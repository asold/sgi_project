    "1. Central Idea\n",
    "    - Idea: We analyze ~18,000 research papers related to Large Language Models and modern AI (LLMs, agentic AI, RAG, foundation models, transformers), downloaded from OpenAlex.\n",
    "        Our goal is to reveal how ideas evolve in this field, and identify:\n",
    "        - which topics dominate the field,\n",
    "        - which papers are most influential,\n",
    "        - which authors and institutions drive the research.\n",
    "    - Why interesting? \n",
    "    LLMs are evolving extremely fast—every month there is a new architecture, agent framework, or RAG improvement. The public sees hype; we want to see the actual scientific movement.We want to know:\n",
    "        - Are today's buzzwords (agents, reasoning, RAG) actually backed by science?\n",
    "        - Who are the “idea hubs” (top-cited papers, institutions)?\n",
    "        - Which topics are emerging vs. declining?\n",
    "    - What datasets were explored? How did I download them? We are exploring a dataset of 20000 papers downloaded from OpenAlex. We used the query with parameters large language model|language model|pretrained language model|foundation model|transformer|LLM|agentic AI|AI agent|tool use|retrieval augmented generation|retrieval-augmented|model context protocol), later than 2000 and must have some references. \n",
    "2. Total Size of the Data. 17891 json files\n",
    "    - Papers Citation Graph: 17891 nodes and 54295 edges\n",
    "    - Co-autors graph: 65931 nodes, 285288 edges\n",
    "    - Author Citation network: 55431 nodes, 2206140 edges\n",
    "3. What is the network? - the oens rpesented above \n",
    "4. What is the text? The text is the actual text of the papers, and if that is absent we will use the abstract\n",
    "5. How will text and networks be tied together? The text will be used to determine the most popular terms in the network, build communities and identify which authors defined popular technologies. "
