Introduction\nIn low power quality conditions instrument transformers ar e\ntransforming distorted signals. In these conditions and fo r\ntransients inductive instrument transformers are charact erized\nby signiﬁcantly worst metrological properties than at rate d\nfrequency of sinusoidal primary signal [1–7]. The increase\nof transformation error for distorted voltage/current wil l in-\ncrease the error of indirect measurements of power and elec-\ntric energy. Derating of the secondary winding load or/and\nprimary current value will prevent deterioration of the CT\n(Current Transformer) metrological properties for distor ted\nsignals and will ensure that the values of errors of indirect\nmeasurements of power and electric energy conforming to the\nlimits resulting from a given CT’s accuracy class. Standard -\nization recommendations concerning instrument transform er\ndo not specify requirements for estimation of their accura-\ncy of distorted signals transformation or to calculate dera t-\ning conditions [8–9]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop\nappropriate measuring methodology and standardization re c-\nommendations of instrument transformers metrological pro p-\nerties estimation for transformation of distorted signals and\nto estimate their primary current and/or secondary winding\nload derating levels in such conditions of operation [6, 10] .\nIn publications [11-13] and standard [14] problem of derati ng\nof transformers for non-sinusoidal load currents is discus sed.\nTransformers are normally designed and built for utilizing at\nrated frequency and perfect sinusoidal load current. Suppl y-\ning non-linear loads by transformer leads to higher losses,\nearly fatigue of insulation, premature defectiveness and r e-\nduction of the useful life of the transformer. T o prevent the se\nproblems, rated capacity of transformers supplying non-li near\nloads must be reduced [11]. Paper [12] presents a new digital\ndata-acquisition method for measuring derating and reacti ve\npower demand of three-phase transformers under full or par-\ntial load conditions. Paper [13] describes an improved dera ting\ntechnique based on direct measurements performed at funda-\nmental and harmonic frequencies. Results of measurements o f\nseveral distribution transformers presented in [13] show t he\nimprovement of this method over the one described in IEEE\nstandard C57.110 [14]. Similar steps as presented in [11–14 ]\nmay be taken for considerations in case of estimation of the\ninductive current transformer derating conditions for dis torted\ncurrents.\n2. Measuring system\nLaboratory studies consisted of the accuracy tests of disto rted\ncurrents transformation through two window-type CT s with\nthe same low voltage insulation system and accuracy class\n(1.2 according to IEEE C57.13 [8], 0.5 according to IEC\n60044-1 [9]) both designed for secondary winding rated load\nof 5 V A (power factor 0.8) with rated transformation ratios\n300 A/5 A and 100 A/5 A. Measuring circuit was powered\nby a programmable power supply, which was able to inject\nadditional harmonics into the output voltage. In this mode o f\noperation distorted voltage particular harmonics levels m ay be\nset manually by the user or by the value of THD factor. Dur-\ning the tests of the CT’s accuracy of transformation in these\ncondition the load of the secondary winding were resistors\n(power factor 1). The rms value of the voltage proportional\nto the diﬀerence between primary and secondary currents of\nthe tested CT was measured through the current probe, which\noutput voltage was measured by the current sense input of the\nﬁrst module of the digital power meter. The lowest possible\nrange of measured voltage of this device external current se n-\nsor input is 25 mV . T o measure the diﬀerence between the\nprimary and secondary currents the wires were led through\nthe probe in such a way that the ﬂux in its magnetic core was\nproportional to the diﬀerence between instantaneous curre nts.\nUsed current probe sensitivity is 1 V/A ±1% [6]. Measuring\nsystem is presented in Fig. 1.\n∗e-mail: michal.kaczmarek@p.lodz.pl\n363\nM. Kaczmarek\nFig. 1. Circuit diagram of the measuring system\nIn Fig. 1 the following notations are used: TCT – T est-\ned Current Transformer, LR – Load Resistor, DPM – Digital\nPower Meter, M1/M2 – ﬁrst/second DPM module, V/I – volt-\nage/current inputs of ﬁrst/second DPM modules, BNC U(I) –\ncurrent sense input of ﬁrst DPM module, CP – Current Probe,\nPPS – Programmable AC Power Supply.\nDuring the measurements (Fig. 1) the wire with 5 A rms\n(tested CT’s with 5 A secondary rms current) supplying cur-\nrent is led through the window of tested CT as many times\nto give a proper number of amp-turns equal its rated primary\ncurrent. If rated primary current rms value of tested window\nCT is 300 A and its secondary current rms value is 5 A, than\nthe wire with 5 A supplying current must be led by the win-\ndow of this CT 60 times. If tested CT is not a window CT ,\nthan additional window CT (previously tested in presented\nin Fig. 1 measuring circuit) must be used in the measuring\nsystem presented in Fig. 2, as a reference CT .\nFig. 2. Circuit diagram of the measuring system with a refere nce CT\nIn Fig. 2 the following additional notations in relation to\nFig. 1 are used: T – supplying Transformer, RCT – Reference\nCurrent Transformer.\nT o determined in measuring system 2 (Fig. 2) values of\ncomposite error/transformer correction factor additiona l error\nresulting from the use of reference CT must be added.\nThe use of a transformer in the supply circuit ensures\nproper for test values of the rms primary current in accor-\ndance with standards [8–9]. Not without signiﬁcance is the\ninﬂuence of the transformer on the waveform of the test sig-\nnal. Therefore, THD U levels of the tested CT primary winding\nsupply voltage are set to ensure proper for tests THD I levels\nof the primary current (distortion of the secondary current\nof the reference current transformer is measured by the ICM\nmodule of the digital power meter).\n3. Measuring procedure\nThe evaluation of a tested CT’s metrological properties for\ntransformation of distorted currents is made on the basis of\ncomposite error deﬁned in the IEC 60044-1 standard for cur-\nrent transformers [6–7, 9]:\nε c = 100\nIp\n\n\n\n\n√\n1\nT\nT∫\n0\n(Knis − ip)2dt, (1)\nKn – rated current ratio of tested CT ; ip, is – instantaneous\nvalues of primary and secondary currents; Ip – rms value of\nprimary current; T – period.\nFor steady-state conditions the composite error is the rms\nvalue of the diﬀerence between the instantaneous values of\nthe primary current, and the instantaneous values of the ac-\ntual secondary current multiplied by the rated transformat ion\nratio. The numeric value of the composite error will never be\nless than the vector sum of the current error and the phase\ndisplacement. Consequently, the composite error always in -\ndicates the highest possible value of current error or phase\ndisplacement. In accordance with IEC standard 60044-1 [9],\nthe composite error is determined for protection CT s and the\nlimiting values of this error for measuring CT s are not deﬁne d\nby this IEC standard but they may be calculated from formula\n(1) for limiting values of current error and phase displacem ent\ndeﬁned in this standard.

During the tests active l oad\npower of the secondary winding was 4 W , due to the fact that\ntested CT is designed for rated apparent power of the sec-\nondary winding equal 5 V A for power factor equal 0.8. Analy-\nsis show that for primary currents rms values equal 300 A\nand 360 A measured composite error values are greater than\nthe calculated limiting values presented in T able 1 ( ±0.9%).\nMeasured values of transformer correction factor are great er\nthan the limiting values ±1.2% for 1.2 accuracy class only\nwhen THD I level reaches 40% (T able 3), but for primary\ncurrent equal 360 A rms no accuracy tests are required by\nthe IEEE C57.13 standard [8]. In condition when secondary\nwinding active load power of tested CT 300 A/5 A is in-\ncreased to 5 W measured values of transformer correction\nfactor for rated primary current are greater than the limiti ng\nvalue for 1.2 accuracy class starting from THD I level equal\n20%. For primary current THD I level equal 40% measured\ntransformer correction factor reaches 2% [6]. Determined i n-\ncrease of composite errors / transformer correction factor s for\nprimary currents rms values equal 300 A and 360 A (T able 3)\nwith the increase of the THD I level will result in increase of\nthe errors of power and electrical energy measurements in lo w\npower quality conditions in indirect circuit with the usage of\nthis tested CT .\nIn T able 4 the results of composite error measurements of\nCT 100 A/5 A for same test conditions are presented.\nT able 4\nThe results of the composite error measurements for the test ed CT\n100 A/5 A and secondary winding active load power equal 4 W\nCT 100 A/5 A, class 0.5 (4 W)\nI1 [A] THD I1 [%] 0 20 30 40\n0.25\nε [%]\n1.2 1.4 1.5 1.5\n1 1.0 1.0 1.1 1.1\n5 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.8\n6 1.2 2.2 X X\nAnalysis of results presented in T able 4 shows that for\nprimary currents rms values to 100 A (rated primary current)\nand THD I levels to 40% measured values of composite error\n/ transformer correction factors are not greater than the li m-\niting values presented respectively in T ables 1 and 2. When\ndistorted primary current reaches 120 A rms composite error\nvalues are greater than the limiting values presented in T a-\nble 1. THD I level above 25% causes saturation of the tested\nCT’s magnetic core and composite error values are greater\nthan 100% (proper operation of tested CT in such conditions\nis impossible). On the basis of results presented in T able 4 i n\ntested conditions for currents from 10% to 100% of rated pri-\nmary current and THD I levels to 40% transformer correction\nfactors determined for this CT are not greater than the lim-\niting values set by the IEEE C57.13 standard [8].

Conclusions\nPresented method for evaluating the accuracy of distorted c ur-\nrents transformation through inductive current transform ers\nenables estimation if tested CT in a given low power qual-\nity conditions will introduce additional errors than resul ting\nfrom its accuracy class during electrical power and energy\nmeasurements.\nIn proposed measuring system CT’s accuracy of transfor-\nmation for sinusoidal and distorted primary currents may be\ntested. For a given percentage value of rated primary curren t\nand given THD I level composite errors / transformer correc-\ntion factors are measured. This enable the possibility to ca lcu-\nlate additional error introduced by tested CT during transf or-\nmation of distorted current in relation to operation condit ions,\nwhere sinusoidal current is transformed. On the basis of the se\nmeasurements derating levels of primary current or/and loa d\nof the secondary winding may be calculated. This will en-\nsure in condition of distorted currents transformation thr ough\nthe CT values of composite errors/transformer correction f ac-\ntors as resulting from the IEC 60044-1/IEEE C57.13 accuracy\nclasses.\nIn case of tested CT s with low voltage insulation system\ndesigned for transformation of relatively small primary cu r-\nrents, when distorted primary signal contain higher harmon -\nics, which frequencies are close to the main primary signal\nfrequency, no increase of composite error/transformer cor rec-\ntion factor caused by deterioration of CT’s metrological pr op-\nerties for primary signal higher frequency components were\nmeasured.\nMoreover, obtained results of the laboratory studies show\nthat some constructions of the inductive CT s are character-\nized by signiﬁcantly higher metrological properties of dis tort-\ned current transformation, in the same measuring condition s,\nthan other. Derating levels of these CT s to ensure values of\ncomposite errors/transformer correction factors as resul ting\nfrom the IEC 60044-1/IEEE C57.13 accuracy classes are rel-\natively smaller.\nAcknowledgements.
