When mon-\nkeys actively used a rake to retrieve food, the receptive fields of these neurons expanded to\ninclude the area near to and occupied by the rake. Subsequent research in humans has shown\nthat responses to visual, tactile, and auditory stimuli that originate near and on tools are modu-\nlated by active tool-use. Changes that arise from active tool-use are thought to reflect that the\ncortical representations of the body and its surrounding space have been updated to accom-\nmodate the new properties offered by the tool (for reviews see [2–5]).\nActive tool-use, and the changes it causes in multisensory processing, have been used to\nstudy the representations of both the body and peripersonal space. Here we define body repre-\nsentation as the mental model of the body, based on proprioceptive and sensory information\nabout the body’s state [6], for reviews, see [7–9]. This representation is flexible, and a small\ndegree of distortion has been demonstrated in normal cognition [10]. Peripersonal space is\ndefined as the areas that directly surround the body that we can act upon [11], and that can\ncontain objects that we may need to react to (for reviews, see [5, 12–15]). The body and its\nrepresentation are the centre of peripersonal space [16], hence these representations are to\nsome degree related, and active tool-use can influence both. For instance, Canzoneri and col-\nleagues [17] used an audio-tactile interaction task to assess peripersonal space, and a landmark\ntask and tactile distance perception to examine body representation, before and after partici-\npants used a tool to retrieve distant objects. The results showed that following tool-use partici-\npants perceived their arm as narrower and longer, and representations of peripersonal space\nsurrounding the arms were extended along the axis of the tool. Therefore, active tool-use pro-\nvides an opportunity to study how body and peripersonal space representations are updated.\nRepresentations of the body and space are distorted in people with neurological disorders\nlike asomatognosia [18] and hemispatial neglect [19–21]. Body representation is also distorted\nin people with certain types of chronic pain (for reviews see [22–24]). For instance, people\nwith chronic back pain often report a distorted sense of the size of their body near their painful\narea, or that parts of the body feel like they are missing [25]. Similarly, people with Complex\nRegional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) can report difficulties locating and recognising their affected\nlimb, show a distorted perception of its size, and have difficulties locating touch on their\naffected hand (e.g. [26–33]). Distorted spatial representations have also been reported in peo-\nple with pathological pain conditions. For instance, people with unilateral hand amputations\nunderestimate the size of near space on the side of their amputation, compared to the contra-\nlateral side [34]. In CRPS patients, biases in visual and tactile attention away from the affected\nhand have been identified by asking patients to judge the temporal order of pairs of tactile sti-\nmuli delivered to, or visual stimuli projected near to or onto, the hands [35–38]. Estimates of\nthe point in space that is straight ahead of the body midline made in complete darkness,\nthought to reflect the division between left and right space in an egocentric reference frame\n[39], are also deviated in people with CRPS. Such deviations in spatial perception have been\nreported in the direction of the affected side [40–42], and leftwards irrespectively of the\naffected side [43], although not all studies find evidence of deviations [44–46]. Furthermore,\nSumitani and colleagues [40] found that the deviation towards the CRPS-affected side was\nreduced following pain reduction through a using a nerve block. Taken together, these studies\ndemonstrate that bodily and spatial representations can be distorted in pathological pain con-\nditions. What is unclear, however, is whether pain (or associated factors such as immobility\nand disuse) precede, or follow (e.g. [47]), these altered representations.\nResearch has started to investigate the effect of pain on spatial perception and the represen-\ntation of the body in normal cognition. Pain itself is a sensory and affective phenomenon [48]\nthat can be shaped by multisensory experiences [49] and convey spatial information about the\nbody [23]. After participants were subjected to painful heat stimulation on one hand, their\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 2 / 21\nsubjective body midline shifted towards the painful side, whereas vibrotactile stimulation had\nthe opposite effect [50]. This suggests that pain can modify spatial perception in ways that can-\nnot sufficiently be explained by attentional cueing effects. To date, only one study looked\ndirectly at how pain might alter the representation of the body in healthy subjects. Gandevia\nand Phegan [51] found that participants reported an average of 10% increase in the perceived\nsize of their thumb after it had been subject to painful cooling. These studies suggest that pain\nmight alter the representations of the body and its surrounding space, however the evidence is\nlimited. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of pain on the\nupdating of peripersonal space and body representation (e.g. following tool-use).\nOur study aimed to investigate the effect of induced pain on the updating of peripersonal\nspace and body representations of healthy individuals during and following tool-use. Over\nthree separate sessions, participants completed a tool-use task while experiencing capsaicin-\ninduced pain in their dominant arm, and in two control conditions: active placebo and neutral\n(i.e., no sensory manipulation). We hypothesised that inducing pain in an arm would impair\nparticipants’ ability to update peripersonal space and body representations relative to the other\nconditions. We used a crossmodal congruency task (CCT) and tactile distance judgements\n(TDJs) to measure updating of peripersonal space and body representation, respectively.\nThe CCT has been used previously to investigate the effects of active tool-use on spatial rep-\nresentations [3, 4]. In this task, participants make judgements about vibrotactile targets pre-\nsented to the hands through the handles of the crossed or uncrossed tools while ignoring\nvisual or auditory distractors presented at the tips of the tools. After the participants have used\nthe tools actively, distractors on the same side of space as the targets typically have a larger\neffect on increasing reaction times and/or error rates when the tools are uncrossed than when\nthe tools are crossed [52]. In contrast, distractors on the opposite side of space as the targets\nhave a larger effect on performance when the tools are crossed than when the tools are\nuncrossed. That is, after tool-use, distractors have a greater interference effect when they origi-\nnate from the same tool as targets, rather than from the same side of space as the target. Mara-\nvita and colleagues [52] interpreted this pattern to indicate a change in peripersonal space\nrepresentations (although see Holmes [53] for an alternative interpretation), which was further\nsuggested by the fact that this interference pattern only developed from active tool-use but did\nnot develop when tools were held passively. We predicted that pain would interfere with the\nemergence of tool-specific effects of distractors on judgements made about the targets. That is,\nwe expected to see a weaker interaction between the arrangement of the tools, the visual field\nin which visual distractors appear relative to vibrotactile targets, and the vertical congruence of\nvisual distractors relative to vibrotactile targets for the pain condition, relative to the two con-\ntrol conditions.\nTDJs have been used to measure updating of body representation following tool-use. Dis-\ntances between two touched locations on the arm that are oriented parallel to the axis of the\ntool are perceived to be shorter after active tool-use. This is thought to indicate that body\nrepresentation is altered by tool-use, such that the forearm is perceived to be longer [17, 54–\n57]. We predicted that pain would interfere with the degree to which tool-use altered TDJs,\nsuch that distance estimates would have a smaller decrease when participants were in pain.\nMethods\nDesign\nWe used a repeated-measures design with three sessions, corresponding to three sensory con-\nditions: Pain, active placebo, and neutral (i.e., no sensory manipulation). We used a Crossmo-\ndal Congruency Task (CCT) adapted from Maravita and colleagues [52] to measure changes\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 3 / 21\nin peripersonal space and Tactile Distance judgements (TDJs) adapted from Canzoneri and\ncolleagues [17], Miller and colleagues [54, 56], Longo and Haggard [55], and Taylor-Clarke\nand colleagues [57] to measure changes in body representation. We wanted to know if the\neffects of unilateral pain induction would be specific to the stimulated arm, or global (i.e.\nextend to the unstimulated arm), by comparing CCT and TDJ performance between the two\narms. In addition to these tasks, we also used several measures to monitor the sensory and cog-\nnitive effects of the sensory manipulations. We asked participants to give numerical ratings of\npain intensity. We also used sensory testing (Mechanical Pain Threshold, Mechanical Detec-\ntion Threshold, Two Point Discrimination Threshold), and questionnaire measures (The Bath\nCRPS Body Perception Disturbance Scale [BPD; [58]], the Short-Form McGill Pain Question-\nnaire 2 [SF-MPQ-2; [59]]), to characterise any secondary changes caused by our sensory\nmanipulation. The protocol was preregistered on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/\n8fduw/register/565fb3678c5 e4a66b5582f67).\nParticipants\nThirty-one participants completed the study tasks under three sensory conditions (pain, active\nplacebo, and neutral) in a randomized, counterbalanced order. One person was excluded\nbecause she did not report any pain (0/10 on a Numerical Rating Scale [NRS]) for 40 minutes\nfollowing the application of capsaicin, even when we attempted this condition on a second\noccasion. One person repeated the pain condition (their session 1) due to low pain ratings in\nthe first attempt that was completed (M NRS after the sensory manipulation period during the\nfirst attempt 0.6/10, SD = 0.97 and the second attempt 1.4/10, SD 0.70). One person repeated\nthe neutral condition (their session 3) due to equipment malfunctioning during the CCT. The\nrepeated sessions were completed in full, and took place on a different day. The mean age of\nthe final sample was 21.6 years (SD = 4.3), of which 22 (73.3%) were women. Two participants\nwere left-handed (M = -70.0, SD = 14.1), one ambidextrous (score of 30), and the remaining 27\nwere right-handed (M = 83.6, SD = 17.7), as indicated by the Edinburgh Handedness Inven-\ntory [60], in which extreme left and right handedness is indicated by scores of -100 and 100,\nand scores between 40 and -40 indicate ambidextrousness. All participants reported having\nnormal or corrected to normal vision, and that they did not have a chronic pain condition.\nParticipants with self-reported sensitive skin, epilepsy, high blood pressure, recent heart prob-\nlems, a history of stroke, vascular problems, an allergy to capsaicin, or who were pregnant or\nbreastfeeding were excluded to satisfy local safety guidelines for the use of capsaicin cream.\nParticipants signed consent and safety forms prior to participating, and consented for their\ndata to be used upon completion of the study. The study adhered to the 2013 Declaration of\nHelsinki, and received approval from the local ethics committee (Psychology Research Ethics\nCommittee, Department of Psychology, University of Bath, UK. Approval Number: 16–236).\nParticipants received £30 for their involvement.\nMaterials\nFor the pain condition, a 1cm wide band of Ungentum cream infused with a 1% concentration\nof capsaicin (the Specials Laboratory, United Kingdom), amounting to approximately 5g of\ncream, was applied to the dominant arm, just proximal to the elbow. For the ambidextrous\nperson, the cream was applied to the right arm because this was the participant’s self-reported\ndominant side. The cream was contained within two bands of microporous tape, and covered\nwith cling film. This was fitted so that participants could flex and extend their elbow with ease,\nso as not to impede their ability to manoeuvre the tools. Applying a band of capsaicin that\nreaches around the arm in this location generates a burning pain that penetrates into the arm\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 4 / 21\n[61], and is accompanied by cutaneous vasodilation and hyperalgesia [62]. This method has\nbeen used previously [61, 63]. For the active placebo, a ‘warm-up’ gel (Elite Ozone) was used\nto create a non-painful warming sensation. The site and application procedures were identical\nto that of the capsaicin. No cream was applied in the neutral condition.\nThe final design of the CCT was informed by pilot research (n = 42). The materials used\nwere based on the study by Maravita and colleagues [52]. Two 75cm long tools (see Fig 1) that\nresembled golf clubs were constructed from aluminium. Two red Light Emitting Diodes\n(LEDs) were embedded in the distal end of each tool. Two electromagnetic solenoid-type stim-\nulators (Tactor Minature Stimulators, Dancer Design, United Kingdom) were embedded in\neach of the handles to deliver vibrotactile stimulation. The LEDs and vibrotactile stimulators\nwere controlled by a 4-channel amplifier (TactAmp 4.2, Dancer Design, United Kingdom)\noperated by Matlab 2014b (MathWorks). On each tool, one LED and one vibrotactile stimula-\ntor was positioned above the central axis of the tool, and one LED and one vibrotactile stimula-\ntor below it. The tools had wooden pegs attached vertically to their far ends, near the LEDs, in\nthe ‘blades’ of the tools. The pegs slotted into holes in a wooden board (80 x 100 cm) that were\n15 cm away from the distal end of the board, and 15 cm to the left and right from the central\naxis of the board. This ensured that the ends of the tools were always placed in the same posi-\ntion regardless of whether the tools were crossed or uncrossed. A fixation light was located at\nthe central axis of the board, 15cm from the distal end. A 5 cm wide blue mark was placed on\nthe handle of each tool 30 cm away from the distal end to indicate points at which participants\nshould cross the tools. Two triple switch foot pedals (Scythe, USA) with custom software were\nused to collect participants’ responses. White noise was played on headphones to mask any\nsound of the vibrotactile stimulation. A chinrest was used to ensure that participant’s heads\nremained in a consistent position. Two webcams were positioned in line with participant’s sag-\nittal plane, at the end of and 20 cm away from the board, so that the experimenter could moni-\ntor gaze throughout the task, and record participant’s movements for offline evaluation of\nmovement quality.\nTwo flat-ended circular rods (1 mm diameter) were used for tactile distance judgements\n(TDJs). They were attached to a bow compass, so that the distance between them could be\naccurately adjusted. Mechanical Pain Threshold was assessed using seven pinprick stimulators\n(MRC Systems GmbH, Germany), ranging from 8 mN to 512 mN in force. Twenty Von Frey\nFilaments were used to measure Mechanical Detection Threshold (BioSeb, France), ranging\nfrom 0.008 g to 300 g in weight. Two Point Discrimination Threshold was quantified using an\nExacta™ two-point discriminator (North Coast Medical, USA), ranging from distances of 2\nFig 1. Tool-use materials. From left to right, the images depict the uncross ed (A), and crossed (B) tools, and a close-\nup of the end of a tool (C). The tools have red Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) embedded at the far ends of the tools, and\nvibrotacti le stimulators embedded in the handles. A vertical peg was attached to the far ends of the tools (white oval),\nwhich slotted into holes in the wooden board to ensure the position of the tips of the tools was consistent for crossed\nand uncross ed trials (C). An off-white LED fixation point was positioned with equal distance to the ends of both tools.\nA webcam was placed in line with the fixation light and the chinrest, which were aligned with participants ’ sagittal\nplane.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0210045.g0 01\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 5 / 21\nmm to 20 mm in distance. A handheld infrared thermometer with an 8:1 distance to spot size\nratio, and a red laser aim was used to measure the temperature of participants’ hands.\nThe BPD [58] is an unvalidated 7-item questionnaire designed to characterise distorted\nbody perception in CRPS. In includes questions about the awareness of, attention to, emo-\ntional valance of, and desire to amputate the affected area. For this study, participants were\ninstructed to answer about the stimulated (dominant) arm. Scores can range from 0 to 57,\nwhere a higher score indicates greater distorted body perception. We included this measure\nbecause we were interested in how experimental pain induction might give rise to distortions\nof the body representation, and if this was similar to what is typically reported by people with\npathological pain (e.g. CRPS).\nThe SF-MPQ-2 [59] is a 24-item questionnaire assessing the symptoms of neuropathic and\nnon-neuropathic pain. Participants rate the intensity of their pain for each of 22 pain qualities\n(e.g. sharp, aching, hot-burning) on a scale of 0 (‘none’) to 10 (‘worst possible’). The SF-MPQ-\n2 has been validated for acute pain populations [64]. We included this measure to better char-\nacterise the different dimensions of participants’ pain experiences.\nProcedure\nFig 2 shows an outline of the procedure for each session. Informed written consent was\nobtained and self-reported handedness was recorded upon commencing the first session.\nThen, the first set of sensory tests (i.e. Mechanical Pain Threshold, Mechanical Detection\nThreshold, Two Point Discrimination) were performed on the middle finger (digit 3) of the\ndominant and non-dominant hands. Mechanical Pain Threshold, and Mechanical Detection\nThreshold were assessed following a standardised protocol [65]. Five values for each sub-\nthreshold and suprathreshold were recorded for each sensory test. That is, we recorded when\ntouch was detected or not for the Mechanical Detection Threshold; sharp and blunt sensations\nfor the Mechanical Pain Threshold; and the distance (mm) at which two points were perceived\nas one or two were recorded the Two Point Discrimination. Then the capsaicin cream or\n‘warm-up’ gel was applied for the pain and active placebo conditions, respectively. Pain ratings\nand dominant hand temperature were recorded every minute following cream application in\nthe Pain and Active Placebo conditions, or upon completion of sensory testing in the Neutral\ncondition. To allow the capsaicin to take effect, we waited until participants’ pain ratings\nexceeded 5/10, or until three identical consecutive ratings >2/10 were given. Based on piloting\nand past research [61], we expected this to take approximately 15 minutes. Consequently, in\nthe two control conditions, we waited for 15 min between the first and second set of sensory\ntests. In all three conditions, participants viewed a nature video deemed low in arousal [66]\nFig 2. Procedure for each experime ntal session. During the sensory manipu lation phase the experime nter applied a\ncapsaicin cream (pain condition) or warm-up gel (active placebo condition) to the participant ’s dominant arm, or\nthere was no manipulati on (neutral condition) . During the passive stage (set 1) of the Crossmo dal Congruenc y task\n(CCT) the experiment er changed the tools between the crossed and uncrossed positions. During the active stages of\nthe CCT (sets 2–4) participa nts manoeuvre d the tools themsel ves when changing position. The interactive tool-use\ntask involve d retrieving and sorting beanbags, using the same tools that were used for the CCT (see Fig 1).\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0210045.g0 02\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 6 / 21\nand engaged in light conversation with the experimenter during the waiting period. Then we\nconducted a second set of sensory tests, and participants completed the BPD and SF-MPQ-2.\nWe then administered the first TDJ task. The participant sat with their head in the chin rest\nwith their eyes open and gripped the uncrossed tools. The experimenter applied the flat-ended\ncircular rods to along the radial side of the participant’s forearm (i.e. proximal-distally). Three\ndistances (4, 6, and 8 cm) were presented on one arm in a randomised counterbalanced order,\nwith one repetition for each distance. After the three TDJ trials were completed, the procedure\nwas repeated for the second arm. The order in which the arms were tested was randomised\nand counterbalanced. Participants indicated the estimated distance between the two felt points\nusing a diagram of 22 lines of different lengths ranging from 0.6 cm to 11.5 cm, in 0.5 cm\nincrements, presented on an A4 sheet of paper.\nAfter the first TDJ task, participants were instructed on how to perform the CCT. On each\ntrial, participants identified the location of three 50 ms bursts of vibrotactile stimulation deliv-\nered to the thumb or middle finger of the left or right hand from the vibrotactile stimulators\nembedded in the handles of the tools. Three flashes of 50 ms from the red LEDs at the ends of\nthe tools preceded each vibrotactile stimulation by 30ms to maximise the crossmodal interfer-\nence [67]. Participants judged the location of the vibrotactile stimulation as either on the\nthumb (upper) or finger (lower), and if it was delivered to the left or right hand. Visual distrac-\ntors provided no information about the location of the target vibrotactile stimulation. Partici-\npants indicated the location of the vibrotactile stimulation by pressing foot pedals using their\nheel (finger; “lower”) or toes (thumb; “upper”) of their left or right foot. Participants were\ninstructed to respond as quickly and as accurately as possible. Incorrect responses and\nresponses slower than 3000 ms caused all four LEDs to flash three times to provide feedback to\nthe participants.\nParticipants completed four Sets of the CCT. Within each set were trials in which the tools\nwere positioned in uncrossed or crossed positions. In the first set of the CCT (the “passive”\nset), the experimenter changed the position of the tools half-way through while the participants\nkept hold of the handles, comparable to the control experiment reported by Maravita and col-\nleagues [52]. The order of tool arrangements (crossed or uncrossed) was counterbalanced\nbetween participants. For the remaining three sets of the CCT (the “active” sets), participants\nactively changed the arrangement of the tools between crossed and uncrossed every four trials.\nThe cue to change arrangement was all four LEDs illuminating. Before commencing the first\n(passive) CCT set, participants completed a practice set of 16 trials during which they held the\ntools still and uncrossed to ensure that they understood the CCT task. The practice set was\nrepeated until the participant responded correctly on >80% of trials.\nThe CCT enabled the evaluation of the effect of the visual distractors on detection of vibro-\ntactile stimulation depending on whether tools were uncrossed or crossed (Tool Arrange-\nment), the distractor was in the same or the opposite side of space as the target (Visual Field),\nand the distractor was in the same or the opposite vertical elevation as the target (Congruence).\nAll possible combinations of Tool Arrangement, Visual Field, and Congruence relative to the\nvibrotactile target were delivered in a random order over every 32 trials. Each set was com-\nprised of 96 trials, giving 384 trials per session. Using this procedure, we could also examine\nchanges in the effect of the distractors over time by comparing performance in the four sets.\nActively changing the tool arrangement was the key manipulation in Maravita and col-\nleagues’ [52] study to elicit the changes to CCT performance generated by active tool-use.\nHowever, following piloting, we added an additional interactive tool-use tasks in-between the\nsecond and third, and third and fourth sets of the CCT to amplify the desired effect. The task\nconsisted of approximately 5 minutes of using the tools to sort and retrieve distant beanbags,\nusing the same equipment as for the CCT. Participants sorted beanbags by colour, and\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 7 / 21\nretrieved them from the distal end of the board to coloured squares (see Fig 1) on either the\nleft of right side of the board’s proximal end. This was inspired by comparable paradigms\ninvolving active tool-use [68–70]. Upon completion of the last set of the CCT the second set of\nTDJs was administered, and the second set of sensory testing was conducted. Each session\nlasted approximately 2 hours.\nIn addition to the pain ratings recorded during the pain ramp-up period in the pain condi-\ntion, or for 15 minutes in the active placebo and neutral conditions, participants provided an\nadditional 12 pain ratings between different experimental tasks. They provided pain rating\nbefore each set of TDJs, and two rating for the first CCT set (passive), and then before and\nafter each of the active CCT sets.\nAnalyses\nWe examined error rates and reaction times (RTs) from the crossmodal congruency task in\nseparate 3x4x2x2x2x2 repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs). The independent\nvariables for the CCT were the Sensory Condition (pain, active placebo, neutral), Set (set 1\n[passive], set 2, set 3, set 4), Side of Body on which the vibrotactile stimulation occurred\n(dominant, non-dominant), Tool Arrangement (uncrossed, crossed), Visual Field in which\nthe distractor occurred relative to the target (same, opposite), and Congruence (congruent,\nincongruent). The median RTs and percentage of errors were calculated within level of the rel-\nevant conditions, after excluding trials with RTs <200 ms or >3000 ms. Only trials with cor-\nrect responses were used to calculate the median RTs. The critical interaction that we were\ninterested in was that between Tool Arrangement, Visual Field, and Congruence. Therefore,\nonly interactions involving all three factors Tool Arrangement, Visual Field, and Congruence\nwere considered relevant for addressing the aim of the study. We also considered that the\nthree-way interaction should normally develop over time spent engaged in active tool-use (as\nreported by Maravita and colleagues [52]), which would result in interactions involving the\nfour factors Set, Tool Arrangement, Visual Field, and Congruence. In their study [52], tool-\nuse-dependent effects were only significant for RTs, not for error rates. Therefore, to be con-\ncise we will only report results from the RTs of the CCT in the main article (see S1 Text for\nthe results of CCT error rate analyses). To aid interpretation of the results, we subtracted con-\ngruent from incongruent trials to calculate crossmodal interference for follow-up contrasts.\nA mean score for the TDJs was computed for each Sensory Condition (pain, active placebo,\nneutral), Set (pre tool-use, post tool-use), and Side of Body (dominant, non-dominant), and\nanalysed using a 3x2x2 repeated-measures ANOVA.\nMechanical Pain Threshold, Mechanical Detection Threshold, and Two Point Discrimina-\ntion Threshold were calculated as geometric means of each value for which a participant’s\nresponses changed (e.g. from blunt to sharp for Mechanical Pain Threshold). Performance on\nsensory tests was analysed using ANOVAs with Sensory Condition (pain, active placebo, neu-\ntral), Set (pre manipulation, post manipulation), and Side of Body (dominant, non-dominant)\nas independent variables. For subsequent covariate analyses, changes on the sensory tests were\ncalculated by subtracting pre- from post-sensory manipulation scores, within each level of Sen-\nsory Condition (pain, active placebo, neutral) for the dominant (stimulated) side of the body.\nThe 12 pain ratings recorded after the sensory manipulation period (i.e. between sets of TDJs\nand CCT) were averaged across tasks, within each level of Sensory Condition, for each partici-\npant, for covariate analysis. Changes in hand temperature were calculated by subtracting the\nfirst recording (i.e. 1 minute after the sensory manipulation) from the last recording (e.g.\nafter 15 minutes for the active placebo and neutral conditions), for each participant and within\neach level of Sensory Condition. To evaluate if there were any differences in participants’\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 8 / 21\nmovements across the three sessions that could account for any difference between the effects\nof tool-use, movements were scored by a research assistant from video recordings taken during\nthe first and last two minutes of the active CCT, and during the interactive tool-use task. The\nresearch assistant, who was blind to the hypotheses and task conditions, rated the speed, ease,\nand control of movement in each video from 0 (‘worst imaginable’) to 10 (‘best imaginable’).\nA mean value was calculated from the speed, ease, and control of movement for each session,\nwithin each participant. Age, the total score for the SF-MPQ-2, BPD, change in hand tempera-\nture, average pain ratings, and changes on sensory tests from pre to post sensory manipulation\nwere explored as covariates in analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) of the CCT and TDJ.\nGreenhouse-Geisser corrections were used when sphericity was not satisfied.

The mean pain ratings\naveraged across the TDJs and CCT tasks were 5.06 (SD = 1.88) for the pain condition, 0.27\n(SD = 0.46) for the active placebo condition, and 0.02 (SD = 0.06) for the neutral condition.\nPain ratings for the pain condition were significantly higher than both the active placebo,\nt(29) = 14.16, p\nadjusted\n< .001, d = 5.26, and neutral conditions, t(29) = 14.70, p\nadjusted\n< .001,\nd = 5.46. Participants also reported higher pain in the active placebo condition than the neutral\ncondition, t(29) = 2.84, p\nadjusted\n= .030, d = 1.06. Overall, these results show the capsaicin\ncream induced significant pain relative to the other two conditions, without influencing move-\nment ratings or hand temperature.\nThere were no changes in Two Point Discrimination Threshold (M = 0.00 mm, SD = 0.25)\nor in Mechanical Detection Threshold (M = 0.00 g, SD = 0.01) from pre to post sensory manip-\nulation when considered across all three sensory manipulations, or any two-way interactions\nof Time with Sensory Condition or Side of Body Fs � 2.99, ps � .094, η\n2\np\n� .09 (See S1 Table).\nFor Mechanical Pain Threshold there was an interaction between Sensory Condition x Time x\nSide of Body, F(2, 28) = 4.42, p = .021, η\n2\np\n= .24. This reflected that there was an increase in\nMechanical Pain Threshold for the dominant (stimulated) arm in the pain condition, t(29) =\n2.34, p\nadjusted\n= .048, d = 0.87, as Mechanical Pain Threshold increased from pre (M = 178.3\nmN, SD = 136.8) to post (M = 224.6 mN, SD = 161.5) the application of capsaicin cream.

When ana-\nlysed within each Sensory Condition, the covariates did not consistently interact with either\nRTs from the CCT, error rates from the CCT, or TDJ. That is, no covariate interacted signifi-\ncantly across each Sensory Condition for any outcome measure. Therefore, no covariates were\nincluded for further analysis.\nCrossmodal congruency task\nAll significant main effects and interactions for RTs are reported in S2 Table. There were main\neffects of Set, F(3, 27) = 45.10, p < .001, η\n2\np\n= .83, Side of Body, F(1, 29) = 7.97, p = .009, η\n2\np\n=\n.22, Visual Field, F(1, 29) = 6.69, p = .015, η\n2\np\n= .19, and Congruence F(1, 29) = 177.18, p <\n.001, η\n2\np\n= .86, on reaction times for the CCT. Reaction times became shorter for each set of\nthe CCT (set 1 [passive]: M = 707.9 ms, SD = 101.88; set 2: M = 694.5 ms, SD = 93.40; set 3:\nM = 648.4 ms, SD = 92.02; set 4: M = 629.6 ms, SD = 97.49). Except for the difference between\nset 1 and 2 (t(29) = 1.57, p\nadjusted\n< .128, d = 0.28), all follow-up comparisons showed a signifi-\ncant decrease in reaction time over time, ts(29) � 3.46, ps\nadjusted\n� .004, ds � 1.29. Participants\nresponded faster to vibrotactile stimulation on their dominant (M = 660.3 ms, SD = 92.02) than\ntheir non-dominant (M = 679.9 ms, SD = 98.59) hand. Reaction times were shorter when visual\ndistractors appeared in the same (M = 667.3 ms, SD = 93.66) than the opposite (M = 672.9 ms,\nSD = 93.66) visual field relative to vibrotactile targets. Responses were slower when visual distrac-\ntors were incongruent (M = 693.3 ms, SD = 95.30) than congruent (M = 646.9 ms, SD = 92.57)\nwith vertical vibrotactile target locations.\nThe most important finding with regards to our hypothesis was that no interactions of\ninterest involving Sensory Condition, Tool Arrangement, Visual Field, and Congruence were\nobserved, indicating that pain did not interfere with the reaction times on the CCT. Most\nimportantly, there was no significant interaction for Sensory Condition x Tool Arrangement x\nVisual Field x Congruence, F(1.66, 48.21) = 0.80, p = .434, η\n2\np\n= .03.\nThe critical three-way interaction for testing the effects of tool-use on peripersonal space,\nbetween Tool Arrangement, Visual Field, and Congruence, was significant F(1, 29) = 9.43, p =\n.005, η\n2\np\n= .25 (Fig 2). The follow-up analyses showed that there was a significant difference\nbetween incongruent and congruent distractors within each level of Tool Arrangement and\nVisual Field (see S3 Table), ts(29) � 5.29, ps\nadjusted\n� .004, ds � 1.96. Therefore, we calculated\nthe crossmodal interference by subtracting congruent from incongruent scores, and compared\nthis across each level of Tool Arrangement and Visual Field to evaluate what drove this interac-\ntion (Fig 3). For uncrossed tools, crossmodal interference was greater when the visual distrac-\ntors appeared in the same (M = 72.2, SD = 29.6) than the opposite (M = 27.1, SD = 28.1) visual\nfield to the vibrotactile targets, t(29) = 6.43, p\nadjusted\n= .004, d = 2.39. When the tools were\ncrossed, crossmodal interference was also greater when the visual distractors appeared in the\nsame (M = 54.2, SD = 35.0) than the opposite (M = 31.3, SD = 21.7) visual field relative to the\nvibrotactile targets, t(29) = 3.31, p\nadjusted\n= .009, d = 0.61, although the effect size was smaller\nthan when tools were uncrossed. When visual distractors appeared in the same visual field as\nthe vibrotactile targets, crossmodal interference was greater for the uncrossed than the crossed\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 10 / 21\ntools, t(29) = 3.42, p\nadjusted\n= .014, d = 1.27. There was no difference in crossmodal interference\nwhen visual distractors appeared in the visual field opposite the vibrotactile targets, t(29) =\n0.80, p\nadjusted\n= .438, d = 0.30. These results suggest that peripersonal space representations\nwere updated as a function of tool-use because the arrangement of the tools impacted on the\nRTs from the CCT. This is evidenced by the decreased effect size when comparing visual dis-\ntractors appearing in the same or opposite side, giving rise to the critical three-way interaction.\nThe results of the analysis of error rates (S1 Text) were broadly consistent with the results of\nthe analysis of reaction times.\nA four-way interaction between the factors Set, Tool Arrangement, Visual Field and Congru-\nence on RTs for the CCT was also observed (Fig 4), F(2.41, 70.09) = 3.28, p = .035, η\n2\np\n= .10.\nSeparate three-way ANOVAs of Tool Arrangement x Visual Field x Congruence for each Set\nrevealed significant three-way interaction for only the first two sets (set 1 [passive]: F(1, 29) =\n8.89, p = .006, η\n2\np\n= .24; set 2: F(1, 29) = 11.09, p = .002, η\n2\np\n= .28). This interaction was not pres-\nent in set 3, F(1, 29) = 0.39, p = .536, η\n2\np\n= .01, or set 4, F(1, 29) = 0.11, p = .748, η\n2\np\n< .01. To\nfurther investigate these patterns of results we calculated the crossmodal interference and com-\npared this across each level of Tool Arrangement and Visual Field with each set (Fig 4).\nFollow-up analysis (see S3 Table) of the crossmodal interference scores showed significantly\ngreater interference for same side than opposite side distractors for uncrossed tools for set 1 (pas-\nsive), t(29) = 4.84, p\nadjusted\n< .001, d = 1.80, set 2, t(29) = 5.59, p\nadjusted\n= .004, d = 2.08, and set 3,\nt(29) = 3.77, p\nadjusted\n= .004, d = 1.40, but not for set 4, t(29) = 1.98, p\nadjusted\n= .124, d = 0.74.\nCrossmodal interference was also greater for same side compared to opposite side distractors\nwhen tools were crossed for set 1 (passive), t(29) = 2.76, p\nadjusted\n= .042, d = 1.03, set 2, t(29) =\n2.74, p\nadjusted\n= .015, d = 1.00, set 3, t(29) = 2.45, p\nadjusted\n= .048, d = 1.00, and set 4, t(29) = 2.84,\np\nadjusted\n= .012, d = 1.05. For visual distractors appearing in the opposite visual field relative to\nvibrotactile targets, crossmodal interference was greater for crossed than uncrossed tools for set\n1, t(29) = 2.78, p\nadjusted\n= .042, d = 1.03. There were no significant differences for opposite visual\nfield distractors between crossed and uncrossed tools for sets 2 and 3 ts(29) � 2.30, ps\nadjusted\n�\n.058, ds � 0.85. For set 4, however, crossmodal interference was greater for uncrossed than\ncrossed tools, when visual distractors appeared in the opposite visual field relative to vibrotactile\ntargets, t(29) = 3.09, p\nadjusted\n= .045 , d = 1.15.

This was unexpected, given that set 1 required\nonly passive interaction with the tools. We considered that this could be due to the repeated-\nmeasures design of the study. That is, experience with the tool in session 1 might have primed\nparticipants to rapidly embody the tools upon grasping the handles of the tools at the begin-\nning of sessions 2 and 3, extending peripersonal space even while passively interacting with the\ntools. Because the order of the study was counterbalanced, we could investigate this possibility\nFig 4. Crossmoda l interferen ce–four-wa y interactio n.

That is, in this exploratory analysis Sensory Con-\ndition was treated as a between-subjects factor with ten participants in each of the pain, active\nplacebo, and neutral groups. We conducted two five-way ANOVAs on the RTs and error rates\nfrom the first experimental session with Set, Side of Body, Tool Arrangement, Visual Field and\nCongruence as within-subjects factors; and Sensory Condition as a between-subjects factor.\nThere was no main effect of Sensory Condition on RTs from the CCT, F(2, 27) = 0.97, p =\n.390, η\n2\np\n= .07. There was no clear effect of Sensory Condition or any interactions of interest\nfor error rates from the CCT during session 1 (see S1 Text). Furthermore, when the session\norder was included as a variable in the main analysis there was no change to the key interaction\nterms. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the apparent extension of peripersonal space during\nthe first set of the CCT can be attributed to familiarity with the tools due to the repeated-mea-\nsures design of the study.\nTo test for any immediate effects of pain on peripersonal space and body representations,\nwe also reanalysed the baseline data from the first session (i.e. prior to tool-use, and treating\nSensory Condition as a between-groups factor). We also followed-up these analyses with\nBayesian repeated-measures ANOVAs using JASP software [72]. To calculate the adjusted\nBF\n10\n, we divided the posterior probability of the models, or P(M|data), from the model that\nincluded the interaction term of interest, by the model containing all other elements of the\nfirst model except from the interaction term of interest [73]. For the CCT, there was no evi-\ndence of an interaction between Sensory Condition, Tool Arrangement, Visual Field, and\nCongruence prior to active tool-use (i.e. during Set 1) for reaction times, F(2, 27) = 1.10, p =\n.348, η\n2\np\n= .08 (adjusted BF\n10\n= 0.40), or for error rates, F(2, 27) = 1.50, p = .241, η\n2\np\n= .10\n(adjusted BF\n10\n= 1.45). There was no evidence of a difference between Sensory Conditions on\nTDJs prior to tool-use, F(2, 27) = 1.21, p = .313, η\n2\np\n= .08 (adjusted BF\n10\n= 0.46). However, as\nthe Bayesian analysis shows, we did not find evidence of no difference between Sensory condi-\ntions at prior to tool-use on the CCT or the TDJs [74].\nTo explore the evidence for the null hypothesis, we reanalysed the main interaction terms\nfrom the CCT and TDJs that involved Sensory Condition with Bayesian ANOVAs. We found\nmoderate evidence [74] of no effect of an interaction between Sensory Condition, Tool\nArrangement, Visual Field, and Congruence on RTs from the CCT (adjusted BF\n10\n= 0.12). We\nalso found moderate evidence of no effect of an interaction between Sensory Condition and\nSet on TDJs (adjusted BF\n10\n= 0.24). These findings support our interpretation that pain induc-\ntion did not interfere with the updating of peripersonal space and body representations.\nDiscussion\nOur study aimed to investigate the effect of induced pain on updating of peripersonal space\nand body representations during and following tool-use. We hypothesised that participants\nwould be less able to update peripersonal space and body representations during pain induc-\ntion to the arm, compared to the two control conditions. We used a crossmodal congruency\ntask (CCT) and tactile distance judgements (TDJs) to measure updating of peripersonal space\nand body representations, respectively. The global patterns of the CCT and TDJ were consis-\ntent with previously reported effects of tool-use (e.g. [52, 54]). In contrast to our predictions,\nwe found that pain did not interfere with updating of peripersonal space and body representa-\ntions following active tool-use, when compared to two control conditions (i.e. active placebo,\nand neutral). That is, we found evidence that the performance on the CCT and TDJ did not\ndiffer between sensory conditions. There was also no significant difference in the CCT or TDJ\nwhen we explored pain ratings as a covariate. Therefore, experimentally induced pain does not\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 13 / 21\nappear to influence the updating of peripersonal space and body representations during and\nfollowing tool-use.\nIt is unlikely that the lack of an effect of pain can be attributed to failure of our protocols to\ninduce updating in peripersonal space and body representation. For reaction times from the\nCCT, we found that reaction times to vibrotactile targets were slower when accompanied by\nvisual distractors in the same visual field compared to the opposite, but this effect was weaker\nwhen tools were crossed such that the opposite side visual distractors appeared on the same\ntools as the vibrotactile targets. These findings are comparable to the results reported by Mara-\nvita and colleagues [52]. We also found that estimates of the felt distance between two points\n(TDJs) parallel to the axis of the tool decreased in both arms after active tool-use. This is\nthought to reflect that the body representation has updated to incorporate the tools, and is con-\nsistent with previous findings (e.g.[54]). Our study thus replicated evidence of updating peri-\npersonal space and body representations during and after tool-use, but induced pain did not\nmodulate these effects.\nIt is also unlikely that the absence of a significant effect of pain on peripersonal space and\nbody representation in this study is due to failure of our sensory manipulations or compensa-\ntory changes in movements during pain induction. Participants reported experiencing pain\nthroughout the study in the pain condition and not for the two other conditions, indicating\nthat our pain induction was successful. We confirmed that movement patterns were similar\nfor all three conditions by having a condition-blind observer rate videos of participants’ move-\nments. We also found that mechanical pain threshold on the finger increased after the pain\ninduction to the arm, and this change in Mechanical Pain Threshold remained until the end of\nthe study. This demonstrates that our manipulation altered sensory processing relevant to the\nhand. However, mechanical detection thresholds remained unchanged, indicating that the\nability to detect a tactile stimulation was the same across sensory conditions. Therefore, our\nmanipulation succeeded in inducing pain, without impairing movement or tactile sensation,\nand so it is unlikely that our results can be attributed to methodological limitations.\nBodily and spatial representations can be influenced by pain. Previous work has demon-\nstrated that spatial perception can be modified by experimentally induced pain. For instance,\nthe subjective body midline deviated towards a painful thermal stimulation with a large magni-\ntude of effect [50], and painful cooling can increase the felt size of the thumb [51]. Our results,\nhowever, did not show any immediate effect of pain on body and peripersonal space representa-\ntions. Furthermore, they suggest that briefly-experienced acute pain does not alter the flexibility\nof such representations to update as a result of interaction with objects in our environment (e.g.\nduring tool-use). We can only speculate as to what effect a longer pain duration would have on\nrepresentations of the body and peripersonal space (i.e. beyond the ~1 hour of pain induced in\nour experiment), and what differences that might exist between acute and chronic pain. None-\ntheless, the outcomes of the current work have ramifications for how we might conceptualise\nthe maintained distortions in body and peripersonal space representations in people with\nchronic pain. Specifically, our findings could suggest that pain might not be the driving factor\npreventing normal body representation and peripersonal space from being restored. Therefore,\nfuture research should explore whether the plasticity of such representations could be preserved\nin people with chronic pain, despite their experience of distorted representations of the body\nand its surrounding space.\nAn alternative perspective on our results from the CCT, showing no effect of pain, might be\noffered by the distinction between goal-directed and defensive dimensions of peripersonal\nspace, as proposed by De Vignemont and Iannetti [12]. They conceptualise goal-directed peri-\npersonal space as the space upon which we can act, and defensive peripersonal space as the\nspace in which we might have to react to incoming, and potentially harmful, objects. Research\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 14 / 21\ninto tool-use largely covers goal-directed movements and tasks, and so Vignemont and Ian-\nnetti [12] speculated that defensive space would not be modulated by tool-use. It could be that\nthe painful stimulation used in our study altered properties of defensive peripersonal space,\nwhereas our task measured changes in goal-directed peripersonal space representations.\nAlthough they serve separate functions, there is evidence to suggest that goal-directed and\ndefensive peripersonal space representations can interact. Rossetti and colleagues [75] showed\nthat incoming painful stimuli, in this case a 4 cm long medical needle, presented both at 20\nand 40 cm away from the body triggered an alerting response (as measured by skin conduc-\ntance response) in healthy participants, but only after active use of a 40 cm tool. This shows\nthat tool-use can modulate a response to an incoming painful stimulus. Our study, however,\nshows that acute pain does not alter the updating of goal-directed peripersonal space. More\nresearch is needed to characterise how goal-directed and defensive peripersonal space repre-\nsentations interact, and how different qualities of pain might influence such interactions. For\ninstance, it could be that acute pain alters defensive peripersonal space in healthy individuals,\nas is the case in in people with trigeminal neuralgia [76], or that modifications of defensive\nperipersonal space are limited to approaching painful stimuli (i.e. when there is the potential\nthreat of pain).\nAlthough our findings were qualitatively similar to Maravita and colleagues [52] in that we\nfound overall less interference from opposite-side distractors when the tools were crossed\ncompared to uncrossed, these differences were less pronounced in our study. This was despite\nthe fact that we included additional interactive tool-use (beanbag sorting) tasks between the\nthree active sets of the CCT task. We also did not replicate the expected effect of active tool-use\non performance on the CCT over time. That is, we did not find that interference effects\nthought to reflect expansion of peripersonal space increased over time. Instead, we observed a\ndecrease in this pattern as participants spent more time interacting with the tool. Furthermore,\nwe found that participants showed interference effects consistent with expansion of periperso-\nnal space during passive interaction with the tools. It is unclear why our results differ from\nthose reported by Maravita and colleagues [52]. Although our CCT task replicated that of their\nstudy in most respects, a key difference is that we asked participants to indicate the location of\nthe vibrotactile targets using a four-alternative forced choice response (the factorial combina-\ntion of up-down and left-right). Maravita and colleges [52] used a two-alternate forced choice\nresponse in which participants indicated only the up-down location of the vibrotactile stimuli\nregardless of the side of space upon which they were presented. We used the four-alternative\nforced-choice response because we sought to disentangle limb-specific effects of unilateral\npain induction. That is, if we had found that pain interfered with updating of peripersonal\nspace and body representations, we aimed to explore whether this interference was restricted\nto the side of the painful arm, or if pain disrupted these processes more generally. It is possible\nthat our four-alternative forced-choice response added an additional level of spatial incongru-\nence that prevented the emergence of a stronger effect of tool-use in this task, as the crossmo-\ndal congruency effect is driven by the reaction time cost that arises from presenting visual\ndistractors at spatially incongruent locations to tactile targets [77]. For example, in our study\nspatial incongruence could be created when the tools were crossed and the distractor origi-\nnated on the same tool and in the same vertical location as the vibrotactile target (i.e. the dis-\ntractor and target are in opposite visual fields). In the study of Maravita and colleagues [52],\nhowever, no such spatial incongruence would have been present in such a trial with regards to\nthe response required (up or down), thus making object-based effects easier to interpret. This\nmight explain why we found an overall pattern that was comparable to Maravita and col-\nleagues, indicative of peripersonal space updating, although the effect was less pronounced.\nUpdating peripersona l space and body represent ations during pain induction\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.02100 45 May 16, 2019 15 / 21\nFuture studies should limit themselves to one level of spatial incongruence (e.g. up/down\nresponses only).\nTo our knowledge, this was the first study testing changes in TDJs in both arms (rather\nthan just one) following tool-use. This was partly enabled by using a simplified version of the\ntask. Unlike previous studies (e.g. [17, 56, 78]), our TDJ task did not have a reference stimula-\ntion (typically administered to the forehead), and included fewer trials (we used one instead of\nat least eight trials per stimulated distance [54]). This could be the reason why we found a\nsmaller effect of tool-use on TDJs than has previously been reported. Nonetheless, we still\ndetected the well-characterised effect of tool-use on body representation using this simplified\nTDJ task. Previous studies using the conventional TDJ task to investigate tool-use have tested\nonly one arm. However, it is conceivable that there could be differences in how body represen-\ntation is updated in the two arms after tool-use, for example due to differences in activity levels\nbetween arms (e.g. [78]), or in our case, due to one arm being painful. For instance, judge-\nments about the felt distance between two stimuli are less accurate when they are nociceptive\n[79] compared to tactile (i.e. a TDJ). However, our results showed no difference between the\nchange in TDJs for the two arms, and that the experience of pain itself does not alter such\njudgements.\nTo conclude, we sought to investigate the effect of induced pain on the updating of periper-\nsonal space and body representations during and following tool-use. Our study replicated find-\nings showing that active tool-use updated peripersonal space and body representations. We\nalso successfully induced pain, without impairing movement or tactile sensitivity. However,\nwe found evidence that induced pain did not interfere with updating peripersonal space and\nbody representations. When considered with previous results, these results suggest that\ninduced pain can cause a direct change in bodily and spatial perception, but the mechanisms\ninvolved in updating such representations do not appear to be disrupted. This suggests that\nany disruption to these processes in pathological pain conditions cannot be sufficiently\nexplained by acute pain.\nSupporting information\nS1 Fig. Example tool arrangement.
