  "abstract": "Objective The objective of the current study was to assess the quality of large language model (LLM) chatbot versus physician‐generated responses to patient‐generated rheumatology questions. Methods We conducted a single‐center cross‐sectional survey of rheumatology patients (n = 17) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Patients evaluated LLM chatbot versus physician‐generated responses for comprehensiveness and readability, with four rheumatologists also evaluating accuracy by using a Likert scale from 1 to 10 (1 being poor, 10 being excellent). Results Patients rated no significant difference between artificial intelligence (AI) and physician‐generated responses in comprehensiveness (mean 7.12 ± SD 0.99 vs 7.52 ± 1.16; P = 0.1962) or readability (7.90 ± 0.90 vs 7.80 ± 0.75; P = 0.5905). Rheumatologists rated AI responses significantly poorer than physician responses on comprehensiveness (AI 5.52 ± 2.13 vs physician 8.76 ± 1.07; P &lt; 0.0001), readability (AI 7.85 ± 0.92 vs physician 8.75 ± 0.57; P = 0.0003), and accuracy (AI 6.48 ± 2.07 vs physician 9.08 ± 0.64; P &lt; 0.0001). The proportion of preference to AI‐ versus physician‐generated responses by patients and physicians was 0.45 ± 0.18 and 0.15 ± 0.08, respectively ( P = 0.0106). After learning that one answer for each question was AI generated, patients were able to correctly identify AI‐generated answers at a lower proportion compared to physicians (0.49 ± 0.26 vs 0.97 ± 0.04; P = 0.0183). The average word count of AI answers was 69.10 ± 25.35 words, as compared to 98.83 ± 34.58 words for physician‐generated responses ( P = 0.0008). Conclusion Rheumatology patients rated AI‐generated responses to patient questions similarly to physician‐generated responses in terms of comprehensiveness, readability, and overall preference. However, rheumatologists rated AI responses significantly poorer than physician‐generated responses, suggesting that LLM chatbot responses are inferior to physician responses, a difference that patients may not be aware of. image",
