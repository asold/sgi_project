As the size, complexity, and accessibility of EMRs grow, the ability to\nextract meaningful information from them has become an increasingly important problem to solve.\nMethods: We develop a standardized data analysis process to support cohort study with a focus on a particular\ndisease. We use an interactive divide-and-conquer approach to classify patients into relatively uniform within each\ngroup. It is a repetitive process enabling the user to divide the data into homogeneous subsets that can be visually\nexamined, compared, and refined. The final visualization was driven by the transformed data, and user feedback\ndirect to the corresponding operators which completed the repetitive process. The output results are shown in a\nSankey diagram-style timeline, which is a particular kind of flow diagram for showing factors ’ states and transitions\nover time.\nResults: This paper presented a visually rich, interactive web-based application, which could enable researchers to\nstudy any cohorts over time by using EMR data. The resulting visualizations help uncover hidden information in the\ndata, compare differences between patient groups, determine critical factors that influence a particular disease, and\nhelp direct further analyses. We introduced and demonstrated this tool by using EMRs of 14,567 Chronic Kidney\nDisease (CKD) patients.\nConclusions: We developed a visual mining system to support exploratory data analysis of multi-dimensional\ncategorical EMR data. By using CKD as a model of disease, it was assembled by automated correlational analysis\nand human-curated visual evaluation. The visualization methods such as Sankey diagram can reveal useful\nknowledge about the particular disease cohort and the trajectories of the disease over time.\nBackground\nElectronic medical records (EMRs) are now widespread\nand collecting vast amounts of data about patients and\nmetadata about how healthcare is delivered. These small\ndatacenters have the potential to enable a range of\nhealth quality improvements that would not be possible\nwith paper-based records [1]. However, the large amounts\nof data inside EMRs come with one large problem: how to\ncondense the data so that is easily understandable to a\nhuman. The volume, variety a nd veracity of clinical data\npresent a real challenge for non-technical users such as\nphysicians and researchers who wish to view the data.\nWithout a way to quickly summarize the data in a\nhuman-understandable way, the insights contained within\nEMRs will remain locked inside.\nMany EMRs are also not flexible enough to accommo-\ndate the information needs of different types of users. For\ninstance, clinicians often try to combine data from different\ninformation systems in order to piece together an accurate\ncontext for the medical problems of the patient who is in\n* Correspondence: ma@cs.ucdavis.edu; jaak88@gmail.com; jj@tmu.edu.tw\n† Equal contributors\n4Department of Computer Science, University of California-Davis, Davis, CA,\nUSA\n1Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medical Science and\nTechnology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan\n2International Center for Health Information Technology (ICHIT), Taipei\nMedical University, Taipei, Taiwan\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2015 Huang et al.

Clinical researchers, however, may be\nprimarily interested in finding population level outcomes or\ndifferences between cohorts. Administrators use EMR data\nto inform healthcare policy, while patients who use EMRs\nmay be interested in comparing their health to their peers\nor tracking their own health over time [2]. Unfortunately,\nlittle support exists in current EMR systems for any of these\ncommon use cases, which hampers informed decision-\nmaking.\nVisual analytics, also known as data visualization,\nholds the potential to address the information overload\nthat is becoming more and more prevalent. Visual ana-\nlytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated\nby advanced interactive visual interfaces [3, 4]. It can\nplay a fundamental role in all IT-enabled healthcare\ntransformation but particularly in healthcare delivery\nprocess improvement. Interactive visual approaches are\nvaluable as they move beyond traditional static reports\nand indicators to mapping, exploration, discovery, and\nsense-making of complex data. Visual analytics techniques\ncombine concepts from data mining, machine learning,\nhuman computing interaction, and human cognition. In\nhealthcare, data visualization has already been used in the\nareas of patient education, symptom evolution, patient\ncohort analysis, EHR data and design, and patient care\nplans. This enables decision makers to obtain ideas for\ncare process data, see patterns, spot trends, and identify\noutliers, all of which aid user comprehension, memory,\nand decision making [5].\nOur objective is to create a visually interactive exploratory\ndata analysis tool that can be used to graphically show\ndisease-disease associations over time. That is, the tool\npresents how a cohort of patien ts with one chronic disease\nm a yg oo nt od e v e l o po t h e rd i s e a s e so v e rt i m e .T h es t u d y\nused chronic kidney disease (CKD) as the prototype\nchronic disease, users could e asily change the software tool\nto visualize a different disease. In the previous study, we\nhave verified that such a system can significantly raise the\nefficiency and performance of practicing physicians and\nclinical researchers who desire to use EMRs for their\nresearch projects [6, 7]. Expected cohort trajectories are of\ngreat interest in clinical research. Our main task, then, will\nbe to identify underlying chro nic diseases and explore what\nhappens over time to the being diagnosed patients and\nwhat comorbidities they develop over time.\nMethods\nSystem design\nThe system is designed based on data transformations\nthat are required to perform longitudinal cohort studies.\nThe transformed data are connected by a sequence of\nadjustable operators. The output results are shown in a\nSankey diagram–style timeline, which is a particular kind of\nflow diagram for showing factors’states and transitions over\ntime. The visualization is driven by the transformed data,\nand the user feedback is directed to the corresponding\noperators, and completing the iterative process.\nData transformation\nThe data transformation steps behind the visual analysis\nprocess are illustrated in Fig. 1. The transformation\norder follows the analysis process from raw patient\nrecords to the final visualization. Assume that there are\nN patients and M unique factors. As the top-most chart\nshows, the raw sequence of a patient can be treated as a\ndiscrete trajectory with non-uniformly distributed records\nalong the time axis. We define the patient trajectories as\nP={ p1, … , pn, … , pN} and the set of factors as F = { f1, … , fm,\n… , fM}. A patient trajectory is an ordered sequence of Kn\nrecords: pn ¼ rn;1… ; rn;k ; … ; rn;kn\n/C0/C1\n, where each record\nconsists of a factor set and a timestamp: rn,k =( Fn,k, tn,k),\nFn,k ⊂ F. Note the timestamp of each record is relative and\nnot necessarily the actual record date. In the cohort study,\nwe are interested in the temporal and populational\npatterns on the course of CKD. Therefore, it makes more\nsense to align each patient trajectory by their days before\nand after being diagnosed with CKD.\nWhen the user specifies the time windows: T = ( t1, … , tl,\n… , tL), the patient trajectories are partitioned based on their\nt i m e s t a m p s .R e c o r d si nt h es a m et i m ew i n d o wa r em e r g e d\ninto one:\nr0\nn;l ¼ F0\nn;l; tl\n/C16/C17\nF0\nn;l ¼ ∪\ni∈I\nFn;i\nΙ ¼ kjtl≤tn;k < tlþ1\n/C8/C9\nThe end results are patient trajectories regulated in\ntime, P0\nn ¼ r0\nn;1; … ; r\n0\nn;l; … ; r0\nn;Ln\n/C16/C17\n, where the timestamps\nare regulated by the time windows, and each record ’s\nfactor set represents all the factors observed on that\npatient within the time window. When the user requests\nfor patient clustering, the patients at each time window\nare clustered based on a certain similarity measure and\nbecome a set of cohorts: Cl ¼ cl;1;… ; cl;h; … ; cl;Hl\n/C8/C9\n,\nwhere Cl ⊂ Ρ and it represents a set of Hi cohorts at time\nwindow tl.\nWe define the cohort trajectory network as G =( V, E),\nwhere each node V =( vl,h|vl,h = cl,h) represents a cohort\nat a time window, and each edge Ε ={ el,i,j|vl,i →vl +\n1,j,| cl,i ∩ cl,j| > 0} represents the association between two\ncohorts at consecutive time windows where their mem-\nbers overlap. The network G is used to drive the\nvisualization in the end of the process.\nHuang et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making  (2015) 15:92 Page 2 of 14\nData & control flow\nAs shown in Fig. 2, data flows through a sequence of opera-\ntors, which are adjustable and associated with different in-\nteractions by the user. The int eraction workflow is designed\nfrom the user’s point of view, and it implements.\nOnce the user specifies the important factors for the\nstudy, the system scans the raw patient trajectories record\nby record, filters, and aggregates the factors accordingly.\nSimilarly, the time windows defined by the user also\nchanges the way the system partitions and aggregates the\ntrajectories over time. The two operators, cluster nodes and\nfilter edges, implement multi ple techniques to support the\nanalysis tasks of finding cohort and filtering associations,\nrespectively. It is important to note that there is no once-\nFig. 1 Data transformation processes.

Each cluster\nor filter operator has its strengths and its limitations,\nt h e s ea r et h er e a s o n sw h yw es h o u l db ec a r e f u l l y\nemployed.\n(1) Frequency-based Cohort Clustering: Frequency-\nbased clustering allows one to follow one ’s basic intuition\nto see the “main idea ” of data. Cohorts with higher\ncardinalities are preserved while minor ones are consid-\nered less important and merged. Our system allows the\nuser to specify a threshold x for the cardinality, and it\nmerges cohorts of sizes less than the threshold into the\n“others” group.\ncluster C lðÞ ¼ cl;h if c l;h\n/C12/C12 /C12/C12 ≥x\nothers if c l;h\n/C12/C12 /C12/C12 < x\n/C26\n(2) Hierarchical Cohort Clustering: Given a time window,\neach patient is characterized by the comorbidity of factors\nwithin the window. We consider the similarity between two\nunique comorbidities as the se t relation of their factors. For\nexample, two sets of factors { f1}a n d{ f1, f2} are partially\noverlapped by the common factor f1. In consideration of\nsuch similarity, we apply hierarchical clustering to extract\ncohorts with similar comorbidities.\nFig. 2 The data and control flow of visual analysis process from user perspective. The data flows through a sequence of operators, which were\nadjustable and associated with different interactions by the user\nHuang et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making  (2015) 15:92 Page 4 of 14\nThe resulting clusters are hierarchical and the user can\nspecify the desired number of clusters. With more clusters\none is able to describe the characteristics of each cohort\nmore accurately, but more clusters introduce more nodes,\nmore associations, and thus higher visual complexity. On\nthe other hand, fewer clusters create less visual complexity\nat the expense of potentially overlooking some essential\nbut smaller structures.\nGiven the set of factors: si = F ' i,l a tat i m ew i n d o wtl for a\npatient pi, we define the similarity between two patients\nwith the Ochiai coefficient [8], which is a variation of cosine\nsimilarity between sets:\nsimilarity ¼ s1∩s2jjﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\ns1jj s2jj\np\n(3) Variance-based Association Filtering: The import-\nance of an association lies in how confident we are able to\nmake an inference from it. We can extract the statistically\nimportant associations by ranking and filtering their\nvariances. Our system demonstrates this capability by\nadopting one particular type of variance, which is defined\nas the outcome entropy of the associated cohort. Such\nentropy can be calculated by the conditional probabilities\nof the different outcomes of the given cohort:\npb p ∈clþ1;jjp∈cl;i\n/C0/C1\n¼ pb c lþ1;jjcl;i\n/C0/C1\n¼ cl;i∩clþ1;j\n/C12/C12 /C12/C12\ncl;i\n/C12/C12 /C12/C12\nentropy e l;i;j\n/C0/C1\n¼ −\nX\nk\npb c lþ1;k jcl;i\n/C0/C1\n/C3 pb c lþ1;k jcl;i\n/C0/C1/C0/C1\nWe can see that the entropy is minimized when the\npatients in a cohort at the current time window all go to\nanother cohort at the next window. In contrast, it is\nmaximized when the probabilities of patients who go to\nother cohorts are uniformly distributed. Our system\nallows filtering important associations by adjusting the\nentropy threshold. When the threshold is high, all\nassociations are shown in spite of their variance; in the\nextreme case when the threshold is zero, only the associ-\nations of zero entropy will be displayed; in other words,\nit only visualizes the associations between fully over-\nlapped cohorts.\nVisualization design\nOur system visualizes the cohort trajectories network\nmodel that we discussed in the previous section and\nsummarizes it. The user can use it to assess important\nfeatures such as cohort comorbidity, cohort distributions,\nand their associations across time windows, etc. We\ndesign the visual encoding and the optimization strategies\nin a way to maximize the legibility of the presentation.\n(1) Visual Encoding: We encode the dimensions of the\nvisual space similarly to OutFl ow, where the x-axis encodes\nthe time information and the y-axis is used for laying out\nthe categories (comorbidities) [9]. We also visualize the\nassociations between the cohorts as ribbons.\nThe visualization must convey the characteristics of\nboth the cohorts and the associations. It is common to\nencode cardinality to the nodes and edges [10, 11] as such\ninformation allows the user to assess the frequency-based\ndistribution. Our system encodes cardinality as the nodes ’\nor edges’height. Each cohort is labeled to show its domin-\nant characteristics. It lists the common factors shared by\nall patients in this group. If there are factors not shared by\nthe entire group, we indicate it by appending an asterisk\nto the label. In addition, we map colors to unique comor-\nbidities and assign each node its corresponding color. The\nedge color is determined by the two nodes it connects,\nand we use gradients for smooth transitions.\nThe visual encoding of our system is tailored for the\nCKD cohort study; however, it can be easily changed to\ndisplay other relevant information. For example, instead\nof showing the cardinality, the edge can encode other\nstatistical measurements that reveal set relations [12].\n(2) Optimization: The overlap between cohorts could be\ncomplex and thus increase the number of edges as well as\nthe number of edge crossings. I t could impact the legibility\nof the visualization. Since the y-axis is nominal and the\nordering between the categories is flexible, we can arrange\nthe node ’s vertical positions to reduce the amount of\ncrisscrossing and thus resolve visual clutter.\nThe algorithm we apply to minimize edge crossing is\nmodified from an existing library and is a heuristic itera-\ntive relaxation method [13]. The algorithm sweeps back\nand forth along the x-axis and adjusts the node vertical\npositions based on two objectives: (1) minimize the edge\nlength, and (2) resolve node overlaps. It utilizes simulated\nannealing, so the process ends in a predictable time. The\nresult is an approximation but the algorithm allows us to\nget reasonable results in an interactive rate.\nIn addition, the z-ordering (front to back of the screen)\nof the edges should be considered as well in order to\nmaximize legibility [11]. We choose to place smaller edges\non top of the larger ones to reveal the outliers.\nInteraction methods\nThe system interface consists of two views: trajectory\nview and summary view. The trajectory view is time-\nbased and displays an overview of patient trajectories\nthat the user can interact directly with. It also high-\nlights the trajectories of selected patients. Summary\nview presents the characteristics of the selected patient\ngroup. For example, it shows the distributions of\ngender, age, and factors, etc. It is also interactive and\nprovides additional functions such as querying by\npatient metadata information.\nHuang et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making  (2015) 15:92 Page 5 of 14\nMost data items (patients, factors, etc.) in the system\nare selectable, and the syst em automatically searches\nfor related items and highlights such associations with\nvisual links. For example, the user can select a cluster\nof patients by clicking on a node or an edge in the\ntrajectory view. The patients selected are highlighted\nas red regions in each node and link. The highlighted\nregions also encode the ca rdinality as heights so it\nshows the proportion of the patients selected compar-\ning to others. In the meantime, the highlighted edges\nreveal the paths traveled by the selected patients. In\naddition, the user can also select a factor, and all\npatients having this factor will be highlighted. This\nenables the user to observe the global distribution of a\nparticular factor.\nPilot study\nData sources\nThe original data source for this paper is from Taiwan ’s\nNational Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD),\na longitudinal database which contains International\nClassification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifi-\ncation (ICD-9-CM) codes for disease identification as\nwell as procedure codes. The database contains health\ninformation for one million people over 13 years\n(1998– 2011). We extracted 14,567 CKD patients who\nhad eleven common comorbidities.\nPreparing to visualize clinical data involves a series of\nlogical steps [4, 14]. The first step in the data visualization\nprocess is selecting the patie nt cohorts. Figure 3 shows the\nvisualization with only 17 observed factors. The x-axis\nFig. 3 Time course of 14,567 CKD patients clustered by comorbidities. 14,567 CKD patients clustered according to comorbidities on the timeline.\nThe x-axis showed the timeline covering 12 years before and after each patient who got a diagnosis of CKD, while the y-axis presents the clusters\nof trajectories for each CKD patient\nHuang et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making  (2015) 15:92 Page 6 of 14\nshows the patients’conditions over the timeline before and\nafter getting CKD diagnosis; the y-axis presents the\narrangement of trajectories for each CKD patient, which\nthey were aggregated togeth er with the same comorbidity\nclusters. However, the outcome of visualization was too\ndifficult to interpret and understand. The tool would be\nmore useful for users if we could provide selection and\naggregation function to ass ociate their target patient\ngroups.\nAnother challenge in the cohort identification process\nis to standardize the large diversity and inhomogeneity\nof comorbidities in the database [4]. Due to those high-\ndimensional data, such as electronic medical records,\nwould lower the homogeneity between data items, we\nused a divide-and-conquer approach to classify patients\ninto relatively uniform within each groups. Figure 4\nshows an overview of this process.\nFactors\nA factor is a general term used to describe a single\ncriterion that is used to separate patients into cohorts.\nThe factors are derived from diseases and procedures\nand are the fundamental elements that characterize a\npatient in our system. In the CKD cohort study, there\nare tens of thousands diseases and procedure codes that\none could use to separate CKD patients. Defining the\nright set of factors is not a trivial task because including un-\nnecessary factors that are eith er redundant or irrelevant to\nthe analysis objectives increases the computational cost as\nwell as jeopardizes the interpre tability of the visualization.\nOur system is flexible enough to allow the user to define a\nset of factors by selecting independent ICD-9 codes or\naggregating correlated ones based on the user ’sd o m a i n\nknowledge. In this study, we worked with nephrologists to\ndefine 17 related criteria that users can visually explore\nconcerning chronic kidney disease (Table 1). The 17 factors\nrepresent the most related diseases and procedures that\nfollow a diagnosis CKD.\nTime windows\nVisualizing EMR data over time also requires the ability to\nchange the granularity of the x-axis (time). For example,\nin CKD there are several stages in its natural history.\nWithin each stage, CKD can be relatively stable, but there\nis inhomogeneity between CKD patients at different\nstages. Therefore, we use time windows to refer the time\nduration or interval (i.e., 1-month, 1-year, 2-year … etc.) To\ndecide on a time granularity is a manual process that is\noften best judged by humans [3]. The results are patient\ntrajectories partitioned over time, which accentuates the\ndifferences between cohorts.\nPatient groups\nWhile patient comorbidities within each time window\nare expected to be stable, comorbidities are not stable\nover the entire population across all time windows.\nOur system handles this pr oblem by using clustering\nmethods which make clear th e underlying comorbidity\ndistributions within each patient group. The end results are\ncohorts that have reliable distributions of comorbidities.\nVisual examination\nO n c et h et i m ew i n d o w sa r edefined and the cohorts are\nextracted, the quality of the vi sualization can be evaluated\nby examining the associations between cohorts. For\ninstance, the user might want to examine how cohorts\nmerge or diverge over time. Our system reveals not just\nassociations that would otherwise be impossible a\nperson to notice, but also allows users to interact with\nthe underlying data immediately to facilitate “what-if”\nscenarios. Sometimes, however, the quantity or variance\nof the associations could be large and thus lead to\nvisual clutter problems. Therefore, our system also\nallows the user to rank and filter the associations based\non their statistical importance. This way, the user can\nlimit themselves to exploring visual changes that are\nalso in fact statistically significant both visually and\nmathematically. At any step of the visual analysis\nprocess, the user can go back and change the settings\nfor factors, time windows, patient clustering, and\ncomorbidity association filtering. For example, if the\nuser wants to explore the temporal patterns in finer\ndetail and examine if there are local and short-term\npatterns, the user can add more time windows to the\ncontext; on the other hand, if two or more stages\nexhibit indistinguishable pa tterns, the user might want\nto merge those time windows as they do not convey\nextra information. The user can also change the\nFig. 4 Classifying patients into uniform cohorts. The flow showed an overview of the data analysis process in this study. The visual analysis\nprocess was based on CKD research dataset\nHuang et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making  (2015) 15:92 Page 7 of 14\nparameters to refine how patients are grouped or how asso-\nciations are filtered. This itera tive process continues until\nthe user obtain a result that he/she is satisfied with.\nWe use the CKD as a model chronic disease to demon-\nstrate the analysis process, but the process can be applied\nto the study of other diseases as well. For example, if the\nuser wants to study the clinical trajectories of diabetics,\nthe user can define a list of factors related to diabetes.\nThen the user can apply the same process to set up time\nwindows, cluster patients, and explore cohort trajectories.\nEthical approval\nThis type of study was not required the Institutional Review\nBoard review in accordance with the policy of National\nHealth Research Institutes which provides the large com-\nputerized de-identified data (http://nhird.nhri.org.tw/en/).\nResults\nExploring cohort structures\nIn this study, we build an exploratory data analysis tool\nthat depicts the trajectories of 14,567 CKD patients ’\ncomorbidities over time. We partition the records into\nmultiple 2-year time windows. Researchers often have\ndifferent factors-of-interest for different windows of CKD.\nIn the pre-CKD stage, they are interested in common\ndiseases such as hypertension, diabetes; for end-stage CKD\nfactors, they are interested in critical procedures such as\ndialysis, renal transplantation, or patient death. We filter\nthe factors of interest according to each time window.\nSince there are too many comorbidities to visualize\nclearly as shown in Fig. 3, we apply frequency-based cohort\nclustering to extract the dominant cohorts. As Fig. 5 shows,\nthe trajectories are simplified where larger cohorts are kept\nand smaller ones are merged into a single “others” group\n(light green for others without CKD and light orange for\nothers with CKD). From the overviews, we can learn about\nthe prevalence of different comorbidities and their propor-\ntions in the population. For example, we can see from Fig. 5\nthat the number of patients with a single disease such as\nhypertension (HTN) (brown) and diabetes (DM) (dark\nblue) shrinks as the time approaches year 0, which means\nthat patients start to exhibit other diseases. The user can\nlower the threshold to reveal smaller sized cohorts as\ns h o w ni nF i g .6 .\nExploring associated relationships\nAnother goal of exploratory data analysis is to uncover\nunexpected associations between two variables. In this\nstudy, we demonstrate the expl oring associations between\nhemodialysis (HD) in early stages of CKD and other\ndiseases and procedures. More specifically, we want to\nidentify the driving factors that may lead to hemodialysis\nand the downstream consequences.\nFirst, we divide CKD patients according to CKD\nseverity: (1) pre-CKD: before the patient ’sf i r s tC K D\ndiagnosis, (2) first year-of-CKD, and (3) post-CKD: a\nyear after the patient ’s first CKD diagnosis. Second, we\nfilter CKD patients according to pre-determined\ncriteria that nephrologists determined to be clinically\nimportant. For the first-year-of-CKD stage, we focus\non which patients will go on to require hemodialysis;\nfor the post-CKD stage, we watch other common\ndiseases and procedures related to CKD patients:\nDeath, peritoneal dialysis (PD), and renal transplant\n(RTPL); for the pre-CKD stage, we watch all 17\ndiseases/procedures. As a result, there are 835 unique\nTable 1 Factor association rules\nDiseases / Procedures (Abbreviation) ICD-9 / Procedure code\nCerebrovascular Disease(CVD) 430 – 438\nChronic Kidney Disease(CKD) 585, 586\nCongestive Heart Failure(CHF) 398.91, 402, 404, 425.4-425.9,428\nCoronary Artery Disease(CAD) 410 – 414\nDiabetes mellitus(DM) 250\nGlomerulonephritis(GN) 582\nHemodialysis(HD) 58001C,58019C,58020C,58021C,58022C,58023C,58024C,58025C,58027C,58029C,58030B\nHyperlipidemia 272\nHypertension(HTN) 401\nPeritoneal Dialysis(PD) 58002C,58009B,58010B,58011C,58012B,58017C,58028C\nPolycystic Kidney Disease(PKD) 75312\nProteinuria 791\nRenal stone 592\nRenal transplantation(RTPL) V420\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus(SLE) 7100\nHuang et al.

However,\nthere are too many combinations at the pre-CKD stage to\nbe visualized directly. For simplicity, we first group them\ninto one single cluster and focus on the last two time\nwindows. As Fig. 7a shows, we find that 70.2 % of the\npatients who took hemodialysis in the first year of CKD did\nnot develop any other diseases or procedures related to\nCKD, while the rest of them eit her required peritoneal (PD)\nor renal transplantation (RTPL), or died. Some of the\npatients who were not on hemodialysis in the first year also\ndied; however, the mortality rate seems lower. We also\nnotice that more than half of the patients who didn ’t\nrequire hemodialysis in the first year are not associated with\nany of post-CKD factors of interest. This means they were\neither in stable condition after the first year or their follow-\ning treatments were not recorded.\nTo see stronger associations between the pre-CKD\nfactors and HD during the first-year-of-CKD stage, we must\nfilter out the associations that are not helpful. For example,\nif a group of similar patient s are associated with both\n“CKD” and “CKD|HD” clusters, it’s hard to tell whether this\ncombination of factors will lead to hemodialysis or not. We\ncan rule out all those unconfident associations by filtering\naccording to the variance of their associations. We set a\nstrict threshold 0.0 for the va riance so that the association\nis kept only when it is 100 % confident. After the filtering,\n32.6 % of the 835 unique combinations are taken out\nbecause their associations with the first-year-of-CKD stage\nare not confident. Figure 7b shows that the remaining asso-\nciations only covers 17.4 % of the population. This means\nthe pre-defined 17 factors m ight not be good explanatory\nvariables to discriminate patients taking or not taking\nhemodialysis in the first year of CKD.\nNext, we perform hierarchical clustering on the patients\nat the pre-CKD stage and generate ten groups of similar\npatients, as shown in Fig. 7c. Note there are three groups\nlabeled “*”, which seems confusing at first as they could\nFig. 5 Frequency-based Cohort Clustering:Sankey Diagrams for CKD Cohort Sizes of < 250. The traject ories were simplified where larger cohorts were kept\nand smaller ones were merged into a single “others” group. The light green for others without CKD and light orange for others with CKD\nHuang et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making  (2015) 15:92 Page 9 of 14\nhave been merged into one group. In fact, the three groups\nhave different factor distri butions. They are labeled “*”\nbecause none of the groups have a common factor shared\nby all members in the group. To avoid confusion, the user\ncan assign a custom label to describe the nature of the\ngroup. When we select and highlight the group who has a\ncommon factor of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we\nfind that none of them required more serious procedures\nsuch as renal transplantation or died. Figure 7d is a zoom-\nin view showing the structure of the selected “SLE,*”\ngroup. We also notice that the proportion of patients\nrequiring hemodialysis in the first year of CKD in the\n“SLE,*” group (3.14 %) is one-third of the proportion in\nthe entire population (9.54 %).\nResponsiveness\nOur system is a web-based (http:/ /sankey.ic-hit.net/) and is\ntested with a commodity desktop machine (CPU: 2.66 GHz\nQuad-Core, Memory: 8GB 1066 MHz DDR3) as the appli-\ncation server and another desktop machine as the client.\nMost of the back end programs are written in Python, and\nthe front end programs are written in Javascript and\nHTML5.\nThe system caches the transformed data after each\noperation in the data control flow (as shown in Fig. 2) to\nreduce unnecessary processing time and improve user\nend responsiveness. There are four major types of user\ninteractions: defining factors, partitioning time windows,\nmerging patients and filtering associations. The first two\ninteractions usually happen at the beginning of a study\nand occasionally happen in major revisions. On the\nother hand, the rest of two interaction types are much\nmore frequent in the analysis process. Caching the less\nfrequently updating results helps us reduce unnecessary\nprocessing time.\nWe measure the time elapsed for each process using the\nsystem timer. For 14,567 patients and 6,031,579 records, it\ntakes 6 min to filter and aggregate factors of the entire data\nset, and 25 s to partition the data set into three time\nwindows. However, such operations are taken only a few\ntimes throughout the analys is and thus do not require\nimmediate response. More frequently performed operations\nFig. 6 The system visualization displayed with the threshold adjust to 150. The user could enlarge/lower the threshold to reveal different size of cohorts\nHuang et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making  (2015) 15:92 Page 10 of 14\nsuch as clustering patients or filtering associations only take\n5 s per time window on average.\nDiscussion\nWe present a system to visually analyze the comorbidities\nassociated with CKD by using a large-scale database\ncontaining 14,567 patients. We visualize the results using a\nSankey diagram to help practic ing physicians and clinical\nresearchers investigate the outcome of this complex disease\nbased on comorbidities or procedures that these patients\nhave.\nBuilding a visually interactive exploratory data ana-\nlysis tool is not without several challenges. First, direct\nvisualization of all the patients can easily lead to\noverplotting. Second, in this dataset, there exists tens of\nthousands of risk factors pert i n e n tt oC K Dp a t i e n t s .I ti s\nnot apparent how to best discriminate and visualize these\nfactors to bring out structures of interest in the data. After\nFig. 7 Explore causal relationship (12,960 patients). a There were 70.2 % of the patients who took HD in the first year of CKD did not develop any\nother factors, while the rest of them either took PD, RTPL, or died. b After filtering the unconfident associations, the remaining associations only\ncovers 17.4 % of the population. c To perform hierarchical clustering on the patients at the pre-CKD stage and generate ten groups of similar\npatients. d When we highlighted the group who had a common factor of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we found that none of them took\nthe more serious procedures such as renal transplantation or died. Note: There are three groups labelled “*” because of the groups have no\ncommon factor shared by all members in the group\nHuang et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making  (2015) 15:92 Page 11 of 14\nall, one of the main goals of data visualization is to bring\nout unexpected patterns in the data, which is best achieved\nby unsupervised machine learning methods. Figure 3 shows\nan unfiltered visualization of the CKD and 17 associated\ncomorbidities and procedures. You may find out that the\nvisualization is too complex to comprehend. It would be\nuseful to select, aggregate, and visualize factors associated\nwith patient groups. We have developed an interactive\nvisualization system to support such operations.\nTemporal visualization\nTime-series information are traditionally of particular\ninterest when analyzing EMRs. [15] Much prior work\nhas suggested presenting patient history longitudinally\n[16– 18]. Real world data usually has prohibitively high\nvisual complexity due to its high dimensionality or high\nvariance. Thus, several simplification methods have been\nproposed. Bui et al. suggested using folder as well as\nnon-linear spacing [19]. In the V-model project, Park et al.\ncompressed the causality relationship along a linear\ntimescale to an ordinal representation to carry more\ncontextual information of the event [20]. In addition to\nabstracting time to use the horizontal screen real estate\nmore efficiently, there are methods to save the vertical\nreal estate. Bade et al. implemented a level-of-detail\nt e c h n i q u et h a tp r e s e n t sd a t ai nf i v ed i f f e r e n tf o r m s\nbased on its source and the row height available [21].\nOur method simplifies the visual complexity of patient tra-\njectories by aggregating recor ds over time, clustering pa-\ntients and filtering associations between cohorts.\nQuery-based visual analytics\nIn many real world cases, the user can narrow down the\nscope and reduce the complexity of the data by querying\nbased on his or her domain knowledge. Systems of this\nkind allow the user to specify the pattern of interest and\ncan enhance the analytic process with advanced interfaces\n[22, 23]. However, it is not always easy to translate an\nanalysis task into proper queries [24]. For temporal event\nqueries, Wang et al. proposed an interactive system to\nsupport querying with higher level semantics such as\nprecursor, co-occurring, and aftereffect events [25]. Their\nsystem outputs visual-oriented summary information to\nshow the prevalence of the events as well as to allow\ncomparison between multiple groups of events [26]. For\noverview specific tasks, Wongsuphasawat et al. proposed\nLifeFlow, a novel visualization that simplifies and aggre-\ngates temporal event sequences into a tree-based visual\nsummary [27]. Monroe et al. improved the usability of the\nsystem by integrating interval-based events and develop-\ning a set of user-driven simplification techniques in\nconjunction with a metric for measuring visual complexity\n[13, 28]. Wongsuphasawat et al. also extended LifeFlow\ninto a Sankey diagram-based visualization, which reveals\nthe alternative paths of events and helps the user under-\nstand the evolution of patient symptoms and other related\nfactors [29]..\nIn spite of their effectiveness in guided or well-informed\nanalysis, query-based systems fall short for exploratory ana-\nlysis where the user may not have a well-defined hypothesis\nand simply wants to explore and learn the data.\nExploring inhomogeneous data\nHigh-dimensional data items are less homogeneous and\nharder to compare with each othe r. It is harder to associate,\nr a n k ,o rf i l t e rt h o s ei t e m sm e a n i n g f u l l y .S o m eh a v ep r o -\nposed that data be sliced and diced by dimension or item\nand separated into homogeneous subsets [4]. It has been\nproven that, by carefully selecting projection methods, a\nsystem can incorporate multi ple heterogeneous genetic\ndata and identify meaningful cl usters of patients [30]. Our\nwork is an example of the slice-and-dice concept, where we\npartition the record time in to multiple dimensions and\ngroup patients within each time window.\nWe would like to investigate the possibility of using\nmore sophisticated feature extraction methods in future\nwork. In this case, we define the factors by hand with\ndomain knowledge and group the patients based on the\nfactors by a simple set similarity metric or a frequency-\nbased metric. However, the combinations of factors are\nnoisy and the variance within each cluster are usually\nhigh. Furthermore, there are still thousands of unused\nfactors that may provide additional insights. Such problem\ncould potentially be addressed with the help of corres-\npondence analysis.\nMore optimizations can also be made to enhance the\nvisual rendering of information as well. First, for conveying\nthe association between the clusters, in this work we only\nvisualize the cardinality of t he association and filter them\nby variance. There are other measures of proportionality\navailable which can help evaluate the association of comor-\nbidities [31]. We would like to study each method ’sr o l e\nand effectiveness by conducting different analysis tasks.\nSecond, for conveying and comparing the nature of each\ncluster, in this work we only present such information as\ntext that shows the dominant factors of the cluster and\nindicate uncertainty. However, the underlying differences\nare non-binary and high-dimensional. Getting the system\nto effectively extract and present the subtle differences\nbetween the clusters could be the key to improving visual\npattern depiction.\nFinally, it is possible to improve the computational\nperformance by parallel data processing. Some of the\nsteps in the analysis process are easily parallelizable\nwhile others, such as patient clustering, are not. We also\nintend to investigate more advanced database structures\nfor efficient data management.\nHuang et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making  (2015) 15:92 Page 12 of 14\nConclusions\nIn this study, we develop a visual mining system to support\nexploratory data analysis of mul ti-dimensional categorical\nEMR data. Using CKD as a model disease, a CKD cohort\nwas assembled by automated correlational analysis and\nhuman-curated visual evaluation. Our system also shows\nrelevant comorbidities that CKD patients develop over\ntime.\nAll of this information is combined to produce a Sankey\ndiagram that reveals useful but non-obvious knowledge\nabout the CKD cohort and the expected trajectories of the\ndisease over 13 years. Furthermore, the various parameters\ngoverning cohort selection, comorbidity selection, and\ntemporal features are all adjustable by the user and requires\nno programming knowledge.\nFinally, the analysis process is generalizable to any other\ndisease that a user wishes to follow over time and can\nwork with different clustering and filtering algorithms.\nAbbreviations\nEMRs: Electronic medical records; CKD: Chronic kidney disease;\nNHIRD: National Health Insurance Research Database; ICD-9-CM: International\nClassification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification;\nCVD: Cerebrovascular disease; CHF: Congestive heart failure; CAD: Coronary\nartery disease; DM: Diabetes mellitus; GN: Glomerulonephritis;\nHTN: Hypertension; HD: Hemodialysis; PD: Peritoneal dialysis; RTPL: Renal\ntransplant; PKD: Polycystic kidney disease; SLE: Systemic lupus erythematosus.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nC-W.H., C-F.W., J.L., K-L.M. and YC L. invented and developed the methodology.\nY-C.L., W-S.J. and P-A.A.N. obtained the data.
