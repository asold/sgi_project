    "abstract": "Within low-light imaging environment, the insufficient reflected light from objects often results in unsatisfactory images with degradations of low contrast, noise artifacts, or color distortion. The captured low-light images usually lead to poor visual perception quality for color deficient or normal observers. To address the above problems, we propose an end-to-end low-light image enhancement network by combining transformer and CNN (convolutional neural network) to restore the normal light images. Specifically, the proposed enhancement network is designed into a U-shape structure with several functional fusion blocks. Each fusion block includes a transformer stem and a CNN stem, and those two stems collaborate to accurately extract the local and global features. In this way, the transformer stem is responsible for efficiently learning global semantic information and capturing long-term dependencies, while the CNN stem is good at learning local features and focusing on detailed features. Thus, the proposed enhancement network can accurately capture the comprehensive semantic information of low-light images, which significantly contribute to recover normal light images. The proposed method is compared with the current popular algorithms quantitatively and qualitatively. Subjectively, our method significantly improves the image brightness, suppresses the image noise, and maintains the texture details and color information. For objective metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), image perceptual similarity (LPIPS), DeltaE, and NIQE, our method improves the optimal values by 1.73 dB, 0.05, 0.043, 0.7939, and 0.6906, respectively, compared with other methods. The experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively solve the problems of underexposure, noise interference, and color inconsistency in micro-optical images, and has certain application value.",
