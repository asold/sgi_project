Early\nmethods in the 80s and 90s (Joskowicz et al., 1989;\nKaplan and Berry-Rogghe, 1991; Garcia et al.,\n1997; Khoo et al., 1998) mainly relied on defin-\ning hand-crafted rules to find cause-effect relations.\nStarting 2000, machine learning tools were utilized\nin building causal relation extraction models (Girju,\n2003; Chang and Choi, 2004, 2006; Blanco et al.,\n2008; Do et al., 2011; Hashimoto et al., 2012;\nHidey and McKeown, 2016). Word-embeddings\nand Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have also\nbeen leveraged in training models for understand-\ning causality in language in recent years (Dunietz\net al., 2018; Pennington et al., 2014; Dasgupta et al.,\n2018; Gao et al., 2019).\nInvestigating the true capability of pretrained\nlanguage models in understanding causality in text\nis still an open question. More recently, Knowl-\nedge Graphs (KGs) have been used in combination\nwith pretrained language models to address com-\nmonsense reasoning. Two examples are Causal-\nBERT (Li et al., 2020) for guided generation\nof Cause and Effect and the model introduced\nby Guan et al. (2020) for commonsense story gen-\neration.\nATOM IC2020\n(Subject, Relation, Target)\nKG-To-TextGrammar Check\nData Preparation\nEventSocial\nPhysical\nMLM PretrainingTriple Template\nRelation Categories\nEvaluationCOPABCOPA-CE\nBERT\nTCR\nFigure 1: Overview of our proposed framework to con-\ntinually pretrain PLMs with commonsense reasoning\nknowledge.\nMotivated by the success of continual pre-\ntraining of PLMs for downstream tasks (Gururan-\ngan et al., 2020), we explore the impact of common\nsense knowledge injection as a form of continual\npretraining for causal reasoning and cause-effect\nrelation classification. It is worth highlighting that\neven though there are studies to show the efficacy\nof knowledge injection with continual pretraining\nfor commonsense reasoning (Guan et al., 2020),\nperformance of these techniques is very dependent\non the domain and downstream tasks (Gururangan\net al., 2020). And, to the best of our knowledge,\nthere are limited studies on the effect of common-\nsense knowledge injection with knowledge graph\ndata on cause-effect relation classification (Dalal\n43\net al., 2021). Our contributions are as follows:\n• We study performance of PLMs augmented\nwith knowledge graph data in the less investi-\ngated cause-effect relation classification task.\n• We demonstrate that a simple masked lan-\nguage modeling framework using automat-\nically verbalized knowledge graph triples,\nwithout any further model improvement (e.g.,\nnew architecture or loss function) or qual-\nity enhanced data for fine-tuning, can signifi-\ncantly boost the performance in cause-effect\npair classification.\n• We publicly release our knowledge graph ver-\nbalization codes and continually pretrained\nmodels.\n2 Method\nThe overview of our method is shown in Figure 1.1\nWe first convert triples in ATOMIC20\n20 (Hwang et al.,\n2021) knowledge graph to natural language texts.\nThen we continually pretrain BERT using Masked\nLanguage Modeling (MLM) and evaluate perfor-\nmance of the resulting model on different bench-\nmarks. Samples in ATOMIC20\n20 are stored as triples\nin the form of (head/subject, relation, tail/target)\nin three splits including train, development, and\ntest. ATOMIC20\n20 has 23 relation types that are clas-\nsified into three categorical types including com-\nmonsense relations of social interactions, physical-\nentity commonsense relations, and event-centric\ncommonsense relations. In the rest of the paper, we\nrefer to these three categories as social, physical,\nand event, respectively.\n2.1 Filtering Triples\nWe remove all duplicates and ignore all triples\nin which the target value is none. Moreover,\nwe ignore all triples that include a blank. Since\nin masked language modeling we need to know\nthe gold value of masked tokens, a triple that al-\nready has a blank (masked token/word) in it may\nnot help our pretraining. For instance, in the\ntriple: [PersonX affords another ___,\nxAttr, useful] it is hard to know why or un-\nderstand what it means for a person to be useful\nwithout knowing what they afforded. This prepro-\ncessing step yields in 782,848 triples with 121,681,\n1Codes and models are publicly available at https://\ngithub.com/phosseini/causal-reasoning.\n177,706, and 483,461 from event, physical, and so-\ncial categories, respectively.

Following Sap et al. (2019), we replace\nPersonX with a name.\n2.2 Converting Triples\nEach relation in ATOMIC20\n20 is associated with a\nhuman-readable template. For example, xEffect’s\nand HasPrerequisite’s templates are as a result,\nPersonX willand to do this, one requires, respec-\ntively. We use these templates to convert triples\nin ATOMIC20\n20 to sentences in natural language by\nconcatenating the subject, relation template, and\ntarget. Examples of converting triples to text are\nshown in Figure 3.\n2.3 Checking Grammar\nWhen we convert triples to natural language text,\nideally we want to have grammatically correct sen-\ntences. Human readable templates provided by\nATOMIC20\n20 are not necessarily rendered in a way\nto form error-free sentences when concatenated\nwith subject and target in a triple. To address this\nissue, we use an open-source grammar and spell\n44\nchecker, LanguageTool,2 to double-check our con-\nverted triples to ensure they do not contain obvious\ngrammatical mistakes or spelling errors. Similar\napproaches that include deterministic grammati-\ncal transformations were also previously used to\nconvert KG triples to coherent sentences (Davison\net al., 2019). It is worth pointing out that the Data-\nTo-Text generation (KG verbalization) for itself is a\nseparate task and there have been efforts to address\nthis task (Agarwal et al., 2021). We leave investi-\ngating the effects of using other Data-To-Text and\ngrammar-checking methods to future research.\n2.4 Continual Pretraining\nAs mentioned earlier, we use MLM to continually\npretrain our PLM, BERT-large-cased (Devlin et al.,\n2018). We follow the same procedure as BERT to\ncreate the input data to our pretraining (e.g., num-\nber of tokens to mask in input examples). We run\nthe pretraining using ATOMIC20\n20’s train and devel-\nopment splits as our training and evaluation sets,\nrespectively, for 10 epochs on Google Colab TPU\nv2 using PyTorch/XLApackage with a maximum\nsequence length of 30 and batch size of 128.3 To\navoid overfitting, we use early stopping with the\npatience of 3 on evaluation loss. We select the best\nmodel based on the lowest evaluation loss at the\nend of training.4\n3 Experiments\n3.1 Benchmarks\nWe chose multiple benchmarks of commonsense\ncausal reasoning and cause-effect relation classi-\nfication to ensure we thoroughly test the effects\nof our newly trained models. These benchmarks\ninclude: 1) Temporal and Causal Reasoning (TCR)\ndataset (Ning et al., 2018), a benchmark for joint\nreasoning of temporal and causal relations; 2)\nChoice Of Plausible Alternatives (COPA) (Roem-\nmele et al., 2011) dataset which is a widely used\nand notable benchmark (Rogers et al., 2021) for\ncommonsense causal reasoning; And 3) BCOPA-\nCE (Han and Wang, 2021), a new benchmark\ninspired by COPA, that contains unbiased token\ndistributions which makes it a more challenging\nbenchmark. For COPA-related experiments, since\nCOPA does not have a training set, we use COPA’s\n2https://tinyurl.com/yc77k3fb\n3%99.99 of ATOMIC20\n20 instances have 30 tokens or less.\n4We use Huggingface’s BertForMaskedLM implementa-\ntion.\ndevelopment set for fine-tuning our models and\ntesting them on COPA’s test set (COPA-test) and\nBCOPA-CE. For hyperparameter tuning, we ran-\ndomly split COPA’s development set into train\n(%90) and dev (%10) and find the best learning rate,\nbatch size, and number of train epochs based on the\nevaluation accuracy on the development set. Then\nusing COPA’s original development set and best set\nof hyperparameters, we fine-tune our models and\nevaluate them on the test set. In all experiments,\nwe report the average performance of models using\nfour different random seeds. For TCR, we fine-tune\nand evaluate our models on train and test splits, re-\nspectively.\n3.2 Models and Baseline\nWe usebert-large-cased pre-trained model in all ex-\nperiments as our baseline. For COPA and BCOPA-\nCE, we convert all instances to a SW AG-formatted\ndata (Zellers et al., 2018) and use Huggingface’s\nBertForMultipleChoice –a BERT model with a\nmultiple-choice classification head on top. And for\nTCR, we convert every instance by adding special\ntokens to input sequences as event boundaries and\nuse the R-BERT 5 model (Wu and He, 2019). We\nchose R-BERT for our relation classification since\nit not only leverages the pretrained embeddings but\nalso transfers information of target entities (e.g.,\nevents in a relation) through model’s architecture\nand incorporates encodings of the targets entities.\nExamples of COPA and TCR are shown in Figure 4.\nBCOPA-CE has the same format as COPA.\n𝑃: The computer crashed.𝐻!: I backed up my files.asks-for=”cause\"\n𝐻\": I downloaded a virus.\nCOPATCRThe death toll <e1>climbed</e1>to 99 on Sunday after a suicide car bomb <e2>exploded</e2>Friday in the middle of a group of men playing volleyball in northwest Pakistan, police said.Cause-Effect(e1,e2)\n[CLS]The computer crashed.[SEP]I backed up my files.[SEP][CLS]The computer crashed.[SEP]I downloaded a virus.[SEP]\nFigure 4: COPA and TCR examples.

We initially observed that a continually\npretrained model using all three types of relations\nhas a lower performance than our baseline. By\ntaking a closer look at each relation type, we de-\ncided to train another model, this time only using\nthe event relations. The reason is that event-centric\nrelations in ATOMIC20\n20 specifically contain com-\nmonsense knowledge about event interaction for\nunderstating likely causal relations between events\nin the world (Hwang et al., 2021). In addition,\nevent relations have a relatively longer context (#\nof tokens) than the average of all three relation\ntypes combined which means more context for a\nmodel to learn from. Our new pretrained model out-\nperformed the baseline by nearly %5 which shows\nthe effect of augmented pretrained language model\nwith commonsense reasoning knowledge.\nModel Acc (%)\nPMI (Roemmele et al., 2011) 58.8\nb-l-reg(Han and Wang, 2021) 71.1\nGoogle T5-base (Raffel et al., 2019) 71.2\nBERT-large (Kavumba et al., 2019) 76.5\nCausalBERT (Li et al., 2020) 78.6\nBERT-SocialIQA (Sap et al., 2019)∗ 80.1\nBERT-large (baseline)❈ 74.4\nATOMIC-BERT-largeMLM ❈\n- Event only 79.2\nGoogle T5-11B (Raffel et al., 2019) 94.8\nDeBERTa-1.5B (He et al., 2020) 96.8\nTable 2: COPA-test Accuracy results. ❈ Our models.\n∗ For a fair comparison, we report BERT-SocialIQA’s\naverage performance.\nWe further experiment on the Easy and Hard\nquestion splits in COPA-test separated by Kavumba\net al. (2019) to see how our best model performs\non harder questions that do not contain superficial\ncues. Results are shown in Table 3. As can be\nseen, our ATOMIC-BERT model significantly out-\nperforms both the baseline and former models on\nHard and Easy questions.\nModel Easy ↑ Hard↑\n(Han and Wang, 2021) - 69.7\n(Kavumba et al., 2019) 83.9 71.9\nBERT-large (baseline)❈ 83.0 69.2\nATOMIC-BERT-large❈ 88.9 73.1\nTable 3: COPA-test Accuracy results on Easy and Hard\nquestion subsets. ❈ Our models.\nIt is worth mentioning three points here. First,\nour model, BERT-large, has a significantly lower\nnumber of parameters than state-of-the-art models,\nGoogle T5-11B (∼32x) and DeBERTa-1.5B (∼4x)\nand it shows how smaller models can be compet-\nitive and benefit from continual pretraining. Sec-\nond, we have not yet applied any model improve-\nment methods such as using a margin-based loss\nintroduced by Li et al. (2019) and used in Causal-\nBERT (Li et al., 2020), an extra regularization loss\nproposed by Han and Wang (2021), or fine-tuning\nwith quality-enhanced training data, BCOPA, intro-\nduced by Kavumba et al. (2019). As a result, there\nis still great room to improve current models that\ncan be a proper next step. Third, we achieved a per-\nformance on par with BERT-SocialIQA (Sap et al.,\n2019) 6 while we did not use crowdsourcing or any\nmanual re-writing/correction, which is expensive,\nfor verbalizing KG triples to create our pretraining\ndata.\nModel Acc (%)\nb-l-aug(Han and Wang, 2021) 51.1\nb-l-reg(Han and Wang, 2021) 64.1\nBERT-large (baseline)❈ 55.8\nATOMIC-BERT-largeMLM ❈\n- Event only 58.1\nTable 4: BCOPA-CE Accuracy results. ❈ Our models.\n∗ Base model in b-l-* is BERT-large.\n4.1 BCOPA-CE: Prompt vs. No Prompt\nResults of experiments on BCOPA-CE are shown\nin Table 4.
