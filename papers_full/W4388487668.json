However, the large-scale extraction of key surgical \noncologic insights contained within unstructured free pathology text is limited by the need for \nlabor-intensive, manual review or error-prone natural language processing (NLP) based on \nstatistical or rule-based approaches (1, 2).  Large language models (LLM) power a new \ngeneration of natural language processing (NLP) whereby deep neural networks are trained on \nhuman language deconstructed into vectorized embeddings that depict linguistic relationships in \na numerical format appropriate for easy analysis (3).  Popularized by ChatGPT and its user-\nfriendly question and answer interface, LLMs are poised to transform the scalability of clinical \nNLP downstream tasks such as medical question answering (MQA) and may enhance the ability \nto rapidly and accurately extract key information from surgical pathology reports (4).            \nHowever, ethical, privacy and regulatory constraints preclude the transfer of protected \nhealth information (PHI) across the public domain through widely used LLM services \n(ChatGPT, Bard) that can generate automated responses for MQA. Furthermore, proprietary \nLLMs may be both expensive, and subject to unpredictable changes in performance.  To address \nthese issues, we develop a framework to utilize a privacy-preserving, local LLM for extracting \nkey staging and recurrence risk information from thyroid surgical pathology reports. Although \nwe utilize this for a single use case, our work serves as a novel paradigm to enable individual \nmedical centers to utilize LLM technology for clinical NLP tasks in a privacy protecting manner \n(Figure 1).     \n \nAll rights reserved.

We queried our system wide database for a cohort of adult patients \nwith diagnosis codes for thyroid cancer and who underwent thyroid surgery between 2010 and \n2022. We reviewed 102 pathology reports from 102 patients and excluded reports if they were \nother organ site (n=10), benign (n=2), cytopathology (n=5), or outside review (n=1). We \nincluded 84 reports for analysis.  Study flowchart is shown in Figure 2.   \n \nDevelopment of Large Language Model \nWe used the publicly available, open-source FastChat-T5 3B-parameter LLM for our \nanalysis.  A limitation all LLMs have is the amount of context they may process at once.  For \nreports of length greater than what the model could accommodate, we split report text into 1200 \ncharacter long segments, followed by converting each of these segments into machine-readable \nnumerical representations called embeddings.  Since embeddings encode meaning, calculating \nsimilarity scores between segment embeddings and posed questions allowed us to retrieve the \npieces of text most directly related to the content of the question.  As such, three segments with \nthe highest similarity scores were integrated to create the final context for the LLM.  This \ncontext was made part of a plain language question for the LLM, alongside a question it was \ndirected to answer. \n \nDevelopment of Medical Question and Answering and Evaluation of Concordance  \nAll rights reserved.

For every question we determined if \nanswers were concordant between: Reviewer 1 and the LLM, Reviewer 2 and the LLM, and \nbetween the two reviewers.  Concordance rate for each pairwise comparison was then calculated \nas the total number of concordant answers divided by the total number of answers for each of the \ntwelve questions (Figure 2).  The average concordance rate and standard deviation of all \nquestions were calculated for each pairwise comparison.  \n \nResults  \nWe report sample LLM responses and the concordance rates between reviewers and the \nLLM for each question in Table 1.  1,008 total questions were answered for 84 thyroid surgical \npathology reports.  Reviewers 1 and 2 were concordant at an overall rate of 99.1% (SD: 1.0%) \nwith disagreement on 9 answers.  Reviewers 1 and 2 took an average of 2.36 minutes and 1.48 \nminutes to respond to each pathology report and 206.9 minutes and 124.04 minutes for all \nreports, respectively. The LLM was concordant with reviewers 1 and 2 at an overall rate of \n88.86% (SD: 7.02%) and 89.56 (SD: 7.20%).  Average time to review each report for the LLM \nwas 13.97 seconds/report and 19.56 minutes for all reports.  The questions with the highest \noverall rates of concordant responses were questions requiring binary or categorical data \nextraction (Is lymphatic invasion present, 100%, Is vascular invasion present, 98.81%, Where is \nAll rights reserved.

The question with the lowest overall concordance was, \nWere cervical lymph nodes present? at 75%.       \nDiscussion \n We demonstrate and evaluate the extraction performance of a privacy-preserving LLM \nfor a specific clinical NLP task. The LLM took 19.56 minutes to evaluate and respond to all \npathology reports, whereas it required an additional 187 minutes and 105 minutes for the \nreviewers to complete the same task— demonstrating a considerable reduction in time.  \nRegarding accuracy of responses, we find that rates of response concordance were higher \namongst questions tasked with simpler binary or categorical responses.  Increase in task \ncomplexity requiring textual interpretation and inconsistent word prompting such as asking \nwhether there was “cervical” lymph nodes present resulted in the lowest rate of concordance.  \nFurthermore, the question of size of the primary tumor also seemed to be relatively \nstraightforward but only had an overall concordance rate of 82%.   \n The augmentation of poorer performing MQA may lie in the improvement of prompt \nengineering— an emerging subfield where domain specific knowledge and linguistics are \noptimized to design questions that yield the best performing response to a task, in addition to \nmore expressive embeddings that better help localize relevant text (7).  For example, “cervical” \ndoes not appear in most pathological reports verbatim, possibly limiting the model’s ability to \nrespond appropriately to the question regarding the presence of cervical lymph nodes.  Also, the \nLLM often incorrectly identified the size of the “primary tumor” and would instead provide a \ndimension from another specimen in the report, such as the overall thyroid lobe.  This response \naccuracy may also be improved by modifying the question prompt and will be the focus of future \nwork. \nAll rights reserved.

Our method of developing and deploying LLMs behind a healthcare \ninstitution’s own computing resources, ensures that centers could utilize this emerging \ntechnology while maintaining patient privacy.  Additionally, since we utilize the inherent \nreasoning ability of such models, they do not require any task specific fine-tuning, and by \nextension can be operated inexpensively.  Furthermore, the increased language capacity of latest \ngeneration of LLMs allows for institutions to deploy their own data for in-context learning only \nwhile achieving a reasonable performance.   \n \nConclusion \nWe envision that LLMs will allow medical institutions to harness cutting-edge advances \nin NLP for timely and privacy-preserving MQA data extraction from pathology reports and other \nclinical narratives for the provision of real-time, essential oncologic insights. \n \nFunding/Financial support  \nThe authors received no funding for this study.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll rights reserved.
