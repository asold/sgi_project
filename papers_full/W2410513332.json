However, the \nintroduction of nonlinear transformer models will make the OPF \nmodel non-convex. This letter presents an exact linearized \ntransformer’s OLTC (On-Load Tap-Changer) model to keep the \nOPF model convex via binary expansion scheme and big-M \nmethod.  Validity of the proposed method is verified using IEEE \n33-bus test network. \n1 Index Terms —distribution networks, optimal power flow, \nOLTC \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nPTIMAL power flow is an essential method to reduce \nnetwork losses and optimize voltage profile in \ndistribution networks. In [1], the relaxation and \nconvexification of branch flow based OPF model are well \ndiscussed, which is ultimately formulated as a second-order \ncone programming (SOCP) problem (SOCP-OPF). However, \nthe transformer has been ignored in this model, which is \ncritical to improve voltage profile. In published works, \ntransformer tap ratio is usually approximately modeled [2] or \nrelaxed to continuous variables [3], which may lead to \nsuboptimal or infeasible solutions [2]. In this letter, an exact \nlinearized transformer’s OLTC model is proposed and \nincorporated into the SOCP-OPF model. \nII.

NUMERICAL EXAMPLE \nThe proposed OPF problem is tested on a modified IEEE \n33-bus system [4]. Transformers are installed on branch 1-2, \n2-19, 3-23 and 6-26. The turns ratio of each transformer varies \nbetween 0.95 to 1.05 with same change per tap, denoted by t . \nDGs are installed at buses 6, 14 and 29. The minimum and \nmaximum allowable bus voltages are 0.95 p.u. and 1.05 p.u., \nrespectively. \nThe program is implemented using YALMIP®  and \nCPLEX®. Numerical tests are performed on a computer with \nIntel® Core™ i5 (2.60 GHz) and 12 GB RAM. In order to \nillustrate the effectiveness of the transformer linearization \nmethod and extra computation time caused by the mixed \ninteger linear constraints, six scenarios are tested: 1) 0.02\nt  ;  \n2) 0.01t ;  3) 0.005t ; 4) 0.002t ; 5) 0.001t ; 6) \nturns ratios fixed to the results of  scenario 3. The power \nlosses and computation time of our method and the method in \n[6] for each scenario are listed in Table I. \nTable I Simulation results for 33-bus system \nScenario Taps Power Losses (kW) CPU Time (s) \nOur method Method in [6]\n1 5 41.2 1.03 1.40 \n2 10 41.0 1.60 2.01 \n3 20 41.0 1.62 2.17 \n4 50 40.9 2.37 5.17 \n5 100 40.9 2.72 14.60 \n6 200 40.9 2.84 39.19 \nFrom the results of scenarios 1, 2 and 3, we can see that \nmore power losses can be reduced by optimizing tap-changers \nwith more taps, while the computation times grow due to the \nincreasing of binary variables. However, the additional \ncomputation burden introduced by the transformer constraints \nis moderate (comparing scenario 3 with 6) because the binary \nexpansion scheme does not involve large number of binary \nvariables in transformer model. And the proposed method has \nhigher computational efficiency compared to [6] due to less \nbinary variables. \nThe approximate method in [2] and the proposed exact \nmethod in this paper are tested with \n0.005t . The turns \nratios and power losses are listed in Table II. \nTable II Results of our method and method in [2] \nMethod 21t  19 2t   23 3t   26 6t   Power Losses (kW)\nMethod in [2] 1.05 1.0012 1.0012 1.0062 41.1 \nOur method 1.05 1 1.005 1.01 41.0 \nFrom Table II, we can see that the turns ratios solved by the \napproximate method [2] are not accurate. The method \nproposed in this paper is exact and the solution is optimal. \nIV.  CONCLUSIONS \nThe nonlinear transformer model is exactly linearized by \nbinary expansion scheme and big-M method. This exact \nlinearized transformer model involves few binary variables \nand can be incorporated into the SOCP-OPF problem in \ndistribution networks. The proposed method has been \nsimulated on a IEEE 33-bus system under different scenarios \nto demonstrate its effectiveness. \nR\nEFERENCES \n[1]   M. Farivar and S. H.
