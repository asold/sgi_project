  "abstract": "Network and cloud environments must be fortified against a dynamic array of threats, and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are critical tools for identifying and thwarting hostile activities. IDSs, classified as anomaly-based or signature-based, have increasingly incorporated deep learning models into their framework. Recently, significant advancements have been made in anomaly-based IDSs, particularly those using machine learning, where attack detection accuracy has been notably high. Our proposed method demonstrates that deep learning models can achieve unprecedented success in identifying both known and unknown threats within cloud environments. However, existing benchmark datasets for intrusion detection typically contain more normal traffic samples than attack samples to reflect real-world network traffic. This imbalance in the training data makes it more challenging for IDSs to accurately detect specific types of attacks. Thus, our challenges arise from two key factors, unbalanced training data and the emergence of new, unidentified threats. To address these issues, we present a hybrid transformer-convolutional neural network (Transformer-CNN) deep learning model, which leverages data resampling techniques such as adaptive synthetic (ADASYN), synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), edited nearest neighbors (ENN), and class weights to overcome class imbalance. The transformer component of our model is employed for contextual feature extraction, enabling the system to analyze relationships and patterns in the data effectively. In contrast, the CNN is responsible for final classification, processing the extracted features to accurately identify specific attack types. The Transformer-CNN model focuses on three primary objectives to enhance detection accuracy and performance: (1) reducing false positives and false negatives, (2) enabling real-time intrusion detection in high-speed networks, and (3) detecting zero-day attacks. We evaluate our proposed model, Transformer-CNN, using the NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 and CICIDS2017 benchmark datasets, and assess its performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate that our method achieves an impressive 99.71% accuracy in binary classification and 99.02% in multi-class classification on the NF-UNSW-NB15-v2 dataset, while for the CICIDS2017 dataset, it reaches 99.93% in binary classification and 99.13% in multi-class classification, significantly outperforming existing models. This proves the enhanced capability of our IDS in defending cloud environments against intrusions, including zero-day attacks.",
