The growing is mainly due to the fact that these \nsystems have been constantly improving in terms of \nefficiency, power, reliability, etc. On the other hand, the \npolicies stated by the governments in many countries \nhave allowed the spread of the PV systems. The PV sys-\ntem can be designed either in island or grid connected \nmode being the last one the most commonly used (Kjaer \net al., 2005). The grid connection allows injecting the \npower generated into the electrical grid; in order to \nachieve this objective, the PV system is commonly set \nby using three stages: the PV array, the power inverter \nand the grid filter with the galvanic isolation (Kerekes \net al., 2009). In the conventional PV systems, the last sta-\nge includes a LFT to link the converter with the electri-\ncal grid to provide galvanic isolation as it is shown in \nFigure 1. However, the main problem with the LFT is \nthat it introduces around 2% of \npower losses in the system yielding \nlow efficiency. Furthermore, the \nLFT increases the total cost of the \nsystem and the transformer size is \nbig due to the operating frequency \nthat coincides with the frequency of \nthe electrical grid which can be 50 \nor 60Hz (Gonzalez et al., 2007).\nIn order to solve the problem of \nthe transformer size, a HFT has \nbeen proposed as intermediate sta-\nge (Li & Wolrfs, 2008; Xue et al., 2004), the system is \nshown in Figure 2. However, the efficiency in this case \nis significantly reduced, not only because of the losses \nin the transformer but also because of the additional \npower stages that must be added in the power conver-\nsion process. Since the efficiency is one of the most im-\nportant issues in a PV system, transformerless inverters \nhave emerged to mitigate the problems of the galvanic \nisolated systems. As the transformerless inverters are \nconnected directly to the electrical grid, there is not gal-\nvanic isolation between the PV system and the electrical \ngrid dealing in new problems to be solved.\nA PV solar panel naturally presents a stray capacitan-\nce which is formed between the PV cells and the groun-\nded frame like in Figure 3. Thus, when the PV generator \nis connected to the grid by means of a transformerless \ninverter, a leakage current can flow through the stray ca-\npacitances as it is shown in Figure 4. Then, the leakage \ncurrent can generate additional power losses in the sys-\ntem and a high risk of electrical shock for the users in \nResumen\nLos inversores fotovoltaicos (FV) tienen un importante rol en el mercado de la  \nenergía debido a sus excelentes características en relación con el costo y la confiabi -\nlidad. La estructura más usada en la etapa de conversión de un sistema de energía \nsolar incluye un transformador de baja frecuencia (TBF) el cual proporciona aisla -\nmiento galvánico, pero por otro lado reduce la eficiencia total e incrementa el tamaño \ny costo del sistema. Una alternativa para reducir el tamaño del sistema y las pérdidas \nde potencia es usar un transformador de alta frecuencia (TAF), el problema en este \ncaso es que se deben usar algunas etapas de potencia adicionales. Las etapas adicio -\nnales introducen pérdidas de potencia en el proceso de conversión de la energía por \nlo que la eficiencia del sistema se reduce. Por lo tanto, la tendencia en la implemen- \ntación de este tipo de equipos es remover el transformador para incrementar la efi-\nciencia y reducir el costo. Sin embargo, cuando no se provee al sistema de aisla -\nmiento galvánico, surge un problema de seguridad relacionado con las corrientes \nparásitas de modo común. En este artículo se propone una topología de inversor para \nresolver el problema de las corrientes parásitas de modo común en sistemas FV sin \ntransformador. Se proporcionan resultados de simulación con los cuales se hace un \nanálisis relacionado con la eficiencia y el comportamiento del voltaje de modo común \n(VMC) para validar la topología propuesta.\nDescriptores: \n• sistemas fotovoltaicos\n• voltaje de modo común\n• corriente de dispersión\n• eficiencia\n• capacitancia parásita\nDb\nVs\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\nC\nT1\nPV \narray\nLf\nLf\nigrid\nVpv\nFigure\t1.\t\tPV\tinverter\twith\tlow frequency transformer\t(LFT)\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.riit.2015.03.002\n175\nVázquez-Guzmán Gerardo, Martínez-Rodríguez Pánfilo Raymundo, Sosa-Zúñiga José Miguel\nIngeniería Inves tigación y Tecnolo gía, volumen XVI (número 2), abril-junio 2015: 173-1 84 ISSN 2594-0732 FI-UNAM\ncontact with the \nPV installation\n(Gubía et al., \n2007). On the \nother hand, a re-\nsonant circuit is \nformed between \nthe parasitic ca-\npacitances, the\nimpedance of the \nground path and \nthe passive elements in the output filter of the converter \n(Salm et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012). The resonance peak \ncan reach high values yielding serious problems in the \noperation of the circuit. Unfortunately, the value of the \nstray capacitance depends on operational and whether \nconditions as: humidity, PV panel surface, the material \nused in the metallic frame and the values in the passive \nelements of the power converter (Kerekes et al., 2007, Ji et \nal., 2013; Hou et al., 2013), therefore, it is not possible to \nprecisely determine its value. Nevertheless, some experi-\nments have been done in order to estimate the value of \nthese capacitances which according to Lopez et al. (2010) \nis between 50-150 nF/Kw, which is enough to conduct \ncurrent to the ground at the switching frequency (7-20 \nkHz) (Gonzalez et al., 2008). On the other hand, it has \nbeen demonstrated that the magnitude and frequency of \nthe leakage currents, depends mainly on the power con-\nverter topology and its modulation strategy (Xiaomeng \net al., 2011).\nWhen leakage ground currents appear in the stray \ncapacitances in a PV array, it comes up a problem rela-\nted to the personal security. Since in a PV plant \nthere is people in charge of maintenance, they may \ntouch the panel and the leakage current can flow \nthrough their body, causing injury, shock and in \nan extreme case, death. To avoid this kind of situa-\ntions, some standards have been imposed to regu-\nlate the maximum leakage current level that can \nflow through the ground path in transformerless \nPV systems. A normative was established in Ger-\nmany by DIN (Deutsches Institut für Normung e. V.) \nfor transformerless PV systems that have been wi-\ndely extended. One of these standards is the DIN \nVDE 0126-1-1 that regulates the maximum leakage \ncurrent level allowed that can be up to 300 mA \n(DKE, 2005; Vázquez et al., 2010).\nIn this paper a single-phase topology and its \nmodulation strategy are proposed as an alternative \nsolution to the leakage ground current problem. \nThe topology is tested by simulations wich allows \nto compare its performance with other topologies. \nThe paper is organized as follows: second section pre-\nsents a general idea about the common mode behavior \nregarding leakage current in transformerless grid con-\nnected PV systems, third section shows the analysis of \ntwo commercial transformerless PV topologies focused \nin the performance regarding efficiency and common \nmode currents. In the fourth section, the proposed to-\npology and its modulation strategy are presented. Mo-\nreover, the CMV is calculated and a deep analysis of the \nmodulation strategy is performed. Section five deals \nwith the design of the current control used to inject the \npower into the grid. To compare the performance of the \nproposed topology with the conventional ones, nume-\nrical results including leakage current and efficiency \nissues are presented in section six. Finally, the conclu-\nsions are presented in the last section.\nCommon mode model \nTo understand how the leakage current (also call Com-\nmon Mode Current, CMC) is generated through the pa-\nrasitic capacitances, a common mode model is proposed \nin Gubía et al., (2007). The model is focused on provi-\nding a clear idea about how the common mode voltage \nis directly related to the current generated in the ground \npath in the case of a transformerless PV inverter. Before \nstarting with the analysis of a transformerless inverter, \nit is is important to consider the circuit shown in Figure \n5 which corresponds to a PV system with a LFT. In this \ncircuit, the parasitic elements involved in the operation \nof the circuit are included in order to shown the possi-\nble paths for the CMC. \nVS\nDb\nS1\nS2\nS3\nS4\nC\nHFT\nS’1 S’3\nS’4S’2\nCf\nD1 D3\nD2 D4\nigrid\nPV \narray\nLf\nLf\nLf\nVpv\nFigure\t2.\t\tPV\tinverter\twith\thigh frequency transformer\t(HFT)\nSustrate\nCp\nCp Cp\nPV-Cells\nGlass\nCD/CA \nPower \nConverter\nFilter+\nAC Grid\nFigure\t3.\t\tParasitic\tcapacitance\tmodel\tof\ta\tPV\tpanel\nVs\nPV \narray\nCp\nIL\nDC\nAC\nFilter\nFigure\t4.\t\tLeakage\tground\tcurrent\tpath\tin\t\na\ttransformerless\tPV\tinverter\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.riit.2015.03.002\nHigh Efficiency Single-Phase Transformer-less Inverter for Photovoltaic Applications\nIngeniería Inves tigación y Tecnolo gía, volumen XVI (número 2), abril junio 2015: 173-1 84 ISSN 2594-0732 FI-UNAM\n176\nAs can be observed in Figure 5, a possible path for \nthe CMC between the electrical grid and the generator \nis through C t. Ct is a parasitic capacitance located bet-\nween the primary and the secondary winds in the LFT. \nThe typical value of these capacitances is in the order of \nhundreds of picofarads, thus, the impedance of this ca-\npacitances is high at the low and medium switching \nfrequency range (< 50 kHz), therefore, the CMC through \nthe ground path is strongly reduced. Then, if the sys-\ntem is designed with a LFT, the common mode beha-\nviour has no significant influence in the selection of the \npower converter topology and its modulation techni-\nque. On the other hand, if the LFT is omitted in the cir-\ncuit as is depicted in Figure 4, then a path for the CMC \nexists. A common mode model, of the transformerless \nconverter can be derived from the circuit shown in Fi-\ngure 6 (Gubía et al., 2007). The common mode model is \nshown in Figure 7, as it can be observed, there are two \nmain pulse voltage sources named V\nCMV which corres-\nponds to the CMV and Vs1, which represent the influen-\nce of the differential mode voltage (VDMV) in the common \nmode behaviour. The total CMV represented by VCMV-tot \ncan be obtained by adding the above mentioned volta-\nge sources. According to the model, it can be easily de-\nrive that if the V\nCMV-tot doesn’t have high dv/dt (ideally \nconstant), then no CMC will flow through the circuit.\nIn accordance with the common mode model and \nspecially with the equation for the pulse voltage source \nV\ns1, there is a remarkable influence in the common \nmode behaviour related to the position of the filter in-\nductance, thus if the inductance is separated in two \nequal parts located in the line and neutral wires, then \nV\ns1 will be close to zero, otherwise, Vs1 will influence the \ncommon mode behaviour.\nCommercial transformerless topologies\nThere are two outstanding single-phase transformerless \ninverter topologies in the market, called HERIC (Highly \nEfficiency and Reliable Inverter Concept) and H5. These to-\npologies have been well received in the PV market due to \ntheir very good performance regarding \nefficiency and CMV. The HERIC topolo-\ngy which is presented in Figure 8 is ba-\nsed in the conventional HB (H-Bridge) \ninverter, but in this case an extra bidirec-\ntional switch (formed by S5, S6, D7 and \nD8 in Figure 8) is used on the ac side. The \nfunction of the bidirectional switch is to \nprovide the zero states during the positi-\nve and negative semi-cycles of the grid \nperiod. Considering the modulation stra-\ntegy reported in Schmidt et al., (2005), simulation results \nwere performed using PSIM software and the results are \nshown in Figure 9. The output filter was set using an L \nfilter split into two equal parts, one located in the line \npath and the other one located in the path that the cu-\nrrent uses to return to the power source (in this case the \nPV panel), being 2.5 mH in each line. The filter was con-\nfigured in this way because it has been shown that if di-\nfferences in the output filter appear in both lines of the \nload, it will contribute to increase the value of the com-\nmon mode currents (Xiaomeng et al., 2011; Guocheng et \nal., 2012; Barater-Buticchi et al., 2012). The dc bus was set \nusing a constant dc source which was set at 600 V.

The switching \nfrequency was set at 10 kHz while the grid source was \nset at 220 V and 60 Hz. The reference for the power injec-\nted to the grid was set to 4000 W. In Figure 9, from top to \nbottom, load current, voltage between the positive termi-\nnal and ground and leakage current are depicted. As can \nbe seen, the load current is sinusoidal as expected and \nalso the voltage measured between the positive terminal \nof the dc source and ground has a sinusoidal component \nat grid frequency, this means that the dv/dt applied to the \nparasitic capacitor is very slow and \nas a consequence the leakage ground \ncurrent is close to zero.\nAs it was mentioned, the H5 is \nanother inverter topology with \ngreat success in the PV market (Vic-\ntor et al., 2005). The topology is de-\npicted in Figure 10. The topology is \nalso based in the HB configuration \nbut in this case, the zero state in the \nmodulation strategy is generated by \na switch S5 and a switch of the HB \n(S2 or S4). Hence the zero state is \nmade on the dc side (dc-decou-\npling), while the active states are \nmade using the HB circuit as in the HERIC topology. \nSimulation results of this topology under the same con-\nditions than the HERIC converter are shown in Figure \n11 where the grid current appears at the top, the volta-\nge measured between the positive terminal and ground \nappears in the middle and finally the leakage current at \nthe bottom. As it can be observed, the current in this \ncase is sinusoidal, the voltage measured between the \npositive terminal and the ground has also a sinusoidal \ncomponent at the grid frequency which has a very low \ndv/dt, and finally it can be noted that the leakage cu-\nrrent is close to zero.\nThe topologies shown in this section have demons -\ntrated the capability of achieving an excellent perfor-\nmance regarding efficiency (around 98% in both cases) \nas reported in Victor et al., (2005) and Schmidt et al., \n(2005). In the HERIC converter case, the additional \ncomponents are switched at the grid frequency resul-\nting in low switching losses. On the other hand, in the \ncase of the H5 converter the additional component (S5) \nis switched at the switching frequency while S1 is swit-\nched at grid frequency, also resulting in low switching \nlosses. Therefore, if only few additional power devices \nare added to the circuit and an optimized modulation \nstrategy is implemented, the energy conversion process \nPV \narray\nL\nVsC\nS3\nS4\nS1\nS2\nz\nCp1\nA\nB\nigrid\nVpv\nL\nN\nS5\nS6\nD5\nD6\nD7\nD8\nFigure\t8.\t\tSingle-phase\tHERIC\ttransformerless\tinverter\nFigure\t9.\tSimulation\tresults\tof\tthe\tsingle-phase\tHERIC\ttopology,\t\na) grid\tcurrent,\tb)\tVDC\tplus\tto\tground\tvoltage\nand\tc)\tleakage\tground\tcurrent\na)\nb)\nc)\n0.05 0.055 0.06 0.065 0.07 0.075 0.08 0.085 0.09 0.095 0.1\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nLoad Current [A]\nLoad Current\n0.05 0.055 0.06 0.065 0.07 0.075 0.08 0.085 0.09 0.095 0.1\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500VDC+ [V]\nVDC Plus Terminal to Ground\n0.05 0.055 0.06 0.065 0.07 0.075 0.08 0.085 0.09 0.095 0.1\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nIleakage [A]\nTime [s]\nLeakage Current\nPV \narray\nL\nVsC\nS3\nS4\nS1\nS2\nz\nCp1\nA\nB\nigrid\nL\nN\nS5\nFigure\t10.\t\tSingle-phase\tH5\ttransformerless\tinverter\na)\nb)\nc)\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.riit.2015.03.002\nHigh Efficiency Single-Phase Transformer-less Inverter for Photovoltaic Applications\nIngeniería Inves tigación y Tecnolo gía, volumen XVI (número 2), abril junio 2015: 173-1 84 ISSN 2594-0732 FI-UNAM\n178\ncan be made with a good performance regarding effi-\nciency. Besides efficiency, HERIC and H5 comply with \nthe standards that limit the maximum leakage current \nlevels allowed.\nProposed topology \nGiven the characteristics described above about the \nHERIC converter (efficiency and CMV), a variant of \nthis topology with its modulation strategy is proposed \nin this paper. The proposed topology and the circuit to \ngenerate the modulation sequence are depicted in Fi-\ngure 12. The main idea is to generate the zero state \nusing a modified bidirectional switch on the ac side. \nThe modulation strategy proposed to control the in-\nverter is as follows: during the positive half-cycle, the \nactive state is generated when S1 and S4 are ON (S3 \nand S2 are OFF) while S5 is OFF and S6 is ON, therefo-\nre the current flows through S1 and S4 toward the \nload. In this situation, as shown in Figure 13, there is \nnot current flowing through the bidirectional switch, \ndue to the inverse polarization of D5. In order to gene-\nrate the null state, S1 and S4 must be switched OFF \nwhile S6 remains ON. In this way, the current flows in \nthe bidirectional switch through S6 and diode D5, be-\ncause D5 is directly polarized due to the voltage gene-\nrated by the energy stored in the inductance L; this is \nthe freewheeling situation in the positive half-cycle as \nshown in Figure 14.\nOn the other hand, during the negative half-cycle, \nthe active state is generated using S2 and S3 (S1 and S4 \nare OFF) as in the conventional HB inverter, while S5 \nis ON and S6 is OFF. During this state the current \nflows toward the load through the switches S2 and S3 \nas shown in Figure 15. The load current does not flow \nthrough the bidirectional switch because of the inver-\nse polarization of D6. The null state during the negati-\nve half-cycle is generated when S3 and S2 are switched \nOFF while S5 remains ON. Therefore the load current \nwill flow through the bidirectional switch (S5 and D6), \nbecause D6 is directly polarized due to the voltage ge-\nnerated by the energy stored in the inductance L, as it \nis shown in Figure 16.\nThe analysis of the equivalent circuits for the diffe-\nrent operation modes along the grid period allows to \nobtain the CMV which is defined in (1) as the sum of the \nvoltages from the output terminals to a common point \n(Barater et al., 2012).\n  (1)\n2\nAZ BZ\ncm\nVVV +=\nS1\nVtriVsin\nS5\nS6\nS4\nS2\nS3\nPV \narray\nL\nVsC\nS3\nS4\nS1\nS2\nz\nCp1\nA\nB\nigrid\nVpv\nL\nN\nS5\nS6\nD5\nD6\nFigure\t11.\t\tSimulation\tresults\tof\tthe\tsingle-phase\tH5\ttopology,\t\na) grid\tcurrent,\tb)\tVDC\tplus\tto\tground\tvoltage\tand\nc) leakage\tground\tcurrent\nFigure\t12.\t\tProposed\tsingle-phase\ttransformerless\tinverter\tand\tits\tmodulation\tcircuit\na)\nb)\nc)\nD\f\nE\f\nF\f\n\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0018\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0019 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0019\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001a \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001a\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001b \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001b\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001c \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001c\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0014\n\u0010\u0017\u0013\n\u0010\u0016\u0013\n\u0010\u0015\u0013\n\u0010\u0014\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0014\u0013\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0016\u0013\n\u0017\u0013\n/RDG\u0003&XUUHQW\u0003>$@\n/RDG\u0003&XUUHQW\n\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0018\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0019 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0019\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001a \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001a\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001b \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001b\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001c \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001c\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0014\n\u0014\u0013\u0013\n\u0015\u0013\u0013\n\u0016\u0013\u0013\n\u0017\u0013\u0013\n\u0018\u0013\u00139'&\u000e\u0003>9@\n9'&\u00033OXV\u00037HUPLQDO\u0003WR\u0003*URXQG\n\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0018\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0019 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0019\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001a \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001a\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001b \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001b\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001c \u0013\u0011\u0013\u001c\u0018 \u0013\u0011\u0014\n\u0010\u0013\u0011\u0016\n\u0010\u0013\u0011\u0015\n\u0010\u0013\u0011\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0011\u0014\n\u0013\u0011\u0015\n\u0013\u0011\u0016\n,OHDNDJH\u0003>$@\n7LPH\u0003>V@\n/HDNDJH\u0003&XUUHQW\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.riit.2015.03.002\n179\nVázquez-Guzmán Gerardo, Martínez-Rodríguez Pánfilo Raymundo, Sosa-Zúñiga José Miguel\nIngeniería Inves tigación y Tecnolo gía, volumen XVI (número 2), abril-junio 2015: 173-1 84 ISSN 2594-0732 FI-UNAM\nUsing equation (1), the CMV generated regarding posi-\ntive, negative and zero vectors, can be calculated as fo-\nllows:\nPositive:\n \n      (2)\nZero: (3)\nNegative:  \n (4)\nAs can \nbe observed from (2) to (4), the CMV remains \nconstant along the different switching states.

This te-\nchnique consists in calculating an adequate current re-\nference to inject active power into the grid. Then, a \ncurrent control loop is designed based in the model of \nthe system. Additionally, a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) can \nbe used to synchronise the injected current whit the \ngrid voltage. The numerical results presented in this \npaper have been developed considering this control \nstrategy. In this section the outlines to develop a cu-\nrrent mode control are presented.\nFor the single-phase transformerless converter shown \nin Figure 12 the current dynamic can be modeled as\n  (5)\nThe parameter \nL1 represents the total value of the in-\nductance output filter and r1 the parasitic resistance as-\nsociated to the output filter.

The current tracking objective is designed \nto guarantee the tracking of the line current towards a \ncurrent reference signal i*\ngrid, that is\n \nThe current reference signal can be constructed in diffe-\nrent ways, but for the grid tied applications it is propo-\nsed as a signal proportional to the fundamental of the \ngrid voltage. Therefore, an adequate definition of the \ncurrent reference avoids the injection of reactive and \nharmonic power in to the grid. Then the current refe-\nrence is calculated as \n  (6)\nWhere vS,1 is the fundamental component of the line \nvoltage and Pref is a modulating current signal calcula-\nted in an outer voltage loop.\nThe fundamental component v S,1 is obtained by an \nadditional PLL as is mentioned in Escobar et al. (2013) \nwith the following structure\n (7)\nii) Current\tcontrol\tloop\tdesign\nIn order to simplify the control design, the following \ntransformations are proposed\nx\n1 = igrid  (8)\ne = \nuVpv (9)\nThen the current dynamic can be rewritten as\n (10)\nwhere the following controller stabilizes the subsystem \n(10) and is able to track with a v\nery small steady state \nerror the current reference signal i*grid\n    (11)\nNotice that, the proposed control scheme is not able to \nguarantee a perfect tracking, this can \nbe observed in slight \ncurrent deformations or in small current lags with respect \nto the grid voltage phase. A solution for this issue is to \nplace a Proportional plus Resonant controller in the cu-\nrrent loop; but this issue is out of the scope of this paper.\nNumerical results\nThe proposed topology and its modulation strategy \nwere tested by simulation with the same parameters \nused in the case of H5 and HERIC topologies. The re-\nsults are shown in Figure 17, from top to bottom, the \nload current, the voltage measured between the positi-\nve terminal and ground (also called “Leakage Volta-\nge”) and the leakage current are depicted. As shown, \nthe load current is close to a sinusoidal waveform with \na current ripple at the switching frequency that de-\npends on the output filter design, which is not a matter \nof study in this paper. Moreover, the voltage across the \nstray capacitance has a sinusoidal component resulting \nin a low dv/dt, see Figure 17b. A low dv/dt means that \nthe leakage current will be low as the numerical results \nshown in Figure17c. Thus, the maximum peak that the \nleakage current reaches is around 100 mA that comply \nwith the standard DIN VDE 0126-1-1. Finally, in Figure \n18 the CMV is calculated for the proposed topology ba-\nsed in (1). As can be observed, the CMV is almost cons-\ntant, which verifies the calculus performed above.\nIn a PV system, the power conversion efficiency is \none of the most important parameters that must be con-\nsidered in the design of the power converter.

Hence an evaluation of the efficiency for the three \ntopologies exposed in this paper is carried out.\nThe power losses were evaluated by using PSIM-\nThermal Module. Equation (12) is used to calculate the \nconduction losses in a diode when it is conducting con-\ntinuously. When the diode is conducting periodically \nwith an on duty cycle of D, the conduction losses are \ncalculated using equation (13).\nConduction losses = V\nd * IF  (12)\nConduction losses = Vd * IF * D (13)\nwhere Vd is the diode voltage drop and I F is the diode \nforward current.\nThe turn-on losses in the case of a diode are neglec-\nted. The turn-off losses due to the reverse recovery \neffect in the diode are calculated using equation (14) or \nequation (15),\n  (14)\n  (15)\nwhere Err is the reverse recovery energy losses, Qrr is the \nreverse recovery charge, f is the switching frequency VR \nis the actual reverse blocking voltage, and V R_datasheet is \nthe reverse blocking voltage in the E rr characteristic of \nthe datasheet, defined as “Reverse blocking voltage VR \n(V)” in the test conditions.\nThe Q\nrr can be defined by equation (16) as:\nQrr = 1/2 * trr * Irr  (16)\nWhenever Err is given in the datasheet, the losses will be \ncalculated based on Err, if Err is not given, the losses will \nbe calculated based on Qrr, if Qrr is not given, the losses \nwill be calculated based on t rr  and Irr, if both are no gi-\nven the losses will be treated as 0.\nIn the case of an IGBT the conduction losses are cal-\nculated by using equation (17) when the transistor is \nconducting continuously. When the transistor is con-\nducting periodically, then the losses are calculated ba-\nsed on the duty cycle D using equation (18).\nTransistor Conduction losses = V\nce (sat) * IC (17)\nTransistor Conduction losses = Vce (sat) * IC * D (18)\nwhere Vce(sat) is the collector-emisor saturation voltage \nand IC is the collector current. \nThe switching losses during the turn-on and turn-off  \ntransitions are calculated with equations (19) and (20) \nrespectively.\nTransistor turn−on losses = E\non * f * (19)\nTransistor turn−off losses = Eoff * f *  (20)\nwhere Eon and Eoff are the turn-on and turn-off energy \nlosses respectively, f is the switching frequency, V cc is \nthe actual dc bus voltage, and Vcc_datasheet is the dc bus vol-\ntage in the E on and E off characteristics of the datasheet, \ndefined as “dc bus voltage (V)” in the test conditions. \nThe power losses in the case of the antiparallel diode in \nthe IGBT are calculated as in the case of the discrete \ndiode explained above.\nThe IGBT used to evaluate the switching and conduc-\ntion losses was the IPM75DSA120 with 1200V and 75A of \nrated voltage and current respectively. The IGBT model \nwas loaded in the database of PSIM using the manu-  \nfacturer’s datasheet. The calculated efficiency provided \nby PSIM only considers the power losses in the semicon-\nductors which are the devices where the major power \nlosses occur. Moreover, in order to consider the power \nlosses behavior under different operating conditions, the \npower reference was set for different injected power le-\nvels giving the results summarized in the plots shown in \nFigure 19.\nAs it can be observed, the proposed inverter has a si-\nmilar performance than the commercial topologies re-\ngarding efficiency. However, it can be seen that in the \ncase of the proposed topology the efficiency is a bit hig-\nher than the efficiency of the HERIC topology. This is \nbecause the proposed topology does not use additional \ndiodes in the implementation of the bidirectional switch.\nFurthermore, the power losses in each IGBT can be \ncalculated to determine how the power losses are dis-\ntributed among all power switches. In Figure 20, the \ndistribution losses for the three transformerless topolo-\ngies exposed in this paper are depicted.

In the case of Figure \n20b, which is the case of HERIC topology, the power \nlosses are quiet balanced for all the switches. In terms of \nthermal design, this topology has a better performance \nthan the H5 topology, because in this case, all the swit-\nches are operating more or less at same temperature. It \ncan be noticed that there is an extra bar (D) which co-\nrresponds to the power losses in the diodes used in the \nbidirectional switch. Finally, in the case of the proposed \ntopology, which is depicted in Figure 20c, the distribu-\ntion power losses is close to the case of HERIC topolo-\ngy, but in this case, the losses in the diodes D5 and D6 \ndo not appear. Therefore in the case of the proposed \ntopology the thermal design can be performed in a sim-\npler way and at a lower cost.\nConclusions\nTransformerless photovoltaic converters offer higher \nefficiency than those that use a transformer as an isola-\ntion stage. A problem regarding generated common \nmode voltage arises when the galvanic isolation is \nomitted in the power conversion system. In general, the \ncommon mode voltage behavior is determined by the \ntopology structure and its PWM strategy. The varia-\ntions in the common mode voltage impact significantly \nthe leakage current through the stray capacitance of the \nPV module. In order to reduce or eliminate the leakage \ncurrents, a topology has been proposed in this paper.\nThe proposed topology is based in the HERIC in-\nverter, where an alternative bidirectional switch is im-\nplemented using only two IGBTs instead of two IGBTs \nand the two diodes that uses the HERIC topology. The \nproposed topology was simulated using the proposed \nbidirectional switch and it was compared with two \npopular transformerless topologies regarding ground \ncurrents and efficiency. The modulation strategy im-\nplemented in the simulations of the topologies is ba-\nsed on the classical unipolar sinusoidal pulse width \nmodulation, which provides a voltage such that the \nfiltering requirements are less demanding. In the case \nof the ground current behavior, the three topologies \nhave a similar performance being a low leakage cu-\nrrent the common characteristic that complies with \nthe requirements defined in the standard DIN VDE \n0126-1-1. However, in the case of the efficiency, the si-\nmulation results show that for power levels between 1 \nkW and 2 kW, the proposed topology has a lower effi-\nciency than H5 and HERIC topologies. Nonetheless, \nfor power levels between 2 kW and 6 kW, the efficien-\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000\n97\n97.5\n98\n98.5\n99\nEfficiency [%]\nPower [W]\nEfficiency Analysis\n \nH5\nProposed\nHERIC\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S5\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80Losess [W]\nSwitch Number\nDistribution Losess for H5 Topology\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6 D\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80Losess [W]\nSwitch Number\nDistribution Losess for HERIC Topology\nS1 S2 S3 S4 S5 S6\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80Losess [W]\nSwitch Number\nDistribution Losess for the Proposed Topology\na)\nb)\nc)\nFigure\t20.\t\tDistribution\tof\tpower\tlosses\tamong\tswitches\tin\tthe\t\nthree\ttopologies\nFigure\t19.\t\tComparison\tof\tefficiency\tfor\tH5,\tHERIC\tand\t\nproposed\ttopology\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.riit.2015.03.002\n18 3\nVázquez-Guzmán Gerardo, Martínez-Rodríguez Pánfilo Raymundo, Sosa-Zúñiga José Miguel\nIngeniería Inves tigación y Tecnolo gía, volumen XVI (número 2), abril-junio 2015: 173-1 84 ISSN 2594-0732 FI-UNAM\ncy is similar between the proposed topology and the \nH5 topology, while HERIC topology presents the lowest \nefficiency for this interval. Notice that most of the com-\nmercial PV inverters for low power applications are on \nthe set of 2 kW to 10 kW.\nIn this paper a transformerless topology was intro-\nduced which focuses in providing an alternative solu-\ntion for the bidirectional switch implemented as an \nac-decoupling. The numerical results show that the \nCMV of the proposed topology remains almost cons-\ntant along the grid period. On the other hand, the effi-\nciency of the proposed topology can be competitive \nwith the popular ones. Therefore, it can be concluded \nthat the proposed topology can be a very attractive so-\nlution for the PV transformerless applications.\nReferences\nBarater-Buticchi D., Crinto G., Franceschini A., Lorenzani G.
