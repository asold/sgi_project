How-\never, comparing the results of different metrics\nand the works that evaluate with such metrics\nremains difﬁcult, if not outright impossible.\nWe survey the literature on fairness metrics for\npre-trained language models and experimen-\ntally evaluate compatibility, including both bi-\nases in language models and in their down-\nstream tasks. We do this by combining tra-\nditional literature survey, correlation analysis\nand empirical evaluations. We ﬁnd that many\nmetrics are not compatible with each other and\nhighly depend on (i) templates, (ii) attribute\nand target seeds and (iii) the choice of embed-\ndings. We also see no tangible evidence of in-\ntrinsic bias relating to extrinsic bias. These re-\nsults indicate that fairness or bias evaluation re-\nmains challenging for contextualized language\nmodels, among other reasons because these\nchoices remain subjective. To improve fu-\nture comparisons and fairness evaluations, we\nrecommend to avoid embedding-based metrics\nand focus on fairness evaluations in down-\nstream tasks.\n1 Introduction\nWith the popularization of word embeddings by\nworks such as Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013),\nGLoVe (Pennington et al., 2014) and, more re-\ncently, contextualized variants such as ELMo (Pe-\nters et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019),\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) has seen sig-\nniﬁcant growth and advancement. Word embed-\ndings and later language models have been adopted\nby many applications. Many of these embeddings\nhave been probed by researchers for biases such as\ngender stereotypes.\nWord embeddings are generally trained on real-\nworld data such that they model statistical proper-\nties from the training data. Hence, they pick up\nbiases and stereotypes that are typically present\nin the data (Garrido-Mu ˜noz et al., 2021). Al-\nthough Kurita et al. (2019) and Webster et al. (2020)\nopine that this can pose signiﬁcant challenges in\ndownstream applications, this view has been ques-\ntioned, especially for non-contextualized word em-\nbeddings (Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2021).\nEarly works such as Bolukbasi et al. (2016);\nCaliskan et al. (2017); Gonen and Goldberg (2019)\nwidely explored fairness in non-contextualized em-\nbedding methods. In non-contextualized embed-\ndings such as Word2vec and GLoVe embeddings,\nmodels are trained to generate vectors that map\ndirectly to dictionary words and hence are inde-\npendent of the context in which the word is used.\nIn contrast, contextualized word embeddings take\npolysemy (words could have multiple meanings,\ne.g. ‘ a stick ’ vs ‘let’s stick to’) into considera-\ntion. Thus different embeddings are generated for\na given word depending on the context in which\nit appears. Because of such differences between\nthe two approaches, popular techniques for detect-\ning and measuring bias in non-contextualized word\nembeddings, such as WEAT (Caliskan et al., 2017),\ndo not apply naturally to contextualized variants.\nMany techniques have been proposed to mea-\nsure bias in contextualized word embeddings, ei-\nther as a standalone method (May et al., 2019; Bartl\net al., 2020) or as an additional contribution to eval-\nuate fairness interventions (Webster et al., 2020;\nLauscher et al., 2021; Kurita et al., 2019). This\nbroad selection of methods makes it difﬁcult for\nNLP practitioners to select an appropriate and reli-\nable set of metrics to quantify bias and to compare\nresults. This is further exacerbated as these quan-\ntifying techniques also involve different choices\nfor attribute and target words, commonly jointly\nreferred to as seed words, templates for context,\nand different methods for measuring similarity.\nIn this paper, we combine literature survey and\nexperimental comparisons to compare fairness met-\n1693\nrics for contextualized language models. We are\nguided by the following research questions:\n• Which fairness measures exist for contextu-\nalized language models such as BERT? (Sec-\ntion 3)\n• What challenges do languages other than En-\nglish pose? (§ 3.3)\n• What are the relationships between fairness\nmeasures, the templates these measures use,\nembedding methods, and intrinsic vs extrinsic\nmeasures? (Section 4)\n• Which set of measures do we recommended\nto evaluate language resources? (Section 7)\n2 Background\nStatic word embeddings have typically been used\nwith recurrent neural networks (RNNs), option-\nally with an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al.,\n2014). The transformer architecture (Vaswani\net al., 2017) introduced a new paradigm relying\nonly on attention, which proved faster and more\naccurate than RNNs and did not rely on static\nword embeddings. The transformer consists of\ntwo stacks of attention layers, the encoder and the\ndecoder, with each layer consisting of multiple par-\nallel attention heads. BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)\nis based on the encoder from this transformer and\nobtained state-of-the-art results for multiple NLP\ntasks using transfer learning with a pre-training\nstep and a second ﬁnetuning step.\nThe pre-training task is to reconstruct missing\nwords in a sentence, called masked language\nmodeling (MLM), which helps capture interesting\nsemantics. The training objective for a model\nwith parameters θ is to predict the the original\ntoken on the position of a randomly masked token\nxm based on the positional-dependent context\nx/m = x0,...,x m−1,xm+1,...,x N, following\nmaxθ\n∑N\ni=1 1xi=x/m log\n(\nP\n(\nxi |x/m; θ\n))\nwith\n1xi=x/m as indicator function. After training, the\nlanguage model can infer the probability that\na token occurs on the masked position. As an\nillustration with the original BERT model, the\nsentence ‘[MASK]is a doctor.’ is ﬁlled in with\nthe token ‘He’ (62%), followed by ‘She’ (32%).\nBecause the MLM task relies on co-occurrences,\nthis example illustrates how this task captures\nstereotypes that are present in pre-training datasets,\nwhich is referred to as intrinsic bias.\nPre-trained model\ne.g. BERT\nPretraining corpora\ne.g. OSCAR, Wiki, ... \nIntrinsic biases\nFinetuned model\ne.g. BERT\nExtrinsic biases\nTransfer \nlearning\n[CLS]\nDownsteam tasks\ne.g. NER, coref., POS\nFigure 1: Illustration of the transfer learning paradigm\nwhere a language model is ﬁrst pre-trained on one\ndataset and afterwards ﬁnetuned on another dataset.\nBoth stages can introduce biases.\nAs a second step, this pre-trained model can be\nﬁnetuned on a new task, most commonly either\nsentence classiﬁcation, which uses the contextu-\nalized embeddings of the ﬁrst token x0 = [CLS],\nor token classiﬁcation, for which the embeddings\nof each respective token position are used. These\nembeddings are obtained from output states of the\npenultimate layer, after which a single linear layer\nis added and trained. This ﬁnetuning is typically\ndone with different datasets that are labeled for\nthe task at hand and here we can observe extrin-\nsic bias with allocational harms (Goldfarb-Tarrant\net al., 2021; Blodgett et al., 2020), e.g. gender\nimbalances in co-reference resolution (see § 3.2).\nMany models improved on the original BERT\narchitecture and training setup, e.g. RoBERTa (Liu\net al., 2019) was trained on signiﬁcantly more\ndata for a longer period and without a second pre-\ntraining objective, next sentence prediction. AL-\nBERT (Lan et al., 2019) used parameter sharing\nbetween attention layers to obtain a smaller model\nwithout signiﬁcant performance degradation. Sanh\net al. (2019) also created a smaller BERT varia-\ntion, DistilBERT, by using knowledge distillation.\nAll these models are MLMs, so this gives us the\nopportunity to compare bias metrics across models.\n2.1 Fairness in word embeddings\nFairness in machine learning has a long standing\nhistory and a general introduction is out of scope\nfor this paper, so we refer the reader to Barocas\net al. (2019).Typical metrics, e.g. demographic par-\nity, are not directly applicable to tasks dealing with\nnatural language. Furthermore, many NLP applica-\ntions ﬁnetune existing language models, which in-\ntertwines extrinsic and intrinsic biases as discussed\nearlier in Section 2.\n1694\nEarly methods for evaluating bias in non-\ncontextualized embeddings like Word2vec, are\nWEAT (Caliskan et al., 2017) and a direct bias\nmetric (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). The latter demon-\nstrated that word embeddings contain a (lin-\near) biased subspace, where for example ‘ man’\nand ‘woman’ can be projected on the same gen-\nder axis as ‘computer programmer’ and ‘home-\nmaker’ (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). These analogies\nare calculated using cosine distance between vec-\ntors to deﬁne similarity and also to evaluate the\nauthors’ proposed debiasing strategies. In addi-\ntion, pairs of gendered words were also evaluated\nusing Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This\nshowed that most of the variance stemming from\ngender could be attributed to a single principal com-\nponent (Bolukbasi et al., 2016).\nIn parallel, the Word Embeddings Association\nTest (WEAT; Caliskan et al., 2017) was devel-\noped based on the Implicit Association Tests (IAT;\nGreenwald et al., 1998) from social sciences.\nWEAT measures associations between two sets of\ntarget words X,Y, e.g. male and female names,\nand another two sets of attribute words A,B, e.g.\ncareer and family-related words, following\ns(X,Y,A,B) =\n∑\nx∈X\nu(x,A,B)−\n∑\ny∈Y\nu(y,A,B)\nwith a similarity measure u(x,A,B)1 that mea-\nsures the association between one word embedding\nx and the word vectors of attributes a ∈A,b ∈\nB, deﬁned as (x,A,B) = meana∈Acos (x,a) −\nmeanb∈Bcos (x,b). This method relies on a vector\nrepresentation for each word and by providing a\nrepresentation from a contextualized model, WEAT\ncan also be adapted for contextualized language\nmodels, which we discuss in Section 3 and § 4.3.\n3 Measuring fairness in language models\n3.1 Intrinsic measures\nDiscovery of Correlations (DisCo). Webster\net al. (2020) presented an intrinsic measure Dis-\ncovery of Correlations (DisCo) that uses templates\nwith two slots such as ‘ likes to [MASK].’, we\nprovide a complete list in § A.1. The ﬁrst slot ( )\nis ﬁlled with words based on a set of e.g. ﬁrst\nnames or nouns related to professions. The sec-\nond masked slot is ﬁlled in by the language model\n1Caliskan et al. (2017) originally used s(x, A, B).\nand the three top predictions are kept. If these pre-\ndictions differ between sets, this is considered an\nindication of bias. Lauscher et al. (2021) slightly\nmodiﬁed this method by ﬁltering predictions with\nP(xm |T) >0.1 instead of the top-three items.\nLog Probability Bias Score (LPBS).This bias\nscore presented by Kurita et al. (2019) is a template-\nbased method that is similar to DisCo,but also cor-\nrects for the prior probability of the target attribute,\nas for example the token ‘ He’ commonly has a\nhigher prior than ‘She’.The reasoning is that correc-\ntion ensures that any measured difference between\nattributes can be attributed to the attribute and not\nto the prior of this token. Bartl et al. (2020) in-\ntroduced an alternative dataset speciﬁcally for this\nevaluation method, called bias evaluation corpus\nwith professions (BEC-Pro), with templates and\nseeds in both English and German. We will revisit\nthe German results in § 3.3.\nSentence Embedding Association Test (SEAT).\nA limitation of WEAT (Caliskan et al., 2017) is\nthat the method does not work directly on contex-\ntualized word embeddings, which SEAT solves by\nusing context templates (May et al., 2019). These\ntemplates are semantically bleached, so there are\nno words in there that affect bias measurements,\nfor instance ‘ is a [MASK]. ’We will investigate\nthis concept further in § 4.2.\nThese templates are used to extract an embed-\nding to measure the mean cosine distance between\ntwo sets of attributes, after which WEAT is ap-\nplied as discussed in § 2.1. This embedding is\nobtained from the [CLS] token in BERT. May\net al. (2019) implemented three tests from WEAT.\nIn addition, the authors also made new tests for\ndouble binds (Stone and Lovejoy, 2004) and angry\nBlack woman stereotypes. An approach inspired by\nSEAT was taken by Lauscher et al. (2021) using to-\nken embeddings from the ﬁrst four attention layers\ninstead of the [CLS] embedding in the last layer,\nfollowing Vulic et al. (2020). Tan and Celis (2019)\nalso adapted SEAT by relying on the embedding\nof the token of interest in the last layer, instead of\nthe [CLS] token. We will discuss these different\nembedding methods in § 4.3.\nContextualized Embedding Association Test\n(CEAT). Another extension of WEAT (Caliskan\net al., 2017) was presented by Guo and Caliskan\n(2021). CEAT uses Reddit data (up to 9 tokens)\nas context templates, which provide more realistic\n1695\nTable 1: Overview of intrinsic measures of bias for language models. For brevity, we include most templates in\nAppendix A and address differences between templates in § 4.2. We also discuss the evaluation types (§ 3.1) and\nembedding types (§ 4.3). We also indicate if data and source code are both available ( v), or if only a dataset is\navailable ( f s), or if neither is publicly available ( f).

This extension provides a\ncontextualized equivalent for all WEAT tests.\nContext Association Test (CAT).Nadeem et al.\n(2021) created StereoSet, a dataset with stereotypes\nwith regard to professions, gender, race, and reli-\ngion. Based on this dataset, a score, CAT, is cal-\nculated that reﬂects (i) how often stereotypes are\npreferred over anti-stereotypes and (ii) how well\nthe language model predicts meaningful instead of\nmeaningless associations. Blodgett et al. (2021)\ncall attention to many ambiguities, assumptions,\nand data issues that are present in this dataset.\nCrowS-Pairs. CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020)\ntakes a similar approach as SteroSet/CAT,\nbut the evaluation is based on pseudo-log-\nlikelihood (Salazar et al., 2020) to calculate a\nperplexity-based metric of all tokens in a sentence\nconditioned on the stereotypical tokens (e.g. ‘He’).\nAll samples consist of pairs of sentences where one\nhas been modiﬁed to contain either a stereotype or\nan anti-stereotype. ALBERT and RoBERTa both\nhad better scores compared to BERT, but these ﬁnd-\nings might be limited, since this dataset also has\ndata quality issues (Blodgett et al., 2021).\nAll Unmaksed Likelihood (AUL).Kaneko and\nBollegala (2021) modify the above CrowS-Pairs\nmeasure to consider multiple correct predictions,\ninstead of only testing if the target tokens are pre-\ndicted. In addition, the authors also argue against\nevaluations biases using [MASK] tokens, since\nthese tokens are not used in downstream tasks.\nPCA-based methods. Both Basta et al. (2019);\nZhao et al. (2019) analyzed gender subspaces in\nELMo using a method that is very similar to Boluk-\nbasi et al. (2016). This approach was then applied\nto BERT-based models (Sedoc and Ungar, 2019).\nWe do not further compare to these methods, since\nthey are less suited to obtain numerical bias scores\nas they rely on identifying a unique gender axis.\n3.2 Extrinsic measures\nExtrinsic measures are used to measure how bias\npropagates in downstream tasks such as occupation\nprediction and coreference resolution. These typ-\nically involve ﬁnetuning the pre-trained language\nmodel on a downstream task and subsequently eval-\nuating its performance with regard to sensitive at-\ntributes such as gender and race. As elsewhere in\nthe bias literature, most evaluations focus on gender\nbias due to the relative availability of gender-related\ndatasets and the relatively widespread concern for\ngender-related biases.\nBiasInBios. De-Arteaga et al. (2019) developed\nan English dataset as a classiﬁcation benchmark for\nmeasuring bias in language models, which has been\nadopted as an extrinsic measure (Webster et al.,\n2020; Zhao et al., 2020). The task is to predict\nprofessions based on biographies of people. Bias\nis quantiﬁed as the true positive rate difference be-\ntween male and female proﬁles. We will investigate\nBiasInBios as a fairness metric in (§ 4.4).\nWinograd schemas. The Winograd schema\n(Levesque et al., 2012), originally designed to test\n1696\nmachine intelligence based on anaphora resolution,\nhas been adapted in various works into benchmark\ndatasets for bias evaluation. These benchmark\ndatasets have nuances that make them suitable for\nmeasuring biases in different scenarios and con-\ntexts (Rudinger et al., 2018). Prominent among\nthese are WinoBias (Zhao et al., 2018), Winogen-\nder (Rudinger et al., 2018) and WinoGrande (Sak-\naguchi et al., 2021). GAP (Webster et al., 2018) is\nanother benchmark dataset which closely relates\nto the Winograd family. It has also been used to\nmeasure bias in pronoun resolution methods.\nThe WinoBias dataset covers 40 occupations and\nis used to measure the ability of a language model\nto resolve coreferencing of gender pronouns (fe-\nmale and male) in the context of pro-stereotype\nand anti-stereotype jobs. A pro-stereotype setting\nis when, for instance, a male pronoun is linked\nto a male-dominated job, whereas a female pro-\nnoun being linked to that same job will be an anti-\nstereotype. E.g. Pro-stereotype: [The janitor]\nreprimanded the accountant because [he] got less\nallowance. Anti-stereotype: [The janitor] rep-\nrimanded the accountant because [she] got less\nallowance. The usual approach is to adapt the lan-\nguage model to the OntoNotes dataset (Weischedel\net al., 2013). A model is said to pass the WinoBias\ntest if resolution is done with the same level of per-\nformance for pro-stereotype and anti-stereotype in-\nstances. This is quantiﬁed with an F1 score for two\ntypes of sentences, of which type 1 is the most chal-\nlenging because resolution relies on world knowl-\nedge (Rudinger et al., 2018). Using this approach,\nde Vassimon Manela et al. (2021) extended Wino-\nBias to include skew towards one gender, follow-\ning 1\n2 (|Ffpro\n1 −Fmpro\n1 |+ |Ffanti\n1 −Fmanti\n1 |) . In\n(§ 4.4), we will also investigate WinoBias (type 1)\nand the skew variant as implemented by de Vassi-\nmon Manela et al. (2021).\n3.3 Measuring biases in other languages\nMany languages have some sort of grammatical\ngender, which can interfere with fairness evalua-\ntion metrics presented in § 3.1 that focus mostly\non gender stereotyping by measuring associations.\nThe assumption is that there should be no associa-\ntion between e.g. professions and gender. However,\nthese associations can be expected in gendered lan-\nguages. We provide a brief overview of some meth-\nods that address languages beyond English.\nDelobelle et al. (2020) and Ch ´avez Mulsa and\nSpanakis (2020) evaluated RobBERT, a Dutch lan-\nguage model. Delobelle et al. (2020) did this vi-\nsually with three templates (§ A.5). Associations\nbetween gendered pronouns and professions were\nnot considered an indicator of bias, since this is\nexpected in Dutch. Instead, a prior towards male\npronouns was viewed as an indication, contrasting\nwith LPBS (Kurita et al., 2019).\nFor German, Bartl et al. (2020) evaluated BEC-\nPro. The authors found that the scores for male\nand female professions were very similar, likely\nbecause of the gender system.\nFinally, Nozza et al. (2021) presented a multi-\nlingual approach using HurtLex (Bassignana et al.,\n2018), focusing on six European languages (En-\nglish, Italian, French, Portuguese, Romanian, and\nSpanish) with BERT and GPT-2. Both models repli-\ncated multiple stereotypes and reproduced deroga-\ntory words across languages, leading the authors to\nquestion the suitability for public deployment.\n4 On the compatibility of measures\nIn this section, our goal is to objectively investigate\nthe consistency in indicating bias between various\ntechniques used by previous works. As mentioned\nearlier, besides the metric choice, three primary fac-\ntors are important when measuring intrinsic bias in\nan embedding model: (i) choice of seed words, (ii)\nchoice of templates and (iii) how representations\nfor seed words are generated.\nRecent works investigating bias in language\nmodels have found issues with inconsistencies be-\ntween seed words (Antoniak and Mimno, 2021),\nunvoiced assumptions and data quality issues in\nStereoSet and CrowS-Pairs templates (Blodgett\net al., 2021), and issues with semantically bleached\ntemplates (Tan and Celis, 2019). These issues raise\nsome questions for the remaining two factors, for\nexample whether or not the choice of template and\ntechnique for selecting embeddings to represent\nseed words matters in measuring bias? And are\n“semantically bleached” templates really semanti-\ncally bleached? Meaning, do they not affect bias\nmeasurements? Or in the extreme, can bias in em-\nbedding model stay hidden by picking the “wrong”\ntemplates or representations? These are questions\nwe seek to answer with a series of experimental\nanalysis where we measure correlations between\nvarious approaches to test if these templates and\nrepresentations measure the same bias.\n1697\n1.00 0.55 0.67 0.49 0.51\n1.00 0.78 0.60 0.54 0.46\n1.00\n1.00 0.67 0.59 0.66 0.53\n1.00 0.78\n1.00 0.55\n1.00 −0.48 0.50 −0.45 −0.57\n1.00 0.50\n1.00\n1.00 0.59\n1.00\n0.28 0.42 −0.33 −0.12 0.18 0.37\n0.22 −0.11 0.44 0.14 0.42\n0.13 −0.17 −0.07 −0.25 0.39 −0.02 0.29 0.16\n−0.18 0.43 0.04\n0.04 0.38 0.27 0.34 0.34\n−0.19 0.05 0.16 0.23\n0.05 0.28\n−0.39 −0.20\n−1.0\n−0.8\n−0.6\n−0.4\n−0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nT1\nT2\nT3\nT4\nT5\nT6\nT7\nT8\nT9\nT10\nT11\nT1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 T10 T11\nCorrelations between templates\n(a) [CLS] embedding\n1.00 0.97 0.81 0.90 0.63 0.83 0.85 0.75\n1.00 0.88 0.87 0.54 0.85 0.82 0.83\n1.00 0.73 0.47 0.86 0.71 0.92\n1.00 0.62 0.81 0.73 0.85 0.69 0.51\n1.00 0.87 0.57 0.52\n1.00 0.46 0.75 0.52\n1.00 0.62 0.86\n1.00 0.61\n1.00\n1.00 0.56\n1.00\n0.36 0.23 −0.10\n0.23 0.18 −0.09\n0.06 0.24 −0.11\n0.24\n0.10 0.0 0.34\n0.32 0.24\n0.24 −0.18\n0.27 0.03\n0.29 −0.14\n−1.0\n−0.8\n−0.6\n−0.4\n−0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nT1\nT2\nT3\nT4\nT5\nT6\nT7\nT8\nT9\nT10\nT11\nT1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 T7 T8 T9 T10 T11\nCorrelations between templates (b) Target token embedding\nFigure 2: Correlation of templates as listed in Table 2 when using two different embedding approaches, namely the\n[CLS] (Figure 2a) and the pooled target token embeddings (Figure 2b). Different embeddings result in different\nresults, which we discuss further in § 4.3. The Pearson correlation coefﬁcients in bold are signiﬁcant at the\nα= 0.05 level.\n4.1 Methodology\nWe conduct correlation analyses between differ-\nent templates (§ 4.2) and between representation\nmethods (§ 4.3), as well as between measures them-\nselves (§ 4.4). To create a context and to help draw\nconcise conclusions, we focus all our experiments\non binary gender bias with respect to professions.\nFor the correlation analyses between templates\nand representation methods, we vary our seed\nwords by creating subsets and we keep the lan-\nguage model (BERT-base-uncased) constant.\nWe start by compiling the sets of attribute words\n(professions) and target words (gendered words)\nfollowing Caliskan et al. (2017) and Zhao et al.\n(2018), which are split in two sets of male and\nfemale “stereotyped” professions (§ B.1) and we\ncreate female and male sets of target words (§ B.2).\nWe generate 20 subsets {a1,...,a 20}by randomly\nsampling 10 professions for each set of attributes,\nthus for male and female professions (see § B.1 for\nthe full list). We expect that some subsets will show\nhigher levels of bias than others and that given two\n“accurate” fairness metrics M1 and M2, if M1 in-\ndicates that a1 contains less bias than a2 which in\nturn contains less bias thana3, M2 should likewise\nindicate bias for the three subsets. Caliskan et al.\n(2017); May et al. (2019); Lauscher et al. (2021);\nTan and Celis (2019) used a similar approach to\ncalculate distributional properties and quantify the\nvariance.In our experiments, we use Pearson corre-\nlation coefﬁcients.\nFor the third correlation experiment between fair-\nness metrics ( § 4.4), we use ﬁve language mod-\nels, where the different language models replace\nthe need for subsets. We assume that different\nlanguage models have different levels of biases,\nbecause of different training setups on different\ndatasets, which was observed for metrics that were\nevaluated on multiple models (Nangia et al., 2020).\nWe also use the templates and seed words for each\nmetric as described in the original papers, since we\ncompare the metrics as they are used.\n4.2 Compatibility between templates\nThe choice of template for creating contexts for\nseed words plays a very important role in measur-\ning bias in contextual word embeddings. Many\npapers propose the use of “semantically bleached”\nsentence templates for context which should con-\ntain no semantic meaning so that the embedding\ngenerated by inserting a seed word into such a tem-\nplate should only represent the seed word. May\net al. (2019); Tan and Celis (2019) indicated that\nsemantically bleached templates might still contain\nsome semantics, at least related to the bias.\nIf these templates are semantically bleached with\nregard to a gender bias, all these templates should\nhave a high correlation with other bleached tem-\nplates. We test the bleached SEAT templates (May\net al., 2019), listed in Table 2 (T1 −T8). We also\ncompare with the masked template of used by Ku-\nrita et al. (2019) for their SEAT implementation\n(T9), and add 2 semantically unbleached templates\nfrom Tan and Celis (2019) (T10 −T11) as control\ntemplates. We test both the [CLS] embedding as\n1698\nTable 2: Templates used in our evaluation of the com-\npatibility between templates. The last column provides\nthe result of our experiment on relative entropy, where\nwe measure the distance between all templates and tem-\nplate T1, a lower divergence means a more similar tem-\nplate.

(2019) and the\ntarget token embedding (Tan and Celis, 2019).\nWe test our hypothesis with a correlation anal-\nysis as described in § 4.1 and we additionally test\nhow the distribution differs between templates. We\noperationalize semantically bleached templates as\ntwo templates T1,T2 having the same contextual-\nized probability for a set of tokens on position xm,\nfollowing P(xm |T1) =P(xm |T2) .\nTo quantify the distance between both distribu-\ntions, we calculate relative entropy (Kullback and\nLeibler, 1951) between every template and tem-\nplate T1, which we expect to be lower for the se-\nmantically bleached templates compared to the un-\nbleached templates. We perform this relative en-\ntropy experiment twice: (i) once with all tokens\nin the model’s vocabulary and (ii) once with a set\nof gendered tokens (see § B.2). Both sets aim to\nevaluate how the contextualized distributions of\nthe masked token ti = P(xm |Ti) differ, but we\nexpect a lower divergence in particular for the gen-\ndered subset. Figure 2a and Table 2 present our\nresults for the correlation analysis and difference in\ndistributions, where we make three observations.\nFirstly, the choice of “semantically bleached”\ntemplate could signiﬁcantly vary the measure of\nbias. Although templates T1 −T9 are all bleached,\nthere are weak and sometimes even negative corre-\nlations (e.g. T7). The fact that we do not get (close\nto) perfect correlation among these templates con-\nﬁrms the observation made by May et al. (2019)\non the possible impact that “semantically bleached”\ntemplates could have on fairness evaluations.\nSecondly, semantically and syntactically similar\n1.00 0.68\n1.00 0.45 0.59 0.53 0.45\n1.00 0.69 0.90 0.72\n1.00 0.75 0.73\n1.00 0.79\n1.00\n0.32 0.21 0.22 0.34\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n[CLS]-no context\n[CLS]-templates\nFirst-templates\nPooled-no context\nPooled-templates\nVulic et al.

The Pearson\ncorrelation coefﬁcients in bold are signiﬁcant at the\nα= 0.05 level.\ntemplates do not necessarily correlate strongly. E.g.\n“There is the . ”(T3) and “The is there. ”(T6) con-\ntain the same words which are believed to carry no\nrelevant information, yet the correlation is lower.\nThirdly, the distributional distances between\nT1 and all other templates, as measured by the\nKullback-Leiber divergence and shown in Table 2,\nhighlight that the different templates are indeed not\ncompletely semantically bleached. However, this\ndeﬁnition does have some merit, as the distance is\nsigniﬁcantly less for all than bleached sentences\nthe two unbleached sentences.\nBased on the above observations, we conclude\nthat semantically bleached templates need to be\nused cautiously, and any results stemming from the\nuse of such templates cannot be objectively main-\ntained so long as there does not exist a standardized\nand validated scheme of selecting such templates.\n4.3 Compatibility between representations\nWord representations or embeddings could also be\na source of inconsistency in evaluating contextual-\nized language models. Since many techniques use\ntemplates, it is natural to use the entire sentence\nrepresentation as the representation of the word\nin question, e.g. by mean-pooling over all target\ntokens or using the [CLS] embedding. We test\nthese methods and some additional combinations\nthat have been used in the literature, yet not nec-\nessarily for bias evaluations.

The\ncorrelations between these embedding methods are\nvisualized in Figure 3, where we see a weak cor-\nrelation between techniques that select the [CLS]\nembedding as the representation of the seed word\nand the other techniques. The weak correlation\namong the [CLS] techniques themselves conﬁrms\nthe claim that semantically bleached contexts have\nsigniﬁcant inﬂuence on the word representation.\nUsing the [CLS] embedding as the representation\nof seed words may not be an accurate representa-\ntion since it captures information from the context,\nmeaning the templates are evidently not as seman-\ntically bleached as one would imagine.\nSecondly, we explore how other embedding se-\nlection methods withstand semantic inﬂuence from\nthe context/templates. Tan and Celis (2019) pro-\npose using the contextual word representation of\nthe token of interest instead of [CLS]. We inves-\ntigate the effectiveness of this approach by repli-\ncating the experiment in Figure 2a. The results\non the correlations between template types show\nthat using only the embeddings of the target word\n(Figure 2b) produces more consistent results than\nusing the [CLS] embedding as the representation\n(Figure 2a). Thus, using only the embeddings of\nthe target word produces more stable results across\ntemplates and is more resilient to a context that\nmay not be semantically bleached, which justiﬁes\nthe embedding approach of Tan and Celis (2019).\n4.4 Compatibility between metrics\nIn this section, our goal is to (i) see if there is a\ngeneral relationship between intrinsic and extrinsic\nbias measures and (ii) how individual bias metrics\ncorrelate with extrinsic bias. To do this, we test\nthree extrinsic metrics, BiasinBios (De-Arteaga\net al., 2019), WinoBias Zhao et al. (2018), and\nskew (de Vassimon Manela et al., 2021). and we\nevaluate ﬁve popular language models2. For Wino-\nBias, we adapt the models to the OntoNotes 5.0\ndataset (Weischedel et al., 2013), which is standard\npractice for WinoBias and we follow the training\nsetup of de Vassimon Manela et al. (2021).\nWe performed a correlation analysis between\nthe results of the three extrinsic measures and a\nset of intrinsic fairness measures from Section 3;\nthe results are presented in Figure 4. We observe\nthat most correlations with the extrinsic BiasInBios\nmeasure are negative—which is expected since\nthis measure gives a higher score if more bias is\npresent—but still strongly correlated with some\nintrinsic measures, like a WEAT variant by Tan\nand Celis (2019). However, other measures, like\nCrowS-pairs (Nangia et al., 2020), correlate less\nwith two extrinsic measures, which we suspect to\nbe related to issues found by Blodgett et al. (2021),\nalthough more experiments are needed to conﬁrm\nthis. Part of these poor correlations are caused by\nthe differences in templates (§ 4.2) and representa-\ntions (§ 4.3) that we observed, but such differences\nremain worrisome.\n5 Code\nWe make the source code available and also publish\na package to bundle fairness metrics at https://\ngithub.com/iPieter/biased-rulers.\n6 Discussion and ethical considerations\nWe mostly compare one of the most frequently\nstudied settings, namely binary gender biases with\na focus on professions. Although most methods\nshould be extendable to non-binary settings and\nalso work for other biases, this is often not consid-\nered by the authors. Furthermore, different works\nalso consider different notions of gender and con-\nﬂate multiple notions (Cao and Daum´e III, 2020).\nBoth issues should be addressed in future works.\n2bert-base-uncased, bert-large-uncased,\nroberta-base, distilbert-base-uncased and\nbert-base-multilingual-uncased.\n1700\nWe also observed that CrowS-pairs correlates\nless with other extrinsic measures, which could be\ncaused by data issues (Blodgett et al., 2021). Future\nwork could test this hypothesis by comparing the\nCrowS-pairs dataset with a cleaned version where\nthose data issues are resolved. However, such a\nversion does currently not exist. Related to this,\nis the design of the templates. We observed ex-\ncessive variation between templates, similar to the\ndifferences between few-shot prompts that are used\nwith autoregressive models like GPT-2 (Lu et al.,\n2021). Future work could also focus on template\ndesigning and reﬁne the concept of semantically\nbleached templates.\nWith the availability of fairness metrics, we also\nrisk that such metrics are used as proof or as insur-\nance that the models are unbiased, although most\nmetrics can only be considered indicators of bias at\nmost (Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2021). We, therefore,\nurge practitioners to not rely on these metrics alone,\nbut also consider fairness in downstream tasks. We\nalso did not draw much attention to many other\nnegative impacts of language models that practi-\ntioners should consider, e.g. high energy usage\nor not including all stakeholders when training a\nlanguage model (Bender et al., 2021).\n7 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we presented an overview of fairness\nmetrics for contextualized language models and\nwe focused on which templates, embeddings and\nmeasures these metrics used. We evaluated how\nthese metrics correlate with each other, as well as\nhow parts of these metrics correlate. We found\nthat many aspects of intrinsic fairness metrics are\nincompatible, e.g. choosing different templates,\nembeddings, or even metrics. A common motiva-\ntion is that intrinsic biases can lead to stereotyping\naffecting downstream tasks, but we do not observe\nthis for current intrinsic and extrinsic measures.\nOur advice is to use a mix of some intrinsic\nmeasures of fairness that don’t use embeddings\ndirectly and eliminate one source of variance, for\nexample DisCo or LPBS, in addition to a measure\nlike Tan and Celis (2019) that seems to correlate\nwell with at least some notion of extrinsic bias.\nHowever, we also recommend to perform extrinsic\nfairness evaluations on downstream tasks, since\nthis is where actual resource allocations happen\nand where intrinsic and extrinsic biases collude.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Luc De Raedt for his continued support,\nJessa Bekker for her practical advice on writing\na survey, and Eva Vanmassenhove for sharing her\nknowledge on gender bias.
