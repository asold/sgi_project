Apparently smoking-related action\nrepresentations in smokers are stored in brain regions typically representing tool use skills and action knowledge. Most importantly,\ncortical and behavioral correlates of the respective drug-taking skills vary with the individual degree of nicotine dependence.\nIntroduction\nWith an estimated death toll of/H110225 million per year (World\nHealth Organization, 2008) nicotine dependence is the addiction\nwith the strongest impact on public health. While sophisticated\nmedical and psychotherapeutic treatments have contributed to a\ncertain increase in abstinence rates, even the most effective ap-\nproaches have long-term success rates of only/H1101130% (Piasecki,\n2006). While research has focused mainly on the reward system\nand craving, there is evidence that relapse into drug-taking be-\nhavior is not always related to conscious craving (Miller and\nGold, 1994). Instead, the high change resistance of smoking be-\nhavior might be attributable also to deeply embedded habitual\nprocesses, which are compulsive and almost automatic. From a\ncognitive point of view, these habitual mechanisms are encoded\nas automatized action schemata, which develop with repeated use\nand contain information underlying the efficient initiation and\nexecution of drug-taking behavior (Tiffany, 1990). These sche-\nmata can be triggered rapidly by smoking cues, thus increasing\nthe probability that smokers will perform substance-use actions\nindependently of intentional processes. It has been shown that\nsmoking behavior becomes automatized in frequent smokers\n(Baxter and Hinson, 2001; Field et al., 2006). Furthermore, recent\nsynaptic plasticity research has identified the dorsal striatum as\nthe region contributing to the establishment of persistent drug-\nrelated habits (Gerdeman et al., 2003). While the activation pat-\nterns in the dorsal striatum reflect the formation of powerful\nstimulus–response associations (Everitt and Robbins, 2005), very\nlittle is known about the neural substrates of the corresponding\ndrug-taking skills and action knowledge.\nThe present study explored the neural and behavioral corre-\nlates of drug-taking skills and smoking-related action knowledge\nin smokers and their associations with the individual degree of\nnicotine dependence. Smokers and nonsmokers were scanned\nwith functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while view-\ning smoking-related and control images. We hypothesized that\nsmoking-related but not control cues trigger the respective skill\nand action representations, which should be reflected by higher\nfMRI activations in smokers compared with nonsmokers in brain\nregions known to encode tool use skills and action knowledge.\nFurthermore, as automatized behavioral patterns are executed\nrelatively fast and efficiently once they are triggered (Tiffany,\n1990), we expected an increased behavioral responsiveness to\nsmoking-related objects in smokers compared with nonsmokers.\nTo assess behavioral responsiveness to both everyday and\nsmoking-related objects we used an orientation affordance para-\ndigm. This is a stimulus–response compatibility paradigm which\nhas been used in numerous studies (Tucker and Ellis, 1998;\nSymes et al., 2007; Vainio et al., 2007; Riggio et al., 2008) showing\nReceived Oct. 10, 2008; revised March 13, 2009; accepted March 15, 2009.\nWe thank David Gilbert, Sandra Anti, Oliver Do¨hrmann, Christian Altmann, and Iver Iversen for their support and\nassistance.\n*Y.Y. and M.J.N. contributed equally to this work.\nThe authors declare no competing financial interests.\nThis article is freely available online through theJ NeurosciOpen Choice option.\nCorrespondence should be addressed to Yavor Yalachkov, Institute of Medical Psychology, Goethe-University,\nHeinrich-Hoffmann-Strasse 10, D-60528 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

Thus, it is a suit-\nable instrument to study the automatic activation of motor rep-\nresentations by graspable tools (Tucker and Ellis, 1998; Vainio et\nal., 2007). Since the automatization of drug-use behaviors in-\ncreases with repeated practice, action representations on both the\nneural and behavioral levels should correlate with the individual\ndegree of nicotine dependence.\nMaterials and Methods\nfMRI study\nSubjects. All participants were right handed, had normal or corrected-to-\nnormal vision and were students or university academic staff. The smok-\ners (n /H1100515, mean age 27.1 years (SD/H110053.8), 6 men and 9 women) were\ninstructed to smoke according to their usual habits. Their individual level\nof nicotine dependence was evaluated with the Fagerstro¨m Test for Nic-\notine Dependence (FTND) (Bleich et al., 2002). The mean FTND score\naccounted to 3.13, SD/H110052.39. We recruited light as well as heavy smokers\nto represent the whole spectrum of smoking behavior. The nonsmokers\n[n /H1100515, mean age 28.7 years (SD/H110056.8), 6 men and 9 women] claimed\nthat they had never smoked. After complete description of the study to\nthe subjects, written informed consent was obtained.\nExperimental design. During the experiment a total of 40 grayscale\nimages from different categories were presented to the participants. The\nfirst category comprised images of humans smoking cigarettes (“smoke”\ncondition) and the second category consisted of images of humans hold-\ning pens or glasses in their hands and mouths (“control” condition). The\nother three categories (data not reported here) consisted of images of\neveryday tools and animals and scrambled images. The images of hu-\nmans were taken from the International Smoking Image Series (Gilbert\nand Rabinovich, 2006). We ensured that all images had the same size.\nThe participants underwent four functional runs and one anatomical\nscan. A dummy block at the beginning of each run ensured that T1\nsaturation effects were avoided. The eight images from the five categories\nwere presented in separate blocks. Blocks for each image category were\nrepeated three times within each run in pseudorandomized order, thus\nresulting in 15 experimental/H110011 dummy block per run. Blocks lasted for\n16 s and alternated with fixation intervals of equal length. Images were\npresented in a randomized order for 1500 ms each with 500 ms inter-\nstimulus intervals in a block. We chose a passive paradigm to avoid\nconfounding task-related sensorimotor activations. The participants\nwere instructed to fixate the white cross and attend the images, which\nwere projected onto a vertical screen positioned inside the scanner. Sub-\njects viewed the screen through a mirror.\nThe fMRI procedure was performed on a 3-tesla Magnetom Allegra\nscanner (Siemens) at the Brain Imaging Center in Frankfurt am Main. A\ngradient-recalled echo-planar imaging sequence with the following pa-\nrameters was used: 34 slices; repetition time (TR) 2000 ms; echo time\n(TE) 30 ms; field of view 192 mm; in-plane resolution 3.3 mm\n2; slice\nthickness 3 mm; gap thickness 0.3 mm; 264 volumes per functional run.\nFor the anatomical imaging a magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition\ngradient echo sequence (TR 2300 ms, TE 3.49 ms, flip angle 12°, matrix\n256 /H11003256, and voxel size 1.0/H110031.0 /H110031.0 mm\n3) was used.\nStatistical analysis. Data were analyzed using the BrainVoyager QX\n1.10.4 software package (Brain Innovation). Preprocessing included the\nfollowing steps: three-dimensional motion correction, linear-trend re-\nmoval and temporal high-pass filtering at 0.0054 Hz, and slice-scan-time\ncorrection with sinc interpolation. Functional and Talairach-\nstandardized anatomical data were used to build a voxel time course file\nand were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian filter of 8 mm full width at\nhalf maximum. Volume-based statistical analyses were performed at the\nwhole-brain level. For each voxel, the time course was regressed on a set\nof dummy-coded predictors representing the experimental conditions.\nTo account for the shape and delay of the hemodynamic response, the\npredictor time courses (boxcar functions) were convolved with a gamma\nfunction.\nFirst, a two-way random-effects analysis (RFX) ANOVA with factor 1\n“stimulus category” (smoke vs control) and factor 2 “group” (smokers vs\nnonsmokers) was calculated (n /H1100530 [15 smokers, 15 nonsmokers]).\nThen, a whole-brain statistical map for the interaction “stimulus cate-\ngory” /H11003“group” was computed. Thus, we were able to show which re-\ngions exhibited differential fMRI activations across groups and object\ncategories. Further analysis of these regions was performed with a ROI-\nbased random-effects general linear model to identify the group/object\ndifferences which had caused the significant RFX ANOVA interaction.\nUnpaired t tests of the estimated\n/H9252values for the two groups in the smoke\nand control conditions were performed to reveal the regions in which the\nfMRI activation during presentations of smoking-related objects was\nhigher in smokers than nonsmokers.\nFor the analysis of correlations between fMRI cue reactivity and the\nindividual degree of nicotine dependence a whole-brain RFX ANCOVA\nwith the contrast “smoke/H11022control” and the covariate “FTND scores”\nwas computed (n /H1100515 smokers, “RFX ANCOVA-FTND”). The resulting\nstatistical map showed the regions where the\n/H9252weights of the GLM-\ncontrast “smoke/H11022control” and the individual FTND scores correlated\nsignificantly.\nA similar procedure was used for correlations between fMRI cue reac-\ntivity and the behavioral task performance (see below). A whole-brain\nRFX ANCOVA with the contrast “smoke/H11022control” and the covariate\n“affordance index for smoking objects” was computed (n /H110058 smokers;\n“RFX ANCOVA-affordance”). The resulting statistical map showed the\nregions where the\n/H9252weights of the GLM-contrast “smoke/H11022control” and\nthe individual affordance indices for smoking objects correlated\nsignificantly.\nThe RFX ANCOVA-FTND was computed with the data of 15 partic-\nipants who passively viewed smoking-associated and control images. The\nRFX ANCOVA-affordance was based on the data of 8 smokers who were\ninvolved additionally in the active stimulus–response compatibility task.\nAccording to our hypotheses, automatized smoking-related skills and\naction knowledge should be activated in both cases and may share com-\nmon neural correlates. However, due to the different experimental de-\nsigns, we did not expect that the two statistical maps resulting from the\nRFX ANCOVA-FTND and RFX ANCOVA-affordance would reveal\nidentical regions. We performed a further ROI-based analysis of the two\nstatistical whole-brain maps to assess the similarity of the neural corre-\nlates of automatized smoking-related schemata in the two tasks. In the\nregions revealed by the whole-brain RFX ANCOVA-FTND, a ROI-based\nRFX ANCOVA with the contrast “smoke/H11022control” and the covariate\n“affordance index for smoking objects” was performed. Similarly, a ROI-\nbased RFX ANCOVA with the contrast “smoke/H11022control” and the co-\nvariate “FTND” was computed in the regions revealed by the whole-\nbrain RFX ANCOVA-affordance. All statistical maps were corrected for\nmultiple comparisons using a cluster-size threshold procedure and pro-\njected onto anatomical data sets averaged across all 30 participants.\nBehavioral study\nSubjects. We recruited 8 of the smokers [mean age 27.5 years (SD/H110056.09),\n3 men and 5 women; mean FTND score 2.38 (SD/H110052.67)], who had\nparticipated in the fMRI experiment and whose FTND scores had re-\nmained stable over the time interval between the fMRI and behavioral\nexperiments (on average 5 months), and 8 nonsmokers [mean age 28.13\nyears (SD/H110053.27), 3 men and 5 women]. All the participants were right-\nhanded students or university academic staff and had normal or\ncorrected-to-normal vision. The smokers were instructed to smoke ac-\ncording to their usual habit. After complete description of the study to\nthe subjects, written informed consent was obtained.\nExperimental design. The participants sat in a dark, soundproofed\nroom in front of a monitor on which visual stimuli were displayed. The\nexperiment comprised five runs with 112 trials each. Each trial began\nwith a white fixation cross visible for 1500 ms. Afterwards, a randomly\nchosen object was presented for 700 ms. Then the white fixation cross\nappeared again over the object and after 150 ms changed its color ran-\ndomly from white to blue or brown. The new color was kept for 180 ms\nand then the fixation cross turned its color back to white. Half of the\nparticipants was instructed to respond with the left control button on the\nkeyboard to a color change from white to blue and with the right control\nYalachkov et al.• Cortical Action Networks and Nicotine Dependence J. Neurosci., April 15, 2009 • 29(15):4922– 4929 • 4923\nbutton to a color change from white to brown. The other half of the\nparticipants received the inversed mapping instruction.\nGrayscale images of objects from two categories were used: (1) every-\nday tools/manipulable objects (e.g., cup, scissors, hammer, etc.) and (2)\nsmoking-related objects (e.g., cigarette, lighter, etc.). Images originated\nfrom commercially available image collections (150.000 PhotoObjects\nGraphics Collection and The Big Box of Art 615 000, Hemera Technol-\nogies). We ensured that all images had the same size. Each of the objects\nwas presented with its handle or side where the object is usually grasped\nin left or right orientation. Thus, we had a 2/H110032 /H110032 /H110032 experimental\ndesign (within-subjects factors: object category, responding hand, object\norientation; between-subjects factor: smokers vs nonsmokers). Seventy\ntrials were presented for each of the 8 within-subjects conditions.\nStatistical analysis.Reaction times and error rates were recorded for\neach participant and mean reaction time was calculated for each experi-\nmental condition. Following a well established statistical analysis proce-\ndure (Tucker and Ellis, 1998; Vainio et al., 2007), trials with reaction\ntimes deviating by/H110222 SDs from the participant’s mean were excluded\nfrom the analysis [mean eliminated trials 23.6 (4.2% of all 560 trials per\nsubject)].\nThe orientation affordance effect has been defined as a shorter reaction\ntime when the side of the response hand and the orientation of the\npresented prime object are identical (e.g., a response with the left hand to\nan object oriented to the left) compared with when they differ (e.g., a\nresponse with the left hand to an object oriented to the right) (Tucker and\nEllis, 1998; Vainio et al., 2007). To facilitate the search for more specific\ninteractions (e.g., group/H11003object category interaction for the affordance\neffect), we computed an “affordance index” (AI) separately for each ob-\nject category across both hands according to the following formula:\nAI/H11005/H20875\n(LHRO /H11002LHLO)\n(LHRO /H11001LHLO\n/H11001\n(RHLO /H11002RHRO)\n(RHLO /H11001RHRO)/H20876/2 ,\nwhere LHRO is the mean reaction time for the left hand and right-\noriented objects; LHLO is the mean reaction time for the left hand and\nleft-oriented objects; RHLO is the mean reaction time for the right hand\nand left-oriented objects; and RHRO is the mean reaction time for the\nright hand and right-oriented objects. Thus, a higher affordance index\nfor an object category indicates shorter reaction times for congruent\ncombination between responding hand and orientation of the respective\nobject (i.e., left hand and left object orientation, right hand and right\nobject orientation) compared with an incongruent combination of the\nsame (i.e., left hand and right object orientation, right hand and left\nobject orientation). A spatially compatible combination is considered to\nactivate the associated motor representation (Tucker and Ellis, 1998;\nVainio et al., 2007; Symes et al., 2007; Riggio et al., 2008; see discussion\nfor more information on the nature of the affordance effect). Therefore a\nhigher affordance index would be an indicator for an activated motor\nrepresentation and thus a facilitated response. We performed two\nrepeated-measures ANOVAs: in the first one we searched for a general\naffordance effect and used the reaction times as dependent variable,\nhand, object orientation, and object category as within-subject factors,\nand group membership as between-subjects factor. In the second\nANOVA we looked for differential affordance effects depending on the\nstimulus category and the group membership, i.e., we used the affor-\ndance index as dependent variable, object category as within-subject fac-\ntor and group membership as between-subjects factor. The individual\naffordance indices of the smokers for everyday and smoking-related ob-\njects were correlated (Pearson correlation) with the corresponding\nFTND scores.\nResults\nfMRI study\nThe two-way whole-brain RFX ANOVA with the factors “stimu-\nlus category” (smoke vs control) and “group” (smokers vs non-\nsmokers) revealed a significant stimulus category/H11003group inter-\naction in the regions listed in Table 1 (F /H113506.1; p /H110210.001,\ncorrected for multiple comparisons). The ROI-basedt tests indi-\ncated higher fMRI activation for smokers compared with non-\nsmokers during the presentation of smoking cues in mainly two\nsets of brain regions which were identified by the whole-brain\nRFX ANOVA interaction. The first set consisted of left ventral\nand dorsal striatum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in-\nsula (Fig. 1B), uncus and medial frontal gyrus, right posterior\nsubcallosal gyrus, and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PhG).

The\nfirst one consisted of regions known to mediate the motivational\naspects of addiction, while the second one consisted of brain\nregions related to tool use knowledge and action representation.\nActivations of some of the latter regions were correlated with the\nlevel of nicotine dependence.\nThe first network comprised the left ventral and dorsal stria-\ntum, DLPFC, insula, uncus, and medial frontal gyrus as well as\nright posterior subcallosal gyrus and bilateral PhG. These regions\nhave been associated with subjective re-\nsponses of craving and the reward system\n(Breiter et al., 1997; Brody et al., 2002;\nGru¨sser et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 2004;\nChiamulera, 2005; Naqvi et al., 2007;\nFregni et al., 2008). The ventral striatum\nhas been proposed to mediate the rein-\nforcing effects of drugs (Drevets et al.,\n2001; Kelley and Berridge, 2002; Volkow et\nal., 2004). The dorsal striatum is known\nfor its role in stimulus–response learning\nand habitual behaviors (Packard and\nKnowlton, 2002) and may be of great im-\nportance for compulsive drug-taking be-\nhavior (Gerdeman et al., 2003; Hyman et\nal., 2006). Moreover, dorsal striatal dopa-\nminergic activity has been shown to be as-\nsociated with cue-induced cocaine craving\nand could thus reflect the automatized na-\nture of craving in later stages of addiction\n(Volkow et al., 2006). Ventral domains of\nthe striatum may be more important for\nthe early stages of addiction, whereas the\nmore dorsal domains may take over con-\ntrol in the later stages, when drug usage is\neasily triggered by conditioned stimuli and\nis executed automatically (Everitt and\nRobbins, 2005). The higher activations in\nsmokers compared with nonsmokers\nwhen exposed to smoking cues may thus\nreflect reward-related processes or experi-\nence of craving. Activations in the dorsal\nstriatum may form the neural basis for the\nhabitual link between conditioned cues\nand smoking behavior. The fact that\nsmokers exhibited higher BOLD signals in\nboth the ventral and dorsal parts of the\nstriatum can be attributed to the fact that\nthe smokers’ group consisted both of light\nand heavy smokers. Interestingly, we\nfound no correlations between the degree\nof nicotine dependence and activations in\nthis craving-related network.\nThe second network comprising bilat-\neral PMC, left SPL, and right lateral cere-\nbellum might underlie the representation\nof drug-taking skills as well as the preparation and efficient exe-\ncution of the specific action sequences. These regions are thought\nto form part of a system representing tool use skills and action\nknowledge (Grafton et al., 1997; Chao and Martin, 2000; Gre`zes\net al., 2003; Johnson-Frey, 2004) and to be crucial for the efficient\nexecution of the corresponding actions (Creem-Regehr and Lee,\n2005; Lewis, 2006). The premotor cortex is important for linking\nintent or knowledge of how to execute an action to the following\nsequence of motor commands as well as for selecting actions on the\nbasis of arbitrary cues (Fink et al., 1999; Arbib et al., 2000; Gre`zes et\nal., 2003). The lateral cerebellum is known to encode skilled action\nrepresentations, internal models of tools, and automatized actions\n(Imamizu et al., 2003; Higuchi et al., 2007). The left superior parietal\nlobule has a prominent role in planning and executing tool use\nmovements (Johnson-Frey et al., 2005). Apparently, smoking cues\nautomatically activate smokers’ neural representations of the corre-\nsponding tool use skills and action knowledge.\nFigure 2. Association between neural cue reactivity in smokers and the individual degree of nicotine dependence. The figure\nillustrates some of the regions where the covariate “FTND score” correlated significantly with the/H9252values of the whole-brain RFX\nANCOVA contrast “smoke/H11022control” (n /H1100515 smokers).

Neurosci., April 15, 2009• 29(15):4922– 4929 Yalachkov et al. • Cortical Action Networks and Nicotine Dependence\nThe association between the individual level of nicotine de-\npendence and the/H9252values from the whole-brain RFX ANCOVA\nin left SPL, left pMTG/ITC/FG, and right PMC and MFG further\nsupports the assumed relationship between the neural represen-\ntations of drug-related action schemata which are dependent on\nthe smoker’s learning history (Tiffany, 1990), and the severity of\nnicotine dependence. The FG/ITC is related both to the analysis\nof object features and to the interpretation of visual action\n(Haxby et al., 2001; Chaminade et al., 2005). The pMTG is in-\nvolved in processing action knowledge (Johnson-Frey et al.,\n2005). Several studies have pointed out the importance of MFG\nfor skilled movement and tool-associated action identification\n(Grabowski et al., 1998; Haaland et al., 2000). Increased smoking\nexpertise may thus include an enhanced ability to activate the\nrespective smoking skill and action representations. Behavioral\nevidence also suggests that habitual, automatized actions are a\nfrequent reason for smoking in more dependent smokers (Pias-\necki et al., 2007).\nThe absence of a correlation between FTND score and fMRI\nactivation in craving-related brain regions may be attributable to\nthe fact that our participants were not nicotine-deprived. Indeed,\nthere is evidence that nicotine deprivation and cigarette availabil-\nity affect cue reactivity (Droungas et al., 1995; Carter and Tiffany,\n2001; McBride et al., 2006). However, our aim was to investigate\nreactivity as closely as possible to natural everyday smoking situ-\nations. Furthermore, it has been shown that craving occurs also in\nnatural environments without an experimentally induced nico-\ntine deprivation (Piasecki et al., 2007).\nOur second experiment investigated the orientation affor-\ndance effect as a function of group and object category. Orienta-\ntion affordance refers to faster responses for spatial compatibility\nbetween the responding hand and the orientation of the priming\nimage of a graspable object. It has been proposed that this facili-\ntation of reactions is attributable to the automatic activation of\ncorresponding motor representations by the priming object\n(Tucker and Ellis, 1998; Symes et al., 2007; Vainio et al., 2007;\nRiggio et al., 2008). Thus, the affordance effect represents a suit-\nable measure of automatized smoking-related action representa-\ntions. Our data provide evidence for a general affordance effect,\nindicating faster reactions for congruency between the respond-\ning hand and the orientation of the priming object. Smokers and\nnonsmokers exhibited comparable affordance effects for com-\nmon nonsmoking objects. Smoking paraphernalia led to affor-\ndance effects in smokers only, i.e., reactions to smoking-related\nobjects were facilitated by compatible object orientation in smok-\ners but not in nonsmokers. Thus, smokers’ responses to smoking\nparaphernalia can be triggered as automatically and easily as to\ncomparable everyday objects. Furthermore, experience-based\nmotor representations of smoking actions have been established\nin smokers only.\nAlthough there was a general affordance effect and a “group/H11003\nobject category” interaction for the affordance index, there were\nno general reaction time differences between the groups and no\n“group/H11003object category” interaction for the reaction times. This\nwas not unexpected since only the affordance index takes the\ncompatibility between responding hand and object orientation\ninto account and measures the action facilitation effect.\nThe FTND scores correlated with the affordance effect of\nsmokers for smoking but not for everyday objects. Furthermore,\nthe whole-brain RFX ANCOVA revealed remarkable correlations\nbetween the covariate “affordance index for smoking objects”\nand fMRI cue reactivity in left PMC, SPL, MFG, and right ITC.\nThis shows that automatized behavioral responsiveness to\nsmoking-associated cues is more pronounced in heavier smokers\nand is related to the neural underpinnings of drug-taking skills.\nThus, the smokers’ experience with smoking-related objects was\nreflected in both behavioral affordance profiles and the activation\nof tool use-related brain regions.\nThe fMRI cue reactivity in the majority of those regions which\nwere identified by the whole-brain RFX ANCOVAs using the one\ncovariate also showed a significant ROI-based correlation with\nthe other covariate. This further supports the association of fMRI\nactivation of action-related brain regions with the severity of nic-\notine dependence and automatized behavioral responsiveness to\nsmoking-related objects.\nThe strong activation of smoking-related action schemata in\nsmokers might either be interpreted as a cause of smoking or as an\neffect of exaggerated consumption. Research on experience-\nbased neural plasticity shows that intensive engagement in an\nactivity leads to stronger neural representations of the respective\nactivity and the used objects (Pearce et al., 2000; Sanes and Do-\nnoghue, 2000; Calvo-Merino et al., 2006; Schwenkreis et al., 2007;\nTable 3.

Neurosci., April 15, 2009 • 29(15):4922– 4929 • 4927\nWeisberg et al., 2007). Therefore, we suggest that strong activa-\ntion of the smoking-related action schemata is the consequence\nof the frequently executed process of smoking. On the other\nhand, triggered schemata may also reduce the threshold for exe-\ncuting the action of smoking, thus contributing to the high smok-\ning relapse rates.\nTogether, our findings confirm that nicotine dependence in-\nvolves striatum, insula, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which\nhave been intensively studied in relation to craving and drug-\nseeking habits. The present results provide new evidence that\nsmoking-associated images can activate neural representations in\nbrain regions probably encoding the respective drug-taking skills\nand action knowledge. Responses of action-related regions to\nsmoking cues may thus represent a novel neural correlate of nic-\notine dependence. On the behavioral level, smoking parapherna-\nlia activate motor representations in smokers but not in non-\nsmokers as easily and automatically as similarly familiar objects.\nThis effect is linked to the fMRI cue reactivity of smokers in tool\nuse and action-related brain regions. Both neural and behavioral\ncorrelates of the drug-taking skills and action knowledge corre-\nlate with the level of nicotine dependence. The activation of such\ndeeply embedded action schemata might contribute to the high\nrelapse risk in nicotine addiction. We hope that these findings\nwill initiate the development of novel neural and behavioral\nmarkers of therapy success or risk of relapse, and guide new ther-\napeutic strategies addressing the importance of involuntary, au-\ntomatic action sequences.\nReferences\nArbib MA, Billard A, Iacoboni M, Oztop E (2000) Synthetic brain imaging:\ngrasping, mirror neurons and imitation.
