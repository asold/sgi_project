The article describes research results of thermal properties of mineral oil and natural ester. \nPercentage proportions of both the liquids were as follows: 100/0, 95/5, 80/20, 50/50, 20/80, 0/100. The \nauthors present measurement results of thermal c onductivity, viscosity, specific heat, density, and thermal \nexpansion of the created mixtures. The measurements were taken in a relati vely wide temperature range: \n25 ºC, 40 ºC, 60 ºC, and 80 ºC. On the basis of the measurement results, convection heat tra nsfer coefficient \nα was calculated and the most advantageous proportion of both the components of the mixture was pointed \nin terms of cooling effectiveness of the transformer. \n1 Introduction\nInsulating liquids are an integral part of the insulating \nsystem of most power t ransformers in the world. Due to \ntheir good properties, they have a role of an electric \ninsulation and cooling medium [1 -3]. Keeping in mind \nthat heat transport in the transformer proceeds the \nfollowing way: heat source → paper impregnated with \nliquid → in sulating liquid → tank → air; it is liquid \nproperties that will substantially decide about the \nefficiency of heat transfer [2, 4-6].\nThe properties which determine the ability of a liquid \nto heat transfer are: thermal conductivity λ, kinematic \nviscosity υ, specific heat cp, density ρ, and thermal \nexpansion β. These properties determine the ability of a \nliquid to cool the device, i.e. coefficient α [7-9]. The \ngreater this ability is, the higher the value of coefficient \nα. In turn, coefficient α is greater wh en thermal \nconductivity, specific heat, density, and liquid thermal \nexpansion are higher and its viscosity is lower [1, 2, 5].\nThe most frequently used insulating liquid in power \nengineering devices is mineral oil [1, 10, 11 ]. The \npopularity of applying mi neral oil results from its low \nprice and properties which have been well known for \ndecades. Lately, stricter and stricter requirements \nconcerning reliability of power engineering devices and \na prospect of a real deficit of petroleum have contributed \nto search for insulating liquids alternative to mineral oil \n[12-16].\nIn the early 1990s, research on transformer liquids of \nplant origin was initiated. After less than ten years later, \ncommercial application of natural esters was started in \ndistribution transfor mers. Now we are observing their \nwider and wider application, including power \ntransformers [ 11]. The advantages of applying natural \nesters instead of mineral oil are very good fire properties \n(high flash and fire point, and low net calorific value) \nand env ironmental ones, which include first of all full \nbiodegradability and low toxicity [17 -19]. Undoubtedly, \nanother advantage resulting from applying natural esters \nis also retarding the process of paper insulation ageing of \nthe transformer [12, 20, 21]. Unfo rtunately, these esters, \nin comparison to mineral oil, are also characteristic of \nmuch higher viscosity and higher solidification \ntemperature [2, 11].\nRecently research on properties of insulating liquid \nmixtures has been conducted in many scientific cente rs \nin the world. These mixtures can be obtained in two \nways. The first one is the so -called retrofilling, which \nconsists in intentional replacing one insulating liquid \n(most often mineral oil) by another (natural or synthetic \nesters). This allows, among ot hers, prolonging the \nremaining operation time of the power device [22]. This \nprocess, however, does not guarantee full removing the \nliquid which filled the transformer before. A small \namount of it (not exceeding 8%) can be deposited in, for \nexample, satura ted paper insulation, windings, the core, \nand other hardly accessible places [23]. Thus as a result \nof filling the modernized unit with a new insulating \nliquid, we unintentionally obtain a mixture with the \nliquid which previously filled the transformer. Th e other \nway consists in applying an intended mixture in the new \ntransformer, which consists of two or more insulating \nliquids of a known proportion. This results in obtaining a \nmixture, which is characteristic of improvement of some,\nselected properties in reference to the base liquids [10, \n13-15, 24, 25].\nIndependently of the method how the mixture is \ncreated, the purpose of the application is to improve \nproperties of the insulating liquid, which consequently \naffects the operation period of the transformer . Research \non mixtures of insulating liquids which is conducted in \nmany scientific centres all over the world refer mainly to \nelectric properties. The remaining properties, including \nE3S Web of Conferences 19, 01040 (2017) DOI: 10.1051/e3sconf/20171901040\nEEMS 2017\n© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Thus we should take into \nconsideration that applying mixtures of insulating liquids \nwhich are characteristic of better electric properties and \nworse thermal properties in reference to the base liquids, \nwill result in accelerating ageing processes t aking place \nin the insulating system of the transformer and reducing \nthe time of its operation. Therefore, this article presents \nresearch results concerning properties that influence the \nefficiency of transformer cooling properties.\n2 Purpose and range of the research\nThe purpose of the undertaken research was to determine \nthe influence of proportions of mineral oil with natural \nester on thermal properties of a created mixture. The \nresearch range covered the measurement of thermal \nconductivity λ, kinematic viscosity υ, specific heat c\np,\ndensity ρ, and thermal expansion β. On the basis of the \nmeasured properties and the equation presented below, \ncoefficient α was determined [8, 9]:\n(1)1 131   n nqnn\npcn nn ngnc   \nwhere: α – convection heat transfer coefficient of the\nliquid [Wˑm -2ˑK-1], c, n – constants dependent on the \ncharacter of the flow, λ – thermal conductivity \n[Wˑm-1ˑK-1], g – acceleration of gravity [mˑs -2], \nδ – characteristic dimension connected with liquid flow \n[m], β – thermal expansion [K -1], ρ – density [gˑl-1], \ncp - specific heat [Jˑkg -1ˑK-1], υ – kinematic viscosity \n[mm2ˑs-1], q – surface thermal load [W·m -2]. The \ncharacteristic dimension δ was equal to 1 m. By contrast, \nthe values of constants c and n were assumed according \nto the figures listed in Table 1.\nTable 1. Values of constants c and n dependent \non the flow type [8,9]. \nFlow type Gr·Pr c n \nNo flow < 10-3 0.45 0 \nLaminar flow 10-3 – 5·102 1.18 0.125 \nTransitional \nflow 5·102 – 2·107 0.54 0.25 \nTurbulent flow >2·107 0.135 0.333 \nFor measurements of thermal properties, the authors \nused mineral oil named Nytro Taurus manufactured by \nNynas and natural ester named Envirotemp FR3 made by \nCargil. Both liquids in investigations were new and \nunused. Water content was 2 ppm in case of mineral oil, \nand 34 ppm in case of natural ester. Acid number was \nless than 0,010 mg\nKOH·g-1liquid for mineral oil, and 0,020 \nmgKOH·g-1liquid for natural ester. Measurements of thermal \nconductivity of the mixtures were done using authorial \nmeasurement system, described in [26] . Measurements \nof kinematic viscosity, density, and thermal expansion of \nthe mixtures were done using authorial measurements \nsystems according to obligatory standards [27 -29]. \nMeasurement of specific heat of the mixtures were done \nusing the differential sc anning calorimeter Mettler \nToledo DSC1. In order to do the investigations, the \nauthors prepared mixtures of mineral oil and natural \nester of the following percentage concentrations of both \nthe liquids: 100/0, 95/5, 80/20, 50/50, 20/80, 5/95, and \n0/100. The measurements were taken at the temperature \nof 25 ºC, 40 ºC, 60 ºC, and 80ºC. The results of the \ninvestigations are presented in the following section.\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 Thermal conductivity of the mixture of \nmineral oil and natural ester  \nTable 2 and Fig. 1 contain measurement results of \nthermal conductivity λ of a mixture of mineral oil (MO) \nand natural ester (NE) depending on ester concentration. \nAs we can observe, with increase of natural ester \ncontent, thermal conductivity λ considerably increases.\nTable 2. Measurement results of thermal conductivity λ of the \nmixture of mineral oil (MO) and natural ester (NE). \nProportion of mineral oil \n(MO) and  \nnatural ester (NE) \nTemperature T \n25 ºC 40 ºC 60 ºC 80 ºC \nThermal conductivity λ \n[W·m-1·K-1] \n100% MO 0% NE 0.133 0.130 0.128 0.126 \n95% MO 5% NE 0.136 0.134 0.132 0.130 \n80% MO 20% NE 0.144 0.141 0.139 0.137 \n50% MO 50% NE 0.158 0.156 0.153 0.152 \n20% MO 80% NE 0.173 0.171 0.168 0.166 \n5% MO 95% NE 0.179 0.177 0.174 0.172 \n0% MO 100% NE 0.182 0.180 0.178 0.175 \nFig. 1. Thermal conductivity λ of the mixture of mineral oil \nand natural ester.\nE3S Web of Conferences 19, 01040 (2017) DOI: 10.1051/e3sconf/20171901040\nEEMS 2017\n2\nThis increase is practically linear. The increase of λ\nwas equal to 36.8% (for 25 ºC), 38.5% (for 40 ºC), \n39.1% (for 60 ºC), and 38.9% (for 80 ºC). As we can see, \nthis increase was at a constant level and it practically did \nnot depend on temperature. Summing up, we can say \nthat natural ester increase s thermal conductivity of the \nmixture of mineral oil and natural ester, and \nconsequently they can improve cooling properties of \nsuch a mixture.\n3.2 Viscosity of the mixture of mineral oil and \nnatural ester  \nTable 3 and Fig. 2 present research results of kinematic \nviscosity υ of the mixture of mineral oil and natural \nester, depending on the ester concentration. \nTable 3. Measurement results of kinematic viscosity υ of the \nmixture of mineral oil (MO) and natural ester (NE). \nProportion of mineral oil \n(MO) and  \nnatural ester (NE) \nTemperature T \n25 ºC 40 ºC 60 ºC 80 ºC \nKinematic viscosity υ \n[mm2·s-1] \n100% MO 0% NE 17.08 9.59 5.37 3.43 \n95% MO 5% NE 17.67 9.93 5.44 3.59 \n80% MO 20% NE 21.34 12.25 6.89 4.46 \n50% MO 50% NE 31.68 18.48 10.28 6.50 \n20% MO 80% NE 45.81 26.23 14.67 9.25 \n5% MO 95% NE 53.42 30.78 17.24 10.88 \n0% MO 100% NE 56.29 32.66 18.29 11.50 \nFig. 2. Kinematic viscosity υof the mixture of mineral oil and \nnatural ester.\nAs it was shown, increase of natural ester content \nincreases viscosity of the mixture very significantly. \nInitially, this increase is tiny (up to 5% of ester content) \nand next it is very clear (over 5% of ester content). \nIncrease of viscosity υ was equal to 230% (for 25 ºC), \n241% (for 40 ºC), 241% (for 60 ºC), and 235% (for \n80 ºC). This increase, caused by increase of natural ester \ncontent in the mixture, was practically independent of \ntemperature. Summing up, we can state that natural ester \nclearly increase s viscosity of the mixture. This fact can \nresult in substantial deterioration of the rmal properties of \nthe mixture.\n3.3 Specific heat of the mixture of mineral oil \nand natural ester  \nTable 4 and Fig. 3 present measurement results of \nspecific heat cp of the mixture of mineral oil and natural \nester depending on ester concentration. Increase of the \nnatural ester content caused a certain increase of the \nspecific heat of the mixture. This increase was linear. \nThe increase of cp was equal to 6.6% (for 25 ºC), 5.4% \n(for 40 ºC), 4.3% (for 60 ºC), and 5.7% (for 80 ºC). As \nwe can see, the increase o f specific heat caused by the \nincrease of the natural ester content in the mixture \npractically did not depend on temperature. Summing up, \nwe can say that natural ester can slightly improve \ncooling properties of the mixture of mineral oil and \nnatural ester.\nTable 4. Measurement results of specific heat cp of the mixture \nof mineral oil (MO) and natural ester (NE). \nProportion of mineral \noil (MO) and  \nnatural ester (NE) \nTemperature T \n25 ºC 40 ºC 60 ºC 80 ºC \nSpecific heat cp [J·kg-1·K-1] \n100% MO 0% NE 1902 1974 2077 2187 \n95% MO 5% NE 1904 1975 2078 2192 \n80% MO 20% NE 1925 1995 2094 2212 \n50% MO 50% NE 1961 2025 2119 2226 \n20% MO 80% NE 1980 2036 2123 2233 \n5% MO 95% NE 2024 2080 2160 2257 \n0% MO 100% NE 2028 2082 2166 2259 \nFig. 3.

As it wa s shown, the \nincrease of natural ester content caused the linear \nincrease of mixture density. Increase of density ρ was \nequal to 5.8% (for 25 ºC), 6.0% (for 40 ºC), 5.6% (for 60 \nºC), and 5.8% (for 80 ºC). This increase by a few \npercent, caused by the increase of natural ester content in \nthe mixture, was practically independent of temperature. \nSumming up, we can say that increase of natural ester \ncontent can cause a slight improvement of cooling \nabilities of the mixture of mineral oil and natural ester. \nTable 5. Measurement results of density ρ of the mixture of \nmineral oil (MO) and natural ester (NE). \nProportion of mineral oil \n(MO) and  \nnatural ester (NE) \n  \nTemperature T \n25 ºC 40 ºC 60 ºC 80 ºC \nDensity ρ [g·l-1] \n100% MO 0% NE 867 857 845 832 \n95% MO 5% NE 870 860 847 834 \n80% MO 20% NE 877 867 854 842 \n50% MO 50% NE 890 880 869 856 \n20% MO 80% NE 906 896 883 871 \n5% MO 95% NE 915 904 891 878 \n0% MO 100% NE 917 908 892 880 \n \nFig. 4. Density ρ of the mixture of mineral oil and natural ester. \n3.5 Thermal expansion of the mixture of mineral \noil and natural ester  \nTable 6 and Fig.  5 show measurement results of thermal \nexpansion β of a mixture of mineral oil and natural ester \ndepending on ester concentration. As we can see, \nincrease of natural ester content practically did not cause \nany changes of thermal expansion of the mixture. The \nlack of expansion changes was noted for all the \ntemperature values. Thus we can say that increase of \nnatural ester content does not result in any changes of \ncooling abilities of an analyzed mixture. \nTable 6.

Thermal expansion β of the mixture of mineral oil and \nnatural ester. \n3.6 Convection heat transfer coefficient  of the \nmixture of mineral oil and natural ester  \nTable 7 and Fig.  6 present calculation results of the \nconvection heat transfer coefficient α of a mixture of \nmineral oil and natural ester depending on ester \nconcentration. The calculations of coefficient α were \ndone on the basis of the measurement results presented \nin the previous subsections (3.1-3.5). \nAs it results from the table and the figure, with \nincrease of nat ural ester content in the mixture, its \ncoefficient α was initially rising a little (up to 5% of ester \ncontent) and next it was clearly decreasing (starting from \n5% of ester content). This trend could be observed \nindependently of temperature. The initial in crease of \ncoefficient α (up to 5% of ester content) was very small \nand it was merely 0.4% (for 25 ºC), 0.8% (for 40 ºC), \n1.3% (for 60 ºC), 0.9% (for 80 ºC). In turn, the drop of \ncoefficient α (starting from 5% of ester content) was \nE3S Web of Conferences 19, 01040 (2017) DOI: 10.1051/e3sconf/20171901040\nEEMS 2017\n4\n \nmore significant and it was 4.5% (for 25 ºC), 4.8% (for \n40 ºC), 5.4% (for 60 ºC), and 8.1% (for 80 ºC). \nTable 7.

Convection heat transfer coefficient α of the mixture of \nmineral oil and natural ester. \nThe initial increase of coefficient α caused by \nincrease of ester content in the mixture (up to 5%) \nresulted from many effects. These include the increase of \nthermal conductivity, specific heat, and density, despite a \nslight increase of viscosity. In turn, the drop of \ncoefficient α (over 5% of ester content) was caused by a \nviolent viscosity increase, despite resulting increase of \nthermal conductivity, specific heat, and density. We can \nsay on this basis that the best combination of the mixture \ncomponents is 95% of mineral oi l and 5% of natural \nester. \n4 Conclusions \nThe increase of natural ester content in the mixture of \nmineral oil and natural ester resulted in increase of \nthermal conductivity by almost 40%, viscosity increase \nby over 200%, specific heat increase by about 5%, \ndensity increase by about 5%, and no changes of thermal \nexpansion. In contrast, coefficient α has its maximum for \na mixture of 95% of mineral oil and 5% of natural ester.\n \nCoefficient α was 141.65 W·m -2·K-1 in case of pure \nmineral oil and 142.86 W·m -2·K-1 in case of mixture \nwith maximal convection heat transfer coefficient, for  \n80 ºC (Table 7). T emperature decrease Δ T (between \nwindings and tank) for pure oil is 24.7 ºC, and for \nmixture with maximal α is 24.5 ºC (surface heat density \nequals 3500 W·m\n-2). It means that difference of Δ T \nbetween pure oil and mixture whit maximal α is just  \n0.2 ºC. \nFrom the practical point of view we can say that it \nmakes no sense to apply the mixture (95% of mineral oil \nand 5% of natural ester) of the maximum coefficient α. \nThis results from the fact that for such a mixture, this \ncoefficient is only by 1 -2% higher than for the \ncoefficient α of pure mineral oil. \nIn the case of retrofilling, i.e. replacing mineral oil \nwith ester (e.g. natural ester), we can expect that a few \npercent of oil will remain in the transformer in its hardly \navailable parts (paper insulation, crev ices). In this way, a \nmixture of oil and ester is created of the proportion 5/95. \nThe coefficient α of such a mixture (Table 7, Figure 6) is \nmuch lower than the coefficient α of pure mineral oil or \nthe mixture of the maximum value of α. Thus we can \nexpect that after retrofilling the transformer, the created \nmixture will have worse cooling properties. On the other \nhand, the coefficient α of the mixture is a slightly higher \nthan the coefficient α of pure natural ester. Thus we can \nexpect that after retrofilli ng the transformer, the created \nmixture will have better cooling properties than natural \nester. \nMeasured values of thermal properties of mixtures \n(thermal conductivity, kinematic viscosity, specific heat, \ndensity, and thermal expansion) were intermediate \nvalues of pure oil and pure natural ester. But coefficient \nα values, calculated using formula (1), were not \nintermediate values of pure oil and pure natural ester. \nThe coefficient α had some unexpected maximum, what \nis important results.  \nFuture investigations of a mixture with used mineral \noil and unused natural ester should be made in order to \nbetter understanding of thermal consequence of \nretrofilling the transformer. \nThe research was financed from resources of the Ministry of \nSciene and Higher Education for statutor y activities No. \n04/41/DS-PB/4293, name of the task: The Influence of Various \nParameters on Thermal Properties of Dielectric Liquids Used \nin High Voltage Transformer. \nReferences \n1.
