    "abstract": "The power sector contributes about 40% of global GHG emissions, and power transformers are an important physical component of the power sector. It is responsible for the transformation and distribution of electrical energy. It is necessary to obtain the GHG emissions of transformers. Based on the life cycle analysis, this paper establishes a transformer GHG emission model and determines the boundary of the calculation system as transformer raw material acquisition stage, assembly stage, transportation stage, operation stage, and end of life. Using the data of one 110 kV and one 220 kV transformer to calculate the GHG emissions in the life cycle, the results show that the power loss in operation dominates the GHG emissions in the transformer life cycle, contributing more than 96% of the GHG emissions. For power transformer GHG emissions, it is suggested to increase the utilization rate of transformer components to reduce power losses during operation.",
