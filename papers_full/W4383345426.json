    "abstract": "In recent years, with the rapid development of deep learning, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually become a powerful assistant for humans in various aspects. The maturity and advancement of natural language models led to the birth of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), generating great potential for healthcare applications. This review summarized the possible application prospects of ChatGPT in healthcare, assessed the limitations that still exist, and suggested possible improvements. In conclusion, the current version of ChatGPT can provide accurate and practical information for doctors and patients, help healthcare professionals to diagnose and treat, promote medical education, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the healthcare system, etc. However, ChatGPT still has some limitations, as issues such as the accuracy of the information, privacy of data, ethical and moral sentiments still need to be solved. In the future, scientists still need to make efforts to achieve more accurate and effective medical applications with ChatGPT or other AI model by enhancing model performance, filling the data gap, and promoting the standardization of ethical and copyright issues.",
