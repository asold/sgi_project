The  \nadvantages from a multi-method research design have  been clearly enunciated (e.g. Gable 1994). Kaplan and \nDuchon, 1988:575) suggest “Collecting different kin ds of data by different methods from different sour ces \nprovides a wider range of coverage that may result in a fuller picture of the research problem” … “it provides a \nricher, contextual basis for interpreting and valid ating results”. The virtues of combining case study  and survey \nmethods have been particularly touted (Gable 1994).  Nevertheless, multi-method research is uncommon; o ne of \nseveral deterrents being the management of large an d diverse data sets and related evolutionary, volum inous and \nunwieldy data analyses. Jemmont (2002) suggests the  challenge is “How to manage large data sets … How to \nkeep track of data … How to keep track of the ongoi ng analysis conducted.”  \nIt is suggested that most of these research data ma nagement challenges can be substantially ameliorate d through \nuse of appropriate software, and through adherence to underpinning methods and procedures. Additionall y, the \nelectronic capture of research data and related res earch results can facilitate views on the data not otherwise \npossible. “Researchers can link and compare pattern s within and across documents and the results can b e saved, \nprinted or undone at will” (Walsh, 2003, p. 253). W here data are methodically coded and stored in appr opriate \nrepositories, that collected in one phase can be re adily accessed and analysed efficiently along with data \ncollected in a subsequent phase of the research design.  \nThis paper presents a detailed narrative on how the  qualitative data analysis tool NVivo has been empl oyed \nacross an IS study as a comprehensive tool in suppo rt of the overall research effort. The primary purp ose of this \nnarrative is to provide the reader with an illustra tive demonstration of how the tool was applied with in the \nvarious stages of the referent multi-method study d esign. Emphasis herein, rather than on the qualitat ive data \nanalysis capabilities of NVivo, is on its virtues w hen applied more extensively and holistically; “you  can use \nNVivo to support research project management …. It is especially useful with large data sets, or when you may \nwish to return to data for re-analysis” (Action and  Research web page). NVivo can be used to support \nmanagement of research activity within each phase a nd across phases, and to evolve a repository which can be \nregularly revisited as data is gathered and analyse d as the research project matures and proceeds to s ubsequent \nphases.  \nThe remainder of this paper consists of six (6) sec tions. First, a brief introduction to the referent- study is \nprovided. Then, the NVivo tool is briefly introduce d. Next each of the three (3) main phases of the st udy \nwherein NVivo was employed (as depicted in Figure 1 ) is discussed in detail. Finally, lessons learnt a re \nsummarized. \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  7 \nThe paper will be of interest to (a) novice researc hers, as a reference in their research design effor ts; (b) \nacademics, involved in research training, where this narrative can be used as a rich teaching case and ; potentially \nto (c) vendors, of similar software tools, who may identify potential new tool applications and valuab le tool \nenhancements. \n \n \nFigure 1: Where NVivo was used in the referent-study \nTHE REFERENT-STUDY \nThe referent-study was of process modelling success  factors and measures. Business process modelling h as \ngained widespread acceptance, particularly in large IT-enabled business projects. It is applied as a process design \nand management technique across all project lifecyc le phases. While there has been much research on pr ocess \nmodelling (PM), there has been little attention to ‘how to’ conduct PM effectively, or on the evaluati on of PM \ninitiatives and outcomes. The referent study addres ses this gap by deriving a model of PM success fact ors \n(independent variables) and success dimensions (dep endent variables); addressing the two primary resea rch \nquestions: \nWhat are the critical antecedent factors of process modelling? \nHow can process modelling success be measured? \nThe referent-study employed a multi-method approach , blending both qualitative and quantitative resear ch \nmethods. The research design commenced with a compr ehensive literature review, including the first ann otated \nbibliography of process modelling research. A multi ple case study approach was used to build the conce ptual \nPM success model resulting in a model with eleven ( 11) success factors (namely - modeller expertise, t eam \nstructure, project management, user competence, use r participation, management support, leadership, \ncommunication, modelling tool, modelling language a nd modelling methodology), two (2) moderating varia bles \n(process complexity and project importance) and fiv e (5) process modelling success dimensions (modelle r \nsatisfaction, model quality, user satisfaction, mod el use and modelling impact). This conceptual model  was then \noperationalised and tested employing a global sampl e of respondents to an online survey instrument. 29 0 valid \nresponses were received. The PM model constructs we re analysed, seeking a parsimonious, valid and reli able \nmodel. NVivo was used across these core phases of the study to manage the overall research effort. \nINTRODUCING THE TOOL: NVIVO  \nNVivo is a computer program for qualitative data an alysis that allows one to import and code textual d ata, edit \nthe text; retrieve, review and recode coded data; s earch for combinations of words in the text or patt erns in the \ncoding; and import from or export data to other qua ntitative analysis software. NVivo was developed by  QSR \nInternational, the makers of NUD*IST. QSR’s first p roduct was created in 1981 (then called NUD*IST) to  \nsupport social science research and contained tools  for innovative ‘ Non-Numerical Unstructured Data Indexing \nSearching and Theorizing’. The product suites and services offered  by QSR have evolved over the years. The \nlatest version of the product was released in Febru ary 2006, called NVivo 7.0. However, this study use d NVivo \nversion 2.0. It takes time and effort to learn and master NVivo, and it is not the intention of this n arrative to \nprovide a tutorial on the tool in general. For spec ific details on the tool and its features, Exhibit 1 includes a list \nof selected useful resources. The remainder of this  paper is written assuming that the reader is famil iar with the \nbasic functionality and interfaces of NVivo 2.0. \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  8 \nNVivo is an easy-to-learn tool, because it works li ke the ‘old-loose-leaf’ binder that many qualitativ e researchers \nof the past are familiar with (Walsh, 2003, p. 253) . NVivo opens with a small window referred to as th e Launch \nPad (a.k.a Project Pad) which has four core tool fu nctions: (i) create a new project, (ii) open an exi sting project, \n(iii) open a tutorial, and (iv) exit the program (s ee Exhibit 2). The NVivo help, online tutorials and  the above \nmentioned resources (Exhibit 1), describe navigatio n and functionality in detail. This section next ve ry briefly \nintroduces several core elements of the tool, to ease subsequent discussion.  \nAll data is arranged around Documents  and Nodes – the two main working frameworks  within the tool. \nDocuments are simply data that one analyses in the study. All NVivo 2.0 documents are in rich text for mat. \nNodes are places where one stores ideas and categor ies. It is important to note the difference between  a code and \na node, in NVivo parlance. A Node is a physical loc ation where you store the groups of ideas that woul d be \ncoded. Thus, coding (putting things into codes) is a  process ; a way to label certain aspects of the data and to  sort \ninformation in distinct categories. The node on the  other hand holds all the information that has been  coded \nunder a certain category. Attributes  are properties assigned to nodes or documents. Onc e attributes are defined, \neach document or node will have specific values for  each attribute. These attribute values can be nume ric, string, \nBoolean or date-time type. These attributes can be usefully applied for better data management and eff ective \nsearches. The NVivo Search  tool can be used to search for strings, coding pat terns or attribute values in the \nproject database. These features enable the user to search for patterns across their data.  \nAPPLYING NVIVO IN THE LITERATURE REVIEW PHASE  \nThe literature review phase of this study had sever al goals. NVivo was used here as a qualitative data  analysis \ntechnique to synthesize and manage the plethora of literature with two primary intentions: \n•  to provide a holistic view of the current status of research in the study domain , and \n•  to provide a structured approach to writing a comprehensive literature review. \nThis section will describe how the tool was used to  pursue these goals. First, a justification of why a tool like \nNVivo is useful for a literature review is provided . Then the basic procedures to setup the tool in pr eparation for \na literature review are presented. This section clo ses with a step-by-step demonstration of how the to ol was used \nfor the two objectives listed above. \nWhy use a tool like NVivo for a literature review? \n“Literature reviews are a common feature of all dis sertations, regardless of discipline or subject mat ter. \nHowever, they are usually overlooked as a  form of qualitative analysis, yet the processes involved in  building \nan argument from a body of literature are similar t o processes involved in analysing qualitative data”  (Di \nGregario, 2000, p.2). There are other tools, like E NDNOTE, to support the bibliographic management asp ect of \na literature review. But qualitative software tools  like NVivo and ATLAS, can be used for the synthesi s process; \nthus, rather than being competitors, they complemen t. Di Gregario (2000, p 2) states “only NVivo (to d ate) has a \nparticular set of tools that is ideal for analysing literature”. \nGetting ready to use NVivo for the literature review \nThe first step in a literature review is to search and find relevant references pertaining to the topi c \n1. However, \nthis section assumes that the researcher has alread y completed searching and is focused on evaluating the \nextracted literature. It illustrates how the NVivo tool was used from the point of identifying a usefu l piece of \nwork; to the point of writing a synthesized literat ure review (thus the literature searching and extra cting \nstrategies are not discussed). \nWhenever possible, articles were saved in text form at and imported into NVivo directly. While this was  deemed \nuseful by the researcher, others who have used NViv o for similar purposes state that “ on a practical level, they \noccupy too much space ” (Di Gregario, 2000, p. 5) and that on an analytic al level, it is better to read and \nsummarize articles than include the entire work in the database. Regardless, in this study, the resear cher stored \nthe entire text version of the articles whenever it was available, and found this to be particularly useful to: \n•  search the entire collection of literature for a new key theme, \n•  compare notes and ideas collected from literature across a subset of researchers, and \n•  reference a single repository of literature (hence no need for any original copies stored elsewhere). \n                                                \n1 The detailed search strategies used for article identification in this study are not discussed here. \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  9 \nWhen the text version of an article was not availab le, a proxy document  was created to highlight the key \ninformation extractable from the article. A proxy d ocument is simply a representation of a particular piece of \nwork (i.e. like a set of summary notes resulting af ter reading an article; with page numbers, sample q uotes). In \nsuch situations the original version of the article  was saved in an external directory/folder and was considered a \ncomplementing element that belonged with the NVivo repository. \nAll these documents were maintained within NVivo’s Document view (see Exhibit 3), where documents were  \nsaved by authors’ name(s) and year.  \nDocument attributes were maintained for every docum ent in the database to enable effective analysis (s ee \nExhibit 1), including: \n•  Context  (to take note of sub sections of the discipline in  which the chosen articles’ emphasis/ \nspecialization is); \n•  Source type  (to indicate  the article was from the web, a book chapter, conference or journal); \n•  Source name (to maintain the exact name of the source (in abbreviated form \n2); \n•  Year ( to maintain the year of publication); \n•  Research method  (to maintain the reported research methodology/des ign applied (when not reported, a \ncategory as ‘unknown’ was used); \n \nExhibit 1: Getting started with NVivo \nWhen drafting the literature review for any piece o f work (e.g. article, thesis), it is a bonus if one  has a \npredefined conception of how ideas will be structur ed.  Most literature reviews share common themes li ke \n‘definitions of key concepts’, ‘historical overview  of the development of the discipline’. In preparat ion for \nwriting the literature review for the referent stud y, such a predefined set of themes was identified p rior to \nanalysing the articles, in order to assist the rese archer in identifying potential topic areas to extr act information \non.  These themes were then entered into NVivo as N odes – which formed a blank template of ‘folders’ t o help \nthe researcher codify the articles as she read; an ostensibly top-down approach to analysis. While rea ding \nthrough articles, useful or interesting new themes were identified, and the starting node list was ext ended to \ncodify emerging themes derived bottom-up from the l iterature. Thus, codification of the literature can  be \ndescribed as a joint  top-down and bottom-up  approach. \nWhile the discussion above described how the NVivo tool was set up for the literature review, the foll owing two \nsections will illustrate how NVivo assisted in addr essing the two main goals (listed above) of this st udy’s \nliterature review process. \nNVivo - an enabler to effectively illustrate the current status of a research domain  \nAs mentioned above, a primary goal of this analysis  was to provide a holistic view of the current stat us of \nresearch in the study domain. The domain under inve stigation in the referent study - Business Process \nModelling, is still very young, yet growing rapidly . Hence, early enumeration of  “primary process mod elling \nresearch outlets”, “primary research methods applie d within process modelling studies”, “process model ling \nresearch contexts”. proved useful for this, then no vice researcher in the field.  In example, Exhibit 2 depicts how \nthe primary process modelling research outlets were identified and analytically presented. \n                                                \n2 i.e. MISQ for Management Information Systems Quarterly Journal. Complete lists of these acronyms were maintained \nseparately as an index. \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  10 \nStep 1:   The documents were searched for, extracted and saved within NVivo as explained above. \nStep 2: The attributes of these were maintained while reading and coding the documents. \nStep 3:  The search features together with the basic ‘docum ent attribute explorer” were used to derive summary  \nstatistics of the attributes maintained. \nStep 4:  This information was manually extracted to Excel, from which graphs and summary tables were derived \nfor reporting purposes. \n \nExhibit 2: Illustration of how NVivo was used for identifying primary outlets and patterns of the discipline \nNVivo - an enabler to efficiently write a synthesized literature review \nThe other key reason for using NVivo in the literat ure review phase was to provide a structured approa ch to the \nprocess of writing the literature review. The steps followed to obtain this are described below. \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  11 \nStep 1:   The documents were searched for, extracted and saved within NVivo. \nStep 2: While reading the documents, useful information was  codified and saved within nodes. As explained \nearlier, these nodes were aligned with the draft st ructure of the literature review, and were used as ‘idea \nplacements’. \nStep 3:  Information within the nodes were extracted via th e ‘browse-node’ option to derive at the material  t hat \nwas to be used for fleshing out the content within each prior determined sub topic area. \nStep 4: This information was integrated into the draft write-up of the literature review. \nAPPLYING NVIVO FOR THE CASE STUDY PHASE  \nThe case study phase of the referent-study had three (3) primary goals:  \na)  To validate and re-specify the a-priori model that had been derived  \nb)  To aid in the design  of the subsequent survey, and  \nc)  To aid in analysing  the survey data  \nFirst, the basic procedures to setup the tool in pr eparation for case study analysis is presented. The  next sections \nwill describe how the tool supported the study to o btain these goals, with step by step demonstrative \nillustrations 3.  \nSetting up NVivo for case data analysis \n \nExhibit 3: Planning the codification process \nThe referent-study involved 9 case studies (where the unit of analysis was each process modelling project) across \n3 case sites (see Bandara et al., 2005 for specific  details). A new NVivo database was opened for each  new case \nsite, and all interview transcripts were loaded and  saved in the tool as ‘documents’ (as described ear lier). Each \ncase site was maintained in a separate database for  site-based analysis. A set of empty nodes were alr eady \ncreated, prior to any data analysis, to mirror the a-priori model that existed as at the beginning of each case study \nand a clear codification process was planned and fo llowed. As Exhibit 3 depicts, this process consiste d of three \ncore phases, each purporting to address one or more  of the case study objectives listed above. The ill ustrations in \nthe following sections will demonstrate how this co dification supported the overall analysis of the ca se study \ndata. \nUsing NVivo to validate and re-specify the a-priori model \n                                                \n3 An overview of the overall case study design is presented in detail in Bandara et al., (2005). \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  12 \nSeveral sub-analyses were conducted when validating  and re-specifying the a-priori model; in attention  to \nquestions such as:  \n•  are all the important constructs captured?  \n•  are there any constructs in the a-priori model that  are not critical or relevant for process modelling \nsuccess?  \n•  are any of the constructs identified redundant?  \n•  what type of relationships exist among the construc ts (e.g. do any constructs moderate the relationshi p \nwith success-factors and success-measures?)  \nOnce the data was codified (following the procedure s presented in Exhibit 3), the NVivo tool features such as \ncounts and searches were used to address these key questions. The following section provides several \nillustrations. Exhibit 4 graphically illustrates ho w NVivo was used to analyse proposed new constructs  for the \nmodel. \nStep 1: While the a-priori constructs were captured  as nodes in the case analysis phase, any new ideas  or themes \nthat were identified during the data codification/ analysis process were also captured, by codifying t hem under a \nnew node.  \nStep 2: When such a prospective construct was ident ified, prior analysed data was reviewed again to ma ke sure \nthat all possible data that relates to this newly f ound theme was captured. Sometimes basic text searc hes were \nconducted to support this checking process, where a  complete set of documents would be searched for by  \nincluding a search string that described, or was a synonym of, the newly identified construct.  \nStep 3: These new nodes also had the same structure  as depicted in Exhibit 3, where all general citati ons were \ncaptured together, and any specific positive or neg ative citations were coded as sub-nodes within. Fur thermore, \nthe general citations were also screened for potent ial sub-constructs (to support the survey design ph ase, if this \nnew construct was included in the final model).  \n- Are there any constructs in the a-priori model that are not really critical or relevant for the final model?  \nStep 1:  General counts of how many times a construct was m entioned, together with the number of times that \nthey were specifically mentioned as important or un important were captured as evidence to argue the in clusion \nor exclusion of a construct in the final model.  \nStep 2: These counts were extracted manually into summary g rids to capture all details in a holistic view, acr oss \nmultiple case studies (see Bandara et al., 2005 for a detailed example and discussion). \n- Are any of the constructs identified redundant?  \nIn order to test for any redundancy of the construc ts, Matrix Intersection, Matrix Difference and Prox imity tests \nwere conducted.  \nMatrix Intersection  search is a two-dimensional type of Boolean search  made available through NVivo. It takes \nthe searched feature from two collections at a time , and finds passages in the documents or nodes, in which the \nsearch term is contained in both. Matrix Difference  search, another type of NVivo Boolean search, take s one \nfeature from each collection at a time, and finds p assages in the documents or nodes having the featur e from the \nfirst collection but not the second. A proximity se arch finds passages with specific features which ar e close to \neach other. NVivo has five different types of Proximity searches ; Co-occurrence, Sequence, Inclusion, Matrix \nCo-occurrence, Matrix Sequence  and Matrix Inclusion \n4. A mixture of these was used based on the context of the \nconstructs that were tested for.  \n                                                \n4 Co-occurrence  finds places where text referred to by the first item is near text referred to by the second item.  \nSequence  finds places where text referred to by the first item is before text referred to by the second item.  \nInclusion  finds places where text referred to by the first item surrounds text referred to by the second item.  \nMatrix Co-occurrence  finds places where text referred to by items in the first group is pairwise near text referred to by items \nin the second group.  \nMatrix Sequence  finds places where text referred to by items in the first group is pairwise before text referred to by items in \nthe second group.  \nMatrix Inclusion  finds places where text referred to by items in the first group pairwise surrounds text referred to by items in \nthe second group (extracted from NVivo online help). \n \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  13 \nStep 1:  In order to identify areas of potential overlap be tween constructs, a basic Matrix Intersection searc h was \nfirst conducted. When an overlap was identified, th e content that was coded under both nodes was extra cted and \nanalyzed, simply by clicking on the cell(s) of the resulting Matrix Intersection search. \nStep 2: In order to identify if these constructs were actua lly different to each other, a basic Matrix Differe nce \nsearch was done with the two constructs been identified (very similar to Step 1). \n \nExhibit 4: Analysing new constructs \nStep 3: Different proximity searches were conducted to comp liment the information gathered in the above two \nsteps. The information extracted from these proximi ty tests sometimes supported the researcher to prov ide a \nmore synthesized explanation to support the reasoning of the analysis process. \n- What type of relationships existed with these constructs? \nThe process described above was also repeated with constructs that were hypothesized as moderating/ me diating \nvariables in the model. \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  14 \nStep 1: A basic Matrix Intersection search was conducted to  identify areas of overlap. The text extracted from  \nthese was analyzed very carefully to assist in iden tifying any moderating/ mediating relationships bet ween the \nconstructs. \nStep 2: Proximity checks were conducted in parallel to thes e matrix searches to assist in identifying where a \nconstruct most often would fit in the model. \nThe results from these various tests were analyzed in conjunction with each other, when the final deci sions on \nthe case data based model re-specification took pla ce [see Bandara et al., (2005) for a detailed examp le]. For \nexample, an a-priori construct may be deleted for one or more of the following reasons;  \n•  having only  a few general citations, and /or \n•  having  one or two strong citations for its irrelevance as a construct, and /or \n•  the data coded under this construct also been coded  under another – hence depicting possible \nredundancy or overlap \n•  Similarly, a new construct may be included based on one or more of the following reasons;  \n•  having many general citations, stating this new con struct, and /or having one or two strong citations for \nits high relevance as a construct, and /or an overa rching theme (construct) been identified that captu res \nmore than one of the a-priori constructs \n5. \nUsing NVivo to aid in the subsequent survey phase \nThe case study data was also used to support in the  design of the survey; the preceding phase of the s tudy. This \nwas primarily in relation to (a) deriving the corre ct set of constructs, (b) deriving the hypothesis t o be tested and \n(c) identifying potential evidence to form the items. (a) and (b) were described in detail earlier.  \nStep 1:  As described in phase 3 of Exhibit 3; any potentia l sub constructs that were identifiable from the da ta \nwere maintained separately under each construct node.  \nStep 2 : All the potential sub constructs across all case studies were extracted and systematically reviewed with \nfurther evidence from literature to derive the surv ey items of this study.  Data stored within these n odes were \nused as evidence to derive and justify instrument items. \nData maintained within the NVivo case databases, we re also used in the later survey analysis phase whe n further \nevidence to an observation was sought for. For inst ance, when a general observation made through the c ase \nstudy data was further tested with quantitative dat a gathered through the survey, quotes from the case  data were \nextracted (when relevant) as further evidence and explanation of the survey analysis results. \nAPPLYING NVIVO FOR THE SURVEY PHASE  \nThe survey designed from this study consisted of a range of close and open ended questions (qualitativ e data) \nthat had to be analysed and new scales (some catego rical, some interval) that were used for the first time. NVivo \nwas used within this phase to: \na)  assist in analysing the open ended qualitative data fields, and \nb)  assist validate selected categorical scales used in the instrument.  \nSee Table 1 for an overview of when NVivo was used and for what goal.  \nThe following sections will take one example relating to each of the three objectives listed above and illustrate in \ndetail how the tool was applied. \n \n                                                \n5 Identified by advanced matrix searches \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  15 \n Construct under \ninvestigation \nSurvey question Purpose of using  NVivo \n1 Respondents’ role If you selected ’other’, please \nbriefly describe your role: \n(a) /barb2right To identify what the other roles are. \n2 Respondents’ training \nprofile \nIf you received other forms of \ntraining, please specify them here: \n/barb2right To identify what the other training options \nwere, and \n(b) /barb2right To validate the training scale that was used \nfor the first time in this study. \n3 Modelling Objectives …. list the process modelling \nobjectives : \n/barb2right To identify what the other objectives were, and \n(b) /barb2right To validate the process modelling objective \nscale that was adopted from a prior study (Davies \net al, 2005). \n4 Modelling Tool Please specify up to 5 process \nmodelling tools used in the project \nand indicate the tool that was used \nmost. \n/barb2right To identify what the primary and secondary \nmodelling tools were. \n \n7 Modelling Technique Please specify up to 5 process \nmodelling techniques used in the \nproject and indicate the single \ntechnique that was used most \n(a) /barb2right To identify what the primary and secondary \nmodelling techniques were. \n \nTable 1: Where NVivo was applied to support the analysis of the survey data \nUsing NVivo to analyse the open ended qualitative data fields \nThis section will illustrate how the tool was used to derive a classification of primary modelling too ls reported \nfrom the 290 responses in the survey database. Exhibit 5 depicts this process in a graphical view. \nStep 1:  The single column with all the documented modellin g tools was extracted from the original data file a nd \nsaved as a text file.  \nStep 2:  This file was then exported to NVivo as a document. \nStep 3:  A complete data driven-bottom-up approach was used  to map these statements with potential tool types.  \nEach line of text was analysed to see, if that stat ement could be associated with a type of tool. A ne w node was \ncreated for every first mention of a tool name (not e that every tool name was checked for its existenc e using a \nweb search \n6, prior to recording in the database) and the relev ant statements were codified under these nodes. \nWhen a statement related to an existing tool node, it was coded under that node, thus populating the d ifferent \ncategories as the analysis took place. All statemen ts were coded under only one category. Any doubts o r self \nnotes were also captured in the process with NVivo memos. \nStep 4 : Summary statistics of this mapping process was derived from NVivo.  \nStep 5: These details were (manually) extracted to Excel, which was then used to derive the relevant g raphs and \ninterpretations. \nUsing NVivo to validate selected categorical scales used in the instrument  \nThis section illustrates how the tool was used to test and validate the ‘modelling objectives’ scale u sed. Exhibit 6 \ndepicts this process in a graphical view. In this e xample, a scale already existed to capture the resp onses in prior \nestablished clusters, and only the open ended “othe rs” section had to be analysed using NVivo. \n                                                \n6 Typing the search term “<Name of the tool proposed >, modeling, tool” in Google.  \n \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  16 \n \nExhibit 5: Detailed illustration of how NVivo was used to identify the primary tools used \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  17 \n \nExhibit 6: Detailed illustration of how NVivo was used to identify the primary modelling objectives \n \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  18 \nStep 1:  A frequency distribution was derived to view the n umber of citations for each of the existing categor ies \nof the original scale (from within the raw data saved in excel). \nStep 2: The single column with all the documented ‘other’ m odelling objectives was extracted from the original  \ndata file and saved as a text file.  \nStep 3:  This file was then exported to NVivo as a document. \nStep 4:  Single nodes were created within NVivo to correspo nd with each of the existing categories in the \noriginal scale.   \nStep 5:  This time a combined top down and bottom up approa ch was used to map these statements with \nmodelling objectives. The ‘other’ mentioned objecti ves were first analysed to see if they related to a n already \nexisting modelling objective from the original list . If they did, they were mapped on to the single on e that best \nmatched with the description provided. If not, a ne w node was created to capture this new statement. L ike \nbefore, all statements were coded only once and memos were maintained with any notes when deemed relevant.  \nStep 6:  Summary statistics of this mapping process was derived from NVivo.  \nStep 7:  These details were (manually) extracted to Excel. The original frequencies were adjusted to \naccommodate the results of this mapping process. Re levant graphs and interpretations were derived from  this \nanalysis. \nLESSONS LEARNT \nThe researcher was a novice to qualitative research  in general and to the use of qualitative tools lik e NVivo. \nWhile the use of the tool has been an immense asset  to manage the plethora of data and ideas cross man y \ndifferent phases of a long term research study, a l ot of learning’s were gathered through this trail a nd error \nprocess. These are summarized below, after categori zing them into two groups: limitations due to lack of \nexpertise and those that are tool related. \nLimitations due to lack of expertise \nWhile the tool was used extensively across the diff erent phases of the study, not all sub-phases were supported \nwith NVivo. For example, a significant effort was p ut into identifying literature to support the item derivation \nprocess. This could have been better managed with t he use of a tool like NVivo.  There were some funct ionality \nwithin the tool that the researcher did not have kn owledge of (such as the use of ‘sets’, some advance d search \noptions and the modelling capability). For example,  the model functionality could have been used to id entify \ndirect relationships between published studies and sets could have been used to better organise the li terature \nbased on different demographic aspects of the paper  origins. The research management of this study via  NVivo \nmay have been further improved if these had been us ed. Further more, the researcher could have maintai ned a \nresearch journal via the tool to capture not only t he process but also the thoughts and the tacit know ledge \nassociated with the process of analysing the data f rom the start, to the end of the study. This would have been a \nuseful monograph for novice researchers and research trainers. \nWeaknesses due to limitations in the tool \nSome tasks associated with the process described he re could have made easier with minor improvements o f the \ntool. These are documented here with the goal of reaching potential tool vendors. \nNVivo only worked directly with a limited range of file types and requires the researcher to convert the data files \nto plain text formats, which takes away the formatt ing of the documents and makes the context ‘messy’ to read \nand interpret. This also makes it difficult to impo rt important information which may be formatted as tables or \nfootnotes. It is impossible to maintain non-text in formation within the tool. Ironically, in many scen arios of \nqualitative research, non-text data plays a crucial  role in the analysis process, but the tool unfortu nately does not \nsupport this. It would have been very useful to hav e a direct interface with Excel, especially where r eports and \nsearch results from various queries can be exported directly to excel or word. The overall graphical user interface \nof the tool can also be improved to ease navigation and customizability. \nCONCLUSION \nThis paper demonstrated how NVivo is used across a multi-method study design as a research management tool. \nThis narrative was utilised in an advanced-IT-resea rch –methods-training unit offered by the Faculty o f IT, QUT \nto test its suitability as a teaching and learning tool. Feedback received has been positive. Some sam ple quotes \ninclude:  \nBandara Using NVivo as a Research Management Tool: a Case Narrative \nQualIT2006  19 \n“I know that qualititative data analysis tools can assist in analysing text, but never realised that i t can be \napplied in a multimethod project as an overall research management tool until I saw this example”  \n“The level of detail in the narrative as to where t o find the functionality is exactly what I needed t o help me plan \nmy own study” \n(Feedback received from students enrolled in ITN 269- Advanced Research Methods in IT, Faculty of It, QUT, Sem 2, 2006) \n \nNVivo is only one qualitative data analysis tool ma de available. There are many more in the market, he nce it is \nadvisable to review tool comparison articles prior to selecting a tool for this type of research manag ement \npurposes. Furthermore, “NVivo, or any Qualitative data analysis tool for t hat matter does not eliminate the need \nfor the researcher to think …”  (Jemmont, 2002, p.7). It is only as affective as o ne applies it. Hence for success, \nit is recommended that the (a) basic tool functiona lities (‘ what can the software do’) are clearly  understood and \n(b) the researcher creatively seeks ways to apply t hese functionalities for different purposes within different \ncontexts. In terms of tool functionalities, (ai) tr aining resources (books, user manuals, online help and \nworkshops) are very useful. (aii) Tutorials embedde d with the tools are also a useful asset for this p urpose. In \nterms of (b) creative ideas on how to utilize the t ool, the novice researcher can benefit significantl y from (bi) \ndescriptive narratives (of this paper’s nature) and  (bii) continuous hand-on practice. \nREFERENCES \nAction and Research web page, http://www2.fhs.usyd.edu.au/arow/r/res/nvivo.htm , last accessed April, 16 th , \n2006. \nBandara, W., Gable, G. and Rosemann, M. 2005, “ Factors and Measures of business process modelling: Model \nbuilding through a multiple case study ”, European Journal of Information Systems, 14, p. 347-360. \nDavies, I., Green, P., Rosemann, M., Indulska, M., and Gallo, S. 2005, “ Conceptual modelling in practice - The \nimpact of organizational size and experience to appear in data and knowledge engineering . - The \nimpact of organizational size and experience”, to appear in data and knowledge engineering. \nDi Gregario, S, 2000, \" Using NVivo for your Literature Review\",  Strategies in qualitative Research: Issues and \nResults from Analysis Using QSR NVivo and NUD*IST Conference at the institute of Education, \nLondon 29-30 September. \nGable, G., G. 1994, \"I ntegrating Case Study and Survey research methods: an example in Information Systems \", \nEuropean Foundation of Information Systems, (3:2), p.112-126. \nJemmott, H. 2002, \" Using Nvivo in Qualitative Data Analysis \", Journal of Research in Education.
