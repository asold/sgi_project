  "abstract": "The article presents the calculation of the leakage inductance in power transformers. As a rule, the leakage flux in the transformer window is represented by the short-circuit inductance, which affects the short-circuit voltage, and this is a very important factor for power transformers. This inductance reflects the typical windings of power transformers well, but is insufficient for special transformers or in any case of the internal asymmetry of windings. This paper presents a methodology for calculations of the self- and mutual-leakage inductances for windings arbitrarily located in the air window. It is based on the 2D approach for analyzing the stray field in the air zone only, using discrete partial differential operators. That methodology is verified with the finite element method tested on real transformer data.",
