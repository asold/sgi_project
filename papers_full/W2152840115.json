The timely monitoring of this ability is import-\nant when his/her performance enhancement is concerned. Though the existing\nmethodologies to assess ones cognitive abilities in the form of mathematical,\nlinguistic-aptitude questionnaires, face to face interaction are well established,\npracticing these techniques in the present day scenario seems to be time consum-\ning and less appealing, especially in case on online training programmes. Also,\nmany current assessment techniques stress on task completion rather than the\noverall process responsible for it. To improve the quality of the output, be it a task\nperformance or a skill attainment, the entire process of it has to be monitored and\nevaluated [1].\nToday computer games are being developed not only for entertainment of the\nplayers but in the field of health and education to improve one or more cognitive\n© 2014 Navalyal and Gavas; licensee Springer.

Brain Computer Interface is one technology, which has facili-\ntated the assessment of user behaviour through games [2]. These games can enhance\nproblem solving abilities in children. Many“Serious” games for health and education\nfor children are also popular [3].\nThe states of the brain can be recorded in a non-invasive and a flexible way through\nElectroencephalogram (EEG) [4]. Research has shown that EEG based applications were\nfirst developed to help disabled people to communicate with machines [5,6], then they\nwere used in video games as game controllers [7] and then in Neurofeedback Games\n[8]. Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) syndrome are\ntreated primarily with behavioural therapy than pharmacologically, as medications are\nbound to cause side effects [9-11].\nAlso training programs to help children , to focus and improve mental skills are\nincreasingly becoming popular. Abacus is one such training program designed to\ndevelop math solving skills in children in the age groups of five to fourteen. This\nprogram is divided into many levels with increased complexity in solving skills at\neach level. The skills acquired at each of the levels are manually tested by specifying time\nlimits to complete a calculation. This can be a burden on the trainer to make observations\nof a trainee’s performance before he/she is allowed to take up the next level.\nThese existing techniques test the trainees solving skills, which also reflect their\nattention and concentration levels. So as an alternative measure, the trainees can\nbe tested for their improvement in concen tration at different stages and their\nprogress tracked. It can also aid self evaluation to the user. This paper shows a game\nimplementation to test the progress of the trainees with a more flexible and\ninteresting approach. It is a simple gaming application using visualization tech-\nniques to increase enthusiasm without b eing aware of being tested. As the system\nmakes use of a subject ’s direct attention to control a game, it works on a feed-\nforward mechanism [12].\nAs inexpensive, wireless, portable and easy-to-use EEG headsets are available in the\nmarket from vendors like Neurosky and Emotiv [13,14], BCI game implementations\nhave become very easy and assessing attention and meditation values of the users are\nfound to be reliable [15].\nSection 3 deals with the proposed game design philosophy. Game implementation\ndetails are discussed in section 4 and 5. Results of the implementation are discussed in\nsection 6. In section 7 and 8, the conclusion and future work are discussed.\nGame design\nAny gaming application uses a graphics tool for the design of the gaming environment\nand user interface along with devices like keyboard, mouse or a joystick type of control-\nlers to control the game. An EEG based game uses“thoughts” to control game. Our\nimplementation uses OpenGL software for designing the gaming environment and an\nEEG device and its driver software from Neurosky.\nThe game design schema was done by taking into consideration the following points:\nThe hardware used should be inexpensive and easy to maintain. It should use simple\nGUI so as to make a novice get accustomed to it in a short span. It was also necessary\nfor it to use neurofeedback to give a visual representation of his attention levels and\nthus aid him to enhance it in a rather playful manner.\nNavalyal and GavasHuman-centric Computing and Information Sciences2014, 4:11 Page 2 of 7\nhttp://www.hcis-journal.com/content/4/1/11\nGame implementation\nThe hardware includes a Lenovo Intel i5 processor based laptop and EEG device\n“Mindwave Mobile” from Neurosky. The implementation platform is Windows 7 and\nthe game is developed using Visual C++ with OpenGL graphics library.\nDetails of NeuroSky Mindwave mobile EEG\nSoftware\nThinkgear software provided with the EEG device is used to connect the EEG device to the\ncomputer. It allows special applications andgames to be run according to the states of mind\nas detected by EEG headset with NeuroSky’s ThinkGear sensor. It runs as a background\nprocess continuously by keeping an open socket on the computer system, thereby allowing\napplications to connect to it. The applications receive information from the connected\nThinkGear devices. It is provided as an executable for Mac OS X and Windows platforms.\nHardware\nThe device is a single lobe, dry sensor electrode based, non-invasive EEG device.\nThinkGear is the technology which is embedded in every NeuroSky product. It\nenables connectivity with brainwaves of the wearer. It comprises of a sensor that\ntouches the forehead to collect brain wave data centered at the frontal cortex, the con-\ntact and the reference points located on the ear pad. The data is processed using the\nonboard chip included on it. Both the eSense Meters (Meditation and Attention) and\nraw brainwaves are calculated on the ThinkGear Chip.\nSignal acquisition\nThe MindWave Mobile Headset includes the sensor that touches the forehead, the con-\ntact and reference points located on the ear pad, and the onboard chip that processes\nall of the data and provides this data to software and applications in digital form\nthrough Bluetooth connectivity. Figure 1 shows the setup for the game.\nThe EEG electrode is placed on the user’s forehead (on the frontal cortex) during the\nplay. The headset safely measures and outputs the EEG power spectrums (alpha waves,\nbeta waves, etc), attention, meditation and eye blink values. Attention and Meditation\nare indicated and reported on a meter with a relative eSense scale of 1 to 100.\nThis scale has a set of grouping schemata for the ranges of values and a particular state of\nmind is attributed to it. Values between 20-40 are reduced levels and from 1-20 they are\nconsidered strongly lowered eSense. A valuelying in the range of 40-60 is considered to be\nneutral. Values above 60 are consideredto be values higher than the normal or“slightly ele-\nvated”. Values in the range of 80-100 are considered to be high levels of eSense.\nAttention as an unsigned one-byte value indicates the intensity of a user’s level of\nmental “focus” or “attention”, such as that which occurs during intense concentration\nand directed (but stable) mental activity. Its value ranges from 0 to 100. Distractions,\nwandering thoughts, lack of focus or anxiety lower the Attention meter levels.\nGaming strategy\nThe input to this gaming application is through the attention values. The 3D ball moves\nfrom a source location to a destination location when the users focus on the task been\nassigned to them. Our implementation uses the eSense value 50 as a threshold value for a\nNavalyal and GavasHuman-centric Computing and Information Sciences2014, 4:11 Page 3 of 7\nhttp://www.hcis-journal.com/content/4/1/11\nfair attention value, since it is the middlemost value lying on the eSense scale and is con-\nsidered to be average balanced state of mind. When this value is crossed, the players ball\nmoves forward towards the destination else it descends. On reaching the destination, a\ngolden pot appears on the screen as a reward of the achievement.\nMethodology\nThe subjects were devoid of any mental or physical disabilities and normal environ-\nmental conditions prevailed during the experimentation.\nEEG data was gathered from subjects from 4 different areas and age groups.\nAreas included 13 Abacus students (8-Males, 5-Females) in the age groups of 6 -15 years,\n3 under graduate students (2-males, 1-Female) in the age group of 20– 22, 3 professionals\n(2-Males, 1-Female) in the age groups of 40– 50 and 2 senior citizens (1-Male, 1-Female)\nabove 60 years. All of them hailed from Karnataka, India. Out of the four groups, for\ntwo groups the data was collected when th ey were involved in mental activities\nperforming a task, than using the gaming tool. The subjects involved in the experi-\nmentation were either playing a game or involved in a mental activity and each of\nthese activities induce a perceptible concentration level in the participants which the\napplication records. The recorded data are further evaluated.\nAlgorithm\nThe following algorithm defines work flow of the proposed BCI game. The second\nstep in the algorithm comprises of setting up proper connectivity with the EEG de-\nvice and the system, initializing OpenGL features like lighting, shading and material\nproperties and drawing the required graphics objects on the OpenGL window.\nInput: Attention eSense values.\nOutput: Attention assessment using computer graphics.\nFigure 1Block Diagram of the proposed implementation.\nNavalyal and GavasHuman-centric Computing and Information Sciences2014, 4:11 Page 4 of 7\nhttp://www.hcis-journal.com/content/4/1/11\n1. Start.\n2. Set up the environment for the game.\n3. Read the input and start the timer.\n4. If (input value > threshold).\nMove the graphics object forward.\nElse.\nMove it backward.\n5. When the graphics object reaches the destination, stop timer.\n6. Stop.\nFigure 2 shows the snapshot of the BCI game developed using OpenGL.\nResults\nFigure 3 shows the graph of abacus training levels on the X-axis and the time taken in\nseconds to accomplish the BCI task assigned to them on the Y-axis.\nThe experimentation was carried out on students from various levels of abacus\ntraining. The students in the lower abacus training levels deal with simple addition\nand subtraction problems. Hence they performed better.\nThe students in the higher abacus training levels had to perform floating point\ncalculations and were given multiple operations, so switching between multiple tasks\nhindered their attention. But the students, who had practised for more time in every\nlevel, did not panic and could perform calculations at higher attention levels.\nNervousness curbs attention values whereas confidence, self-esteem enhances it.\nFigure 4 shows the graph of the age of non-abacus practitioners in years on the\nX-axis and the time taken in seconds to play the game on the Y-axis.\nAttention can be divided into classes of ages. Too young (below 10 years) and too old\nones (above 70 years) lack attention whereas teenagers are consistent in this regard.\nFigure 2Snapshot of the BCI game.\nNavalyal and GavasHuman-centric Computing and Information Sciences2014, 4:11 Page 5 of 7\nhttp://www.hcis-journal.com/content/4/1/11\nFurther it considerably reduces with age. The subjects selected were not trained with\nspecial mental skills.\nThe linear trendline is a best-fit straight line for the data sets obtained which follows\nthe equation given below to calculate the least squares fit for a line:\ny = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the intercept.\nThe application was tested on an assortment of subjects from mind training institutes\nlike abacus institute. Surprisingly, these subjects could navigate the sphere with greater\nease in contrast with the normal subjects.\nConclusion\nAs a summary, the paper draws sharp inferences of the mental activities with\nconjunction to the factors like age, mental training, etc. The visual game aids as a\ntool in this regard. The graphical analysis reveals the correlation that exists\nbetween the attention values and their enhancement for subjects undergoing\nmental training skills like abacus and non-abacus subjects. It also reveals the\nFigure 3Graph showing the time taken to complete the given BCI task by abacus students at\ndifferent levels of training.\nFigure 4Graph showing the time taken by non-abacus practitioners to play the BCI game.\nNavalyal and GavasHuman-centric Computing and Information Sciences2014, 4:11 Page 6 of 7\nhttp://www.hcis-journal.com/content/4/1/11\nbenefits of such training programmes. The application has the ability of providing\nfeedback to children on their performance and monitoring their progress over time.\nFuture work\nVisual modelling features of OpenGL can be added to distract a user during the game,\nwhich through control of thoughts could be overcome and could aid children with\nADHD disorder to improve concentration. Playing such games on regular basis could\nenhance one’s attention and focussing capabilities considerably.\nAuthors’ contributions\nBoth the authors, GU and RG, have equally contributed in implementation of the proposed system, data acquisition and\nanalysis, and documentation.
