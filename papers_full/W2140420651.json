Introduction\nCurrent transformer (CT) is an instrument transformer specially \ndesigned and assembled to be used in measurement, control, and \nprotective circuits. Its primary circuit consists of a few turns – some-\ntimes even a single turn – and is connected in serie with the circuit \nwhose current is desired to be measured, and the secondary circuit \nis connected to the current-measuring instruments.\nThe theory about CT is basically the same of any other iron-core \ntransformer. The secondary circuit is closed through the typical low \nimpedance of the instruments connected to it. Normally, these are 5 A \ninstruments. The voltage across the secondary terminals is the drop \nthrough the instruments and loads, and usually is only a few volts. \nThe voltage across the primary terminals is approximately the voltage \nreferred to the primary, and can be only a fraction of a volt. \nIn the ideal CT, the secondary current is inversely proportional \nto the ratio of turns and oppositive in phase to the impressed primary \ncurrent. However, an exact inverse proportionality and phase relation \nare not possible because part of the primary current must be used \nto excite the magnetic material of the core. So, the exciting current \nmust be subtracted phasorially from the primary current to find the \namount remaining to supply secondary current. This value will be \nslightly different from the value that the ratio of turns would indicate \nand there is a slight shift in the phase relationship. This results in \nthe introduction of ratio and phase angle errors when compared to \nthe ideal CT.\nSince the exciting current alters the ratio and phase angle of \nthe primary and secondary currents, it is made as small as possible \nthrough the use of high permeability and low loss magnetic materials \nin the construction of the core, such as silicon steel and amorphous \nalloys. In many industrial applications, designers need to select the \nmagnetic core material and its shape. Each specific application de -\nmands the development of a specific core shape. Therefore, they all \nhave advantages and drawback; for instance, toroidal cores are more \ncompact than E-cores and their material cost is lower due to single \ncomponent and tighter magnetic coupling1.\nIn this work, it is presented a study about the possibilities of \napplication of nanocrystalline alloys in toroidal cores for current \ntransformers. \n2. Analytical Study and Some \nDesign Considerations\nCurrent transformers are characterized by some relationships. \nThe first is the marked ratio of the primary current to the secondary \ncurrent (Kc = Ipn / Isn), and is indicated by the manufacturer. This ratio \nis a fixed and permanent value for a given current transformer. The \nsecond is the true ratio of the rms primary current to the rms second-\nary current (Kr = Ip / Is) under specified conditions. The true ratio of a \ncurrent transformer is not a single fixed value, since it depends on the \nspecified conditions of use, such as secondary burden ( Zc), primary \ncurrent (Ip), frequency (f), and wave form. The third is the ratio cor-\nrection factor (RCF). It is the factor by which the marked ratio must \nbe multiplied to obtain the true ratio (RCF = Kr / Kc).\nThe CT errors exist due to the exciting current Ie at the magnet-\nizing branch Zm. The primary impedance do not affects the CT errors \nand it is represented by a low-impedance in serie with the system \ncircuit where the CT is installed, which value can be neglected. After \n396 Luciano et al. Materials Research\nthese considerations, Figure 1 can represent the CT electrical model, \nwhere Zs is the secondary impedance.\n2.1. Phase angle\nThe phase angle of a current transformer, designated by the \nGreek letter b, is the angle between the current leaving the identi -\nfied secondary terminal and the current entering the identified \nprimary terminal, under specified conditions 2. It is apparent from \nFigure 2 that the reversed secondary current I2 is not in phase \nwith the impressed primary current I1, there is an angle between \nthem, the phase angle b. This angle is considered positive when \nthe secondary current leads the primary current and it is usually \nexpressed in minutes. \nIn this Figure, φ is the magnetizing flux and I0 is the exciting \ncurrent with its two components: Iµ, the magnetizing current, and Ip, \nthe active losses current. In the secondary circuit: E2 is the induced \nelectromotive force, r2 is the winding resistance, x2 is the leakage \nreactance, U2 is the terminal voltage, I2 is the secondary current, and \nθ2 is the angle between U2 and I2. In addition, it can be seen that the \nprimary current I1 is obtained by phasor sum of I0 and (– n2 / n1). I2, \nwhere n2 and n1 are the number of turns of the secondary and primary \nwindings, respectively.\n2.2. The influence of the primary and the secondary currents \non the CT errors\nThe ratio error εc is defined as the percent relative difference be-\ntween the measured value of the primary current and its exact value, \nas expressed by the equation: \n. . %\nI\nK I I 100c\nr\n1\n2 1f = -  (1)\nOn the other hand, the phase angle error is defined as the angle b \npresented on the phasor diagram of the CT in Figure 2.\nThe main reason for the ratio and phase angle errors of a current \ntransformer is the exciting current I0. In an ideal TC, in which I0 does \nnot exist, I1 and – (n2 / n1). I2 presented in Figure 2 are coincident. \nThus, the primary current value, obtained from the secondary current, \nwould be equal to the absolute value of the vector I1 from the phasor \ndiagram, and this vector would be delayed from I2 of exactly 180°.\nIn conventional transformers, the exciting current is considered \nconstant, and its absolute value and phase can be determined by open-\ncircuit test. However, this is not true in CT. In a current transformer the \nexciting current is not constant, neither in its absolute value nor in its \nphase, due to the great influence of the non-linearity of the magnetic \nmaterial of which its core is made. Due to the relation between the \nprimary and the exciting currents, the smaller the value of the first \none, the greater the influence of the second, what increases the ratio \nand phase angle errors of the CT. That is why, when determining the \naccuracy class of a CT, the technical norms allow the CT to present \nbigger errors when tested with 10% of the primary nominal current \nthan when it is tested with its exact value.\nAnalysing Figure 2, it can be verified the influence of the exciting \nand the primary currents on the errors of a CT. In this figure, projecting \nthe vectors Io  and I2 over the vector I1, it is obtained:\n. . . ( )cos cosI K I I 90c o1 2 cb a b d= + - + +7 A (2)\nwhere α is the angle between the exciting current Io  and the mag -\nnetizing flux z, and δ is the angle between the inverse of I2 and the \ninverse of E2.\nDue to its relatively small value, the angle b can be neglected, \nsimplifying the previous expression:\nZm Zc\nZS\nIs\nIe\nIp\nFigure 1.

Then, it is important that the magnetic \nmaterial of the CT core could demand a small exciting current to be \nmagnetized and, also, that the CT could be projected to operate with \na primary current value as near as possible of its nominal value, in \norder to minimize the effects of the primary current in its errors.\nIn turn, the secondary current of a CT is extremely dependent of \nits primary current, and it is not influenced by the impedance of the \nelement connected to the secondary terminals of the CT. However, if \nthis impedance exceeds some limit values, determined by the maxi-\nmum power with which the accuracy class of the CT was obtained, \nthe errors can be much greater than those obtained with the tests.\nWhen an impedance Z is connected to the secondary of a CT, a \ncurrent I2 flows through it and the ratio and phase angle errors εc and \nb, respectively, can be determined by Equations 4 and 6. When the \nabsolute value of Z increases, keeping its phase unchanged, it is nec-\nessary an increase of the secondary voltage U2 so that the secondary \ncurrent I2 could stay constant. To achieve this aim, the electromotive \nforce E2 has to increase its absolute value and so on the flux ϕ inside \nthe core. As this flux is produced by the exciting current Io, it must \nalso increase its absolute value, increasing the ratio and phase angle \nerrors. This analysis of the influence of the secondary current on the \nCT errors is important, because it alerts about the resistance limit of \nthe conductors that could be used to connect the secondary windings \nof the CT to the equipments that they will supply.\n2.3. Some design considerations\nAn essential part of the transformer design consists of the deter-\nmination of the magnetic cross-section area (Amag) and the conductors \ncross-section area. These areas are determined from estimations of \nsuitable values for the peak flux density Bm; the full-load rms current \ndensity J in the windings, that depends on the way transformers will \nbe used, intermittently or continuously; the winding space factor kw; \nand the stacking factor ks.\nThe primary and secondary windings must be accommodated in \nthe window area Aw. The winding space factor kw is defined as the \nratio between the total conductor cross-section area and the window \narea. Insulation and clearance reduce the available area for actual \nconductor cross-section to kw.Aw. The full-load rms current density in \nthe windings J is limited by r.I2 loss and heat dissipation. The stacking \nfactor ks is defined as the ratio between the magnetic cross-section \narea and the total core cross-section area.\nAs nanocrystalline materials are produced in the form of ribbons, \nit is available toroidal cores with square or rectangular cross-section, \nas shown in Figure 3.\nThe dimensioning of the magnetic circuit starts with the deter -\nmination of the magnetic cross-section area, given by: \nAmag = kS.Ageo (7) \nwhere Ageo is the geometric cross-section area.\nThe medium length of the magnetic circuit is given by:\nl OD ID\n2mag r= +b l (8)\nThe number of each winding turns N is obtained by the equa -\ntion:\n. . .N k f B A\nV\nf m mag\n=  (9)\nwhere V is the rated rms voltage, f is the frequency of the signals, \nand kf is the form factor (equal to 4.44 for sine wave and equal to \n4.0 for square wave).\nThe cross-section areas of the two windings, the primary (Ap) and \nsecondary (As), are determined considering the full-load rms current \ndensity in the winding and the work rate of the transformer, by the \nfollowing relationships:\n.A J V\nS\np\n1\n=  (10) \n.A J V\nS\ns\n2\n=  (11) \nBecause of the m.m.f. balance ( N1.I1 = N2.I2), each one of the \nprimary and secondary windings occupy about one-half of the avail-\nable area, so that the primary current linkage is N1.I1 = (1/2).kw.Aw.J \nand the rms value of the current is given by:\n.\n. .I N\nk A J\n2rms\nw w\n=  (12) \nwhere Aw is the geometrical core window area and kw is the winding \nfactor.\nBy Faraday’s law, for sinusoidal wave, the rms value of the \nvoltage is:\nVrms = 4.44.f.N.Amag.Bm (13)\nTherefore, as Vrms = S/Irms, the transformer volt-ampere rating is \ngiven by:\nS = 2.22.f.Bm.J.Kw.Aw.Amag (14) \nIt is shown in Equation 14 that the transformer volt-ampere \nrating is proportional to the product of the available window area \nof the core multiplied by the magnetic cross-section area, which \nis called area product. There is a unique relationship between this \narea product, characteristic value for transformer cores, and several \nother important parameters that must be considered in transformers \ndesign, such as volume, weight, surface area and current density, for \na given temperature rise3.\nUsing Ampère’s law, and considering the total m.m.f. for a peak \nflux density as Hmlmag, where lmag is the mean length of the flux path \naround the magnetic circuit, the magnetizing current Im in the N1 turns \nof the primary windings, ignoring harmonics, is given by:\n.\n.I N\nH l\n2\nm\nm mag\n1\n=  (15)\n3. Nanocrystaline Alloys Development\nThe first nanocomposite soft magnetic alloy based on the \nFe-Cu-M(-Si)-B alloy (M: Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Zr, etc.) was obtained by \nYoshizawa et al.4. The first step was to produce amorphous metal \nribbons of about 20 µm thickness. Next, the amorphous ribbons were \nwound into toroidal cores, and then the core materials were annealed \nto produce the nanocrystalline soft magnetic material with an average \ngrain size of approximately 10 nm5. \nAfter Yoshizawa et al. report 4, nanocrystalline materials have \nbeen investigated for applications in magnetic devices requiring \nOD\nHT\nID\nOD = Outer diameter ID = Inner diameter HT = Height\nFigure 3. Toroidal core geometry.\n398 Luciano et al. Materials Research\nboth magnetically hard and soft materials. In particular, amorphous \nand nanocrystalline alloys have been used as the core material in \nsome electromagnetic devices, such as distribution transformers, \ncommon mode choke coils, pulse transformers, impulse current \ntransformers, transformers for switched-mode power supplies and \ncurrent transformers6.\n4. Magnetic Characterization\nIn Figures 4, 5 and 6 are presented the hysteresis curve at 60 Hz, \nthe permeability curve at 60 Hz and the initial magnetization curve \nat 5 Hz, obtained for the nanocrystalline alloy FINEMET ® FT-3M \nF6045G produced by Hitachi Metals Ltd.\nFrom the magnetic characterization, it has been verified that, to \nthe typical CT operation value of 0.2 T, the nanocrystalline properties \nreinforce the hypothesis that the use of these materials in measurement \nCT cores can reduce both the relation and phase errors and can also \nimprove its accuracy class.\n5. Numerical Calculation Using FEMM Package\nWhilst analytical method is useful for must problems concern -\ning transformers design, the numerical methods provide a better \nunderstanding of transformers electromagnetic behavior. Indeed, \nnumerical methods, such as the finite element method, allow an ac-\ncurate determination of flux densities in the whole domain and also \nthe study of local phenomena. In this work, a finite element method \ncomputer program was carried out in order to obtain the flux density \ninside the magnetic material in the toroidal core CT previously de -\nsigned. These simulations were performed using the electromagnetic \npackage FEMM 3.3 applied for low frequencies7.\nIn the simulations, a quarter of the toroidal core was chosen as the \ndomain of study, as this part of the entire geometry presents symmetry \nalong the horizontal and vertical axies. This proceeding helps to re-\nduce the processing time needed. The program FEMM 3.3 was used to \nsimulate the behaviour of a CT whose electrical and magnetic circuits \nwere previously designed by analytical proceedings. Four simulations \nwere realized, which aimed to compare the CT performance when its \ncore was composed of four different magnetic materials. \nThe magnetic materials chosen to be compared as the CT core \nmaterial were: the nanocrystalline alloy FINEMET® FT-3M F6045G, \nproduced by the Japanese company Hitachi Metals Ltd.; the amor -\nphous alloy METGLAS® 2605S-2, produced by the American compa-\nny Honeywell International; the nanocrystalline alloy NANOPERM® \nM-033-03 N1, produced by the German company Magnetec GmbH; \nand grain oriented (GO) silicon-iron E-004, produced by the Brasil-\nian company Acesita.\nIn Table 1 there are some magnetic characteristics of the magnetic \nmaterials studied in the simulations. Silicon steel is an example of \nmagnetic material commonly used in the cores of commercial CT. \nThus, the simulations could compare the performance between fer -\nrocrystalline conventional materials and new magnetic materials as \nCT cores. In this table, Bs is the saturation flux density, µrmax is the \nmaximum value of the relative permeability, and ρ is the resistivity \nof the material.\nA CT is used in such a way that the magnitude of secondary cur-\nrent has negligible influence on magnitude of the primary current. \nThus, as the primary winding gives the necessary energy to the core \nmagnetization, it was the only one winding designed in simulations. \nIts eight turns were uniformly distributed along the core and just two \nof then appear in the quarter designed. The conductor used in the \nprimary winding is made of copper and, according to the previous \ncalculations, has the diameter of the wire 5 AWG.

The domain of study divided in the finite elements \nof the mesh is shown in Figure 7.\nTo analyse the performance of the CT, the dimensions and the \nconstitutive parts of the problem were always kept the same in \nevery simulation, just changing the characteristics of the magnetic \nV ol. 8, No 4, 2005 Nanocrystalline Material in Toroidal Cores for Current Transformer: Analytical Study and Computational Simulations 399\nmaterial that would occupy the place in the domain reserved to the \ncore. From the resuts given by the program, some informations \nwere collected for each one of the magnetic materials studied. \nThese data were: the magnetic field intensity ( H) in the place of \nthe core where the magnetic induction reached the desired value \nof 0.2 T; the relative magnetic permeability ( µR) at this point; and \nthe excitation current ( Io) necessary to obtain that operation induc -\ntion value. In Table 2 can be seen these values obtained for every \nmagnetic material studied.\nIn Figure 8 is shown one of the graphics provided by FEMM 3.3 \nfor the simulation using the nanocrystalline alloy FINEMET® FT-3M \nF6045G. The magnetic flux lines stay confined within the magnetic \nmaterial of the core, due to its high relative permeability value in \ncomparison with the others elements of the domain. The intensity of \nthe magnetic flux can be observed by the colour scale in the figure, \nwhere the more intense is the red tinge, the greater is the flux density \nin the material.\nThe calculations show that the field and flux density vary ra -\ndially in a wound toroid. In each simulation, the copper turns of \nthe primary winding conducted the calculated value of exciting \ncurrent necessary to induce inside each magnetic material a mean \nflux density of 0.2 T. To reach this particular value of magnetic \ninduction in the core, the nanocrystalline alloy FINEMET ® FT-3M \nF6045G was the magnetic material that demanded the lowest value \nof exciting current, followed by the amorphous alloy METGLAS ® \n2605S-2. Their values of exciting currents are extremely lower than \nthe one demanded by the GO silicon-iron E-004, which does not \npresent a high magnetic permeability at the CT operation induc -\ntion value. Finally, the other nanocrystalline alloy, NANOPERM ® \nM-033-03 N1, although presenting very low rates of magnetic losses \nat 60 Hz, also needed a relatively high value of exciting current. \nThis alloy congregates good magnetic properties in general, but \nparticularly at 0.2 T your relative magnetic permeability is very \nlower than that presented by the nanocrystalline alloy FINEMET ® \nFT-3M F6045G.\n6. Conclusions\nFrom the magnetic characterization and the computational \nsimulations, using the finite element method (FEM), it has been \nverified that, at the typical current transformers operation value of \n0.2 T, the nanocrystalline alloys properties reinforce the hypothesis \nthat the use of these materials in measurement current transformer \ncores can reduce the relation and phase errors and can also improve \nits accuracy class.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to Hitachi Metals Ltd. and Magnetec \nGmbH for providing the nanocrystalline alloys in toroidal cores shape, \nand to ACESITA and TOROID for the important informations con-\nceded.
