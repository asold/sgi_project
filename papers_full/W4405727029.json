  "abstract": "We introduce Dynamic Dropout, a novel regularization technique designed to enhance the training efficiency of Transformer models by dynamically adjusting the dropout rate based on training epochs or validation loss improvements. This approach addresses the challenge of balancing regularization and model capacity, which is crucial for achieving fast convergence and high performance. Our method involves modifying the GPT model to accept a variable dropout rate and updating dropout layers during training using schedules such as linear decay, exponential decay, and validation loss-based adjustments. Extensive experiments on the Shakespeare char dataset demonstrate that Dynamic Dropout significantly accelerates training and improves inference efficiency compared to a baseline model with a fixed dropout rate. The validation loss-based adjustment schedule provided the best overall performance, highlighting the potential of Dynamic Dropout as a valuable technique for training large-scale Transformer models.",
