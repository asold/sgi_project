Overall process of artificial neural network. \n2 Methodology \nSteel AISI 5140 is an important material widely used in any industry, plays a key role in the \nproduction of various components. The influence of cutting tool wear on the processing of \nAISI 5140 is significant and affects not only the quality of the finished product, but also \nproduction costs. Accurate prediction of tool wear conditions becomes the most important \naspect to ensure the desired surface quality of parts and timely replacement of cutting tools. \nThere is a clear need to develop an effective tool condition monitoring (TCM) system aimed \nat increasing productivity and automating the metalworking process, especially on automated \nmachines. Although numerous attempts have been made in the past to develop TCM systems \nusing data from multiple sensors such as dynamometers, accelerometers, acoustic emissions, \nand electrical measurements, success has been limited by the complex nature of tool wear \nmechanisms. In contrast, alternative techniques that include parameters such as cutting speed \nand depth of cut offer promise for effective tool condition monitoring. The importance of \npredicting tool wear based on these parameters is emphasized by its impact on ensuring the \nrequired surface quality of parts and timely replacement of tools [7-10]. \nObservation from the literature  shows a noticeable gap in the field of tool condition \nmonitoring in high-speed machining of steel AI SI 5140, especially with a primary focus on \nsingle-edge tools. Previous studies using SVM method for condition monitoring of CNC gear \ngrinding machine further highlight the need for comprehensive research in this field [11-13]. \nThis study takes a special approach of continuously monitoring tool wear on a high-speed \nmachining machine using parameters such as cutting speed and depth of cut instead of \ntraditional vibration signals. Using machine l earning algorithms, sp ecifically the decision \ntree algorithm, the study aims to correlate tool states. Extensive experiments were carried out \nusing coated multi-hole carbide tools under different machining conditions, with special \n2\n E3S Web of Conferences 471, 02021 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202447102021\nTITDS-XIV-2023\nattention paid to fixed machining paramete rs. Using advanced data mining techniques, \nstatistical features were extracted for use in  the decision tree algorithm. Machine learning \nalgorithms including artificial neural networks and decision tree algorithm were used to \nfurther classify the tool wear condition and their classification performance was carefully \ncompared. Determining the most effective f eature classifier concludes this study, \ncontributing to the ongoing debate on optimizing tool condition monitoring strategies in high-\nspeed machining scenarios. The graphical representation of the study and methodology is \nrepresented in Figure 2. \n \nFig. 2. Steps required obtaining a result. \nIn this study, the dataset utilized for tool condition monitoring encompasses a diverse set \nof machining parameters crucial for understanding the dynamics of tool wear during high-\nspeed machining of AISI 5140 steel. The data is sourced from controlled experiments \nconducted on a high-speed milling machine, focusing on the machining of AISI 5140 using \nmulti-hole coated carbide tools. The primary parameters included in the dataset are depth of \ncut, continuous vibration monito ring (accelerometer data), spi ndle speed, feed rate, cutting \nspeed.

Data processing techniques are applied to extract statistical characteristics from \nthe continuously monitored parameters. This step is crucial for transforming raw sensor data \ninto meaningful features that capture the essence of tool wear conditions during machining. \nAdditionally, the Decision Tree algorithm is empl oyed as part of the preprocessing steps to \nextract dominant features from the dataset.  This algorithm aids in identifying the most \nrelevant variables that contribute significantly to the prediction of tool wear conditions. \nThis curated and preprocessed dataset serv es as the foundation for the subsequent \napplication of machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and decision \ntree algorithms, to predict and classify tool wear conditions during high-speed machining of \nAISI 5140 steel. The careful selection and preprocessing of the dataset are vital elements in \nensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of the tool condition monitoring system developed \nin this study. \n3\nE3S Web of Conferences 471, 02021 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202447102021\nTITDS-XIV-2023\n3 Results and discussion \n3.1 Model architecture \nThe Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectur e employed in this study is designed to \neffectively capture hierarchical  features from both vibration signals and above mentioned \nparameters of machining conditions for the prediction of cutting tool wear in high-speed \nmachining of steel AISI 5140. The model begins with a series of artificial layers responsible \nfor feature extraction from the input statistical dataset. Each layer is followed by a Rectified \nLinear Unit (ReLU) activation function to introduce non-linearity and enhance the network's \nability to capture complex patterns. Additionally , max-pooling layers are incorporated as a \nnormalization means and to reduce the computational complexity. \nSimultaneously, continuous vibration signals are processed through a separate branch of \nthe network. These signals undergo initial preprocessing, including noise removal and \nsegmentation, and are subsequently fed through artificial layers followed by ReLU activation \nfunctions to extract relevant temporal features. Max-pooling layers are also employed in this \nbranch to down-sample the temporal dimensions. To merge the information extracted from \nboth branches, a concatenation layer is introduc ed, facilitating the fusion of spatial features \nfrom images and temporal features from vibration signals. Following the concatenation, fully \nconnected layers are utilized to combine the extracted features and generate a comprehensive \nrepresentation of the input data for the final prediction. \nTo optimize model performance and prevent overfitting, excluded layers are strategically \ninserted after fully connected layers, randomly excluding a portion of neurons during training \nto improve generalization. Batch normalization is used to stabilize and accelerate the learning \nprocess by normalizing the input data of each layer. The model is trained using a data set that \nincludes a diverse range of processing conditions and corresponding tool wear \nmeasurements. The learning process involves minimizing a suitable loss function by back \npropagation of the error and adjusting the para meters of the model to improve the accuracy \nof its prediction. To evaluate the effectivene ss of the model, extensive checks and tests are \ncarried out on independent data sets, evaluating its ability to generalize invisible processing \nscenarios. The results demonstrate the ability of the proposed ANN architecture to accurately \npredict the wear of the cutting tool during high-speed processing of AISI 5140 steel, \ndemonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for monitoring the condition of the tool in real \ntime and optimizing maintenance in industrial conditions. \n3.2 Training procedure \nNeural network consists of interconnected layers covering the input, hidden and output levels. \nInside these layers, artificial neurons are equipped with activation functions. These neurons \nreceive input data using a we ighted sum approach  when faced with multiple inputs, and \neventually generate output data based on their activation functions. The learning process \ninvolves adjusting the weights by comparing the output of the network with the desired output \ndata using the functions selected by the J48 algorithm, namely standard error, kurtosis and \nmedian. The neural network ar chitecture adopted in this study embodies a backward error \npropagation model with direct communication. In particular, it includes a model with one \nhidden layer containing 10 neurons, each of which is characterized by activation functions of \nthe sigmoid colon. The training uses 70% of the available data (61 data points), and the \nremaining 30% is allocated for testing (13 data points) and cross-validation (13 data points). \nThe selection of data points for these phases is carried out randomly. The output layer of the \nneural network serves as a representation of the states of the instrument, classifying them into \n\"good condition\", \"average servi ce life\" and \"critical\". After training, the network is tested \n4\n E3S Web of Conferences 471, 02021 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202447102021\nTITDS-XIV-2023\nusing additional data to assess the adequacy of training. Subsequently, test data is entered \ninto the network to classify the condition of the instrument. The architectural configuration \nof the neural network is visually presented in Figure 3.  \n \n \nFig. 3. Input parameters and output results. \nWhen extending the assessment to a set of test data, only one classification error was \ndetected, which gave a classification efficiency of 92.3%. Such high performance at the \nverification stage confirms the ability of the network to generalize new and previously \nunknown data. Subsequently, when applied to a set of test data, the model demonstrated a \nclassification efficiency of 92.3% with small deviations. This result highlights the reliability \nand consistency of the model in making accurate predictions for different data sets. \nConsidering the combined performance of data  sets for training, validation and testing, \nthe overall classification efficiency is an impressive 95.4%. This high level of accuracy and \nconsistency once again confirms the effectiveness of the developed neural network model in \nthe effective recognition and classification of tool states. \nMoreover, the reliability of the neural network model is further emphasized by its ability \nto maintain high classification efficiency in va rious data sets, which reflects its adaptability \nto changes in processing conditions. The excellent characteristics of the model not only \nconfirm its reliability for predicting tool wear  during high-speed processing of AISI 5140 \nsteel, but also suggest its potential applicability to similar production processes with different \nmaterials and parameters. As industries continue to explore the benefits of advanced \npreventive maintenance strategies, the demonstr ated success of this neural network model \npromises to increase efficiency, reduce downtime, and ultimately optimize tool life across a \nwide range of processing operations. \n \n5\nE3S Web of Conferences 471, 02021 (2024) https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202447102021\nTITDS-XIV-2023\n \nFig. 4.
