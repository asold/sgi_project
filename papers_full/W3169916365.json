  "abstract": "This article presents a novel planar-based transformer winding and core structure with controllable leakage inductance generation for integrated magnetics applications. As a result of limitations in integrated magnetics from the literature, a new approach is proposed utilizing semi-interleaved windings and controllable leakage via a leakage flux core leg featuring a horizontal air gap. Here, the proposed transformer design is analyzed via detailed reluctance modeling to determine closed-form equations for the magnetizing and asymmetrically distributed leakage inductances. Next, a genetic-algorithm-based multiobjective design optimization problem is developed, seeking to minimize the core and winding losses of the proposed transformer subject to a set of parametric and geometric constraints in a dc-ac dual-active-bridge topology for microinverter applications. The optimization was extended to include other integrated magnetic structures from the literature, where it is determined that the proposed transformer is superior from the perspectives of efficiency, footprint area, and parasitic capacitance. Based on the results of the optimization analysis, two designs with theoretical transformer California Energy Commission (CEC) efficiency drops (i.e., CEC efficiency reduction specifically due to the transformer loss mechanisms) of 1.19% and 0.83% were fabricated and evaluated for electrical and thermal performance in the proposed 40 V, 400 W microinverter.",
