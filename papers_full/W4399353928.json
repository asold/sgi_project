For instance, a user who asks “Do they\nhave parking? ” is both inquiring and providing a preference for avail-\nable parking. Similarly, a user looking for a restaurant who states\n“I’m watching my weight ” is expressing a complex preference that\nrequires commonsense reasoning and may not match any prede-\nfined restaurant metadata fields. Metadata is also often incomplete\nor out-of-date, making it challenging to connect NL requests to\nrelevant item recommendations. This creates major limitations for\ntraditional NL ConvRec systems that rely on mapping user intents\nand preferences to predefined metadata taxonomies [13, 19, 23, 26].\nFortunately, many recommendation domains have an abundance\nof rich NL item reviews that not only refer to standard metadata\ncategories but also offer more complex opinions and narratives that\nmight match a user’s interests, e.g. “The menu had lots of low-cal\nveggie options!”. However, what we have lacked until recently with\nthe advent of large language models (LLMs) [5, 6, 20] is the ability to\nunlock the commonsense reasoning connections between rich user\npreference utterances and expressive language in user-generated\ncontent such as NL reviews. In addition to bridging this language ex-\npression and reasoning gap, LLMs also provide novel opportunities\nto control and facilitate a range of interactions in ConvRec dialogue,\nsuch as understanding user intents and preferences,and generating\nrecommendations, explanations, and answers to questions [8].\nWe thus introduce a novel open source demonstration technol-\nogy RA-Rec, a Retrieval-Augmented, LLM-driven dialogue state\ntracking system for ConvRec, making the following contributions:\n•We introduce prompt-driven ConvRec intent classification\nand state updating that captures nuanced NL expressions\nwhile maintaining domain-specific preference structure via\na semi-structured NL dialogue state (Sec. 3.2).\n•We extend recent work onreviewed-item retrieval [1] to Conv-\nRec dialogue, generating state-based queries, recommenda-\ntions, explanations, and question answers (Figure 2).\n•We demonstrate RA-Rec for restaurant recommendation, in-\ncluding a video,1 a well-documented open source GitHub\nrepository under a permissive MIT License,2 and an interac-\ntive Google Colab notebook that can run the system.3\n1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Y56UW2LTU\n2https://github.com/D3Mlab/llm-convrec\n3https://apoj.short.gy/d3m-llm-convrec-demo\narXiv:2406.00033v1  [cs.CL]  25 May 2024\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Sara Kemper et al.\nFigure 1: The RA-Rec prompt-driven dialogue state tracking loop.

How can I help you?”\n2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\n2.1 Dialogue State Tracking\nA standard Dialogue State Tracking (DST) loop [24] has four steps:\n(1) intent understanding, (2) dialogue state updating, (3) action\nselection, and (4) response generation. A traditional state consists\nof keys and values, typically from a predefined set of labels such\nas “food: italian”, “price: cheap”, “area: east” , that represent a most\nlikely estimate of the participants’ shared intentions and beliefs at a\ngiven turn [7, 24]. State tracking techniques generally map features\nextracted from user utterances to state labels, and include hand-\ncrafted rules [ 3, 15], discriminative classifiers [ 4] and Bayesian\nnetworks [21, 25]. While following the DST loop steps for modular\ndialogue control, our RA-Rec system (Sec. 3) extends traditional\nDST methods with LLM-driven state tracking to capture complex,\nNL expressions of preference and to facilitate state-based retrieval-\naugmented recommendation and question answering (QA).\n2.2 Reviewed Item Retrieval\nAiming to unlock the expressive NL data available in reviews, Abdol-\nlah Pour et al. [1] recently extended Neural IR [22] to an approach\nthey call Reviewed Item Retrieval (RIR), where the key challenge lies\nin fusing low-level information from multiple reviews to a higher\nitem level [28]. They demonstrate it is more effective to first score\nindividual reviews against a query and then aggregate these scores\nto an item level ( late fusion ), instead of summarizing reviews at\nan item level before query-scoring (early fusion ), since late fusion\nretains critical nuanced review information lost by early fusion.\nIn late fusion RIR, given a query and a set of reviews, a neural en-\ncoder maps each review and the query to respective embeddings. A\nsimilarity function, such as the dot product, then computes a query-\nreview similarity score. For each item, scores from the reviews with\nthe highest query-review similarities are then averaged (fused) to\ngive a query-item similarity score, and the top-scoring items are\nreturned. As we will discuss in the next section, our RA-Rec sys-\ntem adapts late fusion RIR to ConvRec by generating queries from\na NL dialogue state and using review-based retrieval-augmented\ngeneration for recommendation and QA, as illustrated in Figure 2.\n3 RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED\nCONVERSATIONAL RECOMMENDATION\nTo leverage both the modular structure of a traditional DST loop and\nthe NL reasoning abilities of LLMs, we propose RA-Rec, a modular,\nretrieval-augmented ConvRec system, illustrated in Figure 1. We\nRetrieval-Augmented ConvRec with Semi-Structured NL State Tracking SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nFigure 2: Retrieval-augmented recommendation and explanation using late fusion RIR. First, preferences in the dialogue state\nare used to generate a NL query. Then, query and review embeddings are scored using dot product similarity, and the top review\nscores for each item are averaged (fused) into an item score. Finally, the top items’ most relevant reviews and metadata are used\nto generate a recommendation and explanation of how the item satisfies the preferences in the state.\nTable 2: JSON keys in the RA-Rec semi-structured NL dialogue state. Subkeys can be modified to easily facilate new domains.\nBold subkeys indicate mandatory preferences the system will request information about if these preferences are not provided.\nState Key Description Subkeys\nhard_constraints User preferences that must be satisfied location, cuisine_type, dish_type, price_range, atmosphere,\ndietary_restrictions, wait_times, type_of_meal, otherssoft_constraints User preferences that are not required\nrecommended_items Previously recommended items -\nrejected_items Previously rejected items -\naccepted_items Previously accepted items -\nemploy a prompt-driven approach for intent classification and state\nupdating, with the latter relying on a JSON format NL state that can\nbe configured with domain-specific keys while capturing nuance\nthrough LLM-generated NL values. We then use this NL state to\nfacilitate personalized, retrieval-augmented recommendation and\nQA utilizing item reviews and metadata.\n3.1 Prompt-Driven Intent Classification\nAfter the user makes an utterance, LLM-prompting is used to deter-\nmine whether the user expresses any of the four intents in Table 1,\nwhich are a subset of the recommendation dialogue intent taxon-\nomy of Lyu et al. [18]. Table 3 outlines the prompts used in RA-Rec,\nwith full prompt templates available in the GitHub repository (see\nSec. 1). We take a multi-label intent classification approach to cap-\nture multiple intents that might be expressed in a single utterance\n— for example, the utterance “Does Washoku Bistro have parking?”\nshould be classified using both the intents “Inquire” and “Provide\npreference” because it expresses a preference towards available park-\ning. A larger set of user intents can be facilitated by updating the\nsystem’s prompts and initial state keys.\n3.2 Semi-Structured NL Dialogue State Tracking\nWe store descriptions of user preferences and other important con-\nversational elements such as rejected recommendations in a JSON\nstate using the keys shown in Table 2 — two state examples are in\nFigures 1 and 2. While the keys provide structure, the state values\nare typically LLM-generated from the latest utterances, allowing\nthe state to represent complex NL expressions of preference such\nas “I’m watching my weight” at a level of nuance and expressivity\nthat would be impossible with predefined value sets. We thus refer\nto this state representation as a semi-structured NL dialogue state.\n3.2.1 State Elements. Since the goal of RA-Rec is recommendation,\nthe most important components of the state maintain an up-to-date\nbelief about user preferences, represented through hard (required)\nand soft (not required) constraints. In our restaurant recommenda-\ntion demo, these constraints are represented with several domain-\nspecific subkeys listed in Table 2, as well as an “others” subkey to\ncapture any unspecified preference types. To adaptRA-Rec to a new\ndomain, these restaurant-specific subkeys can be replaced with\ndomain-specific subkeys with little effort from a system designer.\nOther state elements include previously recommended, rejected,\nor accepted restaurants – more elements could be easily added\nto handle a wider set of (domain-specific) user intents and sys-\ntem actions. Most state values are LLM-generated (prompts are\nsummarized in Table 3) and used downstream for action selection,\nrecommendation, explanation, and QA, discussed next.\n3.3 Action Selection\nThe main system actions, summarized in Table 1 are Request Infor-\nmation, Recommend and Explain , and Answer. To understand our\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Sara Kemper et al.\nTable 3: The main prompts used in RA-Rec – full templates can be found in the repository documentation (see Sec. 1 link).\nComponent Prompt Description\nIntent Classification Classify Intent Given a user utterance and description of an intent (e.g. inquire), identify whether the utterance expresses the intent.\nState Update Update Constraints Given a user utterance and the previous hard and soft constraints, update the constraints.\nUpdate Accepted/Rejected\nItem\nGiven a user utterance with intent \"Accept/Reject Recommendation\", identify which item was accepted/rejected.\nRecommendation\nand Explanation\nGenerate Recommendation\nQuery\nGiven hard/soft constraints in the state, generate a NL query.\nExplain Recommendations Given the top retrieved items, their metadata, and their top reviews, explain how these recommended items match\nthe hard/soft constraints.\nQA\nDetermine QA Knowledge\nSource\nGiven a user inquiry about recommended items and those items’ metadata, identify which fields should be used to\nanswer the inquiry, if any. If none, reviews will be used as the QA knowledge source.\nAnswer Using Metadata Given an inquiry and relevant metadata entries, generate an answer.\nGenerate QA Query Given a user inquiry utterance, generate a NL query.\nAnswer Using Reviews Given an inquiry and retrieved reviews, generate an answer.\nRequest Information implementation, consider a user asking for a\nrestaurant recommendation without giving a location preference\n— a recommendation may yield a restaurant in the wrong city! To\navoid such premature recommendations with insufficient context,\nwe identify mandatory preferences that the system must ask before\nrecommending if not already provided by the user. In our demo,\nmandatory preferences are location and cuisine_type as shown in\nTable 2, but this selection is easily customized. Once mandatory\npreferences have been provided, the system will Answer if the user\nhas made an inquiry and Recommend and Explain otherwise.\n3.4 Retrieval-Augmented Recommendation and\nExplanation\nTo leverage expressive user review content inRA-Rec, we provide\na novel adaptation of retrieval-augmented generation [16] for late\nfusion recommendation and explanation. To do this, we first gener-\nate a query based on semi-structured preferences in the dialogue\nstate and then retrieve relevant items using RIR (Sec. 2.2) over both\nthe item reviews and known metadata. This process is illustrated\nin Figure 2 with relevant prompts summarized in Table 3.\nSpecifically, after a NL query is generated from the hard and soft\nconstraints in the state, we implement late fusion RIR to retrieve a\nlist of top-𝑘 scoring items. Our implementation of late fusion RIR\nuses a TAS-B dense encoder [11] (a variant of BERT [9] fine-tuned\nfor retrieval), dot product similarity, and approximate maximum-\ninner product search (MIPS) via FAISS [10] to enable scalability to\nlarge review corpora. After the top-𝑘 items (𝑘 = 2 in our demo) are\nretrieved, we use the metadata and top-scoring reviews for each\nitem in a prompt to generate a recommendation and explanation\nof how these items match the dialogue state preferences.\n3.5 Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering\nAs observed by Lyu et al. [18], the later stages of a recommendation\nconversational often involve a number of inquiries about the rec-\nommended item to confirm that it meets the user’s requirements.\nTo address such QA, RA-Rec retrieves relevant reviews or metadata\nfor each of the items in question and uses this retrieved informa-\ntion to generate an answer – with Table 3 outlining the prompts\nused in our QA approach. Our framework is capable of addressing\nboth individual item questions such as “What kind of menu do they\noffer?” as well as comparative questions such as “How do their prices\ncompare?” as demonstrated in the video (see Sec. 1).\nIn more detail, the first step of QA uses prompting to determine\nwhether an inquiry can be answered using available metadata,\nwhich is typically the best knowledge source for simple questions\nabout common properties. In our restaurant recommendation demo,\nsuch common metadata fields include price, delivery availability,\nand parking information. If the inquiry cannot be answered with\nmetadata, a NL query is generated from the user utterance and used\nto retrieve several reviews for each item in question. As discussed\nabove, reviews are an expressive knowledge source, especially when\ninquiries and preferences are stated in complex ways. Finally, the\nretrieved reviews and metadata for each item are used to generate\nan answer to the question, which may include item comparisons.\n3.6 RA-Rec System Summary\nIn summary, RA-Rec employs an LLM-driven, modular DST struc-\nture to facilitate a controllable recommendation dialogue that can\nconnect complex NL user preferences to matching items using\ntheir reviews and metadata. Its JSON semi-structured NL state\nfeatures configurable keys for domain-specific control while the\nLLM-updated state values are able to express NL nuance. This state\nsupports novel retrieval-augmented recommendation, explanation,\nand QA, using scalable retrieval methods such as late fusion RIR\nand leveraging item reviews and metadata to generate responses.\n4 DEMONSTRATION DETAILS\nOur system is designed for easy adaptation to various domains,\nand as a demonstration, we present RA-Rec for restaurant recom-\nmendation — see Sec. 1 for demo links. Specifically, we use the\nYelp Academic Dataset4 to obtain metadata and over 46K reviews\nfor 1298 restaurants in Edmonton, Alberta.5 GPT-3.5-turbo is the\nLLM used for all prompting steps, but the RA-Rec framework is\nLLM-agnostic and will work with any prompt-based LLM model.\n5 FUTURE WORK\nRA-Rec is a flexible LLM prompt-driven architecture and thus opens\nmany new directions for ConvRec systems to support natural\nuser workflows [13, 18]. Key extensions include support for (1) ac-\ntive preference elicitation to narrow down large item spaces [ 2],\n(2) structured reasoning over multi-aspect NL preferences [27], and\n(3) trade-off negotiation between multiple recommendations.\n4https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download\n5The median number of reviews per restaurant was 21.\nRetrieval-Augmented ConvRec with Semi-Structured NL State Tracking SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nREFERENCES\n[1] Mohammad Mahdi Abdollah Pour, Parsa Farinneya, Armin Toroghi, Anton Ko-\nrikov, Ali Pesaranghader, Touqir Sajed, Manasa Bharadwaj, Borislav Mavrin, and\nScott Sanner. 2023.
