  "full_text": "The use of tools by wrasses (Labridae)\nRecently, Jones et al. (2011) described the use of a rock as an anvil to crush\na bivalve by a wrasse, the blackspot tuskﬁsh, Choerodon schoenleinii.\nThey concluded by underscoring the importance of comparative studies on\ntool use in ﬁshes. Two similar occasions of tool use were previously\ndescribed for other wrasses (Labridae). In Florida, Coyer (1995) observed a\nyellowhead wrasse, Halichoeres garnoti. Pasko (2010) observed a sixbar\nwrasse, Thalassoma hardwicke, in an aquarium setting. Here, we describe a\nfourth instance by yet another wrasse, the orange-dotted tuskﬁsh,\nChoerodon anchorago (Fig. 1).\nOn July 12, 2009, at 10:30 h in Palau, in 4 feet of water, an individual\nC. anchorago was observed cracking bivalves using a rock as an anvil.\nAfter two such events, we started ﬁlming the behavior, which was\nrepeated a third time (see Electronic Supplementary Material). Each event\nlasted less than 5 min, for a total observation time of approximately\n20 min. The ﬁsh ﬁrst dug out the bivalve by fanning sand with its pectoral\nﬁn and then took the mollusk to a rock, or coral head, where it was\ncrushed in a similar way to what has been described for C. schoenleinii.\nThe use of rock as an anvil has now been described from different places\nin three genera of wrasses, the ancestralChoerodon, and the more derived\nHalichoeres and Thalassoma, which span the majority of the evolutionary\nhistory of wrasses (50 million years, Cowman et al.2009). All observations\nwere similar in both the use of a rock as an anvil to open or reduce the size of\na bivalve to making it edible and the sideways movement of the head\nassociated with it. The similarity of the behaviors suggests that either they\nemerged independently or they correspond to a deep-seated behavioral\ntrait. If this were the case, we predict that other wrasses are likely to also use\nthese forms of tools. The presence or absence of such a behavior in other\ngroups of ﬁshes will determine whether the use of a rock as an anvil is\nunique to wrasses or whether it can be generalized to other groups of ﬁshes.\nReferences\nCowman PF, Bellwood DR, van Herwerden L (2009) Dating the evolutionary origins\nof wrasse lineages (Labridae) and the rise of trophic novelty on coral reefs.
