  "full_text": "RESEARCH Open Access\nThe use of e-health and m-health tools in\nhealth promotion and primary prevention\namong older adults: a systematic literature\nreview\nRamon Kampmeijer 1, Milena Pavlova 1*, Marzena Tambor 2, Stanis ława Golinowska 2 and Wim Groot 1,3\nAbstract\nBackground: The use of e-health and m-health technologies in health promotion and primary prevention among\nolder people is largely unexplored. This study provides a systematic review of the evidence on the scope of the use\nof e-health and m-health tools in health promotion and primary prevention among older adults (age 50+).\nMethods: A systematic literature review was conducted in October 2015. The search for relevant publications was\ndone in the search engine PubMed. The key inclusion criteria were: e-health and m-health tools used, participants ’\nage 50+ years, focus on health promotion and primary prevention, published in the past 10 years, in English, and\nfull-paper can be obtained. The text of the publications was analyzed based on two themes: the characteristics of\ne-health and m-health tools and the determinants of the use of these tools by older adults. The quality of the\nstudies reviewed was also assessed.\nResults: The initial search resulted in 656 publications. After we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 45\npublications were selected for the review. In the publications reviewed, various types of e-health/m-health tools\nwere described, namely apps, websites, devices, video consults and webinars. Most of the publications (60 %)\nreported studies in the US. In 37 % of the publications, the study population was older adults in general, while the\nrest of the publications studied a specific group of older adults (e.g. women or those with overweight). The\npublications indicated various facilitators and barriers. The most commonly mentioned facilitator was the support\nfor the use of the e-health/m-health tools that the older adults received.\nConclusions: E-health and m-health tools are used by older adults in diverse health promotion programs, but also\noutside formal programs to monitor and improve their health. The latter is hardly studied. The successful use of\ne-health/m-health tools in health promotion programs for older adults greatly depends on the older adults ’\nmotivation and support that older adults receive when using e-health and m-health tools.\nKeywords: Older adults, e-health, m-health, Telemedicine, Health promotion, Prevention\n* Correspondence: m.pavlova@maastrichtuniversity.nl\n1Department of Health Services Research, CAPHRI, Maastricht University\nMedical Center, Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, Maastricht\nUniversity, PO Box 6166200, MD, Maastricht, The Netherlands\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2016 The Author(s).

E-health and m-health can be\nany kind of electronic device or monitoring system that\nis applied by physicians in the healthcare practice or by\nindividuals to monitor or improve their health status.\nE-health typically refers to on-line and off-line computer-\nbased applications while m-health refers to applications\nfor mobile phones [1, 2]. Such tools can be used to\nstimulate a positive health behavior change or assist per-\nsons to lead a healthier life style, or to support diagnosis\nand treatment of diseases.\nE-health and m-health technologies are mostly used by\nyounger people. The potential of this technology for older\nadults is generally recognized although the application of\ne-health and m-health tools in health promotion and\nprimary prevention for older persons has been largely\nunexplored [2].\nPositive changes in health-related lifestyle among older\nadults offer the opportunity for health benefits. It is rec-\nognized that promoting health among this population\ngroup may contribute to more healthy life years and in-\ncreased life expectancy [3]. Many diseases among older\nadults are partly or fully preventable if individuals en-\ngage in a healthy lifestyle [4]. For example, physical\nactivity and a proper diet can help to prevent obesity,\nheart diseases, hypertension, diabetes and even premature\nmortality [5, 6]. Although the importance of a healthy life-\nstyle is known, older adults (50+ years) are frequently\nphysically inactive [3, 7]. The use of e-health and m-health\ntechnologies could help older adults to improve or main-\ntain their health. But to what extent is the use of such\ntools by older adults reported in the literature?\nThis study aims to provide insight in the scope of the\nuse of e-health and m-health tools for health promotion\nand primary prevention among older adults using the\nmethod of a systematic review. Hitherto, no in-depth\noverview of this topic is provided in the literature.\nTherefore, our review is an initial step that explores the\nscope of the use of e-health and m-health tools in health\npromotion and primary prevention among older adults.\nWe include the use of such tools within health promotion\nprograms as well as the use of such tools by older adults\noutside formal programs with the goal to monitor and im-\nprove their health. In this way, our review may provide a\nbase for subsequent more specific reviews focused on a\ncertain type of e-health and m-health tools, and its use in\nhealth promotion programs, as well as reviews on the ef-\nfectiveness of e-health and m-health promotion programs\nwithin a specific group of older adults and specific setting.\nOur review focuses on two dimensions: the character-\nistics of e-health and m-health tools used for monitoring\nand improving the health of older adults and the deter-\nminants of the use of e-health and m-health tools by\nolder adults. The review identifies gaps in the research\narea that can be used for setting up new studies as men-\ntioned above.\nThe review is relevant for policy and society because\nof the ageing of the population and the increase in\nmulti-morbidity which consequently lead to greater de-\nmand for healthcare and higher healthcare expenditure.\nTherefore, it is important to know whether and how the\nemerging new technologies, specifically e-health and\nm-health tools, can be used by older adults to prevent\ndiseases and help older adults to have not only longer but\nalso a healthier life.\nMethods\nThis study uses a systematic literature review to analyze\nthe use of e-health and m-health tools for health promo-\ntion among older adults. The methodology of a system-\natic literature review outlined in Grant and Booth (2009)\nis applied [8]. The study starts with a systematic litera-\nture search based on predefined search terms and selec-\ntion criteria. Then, the articles selected for the review\nare appraised and their relevant findings are synthesized\nnarratively based on the objective of the review, with the\nsupport of descriptive tables. The applied review method\nallows for a comprehensive overview of the current\nknowledge in a specific research field. This distinguishes\nour systematic review from other review methods such\nas scoping review and meta-analysis.\nGiven the aim for this review, three components are\nused to build the search terms for the identification of\nstudies on the use of e-health and m-health tools in health\npromotion and primary prevention among older adults:\n(1) elderly or old or senior; (2) health promotion or pri-\nmary prevention; (3) telemedicine or e-health or m-health.\nDifferent forms of the above words as well as relevant\nsynonyms are taken into account. This results in the\nfollowing chain of keywords, which is used to search\nfor relevant literature in search engine PubMed:\n(“aged”[MeSH Terms] OR “aged”[All Fields] OR\n“elderly”[All Fields] OR “old”[All Fields] OR\n“senior”[All Fields] OR “seniors”[All Fields]) AND\n(“health promotion ”[MeSH Terms] OR “health\npromotion”[All Fields] OR “promotion”[All Fields] OR\n“primary prevention” [MeSH Terms] OR “primary\nprevention”[All Fields] OR “prevention”[All Fields])\nAND (“telemedicine”[MeSH Terms] OR\n“telemedicine”[All Fields] OR “tele-medicine”[All Fields]\nOR “telehealth”[All Fields] OR “tele-health”[All Fields]\nOR “mhealth”[All Fields] OR “m-health”[All Fields] OR\n“eh\nealth ”[All Fields] OR “e-health”[All Fields])\nIn the search, MeSH terms (bibliographic thesaurus)\nwere also included to ensure uniformity and consistency\nThe Author(s) BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 5):290 Page 468 of 479\nin the literature search. The search was done in October\n2015.\nVarious inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied.\nTo be included in the review, the publication should be\npublished in the last 10 years, should be in English, and\nthe full-paper can be obtained. There are no limitations\nwith regard to the institution, which provides the e-health\nor m-health tools, i.e. papers that present e-health\nand m-health tools provided by state, insurers, employers\nand others are considered as relevant. We include papers\nwhich present the application of e-health and m-health\ntools not only within health promotion programs but also\nthe use of such tools by older adults outside formal\nprograms with the goal to monitor and improve their\nhealth. The publications could present data collected\namong older adults or among healthcare providers who\nprovide services to older persons. Publications that discuss\nthe topic in general as well as opinion papers and edito-\nrials are excluded.\nAlso, publications are selected if the age of participants\n(study group) is 50 years or older and if the focus is on\nhealth promotion and primary prevention. Based on\nKenkel (2000), health promotion and primary prevention\nare defined in this review as activities that aim to reduce\nthe probability of illness by stimulating a healthy lifestyle\nand providing services that might decrease the future in-\ncident of illnesses [9]. Hence, publications that deal with\nthe use of telemedicine in home care to assist disable\npersons are excluded, as well as publications that report\non the use of electronic devices and computer-based sys-\ntems in secondary and tertiary prevention (e.g. monitor-\ning of chronic conditions in case of specific diseases).\nThe first screening of the publications that appear\nafter searching in PubMed with the chain of keywords\ngiven above, is based on the title and abstract of the\npublications. At this stage, publications are considered\npotentially relevant if their title and abstract have a link\nwith the review topic. For the second screening, the\npublications are downloaded and the text of the publica-\ntion is fully screened. Publications that fit the inclusion\ncriteria outlined above are classified as relevant and are\nselected for the review.\nAfter the screening, the method of directed (relational)\ncontent analysis of Hsieh and Shannon (2005), is used\nfor the analysis of the publications [10]. This type of\nanalysis requires the identification of categories (themes)\nrelevant to the review objective, extraction of informa-\ntion related to categories and synthesis of the informa-\ntion classified in each category. The groups of themes\nthat are used for the review and which form the units of\nanalysis, are:\n▪ Characteristics of the e-health and m-health tools:\ntypes of e-health tools (what tools and for what?);\napplication of e-health tools (what scheme/program/\ninitiatives?); target group or user group (who use\ne-health and m-health tools?); characteristics of the\nsetting (where and what location/country features?)\n▪ Determinants of the use of e-health and m-health\ntools/programs: facilitating factors for the use (what\nmotivates and enables the use?); barriers to the use\n(what prevents or discourages the use?)\nBased on these groups of themes, the data extraction\nis done. The results are presented per group of themes\nin a narrative manner and are complemented by descrip-\ntive tables. The quality of the publications (research de-\nsign and findings of the study reported) is assessed in a\nqualitative manner. We classify a study as reliable if the\nmethods of data collection and analysis are well defined\nin the publication, and are potentially repeatable. Simi-\nlarly, we classify a study as valid if the publication pro-\nvides clear indications of consistency of the results with\nstated study hypotheses, expectations and/or results of\nother similar studies. The generalizability of the study is\ndefined based on indications for possible extrapolation\nof the findings to the larger population. The quality of\nthis review is also checked using the Prisma 2009 check-\nlist (see Additional file 1).\nResults\nThe chain of keywords shown above yields 656 publica-\ntions, which are included in the initial screening. The re-\nsults of the screening are presented in Fig. 1. In the first\nscreening, 454 publications are excluded after reading\nthe abstract based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In\ntotal, 202 publications are included in the second\nscreening. For the second screening, the publications are\ndownloaded. The full-paper cannot be obtained for 35\npublications, and hence, these articles are excluded. The\ntext of the remaining 167 articles is reviewed. From\nthese 167 articles, 122 publications are excluded after\nreading the full text. The reasons of exclusion are: (1)\npublications are not about health promotion or primary\nprevention; (2) there is no e-health or m-health tool\nstudied; (3) older adults are not a study group; (4) a\ncombination of these above reasons. Thus, after the sec-\nond screening, 45 publications are selected for this sys-\ntematic review. A detailed description of the articles is\npresented in Additional file 2.\nGeneral description of the selected publications\nThe main characteristics of the included publications are\npresented in Table 1. The majority of the publications\nhave been published in the last 4 years. In the last 2 years\nonly, 33.3 % of the publications are published. The ma-\njority of the studies have an explanatory aim (quantita-\ntive studies investigating relations and determinants)\nThe Author(s) BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 5):290 Page 469 of 479\nand only nine publications are explorative or descriptive\n(qualitative or mix-methods studies providing more\ninsight on the topic).\nThere are four different research approaches in the\npublications reviewed. The majority (32 publications) are\nquantitative studies with primary data collection. Five\npublications use secondary data. In 28 publications,\nrandomization was reported. There are two systematic re-\nviews conducted, both are about telehealth. Seven methods\nof data collection are reported. Most publications use\nbiomedical test results as input data. These test results are\nmeasured by a healthcare professional or are provided by\nthe participant through a self-report. Five publications,\nincluding the two systematic reviews, use secondary data\nor patient records for data analysis. In one publication, ob-\nservation techniques are used for the data collection. Focus\ngroup discussions are reported in two publications. Seven\npublications report unstructured or semi-structured\ninterviews for data collection. The other publications use\nstandardized questionnaires or online questionnaires.\nIn Table 1, our qualitative assessment of reliability, valid-\nity and generalizability is also presented. If the publications\nare clear about their methods of data collection and ana-\nlysis, they are considered reliable. In total, 19 publications\nhave a clear and reliable description of the methods. In 16\npublications, some aspects of validity are mentioned.\nGeneralization is clearly outlined in 11 publications.\nCharacteristics of the use of e-health and m-health tools\namong older adults\nIn Table 2, the characteristics of the e-health and m-\nhealth tools used for health promotion and primary\nprevention among older adults are outlined. In the first\ncategory, the type of tool is mentioned. In 21 publica-\ntions, a website is reported for e-health services. One\nwebsite for instance, offers a help program to reduce\nweight, where participants can enter their data and plan\ntheir goals. Then, the website helps with feedback to\nachieve these goals. Other website-related interventions\ndeliver information for health prevention or health\npromotion. Two publications report on a smartphone\napp. In 15 publications, the use of various devices is re-\nported. These devices are often used to gather health-\nrelated data, for example, a pedometer to count steps.\nThere are 4 publications that report on the use of video\nconsults so that patients do not need to go to a healthcare\nfacility. Participants can use programs like Skype to have a\nvideo consultation with the nurse or general practitioner.\nIn 13 publications, the use of telehealth is reported.\nTelehealth is used to deliver online webinars. Here,\npeople can participate in a course or program. There\nare webinars to help older adults to get active or to work\non their healthy behavior.\nVirtually all e-health and m-health tools reported are\nrelated to a health promotion or primary prevention pro-\ngram for older adults. Only, one publication describes a\ntool without a health promotion or prevention program,\nthis tool is a phone-based diary (app). The majority of the\npublications report on computer tailored lifestyle pro-\ngrams (computer-based e-health programs). Specifically, a\ncomputer tailored lifestyle program has the aim to change\nunhealthy behaviors. Such program helps older adults\nwith personal goal setting and achieving these goals.\nIn addition, ten programs that we identified, are based on\nFig. 1 Search results and publication selection procedures\nThe Author(s) BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 5):290 Page 470 of 479\nproviding feedback. Feedback is provided with an inter-\nactive voice response, with the use of internet, or it is\na face-to-face feedback. These programs do not have\nto be tailor-made but could provide the same feedback for\nan entire group. Telehealth offers different programs that\nare studied in 12 publications. There are telehealth pro-\ngrams to increase physical activity among older adults.\nOther telehealth programs provide information, for ex-\nample, on stroke prevention. Telehealth programs help\nolder adults to access their health. To increase informa-\ntion for health prevention or health promotion among\nolder adults, 4 publications report on the use of online\nhealth information.\nThe third category in Table 2 portrays the study\ngroups. All publications report on the use of e-health\nand m-health tools among older adults, older adults being\ndefined as 50 years and older. The majority of the publica-\ntions (17 publications) do not have further limitations of\nTable 1 General description of publications included in the analysis (45 publications reviewed)\nClassification category Sub categories N (%) Reference index in Additional file 2\nYear of publication 2014 – 2015 15 (33.3) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 28\n2012– 2013 12 (26.7) 14, 15,16,17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,\n2010– 2011 6 (13.3) 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33,\n2008– 2009 6 (13.3) 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 44\n2006– 2007 6 (13.3) 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 45\nAim/type of study Descriptive 6 (13.3) 6, 8, 21, 23, 31, 38\nExplorative 3 (6.7) 1, 5, 27,\nExplanatory 36 (80) 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25,\n26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45\nResearch approach Qualitative (primary data) 6 (13) 2, 5, 7, 23, 31, 38\nQuantitative (primary data) 32 (69.6) 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,\n29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45\nMixed (primary data) 3 (6.5) 1, 4, 30\nDesk research (secondary data) 5 (10.9) 6, 8, 12, 13, 21\nDesign Qualitative 7 (15.2) 1, 2, 5, 7, 23, 31, 38\nQuantitative - randomized controlled trial 28 (60.9) 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27,\n28, 29, 33, 34, 37, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44\nQualitative - not randomized controlled trial 9 (19.6) 6, 13, 23, 30, 32, 35, 36, 39, 45\nSystematic review 2 (4.3) 8, 21\nData collection/design Observations 1 (2) 1\nFocus group discussion 2 (4) 2, 16\nUnstructured/semi structured interviews 7 (13)) 1, 3, 5, 7, 31, 38, 40\nStandardized questionnaires/interviews/surveys 9 (17 11, 14, 18, 20, 30, 33, 37, 42, 43\nOnline web based questionnaires/assessments 10 (19) 4, 10, 17, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 40, 44\nSecondary data/patient records 5 (10) 8, 9, 12, 13, 21\nTest results/self-report 18 (35) 6, 11, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 41, 45\nReliability// Reliability is clear 19 (42.2) 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 24, 27, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44\nReliability is unclear 22 (48.9) 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19, 23, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,\n36, 37, 39, 42, 45\nReliability is not analyzed 4 (8.9) 3, 4, 26, 30,\nValidity Validity is clear 16 (35.6) 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 15, 16, 20, 21, 30, 36, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44\nValidity is unclear 22 (48.9) 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34,\n35, 37, 39, 40, 45\nValidity is not analyzed 7 (15.6) 7, 10, 12, 17, 26, 27, 33\nGeneralizability Generalizability is clear 11 (24.4) 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 14, 16, 22, 42, 43, 45\nGeneralizability is unclear 20 (44.4) 2, 3, 11, 12, 13,17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 28, 29, 31, 34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 44\nGeneralizability is not analyzed 14 (31.1) 4, 7 10, 15, 21, 23, 26, 27, 30, 32, 33, 35, 36, 38,\nThe sum of N per category can exceed 45 as papers can be classified in multiple sub-categories\nThe Author(s) BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 5):290 Page 471 of 479\nthe study group.

Websites\nare also used within health promotion programs to pro-\nvide health-related information to older adults. Websites,\ndevices and webinars are used in computer tailored\nlifestyle programs and program providing health-related\nsupport or feedback. Telehealth programs involve the use\nof devices, video consults and webinars.\nIn Table 4, a cross-tabulation is given to show which\ntypes of e-health and m-health tools are reported in\nwhich year and in which country. For Asia, there are\nthree publications, each from the period 2008 – 2009.\nThey all report on the use of e-health tools in programs.\nFor Canada, there are two publications in the period\n2006– 2007, both about telehealth. The other publication\nin Canada is published in the period 2014 – 2015 and is\nabout the use of web-site in a computer-tailored lifestyle\nprogram.\nThe majority of the publications (17 publications) are\npublished in the last 4 years and most come from the\nUnited States. The main focus in the US studies is on\nthe use of e-health and m-health tools in computer-\ntailored lifestyle programs for older adults. In Europe,\nthe number of publications focused on older adults that\nTable 2 Characteristics of e-health and m-health tools used in health promotion and primary prevention among older adults\nClassification category Sub categories N (%) Reference index in Additional file 2\nType of e-health and\nm-health tools\nApps 2 (3.6) 1, 26\nWebsite 21 (38.2) 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29,\n35, 37, 38, 40, 43, 44\nDevice 15 (27.3) 3, 4, 7, 11, 12, 15, 21, 22, 24, 31, 32, 33, 36, 37, 42\nVideo consult (skype) 4 (7.3) 8, 39, 41, 45\nWebinars 13 (23.6) 3, 8, 13, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34,\nType of use of e-health\nand m-health tools\nUse without program (phone diary) 1 (2.2) 26\nUse in computer tailored lifestyle program 18 (40) 2, 6, 9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 35, 37, 43, 44\nUse in program providing support/feedback\n(Internet/face-face)\n10 (22.2) 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 16, 23, 34, 36\nUse in online health information 4 (8.9) 5, 19, 38, 40\nUse in telehealth programs 12 (26.7) 8, 13, 20, 21, 30, 31, 32, 33, 39, 41, 42, 45\nStudy group a No specific requirement 17 (37) 2, 4, 7, 9, 16, 17, 20, 21, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36, 39, 40, 41, 44\nWomen only 3 (6.5) 3, 10, 26\nWith risk/signs of specific disease 4 (8.7) 1, 19, 35, 45\nPhysical conditions (overweight) 14 (30.4) 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 34, 37, 43\n(Risk) Behaviors-lifestyle 3 (6.5) 14, 23, 24\nCultural group (migrants/Latino ’s/African American) 3 (6.5) 5, 15, 42\nBased on setting: in clinics/community 1 (2.2) 8\nLow computer knowledge 1 (2.2) 38\nCountry location Europe 10 (22.2) 1, 2, 7, 14, 19, 21, 26, 27, 32, 44\nUnited states 27 (60) 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25,\n28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 40, 42, 43, 45\nCanada 3 (6.7) 6, 39, 41\nAustralia 2 (4.4) 5, 18\nAsia 3 (6.7) 36, 37, 38\nThe sum of N per category can exceed 45 as papers can be classified in multiple sub-categories\naAll groups are older adults (at least 50 years old)\nThe Author(s) BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 5):290 Page 472 of 479\nwe reviewed did not increase much during the past\n10 years. There is an increased focus on programs based\non the use of e-health tools for providing support and\nfeedback for a healthy lifestyle. From the 10 publications\nwith such focus, eight have been published in the last\n4 years. These publications are from the USA and\nEurope. E-health tools in telehealth programs are reported\nbefore 2012.\nTable 5 presents a cross-tabulation of the study group\nand the type of use of e-health and m-health tools. Most\npublications with a specific study group are about phys-\nical conditions. There is only one publication that re-\nports on telehealth that aims to help older adults who\nlive in a clinic. The only publication that is focused on\nolder adults with limited computer knowledge is a pro-\ngram about online health information. Some publica-\ntions report on the use of e-health and m-health tools in\ncomputer-tailored lifestyle programs to help older adults\nget physically active. Other publications for older adults\nwith specific physical conditions report on the use of e-\nhealth and m-health tools in programs focused on\nproviding support and feedback, and one publication is\nfocused on telehealth. Studies on telehealth most often\ninclude older adults in general. Three publications re-\nport on the use of e-health and m-health tools by older\nwomen in a computer-tailored lifestyle program and\nprograms focused on providing health-related support\nand feedback.\nFacilitating factors and barriers to the use of e-health and\nm-health tools in health promotion among older adults\nFor the use of e-health and m-health tools, barriers and\nfacilitating factors are reported in the publications\nreviewed. These factors are described in Table 6. It\nshould be underlined however, that most of the factors\nlisted in Table 6, such as motivation, self-regulation, in-\nformation and rewards, are important determinants of\nbehavior change in general and not necessarily direct de-\nterminants of the use of e-health and m-health tools per\nse. At the same time, other factors in Table 6, such as\nusability and accessibility can be directly related to the\nuse of e-health and m-health tools.\nTable 3 Cross-tab for type of e-/m-health tools and type of use of e-/m-health tools among older adults\nType of e-health and m-health tool Type of use of e-health and m-health tools N (%) Reference index in Additional file 2\nApps Tool without program 1 (50) 26\nComputer tailored lifestyle program - -\nProgram providing support/feedback 1 (50) 1\nOnline health information - -\nTelehealth - -\nWebsite Tool without program - -\nComputer tailored lifestyle program 15 (71.4) 2, 6, 9, 14, 15, 17, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 35, 37, 43, 44\nProgram providing support/feedback 2 (9.5) 10, 16\nOnline health information 4 (19.1) 5, 19, 38, 40\nTelehealth - -\nDevice Tool without program - -\nComputer tailored lifestyle program 5 (33.3) 12, 15, 22, 24, 37\nProgram providing support/feedback 5 (33.3) 3, 4, 7, 11, 36\nOnline health information - -\nTelehealth 5 (33.3) 21, 31, 32, 33, 42\nVideo consult (skype) Tool without program - -\nComputer tailored lifestyle program - -\nProgram providing support/feedback - -\nOnline health information - -\nTelehealth 4 (100) 8, 39, 41, 45\nWebinars Tool without program - -\nComputer tailored lifestyle program 4 (30.8) 18, 25, 28, 29\nProgram providing support/feedback 3 (23.1) 3, 23, 34\nOnline health information - -\nTelehealth 6 (46.1) 8, 13, 20, 21, 30, 32\nThe sum of N per category can exceed 45 as papers can be classified in multiple sub-categories\nThe Author(s) BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 5):290 Page 473 of 479\nSeven types of facilitating factors are reported in the\npublications. The most often mentioned facilitating\nfactors are motivation, support and feedback. These\nare reported in 12 publications. Specifically, support re-\nceived from other participants in the e-health or m-health\nprogram is a key factor to help to change behavior. Motiv-\nation or feedback from other participants is also important\nto observe progress. This also contributes to adherence to\nthe e-health or m-health programs. Four publications in-\ndicate that it is necessary to let older adults participate in\naccordance with their own planning to change. This could\nbe accomplished by self-regulation and goal setting. Goal\nsetting and insight in how they perform, is a way to keep\nthem motivated. Information on individual progress and\nthe nature of the tool also help to facilitate the use of the\ntool. According to three publications, it is helpful if there\nis a reward system. The reward system can be based on\nboth the use of the e-health/m-health tool and concrete\nchanges in health-related behavior. This could be a finan-\ncial reward, or a reward in the sense that the participants\ncan notice progress. Three publications mentioned user-\nfriendliness as facilitating factors of the tools. If the elec-\ntronic device is simple and works easily, older adults are\nmore willing to keep using it. Two publications indicate\nthe accessibility to the tools or programs as a facilitating\nfactor. It is be better if the programs or tools are provided\nin multiple languages so that older adults could use it in\ntheir native language. For some older adults, it is better to\nTable 4 Cross-tab for year, country and type of use of e-health and m-health tools among older adults\nCountry or location Year of publication Type of use of e-health and m-health tools N (%) Reference index in\nAdditional file 2\nEurope 2014– 2015 Computer tailored lifestyle program and program providing\nsupport/feedback\n3 (30) 1, 2, 7,\n2012– 2013 Computer tailored lifestyle program, online health information, use\nwithout program\n3 (30) 14, 19, 26\n2010– 2011 Computer tailored lifestyle program and telehealth 2 (20) 21, 27\n2008– 2009 Computer tailored lifestyle program and telehealth 2 (20) 32, 44\n2006– 2007 --\nUnited states 2014 – 2015 Computer tailored lifestyle program, telehealth, and program\nproviding support/feedback\n10 (37) 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 28\n2012– 2013 Computer tailored lifestyle program and program providing\nsupport/feedback\n7 (25.9) 15, 16, 17, 22, 23, 24, 25\n2010– 2011 Computer tailored lifestyle program and telehealth 4 (14.8) 29, 30, 31, 33,\n2008– 2009 Computer tailored lifestyle program and program providing\nsupport/feedback\n2 (7.4) 34, 35,\n2006– 2007 Online health information, computer tailored lifestyle program\nand telehealth\n4 (14.8) 40, 42, 43, 45\nCanada 2014– 2015 Computer tailored lifestyle program 1 (33.3) 6\n2012– 2013 --\n2010– 2011 --\n2008– 2009 --\n2006– 2007 Telehealth 2 (66.7) 39, 41\nAustralia 2014– 2015 Online health information 1 (50) 5\n2012– 2013 Computer tailored lifestyle program 1 (50) 18\n2010– 2011 --\n2008– 2009 --\n2006– 2007 --\nAsia 2014– 2015 --\n2012– 2013 --\n2010– 2011 --\n2008– 2009 Program and program providing support/feedback, computer\ntailored lifestyle program and online health information\n3 (100) 36, 37, 38\n2006– 2007 --\nThe sum of N per category can exceed 45 as papers can be classified in multiple sub-categories\nThe Author(s) BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 5):290 Page 474 of 479\nhave access to different forms of information, for example,\nif there is also a printed version beside the online informa-\ntion.

These\nbarriers are presented in Table 6. There are seven cat-\negories of barriers. The first two categories are related to\npersonal barriers. Six publications mention barriers to\nuse of e-health and m-health tools related to personal\nchoice. This choice refers to the lack of time or other\npriorities. A solution that is indicated is to have a tool\nthat can be paused and the use can be resumed when\nthe older adult has time. Some publications mention\nthat the monetary costs of use are too high. As men-\ntioned for the facilitating factors, the lack of motivation\nand support is also most often reported as a barrier to\nthe adherence to e-health or m-health health promotion\nprograms. When there is an online support group, the\ngroup could be used to motivate each other. If the online\nsupport group is not used or only filled with negative\ncomments, then the support has a negative influence\nand becomes a barrier. According to the publications\nreviewed, there is also a lack of motivation when partici-\npants cannot reach their goals. When devices are used or\ninformation is provided, it should be clear how the device\nworks and the users should be able to understand the\ninformation that they receive. The lack of information\nor the lack of comprehensible information is mentioned\nin three publications. Barriers related to the technology\nused and the device is reported in four publications.\nThere are examples of problems with the use of internet\nor with the device. Problems with the electronic devices\ncan also be caused by sociodemographic barriers. Some-\ntimes older adults do not have the proper skills to work\nwith e-health or m-health devices. In four publications,\nsociodemographic barriers are mentioned. The sociode-\nmographic barriers are related to educational level and\nage. Three publications indicate barriers that are related\nto policy or to a lack of resources to implement the e-\nhealth program or tool.\nDiscussion\nThis systematic literature review presents evidence on\nthe scope of the use of e-health and m-health tools for\nhealth promotion and primary prevention among older\nadults, as well as the factors that influence the use of these\ntools. There are different kinds of e-health and m-health\ntools used for health promotion and primary prevention\namong older adults. These include apps, websites, devices,\nvideo consults and webinars. Many of the health promo-\ntion and primary prevention programs for older adults\nthat utilize such tools, have websites with information\non health-related aspects. This is for example the case\nwith computer-tailored lifestyle programs and telehealth\nprograms. The majority of the publications on e-health\nand m-health tools that we reviewed, study the general\nolder adult population. Only few publications report\nstudies focused on a specific older adult group. The most\ncommon specific study group consists of older adults with\na certain physical limitation, most often the need of weight\nreduction. This is not surprising as many diseases can\nbe prevented through physical activity or maintenance\nof a healthy weight [11 – 13]. This could explain why\nthere is a strong focus on older adults with weight\nproblems as a study group. The publications with this\nstudy groups most often report the use of e-health and m-\nhealth programs in a computer tailored lifestyle program.\nThis is also reported by the systematic reviews focused on\nTable 6 Factors influencing the use of e-health and m-health tools for health promotion and primary prevention among older\nadults\nClassification category Sub categories N (%) Reference index in Additional file 2\nFacilitating factors Motivation/support/feedback 12 (35.3) 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 18, 21, 29, 30, 34, 39, 43\nSelf-regulation/goal setting 4 (11.8) 9, 17, 18, 36\nInformation (progress, usefulness, awareness) 2 (5.9) 1, 31\nReward (financial, noticed physical change) 3 (8.8) 4, 6, 39\nUsability 3 (8.8) 1, 7, 26\nAccessibility (language, form – online or print) 2 (5.9) 5, 9\nRemote help at home (no travel distance) 8 (23.5) 13, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 39\nBarriers to use Personal choice lack of time/priority/cost 6 (20) 2, 3, 17, 23, 24, 34\nLack of adherence or motivation/support 8 (26.7) 3, 4, 12, 17, 24, 34, 42, 44\nUnclear device or information/wrong interpretation/lack of guidance 3 (10) 1, 7, 38\nBarriers related with technology/device 4 (13.3) 1, 3, 26, 45\nSocio demographical barriers (age, educational level, skills with electronic device) 6 (20) 2, 5, 15, 17, 38, 45\nLack or resource for telecare 1 (3.3) 31\nPolicy/reimbursement changes required 2 (6.7) 28, 29\nThe sum of N per category can exceed 45 as papers can be classified in multiple sub-categories\nThe Author(s) BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 5):290 Page 476 of 479\ne-health interventions for physical activity and dietary be-\nhavior change [14].\nDuring the past 10 years, the amount of publications\nreporting on the use of e-health and m-health tools in\nhealth promotion and primary prevention among older\nadults, has been increasing. Also, the focus of the publi-\ncations has changed through the years. At the beginning\nof the period covered by our review, there were more\npublications about telehealth. In the past 4 years, publi-\ncations more often report on the use of e-health and m-\nhealth tools in computer tailored lifestyle or programs\nthat provide support and feedback for a healthy lifestyle.\nThe results show that for different study groups, differ-\nent e-health and m-health tools are used. The choice of\nan adequate tool depends on the specificities of the par-\nticipants. This could explain why there are many differ-\nent e-health tools and programs reported [15]. Another\nexplanation for this diversity is the rapid change in the\navailable e-health m-health tools [2]. Thus, although\n40 % of the publications we reviewed, report the use of\ntelehealth for older adults in general, this might change\nin the near future as new m-health tools (such as apps)\nare becoming available [16]. Most probably, some of\nthese tools are already used by older adults, but are not\nyet studied and reported in the literature.\nIn this review, we also outline the evidence on the fa-\ncilitating factors and barriers to the use of e-health and\nm-health tools for health promotion and primary pre-\nvention among older adults. The results show different\nfacilitating factors and barriers. When the barriers are\nstudied, over 25%of the publications mentioned the lack\nof motivation, support and feedback as obstacles. At the\nsame time, the results for the facilitating factors also\nshow that strong motivation as well as adequate support\nand feedback are important for the continuity of the\nhealth program based on e-health and m-health tools. It\nis recognized hewer that these factors are important de-\nterminants of behavior change and not necessarily direct\ndeterminants of the use of e-health and m-health tools\n[13]. When health promotion and primary prevention\nprograms offer support or feedback, older adults are more\nlikely to keep using the e-health and m-health tools\noffered by the program. Motivation can be stimulated\nin different ways [17]. The most frequently mentioned\nmotivator is feedback on the extent to which people\nhave achieved their goals. Such feedback can come\nfrom a professional or a peer-support group. We find\nevidence however, that the use of an online support\ngroup can have both positive and negative effects. If\nthe feedback is formulated positively, it can be a motiv-\nation for further achievement. But if the group mostly fo-\ncuses on the negative aspects of the use of e-health\nand m-health tools, and provides more negative com-\nments, then, it can turn into a barrier. One publication\nindicates rewards as a facilitating factor. This could be not\nonly a financial reward, but also the achievement of the\nhealth goals [13, 17]. To help with the motivation, ad-\nequate goal setting is an important facilitating factor [18].\nWhen older adults have a personal aim and reachable\ngoals, they are more likely to pursue the targeted behavior\nchange and therefore, continue to use the e-health\nand m-health tools offered. If the goals are too difficult to\nreach then, this has negative effects, and the goal setting\nbecomes a barrier [18, 19].\nSome of the publications that we reviewed point to\nsociodemographical barriers. For some older adults for\nexample, it is problematic to work with new technolo-\ngies. This could be due to a low educational level or lim-\nited skills with electronic devices. When the e-health\nand m-health tools use technologies, which older adults\nalready know, the ease of use is a facilitating factor. This\ntool should also present the information in a clear and\ncomprehensible way. Also, the older adults ’ access to\nhealth promotion or primary prevention programs, can\nbe facilitated through telehealth [20]. With the use of\nthis type of e-health, older adults do not have to travel\nto benefit from such programs [21].\nAlthough our review was systematic and we took care\nto assure its quality (see Additional file 1), we still need\nto acknowledge some key limitations. A limitation of this\nreview is that the search for relevant publications is done\nin one search engine by a single researcher. Although\nPubMed is the most relevant search engine with regard to\nour topic and it includes an enormous volume of publica-\ntions, we may have missed publications on commercial e-\nhealth or m-health tools. Also, a certain bias in selecting\nrelevant publications is present since only one researcher\ndid the selection. Another limitation is that we assessed\nthe study designs in a qualitative manner without applying\na standardized protocol that could have helped us to\nquantify the strengths and weaknesses of the study de-\nsigns. Therefore, our review should be only seen as a first\nattempt to bring together evidence on the use of e-health\nand m-health tools for health promotion and primary pre-\nvention among older adults.\nWith regard to the scope of our review, we only ad-\ndress the use of m-health and e-health tools for primary\nprevention while the use of these tools is equally rele-\nvant in secondary and tertiary prevention and in treat-\nment. Such applications of m-health and e-health tools\nare widely reported in the literature [22, 23]. Also, our\nreview is exclusively focused on older adults while a\nvaluable starting point in future reviews could be the in-\nclusion of more population groups or a comparison with\nthe general population [24– 26]. In addition, as stated at\nthe outset of this paper, our review should be seen as an\ninitial step that explores the scope of the use of e-health\nand m-health tools for health promotion and primary\nThe Author(s) BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 5):290 Page 477 of 479\nprevention among older adults. We were unable to ex-\nplore the effectiveness of e-health and m-health tools\namong older adults. Specifically, our review captures stud-\nies with very different objectives. For example, some of the\nstudies focus on the effectiveness of e-health and m-\nhealth programs, while others not. Even if we only exam-\nine studies that specifically focus on the effectiveness of e-\nhealth and m-health programs, the focus is not necessarily\non the effectiveness of the e-health and m-health tools\nbut rather on the effectiveness of the programs in\ngeneral. Thus, the outcomes measured do not reflect the\neffects of e-health and m-health tools, but the more gen-\neral objective of the study. Subsequent more specific re-\nviews focused on the effectiveness of e-health and m-\nhealth tools and programs for older adults within specific\nsettings need to be conducted to obtain a better under-\nstanding of how such programs should be designed and\nimplemented.\nConclusions\nThe results of this systematic literature review show that\nthe relevance of e-health and m-health tools in health\npromotion and primary prevention among older adults\nis recognized and that there are a variety of uses of such\ntools. Also, the research focused on this issue is increasing\nsince more publications have appeared in recent years. It\nseems however, that the use of e-health and m-health\ntools in health promotion programs for older adults, is\nmostly an isolated initiative, especially outside the US.\nEuropean countries for example, that experience a fast\npopulation aging, could specifically benefit from the use of\ne-health and m-health tools in health promotion and pri-\nmary prevention programs among older adults. If these\nprograms are designed with caution to avoid potential bar-\nriers (as those outlined here), and if the cost-effectiveness\nof the programs can be demonstrated in future studies,\ngovernments might be willing to consider their expansion\nand funding. In this regard, more evidence on the effect-\niveness and cost-effectiveness of e-health and m-health\nhealth promotion programs for older adults is needed.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: PRISMA 2009 Checklist.
