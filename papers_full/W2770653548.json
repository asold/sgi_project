Radical embodied cognitive science. Postphenomonology.\nJewellery making . Dynamic systems . Uncontrolled manifold hypothesis\n1 Introduction\nThis paper is about the ways in which people, specifically jewellers, create objects.\nJewellery making is an area of human activity in which cognition, creativity and\nphysical performance meet. We will argue that such behaviour can provide fertile\nground for considering cognition and creativity. In order to develop the argument, we\nwill apply the frame of radical embodied cognitive science (RECS) to data collected in\nlaboratory and field settings (where the sources of these data range from interviews to\ndata collected using motion capture and sensors fitted to tools) to explore tool use and\ncreativity. We feel, as Hutchins ( 1995) emphasised, that the primary way to appreciate\nembodied activity is through the study of skilled practitioners in their places of work.\nOur concern is with the ways in which technological artefacts (and, in this context, we\nmean the tools, the equipment, the materials and the workplace) play a role in shaping\njeweller’s activity and, specifically, in shaping creativity. Of particular relevance to our\ndiscussion are Ihde ’s( 1990, 2009) notions of embodiment, hermeneutic, alterity and\nbackground relations between humans and technology. We will draw links between\nthese relations and our observations to show how technology mediates human activity\nthrough a process of mutual co-construction and argue that ‘creativity’arises from the\ndynamic interplay between jewellers and their technology.\nJewellers’ engagement with their creative pr actice has received surprisingly\nlimited attention in the literature (Rajili et al. 2015). One can draw parallels\nbetween jewellery and other artisanal prac tices, such as pottery, glassmaking and\nfurniture making, and realise that the processes of ‘designing’ and ‘making’ are\noften difficult to disentangle (Malafouris 2008;I n g o l d 2010). Mäkinen ( 2005)\nfound that jewellers include ‘making’ in their account of design practice. In\njewellery making, it is necessary to combine knowledge of metallurgy and gem-\nstones, with craft skills and an ability to c reate aesthetic designs. The craft skills\nthemselves involve a wide range of techniques from cutting and setting stones to\npiercing and cutting metal, to casting metal and construction of finished pieces.\nThese craft skills encompass the jewellers ’ know-how and are typically not\nseparated from their design skills. From this, one could suggest that ‘creativity’\nis simply a consequence of skilled perfor mance of physical activity, but this feels\nunsatisfactory in terms of a concept of creativity as an ability to create something\nnovel (as opposed to the well-practised a bility to repeat previous designs).\n2 Creativity and Action in Jewellery Making\nIngold ( 2010) traces back to Aristotle, the common conceptualisation of craftwork or\nartistic practice as a matter of bringing form ( morphe)t om a t t e r( hyle). This\n‘hylomorphic’concept presupposes that form is imposed on matter, often as the result\nof an idea that is conceived prior to the act of making. Ingold ( 2010) challenges the idea\nthat ‘creativity’is solely concerned with imagining the form in one ’s mind prior to the\n284 C. Baber et al.\nphysical act of making. In this paper, we will develop a similar argument, albeit taking\na different route to the conclusion. Before developing the argument, it is useful to\nconsider a contemporary account of creativity which has an (perhaps unintended)\nemphasis on hylomorphism. Boden ( 1996) offers two types of creativity which she\nterms ‘improbabilist’and ‘impossibilist’. In the former, a novel combination familiar\nideas represents something that is new to the individual (which Boden also calls\npsychological or P-creativity), and the latter involves the mapping, exploring and\ntransforming of conceptual spaces to create new ideas which could not have generated\npreviously (which Boden call historical or H-creativity). This suggests that a character-\nistic of creative activity lies in making unfamiliar combinations of familiar ideas,\nthrough exploring and transforming conceptual spaces. For Boden, creativity is a\ncognitive act that is performed in the head. Her theory motivates a research agenda in\nartificial intelligence (AI) in which she explores ways in which computers could be\ncapable of creativity in this manner. However, this separation of ‘creation-in-the-head’\nand a physical behaviour that is merely the acting out of this ‘cognition’seems to miss an\nessential aspect of the jeweller ’s work. Boden ( 1996) and related accounts of creativity\nimply that the creative act must plan, predict and script the actions which need to be\nperformed. However, it is not obvious that it what happens in jewellery making. In their\naccount of studio jewellers, Wuytens and Willems ( 2009), following the lead of Schön\n(1983), suggest that work involves three processes in a chain of reflective moments,\nwhich focus on ‘design parameter’, ‘design cluster’and ‘backtracking’.\n‘Design parameter reflection ’involves exploring, reflecting upon and elaborating\nthe constraints that are implied by a given design brief. In some sense, design parameter\nreflection could be seen as an example of Ihde ’s( 1990) hermeneutic relation, in that the\njeweller is reading the potential design. In this case, such a reading involves both the\ngiven material (in what state it currently exists) and the possible states that it could\nachieve, given the constraints under which it is being worked. There are several means\nby which constraints can be explored. One might be to create a sketch of the intended\ndesign. When it is used, the sketch is a means of thinking through, or explaining, the\ntechnical problems of making an item (Baber and Saini 1995). Pereira and Tschimmel\n(2012), in their account of designing a series of pieces suggested by Saint Saëns\n‘Carnival of the Animals ’, note that sketching is used to create ‘ideation drawings ’\nused to explore concepts. ‘By drawing, the designer expands the problem space of the\nproject task, to the extent of including and even discovering, new aspects, which he /\nshe considers relevant, as much as through a subsequent interpretation of the graphic\nrepresentations.’(p. 104). In other words, the jeweller ’s sketch is not a fully dimen-\nsioned engineering drawing that the jeweller replicates in whatever material is being\nused. In this way, the sketch does not serve as a template for the final product or a plan\nfor manufacture so much as a physical form of problem solving.\nThe sketch externalises a potential design, both in terms of making the design visible\nso that it can provide ‘feedback’to the jeweller (or to the jeweller ’s client) but also in\nterms of a physical action of moving pencil across paper to reveal unexpected,\nunanticipated and new opportunities of form (Schön 1983). The hermeneutic relations\nof reading the form that the piece could take is, thus, partly a cognitive act of\nresponding to the visual appearance of the sketch (or the material) and partly a physical\nexploration of the ways in which materials can be modified. In other words, in\nexploring alternative designs, the jeweller could be said to be instantiating ‘events’,\nWhat the jeweller ’s hand tells the jeweller ’s brain: tool use,... 285\nwhich Chemero ( 2000) defines in terms of the layout of affordances in the animal-\nenvironment system. From this point of view, sketching is a means by which the\njeweller’s relation to the environment can be reflected upon and, as such, becomes a\nway of exploring ‘conceptual spaces ’(Boden 1996) through physical as much as\ncognitive activity. In large part, the sketch provides an opportunity to consider the\nconstraints that could affect making. However, sketching is also an act in itself and the\nsketch rarely becomes the formal blueprint for the object to be made. If the role of the\nsketch is to provide a way of exploring potential design options, then one can see how\nthis could be replaced, or complemented, by the physical manipulation of the materials\nbeing worked. Accounts of jewellery practice emphasise the experimental nature of the\nconstruction work itself. Pereira and Tschimmel ( 2012)n o t et h a t ‘The creation of\njewellery involves processes, which are often very experimental and intuitive,\nencompassing both the creative process and production techniques .’[p. 97]. This is\nsimilar to the suggestion that physical activity on objects can support problem solving.\nFor example, in their study of Tetris playing, Kirsh and Maglio ( 1994) distinguish\nbetween the pragmatic acts involved in moving the pieces to form patterns, and the\nepistemic actions involved in moving the pieces in an exploratory manner to see\nwhether patterns are available. In a study of the ‘wolves and chicken’problem, Guthrie\net al. ( 2015) show that the ability to interact with physical objects led to a reduction in\n‘illegal’moves and a reduction in decision latency (suggesting that participants were\nmore efficient when they could manipulate physical objects than when they verbalised\nthe approach to the problem). Steffensen et al. ( 2015), in a fine-grained analysis of\nstrategy in solving the 17 Animals problem, demonstrate how rearranging the physical\nartefacts in the task led to serendipitous recognition of the path to a solution. In each of\nthese examples, the interactivity between the person and the materials to hand create\nopportunities for the recognition of probl em solutions. As one of the jewellers\ninterviewed by Rajili et al. ( 2015) puts it, jewellery design involves ‘…being very\nanalytic and then go[ing] back to working with your hands then look[ing] at what\nyou’ve been doing and analysing it and taking it further. … it allows you to kind of\ndigest your thought and it ’s there in the back of your head all time anyway and so it\nkind of leads you anyway towards what you would like to express. ’This quotation\ncould be read in terms of Boden ’s( 1996) notion of a cognitive act ( ‘in the back of your\nhead all the time ’) which informs and guides creativity. But we claim that the quotation\nis also contrary to Boden ’s understanding of creativity as a cognitive act followed by\nconstruction acts. Rather, there is a constant interplay between what is happening ‘in\nthe head’and the what is being done with materials.\n‘Design cluster reflection ’involves grouping aspects of constraints together to\nconsider how dependencies can be tackled. In her account of creative practice, Malinin\n(2016) proposes that creative cognition is embodied, embedded and enacted. In part\nthis reflects the observation that skilled practitioners do not distinguish between the tool\nas an external artefact and their hands but, rather, feel the tool as part of themselves\n(Baber 2003;S e n n e t t2008). This illustrates Ihde ’s( 1990) embodiment relations in that\njewellers regard the tools, materials, decorative objects or other features of their settings\nas things to think with. This form of ‘ep\n istemic action’(Kirsh and Maglio 1994)c o u l d\ninvolve manipulating a stone to catch the light or experimenting with the arrangement\nof pieces prior to assembly which, in turn, suggest particular solutions to the mounting\nor construction problem.\n286 C. Baber et al.\nWuytens and Willems’(2009)n o t i o n so f‘constraint’and ‘backtracking’relate to the\nproperties of the materials being worked and the visual appearance of the finished\ndesign. This calls to mind Deleuze and Guaterri ’s( 2004) focus on materials and forces\n(which a theoretical stance Ingold ( 2010) builds upon). The notion of constraint can be\nrelated to Boden ’s( 1996) notion of conceptual space, in that the ‘creative’solution to\nthe problem of producing a piece of jewellery involves appreciating opportunities\noffered within a space of constraints. In Pereira and Tschimmel ’s( 2012) terms, ‘A\ncreative perception of the situation depends mainly on the designers ’previous experi-\nence and from [the] ability to handle [a] wealth of experience in a flexible and\nimaginative way, applying creative thinking operations, such as associative thinking,\nthinking in analogies, visual reasoning and perception with all of the senses. ’(p. 98).\n3 Chopping Logs and Making Jewellery: Outcome Criteria and Creativity\nIn Ihde’s( 2012) account of wood chopping, the wood is the ‘focal core’[Ihde 2012,p .\n30] to which attention is directed, with the tool (axe), the praxis associated with the tool\nand the self as a wielder of the tool all being secondary foci of attention. Anyone who\nhas wielded an axe knows that none but the most expert can guarantee that the spot they\npick will be exactly the spot that the axe hits, and even if this is the same spot, it will not\nguarantee that the wood will split. If a log is split into sizes which can feed a wood\nburner or which can be put into a log basket, then this tends to be sufficient. There\nremains a troublesome misreading of this description, which is that the tool-user has an\nintention which is brought forth by their use of the tool. This is similar to Boden ’s\nnotion that ‘creativity’begins as an intention, in the head, and is then realised through\naction. For Malafouris ( 2013), this problematic arises because of the assumptions that\ncan be implicitly made about ‘intention’. In his account of flint knapping (which echoes\nmuch of the discussion in the next section, albeit from a different perspective and using\ndifferent terminology), Malafouris ( 2013)s u g g e s t st h a t‘The decisions about where to\nplace the next blow and how much force to use are not taken by the knapper in\nisolation; they are not even processed internally. The flaking intention is constituted, at\nleast partially, by the stone itself. Information about the stone is not internally repre-\nsented and processed by the brain to form the representational content of the knapper ’s\nintentional stance. Instead, the stone, like the knapper ’s body, is an integral and\ncomplimentary part of the intention to knap. ’[p. 173]. From this, one can see why\nMalafouris (2013) argues so strongly, in his Material Engagement Theory, that one does\nnot simply act upon artefacts but rather that one actively engages and interacts with\nthem. For Ihde ’s( 1990) postphenomonology, this active engagement involves the\nmutual constitution and co-construction of intent between human and technology in\nwhich human relations with their world becomes transformed through the technologies\nthey use.\nFor Malafouris ( 2008) assuming that the human is an agent who acts upon inert\nobjects presents a misconception of the timescale at which actions take place. In part,\nthis stems from an over-reliance on local notions of cause and effect. If one extends the\ntimescale, he argues, then one can see an interplay of acting and responding that shifts\nbetween human and object. In its suggestion that we need to rethink the way in which\ntiming of actions is considered, this supports the focus on time-series analysis that is at\nWhat the jeweller ’s hand tells the jeweller ’s brain: tool use,... 287\nthe root of the dynamic systems approaches inherent in RECS. Agency, as a central\ntenet of Material Engagement Theory, emerges through the interactivity of person and\nmaterial. An ‘agent’, in this respect, can be anything which shapes or influences the\nbehaviour of something else. Thus, in flint knapping, the stone being worked, the\nhammer stone and the hand of the knapper could all take on the role of ‘agent’at\ndifferent times in the ongoing interaction.\nIn both log splitting and flint knapping, we can recognise the end-state of an action\nwhen it occurs (as desirable or not) but it is not so easy to provide accurate prediction of\nwhen that state will occur or what form the resulting product will be in all situations.\nRather, the outcome relies on a combination of the kinetic energy and angle of\nincidence of the impact, together with the properties of the material. For Ingold\n(2006), this combination of factors characterises the skilled tool user; the force,\namplitude, speed and torque of the moving tool; and the posture and movements of\nthe tool-user change from stroke to stroke. For us, this is a defining feature of the\ndynamic systems modelling of human activity which is central to RECS. Consequently,\nthere is a mediation between the material ’ss t a t ea n dt h e ‘system’that changes the\nmaterial’s state. Bateson ’s( 1972) account of tree-felling involves the system of ‘tree-\neyes-brain-muscles-axe-stroke-tree’(p. 317). This idea of a ‘system’(comprising tool,\nmaterial, person etc.) foregrounds the theme of this paper, which is to ask how actions\nthat are performed can be managed as part of a complex, co-adaptive and creative\nsystem. If tool-using actions can be described in terms of system dynamics, then there\nremains an open question concerning the ‘cognition’at play here. If one assumes a\nseparation of the physical act of using a tool and the cognitive acts involved in\ncreativity, then there seems to be an impasse. A way around this is to turn to a\nconceptualisation of cogn ition which is sense-satura ted (Cowley and Vallée-\nTourangeau 2013), embodied (Chemero 2009) and materially engaged (Malafouris\n2013). In this manner, cognition becomes a matter of managing the coordinated\naccumulation of sensory experience, together with the performance of appropriate\nactions in response to these experiences and the constraints provided by a given\nsituation for a given system. Embodiment relations, therefore, become not only a\nway of acting but also a way of knowing; with experience and practice, the skilled\njeweller is able to anticipate changes in material and to respond to these through\nchanges in the use of the tools and equipment.\nFor the jeweller, the finished product has to meet certain culturally defined, aesthetic\nstandards. Not only does this mean that the final product is evaluated in terms of\nquality, but also that the consequences of each stage of the production process could be\nevaluated in terms of its potential impact on the finished piece; sloppiness in the initial\nstages creates the need for reworking or, at least, corrective action, later on. In terms of\nhermeneutic relations, the reading of the piece must occur over several different levels\nand timescales: the jeweller reads the piece as it develops from instant to instant,\nmaking adjustments in action to maintain the development; the jeweller refines the idea\nof the ‘finished’piece as it develops; the jeweller develops the physical appearance of\nthe piece (its size, shape, weight, look etc.) in terms of the aesthetics that would be most\nappropriate for the potential wearer of the piece. In jewellery making, one could say\nthat the hermeneutics are applied on past (pieces like this one that had been made\npreviously), present (how this piece looks at this precise moment) and future (how the\npiece is likely to turn out). One jeweller we spoke to said that they like to ensure that all\n288 C. Baber et al.\nfeatures were finished to a high standard, even if the part becomes hidden by other\npieces or is on the back of the piece, not because it can be seen but because the jeweller\nwill know it is there. Valuing these ‘hidden’features makes less sense from a view that\nassumes the form is imagined and then created (unless one either assumes that the\nimagined form has a totality of the visible and hidden aspects), but makes far more\nsense if one assumes that creativity reflects the dynamic interplay between craftworker\nand material. It also makes sense if these hermeneutic relations are mediated by\nembodiment relations (Ihde 1990). If a dynamic systems ’account of activity is to\nchallenge the hylomorphic tradition that Ingold ( 2010) identified or to speak against the\n(representational) schema-based approaches that Chemero ( 2009) challenges, then it\nalso needs to be able to speak as clearly of actions and outcomes in the future as it does\nof actions and outcomes in the here and now.\n4 Dexterity, Dynamics and Tool Use\nWorking in the tradition of Bernstein (1967), Bril and her colleagues have been\nexploring the question of dexterity in the use of tools. Much of this work has\nconcentrated on the ways in which stone is worked, either in terms of flint knapping\n(Bril et al. 2010, 2012; Nonaka et al. 2010; Parry et al. 2015;R e i ne ta l . 2013)o ri n\nterms of stone-bead making (Biryukova and Bril 2008; Roux et al. 1995). Across a\nseries of studies, Bril demonstrates that differences between expert and novice\npractitioners can be explained in terms of the ability to respond to contextual\ndemands. To paraphrase Bernstein, dexterity is not simply a matter of more coor-\ndinated bodily movement but an enhanced responsiveness to the surrounding\nconditions. Such responsiveness can be measured in terms of behaviour, e.g. in\nterms of precision, flexibility, regularity, adaptability, smoothness, swiftness and\noptimisation. Following the lead of Bernst ein, Bril considers behaviour as arising\nfrom the recognition, and satisfaction, of task-specific mechanical constraints.\nThese mechanical constraints could inc lude the force to apply, the velocity or\ndistance to move the tool to produce such force and the angle of incidence for\nimpacts between tool and material. The constraints define the functional parameters\nwhich need to be managed in order to achieve successful performance in the task,\nand Bril ’s work shows how experts and novices differ in their ability to work to\nthese functional parameters. Given the range of actions that people could perform\n(as indicated in the well-known degrees of freedom problem\n1), Bril follows Bern-\nstein in proposing a hierarchical control model. In this approach, functional param-\neters can be achieved through regulatory parameters through which the person\n1 Bernstein (1967) famously proposed that all human movement involved the need to solve the degrees of\nfreedom, or motor equivalence, problem. The human arm (from shoulder to hand) has joints at the shoulder,\nelbow and wrist. Each of these joints can move in more than one direction, and each direction of movement\ncan be thought of as a degree of freedom. This means that any movement of the arm could involve seven\ndegrees of freedom (three about the shoulder — yaw, pitch and roll; one about the elbow— pitch; three about\nthe wrist— yaw, pitch and roll). The suggestion that there are seven degrees of freedom assumes that one is\nonly interested in the motion of joints. However, there are further degrees of freedom arising from the agonist-\nantagonist activity of muscles connected to the joints, and the manner in which muscle control is coordinated.\nFrom this, any movement could involve more than one solution.\nWhat the jeweller ’s hand tells the jeweller ’s brain: tool use,... 289\ncontrols specific movement parameters. For instance, experts (flint knappers and\nstone bead makers) seek to hold the functional parameter (kinetic energy) constant\nwhen they use different types of hammer or material, while novices vary kinetic\nenergy with different types of hammer. Recently, this concept was applied to the\ncomparison of jewellers performing sim ple sawing tasks, showing the experience\nrelates to the grip force applied to the handle and to the velocity of the saw blade\nduring cutting (Baber et al. 2015).\nAs Bernstein noted, it is important to incorporate feedback into the closed loop\ncontrol of motion, in terms of the interaction between person and environment. This\nfeedback can be seen as a means of managing the dynamics of the human-tool-\nenvironment system. Rather than considering movement as the enactment of a program\nor schema, an alternative view is to consider the control parameters which need to be\noptimised. Thus, an optimal control model would seek to determine the ‘cost function’\nwhich is being minimised while allowing the goal of the movement to be achieved.\nBernstein spoke of coordinative structures in which combinations of muscle activation\nbecome associated with specific movement in levels of synergy. As activity is per-\nformed, the interactions between elements in the coordinative structure vary, depending\non the way in which it is being controlled and the way in which it is affected by the\nenvironment around it. This frames the point made by Ingold ( 2010), cited earlier, that\nthere is a moment-by-moment, stroke-by-stroke variation in the tool wielding move-\nments of the skilled craftworker. In this way, one can consider activity in terms of softly\nassembled systems in which activity is contextually constrained and embodied and in\nwhich repetitive actions share a ‘family resemblance’but exhibit variability.\nLocal interactions among embodied processes on different timescales weave the\nintrinsic fluctuations of the component processes into a coherent fabric of flux,\ndespite inherent tendencies of the different processes to vary at their own different\nrates (on their own timescales). Competitions among local rates of change strike a\nprecise balance with globally emerging cooperative activity. In the precise bal-\nance of (or near) the critical state, they produce a long-range correlated, aperiodic\np a t t e r no fc h a n g eo rf l u xi nb e h a v i o u r… The aperiodic flux is called 1/f noise …\n(Kloos and Van Orden 2009,p .2 5 9 ) .\n1/f noise can be applied across different cognitive tasks to indicate a ‘softly\nassembled’system focussing on interaction-dominant dynamics (component dynamics\nalter interactions) rather than component-dominant dynamics (behaviour arises from\ncomponents, demarcated and assigned specific functions). Richardson and Chemero\n(2014) show how 1/f scaling has been observed across a wide range of human\nactivities. In part, this reflects the motor component of the activity being studied and\nthe ability of people to adapt to situational demands as embodied systems. For example,\nDotov et al. ( 2010) demonstrate that hand-mouse coordination in a simple video game\nexhibits 1/f scaling during normal operation but not when the task is disrupted. This\nindicates that, during normal operation, hand-mouse control can be described as an\ninteraction-dominant system. Applying this concept to jewellers, 1/f scaling can distin-\nguish skill levels in the use of jewellery saws (Baber and Starke 2015). Furthermore,\nthere are activities which would be considered cognitive, i.e. possessing less\n290 C. Baber et al.\ndependence on motor control, which such scaling. For example, Stephen et al. ( 2009)\ndemonstrate the making inferences correspond to the fractal dynamics of eye move-\nments when solving problems. As Richardson and Chemero ( 2014)n o t e , ‘This indi-\ncates that even leaps of insight do not occur in the brain alone –the eye movements are\npart of the interaction dominant system that realizes the cognitive act. ’(p. 45). Thus,\nthere is compelling evidence that human activity exhibits long-term stability (or\nrepeated patterns of variability) that indicate the existence of interaction-dominant\nsystems. While the patterns that 1/f scaling provides a means of analysing the temporal\ndynamics of activity, they do not provide clues as to how actions might be coordinated\nor controlled. To consider this, we turn to an approach which considers the control\nmechanisms of interaction-dominant systems.\n5 Uncontrolled Manifold Hypothesis\nOne of the studies that Bernstein conducted involved an early form of kinematic\nanalysis to explore variability in a blacksmith ’s movements. When a repetitive\naction is performed, such as hammering or sawing, the action is highly stereotyped\nbut each instance differs from the others . In other words, these actions exhibit\nvariability across repetitions. Bernstein noticed that the variability in the position\nof the hammer ’s head was smaller than variability in each of the joints in the arm\nholding the hammer as it was swung to hit the target. Rather than specifying the\nmovement for each joint, coordination appears to involve the management of a\n‘unit’(which he terms a coordinative struct ure) which exhibits kinematic redun-\ndancy. Assume that you move your hand towards an object that you intend to\ntouch. The degrees of freedom (about shoulder, elbow and wrist) mean that there\nare many ways in which this action can be performed, e.g. imagine approaching\nthe object from its left or its right side and you can appreciate differences in\npossible movement. If one considers the movement around each joint, then there\nare times when each joint ’s movement appears to be towards the object and other\ntimes when the movement might be orthogonal to the object. From this, one can\nassume that there is a set of movements which can be described as controlled, i.e.\ntowards the object, and a set which are not. Scholz and Schöner ( 1999)p r o p o s e\nthat the ratio between motion in the ‘towards the object’ space and the orthogonal\nspace can be used to indicate the degree of control within a ‘unit’. The uncon-\ntrolled manifold hypothesis (UCM) assumes that movement control involves the\nfixing of some parameters with others being left free. This neatly follows\nBernstein’s concept of coordinative structures and assumes that not all aspects\nof movement are controlled (thus reducing the degrees of freedom which need to\nbe solved). This reduces the complexity of the control problem and assumes that\nmovements tend to focus control on a few parameters. This echoes Bril ’sn o t i o no f\nregulatory parameters.\nTo appreciate how UCM seeks to describe the control of movement, let us\nassume a movement of the hand reaching to wards an object on the table directly in\nfront of you. In this case, movement on a horizontal plane, with single degree of\nfreedom for shoulder, elbow and wrist, can be defined in terms of discrete position\nin two-dimensional space. At any time, the position on a given joint in space can\nWhat the jeweller ’s hand tells the jeweller ’s brain: tool use,... 291\nbe defined in terms of x, y coordinates in terms of a function ( f)o ft h ea n g l eo ft h e\nthree joints, i.e.\nx; yðÞ ¼ f θ1; θ2; θ3ðÞ\nMore specifically, the positions of each link (L) in the reaching system (shoulder, l 1;\nelbow, l2 and wrist, l 3) can be defined for x and y as:\nx ¼ l1cos θ1ðÞ þ l2cos θ2ðÞ þ l3cos θ3ðÞ\ny ¼ l1sin θ1ðÞ þ l2sin θ2ðÞ þ l3sin θ3ðÞ\nAssume that motion is in line with the target path (||UCM) or perpendicular to that\npath ( ⊥UCM). The ratio of ||UCM/ ⊥UCM indicates whether the movement is ‘con-\ntrolled’(or stabilised). If you sample the movement at defined time intervals, e.g. take\nthe total movement time and divide into ten equal segments, it is possible to plot the\nratio of ||UCM to ⊥UCM at each time interval. As the ratio approaches zero, the degree\nof control is relatively low, and as the ratio increases towards or above 1, then the\ndegree of control is relatively high.\nFigure 1 shows the UCM ratio of hand and end of saw for two sawing tasks. The\ndata were averaged from five people performing sawing tasks for around 20 s each, and\nthe data were collected using Motion Capture equipment with markers on shoulder,\nelbow, wrist, hand and the end of the saw. One task involved sawing vertically into a\npiece of wood. This is an unusual posture for the participants, who were unfamiliar\nwith this style of sawing. Figure 1 has two pairs of lines (indicating the hand and saw\nperforming the horizontal, H, and vertical, V , movements). The lines on Fig. 1 for\nV_hand and V_saw show the UCM ratios are above 1 (which indicates a high level of\ncontrol) and that the line for V_hand tracks that of V_saw, suggesting that the hand and\n292 C. Baber et al.\nFig. 1 UCM from pooled data from five participants performing two sawing tasks\nsaw are forming a combined unit for this task. One might expect this to be the case, if\none assumes that a tool is always an extension of the person. However, the line for\nH_saw is higher than that for H-hand, suggesting that there is more control of the saw\nthan the hand, but there is little alignment between the two ratios. The slight peak in the\n‘H_saw’line could represent the point at which the saw changed direction, perhaps as a\nresult of a little ‘kick’at the end of each forward stroke. There is little difference in the\nhand ratio, suggesting that the focus of attention was on moving the saw, with the hand\n(potentially) separate from the saw. One interpretation of this discrepancy (between\nvertical and horizontal sawing) is that the ‘system’that is required to perform a given\ntask will be assembled using the minimum number of components that need to be\nbrought under control, and that practice with the familiar horizontal task reduces the\nnumber of components.\nThe point that we are illustrating through the use of 1/f scaling and UCM is that it is\npossible to describe human activity using time-series analysis and the mathematics of\ndynamic systems. These approaches help to bring into focus the ways in which the\ncontinual balance between variability and consistency in human activity can be de-\nscribed. Such dynamic systems analyses necessarily emphasise the interplay between\nthe components of the human-tool-material ‘system’. In other words, we present this as\nan illustration of task differences arising from the manner in which soft-assembled\nsystems might function. It also shows how the trade-offs between functional and\nregulatory parameters that Bril describes become an important feature of skilled\nperformance and suggest that the moment-by-moment adjustment in the control of\nthese parameters (as illustrated by Fig. 1) reflects the shifting emphasis in stroke-by-\nstroke movement that Ingold ( 2010) describes and, potentially, the changes in locus of\nagency that Malafouris ( 2008, 2013)p r e s e n t s .\n6 Temporal Dynamics of Human-Tool-Material Systems\nTwo metals can be heated in a crucible to produce an alloy that can be poured into\na mould. The melting points of the metals (and their transition from solid to\nmolten) can be defined in terms of quantifiable states in this process. The\nexperienced jeweller can look at the m etal as it melts and estimate when it is\nmost ready for pouring. Thus, the changes in colour or other indicator of the\nmetals’‘states’could reflect some vocabulary of a particular workshop and these\nmight be more difficult to quantify (than, say, temperature). This could mean that\ndifferent workshops will develop a differen t way of explaining and, consequently,\ntraining the recognition of such states. In this instance, the ‘state’could refer to\nany condition of the material as it is being worked.\nA jeweller might work to avoid undesired states. Examples in jewellery production\ncould include material too hot/cold, material bent/stretched out of true, soldering too\nmessy or joint too weak. The way in which these undesired states are recognised and\ndealt with (accept and continue with the work, correct or scrap) defines the work\npractice of a workshop. In terms of creativity, these also provide opportunities for the\nproduction process to move along lines that might not originally have been intended,\ne.g. an ‘accident’, where a piece is bent out of shape, could create an interesting design\nthat could be worked further.\nWhat the jeweller ’s hand tells the jeweller ’s brain: tool use,... 293\nAn agate cabochon (i.e. slice of agate which has been cut with a flat back and domed\nface) could be mounted in a bezel (which would be flush with setting and would cover\nthe edges of the stone) or a claw (which would show the stone ’s edge) or wire-wrapped\n(see Fig. 2).\nProduction of the cabochon itself can take the form of an ellipse (in which lack of\nsymmetry can be hidden from all but the closest visual inspection in ways that are\nharder to disguise with circular designs), and this shape will be cut from a piece of stone\nand then trimmed to a stencil before being polished (depending on the desired finish).\nThus, when the jeweller selects an agate cabochon in a bezel setting, there are already a\nwhole set of practices, techniques and design criteria to which this selection commits\nher. The decision could be influenced by the way that the stone responds to working or\nby the use of a pre-wrought bezel into which to fit the stone. As the stone is worked so\nthe jeweller might decide to switch from bezel to wire wrapping. The choice of\nmounting commits the jeweller to a course of action. The performance of the action\nthen creates possible variations, e.g. a claw mount could involve four parts positioned\nsymmetrically around the edge of the stone, but the definition of ‘symmetry’in this\ncase could depend on how the stone is oriented. So the jeweller might turn the stone to\nsee how light reflects from it in different orientations prior to creating the claw. In these\nexamples, ‘design parameter reflection’is the interplay between the state of the material\nbeing worked and jeweller ’s response to that state. This suggests that jewellers are able\nto recognise aesthetically pleasing options as they arise without having fully formed\nmental images (or, indeed, detailed drawing) against which to work. In fact, the\noriginality of pieces of jewellery will come from the jeweller ’s ability to present the\nstone in its best possible light rather than simply replicating another design.\nA jeweller might arrange the environment in such a way as to support the transition\nfrom one part of the production process to the next. This could be deliberate, as in\nlaying out components of a multi-feature design and moving these around until the\narrangement looks acceptable, or manipulating the setting for a stone so that the stone\ndoes not require cutting. Or it could involve gathering the tools to perform a specific\nfunction, or allocating different areas of the workshop to functions. This would ensure\nthat the equipment required is available and that the location of the equipment and the\nmaterial to be worked on is ready to hand. Keller and Keller ( 1996) speak of the layout\nof a blacksmith ’s forge in terms of a taskonomy, suggesting that the experienced smith\ncould look at the current state of a colleague ’s forge and has an idea of what is being\nmade. This use of objects in the world can also apply to the creation of jewellery itself.\n294 C. Baber et al.\nFig. 2 Types of setting for cabochon (from left: wire-wrapped, bezel/pendant, claw)\nA jeweller could use simple concepts to convey a complex design. For example,\nassume a stone of a given diameter to be fitted into a round brooch. The brooch could\nhave other jewels to offset the central one; these could be arranged along four lines of\nsymmetry (shown as dotted lines in Fig. 3).\nPrinciples of symmetry and balance serve to constrain the choices of placement of\nstones in this design. Of course, the jeweller might opt to subvert symmetrical patterns\nbut this would still be a decision that is shaped by the lines of symmetry expressed by\nFig. 3.\nA jeweller might arrange their body in response to the task being performed and in\npreparation to move to the next task. This postural predisposition is common in sports\nand involves placing the limbs in position to complete one action and begin the next. In\nUCM terms, this involves shifting control between body segments. Rosenbaum et al.\n(2014) demonstrated the ways in which people adopt uncomfortable postures initially\nbecause they are seeking comfort in an end-state (turning wine glasses) or in order to\nexert maximal torque (faucets). Similarly, reach-to-grasp actions are modified by\nperceived properties of object (Jeannerod 1997;W i n ge ta l . 1997). In these examples,\nposture is adapted to suit future task demands. The posture we adopt not only\n‘anticipates’the end of the movement but also defines the regulatory parameters to\nmonitor. This, in turn, constrains the functional parameters which can be managed. Of\ncourse, there is likely to be a trade-off here but the initial conditions limit the functional\nparameters. Initial conditions would be morphological type of grasp, orientation of tool\netc. as well as motoric (effort etc.), and each of these can be influenced by the type of\ntool being used, the experience of the tool user, the material being worked and the effect\nto be achieved.\nA common technique in the production of metal items involves laying a sheet of the\nmetal, say silver, over a form (Fig. 4). The form can be carved into a dome or further\ncarved with shapes and features. As the sheet is hammered against the form, so it\nbegins to take on the shape of the form.\nSo, one can imagine a sheet of silver laid over a dome and hammered until it forms a\nbowl. The dimensions of the form and the thickness of the metal set some of the\nWhat the jeweller ’s hand tells the jeweller ’s brain: tool use,... 295\nFig. 3 Placement of stones in a symmetrical pattern\nconstraints of the task. Some silversmiths will mark concentric circles on the sheet to\nguide their activity. Thus, the process becomes one of defining constraints and working\nwithin these. Selecting a specific hammer (with a particular face, a particular weight, a\nparticular handle etc.) commits the smith to a style of hammering, e.g. once the piece\nhas taken on an acceptable form, then a different hammer (a flat-faced mallet made of\nwood, hide, nylon which will not mark the metal) will be employed for final shaping\nand finishing.\nEach of the hammers in Fig. 5 has a different type of head which results in different\nimpacts on the material being worked and which consequently involves different\nmovements to control the impact forces. UCM suggests that there are efficiency gains\nto be made from identifying the system elements which are most important in the\ncontrol of an action. Defining functional and regulatory parameters allows us to\npostulate which aspects of a system will be controlled. Jewellers ’training, guidebooks,\nweb posts etc. are replete with advice which, on the one hand, collates tacit knowledge\ngained from experience and which, on the other hand, help us to identify constraints\nthat influence their movements and actions.\n7 Creativity in Dynamic Systems\nMuch of the work applying dynamic systems concepts to human behaviour relies on\nthe fact that activity is embodied and involves the performance of physical actions. If\none recognises ‘creativity’as an essential feature of cognitive activity, then this could\n296 C. Baber et al.\nFig. 4 A metal form (source: http://userblogs.ganoksin.com/primitive/2011/01/17/manufacturing-hammered-\nsheet/)\nFig. 5 Examples of jewellers’hammers: (from left) planishing, rawhide, ballpein, chasing, bossing, forging\nbe potentially precluded from dynamic systems accounts. Our aim in the last part of this\npaper is to demonstrate how this preclusion is unwarranted and that it is possible to\nconsider creativity in part of the physical behaviour of the jeweller, as well as any other\nskilled practitioner whose activity is explicable in terms of dynamic system. This relies\non four observations.\nThe first observation builds on the concept of ‘reflective practice (Schön 1983;\nWuytens and Willems 2009). The ‘creative’act is inseparable from the ‘physical’act in\nthat they are intertwined and influence each other (Ingold 2010). The skilled\ncraftworker responds not only to the state of the material as it is being worked but\nalso to the possible future states into which it will transform. There is a sense in which\nthe process of transformation is ‘mechanised’through the use of tools, forms etc. but at\nvarious points in the process, decisions between alternative courses of action remain\npossible. The navigation of these decision points becomes one hallmark of creativity.\nThe second observation, which follows from the first, is that creativity is a cyclical\nresponse to changing situational cues ‘… all creation … has the same foundation:\ngradual steps where a problem leads to a solution that leads to a problem. ’(Ashton\n2015, p. 59). Consider the simple action of filing an edge on a piece of metal (Fig. 6).\nAfter a few strokes, the file is lifted from the piece, filings blown away and the piece\nvisually inspected. The inspection is directed at not only checking whether the edge is\nsmooth but also whether the finish on the metal is acceptable.\nThe first and second observations relate to, and expand, Ihde ’s( 1990)i d e ao fa\nhermeneutic relation between humans and technology. The reflective practice of the\njeweller and the cyclical response to changing situational cues become an essential\nmode of acting upon the materials in order to produce a piece. These observations also\nreflect Ihde’s alterity relations (Ihde 1990). One interpretation of alterity relations could\nbe as a way of envisaging the final piece being worn by the client; at some point during\nits production, the piece ceases to be worked materials and begins to become something\nthat has a life of its own. Jewellers speak of instances in which a piece ‘wanted’to be\nshaped or modified in a certain way, as if instead of jewellers dictating the design, the\npiece began to reveal itself to them. Precisely how this experience of the piece coming\ninto being has not been captured by the methods we have applied in this paper, but it is\na fascinating line for further enquiry.\nThe third observation is that creativity involves a repertoire of responses and abilities\nto interpret and respond to cues and constraints. This carries the assumption of means-\nend problem solving, in that a state in which the system is stable can allow movement\nto other states. It also sees creativity in an opportunistic manner rather than in terms of\nWhat the jeweller ’s hand tells the jeweller ’s brain: tool use,... 297\nFig. 6 Filing a disc of copper\nspecified paths to defined solutions. Expertise becomes a matter of recognising and\nresponding to potential states of the material. Clearly, this reflects Ihde ’s( 1990)\nembodiment relation, and our aim in this paper has been to highlight that this could\nbe usefully described mathematically (through dynamic systems methods such as 1/f\nscaling and uncontrolled manifold hypothesis). We are not arguing that these methods\nreveal the individual’s behaviour (which requires qualitative description and practition-\ner reflection to elucidate) but that such methods can provide a lens on specific aspects\nof skilled behaviour. As such skill develops, so it is possible that the relations between\ntechnology become backgrounded; not in the sense that these background relations are,\nlike a refrigerator the technology is not part of our activity, but that tools or materials\nfade into the background of conscious awareness, while the objective of creating a\nspecific effect or finish is foregrounded. As we have argued, jewellery making is a\nmatter of recognising and responding to constraints.\nThe fourth observation is that the existence of constraints is in no way inimical to\ncreativity. Indeed, any skilled activity depends upon the existence of some constraints\n(Csikszentmihalyi1997;M a r q u ce ta l .2011), and human performance generally suffers\nin the face of too many options. In jewellery making, constraints are imposed by the\nmaterials being used, the tools, the design brief, aesthetic considerations, historical\nconsiderations and so on. These constraints leave many degrees of freedom uncon-\ntrolled and so hardly determine the final product. Yet without them, a jeweller could\nnever get started. Contrast making a ring with turning on a light switch. In the case of\nthe light switch, the possible actions are so constrained that only one outcome is\npossible. This leaves no room for creativity. This is echoed in recent work on jazz\npianists by Walton et al. ( 2015). They found that pairs of jazz pianists considered their\nplaying to be more creative when they co-improvised along with drone tracks as\ncompared to standard swing tracks. Listeners to recordings of these performances\nagreed. In both cases, the pianists were constrained by their training, aesthetic consid-\nerations, the history of jazz and one another, among other things; however, in the case\nof the swing track, they were also constrained by a time signature and the chord\nsequence, not to mention prior recorded improvisations over that chord structure. These\nadditional constraints reduced the players and listeners judgements of the creativity of\nthe performance. The moral here is that some constraints are necessary for creativity,\nbut not so many that few degrees of freedom are left uncontrolled. It would also appear\nthat skill in the use of particular tools for working particular materials solves additional\ndegrees of freedom (through the definition of posture, force and other parameters),\nallowing the attention of the jeweller to focus on a smaller set. In this respect, knowing\nhow to work materials and knowing the effects of particular approaches to such\nworking practices are inseparable from the capability to create new forms and effects\nin these materials.\n8 Discussion\nIn this paper, we have presented jewellery making as an example of creative practice and,\nthrough this, asked how it is possible that the processional aspects of using tools can result\nin ‘creative’output. The examples provided illust rate how the arrangement of compo-\nnents, the nature of the metal or stones being worked, the practice associated with using\n298 C. Baber et al.\nspecific tools all serve to constrain the conce ptual space in which the jeweller operates.\nConsequently, changes to the materials being worked would create new problems to solve.\nIf the solutions are successful then this leads to the identif ication of new possibilities and\nnew practices; if the solutions fail, then this w ould close off these options (at least, until\nanother practitioner offers an alternative approach to solving the problem or a new tool or\nmaterial becomes available). This echoes the notion of‘craft’that Dormer (1997)o f f e r e d ,\nas ‘… knowledge that empowers a maker to take charge of technology.’ [p. 140]: for us,\n‘technology’is that mix of tools, materials, work practice etc. In a sense, this creates the\n‘presence’of which Noë (2012) speaks. As one becomes more proficient at wielding tools\nor at working stones and metals, so the range of possible choices expands. ‘…[I]t is not\nsimply that the craft worker has ‘superior’manipulative skills than other people, nor that\nthey are just ‘better’at using their hands than other people, but rather that the craft worker\nhas a different view of the world and the artefacts it contains.’[Baber2003,p .5 2 ] .T h a ti s ,\ncreativity and creative practice not only change the artefacts that are being worked by also\nthe practitioner (Fry 2012). Critical to this notion is the recognition that there will be\ndecision points at which the path of development of a given design could be altered. The\naction would, one hopes, be under the control of the jeweller but there is ample oppor-\ntunity for action to arise due to physical forces, e.g. metal being heated too much, metal\nbeing hammered too thin, stones cut at the wrong angle or breaking etc. In these cases, the\nstate of the material is as likely to be undesirab le or (for the design at least) catastrophic.\nSo, the creative jeweller is an embodied par ticipant in a system of activity in which the\ninteractions between jeweller, materials and tools combine towards the creation of an item\nof jewellery. From this perspe ctive, the actions of the jew eller appear to be adaptive\nresponses to constraints. These co nstraints were described in Baber ( 2003)i nt e r m so f\ndifferent forms of engagement and range from responding to environmental constraints to\nmorphological and motor activity, to perceptual and cognitive response to changes in state\nand to the cultural practices of each workshop which influence choice of material,\nprocesses and designs. This raises the question of when and how the jeweller exercises\ncreativity. We have noted that, while jewellers might spend some time thinking about and\nsketching design ideasbefore committing to production, there is often a blurring between\ndesign and making. Indeed, the act of making p rovides opportunities for design. We feel\nthat the practice of jewellery making is much closer to Boden ’s( 1996) view of creativity\nthan might, at first, appear. Indeed, we claim that the role that Boden assigns to conceptual\nspaces is primarily played by the set of material , aesthetic and historical constraints that\nenable the creative act. These could be played out through the act of sketching out ideas, or\nthe experimentation and re-arrangement of components prior to making, or through the\ndesire to emphasise a feature of a particular stone in the design. In each case, the\n‘conceptual space’is realised in the physical space and there is little need to engage in\nmental simulation when the components are to hand. One might accept that our account\ncould correspond to Boden’s( 1996) notion of P-creativity, in which ‘new’combinations\nare\ncreated for an individual, but that this is still some way from H-creativity, in which\nentirely new objects are crea ted. Jewellery making takes place under numerous con-\nstraints, in terms of the materials used and how they can be worked, in terms of the\nrequirement that the item of jewellery is worn on the body, in terms of the cultural milieu in\nwhich items of jeweller are made (what society might expect from jeweller or what a given\nworkshop or manufacturer might claim as its copyrighted or signature designs). These\nconstraints can define the borders of the conceptual space in which creativity occurs. In\nWhat the jeweller ’s hand tells the jeweller ’s brain: tool use,... 299\nterms of Ihde’s( 1990) postphenomonology, managing this space of constraints involves\nthe ability to engage in hermeneutic relations across several levels, and acting in this space\ninvolves embodiment relations in which tools, equipment and materials become a part of\nthe physical ‘system’(jeweller-technology-material-workplace) which is involved in the\nproduction of jewellery pieces. As each piece develops, so there could be points at which\nthey gain their own ‘personality’and begin to impose constraints on the developing\nproduction process. We offer this as an example of alterity relations (although positioning\nthis in the dynamic process of producing jewellery, possibly as abrupt transitions in this\nprocess, is something which requires further development). Finally, as the jeweller\nbecomes immersed in the interplay between t ools, equipment and materials, there are\ninstances when any combination of these fades from conscious awareness as attention is\ngiven to specific form being made (rather than the specific manner in which this form is\nmade). Thus, our view of creativity is one in w hich human-technology relations create an\ninterplay between the state of the material and the action of the jeweller. In contrast to the\nidea that creativity begins with an end in mind, we argue that it involves the discovery of\nthe end. However, this is not to say that new items cannot be imagined, e.g. on the basis of\nincorporating new or unusual materials into jewellery or in terms of identifying unfamiliar\nparts of the body on which to place jewellery. If the new items become popular and\nfashionable, then this design would redefine the culturally acceptable bounds of concep-\ntual space for further development. In terms of combinations of familiar ideas, the jeweller\nworks with a lexicon of design styles which range from notions of symmetry and balance\nto styles of fixture for stones, to techniques for working materials and to the cultural milieu\nin which jewellery is designed, made and sold. The balance between the unfamiliar\ncombination and the workable solution becomes as much a matter of physical reality as\nconceptual aspiration.\nAcknowledgements Professor Chemero's research was funded by the Charles Phelps Taft Research Center.\n300 C.
