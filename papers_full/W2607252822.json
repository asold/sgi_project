    "abstract": "The resistivity of oil impregnated paper will decrease during its aging process. This paper takes paper resistivity as an assessment index to evaluate the insulation condition of oil impregnated paper in power transformer. The feasibility of this method are discussed in two aspects: reliability and sensitivity. Iterative inversion of paper resistivity was combined with finite element simulation. Both the bisection method and Newton’s method were used as iterative methods. After the analysis and comparison, Newton’s method was selected as the first option of paper resistivity iteration for its faster convergence. In order to consider the spatial distribution characteristic of paper aging and enhance the calculation accuracy, the resistivity calculation is expanded to a multivariate iteration based on Newton’s method, in order to consider the spatial distribution characteristic of paper aging and improve the calculation accuracy. This paper presents an exploratory research on condition assessment of oil impregnated paper insulation, and provides some reference to the security and economy operation of power transformers.",
