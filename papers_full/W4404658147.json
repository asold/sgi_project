  "abstract": "Recommendation systems harness user–item interactions like clicks and reviews to learn their representations. Previous studies improve recommendation accuracy and interpretability by modeling user preferences across various aspects and intents. However, the aspects and intents are inferred directly from user reviews or behavior patterns, suffering from the data noise and the data sparsity problem. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand the reasons behind recommendations due to the challenges of interpreting implicit aspects and intents. To address these constraints, we harness the sentiment analysis capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the conventional recommendation methods. Specifically, inspired by the deep semantic understanding offered by LLMs, we introduce a chain-based prompting strategy to uncover semantic aspect-aware interactions, which provide clearer insights into user behaviors at a fine-grained semantic level. To incorporate the rich interactions of various aspects, we propose the simple yet effective Semantic Aspect-Based Graph Convolution Network (SAGCN). By performing graph convolutions on multiple semantic aspect graphs, SAGCN efficiently combines embeddings across multiple semantic aspects for final user and item representations. The effectiveness of the SAGCN was evaluated on four publicly available datasets through extensive experiments, which revealed that it outperforms all other competitors. Furthermore, interpretability analysis experiments were conducted to demonstrate the interpretability of incorporating semantic aspects into the model.",
