    "abstract": "The object of the study is a superconducting film magnetic flux transformer comprising two square shaped loops with the tapering active strips and a magnetosensitive film element between them. It is shown that splitting of the active strips into parallel micro- and nanosized superconducting branches and slits increases the gain factor of the transformer, i. e., the concentration of an external magnetic field on the magnetosensitive element, by a factor of more than four.",
