    "abstract": "In this paper, the effect of mutual inductance (M ) and its optimization on the output pulse rise time in Tesla coils is investigated.A numerical method is proposed to calculate the mutual inductance in a Tesla coil.The method is verified by performing some experiments.Eventually, the conditions for maximum voltage gain for ordinary Tesla coil and autotransformer connected one are surveyed.",
