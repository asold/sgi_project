    "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> The growing complexity and frequency of cybersecurity threats require innovative approaches to enhance Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) frameworks. Evaluating the quality of cybersecurity advice generated by ChatGPT and Google Gemini introduces a novel method to harness artificial intelligence for more effective threat mitigation and regulatory compliance. The study reveals that ChatGPT generally outperforms Google Gemini across metrics such as relevance, accuracy, completeness, and contextual appropriateness. Detailed comparative analysis, statistical evaluation, and case studies demonstrate the superior performance of ChatGPT, while also highlighting areas for improvement in both models. The findings emphasize the potential benefits of integrating LLMs into GRC frameworks, provided that their use is complemented with human expertise to address nuanced challenges. This research offers valuable insights into the practical application of AI in cybersecurity, suggesting strategic directions for future advancements.",
