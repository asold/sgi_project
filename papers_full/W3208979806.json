The relevance of the study increases \ndramatically due to the fact that in the context of the spread of \ncoronavirus and the real risk of infection growing with it, almost all \neducational institutions are switching to distance learning mode. The \nkey figure in solving this problem is the qualification of the teacher \nand their education, the level of which greatly influences the \neffectiveness of the entire process of distance and mixed learnin g. The \npurpose of the study was to investigate information technologies and \ndigital tools that could be used in educational institutions in the \ncontext of distance and mixed learning. As a result of the study, the \nauthors were able to analyse world practic e of using technologies and \ninformation resources for distance and mixed forms of learning. \nSystematic use of educational technologies and digital tools and tools \nin the implementation of curricula for training students in distance \nand mixed learning, with  such video communication systems as \nGoogle Hangouts Meet, Webex and Zoom for the organisation of \nlectures and Google Classroom for practical classes, allow organising \nthe educational process in accordance with modern requirements of \n         734 \nteaching in higher edu cation institutions both remotely and in a \nmixed form in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of \nEducation and Science of Ukraine and its recommendations. \n \nKeywords---conference, educational process, information \ntechnologies, student, teacher. \n \n \nIntroduction  \n \nThe introduction of distance education began in Ukraine in recent decades, but \ndid not gain wide popularity and importance, because conventional education was \nthe best option for applicants for higher education. However, as in any process, \nthere is always a developmental stimulator. In this case, such an incentive, and \nunfortunately a negative one, was the global COVID -19 epidemic. Due to the \nspread of the COVID-19 epidemic on March 11, 2020, the Cabinet of Ministers of \nUkraine has decided to introduce quar antine for all types of educational \ninstitutions. Pursuant to the Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. \n211 \"On Preventing the Spread of Acute Respiratory Disease COVID-19 Caused by \nthe SARS -CoV-2 Coronavirus on the Territory of Ukraine\" No (2020), all higher \neducation institutions switched to distance learning mode on March 12, 2020.  \nOver time, in some regions, the epidemiological situation allowed for the \neducational process both remotely and in a mixed form.  But the most important \ntask has been the problem of professional application of technologies and \ninformation digital tools and means for organising the educational process  \n(Lyakhova et al., 2020; Makarenya et al., 2020).  \n \nThe solution to the problem of widespread use of technologies and digital tools of \ndistance and mixed learning in Ukrainian practice depends on solving the \nproblem of readiness of distance learning teachers. The problem of the study is \ncomplex and multidimen sional. It comprises a number of tasks, such as \nidentifying the psychological and pedagogical, and theoretical and methodological \nfoundations of the system of preparation for distance learning; substantiation of \nthe concept of designing the technology of t raining teachers (lecturers) of higher \neducational institutions for distance learning; determination of specific features of \nactivities and developing a multi -faceted feature of a distance education teacher \nas a subject of the educational process; developm ent of the content of this \ntraining and creation of a methodological complex for effective implementation of \nthis content in training and methodological manuals and recommendations, as \nwell as curricula; development and experimental verification of the tec hnology of \npreparing teachers for work in distance learning systems; criteria identification \nfor teachers' readiness to work in distance learning, training, research and  its \nexperimental verification  (Golitsyna, 2017; Igor et al., 2015) . This study \nscrutinises the specific features of information and digital technologies for the \nstage of technology for preparing university teachers for distance education. But \ndespite the obvious importance of teachers' readiness for distance le arning, the \nanalysis of information technologies and digital means and tools of distance \nlearning constitutes a critical task. Notably, distance learning provides the \nfollowing advantages (Table 1). \n \n \n \n735 \nTable 1 \n Distance learning advantages \n \nAdvantage Feature \nFlexibility The ability to present the course material taking into account \nstudents' abilities and training. This is achieved by creating \nalternative websites to get more detailed or additional \ninformation on unclear topics, as well as a number of  hinting \nquestions, etc. \nRelevance The possibility of introducing the latest pedagogical, \npsychological, and methodological developments. \nConvenience The ability to study at a convenient time, in a certain place, get \nan education on -the-job, no time limits for mastering the \nmaterial. \nModularity Breakdown of the material into separate functionally complete \ntopics that are studied as they are learned and correspond to the \nabilities of an individual student or group in general. \nEconomic \nefficiency \nThe teaching method is cheaper than conventional ones due to \nthe efficient use of training facilities, easier adjustment of e -\nlearning materials and multi-access to them. \nScalability The ability to simultaneously use a large amount of educational \ninformation by any number of students. \nInteractivity Active communication between students of the group and the \nteacher, which considerably increases motivation to learn, \nimproves the assimilation of the material. Greater opportunities \nto control the quality of train ing, which include discussions, \nchats, the use of self -control, and the absence of psychological \nbarriers. Lack of geographical boundaries for obtaining an \neducation. Different courses can be studied in different \neducational institutions around the world. \n \nAmong the scientists involved in the development of research -to-practice \napproaches to the development of the use of information technology and digital \ntools in distance education and mixed learning process es, it is worth mentioning \nPopova et al. (2020); Rasheed et al.  (2020); Thistoll & Yates (2016); Gavrilova & \nKatasonova (2017); Olenets (2018), and others. When considering information \ntechnologies and digital tools, the authors of the study mean particular platforms \nand tools (Webex, Zoom, Google Hangouts Meet, Google Classroom, Skype, Google \nSuite/Docs). These pieces of software and digital inf ormation resources allow \nteachers to communicate with students, check their tasks, monitor attendance, \norganiSe semester control, certification, and other educational processes in a \ndistance learning environment. Such technologies, depending on the country , \nuniversity, and discipline studied, can be integrated at any stage of the training \ncourse. The teacher's initiative to introduce such technologies, students' \nwillingness to use them, and the technical ability of both sides to apply these \ntechnologies are important here (Mora et al., 2015; Lluch, 2011).  \n \nThe purpose of the study was to investigate information technologies and digital \ntools that could be used in higher educational institutions in the context of \ndistance and mixed learning. To achieve this purpose, it is necessary to solve the \n         736 \nfollowing task s: to analyse the feedback of university students on the use of \ndistance learning technologies; to determine the attitude of students towards the \neducational process on the Internet; to find out the positive aspects and problems \nof using digital technologi es at the university; to make recommendations for \nimproving distance education (Premkumar & Roberts, 1999; White et al., 2005). \n \nLiterature Review \n \nBefore directly analysing the technology and digital tools of distance learning and \nmixed learning in educational institutions, and first of all higher education \ninstitutions, it is worth considering how Ukrainian practices and practices from \nother countries approach this issue. The digitalisation of world economic \nprocesses has had a great impact on the digitalisation of higher education (Popova \net al., 2020). The idea of developing this area of educational activity is supported \nby many researchers who contemplate the possibility of expanding rou nd-the-\nclock learning technologies for the digital generation, thereby increasing the \ncompetitiveness of the university. The study presents a critical review of the \nliterature that covers the essence and areas of digital technology management \nand the basic s of consumer behaviour of digital users  (Figlio, 1997; Zeichner, \n2005; Hanushek & Rivkin, 2006).  \n \nThe scientific study indicates that the spread of coronavirus infection (Makarenya, \n2020) served as the impetus for the transi tion of education to the era of \ndigitalisation not partially, but completely and without exceptions. This paper \ndescribes the positive effects of this transition, which many scientists have \nnoticed. This study also discusses distance learning methods and d escribes the \nmost effective methods, such as business play, in more detail. The authors \nhighlight the importance of focusing on personalising learning, which is possible \nin a digital educational environment. The study Khanna ( 2016), describes the \nstructure of the good governance architecture, which will considerably improve \nthe overall performance of distance learning institutions on a well -structured and \nsystematic basis. The structure of good governance comprises seven basic \nprinciples, namely: effectiveness, transparency, accountability, participation, \nleadership, consensus orientation, and equity. The developed system will provide \na significant improvement in educational and methodological activities, as well as \nthe quality of distance learning (Roach, 2014; Markova et al., 2021; Leshchynska \net al., 2021). \n \nThe study Rasheed et al. (2020), notes that mixed learning involves a combination \nof face -to-face and online components that are carefully intertwined to \ncomplement each other. The study aims to explore the challenges that students \nand teachers face upon using technology and information tools in a mixed \nlearning environment. The conclusion suggests recommendation s that an \neducational institution should adopt when providing appropriate technology for \nmixed and distance learning by determining the overall level of technological skill \nand competence of its teachers and students. In the study  Wen et al. (2019), a \ncognitive learning model was developed to optimise the uncertainties and \ncomplexities that are inherent in distance learning. The proposed model takes \ninto account the learning motivation of higher education applicants, the \nrequirements for the learning task and the speed of changing cognitive rules, and \n \n \n737 \ntransforms the learning process in distance learning into a multi -purpose \noptimisation problem.  \n \nThe article Thistoll & Yates ( 2016), presents a simp le model of student \nengagement that reflects the triality between the student, the educational \ninstitution, and the external environment. When testing the study, both \nemployees and students recognised the distance learning system as relevant and \nup-to-date. Research was carried out in a similar area in the studies  (Al-Rahmi et \nal., 2018; da Costa  et al. , 2018) . The study  Gavrilova & Katasonova ( 2017), \nconsiders theoretical aspects of the development of distance education in Ukraine, \nin particular its conceptual framework. The analysis of scientific sources was \ncarried out, which made it possible to systematise the key concepts and features \nof distance learning. The article examines how the basic concepts of distance \nlearning were defined historically. The author compares the concepts of \"distance \neducation\" and \"distance learning\". The study Yandell ( 2020), investigates the  \neducational processes in distance form in England, especially when learning \nEnglish. \n \nThe article Lyakhova (2020), notes that the preparation and conduct of online \nlectures and seminars involves not only digitising materials for study and \nselecting appropriate information support, but also reviewing approaches to their \nimplementation. It is important to engage and activate students in order to get the \ngreatest effect and assimilation of the presented material. That is why the purpose \nof the study was to explore the possibilities of using cloud services to support \nattention and receive feedback from lecture listeners when conducting lectures on \nthe Internet. To achieve the research goal, the main method of the study was an \nexpert survey. It was found that online lectures are accompanied by a loss of \nconcentration and attention in students under the influence of various factors. \nTherefore, this study used an approach where applicants were engaged in \ninteractive participation durin g an online lecture in three stages, moving from \nteaching lecture material to online activity using prepared interactive materials in \nonline services. This allowed retaining the attention of the lecture audience, \nswitching it between the phases of presenta tion of the material and activities in \nthe process of group and individual interaction. \n \nThe article Sakulina (2018), analyses distance learning methods. Combined with \nthe latest information technologies, the distance learning  system allows \nimplementing an individual approach to learning and achieve high results due to \nthe optimal selection of the content of the training course, as well as teaching \nmethods and tools. In this study, distance learning was considered as an \nalternative to other types of education: full -time, part-time, or evening training at \na university; self -education using educational literature and Internet resources. \nThe article Netanda (2017), covers the development of the distanc e education \nsystem in South Africa. The study reveals the problems faced by the government \nof the country in achieving progressive results in the country's education. When \nstudents study the material using remote platforms, it is also possible to perform \nindependent work (Havrylyshyn et al., 2019) . The article presents the procedure \nfor performing independent work by students of higher educational institutions. \nThus, based on the literature review, it can be concluded that distance and mixed \nforms of learning are becoming increasingly important in educational processes, \n         738 \nand the study of information and digital learning tools requires increasingly more \nattention from the academia. \n \nMaterials and Methods \n \nThe methodological basis of this study includes the main ideas of system, \ntechnological, and process approaches. To solve the tasks at hand, the study used \nthe developments from scientific, pedagogical, and methodological literature, \nUkrainian and international practices in preparing teachers for distance learning, \nthat is, their study of technologies  and information tools for distance and mixed \nlearning in higher education institutions, as well as theoretical (identification of \ncontradictions of this problem, analysis, synthesis, comparison, etc.) and \nempirical (observation, survey, testing, monitorin g, etc.) research methods; \ndiagnostic-forming experiment, statistical processing of its results. Distance \nlearning technologies are closely related to the most common teaching methods. \nIn the aspect of considering distance learning, there are the following  methods: \nillustrative, reproductive, problem presentation, research, and heuristic. Figure 1 \ndemonstrates these methods in detail. \n \n \nFigure 1. Training methods \n \nThe most popular information and digital means of carrying out distance le arning \ninclude means that are included in groups of teleconferences, video conferences, \nas well as the use of the e -mail service. Teleconference constitutes a network \nservice that allows organising a joint discussion of thousands of users of a global \nTraining methods \nIllustrative \nmethod \nallows students to gain knowledge at lectures, on \neducational and methodical literature, through an on -screen \nmanual in a computer version. By perceiving and \nunderstanding the facts, students' conclusions remain within \nthe framework of reproducing thinking. \nReproductive \nmethod \npromotes students' understanding of educational material \naccording to rules similar to the samples or situations presented. \n \nProblem \npresentation \nmethod \nused with various sources and tools. Before presenting the \nmaterial, the teacher formulates a cognitive task, and then, \ncomparing opinions and different approaches, demonstrates a \nway to solve the problem. In this method, students take part in \nscientific research. \n \nResearch method \nused after analysing the educational material, setting tasks, and \ngiving an oral or written briefing to the teacher. This method \nallows students to independently study literature, sources, and \nperform search activities. \n \nHeuristic method \nhelps solve the tasks set either under the guidance of the teacher, \nor by the students themselves based on working with electronic \nmanuals and educational and methodological literature. \n \n \n \n739 \ncomputer network, and which can be presented in the form of a large bulletin \nboard. The essence of the teleconference boils down to the fact that the user \nreceives articles from other participants, and can send their notes to other \nparticipants. A video conference is a communication session between two or more \nusers of the network, both corporate and global, who can be at a fairly large \ndistance from each other, and not only hear, but also see each other. Typically, \nvideo conferences allow broadcasting desktop i mages, enabling the conference \nparticipants to work together. E -mail is a technology and service for sending and \ndelivering electronic messages to computer network users. A more detailed \ndescription of possible information and digital resources for conduct ing various \ntypes of classes in remote form is presented in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 \n Use of information and digital resources in accordance with the forms of distance \nlearning classes  \n \nForms of distance learning Information and digital resources \nElectronic lectures E-mail, Google Drive, Moodle, Zoom, \nWebex, Google Classroom \nOnline seminars Zoom, Webex \nPractical exercises  E-mail, Google Drive, Moodle, Google \nClassroom, Microsoft Office \nTerm papers, projects, calculation and \ngraphic works \nE-mail, Google Drive, Zoom, Google \nHangouts Meet, Microsoft Office \nIndependent work of students E-mail, Google Drive, Moodle, Google \nClassroom, INTERNET \nTest control as a form of intermediate, \nmodular, and final control Moodle, Microsoft Office \nOther forms of final certification \n(exams, credits, state exams, defence of \nqualifying papers) \nZoom, Webex, Google Hangouts Meet, \nSkype \nCommunicators Viber, Telegram, WhatsApp, Imo \n \nEach remote technology has its critical features and aspects of use, and therefore \nit is important, especially when conducting the educational process in quarantine, \nto understand the general mechanisms of using software packages and distance \neducational technologies. This study focuses on educational technologies used in \nthe context of curric ula and institutions that offer complete distance learning \ncourses (Anderson & Rivera-Vargas, 2020). All education in the 21st century is \ndigital, through which the use of networks, the creation of text and images and \ntheir ed iting, as well as the search for information actualise the life of almost \nevery teacher and student. However, the context of distance education – where all \ninteractions are mediated –creates a unique and enhanced context of \ndigitalisation. This study focuses on two issues:  \n \n What aspects were not completely satisfactory in the process of transition \nand transformation that education has undergone, from its more \nconventional concept based on transition to its new configuration, marked \nby the constant use of digital technologies and the environment.  \n         740 \n What future challenges does distance education have to face to support the \nsustainability of this teaching model? \n \nBased on theoretical and interpretive analysis, based on the review of relevant \nstudies and documen ts on distance education, the study identified the objects \nrequiring a critical study in the use of digital technologies in distance education: \nlimitations, shortcomings, and future problems. The authors of Shahmoradi et al. \n(2018), note that success in implementing an e -learning educational system as \none of the main approaches to managing the knowledge and educational needs of \na higher education organisation will not be achieved without identifying various \nskills, technical, and cul tural problems. To solve this problem, it is necessary to \ncreate an information technology infrastructure and standards, use the \nexperience of leading countries in the field of e -learning, create an appropriate \nculture and familiarise students and teachers  with the development and use of e -\nlearning materials. \n \nResults and Discussion \n \nThe main purpose of using information technology and digital tools in a higher \neducation institution should be the acquirement of knowledge, skills, and abilities \nby students a nd applicants, which are necessary for effective interaction with \nmodern computer equipment and new information technologies and digital tools \nin the educational process and future professional activities. Considering the \nfuture specialty of students and applicants for higher education, in the classroom, \nif possible, it is necessary to link terms from information technology and digital \ntools with concepts from their future subject area. The functionality of each of the \nsoftware programmes listed in Table 1 is quite wide, and therefore attention will \nbe paid to the main features that will reveal the main technical possibilities of \nusing some of the information and software resources, namely Google Hangouts \nMeet, Webex and Zoom, Google Classroom and for what f orms of conducting \nclasses in the remote form of the educational process they can be applied. \n \nGoogle Hangouts Meet.

To sta rt a video lecture or webinar, \nthe user must click on the \"Start meeting\" button (Figure 8). After joining, various \nonline meeting management tools become available to the teacher-organiser of the \nmeeting (Figure 9). \n \n\n         744 \n \nFigure 8. Starting a video conference in Webex \n \n \nFigure 9. Online meeting management tools in Webex \nZoom. Zoom combines cloud -based video conferences, simple internet \nconferences, and group chat in platform -based conference rooms  (Stechkevych, \n2020). After registering or logging in, the user must click \"organise a conference\" – \nthe desktop application will automatically load. Alternatively, one can click on the \ndownload link in the footer (Zoom, 2021). To log in, the use r needs to just go to \nthe site and click \"Sign in\". After that, one can log in using their Google, \nFacebook, or existing Zoom account (Figure 10). \n \n \nFigure 10. Log in to zoom with an existing account \n \nIf the user does not have a Zoom account, they have to  click \"Sign Up Free\" to \ncreate a new Zoom account. The personal meeting ID (PMID) is automatically \nassigned to the user as a permanent personal meeting room. The user can run it \nat any time or schedule it for future reference. The user's PMID is part of t he \n\n \n \n745 \npersonal URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the meeting. For example, \nhttps://zoom.us/j/5551112222. If the user is on a paid plan and has a Pro \nlicense, there is an option to set up a 10 -digit PCID, otherwise changes are not \npossible. On working with video meetings:  \n \n To start, the user must click \"Start\" to commence a pre -scheduled \nconference included in the list of upcoming meetings.  \n To edit, or update a scheduled meeting, the user can go to the \"Personal \nMeeting Room\" tab.  \n To delete, the user must cl ick \"Delete\", which removes the scheduled \nmeeting permanently.  \n \nSelect \"Meeting\" to view, start, edit, and delete scheduled meetings, meeting \nrecordings, and the PMID (Figure 11). \n \n \nFigure 11. \"Meeting\" functionality \n \nTo start creating a meeting, the user must click on the system button \"Schedule a \nNew Meeting\". It is also important to understand how the functionality that is \nplaced in the lower panel of the screen works when conducting a video meeting. A \ndetailed description of the features is presented in Table 3. \n \nTable 3 \n Description of the functionality placed at the bottom of the screen during the \nZoom video meeting \n \nFunctionality Description \nMute Turns the microphone on or off. \nStart Video Shows a video from the camera or sets a screen saver from the \nuser's account \nInvite View and manage participants (if the user is an organiser) \nManage \nParticipants \nOpens a window with a list of users. \nShare Screen Allows uploading photos and images for demonstration to \nparticipants, share the screen of the user's computer. \nReaction Allows adding an emotional response to the report. \nMore Element for displaying additional parameters. \n \nTo complete the Zoom video meeting, the user must click \"End Meeting\". The \ncloud-based Google Classroom platform combines useful Google services \norganised specifically for learning. Google Classroom features are presented in \nFigure 12. \n \n\n         746 \n \nFigure 12. Google Classroom features \n \nTo get started in Google Classroom, one needs to log in to corporate mail (Figure \n13). \n \n \nFigure 13. Authorisation in corporate mail \n \nGoogle Classroom is located in Google apps where one can select it for further \nwork. After logging in to the programme, the user will need to select a role (Figure \n14). After opening it, the programme will redirect the user  to Google Classroom, \nwhere they can start creating their own course. Training courses that have been \naccessed by other users will also be found. To create a new Classroom (a \ndiscipline to study in Google Classroom), the user must click on \"+\" in the upper -\nright corner and select the \"Create Classroom\" command. \n \n \nFigure 14. Creating a new course in Google Classroom \n \n \n\n \n \n747 \nWhen creating and organising a course, the main tabs will be available: \"Tasks\", \n\"People\" and \"Grades\" (Figure 15). \n \n \nFigure 15. Working with the \"Tasks\", \"People\", and \"Ratings\" tabs \n \nThe \"Tasks\" tab allows adding training materials to the course and distribute \ntasks by topic and in the required sequence. When creating a \"Task\", the user \nshould follow the system prompts and carefully fill in al l the fields, because the \ninterface is intuitive. In the \"People\" tab, the user will see a list of students who \nhave joined the course. Users who have not yet confirmed the invitation in the \nsystem have a pale icon and are inactive. All authorised users can send individual \nnotifications via corporate mail (the user must click on the icon and select the \n\"Send e-mail to Student\" command). In the \"Grades\" tab, the teacher can check \ntasks, give grades, and comment on answers. Going back to the \"Tasks\" tab, \nstatistics for each type of work are available. In addition, most of the functionality \nis occupied by the student's work, but within the framework of a scientific \npublication on the main technologies of distance learning, this is difficult to \ndescribe in detai l. Table 4 demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of \nusing Google Classroom. \n \nTable 4 \n Advantages and disadvantages of using Google Classroom \n \nAdvantages of Google Classroom Disadvantages of Google Classroom \n Setting up the course to be \ncreated is not difficult. It is \npossible to test students' \nknowledge. \n Free and affordable. There are no \nads in the service. \n One can invite up to 20 teachers \nto conduct a training course. \n Storage of all course materials on \nGoogle Drive, including tasks \ncompleted by students. \n Ability to communicate between \nthe teacher and students, and \nbetween students. Students can \n Google Classroom does not provide \na webinar room, but this problem is \nsolved quite simply. The teacher \ncan use the features of YouTube or \nGoogle Hangouts, which allow \nholding an online meeting with \nstudents. \n There is no electronic journa l \n(student report card) in the open \nversion of the Google Classroom \nservice. This feature is available for \ncorporate users of Google \nClassroom. \n For authors who have personal \n\n         748 \nview tasks, leave their comments, \nand ask questions to the teacher. \n Google Classroom has integration \nwith Google Drive, Google Docs, \nGoogle Calendar, Google  Forms, \nand Gmail. \naccounts, there are restrictions: the \nnumber of course participants is no \nmore than 250 and only 100 people \ncan join the course in one day \n(Kolomiytsev, 2020; Olenets, 2018). \n \nConclusion  \n \nSystematic use of educational technologies and digital tools and tools in the \nimplementation of curricula for training  students in distance and mixed learning, \nwith such video communication systems as Google Hangouts Meet, Webex and \nZoom for the organisation of lectures and Google Classroom for practical classes, \nallow organising the educational process in accordance with  modern \nrequirements of teaching in higher education institutions both remotely and in a \nmixed form in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Education and \nScience of Ukraine and its recommendations. Furthermore, these processes will \ncontribute to the development and maintenance of an appropriate level of \ncompetence of both the teaching staff of higher educational institutions and \nfuture specialists in the context of complex educational processes, both in the \nconditions of quarantine restrictio ns at the moment and in the aspect of \nintroducing full-fledged distance courses in the future. \n \nThe use of distance learning and digital technologies allows reducing the cost of \ntraining (no need for renting expenses, travelling to the place of study, for both \nstudents and teachers, etc.); conducting training for a large number of people; \nimproving the quality of training through the use of modern tools, large electronic \nlibraries, etc.; creating a single educational environment (especially important for \ncorporate training). Further development of the study is seen in scientific \npublications on the use of individual digital distance learning tools for teaching \nindividual disciplines, because each of them may have specific teaching features \nthat should be addressed. \n \nReferences \n \nAl-Rahmi, W.
