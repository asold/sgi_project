  "abstract": "Background: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in various health-related fields. However, many healthcare studies have raised concerns about the reliability and biases of LLMs in healthcare applications. Methods: To explore the practical application of multimodal LLMs in skin disease identification, and to evaluate sex and age biases, we tested the performance of 2 popular multimodal LLMs, ChatGPT-4 and LLaVA-1.6, across diverse sex and age groups using a subset of a large dermatoscopic dataset containing around 10,000 images and 3 skin diseases (melanoma, melanocytic nevi, and benign keratosis-like lesions). Results: In comparison to 3 deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet50, and Model Derm) based on convolutional neural network (CNN), one vision transformer model (Swin-B), we found that ChatGPT-4 and LLaVA-1.6 demonstrated overall accuracies that were 3% and 23% higher (and F1-scores that were 4% and 34% higher), respectively, than the best performing CNN-based baseline while maintaining accuracies that were 38% and 26% lower (and F1-scores that were 38% and 19% lower), respectively, than Swin-B. Meanwhile, ChatGPT-4 is generally unbiased in identifying these skin diseases across sex and age groups, while LLaVA-1.6 is generally unbiased across age groups, in contrast to Swin-B, which is biased in identifying melanocytic nevi. Conclusions: This study suggests the usefulness and fairness of LLMs in dermatological applications, aiding physicians and practitioners with diagnostic recommendations and patient screening. To further verify and evaluate the reliability and fairness of LLMs in healthcare, experiments using larger and more diverse datasets need to be performed in the future.",
