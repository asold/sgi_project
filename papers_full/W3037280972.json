INTRODUCTION\nDistortion of current in the power network causes the needed\nfor control of the level of higher harmonics to ensure\nrequired power quality [1]–[3]. Mainly used inductive current\ntransformers (CT) are able to provide wideband operation\nwith their accuracy class determined for sinusoidal current\nof frequency 50 Hz [4]–[9]. Therefore, the measurement\nerror of non-sinusoidal electrical power and energy is not\nincreased [10]. However, due to the nonlinearity of their\nmagnetic core several issues must be considered during\ndetermination of their accuracy of transformation of higher\nharmonics. The rms values of generated higher harmonics,\nas well as magnetic permeability and losses in the magnetic\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Zhigang Liu\n.\ncore are dependent from the magnetic ﬂux density. Its value\nin the magnetic core results from the rms value of primary\ncurrent and load of the secondary winding as well as the rms\nvalues of higher harmonics in the primary current. Therefore,\nthe highest wideband accuracy is provided if the rms values of\nthe self-generated higher harmonics for required load of the\nsecondary winding and rms value of the primary currents as\nwell as its distortion are negligible. All mentioned external\nfactors conditioning the rms values of the self-generated\nhigher harmonics by the inductive CT into the secondary\ncurrent must be considered to ensure effective compensation.\nNone of the methods proposed in the papers [11]–[15] pro-\nvides this. The nonlinear mathematical models can be used\nto compensate the measured value [16]. Unfortunately the\ncost of the numerical computations is not speciﬁed.

In the case of\ninductive voltage transformer it should be noticed that the\nfundamental component is considerably larger than all other\nharmonics. Therefore they inﬂuence on magnetic ﬂux density\nin the magnetic core may be assumed to be negligible [23].\nThe novelty of the paper concerns analysis of the depen-\ndence of the peak value of the magnetic ﬂux density in the\nmagnetic core from the rms values and the phase angles of the\nhigher harmonics in the primary current. Their inﬂuence on\ntransformation accuracy of the distorted current is explained\nand considered. The lowest and the highest values of the\nmagnetic ﬂux density in the magnetic core of tested CT\ncaused by the primary current’s higher harmonics for its max-\nimum distortion deﬁned in the standard IEC 61000-3-12 are\nconsidered [24]. Simultaneously, its impact on the secondary\ncurrent distortion caused by the nonlinearity of the mag-\nnetic core is investigated. Presented solutions and methods\nin papers [5]–[15], [23], [25]–[29] do not cover these issues.\nTherefore, in the evaluation of the transformation accuracy of\nthe low order higher harmonic it is required to consider their\ndifferent phase angle in relation to the main harmonic of the\ndistorted primary current. Moreover, the possible increase of\nthe self-generated higher harmonics into the CT’s secondary\ncurrent must be considered. Proposed evaluation procedure of\nthe inductive CTs wideband accuracy enables determination\nof the maximum values of current and phase errors of trans-\nformation of the higher harmonics with consideration of men-\ntioned nonlinear effects. Therefore, it is the same approach as\nused in the standards IEEE\\IEC to deﬁne accuracy class for\ntransformation of sinusoidal current [30], [31].\nII. THE MEASURNING CIRCUIT AND THE OBJECT\nOF THE RESEARCH\nThe object of the research are two inductive CTs, the 50 Hz\ntype unit designed for transformation of sinusoidal current\nand the wideband unit, both with current ratio equal to\n5 A \\5 A and rated secondary winding apparent power equal\nto 10 V A. However, during the tests resistive loads are used\nnot to additionally increase the secondary voltage and the\nmagnetic ﬂux density for transformation of the higher har-\nmonics of the distorted primary current. Selected objects of\nthe research have the primary and the secondary currents\nratio equal to 1 in order not to require reference current\ntransformer, as it could be expected to affect the results of the\nresearch [32]. In the measuring circuit presented in Fig.1 the\ndifferential connection is made in accordance with the stan-\ndard IEC 61869-2 [30]. However, it is used to determine the\ncomposite error of the protective CTs. The same method may\nbe applied to the measuring CTs. The 1 current shunt is\nused to measure the differential current in the connection\nmade between the primary and the secondary circuits of\nthe tested CT. The digital power meter with DFT enables\ndetermination of the rms values and the phase angles of its\nhigher harmonics.\nFIGURE 1. The measuring circuit to determine the values of current and\nphase errors at harmonics and waveforms of the excitation current and\nthe secondary voltage of tested inductive CT.\nIn Figure 1 the following notations are used: IT - insulation\ntransformer, PPS - programmable power source, TCT - tested\ncurrent transformer, DPM - digital power meter, RD - 1 \ncurrent shunt for measurements of the differential current,\nRS - 0.1  current shunt for measurements of the primary\ncurrent, RL - load resistor of tested CT’s secondary winding,\nosc – oscilloscope, i 0\\1\\2 - instantaneous value of the excita-\ntion \\primary \\secondary current.\nThe measuring circuit is supplied by the programmable\npower voltage source through the insulating transformer [33].\nIf required for testes rms value of the primary current exceeds\n20 A application of the inductive high current testing trans-\nformer for supplying of the measuring circuit with distorted\ncurrent is required [34]. The oscilloscope is used to determine\nthe waveforms of the excitation current measured by the R D\nresistor and the secondary voltage measured by the differ-\nential connection of two voltage probes. The digital power\nmeter is used to measure simultaneously the voltages from\nRD(1 ) and R S (0.1 ) current shunts. The rms value of\nthe hk harmonic of the primary current of the tested CT is\ndetermined from the formula:\nI1hk =10 ·URShk (1)\nURShk - the rms value of the hk harmonic of voltage from R S\ncurrent shunt.\nThe percentage value of the hk harmonic of the composite\nerror in relation to its rms value in distorted primary current\nis determined from the equation:\nε%Ihk =URDhk\nI1hk\n·100% (2)\nURDhk - the rms value of the hk harmonic of voltage of 1 \ncurrent shunt.\n118886 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM.

Their inductance\nis below 0.08 µH. Therefore, calculated from equations (6)\nand (7) measurement errors of 50 Hz frequency main com-\nponent of distorted current and its phase caused by cur-\nrent shunts are equal to respectively: ±1% \\±0.02 ◦ and\n±0.01% \\±0.01◦.\n1URhk =1URDC +Zhk −R\nR ·100% (6)\nδRhk =tan−1\n(2 ·π·fhk ·L\nR\n)\n(7)\n1URDC −the DC tolerance of used current shunt, Z hk –\nthe impedance of current shunt for higher harmonic of hk\nfrequency, fhk– 5 kHz as the limiting frequency of the mea-\nsurements, R - the value of the DC resistance of current shunt\nequal to R S or R D, L - the value of the inductance of the\ncurrent shunts equal to 0.08 µH.\nIn accordance with equation (6) and (7) the uncertainty\nof measurements caused by used current shunts at given\nfrequencies (rms value\\phase angle) is equal to:\n→ 1 from 50 Hz to 5 kHz: ±0.02%\\±0.02◦\n→ 0.1  50 Hz: ±1.00%\\±0.015◦; 5 kHz: ±1.05%\n\\±1.5◦\nAccuracy of measurement of the rms value and the value of\nthe phase angle of harmonics of voltage by used digital power\nmeter provided by manufacturer:\n→ 50 Hz: ±0.2%\\±0.2◦; 5 kHz: ±0.75% \\±1.5◦\nThe combined uncertainties of determination of the values of\ncurrent and phase errors at harmonics by developed measur-\ning system resulting from the accuracy of used current shunts\nand digital power meter are equal to (current error\\phase\nerror):\n→ 50 Hz: ±0.01%\\±0.01◦\n→ 5 kHz: ±0.05% \\±0.02◦\nThese are maximum values determined for the uniform distri-\nbution of the standard uncertainties with the coverage factor\n2 and the level of conﬁdence of about 95%.

The\nstandard uncertainty type A is negligible since it is signiﬁ-\ncantly lower than 0.1 of uncertainty type B, as results from\naveraging from 256 series of measurements.\nIII. DEPENDENCE OF THE PEAK VALUE OF THE\nMAGNETIC FLUX DENSITY IN THE MAGNETIC\nCORE FROM PRIMARY CURRENT HARMONICS\nThis paragraph contains analysis of the inﬂuence of the rms\nvalues and the phase angles of the higher harmonics of the\ndistorted primary current on instantaneous values of the mag-\nnetic ﬂux density obtained in the magnetic core of the tested\nCT in accordance with equation:\nB(t) = 1\nz2 ·sFe\n·\n∫\n[ucore ·dt] (8)\nB(t) - instantaneous value of the magnetic ﬂux density; z 2 –\nnumbers of turns of the secondary winding; s Fe - cross-section\nof the magnetic core, u core - instantaneous value of the voltage\nof the magnetic core.\nucore =u2 +R2i2 (9)\nDuring the measurements presented in the paper curves of\nthe instantaneous value of the excitation current and the\nsecondary voltage were determined with the oscilloscope.\nThe samples were collected to the ﬁle to perform the needed\nintegration of the secondary voltage. The resistance of the\nsecondary winding is equal to 0.101 . The value of the\nleakage inductance of the evenly winded in the single layer\nsecondary winding on the toroidal core is negligible.\nThe tests of the impact of the primary current harmonics on\nthe peak value of the magnetic ﬂux density in the magnetic\ncore were performed for three cases. The maximum (B max)\nand the minimum (B min) peak values were achieved and for\nthe case when the distorted supply voltage of the primary\nwinding was composed of the main frequency harmonic and\nthe one higher harmonic. In order to obtain the B max and the\nBmin conditions the percentage values of voltage harmonics\nfor phase angles from 0 ◦ to 360 ◦ in relation to the main\nharmonic were change in a range from 0 to the values permis-\nsible by the standard IEC 61000-3-12 in the power network\nfor the highest total harmonic distortion of the current equal\nVOLUME 8, 2020 118887\nM.

The cases Bmax and Bmin percentage values (and phases) of the\nharmonics of the secondary voltage and the rms values (and phases) of\nthe harmonics of the magnetic flux density in the magnetic core.\nto 47% [24]. In the case B max the distorted primary current\nsupplied to tested inductive CTs is composed of the primary\ncomponent of frequency equal to 50 Hz and all higher har-\nmonics of order from 2nd to 13th. The percentage values of\nobtained higher harmonics of CT’s secondary voltage (Fig.1)\nare presented in Table 1 as percentages of rms value of its\nmain component.\nU2h1 – the rms value of the main component of the distorted\nsecondary voltage, FFT(B) – the results of the Fast Fourier\nTransformation obtained for the instantaneous values of the\nmagnetic ﬂux density.\nThe rms value of the main component of the distorted\nprimary current is equal to 5 A as the rms value of the rated\nsinusoidal current. The rms value of the main harmonic of the\nmagnetic ﬂux density obtained for the rated primary current\nof the tested CT is equal to 0.346 T as obtained for trans-\nformation of sinusoidal current. Constant component equal\nto 0.022 T in the waveform of the distorted magnetic ﬂux\ndensity is caused by presents of the even higher harmonics in\nthe distorted primary current.\nIn Fig.2 obtained from the measuring circuit presented\nin Fig.1 waveforms of the secondary voltage (u 2 dist.) and\nthe magnetic ﬂux density (B(t) dist) are compared with the\nwaveforms of the secondary voltage (u 50Hz) and the mag-\nnetic ﬂux density (B(t) 50Hz) for sinusoidal primary current.\nThe instantaneous value of the voltage of the magnetic core\n(ucore) is computed from equation (9) for distorted secondary\nvoltage.\nThe peak value of distorted secondary voltage equal to\n0.81 V is higher than sinusoidal equal to 0.7 V due to the addi-\ntional higher harmonics. Moreover, waveform of distorted\nFIGURE 2. Waveforms for the case Bmax.\nFIGURE 3. Waveforms for the case Bmin.\nsecondary voltage is close in shape to rectangular. These\nconditions causes increase of the peak value of magnetic\nﬂux density in relation to sinusoidal secondary voltage from\n0.35 T to 0.46 T. Presence of the even harmonics in distorted\nsecondary voltage causes that the waveform of the magnetic\nﬂux density becomes asymmetrically displaced towards pos-\nitive values. In condition when the rms value of distorted\nprimary current is equal to the rms value of the sinusoidal\nprimary current 5 A the value of peak magnetic ﬂux density\nis equal to 0.40 T.\nIn the case B min the distorted primary current of tested\ninductive CTs is composed of primary component of fre-\nquency equal to 50 Hz and the odd higher harmonics of\norder from 3rd to 13th. To achieve the minimum peak value\nof the magnetic ﬂux density in the magnetic core (B max) in\nrelation to sinusoidal primary current the phase angles of\nodd harmonic in relation to the main harmonic of distorted\nsecondary voltage are equal to 180 ◦.\nThe minimum value of the magnetic ﬂux density in the\ncase Bmin is equal to 0.28 T and it is lower than obtained for\nthe sinusoidal primary current (0.35 T). The peak value of\nthe distorted secondary voltage is higher than the sinusoidal\nsecondary voltage but the peak value of the magnetic ﬂux\ndensity results from the phase angles of the odd harmonic\nin relation to the main harmonic of the distorted secondary\nvoltage that are equal to 180 ◦.\nIn Fig.4 the waveforms are presented for the case when the\ndistorted primary current is composed of the main frequency\nharmonic and 11 th higher harmonic equal to 10% of its value.\n118888 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM.

Waveforms for the case when distorted primary current is\ncomposed of main frequency harmonic and 11th higher harmonic.\nFIGURE 5. The flowchart of the influence of higher harmonics on\ntransformation accuracy of distorted current by inductive CT.\nIn this case the increase of the peak value of the magnetic\nﬂux density caused by higher harmonic equal to 10% of\nthe main harmonic of distorted primary current is equal to\n0.003 T. The value of its main component is equal to 0.346 T\nand the value of the 3 rd harmonic is equal to 0.005 T (this\ncomponent is caused by distortion of the primary current by\nthe nonlinearity of the magnetic core). Further increase of the\nfrequency of higher harmonic in distorted primary current\ncauses decrease of its inﬂuence on obtained magnetic ﬂux\ndensity in the magnetic core.\nIV. FLOWCHART OF THE PROPOSED EVALUATION\nPROCEDURE\nThe inﬂuence of rms values and phase angles of the higher\nharmonics on transformation accuracy of the distorted current\nby inductive CTs results from the change of the magnetic ﬂux\ndensity in the magnetic core of the inductive CT (Fig.5).\nIn the condition B max the magnetic ﬂux is increased in\nrelation to the sinusoidal conditions. This results from both\nits shape and increase of its rms value due to the higher\nharmonics. Therefore, for high value of the load of the sec-\nondary winding and high rms value of the primary current\nit may cause increase of the transformation errors and even\nsaturation of the magnetic core. Moreover, the rms values of\nthe self-generated low order higher harmonics into the sec-\nondary current also increases. The decrease of the magnetic\nﬂux density in the case B min will have the opposite result.\nIf in the CT the turns correction is made, the current error\nof the distorted current transformation by inductive CTs for\nFIGURE 6. The flowchart of the proposed procedure to determine the\nmaximum values of current and phase errors at harmonics for\ntransformation of distorted current by the tested inductive CT.\nthe low value of the load of the secondary winding is positive.\nFurther decrease of the magnetic ﬂux density in the case B min\nwill cause the increase of its value as it will become more\npositive. The increase of the magnetic ﬂux density in the case\nBmax will have the opposite result.\nThe ﬂowchart of the proposed procedure to determine the\nmaximum values of current and phase errors at harmonics for\ntransformation of the distorted current by the tested inductive\nCT for its speciﬁed value and type of load of the secondary\nwinding is presented in Fig.6.\nIn accordance with presented above ﬂowchart ﬁrst the\nvalues of current and phase errors at harmonics for transfor-\nmation of the distorted current with single higher harmonic\nare determined. During this evaluation in the step 1 of the\nproposed procedure the inﬂuence of the phase angle of the\nhigher harmonic in the transformed primary current in rela-\ntion to its main component is considered. This is required due\nto determine the maximum values of current and phase errors\nat harmonics for transformation of higher harmonic of the dis-\ntorted current. The change of the values of current and phase\nerrors results from the different phase angle for summation of\nhigher harmonic in transformed primary current with higher\nharmonic already present in the secondary current due its self-\ndistortion by the inductive CT. This phenomenon is discussed\nin ‘‘5. Generation of the lower order harmonics and their\ninﬂuence on the values of current and phase error of transfor-\nmation of higher harmonics of distorted current’’. In the step\n2 of the procedure current and phase errors are determined for\ntransformation of sinusoidal current and the main harmonic\nof distorted current in the conditions B min and Bmax. The tests\nare made for required operation range of rms values of the\nVOLUME 8, 2020 118889\nM. Kaczmarek, E. Stano: Nonlinearity of Magnetic Core in Evaluation of Current and Phase Errors\nprimary current and load of the secondary winding of a given\nCT. The step 2 of the procedure is used to determine increase\nof the current and phase errors of transformation of distorted\ncurrent caused by the conditions B min and B max. Increase of\nthe magnetic ﬂux density caused by higher harmonics may be\ndecreased by derating of the load of the secondary winding\n[27]. Than the step 2 of the procedure is repeated for the\nreduced load of the secondary winding. Procedure result is\npositive if the B max conditions does not cause increase of\nthe current and phase error of transformation of the main\nharmonic of the distorted current with rated or decreased\nload of the secondary winding. Simultaneously, the B min\nconditions may not cause increase of the current and phase\nerror for 25% of load of the secondary winding. Therefore,\nmaximum values of the current and phase errors at harmonics\nfor transformation of distorted current by the tested inductive\nCT for its speciﬁed load of the secondary winding may be\ndetermined. Procedure result is negative if derating of the load\nof the secondary winding has no expected effect. It means\nthat the tested CT is no able to obtaining the condition of no\nsigniﬁcant increase of the values of current and phase errors\nof transformation of the main harmonic of distorted current in\nthe conditions B max and B min in relation to values measured\nfor sinusoidal current. This results from the fact that for such\ninductive CT maximum values may not be determined by\nthe procedure since the magnetisation characteristic of its\nmagnetic core is strongly nonlinear. Obviously it may not\nbe used for accurate transformation of the distorted current\ndue to high self-distortion of its secondary current. During\nveriﬁcation of the procedure the values of current and phase\nerrors at harmonics are determined in the conditions B max\nand Bmin. This evaluation in contrast to values determined in\nstep 1 of the proposed procedure the inﬂuence of the phase\nangle of higher harmonic in transformed primary current in\nrelation to its main component is not considered. This is due\nto the fact that if phase angle of any harmonic is changed the\nmaximum Bmax or the minimum B min values of the magnetic\nﬂux density for the limiting rms values of the higher harmon-\nics in accordance with the standard IEC 61000-3-12 are not\nobtained. Procedure veriﬁcation is positive if simultaneously\ndetermined values of current and phase errors of order 1 st to\n13th harmonics are lower than determined for the each higher\nharmonic separately in the step 1.\nV. GENERATION OF THE LOWER ORDER HARMONICS\nAND THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE VALUES OF CURRENT\nAND PHASE ERROR OF TRANSFORMATION OF\nHIGHER HARMONICS OF DISTORTED CURRENT\nIn this section the results of accuracy tests of both inductive\nCTs during transformation of the distorted currents composed\nof the main harmonic of frequency 50 Hz and the one single\nharmonic of order from 3 rd to 100 th are presented. First,\nthe analyses of the higher harmonics content of their sec-\nondary current during transformation of sinusoidal primary\ncurrent are made. This is important to estimate the level of\nthe self-distortion of their secondary current. It is caused by\nFIGURE 7. The rms values of higher harmonics in the secondary current\nof 50 Hz type tested CT for transformation of the sinusoidal current.\nthe nonlinearity of the magnetization characteristic of the\nmagnetic core and depends from the load of the secondary\nwinding and the rms value of the primary current. Measured\nrms values of the higher harmonics of the secondary current\nduring transformation of the sinusoidal current by the tested\nCT designed for transformation of the sinusoidal current are\npresented in Fig. 7.\nIn Fig.7. the following notations are used: LL – 25% of\nrated load, LH – rated load, I ghk – the percentage value\nof higher harmonic in relation to rms value of main har-\nmonic of distorted secondary current.\nThe test were made for values of primary currents equal\nto 5%, 20%, 100% and 120% of the rated value equal to\n5 A and two values of the load of the secondary winding.\nIn the case of the rated load of tested CT, values of generated\nhigher harmonics in secondary current are higher than for\n25% of rated load. Moreover, the number of the higher har-\nmonics in the secondary current increases. This is due to the\nincrease of the magnetic ﬂux density causing the movement\nof CT’s operating point on the magnetization characteristic\nfrom point B 1(H1) nearer to its knee into the nonlinear region\nin point B 2(H2) as presented in Fig.8.\nThe value of the magnetic ﬂux density in the core as results\nfrom equation (9) increases with load of the secondary wind-\ning and value of the primary current. Therefore, the highest\nvalue of the magnetic ﬂux density is obtained for rated load of\nthe inductive CT and 120% of its rated primary current (150%\nor 200% if applicable). Higher harmonics in distorted primary\ncurrent causes the change of the magnetizing curve of the\nmagnetic core from black line to red line [7], [25]. Therefore,\nfor the same magnetic ﬁeld strength H 2 higher magnetic ﬂux\ndensity B 3 is obtained. Moreover, as presented in Fig. 9 for\nthe case Bmax, there is an increase of the self-generation of the\nhigher harmonics into the secondary current by tested 50 Hz\ntype inductive CT. This is due to the increase of the magnetic\nﬂux density causing by the change of the magnetization\ncharacteristic and the movement of CT’s operating point from\n118890 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM.

The rms values of higher harmonics in the secondary current\nof 50 Hz type tested CT for transformation of the distorted current in the\ncase Bmax.\npoint B2(H2) deeper into its nonlinear region in point B 3(H2)\nas presented in Fig.8.\nDue to the explained self-distortion of the inductive CT’s\nsecondary current the low order higher harmonic of distorted\nprimary current transformed by CT adds up with the same\nfrequency self-generated harmonic. The maximum and mini-\nmum values of current and phase errors determined with con-\nsideration of the inﬂuence of self-generated by the wideband\nCT higher harmonics are presented in Fig.10.\nThe values of current and phase errors at harmonics were\ndetermined for transformation of the distorted primary cur-\nrent of main frequency 50 Hz with single higher harmonics\nof frequency from 100 Hz to 5 kHz. The measurements are\nmade for the rated rms value of the primary current and the\nrated load of the secondary winding. It results from Fig.7 that\nsigniﬁcant is only the impact of higher harmonics of frequen-\ncies below 650 Hz self-generated by wideband type CT. To\nobtain MAX\\MIN characteristics the phase angle of primary\ncurrent’s higher harmonic in relation to the main harmonic\nis changed for each frequency from 0 ◦ to 360 ◦ in the 10 ◦\nsteps. The decrease of the values of current and phase errors\nalong with the frequency of transformed lower order higher\nharmonic (starting from 5 th) results from the increase with\nFIGURE 10. The influence of the self-generated by wideband CT higher\nharmonics on current and phase errors of transformation of higher\nharmonics of distorted primary current for rated rms value and load.\nfrequency of the reactance of the magnetic core and therefore\ndecrease of the excitation current. This is obtained due to the\nhigh quality magnetic core that ensures high permeability and\nlow power losses in the magnetic core in the frequency range\nup to 5 kHz. The main aspect in which the results presented\nin the Fig.9 were analysed is the inﬂuence of self-generated\nby the wideband type CT low order higher harmonics on\nits transformation accuracy of higher harmonics of distorted\nprimary currents. In the case when low order higher harmonic\nin transformed distorted current is in phase with generated\nharmonic, negative current error is decreased and it obtains\npositive value. While when their phases are opposite nega-\ntive current error is increased. Moreover, if transformed low\norder higher harmonic is 90 ◦shifted in phase in relation to\ngenerated harmonic, negative phase error is decreased and it\nobtains positive value. While when their phases are shifted\nby 270 ◦negative phase error is increased. The dependence\nof the values of current and phase errors of transformation\nof 3rd higher harmonic from its phase angle in relation to main\nharmonic of distorted primary current is presented in Fig.10.\nIt result from self-generation of the same frequency harmonic\nin the secondary current caused by nonlinearity of the tested\nwideband type inductive CT.\nIn Fig.11. the following notations are used: Composite \\\nCurrent\\Phase error 100%\\20% – maximum (solid line)\nand minimum (dashed line) values of composite\\current\\\nphase error determined for 3 rd higher harmonic if primary\ncurrent is equal to 100%\\20% of rated rms value.\nThe course of the changes of current and phase errors\nof transformation of higher harmonic by inductive CTs is\nsinusoidal. Amplitude and Y axis offset of such waveform\ndepends on CT operating conditions that determine values\nof current and phase errors without the inﬂuence of self-\ngenerated by the tested CT harmonic in the secondary current.\nThe results conﬁrming such inﬂuence for 20% of rms value\nof primary current and rated load are presented in Fig.12.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 118891\nM.

The influence of self-generated by the wideband CT higher\nharmonics on current and phase errors of transformation of higher\nharmonics of distorted primary current for 20% of rated rms value and\nrated load (the notations are used same as in Fig.10).\nThe maximum values of phase and current errors deter-\nmined for transformation of low order higher harmonics by\nthe tested wideband type CT as presented in Fig. 12 have\nlower values than for rated rms value of primary current\nand same load (Fig.10). This results from lower distortion\nof the secondary current caused by nonlinearity of the mag-\nnetic core. The magnetization characteristic of the tested\nCT’s magnetic core becomes more nonlinear with increase\nof the rms value of the primary current towards its saturation.\nHowever, CT’s nonlinearity due to the magnetic core is still\npresent.\nVI. ESTIMATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHANGE OF\nTHE MAGNETIC FLUX DENSITY CAUSED BY DISTORTION\nON THE SELF-GENERATION OF HIGHER HARMONICS\nINTO THE SECONDARY CURRENT OF CT\nThe measuring circuit presented in Fig.13 is used ﬁrst for\nveriﬁcation of determined by the digital power meter val-\nues of current and phase errors of transformation of the\nmain harmonic of distorted current with current compara-\ntor. It is designed to tests accuracy of inductive CTs for\nFIGURE 13. The measuring circuit for verification of determined values of\ncurrent and phase errors of transformation of main harmonic of distorted\ncurrent with current comparator.\ntransformation of sinusoidal current. Therefore, it is equipped\nwith the 50 Hz bandpass ﬁlter.\nUsage of the current comparator required disconnection\nof the differential wire due to forced ground in the terminal\nof the reference CT on the input (RCT). The digital power\nmeter is used in this measuring circuit for control of the rms\nvalues of harmonics in distorted primary and secondary cur-\nrents and voltages on primary and secondary windings of the\ntested CT.\nEstimation of the inﬂuence of the change of the magnetic\nﬂux density caused by higher harmonics on self-generation\nof higher harmonics into the secondary current of the CT\nis made from the change in the values of current and\nphase errors of transformation of main harmonic of distorted\ncurrent.\nIn Table 2 determined by current comparator values of cur-\nrent and phase errors of transformation of the main harmonic\nof distorted current by the 50 Hz type inductive CT designed\nfor transformation of sinusoidal current are presented. The\nresults concern cases B max, B min and transformation of dis-\ntorted current with single higher harmonic (50 Hz +hk).\nIn both tables the highest values of current and phase errors\nfor each tested case are bolded.\nFirst important conclusion from the results presented in\nthe table above is that the increase of the magnetic ﬂux\ndensity in the case Bmax causes signiﬁcant increase of the\nvalues of current and phase errors of transformation of main\nharmonic of distorted current. In conditions of rated load\nof the secondary winding and main harmonic of distorted\ncurrent equal to 120% of rated primary current signiﬁcant\ndecrease of transformation accuracy of the main harmonic of\ndistorted current is detected. Therefore, the self-generation of\n118892 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. Kaczmarek, E. Stano: Nonlinearity of Magnetic Core in Evaluation of Current and Phase Errors\nTABLE 2. Current and phase errors of transformation of the main\nharmonic of the distorted current by the 50 Hz type inductive CT\nfor tested casesBmax , Bmin and with single higher harmonic.\nhigher harmonics into the secondary current of tested CT is\nalso increased. Therefore, derating of the secondary winding\nrated load to 8 W is required to ensure highest accuracy of\nwideband transformation and lowest values of current\\phase\nerrors at harmonics. Then in conditions of rated load of the\nsecondary winding and main harmonic of distorted current\nequal to 120% of rated primary current no increase of the\nvalues of current and phase errors of transformation of main\nharmonic of distorted current is detected.\nThe decrease of the rms value of the main harmonic of\ndistorted current in the case Bmin in relation to other two\ncases (B max and sin 50 Hz +h.) causes increase of the\nvalues of current and phase errors of its transformation. This\noccurs in all cases except conditions for the rated load of\nthe secondary winding and the main harmonic of distorted\ncurrent equal to 100% and 120% of the rated primary current.\nTherefore, only if high value of the magnetic ﬂux density\nin the magnetic core is obtained it leads to decrease of the\nvalues of current and phase errors of transformation of the\nmain harmonic of the distorted current. This results then from\nthe CT operation beyond the linear region of its magnetization\ncharacteristic (Fig.8). The decrease of the rms value of main\nharmonic of distorted current cause decrease of the magnetic\nﬂux density in the magnetic core. In result the CT operates\ncloser to the linear region of its magnetization characteristic.\nIn Table 3 determined by the current comparator values of\ncurrent and phase errors of transformation of main harmonic\nof distorted current by the wideband type inductive CT for\ntested cases B max, Bmin and the distorted current with single\nhigher harmonic are presented.\nIn the case Bmax tested the wideband CT is not beyond\nthe linear region of its magnetization characteristic for any\nof the rms values of the primary current. Therefore, there is\nno increase of the values of current and phase errors of the\nmain harmonics transformation. However, similar increase of\nthe positive value of these errors as for previously tested the\n50 Hz type inductive CT is detected in the case Bmin for 25%\nof rated load of its secondary winding.\nTABLE 3. Current and phase errors of transformation of the main\nharmonic of the distorted current by the wideband type inductive CT for\ntested casesBmax , Bmin and with single higher harmonic.\nIn the case when sinusoidal voltage with single higher\nharmonic is transformed by both tested CTs the values of\ncurrent and phase errors are not increased by changes of the\nmagnetic ﬂux density caused by higher harmonics.\nVII. THE SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS FROM THE\nWIDEBAND TRANSFORMATION ACCURACY\nTESTS OF CTs\nProposed evaluation procedure enables determination of the\nhighest values of current and phase errors for transformation\nof the higher harmonics of the distorted primary current\nwith the limited permissible distortion. In Fig.14 the ﬁnal\ncomplete set of the results fully specifying the wideband\ntransformation accuracy of the 50 Hz type inductive CT is\npresented.\nIn Fig.14. the following notations are used: 5%, 20%,\n100%, 120% and LH (dashed line) or LL (solid line) – a given\npercentage of rated primary current and a given percentage of\nrated load of the secondary winding of tested CT.\nFrom the results presented in Fig.14 the accuracy class of\ntransformation of sinusoidal current of frequency equal to\n50 Hz may be determined as well as wideband accuracy of\ntransformation of higher harmonics of distorted primary cur-\nrent. The accuracy class for sinusoidal current is 0.5, taking\ninto consideration deﬁned limits for current and phase errors\nin the standard IEC 61869-2: (I 1 = 5%: ±1.5%, ±1.5◦),\n(I1 =20%: ±0.75%, ±0.75◦), (I 1 =100%\\120%: ±0.5%,\n±0.5◦). It can be clearly seen that if same limits are used\nfor evaluation of the wideband accuracy class the problem\nfor low frequency higher harmonics lays ﬁrst in accuracy\nof transformation of the 3 rd harmonic (I 1 =100%\\120%:\n1Ih =±1.0%\\1.2% for rated load). Further derating of the\nload of the secondary winding of the 50 Hz type inductive\nCT than previously adopted value equal to 8 W will only\nincrease the frequency band of its operation in 0.5 accuracy\nclass to 11 th harmonic. This results from the fact that for the\nsecondary winding load equal to 2 W the value of current\nerror of transformation of 15 th higher harmonic is now equal\nVOLUME 8, 2020 118893\nM.

Therefore, further derating of the load will result\nin increase of the positive current error for 25% of rated load\nand even for higher harmonic of lower order. Moreover, as\nresults from determined values of current error starting from\n70th higher harmonic the accepted limit value of the current\nerror equal to ±0.5% is exceeded for rated load of the tested\nCT secondary winding.\nIn Fig.15 the ﬁnal complete set of the results fully speci-\nfying the wideband transformation accuracy of the wideband\ntype inductive CT is presented.\nIn the case of the inductive CT described by the manu-\nfacturer as wideband type, it can be conﬁrmed from results\npresented in Fig.15 that its accuracy class is 0.5 for transfor-\nmation of the sinusoidal current of frequency equal to 50 Hz.\nMoreover, as results from determined wideband transforma-\ntion accuracy the value of current error exceeds accepted\nin this considerations limiting value of current error equal\nto ±0.5% only for 3 rd higher harmonic. This concerns only\nrated load of the secondary winding of the tested wideband\ntype CT and condition when its primary current in equal to\n120% of its rated value. Example calculations are presented\nfor 10 th harmonic and this wideband type CT at 100% of its\nrated primary current and rated load of its secondary winding\nfrom measured quantities:\n• the rms value of the hk harmonic (U RShk) in voltage of\ncurrent shunt R S (0.1 ) equal to 0.0501 V,\n• the rms value of the hk harmonic (U RDhk) in voltage of\ncurrent shunt R D (1 ) equal to 0.0017 V,\n• the phase angle (φ kh) between hk harmonic of voltages\nU1h and URDhk equal to 17.4 ◦.\nAccording to equation (3) the rms value of the 10 th harmonic\nof the secondary current of tested CT is equal to 0.4994 A.\nThe percentage value of the composite error in relation to its\nrms value in distorted primary current is determined from the\nequation (2) and is equal to 0.333%. Then, the value of the\ncurrent error according to equation (4) is equal to 0.032% and\nthe value of the phase errors determined from equation (5) is\nequal to 0.052 ◦.\nVIII. VERIFICATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE\nPROCEDURE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM\nVALUES OF CURRENT AND PHASE ERRORS\nAT HARMONICS\nPresented in this paragraph values of current and phase errors\nof transformation of the harmonics of the distorted primary\ncurrent in the range of frequencies from 100 Hz to 5 kHz are\ndetermined in the measuring circuit from Fig.1. The measure-\nments are made for the conditions when the maximum (B max )\nand the minimum (B min) peak values were achieved in tested\nCT’s magnetic core. The values of current and phase errors\nat harmonics from 1 st to 13 th and hk higher harmonics up\nto order 100 th are simultaneously determined. These results\npresented in Fig.16 are compared with the values of current\nand phase errors at harmonics obtained for transformation of\ndistorted current composed of the main frequency harmonic\nand one higher harmonic (50Hz+hk) in step 1 of the proposed\nprocedure. In this conditions the inﬂuence of the phase angle\nof higher harmonic in transformed primary current in relation\nto its main component is considered. The values of current\nand phase errors at hk higher harmonics up to order 100 th are\ndetermined severally.\nIn Fig.16. the following notations are used: CE (solid\nline)\\PE (dashed line) - values of current \\phase error deter-\nmined in conditions B max, Bmin and (50 Hz+hk).\nIncrease of the magnetic ﬂux density in the case B max\ncauses the increase of the self-generation of the low order\nhigher harmonics into the secondary current by the tested\n50 Hz type CT in relation to results obtained for transforma-\ntion of distorted primary current with single higher harmonic\n(50Hz+hk). Performed derating of the load of the secondary\nwinding to 8 W causes that the valaues of current\\phase\nerrors become equal to obtained for the case B min and lower\nthan in case (50Hz+hk). Therefore, the maximum values of\ncurrent and phase errors at harmonics for transformation of\n118894 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM. Kaczmarek, E.

The values of current and phase errors at harmonics\ndetermined for the wideband type CT and 120% of the rated primary\ncurrent with the rated load in the conditions Bmax, Bmin and (50Hz+hk)\n(the notations are used as in Fig.16).\nthe distorted current by the tested 50 Hz type CT are deter-\nmined in accordance with proposed procedure. Such trans-\nformation accuracy of tested CT is ensured for its secondary\nwinding load from 2 W to 8 W and the primary current rms\nvalue from 5% to 120% with the highest distortion acceptable\nin accordance with the standard IEC 61000-3-12.\nIn Fig.17 the values of current and phase errors of harmon-\nics transformation by wideband type CT for 120% of rms\nvalue of primary current and rated load determined in the\nconditions Bmax, Bmin and (50 Hz+hk) are presented.\nThe wideband type inductive CT is characterized by low\ndistortion of the secondary current in relation to the 50 Hz\ntype inductive CT made by the same manufacturer. More-\nover, transformation accuracy of the higher harmonics in the\nfrequencies range from 100 Hz to 5 kHz is also signiﬁcantly\nhigher. The limiting value of current error equal to ±0.5%\nonly for 3 rd higher harmonic is exceeded. The values of\ncurrent and phase errors obtained for the cases B max and Bmin\nare lower than determined in case (50Hz+hk). The change\nof the magnetic ﬂux density cause no change in determined\nvalues of current and phase errors. This results from the fact\nFIGURE 18. The values of current and phase errors at harmonics\ndetermined for the wideband type CT and 5% of the rated primary current\nwith 25% of the rated load in the conditions Bmax, Bmin and (50Hz+hk)\n(the notations are used as in Fig.16).\nthat the operating point of the CT is still in the linear region of\nthe magnetization characteristic of its magnetic core (Fig.8).\nIn Fig.18 values of current and phase errors of harmonics\ntransformation by the wideband type CT for 5% of rms value\nof primary current and 25% of rated load are presented.\nIn the case of the wideband inductive CT small distortion\nof secondary current is detected also for 5% of rms value of\nprimary current and 25% of rated load. The values of current\nand phase errors obtained for cases B max and B min are still\nlower than determined in case (50Hz+hk).\nIn the case of both tested CTs proposed procedure was\nveriﬁed to be effective and ensures determination of the max-\nimum values of current and phase errors of transformation of\nthe harmonics of the distorted current.\nIX. CONCLUSION\nThe results of presented analysis shows that in the evaluation\nof the wideband accuracy of the inductive CTs the impact\nof the primary current harmonics on the peak value of the\nmagnetic ﬂux density in the magnetic core and their phase\nangles in relation to the self-generated higher harmonics into\nthe secondary current must be considered. The dependence\nof the values of current and phase errors of transformation\nof higher harmonic by the inductive CT from its phase angle\nin relation to main harmonic of distorted primary current is\nsinusoidal. Therefore, every 90 ◦the value of current or phase\nerror is decreased or increased. Obtained differences between\ndetermined values of current and phase errors at harmonics\nmay be simultaneously caused by the change of the magne-\ntizing curve of the magnetic core. The same magnetic ﬁeld\nstrength in the magnetic core for distorted primary current\nmay cause higher value of the magnetic ﬂux density is the\nmagnetic core. Therefore, there may be also an increase of the\nself-generation of the higher harmonics into the secondary\ncurrent of the inductive CT. However, such deterioration of\ntheir accuracy may be limited by derating of the load of\nthe secondary winding. Moreover, this impact of the higher\nVOLUME 8, 2020 118895\nM. Kaczmarek, E.
