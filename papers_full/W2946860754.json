    "abstract": "In gardening, a large amount of work is done in crown care and harvesting.Automated harvesting gains special significance due to uneven ripening of fruits and berries.Electrification of these works contributes to increasing the productivity and reducing production costs.One of the methods of automated harvesting of fruits and berries is vibratory.To create vibrations, the use of a linear electric motor is recommended.The presented electric motor can be used for harvesting devices and for manual electrified pruners and delimbers.Analysis of the existing linear electric motors made it possible to identify their shortcomings.The main disadvantage is the low thrust of the armature and expensive technology in the manufacture.The work of the proposed electric motor is based on the use of magnetic flux scattering.These magnetic fluxes appear as a result of magnetic saturation of sections of the magnetic system.The design of the magnetic system of the stator of the motor is alternating sections of large and small thickness in the ratio of 1/3.The magnetic flux passing through a section of the magnetic system of small thickness is ejected toward the armature and magnetizing the coil due to magnetic saturation.The armature of the electric motor is made in the form of alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic rings.The displaced magnetic flux from the magnetic system of the stator passes through the magnetic ring of the armature.As a result, a force acts on the armature, forcing it to move.The main task in modeling a linear electric motor is to rationalize the design of the magnetic system.It is necessary to obtain the maximum redistribution of the magnetic flux towards the armature.This will increase the armature thrust and efficiency.The studied parameters of the magnetic system are the angle of inclination of the poles and the length of narrowing of the magnetic circuit.The results of the study show that the maximum value of the thrust force F a = 59.32 N is obtained at α = 90º and l = 10 mm.",
