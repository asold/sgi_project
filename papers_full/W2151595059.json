    "abstract": "The paper deals with modelling and design of HF 200 kHz (and more) low-power transformers with determinated leakage induct-ances for both hard- and soft-switching applications. The first group features by small value of the leakage inductance contrary to sec-ond one demanding that value substantially higher. The further aims of the design are minimized weights and dimensions of the trans-formers. Results of numerical simulations and experimental verifications of designed transformers operated in converter circuits are given at the end of the paper.
