    "abstract": "AI is often looked at as a logical rational way to develop a games agent that methodically looks at options and delivers rational solutions. This paper is based on developing an AI agent that plays a game with a similar emotive content like a human. The purpose of the study was to see if the incorporation of this emotive content would influence the outcomes within the game Love Letter. In order to do this an AI agent with an emotive layer was developed to paly the game over a million times. A lower win/loss ratio demonstrates that to some extent this methodology was vindicated and a 100 per cent win for the AI agent did not happen. Machine learning techniques were modelled purposely so as to match extreme models of behavioural change. The results demonstrated a win/loss ration of 0.67 for the AI agent and in many ways reflectd the frustration that a normal player would exhibit during game play. As was hypothesised the final agent investment value was, on average, lower after matchplay than its initial value.",
