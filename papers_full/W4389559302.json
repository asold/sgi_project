    "abstract": "Background Varenicline is a pharmacological intervention for tobacco dependence that is safe and effective in facilitating smoking cessation. Enhanced adherence to varenicline augments the probability of prolonged smoking abstinence. However, research has shown that one-third of people who use varenicline are nonadherent by the second week. There is evidence showing that behavioral support helps with medication adherence. We have designed an artificial intelligence (AI) conversational agent or health bot, called “ChatV,” based on evidence of what works as well as what varenicline is, that can provide these supports. ChatV is an evidence-based, patient- and health care provider–informed health bot to improve adherence to varenicline. ChatV has been programmed to provide medication reminders, answer questions about varenicline and smoking cessation, and track medication intake and the number of cigarettes. Objective This study aims to explore the feasibility of the ChatV health bot, to examine if it is used as intended, and to determine the appropriateness of proceeding with a randomized controlled trial. Methods We will conduct a mixed methods feasibility study where we will pilot-test ChatV with 40 participants. Participants will be provided with a standard 12-week varenicline regimen and access to ChatV. Passive data collection will include adoption measures (how often participants use the chatbot, what features they used, when did they use it, etc). In addition, participants will complete questionnaires (at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks) assessing self-reported smoking status and varenicline adherence, as well as questions regarding the acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of the chatbot, and participate in an interview assessing acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, and adoption. We will use “stop, amend, and go” progression criteria for pilot studies to decide if a randomized controlled trial is a reasonable next step and what modifications are required. A health equity lens will be adopted during participant recruitment and data analysis to understand and address the differences in uptake and use of this digital health solution among diverse sociodemographic groups. The taxonomy of implementation outcomes will be used to assess feasibility, that is, acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, adoption, and usability. In addition, medication adherence and smoking cessation will be measured to assess the preliminary treatment effect. Interview data will be analyzed using the framework analysis method. Results Participant enrollment for the study will begin in January 2024. Conclusions By using predetermined progression criteria, the results of this preliminary study will inform the determination of whether to advance toward a larger randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the health bot. Additionally, this study will explore the acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, adoption, and usability of the health bot. These insights will be instrumental in refining the intervention and the health bot.

However many\npatients become non-adherent and fail to complete the course. Intensive support can improve adherence but is very costly.\nThe application aims to:\n1.Co-create and develop a chatbot to increase adherence to varenicline.\n2.Evaluate the chatbot in terms of:\na) Implementation outcomes, i.e., adoption, acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness.\nb) Medication adherence and smoking cessation success\n3.Explore the feasibility of participant recruitment, retention and data collection.\n \nThe application will use the Discover, Design/Build and Test Framework to co design the chatbox involving 1) review the\nliterature and conduct interviews with potential users (Discovery Phase), 2) conduct Wizard of Oz testing (Design/Build\nPhase); 3) Train and test the chatbot (Test Phase). They will recruit (from diverse sources): 20 participants for the\ninterviews, 40 participants for the WoZ, 20 participants for training the chatbot, and 40 participants (different than those\nrecruited for the WoZ) for the feasibility study. They will stratify by age and gender and expect that their recruitment\napproach will ensure diversity on other factors. WoZ participants will include individuals at different levels of varenicline\nuse.\nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 1 / Évaluateur 1\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nPage 2\n \nStrengths and Weaknesses/Forces et faiblesses: \nStrengths\n1.Well written and clear application.\n2. This is a resubmission. The response to reviewers is very thoughtful and clarifies a number of issues about the\npracticalities of conducting this research that were missing in the previous version and persuade me about the feasibility and\nvalue of the work. The applicants have expanded the team to include a member with more qualitative expertise.\n3.The project is led by and EDI who has an impressive track record for someone at their career level. The research team has\na nice balance of expertise and experience. Two senior team members have previously worked with Dr Minian\n4. There is appropriate use of KT theories and concepts (use of TDF (with the recent intersectionality extension), Taxonomy\nof Implementation Outcomes, NASSS).\n5. They highlight the importance of gender differences to smoking cessation in general (where women less likely to\nsuccessfully stop) and varenicline (which has greater short term efficacy in women). Gender will be considered during\nrecruitment (to ensure representation) and analysis of the various studies.\n6.Clear stop, amend go rules for proceeding to a definitive trial (now including criteria relating to acceptability,\nappropriateness and usability)\nWeaknesses\nIt would have been nice to have more information about the proposed synthesis (in particular more details about the types of\nstudies that will be included and more methodological detail about how they will code studies using COM-B and BCTs).\nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 1 / Évaluateur 1\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nPage 3\n \nBudget Recommendation/Recommandation budgétaire: \nNo major concerns.\nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 1 / Évaluateur 1\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nPage 4\n \nPlease indicate your appraisal of the integration of sex as a biological variable as a strength, weakness, or not\napplicable to the proposal./Prière de sélectionner une option pour donner votre évaluation de l'intégration du sexe\ncomme variable biologique en tant que point fort ou point faible de la proposition, ou en tant qu'élément non\napplicable à la proposition.\n \n \nPlease indicate your appraisal of the integration of gender as a socio-cultural determinant of health as a strength,\nweakness, or not applicable to the proposal./Prière de sélectionner une option pour donner votre évaluation de\nl'intégration du genre comme déterminant socioculturel de la santé en tant que point fort ou point faible de la\nproposition, ou en tant qu'élément non applicable à la proposition.\n \nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 1 / Évaluateur 1\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nStrength/Point fort\nWeakness/Point faible\nNot applicable/Non applicable\nStrength/Point fort\nWeakness/Point faible\nNot applicable/Non applicable\nPage 5\n\n \nSex and/or Gender Considerations/Notions de sexe et/ou de genre: \nThey highlight the importance of gender differences to smoking cessation in general (where women less likely to\nsuccessfully stop) and varenicline (which has greater short term efficacy in women).

Passive data collection\nincludes adoption measures (how often participants use the chatbot, what features they used and when did they use it);\nactive data collection includes questionnaires at 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks to assessing self-reported smoking status and\nvarenicline adherence as well as questions regarding acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of the chatbot, and\ninterviews assessing acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity and adoption.\n•Exploring the feasibility of participant recruitment, retention and data collection through the ‘Stop, Amend, Go’\nprogression criteria for pilot studies to decide if a RCT is a reasonable next step.\n \nAssuming the feasibility study warrants it, results will be used to develop a full-scale RCT to test the efficacy of the chatbot,\nwith potential to improving adherence to effective medications that reduce tobacco use and the burden of tobacco related\nillnesses. There is also potential to improve adherence to other medications.\nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 2 / Évaluateur 2\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nPage 2\n \nStrengths and Weaknesses/Forces et faiblesses: \nSTRENGTHS\n-This is a very well-written proposal by a promising early career researcher with dissemination and implementation\nexpertise and experience, a track record of co-developing interventions with users, and a strong team and institutional\nenvironment supporting her.\n \n-The proposal is an excellent build on the team's previous work; particularly interesting is their exploration about why\nsometimes tools just don’t work (a previous study showed that a decision support tool  did not increase the likelihood of\npractitioners offering an educational alcohol resource, due to physicians’ discomfort, as well as busy-ness and inadequate\ntraining)\n \n-The methodology relies heavily on a range of evidence – that the applicant and her team have developed, as well as others.\nAll aspects of the study appear to be evidence-informed; the proposal is well-referenced.\n \n-The mixed methods design is strong, and there is a good emphasis on future implementation outcomes for the future (phase\n2); phase 3 – determining whether to move forward or not – is well laid-out.\n \n-The risks and mitigation section is well done.\n \nWEAKNESSES\n \nI found few weaknesses in this application as I feel that previous reviewers’ excellent guidance has been used to improve an\nalready-strong application.\n \nA few things I had questions about as I read:\n \n•To what extent is the chatbot informational vs motivational, and what issues might this raise\n•Is there a concern about what happens after 12 weeks on varenicline\n•One thing that wasn’t clear to me were the participants in the literature review phase, which the application states will\ninvolve “end users and clinicians to redefine the question.” Which end users where these, and which clinicians and how\nwould the latter be recruited?\n•The training of the participants by the research assistant on the chatbot is an important step…what will it involve, will it be\nevaluated, etc.  This could shed light on what’s needed in future (i.e., is sending a link to a chatbot enough, or is training\nrequired)\n \n \nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 2 / Évaluateur 2\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nPage 3\n \nBudget Recommendation/Recommandation budgétaire: \nSeems appropriate;

Description of qualitative approach\nand triangulation reasonable. Excellent description of the decision-making process about whether to continue the work to a\nmore formal RCT, but since this seems to be future research I wonder if some of this space could be reclaimed for methods\nfor the current work.\n \nTeam is reasonably strong, but relevance of expertise is not always clear; not clear what experience an expert in HCI has\nwith interviewing patients, for example, or who has the KT experience, even though both are reasonably well described in\nthe methods. The expertise may well be there, it just isn’t clear in the description of the team. PI is a new investigator; this\nwould be first funding as PI. Has some experience as co-I on tri-council grants. 15 articles published since 2016, all as first\nauthor. Just starting as a supervisor.\n \nWeaknesses\nOverall, the justification for choosing a chatbot as the delivery approach of course could be stronger. While arguments\nabout COVID placing emphasis on virtual care and need to scale support for adherence are well made, it isn’t clear why a\nchatbot specifically is seen as the best way to address challenges to adherence. What are the mechanisms by which you see\nthis approach as the most promising scalable approach to this issue? To what extent have chatbots been shown to be\neffective vehicles for behavioural supports of this sort? Some of the mechanisms by which this approach might have its\neffects (tracking medications, reminders, providing knowledge) are outlined, but the extent to which these address known\nbarriers would strengthen this justification. Do you think the relevant barriers are going to be helped by tracking meds,\nreminders, etc?\n \nSummary of progress page is heavily skewed towards description of the PI’s cv rather than description of progress on the\nproject itself. While description of experience is relevant, how they inform the current project specifically is not clear.\nSpecifying development of relationships, skills, initial literature evaluation, etc could strengthen this section.\n \nUser-centered design usually involves identifying a priori usability goals that inform the design process and let you know\nwhen to stop testing; these are not provided.\n \nJustification of why a rapid review rather than some other form of review would strengthen.\nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 3 / Évaluateur 3\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nPage 3\n \nJustification of the feasibility of recruitment would strengthen; have these recruitment approaches been used in similar\nstudies in the past?\n \nQualitative methods include an apparent contradiction that needs to be addressed. While there is reference to a consensus\nprocess to resolve differences between coders of interviews, there is also discussion of ‘employing inter-rater reliability’;\ntypically it is one or the other, and so if some components of the analysis will enable reliability analysis and others won’t,\nthis should be spelled out.\n \nAuthors state that rules for the simple chatbot will come from lit review, interviews, and testing, but that process is not\nspecified. Will this simply be a series of decisions made by  a programmer?\n \nMeasures include some of Proctor’s taxonomy, but not all; discussion of why the others were excluded would strengthen.\n \nThis is a re-submission, and comments indicate considerable responsiveness to many of the comments, but it appears to my\n(new reviewer) eyes that a couple of the major issues are still outstanding. For example, the KT section should also include\nplanned efforts to engage in KT of the study results. Furthermore, while this project uses several existing KT frameworks to\ngood effect, the case for how this helps advance our understanding of the utility of these frameworks could be more clearly\nmade, as this is part of the mandate of the KTR committee. Previous reviews also pointed out issues with engaging patient\npartners. The proposal mentions the SPOR framework, but there is no mention of patient study partners. The decision not to\ninclude patient partners as part of the study team should be justified, as this seems a clear situation where patient\ninvolvement in the design of this work would be beneficial. Letters of support from relevant patient organisations would\nstrengthen.\nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 3 / Évaluateur 3\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nPage 4\n \nBudget Recommendation/Recommandation budgétaire: \nSeems appropriate. \nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 3 / Évaluateur 3\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nPage 5\n \nPlease indicate your appraisal of the integration of sex as a biological variable as a strength, weakness, or not\napplicable to the proposal./Prière de sélectionner une option pour donner votre évaluation de l'intégration du sexe\ncomme variable biologique en tant que point fort ou point faible de la proposition, ou en tant qu'élément non\napplicable à la proposition.\n \n \nPlease indicate your appraisal of the integration of gender as a socio-cultural determinant of health as a strength,\nweakness, or not applicable to the proposal./Prière de sélectionner une option pour donner votre évaluation de\nl'intégration du genre comme déterminant socioculturel de la santé en tant que point fort ou point faible de la\nproposition, ou en tant qu'élément non applicable à la proposition.\n \nReview Type / Type d'évaluation: Reviewer 3 / Évaluateur 3\nName of Applicant / Nom du chercheur: Minian, Nadia\nApplication No. / Numéro de demande: 469406\nAgency / Agence: CIHR/IRSC\nCompetition / Concours: Project Grant/Subvention Projet\nCommittee / Comité: Knowledge Translation Research/Recherche sur l'application\ndes connaissances\nTitle / Titre: Helping people adhere to their varenicline treatment by co-\ncreating a conversational agent: A feasibility study\nStrength/Point fort\nWeakness/Point faible\nNot applicable/Non applicable\nStrength/Point fort\nWeakness/Point faible\nNot applicable/Non applicable\nPage 6\n\n \nSex and/or Gender Considerations/Notions de sexe et/ou de genre: \nLack of information on feasibility of recruitment is exacerbated by plans to stratify by gender, age, etc., so more details\nwould strengthen.

Will this be a challenge? However, the committee noted this is a feasibility study, which will address \nwhether or not this is feasible.\nThey cite references for and state gender differences in use of the medicine of choice but the reviews they reference are \non sex differences, not gender differences. (REFS 8-10)\nThe justification for choosing a chatbot could be stronger. Although they talk about mechanisms by which a chatbot \nmay be valuable, it is not clear whether these are the actual problems.\n   Description of user-centred design usually involvesa priorigoals. They didn’t lay these goals out.\nQualitative design: the applicants discuss both consensus and inter-rater reliability. Which is it?\nThey mention the SPOR Patient Engagement framework, but it was not clear how this framework in particular would \nbe used to engage patient partners in this study.\nThe applicants talk about scale-up at times. While the intervention needs to be shown effective before scale up, at this \nearly stage, they could certainly begin to explore indicators of scalability.\nWhile there are clear stop, amend, and go rules for proceeding to a definitive trial, they still feel a bit generic.
