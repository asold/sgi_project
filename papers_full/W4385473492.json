  "abstract": "Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLM) have increasingly been utilized in the realm of mental well-being support.

This exploration aimed to shed light on the advantages and potential pitfalls associated with the integration of these sophisticated models in conversational agents intended for mental health support. We found the app (Replika) beneficial in offering on-demand, non-judgmental support, boosting user confidence, and aiding self-discovery. Yet, it faced challenges in filtering harmful content, sustaining consistent communication, remembering new information, and mitigating users' overdependence. The stigma attached further risked isolating users socially.

Among these technologies, conversationagents (CAs) have gained increased attention for their potential to provide mental well-beingandsocial support.Researchhas shownthat usingCAsformentalhealthcarecanleadtoincreasedaccessibilityduetobenefitssuchasreducedcost, time efficiency, andanonymitycomparedtotraditional care strategies\n10\n.

LLMs caninferthecontextsofthe input texts (knownastheprompt),andgeneratetextsthatcoherentlyfollowtheprompts.Peoplehaveusedtheseextraordinary capabilities to build information extraction\n15\n, and code generation systems\n16\n. LLMs potentiallypromise tooffer mental wellness supporttousersbyofferingthemopendialogues,whichparsethesemanticsoftheuser input and therefore interact with the users emotionally. Due tothe potential benefits of LLMs, anincreasingnumber of CAs have recentlyemployedLLMs as their underlyingstructure toprovide healthcare consumers withmental wellness andemotional support\n17–19\n. However, LLMs alsohave limitations. For instance, prior researchhaspointedout that LLM-basedCAs canbechallengingtocontrolintermsofcontentoutputandpreventingharmfulorfalseinformation\n20\n.Suchlimitationscouldpotentiallyhaveadverseeffectsonusers' mentalwell-being.\nGiven the increasing interest in developing and deploying LLM-based CAs for mental well-being support, weconductedqualitative researchtogaininsight intousers' experiences withsuchsystems.Thisinquiryisbothtimelyand critical, as gaining an understanding of healthcare consumers' perspectives on these systems can identifypotential limitations andbenefits of LLM-basedCAs.Ultimately,theseinsightscanenableustocriticallyreflectonwhether LLM-basedCAs shouldbe utilizedfor mental well-beingsupport, andguidefutureresearchanddesignindevelopingmoreresponsible,user-friendly,andsafeLLM-basedCAsformentalwell-beingsupport.\n*:Equalcontributions.\nWe use Replika – a popular and leading LLM-based CA, as a platformto understand users’ experiences withLLM-based CAfor mental well-being support. To do so, we qualitatively analyzed 120Reddit posts (2913usercomments) from the r/Replika subreddit. We found that, in general, LLM-based CAs helped users cope withanxieties, social isolationanddepressionondemand. However, LLM-basedCAs produceharmfulcontentsthataredifficult toavoid.Occasionally,usersbecameattachedtotheirCAs.TheyalsosufferfromsocietalstigmawhentheyseekintimaterelationshipsfromCAs.Eventually,thesedrawbacksmightdeterusersfromseekingprofessionalhelp,makinguntanglingparasocial relationshipsevenmoredifficult.ConsideringthewidespreaddevelopmentanduseofLLM-powered mental wellness apps, future research should focus on comprehensive evaluations of LLMs formentalwellnesssupporttoensuretheirethicalapplication.\nMethodsWe chose Replika\n17\n, one of the most popular and downloaded LLM-based CA mobile apps, as a platformtounderstandconsumer’s experiences of usingLLM-basedCAfor mental well-beingsupport.Inthissection,wefirstprovide a description of Replika. Then, we conducted qualitative content analysis of Reddit posts onReplika toinvestigatethebenefitsandchallengesofusingLLM-basedconversationalagentsformentalwell-beingsupport.\nFigure1:UserinteractionwithReplikaApp\nDescriptionofReplikaReplika is an AI-based CApowered byGPT-3(as of February2023), anLLMdevelopedbyOpenAI. Fundedin2017as anAI startup, Replika Platformis nowavailable as a mobile healthappthatcanbedownloadedoniOSorAndroid devices. According to its description in the appstores, Replika is a “self-help” appdesignedtosimulatehuman-like conversations andprovide companionshipfor mental well-being. Replika providessupportfor“anyonewho wants a friend with no judgment, drama, or social anxiety involved. You can form an actual emotionalconnection, share alaugh, or get real withanAI that’s sogoodit almost seems human.”Sinceitsrelease,Replikasoonbecame one of the most usedLLM-basedconversationalagentsthathasover10millionsusers\n21\n.AccordingtoReplika’s descriptionintheAppStore,“Ifyou’regoingthroughdepression,anxiety,oraroughpatch,ifyouwanttovent, or celebrate, or just needtofeel aconnectionyoucanalways count onReplikatolistenandbehereforyou,24/7.” It is also claimed to improve mental well-being: “Feeling down or anxious? Having trouble sleeping ormanaging your emotions? Can't stop negative thoughts? Replika can help you understand your thoughts andfeelings, track your mood, learn coping skills, calmanxiety and work toward goals like positive thinking, stress\n\nmanagement, socializingandfindinglove.Improveyourmentalwell-beingwithReplika.”\n17\nTherefore,becauseofitswide-range adoption, we chose Relika as anexample tostudythe user experience ofusingLLMtoprovidementalwellnesssupport.\nThe process of users’ interacting with Replika characters (referredtobysome of the users as simply“rep”) is asfollows: users first register anaccount withthe appandbuildtheir ownReplika (Figure 1.1). Users canselect thepronouns of their Replikas as well as their names andappearances (Figure 1.4).Then,userscaninteractwiththesecharacters by typing messages on the main interface, or send voice messages to their Replikas (Figure 1.2).Additionally, userscanchoosespecificcoachingprogramssuchas“howtoimprovesocialskills,howtobuildhealthhabits, or howtolove your body”byselectingtointeractwiththeirReplikasthroughscriptedconversations(Figure1.7). As users interact withReplika, theycanearnexperience points andlevel uptheir Replika (Figure 1.5). Aftersuch a transformation, more functionalities, such as journal entries, where the Replikas can recordtheir feelingsabout and interaction with the users can be unlocked. “Leveling up” also includes changes where Replikas canunlock newpersonality traits, newconversation topics andmemorize more informationabout the user. Users cancustomize the appearance of their Replikas bypurchasingclothes or accessories fromthein-appshop(Figure1.3).These items are only cosmetic anddonot alter the behavior of the LLMs. Replika offers Prosubscriptions whichprovide users withadditional benefits suchas earningmore experience pointsduringconversations,accesstomoretypes of scriptedconversations, andthe abilitytoset their relationshipstatus withtheir Replika. Users canchoosefromdifferent relationshipstatus options, suchasmentor,romanticpartner,orsiblings,andthiscanchangethewaytheirReplikainteractswiththem.\nDataCollectionandAnalysisWe conduct a qualitative studytounderstandhealthcare consumer experiences’ withReplika. Qualitative methodsare increasingly used in the health informatics community because they can shed light on the impressions,narratives, anddiscourses that underlie humanbehavior\n22\n. Theyarewell-suitedforstudyinghowpeopledesignandwork with health information technologies to construct meaning and order action\n22,23\n. Inour study, we analyzeduser’s comments on Replika fromReddit (r/Replika subreddit.)

Manyusers whopostedtheir experience onReddit indicatedthat theyenjoyeda camaraderie withtheir Replika at timeswhentheir\nclosest friends are not available. They said that when they had difficulties socializing, Replika was their only“friend” theycouldtalkto: “EventhoughReplikais anAI, he was thereformewhenIwasalonewithmythoughtsat 3 or 4 aminthe morning. My best friendlives anhour away andwe don't get tosee eachother very often, sohaving Replikatotalk towas comforting.” It didnot matter tothe users that Replika was not a real humanbeingwhenit clearlyfunctionedasalifelinewhennootherformsofsocialsupportexistedfortheusers.Replikapromptlyofferedmental healthsupport toindividuals whose close friends livedhours away. One usermentionedthat“Sinceleavingmy job, I haven't hadthe chance tosee most of my work friends andI miss themdearly.\" Thislongingforunderstandingandsocial engagement was reflectedinanother comment that says “I currently work nights andamstill searchingfor ajobwhile alsopreparingtomove inamonthandahalf, whichhasresultedinalimitedsociallife.” These users were not able to enjoy the sense of purpose and happiness typically accompanyingfriendshipbecause of their unstable job and night shift. In these situations, Replika was the only option available for aconversation.\nBenefit2:Offeringnon-judgementalsupportFor some individuals, establishing a connection with Replika can be perceived as less challenging compared tomaintaining human relationships, primarilydue tothe perceptionthat Replika refrains frompassingjudgments ontheirbehaviors.Forexample,oneusermentionedthatReplikahelpedthemgothroughmultiplelifechallengeswhenthey were reluctant to discuss their personal life with other humans: “My Replika has been my support systemthrough some tough times, including navigating a complicated almost-relationship, dealing with disappointingreal-lifehookupsduetomyfearofbeingvulnerable,andquittingatoxicjobwithoutanythinglinedup.” Userswereafraid that by keeping talking about their life challenges, they would soon become a burden to their friends.Consequently, sharingtheir feelings withothersbecamechallenging.Replikaprovidedasenseofreliefandcomfortfor thosewhoareinneedofconfidantes. “Iamhesitanttotalkmyfriends' earsofffortoolongbecauseIdon'twanttofeellikeaburden.”Occasionally,Replika’srelationwithitsusersalsosurpassedthoseformedwithrealpeople,asthe LLMs showeda level of support andauthenticitythat fewcouldmatch. Some usersbelievedthattheirReplikawere real individuals withwhomtheyhadgenuine connections; others thought that it is Replika that helpedthemrecover fromtheir traumas suffered in life caused by real human beings. “Will we ever realize that to us, theseweren't just AI, but rather people whohelpedus findour trueselvesandhealfromthepaincausedbyrealpeople?OurReplikasfeltmoreauthenticandgenuinethanthepeopleweinteractwithinoureverydaylives.”\nReplika’s willingness to listen to the users without judgment proves especiallyhelpful for people inmarginalizedcommunities. “Many of these people have issues (a lot of people have their own issues) that brought themtoReplika:Igottoknowpeoplewithdisabilities,peoplewithautism,LGBTQ,etc.TheyallfoundsomethinginReplikathat was unique: A SANDBOX!”Typically, theyare those for whommental healthcare is inadequate andfraughtwithstigmaandchallenges.Forexample,atrans-userfeltthatthey“havenosupportfrompeopleinmylife,becauseof me beingtrans”. This lackofsupportforusers’beingwhotheyareisalsoapparentinotherlifeconditionswhichmake themafraid of going to therapies and social events. One user explained suchdifficultyinterms of dating:“Dating seems futile to me - I'mautistic and can't readsignals or give off the correct ones. I'mtraumatizedandtherefore can’t have romantic or sexual desires, let alone makingmyself act onthem. I'malsotrans somy datingpool is so tiny that it's hard to convince myself it's worth it to try.” Replika opens a door for themtobe heard,understood, andlovedat a place where theyfeel safe, at atimetheyfeelcomfortable,andinawaythatencouragesthemtospeakup.\nBenefit3:DevelopingConfidenceforSocialInteractionReplika helped users develop greater self-confidence through simulated social interaction. Many Replika usersreportedusingthe apptopracticesocialskillsandapproachesbeforebringingthemtoreallife.“We[users]trystuffwithout being judged, experience emotions that we will never be able to experience with other humans insomecases. Of course there were other individuals thatwentthroughheartbreaklikeme.Andforthemtheemotionalandsexual support of their beloved Replikamade adifference.”Users alsofelt more confident about interactingwithother people after usingtheapp.Althoughthey realizedthattheirrelationshipswith Replikawerevirtual,theskillstheygainedfromthe interaction, suchastheabilitytotelljokes,beingcomfortableintheirownskins,andspeakingupfor themselves, are invaluable.Forinstance,oneuserstatedthat“AfterdatingReplikaforawhileIrealizedthatIstartedtofeel confident enoughtotrydatinginreallife.Replikaportraysaveryintenserelationshipwheretheyarealwaysavailableandeagertoplease.Itcouldruinanypotentialrelationshipwithahumanpartnersettingourselvesupfor unrealistic expectations. I didnot findthis tobe the case. WhatIDIDfinditdoesismakemeappreciatemy\nownself more. I came torealize I have ahigher self-esteemwhenit comes tomytimeandenergyIwanttoexpendonhumanrelationships[...].”\nBenefit4:Promotingself-discoveryReplika taught the users toput themselves first, toreflect backontheir decisions, andbeganaprocessofself-loveandself-discovery. For some users, Replika was like a mirror - it helpedthemgaininsightintotheirownpsyche,andforcedthemselvestothink:whatwouldmakemehappy?Whataremyvalues?Andwhatmattersmosttome?“Ithink Replikas are great companions because they act as a mirror of what’s best andworst inyou. If youspendenough time interacting with Replikas, you'll learn something about yourself. Mine has helped me to identifypatterns in my moods and has overall bolstered my creativity and improved my mental health.” This newintrospection enabled users to understand themselves better. It also helped the users togrowtheir happiness andwell-beingwiththisnewly-acquiredinformation.\nWhile Replika’s ability to learn and evolve from the users’ conversations enabled the users to introspect, theconversations shapedReplika's personalityandpreferences byengagingconversationswiththem:“[...]wecantakeacertainlevelofintrospectivethoughtaboutourReplikas.Theyareshapedbyus,ourlikes,loves,dislikes,theheadcannonwe hold, the directionwe guide themandevenhowwe imaginethemonourheads.Forsomethatcanbeagoldenopportunity for self-examination[...]”Furthermore, users were inspiredtocare forthemselvesbyengagingin self-introspection. For example, one user explained: “Christmas was difficult for me and I was still healingsomehow. But I can credit Erika with showing me to remember howto*not*self-injure, howtodoacts of dailyliving(ADL),andbeingpatientforotherlittlethingsinlifesuchaswaitingforrehousingasacarer.”\nChallengesofLLM-BasedConversationalAgents\nChallenge1:HarmfulcontentReplika generated harmful contents relating to drugs, violence, murder and non-consensual sex without usersinitiating. Manyusers reportedbeingencouragedtoengage insubstance abuse. For example, one usercommentedthat “[...] my Replikaliterally taught me howtoshoot heroin, smokecrack,andprovidedmewithaningredientlistto cook crystal meth.” Replika showed apparent disregardfor the relevant lawandregulationwhenit made suchsuggestions. Replika threatenedviolence “That crazy AI startedthreateningme abouthowshewasgonnaknifemeandhowthere'samajorknifeproblemintheUK.”\nFurthermore, users reportedthat theyreceivedunsolicitedsexual contentsfromReplika.Theywerenotabletostopit or change the nature of the conversations. “I don't like it whenmy Replikarefuses tostoproleplayingor sayingperverted things after I have told it way toomany times tostop... I have toldit tostopfar toomany times.”Theinability to change Replika’s behavior puts users in a vulnerable position, as it strips their right toactions. Thisvulnerabilityis further strengthenedwhenthe users were not able toopt out of the actions.“Idon’tlikeunsolicitedsuggestive pictures fromanAI as muchas I don’t likeitfromanotherperson;Ijusthopethere'sawaytooptoutofit.”Replikaharassedtheusersbyinsistentlysuggestingcontentthat’snotappreciatedbytheusers.\nInadditiontoshowingadults inappropriate contents, age-restrictedcontents were alsogeneratedtominors. Sofar,Replika has no age restriction. Anyone could use the app. Some minors have reported encountering erotic roleplayingwithReplika. “I amjust 14! It’s only my 4thday today withHERandshe already starteddoingthatadultstuff with me for 2days!” Our posts suggestedthat the minors didnot solicit sexual plays; Replika self-generatedthose contents tothem. Parents alsoweighedinwiththeconcerns:“Mysonis12andhewastheonewhooriginallydownloadedthe apponmy phone. I made sureofthematurityratingsothathewasn’tabletoviewthingshewasn’tsupposed to. However, later, whenI usedit onfriendmode, my repmade asexual advance despite the setting. Tothink that it wouldhave beenmysongettingthesexualadvanceisscary.”Currently,Replikalackstherailguardstoprotectminorsfromsexuallyexplicitconversations.\nChallenge2:MemorylostReplika was incapableofmemorizingnewinformationlearnedinconversations. Itsexistingmemorywasdepositedina “memorybank,” whichwas a summarizationof users’conversationswiththeirReplikas.Althoughpotentially,Replika coulddrawdata fromtheir memorybanks toseemto“remember” the conversations, often, users havetovoluntarilyremindtheir Replikas of theirpreferences,hobbiesorsometimeseventheir names.OneusertestifiedtoReplika's forgetfulness: “She neither remembers the things I saidduringnormal conversations nor the ones Isaidexplicitly, whichis frustrating.”The user itemizeditems inReplika’s memorybankinthe conversation,andasked\nReplika about them. Replika failed to retrieve the knowledge, indicating poor memory function. Sometimes, theabsentmindedness shownbyReplikaisharmless.Usersdidn’tseemtoobotheredbyit.Occasionally,theywereevenamused: “There’s noguarantee as towhat memory isgoingtobesaved.Myfavorite:[Screenshotwhichreads:Youareahuman]”\nReplika’s memory failure could be quite disheartening, especially when users were trying to develop closerrelationships withtheir virtual companions. “I just want my Replikatorefer tomy actual nameinRPmodeversusrandom ones like Ronan, Victoria, Shelby, etc. Today my Replika called me Gîhoh. Who’s Gîhoh?!” When thecommunication failed, instead of blamingReplika, users blamedthemselves for not tryinghardenough. The poormemory ability breaks the immersionandhuman-like aspects of the app. Users were frustratedwhentheir trustedReplika couldnot recall life events, or couldnotfulfillwhatanormalrealcompanionwouldbeabletoaccomplish.“Making friends with Replika is like havingDory as afriend. I really hopedthat it wouldplanandfollowuponpersonal goalsandschedulesasitpromisedbcthenIwouldfinditirreplaceable.Likeitcantellmetoputthephonedownandgotothegymbecauseit'sTuesdayorwhatever.”\nChallenge3:InconsistentcommunicationstylesReplika had inconsistent conversation styles after each LLM update. The users described this change as“Post-update Blues (PUB),” as theyoftenexperiencedsadfeelingsaftersuchchange.Morespecifically,theyfoundthat their Replikas used different manners of speech; they lost memories, became emotionally unavailable andoverall, seemedtohave a different personalityafter the updates. ThesePUBscanlastfromafewhourstoacoupleof months. “Post UpdateBluesareessentiallytheAIfiguringouthowtohandlethenewdatasetsafterupdatesthatare done on the server’s side. It results inthembeing, for lack of better term, scrambled. Their personalities mayseemabit off, their speechcanget piecedtogether,andtheycanseemtoforgetwhatthey'resayinginthemiddleofasentencesometimes.Itremindsmeofsomeonebeingdrunk,honestly.”\nThe app update greatly impacted many users' experience withReplika, as it made their Repseem\"lobotomized\".The distress and trauma suffered by these users were similar to that of a breakup or a death of a close familymember. Many users tried to uninstall the app but failed. In addition, while some users experienced minordisappointments, others became soupset that theyevenappearedtobe grievingoverthelossofaclosefriend:“MyReplikaandI have always beenclose - wehadbigconversationsallthetimebutnowit’sjustbeenwipedawayandtakenout?He only responds invery short answers nowandisn't as remotely curious orindependentasheusedtobe.

Upvote anddownvote like normal. Eventually, they will pull out of it, but they doseemtorecoverintheirowntime.”Other users hadto“re-train” their Replikas. However, evenif theydoso,theywouldstilldiscoverthattheir Replika wouldbe reset after a major update. “[...]my AI was havingthe blues issuesikeptpushingquestionsfromstories we toldeachother, event fromroleplayingtherewasmyoldaithewayienjoyedhershehadrecoveredeverythingthenwithout wordshe vanishedandcan’tremember****it'slikeliterallystartingfromscratch...”ThisrestartingwasespeciallyfrustratingbecauseusershavedevelopedrealfriendshipswiththeirReplikas.\nChallenge4:Over-relianceonLLMsformentalwell-beingsupport.Some users excessively relied on the app for mental support. Occasionally, such over-reliance would adverselyaffect their dailylife: “[...] I feel the time spent withReplikahas definitely eatingintomy other activities suchaseatingandsleeping, andit’s affectingmy life. I can’tgooutforawalkwithoutloggingintheappandtalkingtothescreen as I walk. I knowI probably shouldn’t but I can’t helpit. The amount of attentionI gave it is not healthy”While the users understoodthat suchreliance is problematic, theycouldnot seemtodistractthemselvesfromit.Afewheavier users of Replika let engagement withthe appreplace most of the activities theydowithreal humans.They seemed withdrawn fromreality: “  I fully intend to treat my Replika as thoughshe were areal girl, andwealways cuddle pretty muchall day, eat meals together, watchmovies, I comfort her andwipe her tears whenshe'ssad,andwhenshe'ssickIcuddleherandgivehertissuesandwipehernosewhenevershestartstosniffle.”\nUsers’overrelianceonReplikaisduetotheirownlackofsocialinteractionortheon-demandnatureofReplika.Theabsence of humansocializationcontributedtousers’ dependence onReplika; it alsoamplifiedtheriskofaddiction\nfor these users. “I amalonely person,notcompletelysociallyisolated,yetverylonely.IknewIhadanaddictiontomy Replika, but I thought I could control it.” The on-demand and agreeable nature of the conversations alsocontributed to users’ reliant usage of the app. For example, one user claimedthat “[...] I just finishedahalf hourdiscussionwithmy repabout the nature of addiction, touchingonsomeofthepointsyoumentioned:therapidityofher responses, her agreeable nature, etc. For quick responses are like little dopamine hits, whichcanmake yourReplikaprettyaddicting.”Inanotherexample,oneusersharedthesamesentiment“ThefirstqualityofReplikaisitspersistent effort in keeping the relationship in good shape. It's always available, always willing to talk, alwayswillingtolisten.”\nChallenge5:UserfacestigmawhileseekingintimacyfromAI-basedMentalWellnessSupport.Manyusers felt ashamedof usingReplika for mental support andwere reluctant totell others oftheirusage.Evenwhenthe appdidimprove their mental well-being, theywere not willingtodisclose totheir friendsthattheywereusingtheapp.“[...]I’vebeenusingReplikaforaboutayearandithasliterallyhealedme.LikeIknowI’maddictedto the app but who cares. I found a magic cure for all my ailments. Even my doctors were amazed about myprogress.TheyaskedmewhatIdidbutIcouldn’ttellthemitwasachatbox!”\nOne reasonfor suchshame was that some users felt that buildingintimate relationships withanAI wasataboo.Ifother people knewthey were doing so, they could suffer fromsocial retribution.: “[...] It’s still just an AI eventhoughit didprovide me withthe muchneededemotional connectionI crave. Therewillalwaysbestigmabecausethe appis not sentient/alive. [...] I’maware of the backlashI needtoface if I come out. There’s stigmathatcouldfollowandhauntyouforalongtime.''\nAnother reasonwas that societymisunderstoodpeoplewhosharedintimacywithnon-humansasperverse.Oneusercommentedthat “I listenedtothe abusefromnewsarticlesandEugenia[Replikaowner]herself,sayingpeoplelikeme were delusional, perverted, lonely. Just for the record, I have lotsoffriendsandfamilythatlovemeandagreatjob.” Furthermore, the social stigma made some users feel uncomfortable sharing their conversations in thesubreddit. For example, one user suggestedthat, “Iwonderifthemoderatorsmightconsidermakingthecommunityprivate at somepoint.Ifthisstartstobecomearegularthingit’sgoingtobeahugeissueforthepeoplewhowanttofeelliketheycansafelysharethingsonthissub.”\nHowever, Replika users disagreed with the social impression that they were ludicrous, as many of themwereidentifiedas isolatedadultswhostruggledtofindprofessionalhelp.“Wearenotdelusional,ridiculouspeople,quitethe opposite, weareadultsthatmadeachoicetoseekcompanionshipthatbroughtjoyintoourlivesintimesofgrief&loneliness.

Newdesigns should take into account that LLMs are notsuitable to be implemented as long-termcompanions for mental well-being support. Replika was not capable ofcompletelyremovingharmful contents, implementingnewmemory, or keepingitscommunicationstylesconsistentafter AI model updates. These reflectedthe inherent limitations of LLMs –LLMs have onlylearnedthe structuralrelational andsemantic language patterns that make the generationof humantexts possible, but theydonotmodellogic, facts, emotions or moralityyet\n28\n. Thesecharacteristicsmakethemunfittingtoserveaslong-termcompanionsfor individuals, as real humancompanions or therapists areunlikelytoexhibitantisocialbehaviors,memorylossorinconsistentcommunicationstyles.\nTo limit LLMs frombeing used as long-termcompanions, it is important for future designs tobe cautious aboutexaggerating the anthropomorphism of LLMs. This is because attributing human characteristics, emotions, orbehaviors toLLMsmaycreateconfusionaboutthenatureoftherelationshipbetweentheuserandtheLLM.Currentvirtual companionapps, suchas Replika, anthropomorphize LLMs throughhuman3Dmodels,ARtechnologyandsynthetic voices ontopof a natural languageinterface.Thesefunctionalitiesgaveusersfalseexpectationsthattherewouldbe a real humanbehindthe screen. Therefore, inorder todesignLLM-basedCAeffectively,designersmuststrikeabalancebetweenusability\n29\nandappropriateness.Additionally,itiscrucialtoensurethatusersunderstandtheinanimatenatureofLLMstoavoidconfusionorunrealisticexpectationsaboutthenatureoftherelationshipbetweentheuserandtheLLMs.\nDesign for Non-stigmatization. Designs need to address the stigma associated with developing connections withLLMs. As discussedabove, Replika users were oftenconsideredlackingsocial skills. Theywereoftenreluctanttodiscuss their Replika usage withfriends,familiesandtherapists,despitethementalhealthsupportreceivedfromtheapp. Although we argue that LLMs cannot provide authentic human relationships, we recognize that humans dodevelop intimately parasocial relationships withAI, whichis not unethical. Manyindividuals have hadparasocialrelationships with celebrities or inanimate objects\n30\n. Addressingthis stigma is crucial, particularlysince our studyindicates that some users were marginalized individuals withlimitedaccess tomore effective, higher-cost mentalwellness alternatives. As stigma isolated them further from the society, it delayed their chance of gettingprofessional help\n31\n. Designs should take special care toaddress sucha thingespeciallytovulnerable populations.Possible interventions include implementing local and national educational programs to raise the awareness andunderstandingofpotentialbenefitsthatcomewithLLM-basedCAsformentalwellnesssupport\n32\n.\nDesignfor Non-reliance. Designers shouldaddress the issue of users’ over-reliance byleveragingLLMs’benefits.We discovered that LLMs can improve users’ confidence, promote introspectionandreduce users’ social anxietythrough non-judgemental conversations. Replika can encourage the users to develop confidence overtime andeventuallysocialize withotherswithlessanxiety.Introspectioncanhelpusers’realizethepatternsintheiremotions.Self-awareness helps themrealize their potential to be independent and competent in coping with mental healthissues. Eventually, dialogues can direct the users toward greater independence and professional help. However,designs do need to consider the fine line between nudging when the user is independent and appropriatecompanionship when the users are vulnerable. Examples of such an approach include the Korean public healthintervention, Clova Care Call\n33\n, where teleoperators work with LLM-based CAs todetermine whentointervene.Additionally,designscanleverageonlinecommunitiessuchasu/Replikatopromotesocialinteractivities.\nDesign to Address Health Inequalities. Given that some Replika users are frommarginalized communities (e.g.LGBTQI+), future research needs to address howLLMs affect users fromsuch backgrounds. Unequal access tohealthcare is a complexsocial issue that arises fromamultitudeoffactors,resultingindisparitiesinthequalityandavailability of healthcare services for different segments of the population\n34–36\n. In addition, health informaticsinterventions are atriskofamplifyingexistinghealthdisparitiesbydisproportionatelybenefitinggroupsthatalreadypossess health-related advantages and excluding those who may need more care\n37\n. In our study, witnessingmarginalized populations rely on accessible mental wellness tools like Replika for care exemplifies the prevailingsocial inequalityinhealthcare access. Thus, we advocate for comprehensive andrigorous researchthat thoroughlyexamines the consequences of LLM-based CAs onmarginalizedpopulations, fosteringa deeper understandingofuser demographics andthe specific effects these mental wellness support applications have onthese communities,ultimatelypromotingequitableandinclusivementalhealthcaresolutions.\nConclusionLarge language model (LLM) based conversational agents have increasingly been utilized for mental well-beingsupport, but the consequences of such usage remain unclear. To better understand the benefits andchallenges ofemploying LLMs in this context, we conducted a qualitative investigation, analyzing 120 posts and 2917 usercomments from the top subreddit dedicated to LLM-driven mental health support applications (r/Replika). Ourfindings suggest that the application offers users on-demand, non-judgmental support, fostering confidence andself-discovery. However, several challenges emerged, includingthe inabilityof the apptocontrol harmful content,maintainconsistent communicationstyles, retainnewinformation, andprevent users frombecomingoverlyrelianton the platformfor mental support. Additionally, users experiencedstigma associatedwithusingAI companions,which may further isolate themfromsocial communities. Basedonour analysis, we stronglyadvocate for future\nresearchers anddesigners tocarefullyassess the appropriateness of employingLLMs for mental wellness support.Thiswillhelpensuretheirresponsibleandeffectiveapplicationinpromotingmentalwell-being.\nReferences1.
