Empirical\nfine-tuning results, as well as zero- and few-\nshot learning, on 9 benchmarks (5 generation\nand 4 classification tasks covering 4 reasoning\ntypes with diverse event correlations), verify its\neffectiveness and generalization ability.\n1 Introduction\nAn ‘event’, usually a text span composed of a pred-\nicate and its arguments (Zhang et al., 2020b), is\na fine-grained semantic unit to describe the state\nof entities/things (e.g., He looks very worried) and\nhow they act (e.g., I grab his arms). Understanding\nevents and modeling their correlations are funda-\nmental to many reasoning tasks (Bhagavatula et al.,\n2020; Qin et al., 2019), e.g., abductive reasoning,\nstory ending classification and generation, counter-\nfactual reasoning, script reasoning. For instance, in\nthe left example of Figure 1, to generate the miss-\ning event [E] in the given context, it is essential\nto understand that there are four events (‘ it tries\n∗Work is done during internship at Microsoft.\n†Corresponding author.\nContext: \nIt tries the knob but [E], so\nthe creature starts pounding \non the door to break it down.\nParagraph 𝑥:\nIt tries the knob but it’s locked, so \nthe creature starts pounding on …\nAn event mention 𝑒:\nit’s locked\nNegative events { ҧ𝑒}𝑖=1\n𝑀 :\nit’s smoked      he’s gone     …\nOutput: \nit’s locked.\nFigure 1: Left: an example of abductive reasoning which\naims to generate the missing event [E] given correlated events\n(underlined) and connectives (w/ orange) in the context.Right:\na toy example (x, e,{¯e}M\ni=1) of event-rich data for better read-\ning.

However, many\nalgorithms are designed to solve only some specific\ntasks. For example, Qin et al. (2020) propose to\nimprove unsupervised decoding for counterfactual\nand abductive reasoning; Huang et al. (2021) and\nGuan et al. (2019) advance story ending generation\nvia incremental encoding and multi-level graph\nconvolutional networks. Although these works\nshow effectiveness in corresponding applications,\nthey are limited to specific scenarios, and cannot\ngeneralize well to a broad scope of reasoning.\nMeanwhile, some pioneering works follow a re-\ncently arising paradigm to conduct event-based pre-\ntraining for those downstream reasoning tasks (Yu\net al., 2020; Han et al., 2020a; Lin et al., 2020;\nZhou et al., 2021b). However, these solutions have\ntheir own limitations: COMeT (Hwang et al., 2021)\nlearns event correlations from a human-curated\nknowledge graph and thus limits its scalability. Han\net al. (2020a) and Lin et al. (2020) only model tem-\nporal relations and cannot be expanded to other re-\nlations (e.g., causal, contrast). EventBERT (Zhou\net al., 2021b) is proposed for event-based classifi-\n2559\ncations and is thus inapplicable to generation tasks.\nIn this work, we propose a general pre-training\nframework for event-centric reasoning by learning\na Correlation-aware context-to-Event Transformer\n(ClarET) from an event-rich text corpus. We pro-\npose three novel self-supervised objectives, dubbed\nas whole event recovering (WER), contrastive\nevent-correlation encoding and prompt-based event\nlocating, respectively. The first one aims to capture\nevent correlation by recovering a whole event from\nits masked context. The second one enhances the\nrepresentation of the masked event in WER by con-\ntrasting it with the gold event against the negative\nones. The last one is a simplified WER task by\nproviding hints in its prompt and thus facilitates\neffective learning for WER.\nClarET explicitly models event correlations and\ncontributes to various scenarios. From one aspect,\nit covers a variety of correlation types (e.g., causal,\ntemporal, contrast) attributed to correlation type-\nagnostic objectives. From another aspect, it is ap-\nplicable to both generation and classification task\nformulations by its unified structure. Lastly, it high-\nlights event-level correlations and thus is more ef-\nfective for diverse event-centric tasks, e.g., abduc-\ntive, counterfactual and ending reasoning.\nTo evaluate ClarET, we compare it with strong\nbaselines on 9 diverse benchmarks. While ClarET\nis continually pre-trained from BART (Lewis et al.,\n2020) with very limited extra resources, i.e., train-\ning on a small subset of BART-used corpus (i.e.,\n200M out of 2.2T tokens) within 90 GPU hours\n(only 0.13% of 70,000h BART pre-training), it\nachieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on all\n5 generation benchmarks. It also outperforms all\nunified models on 4 classification benchmarks and\nachieves competitive, or even better, accuracy to\nstrong discriminative baselines. We further exhibit\nthat the ClarET provides a good initialization for\ndownstream tasks by zero- and few-shot learning.\n2 Related Work\nUnified Pre-trained Model. A recent trend is\nto pre-train unified (a.k.a. universal or general)\nmodels to boost downstream generation and clas-\nsification tasks, rather than masked language mod-\neling (MLM) only. GPT (Radford et al., 2019) is\nbased on auto-regressive language modeling but\nincompetent in classifications due to unidirectional\ncontextualizing. To remedy this, BART (Lewis\net al., 2020) trains seq2seq models as a text denois-\ning autoencoder with mask-infilling, etc; UniLM\n(Dong et al., 2019) designs advanced self-attention\nmasks in Transformer, leading to a partially auto-\nregressive MLM; GLM (Du et al., 2021) proposes\nan auto-regressive blank-filling objective based on\nTransformer, achieved by bi-/uni-directional atten-\ntion and 2D positional encoding. T5 (Raffel et al.,\n2020) pre-trains a text-to-text Transformer to re-\ncover the masked part of input by decoding. All\nthese general-purpose pre-trained models focus on\nrelatively short-span masking in random, whereas\nwe focus on masking a whole semantic unit (i.e.,\nevent) and propose novel training objectives to\ncircumvent problems in long-span event decod-\ning. Besides, they are also vulnerable to pretrain-\nfinetune inconsistency, leading to inferior event-\ncentric performance.\nTask-specific Models for Event Reasoning.\nMany recent works present task-specific neural\nmodels for various event-centric reasoning types,\nincluding (1) abductive reasoning (Ji et al., 2020;\nDong et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2020), (2) counterfac-\ntual reasoning (Qin et al., 2019, 2020), (3) ending\nreasoning (Guan et al., 2019; Wang and Wan, 2019;\nYao et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2021; Guan et al.,\n2020; Wang et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018; Ding et al.,\n2019; Zhou et al., 2021c; Chaturvedi et al., 2017;\nSrinivasan et al., 2018), (4) incoherence reason-\ning (Mori et al., 2020). However, these methods\nare designed for the specific reasoning scenarios\nbased on task-specific models so hardly generalize\nto other scenarios. In contrast, we aim to pre-train\na general event-centric model for generalizing to\nvarious scenarios.\nEvent-centric Pre-training. With similar scopes,\nmany works focus on event-centric pre-training\nto promote event-related tasks as ‘event’ is a self-\ncontained semantic unit and also an entry of com-\nmonsense reasoning. One paradigm is to pre-train\non corpora without human-labeling. Some methods\nfocus on more specific aspects of events and their\ncorrelations. DEER (Han et al., 2020b) performs\ntemporal and event masking predictions for tempo-\nral relations. Lin et al. (2021) propose to recover a\ntemporally-disordered or event-missing sequence\nfor temporal and causal relations. Wang et al.\n(2021) use AMR structure to design contrastive ob-\njectives for the event detection task. However, they\nare not general enough to various event reasoning\ntasks. In contrast, CoCoLM (Yu et al., 2020) learns\n2560\nan event-level MLM to generalize more. Event-\nBERT (Zhou et al., 2021b) states the ineffective-\nness of event-level MLM and exploits hard nega-\ntives via contrasting, contributing much to down-\nstream multi-choice tasks. However, these methods\nare only competent in discriminative tasks. The\nother paradigm is based on supervised pre-training\non similar tasks and then performs knowledge trans-\nfer, e.g., COMeT (Hwang et al., 2021), UnifiedQA\n(Khashabi et al., 2020) and UNICORN (Lourie\net al., 2021), but they require human-curated data.\nEvent-rich Corpus. Although raw corpora are\nviewed as off-the-shelf pre-training resources, a\nkey question is how to mine event-rich examples.\nHere, ‘event-rich’ denotes that each example con-\ntains various events and entails adequate contexts\nto support event reasoning via either explicit or im-\nplicit event-correlation. This is crucial to learning\nevent-correlations and reducing unnecessary over-\nheads. Except for human-curated resources (e.g.,\nATOMIC (Sap et al., 2019) and ConceptNet (Speer\net al., 2017)), event-rich corpora are also mined via\nautomatic schemes. ASER (Zhang et al., 2020b)\nbuilds an event-based graph, where each node is an\nevent extracted from a text and the relation of an\nevent pair is predicted by a PDTB model. In con-\ntrast, EventBERT (Zhou et al., 2021b) operates on\npure text so filters out correlation-scarce contexts\nand extracts verb-rooted events. Besides, it offers\nevent sampling methods for hard negatives. We\nadopt this data processing method as both pure-text\nexamples and hard negatives are prerequisites of\ngeneric and robust pre-training.\n3 Methodology\n3.1 Prerequisite: Event-rich Corpus\nIn this work, we directly adopt event-rich data min-\ning and negative sampling methods from Zhou et al.\n(2021b) but focus our contributions on enlarging\napplication scope of event-centric tasks and over-\ncoming challenges raised in the new scope.\nEvent-rich Data Mining. To mine event-rich\ndata from raw corpus, we employ a story corpus,\nBOOK CORPUS (Zhu et al., 2015), and take a two-\nstep procedural (i.e., ‘ filter’ and ‘extraction’). It\nfilters out correlation-scarce paragraphs according\nto existence of connectives (i.e., discourse relation\nkeywords, e.g., however, while). Then, it highlights\nthe event spans in the filtered paragraphs byextract-\ning verb-rooted sub-trees in dependency trees of\nthe paragraphs. With a filtered paragraph x, we\nbuild each example as (x, e) where e is an event\nmention in x. We obtain 200M tokens (out of 1B in\nBOOK CORPUS ) in 3.9M filtered paragraphs. For\nclear notations, we denote a text piece as a lower\ncase letter (e.g., e). It is tokenized into a sequence\nas a bold (e.g., e = [e1, e2, . . .]), where a letter w/\nsubscript t is the t-th token in the sequence.\nNegative Event Sampling. Following Zhou et al.\n(2021b), we build a pool of events from the whole\ncorpus and then retrieve negative events by three\nheuristic schemes. Given an event e in (x, e), we\nsample its negative event, ¯e, in light of lexicon-\nbased (20% time), PoS-based (60% time) or in-\ndomain (20% time) retrieval. Consequently, given\nan event e, we sample M negative events, i.e.,\n{¯e}M\ni=1. Figure 1 (right) shows an integrated in-\nstance (x, e,{¯e}M\ni=1) of the event-rich corpus1.\n3.2 Pre-training Objectives\nWe first present whole event recovering as a back-\nbone pre-training objective in §3.2.1. After iden-\ntifying incompetence of the simple backbone, we\npropose two other objectives in §3.2.2 and §3.2.3.\nAn overview of the objectives is shown in Figure 2.\n3.2.1 Whole Event Recovering\nFor the objective of whole event recovering (WER),\nit is straightforward to leverage an encoder-decoder\nstructure, where a masked context is passed into the\nencoder to generate the missing part by decoding.\nSpecifically, given an evente in a paragraph x, we\nmask out e from x at the encoder side and then\ngenerate e at the decoder side, i.e.,\np(e|x/{e}; θ) =\nY\nt\np(et|e<t, x/{e}; θ), (1)\nwhere θ denotes parameters and x/{e} denotes re-\nplacing e in x with one special token [M]. We\nestimate Eq. (1) by the Transformer sequence-to-\nsequence (seq2seq) structure (Vaswani et al., 2017).\nFirst, we apply the Transformer encoder to x/{m}\nfor contextual embeddings for all tokens in x/{m}:\nH(enc)=Trans-Enc(x/{e}; θ(enc)) ∈ Rd×n, (2)\nwhere n is the number of tokens in x/{e}. Then,\nthe Transformer decoder is employed to predict all\ntokens e of the event e in a recurrent manner, i.e.,\n˜yt = Trans-Dec(e<t, H(enc); θ(dec))∈R|V|, (3)\n1Experimental codes are released at https://github.\ncom/yczhou001/ClarET.\n2561\nFigure 2: An overview of self-supervised objectives for our\nCorrelation-aware context-to-Event Transformer (ClarET).\nwhere V denotes token vocabulary and ˜yt is the\npredicted categorical distribution over V. Lastly,\nthe training objective is defined as a maximum\nlikelihood estimation. Its loss function is written as\nL(wer) = −\nX\n(x,e)\n1\n|e|\nX|e|\nt=1\nlog ˜yt[y = et], (4)\nwhere ‘yt[y = et]’ denotes fetching the probability\nof the t-step gold token et ∈ e from ˜yt.\nThis objective is similar to span recovering\nschema (Raffel et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2020) but\ndiffers in that (i) each masked span is an event, i.e.,\nan integrated semantic unit, so much longer (up\nto 22 tokens and see Figure 4 for length distribu-\ntion), and (ii) only one event is masked out from\nthe context to facilitate event-correlation modeling\nbetween the event and its contexts.\nIntuitively, the success of Eq. (1) requires to\ncapture correlations between the masked event and\nremaining contexts but two major problems arise\ndue to WER with long event-level masking spans:\n(1) Implicit Event-correlation: The model recov-\ners an event based solely on token-level concur-\nrence as in a conditional language model (e.g., T5\nand BART), regardless of the rich event-level corre-\nlations between the events in context x/{e} and the\nmasked event e. Such a correlation-implicit model\nwould achieve inferior performance on downstream\nevent-centric correlation reasoning tasks.\n(2) Learning Difficulty: As the masked event\nis an integrated, self-contained, semantic unit, it\nis difficult for the conditional generation model\nto recover the whole event due to a lack of local\ncontexts. As a result, the model cannot effectively\nlearn from the long masked spans, which has been\nempirically proved in autoencoding MLM models.\nTo alleviate the two problems above, we propose\ntwo other novel self-supervised objectives in the\nfollowing. Briefly, we present contrastive event-\ncorrelation encoding to enhance correlations be-\ntween contexts and events, and prompt-based event\nlocating to reduce generation difficulty.\n3.2.2 Contrastive Event-correlation Encoding\nFor the implicit event-correlation problem, an intu-\nitive solution is to explicitly highlight the correla-\ntion from the masked context to the missing event\nat the encoder side. To achieve this, we resort to\ncontrastive learning to enhance the encoder-side\nrepresentation of the masked event by contrasting\nit with the embedding of the gold event mention e\nagainst those of negative ones ¯e. Particularly, we\nfirst derive the embedding of e and ¯e independently\nvia the Transformer encoder in Eq.(2), i.e.,\nc = Pool(Trans-Enc([CLS] + e; θ(enc))), (5)\n¯c = Pool(Trans-Enc([CLS] + ¯e; θ(enc))), (6)\nwhere [CLS] is a special token prefixed to each\nevent mention, and Pool(·) denotes using the con-\ntextual embedding of [CLS] to represent the\nwhole event. Then, we enhance h[m], the con-\ntextual representation of [M] in x/{e} from H(enc)\nin Eq.(2), by contrasting it with c against ¯c, i.e.,\nL(cee)=max(0,λ+d(h[m],c)−d(h[m],¯c)), (7)\nwhere d(·, ·) denotes a distance metric of two vec-\ntors, which is Euclidean distance in this work. As a\nresult, the encoder-side correlation-aware represen-\ntation h[m] also offers a straightforward pathway\nto transmit event-level information to decoding so\nmitigates the learning difficulty to some extent.\n3.2.3 Prompt-based Event Locating\nAs for learning difficulty problem, we also pro-\npose a prompt-based event locating objective to\nreduce generative difficulty by providing hints in\nthe prompt. The basic idea is to simplify WER ob-\njective as an extractive generation task to locate and\ncopy a candidate/hint from the prompt, which aims\nat improving learning effectiveness. To this end,\nwe present two prompt-based generation schemas\nin the following.\n2562\nCorrect Event Selection. Inspired by advances\nof prompt-based multi-choice question answering,\nwe present correct event selection schema to select\nthe gold evente against negative ones{¯e}M\ni=1 based\non the contexts x/{e}. Given an event-masked para-\ngraph x/{e} suffixed with several candidate events\n{¯e}M\ni=1 containing the gold masked one e, it aims\nto generate the masked event e back, i.e.,\nˆx(ces) = x/{e} + Options: (a) e1; (b) e2; ··· ,\nwhere [e1, e2, . . .] is a random permutation of\n[e, {¯e}M\ni=1] in case of position bias. We use a ran-\ndom permutation as all candidates are assigned\nwith distinct position embeddings during contex-\ntualizing, and a fixed permutation of gold events\nwill result in a learning shortcut (position bias) to\ndegrade the model. Thus, similar to Eq.(1), we can\ndefine its formula as p(e|ˆx(ces); θ).\nWrong Event Tagging. The other schema is\nwrong event tagging to find the wrong event in\na corrupted paragraph, similar to incoherence rea-\nsoning. Thus, we re-write the encoder input as\nˆx(wet) = x/{e}&∪{¯e} + Event: [M] is wrong,\nwhere x/{e}&∪{¯e} denotes replacing the gold event\ne in x with a negative ¯e ∈ {¯e}M\ni=1. Thus, we can de-\nfine the formula of this objective as p(¯e|ˆx(wet); θ).\nBased on the two formulas above, we define the\nprompt-based event locating objective as\nL(pel) =\nX\n(x,e)\n− 1\n|e|\nX\nt\nlog p(et|e<t, ˆx(ces); θ)\n− 1\n|¯e|\nX\nt\nlog p(¯et|¯e<t, ˆx(wet); θ), (8)\nwhere θ = {θ(enc), θ(dec)}, ¯e is sampled in {¯e}M\ni=1.\n3.3 Model Pre-training and Fine-tuning\nSelf-supervised Pre-training. The final loss to\npre-train our ClarET is a linear combination of the\nthree losses above from Eq.(4, 7, 8), i.e.,\nL = L(wer) + L(cee) + L(pel). (9)\nWe set the margin λ in Eq.(7) to 0.5 w/o tuning.\nSupervised Downstream Fine-tuning. For gen-\neration tasks, we simply leverage the formula in\nEq.(1) to establish fine-tuning objectives. For dis-\ncriminative (e.g., multi-choice) tasks, we can either\nformulate all tasks into generation as in GPT/T5\nor fine-tune with classifying heads as in BART.\nWith pilot experiments, we found the latter one can\nachieve better performance and adopted it.\n3.4 Comparing to Similar Works\nWhile we adopt the same data processing in Event-\nBERT (Zhou et al., 2021b) and share a similar mo-\ntivation to learn an event-centric pre-trained model,\nwe expand the scope from ‘discriminative-only’ in\nEventBERT into ‘unified’ by our context-to-event\nTransformer for a broad spectrum of scenarios.\nSuch an expansion is non-trivial since new chal-\nlenges arise in the unified formulation. Compared\nto the inefficient ‘ event-backfilling and contextu-\nalizing’ paradigm in EventBERT, our model can\nexplicitly and effectively learn event-level corre-\nlations between contexts and events by our novel\ncontrastive and prompt-based objectives. More-\nover, COMeT (Bosselut et al., 2019; Hwang et al.,\n2021) is also a conditional generation model but\nfocuses on triple-level commonsense reasoning –\ngiven (head event, relation) to generate tail events,\nwhose motivation, however, is orthogonal to ours.\nTherefore, we focus on a different motivation or\nscope, not to mention evaluation formulations.\n4 Experiments\nThis section begins with descriptions of down-\nstream datasets and experimental setups.\nDownstream Datasets. We conduct extensive\nevaluations on 9 datasets for 9 downstream tasks,\ni.e., 5 generation and 4 classification tasks. Gen-\neration tasks include abductive commonsense rea-\nsoning on ART (αNLG) (Bhagavatula et al., 2020),\ncounterfactual story generation on TIMETRA VEL\n(Qin et al., 2019), story ending generation (Guan\net al., 2019), commonsense story generation (Guan\net al., 2020), and event process completion on APSI\n(Zhang et al., 2020a). Classification tasks include\nscript reasoning on MCNC (Li et al., 2018), ab-\nductive commonsense reasoning on ART (αNLI)\n(Bhagavatula et al., 2020), narrative incoherence\ndetection on ROCStories (Mori et al., 2020), and\nstory cloze test (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016). Please\nrefer to Appendix C for their details.\nPre-training Setups. Instead of learning from\nscratch, we perform continual pre-training from\nBART-large (Lewis et al., 2020) due to limited\ncomputation resources. The batch size and number\nof training steps are 1152 and 160k. The model is\ntrained by Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) w/ learn-\ning rate of 1e-5 and warmup proportion of 0.03.\nThe gradient clip, dropout rate and weight decay\nare 1.0, 0.1 and 0.01.

Hence, ClarET\nwith zero newly introduced corpus and relatively\nnegligible computing overhead makes great lifts\nand preserves fair comparisons with baselines.\nFine-tuning Setups. For finetuning, we train the\nmodel with an Adam w/ learning rate of 1e-5 and\nwarmup proportion of 0.06. The dropout rate, batch\nsize and weight decay are 0.1, 32 and 0.01. For\ngenerative downstream tasks, we take BLEU- N\n(B-N) (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE-L (R-L)\n(Lin, 2004) and BERTScore (BERT) (Zhang et al.,\n2020c) as the evaluation metrics, while the accu-\nracy (ACC) is taken for classification tasks. Each\nfine-tuning runs with seeds 2, 10 and 1234, and we\nevaluate the best dev model on the test set.\n4.1 Main Evaluation\nFine-tuning for Generation. As shown in Ta-\nble 1, our proposed ClarET achieves SoTA perfor-\nmance across all generation tasks. For instance,\nClarET increases the ROUGE-L score by 2.3 ab-\nsolute value for abductive reasoning. The supe-\nrior performance of ClarET on the benchmarks\ndemonstrates that it can model event-level corre-\n2564\nMethod B-4 R-L BERT\nGPT (Qin et al., 2019) 1.25 18.26 59.50\nGPT2-S (Qin et al., 2019) 1.28 20.27 59.62\nGPT2-M (Qin et al., 2019) 1.51 19.41 60.17\nZero-Shot-Ranked (Qin et al., 2020) 2.26 25.81 60.07\nBART-large (Lewis et al., 2020) 7.08 30.60 61.58\nDELOREAN (Qin et al., 2020) 21.35 40.73 63.36\nClarET (ours) 23.75 43.03 63.93\nTable 3: Zero-shot results on generative Counterfactual Story.\nlation more effectively via few steps of continual\npre-training and provide a general solution for a\nvariety of event-centric correlation reasoning tasks.\nFine-tuning for Classification. Table 2 lists re-\nsults on 4 classification tasks. We find ClarET per-\nforms better than all task-specific models and uni-\nfied pre-trained models with 2%-4% improvement.\nIt achieves competitive accuracy to strong discrim-\ninative models, e.g., the gap between ClarET and\nEventBERT is ∼0.15 for narrative incoherence de-\ntection and story cloze test. However, EventBERT\nis a RoBERTa-based competitor using the identi-\ncal pre-training corpus. Its pre-training follows\n“event-backfilling and contextualizing” (similar to\nmulti-choice QA), which has a small gap to down-\nstream classification tasks for strong performance\nbut brings two drawbacks. Firstly, its pre-training\nis slow due to repeat contextualizing over para-\ngraphs, leading to 5.6× longer GPU hours than\nours. In addition, its discriminative paradigm lim-\nits it specifically to classifications, regardless of\nwide generation tasks. The results show ClarET is\non par with the discriminative-only EventBERT\non classifications. This is non-trivial given the\nlarge formulation gap between our generative pre-\ntraining objectives and downstream multi-choice-\nstyle classification tasks, and attributed to our effec-\ntive event-correlation learning. In summary, these\nresults show ClarET serves as a unified pre-trained\nmodel for event-centric generation and classifica-\ntion tasks.\n4.2 Quantitative Analysis\nZero-shot Learning. It is essential to verify if the\ntargeted information was learned and retained by\na pre-trained model. Compared to MLM, our gen-\nerative recovering model is inherently applicable\nto event-centric multi-choice and generative formu-\nlations. For generation tasks, we apply Eq.(1) to\ngenerate answers. As shown in Table 3, ClarET\nachieves the best performance and outperformsDE-\nMethod ACC (%)\nRandom 20.00\nRoBERTa-large (Zhou et al., 2021b) 20.09\nDeBERTa-xlarge (Zhou et al., 2021b) 20.31\nBART-large (Lewis et al., 2020) 21.72\nEventBERT (Zhou et al., 2021b) 30.79\nClarET (ours) 32.15\nTable 4: Zero-shot results on discriminative Script Reasoning.\nNote that MLM-style models are evaluated by autoregression-\nlike operation (Zhou et al., 2021b).\n10 20 30 40 50\nTraining data size on CS (%)\n82\n83\n84\n85\n86BLEU-4\nClarET\nBART (Full data)\n10 20 30 40 50\nTraining data size on SR (%)\n58\n60\n62\n64Accuracy (%)\nClarET\nBART (Full data)\nFigure 3: Few-shot learning results compared with the basic\nmodel, BART-large, on generation (Counterfactual Story, CS)\nand classification (Script Reasoning, SR).\nLOREAN (which adapts auto-regression for coun-\nterfactual reasoning). For classification tasks, we\napply Eq.(1) to each option for its perplexity and\nselect the option with minimum. As shown in Ta-\nble 4, ClarET surpasses previous models and beats\nthe discriminative-only event-centric model, Event-\nBERT. Besides, the general-purpose pre-trained\nmodels perform nearly random guesses due to their\nincompetence in long-span event discrimination.\nFew-shot Learning. Since our model reduces\npretrain-finetune inconsistency for event-centric\ntasks and provides a good initialization for down-\nstream fine-tuning, it is also interesting to see few-\nshot performance by scaling down training data.\nAs shown in Figure 3, ClarET achieves similar per-\nformance to strong baselines with only 10%-30%\nof training data for fine-tuning.\nAblation study. To measure the contribution\nof each objective to the final fine-tuning results,\nwe conduct an ablation study on both generation\nand classification in Table 5. The first two abla-\ntions drop the two prompt schemas respectively in\nprompt-based event locating objective of Eq.(8),\nwhich verifies the effectiveness of reducing task\ndifficulty. Then, the third ablation removes con-\ntrastive event-correlation encoding and shows a\nsubstantial drop, which verifies the significance\nof explicit event-correlation learning.

Lastly, when removing all the objectives,\nour model degenerates to BART-large.\nComparison with Larger Model. A trend of pre-\ntraining models follows the law of ‘larger models\nfor better performance’ but a crucial research ques-\ntion is ‘how to perform competitively with fewer\ncomputation resources’. To answer, we show extra\nfine-tuning results on the five generation datasets in\nTable 7 to compare our ClarET (400M parameters)\nwith T5-large (770M) and T5-base (220M). It is\nobserved (i) with 3× scale, T5-large notably out-\nperforms T5-base to support the above law and (ii)\nwith almost half model size, our ClarET performs\nvery competitively to T5-large (even better on 3\nout of 5 tasks), verifying the significance of our\nobjectives towards event-related knowledge.\nDifficulty of Event Generation. To exhibit the\nlearning difficulty in pre-training (as stated in\n§3.2.1) and the effectiveness of our novel learn-\ning objectives, we conduct another ablation setting\nin Table 6. It is observed that ClarET achieves\nbetter event-level perplexity (ePPL), verifying the\ntwo novel objectives promote event generations\nand reduce difficulty of decoding.\nLong-span Event Generation. To further check\nif ClarET is more competitive on longer-span event\ngeneration, we compare it with BART-large and\nACR CS SEG CSG EPC\nSize R-L B-4 B-1 B-1 B-1\nT5-base 220M 38.40 81.02 52.64 41.28 56.53\nT5-large 770M 40.77 90.62 57.04 43.82 59.59\nClarET 400M 41.04 87.18 57.47 48.75 58.88\nTable 7: Fine-tuning generation results to compare with larger\npre-trained models.

Different from\nrecovering paradigm of others, we follow the de-\nnoising paradigm to implement BART and calcu-\nlate its score by considering the masked part in\ndecoding.

Our\nbasic model, BART-large, is presented for general\nNLU tasks. To exhibit our minor event-centric con-\ntinual pre-training would not interfere its NLU abil-\nity, we conduct fine-tuning experiments on GLUE\nbenchmark (Wang et al., 2019) as in Figure 5. It is\nobserved that, although slightly surpassed by the\ndiscriminative RoBERTa model, fine-tuning BART\nand ClarET achieve very comparable results, which\nverifies ClarET’s retention of NLU capability.\n4.3 Case Study and Error Analysis\nCase Study. As the first case in Figure 6, we\nconduct a case study on generative abductive rea-\nsoning task, where the fine-tuned ClarET generates\nan event semantically close to the gold reference,\nbut the BART does not. BART only generates a\npart of the answer but ignores the event-correlations\nfrom ‘They were impressed with my phone’, while\nClarET completely captures the correlations in the\n2566\nFigure 5: Fine-tuning results on GLUE dev, which verifies\nClarET retains BART’s natural language understanding ability.\nContext: I went to the store to buy a phone.

The second\ncase in Figure 6 shows that our ClarET is inef-\nfective when the gold event is very complicated. In\ndetail, the model focus only on ‘at the end of the\nday’ to generate ‘ ... spent the whole day ... ’ but\nignore very subtle contexts, e.g., ‘starting her job ...\nteacher’ and ‘they liked her’. To expand, we found\na problem in long-event decoding by pilot experi-\nments. As shown in Figure 7, it is observed that the\ngap of token-level perplexity between ClarET and\nWER-only gradually diminishes. This is because\nthe subsequent tokens in an event can be gener-\nated on the basis of previous generations on the\ndecoder side, rather than context-aware represen-\ntations from the encoder side. While a long span\nis masked, the model can see previous tokens in\nan event (i.e., e<t) in decoding and incline to per-\nform the t-th prediction based on e<t but not x/{e},\nespecially with a larger t. As a result, the model\nwould ‘cheat’ in the generation but learn decoder-\nside language modeling rather than context-aware\nrepresentations. In the future, we will exploit this\nproblem. Besides, due to computation resources,\nwe choose the model size with 400M and continual\n10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\nPosition (top-percentage) of a token\n0\n1\n2\n3Token perplexity\nClarET\nWER-Only\nFigure 7: Token-level perplexity w.r.t tokens’ percentage\npositions in events on held-out dev set.\npre-training in 90h, limiting the performance.\n5 Conclusion\nWe present a novel correlation-aware context-to-\nevent Transformer to self-supervisedly learn event-\ncorrelation knowledge from text corpus and benefit\nvarious event-centric reasoning scenarios. Besides\nSoTA fine-tuning results on 5 generation and 4 clas-\nsification tasks, we conduct zero-/few-shot learn-\ning and extensive ablation studies to exhibit our\nmodel’s effectiveness. Lastly, we find our model\nis competitive to a twice larger general-purpose\nmodel, reduces learning difficulty for event genera-\ntion, and retains NLU ability from its basic model.\nAlthough this work learns context-to-event knowl-\nedge, our self-supervised objectives are applica-\nble to other semantically-meaningful text units be-\nsides events. For example, text units can be entities\nand concepts to learn relational and commonsense\nknowledge, which can benefit more downstream\ntasks.\n6 Ethical Statement\nThis work does not involve any sensitive data, but\nonly public unlabeled corpora, i.e., BookCorpus\n(Zhu et al., 2015) pre-processed by Zhou et al.\n(2021b), and crowd-sourced datasets released in\nprevious works, including ART (Bhagavatula et al.,\n2020), TIMETRA VEL (Qin et al., 2019), APSI\n(Zhang et al., 2020a), MCNC (Li et al., 2018),\nROCStories (Mori et al., 2020).\nReferences\nChandra Bhagavatula, Ronan Le Bras, Chaitanya\nMalaviya, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Ari Holtzman, Han-\nnah Rashkin, Doug Downey, Wen-tau Yih, and Yejin\nChoi. 2020.

L2R2: leveraging ranking for abduc-\ntive reasoning. CoRR, abs/2005.11223.\nA Examples from Mined Pre-training\nCorpus\nThere are some mined pre-training examples shown\nin Table 8. As in (Zhou et al., 2021b), an example\nincludes a paragraph, events, a selected positive\nevent, connectives of the positive event, and sam-\npled negative events of the positive event.\nB More Details\nB.1 BART Pre-training Resources\nIn this section, we analyze BART pre-training re-\nsources in terms of text corpora and computation\nresources.\nAs for tokens in BART pre-training corpora,\nBART paper (Lewis et al., 2020) claims using the\nsame corpora as in RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and\nT5 paper (Raffel et al., 2020) states RoBERTa uses\na 2.2T-token text corpus. Thus, we adopt ‘2.2T’ as\nthe number in the main paper.\nAs for BART pre-training computation over-\nheads, the contributor of BART official code reposi-\ntory said ‘We trained for around 11-12 days on 256\ngpus.’ at https://github.com/pytorch/\nfairseq/issues/1525, so the BART pre-\ntraining takes from 67584 to 73728 GPU hours.\nThus, we use ‘70,000’ as the number in the main\npaper.\nB.2 Full Results of T5 Model\nThe full results of T5-base and T5-large on the five\ngeneration tasks are shown in Table 9.\n2571\nExample 1\nParagraph\nIt was only months later, when she saw her friend’s thin gaunt face, her swollen belly and her quiet\ndesperation, that she had come to her senses. Then she had been filled with a combination of burning\nrage and deep shame. This had endured over the years undiminished.\nPositive Event she had been filled with a combination of burning rage\nConnectives when; then\nNegative Events\nhe had been loaded with a lot of vampire venom\nshe had been trained in the art of gentler speech\nI had been blessed with some sort of fire ability\nhe had been transformed into a piece of living statuary\nhe had beened from a block of pale marble\nI had been circumci sculptsed in the age of infantile apathy\n...\nExample 2\nParagraph\nThen, when she turned twenty one at the end of last year, she had decided to act on it. A driver’s\nlicense was something she needed for her business and the identity papers which went with it were\nneeded for a range of other reasons, such as enrolling Catherine for school at the start of this year.\nPositive Event papers which went with it were needed for a range of other reasons\nConnectives then; when; and\nNegative Events\nbookcases that stood against it had opened like a pair of French doors\nit had a little bit of magic in it , just for Lizzie\nit only gave her a place for a couple of days\nwhich occasionally crossed a small ridge sometimes of gravel , sometimes of sand\nthat she was going shopping in the city with a couple of other girls\npublish that proposal in the paper for three weeks\n...\nTable 8: Some mined pre-training examples.\nAbductive C.S.\nReasoning\nCounterfactual\nStory\nStory Ending\nGeneration\nC.S.

(2021b), connectives (i.e.,\ndiscourse relations in the contexts) play important\nroles to express correlations among events. There-\nfore, we also find every possible connective r to\neach (x, e) where r is a connective in x, which im-\nmediately links to the verb of e on the parsing tree\nof x. To leverage the connectives, we also apply the\ncorrect event selection in prompt-based event lo-\ncating objective to r its negatives {¯r}M\n1 , as correct\nconnective selection. Here, ¯r is randomly sampled\nfrom discourse relations in the PDTB annotation\nmanual (Webber et al., 2019). At 20% times, we\nuse correct connective selection to replace correct\nevent selection in the prompt-based event locating\nobjective.\nC Details of Evaluation Datasets\nWe detail the nine evaluation datasets in the follow-\ning. The training example in each dataset is shown\nin Table 10.\n• ART (αNLG). Given two observations in nat-\nural language, it aims to generate an explica-\ntive hypothesis between them. We follow the\nofficial data split (Bhagavatula et al., 2020)\nwith 169,654/1,532/3,059 in training/dev/test.\n• TIMETRA VEL.Given an original story and\na counterfactual event, it aims to rewrite\nthe subsequent events to complete a story,\nwhich is compatible with the counterfactual\nevent. We follow the official data split (Qin\net al., 2019) with 98,159/5,613/7,484 in train-\ning/dev/test.\n2572\n• Story Ending Generation. We evaluate the\nstory ending generation based on ROCStories,\nwhich aims to generate a story ending for a\ngiven story context. We follow the data split\n(Guan et al., 2019) with 90,000/4,081/4,081\nin training/dev/test.\n• Commonsense Story Generation. It is based\non ROCStories. Given a leading context, it\naims to generate a reasonable story. We fol-\nlow the data split (Guan et al., 2020) with\n88,344/4,908/4,909 in training/dev/test.\n• APSI. We evaluate event process completion\non the APSI dataset, where the goal is to gen-\nerate a subevent for a given event context. We\nfollow the data split (Zhang et al., 2020a) with\n13,501/1,316 in training/test.\n• Multi-choice narrative cloze (MCNC).\nGiven an event chain, it aims to predict the\nsubsequent event from 5 candidates. We\nfollow the data split (Li et al., 2018) with\n140,331/10,000/10,000 in training/dev/test.\n• ART (αNLI). Given two observations in nat-\nural language, it aims to choose the most ex-\nplicative hypothesis from 2 candidates. We\nfollow the data split (Bhagavatula et al., 2020)\nwith 169,654/1532 samples in training/dev.\n• ROCStories. We follow (Mori et al., 2020)\nto use ROCStories for narrative incoherence\ndetection. A random sentence is removed\nfor each five-sentence story, and the goal\nis to predict the missing position. We fol-\nlow the data split (Mori et al., 2020) with\n78,528/9,816/9,817 in training/dev/test.\n• Story Cloze Test. Given a 4-sentence con-\ntext, it aims to select the right ending from\ntwo alternative endings. We follow the\ndata split (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016) with\n98,161/1,871/1,871 in training/dev/test.\nD Detailed Evaluation Results\nWe detail the full results on nine evaluation datasets\nas follows.\nD.1 Generation Tasks\nGeneration tasks include abductive commonsense\nreasoning (αNLG), counterfactual story generation,\nstory ending generation, commonsense story gener-\nation, and event process completion. The detailed\nresults of these generation tasks are shown in Ta-\nble 11, Table 12, Table 13, Table 14, and Table 15,\nrespectively. ClarET achieves state-of-the-art per-\nformance on all five generation tasks. In addition,\npre-trained language models show their strong gen-\neration ability on story generation tasks, i.e., story\nending generation and commonsense story genera-\ntion.\nD.2 Classification Tasks\nClassification tasks include script reasoning, ab-\nductive commonsense reasoning (αNLI), narrative\nincoherence detection, and story cloze test. The de-\ntailed results of these classification tasks are shown\nin Table 16, Table 17, Table 18, and Table 19, re-\nspectively. Compared with unified language mod-\nels, ClarET achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nAlthough strong discriminative models show their\ngreat ability on classification tasks, ClarET still\nachieves competitive performance.\n2573\nDataset 1: ART (αNLG)\nInput Observation1: The hayride was in October.\nObservation2: It was the perfect start to the fall season.\nLabel Keeping tradition we drank hot cocoa on the ride.\nDataset 2: TIMETRA VEL\nInput\nPremise: On my way to work I stopped to get some coffee.\nInitial: I went through the drive through and placed my order.\nOriginal_ending: I paid the cashier and patiently waited for my drink.\nWhen she handed me the drink, the lid came off and spilled on me.\nThe coffee hurt and I had to go home and change clothes.\nCounterfactual: I went inside to place my order.\nLabel\nI paid the cashier and patiently waited at the counter for my drink.\nWhen she handed me the drink, the lid came off and spilled on me.\nThe coffee hurt and I had to go home and change clothes.\nDataset 3: Story Ending Generation\nInput\nDan’s parents were overweight.\nDan was overweight as well.\nThe doctors told his parents it was unhealthy.\nHis parents understood and decided to make a change.\nLabel They got themselves and Dan on a diet.\nDataset 4: Commonsense Story Generation\nInput Carrie had just learned how to ride a bike.\nLabel\nShe didn’t have a bike of her own.\nCarrie would sneak rides on her sister’s bike.\nShe got nervous on a hill and crashed into a wall.\nThe bike frame bent and Carrie got a deep gash on her leg.\nDataset 5: APSI\nInput Process name: Treat Pain.
