INTRODUCTION\nStator winding inter-turn short circuit protection is essen-\ntial for large generators. Phase-segregated transverse dif-\nferential protection is an ideal scheme against the fault.\nUnfortunately, for most steam turbine generators and some\nhydro turbine generators, there is no room at the neutral\npoint to install any conventional electromagnetic current\ntransformer (CT) on each group of winding branches of\neach phase to facilitate phase-segregated transverse differ-\nential protection. To a steam turbine generator, only a ded-\nicated voltage transformer (VT) for inter-turn short circuit\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Malabika Basu\n.\nprotection can be installed and longitudinal zero sequence\nvoltage protection can be applied against the fault. In some\nhydro turbine generators, only one dedicated CT for unit\ntransverse differential protection can be installed at the con-\nnecting point between the neutral points of two groups of\nthree phase winding branches. In some inter-turn fault cases,\nthe sensitivity and operating time of unit transverse differen-\ntial protection and longitudinal zero sequence voltage protec-\ntion may not be satisfactory for clearing the fault quickly and\npreventing the generator from damage. For example, a gen-\nerator of a hydropower plant in Zhejiang Province, China\nhas been damaged after twice experiencing long-lasting stator\nwinding inter-turn short circuit fault, although the unit trans-\nverse differential protection operated correctly.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Sensing principle of FOCT.\nAs a common electrical fault of a large generator, the inter-\nturn short circuit in ﬁeld windings (ISCFW) may lead to\nan earth fault between the ﬁeld winding and the rotor body\nand magnetization of the main shaft without timely intr-\nervention. Steady-state unbalanced currents of even orders\nand fractional orders related with pole pairs inside phase\nwindings are applicable to monitor the ISCFW [1], [2]. Split-\nphase transverse differential current reﬂects the steady-state\ncurrent imbalance inside the stator winding. Unfortunately,\nfor most steam turbine generators and some hydro turbine\ngenerators, phase-segregated transverse differential current\nis unable to be obtained due to impossibility of installing\nbranch current transformer in the narrow space inside the\ngenerator.\nFibre optical current transformer (FOCT) which uses the\nﬁbre optic cable as a sensor can be mounted on any shape of\nconductor in a limited space to measure the current of each\ngroup of winding branches of each phase, to optimize the\nprotection scheme for a generator. FOCT has many applica-\ntions in substations, especially in China. Alstom has applica-\ntions of FOCT in Smart Substation and High Voltage Direct\nCurrent Transmission [3]. (NARI-Relays Electric Company)\nNREC has also successfully applied FOCT in underground\ncable fault discrimination etc. [4], [5]. But there is almost no\napplication on generators in any power plant up to now. This\npaper provides an example of application on a generator.\nII. BASIC PRINCIPLE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF FOCT\nA. FIBRE OPTICAL CURRENT TRANSFORMER\nFaraday magnetic optical effect is utilized by FOCT to mea-\nsure current, as shown in Fig.1. Firstly, non-polarized light\nis linearly polarized by a polarizer. Secondly, the linearly\npolarized light passes through a magnetic optical material\n(ﬁbre optic in this case) with its polarization direction being\nregulated by the magnetic ﬁeld. The rotation angle of the\npolarized light (Faraday Optical rotation angle (ϕ )) is posi-\ntively correlated with magnetic induction intensity. Finally,\nthe Faraday Optical rotation angle is analyzed by an analyzer\nto calculate the magnetic ﬁeld intensity and the current that\ngenerates the magnetic ﬁeld [6]–[8].\nWhen the optical ﬁbre is closed around the conductor,\nthe relationship between the Faraday Optical rotation angle\nTABLE 1. Transient characteristic test of a FOCT (rated current 3kA).\nand current is described as:\nϕ =V\n∫\nl\nH ·dl =VNL I (1)\nwhere V is the Verdet constant of optical medium, l is the\npropagation distance of light in the optical medium, H is the\nmagnetic induction intensity, NL is the number of optical ﬁbre\nloops and I is the electric current of the conductor.\nB. CHARACTERISTICS OF FOCT\nReference [9] designed a space-saving sensor of FOCT,\nwhich is made of Spun Highly-birefringent ﬁbre optic cable\nand can be wound around the primary conductor in any\nshape, thus a good solution for generator protection. The\ncurrent measurement range of FOCT applied to generator\nprotection shall be 8-10 times of rated current, and the\nmaximum may exceed 300kA. According to different units,\na suitable number of coils of optical ﬁbre sensing ring can be\ndesigned to obtain good current measurement performance,\nand the volume of FOCT will not increase signiﬁcantly.\nMoreover, FOCT is very suitable for generator protection\nbecause it has some obvious advantages compared with\nconventional CT.\nReferences [10]–[12] analyse the cause and mechanism of\nCT saturation. Because the B-H magnetization curve of CT\ncore is nonlinear, steady-state CT saturation can be caused by\nlarge steady-state symmetrical short current, and transient CT\nsaturation can be caused by the decaying aperiodic compo-\nnent in short circuit current and/or by CT remanence. In case\nof short circuit fault of power equipment, the current increases\nrapidly, and the decaying DC component will be produced.\nWhen an electromagnetic CT saturates, the current waveform\nat its secondary side is distorted.\nThere is no saturation problem for a FOCT as there is\nno iron core. According to the transient characteristics test\nmethod of IEC 60044-8-2002 Part 8: electronic current trans-\nformer, the test results of a FOCT in Xi’an High Voltage\nApparatus Research Institute are shown in table 1.\nThe test process shown in Table 1 is as follows:\n‘c-0.1s-o’ is the ﬁrst power on operation, i.e., ‘‘close-0.1s-\nopen’’. A mixed current consisting of 46.8kA symmetrical\ncurrent and about 80kA decaying DC component is given\nin 0.1s, and the decaying time constant is 100ms; After 0.5s\nshutdown, the second power on operation is carried out, and\nthe speciﬁc process is the same with the ﬁrst power on pro-\ncess. From the test results, FOCT has excellent transient char-\nacteristics, and the maximum transient error is about 2.0%.\nTherefore, FOCT applied to generator differential protection\nwill obtain better protection performance.\n172406 VOLUME 8, 2020\nJ. Chenet al.: Research and Application of Generator Protection Based on FOCT\nTABLE 2. Measurement accuracy of harmonic current of FOCT.\nTABLE 3. Characteristics comparison of FOCT and electromagnetic CT.\nIn addition, FOCT has better performance for much wider\nfrequency range compared with the conventional electromag-\nnetic CT. FOCT has good measurement performance for\nharmonic current. Table 2 shows the current measurement\naccuracy test result of a FOCT at various frequencies in Xi’an\nHigh Voltage Apparatus Research Institute.\nFOCT can completely retain the DC and higher harmonic\ncomponents in the current, which is conducive to the research\nand implementation of new protection principle based on\nharmonic component.\nIn summary, the characteristics comparison results of\nFOCT and electromagnetic CT are shown in Table 3.\nFOCT also has some shortcomings, which should be\novercome in practical applications. The temperature of the\ngenerator is high and the range of variation is large. The\nambient temperature has an adverse effect on the measure-\nment performance of FOCT. Reference [10] proposes that\nthe Verdet constant of the sensing ﬁbre and the quarter-wave\nplate error parameter are the main factors affecting temper-\nature performance of FOCT. The solution is to adjust the\nquarter-wave plate parameters to compensate the inﬂuence\nof the Verdet constant of the sensing ﬁbre. Reference [9] pro-\nposes that the digital dual close-loop demodulation scheme\nwith four-state bias modulation and digital ramp feedback is\nadopted to enhance the dynamic range, measurement accu-\nracy and long-term stability of FOCT. The measurement\nerror of FOCT is less than 0.2% in temperature range of\n−40◦C ∼70◦C with these measures.\nFIGURE 2. Generator protection scheme based on FOCT.\nIII. GENERATOR PROTECTION BASED ON FOCT\nA. GENERATOR STATOR FAULT PROTECTION SCHEME\nBASED ON FOCT\nA generator with two stator winding branches is shown\nin Fig.2. The FOCT sensor, which is a ﬁbre optic cable,\nis wound around the conductor coming from each stator wind-\ning branch of each phase at the neutral point of the generator.\nThe other parts of the FOCT, including the non-polarized\nlight source, the polarizer and the analyzer, together with\nthe signal processing circuit, are installed in the Merging\nUnit (MU). The MU processes the received signal, and sends\nthe result (instantaneous value of current) to the generator\nprotection relay via a ﬁbre optic communication channel as\nper IEC 61850-9-2. After receiving the sampling data from\ndifferent MU, the protection device uses an interpolation\nalgorithm to process data synchronization according to the\ndelay time of each measurement channel. The delay time of\nFOCT measurement channel is about 20us ∼500us, which\nhas almost no inﬂuence on the protection performance. Addi-\ntionally, FOCT can also be installed at the terminal of each\nphase.\nProtective functions are realized based on the same current\nsignals provided by FOCT. Details of the protective functions\nare presented in Table 4.\nWith the capability for a number of protective func-\ntions, the conﬁguration of these functions is optimized based\non quantitative calculation and analysis. The overall per-\nformance of generator protection, including the sensitivity\nagainst stator winding inter-turn short circuit fault and stator\nwinding branch open circuit fault is improved.\nB. GENERATOR ONLINE MONITORING OF THE ISCFW\nBASED ON FOCT\nWhen turn to turn fault occurs in the rotor winding, the rotor\nmagnetic potential is no longer symmetrical. Through the\ninduction of the air gap magnetic ﬁeld, the stator winding\ncurrent will generate harmonic components related to the\nnumber of pole pairs, and this electrical performance is dif-\nferent from the harmonic characteristics of other faults. The\nVOLUME 8, 2020 172407\nJ. Chenet al.: Research and Application of Generator Protection Based on FOCT\nTABLE 4. Details of the protective functions.\nexcitation potential induced by these harmonics is different\nin each branch of the same phase in the stator winding, so the\ncirculating current between different branches is generated.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the currents of two stator wind-\ning branches are measured by FOCT, and then split-phase\ntransverse differential current is achieved. With application of\nfull-wave Fourier algorithm, RMS of Isp.1/P,Isp.2/P . . .(frac-\ntional/even harmonics) of split-phase transverse differential\ncurrent is acquired [Here ‘‘P’’ refers to the number of pole\npairs].\nIn the case of inter-turn short circuit fault, the eigenvalue\nincreases due to fractional harmonics (e.g. 1/P, 2/P ...).\nOn the contrary, in case of other faults or normal operation,\nthe eigenvalue is much smaller (less than 0.1 p.u.). If the\neigenvalue exceeds the corresponding threshold, the occur-\nrence of an inter-turn short circuit fault is conﬁrmed and\nonline monitoring of the inter-turn short circuit fault is\nachieved.\nThe eigenvalue of the harmonics is calculated in this way:\nIsp.Harm =\n\n√\n∞∑\nk =1\nk ̸=P,k ̸=3P\nI2\nsp.k/P (2)\nwhere Isp.Harm is the eigenvalue of the harmonics, Isp.k/P is the\nRMS of corresponding fractional harmonic, k̸=P and k̸=3P.\nSince k̸=P and k̸=3P, the fundamental and 3rd harmonics are\nexcluded from calculation of the eigenvalue.\nIn December 2011, a dynamic simulation experiment of\nthis scheme was performed at Tsinghua University. The\nresults indicate that the sensitivity of this scheme reaches\n5% of the short-circuit turn ratio. Details of the experimental\nresults are presented in Table 5.\nIn March 2012, this scheme was performed at Zhejiang\nXin’an River Hydropower Plant, and then was put into\noperation at Yixing Pumped Storage Power Plant and Ertan\nHydropower Plant. The waveform of transverse differential\ncurrent in an alarm event of the ﬁeld device is shown in Fig.3.\nTABLE 5. Details of the dynamic simulation experimental results.\nFIGURE 3. Transverse differential current in an alarm event of the field\ndevice.\nFIGURE 4. Frequency analysis of transverse differential current.\nThe amplitude of the transverse current changes period-\nically and contains many harmonic components. The spec-\ntrum analysis result of the current is shown in Fig.4. The\nhigher frequency harmonic component is not shown in the\nﬁgure because of low amplitude.\nAs seen in Fig.4, the main harmonic components are\n54.8Hz, 52.4Hz, 47.6Hz, 45.2Hz and 40.5Hz, and which\ncorrespond to\n(\n1 +2\np\n)\nfn,\n(\n1 +1\np\n)\nfn,\n(\n1 −1\np\n)\nfn,\n(\n1 −2\np\n)\nfn\nand\n(\n1 −4\np\n)\nfn. The number of pole pairs p =21, and rated\nfrequency fn =50Hz.\nC. OPERATING TIME OF PHASE DIFFERENTIAL\nPROTECTION BASED ON FOCT\nCT saturation affects the performance of differential pro-\ntection to a large extent and can lead to misoperation or\nmaloperation. The terminal current, neutral current and dif-\nferential current waveforms of generator phase A based on\n172408 VOLUME 8, 2020\nJ. Chenet al.: Research and Application of Generator Protection Based on FOCT\nFIGURE 5. Generator current waveforms based on conventional CT for\ngenerator outside fault.\na conventional CT for a generator outside fault is shown\nin Fig.5.\nAs seen from Fig.5, the false differential current is calcu-\nlated due to the serious saturation of a conventional CT at\nthe end of the machine. A common practice to avoid these\nconsequences is to add CT saturation identiﬁcation to the\ndifferential protection logic. Various methods are invented,\none is based on the feature that the unsaturated period still\nexists in each cycle under CT saturation, another uses the\ntime difference between the instant that the fault occurs\nand the instant that the CT starts to saturate [13]–[15].\nCT saturation identiﬁcation runs all of the time and in addi-\ntion to differential protection action logic discrimination,\nthe CT saturation detection module increases the logic com-\nplexity and prolongs the operating time of the differential\nprotection by several milliseconds when an internal fault\noccurs.\nOn the contrary, there is no saturation problem for a FOCT\nas there is no iron core. Therefore, the measurement perfor-\nmance of FOCT is independent of waveform and magnitude\nof current. The terminal current, neutral current and differen-\ntial current waveforms of generator phase A based on FOCT\nis shown in Fig.6 in the case of the same generator outside\nfault.\nAs seen from Fig.6, there is no waveform distortion caused\nby CT saturation at the generator terminal and neutral side\ncurrent. The differential current, which only contains unbal-\nanced current caused by CT measurement error on both\nsides, is too small to lead to misoperation of the differential\nprotection.\nCT saturation identiﬁcation is disabled for a current dif-\nferential protection device that connects to FOCT, thus\nthe protection logic is simpliﬁed and the operating time\nis shortened by several milliseconds. A phase to phase\nfault inside a generator develops very quickly; shortening\nthe protection operation time by even several milliseconds\ncan prevent signiﬁcant damage from occuring within the\ngenerator.\nFIGURE 6. Generator current waveforms based on FOCT for generator\noutside fault.\nFIGURE 7. Unbalance current and restrained characteristic.\nD. SENSITIVITY OF PHASE DIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION\nBASED ON FOCT\nLoad current or external fault current passes through current\nfor differential protection, while differential imbalance cur-\nrent increases gradually with the increase of passing current\nfor the factors of CT transformation characterized by: (1) ratio\nand angle error of individual protection class CT; (2) CT sat-\nuration caused by aperiodic component or by CT remanence;\n(3) mismatching in the types of CTs [16].\nPercentage restraint characteristic is introduced in order\nto prevent unwanted operation caused by imbalance cur-\nrent [17], [18], (Fig.7). The start current for differential pro-\ntection (Ip) is set to be larger than the maximum imbalance\ncurrent when the generator runs at its rated capacity. Set-\nting of the restraint slope is large enough to overcome the\nmaximum imbalance current when external fault occurs. For\ndifferential protection based on FOCT, the above settings are\nreduced properly to get higher sensitivity. FOCT is of higher\naccuracy, has less likelihood of saturation and less imbalance\ncurrent compared to a conventional electromagnetic CT.\nAs seen from Fig.7, the generator differential protection\nbased on FOCT is set at a lower action threshold than that of\nan electromagnetic CT and the scope of action area is larger.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 172409\nJ.

Optimized main protection scheme for Shenzhen pumped\nstorage station generator-motor.\nFIGURE 9. FOCT installed on the 4th branch.\nThe shaded part of the ﬁgure is the extra action area, so the\noperation sensitivity of the protection is higher. For exam-\nple, the variable percentage restraint differential protection\npermits three main settings: the differential starting value,\nthe initial ratio value and the maximum ratio value. Settings\nof complete longitudinal differential protection based on elec-\ntromagnetic CT and FOCT is shown in table 6.\nIV. FIELD APPLICATION AND MEASUREMENT\nPERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\nThe proposed scheme was implemented on a 300MW gen-\nerator at Shenzhen Pump-storage Power Plant, Guangdong\nProvince, China. There are seven stator winding branches for\neach phase which are separated into two groups. Electromag-\nnetic CTs are installed on both branch groups. Although a\nvariety of differential protection functions, including com-\nplete longitudinal differential protection and split phase\nFIGURE 10. Conventional CT two times current during pump startup\nprocess at 4% rated speed.\nFIGURE 11. FOCT two times current during pump startup process at 4%\nrated speed.\ntransverse differential protection have been conﬁgured, there\nis still a protection dead zone such as stator inter-turn short\ncircuit fault with small turns. To implement the proposed\nscheme, FOCTs were installed at the terminal side and the\n4th branch on neutral side of generator, as shown in Fig.8.\nFOCT installed on the 4 th branch is shown in Fig.9.\nWith the help of FOCT installed on stator winding branch,\nincomplete longitudinal differential protection was added to\nthe existing differential protection to form a complete stator\nand rotor winding inter-turn short circuit fault protection\nscheme. The protection scheme can improve overall sensi-\ntivity and avoid protection dead zone for inter-turn faults.\nApplication of FOCT allows the generator protection to\nremain active and highly sensitive during startup or shutdown.\nThe waveforms of conventional CT and FOCT are shown\nin Fig.10 and Fig.11 respectively when the pump speed of the\npumped storage unit rises to 4% of its rated speed (stator side\nelectrical frequency 2 Hz).\n172410 VOLUME 8, 2020\nJ. Chenet al.: Research and Application of Generator Protection Based on FOCT\nFrom Fig.10 and Fig.11, it can be seen that at very low\nfrequencies, a conventional CT has obvious distortion due\nto saturated secondary current, while FOCT is good in low-\nfrequency transmission.\nV. CONCLUSION\nAn FOCT sensor can be wound around a conductor in any\nshape in a narrow space. Additionally, FOCT’s used within\na generator stator winding branch at the neutral point allow\nmeasurement of the branch current and facilitate optimized\ngenerator protection. The use of FOCT’s effectively improves\nthe performance of current differential protection by way of\ndecreased operating time and improved sensitivity through\nreduction of CT saturation caused by aperiodic components\nand bad low-frequency response by an electromagnetic CT.\nFOCT’s and their respective relays have been in successful\noperation in several power plants in China for some time.\nAs a result, the number of FOCT’s in operation in power\nplants is set to increase due to their highly accurate measure-\nment capabilities [19], [20]. However, the stability of FOCT’s\nover long time periods in harsh environments such as wide\nranging temperatures, high and persistent vibration, and high\nelectromagnetic radiation near the generator, etc. is yet to be\nvalidated in practice.\nREFERENCES\n[1] L.
