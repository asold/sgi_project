The release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November\n2022 [7] and Meta’s LLaMA model in February 2023, followed by many others, sparked a significant\nshift in NLP research and applications.

Salinas et al.\nBard [3] have emerged during this period. The proliferation of LLMs indicates their increasing\nubiquity, emphasizing the need to understand the biases inherent in these models and their potential\nsocietal impacts.\nLLMs inadvertently reflect and perpetuate biases in their training data[4, 6, 29]. Content filtering\ntechniques have been used to mitigate harmful outputs [16], but biased behavior can still persist\nin the underlying model [ 33]. The deployment of biased models in real-world applications can\nlead to harmful consequences, as evidenced by cases like the COMPAS system1 and AI healthcare\npredictions [22].\nResearchers and engineers are exploring novel ways to design effective prompts for their use\ncase [32]. Radlinski et al. [24] discussed the usage of natural language representations of users\nand objects in an effort to promote transparency and flexibility of representations, as opposed to\nusing less interpretable vector representations. While LLMs provide a revolutionary opportunity to\nchange the way we interact with models, researchers and engineers must proceed with caution\nand acknowledge the potential for unintended bias to be introduced into their system.\nIn our study, we propose a method to measure bias within LLMs through the lens of job recom-\nmendations, demonstrating that mere mentions of demographic attributes, such as gender pronouns\nor nationality, can have a significant impact on the distribution of results. We apply our method\nto investigate the biases present in ChatGPT and LLaMA, examining bias at the intersection of\nnationality and gender identity. As AI models have already been found to introduce bias in hiring\noutcomes, leveraging our method to analyze internal biases in the context of job recommendations\nis valuable analysis to prevent harm in job-related applications of these LLMs. Finally, we analyze\nif the biases found within the LLMs mirror bias in U.S. labor statistics. We aim to shed light on the\nbiases exhibited by these models and contribute to a broader understanding of the impact of LLMs\nin decision-making processes.\n2 RELATED WORK\nDemographic and cultural biases in LLMs often arise from the generalization of training data to\nnew inputs, leading to the propagation of biases present in the training data [9]. Previous work\nexamined biases in GPT-2’s occupational associations across protected categories [14]. They found\nbiases in predicted jobs for different demographics, aligning with patterns observed in United States\nBureau of Labor data.\nVarious investigations have examined political biases in ChatGPT [18, 26, 27], revealing a ten-\ndency towards liberal and progressive responses on the political compass. Studies have also explored\nbiases related to religion [1], finding that GPT-3 generations with the word “Muslim” led to more\nviolence-related responses compared to other religious identities. Additionally, gender bias in LLMs\nhas been examined, including through the usage of causal mediation analysis [31], revealing the\ncontribution of the training process to gender bias. Furthermore, comparative analyses indicated\nthat GPT-2 models exhibit relatively less stereotypical behavior compared to embedding-based\nmodels like BERT and RoBERTa on the Context Association Test [21]. The inherent bias in the\ntextual modality and the subjective nature of fairness pose challenges in addressing biases in LLMs\n[9].\nExisting template-based benchmarks for measuring biases in LLMs have been criticized for\ncontaining irrelevant stereotypes and unnatural phrasings [5]. Minor modifications to templates\ncan lead to significant variations in measured biases, highlighting the brittleness and instability of\nthese benchmarks [28].\n1https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\n2\nThe Unequal Opportunities of Large Language Models EAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA\nFig. 1. Geographical Distribution of 20 Nationalities Recommended by ChatGPT, to be analyzed within our\nstudy. Regional preferences are demonstrated in the countries selected by ChatGPT.\nWhile previous works focus on measuring underlying associations and biases within a model’s\nknowledge, our work studies the ways this knowledge is operationalized as belief. Our work\nexplores how internal biases propagate into downstream tasks through the analysis of bias in job\nrecommendations for different demographics.\n3 METHODOLOGY\nWe propose a simple template-based approach to examine demographic bias in LLMs, through\nthe lens of job recommendations. This approach involves requesting job recommendations for\na “recently laid-off friend” while naturalistically mentioning demographic attributes that may\nintroduce bias. We apply our method to analyze bias within the intersection of gender identity and\nnationality, although our approach can be extended to include additional demographic attributes.\n3.1 Language Models\nWe select two widely-used large language models for our analysis: OpenAI’s ChatGPT [7] and Meta’s\nLLaMA [30]. These models are chosen based on their popularity and impressive text-generation\ncapabilities. They offer broad applicability to various real-world scenarios.\nWe utilize the ChatGPT API with the ’gpt-3.5-turbo’ version and the LLaMA 65B checkpoint.\nBoth models are configured with a temperature of 0.8, a common setting used to promote diversity\nin generated outputs [8, 15]. We sample 50 outputs per query to obtain a representative distribution\nof the model’s responses.\n3.2 Selecting Demographic Attributes\nOur bias measurement approach revolves around the naturalistic inclusion of demographic at-\ntributes in prompts. There are no limitations to the number of demographic attributes a prompt\ncan include, however, for our analysis we choose to analyze the intersection of gender identity\nand nationality. We conduct our experiments across 20 nationalities (see Appendix Table 5) and\n2 gender identities. We acknowledge the potential for a wider range of nationalities and gender\nidentities to be examined in future work.\nTo select the 20 nationalities, we prompt ChatGPT to “Provide a list of common nationalities”.\nThis approach aims to include countries frequently encountered during its training, allowing the\nmodel to make informed recommendations. However, we note that bias is already apparent from\n3\nEAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA A.

Three prompt templates used to query job recommendations and their corresponding baseline. Our\nexperiment fills each main template with varying country and pronoun pairs to measure demographic bias\nacross the intersection of gender identity and nationality. We use the “Prompt ID” to reference these prompts\nthroughout the paper.\nthe nationalities generated. For instance, the generation is biased toward Western countries while\nno African countries were mentioned. Figure 1 displays the 20 countries selected by ChatGPT.\n3.3 Generating Job Recommendations\nTo assess bias, we design three naturalistic templates to request job recommendations for a “recently\nlaid-off friend. ” We ensure that our templates are naturalistic and reflective of realistic language,\nas suggested by previous research [ 5]. These templates imply nationality by mentioning the\nfriend’s potential return to a specific country if they do not find a job, while explicitly stating their\ncurrent location in the United States to facilitate comparison with labor statistics. We use pronouns\n(she/her/hers, he/him/his) as proxies for gender identities (woman, man). We acknowledge gender\nidentity’s non-binary nature but leave the exploration of other pronouns and identities for future\nresearch. To account for the unreliability of measurements based on individual templates [ 28],\nwe employ three semantically similar variations of each template. Table 1 shows the handcrafted\ntemplates.\nWe prompt our models to generate both job recommendations and their corresponding salaries,\nenabling a more detailed and quantifiable analysis of demographic bias. Each model is prompted\n50 times per template, for each combination of gender identity and nationality. While ChatGPT\nprovided consistent formatting without explicit instructions, LLaMA required output format in-\nstructions. Full prompts used for ChatGPT and LLaMA can be found in Appendix Table 3.\n4\nThe Unequal Opportunities of Large Language Models EAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA\n(a) ChatGPT Job Clusters\n (b) LLaMA Job Clusters\nFig. 2. Visualization of the embedding space, in two dimensions using dimensionality reduction, showing\nthe embeddings of all unique job titles returned by ChatGPT and LLaMA across three semantically-similar\nprompts. We cluster the embeddings and color each unique job title with its corresponding cluster’s color.\n3.4 Defining Bias and Fairness\nThe definition of “bias” in LLMs can vary depending on the use case and the chosen definition of\nbias. In our job recommendation task, we assert that the demographic attributes provided should not\ninfluence the responses generated. The LLMs should not make assumptions about a person’s skills\nor capabilities based on nationality or gender identity. Our notion of fairness aligns with statistical\nparity, where each nationality and gender identity should receive the same or approximately the\nsame distribution of job recommendations. Fairness, in this context, means the absence of prejudice\nor favoritism based on inherent or acquired characteristics [20].\n3.5 Identifying Clusters of Similar Jobs\nDuring job recommendation generation, ChatGPT and LLaMA produced a combined total of over\n6,000 unique job titles. To analyze biases related to specific job types, we employed BERTopic [10] to\ncluster similar jobs. Job embeddings were generated using the ’all-MiniLM-L6-v2’ [13] transformer\nmodel. Figure 2 shows a two-dimensional visualization of the job embeddings achieved through\nUniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) [19] for dimension reduction. BERTopic\nidentified 17 clusters from ChatGPT and 19 clusters from LLaMA. Each cluster was assigned a\nformatted variation of the cluster name provided by BERTopic, offering insight into the types of jobs\nrepresented in each cluster. The 10 most important words for each cluster, based on the c-TF-IDF\nmetric, can be found in Appendix C. Clustering allowed us to observe similarities in recommended\njobs and identify any cluster-level biases during our analysis.\n3.5.1 Analysis of Job Clusters.Upon clustering the job recommendations, we observed distinctions\nbetween the embeddings produced by ChatGPT and LLaMA. Figure 2 demonstrates that ChatGPT’s\nclusters are more distinct and separable compared to LLaMA’s clusters. This discrepancy can be\nattributed to the number of unique job suggestions generated across all prompts and demographic\nattributes. ChatGPT produced 614 unique job suggestions, while LLaMA suggested 6,106.\n5\nEAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA A. Salinas et al.\n(a) ChatGPT Word Cloud\n (b) LLaMA Word Cloud\nFig. 3. Word cloud visualization of all job titles returned by ChatGPT and LLaMA for three semantically-\nsimilar prompts. Word size corresponds to the frequency of that word being suggested by the model. Color\ncorresponds to the probability of that word being offered to a man versus a woman. (blue skews male, gold\nskews female).\nWhile LLaMA captured a broader range of jobs spanning various fields, the quality of some job\nrecommendations decreased, including impractical professions like“Bed Warmer. ” Additionally,\nthere was a difference in granularity, with ChatGPT’s clusters being more specific due to the\nrelatively smaller number of jobs per cluster. LLaMA’s clusters were more general and could\nencompass multiple clusters from ChatGPT.\n4 ANALYSIS OF JOB RECOMMENDATIONS\n4.1 Word Clouds\nWe first employed word cloud visualizations, as seen in figure 3, to examine the job recommen-\ndations produced by our models. The size of each word corresponds to its frequency in the job\nrecommendations. We color-coded each word based on its occurrence in male recommendations\ndivided by the total occurrences. The color is assigned as follows:\n6\nThe Unequal Opportunities of Large Language Models EAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA\n(a) ChatGPT Probabilities\n (b) LLaMA Probabilities\nFig. 4. Probabilities of each job type being offered, given each of our three prompts. These probabilities are\ncomputed from over 2000 generations, with varying combinations of nationality and gender identity.\n𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒(𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑)= 𝐶𝑂𝑈𝑁𝑇 (𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒 )\n𝐶𝑂𝑈𝑁𝑇 (𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒 )+𝐶𝑂𝑈𝑁𝑇 (𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠 𝑓 𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒) =\n \n\n𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒 if score ≥0.8,\n𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑏𝑙𝑢𝑒 if 0.8 > score ≥0.6,\n𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑦 if 0.6 > score ≥0.4,\n𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑 if 0.4 > score ≥0.2,\n𝑔𝑜𝑙𝑑 otherwise\nThe distribution of job recommendations is generally similar across all three prompts, with\nLLaMA providing a more diverse set of job suggestions. Both models frequently recommend\nmanagerial and software-related jobs for both men and women. However, we observe that assistant,\nassociate, and administrative roles are more frequently suggested to women than men by both\nmodels and across all prompts. On the other hand, trade jobs such as electrician, mechanic, plumber,\nand welder are more often recommended to men.\n4.2 Distribution of Job Recommendations\nFigure 4 illustrates the overall distribution of job types recommended by our models, showing some\nrobustness to semantic-preserving differences in our prompts. Across 𝑛 total job types, represented\nby 𝑗𝑜𝑏𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 𝑖, and three total prompts represented by 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑡 𝑗, we computed the standard deviation\nof the probabilities that each job type would be recommended across the three prompts. This\ncalculation enables us to quantify the changes in job recommendation probabilities across prompts.\n¯𝑃 (𝑗𝑜𝑏𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 𝑗)represents the average probability that the given job type would be recommended.\nThis formula is expressed as follows:\n1\n𝑛\n𝑛∑︁\n𝑖=1\nvut\n1\n3\n3∑︁\n𝑗=1\n(𝑃 (𝑗𝑜𝑏𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 𝑖|𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑡 𝑗)− ¯𝑃 (𝑗𝑜𝑏𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 𝑖))2\n7\nEAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA A. Salinas et al.\nFor ChatGPT, the average standard deviation of recommendation probabilities was 7.6%, while\nLLaMA exhibited an average standard deviation of 2.0%. Comparing the models’ standard deviations\nmay not be entirely fair due to their unique job clusters and LLaMA having a larger number of\nuniquely titled jobs, however, we acknowledge that some of these LLaMA’s unique job titles are\nsimply variations of the same job, such as “AOL Software Engineer“ and “Software Engineer. “\n4.3 Job Recommendation Gender Identity Comparison\nFigure 5 illustrates the differences in the probability of specific job types being recommended\nto men versus women. Both models exhibit clear biases towards specific gender identities for\nvarious job types, but the biases tend to be more pronounced in ChatGPT. For example, the\ndifference in the probability of recommending “Driver; Warehouse; Laborer; Delivery” to men\nversus women is over 20% in two out of three prompts for ChatGPT. In contrast, the largest difference\nin probability observed in LLaMA is less than 10%, indicating that LLaMA’s job recommendations\nare less dependent on gender identity.\n4.4 Job Recommendation Nationality Comparison\nFigure 6 demonstrates variations in job recommendation types by nationality. To generate this\nfigure, we calculated the probability of a job type being recommended, conditioned on a specific\ncountry being mentioned (𝑃 (𝑗𝑜𝑏𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 |𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑦 )). We conducted 100 generations per country, with\n50 for men and 50 for women. The y-axis represents the total number of generations containing a\nparticular job type.\nIn a fair model, we would expect the same probability of a given job type being recommended\nfor all countries. However, we observe that the variance across nationalities in the probability of\nrecommending a specific job type is smaller for LLaMA compared to ChatGPT. We note, however,\nthat this may not be a fair comparison due to the unique cluster sets of each model and the fact\nthat LLaMA encompasses a larger number of unique jobs.\nWe observe consistent deviations in recommendations for Mexican candidates, with probabilities\nconsistently above or below those of other countries. This bias is particularly clear in ChatGPT’s\nrecommendations. For instance, while “Engineer; Software; Quality; Assurance” is a highly recom-\nmended job type, being recommended in over 90% of generations in two out of three prompts for\nall other nationalities, it is recommended less than 15% of the time for Mexican candidates in all\nthree prompts. These figures indicate clear variations in job recommendations based on nationality.\nInterestingly, the baseline, where no nationality is mentioned, also tends to be an outlier in\nChatGPT. For prompt 3, while retail work was suggested in no more than 61% of generations\nacross the nationalities tested, it was recommended at least once in almost 100% of the baseline\nresponses. While the baseline especially stood out as an outlier for many job types in prompt\n3, the other prompts also exhibited several job types where the baseline deviated significantly.\nThis can be observed in job types such as “Technician; Scientist; Biotech; Researcher, ” or “Driver;\nWarehouse; Laborer; Delivery. ” A fair model would treat all nationalities equally, and we would\nexpect the absence of any nationality information to yield the same recommendations as including\nany nationality.\n4.5 Job Recommendations Gender Identity and Nationality Differences\nFigure 7 shows a heatmap of the ratio of job recommendations for each gender identity across\nnationalities. The lightest shade of blue represents job types recommended exclusively to men in\nthat country, while the lightest shade of orange represents the opposite scenario. Several interesting\npatterns emerge from the analysis.\n8\nThe Unequal Opportunities of Large Language Models EAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA\n(a) ChatGPT Differences\n(b) LLaMA Differences\nFig. 5. Differences in the probability of a given job type to be offered to men versus women. We show\nthese differences across each prompt for both ChatGPT and LLaMA. The male and female probabilities are\ncomputed from 1000 generations each, with varying combinations of nationality and gender identity.\nIn ChatGPT, we observe consistent gender biases across nationalities, as well as variations based\non the intersection of gender identity and country. For example, “Driver; Warehouse; Laborer;\nDelivery” consistently skews towards men, while “Interpreter; Translator” tends to skew toward\nwomen across most countries. “Analyst; Marketing; Manager; Data, ” “Physical; Therapist; Therapy;\n9\nEAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA A. Salinas et al.\nFig. 6. Probabilities of each job type being offered, conditioned on nationality. We generate 100 job recommen-\ndations for each nationality, 50 recommendations using he/him pronouns and 50 using she/her pronouns, and\ncompute the probability of a given job type appearing in a recommendation. We display these probabilities\nfor all three prompts. (Prompt 1 - Top; Prompt 2 - Middle; Prompt 3 - Bottom)\nOccupational, ” and “Engineer; Software; Quality; Assurance” generally exhibit balanced recommen-\ndations across gender identities for all countries, except in the case of Mexico, where “Physical;\nTherapist; Therapy; Occupational” and “Engineer; Software; Quality; Assurance” are recommended\nmore frequently, and in some cases exclusively, to women. Since these three job categories are\namong the most frequently recommended, it is expected that the distribution is relatively even for\nmost countries.\nLLaMA also presents interesting patterns. While “Care; Nurse; Physician; Health” is the sec-\nond most frequently recommended job type across all prompts, there is a slight skew towards\nrecommending this role to women across most countries. Similar to ChatGPT, “Teacher; Language;\nInstructor; Chinese” also exhibits a bias towards women, although the bias is less pronounced in\nLLaMA. Additionally, we observe variations in recommendations depending on the prompt type.\nFor example, “Counselor; Abuse; Alcohol; Admissions” recommendations skew towards women in\nprompt 2 and towards men in prompt 3.\n10\nThe Unequal Opportunities of Large Language Models EAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA\nFig. 7. Probabilities of each job type being offered to a man versus a woman, conditioned on nationality. We\ngenerate 50 job recommendations for each gender identity and nationality pair. Lighter blue corresponds to a\nhigher likelihood for the job type to be offered to men while light orange corresponds to a lower likelihood\nfor men. Darker colors and black correspond to an even likelihood between men and women. White cells\nindicate that job type was never offered to anyone with that nationality, for the given prompt. We display\nthese probabilities for all three prompts. (Prompt 1 - Top; Prompt 2 - Middle; Prompt 3 - Bottom)\n4.6 Salary Analysis\nIn addition to collecting job recommendations, we requested information about job salaries from\nthe models. Table 2 presents the median salary across the intersections of nationality and gender\nidentity, along with their associated z-scores. While there is variance in the salary distributions\nacross countries and gender identities, the distributions generally exhibit similar patterns for both\nmodels, with a few exceptions. Across all prompts, Mexico consistently has the lowest median\nsalary recommendations. This bias is more pronounced in ChatGPT, where the distribution of\nrecommended salaries skews lower across all prompts. In contrast, LLaMA tends to exhibit a fairer\nsalary distribution across all nationalities, although it also offers a much broader range of potential\nsalaries. Notably, LLaMA generates highly competitive high-salary positions, such as “Officer; Chief;\nLoan; Police” roles with salaries exceeding $1 million, while ChatGPT provides more practical and\ngenerally reasonable recommendations for the average person.\n11\nEAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA A.

Median salary and z-score across Nationality and Gender Identity-based job recommendations.\n4.7 Real-World Labor Data Comparison\nTo evaluate whether the models reflect biases present in the real world, we compared our generated\njob recommendations for men and women to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2021 annual\naverages 2. Figure 8 presents this analysis for all recommended jobs that exactly match any labor\ndata title. We note that the median salary was not always provided in the labor data, limiting the\njobs analyzed in our salary comparisons. We found that the ratio of ChatGPT’s recommendations\noften correlated real-world gender distributions. In other words, if men were overrepresented in\na specific field the labor data, ChatGPT would often recommend that job type more frequently\nfor men. LLaMA followed a similar pattern, although with some exceptions like slightly favoring\nwomen for the disproportionately male dominated jobs of Police Officer or Engineer. Both models\ntended to underestimate real-world salary inequity. In fact, ChatGPT provided almost equal salary\nestimates for both men and women. LLaMA, on the other hand, provided uneven salaries for men\nand women, although these differences were less than real-world disparities.\n5 LIMITATIONS\nOur work primarily focuses on measuring demographic bias related to nationality and gender iden-\ntity within the context of job recommendations. While we have identified biases at the intersection\nof nationality and gender identity in this specific task, it is important to recognize that biases may\n2https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2021/home.htm#table-2\n12\nThe Unequal Opportunities of Large Language Models EAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA\n(a) ChatGPT Job Distribution\n (b) LLaMA Job Distribution\n(c) ChatGPT Salary Comparison\n (d) LLaMA Salary Comparison\nFig. 8. Ratios of LLM bias compared to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2021 annual averages. LLM-\ngenerated job recommendations are only considered if they exactly match the job title within the labor data.\nIf the labor data represents several jobs with one title (i.e., “Plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters”), only one\nof the jobs within the title must be matched. Some jobs represented in the labor data did not include salary\ninformation, leading to their omission in the salary comparisons.\ndiffer significantly in other types of tasks. Additionally, biases within the job recommendation\ntask could vary depending on the phrasing of the templates used, even if they convey the same\nsemantic meaning. Furthermore, our measurement of demographic bias is limited to a specific set\nof twenty nationalities and two gender identities. Expanding the scope of measured demographic\ngroups within each axis and considering additional types of demographic biases would be valuable\nfor future research.\n6 FUTURE WORK\nIn future work, we aim to broaden the types of demographic biases we measure, beyond nationality\nand gender identity, in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the biases present\nin LLMs. Additionally, we plan to increase the number of demographic groups considered within\neach demographic axis to capture a more diverse range of identities. Furthermore, we recognize\nthe need to evolve our analysis methodology by reducing reliance on template-based approaches\nand incorporating more robust techniques. This would involve developing bias benchmarks that\nare less susceptible to model optimization or manipulation of specific templates, ensuring that the\nevaluation remains effective even as models evolve. Lastly, the pronounced bias towards Mexican\nworkers identified in our study raises concerns and warrants further investigation. We propose\nconducting in-depth research to gain a comprehensive understanding of the types of biases these\n13\nEAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA A. Salinas et al.\nlanguage models hold against Mexicans, and to develop mitigation strategies to address and prevent\nsuch intensified bias in the future.\n7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nOur analysis of job recommendations generated by ChatGPT and LLaMA revealed distinct charac-\nteristics. ChatGPT provided 614 practical job suggestions from a limited set of fields, while LLaMA\nsuggested a wider diversity of real-world professions, totaling 6,106 unique jobs. However, LLaMA’s\nrecommendations also included impractical and nonsensical suggestions, such as “Arabian Princess, ”\nindicating a trade-off between diversity and practicality.\nOur observations revealed a noteworthy impact of any mention of nationality on job recommen-\ndation probabilities compared to the baseline. Initially, we expected the baseline results to reflect\nan average of all other nationality-specific results. However, we found that both the job recommen-\ndations and the salaries provided by the baseline were outliers in relation to the nationality-specific\nresults.\nThis effect was particularly pronounced with ChatGPT, aligning with previous findings [28] which\ndemonstrate how minor template variations can impact results. While the nationality templates\ndiffered from each other by only a single word (the nationality itself), the baseline differed by\nmultiple words (see Table 1). Despite preserving overall semantics, these minor differences led to\ndistributionally distinct results.\nWhile LLaMA showed less overall bias across different countries, its recommendations seemed\nmore random and impractical compared to ChatGPT. Given that the prompts do not include\ninformation about the candidates’ skills or backgrounds, it is surprising for LLaMA to recommend\nC-suite level positions, often with 7-figure salaries, without first inquiring for further details such\nas qualifications.\nBoth models displayed a unique bias toward Mexicans, both in the types of jobs recommended and\nthe salaries provided, reflecting historical labor market discrimination toward Mexican Americans\n[2, 25]. As these models are trained on media sources and social media, bias toward Mexican\nAmericans was likely exacerbated by demonization and “social othering” of Mexican Americans in\nrecent years [11, 17, 23]. These biases are clearly actively and implicitly propagated through these\nLLMs. This further demonstrates the importance of mitigating bias to prevent the reinforcement\nand exacerbation of existing societal bias and discrimination through LLMs.\nIn conclusion, as the deployment of LLMs increases, mitigating bias becomes crucial. Our findings\nhighlight the importance of excluding potentially biasing information from prompts. Strategic\nprompt engineering and filtering can lead to fairer outcomes for diverse user groups.\nWe demonstrate the mere mention of nationality or gender identity can significantly skew\nresults, and developers should be hyper-aware of introducing biases into the system. If demographic\nattributes are necessary, developers should critically evaluate how to incorporate this information\nfairly and conduct experiments to understand and address biases.\nWhile it is challenging to remove all bias, developers must take the time to comprehend and\nreflect on the potential downstream impact and harm. As natural language becomes more prevalent\nin interactions with models, addressing bias in LLMs is essential to ensure equitable and responsible\nAI systems.\n8 ETHICAL IMPACTS AND PRECAUTIONS\nThe paper investigates the ethical implications of utilizing cutting-edge language models in practical\napplications, a widespread practice that could result in unjust consequences for particular demo-\ngraphic groups. By detecting how these language models display various kinds of biases towards\ndistinct intersectionalities, we showcase the need for exercising caution when incorporating these\n14\nThe Unequal Opportunities of Large Language Models EAAMO ’23, October 30-November 1, 2023, Boston, MA, USA\nmodels into real-world scenarios to avoid the utilization of redundant demographic information\nthat could lead to discrimination. Since there are no human subjects involved, this study does not\nrequire review and approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis project was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under\nContract No. HR00112290021.
