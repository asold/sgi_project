INTRODUCTION \nANDSLIDE susceptibility is a measure of the likelihood \nof landslides occurring in a specific area based on local \nconditions, indicating the potential impact of slope \nmovement on the landscape [1]. It serves as a predictive tool, \n \nThis work was funded in part by the National Natural Science Foundation \nof China under Grant 62371430, Grant 62071439; in part by the Opening fund \nof State Key Laboratory of Geohazard Prevention and Geoenvironment  \nProtection (Chengdu University of Technology), SKLGP2022K016;  in part by \nthe Open Fund of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science (Grant \nNo.OFSLRSS202207); in part by the Open Fund of Badong National \nObservation and Research Station of Geohazards (No. BNORSG -202302); in \npart by Opening Fu nd of the Key Laboratory of National Geographic Census \nand Monitoring, Ministry of Natural Resources, 2023NGCM11. \n(Corresponding author: Tao Chen, Gang Liu.) \nTao Chen is with the School of Geophysics and Geomatics, China \nUniversity of Geosciences, Wuhan 43 0074, China, also with the Badong \nNational Observation and Research Station of Geohazards, China University of \nGeosciences, Wuhan 430074, China, also with the Key Laboratory of National \nGeographic Census and Monitoring, Ministry of Natural Resources, Wuhan  \nestimating the areas where landslide s are prone to happen. On \nAugust 8, 2017, the Jiuzhaigou County  in China experienced a \ndevastating earthquake with a magnitude of 7. This seismic \nevent triggered a significant number of co -seismic landslides \nand resulted in the emergence of numerous potential landslide \nhazards. Landslide susceptibility assessment (LSA) plays a  \npivotal role as the cornerstone of landslide disaster risk \nassessment. It provides valuable insights to decision -makers \ninvolved in disaster management and facility construction \nplanning [2]. \nThe significance of LSA extends to regional disaster \nprevention and mitigation efforts, actively contributing to the \nreduction of future landslide risks in the Jiuzhaigou area. \nRecent advances in LSA research can be divided into three \nareas: statistical methods  (STMs), machine learning (ML) \nmodels, and deep learning ( DL) models. STMs entail the \ninference of data relationships and offer advantages such as \nsimplicity and strong interpretability. The earliest origins of \nLSA research can be traced back to methods like Logistic \nRegression (LR) [3] -[5], Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) \n[6], [7], Information Value (IV) [5], Weight of Evidence \n(WOE) [8], and Frequency Ratio (FR) [9] -[11]. While STMs \nhold several advantages, they also come with some common \nlimitations, including cumbersome procedural steps, lower \ncomputational efficiency, and reduced precision. \nIn recent years, many scholars have applied machine learning \n(ML) models to the field of LSA [12], [13]. In comparison to \nSTMs, ML techniques prioritize computational efficiency and \naccuracy over interpretability. ML methods commonly \nemployed in LSA encompass Artificial Neural Network s \n(ANNs) [14], [15], Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [16], [17] \nand Random Forest s (RFs) [1 8], [19].

However, before deploying a model into the network, \nfeature engineering becomes imperative to reduce feature \ncomplexity and enhance the prominence of relevant features. \nThis task, although crucial, can be challenging and resource -\nintensive. \nDL is a subset of ML that employs deep neural networks to \ncreate more complex models, thereby achieving a deeper \nunderstanding of the underlying data. While it demands \npowerful hardware resources , DL eliminates the need for \nextensive feature engineering and excels when dealing with \nlarge datasets. DL can be categorized into five main types: \nCNN-based (Convolutional Neural Networks) [20]-[24], RNN-\nbased (Recurrent Neural Networks)  [25], [26], DG (D eep \nGenerative Models) [27]-[29], GNN (Graph Neural Networks)  \n[30], and attention -based mechanisms  [31]-[33]. [34] \nconducted the LSA of Jiuzhaigou County based on the \ntransformer model and discovered that its accuracy surpassed \nthat of the traditional ML model significantly . [35] proposed a \nfeature fusion transformer module built on the basis of the \ntransformer framework foundation to fuse all LCFs spatial \ninformation features.  [36] introduced a spatiotemporal \ntransformer (ST-transformer) aimed at enhancing the temporal \nprobability prediction of landslides, thereby effectively \nimproving the accuracy of landslide hazard assessment. \nWith the continuous improvement of computing power, DL \nhas achieved great success in the computer vision field and has \nbeen widely used in LSA  tasks. However, these DL models \nmainly focus on CNN -based and RNN -based models, which \nextract deep information by stacking convolutional layers, \nfocusing only on local associations and failing to make effective \nuse of global information [3 7], [3 8]. Compared with these \nmodels, Transformer model does not contain convolution, \npooling or cyclic operations, which makes it have better \nparallelism and interpretability when processing sequence data. \nAt the same time, the self -attention mechanism can capture \ndependencies between different positions in the input sequence, \nwhich allows the Transformer to better handle global contextual \ninformation in visual tasks. Swin Transformer (Swin-T) stands \nas an enhancement over traditional Transformer models, which \nhas powerful nonlinear and multi -scale feature extraction \ncapability when compared to  other DL models.  Swin-T \nemploys a local attention window strategy to effectively capture \nlocal information while processing large -scale images. This \napproach serves to mitigate computational complexity and \nenhance model efficiency.  In addition, Swin -T introduces a \ncross-layer connectivity mechanism, enabling information \nexchange across different lev els within the model architecture. \nThis enhances feature reusability and contributes to overall \nperformance improvements. \nBased on this , we propose a new framework that integrates \nlandslide conditioning factors (LCFs) with the Swin -T. The \nmain contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: \n1) we introduce a hybrid framework named LCFSTE, which \ncombines LCFs and Swin-T for LSA; 2) the proposed LCFSTE \nis applied to LSA in a landslide-prone area, improving the LSA \naccuracy of the framework. \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section \nII comprehensively introduces the study areas and overviews \nthe datasets employed in  the experiments. Section III outlines \nthe experimental steps undertaken to develop the new \nframework. Section IV analyzes the experimental results in \ndetail, presenting both qualitative and quantitative findings. \nFinally, Section V concludes the paper with some remarks. \nII. STUDY AREA AND DATA \nA. Study Area \nThe study area (Fig. 1) is in a region of Jiuzhaigou County, \nsituated in the northern Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous \nPrefecture, Sichuan province, China. The area lies within the \nlatitude of 33°5′59″-33°14′58″N and longitude of 103°42′13″ -\n103°51′53″E, covering an area of 250 km2. The region features \na river system, with the Bai he river running across the entire \ncounty and flowing into the Baishuihe river. It is a typical deep-\nincised valley lo cated in the transition zone between the \nQinghai-Tibet Plateau, Western Sichuan Plateau, mountains, \nand Sichuan Basin. Its elevation varies from 2641 m to 4455 m, \nwith a peak difference of 1814 m. As a result, this location \npresents various morphological p rocesses and landforms, \nmaking it prone to the development of geo -hydrological \nhazards. \nB. Landslide inventory map \nIn this study, the landslide inventory map was obtained \nthrough the visual interpretation from pre - and post -event \nGoogle Earth image s (Fig. 1). A total of 2171 landslides were \nidentified, covering a combined area of 8.392 Km2. The largest \nlandslide in terms of area was 0.5265 square kilometers, while \nthe smallest measured 13.9581 square meters.  Most of the \nlandslides in the study area are relatively small and are \nconcentrated in the vicinity of the epicenter, fault zones, and \nvalley slopes.  \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

Location of the study area. \nC. Landslide conditioning factors \nDue to the complexity of landslide development mechanisms \nand the differences between landslide types, there are no \nguidelines for selecting LCFs. In this study, based on previous \nstudies and expert knowledge, 11 L CFs were selected: \nelevation, slope,  terrain relief  (TER), aspect, plan curvature  \n(PLC), profile curvature  (PRC), distance to faults (DTF), \nlithology, distance to rivers (DTR) , modified normalized \ndifference water index (MNDWI),  and normalized difference \nvegetation index (NDVI) . The first six factors were extracted \nfrom the digital elevation model (DEM)  with a spatial \nresolution of 30 m, which was downloaded from geospatial data \ncloud (http://www.gscloud.cn/search). The fault and lithology \ndata were obtained by vectorization, based on the 1:200 ,000 \nscale geological map database of the National Geological \nArchive (http://www.ngac.org.cn/Map/List). The river vector \nillustration was modified based on the 1:250,000 scale national \nbasic geographic database, combined with pre -earthquake \nremote sensing image data. Additionally, Landsat 8 OLI Image \nwas used to obtain MNDWI and NDVI data.

METHODOLOGY \nThe proposed LCFSTE framework encompasses three main \nparts (Fig. 2). The first part is data processing, which includes data \npreprocessing, LCFs selection, and dataset creation for the \nLCFSTE. The second part of the framework ensembles the LCFs \nand Swin-T algorithms. Finally, model evaluation is conducted in \nthe third part of the framework. Seven evaluation metrics (EMs) \nare employed to compare the performance of our proposed \nLCFSTE framework to that of other four DL methods. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

Flowchart of LCFSTE. \nA. Data preprocessing \nIn our framework, data preprocessing involves two essential \nsteps: resampling and image standardization. To ensure \nuniform row and column numbers, resampling is conducted \nusing the bilinear interpolation method, accounting for \nvariations in data resolution [ 39]. Following resampling, all \ninput data undergo standardization using the Z -score method, \nthereby achieving a consistent data distribution with a mean of \n0 a nd a variance of 1. This standardization harmonizes data \ndistributions across different dimensions and accelerates model \nconvergence [40].  \nB. LCFs selection \nThe process of selecting factors plays a pivotal role in \ndetermining the overall performance of the model. On one \nhand, a substantial presence of noise, characterized by factors \nwith negligible or zero contribution rates in the dataset, can \nsignificantly distort the model's predictive outcomes, impeding \nthe accurate assimilation of gen uine landslide characteristics. \nOn the other hand, robust interconnections among the factors \nmay introduce data redundancy, ultimately diminishing the \nmodel's efficiency and exerting an influence on the allocation \nof feature weights throughout the learning  process [ 41]. \nConsequently, in this study we performed collinearity testing \nand importance analysis on the LCFs prior to the construction \nof the landslide sample datasets. \n1) Multi-collinearity Test: Multi-collinearity is used to test \nwhether there is non -perfect collinearity between LCFs. It can \nbe judged by VIF  (Variance Inflation Factor)  or Tol \n(Tolerance). VIF is calculated as shown in Eq. (1). Tol is the \nreciprocal of the VIF. \nVIF =\n1\n1−𝑅𝑖\n2                                   (1) \n𝑅2 = 1 −\n∑  𝑛\n𝑖=1 (𝑦𝑖−𝑦̂𝑖)2\n∑  𝑛\n𝑖=1 (𝑦𝑖−𝑦̅)2                              (2) \nwhere 𝑦𝑖 refers to the actual value, 𝑦̂𝑖 is the predicted value, and \n𝑦 refers to the average value. \nIn general, the calculation result of 𝑅𝑖\n2 is between 0 and 1. \nThe closer 𝑅𝑖\n2 is to 1, the greater th e number of independent \nvariables that can be obtained through linear regression of other \nindependent variables. Generally, a factor should be removed \nwhen its VIF exceeds 10 or 5.  \n2) Importance Analysis: To assess the influence of each LCF \non the performance of model, a comprehensive importance \nanalysis of the 11 LCFs was conducted prior to model \nconstruction. In this study, we employed the information gain \nratio (IGR) to determine the contribution of these LCFs  to a \nlandslide event [42]. The higher the value of a specific element, \nthe more significant the corresponding LCF's contribution to \nthe LSA model. \nC. Dataset construction \nAfter extracting LCFs through data preprocessing and LCF \nanalysis, it is essential to create a dataset before feeding it into \nthe model. Given the spatial correlations of landslides at the \npixel level, this study constructs the dataset using three -\ndimensional sample blocks. To begin, the LCFs are assembled \ninto a three-dimensional matrix (H, W, C), with H representing \nheight, W representing width, and C indicating the number of \nchannels (which corresponds to the number of LCFs ). The \nsubsequent steps involve patch generation  and augmentation : \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

If they match, \nthe sample is retained; if there is a mismatch, it is considered an \ninvalid sample. Following this evaluation, all landslide samples \nare selected, along with an eq ual number of non -landslide \nsamples. Subsequently, seven methods are employed for data \naugmentation, including 90° , 180° , and 270°  rotations, left-\nright mirroring, and mirroring followed by 90° , 180° , and 270°  \nrotations, effectively expanding the sample li brary to eight \ntimes its original size . Finally, the sample set is divided into \ntraining, validation, and test sets in a 6:2:2 ratio. \nD. LeNet \nLeNet is a relatively straightforward CNN, initially designed \nfor recognizing handwritten text [ 43]. The classic LeNet -5 \narchitecture comprises two two -dimensional convolutional \nlayers for extracting features, each followed by a down -\nsampling layer, as well as a pooling layer for reducing feature \ndimensionality (Fig. 3). Ultimately, it incorporates a classifi er \nconsisting of two fully connected layers and a Gaussian \nconnected layer to produce classification results. \n \nFig. 3. Network structure of LeNet. \nE. VGG \nThe VGG network employs a series of small consecutive \nconvolutional kernels (3x3) and maximum pool layer s (2x2) to \nbuild a deep neural network [ 44]. This architectural design \nallows for a total depth of either 16 layers or 19 layers . In our \nwork, we employed the VGG16 model to map the landslide \nsusceptibility, since it is one of the most widely used VGG \nnetworks. VGG16 consists of 16 hidden layers , including 13 \nconvolutional layers (Conv-3) and pooling layers, followed by \n3 fully connected layers  (FC). The Network structure of VGG \nis shown in Fig. 4. \n \nFig. 4. Network structure of VGG. \nF. ResNet \nResNet effectively addresses the challenges of gradient \nvanishing and exploding in the training of deep neural networks \nby introducing skip connections within the network architecture, \nresulting in significant enhancements in model performance  \n[23]. At the heart of ResNet lies the Residual Block, comprised \nof two convolutional layers. Notably, the output of the second \nconvolutional layer is combined with the input, creating a \ncrucial junction that enables the residual block to glean and \nlearn residual information . Finally, there is a global average \npooling layer and a fully connected layer for classification. \nThe specific network employed in this study is ResNet50, \ndistinguished by its inclusion of 50 convolutional and fully \nconnected layers. This substantial depth empowers the network \nto capture and comprehend progressively intricate and abstract \nfeatures. The ResNet network architecture is shown in Fig. 5. \n \nFig. 5. Network structure of ResNet. \nG. DenseNet \nDenseNet's defining feature lies in the interconnections \nbetween every layer of dense layers. These dense connections \nwithin the Dense Block not only mitigate the vanishing gradient \nproblem but also bolster feature propagation [45]. Furthermore, \nDenseNet incorporates a structure known as the Dense Block -\nTransition to maintain consistent feature map sizes at each layer. \nTransition encompasses transition layers, comprised of a 1x1 \nconvolution layer and a max -pooling layer. In pursuit of \nenhanced computational efficienc y, the DenseNet -BC variant \nwas conceived, with 'B' signifying 'Bottleneck.' This variant \ncomprises only two convolution layers, each with a preceding \n1x1 convolution step to replace the conventional dense layer. \nThe DenseNet architecture employed in this study is elucidated \nin Fig.6, where the quantity of Dense Blocks in Stages 1 \nthrough 4 is specified as (6, 12, 24, 16). \n \nFig. 6. Network structure of DenseNet. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

LCFSTE \nBy integrating LCFs and Swin -T, the LCFSTE model not \nonly enhances the accuracy of landslide susceptibility \nassessments but also significantly improves computational \nefficiency. The second part of Fig.2 illustrates the specific \nstructure of LCFSTE. In the context of LCFSTE,  the Swin-T \nnetwork structure plays a pivotal role in feature extraction. The \nkey breakthrough of Swin -T lies in its innovative hierarchical \ngrouping attention mechanism, which empowers LCFSTE to \nefficiently handle large -scale, high -resolution images and \ncapture global landslide features while demanding fewer \ncomputational resources. \nWhen dealing with a patch block composed of LCFs, \nLCFSTE initiates the process by dividing the patch block into \nnon-overlapping image blocks through Patch Par tition. \nSubsequently, LCFSTE is organized into four stages, with each \nstage comprising Patch Merging and multiple Swin -T blocks. \nThe specific architecture of these blocks is visually depicted in \nFig. 7 . It includes essential components like Layer Norm, \nMulti-Layer Perceptron ( MLP), Window Multi -head Self \nAttention (W -MSA), and Shifted Window Multi -Head Self \nAttention (SW -MSA). Both W -MSA and SW -MSA compute \nthe MSA within the window. SW -MSA, on the other hand, \nensures connectivity among non -overlapping windows and re-\ncalculates self-attention within the window of the shifted \nfeature map. These two Swin -T modules are interconverted to \nfacilitate information exchange between neighboring blocks. \n   \nFig. 7. Network Structure of two connected Swin-T blocks. \nI. Experimental environment and hyperparameter \noptimization \nTable II presents the computer hardware employed in the \nexperiments conducted in this study. The software was \ndeveloped within the Python 3.6.2 environment and built on the \nPyCharm 2021 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015  software \nplatform. The experiments were executed on the Linux-Ubuntu \n18.04.05 LTS operating system. Furthermore, PyTorch was \ninstalled as the primary artificial intelligence develo pment \nframework, with Keras and TensorFlow serving as \nsupplementary tools. \nTABLE II \nCOMPUTER HARDWARE INFORMATION \nItem Parameter \nCPU Intel Xeon(R) Silver 4210R CPU@2.4GHZ× 40 \nGPU GeForce RTX 3090/PCle/SSE2 \nMemory 128GB \nHard disk 8TB \nOptimizing hyperparameters represents a pivotal phase in \nmodel debugging, as the right combination can yield maximum \nmodel performance. In this research, we employed the cross -\nentropy function as loss function . Stochastic Gradient Descent \nalgorithm was chosen as the optimizer as it not only converges \nrapidly, but also displayed strong performance across various \naccuracy metrics. The initial learning rate set to 0.00007 and the \nbatch size set to 32 for each learning iteration. The network was \ntrained for 100 epochs, and the loss value on the validation set \nwas monitored during training. \nJ. Model evaluation metrics \nIn this study, seven EMs were selected to access the \nperformance of the LSA model, which were overall accuracy \n(OA), Precision (Pr), Recall  (Re), F1 score (F1), Matthews \ncorrelation coefficient (MCC), Kappa coefficient (Kappa), and \nAUC. These seven EMs are defined as follows: \n1) OA. It measures the proportion of correct predictions made \nby a model over the total predictions.  The calculation of OA is \nshown in Eq. (3).  \n𝑂𝐴 =\n𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑁                              (3) \nwhere TP (Ture Positive) represents correctly predicted \nlandslide samples, and TN (True Negative) stands for correctly \npredicted non-landslide samples. A False Positive (FP) occurs \nwhen the actual value is a non -landslide, but the model \nincorrectly predicts the sample as a landslide. A False Negative \n(FN) arises when the actual value is a landslide, but the model \nincorrectly predicts the sample as a non-landslide. \n2) Pr. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted landslide \nobservations to the total predi cted landslide sample. Precision \nis calculated by Eq. (4). \n𝑃𝑟 =\n𝑇𝑃\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃                                       (4) \n3) Re . Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted landslide \nobservations to the actual landslide samples [Eq. (5)].  \n𝑅𝑒 =\n𝑇𝑃\n𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁                                       (5) \n4) F1. F1 score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. \nIt's a single metric that combines both Precision and Recall into \none value. It is calculated as follows: \n𝐹1 = 2 ∗\n𝑃𝑟∗𝑅𝑒\n𝑃𝑟+𝑅𝑒                                       (6) \n5) MCC. Matthews correlation coefficient takes into account \nTP, TN, FP, and FN and ranges from -1 to 1. An MCC of 1 \nrepresents a perfect prediction, 0 is equivalent to random \nprediction, and -1 indicates total disagreement between \nprediction and observation.  MCC can be obtained through Eq. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

It is used to evaluate the \nperformance of binary classification models and represents the \nmodel's ability to distinguish between positive and negative \nclasses. AUCs close to 1 indicate high accuracy, while closer to \n0.5 indicate low accuracy. \nIV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS \nA. Analysis of LCFs \n1) Multi -collinearity test of LCFs.  The factor collinearity \nindexes of the study were calculated. The results in Table III \nshow the Tol and VIF values of the study area. It can be seen \nthat the VIF values of all LCFs are less than 5, which indicates \nthat there is no need to remove any LCF. \nTABLE III \nRESULTS OF FACTOR MULTI-COLLINEARITY TEST \nLCFs VIF Tol \nElevation 2.316 0.432 \nSlope 2.478 0.404 \nTEF 2.541 0.393 \nAspect 1.214 0.824 \nPLC 1.197 0.835 \nPRC 1.224 0.817 \nDTF 1.438 0.695 \nLithology 1.103 0.907 \nDTR 1.252 0.799 \nMNDWI 1.605 0.623 \nNDVI 2.19 0.457 \n2) Importance analysis of LCFs : The illustration in Fig. 8  \ndisplays the distribution of importance rankings for each LCF \nin the study area. Observably, the lithology factor holds the \nhighest IGR value (0.0130), indicating its paramount \ncontribution to the model. Next in rank are the MNDWI and \nNDVI factors, both at 0.0115, followed by the planar curvature \nand profile curvature  factors. The elevation and terrain relief \nfactors exhibit the lowest IGR values (both at 0.0015), \nindicating their comparatively minimal contribution to the \nmodeling process. \n \nFig. 8. Importance ranking distribution of each LCFs. \nB. Comparison of LSA results \nThe landslide susceptibility maps are obtained by using the \nfive LSA models. Then the natural breakpoint method [45]-[47] \nwas used to divide the susceptibility category into five levels: \nvery high (VH), high (HI), moderate (MO), low (LO), and very \nlow (VL) ( Fig. 9 ). Based on the classification results of the \nnatural breakpoint method, the classification thresholds for \nlandslide susceptibility values obtained by LCFSTE are 0.10, \n0.31, 0.56, and 0.81, respectively. \nThe area of VH zone is concentrated in and around the \nlandslide sites, with HI and MO susceptibility category \nradiating outward. The LO and VL susceptibility areas covering \nthe largest extent, with some scattered small landslides.  \nHowever, it can be seen that the grain size of the susceptible \nregions in ResNet is significantly coarser compared to the other \nfour LSA models. This suggests that the transition of the region \nis not smooth. The VH areas of large landslides are connected \ntogether, with the finest grain size observed in LCFSTE. \nAdditionally, the LSA results of LeNet seems not reasonable, \nas the central areas of some large landsli des are categorized as \nMO even LO susceptible areas rather than VH areas.  \nAdditionally, the LSA results of LeNet seems not reasonable, \nas the central areas of some large landslides are categorized as \nHI susceptible areas rather than VI areas. Therefore, vi sually, \nLCFSTE is the most reliable among the five LSA models. \nSpecifically with regard to the distribution of LSA results \nfrom the LCFSTE model, from a lithologic perspective, it can \nbe found that HI and VH zones are mostly distributed within \nCarboniferous System, which is consistent with the fact that \nCarboniferous System are usually susceptible to erosion.  In \nterms of topography, HI and VH zones are mostly located in \nareas of undulating terrain and high slopes.  This illustrates the \nimportance of topographic elements for LSA. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

Model performance evaluation \nAssessing the metrics of OA, Precision, Recall, F1, MCC, \nand Kappa (Table IV), the LCFSTE model showcases \nsuperior values across most indicators. Notably, the ResNet \nmodel exhibits the highest Recall value. The OA of the \nLCFSTE model stands at approximatel y 87.39%, with \nDenseNet following at 86.26%, ResNet at 85.51%, and the \nLeNet and VGG models ranking the lowest at 84.29%. \nTABLE IV \nEMS OF ALL LSA MODELS (THE BOLDED AND UNDERLINED \nVALUE MEANS THE HIGHEST EMS OF THE ROW) \n            EMs \nModel OA Pr Re F1 MCC Kappa AUC \nLeNet 0.8429  0.7955  0.9232  0.8546  0.6949  0.6859  0.9238  \nVGG 0.8429  0.8144  0.8883  0.8497  0.6887  0.6859  0.8681  \nResNet 0.8551  0.8083  0.9311  0.8654  0.7186  0.7103  0.9292  \nDenseNet 0.8626  0.8274  0.9162  0.8696  0.7293  0.7251  0.9382  \nLCFSTE 0.8739  0.8475  0.9119  0.8785  0.7500  0.7478  0.9444  \nIn terms of Recall, the ResNet  model attains the highest \nvalue at 0.9311, followed by LeNet at 0.9232, DenseNet at \n0.9162, LCFSTE at 0.9119, and the least favorable value of \n0.8883 from the VGG model. Additionally, other indicators \nsuch as Precision, Kappa, F1, and MCC follow a similar  \ntrend as OA across the models, affirming that the LCFSTE \nmodel demonstrates superior predictive capabilities. Hence, \nit stands out as the most promising model for LSA task. \nThe ROC curves displaying the performance of five LSA \nmodels using the testing dataset are presented in Fig. 10. The \nLCTSTE model leads with the highest AUC value of 0.9444, \nfollowed by DenseNet at 0.9382, ResNet at 0.9292, LeNet \nat 0.9238, and the lowest AUC is attributed to VGG, \nregistering 0.8681. \nBased on the above findings, it is clear that the  LCFSTE \nmodel achieves the overall best performance  among these \nfive LSA models, since it resulted in the  six highest \naccuracies out of the seven EMs. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

The ROC curves and AUC values on the testing \ndataset of the five LSA models. \nV. DISCUSSIONS \nIn this study, the performance of the LCFSTE framework \nrepresent a remarkable advance than the other comparable \nmodels and models proposed by other scholars. For example, \nKikuchi et al reported an AUC value of 0.911 for thei r CNN \nmodel [48], while our LCFSTE model achieved an AUC value \nof 0.94, which shows that the optimization of model mechanism \ncan improve the prediction accuracy. Chen et al explore the \npotential applications of CNN hybrid ensemble metaheuristic \noptimization algorithms, namely beluga whale optimization \nand coati optimization algorithm, for landslide susceptibility \nmapping [49]. The AUC values of the two optimized models \nare 0.906 and 0.919 respectively, which are lower than the \nLCFSTE model that has not been optimized in this paper, \nreflecting the excellent performance of the LCFSTE model. \nWhile the LCFSTE framework we introduced demonstrated \nrobust performance in LSA, it faces significant challenges \nwithin this domain. Firstly, the selection of LCFs may introduce \nuncertainties in the LSA due to variations in the importance of \neach LCF among the five methods (Fig. 9). Lithology emerges \nwith the highest importance index, followed by NDVI, \nMNDWI, PLC, PRC, aspect, DTF, slope, and DTR. El evation \nand TER, on the other hand, register the lowest importance \nindices. This implies that in the study area, lithology \nsignificantly influences LSA, as different rock types have \nvarying impacts on landslide occurrences. Despite efforts to \ncalculate the  importance of each LCF, discrepancies persist, \nintroducing errors and diminishing LSA accuracy [50]-[52]. \nSecondly, our work did not classify different types of landslides \nwhen applying the five LSA methods, potentially introducing \nuncertainty. Prior stud ies have shown that landslide \nsusceptibility can be more accurately assessed by considering \nindividual types based on their distinct spatial incidences [4], \n[53]. Thirdly, the absence of complete and coherent landslide \ninventory data in the area introduces further uncertainties. This \ndeficiency may lead to unidentified new landslides in the study \narea, which might not be accounted for in existing landslide \ninventory datasets. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS \nIn this paper, we proposed a new LCFSTE hybrid framework, \nwhich ensemble s LCFs and Swin -T for LSA.  We selected \nJiuzhaigou County as our study area and constructed a dataset \nthat included  historical landslide data and eleven LCFs. We \nthen conducted multicollinearity test and importance analysis to \nscreen the LCFs . Subsequently, the dataset was divided into \nthree subsets for training, validation, and testing. To \nquantitatively assess the performance of the LCFSTE \nframework, we employed seven EMs and compared its results \nwith four other DL models . The LSA results show that the \nspatial distribution of historical landslides and the VH and H \nzones obtained from the LCFSTE framework are in general \nagreement. Statistically, the LCFSTE framework outperforms \nthe other four models in six out of the seven E Ms. These \nfindings underscore  the LCFSTE framework's exceptional \nability to extract abstract features from both landslides and \nLCFs. In summary, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of \nthe LCFSTE framework in improving the accuracy of LSA. \nREFERENCES \n[1] P. Reichenbach, M. Rossi, B. D. Malamud, M.
