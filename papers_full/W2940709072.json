CRYSTAL is theﬁrst system that can automatically\ngenerate a portfolio of physically meaningful phase diagrams for expert-user exploration and selection. CRYSTAL outperforms previous\nmethods to solve the example Pd-Rh-Ta phase diagram, enabling the discovery of a mixed-intermetallic methanol oxidation electrocatalyst.\nThe integration of multiple data-knowledge sources and learning and reasoning algorithms, combined with the exploitation of problem decom-\npositions, relaxations, and parallelism, empowers AI to supersede human scientiﬁc data interpretation capabilities and enable otherwise\ninaccessible scientiﬁc discovery in materials science and beyond.\nIntroduction\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) excels at a range of cognitive tasks,\nfrom speech and image recognition to game playing,[1,2] and\nholds great promise for automating scientiﬁc discovery.[3–8]\nThe interpretation of scientiﬁc data remains a challenge for\nAI due to both the need for intricate scientiﬁc background\nknowledge and reasoning and the lack of large annotated train-\ning datasets. AI-based reasoning and learning methods are par-\nticularly critical for the ﬁeld of high-throughput materials\nscience where automated experiments are dramatically acceler-\nating the pace of materials discovery for a variety of critical\ntechnologies.[4–6,9,10] Foundational techniques in high-\nthroughput materials discovery include simultaneous synthesis\nof hundreds to thousands of materials using co-sputtering fol-\nlowed by rapid structural characterization via synchrotron\nXRD [Fig. 1(a)]. For complex materials containing three or\nmore elements, the most common rate-limiting step in the dis-\ncovery process is the construction of a crystal phase diagram\nfrom the composition and structural characterization data. We\nrefer to this task as the phase mapping problem, which requires\nthe identiﬁcation of basis patterns (or factors) corresponding to\npure crystal phases, some of which may not be sampled sepa-\nrately, such that all the XRD measurements can be explained\nas a mixture of the basis patterns [Figs. 1(c)–1(f)]. The XRD\nmeasurements are typically noisy, which contributes to the\nchallenge of separating the basis pattern“sources” from the col-\nlection of patterns. Additionally, materials thermodynamics\nplaces a set of intricate physical constraints on the solution,\nand while synthesis of materials may not reach thermodynamic\nequilibrium, the non-equilibrium behavior is most commonly\nexhibited as the presence of non-equilibrium phases as opposed\nto deviations from, e.g., the Gibbs phase rule.\nPhase mapping has traditionally been a bottleneck of the\nhigh-throughput materials discovery cycle as the synthesis\nand characterization experiments [Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)] can be\nperformed on several libraries of materials per day while the\nmanual effort required to solve a given phase mapping problem\nlimits the throughput to only several phase diagrams per year.\nPrevious reports have detailed the shortcomings of existing\nde-mixing algorithms,\n[12] most notably in the presence of\nnoise and substantial alloying, an important phenomenon in\nwhich a range of elemental compositions crystallize into the\nsame phase, causing its basis pattern to shift systematically\nwith composition.\n[13] Non-negative matrix factorization\n(NMF) techniques[14] have shown promise in the efﬁcient\nextraction of representative diffraction patterns from large data-\nsets,[15,16] but their limited ability to encode physical con-\nstraints and prior knowledge results in routine production of\nnon-physical solutions. From a computational perspective,\nphase mapping is an example of a challenging NP-hard prob-\nlem\n[17] whose sheer number of possible combinations of\na) Current address: Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West\nLafayette, IN 47907, USA.\nb) Current address: Toyota Research Institute, Los Altos, CA 94022, USA.\nMRS Communications (2019), 9, 600–608\n© Materials Research Society, 2019\ndoi:10.1557/mrc.2019.50\n600 ▪ MRS COMMUNICATIONS  VOLUME 9  ISSUE 2  www.mrs.org/mrc\nhttps://doi.org/10.1557/mrc.2019.50 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nbasis patterns and activations grows exponentially with data\nsize, rendering monolithic solvers and traditional search meth-\nods computationally infeasible, which motivates the explora-\ntion of innovative AI approaches.\nCRYSTAL: a multi-agent AI system\nfor phase mapping\nCRYSTAL is a multi-agent AI system that can run in unsuper-\nvised or semi-supervised mode and that decomposes phase\nmapping into smaller, more tractable sub-problems that are\ntackled by nimble algorithmic bots with unique background\nknowledge and reasoning capabilities ( Fig. 2). Interleaved\nAgile Factor Decomposition ( IAFD) is CRYSTAL ’s core\nphase-mapping engine, which interleaves factor decomposition\n(AgileFD bot) with constraint enforcement ( Gibbs, Gibbs\nAlloy, andPhase Connectivity bots), whose collective reason-\ning produces physically meaningful phase maps. At a high\nlevel, IAFD relaxes and postpones the combinatorial physical\nconstraints and iteratively repairs and enforces them when\nviolations are detected.\nThe graph reasoning algorithms of theGibbs, Gibbs Alloy,\nand Phase Connectivity bots are applied at a local scale to\nenable parallel computation and ensure scalability for large\nreal-world problems. The key insight is that global maintenance\nof the combinatorial physical constraints is computationally\nprohibitive, yet appropriate data exploitation withlocal con-\nstraint enforcement provides global constraint satisfaction at\na relatively small computational expense. While generating a\nphase diagram is a confounding and time-consuming task\neven for experienced materials scientists, IAFD generates a sol-\nution typically within 2 min for the dataset reported in this\npaper, a groundbreaking advance in phase mapping since no\nother algorithm imposes the physical constraints to reliably\nyield physically meaningful solutions (see Table S1).\nThe capability to rapidly generate physically meaningful\nsolutions enables CRYSTAL’s large-scale computations to\nassess solution stability, uncovering a critical and previously\nFigure 1.

Even with the imposed\nphysical constraints, different phase diagram solutions are\noften “inadequately differentiated” by the source XRD patterns.\nInadequate differentiation in phase mapping arises in part from\nthe fundamental non-invertibility of an XRD pattern to obtain\nits crystalline phase source(s) and is compounded by both\nnoise in the source data and presence of different phases with\nsimilar basis patterns. The standard practice in phase mapping,\nand more generally in data modeling, is to extract knowledge\nfrom a single solution that sufﬁciently reconstructs the source\ndata. In contrast, CRYSTAL explores the search space by\ndeploying bots in parallel to produce a large number of candi-\ndate solutions. Using additional bots for solution analysis and\naggregation (Figs. 2–4), CRYSTAL runs unsupervised and\nautonomously to generate a parsimonious portfolio of phase\ndiagrams that represent different interpretations of the source\ndata.\nCRYSTAL’s algorithms\nAs mentioned above, CRYSTAL is a collection of nimble\nalgorithmic bots, with different knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities performing a variety of tasks outlined inFig. 2\nand described in more detail below. The IAFD bots collec-\ntively solve the phase mapping problem, using an unsuper-\nvised generative approach, to produce a phase map that\nsatisﬁes the physical constraints. The CRYSTAL planner\nlaunches parallel runs of IAFD with different random initiali-\nzations and parameters, in particular the number of target\nphases, and each IAFD run follows the algorithm outlined\nbelow and illustrated inFig. 3:\nStep 0:Initialization: Initialize the inner-loop (AgileFD-Gibbs)\ncounter CNT1, bounded above by p, together with CNT2\nwhich counts outer-loops bounded above byq, to be 0. As dis-\ncussed below,p and q are typically set to 3 and 2 respectively.\nStep 1:AgileFD bot: Apply AgileFD on randomly selectedN/p\n“untouched” samples\nStep 2:Gibbs bot: Enforce Gibbs phase constraint on theseN/p\nsamples\nStep 3: If some samples still have not been processed, namely\nCNT1 is still smaller than p, increase CNT1 by 1 and go back to\nstep 1, otherwise, move on to step 4\nStep 4:Gibbs-Alloy bot: enforce Gibbs-Alloy constraint on all\nN samples\nStep 5:Phase Connectivity bot: enforce Connectivity constraint\non allN samples\nStep 6: If Gibbs-Alloy constraint is violated, go back to step 4,\notherwise, go to step 7\nStep 7: If CNT2 hasn’t reached the upper boundq,r eﬁned solu-\ntions from Step 6 are fed into step 1 as initialization and the\nwhole algorithm starts over again. Otherwise, the IAFD output\nis taken as the phase mapﬁnalized in step 6. Further documen-\ntation and source code for IAFD can be found athttp://www.\nudiscover.it/resources/software/.\nAgileFD bot\nAs illustrated inFig. 3, we formulate phase mapping as acon-\nstrained matrix factorization problem. Experimental XRD\nmeasurements are represented by a matrixA of size L × N.\nEach column of A is a vector representing the XRD pattern\nsampled atL diffraction angles, obtained at one out ofN sample\nlocations. The phase mapping problem entails decomposingA\nin terms of factorsW and H, satisfying physics constraints.W\nencodes the characteristic patterns or structure associated with\neach pure crystalline phase andH represents the mixing param-\neters, such as the phases present, their proportions, and any\nalloying present.\nUnder the assumed“isotropic” alloying model, an XRD pat-\ntern measured as a function of scattering vector magnitude will\nFigure 2.

CRYSTAL incorporates a diverse collection of fast and specialized algorithms with different types of knowledge and\ncomputational capabilities.IAFD integrates theAgileFD, Gibbs, Gibbs Alloy, andPhase Connectivitybots, constituting CRYSTAL’s core phase-mapping engine:\nAgileFD performs agile factor decomposition to learn the factors or basis patterns, corresponding to pure crystal structures, and its three partner bots enforce\nphysical constraints. ThePhase Matchingbot matches the basis patterns discovered byIAFD to known crystal structure patterns from databases. ThePhase\nDimension Analysisbot analyzes and validates the generated phase maps and infers the system’s maximum number of pure phases, which dictates how many\nsystem conﬁgurations CRYSTAL explores, using parallelism and randomization, to produce a large number of candidate phase maps. The hierarchicalClustering\nbot uses automated thresholding to identify a small set of representative candidate solutions, which are provided to either the CRYSTAL Planner for solution\nreﬁnement or to theAnalysis & Reportingbot to generate phase diagrams and other visualizations for human-expert inspection.

We convert\nthe multiplicative shift to an additive constant by performing\nthe factorization of logarithmically transformed patterns, mak-\ning A a convolutive mixture of the bases inW. Wand H are\nnaturally non-negative, leading to aconvolutive non-negative\nmatrix factorization (CNMF) problem,\n[18] which AgileFD\nperforms using lightweight multiplicative coordinate gradient-\ndescent updating rules applied to the logarithmically transformed\nXRD data.\n[19,20]\nGibbs and Gibbs-Alloy bots\nFor a physical system wherel elements are deposited, Gibbs’\nphase rule implies that at mostl phases are present at each sam-\nple location. Mathematically, this is equivalent to constraining\nthe number of non-zero elements in the vector∑\nm\nHm\n∗,n for any\nsample locationn to be no more thanl.\nThe Gibbs bot uses a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)\napproach toﬁnd the best activation matrixH that activates no\nmore thanl phases per sample point and minimize the recon-\nstruction loss, while holding the phases inW ﬁxed.[21] Notice\nthat whenW is ﬁxed, the columns of matrixH are independent\nwhich leads to a decomposition into a smaller MIP program per\nviolated sample point, whichﬁnds the bestl phases that mini-\nmize the reconstruction loss of sample locationn, as described\nfurther in the Supplementary Information.\nThe Gibbs Alloy bot extends the Gibbs constraint by reduc-\ning the allowed number of coexisting phases allowed by one\nwhen alloying is detected, i.e., for those sample locations\nwith varying mean shift parameters compared with nearby\nlocations. This is motivated by the thermodynamic degree of\nfreedom associated with alloying, although instead of identify-\ning details of the alloying behavior, the bot identiﬁes where\nalloying is taking place and lowers the number of allowable\nphases by 1 at those composition points.\nPhase and Phase Field Connectivity\nbot\nThe Connectivity constraint requires that both (i) the sample\npoints where a speciﬁc phase is present and (ii) the sample\npoints where each unique set of phases is present form a con-\nnected component in composition space, which is determined\nusing the activations of each phase for each composition sam-\nple. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne a graphG in which sample points\nare nodes and two nearby sample points in composition\nspace are connected with an edge based on the Delaunay\nFigure 3. Solving phase mapping using an unsupervised generative approach. TheIAFD bot network solves phase mapping as a constrained matrix factorization\nproblem in which the input XRD pattern matrix (A) is decomposed into factorsW and H such thatW × H approximates A while satisfying physical constraints.W\nencodes the characteristic patterns of pure crystal phases (including shifted versions) andH their activations, which dictate both the amount and the pattern\nshifting extent of each pure phase in each XRD measurement. IAFD starts withp (typically three) rounds of interactions between theAgileFD and Gibbs bots\nfollowed by rounds of iterations between theGibbs Alloyand Phase Connectivitybots, until all the constraints are satisﬁed. AgileFD performs matrix factorization\nusing light-weight multiplicative updating rules, without enforcing the combinatorial physical constraints. The AgileFD solution’s violations of the connectivity\nconstraint and the constraints based on Gibbs’phase rule are repaired by the corresponding bots in an interleaved manner using efﬁcient algorithms (red circles\nhighlight repaired activations ofH). The entire procedure is repeated for solution reﬁnement (typically q = 2), and the resulting generated basis patterns are\npassed to thePhase Matchingbot to identify the crystal structures by comparison with ICDD and/or determine if the solution potentially contains a new phase.\nThe ﬁgure illustrates a representative XRD pattern of the Pd-Rh-Ta system (#69) that is decomposed into shifted versions of two different basis patterns (0.16\nand 0.84 of each, respectively).\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence Research Letter\nMRS COMMUNICATIONS  VOLUME 9  ISSUE 2  www.mrs.org/mrc ▪ 603\nhttps://doi.org/10.1557/mrc.2019.50 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTriangulation. The Connectivity constraint states that the sam-\nple locationsn for which∑\nm\nHm\nn,k is larger than zero must form a\nconnected component in graphG, and that phaseﬁelds consist-\ning of a unique combination of phases must similarly form a con-\nnected component. The Phase and Phase Field Connectivity bot\nrectiﬁes the connectivity constraints in a lazy and iterative\nmanner. See also Supplementary Information.\nPhase Matching and Phase\nDimensionality Analysis bots\nThe Phase Matching bot matches the basis patterns produced\nby the IAFD module, as part of each solution, to known crystal\nstructure patterns from the ICDD. Fitting an ICDD-derived pat-\ntern to each basis pattern (see Supplementary Information for\ndetails) provides the additional opportunity to threshold the\nloss such that if no ICDD-derived pattern sufﬁciently matches\nthe basis pattern, then the basis pattern may be describing a new\nphase. The matching of a single ICDD entry to multiple basis\npatterns in a single solution is an indication that theK (number\nof phases) of the solution is too large and thus the solution is\ninvalid. Based on this concept, the CRYSTAL planner\nmonitors Phase Dimensionality Analysis results to determine\nthe maximum number of phases to consider for the given sys-\ntem. The CRYSTAL planner runs IAFD conﬁgurations with an\nincreasing number of phases until the resulting phase diagrams\nhave an ICDD entry assigned to more than one basis pattern or\nthe valid solution rate becomes vanishingly small, providing\nautomatic determination of the upper bound on the number of\nphases (basis patterns).\nPhase Diagram Clustering and Analysis\n& Reporting bots\nThe IAFD bot produces physically meaningful phase diagrams,\nwhose phases are labeled using the ICDD, for the known\nphases. CRYSTAL runs the IAFD module in parallel (in this\npaper we report 500 runs for a given number of phases but in\ngeneral 100 or fewer runs is sufﬁcient) to produce candidate\nphase diagrams that require automated phase diagram analysis\nand consolidation. The Clustering bot takes as input the set of\nsolutions produced by parallel runs of the IAFD module and\noutputs a small set of representative candidate solutions. This\nbot uses hierarchical agglomerative clustering based on\nFigure 4. CRYSTAL’s solution to the Pd-Rh-Ta catalyst system. (a) CRYSTAL automatically generates 2500 phase diagrams in parallel from which thePhase\nDimension Analysisbot identiﬁes 1639 valid solutions and theClustering bot identiﬁes 100 representative solutions for additional reﬁnement.

The phaseﬁeld for a given sample is deﬁned\nas the set of basis patterns activated for that sample, which is\nlabeled according to the ICDD phase matching results, and\nthe comparison of the resulting pair of ICDD phase sets is per-\nformed under consideration that multiple ICDD patterns may\nmatch a given basis pattern within a predeﬁned tolerance.\nHierarchical clustering of phase diagram solutions provides\n(i) 100 representative solutions from the initial runs of IAFD\nand (ii) a portfolio of unique phase diagrams from the 100\nreﬁned solutions where the number of clusters is determined\nthrough automated thresholding based on unique sets of\nICDD patterns. The set of representative candidate solutions\nidentiﬁed by the clustering bot are provided to either the\nCRYSTAL Planner for solution reﬁnement by the IAFD mod-\nule, as initial solutions, or to theAnalysis & Reportingbot to\ngenerate phase diagrams and other visualizations for\nhuman-expert inspection.\nPd-Rh-Ta experiments\nThe Pd-Rh-Ta system was chosen for investigation based on\nthe use of Pd in catalysts for alcohol oxidation in alkaline elec-\ntrolytes\n[22] and recent success improving the methanol oxida-\ntion reactivity of Pt by combining it with Ta, where surface\nsub-oxides of Ta appeared to lower the adsorption of CO and\nthus mitigate catalyst poisoning.\n[23] The 197 XRD and XRF\nmeasurements were acquired on four co-sputtered thin ﬁlm\ncomposition libraries: the Pd-Rh-Ta ternary library and one\nfor each binary system (the edges of the composition triangle).\nThe XRF measurements provide the mapping from the physical\nlocation on the substrate to the Pd-Rh-Ta ternary composition\nspace, with measurement details and data processing as\ndescribed in Ref.24.\nThe catalytic activity of each of the four composition spread\nthin ﬁlms was mapped using the high-throughputﬂuorescence-\nbased screening, and the results for the Pd-Rh-Ta ﬁlm are\nshown in Fig. 1(b) with false-color images of ﬂuorescence\nintensity showing background-subtracted images from a\ncharge-coupled device camera, as previously described.\n[23,25]\nThe N2-sparged aqueous electrolyte contained 3 mM quinine\n(ﬂuorescent indicator) and 0.1 M potassium triﬂate (supporting\nelectrolyte). An initial voltage sweep in this electrolyte without\nmethanol was used to identify any regions exhibitingﬂuores-\ncence, which could be due toﬁlm oxidation or oxidative corro-\nsion, prompting our labeling of these composition regions as\n“unstable.” A solution with the addition of 5 M methanol\nwas then used for screening catalysis of the methanol oxidation\nreaction. As standard practice, the experiment was repeated\nthree times with fresh electrolyte and similar results were\nobtained, Figs. 1(b) and 4(g) showing the results from the\nﬁrst of these voltage sweeps. In all of these experiments, the\nvoltage sweep was performed from 0.4 to +0.5 V versus Ag/\nAgCl at a scan rate of 0.05 V/s. By setting aﬂuorescence inten-\nsity threshold, the onset potential associated with each pixel in\nthe library image was determined and the XRF-based composi-\ntion map was used to map the onset potential data to composi-\ntion space, as shown inFig. 4(g).\nPhase mapping for catalyst discovery\nin the Pd-Rh-Ta system\nThe Pd-Rh-Ta system poses substantial phase mapping chal-\nlenges due to strongly overlapped features in its phases’ XRD\npatterns as well as substantial alloying-based peak shifting,\nwhich are compounded by experimental noise in the thin-ﬁlm\nXRD measurements. CRYSTAL generated a total of 2500\nphase maps (500 phase maps per conﬁguration with a number\nof phasesK = 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). As shown inTable I, 100% of\nthe composition points, phases, and phaseﬁelds meet the phys-\nical constraints imposed by the algorithmic bots. For compari-\nson, an analogous 2500 runs were performed using AgileFD\nand NMF, withTable Irevealing some constraint satisfaction,\nbut not sufﬁcient to produce any physically meaningful solu-\ntions. Comparison was also made with NMF\nK, a recently\nreported algorithm that involves clustering of NMF compo-\nnents to identify basis patterns,\n[26] which produced a single\nK = 5 solution for which the constraint satisfaction rates exceed\nthat of NMF and AgileFD but still do not provide a physically\nmeaningful phase diagram where all constraints are satisﬁed.\nComparison of this NMF\nK solution with that of Fig. 4 is\nshown in Fig. S1, revealing a substantially different interpreta-\ntion of the data.\nCRYSTAL continued processing of its initial 2500 phase\ndiagrams via thePhase Dimension Analysisbot, which deter-\nmined that the system contains no more thanK = 6 phases\nand passed 1639 valid solutions to theClustering bot, which\nidentiﬁed 100 representative solutions using hierarchical\nagglomerative clustering based on pairwise phase diagram dis-\nsimilarity. After further reﬁning the 100 solutions using the\nIAFD bots, the hierarchicalClustering bot, using automated\nthresholding, identiﬁed 20 representative phase diagrams that\nrepresent the span of different data interpretations. These\nphase diagrams were passed to theAnalysis & Reportingbot\nto produce phase diagram visualizations and composition\nmaps of the phaseﬁelds and lattice constant shifts, which are\nreadily interpretable by an expert [Figs. 1(d)–1(f) and 4]. The\nexpert user analyzed and compared the 20 candidate phase dia-\ngrams, eliminating 15 candidate phase diagrams since they do\nnot meet subtle criteria based on prior knowledge speciﬁc to the\nPd-Rh-Ta system. In this case, this prior knowledge was from a\nprevious analysis of the Pd-Rh binary line where a single face\ncentered cubic (fcc) seven-phase diagram was analyzed. While\nthis prior knowledge was used to screen candidate solutions in\nthe present work, this type of knowledge can be used to initial-\nize and/or constrain IAFD, as described previously for\nAgileFD.\n[19,20] Other types of prior knowledge may also be\nincorporated, which may require the development of new algo-\nrithmic bots, another motivation for building CRYSTAL as a\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence Research Letter\nMRS COMMUNICATIONS  VOLUME 9  ISSUE 2  www.mrs.org/mrc ▪ 605\nhttps://doi.org/10.1557/mrc.2019.50 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nnetwork of bots that can be adapted for speciﬁc research tasks\nand expanded to incorporate new modes of reasoning. After\napplying thisﬁlter, the expert user selected theﬁnal phase dia-\ngram remainingﬁve phase diagrams, which we note could have\nalso been automatically selected via a voting method since the\nselected phase diagram represents the hierarchical cluster con-\ntaining 17 reﬁned solutions, more than any other remaining\ncluster [Fig. 4(c)].\nIn addition to identifying complete solubility of Pd and Rh\ninto the fcc structure, this phase diagram also indicates substan-\ntial alloying in the intermetallic phases [Figs. 4(d)–4(f)]. For\neach phase, the lattice constant variation with composition\nmatches expectations based on the metallic radii of the ele-\nments. For the three non-cubic phases, the observed <1% lattice\nexpansions are well modeled by the isometric peak shifting\nmodel. The hex-Pd\n3Ta phase exhibits the largest alloying\nextent of these phases, with up to 30 at.% of the smaller Rh\nand up to 35 at.% excess of the larger Ta leading to lattice\nexpansions <0.7%.\nCRYSTAL’s phase diagram enabled insightful interpretation\nof the catalytic activity in the Pd-Rh-Ta system.Figure 4(g)\nshows the result of a high-throughput screening of the\nPd-Rh-Ta libraries for methanol oxidation, a critical reaction\nfor direct methanol fuel cells traditionally addressed with\nPt-based catalysts.\n[27] While many of the compositions exhibit\ninactivity or instability under the reaction conditions, selected\nPd-Rh-Ta compositions exhibit an activity that is on par with\nthe best Pt-based catalysts evaluated by this high-throughput\nmethod. On the Rh-Ta binary line, the orth-Rh\n2Ta phase pro-\nvides the highest catalytic activity. The methanol oxidation\nonset potential is further lowered by 0.2 V to approximately\n0.5 V versus RHE via mixing orth-Rh\n2Ta with an alloy of\nhex-Pd3Ta at a composition Pd0.17Rh0.33Ta0.5. Such combina-\ntions of catalyst materials have recently been proposed for over-\ncoming historical barriers that limit catalyst performance for\nmulti-step reactions,[28,29] and indeed the activity of this multi-\nintermetallic catalyst is quite remarkable. The best thinﬁlm cat-\nalysts for methanol oxidation that have been identiﬁed by this\ntechnique include the Pt-Ta intermetallics with an onset poten-\ntial of 120 mV versus Ag/AgCl,\n[23] and a family of Pt-based fcc\nalloys including binary alloys with Ru, In, Sn, and Zn, which\nhave onset potentials between 0 and 40 mV versus Ag/\nTable I.Comparison of constraint satisfaction for solutions generated by different algorithms.\nK (# basis patterns) 3 4 5 6 7\nCRYSTAL Gibbs 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%\nGibbs-Alloy 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%\nPure phase connectivity 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%\nPhase field connectivity 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%\nAgileFD Gibbs 100% 74.93% 60.20% 47.46% 37.46%\nGibbs-Alloy 52.66% 32.36% 19.05% 11.71% 7.88%\nPure phase connectivity 63.67% 49.95% 16.68% 7.03% 2.31%\nPhase field connectivity 33.99% 32.29% 28.58% 34.55% 49.38%\nNMF Gibbs 100% 79.01% 64.35% 55.01% 47.24%\nGibbs-Alloy 100% 79.01% 64.35% 55.01% 47.24%\nPure phase connectivity 51.60% 29.70% 23.68% 11.17% 1.94%\nPhase field connectivity 28.73% 26.37% 24.73% 39.22% 56.42%\nNMF\nK Gibbs NA NA 87% NA NA\nGibbs-Alloy NA NA 77% NA NA\nPure phase connectivity NA NA 40% NA NA\nPhase field connectivity NA NA 50% NA NA\nFor each number of basis patterns (K), 500 random initializations were used to generate a set of solutions, which were then evaluated for compliance with four\nphysical constraints.

While AgileFD and NMF solutions satisfy constraints for\nsome of the composition points despite the lack of enforcement, none of the resulting phase diagrams meet all requirements. NMFK produced a singleK =5\nsolution, which satisfies constraints better than NMF and AgileFD but similarly does not provide physically meaningful phase diagrams where all constraints are\nsatisfied. Due to its constraint enforcement, CRYSTAL produces solutions which meet all of the physical requirements.\n606 ▪ MRS COMMUNICATIONS  VOLUME 9  ISSUE 2  www.mrs.org/mrc\nhttps://doi.org/10.1557/mrc.2019.50 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nAgCl.[30] The Pd0.17Rh0.33Ta0.5 catalyst is the only known\nPt-free catalyst with onset potential in this range. The onset\npotential of 0.5 V versus RHE is also within the range of\nonset overpotentials observed with Pd-based catalyst in alkaline\nelectrolytes,\n[22] and given the inactivity of Pd and Rh in the\nweak acidic electrolyte used in our experiments, the Ta-based\nintermetallics appear to enable the activity at lower pH, opening\na new direction for catalyst development and a pathway for the\nfurther development of Pt-free catalysts.\nThe discovery of this multiphase catalyst highlights both the\npower of high-throughput materials science and the effective-\nness of AI techniques for integrating multiple knowledge\nsources to provide meaningful solutions. By teaching\nCRYSTAL to reason about phase diagrams, we have for the\nﬁrst time automated the generation and exploration of alterna-\ntive data models, demonstrating the ability of AI systems to\naccelerate phase mapping and providing a novel data-\ninterpretation approach for materials sciences and beyond.\nSupplementary material\nThe supplementary material for this article can be found at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1557/mrc.2019.50\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by NSF awards CCF-1522054 and\nCNS-0832782 (Expeditions), CNS-1059284 (Infrastructure),\nand IIS-1344201 (INSPIRE); ARO awards W911NF-14-1-0498\nand W911NF-17-1-0187; AFOSR Multidisciplinary University\nResearch Initiatives (MURI) Program FA9550-18-1-0136,\nToyota Research Institute award; and US DOE Award No.\nDE-SC0004993.
