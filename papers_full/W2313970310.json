  "abstract": "An understanding of communication systems directly impacts all facets of life, including human and technology interactions. Models based on the Shannon and Weaver data transmission model are the most commonly used communication models at the technical level and have been used extensively in other fields of study as well. This paper is a contribution to the development of a communication model based on a foundation adequate for a broad information handling context. A new conceptual representation is applied to Shannon-Weaver–based models to supplement current understanding of some of the fundamental concepts employed in that model. Our intentions are to narrow the gap with other communication models and to promote a unified approach to study of the field.",
