    "abstract": "Although DeiT models had lower wAUCs than CNNs for chest radiograph and extremity domains, the differences may be negligible in clinical practice. DeiT-B had sample efficiency similar to that of DenseNet121 and may be less susceptible to certain types of hidden stratification.<b>Keywords:</b> Computer-aided Diagnosis, Informatics, Neural Networks, Thorax, Skeletal-Appendicular, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Feature Detection, Supervised Learning, Machine Learning, Deep Learning <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> © RSNA, 2022.",
