    "abstract": "Under the action of heat, the jet fire of oil-filled equipment in substations produces intense heat radiation and flame impact, causing serious harm to the personnel and equipment. Therefore, this paper has carried out a series of oil-filled equipment transformer oil jet fire experiments with different nozzle diameters to study the characteristics of transformer oil jet flame combustion. The experiment measured the mass loss rate, axial centerline temperature of the fire plume, and radiant heat flux and processed the flame visualization image. The results show that the combustion process of the transformer oil jet fire can be divided into three stages. The functional relationship between the flame height and mass flow and the functional relationship between the flame temperature and axial height are derived. A prediction model of the radiant heat flux of the transformer oil jet fire for the oil-filled equipment of the substation was established. The research results are of great significance for improving the fire protection design of substations and improving fire management and control capabilities.",
