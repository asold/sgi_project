  "abstract": "The problem of designing deep foundations is related to many civil engineering structures as it is becoming more common and frequent to construct buildings on soft soils. Pile foundation is a popular deep foundation type used to transfer superstructure load into subsoil and bearing layers. However, accurate prediction of piles' settlement is particularly difficult concerning complicated consolidation process and pile-soil interaction. The objective of this paper is to model a soil-pile system using FEM implemented in Abaqus software. The numerical results of pile bearing capacity and pile settlement were compared with static load test results of CFA piles carried out during construction of Łazienkowska tract flyovers in Warsaw and with engineering analytical calculations according to Eurocode 7 and Polish Standard Code.",
