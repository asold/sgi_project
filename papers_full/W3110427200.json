MWCNT nanofluids are prepared using a two‑step method with concentrations ranging from \n0.00 to 0.02 g/L. The test results reveal that 0.005 g/L concentration possesses the most optimum \nperformance based on the electrical (AC breakdown and lightning impulse) and dielectric (permittivity, \ndissipation factor and resistivity) behavior. According to the trend of AC breakdown strength and \nlightning impulse pattern, there were 212.58% and 40.01% enhancement indicated for 0.005 g/L \nconcentration compared to the disposed transformer oil. The presence of MWCNT also yielding to \nthe decrement of dissipation factor, increased on permittivity and resistivity behavior of disposed \ntransformer oil which reflected to the performance of electrical properties. Furthermore, it is found \nthat these features correlated to the structural properties as systematically verify by Raman and SAXS \nanalysis study.\nSignificant attention has been paid to the development of insulating oil in transformer, which serves as insulation \nand coolant medium in transformer. This is due to insulation that is the primary issue that impacts transformer \nefficiency and reliability. One of the initiatives is the implementation of nanotechnology in insulators with the \naim of improving their electrical and thermal behavior. Modern technology has enabled the production of \nmaterials with average particle sizes below 100 nm with superior electrical, mechanical, thermal, magnetic and \noptical properties. Expanding interest in nanomaterials as a future for science and technology constantly attract \nmany researchers, scientists and academician. One of the most commonly studied group of nanomaterials are \nnanofluid; nanometer-sized particles being dispersed and stable suspended in the base fluid such as water, oils, \nand alcohols. Nanofluids are often termed as ‘smart fluid’ due to its multifarious and significant application, for \nexample: cooling of electronics, engine cooling, chillers, solar water heating, multichannel heat exchanger and \nmany  others\n1–4. Recently, nanofluids have been found exhibit significant enhancement in term of electrical and \nthermal behavior for transformer oil. As example,  TiO2 nanofluids have been examined for breakdown strength \nby Wang et al.5, and they presented that the mechanism of nanoparticles have strong electron capture capability \nand reducing the net density of space charge in transformer oil. Similar natures were presented by Rajeswari \net al.\n6 for  SiO2 nanofluids and Chen et al. 7 for C60 nanofluids. Most studies have shown that nanofluid could \npossibly act as a good insulation medium despite its electrical performance. Nonetheless, on the basis of stud -\nies, the correct kinds of nanomaterials, the appropriate amount of concentrations, the proper methodology and \nother considerations are essential in order to provide optimal electrical  properties8.\nSeries of studies also have been conducted on dielectric properties of nanofluids, where added surface modi-\nfied nanoparticles in the transformer oil produced better dissipation factor (DF), DC resistivity and relative \n permittivity\n9. Although most of researchers claim that nanofluids could contribute to better insulating system \nand prepared to withstand over-voltages circumstances caused by lightning or switching events, however, infor-\nmation on suspension of nanomaterials with disposed and wasted transformer oil are very limited. Hence, the \nmain contribution of this study is to retreat, recycle and reused disposed transformer oil by dispersing MWCNT \nwith diameter of less than 8 nm to enhance its insulation performance as outlined by IEC standard. Among \nvarious nanostructures, MWCNT has unique properties that attracted the interest of researchers for industrial \nOPEN\n1Faculty of Engineering, National Defence University of Malaysia, 57000  Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 2Department \nof Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University Malaysia Sarawak, 94300 Kota Samarahan, Sarawak, \nMalaysia. 3Institute for Superconductivity and Electronic Materials, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, \nNSW 2522, Australia. *email: faizmd@upnm.edu.my\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:20984  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77810-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\napplication in term of thermo-physical, electrical, and mechanical  characteristics10. On the other hand, previ -\nous researchers verify that synthetization of MWCNT with new transformer oil is a promising alternative oil \nfor transformer  application11. The insulation system of MWCNT nanofluid based on disposed mineral oil at \nvaries concentration levels have been studied in this paper. The electrical breakdown voltages (BDV) under AC \nand standard lightning impulse (LI) under negative polarity were investigated based on IEC  60156\n12 and IEC \n 6089713 test method. The dielectric properties, heat flow Raman and SAXS structure behavior of nanofluid also \nhave been observed respectively.\nMethods\nNanofluids preparation and measurement. MWCNT nanofluids were prepared by synthesizing \nMWCNT and petroleum-based mineral oil (MO) that has been disposed and wasted by an industry because \nof its quality that does not meet the IEC standard requirement. The MO used in this study generally contains \nbenzene  C\n6H6, hexane  C6H14, cyclohexane  C6H12 and etc. The transformer oil has been operated for 10 years \nin 33/11.5 kV and 16/20MV A rating transformer since 15th October 2009. The purification or reconditioning \nprocess is a compulsory requirement for reusing transformer oil in transformer. This is for removing moisture \ncontents that leads to oxidation, dissolved combustible gas and physical contamination contains in the dis-\nposed transformer oil. Firstly, the oil was filtered by Nalgene Rapid-Flow disposable filter with 0.2 µm pore size \nfor three repetitive times. After filtering process, the MWCNT with 5–15 nm outer diameter sizes at various \nconcentrations (0.001 g/L, 0.005 g/L, 0.01 g/L, 0.015 g/L and 0.020 g/L) were added into the disposed oil and \nstirred using magnetic stirrer at room temperature with 520 rpm agitation for 30 min duration. Figure 1 depict \nthe Scanning electron microscope image (SEM) of MWCNT structure. The resulting mixture was subsequently \nplaced in a Q700 sonicator for 120 min with 40% rated power, 20 kHz capability and 700 W power rating. After \nsonication process, the mixture or known as MWCNT nanofluid is being heated and degassed respectively using \na vacuum drying oven at 60 °C and 10Mbar for 24  h\n14.\nThe AC BDV tests is conducted using a DTA 100C BAUR oil BDV tester along with 400 ml glass test vessel \ncontaining two semi-elliptical steel electrodes and at a distance of 2.5  ± 0.05 mm. As for lightning impulse test, \nthe rising method is implemented by injecting one impulse shot per step voltage of 10 kV to the oil samples until \nbreakdown occurs. This experiment is being operated in high voltage laboratory. Permittivity, dissipation factor \nand resistivity are key parameters for evaluate insulating oil condition in transformer application, which has \nbeen carried out ambient temperature until 120 °C to study the aforementioned properties by utilizing ADTR-\n2K PLUS equipment. Furthermore, Raman spectrometer (Renishaw In Via Raman Microscope) is an effective \ninstrument to characterize the detailed bonding structure state of oil samples with different condition. Lastly, \nSmall Angle X-ray Scattering instrument is performed to characterize the uniformity dispersion of MWCNT \nnanomaterial in disposed transformer oil.\nResults\nElectrical performance. Figure 2a depicts the box chart graph of AC BDV of oil samples at different con-\ncentrations ranging from 0.00 to 0.02 g/L. It can be seen that there is a clear upward trend and a significant \nenhancement in disposed MO after dispersed with 0.005 g/L MWCNT as much as 212.58%. Not only that, the \nstandard deviation value is extremely small, which means that the 0.005  g/L MWCNT nanofluid’s BDV are \nclustered around the mean value (83.24 kV) approximately. Previous authors have explained this circumstance, \nwhich explained that nano-sized particles capability to trap electron in the oil and provide better performance \nof  BDV\n15.The mechanism of breakdown in insulation is attributed to the process of hopping electrons in traps \nFigure 1.  SEM image of Multi-walled carbon nanotube with 5–15 nm diameter size.\n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |        (2020) 10:20984  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77810-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nand transmitting electrons in a delocalized state. Because of this repeatable trapping and de-trapping process, \nthe rapid electron will be shifted as a slower electron while moving from high electric field region to low region.\nFigure 2b shows the results of negative LI breakdown measurements of oil samples, where it can be noticed \nthat the average BDV of 0.005 g/L MWCNT nanofluid shows a significant increment after being sonicated with \nMWCNT nano-filler as much as 40.01% compared to based oil. This may be due to formation of a significant \namount of space charges during the ionization  process\n7. Accumulation of space in oil samples is regarded to be \none of the major elements that could have a negative impact on the electrical field and influence the efficacy of \nthe breakdown system. In the meantime, as the produced electrons have a higher motion speed, lighter mass, \nand are capable of travelling through the molecules opposed to positive charges, the electrons eventually began \nto sweep away from the ionization region. The rapid electrons allow the electric field wave to propagate across \nthe insulation layer, which contributes to a breakdown event. In the meantime, MWCNT consist of high electron \nadsorption ability known as electro-negativity, which assists in a decrement of number of electrons involved in \nthe development of electron avalanche under electric field. This occurrence disrupts the streamer formation and \nimproves the LI behavior respectively.\nDielectric properties. The studies of dielectric properties that will be discussed in this paper are dielectric \npermittivity, dielectric dissipation factor (loss angle) and DC resistivity as shown in Fig.  3. The dielectric per -\nmittivity is directly proportional to the polarization intensity of dielectric medium, where higher permittivity \nvalue gain in transformer oil produce better uniformity of the electric field in insulation medium. Hence, it is \npreferable to have a large value of permittivity for a good insulator. Referring to the temperature progression of \nthe permittivity as shown in Fig. 3a, alloil samples are found to have a slight decrease in temperature except for \ndisposed transformer oil without any filler. This occurrence was due to particles reduction, which resulted to a \ndecrement in permittivity. Besides that, the polar molecules heat movements are aggravated when temperature \nincreased, which hindered the orientation of the dipoles in electric field. Focusing on 25 °C temperature, the \npermittivity value for 0.005 g/L concentration obtain the highest value, while at 90 °C, 0.005 g/L, 0.01 g/L and \n0.015 g/L concentrations obtain consistent permittivity value which is around 1.5. Nevertheless, the results of \npermittivity value for all concentrations were higher than disposed transformer oil.\nFigure  3b depicts the dielectric dissipation factor (DF) for six concentrations of MWCNT nanofluids at \nvarious temperature. DF denotes the dielectric losses in insulating medium, which indicates total amount of \ncontaminations in transformer oil. Nanofluids samples are observed to gain lower DF value with respect to \nascending temperature compared with disposed MO. It is also found that disposed MO has a steeper slope \ncompared to others, indicating the deterioration of insulation, contamination and degradation. As for MWCNT \nnanofluids, the DF is continuously below 0.02 from 25 to 120 °C temperature. It is ideal to provide DF as minimal \nas possible due to a low resistive current, which suggesting high resistive in insulation. Focusing on DF value \nat overload condition, it is observed that 0.005 g/L concentration obtain the lowest DF value while oil without \nMWCNT obtains the highest DF value. In general, DF is the ratio of energy loss to total energy transmitted \nthrough insulation medium. Based on IEC  60422\n16, if the DF value exceeds 0.04, catastrophic failure is reported.\nFigure 3c demonstrated the comparison of resistivity for oil samples at ascending temperature. Resistiv-\nity is a fundamental property for quantifying how strongly insulation resists or conduct electric current. It is \ndesirable to have resistivity of oil as high as possible. It is observed that the resistivity of the oil samples declines \nexponentially with rising temperature. Furthermore, nanofluid at 0.005 g/L achieves the highest resistivity along \nthe temperature followed by 0.01 g/L and 0.015 g/L concentrations. Referring to 90 °C temperature (overload \ncondition), 0.005 g/L MWCNT nanofluid also has the highest resistivity value reflecting the performance of \nBDV and LI breakdown voltage. High resistivity performance represents the low formation of free ions and \nab\nFigure 2.

The level of ageing and the degree of contamination of the insulating oil also can be \nassessed by referring to resistivity.\nRaman structural properties. Raman spectroscopy probes the chemical structure of material and pro-\nvides information regarding chemical bonding identity, contamination and impurity. Figure  4 illustrated the \nRaman spectra of oil samples at various concentrations of MWCNT nanofluids from 1000 to 3100 cm −1 wave-\nlength. It can be observed that there were a few low-frequency peaks existed below 1300 cm−1 region represent-\ning carbon–carbon C–C vibrations. The set of peaks at 1300 cm −1 and 1350 cm−1 corresponds to paraffin C–H \ntwisting modes, while the large peak around 1440 cm−1 corresponds to  CH3–CH2 bending mode. Furthermore, \nit is also observed that there is a peak existed around 1600 cm−1 which due to an aromatic C=C stretching mode. \nFocusing on higher wavelength, appear that two obvious peaks at 2860 cm−1 and 2920 cm−1 which attributed of \ncarbon–hydrogen (C–H) stretching vibration which represent to diversity of CH,  CH2 and  CH3  group17–19. The \ncarbon in the former is part of aliphatic CH symmetric stretching, whereas the carbon in the latter form part of \naliphatic CH asymmetric stretching. In symmetric stretching, two or more bonds vibrate in and out together. In \nasymmetric stretching, some bonds are getting shorter at the same time as others are getting longer. It also can \nbe observed that the C–H structure has higher frequency compared to C–C bonding structure. This is due to \nhydrogen which is much lighter compared to carbon  atom\n20. However, based on overall observation of Raman \nshift, there was no additional peak existed in disposed transformer oil chemical structure after adding MWCNT \nwhich means that MWCNT molecules did not disrupt the structure behavior of transformer oil.\nRaman spectra of the oil samples were mainly characterized by first-order region (1400–1600 cm −1) and \nsecond-order region (2800–3000 cm−1). Within the first-order region, the disordered band originating in struc-\ntural defects exists at around 1350 cm −1, which are referred as D-band, while most prominent band exists at \naround 1450 cm−1 known as the G-band (graphite). D-band arises because of the presence of defects or disorder; \nthus indicating a higher degree of disorder in this sample. The D and G peak positions were determined by a \nLorentzian fit after baseline subtraction as shown in Fig. 5. It can be observed that, after dispersion of MWCNT \nin transformer oil, the low intensity peak existed around 1440 cm\n−1 shifting to a lower wavenumber. In Raman \nFigure 3.

The \nshortening or lengthening the bond length is a result of changing inter-particle interactions.\nFigure 6 depicts the calculation of intensity ratio of D-peak to G-peak  (ID/IG), full width at half maximum \n(FWHM) and area under curves of D-peak at various concentrations of MWCNT nanofluids. Using the peak \nintensity of  ID/IG ratio, one can use characterized the level of disorder in structure. Based on Fig.  6,  ID/IG ratio \nof disposed transformer oil is 0.1262 which further validates the presence of high disordered in the samples \ncompared to 0.005 g/L MWCNT nanofluid with  I\nD/IG ratio of 0.09343. Besides that, higher intensity of D-peak \nvalue confirms the existence of oxygen functional groups in the oil  samples21. Other than observing the intensity \ndata with respect to its wavenumber, the FWHM of D-peak is also calculated in this paper. FWHM is the width \nFigure 4.

The large FWHM of \nD-peak also indicates the severely reduced crystallinity and seems that the sonication process of MWCNT in \ndisposed transformer oil brings no damage to the structure of C–H  bonding\n22.\nSmall angle X‑ray scattering. To better understand the structural effects of MWCNT on disposed MO, \nthe crystallographic knowledge on solution structure with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in room temper-\nature condition is tested to characterize disassembly aggregates in samples. MWCNTs are ideal structural rein-\nforcements for MO nanofluid due to their extraordinary mechanical properties such as flexibility, stiffness and \nextremely high Y oung’s  modulus\n23. Essential steps need to been concern in involve dispersion of the MWCNT \nwithin the MO and processing of the nanofluid in order to transfer the outstanding properties of MWCNT \nin nanoscale to microscale of MO. Figure  7 shows the SAXS scattered intensity for an oil samples made of \nMWCNTs and MO. It seems that all weight concentrations of MWCNT nanofluids show perfect matches with \nthe disposed MO without any filler SAXS scattering. This behavior is agree well with others group which their \nclaim CNT dispersed in liquids using small angle neutrons and X-rays scattering  study\n24–26. The scattering pat-\nterns exhibit a strong maximum around Q = 0.07 nm−1 related to the long spacing of the MO chemical structure \nmatrix.\nMoreover, the SAXS data also provides several indicators such as to presence the chemical structure flexibility. \nFor example, the Kratky plot as shown in Fig. 8;  Q2(I(Q) as a function of Q is employed to quantitatively identify \nthe folding states of samples. The scattering intensity will exhibit a “bell-shape” peak at low Q intensity region \nfor the case of well-folded state. For this study, it is observed that all the oil samples show a rise in the curve \nwhere they are as unfolded states. This is due to the presence of electrostatic potential between particles, which \nis typically the result of Van der Waal forces in  oil\n27. MWCNT consists of cylindrical shape which supposed to \nFigure 6.  Intensity ratio of D-peak to G-peak and FWHM of oil samples.\nFigure 7.

However, \nbased on the Kratky plot, observed that introducing MWCNT in disposed MO molecules did not promote such \naggregation. Perhaps, the MWCNT structure could bind to the particles of MO to form homogeneously dispersed \nnanofluids without requiring extra surface modification.\nConclusion\nLaboratory experiments on electrical and dielectric properties of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) based \ndisposed transformer oil at various concentrations (0.0 g/L to 0.02 g/L) were carried out in this paper. It was \nfigure out that the suspension of 0.005 g/L MWCNT with disposed transformer oil manifested an enhancement \nof 212.58% in the AC breakdown performance followed by 168.87% enhancement for 0.01 g/L concentration \ncompared to transformer oil without any nano-filler. As for negative lightning impulse performance, there was \nmore than 12.29% improvement after adding some MWCNT nano-filler. Besides that, the dielectric permit-\ntivity, dissipation factor and resistivity also produced promising results that reflected the behavior of electrical \nperformance. It can be concluded that the electrical and dielectric properties obtain the highest performance at \na concentration of 0.005 g/L. This is due to the fact that at 0.005 g/L, the nanofluid tends to have better ability to \nmanage thermal properties of oil and translate into greater convection heat transfer compared to other weight \nconcentrations. For each nanofluid, there will be optimum value of weight concentration that will particularly \naffect the motion of particles in oil. In this paper, composition of material also has been recognized by utilizing \nRaman spectroscopy analysis and Small Angle X-ray Scattering in detailed. It was figure out that MWCNT nano-\nfiller does not disrupt the chemical structure of disposed transformer oil at 0.001 g/L to 0.2 g/L concentration. \nInformation provided from each testing and results considered together may form the development of new \nalternative transformer oil.\nData availability\nThe data that supports the findings of this study are available within the article.\nReceived: 2 July 2020; Accepted: 17 November 2020\nReferences\n 1.
