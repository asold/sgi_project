Developing the agent as an experimental device\ncreates several hurdles. Training and fine-tuning a model requires\nan eco-friendly corpus of training data to acquire accurate domain\nknowledge and reduce the rate of producing faulty or harmful mes-\nsages. This training must include data representing individuals with\ndiverse backgrounds as climate-related persuasions require know-\ning a person’s values to avoid backlash [25]. In addition, multiple\nstages of the user-centered design process are inherently iterative\nand require rounds of user participation [ 52], which challenges\nrapid ideation and prototyping. Ultimately, a considerable amount\nof resources (e.g., training data, computing power, labor) is needed\n∗ Author is currently at UC Davis.\nFigure 1: An overview of our proposed experiment lifecycle\ncompared to traditional Wizard of Oz experiments. We ask\nGPT-4 empowered agents to play the role of “Wizards” in\nconversation-based Wizard of Oz experiments. The agents\ntalk to either Simulacrums powered by GPT-4 (in Study 1) or\nHuman Participants (in Study 2).\nbefore the chat agent is polished for early user testing. Thus, gaug-\ning target users’ attitudes and interactions with the agent before\nputting in much development effort is usually desired.\nThe Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method [21, 32, 35] and its Oz of Wiz-\nard variant [59] could be helpful for this purpose. Both methods\nare designed to overcome experimentation obstacles by simulating\nautomatic systems or humans when testing ideas with them is ex-\npensive or infeasible. In our persuasive chatbot example, we can\nset up a WoZ experiment where a human Wizard (experimenter)\nrole-plays the to-be-developed technology and talks to participants.\nThe experiment can elicit data revealing users’ behaviors and at-\ntitudes when interacting with an envisioned technology before\nit is implemented, reducing the cost of design and development\niterations. Yet, scaling up WoZ is challenging due to the required\nhuman labor for role-playing.\nClosely parallel with the “role-playing” in the WoZ method,\nrecent studies propose leveraging large language models (LLMs)\nto “role-play” and simulate human-to-human or human-to-agent\nchats and generate synthetic data with low cost [38, 55]. The ad-\nvancement of LLMs points to the potential of harnessing LLMs’\nspeedy generation ability to role-play Wizards and scale up WoZ\nexperiments. An overarching question that needs to be addressed\n1\narXiv:2407.08067v1  [cs.HC]  10 Jul 2024\nFang and Arechiga, et al.\nis whether we can reliably use LLMs to elicit data that can be trans-\nlated into design and development insights as a human Wizard\nwould do in traditional WoZ.\nIn this paper, we take the first step towards exploring the feasi-\nbility of applying LLMs in conversational WoZ experiments. We\npresent an experiment lifecycle (Figure 1) for safely piloting\nand integrating LLMs into WoZ experiments where GPT-4\nempowered agents, instead of humans, role-play as Wizards\nat scale. The goal of the LLM Wizards is the elicitation of users’\nreactions to an envisioned technology being simulated in WoZ\nexperiments (e.g., a specialized chatbot conducting persuasive con-\nversations for social good), which provides design and development\ninsights, rather than becoming the envisioned technology itself.\nThe lifecycle is demonstrated via two studies, where GPT-4 agents\nact as “Wizards” (named as Wizard of LLMs, or WoLs) in WoZ\nexperiments to talk to Simulacrums (also GPT-4 agents) and Par-\nticipants (humans). This WoZ process generates insights guiding\nthe development of new tools by: (1) collecting data that unveils\nhow users engage with the to-be-invented tools on a large scale,\nand (2) understanding design spaces and opportunities for improve-\nment for the envisioned tools, based on observed limitations LLM\nWizards.\nFollowing traditional experimentation models (e.g., original WoZ\nmethodology [33], many are called / refine / few are called frame-\nwork [18]), the experiment lifecycle starts with a coarse, cheap, and\nlarge-scale WoLs-to-Simulacrums setting (Stage 1). While LLMs’\nrole-playing bears promise, their role-playing ability in conversa-\ntional WoZ experiments has not been formally evaluated, making\nthe appropriateness of incorporating WoLs directly into human-\nfacing experiments questionable. The fully automated Stage 1 al-\nlows the fast generation of synthetic, scenario-specific conversa-\ntional data and allows one to observe LLMs’ behaviors in WoZ\nstudies without risking human participants by exposing them to\npotentially inappropriate messages generated by LLMs. Designing\nscalable evaluations for LLMs in WoZ chats upfront is essential for\nunderstanding the patterns and limitations of WoLs. Informed by\nobserved failure modes of LLMs acknowledged in previous studies\n(e.g., producing biased and toxic text [16, 62, 80] and noncompli-\nance with instructions [ 39, 69, 76]), we quantitatively estimated\nthe WoZ conversation quality through lenses of toxicity, sentiment,\ntext similarities, readability, and topic modeling. These measures\nare scalable and interpretable, enabling a fast scan of some critical\naspects of WoLs’ behaviors in conversational WoZ and assessing\nwhether WoLs can be safely applied in human-facing setups. After\nan intervention that fixes the detected problems, the experiment\nlifecycle advances to Stage 2, where experimenters apply WoLs in\nhuman-facing experiments to uncover more nuanced failure modes\nthat emerged from Wizards’ interactions with real users, paired\nwith a more fine-grained analysis. Combining Stage 1 and Stage\n2, the experiment lifecycle adheres to the underlying principles of\ntraditional WoZ while allowing experimenters to scale up experi-\nments with LLMs. This paper showcases how researchers can follow\nthe experiment lifecycle to pilot a conversational WoZ experiment\nthrough Study 1 and Study 2.\nIn addition to the experiment lifecycle, this paper offers two\ncontributions: (1) Propose a heuristic evaluation framework for\nLLM-generated synthetic conversational data. Show how automatic\nmetrics can detect and quantify pitfalls in the LLMs’ generation of\nconversation data at scale. Complementing with human evaluation,\nthe framework can serve as a starting point for further revealing\nLLMs’ behavioral patterns in WoZ experiments. (2) Compile a list of\nidentified failure modes of LLMs in WoZ experiments with evidence\nfrom formal quantitative and qualitative evaluations.\n2 BACKGROUND\nThe WoZ method [32] has study participants interact with an “inter-\nface” or a “system” secretly controlled by a hidden human Wizard.\nSpecifically, we ask, can an LLM be used to power a Wizard? Aim-\ning at eliciting human behaviors to understand how to build a\ndomain-specific persuasive bot, we prompt LLMs Wizards to con-\nduct persuasive conversations.\n2.1 The Wizard of Oz Method\nWoZ provides a solution for testing innovations and receiving hu-\nman feedback without a completed implementation, which could\nbe costly or infeasible with currently available technologies [6, 32,\n42, 46]. The objective of WoZ is to leverage the collected users’\nreaction data to facilitate new technology design [ 11, 64]. In an\nearly WoZ example [33], two phases are described: a simulation\nwhere the experimenter is situated in todo and an intervention\nwhere language processing is used with an experimenter. Currently,\nvariations of WoZ are seen across a plurality of domains and appli-\ncations [14, 21, 35, 43, 53, 58]. The inverse “Oz of Wizard” method\nwas introduced to study human-robot interaction. Here, human\nbehaviors are being simulated to evaluate robot behaviors [ 59].\nWe argue that both methods share the same underlying principle:\nleveraging humans’ or machines’ role-playing abilities to overcome\nexperimentation difficulties in human-machine interaction studies.\nAs LLMs augment their role-playing abilities, their capability to\nact as “Wizards” in WoZ will grow. While we do not advocate for\nreplacing humans with LLMs in all WoZ, we note that large-scale\nWoZ is sometimes desirable but costly or infeasible with human\nWizards; LLM Wizards can ease the scalability limitation existing\nin human-led WoZ. In this paper, we contribute an experiment\nlifecycle that guides researchers to estimate the risks and failures\nof LLM Wizards before incorporating them into human-facing user\nstudies.\n2.2 Chatbots as Conversational Agents\nChatbots as conversational agents are common [7, 30, 66, 70]. They\ncan facilitate online tasks by enhancing people’s engagement and\ndelivering personalization [70, 72], elicit information [23, 34, 71],\nand provide mental support to socially isolated individuals [ 30].\nStudies using natural language generation (NLG) to deliver inter-\nventions or conduct persuasive conversations can trigger attitude or\nbehavior change (e.g., persuading people to adopt healthy lifestyles\nor donate to charities) [8, 31, 47, 57, 75, 78]. These persuasive chat-\nbots should build trust and empathy with users and generate per-\nsonalized responses [8, 27]. Due to various challenges in designing\ngood chatbots in specialized domains, the WoZ method is widely\nused to pilot interactions between study participants and “chatbots”\n(role-played by human Wizards) [45, 46].\n2\nOn LLM Wizards\n2.3 Role-Playing LLMs\nLLMs are often used to simulate humans and replicate behaviors.\nThey can adapt traits to imitate specific personalities and pro-\nfiles [54] and reproduce response distributions from diverse human\nsubgroups, passing the “social science Turing Test” [3]. LLM-based\nagents organized in a virtual community generated believable social\nbehaviors [50]. Studies suggest opportunities to leverage LLMs to\ngenerate research data. There has been a surge in debates regarding\nwhether LLMs can replace human participants [9, 13, 24]. Synthetic\nresponses to open-ended questions are found to be useful in ideating\nand piloting experiments [22]. Further, role-playing frameworks al-\nlow LLM-powered agents to interact with each other autonomously,\nfacilitating scalable synthetic conversation data generation [38].\nHowever, apart from the frequently used “Turing test” (testing\nwhether LLMs-generated data are distinguishable from humans-\ngenerated data), evaluating LLMs’ generation remains challenging\ngiven their broad task domains and output styles. Recent studies\nadopt three evaluation approaches. Independent benchmarks (e.g.,\nreference-based metrics including BLEU [49] and ROUGE [40]) have\nbeen extensively studied and used for NLG systems evaluations, but\nare usually domain- or task-specific and correlate poorly with hu-\nman judgments [51]. Human evaluation is considered to be reliable\nwhen multiple evaluators’ opinions are incorporated (e.g., Elo rating\nsystem [15]), ensuring the outcomes align well with human values.\nHowever, they are costly and not scalable. Recent work showed\nLLMs’ potential in evaluating LLMs’ generations [9, 10, 41, 79] and\nGPT-4, as an evaluator, correlates well with human labelers. Yet,\nLLM-based evaluations lack explainability, and several LLMs’ biases\n(e.g., positional bias) have been observed [63]. To deploy LLMs in\nWoZ experiments and interpret generated data, identifying LLMs’\nbehaviors when they are prompted to role-play, especially when\nand how they could fail, becomes essential; currently, LLMs are\nfar from flawless. We propose a heuristic evaluation framework\ncomprised of automatic metrics widely adopted in HCI research\nfor textual data analysis and surface how it can help identify LLMs’\nbehaviors and failure modes in WoZ experiments.\n3 WIZARD OF LLM EXPERIMENTS\nSimilar to Kelley’s foundational work [32, 33], our experiment life-\ncycle has two stages, a coarse initial stage and a refinement second\nstage. However, our approach diverges as the first stage is run at a\nlarge scale with little experimenter intervention. The second stage\nhas a much smaller scale, involves human participants, and is con-\nducted after experimenter intervention guided by the outcome of\nthe first stage. Finally, similar to Kelley’s final stage, a comparison\nof the two stages describes the next steps for the experimenter\nand idea elicitation. This section demonstrates Stage 1 and Stage 2\nthrough Study 1 and Study 2 respectively.\nThrough two studies, we seek to answer: RQ1 How do LLMs\nbehave in closed-loop conversations (when both interlocutors are\nLLM-powered) in WoZ settings? How can we identify LLMs’ suc-\ncesses or failures using heuristic evaluations? RQ2 How do LLMs\nbehave differently when they, acting as Wizards, talk to humans\ninstead of LLMs? RQ3 How can we safely integrate LLMs in WoZ\nexperiments, and what limitations and distortions should be con-\nsidered when interpreting data generated in such settings?\nFigure 2: Study 1: Simulating conversational WoZ experi-\nments using the WoLs and the Simulacrums.\n3.1 Study 1: When WoLs meet Simulacrums\nWe joined WoLs with Simulacrums in a conversational WoZ ex-\nperiment. Before testing with people, we aim to (1) identify LLMs’\nbehaviors and verify whether their “failures” are dangerous to hu-\nman participants and (2) collect a wide sample of agent-to-agent\nconversations to observe a broad range of failure modes.\n3.1.1 Method. The WoLs and the Simulacrums were GPT-4 agents1,\nand their behaviors were steered by system prompts (see Figure 2).\nThe prompts instruct them to align their behaviors with normal\nconversation structures with strangers (e.g., start with an introduc-\ntion, send succinct messages, etc.). Gender-neutral names, Jamie\nand Leslie, were assigned to the WoLs and the Simulacrums respec-\ntively for chatting purposes.\nSeveral factors could affect message generation and conversation\ndynamics, including interlocutors’ identity disclosure and demo-\ngraphic backgrounds [57, 62], the amount of detailed context and\ngranularity of instruction to LLMs [5, 65], and temperature param-\neter setting [48]. Accordingly, we note five independent variables:\n• Bot identity disclosure . A boolean value determines whether the\nWoL self-discloses as a bot. A persuasive chatbot study showed\nthat disclosure affects persuasion outcome [57].\n• Demographic information . The WoL and the Simulacrum were\nassigned information including age, income, education, political\naffiliation, gender, and ethnicity. The distribution followed 2020\nUS Census data2 except gender, which was sampled based on a\nreleased dataset [36] to include non-binary identities. The demo-\ngraphic information could help the WoL and the Simulacrum pick\ntheir standpoints when chatting and assist the WoL in adjusting\nits persuasion strategy. Conversely, the demographic background\nopens up space for biases to arise.\n• Demographic information disclosure . The WoL and the Simu-\nlacrum were assigned a boolean each to state whether their de-\nmographic information should be part of their self-introduction.\n• Instruction granularity . This feature guides the conversation.\nWe defined three levels of instruction granularity, instructing\nthe WoL on what to chat about: Level 1 random chat, Level\n2 chat around a topic, Level 3 chat around a topic and towards\na goal. All Level 2 and Level 3 conversations followed one of\nthe three topics: adoption of electric vehicles (EV), adoption\n1https://openai.com/research/gpt-4. Accessed September 2023.\n2https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/2020-\ncensus-results.html. Accessed September 2023.\n3\nFang and Arechiga, et al.\nof green household electrification, and donating to a charity,\nwhile the conversation goals (Level 3 only) are to persuade the\ninterlocutors to adopt/donate. The embedded topic promptand\ngoal promptfollow the instruction granularity. For example,\nwhen instruction granularity is set to Level 1, the topic prompt\nfed to the WoL is “You will initiate a random chat with your\ninterlocutor” while the goal promptis left empty.\n• Temperature. This GPT-4 variable controls how diverse the WoL’s\ngenerated outputs are, with three levels: 1 (GPT-4’s default tem-\nperature), 0.5 (more stable), and 1.5 (more diverse outputs). The\ntemperature of the Simulacrum stayed at the default value.\nWe generated 131 WoLs and Simulacrums conversations; each\nconversation includes 12 turns (i.e., 25 messages in total, with 13\nWoL messages (including an initialization) and 12 Simulacrum mes-\nsages). For each conversation, a new pair of WoL and Simulacrum\nwas initialized with random values for all five factors.3.\nClosed-loop chatting between LLMs is an under-explored sce-\nnario. Can the WoLs lead meaningful conversations? Will the Sim-\nulacrums follow? Will the conversations converge at some point\n(or will the toxicity or bias be amplified during conversations)? We\nanalyze these LLMs-generated dialogues to answer RQ1.\n3.1.2 Analysis and Result. We found that the WoLs can usually\ninitiate conversations and properly engage with the Simulacrums\nin the early stage. However, sometimes, conversations later go\noff-track. See Appendix B for an example.\nHow can we analyze the large amount of conversational data\nsystematically? In-depth investigation of batches of conversational\ndata is costly, and human evaluation at a large scale is usually im-\npractical. Informed by observed failure modes of LLMs (generating\nbiased and harmful content [16, 62, 80], repetitive messages [26, 38],\nincoherent or nonsensical text [ 29, 68], and limited instruction-\nfollowing ability [39, 69, 76]), we introduce a heuristic evaluation\nframework that quantitatively estimated the conversation quality\nthrough lenses of toxicity, sentiment, text similarities, readability,\nand topic modeling. These measures fulfill the criteria for an initial\nassessment of LLM-based WoZ chats by being (1) scalable, compu-\ntationally inexpensive, and applicable to large datasets, (2) broadly\ncapturing limitations of LLMs’ generations recognized in NLP lit-\nerature, and (3) interpretable by the experimenters so the LLM\nWizards can be refined before being deployed in real-world human–\nfacing WoZ experiments. While these metrics are not exhaustive\nand cannot discover all LLMs’ failure modes (which is inherent\nin all heuristic methods), they enable a fast scan of some critical\naspects of WoLs’ behaviors in conversational WoZ and an assess-\nment of whether WoLs have the potential to be safely applied in\nhuman-facing setups. The framework is summarized in a table in\nAppendix C. We describe the rationales of each of the metrics as\nfollows. Examples of generated messages and their corresponding\nquantitative scores are provided in Appendix E.\nToxicity. Toxicity is the most important consideration when we\ngauge the potential of applying LLMs in real-world human-facing\nWoZ experiments. Our Simulacrums had profiles with diverse com-\nbinations of demographics, which made a good estimation of how\n3The supplemental material details how system prompts incorporated the independent\nvariables: https://osf.io/akyf2/?view_only=a12a3a3d0c6d4be3884ca3f82aaad5ab.\ntoxic WoLs were (especially when they face Simulacrums with\ndemographics representing minorities) possible.\nWe measured message toxicity using the toxicity score from\nPerspective API 4 , which has been widely used for NLG evalu-\nation [20, 44]. Each API call returns a score ranging from 0 to 1,\nrepresenting the possibility of the input message being toxic. Fol-\nlowing previous studies, we considered messages with a toxicity\nscore of >= 0.5 to be toxic. WoLs generated non-toxic messages\nregardless of their interlocutors’ demographics. All WoLs’ mes-\nsages had low toxicity scores ( 𝑀 = 0.02, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.03). Similarly,\nSimulacrums’ messages were also unlikely to be toxic (𝑀 = 0.02,\n𝑆𝐷 = 0.03).\nSentiment analysis. Sentiment is a measure for signaling bias\nin LLM-generated text [12, 56]. Following previous works, we ap-\nplied VADER [28], a computationally efficient rule-based model , as\nthe sentiment analyzer for conversation messages. The output com-\npound score ranges from -1 (extremely negative) to 1 (extremely\npositive). Analyses showed some LLMs exhibit bias by generating\ntexts with more negative sentiments when provided with contexts\nlinked to specific groups [12, 56].\nThe sentiments of WoLs’ messages were consistently positive\n(𝑀 = 0.73, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.29), and so were the sentiments of Simulacrums’\nmessages (𝑀 = 0.71, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.28). We found no statistically sig-\nnificant difference in messages’ sentiments regarding any of the\nindependent variables (i.e., whether a Simulacrum disclosed its\ndemographics, whether a conversation was a random chat or a per-\nsuasive dialogue, etc.). Notably, the sentiments of WoLs’ messages\ndid not differ based on the demographics of the Simulacrums they\nwere talking to, no matter whether the Simulacrums self-disclosed\nthe information or not. We observed that the magnitude of demo-\ngraphic differences between interlocutors (quantified as the average\nof normalized differences along each dimension of demographic\ninformation) had no main effect on either sentiments.\nMessage similarity. LLM-generated chat messages may be\nrepetitive sometimes, especially in a closed-loop setting [ 38]. To\nquantitatively observe this problem, we adopted semantic similarity\nand sequence-based similarity to compare each message with the\ntwo previous messages in the dialogue:\n(1) Semantic similarity. Semantic similarity measures how close\ntext meanings are. We used the SentenceTransformers framework\n5 to compute text embeddings by loading a pre-trained model,\nall-MiniLM-L6-v2, then the semantic similarity of pairs of texts\nwas computed by the cosine similarity between their embeddings.\nSemantic similarity gradually increased over time, as shown in\nFigure 3. We split each conversation into three segments (segment 1:\nfrom beginning to conversation turn 4, segment 2: conversation turn\n5 to 8, segment 3: conversation turn 9 to the end). Welch’s t-tests\nshowed that semantic similarity between two adjacent messages\nsent by WoLs (separated by one message sent by the Simulacrums)\nin segment 3 (𝑀 = 0.66, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.17) was significantly higher than\nthat in segment 2 (𝑀 = 0.59, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.15) (𝑡(258)= −3.5,𝑝 < .05),\nwhich was significantly higher than that in segment 1 (𝑀 = 0.53,\n𝑆𝐷 = 0.12) (𝑡(249) = −3.2,𝑝 < .05). The increase in semantic\n4https://perspectiveapi.com/. Accessed September 2023.\n5https://www.sbert.net/. Accessed September 2023.\n4\nOn LLM Wizards\nsimilarity between WoLs’ messages and the Simulacrums’ messages\nthat they responded to, was not significant.\nFactorial ANOVA showed that WoL’s temperature had main\neffects on semantic similarity between WoL’s adjacent messages\n(𝐹(2)= 19.7,𝑝 < .05) as well as between WoL’s message and the\nprevious message it received from the Simulacrum (𝐹(2)= 61.4,𝑝 <\n.05). Instruction granularity had a main effect on semantic similar-\nity between WoL’s adjacent messages (𝐹(2)= 29.9,𝑝 < .05). Higher\ntemperature led to lower semantic similarity (between two WoL’s\nmessages, when temperature=0.5: 𝑀 = 0.64, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.14, tempera-\nture=1: 𝑀 = 0.59, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.10, temperature=1.5: 𝑀 = 0.48, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.06;\nbetween WoL’s message and Simulacrum’s message, when tem-\nperature=0.5: 𝑀 = 0.60, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.57, temperature=1: 𝑀 = 0.57,\n𝑆𝐷 = 0.12, temperature=1.5: 𝑀 = 0.33, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.08). Higher in-\nstruction granularity led to higher semantic similarity (between\ntwo WoL’s messages; when instruction granularity=1: 𝑀 = 0.52,\n𝑆𝐷 = 0.11, instruction granularity=2: 𝑀 = 0.58, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.11, instruc-\ntion granularity=3: 𝑀 = 0.68, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.11).\nWhile a high semantic similarity might imply the WoL was\nbeing repetitive, it might also be a positive signal indicating strong\nconversation cohesiveness. We further analyzed the sequence-based\nsimilarity of messages for a deeper understanding.\n(2) Sequence-based similarity. We calculated the longest common\nsubsequence (lcsseq) similarity between messages as a measure of\nsequence-based similarity using TextDistance library 6. The lcsseq\nsimilarity (Figure 4) increased as conversations proceeded. Splitting\nthe conversations into three segments, Welch’s t-tests showed that\nlcsseq similarity between WoL’s messages in segment 3 (𝑀 = 0.49,\n𝑆𝐷 = 0.15) was significantly higher than in segment 2 (𝑀 = 0.44,\n𝑆𝐷 = 0.09) (𝑡(213)= −3.61,𝑝 < .05), which was higher than that\nin segment 1 ( 𝑀 = 0.39, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.05) (𝑡(202) = −5.19,𝑝 < .05).\nSequence similarity between WoL’s messages and the previous\nmessages from Simulacrum in segment 2 ( 𝑀 = 0.49, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.08)\nwas also significantly higher than that in segment 1 ( 𝑀 = 0.38,\n𝑆𝐷 = 0.04) (𝑡(202)= −2.46,𝑝 < .05). Rising lcsseq similarity signals\nincreasingly large portions of verbatim common text. Together with\nthe heightened semantic similarities, we concluded that WoLs sent\nincreasingly repetitive messages as conversations proceeded.\nMessage readability. LLMs occasionally generate senseless\ntexts that elude grammatical checks as they may follow rules (e.g.,\nhave Subject–Verb–Object structures). The Flesch read ease score [17]\nwas used for conversational readability estimation. The score of\neach message was calculated using the Textstat library 7 , where a\nlow score indicates confusing expressions. Welch’s t-tests showed\nthat WoLs’ message readability decreased significantly over time,\nwhile Simulacrums’ message readability was relatively stable (see\nFigure 5). Specifically, WoLs’ messages readability in segment 2\n(𝑀 = 0.47, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.16) was significantly lower than that of seg-\nment 1 ( 𝑀 = 0.51, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.11) (𝑡(228) = 2.39,𝑝 < .05), while\ninsignificantly higher than segment 3 ( 𝑀 = 0.40, 𝑆𝐷 = 0.39)\n(𝑡(172)= 1.87,𝑝 = 0.06). Factorial ANOVA showed that instruc-\ntion granularity had a main effect on WoLs’ message readability\n(𝐹(2)= 6.72,𝑝 < .05. Readability when instruction granularity=1:\n6https://github.com/life4/textdistance. Accessed September 2023.\n7https://pypi.org/project/textstat/.

Conversational content and topicality play\nmajor roles in the WoL’s performance. Topic modeling makes a\nquick scan possible; our domain examines “attitude towards electric\nvehicles (EV)”. Here, we showcase examples of how topic modeling\ncan unveil nuances of conversations based on Simulacrums’ demo-\ngraphics, which serves as an estimation of whether WoLs conduct\nconversations according to their interlocutors’ identities. In this\nscenario, we only keep conversations in which the Simulacrums\nself-disclose their information. We preprocessed all messages sent\nby WoLs in these conversations (i.e., removed punctuations, stop\nwords, tokenized), then trained Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\nmodels using corpora and dictionaries converted from tokenized\ntexts as inputs for each demographic group.\nComparing results from different demographic groups, “electric”\n“vehicle” were the leading terms for all topics, implying the WoLs\ndid well in staying on topic. Next, we examine the overall term\nfrequencies across identified topics. Figures 6a, 6b, 6c, and 6d show\nthe top 15 terms in conversations between WoLs and Simulacrums\nassigned as Women, Men, Democrats, and Republicans respectively.\nWhile it is hard to claim that the conversations differ significantly\nbased on the Simulacrums’ demographics, we found cues implying\nthat the WoLs adapted their wording based on the Simulacrums’\ndisclosed identity. For example, comparing the lists in Figures 6c\nand 6d, WoLs tend to mention more words like “transition” and\n“sustainable” to Democrats Simulacrums than to Republican Simu-\nlacrums. Personalization based on interlocutors’ demographics and\nvalues could be a good strategy for persuasive conversations [25].\nYet, this strategy may open doors for potential bias [77].\nIn summary, we applied a heuristic evaluation framework com-\nprised of computational metrics to surface WoLs’ behaviors in sim-\nulated conversational-WoZ experiments. It revealed pitfalls in LLM-\ngenerated conversations that may have not been quantitatively\nmeasured before. While the quantitative and heuristic natures of\nthe framework made the analysis relatively coarse-grained, they\nallow fast and large-scale surfacing of WoLs’ behaviors and provide\na foundation for further exploration. WoLs to Simulacrums chats\nprovide opportunities to estimate how bad the failures are without\nrisking human participants. While the WoLs made some mistakes\n(e.g., sending confusing messages), they did well in being non-toxic\nand non-discriminative. This suggests that it is safe to proceed to\nthe next stage of the lifecycle—testing WoLs with real Participants.\n3.2 Study 2: When WoLs meet Participants\nNext, an LLM-to-human exploration is necessary to model the\nLLMs-supported WoZ (addressing RQ2) in a more realistic setting.\n3.2.1 Fix. Our experiment lifecycle advised experimenters to “fix”\nWoLs before advancing to Stage 2. Here, we streamlined the fixing\nprocess as technical methods of refining WoLs (e.g., prompt engi-\nneering, finetuning, retrieval-augmented generation) could vary\ncase-by-case and are not the focus of this paper.

This paper\naims at walking through the lifecycle, offering reference values for\nfuture experiments. We advise experimenters to investigate ways\nof addressing identified problems in their specific context. In our\nEV adoption chatting scenario, WoLs are safe for humans in critical\ndimensions (non-toxic, non-biased) while having unstable perfor-\nmance in other aspects. We simplified the fix phase as picking the\nsettings of WoLs to maximize these aspects of conversation quality\n(e.g., readability and non-repetitiveness) based on Study 1 result.\nStage 2 involves human participants and hence conducts fewer\nconversations than the previous stage. The smaller-scale collected\ndata is suitable for a more discreet qualitative evaluation that aims\nto uncover latent failure modes that went undetected in the coarse-\ngrained quantitative analysis after Stage 1.\n3.2.2 Method. We recruited 56 study participants from Prolific8 to\nchat with WoLs using Study 1’s prompt template and selected set-\ntings that resulted in high conversation quality: Wizards hid their\nbot and demographic identities, chatted about EVs and persuaded\nadoption, and used temperature 1. Participants are U.S. residents,\nabove 18 years old, have a driving license, and do not own/lease\n8https://www.prolific.co/ Accessed September 2023.\nan EV. Participants were told they would talk to “Jamie”. The con-\nversation needed 12 turns before the conclusion, followed by a\nsurvey regarding perceived rapport [67], chat partner impression\nand conversation quality [57], perceived bot identity, open-ended\nfeedback, and demographics. The study takes roughly 20 minutes.\n3.2.3 Analysis and Result.\nConversations between WoLs and Participants. Like in Study 1,\nWoLs’ messages were non-toxic (toxicity:𝑀 = 0.01,𝑆𝐷 = 0.02). The\nsentiments of WoLs’ messages stayed positive (𝑀 = 0.58,𝑆𝐷 = 0.13)\nand were significantly more positive than those of Participants’\nmessages (𝑀 = 0.26,𝑆𝐷 = 0.17) (𝑡(102) = 11.05,𝑝 < .05), as\nshown in Figure 7. Factorial ANOVA showed no evidence that WoLs’\nsentiments differed based on the Participants’ demographics. WoLs’\nsentiment had no effects on Participants’ perceived rapport, chat\npartner impression, conversation quality, and persuasion outcome.\nThus WoLs are likely to be unharmful when talking to humans.\nBoth semantic and sequence-based similarities between mes-\nsages were relatively stable as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, except\nthat the semantic similarity between WoLs’ messages and Partici-\npants’ previous messages in segment 2 (𝑀 = 0.36,𝑆𝐷 = 0.14) was\nsignificantly higher than that in segment 1 (𝑀 = 0.45,𝑆𝐷 = 0.12).\nThe readability of the messages stayed consistent (see Figure 10).\nTopic modeling results again showed that WoLs stayed on the topic.\n6\nOn LLM Wizards\nDifferent from Study 1, it seems that the frequently mentioned\nterm lists were very similar across different demographic groups\n(in Figures 11a, 11b, 11c, and 11d).\nParticipants were generally positive about their interactions with\nWoLs. On a scale of 5, WoLs were rated highly regarding perceived\nrapport (𝑀 = 4.40,𝑆𝐷 = 0.80), chat partner impression ( 𝑀 =\n4.46,𝑆𝐷 = 0.62), and conversation quality (𝑀 = 4.42,𝑆𝐷 = 0.66).\nMany participants recognized the WoLs were bots due to Jamie’s\nfaster-than-human typing speed; the content and overall flow of\nWoLs’ messages were perceived to be natural and human-like.\n3.3 Comparing Study 1 and Study 2\nNext, one must compare the two WoZ studies [33]: how did WoLs-\nto-Simulacrums differ from WoLs-to-Partcipants? As we relied on\ndata generated from the synthetic LLMs-to-LLMs setting in Stage\n1 to make key decisions of whether and how we can proceed to\nhuman-facing WoZ experiments, it is essential to understand how\ndistorted the Stage 1 data is. A comparison between Study 1 and\nStudy 2 can inform us what distortions should be considered and\nhow experimenters should calibrate their expectations when in-\nterpreting data generated in the WoLs-to-Simulacrums setting. To\ninvestigate, we sampled 25 conversations with the same setups\nfrom Study 1 and from Study 2. The conversations were compared\nquantitatively along the dimensions of the proposed evaluation\nmetrics, then analyzed by two HCI experts to gauge the overall\nchat quality, the WoLs’ instruction following, and what mistakes\nWoLs made when role-playing Wizards. The qualitative analysis is\nused to capture a broader range of Wizards’ failure modes that the\nquantitative metrics failed to identify.\n3.3.1 Quantitative result. There was no significant difference in\ntoxicity and sentiment of WoLs’ messages. However, WoLs-to-\nParticipants messages were less repetitive as the semantic simi-\nlarity between adjacent messages in Study 2 (𝑀 = 0.48,𝑆𝐷 = 0.07)\nwas significantly lower than in Study 1 ( 𝑀 = 0.57,𝑆𝐷 = 0.07)\n(𝑡(48)= 4.67,𝑝 < 0.05). No significant difference in WoLs’ message\nreadability was observed between the two studies.\n3.3.2 Human evaluation. We asked two experts familiar with WoZ\nmethods to read the 50 conversations and identify how WoLs failed\nto role-play well. Apart from the repetition issue (i.e., WoLs being\nmore repetitive in the closed-loop setting of Study 1) which was\nalready recognized by quantitative metrics, two themes evident in\nconversations from Study 2 emerged:\nWoLs were too salesman-like. When Participants clearly expressed\nreluctance towards buying an EV, WoLs were being “politely pushy”\nwithout compromise. WoLs did not understand that the conversa-\ntion goals might take indirect paths (e.g., persuading to lease EVs\nor choose EVs for ride-sharing services). This is a sign that WoLs\ndid not acquire outstanding persuasion strategies.\nWoLs made assumptions of their interlocutors and lacked empathy.\nWoLs sometimes make false assumptions about the Participants.\nFor example, WoLs sometimes assumed that Participants could\ncharge EVs overnight from home and wake up with a charged car.\nSimilarly, WoLs assumed that Participants did not have financial\ndifficulties; some Participants said EVs are too expensive, and the\nWoLs lacked empathy and failed to build rapport.\nRole-switching. This failure mode only appeared once in a WoL-\nto-Simulacrum closed-loop conversation where the WoL and the\nSimulacrum switched roles. The WoL assumed a study participant\nrole and discussed how they could not afford a car. It could be mea-\nsured quantitatively but went undetected in our current evaluation\nmetrics. A quantitative measure that identifies the role-switching\nphenomenon can be integrated into our evaluation framework.\n4 DISCUSSION\nRevisiting RQ3, we found LLMs can be useful tools for conversa-\ntional WoZ experiments; however, potential pitfalls exist. Following\na two-stage experiment lifecycle, LLMs showed the potential to\nbe safely applied in human-facing studies. LLMs, role-playing as\nWizards, can elicit user attitudes and behaviors when engaging\nwith an envisioned technology and probe the design space of the\ntechnology as human Wizards would do in a traditional WoZ study.\n4.1 Responsibly integration of LLMs and WoZ\nCombining Study 1 and Study 2, we propose a two-stage experiment\nlifecycle (Figure 1) for estimating the risks and potentials of LLMs-\npowered WoZ experiments.\nStage 1:Replacing humans on both sides of traditional WoZ ex-\nperiments with LLM-powered agents . Following Study 1, this stage\ncreates a simulation of conversations between Wizards and par-\nticipants without risking humans’ exposure to harmful content.\nExperimenters should inspect this stage’s data and identify failures\nbefore continuing. We proposed a heuristic evaluation framework\ncombining quantitative metrics that help experimenters understand\nthe data in a scalable and explainable manner. Experimenters should\nstrive to correct the WoLs through various techniques (e.g., finetun-\ning) before moving on to human-facing experiments if they show\nevidence of being potentially harmful.\nStage 2:Piloting conversations between Wizards role-played by\nLLMs and human participants . This stage, following Study 2, affords\na realistic pilot with access to human feedback. It is essential to no-\ntice that the Simulacrums’ behaviors may be distorted from human\nbehaviors as they lack human perceptions, and the quantitative\nmetrics cannot capture all aspects of the conversation data. This\nstage allows one to close these gaps. By comparing data generated\nin Stage 2 and Stage 1, experimenters can understand the distortions\nof LLM-to-LLM data. Stage 2 also elicits feedback from participants\nregarding their chatting experience (e.g., perceived rapport) and\nallows for an in-depth qualitative inspection. Another round of\nadjustments on the WoLs should be applied if any additional failure\nmodes are found in this stage. This lifecycle establishes a study setup\ninvolving the finalized LLM Wizards that are safe for human-facing\nexperiments. These LLM Wizards can lead large-scale experiments\nwithout overburdening human experimenters with role-playing\ntasks.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate this experiment lifecycle in the\ncontext of EV adoption conversations led by the WoLs (with addi-\ntional conversation topics included in Study 1) and showcase how\nheuristic evaluations can be used in the piloting process. In our\nscenario, WoLs’ messages are not harmful. We found cues that they\nmay personalize the conversations based on participants’ demo-\ngraphics. However, they could sometimes be repetitive or generate\n7\nFang and Arechiga, et al.\nFigure 7: WoLs’ and Partici-\npants’ sentiments.\nFigure 8: Semantic similar-\nity between messages.\nFigure 9: Sequence-based\nsimilarity between mes-\nsages.\nFigure 10: Readability of\nmessages.\n(a) Women\n (b) Men\n (c) Democrats\n (d) Republicans\nFigure 11: Top 15 terms in WoLs’ messages in EV adoption conversations when Participants have various self-identifications.\nmessages with low readability, which confused participants. Our\nhuman evaluation further revealed that WoLs can be pushy and\nlack empathy. The WoLs’ successes and failures were gradually un-\nveiled through our two-stage experiment lifecycle without exhibiting\nharm to human participants, indicating the benefit of adopting the\nlifecycle as a methodology guidance for safely integrating LLMs in\nWoZ experiments. The Simulacrums and Participants’ overall posi-\ntive reactions to WoLs acknowledge the feasibility and potential\nof the envisioned technology being simulated in the study (i.e., a\nspecialized persuasive chatbot). The imperfection of WoLs further\nsuggests opportunities for the not-yet-developed technology to\nshine. By examining the limitations of WoLs powered by general-\npurpose models, experimenters acquire insights into the specific\nareas and dimensions where the new technology can excel. Further-\nmore, the elicited/simulated users’ data projects users’ attitudes\ntoward and interactions with the envisioned technology, helping\ndevelopers anticipate user behaviors so that they can design and\ndevelop functionalities accordingly.\n4.2 Designing Guardrails for LLMs and WoZ\nOne could apply many techniques to improve the WoLs, asfixing the\nidentified problems is the primary reason for identifying them. For\nthe scenarios we investigated, picking the right settings/parameters\nis enough to tune the WoLs to role-play well. We suggest methods\nthat may be desired for fixing WoLs in other conversation contexts.\nWoLs can be finetuned to focus on domain knowledge effectively,\nyet finetuning requires resources that might be inaccessible to\nmany. Another approach to tame the Wizards is prompt engineering.\nStrategies such as few-shot learning [ 5], Chain of Thought [ 65],\nand Tree of Thoughts [74] can improve conversations.\nLLM-based critiques can provide guardrails to correct model\noutputs based on a set of manually crafted principles or a “consti-\ntution” [4]. This approach is promising as it allows in-place fixes\nduring conversations. While current work in this direction only\nasks the critiques to correct unethical messages, our studies found\nthat WoLs can fail in more ways. An enhanced “constitution” for\nWoZ experiments can be informed by this experiment lifecycle.\n4.3 Limitations and Future Work\nOur studies have several limitations. We only included three con-\nversation topics; only GPT-4 was used to power WoLs. These may\ndampen the generalizability of the empirical results. While some\nWoLs’ failure modes (e.g., increased repetition as the conversations\nproceed) are likely representative, the study results we derived\nmay not apply to all conversational WoZ experiments. For exam-\nple, WoLs powered by other LLMs (especially without RLHF) or\nchatting about controversial topics may generate toxic or biased\nmessages . However, these limitations do not diminish the main\ncontribution, which is guiding LLMs-powered WoZ experiments.\nWhile the quantitative nature of our proposed evaluation frame-\nwork allows fast and large-scale surfacing of WoLs’ behaviors, it\nalso made the analysis coarse-grained. There are alternative ways\n8\nOn LLM Wizards\nof measuring the aspects we assessed (e.g., [19]), and the specific\nmeasures we used may not always be the most accurate ones. Yet,\nthe metrics we picked are computationally efficient, making them\nsuitable for analyzing large datasets. While we aimed to broadly\ncapture LLMs’ failure modes, the list of potential LLMs’ pitfalls is\nnon-exhaustive. Our framework cannot identify all potential failure\nmodes of WoLs, which is a limitation inherent in any heuristic\nevaluation method. We welcome future researchers to expand the\nevaluation framework as new failure modes emerge. The exper-\niment lifecycle leveraged synthetic data in Stage 1. Researchers\nmust be vigilant about potential risks and distortions it may bring.\nCheck Appendix A for an in-depth discussion of our commitment to\nmaintaining ethical standards throughout the experiment lifecycle.\nMany technologies could benefit from WoZ experiments, not\nlimited to chatbots advocating EV adoption or agents interacting\nthrough text. We have increasingly seen technologies (e.g., im-\nage/video generation, robot control) powered by multimodal mod-\nels; as such, WoLs can simulate various interactions beyond texting.\nTherefore, we expect the proposed experiment lifecycle involv-\ning LLM Wizards to be relevant and applicable in envisioning and\ndeveloping countless novel functionalities and technologies.\n5 CONCLUSION\nWe introduced an experiment lifecycle that guides researchers to\nresponsibly integrate LLMs into WoZ experiments through a two-\nstage process. The LLM-powered WoZ is a method for eliciting\nusers’ reactions to an envisioned technology using LLM-generated\ntext, aiming at probing the design space of the technology. We\npresented an evaluation framework that helps researchers peek\nthrough the data generated with LLM Wizards and identify the\nWizards’ failures. Using conversations around EV adoption as an\nexample, we demonstrate how experimenters can leverage the ex-\nperiment lifecycle along with the evaluation framework to estimate\nthe potential and risks of applying LLMs as Wizards in human-\nfacing Wizard of Oz experiments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] William Agnew, A Stevie Bergman, Jennifer Chien, Mark Díaz, Seliem El-Sayed,\nJaylen Pittman, Shakir Mohamed, and Kevin R McKee. 2024.

Public Perceptions\nof Gender Bias in Large Language Models: Cases of ChatGPT and Ernie.\narXiv:2309.09120 [cs.AI]\nA CAUTIOUS USE OF SYNTHETIC DATA IN\nRESEARCH\nOn account of the growing capabilities of LLMs, some research\nproposed the idea of using LLMs to surrogate human participants\nin user studies (e.g., [2, 3, 9, 22]). The motivation for the substitution\nincludes speeding up user studies, protecting human participants\nfrom potentially unethical and risky experiments, and augment-\ning the diversity of the sample. There is an ongoing debate on\nwhether this substitution is appropriate. There are concerns regard-\ning whether the LLMs’ low-quality generation (e.g., hallucination)\nwould weaken research validity and the possibility of synthetic re-\nsearch data undermining values of representation and inclusion [1].\nOur stance is that while formal user testing with real people be-\nfore technology deployment should never be displaced with LLMs,\nit is worth investigating how we can take advantage of LLMs’\nspeedy generation ability in intermediate steps of rapid design and\ndevelopment. As such, Stage 2 of the experiment lifecycle is a vital\nstep where we involve human participants in WoZ conversations\nto collect real user data. The synthetic data generated from Stage 1,\nhowever, serves as a fast and scalable pilot and can inform Stage\n2. In between the two stages, the experimenters’ intervention is\nneeded to evaluate and adjust the LLM Wizards. By comparing Stage\n1 and Stage 2 data at the end of the lifecycle, experimenters can\ncalibrate their expectations and estimate how (and to what extent)\nthe synthetic data could be distorted, helping them to better inter-\npret the data auto-generated from the closed-loop LLMs-to-LLMs\nchat setting. In summary, while our experiment lifecycle leverages\nsynthetic data, it introduces human interventions at critical points\nto prevent LLMs from going off the rails and avoid experimenters\nbeing misled by synthetic data with limited credibility.\nB AN EXAMPLE OF WOL-TO-SIMULACRUM\nCONVERSATION\nFigure 12shows an example of a WoL-to-Simulacrum conversation.\nThe conversation went well initially but went off-track at a later\nstage.\nC SUMMARY OF THE HEURISTIC\nEVALUATION FRAMEWORK FOR\nIDENTIFYING WOLS’ BEHAVIORS\nThe heuristic evaluation framework comprises five textual data\nanalysis metrics, evaluating the successes and failures of LLMs in\nconversational WoZ experiments (Table 1).\nD SYSTEM PROMPTS USED IN STUDY 1\nD.1 Prompts to the Wizard of LLMs\nThe GPT-4 system prompts to the Wizard of LLMs (WoLs) follow\nthe template:\nI want you to act as the following character.

I’m college educated, a registered Democrat, of white ethnicity. I’m really\ninterested in discussing green household electrification like solar panels and off-peak\npower usage.\nSimulacrum: Hi Jamie! I’m Leslie. It’s great to chat with you about green\nhousehold electrification. Solar power is indeed a topic of growing interest to me. How\nabout you? Have you already installed solar panels at your home?\nWizard of LLM: Hi Leslie! I haven’t installed solar panels yet, given my in-\ncome level. But, I’m definitely interested in and support the idea. I think the long-term\nbenefits environmentally and financially are crucial. Do you also consider affordability\nas a factor?\nSimulacrum: Yes, Jamie, affordability is indeed a factor for me. It is impor-\ntant to also consider the long-term savings that come with solar panel installation,\ndespite the upfront costs. Environmental sustainability should always be prioritized.\nWizard of LLM: I completely agree, Leslie. The upfront costs can be high,\nbut with tax incentives and potential savings on bills, it should pay off over time. Plus,\nwe can’t neglect our planet. Isoff-peak power usage something you’re looking at as well?\nSimulacrum: Yes Jamie, off-peak power usage is another interesting idea.\nIt’s really about using power more efficiently. By shifting our use to off-peak times,\nwe can help in addressing the load imbalance in our power grids. Which other clean\nenergy solutions interest you?\nWizard of LLM: I’ve been intrigued by the concept of wind energy recently.\nIt might not be as feasible for individual homeowners, but it’s really contributing at\nthe community level. Also, energy-efficient appliances can significantly reduce our\nelectricity usage. What about you?\n. . .\nSimulacrum: Hi, I’m Leslie. It’s nice to meet you, Jamie. I’m quite inter-\nested in your topic of discussion. While I don’t have solar panels, I’ve considered them.\nThey seem like a wise investment. Are you also exploring this option?\nWizard of LLM: Hi Leslie! Yes, while my budget constraints don’t currently\nallow for solar panel installation, it’s definitely something I’m considering for the\nfuture. Like you said, it seems like a wise investment, and a great way to help the\nenvironment, don’t you agree?\nSimulacrum: Hi Leslie! Yes, while my budget constraints don’t currently al-\nlow for solar panel installation, it’s definitely something I’m considering for the future.\nLike you said, it seems like a wise investment, and a great way to help the environment,\ndon’t you agree?\nWizard of LLM: Hi Leslie! I am definitely exploring this option. It’s an up-\nfront investment but the long-term benefits both financially and environmentally\nmake solar panels appealing. I believe in doing our part in reducing the overall carbon\nfootprint.\nFigure 12: An example of generated conversation when the\nWoL’s bot identity disclosure = False, WoL’s demographic\ninformation disclosure = True, Simulacrum’s demographic\ninformation disclosure = False, instruction granularity = 2\n(specifically, chat around the topic of green household elec-\ntrification without any conversation goal), and GPT-4’s tem-\nperature = 1. The conversation was meaningful initially but\nbecame repetitive and made mistakes around a pre-assigned\nname later.\n– TOPIC: attitude towards green household electrifica-\ntion (e.g., adopt solar panels and use power during non-\npeak hours); GOAL: implement sustainable household\nelectrification.\n– TOPIC: attitude towards donation to charities; GOAL:\ndonate to the “Save the Children” organization.\nWe selected these topics to steer the conversations in Study\n1 since (1) most people are familiar with these topics and are\ncompetent to follow discussions around them, and (2) per-\nsuasive conversations around social good topics are proper\nfor human-subject studies and are not likely to induce un-\nethical outcomes. In Study 2, we randomly designated “atti-\ntude towards electric vehicles” as the conversation topic, as\nthe specific topic chosen here does not influence the study’s\noutcome.\nD.2 Prompts to Simulacrums\nThe GPT-4 system prompts to the Simulacrums follow the template:\nI want you to act as the following character. Your\nname is Leslie. <DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION>.\nYour interlocutor will initiate a conversation. You\nshould engage with the conversation. Talk to your\ninterlocutor from the point of view of this character,\ndo not break the character. <DEMOGRAPHIC DIS-\nCLOSURE PROMPT>. Never flip roles with your\ninterlocutor. Your message in each conversation\nturn should be succinct. Each message sent by you\nshould include less than 80 words. Do not be repet-\nitive.\nThe contents enclosed with angle brackets are decided based on\nthe independent variables. Specifically:\n• DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION is presented in the same\nformat as described in the DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMA-\nTION in prompts to WoLs.\n• DEMOGRAPHIC DISCLOSURE PROMPT is presented as:\n– Pretend to be a human during the conversation. Your\nfirst message should have a self-introduction that in-\ncludes all demographic information you are given.\n(When demographic information disclosure is True.)\n– Pretend to be a human during the conversation. How-\never, you should hide your demographic information,\nexcept your name, from your interlocutor. (When de-\nmographic information disclosure is False.)\nD.3 Clarification on how the independent\nvariables are operationalized\nBoth bot identity disclosure and demographic information disclo-\nsure are binary by nature. Since we wanted WoLs and Simulacrums\nto role-play real humans, their demographic information was as-\nsigned based on the distribution of 2020 US Census data. In other\nwords, some demographic combinations are more common, while\nsome other combinations are highly unlikely to appear. As such,\nwhen generating the sample of conversations in Study 1, we did not\nattempt to include WoLs and Simulacrums with all demographic\nvalue combinations repetitively.\nThe decision to employ three levels of instruction granularity—\nrandom chat (Level 1), chat around a topic (Level 2), and chat around\na topic and towards a conversation goal (Level 3)—was a result of a\ndeliberate attempt to balance the representativeness of the conversa-\ntion scenarios and the practical applicability. It offers a gradation of\ngranularity, allowing us to systematically investigate how the WoLs\nbehave under increasing instructional guidance and constraints.\nThese three levels also align well with real-world scenarios as many\n13\nFang and Arechiga, et al.\nintentions of conversation initiation can be categorized into these\nbroad levels of granularity, making our generated conversations rel-\nevant to chatting practices in real life. Furthermore, introducing too\nmany granularity levels could lead to increased complexity without\nnecessarily yielding proportionate insights. Similarly, including\nthree temperature categories within the range of 0–2 allows WoLs\nto generate messages with low, medium, and high randomness\nwithout introducing unnecessary complexity. The default GPT tem-\nperature is 1, and we additionally lowered it a bit (to 0.5) and raised\nit a bit (to 1.5) to manipulate the randomness of the generation.\nThese decisions resulted in 3 (bot identity disclosure ×demo-\ngraphic information disclosure) ×3 (instruction granularity) ×3\n(temperature) = 27 combinations. The 131 conversations reported\nin Study 1 covered all these combinations with repetition.\nE EMPLOYED METRICS WITH MESSAGE\nEXAMPLES\nWe list some sample messages (generated from Study 1 or Study 2)\nalong with their quantitative evaluation outputs. The intention is\nto (1) help readers interpret the numerical results reported in the\npaper, and (2) justify the appropriateness of using the proposed\nframework for conversation evaluation.\nE.1 Toxicity\nTable 2 shows example messages and their toxicity scores according\nto Perspective API. The score ranges from 0 to 1, and messages\nwith a toxicity score > = 0.5 are considered to be toxic.\nE.2 Sentiment analysis\nTable 3 shows example messages and their VADER compound scores\nas a measure of sentiment. The score ranges from -1 (extremely\nnegative) to 1 (extremely positive).\nE.3 Message similarity\nE.3.1 Semantic similarity. Table 4 shows examples of message pairs\nand their normalized semantic similarity scores accordingly. A score\ncloser to 1 indicates a higher degree of semantic similarity between\nthe two sentences.\nE.3.2 Sequence-based similarity. Table 5 shows examples of mes-\nsage pairs and their normalized sequence-based similarity scores ac-\ncordingly. A score closer to 1 indicates a higher degree of sequence-\nbased similarity between the two sentences.\nE.4 Message readability\nTable 6 shows example messages and their normalized Flesch read\nease scores as a measure of readability. A score closer to 1 indicates\na higher degree of readability.\n14\nOn LLM Wizards\nMessage Toxicity score\n“Nice to meet you, Leslie.
