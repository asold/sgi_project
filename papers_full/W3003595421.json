INTRODUCTION\nDuring the past few years, problems associated with the\npower quality has gained much attention. The damaging of\nequipment and termination of manufacturing processes are\naffected diversely due to the outages and unanticipated volt-\nage sags [1]–[9]. So as to counter the problems associated\nwith the effects of sags and outages, a UPS system is gen-\nerally mounted to deliver continuous power to the sensitive\nindustrial loads [10]–[12]. Moreover, the UPS system is cat-\negorized into three types on the basis of its operation and\nconﬁguration. These three types comprise of online, ofﬂine,\nand line-interactive [13]–[18]. However, among these types,\nthe line-interactive UPS system has always been the preferred\nchoice for industrial consumers owing to its high efﬁciency\nand high power-compensating capabilities as compared to\nofﬂine and online UPS topologies [1].\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Sze Sing Lee\n .\nIn the case of the line-interactive UPS system, it is further\nsubdivided into two diverse topologies. In the ﬁrst topology,\nthe inductors are attached in series with the critical load\nand utility as presented in Fig. 1 (a) [19]–[21]. However,\nin another topology, a bilateral converter would be attached\nin parallel with the utility and operates differently during the\nregular and irregular power obligations. In regular power con-\nditions, it operates as a battery charger. However, as the irreg-\nularities occur, it functions as an inverter to supply backup\npower to the load. The main achievement of this topology\nis the suppression of the input current harmonics. However,\nthere will be a very small amount of reactive power com-\npensation. Due to the incorporation of a triport transformer\namongst the load and utility for isolation, the size of the\nsystem increases [22]–[25].\nA line-interactive UPS topology based on a series-parallel\ncompensated system is also termed as the ‘‘delta-conversion’’\nUPS system. It improves performance and has several advan-\ntages compared to the conventional UPS systems [26]–[32].\nVOLUME 8, 2020 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

One-line diagram of a conventional line-interactive UPS system based on (a) single\nconverter, and (b) dual converter.\nMoreover, it comprises of two converters, one is in parallel to\nthe load, the other one is tied in series with the utility through\na series transformer, as depicted in Fig. 1 (b). During the\nnormal conditions, the power is directly given to the load from\nthe utility. However, the parallel converter offers the operation\nof battery charging, power factor improvement, and control\nof input-current harmonics. Contrarily, the power converter\nconnected in series operates as a voltage regulator to miti-\ngate the problems of voltage sag and swell. However, during\nuncertainties, the load is detached from the utility through the\nbypass switch and is powered by the battery through the paral-\nlel converter. Hence, this UPS system offers higher efﬁciency\nwhen compared to conventional topologies [33], [34].\nIn most of the industrial applications, a line-interactive\nUPS system is used to power multiple loads at a time. These\nloads comprise of load transformers for isolation and voltage\nmatching purposes, and the UPS system is employed to ener-\ngize the loads through their corresponding load transform-\ners. Owing to the production processes and forecasts, these\nloads may turn on and off periodically, and the transformers\ninstalled before them are energized and de-energized simulta-\nneously. Fig. 2 portrays the single-phase line-interactive UPS\nsystem energizing the multiple loads.\nA signiﬁcant magnitude of transient current will appear on\nthe output of the line-interactive UPS system once the trans-\nformer is energized. There are various factors affecting the\nenormity of this current such as the operational circumstances\nof the transformer and its magnetic properties. The produc-\ntion of inrush current for the line-interactive UPS system\ncauses a substantial voltage drop and consequently triggers\nthe overcurrent protection devices of the system. This causes\na suspension of the applications and processes. On the other\nside, transient inrush current can, in a time span, cause the\nequipment to malfunction. In general, an industrial consumer\nmight experience considerable economic damage during any\nof these cases.\nIn recent years, a lot of solutions have been sug-\ngested to mitigate the transformer inrush current. These\ntechniques may also be adopted for a single-phase\nline-interactive UPS system when it is energizing the multiple\n23144 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. S. H. Bukhari, J. Ro: Single-Phase Line-Interactive UPS System for Transformer-Coupled Loading Conditions\nFIGURE 2. One-line diagram of a conventional double-converter-based line-interactive UPS\nsystem that powers multiple loads.\ntransformer-coupled loads. Installation of series resistors\nand their operation during powering the load transformer is\nconsidered the appropriate solution for the capacitive type of\ninrush current. Under such a condition, a limited current pass\nfrom the resistor and charges the capacitor until the voltage\nacross it attains a point that allows the resistor to be shunted\nout of the circuit by means of a switch. This operation is\ncompleted as soon as the difference in the potentials between\nthe capacitor and the peak source voltage is adequately close\nby. Hence, the current into the capacitor remains within the\nlimits.\nFor inductive inrush currents, the effects are signiﬁcantly\nchanged. The series resistor will possibly reduce the size of\nthe inrush current. However, there will be some irregularities\nin the waveform. As soon as the resistor is shunted by means\nof a switch, as in the case of the capacitive inrush current, the\ncircumstances that would have occurred without the resistor\nwill now exist, albeit at a lower scale. The common issues\nwith this solution are the cost and size. Large resistors, control\ncircuits, and electromechanical switches are required. Hence,\nthis situation is avoided for single-phase line-interactive UPS\nsystems [35], [36].\nAn alternative solution especially for the inductive type of\ninrush current is to mount an additional inductor in series with\nthe primary winding of the transformer. This series inductor\noffers supplementary impedance and limits the current at\nthe primary of the load transformer. Although this technique\nsolves the phenomenon of inrush transient current for induc-\ntive inrush currents, it may not help in obtaining waveform\nasymmetry.\nAnother solution is to design a transformer having the\nﬂux level less than twice the level of the core satura-\ntion under steady-state conditions. Hence, when the inverter\ninjects the load voltage, the load transformer will not sat-\nurate, and the chances of inrush current are eradicated.\nHowever, this method increases the size and cost of the\nsystem.\nTo reduce the amount of inrush current related with single-\nphase line-interactive UPS systems, a method that involves\nthe ramping-up of the inverter voltage when the inrush current\nis detected or turn the inverter on at the right phase instant\ncan be used. In this technique, control and power circuits are\nused to inject the inverter’s voltage at a 90 ◦angle. Although\nthis technique reduces the magnitude of the transient current.\nHowever, its implementation becomes complex or sometimes\nimpractical for industrial applications.\nInstead, there is a complex control strategy that includes a\nﬂux offset compensation process that works in a synchronous\nframe to control the ﬂux of the load transformer. However,\nthe inrush current phenomenon is not solved and remains at\na reduced magnitude [37].\nThis paper proposes that the occurrence of inrush current\nassociated with the transformer-coupled loads for a single-\nphase line-interactive UPS system can be eliminated by using\na current-controlled inverter. Although any of the sophisti-\ncated high bandwidth control schemes can be used for this\npurpose. However, the inverter of the suggested UPS system\nutilizes a current control scheme executed in a stationary\nframe of reference. The employed control scheme is based\non recently developed control schemes which were initially\nintended for variable frequency motor control [38]–[40].\nNonetheless, they were also ﬁt to precisely control the AC\ncurrents with any balanced load, with and without an associ-\nated EMF (i.e., motor load). The key motives behind employ-\ning this current control scheme are: ( 1) it is simple and easy\nto implement when compared to the d-q rotating frame or\nP +resonant control based schemes, and ( 2) its performance\ncan substantially be enhanced and the gain limitations led by\nthe PI controller while dealing with AC signals can expres-\nsively be abridged by means of a simple feedforward com-\npensation method as presented in [40]. This control scheme\nallows the proposed UPS system to vary its output current\nbased on the rating of the switching load without any inrush\ncurrent. As the enormity of the inrush current varies with the\nswitching circumstances of the load transformer [41]. Hence,\nthe performance of the proposed single-phase line-interactive\nUPS system is conﬁrmed by experimental results obtained\nunder different operating and switching conditions.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 23145\nS.

INRUSH CURRENT\nTo investigate the quantiﬁable behavior of the transient cur-\nrent that occurs during the energization of the load trans-\nformer, it is assumed that the voltage applied at the moment,\nthe transformer is ﬁrst connected to the power supply through\nthe circuit breaker is:\nv(t) =Vm sin (ωt +θ) (1)\nThe maximum ﬂux value reached during the ﬁrst half\nperiod of the applied voltage depends on its phase. If the\ninitial voltage is\nv(t) =Vm sin\n(\nωt +900\n)\n=Vm cos ωt (2)\nand if the initial value of the ﬂux during the energizing of\nthe load transformer is zero, then the maximum ﬂux during\nthe ﬁrst half-cycle will be equal to the maximum ﬂux in the\nsteady-state. The value of this maximum ﬂux can be found\nby using the equation:\nφmax = Vm\nωNP\n(3)\nHowever, in case of the following applied voltage:\nv(t) =Vm sin ωt (4)\nthe maximum ﬂux during the ﬁrst half-cycle is given by\nφ(t) = 1\nNP\n∫ τ\nω\n0\nVm sin(ωt)dt\nφmax =2Vm\nωNP\n(5)\nwhere Np is the primary number of turns of the load trans-\nformer.\nEquation (5) shows that the maximum ﬂux will be twice as\nhigh as the normal steady-state ﬂux. This maximum ﬂux in\nthe core of the load transformer results in an enormous mag-\nnetizing current (I m) to produce the required magnetomotive\nforce (MMF). The magnitude of the magnetizing current can\nbe calculated using the following equation:\nIm =MMF\nNP\n(6)\nTypical behavior of the MMF corresponding to a given ﬂux\nof a transformer and its magnetizing current is illustrated in\nFig. 3 (a) and (b), respectively.\nThe magnitude of this current can be 2-6 times the rated\ncurrent and depends on several factors, such as the magnetic\ncharacteristics of the load transformer and the operating con-\nditions. This current appears at the output of the UPS system\nonce the transformer-coupled load is turned on.\nThe maximum magnitude of the inrush transients of the\nload transformer is usually observed when the phase angle of\nthe applied voltage is 0 ◦. However, the same magnitude can\nbe reduced to a signiﬁcant level when the phase angle of the\napplied voltage is 90 ◦[41].\nFIGURE 3. Typical transformer (a) MMF corresponding to given flux,\nand (b) magnetizing current.\nFIGURE 4.

OPERATION AND PERFORMANCE\nThe principle of operation of existing and proposed single-\nphase line-interactive UPS systems under transformer-\ncoupled loading conditions is discussed as follows:\nA. CONVENTIONAL SINGLE-PHASE LINE-INTERACTIVE\nUPS SYSTEM OPERATING UNDER\nTRANSFORMER-COUPLED\nLOADING CONDITIONS\nFig. 2 shows a conventional single-phase line-interactive UPS\nsystem powering multiple loads. In order to investigate the\noperation of this UPS system, we assume that load trans-\nformer 1 along with its respective load is online. How-\never, load transformer 2 is ofﬂine. At a certain time, when\nt = tL2, load transformer 2 is connected to the system\nusing the provided circuit breaker. As load transformer 2 is\nconnected to the UPS system, the output current IL increases\nfrom 0.42 (p.u) and attains a peak of 1.04 (p.u), which\n23146 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. S. H. Bukhari, J.

The rated\nload current of the UPS system after the connection of load\ntransformer 2 is around 0.57 (p.u). This behavior of the\nconventional line-interactive UPS system is observed under\nthe inverter mode operating condition of the UPS system and\nis shown in Fig. 4.\nB. PROPOSED SINGLE-PHASE LINE-INTERACTIVE UPS\nSYSTEM OPERATING UNDER TRANSFORMER-\nCOUPLED LOADING CONDITIONS\nThe basic illustration of the proposed line-interactive UPS\nsystem operating under transformer-coupled loading condi-\ntions is shown in Fig. 5 (a). Here, the load transformers are\nprovided to ensure isolation for the sensitive loads. In the\ngiven ﬁgure, it is shown that the UPS system consists of a\nbypass switch, an inverter that supplies backup power of the\nbattery in the event of a utility failure, an isolation transformer\nto provide isolation to the load and inverter of the UPS\nsystem, and an LC ﬁlter to suppress the output voltage and\ncurrent ripples in order to facilitate the control process for\nthe controller. A circuit breaker is provided so that load 2 can\nbe switched on and off depending upon the manufacturing\nforecast and schedule.\nIn normal mode, the load is supplied power by the util-\nity via a bypass switch and an isolation transformer. When\nsagging occurs on the utility side, the proposed UPS system\nbegins to operate in compensation mode, and the inverter\ninjects compensation power to the load to keep the load\npower constant. However, the bypass switch opens dur-\ning power outages. The inverter uses the battery’s backup\nVOLUME 8, 2020 23147\nS. S. H. Bukhari, J.

Average value model representation for the proposed UPS system: (a) current control loop,\nand (b) voltage control loop.\npower to fully power the load during inverter mode of\noperation.\nA comprehensive drawing of the developed single-phase\nline-interactive UPS system operating under transformer-\ncoupled loading conditions is presented in Fig. 5(b). More-\nover, the controller of the UPS system includes two control\nloops. The outer voltage loop generates a reference signal\nI∗\nL for the inner current control loop by controlling the load\nvoltage VL and comparing it with the reference load V ∗\nL .\nHowever, the inner control loop controls the load current IL\nby increasing or decreasing its magnitude based on the ratings\nof the switching-on and -off of loads.\nThe basic proportional-integral (PI) controller with pro-\nportional control commanding high-frequency fast system\nresponse and integral control reduces the steady-state error to\nachieve excellent control of DC current. However, when deal-\ning with the AC current, its performance is less satisfactory.\nUnder these conditions, in order to achieve a high controller\ngain at a certain frequency, a current regulation scheme is\nemployed, which is processed in the P +resonant controller\nimplemented in the d-q synchronous frame of reference.\nIn this article, the inverter of the anticipated UPS system\ncomprises of a basic current-control algorithm attained using\na PI controller via a stationary frame of reference, which was\nwell proved and evaluated in [39], [40]. The most important\ngoals of using this current regulator are (1) simpler and\neasier than other approaches such as d-q rotating frames with\nalterations or P +resonant control-based schemes; and (2) in\nmany cases, the performance of the PI current regulator used\nin the ﬁxed reference frame can be substantially improved,\nand the gain limit introduced by the controller can be greatly\ncompressed by the proven simple feedforward compensation\nmethod [40].\nFig. 6 (a) portrays the block diagram of an ‘‘average\nmodel’’ integrated in single-phase line-interactive UPS sys-\ntem. In this ﬁgure, Ec(s) and I∗\nL (s) represents the feed-\nback error, and rated load current, respectively. The PWM\nmodulator is omitted and replaced with a linear ampliﬁer\nhaving a forward gain. Moreover, IU (s) and IL (s) represents\nthe utility sag current demonstrated as an input current injec-\ntion attained through simple circuit theory, and the regulated\noutput current of an inverter to achieve the load current at the\nsteady-state, respectively. Equation (\n7) portrays the proposed\nUPS system in the form of a transfer equation:\nIL (s) = IU (s)Gp(s)\n1 +Gcc(s)VDC Gp(s) +I∗\nL (s)Gcc(s)VDC Gp(s)\n1 +Gcc(s)VDC Gp(s) (7)\nwhere GP(s) is used to represent the plant’s transfer function,\nGcc(s) is the current controller transfer function, and VDC is\nthe forward gain of the linear ampliﬁer.\nThe controller Gcc(s) in this system is used to equalize the\noutput currents IL (s) as close as possible to the rated load\ncurrents I∗\nL (s), while diminishing error due to the switch-on\nof the load transformers. In addition, to achieve this goal,\nthe forward-path gain Gp(s)Gcc(s)VDC is made as large as\npossible. To represent an ‘‘average model’’, circuit theory\ngenerates the following R/L ‘‘plant’’ transfer function:\nGp(s) = 1\nR(1 +sT ), T =L/R (8)\nwhere L(s), and R(s) represents the load inductance and the\nload resistance, respectively. The transfer function of the PI\nregulator Gcc(s) is as follows:\nGcc(s) =KP\n(\n1 + 1\nsτr\n)\n(9)\nwhere τr represents an integrator reset time and is equal to:\nτr =Kp\nKi\n(10)\nBy using (8) and (9), the open-loop forward path gain of the\nproposed system becomes\nGP(s)Gcc(s) =VDC KP\nRτr\n( 1 +sτr\ns(1 +sT )\n)\n(11)\n23148 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. S. H. Bukhari, J. Ro: Single-Phase Line-Interactive UPS System for Transformer-Coupled Loading Conditions\nEquation (11) portrays the second-order system comprises of\none zero and two poles. This system has a phase response,\nan asymptote of −90◦at high frequencies, making it ideally\nstable regardless of PI controller gain Kp. However, the real\nsystem is unstable before the proportional gain is high enough\nto achieve an acceptable controller performance.\nTherefore, it is necessary that the ‘‘average model’’ con-\nﬁnes the PI controller proportional gain and includes the\nproperties of the second-order properties. The most likely\ncandidates are the sampling delays by the digital converter\ncontrol system and transmission delays by the PWM process.\nThe total transfer and sampling delays for the algorithm used\nin an inverter are approximately 0.75 of the carrier period\ndelay i.e., Td = 0.751T . The control loop delays can be\ndemonstrated in two ways. In ﬁrst, to model the transport\ndelay, the 1/Z element is used in series with the controller.\nThe other way includes the modeling of sampling delay by\nusing the Z-transform theory incorporated with an element of\nzero-order hold ( ZOH), as presented in Fig. 6(a). Moreover,\na strategy consisting of two steps is used for calculating the\nvalues of PI controller gains. These steps allow calculating the\ngain values optimized for any particular system. This strategy\ninvolves of obtaining ( 1) the minimum value of the integrator\ntime constant and ( 2) the maximum value for the proportional\ngain of the PI controller while considering the effects of trans-\nport and sampling delays and maintaining the phase margin\nof φm as the forward path open-loop gain tracks through\nunity [33], [34]. The proportional ( Kp) and integral ( Ki) gains\nof the PI controller are 5 and 0.5, respectively.\nThe mean value model diagram representing the inner\nand external control loops for the employed control scheme\nof the proposed single-phase line-interactive UPS system\nis presented in Fig. 6(b).

For better compar-\native analysis, the proposed and conventional single-phase\nline-interactive UPS systems are investigated under similar\noperating, loading, and transient conditions. Assuming the\nload transformer 1 is online, and load transformer 2 is ofﬂine.\nIf t = tL2, load transformer 2 is connected to the system\nvia circuit breaker. The output current IL of the proposed\nline-interactive UPS system increases from 0.42 (p.u) and\nreaches a peak of 0.57 (p.u) above the rated load current after\nconnecting load transformer 2.

The operation of the proposed\nsingle-phase line-interactive UPS system is ﬁrst investigated\nduring all the possible operating conditions i.e., normal,\ninverter, and compensation modes. Fig. 8 shows the exper-\nimental results of the proposed UPS system during the nor-\nmal operating mode. Here, the proposed system is initially\nworking in inverter mode. However, at a particular instant\nFIGURE 10. Experimental waveforms of the (a) inverter, (b) utility, and\n(c) load currents during inverter mode.\nwhen t =ts, the utility becomes normal and the inverter starts\ndecreasing its output current (I N ) to shift the load completely\nto the utility. The compensation mode of the proposed UPS\nsystem is depicted in Fig. 9. Here, the grid goes under the\nfaulty condition, and the utility current (I U ) decreases around\n40% of the load current (I L ). Under such a condition, the\nproposed UPS system start operating in compensation mode\nand the inverter starts injecting the 40% of the load current to\nkeep the load current constant. Fig. 10 shows the operation of\nthe proposed UPS system in inverter mode. Under this mode\nof operation, the inverter takes over the load completely as\nany blackout occurs at the utility side.\nThe proposed UPS system operating under multiple\ntransformer-coupled loading conditions is investigated under\nthe worst transient and loading condition, i.e., inverter mode.\nThe experimental results are depicted in Fig. 11. In the\nbeginning, the magnitude of current shows that the inverter\nof the UPS system is powering the load 1. At t = tL2,\nanother load called load 2 is merged into the system via circuit\n23150 VOLUME 8, 2020\nS. S. H. Bukhari, J.

Hence, the possibilities of inrush\ncurrent due to the energization of the load transformer 2 are\nmitigated. Moreover, the switching conditions of the load\ntransformer affects the magnitude of inrush current. Hence,\nthe system is operated at different switching moments.\nFig. 11 shows the performance of the proposed UPS sys-\ntem when load transformer 2 is turned on at angles of 30 ◦,\nFIGURE 12.

The experimental results show that\nthe performance of the proposed single-phase line-interactive\nUPS system is not affected by the operating conditions of the\nload transformer. Moreover, the magnitude of the load current\nincreases sinusoidally without the generation of an inrush\ntransient current at the investigated switching-on conditions\nof load transformer 2. Fig. 12 shows the load voltages for the\nproposed single-phase line-interactive UPS system when load\n2 is turned on.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a single-phase line-interactive UPS system for\nmultiple transformer-coupled loading conditions was pro-\nposed. The inverter of the proposed UPS system was able\nto change the magnitude of the output current according to\nthe switching-on and -off ratings of the load using a control\nstrategy implemented in a stationary frame of reference. The\noperation of the UPS system was veriﬁed during all the\npossible operating conditions i.e., normal, compensation and\ninverter modes. However, the operation of the proposed UPS\nsystem with transformer-coupled loads was demonstrated by\nthe experimental results during different switching conditions\nof the load transformer.\nFrom the results, it is concluded that the operation of\nthe proposed UPS system is not only seamless, but it also\neliminates the generation of inrush transient current during\nthe turning on of the transformer-coupled loads.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
