    "abstract": "On the base of damage rate analysis of power transformers and methods of EES modes control, the necessity of using the results of on-line diagnostics of LTC transformers not only for determinations of the expediency of further operation or equipment repair but also for calculation of optimal transformation coefficients (with account of the suggested RRCT) for their application in the process of modes control has been proved.The mathematical model of RRCT is developed to by applying the methods of neural-fuzzy modeling, this model, taking into account both current and retrospective values of diagnostic parameters enables to study the impact of diagnostic parameters of RRCT and determine its current value, which is necessary for automatic and automated reliable and optimal control of EES modes.The improved method of determination of optimal control actions, realized by the LTC transformers by means of comparative analysis of the results of calculation of EES modes with quasi-resistances of the circuit branches, enables to select the transformer and calculate transformation ratios that provide minimal losses of active power, minimal amount of LTC switching.The error of RRCT determination by means of the developed mathematical fuzzy model as compared with the training sample of the model and the opinion of independent experts does not exceed the error of the devices, measuring diagnostic parameters.Such results are explained by complex usage of probability theory methods, neuro-fuzzy modeling and modern software Matlab.Such peculiarity of the suggested method of determining optimal control actions by LTC transformers, as the account of RRCT, in the process of EES mode control provides such advantages as reduction of the damage rate of the equipment, reduction of active power losses in EES. The peculiarities of the method of determining optimal control actions by LTC transformers, with the account of their technical state, open up the prospects of development and introduction of modern microprocessor-based systems of optimal automatic control of LTC transformers in EES.Usage of quasi-resistors of circuit branches, which, unlike the transformers, used for calculation of nominal resistances of the lines, take into account the state of the transformers and possible losses of utility companies due to the possible damages, enables to calculate the EES mode in case of transformers transformation ratio change and by means of comparison of calculated power losses, select the most efficient transformer.Further progress of the given research includes the development of mathematical models of other kinds of high voltage equipment involved in the process of ESS modes control, damage of which is possible.",

Literature review and problem statement\nIn [1], the technique of voltage drop decrease in sep -\narate parts of distribution electric grids is suggested, but \nit does not take into account the technical state of regu -\nlating devices [1]. In [2], on the example of Indian electric \ngrids, the statistics of the increase of power, transmitted \nin electric grid is considered. It is proved that such an \nincrease leads to the overload of some power lines, to the \nrapid aging of high-voltage equipment, to the unwanted \nrapid decrease in the remaining equipment life, to the \nfailure of equipment. As a result, the duration and cost \nof repairing damaged equipment increases and power \nlosses increase in the branches of the circuit of electrical \nsystems, which at the time of repair work in non-optimal \nmodes. It is stated that in order to improve the grid reli -\nability and efficiency of energy transmission, it is neces -\nsary to use power transformers, equipped with LTC and \nautomatic or automated control systems for such LTC \ncontrol. It enables to control power flows in EES by means \nof LTC so that the parameters of electric grids modes were \nwith in the limits of normal optimal values of equipment \n(transmission lines, switching devices, transformers, etc.) \nparameters. \nThis is provided by usage of FACTS technologies. For \ninstance, in [3], the possibilities of using a phase-shift trans -\nformer for power flows change in the electric energy system \nto reduce power losses in the process of energy transmission \nin transmission lines of the Slovak Republic are considered. \nIn [4], the high price of FACTs technologies usage in the \nenergy branch for the reduction of electrical power losses \nis proved. In [5], three variants of power flows control in \nthe electric grid, using three FACTs devices are consider \nwith Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), Static \nSynchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) and phase-shift \ntransformer (PST), but in [3-5] no attention is paid to \nthe state of equipment, used for modes control. In [6], the \nconclusion is made that prolongation of power transformers \noperation term for 20–30 years is more profitable than their \nreplacement by new ones, and the number of power trans -\nformers in the USA, that have been in operation for more \nthan 25 years (certificate resource – 25 years) is approxi -\nmately 65 %.\nThat is why, computer systems performers for on-line \nmonitoring of the high-voltage equipment and its elements \nstate are used [7].\nThe example of such systems could be monitoring sys -\ntems KIN-750 or KIV-500, these systems enable to control \ninsulation of high-voltage equipment and its elements - \nhigh-voltage bushings of power transformers in the process \nof their operation.\nAs it is noted in [8], monitoring of high-voltage equip -\nment provides realization \nof the observation over the values of diagnostic param -\neters and determining the current technical state of that \nequipment\nIn [9], it is stated that the main technical characteristics \nand indices of modern means of monitoring the regimes \nallow improving the reliability of the systems of on-line con -\ntrol of the unified energy system of Ukraine. This is possible \nas a result of new possibilities for the solution of supervision \ncontrol problems. These possibilities emerge as a result of \nintroduction of such means. The results of the power trans -\nformer technical state determination can be used in order to \ndetermine current loading capacity [10]. \nIn [11], it is proved that application of new technologies, \nmethods and control facilities, allows reducing active power \nlosses in electric grids. Account of the current technical \nstate of power transformers with regulation devices under \nvoltage decreases the risk of damage in the process of modes \ncontrol [12].\nIn [13], attention is paid to the system of continuous \nmonitoring of the technical state of power transformers, the \ngiven system is used in the transformers of joint-stock com -\npany “Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Complex”, HYDRAN \nanalyzer, methods of localization and identification of faults, \npractical necessity of partial discharge control is underlined, \nbut the results of diagnostics during optimal modes control \nare not paid attention to.\nIn [14], it is noted that in local electric systems, in order \nto provide stable operation and indices of electric energy \nquality, it is necessary to use modern control systems that \ntake into consideration voltages in nodes and frequency \nand eliminate emergency deviations. At the same time, in \n[15], attention is paid to the modeling of no-stationary crit -\nical operation modes of EES in the process of parameters \nchange in wide limits by means of application of non-linear \nmathematical models. This enables to study the consequenc -\nes of such modes, promptly take measures, aimed at their \nprevention or optimal elimination. In the papers [14, 15], \nthe technical state of the equipment of these systems is \nnot taken into account, this can lead to the damage of the \nequipment and undersupply of energy to the consumers.\nThus, the problem of development of the methods of \ndiagnostics results account during optimal control of EES \nmodes is not solved. \nIt is known that real-time operation control (RTOC) \nin Ukraine is carried by a man. Overloading of this person \nwith a great volume of diagnostic parameters data, especially \nin conditions of limited time for decision-making, leads to \nnon-optimal actions. In the process of modes on-line control, \nespecially post-accident modes, it is expedient to assess the \nstate of equipment by generalized indices, for instance, by \nresidual resources coefficient of the transformers (RRCT). \nThe development of the method of on-line diagnostics of the \ntransformers and the account of RRCT in the process of ESS \nmodes control for minimization of total losses of active pow -\ner are not considered in literature sources and are the subject \nof the authors’ study. \n3. The aim and objectives of the study\nThe aim of the research is the development of the method \nof real-time diagnostics of the transformers with LTC and \naccount of PRCT values in the process of EES modes control \nfor minimization of active power losses. To achieve this aim, \nthe following objectives are to be solved:\n– to substantiate the expediency of applying the results \nof real-time diagnostics of LTC-transformers in the process \nof optimal control of EES modes;\n– to develop a fuzzy model of the residual resource coef -\nficient of the transformers (RRCT);\n– to develop the method of RRCT values and power \ntransformers with LTC state account in the process of EES \nmodes optimal control.\nEastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies  ISSN 1729-3774 4/3 ( 88 ) 2017\n68\n4. Materials and methods of transformers  \ndiagnostic study\nAutomation of the process of power flow control may \nbe provided by means of centralized remotely controlled \nalternative usage of switching devices (LTC) of the trans -\nformers. Under such conditions, there appears the possibility \nof the analysis of control actions of separate LTC on mode \nparameters of EES by means of the feedback. This approach \nimproves the operation quality of adaptive control automatic \nsystems of the LTC position control. For this purpose, at \nconsiderable changes of the load schedule, it is necessary \nto perform ranking of the transformers with LTC by the \nquality of their impact on maintaining optimal parameters \nof the modes.\nRealization of measures, aimed at reduction of pow -\ner losses is limited by the possibilities of the equipment \ninvolved in the provision of optimal mode; namely, by its \ntechnical state. It is known that the damage of high voltage \nequipment during mode control (for instance, power trans -\nformers) leads to losses that considerably exceed the cost \nof electric energy, saved as a result of losses decrease. The \nfailure rate of the out -dated high voltage equipment (power \ntransformers, shunting reactors, instrument current and \nvoltage transformers, switches, etc.) increases, when such \nequipment has been in operation for more than 25 years \n[16]. Taking into consideration the fact that the control of \nEES modes is accompanied by the operation of switching \ndevices, regulation devices of transformers, emergence of \nswitching surges, ferro- resonances, currents increase in \npower and instrument transformers, transmission lines, \netc., the control of modes must be realized, taking into con -\nsideration their technical state [3, 4] and possible expenses \nfor their replacement or repair.\nThus, it is necessary to know the current state of high \nvoltage electric equipment of EES that is in operation during \nmodes control.\n5. Determination of current technical state of power \ntransformers\nWe will consider the method of determination of power \ntransformers current state and RRCT values in the process \nof EES modes optimal control on the example of power high \nvoltage transformers that have on-load-tap changing device.\nWe propose to evaluate the technical state of a pow -\ner transformer by means of the analysis of the value of \nits residual resource coefficient. The power transformer \nresidual resource coefficient has the dimensionality in \nrelative units and can change in the process of operation \nin the range from one (the best technical state) to zero \n(the worst technical state, when the transformer must \nbe removed out of service for inspection, repair, replace -\nment, etc.). Then, we will consider the example of residual \nresource coefficient determination of the transformer \nАТDCTN 125000-330/110. First, we will study the \nstatistics of the failure rate of such transformers. Table 1 \ncontains the example of possible reasons and amount of \ntransformers removal out of service that is close to the \ndata, published in [16, 17].\nTable 1 shows that the transformers are often removed \nout of service due to humidification and contamination of oil \nand insulation, as well as high-voltage inputs defects.\nTable 1 \nReasons of removing out of service power transformers\nTransform-\ner element\nDesigna-\ntion Parameter name Units %\nWindings\nZk Winding deformation 8 1.6\nt0 Deterioration of con-\ntact joints state 10 2\nPi.p\nIdle power that \ncharacterizes of the \nmagnetic quality\n15 3\nInsulation\nRin\nContamination of \nisolation 65 13.4\nW Humidification of the \nisolation 48 10\nBushings kbush Defects of bushings 74 15.2\nOil\nCADGc\nContent of dissolved \ngases 71 14.6\nPCA\nHigh moisture content \nand deviations of other \nparameters of the oil\n43 9\nCADGd Discharges in oil 64 13.2\nLTC kdef.LTC LTC defects 45 9.3\nCooling \nsystem\nImotor or Imt\nThe current of oil \npump drive motor 14 2.9\no\ncoolt Coolers temperature 16 3.3\nTank ktank Tank leakage 12 2.5\nTotal 485 100\nIn Table 1, such symbols are used: Zk is the resistance \nof the transformer windings (during measurements in \nshort – circuit mode); t° is the temperature of contact \npoints (for instance, bushing of the bus duct or with \nwinding lead); Pi.p.  i d l e  m o d e  p o w e r  t h a t  c h a r a c t e r i z e s  \nthe quality of magnetic circuit; Rin is the resistance of \nthe insulation for revealing the contamination and aging \nof solid and liquid insulation (also it is necessary to de -\ntermine the capacity and dielectric loss tangent, also it \nis desirable to determine the degree of polymerization); \nW - humidification of the isolation; kresid.res.bush  or kbush  is \nthe residual resource coefficient of the bushings; CADG C \nis the residual resource coefficient of the transformer by \nthe results of chromatographic analysis of dissolved gas in \nthe transformer oil of the tank and LTC (ethylene, ethane, \nmethane) of the transformer that characterizes oil con -\ntamination by the gases, dissolved in it and among them \nacetylene and hydrogen (for revealing of discharges); PCA \nis the residual resource coefficient of the transformer by \nthe results of physical-chemical analyses of transformer \noil from transformer tank, contactor and LTC tap chang -\ner; CADG d is the residual resource coefficient of the trans -\nformer by the results of chromatographic analysis of the \ndissolved hydrogen and acetylene in the transformer oil of \nthe tank and LTC of the transformer tap changer in order \nto reveal the discharge; kdef.LTC  or kLTC is the coefficient of \nthe transformer LTC residual resource; Im is the current of \nelectric motors oil pumps and fans of cooling system; tcool \nis the coolers temperature; ktank  i s  t h e  r e s i d u al  r e s o u r c e  \nControl processes\n69\ncoefficient of the transformer tank, determined by the \navailability (takes the value “0”) or absence of oil leakage \n(takes the value 1).\nThe task of creating a mathematical model is complicat -\ned with incomplete initial data, when some parameters are \nknown at the time of calculations, for example, because of the \nneed for additional studies. To establish mutual relationships \nof diagnostic parameters, the technology of fuzzy simulation \nis very constructive. This simulation allows obtaining more \nreliable results compared to the results of existing diagnostic \nsystems.\nIn Table 1, under the term the controlled diagnostic \nparameter we mean the parameter, deviation of which \nfrom the norm helped to remove the transformer out of \nservice or was taken into account in the process of its \nremoval out of service. In Table 1, the following diagnos -\ntic parameters are given: parameters , that characterize \nthe state of the windings, insulation, bushings, oil, LTС, \ncooling systems, tank.\nHaving analyzed the data of Table 1, the scheme was cre-\nated that shows whether the impact of diagnostic parameters \non the coefficient of total residual resource of the transform -\ner is dependent or independent (Fig. 1).\nFig. 1 does not show the mutual impact of one controlled \ndiagnostic parameter on the other one, it is shown whether \nthe impact of these parameters on the coefficient of total re -\nsidual resource of the power transformer (PT) is dependent \nor independent. \nIn Fig.1, over the diagnostic parameter, the percentage \namount of revealed faulty transformers by the given param -\neter is shown, that is given in percent of the total amount of \nfaulty transformers, and kres – residual resource coefficient of \nthe transformer (RRCT). \nThe blocks with parameters, whose deviations from the \nnorm substantiate the necessity of removing the transform -\ners out of service, are shown sequentially. In parallel, blocks \nwith parameters are also depicted. A large change in these \nparameters proves the necessity of removing a power trans -\nformer (PT) out of service. PT is repaired in case of devia -\ntion from the norms of these parameters. This is due to the \nrequirements for the reliability of the transformers. In each \nof the given blocks, parallel can be allocated but they are not \nshown to simplify the calculation (for instance, currents of \nelectric motors of oil pumps and fans).\nIn order to obtain the generalized parameter of the \nresidual resource of the transformer, it is proposed to pass \nfrom the known values of diagnostic parameters to the corre-\nsponding values of residual resources coefficients (in relative \nunits) by each diagnostic parameter. This will allow you to \ntake into account the values of all diagnostic parameters and \nthe impact of each of them.\nThese coefficients are defined in relative units by (1) and \nthat is why they characterize the total output of the trans -\nformers from the moment of their technical state control to \ntransition to the boundary state that is residual technical \nresource (12). The residual resource coefficient \n1ik  by the 1\nthi  \ndiagnostic parameter: \n11\n1\n11\n,lim ,cu\n,lim ,\n,\ni ir\ni\ni i in\nxx\nk xx\n-\n= -  (1)\nwhere \n1 ,limix  is the admissible limit normative value of the 1h\nii  \ndiagnostic parameter; \n1 ,i curx  is the value of the 1\nthi  diagnostic \nparameter at the moment of control; \n1i inx  is the initial value \nof the 1h\nii  diagnostic parameter (at the moment of putting \ninto operation of new equipment or after repair), i1 is the \nnumber of the diagnostic parameter.\nWe perform the reduction of the circuit by the following \nexpressions. For serial part of the circuit (Fig. 1), the coef -\nficient of total residual resource is found by the expression:\n. ..\n1\n,p\ntot resid reskk t\nn\nt\nt=\n= ∏  (2)\nwhere kτ is the coefficient of residual resource of PT by the τth \ndiagnostic parameter; τ is the tth diagnostic parameter; n is \nthe amount of blocks in the serial part of the circuit of Fig.1, \npt – the probability of control parameters deviations from \nthe maximum permissible normalized value of this parame -\nter is found by means of the expression (3): \n2\n,yp m\nt\nt =  (3)\nwhere yt is the number of controlled parameter deviations \nfrom the admissible limiting normalized value of this parame-\nter, which were revealed by means of the τth diagnostic param-\neter control (t – for the serial part of the circuit) from the total \nnumber of the revealed deviations of controlled parameters \nfrom the admissible limiting normalized value; m2 is the total \nquantity of the revealed deviations of controlled diagnostic \nparameter from their admissible limiting normalized values.\nFor the parallel part of the circuit, the coefficient of total \nresidual resource is found by the expression (4)\n( )\n1\n,\n1\n11 ,\nm\nрес res j j\nj\nk kp∑\n=\n=- - ∑  (4)\nwhere kres,j  is the coefficient of residual resource of РТ by  \nthe jth diagnostic parameter; j is the number of the  jth diag-\nnostic parameter; m1 is the number of blocks (parameters) in \nthe parallel part of the circuit that is reduced.\nZk Pi,pto Rіn CADGCW kres\n1.6 % 2 % 3 % 10 %\nWindings Oil6.6 %\nkbush PCA CАDGP kLCD Іmt ktank\n13.4 %\n23.4 %\nInsulation Bush.\n14.6 % 9 % 13.2 %\n36.8 % LCD\n9.3 % 2.9 % 3.6 %\n6.5 %\n2.5 %\nTankCooling\nSystem\n15.2 %\no\ncoolt\n Fig. 1.

Neuro-fuzzy model of residual resource coefficient\nFor the creation of a mathematical model of the residual \nresource coefficient of the  transformer, the parameters were \nused, by each of these parameters the conclusion regarding \nthe state of the transformer can be made. But none of these \nparameters completely characterize the technical state of the \ntransformer, it only shows certain changes of the technical \nstate of the power transformer.\nA mathematical model of the residual resource coeffi -\ncient of the transformer was created by means of MatLab. \nUsing this model, it is possible to edit the already created \n(5) probabilistic sample of training data. These data help \nto obtain an analytical dependence of the residual resource \ncoefficient of the transformer on the diagnostic parameters \nin the form of the polynomial. For seven input parameters of \nthe model that randomly changed from 0 to 1, the coefficient \nof total residual resource of the transformer (5) was deter -\nmined, where input parameters of the model were reduced to \nrelative units of their deviation from the norm.\nBy means of Anfis Editor using the hybrid training algo -\nrithm and applying the Sugeno fuzzy inference algorithm, the \nneuro-fuzzy model of the residual resource coefficient of the \ntransformer (using subclusterization method) was obtained.\nFig. 2 contains the copy of the screen saver in the Mat -\nlab environment where the structure of the obtained neural \nnetwork is shown.\nFig. 2. Structure of the Anfis-network of the transformer\nFor each input variable of the neuro-model, four linguis -\ntic terms with Gaussian membership functions were used:\n (6)\nwhere 1σ  and с1 are numerical parameters; 2\n1σ  – in the prob-\nability theory it is called the variance of distribution (14), \nand the second parameter с1 is the mathematical expectation; \ni1 – is the input parameter of the neural-fuzzy model that cor-\nresponds to the diagnostic parameter (i1=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), xi  \nis the value of the i1 th input parameter of the model: x1 - .,windk  \nx2 - .,ink  x3 – ,bushk  x4 – ,oilk  x5 – ,LTCk  x6 - ,coolk  x7 – tan .kk\nThese are such terms as: “normal” values of the diag -\nnostic parameter, “minor deviations” of the diagnostic pa -\nrameter value, “prefault” values of the diagnostic parameter, \n“emergency” value of the diagnostic parameter.\nFor determining the value of the total residual coeffi -\ncient, a fuzzy non-linear autoregressive model of the total \nresidual resource coefficient of the transformer is used.

Each of seven \ninputs has four terms. That is, each set of possible values of \ninput parameters of the model is conventionally divided into \nfour subsets: “normal” values of the input parameter, “minor \ndeviations” of the values of the input parameter, and “pre -\nfault” values of the input parameter, “emergency” values of \nthe input parameter. The degree of membership of each value \nof the input parameter in the corresponding set of values is \ndetermined by a Gaussian membership function. The model \nis intended for determining the numerical value of the total \nresidual resource coefficient of the transformer, that is why \nit has one output. This numerical value is found by means of \nsolving the linear equation that describes the dependence of \nthe coefficient of total residual resource of the transformer on \nthe input parameters.\nThe obtained neuro-fuzzy model allows determining \nthe value of the total residual resource coefficient of the \ntransformer depending on the values of input parameters -  \nresidual resources coefficients by each of the controlled di -\nagnostic parameters. The error of the PPCT mathematical \nmodel changes from +0.004 relative units, if PPCT equals 0, \nto -0.032, when PPCT equals 1.\nDespite the complexity of dependences, the mathemat -\nical model of the residual resource coefficient of the trans -\nformer (11) may be used for programming the fuzzy control -\nler in order to create the device for on-line determination of \nthe transformer state by means of analysis of the residual \nresource coefficient value of the transformer.\n6._Account of the projected current value of the residual \nresource of the transformers in the process of optimal \ncontrol of EES modes\nIt is known that in the process of operation, an energy \nenterprise plans to remove out of service the equipment in \nthe overhaul, the cost of is projected. Removal of the trans -\nformer into overhaul in a planned number of years (T WF) \nof trouble-free operation (12 years) provides for a certain \nlist of works and their expected cost Bohpl. For instance, for \n330/110 kV transformers of 125–250 MVA power, the cost \n(B) of such repair is 770–11550 $. We propose to assume \nthat removal of transformers out of service into current re -\npair requires unscheduled expenses.\nThe cost of repair may increase by the value DВ1, the \ncost of replacement of damaged blocks of the transformer \nand additional work, connected with the replacement. These \ncosts are not provided in case of “typical” planned overhaul \n( )\n.\n1\n1\n,\ni\ni res i\nn\nk\ni\ni\nB Be\nbγ⋅\n=\nD= ⋅ ∑  (12)\nwhere Bi is the cost of replacement of the ith damaged block \nof the transformer and additional work, connected with this \nreplacement, n is the number of damaged blocks that require \nunscheduled replacement; .\ni\nireskb  is the residual resource coef -\nficient of the ith block that requires unscheduled replacement; \nγ and b are the coefficients that characterize the impact of the \nresidual resource coefficient on the expected cost of unsched-\nuled repair or replacement of the ith block of the transformer \n(is determined by means of processing of statistical data).\nRepair cost may increase by the cost of DB2 ( a s  c o m-\npared with expected) in case of enlarged current (instead \nof planned overhaul) repair of the transformer , that has not \noperated for the planned number of years:\n( )\nj(T 1)\n2 1e ,\nj\nj\nВВ\nα-\nD =- ⋅ OH  (13)\nwhere j is the number of the transformer, Tj is the time the ith \ntransformer functioned after putting into operation or after \nthe last overhaul (enlarged current) repair until the moment \nof mode control, λ is the coefficient that characterizes the \nintensity of the ∆B2 cost growth that depends on the trans -\nformer design, operation conditions and modes (is determined \nexperimentally), BOH is the cost of the transformer overhaul.\nIt should be noted that removal of the transformer out \nof service takes place not only as a result of relay protection, \nemergencies control automation operation but also is made \nby a person responsible for safe operation by the results of \ncontrol of diagnostic parameters, the values of which some -\ntimes only approach to limiting values.\n.\n..\ntan\n.\n\"\" \"\"\n\"\" \"\"\n\"\" \"\"\n\"\"\n0.6166 0.4125\n0.4618 1.83 1.804\n0.0462\nwind in\nвв oil\nLTC cool\ntot resid res wind in\nвв oil L C\nk\nT\nc\nIF k normal AND k normal\nAND k normal AND k normal\nAND k normal AND k normal\nAND k normal THEN\nk kk\nkk k\nk\nÎÎ\nÎÎ\nÎÎ\nÎ\n= ⋅ + ⋅+\n+ ⋅+ ⋅+ ⋅ +\n+⋅\ntan.\n.\n.\ntan\ntan\nmin\nmin\nmin\nmin\nmin\nm\n1.96 5.377\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n.\" \"\n\"\"\n\" in\nmi\n\"\n\"\" n\nool\nin\nвush\noil\nk\nk\nLC\ncool\nt\nk\nT\nk\nIF k deviation\nAND k deviation\nAND k deviation\nAND k deviation\nAND k deviation\nAND k deviation\nA\nor\nor\nor\nor\nor\nor\noNDk deviatior n THEN\nk\n+⋅-\nÎ\nÎ\nÎ\nÎ\nÎ\nÎ\nÎ\n.. . .\n.\n.\n.\ntan\n0.0393 0.2609\n0.1086 0.37 0.1459\n0.02387 0.05\n”\n863 0.12\n” ””\n”” ””\n88\n”\not resid res wind in\nв\nk\nush oil LTC\ncool\nwind in\nвush oil\nLTC\nkk\nkk k\nkk\nIF k ANDprefault prefault\nprefault prefault\nprefa\nk\nAND k AND k\nAND k\n=- ⋅ + ⋅ +\n+ ⋅ - ⋅- ⋅ -\n- ⋅- ⋅+\nÎÎ\nÎÎ\nÎ\ntan\ntan\n.\n.. . .\n.\n.\n.\n0,2165 . 0.3714\n0.4678 0,514 0.882\n0.5302 1,406 3.88\n\"\" \"\"\n” ””\n””\ncool\ntot resid res wind in\nвus\nk\nk\nh oil LTC\ncool\nwind in\nв\nlt prefaulAND k\nAND k THEN\nk kk\nk kk\nkk\nIF k emergency ANDk emergency\nAND k\nt\nprefault\nÎ\nÎ\n=- ⋅ - ⋅ -\n- ⋅ - ⋅- ⋅ -\n- ⋅- ⋅+\nÎÎ\n.\n.\ntan\n..\n.\ntan.\n\"\" \"\"\n\"\" \"\"\n\"\"\n0.03166 0.06144\n0.387 0,06 0.3199\n0.026 0,006\nв oil\nLTC cool\ntot resid res wind in\nвush oil LTC\ncool\nk\nk\nemergency ANDk emergency\nANDk emergency ANDk emergency\nANDk emergency THEN\nk kk\nkk k\nkk\nÎÎ\nÎÎ\nÎ\n= ⋅ - ⋅-\n- ⋅ + ⋅+ ⋅ -\n- ⋅- ⋅+\n(11)\n0.003\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl processes\n73\nWithin the context of creation of modern Smart Grids \nand to provide safe, reliable, high-quality and economic effi -\ncient operation of EES, it is necessary to perform the control \nover active power overflow by means of the transformer, \nperforming reliable and information actions on the mode. \nThat is why, we propose to take into account the coefficient \nof regulating transformer limitation:\n, ,, (1 ) ,wind j res j cq jk kB =- ⋅  (14)\nwhere cqВ  is the coefficient of repair cost value growth of \nthe jth transformer.\n1, 2,\n,\n1, .,\n.\njj\ncq j\nj pl j\nBBB BB\nD +D= D+  (15)\nAs an example, we will consider 23 nodes 230/138 \nkV test circuit, (Fig. 3) In branches 11 -9, 12 -14, 12 -\n9, 11 -4, and 3 -7, transformers АТDCTN-63000/230/  \n138, АТDCTN-100000/230/138 and АТDCTN-125000/  \n230/138 are installed.

Discussion of the results of determining optimal \ntransformation ratios of EES transformers, taking into \naccount the state of transformers\nThe error of RRCT determination by means of the de -\nveloped mathematical fuzzy model, as compared with the \ntraining sample and the opinion of independent experts does \nnot exceed the error of the devices, measuring diagnostic \nparameters. Such results are explained by complex usage of \nthe probability theory methods, neuro-fuzzy modeling and \nmodern software Matlab. \nSuch feature of the suggested method for determining the \noptimal control actions of LTC-transformers, as account of \nPPCT, in the process of EES modes control, provides such ad-\nvantages as reduction of the equipment damage rate, decrease \nof active power losses in the EES. Due to the peculiarities \nof the method for determining optimal control actions of \nLTC-transformers, taking into account their technical state, \nthe prospects of development s a n d  i n t r o d u c t i o n  o f  m o d e r n  \nmicroprocessor – based systems of optimal, automatic control \nof LTC of transformers to ESS become possible. \nAs compared with the known method of voltage drop \ncontrol on the branches of EES circuits [1], with the method \nof overloads decrease of transmission lines, at the expense \nof redistribution of power overflows in EES [2], decrease of \nactive power losses in the process of transportation [3] by \nmeans of LTC-transformers, the suggested method allows \nselecting, by means of accounting the suggested RRCT, the \ntransformer for the EES mode control that would simulta -\nneously provide the reduction of power losses and be more \nreliable. \nUsage of quasi-resistances of circuit branches, which, \nunlike the transformers used, in the process of calculation \nof nominal resistances of the branches, take into account the \ntransformers state and possible losses of utility companies \ndue to possible damages, allows calculating the EES mode \nin case of the transformers transformation ratio change and, \nby means of comparison of calculated power losses, selecting \nthe most efficient transformer.\nThe suggested peculiarity of application of the method \nof neuro-fuzzy modeling (usage of the model of the trans -\nformer resource in the training sample instead of measured \nvalues of diagnostic parameters [12] - coefficients of residual \nresource, calculated and partially corrected by independent \nexperts) enables to take into account simultaneous impact \nof the results of both current and periodic control on RRCT.\nThe drawbacks of the suggested mathematical fuzzy \nmodel of RRCT is the necessity of a large data base regarding \nthe coefficient of residual resource of diagnostic parameters \nCRRDP (Coefficient of residual resource of the diagnostic \nparameter) for specific transformers. Attempt to reduce the \ndatabase or use the model of another similar transformer \nresults in the increase of the model error. Limitation on the \nusage of the RRCT model is the necessity of application only \non one – investigated transformer. Therefore, we need mod -\nels for each transformer. The method of determining optimal \ncontrol actions by LTC transformers does not take into ac -\ncount voltage limitations in nodes and current limitations in \nthe branches of the circuit.\nFurther development of the given research will be re -\nalized in the development of mathematical models of other \ntypes of high voltage equipment, involved in the process of \nEES modes control, damage of which takes place in our time \n(Fig. 7).\nProblems of the considered research development are \ncaused by the necessity of long lasting experiments and obser-\nvations over the processes of aging and develop  ment of high \nvoltage equipment damage, processes of ESS modes parame -\nters change not only on computer and mathematical models of \nthe equipment and EES modes and on real equipment.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nа                                           b   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nc                                           d   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ne                                            f   \nFig. 7.

Conclusions\n1. Analysis of the damage rate of power transformers and \nmethods of the EES modes control suggests that it is neces -\nsary to use the results of on-line diagnostics of LTC-trans -\nformers not only to determine the expediency of further \noperation or repair of the equipment, but also for calculation \nof optimal transformation values (with the account of the sug-\ngested RRCT) for their usage in the process of modes control. \n2. By means of the usage of the methods of neural-fuzzy \nmodeling, the model of RRCT is developed. The model \nenables, by means of accounting of both current and retro -\nspective values of diagnostic parameters, to investigate the \ninfluence of diagnostic parameters on RRCT and determine \nits current value. That is necessary for automatic and auto -\nmated reliable and optimal control of EES modes.\n3.  The improved method for determining control actions \nby LTC-transformers, by means of comparative analysis of \nthe results of calculation of EES modes with quasi-resistanc-\nes of circuit branches, enables to select the transformer and \ncalculate the transformation ratio that provides the minimal \nnumber of LTC switching. \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nControl processes\n79\nReferences\n1.
