I NTRODUCTION\nT\nHE high-voltage direct current technology is rapidly de-\nveloping for large-scale power transmission systems [1]–\n[4]. This highly involves deployments of modular multilevel\nconverters (MMCs) [5]–[9], which are also used for industrial\ndrive systems at the medium voltage level [10]–[12]. Although\nmost of the existing dc systems are using the point-to-point con-\nnected MMCs, there is a growing demand on the evolution to\nthe dc grids. A key technical challenge that has to be faced is\nthe implementation of dc transformers used for voltage-level\nchanges. Developing low-cost, high-efﬁciency dc transformers\nrequires proper arrangement to customize. Conventional MMC\ntechnologies in the applications of dc–ac conversion cannot be\nused straightforwardly for dc transformation.

To accomplish low step ratio dc–dc conversion,\nthe topologies can be classiﬁed into two different groups accord-\ning to the arrangement of the stacks: front-to-front [17]–[19]\nand direct chain link [20]–[23]. The former architecture, which\ntypically involves two MMCs with coupled ac sides, can be im-\nplemented with existing technologies. However, the conversion\nonly transfers the power of one unit using two MMCs, leading to\na high cost and huge losses for a low step ratio dc–dc conversion.\nThe latter, with only one chain link required, takes less footprint\nand can be more efﬁcient in principle [22]. However, the control\nof chain-link converters is complicated and challenging [23],\n[24], and the step-up conversion is severely constrained by the\nimpedance of the passive components in the circuit. Hence,\nsuch chain-link conﬁguration has not been seen implemented\nfor step-up dc–dc conversion so far. Technical development on\nthe topology and control of chain-link dc–dc converters will\nmake contribution to bridge the gap between the state-of-the-art\nconcept and the emerging application requirement.\nIn order to explore the dc transformation approach based on\nchain-link converters, this paper studies a low step-up ratio dc\ntransformer topology without using isolation transformer. The\nconverter is arranged with chain-link half-bridge submodules\n(SMs), being able to achieve a step-up ratio range meeting ma-\njor requirements. The chain links have only one function, which\nprovide a push–pull power to the output rectiﬁer. The proposed\nconverter is operated in a resonant mode for the step-up dc–\ndc conversion with soft switching. The converter topology de-\nscribed in this paper is monopolar but it can also be reconﬁgured\nfor the bipolar conversion. The step-up ratio ranges mainly ac-\ncording to the modulation scheme. Owning to the resonant op-\neration, the converter step-up ratio can also be regulated by the\noperating frequency. With appropriate modulation methods, the\nSM capacitor voltages of the converter can be balanced without\nusing additional balancing control. The analysis of the step-up\nconversion operating in the resonant mode is veriﬁed by the\nrelevant experimental results.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

L OW STEP-UP RAT I OCHAIN-LINK DC–DC C ONVERTER\nThis section presents the circuit conﬁguration of the proposed\nlow step-up ratio chain-link dc–dc converter. The operation\nprinciple is analyzed and the general transformation feature is\nprovided.\nA. Circuit Topology of Monopolar Low Step-Up Ratio\nDC Transformer\nThe circuit topology of the low step-up ratio dc–dc converter\nwith two chain links is shown in Fig. 1. Bipolar arrangement can\nbe accomplished by connecting another monopolar converter\nconﬁgured with negative polarity. The converter is bilaterally\nsymmetrical. It consists of two stacks each with N half-bridge\nsubmodules, autotransformers Ta and T′\na with the step ratio of\nγT , series impedance Ls and Cs (L′\ns and C′\ns), and an output\nrectiﬁer with a virtual capacitor Co seen on the terminal (equal\nto series capacitance on high-voltage side and low-voltage side).\nThe rectiﬁer may contain several components in series, depend-\ning on the rectiﬁer voltage level. Deployment of thyristors can\nrealize forward blocking, but in normal situations the operation\nwould not differ from that of diodes. The SM capacitors on\nthe left-hand side and right-hand side are denoted by C\nj and\nC′\nj (j =1 ,2,...,N ), respectively. The capacitor voltage and\noutput voltage of the jth submodule are represented by vCj (or\nv′\nCj ) and vj (or v′\nj ), respectively. The voltage across the stack\nand autotransformer are represented by vs (or v′\ns) and va (or\nv′\na), respectively. The low-voltage dc and high-voltage dc are\nrepresented by vL and vH , respectively. The ﬁnal high dc voltage\nFig. 2. Simpliﬁed circuit diagram of the proposed converter.\nvH is obtained by the dc voltage vo rectiﬁed from the push–pull\nstack output plus vL . The function of the chain link is to gener-\nate an ac voltage, which enables the converter to be operated in\nvarious ways.\nB. Operation Principle of the Proposed Low Step-Up\nRatio Converter\nTo analyze the operation principle, the circuit topology in\nFig. 1 is simpliﬁed to the diagram shown in Fig. 2 . The con-\nverter operation presented in Fig. 2 is based on the following\nassumptions.\n1) The parameters in the symmetric positions are the same.\n2) The large inductors L and L\n′representing autotransform-\ners completely block the ac current ﬂowing through.\n3) The impedances Z and Z′ have inﬁnite dc resistance but\nnegligible ac impedance at the operating frequency.\nThe stacks with half-bridge SMs in the converter are operated\nto generate square wave voltages vs and v′\ns. The dc components\nof vs and v′\ns are assumed to be the same. The ac components of\nvs and v′\ns have a modulation index of m and a 180◦ phase delay\nto each other. Therefore, a push–pull output with the equivalent\noperating frequency of feq is generated by the stacks, which is\nwritten as follows:\n[\nvs\nv′\ns\n]\n=\n[\n1 −sgn (sin2πfeqt)\n1 +sgn (sin2 πfeqt)\n][\nvL\nmvL\n]\n. (1)\nThis ac voltage difference between the two stacks is further\nampliﬁed by the autotransformer, yielding\n[ va\nv′\na\n]\n= −\n[ γT 0\n0 γT\n][ vs\nv′\ns\n]\n+\n[ γT\nγT\n]\nvL . (2)\nThe voltage difference between va and v′\na is applied to the\nrectiﬁer with the impedance networks in series, which is derived\nZHANG et al.: PUSH–PULL MODULAR-MULTILEVEL-CONVERTER-BASED LOW STEP-UP RATIO DC T RANSFORMER 2249\nas follows:\nva − v′\na =2 mγT vL · sgn (sin2πfeqt) . (3)\nFor a square wave rectiﬁer input voltage vt with fre-\nquency matching the resonant frequency, its rectiﬁed output is\napproximated by\nv\no =2 mγT vL . (4)\nThe rectiﬁed voltage vo in series with the low dc voltage vL\nforms the high dc voltage vH . The converter step ratio is deﬁned\nas γ = vH /vL .\nDuring the step-up operation, the current ﬂow can be observed\nin Fig. 2. The ac current generated from the stacks ﬂows in a big\ncircle. As the impedance network has negligible ac impedance\nat the operating frequency, when the ac current ﬂows through\nthe impedance network, the ac voltage across the network is\nsmall. Hence, the output voltage vo is determined mainly by the\nstack ac voltage.\nThe step-up converter behaves as a voltage controlled con-\nverter. The current IH is determined by vH and the load R.I ft h e\nconverter is lossless, the stack currents can be written as follows:\n{\nIdc = I′\ndc =( γ − 1)IH /2\nIac = I′\nac = IH\n. (5)\nUsually, the switch voltage rating requires at least 1.5 times\nof the cell voltage vC . The maximum step-up ratio from the low\ndc voltage to the high dc voltage is\nγ =1+2 mγT . (6)\nFor an ordinary stack, there is 0 <m< 1. The step-up ratio\nrange is written as follows:\n1 <γ< 1+2 γT . (7)\nHowever, the actual step ratio is usually lower than the max-\nimum value to leave a margin for regulation of the high dc\nvoltage. The converter works as a low step-up ratio dc trans-\nformer. The ratio is also determined by the modulation method\nand the control scheme.\nIII. DC T\nRANSFORMA TIONOPERA TING IN A\nRESONANT MODE\nThis section demonstrates the modulation method of the con-\nverter in a resonant mode. The resonant mode is one of the op-\neration modes. It can reﬂect the converter performance with soft\nswitching and verify the feasibility of the step-up conversion.\nA. Low Step-Up Ratio DC Transformer Operated in the\nResonant Conversion Mode\nThe actual step ratio is dependent on the push–pull stack\nvoltage output. Modulation and control of the stacks can deter-\nmine the operation mode of the converter, achieving a ﬂexible\nstep-up ratio. Although many control schemes can be used, this\npaper demonstrates the resonant mode to explain the operation\nprinciple of the step-up conversion.\nThe switching of SMs determines the number of SM\ncapacitors in series and the total voltage across the stacks. In\nresonant operation mode, the converter generates square wave\nT ABLE I\nSM C AP ACITORDEPLOYMENT FOR THE RESONANT OPERA TIONWITH\nX = 5 AND Y =1\nvoltages vs and v′\ns. This is obtained by changing the numbers of\nSM capacitors in series. To achieve a higher dc voltage vH ,t h e\namplitude of the square wave voltage should be high. Taking\nN = 5 as an example, there are ﬁve cells in the left stack and\nﬁve in the right. The highest square wave voltage amplitude\ncan be obtained by using the modulation method in Table I.\nThis modulation method results in ten switching states of the\nconverter. Each state lasts for an equal time span. In State 1,\nall the SM capacitors of the left stack are deployed in series to\nparticipate the resonant operation. However, only the ﬁrst SM\ncapacitor of the right stack is deployed. In the last state, only\nC\n5 of the left stack is deployed but all the SM capacitors of the\nright stack are inserted. After all the states in Table I, the stacks\nenter the ﬁrst state again and repeat this modulation table.\nIt can be seen that at any time the ac current ﬂows through ﬁve\ncapacitors in one stack but ﬂows through one capacitor in the\nother stack. The number with more capacitors that the ac current\nﬂowing through is deﬁned as X, whereas the number with fewer\ncapacitors that the ac current ﬂowing through is deﬁned as Y .\nIn the operation mode of Table I, X =5 and Y =1 .\nThe voltage across the large inductor pair is vs − v′\ns.I fa l l\nthe SM capacitor voltages are the same, in each state of Table I,\nthe voltage vs − v′\ns is equal to either 4vC or −4vC . Therefore,\nassuming that the step ratio of autotransformers is γT =1 ,t h e\npeak voltage of the square wave across the large inductor pair\nis 4vC .\nOn the other hand, each stack voltage steps between vC and\n5vC , yielding an average stack dc voltage of 3vC = vL .A sa\nresult, the peak voltage of the square wave across the large induc-\ntor pair is 4v\nL /3. If the square wave has a frequency matching\nthe resonant frequency of the impedance network, the step-up\nratio is γ =7 /3.\nThe resonant operation can also obtain a lower dc voltage\nvH . This can be achieved by modifying the arrangement of\nthe SM capacitors in series deployment. Using the modulation\nmethod in Table II, the stack voltage steps between 2\nvC and 5vC .\nOwning to the page limit, the detailed analysis is not presented\nhere. At the resonant frequency, the step-up ratio is γ =1 3 /7.\nAn even lower dc voltage vH can be obtained with the modu-\nlation method in Table III. The stack voltage steps between 3vC\nand 5vC . The average stack dc voltage is equal to 4vC .A tt h e\nresonant frequency, the step-up ratio is γ =3 /2.\nThe smallest step-up ratio in the resonant mode is achieved\nby generating a low-amplitude square wave voltage push–pull\n2250 IEEE T RANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 66, NO. 3, MARCH 2019\nT ABLE II\nSM C AP ACITORDEPLOYMENT FOR RESONANT OPERA TIONWITH X =5\nAND Y =2\nT ABLE III\nSM C AP ACITORDEPLOYMENT FOR RESONANT OPERA TIONWITH X =5\nAND Y =3\nT ABLE IV\nSM C AP ACITORDEPLOYMENT FOR RESONANT OPERA TIONWITH X =5\nAND Y =4\noutput, with the modulation method is shown in Table IV.T h e\nvoltage vs − v′\ns is equal to either vC or −vC . Therefore, with\nthe modulation method in Table IV , the peak voltage of the\nsquare wave across the large inductor pair is vC . On the other\nhand, the average stack dc voltage is 4.5vC , which is equal to\nvL . As a result, the peak voltage of the square wave across the\nlarge inductor pair is 2vL /9. If the square wave has a frequency\nmatching the resonant frequency of the impedance network, the\nstep-up ratio is γ =1 1 /9.\nIn general, the step-up ratio can be calculated based on the\nnumbers of SM capacitors deployed in series resonant operation.\nIn a resonant state, if one stack has X capacitors inserted in series\nand the other has Y capacitors inserted in series ( X>Y ), the\naverage SM voltage is written as follows:\nvC = 2vL\nX + Y . (8)\nFig. 3. Time domain key waveforms of the converter.\nThe rectiﬁed voltage is equal to the peak voltage of va − v′\na,\nyielding\nvC = 1\nγT\nvo\nX − Y . (9)\nSubstituting (9) into (8), the step-up ratio of the converter at\nthe resonant frequency is\nγ =1+2 γT\nX − Y\nX + Y . (10)\nV ariations on the combination of X and Y achieve a ﬂexible\nstep-up ratio. However, owing to the page limit, the other modu-\nlation methods in the resonant mode are not explained in detail.\nRegardless of the amplitude of the square wave voltage across\nthe large inductor pair, the key voltage and current waveforms of\nthe converter in different conduction modes are shown in Fig. 3.\nFig. 3 shows the key waveforms of the converter with the\nequivalent operating frequency slightly higher than the resonant\nfrequency of the impedance network. The two sides have sym-\nmetric operations. The ﬁrst-half cycle starts with v\nt = vo, where\nthe stack current is and parallel the current ip are overlapped.\nThe stack current is resonates until the rectiﬁer input voltage is\nreversed to negative. At that instant, the commutation of the rec-\ntiﬁer current forces the stack current to overlap with the parallel\ncurrent immediately. In the second half-cycle, the input voltage\nof the rectiﬁer becomes negative, with is resonating to its nega-\ntive peak. The stack current is ﬁnally overlaps with the parallel\ncurrent ip when the rectiﬁer input voltage is reversed to positive.\nDuring this equivalent operating cycle, the rectiﬁer voltage is a\ncomplete square wave. The rectiﬁer current i\nt is sinusoidal and\nkeeps the same phase with the rectiﬁer voltage, supplying a con-\nstant resonant power to the output. Meanwhile, the dc energy\ndeviation and ac energy deviation of each stack keeps a zero\nsum, satisfying the stack power balancing condition.\nB. Inherent Balancing of SM Capacitor Voltages\nThe inherent balancing ability is an attractive feature of the\nresonant conversion mode. With inherent balancing, there is no\nneed to use additional balancing control. The balancing abil-\nity is mainly determined by the modulation method. For the\nZHANG et al.: PUSH–PULL MODULAR-MULTILEVEL-CONVERTER-BASED LOW STEP-UP RATIO DC T RANSFORMER 2251\nmodulation method in Table I (X =5 , Y =1 ), each state cor-\nresponds to an equation following the voltage law in the circuit,\nwhich can be written as follows:\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nA5,1 05×5 15×1\n05×5 A5,1 15×1\n11×5 01×5 −1\n⎤\n⎥⎦\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nvC\nv′\nC\n1\n2 vo\n⎤\n⎥⎦ =\n⎡\n⎢⎣\n15×1\n15×1\n1\n⎤\n⎥⎦ vL (11)\nwith\nA5,1 =\n⎡\n⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢⎣\n10000\n01000\n00100\n00010\n00001\n⎤\n⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥⎦\nv\nC =\n⎡\n⎢⎢\n⎢⎢⎣\nv\nC 1\nvC 2\nvC 3\nvC 4\nvC 5\n⎤\n⎥⎥\n⎥⎥⎦\n, and v\n′\nC =\n⎡\n⎢⎢\n⎢\n⎢⎢⎣\nv\n′\nC 1\nv′\nC 2\nv′\nC 3\nv′\nC 4\nv′\nC 5\n⎤\n⎥⎥\n⎥\n⎥⎥⎦\n.\nIt can be calculated that the equation set of (11) has a unique\nsolution. Each SM capacitor voltage equals to v\no/4 and is\nclamped by the voltage on the output capacitor. Hence, un-\nder this operation mode, the SM capacitor voltages are well\nbalanced.\nThe SM capacitor voltages in the operation mode with the\nmodulation method in Table II (X =5 , Y =2 ) can be described\nas follows:\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nA\n5,2 05×5 15×1\n05×5 A5,2 15×1\n11×5 01×5 −1\n⎤\n⎥⎦\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nvC\nv′\nC\n1\n2 vo\n⎤\n⎥⎦ =\n⎡\n⎢⎣\n15×1\n15×1\n1\n⎤\n⎥⎦ vL (12)\nwith\nA5,2 =\n⎡\n⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣\n11000\n01100\n00110\n00011\n10001\n⎤\n⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦\n.\nThe equation set of (12) also has a unique solution. Each\nSM capacitor has a voltage equal to v\no/3. Under this operation\nmode, the SM capacitor voltages are balanced as well.\nThe operation mode achieved by the modulation scheme in\nTable III (X =5 , Y =3 ) can be described by the equation set\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nA5,3 05×5 15×1\n05×5 A5,3 15×1\n11×5 01×5 −1\n⎤\n⎥⎦\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nvC\nv′\nC\n1\n2 vo\n⎤\n⎥⎦ =\n⎡\n⎢⎣\n15×1\n15×1\n1\n⎤\n⎥⎦ vL (13)\nwith\nA5,3 =\n⎡\n⎢⎢\n⎢⎢⎣\n11100\n01110\n00111\n10011\n11001\n⎤\n⎥⎥\n⎥⎥⎦\n.\nT ABLE V\nCOMP ARISON OF THE TWO CONVERTER SCHEMS\nThis operation mode gives a unique solution of the SM ca-\npacitor voltages. The solution can be obtained from (13) and the\nSM capacitor voltages are balanced.\nThe operation mode with the lowest step-up ratio correspond-\ning to the modulation method in Table IV (X =5 , Y =4 )i s\nalso studied. In this mode the capacitor voltages follow the\nequation set\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nA\n5,4 05×5 15×1\n05×5 A5,4 15×1\n11×5 01×5 −1\n⎤\n⎥⎦\n⎡\n⎢⎣\nvC\nv′\nC\n1\n2 vo\n⎤\n⎥⎦ =\n⎡\n⎢⎣\n15×1\n15×1\n1\n⎤\n⎥⎦ vL (14)\nwith\nA5,4 =\n⎡\n⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣\n01111\n10111\n11011\n11101\n11110\n⎤\n⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦\n.\nIt can be calculated that the equation set of (14) has a unique\nsolution, and the SM capacitor voltages are inherently balanced.\nIn the equation sets of (11)–(14), each matrix on the left-hand\nside has full rank. Therefore, the solution should be unique and\nthe inherent balancing of the SM capacitor voltages is guaran-\nteed. Also, with X = 5, under all circumstances of an arbitrary\nY , the matrices on the left-hand side of the equation set have full\nrank. However, a full rank matrix is not always guaranteed when\nX varies. Therefore, the numbers X and Y should be carefully\nchosen. The balancing ability will be presented and veriﬁed in\nthe next section.\nC. Comparison and Analysis on Low Step\nRatio Application\nThe proposed converter is compared to the modular mul-\ntilevel dc–dc converter (MMDC) [24] without the center tap\nfull bridges taken into consideration for cost and losses study.\nOnly one leg (A1 and A2) is used in the MMDC. The step-\nup conversion is from 25 to 30 kV with 10-MW power\ntransmitted. The proposed converter has nine cells on both\nleft- and right-hand sides. The Inﬁneon insulated-gate bipo-\nlar transistor (IGBT) modules FZ1200R45HL3 and diodes\nDD1200S45KL3\nB5 are used as half bridges and rectiﬁers, re-\nspectively. The modulation method of X =9 and Y =7 is\nused. On the other hand, the MMDC [24] is comprised of\nnine cells on the top arm and nine cells on the bottom arm.\nThe numbers of the half bridges used in the two schemes\nare the same. The switching frequency is 400 Hz. A list\nfor comparison of the two converter schemes are shown in\nTable V.\n2252 IEEE T RANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 66, NO. 3, MARCH 2019\nT ABLE VI\nEXPERIMENT ALPARAMETERS\nIt can be seen from Table V that the MMDC scheme has\nhigh-voltage stress in half bridges. Switch devices with series\nconnection may be required. This is because in the modulation\nmethod of MMDC, the sum of the capacitor voltages is equal to\ntwice the dc-side voltage. However, using the proper modulation\nmethod in the proposed scheme, the voltage stress can be much\nlower according to (8), namely 3.1 kV in average. The MMDC\nmay win in control ﬂexibility, but the proposed converter has a\nhybrid topology of half-bridge modules and a rectiﬁer. In the\napplication with step-up ratio close to unit, the cost is saved\nby using rectiﬁer rather than submodules. Moreover, owning\nto the soft switching of the resonant operation, the proposed\nconverter also has lower switching losses. The SM capacitors\nare inherently balanced. Hence, although the proposed converter\ncan achieve ranged step ratio, it has more beneﬁts on cost and\nefﬁciency in lower step-up ratio applications. The test results\nwill be demonstrated in the next section.\nIV . E\nXPERIMENT ALRESULTS\nA downscaled experimental prototype with ten submodules\nwas built to demonstrate the operation of the converter in Fig 1.\nEach submodule is comprised of an Inﬁneon IGBT module\nFF225R12ME4 and a 550- μF capacitor. A digital signal pro-\ncessor TMS320F28335 from Texas Instruments was deployed\nto control the converter. Large inductors are placed between the\nlow dc voltage and the stacks, representing an autotransformer\nwith the unit step ratio. Two sets of series inductors and series\ncapacitors were placed between the large inductors and the rec-\ntiﬁer. A ﬁxed resistive load was connected at the high-voltage\ndc side. Apart from the cell capacitor rated more than 800 V , the\nseries capacitors and the output capacitors have a voltage rating\nof 700 V . All the inductors have the same current rating of 14 A.\nThe rectiﬁer has a voltage rating of 600 V and current rating\nof 30 A. The test setup is presented in Fig. 4 and the detailed\ncircuit parameters are listed in Table VI.\nA. Resonant Conversion for Low Step-Up\nRatio Operation\nTo verify the operation principle, the converter operated in\nthe resonant conversion mode is demonstrated. Due to the\npage limit, the experimental results using the modulation with\nX = 5 and Y =1 and the modulation with X = 5 and Y = 4\nare presented.\nFor converter with relatively high step-up ratio, the modula-\ntion method with X = 5 and Y = 1i su s e d( s e eTable I). In this\ncase, the input voltage is 150 V and the operating frequency is\nFig. 4. T est setup of the step-up converter.\n2 kHz. The converter voltage and current waveforms are shown\nin Fig. 5 .\nFig. 5(a) shows that the converter high dc voltage is almost\na constant with the average value of 350 V . The rectiﬁer input\nvoltage vt is a complete square wave with the peak value of\n200 V , which is also equal to the voltage on the output capacitor.\nThe rectiﬁer currents it and i′\nt have same amplitude but with\na phase difference of 180 ◦. The stack voltages vs and v′\ns in\nFig. 5(b) are square wave with dc offsets. They range from 50 to\n250 V . As a result, the difference between vs and v′\ns is a square\nwave with the peak voltage of 200 V . This result is in accordance\nwith vt measured in Fig. 5(a) . The stack currents is and i′\ns in\nFig. 5(b) consist of dc components and ac components. The dc\ncurrent components with the stack dc voltages provide the dc\npower. This dc power is balanced with the ac power contributed\nby the stack ac currents and the stack ac voltages, guaranteeing\na balanced power on the submodules.\nThe experimental waveforms of the rectiﬁer input voltage v\nt,\nstack current is, and parallel current ip are shown in Fig. 6(a) .\nThe large inductor current ip is a triangle wave and overlaps\nwith is when vt is reversed. The stack current is equals to it\nplus ip. Moreover, the voltage of the upper switch of SM 1 vSW1\nand the current of that switch iSW1 are measured and shown\nin Fig. 6(b) . It can be seen that each upper switch achieves\nzero voltage switching (ZVS). The lower switch also achieves\nZVS. Because the current is not approachable, the waveforms of\nthe lower switch are not shown. The experimentally measured\nefﬁciency of the conversion is 97.7%.\nZHANG et al.: PUSH–PULL MODULAR-MULTILEVEL-CONVERTER-BASED LOW STEP-UP RATIO DC T RANSFORMER 2253\nFig. 5.

(a) High-dc voltage, rectiﬁer voltage, and\ncurrents. (b) Stack voltages and currents.\nWith the modulation of X =5 and Y =4 (see Table II), the\nconverter achieves a very low step ratio. In the test, the input\nlow dc voltage is 300 V , and the equivalent operating frequency\nis 2 kHz. The key waveforms are shown in Fig. 7 .\nFig. 7(a) shows that the converter high dc voltage is 350 V .\nThe rectiﬁer input voltage vt is a complete square wave with\nthe peak value of 50 V . The voltage on the output capacitor is\nalso 50 V . The rectiﬁer currents it and i′\nt have a phase difference\nof 180 ◦. The stack voltages vs and v′\ns in Fig. 7(b) are square\nwave with small ac amplitude but high dc offsets. On the other\nhand, the stack currents is and i′\ns in Fig. 7(b) consist of small dc\ncomponents and high ac components. This is because that the\npower transmitted to the rectiﬁer is small with this modulation\nmethod. Most of the power is transmitted by the dc current via\nthe rectiﬁer from the input. As a result, the dc power and ac\npower on the stacks are relatively low.\nThe experimental waveforms of the rectiﬁer input voltage v\nt,\nstack current is, and parallel current ip are shown in Fig. 8(a) .\nThe large inductor current ip is a triangle wave. The stack current\nis equals to it plus ip. Moreover, the voltage of upper switch of\nSM 1 vSW1 and the current of that switch iSW1 are measured and\nshown in Fig. 8(b). Although the equivalent operating frequency\nis 2 kHz, the switching frequency is only 400 Hz. All switches\nachieve ZVS in this operation mode. The conversion achieves a\nmeasured efﬁciency of 99.3% in the test.\nIn the experimental result of the lowest step-up ratio, the con-\nverter has the equivalent operating frequency, which is exactly\nﬁve times of the switching frequency in each cell. This gives\nthe advantage on the size reduction of passive components. If\nthe switching frequency increases, further reduction on passive\ncomponents can apply. Moreover, the converter operating in a\nlow step-up ratio resonant mode with soft switching achieves\nhigh conversion efﬁciency. The modular structure also achieves\nthe scalability of a converter with the increased voltage level.\nThis gives feasibility of the converter in even high-voltage appli-\ncations. In the application of dc grid, this converter can be used\n2254 IEEE T RANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 66, NO. 3, MARCH 2019\nFig. 8.

Measured output voltage versus input voltage under different\nmodulation schemes with feq = 2k H z .\nas a dc transformer for interconnection with different voltage\nlevels.\nThe SM capacitor voltages in the left stack and right stack\nare measured and listed in Table VII. It can be seen that under\nall operation modes with X = 5, the SM capacitor voltages are\nbalanced completely. This result validates the conclusion in the\nprevious analysis.\nB. Step-Up DC Transformer\nThe step-up conversion were experimentally veriﬁed by mea-\nsuring the converter output voltage versus the input voltage. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 9 , which demonstrate a good linearity\nunder different modulation schemes. The measured results are\nin good accordance with the theoretic values.\nFig. 10. Performance of dc transformation with X = 5.\nThe step-up ratio is also measured with different operating\nfrequencies. If the frequency of the square wave voltage in (3)\nvaries, the step-up ratio is slightly changed. The results are\npresented in Fig. 10 . It can be observed that regardless of the\nequivalent operating frequency, the step-up conversion guaran-\ntees a good linearity. Moreover, from the resonant frequency of\n2 kHz, when the operating frequency increases, the step-up ra-\ntio decreases. The deviation of the operating frequency from the\nresonant frequency leads to a reduced voltage gain. This feature\ncan be used to regulate the step-up ratio, yielding an adjustable\nconversion range.\nV. C\nONCLUSION\nThis paper presented a chain-link converter for low step-\nup ratio dc–dc conversion. The converter was transformerless\nand modular. The dc components of the stack voltages were\nZHANG et al.: PUSH–PULL MODULAR-MULTILEVEL-CONVERTER-BASED LOW STEP-UP RATIO DC T RANSFORMER 2255\nwithstanding the low dc voltage. The ac components of the\nstack voltages were rectiﬁed to generate a dc voltage surplus.\nThe converter had only one pair of push–pull chain link sub-\nmodules to achieve ﬂexible step ratio. The converter can be\noperated in a resonant mode, featured with the zero voltage soft\nswitching. The converter performs efﬁcient low step-up ratio\ndc–dc conversion. The step-up ratio depends on the modulation\nand operating frequency. Moreover, under different modulation\nmethods, the converter behaves as a dc transformer with a good\nlinearity and guarantees the inherent balancing ability. The anal-\nysis was ﬁnally validated by the measured results retrieved from\na downscaled experimental prototype.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] M. Hajian, J. Robinson, D. Jovcic, and B.
