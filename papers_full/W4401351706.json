  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate and compare the abilities of Language Models (LLMs) in simplifying Turkish ultrasound (US) findings for patients. Methods: We assessed the simplification performance of four LLMs: ChatGPT 4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus, and Perplexity, using fifty fictional Turkish US findings. Comparison was based on Ateşman’s Readability Index and word count. Three radiologists rated medical accuracy, consistency, and comprehensibility on a Likert scale from 1 to 5. Statistical tests (Friedman, Wilcoxon, and Spearman correlation) examined differences in LLMs' performance. Results: Gemini 1.5 Pro, ChatGPT-4, and Claude 3 Opus received high Likert scores for medical accuracy, consistency, and comprehensibility (mean: 4.7–4.8). Perplexity scored significantly lower (mean: 4.1, p&lt;0.001). Gemini 1.5 Pro achieved the highest readability score (mean: 61.16), followed by ChatGPT-4 (mean: 58.94) and Claude 3 Opus (mean: 51.16). Perplexity had the lowest readability score (mean: 47.01). Gemini 1.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4 used significantly more words compared to Claude 3 Opus and Perplexity (p&lt;0.001). Linear correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between word count of fictional US findings and responses generated by Gemini 1.5 Pro (correlation coefficient = 0.38, p&lt;0.05) and ChatGPT-4 (correlation coefficient = 0.43, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: This study highlights strong potential of LLMs in simplifying Turkish US findings, improving accessibility and clarity for patients. Gemini 1.5 Pro, ChatGPT-4, and Claude 3 Opus performed well, highlighting their effectiveness in healthcare communication. Further research is required to fully understand the integration of LLMs into clinical practice and their influence on patient comprehension and decision-making.",
