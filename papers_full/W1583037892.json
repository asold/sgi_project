  "full_text": "An ultra-thin waveguide twist constructed using ﬁsh-scale metallic wires\nJin Han,1, 2 Hongqiang Li,1, 2,a) Yuancheng Fan,1, 2 Zeyong Wei,1, 2 Chao Wu,1, 2 Yang Cao,1, 2 Xing Yu,1, 2 Fang\nLi,1, 2 and Zhanshan Wang1, 2\n1)Department of Physics, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, People’s Republic of China\n2)Shanghai Key Laboratory of Special Artiﬁcal Microstructure Materials and Technology, Shanghai,\nPeople’s Republic of China\nThis study theoretically and experimentally investigates the transmission properties of a metamaterial slab\ncomprised of two layers of metallic ﬁsh-scale structure arrays and a sandwiched dielectric layer. Calculations\nshow that the asymmetric transmission can be tuned by varying the slab thickness, due to evanescent interlayer\ncoupling. The spatial evolution of the local ﬁeld inside the structure indicates that the slab functions as\na perfect polarization transformer at certain frequencies in the manner of a waveguide twist. Measured\ntransmission spectra are in good agreement with calculated results when material dissipation is considered.\nRecently, considerable interests in the asymmetric\ntransmission (AT) of polarized light has been revived in\nthe context of planar chiral metamaterials 1–8.This phe-\nnomenon, arising from the vector nature of electromag-\nnetic waves, still satisﬁes the de Hoop reciprocity as re-\nvealed by Jones and Muller matrix formulation 9. That\nis, in the transfer-matrix representation of an optical sys-\ntem, the matrix for reverse transmission is the transpose\nof that of forward transmission. The system will give\nrise to asymmetric transmission of polarized light pro-\nvided that the system is chiral and anistropic 7. The\nmetamaterial approach1–9 enables this functionality to be\nimplemented at subwavelength thicknesses. These ﬁnd-\nings constitute an alternative solution for one-way elec-\ntromagnetic isolator and related devices to the scheme\nrelying on nonreciprocal ingredients such as gyrotropy10,\nor nonlinearity11et al.\nIt is notable that the coupling among the metallic\nbuilding blocks or meta-atoms is instrumental for the ex-\notic properties of the metamaterial. A microscopic in-\nvestigation is helpful for deeper insight into the under-\nlying physics as well as for practical applications. Fish-\nscale metallic wire 12, taken as a typical example of a\nplanar chiral metamaterial, has been investigated exten-\nsively as an optical magnetic mirror 13 and local ﬁeld\nconcentrator14. In this paper, we propose a device for\nasymmetric transmission that is composed of two lay-\ners of ﬁsh-scale structure metallic wires in an orthogonal\narrangement and a sandwiched dielectric spacer layer.\nCalculation of the local ﬁeld distribution reveals that the\nthin slab functions as a waveguide twist 15,16, giving rise\nto nearly perfect asymmetric transmission. This physical\npicture uniﬁes mode matching at the entrance interface\nand polarization transformation inside the slab to explain\nthe formation of AT and its dependence on slab thickness.\nA unit cell of our model slab, shown in front view and\nstereogram in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b), is composed of\ncircularly meandering and straight metallic strips. The\nmetallic patterns on the front and back surfaces of the\ndielectric layer are the same, but are rotated relative to\na)Electronic mail: hqlee@tongji.edu.cn\neach other at an angle of 90 0 about the z axis. The\ngeometric parameters marked in Fig. 1(a) are the width\nw= 1.4mm of the metallic strips, the radii r1 = 3.05mm,\nr2 = 4.45mm of the inner and outer circles, the length\na= 4.8mm of the straight metallic strip, and period p=\n15mm of a square unit cell. The substrate has a thickness\nof t = 1 .8mm. Fig. 1(c) shows a photo of our sample\nwith the same geometric parameters as the theoretical\nmodel in Fig. 1(a). The metallic ﬁsh-scale patterns are\nfabricated and deposited on the 35 µm-thick copper foils\non both sides of an FR4 dielectric substrate. The lateral\nsize of the entire sample slab is 570 ×435mm.\nWe perform ﬁnite-diﬀerence-in-time-domain (FDTD)\nnumerical simulations to calculate the transmission spec-\ntra of our ﬁsh-scale model for x-polarized and y-polarized\nincident waves along the +z and −z directions. For sim-\nplicity, metals are assumed to be perfect electric conduc-\ntors (PECs). The dielectric substrate is assumed to be\nlossless, with a permittivity ϵr ≈4.1, the same as that\nof the FR4 substrate. The transmission coeﬃcient Td\nij is\ndeﬁned in terms of the intensity of the electric ﬁeld, with\nthe ﬁrst and the second subscripts denoting the polarized\nstates of the incident wave and transmitted wave compo-\nnents, respectively, and the superscript d = +/−refer-\nring to forward(+) or backward( −) transmission. For\nexample, T+\nxy denotes the normalized intensity of the y-\npolarized transmitted wave component( ⃗E ∥⃗ y) with re-\nspect to the x-polarized( ⃗E ∥⃗ x) incident wave along the\nforward direction (kz>0 and k∥=0), and the total trans-\nmissivity (for all polarizations) is given by |T+\nxx + T+\nxy |.\nFIG. 1. a schematic of (a)the front view (in x −y plane) of\nthe sample slab, (b)the stereogram of a unit cell, (c)a photo of\nour sample. The thickness of the dielectric layer is t =1.8mm.\narXiv:1101.2788v2  [physics.optics]  31 May 2011\n2\nFig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) presents the forward and back-\nward transmission spectra T+ and T−of our model slab\ncalculated by the FDTD algorithm. We see, both in Fig.\n2(a) and Fig. 2(b) that Txx is nearly superposed onto\nTyy. This is because the structure, taken as a whole,\nis essentially isotropic, due to the orthogonal alignment\nof the ﬁsh-scale patterns on both sides of the dielectric\nlayer. However, a salient feature in Fig. 2(a) and Fig.\n2(b) is that Txy is markedly diﬀerent from Tyx at all\nfrequencies. Txy and Tyx are interchanged when the inci-\ndent direction (wavevector ⃗k) is reversed, giving rise to a\nclear signature of asymmetric transmission. A maximum\nof 97% transmission is reached at 8 .7GHz in the spec-\ntrum of T+\nxy; meanwhile, both T+\nyx and T+\nxx are below 1%\ntransmission near 8.7GHz.\nThe asymmetric property described above has close\nconnections with the transmission spectra of a monolayer\nof ﬁsh-scale metallic wires. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the\nmonolayer with y-oriented wires is transparent to the y-\npolarized incident wave ( Tyy>60%) around 8 .7GHz but\nopaque to the x-polarized incident wave ( Txx<10%) at\nthe same frequencies. This is because there exists a lo-\ncal mode owned by the x/y-oriented ﬁsh-scale structure\nthat only couples to x/y-polarized plane waves near the\nfrequency 8.7GHz12. In the case presented in Fig. 2(a),\nan x-polarized incident wave at approximately 8.7GHz in\nthe forward direction will meet the x-oriented ﬁsh-scale\npatterns ﬁrst, so that it can propagate inside the slab\nand be transformed into y-polarization afterwards. In\ncontrast, an y-polarized incidence at the same frequency\ncan not couple with the local mode based on the metallic\nlayer at the entrance. Similar rules also apply to a back-\nward incident wave along the −z direction, as seen by\ninterchanging x and y subscripts (see Fig. 2(b)). How-\never, asymmetric transmission with high bandwidth, as\nshown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b), can not be deduced\nFIG. 2. Calculated transmission spectra for x-polarized\n( ⃗E ∥⃗ x) and y polarized ( ⃗E ∥⃗ y) incidence of our sample slab\n(a)along +z direction and (b) along −z direction.

The spectra of backward transmission for diﬀerent\nslab thicknesses t.\nfrom the transmission properties of a monolayer of ﬁsh-\nscale metallic patterns (Fig. 2(c)). The coupling between\nthe metallic layers must be considered for a complete de-\nscription of theses phenomena.\nFig. 3 presents the calculated transmission spectra\nT−\nyx, T−\nxy and T−\nxx with respect to the diﬀerent thick-\nnesses t= 1.8mm, 3mm, 6mm and 20mm of the dielectric\nlayer. We see from Fig. 3(a) that, T−\nyx varies rapidly in\nlineshape as a function of slab thickness t. When t is\nsmall, both T−\nxx and T−\nxy are suppressed very well at a\nlevel of 10 −2 −10−3, within the 7 .5−10GHz range, giv-\ning rise to an AT functionality with good performance.\nAt t= 6mm, the AT below 10GHz disappears. However,\nAT is observed along the reverse direction near 10 .5GHz\nwhere T−\nxy reaches its maximum of 0.46, and|T−\nyx +T−\nxx|≈\n0.027 is still very small. This means that the asymmetric\ntransmission can be tuned to a diﬀerent frequency even\nalong the reversed direction, by changing the thickness\nt. For much larger values of t, such as t = 20mm, the\nevanescent interlayer coupling is negligible and the AT\neﬀect disappears at all frequencies.\nA direct way to witness the formation of asymmet-\nric transmission is to observe the evolution of wave ﬁelds\npropagating inside the model slab. The snapshots in Fig.\n4 calculated using the FDTD algorithm show that, for\nbackward transmission at 8 .7GHz, the outgoing waves\nare always x-polarized (see Fig. 4(e), (j)) even when the\nincident wave is y-polarized (Fig. 4(f)). This is because\nonly the x-polarized wave component at 8 .7GHz is al-\nlowed to pass through the x-oriented ﬁsh-scale metallic\narrays at the outgoing surface. We see from Fig. 4(b)-\n(d) and Fig. 4(g)-(i) that the ﬁeld patterns are twisted\ninside the slab as a consequence of interlayer coupling.\nWe also see that the ﬁeld strength inside the slab re-\nmains high (Fig. 4(c)), even when the incident wave is\nblocked at the entrance surface. These are the features\nof evanescent coupling between metallic layers. The pic-\nture demonstrates that our model slab can function as\n3\nFIG. 4.

(a) and (f): at z = 7.4mm of the incoming regime; (b) and (g): at z = 0 of the front\nsurface(entrance); (c) and (h) at z = −1.1mm within the dielectric layer; (d) and (i) at z = −1.8mm of the backside surface;\n(e) and (j): at z = −8.4mm of the outgoing regime. The local ﬁeld strength, as illustrated by the color bar, is normalized to\nthat of the incident wave.\nFIG. 5. (a) measured and (b) calculated forward transmission\nof our sample slab.\nan ultra-thin polarization transformer just as a waveg-\nuide twist with 900 orientation would function.\nThe transmission spectra through our sample (see Fig.\n1(c)) were measured with a vector network analyzer (Ag-\nilent 8722ES) in an anechoic chamber. The spectra for\nforward transmission are shown in Fig. 5(a). A peak\nvalue of 0.53 was measured at 8.7GHz in the spectrum of\nTxy. Measurements are quantitatively veriﬁed by calcu-\nlations (see Fig. 5(b)) adopting a complex permittivity of\nϵr ≈4.1 + 0.1ifor the FR4 substrate. Almost half of the\nwave energy is removed by the absorption channel (not\nshown) due to a strong enhancement of the local ﬁeld\ninside the slab, which maximizes dielectric dissipation.\nThe reﬂection at 8 .7GHz is still very small.\nIn conclusion, we provide a picture of waveguide twist\nto explain the AT eﬀect of our model slab, which contains\ntwo layers of ﬁsh-scale metallic wires. Calculations on\nthe AT with respect to diﬀerent slab thicknesses and the\nspatial evolution of the local ﬁeld veriﬁes that near-ﬁeld\ninterlayer coupling enables the polarization transforma-\ntion of the outgoing waves, whereas the linearly polarized\nincident wave can only propagate into the slab in one di-\nrection, giving rise to one-way asymmetric transmission.\nOur ﬁndings are beneﬁcial for the design of optical iso-\nlators based on planar chiral metamaterials.
