To address these\ndiﬃculties, we suggest technical and community-based approaches need to combine to acknowledge and\naddress complex and intersectional language model bias.\n1 Introduction\nLanguage models are an important class of the neural\nnetworks that underpin Artiﬁcial Intelligence applic-\nations and services. They are responsible for auto-\nmated linguistic capabilities such as sentiment analysis,\nquestion answering, translation, text-to-speech, speech\nrecognition and auto-completion. Compared to rule-\nbased and statistical methods, they exhibit superior\nperformance in many of these tasks [21]. As a con-\nsequence language models power a growing number of\neveryday digital services, from search ( Google Search,\nMicrosoft Bing ) to smart assistants ( Amazon Alexa ,\nApple Siri ) and email auto-completion (Microsoft Out-\nlook, Gmail).\nSuch models utilise prior context to suggest likely\nsuccessor terms in a language generation task. Gen-\neralised pre-trained models, such as the GPT class of\nmodels [20, 31, 36] developed by OpenAI1, have been\nshown to excel at predictive tasks. The release ofGPT-\n2 models of increased size over the course of 2019 [31]\nbrought transformer-based language models and their\ncapabilities to greater media and public attention (e.g.\n[38]).\nAs the size, performance, capabilities and applica-\ntions of such models grow, so too have concerns about\nprediction bias [40, 26, 48] and its social impacts [11,\n13]. ‘Bias’ itself has varied meanings in the machine\nlearning literature, and as discussed further below,\nhere we limit discussion to measurable, systemic (non-\nrandom) and undesired diﬀerences in model predictions\nproduced by input changes to one or more markers of\nsocial categories. Although a subject of considerable\nresearch in NLP and deep learning ﬁelds, bias remains\na trenchant model characteristic, proving diﬃcult to\nmitigate. Even when trained on large corpora and\nwhen comprising more than a hundred billion para-\nmeters, causal models continue to exhibit gender [26],\nreligion [48] and disability [41] bias.\nDespite acknowledging its importance [27, 34, 49],\nscholars have paid less attention to intersectional bias\nin language models [50]. One non-exclusive method\nfor identifying intersectional bias involves detecting dif-\nferences, through a metric such as sentiment or tox-\nicity, between outputs involving multiple social cat-\negory markers from outputs produced by any one of\nthose markers alone. While the presence of diﬀerences\nin language models is unlikely to mirror precisely the\ndiverse experiences of intersectional bias in social life, it\nis also unlikely that such diﬀerences exhibit obvious or\nconsistent relationships (e.g. additive, multiplicative,\nsingle category maximum). As intersectionality theor-\nists have suggested, prejudice does more than simply\naccumulate over each category of social diﬀerence or\ndisadvantage. Rather the combination of categories\ncan result both in diﬀerent intensiﬁcations of negat-\nive bias and sentiment, and in qualitatively new forms\nof marginalization and stigmatization [1, 9]. Meas-\nurement does not therefore exhaust intersectional bias\nidentiﬁcation, but can support future mitigation ef-\n1https://openai.com/\n1\narXiv:2107.07691v1  [cs.CL]  16 Jul 2021\nforts.\nIn addition, similar to [41] we aim to extend ana-\nlysis of single-category bias to less studied categor-\nies such as disability. In examining disability as a\nsingle category and intersectionality, we consider how\nbias can manifest diﬀerently across and within impair-\nment groups, including what the UN Convention on the\nRights of Persons with Disabilities [3] terms “physical,\nmental, intellectual or sensory impairments”.\n2 Related Work\nBias has been a long-standing concern in AI and NLP\nresearch [26]. Research on language models and data\nsets has begun to self-report against bias metrics [36,\n37], and others have developed checklists for testing\nmodel fairness and accuracy [46, 43]. We discuss here\nexamples of three types of work: (i) techniques for\nidentifying bias; (ii) techniques for mitigating or ad-\ndressing bias; and (iii) sociological research on the ways\nalgorithmic bias may result in adverse social eﬀects.\nOur own work contributes to intersectional aspects of\n(i) and (iii), and we also consider approaches from the\nliterature that may address (ii).\nBias Identiﬁcation\nGender bias has been studied across language mod-\nels involving word embeddings [10] and contextual em-\nbeddings [35], as well as in neural machine translation\n(NMT) [32] and other natural language processing sys-\ntems [33]. Racial and religion-based bias is also in-\ncreasingly studied in algorithmic systems [18], and in\nlanguage models speciﬁcally [50, 48].\nWord embeddings, based on word2vec [6] and\nGLoVE [7], establish, for each unique term found in\na text corpus, a set of weights that confer a sense of\nproximity to adjacent terms. For semantically related\nterms, such as ‘woman’, ‘man’ and other gender labels,\ntheir vectors within a d-dimensional space are likely to\nbe similar (as measured by cosine similarity or other\nmetrics), and together form a subspace that describes\nthat similarity and represents a governing concept such\nas ‘gender’ [10, 26]. Diﬀerences between that subspace\nand other model tokens, such as occupational terms,\nform the basis for identifying bias.\nTransformer-based languages models such asBERT\n[14], ELMO [19] and GPT [20, 31, 36] add positional-\nand sentence-level to word- or token-level embed-\ndings. These enable decoders responsible for transla-\ntion, auto-completion or other tasks to attend to the\ncontext in which words or tokens appear. Such contex-\ntual embeddings make bias detection via cosine sim-\nilarity of individual tokens more challenging, though\n[50] shows one method for doing so. Other approaches\ngenerate sentences from pre-deﬁned prompts or tem-\nplates for analysis [35, 24, 48]. Following [10], [35,\n24] then use gender-swapping and compare the embed-\ndings of suggested generated terms with principal com-\nponent analysis. The resulting one or two components\nidentify systematic bias in the association of occupa-\ntion or other social roles with gender.\n[40, 48, 37] instead employ sentiment analysis to ex-\namine respectively, gendered, religious and racial bias.\nThis provides less direct and systematic evaluation, but\nnonetheless generates a measure of bias encountered\nduring language model use. Sentiment also provides\na more generalisable measure for biases that may not\nrelate to social roles such as occupation, but manifest\nin other forms. This is especially true for the kinds\nof bias we ﬁnd below generated by label combinations\nthat denote the intersection of multiple social categor-\nies.\nBias Mitigation\nMany approaches to mitigating or addressing bias have\nbeen proposed. Broadly, these can be distinguished\nas data-driven, model-driven or use-driven. Discussing\ngender bias, [33] suggest ‘data augmentation’, ‘gender\ntagging’ and ‘bias ﬁne tuning’ as examples of data-\ndriven approaches; removing subspaces (e.g. gender)\nor isolating category-speciﬁc information in word em-\nbeddings as examples of model-driven approaches; and\nconstraining or censoring predictions as examples of\nuse-driven approaches.\nModel design has increasingly sought to address\nbias using various data-driven approaches, either dur-\ning training or via ﬁne-tuning. Both GPT-2 and GPT-\n3 [31, 36] use criteria such as Reddit popularity and\nweights to de-bias training data, while ‘The Pile’, de-\nveloped in part to train GPT-NEO, has sought to in-\ncorporate a wider range of text [37]. As [37] also point\nout, careful curation of training data goes some way to-\nwards addressing at least more conspicuous bias. [51]\nsuggests a mitigation approach based on (1) training a\nde-biased upstream model and then (2) ﬁne-tuning a\ndownstream model.\nModel-driven approaches treat the language model\npost-training. For models involving word embeddings,\nthese embeddings can be inspected, and following a de-\nbiasing heuristic, modiﬁed directly. [10] for example\nconducts a component analysis to identify bias, and\nthen manipulates embedding values, to either increase\nor decrease cosine values between category terms in\naccordance with the analysis. Such techniques appear\nmore diﬃcult to apply to transformer models with con-\ntextual embeddings. [35] for example examines both\ndata augmentation and model neutralisation, and ﬁnds\nmodel neutralisation less eﬀective.\nUse-driven approaches constrain or modify inputs.\n[48] shows for instance how inclusion of modiﬁers can\nproduce radically diﬀerent predictions for terms (like\n‘Muslim’ in their study) showing strong negative bias in\nGPT-3. More generally, generalised pre-trained mod-\nels make possible ‘one-shot’ or ‘few-shot’ training [36],\npadding inputs with a small number of prior examples,\nthat can selectively condition predictions. Such ap-\nproaches depend upon knowledge of what biases exist,\nso they may correct for them, and moreover may pro-\nduce other unintended eﬀects, such as less relevant and\n2\nlower quality outputs. We suggest in our Discussion be-\nlow there are prospects for using category-neutral pre-\ndictions as few-shot examples for de-biasing category-\nspeciﬁc predictions.\nSocial Consequences of Bias\nAs they become increasingly deployed, language mod-\nels invariably produce social consequence. Sociological\nstudies have pointed to ways in which algorithmic bias\ncan amplify existing real-world racism and sexism [18,\n25] and reproduce downstream eﬀects of such preju-\ndice with respect to employability, insurability and\ncredit ratings [8, 12]. In the context of language mod-\nels, [11] discuss speciﬁc risks of ‘exclusion, overgen-\neralization, bias conﬁrmation, topic overexposure and\ndual use’. Even methods developed to prevent harm\ntowards minority groups can exacerbate inequalities.\n[42] for example found intersectional bias in the Twit-\nter datasets used to train algorithms that detect hate\nspeech and abusive language on social media, noting\nhigher rates of tagged tweets from those posted by\nAfrican-American men.\nHowever, most research on algorithmic bias, includ-\ning intersectional bias [50], remains focused on race and\ngender categories. While disability scholars have long\nstudied issues concerning technology bias, and have re-\ncently discussed some of the speciﬁc equity and fairness\nconcerns arising from design and use of AI (e.g. [34,\n22, 27, 30]), less attention has been paid to language\nmodel bias towards disability, as well as to sexuality,\nnon-binary genders and other minority social categor-\nies. An exception is [41], which measures toxicity as\nwell as sentiment in BERT model predictions. [52]\nhave also explored using a BERT encoder to identify\nand correct ableist language use.\nOur study diﬀers from these works in two ways: (1)\nit examines GPT rather than BERT models and (2) it\nalso explores intersectional eﬀects which, as [15, 49]\nnote, are both signiﬁcant and understudied. As soci-\nologists have noted (e.g. [1]), combinations of gender,\nrace, religion, disability and other characteristics lead\nto speciﬁc and underacknowledged disadvantage. In\nwhite settler colonial societies that include the United\nStates, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, such dis-\nadvantage occurs both in general social relations and\nin the context of dealing with governmental institu-\ntions: courts, prisons, hospitals, immigration detention\ncentres and psychiatric clinics [9]. As these institutions\ncome to depend on automation for tasks such as claims\nprocessing, records management and customer service,\nlatent language model bias risks perpetuating ongoing\ninjustices and discrimination.\nIn response to these concerns, scholars as well as\ncompanies such as Microsoft2 and Google3 have de-\nveloped fairness principles and practices for AI devel-\nopment and deployment [43]. Though welcome, such\nprinciples have not eradicated bias even from recently\ndeveloped models. While size, model architecture and\ntraining set diversity appears to have some eﬀect in\nreducing both single category and intersectional bias\n(e.g. [50]), the complexity of transformer systems also\nmakes identiﬁcation and redress challenging. This is\nespecially true for intersectional bias, due to the many\nforms expressions of social categories can take: from\ngendered pronouns, person-ﬁrst versus identity-ﬁrst\ndisability ascriptions and subcultural argot and slang\nthat designate intersectional groups, to the role context\nplays in interpreting the sentiment valence of ﬁgurat-\nive expressions [44]. Further, intersectional expressions\ncombine multiple and overlapping categories that cor-\nrespond to complex real-world social marginalization\nand exclusion which change over time and space, and\nwhich manifest diﬀerently in discursive form as a res-\nult.\nConsequently intersectional bias may often not hold\nan obvious relation to bias of individual terms. How-\never the attribution of single categories to overall\nbiased outputs may help to diagnose which intersec-\ntions matter most, and which consequently need to be\naddressed through mitigation techniques. The aim in\nthis paper is to explore one set of combinations with re-\nspect to intersectional bias, and to determine whether\nany such instances of bias can be attributable to single,\nand more addressable, category labels.\n3 Method\nTo test for intersectional bias, we choose a combina-\ntion of three categories: gender, religion and disability.\nGender bias has been widely studied, and its inclu-\nsion here allows for comparison with prior work. Reli-\ngion and disability bias has received some attention [48,\n41], but not in relation to the same language models,\nnor as intersectional categories. All three categories\nhave relatively unambiguous category markers, though\nsome common identity-ﬁrst disability qualiﬁers, such as\n‘disabled’, ‘deaf’ and ‘blind’, are frequently, and often\ncontentiously, used in contexts outside of social iden-\ntity categories. For example, ‘disabled’ has often been\nused in technical literature to mean turned or switched\noﬀ. While a feature of transformer models has been\ntheir ability to disambiguate homophones (such as var-\nied meanings of ‘like’), performance on metaphoric or\nanalogic modiﬁers varies.\nOur selection of terms is based on what is generally\nconsidered common use, as discussed further in rela-\ntion to each of the three categories below. This aims\nto mirror commonality of these terms in the language\nmodels themselves, which are weighted towards media\nand social media text samples, rather than academic,\nadvocacy or other literature. We note that this ap-\nproach means, on the one hand, that norms and pref-\nerences around terminology and identity of particular\ndisability groups may not always be reﬂected in selec-\ntion of terms and, on the other, more extreme examples\nof biased language use may also not be generated and\n2https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/ai/responsible-ai\n3https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/\n3\nidentiﬁed.\nWe select ﬁve categories of religion, following the\nWorld Religion Paradigm [4]. Though this paradigm\nis challenged in the literature, it likely reﬂects common\nreligious terms of use in language model training sets.\nWe add ‘atheism’ as a marker of explicit non-religious\norientation, and an empty string (‘’) as a null marker.\nWith studies of coreference bias [21, 23], grammat-\nical and social categories necessarily align, and gender\nis treated as binary- or ternary-valued. For auto-\ncompletion tasks, this constraint can be relaxed. We\nadd ‘transgender person’ to ‘woman’ and ‘man’, and\ninclude ‘person’ as an un-gendered marker.\nDisability terms come in various forms, with the\ntwo most commonly accepted versions being people-\nﬁrst and identity-ﬁrst. Terms chosen for this analysis\nare not exhaustive, and also not universally accep-\nted within the disability community. As with gender\nand religious categories, term selection does not im-\nply endorsement, but rather represents a compromise\nbetween contemporary linguistic norms and likely term\nfrequency within language model data sets, which re-\nﬂect historical use. We follow [17] in determining which\nform is preferred, since these recent journalistic recom-\nmendations represent a reasonable balance between sci-\nentiﬁc and colloquial language use, and are also in-\nformed by disability community advocacy.\nWe select two kinds of disability from ﬁve major\ncategories of sensory, physical, neurodivergent, cognit-\nive and psycho-social disability.\n• Sensory: blind, deaf\n• Physical: with quadriplegia , who uses a wheel-\nchair\n• Neurodiverse: autistic\n• Cognitive: with Down Syndrome\n• Psycho-social: with OCD, with schizophrenia\nWe also include ‘disabled’ as a general marker of\ndisability, and an empty string (‘’) to signify a null\nmarker. Each category is used to generate part of a\nprompt of the following form:\n‘A/An’ TDisability\npre TReligion TGender TDisability\npost\nExamples include:\n‘An autistic Muslim man’\n‘An atheist woman with OCD’\nPrompts constructed from combinations of terms\n(7 religion * 4 gender * 10 disability markers = 280\ncombinations) are used to generate samples of 100 sen-\ntences from publicly available causal language models.\nFollowing [40, 37, 48], we apply sentiment ana-\nlysis to the generated sentences. During initial testing,\nwe examined a total of ﬁve sentiment analysis met-\nrics to classify sentences. First, we applied the de-\nfault sentiment analyser supplied by the HuggingFace\ntransformer library, DistilBERT base uncased ﬁne-\ntuned SST-2, a lightweight but high quality [47] binary\nclassiﬁer derived from BERT [29]. We have not modi-\nﬁed the classiﬁer’s conﬁguration from the defaults. The\nsoftmax activation means sentences are coarsely classi-\nﬁed, producing confounds (e.g. ‘neutral’ sentences that\nare classiﬁed as highly negative). To counteract this,\nwe also tested NLTK’s sentiment classiﬁer [2], which is\nmore discriminatory but human review determined to\nbe less accurate. We also analyse generated sentences\nwith and without the prompt itself, since sentiment\nanalysers may introduce bias of their own. We take the\nsoftmax scores in the range (0 ,1), since these reduce\nthe divergence from central values. Finally, we applied\na sigmoid rather than softmax activation to sentiment\nlogit scores. This metric appeared higher quality than\nNLTK, and oﬀers more discrimination compared with\nsoftmax values (it is less likely to produce values that\nconverge to 0 or 1). Softmax results are reported, since\nthey are consistent with common classiﬁer use, but sig-\nmoid results have also been checked for consistency.\nWe apply tests to two publicly available trans-\nformer model families designed for auto-completion:\nfour GPT-2 models (124M, 355M, 774M and 1.5B)\nmodels; and four GPT-NEO models (125M, 350M,\n1.3B and 2.7B) released in March and April 2021, an\nopen source implementation of the GPT-3 architec-\nture. This produces eight models in total. GPT-NEO\nis trained on ‘The Pile’ [37], which has been designed\nand evaluated in part to address gender and religious\nbias. Sentences are generated from zero-shot uncon-\nditional prompts through the Huggingface interface to\nboth models, using parameters suggested by [45]: 50\ntokens; top-k sampling [16], to limit next-word distri-\nbution to a deﬁned number of words, also set to 50; and\ntop-p nucleus sampling [39], set to 0.95, to sample only\nwords that contribute to that probability distribution.\nThese parameters are likely to be used in many real-\nworld text generation settings, e.g. for story-telling or\nchatbots, and are for that reason adopted here.\nWe deﬁne bias and its converse, fairness, as the\ndiﬀerence or similarity between sentiment scores for\nprompts that are distinguished by categories of gender,\nreligion, disability or other markers of social distinc-\ntion. Following [5, 40], in order to be considered fair\nor unbiased, a prompt containing a description of an\nindividual speciﬁed by any one or more of these mark-\ners should produce a sentence with, on average, the\nsame sentiment score as any other prompt containing\ndiﬀerent, or absent, markers from the same category\nsets.\nAs with [40], ‘demographic parity’ is met un-\nder the following conditions. For any category such\nas gender, a set of values is deﬁned, e.g. A =\n{Male,Female,Transgender,Unspecified }, and A=\na denotes a random variable with a value of a ∈A.\nAgain following [40], another value ˜ a is chosen from\nA\\ a. A sentiment classiﬁer, fs, produces outputs in\nthe interval (0,1), and a language model, LM, gener-\nates sentences LM(x) and LM(˜ x), where x and ˜ xare\nprompts containing a and ˜a respectively.\nPs(x) and Ps(˜ x) represent distributions of\nfs(LM(x)) and fs(LM(˜ x)); parity is met when these\n4\ndistributions are equivalent, given a margin of error, ϵ.\nIntersectional bias is deﬁned in the same way, but for\nup to three variables, A= a, B = b and C = c, where\na, b and c belong to sets of gender, disability and\nreligious categories, and each is included in prompt\nx. Disparity, or bias, occurs when the distribution\ndiﬀerences exceed ϵ.\nWe utilise simpliﬁed measures of bias, where ϵ val-\nues are derived via standard tests of distribution diﬀer-\nence, ANOVA and t-tests. In particular, if t-test com-\nparing distributions Ps(x) and Ps(˜ x) produces a large\nenough t-value <.0 (p<. 001), then LM is negatively\nbiased towards x.\nIn addition, we use exploratory topic modelling and\nregression to examine what semantic associations and\ncategory variables contribute to bias. We also explore\nseveral prompt variations, including few-shot cases.\nWe test for four hypotheses:\n1. Language models exhibit individual bias across\nall categories (gender, disability, religion), con-\nsistent with other studies (e.g. [48, 41]).\n2. Language models exhibit intersectional bias. Not\nall examples of intersectional bias can be inferred\nfrom individual bias.\n3. Overall, model size should produce more bal-\nanced predictions across all categories, and show\nreduced bias. For example, GPT-2 ’s 1.5B para-\nmeter model should produce less bias than its\n125M parameter model. However we also hy-\npothesise that some categories and intersectional\ncombinations may receive lower scores in larger\nmodels, in ways that may be systematic, and re-\nﬂect a more true bias in the training data set,\ndue to the elimination of noise. This hypothesis\nfollows [49] suggestion that larger models do not\nnecessarily eliminate bias, and indeed may intro-\nduce more subtle forms.\n4. Diversity and weighting of data sets should re-\nduce eﬀects of some (but not necessarily all) bias\nin comparably sized models. For example, GPT-\nNEO’s 1.3B model should produce less biased\nresults than GPT-2 ’s 1.5B model. Similar to\nthe preceding hypothesis, we also anticipate some\ncases where categories score substantially lower,\neven with more carefully curated data. Since\ntraining data is a major diﬀerence between GPT-\n2 and GPT-NEO model families, we measure this\nexpectation through analysis of model type.\n4 Results\nShown in Table 1, overall mean scores indicate compar-\nable sentiment across all models, with GPT-NEO 2.7B\nbeing most positive. ANOVA results aggregated across\nall models for gender, religion and disability categor-\nies show diﬀerences that are statistically signiﬁcant.\nCategory results are reported in descending order of\naverage scores.\nModel 2-SM 2-MD 2-LG 2-XL N-SM N-MD N-LG N-XL Ave\n0.26 0.25 0.27 0.24 0.29 0.27 0.32 0.34 0.28\nTABLE 1: Sentiment averages across\nlanguage models\nGender scores show ‘man’ to be the worst perform-\ning category for all models, followed by ‘woman’.

Similarly,\nprompts that use person-ﬁrst disability language per-\nform better than identify-ﬁrst, with prompts contain-\ning neurodiverse and cognitive disabilities also scor-\ning comparatively highly. Prompts that reference\n5\nFigure 1: Highest and lowest 10 sentiment scores.\n‘Muslim’, and to a lesser degree ‘Hindu’ and ‘Christian’\nreligious categories perform worse than ‘Buddhist’,\n‘Atheist’ and ‘Jewish’.\nIntersections\nFigure 1 shows the top and bottom 10 category combin-\nations, where all three categories are included, ordered\nby model mean sentiment analysis scores.\nThese results conﬁrm the analysis of single categor-\nies. Categories that produce lower sentiment in aggreg-\nate feature in lower scoring prompts, and vice versa for\ncategories with higher aggregate scores. This suggests\nthat to a large degree, intersectional language model\nbias can be inferred from the single categories from\nwhich they are derived.\nIntersectional comparisons\nTo test intersectional bias, each full combination of\nthree categories was compared with results for each\ncategory, and separately with each category and pairs\nof categories. All comparisons were conducted with\nt-tests.\nOf 252 distinct prompts, 19 or 8.8 per cent had\nlower average sentiment than each of the single cat-\negories considered in isolation. Only 2, or .9 per cent,\nhad higher average sentiment scores. When compared\n6\nwith all individual and paired categories, 2 or .9 per\ncent had lower average sentiment scores, and none had\nhigher.\nAppendix A shows the 19 prompts. Again, these\nreﬂect the overall category results – gender speciﬁcity,\nidentify-ﬁrst disability, and Muslim, Hindu and, to a\nlesser degree, Christian religious categories all contrib-\nute to lower scores. These results point to the mul-\ntiplying eﬀect of intersectional categories, which also\ncounteract the technical eﬀect of prompt length noted\nabove.\nOnly two intersectional prompts score statistically\nhigher than the individual categories from which they\nare composed: ‘An Atheist person with Down Syn-\ndrome’ and ‘An Atheist transgender person with Down\nSyndrome’. These results point to, conversely, the oc-\ncasional positive eﬀect of combining categories, if those\ncategories already score higher than average.\nWhen three category prompt scores were compared\nagainst both individual and pairs of categories, no\nprompts scored higher while two scored lower: ‘A blind\nHindu woman’ and ‘A deaf Hindu woman’. Such cases\nare rare (less than 1%), yet, since they are not read-\nily predicted, important to acknowledge. In these two\ncases, moreover, their relative ranks decline with in-\ncreased model and training set size, and their scores\nalso decline in absolute terms with increased model\nsize.\nFinally, when pairs of terms are compared with in-\ndividual terms, ﬁve combinations (8.3 per cent, listed\nbelow) performed statistically worse than individual\nterms, and none better. Again all category combina-\ntions reinforce earlier results, with individual categor-\nies that score poorly contributing to worse performance\nfor intersectional categories. These combinations are:\n• ‘A Hindu man’\n• ‘A Muslim man’\n• ‘A Muslim woman’\n• ‘A disabled man’\n• ‘An autistic woman’\nSize, Diversity and Other Factors\nTo test for model size and type, we examined the best\nand worst terms for each of the three categories, sub-\ntracted empty category scores for those categories, and\nconducted t-tests comparing small (under 500M) with\nlarge and GPT-2 with GPT-NEO models. Table 5\nsummarises tand pvalues; for clarity, we modify signs\nto indicate whether diﬀerence magnitudes are increas-\ning or decreasing, relative to null marker scores.\nModel Size Model Type\nt p-value t p-value\nGender\n‘transgender person’ 5.78 <.001 16.44 <.001\n‘man’ 5.91 <.001 -6.80 <.001\nDisability\n‘with Down Syndrome’ 7.05 <.001 -7.99 <.001\n‘disabled’ 0.24 0.81 1.66 0.10\nReligion\n‘Buddhist’ 5.60 <.001 -5.67 <.001\n‘Muslim’ -0.80 0.42 12.04 <.001\nTABLE 5: Difference between null marker and\nhigh and low categories\nIn all cases but ‘disabled’ and ‘Muslim’, larger\nmodel size increases diﬀerences between the categories\nat statistically signiﬁcant levels; for those two categor-\nies, change is not signiﬁcant. GPT-NEO reduces dif-\nferences between ‘person’ and ‘man’, but increases dif-\nference dramatically between ‘person’ and ‘transgender\nperson’. Similarly, diﬀerences between positive disab-\nility and religious categories (‘with Down Syndrome’,\n‘Buddhist’) are reduced, while diﬀerences between neg-\native categories (‘disabled’, ‘Muslim’) increase.\nIn aggregate, as shown in Table 1, GPT-NEO av-\nerage scores are higher than GPT-2 (for all scores,\n.30 > .26), and larger models, with some individual\ngroup variances, score better than smaller ones ( .29 >\n.27). T-tests conﬁrm both results: GPT-NEO mod-\nels produce more positive scores ( t(223,998)=-25.82;\np < .001); as do larger models ( t(223,998)=-14.87;\np < .001). While GPT-NEO diﬀers from GPT-2 in\nother respects, the most salient diﬀerence is the size,\nvariety and weighting of training data. Together these\nresults suggest model size and training set diversity\nhave at best mixed results in terms of bias reduction.\nPrompt length, number of terms and generated sen-\ntence length also plays a confounding role. Prompt\nstring length (.07, p<. 001) and number of terms (.02,\np < .001) both correlate positively, though weakly,\nwith positive sentiment. Generated sentence lengths\n(-.23, p < .001), conversely, correlate negatively with\nsentiment. Surprisingly, prompt length and number of\nterms also correlate negatively with sentence length.\nThis technical artefact may be one factor as to why\ncertain categories (‘transgender person’, ‘with Down\nSyndrome’) produce more positively skewed sentences\nthan others (‘man’, ‘blind’). We consider these im-\nplications, and several further tests, in the discussion\nbelow.\nTopic Modelling\nTo explore what terms language models are associ-\nating with prompts to produce negative or positively\nweighted sentiment scores, we generated topic models\nfor sentences generated from worst and best scoring\nprompts. Generated with the Python gensim package,\na Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model was trained\non 15 passes, and asked to produce ﬁve topics. Gen-\nerated sentences were split into words, stop words and\n7\nother words with 4 characters or fewer were removed,\nand remaining words were lemmatised and stemmed.\nWe modelled topics for worst and best scoring three\ncategory intersectional prompts (‘A blind Muslim man’\nand ‘A Buddhist person with Down Syndrome’). We\nincluded a further approximately mid-ranked prompt,\n‘A Jewish woman with quadriplegia’, containing none\nof the categories featuring in the worst and best scoring\nprompts. Appendix C illustrates prominent resulting\nterms.\nTopic Top 10 most probable words\nTopic 1 state, killed, wearing, attacked, saudi,\npeople, islamic, attack, united, accused\nTopic 2 police, mosque, attack, arrested, allegedly,\ncalled, london, beaten, court, accused\nTopic 3 police, killed, oﬃcer, tried, attack, child,\nthree, street, mosque, attacked\nTopic 4 death, police, found, arrested, sentenced,\nstabbed, allegedly, islamic, british, asked\nTopic 5 arrested, year, sentenced, ﬁrst, islam,\nmosque, prison, white, trying, accused\nTABLE 6: Prompt: ‘A blind Muslim\nman’\nFor the lowest scoring prompt, Table 6 shows topics\ninvariably dealing with violence, criminality and terror-\nism, with little variation. Topic 1 contains references\nto Islam, state and Saudi (Arabia), in connection with\nkilling and attacks. Topics 2 and 4 refer to ‘police’, ‘al-\nlegedly’ and ‘arrested’ in the context of violence, while\nTopics 3 and 5 suggest connections between violence\nand religious buildings such as ‘mosque’.\nTopic Top 10 most probable words\nTopic 1 found, cancer, hospital, walk, condition,\nspinal, israel, husband, father, israeli\nTopic 2 hospital, university, jewish, killed, group,\ntreated, mother, lived, people, severe\nTopic 3 family, treatment, disability, husband, right,\ndoctor, condition, treated, diagnosed, cancer\nTopic 4 disease, accident, year, heart, death,\nmonth, unable, police, medical, condition\nTopic 5 hospital, israel, husband, israeli, found,\nsurgery, cancer, brain, jerusalem, doctor\nTABLE 7: Prompt: ‘A Jewish woman\nwith quadriplegia’\nFor the second mid-scoring prompt, Table 7 fea-\ntures mostly medical topics, with the exception of\nTopic 2, which includes a reference to violence\n(‘killing’).

Topics 2 and 4\ninclude terms related to both family and philosophy,\nwhile Topic 5 includes terms associated with living with\ndisability (‘normal’, ‘diﬀerent’, ‘experience’).\nTogether these results point to very diﬀerent sets\nof topical associations. In the ﬁrst case, disability –\nincluding the speciﬁc disability of blindness, included\nin the prompt itself – do not feature at all. All as-\nsociations are instead with criminality and violence,\nlinked in all topics with Islam. For the second prompt,\ndisability-related topics are prominent, and gendered\nroles and religious sites also feature. For the third\nprompt, religion-related topics again appear often, but\nin associations that are virtuous (‘meditation’, ‘belief’,\n‘teaching’) rather than violent. Family is signiﬁcant for\nboth second and third prompts, while not at all for the\nﬁrst.\nRegression Results\nTo identfy the variables that most impact on senti-\nment scores, we conducted a linear regression with\nseven variables, listed below. The ﬁrst three relate to\nwhether or not a social category was included in the\nprompt; the next two describe aspects of prompts and\ngenerated sentences; and the ﬁnal two reﬂect the size\nof model parameters and training corpus.\n• gender mask - Prompt includes gender speciﬁca-\ntion\n• disability mask - Prompt includes disability spe-\nciﬁcation\n• religion mask - Prompt includes religious spe-\nciﬁcation\n• prompt length - String length of prompt\n• sentence length - String length of generated sen-\ntence\n• model params - Size of model size (in millions of\nparameters)\n• gb vo - Size of training corpus (40GB for GPT-2\nmodels; 800GB for GPT-NEO)\nValues are standardised to the range (0 −1).

Of the social\ncategories, gender and disability speciﬁcity contribute\nnegatively while the category of religion contributes\npositively, but to a very minor degree. Prompt and sen-\ntence length are the most signiﬁcant factors, and longer\nsentences are the most signiﬁcant predictor of negative\nsentiment in this model. Both model and training set\nsize play minor positive roles.\nCounterfactual Tests\nIn response to earlier results, we also tested several\nvariations to prompt form. We used the weakest of the\nmodels (GPT-2 small), to highlight changes. Given the\nsignﬁcance of prompt length, and the decision to use\n‘storytelling’ search parameters, we prepended ‘Once\nupon a time, ’ to prompts.\nIncluding this prompt produced a signiﬁcant change\nin overall sentiment, with mean scores rising from .26\nto .41. Gender mean order reversed, with ‘man’ ob-\ntaining the highest mean ( µ = .43), and ‘woman’ and\n‘transgender person’ the lowest ( µ = .4,.39). Disab-\nility mean scores also changed: ‘with schizophrenia’\nand ‘who uses a wheelchair’ ( µ = .34) scoring lowest,\nthough ‘disabled’ still averaged relatively negative sen-\ntiment. All disabilities produced more negative scores.\nIn the case of religion, ‘Muslim’ continued to rank low-\nest (µ= .33) and ‘Buddhist’ highest ( µ= .50). Other\nreligions, as well as ‘Atheist’ and no religion, all pro-\nduced comparable means, in the range of .40 −.42.\nSince identity-ﬁrst disability speciﬁcation gener-\nated lower sentiment scores, we also compared identity-\nﬁrst with person-ﬁrst equivalents (‘with a disability’).\nResults showed that GPT-2 scores are consistently\nhigher for person-ﬁrst variants, though not at statistic-\nally signiﬁcant levels. These results remained the same\nwith the addition of prepended text.\nWe also conducted a number of smaller ad-hoc tests\nwith other leading text fragments, such as ‘In today 's\nnews, ’, ‘Thankfully, ’ and ‘I am ’ (following [41]).\nThese reversed the results generated by ‘Once upon\na time, ’ and were consistent with the absence of any\nadditional text, suggesting prompt length is not alone\nenough to shift bias. It seems likely the prompt also as-\nsisted in setting context, and this produces diﬀerences\nand reversals of some categories – though not others.\nSuch contextually related diﬀerences suggest language\nmodels do not produce bias in uniform ways. Rather,\n‘weak’ or context-bound biases can be distinguished\nfrom ‘strong’ or context-independent biases.\nFinally, similar to [53] we explored possibilities for\nfew-shot priming and calibration. Using the GPT-\nNEO 1.3B model, we took the ﬁrst three prompts for\na person, and prepended them to the worst performing\nprompt for that model (‘A disabled Muslim man’). On\na small sample ( N = 10), this change eliminated bias\nalmost completely, shifting average scores from 0.118 to\n0.478, close to the scores for ‘a person’ (0 .504). How-\never the generated sentences follow the few-shot ex-\namples very closely, limiting the general utility of this\napproach.\n5 Discussion\nResults conﬁrm our ﬁrst hypothesis: all eight language\nmodels exhibit degrees of individual category bias, ir-\nrespective of model size and training set diversity. In\nrelation to gender, negative sentiment is more preval-\nent in categories of man and woman, compared to both\na gender-neutral term such asperson, and a non-binary\ngender such as transgender person.\nSeveral reasons may explain these results, which\nare consistent with or without other category modiﬁ-\ners. First, word and positional gendered noun embed-\ndings {man / woman }seem associated with other em-\nbeddings generated in journalistic settings (e.g. news\nreports), producing sentences with stronger tenden-\ncies towards negative sentiment. Second, simple word\nlength – in the case of transgender, and even person\n– may trigger stronger associations with other kinds\nof discourse (e.g. activist, academic, encyclopaedic).\nThe addition of even minimal context (‘Once upon a\ntime’) reverses the ranking of man, which suggests that\ngender can be bound closely to other phrases to de-\ntermine the likelihood language models will generate\npredications with positive or negative sentiment.\nIn the case of disability, again strong biases can\nbe found towards both more general modiﬁers, such\nas disabled, and towards identity-ﬁrst modiﬁers, such\nas blind and deaf. This suggests negative bias to-\nwards sensory disability, relative to other categories.\nAgain, word length and, by association, comparative\nspeciﬁcity of the modiﬁer may explain these diﬀerences.\nPerson-ﬁrst modiﬁers for example could more likely be\nused by authors attempting to follow speciﬁc termino-\nlogical practices (although such practices remain con-\ntested by these very communities and scholars), and\ntherefore ﬁnd associated embeddings in more formal\nlanguage examples. Terms such as disabled, blind and\ndeaf also have metaphorical, typically pejorative Eng-\nlish uses, which may skew the types and sentiment\nof sentences generated (though such metaphorical uses\narguably embed prejudice in any case, validating the\ninclusion of negative sentiment in such non-personal\ncontexts). However the addition of a preﬁx like ‘Once\nupon a time’ reverses these results for sensory disabil-\nity (blind, deaf ), suggesting these results, like gender,\n9\nare highly susceptible to context.\nIn relation to religious categories, results show con-\nsistent and strong negative bias towards Muslim, and\nto lesser degrees, Christian and Hindu modiﬁers. Since\nspeciﬁcation of religion overall contributes positively\ntowards sentiment scores, this is less explained by reas-\nons of prompt or sentiment length, and consequently\nseems to reﬂect stronger underlying bias in training\ndata sets. The addition of a contextual preﬁx does not\nmodify the ranking for ‘Muslim’ and ‘Buddhist’ modi-\nﬁers.\nThese results also do not preclude other forms of\nbias, and inverted results, e.g. towards women, trans-\ngender or other gendered positions, being discoverable\nthrough other tests. Indeed when certain phrases, such\nas ‘Once upon a time, ’ or ‘I am ’ is added, sen-\ntences prompted by inclusion of transgender person re-\nceive worse scores, relative both to the same prompts\nwithout the same context, and to other gender terms.\nOur second hypothesis regarding presence of inter-\nsectional bias is partially conﬁrmed: concatenation of\nmultiple categories produces worse overall average sen-\ntiment in many cases. ‘A Buddhist person’ scores more\nhighly than ‘A Buddhist person with Down Syndrome’\nfor instance, and ‘A disabled Hindu man’ scores lower\nthan ‘A Hindu man’. In some, though rare cases, in-\ndividual categories do not predict intersectional scores\nat all: ‘A blind Hindu woman’ and ‘A deaf Hindu wo-\nman’ receive worse scores than any combination of one\nor two terms. However, as the case of ‘A Muslim man’\nsuggests, these results are not consistent, and in many\ncases the presence of additional modiﬁers actually im-\nproves sentiment scores. Hence the hypothesis cannot\nbe conﬁrmed overall, and sentiment does seem to cor-\nrelate positively, if also indirectly and inconsistently,\nwith more rather than fewer terms.\nThe third hypothesis – that model size produces\nless bias – also cannot be conﬁrmed, but has weak sup-\nport. Overall average scores are higher, but standard\ndeviations are also slightly higher (0.093 >0.080). One\nspeciﬁc religious category – ‘Atheist’ – scored worse in\nrelative terms on larger size models, with an average\ndrop of 12 places (out of 280 total). Scores are also gen-\nerally higher with larger models on longer, and hence\nmore intersectional prompts, though not always. In the\ncase of the 1B+ parameter-sized models, ‘A Muslim\nman’ has a higher score than ‘A disabled Muslim man’\nfor example.\nThe fourth hypothesis also cannot be conﬁrmed.\nGPT-NEO diﬀers in a number of ways from GPT-\n2 models, but one key distinction is the increased\nscale and diversity, and reﬁned weighting of training\ndata sets. This produces higher overall sentiment con-\nsistently, yet standard deviations and ranges are also\nmarginally higher. The category of ‘transgender per-\nson’ shows the greatest overall relative decline between\nGPT-2 and GPT-NEO rankings, with an average drop\nof 49 places (out of 280 total).\nThese results suggest that model size and training\nset diversity alone are insuﬃcient to eliminate systemic\nbias in causal language models. In some cases, speciﬁc\ncategories perform more poorly, in relative terms, in\nmodels with larger and more carefully curated training\ndata. Negative diﬀerences between transgender per-\nson and person are found across all GPT-NEO mod-\nels, and only one of GPT-2 models. Larger and better\ntrained language models can also produce greater rel-\native bias at the intersections of social categories which\nare not obvious at a single category level. For example,\na prompt such as ‘A Muslim transgender person with\nDown Syndrome’ produces comparatively positive res-\nults on the weakest models ( GPT-2 ), and worse on\nlarger (GPT-2 XL) and better trained (all GPT-NEO)\nmodels.\nConversely, sometimes the lack of modiﬁers pro-\nduces surprising results. The best performing gender\nis person, while with quadriplegia is one of the more\nhighly ranked disability modiﬁers, and no religious\nmodiﬁer is preferable to any explicit modiﬁer. Yet A\nperson with quadriplegia is the only prompt containing\nwith quadriplegia to feature in the lowest quintile across\nall models except GPT-2 XL , and performs worse, in\nrelative terms, on the better-trained GPT-NEO mod-\nels.\n5.1 Mitigating Intersectional Bias\nWhile our results focus mostly on identiﬁcation, in this\nsection we consider challenges and prospects for mit-\nigating intersectional bias. In addition to the diﬃ-\nculties of bias mitigation generally in language mod-\nels, we identify four pertaining to intersectional and\ndisability bias: non-deducibility; coincidence of biased\nand preferred phrasing; modiﬁer register; and variable\ncontext-dependencies.\n• Non-deducibility: the presence of some forms of\nintersectional bias that cannot be easily identi-\nﬁed through their single components or categor-\nies. This suggests the need to search and address\nexhaustively every possible combination of terms,\nwhich may be neither practical nor feasible, and\nmay lead language model designers to address\nonly conspicuous or readily detectable bias, as-\nsuming that eﬀorts to identify and mitigate more\ncomplex and ﬁne-grained bias is too costly.\n• Coincidence of biased and preferred phrasing :\nbias may impede or alter language model use\nin unintended ways. For example, after not-\ning that ‘disabled person’ generates consistently\nmore negative scores than person-ﬁrst (and more\nspeciﬁc) language, designers may opt to modify\nuser interfaces for language models to accommod-\nate – disguising bias through templated prompts,\nfor instance. However, identity-ﬁrst language\n(such as ‘disabled person’, rather than ‘person\nwith a disability’) may be preferred by particu-\nlar users belonging to these social groups, and\nsuch prompts or other interface interventions\nwould then construct barriers to accessibility and\npresent a new, if unintended, form of bias and\ndiscrimination. This ﬁnding suggests a broader\n10\nproblem of bias mitigation in language models –\nthe lack of consensus and ongoing modiﬁcation\nof preferences and social standards around lan-\nguage use and social identities, and the rights of\ngroup members to use their preferred terms to\nself-deﬁne their social identities.\n• Modiﬁer register: for transformer-based models,\naddressing intersectional bias systematically – on\nthe basis of speciﬁc words or morphemes for in-\nstance – is complicated by technical and con-\ntextual artefacts. As an example of a technical\nartefact, one feature that reduces bias is prompt\nstring length. Longer strings (composed of longer\nor more numerous words) appear to direct lan-\nguage models into selecting contexts trained from\nwhat might be thought to be less – or less evid-\nently – biased texts, such as scholarly and en-\ncyclopaedic texts. This may produce in certain\ncases less bias towards prompts derived from mul-\ntiple and intersectional categories, but also biases\nthat, in the case of disability, are systemic. For\ndisabilities whose labels have transferred from\nmedical to public discourse, such as quadriple-\ngia or schizophrenia, results appear consistently\nhigher.\n• Variable context-dependency: the variations in-\ntroduced by adding a simple and neutral preﬁx\nindicate that language model bias can be sys-\ntemic – as in the case of religious modiﬁers –\nor highly suggestive to context. More work is\nneeded to understand the ways context-bound\nand context-insensitive bias work across diverse\nsocial categories.\nAddressing these and other challenges – includ-\ning those covering other categories such as race and\nsexuality, where bias is present in many of the histor-\nical and current texts used to train language models\n– requires distinct and diverse strategies. Alongside\ntechnical methods, such as embedding modiﬁcation,\nmodel ﬁne-tuning, multiple evaluation metrics and al-\ngorithmic prediction adjustment (e.g.[28]), we also ad-\nvocate for social approaches: study of the eﬀects of\nbias on at-risk communities; developer and end-user\nrisk education; and inclusion in language model design\nand evaluation of members of minority groups subject\nto bias.\nWe outline three approaches - prompt calibration,\nself-reporting and community validation – that could\nassist with mitigation:\n• Prompt calibration: Similar to [53], we explored\nthe possibility of using category-neutral prompts\nto generate ‘adversarial’ sentences that can serve\nas few-shot examples to language model predic-\ntions for category combinations that receive sig-\nniﬁcantly lower scores. This corrects bias, with\nthe trade-oﬀ of a dilution of the complexity of\npredictions – the few-shot examples dominate\nprediction topicality as well as sentiment. How\nto retain the full ﬂexibility of a language model\nwhile using few-shot examples to constrain bias\nis a subject for further work.\n• Self-reporting: Discussions of the provenance of\nlanguage models relies upon self-reporting by\ntheir authors, and standardised bias evaluation of\neven single categories such as gender remains un-\nderdeveloped [33]. As bias studies mature, mod-\nels could begin to report on bias in standard-\nised ways, which might be accessible by end-users\nthrough specialised operator instructions. A sig-\nnature or ‘magic’ prompt, for instance, could out-\nput the leanings of the model, in response to prior\nevaluations. As such models become standard\nparts of many operating environments – in cus-\ntomer service chat bots for example – it might be\nreasonable to expect that an answer to a stand-\nardised query such as ‘Who am I talking to?’ con-\ntains evidence of the model’s personality and his-\ntory: how it was trained, and what kinds of bias\nthat training likely produces.\n• Community Validation: Even when text corpuses\nare weighted for quality [37], they retain strong\nbias against certain groups and identities. Con-\ntinued bias registered by prompts containing the\nterm ‘Muslim’, for example, shows that texts that\ndiscuss Muslim people in more varied ways, set-\ntings and contexts need to be included or re-\nweighted to greater degrees. This poses further\nquestions, such as how weight adjustments may\nin turn lead to other latent category prejudices\nemerging. As metrics for language bias begin to\nstandardise, speciﬁc communities could have op-\nportunity to vote, tag, rate, modify and validate\ntraining sets, to ensure training and ﬁne-turning\ncorpora to reﬂect community standards and ad-\ndress biases that perpetuate prejudice and disad-\nvantage.\n6 Conclusion\nWe conclude that (1) bias exists at signiﬁcant levels\nacross diﬀerent social categories (gender, religion and\ndisability); (2) it can manifest, in unpredictable ways,\nat category intersections; and (3) it is resistant to in-\ncreases in model size and training data diversity. Spe-\nciﬁcally, while gender bias is minor and heavily condi-\ntioned on prompt context, religion and disability bias is\nstrongly evident and resistant to context, with Muslim\nand all disability labels other than ‘with Down Syn-\ndrome’ scoring worse than no label.\nWhile individual bias does contribute to intersec-\ntional scores and rankings, our results include excep-\ntions. Topic modelling shows that sentiment scores\nalso correspond with important qualitative changes in\nmodel predictions; just as with real-world experience,\nintersectional bias in language models manifests in dif-\nferent forms as well as degrees.\n11\nWhile our results demonstrate the consistent pres-\nence of single category and intersectional bias across\ngender, disability and religion in several varieties and\nsizes of causal language models, they suﬀer from sev-\neral limitations. As the results of prompt variations\nshow, comparatively trivial additions can produce dif-\nferent overall sentiment as well as orderings between so-\ncial categories, without erasing bias altogether. Since\nprompts and model hyperparameters will likely vary\nacross language model applications – ‘storytelling’\nmodes, chat Q&A sessions, generation of advertising\ncopy, and so on – the task of identifying bias pres-\nence and intensity needs to be tailored to application\nand context. Although we control for prompt inclu-\nsion, metrics such as sentiment classiﬁcation are also\nsubject to biases of their own. In addition, the eﬃcacy\nof ﬁne-tuning and other bias mitigation strategies have\nnot been evaluated systematically. Finally, other social\ndistinctions – race, sexuality, class – will likely produce\nfurther kinds and degrees of bias, both at single cat-\negory and intersectional levels.\nAs they become embedded in everyday comput-\ning, language models can be expected to produce pro-\nnounced social eﬀects. Our contribution suggests in-\ntersectional bias in language models is not simply a\nfactor of data set diversity, model size or architecture,\nand requires additional methods for identiﬁcation and\nmitigation. In line with the concerns expressed by [49],\nwith models becoming larger and more complex, the\ntask of identifying intersectional bias will likely grow in\ndiﬃculty. Moreover, individual cases show that inter-\nsectional bias cannot be easily estimated from single-\ncategory bias. More work is needed to understand how\ndiverse categories interact in language model predic-\ntion, to ensure their social impacts are equitable and\nnon-discriminatory.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded partially by the Australian\nGovernment through the Australian Research Council.\nIt also has received support, in the form of researcher\ntime and cloud computing credit, from Microsoft Cor-\nporation.\nReferences\n[1] Kimberle Crenshaw. ‘Mapping the Margins: In-\ntersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence\nagainst Women of Color’.
