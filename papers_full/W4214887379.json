INTRODUCTION\nPower transformers are an essential apparatus in the electrical\npower network. It is an expensive item in electrical networks.\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Yu Wang\n.\nThe failure of a power transformer leads to substantial costs\neither due to system outage or due to increased maintenance\ncosts [1]. Oil is used in power transformers as an insulating\nmedium and a heat transfer medium. The transformer oil insu-\nlation condition shall be deteriorated by electrical and thermal\npossible faults. These possible faults can be classiﬁed into\n25954 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Electrical fault types include par-\ntial discharge (PD) as well as low and high energy discharge\n(D1 and D2), while thermal fault types include low, medium,\nand high thermal faults (T1, T2, and T3) [2], [3]. Hence, the\ncontinuous monitoring of oil insulation condition plays an\nimportant role in increasing the power system reliability and\nreducing the risk of power transformer failure. Electrical and\nchemical test techniques are used as diagnostic techniques for\ndetecting the oil insulation condition. Dissolved Gas Anal-\nysis (DGA) is one of the most common chemical methods\nused for detecting the insulation fault type [4]–[6]. During\nthe normal transformer operation, some low concentrations\nof gases are released such as Hydrogen (H 2), Methane (CH4),\nAcetylene (C2H2), Ethylene (C 2H4), Ethane (C 2H6), Carbon\nmonoxide (CO), and Carbon Dioxide (CO 2). While during\nfault conditions, these gases are produced with high con-\ncentrations, and hence DGA techniques depend on detecting\nthe released concentrations in case of thermal and electrical\nstresses [7], [8].\nMany conventional techniques were developed and used\nfor the interpretation of transformer incipient faults based on\nDGA such as key gas ratio [9], Rogers’ ratio [9], [10], IEC\ngas ratio [10], Dornenburg ratio technique [9], and Duval\ntechniques [11], [12]. The conventional approaches do not\noften yield accurate analysis while missing important incip-\nient faults, thereby leading to the ‘no decision’ issue [7].\nMost of the existing DGA techniques have limited diagnostic\naccuracy and may fail to interpret the oil faults in transform-\ners [13]. More studies have been presented to improve the\ntraditional interpretation techniques using artiﬁcial intelli-\ngence (AI) and computational techniques [14]–[16]. How-\never, most AI techniques are complicated and difﬁcult for\npractical engineers to apply. Hence, this research topic is\nstill open for improving the diagnostic accuracy of trans-\nformer faults. Recently, new approaches have been presented\nincluding a combination and integration between the diag-\nnosis results of multiple techniques. Four techniques have\nbeen presented with an accuracy of 69.96%, 84.96%, 83.27%,\nand 85.3% based on using 532 samples [17]. Two graphical\nshapes were presented to improve the diagnosis accuracy of\nthe transformer fault types using the DGA approach [18].\nIn addition, an approach was presented based on the limits\nof new gas concentration percentages to improve the faults\ndiagnostic accuracy [19]. In [20], a model of convolutional\nneural network (CNN) was studied to accurately predict the\ntypes of faults under different levels of noise in measure-\nments. In addition, another proposed DGA technique based\non extreme machine learning was presented as in [21]. Also,\na new maintenance decision-making model was proposed for\npower transformer based on economy and reliability assess-\nment [22]. According to support vector machine (SVM),\na novel technique was proposed to improve the diagnostic\naccuracy of transformer fault types [16]. DGA lacks two\nmain issues. Firstly, its accuracy needs to be increased for\nreliable fault diagnosis. Secondly, it cannot provide sufﬁcient\ninformation about the condition of the transformer oil itself.\nOn the other side, different approaches of diagnosis and\nmonitoring were used, based on a wide variety of thermal,\nmechanical, electrical, and optical effects. These approaches\nprovided information on aging, allowing the state assessment,\nand recommended measures to improve the quality of the\ninsulation and lifetime assessment [23], [24]. One of these\napproaches is the health index, whose evaluation is based on\ndifferent factors [23], [25]. These factors include dielectric\nstrength measurement, DGA, turns ratio, leakage reactance,\nwinding resistance, and degree of polymerization for paper\ninsulation.\nFor breakdown voltage test, it is an indicator for dielectric\nseverity in power transformers [26]. In [27], dielectric char-\nacteristics of transformer mineral oil with different composi-\ntions of corn oil were studied. In addition, the effect of the\nnatural ﬁbres on the dielectric strength of natural ester as a\nliquid insulating material was presented in [28]. In addition,\na comparative study of the positive and negative DC break-\ndown voltages of different transformer oils was presented\nin [29]. The aging characteristics of mineral oil were studied\nin [30]. Further, a temperature rise test was used as an indica-\ntor of thermal severity in power transformers [31]. According\nto the literature review, most existing DGA techniques have\npoor diagnostic accuracy for certain fault types, which in turn\ncan fail to interpret the diverse transformer oil faults. Based\non this notice, a combined DGA method could distinct the\nconﬂict among the various transformer oil faults, yielding\nhigher accuracy rates. Another gap in the literature is that the\nhealth condition index of power transformer oil is estimated\nby individual approaches, which can lead to unreliable esti-\nmation results, thereby it is covered in this work.\nTo cover the abovementioned gap in the literature, this\npaper presents comprehensive predictive maintenance for\npower transformers based on a new DGA technique along-\nside additional health index evaluation that is simultaneously\nbased on the breakdown voltage test, acidity and moisture\nmeasurements, as well as DGA results before and after tem-\nperature rise test. First, the new DGA technique is presented\nand developed using 360 samples of known actual faults\ncollected from the Egyptian Electricity network and from\nliterature. The accuracy of the proposed technique is com-\npared with its construction techniques as well as the recently\npublished techniques. Next, a health index calculation is pre-\nsented, based on the test results of the transformer insulation\nsystem (breakdown strength, dissolved gas analysis, mois-\nture, and acidity) for new and aged transformers. Transformer\ncase study of rating (66/11 kV) of NYTRO 10XN oil type\nis collected from ELMACO Company, Egypt. For calcula-\ntion of the health index of transformer insulation system,\nbreakdown voltage tests for two practical types of transformer\noil; NYTRO 10XN and HyV olt III alongside their mixtures\nare estimated and compared. The oil mixture is investigated\nto study the effect of mixing that could happen inside the\ntransformer in the absence of one of these oils. Finally, a\ntemperature rise test is performed on ﬁve new transformers of\nthe same rating with a comparison between dissolved gases\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25955\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nbefore and after the temperature rise. In addition, winding\nresistance is measured after the temperature rise. Also, acidity\nand moisture are measured for oils extracted from the new\nﬁve transformers and from a 13-year in-service transformer\nfor studying their health index. The health index of the trans-\nformer insulation system is examined using only DGA and\nDGA plus breakdown voltage (BDV), moisture, and acidity.\nII. PROPOSED DGA BASED FAULT DIAGNOSTIC\nTECHNIQUE\nThe existing interpretation techniques have not provided\nproperly accepted results for detecting transformer faults.\nHence, it is an open research area for new proposed DGA\ntechniques to overcome the problems of existing ones. The\nlimiting accuracy of conventional DGA techniques is still a\nmajor problem for diagnosing transformer faults due to inter-\nference between electrical and thermal faults. A newly pro-\nposed technique for fault diagnosis is prepared and presented.\nThis proposed technique is developed based on the integra-\ntion among the results of conventional and non-conventional\ntechniques. These techniques are ﬁve techniques; conditional\nprobability [32], clustering [33], Duval [11], Roger’s four\nratios reﬁned [34], and artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) [35]\ntechniques. A total of 360 samples of known actual faults\nare used in developing the proposed technique, and also are\nused as a dataset for testing the technique accuracy. A total\n120 samples have been recently collected from the Cen-\ntral Laboratory of the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and\n240 samples are extracted from literature [33]. Table 1 sum-\nmarizes the distribution of all these samples for various fault\ntypes.\nThe selected samples have a convergence between the\nnumber of samples for each fault type avoiding a noticeable\ndiscrepancy between number of samples for each fault used\nin the literature [17]. The used datasets have been analyzed\nbased on the IEEE Std. C57.104-2008 [9]. Fig. 1 presents the\nrange of gas concentration percentage (GCP) for each fault\ntype. GCP is the parentage of each gas divided by the sum\nof the ﬁve main gases (H 2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6) as\nshown in the following equations:\nGCPH2 = H2\nH2 +CH4 +C2H4 +C2H6 +C2H2\n% (1)\nGCPCH4 = CH4\nH2 +CH4 +C2H4 +C2H6 +C2H2\n% (2)\nGCPC2H6 = C2H6\nH2 +CH4 +C2H4 +C2H6 +C2H2\n% (3)\nGCPC2H4 = C2H4\nH2 +CH4 +C2H4 +C2H6 +C2H2\n% (4)\nGCPC2H2 = C2H2\nH2 +CH4 +C2H4 +C2H6 +C2H2\n% (5)\nFig. 1(a) shows that H 2 is the most generated gas due\nto the PD fault type. Hence, H 2 is the main key gas in\npartial discharge. Fig. 1(b) shows that Hydrogen (H 2) is\nthe dominant key gas in the case of low energy discharge\n(D1). Acetylene (C 2H2) is the dominant gas in case of high\nenergy discharge (D2), see Fig. 1(c). The Ethan (C 2H6) is the\ndominant gas in low thermal fault, see Fig. 1(d). The methane\n(CH4) and ethane (C 2H6) are the dominant gases in the case\nof medium thermal fault (T2), see Fig. 1(e). Ethylene (C 2H4)\nis the dominant gas in case of high thermal fault (T3), see\nFig. 1(f). These results are summarized in Table 2, indicating\nthat the resulting key gas for each fault type matches the\nstandard IEEE Std. C57.104-2008 [9]. Hence, the accuracy\nand reliability of the used datasets were conﬁrmed.\nA. THE STRUCTURE AND PROCEDURES OF THE\nPROPOSED TECHNIQUE\nThe new technique for the fault diagnosis is prepared based\non the integration among different conventional and non-\nconventional techniques. The best techniques, that exhibited\ngood accuracy, are adopted in this work. These techniques are\nﬁve techniques; conditional probability, clustering, Duval,\nRoger’s four ratios reﬁned, and ANN as shown in Table 3.\nTechniques (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are based on the ﬁve main\ngases (H2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and C 2H2), represented in var-\nious ways. Techniques (1 and 2) are based on the percentages\nof main ﬁve gases with respect to their summation [32], [33]\nas shown in equations from (1) to (5). The technique (3) is\nbased on the percentages of the three gases ratio (R 1, R2, and\nR3) as shown in equations from (6) to (8).\nR1 = CH4\nCH4 +C2H4 +C2H2\n% (6)\nR2 = C2H4\nCH4 +C2H4 +C2H2\n% (7)\nR3 = C2H2\nCH4 +C2H4 +C2H2\n% (8)\nTABLE 1. Number of samples for each fault type.\nTABLE 2. The range of gas concentration percentage for each fault type\naccording to the 360 datasets.\nThe four ratios (R 4, R 5, R 6, and R 7), shown in equations\nfrom (9) to (12), are used for fault diagnosis in Technique (4)\n[34]. While the technique (5) in [35] is composed of multiple\nANNs; the ﬁrst ANN uses the percentages of the three gases\nratio (R 1, R 2, and R 3) as inputs, the second ANN uses the\n25956 VOLUME 10, 2022\nM.

Table 4 shows which of the ﬁve methods\nis more accurate in diagnosing each fault type separately.\nTABLE 3. Integrated techniques used for developing the new proposed\ntechnique.\nThe technique (1) is the more accurate one in all fault types\nexcept for low thermal fault, which can be accurately diag-\nnosed by techniques (4) and (5).

These results were taken into account\nduring the construction of the new technique.\nAccording to the accuracy of the ﬁve techniques for each\nfault type, the proposed technique is constructed based on\nthe integration between them. Its procedures are based on\nthe combination of the most accurate techniques in each\nindividual fault. Preparing and proceeding with the proposed\ntechnique can be accomplished via the ﬂowchart in Fig. 2.\nThe procedures of the proposed technique are implemented\nbased on the diagnosis (Dig) of ﬁve techniques as follows:\nStage 1: If the detection result of conditional probability\nand clustering is partial discharge, the fault type is\ndiagnosed as partial discharge.\nStage 2: If the detection result of conditional probability and\nclustering is high energy discharge, the fault type is\ndiagnosed as high energy discharge.\nStage 3: If Rogers reﬁned result is low thermal fault type,\nthe diagnosis is low thermal fault type.\nStage 4: If the diagnosis of Duval is low energy discharge\nand that of conditional probability is low or high\nenergy discharge, the fault type is diagnosed as low\nenergy discharge.\nStage 5: If Rogers and conditional probability methods diag-\nnosed high thermal fault type, the proposed tech-\nnique result is high thermal fault type.\nStage 6: Medium thermal fault type is detected if the result\nof conditional probability is medium thermal fault\ntype and the results of clustering, Duval, Rogers\nreﬁned, and ANN are low, medium or high thermal\nfault types.\nIf no condition is satisﬁed, the diagnosis result is that of\nconditional probability.\nB.

These previous techniques were constructed\nby combining the results of previous studies. The technique\n(a) was formed based on the outputs of three methods,\nRoger’s four ratios reﬁned, Duval, IEC reﬁned techniques,\nwhile technique (b) was constructed based on three (DGA)\nmethods (Duval triangle, clustering, and conditional proba-\nbility).

Finally, technique (d) was based on the combined\noutputs of techniques (b) and (c) [17]. The improved accuracy\nof the proposed technique is proven using a large number of\ndatasets (360) of known actual faults. For these samples, the\nconvergence between the number of samples for each fault\ntype is taken into account.

TRANSFORMER CASE STUDY\nThis part introduces a real case study for a new transformer\nwith a rating (40 MV A, 66/11 kV) ﬁlled with NYTRO\n10XN oil type. The ﬁrst section of this part presents the\nbreakdown voltage test for the oil type of the study case\nand its comparison with another type (HyV olt III) and\ntheir mixtures. The second section studies the tempera-\nture rise test effect on winding resistance and DGA. Then,\nin the third section, acidity and moisture are measured for\nthe same case study, and the healthy index is calculated\nusing these measurements together with the breakdown volt-\nage measurement and dissolved gases concentrations. The\nhealth index is calculated for several case studies on the\nconsidered new transformer and a case study on an aged\ntransformer.\nA. BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE TEST\nThis section presents the breakdown voltage test as an\nindicator for the dielectric severity in power system\n25960 VOLUME 10, 2022\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nTABLE 8. The proposed technique diagnosis against its construction techniques and previous techniques [17] for validation datasets.\nequipment [36], [37]. Two practical transformer oil types,\nNYTRO 10XN and HyV olt III, alongside with their 50/50%\nmixture were evaluated for breakdown voltage to indicate\nthe dielectric severity of these types. The properties of these\noil types are shown in Table 9. The mixing between oils\nwas carried out to study the effect of mixing that could\nhappen inside the transformer in the absence of one of these\noils. The breakdown voltage test, for each oil sample, was\ncarried out 12 times. In this test, the electrodes of the test\nare mushroom-shaped copper electrodes spaced by 2.5 mm\naccording to IEC 60156 standard [38]. The test was carried\nout using a BAUR oil breakdown voltage tester (Model:\nDTA 100 C) in ELMACO company, Egypt. The test was\napplied on fresh samples of these oil types. For each sam-\nple, it was magnetically stirred for ﬁve minutes before the\nﬁrst measurement, then 12 measurements were carried out.\nBetween each two successive measurements, the oil was mag-\nnetically stirred for two minutes. The results were analyzed\nusing Weibull distribution. The cumulative distribution func-\ntion for a random variable x is computed as in the following\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25961\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nTABLE 9. The characteristics of the used oil types.\nequation [39], [40].\nf (x)=1−e\n−\n(β\nα\n)\nx\n(13)\nwhere αand βare deﬁned as the scale and the shape param-\neters, respectively. These parameters are calculated by the\nfollowing equation [39].\nln (ln [ 1\n1 −f (x)]) =βln x −βln α (14)\nIn the BDV test, the variable x is referred to the breakdown\nvoltage, and the probabilities of different breakdown voltages\nwere estimated using Weibull distribution. Hence, the BDV at\nthe probability of 50% refers to the mean value. The 12 mea-\nsurements of breakdown test for the two oil types and their\nmixture are depicted in Fig. 6(a). According to the breakdown\ntest for NYTRO 10XN, HyV olt III, and their mixture, the\nmean values at the probability of 50% was 71.1 kV , 48.9 kV ,\nand 50.6 kV , respectively, as shown in Fig. 6(b). By mixing\n50% of the two oil types, the dielectric strength was slightly\nimproved compared to pure HyV olt III. However, the type\nof NYTRO 10XN oil remains the best in terms of dielectric\nstrength.\nFor Nytro 10XN oil type, an additional aged oil samples\nwere extracted from a real in-service aged transformer of rat-\ning (40 MV A, 66/11 kV) with different operation durations;\n9, 10, 11, 12, and 13-years. These samples have been tested\nfor a breakdown voltage test. Twelve measurements were per-\nformed for each sample, and their average breakdown values\nwere 77, 75, 27, 65, and 38 kV for 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13-years,\nrespectively, as shown in Fig. 7. Comparing the BDV of the\naged samples and fresh samples, the average BDV was good\nafter 9 and 10-years in-service. After 11-years in-service,\nthe BDV was reduced drastically till reaching 27 kV , which\nis below the acceptable limit, due to the aging occurrence.\nHence, the transformer was taken out of service and the oil\nwas treated and ﬁltered, before returning again to the service.\nAfter the oil treatment and with one more year in-service, the\nbreakdown voltage attained 65 kV after 12-years in-service.\nFinally, after 13-years in operation, the BDV decreased to\n38 kV .\nThe breakdown voltage of the fresh and aged samples\n(13-years in-service) shall be used as an indication for the\nhealth index of oil quality for a new transformer and another\naged one [41], [42].\nB. TEMPERATURE RISE TEST\nTemperature is a quantitative measure of thermal energy con-\ntained in an object, the higher the thermal energy, the higher\nthe temperature. The temperature rise is always deﬁned as\nthe difference between the temperature of an object and the\ntemperature of the corresponding cooling medium (e.g., oil).\nThe thermal run test or overheat test is one of the tests that\nare applied on power transformers.\nThe mean purpose of this test is to check whether the\noil and winding temperatures of the transformer meet the\nvalues speciﬁed in the standards and by technical projects.\nTemperature rise test is performed according to IEC 60076-2\nstandard [43], in which the low voltage winding is short cir-\ncuited, and the voltage is applied to the high voltage winding,\nthen the temperature rise test for the top oil of transformer\nis performed continuously until the winding and oil in the\ntank have reached a stable temperature. This test was carried\nout on a transformer of rating (40 MV A- 66/11 kV) with oil\ntype (Nytro 10 XN). The temperature rise test objective is\nto measure the winding resistance and to predict the fault\npossibility based on the rate of change in dissolved gases\nconcentrations before and after the test. Also, the health index\nfor this transformer is calculated using DGA plus acidity,\nmoisture, and breakdown tests.\n1) MEASUREMENT OF THE WINDING RESISTANCE\nAccording to IEC 60076-2, the measurement values should\nbe carried out under the following conditions: ONAN,\nONAF (100% loading), and ONAF (110% loading for two\n25962 VOLUME 10, 2022\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nFIGURE 6. Breakdown voltage of Nytro 10 XN, HyVolt III and their 50/50% mixture; (a) 12 measurements, and (b) Weibull distribution.\nhours) [43]. The measurement of the winding resistance is\nperformed by the connection of the winding to the DC mea-\nsuring device after the shutdown of the test power. The top oil\ntemperature rise (1θoil−max) does not correspond to the real\nhot spot winding temperature ( 1θhot−spot) as indicated from\nthe following equation.\n1θhot−spot =1θoil−max +g.H (15)\nThis is due to the inﬂuence of the increased stray loss\ncaused by the horizontal component of stray ﬂux. The wind-\ning oil gradient g at the top of the winding has to be\nmultiplied by the factor H. This factor H may vary from\n1.1 to 1.5 depending on the transformer size, short circuit\nimpedance, and winding design. In this case study, it is taken\nas 1.3.\nThe instrumentation used for the measurement is of\nautomatic recording, where a considerable number of dis-\ncrete readings are being made over a period of time,\nand these have to be evaluated for extrapolation backward\nin time to the instant of the shutdown. The change of\nwinding resistance against time are shown in Fig. 8 and\nFig. 9 for high voltage winding and low voltage winding,\nrespectively.\n2) DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS BEFORE AND AFTER THE\nTEMPERATURE RISE TEST\nDGA has been performed for the transformer oil. The ﬁrst\nsample was taken before the temperature rise test, while the\nsecond sample was taken approximately 24 hours after the\ntemperature rise test, according to IEC 60076-2 [43]. This\nstudy was performed on ﬁve new transformers of the same\nrating and oil type before and after the test. In addition, for the\n13-years in-service transformer, DGA has been performed.\nThese studying cases were to conﬁrm the results obtained.\nFor the new ﬁve cases, the gases H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 4, C 2H6,\nC2H4, and C 2H2 are generated with the increase in tem-\nperature. Oil samples are analyzed in the Central Chemical\nLaboratories of the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity. The oil\nsampling was manually performed according to IEEE Std.\nC57.104 and IEC 60567 [9], [44]. The samples were taken\nfrom a certain point in the transformer tank, through which\nthe oil is circulating. This is to increase the chance to catch\ngases generated in various locations in the transformer tank\nrather than that generated locally at the sampling point.\nThe oil syringe used for sampling and transporting to the\nChemical Laboratories is in the 50 ml range. For extracting\nthe oil sample, the sampling valve is wiped for cleaning.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25963\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nFIGURE 7. The measured breakdown voltages with different in-service durations; 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 years for Nytro 10 XN;\n(a) Weibull distributions, and (b) average measured values.\nFIGURE 8. Average winding temperatures for high voltage winding.\nThen, the valve is allowed to ﬂush 2 to 3 times to remove\nwater and debris before a sufﬁcient amount of oil is ﬁlled\ninside the syringe without causing aeration/bubble. Finally,\nthe oil temperature is recorded, and the syringe is closed,\nsealed, and stored for transport. Fig. 10 shows the considered\nposition and used tools for extracting oil samples. For each\ncase of the new ﬁve transformers, two samples of oil are\nFIGURE 9. Average winding temperatures for low voltage winding.\nanalyzed using DGA, before and after the temperature rise\ntest. The ﬁrst sample for each case was taken two hours before\nthe temperature rise test, while the second sample was taken\nafter 24 hours of the temperature rise test, as recommended\nin IEC 60076-2 [43].\nThe results of DGA before and after the temperature\nrise for the new ﬁve cases of transformers are presented in\nTable 10 alongside with the DGA result for the aged case.\nAccording to these results, the diagnosis of new transformer\n25964 VOLUME 10, 2022\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nFIGURE 10. Dissolved gas analysis sampling process and used tools.\ncases before and after temperature rise is normal because the\ngases concentration is not exceeding the limits speciﬁed IEEE\nStd. C57.104 [9]. While by analyzing the rate of increase in\ndissolved gases for case study No. 1, there was an increase\nin the gases CO 2, CO, and H 2 after the temperature rise test.\nThe concentration of CO 2 gas increased approximately twice,\nwhile the concentration of H 2 and CO increased approxi-\nmately three times. The CO 2 gas was an indicator for the\npaper health condition. For the case study No. 2, CO and\nCO2 concentrations were reduced by the temperature rise\ntest, which were considered illogical. This may be because\nof the exposure of samples to atmospheric leaks. However,\nthe C 2H6concentration was 24 times higher than that before\nthe test. Case study No. 3 was not highly affected by the\ntemperature rise test, since the rise in gases was only 1 ppm,\n9 ppm, and 1 ppm for H 2, CO, and CH 4, respectively. CO 2\nconcentration was reduced slightly after the test due to pos-\nsible atmospheric leaks. Whereas the temperature rise test\nresulted in a rise in three gases H 2, CO2, and CO by 11 ppm,\n62 ppm, and 4 ppm, respectively for case study No. 4. The\ndiagnosis of the transformer case study No. 5 before and\nafter the temperature rise is normal according to IEEE Std.\nC57.104. While by analyzing the rate of increase in dissolved\ngases for this case, there were three gases (CO 2, CO then H 2)\nthat had the greatest effect by the temperature rise, in addi-\ntion to a slight increase in CH 4 and C 2H4 concentrations.\nFig. 11 summarizes the change in dissolved gases before\nand after the temperature rise test for the new ﬁve cases\nof transformers. For the aged case, it has higher values of\ngas concentrations, as shown in Table 10, which has been\ndiagnosed as a high thermal fault type.\nC. ACIDITY AND MOISTURE MEASUREMENTS\nBy the chemical reactions in the oil, carboxylic acids are\nproduced. Increased acidity of the oil affects the electrical\nproperties of the oil itself, and it may also cause abnor-\nmal deterioration of the paper insulation used in transformer\nwindings [45], [46]. For the moisture, its presence can dete-\nriorate transformer oil. Moisture content can cause the bub-\nble formation risk in transformer oil when water desorption\nincreases the local concentration of gases in the transformer\noil. Hence, this section presents acidity and moisture mea-\nsurements for oils extracted from the new ﬁve transformers\n(66/11 kV) of oil type (Nytro 10 XN). These were collected\nfrom ELMACO Company, Egypt, during their ﬁrst-year in-\nservice. Another sample extracted from the 13-year in-service\ntransformer was tested.\nUsing volumetric syringes, the samples were taken, and\ntheir moisture and acidity were measured in the Central Lab-\noratory of the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity. Table 11 and\nFig. 12 show the measured acidity and moisture in mg KOH/g\nand ppm, respectively, for the new ﬁve cases and the aged\ncase study.\nTABLE 10. The dissolved gases before and after temperature rise test.\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25965\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nFIGURE 11. Dissolved gases before and after the temperature rise test for five cases of transformers; No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, and No. 5.\nTABLE 11. Acidity and moisture content measurement for five\ntransformer case studies.\nThe acidity measurement showed that mg KOH/g was\nbetween 0.01 and 0.06 for the new ﬁve transformers, less\nthan the maximum limit [45]–[47]. In addition, the moisture\ncontent for the same new ﬁve transformers was 7.5 ppm,\n6.4 ppm, 7.1 ppm, 6.8 ppm, and 6.2 ppm, which has not\nbeen exceeded the limit value [48]. For the 13-years in-\nservice transformer, the acidity and moisture were 0.19 mg\nKOH/g and 12.5 ppm, respectively. These values exceeded\nthe maximum limits due to the diagnosed thermal fault. These\nacidity and moisture measurements can be used to evaluate\nthe health index of the transformer as a diagnosis factor.\nD. HEALTH INDEX OF TRANSFORMER INSULATION\nSYSTEM\nThe transformer Health Index (HI) represents a practical\nmethod to quantify the results of operating observations, ﬁeld\ninspections, and site and laboratory testing into an objective\nand quantitative index, providing the overall health of the\n25966 VOLUME 10, 2022\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nFIGURE 12. Acidity and moisture content measurements for transformer cases; (a) Acidity in mg KOH/g, and (b) Moisture in ppm.\nassets. The HI is helpful in the predictive maintenance plan\nof transformers. This section presented two techniques for\ncalculating the HI of transformer oil. The ﬁrst technique used\nonly DGA for HI calculation, while the second one used DGA\nwith the BDV and typical chemical properties.\n1) HEALTH INDEX OF TRANSFORMER INSULATION SYSTEM\nUSING DGA BEFORE AND AFTER TEMPERATURE RISE TEST\nThe HI of transformer oil can be predicted using the indi-\nvidual DGA approach before and after the temperature rise\ntest. The time interval (t) required for the temperature rise test\nis 3 hours after the top-oil temperature rise is kept within at\nleast 80% of the ﬁnal value in the steady-state condition [43].\nThe Gases Rate Increase (GRI) can be calculated for each gas\naccording to the following equation:\nGRIi =1\nt (G2i −G1i) (16)\nwhere G1i represent the gas concentration before the temper-\nature rise and G2i represent the gas concentration after the\ntemperature rise. GRIs are calculated separately for each gas\nas depicted in Table 12. After that, GRIs are compared with\nadmissible limits of GRIs in IEC 60076-2 [43].\nFor cases No. (1) and (5), the GRIs for CO and CO 2\nexceeded the limits of the ﬁrst series in IEC 60076-2. For\ncases No. (4) and (5), the summation of GRIs for the main ﬁve\ngases H2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and C 2H2 exceeded the limit of\nthe ﬁrst series in IEC 60076-2. Hence, for these three cases,\nthe possibility of local overheating exists. Consequently, it is\nrecommended that oil samples be taken at regular intervals\nfrom the transformer and the gas analysis be performed. For\ncase study No. (3), the values of GRIs fulﬁll all the limits of\nthe ﬁrst series in IEC 60076-2, thereby it may be concluded\nthat the transformer has no possibility of local overheating.\nFor case study No. (2), the values of gases concentration\nreduced after the temperature rise test due to possible atmo-\nspheric leaks. In general, most cases predicted the possible\nexistence of local overheating. After in-service observation\nof these transformers, these results proved that HI calculation\nbased on only DGA is unreliable since no local overheating\noccurred.\n2) HEALTH INDEX OF TRANSFORMERS INSULATION SYSTEM\nUSING BDV, ACIDITY, MOISTURE, AND DGA\nBy using the results of breakdown, DGA, moisture content,\nand acidity, the health index was calculated for the new ﬁve\ntransformer cases and the aged one. The description factor\nfor breakdown, DGA, moisture, and acidity can be computed\naccording to the following equation [25].\nDescription factor (DF) =\n∑n\ni=1 Si ×Wi\n∑n\ni=1 Wi\n(17)\nwhere the score (S i) is an assessment of the testing results of\neach parameter. According to the standards of the testing for\nthese parameters, it can be represented in the form of numbers\nwith ranges. The weight of a parameter (W i) is a factor of\nthe test parameter inﬂuencing a transformer; it can take the\ninteger value for 1 to 5 [47]. According to Table 13, the score\n(Si) and weight factor (W i) of each gas after the temperature\nrise test can be determined for new cases and for an aged one.\nHence, the DGA description factor was calculated. As well,\ncalculation of the description factor for breakdown, moisture\ncontent, and acidity was performed according to Table 14.\nBy calculating the description factor for DGA, acidity, mois-\nture, and dielectric strength according to their scoring and\nweight factor, the rating code and condition can be known\naccording to Table 15. For the new transformer study cases,\nthe average DGA description factor after the temperature rise\ntest can be calculated according to equation (17). Therefore,\nthe rating code was determined. Table 16 shows that for\n(66/11 kV) transformer of NYTRO 10XN oil type. The DFs\nfor DGA were 1, 1.16, 1, 1.11, and 1 for the new ﬁve cases,\nrespectively, giving a rating code (A). The DF for dielectric\nstrength was 1 and the rating code was (A). For all moisture\nand acidity measurements, except acidity of case No. 4, the\nrating code was (A). On the other hand, using equation (17),\nthe DF for the 13 years in-service transformer based on DGA,\ndielectric strength, acidity, and moisture content was 2.88,\n2, 3, and 1 of rating code D, D, E, and A, respectively,\nas showing in Table 16.\nThe rating (A, B, C, D, E) is converted to a factor between\n4 and 0, respectively, called the health index factor (HIF) in\nTable 17. Then, the health index percentage was calculated\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25967\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nTABLE 12. The gases rate increases (GRIS) for the five transformers.\nTABLE 13. Weight factor and scoring for gas level (PPM).\nTABLE 14. Weight factor and scoring for dielectric strength.\nTABLE 15. Transformer rating based on description factor.\naccording to the following equation (18).\nHealth Index % =\n∑n\nj=1 Kj ×HIFj\n4 ∑n\nj=1 Kj\n% (18)\nBy using the DGA, breakdown voltage test, moisture con-\ntent, and acidity measurements of the oil, HI % for new cases\nwas approximately 100%. According to Table 18 [25], the\ncondition was very good; the expected lifetime was more than\n15 years, keeping normal maintenance requirement. For the\naged transformer case with 13 years in-service, HI % was\napproximately 36%. Hence, the aged transformer lifetime is\n3 years with poor condition. With studying the state of trans-\nformers in the service, the health index results using DGA,\nbreakdown, and the measurement of the chemical property\nwas closer to the reality compared to using DGA only.\nIV. DISCUSSIONS\nIn this research, the discussions can be summarized as:\n- For improving the diagnostic accuracy of transformer\nfaults using the DGA approach, a proposed technique\nwas presented. It is based on the integration of ﬁve of\nthe previous DGA methods but with novelty procedures.\nThe proposed technique proved its high accuracy in\n25968 VOLUME 10, 2022\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nTABLE 16. Case study rating based on description factor of DGA and dielectric strength.\nTABLE 17. Scoring of the health index.\nTABLE 18. Health index and transformer expected lifetime.\ndiagnosing faults. The results of this part are based on a\nnumber of datasets that are collected from the Egyptian\nElectricity network and from literature. The diagnostic\naccuracy using the proposed technique was improved\ncompared to the previous techniques.\n- For studying a transformer of rating (66/11 kV), a health\nindex of its insulation system was evaluated using ﬁrstly\nDGA alone, then DGA plus breakdown voltage test,\nmoisture content, and acidity measurement. For this\nobjective, the breakdown test was carried out on the\nstudy case oil type and another oil type as well as a\nmixture of them by 50/50%. Mixing 50% of the two\noil types; NYTRO 10XN and HyV olt III, was slightly\nhigher than pure HyV olt III. But the type of NYTRO\n10XN oil remains the best in terms of dielectric strength.\n- The aim of this section was ﬁrstly to clarify the effect of\nmixing the two types of oils on the dielectric strength to\nconsider the condition that could happen inside the trans-\nformer in the absence of one of these oils. In addition,\nthis breakdown voltage measurements were used to\ncalculate the health index of oil quality of the study\ncases. A secondary, the dissolved gases in oil before and\nafter the temperature rise test were analyzed and com-\npared with each other. The objective of the temperature\nrise test was to determine the oil health index and the\npredicted fault based on the rate of change in dissolved\ngases concentrations before and after the test. A thirdly,\nmoisture and acidity were measured for ﬁve new cases\nand an aged transformer of the same rating. The acidity\nresults were ranged between 0.01 and 0.06 mg KOH/g,\nand moisture measurements were not exceeded 10 ppm.\nAccordingly, a health index was measured using DGA\nalone, then using DGA plus breakdown voltage, acidity,\nand water content. The dissolved gas analysis before and\nafter the temperature rise test predicted the existence of\npossibility for local overheating. While according to the\nbreakdown and DGA results plus chemical properties,\nthe health index was calculated and resulted that the\ninsulation condition was good, expecting lifetime more\nthan 15 years for the new transformers with normal\nVOLUME 10, 2022 25969\nM. Badawiet al.: Reliable Estimation for Health Index of Transformer Oil\nmaintenance requirements. For the aged transformer\ncase with 13 years in-service, the health index results\nthat the aged transformer lifetime is 3 years with poor\ncondition. With studying the state of transformers in\nthe service, the health index results using DGA, break-\ndown, and the measurement of the chemical property\nwas closer to the reality compared to using DGA only.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA proposed combined DGA technique has been presented\nbased on the integration between the results of ﬁve existing\ntechniques used in literature. The new DGA technique had\nan accuracy higher than its constructing techniques as well as\nthe recently published techniques, where the diagnosis accu-\nracy results of the proposed technique were 93.3% for PD\ndiagnosis, 86.3% for D1, 98.2% for D2, 96% for T1, 83.7%\nfor T2, and 98.2 % for T3. Hence, the overall accuracy of\nthe proposed DGA technique improved signiﬁcantly, reach-\ning 93.6%. While the techniques used in constructing this\nproposed technique were 90%, 53.6%, 47.2%, 59.1%, and\n70.8%, respectively. In addition, the accuracy of the recently\npublished four techniques were 63.6%, 89.7%, 76.9%, and\n85.8%, respectively. In addition, new validation datasets (36\ndatasets) have been used for checking the proposed technique\naccuracy. It exhibited a diagnostic accuracy of 91.5%, which\nis a higher value than the construction techniques and the\npreviously published techniques.\nFor transformer study case (11/66 kV), the breakdown\nvoltage test for the transformer oil indicated that; by mixing\n50/50% of two oil types, NYTRO 10XN and HyV olt III,\nthe dielectric strength was slightly improved compared to\nHyV olt III. But the type of NYTRO 10XN oil remains the best\nin terms of dielectric strength. In addition, the temperature\nrise test was carried out on several study cases. The dissolved\ngases before and after the test were analyzed and compared.\nIn addition, winding dc resistance was measured. The most\naffected gases by the temperature rise test were (CO 2, CO,\nand H2). Using DGA, moisture, acidity, and BDV results, the\nhealth index of the transformer insulation system was evalu-\nated using DGA only, and using DGA plus BDV , moisture and\nacidity. By using DGA before and after the temperature rise\ntest, it can expect the probability of local overheating. Though\naccording to the breakdown, DGA, moisture content, and\nacidity results, the health index was computed and indicated\nthat the insulation condition was superior for the new case\nwith an expected lifetime more than 15 years keeping normal\nmaintenance needs. The health index for the aged transformer\ncase indicated that the lifetime is 3 years with poor condition.\nHence, the health index of the transformer oil quality using\nmore than one diagnosis factor is more accurate than using\nonly DGA.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the El-Nasr Transformers &\nElectrical Products Company (ELMACO, Egypt) for accept-\ning to use their laboratory in preparing the experimental\nworks.
