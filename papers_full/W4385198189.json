Here we present an approach that\nidentiﬁes novel chemotype ligands by combining structural data with a random forest agonist/antagonist\nclassiﬁer and a signal-transduction kinetic model. As a test case, we apply this approach to identify novel\nantagonists of the human adenosine transmembrane receptor type 2A, an attractive target against\nParkinson's disease and cancer. The identiﬁed antagonists were tested here in a radio ligand binding\nassay. Among those, we found a promising ligand whose chemotype diﬀers signiﬁcantly from all so-far\nreported antagonists, with a binding aﬃnity of 310± 23.4 nM. Thus, our protocol emerges as a powerful\napproach to identify promising ligand candidates with novel chemotypes while preserving antagonistic\npotential and aﬃnity in the nanomolar range.\nIntroduction\nHuman guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors\n(hGPCRs) represent one of theve protein families commonly\ntargeted by prescription drugs, together with ion channels,\nkinases, nuclear hormone receptors, and proteases.\n1 New\npossibilities for hGPCR drug discovery have emerged exploiting\nthe modulation via allosteric sites, as well as an improved\nunderstanding of receptor activation mechanisms. The former\nenables targeting protein regions, which are less conserved\nbetween family subtypes than the primary binding site, leading\nto signicant specicities.\n2 The latter, knowledge about activa-\ntion mechanisms, can be facilitated manifold in virtual\nscreening to not only identify key residues that can be targeted\nto modulate receptor function,2,3 but also to sample and x\nreceptor conformations to ‘bias’ the signaling pathways asso-\nciated with that subset.4,5 Also, the knowledge of pharmaco-\nlogical cellular-pathway-dependent parameters such as cAMP\naccumulation, calcium ux, ERK phosphorylation, arrestin\nrecruitment, and G-protein interaction is now recognized as key\nto linkin vitrobioactivities within vivoeﬀects.\n4,6\nThese developments are further extended by Quantitative\nSystems Pharmacology (QSP) multi-scale models that combine\ncomputational and experimental methodologies. 7 The drug\nconcentration prole in the blood, the site of action, and\ncellular signaling downstream of the targeted sites are a few\nexamples of the key quantitative and qualitative factors that can\nbe integrated and predicted using such models.\n8,9 QSP can\nclarify, validate, and apply new pharmacological principles to\nthe creation of therapies that relate the kinetics of drug– target\ninteractions to the cellular response that follows in the context\nof the (diseased) physiological state.\nHere, we address the question of whether it is feasible to\ncombine QSP-like approaches and structural data to select\nligands with novel chemotypes, speci cally ligands not\nmimicking natural substrates, that however retain a high\nprobability to activate or inactivate the GPCR, and a promising\ndose-curve response of the relevant pathway.\nAs a test case, we focus on the human Adenosine Receptor\ntype 2A (A\n2AR), an important target for pharmacological inter-\nvention (Fig. 1A). A 2AR is a member of the subclass of\nrhodopsin-like receptors (class A) of G-protein coupled recep-\ntors, for which many functional data (e.g. IC\n50,E C50, Ki, KD) can\naInstitute for Computational Biomedicine (INM-9/IAS-5) Forschungszentrum Jülich,\nWilhelm-Johnen-Straße, 52428 Jülich, Germany.

The ligands, classied as full/partial agonists,\nneutral antagonists, as well as inverse agonists, depending on\nits potential degree of receptor activation,3 can act as pharma-\nceutical therapeutics targeting the A2AR.\n8 of 11 FDA-approved drugs targeting A2AR are antagonists,\nalong with compounds undergoing clinical trials (Fig. 1B).10\nThey are used to treat diﬀerent diseases, mostly symptoms of\nneurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, 11,12 as well as\ncancer.13,14 Although these molecules are chemically diverse\n(Fig. S1†), they all (i) lack the sugar moiety and (ii) feature\na mono-, bi-, or tricyclic structure, which mimics the adenine\npart of adenosine. They are classied as xanthines and non-\nxanthines.\n15\nUnfortunately, the existing antagonistic FDA drugs have\nspecicity issues that limit their eﬃciency for A2A (see caption of\nFig. 1 for further info) and many eﬀorts are made to identify new\nligands. So far, structure-based virtual screening has managed\nto achieve some success in identifying antagonists specic for\nA2A receptors: several of them are active inin vitro and, in one\ncase, in a rat model (see Table 1).24–28\nHowever, three major challenges need to be faced: (i) the\ndiﬃculty to identify antagonists specic for this class of the\nreceptor and not for other adenosine receptor subclasses, such\nas the A\n2B receptors (59% similarity).29 This is crucial to avoid\naﬀecting the function of untargeted subtypes, possibly causing\nside eﬀects.30 (ii) the challenges in eﬃciently predicting the\nactivity of the antagonists. Although there is indeed an\nincreasing amount of activity data, structure– activity model\napproaches are oen hampered by noise due to undersampling:\nmolecules known to be active (or inactive) are outnumbered by\nthe vast amount of possible chemical features that might\ndetermine binding.\n31 (iii) the diﬃculty in predicting their mode\nof action in cellular pathways. Adenosine signaling is indeed\nwidespread in several cascades and ligands acting at these\nFig. 1 (A) The A2AR, like other GPCR, consists of seven transmembrane helices linked by three extra- and intracellular loops (ECL/ICL) and an\namphipathic helical segment (membrane plane represented by the dotted red line).16 The latter lies parallel to the cytoplasmic membrane\nsurface, connecting the membrane domain with its long C-terminal tail. (B) FDA-approved drugs for A2A, antagonists10 (red names) and agonists\n(green names) are highlighted. Antagonists are primarily derivatives of Xanthine (caﬀeine, theophylline, dyphyline, oxtriphylline, enprofylline,\npentoifylline, istradefylline), quinoline (meﬂoquine), triazine (iamotrigine). The xanthines theophylline, caﬀeine, and enprofylline are unfortunately\nrather unspeciﬁc binders, sharing aﬃnity between A2A,A 1 and partly A3.17 Oxtriphylline, the choline salt of Theophylline, and dyphylline share this\nunspeciﬁcity to the AA and are mostly used as inhibitor for phosphodiesterase 4A.18 Pentoxifylline, also a theophylline derivate, shares activity\nbetween A2A and A1 and targets phosphodiesterase enzymes.19 Meﬂoquine is an antimalarial agent used in the prophylaxis and treatment of\nmalaria,20 which is only a moderately selective adenosine A2AR antagonist.21 Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic used to treat some types of epilepsy\nand bipolar disorder, while having estimated aﬃnity for 17 diﬀerent targets.22 Finally, despite suggested improvements,23 istradefylline suﬀers\nfrom poor photostability.23\nTable 1 Comparison among Virtual Screening campaigns with added experiment type for A2AR reported in literature\nTitle Experiment\nIdentication of novel adenosine A2A receptor antagonists by virtual\nscreening24\nRadioligand binding assaysin vitro\nDiscovery of novel dual adenosine A1/A2A receptor antagonists using\ndeep learning, pharmacophore modeling and molecular docking25\ncAMP functional assay and radioligand binding assayin vitro\nDiscovery of novel and selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonists for\ntreating Parkinson's disease through comparative structure-based\nvirtual screening\n26\ncAMP functional assay + rat modelin vitroand in vivo\nStructure-based discovery of novel chemotypes for adenosine A2A\nreceptor antagonists47\nRadioligand binding assays and cAMP + functional assayin vitro\nSubstructure-based virtual screening for adenosine A2A receptor\nligands28\nRadioligand binding assaysin vitro\n8652 | Chem.

However, predicting the eﬀects of A2AR\nantagonists on A2AR cascade is not usually part of virtual\nscreening.32 Similar challenges may be encountered across\nother GPCRs' other than A2AR.\nNovel chemotype antagonists, i.e. not featuring common\nchemical aspects of general antagonists for adenosine recep-\ntors' class and specically tailored to the inactivated structure of\nthe A\n2AR, could be used in principle to solve the problem of\nspecicity, i.e. point (i) above. However, with a novel chemotype,\nit is even more di ﬃcult in virtual screening campaigns to\npredict their activity or antagonist power (i.e. their ability to\ninhibit A2AR), through structure– activity type of modeling, as\ndiscussed in point (ii) above. Furthermore, such antagonist\npower needs in principle to be evaluated in a given cellular\ncascade, i.e. point (iii) above; this is usually beyond the domain\nof applicability of virtual screening campaigns.\nTo nd novel chemotype antagonists (i.e. not resembling\nknown antagonist from A\n2AR), we performed an unbiased virtual\nscreening campaign targeting the inactivated structure of A2AR.\nTo address the issue of predicting antagonistic power of such\nnovel chemotypes, we used machine learning methods (ML),\nwhich are also robust to noisy data.\n35 And, to evaluate the impact\nof the selected antagonist candidates within a given subcellular\npathway, we implemented a in-house QSP approach in the virtual\nscreening pipeline. From one side, ML has indeed emerged as\na very powerful tool in computer-aided drug design.\n36,37 It is able\nto predict drug contrary eﬀects,38 identify new inhibitors,39 and\npredict subclass specicity for ligands of A1 and A2A receptors,40\nand even classify ligands' mode of action for theb2 adrenergic\nreceptor (AR).41 From the other side, QSP approaches like signal\ntransduction models, comparably to ML, have also found exten-\nsive usage in theeld. They are used to modelin vitro cAMP\nresponse curves for the D\n2 dopamine antagonist,42 to optimize\nchimeric constructs that target EGF receptors in terms of selec-\ntivity and eﬃciency,\n43 and used to characterize the bronchodila-\ntory response of a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor.44 These successes\nencouraged us to develop random forest classiers and combine\nit with our recently developed Structural Systems Biology tool45\nwithin a virtual screening pipeline. The rst allowed us to\nimprove decision-making in selecting molecules with a higher\npotential to be antagonist, the second allowed us to predict the\ndose–response curves for the best-scored virtually screened\nantagonist candidates, within the A2AR cascade. In this way, the\nnal candidates selection was enormously improved, with\nrespect to a canonical virtual screening campaign. By testing their\nbinding aﬃnity throughin vitroradio-ligand binding assays, we\nshowed that one of our molecules is indeed an antagonist. The\ncandidate shows a dose–response curve similar to the A\n2A ‘gold\nstandard’ inhibitor named ZM241385,46 which is not only highly\naﬃne (KD = 1.2 nM),47 but also selective for the A2AR subtype.\nAlthough the candidates' aﬃnity is sub-micromolar, its chemo-\ntype diﬀers heavily from those reported in the ChEMBL data-\nbase48 targeting A2A. This proves that QSP-like approaches, AI and\nstructural data are a powerful combination tond novel che-\nmotype molecules with proven antagonistic impact on the\nselected GPCR.\nResults and discussion\nData collection and characterization of known agonists and\nantagonists compounds\nData collection. Currently, (i.e. February 2023) there are 66\nsolved structures of the adenosine receptor type 2A (see Table\nS1†).\n49,50 While 11 structures are bound to an agonist and\nrepresent an intermediate state in between inactive and active\nstate, two structures are crystallized in a full active conforma-\ntion. These full active conformations were achieved by binding\nthe receptor to an engineered G-protein (mini-G\ns) in the case of\nthe X-ray structure with ID 5G53,51 and to an heterotrimeric G-\nprotein (mini-Gs, bg subunits and a nanobody Nb35) with the\nagonist NECA (Fig. 2A, le) in the case of cryo-EM solved\nstructure 6GDG.52 Of the remaining structures, 53 are bound to\nan antagonist, of which 28 are the low nanomolar aﬃnity ligand\nZMA (Fig. 2B, le).\nData characterization: binding patterns di ﬀerences of\nagonists and antagonists in crystal structures.Both agonists\nand antagonists make similar polar interactions between their\nadenine-like moieties with ASN253\n6x55 and GLU169ECL2 (Fig. 2A/\nB, le). The main diﬀerence is given by the fact that agonists\ncontain a ribose group, which extends deeper than ZMA into the\northosteric binding pocket. There, the ribose moiety performs\npolar interactions with the HIS2787x42 and SER2777x41 residues\nin helix 7 and makes hydrophobic contacts with residues in\nhelix 3 through THR88\n3x36. While all co-crystallized ligands\nengage helix 3 and helix 7 through these residues, some\nantagonists do also have interactions with them, but never at\nthe same time.\n53 Lacking these interactions, the inverse agonist\nZMA seems to be capable of preventing a crucial conformational\nchange in helix 5 and, therefore, prevent the transition to the\nactive state of the receptor.54 The ribose or the ribose-like moiety\nis part of the majority of known agonists (Fig. S2†) and increases\nthe aﬃnity at all adenosine receptor subclasses. The substituted\nadenine moiety is mainly harnessed to determine the subtype\nselectivity for the generation of specic subtype agonists.\n54,55\nNon-nucleosidic agonists are in the minority, but they represent\nan alternative to the generally long and complex synthetic route\nfor substituted nucleosides.56 These consist mainly of pyrines or\npyrimidines scaﬀolds and mimic the agonistic interactions of\nadenosine. In the case of A2A agonist BAY-60-6583 a carbox-\namide function is mimicking the ribose-like interactions.57\nSummarizing the crystallographic data, the binding patterns\nthat leads to the inhibition or the activation of the receptor can\nbe very diverse but some key interactions that distinguish\nagonist from antagonist can still be identied: the agonists\nengage with helix 3 (e.g. THR88\n3x36) and helix 7 (e.g. HIS2787x42,\nSER2777x41). Antagonists are less restricted in their explicit\ninteraction prole as long as they block agonist access to the\nresidues mentioned above.\nData enrichment. Next, we added additional molecules to\nthe ensemble of approved drugs and co-crystallized molecules\nby including a library of known agonist/antagonist of the A\n2A.\nThese were collected from GuideToPharmacology, 58 GPCR\ndatabase,50,59,60 ChEMBL,48 and DrugBank10 (Fig. S3,† le for the\n© 2023 The Author(s).

Lacking experimental data for these\nsmall molecules, we estimated the complex conformationvia\nmolecular docking, specically by using Glide docking soware.\nThe protocol includes the following steps: (i) initial docking and\nranking with the HTVS scoring function (ii) dock top 10%\n(highest ranking) for docking with “Single Precision” (SP)\nscoring (iii) dock top 10% (highest ranking) for docking with\n‘Extra Precision’ scoring (XP) (see Methods).\nDistinct diﬀerences between the binding patterns of known\nagonists and antagonists emerged in a similar fashion to the\ncrystal conformations (Fig. 2, right): hydrogen bond donor\ninteractions of SER277\n7x41 and HIS2787x42 are very specict o\nthe agonists poses. The hydrogen bond donor interaction with\nASN253\n6x55 is also far more frequent in agonists' binding poses.\nWhile the ionic interaction with GLU169ECL2 can also be found\nin around 50% of antagonist's poses and in more than 80% of\nthe agonists' poses. Another very distinct feature is the agonist's\nhydrogen bond donor interaction with THR88\n3x36, which is not\nas frequent in the antagonists' poses. This is due to the deep\nplacement in the binding pocket and can therefore only be\nreached by mostly linear antagonists. These interactions are\nsimilar to the ones found in the crystals structures already\npublished for the adenosine receptor and mentioned above.\nMain anchoring interactions are the salt bridges formed with\nGLU169\nECL2 and p– p-stacking (aromatic face– face) interactions\nwith PHE168ECL2 in both active and inactive structures. The\nbiggest di ﬀerences can be observed in the contacts with\nSER2777x41 and HIS278 7x42, which act as hydrogen bond\nacceptors for the ribose-moiety of the agonists. Diﬀerences\nbetween the crystal structure and the docking poses can be\nexplained by the limitations of the docking approach: the\nprotein was kept in one rigid state allowingexibility only for\nthe small molecule binder. Crystallographic e ﬀects, like\ncontacts with the crystal image in the unit cell are also\na possible source of diﬀerent behaviors on passing from the X-\nray to the docked structure. A er con rming di ﬀerences\nbetween agonist and antagonist docking poses, which are\nsimilar to the experimental conformations, the docking poses\nand virtual library of agonists/antagonists was used to build two\nrandom forest classication models.\nFingerprints and random forest classiers\nHaving found distinct di ﬀerences in the docking poses of\nagonists compared to antagonists, we can now make use of this\nnding with a classical machine learning approach: Two\nFig. 2 (A, left) Agonist/(B, left) antagonist binding poses and docking histograms.

One was based on the chemical graph\nrepresentation (extended-circularngerprints) of all the known\nadenosine receptor ligands available (ECFP4 Based Random\nForest). The second one was based upon the interaction\nngerprint of the same library analyzed above, docked to the\nreceptor in an active, inactive and intermediate state of activa-\ntion (PLIF Based Random Forest). Theve-fold cross-validation\nperformance evaluation metrics are listed for both models in\nTable S2 and Fig. S4.† The baseline performance of both the\nclassiers is very high (>0.9 accuracy). Due to the high baseline-\nperformance, hyperparameter optimization was not applied to\navoid overtting eﬀects.\n61 To evaluate which ligand features\n(ECFP4 based) and interactions (PLIF based) are responsible for\nthe decision we analyzed the models by calculating the SHAP\n(SHapley Additive exPlanations)\n62,63 value impacts on the model\noutput (see Methods for further details) of the available data in\nthe following paragraphs.\nFeatures evaluation. The SHAP value of the eight most\nimportant features for the ECFP4 based classier are plotted in\nFig. 3A. Features #190 and #454 are encoding for fragments\ncentered on an ether function and a carbon bound to a hydroxyl\ngroup, respectively (Fig. 3B). Both features are very reminiscent\nof the ribose moiety bound to nucleobase adenine (as found in\nmost agonists, Fig. S2†). Features #1257 and #3535 both show\nfragments of a hydroxyl function needed for hydrogen bond\ninteractions. Features #3314 and #3709 show nitrogens as part\nof an aromatic ring system. These features (including feature\n#2020, which shows a sp\n2 hybridized carbon) can also be found\nin parts of the nucleobase adenine. Lastly feature #3067 shows\nsp3 hybridized carbon, which seems rather unspecic, but is\npresent in all agonists.\nFollowing the same procedure as in the ECFP4 based model,\nthe features importance was analyzed using SHAP values\n(Fig. 3C). The most important features for agonist predictions\nare hydrogen bond interaction with HIS278\n7x42, TYR2717x35 and\nSER2777x41. These interactions are frequently found in the\nknown A2A agonists and mediated mostly by the ribose-like-\nmoiety (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the docking score is the second\nimportant feature for discriminating agonists from antagonists\nFig. 3 (A) Feature importance by SHAP value calculation on training set.

Unsurprisingly, the average\nagonist shows a lower glide docking score in the active state\nreceptor compared to the inactive state (Fig. S5A and B†). The\nligands with the lowest docking scores show to be primarily\nagonists. This observation is mirrored in the SHAP values for\nthe docking score: A low value predicts mostly agonists, while\na mediocre value is more common in the antagonist docking\nposes. Van-der-Waals interactions with PHE168\nECL2 is most\nindicative of the antagonists' poses, as this interaction (paired\nwith an aromatic face– face interaction) is oen used to‘anchor’\nthe aromatic core of most antagonists in the binding pocket.\nAlso, the presence of the LEU249\n6x51-Van-der-Waals interaction\npredicts antagonists. The anchoring interaction performed by\nASN253\n6x55 is also more likely to occur in agonists (Fig. 3D)\nposes compared to the antagonists'. Summarizing, in the\nECFP4-based RF model the existence of ribose- (e.g. #190, #454)\nand adenine-like (e.g., #3314 and #3709) fragments are among\nthe top relevant features for the decision of the model. Instead,\nthe PLIF-based RF model's features are more based upon\ninteractions that are crucial for the activation/inhibition of the\nreceptor (e.g. HIS278\n7x42, TYR2717x35 and SER2777x41), which are\nnot linked intrinsically to a particular chemical structure.\nTherefore, since our scope is tond novel scaﬀolds with\nantagonistic power, we prioritized the PLIF-based classier.\nVirtual screening andltering: selection of molecules for the\nexperimental testing\nAer analysis of the random forest models, the‘Schrodinger's\nVirtual Screening Workow’ (see Methods for details) was used\nfor the screening of 403 716 structures against the crystal\nstructure of A\n2A (PDB_ID: 4EIY34).

All of the top 1% molecules (307) selected by virtual\nscreening show a high average probability to be antagonists by\nthe PLIF-based RF classier. Therefore, we chose to neglect\nmolecules with a probability lower than 0.84.\nFilter 2: predicting dose –response curves using systems\nbiology simulations. We have used an in-house developed\nStructural Systems Biology (SSB) approach\n45 to simulate the\nsignaling pathway (or cascade) of the Adenosine 2A receptor to\nreproduce, in silico, the subcellular dynamics of cAMP upon\nligand-target binding. The aim was to obtain the predicted\ndose– response curves from the Systems Biology (SB) simula-\ntions to rank qualitatively the potency of the twelve most\npromising molecules obtained from the virtual screening.

We clustered the molecules according to their\nECFP4 ngerprint to nd a most diverse subset of molecules\n(see Methods). Specically, the extended circularngerprints\nwere generated and the pairwise Tanimoto similarity between\nthe molecules was used to construct a distance matrix (Fig. S7†\nfor a TSNE visualization). The latter was used for hierarchical\nclustering and we chose 90 clusters based on silhouette score.\n66\nOf the diﬀerent clusters thenal molecules were chosen by\nvisual inspection, comparing the docking pose to the crystal\nligand ZMA and showing favorable interactions with the\nreceptor. In Fig. 4A thenal selection of molecules' 2D struc-\ntures is shown with the corresponding dose– response curves;\nalthough all the molecules show predicted behaviors in the high\nmicro to low-nanomolar range (Fig. 4B), we can see that there is\na distinct di ﬀerence between the rst (JG_03) and last\ncompound (JG_10).\nBinding experiments and inducedt docking\nThe binding aﬃnity of the compounds visible in Fig. 4A were\ntested in competition experiments against the radio ligand ZMA\n(Fig. 5A and S8†).

Both are backbone\ninteractions with the peptidic nitrogens of PHE168\nECL2 and\nGLU169ECL2 at distances of 2.8 and 2.2 Å respectively.

In this work, we have\nfocused on the A\n2AR. Specically, two random forest models were\nbuilt by learning from antagonists and agonists found in literature\nto lter out agonistic binding patterns. One was based on the\nchemical graph representation (extended-circularngerprints,\nECFP4) of all the known adenosine receptor ligands available in\npublicly available databases. The second one on an interaction\nngerprint of the same library docked to the receptor in an active,\ninactive and intermediate state of activation. While both models\naccurately classify the available data, they diﬀer in their underlying\nrepresentations. The ECFP4-based model is built on well-\nestablished chemical space. In contrast, the PLIF-based model\ncaptures subtle features of protein-ligand interactions that chem-\nical graph-based approaches may only partially represent. We\nchose to use the PLIF model to explore novel chemical space and\npotentially discover new ligands that are not limited by the explicit\nchemical structure in the training set. The RF classier predicts the\nligands to be antagonists with a high probability. Next, the dose–\nresponse curves of the most promising compounds were predicted\nusing an in-house developed Structural Systems Biology (SSB)\napproach, further guiding the compound selection. Thenal\nselection found by the virtual screening pipeline applied in this\nwork was validated with anin vitro radio ligand binding assay\nexperiments by our collaborators. One of the compounds JG-10 has\ns h o w na naﬃnity (K\nI) of 310 ± 23.4 nM. The most promising\ncompound has a distinct chemotype compared to the most similar\nmolecule of the ChEMBL database (T\nc (ECFP4) = 0.33). The\nprocedure described here could be applied straightforwardly to\nother GPCRs and even other types of membrane receptors.\nLimitations\nAlthough our SB approach is able to simulate dose–response curves\nand predict qualitatively the most potent ligand comparable with\nexperimental data, one should keep in mind that the model was\ndeveloped based on a previous model tuned in order to mimic\nspecic experimental data for other GPCR.\n68 Here, future improve-\nments of our model should involvetting of kinetic constants to\nexperimental data obtained for the A2A receptor signaling pathway.\nMoreover, one should also take in mind that not only we used the\naﬃnity values as an exclusive parameter to calculate the fraction of\nactivated receptors, but also that docking scores and experimental\nbinding aﬃnities are still poorly correlated.\nEven though the aﬃnity of the ligand to the A\n2A is conrmed\nin experiment, there are several additional experiments needed\nto conrm the ligand selectivity by measuring the a ﬃnity\ntowards other subtypes of the adenosine receptor such as the\nA\n2B receptor. Also, the mode of action of the ligands predicted\nby our model was not explicitly measured in a functional assay.\nNevertheless, the implementation of prediction of dose –\nresponse curves using structure systems biology approaches\nwithin virtual screening campaigns, might support, in future,\nrational drug design projects.\nMaterials and methods\nData preparation andngerprint generation\nThe interaction ngerprints were generated with an in-house-\npython script utilizing the interactionngerprint implementa-\ntion of the ODDT module.67 The interactionngerprint captures:\n(i) whether hydrophobic residues are in contact with the ligand; (ii)\nwhether aromatic residues are oriented face to face; (iii) whether\naromatic residues are oriented edge to face; (iv) whether a residue\nprovides hydrogen bond acceptor(s); (v) whether a residue provides\nhydrogen bond donor(s); (vi) whether the residue provides\nhydrogen bond acceptor(s); (vi) whether a residue provides a salt\nbridge (protein positively charged); (vii) whether a residue provides\na salt bridge (protein negatively charged); (viii) whether a residue\nprovides a salt bridge (ionic bond with metal-ion). Additionally, to\nthe 8 bits of the PLIF for each molecule, the Glide SP docking score\nwas input for the algorithm.\nRandom forest classier training and evaluation\nWe used Schrödinger's ligprex protonation state for the gath-\nered molecules from A\n2A specic binders from Guide-\nToPharmacology,58 GPCR database, 50,59,60 ChEMBL,48 and\nDrugBank10 molecules at pH 7.\nFor the PLIF based random forest classier, we considered\nthe best-scored ve binding poses of each molecule docked to\nthe three receptors (4EIY,34 5G53 (ref. 51) and 2YDO54) species to\naddress the challenge of the docking approach to select the\nmost physiological-like conformation.\n69\nThe models' performance was evaluated by a cross-validation\nstrategy. A 5-fold cross validation strategy was applied, in which\nscikit-learn's StratiedGroupKFold method was used to ensure\nno molecule pose was present in the training or the test splits.\nModel performance was evaluated by calculating the precision\n(eqn (1)), recall (eqn (2)), andF\n1 metric (eqn (3)), which are\ndened below as implemented in the scikit-learn python\npackage. For the overall performance, the accuracy is also\ncalculated (eqn (4)). While precision is the ability of the classi-\ner not to label as positive a sample that is negative, recall is the\nability of the classier to nd all the positive samples. TheF\n1\ncan be understood as the harmonic mean between precision\nand recall and evaluates overall performance. The area under\nthe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is calculated\nby sklearn’ ROC AUC score function. The information about the\nplotted curve is therefore condensed into one value by calcu-\nlating the area under the roc curve.\nPrecision ¼\nTP\nTP þ FP (1)\nRecall ¼ TP\nTP þ TN (2)\nF1 ¼ 2 /C2 precision /C2 recall\nprecision þ recall (3)\nAccuracy ¼ TP þ TN\nTP þ TN þ FP þ FN (4)\n8658 | Chem.

We deleted intracellular\nloop 3 with apocytochrome b(562)RIL (residues 1001– 1106), as\nit was added to improve crystallization. Additionally, all waters\nbeyond 5 Å distance to all HET groups denoted in the PDB-le\nand all Ligands except for ZM241385 were deleted. Hydrogens\nwere added and bond orders were assigned using the Chem-\nical Component Dictionary (CCD) database.\n70 Schrödingers\n“Protein Preparation Wizard” was then used to generate the\ntautomeric states of all protein HET groups at a pH of 7± 2.\nWe added missing side chain a toms and optimized their\nconformations to the residues GLN148 ECL2, GLU161 ECL2,\nARG2206x22 and ARG293 8x48 with Schrödinger's Prime\nprogram.71 Aer optimization of the hydrogen bond orienta-\ntions, all waters with less than 3 H-bonds to non-waters were\ndeleted and the structure was minimized with the OPLS3 force\neld.\n72 Convergence was assumed to be reached a er the\nR M S Dw a se q u a lo rs m a l l e ra s0 . 3 0 .W eu s e d“Schrödingers\nGlide Virtual Screening Work ow” for the screening.
