Here we show that tool use in these birds is facilitated \nby an unusual visual-field topography and bill shape. Their visual field has substantially greater \nbinocular overlap than that of any other bird species investigated to date, including six non-\ntool-using corvids. Furthermore, their unusually straight bill enables a stable grip on tools, and \nraises the tool tip into their visual field’s binocular sector. These features enable a degree of tool \ncontrol that would be impossible in other corvids, despite their comparable cognitive abilities. \nTo our knowledge, this is the first evidence for tool-use-related morphological features outside \nthe hominin lineage. \n1 School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. 2 Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road,  \nOxford OX1 3PS, UK. † Present address: School of Biology, University of St Andrews, Sir Harold Mitchell Building, St Andrews KY16 9TH, UK.  \n*These authors are joint senior authors.

Humans possess several morphological \nfeatures that aid their precise handling and deployment of \ntools, including a powerful visual system for accurate relative depth \nperception1, and hands with opposable thumbs for a secure grip2,3. \nComparatively few non-human animal species are known to use \ntools in the wild 4, and it remains unknown whether any of them \nbenefit from similar morphological predispositions or adaptations.\nNew Caledonian crows Corvus moneduloides (‘NC crows’ here-\nafter) use tools for extractive foraging 5, exhibiting a remarkable \ndegree of dexterity. Using their bills, these tropical birds craft com-\nplex tools from sticks, leaf edges and other materials, before insert-\ning them into deadwood or vegetation to ‘fish’ for invertebrate prey6. \nIn this study, we show that NC crows present at least two unusual \nmorphological features that combine to facilitate their use of tools: \nextreme binocular vision and an uncharacteristically straight bill. \nTaken together, these adaptations enable a secure grip and accurate \nvisual guidance of the tool, even when probing into narrow holes.\nResults\nVisual-field topography . We measured visual-field parameters \n(monocular, binocular and cyclopean fields) and eye-movement \namplitudes in 18 alert subjects from 6 Corvus species (Figs 1 and 2  \nand Table 1), using a well-established ophthalmoscopic reflex \ntechnique7. NC crows had a mean (  ± s.e.m.) maximum binocular \noverlap of 61.5°  ± 0.2 ( n = 3), which is much greater (by between \n14.8° and 23.9°; see Table 1) than that observed in the five non-\ntool-using Corvus species examined in this study, and a previously \nreported value for American crows C. brachyrhynchos8. This striking \ndegree of binocularity appears to be at least partly due to unusually \nlarge eye-movement amplitudes ( Table 1). The average maximum \nbinocular field width of NC crows exceeded that of other Corvus \nspecies over 140° of elevation, spanning from the bill tip to behind \nthe head (Fig. 1).\nAn exhaustive review of previously published material on avian \nvisual fields yielded comparative data for 46 bird species across 19 \norders (Supplementary Table S1). NC crows exhibited consider -\nably larger maximum binocular overlap than all other passerines \n(Corvus species excluded) and all non-passerines in this database  \n(Fig. 2, Table 1, Supplementary Table S1), exceeding the highest  \nspecies values by 10.5° and 13.5°, respectively.\nVisual control during tool deployment . To examine the hypoth -\nesis that the unusual visual-field topography of NC crows supports  \ntheir tool-use behaviour, we conducted behavioural experiments \nwith three wild-caught subjects.

It should be imagined that the bird’s head is positioned at the centre of the transparent sphere, with the bill tip and \nfield boundaries projected onto the surface of the sphere. Estimated tool-projection angles are plotted onto the spheres, to examine to what degree the  \nsix different species can potentially rely on visual feedback of tool-tip position during tool deployment. only in the nC crow do the tool-projection angles \nfall completely within the binocular sector, such that the contralateral eye is able to see along the tool (cf. Fig. 4).\nARTICLE    \n\u0018\nnATuRE CommunICATIons | DoI: 10.1038/ncomms2111\nnATuRE CommunICATIons | 3:1110 | DoI: 10.1038/ncomms2111 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

During stick-tool use, NC crows \ntypically hold the tool in their bill tip, with the non-working end \nof the tool either held against one cheek (‘angled’ grip; Fig. 4a, and \nposition 1 in Fig. 4b) or inside the bill (‘straight’ grip; position 2 in  \nFig. 4b)9,10. We found that, when the aperture of the experimen -\ntal hole was large enough for both eyes to see into, our subjects \nstrongly preferred an angled grip over a straight grip (generalized \nlinear mixed model (GLMM), comparison between large and small \naperture: n = 118 trials, 3 individuals, z =  − 6.78, P < 0.001). In this \nconfiguration, the species’ extensive binocular overlap enables a \nbird to look directly along the shaft of the tool with the eye contral-\nateral to the tool projection (that is, using the eye on the same side as \nthe cheek against which the tool is secured; Fig. 4b), which is better \npositioned than the ipsilateral eye to maintain visual contact with \nthe tool tip; meanwhile, the tool tip will lie closer to the central opti-\ncal axis of the ipsilateral eye (that is, further from the limits of the \nretina). When the aperture of the hole was experimentally reduced \nin size, so that only one eye could see into the tube, our subjects pro-\nportionately increased the use of angled grips (for GLMM results, \nsee above), which position both eyes equidistant to the line of the \ntool, bringing the eye that is ipsilateral during the angled grip closer \nto the tool (Figs 3 and 4b). In interspersed control trials, where the \ntube had a visual aperture large enough for both eyes to see into, \nbut a small physical opening, our crows used an angled grip more \nfrequently than a straight grip in comparison with the small aper -\nture (GLMM: z =  − 2.99, P = 0.003), although this was still a lower \nproportion of angled grips than that observed for the large aperture \n(GLMM: z =  − 4.37, P < 0.001). This shows that the visual properties \nof a hole alone are sufficient to determine the tool grip used by NC \ncrows while probing.\nTaken together, our behavioural experiments suggest that,  \nas visual hole apertures become smaller, NC crows shift their grip  \nto bring the (formerly) ipsilateral eye closer to the tool, enabling  \nit to maintain visual contact with the tool tip. Further behavioural \ntesting would be necessary to establish whether NC crows are  \nable to utilize their large binocular fields for stereoscopic depth \nperception, which may be useful for gauging distances during tool \ndeployment11.\nBill shape and tool-projection angles. We next combined our vis-\nual-field data with morphometric measurements, to assess whether \nany of our non-tool-using Corvus study species could, theoretically, \nachieve levels of physical and visual tool control similar to those \ninferred for NC crows. Tools can be securely held in the bill in several  \nways (Fig. 4b). In addition to the two principal modes described \nabove, crows could hold stick tools perpendicular to the bill axis \n(position 3 in Fig. 4b), so that the working tip of the tool can be \npositioned in a region covered by the visual field of the respective \nipsilateral eye. However, such a grip positions the line of the tool \nfurther from the eye than an angled, or straight, grip (positions \n1 and 2 in Fig. 4b), making this grip less suitable for foraging in \nsmall holes (in Fig. 4b, an angled grip allows visual feedback from a \nhole aperture approximately five times smaller than a perpendicu -\nlar grip). Intermediate angles between perpendicular and angled \ngrips rely on the ipsilateral eye, and would therefore require an even \nlarger aperture than a perpendicular grip. We modelled possible \ntool-projection angles that achieved, simultaneously, a stable tool \ngrip, and the most direct view along the tool shaft. Each species’ \nsagittal tool-projection angle was calculated from the angle of the \nmaxilla where it intersects the mandibula at the bill tip (angle α in \nFig. 5). In NC crows, this angle brings the tool into an approximately \nhorizontal position below the eye where the non-working end of the \ntool can rest against the cheek (see above), presumably improving  \nlateral stability during tool use. The curved bill characteristic of \nnon-tool-using corvids12, on the other hand, results in significantly \nlower-elevation tool-projection angles ( Table 1), which conse -\nquently raises the non-working end of the tool above the eye where \nit cannot be secured against the cheek. Tools held by NC crows are \nestimated to project ‘above’ the bill tip (note that, similar to visual-\nfield parameters, sagittal tool-projection angles were measured \nagainst the line connecting the bill tip and eye, which provides an \nunambiguous reference; compare Figs 4a and 5), which is consistent \nwith observations of natural tool-projection angles5,9,10. In contrast, \ntools held by all other investigated Corvus species would fall below \nthe bill tip (Fig. 1).\nWe also modelled transverse tool projections in each species \nwhen the tool is gripped in the bill tip at an angle as close to the eye \nas possible ( Figs 4 and 5), taking into account eye separation and \n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nNC crow\nCarrion crow\nJackdaw\nPied crow\nRaven\nRook\nPasserines\nNon-passerines\nMaximum binocular overlap (degrees)\nCorvus spp.\nAmerican crow\nSpecies means\nFigure 2 | Maximum binocular overlap in tool-using NC crows and \nnon-tool-using control species.

Superimposing these tool projections on our estimated \ntopographic maps of binocular fields revealed that, in contrast to \nresults obtained for straight-billed NC crows, the curved maxilla of \nnon-tool-using corvids forces the hypothetical tool into a position \noutside of their respective visual fields (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Curved \nbills are thought to assist the visual inspection of the contents of  \nthe open bill in crow species probing in the ground or in car -\ncasses12,13, suggesting that the NC crow has forgone this ability in \nfavour of a bill shape that is suited to gripping and visually guiding \ntools. The rook C. frugilegus, a species that does not habitually use \ntools in the wild, has recently been shown to be a capable tool user \nin captivity14. Interestingly, our comparative results show that the \nrooks’ ability to see along a tool is better than that of other non-\ntool-using crows, as a consequence of its moderate bill curvature \n(compare Figs 1 and 5). However, we note that the rooks used in \nearlier experiments14 extracted bait from a transparent apparatus, \nso the limitations of their visual field could not be assessed. We sug-\ngest that future work further explores the envelope of conceivable \ntool grips, and resulting tool-projection angles, and cross-validates \nresults with captive birds.\nDiscussion\nWe have presented a body of comparative data on the visual-field \ntopography and bill morphology of six Corvus species, including: \nmeasurements from live, but restrained, birds; behavioural experi -\nments with freely moving, naturally behaving NC crows; results \nfrom an exhaustive reanalysis of previously published data; and 3D \ntopographical maps parameterized with measurements taken from \nlive and museum specimens. Taken together, these multiple lines \nof investigation provide strong evidence that, perhaps uniquely \namong non-human animals 15,16, NC crows possess morphologi -\ncal features that support tool-use behaviour. Although an earlier \nstudy had asserted that the visual-field topography of American \ncrows may facilitate their ‘rudimentary tool use’ 8, this claim is \nclearly unsupported by current evidence, as tool use has so far only \nbeen observed once in a single wild subject in this species 17. In any \ncase, the mean maximum binocular overlap of the American crow’s  \nvisual field is much smaller than that observed in habitually tool-\nusing NC crows, and falls well within the range of values obtained \nfor the other non-tool-using Corvus species investigated in our \nstudy (Fig. 2, Table 1).\nIt is currently impossible to establish causal relationships, \nbecause the number of tool-using bird species is insufficient  \nfor broad comparative analyses, and the current lack of NC crow \n(sub-)fossils prevents dating of key evolutionary events 6. In other \nwords, it remains an open question whether ancestors of NC crows \npossessed morphological features that predisposed them to tool \nmanufacture and use, or whether tool-use behaviour was expressed \nfirst due to unusual ecological opportunities, before exerting selec -\ntion pressures that gradually shaped the species’ visual system and \nbill morphology6. Evidence that unusual ecological conditions have \nbeen major drivers in the evolution of habitual tool use is provided \nby detailed analysis of the foraging ecology of wild NC crows 6,18,19 \nand woodpecker finches Cactospiza pallida20, and the experimen -\ntal results for rooks (see above). These avian study systems promise  \nvaluable, phylogenetically independent comparisons with the  \nhominin lineage, where the evolution of opposable thumbs and  \nflexible wrists in humans has enabled precision pinching and \nunprecedented tool-handling capabilities2–4,15,16,21.\nMethods\nVisual-field measurements. We used a well-established ophthalmoscopic reflex \ntechnique to measure visual-field parameters (monocular, binocular and cyclopean \nfields) and eye-movement amplitudes in 18 alert subjects across 6 Corvus species \n(Table 1). This technique has been used in excess of 30 years on 46 bird species of \ndifferent phylogeny, ecology and behaviour, permitting standardized interspecific \ncomparisons7. The procedure is non-invasive and follows guidelines established by \nthe United Kingdom’s Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986) and the Animal \nWelfare Act (2006).\nTo locate subjects suitable for experimentation, we conducted an extensive \nsearch, using both our personal contacts and information found on the internet. \nWe considered all species of the genus Corvus, and our final sample (Table 1) \nreflects what could be achieved within the logistical constraints of our study. All \nexperimental subjects were captive animals in the UK, Germany or Austria, with \nthe exception of two ravens that were caught near the Konrad Lorenz Research Sta-\ntion in Grünau, Austria, as part of an ongoing field project. These two individuals  \nwere released back into the wild immediately after testing and marking. All other \nsubjects were immediately returned to their home aviaries once measured.\nEach bird was held securely in a foam rubber cradle using fabric hook-and-\nloop fastener straps that wrap upon themselves (Supplementary Fig. S1). The feet \nand legs were carefully tucked away beneath the bird, and the head was held in \nposition with a bill-holder at the centre of a visual perimeter. To ensure a comfort-\nable fit for the birds, we created species-specific bill-holders, using calibrated \ndorsal and lateral photographs of the heads of specimens from the Natural History \nMuseum in Tring, UK (see below). Holders were made from aluminium and \nPolycaprolactone (thermoplastic, brand name: ‘Polymorph’) that could be moulded \nTable 1 | Visual-field parameters for seven Corvus species and other birds.\nSpecies N Maximum binocular \noverlap\nMaximum eye-\nmovement amplitude\nTransverse  \ntool-projection  \nangle relative to  \nbill tip\nEstimated overlap \nbetween visual field \nand tool projection\nnC crow C. moneduloides 3 61.5°  ± 0.24 38.8°  ± 1.64 7.3°  ± 3.03 3.9°  ± 2.84\nCarrion crow C. corone 5 37.6°  ± 1.65 27.3°  ± 3.53  − 17.3°  ± 2.52  − 11.2°  ± 4.47\nJackdaw C. monedula 3 45.7°  ± 1.03 26.5°  ± 2.02  − 16.9°  ± 2.22  − 5.3°  ± 0.28\nPied crow C. albus 1 46.2° 32.5°  − 24.8°  − 2.3°\nRaven C. corax 3 43.2°  ± 2.40 22.2°  ± 2.74  − 30.7°  ± 2.20  − 5.8°  ± 2.10\nRook C. frugilegus 3 46.7°  ± 1.81 29.2°  ± 1.86  − 12.2°  ± 1.19  − 1.4°  ± 0.17\nAmerican crow8 C. brachyrhynchos 9 42.0° ca.27°  ± ca. 1\nPasserine species \n(excluding Corvus \nspp.)\n7 35–51°\nnon-passerine \nspecies\n38 10–48°\nmaximum binocular overlap, maximum eye-movement amplitude and relative positioning of tool-projection angles with regards to visual-field boundaries.\nData are shown (as mean ± s.e.m., or otherwise as range) for tool-using nC crows, five non-tool-using Corvus species, and other bird species (cf.

Each holder took account of the \nsize and shape of the bill of the species being measured, and was further adjusted \nto fit individual subjects. The bill was held closed during experiments. Although \nsubjects had to be restrained for 30–45 min, they could have been released from \nthe apparatus immediately if they had shown any signs of distress (this was never \nnecessary).\nFor consistency, all visual-field measurements were made by the same experi-\nmenter (J.T.). The visual perimeter uses a conventional latitude and longitude \nsystem, with the equator aligned vertically at the angle between the eye and bill \ntip. The head is positioned so that the angle of the bill to the horizontal approxi-\nmates that which the bird adopts spontaneously when held in the hand. Subjects’ \neyes were examined with an ophthalmoscope held against a perimeter arm, and \nlongitudinal positions were recorded to  ± 1°. We established that the eyes of all \nsubjects were mobile and could move independently. We determined the limits of \nthe visual field, and the amplitude of eye movements, using the following proce-\ndure. The maximum and minimum longitudinal limits of the retinal visual field \nwere measured in each eye at 10° ( ± 1°) intervals of elevation (latitude). The limit \nof the visual field was determined by the projection of the limit of the retina, the \nora serrata. This can be seen as a clear difference between the bright reflection from \nthe retinal surface and the black of the ciliary folds. Because of eye movements, \nhowever, the visual projection of these limits is not fixed, so we recorded the maxi-\nmum and minimum limits of the visual field at each elevation. These were defined \nby the positions that the retinal margins spontaneously adopted when the eyes \nwere fully rotated ‘forward’ (converged) and ‘backward’ (diverged). To map these \npositions, successive measurements of the projection of the retinal margin at each \nelevation were made in quick succession, and the maximum and minimum values \nwere recorded. The amplitude of eye movements at each elevation was taken as \nthe difference between these maximum and minimum values. Eye movements are \ncomplex rotational movements, but our procedure enabled us to measure explicitly \nany consequent translational effects on the limits of the visual field at each eleva-\ntion. At some elevations, eye movements made little discernible difference to \nthe position of the field margins, whereas at other elevations, effects were more \npronounced. Owing to inevitable obstruction by the holding apparatus, which \nvaried in size across species (see above), visual-field parameters were measured \ndown to different elevations in the lower part of the frontal field in different species \n(Fig. 1). To the rear of the head, measurements were typically possible down to the \nhorizontal plane. We also measured the optic axis of each eye (the line along which \nthe cornea’s and the lens’ refractive surfaces are centred) by recording the perimeter \ncoordinates at which the first and second Purkinje images (reflections from the \ncornea’s and from the lens’ anterior surface) of a point source of light held close to \nthe line of sight were most closely aligned.\nTo calculate the true angles of visual-field limits, rather than the angles \nobserved from the perimeter arm of the apparatus, we had to account for the  \nseparation of each individual’s eyes at the centre of the apparatus (320 mm from  \nthe perimeter arm). Angles measured from the perimeter arm were corrected  \nfrom a hypothetical viewpoint to infinity from the nodal point of each eye7.  \nNodal separation was calculated from the distance between the cornea of each  \neye (measured from standardized and scaled digital photographs of the head of \neach subject held in the apparatus), and the divergence of the optic axes. This \nmakes the assumption that the fundus (posterior portion of the eye) is semicircular \nand that the eyes meet in the sagittal plane of the skull. From these data we  \nconstructed a 3D topographical map of each species’ visual fields, and assessed  \nhow field boundaries were affected by eye movements (see above). Importantly,  \nour measurements for multiple subjects of the same species enabled us to compute \nspecies means and their associated s.e.m. for delineating field boundaries (Fig. 1). \nThis demonstrated that the degree of variation for boundaries was comparable \nacross species, and that effect sizes in our comparisons of NC crows with the  \nfive other Corvus species substantially exceeded this intraspecific variation.  \nRetinal reflection\nTool\nBait\nFigure 3 | Filming eye movements and tool-positioning in free-moving \nNC crows. (a) single frame, shot with an infrared ophthalmoscope video \ncamera, showing a crow using an angled tool grip, and (b) its schematic \ninterpretation. The retinal reflection shows that the visual field of the \ncontralateral eye embraces the tool-projection angle and that vision is not \nobstructed by the bill. The figure also shows that, in this instance,  \nthe ipsilateral eye cannot see the tool tip, highlighting the trade-off \nbetween various eye positions; whereas our behavioural experiments \n(see main text) indicate that the ipsilateral eye may be used preferentially \n(perhaps due to optical quality gains), the contralateral eye is able to \nprovide more consistent coverage. The tube has a 35-mm diameter,  \nwhich is considerably larger than most natural hole apertures19, but small \nenough to prevent the entire head from entering the tube.

(a) nC crows often hold \ntools using the tip of their bill, with the non-working end resting against \nthe cheek, which presumably provides lateral stability9,10.

Holding the tool perpendicular \nto the bill (position 3) brings the tool tip into the field of the ipsilateral \neye (green lines). The straight grip (position 2) allows either or both eyes \nto look along the tool. An angled grip (position 1) brings the tool into the \nfield of the contralateral eye (red lines), allowing the contralateral eye \nto see into far smaller apertures than the ipsilateral eye. owing to these \ngeometric constraints, the hole aperture required for a clear view when \nholding the tool perpendicular to the bill (position 3) is approximately five \ntimes greater than that required in the angled grip position (position 1).\nARTICLE\n\u0018\b\nnATuRE CommunICATIons | DoI: 10.1038/ncomms2111\nnATuRE CommunICATIons | 3:1110 | DoI: 10.1038/ncomms2111 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.\nThe maximum width of the frontal binocular field (that is, maximum binocular \noverlap) was determined on the basis of mean values (see Table 1), to facilitate \ninterspecific comparisons and functional interpretations based on the species’ \nrespective foraging ecologies.\nCollation of previously published visual-field data for reanalysis. We attempted \nto collate all previously published data on the maximum binocular overlap in avian \nvisual fields, using a research database that had been built up over the past 30 years \n(by G.R.M.) as well as systematic keyword searches (‘bird* AND visual field*’ , \n‘bird* AND visual-field’ , ‘avian AND visual field*’ and ‘avian AND visual-field*’)  \nin the ‘Web of Knowledge’ (Thompson Reuters) (Supplementary Table S1; this \nsearch was completed on 15 April 2010).\nMeasurement of hypothetical tool-projection angles. We calculated the average \nsagittal tool-projection angle for each species from scaled macrophotographs taken \nof museum specimens (NC crow, n = 3; carrion crow, n = 5; jackdaw, n = 3; raven, \nn = 4; rook, n = 3) and/or directly from the experimental subject where possible, \nthat is, when the bill tip was not obscured by the bill holder (pied crow, n = 1; rook, \nn = 1). Although there are a number of conceivable ways in which a bird could  \nhold a stick tool in its bill (three principal positions are schematically illustrated \nin Fig. 4b), we chose to model an angled grip in the bill tip that would optimize \nthe contralateral eye’s alignment with the tool shaft (position 1 in Fig. 4b) and \npresumably grant the greatest visual feedback during extractive tool use. Three \nassistants, who were blind with regards to the hypotheses under investigation, were \nindependently shown a standardized and scaled photograph of each specimen on \na computer screen, in a randomized order, and without reference to the species’ \nidentities. They were asked to locate the centre of the eye in each image and to \nposition a circle, scaled to a 2-mm radius, where the tip of the mandibula intersects \nthe tomium maxillare (the red circle in Fig. 5; for terminology, see Fig. 5). Next, \nthey were asked to draw a radius from the centre of the bill-tip circle and rotate \nit clockwise from the 6-o’ clock position until it touched the lowest point of the \ntomium, then repeat anti-clockwise. The average angle of the two radii was used \nto estimate sagittal tool-projection angles if each individual were to hold a tool \nin their bill tip (angle α in Fig. 5). Each experimental subject’s mean transverse \ntool-projection angle was measured from the line between the bill tip and the outer \nedge of the centre of each eye relative to the left-right axis. The overlap between \nthe transverse tool-projection angle and the limit of the subject’s visual field at the \nelevation closest to the mean sagittal tool-projection angle of its species was then \ncalculated (angle β in Fig. 5) to model each subject’s ability to see parallel to the \nshaft of the tool.\nBehavioural experiments. To film the eyes of unrestrained, naturally behaving \nNC crows during extractive foraging, we built a high-definition infrared ophthal-\nmoscope from a commercial HD video camera (Sanyo Xacti HD2; 30 progressive \nframes per second; resolution 1280×780 pixels). The infrared-absorbing filter fitted \nto the camera’s sensor was removed, and replaced with an infrared-transparent,  \nvisual spectrum-transparent filter made from acrylic. A film of reflective/\ntransparent (50%/50%) mirror was used to align an infrared light-source with  \nthe camera’s view, thus converting the system into an ophthalmoscope. Birds are \nnot expected to be able to see the >750-nm wavelength output of the infrared \nophthalmoscope, or through the opaque filter, which had a 720-nm cutoff22. Three \nwild-caught NC crows were housed temporarily in a field aviary (3×3×2 m) where \nthey were given the opportunity to use supplied stick tools to extract beef-heart \npieces from a horizontal tube, with the ophthalmoscope filming from the distal  \nend (Fig. 3). The first subject (A) was a female that was housed alone, and the two \nothers (B and C) were a male and female of unknown relationship, housed with  \na juvenile they were feeding (but which did not participate in experiments). All \nthree subjects had a dark-colour gape, suggesting they were adults19.\nThe tube had a diameter of 35 mm, which was wide enough for crows to see the \nmeat reward with both eyes simultaneously. Subjects were supplied with straight, \n21 cm-long bamboo sticks, to standardize tool dimensions in experimental trials. \nPieces of beef heart (ca. 1 cm3) were presented at a depth of 20 cm from the tube \nopening where they could not be reached by bill alone. Three experimental condi-\ntions were used: large aperture—the tube was left open so that both eyes could see \nthe reward while probing (35-mm opening); small aperture—an opaque plate was \nfitted over the opening of the tube with a 20-mm diameter hole, preventing both \neyes from seeing the reward simultaneously; and control—a transparent plate was \nfitted over the end of the tube with a 20-mm diameter hole to combine the physical \nobstruction of the small aperture, with the visual properties of the large aperture. \nAs all plates were transparent to infrared, our ophthalmoscope could be used \nto film crow behaviour in all experimental conditions (that is, even through the \nopaque plate).\nWe conducted a total of 118 trials across all subjects (crow A, n = 80; crow B, \nn = 10; crow C, n = 28), with all three conditions presented in a semi-randomized \norder within birds. Both eyes were consistently in a forward position whenever \nthey were visible across all subjects and trials. Grip type was categorized into right \nor left grip (tool projecting to the right or left of the bill), or central (tool projecting \nstraight into the bill). Footage was scored in a frame-by-frame analysis by the same \nobserver (J.T.), noting each change of grip and duration of grip. A total of 747 \ntool grips were recorded (of which 479 were angled and 268 were straight). Crows \nexhibited clear laterality, holding the tool to one side of the head >99.9% of the \ntime; crows A and B gripped the tools on their right sides, whereas crow C gripped \nthe tool on its left side (cf.9,10). Average ( ± s.e.m.) grip duration was 3.4 s  ± 0.13.\nStatistical analyses. Comparisons between Corvus species were conducted with \ngeneral linear models, testing the null hypothesis that non-tool-using species do \nnot differ from the NC crow in the chosen parameters (analyses excluded the pied \ncrow and the American crow, because no replicate measurements were available \nfor these species). Although sample sizes for general linear models were modest \n(cf. Table 1), diagnostic scatter plots of standardized residuals, and post-hoc tests, \nindicated good model fit (normality of errors; homogeneity of variance). For illus-\ntration purposes (see Fig. 2), we constructed 95% confidence intervals for species \nmeans, using Student’s t-distribution (rather than a normal distribution) because  \nof small sample sizes23. No formal statistical comparisons were made with passer-\nine and non-passerine species, because these are non-random samples that largely \nreflect research interests in the field of avian vision ecology over the past 30 years. \nIt should be noted that our present analyses examine differences between species \nin absolute terms, but do not control for phylogenetic non-independence or other \npotentially confounding factors (such as body size). Although our work establishes \nbeyond doubt that NC crows possess a highly unusual visual-field topography  \n(for effect sizes, see main text, Fig. 2 and Table 1), both in comparison with con-\ngeneric and more distantly related species, formal phylogenetic analyses would be \nMaxilla \nTomium mandibulare\nMandibula\nTool\nEye\nTool\nEye\n2 mm\nTomium maxillare\nSagittal plane\nTransverse plane\n�\n�\nFigure 5 | Modelling of hypothetical tool-projection angles in Corvus \nspecies.

The enlarged view of the bill tip \nshows how the tool-projection angle was estimated: assistants were asked \nto locate the point where the mandibula intersects the tomium maxillare, \nbefore rotating two radii around in each direction until the ends of the radii \nmet the tomium maxillare (the average angle of these two radii was taken \nas the sagittal tool-projection angle).
