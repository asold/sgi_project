  "abstract": "This preliminary study covers the construction and application of a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) system integrating a multimodal LLM, Large Language and Vision Assistant (LLaVA) with graph database software (Neo4j) to enhance LLM output quality through structured knowledge retrieval. This is aimed at the field of orbital debris detection, proposed to support the current intelligent methods for such detection by introducing the beneficial properties of both LLMs and a corpus of external information. By constructing a dynamic knowledge graph from relevant research papers, context-aware retrieval is enabled, improving factual accuracy and minimizing hallucinations. The system extracts, summarizes, and embeds research papers into a Neo4j graph database, with API-powered LLM-generated relationships enriching interconnections. Querying this graph allows for contextual ranking of relevant documents, which are then provided as context to the LLM through prompt engineering during the inference process. A case study applying the technology to a synthetic image of orbital debris is discussed. Qualitative results indicate that the inclusion of GraphRAG and external information result in successful retrieval of information and reduced hallucinations. Further work to refine the system is necessary, as well as establishing benchmark tests to assess performance quantitatively. This approach offers a scalable and interpretable method for enhanced domain-specific knowledge retrieval, improving the qualitative quality of the LLM’s output when tasked with description-based activities.",
