As players discuss and\nshare ideas during the game to deﬁne their\nstrategy, being talkative or not is one of\nthe characteristics that deﬁne them. This\npaper presents a data analysis over logs\nfrom the shared task of The 1st Interna-\ntional Workshop of AI Werewolf and Dia-\nlogue System to discuss if being talkative\nor not can be related to winning or losing\nwhen AI agents play the Werewolf game.\nOverall results show that the difference in\nthe average of utterances sent by winning\nand losing players is not signiﬁcant. How-\never, they also suggest further analysis and\ndiscussion.\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, there have been approaches to im-\nplement Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) agents capable\nof playing and competing with other agents or hu-\nman players in a variety of games. Proposals for\ngames that do not require social interaction be-\ntween the players, like chess, shogi and go, are\nachieving promising results (Silver et al., 2016,\n2018). However, developing AI agents for com-\nmunication games like the Werewolf game, where\nusually two teams (villagers and werewolves) dis-\ncuss and compete against each other, remains a\nchallenge.\nThe Artiﬁcial Intelligence based Werewolf\nproject1 is contributing to the previous aspect by\nresearching and providing platforms to develop\nand test AI Werewolf agents. Researchers can\nimplement agents to play in the protocol division\n(agents communicate in a middle language called\n1http://aiwolf.org/en/\nthe AI Werewolf protocol) or the natural language\ndivision (agents communicate using natural lan-\nguage utterances). The 1st International Work-\nshop of AI Werewolf and Dialog System 2, taking\nplace in the context of the International Natural\nLanguage Generation 2019 conference, proposed\na shared task where participants implemented AI\nagents capable of playing the Werewolf game\nusing natural language utterances (Kano et al.,\n2019).\nIn the frame of the shared task and based on\nthe idea that being talkative or not may character-\nize the strategy that some players of the Werewolf\ngame follow, this paper focuses on analyzing if\nthe talkativeness level of the participant AI agents\nmay be related to winning or losing the Werewolf\ngame. To do so, and having as reference a talkative\nagent implemented to participate in the previously\ncited shared task, this work analyzes, in Section 4,\nthe logs from the played games in which the agent\nparticipated and discusses the results in Section 5.\n2 Related Work\nIn the last few years, research based on the Were-\nwolf game is increasing.\nOn the one hand, a lot of researchers use the\ngame to analyze human players’ behaviors. For\nexample, some created the Idiap Wolf Database\nand used it to show how it is possible to automati-\ncally detect suspicious actions and how the degree\nof speaker behavior inﬂuences on the outcomes\nof the game (Hung and Chittaranjan, 2010; Chit-\ntaranjan and Hung, 2010). Other researchers used\nmachine learning to analyze video data of peo-\nple playing the game and checked the importance\nthat nonverbal information has to achieve victory\n(Katagami et al., 2014).\nOn the other hand, because of proposals like\n2https://aiwolfdial.kanolab.net/home\nthe already cited AI based Werewolf project, the\nnumber of works deﬁning implementation strate-\ngies for AI Werewolf agents is increasing. As an\nexample, some researchers proposed psychologi-\ncal models to be used to implement AI Werewolf\nagents so that they achieve higher winning rates\n(Nakamura et al., 2016). And others developed a\nbehavioral model for the implementation of agents\nbased on logs from human players (Hirata et al.,\n2016).\nThis work contributes by providing a data anal-\nysis study that opens a discussion over how the\ntalkativeness of an AI agent may be related or not\nto its winning rate. Results may serve as a refer-\nence for the future development of AI agents that\ncan play the Werewolf game and communicate us-\ning natural language.\n3 Dataset\nAs data, this paper uses a set of 60 game logs from\nthe shared task of The 1st International Work-\nshop of AI Werewolf and Dialogue System (AI-\nWolfDial2019) from the 2019 International Natu-\nral Language Generation (INLG2019) conference\n(Kano et al., 2019).\nIn all games, the same ﬁve agents (A1, A2, A3,\nA4, and A5), play the werewolf game using natu-\nral language utterances written in Japanese. The\ntalkative agent implemented for the shared task\n(A4) sends utterances as long as they do not be-\ncome excessively repetitive (slight repetition may\nresult in emphasis). All ﬁve agents participate in\nall games and, each time, they have randomly as-\nsigned one of the following roles: villager (has\nno special skill and there are two in each game),\nseer (can see if a player is human or werewolf at\nthe end of each day), possessed (human from the\nwerewolves side) or werewolf (can eliminate one\nplayer at the end of each day from day 1). Agents\nplay each role 12 times (seer, possessed and were-\nwolf cases) or 24 (villager case).\nThe shared task allows agents to communicate\nfreely using natural language during certain pe-\nriods (“days”), without specifying a maximum\nnumber of utterances per day. Since day 0 only\nconsists of greetings, Section 4 analyzes utter-\nances performed from day 1. Because of the small\nnumber of players, each game only lasts for one\nday (20 games) or two (40 games). This is be-\ncause, each day from day 1, all alive players vote\nto eliminate a player (villagers try to use this vot-\ning to eliminate the werewolf) before the werewolf\neliminates another one.\nLogs contain the following information: (i) sta-\ntus (keeps playing or not) and role of each player\nat the beginning of each day and the end of the\ngame; (ii) utterances each player performs during\nthe day; (iii) information of the seer divination at\nthe end of each day; (iv) voting each player per-\nforms at the end of each day (excluding day 0)\nand the corresponding result (which agent stops\nplaying); (v) information of the werewolf attack\nat the end of each day (excluding day 0); and (vi)\nresult of the game indicating the status and role\nof each player and the winning side (villagers or\nwerewolves).\n4 Data Analysis\nTo discuss in Section 5 if the talkativeness of AI\nagents affects their odds of winning the Werewolf\ngame, this work analyzed the data presented in\nSection 3 from different points of view: (i) game\nresult; (ii) side; (iii) role; and (iv) agent. For each\ncase, this paper presents the average (Avg.) and\nstandard deviation (Std. Dev.) of the number of\nutterances sent during one day by a player belong-\ning to one of the categories each point of view may\nconsider. When appropriate, it also presents data\ndepending on the game result (win or lose) and\nshows the winning rate.\nAgent Utterances\nGame Result Avg. Std. Dev.\nWin 8.9 1.05\nLose 9.08 0.88\nAll 8.99 0.97\nTable 1: Analysis results of the utterances sent per\nagent and day according to the game result.\nTable 1 shows an overview result by comparing\nthe average of utterances sent each day by win-\nning players and by losing players. Since the aver-\nage number of utterances sent by winning players\n(8.9) is similar to the one of losing players (9.08),\nit seems that talkativeness may not be a determin-\ning factor that leads to deciding the game result.\nBecause the difference between the winning and\nlosing agents’ data samples follows a normal dis-\ntribution, this study also performed a t-test, which\nconﬁrms that the difference in the presented aver-\nages is not signiﬁcant (p-value = 0.3214 > 0.05).\nAgent Utterances\nSide Result Avg. Std. Dev. Win. Rate\nVillagers Win 9.22 0.68 0.62\nLose 8.91 0.6\nAll 9.1 0.67\nWerewolves Win 8.38 1.3 0.38\nLose 9.18 1.01\nAll 8.88 1.19\nTable 2: Analysis results of the utterances sent per\nagent and day according to the side of the agent.\nTable 2 shows the result of the analysis per-\nformed according to the side (villagers or were-\nwolves) each agent belongs to in a game. On the\none hand, winning players from the villagers’ side\nperform more utterances (9.22) than losing players\n(8.91) and their winning rate is 0.62. On the other\nhand, losing players from the werewolves’ side\nperform more utterances (9.18) than winning play-\ners (8.38) and their winning rate is 0.38. There is\nalmost no difference between the average number\nof utterances performed by villagers’ side players\n(9.1) and the average number of utterances per-\nformed by the werewolves’ side players (8.88).\nAgent Utterances\nRole Result Avg. Std. Dev. Win. Rate\nVillager Win 9.26 0.79 0.62\nLose 8.96 0.93\nAll 9.14 0.86\nSeer Win 9.15 1.17 0.62\nLose 8.8 1.15\nAll 9.02 1.18\nPossessed Win 8.15 1.71 0.38\nLose 9.32 1.19\nAll 8.88 1.52\nWerewolf Win 8.61 1.45 0.38\nLose 9.04 1.37\nAll 8.88 1.42\nTable 3: Analysis results of the utterances sent per\nagent and day according to the role of the agent.\nTable 3 illustrates the analysis result of the ut-\nterances sent by an agent according to its role.\nResults are coherent with the ones from Table\n2, as possessed and werewolf role players (were-\nwolves’ side) tend to send more utterances when\nthey lose while villager and seer role players (vil-\nlagers’ side) send more utterances when they win.\nIn this table, we can also see how possessed and\nwerewolf players, which have a lower winning\nrate, send fewer utterances on average than vil-\nlager and seer players. Note that in the case of pos-\nsessed players, there is an increase of 1.17 points\non the average of utterances sent when they lose\nthe game compared to the times when they win.\nUtterances\nAgent Result Avg. Std. Dev. Win. Rate\nA1 Win 7.63 1.08 0.52\nLose 7.59 1.51\nAll 7.61 1.31\nA2 Win 9.63 0.77 0.52\nLose 9.5 1.1\nAll 9.57 0.95\nA3 Win 9.54 0.46 0.38\nLose 9.46 0.72\nAll 9.49 0.64\nA4 Win 9.57 0.63 0.58\nLose 9.64 0.59\nAll 9.6 0.62\nA5 Win 8.64 1.65 0.62\nLose 9.02 1.23\nAll 8.78 1.51\nTable 4: Analysis results of the utterances sent per\nagent in a day.\nFinally, Table 4 presents the analysis results of\nthe number of utterances sent per player in a day.\nAs expected because of the talkativeness of A4,\nit presents the highest average of utterances sent\nfrom among all agents (9.6), which is 0.61 points\nabove the average. Additionally, A4 also has the\nsecond-highest winning rate. It is interesting to\nobserve though, how A5 has the highest winning\nrate but has the second-lowest average of sent ut-\nterances. Additionally, A4 and A5, the players\nwith the highest winning rate, are the only ones\nwith a higher average of utterances sent in losing\ngames than in winning games.\n5 Discussion\nFrom the results obtained in Section 4, it seems\nthat the number of utterances sent by the AI agents\nparticipating in the shared task was quite similar\n(around 9 utterances per player and day). The dif-\nference in the average of utterances sent by win-\nning and losing players is also not signiﬁcant.\nConsequently, we may be able to conclude that\nthe number of utterances sent by the participant AI\nagents of the shared task may not be a signiﬁcant\nfactor that determines the game result. However,\nsince the winning rate of villagers’ side players\n(0.62) is higher than the one of the werewolves’\nside players (0.38), it seems that other factors are\nleading certain players to victory.\nOne of the elements that may affect is the strat-\negy implemented for each of the agents. As an\nexample, the talkative agent implemented (A4)\nachieves a 0.46 winning rate when playing on the\nwerewolves’ side by following a strategy of faking\nthe seer under certain circumstances.\nTwo other elements that may also affect are the\ncontent provided in an agent’s utterances and the\nway it processes utterances performed by other\nagents. Note that, in the natural language division\nof the Werewolf game, performing appropriate ut-\nterances may be as important as listening and un-\nderstanding the other agent utterances.\n6 Conclusions and Future Work\nThis paper presented a data analysis on some logs\nfrom the shared task of AIWolfDial2019 work-\nshop from INLG2019. The goal was to verify if\nthe talkativeness of an AI agent could have an im-\npact on the Werewolf game result.\nOverall results showed that the number of utter-\nances may not be a determinant factor inﬂuencing\nthe result of the games played by the AI agents\nparticipating in the shared task.\nSome questions that future work in this line may\naddress could be: (i) are there some kinds of utter-\nances that lead to winning or losing the game?; (ii)\nto what extent is the utterances’ content important\nas far as a good game strategy is followed?; and\n(iii) how much do the other agents’ strategy and\nconversational capabilities inﬂuence an agent’s re-\nsult?\nThis paper analyzed logs generated by only ﬁve\nAI werewolf agents, each with their own unique\nand independent strategies and conversational ca-\npabilities. Because the results of the analysis may\ndepend on the implementation of the agents, it\nwould also be interesting to analyze more data\ngenerated by a larger variety of agents.\nReferences\nGokul Chittaranjan and Hayley Hung. 2010.
