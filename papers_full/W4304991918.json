  "abstract": "Introduction:The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the standard of care for treatment and prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT), also used for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.Ischemic strokes and cerebrovascular diseases often lead to symptomatic epilepsy among elderly patients, requiring addition of chronic antiepileptic drugs.The cytochrome P-450 (CYP 450) system is responsible for DOAC metabolism, while phenytoin is a well-documented CYP-450 inducer.We present a case with documented interaction between Apixaban and phenytoin, resulting in recurrent DVT.Methods: A 60-year-old male with medical history of DVT and PE status post Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter on warfarin anticoagulation and history of seizures on phenytoin, presented to the emergency room with lower extremity swelling and shortness of breath.On admission, he was found to have acute right profunda femoral DVT.He reported provoked left lower extremity DVT with bilateral sub massive PE after hemilaminectomy eight years prior, requiring initiation of warfarin anticoagulation.Six months ago, he was transitioned to Eliquis 5 mg twice daily.He reported compliance without missed doses.He was known to be on phenytoin for many years due to a history of seizures.The hematology service was consulted due to concern for DOAC failure.It was recognized that apixaban failure was due to phenytoin use.He was bridged via lowmolecular weight heparin to warfarin and discharged 2 days later.Results: Apixaban is metabolized by the CYP 450 system, primarily CYP3A4.It is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (Pgp) which regulates the elimination of DOACs from the gastrointestinal lumen.Potent CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers like phenytoin may reduce the plasma concentration of apixaban and cause thrombosis, while potent inhibitors may increase the plasma concentration of apixaban and cause bleeding.In 2017, Hager et al. reported occurrence of left atrial thrombus due to concomitant use of phenytoin 300 mg daily and dabigatran 150 mg twice daily in a 70-year-old patient with history of recurrent DVT and PE.Similarly, Becerra et al. describe subtherapeutic DOAC (or factor Xa) levels in a 48-year-old woman with cerebral vein thrombosis also taking phenytoin.Discussion: Drug-drug interactions between AEDs and DOACs are dangerous and physicians should be aware of metabolism and safety profiles when prescribing DOAC's.Given the clear understanding of the effect of phenytoin on apixaban metabolism, it is evident that concomitant administration is contraindicated.",
