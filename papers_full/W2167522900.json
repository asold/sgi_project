It is an infection of the\nsubcutaneous tissues that is caused by actinomycetes (actinomy-\ncetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma) and is characterized by the\ndevelopment of large subcutaneous masses and discharging sinuses\n[1]. Within the discharged material, the causative agents are\nlocated both in and outside of grains. The colours of the grains can\noften be indicative of the aetiological agent: fungal grains are\nusually black or pale, while those of actinomycetes are white,\nyellow, or red (Figure 1) [1].\nSince both actinomycetes and fungi are implicated as causative\nagents, it is important to distinguish them in order to ensure that\ncorrect treatments are given. Actinomycetoma is treated with\nantibiotics and eumycetoma with a combination of antifungal\ntherapy and surgery [2]. The relevance of correct species\nidentification was emphasised in a recent published case report\nin which a patient presented with yellow-grain eumycetoma\ncaused by the fungus Pleurostomophora ochracea [3]. In the past,\nyellow grains were always considered to be of bacterial origin, and\nantibacterial, as opposed to antifungal, treatment was started and\nfound to be ineffective.\nIn addition to differentiating actinomycetoma and eumycetoma,\nit is important to identify causal agents to the species level to\nensure correct antimicrobial therapy. Several actinomycetes and\nfungi have been implicated as causative agents of mycetoma [4].\nIn vitro, not all fungi are equally susceptible to antifungal agents;\nfor instance, Madurella fahalii is not inhibited by high concentra-\ntions of ketoconazole and itraconazole, which are drugs that are\nused in the treatment of eumycetoma [5]. Regarding actinomy-\ncetoma, therapeutic outcome is based on a prompt and adequate\nresponse to the administered antimicrobials. Actinomycetes\nusually respond well to cotrimoxazole, but a combination of this\nantibiotic with aminoglycosides is used in advanced cases or in\ncases not responding to treatment. Other antibiotics can also be\nused. Ideally, sensitivity tests should be done before starting\ntreatment, namely, shortly after the etiologic agent is isolated.\nIn this review we summarize the currently used diagnostic tools\nand discuss their merits and pitfalls in the diagnosis of mycetoma.\nImaging Technology\nAn initial diagnosis is made after clinical assessment. Clinical\nexamination alone does not identify the causative organism nor\ndoes it detect the spread of disease along the different tissue planes\nand bone. Imaging techniques, such as radiology, ultrasonogra-\nphy, CT scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be\nused to determine the extent of lesions.\nConventional radiographs are used to identify the limits of\nlesions and to determine if bone is affected (Figure 2A). It is\nimportant to detect if bone is infected as nonsurgical cure is\nuncertain in such cases [6]. Several different radiological signs\nshould be sought. Abd El Bagi suggested a radiographic\nclassification of mycetoma to determine the extent of lesions\n(Table 1) based on radiographic records of 516 patients seen in the\nMycetoma Research Centre, Khartoum, Sudan [7]. It is evident\nfrom this table that with classic radiology, multiple radiological\nchanges can be detected. This method can be used to show the\npresence and extent of soft tissue granulomas [6] and to\ndemonstrate bone invasion by the causative agent or the\noccurrence of pathological fractures [8]. Fractures, however, are\nuncommon; of the 517 patients seen in a diagnostic centre in\nCitation: van de Sande WWJ, Fahal AH, Goodfellow M, Mahgoub ES, Welsh O, et\nal.

This technique is routinely\nused in the diagnosis of mycetoma. Mycetoma grains, capsules,\nand the accompanying inflammatory granulomata have a\ncharacteristic ultrasonic appearance [10]. Hyper-reflective echoes\nwere noted only in mycetoma lesions and were recorded as fine\n(22%) or sharp (35%), numerous (50%) or few (17%), isolated\n(30%) or aggregated (17%), and diffuse (10%) or settled at the\nbottom of cavities (22%) [10]. However, when active sinuses are\npresent in lesions, the identification of these hyper-reflective\nechoes are less clear [10]. Due to the presence of these hyper-\nreflective echoes, ultrasound imaging can be used to differentiate\nbetween mycetoma and non-mycetoma lesions and between\nactinomycetoma and eumycetoma [8,10]. In eumycetoma lesions,\nthe grains produce numerous sharp bright hyper-reflective echoes,\nwhich correspond to the black grains [8]. It is thought that the\ngrain cement material is the origin of these sharp echoes. In\nactinomycetoma, the echoes obtained from grains are less distinct,\nprobably due to their smaller size and consistency [8]. Although it\nis possible to distinguish between actinomycetoma and eumyce-\ntoma, it is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between\ndifferent causative agents [8].\nMRI is useful for visualizing soft tissue involvement and bone\ndestruction (Figure 2C) [8,11,12]. With this technique, grains\nappear as conglomerates of small (2–5 mm) round hyperintense\nlesions, representing granulation tissue, surrounded by a low-\nsignal-intensity rim [12]. By correlating MRI data with histological\nfindings, Sarris et al. showed that the high-signal-intensity foci seen\nwith MRI represented inflammatory granulomata, while the\ncentral low-signal-intensity dots were caused by grains [13]. The\nlow-signal-intensity signs were named ‘‘dot-in-circle’’ and were\nseen in 80% of patients, which made this appearance highly\nindicative of mycetoma [12,14]. In 2012, El Shamy and colleagues\nreported a new grading system for MRI diagnosis of mycetoma\n[15] in which a score was given for skin, subcutaneous tissue,\nmuscle, and bone involvement (Table 2) [15]. Mycetoma lesions\ncan be classified as mild (score 1–3), moderate (score 4–7), or\nsevere (score 8–10) based on these scores. MRI was not suitable to\ndiscriminate actinomycetoma from eumycetoma, although acti-\nnomycetoma more often showed soft tissue microabscesses, bony\nperiosteal reaction and reactive sclerosis, while eumycetoma\nfrequently exhibited soft tissue macroabscesses with bone cavita-\ntion, such differences were not statistically significant [15].\nThe merits of these imaging techniques are that they are fast, non-\ninvasive, and can easily be used to detect the extent of lesions and\nhelp in planning appropriate treatment strategies. Of the various\ntechniques discussed above, radiography and ultrasound imaging\nare the most applicable in low-income countries and can be used in\nlocal settings, provided that proper training is given. Radiography\nshould normally be available in most peripheral hospitals, but not\nMRI, a situation that hinders the implementation of this latter\nFigure 1.

When the technique is\navailable, expertise is needed to differentiate between mycetoma\nand bone tuberculosis, granulomas and chronic bacterial osteomy-\nelitis and soft tissue tumours [8].\nCytology and Histology\nGrains need to be isolated from lesions in order to identify\ncausative agents of mycetoma to the species level. This is usually\nperformed by a deep-seated biopsy or with fine needle aspiration\ncytology (FNAC) (Figure 3). The latter was described in 1991 and\nfully evaluated by Yousif and colleagues in 2010 [16]. In this\ntechnique, a fine needle attached to a syringe is inserted into the\nlesion by applying negative pressure and moving the needle up\nand down in at least three different directions so that sufficient\naspirated material can be obtained. This material is usually bloody\nand is therefore left to clot, then examined either by eye or\nmicroscopically after fixation in 10% formalin-saline and staining\nFigure 2. Imaging techniques used in mycetoma.A: A radiograph of the foot, showing soft tissue shadow (arrow), and multiple large cavities (c)\nin line with eumycetoma. B: A typical sonogram of scrotal eumycetoma. In this sonogram multiple cavities with thick walls and multiple hyper-\nreflective echoes (arrow) are seen, which are in line with grains. C: An MRI of the foot, showing massive soft tissue and bone destruction. In this MRI,\ngrains appear as conglomerates of small (2–5 mm) round hyperintense lesions (arrow).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002918.g002\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 3 July 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e2918\nwith haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) [16]. Yousif examined 230\nmycetoma patients using FNAC and the cell block technique to\nexamine the grains ofActinomadura madurae, Actinomadura pelletierii,\nStreptomyces somaliensis , and Madurella mycetomatis and the tissue\nresponse to mycetoma. The technique had sensitivities of 87.5%\nand 85.7% for eumycetoma and actinomycetoma, respectively\n[16].\nThe identification of causative agents of mycetoma based on\nhistology has been performed since the 1950s [17]. Grains can be\nidentified in H&E stained sections (Figure 1), but special stains\nare essential for in-depth identification of the causative organisms\n[17,18]. Gram stains, such as Gram Weigert, can be used to\nexamine actinomycetoma tissue [18]. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS),\nGomori methenamine silver, and Gridley are the most useful\nstains for detecting hyphae and chlamydospores in eumycetoma\ngrains [18]. Chufal and colleagues published a strategy in 2012 to\nidentify causative agents based on histology (Figure 4) [19]. It can\nbe seen from this figure that it is not possible to differentiate\nbetween Nocardia strains at the species level based on histology\n[20,21]. Round, oval, or vermiform structures, which stain\neosinophilic with haematoxylin, are found [17]. The delicate\nactinomycete filaments that may fragment into coccoid forms can\nbe shown by Gram stain [17].A. pelletieri grains, which stain red\nor dark blue with hematoxylin, consist of several lobules of\ngeometric appearance with denticulate edges that resemble a\nbroken dish [17]. In contrast, A. madurae grains have a central\neosinophilic area surrounded by a densely packed zone of dark\nhematoxylin-stained filaments [17]. Peripherally, an eosin\nstained fringe with pseudoclub shaped structures can be observed\n[17].\nEumycetoma grains can be divided into black and pale grains.\nThe most common causative agent is M. mycetomatis [4]. In\nhistology sections, two types of grains of this agent are seen:\nfilamentous and vesicular [22]. The filamentous type is the most\ncommon and consists of brown septate and branched hyphae\nthat may be slightly more swollen towards the periphery [22].\nThe vesicular type is composed of unusually large cells which\nlook like vesicles. Both types of grain can be found in the same\nlesion [22]. A brown granular cement material is present inside\nmost of the grains [17]. In the black grains of Falciformispora\nsenegalensis (synonym: Leptoshaeria senegalensis )a n dTrematosphaeria\ngrisea (synonym: Madurella grisea) the centre is non-pigmented and\ncement is absent, whereas at the peripheries the grains are dark\ncoloured and brown cement is present [17]. It is difficult to\ndistinguish between F. senegalensis and T. grisea based on histology\nalone, but according to Mariat and Verghese, the borders ofF.\nsenegalensis grains are less even and more crenelated, the\nperipheral zones show larger vesicles while the hyphae at the\nperiphery show a more irregular arrangement [17]. Pale grain\neumycetoma caused by Scedosporium boydii (synonym: Pseudal-\nlescheria boydii ), Acremonium spp. and Fusarium spp. are similar\nhistopathologically and almost impossible to distinguish from\neach other [21]. There are some features that might be helpful in\nrecognizing individual organisms [23]; for instance, inSc. boydii\nvesicles are usually noted, though this feature cannot be used\ndiagnostically [21,23] as someAcremonium kiliense grains also have\nvesicles. In order to identify Sc. boydii more reliably on\nhistological slides, Hagari and associates performed a nested\nPCR with Sc. boydii specific primers on paraffin-embedded\nhistology slides (Table 3) [24].\nIn summary, histology can be used to differentiate actinomy-\ncetoma and eumycetoma, while FNAC is a fast technique that\nmay aid in choosing proper treatment. Histology cannot be relied\nupon for definitive species identification; hence, confirmation\nbased on other techniques is needed.\nTable 1.Radiographic classification of bone involvement in mycetoma as described by Abd El Bagi [7].\nStage Pattern of Spread Effect Findings\n0 Limited to entry side Soft-tissue swelling No bone involvement\nI Expanding granuloma Extrinsic pressure Displacement or scalloping\nII Impending bone invasion Bone irritation Periosteal reaction or reactive sclerosis\nIII Localized bone invasion Erosion or cavitation Solitary bone involvement\nIV Longitudinal spread Joint involvement Localized along single ray\nV Horizontal spread Invasion of adjacent structures Localized to forefoot, midfoot, or hindfoot\nVI Multidirectional spread Total disruption Multiple rays and multiple rows involved\nTable adapted from Abd El Bagi et al.

Since grains should be free of\ncontaminants, a deep-seated surgical biopsy is needed [8,25].\nGrains collected from discharges of open sinuses are often non-\nviable and contaminated [8]. Some of the collected grains should\nbe directly crushed in 10% KOH and used for microscopy; the\nremainder are used for culture [26].\nActinomycetoma grains can be identified using Gram and\nZiehl-Neelsen (ZN) stains [8]. Gram staining can demonstrate the\ngram-positive hyphae of filamentous actinomycetes; the ZN stain\nis usually used for the identification of Nocardia spp. Fungal\nfilaments can be stained with calcofluor white or cotton blue [27].\nIn order to culture the causative agents, grains are usually\nwashed several times in sterile saline, crushed with a sterile glass\nrod, and plated onto appropriate media [8,25]. If direct\nexamination of the grain reveals evidence of actinomycetes,\nisolation media should not contain antibiotics [18]. Blood, brain-\nheart infusion, Lo ¨wenstein, and modified Sabouraud agar\nsupplemented with 0.5% yeast extract are commonly recom-\nmended for the isolation of actinomycetes [8,18]. If direct\nexamination of grains is indicative of eumycetoma, grains can be\nadditionally washed with antibiotics and spread over Sabouraud\nagar plates supplemented with antibiotics. Commonly used\nantibiotics are gentamicin sulphate (400\nmg/ml), penicillin G\n(20 U/ml), streptomycin (40mg/ml), or chloramphenicol (50mg/\nml) [18]. It is also advisable to include a plate without antibiotics,\nsince the growth of some Madurella and actinomycete strains\nappear to be inhibited by these antibiotics. Plates should be\nincubated at 25uC and 37uC irrespective of whether the causative\nagent is bacterial or fungal in origin (Figure 5).\nAfter culture, presumptive species identification can be based on\nmicromorphological and cultural properties [25]. Nocardiae are\npartially acid-alcohol fast positive and typically produce substrate\nand aerial hyphae that fragment into rod- and coccoid-like\nelements streptomycetes form a yellowish substrate mycelium and\nlack aerial hyphae, andA. madurae and A. pelletieri strains produce\ncream- and red-pigmented substrate mycelial respectively and on\ninitial isolation tend to lack aerial hyphae [28,29]. For eumyce-\ntoma, identification is mainly based on the morphology of the\nfruiting bodies (if present) [18]. For species such asMadurella,i n\nwhich sporulation is usually not observed, the chance for\nmisidentification is common. Furthermore, for M. mycetomatis ,\nvarious colony morphologies have been observed, which makes\nidentification even more troublesome [18]. Differentiation be-\ntween T. grisea and Medicopsis romeroi (synonym: Pyrenochaeta romeroi)is\nalso difficult. AlthoughT. grisea is usually sterile, some isolates are\nknown to produce abortive pycnidia like those formed byMed.\nromeroi [18]. Also differentiation of the various dematiaceous fungi,\nsuch as Exopiala spp., based solely on morphology is sometimes\ndifficult, especially since some of these fungi only express yeast\nmorphology on isolation, and initial subculture and conidiogenesis\ncan only be induced after considerable manipulation [30].\nFor species identification of actinomycetes, phenotypic proper-\nties and assimilation tests can be performed, as exemplified by the\nuse of API 20C, API ZYM and API Coryne kits for the\nidentification of Nocardia species [31–33]. However, API 20C\nassimilation results have been found to be variable withinNocardia\nspecies, which makes definitive identification difficult [32]. When\nthe assimilation of adonitol, galactose, glucose, glycerol, inositol,\nN-acetyl-D-glucosamine, and trehalose were considered reasonable,\ndiscrimination between Nocardia species was obtained, though\nresults were not 100% specific [32]. In contrast, with the API\nZYM system distinct enzymatic profiles were obtained forNocardia\nasteroides, Nocardia brasiliensis and Nocardia otitidiscaviarum , though\nother pathogenic species ofNocardia could not be separated by this\nassay [33]. Further,N. brasiliensis was differentiated fromNocardia\nfarcinica using API Coryne kits [31]. Antibiotic susceptibility\npatterns have also been used to identify various Nocardia spp.,\nnotably those based on amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin\n[32]. Since neither assimilation patterns nor susceptibility profiles\nalone were able to identifyNocardia species, Kiska and colleagues\nproposed a stepwise approach for species identification starting\nwith susceptibility profiles and adding assimilation patterns and\npigment production to the identification algorithm [32]. In this\nway, eight clinically relevantNocardia species were identified [32].\nHowever, the addition of several pathogenic species to the genus\nNocardia makes it difficult to know whether such phenotypic tests\ncan be weighted for identification in the future.\nFor the delineation of pathogenicStreptomyces spp. the following\nphenotypic properties are of value: production ofb-glucuronidase;\naesculin hydrolysis; degradation of adenine, casein and hypoxan-\nthine; growth on adonitol, glycerol, glycogen, meso-inositol, D-\nraffinose, L-rhamnose, D-turanose, D-xylose and L-aspartic acid\nas sole carbon sources [28]. Furthermore, growth at 50uC and\npH 11.0 provide additional data of diagnostic value [28]. A.\nmadurae and A. pelletieri can be separated from most other\nactinomycetes by the detection of chymotrypsin using the API\nZYM system. In addition,A. madurae was found to be positive for\na-glucosidase and negative forN-acetyl-b-glucosaminidase, while\nfor A. pelletieri the opposite was found [33].\nLimited information is available on phenotypic properties and\nassimilation patterns for eumycetoma agents; therefore, these\npathogens are still mainly identified solely by morphology.T. grisea\ncan be distinguished fromM. mycetomatisbased on the presence of a\nsecreted pigment and the assimilation of lactose, but not sucrose by\nM. mycetomatis[27]. It remains to be seen whether this simple system\ncan be used to identify recently classifiedMadurella species, namely\nM. fahalii, M. pseudomycetomatisand M. tropicanausing API 20C AUX\nkits [34]. M. pseudomycetomatis was found to assimilate arabinose,\ncellulose, glucose, maltose, trehalose, and xylose, though such tests\nhave yet to be applied to the two otherMadurella species [34].\nSimilarly, for Sc. boydii, an array of physiology and assimilation\npatterns have been determined [35] but have not been routinely\nused to distinguish other species. Carbohydrate and nitrate\nassimilation have been determined forExophiala spp., though it is\nvery difficult to differentiate between these species solely on this\nFigure 3.

E. dermatitidis and E. jeanselmei have very similar\nassimilation patterns and can only be differentiated from one\nanother based on NaNO\n3 assimilation [30].\nIn summary, culture methods are still considered to be the gold\nstandard in species identification of the causal agents of mycetoma;\nhowever, some agents are difficult to identify by morphology alone.\nF u r t h e r m o r e ,m o s tc u l t u r em e t h o d sa r et i m ec o n s u m i n g ,c o n t a m i n a -\ntion is common, and experience is needed to read results accurately.\nSkin Tests\nIn order to develop a fast diagnostic tool, skin tests were\ndeveloped in the past and applied with some success. When\nprotein derivatives of N. brasiliensis were intradermally adminis-\ntered in a dose of 0.2mg in 0.1 ml, all of the patients infected with\nthis organism reacted positively to this antigen with indurations of\n.6 mm in diameter, while none of the tuberculosis patients or\nhealthy adults showed a positive reaction [36]. However, a single\nmycetoma patient infected withA. madurae did not give a positive\nreaction in the skin test. When culture filtrate antigens were\nprepared in 0.1 ml quantities fromA. pelletieri, S. somaliensis and M.\nmycetomatis, positive skin reactions were found in patients infected\nwith either A. madurae or S. somaliensis using the A. pelletieri and S.\nsomaliensis antigens after 5 hours and after 24 hours, but not\nagainst M. mycetomatis [37]. Four out of the 13 M. mycetomatis\neumycetoma patients gave a positive skin reaction against theM.\nmycetomatis antigen within 5 hours, though only one gave a positive\nreaction after 24 hours [37]. Furthermore, five patients reacted\nwith theA. pelletieri and S. somaliensisantigens after 5 hours but not\nafter 24 hours, demonstrating that this skin test was not useful in\ndiagnosing eumycetoma [37].\nSerology\nDue to the invasive procedures needed to obtain grains and the\nlong incubation times needed for identification of causative agents,\nattempts have been made to develop serological assays for the\ndiagnosis of mycetoma.\nImmunodiffusion (ID), counter-immuno-electrophoresis (CIE),\nand Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays (ELISA) have been\ndeveloped to detect mycetoma caused byA. madurae, A. pelletieri,\nand S. somaliensis using crude cytoplasmic antigens of these agents\n[38–41]. CIE and immunodiffusion are two techniques that are\nbased on the formation of antibody-antigen precipitin lines in agar\ngels [38,42]. Gumaa and Mahgoub demonstrated that from 200\nsera negative by immunodiffusion, 76 sera reacted in the CIE;\nhence, they concluded that CIE was more sensitive than ID in the\ndiagnosis of mycetoma [38]. McLaren compared ELISA with CIE\nand found that while the former was more sensitive, it gave weak\npositive reactions in some of the Egyptian and Sudanese controls.\nThis background reaction was reduced when the cytoplasmatic\nantigens were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 20,000 g, indicating\nthat the pure antigens are necessary to produce a reliable\ndiagnostic serological tool [41].\nSerological tests have been developed forN. asteroides and N.\nbrasiliensis using purified antigens from culture supernatants of\nthese organisms. SDS-PAGE was used to demonstrate that a 54–\n55 kDA antigen found in culture media was present inN. asteroides,\nN. brasiliensis, andN. otitidiscaviarum[43]. From dot blot and western\nblot analysis it was demonstrated that the antigen reacted with sera\nfrom N. brasiliensis- , N. asteroides- , and R. rhodochrous -infected\npatients, but not with sera from healthy controls [43]. Surprisingly,\nin the dot blot analysis one out of twoA. madurae-positive patients\nFigure 4. Flow diagram of histological identification of causative agents of mycetoma, based on references[18,19,23].\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002918.g004\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 6 July 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e2918\nalso reacted with this antigen [43]. In the Western blot analysis,\nsera from nocardiosis patients and one out of five tuberculosis\npatients also reacted positively.\nMore discriminatory antigens were identified by Vera-Cabrera\nand Salinas-Carmona and colleagues [43,44]. They identified\nimmunodominant proteins of 24 kDa (named P24) and 61 kDa\n(named P61) by SDS-PAGE and purified them by Sephadex\npurification and dialysis, respectively. In 1993, an ELISA was\ndeveloped with the purified p24 protein and tested against\nmycetoma, leprosy, and tuberculosis patients. All 26 mycetoma\npatients gave absorbance values equal to or above 0.3, whereas the\nserum samples from 53 tuberculosis and leprosy patients or from\nhealthy controls had absorbance values below this level. Several\nsera were available for analysis of five mycetoma patients during,\nbefore, and after therapy. During active disease, absorbance values\nwere always above 0.3, but when patients were treated and\nclassified as cured, the absorbance levels dropped below this level.\nThis showed that the assay could be useful for monitoring\ntherapeutic responses [44]. Furthermore, antibody titres dropped\nin patients who were cured and increased in those who presented\nreactivation [44].\nSerological assays have been developed to detect infections\ncaused by M. mycetomatis and Sc. boydii. An indirect hemaggluti-\nnation assay (IHA) and an ID assay with crude antigens were\ndeveloped for Sc. boydii [39,45]. In the IHA, a partially purified\npolysaccharide antigen isolated from Sc. boydii was coupled to\nsheep erythrocytes, and a serial two-fold dilution of the patient\nserum was added [45]. It appeared that five patients had antibody\nlevels ranging from 1:16 to 1:512, and the healthy controls’\nantibody levels ranged from 1:4 to 1:32 in endemic areas.\nThe ID and CIE methods have been more widely used,\nespecially for M. mycetomatis [38,39]. In these assays, crude\nTable 3.Primers used for molecular diagnostics.\nSpecies Target\nForward primer\nSequence (59R39)\nReverse primer\nSequence (59R39)\nProbe\nSequence (59R39) Size (bp) Reference\nStreptomyces spp. 16S rRNA AGAGTTTGATMTGGCTCAG AAGGAGGTGWTCCARCC 1363 to 1521 [28]\nNocardia spp. 16S rRNA ACCGACCACAAGGGG GGTTGTAACCTCTTCGA 596 [54]\nNocardia spp. 16S rRNA GCTTAACACATGCAAGTCG GAATTCCAGTCTCCCCTG 606 [31]\nNocardia spp. 16S rRNA AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG 498 [59]\nNocardia spp. 16S-23S rRNA\nintergenic\nspacer\nGTGCGGCTGGATCACCTCCT GACAGCTCCCCGAGGCTTATC-\nGCA\nvarious [58]\nNocardia spp. hsp65 ACCAACGATGGTGTGTCCAT CTTGTCGAACCGCATACCCT 441 [55,59]\nNocardia spp. hsp65 GTTGTCCTGGAGAAGAAGTGG CTTGTCGAACCGCATACCCT 476 [59]\nNocardia spp. gyrB CTTCGCCAACACCATCAACAC TGATGATCGACTGGACCTCG 610 [59]\nNocardia spp. gyrB CGAGGAGGGCTTCCGCGCGG ATCGACTGGACCTCGTTGTTC 521 [59]\nNocardia spp. secA1 GCGACGCCGAGTGGATGG TTGGCCTTGATGGCGTTGTTC 483 [59]\nNocardia spp. secA1 GCGACGCCGAGTGGATGG GCGGACGATGTAGTCCTTGTC 520 [59]\nNocardia spp. rpoB CCGCTACAAGATCAACAAGA-\nAGC\nCCCGCGAGGACATCGTCG 737 [59]\nNocardia spp. rpoB CCGCTACAAGATCAACAAGA-\nAGC\nGGCGACGTACTCCATCTCCTC 780 [59]\nNocardia spp. rpoB CCCGCGAGGACATCGTCG CCCGCGAGGACATCGTCG 655 [59]\nNocardia spp. rpoB CGAGTACCTGGTGCGYCTGC TCGACCGGCGAGTTGGCCTG 599 [59]\nFungi ITS TTACGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTA GCATTCCCAAACAACTCGACTC Various [64]\nFungi ITS TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG Various [67]\nM. mycetomatis ITS AATGAGTTGGGCTTTAACGG TCCCGGTAGTGTAGTGTCCCT 420 [67]\nSc. boydii ITS GAGGCAATAACAGGTCT-\nGTGATGC\nTTACTACGCAGAAGGCAA 800 [68]\nSc. boydii ITS AATCTTTGAACGCACATTG TTACTACGCAGAAGGCAA 197 [24]\nSc.boydii ITS TGTCCGAGCGTCATTTC TTACTACGCAGAAGGCAA 149 [24]\nSc. boydii ITS ATGGGCACCGAAGAAGCA CGCGCAGACACGATA pGGGTCGCGAAGACT\nCGCCGTAgatcaTGCT\nTCTTCGGTGCCCAT\ntaccggtgcggatagctac\nCGCGCAGACACGATA\ngtcta\nTTTCAGGGCCT\nACGGA\nVarious* [70]\nSc.boydii BT2 TGGCGAGCACGGTCTTG ACATTCACGGCAGACACTGATT FAM-TAGCAACGGA-\nGTGTACGGAACCA-\nCCC-BBQ\n96** [69]\n* Rolling Circle amplification assay, probe listed is the padlock probe to be used in this assay.\n** quantitative real time PCR assay.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002918.t003\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 7 July 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e2918\ncytoplasmatic antigens extracted only with saline or precipitated\nby acetone are used [39]. Positive precipitation bands were found\nin all sera from patients with proven and presumedM. mycetomatis\nmycetoma when M. mycetomatis antigens were used and the same\nwas true for Sc. boydii [39]. Later it appeared that the\nimmunodiffusion assay could be negative in some patients with\nmycetoma, especially ones receiving treatment or with early lesions\n[38]. CIE appeared to be superior to ID in terms of sensitivity for\neumycetoma [38,39], as was the case for actinomycetoma.\nELISAs have been developed to define if there are more\nsensitive and specific tools to determine the antibody response to\nmycetoma antigens. The ELISA developed by Wethered and\ncolleagues was produced with crude extracts and could discrim-\ninate between patients and controls [46]. The ELISA produced by\nMcLaren and colleagues was less reliable: out of nine healthy\ncontrols tested, four were positive with no clinical sign of\nmycetoma [41]. Taha and colleagues demonstrated that with\ntheir ELISA, both mycetoma patients and uninfected controls\nliving in endemic areas had antibodies formed against mycetoma\nagents [40]. Consequently, in endemic areas, only CIE has been\nused for the diagnosis of mycetoma. Recently, the Mycetoma\nResearch Centre in Khartoum stopped using this assay because\nthe lack of standardization of the antigen preparation resulted in a\nvariation in the outcome of this diagnostic tool. The partially\npurified antigens for both CIE and other serological tools are\nprepared by grinding mycelia in saline, disintegrating them\nultrasonically, and collecting the cytoplasmatic proteins by\ncentrifugation [26,46,47]. Production of such antigens may result\nin variation between tests. A serological assay based on a\nrecombinant antigen is to be preferred.\nRecombinant antigens have been produced forM. mycetomatis.\nThe only serological tools which use recombinant antigens are\nthe ELISA described by van de Sande and colleagues [48] and\nthe Luminex described by de Klerk and associates [49]. The\nrecombinant translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP)\nwas included in both assays. The Luminex assay also included\nrecombinant fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) and pyruvate\nkinase (PK) antigens [48,49]. With these recombinant antigens it\nwas noted that although patients gave higher antibody levels,\nhealthy controls also produce antibodies against them, making it\nimpractical to use these recom binant antigens as diagnostic\ntools.\nIn summary, serological tools provide a cheap and relatively fast\nway to identify mycetoma causative agents, though to achieve\nreliable results it is necessary to use standardized antigen\npreparations. For N. brasiliensis a reliable serological tool has been\ndeveloped with the purified p24 protein, but for the other\ncausative agents of mycetoma reliable serological diagnostic tools\nare not yet available.\nMolecular Techniques\nDifficulties associated with the accurate identification of the\nknown causative agents of actinomycetoma using phenotypic\ncriteria promoted the development and application of molecular\ndiagnostic procedures. Reliable identification of causal agents to\nthe genera Actinomadura, Nocardia, and Streptomyces can be achieved\nby PCR and sequencing of conserved genes, notably, by\ncomparison of almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences of\nisolates against corresponding sequences of their phylogenetic\nneighbours drawn from databases using software such as\nEzTaxon-e [50] and appropriate clustering algorithms. In\ncontrast, identification of pathogenic actinomadurae, nocardiae,\nand streptomycetes to the rank of species remains problematic.\nSeveral molecular methods have been developed for the\nidentification of aerobic, filamentous, clinically significant actino-\nmycetes, notably nocardiae. These include the use of PCR coupled\nwith restriction endonuclease analysis of the resultant products\n[51–55] and PCR of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA\nfingerprints [56]. Similar approaches based on 16S rRNA gene\npolymorphisms have also been employed [57].\nWehrhahn and colleagues developed a PCR procedure for\nidentification and subtyping ofNocardia species based on the 16S–\n23S intergenic spacer region that resulted in the generation of\namplicons of different sizes; these were analysed using a cost-\neffective sequencer-based capillary gel electrophoretic system [58].\nThis method was used to correctly identify 142 out of the 145\ntested isolates to the correct species [58]. McTaggart developed a\nmultilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on sequencing of 16S\nrRNA genes, theb subunit of type II DNA topoisomerase (gyrB)\ngenes, the subunit A of SecA preprotein translocase (secA1) genes,\nhsp65 genes, and RNA polymerase (rpoB) genes [59]. This method\nwas used to reliably identify Nocardia species, but the three-loci\n(gyrB-16S-secA1) or four-loci ( gyrB-16S-sefcA1-hsp65) MLSA was\nnearly as reliable and is more amenable for use in the diagnostic\nclinical microbiology laboratories [59].\nMolecular diagnostic procedures have led to significant\nimprovements in the identification of aerobic, pathogenic actino-\nmycetes, though there is evidence that the results of such studies\nneed to be interpreted with care if the misidentification of unusual\nisolates is to be avoided [60–62]. Again, the long-term diagnostic\nvalue of current molecular-based procedures is difficult to foresee,\ngiven the need to apply them to an ever-expanding number of\nActinomadura, Nocardia, and Streptomyces species. This problem is\ncompounded by evidence that key pathogenic species, such asA.\nmadurae and N. asteroides, are heterogeneous [29,63]. Consequently,\nunusual or potentially novel causal agents of actinomycetoma need\nto be compared with their immediate neighbour(s) in 16S rRNA\ngene trees prior to the application of additional diagnostic\nprocedures known to have traction at the rank of species.\nThe molecular identification of the causal agents of\neumycetoma is mainly based on the internal transcribed spacer\n(ITS) that is located between the 18S and 28S genes. By using\nthe pan-fungal ITS primers and by either sequencing or\ndigesting the resulting PCR product with restriction-endonu-\ncleases, causative agents can be identified to the species level\n[64–67]. A PCR developed for M. mycetomatis using primers\nlocated within the ITS regio n appears to be specific, as\namplification was not detected when DNA from T. grisea ,\nBiatriospora mackinnonii (synonym: Pyrenochaeta mackinnonii ), and\nMed. romeroi were used [67]. Molecular diagnostic tools have\nbeen developed for Sc. boydii, but most of these assays are based\non the b-tubulin gene (BT2) and not on the ITS gene, as the\nBT2 gene is more discriminatory. The PCR developed for the\nITS region by Wedde and associates, for instance, not only\namplified Sc. boydii but also Pseudallescheria augusta and Pseudal-\nlescheria ellipsoidea [68]. A quantitative real time PCR (qPCR)\nprocedure with a probe specific for Sc. boydii and Scedosporium\napiospermum (Table 3) has been developed, though some cross-\nreactivity was observed with Scedosporium minutispora [69].\nFor endemic countries, with only limited resources, species\nidentification based on PCR and sequencing or PCR and\nrestriction endonuclease analyses is still expensive; hence, efforts\nhave been made to perform species identification of the causal\nagents of mycetoma through cheaper methods. One such method\nis the Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) technique, which is\ndesigned to identifySc. boydii and is based on the amplification of\nthe ITS region with pan-fungal primers (Table 3). After\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 8 July 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e2918\namplification, species identification is performed by hybridizing\nspecies-specific padlock probes to the amplified ITS product and\nligated [70]. By adding the pan-fungal RCA primers and theBst\nDNA polymerase, species-specific amplification is performed for\n60 minutes at 65uC. If amplification occurs, the result can be\nanalysed on gels. Unfortunately this procedure still relies on the\namplification of the ITS gene, and for some endemic countries, the\nthermocyclers needed to perform the PCR are not routinely\navailable. The Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)\nmethod was developed for the identification ofSc. boydii (Table 4)\n[69]. Genomic DNA can be amplified using this technique by\nadding the six primers listed in Table 4 andBst DNA polymerase\nand incubating for 60 minutes at an isothermal temperature of\n63uC [69]. The resulting product can be visualised either by Gel-\nelectrophoresis or by visual observation after the addition of SYBR\ngreen. This method is suitable for species identification in endemic\nFigure 5. Identifying mycetoma causative agents by culture.A: Madurella mycetomatisgrown on sabouraud agar.

Clinical\nexamination and different imaging techniques can determine the\nextent of the disease and, to some extent, its type. A first indication\nof the causative agent can be obtained by isolating grains from\nlesions with a fine needle aspirate. Further assessment can be\nachieved by simply looking at the color of grains. More reliable\ndata can be gleaned by looking at grains histologically, but the\ndefinite identification of causative agents of mycetoma should be\ndone only after culture and preferably by using appropriate\nmolecular tools.\nThe main drawback of molecular-based diagnostic tools is that\nthey usually have to be performed in large diagnostic centers, such\nas referral hospitals in Mexico or specialized clinics in Sudan.\nSince most of the patients do not live near such health facilities,\nexpensive travel is often necessary. Efforts need to be made to\ndevelop easy bedside and field-based diagnostic tools to aid in the\nidentification of causative agents to the species level and to\nprescribe proper treatment accordingly. For this, comparative\ngenomics of the already sequenced genomes ofN. brasiliensis [71]\nand S. somaliensis [72], and the genomes of other causative agents\nwhich might be sequenced in the future will provide essential data\nfor developing species-specific identification tools. Procedures\nalready useful for such bedside implications include the LAMP-\nbased molecular diagnostic tools forSc. boydii and agglutination\nbased serological tools.\nReferences\n1.

Imaging\ntechniques can be used to detect the extent of lesions\nand help in planning appropriate treatment strategies.\nN Culture methods are still considered to be the gold\nstandard in species identification of the causal agents of\nmycetoma; however, some agents are difficult to identify\nby morphology alone. Furthermore, most culture meth-\nods are time consuming, contamination is common, and\nexperience is needed to read results accurately.\nN Histology, cytology, skin test, and serology have been\ndeveloped to aid in species identification, but most of\nthese assays appeared not specific enough to identify\nthe causative agent to the species level.\nN At the moment only molecular methods are able to\nidentify the causative agent to the species level reliably.\nHowever these methods are usually too expensive for\nthe endemic countries. Therefore fast and cheap\ndiagnostic tools need to be developed to enable early\ncase detection, thereby enhancing the change of a\nbetter therapeutic outcome.\nTop Five Papers in the Field\nN Abd El Bagi ME (2003) New radiographic classification of\nbone involvement in pedal mycetoma.
