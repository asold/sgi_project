Schmid1,2*,S t e f a nG r o b1,2 and Ueli Grossniklaus1,2\nAbstract\nBackground: The study of nuclear architecture using Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technologies is a\nnovel frontier in biology. With further reduction in sequencing costs, the potential of Hi-C in describing nuclear\narchitecture as a phenotype is only about to unfold. To use Hi-C for phenotypic comparisons among different cell\ntypes, conditions, or genetic backgrounds, Hi-C data processing needs to be more accessible to biologists.\nResults: HiCdat provides a simple graphical user interface for data pre-processing and a collection of higher-level\ndata analysis tools implemented in R. Data pre-processing also supports a wide range of additional data types\nrequired for in-depth analysis of the Hi-C data (e.g. RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and BS-Seq).\nConclusions: HiCdat is easy-to-use and provides solutions starting from aligned reads up to in-depth analyses.\nImportantly, HiCdat is focussed on the analysis of larger structural features of chromosomes, their correlation to\ngenomic and epigenomic features, and on comparative studies. It uses simple input and output formats and can\ntherefore easily be integrated into existing workflows or combined with alternative tools.\nKeywords: Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C), Nuclear architecture, Hi-C, Data analysis, Sample comparison,\nStructural domains, Correlation to (epi-)genome\nBackground\nThe development of Chromosome Conformation Capture\n(3C) techniques and their high throughput derivatives\n(e.g., 4C and Hi-C) has enabled the analysis of nuclear\narchitecture (i.e. chromatin organization) at an unprece-\ndented resolution [1]. Hi-C data analysis comprises a\nlarge variety of approaches, including point-to-point loop-\ning interactions (e.g., promoter-enhancer interactions),\nthree-dimensional modeling of chromatin [2], identifica-\ntion of structural domains (e.g., topologically associated\ndomains, TADs [3]), or comparison of different genetic\nbackgrounds (e.g., wild-typeversus mutant tissues [4–6]).\nThe large number of reads produced by Hi-C experi-\nments (e.g., around 200–300 mio aligned read-pairs per\nsample in [3]) requires efficient tools for processing,\nfiltering, and simplification of the data to best match\n*Correspondence: marcschmid@gmx.ch\n1Institute of Plant Biology, University of Zurich, Zollikerstrasse 107, 8008\nZürich, Switzerland\n2Zurich-Basel Plant Science Center, Universitätstrasse 2, 8092 Zürich,\nSwitzerland\nthe demands of the downstream analyses. Several open-\nsource tools are available, each with its own scope and\nrequirements. HiCUP [7] performs mapping and qual-\nity control on Hi-C data but no downstream analysis.\nSushi [8] and HiTC [9] provide data visualization func-\ntionality, but no pre-processing or statistical analysis of\nHi-C data. HiCseg specifically focusses on identification\nof domains in Hi-C data [10]. ChromoR [11] offers data\npre-processing and sample comparison, but does not sup-\nport the analysis of additional genomic and epigenomic\nfeatures. HiCpipe [12] implements a computationally very\nintense normalization method, which does not perform\nbetter than the parametric approach in HiCNorm [13]\n(normalization method). HOMER [14] and hiclib [15]\noffer a large variety of functionalities, including pre-\nprocessing and higher-level data analysis. However, these\ntools may be inaccessible to users with limited program-\nming experience: HOMER requires some command-line\nskills and only generates plain-text output, which needs to\nbe further processed by the user; hiclib requires familiarity\nwith Python. The latter is less well known among molecu-\nlar biologists and geneticists who are likely more familiar\n© 2015 Schmid et al.Open AccessThis article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the\nCreative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Alternatively, HiBrowse offers many functionali-\nties in an easy-to-use web-interface [16], which, however,\nconstrains the users by forcing them to adhere to the avail-\nable procedures and the requirement of uploading their\ndata to a web server.\nEnvisioning nuclear architecture (i.e. chromatin orga-\nnization) as an ordinary phenotype of an organism or a\nspecific tissue type (e.g. like the transcriptome), compara-\ntive Hi-C experiments may soon be of very broad interest,\nraising the need for data analysis tools that are not only\nwell-accessible to bioinformaticians. We therefore devel-\noped HiCdat. It includes a fast and easy-to-use GUI tool\nfor Hi-C data pre-processing and an R [17] package, which\nimplements all data analysis approaches employed in [5].\nImplementation\nHiCdat was developed with a focus on speed, user-\nfriendliness, and flexibility in terms of file formats. The\nGUI tool for data pre-processing serves to convert large-\nscale genomic and epigenomic data into simple tables,\nwhich can be efficiently loaded and processed within R.\nThe R-package provides a collection of functions, which\nallow higher-level data analysis (e.g., as in [5]) with only a\nfew lines of code. Data formats are kept as simple as possi-\nble to ensure that the user can easily integrate HiCdat into\na pre-existing workflow or combine it with other tools.\nResults and discussion\nHiCdat is divided into two parts (Fig. 1): (i) a GUI tool\nfor data pre-processing (termedHiCdatPre) and (ii) an R-\npackage for higher-level data analysis (termedHiCdatR).\nData pre-processing withHiCdat\nHiCdat takes as input two alignment files (forward and\nreverse reads, hereafter termed read-ends) in BAM format\n(Binary Alignment/Map), a reference genome, and vari-\nous data types from additional experiments (e.g., genome\nannotation, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, BS-Seq data). There are\nfive automated steps during data pre-processing: (i) pair-\ning aligned reads, (ii) creating fragments, (iii) mapping of\nread-ends to fragments, (iv) processing data from addi-\ntional experiments, and (v) creating organism-specific\nR-code.\nPairing aligned reads\nThe read-ends are first aligned seperately to the reference\ngenome using, for example, Subread [18]. Uniquely align-\ning read-ends are then paired based on their common read\nname to create read-paris (around 12.6 million read-ends\nper minute1).\nCreating fragments\nHi-C data analysis can either be carried out on restric-\ntion fragments or genomic bins with fixed size. Both types\nof fragments can be created by supplying the reference\ngenome sequence and one or more restriction enzymes or\naf i x e db i ns i z e .\nMapping read-ends to fragments\nTo calculate the interaction frequency between two frag-\nments, the read-pairs are first mapped to the fragments’\ncoordinates and then summarized as number of inter-\nactions per fragment pair (around 7.5 million read-pairs\nper minute1). During this procedure, the read-pairs can\noptionally be filtered using the approach proposed by\n[19]. Read-pairs with each end aligning at the oppo-\nsite strand are thereby removed if they are too close to\neach other. There are two cases: (i) A read-pair where\nthe two ends point towards each other (“inward-pair”),\nand (ii) a read-pair where the two ends point away from\neach other (“outward-pair”). Inward-pairs spanning only\na short region may be caused by uncut DNA. Outward-\npairs spanning only a short region can be a result of\nself-ligation.\nProcessing data from additional experiments\nTo analyze the interplay between the Hi-C interactome\nand genomic/epigenomic features, a large variety of such\ninformation can be automatically added to the fragments.\nIn principle there are two fundamentally different types\nof data: counts and densities. During higher-level data\nanalysis, counts are generally log-transformed, whereas\ndensities are kept as percentages. Likewise, if data are\nsummarized over multiple fragments (e.g. to obtain the\nannotation for 1 Mb bins directly from the fragment\nannotation), counts are summed up, whereas densities\nare averaged. Both data types comprise two sub-types,\nresulting in four different types of “tracks” which can be\nprocessed: (i) genome annotation features (e.g., genes and\ntransposons), (ii) short count features (e.g., RNA-Seq and\nsmallRNA-Seq), (iii) density features (e.g., ChIP-Seq), and\n(iv) DNA-methylation density (e.g., BS-Seq).\nGenome annotation features (GFF/GTF files with mul-\ntiple feature types per file) can generally be very long\nand possibly span multiple fragments. The number of ele-\nments per fragment is therefore counted as follows: If the\nfeature spans the entire fragment, a value of 1 is added. If\nthe feature only partly overlaps (or is within) the fragment,\na value of 0.5 is added. In contrast, short count features\n(BAM files with one feature type only) are mostly entirely\nwithin a fragment and are therefore simply summed up\nper fragment.\nD e n s i t yo fac e r t a i nf e a t u r e( B A Mf i l e sw i t ho n ef e a t u r e\ntype only) is calculated as the number of bases covered\nby at least one element (e.g. short read) divided by the\nlength of the fragment (times 100 to obtain percentages).\nLikewise, DNA cytosin-methylation density corresponds\nto the percentage of methylated C’s per fragment.\nSchmid et al.

(a-b) After sequencing and initial quality checks have been performed, the read-ends (f: forward, r: reverse) are\naligned separately to a reference genome. (c-d) After pairing the separately aligned read-ends, each end is mapped to genomic fragments, which\nare either genomic bins with a fixed size or restriction fragments with variable size. (e) Genomic fragments can be associated with various data types\nto test for correlation and enrichment of Hi-C data with genomic and epigenomic features. (f) Finally, the data can be conveniently analyzed in R\nusing HiCdatR\nSchmid et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2015) 16:277 Page 4 of 6\nCreating the organism-specific R-code\nHigher-level data analysis requires some organism-\nspecific R-code, which can be obtained by supplying the\nreference genome sequence and the restriction enzyme(s)\nused for the Hi-C library preparation.\nData analysis withHiCdatR\nIn-depth Hi-C data analysis is done in R withHiCdatR.\nThe only inputs required are the interaction counts per\nfragment pair and, optionally, the annotation of the frag-\nments holding the genomic and epigenomic tracks. For\nmost of the functions, it is furthermore possible to sup-\nply tables specifying genomic regions of interest (e.g.\nchromosome arms or pericentromeres as in [5]). The\nfunctionalities include (i) data normalizations as pro-\nposed by [13, 20, 21], (ii) sample correlation matrices,\n(iii) data visualization, (iv) sample comparisons, (v) cal-\nculation of distance decay exponents, (vi) principle com-\nponent analysis (PCA) including correlation of the first\nprinciple component to genomic and epigenomic features,\n(vii) test for increased interaction frequencies between\ngenomic regions of interest compared to randomly sam-\npled regions, and (viii) test for enrichment or depletion of\ngenomic and epigenomic features within genomic regions\nof interest compared to randomly chosen regions.\nData normalization\nMultiple data normalization strategies have been propo-\nsed and implemented in various languages and pack-\nages [11–13, 15, 20, 21]. Three of them have been\nre-implemented in HiCdat: (i) the distance ( intra-\nchromosomal interactions) and coverage ( inter-\nchromosomal interactions) normalization described in\n[20], (ii) the iterative coverage normalization proposed by\n[21], and (iii) the more sophisticated but highly efficient\nnormalization using Poisson regression as implemented in\nHiCNorm [13], which performs similar or better [11, 13]\nthan the procedures from [12, 15].\nSample correlation\nTo visualize the similarities between samples and repli-\ncates, HiCdat uses sample correlation matrices. Corre-\nlation between two samples is thereby calculated as the\naverage, or median, correlation between all the individual\nbins of the interaction matrices (i.e. the virtual 4C tracks,\nsee Additional file 1: Figure S1).\nData visualization\nHi-C interaction frequencies and differences between\nmultiple samples are visualized as heatmap-like images.\nIndividual samples can either be displayed natively (i.e.\nwith their normalized interaction frequencies, Additional\nfile 2: Figure S2) or in a correlated manner (Additional\nfile 3: Figure S3).\nSample comparison\nThree different approaches to compare two samples to\neach other are implemented. In a first approach, the\ndifference of a given fragment pair between the two sam-\nples is divided by the average interaction frequency among\nthe two samples resulting in “relative differences” [4]\n(Additional file 4: Figure S4). Considering that neighbor-\ning genomic regions are physically linked to each other,\nit is likely that they change accordingly. To visualize\nthese domains, the relative differences can be correlated\nto each other (“correlated differences” , Additional file 5:\nFigure S5). The disadvantage of these approaches is that\nthey rely on visual inspection of the difference matri-\nces. To estimate the significance of the difference and\nidentify the affected regions, we introduced signed dif-\nference matrices (SDMs) [5]. Additionally, they also pro-\nvide an overall estimate of the extent and significance\nof the difference between two samples (Additional file 6:\nFigure S6).\nCalculation of distance decay exponents (IDEs)\nThe extent to which interaction frequencies change\ndependent on the distance to a given point in the genome\ncan be characterized with the interaction decay exponent\n(IDE). IDEs are calculated as the slope of a linear fit to\nthe average interaction frequencies observed at given dis-\ntances (both log-transformed, Additional file 7: Figure S7).\nIDEs were initially used to predict the folding principles\nof the human genome using two polymer-folding models\n(the fractal and equilibrium globule module, respectively),\nwhich result in distinct values for the expected IDE [20].\nAlternatively, they can also be used to describe differ-\nences between certain sub-compartments of the genome,\nor between samples [5].\nIdentification of structural domains using principle\ncomponent analysis (PCA)\nThe correlation between the interactomes of different\ngenomic regions can be used to identify larger com-\npartments [20] or structural domains [5]. The approach\nrelies on principal component analysis (PCA) of the\ndistance-normalized and correlated intra-chromosomal\ninteractions (Additional file 8: Figure S8). The first prin-\ncipal component (FPC) can then be used to differenti-\nate for example the A and B compartments in Homo\nsapiens [20], or loose and compact structural domains\nin Arabidopsis thaliana [5]. The interplay between the\nFPC and the epigenomic/genomic landscape can be ana-\nlyzed with two methods: (i) either by using the built-in\ncor.test() [17] function to test for significance of cor-\nrelation between FPC and the density/count of a given\nfeature (Additional file 9: Figure S9), or (ii) by using an\napproach in which the fragments are split into two groups\naccording to the sign of the FPC (Additional file 10:\nSchmid et al. BMC Bioinformatics (2015) 16:277 Page 5 of 6\nFigure S10, Additional file 11: Figure S11). Enrichment\nof a given feature can then be calculated as the ratio\nof the average density/count in one over the other\ngroup, and tested for significance using a two-sided\nWilcoxon rank sum test [5]. For the identification of\nmore refined structural domains, as for example topo-\nlogically associated domains (TADs), HiCdatR provides a\nsimple wrapper around the HiCseg package [10]. Its algo-\nrithm relies on two-dimensional segmentation to identify\ncis-interacting regions, and the results were shown to\nbe in good concordance with biologically confirmed\nregions [10].\nTesting selected regions for increased interaction frequency\nand enrichment/depletion of epigenomic/genomic features\nGiven a set of genomic regions of interest, HiCdat can test\nfor increased interaction frequencies between the regions\nof interest compared to randomly sampled regions. Con-\nsidering that the interactome can be strongly influenced\nby the linear position of a certain region along the chro-\nmosome (e.g. close to telomere or centromere), or the\nchromosome number itself [5, 22], random sampling is\nperformed in a “balanced” fashion: Within each random\nset, the randomly chosen regions reflect the numbers,\nas well as the locations, of the regions of interest. The\nprocedure creates an empirical distribution of interac-\ntion frequencies between random sets, which can then\nbe used to calculate an empirical P-value (one-sided)\nfor the enrichment of interactions between the sets of\ninterest [5]. The same sampling approach can be applied\nto test for enrichment or depletion of epigenomic or\ngenomic features within a set of genomic regions of\ninterest.\nConclusions\nIn short, HiCdat allows rapid Hi-C data analysis as\ndescribed in [5], requiring only little programming expe-\nrience. The focus lies on the identification of larger\nstructural features of chromosomes, their interplay with\nthe epigenomic/genomic landscape, and on comparative\nstudies. Input and output is kept as simple as possible to\nenable easy integration into pre-existing workflows, or the\ncombination of a part of the tool with another tool.\nAvailability and requirements\n• Project name:HiCdat\n• Project home page:github.com/MWSchmid/HiCdat\n• Operating systems:Windows (7), MacOSX (> 10.8),\nUbuntu-like Linux distributions (all 64 bit)\n• Programming language:C++ and R\n• Other requirements:R-packages: randomizeBE,\ngplots, MASS, HiCseg [10]\n• License: GNU GPL v3\n• Any restrictions to use by non-academics:None\nEndnote\n1 Run-times were measured on a 64 bit Kubuntu\nrunning on an Intel Core i7 930@2.8 GHz with 24 Gb\nRAM and a 7’200 rpm Samsung HDD using Hi-C data\nfrom mouse embryonic stem cell (GSM862720,\nGSM862721) and cortex (GSM862750, GSM862751)\nsamples from [3] (NCBI37 assembly, and 1 Mb bins for\nthe higher-level data analysis, and 823’377HindIII\nrestriction fragments for mapping to fragments).\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1.Correlation between five samples of\nArabidopsis thalianaseedlings [4, 5] aligned with either Bowtie [23], Bowtie\n2 [24], or Subread [18], and processed with either HiCdat or hiclib [15] using\na resolution of 100 kb.
