A growing amount of evidence\nsuggests that the acquisition of knowledge about object use and\nfunction through observation is not the privilege of human subjects\n[2]. Yet, the richness and complexity of our technology suggests\nthat we are particularly well adapted for such competence [3–6]. It\nhas been argued that this competence arises from a set of\ninterpretative and learning predispositions that allows human\nobservers to i) decode kinematic information into the causal\nrelationships between a behavioral sequence and its result [7], ii)\ninterpret biological movements performed by others as ‘rational’\n(i.e. assuming that the most optimal actions means are adopted to\nachieve a particular goal) [8], and iii) accumulate knowledge from\npast observations about an agent’s intentions and behaviors, and\nuse this database in order to predict future events [9–13].\nTogether, these mechanisms would enable human observers to\nderive knowledge about the possible uses and functions of a tool\nfrom observing goal-directed, intentional movements performed\nby an agent [14–16]. In this article we posit that these\nsophisticated learning skills could also benefit from simpler\nheuristics allocated to the detection of low-level, local sources of\ninformation, such as the manipulative properties of objects [17].\nThese properties, called ‘affordances’, are not intrinsic to objects\nbut depend on their possible interactions with agents [18]. In its\nextended form [19] an affordance defines a relational property\nthat emerges from matching the perceived physical features of an\nobject (e.g. size, shape, texture, density) and the agent’s\nbiomechanical architecture, her goals, plans, values, beliefs, and\npast experiences. They are also described as dispositional states of\nthe agent’s nervous system [20]. Critically, affordances ‘suggest’\nhow one may interact with an object [21,22]. For example, the size\nand shape of a softball mean that it fits into the human hand, and\nits density and texture make it perfect for throwing. We posit that\nobject affordances contribute to delineating the number of\npotential motor acts that can be performed on a given object.\nThey do this by generating effector-dependent, biomechanical\npriors which are in line with the agent’s bodily architecture [17].\nThese priors then bias individuals to act on objects with the aim of\nbiomechanical optimization. In both human and non-human\nprimates, preferentially performed behaviors are generally those\nthat minimize the muscular and/or articulator costs, given the\nobject’s affordances and the desired outcome [23–26].\nCrucially, this minimization of costs also transfers to tool use\nlearning. A prominent example is provided by our extensive\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39629\ntechnologies. Humans deliberately manufacture tools whose\ncomplex physical attributes offer naı ¨ve users affordances that\nenable the extraction of their functions at low cost [27–29].\nInterestingly, the evolution of human technology might have\nincreased the utility of simple heuristics such as affordance\ndetection, in order to facilitate the highly demanding cognitive\nproblem of tool use learning [28,30–32]. In our technological\nenvironments, the detection of affordances might thus play a\ncrucial role in the acquisition of tool use skills through individual\n(i.e. trial-and-error learning) as well as social learning (i.e., learning\nfrom observing another agent’s behaviors). Perceiving affordances\nmay thus facilitate the extraction of functional features associated\nwith an object manipulated by a third party [16]. For example,\nbased on the amplitude of the observed agent’s grip aperture and\nthe orientation of her wrist, as well as on the size and texture of the\nobject to be grasped, one may predict whether this object is meant\nto be lifted, pushed, or merely transported [11]. As suggested\nabove, agents are expected to adopt tool-use behaviors that\nminimize biomechanical costs. Therefore, learning of a tool\nfunction through observation should be facilitated when a\ndemonstrator uses a tool in a way that fit the observer’s\nbiomechanical expectations (behaviors that minimize the muscular\nand/or articulator costs), and should be jeopardized in the case\nwhere these expectations are patently violated (behaviors that\nincrease the muscular and/or articulator costs).\nExpert tool users, like tool learners, may also benefit from past\nexperience in their daily interactions with objects [33]. It has been\nwidely demonstrated that naı¨ve human observers form knowledge\n(e.g. about tools and their potential use) by taking advantage of\nstatistical regularities gathered from past observations [9–13]. The\nmore times an individual associates a certain observed goal (e.g.\nthe achieved tool function) with a certain observed action (e.g. the\nway of achieving the tool function), the more likely she is to expect\nthat they will be seen together again [34]. These ‘probabilistic’\npriors, acquired from past experiences, are crucial when the\nbiomechanical information conveyed by tool affordances is too\nambiguous or noisy to sufficiently constraint the range of\ncandidate functions. Conversely, reference to biomechanical priors\nthat are generated by tool affordances may be required when the\nuse of the current tool cannot be based on previous experiences.\nCritically, both these classes of priors may be recruited when\nsensory information conveyed by movement kinematics is too\nincomplete to predict how an agent is most likely to behave. This\noccurs when many competing intentions are equally congruent\nwith the not-yet completed behavior [11].\nWhile the contribution of both these classes of priors to the\nindividual-learning of tools’ functions and use has long been\ndemonstrated, it is not yet clear whether, and how, they may both\ncombine to enable social learning of tool use (i.e., learning from\nobserving another agent’s behaviors). Here, we directly addressed\nthis question in a task that required participants to predict, under\nvarious conditions of visual uncertainty, the intentions of a\ndemonstrator who was using a multi-purpose tool. Affordance-\nrelated priors (termed ‘biomechanical’ priors) and priors acquired\nfrom past observations (termed ‘probabilistic’ priors) were\nmanipulated by varying the biomechanical optimality of the tool\nbehaviors and the probability (low versus high) of observing optimal\nversus suboptimal tool behavior.\nWe hypothesized that both biomechanical and probabilistic\npriors would have an effect on prediction. First, participants\nshould be more accurate in predicting optimal than suboptimal\nbehaviors (biomechanical bias). Second, participants should be\nmore accurate in predicting behaviors that are most likely to occur\nthroughout a specific experimental session (probabilistic bias).\nThird, we expected an interaction between these two classes of\npriors, whereby participants would preferentially respond towards\nthe biased behaviors when the probabilistic bias is assigned to\noptimal behaviors. Finally, we expected this effect to vary as a\nfunction of the amount of visual uncertainty conveyed by the\naction being performed. Thus, the propensity to respond towards\nthe biased behaviors should be strengthened as the amount of\nvisual information shown in the action videos decreases.\nMethods\nParticipants\nTwenty-four healthy volunteers (mean age = 26.5, SD = 4.40)\ntook part in an action prediction task. All were right-handed, naı¨ve\nto the purpose of the experiment, and reported normal or\ncorrected-to-normal visual acuity. The experimental protocol was\nperformed with approval of the University of Bologna –\nDepartment of Psychology – ethical committee and in accordance\nwith the Declaration of Helsinki (2008) [35]. All participants gave\ntheir verbal and informed consent to participate in the study.\nOwing to the non-invasive, purely behavioral nature of our study\n(without any emotional stimuli), the University of Bologna –\nDepartment of Psychology – ethical committee considered verbal\nconsent was appropriate and approved this consent procedure.\nSocio-demographic information (full name, age, sex, gender,\nhandedness, education) has been collected for each subject on a\nseparate sheet. The sheet contained an ‘‘Approve’’ box that was\nchecked by the experimenter after the subject gave their verbal\nconsent to participate.\nStimuli\nStimuli consisted in movies featuring a demonstrator acting on a\ntwo-purpose tool. The tool consisted of a movable handle screwed\nonto the lid of a box. The handle offered two distinct affordances\nenabling the demonstrator to grasp the object with a power or a\nprecision grip (see fig. 1). Using either grip, the demonstrator could\nachieve two intentions: Opening the box by lifting the handle(intention\nO); Switching on the light by rotating the handle(intention S) (see fig. 1).\nTwo movie formats were displayed, both having a total duration\nof 2000 msec (see fig. 1): a complete format in which actions lasted\nuntil the achievement of the underlying intention (the grasp and\nthe demonstrator’s final intention were apparent); an incomplete\nformat in which action course stopped 800 msec after movement\nonset (only the grip was apparent but the demonstrator’s final\nintention was not) while the last displayed frame was presented on\nthe screen for the remaining 1200 msec.\nAll movies were equalized for temporal homogeneity in such a\nway that the duration of the sub-steps of each action involved the\nsame number of video frames (sub-step 1: static hand to physical\ncontact with the tool = 1000 ms; sub-step 2: physical contact with\nthe tool to action end-state = 1000 ms).\nGeneral Procedure\nParticipants sat in front of a monitor on which video clips that\nshowed a male demonstrator acting on a tool were displayed (see\nfig. 1). The entire experiment was composed of three distinct\nexperimental sessions. In each session, participants had a different\nprobability of observing the demonstrator achieving his intentions\nusing an optimal (cost-free) or a suboptimal (high cost) behavioral\nstrategy [33].\nFor each of the three sessions, 4 blocks of 24 complete action\nmovies were interleaved with 4 blocks of 12 incomplete action\nmovies. Crucially, the probabilistic bias was exclusively assigned\nduring the complete action movie blocks, where participants could\nObject Affordances and Tool-Use Learning\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39629\nbenefit from a high amount of visual information to identify the\ndemonstrator’s intentions. In contrast, in the incomplete action\nmovies the amount of visual information was too low for the\nobserver to unambiguously infer the demonstrator’s intention.\nThus, blocks of complete action movies were used to generate\nprior expectations in favour of either the optimal or the suboptimal\nbehavioral strategy. These expectations were induced through\nbiased probabilistic exposure. In contrast, blocks of incomplete\nmovies were used to test the effect of each type of bias\n(probabilistic and biomechanical biases) on the participants’\ndecisions when confronted with visually uncertain action scenes\n(see [11], for a similar procedure).\nFor each of the 144 action movies, participants were required to\npredict the demonstrator’s intention by pressing, with their right\nindex and middle fingers, one of two adjacent computer keys\ncorresponding to the two possible intentions. The procedure used\nwas a self-paced procedure: participants were instructed to make\ntheir response as soon as they thought they had enough visual\ninformation to produce an accurate response. However, note that\nboth complete and incomplete movies ran until completion\nindependently of the subject’s response.\nTypical trial\nAll trials started with a white fixation-cross that appeared for\n1000 msec on a dark background. The fixation cross was\nimmediately followed by either a complete or an incomplete\naction movie (see above for further details). After each decision,\nresponse time was displayed on the screen for 500 msec. For those\ntrials in which participants did not respond, or responded too late,\n‘NO RESPONSE’ was displayed on the screen. The next trial\nstarted immediately after the 500 msec visual feedback period.\nThis feedback allowed us to avoid a ‘guessing bias’ that could\noccur during the presentation of complete action sequences, and\nthat could hinder the integration of the probabilistic bias (see [11],\nfor a similar procedure). The presentation of stimuli and recording\nof responses (correct/incorrect and response times) was synchro-\nnized using E-prime2 software (Psychology Software Tools, Inc,\nUSA).\nBiomechanical priors\nThe four possible action combinations (2 grips |2 intentions)\nwere divided into two types of behavioral category (optimal versus\nsuboptimal) on the basis of their low or high biomechanical cost.\nThis procedure allowed us to manipulate biomechanical priors\nemerging from perceived affordances (see fig. 1):\ni) Optimal behaviors. Using the power grip to achieve the\nintention of opening the box by lifting the handle was cost-free, as\nwas using the precision grip to achieve the intention of switching\nthe lights on by turning the handle. These two combinations were\nidentified as optimal behaviors (low biomechanical cost).\nii) Suboptimal behaviors. The precision grip increased the\ncost of achieving the intention of opening the box, whereas the\nFigure 1. Examples of the four combinations ‘grip| intention’ that participants encountered during the experiment, and\nthat lead to ‘optimal’ or ‘suboptimal’ behaviors.All combinations began with the demonstrator’s static hand. The actor could then use\neither a ‘power’ or a ‘precision’ grip to achieve either the intention ofOpening the box(O) orSwitching the lights on(S). The combination between the\nkind of grip and the kind of final intention resulted in the complete action as being labeled biomechanically optimal (OPTIMAL) or suboptimal\n(SUBOPTIMAL). Whereas the complete action movies lasted until the achievement of the underlying intention for a total duration of 2000 msec, the\nincomplete action movies stopped 800 msec after the movement onset (when the demonstrator was about to grasp the tool) while the last\ndisplayed frame remained on the screen for a duration of 1200 msec, so that observers had information about the grip but no information (on that\ntrial) about the demonstrator’s intention.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039629.g001\nObject Affordances and Tool-Use Learning\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39629\npower grip increased the cost of achieving the intention of\nswitching on the lights. These two combinations were identified as\nsuboptimal behaviors (high biomechanical cost).\nThe biomechanical cost of action movies were pre-tested on 10\nnaı¨ve individuals. They were asked to estimate the muscular and/\nor articulator cost of each perceived movement on a 5-point Likert\nscale (ranging from 0 = null cost to 5 = very high cost). As\nexpected, optimal behaviors (precision grip/switching-on the lights\nand power grip/opening the box, mean score = 1.01) were\nestimated as significantly less costly than suboptimal ones\n(precision grip/opening the box and power grip/switch-\ningsssssssss-on the lights, mean score = 3.13) (two-tailed t-test for\npaired data: t = 220.87, p,.0001). It is of note that the intentions\nachieved with a precision grip were rated as less costly than those\nachieved with a power grip for both optimal (precision grip/\nswitching-on the lights, mean score = 0.55, versus power grip/\nopening the box, mean score = 1.47; two-tailed t-test for paired\ndata: t = 254.83, p ,.0001) and suboptimal behaviors (precision\ngrip/opening the box, mean score = 2.90, versus power grip/\nswitching-on the lights, mean score = 3.37; two-tailed t-test for\npaired data: t = 230.82, p,.0001).\nProbabilistic priors\nUnbeknownst to the participants, the probability of observing\nthe demonstrator using an optimal or a suboptimal behavioral\nstrategy was varied within the three distinct experimental sessions\n(‘baseline’, ‘convergent bias’, ‘divergent bias’ – see below). Varying the\nprobability distributions of each possible strategy allowed us to\nmanipulate each participant’s probabilistic priors, that is, prior\nexpectations they could form about the behavioral strategy being\nfavored by the demonstrator to achieve the tool’s functions. After\neach participant performed the task, we controlled for the extent\nto which she/he was aware of the induced bias. As expected, none\nof the subjects spontaneously reported that one type of action was\nmore likely observed than another.\ni)Baseline session: no probabilistic bias. In the first\nsession, participants had an equal probability of observing the\ndemonstrator achieving his intention by performing an optimal or\na suboptimal behavior.\nii) ‘Convergent bias’ session: probabilistic bias towards\noptimal behaviors. In this session participants were biased\ntowards ‘optimal’ behaviors to the detriment of ‘suboptimal’\nbehaviors. In 80% of the ‘box opening’ trials the demonstrator\nopened the box using a power grip, and in 80% of the ‘light\nswitching’ trials he switched on the lights using a precision grip.\nHere, behaviors that were preferentially used by the demonstrator\nconverged towards the participant’s biomechanical priors.\niii) ‘Divergent bias’ session: probabilistic bias towards\nsuboptimal behaviors. In this session participants were biased\ntowards ‘suboptimal’ behaviors to the detriment of ‘optimal’\nbehaviors. In 80% of the ‘box opening’ trials the demonstrator\nopened the box using a precision grip, and in 80% of the ‘light\nswitching’ trials he switched on the lights using a power grip. Here,\nthe behaviors that were preferentially used by the demonstrator\ndiverged from the participant’s biomechanical priors.\nAll participants began the experiment with the baseline session.\nThe order of the two bias sessions (convergent and divergent) was\ncounterbalanced across participants.\nTraining phase\nPrior to the experiment participants were familiarised with the\ntask. The training consisted of an unbiased complete action movie\nblock followed by an incomplete action movie block.\nData analysis\nWe analysed the percentage of correct responses (hits) and\nresponse times (RTs) collected for both complete and incomplete\naction movies. Responses for incomplete actions were encoded as\ncorrect if the predicted intentions conformed to those that the\ndemonstrator actually achieved in their complete format. Partic-\nipants who responded too early on more than 10 percent of the\ncomplete action movies were discarded from further analyses\n(responses were considered as too early when they occurred\nbetween 0 and 1000 msec after movie onset, making accurate\npredictions impossible). Using this criterion, two subjects were\nexcluded.\nAll statistical analyses were performed separately for complete\nand incomplete action movies. The magnitude of the probabilistic\nbias and its interaction with biomechanical expectations was\ninvestigated by comparing performance during the baseline session\nwith that during the two biased sessions. The hit rates and RTs\nwere then analysed using a 2 | 2| 3 repeated-measures\nANOVAs. The first two-level factor was the ‘type of behavior’\n(optimal versus suboptimal behaviors), the second two-level factor\nwas the ‘type of grip’ (power versus precision grip), and the third,\nthree-level factor was the ‘probabilistic bias’ (baseline versus\nconvergent bias versus divergent bias). Post-hoc Fisher tests were\nused to compare performance between conditions.\nWe further investigated the learning dynamics internal to each\nsession by comparing data (hits and RTs) collected during the first\n(time-step 1) and the second half (time-step 2) of each session.\nThus, for each session, the hits rates and RTs were analysed using\n2| 2 | 2 repeated-measures ANOVAs with ‘time-step’ (time-\nstep 1 versus time-step 2), ‘type of behavior’ (optimal versus\nsuboptimal behaviors), and ‘type of grip’ (power versus precision\ngrip) as two-level factors. Post-hoc Fisher tests were used to\ncompare performance between conditions.\nFor all analyses, p ,.05 was taken as the criterion for\nsignificance and eta squared (\n ) was used as a measure of effect\nsize. Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 9 (www.\nstatsoft.com).\nResults\nOverall performance\nComplete action movies (Hits and RTs). The 2 (type of\nbehavior) |2 (type of grip) |3 (probabilistic bias) repeated-\nmeasures ANOVAs revealed a main effect of the ‘type of behavior’\non both hits (F 1,21 = 18.08, p ,.001,\n = .46) and RTs\n(F1.21 = 93.43, p,.0001,\n = .82). Participants were and faster at\npredicting optimal than suboptimal behaviors (hits: 88% vs. 81%;\nRTs: 1382 msec vs. 1444 msec). The main effect of the\n‘probabilistic bias’ was also significant on both hits (F 2,42 = 6.5,\np,.01,\n = .24) and RTs (F2.42 = 22.18, p,.0001,\n = .51). In the\ndivergent bias session, participants made more accurate predic-\ntions compared to the baseline (hits: 88% vs. 84%, p,.05) and the\nconvergent bias sessions (hits: 88% vs. 82%, p ,.001). However,\nwhen compared to baseline, RTs were faster in both the\nconvergent (1368 msec vs. 1452 msec, p,.0001) and the divergent\nbias sessions (1420 msec vs. 1452 msec, p ,.05). It is of note that a\ndifference occurred also between the two bias sessions, with faster\nRTs in the convergent bias session (1368 msec vs. 1420 msec,\np,.001). Finally, a main effect of the ‘type of grip’ was found on\nhits only (F1,21 = 23.27, p,.0001,\n = .53), with participants being\noverall more accurate at predicting behaviors that were performed\nwith a precision than a power grip (88% vs. 81%).\nThe two-way interaction ‘type of behavior’ | ‘probabilistic\nbias’ was significant for both hits (F2.42 = 19.76, p,.0001,\n = .48)\nObject Affordances and Tool-Use Learning\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39629\nand RTs (F2.42 = 31.69, p,.0001,\n = .60) (see fig. 2a,b). Post-hoc\ncomparisons (LSD Fisher tests) indicated that during the baseline\nsession – where both types of behaviors were equally probable –\nparticipants were more accurate (87.5% vs. 80%, p ,.01) and\nfaster (1411 msec vs. 1492 msec, p ,.0001) at predicting optimal\ncompared to suboptimal behaviors. A similar pattern was observed\nin the convergent bias session. Participants were more accurate\n(91% vs. 72%, p ,.0001) and faster (1308 msec vs. 1427 msec,\np,.0001) at predicting the optimal behaviors when these\nbehaviors were more frequently shown than the suboptimal ones.\nIn the divergent bias session, no differences were found between\nthe optimal and suboptimal behaviors, despite the fact that the\nlatter were more frequently shown than the former (hits = 85% vs.\n90%, p ..05; RTs = 1427 msec vs. 1414 msec, p ..05). Thus,\nincreasing the probability of observing suboptimal behaviors did\nnot significantly increase the number of correct responses for these\nbehaviors compared to the optimal ones.\nInterestingly, the interaction effect between the optimality of the\nbehavior and the probabilistic bias was further modulated by the\ntype of grip used, as revealed by a significant three-way interaction\nbetween all three factors for hits (F\n2.42 = 9.49, p,.001,\n = .31). In\nthe baseline session, the preference for optimal over suboptimal\nbehaviors was observed for power grip only (post hoc test\ncomparing optimal/power grip vs. suboptimal/power grip:\np,.0001; post-hoc test comparing optimal/precision vs. subopti-\nmal/precision grip: p ..05). In the convergent bias session,\nparticipants were impaired at predicting suboptimal over optimal\nbehaviors irrespective of the type of grip used. In the divergent\nsession, no difference between optimal and suboptimal behaviors\nwas observed, irrespective of the type of grip used.\nIncomplete action movies (Hits and RTs).The 2 (type of\nbehavior) |2 (type of grip) |3 (probabilistic bias) repeated-\nmeasures ANOVAs revealed a main effect of the ‘type of behavior’\non both hits (F1.21 = 17.19, p,.001,\n = .45) and RTs (F1.21 = 6.97,\np = .01,\n = .25); participants were more accurate and faster at\npredicting optimal than suboptimal behaviors (hits: 58% vs. 42%;\nRTs: 1176 msec vs. 1215 msec). This preference for optimal\nbehaviors significantly differed from chance (t-test for single mean\ncompared to 50, t .4.40, p ,.001).The main effect of the\n‘probabilistic bias’ was significant only for RTs (F\n2,42 = 5.75,\np,.01,\n = .21). This indicated that, compared to the incomplete\nmovie blocks of the baseline session, participants make faster\nFigure 2.

Note that they also tended to\nmake faster predictions in the incomplete movies of the divergent\nbias session (1194 msec vs. 1235 msec, p = .08). The main effect of\n‘type of grip’ was not significant (hits and RTs: all F ..33, all\np..48).\nThe two-way interaction ‘type of behavior’ | ‘probabilistic\nbias’ was significant for both hits (F\n2,42 = 9.84, p,.001,\n = .32)\nand RTs (F 2,42 = 3.34, p,.05,\n = .14) (see fig. 2c,d). As for the\ncomplete movie blocks, post-hoc comparisons (LSD Fisher tests)\nindicated that, in the baseline session, participants were more\naccurate at predicting optimal than suboptimal behaviors (59% vs.\n35%, p,.001). This preference for optimal behaviors significantly\ndiffered from chance (t-test for single mean compared to 50,\nt.3.32, p ,.01).They were also more accurate (66% vs. 36%,\np,.0001) and faster (116 msec vs. 1197 msec, p ,.001) at\npredicting optimal than suboptimal behaviors in the incomplete\naction movie blocks of the convergent bias session. Again, the\npreference for optimal behaviors was significantly different from\nchance level (t-test for single mean compared to 50, t .4.75,\np,.001). However, in the incomplete action movie blocks of the\ndivergent bias session, we did not find any differences between the\noptimal and the suboptimal behaviors, although the latter were\nmost likely observed than the former in the complete movie blocks\nthat preceded (hits = 49% vs. 55%, p ..05; RTs = 1187 msec vs.\n1202 msec, p ..05). Note that performances for both optimal (t-\ntest for single mean compared to 50, t ,20.17, p ..05) and\nsuboptimal behaviors (t-test for single mean compared to 50,\nt.1.46, p = .15) did not significantly differ from chance.\nFinally, the interaction effect between the ‘type of behavior’\nperformed (optimal vs. suboptimal) and the ‘probabilistic bias’\n(baseline vs. convergent vs. divergent) was modulated by the type\nof grip (power vs. precision) used by the demonstrator\n(F\n2,42 = 3.37, p ,.05,\n = .14). In the incomplete action movie\nblocks of the baseline and convergent bias sessions, the difference\nbetween optimal and suboptimal behaviors was observed inde-\npendently of the type of grip used. In the incomplete action movie\nblocks of the divergent bias session, a difference between optimal\nand suboptimal behaviors was observed only when both of them\nwere achieved by a precision grip (optimal/precision = 47% vs.\nsuboptimal/precision = 59%). Note that the proportion of correct\npredictions for suboptimal behaviors achieved with a precision\ngrip differed from chance (t-test for single mean compared to 50,\nt.2.38, p,.05).\nOverall performance: preliminary discussion\n(fig. 2). Results for the complete action movies demonstrate\nthat, compared to baseline, the probabilistic bias significantly\nimproved participants’ performance – as also indicated by faster\nreaction times in the two bias sessions. Note that the rate of correct\nresponses was overall higher in the divergent session. This is easily\nexplained by the fact that, in the convergent session, the\nprobabilistic bias assigned to optimal behaviors concomitantly\nincreased the errors rate for unbiased (i.e., suboptimal) behaviors.\nIn contrast, the probabilistic bias assigned to suboptimal behaviors\ndid not alter the participants’ ability to accurately predict the\nunbiased (i.e., optimal) behaviors. Thus, the higher the probability\nthat a behavior occured, the better and faster it was predicted,\nirrespective of its type (optimal or suboptimal). These results\nindicate that, as expected, participants were successful in\nintegrating the probability distributions of both convergent and\ndivergent bias sessions.\nThe second set of results shows that the biomechanical\nconstraints generated by the detection of tool affordances play a\nmajor role in participants’ predictions: participants were more\naccurate and faster at predicting behaviors that minimized\nbiomechanical costs, irrespective of probabilities. Thus, in both\nthe complete and incomplete action movies of the baseline session\n(i.e. a session in which the demonstrator equally selected between\nthe two available behavioral strategies), participants preferentially\nchose intentions achieved by optimal behaviors rather than\nsuboptimal behaviors (see fig. 2a,b,c,d). This result demonstrates\nthat when participants cannot rely on past observations (i.e., on\nprobability) to decide how an observed agent is most likely to\nbehave, they tend to rely on their biomechanical priors by default.\nThat is, they assume that the observed agent behaves ‘rationally’,\ni.e., that he favors strategies which minimize biomechanical costs.\nThe third set of results concerns the interaction between the two\nkinds of priors (biomechanical and probabilistic) (fig. 2a,b,c,d). We\nfound that both the magnitude and dynamics of the probabilistic\nbias differed as a function of the type of behavior, with\nparticipants’ biomechanical expectations overriding the effect of\nthe probabilistic bias. Thus, in the convergent bias session\n(probabilistic bias assigned to optimal behaviors) performance\ndecreased for the suboptimal behaviors, and was facilitated for the\noptimal behaviors, as expected. This pattern of performance –\nobserved in both the incomplete movie and complete movie blocks\n– suggests that it is costly for participants to inhibit a response that\nfits with their biomechanical expectations, even though a high\namount of visual information is available. However, in the\ndivergent bias session (probabilistic bias assigned to suboptimal\nbehaviors), no significant differences were found between the two\nalternatives: participants did not preferentially choose the subop-\ntimal behavior over the optimal one, although the former was\nmore likely to be performed than the latter. This pattern suggests\nthat participants actively integrated both types of priors, by\ncombining their respective effects. Thus, when probabilistic and\nbiomechanical priors diverged, the overall effect tended to sum to\nzero, resulting in performances that did not significantly differ\nfrom chance for both optimal and suboptimal behaviors.\nFinally, we found that the type of grip used by the demonstrator\nhad an effect on the participants’ predictions when i) the\nprobability of each competing intention was equal (baseline\nsession), and ii) when the intention that was eventually achieved\nwas fully visible (complete movies). This finding can be accounted\nfor by a facilitatory effect of the precision grip. Although suboptimal\nbehaviors that were achieved with a precision grip were estimated\nas suboptimal, they were nevertheless estimated as less constrain-\ning than those performed with a power grip. Interestingly, this\nfacilitatory effect was easily overcome by the probabilistic bias,\nsince it disappeared in both the convergent and divergent bias\nsessions. It is of note that this tendency to over-estimate the\noptimality of precision grips may be due to the biomechanical\ncharacteristics of the effector itself. Indeed, performing prehension\nmovements with either a power grip or a precision grip\ndifferentially affects the synergies of arm segments. While the\nachievement of a power grip exerts constraints on many degrees of\nfreedom of the arm (i.e. the wrist, elbow and shoulder) [36], the\nprecision grip offers more flexible solutions [37], independently of\nthe overall cost of the final action (e.g. opening the box with a\nprecision grip).\nLearning dynamics\nComplete action movies (Hits and RTs).i) Baseline session.\nThe 2 |2|2 repeated-measures ANOVA performed on ‘time-\nstep’ (time-step 1 vs. time-step 2),‘type of behavior’ (optimal vs.\nsuboptimal) and ‘type of grip’ (power vs. precision grip) revealed a\nmain effect of the ‘type of behavior’ for both hits (F\n1,21 = 11.57,\np,.01,\n = .36) and RTs (F 1,21 = 47.7, p ,.0001,\n = .69), with\nObject Affordances and Tool-Use Learning\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39629\noptimal behaviors being overall faster (1411 msec vs. 1493 msec)\nand more accurately predicted (88% vs. 80%) than suboptimal\nones.

The two-way\ninteraction ‘time-step’| ‘type of behavior’ was significant for hits\n(F\n1,21 = 4.91; p ,.05,\n = .19) (see fig. 3a). Post-hoc comparison\ntests (LSD Fisher tests) showed that the difference between the\npercentage of hits observed at time-step 1 for the optimal and the\nsuboptimal behaviors (90% vs. 78%; post-hoc test: p ,.0001) was\nno longer significant at time-step 2 (85% vs. 82%; post-hoc test:\np..05).

The same 2 |2|2 repeated-measures\nANOVA performed on complete movie blocks of the convergent\nbias session revealed main effects of ‘time-step’ (hits: F\n1,21 = 9.80;\np,.01,\n = .32; RTs: F 1,21 = 6.87; p,.05,\n = .25) and ‘type of\nbehavior’ (hits:F1,21 = 34.09; p,.0001,\n = .62; RTs: F1,21 = 43.61;\np,.0001,\n = .67) on both hits and RTs. Participants were more\naccurate but slower at predicting the demonstrator’s intention at\ntime-step 1 than at time-step 2 (hits = 85% vs. 78%, p ,.01); RTs\n= 1386 msec vs. 1337 msec, p ,.05). Overall, they were more\naccurate and faster at predicting likely optimal than unlikely\nsuboptimal behaviors (hits = 91% vs. 73%, p ,.0001;\nRTs = 1307 msec vs. 1416 msec, p ,.0001). A main effect of the\n‘type of grip’ was also shown on hits only (F 1,21 = 17.26; p,.001,\n= .45), revealing that participants more accurately predicted\nbehaviors performed with a precision than a power grip (87%vs.\n77%, p,.001), independently of their optimality and of the time-\nstep. Furthermore, the two-way interaction ‘time-step’ | ‘type of\nbehavior’ was significant for hits (F1,21 = 9.07; p,.01,\n = .30) (see\nfig. 3a). Post-hoc analyses (LSD Fisher tests) showed that\nthroughout the session, participants were overall more accurate\nat predicting the optimal than the suboptimal behaviors, and that\nthis advantage for optimal behaviors increased over time (time-\nstep 1 = 91% vs. 79%, p ,.001; time-step 2 = 91% vs. 66%,\np,.0001). The two-way interaction between ‘time-step’|‘type of\ngrip’ as well as the three-way interaction were not significant (hits\nand RTs: all F ,1.60, all p ..22).\niii) Divergent bias session. The same 2 |2|2 repeated-measures\nANOVA performed on complete movie blocks of the divergent\nbias session showed a main effect of ‘time-step’ (F\n1,21 = 5.04.;\np,.05,\n = .19), with better performance at time-step 1 than at\ntime-step 2 (90% vs. 85%). A main effect of the ‘type of grip’ was\nalso found on hits (F 1,21 = 6.99.; p ,.05,\n = .25), with better\nperformance for behaviors performed with a precision than a\npower grip (90% vs. 84%), irrespective of their optimality. The\ninteraction between the ‘time-step’ and ‘type of behavior’ factors\nwas significant for hits only (F\n1,21 = 6.85.; p ,.05,\n = .25) (see\nfig. 3a). In the first half of the session participants performed\nequally well (post-hoc test: p ..05) for the likely suboptimal (time-\nstep 1 = 89%) and the unlikely optimal behaviors (time-step\n1 = 91%). In the second half, however, they were more accurate\nat predicting the suboptimal behaviors (time-step 2 = 91% vs 79%;\np,.01). This was associated with decreased performance for the\nunlikely optimal behaviors throughout the session (time-step\n1 = 90% vs. time-step 2 = 79%). The main effect of ‘type of\nbehavior’, the ‘time-step’ | ‘type of grip’ interaction, and the\nthree-way interaction were not significant (hits and RTs: all\nF,3.83, all p ..06).\nIncomplete action movies (Hits and RTs). i) Baseline\nsession. The 2 |2|2 repeated-measures ANOVA performed on\n‘time-step’ (time-step 1 vs. time-step 2),‘type of behavior’ (optimal\nvs. suboptimal) and ‘type of grip’ (power vs. precision grip) showed\na main effect of the ‘type of behavior’ on hits only (F 1,21 = 17.96,\np,.001,\n = .46). In the incomplete movie blocks of the baseline\nsession, participants were more accurate at predicting optimal\n(59%) than suboptimal (35%) behaviors, independently of the\ntime-step. Neither the main effects of ‘time-step’ or ‘type of grip’,\nnor the two-way interactions ‘time-step’ | ‘type of grip’ and\n‘time-step’| ‘type of behavior’ (see fig. 3b), nor the three-way\ninteraction were significant (hits and RTs: all F ,1.21, all p..28).\nii) Convergent bias session. The same 2 |2|2 repeated-measures\nANOVA performed on incomplete movie blocks of the convergent\nbias session revealed a main effect of ‘time-step’ on RTs only\n(F1,21 = 9.53; p ,.01,\n = .31). Overall, participants responded\nslower at time-step 1 (1178 msec) than at time-step 2 (1141 msec).\nA main effect of the ‘type of behavior’ was present for both RTs\n(F1,21 = 14.11; p ,.01,\n = .40) and hits (F 1,21 = 21.17; p ,.001,\n= .50), with participants being more accurate (66% vs. 36%) and\nfaster (1116 msec vs. 1203 msec) at predicting optimal than\nsuboptimal behaviors. The main effect of the ‘type of grip’, the\n‘time-step’| ‘type of grip’ and ‘time-step’| ‘type of behavior’\ninteractions (see fig. 3b), and the three-way interaction were not\nsignificant (hits and RTs: all F ,3.77, all p ..07).\niii) Divergent bias session. The same 2 |2|2 repeated-measures\nANOVA performed on incomplete movie blocks of the divergent\nbias session showed a significant interaction between the ‘time-\nstep’ and ‘type of behavior’ on hits only (F\n1,21 = 8.39; p ,.01,\n= .27) (see fig. 3b). Post-hoc tests (LSD Fisher tests) demonstrated\nthat in the first half of the incomplete movie blocks, rates of correct\npredictions for the optimal and the suboptimal behaviors did not\ndiffer (time-step 1 = 54% vs. 54%; p ..05). However, a difference\noccurred in the second half of the incomplete movie blocks, with\nsuboptimal behaviors being more accurately predicted than\noptimal ones (time-step 2: optimal\n = 44% vs. suboptimal\n= 57%; p,.001). Of note is the fact that this effect was due to\nthe rate of correct predictions for the optimal behaviors decreasing\nover the session (time-step 1 = 54% vs. time-step 2 = 44%; p,.01).\nHowever, neither the performance for suboptimal behaviors (t-test\nfor single mean compared to 50, t ,1.47, p = .15) nor the\nperformance for optimal behaviors (t-test for single mean\ncompared to 50, t ,21.32, p = .19) significantly differed from\nchance level. No significant main effects were revealed (hits and\nRTs: all F ,1.87, all p ..19). Neither the ‘time-step’ | ‘type of\ngrip’ interaction was significant (hits and RTs: all F ,.74, all\np..40).\nLearning dynamics: preliminary discussion (fig. 3). In\nboth the baseline and the convergent bias session, analyzing the\nevolution of response patterns over time (from time-step 1 to time-\nstep 2) revealed an early preference for the optimal behaviors (see\nfig. 3a,b). This preference was already present in the first half of\nthe baseline session and did not vary further with increasing\nprobabilities. Interestingly, this preference for behaviors that\nminimized biomechanical costs seemed impervious to their\nprobabilistic likelihood sampled from past observations. This\nsuggests that biomechanical priors might short-circuit probabilistic\nsampling, and might interfere with decisions based on the\nextraction of statistical regularities.\nIn the divergent bias session (suboptimal bias), the evolution of\nthe response pattern from time-step 1 to time-step 2 suggests that\nthe absence of a difference between performance for optimal and\nsuboptimal behaviors – although the latter were more frequently\nObject Affordances and Tool-Use Learning\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39629\nshown – could be primarily due to participants’ initial preferences\nfor optimal behaviors (see fig. 3a,b). This preference progressively\ndecreased over time as the probability of observing suboptimal\nbehaviors concomitantly increased. However, overall, this increase\nwas not sufficient to compensate for the participants’ initial lack of\npreference toward suboptimal behaviors.\nFinally, it is noteworthy that the number of responses toward\noptimal versus suboptimal behaviors was overall greater in the\nincomplete, relative to the complete, action movies in both the\nbaseline and the convergent bias sessions. This difference may\naccount for the fact that the rate of hits for both the optimal and\nsuboptimal behaviors was very high in the complete movie blocks.\nTherefore, the number of responses for optimal behaviors, and\nhence the difference between the two types of behavior, could not\nfurther increase due to a ‘ceiling’ effect. Alternatively, this\ndifference may be accounted for by the fact that, in conditions\nof visual uncertainty, individuals tended to favor responses that\nwere consistent with their prior expectations. Interestingly, this\nassumption is consistent with the finding that one’s priors (here, an\nintrinsic preference for optimal behaviors) are primarily used to\ncomplement sensory uncertainty in order to allow decisions, and\nthus actions, to be made even in cases of noisy signals or sparse\ndata [11,16].\nFigure 3.

Here, we provide the first evidence that\nlow-level local cues such as object affordances influence the\nlearning and prediction of tool-use behaviors. We demonstrate\nthat biomechanical priors modulate the extent to which partici-\npants’ predictions are influenced by probabilistically-induced prior\nexpectations (see fig. 2). In particular, we found that when the\ndemonstrator’s behavior satisfied both the participants’ biome-\nchanical and probabilistic priors, the learning cost decreased, as\nparticipants efficiently combined both types of priors to make their\npredictions. Conversely, when the demonstrator’s behavior\nviolated the biomechanical but not the probabilistic priors, the\nlearning cost increased, as participants had to deal with two\nconflicting sources of prior information.\nSpecifically, the dynamics of the integration of these probabi-\nlistic expectations was strongly dependent on the biomechanical\noptimality of the observed behaviors (see fig. 3). When the\nprobabilistic bias favored suboptimal behaviors, participants\nneeded a greater number of observations to neutralize a\npreference for optimal behaviors, as well as to derive and use\nprobabilistic information to predict suboptimal behaviors. Fur-\nthermore, performance during both the baseline and the\nconvergent bias sessions showed that participants exhibited an\ninitial preference for optimal behaviors that was sustained\nthroughout the session, and did not vary with changes in\nprobabilistic bias. Interestingly, this initial preference was even\nstronger in the interrupted sequences, where subjects had little\ninformation about the demonstrator’s intention. The strong\ninfluence of biomechanical priors in these sequences suggests that\nthese priors might be primarily used in the case of noisy signals or\nsparse data. As such, they may be specifically suited to reduce the\nintrinsic uncertainty of goal-directed behaviors [16]. In sum,\nbiomechanical priors provided by the tool’s affordances acted as\nan inductive bias [13], complementing the available perceptual\ninformation when this information did not sufficiently constrain\nthe number of potential solutions (e.g. ‘opening a box’ versus\n‘switching the lights on’).\nTogether, these findings complement recent results published by\nChambon and co-workers [11]. In their study, participants were\nrequested to infer the intentions of a demonstrator who performed\nvarious actions on meaningless objects. The authors showed that\nas the amount of visual information conveyed by movement\nkinematics progressively decreased, participants responded more\nfrequently toward the intentions that had the highest probability of\noccurring. Chambon et al.’s findings are consistent with a\nBayesian estimation scheme: the less information one has about\nthe action scene, the greater the weight of one’s priors in the\ndecision. Put another way: the higher the sensory uncertainty, the\nmore the probabilistic bias is used to ‘resolve’, or ‘complement’,\nthis sensory uncertainty. Our findings suggest that the effect of\npriors gathered from probabilistic sampling of past observations\nalso depends on whether or not the visual information conveyed\nby the movement’s kinematics meets the expectations that are\ninduced by an object’s affordances.\nEven though visual information did not meet these expectations,\nparticipants tended to assume the demonstrator to behave in an\noptimal way. In other words, they expected the demonstrator to\nact as a ‘rational’ agent – i.e., an agent who adopts the most\noptimal (i.e., least costly) action means to achieve his goal given the\nconstraints of the current situation. This echoes recent evidence\nshowing that humans, even at a very early age, consider their\nconspecifics to be rational agents [8,38,39]. Thus, children may\nposit states of the world occasionally counterfactual to the\nperceptual evidence (such as the presence of occluded physical\nobjects) but consistent with a rational interpretation of the\nobserved action [40,41]. Here, we show that, rather than being\nrestricted to external, environmental aspects of reality (e.g., a ball\njumps an obstacle to reach a new location versus a ball jumps to\nreach a new location but there is no obstacle present), the\nsituational constraints through which the rational attributes of an\nobserved behavior are estimated, are extended to self-centred,\nsensorimotor properties that observers share with the observed\nagents.\nThis issue is currently debated in the literature. On one hand,\nprevious findings suggest that in early infancy such sensorimotor\ncues do not play an essential, selective role in the rational\ninterpretation of observed actions. For example, Southgate and\ncolleagues[42] showed that 6- to 8- month-old infants attributed\nrational properties to observed actions even when the movements\nused to achieve them were biomechanically impossible. In their\nstudy, rationality was defined as conditions in which the observed\ngoal-directed movements were adapted to external situational\nconstraints, independently of the biomechanical plausibility of\nthese movements. On the other hand, other evidence suggests that\na rational interpretation of goal-directed actions may be predicat-\ned upon sensorimotor information conveyed by movement\nkinematics [43]. On a similar line, Southgate and co-workers\n[44,45] recently showed that the motor system of 9- to 15-months\nold infants was activated during the prediction of observed actions.\nThe authors proposed that the activation of the motor system,\ninstead of being driven by current visual information, was driven\nby the infants’ expectations about the movements by which an\nattributed goal would likely be achieved. Given these contradicting\ndata, one may speculate that the coupling of a rational\ninterpretation of goal-directed actions with the processing of\nsensorimotor cues such as object affordances might be highly\ndependent on motor expertise acquired from experience [46].\nFurthermore, this coupling might mature later in development.\nOur results suggest that the coupling of biomechanical with\nprobabilistic priors may be particularly strong in adult observers,\npresumably equipped with a high degree of motor expertise.\nBiomechanical and probabilistic priors may recruit two different\n– and parallel – neural systems that occasionally combine to derive\ninformation about tool use and function from observation.\nHowever, the exact nature and function of these systems is still a\nmatter of conjecture. Effector-dependent, biomechanical priors\nmay exert their influence on action prediction by differently\nweighting action alternatives within the motor repertoire of\nposterior frontal cortices such that certain actions become favored\nover others according to the biomechanical constraints of the\nmotor effectors. This process of weighting action alternatives could\nbe mediated by reciprocal inhibitory connections within the motor\ncortices, either by suppressing or increasing the activity of current\ncompetitors [47]. Occasionally, probabilistic priors may exert top-\ndown influences on the selection of action alternatives within\npremotor cortices by using evidence gathered from past events to\nre-assigning new weights to the set of possible actions. Interest-\ningly, these probabilistic priors may recruit more anterior frontal\nregions, such as the dorsolateral [48] or the inferior parts [49] of\nthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. As a result, one may speculate\nthat an abnormal connectivity between dorsolateral prefrontal and\npremotor regions – resulting from an impaired biasing influence\nfrom anterior to more posterior frontal cortices – would lead to\nObject Affordances and Tool-Use Learning\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39629\nabnormal action selection [50,51]. Such abnormal selection might\njeopardize acquisition of motor expertise and the ability to infer\nother people’s intentions from observation [52].\nConclusion\nTo our knowledge, the present study provides the first evidence\nthat object affordances play a major role in the learning and\nprediction of observed tool-use behaviors. In particular, we show\nthat perceiving observed behaviors as rational depends on low-\nlevel local cues from which their biomechanical costs are estimated\nwith regard to their final goals. We suggest that biomechanical\nexpectations elicited by affordances impede or bias the extraction\nof probabilistic regularities from past events. When these statistical\nregularities favor the observation of biomechanically suboptimal\nbehaviors, biomechanical expectations delay the acquisition of\nprobabilistic priors. Consequently, they also hinder the use of these\npriors in solving the uncertainty that is associated with incomplete\nvisual signals.\nInterestingly, one may extrapolate from our results that\nincreasing the number of observations for suboptimal behaviors\nwould further boost the weight devoted to probabilistic informa-\ntion in the participants’ decisions. If this is the case what might this\nboost reflect and how might the brain represent it? Further studies\nshould investigate how, and whether, the increasing weight of\nprobabilistic information is associated with an update of biome-\nchanical priors. Such an update could occur through a mechanism\nof visuomotor learning mediated by the plastic properties of the\nmotor system [53–55]. This would allow one to determine whether\nthe interaction between a ‘rational’ interpretation of actions and\nthe detection of affordances recruits a modular, domain-specific\nprocess that would configure the experience of the external world\nper se. Implications for the social learning of tool use could be\nparticularly important, as it would suggest that the larger the\nmagnitude of this interaction for learners, the less able they would\nbe to predict and learn from biomechanically suboptimal or\nunexpected behaviors. More generally, we believe that this\ncognitive selectivity for biomechanical optimality could contribute\nto the convergence of individual behaviors towards homogeneous\npatterns [17]. This could arise in the absence of high-level, faithful\nsocial transmission mechanisms such as true imitation of observed\naction goals and means [56–58]. Affordances could enhance the\nefficiency of less precise, though less costly, forms of social learning\nstrategies in the acquisition of novel tool use, like emulation\nlearning [59] or stimulus enhancement [60].\nAcknowledgments\nWe are very grateful to Alessandro Farne`, Karen T.
