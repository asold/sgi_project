  "abstract": "Systematic reviews are a crucial tool in health research where experts carefully collect and analyze all available evidence on a specific research question. Creating these reviews is typically time- and resource-intensive, often taking months or even years to complete, as researchers must thoroughly search, evaluate, and synthesize an immense number of scientific studies. For the present article, we conducted a review to understand how new artificial intelligence (AI) tools, specifically large language models (LLMs) like Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT), can be used to help create systematic reviews in health research. We searched multiple scientific databases and finally found 37 relevant articles. We found that LLMs have been tested to help with various parts of the systematic review process, particularly in 3 main areas: searching scientific literature (41% of studies), selecting relevant studies (38%), and extracting important information from these studies (30%). GPT was the most commonly used LLM, appearing in 89% of the studies. Most of the research (57%) focused on testing whether these AI tools actually work as intended in this context of systematic review production. The results were mixed: about half of the studies found LLMs promising, a quarter were neutral, and one-fifth found them not promising. While LLMs show potential for making the systematic review process more efficient, there is still a lack of fully tested and validated applications. However, the increasing number of studies in this field suggests that these AI tools are becoming increasingly important in creating systematic reviews.",
