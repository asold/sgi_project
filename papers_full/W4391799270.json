  "abstract": "We tackle the challenge of building real-world multimodal assistants for\\ncomplex real-world tasks. We describe the practicalities and challenges of\\ndeveloping and deploying GRILLBot, a leading (first and second prize winning in\\n2022 and 2023) system deployed in the Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge. Building\\non our Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT) framework, we propose a hybrid architecture\\nthat leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialised models tuned for\\nspecific subtasks requiring very low latency. OAT allows us to define when, how\\nand which LLMs should be used in a structured and deployable manner. For\\nknowledge-grounded question answering and live task adaptations, we show that\\nLLM reasoning abilities over task context and world knowledge outweigh latency\\nconcerns. For dialogue state management, we implement a code generation\\napproach and show that specialised smaller models have 84% effectiveness with\\n100x lower latency. Overall, we provide insights and discuss tradeoffs for\\ndeploying both traditional models and LLMs to users in complex real-world\\nmultimodal environments in the Alexa TaskBot challenge. These experiences will\\ncontinue to evolve as LLMs become more capable and efficient -- fundamentally\\nreshaping OAT and future assistant architectures.\\n",
