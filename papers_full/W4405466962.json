  "full_text": "Editorial\nRevolutionizing Radiology: The Role of Large Language Models\nAjay Alex1 C. Kesavadas1\n1 Department of Imaging Sciences and Interventional Radiology,\nSCTIMST, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India\nIndian J Radiol Imaging 2025;35:1.\nSince Roentgen’s discovery of X-ray, radiology as a specialty\nhas grown by leaps and bounds, with an increasing number of\nimaging studies, including radiographs, computed tomogra-\nphy (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\nWith radiology being one of the most technologically driven\nmedical specialties, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) driven adjuncts\nhave already made great inroads and are revolutionizing how\nradiologists interpret and report imaging studies. In this\ncontext, large language models (LLMs) have also started\nentering various realms of radiological practice. LLMs are AI-\ndriven computer programs that primarily involve text analysis\nand text generation based on deep learning methods.\n1,2 Over\nthe last few decades, LLMs have evolved markedly for use in\nreal-world scenarios, thanks to the background data on which\nthese systems have been pretrained.\nLLMs can assist radiology units in optimizing workﬂows\nwith the huge number of requests for imaging being auto-\nmatically screened and prioritized for early scheduling based\non clinical requests. They can save time for radiologists in\nbeing also able to summarize clinical details, including\nrelevant laboratory investigations of patients from available\ndocuments of the patient giving us a better understanding of\nthe patient’s clinical background and differentials, thus\nensuring we get a better background clinical perspective,\nwith a resultant improved and useful imaging report gener-\nation. In this issue of the journal, there are articles evaluating\nLLMs in structured report generation in head and neck\ncancers and another on translating reports to native lan-\nguages for a better understanding.\nLLMs can also potentially change how radiology courses are\ntaught effectively. They can generate explanations for speciﬁc\nimaging ﬁndings, including the entire clinico-patho-physio-\nlogical aspects of imagingﬁndings, which will ensure trainees\ndevelop the aptitude to ensure they grow into clinical radiol-\nogists rather than just basic“image interpreters.”\nNaturally, the challenges of LLMs are considerations\nthat limit their free usage in all respects. Primarily, the\nreliability of data generated is a question that requires\ncontinuous supervision and validation since, invariably,\nLLM use would entail a critical component of patient care\nmanagement decisions. The same was analyzed between\nvarious LLMs by Sarangi et al in pulmonary embolism.\n3\nAdditionally, patient data privacy may also be an issue\nsince these would involve the transmission of medical data\nover various platforms. Bias within the LLMs may also\naffect the generated response, which in turn depends on\nt h eb a c k g r o u n dd a t ao nw h i c ht h es y s t e m sa r et r a i n e d .\nHence, the applicability of LLMs across populations may be\na concern, with Western data-driven ones being invalid\nwhen applied to an Indian subset, especially when it\ncomes to medical use.\nCertainly, LLMs will alter how a radiologist works. Un-\ndoubtedly, these will eventually improve ef ﬁciency in\nreporting and training the next generation of radiologists.\nThese should not be seen as likely to replace human exper-\ntise, and the relationship should be mutual, ensuring better\npatient disease management. As LLMs continue to evolve,\nthey will become indispensable in radiology catering to the\nspecialty’s ever-growing demands. However, like any new\naddition, their integration will entail better background data\ntraining and feedback, as well as addressing the ethical issues\nof data privacy with the framing of regulatory guidelines and\nsecurity measures to ensure patient well-being as the pri-\nmary goal.\nReferences\n1 Kim S, Lee CK, Kim SS.
