  "abstract": "The design and implementation of static analyzers has become increasingly\\nsystematic. Yet for a given language or analysis feature, it often requires\\ntedious and error prone work to implement an analyzer and prove it sound. In\\nshort, static analysis features and their proofs of soundness do not compose\\nwell, causing a dearth of reuse in both implementation and metatheory.\\n We solve the problem of systematically constructing static analyzers by\\nintroducing Galois transformers: monad transformers that transport Galois\\nconnection properties. In concert with a monadic interpreter, we define a\\nlibrary of monad transformers that implement building blocks for classic\\nanalysis parameters like context, path, and heap (in)sensitivity. Moreover,\\nthese can be composed together independent of the language being analyzed.\\n Significantly, a Galois transformer can be proved sound once and for all,\\nmaking it a reusable analysis component. As new analysis features and\\nabstractions are developed and mixed in, soundness proofs need not be\\nreconstructed, as the composition of a monad transformer stack is sound by\\nvirtue of its constituents. Galois transformers provide a viable foundation for\\nreusable and composable metatheory for program analysis.\\n Finally, these Galois transformers shift the level of abstraction in analysis\\ndesign and implementation to a level where non-specialists have the ability to\\nsynthesize sound analyzers over a number of parameters.\\n",
