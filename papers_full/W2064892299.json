    "abstract": "This paper gives a brief overview of recent developments in cognitive science, juxtaposing two schools of thought, symbolism and connectionism. It is argued that both connectionism and symbolism are relevant for second language learning. A simple software tool for listening comprehension is then described, illustrating how some principles of connectionism as well as symbolism can be implemented in computer-assisted language learning.",
