Conventional high-\nefﬁciency DC voltage converters, especially step-up type, rely on switching operation, where\nenergy is periodically stored within and released from inductors and/or capacitors connected\nin a variety of circuit topologies. Since these energy storage components, especially induc-\ntors, are fundamentally difﬁcult to scale down, miniaturization of switching converters proves\nchallenging. Furthermore, the resulting switching currents produce signi ﬁcant electro-\nmagnetic noise. To overcome the limitations of switching converters, photonic transformers,\nwhere voltage conversion is achieved through light emission and detection processes, have\nbeen demonstrated. However, the demonstrated efﬁciency is signiﬁcantly below that of the\nswitching converter. Here we perform a detailed balance analysis and show that with a\nmonolithically integrated design that enables efﬁcient photon transport, the photonic trans-\nformer can operate with a near-unity conversion efﬁciency and high voltage conversion ratio.\nWe validate the theory with a transformer constructed with off-the-shelf discrete compo-\nnents. Our experiment showcases near noiseless operation and a voltage conversion ratio\nthat is signiﬁcantly higher than obtained in previous photonic transformers. Ourﬁndings point\nto the possibility of a high-performance optical solution to miniaturizing DC power converters\nand improving the electromagnetic compatibility and quality of electrical power.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24955-3 OPEN\n1 Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.2 Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion Israel Institute of Technology,\nHaifa, Israel. 3Present address: Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA.4These authors contributed equally: Bo\nZhao, Sid Assawaworrarit.✉email: shanhui@stanford.edu\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS|         (2021) 12:4684 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24955-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 1\n1234567890():,;\nV\noltage conversion plays a critical role in electrical and\nelectronic systems, bridging the gap between the voltage\nrequirements of the power source/generation, distribution,\nand individual loads on the circuit. As a well-known example that\nunderpins electrical power distribution networks, a voltage\ntransformer (Fig. 1a) converts one alternating current (AC) vol-\ntage to another using the principle of magnetic induction. Such a\ntransformer, however, cannot be applied directly for direct cur-\nrent (DC) voltage conversion.\nSince many electronic devices rely on DC power, direct current\n(DC) voltage converters are of essential importance in electronics.\nThe standard approach to DC voltage conversion, especially the\nstep-up type, relies on switching converters (Fig.1b). The core\nbuilding blocks of these converters are intermediate energy sto-\nrage elements (inductors and capacitors), and switches (e.g.,\ntransistors and diodes) that are temporally modulated to charge\nand discharge the energy storage elements\n1. Due to the difﬁculty\nof scaling down high-quality inductors2, switching converters\nusually take up substantial real estate on-chip3 or on the circuit\nboard4 and therefore represent a major obstacle in miniaturizing\nelectronic devices5. Moreover, the switching action inevitably\nproduces ﬂuctuating internal voltages and currents, resulting in\nsigniﬁcant electromagnetic6,7 or even acoustic noise8.\nRecently, photon-mediated voltage-conversion techniques have\nbeen proposed as an alternative solution for DC voltage\nconversion9,10 to overcome some of the limitations of standard\nswitching converters. Similar to a magnetic transformer, this\ntechnique naturally provides electric isolation between the input\nand output ports. Therefore, in this paper, we refer to such a\nphoton-based voltage converter as a photonic transformer. While\nthe electromagnetic ﬁeld of the photons are time-varying, the\nfrequencies of such variations are several orders of magnitude\nlarger than what one can detect using electronic circuits. As a\nresult, a photonic transformer operates as a DC device.\nIn a photonic transformer, a laser or a light-emitting diode\n(LED) is used to convert electrical energy to light energy, and\neither multiple photovoltaic (PV) cells laterally connected in\nseries or a tandem multijunction PV cell that are used to convert\nphoton ﬂux back to electrical energy. In doing so, an input voltage\nthat drives a laser or an LED can be boosted to a larger output\nvoltage from the PV cells. Photonic transformers have been\nshown to produce no switching noise and are immune to the\nenvironment EMI and have been utilized to build DC voltage\nconverters\n10 and gate drivers11. The fact that the limiting efﬁ-\nciency of PV cells for converting near monochromatic light to\nelectricity can approach unity12, as well as the high theoretical\nefﬁciency of LEDs, make this technology attractive. However, the\nexperimentally demonstrated ef ﬁciency, as well as voltage-\nconversion ratio, are still signiﬁcantly below that of the stan-\ndard switching voltage converter10. Therefore, it is important to\nestablish a fundamental understanding of the performance\npotential of photonic transformers, and the practical pathways to\nreach such potential.\nIn this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the funda-\nmental performance potential for photonic transformers. Here,\nwe focus on a photonic transformer that utilizes LEDs. From a\nfundamental thermodynamic point of view, the ultimate efﬁ-\nciency of an LED is higher than that of a laser. The electro-\nluminescent efﬁciency of an LED, theoretically, can in fact exceed\n100%13,14, since an LED can operate as a heat engine that gen-\nerates part of its light from the thermal energy of its\nenvironment15–18. In contrast, the efﬁciency of a laser has to be\nbelow 100%19 since part of the electric pump power has to be\nconverted to heat. In addition, the speciﬁc arrangement of the PV\ncells does not affect the performance of the photonic transformer\nin the ideal case. Therefore, our analysis focuses on using LED(s)\nfacing laterally connected PV cells in series. Using a detailed\nbalance analysis, we show that the ef ﬁciency of a photonic\ntransformer can approach unity. The key to such high efﬁciency\nis to achieve highly efﬁcient optical coupling between the LED\nand the PV cells. We thus propose a monolithic design where\nsuch a strong optical coupling between the LED and the PV cell\ncan be achieved. To validate our theoretical model, we construct a\nphotonic transformer prototype using discrete off-the-shelf\ncomponents. Measurement results from the prototype are\nindeed in good agreement with the theoretical model once non-\nidealities in the circuit prototype are accounted for. Moreover,\nalthough the experimental setup as expected does not deliver high\nefﬁciency, it achieves a large voltage-conversion ratio (>40) that\nsigniﬁcantly exceeds what have been previously demonstrated in\nexisting experiments on photonic transformers (<10)10,11.\nResults\nPerformance of ideal photonic transformers .

For planar LED and PV cells,\nwhen N is large, we can reasonably assume the view factors from\nthe LED to each PV cell,f LED!PV, are the same. In this case, each\nPV cell receives the same amount of illumination from the LED,\nand therefore generates the same voltage. We denote the voltage\n(current) of the LED and each PV cell asVLED (ILED) and VPV\n(IPV), respectively. Therefore, the input and output voltages are,\nrespectively, VIN ¼ VLED and VOUT ¼ NVPV, when the series\nresistance is negligible. The input and output currents are,\nrespectively, IIN ¼ ILED and IOUT ¼/C0 IPV . The voltage-\nconversion ratio (W) can be expressed as\nW ¼ VOUT\nVIN\n¼ N VPV\nVLED\nð1Þ\nAnd the power efﬁciency (η) can be obtained as\nη ¼ POUT\nPIN\n¼ VOUTIOUT\nVINIIN\n¼ N /C0 IPVVPV\nILEDVLED\nð2Þ\nEquation (1) indicates that the conversion ratio depends on\nhow much voltage each PV cell can recover from the photonﬂux\nemitted by the LED. The power efﬁciency is a product of the\nvoltage-conversion ratio and the current conversion ratio (−IPV/\nILED). The voltage and current of the LED and each PV cell can be\nobtained from the detailed balance relations20,21:\n½Famb!LED /C0 FLED!amb/C138þN½FPV!LED /C0 FLED!PV/C138/C0 RLEDðVLEDÞþ ILED\nq ¼ 0\nð3Þ\nand\n½Famb!PV /C0 FPV!amb/C138þ½FLED!PV /C0 FPV!LED/C138/C0 RPVðVPVÞþ IPV\nq ¼ 0\nð4Þ\nwhere Fa!b with a, b = LED, PV, and amb (the ambient), is the\nphoton ﬂux emitted from objecta and absorbed by objectb, q is\nthe elementary charge, R is the total rate of nonradiative\nrecombination. We use a sign convention such that a positive\ncurrent ﬂows from the p to the n region internally in each diode.\nTherefore, for the normal operation of the photonic transformer,\nILED ≥ 0 and IPV ≤ 0. The ambient term includes all objects\nbeyond the active regions of the LED and the PV, so the photon\nﬂux absorbed by the ambient represents the photon leakage from\nthe converter, which should be minimized. The photon ﬂux\nemitted by the ambient is much smaller compared to the photon\nﬂux emitted by the LED, and therefore can be neglected.\nFor the setup in the above panel of Fig.1c, weﬁrst consider an\nideal scenario where the LED and PV cells have the same\nbandgap with unity external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) above the\nbandgap, which implies that the nonradiative terms in Eqs. (3)\nand (4) are zero. In this case, we can model the emitted photon\nﬂux from objecta and absorbed by objectb as\nFa!bðVaÞ¼ Aaf a!b\nZ 1\nωg\nω2\n4π2c2\n1\nexpð_ω/C0 qVa\nkT Þ/C0 1\ndω ð5Þ\nIn Eq. (5), a and b denote the LED, PV, ω is the angular\nfrequency, ωg is the bandgap frequency,c is the speed of light in\nvacuum, k is the Boltzmann constant,Va is the voltage applied on\nobject a, and qVa thus corresponds to the chemical potential of\nemitted photon 22. T is the temperature of the diode, and\nthroughout the paper in the numerical calculations, we assume all\nobjects are at room temperature with T ¼ 300 K. Aa is the\nemitting surface area. f a!b is the view factor from objecta to\nobject b. If we further assume no photon leakage, then the terms\nin Eqs. (3) and (4) involving the ambient become zero, and we\nhave ALED ¼ NAPV, f LED!PV ¼ 1\nN, and f PV!LED ¼ 1. One\ntherefore could obtain/C0 NIPV ¼ ILED based on these equations.\nTherefore, W ¼ Nη based on Eqs. (1) and (2), and the maximum\nefﬁciency point is whenFLED!PV ¼ FPV!LED based on Eqs. (3)\nand (4), i.e., VPV = VLED based on Eq. (5). In other words, each\nPV cell at open-circuit condition will fully recover the voltage of\nthe LED. In this case, the series-connected PV cell array is in\nopen-circuit condition (i.e., POUT = 0) and outputs a boosted\nvoltage that is N times the input voltage according to Eq. (1).\nTherefore, the conversion ratio of the proposed photonic\ntransformer depends on the number of PV cells. This dependence\nallows one to get in principle any desired high conversion ratio by\nselecting N.\nThe operation principle of photonic transformers is funda-\nmentally different from that of conventional transformers or\nswitching converters. The emission process in the LED and\nabsorption process in the PV cell side are quantum processes\n23.\nIn contrast, in the traditional transformers (Fig.1a) or switching\nconverters (Fig.1b), the power exchange process can be described\nentirely classically.\nPerformance of photonic transformers with nonidealities. Now\nwe analyze the expected performance of an actual photonic\ntransformer. Based on the ﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem (see\n“Methods”), taking into account the less-than-unity emissivity\nfrom the LED and absorptivity of the PV cell, the photonﬂuxes\nbecome\nFLED!PVðVLEDÞ¼ ALEDf LED!PV\n8π3\nZ 1\nωg\ndω\nZZ\nξðω; kx; kyÞ Θðω; VLEDÞ\n_ω dkxdky\nð6Þ\nand\nFPV!LEDðVPVÞ¼ APVf PV!LED\n8π3\nZ 1\nωg\ndω\nZZ\nξðω; kx; kyÞ Θðω; VPVÞ\n_ω dkxdky\nð7Þ\nIn the above two equations, kx and ky are the in-plane\nwavevectors, Θ is the photon energy in a mode atω\nΘðω; T; VÞ¼ _ω\nexpð_ω/C0 qV\nkT Þ/C0 1 ð8Þ\nwhere V is the bias on the active region and qV acts as the\nchemical potential of photons18,22, A is the area, f is the view\nfactor, and ξðω; kx; kyÞ is the energy transmission coef ﬁcient\nsumming over two polarizations and has a maximum value of 2.\nThe various nonideality of the LEDs and the PV cells reduces the\nenergy transmission coefﬁcient to be <2. Moreover, with aﬁnite\nload resistance, the operation point of the PV cells is shifted away\nfrom the open-circuit condition in order to have nonzero output\npower. Hence, the voltage recovery in general will not be\ncomplete. The voltage recovery will also be subject to penalties\nfrom the nonradiative processes and series resistances in both the\nLED and PV cells. Here, we show that a practical photonic\ntransformer can still have excellent performance even under these\nconsiderations. As an example, we choose GaN (bandgap energy\n_ωg ¼ 3:45 eV) as the active region material for both the LED\nand the PV cell since a high-performance GaN-based LED with\n95% internal quantum ef ﬁciency has been experimentally\ndemonstrated24.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24955-3 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS|         (2021) 12:4684 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24955-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3\nWe ﬁrst consider the effect of nonradiative processes. The\nnonradiative recombination rates of the LED and PV cells are\nRa ¼ AaðCn;ana þ Cp;apaÞðnapa /C0 n2\ni;aÞta þ 1\nτa\nnapa /C0 n2\ni;a\nna þ pa þ 2ni;a\nAata\nð9Þ\nIn the above equation,a = PV cell or LED. Theﬁrst and the\nsecond terms on the right-hand side are the Auger and\nShockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination rates, respectively. τ\nis the bulk SRH lifetime, and Cp and Cn are the Auger\nrecombination coefﬁcients for holes and electrons, respectively.\nIn the computation, we use the optical properties of GaN and\nAlGaN from ref.25 and take into account the bias effect on the\nimaginary part of the dielectric function using the formula\ndiscussed in ref. 26. We model nonradiative terms for both the\nLED and the PV cell using typical values Cn ¼ Cp ¼\n5 ´ 10/C0 32 cm6=s and τ ¼ 20 μs27. Using Eqs. (6), (7), and (9),\ntogether with Eqs. (3) and (4), we obtain a model of theI–V curve\nfor both the LED and the PV cell. TheI–V curves for the LED\nand the PV cell are coupled by the photonic ﬂux. In the\ncomputation process, we start byﬁxing VLED to a speciﬁc value\nand then solveILED and IPV at differentVPV. In this way, one can\nobtain the input power from the LED and the output power from\nthe PV cell when the load on the PV cell is changing. The\ncomputation code for the photon ﬂuxes can be accessed from\nref. 28.\nWe next consider the effect of photonic exchange between the\nLED and the PV cell. For our device, it is critical to achieving\nefﬁcient optical coupling between the active regions of the LED\nand the PV cell. This is similar to a conventional transformer in\nwhich one uses a ferromagnetic core to reduce leakage of\nmagnetic energy. Equations (6) and (7) contain integration over\nkx and ky. In principle, there is no upper limit forkx and ky in\nsuch integral. In the case shown as blue curves in Fig.2a, the LED\nand the PV cell are separated by an air spacer layer in the far-ﬁeld\nregime with a thickness that is much larger than the emission\nwavelength (365 nm). In this case, only the propagating-wave\nchannels in air with an in-plane wavevectorβ ¼\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ ﬃ\nk2\nx þ k2\ny\nq\n<ω=c\nare utilized for light extraction29 from the front-emitting surface.\nEnhancement of coupling can be achieved if one can also utilize\nchannels with β>ω=c. A standard approach is to operate in the\nnear-ﬁeld regime where one reduces the thickness of the air\nspacer layer to be much smaller than the emission wavelength, so\nthat channels withβ>ω=c, which are evanescent in air30,31, can\ncontribute. Maintaining such small thickness in the separation\nlayer over a large area, however, represents a signi ﬁcant\nexperimental challenge32–38. Instead, here we propose to use an\nAl.5Ga.5N layer as the spacer layer between the LED and the PV\ncell. Al .5Ga.5N is essentially transparent in the emission\nwavelength range of GaN and has a refractive index nAlGaN\nsimilar to that of GaN. In doing so, the channels with\nω=c<β<nAlGaNω=c are propagating in the AlGaN layer. As an\nillustration, we show the energy transmission coefﬁcients for the\nfar-ﬁeld case with air and the case with AlGaN spacer layer in\nFig. 3c, d, respectively. We see that in the far-ﬁeld case with air,\nonly the channels above the light line of air (green dashed line)\ncontribute to photon transport. In contrast, for the case with the\nAlGaN layer, the channels between the light lines of GaN and air\nsigniﬁcantly contribute to the transport between the LED and the\nPV cell. The additional contribution of these channels greatly\nenhances the light-extraction efﬁciency of the LED such that the\nexternal quantum efﬁciency of the LED improves to 98.7%, as\ncompared with that of 90.3% for the far-ﬁeld case with an air\nspacer (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nFig. 2 Theoretical performance of the proposed DC photonic transformer. aTheoretical performance of the proposed GaN photonic transformer with the\nnonradiative recombination included (“Methods”). The light blue lines correspond to the case of a 1-μm thick air spacer layer between the LED and the PV cell,\nwhereas the orange lines are for the case of an Al.5Ga.5N spacer layer with a thickness of 1μm. Shown in the efﬁciency plot is the maximum possible efﬁciency\nby adjusting the load.b The performance of GaN photonic transformer with the Al.5Ga.5N spacer layer with different series resistanceRs =Rs,PV =Rs,LED.W e\nassume the number of PV cellsN =100. c A conceptual monolithic device design of the proposed GaN photonic transformer with an intrinsic AlGaN spacer\nlayer that provides electrical isolation and enhanced optical coupling.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24955-3\n4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS|         (2021) 12:4684 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24955-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\nThe EQE of the PV cell is also greatly enhanced because of the\nindex-matching AlGaN layer. The improvement in external\nquantum efﬁciency of the LED and the PV cells results in\nenhanced voltage-conversion ratio and conversion efﬁciency as\nindicated by the orange curves in Fig. 2a. Importantly, the\nenhancement here is not a near-ﬁeld effect. The external quantum\nefﬁciency of the LED increases only by <1% if one reduces the\nAlGaN spacer thickness from 1μm to 10 nm. Thus, the thickness\nof the spacer can be larger than the wavelength without affecting\nthe optical coupling. This is important in practice since the spacer\nlayer also needs to provide electrical insulation between the LED\nand the PV cell.\nIn Fig.3e, we show the wall-plug efﬁciency, i.e., the ratio of the\nemitted optical power and electrical power consumed by the LED,\nfor three cases. The yellow curve corresponds to the theoretical\nupper bound in the radiative limit case where the nonradiative\nrecombination rates are zero. As mentioned before, the wall-plug\nefﬁciency of the LED in the ideal case can exceed 100%13,14. The\norange and the blue curves are for the cases with the AlGaN\nspacer and the air spacer, respectively, taking into account\nnonradiative recombination processes as discussed above. The\nwall-plug efﬁciency of the LED is greatly enhanced for the AlGaN\nspacer case, as compared with the far-ﬁeld air spacer case. For\nexample, the peak value of the wall-plug efﬁciency of the LED is\nenhanced from 90.6 to 99.3%. As a result, the overall conversion\nefﬁciency improves from 85 to ~97%. Thus the use of the AlGaN\nspacer layer allows us to approach the radiative limit in spite of\nthe presence of nonradiative recombination in this system. The\nuse of the AlGaN spacer layer can also greatly improve the power\ndensity of the photonic transformer compared to the air spacer\ncase. As shown in Fig. 3f, with the AlGaN spacer layer, the\nmaximum power density can reach 10 kW/cm2 for an input\nvoltage near 3.4 V, indicating that 1 W electrical power can be\ndelivered in a footprint ~0.01 mm2. By comparison, a high-\nefﬁciency switching converter may have a volumetric power\ndensity39 of 1 W per 10–100 mm3. The use of a photonic\ntransformer can therefore signiﬁcantly reduce the device footprint\nrequired for voltage conversion.\nFig. 3 The impact of the AlGaN layer on optical coupling. aThe setup for the far-ﬁeld case with an air spacer layer having a thickness ofd =1 μm. b The\nsetup for the AlGaN spacer layer case where the LED and the PV cell are coupled through a thin Al.5Ga.5N layer with a thickness ofd = 1 μm.

We evaluate the case with the AlGaN spacer layer as\nconsidered above which yields superior performance. In the\npresence of series resistances ( Rs,LED and Rs,PV) and shunt\nresistance (Rsh,LED and Rsh,PV), the input and output voltage can\nbe related based on the circuit diagram in Fig.1ca s\nVIN ¼ VLED þð ILED þ VLED\nRsh;LED=ALED\nÞ Rs;LED\nALED\nð10Þ\nand\nVOUT ¼ N½VPV þð IPV þ VPV\nRsh;PV=APV\nÞ Rs;PV\nAPV\n/C138 ð11Þ\nIn general, the shunt resistance can be engineered to the extent\nthat the resulting penalty on the efﬁciency is negligible. Therefore,\nin the following, we focus on evaluating the impact of series\nresistance and assume the shunt resistances are inﬁnitely large for\nboth LED and the PV cell. For GaN LEDs, a series resistance as\nsmall as 1 mΩ /C1cm2 has been demonstrated experimentally24, and\nGaN tunnel junctions with series resistance as low as 0:01 mΩ /C1\ncm2 have been demonstrated as well40. In Fig.2b, we show the\nmodeled photonic transformer performance for series resistances\nof 1, 0.1, and 0 :01 mΩ /C1cm2. In general, the performance\ndegrades as the series resistance goes up. For high-input voltages\nabove 3.2 V, the series resistance penalty becomes the dominant\nlimitation on the voltage-conversion ratio and further increasing\nthe input voltage leads to diminished performance. However, the\nvoltage-conversion ratio at the maximum efﬁciency point can still\nreach over 90 (for N = 100) for all three cases, and the peak\nefﬁciency can exceed 90% whenRs ¼ 0:01 mΩ /C1cm2, indicating\nthat the excellent performance persists even in the presence of\nrealistic series resistance. We note that, in theory, conventional\nswitching converters can also have a theoretically arbitrary\nvoltage-conversion ratio by controlling the duty cycle. However,\nparasitic losses in the circuit\n1 typically place a severe limit on the\nuseful range of conversion ratios to the order of ten41,42.I n\ncontrast, the conversion ratio of our photonic transformer should\nnot be subject to such a limit. The high conversion ratio and\nefﬁciency indicate the great potential for photonic transformers to\noutperform conventional switching converters42.\nBased on the above analysis, we propose a conceptual\nmonolithic solid-state device design illustrated in Fig. 2c.\nSeparating the GaN LED layers and PV cell layers is the index-\nmatching AlGaN layer that provides both the necessary optical\ncoupling and electrical insulation. Since the LEDs and PV cells\ncan be readily miniaturized and monolithically integrated on a\nsingle die, the photonic transformer can be made with a far\nFig. 4 Proof-of-concept demonstration and veriﬁcation of the device model of the DC-to-DC photonic transformer. aSchematic of a board design with\nthe same number of LEDs (bottom half) and PV cells (top half).b Photos of the two printed circuit boards consisting of LEDs and PV cells (left) and the\nassembled photonic transformer (right).c Measured (cyan triangles) voltage ratio and conversion efﬁciency.

In obtaining the curves in blue, we\nreduce the series resistance of the PV cells from 2.18 to 0.32Ω cm2. In obtaining the orange curves, we further reduce the nonradiative recombination\nterms for both the LED and the PV cell. For the purple curves, in addition to all the previous improvements, we set the light-extraction efﬁciency to be 80%\nand the view factor between the LED and the PV cell to be 1. The used parameters are listed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24955-3\n6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS|         (2021) 12:4684 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24955-3 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\nsmaller footprint and lower weight than those of existing\nswitching DC converters. The design concept shown in Fig.2c\nuses one LED. Alternatively, one can use multiple LEDs\nconnected in parallel, which have the same theoretical perfor-\nmance, provided that the total emitting areas of the LEDs are the\nsame. In practice, using multiple LEDs may facilitate the design of\nbetter optical coupling, and allow better control over the voltage-\nconversion ratio.\nIn addition to its high performance in terms of conversion\nratio and efﬁciency, the use of a steady photonﬂux enables the\nphotonic transformer to produce an ultralow ripple output\nvoltage. The contributions from the photonic transformer to the\noutput voltage ﬂuctuations are primarily the photon shot noise\nand the thermal noise from the series resistance, both of which\nare fundamental in nature. These noises have broad frequency\nspectra. But even when integrated over the entire frequency\nbandwidth, the power in such noises is still small in comparison\nwith typical thermal noise power associated with a typical load\nresistance ( “Methods”). This contrasts with the switching\nconverters where the output voltage ripple, as well as the\naccompanying EMI, are an unavoidable result of switching.\nProof-of-concept demonstration of photonic transformer.T o\nvalidate the above theoretical model of the photonic transformer,\nwe construct a circuit prototype and test its performance using\ncommercially available off-the-shelf LEDs and PV cells. We use\nmultiple LEDs connected in parallel, as shown in the printed\ncircuit board (PCB) design in Fig. 4a. Here, we use the same\nnumber (N) of the LEDs and the PV cells. We chooseN = 100 to\nshow the high conversion ratio that the photonic approach\nenables. We use GaAs LEDs and Si PV cells to ensure reasonable\nspectral overlap between the LED and PV cell. We note that these\nchoices are only for demonstration purposes and are far from the\noptimized devices discussed above. Figure4b shows the LED and\nPV cell circuits and the assembled prototype consisting of the\nLED board facing the corresponding PV cell board (see“Meth-\nods” for the circuit construction).\nTo characterize the photonic transformer prototype, we\nconnect the LED board to a DC power supply and measure the\ncurrent–voltage (I–V) curve of the PV cell at different input\nvoltage levels. We obtain the maximum ef ﬁciency of the\ntransformer by locating the maximum power point of the PV\ncell array on the measuredI–V curve. In Fig. 4c, we show the\nvoltage ratio at the maximum ef ﬁciency point and the\ncorresponding efﬁciency of the transformer for different input\nvoltages. The ef ﬁciency peaks at the input voltage of\nV\nIN ¼ 1:39 V. Further increasing the input voltage leads to a\ndecrease in efﬁciency due to the series resistance of the LEDs and\nthe PV cells, as discussed earlier in the theoretical calculation\nshown in Fig. 2c. At the peak efﬁciency (5.77%), we obtain a\nvoltage-conversion ratio 31.2, a clear demonstration of the DC\nvoltage-conversion functionality of our photonic transformer.\nThe ratio between the open-circuit voltage and the input voltage\nis 40.9. Therefore, one could tune the operation point to obtain an\neven higher voltage-conversion ratio. We analyze the crude\nprototype photonic transformer circuit using the proposed model.\nThe predictions are shown in Fig.4c as continuous curves, which\nagree well with the experimentally measured values. This\nagreement provides validation of our theoretical model. As an\ninteresting side note, our demonstrated voltage-conversion ratio\n(>40) exceeds what has been previously demonstrated in existing\nexperiments on photonic transformers (<10)10,11.\nFrom the device model for the prototype, we identify several\naspects that could be improved for better performance. These\naspects include the series resistance of the PV, the external\nquantum efﬁciency for both the LED and the PV, and the optical\ncoupling between the LED and the PV cell. The series resistance\nin our device (Rs,PV = 2.33 Ω cm2) can be improved signiﬁcantly\nto as small as 0.32Ω cm2 by optimizing the PV cell design23. This\nimprovement especially helps to minimize the loss at high-power\nlevels as shown by the blue curve in Fig.4d. Also, one can use\nhigher-quality semiconductor materials to improve the radiative\nefﬁciency of the LED and the PV. For the LED, both the Auger\nprocess and the SRH process are important nonradiative\nnonidealities since the LED is operating near its peak of quantum\nefﬁciency. For the PV cell, the SRH process is the major\nnonradiative recombination process because its bias at relevant\noperating conditions is far below its bandgap. With the relevant\nparameters replaced by the improved numbers reported in the\nliterature43,44,e fﬁciency and the voltage-conversion ratio can be\nboth signiﬁcantly improved for all input power levels, as shown\nby the yellow curves in Fig.4d. In addition, the optical coupling\nbetween the LED and the PV cell can be improved. This includes\nimproved light extraction to air for the LED, which reduces the\ninternal photon loss inside the devices and increasing the view\nfactor between the LED and PV cell to suppress photon leakage to\nthe environment. With all these improvements implemented, the\nperformance can be raised to that indicated by the purple curves\nin Fig.4d where the efﬁciency is signiﬁcantly enhanced to ~40%.\nThese calculations indicate the pathways to improve the\nperformance of demonstrated photonic transformer here using\nexisting components, and further justify the necessity of the\nproposed monolithic design in enhancing the optical coupling\nand improving light-extraction efﬁciency to achieve the ultimate\nperformance of the photonic transformer.\nAs ﬁnal remarks, we measure and validate that the additive\nnoise output voltage noise and EMI of our prototype photonic\ntransformer are below our measurement capability while that of a\ncomparable switching converter is clearly observed (Supplemen-\ntary Fig. 2). We note that the monolithic photonic transformer\ncan also operate as a step-down DC transformer if the LEDs are\nin series and PV cells are in parallel. The monolithic photonic\ntransformer is highly scalable and can be easily integrated on-\nchip\n45. The conversion ratio and/or the output voltage can be\nmodiﬁed in real time by a switch network that reconﬁgures the\nconnections among the LEDs and another switch network on the\nPV side such that the output voltage and current can be adjusted\nin discrete steps. Other high-quality semiconductors14 may be\nused, depending on the application and input voltage range. Our\nphotonic transformer also inherently provides electrical isolation\nbetween the input and output, protecting the load from\ndestructive or hazardous electric shocks. While the initial\napplication of the photonic transformer concept is likely in low\npower electronic circuits (Ws to kWs level), one may envision\nthat this concept can be scaled up to a power level relevant for\nelectric power network (MWs level). Our photonic transformer\ncan also be combined with conventional switching converters, to\nsupport voltage regulation, while still providing the beneﬁts of\nhigh efﬁciency, low footprint and weight, and low noise. The\nproposed photonic transformer highlights the signiﬁcant poten-\ntial for using photons as the intermediate energy carrier in power\nconversion applications.\nMethods\nFluctuation–dissipation theorem. In the theoretical description of the GaN\nphotonic transformer, we use theﬂuctuation–dissipation theorem to model the\nradiative recombination rate since this approach is applicable for both the near-\nand far-ﬁeld scenarios, and one can describe the photon transport process without\nexplicitly deﬁning the radiative recombination coefﬁcient, escape probability, and\nlight-extraction efﬁciency. Here, we consider the case where the surfaces of the\nLED and theN PV cells are parallel, and the schematic shows a unit cell of the\nwhole structure as Fig.3a, b.

In\ncontrast, in the case with an AlGaN spacer layer, there are signiﬁcant contributions\nfrom regions withβ2>ω2=c2. In Supplementary Fig. 1, we show the external\nquantum efﬁciency (EQE) of the GaN LED in both the far-ﬁeld case with air, and\nthe case with AlGaN spacer layer. In the far-ﬁeld case with air, the GaN LED has an\nequivalent radiative recombination coefﬁcient about B ¼ 9 ´ 10/C0 12 cm3=s, similar\nto the reported typical value27. In the case with AlGaN spacer layer, the light-\nextraction efﬁciency is greatly enhanced, resulting in an enhanced EQE for the LED\nas theﬁgure shows. We note that, by enhancing the light-extraction efﬁciency with\nthe use of the AlGaN spacer layer, one also increases the radiative recombination\ncoefﬁcient, since photons previously trapped and reabsorbed by the LED\n(contributing to a reverse current) can now be extracted. Therefore, the use of the\nAlGaN spacer layer also greatly improves the current density and the power density\nof the photonic transformer.\nPhotonic transformer withN LEDs andN PV cells. We perform an analysis on\nthe ideal performance of the setup with identicalN LEDs andN PVs. For the circuit\nshown in Fig.4a, the LEDs have the same current and the PV cells have the same\nvoltage. We denote the voltage (current) of each LED and PV cell asV\nLED (ILED)\nand VPV (IPV), respectively. Due to the symmetry of the system, the input and\noutput voltages are respectivelyVIN ¼ VLED and VOUT ¼ NVPV, when series\nresistance is neglected. The input and output currents are, respectively,IIN ¼\nNILED and IOUT ¼/C0 IPV. Compared to the one LED andN PV cells case discussed\nin the main text, the only difference is in the formula forIIN. In the ideal case, the\ntotal current inN LEDs in parallel is equal to the current in one LED, provided that\nthe total emitting area of theN LEDs is the same as the emitting area of the one\nLED. Therefore,IIN is equivalent for theN LEDs case and one LED case. Thus, the\nphotonic transformer will have the same theoretical performance for the two cases.\nPractically, using multiple LEDs may assist the optical coupling between the LEDs\nand PV cells, and help eliminate the series resistance caused by current spreading\nin large active area LEDs.\nConstruction of the photonic transformer prototype. We design two circuit\nboards and have them fabricated by PCBWay— one to populate 100 LEDs (Osram\nSFH4253-Z GaAs LEDs) and the other to house 100 PV cells (Osram BPW 34S-Z\nSi PIN photodiodes). The LEDs/PV cells are arranged in a 10 × 10 grid with 1 cm\npitch in either direction on the corresponding board and routed to realize a parallel\n(series) connection on the LED (PV) board. Power connections for both boards are\nmade on the reverse side of the boards. The two boards are mounted with LEDs\nand PV cells facing each other using alignment holes placed at each board corner\nthrough which a series of bolts, spacing washers, and nuts are used to maintain\nLED-to-PV alignment and ensure good optical coupling. In characterizing the\nphotonic transformer prototype, we connect the LED board to a DC power supply\n(Keysight E36312A) and measure theI–V curve of the PV cell board using a source\nmeter (Keithley 2636B) at different input voltage levels.\nMeasurement of view factor and LED EQE. The PV cell in general has a less than\n100% probability of converting an incident photon into photocurrent. We denote\nthe external quantum efﬁciency of the PV cell asη\nRES to account for the nonideal\nresponse of the PV cell. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows the external quantum efﬁ-\nciency of the Si PV cell and the electroluminescent emission spectrum of the GaAs\nLED. The external quantum efﬁciency of the PV cell is deﬁned as the ratio between\nthe output electron numberﬂux and the input photon numberﬂux at the short-\ncircuit condition. The response of the PV cell is characterized by the spectrum-\naveraged external quantum efﬁciency from 725 to 925 nmηRES ¼ 0:897. The\naverage photon energy of the LED emission spectrum is 1.46 eV (847 nm). Based\non its datasheet, the emitted optical power from the LED is 40 mW atIIN = 70 mA.\nWith the averaged emitted photon energy, we compute the external quantum\nefﬁciency of the LED at this input power level andﬁnd EQE = 39.1%.\nTo measure the photon transfer efﬁciency from the LED to the PV cell, we build\na separate device that has only one LED and one PV cell. We then measure the\nratio of the input current of a LED and the short-circuit current of the PV cell as\nshown in Supplementary Fig. 4, from which\nIOUT\nIIN\n¼ EQE ´ f LED!PV ´ ηRES ð16Þ\nAt Iin = 70 mA, we measure a current ratio of 0.254. Together with the averaged\nexternal quantum efﬁciency of the PV cell, we obtainf LED!PV ¼ 0:73. In the\ndevice model, we assume this view factor is the same for every LED and PV cell\npair in the transformer prototype. We then measure theI–V curves of the LED\narray as shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a. For each input level, we measure theI–V\ncurve of the PV cell array as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. Based on Eq. (16), we\nobtain the EQE of the LED array at different input levels as shown in\nSupplementary Fig. 5b from the ratio of output short-circuit current and the input\ncurrent. We show the voltage and the current at the peak efﬁciencies in\nSupplementary Fig. 7.\nDevice model for the photonic transformer prototype. Since our prototype is a\nfar-ﬁeld device, we can simplify the model and highlight the important non-\nidealities. Instead of Eq. (6), we compute the photonﬂux produced by the LED as\nF0 ¼ ALEDBLEDnLEDpLEDtLED ð17Þ\nIn the above equation,t is the thickness of the active region of the diode,A is\nthe area of the active region,n and p are the electron and hole concentrations,\nrespectively, andB is the radiative recombination coefﬁcient. Due to the refractive\nindex contrast between the LED and air, many of the generated photons will be\ntrapped in the LED and eventually absorbed parasitically by the LED such as in the\ncontacts. Therefore, we introduce a light-extraction efﬁciency (η\nEXT) which\ndescribes the proportion of photons that can escape from the LED into free space.\nThe imperfect transmission of light from the LED to the active region of the PV cell\nis captured by the geometric view factorf\nLED!PV. We lump the internal photon\nloss in the LED and the PV cell detection photon loss all in the ambient terms in\nEqs. (3) and (4). With these parameters, the photonﬂux terms in Eqs. (3) and (4)\ncan be modeled as\nFLED!PV ¼ f LED!PVηEXTηRESF0 ð18Þ\nand\nFLED!amb ¼ð 1 /C0 f LED!PVÞηEXTF0 þð 1 /C0 ηEXTÞF0 þ f LED!PVηEXTð1 /C0 ηRESÞF0\nð19Þ\nIn Eq. (19), the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the photon loss directly to\nthe ambient, the second term is the internal photon loss in the LED, and the third\nterm is the photon loss in the incident photonﬂux that is received but not absorbed\nby the active region of the PV. Since the photonﬂuxes emitted by the Si PV cell and\nthe ambient in general are much smaller compared to that from the emission from\nthe GaAs LED with a bias, we neglect the other photonﬂux terms in Eqs. (3) and\n(4). The nonradiative terms are the same as Eq. (9). Substituting Eqs. (18), (19),\nand (9) into Eqs. (3) and (4), we obtain a model for theI–V curves of the LED and\nPV cell boards. Besides the parameters that are measured (i.e., view factors and\nLED EQE), we obtain the remaining parameters used in the model byﬁtting the\nmeasured I–V curve of the LED and the set ofI–V curves of the PV cell iteratively\nusing thefmincon function provided by MATLAB. We list the obtained parameters\nin the tables in the Supplementary section.\nSetup for measuring output voltageﬂuctuations and electromagneticﬁeld\nemissions. We measure and compare the electromagnetic noise generated by the\nconventional switching converter and the photonic transformer using the setup\nshown in Supplementary Fig. 2a. The setup consists of an oscilloscope to monitor\nthe output voltageﬂuctuations and aﬁeld probe connected to a spectrum analyzer\nto monitor the emitted electromagneticﬁelds. For commercial switching converter\ndesign, we use Microchip MCP1640EV (Supplementary Fig. 2b), which is an\nevaluation board containing the manufacturer’s suggested design and board layout\nto implement a step-up DC-to-DC converter. Each circuit undergoes the following\nmeasurement procedures: (i) an appropriate load resistance to produce ~50 mW\noutput power is selected and mounted on the circuit output; (ii) input DC voltage\nsupply (Keysight E36312A adjustable DC power supply) is applied; (iii) output\nvoltage level is measured (B&K 2709B multimeter) and output voltage waveform is\ntaken (Lecroy WaveAce 1012 oscilloscope); and (iv)ﬁeld emission spectrum is\ntaken using magneticﬁeld probe (Beehive Electronics BH100C) connected to a\nspectrum analyzer (Tek 495 P). In theﬁnal step, we maintain a 2-cm parallel gap\nbetween theﬁeld probe and the circuit board; the location of the probe where the\nspectrum is taken is the one at which the maximumﬁeld is registered on the\nspectrum analyzer as measured by the magnitude of the lowest frequency peak, if\navailable. An extra spectrum is taken with power to the circuit under test turned off\nto provide the measurement of the background/instrument noiseﬂ\noor. Measure-\nment parameters for the switching converter and photonic transformer circuit are,\nrespectively, as follows.

We begin by describing\nnoise processes in a photonic transformer consisting of only one LED and one PV\ncell (Supplementary Fig. 8a) and subsequently consider the entire system, including\nmultiple PV cells and the load. The photon statistics of an LED connected to a\nvoltage source is well-characterized by photon shot noise46,47. The noise in the PV\ncell at low injection levels can be considered as a result of independent noise\nﬂuctuations, each modeled as a Poissonian noise process, as shown in Supple-\nmentary Fig. 8b whereIphoto is the photocurrent,I ¼ I0e\nqV\nηkT is the junction’s for-\nward current, andI0 is the saturation current46,48.

We evaluate these noise contributions for the photonic\ntransformer circuit under the measurement conditions of Supplementary Fig. 2\nwith relevant circuit parameters as follow:N = 100, I\nphoto = 9 mA,Rj = 6 Ω, τ =\n0.551 μs, Rs = 31 Ω, Rsh = 21 kΩ, andRL = 68 kΩ.

These noise con-\ntributions from the photonic transformer are miniscule in comparison with a noise\nlevel from an ideal resistive load ofRL which produces noise power 4kTRL = 1100\nnV2/Hz at room temperature— this statement applies in general forRL /C29 NRs\nwhich corresponds to near-constant output voltage operation. Finally, we note that\nlow-frequency noise (often referred to as“1/f” or ﬂicker noise), which typically\nshows up in electronics and manifests asﬂuctuations over a long time scale, may\ncontribute to higher noise at low frequency. Such noise has been found to correlate\nwith defects in semiconductor lattice and contacts, and can be reduced with higher\nquality device preparation\n51,52.\nData availability\nThe measured I–V data of the photonic transformer prototype generated in this study\nhave been deposited in the Figshare repository [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.\nﬁgshare.14729235].\nCode availability\nThe code used in this work is available athttps://github.com/fancompute/MESH.\nReceived: 15 November 2020; Accepted: 12 July 2021;\nReferences\n1.
