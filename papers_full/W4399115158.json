  "abstract": "The recent leaps in complexity and fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nmean that, for the first time in human history, people can interact with\\ncomputers using natural language alone. This creates monumental possibilities\\nof automation and accessibility of computing, but also raises severe security\\nand safety threats: When everyone can interact with LLMs, everyone can\\npotentially break into the systems running LLMs. All it takes is creative use\\nof language. This paper presents Hacc-Man, a game which challenges its players\\nto \"jailbreak\" an LLM: subvert the LLM to output something that it is not\\nintended to. Jailbreaking is at the intersection between creative problem\\nsolving and LLM security. The purpose of the game is threefold: 1. To heighten\\nawareness of the risks of deploying fragile LLMs in everyday systems, 2. To\\nheighten people's self-efficacy in interacting with LLMs, and 3. To discover\\nthe creative problem solving strategies, people deploy in this novel context.\\n",
