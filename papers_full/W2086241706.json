  "abstract": "Analysis of harmonic losses in transformers which has practical significance is treated as an important aspect in safe, economic operation and energy-saving for devices and the whole system. In the article, harmonic equivalent parameter model has been used, then the frequency-dependent characteristics of harmonic winding model is researched further by the electromagnetic point of view, and harmonic loss is amended with the winding resistance frequency matter and the equivalent non-linear superposition taken into account. In order to take out the advantages, several algorithms have been put forward as traditional curve fitting, IEEE Standard. A variable speed system referred to the actual heat pump model is built up finally, and the Effectiveness, feasibility and accuracy of the method mentioned above have been proved through comparison of calculation and simulation.",
