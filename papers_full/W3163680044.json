INTRODUCTION\nPower transformers are costly and vital equipment in power\nsystem electricity grids. To ensure a power system operates\nsafely and reliably, proper condition monitoring and evalu-\nation schemes for network assets is necessary [1]. This can\nbe done through measuring speciﬁc diagnostic parameters\nfor each asset in regular basis to assess the overall health\ncondition of the asset by integrating all diagnostic parameters\ninto one index, which is often called health index. This index\ncan be used to sort the transformers according to their failure\nprobabilities.\nCIGRE (International Council on Large Electric Systems)\npublished a Technical Brochure 761 on condition assessment\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Gongbo Zhou.\nof power transformers [2]. One of the limitations of scoring\nand indexing reported in this brochure is the quality of the\nused data. Sources of data quality issues include measurement\naccuracy as well as incompleteness, and missed data. It is\nimportant that the impact of unavailable data on the overall\nhealth index to be understood as this may result in false\ndiagnoses.\nGenerally, there are two main approaches to determine\nthe health index (HI) of power transformers: the conven-\ntional HI method based on scoring and weighting, and the\nnon-conventional HI method based on artiﬁcial intelligence\nand machine learning. Scoring and weighting is still the most\nwidely used and straightforward HI approach that has been\npresented in several studies in the literature [3]–[10]. The\nconventional method of health indexing based on scoring\nand weighting relies on personnel expertise. Each HI input\nVOLUME 9, 2021 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ 74703\nR. A. Prasojoet al.: Dealing With Data Uncertainty for Transformer Insulation System Health Index\nparameter is scored and weighted to provide an overall\noutput index reﬂecting the overall health condition of the\ninvestigated transformer.\nA few studies can be found in the literature in regard to\nuncertainty in the used data. For instance, studies in [11], [12]\nproposed a Bayesian belief network HI that is able to capture\nthe uncertainties of used data by showing the percentage\nof each transformer, judged as a certain category. Study\nin [13] proposed a health estimation approach using Markov\nchains and evidential reasoning. This model was aimed to\novercome problems such as uncertainty, accuracy and con-\nﬁdence in the inspected results. Study in [14] developed a\nsoft computing and probabilistic HI and provided conﬁdence\nintervals for decision-making under data uncertainty. While\nthese approaches are interesting and going to the right direc-\ntion, the implementation is not as straightforward as scoring\nand weighting method currently used by utilities worldwide.\nTherefore, practical implementation of such techniques is not\nyet to be seen.\nOn the other hand, some previous studies presented various\nprediction approaches for unavailable transformer assess-\nment data. Study in [15] proposed an ensemble classiﬁer\nto predict oil interfacial tension (IFT). Studies in [16], [17]\nproposed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)\nmodel to predict paper condition using more widely avail-\nable oil assessment data. Study in [18] proposed a k-nearest\nneighbors predictive model to estimate furan level using\noil breakdown voltage, acidity, water content, and dissolved\ngases. Study in [19] employed an artiﬁcial neural network\nto predict several oil parameters, such as IFT, acidity, and\nbreakdown voltage. Study in [20] proposed a support vector\nmachine model to classify power transformer paper condition\nusing oil dielectric characteristics and dissolved gases. Study\nin [21] presented an exponential relationship between IFT\nand acidity of the transformer oil in which one measured\nparameter can be used to estimate the other parameter, if not\navailable.\nThis article aims to deal with data unavailability in power\ntransformer conventional HI. The proposed certainty levels\nare reported along with the HI results of the investigated\ntransformers. In addition, the impact of unavailable data on\nthe HI is evaluated, and a guideline to interpret the HI and\ncertainty level is proposed.\nII. UNCERTAINTY ON HEALTH INDEX\nHI model is a useful diagnostic tool, if developed properly.\nHowever, handling too much data required by the model is a\nchallenging task. According to [22], uncertainty of informa-\ntion in the HI model is due to three reasons as follows.\nA. DATA ACCURACY\nIssue of data accuracy can be raised due to incorrect data\nentry, or inaccurate measurements. Therefore, validation of\nthe used data is essential before using them in the HI model.\nAll entry and typo errors need to be carefully reviewed and\ncorrected. Questionable measurements need to be retested\nand remeasured whenever possible.\nThe use of several measurements that represent the same\nfailure mode may have different sensitivity. This issue can be\nresolved by using proper weighting factors i.e., more critical\nand reliable parameter gets a higher weighting.\nB. DATA COMPLETENESS\nOne of the ways for the HI model to handle missed data is\nby leaving out the unavailable parameters then recalibrating\nthe results which is the most common and straightforward\napproach. When using this approach, it is necessary to report\nthe level of uncertainty along with the HI value, which is not\ngiven much attention in the current literature.\nC. DATA TIMELINESS\nIdeally, HI calculation should be conducted right after the\nmeasurements of the used parameters. However, several\ntransformers do not have complete data at each point of\nmeasurements. This issue can be solved with the use of\nmeasurement history as will be elaborated below.\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nThis section presents the proposed methodology to handle\nuncertainty in the parameters used by the HI model.\nA. MULTI EXPERT PARAMETER PRIORITIZATION\nThe use of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to capture the\nknowledge and experience of experts in power transformer\nassessment has been reported in [23]–[25]. A multi-expert\nparameter prioritization using AHP has been developed\nin [23], [26]. In this study, ﬁve experts with vast experience in\ntransformer condition monitoring and diagnostics have taken\nparts to ﬁll in a designed questioners survey, which has been\nreported in [26]. The survey is meant to compare the param-\neters to each other through two main criteria: measurement\nreliability (MR) and criticality (CR). The MR assesses the\nreliability of the results due to each parameter, while the CR\nevaluates the criticality of each parameter toward each factor.\nEach expert was asked to ﬁll in the comparison matrix (C )\ngiven by (1) with balanced scales of pairwise comparison as\nproposed in [27].\nC =\n⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\n⏐⏐⏐\nC11 =1 C 12 =1/C21 C13 =1/C31 . . .

Prasojoet al.: Dealing With Data Uncertainty for Transformer Insulation System Health Index\nThe comparison matrix in (1) is of nxn dimension in which\neach element (C ij) represents the value of each used parame-\nter compared with each other. The main diagonal values are\nalways unity, as each of these elements is compared with\nitself. Each of the lower and higher triangle value is mutually\nreversed [23]. The calculation of the experts’ answers into\nweighting factors (w i) was carried out by AHP using (2).\nTo aggregate the results of multiple experts, consensus anal-\nysis was employed. The detailed process of weighting factor\ndetermination is explained in [23] and [26].\nThe results of these processes are the weightages of the\nHI model used in this paper as shown in Table 1. The table\ncomprises various diagnostic parameters to assess the oil\nquality, paper condition, and any possible faults. Weighting\nfactors have been given to each parameter (Wp) and each\nfactor (Wf ) based on utility personnel expertise.\nTABLE 1. Weighting values of the HI model used in this paper.\nBesides using the weighting factor for calculating the HI,\nthis paper proposes the calculation of the certainty level as\ndiscussed below.\nB. CALCULATION OF CERTAINTY LEVEL\nA parameter prioritization analysis has been conducted and\nthe results are listed in Table 1. The Wp values are used to cal-\nculate the certainty level (CL) according to data availability\nbased on the model presented in [28].\nThe more considered and complete parameters, the higher\nthe CL and the more conﬁdent decisions can be made.\nBy expressing the proposed certainty level, in addition to\nthe HI value, better asset management scheme can be devel-\noped to determine an appropriate action based on the health\ncondition of the power transformer [28].\nThe CLi for each parameter (i) in Table 1 is calculated using\nthe corresponding Wpi and Wfi. After that, the overall CL can\nbe calculated as per the below equations with results listed\nin Table 2.\nCLi =Wpi ×Wf i (3)\nCL =sum (Available CLi)\nMax CL ×100 (4)\nThe same approach can be replicated using different\nweighting factors, or even different HI structures. Whenever\nthere is unavailable information, the HI can still be calculated,\nTABLE 2. Contribution of each parameter to the overall certainty level.\nand recalibrated. However, the certainty level needs to be\nreported along with the HI result as proposed in this paper.\nC. HEALTH INDEX CALCULATION\nThe use of incomplete data for HI calculation can still be\ndone by reporting its certainty level alongside with the HI\nresult. The impact of data unavailability is evaluated in this\npaper as per the proposed methodology shown in Fig. 1 that\nis developed based on the assessment of 157 Indonesian\npower transformers of 150 kV rated voltage. The 157 power\ntransformers encompass complete data as required by the\nHI. The HI is ﬁrst calculated for each transformer with all\ncomplete data, resulting in HI0. Then, the dataset for each\ntransformer is adjusted to 50 combinations of various sce-\nnarios of unavailable data as shown in Appendix 1. For each\nset of these scenarios, the HI is calculated. Hence, for each\ntransformer, 51 HI values are obtained (HI0 for complete\ndata and HI1 to HI50 for various missed data). The impact\nof data unavailability is then investigated by comparing the\nHI1-HI50 to HI0 as the baseline.\nOne way to calculate the HI when data is incomplete is by\nignoring unavailable data then recalibrating the obtained HI.\nA simpliﬁed example of how this approach can be conducted\nis presented in [22]. For instance, four failure modes, FM 1 to\nFM4, are assessed as input parameters to the HI model. In this\nsimpliﬁed example, the aggregation of HI is a simple sum of\neach FM score, as shown in (5). Maximum score for each FM\nis 25, and hence the maximum HI is 100.\nThe incomplete data in this example is simulated with\nunavailable FM 4. With incomplete data, the HI can still be\ncalculated through a recalibration step using (6).\n• FM1 =25 out of 25\n• FM2 =20 out of 25\n• FM3 =15 out of 25\n• FM4 =Unavailable out of 25\nHImax =(25 +25 +25 +25) =100 (5)\nHIwith unavailable FM4 =(25 +20 +15) ∗100/75 =80 (6)\nThis calculation ignores the unavailable data, but retains\nthe maximum value to be 100 by recalibration.\nThis paper adopts the HI approach using the structure\nproposed in [29]. Each parameter is assigned a score Si, then\nVOLUME 9, 2021 74705\nR. A. Prasojoet al.: Dealing With Data Uncertainty for Transformer Insulation System Health Index\nFIGURE 1.

The ﬁnal HI is then calculated by aggregating\nthe SFj and Wf j values using (8). The maximum HI value\n(100) indicates very good condition, while 0 HI reveals very\npoor condition.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nFig. 2 shows the HI of the investigated 157 Power Transform-\ners with complete data (HI0). The results show that 47 trans-\nformers are in a very good condition, 22 in a good condition,\n42 are in a concerning condition and need attention while\n41 transformers are in a poor condition. Only 5 transformers\nare found in a very poor condition.\nA. IMPACT OF MISSED DATA\nHI1 to HI50 are calculated based on the assumed missed data\nscenarios and are compared with the HI0 that is calculated\nwith the availability of complete data. In this way, the impact\nof data unavailability to the HI calculation can be evaluated.\nBased on this analysis, Transformer A is in a very good\ncondition for all assumed scenarios as shown in Fig. 3. In this\ncase, data availability is not really showing observable impact\nFIGURE 2. Health Index (HI0) results of 157 power transformers using\ncomplete data.\nFIGURE 3. Discrepancy of the Health Index results from various data\navailability scenarios for transformer A.\nFIGURE 4.

This is because when the transformer is in\nsatisfactory condition, most of the parameters are in a similar\nhealthy state.\nFig. 4 shows that transformer B has a HI0 corresponds to a\nconcerning condition. The discrepancy in HI results is more\nobvious at CL of about 70% and even more visible at lower\nCL values. A similar pattern is observed for transformer C\nas shown in Fig. 5. This transformer is in poor condition\nwhen its HI is calculated with complete data (HI0). When less\ndata are used, the HI discrepancy is more visible. Moreover,\nHI calculation shows that transformer C is in good condition\nwhen the CL is around 61%. These results reveal the false\n74706 VOLUME 9, 2021\nR. A.

One way to overcome this issue is by considering\nthe CL along with the HI.\nFig. 6 shows a scatterplot of certainty level and each simi-\nlarity to HI0 for all studied HI1-HI50 scenarios. These results\nreveal the impact of unavailable data on the HI results. The\nsimilarity is decreasing when the certainty level is decreasing.\nAn exponential regression line can be obtained with a high\ncoefﬁcient correlation of R 2 = 0.848 as shown in Fig. 6.\nIn this study, a similarity percentage of 70% is considered as\nan acceptable level, then a CL of 80% or higher is necessary\nto obtain good agreement between HI0 and the HI calculated\nwith missed data. Calculating the HI with incomplete data and\nwith a CL less than 80% is considered inaccurate and calls for\nthe necessity of providing some of these missed data.\nB. DATA TIMELINESS IN HEALTH INDEX CALCULATION\nAnother problem arising on power transformer HI calculation\nis the data timeliness. Power transformers are frequently\nobserved once or twice a year, and more frequently for crit-\nical transformers. However, not all measurements are being\navailable at each inspection time [2], [22]. This can be an\nissue for utility engineers to use the data for HI calculation.\nOne of the most common ways to assess the trans-\nformer with unavailable recent data is to use historical data.\nFig. 7 and 8 show examples of the use of historical data to\nestimate the transformer current state. However, this may lead\nto another uncertainty of whether the state of the parameter is\nstill relevant to the transformer current condition or not.\nFIGURE 7. Using the previous interfacial tension measurement for\nunavailable current data.\nFIGURE 8. Using the previous colour scale observation for current\nunavailable data.\nIn this paper, all of the used historical data to assess the\ntransformer current HI were measured in the same year.\nTherefore, the uncertainty due to data timeliness is disre-\ngarded. However, for more accurate analysis about data time-\nliness, further investigation is required, which is out of the\nscope of this paper.\nC. ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED MODEL\nAfter assessing the investigated transformers HI and report-\ning the CL as suggested, analysis of the obtained results\nis conducted based on the proposed guideline as shown\nin Table 3. This guideline is explained through six case studies\nas listed in Table 4 with the corresponding HI and CL values\nfor each transformer.\nIn Table 4, transformer 1 (TRF1) shows an HI in the\ncategory of very good condition. There are missing values\nfor 2FAL and IFT. The calculated CL with such missing data\nis 83% which is moderate. According to Table 3, no action\nis necessary for this transformer. TRF 2 shows similar results\nbut has more complete measurements and higher CL.\nThe HI assessment of TRF3 shows a good condition.\nThe parameters missing are 2FAL, IFT, and oil colour.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 74707\nR. A. Prasojoet al.: Dealing With Data Uncertainty for Transformer Insulation System Health Index\nTABLE 3. Guideline for the simultaneous use of HI and CL to assess\ntransformer condition.\nTABLE 4. Case study of six 150 kV power transformers.\nThe calculated CL (78%) is lower than the acceptable thresh-\nold limit. High concentration of C 2H6 is detected, revealing\na thermal fault in the oil or paper [30]. TRF3 has been in\nservice for 14 years only. Based on Table 3, the recommended\naction for this transformer is to conduct more testing due to\nthe uncertainty of the obtained analysis.\nTRF4 results in a concerning HI condition with complete\ndiagnostic parameters. This transformer has been in operation\nfor 20 years. As the parameters are complete, the CL is\n100%. The oil quality factor classiﬁes this transformer in\npoor condition due to high acidity, low IFT, and pretty dark\noil colour [31]. The recommendation for this transformer is\nto provide urgent action such as taking the transformer out\nof service to rectify this issue before the health condition\nbecomes worse.\nTRF5 is in poor HI condition, with the oil quality factor\nin poor condition (D), while faults factor and paper condi-\ntion factor need caution (C). The available data as shown\nin Table 4 show that the acidity is very high. High acidity in\nthis transformer is an indication of oil oxidation that degrades\nthe insulation paper through hydrolysis process [32]. Due to\nseveral unavailable data such as 2FAL, IFT, and oil colour,\nthe CL is low. It is recommended that TRF5 needs urgent\ntesting to conﬁrm its current health condition.\nBased on the HI of TRF6, its condition is considered very\npoor. The faults factor of this transformer is critical, and\nthe paper condition is poor. The oil colour is moderately\ndark with high concentrations of CO and CO 2, which is an\nindication for solid insulation degradation [31], [33]. The\ndissolved gas analysis (DGA) interpretation using Duval Pen-\ntagon indicated a thermal fault in oil above 700 0C. Even\nthough the 2FAL and IFT parameters are unavailable for this\ntransformer, the CL is 83% and the recommendation is to take\nan immediate remedial action.\nResults above indicate that complete data availability\nresults in more reliable HI. In case of missing data with a CL\nof more than 80%, the HI will be close to the HI calculated\nwith complete parameters. In case of CL less than 80%,\nsome of the missed data should be measured or estimated as\nelaborated in the prediction of the IFT below.\nD. IFT PREDICTION MODEL\nIFT is a measure of the inter-surface strength between oil\nand water. IFT can be used as a detection tool for oil-soluble\nsludge. During the early stages of oil aging, IFT changes\nrapidly but this change usually stabilizes once a moderate\nlevel of damage is achieved [34]. Because IFT is often\nunavailable, a prediction approach using available measured\nparameters for most of the Indonesian transformer ﬂeets is\nuseful.\nThe proposed prediction model is developed using\n357 transformers collected data, consisting of twelve input\nfeatures: water content (Water), voltage breakdown (VBD),\ncolour scale, acidity, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide\n(CO2), hydrogen (H 2), methane (CH 4), acetylene (C 2H2),\nethylene (C 2H4), ethane (C 2H6), and CO+CO 2. These fea-\ntures are shown in Table 5, and are used to predict the out-\nput oil IFT value. The model is developed by training ﬁve\ndifferent algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM),\ndecision tree (DT), random forest (RF), linear regression\n(LR), and artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) with the collected\ndata along with the actual IFT value. A total of 18 feature\nTABLE 5. List of used features.\n74708 VOLUME 9, 2021\nR. A. Prasojoet al.: Dealing With Data Uncertainty for Transformer Insulation System Health Index\nTABLE 6. Eighteen combinations of features.\ncombinations as shown in Table 6 are evaluated, and the opti-\nmal model with the highest prediction accuracy is selected.\nIn this analysis, the used validation method is the 5-fold\ncross validation. The procedure of the 5-fold cross validation\nis conducted by dividing the dataset of N samples into ﬁve\ngroups of N/5 size each. The algorithm is trained using four\ngroups and tested using one group, then performed repeatedly\nfor ﬁve times. The mean accuracy is used as the accuracy of\nthe algorithm.\nThe performance of the proposed model is assessed using\nsymmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE) to mea-\nsure error percentage, then the percentage accuracy is calcu-\nlated. Fig. 9 shows the accuracy of various IFT prediction\nmodels based on various feature combinations in Table 6. The\nresults show that the median of the random forest model’s\naccuracy in predicting the IFT value is the highest, which is\n88.8%.\nFIGURE 9. Boxplot accuracy of IFT prediction models.\nTable 7 shows the percentage accuracy of various IFT pre-\ndiction models. The maximum accuracy obtained is 90.91%\nusing RF for combination 2, where ten input features were\nused. The proposed RF model includes 100 number of deci-\nsion trees. Combinations 8 and 10 show relatively good accu-\nracy with limited measurements. Combination 8 produces an\naccuracy of 90.66%, which used colour, acidity, and CO +\nCO2. Removing CO +CO2 resulted in 89.14% accuracy.\nIn [15], a classiﬁcation accuracy of 87% was achieved\nby predicting the oil IFT using the soft voting classiﬁer.\nHowever, the IFT considered class in this paper was only bad\nand good classes. Ref. [19] predicted the IFT value with an\naccuracy of 95%. Ref. [35] also presented an IFT prediction\nmodel based on oil spectral response. However, these models\nTABLE 7. Accuracy percentage of various IFT prediction models.\nrequire another testing of transformer oil that may not be\ncarried out in Indonesia. The prediction approach presented\nin this paper uses available transformer data in Indonesia\nwithout the need of additional testing.\nOverall, the random forest-based model outperforms other\nalgorithms and the combinations of features result in high\nprediction accuracy. Random forest (RF) is a classiﬁcation\nand regression method, comprising a combination of multiple\ndecision trees where each tree is generated using a random\nvector that is sampled independently of the input vector.\nIn regression, tree predictors use numerical values instead\nof the class labels used by the RF classiﬁer [36]. Several\nstudies have also presented the implementation of RF in the\npower transformer assessment. In [37] an RF technique for\ntransformer failure discrimination is presented and achieved\nan accuracy of 98%. The study in [18] compared several\nmachine learning methods to predict furan levels in trans-\nformer oil, where the RF model produced a good accuracy.\nResearch in [38], [39] developed a partial discharge recog-\nnition model using a variety of machine learning methods,\nof which RF achieved the highest accuracy.\nAnother advantage of the RF is that it is easy to measure the\nrelative importance of each feature to the target. Fig. 10 indi-\ncates that the feature with the highest relative importance\nis the oil colour, followed by acidity, then CO and CO 2,\nand other measurements. The high feature ranking of colour,\nacidity, CO, and CO 2 for IFT prediction agrees well with\nseveral previous studies. In [15], it was found that IFT has\na high correlation with acidity, dissipation factor, and colour.\nAn increase in oil acidity followed by a decrease in IFT is\nshown in [21]. The colour of the transformer oil changes from\nclear light (for new oil) to dark (for used oil) [19]. IFT is very\nsensitive to the presence of degradation products dissolved in\noil. Meanwhile CO and CO 2 are used as indicators for paper\ndegradation.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 74709\nR. A.

Samples of IFT prediction using Random Forest model.\nFig. 11 shows 20 IFT prediction results using the proposed\nRF model based on the measured oil colour and acidity\nparameters. Appendix 2 illustrates twenty samples of trans-\nformers data in which oil IFT value is estimated using the\nproposed Random Forest model. The results show the high\naccuracy of the predicted value compared with the actual\nmeasured value (target).\nTable 8 shows a case study on Transformers 1 and 6,\nin which the IFT measurement is not available and is esti-\nmated using the developed RF model. Available measure-\nments for oil colour and acidity are used to predict the value\nof oil IFT.\nTABLE 8. Implementation of the IFT prediction model for certainty level.\nTABLE 9. Fifty combinations of data unavailability.\nFor TRF1, the predicted IFT is 41.61 mN/m, with a score\nof 1. For TRF6, the acidity is relatively higher, and the oil\ncolour is darker. The prediction model produces an IFT value\nof 29.53 mN/m, with a score of 2. By performing IFT predic-\ntion, the CL of the two transformers is increased from 82 to\n87. However, direct measurement for IFT is recommended\nto increase the conﬁdence level of the resulting transformer\nhealth index.\n74710 VOLUME 9, 2021\nR. A. Prasojoet al.: Dealing With Data Uncertainty for Transformer Insulation System Health Index\nTABLE 10. Twenty samples of transformers data for the proposed IFT\nprediction using Random Forest model.\nV. CONCLUSION\nA method to handle uncertainties due to data unavailability in\ncalculating transformer health index is proposed. In addition,\nthe impact of unavailable data is evaluated and resulted in\nan exponential regression line with a high correlation coefﬁ-\ncient. More unavailable data resulted in less accurate health\nindex. In this case, it is recommended to utilize the certainty\nlevel along with the health index to obtain a better judgment\nof the transformer condition assessment. An interpretation\nguideline using the health index and certainty level is also\nproposed.\nInterfacial tension prediction model is also developed to\nhandle the unavailable data. Various machine learning algo-\nrithms are used to develop the prediction model based on\nseveral collected ﬁeld data. Among the investigated algo-\nrithms, random forest-based prediction model achieved the\nhighest accuracy in estimating the oil IFT based on oil colour\nand acidity. The developed certainty level model can also\naccommodate the results of the IFT prediction into the health\nindex result.\nBy using the certainty level together with the HI value,\na proper asset management decision can be taken on the\ntransformer even with some missed data.\nAPPENDIX\nSee Tables 9 and 10.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
