    "abstract": "ChatGPT is an advanced conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to engage in natural and coherent conversations with users, providing human-like responses to a wide range of topics and questions. It leverages deep learning technique. ChatGPT uses a combination of machine learning techniques, including deep learning and natural language processing, to understand and generate human-like text. The model has been trained on a vast amount of internet text data to ensure its ability to generate relevant and contextually accurate responses. ChatGPT has applications in customer service, virtual assistants, and other conversational interfaces, offering a powerful tool for natural language understanding and generation. It is most likely used to generate human like responses and makes the communication interactive.",
