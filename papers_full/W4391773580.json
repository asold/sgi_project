Within this expansive realm, large language models (LLM) have garnered\nattention for their proficiencies in natural language processing (NLP). These models have demonstrated versatility in\ndiverse broad applications, most recently exemplified by the advent of conversational agents (Radford et al., 2018;\nDevlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020). However, their deployment in specialized scientific domains, particularly\nmedicine, is distinctly challenging (Beam et al., 2023), due to the stringent constraints inherent to medical applications\nand the nuanced, discipline-specific considerations such domains entail (Ling et al., 2023).

Traditional fine-tuning\nmethods are resource-intensive, requiring substantial computational and human capital (Strubell et al., 2019). Con-\nsequently, these methods are often feasible only for large-scale projects with considerable resources (Singhal et al.,\n2022). Another limitation of conventional LLM implementation is interpretability and transparency in information\nprocessing (Holzinger et al., 2017; Lipton, 2018) — a critical requirement for verifiable information generation for\nmedical and research purposes. Furthermore, prevalent LLM are often constrained by token-based context limitations,\nwhich restrict their utility in complex, data-rich environments typical of healthcare and research (Huang et al., 2019).\nHere, we introduce a scalable, verifiable, and hypercontextual solution to specialize LLM, aligning with the principles\nof explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) (Doshi-Velez and Kim, 2017) (Figure 1). Then, we study its diagnostic\nperformance compared to neurologists in complex case scenarios mimicking clinical practice.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Neura — a specialized LLM\nNeura is a solution deploying LLM with custom parameters and prompt engineering on curated corpora with extended\ncontexts (Sciense, New York, US) for advanced retrieval augmented generation (Lewis et al., 2020). This solution\nis predicated on a dual-database architecture integrating both ‘long-term memory’ (LTM) and ‘short-term memory’\n(STM) components. The LTM serves as the repository for domain-specific knowledge. It employs an agnostic, vec-\ntorized approach enabled by text embeddings generated from parsed source texts (Mikolov et al., 2013). The STM\ncaptures the setting and conversational history between the user and the LLM, thereby adding a layer of contextual\nknowledge. The STM is implemented using a non-relational database (Pokorny, 2011), ensuring real-time accessibil-\nity and state persistence of conversational data. Information retrieval is optimized in speed and accuracy through a\nsingle-stage filtering process, integrating vector and metadata indexes into a unified structure (Taipalus, 2023). Source\ntracking is enabled, culminating in actionable, standardized references for the end-user and ensuring verifiability of\nanswer accuracy. For this study, we deployed a state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI, San Francisco, US), on a\nprototype corpus curated for clinical neurology sourced from five comprehensive neurology textbooks (Samuels et al.,\n2014; Jankovic et al., 2021; Campbell and DeJong, 2005; Merritt, 2010), the neurologic disorders section of Merck’s\nManual (copyrighted) (MSD, 2024), and Wikipedia (open-source) (Wikipedia, 2024) (Figure 1).\n2\n .

The first tier required formulating and justifying an exhaustive differential\ndiagnosis based on initial clinical presentation and findings. In the second tier, conclusive clinical information was\nprovided to establish a definitive diagnosis. We recruited senior residents and board-certified neurologists from teach-\ning hospitals in Belgium and France. Neurologists engaged in complex clinical reasoning to solve these diagnostic\nchallenges, solely relying on intrinsic knowledge in the first tier — external resources were permitted in the second\ntier. All challenges were conducted via videoconferencing sessions, supervised by two investigators who provided\ndocuments presenting the cases, initial instructions, and procedural assistance. Answers with timing were recorded\nin text documents, which were subsequently collected and anonymized. Neura undertook the challenges based on the\nsame documents provided to neurologists. Two senior academic neurologists, each responsible for residency training\nand educational programs at their respective universities, independently evaluated the answers, blinded to the involve-\nment of Neura as a participant. They employed a standardized scoring sheet derived from the published corrections\nof the cases, assigning points for precise and justified diagnoses and allowing bonus points for unexpected, relevant\nfindings. Incorrect or risky conclusions incurred deductions, with a two-point loss yielding a null question score. Null\nscores from both evaluators constituted question failure. If multiple participants achieved the maximum score for a\ngiven question, the evaluator chose a preferred answer; conversely, if a single answer attained the maximum score, it\nwas then defined as the highest score. In parallel, an independent investigator assessed the reliability and verifiability\nof the AI-generated information. This was achieved by first classifying the references provided within the answers\nas relevant, irrelevant, or hallucinatory (i.e., incorrect or nonexistent), then ensuring all generated information was\naccurately derived from the cited sources, resulting in a binary outcome (accurate or inaccurate).\n2.3 Statistical analysis\nDescriptive statistics were calculated for the scores and times. For normalization, the maximum possible combined\nscore for each question was determined by summing the highest score assigned by each evaluator. For any participant,\nwe calculated the combined score from both evaluators for each question and then divided this by its maximum possible\ncombined score. These resulting normalized scores were expressed as percentages, indicating the proportion of the\nmaximum possible points each participant collected on a given question. We used the intraclass correlation coefficient\n3\n .

We compared the performance\nof Neura with that of neurologists using a linear mixed-effects model. Before analysis, we used residual plots, QQ\nplots, and Shapiro-Wilk tests to assess the assumptions of normality, homoscedasticity, and random effects structure.\nThis model utilized average scores derived from the two evaluators as the dependent variable. Participant type (Neura\nvs. human) was treated as a fixed effect, while variability across questions was modeled as random. The significance\nof the fixed effect was corroborated using an ANOV A with Satterthwaite’s method for approximating degrees of\nfreedom. We employed a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) of 10,000 iterations to estimate the probabilities for Neura\nachieving observed thresholds of maximum scores, highest scores, and preferred answers among its 20 scores by\nchance — assuming a uniform distribution of scores within each question’s specific range across all participants. We\nset our alpha level threshold at 0.05 to determine statistical significance using two-tailed tests. All computations and\nvisualizations were performed using R version 4.1.3, with the packages: ‘afex,’ ‘eulerr,’ ’ggplot2,’ ’irr,’ ’lme4’, and\n’lmertest.’ Anonymized data not published within this article will be made available by request from any qualified\ninvestigator.\n3 Results\nOf the 13 neurologists, 8 were board-certified. Challenges were conducted between March and October 2023.\nICC(C,2) was found to be significant at 0.767 (95% CI [0.675, 0.833], F(139,139) = 4.3, p < 0.001). The residu-\nals did not significantly deviate from normality (W = 0.99327, p = 0.753, Shapiro-Wilk test) as observed on the QQ\nplot, and plots of residuals versus fitted values supported homoscedasticity. Additionally, random effects for partici-\npants and questions showed substantial variance (0.3789 and 0.3587, respectively, with a residual variance of 1.0584).\nAcross all questions, Neura achieved a significantly higher normalized score of 86.17% versus 55.11% for neurolo-\ngists (SD = 14.81, range = 30.85- 80.85; averages of 66.38% for residents and 48.07% for board-certified physicians)\n— (Estimate = 1.46, Std. Error = 0.39, df = 129, t = 3.75, p < 0.001, linear mixed-effects model, and, F(1, 129)\n= 14.021, p < 0.001, type III ANOV A). For differential diagnosis questions, Neura achieved a normalized score of\n85% versus 46.15% for neurologists (SD = 15.24, range = 26.67-78.33; averages of 58.45% for residents and 39.40%\nfor board-certified physicians). For final diagnosis, Neura achieved a normalized score of 88.24% versus 70.93% for\nneurologists (SD = 17.36, range = 35.29-97.06; averages of 80.5% for residents and 64.87% for board-certified physi-\ncians) (Figure 2). The mean number of null scores and question failures was 2 and 0 for Neura and 2 and 0.4615 for\nneurologists (1 and 0.2 for residents and 2.625 and 0.625 for board-certified physicians). Neura obtained 15 maximum\nscores (p < 0.001, MCS) in its 20 evaluations, 6 of the 8 highest scores (p < 0.001, MCS), and 4 of the 11 preferred\nanswers from both evaluators (p = 0.03, MCS) (Figure 3). In comparison, the best neurologist, a resident, obtained a\nnormalized score of 80.85%, with 9 maximum scores, including 2 highest scores from one evaluator without a pre-\nferred answer and one null score. Neurologists’ mean response times for differential and final diagnosis were 9.62 (SD\n= 4.47, range = 4-32) and 8.85 minutes (SD = 5.53, range = 1-30), compared to Neura’s mean times of 0.48 and 0.317\nminutes, respectively. All references provided by Neura were classified as relevant, and the information generated was\ndeemed accurately derived from the cited sources, with no instances of hallucinatory content detected.\n4\n .

Blindly evaluated in a naturalistic setting, this solution demonstrated diagnostic acumen, perspicuity, and\ncogency on a select set of complex clinical cases compared to a cohort of neurologists. In line with XAI, we confirmed\nits controllability and reliability by ascertaining its provision of verifiable, relevant, and accurate information.\nAcknowledgements\nWe express our gratitude to Fondation de l’Avenirand Acad´emie Nationale de Chirurgie, particularly Prof. Jean-\nJacques Lemaire, Mrs. Marion Lelouvier, Dr. Ingrid Zwaenepoel, Prof. Pascal Rischmann, Dr. Hubert Johanet, Prof.\nAlbert-Claude Benhamou, and Dr. Jean-Claude Couffinhal for their unwavering support.\nReferences\nBeam, A.
