More systematic research is required\non measurement properties of tools for use in this population, in particular to establish\nresponsiveness to change which is essential in measurement of outcomes of intervention.\nPROSPERO Registration Number\nCRD42012002223\nIntroduction\nThere is burgeoning research on how to improve the developmental progress and outcomes for\nyoung children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [1–3]. However, the field is held back by\nthe multiplicity of ways of measuring outcomes [4]. Measurement often focuses on core diag-\nnostic symptoms of autism, or on other characteristics which are expected to be relatively stable\nsuch as IQ, without sufficient attention to the question of how sensitive the tool may be in mea-\nsuring change. Many measurement tools used in intervention and longitudinal observation\nstudies may not have been specifically validated for use with children with ASD, particularly\nthose tools which measure important determinants such as co-occurring conditions.\nThis paper focuses on one such co-occurring condition, behaviour problems in children. In\nthis review, behaviour problems were defined as any behaviours that create problems for or\nchallenge the individual and/or those who take care of them. These include behaviours that are\nnot specific to autism, such as aggression, temper tantrums, non-compliance, as well as more\nspecific problems, such as self-injury and eating non-food substances. Estimates of the preva-\nlence of behaviour problems in ASD vary with the age range studied and the approach used.\nUsing the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL [\n5]), Hartley and colleagues [6] found one third of\n169 children with ASD aged 1.5 to 5.8 years had total problem scores in the clinically signifi-\ncant range. Such behaviours take a heavy toll on families [7].\nThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate the measurement properties of tools used in\nresearch studies to measure behaviour problems in children with ASD aged up to 6 years. It\nbuilds on a large systematic review [8] commissioned in the UK to examine the available evi-\ndence on the measurement properties of tools used to measure progress and outcomes in\nyoung children with ASD. That review was conducted in two stages. The first was to identify\nthe range of tools used in observational and intervention evaluation studies to measure out-\ncomes for children. The second was to systematically search for and review papers about the\nmeasurement properties of those tools when used with young children with autism. The pres-\nent paper evaluates information on tools used to measure behaviour problems, taken from this\nlarger review, and extends it by updating the searches.\nThe review extends earlier work undertaken by the US Autism Speaks Foundation, both in\nscope and the quality of the evidence. In 2011, the Foundation established expert work groups\nto evaluate outcome measurement tools in three subdomains: restricted interests and repetitive\nMeasures of Behaviour Problems in Young Children with Autism\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0144649 December 14, 2015 2/2 1\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nbehaviours [9], anxiety [10], and social communication behaviours [11]. The purpose was to\nidentify tools appropriate for use in medication trials. Tools used in treatment trials of medica-\ntion, complementary medicine or behavioural interventions, from 2005 to 2012, across any age\ngroup of children and youth with ASD, were identified through systematic searches. Other\ntools known to members of the work groups were also included. The tools were rated as: appro-\npriate, appropriate with conditions, potentially appropriate/promising, unproven or not appro-\npriate. The definitions of each level included information on reliability, validity and sensitivity\nto change of the tool, use with individuals with ASD, and also aspects of burden in terms of the\ntime and other difficulties associated with use of the tool in assessment. In each case, a small\nnumber of tools were identified as“appropriate with conditions” (such as restricted age range,\nor lack of information on sensitivity to change).\nThe review on which this paper is based was broader in scope (progress and outcomes)\nthough narrower in age range than the Autism Speaks Foundation work. We extended the\nsearch to include all studies published from 1992 to coincide with the publication of the inter-\nnational classifications, ICD-10 and DSM-IV [\n12, 13]. Further, our inclusion criteria were not\nconfined to measures to be used in medication trials. Further, the measurement properties and\nappropriateness of a tool vary depending on the use to which the tool will be put. In a rando-\nmised trial of early intervention in ASD, for example, it is important to identify a primary out-\ncome that can be assessed‘blind’and is responsive to change. In contrast, when monitoring\nchildren’s progress in a nursery setting, properties of face validity and content validity in rela-\ntion to ASD, test-retest and inter-rater reliability, and measurement burden (cost, training,\ntime) will assume greater importance. The review was registered with PROSPERO Registration\nNumber:\nCRD42012002223\nDevelopment of the review framework\nBefore examining how best to measure something, it is important to know what is important.\nBefore conducting our searches, we therefore undertook consultations with groups of parents\nand young people with ASD, and a survey of early years professionals’practice, to ascertain\nwhat each group of stakeholders considered important to measure by McConachie et al 2015\n[\n8]. Using the findings from these consultations, together with developmental theory and the\nInternational Classification of Functioning [14], we developed a conceptual framework which\nwe used to group 22 sub-domains of measurement tools. Behaviour Problems was one of these.\nFurther consultation was undertaken at the end of the large review, bringing together a range\nof stakeholders (parents, young people with ASD, educationists, clinicians, researchers) for a\nDiscussion Day. A selection of tools with some positive evidence about their measurement\nproperties were looked at in detail by participants, and their views inform some conclusions\ndrawn in this paper.\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards\nare followed in this report (see\nS1 PRISMA Checklist).\nStage 1: Identifying Tools Used to Measure Outcomes in Young\nChildren with ASD\nInclusion criteria— Stage 1\nOur inclusion criteria were as follows [8]:\nTypes of studies. We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials of social, psy-\nchological and educational early interventions for children with a diagnosis of ASD; observa-\ntional studies of children with ASD (cross-sectional and longitudinal); case-control studies,\nMeasures of Behaviour Problems in Young Children with Autism\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0144649 December 14, 2015 3/2 1\nand cohort studies, including studies of baby siblings of children with autism, which provide\ninformation on tools to monitor developmental progress and follow early markers of ASD.\nTypes of participants. Studies of children aged 0–6 years (at study entry) where at least\n50% children were either diagnosed as having ASD or were being monitored for ASD symp-\ntoms. ASD was defined in terms of child participants having a‘best estimate’clinical diagnosis\nof an ASD, including autism, ASD, atypical autism, Asperger syndrome, and PDD-NOS,\naccording to either ICD-10 or DSM-IV [\n12, 13] criteria. Use of a particular diagnostic tool\nsuch as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) [15] or the Autism Diagnostic\nInterview (ADI-R) [16] was not required. Children with ASD and another health or mental\nhealth condition were included.\nTypes of measurement. We included the following types of measures:\n Direct assessment of ASD symptoms by a trained assessor\n Direct assessment of developmental skills, such as language, cognition, play skills, by a\ntrained assessor\n Observational coding of social interaction skills\n Interview or self-completed (parent, teacher or other professional) questionnaire about child\nASD symptoms.\n Interview or questionnaire about developmental skills, i.e. language (vocabulary), adaptive\nfunctioning, with/by parent, teacher or other professional.\n Interview or self-completed (parent, teacher or other professional) questionnaire about asso-\nciated problems: including sleep, eating, toileting, anxiety, hyperactivity, behaviour that chal-\nlenges, aggression, and others identified through parent consultation\n Idiographic measures focussed on particular behaviours (e.g. goal attainment scaling, target\nbehaviours)\n Measures of impact on parent or family.\nWe excluded measures of economic impact on home and family, experimental tasks and\nmeasures (e.g. barrier tasks, reaction time, biophysical measures), medical investigations, or\nprocess measures (e.g. fidelity, adherence, parent satisfaction with intervention).\nSearch strategy— Stage 1\nWe first searched the literature in June and July 2012, and updated this in June and July 2013\n(last search conducted on 17th July 2013). A master search strategy was created and modified\nas needed for searching across the databases. Modifications included changes to syntax, fields\nsearched, and MeSH/thesaurus terms. A list of terms can be found in\nS1 TableSearch Strategy\nalong with an example search strategy for MEDLINE. Full search strategies are available from\nthe corresponding author. Searches were limited to English language articles only. Where pos-\nsible, search filters were used to limit study types returned.\nThe following databases were searched: Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts\n(ASSIA); Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL); the Cochrane Library\n(includes DARE, HTA, CENTRAL, CDSR); ERIC; MEDLINE (including in-process and non-\nindexed); EMBASE; PsycINFO; Sociological Abstracts; Linguistics and Language Behavior\nAbstracts; Health Management Information Consortium (HMIC); PapersFirst (OCLC); Pro-\nceedings (OCLC); SCOPUS; Social Services Abstracts; Web of Science (Science Citation Index,\nMeasures of Behaviour Problems in Young Children with Autism\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0144649 December 14, 2015 4/2 1\nSoc Sci Citation Index, Arts & Humanities Citation Index & Conference Proceedings Citation\nIndex); WorldCatDissertations (OCLC).\nAdditionally, grey literature was searched via Digital Education Resource Archive (DERA),\nOxford Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Database, TRIP Database, internet searches,\nand searching of selected websites. The National Research Register and UK Clinical Research\nNetwork were also searched for ongoing studies.\nSelection of studies— Stage 1\nPapers were first sifted by title and abstract by one of three reviewers (seeFig 1). The decision\ncategories were:‘potentially include’, ‘exclude’, ‘consider for next stage’(i.e. assesses the mea-\nsurement properties of a tool only), or‘unclear’. The three reviewers (Hanratty, Livingstone,\nOono) cross-checked sets of 20 papers at a time until they reached a high level of agreement.\nRegular (at least weekly) discussion of decisions was held throughout the process, to maintain\nconsistency. Then 3059 papers were examined at full text, following the same procedure above.\nWhere decisions regarding inclusion were uncertain, a fourth reviewer (McConachie) made\nthe final decision.\nThere was a further stage of sifting of records found during the search of papers about mea-\nsurement properties of tools for the full review (see below Stage 2). Those searches revealed 118\nrecords potentially relevant to Stage 1. Once duplicates were removed (86), 32 additional rec-\nords were sifted by full text (completed 8\nth December 2013); of these 28 were excluded, and\nfour added to the final total for data extraction.\nData extraction\nUsing a piloted data extraction tool the following data were extracted by one of four reviewers\n(Hanratty, Livingstone, Glod, Oono), with regular checks and discussion to ensure consistency;\nstudy eligibility; type of study; participant characteristics; number of outcome tools (then for\neach tool: name, population for which designed, specific subscales, outcomes measured accord-\ning to authors). Subsequently, two reviewers with expertise in ASD (Rodgers and McConachie)\nreviewed each paper further and indicated which subdomains in the conceptual framework\nwere measured by each tool including subscales. Tools were considered to measure‘behaviour\nproblems’which had a primary focus on externalising behaviours which challenge others,\nwhether or not the tool derived from a definitional framework of psychiatric disorders. (Tools\nwith a primary focus on internalising problems such as anxiety, irritability and distress were\nclassified under Emotional Regulation.)\nResults— Stage 1\nThe search identified 184 papers (see [8], of which twenty-nine measured behaviour problems\n[17–45] using 17 different tools (seeTable 1). Twelve of these tools, reported in 24 papers, were\nconsidered further in Stage 2. Five tools (identified in five papers) were excluded because they\nwere either developedad hocfor use in particular studies [17, 21, 35], were adaptations of tools\nfor use in another language [22], or were used only in outcome and monitoring studies pub-\nlished before 1995 [38] (given different diagnostic definitions for ASD before 1994).\nThe majority of studies were conducted in the USA (13), the UK (4), or Australia (5), with\none study conducted in each of France and Holland respectively. Study designs included RCTs\n(4), Quasi-experimental studies (3) longitudinal (9) and cross sectional (8) observational stud-\nies. Sample sizes ranged from 16 to 762 with an age range of 18 months up to 6 years of age an\noverall mean age of 4 years. In 16 studies all participants had an ASD diagnosis.

Studies included at least 50% children with ASD or were being monitored for\nASD symptoms even if they had another primary diagnosis (e.g., a paper monitoring ASD\nsymptoms in a Fragile X population could be eligible if exploring measurement properties of a\ntool used as an outcome).\nWe included studies of tools identified at Stage 1 (i.e. used for monitoring and/or to measure\noutcome in a longitudinal or intervention study with children with ASD up to 6 years old) was\nthe focus of the study.\nThe aim of the study was the development of a measurement tool or the evaluation of one\nor more of its measurement properties. We excluded papers in which one or more of the fol-\nlowing applied:\nTable 1.

Studies in which the focus of the paper was not the examination of measurement properties\nwere not eligible (for example, if the paper focused only on creating a subtype of ASD, or to\ngroup individuals by scores on the tool).\n5. With regard to papers on translated tools, if the purpose was only to check the translation,\nthen it was not eligible. If the purpose was to explore the tool’s validity in a different culture/\ncountry, and the focus was on the properties of the tool, and the findings appear relevant for\nuse in UK, then it was included.\nSearch strategy— Stage 2\nSearches for Stage 2 were first conducted in March and April 2013, with iterative searches run\nin August, September and November 2013 and December 2014 (final search conducted on\n22nd December 2014). The databases searched were: ERIC; MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL;\nPsycINFO. Again, searches were limited to English language papers only, and papers published\nfrom 1992 to present.\nIn order to search for papers describing studies of the measurement properties of tools, a\nsearch filter developed by the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health\nstatus Measurement INstruments) group was applied [\n49]. The COSMIN filter was originally\ndesigned for use in PubMed, and was translated for use in other databases by our Information\nSpecialist (Robalino). The translation was tested in OVID, and discrepancies were discussed\nwith Terwee (co-investigator, and part of the team who devised COSMIN). The sensitivity of\nthe revised filters was tested continuously through the early part of data extraction, through\ninspection of references for‘marker’papers which should have been included, until the new fil-\nters were judged satisfactory. The translation can be found in\nS1 Text: COSMIN Translation.\nEach search consisted of four components: Autism terms, age group terms, COSMIN filter,\nand tool name. A master search strategy was created and modified as needed for searching in\nvarious databases. Tool names required basic searches in their own right to determine variant\nspellings, variant names, and to include acronyms. For example, numerous tools include the\nword ‘scale’, but this might have been reported as‘scales’, ‘scale’, ‘score’,o r‘scores’by the\nauthors. Some databases, notably PsycInfo, include a field for tests and measures, and this was\nutilised if available since this provides a standard way of identifying a tool regardless of how an\nauthor has reported the title.\nFinally, the searches in Stage 1 had identified two studies [\n50, 51] which were about the\nmeasurement properties of identified tools for measuring behaviour problems and these were\nalso included in Stage 2 (\nFig 2).\nSelection of studies\nFour reviewers (Glod, Hanratty, Livingstone, Oono) utilised the criteria to sift 10% of the arti-\ncles independently and to compare results, resulting in tightening of criteria. Sifting was then\nconducted by a single reviewer, the team having (at random) divided up assessment of titles\nand abstracts, selection of full-text articles and consultation of reference lists of the studies\nMeasures of Behaviour Problems in Young Children with Autism\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0144649 December 14, 2015 8/2 1\nFig 2.

In case of uncertainty, the paper was discussed with McConachie before making the\ndecision regarding inclusion. As the COSMIN rating procedure (see below) involves two stages,\nand the second summary stage involved a different member of the team (including McCona-\nchie) in rating the content of each article, some further exclusions were made, in a robust deci-\nsion-making procedure.\nEvaluation of methodological quality\nThe methodological quality of Stage 2 included studies was assessed using the COSMIN check-\nlist [\n52]. This checklist has 9 subscales (internal consistency, reliability, measurement error,\ncontent validity, structural validity, hypothesis testing, cross-cultural validity, criterion validity,\nresponsiveness) with standards for how each measurement property should be assessed. Each\nitem is scored on a four point rating scale (poor to excellent) and an overall rating for the meth-\nodological quality of each study is determined per measurement property by taking the lowest\nscore of any item in a box (“worst score counts” method)[\n53].\nFor each study, the reviewer extracted relevant numerical and descriptive information about\nthe properties addressed (available from the corresponding author). Terwee et al. presented cri-\nteria for judging the adequacy of each piece of information [54] (seeS2 Table: Quality criteria\nfor good measurement properties).\nRatings of study quality were then combined with the ratings of strength of the findings (see\nTable 2) in order to make overall judgements of each measurement tool.\nResults— Stage 2\nWe found no papers meeting our Stage 2 inclusion criteria for six of the 12 tools identified in\nStage 1 (seeTable 1). The following summarises the available evidence on the remaining six\ntools for which data are available on their measurement properties when used with children\nwith ASD.\nThe six tools comprise four tools specifically designed for use in relation to individuals with\ndisabilities, as well as the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC)— Parent Rating\nScales, Second Edition [\n55], and two versions of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)[5, 56].\nThe latter two tools were not designed specifically for use with disabled children and young\npeople, but have been widely used with this population.\nDescription of behaviour problems tools\nThe Aberrant Behaviour Checklist(ABC) [57] is a caregiver report checklist designed to\nassess maladaptive behaviours in people with developmental disabilities, from age 6 years\nTable 2.

It therefore only just overlaps with the target age group for the review. It has 58 items\nand is available in 40 languages. It was used in four observational studies [18, 20, 30, 45]i nt h e\nreview with children as young as 3 years.\nThe Baby and Infant Screen for Children with aUtIsm Traits, Part 3(BISCUIT-Part 3)\n[58] is a short scale of 15 items, focused on infants with Autism aged 17 to 37 months of age, to\nassess challenging behaviours. It presents clinical cut-off scores for no or minimal impairment,\nmoderate impairment, and severe impairment. It was used in one observational study in the\nreview [\n40].\nThe Behavior Assessment System for Children Second Edition(BASC-2)[55] is a widely\nused tool for assessing behaviour and emotions in children, adolescents and young adults,\nranging in age from 2 to 22 years old. The BASC-2 consists of a Structured Developmental His-\ntory, an Observation System, a Parent Rating Scale (134–160 items depending on age), a Self-\nReport of Personality Scale, and a Teacher Rating Scale (100–139 items). It was used to mea-\nsure behaviour problems in one observational study in the review [26].\nThe Child Behavior Checklist(CBCL)[5, 56]. This tool is part of the Achenbach System of\nEmpirically Based Assessment. It is a widely used tool, with two formats for children at differ-\nent age bands. This is a particular strength for longitudinal studies, and both versions are\nincluded in the review. The 1.5–5 year format has 99 items, and the 6–18 years version has 118\nitems, with norms available for typically developing children. The items can be scored on psy-\nchiatric scales related to DSM, though this may not be relevant for children with ASD up to 6\nyears. It was used in three observational [\n19, 24, 43] and three [32, 41, 42] intervention evalua-\ntion studies in this review.\nThe CBCL was one of the two behaviour questionnaires presented to participants at the Dis-\ncussion Day. They liked the clear instructions, with a time frame of two months, and the wide\nrange of questions, including a qualitative section at the end enquiring about the best things\nabout the child. However they considered that the three point scale may not provide sufficient\nrange to capture change. The participants noted that the short questions do not establish the\nunderlying reasons why a child might show the behaviours.\nThe Home Situations Questionnaire— Pervasive Developmental Disorders version\n(HSQ-PDD)[\n59], more recently referred to as the HSQ-ASD [60], is a 25 item caregiver ques-\ntionnaire designed to assess behavioural non-compliance in everyday situations by children. It\nwas modified from the original Home Situations Questionnaire [61] by Chowdhury et al. [59]\nfor use in assessment of children with ASD aged 3 to 14 years, and originates from the Research\nUnits in Pediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network. The HSQ-PDD was used in one\nintervention evaluation study [20] in the review.\nThe Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form(NCBRF)[62] is a rating scale designed to\nassess social competence and problem behaviour in children with developmental disabilities.\nThere are parent and teacher versions of the scale, which has 76 items altogether, with 10 posi-\ntive social items before the 66 problem items. Parents are also invited to mention special cir-\ncumstances which may have affected the child’s behaviour in the last month. The age range for\nthe NCBRF is 3 to 16 years.\nThis tool was also examined by participants at the Discussion Day, who particularly appre-\nciated that the items included some which were relevant to ASD. However, participants\nthought some items were poorly worded (e.g.“resisted provocation”), several were not relevant\nto children in the age range up to 6 years (including items such as“feels worthless or inferior”)\nand some items would be typical for a 3 year old (e.g.“runs away from adults”). This tool was\nused in one intervention evaluation study [\n36] in the review.\nMeasures of Behaviour Problems in Young Children with Autism\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0144649 December 14, 2015 11 / 21\nMeasurement properties\nThe searches identified 15 papers that assessed one or more of the measurement properties of\nthese six tools [50, 51, 58, 59, 63–73]. Table 3details the evidence found for each tool and\nTable 4summarises the overall strength and quality of evidence relating to each of the tools.\n(See section on‘Evaluation of methodological quality’above.)\nAberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC).The ABC [57] items are scored in five subscales:\nIrritability, Lethargy/Social Withdrawal, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity/Non-compliance,\nand Inappropriate speech. Internal consistency was reported as good by Karabekiroglu and\nAman [\n50] (Cronbach’s alphas from 0.68 to 0.90) and by Kaat, Lecavalier and Aman [66]\n(alphas from .77 to .94). Inter-rater reliability (between similar raters) and test-retest reliability\nwere not assessed. Brinkley et al. [\n64] and Kaat, Lecavalier and Aman [66] demonstrated that\nthe ABC had good structural validity; the latter very large study (n = 1893) found that 90% of\nitems matched the standard ABC factor structure, though model fit was‘marginal’(Root Mean\nSquare Error of Approximation (RMSEA) was .086). Sigafoos et al. [73] also showed that the\nABC had good structural validity with five factors, though due to the small sample size\n(n = 32), the Sigafoos paper was judged to be of poor methodological quality. Karabekiroglu\nand Aman [50] showed that the ABC distinguished between clinical subgroups. Kaat, Lecava-\nlier and Aman [66] found as expected that irritability and hyperactivity decreased with age.\nKaat, Lecavalier and Aman [66] and Karabekiroglu and Aman [50] found predicted significant\ncorrelations with related constructs measured by the Child Behaviour Checklist and the Autism\nBehaviour Checklist, and Kuhlthau et al [\n67] with a measure of child quality of life, the Child\nHealth and Illness Profile— Child Edition.\nBaby and Infant Screen for Children with aUtIsm Traits— Part 3 (BISCUIT-Part 3).\nThe BISCUIT-Part 3 [58] items are organised into three subscales: Aggressive/Disruptive\nbehaviours, Stereotypic behaviours, and Self-Injurious behaviour. Internal consistency of the\nBISCUIT-Part 3 was reported as good with Cronbach’s alpha>0.70 in two papers [58, 71] but\nreliability was not assessed. Structural validity, assessed in Matson, Boisjoli et al [71] was not\nacceptable, with the exploratory factor analysis resulting in a three factor solution explaining\njust 38.32% of the variance.\nBehavior Assessment System for Children Second Edition (BASC-2).The BASC-2 Par-\nent and Teacher Rating Scale [55] items are organised into 9 clinical subscales: Aggression,\nAnxiety, Attention problems, Atypicality, Conduct problems, Depression, Hyperactivity,\nSomatization, Withdrawal (as well as five adaptive scales). Hass et al. [65] showed that the\nBASC-2 had acceptable internal consistency for the 10 item aggression scale and the 9 item\nconduct problem scale with teachers as informants. There were also significant large differ-\nences between children with ASD and matched controls on the aggression scale (Cohen’s\nd = 0.58) and the externalising problems composite scale (Cohen’s d = 0.75). Mahan and Mat-\nson [\n70] also assessed known groups validity of the BASC-2, with parents as informants. ASD\nchildren scored significantly greater than typically developing children on the conduct prob-\nlems and externalising composite scales, but did not differ as expected on the aggression sub-\nscale. No evidence was found on reliability, structural validity or criterion validity for the\nclinical scales.\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5–5. CBCL 1.5–5 year [\n5] subscale scores are derived\nfor the following syndromes: Emotionally Reactive, Anxious/Depressed, Somatic Complaints,\nWithdrawn, Sleep Problems, Attention problems, and Aggressive Behaviour, and these are fur-\nther summed to provide scores for Internalizing and Externalizing problems.\nThe CBCL 1.5–5 was assessed by one paper of good methodological quality [72] with a sam-\nple of children with ASD. This paper provided evidence of good internal consistency for total\nMeasures of Behaviour Problems in Young Children with Autism\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0144649 December 14, 2015 12 / 21\nproblems (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93) and both the externalizing behaviour domain (Cronbach’s\nalpha = 0.90) and aggressive behaviour sub-scale (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.80). No evidence was\nfound concerning reliability. Structural validity was also good with acceptable model fit for a\none factor model for aggressive behaviour (RMSEA<0.06, Comparative Fit Index (CFI)>0.95)\nindicating that there was a single latent factor underlying this sub-scale.\nChild Behavior Checklist 6–18. The CBCL 6–18 [56] was assessed with a sample of ASD\nyouth in two papers [51, 67]. Pandolfi, Magyar and Dill [51] found internal consistency was\ngood with r = 0.92 for the aggressive behaviour scale, but no evidence was found concerning\nreliability. Structural validity for the complete measure was good and analysis supported the\noriginal two factor structure of the CBCL 6–18 (internalizing and externalising factors). Tests\nof unidimensionality of scales did not reach the cut off for acceptable fit for aggressive behav-\niour (RMSEA = 0.10, CFI = 0.95); however, convincing arguments were provided to allow for\ncorrelated disturbances in the model for two item pairs (destroys own things/destroys others\nthings and disobedient at home/disobedient at school). This adjusted model demonstrated\nacceptable fit (RMSEA<0.06, CFI>0.95). Criterion validity was assessed by Pandolfi, Magyar\nTable 3.

Children with a co-occurring EBD scored significantly higher than those\nwithout EBDs on total problems, though there were no significant differences between the two\ngroups for aggressive behaviour or externalising behaviour as the most common co-occurring\nEBDs in the sample were anxiety disorders. Kuhlthau et al [\n67] hypothesised that externalising\nbehaviours would be more strongly associated with quality of life than internalising behaviours\nin children with ASD, but this was not supported.\nHome Situations Questionnaire-Pervasive Developmental Disorders version\n(HSQ-PDD). The HSQ-PDD [59] items are scored in two subscales: Socially Inflexible, and\nDemand-Specific. The properties of the HSQ-PDD were assessed in a sample of 124 children\naged 4 to 13 years. Structural validity for a two factor solution was a reasonable fit (RMSEA\n0.06) and internal consistency good (alpha 0.90 for the‘socially inflexible’subscale and 0.80 for\n‘demand-specific’). Known groups validity and responsiveness (change over time) were also\nshown as good for the HSQ-PDD by Chowdhury et al [\n59]. In a further paper, responsiveness\nwas shown related as hypothesised to change in the Vineland Daily Living Skills scale [63].\nNisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF).The NCBRF [62] has six problem\nbehaviour subscales: Conduct Problem, Insecure/Anxious, Hyperactive, Self-Injury/Stereo-\ntypic, Self-isolated/Ritualistic, and Overly Sensitive. Internal consistency of the problem behav-\niour scales was reported as good with Cronbach’s alpha>0.70 for all subscales in both parent\nand teacher versions [\n68]. Test-retest reliability for the parent version was reported to be strong\n(ICC for total problem behaviour>0.80) but the teacher version fell short of the COSMIN cri-\nterion (ICC for total problem behaviour = 0.68); however, over a one year time interval some\nchange might well be expected. Agreement was low between parents and teachers on common\nitems from the parent and teacher versions of the scale, indicating that inter-rater reliability\nTable 4.

Structural validity was also shown to be poor for problem behaviour with a 5\nfactor solution accounting for 47.5% of the variance [68]. Finally, Lecavalier, Leone & Wiltz\n[69] provided fair evidence for divergent and convergent validity of the NCBRF though crite-\nrion validity was not assessed.\nDiscussion\nThe evidence presented here on the measurement properties of six tools used to measure\nbehaviour problems in young children with ASD is good in parts, and strikingly thin in others.\nFirstly, for these six tools there is little evidence on reliability, and where present the quality\nof the evidence is‘fair’at best. There is a need to know how much variability there may be in\nadult reports of children’s behaviour when making judgements about the significance of\nchange over time.\nSecondly, the difficulties for researchers in designing studies to establish whether tools are\nsensitive to change are crucially dependent on both intervention and measurement. That is, it\nis necessary to have clear evidence of treatment effect on one responsive tool in order to test\nwhether a new tool is also responsive. Only the HSQ-PDD team have considered this question\nexplicitly within a treatment study. Such attention to responsiveness in the development of a\ntool is important in strengthening the evidence-base for particular treatment approaches (e.g.\nparent training for disruptive behaviours [\n74]).\nThirdly, the evidence for the structural validity of tools was somewhat mixed, with factor\nanalyses presented for the BISCUIT-Part 3 and the NCBRF accounting for rather low propor-\ntions of the variance in the data.\nA fourth weakness is the lack of reported ASD-specific work on content validity, particularly\nin the case of the CBCL and BASC-2 designed originally for typical populations. A source of\ndifficulty in evaluation of measurement tools is the challenge in separating out the measure-\nment of autism characteristics from other problems measured, such as behaviour problems or\nanxiety [\n75]. In the case of the CBCL, Hus and colleagues [76] have shown that higher Social\nResponsiveness Scale scores (measuring ASD characteristics) were associated with greater\nbehaviour problems in 2368 children with ASD, mean age 8 years, and in their non-affected\nsiblings. The authors concluded that report of the severity of ASD characteristics may be influ-\nenced by factors that are not specific to ASD. However, equally it seems that behaviours such\nas ‘doesn’t answer when people talk to him/her’or ‘strange behavior’are labeled as‘behaviour\nproblems’in the questionnaires when their primary characteristic appears to relate to ASD.\nOverall, in terms of strength of measurement properties the choice appears to fall between\nthe CBCL and the HSQ-PDD. The CBCL was not designed for children with disability and lack\nof evidence on content validity in use with children with ASD is a weakness; however, the exis-\ntence of compatible forms across a wide age range is a strength. The availability of norms may\nalso be of use (however, see comments above concerning content validity). Further evidence on\ntest-retest and inter-rater reliability, and sensitivity to change, when used with young children\nwith ASD would be valuable. The HSQ-PDD is a relatively new tool, and the team are continu-\ning to explore the strongest grouping of items [\n77]. Further evidence of its measurement prop-\nerties, by teams other than the original developers, will strengthen conclusions about its\nusefulness in future.\nStrengths and limitations of the evidence\nThis systematic review had some limitations of method, notably the restriction of studies to\nthose reported in English. The restricted age range for the review— the measurement properties\nof tools used with children with ASD up to the age of six years— can be considered a limitation\nMeasures of Behaviour Problems in Young Children with Autism\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0144649 December 14, 2015 15 / 21\nwhere researchers wish for evidence on the robustness of tools used to measure outcomes in\nolder individuals on the autism spectrum (e.g. drug trials, interventions in education settings).\nNevertheless, the evidence presented is intended to offer guidance to those conducting psycho-\nsocial interventions with preschool children. A further limitation is that the two-stage search\nprocess will have missed examination of tools used in more recent early intervention evaluation\nand observational studies. However, the strengths of the review lie in the wide search strategies\nutilised, and a team of reviewers working together consistently.\nThe findings of the review have been hampered by a lack of articles identified which specifi-\ncally consider measurement properties of tools in use with children with ASD. We had\nintended to extract information about the reliability, validity and responsiveness to change of\ntools as described in the intervention evaluation and observational studies (Stage 1), but most\nstudies simply cited the reliability and validity of tools from their source references, irrespective\nof whether this had been tested with samples of children with ASD. Furthermore, it was not\npossible to interpret the evidence on responsiveness to change without considering whether\nthe study was adequately powered to detect change, and whether the choice of outcome tool\nwas appropriate to the nature of the intervention. If a significant intervention effect was not\nshown, there were a number of possible reasons, and the properties of the tool constituted only\none of those reasons. Therefore, the decision was taken to rely only on the systematic assess-\nment of measurement properties of tools described in Stage 2 for the evaluation.\nOther approaches to measurement of behaviour problems\nSix tools were found at Stage 1 for which no articles appeared to have considered their mea-\nsurement properties in use with children with ASD. One of these was an approach which indi-\nvidualises assessment for children,‘Target Behaviours’. With the individuality of needs of\nyoung children with ASD, it may be particularly appropriate to adopt an idiographic approach\nto outcome measurement such as this, or Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS). Although the focus\nis individual, the scoring systems enable comparison across individuals. The Target Behaviours\n(or target symptoms) methodology was included in the battery of tools recommended by the\nResearch Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology [\n78] and used by one study in this review\n[20]. Where a specific behaviour is the target of intervention, the parent is interviewed about\nits nature, frequency and intensity, and a vignette description is prepared. At follow-up the\nsame questions are asked about the behaviour; the two vignettes are then compared and rated\nfor degree of change on a 9 point scale by an expert panel. Thus this idiographic measure allows\nfor ‘blind’rating, and provides an opportunity to capture change. Inter-rater reliability across\nthe expert panel can be assessed. GAS requires greater professional input (than Target Behav-\niours), including training and practice, to enable a suitable behavioural goal to be defined and\nscaled (with description of outcomes on a 5 point scale between‘worst expected outcome’to\n‘best expected outcome’). There are continuing debates about appropriate statistical analyses of\nGAS scores, such as whether accomplishment of different individual goals can be summed into\na group score. Nevertheless if the GAS scores are done by observation, the assessor can be\n‘blind’[\n79]. These approaches to responsive measurement of relevant and individualised out-\ncomes merit further exploration for young children with ASD.\nIn the process of the final sifting for Stage 2, four other‘new’tools were identified that mea-\nsured behaviour problems and had been used to describe young children with ASD, but not in\nthe intervention and observation studies searched for in Stage 1. These are the Behaviour Func-\ntion Inventory [\n80], the Behavior Problems Inventory [81] (and its Short form [46]), the Chil-\ndren’s Scale of Hostility and Aggression: Reactive/Proactive [82], and the Child’s Challenging\nBehaviour Scale [83]. Future updates of the review will, hopefully, include evidence about these\nMeasures of Behaviour Problems in Young Children with Autism\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0144649 December 14, 2015 16 / 21\ntools and their use in outcome measurement in evaluation and observation studies with young\nchildren with ASD. As the requirements for establishing the measurement properties of a tool\nbecome more standardised [84] and better understood, it is anticipated that the quality of the\navailable evidence will be higher.\nIn summary, despite the strong likelihood of problem behaviours in young children with\nASD, and consequently the need for effective intervention approaches, there are significant\nlimitations in the measurement tools currently in use in intervention evaluation and observa-\ntional studies. The paper identifies the strongest candidate measurement tools to be used in\nfuture studies, and suggests the gaps in knowledge which require to be filled.\nSupporting Information\nS1 PRISMA Checklist.
