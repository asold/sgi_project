  "abstract": "The use of natural language processing (NLP) models, including the more recent large language models (LLM) in real-world applications obtained relevant success in the past years. To measure the performance of these systems, traditional performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score are used. Although it is important to measure the performance of the models in those terms, natural language often requires an holistic evaluation that consider other important aspects such as robustness, bias, accuracy, toxicity, fairness, safety, efficiency, clinical relevance, security, representation, disinformation, political orientation, sensitivity, factuality, legal concerns, and vulnerabilities. To address the gap, we introduce LangTest, an open source Python toolkit, aimed at reshaping the evaluation of LLMs and NLP models in real-world applications. The project aims to empower data scientists, enabling them to meet high standards in the ever-evolving landscape of AI model development. Specifically, it provides a comprehensive suite of more than 60 test types, ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of a model's behavior and responsible AI use. In this experiment, a Named Entity Recognition (NER) clinical model showed significant improvement in its capabilities to identify clinical entities in text after applying data augmentation for robustness.",
