Metagenomes contain millions\nof unknown Cas proteins. Traditional mining relies on protein sequence\nalignments. In this work,we employ an evolutionary scale language model\n(ESM) to learn the information beyond sequences. Trained with CRISPR-Cas\ndata, ESM accurately identiﬁes Cas proteins withoutalignment. Limited\nexperimental data restricts feature prediction, but integrating with machine\nlearning enablestrans-cleavage activity prediction of uncharacterized Cas12a.\nWe discover 7 undocumented Cas12a subtypes with unique CRISPR loci.\nStructural analyses reveal 8 subtypes of Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4. Cas12a subtypes\ndisplay distinct 3D-folds. CryoEM analyses unveil unique RNA interactions with\nthe uncharacterized Cas12a. These proteins show distinct double-strand and\nsingle-strand DNA cleavage preferences and broad PAM recognition. Finally,\nwe establish a speciﬁc detection strategy for the oncogene SNP without tra-\nditional Cas12a PAM. This study highlights the potential of language models in\nexploring undocumented Cas protein function via gene cluster classiﬁcation.\nClustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)\nand CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins constitute the adaptive immune\nsystem in prokaryotes to defend against invasive genetic elements\n1.\nThe CRISPR-Cas systems keep evolving during natural evolution, cur-\nrently, two classes have been identiﬁed, and new subtypes are\nemerging2. Class 1 comprises types I, III, and IV, featuring multiple Cas\nproteins as effector modules. Class 2 comprises types II, V, and VI,\nmainly using single multidomain proteins, e.g., Cas9, Cas12, and Cas13,\nas effector modules. Due to its ease of reprogrammability, class 2 Cas\nproteins have been widely applied in gene editing, nucleic acid\ndetection, imaging, and annotation, which has led to the research\nrevolution from basic science to translational medicine\n3.N o v e l\nCRISPR-Cas discovery is fundamental for the technology iteration.\nMetagenome provides a precious reservoir for the novel Cas\nexploration.

Nevertheless, millions of unknown Cas pro-\nteins, scattered in the metagenomes, are still waiting to be\ncharacterized.\nTraditional Cas protein mining mainly depends on the primary\nsequences to predict the protein function and classiﬁcation\n2.S e q u e n c e\nsimilarity-based search could be performed by Basic Local Alignment\nSearch Tool (BLAST) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM)\n7,8.B a s e do n\nthe sequence similarity search, MacSyFinder and HMMCAS have been\ndeveloped\n9,10. But these methods are restrained by the known Cas\nsequence and are difﬁcult to discover new Cas proteins. Machine\nlearning-based methods predict Cas proteins in a data-driven manner,\nfor example, CASpredict, CASboundary, and CRISPRCasTyper\n11– 13.\nHowever, the protein function is directly determined by the three-\ndimensional structure, but not amino acid sequences. Learning the\nhidden biological information from protein sequences motivates the\ndevelopment of various evolutionary-scale language models\n14.T h e y\ncan predict secondary structure and tertiary structures15,16. Recently,\nstructure-based protein clustering discovered undocumented clades\nof deaminase and generated an efﬁcient cytosine base editor, indi-\ncating the importance of structural information in protein discovery\n17.\nIn addition to the three-dimensional structural information, an alter-\nnative approach could be the evolutionary-scale language model. The\nrecently developed ESM-2 language model, scaling up to 15 billion\ntrainable parameters, can capture the protein feature at the atomic-\nresolution level\n18.\nHere, we develop an Artiﬁcial Intelligence-assisted CRISPR-Cas\nScan (AIL-Scan) strategy based on the ESM language model19.A f t e r\ntraining with the CRISPR-Cas sequences and their functional annota-\ntion, the AIL-Scan can accurately distinguish the different CRISPR-Cas\ntypes from the annotated genome sequences. However, only a few Cas\nproteins are experimentally evaluated. We integrate the ESM and\nmachine learning on small sample size data and develop atrans-clea-\nvage activity prediction model with accuracy. The Cas12a family is\ntaken as an example to explore in the metagenomic database. Different\nfrom the classical CRISPR loci of Cas12a, we discovered eight subtypes\nof the Cas12a family, which are characterized by the unique organi-\nzation of CRISPR loci and protein sequences. Furthermore, the inte-\ngrase proteins, i.e., Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4, also have eight subtypes,\nrespectively, according to the structural alignments. The missing\nintegrase proteins result in a decrease in spacer numbers in the\nCRISPR-loci. In addition, the unreported Cas12a proteins show diverse\n3D foldings between subtypes. The CryoEM analyses further discover\nunique interaction patterns with RNA. Accordingly, these proteins\nshow distinct double-strand and single-strand DNA cleavage pre-\nferences and broad PAM recognition, which enables the speciﬁc\ndetection of the oncogene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)\nwithout traditional Cas12a PAM and efﬁcient cellular gene editing with\nminimal off-targets. The study provides new insights into machine\nlearning in the discovery of undocumented functional Cas proteins via\ngene cluster classiﬁcation.\nResults\nDevelopment of an Artiﬁcial Intelligence-assisted CRISPR-Cas\nScan (AIL-Scan) strategy based on an ESM large language model\nWe assumed that by embedding the functional feature with protein\nprimary sequences, we could trace the natural evolution rules and\nidentify the CRISPR-Cas proteins in the metagenomics data directly\nwithout sequence alignments. To identify the CRISPR-Cas proteins,\nwe developed an Artiﬁcial Intelligence-assisted CRISPR-Cas Scan (AIL-\nScan) strategy (Fig.1a). It includes the following steps:\n1. CRISPR-Cas training data is created by extracting CRISPR-\nassociated (Cas) proteins from the NCBI database, classifying\nthem by genes, and removing redundant sequences.\n2. Supervised ﬁne-tuning of ESM on the CRISPR-Cas training data\nbased on the biological information to predict the Cas protein.\n3. Feature analyses of Cas proteins, including cleavage activity,\nCRISPR-loci type, CRISPR loci-length, direct repeats, spacers,\nevolutionary analyses, MSA, and structures.\nWe generated our training data using reviewed NCBI gene data.\nWe annotated the Cas1, Cas2, Cas3, Cas4, Cas5, Cas6, Cas7, Cas8, Cas9,\nCas10, Cas12, and Cas13. Non-Cas proteins were extracted according to\nthe following rules, without the annotation of Cas, and removing the\nproteins with sequence similarity over 40%. The Cas protein database\nwas separated into a training or validation database using CD-HIT-2D\nwith a 40% identity threshold to remove the redundant sequences and\navoid over ﬁtting. We collected 76567 non-redundant positive\nsequences and 13047 non-Cas proteins, which were deposited in NCBI\nbefore July 5, 2023 (Supplementary Fig. 1). The maximal protein length\nis less than 1764 amino acids. To obtain the best classiﬁcation, we\nintroduced the“focal loss” in the classiﬁcation to solve the unbalance\nof the input data. We obtained the best model during the 13\nth Epoch of\nmodel training and obtained 97.75% accuracy for the ESM 2 model with\n650 million (650 M) parameters (Supplementary Fig. 2). Using the 15\nbillion (15B) parameters model, we achieved the best performance in\nthe 9\nth Epoch with 98.22% accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 2). This model\nmaintained consistent performance, achieving an accuracy 97.68% on\nthe independent dataset, i.e. TestSet2024, which contains sequences\ndeposited in NCBI from July 6, 2023, to Oct 28, 2024 (Supplementary\nTables 1– 3). These results indicate a robust generalization of this\nmodel. The accuracy and prediction speed of AIL-Scan is comparable\nto the CRISPRcasIdentiﬁer, which integrates HMMs and machine\nlearning (Table1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). CASPredict performed\nwith the highest speed among the four software, although its accuracy\nis lower than the machine learning based software, i.e., AIL-Scan and\nCRISPRcasIdentiﬁer. However, the NCBI data has been partially anno-\ntated by the HMM model, so we turned to validate AIL-Scan’s capability\nin recognizing“unseen proteins”. We utilized a recent dataset of 3601\nCas12 family protein sequences\n20, in which 3521 sequences (97.8%) had\nless than 90% similarity with the training set, meanwhile 3351 sequen-\nces (93.1%) had less than 40% similarity with the training set. This test\nset is named TestSet2025 and is signiﬁcantly distinct from the training\nset in sequence space, making it suitable for evaluating generalization\nability. AIL-Scan successfully identiﬁed 3182 Cas12 proteins, in con-\ntrast, the HMM model identiﬁed 1240 sequences, demonstrating the\nstrong generalization capabilities of AIL-Scan. Considering the\nresource consumption, the 650M model is sufﬁcient for the Cas pre-\ndiction. We used ESM embeddings to reduce dimensionality with t-SNE\nfor 77684 sequences and discovered that ESM can distinguish the\ndifferences in various Cas classiﬁcations. The ROC curves and AUC\nindicate the probability that the positive sample’sd e c i s i o nv a l u ei s\ngreater than the negative sample’s decision value for all the Cas and\nnon-Cas proteins (Fig.1b). The test loss and test accuracy also indicate\nthat the model generalizes correctly and performs well on unseen data\n(Fig. 1c). We evaluated the model robustness using the 5-fold cross-\nvalidation. The average accuracy is 0.9786 and the standard deviation\nis 0.0013 (Supplementary Table 4).\nWe use the Global Microbial Gene Catalog (GMGC) metagenomic\ndatabase for the Cas protein discovery\n21. We selected 50,000 bins with\nhigh quality from GMGC and extracted 20,000 MAGs, including\nCRISPR-loci, to test the performance of AIL-Scan. The protein\nsequences were predicted by Prodigal software\n22. We collected ca.\n20,000,000 protein sequences shorter than 1500 amino acids for\nprediction. In comparison with the established methods, the AIL-Scan\npredicts 1379 Cas12a sequences.\nDevelopment of atrans-cleavage activity prediction model\nThe trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a has been used in various appli-\ncations.

A total of 69 labeled Cas12a proteins (including three\nknown Cas12a) were included in our analysis (Supplementary Data 1).\nTheir trans-cleavage activities were assessed by the ﬂuorophore-\nquencher (FQ) reporter assay. Thetrans-cleavage activity was deﬁned\nas proteins displayingﬂuorescence intensity twice that of the negative\ncontrol. Thirty-three proteins were classiﬁed as active intrans-cleavage\nactivity, and the remaining 36 proteins were categorized as inactive. To\nevaluate the performance of our predictive model, a test set com-\nprising 13 randomly selected proteins (approximately 20% of the\nsample) was used, while the remaining 56 proteins were employed for\ntraining purposes. Initially, we recorded the last embedding layers\nbased on ourﬁne-tuned ESM model for all labeled Cas12a protein\nsequences. These embeddings (1280 dimensions) were utilized as\ncovariates to predicttrans-cleavage activity.\nDifferent forms of decision tree models are evaluated in this\ntask. The results of our study demonstrate that Light Gradient\nBoosting Machine (LightGBM) achieves the highest accuracy among\nmainstream machine learning models, with an accuracy rate of 69.2%\non the test set trained on embeddings. To address dimensionality-\nrelated challenges, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed\nto extract essential embeddings, with prediction performance\nevaluated across 2– 15 principal components. Alongside PCA, we\ncompared 31 alternative methods, including t-SNE, UMAP, and raw\ndata. Detailed comparisons, training procedures, and results are pro-\nvided in Table2, Supplementary Table 5, andthe supplementary notes.\nLightGBM, CatBoost, and RandomForest achieve the accuracy of\n92.3% in the test set (12 out of 13 proteins are correctly labeled) with\n4, 6, and 8 principal components, respectively. We can see that\ncompared to training models directly with embeddings, extracting\nessential dimensions with PCA provides higher accuracies in predict-\ning trans-cleavage activity (Supplementary Table 5). However, this\nmodel is still limited by the small dataset, more experimental data\nwould improve its prediction accuracy. Additionally, we tested our\nprediction model on two unreported Cas12a proteins, i.e., thetrans-\ncleavage activity of two Cas12a candidates: ArCas12a_1 (derived\nfrom Agathobacter rectale) and LeCas12a_3 (derived fromLachnospira\neligens_B). Our model predicted that ArCas12a_1 hastrans-cleavage\nactivity but not LeCas12a_3. In the experiment, ArCas12a_1\ndemonstrated signiﬁcantly strongertrans-cleavage activity than the\nnegative control, while LeCas12a_3 did not (Supplementary Fig. 4).\nThese experimental outcomes were consistent with our model’s pre-\ndictions, supporting the generalizability and robustness of the pre-\ndiction model.\nCRISPR-Cas12a loci predicted from the metagenomics\nWe did further feature analyses of Cas12a candidate proteins. Phylo-\ngenetic analysis of Cas12 proteins suggests that the identiﬁed Cas12a\nproteins fall into the Cas12a clade (Fig.2a). The classical CRISPR-loci,\ncomprising essential elements such as Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4, play a\npivotal role in type classiﬁcation. To delve into these features, we\nemployed AIL-Scan to predict Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4 proteins within the\nsame CRISPR loci adjacent to the Cas12a sequence. Subsequently, we\nmeticulously veriﬁed 300 predicted CRISPR loci to gain deeper\ninsights manually. Normally, Cas12a is considered to have a unique\nCRISPR locus, comprising Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4. Intriguingly, the\nobserved count of Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4 proteins was notably lower\nthan that of Cas12a, suggesting the absence of these small Cas proteins\nin some Cas12a loci (Fig.2b, c). Further stratiﬁcation based on the\nnumber of integrase proteins led to the classiﬁcation of CRISPR loci\ninto eight distinct subtypes. The distribution of integrase proteins\nacross these subtypes exhibited a sparse pattern (Fig.2d). Notably,\nsubtype VIII lacked any integrase proteins, subtype I encompassed\nCas1, Cas2, and Cas4, while subtype VI exclusively featured Cas2. This\nnuanced classiﬁcation sheds light on the diversity within CRISPR loci\nand underscores the intricate variations in the composition of inte-\ngrase proteins among different subtypes. Our observations may pro-\nvide unreported perspectives on correlations among different CRISPR-\nCas systems and integrase proteins. Remarkably, the analyses using\nthe 1000 predicted CRISPR Cas12a loci without manual veriﬁcation\nshow a strikingly similar distribution pattern as the result from the 300\nmanually conﬁrmed ones, indicating this distribution is a universal\nphenomenon (Supplementary Fig. 5). To provide further insights, we\nmeasured the length of CRISPR loci, beginning from the start of the\nCas12 protein and concluding at theﬁrst spacer. Subtype VIII emerged\nas the shortest, spanning mere 4200 bp, while subtype I is the longest,\nextending over 6100 bp. Particularly noteworthy were certain subtype\nI CRISPR loci exhibiting extraordinary lengths of up to 6700 bp, raising\nthe possibility of harboring enigmatic protein elements (Fig.2e).\nAligned with the integrase variation, the numbers of spacers notably\ndecreased in subtypes IV, VI, and VIII, underscoring the pivotal roles of\nintegrases in spacer capture (Fig.2f). Despite the divergence in spacer\nnumbers, the stem-loop region corresponding to direct repeat\nsequences remained conserved (Fig.2g). This consistent conservation\nhints at a shared structural element, emphasizing the importance of\nthe stem-loop region in CRISPR loci across different subtypes.\nTo explore the distribution of the discovered proteins in the\norganisms, we constructed a phylogenetic tree using 300 candidate\nTable 2 | Cas12a proteintrans-cleavage activity prediction\naccuracy using different strategies\nBest model + covariates Accuracy in test set\nLightGBM [1] + embeddings 69.2%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-2 69.2%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-3 84.6%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-4 92.3%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-5 84.6%\nLightGBM [1] + PCA-6 92.3%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-7 76.9%\nRandomForest [3] + PCA-8 92.3%\nNeural Network [4] + PCA-9 84.6%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-10 76.9%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-11 84.6%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-12 69.2%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-13 69.2%\nCatBoost [2] + PCA-14 84.6%\nNeural Network [4] + PCA-15 69.2%\nTable 1 | Cas protein prediction accuracy using\ndifferent models\n650 million\nESM\n15 billion\nESM\nCasIdentiﬁer\nHMM + ML\nHMMCAS\nHMM\nCASPredict\nSVM\nCas1 98.5% 98.5% 99.5% 97.4% 70.8%\nCas2 96.3% 99.4% 96.9% 94.4% 73.8%\nCas3 98.1% 98.7% 98.1% 97.7% 66.3%\nCas4 89.9% 94.4% 92.1% 96.6% 65.2%\nCas5 97.7% 98.5% 93.1% 82.3% 61.5%\nCas6 99.0% 98.7% 99.4% 98.1% 61.5%\nCas7 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 95.5% 77.3%\nCas8 88.9% 100.0% 100.0% 88.9% 77.8%\nCas9 100.0% 100.0% 98.7% 99.3% 91.4%\nCas10 99.6% 99.6% 99.2% 99.6% 82.3%\nCas12 100.0% 100.0% 97.4% 39.5% 76.3%\nCas13 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% N.A. 93.3%\nNon-Cas 99.8% 99.9% 96.5% N.A. 75.2%\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63160-4\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:7877 4\nCas12a proteins, which were manually veriﬁed, along with three\nknown Cas12a (LbCas12a, FnCas12a, and AsCas12a). 232 Cas12a pro-\nteins from theLachnospiraceaefamily cluster into one clade.

Additionally, the thermostable\nYmeCas12a (subtype I) is adjacent to subtype I Cas12a proteins\n(Supplementary Fig. 6).\nCRISPR arrayCas12a Cas4Cas1 Cas2\nsubtype I\nsubtype II\nsubtype III\nsubtype IV\nsubtype V\nsubtype VI\nsubtype VII\nsubtype VIII\n187 142 \n219 \n283 234 250 133 136 \n209 \n118 179 \n141 \n116 \n293\n130 \n195 \n146 \n188 \n156 \n196 \n233 \n231\n215 \n244 \n294 \n264 \n299 \n290 \n284 \n246 \n248 \n240 \n229 \n278 \n177 \n279 \n252 \n175 \n145 \n291 \n298 \n137 \n95 \n131\n148 \n158 \n91 \n88 \n110 \n97 \n119 \n194 \n114 \n89 \n115 \n105\n \n94 \n193 \n150 \n149 12\n0 \n282 \n281\n \n189\n178 \n210 \n19\n7 \n26\n5 \n138 21\n2 \n147 \n128\n253222 \n152 129 \n271 \n245 \n171 \n184 122\n \n190\n \n14\n4 \n192 \n106 \n135 \n90 \n99 \n143 \n151 \n272 \n300 \n153 \n592\n112\n732\n38\n321 157 \n155 \n182 \n255 \n181\n \n275\n \n243 \n154 \n297 \n12\n1 \n236 \n139\n235 \n241 \n28\n9 \n207 \n13\n2 \n280 \n183 \n268 \n117 \n276 \n254\n \n218 \n191\n \n101 \n104\n \n13\n4 \n125\n \n124 \n220 \n262\n \n217 \n238 \n251 285 \n270 \n228 \n213 \n263 \n198 \n221 \n180 \n239 \n249 \n186 \n126 \n232 \n274 \n174 \n176 \n185 \n296 \n127 \n140 \n269 \n273 \n25 \n3 \n2 \n4 \n111 \n63 \n62 \n61\n60 \n59 \n58 \n7 \n6 \n8 \n11 \n10 \n9 \n84 \n76 \n79 \n86 87 \n80 \n81 \n78 \n85 \n201 \n259 \n266 100 102 92 \n98 96 \n77 \n226 257 205\n277 223 163 260 292 216 204 199 203 208 159 160 261 167 224 258 93 200 247 173 21\n4 166 161 242 82 227\n 256\n \n206 26\n7 \n16\n9 172 16\n2 20\n2 16\n4 \n168 \n165\n \n17\n0 288 230 \n66 68 70 \n69 67 65 73 \n75 20 19 64 \nAsCas12a\n56 \nFnCas12\n40 37\n \n38 9314\n5552 \n47 \n46 \n45 54\n \n28\n7 36\n \n51\n \n35\n \n34 \n53 \n286 \n112 103 \n109\n 50 49\n 43\n 44 484226 29\n 28 27 16 15 17 \nLb\nCas12a1213 108\n 113\n 141 23 22 24 18 5 74 225 107 71 72 33 \n32 3031 21 57 \n1\nsubclade 1\nsubcla\nde 2\nsubclade 3\nCas12a classification\nsubtype I\nsubtype II\nsubtype III\nsubtype IV\nsubtype V\nsubtype VI\nsubtype VII\nsubtype VIII\nFamily name\nLachnospiraceae\nAcutalibacteraceae\nTreponemataceae\nBacteroidaceae\nSuccinivibrionaceae\nMegasphaeraceae\nP3\nRikenellaceae\nMuribaculaceae\nPaludibacteraceae\nErysipelatoclostridiaceae\nCAG-917\nAnaerovoracaceae\nUBA932\nab\ncde\nfg\nh\n1\nCas12c\nCas12L\nCas12k\nCas12j\nCas12n\nCas12m\nCas12f Cas12g\nCas12b\nCas12i\nCas12a2\nCas12h Cas12d\nCas12λ\nCas12e\nCas12a\nidentified Cas12a\nbootstrap\n0.8\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95\n1\n0\n1\n2bits\n5′\n1\n2\nG\n3G\nA\n4\nT\nA\nG\n5\nT\nG\n6\nC\nG\nT\n7C\nT\n8\nG\nT\nA\n9\nC\nA\n10\nT\nA\nG\n11\nG\nA\nT\n12\nG\nC\nA\n13\nG\nT\nC\nA\n14\nA\nC\nT\n15\nT\nG\nC\nA\n16\nA\nC\nT\n17\nC\nTA\n18\nT\nA\nG\n19\nC\nT\nA\n20\nT\nG\nA\n21\nG\nA\nT\n22\nA\n23\nA\n24\nT\n25\nT\n26\nT\n27\nA\nC\n28\nT\n29\nA\n30\nC\n31\nT\n32\nA\nT\nG\n33\nG\nT\n34\nT\nG\n35\nC\nT\n36\nG\n37\nT\n38\nA\n39\nA\nG\n40\nA\n41\nTC\nT\nA\n3′\nStem loop\nsu\nbtype\nVII\nI\nsu\nbtype\nVII\nsubtype V\nI\nsubtyp\neV\nsu\nbtypeIV\nsubtyp\neIII\nsubtype I\nI\nsubt\nyp\neI\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\nLength of CRISPR loci\nP = 1.14x10-73\nP =3 . 6 5 x 1 0-100\nP =2 .37x10-52\nP =1 . 0 1 x 1 0-11\nP =2 . 3 7 x 1 0-52\nCas12Cas1Cas2Cas4\n0\n100\n200\n300\nCounts\n0 50 100 150\nsubtype VIII\nsubtype VII\nsubtype VI\nsubtype V\nsubtype IV\nsubtype III\nsubtype II\nsubtype I\nCounts\nsubtyp\neI\nsubt\nyp\neII\nsub\ntype\nIII\nsub\ntype\nIV\nsu\nbtypeV\nsubtype\nVI\nsubtype\nVII\nsubt\nyp\neV I\nII\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n#\nP = 1.19 x10-13\nP = 0.1306\nP = 8.35 x10-11\nP = 2.62 x10-14\nP = 0.1051\n#\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63160-4\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:7877 5\nCas integrases in CRISPR loci\nNew insights highlight the structural diversity and functional roles of\nCas integrases in CRISPR loci23– 27. Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4 are essential for\nintegrating foreign DNA into bacterial CRISPR systems, which gen-\nerates bacterial immunity\n26. AlphaFold228 was applied to predict all\nprotein structures in the eight distinct subtypes, providing insights\ninto their variation, respectively (Fig.3 and Supplementary Fig. 7). Cas1\nproteins, encompassing 92– 331 amino acids, are classiﬁed into eight\ntypes based on structure and sequence (Fig.3a, b and Supplementary\nFig. 7b). Type 8 is the most prevalent Cas1 protein, resembling AfCas1\n(PDB: 4N06)\n29 and its N-terminal and C-terminal domains (NTD, CTD)\ncontain with key catalytic sites in speciﬁc helices and loops (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 7c). Structural differences across types were analyzed via\nthe Dali server\n30. The variation in CTD elements does not necessarily\nhinder foreign DNA acquisition31, emphasizing their structuralﬂex-\nibility. Cas2 proteins, containing 70– 146 amino acids, also fall into\neight subtypes, with type 8 showing notable structural similarities toE.\ncoli Cas2 (PDB: 5DQT)32 but with unique N-terminal helices (Fig.3c, d\nand Supplementary Fig. 7d– f). Other subtypes exhibit varied structural\ndeﬁciencies, such as missing β-sheets or helices, affecting dimer\ninterfaces and potentially altering DNA binding. This diversity under-\nlines Cas2’s adaptability within Cas1– Cas2 complexes (Supplementary\nFig. 7f)\n33. Cas4 proteins, comprising 79– 206 amino acids, exhibit eight\ntypes (Fig.3e, f and Supplementary Fig. 7g, h), with type 8 resembling\nI-C Cas4 (PDB: 8D3Q)24 but lacking speciﬁc helices critical for proto-\nspacer cleavage. Structural differences across subtypes, such as miss-\ning helices orβ-sheets, impact spacer insertion and integration within\nCRISPR systems (Supplementary Fig. 7i). Theseﬁndings broaden our\nunderstanding of Cas4 structural variations and their functional\nimplications in bacterial immunity. The detailed structural features of\nintegrases are analyzed in the Supplementary Note.\nCas12a proteins in the subtypes\nThe differences in the Cas12a structures are key features of the Cas12a\nsubtypes. We analyzed the motifs of the Cas12a sequences and dis-\ncovered conserved and distinct motifs in the different subtypes, which\nare key for the Cas12a functions (Supplementary Fig. 8). The analysis\nrevealed that the catalytic residues within the RuvC and Nuc domains\nare highly conserved among all subtypes, reﬂecting their critical roles\nin enzymatic function. Speciﬁcally, theﬁrst catalytic aspartate in the\ntriad resides within the conserved motif IGIFRGEERN. The second\ncatalytic glutamate displays subtype-speciﬁc distributions, appearing\nas MED in subtypes I, IV, V, and VI, as M/LEN/D in subtype II, and as\nMEK/D in subtype VIII. The third catalytic aspartate is consistently\nlocated in the motif DADANG, speciﬁcally at the second“D”. Addi-\ntionally, a highly conserved TSKIDP motif was identiﬁed across all\nsubtypes, indicating a shared functional mechanism. Other conserved\nmotifs showed variability among subtypes, suggesting distinct\nsequence characteristics while maintaining overall catalytic and\nstructural integrity. We also built the structure models of 300 Cas12a\nproteins using AlphaFold2, except for the failed construction, and\ncalculated the root mean squareﬂuctuation (RMSF) for all candidate\nCas12a proteins within one subtype (Supplementary Fig. 9). The\ndetailed analyses are appended in the Supplementary Notes. The RMSF\nreﬂects the residue-wise structural difference within one subtype. The\nresults suggested that, despite an overall conserved structural archi-\ntecture, speciﬁc regions within the proteins exhibit variability that may\nreﬂect structural adaptations speciﬁct oe a c hs u b t y p e .\nCas12a proteins have distinctcis-a n dtrans-cleavage activities\nCas12a processes the pre-crRNA transcripts into mature crRNA by its\nendoribonuclease activity. Then the Cas12a– crRNA complex efﬁciently\ncis-cleaves a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which is initiated by a\nPAM motif recognition. The cleaved DNA segment that remains bound\nthen induces non-speci ﬁc degradation of single-strand DNA\n(ssDNA) (Fig.4a).\nTherefore, we evaluated the RNA binding efﬁciency, DNA binding\nefﬁciency, cis-a n dtrans-acting DNase activities of sixteen Cas12a\nproteins from eight subtypes derive from Anaeroglobus micro-\nnuciformis (AmCas12a), Eubacterium_G ventriosum (EvCas12a_1 and\nEvCas12a_2), Erysipelatoclostridium sp. (EspCas12a), Ruminococcus_E\nsp. (RspCas12a_1 and RspCas12a_2),Agathobacter rectale(ArCas12a),\nLachnospira eligens(LeCas12a_1 and LeCas12a_2),UBA3388 sp.( U B A -\nCas12a),RC9 sp. (RCCas12a),CAG-127 sp. (CAGCas12a),Ruminococcus_E\nbromii_B (RbrCas12a_1, RbrCas12a_2, RbrCas12a_3 and RbrCas12a_4)\n(Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 6). Remark-\nably, the direct repeat sequence of these candidate Cas12a proteins is\nconserved alongside their celebrated counterparts, i.e., LbCas12a\n(Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 11). Therefore, we chose LbCas12a as\nthe positive control in the following assays, as well as its crRNA scaffold\nin the screening step. All the Cas12a proteins show RNA and DNA\nbinding ability as expected (Fig.4b, c, Supplementary Fig. 10c, d, and\nSupplementary Table 7). However, the DNA binding ability of subtype I\nand subtype VIII are higher than other Cas12a proteins. According to\nthe inherenttrans-DNase activity of Cas12a, as well as the 4 bp PAM\nlength, we developed a simple and efﬁcient PAM detection method.\nWe constructed 6 short dsDNA target arrays by annealing 256 kinds of\nPAM sequence primer pairs in each well, which targetEMX1 site1,\nDNMT1 site1, FANCF site1, MERS site1, eGFP site1, and eGFP site 3\n(Supplementary Table 8). Each dsDNA target was incubated with can-\ndidate Cas12a proteins, crRNA and FAM-BHQ reporter to detect\nﬂuorescence of each reaction system (Fig.4d). Using this assay, we\ndetermined the PAM preference of EvCas12a_2, AmCas12a,\nRspCas12a_2, CAGCas12a and RbrCAS12a_1, EcCas12_2, RspCas12a_2,\nand CAGCas12a recognize T rich PAM, but AmCas12a prefer G-start\nPAM, RbrCas12a_1 recognize 5-GTV-3 PAM (Fig.4e– i and Supplemen-\ntary Figs. 11, 12).\nTo corroborate thecis-acting DNase activity of candidate Cas12a\nproteins, we incubated Cas12a proteins with a crRNA and a linearized\nplasmid dsDNA. All linearized dsDNA were degraded by candidate\nCas12a proteins with comparable efﬁciency to LbCas12a at 37 °C, with\nthe exception of RCCas12a (Fig.5a and Supplementary Fig 13a). Sanger\nsequencing of the cleaved DNA ends revealed that AmCas12a intro-\nduced INDELs at 18 in NTS and 23 in TS, consistent with other Cas12a\northologs (Supplementary Fig. 13e, f). However, most Cas12a variants\nexhibited diminished DNase activity, resulting in the production of\nuncleaved DNA at room temperature (RT), except for subtype VIII\nCas12a proteins, which lack integrases. (Fig.5b and Supplementary\nFig. 13b). Subtype II Cas12a variants are slightly less active than\nLbCas12a in single-strand (ssDNA) degradation, while EspCas12a,\nFig. 2 | Cas12a subtypes discovered from metagenomic data. aPhylogenetic tree\nof Cas12 proteins.

In\ncontrast, the other Cas12a variants displayed notably lower activity\n(Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 13c). Most of these Cas12a proteins\nrepresent considerablecis cleavage activity but are a bit different in\ntrans-cleavage activity compared to LbCas12a.

Relative to\nLbCas12a and FnCas12a, the REC1 domain of AmCas12a presents a\ndeviation of 7.3° and 9.4°, respectively. Simultaneously, the REC2\ndomain of AmCas12a manifests a rotational disparity of 4.8° and 6.2°,\nrespectively (Supplementary Fig. 17d, e).\nAs observed in the LbCas12a and FnCas12a crRNA binary struc-\ntures, the repeat-derived pseudoknot in the 5’ handle of the crRNA is\nordered. However, the crRNA conformation is markedly different from\nthat of the crRNA bound by LbCas12a or FnCas12a. Due to theﬂexibility\nof the spacer-derived part of crRNA, it’s almost unclear in the\nCas12a– crRNA binary complex\n35,36. Notably, an extra RNA stem formed\nby A(1)– A(5) and U(18)– U(22) within the crRNA spacer region makes a\npart of spacer region including seed sequence well-deﬁned in the\ncentral cavity of AmCas12a and adopt an A-form-like helical con-\nformation, but A(−10)– G(−6) and G(6)– A(15) nucleotides of crRNA are\nunclear (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 18). To accommodate the\ndouble RNA stem substrate, the REC lobe of AmCas12a rotates away\nfrom the NUC lobe. Unsurprisingly, the docking of crRNA to Alphafold-\ngenerated AmCas12a causes a severe clash in the REC domain (Sup-\nplementary Fig. 15c). The attainment of conformational integrity\nwithin the extra RNA stem is orchestrated by intricate interplays\ninvolving the ribose and phosphate moieties of the crRNA backbone,\nengaging in multiple interactions with speciﬁc residues within the\nWED, REC1, and RuvC domains of AmCas12a (Fig.6e). These include\nresidues T19, H751, K522, and H861 from the WED domain, Y50 and\nR168 from the REC1 domain and Q1003 from the RuvC domain, all of\nwhich are conserved with Cas12a orthologs, except Q1003 which form\nah y d r o g e nb o n dw i t ht h ep h o s p h a t eo fU ( 1 8 )( S u p p l e m e n t a r yF i g .1 8 ) .\nDistinct from the FnCas12– crRNA complex, the spacer segment of\ncrRNA major interacts with the WED domain of AmCas12a.\nCompared to the LbCas12a– crRNA complex and FnCas12a– crRNA\ncomplex, the divalent Mg ions are in the same location (Supplementary\nFig. 17a– c). Consistent with a seed sequence-dependent mechanism of\nDNA targeting and in broad agreement with previous analyses of\nAsCas12a, LbCas12a activities in vivo, and FnCas12a activities\nin vitro\n35,37,38, cleavage of DNA substrates with single-nucleotide mis-\nmatches in the seed segment was almost completely impaired, while\nmismatches in the PAM-distal region of the DNA target were mostly\ntolerated (Fig.6g).\nSpeciﬁc detection of single-nucleotide mutation by AmCas12a\nCas12a is a promising tool in the next-generation molecule diagnosis,\nhowever, it suffers from the PAM limitation39. The oncogene SNP only\nhas a small sequence window to probe, the traditional PAM, TTTV,\ncould not cover all the SNPs. Therefore, we tested whether the\nAmCas12a can distinguish the SNPs without a traditional PAM. (Fig.7a)\nT h eo n c o g e n em u t a n t s ,KRAS c.34 G > T (G12C), did not contain the\navailable TTTV in the adjacent sequences (Fig.7b). Among the Cas12a\nproteins that have undergone PAM preference testing, AmCas12a,\nEvCas12a_2, CAGGCas12a, and RbrCas12a_1 showed potential for\nrecognizing the G12C mutation. The results revealed that AmCas12a\nexhibited the best performance (Supplementary Fig. 20). We designed\nthe crRNA targeting the SNP (Fig.7b). According to theﬂuorescence\nintensity, we selected the crRNAs inducing the strongest signals, i.e.,\ncrRNA 1 for theKRAS mutant (Fig.7c). The AmCas12a can detect ten\ncopies of theKRASmutant (Fig.7d). Furthermore, we diluted the target\nmutant and evaluated the sensitivity of detection. The AmCas12a can\neven distinguish 0.1%KRAS mutant in the wild-type gene background,\nwhich is more sensitive than the Sanger sequencing (Fig.7e, f).\nDiscussion\nCRISPR-Cas system keeps evolving during the arms race between\nbacteria and phages. The proteins gain or lose function via mutation or\ndomain reorganization, accordingly, the accessory proteins such as\nintegrases Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4 change in the CRISPR loci. Therefore,\ntracing the Cas protein sequences in the CRISPR loci provides a prac-\ntical strategy to decipher the evolution of the CRISPR-Cas system.\nHowever, this process is complex due to the diversity and the huge\ndata from metagenomics. In this work, the AIL-Scan model leveraged\nt h ec a p a b i l i t yo fE S M - 2i nr e s i d u er e s o l u t i o np r e d i c t i o nf o rt h eC R I S P R -\nCas identiﬁcation.

(Table1) The small\nCas proteins, e.g., Cas1, Cas2, Cas3, Cas4, Cas5, and Cas8, are difﬁcult\nto predict, as shown by the relatively low prediction accuracy (Table1),\nbecause the short sequences provide too limited information to\naccurately predict. The highly accurate model can extract more pre-\ncise information from short sequences. When we increase the size of\nthe model, we observe a signiﬁcant increase in the prediction accuracy\nfor the small Cas proteins. The superior capability of the large model\nalso contributed to the precise prediction of the non-Cas proteins\n(Table 1). However, considering resource consumption, the 650 M\nmodel can practically handle the Cas protein classiﬁcation.\nThe interpretability of the large language model is crucial for\nunderstanding the principles of prediction and the underlying biolo-\ngical mechanisms. However, the vectors produced by ESM-2 are\nabstract and highly processed, which limits their interpretability. To\naddress this, we explored the interpretability of the model through the\nattention mechanisms in ESM. Inspired by studies of protein structure,\nwe successfully extracted attention scores of LbCas12a from the 20\nheads of the ESM-2 model and analyzed their correlation with struc-\ntural domains (Supplementary Table 11). The results showed that\nattention in the cleavage domains was 2- to 24-fold higher than in the\nnon-cleavage domains across all heads. This indicates that the model\nprimarily focused attention on the cleavage domains of Cas12a, which\nare critical for protein function. The analyses of AsCas12a and SpCas9\nrevealed similar results (Supplementary Table 11), indicating that the\ncleavage domains are the key to distinguishing different Cas proteins.\nFurthermore, we observed signiﬁcant correlated attention between\ncleavage and cleavage domains, which indicates the structural atten-\ntion between domains in the ESM-2 (Supplementary Fig. 21). These\nresults demonstrated that the ESM-2 model concentrated attention on\nthe cleavage domains, emphasizing their importance in protein func-\ntion and underscoring the interpretability of the model’s predictions.\nHowever, this model still has certain limitations, including\ndependence on training data, high computational resource require-\nments, limited ability to capture complex biophysical properties and\nrare features (e.g.,trans-cleavage activity), and sensitivity to sequence\nvariations in speciﬁc protein families. Additionally, the model’si n t e r -\npretability, efﬁciency, and the management of imbalanced data still\nrequire improvement. Nevertheless, this model has laid an important\nfoundation for advancing protein characterization and structure pre-\ndiction. Therefore, it is both necessary and reasonable to extend the\nmodel’s ability to capture speciﬁc sequences based on large models,\nsuch as our work ontrans-cleavage activity prediction. This model\ncould serve as a platform for further development and extension.\nGiven the absence of universalcas genes and the frequent mod-\nular recombination, CRISPR-Cas classiﬁcation requires multipronged\nparameters, including the signaturecas genes, sequence similarity\nbetween the shared Cas proteins, and the organization of the genes in\nthe CRISPR-Cas loci\n40,41. The Cas12a proteins are well-characterized Cas\nproteins, normally containing three integrases, i.e., Cas1, Cas2, and\nCas4. Paradoxically, we discovered 7 unreported subtypes with dis-\ntinct integrase combinations in the metagenomic data (Fig.2). We\naligned the Cas12a protein sequences and integrated them with the\ninformation of subtypes and species. Remarkably, even in the same\nbacterial family, such asLachnospiraccaeand Acutalibacteraccae,t h e\nvariants are diverse. The Cas12a proteins in theLachnospireaccae\nfamily share high similarities, but the CRISPR-loci are mainly domi-\nn a t e db ys u b t y p eI( 4 0 . 7 % )a n df o l l o w e db ys u b t y p eV I( 3 5 . 9 % ) .\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63160-4\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:7877 11\nInterestingly, most CRISPR-Cas12a proteins in theAcutalibacteraccae\nfamily do not contain any integrases, only 11.8% belong to subtype 2.\nCas1, Cas2, and Cas4 are located downstream of Cas12 in a tandem\npattern. The Cas1– Cas2 complex is necessary for the site-selective\nCRISPR array expansion during the initial step of bacterial adaptive\nimmunity\n26. Cas4 is an endonuclease that deﬁnes the PAM and assists\nin the insertion of the spacer into the CRISPR array unidirectionally25,42.\nMany CRISPR-Cas systems lack Cas4, and some hosts use alternative\nexonucleases to acquire new CRISPR immune sequences\n23.A l t e r -\nnatively, parts of hosts encode a solo-Cas4 outside the CRISPR-Cas\nloci43, but due to the incompleteness of the metagenomics, we could\nnot exclude this possibility in the current study. In the evolution sys-\ntem, loss-of-function in certain components will drive the gain-of-\nfunction in other components to keep the robustness of the whole\nsystem. Integrase-deﬁcient Cas12a variants can all achieve dsDNA\ndegradation, (Fig.5a, b and Supplementary Fig. 13a, b). However, it\nremains unclear whether the absence of either ancillary integrase\nnecessitates alternative genes in the genome, collaboration with inte-\ngrases from other CRISPR-Cas systems, loss of function in immuno-\nlogical memory acquisition, or gain of function in Cas12a proteins.\nFig. 7 | AmCas12a detection of KRAS mutants. aScheme of single-nucleotide\nmutant detection by Cas12a.b Synthetic crRNA for single-nucleotideKRAS muta-\ntion based on the PAM preference of AmCas12a.

They\ncan bind to the crRNA and DNA but with different afﬁnities (Fig.4b, c).\nAll the Cas12a variants cleave the dsDNA in a temperature-dependent\nmanner. Divalent metal ions play key roles in the cleavage and con-\nformational rearrangements of CRISPR– Cas12a\n44.D e s p i t eM g2+ ions,\nMn2+ is able to activate some Cas12a34,45. EvCas12a_2, AmCas12a,\nRspCas12a_2, RbrCas12a_1, and CAGCas12a prefer Mn2+ in the ssDNA\ncleavage. In addition, Co2+ can activate RspCas12a_2 better than Mg2+\n(Fig.5d). The ssDNA cleavage by Cas12a has been successfully applied in\nnucleic acid detection46,47. Nevertheless, Cas12a proteins are restrained\nby the PAM sequence48, therefore, Cas12a with different PAM pre-\nferences are required. In our work, we have systematically evaluated the\nPAM preference of the Cas12a proteins (Fig.4). We found that AmCas12a\nrecognizes a broader PAM. We took the SNP of the oncogeneKRAS as\nthe target, which can not be detected by the traditional Cas12a due to the\nlack of PAM sequences near the mutation site. After optimization, the\nAmCas12a can speciﬁcally distinguish theKRAS G12C mutations, but\nLbCas12a can not. Theseﬁndings extend the toolbox of Cas12a detec-\ntion. Although the Cas proteins demonstrate great potential in biological\nand medical applications, the potential misuse of CRISPR technology\nposes signiﬁcant ethical, security, and ecological challenges. In addition,\nthe risks of off-target effects and unintended genetic changes compli-\ncate the ethical considerations, particularly regarding human germline\nediting. Ensuring proper use of CRISPR requires more precise gene\nediting tools, stringent regulatory frameworks, and ethical guidelines.\nThe structure of crRNA is key to the conformational change of\nCas12a. The stem-loop region and seed region are stable, but the\nspacer region in an apo form is largely elusive. Our cryo-EM structure\ndiscovered an undocumented folding of the crRNA spacer region,\nwhich forms a stem (Fig.6b). This structure demonstrates the struc-\ntural tolerance of the AmCas12a for crRNAﬂexibility. In the crRNA\nbinary complex, Cas12a interacts with the pseudoknot of crRNA with\nconserved residues. However, due to the extra RNA stem, AmCas12a\ninteracts with the spacer region by the WED domain instead of the\nREC1 and WED domains.\nIn summary, we developed an artiﬁcial intelligence language\nmodel for Cas protein prediction. The increasing parameters in large\ndata models can enhance the accuracy of predicting Cas proteins,\nespecially for short protein sequences. This feature contributes to the\nundocumented CRISPR loci discovery and analyses of Cas protein\nevolution. Importantly, some Cas12 proteins have broader PAM\nrecognition patterns and can be developed into efﬁcient genome\neditors in mammalian cells or speciﬁc SNP detection kits. Theseﬁnd-\nings will substantially increase the diversity of CRISPR-Cas12a systems\nand largely expand the programmable DNA-editing toolbox. This\nstudy shows the great potential of the language model with tre-\nm e n d o u sp a r a m e t e r si np r o t e i nf u n ction exploration. Our study pro-\nvides new insights into machine learning on the natural evolution of\nthe CRISPR system, and a detailed characterization will discover more\nvaluable gene editing tools.\nMethods\nTraining data for language models\nWe generated sequences from NCBI databases to train ESM-2 650\nmillion and 15 billion language models. Weﬁrst used the keyword\n‘CRISPR-associated protein’ to download all the gene IDs and then\nanalyzed the annotation‘gene’ with ‘cas’. We further removed redun-\ndant sequences. We ﬁnally collected 13047 non-Cas proteins and\n76567 Cas protein sequences, including 11248 Cas1, 15148 Cas2, 12309\nCas3, 7708 Cas4, 8656 Cas5, 11330 Cas6, 340 Cas7, 299 Cas8, 6706\nCas9, 2282 Cas10, 334 Cas12, and 207 Cas13. We splited these\nsequences into two datasets, 80% as training data and 20% as\nvalidation data. The preparation details are listed in the\nSupplementary Notes.\nTraining ESM language models\nWe performed ﬁne-tuning on the open-source sequence classiﬁer\nprovided by ESM to adapt it to our application. The model consists of\ntwo fully connected layers, which are speciﬁcally designed for classi-\nﬁcation tasks. In theﬁrst layer of the model, the fully connected layer\napplies a linear transformation to the output features of the ESM\nmodel, mapping them to the same dimensional space, followed by a\nhyperbolic tangent (Tanh) activation function to introduce non-\nlinearity. The second fully connected layer then projects the pro-\ncessed features to the dimension of target classes. This model struc-\nture effectively combines the excellent feature extraction ability of\nESM and the efﬁcient classiﬁcation performance of fully connected\nneural networks, achieving effective classiﬁcation of sequences. This\nmodel design maintains the high-dimensional sequence features while\neffectively learning the classiﬁcation task.\nTo further improve training efﬁciency and model performance,\nwe employ the Accelerate\n49 and Deepspeed50 training acceleration\nframework, particularly its ZeRO Stage51 ofﬂoad feature, to optimize\nmemory utilization and accelerate the training process. AdamW is\nemployed as the optimizer for its weight decay and momentum fea-\nture to enhance the training stability and efﬁciency. Meanwhile, War-\nmupLR is adopted as the learning rate scheduler, which gradually\nincreases the learning rate in the early stages of training to facilitate\nmodel convergence. FocalLoss is used as the training loss function,\nwhich adjusts the weights of positive and negative samples to mitigate\nthe class imbalance problem. The details were described in the sup-\nplementary methods. The hyperparameter‘α‘ of FocalLoss is deter-\nmined by considering the ratio of class sizes in the Cas data. We have\ntried different learning rates and batch size combinations, i.e., learning\nrate 0.00001 with batch size 64, learning rate 0.001 with batch size 32,\nand learning rate 0.001 with batch size 64, separately. The best para-\nmeter is a learning rate of 0.00001 with a batch size of 64. We trained\nmultiple epochs and chose the best one for theﬁnal prediction (Sup-\nplementary Fig. 22). The model architecture and training are imple-\nmented in PyTorch, ensuring code modernity and efﬁciency. The\ntraining was conducted on the Zhejiang Lab Alkaid Intelligent Com-\nputing Operating System using NVIDIA Volta A100 GPUs for the 15B\nmodel and V100 for the 650 M model.\nProtein expression and puriﬁcation\nThe candidate discovered Cas12a was expressed and puriﬁed as pre-\nviously described52. In brief, the coding sequences of Cas proteins were\ncodon-optimized and synthesized by Tsingke Biotech (China) and then\ncloned into pET28a (Novagen) with a C-terminal 10× His tag. The\npET28a-Cas12a plasmid was transformed intoE. coli Rosetta and\ninduced with 0.2 mM IPTG for 16 h at 18 °C before cell harvesting. After\ncell pellet lysis, the Cas12a protein was puriﬁed using a Ni-NTA resin\ncolumn and a Heparin Sepharose column according to the manu-\nfacturer’s instructions (GE Healthcare). Then the puriﬁed Cas12a pro-\ntein was concentrated in storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,\n500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM DTT), quantiﬁed using the\nabsorption at 280 nm, and frozen at−80 °C until use.\nNucleic acid preparation\nThe double-stranded DNA fragment of Cas12a variants was synthesized\nby Tsingke Biotech (China) and cloned into the pUC57 vector with a T7\nprimer. The crRNAs were synthesized by GenScript (Nanjing, China),\nand sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 7.\nCas12a-mediated nucleic acid detection\nThe detection assays were performed according to previously repor-\nted methods with minor modiﬁcations52.I na2 0 μl detection assay,\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63160-4\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:7877 13\nwith 200 ng Cas12a protein, 25 pM ssDNA FQ reporter, 50 nM crRNA,\nand 10 ng of target dsDNA in a reaction buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM\nTris-HCl, 100µg/mL BSA, pH 7.9) supplied with 10 mM MgCl\n2 or\nMnSO4, incubate at 37 °C until detection. A PerkinElmer EnSpire reader\nwith excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm was used forﬂuor-\nescence detection. For the divalent ion preference screen. The metal\nion preference assay was performed as previously described\n34. In brief,\nthe CRISPR-Cas12 detection assay was supplemented with 10 mM\nCaCl\n2,C o C l2,C u S O4,N i S O4,M g S O4,M n S O4,o rZ n S O4.\nIn vitro RNA and DNA binding assays\nFor RNA binding assays, Cas12a (100 nM) was incubated with Cy3-DNA\n(10 nM) at room temperature for 10 min in the reaction buffer. The\nreaction was quenched with glycerol loading buffer (10 mM Tris-\nHCl,pH 8.0, 10% glycerol). Reaction products were resolved by 12%\nPAGE and visualized by Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Health Care).\nFor DNA binding assays, Cas12a protein wasﬁrst complexed with\ncrRNA at a 1:2 ratio at room temperature for 10 min in the reaction\nbuffer. Cas12a complex (100 nM) was incubated with annealed FAM-\nDNA (25 nM) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was\nquenched with glycerol loading buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl,pH 8.0, 10%\nglycerol). Reaction products were resolved by 12% PAGE and visualized\nby Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Health Care).\nPAM preference assay\nThe six short dsDNA target arrays were constructed by annealing 256\ntypes of PAM sequence primer pairs in each well, which targetEMX1\nsite1, DNMT1 site1, FANCF site1, MERS site1, eGFP site1 andeGFP site 3\n(Supplementary Table 8), Next, same as nucleic acid detection, Cas12a\nprotein (200 ng), ssDNA FQ reporter (25 pM), crRNA (50 nM) and short\ntarget dsDNA (8.5 nM) were mixed in a reaction buffer supplied with\n10 mM MgCl\n2 (EvCas12a_2 and RspCas12a_2) or MnSO4 (AmCas12a,\nCAGCas12a and RbrCas12a_1), and incubated at 37 °C, ViiA 7 Real-Time\nPCR system were used forﬂuorescence tracing. In each detection\nplate, triple repeats of dsDNA with TTTG PAM are used as the control\nfor intensity normalization.\nPhylogenetic analysis\nThe phylogenetic tree of Fig. 2a was constructed from a dataset of\n87 sequences, including 30 Cas9 proteins, 43 Cas12 proteins, and 14\nCas13 proteins. The tree of Fig.2h was constructed by 300 Cas12a\nvariants, as well as FnCas12a, LbCas12a, and AsCas12a. The sequences\nwere aligned with MAFFT-linsi (v7.480)\n53. A phylogenetic tree was\nconstructed by FastTree54 with default parameters. The phylogenetic\ntree is annotated by iTol55.\nTargeted deep sequencing\nHEK293T cells were from Cell Bank/Stem Cell Bank, Chinese Academy\nof Sciences, and cultured in Dulbecco’sm o d iﬁed Eagle’sm e d i u m\n(GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v) (Gemini) and 1%\npenicillin– streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For plasmid transfection,\ncells were in 24-well plates in three biological replicates and trans-\nfected with 1.2μg plasmids (including 900 ng editor and 300 ng\nsgRNA) per well, when cells reached an approximate 70-90% con-\nﬂuency. Transfections were carried out with the aid of EZ Trans (Life-\niLab; Cat. No.: AC04L091) reagent and according to the manufacturer’s\nprotocols. Three days after transfection, cells were harvested for deep\nsequencing. Target sites were ampliﬁed from extracted genomic DNA\nusing Phanta® Max Super-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Vazyme). PCR\nproducts with different barcodeswere pooled together for deep\nsequencing on the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform (2× 150 PE) by\nAnnoroad Gene Technology (Beijing, China). Different experimental\nconditions were differentiated by bar codes, and experimental repe-\ntitions were included in different pools. Sequencing reads were\ndemultiplexed using AdapterRemoval (version 2.2.2), and the pair-end\nreads with 11 bp or more alignments were combined into a single\nconsensus read. All processed reads were then mapped to the target\nsequences using the BWA-MEM algorithm (BWA v0.7.16). Indel fre-\nquency was calculated as: the number of indel-containing reads/total\nmapped reads. The targets and primers used in this study are provided\nin Supplementary Tables 9 and 12.\nReconstruction of AmCas12a–crRNA complex\nAmCas12a was expressed and puriﬁed as described above, but further\npuriﬁed by size exclusion column (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300, GE\nHealthcare) in SEC buffer 1 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl) for\ncomplex preparation. The sgRNA was diluted to 100μMi nr e f o l d i n g\nbuffer (50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl\n2) and refolded at 72 °C for 5 min. The\nAmCas12a– crRNA binary was reconstituted by incubating 25 μM\nAmCas12a and 30μM crRNA for 30 min at room temperature in a total\nvolume of 450μl assembly buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM\nNaCl, 10 mM MgCl2). Subsequently, the mixture was puriﬁed by size\nexclusion column in SEC buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM\nNaCl, 1 mM MgCl\n2). The puriﬁed aliquots were concentrated to 2 mg/\nmL, ﬂash frozen, and stocked at−80 °C.\nCryo-EM sample preparation and data collection\nSample vitriﬁcation was performed using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo\nFisher) operating at 4 °C and 100% humidity. A 4μl sample was applied\nto a holey amorphous nickel– titanium alloy foil (ANTA foil 1.2/1.3) that\nhad been glow-discharged for 30 s. The grids were blotted for 4 s at a\n‘blot force’of −2 by standard Vitrobotﬁlter paper (Ted Pella) and were\nthen plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. Cryo-EM data were collected on a\nTitan Krios electron microscope operated at 300 kV equipped with\nand Falcon4 direct electron detector with a Quantum energyﬁlter\nusing EPU. Micrographs were recorded in counting mode at a nominal\nmagniﬁcation of 165,000×, resulting in a physical pixel size of 0.74 Å\nper pixel. The defocus was set between−0.6 μma n d−1.8 μm. The total\nexposure time of each movie stack led to a total accumulated dose of\n46.73 electrons per Å\n2, which was fractionated into 32 frames. More\nparameters for data collection are shown in Supplementary informa-\ntion, Supplementary Table 10.\nImage processing and 3D reconstruction\nThe raw dose-fractionated image stacks were 2× Fourier binned,\naligned, dose-weighted, and summed using MotionCor2\n56. CTF-esti-\nmation, blob particle picking, 2D reference-free classiﬁcation, initial\nmodel generation,ﬁnal 3D reﬁnement, and local resolution estimation\nwere performed in cryoSPARC57. The details of data processing were\nsummarized in Supplementary information, Supplementary Fig. 16,\nand Supplementary Table 10.\nModel building and reﬁnement\nThe initial protein model was generated using AlphaFold2 and manu-\nally revised in UCSF-Chimera and Coot28,58,59. The crRNA was manually\nbuilt in Coot based on the cryo-EM density. The complete model was\nreﬁned against the EM map by PHENIX in real space with secondary\nstructure and geometry restraints\n60.T h eﬁnal model was validated in\nthe PHENIX software package. The structural validation details for the\nﬁnal model are summarized in Supplementary information, Supple-\nmentary Table 10.\nRPA andﬂuorescence detection\nThe KRAS gene was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector using NheI and\nKpnI restriction sites, and the construct was subsequently used in RPA\nas a template. The RPA assay was performed with a GenDx ERA Kit\n(Suzhou GenDx Biotech, China). According to the instructions in the\nmanual, the 50µl RPA system contains 2µlD N At e m p l a t e ,2 . 5µl for-\nward primer (10µM), 2.5µl reverse primer (10µM), 10µlE R Ab a s i c\nbuffer, 20 µl reaction buffer, 2 µl activator, and supplementary\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63160-4\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:7877 14\nddH2O. Three microliters of the RPA reaction product were transferred\nto the Cas12a reaction. In a 20μl Cas12a reaction, additional with\n100 ng Cas12a protein, 25 pM ssDNA FQ reporter, 50 nM crRNA in a\nreaction buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100µg/mL BSA, pH\n7.9) supplied with 2.5 mM MnSO\n4, incubate at 37 °C until detection. A\nPerkinElmer EnSpire reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at\n520 nm was used forﬂuorescence detection.\nStatistics and reproducibility\nAll values in the text andﬁgures are presented as mean ± SEM of\nindependent experiments with givenn sizes. For image analysis, ima-\nges were collected from at least three independent experiments.\nGraphs were compiled, and statistical analyses were performed with\nPrism software (GraphPad) and Excel. Statistical signiﬁcance was\nevaluated with the two-tailed unpairedt-test when comparing two\ngroups. Differences between more than two samples were calculated\nusing a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
