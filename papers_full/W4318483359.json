    "abstract": "Although partial discharge (PD) measurement is a well-accepted technology to assess the quality of the insulation system of power transformers, there are still uncertainties about which frequency range PDs radiate and which frequency range should be evaluated in a measurement. This paper discusses both a UHF PD frequency range obtained from studies investigating laboratory experiments and a frequency range from numerous practical use cases with online and on-site measurements. The literature review reveals a frequency spectrum of ultrahigh-frequency (UHF) PD measurements in the range of 200 MHz to 1 GHz for most publications. Newer publications extend this range from 3 to 6 GHz. The use cases present UHF PD measurements at transformers with power ratings up to 1000 MVA to determine frequency ranges which are considered effective for practical applications. The “common” frequency range, where measurements from all use cases provide signal power, is from approximately 400 MHz to 900 MHz, but it is noted that the individual frequency range, as well as the peak UHF signal power, strongly varies from case to case. We conclude from the discussed laboratory experiments and practical observations that UHF PD measurements in power transformers using either valve or window antennas, according to Cigré, are feasible methods to detect PD.",
