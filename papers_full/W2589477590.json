Introduction\nMost of the industrial and domestic activities require large amounts of thermal energy to\ngenerate steam or heat by burning fossil fuel. After being used and degraded, low temperature\nheat is released to the environment as low grade waste heat. Large quantities of low tempera-\nture thermal waste heat streams from many industrial facilities such as power plants are\ndischarged as thermal pollutants to the air and to the water at temperatures ranging from 60\nto 100°C on a daily basis [1].\nAmong heat-driven devices are the absorption cycles. They can be divided into three classes:\nabsorption heat pump (AHP), absorption chiller (AC), and absorption heat transformer (AHT).\nAbsorption cycles become of great interest since electrical energy is replaced with low grade or\nwaste heat allowing both primary energy savings and energetic efficiency improvements [2].\nConsequently, absorption cycles enhance the atmospheric conditions by reducing the\n© The Author(s).

Environmental impacts of absorption cycles can even be\nreduced by the adoption of environmental friendly working mixtures [3, 4].\nOne of the key points to the performance of an absorption cycle is the working fluid used.\nNowadays, the most used binary systems in the absorption heat cycle are {water + lithium\nbromide (H2O + LiBr)} and {ammonia + water (NH3 +H 2O)}. The aqueous solution of LiBr is\nthe most successful working mixture in absorption cycles and widely spread all over the world\n[2, 3]. Nevertheless, LiBr aqueous solution has some main drawbacks as follows:\n Absorption heat pumps cannot operate at an evaporation temperature below 0°C because\nof the use of water as a refrigerant, which makes it unusable for subfreezing refrigeration\nor heating/domestic hot water (DHW) supplementation in cold regions. Crystallization of\n{H2O + LiBr} at high concentrations is a common problem. High vacuum conditions should\nbe preserved in the system for suitable operation of the {H2O + LiBr} system; otherwise, the\nperformance of the absorption cycle would be greatly reduced [5]. {H2O + LiBr} is corrosive\nto metals [2–6].\n {NH3 +H 2O} requires high working pressure and ammonia is toxic.\nDue to these disadvantages, which have not been solved properly, the absorption technology\nhas known a very limited expansion [7, 8]. That is why heat pump and absorption chiller\ntechnologies suffer from lack of suitable working pairs. Hence, searching for new beneficial\nand reliable binary systems (to overcome these technical limitations) has become of great\nimportance lately.\nLimited numbers of critical reviews have been published in the literature on the subject of\nabsorption technologies. In 2001, Srikhirin et al. [6] reviewed different configurations and\ntypes of absorption refrigeration cycles and working pairs. Performance development and\nenhancement of absorption cycles were evaluated. They concluded that double-stage absorp-\ntion refrigeration cycle based on {H2O + LiBr} has the highest coefficient of performance (COP)\nif compared to other systems in the market. In addition, they stated that multistage absorption\ncycles have a promising future.\nIn 2012, Sun et al. [3] have shown that {H2O + LiBr} and {NH3 +H 2O} mixtures can be improved\nby the use of additives. They also stated that working pairs dedicated to specific applications\nsuch as solar or geothermal energy should use hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as a refrigerant.\nIonic liquids (ILs) are environmentally friendly solvents, which have attracted considerable\nattention recently. Ionic liquids are salts in liquid state having melting point below some\narbitrary temperature, such as 100 °C (373 K). These solvents consist of ions (an asymmetric,\nlarge organic cation, and organic or inorganic anion). A great advantage of ILs is that their\nphysical properties such as melting points, density, and hydrophobicity can be adjusted to\ndesign different types of ILs that can be used for various applications.\nIt is now well established that ILs exhibit interesting physicochemical properties allowing their\nuse for various industrial applications [1–10].\nILs could be used as alternative working mixtures in absorption heat pump cycles. Hence, the\npossibility to have ionic liquids with a low melting point (lower than the temperature of the\nProgress and Developments in Ionic Liquids4\ncold heat source of absorption heat pumps) allows overcoming the crystallization problem of\nthe {water + LiBr} solution that can occur under some conditions [2]. Moreover, aqueous\nsolution of ionic liquids seems to be less corrosive than the {water + LiBr} solutions. Finally,\nmany ionic liquids show a high miscibility with water, which is a recommended refrigerant for\nabsorption cycles (high latent heat, low viscosity, nontoxic, etc.). Consequently, the analysis of\nbinary systems composed of {ILs + water} for this application has to be explored [10].\nFew papers were published concerning working fluids containing ILs and a refrigerant such as\nNH3, water, ethanol, or halogenated hydrocarbon series. Although many working fluids are\nproposed in the literature, there is not a complete review with comparison of their properties\nand performances. Studies mainly focus on the evaluation of {H2O + IL} systems for their\npotential use in absorption heat cycles [11, 12]. Khamooshi et al. [2] studied the performance\nof different working fluids containing ILs and different types of refrigerants in order to define\nthe most suitable binary system. The coefficient of performance obtained on binary systems\n{H2O + ILs} in absorption cooling cycle is lower than {H2O + LiBr}. Nevertheless, the COP of\nthese systems is higher than 0.7.\nIn 2014, Zheng et al. [13] presented a compilation of thermodynamic properties of binary\nsystems containing {H2Oo rN H3 or HFCs or alcohols + ILs}. The simulation of IL working\nfluids for single effect absorption cooling cycles showed that several binary systems have a real\npotential.\nPublications concerning the development of working fluids and absorption cycles almost\nexclusively focus on air conditioning and refrigeration. It seems that no previous review has\ncomprehensively summarized the studies and applications of absorption heat transformers\nusing {H2O + ILs} as the working fluid. Recently, IoLiTec has developed working mixtures\ncomposed of {H2Oo rN H3 + ILs} for absorption cycles and filled the first patent application in\nthis field in 2004, which is now owned by BASF. Meanwhile, other companies, such as DuPont\nand Degussa, are interested in using ILs in absorption cycles. This ensures the great potential\nof ILs in this application. Encouraging the use of ILs in this technology in combination with\nupgrading industrial and other waste heat could enhance the conservation of fossil fuels and\nhence decrease the emissions of greenhouse gases [14].\nThis work mainly focuses on the study of binary systems {H2O + ILs} in absorption heat\ntransformers. The first part of the paper briefly describes the absorption cycle. Then, the\nthermodynamic and physical properties of the binary systems {H2O + IL} are summarized\nand the influences of the IL structure on these properties are presented. In this section, results\nfound in the literature about the performance of absorption cycles using {H2O + IL} as working\nmixtures are also presented. The last section of this paper is devoted to the calculation of the\ncoefficient of performance of an AHT operated with each binary system {H2O + IL}.\n2. Absorption heat cycles\nAbsorption cycles perform heat exchange between several heat sources or sinks. In the sim-\nplest case, there are three heat reservoirs characterized by their relative temperature level\n(high, medium, and low) as shown inFigure 1.\nAre Ionic Liquids Suitable as New Components in Working Mixtures for Absorption Heat Transformers?\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/65756\n5\nAbsorption systems can operate according to different modes differing by the nature of the\ndriving heat and by the desired useful effect. These modes are as follows:\n Refrigerator: The driving heat is provided to the absorption cycle by a high temperature\nheat source. The low temperature source also provides heat to the cycle producing the\ncooling effect (useful effect). Heat is released to the medium temperature heat sink (gener-\nally the environment).\n Heat pump: As well as in a refrigerator, the cycle is driven by the heat provided by the high\ntemperature source. The cycle also receives heat from the low temperature source. The\nuseful heat is released to the medium temperature sink (generally a building or process\nthat requires to be heated).\n Absorption heat transformer: Compared to both previous modes, sink and sources are\nreversed. The driving heat is a medium temperature heat (generally a waste heat). The\nupgraded useful heat is rejected to the high temperature sink and degraded heat is rejected\nto the low temperature sink (generally the environment).\nAbsorption cycles are composed of five main components: evaporator, condenser, generator,\nabsorber, and solution heat exchanger (economizer) (Figure 2). They generally use a binary\nworking mixture composed of a low boiling component called the refrigerant and a high\nboiling component called the absorbent.\nIn an absorption heat transformer (Figure 3), the driving heat (medium temperature waste\nheat) is provided to the mixture of an absorbent and a refrigerant (weak solution) in the\ngenerator at a low pressure producing two streams: a pure refrigerant vapor stream and a\nliquid mixture stream (strong solution).\nThis vapor is condensed in the condenser releasing heat to the low temperature heat sink. The\ncondensate is increased to high pressure through a pump and vaporized in the evaporator,\nthanks to medium temperature heat. The strong solution passes through a pump to high\npressure and is sent to the absorber where it absorbs the vapor produced in the evaporator.\nFigure 1. Simple absorption cycle.\nProgress and Developments in Ionic Liquids6\nThis operation releases high temperature useful heat. The resulting weak solution is throttled\nthrough a valve and sent back to the generator. The solution heat exchanger allows preheating\nthe strong solution entering the absorber by exchange with the weak solution leaving the\nabsorber [15]. In refrigeration or heat pump absorption cycles (Figure 2), pressure levels are\nreversed (high pressure in the generator and in the condenser and low in the evaporator and the\nabsorber), high temperature heat is provided to the generator, low temperature heat is provided\nto the evaporator and medium temperature heat is rejected at the condenser and absorber.\nThe working mixture properties will directly affect the absorption cycle performance. The\nfollowing criteria can be followed to properly choose a working mixture [3]:\ni. The presence of absorbent in the refrigerant must increase as high as possible the boiling\npoint of the solution.\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram of an absorption refrigeration cycle; A: absorber, C: condenser, E: evaporator, G: generator,\nSHE: heat exchanger.\nAre Ionic Liquids Suitable as New Components in Working Mixtures for Absorption Heat Transformers?\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/65756\n7\nii. In order to reduce refrigerant flow rate, its vaporization latent heat has to be as high as\npossible.\ni. In order to reduce exchange areas, pressure decreases and more generally the size and\ncost of equipment, viscosity of the solutions have to be the lowest as possible whereas\nthermal conductivity and diffusion coefficient have to be the highest as possible.\nii. Components of the working mixture should not be too expensive.\niii. Components of the mixtures should be noncorrosive and nontoxic.\niv. The environmental impact of the working mixture should be the lowest as possible,\nespecially in terms of GWP and ODP .\nTo assess the energetic performance level of an absorption cycle, a criterion was defined: the\ncoefficient of performance. Its expression depends on the kind of absorption cycle (refrigera-\ntion, heat pump, or AHT). Nevertheless, it is possible to define it as the ratio of the useful heat\nflow exchanged to the costly heat flow consumed [1]. For example, in a refrigeration cycle the\nexpression of COP becomes [7–16]:\nCOP ¼ Low temperature heat flow exchanged at the evaporator\nHig htemperature heat flow provided at the generatorþ Mechanical pumping power\n(1)\nFor an absorption heat transformer the COP expression is [8]\nFigure 3.

Working fluids containing {water + ILs} for absorption cycles\nWater can be considered as a green refrigerant, nontoxic, having high latent heat and excellent\nthermal characteristics. ILs used in the working fluids {H2O + ILs} have to be hygroscopic and\nstable in aqueous solution. Numerous articles have studied the behavior of ILs with water, but\nthere is still a lack of thermodynamic data for such mixtures.\n3.1. {H2O + ILs} binary systems in the literature\nRecently, the performances of binary mixtures {H2O + IL} have been evaluated as alternative\nbinary systems in the absorption cycle [16–18, 19]. Numerous articles present thermodynamic\nstudies of binary systems containing water and IL.Table 1lists the most studied ILs in the\nliterature and the thermophysical properties available. Alkylsulfate- and alkylphosphaste-\nbased ILs are well known, and their performance in working fluids {H2O + IL} was evaluated\nin different absorption cycles [7–26].\nThe binary systems {H 2O + dialkylimidazolium alkylphosphate}, 1-dimethylimidazolium\ndimethylphosphate, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate were extensively\nstudied in numerous papers, where not only the data of vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) but also\ndensity, viscosity, heat capacity, and excess enthalpy are available [7–25, 27–29]. These data make it\npossible to simulate the performance of these binary mixtures as working fluids in the absorption\nrefrigeration cycle [7–25, 27, 30]. The simulation results show that the cycle performance of both\nsystems is lower but close to the value obtained with the conventional working pair {H2O+L i B r } .\nYokozeki and Shiflett [31] also examined the feasibility of different binary systems {H2O + IL} in an\nabsorption cooling cycle and they found out that the best system is {H2O + [EMIM][DMP]}.\nThe performance of {H2O + LiBr} is still higher with a COP of 0.78 and a solution flow rate 53%\nsmaller than [EMIM][DMP]. Nevertheless, the use of {H2O + [DMIM][DMP]} as the working\nfluid enables to work in a large range of temperatures and to stop crystallization and corrosion\ncaused by {H2O + LiBr}. Several papers were focused on the measurements of thermodynamic\nproperties of the binary system {H2O + [EMIM][EtSO4]} [16–25, 27, 30, 32], {H2O + [EMIM][Ac]}\n[33, 34], or {H2O + [HOEtMIM][Cl]} [35]. Even if these systems have some interesting proper-\nties such as low density and heat capacity or strong negative deviations from Raoult’s law, no\nsimulation of the performance of these working fluids in an AHT was presented.\n4. Thermodynamic properties of {H2O + IL}\nThe knowledge of thermodynamic properties, phase behavior, and safety/environmental haz-\nards of {H2O + IL} is required for the evaluation of this system in an AHT. The following\nsection presents the behavior of ILs in the presence of water and the influence of their structure\non thermodynamic properties.\nAre Ionic Liquids Suitable as New Components in Working Mixtures for Absorption Heat Transformers?\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/65756\n9\nILs Refrigerant\nVLE measuring\nmethods\nThermo.\nPara.

Thermodynamic models for the representation of a binary system {H2O + IL}\nA large number of thermodynamic models have been used to represent the phase diagrams of\nbinary systems {H2O + IL}. Some groups show that the NRTL model can be successfully used\nto represent thermodynamic properties of systems containing ILs [7 –25, 27–29, 32–37].\nAlevizou et al. [38] also used the UNIFAC model to describe the phase equilibria of solvent/\nionic liquid systems. While the ionic liquids were based on an imidazolium cation and a\nhexafluorophosphate anion, water was considered to be the refrigerant. Two new main\ngroups, the imidazolium and the hexafluorophosphate groups, were introduced in UNIFAC.\nSAFT-type equation of state was also used to represent mixtures containing ILs. This equation\nis a good tool to evaluate the density of pure ILs, solute activity coefficients but also VLE or\nLLE of binary or ternary mixtures {solute 1 + solute 2 + IL} [39, 40]. Cubic equations of state\nsuch as Peng-Robinson (PR) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) were also used to represent\nquite accurate VLE, bubble point data or critical points of systems containing ionic liquids,\ngases, and/or liquids [31, 33–35, 37–45].\n4.2. Experimental thermodynamic data of {H2O + IL}\n4.2.1. Vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE)\nThe experimental techniques used for VLE measurements are a boiling point technique [16–25,\n30, 35, 37, 38, 46], static apparatus [32], and a quasi-static ebulliometer method [37]. The boiling\npoint technique is the most appropriate to study mixtures containing ILs. Most of the articles\nrelated to VLE measurements concerning the binary systems {H2O + IL} are listed inTable 1.\nActivity coefficient can be calculated from VLE data. This parameter illustrating the deviation\nfrom ideality of the mixture can be used to investigate the interaction between H2O and ILs\nand the hydrophilicity of the IL [16–39].

Therefore, good working pairs are those presenting a highly\nnegative deviation from Raoult's law [47].\nMost binary systems {water + ILs} present activity coefficients lower than unity. The deviation\nfrom Raoult’s law of {H2O + IL} is proportional to the IL content [17–19, 23–33, 36]. With\nrespect to the anion, Ficke [16] has shown that the γ values decrease according to:\n[(CF3SO2)2N]− > [BF4]− > [EtSO4]− > [lactate]− > [CH3SO4]− > [glycolate]− > [(CH3)2PO4]−.\nIt is important to note that dialkylimidazolium [(CF3SO2)2N] with water present a miscibility gap\n[28]. The ability of IL to increase the water boiling temperature can be estimated using a simple\nrelationship based on solvation model’s parameters such the hydrogen-bond basicity [48].\nStudies on water sorption by imidazolium-based ILs with anions [Cl]−, [BF4]−, [Br]−, [Tf2N]−,\nand [PF6]− show that ILs with the shorter alkyl chain length lead to the highest water sorption\ncapacity [7, 25–37]. Moreover, it was found that imidazolium cation is more efficient than\npyridinium cation [49]. Cao et al. [49] also studied the anion effect on water sorption for nine\nILs with [BMIM]+ cation and they found that ILs followed this trend [Ac]− > [Cl]− > [Br]− >\n[TFA]− > [NO3]− > [TFO]− > [BF4]− > [Tf2N]− > [CHO]− > [PF6]−. The nature of the IL anion plays\nan important role on the boiling temperatures and its impact is as follows: [CF3SO3]− < [SCN]−\n< [CF3CO2]− < [TOS]− < [Br]− <[ C1SO3]− <[ C1CO2]− [39]. This work shows clearly that the\nobserved trend is related to the anion and to its capacity to interact with water. Other research\ngroups confirmed that anion has an essential rule that aiming to lower the vapor pressure of\nwater H2O [25, 27, 30, 32, 33]. Seiler et al. [50] have shown that some ILs such as acetate and\nchloride-based ionic liquids are not suitable for absorptions cycles due to their insufficient\nstability and/or too high corrosion rates.\nAll VLE of binary systems {H2O + IL} found in the literature have been correlated using the\nNRTL model. The average relative deviations on activity coefficient and pressure obtained\nusing the NRTL model range between 0.01 and 3.5%. Deviations of the 35 investigated systems\nare within ±13%.\n4.2.2. Heat capacity\nHeat capacity evaluates the heat storage capacity of a fluid [51]. Only one theoretical model\nbased on an artificial neural network is proposed in the literature to predict the heat capacity of\nbinary systems containing ILs [52]. This approach gives good estimate ofCp of mixtures\ncontaining ILs with an average absolute relative deviation of about 1.60%.\nIn general, heat capacity is expressed using a temperature- and composition-dependent poly-\nnomial equation [35]:\nCp ¼ ∑\n3\ni¼0\nðAiþBiTÞxm2\ni (3)\nwhere Cp is the mass heat capacity in kJ kg−1 K−1, Ai and Bi a r ea d j u s t a b l ep a r a m e t e r s ,T is the\nabsolute temperature in K, andxm2 is the mass fraction of ILs. We have correlated all heat capacity\nProgress and Developments in Ionic Liquids12\ndata of {H2O + ILs} published in the literature using Eq. (3). The mass excess heat capacity,Cp\nE can\nbe calculated from the heat capacities of th em i x t u r ea n dt h a to ft h ep u r ec o m p o u n d s :\nCE\np ¼ Cp−∑xmi /C1 CP, i (4)\nwhere Cp is the mass heat capacity in kJ kg−1 K−1 of the mixture,Cp,i is the mass heat capacity of\nthe pure compound andxmi is its mass fraction.\nThe low mass heat capacity values of the binary systems {H2O + ILs} lead to reduce power\nconsumption, beneficial to heat transfer and improves the COP in the absorption cycle [7, 26,\n28, 29, 31, 33–45, 47–55].\n4.2.3. Excess enthalpy (HE)\nHE is a key parameter for the simulation of the performance of AHT and it also gives an insight\ninto the interactions between the molecules. FewHE data for binary systems {H2O + ILs} can be\nfound in the literature. This leads to make the hypothesis thatHE is equaled to zero in simulation.\nGarcia-Miaja et al. [56] measured HE for different binary mixtures containing triflate or\nalkylsulfate or [BMPyr]-based ILs. All collected data show that the sign ofHE is mainly related\nto the nature of the anion [56].\nKurnia and Coutinho [10] reviewed the behavior ofHE for binary systems composed of {H2O+\nILs}. They found that the conductor-like screening model for real system (COSMO-RS) is a\nsuccessful estimating method to predict the behavior of the interaction between water and ILs.\nIt is obvious from the literature [10–16] that the positive (endothermic)HE of the binary system\nmainly depends on the hydrogen bonding, water molecules, and hydrophobicity. Weak inter-\naction between the water-IL binary system causes water to use the energy of the system to\nrearrange their molecules and the process turn to be endothermic and the reverse occurs in the\ncase of the exothermic process. Ficke [16] stated that with the increase of the alkyl chain length\nthe hydrophobicity increases hence decreasing the negativity ofHE.\nHE data found in the literature are regressed using Redlich-Kister polynomials [25]:\nHE ¼ xm1xm2 ∑\nn\ni¼1\nAixmi\n2 (5)\nwhere HE is the excess enthalpy in kJ kg−1, Ai is the adjustable parameter, andxm i is the mass\nfraction of speciesi (i = 1, 2).\nWe used Eq. (5) to regress allHE data found in the literature.\n4.2.4. Density\nDensity is an important property because its knowledge is necessary to evaluate the pumping\ncost in a process. The density of pure ILs roughly ranges between 1.1 and 1.6 g cm−3. The\ndensity of an IL depends on the type of anion and cation, but the key parameter is the anion.\nHydrophobicity of ILs has also an important effect on the density of binary mixtures {H2O+\nIL}. The hydrophobicity of a dialkylimidazolium-based IL increases with an increase of the\nAre Ionic Liquids Suitable as New Components in Working Mixtures for Absorption Heat Transformers?\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/65756\n13\nalkyl chain length [26, 31, 33–35, 37–45, 47–57]. Consequently, the density of such ILs decreases\nwith the increase of the alkyl chain length.\nAn increase in water content or temperature causes a decrease in the density in most of the\nbinary systems studied. Hence, physical properties of ILs can be adjusted to fulfill the needs of\napplications for hydrophilic ILs by adding water or changing the temperature [57].\nThe density data for the 19 investigated binary systems were fitted [35] using Eq. (6).\nρ ¼ ∑\n3\ni¼0\nðai þ biTÞx2\ni (6)\nwhere ρ is the density of the solution in g cm−3, T is the absolute temperature in K,x2i is the\nmolar fraction of the ILs, andai and bi are adjustable parameters.\nExcess molar volume (VE) is an important parameter for the process design while it gives\ninformation on the nonideality of the working fluid. In the case of binary mixtures {H2O+I L } ,\nthe sign of excess molar volumes is related to the structure of the IL (anion, cation, and alkyl\nchain length) [26, 31, 33–35, 37–45, 47–56, 58, 59]. Generally, the anion imposes the sign ofVE.\nHydrophobic anions ([BF4], [SCN], and [CF3SO4]) leading to repulsive interactions with water\nhave positive excess molar volumes. Strong IL-H2O interactions observed with anions containing\noxygen atoms lead to negativeVE [26, 46, 60]. Gonzalez et al. [61] stated thatVE behavior for their\ninvestigated binary systems according to the cation type has the following trend: imidazolium\nVE > pyridiniumVE ≅ pyrrolidinium VE. A full description of excess molar volumes of binary\nmixtures containing {H2O + IL} can be found in the recent review of Bahadur et al. [62].\n4.2.5. Viscosity\nIt is well known that pure ILs have higher viscosity than other solvents such as water,\nmethanol, and ethanol [26]. This may enlarge the AHT size (exchange area) and increase the\npower required for the pumping process [63]. Nevertheless, various publications [26, 31, 33–\n35, 37–67] stated that viscosity of ILs sharply decreases when temperature increases and/or ILs\nare mixed with water. Taking into account that AHT has a high generator and absorber\ntemperature (between 80 and 150°C), the viscosity of the {H2O + ILs} should not be a limitation\nfor their use as absorbents in AHT [36]. The viscosity of {H2O + ILs} binary systems decreases\nbecause of the weak interaction between the IL anion and cation so the mobility of ions\nincreases and the viscosity decreases [67]. It was noticed that fluorinated anions have lower\nviscosity than other anions such as alkylsulfates [64].\n4.2.6. Thermal decomposition\nThermal decomposition could possibly be oneof the most important properties to measure\nduring the initial screening of an IL, especially for the operating temperatures of the pro-\ncesses related to this work. Most of the decomposition temperatures of ILs are measured\nusing weight loss thermogravimetric (TGA) e xperiments and selected data are given in\nTable 2.\nProgress and Developments in Ionic Liquids14\nNevertheless, it must be kept in mind that data taken from TGA will not serve to determine the\nmaximum temperature limit for working without decomposition of the IL because this tech-\nnique overestimates the decomposition temperature [68–70]. The experimental procedure\nproposed by Seiler et al. [50] based on a long-time thermal decomposition analysis seems to\nbe more appropriate.\nThe decomposition temperatures of ionic liquids containing the [TF2N] anion are higher than\nothers [16–45, 47–50, 53, 54]. Ficke [16] and Seiler et al. [50] have shown that the decomposition\ntemperature of [EMIM]+-based ILs ranges between 178°C and 388°C (Table 2). The decompo-\nsition temperature mainly depends on two structural parameters: the nature of the anion and\nthe alkyl chain length [46, 50–52, 55–71]. Ficke et al. [55] found that [EMIM][EtSO4] reacts with\nwater to give [EMIM][HSO4] and ethanol. Another negative effect of using ILs is their hydro-\nlysis [72]. Kinetic of hydrolysis is governed by the pH and the temperature of system [73, 74].\n[TOS]-, [DMP]-, [BF4]-, and [PF6]-based ILs are known to be unstable in the presence of water\nunder specific conditions [75].\n5. Coefficient of performance (COP)\n5.1. Simulation of the AHT cycle performance\nThis work focuses on single effect absorption heat transformers (AHT).

The objective temper-\nature level of the upgraded heat is also an input in this problem (the high-temperature level).\nHence, temperaturesTG, TE, TC and TA of the generator, the evaporator, the condenser, and the\nabsorber, respectively, are known and taken as independent variables in the present research.\nThe enthalpy of a liquid mixture is expressed as follows:\nh ¼ xm\n1 h1 þ xm\n2 h2 þ Δmixh (25)\nwith\nAre Ionic Liquids Suitable as New Components in Working Mixtures for Absorption Heat Transformers?\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/65756\n17\nh1 ¼ href þ 1\nρ1;liq, Tref\n∗ðp−pref Þþ ∫\nT\nTref\nCp,1dT (26)\nh2 ¼ href þ 1\nρ2;liq, Tref\n∗ðp−pref Þþ ∫\nT\nTref\nCp,2dT (27)\nwhere h1 and h2 are the enthalpy of pure liquid H2O and IL,xm\n1 and xm\n2 are the mass fraction of\nH2O and IL, respectively,Δmixh is mixing enthalpy of the system, which can be sometimes\nneglected.

The main one is the\ncoefficient of performance. Its expression is given in Eq. (2) as the ratio of useful heat flow\nproduced at the absorber to the waste heat flows provided to the generator and to the\nevaporator (pumping work is neglected).\nAmong other meaningful criteria,Δxm is the difference between ionic liquid mass fractions in\nthe strong and weak solutions.\nΔxm ¼ xm\n8 −xm\n5 ¼ xm\ns −xm\nw (28)\nIf COP is used to represent the quantitative aspect of heat upgrading, the gross temperature lift\nΔt, which is the temperature level difference between the upgraded heat and the waste heat,\nprovides a qualitative performance criterion. It is defined as follows:\nΔt ¼ TA−TE (29)\nAnother important criterion is the solution circulation ratiof, which is defined as the ratio of\nthe strong solution mass flow rate to the vapor mass flow rate:\nf ¼ _m7\n_m1 ¼ xms\nðxms −xmw Þ\n(30)\nThis criterion allows knowing if the use of one working mixture leads or not to high solution\nflow rate which is linked to the capital cost (cost of the required working mixture and pumps)\nand operating costs (pumping energy cost). Observed values off for the {H2O + LiBr} and {H2O\n+N H3} systems are generally low (typically around 10 [2–16]).\nAnother criterion to assess system compactness is the available heat output per unit mass of\nrefrigerant, q (kJ kg–1):\nProgress and Developments in Ionic Liquids18\nq ¼ QA\n_m1\n(31)\n5.2. COP for the absorption refrigeration cycle\nThe performance of {H2O + ILs} as working fluids was mainly evaluated for the absorption\nrefrigeration cycle. Zhang and Hu [27] estimated the COP of an absorption chiller using {water\n+ [EMIM][DMP]} and {H2O + LiBr} mixtures under the same operating conditions. {H2O+\n[EMIM][DMP]} leads to a value of COP higher than 0.7 that is lower than that obtained with\n{H2O + LiBr}.\nUnder precise conditions, Kim et al. [63] found that the COP value for a {H2O + [EMIM][BF4]}-\nbased refrigeration cycle can reach 0.91, this good performance is linked to the suitable\ncompatibility of water with [EMIM][BF4] and to the excellent intrinsic properties of water as a\nrefrigerant.\nThe {H2O + [DMIM][DMP]} mixture has been studied by Dong et al. [7] and was compared to\n{H2O + LiBr} in a single-effect absorption refrigeration configuration. The ionic liquid-based\nworking mixture leads to close performance to those obtained with the conventional mixture.\nNevertheless, {H2O + [DMIM][DMP]} presents the advantage to allow a wider temperature\nworking range as well as avoiding corrosion and crystallization problems.\n5.3. Absorption heat transformer\nA VBA dedicated calculation code has been developed to evaluate the performance of {H2O+\nIL} mixture as a working fluid in an absorption heat transformer (Figures 4and 5).\nSimulation results for both {H2O + IL} mixtures and conventional fluids as working fluids in\nAHT are presented inTable 3.\nFigure 4.

Calculated COP of binary systems {water + ILs} presented.\nProgress and Developments in Ionic Liquids22\nFigure 8shows that an increase in the condenser temperature leads to a decrease in the COP .\nThis behavior is due to the fact that the low pressure level evolves the same way as the\ncondenser temperature. Hence, when the condenser temperature increases, the strong solution\nionic liquid fraction will decrease andf increases. For the investigated working pairs, the COP\nremains unchanged forTC lower than 30°C. The COP sharply decreases especially for {H2O+\nLiBr}, {H2O + [BMIM][MeSO4]}, {H2O + [BMIM][Triflate]}, and {H2O + [EMIM][EtSO4]} when\nTC is higher than 30°C.\nFigure 8.

Circulation ratiof of binary systems {water + ILs} presented.\nAre Ionic Liquids Suitable as New Components in Working Mixtures for Absorption Heat Transformers?\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/65756\n23\nFigure 9shows that an increase ofTE or TG leads to an increase of the COP. In fact, the high\npressure level of AHT depends on the evaporator temperature. IncreasingTE (or TG) leads to a\ndecrease of the weak solution concentration by decreasing the flow ratio. The lower flow ratio\nresults in a higher heat flow released during absorption and consequently in a higher COP.\nFigure 9shows that the evolution of the COP values versus the generator temperature is quite\nsimilar to {H2O + IL} for all binary systems studied in this work. The evolution of COP values\nwith TG firstly increases, then stabilizes and finally decreases. WhenTG approaches its mini-\nmal value,f tends to reach infinity and so it requires the generation of heat. Consequently, the\nCOP of the cycle tends toward zero. With the increase of generator temperature,f decreases,\nCOP sharply increases and then smoothens.\nIt can be seen fromFigure 10that the COP of an AHTdecreases at different rates depending on the\nworking mixture when absorber temperature (TA) increases. This behavior can be explained in\nFigure 11that illustrates the ionic liquid mass fraction variation of the weak solutionxm\nw with TA.\nA decrease ofxm\nw means that the less refrigerant has been absorbed and consequently less heat is\nreleased at the absorber, which leads to lower the COP . The same behavior was observed by Zhang\nand Hu [8].Figure 10shows that the COP of all the binary systems {H2O+I L }a sw e l la s{ H2O+\nLiBr} is basically unchanged when the gross temperature lift is lower than 45 °C. Upon increasing\nthe gross temperature lift more than 45°C, the COP of {H2O + LiBr} and {H2O + ILs} sharply\ndecreases.\nThe available heat output per unit mass of refrigerant (q) for the studied binary systems was\ncalculated and compared with Zhang and Hu [8] data under the same conditions. It was found\nthat q for {H2O + [DMIM][DMP]} is 2029 kJ kg−1 and for {H2O + [HOEtMIM][Cl]} is less than\n2026 kJ kg−1. For the other binary systems,q ranges between 2012 and 1527 kJ kg−1 (Table 4).\nThese values must be compared with those obtained for {H2O + LiBr}: 2466 kJ kg−1 and 311 kJ\nkg−1 for {TFE + E181}. Hence, to produce the same amount of useful heat, the refrigerant flow\nrate is lower when using water-based mixtures (water latent heat of vaporization is much\nhigher than that of E181).\nFigure 9. COP of binary systems {water + ILs} versus (TG, E) TM for single-effect absorption heat transformer cycle.\nProgress and Developments in Ionic Liquids24\nFigure 10. COP of binary systems {water + ILs} versus (TA) TH for single-effect absorption heat transformer cycle.\nFigure 11. Effect of (TA) TH on xm\nw .\nAre Ionic Liquids Suitable as New Components in Working Mixtures for Absorption Heat Transformers?\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/65756\n25\nThe concentration (mass fraction) of ILs in the strong solution is exceeding 0.9 for most of the\nbinary systems studied, and is only 0.64 for {H2O + LiBr} (Table 3). This behavior is not in favor\nof ionic liquid-based working mixtures and will particularly lead to increased pumping costs.\nSimulation results show that for {H2O + [DMIM][DMP]}, {H2O + [HOEtMIM][Cl]}, {H2O+\n[EMIM][Ac]}, {H2O + [EMIM][TFA]}, and {H2O + [DEMA][OMS]} mixtures, COP values are\nclose to, but lower than, that obtained working with {H2O + LiBr}. Nevertheless, these slightly\nlow performances of ionic liquid-based mixtures can be counterbalanced by the ability to reach\nhigher gross temperature lifts and to potentially avoid corrosion issues.\nSimulations for evaporator temperatureTE, condenser temperatureTC, absorber temperature\nTA, and generator temperatureTG are set to 80, 20, 130, and 80 °C, respectively, which shows\nthat the COP values for the studied binary systems have the following behavior:\n[DMIM][DMP] > [HOEtMIM][Cl] > [EMIM][Ac] > [DEMA][OMS] > [EMIM][TFA] > [EMIM]\n[DMP] > [BMIM][BF4] > [EMIM][Triflate] > [EMIM][EtSO4] > [BMIM][Triflate]. We can con-\nclude that ionic liquids with a short-alkyl chain lead to higher COP values and a lower\ncirculation ratiof.\nSimulations indicate that binary systems {H2O + acetate or chloride-based ILs} have high COP .\nNonetheless, these families of ILs are not sufficiently stable and they present high corrosion\nrates [50]. It was noticed that binary system composed of {H2O + [BMIM][MeSO4]} exhibits\nsmaller Δt than the other investigated 11 systems. Its largest observedΔt is about 40 K and the\nlowest is 30 K. Simulation of the binary system consisting of {H2O + [BMIM][MeSO4]} is not\npromising due to low solubility of IL in water or to stability of the IL [16].\nThirty-three binary systems out of 39 are found to have only VLE data available, the literature\nlacking other thermodynamic properties. Using NRTL, the VLE data of these 33 binary sys-\ntems were correlated, andf was determined. Simulations for these binary systems performed\nwith evaporator temperature TE, condenser temperature TC, absorber temperature TA, and\ngenerator temperature TG are set to 80°C, 20°C, 130°C, and 80°C, respectively. Simulation\nresults showed that there are promising binary systems exhibiting low f values such as\n[BMIM][C1SO3], [BMIM][I], [BMPyr][DCA], which are 19.892, 16.958, and 17.247, respectively.\nTC TG TE TA\n20 80 80 130\nBinary system q (kJ kg−1) Binary system q (kJ kg−1)\n{H2O + [DMIM][DMP]} 1982.31 {H 2O + [EMIM][TFA]} 1871.63\n{H2O + [EMIM][DMP]} 1867.90 {H 2O + [HOEtMIM][Cl]} 1974.05\n{H2O + [EMIM][EtSO4]} 1391.97 {H 2O + [BMIM][Triflate]} 1198.78\n{H2O + [EMIM][AC]} 1953.77 {H 2O + [BMIM][BF4]} 1777.21\n{H2O + [EMIM][Triflate]} 1636.28 {H 2O + [DEMA][OMs]} 1932.00\nTable 4.

Conclusion\nA large number of binary mixtures {H2O + ILs} have been identified to be used in absorption\nheat transformers. The resulting performances of these new working fluids were evaluated for\nsingle-effect absorption heat transformer cycles.\nIonic liquid-based working mixtures lead to slightly low COP than the classical {H2O + LiBr}\nmixture and larger circulation ratios. Nevertheless, the possibility to find ILs that are signifi-\ncantly less corrosive than LiBr is a condition for reliable operation and a moderate investment\ncost. Moreover, many ILs are totally miscible with water which avoid crystallization problems.\nIt must be kept in mind that thermal and chemical stability of {H20 + IL} mixtures have to be\nassessed in order to prove their practical use for industrial applications.\nAuthor details\nEl-Shaimaa Abumandour, Fabrice Mutelet* and Dominique Alonso\n*Address all correspondence to: fabrice.mutelet@univ-lorraine.fr\nLaboratoire Réactions et Génie des Procédés (CNRS UMR 7274), Ecole Nationale Supérieure\ndes Industries Chimiques, Université de Lorraine, Nancy, France\nReferences\n[1] Horuz I, Kurt B.
