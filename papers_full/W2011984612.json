Youseﬁ and Frank R. Kschischang,Fellow, IEEE\nAbstract—The nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT), a powerful\ntool in soliton theory and exactly solvable models, is a method for\nsolving integrable partial differential equations governing wave\npropagation in certain nonlinear media. The NFT decorrelates\nsignal degrees-of-freedom in such models, in much the same way\nthat the Fourier transform does for linear systems. In this three-\npart series of papers, this observation is exploited for data trans-\nmission over integrable channels such as optical ﬁbers, where\npulse propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schr¨odinger\nequation. In this transmission scheme, which can be viewed as a\nnonlinear analogue of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing\ncommonly used in linear channels, information is encoded inthe\nnonlinear frequencies and their spectral amplitudes. Unlike most\nother ﬁber-optic transmission schemes, this technique deals with\nboth dispersion and nonlinearity directly and unconditionally\nwithout the need for dispersion or nonlinearity compensation\nmethods. This ﬁrst paper explains the mathematical tools that\nunderlie the method.\nIndex Terms—Nonlinear Fourier transform, integrable chan-\nnels, Lax pairs, Zakharov-Shabat spectral problem, Fourier\ntransforms, ﬁber-optic communications.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA\nN EVOLUTION equation is a partial differential equa-\ntion (PDE) for an unknown functionqpt,zq of the form\nqz “ Kpqq, (1)\nwhere Kpqq is an expression involvingq and its derivatives\nwith respect tot. In (1) and throughout this paper, subscripts\nare used to denote partial derivatives with respect to the\ncorresponding variable.\nThe evolution equation (1) is a PDE in1 ` 1 dimensions,\ni.e., one variablet P R represents a temporal dimension and\none variablez ě 0 represents a spatial dimension. In most\nmathematical literature, the roles ofz and t are interchanged,\nso rather than a spatial evolution as in (1), mathematicians\nstudy temporal evolution.\nAn important example of an evolution equation, and the\none that motivates this work, is the stochastic nonlinear\nSchr¨ odinger (NLS) equation governing the complex envelope\nSubmitted for publication on February 16, 2012; revised February 15,\n2013; accepted March 21, 2013.

The\nsymbol τ represents retarded time, measured in seconds,i.e.,\nτ “ t´ β1ℓwhere tis ordinary time andβ1 is a constant, and\nQpτ,ℓq is the complex envelope of the signal propagating in\nthe ﬁber. The coefﬁcientβ2, measured ins2{km, is called\nthe chromatic dispersion coefﬁcient, whileγ, measured in\nW´ 1km´ 1, is the nonlinearity parameter.

It is assumed thatQpτ,ℓq is\nbandlimited toW for allℓ,0 ď ℓď L.\nThe stochastic NLS equation (2) models both chromatic\ndispersion (captured by thejβ2B2Q{Bτ2 term), which is\nresponsible for temporal broadening, and the Kerr nonlinearity\n(captured by theγ|Q|2Q term), which is responsible for\nspectral broadening. Pulse propagation is governed by the\ntension between these effects and can be linearly dominated,\nnonlinearly dominated, or solitonic (in which case the two\neffects are balanced). The NLS equation deﬁnes a nonlinear\ndispersive waveform channel fromQpτ,0q at the transmitter\ntoQpτ,Lq at the receiver.\nSuch a nonlinear dispersive waveform channel is a major\ndeparture from the classical additive white Gaussian noise\nand wireless fading channels in terms of analytical difﬁculty.\nHere the signal degrees-of-freedom couple together via the\nnonlinearity and dispersion in a complicated manner, making\nit difﬁcult to establish the channel input-output map, even\ndeterministically. Most current approaches assume a linearly-\ndominated regime of operation, consider the nonlinearity\nas a small perturbation, or are geared towards managing\nand suppressing the (detrimental) effects of the nonlinear\nand dispersive terms. In-line dispersion management, digital\nbackpropagation, and other forms of electronic pre-and post-\ncompensation belong to this class of methods (see [3]–[7] and\nreferences therein).\n0000–0000/00$00.00 c⃝ 2014 IEEE\n2 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY\nIn this paper we adopt a different philosophy. Rather\nthan treating nonlinearity and dispersion as nuisances, we\nseek a transmission scheme that is fundamentally compatible\nwith these effects. We effectively “diagonalize” the nonlinear\nSchr¨ odinger channel with the help of the nonlinear Fourier\ntransform (NFT), a powerful tool for solvingintegrablenon-\nlinear dispersive partial differential equations [8], [9]. The\nNFT uncovers linear structure hidden in the one-dimensional\ncubic nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation, and can be viewed as\na generalization of the (ordinary) Fourier transform to certain\nnonlinear systems.\nWith the help of the nonlinear Fourier transform, we are able\nto represent a signal by its discrete and continuous nonlinear\nspectra. While the signal propagates along the ﬁber based on\nthe complicated NLS equation, the action of the channel on\nits spectral components is given by simple independent linear\nequations. Just as the (ordinary) Fourier transform converts a\nlinear convolutional channelyptq “ xptq ˙ hptq into a number\nof parallel scalar channels, the nonlinear Fourier transform\nconverts a nonlinear dispersive channel described by aLax\nconvolution(see Sec. III) into a number of parallel scalar\nchannels. This suggests that information can be encoded (in\nanalogy with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing) in\nthe nonlinear spectra.\nThe nonlinear Fourier transform is intertwined with the\nexistence of soliton solutions to the NLS equation. Solitons\nare pulses that retain their shape (or return periodically to\ntheir initial shape) during propagation, and can be viewed\nas system eigenfunctions, similar to the complex exponentials\nejωt , which are eigenfunctions of linear systems. An arbitrary\nwaveform can be viewed as a combination of solitons, associ-\nated with the discrete nonlinear spectrum, and a non-solitonic\n(radiation) component, associated with the continuous nonlin-\near spectrum.\nThe goal of this ﬁrst article is to introduce the mathematical\ntools that underlie this approach to information transmission.\nThese tools are sufﬁciently general to encompass not only\nthe nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation, but also other completely\nintegrable nonlinear dispersive PDEs. Thus, the transmission\nscheme described here can also be applied to any channel\nmodel in this general class. These tools are also described in\nmathematics and physics (see,e.g., [8]–[10]); here we attempt\nto extract those aspects of the theory that are relevant to the\nengineering aspects of the information transmission problem.\nIn Part II [11] we will provide numerical methods for forward\nNFT at the receiver and in Part III [12] describe a nonlinear\nfrequency-division multiplexing communication method based\non NFT, provide algorithms to implement inverse NFT at the\ntransmitter and give examples of achievable spectral efﬁcien-\ncies in actual ﬁber-optic systems.\nAfter submitting this paper, we became aware of the related\npaper of Hasegawa and Nyu [13] introducingeigenvalue\ncommunication, in which the authors propose to encode in-\nformation in quantities conserved under NLS propagation, and\nuse the inverse scattering transform to decode the amplitude of\nan isolated soliton-like pulseAsechptq in a single-user, point-\nto-point channel. Using conserved quantities can be helpful, as\nit has the potential to simplify communication system design.\nHowever, no improvement in capacity is achieved relative to\na scheme which encodes information in an equivalent, but\nnot necessarily conserved, set of parameters (e.g., modulating\namplitude and phase and using backpropagation for decoding).\nOur motivation for introducing transmission schemes based\non the NFT stems—not from the simplicity arising through the\nuse of conserved quantities (as in [13]) but rather—from our\nobservation that the use of conventional linear multiplexing in\nnonlinear channels inevitably leads to an interference-limited\nmultiuser system [12]. As a result, a major factor contributing\nto the capacity limitations in optical ﬁber networks [3] is\nthe use of wavelength-division multiplexing. By introducing\nnonlinear frequency-division multiplexing (NFDM) based on\nthe NFT (exploiting the integrability of the NLS equation),\na transmission scheme without deterministic distortions can\nresult; see [Part III, particularly Sections VI. F and VI. G]for\nfurther details about NFDM in comparison with [13]. Thus\nwe use the tools of integrable systems for a different purpose\nthan in [13].\nWe will ﬁnd it convenient to work with the nonlinear\nSchr¨ odinger equation (2) in a normalized form. By changing\nvariables\nq“ Q\n?\nP, z “ l\nL , t “ τ\nT0\n,\nwithT0 “\na\n|β2|L{2 and P “ 2{pγLq, we get the normalized\nNLS equation\njqzpt,zq “ qtt ` 2|qpt,zq|2qpt,zq ` npt,zq, (3)\nwhere\nE\n␣\nnpt,zqn˚ pt1 ,z1 q\n(\n“ σ2\n0 L\nPT0\nδWn pt´ t1 qδpz´ z1q,\nwhere Wn “ WT0 is the normalized bandwidth. Throughout\nthis paper, (3) will be our primary and motivating illustrative\nexample.\nII. A BRIEF H ISTORY OF THE N ONLINEAR FOURIER\nT RANSFORM\nThe nonlinear Fourier transform (also known as the inverse\nscattering transform or IST) was originally developed as a\nmethod for solving certain nonlinear dispersive partial dif-\nferential equations. These are integrable PDEs,i.e., nonlinear\ndifferential equations exhibiting certain hidden linearity. There\nare several integrable equations having physical signiﬁcance,\namong which is the NLS equation. The IST method was a\nresult of extensive efforts in theoretical physics and applied\nmathematics in 1960s and later, closely associated with the\nnotion of solitons in integrable models [8], [9].\nIn the 1950s, in one of the ﬁrst dynamical-systems sim-\nulations performed on a computer [14], Fermi, Pasta and\nUlam performed a numerical experiment to understand why\nsolids have ﬁnite heat conductivity. They modeled the solid\nas a lattice with point masses at the lattice points coupled\nwith springs each having a quadratic nonlinearity. To their\nsurprise, rather than observing an equipartition of energy\namong all Fourier modes, energy cycled periodically among a\nYOUSEFI AND KSCHISCHANG 3\nfew low-order modes. Such behavior implies that the nonlinear\noscillator behaves somehow linearly.\nIn the 1960s, Zabusky and Kruskal showed that equation\nof motion for the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice in the continuum\nlimit is a remarkable PDE called the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)\nequation [15], known in the study of water waves. The KdV\nequation for the evolution of a real-valued pulseqpt,zq as a\nfunction of timet and distancez is\nqz “ qqt ` qttt. (4)\nZabusky and Kruskal found that (4) has pulse-like (localized)\nsolutions whose shape is preserved (or varies periodically)\nduring propagation. Furthermore, they made the surprisingob-\nservation that when two such pulses are launched towards each\nother, despite their nonlinear interaction, they pass through\neach other without changing their shape. Zabusky and Kruskal\ncoined the termsolitonfor such solutions, in recognition of\ntheir particle-like properties [15].\nThe spectacular properties of these solutions greatly ex-\ncited the mathematics and physics communities and many\nresearchers started to study solitons. In a celebrated paper\n[16], Gardner, Greene, Kruskal and Miura uncovered some\nof the deep structure underlying the KdV equation which\nis responsible for solitons and their unusual properties. The\nauthors of [16] were studying the celebrated linear Schr¨ odinger\nequation from quantum mechanics, given by\nψzpt,zq “ ψttpt,zq ` gpt,zqψpt,zq, (5)\nwhere ψpt,zq is the wave-function andgpt,zq is an external\npotential. They found that if one takes the solutionqpt,zq of\nthe KdV equation (4) as the external potentialg in (5), then\nthe eigenvalues of the Schr¨ odinger operator\nH “ B2\nBt2 ` gpt,zq (6)\nremain invariant during the evolution inz! Based on this\ncritical observation, they developed a method to recover the\nexternal potentialgpt,zq “ qpt,zq by solving an inverse\nproblem for (5). The method analytically predicts soliton\nsolutions for the KdV equation, as observed earlier by Zabusky\nand Kruskal through numerical computations. They had in fact\nfound the IST for the special case of the KdV equation.\nIt was not immediately clear if the method developed in\n[16] could be generalized to other nonlinear PDEs, since it\nis not obvious if there exists a certain auxiliary operator,like\nthe Schr¨ odinger operatorH, whose eigenvalues are preserved\nduring the evolution. In a landmark paper published in 1968\n[17], Lax put the theory on a ﬁrm mathematical footing.\nIn particular, he established the mathematical relationship\nbetween the auxiliary operators with invariant eigenvalues\n(now called Lax pairs) and the original nonlinear equation.\nOnce a Lax pair for a nonlinear PDE is found, a method along\nthe lines of [16] can be applied to solve that PDE.\nShortly afterwards, in 1972, Zakharov and Shabat found a\nLax pair for the NLS equation in one spatial dimension [1],\nand thus established that this equation, too, could be solved in\nthe same manner. Details of this method for the NLS equation\nwere subsequently developed by Ablowitz and others (see\n[8] and references therein), who also referred to this scheme\nas the “nonlinear Fourier transform”. After these discoveries\nfrom the 1960s and 70s, research into solitons became an\nestablished area of research, lying at the intersection of applied\nmathematics and nonlinear physics.\nNonlinear PDEs solvable by the NFT are called integrable\nequations or exactly solvable models [18]. These are usually\nHamiltonian systems having an inﬁnite number of conserved\nquantities, and include the KdV , NLS, modiﬁed KdV , sine-\nGordon equations, and the Toda lattice, among others [8], [9].\nThese equations all exhibit similar properties, includingthe\nexistence of soliton solutions. The generation and processing\nof soliton signals, and the engineering of novel transmission\nsystems that support their propagation, is described in [19].\nIII. CANONICAL L AX FORM FOR E XACTLY SOLVABLE\nM ODELS\nA. Lax Pairs and Evolution Equations\nWe wish to consider linear differential operators whose\neigenvalues are invariant during an evolution [17]. More\nprecisely, we consider such operators deﬁned in terms of a\nsignalqpt,zq where the eigenvalues of the operator remain\nconstant even asq evolves (inz) according to some evolution\nequation.\nTo facilitate the discussion, it is useful to imagine a linear\noperator represented as a matrix; however, we must keep in\nmind that, when moving from ﬁnite-dimensional spaces to\ninﬁnite-dimensional spaces (ofe.g., functions and operators),\nsome results do not carry over necessarily. The relevant prop-\nerties of linear operators needed for this paper are reviewed\nin Appendix A.\nLet Lpzq be a square matrix whose entries are functions\nof z. Clearly, the eigenvalues of this matrix are in general\nfunctions ofz too. However, for some matrices, it might be\nthe case that while the entries of the matrix change withz, the\neigenvalues remain constant (independent ofz). Such a matrix,\nif diagonalizable, should be similar to a constant diagonal\nmatrixΛ , i.e., Lpzq “ GpzqΛ G´ 1pzq, for some similarity\ntransformationGpzq.\nThis idea generalizes to operators. LetH be a Hilbert space,\nletD be some domain that is dense inH, and letLpzq :\nD Ñ H be a family of bounded linear operators indexed by a\nparameterz [20]. If the eigenvalues ofLpzq do not depend on\nz, then we refer toLpzq as anisospectralfamily of operators.\nIf diagonalizable, it follows that for eachz, Lpzq is similar\nto a multiplication operatorΛ (the operator equivalent of a\ndiagonal matrix; see Appendix A),i.e.,Lpzq “ GpzqΛ G´ 1pzq,\nfor some operatorGpzq.\nAssuming thatLpzq varies smoothly withz, we can consider\nthe rate of the change (with respect toz) ofLpzq. We have\ndLpzq\ndz “ GzΛ G´ 1 ` GΛ\n`\n´G´ 1GzG´ 1˘\n“ GzG´ 1 `\nGΛ G´ 1˘\n´\n`\nGΛ G´ 1˘\nGzG´ 1\n“ MpzqLpzq ´ LpzqMpzq “ r M,Ls , (7)\nwhere Gz “ dGpzq{dz, M “ Gz G´ 1, and rM,Ls ∆“\nML´ LM is thecommutator bracket.

An isospectral ﬂow: the spectrum ofL is held invariant even as\nqpt, zq evolves.\ndiagonalizable isospectral operatorLpzq satisﬁes the differen-\ntial equation (7).\nConversely, supposeMpzq is given and the (unknown)\ndiagonalizable operatorLpzq evolves according to (7) with\ninitial conditionLp0q “ G0Λ 0G´ 1\n0 . LetGpzq be the (unique\ninvertible) solution toGz “ MG with Gp0q “ G0. One\ncan easily verify thatLpzq “ GpzqΛ 0Gpzq´ 1 satisﬁes (7).\nAssuming that the solution to a ﬁrst-order differential equation\nis unique [21], we see thatLpzq is an isospectral family.\nThe characterization of isospectral operators is therefore\nsummarized in the following lemma [17].\nLemma 1. LetLpzq be a diagonalizable operator. ThenLpzq\nis isospectral if and only if it satisﬁes\ndL\ndz “ r M,Ls, (8)\nfor some operatorM. IfLis self-adjoint (so thatLis unitarily\nequivalent to a multiplication operator,i.e.,L“ GΛ G˚ ), then\nM must be skew-Hermitian,i.e.,M˚ “ ´ M.\nProof: The proof was outlined above. The skew-\nHermitian property ofM can be shown by differentiating\nGG˚ “ I.\nIt is important to note thatL and M do not have to be\nindependent and can depend on a common parameter,e.g.,\na functionqpt,zq, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The isospectral\nproperty of the solution is unchanged. The commutator bracket\nrM,Ls in (8) can create nonlinear evolution equations for\nqpt,zq in the form\nBq\nBz “ Kpqq,\nwhere Kpqq is some, in general nonlinear, function ofqpt,zq\nand its time derivatives. An example of this is the KdV\nequation.\nExample 1 (KdV equation). Let D “ B\nBt denote the time-\nderivative operator, and letqpt,zq be a real-valued function.\nFinally, let\nL“ D2 ` q, and let\nM “ 3\n2 D3 ` 1\n2 pDq` qDq .\nThe Lax equationLz “ r M,Ls is easily simpliﬁed to\nqz ´ p qttt ` qqtq ` p some termsqD” 0,\nwhere 0 is the zero operator. The zero-order term of this\nequation as a polynomial inD, which must be zero, produces\nthe KdV equationqz “ qttt ` qqt. UsingpDkq˚ “ p´ 1qkD\n(provable by integration by parts), it is easy to see thatL\nand M are self-adjoint and skew-Hermitian, respectively, since\nthey are real-valued and involve even and odd powers ofD,\nrespectively. The eigenvalues ofL are thus preserved from\nLemma 1. Note that theLoperator in this example is precisely\nthe (linear) Schr¨ odinger operatorH given in (6).\nDeﬁnition 1.A pair of operatorsL and M, depending onz,\nare called a Lax pairpL,Mq if they satisfy the Lax equation\n(8). Following Lemma 1, the eigenvalues of theL operator\nare independent ofz.\nB. The Zero-Curvature Condition\nThe eigenvalues of the operatorL, which are constant in an\nisospectral ﬂow, are deﬁned via\nLv“ λv. (9)\nTaking thezderivative of (9) and using the Lax equationLz “\nrM,Ls, we obtainpL´ λIq p vz ´ Mvq “ 0. SinceL´ λI\nvanishes only on eigenvectors ofL, it must be thatvz ´ Mv is\nan element of the eigenspace,i.e.,vz ´Mv “ αGx,αP C, and\nxis a coordinate vector. The choice ofαdoes not inﬂuence the\nresults of future sections; thus for simplicity we setα“ 0. It\nfollows that an eigenvectorvpt,zq evolves based on the linear\nequation\nvz “ Mv. (10)\nFurthermore, it is often more convenient to re-write (9) as\nvt “ Pv, (11)\nfor some operatorP. The relationship betweenP and L can\nbe derived (if necessary) by combiningpDI´ Pq v“ 0 with\npL´ λIq v“ 0, obtaining\nP “ Σ pL´ λIq ` DI, (12)\nwhere Σ is some invertible operator, andD “ B\nBt as in\nExample 1.\nCombining equations (10) and (11) by using the equality\nof mixed derivatives,i.e., vtz “ vzt , the Lax equation (8) is\nreduced to thezero-curvature condition[9]\nPz ´ Mt ` r P,Ms “ 0. (13)\nNote that the nonlinear equation derived from (13) results as a\ncompatibility condition between the two linear equations (10)\nand (11). This shows that certain nonlinear equations possess\na “hidden linearity” in the form of (10) and (11).\nFollowing the work of Zakharov and Shabat on the NLS\nequation [1], Ablowitz et al. [22] suggested that for many\nequations of practical signiﬁcance, the operatorP can be ﬁxed\nas\nP “\nˆ\n´jλ r pt,zq\nspt,zq jλ\n˙\n, (14)\nwhere rpt,zq and spt,zq are functions—depending on\nqpt,zq—to be determined to produce a given nonlinear evolu-\ntion equation. From (12) this corresponds to theL operator\nL“ j\nˆ\nD ´rpt,zq\nspt,zq ´ D\n˙\n, (15)\nYOUSEFI AND KSCHISCHANG 5\nwith Σ “ diagpj,´jq. In this case, bothL and P operate on\n2 ˆ 1 vector functions.\nEquation (11), withP as in (14), is known as theAKNS\nsystem(after the authors of [22]) and is central in the study of\nthe nonlinear Fourier transform [9]. The important specialcase\nwhere rpt,zq “ qpt,zq and spt,zq “ ´ q˚ pt,zq is generally\nknown as theZakharov-Shabat system. We will refer to (9),\n(10) and (11) as theL-,M-, andP-equations, respectively.\nThroughout this paper, we will assume that the domain ofL,\nP, andM are subsets of the Hilbert spaceL2pRq, denoted here\nby H, depending on the particular structure of that operator.\nExample 2 (Sine-Gordon equations). Letrpt,zq “ ´ spt,zq “\n1\n2 qtpt,zq in (14) and let\nM “ j\n4λ\nˆ\ncospqq ´ sinpqq\n´ sinpqq ´ cospqq\n˙\n.\nThen the zero-curvature equation is simpliﬁed toqtz “ sinpqq.\nTakingr“ s“ 1\n2 qt and M as\nM “ j\n4λ\nˆ\ncoshpqq ´ sinhpqq\nsinhpqq ´ coshpqq\n˙\ngivesqtz “ sinhpqq.\nExample 3 (Nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation).

Obviously one can scaleL by a number, or add a\nconstantαI toLorM. In addition, both the Lax equation (8)\nand (9) are unchanged under orthogonal transformations,i.e.,\nreplacingL and M with Σ LΣ T and Σ MΣ T , respectively,\nwhere Σ is a (constant) orthogonal matrix,i.e., Σ T Σ “ I.\nNote further that it may be possible to choose two Lax pairs\npL1,M1q and pL2,M2q for a given equation such thatL1 is\nself-adjoint andL2 is not self-adjoint. The eigenvalues ofL1\nand L2 are, respectively, real and complex; see Appendix A.\nC.

The role ofz is therefore\njust a parameter and once ﬁxed (toz “ L), the system\nis described by an impulse response (or a Green function)\nhpt; Lq, representing the underlying (linear) convolution.\nFollowing this analogy, we wish to deﬁne a system in terms\nof a Lax pairpL,Mq. Here,L and M are parametrized by a\nwaveform qpt,zq. Such a system accepts a waveformxptq “\nqpt,0q at its input and produces a waveformyptq “ qpt,Lq\nat its output, according to the evolution equation induced by\nLz “ r M,Ls. The time-domain input-output map is thus\ngiven by an evolution equation of the formqz “ Kpqq,\nobtainable from the Lax equation (8) (or its equivalent (13)).\nWe refer to such a system as anintegrable system. Note that\nan integrable system is completely characterized by the two\noperatorspL,Mq and the parameterz“ L, independent of the\nsignals. We denote such a system using the triplepL,M; Lq.\nDeﬁnition 2(Lax convolution). We refer to the action of an\nintegrable systemS “ p L,M; Lq on the inputqpt,0q as the\nLax convolution ofq with S. We write the system output as\nqpt,Lq “ qpt,0q ˙ pL,M; Lq. See Fig. 2.\nDeﬁnition 3(Integrable communication channels). A wave-\nform communication channelC : xptq ˆ npt,zq Ñ yptq\nwith inputsxptq P L1pRq and space-time noisenpt,zq P\nL1pR,R` q, and outputyptq P L1pRq, is said to beintegrable\nif the noise-free channel is an integrable system.\nNote that noise can be introduced into an integrable system\nin a variety of ways. In the approach taken in these papers,\nwe assume that the signal-to-noise ratio is not too small, so\nthat the stochastic system may justiﬁably be considered as a\nperturbation of the deterministic system. Furthermore, welimit\nourselves to integrable channels with additive noise,i.e.,\nqz “ Kpqq ` npt,zq, q pt,0q “ xptq, q pt,Lq “ yptq,\nwhere npt,zq is distributed band-limited noise. Note that this\nmodel isnot in general equivalent to one in which noise is\nadded (in lumped fashion) at the channel output. Here, the\nnoise is distributed in space, and so interacts with the signal\n(in a potentially complicated manner) according to the given\nevolution equation.\nIn this paper, we develop a scheme for communication over\nintegrable channels. By various choices of Lax pairpL,Mq,\none can construct a variety of interesting channel models,\nmostly nonlinear, which go beyond the linear channel models\ntypically studied in data communications. Interestingly,some\nlinear channels can also be analyzed using this nonlinear\nspectral approach advocated here [23]. As noted in Section I,\nthe central application (and motivation) for this work is ﬁber-\noptic communication, in which the channel model is given by\nthe nonlinear Schr¨ odinger equation (2), and for which a Lax\n6 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY\npair was given in Example 3. In this paper we ﬁrst discuss\nthe deterministic (noise-free) case and later, in [Part III], treat\nnoise as a perturbation of the deterministic system.\nIV. NONLINEAR FOURIER TRANSFORM\nIn this section, we assume that a functionqpt,¨q is given,\nand we deﬁne its nonlinear Fourier transform with respect\nto the Lax operatorL (15). As the notationqpt,¨q implies,\nin this and the next section, the variablez can take on any\nvalue in the ranger0,Ls and is irrelevant in the forward and\ninverse transforms. We shall therefore omit the indexzin what\nfollows.\nAssumptions 1. We assume thatqptq satisﬁes:\n1) qptq P L1pRq;\n2) qptq Ñ 0 as |t| Ñ 8 .\nAs previously noted, for concreteness we carry through the\ndevelopment of the NFT for the case of the NLS equation (3),\nfor which theP-equation is the Zakharov-Shabat system\nvt “ Ppλ,qqv“\nˆ\n´jλ q ptq\n´q˚ ptq jλ\n˙\nv. (16)\nIf for a givenλP C the operatorL´ λI is not invertible,\nthen we say thatλ belongs to the spectrum ofL and vpt,λq\nrepresents its associated eigenvector. In ﬁnite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces of matrices the spectrum is a discrete ﬁnite\nset of eigenvalues. This may no longer be true in inﬁnite-\ndimensional spaces of operators, where the eigenvalues (ifthey\nexist) may only be one part of the spectrum. See Appendix A.\nThe nonlinear Fourier transform of a signalxptq with\nrespect to an operatorLin a Lax pair is deﬁned via the spectral\nanalysis of theL operator, which we consider next.\nA. Canonical Eigenvectors and Spectral Coefﬁcients\nWe wish to study solutions of (16), in which vectors\nvptq “ p v1ptq,v2ptqqT are considered as elements of the vector\nspaceH. We begin by equipping the vector spaceH with a\nsymplectic bilinear formH ˆ H ÞÑ C, which, for anyﬁxed\nvalue oftP R, is deﬁned as\nxvptq,wptqys “ v1ptqw2ptq ´ v2ptqw1ptq.\nLet us also deﬁne the adjoint of any vectorv in H as\n˜vptq “\nˆ\nv˚\n2 ptq\n´v˚\n1 ptq\n˙\n.\nThe following properties hold true for allv and w inH:\n‚ ˜\n˜v“ ´ v;\n‚ xv,vys “ 0;\n‚ xv,wys “ ´x w,vys;\n‚ x˜v,vys “ ´x v,˜vys “ | v1|2 ` | v2|2;\n‚ d\ndt xv,wys “ x vt,wys ` x v,wtys;\n‚ for every2 ˆ 2 matrix A, xAv,wys ` x v,Awys “\ntrpAqxv,wys.\nThere are generally inﬁnitely many solutionsv of (16)\nfor a givenλ P C, parametrized by the set of all possible\nboundary conditions. These solutions form a subspaceEλ\nof continuously differentiable2 ˆ 1 vector functions (an\neigenspace).\nLemma 2. For all vectorsvptq and wptq in Eλ,\n1) ˜vP Eλ˚ ,i.e., ˜vt “ Ppλ˚ ,qq˜v;\n2) xvptq,wptqys is a constant, independent oft;\n3) Ifxvptq,wptqys ‰ 0, thenv and w are linearly indepen-\ndent and form a basis forEλ;\n4) dimpEλq “ 2.\nProof: Property 1) follows directly from (16). To see 2),\nnote thatd\ndt xv,wys “ x vt,wys ` x v,wtys “ x Pv,w ys `\nxv,Pw ys “ trpPqxv,wys “ 0. To see 3), ﬁxt and let\nuptq P Eλ, then uptq “ aptqvptq ` bptqwptq for some\naptq and bptq. Taking the symplectic inner product of both\nsides withw and v, we get aptq “ x u,wys{xv,wys and\nbptq “ x u,vys{xw,vys. From Property 2,xu,wys, xv,wys,\nxu,vys, andxw,vys are all independent oft. It follows that\na and b are also independent oft. Finally, 4) follows from\n3).\nAn important conclusion of Lemma 2 is that any two\nlinearly independent solutionsu and w of (16) provide a\nbasis for the solution space. To choose two such solutions,\nwe examine the behavior of the equation at large values of|t|.\nBy Assumption 1.2, as|t| Ñ 8 (16) is reduced to\nvt Ñ\nˆ\n´jλ 0\n0 jλ\n˙\nv, for large|t|,\nwhich has a general solution\nvpt,λq Ñ\n`\nαe´ jλt ,βejλt˘T\n, α,β P C.\nTwo possible boundary conditions, bounded in the upper\nhalf complex planeC` “ t λ: ℑpλq ą 0u, are\nv1pt,λq Ñ\nˆ\n0\n1\n˙\nejλt, t Ñ `8 , (17a)\nv2pt,λq Ñ\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\ne´ jλt, t Ñ ´8 . (17b)\nWe solve (16) for a givenλ P C` under the boundary\nconditions (17a)–(17b), and denote the resulting solutions for\nallt P R as v1pt,λq and v2pt,λq. We can also solve (16)\nforλ˚ under the adjoint boundary conditions, bounded in the\nlower half complex planeC´ “ t λ: ℑpλq ă 0u,\nv1pt,λ˚ q Ñ\nˆ\n0\n1\n˙\nejλ˚ t, t Ñ `8 , (18a)\nv2pt,λ˚ q Ñ\nˆ\n´1\n0\n˙\ne´ jλ˚ t, t Ñ ´8 , (18b)\ngiving rise to two solutionsv1pt,λ˚ q and v2pt,λ˚ q. Taking\ntilde “„” operation, we obtain˜v1pt,λ˚ q and ˜v2pt,λ˚ q. From\nLemma 2 we have that˜v1pt,λ˚ q and ˜v2pt,λ˚ q are elements of\nEλ. These four eigenvectorsv1pt,λq,v2pt,λq, ˜v1pt,λ˚ q, and\n˜v2pt,λ˚ q, all of them elements ofEλ, are calledcanonical\neigenvectors. Fig. 3 illustrates the canonical eigenvectors at\ntheir boundaries.\nLemma 3.

A crucial property, following from Lemma 2, is that\napλq and bpλq are time-independent. The time-independent\ncomplex scalarsapλq and bpλq are called thenonlinear Fourier\ncoefﬁcients[8], [9].\nSince the nonlinear Fourier coefﬁcients are time indepen-\ndent, to facilitate computing them, for simplicity we can\nsend t to,e.g., `8 where v1p`8,λq and ˜v1p`8,λ˚ q are\nknown. The other two canonical eigenvectorsv2 and ˜v2 are\nthen propagated from their boundary valuesv2p´8,λq and\n˜v2p´8,λ˚ q at t “ ´8 according tov2\nt “ Ppλ,qqv2 and\n˜v2\nt “ Ppλ˚ ,qq˜v2 to obtainv2p8,λq and ˜v2p8,λ˚ q. At this\nstage, we have available all four canonical eigenvectors atone\ntime, namely,\n␣\nv2p`8,λq,˜v2p`8,λ˚ q,v1p`8,λq,˜v1p`8,λ˚ q\n(\n.\nWe can now project v2p`8,λq and ˜v2p`8,λ˚ q onto the\nbasisv1p`8,λq and ˜v1p`8,λ˚ q according to (19a)–(19b)\nto obtain\n`\nv2p`8,λq,˜v2p`8,λ˚ q\n˘\n“\n`\n˜v1p`8,λ˚ q,v1p`8,λq\n˘\nS,\n(20)\nwhere\nS “\nˆ\napλq ´ b˚ pλ˚ q\nbpλq a˚ pλ˚ q\n˙\n.\nThe matrixS is called the scattering matrix and contains\nthe nonlinear Fourier coefﬁcients [8], [9]. It is a functionof\nqpt,¨q and says how the solution to (16) is scattered from\nt “ ´8 to t “ `8 . More precisely, the ﬁeldv2p´8,λq “\np1,0qT e´ jλt is applied att “ ´8 , whereq is absent. This\nﬁeld evolves forward in time according to (16), interacts with\nthe signal (which can be viewed as an “obstacle”) at ﬁnite\nvalues oft, and subsequently propagates towardst “ `8 ,\nwhere againq is absent. The ﬁeld att“ `8 is measured and\ngives information about the “obstacle” as seen from a distance.\nAlthough not obvious from the development so far, we shall\nsee in Section VII that the information measured att“ `8 ,\ncaptured byapλq and bpλq, iscomplete, in the sense that from\nthis information we can retrieveqpt,¨q entirely. In view of this\ninterpretation, the nonlinear Fourier transform was historically\nreferred to as theinverse scattering transform.\nNote that, taking the determinant of the both sides of (20),\ndet S “ apλqa˚ pλ˚ q ` bpλqb˚ pλ˚ q “ 1.\nB. The Nonlinear Fourier Transform\nThe projection equations (19a) and (19b) that giveapλq and\nbpλq are well-deﬁned ifλP R. From Lemma 2, Property 1),\nwe observe that the eigenspace is symmetric inλ,i.e., ifλ is\nan eigenvalue then so isλ˚ . Thus it is sufﬁcient to consider\nthe upper half complex planeC` . In this region, the boundary\nconditions on the basis vectorsv1 and ˜v1 att“ 8 decay and\nblow up, respectively. As a result, (19a) is consistent inC`\nonly ifapλq “ 0. Eigenvalues inC` are therefore identiﬁed\nas the zeros of the complex functionapλq and they form the\ndiscrete (point) spectrum of the signal. We will see in the\nnext section that the discrete spectrum corresponds to soliton\npulses.\nLemma 4. Ifqptq P L1pRq,apλq is an analytic function ofλ\non C` .\nProof: From Lemma 5 in Section VII, ifqptq P L1pRq the\nscaled canonical eigenvectorsv1pt,λqe´ jλt and v2pt,λqejλt\nare analytic functions ofλ in C` . Since\napλq “ x v2,v1ys “ x v2ejλt,v1e´ jλtys,\nis a combination of two analytic functions inC` , it is analytic\nin the same region. (Note, however, thatbpλq, which is a\ncombination of functions analytic in disjoint regions inC, may\nnot be analytic in either of those regions.)\nA consequence of Lemma 4 is that the zeros ofapλq in\nC` are isolated points [24]. It follows that the Zakharov-\nShabat operator for the NLS equation has two types of spectra.\nThe discrete (or point) spectrum, which occurs inC` , is\ncharacterized by thoseλj P C` satisfying\napλj q “ 0, j“ 1,2,...,N.\nThe discrete spectrum corresponds to solitons, and in this case\n(19a) reduces to\nv2pt,λj q “ bpλj qv1pt,λj q.\nThe continuous spectrum, which in general includes the whole\nreal lineℑpλq “ 0, corresponds to the non-solitonic (or\nradiation) component of the signal. The continuous spectrum\nis the component of the NFT which corresponds to the\nordinary Fourier transform, whereas the discrete spectrum\nhas no analogue in linear systems theory. The reader is\nreferred to Appendix A for a number of examples illustrating\n8 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY\nvarious notions of the spectrum associated with bounded linear\noperators.\nTo distinguish between the discrete and continuous spectra,\nwe ﬁnd it convenient to refer to discrete spectral values ofλ\nusing the symbolλj (with a subscript). Continuous spectral\nvalues are denoted asλ(without a subscript). In general,λj P\nC` , whereasλP R.\nFor the purpose of developing the inverse transform, we ﬁnd\nit sufﬁcient to work with the ratios\nˆqpλq “ bpλq\napλq , ˜qpλj q “ bpλj q\naλpλj q ,\nwhere aλpλj q denotes the derivativedapλq{dλ|λ“ λj .\nWe can now formally deﬁne the nonlinear Fourier transform\nof a signal with respect to the Lax operatorL(15) as follows.\nDeﬁnition 4(Nonlinear Fourier transform [8], [10]). Let qptq\nbe a sufﬁciently smooth function satisfying Assumptions 1.\nThe nonlinear Fourier transform ofqptq with respect to the\nLax operatorL (15) consists of the continuous and discrete\nspectral functionsˆqpλq : R ÞÑ C and ˜qpλj q : C` ÞÑ C where\nˆqpλq “ bpλq\napλq , ˜qpλj q “ bpλj q\naλpλj q , j “ 1,2,...,N,\nin whichλj are the zeros ofapλq.

For\nconvenience, one can instead write an explicit differential\nequation forypt,λq “ p v2\n2 {v2\n1q expp´2jλtq:\ndypt,λq\ndt ` qptqe2jλt y2pt,λq ` q˚ ptqe´ 2jλt “ 0, (22)\n$\n&\n%yp´8,λq “ 0,\nand obtainˆqpλq “ limtÑ8 ypt,λq.\nAnalogously, following (21a), one can solve the second-\norder differential equation\nd2zpt,λq\ndt2 ´\nˆ\n2jλ` qt\nq\n˙ dzpt,λq\ndt ` | q|2zpt,λq “ 0, (23)\n$\n’\n&\n’\n%zp´8,λq “ 1, dzp´8,λq\ndt “ 0,\nand obtainapλq “ lim\ntÑ8\nzpt,λq.

By transforming\n(25), the evolution equation foru is asymptotically (att “\n`8) given by\nu2\nzp8,λ; zq “\nˆ\n0 0\n0 ´4jλ2z\n˙\nu2p8,λ; zq,\nwhich gives\nu2\n1p8,λ; zq “ u2\n1p8,λ; 0q,\nu2\n2p8,λ; zq “ u2\n2p8,λ; 0qe´ 4jλ2 z.\nUsing expressions (21a) and (21b) we obtain\napλ,zq “ lim\ntÑ8\nu2\n1pt,λ; zqejλt “ lim\ntÑ8\nu2\n1pt,λ; 0qejλt “ apλ,0q,\nbpλ,zq “ lim\ntÑ8\nu2\n2pt,λ; zqe´ jλt “ lim\ntÑ8\nu2\n2pt,λ; 0qe´ 4jλ2 ze´ jλt\n“ bpλ,0qe´ 4jλ2 z.\nIn turn, the nonlinear Fourier transform propagates according\nto\n{qpt,zqpλq “ e´ 4jλ2z {qpt,0qpλq,\nČqpt,zqpλj q “ e´ 4jλ2\nj z Čqpt,0qpλj q,\nλj pzq “ λj p0q, j “ 1,2,...,N. (26)\nNote that, sinceapλ,zq is preserved under the evolution (i.e.,\nis independent ofz), the number of the discrete eigenvalues—\nwhich are zeros ofapλq—is also preserved.\nIn summary, we see that the operation of the Lax convolu-\ntion in the nonlinear Fourier domain is described by a simple\nmultiplication (diagonal) operator, much in the same way that\nthe ordinary Fourier transform mapsyptq “ xptq ˙ hptq to\nYpωq “ Xpωq ¨ Hpωq.

A N A PPROACH TO C OMMUNICATION OVER\nINTEGRABLE C HANNELS\nSince the nonlinear Fourier transform of a signal is essen-\ntially preserved under Lax convolution, one can immediately\nconceive of a nonlinear analogue of orthogonal frequency-\ndivision multiplexing (OFDM) for communication over in-\ntegrable channels. We refer to this scheme as nonlinear\nfrequency-division multiplexing. In this scheme, the input-\noutput channel model is given by\nˆYpλq “ Hpλq ˆXpλq ` ˆZ,\n˜Ypλj q “ Hpλj q ˜Xpλj q ` ˜Zj,\nwhere ˆXpλq “ ˆqpλ,0q and ˜Xpλj q “ ˜qpλj ,0q are spectra at the\ninput of the channel,ˆYpλq “ ˆqpλ,zq and ˜Ypλj q “ ˜qpλj ,zq\nare spectra at the output of the channel, and the channel ﬁlter\nis\nHpλq “ e´ 4jλ2 z.\nHere ˆZ and ˜Zj are effective noise in the spectral domain.\nBandlimited Gaussian noise in the time domain generally\ntransforms to non-Gaussian noise in the spectral domain. The\nnoise variables affecting distinct eigenvalues are in general\ncorrelated and a function of the entire signal spectrum. Exact\nstatistical description of the noise in the spectral domainis in\ngeneral involved; however when noise is small a perturbation\napproach can easily be taken [Part III].\nThe proposed scheme consists of two steps.\n‚ The inverse nonlinear Fourier transform at the transmit-\nter (INFT).At the transmitter, information is encoded in\nthe nonlinear spectra of the signal according to a suitable\nconstellation on\n´\nˆXpλq, ˜Xpλj q\n¯\n. The time domain signal\nis generated by taking the inverse nonlinear Fourier\ntransform,\nqptq “ INFT\n´\nˆXpλq, ˜Xpλq\n¯\n,\nand is sent over the channel. (The INFT is described\nformally in the next section.)\n‚ The forward nonlinear Fourier transform at the receiver\n(NFT). At the receiver, the (forward) nonlinear Fourier\ntransform of the signal,\n´\nˆYpλq,˜Ypλq\n¯\n“ NFTpqpt,zqq\nis taken and the resulting spectra are compared against\nthe transmitted spectra according to some metric\nd\n´\nˆXpλq, ˜Xpλq; ˆYpλq, ˜Ypλq\n¯\n.\nAs qpt,0q propagates in a communication network modeled\nby a complicated integrable equation, it is signiﬁcantly dis-\ntorted and undergoes inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-\nchannel interference. In the spectral domain, in the absence\nof noise, all the nonlinear spectral components propagate\nindependent of each other and the channel is decomposed\ninto a number of linear parallel independent channels. By\ndiagonalizing the channel in this way, the deterministic ISI and\ninter-channel interference are removed in the spectral domain.\nIn this scheme, as in linear OFDM, communication ob-\njectives, such as constellation design, coding and modulation\nare entirely formulated in the spectral domain. All available\ndegrees-of-freedom,i.e.,tλj , ˜Xpλj q, ˆXpλqu can be generally\nmodulated. Time domain constraints can be translated to\nconstraints in the spectral domain. A power constraint, for\ninstance, can be exactly transformed to a power constraint in\nthe spectral domain with the help of the Parseval’s identity.\nA bandwidth limitation is not directly and simply expressed\nin the nonlinear spectral domain; however, it appears that the\nnonlinear spectrum of a signal bandlimited toW is indeed\nconﬁned, approximately, to a vertical strip in the real lineand\nthe upper half complex plane, with a width depending onW.\nFig. 5 illustrates the NFDM channel model that we use\nin this paper (and its subsequent parts) for data transmission\nover integrable channels such as optical ﬁbers. Although in\nthis paper we introduced the continuous-time NFT on the real\nlinetP R, for practical implementation the nonlinear Fourier\ntransform of discrete-time signals with periodic boundary\nconditions should be used; see [Part III] and references therein.\nYOUSEFI AND KSCHISCHANG 11\nFig. 5. Nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing systemarchitecture.\nVII. INVERSE N ONLINEAR FOURIER TRANSFORM\nIn this section, we describe the inverse nonlinear Fourier\ntransform, which is a method for recovering the signalqpt,¨q\nfrom its nonlinear Fourier transformp ˆqpλq,˜qpλj qq. This is the\nopposite of what was done in the Section IV, and it gives\nfurther important insight into how the NFT works. As in\nSection IV, the value ofz is irrelevant here and the index\nz is thus suppressed.\nA. Riemann-Hilbert Factorization\nIn the 1950s, before the publication of Gardner [16],\na method for retrieving the potentialqptq in the linear\nSchr¨ odinger equation from the knowledge of the scattering\nmatrixS was already known in quantum mechanics. It was\nlater realized that this method is an instance of aRiemann-\nHilbert problemin complex analysis [9], [10]. Alternatively,\nthe same task can be accomplished using theGelfand-Levitan\nmethod [9], a different approach developed earlier in the\ncontext of inverse problems for Sturm-Liouville differential\nequations. Although either of these methods can be used for\nsolving the inverse problem, in this paper we will use the\nRiemann-Hilbert method.\nTo begin, canonical eigenvectors can be found in two ways.\nOn the one hand, they are related toqptq through the Zakharov-\nShabat system (16). One can solve (16) to explicitly express\nthe canonical eigenvectors as a series involvingqptq. On the\nother hand, canonical eigenvectors are related to the nonlinear\nFourier transform via the projection equations (19a)–(19b).\nThe latter are two equations for four unknowns and in general\ncannot be solved. However, the unique properties of the\ncanonical eigenvectors, which are analytic in disjoint regions\nof the complex plane, will allow us to ﬁnd them in terms of the\nnonlinear Fourier transform. Note that this second derivation\ndoes not explicitly depend onqptq; however, by equating the\ncanonical eigenvectors obtained from these two derivations,\nwe can relate the signalqptq to its nonlinear Fourier transform\n(ˆqpλq,˜qpλj qq.\nWe ﬁnd it helpful to brieﬂy introduce the tool that we em-\nploy in this section, namely the Riemann-Hilbert factorization\nproblem in complex analysis.\nDeﬁnition 5(Riemann-Hilbert factorization). The Riemann-\nHilbert factorization problem consists of ﬁnding two complex\nfunctionsf´ pzq and f` pzq, respectively, analytic inside and\noutside of a closed contourC in the complex plane, such that\non C they satisfy the boundary conditionf` pzq “ gpzqf´ pzq\nfor some givengpzq.\nItgpzq satisﬁes a H¨ older condition, it is possible to ﬁnd\nbothf` pzq and f´ pzq everywhere in the complex plane from\nthe given boundary condition. In Appendix C, we provide a\nbrief overview of this problem and its solution. See [26] for\nmore discussion.\nB. The Inverse Transform\nThe inverse transform maps the two spectral functions\np ˆqpλq,˜qpλj qq to the signalqptq.\nAs noted, we need to express the canonical eigenvectors\nin terms of the nonlinear Fourier transform. Below we will\nﬁnd it more convenient to work with canonical eigenvectors\nsubject to ﬁxed boundary conditions. Scaling the canonical\neigenvectors as\nV1 “ v1e´ jλt, ˜V1pt,λ˚ q “ ˜v1pt,λ˚ qejλt ,\nV2 “ v2ejλt, ˜V2pt,λ˚ q “ ˜v2pt,λ˚ qe´ jλt, (27)\nthe projection equations (19a) and (19b) are transformed to\nV2pt,λq “ apλq ˜V1pt,λ˚ q ` bpλqe2jλt V1pt,λq, (28a)\n˜V2pt,λ˚ q “ ´ b˚ pλ˚ qe´ 2jλt ˜V1pt,λ˚ q ` a˚ pλ˚ qV1pt,λq.(28b)\nLemma 5.

By inspecting the Zakharov-Shabat system (16), it is\nshown in Appendix E that for|λ| \" 1\nV1pt,λq “\n¨\n˝\n1\n2jλ qptq\n1 ` 1\n2jλ\n8ş\nt\n|qptq|2dt\n˛\n‚` Opλ´ 2q. (31)\nIt now becomes easy to recover the signalqptq from the\nnonlinear Fourier transformp ˆqpλq,˜qpλj qq. EigenvectorV1 is\nrelated toqvia (31) for|λ| \" 1, and is related to the nonlinear\nFourier transform via (30b). Approximating1{pλ´ ζq and\n1{pλ´λiq by 1{λ`Opλ´ 2q in (30b) for|λ| \" 1 and comparing\nthe resultingV1\n1 with V1\n1 in (31), we obtain\nq˚ ptq “ 2j\nNÿ\ni“ 1\n˜qpλiqe2jλi tV1\n2 pt,λiq\n´ 1\nπ\n8ż\n´8\nˆqpλqe2jλt V1\n2 pt,λqdλ. (32)\nThis representsqptq as a function of the nonlinear Fourier\ntransform.\nIn summary, given p ˆqpλq,˜qpλj qq, we ﬁrst solve the\nRiemann-Hilbert system to ﬁnd the eigenvectorV1. For this\npurpose, one can discretize the system (30a)–(30d) and solve\na linear system of equations of the form\nAx“ b,\nfor appropriateA and b. This is done for each ﬁxedti to\ndetermine values ofVlpti,λq at all times. Then,V1\n2 , ˆq and ˜q\nare substituted in (32) to obtain the signalqptq.\nNote that this inverse transform is taken only once at the\ntransmitter to synthesize the desired pulse shapes. It is only\nthe forward transform which needs to be taken in real time at\nthe receiver.\nRemark 1. In this paper we ﬁxedLto be the AKNS operator\n(14). In general, howeverLneeds to have adequate analyticity\nproperties so that the inverse NFT can be carried out according\nto a Riemann-Hilbert factorization. Thus the existence of aLax\npair alone is not sufﬁcient for the NFT.\nThe mathematical tools developed in this paper are used in\nParts II and III of this paper to present further details pertaining\nthe application of the suggested scheme in data transmission\nover integrable channels.\nIn [Part II] numerical methods are suggested to compute\nthe nonlinear Fourier transform of a signal with respect to the\nAKNS Lax operator. We use the results of Parts I and II in\n[Part III] to study the NFT in the presence of the noise and\nillustrate the performance of the method in actual ﬁber-optic\nsystems.\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\nThe nonlinear Fourier transform of a signal with respect\nto an operatorL in a Lax pair consists of continuous and\ndiscrete spectral functionsˆxpλq and ˜xpλj q, obtainable by\nsolving the eigenproblem for theL operator. The NFT maps\na Lax convolution to a multiplication operator in the spectral\ndomain. Using the nonlinear Fourier transform, we propose a\ntransmission scheme for integrable channels, termed nonlinear\nfrequency-division multiplexing, in which the information in\nencoded in the nonlinear spectrum of the signal. The scheme\nis an extension of conventional OFDM to integrable channels\ngenerated by Lax pair operators. An example is the optical\nﬁber channel, in which signals propagate according to the non-\nlinear Schr¨ odinger equation. The class of integrable channels,\nthough nonlinear and often complicated, are somehow “linear\nin disguise,” and thus admit the proposed nonlinear frequency-\ndivision multiplexing transmission scheme.\nA PPENDIX A\nSPECTRUM OF B OUNDED L INEAR O PERATORS\nWhen moving from ﬁnite-dimensional spaces (ofe.g., ma-\ntrices) to inﬁnite-dimensional spaces (ofe.g., functions and\noperators), some results do not carry over necessarily. Here\nwe recall a few useful results in functional analysis [20].\nLet H be a Hilbert space, letD be a dense subset ofH,\nand letL: D Ñ H be an operator.\nDeﬁnition 6. The adjointof L is the operatorL˚ whose\ndomain D˚ consists of allψ P H for which there exists an\nelementL˚ ψP H such that\nxL˚ ψ,φy “ x ψ,Lφy, @φP D.\nThe operatorL is said to beself-adjointifD “ D˚ and\nL˚ “ L. Ignoring domain subtleties (as is the case for bounded\noperators), self-adjoint operators are the analogue of Hermitian\nmatrices.\nDeﬁnition 7.Given an operatorL on a Hilbert space, an\noperatorM is said to be the inverse ofL if the domain of\nM is the range ofL, the range ofM is the domain ofL, and\nML “ I and LM “ I.\nWe will restrict ourselves now to operators whoseD is the\nentire spaceH.\nAn operatorL: H Ñ H is invertible if it 1) is one-to-one 2)\nis onto 3) has bounded inverse. In ﬁnite-dimensional spaces,\nonly the ﬁrst condition is required.\nAn operator is bounded if it maps bounded inputs to\nbounded outputs. A bounded operator is invertible if it is one-\nto-one and onto.\nYOUSEFI AND KSCHISCHANG 13\nDeﬁnition 8.The spectrumof an operatorLon H is deﬁned\nas\nσpLq “\n␣\nλP C\nˇ\nˇ L´ λI is not invertible\n(\n.\nThe spectrum of a bounded operator can be partitioned into\ntwo classes, depending on the reason thatL´ λI fails to be\ninvertible.\nA complex number λ is considered part of thediscrete\nspectrumifL´ λI is not one-to-one,i.e.,Lψ“ λψhas a non-\nzero solutionψ P H. In this case,λ is called aneigenvalue,\nand each ψ satisfying this equation for the givenλ is an\nassociatedeigenvector. The set of all eigenvalues is called the\npoint spectrumor discrete spectrumof L,σdiscpLq.\nIt can also happen thatL´ λI fails to be surjective,i.e.,\nthe range ofL´ λI is a proper subset ofH. In this paper,\nwe call the set ofλ for which this happens thecontinuous\nspectrum σcontpLq [20]. Some authors subdivide what we\nrefer to as the continuous spectrum into further classes (e.g.,\nresidual spectrum, essential spectrum, etc.) [20]; however, for\nthe purposes of this paper, classiﬁcation into discrete and\ncontinuous spectra will sufﬁce.\nIn ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces the spectrum is entirely\ndiscrete. This may no longer be true in inﬁnite-dimensional\nspaces, where the eigenvalues (if they exist) may only be one\npart of the spectrum. The spectrum of a self-adjoint operator\nis real.\nThe following examples illustrate some of these possibili-\nties.\nExample 5. The operatorLpxptqq “ txptq, xptq P L2r0,1s,\nhas no eigenvalues and its spectrum is purely continuous\nσpLq “ r 0,1s.\nExample 6. The Fourier transform operatorFpqqpωq “\n8ş\n´8\nqptqejωt dt, regarded as on operator onL2pRq has the\npropertyF4 “ I. The eigenvalues are therefore the discrete\nvaluest˘1,˘ju. Ifpptq is an arbitrary polynomial, then\npptq expp´t2{2q is an eigenfunction.\nExample 7. Let ∇2 be the Laplace operator and letr denote\nthe radial distance in the three-dimensional space. The operator\nL “ ´ ∇2 ´ 1\nr is self-adjoint, and therefore it has a real\nspectrum. The continuous spectrum is [0,8) and the discrete\nspectrum is given byλn “ ´ α 1\nn2 , n “ 1,2,... , for some\nconstantα.\nExample 8. It is possible that the discrete spectrum of\nan operator is uncountable. For example, for a sequence\npx0,x1,... q P ℓ2 “ t x : ř\ni |xi|2 ă 8u , let the left-shift\noperatorL be deﬁned as Lpx0,x1,x2,... q “ p x1,x2,... q.\nThe spectrum consists of the unit disk|λ| ď 1. The portion\n|λ| ă 1 is the discrete spectrum while|λ| “ 1 is the contin-\nuous spectrum. The adjoint ofL is the right-shift operator\nRpx0,x1,x2,... q “ p 0,x0,x1,... q. This operator has the\nsame total spectrum, but it is entirely continuous.\nHermitian matrices are always diagonalizable, have real\neigenvalues, and possess a complete set of orthonormal eigen-\nvectors, which provide a basis for the input space. There is\na perfect generalization of this result tocompact self-adjoint\noperators [20].\nTheorem 6 (Hilbert-Schmidt spectral theorem). Let L be a\ncompact self-adjoint operator inH. Then it is always possible\nto ﬁnd eigenvectorstψnu ofL forming an orthonormal basis\nforH.\nThe spectral theory of operators that are not compact and\nself-adjoint is more involved; see [20].\nAn important class of operators are the multiplication op-\nerators, which are analogous to diagonal matrices.\nDeﬁnition 9(Multiplication operator). Letfptq be an arbitrary\nfunction. The operatorL deﬁned by pLf ψqptq “ fptqψptq,\nwhich performs sample-wise multiplication, is called themul-\ntiplication operatoror diagonal operatorinduced byfptq.\nTheorem 7. Every bounded self-adjoint operator in a separa-\nble Hilbert spaceH is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication\noperatorΓ ,i.e.,L“ UΓ U´ 1 where U is unitary.\nIt follows that the essence of a bounded self-adjoint operator\nis just a multiplication operator.\nA PPENDIX B\nPROOF OF E LEMENTARY PROPERTIES OF THE NFT\nIn this section, we sketch the proofs of the properties of the\nNFT stated in Section IV-D.\n1) If||qptq||L1 ! 1, theny2pt,λq and q2ptq terms can be\nignored in (22) and (23). From the resulting equations,\nit follows that there is no discrete spectrum andˆqpλq Ñ\nQpλq. The quadratic terms are introduced by the NFT\nto account for the nonlinearity.\n2) This follows from 1) in above, and that when|a| ! 1,\nthe squared terms representing the nonlinearity can be\nignored.\n3) This follows from replacingqptq with ejφqptq in (22)\nand (23).

For\na brief review, in this section we follow [27].\nThe following lemma is central in solving the simplest\nscalar RH factorization.\nLemma 8 (Sokhotski-Plemelj formulae). Let C be any\nsmooth, closed, counter-clockwise, contour in the complex\nplane and letfpxq be any function satisfying a H¨older\ncondition onC deﬁned by\n|fptq ´ fpτq| ď k|t´ τ|α, ką 0, @t,τ P C,\nfor some0 ă αď 1. Then the projection integral\nFpζq “ 1\n2πj\n¿\nC\nfpzq\nz´ ζdz (35)\nis analytic everywhere inC except possibly at pointsζ on the\ncontourC (where Fpζq is not deﬁned). Ifζ approachesC\nalong a path entirely inside the contourC, then\nF` pζq ∆“ lim\nzÑζ\nFpζq “ fpζq\n2 ` 1\n2πj p.v.\nż\nC\nfpzq\nz´ ζdz. (36)\nYOUSEFI AND KSCHISCHANG 15\nIfζ approachesC along a path entirely outside the contour\nC, then\nF´ pζq ∆“ lim\nzÑζ\nFpζq “ ´ fpζq\n2 ` 1\n2πj p.v.\nż\nC\nfpzq\nz´ ζdz. (37)\nHere p.v.denotes the principal value integral deﬁned by\np.v.\nż\nC\nfpzq\nz´ ζdz“ lim\nǫÑ0\n¿\nC´ Cǫ\nfpzq\nz´ ζdz,\nin whichCǫ is an inﬁnitesimal part ofC centered atz “ ζ\nand with length2ǫ.\nProof:See [26], [27].\nThe projected functionFpζq is asectionally analyticfunc-\ntion ofζ with respect toC,i.e., it is analytic in sectionsC`\n(the interior ofC) andC´ (the exterior ofC), and the limits\nF˘ pζq exist (as given by (36) and (37)).\nA consequence of Lemma 8 is that F˘ pζq satisfy the\nfollowingjump conditionon the boundaryC\nF` ptq ´ F´ ptq “ fptq.\nThe projection operator therefore produces functions which\nare analytic almost everywhere, except on a contour where it\nexperiences a jump in its limits.\nBoth unknownsf` pzq and f´ pzq in the scalar RH problem\ncan be determined from the single boundary equation (34),\nusing the projection operator (35). To see this, ﬁrst consider\nthe homogeneous case wherehptq “ 0. One can rewrite (34)\nas a jump condition\nlog f` pzq ´ log f´ pzq “ log gpzq, z P C.\nFunctionslog f` pzq and log f´ pzq can be viewed as portions\nof a single sectionally analytic functionlog fpzq which is\nanalytic inC` and C´ and on boundaryC its limits jump as\nlog gptq. In view of the projection operatorP (35), consider\nlog fpzq “ 1\n2πj\n¿\nC\nlog gpλq\nλ´ z dλ.\nIflog gptq satisﬁes a H¨ older condition onC, thenlog fpzq is\nanalytic strictly inside and outsideC. On C, we can deﬁne\nlog f` pzq and log f´ pzq, respectively, as equal to the limits\n(36) and (37). The function obtained in this way satisﬁes (34)\nand has the desired analyticity properties.\nNote however that, unlikegptq, log gptq in the integrand\nmay not satisfy a H¨ older condition. To resolve this issue,\nwe can multiply gptq by a decaying factor t´ k, for a\nsuitablek, to make t´ kgptq H¨ older, and obtainf` ptq “`\nt´ kgptq\n˘\nptkf´ pzqq. Therefore, deﬁning\nFpzq “ exp\n¨\n˝ 1\n2πj\n¿\nC\nlog λ´ kgpλq\nλ´ z dλ\n˛\n‚,\nwe have the following solution for the homogeneous RH\nproblem:\nf` pzq “\n#\nFpzq, z P C` ,\nF` pzq, z P C,\nand\nf´ pzq “\n#\nz´ kFpzq, z P C´ ,\nz´ kF´ pzq, z P C.\nHere k can be chosen so thatt´ kgptq is continuous and the\ntotal phase change oflog t´ kgptq is zero along the closed path\nC.\nThe solutionf˘ pzq is called the fundamental solution to\nthe scalar RH problem. From the homogeneity of (34), one\ncan obtain other solutions by multiplyingf˘ pzq by any entire\nfunction inC.\nWe can generalize the above procedure to solve the non-\nhomogeneous Riemann-Hilbert problem (34). In this case, we\ncan ﬁnd a factorizationgptq “ g` ptq{g´ ptq by solving a\nhomogeneous Riemann-Hilbert problem with boundary con-\nditionsg` ptq “ gptqg´ ptq. Then (34) is reduced to\nf` ptq\ng` ptq ´ f´ ptq\ng´ ptq “ hptq\ng` ptq ,\nwhich, as before, can be solved in closed form using the\nPlemelj formulae.\nB. The Matrix Riemann-Hilbert Problem\nWhen formulating the inverse nonlinear Fourier transform,\nwe face a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem (29). Matrix RH\nproblems are generally more involved and may not allow\nclosed-form solutions [26]. As we will see in the Appendix F,\nfor the particular matrix RH problem (29), the projection\noperator (35) is sufﬁcient to solve the problem.\nA PPENDIX D\nPROOF OF L EMMA 5\nAnalyticity of the canonical eigenvectors is directly a prop-\nerty of the Zakharov-Shabat system (16). A formal proof can\nbe found in [8], [28]; we simplify and outline it in this section\nfor the sake of completeness.\nConsider the scaled canonical eigenvectors (27). Transform-\ning the Zakharov-Shabat system (16), the scaled eigenvectors\nsatisfy\nV2\nt “\nˆ\n0 q\n´q˚ 2jλ\n˙\nV2, V 2p´8q“\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\n, (38)\n˜V2\nt “\nˆ\n´2jλ q\n´q˚ 0\n˙\n˜V2, ˜V2p´8q“\nˆ\n0\n1\n˙\n,\n˜V1\nt “\nˆ\n0 q\n´q˚ 2jλ\n˙\n˜V1, ˜V1p8q“\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\n,\nV1\nt “\nˆ\n´2jλ q\n´q˚ 0\n˙\nV1, V 1p8q“\nˆ\n0\n1\n˙\n.\nLet us, for instance, solve for the canonical eigenvectorV2\nin (38). Considering theqterms as an external force and using\nthe Duhamel’s formula [29], (38) can be transformed into its\nintegral representation\nV2pt,λq “\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\n`\n8ż\n´8\nhpt´ t1 ,λq\nˆ\n0 qpt1 q\n´q˚ pt1 q 0\n˙\nV2pt1 ,λqdt1 , (39)\n16 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY\nwhere the system “impulse response”hpt,λq is\nhpt,λq “\nˆ\nuptq 0\n0 e2jλtuptq\n˙\n, (40)\nwhere uptq is the step function and we have ignored transient\nterms since the boundary condition starts att“ ´8 .\nThe analyticity of eigenvectors can be seen intuitively at\nat this stage. The impulse response (40) involves the term\ne2jλtuptq and hence (38) is well deﬁned inC` ifqP L1pRq.\nThe impulse response for theV1 equation, by converting it\nto theV2 equation, involves´e´ 2jλtup´tq and hence it is\nbounded in the same region. The impulse response for˜V2 and\n˜V1 have terms proportional toe´ 2jλtuptq and ´e2jλtup´tq,\nrespectively, and therefore these eigenvectors are analytic in\nC´ forqP L1pRq.\nA more precise argument proceeds by solving (39) explic-\nitly. Duhamel’s integral (39) is of the form of a ﬁxed-point\nmap\nV2 “\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\n` TpV2q,\nwhere T is the linear operator underlying the integral term in\n(39).

Since, the series (41) is\nuniformly convergent ont,V2 is analytic inC` .\nSimilarly one proves the analyticity of the other canonical\neigenvectors in their corresponding region.\nA PPENDIX E\nA SYMPTOTIC FORM OF C ANONICAL E IGENVECTORS AND\nN ONLINEAR FOURIER C OEFFICIENTS WHEN |λ| \" 1\nIfλ P C` and |λ| \" 1, then 1\njpω´ 2λq “ ´ 1\n2jλ ` Opλ´ 2q\nand, taking the inverse Fourier transform, we can approximate\ne´ 2jλpt1´ tq upt´ t1q “ ´ 1\n2jλ δpt1 ´ tq ` Opλ´ 2q.

Following the discussion in the Appendix C, the\nresulting factorization problem can be solved in a simpliﬁed\nmanner via an appropriate contour integration.\nDividing both sides of the projection equations (19a)–(19b)\nby apλqpλ´ ζq, for parameterζ P C´ , and integrating on the\nreal axis´8 ă λă 8 , we obtain\n1\n2πj\n8ż\nλ“´8\nV2pt,λq\napλqpλ´ ζq dλ“ 1\n2πj\n8ż\nλ“´8\n˜V1pt,λ˚ q\nλ´ ζ dλ\n` 1\n2πj\n8ż\nλ“´8\nˆqpλqe2jλt V1pt,λq\nλ´ ζ dλ, (47)\nin which the integration is performed on the open pathz“ λ,\n´8 ă λă 8 .

The integration path´8 ă λă 8 can be closed in\nthe upper or lower half-planes. To compute the ﬁrst integral,\nwe close the path in the upper half-plane and denote the\nresulting closed contour byC`\n´ ζ , i.e., the upper half plane\nYOUSEFI AND KSCHISCHANG 17\nand excluding the singularityz“ ζ\n1\n2πj\n8ż\n´8\nV2pt,λq\napλqpλ´ ζq dλ\n“ 1\n2πj\n¿\nC`\n´ ζ\nV2pt,zq\napzqpz´ ζq dz´ lim\nRÑ8\n1\n2πj\nRejπ\nż\nRej0\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\napzqpz´ ζq dz\n“\nNÿ\ni“ 1\nV2pt,λj q\naλpλj qpλj ´ ζq ´ 1\n2\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\n“\nNÿ\ni“ 1\nbpλiqe2jλi tV1pt,λiq\naλpλiqpλi ´ ζq ´ 1\n2\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\n“\nNÿ\ni“ 1\n˜qpλiqe2jλi tV1pt,λiq\nλi ´ ζ ´ 1\n2\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\n, (48)\nwhere, in the second line, whenR Ñ 8 , we have used the\nasymptotic values (45) and (46) in Appendix E. Note that we\nassumed that eigenvaluesλj are allsimplezeros ofapλq,i.e.,\nno multiplicity.\nTo compute the second integral in (47), we close the inte-\ngration path in the lower half-plane and denote the resulting\nclosed contour byC´\n` ζ ,i.e., the lower half-plane and including\nthe singularityz“ ζ\n1\n2πj\n8ż\nλ“´8\n˜V1pt,λ˚ q\nλ´ ζ dλ“ 1\n2πj\n¿\nC´\n` ζ\n˜V1pt,z˚ q\nz´ ζ dz\n´ lim\nRÑ8\n1\n2πj\nRejπ\nż\nRej2π\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\nz´ ζdz “ ´ ˜V1pt,ζ˚ q ` 1\n2\nˆ\n1\n0\n˙\n.
