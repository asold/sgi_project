  "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> The increasing deployment of natural language processing models in critical domains necessitates addressing the issue of hallucinations, where generated outputs may be factually incorrect or nonsensical. The longchain approach, which involves an iterative refinement process, offers a novel and significant method to mitigate hallucinations by enhancing both the accuracy and coherence of model outputs. The methodology involved modifying the GPT-3 architecture to incorporate additional layers for intermediate evaluations and corrections, followed by rigorous training and evaluation using the MMLU dataset. Quantitative results demonstrated that the modified model significantly outperformed baseline models across various performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, logical coherence, and hallucination rate. Qualitative analysis further supported these findings, showcasing the practical benefits of the longchain approach in producing accurate and contextually relevant outputs. The study emphasizes the theoretical foundations of iterative learning and continuous improvement, providing a robust framework for enhancing the reliability of natural language processing models. The implications of the findings are substantial for applications in healthcare, legal advice, and education, where the generation of accurate and reliable text is paramount. By reducing hallucinations and improving coherence, the longchain approach contributes to the development of more trustworthy and effective language models.",
