It represents a strategic role in the availability and contribution of food needs \nin the face of a growing global population demand (i.e., 9.73 billion inhabitants by \n2050) (FAO, 2017; Said Mohamed et  al., 2021). It is necessary to optimise spatial and \ngeographical technologies to address the problems of food security, production and \nsustainable environmental response to the effects of global change. In this sense, it is worth \nanswering: How is geomatics supporting agricultural management activities at the dawn \nof the twenty-first century? Growing demographics and climate change are challenges that \n15277\nGeomatic tools used in the management of agricultural activities:…\naffect agricultural production, reflected in a possible global food crisis (Xia et al., 2022). \nWhat sustainable management of agriculture requires (Song et al., 2009). In other words, \nsubstantial improvements are required in the agricultural system with information on \nthe dynamics of soil properties and activities (e.g., treatments that maximise crop health \nand productivity) (Morrison-Whittle et  al., 2017), water (e.g., irrigation systems) (Zhuo \n& Hoekstra, 2017), crop (e.g., resource optimisation) (Zuo et al., 2021) and farmer (e.g., \nmonitoring of agricultural processes and practices). These activities must be linked to \nfulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-2, 6, 12, 13 and 15) (Naciones Unidas, \n2023).\nFurthermore, sustainable agricultural management involves obtaining information on \nurban–rural areas and spatial distribution of land use and land cover (LULC) (Ni et  al., \n2021). In this context, using geomatic tools is important for urban–rural planning and \nterritorial ordering, as they help in decision-making related to land tenure management, \nagricultural investment and tax collection (Shirzad et  al., 2022). The environmental \nevaluation mitigates losses due to pests and conserves biodiversity (El Hoummaidi et al., \n2021). Food security allows access and spatial detection of productive lands (Viana \net al., 2022). Moreover, in agricultural production, geomatics improves crop management \n(Karthikeyan et al., 2020).\nGeomatics is a multidisciplinary approach that manages, analyses and processes georef-\nerenced spatial and land surface data (Ajmar et al., 2015; Barrile et al., 2018; Gomarasca, \n2009; Kamel Boulos et al., 2001). Geomatics tools are important in geoscience, geographic \ninformation, spatial distribution and remote sensing technology. With prospective appli-\ncations in monitoring real-world scenarios (Jurado et  al., 2022). Furthermore, its use in \nmultidisciplinary research provides highly precise graphic, multi-temporal, geometric data \nthat generates thematic maps, improves information and contributes to decision-making. In \napplications of management practices agricultural, geomatics has evolved, as shown in the \ntimeline of Fig.  1. From the use of base cartography for crop identification and control in \nthe transition period of agricultural expansion (Anderson, 1990) to the use of Geographic \nFig. 1  Timeline of the relationship between geomatics and agricultural management\n15278 P . Escandón-Panchana et al.\nInformation System (GIS) tools to analyze and compare the dynamic conditions of crop-\nping systems and agricultural land management (Aguilar Rivera et  al., 2013; Reichert \net al., 1998; Stubert et al., 2020; Suresh & Sivasankar, 2014). Remote sensing (RS) com-\nplements the interrelation between environmental conservation and agricultural practices \n(Khawlie et al., 2002; Zini et al., 2002). Subsequently, other spatial tools appeared, such \nas satellite data and Global Positioning System (GPS) used for mapping, agricultural pro-\nductivity and irrigation efficiency (Banik et al., 2006; Konecny, 2002; Mena et al., 2007; \nRao, 2004). In the last decade, geomatic tools and techniques, such as photogrammetry \n(D’Urso & Marino, 2016), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (Costa et al., 2012), multi-\nspectral images, orthophotos and 3D reconstruction (Jurado et al., 2022; Tang et al., 2020), \nhave been used in agricultural management practices contributing to precision agriculture \nand geosystem mapping (Alves et al., 2011; Ballesteros et al., 2014; Bannari et al., 2021; \nJurado et al., 2018).\nA strategy that improves agricultural management in crop management is precision \nagriculture (PA) (Far & Rezaei-Moghaddam, 2018; Modica et  al., 2020). PA is a \nmanagement strategy based on information technology that uses advanced data analysis \ntechniques for decision-making, improves crop productivity and reduces environmental \nimpacts (Sishodia et  al., 2020). This strategy requires spatial information on crops and \nsoils to adapt agricultural techniques to the conditions of the territory (Bannari et  al., \n2021). It uses innovative sensors and methods such as photogrammetry, high-resolution \nRS, UAVs and multispectral sensors (Herrero-Huerta et  al., 2014; Jurado et  al., 2018). \nThese techniques base their importance on the management of spatial–temporal changes in \nagricultural processes reflected in the mapping (e.g., thematic maps) (Belcore et al., 2021), \nsuch as digitalisation of farms and cartography of pest infestation (Del-Campo-Sánchez \net al., 2019). In addition, mapping of small agricultural areas (Sedina, 2017), identification \nof abandoned agricultural lands (Hearn, 2021; Lasanta et  al., 2015) and suitable soils \nfor various crops (Dadhich et al., 2017) to improve the yield profitability of agricultural \nproduction, and preserve the environment (Raeva et  al., 2018). Agricultural mapping is \noriented to crops’ cartography based on classification methods. These methods consider \nthe level of data processing, multi-temporal, vegetation water content, types, distribution, \nplots and numbers of crops, which originates crop maps with very good classification \naccuracy (Gomarasca et al., 2019).\nIn addition, agricultural mapping highlights its importance in the planning and execut-\ning of agricultural systems based on plots with geographically referenced information on \nunique and well-defined territorial units, such as the agricultural cadastre of urban and \nrural areas (Tomić & Roić, 2018). An agricultural cadastre is a basic tool for agricultural \nmanagement (Hanus et al., 2018). To generate an agricultural cadastre, the information of \nthe owner farmer, surface area, crop type and parcels is relevant, providing cadastral maps \nwith crop delimitation functions and cadastral limits (Blanco et  al., 2019; Cay & Iscan, \n2011). In addition, it presents data such as records and property rights, land use, culti-\nvation, restrictions and responsibilities of farmers, which vary depending on the admin-\nistration and legal system of countries (Yìldiz et al., 2018). Technological advances (e.g., \nGPS, UAV and RS) and the availability of geographic information tools (e.g., GIS) provide \nopportunities for various cadastral applications such as monitoring agriculture in maize, \nrye and grassland through remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS). Furthermore, obtaining \nthematic cadastral maps of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), thermal \nand multispectral show the productivity of nutrients in the fields (Sedina, 2017). Another \ncadastral application is the territorial ordering of agricultural space affected by rapid \n15279\nGeomatic tools used in the management of agricultural activities:…\nurbanisation through GIS, textural characterisation and image segmentation for cadastral \nfiscal purposes of taxes applicable to any region (Ruiz-Lendínez, 2020).\nAlternatively, the functionality of GIS and its integration with other tools (e.g., RS and \nGPS), methods, models and technological techniques analyze the space–time of LULC \nby agricultural activity (AL-Taani et al., 2021; Pollino et al., 2021) through UAV images \n(Ballesteros et  al., 2014) and produces agricultural cadastral maps for decision-making \nrelated to land management (AL-Hameedawi et al., 2017; Herrera-Franco et al., 2022). In \naddition, it evaluates the impact of farming constructions in agroforestry landscapes (Cillis \net al., 2020) and manages resources in soils affected by salinity, degradation and shifting \nagriculture (Venkataratnam et al., 2002). It reduces the risk of groundwater contamination \nby controlling and managing agricultural anthropogenic contamination in watersheds (Bera \net al., 2021) and identifies and monitors agricultural protection sites to sustain the territory \n(Schaefer & Thinh, 2019).\nGeomatic tool applications have been used in different agricultural activities. For \nexample, in Andhra Pradesh (India), using RS and GIS techniques, they mapped coastal \nagricultural areas affected by sea level rise to propose mitigation plans associated with \nthe effects of climate change (Nageswara Rao et al., 2011). Rice cultivation systems were \nalso evaluated based on spatiotemporal maps of fertilisation patterns, yield and spatial \ninterpolation. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is an \nimportant indicator for determining the status of these crops (Pandey et al., 2015).\nIn Port Said Governorate (Egypt), they mapped the quality and characteristics of \nthe soil, using a GIS and RS platform to increase the precision of physiographic maps, \nachieving the potential suitability of crops (AbdelRahman & Arafat, 2020). In Karbala \nProvince (Iraq), the harvest quality of wheat crops was evaluated based on remote \nsensing indicators reflected in NDVI maps and the detection of changes in crops that \nrepresent agricultural areas and their quality (Sbahi et  al., 2021). Furthermore, in \nBoscoreale (Italy), they provided a botanical atlas that determines the morphological and \noenological characteristics of vineyards, using approximation photogrammetry and very \nhigh-resolution cameras to analyze the variations in size and shape of the grape (D’Urso \n& Marino, 2016). Another study examined agave crops in Mexico through UAV and \nphotogrammetric processing, differentiating agave plants from weeds and other elements. \nThese techniques and geomatic tools allowed control and monitoring of the crop (Calvario \net al., 2017). In the humor depression (Romania), they determined the quantity of alfalfa \nhay crops harvested in an agricultural area by acquiring images by UAV to increase the \nyield of these agricultural exploitations, reducing work times and eliminating weather \nrestrictions (Copăcean et al., 2020).\nGeomatic studies merge geomatic tools applied to agricultural processes with \nspace–time analysis for decision-making in agricultural management. Additionally, these \ncase studies show the feasibility of using geomatics tools to map agricultural areas, evaluate \ncropping systems, identify productive soils and contribute to sustainable food production. \nThis study complements research gaps in applying geomatic tools in agricultural mapping, \nagricultural LULC, agricultural cadastre, precision agriculture and watershed management. \nThis systematic study raises the research question: (1) How do geomatics tools strengthen \nagricultural management?, (2) What geomatics tools contribute to agricultural mapping \nand agricultural management?\nThe objective of this research is to analyze the state of knowledge of geomatics tools \nand their applications in agriculture through a systematic review of scientific documents \npublished in Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases and methodological approaches, \nhighlighting the use of geomatics in agricultural cartography for the evaluation of trends \n15280 P . Escandón-Panchana et al.\nin agricultural management. The rest of the study consists of Sect.  2, which shows the \nmethodological approach composed of three phases that denote the scientific basis of \nthe publications, analysis of scientific production, research topics, trends and systematic \nreview protocol. Section  3 presents the evolution of the themes, relationship-contribution \nof geomatics in the agricultural cadastre/cartography and the most used geomatic tools \nin various agricultural management activities. Section  4 discusses the application of \ngeomatics tools in agricultural management issues. Finally, Sect. 5 presents the conclusions \nand future research.\n2  Materials and methods\nThis analysis focuses on bibliometric applications and systematic review regarding the sci-\nentific publications of the Scopus and WoS databases, generated in scientific history, to \ndetect the main characteristics of geomatic applications for sustainable agriculture. Fig-\nure  2 presents the phases of the study: (i) scientific base of publications regarding geo-\nmatics and agricultural management, (ii) analysis of scientific production trends and (iii) \nsystematic review protocol.\n2.1   Scientific base of publications related to geomatics and agricultural \nmanagement\nIn agriculture, geomatics has been used for various processes such as the geographic \nlocation and distribution of crops (Escandón-Panchana et al., 2024; Kussul et al., 2015), \nthe improvement of agricultural practices that contribute to food security of the sectors \nand decision-making in agricultural management (Doumit, 2017; Uca Avci & Sunar, \n2015). In this context and considering the study’s research question, this phase carried \nout a bibliographic search on the Scopus and WoS platforms, indexed, multidisciplinary \nFig. 2  Phase diagram of methodology\n15281\nGeomatic tools used in the management of agricultural activities:…\nscientific databases, more complete with publication metadata and impact indicators \n(Mongeon & Paul-Hus, 2016; Pranckutė, 2021). The search considered the terms \n“geomatic” and “agriculture” based on the equation: TITLE-ABS-KEY [geomatic* AND \n(agricultural OR agriculture)]. This search was conducted in December 2022 and obtained \n276 records, Scopus (167) and WoS (109).\nAccording to the study focus, the Mendeley software exported the references to \nsystematise the information and continue with the inclusion and exclusion criteria \n(Bornmann & Haunschild, 2015; El Chami et al., 2020).\n3   Analysis of scientific production trends\nThis phase consists of a bibliometric analysis, which allows the exploration of the scientific \ncontribution, intellectual structure of the area of specific knowledge and the trends of this \nfield of research (Donthu et al., 2021; Ellegaard & Wallin, 2015). This section considered \nthree steps: (i) fusion of the databases (Scopus and WoS) from the search through the \nstatistical program RStudio, version R-4.1.2 (Guleria & Kaur, 2021; Martens et al., 2017). \nThis program allows statistical meta-analysis to be carried out through R packages or \ncodes (Forliano et al., 2021). Databases selected for their scientific standards are merged \nusing the “mergeDbSources” function due to metric support (Dzogbewu et al., 2023). (ii) \nCleaning of the database through filter tools and conditional formatting using the Microsoft \nExcel Office utility (Tsay & Yang, 2005; Van Nunen et al., 2018). This program finds and \neliminates duplicate records, obtaining relatively reasonable and accurate data (Zhong & \nLin, 2022). In addition, polynomial regression was used to evaluate the annual production \nof publications. (iii) Analysis of the conceptual structure through the Bibliometrix tool \nallowed the analysis of research trends in the field of study and the evolution of its themes \n(Derviş, 2020; Forliano et al., 2021). Bibliometrix is a tool that helps import bibliographic \ndata from databases for quantitative research analysis (Olaleye et  al., 2023). Build data \nmatrices and scientific maps for the analysis of themes over time.\n4   Systematic review protocol\nThis phase adapted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\nAnalyses (PRISMA) methodologies and bibliometric analysis to answer the research \nquestion of this study (Herrera-Franco et al., 2023; Page et al., 2021; Tricco et al., 2018). \nPRISMA is a methodological strategy that selects studies for systematic reviews and meta-\nanalysis and consists of various stages, such as developing eligibility criteria and obtaining \ndata synthesis (Girma & Kuma, 2022; Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2019). The systematic review \nhighlights three sections:\n1 Identification, obtained 276 documents from the merger of the Scopus and WoS \ndatabases. Subsequently, cleaning the database eliminated eight incomplete records \nand 86 duplicate documents (i.e., 94 documents deleted), obtaining 182 papers in this \nphase.\n2 Screening, this phase analyzed the full text of 182 documents. The inclusion criterion \nwas the use of geomatic tools in agricultural management. Furthermore, the exclusion \n15282 P . Escandón-Panchana et al.\ncriteria availability of records and research approach discarded 10 and 93 papers, \nrespectively (i.e., 103 documents excluded). A total of 79 articles remained for the \nsynthesis. The discarded documents were related to other research topics, such as \nhydrology, coastal flooding risks and drainage projects.\n3 This phase included 79 documents reviewed that were related to the subject of study, \nsuch as Agricultural Mapping (AM), Agricultural LULC (ALULC), Agricultural \nPrecision (PA), Agricultural Cadastre (AC) and Watershed Management (WM), all \nassociated with the application of geomatic tools. The documents were synthesised \nconsidering their important sections through the variables: year, author, objective, study \nvariables, design method, geomatic tools, statistical method, geomatic relationship and \nagricultural activity, sustainability and results. A narrative synthesis approach was \napplied to explain the results (Wood et al., 2016).\n5   Results\n5.1   Analysis of scientific production trends\nThe research associated with applying geomatics in agricultural management has increased \nin the last two decades. Figure  3 shows the number of publications per year, highlighting \nthe increase in documents in the last five years of scientific production. These events could \nbe related to the interest in the acquisition and management of spatial data by the agricul-\ntural sector, which proves to be a potential research topic. In addition, the total number of \ncitations reflects a variable increase in the last decade. It highlights a significant increase in \n2014 due to the latest advances in image processing applied to monitoring and mapping in \nvarious contexts. For example, In the United States and European Union countries such as \nFrance, UAV image processing using digital photogrammetry and automated dense image \nmatching techniques have been used for orthoimage production, map generation, and 3D \nbuilding modeling (Nex & Remondino, 2014). In Italy, multi-temporal image processing \nwas applied through a dense point cloud, mesh for creating orthomosaics and digital eleva-\ntion model (DEM) for mapping and monitoring in precision agriculture (Lambertini et al., \n2022). In addition, there are other recent advances in image processing using artificial \nFig. 3  Scientific production, citations and trend of publications related to geomatics and agricultural man-\nagement, period 1990–2022\n15283\nGeomatic tools used in the management of agricultural activities:…\nintelligence techniques such as machine and deep learning, support vector machine (SVM) \nand computer vision for the diagnosis of breast cancer (Sadoughi et al., 2018), improve-\nments in the industry related to sustainable food production (Kakani et  al., 2020) and \ndetection of defects on railway tracks (Wei et al., 2019).\n5.1.1  Evolution of themes\nThis analysis uses two-time intervals: 1990–2017 and 2018–2022. These intervals select \nthrough trial and error. Figure  4a shows the change in the terminology of some topics in \ntime intervals: geomatics incorporates GIS, land use incorporates agriculture and preci-\nsion agriculture includes photogrammetry. In the first period, a large part of the research \ncovers the management of activities related to agriculture, such as soil identification, use \nand cover of agricultural land, seasonality and monitoring of crops and land consolida-\ntion through geomatics as a tool for application, generating thematic maps and cartogra-\nphy of farmland. The second period presents the intensification of geomatic studies related \nto agricultural management practices such as suitability of farmland; precision agriculture \nbased on photogrammetry, orthophotos and multispectral images; agricultural land use and \nanthropic cover.\nAlso, Fig.  4b shows that the motor theme has a high degree of density and centrality \nwith articles associated with: “geomatic”, which includes GIS and remote sensing tools \nin evapotranspiration, groundwater and soil quality studies, “precision agriculture” with \ngeomatic techniques and tools such as UAV, computer vision, DEM and photogrammetry, \n“agriculture” and its applications in LULC, monitoring, planning and classification of \nagricultural soils; and “LiDAR” which includes subthemes of forestry studies, while the \nemerging issues focus on “pollution”, “land consolidation” and “rural development”. \nHowever, the niche theme presents “environment” as a topic of high development and \nits importance in studies related to hydrological and environmental models. Finally, the \nbasic issues of high relevance and low density are the themes based on “NDVI”, which \ndetermine changes in forest cover, water bodies and agricultural land.\nFig. 4  Strategic map. a Evolution of themes 1990–2022. b Diagram of density and centrality of topics. \nLULC land use and land cover, LiDAR light detection and ranging, GPS global positioning system, GIS \ngeographic information system, UAV unmanned aerial vehicle, DEM digital elevation model, NDVI nor -\nmalized difference vegetation index\n15284 P . Escandón-Panchana et al.\n5.2   Contribution of geomatic tools in managing the urban and rural agricultural \ncadastre\nGeomatic tools constitute technologies for mapping and monitoring agriculture without \nhaving contact with crops. Photogrammetric and cartographic techniques allow the \nintegration and manipulation of spatial, flexible and feasible databases for the planning \nof agricultural cadastre projects. Using satellite images contributes to the design \nof thematic maps, urban land use and cadastral survey (urban and rural). The GIS \napplication contributes to managing spatial data and property registration processes, \nproperty boundaries, cadastral parcels and land use rights on farmland. RS contributes \nto the identification, mapping, monitoring and spatiotemporal changes in the registry and \nproperty rights.\nIn urban agriculture cadastre planning, geomatics integrated road infrastructure, water \nmanagement, drainage, land reorganisation and improvement of the farm landscape. In \naddition, it improves working conditions in rural areas, rearrangement of rural settlements, \norganisation of stationary establishments (e.g., barn, hayloft, sandpit and stone yard) and \nmanagement of water resources.\nFigure 5 presents the important variables (1–11) that intervene in the urban and rural \nagricultural cadastre, with the most used geomatic tools (a–j) and their relevant processes. \nThis information contributes to the registration of agricultural properties, land tenure and \ntax collection that depend on the regulations of each country. In this context, geomatics \nidentifies and analyses the geosystems involved in the agricultural cadastre to contribute to \nfood production through arable land, increase livelihoods for rural areas through employ -\nment and efficient management strategies and sustainable farmland for food security.\nFig. 5  Contribution of geomatics in the urban and rural agricultural cadastre. GIS geographic information \nsystem, RPAS remotely piloted aircraft system, UAV unmanned aerial vehicle, GPS global positioning sys-\ntem, RS remote sensing, LiDAR light detection and ranging\n15285\nGeomatic tools used in the management of agricultural activities:…\nAccording to the studies analyzed in this review, there are three common types of cadas-\ntral survey: photogrammetric survey (PS) using remotely piloted aircraft systems, satellite \nsurvey (SS) and terrestrial survey (TS). Forty-five percent of the studies identify that PS \nthrough the use of UAV achieves a high potential in detecting urban and rural agricul-\ntural areas with positive impacts on spatial planning, territorial planning, tax collection, \nregistration of agricultural properties, food security and agricultural productivity. Thirty-\nfive percent determine that SS achieves acceptable precision through satellite images, with \npositive aspects in agri-environmental monitoring, classification and conservation of agri-\ncultural lands. In addition, 20% of the studies use TS for traditional agricultural practices. \nMost studies agree that the risk of PS and TS is related to limited access to agricultural \nland due to natural or anthropogenic activity. Furthermore, the risks of SS could be the \nresolution and availability of images.\nIn addition, geomatic tools have been applied in various urban and rural agricultural \ncadastre studies. For example, in Türkiye, Yìldiz et  al. (2018) recorded agricultural \nland based on the land management system (LAS) by generating spatial data with GPS \nand photogrammetry. For the acquisition of satellite images or orthophotographic maps, \ntopography used RS and GIS. This study classified agricultural land, property records \nof agricultural areas for rural agricultural cadastres, and implementation of agricultural \npolicies. Also, in Poland, Puniach et al. (2018) applied UAVs to update cadastral records \nof areas affected by agricultural landslides. UAV allowed for obtaining elevation models \nand orthophoto maps. Taszakowski et al. (2018) transformed the old Austrian urban and \nrural cadastre into a digital cadastral map through legal-geodetic processes. GIS allowed \nthe vectorisation and calibration of urban (buildings) and rural areas (agricultural plots).\n5.3   Geomatics–agriculture relationship\nThe nexus between geomatics and agriculture improves agricultural production yield, qual-\nity and estimation through technologies such as UAV images of different agricultural activ-\nities. In addition, this relationship highlights the importance of agricultural monitoring in \nFig. 6  Relationship between geomatics and agriculture\n15286 P . Escandón-Panchana et al.\ndeveloping smart agricultural systems, which implies pest management, fertilisation and \nirrigation implementation. Also, this duality provides a digital mapping of agricultural \nLULC, highlighting dominant crops and recession agriculture in various sectors. Geo-\nmatic-based agricultural mapping obtains accurate data on urban and rural agricultural \nareas using crop types and parcel concentration statistics. Figure  6 presents a scheme that \ncombines agricultural management activities (e.g., irrigation, planning of plots and soil \nsuitability) with agricultural mapping issues (e.g., crop seasonality, land consolidation and \nsoil zoning), which allows improvements in management and agricultural management \nplans that contribute to the management of decision makers.\n5.4   Descriptive analysis of the systematic review\nThe PRISMA method allowed the analysis of 79 documents related to case studies focused \non geomatic tools’ use in agricultural management. Figure  7 summarises the distribution \nof these studies into five themes with their respective number of documents (n) and pre-\ndominant variables related to the agricultural activities of the included studies. Agricultural \nmapping represents the topic with the largest number of case studies and associated vari-\nables, such as identifying farming areas and crops’ seasonality and vegetation.\nFig. 7  Main themes of agricultural management and related variables.

Table  1 presents the studies focused on \nagricultural cartography distributed by the scientific contribution of countries (according \nto the frequency of studies) with their respective geomatic tools and predominant statistical \nmethods such as regression analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and descriptive \nstatistics. In addition, it shows the types of frequent crops. It highlights sustainability practices \nin various countries, focused on the SDGs (2, 6, 12, 13, 15).\nAgricultural LULC (ALULC)\nThis theme comprises 16 studies that use RS and GIS geomatic tools to analyze LULC \nby agricultural activity. In addition, a study used a multispectral camera for the classification \nof agricultural characteristics of crops.

And in WM studies, \nIndia uses 75% of geomatic tools.

It focuses on innovative results such as precision, spatial \nresolution and image processing in geospatial detection of crop areas, mapping, intelligent \nmonitoring, agricultural property management, property boundary accuracy and cadastral \nparcels. Furthermore, these geomatic tools are essential for agricultural territorial planning \nand management activities. They allow farmers to obtain relevant information about areas \nand spatial distribution of crops necessary for decision-making within the framework of \nterritorial-economic-agricultural-environmental development.\nThe application of geomatics in agriculture supports the use of GIS in topics of interest \nassociated with agricultural management (Fig.  3a) (Pouliot et al., 1994; Viau et al., 2000). \nCountries such as Italy, Iraq, Spain and Brazil have more frequently used GIS and other \ngeomatic tools (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel satellites, airborne remote sensing, UAV, \nGPS, RPAS and multispectral sensors) in AM studies, which explore vegetation for crop \nquality assessment (Belcore et  al., 2021; Jurado et  al., 2018; Sbahi et  al., 2021; Sedina, \n2017) and detection of pest infestation level (Del-Campo-Sánchez et  al., 2019). These \nstudies obtained high crop precision, optimal routes, strategic irrigation points, agricultural \nintervention areas and time–cost savings in agri-environmental activities. Similarly, other \nstudies in India and Egypt used GIS, Landsat satellites, and the Shuttle Radar Topography \nMission (SRTM) in AM associated with soil suitability to identify suitable crop areas and \nprovide farmers with planning strategies (AbdelRahman & Arafat, 2020; AbdelRahman \nFig. 8  Quantitative synthesis of the systematic review. a agricultural mapping (AM), b use and cover of \nagricultural land (ALULC), c precision agricultural (PA), d agricultural cadastre (AC) and e watershed \nmanagement (WM)\n15298 P . Escandón-Panchana et al.\net  al., 2022b, 2022c; Dadhich et  al., 2017). These studies achieved high precision in \nestimating biomass and soil suitability for crops (i.e., approximately 66% suitable soils), in \ncontrast to moderate global soil degradation (44%) due to soil salinisation, compaction and \nchemical contamination (FAO, 2023b). On the contrary, other studies in Canada and Chile \nused GPS and satellites (e.g., LIS II-III and NOAA) in AM linked to crop seasonality to \ndetermine patterns and dynamics of agricultural productivity (Blanco et al., 2019; Pandey \net  al., 2015; Viau et  al., 2000). These studies obtained agrometeorological prediction \nmechanisms against the impacts of climate change.\nAdditionally, applying geomatics in AM through multispectral satellite images obtains \nthematic maps for detailed analysis of viticultural and crop yields (e.g., olive, citrus and \nblueberry) (Costantini et al., 2016; D’Urso & Marino, 2016; Retamales et al., 2015). On \nthe contrary, other studies use the textural characterisation and segmentation of aerial \nimages for the detection, automatic counting and quality of crops (e.g., grain such as wheat, \ncorn, rice and barley; vegetables such as onion, potato and garlic; fruits such as coconut), \nin urban and rural areas (Al Waeli et  al., 2021; Ballesteros et  al., 2014, 2018; Calvario \net  al., 2020; Moll & Wouters, 2001; Ribeiro-Gomes et  al., 2016; Ruiz-Lendínez, 2020). \nAlso, some studies related to AM denote that applying geomatics in agriculture promotes \nsustainability improvements in agricultural management, such as agricultural restoration \nthrough crop rotation techniques for barns that store seeds, food (Mballo et  al., 2021), \nfarming projects that offer opportunities to work and improve environmental conditions in \nthe region (Al Waeli et al., 2021; Ghaderi et al., 2020; Gitinavard et al., 2021).\nRegarding the studies related to ALULC, in Cuba, Mexico and Mozambique, they \napplied GPS, satellites (e.g., SPOT, MODIS Terra and Aqua), and multispectral cameras \nfor agricultural management and evaluation of impacts on local agroecosystems (Moreno \net  al., 2021; Pollino et  al., 2021; Silva et  al., 2018). These studies obtained changes in \nland use due to anthropic activities, urban expansion and forest-agricultural-pasture cover. \nSimilarly, other studies in countries such as Romania and India applied geomatics (GIS, \nLandsat 8 satellites and geomatics software) in the identification and spatial representation \nof arable land, forests and grasslands, with sustainable practices that identify areas of water \nscarcity to establish action plans with sustainable crop patterns (Ramadasa et  al., 2022; \nSimon, 2017). According to FAO (2023a), these action plans must integrate technology, \nresearch and development with local knowledge to obtain adequate statistics; geospatial \nmaps focused on the agricultural production system. In addition, studies associated with \nALULC prioritise the distribution and extent of agricultural areas with pasture crops \n(Mouafo et al., 2002; Vannier, 2012) and grain (e.g., maize, beans and rice) (Arowolo & \nDeng, 2018).\nStudies related to PA in countries such as the Czech Republic, Spain and Morocco used \ngeomatic tools (RS, GPS, UAV and GIS) and photogrammetry in precision agriculture to \nimprove agricultural yield and crop monitoring (Bannari et al., 2021; Chiappini et al., 2020; \nLambertini et al., 2022; Musci & Dabove, 2020; Orsini et al., 2019; Raeva et al., 2018). \nThese studies managed to reveal the texture and relief characteristics of the agricultural \nland for the fertilisation of crops. On the contrary, studies in Italy integrated geomatic tools \nfor intelligent pest management agricultural management systems (Chiappini et al., 2020; \nMusci & Dabove, 2020).\nFew studies relate CA to geomatic tools (use of DEM, GIS and LiDAR) in countries \nsuch as France, Turkey and Italy. These studies analyzed the connection between parcels \nin agricultural land reallocation projects, achieving greater parcel concentration, with \nsustainable practices such as detecting grasslands for livestock that contribute to the \nfarm space’s conservation of flora and fauna (Cay & Iscan, 2011; Lagacherie et al., 2022; \n15299\nGeomatic tools used in the management of agricultural activities:…\nSimon et al., 2021; Zini et al., 2002). Other studies integrate CA and agricultural mapping \nusing geomatic tools such as RS, GIS, UAV, and GPS measurements for cadastral registry \nassignment, identification and plot boundaries, calculation of agricultural properties, \nimprovements to agricultural management, and agricultural landscape spatial discretisation \n(Cay et al., 2004; Lagacherie et al., 2022; Modica et al., 2020; Vannier, 2012). In addition, \nsome studies extract topographic-cadastral data of farm areas to evaluate their agricultural \nperformance, establish agrotourism development strategies (Lambertini et al., 2022; Simon \net al., 2021) and control agro-environmental regulations for sustainable agriculture (Zini \net al., 2002).\nWM-related studies in countries such as Tunisia, India and France integrate geomatic \ntools with geographic databases and create agricultural GIS to improve the management \nand planning of irrigation water, watersheds and natural resources (Grimene et al., 2022; \nNaboureh et al., 2021; Pouliot et al., 1994; Ramachandran & Ramakrishna, 2006).\nRecent studies focus on technological advances in the use of the spectroradiometer, \nmulti-copter drones, autonomous tractors, multispectral topographic cameras, sensors, \nsatellites for spatial distribution and recognition of phenological stages of crops, \ngeoreferenced surveys in precision agriculture, areas suitable for cultivation, optimisation \nagricultural production and sustainable soil management (AbdelRahman et  al., 2022a, \n2022b, 2022c, 2022d; AbdelRahman et  al., 2022a, 2022b, 2022c, 2022d; Barrile et  al., \n2018; Olvera-Vargas et al., 2022).\nFinally, agricultural management has emerged with the development of geomatic tools. \nIt implies high performance through information management practices, which contributes \nto decision-making and the ability to manage sustainable agricultural processes (Kim et al., \n2023).\n8  Conclusions\nThe studies analyzed within the framework of geomatics tools in agricultural management \ncover statistical methods such as exploratory analysis, regression, descriptive statistics and \nprincipal component analysis, with precise and reliable results in agricultural planning \nprocesses. Sixty-percentage of the studies analyzed with PRISMA are related to geomatics \nand agricultural cartography, specifically in agricultural activities such as identification, \nsuitability, seasonality, pedology and monitoring of agricultural areas. GIS, GPS, UAV \nand RS are the most used geomatics tools in agricultural mapping. The predominant \ngeomatic techniques are photogrammetry in the phenology of crops such as grapes and \nolive trees and multispectral analysis in optimising and monitoring agricultural production. \nFurthermore, the most frequent tool in the application of agricultural management \nactivities is GIS.\n29.3% of the studies analyzed highlight the improvement of agricultural management \nthrough the application of geomatics tools in the spatial resolution/precision and processing \nof satellite images (e.g., Sentinel-2), demonstrating effectiveness in the measurement \nof various properties of crops-water-soil. Geomatics allows the production of thematic \nmaps related to identifying, classifying, yielding, spatial distribution and monitoring crop \ngrowth. Also, it is of great help to farmers in automating agricultural practices such as \nthe identification of pests, diseases and strategic irrigation points. It is crucial to optimise \nplanting and harvesting routes for grains such as wheat and maise in Mexico and France; \nvegetables such as onion and potato in Spain and Netherlands; fruits such as grapes and \n15300 P . Escandón-Panchana et al.\nolive trees in Italy, Chile and Spain; and coconut in India. Geomatics contributes to saving \ntime and costs in agro-environmental activities. In addition, it strengthens the agricultural \ncadastre by digitising and processing data/images at the parcel scale in various planning \nand decision-making processes in the urban–rural sphere. In this context, countries \nin Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America use geomatics tools to identify, register and \nmanage agricultural properties, land tenure security, land value and taxes for innovative \ncrop management approaches. Also, the dynamics of changes in LULC due to agricultural \nactivity in communes and urban sectors require that territorial policies consider the \nagricultural cadastre for the local development of the sectors.\nThis study demonstrates that the application of geomatics promotes sustainability \npractices in agriculture. They are focused on less use of fertilisers and pesticides to \nimprove food security (SDG-2) and prevent the effects of climate change (SDG-13). They \nalso include the efficient use of water resources for agricultural irrigation (SDG-6) and the \nrehabilitation of degraded soils (SDG-15). Furthermore, it highlights that improvements in \nthe agricultural system in rural and urban areas increase the quantity and quality of local \nproduction, generating employment and economic development in these sectors (SDG-12). \nThe study’s limitations are based on the number of publications associated with geomatic \nduality and agricultural cartography, according to the topics addressed in agricultural \nmanagement. Therefore, research in the areas of systematic reviews is relevant:\n• Systematic reviews aimed at sustainability practices in the relationship between \ngeomatics and agriculture with specific data from successful case studies.\n• Spatiotemporal analysis through GIS and artificial intelligence techniques such as deep \nlearning to understand the evolution of potential agricultural production areas and their \nfuture behavior.\n• Intelligent monitoring using geomatics tools, genetic algorithms and the Internet of \nThings (IoT) to improve agricultural practices focused on food production.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank the Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingenieros en Topography, Geod-\nesy y Cartography for managing the study activities.\nAuthors’ contributions PEP, the first author, wrote the original draft, collected, validated and analyzed the \ndata, designed the methodology and revisions and, in addition, contributed to the conceptualisation and \ncuration of data.
