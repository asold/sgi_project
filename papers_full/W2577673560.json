    "abstract": "NC controllers use different types of compensation systems to improve motion accuracy of feed drive systems against pitch error, friction, backlash, and elastic deformation. Compensators for static error, such as pitch and squareness errors, are tuned semiautomatically. However, for dynamic error such as quadrant glitches and vibration, parameter tuning takes too much time. In this study, motion trajectory measurement for parameter tuning using accelerometers has been proposed. In the methods, displacements of each axis can be obtained from measured accelerations along each axis. Although the obtained displacements include some errors, such as setting error, sensitivity error, and integral error in numerical integration, the errors can be compensated for based on the feedback positions measured simultaneously. To confirm the feasibility of the proposed methods, measurement tests using a grid encoder are carried out. Results of the measurements confirm that the circular trajectories and vibrations can be measured by the proposed method. Automatic parameter tuning method for the backlash compensator is also proposed.",
