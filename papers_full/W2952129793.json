INTRODUCTION \nHE CONTINUOUS increase in the world population \nleads to an increase in energy demand. That means an \nadditional capacity increase for those existing i n electrical \npower systems. One of the most important parts of the energy \ntransmission and distribution ring is oil filled transformer and \naffected by these capacity increase [1 -3]. For this reason, it is \nvery important to monitor the load conditions and o perational \nperformance of the transformers [4,5]. Also, demand for smart \ngrid applications is increasing all over the world with the \ntechnological development [6 -8]. Since the monitoring \ntechnologies are a sector with high R&D investments, the \ncosts of the  technologies produced are quite high [9 -12].

Although low-cost applications are limited in the \nliterature, they have become popular. These applications are \ngenerally focused on monitoring technologies. It is very \nlimited in terms of intervention, diagnostics or recognition. In \na similar application, the current, voltage  parameters for the \ndistribution transformers were monitored by the ThingSpeak \nweb interface [ 15]. In another study, the data were monitored \nusing the low cost ESP8266 wireless module and Arduino \nUno microcontroller [16] \nIn this study, it is aimed to devel op a low cost and open \nsource monitoring system that can be an alternative to high \ncost monitoring systems in the literature. The main advantage \nof using the open source software of the monitoring system is \nthat it allows the user to modify and improve the  system \nsoftware. Developed  system is based on Internet of Things \n(IoT) and is intended to perform the tasks defined in the \nelectronic card. The open source Arduino Mega 2560 \nmicrocontroller developed by Atmel has been used in the \ntransformer monitoring sy stem. The Arduino development \nenvironment (IDE) is based on \"Processing\" and the Arduino \nprogramming language is based on \"Wiring\". The data \nreceived from the sensors on the transformer can be stored in \nthe monitoring system and/or can be sent to the cloud  system. \nAlso, this data can be monitored via user -defined computers, \ntablets and phones. The monitoring system gives warning and \ninforms the operator when the safe operating limit values are \nexceeded. These limit values, which are defined as default in \naccordance with the standard, can be easily updated on \nsoftware in accordance with the information and approval of \nthe operator. There are input modules for sensors on the board \nas well as output modules that can perform different tasks.  \nIn this paper, the c omponents of transformer monitoring \nsystem have been defined at section 2; the ThingSpeak web \ninterface integration has been introduced used for the \nmonitoring system at section 3, the PushingBox Notification \napplication has been described at section 4, Th e details of the \naging and lifecycle monitoring have been presented at section \n5, and the final section contains the conclusions and \nrecommendations, respectively. \nII. TRANSFORMER MONITORING SYSTEM DESIGN \nWhile designing the monitoring system, it has been aime d to \nbe fulfilling five key functions.

Secondly, it should be \npossible to save this data both on its own system and on the \ncloud system. Thirdly, it should be ensured that analytical \nprocedures can be performed on the system and the limit \nvalues related to the measured quantities are identifiable. \nFourthly, in case of exceeding the limit values specified by the \noperator, he / sh e must fulfil the warning / information tasks \nand activate the pre -defined output relays.

Many parameters with standard \nsensor signals such as temperature (ambient, oil and hot -spot), \ncurrent / voltage, insulation fluid level and so on can be \ndefined as input. In this study, the temperature values at \ndifferent points have been obtain ed by different sensors. The \nbest measurement for hot -spot is done with fiber-optic sensors \n[18,19]. However, it is still a disadvantaged option considering \nthe cost -benefit relationship [20 ]. Therefore, K type \nthermocouple with a precision of 0.25 degrees  Celsius and \nrapid response time has been preferred for acquiring the \ntemperature data from hot-spot. The digital temperature sensor \nDS18B20, manufactured by Dallas, has been used for oil and \noil. This sensor is a very good option for its compatibility wit h \nthe microcontroller, its ease of use and its resolution of up to \n12 bits. The DHT11 digital sensor is used to measure the \nambient temperature. This sensor which is capable of \nmeasuring with a resolution of 8 bits by 2% error margin \nbetween 0 -50 degrees C elsius has been preferred because of \nits low cost and it can also receive the ambient humidity data \noptionally. A magnetic float level sensor has been used to \nmeasure the oil level. It has been made of heat -resistant \nstainless steel that producing an analo gue output of 0 -5V. As \nthe current sensor, the non -invasive AC SCT -013 model, \nwhich was developed by YHDC, has been preferred. This \nsensor output is between 0 -50 mA and can be used to measure \nAC currents up to a maximum of 100 A. In addition to being \ncompatible with microcontroller, it provides ease of use thanks \nto its clamp structure. A simple RC filter has been added to the \nsensor output in order to provide accurate values for the \nmeasurement results against external interference  [21].  \n \n \n \n \nSD KART \nMODULE \nRTC \nMODULE \nARDUİNO MEGA 2560 \nMICROCONTROLLER \nDHT11 TEMP \nSENSOR MODULE \nESP8266 -07 \nWI-FI \nMODULE \nPOWER \nSUPPLY \n(5V,12V) \n4-20mA  // 0 -5V \nMODULE \nTERMOKUPL \nMODULE \nROLEY \nMODULE \nSENSOR AND MODULE CONNECTIONS \nFUSE \n \n   \n \nFig. 3.

In order to integrate sensors with a 4 -20mA \noutput to the monitoring system, an analogue transducer \nmodule from 0 to 5V has been used.  \nThe mini SD card module has been used with the RTC -\nDS3231 module in order to store the data received from the \ntransformer with date and time information. The RTC -DS3231 \nmodule supports the I2C communication protocol. The \nESP8266-07 series has been chosen as a Wi -Fi module for \nwireless transmission of sensor data to the cloud. This module \nhas low power consumption and low cost. It also has a built -in \nantenna and support s the TCP / IP protocol. With this module \nthat supports the Internet of Things (IOT), the data received \nfrom the sensors have been easily transferred to the \nThingSpeak web interface. Also, the measured parameters of \nthe transformer can be monitored on the panel of the system \nwith the 20x4 LCD display. Yellow and red led, which are \nactivated in early warning and emergency situations, have \nbeen used on the panel. In similar emergency situations, the \noutput relays on the panel are also activated in order to \nperform the functions previously defined by the operator \naccording to the limit values. In the monitoring system, 50W \nswitching power supply with 5V and 12V output and a fuse \nfor system safety have been used. The inside of the completed \npanel of the monitoring system has been shown in the Fig . 3.   \nIII. THE THINGSPEAK WEB INTERFACE \nIn recent two decades,  with the rapid development of             \ninternet technology, it has become possible to design different  \nmonitoring and control systems. One of these technologies  is \nthe Internet of Things (IoT). This structure is based on the idea \nof collecting, analyzing, making decisions and managing the \ndata of the environment in which the objects are loc ated on a \ncommon platform [22,23 ]. ThingSpeak is an open IOT \nplatform usin g for real -time monitoring of the data and the \ndata accrued from the sensors can be monitored by means of a \nuser-defined IP address and ThingSpeak API  key [24 ]. Any \nother user can see or download the data by using ThingSpeak \nat any location, if the system operator uses the public IP \naddress. The user can also add location information.  \nIn this study, 2 API addresses have been defined in \nThingSpeak interface as shown in F ig. 4. These have been \nused for transformer online monitoring system Fig. 5. The \ntransformer online monitoring system interface shows real -\ntime winding (hot -spot) temperature, oil bottom, top -oil and \nambient temperatures, oil level and current data from the \nsensors. It is observed that the ambient temperature is constant \nin the test environmen t. When the transformer load is \nincreased in a controlled manner, it is seen that the winding \ntemperature increases with the current. Increased winding \ntemperature increases the aging factor. The aging condition \nand the remaining service life estimation ha ve been calculated \nby reference to the hot spot temperature.  At the oil level, there \nwas no change during the test. The data accrued from the \nsensors and then calculated parameter changes have been \nshown in the ThingSpeak Graphical Interface.  Fig. 6 shows  \nthat the same data can also be accessed via the mobile device.  \nIn this way, the system is constantly under the control of the \noperator. \n \n \nFig. 4.

PUSHINGBOX NOTIFICATION SERVICE \nPushingBox is defined as a cloud that runs with the Internet \nof Things (IoT) and can send many real time notifications like \ne-mail, tweet based on API calls  [2 5, 26]. This free platform \nsupports working with the ESP8266 Wi -Fi module. In this \nway, if any data received from the sensors exceed the critical \nvalues, the notification message can be sent to the computer \nand/or android dev ice with this application. The warning \nnotifications have been tested by deliberately exceeding the \nlimit values, within the scope of this study.  For this purpose, \nan API address has been defined in order to receive \nnotification from PushingBox. Then diff erent notification \nscenarios have been created with this API address. Fig. 7 show \nimages of PushingBox interfaces. \nV. THE REMAINING SERVICE LIFE ESTIMATION DISCUSSIONS \nThe loss of life calculation and the remaining service life \nestimation require analytical p rocessing in the monitoring \nsystem. According to IEEE-C57.91-2011 standards, the loss of \nlife calculations has been performed with reference to the hot -\nspot temperature in windings [ 27]. According to the relevant \nstandards, the service life of the transfor mer in the case of \nnominal operation is 20.55 years [28 ,29]. However, it is \nknown that the service life of transformers varies with \nchanging load conditions [30,31]. The main reason is that the \ntemperature values in the windings are variable due to the hea t \nloss according to the loading conditions. Since the loading \ninformation and the temperature parameters can be received \nvia the monitoring system, it can be performed aging \ncalculations at high resolution  as shown in Fig.8. In the \nmeanwhile, the remaining  service life of the transformer can \nalso be estimated using the linear approach. \n \n231\nBALKAN JOURNAL OF ELE CTRICAL & COMPUTER ENGINEERING,     Vol. 7, No. 3, July  2019                                                 \n \nCopyright © BAJECE                                                                ISSN: 2147-284X                                                     http://dergipark.gov.tr/bajece         \n \nFig. 7.

CONCLUSION \nIn this study, an original IoT based monitoring system has \nbeen developed by using open source software, mod ular and \nlow cost components. With this system, data can be acquired \nfrom different sensors and can be monitored in various \nenvironments such as LCD display, computer, mobile phones, \nand tablets continuously. For this purpose, the ThingSpeak \nplatform free web interface supporting the Internet of Things \n(IoT) technology has been integrated into the system. In \naddition, the PushingBox application, which supports IoT \ntechnology, can send warning messages without additional \nhardware and cost. The developed syst em is capable of \nperforming service life monitoring by using aging equations \ngiven in IEEE -C57.91-2011 standards according to change of \nHST point depending on the loading conditions of \ntransformer. Although the developed system has been \ndesigned to monitor a transformer, it is possible to monitor the \nunits in a number of different locations at the same time as \nreplicating similar monitoring platf orms. The developed \nsystem has been tested on a prototype transformer. It was \nobserved that the data collection, calculation operations and \noutput signals according to the limit values, service life \nmanagement, recording operations and warning systems were \nworking without error. As a result, this system provides a low -\ncost alternative to high-cost professional monitoring systems. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Su, Yu, et al. \"Optimal Planning Method of On -load Capacity \nRegulating Distribution Transformers in Urban Distribution Networks \nafter Electric Energy Replacement Considering \nUncertainties.\" Energies 11.6 (2018): 1457. \n[2] Biçen, Yunus, and Faruk Aras. \"Loadability of power transformer under \nregional climate conditions: the case of Turkey.\"  Electrical \nEngineering 96.4 (2014): 347-358.. \n[3] Humayun, Muhammad, et al. \"Demand response for operational life \nextension and efficient capacity utilization of power transformers during \ncontingencies.\" IEEE Transactions on Power Systems  30.4 (2015): \n2160-2169. \n[4] Osztermayer, J., et al. \"Asset management based on improved online \nmonitoring systems applied to a 110/380 kV substation.\"  Power Tech \nConference Proceedings, 2003 IEEE Bologna.
