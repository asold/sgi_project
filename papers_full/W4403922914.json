    "abstract": "Semantic ontologies offer a formalized, machine-readable framework for representing knowledge, enabling the structured description of complex systems. In the building domain, the adoption of ontologies like the Brick schema has transformed how buildings and their systems are modeled by providing a standardized, interoperable language. However, the complexity and the steep learning curve involved in developing and querying semantic models present substantial challenges, often requiring a workforce with specialized expertise. This paper builds on our experience in investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help address these challenges, focusing on their role in constructing and querying of semantic models, particularly using the Brick Schema. Our study outlines the requirements and metrics for evaluating the scalability and effectiveness of LLM-based tools, while also discussing the current challenges and limitations in developing such tools. Ultimately, this paper aims to orient research efforts as various groups experiment with diverse techniques, while enabling more effective comparison of emerging solutions and fostering collaboration across the field.",
