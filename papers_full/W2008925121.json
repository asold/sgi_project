PLoS Biol 3(11): e380.\nIntroduction\nTool use is deﬁned as‘‘the employment of an unattached\nenvironmental object to alter more efﬁciently the form,\nposition, or condition of another object, another organism,\nor the user itself when the user holds or carries the tool\nduring or just prior to use and is responsible for the proper\nand effective orientation of the tool’’ (p. 10 of [1]). Beck’s\nclassic book [1] deﬁnes six different types of tools: objects\nthrown at predators or rivals, objects used to hit predators,\nhunting weapons (only hominids), objects incorporated into\nsocial displays, objects to clean body parts, and objects made\nand used to acquire food, such as insects or nuts [1,2].\nInformation on tool use and factors favoring tool use in\nwild apes helps us to understand its importance in the\nevolution of our own species. Although there are reports of\ntool use by captive gorillas ( Gorilla sp.), including object\nthrowing and use of tools in feeding [3–9], there has been to\nour knowledge no reported case of tool use in by wild gorillas,\ndespite decades of ﬁeld research. It has been argued that\ngorilla tool use in captivity is less extensive than that shown\nby other apes [10], but it has recently been demonstrated that\ncaptive western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) showed tool-using\nskills similar to those of orangutans(Pongo pygmaeus) [11], who\nfrequently use tools in the wild [12].\nOne possible explanation for the absence of observed tool\nuse in wild gorillas is that they are less dependent on\nextractive foraging techniques that might require the use of\ntools, since they exploit food resources differently than\nchimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) [2,13]. Whereas chimpanzee\nfeeding ecology involves tools such as hammers to crack\nopen nuts and sticks to ﬁsh for termites, gorillas access these\nfood resources by breaking nuts with their teeth and\nsmashing termite mounds with their hands. Nevertheless,\nmountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei) possess food-processing\nskills of comparable complexity and logical organization to\nchimpanzee termite ﬁshing [14], which give them access to\nadditional herbs in their habitat [15].\nHere we report two instances of novel tool use by gorillas,\nboth involving using detached branches to give postural\nsupport to cross water and swamp at Mbeli Bai, a forest\nclearing in northern Congo.\nResults\nOn 9 October 2004, we observed George’s group (moni-\ntored since 1995) near the edge of the clearing 180 m from\nthe observation platform. This group had not been observed\nto use this area for more than 6 mo, and meanwhile elephants\nhad created a new pool to feed on soil. Adult female Leah was\nseen at the pool edge near where a branch was sticking out of\nthe surface, looking intently at the water in front of her for 1\nmin before she entering the water (Figure 1, top left). She\nbegan to cross the pool walking bipedally, but after her ﬁrst\nsteps the water quickly became waist deep and she returned\nto the pool edge. Leah then re-entered again bipedally and\ngrabbed the straight branch in front of her with her right\nhand (Figure 1, top center). Relative to Leah’s body size we\nestimated the leaﬂess branch as being approximately 1 m long\nand 2 cm thick. Leah then detached the stick and, stretching\nforward with it in her right hand, seemed to use it to test the\nwater depth or substrate stability: she grasped the stick ﬁrmly\nand repeatedly prodded the water in front of her with the end\nof the stick (Figure 1, top right). She then moved further into\nthe pool, holding the detached branch in her right hand and\nusing it as a walking stick for postural support (Figure 1,\nbottom three images). She advanced a further 8–10 m from\nthe pool edge (not shown), repeating the actions shown in\nFigure 1, and then, leaving the stick in the pond, returned\nto her entry point, where her offspring was crying. She did\nnot re-enter the water, but instead moved around the pool to\nfeed on aquatic herbs.\nThe second observation involved female Eﬁ from Zulu\ngroup (monitored since 2000), who entered the clearing on 21\nNovember 2004, 150 m from the observation platform. While\nclose to the forest edge Eﬁ detached a 1.3-m-long and 5-cm-\nReceived February 2, 2005; Accepted September 9, 2005; Published October 1,\n2005\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030380\nCopyright: /C2112005 Breuer et al.

She\nforcefully pushed it into the ground with both hands (Figure\n2, middle) and held the tool for support with her left hand\nover her head for 2 min while dredging food with the other\nhand (Figure 2, bottom). Eﬁ then took the trunk with both\nhands and placed it on the swampy ground in front of her,\ncrossed bipedally on this self-made bridge, and walked\nquadrupedally towards the middle of the clearing (not\nshown). We could not see if the bridge was long enough to\ncross the swampy ground, but it certainly gave the female\nmore stability underfoot and supported her weight for at\nleast part of the distance.\nDiscussion\nIt has been proposed that animals that can obtain resources\nby force may not need to rely on tools [2,13], but our\nobservations show that other functional demands may also\nstimulate tool use, at least in apes. Our observations of gorilla\ntool use for postural support in a swampy habitat supports\narguments that the use of tools reﬂects ecological needs and\nmay therefore be viewed as an adaptation to a particular suite\nof environmental conditions [14]. Swamp habitat demands\nparticular behavioral adaptations for western gorillas and\nmay stimulate special behaviors, such as the splash display of\nadult male silverbacks at Mbeli Bai [16]. The forest edges of\nMbeli Bai are heavily inundated, and gorillas often use\nbranches to haul themselves out of the water or move around\nthe edge of the clearing, but the cases reported here are the\nﬁrst observations, to our knowledge, of wild gorillas using\ndetached objects as tools.\nThe observed tool use involved gorillas from two different\ngroups and thus could indicate independent inventions,\nperhaps reﬂecting past negative experiences with deep water.\nHowever, there is also the intriguing possibility that using\nbranches to test water depth or as bridges is a more common\nadaptation to this particular habitat. Footprints of gorillas\nwalking over branches as bridges have been observed in other\nswampy clearings not far from Mbeli Bai [17].\nWe make no hypothesis about the mode of acquisition of\nthis tool use behavior, but simply note that the high\npopulation density of western gorillas in northern Congo\n[18–20] makes social learning a possible transmission route\n[2].\nAll great apes use tools in captivity, but until recently tool\nuse in the wild was only regularly observed in chimpanzees\nand orangutans [12,21,22]. There are now reports of tool use\nby bonobos (P. paniscus) [23] and western gorillas, which\nhighlights the importance of long-term studies in these\nspecies.\nMaterials and Methods\nMbeli Bai is a 12.9-ha large swampy forest clearing in the in the\nsouthwest part of Nouabale´-Ndoki National Park, Republic of Congo.\nThe clearing includes streams and elephant pools and is dominated\nby aquatic vegetation in the Cyperaceae, Gramineae, and Hydro-\ncharitaceae families. The aquatic vegetation forms a ﬂoating surface\nto the bai, with an average depth of 1 m [24]. Monitoring of the social\norganization, demography, and behavior of western gorillas at Mbeli\nBai has been ongoing since 1995 [25,26]. Observations are made with\n15–45 3 60 mm telescopes from a 9-m-high viewing platform\noverlooking the clearing. Gorillas are habituated to the presence of\nresearchers and can be identiﬁed by their distinctive features, such as\npelage, nose prints, and shape of brow ridges [25].\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the Ministe` re de l’Economie Forestie` re and the Nouabale´-\nNdoki Project of the Wildlife Conservation Society for permission to\nwork in Nouabale´-Ndoki National Park.
