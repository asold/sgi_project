    "abstract": "Abstract Background older people living with frailty benefit from targeted interventions which improve health and independence. However, it has been challenging within primary care to systematically identify patients living with frailty. Study aims Methods primary care IT was re-programmed to create a ‘Pathfields High Risk Cohort’ (PHRC, patients felt likely to have undiagnosed frailty) and invite clinicians to opportunistically assess and diagnose frailty. Results were compared with NHS England’s current approach to frailty identification using Electronic Frailty Index (eFI) to see which approach had the highest diagnostic yield. Results the Pathfields Tool identified 1,348 patients in PHRC group, of whom 951 (70.5%) were clinically assessed and diagnosed: eFI (moderate and severe) identified 683 patients of whom 598 (87.6%) were clinically assessed and diagnosed: Extrapolated data would estimate frailty prevalence at 22.5% (1,024/4,552) (5.5% severe, 8.8% moderate, and 8.1% mild) in the practice population aged 65+. Conclusions the Pathfields Tool identified more patients with clinically confirmed previously undiagnosed frailty than eFI ‘moderate and severe frailty’ alone. Sub-segmenting frailty by residential status could significantly improve the population health management of older people.",
