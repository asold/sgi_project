INTRODUCTION  \nDuring the last decades, transformer oils, consisting of a \nmixture of hydrocarbons including paraffins, isoparaffins, \nnaphthenes and aromatics, have enjoyed extensive use [1]. \nSuch a liquid undergoes aging depending on its exposure to \nprolonged heating and electrical stresses. Aging of transformer \noil results to gradual change in its electrical and thermal \nproperties, i.e. a change in color and a formation of solid \nbyproducts. Transformer oil, although an excellent insulating \nmedium, has also its weak aspects, such as its sensitivity to \nhumidity (it has been reported, for example, that oil at 20 oC \nwith water contents of 44ppm will have only 25% of its normal \ndielectric strength [2]). Various studies have been carried out \nregarding the properties and aging of transformer oil, such as \nthe dielectric strength, the humidity content, the role of air \nbubbles on its electrical behavior, the variation of dielectric \nconstant and density w.r.t temperature etc. [3-7]. In [8], a \ncomprehensive review was given regarding the properties and \napplications of a variety of insulating liquids. In that review, \nexcept the transformer oil, there were comments on silicone oil, \nfluorinated liquids, chlorinated and phosphate fluids, and ester \nand synthetic hydrocarbons. Polybutene liquids were also \nmentioned as possible substitutes to transformer oil, especially \nregarding the dielectric strength [1, 9] (in fact the DC dielectric \nstrength of some polybutene oils was found to increase with \nincreasing liquid density up to 65MV/m at a density of \n880kg/m 3 as compared to untreated transformer oil under the \nsame conditions). The mechanisms of breakdown in \ntransformer oil have been thoroughly studied [10-12]. \nMoreover, efforts have been made to improve the general \nelectrical performance of transformer oil by adding minute \nquantities of certain substances, as has been reported in [13-\n16]. Furthermore, the state of transformer oil has been \ninvestigated with classical diagnostic techniques [17], as well \nas with more modern diagnostic techniques [18].  \nAlthough transformer oil has served satisfactorily the high \nvoltage industry for many years, it became evident that there \nwere some less positive aspects about it, such as its \ninflammability and the fact that it is not biodegradable. The \naim of the present paper is to give a concise review of some \nalternatives to transformer oil and comment on their various \naspects. It is evident that in the context of the present review \nthere will be no mention of nanofluids [19, 20]. It must be \nemphasized that the present short review does not by any \nmeans include all possible alternative fluids to transformer oil \nsince only vegetable oils are particularly mentioned and \ndiscussed. \nII.  E\nARLIER PROPOSALS FOR ALTERNATIVES TO \nTRANSFORMER OIL  \nEarlier attempts to replace transformer oil with other liquids \nare reported in [8]. Ester hydrocarbons can be chemically \ntailored so as to produce high thermal stability or fire resistance \nif used in transformers [8]. Polybutene oils were reported as \nhaving certain advantages regarding their dielectric strength in \ncomparison to transformer oil [1, 9, 21]. Moreover, polybutene \noils present, among others, high fire resistance and heat \ndissipation as well as arc discharge quenching [22]. Silicone \nfluids further enhance the thermal stability properties [21]. \nThey are fire resistant but - at least at the initial stages of their \ndevelopment – they suffered from poor heat transfer [23]. As \nnoted in a later publication [24], silicone fluids w.r.t. their \ncooling and insulating properties, compare reasonably well \nwith mineral oils. Silicone oils are environment friendly with a \nstrong resistance to oxidation and sludge formation, but they \nare rather expensive and they have high viscosities at 200ºC \n[25]. Fluorinated oils may be excellent insulating liquids but \nwere expensive with a questionable effect on the environment \n[8]. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-based insulating liquids, \nalthough they have high fire security standards, they proved to \nbe a liability because of their toxicity and their \nbioaccumulation [8, 21, 24, 26-28]. Phosphate esters were \nEngineering, Technology & Applied Science Research  Vol. 10 , No. 6, 20 20 , 6570 -6577  6571  \n \nwww.etasr.com  Danikas & Sarathi: Alternative Fluids – with a Particular Emphasis on Vegetable Oils – as …  \n \nanother alternative because they were relatively cheap. They \nwere, however, more destined as lubricants and rather poor \ninsulants [29]. Questions also have been raised regarding their \nenvironmental hazards [8]. \nOther approaches for alternative liquids, such as \nelectronegative fluids or liquefied elemental gases will not be \nmentioned here, since the former played more the role of \nrefrigerants, and the latter were destined for use in \nsuperconducting magnets in high energy particle machines [8]. \nMoreover, the subject of liquefied gases was partially dealt \nwith in a recent review publication [30]. \nIII.  FACTORS THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE BEHAVIOR OF \nINSULATING LIQUIDS  \nAs was noted in [8], transformers require a fluid which has \nboth good insulating properties and which can also be an \nefficient coolant. Low loss tangent and high resistivity are also \nrequired. The fluid must be non-flammable, non-toxic and \nbiodegradable. Low gas absorption and low expansion \ncoefficient must also characterize a transformer fluid. The fluid \nmust be – as far as it is possible - free of impurities (dust, \nfibers, and metallic particles) and its gas content should be as \nsmall as possible. Gas bubbles may enhance electron emission \nand cause premature failure and thus should be avoided [31]. \nSince in a liquid filled system such as a transformer, heat is \ntransferred mainly by convection, the thermal conductivity of \nthe fluid is of primary importance [8]. The temperature effect is \na complex phenomenon because of the possible changes in \ncathode emission, gas content and fluid viscosity [31]. Let us \nnot also forget the interplay between moisture and temperature, \nsince it has been reported that oil having small amounts of \nmoisture showed an increase in dielectric strength, whereas the \nopposite effect was observed with dry oil [31]. Viscosity is \nanother significant parameter in determining the heat flow in a \ntransformer. As temperature increases, the fluid viscosity \nrapidly falls and consequently the cooling effect is greatly \nenhanced [8]. Needless to say that big differences may exist \nbetween new and aging oil, as has been reported previously, \nespecially regarding the dissipation factor and the dielectric \nstrength, and this is the reason of periodic control of the oil \nquality and – if need be – its replacement [32-34]. Yet another \nvital parameter is the resistance of the fluid to discharges. This, \nhowever, depends on the nature of the fluid. Other insulating \nliquids release gas bubbles, whereas others absorb gas bubbles, \nas was noted in [8, 35]. Besides the factors, it would be fitting \nto add that for some of the liquids mentioned above, there are \nserious objections. Fluorinated oils, for example, have a high \ncost, so that their use is rather prohibitive [36, 37]. Polybutene \noils, although non-toxic and environmentally friendly with \nrather satisfactory flash points, are rather expensive for use in \nlarge volumes [24]. \nIV.  POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO TRANSFORMER OI : \nMODERN APPROACHES  \nSilicone oil, synthetic ester and natural ester oils are \npossible alternatives to transformer oil. Silicone oils, however, \nbesides some problematic aspects as mentioned above, are still \nhighly viscous at higher temperatures and present limited \nbiodegradability [38]. As noted in [24], in order to avoid large \ntemperature rises during operation, silicone-filled transformers \nmust be de-rated (up to 10%) or provided with additional \ncooling capacity. On the other hand, synthetic esters are usually \nderived from the combination of more than one alcohol \nfunctional group (polyol) with carboxylic acids leading to a \ncentral polyol structure. Most preferably the synthetic ester is \ndefined as a family of polyol esters and in particular these \nfluids are pentaerythritol tetra ester as shown in Figure 1. \n \n \nFig. 1.  Structure of synthetic ester. \nwhere R represents an alkyl group ranging from C 5 H 11  to \nC 9H 19 . Synthetic esters present high oxidation stability, have a \nvery good cold temperature performance and are easily \nbiodegradable [38]. Synthetic ester liquids can absorb \nsignificantly more moisture than transformer oil before their \ninsulating properties deteriorate [24]. Tetraesters (or \npentaerythritol esters) are environmentally friendly but they are \nexpensive. Tetraesters can absorb moisture produced by \nthermal degradation of cellulose (paper) present in the \nwindings, their viscosity, however, is higher than that of \ntransformer oil [24, 39]. In [39], it is noted that the high \nsaturation limit of such liquids (many times higher than that of \nmineral oil) reduces the moisture content in the solid insulation \ndue to water diffusion into the liquid, having better insulating \nperformance as a consequence. It should also be pointed out \nthat the higher moisture content implies the formation of free \nfatty acids [24]. The higher absorption of moisture of tetraester \nfluids is due to their carbonyl structure, as reported in [40]. \nPhosphoric esters have high fire point and permittivity. In \ncertain aspects, such as breakdown voltage, dissipation factor \nand resistivity, they are supposed to be comparable or even \nbetter than mineral oil, but they tend to also have some \nnegative aspects because they pose some environmental risks \n[24, 41]. Because of the latter, their use is rather limited. \nNatural ester consists of a glycerol backbone with different \nfatty acid groups and it can be saturated, mono unsaturated, and \npoly unsaturated. Vegetable oils can easily be obtained from \nnatural products and are considered reasonable replacements of \ntransformer oil. As was noted in [24], they consist essentially \nof triglycerides (Figure 2), which are naturally synthesized by \nthe esterification of the tri-alcohol glycerol with three fatty \nacids. One of the aforementioned oils is castor oil, which is a \nvegetable oil from the castor bean. It is colorless to very yellow \npale with mild or no odor or taste. Its boiling point is 313°C \n(595°F) and its density is 961kg/m3. It is a triglyceride in \nwhich approximately between 87% and 90% of fatty acid \nchains are ricinoleic acid [42]. It was found in the same \n\nEngineering, Technology & Applied Science Research  Vol. 10 , No. 6, 20 20 , 6570 -6577  6572  \n \nwww.etasr.com  Danikas & Sarathi: Alternative Fluids – with a Particular Emphasis on Vegetable Oils – as …  \n \npublication, however, that the dielectric strength of castor oil is \nnot as good as that of transformer oil. The results of [42], were \nsomehow contradicted in [43], where it was shown that castor \nseed oil gave breakdown values that were comparable (but not \nsuperior) to those of transformer oil. On the contrary, castor \nseed oil’s flash point, pour point, and viscosity were found to \nbe better than those of the transformer oil. In yet another \npublication, castor oil was blended with madhucaindica oil and \nthe mixture showed to have satisfactory heat transfer, pour \npoint, flash point, and viscosity compared to transformer oil but \nits dielectric strength was found to be lower than that of \ntransformer oil. The authors concluded that such a blend can \nwork for low but not for high voltage transformers [44]. They \nremarked, however, that with more refinement this blend can \nalso be used for high voltage transformers. \n \n \nFig. 2.  Structure of natural ester. \nIn Figure 2, the structure of natural ester is depicted, where \nR, R’, and R’’ refer to the different alkyl groups with a major \nvariation in the number of C=C double bonds. The chemical \ncomposition of different fatty acid groups (Table I) determines \nthe physical properties of the oil, i.e. with higher amount of \nsaturated acids in the ester group, the fluid is more stable \ntowards oxidation and less viscous compared to unsaturated \nacids which makes them unstable [45]. \nTABLE I.  FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF VEGETABLE OILS  \nOil fatty \nacid \nSaturated fatty acid Mono-\nunsaturated \nPoly- \nunsaturated \nPalmitic \nacid \n(C16:0) \nStearic \nacid \n(C18:0) \nOleic \nacid \n(C18:1) \nLinoleic \nacid \n(C18:2) \nPalm  45 4 40 10 \nOlive 11 3 71 10 \nRapeseed 4 2 62 22 \nSunflower 7 5 19 68 \nSoyabean 11 4 24 54 \n \nVegetable oils were investigated in [46], where their \nadvantages and disadvantages were treated accordingly. It was \nremarked that vegetable oils are susceptible to oxidation, and \nthus hermetic sealing is required in order to ensure optimum \nperformance. The use of vegetable oils in transformers – \nbecause of their higher viscosity - results in increased \ntemperatures of between 10 and 30°C. The higher viscosity, \nhowever, has also its positive aspect since it implies reduced \nspread in case of spillage conditions. On the other hand, their \npour point is satisfactory, they are classified as low \nflammability liquids, their breakdown voltages tend to be much \nhigher than those of mineral and silicone oils even with \nsubstantial amounts of moisture, and, last but not least, the \noperating temperatures of vegetable oils are clearly higher than \nthose of mineral oils. The latter point of [46] is contested in \n[47], where it was claimed that in the case of power \ntransformers (e.g. 160MVA) temperature increase in \ntransformers filled with esters can be even greater as compared \nto the temperature of the transformer filled with mineral oil. \nTherefore, according to [47], in order to use synthetic or natural \nester, the changing of the geometry of the transformer \n(increasing its size), the reduction of the load, or the \nmodification of the cooling system should be considered. \nAnother perspective on vegetable oils was given in [48], \nwhere soya bean oil and palm kernel oil were investigated. The \nauthors concluded that both aforementioned oils can be used as \nreplacements for mineral oil on the condition of refinement \nsince they possess a lower dielectric strength and they hold \nmore moisture than mineral oil. The viscosity of both oils is \nhigher than that of mineral oil and their flash point is much \nhigher than that of mineral oil. The authors seemed to \nreluctantly propose both vegetable oils as replacements of the \ntransformer oil on the condition of further purification. Authors \nin [48] seem to agree with the results published before, where \nmineral oil was compared with vegetable oil and synthetic ester \noil in the presence of pressboard [49]. In [49], Partial Discharge \n(PD) levels were found to be higher in both alternative oils than \nin mineral oil. Although no specific reason was given for such \ndifferences in the PD level, [49] was an effort to investigate \nsolid/liquid insulation as is used in transformer windings. \nAlthough there was some skepticism, as reported above, there \nwere other publications that suggested the use of vegetable oils, \nsince these presented a dielectric strength comparable to that of \nmineral oil and the saturated fatty acid content in such oils \nretarded the deterioration of the insulating fluid in high-\ntemperature environments or long-term storage conditions. \nMoreover, vegetable oils showed more cooling ability and high \ninsulation capacity than mineral oil [50]. Authors in [51] agree \nwith [50], reporting that while oxidation of mineral oil \nproduces sludge precipitates, vegetable oils are much more \nresistant to oxidation. \nVegetable oils have been researched in [52], where the \nauthors carried out a detailed study of Rice Bran Oil (RBO), \nCorn Oil (CO) and transformer oil. Their investigations \nindicated that when the viscosity of transformer oil is lower \nthan those of RBO and CO, the flash point and the fire point of \nthe vegetable oils were much higher than those of the \ntransformer oil, with the dielectric strength of RBO being \nhigher than that of transformer oil. All in all, the authors of [52] \nconcluded that, because of the rich content of fatty acids, \nvegetable oils – and particularly RBO – give enhanced \nperformances compared to the transformer oil. RBO was also \ninvestigated in [53] along with with sesame oil, sunflower oil, \nand mineral oil in a comparative study. RBO was superior to \nthe other examined oils regarding the flash point (but not the \nfire point, where sesame oil was found to be superior), the \nbreakdown voltage and the viscosity. The oxidation stability of \nthe aforementioned vegetable oils, however, was not as good as \nthat of the mineral oil. The latter statement on oxidation \nstability is in agreement with [54, 55], where it was reported \nthat olive oil offered excellent resistance to aging, rapeseed oil \n\nEngineering, Technology & Applied Science Research  Vol. 10 , No. 6, 20 20 , 6570 -6577  6573  \n \nwww.etasr.com  Danikas & Sarathi: Alternative Fluids – with a Particular Emphasis on Vegetable Oils – as …  \n \noffered intermediate properties whereas corn and sunflower oil \noxidized appreciably after aging. Authors in [55] reported that \npartial discharge magnitudes of Palm Fatty Acid Ester (PFAE) \nare slightly lower than those of petroleum-based mineral oil \nduring the aging time, which somehow contradicts the findings \nin [49]. In [56], the authors investigated the problem of \ndielectric strength of mineral oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, and \nrapeseed oil from another viewpoint, namely that of statistical \nanalysis. They found that for the above mentioned oils and with \nplane-plane electrodes, the vegetable oils had a higher mean \ndielectric strength than mineral oil. A later work [57], pointed \nout that the AC dielectric strength of the synthetic ester oil and \nthe natural ester oil were higher than the dielectric strength of \nmineral oil as moisture was increasing. In the same work, the \nimpulse dielectric strength of the vegetable liquids seemed to \nbe less affected than that of mineral oil. It should be noted, \nhowever, regarding PD activity, both palm oil and corn oil \nshowed a lower activity than mineral oil with a rod-plane \nelectrode arrangement at 25 kV, especially after thermal aging \nof 30 and 45 days [57]. The PD results of [57] are in \ndisagreement with the results of [49]. \nCoconut oil was the exclusive subject of [58], where it was \nclaimed that its dielectric strength with both mushroom and \nspherical electrodes was satisfactory. The authors studied the \nvariation of its dielectric strength w.r.t. moisture content but \nthey did not compare coconut oil with mineral oil. Their claim, \nhowever, that coconut oil can be an alternative to transformer \noil was supported from an earlier publication [59], where \ncoconut oil was shown to have higher dielectric strength than \ntransformer oil, having also a much higher flash point. The \nexperimental results of [58] are in accordance with those of \n[60], where coconut oil was found to be even superior to \nrefined, bleached, deodorized palm oil (RBDPO). Further \ndetailed studies with soybean oil, coconut oil, palm oil and rice \nhusk oil revealed that all of them have higher flash and fire \npoints than mineral oil, with coconut oil, palm oil and rice husk \noil having also higher breakdown values than mineral oil [61]. \nSoybean oil was found to be no better than mineral oil \nregarding breakdown voltage. In that, reference [61] was at \nvariance with the data presented in [48]. The experimental \nresults of [61] deviate significantly from those of [62], where a \nsurprisingly very low dielectric strength for coconut oil was \nobserved in comparison with mineral oil. No specific \nexplanation was given by the authors of [62] for such low \ndielectric strength values of the coconut oil. Coconut oil has \nindeed lower dielectric strength than virgin coconut oil and \npalm oil [63], but not as low as that reported in [62]. On the \nother hand, there have been earlier reports mentioning the \nrather low dielectric strength values of coconut oil in \ncomparison to transformer oil [64], but not as low as those of \n[62]. Yet again, such data are contradicted from recent \nexperimental results suggesting that the dielectric strength of \ncoconut oil is very similar to that of mineral oil [65]. \nRecent studies showed that vegetable oils are possible \nreplacements for mineral oil [66]. The authors in [66] \ninvestigated a variety of vegetable oils, such as corn oil, castor \noil, olive oil, and ester oil. Especially the dielectric strength of \ncorn, castor, and olive oils was higher than the dielectric \nstrength of mineral oil. The authors concluded that such \nvegetable oils can replace mineral oil in power transformers. In \n[67], both the positive and negative aspects of vegetable oils \nhave been discussed. The author remarked that, besides the \npositive aspects – which have been referred to also above -, \nthere are also some negative aspects of vegetable oils, namely \nthat their cooling function is not as good as that of the mineral \noil and the dielectric strength under lightning voltages is \ninferior to that of the mineral oil. Furthermore, and in relation \nto kraft paper, the positive and negative aspects have been \ndiscussed in [68]. Others reported that higher rates of water \nmigration from paper to the oil was observed during heating of \nnatural ester oil in comparison with mineral oil [69]. In a \nfurther publication it was reported that the kraft paper/mineral \noil combination lowered the Degree of Polymerization (DP) \nindex, defined as the average number of repeating units that are \ncontained in the molecular chain of a polymer, even more than \nthe kraft paper/vegetable oil combination [70]. The authors of \n[70] used two vegetable ester-based oils without, however, \ngiving full details about them. Agreeing with [70], another \nwork reported that testing with Jatropha curcas oil, the latter’s \ncombination with kraft paper gave a rather satisfactory DP. \nMoreover, the refining process of Jatropha curcas oil, although \nit did not influence the physical properties of density, viscosity, \nand fire point, it improved somehow its flash and pour points \ngiving also a very satisfactory dielectric strength [71]. It has to \nbe noted, however, that without antioxidants, Jatropha curcas \noil tends to be considerably oxidized during accelerated aging \n[72]. \nThe better cooling function of mineral oil in comparison to \nvegetable oils has also been reported in [73]. In the latter \npublication, however, emphasis was given on other aspects of \nvegetable oils, such as their rather satisfactory AC dielectric \nstrength, high biodegradability, and fire safety. Of the \nvegetable oils tested, RBDPO was found to have a high \nbreakdown voltage and low dissipation factor among the other \ncandidates (soybean oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, coconut \noil), and thus it was suggested as the best alternative fluid to \nmineral oil. Other researchers,  however, reported that extra \nvirgin olive oil and castor oil have very high dielectric \nstrengths [74]. Extensive work on soybean-based oil revealed \nthat it releases more ethane than mineral oil,  whereas the \nDielectric Dissipation Factor (DDF) is normally higher for a \nvegetable oil than for a mineral oil [75]. Experimental work on \nrapeseed oil revealed that its dielectric strength is comparable \nto that of mineral oil [76], and that it can be used for power \ntransformers, especially if improved through the use of an \nantioxidant [77].  \nV.  C HALLENGES INVOLVED WITH ALTERNATE FLUIDS FOR \nTRANSPORT APPLICATIONS  \nThe higher thermal class of ester fluids makes them viable \nin densely populated areas or commercial buildings such as \nshopping malls and airports. Further, the transformers filled \nwith such liquids can be placed closer to the buildings which \nbenefit from its reduced equipment spacing requirements as \nspecified in the National Electrical Code (NFPA 70). When \ncomparing the installation of transformers containing ester \nfluids with existing mineral oil, it also provides additional \nbenefit of shorter Low Voltage (LV) cable runs and hence \nEngineering, Technology & Applied Science Research  Vol. 10 , No. 6, 20 20 , 6570 -6577  6574  \n \nwww.etasr.com  Danikas & Sarathi: Alternative Fluids – with a Particular Emphasis on Vegetable Oils – as …  \n \nlower losses. The ester fluids are hygroscopic in nature, so \nprecautionary measures on storage and handling such liquids \nmust be taken care of in order to prevent their reaction with \natmospheric moisture and hence these liquids are \nrecommended in non-breathing transformers. The relative \npermittivity of any dielectrics affects the electric field \ndistribution in the winding structures and must be considered \nbefore the use of new alternate liquids inside the transformers, \nwhere the stress exerted at the oil/pressboard interface is very \nlow on the usage of ester fluids due to its minimal variation in \npermittivity. Also, the fluid flow characteristics along with \nthermal modeling of windings must be considered before \ndesigning in order to evaluate the difference in temperature rise \nfor an ester filled transformer, compared to standard mineral \noil. \nVI.  S\nOME THOUGHTS ON FUTURE RESEARCH  \nInterest in vegetable oils was noted a long time ago [78, \n79]. Excellent reviews have been published on alternative \nfluids to transformer oil [80]. Without doubt, vegetable oils can \nbe a hope for the future replacement of mineral oil in power \ntransformers. There are, however, efforts to be undertaken in \norder to clarify certain pending issues. Some conflicting data \nreported above must be further looked upon and further \nexperiments should be carried out. There is still some \nuncertainty regarding the dielectric strength of some vegetable \noils as well as their PD behavior [81, 82]. Further research \nshould be directed towards this goal. The weakness of \nvegetable oils w.r.t. lightning impulses should also be further \nresearched. Moreover, studies on the long-term performance of \npaper insulation with vegetable oils must be carried out. \nConsiderable efforts regarding the study of paper/vegetable oil \ninsulation have already been undertaken [83, 84]. Detailed \nreports on pre-breakdown and breakdown phenomena \nregarding the vegetable oils must also be produced, as was the \ncase in more conventional fluids [12, 85-88]. In conjunction to \npre-breakdown and breakdown phenomena and related \nmechanisms, vegetable oil-based nanofluids must be \ninvestigated regarding their dielectric strength, volume \nresistivity, and dissipation factor [89]. Furthermore, techniques \nthat proved to be useful in studying PD in transformer oil, \nshould be tried and further developed also with vegetable \nliquids [90-92]. Last but not least, experimental work on blends \nof mineral and synthetic and natural ester oils should continue, \nespecially in the view of the recent research, which pointed out \nthat the oxidation rate of such a blend was lower than the one \nof mineral oil [93, 94].  \nVII.  C\nONCLUSIONS  \nThis – by no means exhaustive – review points the fact that \nthere may be alternatives to mineral oil. Possible candidates for \nthe replacement of mineral oil already exist. A lot of \nexperimental data point out that vegetable oils show specific \nadvantages in comparison to mineral oil, such as \nbiodegradability, flash and fire points, higher permittivity \n(which is advantageous when the oil is combined with paper \ninsulation), and, on certain occasions, satisfactory dielectric \nstrength. Some negative aspects of the said oils are also \nmentioned in this short review as well as some still conflicting \nevidence regarding certain experimental results. Although \nvegetable oils seem to be promising candidates as replacements \nof transformer oil, further experimental work must be done. \nThoughts for further research are also given. \nR EFERENCES  \n[1]  T.
