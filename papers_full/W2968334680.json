Introduction\nA transformer is an important part of the power transmission and transformation equipment,\nand the normal operation of the transformer ensures the safety of the power system. Once the\ntransformer is damaged, it will not only cause long-term interruption of the power supply, but also\ngreatly aﬀect the industrial and agricultural production. In addition, the transformer is an expensive\ndevice with a complicated structure. Once the damage is caused, the repair is extremely diﬃcult\nand inevitably causes serious economic losses. Therefore, accurately identifying the potential\nfailure of the transformer can eﬀectively maintain and repair the transformer. In order to ensure\nthe smooth operation of the transformer, eﬀective detection is required to prevent various faults.\nAmong them, monitoring methods for transformers include: insulation monitoring, temperature\nmonitoring, on load tap changer (OLTC) monitoring of core and insulation leakage current\nmonitoring, monitoring of winding and monitoring of working conditions.\n162 Y. Li, L. Ma Arch. Elect. Eng.\nIn the case of partial discharge and overheating, oil and insulation paper in the transformer\nwill be decomposed, and produce CO, CO 2 and various hydrocarbon gases. Therefore, there is a\nclose relationship between the composition and concentration of the gas in the oil and the type of\ntransformer fault. Almost all the large transformers use transformer oil for insulation and heating.\nDuring the operation of the transformer, the solid insulation material in the transformer oil will\nbe aging and decomposition under the mixed eﬀect of the combination of various factors such\nas discharge, high temperature and oxidation will occur. Some gases will be produced, such as\nlow molecular hydrocarbons like CH 4, C 2H6, C 2H4 and C 2H2, as well as gases of CO, CO 2 and\nH2. When partial discharge or overheating occurs in the transformer, the gas will be produced\nin large quantities, so the analysis of the gas content in the oil to diagnose the transformer fault\nis a trend in recent years [1]. In addition, the dissolved gases analysis (DGA) in oil will not be\naﬀected by external electric ﬁelds and magnetic ﬁelds, and it can detect the latent faults existing\ninside the transformer and can become an eﬀective method for the fault diagnosis of oil-immersed\ntransformers [2].\nBy analyzing the gas composition and concentration in the oil of the transformer, the type\nof transformer fault can be judged. In recent years, researchers have proposed a variety of\ntransformer fault diagnosis methods, such as a characteristic gas method and three-ratio method.\nThe advantage of these methods is that the principle is simple and easy to implement, but because\nthe ratio boundary is too absolute, it is diﬃcult to provide an explanation for all possible ratio\ncombinations. Besides, transformers of diﬀerent voltage levels are diﬃcult to make reasonable\nadjustments when applying the ratio, so most of these traditional diagnosis methods only make\na vague judgment on the type of fault, and may even cause misjudgment of the fault type.\nDue to the diagnosis results of the traditional diagnosis methods are not ideal, the transformer\ndiagnosis methods based on artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms such as neural networks [3–11],\ngenetic algorithms [12], fuzzy theory [13] and expert systems [14] have developed rapidly.\nYan Luo et al. proposed an algorithm based on the quantum immune optimization of a back-\npropagation (BP) neural network for transformer fault diagnosis. Compared with the traditional\nback-propagation neural network (BPNN), it can improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis and\nreach the eﬀective identiﬁcation of transformer faults [7]. Wenxiong Mo et al . combined a\nparticle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with support vector machine to optimize the key\nparameters to enhance the fault diagnosis capability [8]. Jie Dai et al . proposed a transformer\nfault diagnosis method based on deep belief networks (DBN) to improve diagnosis accuracy,\ntheir DBN model adopts multi-layer and multi-dimension mapping to extract more detailed\ndiﬀerences of fault types [9]. Xingquan Ji et al . established a fault diagnosis model based on\nstacked auto-encoders and softmax regression, and the method can solve the problems such as\navailability of data extraction, a better local optimum and a gradient to dissipate more eﬃciently\n[10]. The performance of an artiﬁcial intelligence method mainly depends on its parameters, but\nthe current selection of various artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms is diﬃcult. Therefore, how to use\nan intelligent optimization algorithm to ﬁnd suitable model parameters has become the research\nfocus of an artiﬁcial intelligence method for transformer fault diagnosis. In order to improve the\nshortcomings of the artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms, some transformer fault diagnosis algorithms\nbased on improved artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms have been proposed [15–17].\nIn this paper, the online sequence extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) algorithm is studied.\nAnd we found that the OS-ELM algorithm randomly selects the input weight and the hidden\nlayer deviation, which causes some hidden layer nodes to be invalid. Therefore, the sample\nVol. 68 (2019) Fault diagnosis of power transformer based on improved 163\ngeneralization is insuﬃcient and the network output is not stable enough. In response to this\nproblem, the paper proposes an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm to\noptimize the OS-ELM. The main contributions of the paper are as follows: ﬁrst, the PSO algorithm\nis improved and applied to optimize the parameter selection of the OS-ELM algorithm, the\nalgorithm is named IPSO-OS-ELM, which overcomes the instability of the OS-ELM algorithm.\nSecondly, the transformer fault diagnosis model is established based on the IPSO-OS-ELM\nalgorithm, which improves the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis. Finally, the experimental\nresults show that the proposed model has a good eﬀect on transformer fault diagnosis.\n2. Improved particle swarm optimization\n2.1. Particle swarm optimization\nParticle swarm optimization (PSO) is an evolutionary computation that ﬁnds the optimal\nsolution in a given search space based on the probability law. Its characteristics are as follows:\n1. The PSO can get more accurate results without complicated operations.\n2. Because the PSO is a probabilistic application, it is more ﬂexible and eﬀective.\n3. It can overcome premature convergence and improve search ability.\n4. PSO optimization takes less time.\n5. In online mode, the PSO will get a better solution.\nThe PSO algorithm is a matrix-based stochastic optimization technique proposed by Kennedy\nand Eberhart in 1995. The algorithm compares the search process to the process of birds searching\nfor food in a given search space. There is a speciﬁc spatial area, although the birds do not know the\nspeciﬁc location of the food, they know the distance of the food, each time the bird searches for\nfood, it will be closer to the food. In this process, each bird is likened to a particle. Each particle\nhas two properties: speed and position and each particle has a memory function. The particle\ncan remember the best position it searched. Each time the particles search, they will follow the\ncurrent optimal particle until the optimal solution is found [18].\nIn the particle swarm optimization process, each particle is a solution, and each iteration is a\nprocess of ﬁnding the optimal solution, which is better to move closer to the search space. The\ncalculation formula is as shown in (1):\nvi (t + 1) = !vi (t) + c1r1\n[yi (t) \u0000 xi (t)] + c2r2\n[gi (t) \u0000 xi (t)] : (1)\nIn the above formula, ! is the inertia weight, yi (t) is the optimal position of the particle\nindividual in the iterative process, gi (t) is the optimal position of the whole in the iterative\nprocess. The optimal position of the single particle is represented by pbest, that is the best position\nof the particle is in the search process at time t, gbest represents the best position of the overall\nposition found by the entire particle swarm after searching the global. The ﬁtness is calculated\nby the objective function. The current position of the calculated particle is represents by xi (t), c1\nand c2 both represent the acceleration of the particle, r1 and r2 indicating the direction of motion,\nand the number is randomly selected from the uniform distribution, and the speed has a limit\nvalue, and the general limited range is (Vmin; Vmax).\nAfter one iteration, the particle will update its position, as shown in (2):\nxi (t + 1) = xi (t) + vi (t + 1): (2)\n164 Y. Li, L. Ma Arch. Elect. Eng.\n2.2. Improved particle swarm optimization\nIn order to improve the optimization ability of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm,\nmany scholars have studied the improvement of particle swarm optimization algorithm. For\nexample, the literature [19] proposed a particle swarm optimization algorithm based on fuzzy\ncontrol, generating an optimized fuzzy function to the improved PSO. In [20], a new chaotic\noptimization particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed. The algorithm integrates chaotic\nthought into the particle swarm search process and builds a chaotic particle swarm model. It\novercomes the defect of the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm, due to which it is\neasy to fall into precocity, and it gets local extremum points in the initial stage of the optimization,\nwhich further improves the global optimization ability. In this paper, a new particle swarm\noptimization algorithm is proposed. The principle of the algorithm is to use the trigonometric\nfunction to improve the dynamic mode of inertia weight (!) with time, so that ! remains a\nlarger value at the beginning of the algorithm. As the algorithm runs down, keeps !smaller, the\nparticle swarm global search ability is eﬀectively improved, and the convergence performance is\neﬀectively improved.\nDuring the search of the IPSO algorithm, the inertia weight !is continuously adjusted, that\nis, in the initial stage of the algorithm, a larger value is taken, and as the algorithm continues to\ndecrement the value of !, it is possible to ﬁnd the better seed in the global scope. In the later\nstage of the algorithm, if ! is small, it can ensure that the particle is searched in the vicinity of\nthe extreme point. The accuracy of the convergence of this algorithm is greatly improved [21].\nBased on the above analysis, according to the characteristics of the sum, the inertia weight !\nis adjusted so that the change formula of !is shown in (3):\n!1(t + 1) = [0:65 + 0:25 \u0002 cos(\u0019\u0002 t=tmax)] \u0002 [a \u0002 sin(2\u0019\u0002 t=tmax) + 1]; (3)\nwhere, !1(t + 1) represents the t + 1th inertia weight value obtained by t iterations, a is the\nadjustment factor, the value range is a > 0, after a number of data experiments to determine\na = 0:02 in this paper.\nTherefore, the particle swarm speed is updated as (4):\nvt+1\ni = !3(t + 1) \u0001 vt\ni + c1r1(pt\nbest \u0000 Xt\ni ) + c2r2(gt\nbest \u0000 Xt\ni ): (4)\nIn order to ensure that the position change of the particles is in the proper range, the speed of\nthe particles is adjusted according to (5), so that it is controlled within the maximum speed:\nvt+1\ni = min\n(\nVmax; max(\u0000Vmax; vt+1\ni )\n)\n: (5)\nIn this paper, the optimization performance of the IPSO algorithm is tested. This experiment\nuses the classical Griewank test function to test the optimization of the algorithm !1 \u0000 PSO,\n!2 \u0000 PSO and !3 \u0000 PSO. Where the global minimum value of the function is 0, the particle\nnumber of the algorithm is 40, and c1 = c2 = 40, when the iteration accuracy reaches 10\u000010 or\nthe number of iterations exceeds 1 000, the optimization process ends. The process is shown in\nFig. 1(b).\nVol. 68 (2019) Fault diagnosis of power transformer based on improved 165\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 1. Inertia weight dynamic trend (a), Griewank function test for optimization\nperformance of diﬀerent algorithms (b)\n3. Transformer fault diagnosis model based on IPSO-OS-ELM\nThe OS-ELM has the advantages of fast learning speed, good generalization performance and\nhigh classiﬁcation accuracy, but its classiﬁcation performance is aﬀected by random parameters\nof the network, input weights and the thresholds, so the network output is unstable. The IPSO\nalgorithm has the advantage of using simple and easy operations to get the best value. Therefore,\nthe paper uses the IPSO algorithm to select the input weight and deviation of the hidden layer,\nand uses the generalized matrix analysis to calculate the output weight. In the improved particle\nswarm optimization algorithm, the inertia coeﬃcient changes linearly with time, and the ﬁtness\nof each particle is obtained by the average error.\nThe speciﬁc optimization process is as follows:\n1. Initialize the particle swarm to randomly deﬁne the initial position and speed of each\nparticle.\n2. Determine the ﬁtness; calculate the ﬁtness of each particle.\n166 Y. Li, L. Ma Arch. Elect. Eng.\n3. Compare the position of the optimal ﬁtness of each particle, and update its position.\n4. Compare the position of the optimal ﬁtness of each particle, and update its position.\n5. Adjust the speed and position of the particles.\n6. If the termination condition is reached, the process ends; otherwise, step 2 is continued.\nThe core idea of the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for optimizing the\nOS-ELM algorithm is to optimize the parameters in the OS-ELM.\nThe ﬁtness function of the particle swarm is obtained by (6):\nFRMSE =\nvuuuuuuuut\nN∑\nj=1\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\nL∑\nj=1\n\fig(!i \u0001 xj + bi) \u0000 ti\n\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\n2\n2\nmN : (6)\nThe speciﬁc ﬂow chart of the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm for optimizing\nthe OS-ELM algorithm is shown in Fig. 2(a).\nAfter optimization by the IPSO algorithm, we obtain the parameters of the optimized OS-\nELM model, and then we use these parameters to construct the transformer fault diagnosis model\nbased on the IPSO-OS-ELM algorithm. The diagnosis model is shown in Fig. 2(b).\n(a)\nFig. 2.\nVol. 68 (2019) Fault diagnosis of power transformer based on improved 167\n(b)\nFig. 2. Improved particle swarm optimization algorithm optimizing the parameters\nof OS-ELM algorithm (a); fault diagnosis model based on IPSO-OS-ELM (b)\n4. Experiment and result analysis\nThe experiment was run on Windows 7 64-bits and on Matlab R2016a. In the experiment,\nthe 4182 data collected from the grid company was used and divided into training data and\ntest data according to a ratio of 3:1. Divide the transformer status into nine categories, such\nas, low temperature overheating (less than 150◦C), low temperature overheating ( 150\u0018300◦C),\nmedium temperature overheating ( 300\u0018700◦C), high temperature overheating (above 700◦C),\npartial discharge, low energy discharge, low energy discharge and overheating, arc discharge, arc\ndischarge and overheating. The output of the OS-ELM model is used as a classiﬁcation vector.\nThe dimension of the classiﬁcation vector is the number of state categories in the sample. The\nstate code of each class is shown in Table 1.\nSince the OS-ELM algorithm randomly selects parameters of the hidden layer, the network\noutput is not stable enough. For this problem, the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm\nis proposed to optimize the input weight and threshold of the OS-ELM. In the test, the hidden\nlayer node of the OS-ELM was set to 20 according to experience, and the control parameters were\nall set to 2.0, in which the initial inertia was 0.9 and the end inertia was 0.4. The population size of\nthe particle swarm algorithm is set to 20, and the maximum number of iterations is set to 500, so\n168 Y. Li, L. Ma Arch. Elect. Eng.\nTable 1.

The evolution curve is shown\nin Fig. 3.\nFig. 3. IPSO optimizes OS-ELM parameters\nIt can be seen that when the IPSO algorithm optimizes the OS-ELM, the optimal classiﬁcation\naccuracy rate is 97.9% in the 125th generation, and the classiﬁcation accuracy rate reaches a high\nlevel, which has a good eﬀect. Therefore, the parameters adopted in the IPSO-OS-ELM fault\ndiagnosis model of this paper are the parameters generated after 125 iterations optimization.\nThe parameters selected by the optimized OS-ELM algorithm are as follows: the number of\nneurons in hidden layer L, set the size of the dataset N0 = 100 during training, and the size of the\ndata block BLOCK = 10 during the learning process.\nThe training time of the IPSO-OS-ELM diagnostic model varies with the number of neurons\nin the hidden layer as shown in Fig. 4(a):\nVol. 68 (2019) Fault diagnosis of power transformer based on improved 169\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4.

Li, L. Ma Arch. Elect. Eng.\nNext, in the same experimental environment and experimental data, the fault diagnosis model\nbased on the ELM and OS-ELM algorithm is compared with the IPSO-OS-ELM model proposed\nin this paper.\nThe training time and classiﬁcation accuracy of the three models are shown in Fig. 5(a) and\nFig. 5(b), respectively.\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 5. Comparison of the training time of the three fault diagnosis models (a),\ncomparison of the accuracy rate of the three fault diagnosis models (b)\nIt can be seen from the experimental results that the training time of the transformer fault\ndiagnosis model based on the IPSO-OS-ELM algorithm is less than that required by the ELM\nand OS-ELM, as well as the achieved accuracy (highest accuracy is 93.25%) is better than the\nELM (the highest accuracy is 89.09%) and OS-ELM (highest accuracy rate of 91.77%), that is,\nthe model proposed in this paper has better performance in transformer fault diagnosis.\nVol. 68 (2019) Fault diagnosis of power transformer based on improved 171\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is improved and applied to the\ntransformer fault diagnosis model based on the OS-ELM. The problem of randomly selecting\nparameters in the hidden layer and the network output is not stable enough in the OS-ELM was\nsolved by optimization, which improves the diagnosis accuracy and stability of the transformer\nfault diagnosis model.
