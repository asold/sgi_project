First, a normalized real coefﬁcient ﬁlter\nis transformed into a complex coefﬁcient ﬁlter, which includes\nimaginary-valued resistors by using a proposed frequency trans-\nformation. Second, a complex ﬁlter using passive elements is\npresented. The proposed circuit consists of terminating resistors,\ncapacitors, and transformers with ﬁnite self-inductances and\ncoupling coefﬁcients equal to or less than unity. A third-order\ncomplex Chebyshev bandpass ﬁlter is designed using practical\npassive elements, and its frequency response is measured. It is\nshown that the experimental circuit exhibits bandpass character-\nistics (90–110 kHz) and an image rejection of 53 dB.\nIndex Terms— Bandpass ﬁlter (BPF), complex, ﬁlter, passive,\ntransformer.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nA\nN ANALOG ﬁlter is one of the most important building\nblocks in communication systems. The most fundamental\nﬁlter is an LC ﬁlter. Since it exhibits a low noise property and\nprovides a desirable frequency response over a wide frequency\nrange, it is widely used in the front-end circuits of radio systems.\nHowever, the inductor in an LC ﬁlter is unsuitable for integra-\ntion. In particular, the element value of the inductor becomes\nhigh when the operation frequency of the LC ﬁlter is relatively\nlow. To solve this problem, many RC-active ﬁlters have been\nproposed [1]–[3]. An RC-active ﬁlter has a cascade conﬁgura-\ntion of the second-order sections such as the Sallen–Key circuit\n[1], Biquad circuit [2], and so on. This structure is employed\nbecause the number of active elements in it is relatively small.\nThe problem with this structure is that a high-order ﬁlter has\nhigh sensitivity. Another method is to simulate a doubly termi-\nnated LC ﬁlter by using an RC-active circuit; this type of ﬁlter\ncan inherit the low-sensitivity property of the prototypeLC ﬁlter\n[3]. The synthesizing theory of an LC ﬁlter has been accom-\nplished; however, it remains a fundamental theory for modern\nactive ﬁlter design.\nThe above-mentioned ﬁlter is a real coefﬁcient ﬁlter (real\nﬁlter) whose frequency response is symmetrical with respect\nto dc\n. Recently, many techniques with regard to\ncomplex coefﬁcient ﬁlters (complex ﬁlters) have been proposed\nin order to realize high-performance signal processing. This\ncomplex ﬁlter has two input terminals: real and imaginary\ninput terminals. As a result, the complex ﬁlter has an unsym-\nManuscript received October 12, 2006; revised April 13, 2007.

This property\nis important for applications in the ﬁeld of communication\nsystems, e.g., orthogonal communication systems, such as\northogonal modulation/demodulation, image rejection ﬁlters,\nand so on. Many methods have been proposed for designing\ncomplex ﬁlters [4]–[13]. A polyphase ﬁlter [4], [5] is suitable\nfor integrated circuits since it has only capacitors and resistors.\nHowever, the resistors lead to power dissipation. As a result, the\nRC polyphase network has a comparatively high transmission\nloss.\nA frequency-shifting method [6], [8]–[13] simply shifts the\nfrequency response of the prototype ﬁlter along the direction\nof the frequency axis. As a result, the frequency response is\nsymmetrical with respect to the shifting frequency [6]. Ex-\ntended frequency transformations [7] convert the frequency\naxis of the prototype ﬁlter to that of a complex ﬁlter by using a\nbilinear function. These methods generate an imaginary valued\nresistor called an imaginary resistor. Its resistance is a constant,\npure, and imaginary value, regardless of the frequency; in\nother words, it is not a practical component. Therefore, the\nmost important problem is to equivalently realize an imaginary\nresistor by using practical components. An imaginary resistor\ncan be equivalently realized by using a gyrator [12]. How-\never, it is difﬁcult to realize a gyrator using practical passive\nelements because of its reciprocity. An imaginary resistor can\nalso be equivalently realized by using ideal transformers [13].\nIn this paper, the frequency-shifting method is used to design\nthe prototype ﬁlter. Unfortunately, the resulting complex ﬁlter\nrequires an ideal transformer—a transformer with inﬁnite\nself-inductance. Therefore, it is also difﬁcult to realize this ﬁlter\nby using practical passive components. As described above,\nmost of the conventional complex ﬁlters inevitably require\nactive elements. However, the investigation of passive complex\nﬁlters is important from the viewpoint of their active realization\nin the same way as conventional real ﬁlters.\nThis paper proposes complex ﬁlters using practical passive\ncomponents. The proposed frequency transformation method\nis suitable for passive realization. The resulting complex ﬁlter\nincludes terminating resistors, capacitors, and transformers\nwith ﬁnite self-inductances. Further, as a design example,\na third-order complex Chebyshev bandpass ﬁlter (BPF) is\ndesigned using practical passive elements, and its frequency\nresponse is measured.\nII. D\nESIGN METHODOLOGY\nA. Proposed Frequency Transformation\nConventionally, a real BPF is designed by using a low-pass\nﬁlter (LPF)–BPF transformation. In this technique, the fre-\nquency axis of a normalized real LPF is converted to that of\n1549-8328/$25.00 © 2008 IEEE\n1898 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS—I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 55, NO. 7, AUGUST 2008\nFig. 1. Proposed transformation.\na real BPF. The proposed complex ﬁlter is also designed by\nusing a frequency transformation. Fig. 1 shows the proposed\nfrequency transformation. In this ﬁgure, the frequency axis\nof the real ﬁlter is converted to that of the complex ﬁlter.\nBecause the proposed ﬁlter is obtained only by frequency\ntransformation, the passband ripple\n of the proposed ﬁlter is\nthe same as that of the normalized real LPF. The function\nis deﬁned as\n(1)\n(2)\nwhere\n is a real constant, and\n is the coupling coefﬁ-\ncient of the transformer. For the practical transformer,\n may be\ngreater than 0.9. In particular, the value of\n for the transformer\nused in the experiment described in Section III is approximately\n0.94. Equation (2) is introduced to simplify the synthesis of the\ncomplex ﬁlter. Therefore,\nand\n are the values obtained from\nthe components included in the resulting complex ﬁlter. From\nFig. 1, the following simultaneous equations can be obtained:\n(3)\nFor\n ,w eh a v e\n(4)\nwhere\n, and\n . Fig. 2(a) shows the normalized real\nLPF.

Table I summarizes\nthe element transformations given by (5) and (6). From Table I,\nit is found that the resulting complex ﬁlter includes the element\nwith an impedance of either\n or\n . It is referred to as an\nimaginary resistor. The imaginary resistor has a purely imagi-\nnary resistance, regardless of the frequency\n. Therefore, this\nelement is not a practical element. The prototype ﬁlter shown in\nFig. 2(a) is transformed to the complex ﬁlter shown in Fig. 2(b)\nthrough the proposed frequency transformation.\nSHOUNO AND ISHIBASHI: SYNTHESIS OF A PASSIVE COMPLEX FILTER USING TRANSFORMERS 1899\nFig. 3. (a) Imaginary resistor. (b) Imaginary resistor realized by using an ideal\ntransformer.\nB. Imaginary Resistor\nThe circuit equation of the imaginary resistor\n shown in\nFig. 3(a) has the following form:\n(7)\nThe voltage\n and current\n can be decomposed into their real\nand imaginary components\n(8)\nThe subscripts\n and\n denote the real and imaginary signal\npaths, respectively. This means that the complex ﬁlter has real\nand imaginary circuits. Substituting (8) into (7) yields\n(9)\nWhen this equation is regarded as a\n -matrix, which indicates\nthe relationship between the ports\n and\n , its conﬁguration re-\nveals that the imaginary resistor can be equivalently realized by\nusing a gyrator with a gyration resistance of\n[12]. Now, we\nintroduce\n and\n deﬁned as follows:\n(10)\nwhere\n is a positive constant. It should be noted that (10)\nimplies that the current and voltage are interchanged in the\nimaginary circuit. Therefore, the imaginary circuit must repre-\nsent a dual of the real circuit. Substituting (10) into (9) yields\n(11)\nThis equation is in the\n -matrix form. Rewriting it in an\n -ma-\ntrix form yields\n(12)\nIt should be noted that the sign of\n is inverted since the cur-\nrent direction of the\n -matrix is opposite to that of the\n -ma-\ntrix. Equation (12) represents an ideal transformer embedded\nbetween the real and imaginary circuits. Therefore, the imag-\ninary resistor shown Fig. 3(a) can be equivalently realized by\nusing the ideal transformer whose turn ratio is\nas\nshown in Fig. 3(b) [13].\nThe dual circuit [14] shown in Fig. 4(b) can be obtained as\nfollows. When the relationship between two elements\n and\nis given by\n , they act as dual elements, as listed\nin Table II. The dual of the original circuit shown in Fig. 4(a)\ncan be obtained using the following procedure.\nStep 1) Place nodes 1–6 inside each loop and node 7 outside\nthe real circuit.\nStep 2) Draw dotted lines connecting two nodes through the\nelements in the original circuit.\nStep 3) Assign the elements traversed by the dotted lines to\ntheir dual elements, as listed in Table II.\nFig. 4(b) shows the resulting dual circuit. The ideal transformers\ncouple the real and imaginary circuits. The polarities\nof transformer\n can be determined through the following pro-\ncedure.\nStep 1) Assume that the current ﬂows in the clockwise direc-\ntion around node 2, as shown in Fig. 4(a).1 We place\na node on the side of the coil from which current\nﬂows inward.\nStep 2) The polarity of the secondary winding is assumed\nsuch that current ﬂows into node 2 of the dual circuit.\nThis means that we place a node on the side of the\ncoil from which the current ﬂows outward.\nThe above procedure can be applied to the other ideal trans-\nformers\nand\n for nodes 4 and 5. A combination of the cir-\ncuit shown in Fig. 4(a) with that shown in 4(b) yields the com-\nplex ﬁlter shown in Fig. 5. In this ﬁgure,\nis set to unity for\nsimplicity. For\n , the input resistances\n of the real cir-\ncuit is the same as\n of the imaginary circuit. 2 Under this\ncondition, the amplitude of\n is the same as that of\n.\nC.

The deviations between the desired and measured\nelement values are within 0.5%. Fig. 8 shows the transformer\nconstructed for experimental purposes. As shown in this ﬁgure,\nthe transformer is realized by using a ferrite pot core. In order to\nreduce the coupling capacitance between the primary and sec-\nondary windings, the bobbin is equipped with a separator. The\nbobbin is a Delrin rod shaped using a turning lathe. As a result,\nthe coupling capacitance is reduced. The measured value of\nis\napproximately 0.94. Fig. 9 shows the experimental results ob-\ntained by the measurement technique described in [16], [17].\nThe experimental results show that the proposed ﬁlter exhibits\na complex bandpass response and an image rejection of 53 dB. It\nis found that the deviation between the measured and ideal fre-\nquency responses is caused due to the parasitic elements. In this\nﬁgure, the parasitic elements include the dissipation and cou-\npling capacitances of the transformers.\nFig. 8. Transformer constructed for experiment.\nFig. 9. Experimental results.

Generally, from the viewpoint\nof application purposes, it is desirable that the image rejection\nbe as large as possible.

Therefore, it is desirable\nto use a transformer with the highest possible value of\n .I f\nit is difﬁcult to use such a transformer, then a higher order\nnormalized real low-pass prototype ﬁlter can be used.\nFig. 11 shows the calculated results of the worst case sensitiv-\nities of the gain to the variation of the elements included in the\nproposed and the conventional circuits [13]. It should be noted\nthat the conventional circuit cannot be realized by using only\nthe practical passive components because ideal transformers are\nrequired. From Fig. 11, it is found that both the circuits have\nsimilar sensitivity characteristics. In particular, for the negative\nfrequencies near\nkHz, they possess very high sensitivity.\nThis implies that the proposed method also requires very small\nelement tolerances and the absence of noticeable parasitic ele-\nments when high image rejection is required.\nIV . C\nONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a passive complex ﬁlter has been proposed. The\nproposed circuit is obtained by using a frequency transformation\ntechnique different from the conventional frequency-shifting\nmethod. The proposed frequency transformation is suitable\nfor passive realization. The resulting complex ﬁlter includes\npassive components, namely, transformers, capacitors, and\nterminating resistors.\nAs an example, a third-order complex ﬁlter has been de-\nsigned. Since the value of\ninﬂuences the image rejection,\nit is desirable that we use a transformer with the highest\npossible value of\n from the viewpoint of its manufacturing\ncost. The transformer included in the experimental circuit is\nrealized using a ferrite pot core. The transformer functions as\nan imaginary resistor including the surrounding inductors; the\ncombination of this transformer and the surrounding capaci-\ntors can be used to realize the proposed complex ﬁlter. The\nproposed method has been validated through experiments. The\nexperimental results are in good agreement with the simulated\nfrequency characteristics. Further investigation is required to\neliminate the transformers from the passive complex ﬁlter.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] R. P. Sallen and E. L.
