INTRODUCTION\nEskom is the state owned power utility in South Africa and\nis the biggest single generator, transmitter and distributor\nof electricity in Africa. Its Distribution Division comprises\nof nine operating units and contains a power transformer\nﬂeet of over 4000 transformers which range from 1-160\nMV A with a maximum voltage of 132 kV .\nA transformer forms a major portion of the capital\ninvestment required for a substation and therefore the life\nmanagement of this asset cannot be over-emphasized. The\nspeciﬁed life span of a power transformer employed in\nEskom’s distribution network is 40 years when operated\nat rated condition. This life span can be exceeded\ndepending on various factors including design safety\nmargins, operation, maintenance, and good life cycle\nmanagement practices from the initial installation of the\ntransformer. Conversely, the lack of transformer life cycle\nmanagement can reduce the life span of a transformer.\nHealth or condition assessments are a key ingredient in the\nlifecycle management of the transformer ﬂeet. It allows\nfor customization of maintenance plans for transformers\ndepending on their condition rating. This optimises\nresources and allows for early detection of faults while\nallowing sufﬁcient time to plan interventions to address\nproblematic transformers. An accurate health index is\ntherefore imperative for effective transformer life cycle\nmanagement.\nThis paper presents an index from available oil sample data\nto categorise the health of a transformer. The transformer\nhealth index endeavours to improve on the shortcomings\nof simpliﬁed indices by including short to medium term\ninformation. It uses the available data more appropriately\nthan using parts of indices available in literature. The\nhealth index would be used as an indicator for intervention\nVol.109 (3) September 2018SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n160\nand maintenance of the transformer or in some cases for\nthe replacement of an end of life transformer.\nThe paper further presents a risk index to account for\nknown causes of failures or known issues. The risk\nindex allows for the correct monitoring, maintenance and\nreplacement plans accordingly.\nThe paper is arranged in the following manner. Section\n2 provides an introduction and contribution of the paper.\nSection 2 provides information on transformer health\nindices from various authors and how they have developed\nthem. Section 3 provides information on ageing and\nbreakdown mechanisms of transformers (i.e. what the risk\nis). Section 4 presents details on the development of the\nhealth index, network index, ancillary equipment index\nand the risk index. Section 5 presents a case study on the\n2. TRANSFORMER HEALTH INDEX\nTransformer health assessments should be based on\nfour parameters, namely, the paper life, dissolved gas\nanalysis (DGA), condition of the auxiliary components and\nelectrical diagnostic tests. Saha presented a review on\nthe modern diagnostic techniques used for the condition\nof a transformer, noting that time-based maintenance\nprogrammes are outdated and that condition based is a\nbetter option [1]. He noted that paper and DGA are the\nmost useful for practical applications. Often, there is\nlimited availability to assess the condition of the auxiliary\ncomponents and electrical diagnostic tests due to outage\nconstraints and/or a lack of resources.\nThe plant health index (PHI) is a convenient tool to\ncombine the condition monitoring data into categories\nrelated to the asset’s condition and provides a snapshot\nof the condition of the transformer. This allows for the\nplanned implementation of corrective actions [2, 3].\nArshad and Islam [4] presented their work on the\nimportance of using cellulose as a condition assessment\ntool, they emphasized the importance of the water content\non ageing of the paper in the transformer. They presented\na case study of a power transformer that demonstrated\nthe importance of monitoring the activity around paper\nand the gases formed. This demonstrates the importance\nof understanding the degree of polymerisation in the\ntransformer.\nNaderian et al [2, 3] presented the most comprehensive\nwork on a health index for power transformers and\nextended on the typical quantities such as DGA, oil quality,\nfurfural and power factor to include other operational\nconditions, observations and history performance. They\nused a set of 20 inputs that are weighted according to\nimportance. Importantly the furan analysis has a lower\nweighting than the DGA, power factor and load history.\nThe also include the on load tap changer (OLTC) in their\nhealth index. Their health index gives an approximate\npercentage health where 100% is a perfectly healthy\ntransformer. They further relate the health index to\nthe expected lifetime and what the requirements are for\nmaintenance or replacement. Haema et al [5] adjusted the\nweightings of this health index using over 21 factors. The\nDGA again outweighs the furan; they do include the on\nload tap changer in their condition assessment. Satriyadi\nHernanda et al [6] also use the Naderian et al model for\ntheir health index. They also rate the DGA higher than\nboth the oil quality and furan.\nMiletic [7] presented work on medium voltage transform-\ners where he combined the history, a visual inspection and\na diagnostic inspection to formulate his index. The history\nincluded the age, loading, fault and maintenance criteria.\nThe visual inspection included any identiﬁable defects.\nThe diagnostic included infrared assessment, oil quality\nand winding tests (this is an ofﬂine test). Although the\nentire health index was not shown in the paper, there were\nhigh weightings for the age, faults history and winding test\nand he highlighted that the cumulative damage caused by\nthrough faults was important consideration for the health\nof the transformer.\nMalik et al [8] presented a health index that looked at two\nindices, namely, tier 1 which considers oil analysis, power\nfactor and excitation current, operation and maintenance\nhistory and age, and tier 2 which considers turns ratio and\nSFRA. Tier 2 is ofﬂine, whereas tier could be done online.\nThe study included information about furan analysis and\nthey combined this with the generation of individual gas\nconcentrations and the generation of the total dissolved\ncombustible gases as a score.\nTaengko et al [9] developed a health index based on\nhistorical (loading, age, fault history) and condition factors\n(ofﬂine and online) tests. They determined the overall HI\nusing a matrix that correlates the two sets of information\nto determine the health of the transformer.\nScatiggio and Pompili [10] have developed a health\nindex that combines transformer dependent data such as\ndielectric and thermal conditions (DGA, furan), mechani-\ncal condition (Sweep Frequency Response Analysis), oil\ncondition and non-transformer dependent data such as\nlightning frequency, substation layout, and re-occurrence\nof events at the site. They do not give details in this\npaper of the non-transformer dependent data; this is of\nimportance for determining the risk of the transformer.\nThey showed that the age of the transformer cannot be\nused alone in determining the condition of the transformer.\nThey further presented an extension of the work to consider\nthe number of dangerous events, and average damage per\nevent with the health index to quantify the risk to the\ntransformers [11]. This is an important consideration as\nexternal aspects such as lightning ground ﬂash density,\nfault level at the transformer, climatic conditions can be\nconsidered part of the overall health index.\nHeywood and McGrail [12] compared a linear health index\nto a logarithmic health index. They used 10 inputs with\na linear score of 0 (good) - 10 (poor) and a logarithmic\nindex with a score from 1 (good) - 100 (poor). They\nVol.109 (3) September 2018 SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n161\nindicate that for the linear scale the scores for different\ntransformers and problems could be similar, whereas when\nusing the logarithmic scale, more speciﬁc problems can be\nidentiﬁed.\nOne of the issues of the published information is that\nthere are too many factors and as such it is difﬁcult to get\nthe weighting correct. There is no standard for which to\nadhere and all the weighting factors differ dependent on\nthe region they are applied in. For large ﬂeet sizes of power\ntransformers it is not always practical that all factors can be\ntaken into account.\nSingh [13] undertook an investigation of the PHI used\nby Eskom on its power transformer ﬂeet. The PHI\nwas proposed by Geldenhuis [14] and used a simple\ncombination of 60% degree of polymerisation (DP), 30%\nDGA (using only Total Dissolved Combustible Gases)\nand 10% moisture in paper to quantify the health of the\ntransformer into four health categories. The PHI was\nweighted in favour of the DP and as such it really only\nconsiders the long term health of the transformers. A case\nstudy on failed transformers identiﬁed that healthy units\nhad failed when they could have been detected as there\nwere indications of an upcoming fault in the DGA, the oil\nwas of poor quality and that the installation environment\ncould have been used to identify risky transformers.\nThe PHI should form one input into a transformer risk\nindex that also considers previous failures at site, external\nfactors such as the location, lightning density and earth\nresistance, and network performance.\n3. TRANSFORMER AGEING AND FAILURE\nMECHANISM\nA transformer is in general made from non-ageing\nmaterials except for the insulation system. The copper\nconductors are insulated with normal cellulose Kraft\npaper or thermally upgraded paper. The insulation\ndistances between the coils and between the coils and\nthe yokes/clamping structures are ﬁlled with other solid\ninsulation, and the entire active part is immersed in\ninsulation oil. The insulation oil and the solid insulation\nof the transformer deteriorate with age.\nMineral insulating oils contain mixtures of hydrocarbon\nmolecules and are made up of the CH\n3, CH2 and CH\nchemical groups. Gas molecules are formed due to the\ndegradation of the oil and include Hydrogen (H\n2), Methane\n(CH4), Ethane ( C2H6), Ethylene ( C2H4), and Acetylene\n(C2H2) [15].\nThe formation of the gases is dependent on temperature\nwhere at low temperatures H\n2, CH4 and C2H6 may form,\nat intermediate temperatures C2H4 may form and at high\ntemperatures (such as when arcing occurs) C2H2 is formed\n[15].\nThe insulating oil ages in the presence of oxygen, heat and\nmoisture. Breakdown of the oil results in the production\nof acid, moisture and sludge which impacts the integrity\nof the paper, reduces circulation and cooling, and further\nworsens the rate of ageing of the oil. Oil quality\nmeasurements such as electric strength, interfacial tension,\nand moisture in oil, acidity, and dissipation factor are used\nto determine the suitability of the oil to perform its function\nin the transformer.\nThe insulating paper is made up of chains of polymers\ncalled furans. Longer chains equate to the greater integrity\nof the paper and when the paper deteriorates, these chains\nbreak down and dissolve in the oil. The furans in the oil\nare thus used to estimate the degree of polymerization (DP)\nof the paper insulation in a transformer. Alternatively, the\ndegree of polymerization can be determined by analysing\na sample of the paper insulation of the transformer but\nthis comes with operational complications as the process\nis intrusive and involves removing the transformer from\nservice. Estimation of the DP is therefore favoured by\nmany utilities. New Kraft paper has a DP of around 1200\nwhile paper with a DP approaching 200 has little remaining\nstrength and is considered as approaching the end of its\nuseful life [16].\nThe thermal degradation of paper insulation leads to the\nproduction of Carbon Dioxide ( CO\n2) at low temperatures\nand Carbon Monoxide ( CO) at high temperatures. Oxygen\n(O2) and Nitrogen (N 2) are additionally present in the oil,\nbut are not formed due to the degradation processes. The\nformation of CO2 and CO are however dependent on the\namount of O2 in the oil [15].\nWhile aged oil can be replaced or regenerated, there is\nno economical way of replacing the insulating paper, and\ntherefore when it reaches its end of life, the transformer is\nconsidered to have reached the end of its useful life [16].\nThe ageing of transformers is best measured in terms of\nthe insulating paper. DP should be measured and trended\nto monitor the rate of ageing such that informed decisions\ncan be made regarding the replacement of the transformer\nbefore the insulating system fails. Transformers that reach\ntheir end of life in this manner are generally regarded\nas success stories as they provide a return on the capital\ninvestment outlaid for their installation.\nThe fundamental cause of paper ageing is heat which is\ngenerated by losses when the transformer is loaded. The\nageing rate is accelerated by the presence of moisture\nand/or oxygen. There are various sources of moisture\nin the insulation system, which can either be external\n(atmospheric air through leaks or air ingress during\nmaintenance), internal (as a by-product of ageing), or\nresidual (improper drying at the factory). The main source\nof oxygen is from the atmosphere and is the primary\nreason that air bags are ﬁtted in the conservator of modern\ntransformers. The bag limits the exposure of the oil and\npaper to oxidation by conﬁning the oxygen to the bag and\noccupying the space that would ordinarily be ﬁlled with\nair [17].\nThe effect of temperature on the ageing of the paper,\nVol.109 (3) September 2018SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n162\nand hence the effective remaining life of transformers is\ndescribed by the Arrhenius equation, which shows that for\nan increase of 6 ◦C above 110 ◦C, the life of insulation is\nhalved [17, 18].\nEskom considers a DP of 200 as end of life, transformers\nare speciﬁed for a 40 year life.\nThe ageing is signiﬁcantly more complicated in operation\nas the transformer load varies throughout the day and\nbetween different types of customers (e.g., domestic versus\nindustrial). Over time, the transformer may develop leaks\nwhich may increase the moisture in oil and paper. This will\ncause premature ageing of the paper, and oil which may\nthen result in the formation of sludge and more moisture\nthat will have further negative effects on the transformer\nlifespan.\n3.1 Failure Mechanisms\nFailures in transformers consist of infant mortality failures\nwhich occur early on in a transformer life and wear out\nfailures where the rate of failure typically increases with\nthe age of the transformer.\nTransformers may fail prematurely for several reasons.\nThis includes mechanical failures from short circuit\nactivity, failure of transformer components such as\nbushings and tapchangers, manufacturing defects and\nincorrect application of the transformer by the user.\nFailure of ancillary components such as OLTC and\ntransformer bushings often result in the failure of the\ntransformer. There is also a great risk of ﬁre when oil\ntype tap changers and bushings fail. Modern vacuum tap\nchangers are oil free and have reduced the maintenance\nrequirements. Resin impregnated paper (RIP) or synthetics\n(RIS) have reduced the maintenance requirements as they\nare oil free.\nCigre Working Group A2 [19] presented a reliability study\nin 2015 where they categorised the failures of transformers\nover a number of years according to position of failure,\nfailure mode and failure cause. Key ﬁndings for the\ntransformers with highest voltage of 200 kV:\n• Position of failure: For all transformers below 200 kV ,\n59% failures occurred on the windings and 33% on\nthe tapchangers and bushings. For transformers below\n100 kV , 89% of the failures occurred on windings and\n8% on the tapchangers and bushings.\n• Failure mode: For all transformers below 200 kV ,\n40% are dielectric failures and 20% are mechanical\nfailures. For transformers below 100 kV , 70% are\ndielectric failures.\n• Failure cause: For all transformers below 200 kV ,\n15% of failures were due to ageing, 15% due\nto an external short circuit and 10% due to poor\nmaintenance. For transformers below 100 kV , 25%\nof failures are due to an external short circuit.\nIt is clear that these transformers are greatly impacted by\nfaults on the network as the majority of faults occurred on\nthe windings, with dielectric failure the main mode and\ncaused by short circuit. The severity of the impact of\nthe fault on the transformer depends also on the distance\nof the fault from the transformer, as the fault current\nis damped by the impedance of the conductors on the\ndistribution system. The transformer is under constant\nmagnetic forces that are withstood under rated conditions\nby the mechanical clamping, bracing and build of the\ntransformer. Under fault conditions, the current seen by the\ntransformer exceeds rated values. The force experienced\nby the transformer is proportional to the square of the\ncurrent. Increased or regular fault current occurrence\nimpacts on the mechanical integrity of the transformer\n[20]. The impact may result in reduced clearances, shorted\nturns and deformed windings which may lead to dielectric\nfailure.\nOommen presented a case study on the causes of premature\nfailure of transformers on the Eskom transmission\nnetwork in 2005 [21], where she illustrated that there\nwere numerous incidents of through faults attributed to\ninadequate protection, inadequate clearances on the feeder,\nauto-reclosing selection and inadequate maintenance\npractices on the line. Although this is at the transmission\nlevel, the distribution level follows the same pattern.\nMechanical failures are prominent on poor performing\nnetworks and it is imperative that the substation protection\nis functioning and correctly graded to prevent such failures.\nIn extreme cases fault limiting reactors may be employed\nto restrict the fault current.\nOther faults internal to the transformer such as thermal\nfaults (hotspots) and partial discharges may develop\ninto more serious conditions that eventually lead to the\ndielectric breakdown of the transformer insulation.\nThese faults can be monitored via the analysis of the gases\nin the transformer oil and from electrical tests on the\ntransformer.\n4. PLANT HEALTH INDEX\nIndications of the condition of transformers and its\ncomponents are possible by the collection and analysis of\ndata pertaining to the operation of the transformer.\nThe PHI was developed from readily available pertinent\ndata. It was designed to best use the data most available\nto the operator without impacting on system operation\n(i.e. data from the transformer oil that could be obtained\nwithout switching transformer off). The PHI focussed on\nthe insulation in the transformer as this has the highest\nfailure mode.\nA network index (NI) and ancillary equipment index (AI)\nwere added to the PHI to give a risk index (RI). The\npredominant cause of failure is the short circuit due to\nnetwork and fault conditions. AI was included to account\nfor failure of bushings and tapchangers.\nVol.109 (3) September 2018 SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n163\nDielectric\nstrength\nAcidity\nMoisture in\noil\nMax\nBGR\nLTPHI\nTDCG\n×\n×\n×\n0.4\n0.3\n0.3\nΣ\nOil Quality\n0-30\nMoisture in\npaper\n1-4\nDGA\n0.3-6.8\nDP\n1-4\nScore\n×\n×\n×\n×\n0.1\n0-3\n0.3\n0.3-1.2\n0.3\n0.1-2\n0.3\n0.3-1.2\nWeight\nΣ PHI\n0 - 7.4\nIndex\nFault Level\n0-2\nNetwork\nPerformance\n0-6\nAncillary\nEquipment\n0-1\n×\n×\n0.3\n0 - 0.6\n0.3\n0 - 1.8\nΣ NI\n0 - 2.4\nAI\n0-1\nΣ\nRisk Index\nRI\n0-10\nFigure 1: Plant Health Index and Transformer Risk Index\nIn IEEE standard C57.104, the interpretation of gas levels\nis deﬁned into four condition levels related to the key gas\nconcentration levels and the TDCG. The PHI and RI were\nsimilarly developed with four levels:\n• Category A (0-1) - Healthy transformer or no risk\ntransformer\n• Category B (1-2) - Moderately healthy transformer or\nlow risk transformer\n• Category C (2-3) - Moderate to unhealthy transformer\nor medium risk transformer\n• Category D (>3) - Unhealthy transformer or high risk\ntransformer\nA score was assigned according to a condition assessment\nof a parameter with a value of 1 - 4. The overall\nPHI would be sum of a percentage (a weight) of the\nparameters’ scores. There were, however, instances where\na higher score was used for the parameter to ensure that the\ntransformer would be categorised as unhealthy. The health\nindices used by other authors in Section 2 are generally\nweighted overall and a very poor score in one area may not\nbe able to detect a failing. Due to the parameters available,\na cumulative score would better indicate an unhealthy\ntransformer provided the input scores and weightings were\ncorrect.\nTable 1: Priority chart for parameter scores\nParameter Comment\nDGA Short to medium term, can indicate\noverall health or a fault, problem can be\nidentiﬁed and ﬁxed.

A score of 1-4\nis used where 4 indicates the end of life of a transformer,\nand has a weight of 0.3 in the PHI. The expected life\nof a transformer in the Eskom Distribution network is 40\nyears and it is not expected that the paper will degrade to\ncatastrophic proportions in the ﬁrst 10 to 15 years, even if\nhighly loaded. The DP is a long term assessment of the\nVol.109 (3) September 2018SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n164\nTable 2: Scoring of DP assessment\nDegree of Polymerisation Score\nHealthy DP > 900 1\nModerate deteriora-\ntion\n350 < DP ≤\n-20age+900\n2\nExtensive deteriora-\ntion\n200 < DP ≤ 350 and\nDP> -20age+900\n3\nEnd of Life age > 35 or DP <\n200\n4\nstate of the transformer. A DP score of 4 would move the\ntransformer into the next highest PHI category.\n4.2 Dissolved Gas Analysis\nThere are several established techniques for the analysis\nof dissolved gases in transformer oil, including, amongst\nothers, the IEC Basic Gas Ratio Method, Key Gas\nMethod, Total Dissolved Gases (TDG), Total Dissolved\nCombustible Gases (TDCG), Duval’s Triangle, and\nDoernenburg’s Ratio Method. Some methods rely on the\nparts per million (ppm) of the different gases in oil for\ninterpretation while others have preferred to look at the\nratio of the various gases to each other.\nNaderian et al [3] and Taengko et al [9] used key gases for\ntheir DGA scores, Naderian et al. state that they do not\nlook at ratio methods as they are interested in a long term\nassessment. Malik et al [8] used the rate of change of gas\nconcentration, this would be the most appropriate where\navailable.\nIt is best to use multiple methods of oil analysis to\ndiagnose faults as the various methods have strengths and\nweaknesses that may compliment each other. For example,\nmethods that focus mainly on ppm values tend to struggle\nwith the early detection of faults due to their reliance on\nppm thresholds for analysis. Methods that rely solely on\nratios may provide false indications as even minor changes\nin the composition of gases may create unfavourable ratios.\nMethods such as the Duval Triangle and Key Gas Method\ndo not have a normal condition and are thus best used for\nroot cause analysis once it is known that a fault exists [22].\nFor the TDCG to detect a fault in the transformer, it\nrequires a combined ppm value for all the combustible\ngases to be greater than 430 ppm. Floating potential and\nearly stage discharge type faults are generally typiﬁed by\nlow levels of C\n2H2 (10-50 ppm) and H2 (100 ppm) with\nsmall amounts of CH4 (10-50 ppm), C2H6 (10-50 ppm) and\nC2H4 (10-50 ppm) also present. It is quite foreseeable that\nthe TDCG would incorrectly classify a transformer with\nsuch a fault condition as operating normally.\nMethods that employ analysing the ratio of the gases\npresent in the oil will negate the drawbacks of solely\nconsidering the ppm value of gases in the oil. The basic\ngas ratio and the Eskom LTPHI method be incorporated\ninto the scoring for DGA.\nThe dissolved gas analysis score consists of three\ncomponents:\n• The total dissolved combustible gases, shown in Table\n3, which carries a weight of 0.3 for the DGA score.\n• The basic gas ratio, shown in Table 4, which carries a\nweighting of 0.4 for the DGA score.\n• The LTPHI, shown in Table 5, relates the dissolved\nquantity of the individual dissolved gas to a score.\nThe highest score is used for this component and\ncarries a weight of 0.3 of the DGA score.\nTDCG is formed by adding the concentrations of H\n2, CH4,\nC2H6, C2H4, C2H2 and CO to ﬁnd the total concentration in\nppm [15,23]. IEEE Std C57.104 deﬁnes the conditions and\nthese have been used as the basis for scoring. A general\nscore of 1-4 is used, but a score of 8 is used for where\nthe TDCG is very high as this would indicate an unhealthy\n(faulty) transformer.\nTable 3: Scoring of TDCG assessment [15, 23]\nTDCG Score\nLow TDCG 1\nTDCG < 720 ppm 2\n1920 > TDCG ≥ 720 ppm 3\n4630 > TDCG ≥ 1920 ppm and CO2 less 50% 4\nTDCG ≥ 4630 ppm 8\nThe IEC deﬁnes the fault using the Basic Gas Ratio\nconsisting of CH\n4/H2 , C2H2/C2H4 and C2H4/C2H6 [15,\n23]. The resulted ratio ranges relate to codes and are\nrelated to the condition below. The condition is related\nto a score according to the severity of the fault as shown in\nTable 4. If there is no fault in the transformer, there will\nbe a score of 0, thus not inﬂuencing the DGA score. Faults\nsuch as PD: partial discharge, T1: low temperature thermal\nfaults and D1 discharges of low energy could lead to larger\nfaults in the medium term and are scored at 2 and 3. The\nhigher temperature thermal faults (T2,T3) and high energy\ndischarges (D2) are more serious faults and are assigned\na value above 4. This would push the PHI into a higher\ncategory.\nThe LTPHI score relates the individual quantities of\nthe gases to a score where the maximum value with a\nweighting of 0.3 is used for the DGA score. It is used\nto identify higher than normal concentrations of gases, the\nvalues are lower than the dissolved key gas concentrations\nconditions in IEEE Std C57.104, but the standard itself\nadvises that this may be utility dependent. When the\nlevels gases are low then the LTPHI has no impact on the\nDGA score as there is no fault condition, while there is\nVol.109 (3) September 2018 SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n165\nTable 4: Scoring of Basic Gas Ratio Assessment\nBasic Gas Ratio Score\nNone 0\nD1: Discharges of low energy 2\nD2: Discharges of high energy 5\nT1: Thermal fault of ≥ 150\n◦C and\n< 300 ◦C\n2\nT2: Thermal fault of ≥ 300 ◦C and\n< 700 ◦C\n3.5\nT3: Thermal fault of ≥ 700 ◦C5\nPD: Partial discharge 3\na maximum of 8 if one of the gases is above the deﬁned\nlimits which would indicate a fault condition. CO which\nhas the lowest scoring with a maximum of 4 as it is usually\nindicative of ageing whereas the other gases are indicative\nof faults.\nThe LTPHI is useful to cover for the shortcomings of\nusing the TDCG alone. For example C2H2 is indicative\nof arcing in a transformer and is generally present in low\nppm concentrations e.g. 50 ppm. The TDCG could give a\nscore of 2 (indicating no problem) and the LTPHI a score\nof 8. Gives a better combined score to the DGA and PHI.\nTable 5: Scoring of LTPHI assessment\nLTPHI Score\nC2H2 <5 ppm 0\n5 ppm ≤ C2H2 <15 ppm 4\n15 ppm ≤ C2H2 <35 ppm 6\n35 ppm ≤ C2H2 8\nH2<50 ppm 0\n50 ppm ≤H2<150 ppm 4\n150 ppm ≤H2<250 ppm 6\n250 ppm ≤H2 8\nC2H6<50 ppm 0\n50 ppm ≤C2H6<100 ppm 4\n100 ppm ≤C2H6<150 ppm 6\n150 ppm ≤C2H6 8\nC2H4<50 ppm 0\n50 ppm ≤C2H4<100 ppm 4\n100 ppm ≤C2H4<150 ppm 6\n150 ppm ≤C2H4 8\nCH4<75 ppm 0\n75 ppm ≤CH4<150 ppm 4\n150 ppm ≤CH4<250 ppm 6\n250 ppm ≤CH4 8\nCO<500 ppm 0\n500 ppm ≤CO<750 ppm 1\n750 ppm ≤CO<1000 ppm 2.5\n1000 ppm ≤CO 4\n4.3 Moisture in Paper\nOil moisture content and temperature of the oil are the\ncritical input variables for this assessment. Emsley et\nal [24], and Lundgaard et al [16] performed analysis\nand comparison experiments with the oil/paper insulation\nsystem for transformers, with the focus on the degree\nof polymerisation. They all demonstrated that water\naccelerates the ageing of paper.\nThe percentage moisture in paper is calculated using a\nmoisture indicator based on the Piper’s Chart [20]. Table\n6 lists the criteria and scoring of the moisture in paper and\nthe criterion. This criterion carries a weight of 0.3 of the\ntotal PHI.\nTable 6: Scoring of moisture in paper\nMoisture Score\nLow moisture 1\n3% > % Moisture per dry-weight ≥ 2% 2\n5% > % Moisture per dry-weight ≥ 3% 3\n% Moisture per dry-weight ≥ 5% 4\n4.4 Oil Quality\nThe life of the transformer is ascertained by the life of\nthe paper, which in turn is relies on the quality of the\ninsulating oil. The oil provides dielectric strength, and\nfacilitates cooling of the transformer. The quality of the\noil plays a major role in the insulation system of the\ntransformer and if it is allowed to oxidize, sludge and\ndegrade, it will place the transformer at a greater risk of\nfailure. It should therefore be represented in any health\nassessment of transformers. The key oil quality indexes\nare electric strength, moisture in the oil, acidity, dissipation\nfactor (tan delta) and interfacial tension (IFT). Only the\nelectric strength, moisture in oil and acidity are used as\nthey are readily available. The moisture in oil and acidity\nare important components of the ageing of the paper and\nhigh values lead to an increase in the rate of ageing [16].\nThe oil quality score consists of:\n• Moisture in oil, shown in Table 7\n• Electric ﬁeld strength, shown in Table 8\n• Acidity, shown in Table 9\nThe maximum or the highest value of the scores is used.\nWhile the oil is of good quality it does not provide a great\ndeal of information about the health of the transformer\nunlike DP or DGA, however, when the oil is poor it has a\nknock on effect on all the other parameters. Additionally,\ntransformer oil is can be replaced, or conditioned, unlike\nthe other parameters so it important that any issue is\nidentiﬁed. For this score a non-linear scale is used for the\nVol.109 (3) September 2018SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n166\nassessment. The scores are set between 0 and 30 with a\ntotal weighting of the PHI of 0.1. If the oil is of good\nquality it will not affect the PHI as it will carry a weight\nof 0. However the highest score is set at 30 to ensure that\neven with a weighting of 0.1 that it would be categorised\nas an unhealthy transformer and in need of immediate\nintervention.\nTable 7: Scoring of Moisture in Oil Assessment\nMoisture in Oil Score\nMoisture ≤ 10 ppm 0\n10 ppm < Moisture ≤ 20 ppm 2\n20 ppm < Moisture ≤ 30 ppm 4\n30 ppm < Moisture ≤ 40 ppm 10\nMoisture > 40 ppm 30\nTable 8: Scoring of Dielectric Field Strength assessment\nDielectric Strength Score\nV >60 kV 0\n60 kV > V ≥ 50 kV 5\n50 kV > V ≥ 40 kV 12\nV < 40 kV 30\nTable 9: Scoring of Acidity Assessment\nAcidity Score\nAcidity< 0.1 mg KOH/g 0\n0.1 mg KOH/g ≤ Acidity < 0.25 mg KOH/g 5\n0.25 mg KOH/g ≤ Acidity < 0.4 mg KOH/g 12\nAcidity > 0.4 mg KOH/g 30\n4.5 PHI Score\nThe PHI score is the sum of the weighted DP score, DGA\nscore, moisture score and oil quality score to categorise\nthe transformer as shown in Table 10. There are 14,000\npossible PHI scores between 0 and 7.4. The DP, DGA and\nmoisture score have low sensitivity to an input error. An\nerror would give a maximum score of 0.9 which would\npush it into a higher category, transformers scored in a\nhigher category would require maintenance or intervention\nand further oil samples would conﬁrm the error. The oil\nscore, however, has a high sensitivity, an error of 3 for\npoor oil quality would push it into the unhealthy category.\nTransformer oil can be replaced or conditioned, thus it\nrequires immediate intervention if it is poor. Further oil\nsamples would conﬁrm the error.\n4.6 Transformer Risk Index\nThe PHI is taken further to account for the network\ncharacteristics by using a network index (NI) and ancillary\nTable 10: PHI Categories\nCategory Descriptions Score\nA Healthy score < 1.01\nB Moderately healthy 1.01 ≤ score < 2.01\nC Moderately unhealthy 2.01 ≤ score < 3.01\nD Unhealthy 3.01 ≤ score\nequipment index (AI). The two indices are combined with\nthe PHI to give a risk index (RI). Table 11 lists the levels\nof the RI, effectively the transformer would only be placed\nin a higher risk category.\nTable 11: Risk Index Categories\nCategory Descriptions Score\nA Low risk score < 1.01\nB Low to medium risk 1.01 ≤ score <2.01\nC Medium risk 2.01 ≤ score <3.01\nD High risk 3.01 ≤ score\nIt is important to account for the network characteristics as\nthe Cigre study [19] highlighted the impact of the external\nshort circuit as a major cause of failure. The network\ncharacteristics uses a network index (NI) which includes:\n• A fault level score, shown in Table 12, is used to\nquantify the fault level of the network where the\ntransformers is installed. The higher the the fault\nlevel the more likely the transformer will experience\ndamage to the windings in the event of a fault. This is\na system design issue and would be allocated when a\ntransformer is installed.\n• Network performance score, shown in Table 13,\nwhere a score is assigned according to the occurrence\nof faults on the particular network. Circuit breaker\noperations, which would include load shedding and\nfaults on the network, dips on the network, reference\nto the location. This is currently difﬁcult to quantify,\nit is an operational and maintenance issue and could\nbe linked this to the SAIFI of the network.\nTable 12: Fault Level Score\nCategory Descriptions Score\nLow ≤3000 A 0\n3000 A < Medium ≤ 5000A 1\n5000 A < High 2\nThese scores each carry a weighting ratio of 0.3 to give a\nscore of 0-2.4 and are in the form illustrated in Figure 1.\nA network with a low fault level and where there is a low\noccurrence of faults on the network would have a value of\nVol.109 (3) September 2018 SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n167\nTable 13: Network Performance Score\nCategory Descriptions Score\nGood 0\nModerate 2\nPoor 4\nVery Poor 6\n0 and therefore not inﬂuence the RI. A perfectly healthy\ntransformer installed on a very poor network with a low\nfault level would be pushed to category C and a very poor\nnetwork with a high fault level would be categorised into\nD.\nThe ancillary equipment index (AI), shown in Table 14,\nuses a score assigned to known problematic bushings and\ntap changers (i.e. bushings over the age of 20 years,\nand/or modiﬁed tap changers). The ancillary equipment is\na known ﬁre hazard and a failure of either the tap changer\nor bushing would lead to a failure of the transformer even\nif the transformer is in a healthy state. The score would be\napplied to any transformer and removed when the bushing\nand tapchanger is assessed.\nTable 14: Ancillary Equipment Score\nCategory Descriptions Score\nGood 0\nPoor 1\n5. CASE STUDY\n5.1 Comparison of Health Indices\nTable 15 provides information obtained from an oil sample\nfor three transformers T1,T2 and T2.\nTable 15: Transformer Data\nParameter T1 T2 T3\nAge 12 37 12\nH2 (ppm) 0 37 9\nCH4 (ppm) 11 28 277\nC2H6 (ppm) 2 3 2259\nC2H4 (ppm) 12 59 36\nC2H2 (ppm) 9 115 0\nCO (ppm) 152 84 208\nCO2 (ppm) 2260 626 2571\nBreakdown (kV) 15 65 72\nAcid number 0.04 0.02 0.01\nWater in oil (ppm) 215 10 7\nDP 910 910 1300\nWater in paper (ppm) 4 2.78 1.18\nTable 16 compares the health indices from Naderian et al\n[3], Taengko et al [9], a simple PHI [13] (using 60% dp\nscore, 30% TDCG score and 10% moisture in paper score)\nand the PHI in this paper. The HIs proposed by Naderian\net al and Taengko et al have more elements than those used\nin this comparison as such were not use as those authors\nintended. This does however demonstrate that a HI needs\nto be developed based on the available information.\nTable 16: Comparison of Health Indices\nT1 T2 T3\nNaderian 88% 64% 64%\nTaengko 2 (Risk) 2.67 (Warning) 2.33 (Risk)\nSimple PHI 1.3 (B) 1.2 (B) 1.9 (B)\nPHI 5.55 (D) 3.11 (D) 1.92 (B)\nTransformer T1: The simple PHI indicated that the\ntransformer was in a moderately healthy state, however this\ndid not take into account the oil quality. The oil quality in\nthis case is so poor that the transformer was in an unhealthy\ncondition as indicated by the score of 5.55 in the PHI.\nThe Naderian HI indicated a healthy transformer, while\nthe Taengko HI indicated an unhealthy transformer. The\nweightings of the oil quality were not sufﬁcient to indicate\na problem.\nTransformer T2: The simple PHI indicated that the\ntransformer was in a moderately healthy state, the focus\non TDCG for this HI does not take into account the high\nlevels of C2H2, which indicated discharges occurring in the\ntransformer. The PHI indicated that the transformer was in\nan unhealthy conduction with a score of 3.11. The use of\na per gas indicator (LTPHI) and the BGR contributed to\nbetter categorising the score. Naderian and Taengko also\nuse a per gas indicator while the Naderian and Taengko HIs\ndemonstrated that the transformer was moderately healthy.\nTransformer T3: The simple PHI indicated that the\ntransformer was in a moderately healthy state, as does the\nPHI. There is high levels of TDCG, C2H6 and the BGR\nindicated a low temperature thermal fault. The transformer\nitself is in moderately healthy condition, the oil quality\nis good and the paper is try and has a high DP. Any\nfurther increase in C\n2H6 would push the transformer into\ncategory C. The Naderian and Taengko HIs also indicated\na moderately healthy transformer.\n5.2 Failed Transformers\nThe sample was from the Gauteng region where there were\n986 transformers listed at the time of the study, there were\n226 transformers with an invalid oil sample, these were\nexcluded, there were 337 transformers without a date of\nmanufacture, these were included where they could be as\nthe health index relies on DP instead of age. The failed\ndata was over a period of 3 years from 2014-2016. There\nVol.109 (3) September 2018SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n168\nwere 40 failed transformers, with valid oil sample data only\navailable for 27 of them.\nFigure 2 illustrates the PHI of the transformers against\nage (excluding the samples without an age.) The healthy\ntransformers are shown with a black asterisk and the\nfailed transformers are illustrated with a blue dot. It is\nevident that there is minimal correlation between the PHI\nof the transformer and age. It is evident that the failures\noccurred for any age. Failures predominantly occurred\nfor transformers categorised as unhealthy, although some\nfailures occurred for healthy transformers necessitating the\nneed for the additional indices accounting for network\nissues and ancillary equipment.\nFigure 2: PHI against age for the Gauteng region\nFigure 3 illustrates the PHI and RI of the 27 failed\ntransformers with available pre-failure data.\nTransformers 4, 7, 15, 24 and 25 each had a high DP score\nindicating they were reaching their end of life and were\ncategorised in C or D. Transformer 4 also had a high DGA\nscore. It was correctly categorised in D. Replacements for\nthese 6 transformers could been planned for.\nTransformers 8, 9, and 14 all had a high DGA score\nwith low DP and oil quality scores. These failures were\npredictable from the PHI. The DGA from transformers\n8 and 9 had a TDCG of 2198 ppm and 5427 ppm\nrespectively while the BGR showed D2 for both. The\nDGA from transformer 14 had a TDCG 3627 ppm while\nthe BGR showed T3. The high score for the BGR ensured\nthat the DGA score was high and the transformers were\ncategorised as unhealthy. The source of the issue for these\n3 transformers could have been identiﬁed and repaired or\nreplaced prior to fault.\nTransformers 11, 13 and 19 have poor oil quality score\nwith low DP and DGA score and are correctly categorised\nas unhealthy. Transformer 11 and 13 both have a high\nmoisture content, this is linked to the poor oil quality\nscore. These failures were predictable from the PHI.\nThe high score for the poor oil quality score is justiﬁed\nas these 3 transformers would have been identiﬁed for\nimmediate intervention as the oil could have been replaced\nor conditioned prior to failure.\nTransformers 7, 8, 20, 22, 24 and 27 were installed in\nnetworks where there multiple failures and known regular\nfaults. The ages of the transformers ranged from 0 to 42\nyears old. It can be seen that the PHI puts transformers 7,\n20, 22 and 27 into category B, while the inclusion of the\nnetwork performance score of 6 shifts these to the correct\nrisk categories of C and D. Transformers 8 and 24 were\nin PHI category D and C respectively, the inclusion of\nNI ensures the transformers are in risk category D. These\ntransformers would have to be monitored more closely\nto ascertain the damage that is caused by the network\nperformance.\nThe transformers with oil impregnated paper bushings\nwere given an ancillary equipment score of 1 for any\ntransformer over the age of 20 years.\nFor example transformers 1, 3, 6, and 10 are healthy\ntransformers in category B of the PHI, with the inclusion\nof the ancillary equipment score the these transformers\nmoved into category C of the RI. Transformers 15 and\n25 shifted from PHI category C to RI category D. The\nfailure for Transformer 16 was identiﬁed as a tapchanger\nproblem, it can be seen from the PHI that the transformer\nwas in a healthy state. The AI is important as it\nprioritises inspection, maintenance and/or replacement of\nancillary equipment. If upon inspection the condition of\nthe ancillary equipment was found to be good or upon\nreplacement, the AI would be reset to 0.\nFigure 3: PHI and RI for failed transformers\nFigure 4 illustrates the total number of operational\ntransformers in each category (in red) with the number of\nfailures overlaid (in blue) for the PHI respectively. It is\nevident that the majority of transformers are in category B\nand the highest number of failures occur here when only\nthe PHI considered.\nFigure 5 illustrates the percentage failure according to the\nVol.109 (3) September 2018 SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS\n169\nFigure 4: Comparison of failed to operational transformers in\neach PHI Category\ncategory for the PHI, PHI+NI and RI respectively. The\nPHI indicates that the highest percentage failures occur\nin category B and category D. The failed transformers\nin category B would not be prioritised in an asset\nmanagement plan as the PHI does not account for other\nfactors that may lead to failure; it is clear that the addition\nof the network performance score and the ancillary\nequipment score pushes the failed transformers into the\nhigher risk category. A number of the failures of these 27\ntransformers may have been prevented due to a prioritised\nasset management plan according to the PHI and RI.\nFigure 5: Percentage Failure according to PHI category\n6. CONCLUSION\nThe PHI was developed from available oil sample data\nincluding DP, moisture in paper, DGA and oil quality.\nThe PHI was weighted so that the it could identify both\nmedium term failure and end of life failure criteria. A\nRI was further developed which accounted the number of\nfaults that could occur and the magnitude of those faults\nas well as the ancillary equipment. The inclusion of the\nNI and AI assists in identifying which transformers are\nat risk of failure and on which transformers inspection,\nmaintenance, repair and/or replacement should take place.\nThe case studies on the individual transformers demon-\nstrated how the PHI was formulated to account for the\ndifferent available parameters. The case study on the failed\ntransformers demonstrated that the PHI and RI would\nhave identiﬁed transformers in need of intervention before\nfailure. The PHI and RI are shown to be important tools\nfor asset management in a utility.\n7.
