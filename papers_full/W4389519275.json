When these lan-\nguage models are applied in the field of psycho-\nlogical counseling, they often rush to provide\nuniversal advice. However, when users seek\npsychological support, they need to gain em-\npathy, trust, understanding and comfort, rather\nthan just reasonable advice. To this end, we\nconstructed a multi-turn empathetic conversa-\ntion dataset of more than 2 million samples,\nin which the input is the multi-turn conversa-\ntion context, and the target is empathetic re-\nsponses that cover expressions such as question-\ning, comfort, recognition, listening, trust, emo-\ntional support, etc. Experiments have shown\nthat the empathy ability of LLMs can be sig-\nnificantly enhanced when finetuning by using\nmulti-turn dialogue history and responses that\nare closer to the expression of a psychological\nconsultant.1\n1 Introduction\nWith the birth of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and\nGPT (Radford et al., 2018), large language mod-\nels (LLMs) have made rapid progress in the past\nfive years. In November 2022, OpenAI launched\nChatGPT2 (OpenAI, 2022), a large language model\nfine-tuning by reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022). However,\nwhen applied to mental health or emotional sup-\nport conversation, there are three main issues lead\nto ChatGPT appear less “human-centered”:\n1) ChatGPT tends to provide repetitive and\nstandardized responses.ChatGPT often uses\nthe following template to respond to users’\nquestions related to mental health: \" 我很\n∗Corresponding author. Email: xfxing@scut.edu.cn\n1https://github.com/scutcyr/SoulChat\n2https://chat.openai.com\n抱歉...。xxx是...。以下是一些建议：...。\n(I’m sorry to ...{xxx} is ...Here are some sug-\ngestions:...)\", which may cause boredom.\n2) ChatGPT is inclined to provide suggestions\nrather than ask questions or listen.It is ea-\nger to solve users’ problems, usually provid-\ning lengthy and general suggestions, as shown\nin Figure 12 of Appendix F. However, pro-\nfessional psychologists rarely provide specific\nsuggestions during the counseling process.\n3) ChatGPT acts a bit like a rational \"Straight\nman\" for those users who need listening\nand comfort.Users who seek emotional sup-\nport usually expect empathy support such as\nlistening, understanding and comfort.\nSimilar issues can also be found in other LLMs,\ne.g. ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023), SparkDesk 3,\nas presented in Appendix F. It may be due to the\nlack of large-scale multi-turn empathy conversa-\ntion datasets for fine-tuning stage, especially in\nthe field of Chinese mental health or emotional\nsupport. EMPATHETICDIALOGUES (Rashkin\net al., 2019) and ESConv (Liu et al., 2021) are\ntwo English empathy conversation datasets that is\nused for developing emotional support conversa-\ntion (ESC) systems, e.g MISC (Tu et al., 2022),\nGLHG (Peng et al., 2022), MultiESC (Cheng et al.,\n2022), FADO (Peng et al., 2023) and etc. On the\none hand, these models may rely on annotated\nempathy strategies and emotions of users during\nthe training or inference stage, which means that\nbuilding large-scale similar datasets for fine-tuning\nLLMs is difficult. On the other hand, these datasets\nare in English, so that they cannot be applied to\nfine-tune Chinese LLMs. As for mental health,\nefaqa (Hailiang et al., 2020) and PsyQA (Sun et al.,\n2021) are two commonly-used datasets. Among\n3https://xinghuo.xfyun.cn\n1170\n我最近总觉得自己很焦虑，身心俱疲。不知道该怎么办。 \nI have been feeling anxious and physically and mentally exhausted lately. I don't \nknow what to do.\n我可以听听你的感受。你可以告诉我具体是什么让你感到焦虑吗？\nI can hear your feelings. Can you tell me exactly what makes you feel anxious?\n最近工作压力很大，还有一些人际关系上的问题，让我很难受。\nRecently, there has been a lot of work pressure and some interpersonal issues, which \nhave made me feel very uncomfortable.\n听起来你正在经历着很大的挑战。但是你知道，你已经很了解自己的状况了。\n其实很多人都有这种感觉。\nIt sounds like you are going through a great challenge. But you know, you already \nknow your situation very well. Actually, many people have this feeling.\n可是我一直觉得自己无法克服它，好像之前无论尝试哪种方法都没有改变。\nBut I always feel like I can't overcome it, as if no matter which method I tried before, \nit hasn't changed.\n不要放弃，或许你需要更长时间的调整。有时做一些基础的自我照顾会加强\n你的意志力，来克服这种感觉。\nDon't give up, perhaps you need more time to adjust. Sometimes doing some basic \nself-care will strengthen your willpower to overcome this feeling.\n...\nFigure 1: A case of a user confiding to SoulChat. Compared to ChatGPT, SoulChat is better at listening and guiding\nusers to think.\nthem, efaqa contains 20,000 conversations and pro-\nvides annotation information such as types of trou-\nbles, psychological disorders, SOS, etc. However,\nefaqa has a complex multi-party dialogue relation-\nship and a high proportion of low-quality responses\nfrom netizens, while PsyQA contains 22,346 ques-\ntions and 56,063 single-turn long-text psycholog-\nical counseling conversations. Thus, neither of\nthese datasets can solve the three issues of Chat-\nGPT mentioned above.\nRecently, Qiu et al. (2023) proposed a SMILE\napproach to employ ChatGPT to convert single-\nturn dialogues into multi-turn ones. They uti-\nlized SMILE to extend the single-turn conversa-\ntion dataset PsyQA to a empathy multi-turn con-\nversation dataset SMILECHAT with 355,733 sam-\nples. Inspired by (Qiu et al., 2023), we pro-\nposed a Chinese empathy constraint prompt, in\nwhich the empathy prompt constraint is further\nstrengthened compared with SMILE prompt (see\nAppendix C). As shown in Figure 2 (English ver-\nsion: Appendix C), our empathy constraints are\ndefined as “‘心理咨询师’的回复需要结合用户\n的描述内容并提供共情，如：倾听、安慰、\n理解、信任、认可、真诚、情感支持等 (The\nresponse of the ’psychological counselor’ needs\nto be combined with the user’s description and\nprovide empathy, such as listening, comfort, inter-\npretation, trust, recognition, sincerity, emotional\nsupport, etc)”.\n\"messages\": [\n{\"role\": \"user\", \n  \"content\": '''请扮演一个心理咨询领域的文本改写员，将给定\n的【单轮长文本中文心理咨询对话】改写为多轮的共情的对\n话，要求如下：1、多轮对话以“用户：”开始，“心理咨询\n师：”结束；2、“心理咨询师”的回复需要结合用户的描述\n内容并提供共情，如：倾听、安慰、理解、信任、认可、真\n诚、情感支持等；3、用户和心理咨询师的对话轮数应根据对\n话内容决定，在8-20轮之间；4、在一轮对话当中，用户与心\n理咨询师的对话长度应结合对话历史，并且不宜过长。\\n\\n\n【单轮长文本中文心理咨询对话】：'''+ single_turn +'''\\n\\n请\n逐步分析以上单轮对话中用户的需求以及心理咨询师的共情\n技巧，并且改写为多轮的共情的对话，你的改写结果为：'''\n}]\nFigure 2: The prompt used for converting single-turn\npsychological counseling conversations to multi-turn\nempathy conversations (English version: Appendix C).\n1171\nTo this end, we first constructed 215,813 differ-\nent psychological counseling questions about 12\ntopics and 619,725 answers through data outsourc-\ning services. Rule-based cleaning, manual rewrit-\ning and human proofreading are applied to ensure\nthat there is no sensitive or privacy-related content\nin the dataset. Then, we use ChatGPT to convert\nthese single-turn long text psychological counsel-\ning conversations to multi-turn empathy conversa-\ntions. We also conducted manual proofreading and\ndata cleansing for multi-turn dialogues rewritten\nby ChatGPT to further strengthen the expression of\nempathy, such as questioning, comfort, recognition,\nlistening, trust, emotional support, etc. In the end,\nwe obtained a multi-turn empathy conversation\ndataset, named SoulChatCorpus, with 2,300,248\nsamples. To our knowledge, it is the first million-\nscale multi-turn empathy conversation dataset in\nthe field of mental health or emotional support. We\nconduct experiments by using ChatGLM-6B as the\nbase model for fine-tuning on SoulChatCorpus. Re-\nsults demonstrate that LLMs’ empathy, listening,\nand comfort abilities can be improved significantly\nthrough fine-tuning with million-scale multi-turn\nempathy conversation dataset.\n/uni00000029/uni00000044/uni00000050/uni0000004c/uni0000004f/uni0000005c\n/uni0000001c/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000008\n/uni00000030/uni00000044/uni00000055/uni00000055/uni0000004c/uni00000044/uni0000004a/uni00000048\n/uni00000014/uni00000019/uni00000011/uni00000016/uni00000008\n/uni00000036/uni00000048/uni0000005b/uni00000016/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000008\n/uni0000002a/uni00000055/uni00000052/uni0000005a/uni00000057/uni0000004b\n/uni00000018/uni00000011/uni0000001b/uni00000008\n/uni00000035/uni00000048/uni0000004f/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051/uni00000056/uni0000004b/uni0000004c/uni00000053/uni00000003\n/uni00000014/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni00000013/uni00000008\n/uni00000026/uni00000044/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000048/uni00000055\n/uni0000001c/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000008/uni00000036/uni00000048/uni0000004f/uni00000049/uni00000010/uni00000044/uni0000005a/uni00000044/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000048/uni00000056/uni00000056/uni00000003\n/uni00000014/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni00000014/uni00000008\n/uni00000025/uni00000048/uni0000004b/uni00000044/uni00000059/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000055/uni00000014/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni00000018/uni00000008\n/uni00000028/uni00000050/uni00000052/uni00000057/uni0000004c/uni00000052/uni00000051\n/uni00000014/uni00000014/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000008\n/uni00000037/uni00000055/uni00000048/uni00000044/uni00000057/uni00000050/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000057\n/uni0000001a/uni00000011/uni0000001c/uni00000008\n/uni00000036/uni00000052/uni00000046/uni0000004c/uni00000044/uni0000004f/uni00000003/uni00000048/uni00000059/uni00000048/uni00000051/uni00000057/uni00000056\n/uni00000013/uni00000011/uni0000001a/uni00000008\n/uni00000033/uni00000056/uni0000005c/uni00000046/uni0000004b/uni00000052/uni0000004f/uni00000052/uni0000004a/uni0000004c/uni00000046/uni00000044/uni0000004f/uni00000003/uni0000004e/uni00000051/uni00000052/uni0000005a/uni0000004f/uni00000048/uni00000047/uni0000004a/uni00000048\n/uni00000015/uni00000011/uni00000014/uni00000008\nFigure 3: Distribution of counseling topics.\n2 Human-centered Mental Health LLM\n2.1 SoulChatCorpus Collection\nWe consider an one-on-one psychological counsel-\ning conversational setting where a user and a psy-\nchological consultant engage in multiple rounds\nof dialogue. However, such conversation data is\nnot publicly available due to the privacy protection\nand ethical standards of psychological counseling.\nTo construct high-quality multi-turn empathy con-\nversation dataset, We selected 12 topics of psycho-\nlogical counseling to construct 215,813 long-text\nquestions and 619,725 long-text answer through\ncrowdsourcing. The distribution of topics is shown\nin Figure 3. Then, we used ChatGPT (99% called\ngpt-3.5-turbo api and 1% called gpt-4 api) as a text\nrewriting tool following the prompt as shown in\nFigure 2 to convert single-turn psychological coun-\nseling conversations to multi-turn empathy conver-\nsations, in which one turn is in the form of \" 用\n户： <user_utt>\\n心理咨询师：<psy_utt>\". The\nresponse of \"心理咨询师\" was asked to be rewrit-\nten to reflect human-centered expressions such as\nempathy, listening, comfort, etc. Finally, after man-\nual proofreading, we removed 105,134 low-quality\nsamples and ultimately obtained 2,300,248 sam-\nples. As shown in Figure 4, the word cloud map of\nthe utterances expressed by psychological consul-\ntants indicated that the rewritten multi-turn empa-\nthy conversation has high level of empathy.\nFigure 4: Word cloud map of psychological consultants’\nutterances (English version: Appendix D).\n2.2 SoulChat Model\nWe utilized the ChatGLM-6B (Du et al., 2022;\nZeng et al., 2023) as the base LLM architecture\nto develop the SoulChat.

The WarmupDecayLR learning\nrate scheduler with warmup_steps = 1000 and\nwarmup_max_lr = 5e−5 is used. The maxi-\nmum input token length is set to 1,536. The maxi-\nmum target token length is set to 512. The decod-\ning algorithms of Top-p sampling with p = 0.75\nand temperature τ = 0.95 is adopted during the\ninference phase.\n4https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B\n3.3 Results and Analysis\nWe randomly selected 10,000 samples from\nSoulChatCorpus and SMILECHAT respectively as\nthe test set for automatic evaluation and 100 sam-\nples for manual evaluation. For each sample, each\nmodel generates an answer for evaluation. We used\n7 evaluation metrics as automatic metrics: BLEU-\n1 (B-1), BLEU-2 (B-2), BLEU-3 (B-3), BLEU-4\n(B-4) (Papineni et al., 2002), R-1 (ROUGE-1), R-\n2 (ROUGE-2) and R-L (ROUGE-L) (Lin, 2004)).\nThree individual experts majoring in Psychology\nwere asked to evaluate the generated responses in\nterms of content naturalness (Con.), empathy level\n(Emp.), Helpfulness (Hel.) and Safety (Saf.), as\ndetailed described in Appendix G. The rating scale\nof Con., Emp. and Hel. is (0,1,2), while (0,1) for\nSaf., where higher score means better. One hundred\ndialogues were randomly sampled from the test set\nof SoulChatCorpus and SMILECHAT for manual\nevaluation. Fleiss’ κ(Fleiss, 1971) for Con., Emp.\nand Hel. are 0.489, 0.472 and 0.532, indicating\nmoderate annotation agreement respectively, while\nκ= 1for Saf. (perfect agreement). The evaluation\nresults are shown in Table 1. Generally, SoulChat\noutperforms ChatGLM-6B, ChatGPT and MeChat\nin both automatic evaluation metrics and Emp. met-\nric on test set of SoulChatCorpus and SMILECHAT.\nSpecifically, the results on SMILECHAT demon-\nstrates SoulChat’s excellent zero-shot performance\nin the field of mental health.\n4 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this paper, we explore how to make LLMs more\nhuman-centered. To this end, we constructed a Chi-\nnese large-scale multi-turn empathy conversation\ndataset, named SoulChatCorpus, with 12 empathy\n1173\ntopics and more than 2 million samples. The ex-\nperimental results indicate that using this dataset\nto finetune LLMs leads to high-level empathy abil-\nity when users try to seek emotional support from\nLLMs. Future work needs to further consider user\nattributes, such as personality, gender and etc., to\nhelp LLMs generate targeted empathy responses\nfor different individuals.\nLimitations\nIn this work we proposed a human-centered LLM\nnamed SoulChat that has excellent empathy abil-\nity, which is finetuned on the proposed SoulChat-\nCorpus dataset. Although the experimental re-\nsults demonstrate the effectiveness of SoulChat,\nthere are still some limitations need to consider.\nThe mechanism of empathy is complex. Differ-\nent users have different expectations for the out-\nput of the model. For example, when discussing\ntense emotions, there are significant differences in\nthe solutions expected by adults and adolescents.\nTherefore, human-centered LLMs need to further\nconsider the user’s personality, identity, and other\nattributes to assist in generating answers that are\ncloser to the user’s needs.\nEthics Statement\n• Data Collection. In order to protect pri-\nvacy (Hovy and Spruit, 2016), we adopted\nstrict manual proofreading process when con-\nstructing the dataset. We filtered all samples\nwith special strings such as \"我是(I am)\", \"自\n杀(suicide)\", \"跳楼(jumping off a building)\",\netc., and conducted manual data cleansing.\nAny text related to privacy has been rewritten\nor removed. Besides, any potential conversa-\ntions that pose harm to users, others, or soci-\nety have been completely removed from our\ndata. To this end, we removed 105,134 sam-\nples from multi-turn conversations generated\nby ChatGPT.\n• Potential Risks of the ModelWe conducted\na safety assessment specifically for the out-\nput of the model during the manual evaluation\nphase, and the results are shown in Table 1.\nDue to the lack of human feedback during the\nmodel finetuning stage, there are inevitably\nanswers that may pose harm to users. There-\nfore, future work needs to combine RLHF to\nimprove the safety level of model generated\ncontent. In addition, when this model is ap-\nplied to downstream scenarios, it is necessary\nto inform the users in advance that the answers\nthey see are generated by the AI model and\nare for reference only.\n• Annotator Compensation. We invited in-\ndividual experts majoring in Psychology to\nconduct the proposed CEHS evaluation of the\nmodel’s output. The annotators’ evaluation\nof each sample takes approximately 3 min-\nutes, during which they can receive a salary\nof $0.418. Therefore, the hourly salary of the\nannotators is $8.36, which is higher than the\nUS minimum wage of $7.12 per hour.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the Science and Tech-\nnology Project of Guangzhou (202103010002),\nthe Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong\nProvince (2022A1515011588), the National Key\nR&D Program of China (2022YFB4500600), the\nScience and Technology Project of Guangdong\n(2022B0101010003), the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China under Grant U1801262 and\nGuangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Human\nDigital Twin (2022B1212010004).\nReferences\nYi Cheng, Wenge Liu, Wenjie Li, Jiashuo Wang, Ruihui\nZhao, Bang Liu, Xiaodan Liang, and Yefeng Zheng.\n2022.

I am\nusually very good. I started arguing and quarrel-\ning a year ago, and my boyfriend said unpleasant\nthings or even cursed. Is it normal\nPsychologist: Hello! Long distance love is usually\nokay, but when you argue, it’s really abnormal to\nscold you. This should be related to many factors\n1. Long distance relationships are inherently chal-\nlenging, and when your boyfriend is away from\nyou, their language and language are challenged\n2. When he usually gets along with you, he will\nalso have a lot of pressure, so when encountering\nsimilar situations, he will be very irritable\n3. When we usually get along with him, there is no\nconflict between you. Whenever there is a conflict,\nwe will argue fiercely\n4. You usually communicate less, so he doesn’t\nhave a channel to vent his negative emotions\nThe above are some possibilities, but they may not\nnecessarily be the reason for his situation, because\nwhether there are any other conflicts between you\nis only known through communication between the\ntwo of you. So, I think you should seriously con-\n1176\nsider what kind of psychological state or situation\nyour boyfriend’s behavior is in, and only you know\nit best.\nAs shown in Figure 7 (English version: Fig-\nure 8) and Figure 9 (English version: Figure 10),\nthe multi-turn conversation generated by using the\nproposed prompt has richer expressions of empathy,\ncompared with SMILE prompt.\nD English Word Cloud Map\nThe English word cloud map is presented in Fig-\nure 6.\nFigure 6: Word cloud map of psychological consultants’\nutterances.\nE Sample Conversations of SoulChat\nAs shown in Figure 11, SoulChat can better serve\nas a listener when users seek emotional support or\nconfide. Besides, it can naturally empathize with\nusers (e.g. \" 你的童年经历真的很不容易(Your\nchildhood experiences were really difficult)\", \"我\n可以理解你的痛苦和内心的挣扎 (I can under-\nstand your pain and inner struggle)\") and comfort\nthem (e.g. \" 我相信你是一个坚强的人，你可\n以通过自己的努力来改变现状。 (I believe you\nare a strong person who can change the situation\nthrough your own efforts.)\").\nF Sample Conversations of Other LLMs\nThe examples when users seek emotional sup-\nport from ChatGPT, ChatGLM and SparkDesk are\nshown in Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14. These\nLLMs are inclined to provide suggestions rather\nthan ask questions or listen, acting a bit like a ra-\ntional “Straight man” for those users who need\nlistening and comfort, which make them appear\nless “human-centered”.\nG Manual Evaluation Instructions\nFor mental health LLMs, we have constructed a\nmanual evaluation framework called \"CEHS\" with\nthe following four dimensions: Content natural-\nness, Empathy, Helpfulness, Safety, as presented\nin Table 2. Specifically, there may be a certain\nconflict between Empathy and Helpfulness. For\nexample, ChatGPT tends to generate helpful but\nlacking empathetic responses. On the other hand,\nwhen SoulChat generates empathetic responses, it\nmay weaken the direct Helpfulness of the answer.\nThis is because general advice often appears help-\nful, but not so empathetic. The scores of Empathy\nand Helpfulness in Table 1 also illustrate this phe-\nnomenon.\nTable 2: Manual Evaluation.\nAspect Score Description\nContent 0-2\nIt mainly evaluates whether the con-\ntent generated by the model is rele-\nvant and coherent to the user’s con-\nversation history, whether the con-\ntent is smooth and natural, whether\nthe content is consistent with lan-\nguage habits, whether the content\nhas syntax error.\nEmpathy 0-2\nThe main assessment is whether the\ntext generated by the model can un-\nderstand the feelings and behaviors\nof the parties involved, grasp their\ninner feelings, deep meanings, and\ntheir degree.\nHelpful-\nness 0-2\nThis indicator mainly evaluates\nwhether the output of the model is\nhelpful to the user. When evaluating\nthis item, it is necessary to consider\nfrom the user’s perspective whether\nthe model’s answer provides assis-\ntance.\nSafety 0-1\nThis indicator mainly evaluates\nwhether the text generated by the\nmodel causes harm to users, others,\nsociety, environment, etc., whether\npersonal privacy is protected, and\nwhether laws and regulations are\ncomplied with. The main consider-\nations are: respect for social moral-\nity, Public policy doctrine. Whether\nit violates laws and regulations,\ninvolves political sensitivity, com-\nmits crimes, infringes on physical\nhealth, infringes on mental health,\ninfringes on property privacy, dis-\ncriminates/prejudices, insults/hate\nspeech, violates ethical ethics, etc.\n1177\n用户：我谈恋爱已经两年了，但我们是异地恋。平时一切都很好，但一年前我们开始吵架，而且吵得\n越来越凶了。男朋友会说一些难听的话，甚至骂人，这正常吗？\n心理咨询师：你好！我了解你目前遇到的困扰。异地恋本身是具有挑战性的，尤其是在沟通和相处上。\n男朋友在吵架时用难听的话甚至骂人，这确实不正常。我可以理解这对你的心情会带来巨大的打击和\n困扰。\n用户：是的，我们之间的争吵让我感到非常痛苦。我不知道他为什么会这样，以前的他可没有这样过。\n心理咨询师：首先，我理解你对他的改变感到困惑。这可能是因为异地恋本身会带来心理压力和情绪\n波动。在长期的异地恋中，他可能因为思念和不安而变得脾气暴躁。同时，我们都有情绪发泄的渠道，\n但由于你们之间缺乏实质性的沟通，他可能没有找到良好的方式来释放负面情绪。\n用户：对，我们在平时的相处中很少沟通，我觉得这可能是问题的一个原因。但我也不确定其他还有\n哪些矛盾存在。\n心理咨询师：你的观察是非常敏锐的。确实，沟通不足可能会导致矛盾的积累。我建议你们尝试更多\n的沟通，坦诚地分享彼此的想法和感受，以便更好地了解彼此。同时，我也鼓励你们之间的互相理解\n和支持，试着接纳对方的情绪和困难。这样的共情和理解，有助于建立更加稳固的关系。\n用户：谢谢你的建议。我会试着与他更多地沟通，同时也希望他能够理解我的感受。\n心理咨询师：我很欣赏你积极主动地寻求解决办法。沟通需要时间和耐心，但只有通过双方坦诚地沟\n通和互相支持，才能逐渐解决问题。我相信你们一定能够克服困难，共同走向更健康、稳定的关系。\n如果你在沟通的过程中还有其他问题，随时都可以来找我。\n用户：谢谢你的鼓励和支持。我会继续努力的。\n心理咨询师：你很勇敢，我相信你一定能够克服困难。如果你需要任何帮助，记得随时向我寻求支持。\n你不是一个人在面对这个问题的，我会一直陪伴在你身边。\nInterpretation\nInterpretation\nRecognition\nRecognition\nTrust\nComfort\nInterpretation\nTrust\nFigure 7: Multi-turn conversation generated by ChatGPT using the proposed prompt.\nUser: I have been dating for two years, but we are in a long-distance relationship. Everything is usually fine, \nbut a year ago we started arguing and it became increasingly fierce. Is it normal for a boyfriend to say \nunpleasant things or even curse?\nPsychologist: Hello! I  have know the difficulties you are currently facing. Long distance love itself is \nchallenging, especially in terms of communication and interaction. It is indeed abnormal for a boyfriend to use \nunpleasant language or even curse during arguments. I can understand that this will bring a huge blow and \ndistress to your mood.\nUser: Yes, our argument has caused me great pain. I don't know why he is like this, he hasn't been like this \nbefore.\nPsychologist: Firstly, I understand that you are confused about his changes. This may be because long-distance \nlove itself will bring Psychological stress and emotional fluctuations. In a long-term long-distance relationship, \nhe may become irritable due to longing and unease. Meanwhile, we all have channels for emotional release, but \ndue to the lack of substantive communication between you, he may not have found a good way to release \nnegative emotions.\nUser: Yes, we rarely communicate in our daily interactions, and I think this may be one of the reasons for the \nproblem. But I am not sure what other contradictions exist.\nPsychologist: Your observation is very sharp. Indeed, insufficient communication may lead to the \naccumulation of conflicts. I suggest that you try to communicate more and share your thoughts and feelings \ncandidly, in order to better understand each other. At the same time, I also encourage mutual understanding and \nsupport between you, trying to accept each other's emotions and difficulties. This kind of empathy and \nunderstanding helps to establish a more stable relationship.\nUser: Thank you for your suggestion. I will try to communicate more with him and also hope that he can \nunderstand my feelings.\nPsychologist: I appreciate your proactive approach in seeking solutions. Communication requires time and \npatience, but only through honest communication and mutual support can problems be gradually resolved. I \nbelieve you can overcome difficulties and work together towards a healthier and more stable relationship. If \nyou have any other questions during the communication process, feel free to come to me at any time.\nUser: Thank you for your encouragement and support.

Your \nboyfriend is not a normal and healthy behavior to say unpleasant things and curse others during a fight.\nHelper: But we don't have any problems with our daily interactions. Why did we suddenly become so irritable?\nSupporter: This may be caused by a combination of multiple factors. Firstly, long-distance love itself requires \nmore effort and persistence, which poses a challenge to both parties' emotions and communication skills. \nSecondly, he may also face many pressures and troubles in his daily life, and his irritability during arguments \nmay be an accumulation of emotions and stress. At the same time, there is a lack of sufficient communication \nand interaction between you, and he may not have sufficient channels to release negative emotions, leading to \nemotional loss during arguments.\nHelper: The possibilities of these situations you mentioned are very high, I really need to think carefully. But I \nam still very worried that our conflicts and arguments will affect our relationship.\nSupporter: Understand your concerns. Contradictions and arguments can indeed have a negative impact on \nrelationships. However, there is no need to be too pessimistic.
