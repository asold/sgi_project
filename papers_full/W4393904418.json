Research, including findings from the American College\nHealth Association (ACHA)–National College Health Assessment,\nhighlights a concerning prevalence of anxiety, depression, and re-\nlated issues among students [4, 7, 33, 35]. Students face a range of\npressures, from academic challenges to social and personal hurdles,\nwhich affect not only their mental health but also their emotional re-\nsilience and personal growth [22, 44–46]. While traditional mental\nhealth interventions administered by clinicians do provide person-\nalized and context-specific support, emerging technologies present\nan opportunity to extend this support, making it more readily avail-\nable, automated, and able to potentially overcome considerable\narXiv:2404.00487v1  [cs.HC]  30 Mar 2024\nCHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Nepal et al.\ninstitutional barriers. In addition, there is a need for innovative\nsolutions that align with the digital habits of today’s students. We\npropose a novel study, MindScape, that integrates the traditional\npractice of journal writing with mobile technology and large lan-\nguage models (LLM) [34] to create a contextually-aware journaling\napplication. The MindScape Android application benefits from on-\ndevice sensors and data to provide insights into the user’s daily\nlife. It tracks aspects such as physical activity, social interactions,\nand location to form an understanding of the context in which\nthe individual operates. By analyzing these data in real-time, the\napp can provide personalized, context-sensitive journaling prompts\ndesigned to provoke thought and reflection. The prompts aim to\nremind users to introspect and commit time to digitally record their\nthoughts, thus establishing regular self-reflection habits that are\ncontextualized by their daily lives. MindScape represents a novel\napplication class that incorporates behavioral intelligence into AI.\nWe believe that integrating time-series data obtained from mobile\nphones and wearables, capturing real-time behaviors and patterns\nof users, with the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwill give rise to a new category of AI applications driven by mobile\nsensing.\nJournaling has long been recognized as a potent tool for self-\nreflection, enabling individuals to externalize thoughts, consolidate\ndisjointed experiences, and identify patterns in their behavior and\nemotional states. This practice of regular introspection has been\nlinked to a range of psychological benefits, from reducing distress\nsymptoms to enhancing overall wellbeing [ 17, 43]. In this study,\nwe explore the potential gains realized through the inclusion of\npersonalization and context-awareness in journaling. The inclu-\nsion of personalization and context-awareness in journaling is not\nmerely an innovation for convenience’s sake. Instead, it addresses\ncertain inherent limitations in human introspection and memory\nrecall abilities. People may not readily identify certain behavioral\npatterns or come to particular conclusions about their daily lives\nwithout some form of guidance or external input. This is where\npersonalized and context-aware prompts can be valuable, as they\nmay highlight aspects of users’ lives they may have overlooked.\nAdditionally, human memory recall can be biased towards more\nrecent experiences, sometimes at the expense of equally signifi-\ncant past events. Context-aware journaling can help counteract\nthis limitation by bringing forward relevant circumstances, events,\nor feelings from different timeframes in the users’ life. Lastly, by\naddressing these user limitations, personalized and context-aware\njournaling could not just improve the process of journaling, but\nalso potentially enhance the mental health benefits associated with\nthis practice.\nHerein lies the novelty of our approach: using mobile sensing\nto capture behavioral data that reflects the user’s context and emo-\ntional state, and employing an LLM to generate journaling prompts\nthat are highly relevant to the user’s current contextual situation\nand surroundings. In addition to the context-aware journaling\nprompts, our study app also triggers context-aware check-ins (such\nas, “Your morning seemed to include more than just tapping screens – a\nbit of chitchat too!” ) that are delivered four times daily to encourage\nquick moments of reflection as opposed to longer-form journaling.\nThe daily check-ins are short and simple texts relevant to what the\nuser is experiencing at the time they are issued. Users can answer\nthese contextual check-ins with a simple thumbs up or thumbs\ndown button – they are designed for fast, low burden response.\nThis relevance of check-ins can increase the user’s engagement\nand attachment with the journaling app, and similarly, the context-\naware nature of the journaling prompt can make their entries more\nmeaningful, potentially amplifying the mental health benefits they\nreceive from journaling. Furthermore, the MindScape journaling\napp integrates additional contextual factors such as students’ mood\nwhile journaling, their academic stress levels, and temporal vari-\nables like weekdays or weekends. Early in our development, we\nconducted a qualitative user study with undergraduate students to\nunderstand their journaling habits and preferences. Insights from\nthis study, revealing students’ desires for personalized, context-\naware prompts aimed at fostering reflection on daily experiences,\nsignificantly influenced the app’s design. We believe our holistic\napproach allows for a more tailored and responsive tool, capable of\nproviding meaningful support in the unique, often high-pressure,\nfast paced environment of college life [31]. Some of our research\nquestions are as follows:\n•RQ1: How does integrating mobile sensing and AI-driven jour-\nnaling affect college students’ mental well-being and personal\ngrowth?\n•RQ2: How do context-aware journaling prompts, informed\nby mobile sensing data, contribute to enhancing the depth,\ndetail, and insightfulness (key measures of quality) of students’\nreflective journaling practices?\n•RQ3: Is the integration of mobile sensing and AI-driven jour-\nnaling a feasible and acceptable approach for college students,\nand how do they perceive its impact on self-awareness and\nemotional regulation?\n•RQ4: How do college students perceive the overall function-\nality and experience of the MindScape app? This includes\nevaluating what aspects are most effective and identifying\nareas for improvement in the context of a technology-driven,\npersonalized journaling experience.\nThe MindScape study is designed to enhance the classic bene-\nfits of journaling by utilizing the latest advancements in LLMs to\nprovide an unobtrusive, effective tool for users to manage their\nwellbeing and growth. This approach is closely aligned with the\nHuman-Computer Interaction (HCI) community’s interests, high-\nlighting the significance of AI in enriching user-centric digital\nexperiences. Bridging into Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp), our\nresearch focuses on integrating these technologies into everyday\nroutines. Our goal is for this tool to offer benefits and support and\nassist students in developing lasting self-reflection and emotional\nmindfulness skills. We hope that this study will contribute signifi-\ncantly to the ongoing dialogue in HCI and UbiComp, particularly\nregarding the seamless integration of technology to enhance per-\nsonal well-being, offering a comprehensive view of its practical\napplication and user impact.\n2 RELATED WORK\nJournaling is a reflective practice where individuals record their\nthoughts, feelings, and experiences. The act of journaling promotes\nself-awareness [1, 47], processing of emotions [42], and cognitive\norganization of experiences [43]. Studies have consistently shown\nContextual AI Journaling CHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nthat journaling can improve mood, provide stress relief, and overall,\nenhance mental well-being [ 24, 32, 43]. As mobile devices and\ncomputers become more prevalent, they have reshaped the practice\nof journaling. The transition to digital journaling platforms brings\nconveniences that traditional paper-based methods lack. These\ninclude enhanced accessibility, ensuring that users can journal\nanytime and anywhere, heightened privacy—as entries are secured\nbehind digital safeguards—and the ability to enrich journal entries\nwith multimedia elements.\nJournaling can be prompted or unprompted. Unprompted jour-\nnaling allows for free expression without specific guidelines, giving\nusers freedom to explore their thoughts and feelings. In contrast,\nprompted journaling uses specific questions or suggestions to guide\nthe journaling process, providing a structure that can help focus\nand inspire the user. Such prompts are designed to encourage self-\nreflection, personal growth, and exploration of various topics and\nexperiences. Several digital journaling platforms offer a wide range\nof prompts to initiate the writing and reflection journey, providing\ndaily reminders to ensure users stay on track with their journaling.\nThis approach can be particularly helpful for users who are new to\njournaling or those looking to explore new areas of self-discovery\nand creativity. However, most prompted journaling applications\nrely on generic prompts not tailored to the user’s situation. Several\nstudies demonstrate that question prompts are one of the main\nfactors positively affecting reflection quality [12, 13, 19, 20]. Thus,\ngeneric prompts, while useful, may reduce reflection quality due to\ntheir broad nature [3, 39].\nOur study focuses on context-aware journaling, where journal-\ning prompts are derived from behavioral data collected via smart-\nphones. This approach enhances traditional journaling by offering\nprompts that closely align with users’ daily experiences and mental\nstates. By using mobile sensing technology, capable of tracking ac-\ntivities, sociability, locations, and app usage, we generate dynamic\nprompts that reflect the nuanced aspects of an individual’s life.\nThis approach differs from previous studies that have explored a\nbroader range of personal informatics systems for reflection [9, 15],\nby integrating these insights into the journaling process. For ex-\nample, Kocielnik et al. [28] leverage mobile based step count for\nreflection on activity level whereas Bakker and Rickard [6] use\nthe MoodPrism app to help in mood tracking. Our method aims\nto mirror the reflective goals of various fitness and sleep apps and\nto offer deeper insights into users’ lifestyles and emotional pat-\nterns through personalized journaling. In addition, our study uses\na wide range of contextual cues to facilitate journaling, a feature\nthat sets it apart even from its closest counterparts like Apple’s\njournal application [2]. While Apple’s offering leverages contex-\ntual data such as photos and location to generate prompts, it is\npositioned within the iOS system and does not fully tap into the\nexhaustive range of cues that our study incorporates on Android\ndevices. For example, our approach extends beyond conventional\ncontext-awareness to include an amplified set of signals like digi-\ntal habits, which includes screen time, social, entertainment, and\ncommunication app usage. Our methodology also captures levels\nof social interaction, including in-person conversations, calls, and\ntext message exchanges.\nFurther, our study integrates both sleep information, such as\nduration and timing, as well as physical fitness metrics like ac-\ntivity levels, distance travelled, and time spent at the gym. Our\nstudy also considers location-based semantics like time spent in\na cafeteria, Greek spaces, and other similar locations. This com-\nprehensive approach sets our study apart by providing a more\nnuanced and detailed context for generating personalized jour-\nnaling prompts. Our study also leverages LLM capabilities to en-\nable the creation of intelligent, personalized journaling prompt.\nAI-driven tools have been used in therapy chatbots, virtual agents,\nand behavior change systems, offering personalized advice and\nsupport [10, 14, 23, 25, 29, 30, 36, 41, 48–50]. These applications\ndemonstrate the capacity of AI to understand and respond to a\nwide range of emotional and psychological states. Existing studies\nhave leveraged LLMs for AI-mediated journaling [18, 26, 27]. How-\never, to our knowledge, none of the existing studies have integrated\nobjective and passively observed behavioral data into AI-mediated\njournaling. By using an LLM framework to analyze behavioral data\nand generate relevant journaling prompts, we aim to investigate the\npotential for a nuanced, data-driven augmentation of the journaling\nprocess. Our study seeks to reinforce the benefits of journaling,\nwhile simultaneously exploring the effectiveness of context-aware\nprompts for highly reflective self-expression. Through this unique\napproach, we aim to optimize the impact of personalized digital\njournaling.\n3 METHODOLOGY\n3.1 Study Design\nWe plan to enroll approximately 40 participants. This number is\ntailored to balance a sufficient sample size while accounting for\ntechnological constraints, particularly as the MindScape passive\nsensing app is only compatible with Android devices. We plan to tar-\nget participants who already practice journaling, aiming to assess\nthe added value of MindScape’s contextual prompts for those experi-\nenced in reflective writing. We anticipate that journaling individuals\nmay more readily engage with the app’s features. Participants will\nbe compensated, with a potential compensation of up to USD 130.\nThe study includes initial onboarding surveys, weekly surveys (also\nknown as Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA)), and conclud-\ning surveys over 8 weeks. Our study excludes participants with high\ndepression, identified by elevated PHQ-8 survey scores, to ensure\nsafety, since the prompts are not manually screened for sensitive\ncontent. We additionally interviewed five students at Dartmouth\nCollege to gain insights into their preferences for a journaling appli-\ncation, grounding our approach in user-centered design principles.\nThe study is approved by Dartmouth’s Internal Review Board.\n3.2 Mobile Sensing based Behavioral Data\nThe MindScape app automatically infers user activities, like move-\nment and rest, analyzes conversation lengths, and gathers data\non screen usage and location (see Table 1). This provides an in-\ntegrated view of a user’s daily patterns, social interactions, and\ndigital habits. For example, the sensing data might reveal patterns\nin how often participants attend social functions, dine at campus\nfacilities, or go to the gym. This information allows us to tailor\nCHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Nepal et al.\nTable 1: Behavioral Data Categories: Users are required to prioritize among the four behavioral data categories, each encom-\npassing specific feature sets.\nCategory Signals/Features Example Journaling Prompt Generated\nPhysical Fitness\nPhysical activity (walking, running, and sedentary duration) Your running routine has really taken off! How’s that\nDistance travelled influencing your day?\nTime spent at the Gym\nSleep Sleep duration Your sleep pattern has shifted recently. Could this change\nSleep schedule (start time and end time) be affecting your daytime energy and focus?\nDigital Habits Screen time You’ve been clocking less screen time lately. What have you\nApp use (Freq. of social media, communication, & entertainment apps use)been doing instead that you’ve found rewarding or enjoyable?\nSocial Interaction\nPhone logs (incoming calls, outgoing calls, incoming SMS, outgoing SMS)\nIn-person conversations (number and duration of conversations) Your call patterns are up; any conversations lately that\nNumber of significant places visited brought a smile to your face?\nTime spent at frats/sororities partying\nMisc. locations (Time spent at leisure, social, study places, cafeteria & home)\nthe journaling prompts to align with the participant’s current ex-\nperiences and to support their emotional well-being. As part of\ngathering this data, we created a semantic map of the college cam-\npus, with locations such as dining areas and gyms marked, allowing\nthe app to accurately infer the context of participants’ activities.\nThis allows for prompts to be customized, encouraging reflection\non particular events of the day. The integration of the GPT-4 LLM\nenables the translation of this rich, multi-faceted behavioral data\ninto personalized and contextually relevant journaling prompts\nand frequent check-ins that enhance positive introspection and\nparticipant engagement. All data collected are temporarily stored\non the participant’s phone and then securely uploaded to the Mind-\nScape cloud. We then leverage the GPT-4 model through OpenAI’s\nAPI [38], allowing us to process the collected behavioral data and\nadditional contexts to generate tailored prompts. Addressing po-\ntential concerns relating to participant privacy, we ensure all data\nsent for processing via OpenAI’s GPT-4 model are de-identified\nand consist only of high-level metadata. This approach includes\nstripping any potentially personally identifiable information before\nthe data is utilized to generate tailored prompts. We acknowledge\nthat a locally hosted open-source model could offer an alternative to\nmitigate privacy concerns further, albeit with possible performance\ntradeoffs. In this study, our focus has been oriented towards under-\nstanding the potential and efficacy of this novel application of AI\nin journaling practices. Given this emphasis, we decided to utilize\nOpenAI’s GPT-4 model for its robust performance and scalability\ncapabilities.\n3.3 Personalized Journaling Prompts\nUpon installing MindScape app, participants will allow the app\npermission for data collection. Then, they will rank their journaling\ninterests in four key areas — Social Interaction, Sleep, Digital Habits,\nand Physical Fitness. We identified these four key areas through\ninterviews with students on campus (See Section 4). Because we col-\nlect many different types of data, we want to ensure the journaling\nprompts we provide are actually helpful to participants. Thus, we\nuse these categories to identify what matters most to each individ-\nual participant. We also include the user’s preferences (i.e., category\nranking) in the prompt for GPT-4 [37] to generate more relevant\njournaling prompts. During their enrollment, each user enters their\nusual bedtime for both weekdays and weekends. Journaling notifica-\ntions are triggered two hours before their reported bedtime. When\na notification is tapped, participants are redirected to the app’s\njournaling screen. There, they are first asked how their day was,\nfollowed with a one-minute breathing exercise, and finally, they\nare asked to write or record (i.e., audio) their journal entry. Only\nat this point can the participants see the personalized journaling\nprompt. Participants can also open the app and journal whenever\nthey prefer. Note, the one-minute deep breathing exercise before\njournaling is based on findings that short relaxation techniques\ncan improve mental clarity and emotional readiness [8, 51]. This\nstep aims to help users transition to a reflective mood, enhancing\ntheir focus for more insightful journaling. It’s intended to make\nthe journaling process a calming, enriching routine. Figure 1 shows\ndifferent screens of the application.\nContexts The GPT-4 prompt composition process incorporates\nseveral layers of contextual data:\n•Personal Priorities: The user’s preferences across the four\njournaling categories ensure that the journaling prompts\nmirror individual interests.\n•Prompt Variability: The system ensures that new prompts\nare different from the previous two, generating diverse and\nengaging content.\n•Temporal Data Analysis: Behavioral data from weekdays\nare contrasted with a 30-day historical average to establish\ncontext. On Saturdays, the app encourages users to reflect on\ngeneral themes from the preceding week, rather than daily\nbehaviors (for example, “Recall a recent academic success.\nHow did you achieve it and what did it teach you about your\nresilience or strategy?\" ). Sundays are used for a comprehen-\nsive review including additional data points - such as Greek\nhouse attendance and sleep quality - to capture weekend\npatterns pertinent to college life. Note: In the U.S., ‘Greek\nhouses’ are fraternity or sorority residences, where social and\norganizational activities are hosted.\n•Academic Calendar Awareness: As the academic term\nstructure influences stress, the current week of the term\nis considered during prompt generation, intending to offer\nsupportive content during high-stress phases.\nContextual AI Journaling CHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nFigure 1: MindScape App Workflow: Users sign in, set preferences in four categories, and start journaling with a notification\ntap. Journaling workflow includes an emoji based mood assessment, a one-minute breathing exercise, followed by contextual\nprompts. The final screen showcases the daily context-aware check-in.\n•Mood Consideration: If a participant reports a low mood,\nGPT-4 is prompted to offer journaling prompts that evoke\nself-compassion or gratitude—strategically fostering a nur-\nturing journaling environment. By guiding users towards\nreflecting on aspects they are grateful for or encouraging\nkindness towards themselves, the hope is that these prompts\ncan shift focus from negative thoughts to more positive, af-\nfirming ones. It is a strategic, evidence-based approach aimed\nat offering immediate emotional relief while contributing\nto long-term emotional well-being, resilience, and mental\nhealth [16].\nOur methodology emphasizes customization, employing both user\npreferences and behavioral signals to empower participants in their\nreflective journaling practice. In Figure 2, we show how all these\ncome together to form the input to the GPT-4 LLM.\n3.4 Context-aware Check-ins\nThe check-ins are “micro context-aware nudges” based on users’\ndata, and are answered with a quick thumbs up or thumbs down\nresponse. For example, “Caught up with some calls and social apps\nthis morning - digital world kept you busy, I bet!\" . The MindScape\napp offers such check-ins four times a day at 12.30 PM, 3.30 PM,\n6.30 PM and 11 PM. These times are strategically selected to suit the\ndaily rhythms of college students, ensuring the interaction remains\nbrief and unobtrusive.\nCHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Nepal et al.\nFigure 2: Prompt Template for Weekday Journaling: The input prompt to GPT-4 is composed of four parts: 1) System prompt 2)\nUser context 3) Rules to optimize the prompt and 4) The strategy to generate the journaling prompt.\nEach check-in is designed to incorporate the behavioral data\ngathered during the time period extending from the previous check-\nin up to the current one. For instance, the 3:30 PM check-in uses\ndata collected from 12:00 PM to 3:30 PM, while the 6:30 PM check-in\nuses data gathered from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM. This approach ensures\nthat each check-in is responsive to the most recent behavioral data\ncaptured for the participant. The goal of these check-ins is to both\nincrease the visibility of the app (as opposed to users seeing it\njust once a day for journaling) as well as to increase reflection on\nbehavior through a casual, quick touchpoints.\n4 RESULTS\n4.1 Phase 1: User Study\nWe conducted qualitative user studies comprising in-depth inter-\nviews with five undergraduate students at Dartmouth College, with\nthe aim of understanding their journaling habits, preferences, and\nreactions to personalized prompts potentially generated by the\nMindScape app. The students were aged between 18-24, consisting\nof three males and two females. These participants were sought\nthrough invitations extended by the team, targeting individuals\nwho could provide important insights into the efficacy and impact\nof personalized journaling prompts within the context of university\nlife. From these interviews, we obtained several key insights:\n•Journaling Preferences: Students indicated a preference\nfor using journaling as a means to tackle personal challenges\nor to meet specific objectives, such as improving gym rou-\ntines. They favored insightful prompts and identified four\nmain areas of interest: Social Interaction, Sleep, Physical\nFitness, and Digital Habits.\n•Self-reports and Sensing-based Prompts: Students were\nwilling to provide self-reports at different times of day, sug-\ngesting that multiple daily check-ins and end-of-day jour-\nnaling are feasible. They responded positively to location-\nspecific prompts, such as those related to meals in the cafe-\nteria or academic work in the library.\n•Mood based prompts: The interviews highlighted a pref-\nerence for contextually timed journaling prompts. For in-\nstance, during stressful periods like exams, students pre-\nferred prompts that focus on positive aspects and are easy\nto engage with.\n•Academic Stress: The study confirmed our understanding\nof the academic stress patterns among students.\nThese insights have shaped the development of MindScape’s\nprompting mechanisms to support users in engaging with their\nreflective practices in a meaningful way. For instance, we inte-\ngrated additional contexts into the app such as academic calendar\nawareness, mood consideration, weekday vs weekend prompts, and\npersonal priorities.\nContextual AI Journaling CHI EA ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\n4.2 Phase 2: Expected Results from Larger-Scale\nStudy\nWe are currently recruiting participants for the larger-scale study\ndescribed above. To evaluate the impact of the MindScape app\non student well-being and personal growth, we will use a com-\nbination of standardized surveys, participant feedback, and app\ninsights. We anticipate positive changes in mindfulness, emotion\nregulation, mental well-being, personal growth, resilience, life satis-\nfaction, social connections, self-reflection, and personal insight. For\neach of these areas, specific surveys have been chosen to measure\nchanges effectively. For instance, the Five Facet Mindfulness Ques-\ntionnaire [5] will assess changes in mindfulness, while the Emotion\nRegulation Questionnaire [21] will gauge emotion regulation. Simi-\nlarly, surveys like Ryff’s Scales of Psychological Well-being [40] and\nthe Flourishing Scale [11] will help evaluate overall mental wellness.\nIn this proof-of-concept phase, any level of change observed, or\neven its absence, will offer insights into user interactions with our\napp and its usability, crucial for HCI considerations. This initial\nstudy, focusing on students from a single campus with previous\njournaling experience and no mental health disorders, is as much\nabout understanding user engagement as it is about quantifying\noutcomes. We are mindful that changes observed in this specific\ndemographic may be less pronounced than in other groups, such\nas those with mental health disorders.\nOur goal, therefore, is also to evaluate the effectiveness and user\nreception of the MindScape app, leveraging feedback on its function-\nality and the impact of its unique contextual prompts for guiding\nfuture enhancements. Our exit surveys will probe into aspects like\napp performance and users’ experiences with contextual versus\ntraditional generic prompts. To address our research objectives, we\nplan to undertake a multi-faceted analysis:\n(1) By conducting a comparative review of wellbeing and per-\nsonal growth survey responses collected before and at the\nend of the study, we aim to identify any positive shifts.\n(2) We will solicit direct feedback on the app through questions\nregarding users’ observations of changes, overall satisfaction,\nstandard usability metrics, among other things.\n(3) Additionally, we intend to apply Natural Language Process-\ning (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of journal en-\ntries, offering insights into user engagement and the reflec-\ntive outcomes of journaling.\nThis research lays the foundation for developing an automated\nsystem for creating personalized prompts, which could significantly\nbenefit a more diverse and more responsive audience, including\nthose facing mental health challenges. By validating our method\nin a controlled environment, we are setting the stage to expand\nour study to wider populations, exploring the broader impact of\njournaling in technology-enhanced mental health interventions.\n5 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nOur study prioritizes high ethical standards to safeguard partici-\npant rights and well-being. Participants will give informed consent\nbefore starting the study, with the option to withdraw at any time.\nData privacy is ensured through anonymization using individual\nIDs, secure storage, and restricted access to data. We advise partici-\npants to omit personal identifiers in journal entries and clarify that\ndata is not monitored live, with emergency services information\nprovided. The journaling screen displays a reminder about this. We\nwill implement best practices for data security, allow participants to\nreport prompt-related issues, and ensure GPT-4 generated prompts\nare free from sensitive content using a keyword filter. Participants\nwill also be free to skip any journal entries as they choose. In addi-\ntion, the data being passed on to GPT-4 is de-identified and contains\nhigh-level metadata only.\n6 CONCLUSION\nThis study takes important strides in merging mobile technology\nwith mental health practices by introducing a context-aware jour-\nnaling application that extends the benefits of traditional reflec-\ntion. Utilizing behavioral data collected via smartphones, and ap-\nplying an LLM for prompt generation, we have crafted a system\nthat provides personalized prompts on Android devices—a level\nof customization that goes beyond current applications. As this\nresearch unfolds, its findings may offer new directions for individ-\nualized mental health interventions and showcase the potential\nof technology-assisted self-help tools that can be integrated seam-\nlessly into daily life, particularly for those in stressful academic\nenvironments and beyond.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Dorit Alt and Nirit Raichel. 2020.
