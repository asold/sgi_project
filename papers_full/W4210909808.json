  "abstract": "Checking the stable supply voltage of a power distribution transformer in operation is an important issue to prevent mechanical failure. The acoustic signal of the transformer contains sufficient information to analyze the transformer conditions. However, since transformers are often exposed to a variety of noise environments, acoustic signal-based methods should be designed to be robust against these various noises to provide high accuracy. In this study, we propose a method to classify the over-, normal-, and under-voltage levels supplied to the transformer using the acoustic signal of the transformer operating in various noise environments. The acoustic signal of the transformer was converted into a Mel Spectrogram (MS), and used to classify the voltage levels. The classification model was designed based on the U-Net encoder layers to extract and express the important features from the acoustic signal. The proposed approach was used for its robustness against both the known and unknown noise by using the noise rejection method with U-Net and the ensemble model with three datasets. In the experimental environments, the testbeds were constructed using an oil-immersed power distribution transformer with a capacity of 150 kVA. Based on the experimental results, we confirm that the proposed method can improve the classification accuracy of the voltage levels from 72 to 88 and to 94% (baseline to noise rejection and to noise rejection + ensemble), respectively, in various noisy environments.",
