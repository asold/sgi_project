Premotor and\nposterior parietal areas in the monkey brain contain bimodal\n(visuo-tactile and auditory-tactile) or trimodal (visuo-audio-\ntactile) neurons with a tactile receptive ﬁeld centered on a\nspeciﬁc body part (head, face neck, trunk or shoulders) and\nav i s u a l(Rizzolatti et al., 1981; Graziano et al., 1994, 1997;\nDuhamel et al., 1998) and/or an auditory (Graziano et al., 1999;\nSchlack et al., 2005) receptive ﬁeld overlapping the tactile RF and\nextending to the space around it for a limited distance (usually\nabout 30 cm).\nAnalogous forms of multisensory responses speciﬁcally for\nthe space around the body have been repeatedly shown also in\nhumans and in brain areas homologous to those where PPS neu-\nrons have been shown in monkeys (Bremmer et al., 2001; Makin\net al., 2007; Gentile et al., 2011; Serino et al., 2011; Brozzoli et al.,\n2012).\nOur group has recently developed a new audio-tactile inter-\naction task to measure the extension of PPS representation\n(Canzoneri et al., 2012, 2013a,b; T eneggi et al., 2013). Brieﬂy, par-\nticipants performed a speeded tactile detection task on a body\npart while concurrent task-irrelevant sounds approached toward,\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 4| 1\nBEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE\nSerino et al. Plasticity in peripersonal space representation\nor receded from, the stimulated body part. We found that sounds\nspeeded up the tactile reaction time (RT) only when they were\nadministered within a limited distance from the hand, i.e., within\nthe boundaries of PPS representation (see also Serino et al.,\n2007, 2011). Using dynamic sounds, we were able to calculate the\ncritical distance where sounds affected tactile RT along a contin-\nuum between near and far space, thus estimating the boundaries\nof PPS.\nA critical property of PPS representation is that it is dynami-\ncally modiﬁed through experience. Using a tool to reach objects\nin the far space extends the boundaries of PPS representation.\nIn monkeys,Iriki et al. (1996)showed that hand-centered visual\nRFs of neurons located in the intraparietal sulcus extended after\na training period of using a rake to retrieve pieces of food\nplaced at a distance. In humans, neuropsychological (Farnè and\nLàdavas, 2000; Maravita et al., 2001) and psychophysical (Holmes\net al., 2004; Maravita and Iriki, 2004; Serino et al., 2007)s t u d -\nies demonstrated that, after using a tool, crossmodal interactions\nbetween tactile stimuli at the hand and visual or auditory stim-\nuli in the far space—i.e., at the location where the tool has\nbeen used—increase, suggesting extension of PPS representation.\nTaken together, these ﬁndings suggest that the extent of PPS\nrepresentation is dynamically shaped depending on experience,\nextending the action possibilities of the body over its structural\nlimits (seeMaravita and Iriki, 2004; Gallese and Sinigaglia, 2010;\nCostantini et al., 2011). Although the aforementioned conclusion\nis widely accepted (but seeHolmes et al., 2007; Holmes, 2012), the\nmechanism underlying PPS plasticity after tool-use is currently\nunknown.\nWe have recently developed a computational neural network\nmodel describing visual-tactile representation of PPS around the\nhand (Magosso et al., 2010a,b) .T h em o d e lw a sa b l et or e p r o -\nduce the characteristic behavior of PPS neurons, namely that\nthey respond to tactile stimuli and to visual stimuli presented\nn e a r ,b u tn o tf a r ,f r o mt h eb o d y .T h em o d e lw a sa l s oa b l et o\nreproduce the extension of PPS due to tool-use (Magosso et al.,\n2010b): after a simulated tool-use training, the model PPS neu-\nrons respond to stimuli presented in the far space. Interestingly,\nthe model also generates a testable prediction to explain how\nsuch plasticity in PPS representation may be generated. According\nto the model, PPS extension after tool-use does not depend on\nthe tool itself, but it is a consequence of pairing tactile stimula-\ntion at the hand location (via the tool handle) with synchronized\nvisual stimuli occurring in the far space (at the functional part\nof tool). Thus, it is possible to predict that simple presenting tac-\ntile near stimuli and synchronous visual (or auditory) far stimuli,\nindependently from any tool use, would be sufﬁcient to extend\nPPS representation. On the contrary, no PPS extension is pre-\ndicted in case of asynchronous tactile and visual (or auditory)\nstimulation.\nThe aim of the present study is to empirically test, in\nboth computational and behavioral experiments, the aforemen-\ntioned prediction generated by our computational model. In\norder to measure behaviorally the extension of PPS represen-\ntation, we used the audio-tactile paradigm we recently devel-\noped (Canzoneri et al., 2012; T eneggi et al., 2013). However, the\nPPS computational model originally described inMagosso et al.\n(2010a) focused on visuo-tactile interaction. Thus, in the ﬁrst part\nof the present study we also present a new audio-tactile version of\nthe PPS computational model, simulating audio-tactile, instead\nof visual-tactile, interaction in the space around the hand. Indeed,\na c c o u n t i n gf o rt h ec h a r a c t e r i s t i co ft h ea u d i t o r ys y s t e mi nt h e\nmodel is important to generate solid and reliable predictions to be\ntested behaviorally using the audio-tactile interaction paradigm.\nIn a ﬁrst simulation experiment (Section The Computational\nStudy), the model was then applied to simulate the effects on PPS\nrepresentation of an audio-tactile training that consists in admin-\nistering tactile stimuli on the hand together with synchronous\nauditory stimuli in the far space. This training would simulate the\nsensory inputs gathered in case of using a tool to interact with\nobjects in the far space. As a control condition, we also tested\nthe effects of an asynchronous audio-tactile training, in which\nauditory and tactile stimuli were not correlated in time. We pre-\ndict that the synchronous, but not the asynchronous training,\nwould extend PPS representation, that is it would make PPS neu-\nrons responding to far auditory stimuli at the end of the training,\ndifferently than before the training.\nIn an in vivo experiment (Section The Behavioral Study), we\nthen tested behaviorally the model’s prediction that a tactile and\nfar-auditory synchronous stimulation extends PPS representation\nin humans, even without any use of the tool. T o this aim, we\nassessed PPS representation in a group of volunteers before and\nafter an audio-tactile stimulation training. During the training,\nsubjects received a tactile stimulus at the hand while a concur-\nrent auditory stimulus was synchronously presented in the far\nspace (at 1 m from the hand). As a control condition, partici-\npants’ PPS representation was also measured before and after an\nasynchronous training consisting in tactile stimuli delivered at the\nhand and auditory far stimuli, with a randomized temporal delay\nbetween the two. T o measure the extension of PPS before and\nafter auditory-tactile stimulation, we took advantage from our\nnew audio-tactile interaction paradigm (Canzoneri et al., 2012;\nT eneggi et al., 2013), which allows estimating the critical dis-\ntance where sounds speeded up tactile reaction time as a proxy of\nPPS boundaries. That distance was compared before and after the\nsynchronous and asynchronous trainings. Following the model\nprediction, we hypothesized that after the synchronous, and not\nafter the asynchronous audio-tactile training, PPS boundaries\nwould extend toward the far space, as it happens following a\nclassic tool-use training (seeCanzoneri et al., 2013a).\nTHE COMPUTATIONAL STUDY\nNEURAL NETWORK DESCRIPTION\nHere, we brieﬂy introduce a neural network model represent-\ning audio-tactile interaction in PPS. This model is a modiﬁed\nversion of the model described inMagosso et al. (2010b) (see\nalso Magosso et al., 2010a) focusing on visual-tactile interaction\nin the space around the hand. Modiﬁcations were necessary to\nreplace the visual modality with the auditory modality, requir-\ning adjustment of nodes and connections parameters within the\nnetwork. In particular, an important point to be accounted for\nis the lower spatial resolution of the auditory system compared\nwith the visual one. In this section, qualitative model descrip-\ntion is presented. A quantitative description of the model with all\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 4| 2\nSerino et al. Plasticity in peripersonal space representation\nequations, parameter values and simulation details can be found\nin the Supplementary Material.\nBrieﬂy, the model includes two unisensory areas (tactile and\nauditory) communicating—via synaptic connections—with a\nthird multisensory (audio-tactile) area (Figure 1A).\nThe tactile unisensory area contains a matrix of neurons map-\nping a surface of 20 cm× 10 cm, approximately representing the\nsurface of the whole hand. The auditory unisensory area con-\nt a i n sam a t r i xo fn e u r o n sm a p p i n gas p a c eo f2 0 0c m× 30 cm on\nand around the hand, where stimuli potentially interacting with\nthe hand can occur. Each unisensory neuron has its own recep-\ntive ﬁeld (RF): in both areas, neuron RFs are in hand-centered\ncoordinates. Since the auditory system is characterized by a low\nspatial resolution, the auditory neurons have been assigned large\nRFs. Additionally, unisensory neurons within each area recipro-\ncally interact via lateral synapses arranged according to a Mexican\nhat disposition (near excitation, far inhibition). Each unisensory\narea may receive an external spatially localized (tactile or audi-\ntory) stimulus: the resulting activation in the area is determined\nby the neuron RFs joined with the action of lateral synapses. In\nparticular, due to the large auditory RFs, an auditory stimulus\ninduces a wide activation in the auditory area.\nThe two unisensory areas send feedforward excitatory synapses\nto the downstream multisensory area, which is devoted to the\nbimodal (audio-tactile) representation of the PPS around the\nhand. For sake of simplicity, only one multisensory neuron is\nconsidered (seeMagosso et al., 2010b). The feedforward synapses\nfrom the tactile neurons to the multisensory one have all the same\nvalue (i.e., independent from the location of the tactile neuron\nRF, see Figure 1B). On the contrary, the feedforward synapses\nfrom the auditory neurons decrease their value as a function of\nthe distance of the auditory RF from the hand (Figure 1B), so\nthat, auditory neurons having RFs on or near the hand send\nstronger synapses to the multisensory area than auditory neu-\nrons with RF placed far from the hand. The feedforward tactile\nand auditory synapses—combined with the RFs of the unisensory\nneurons—shape the tactile and auditory RF of the multisensory\nneuron.\nThe multisensory neuron, in turn, sends feedback excita-\ntory synapses to the unisensory upstream areas; the feedback\nFIGURE 1 | (A)Schematic diagram of the audio-tactile network. The network\nincludes a unisensory tactile area, a unisensory auditory area and a\nmultisensory area. Each ﬁlled circle represents a neuron.

The unisensory areas and the\nmultisensory area communicate via reciprocal synapses: W\nt,W a are\nfeedforward synapses from the unisensory tactile and auditory neurons,\nrespectively, to the multisensory neuron; Bt,B a are the feedback synapses\nfrom the multisensory neuron to the unisensory tactile and auditory neurons,\nrespectively.

Plasticity in peripersonal space representation\nsynapses have been given the same arrangement as the feedfor-\nward ones. Via the feedback synapses, activities in the unisensory\nareas may inﬂuence reciprocally, that is, in case of a multimodal\n(audio-tactile) stimulation, the stimulus in one modality (e.g., the\nauditory one) may affect activation in the other unisensory area\n(e.g., the tactile one).\nEach neuron responds to its input via a temporal dynamics\nbefore it settles to a ﬁnal activation value (maximum neuron\nactivation is 1). Hence, network response to a stimulus develops\ngradually in time until the new steady-state condition is reached.\nFigure 2exempliﬁes the behavior of our network in response\nto unimodal stimulation. A tactile stimulus on the hand\n(Figure 2A) and an auditory stimulus close to the hand\n(Figure 2B) activate the corresponding unisensory area as well as\nthe multisensory neuron. On the contrary, an auditory stimulus\nfrom the far space (Figure 2C) activates the unisensory neurons\nFIGURE 2 | Network behavior in basal conditions in response to\nunimodal stimulation.Plots refer to the ﬁnal steady-state condition.\n(A) Network response to a tactile stimulus.

The\nmultisensory neuron is activated.(C) Network response to an auditory\nstimulus far from the hand (at positionx = 100 cm,y = 5 cm, i.e., at a\ndistance of 80 cm from the hand). The multisensory neuron is silent. Worth\nnoticing that the external tactile and auditory stimuli have the same spatial\nextension: the larger activation in the auditory area is the consequence of the\nbigger auditory RFs.

Plasticity in peripersonal space representation\nbut not the multisensory one. Hence, the multisensory neuron in\nthe model mimics the responses of PPS neurons as observed in the\nposterior parietal areas of the primate brain (Graziano et al., 1999;\nSchlack et al., 2005), responding to tactile stimuli on the monkey’s\nbody and to auditory stimuli presented close to monkey, but not\nfar apart (SeeFigure 2).\nIn the last two decades, several models have been proposed to\nstudy multisensory integration. Most of these models are based\non a Bayesian approach, providing a set of probabilistic rules\nthat can predict perceptual phenomena of cue integration (Knill\nand Richards, 1996; Ernst and Banks, 2002; Alais and Burr, 2004;\nShams et al., 2005). These models, however, do not propose any\ninsight about the underlying neural mechanisms. Other models,\non the other hand, have attempted to tackle the neural pro-\ncesses involved in multisensory integration. In particular, Pouget\nand colleagues proposed an inﬂuential computational framework\nto formalize multisensory integration in the context of refer-\nence frames transformation (Pouget and Sejnowski, 1997; Deneve\net al., 1999;s e ePouget et al., 2002 for a review). Brieﬂy, their\nnetworks consist in multiple layers coding unisensory inputs in\ntheir original frames of reference, interconnected with different\nmultisensory layers. Multisensory integration occurs in multi-\nple modules within the parietal cortex, where stimuli are coded\nin intermingled reference frames. These modules project to a\nset of motor modules, that encode the locations of stimuli in\nframes of reference speciﬁc to the task controlled by each system.\nOur present model (as well as the previous ones we have pro-\nposed; seeMagosso et al., 2010a,b) shares some important aspects\nwith Pouget’s model, such as the multilayer architecture of the\nnetwork, the presence of recurrent (feedback and feedforward)\nconnections between the unisensory and multisensory areas, the\nimplementation of unisensory neurons with spatial tuning func-\ntions. On the other hand, our models include additional features\nwhich are crucial for investigating PPS representation, such as\ndependence of RF’s size on the speciﬁc sensory modality, patterns\nof feedforward and feedback synapses tuned on the speciﬁc sen-\nsory modality and the distinction between coding of stimuli near\nand far from a body part.\nNEURAL NETWORK TRAINING AND TESTING\nAudio-tactile training\nThe model was used to simulate incoming sensory inputs during\ntool-use training. At the sensory level, the use of a tool pro-\nduces tactile stimulation on the hand, transmitted by the tool\nhandle, paired with simultaneous visual and/or auditory infor-\nmation from the space where the tool is actively used (i.e., far\nspace). Hence, tool-use training was mimicked by applying a tac-\ntile stimulus and a synchronous auditory stimulus as inputs to\nthe network. Tactile stimulation was replicated as a localized tac-\ntile input on the hand able to activate both the tactile area and the\nmultisensory area (as inFigure 2A). The auditory stimulation was\nreplicated as an auditory input applied far from the hand at posi-\ntion x = 100 cm andy = 5c m( a si nFigure 2C). The two stimuli\nhad the same duration and were applied simultaneously. This net-\nwork stimulation replicates the sensory information input that\nwould occur during the use of a long tool (about 1 m long) to\nfunctionally interact with the far space position (x = 100 cm).\nThe lack of visual information (as in the present model) may\ncorrespond to the case of a subject performing the training in\nblindfolded conditions (see e.g.,Canzoneri et al., 2013a). During\nthe application of the stimuli, the feedforward synapses link-\ning the unisensory neurons with the multisensory one modiﬁed\naccording to a Hebbian-like rule. The rule includes a potentiation\nfactor—i.e., synaptic weight increases in the presence of tempo-\nrally correlated activities of the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic\nneurons, up to a maximum saturation value—and a forgetting\nfactor—i.e., the reinforced synapsis loses its weight in case of\nuncorrelated activities. The synchronous audio-tactile stimula-\ntion activates the tactile neurons and the multisensory one (due\nto projections from the tactile area) and produces the simultane-\nous activation of the auditory neurons with RF placed far from\nt h eh a n d( d u et ot h ef a ra u d i t o r ys t i m u l u s ) .A sar e s u l to ft h e\nHebbian mechanism, the synapses linking the auditory neurons\nhaving RFs in the far space with the multisensory neuron—which\nare originally weak (seeFigure 1B)—reinforces, due to the simul-\ntaneous activation of the pre-synaptic auditory neurons and the\npost-synaptic multisensory neuron.

Tactile feedforward synapses did not change, as they are set\nat their maximal value already in basal (pre-training) conditions.\nThe network training was replicated in case of an asyn-\nchronous audio-tactile stimulation (i.e., control condition).

This kind\nof stimulation replicates sensory information stream that may\noccur in activities not involving the use of a tool, whereby tac-\ntile stimulus (due to object manipulation with hands) may be\nonly partially and randomly correlated with far auditory stim-\nuli. In this conditions, the potentiation factor in the Hebbian\nlearning rule is counterbalanced by the forgetting factor: at the\nend of the training (30 presentations of the asynchronous stim-\nulation), auditory feedforward synapses exhibited only negligible\nmodiﬁcations compared to pre-training conditions.\nTesting the effects of audio-tactile training on PPS representation\nIn a series of simulations, we evaluated the effect of the training\non PPS representation in the model. T o this aim, we ﬁrst assessed\nhow the training affected the response of the multisensory neuron\nto an unimodal auditory stimulus placed at different positions in\nspace, i.e., at different distances from the hand. The intensity of\nthe auditory stimulus was randomly varied to generate variability\nin network response. For each position, the stimulus was applied\n30 times to the untrained network and to the trained network; for\neach simulation, the ﬁnal activation of the multisensory neuron\nwas computed.

In that paradigm, tactile\nRT on a body part is evaluated while a sound is simultaneously\npresented at different distances from the body part: the criti-\ncal distance where the sounds speed up tactile RT is considered\nas a proxy of PPS boundaries. T o replicate this experiment, the\nnetwork—both before training and after training—was fed with\na tactile stimulus on the hand (able by itself to activate the mul-\ntisensory neuron, as inFigure 2A) and a simultaneous auditory\nstimulus applied at different distances from the hand. For each\nof the 15 tested sound distances (between 140 and 0 cm from the\nhand), the stimuli were applied 30 times to the untrained network\nand to the trained network. For each simulation, we computed\nthe time necessary for the tactile area to reach 90% of its ﬁnal\nactivation as a measure representative of tactile RT in the net-\nwork. The inﬂuence the auditory stimulation may exert on the\ntactile response (measured in terms of reaction time) is medi-\nated by the multisensory area via the feedback synapses. When the\nauditory stimulus is not able to trigger the multisensory neuron,\nunimodal tactile response is unaffected by auditory stimulation,\nWhen the auditory stimulus is able to trigger the multisensory\nneuron, it contributes to speed up tactile unimodal activation.\nTherefore, tactile RT for sounds at different distances depends on\nthe extension of the auditory RF of the multisensory area.\nRESULTS\nResponses of the multisensory neuron to unimodal auditory\nstimuli are reported inFigure 4A.B e f o r et h et r a i n i n g ,t h em u l t i -\nsensory neuron responded to auditory stimuli located at a limited\ndistance from the hand (within 50–60 cm from the hand). After\ntraining in the synchronous condition, the multisensory neu-\nron responded also to stimuli presented farther apart (up to\n≈90 cm), showing that the synchronous audio-tactile training has\nproduced an extension of PPS representation. This ensues from\nmodiﬁcation of the auditory feedforward synapses that causes an\nenlargement of the auditory RF of the multisensory neuron to\ninclude the far space (where the auditory stimulus was localized\nduring the training, Figure 3). Such model result is consistent\nwith single-cell recordings in monkey, showing that the visual\nhand-centered RF of parietal multisensory neurons extends to\ncover the far space after a tool-use training period (Iriki et al.,\n1996; Hihara et al., 2006).\nFigure 4B shows network responses to audio-tactile stimuli.\nTactile RTs obtained at the different sound positions are shown\nbefore training and after the synchronous training. In both cases,\ntactile RTs became lower as the distance of the auditory stimulus\nfrom the hand decreased. However, before training, the speeding\neffect of the sound on touch occurred for sounds applied approx-\nimately within 60 cm from the hand; conversely, after training,\nRT was speeded up even by sounds at farther distances (70, 80,\nand 90 cm). These patterns of tactile RTs can be explained as fol-\nlows. When the auditory stimulus falls within the auditory RF of\nthe multisensory neuron, it participates—together with the tac-\ntile stimulus—to the activation of the multisensory neuron. In\nthis condition, the multisensory neuron reaches its maximum\nactivation level more quickly and speeds up—via the feedback\nsynapses—the activation in the unisensory tactile area, decreas-\ning the tactile RT of the network. This speeding effect does not\noccur when the auditory stimulus is not able to trigger the multi-\nsensory neuron (i.e., when it falls outside the auditory RF of the\nmultisensory neuron). Accordingly, the expansion of the auditory\nRF of the multimodal neuron after training (seeFigures 3, 4A),\ngives rise to a decrease of tactile RT by means of auditory stim-\nuli applied at farther locations in space then before training. The\nnetwork’s tactile RT’s at the different sound positions were ﬁtted\nwith a sigmoidal function (separately, before training and after\ntraining): the sigmoid central point estimated via the ﬁtting pro-\ncedure was taken as an index of the critical distance at which the\nsound started affecting RT, i.e., where the boundary of PPS was\nlocated (see Supplementary Material for more details on the ﬁt-\nting procedure). The model predicts that after training the central\npoint of the sigmoid was shifted at a greater distance from the\nhand than before training (CI\n95% = 78.1 ÷ 88.2 cm after training\nvs. CI95% = 57.4 ÷ 63.2 cm before training). It is worth notic-\ning that results obtained inFigure 4 depend on all mechanisms\nincluded in the network: large RFs of auditory neurons, summa-\ntion of tactile and auditory inputs at multisensory level, synaptic\nHebbian rule, feedback synapses from multisensory to unisensory\nareas.\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 4| 6\nSerino et al.

No signiﬁcant difference in the network\nresponse was observed between the experiments run before and\nafter the asynchronous training (Figures 5A,B). In particular, the\nsigmoidal function ﬁtting the relationship between network RT\nand sound distance did not exhibit a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation\nof its central point after training vs. before training (CI\n95% =\n58.6 ÷ 66.4 cm after training vs. CI95% = 57.4 ÷ 63.2c m b e f o r e\ntraining), suggesting no modiﬁcation in PPS representation. This\nnull effect is in line with the absence of any signiﬁcant change in\nthe feedforward synapses from the auditory and the multisensory\nareas of the network.\nIn conclusion, the model predicts an expansion of PPS bound-\naries as a consequence of a synchronous application of a tactile\nstimulus on the hand and an auditory stimulus far from the\nhand, simulating incoming sensory information when using a\ntool to interact with the far space. Hence, the model gener-\nates the novel hypothesis that neither the physical presence nor\nactive use of a tool is necessary to induce an extension of PPS\nexpansion. Rather, the model is able to capture contingencies\nbetween far auditory stimulation and tactile stimulation due to\ntheir temporal synchrony, as normally conveyed in case of tool\nuse.

All subjects were right-handed\nand had normal hearing and touch. All subjects, students at the\nUniversity of Bologna, gave their informed consent to partici-\npate in the study, which was performed in accordance with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethical Commission\nof the Department of Psychology, University of Bologna.\nMATERIALS AND PROCEDURES\nMeasuring PPS representation\nIn order to assess the extension of PPS representation around the\nhand, we used an audio-tactile interaction task as inCanzoneri\net al. (2013a) and T eneggi et al. (2013),( s e eFigure 6). During\nthe experiment, subjects were comfortably seated beside a table,\nwhich the audiotactile apparatus was mounted on. This con-\nsisted of (a) two loudspeakers (hidden from view), one placed\nclose to the participants’ right hand (at∼5 cm), the other one\nplaced at a distance of∼100 cm from the near loudspeaker, thus\nfar from the participant; and (b) a constant current electrical\nstimulator (DS7A, Digitimer, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom),\ncontrolling a pair of neurological electrodes (Neuroline, Ambu,\nBallerup, Denmark), attached on the participant’s right hand.\nAuditory stimuli were samples of pink noise of 3000 ms dura-\ntion, whose intensity was manipulated in order to generate two\nkinds of sounds: IN sounds gave the impression of a sound source\nmoving from the far to the near loudspeaker, i.e., toward the sub-\nject; OUT sounds gave the impression of a sound source moving\nin the opposite direction, i.e., receding from the subject. During\neach trial, either an IN or an OUT sound was presented, while, in\n77% of the trials, subjects also received a tactile stimulus on their\nright hand. The remaining trials were catch trials with auditory\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 4| 8\nSerino et al.

On each trial, the tactile\nstimulus was delivered at one out of ﬁve possible different delays from\nsound onset, so that it was processed when the sound was perceived at a\ndifferent distance from the subject’s body (from D1, very far, to D5, very\nclose).\nstimulation only. Subjects were asked to respond vocally as fast as\npossible to the tactile target, when present, trying to ignore con-\ncurrent sounds. Tactile RTs were recorded via a voice-activated\nrelays. A custom-made software (C.I.R.O.) was used to control\nstimuli administration and responses recording.\nThe tactile stimulus was delivered at different temporal delays\nfrom the onset of the auditory stimulus, so that touch was pro-\ncessed when the sound was perceived at different locations with\nr e s p e c tt ot h es u b j e c t ’ sb o d y .F i v ed i f f e r e n td e l a y sf r o mT 1t oT 5\n(300, 800, 1500, 2200, 2700 ms) were used both for approaching\nand receding sounds. A sound localization experiment, published\nin Canzoneri et al. (2012), showed that at every temporal delay,\nsounds were perceived in a different position of space with respect\nto the stimulated body part. Given the equivalent segmentation\nof the different temporal delays for the two kinds of sounds, there\nwas a spatial correspondence between the perceived position of\nIN and OUT sounds at T1 IN and T5 OUT (farthest distance\nfrom the body) and at T2 IN and T4 OUT (far distance), T3\nIN and T3 OUT (intermediate distance), T4 IN and T2 OUT\n(close distance), T5 IN and T1 OUT (closest distance). Therefore,\nthe corresponding temporal delays were recoded in terms of per-\nceived sound distance from D1 – farthest distance—to D5 –\nclosest distance.\nSynchronous audio-tactile training\nDuring the training participants were blindfolded and sat down\nwith their right arm resting palm down on a table beside them.\nParticipants received different trains of audio-tactile stimuli. Each\ntrain consisted of 10 tactile stimuli and 10 auditory stimuli,\nsynchronously presented. Tactile stimulation was administered\nthrough two solenoids applied at the tip of the right index ﬁnger\n(M and E Solve, Rochester, UK). The auditory stimulation con-\nsisted in an ecologic sound (the tapping of a pencil on a table)\npreviously recorded. In this way, audio and tactile stimulation\nused for the training (i.e., ecological sounds and vibro-tactile\nstimulation) was different from that used for measuring PPS rep-\nresentation (i.e., pink noise and electrocutaneous stimulation).\nThe sound was presented through two loudspeakers, placed on\nthe table at a distance of≈100 cm from participants’ hand. A\nPC running C.I.R.O. software (www.cnc.unibo.psice.unibo/ciro)\nwas used to control the presentation of the stimuli. During the\ntraining participants received 23 trains of stimuli, interleaved with\n22 interstimulus intervals. Each train lasted 5000 ms. The inter\nstimuli interval randomly varied between 4000 and 6000 ms. In\norder to control for participants’ attention during the training,\nﬁve auditory stimuli (a “beep”) were randomly presented during\nthe inter stimuli intervals. Participants were asked to respond to\nthe “beep” stimuli by tapping their foot on the ﬂoor. Each training\nsession lasted around 5 min.\nAsynchronous auditory training\nThe same auditory and tactile stimuli used for the synchronous\ntraining were used for the asynchronous training, but in the lat-\nter condition auditory and tactile stimuli were presented with a\nsystematic temporal delay of 500 ms between them. This way, nei-\nther a spatial (tactile stimulus at the hand and auditory stimulus\nin the far space) nor a temporal coincidence was present between\nauditory and tactile events.\nDesign\nParticipants performed both the Synchronous and the\nAsynchronous auditory training in two different days. In\neach day of testing, we measured PPS representation before and\nafter the training sessions. In Day 1, before tool-use, participants\nperformed the audio-tactile interaction task to assess PPS\nrepresentation in a baseline condition. Then, they performed two\nsessions of the synchronous auditory training. Each session was\nintermingled with an assessment session, consisting of one block\nof the audio-tactile interaction task. On a different day, partic-\nipants underwent the same procedure with the asynchronous\ntraining. The order of synchronous or asynchronous training was\ncounterbalanced between subjects.\nRESULTS\nParticipants were extremely accurate in responding to the beep\nstimuli during both the synchronous and asynchronous train-\ning, meaning that they paid attention during the training (mean\naccuracy 98.6 and 98.5%). In order to compare the extent of PPS\nrepresentation before and after the training in the synchronous\nand asynchronous conditions, we analyzed RTs to the tactile target\nas a function of the different perceived distance of the approach-\ning and receding sounds at the time of tactile stimulation. T o this\naim, we run a mixed ANOV A on tactile RTs with Training con-\ndition (Synchronous, Asynchronous), Session (Before Training,\nAfter Training), Sound (IN, OUT) and Distance (from D1 to D5)\nas within subjects factors, and Order of training (Synchronous–\nAsynchronous; Asynchronous–Synchronous) as between subject\na n df a c t o r .R T se x c e e d i n gm o r et h a nt w os t a n d a r dd e v i a t i o n s\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 4| 9\nSerino et al.

We have repeatedly shown that the\npresent task is especially sensitive to approaching as compared\nto receding sounds (Canzoneri et al., 2012; T eneggi et al., 2013),\ntherefore here we focused on results concerning the IN sounds\nonly (OUT sounds data are reported inTa b l e 1). Before Training,\nfor the IN sound, the function describing the relationship\nbetween tactile RTs and the perceived position of sound in space\nshowed that tactile RTs progressively sped up as the perceived\nsounds’ distance from the body decreased (SeeFigure 7A).\nIn particular, RTs at D1 (mean RTs ± S.E.M; 517 ms ±\n23) and D2 (497 ms± 24)—when sounds were perceived far\nfrom the body—were signiﬁcantly slower as compared to D3\n(464 ms± 22), D4 (459± 23 ms), and D5 (455 ms± 26, allps <\n0.01, Newman-Keuls corrected)—when sounds were perceived\nclose to the body. The spatial modulation of tactile perception\ndue to sound position indicates that the critical spatial range\nwhere sounds became effective in modulating tactile RTs were\nlocalized between D2 and D3, suggesting that, normally, the\nboundaries of PPS representation around the upper limb could\nbe localized at that location (also see Canzoneri et al., 2012,\n2013a,b). Interestingly, those boundaries were extended after the\nSynchronous training, as shown by a change in the function\ndescribing the relationship between the perceived sound position\nand tactile RTs. After the training, indeed, RTs at D2 (470 ms±\n23), associated with a previously perceived far position in space,\nwere no more signiﬁcantly different as compared to RTs in D3\n(450 ms± 22), D4 (439 ms± 22), and D5 (439 ms± 22), but they\nwere statistically different only from RTs at D1 (p < 0.03). Thus,\nthe critical spatial range where sounds became effective in modu-\nlating tactile RTs shifted after the training up to include positions\nmore distant from the hand, i.e., between D2 and D1, whereas\nit was located between D3 and D2 before the training. Indeed,\nRTs at D2, and not at any other distance, were signiﬁcantly\nfaster after synchronous training as compared to before training\n(p < 0.02).\nFor the Asynchronous training condition, the ANOV A con-\nducted on RTs with Session (Before Training, After Training),\nSound (IN, OUT) and Distance (from D1 to D5) showed a signif-\nicant Sound × Distance interaction [F\n(4, 60) = 6.86, p < 0.001;\nη2 = 0.31]. The pattern of results both for IN and OUT sounds\nmirrors the same effect found for the Synchronous condition\nbefore training: as sound distance from the body decreased, RTs\nprogressively shortened. Newman-Keuls post-hoc comparisons\nconﬁrmed this effect: for the IN sound tactile RTs at D1 (Mean\nRTs ± S.E.M, 484 ms± 24) and D2 (481 ms± 26), when the\nsound was perceived far from the body, were slower compared to\nRTs at D3 (444 ms± 25), D4 (440 ms± 28), and D5 (433 ms,±\n25, allps <0.01), when the sound was perceived close to the body\n(data for the OUT sound are reported inTa b l e 1). Importantly,\nthe space dependent modulation of RTs due to sound position was\nnot different before and after the training session, as the three-\nway interaction Session× Sound × Distance was not signiﬁcant\n[F\n(4, 60) = 0.39, p = 0.82, η2 = 0.02], as well as the main effect of\nSession [F(1, 15) = 1.98, p = 0.18, η2 = 0.12]. Thus, the bound-\naries of PPS representation were localized between D2 and D3,\nboth before and after the training (seeFigure 7B).\nDISCUSSION\nSince Iriki’s (1996) seminal paper, neurophysiological, neuropsy-\nchological and behavioral studies have supported the view that\nthe experience of using a tool to act upon a portion of space,\nnormally not reachable by the upper limb, extends PPS rep-\nresentation (see for reviews, Maravita and Iriki, 2004; Làdavas\nand Serino, 2008). Although this conclusion is generally accepted\n(but see Holmes, 2012 a n db e l o wf o ra na l t e r n a t i v ev i e w ) ,t h e\nmechanism underlying PPS extension due to tool-use is largely\nunknown.\nHere we test the prediction, generated by our neurocompu-\ntational approach, that extension of PPS is the consequence of a\nmechanism capturing the synchronicity between a tactile stim-\nulus at the hand and an auditory (or visual) stimulus in the\nfar space, even without any use of the tool. In term of sensory\ninputs to the brain, this synchronous stimulation mimics the\nsensory-motor consequences of tool-use: while using the tool, an\nauditory (and/or visual) stimulus from the space, where the tool\nis operated, is temporally correlated with a tactile stimulation\nat the hand, transmitted via the tool.

We measured the extension of PPS repre-\nsentation around the hand before and after such training, as well\nas before and after a control training with asynchronous stim-\nulation. In line with previous evidence (Canzoneri et al., 2012,\n2013a,b; T eneggi et al., 2013; Noel et al., 2014), we showed that a\nsound approaching the body speeds up RT for tactile stimuli as far\nthe sound is perceived at a given distance from the body. Such dis-\ntance can be considered the boundary of PPS representation. The\nPPS boundary was localized at a farther position of space after\nthe synchronous training as compared to before the training. On\nthe contrary, after the asynchronous training, the PPS boundaries\ndid not move to farther distance, thus showing that the temporal\ncoincidence between the tactile stimulus at the hand and the audi-\ntory stimulus from the far space during the training is a necessary\ncondition for extending PPS representation.\nThe present behavioral results and the computational ﬁnd-\nings obtained here and in our previous studies (Magosso et al.,\n2010b) are compatible with neurophysiological results in mon-\nkeys showing that hand-centered visual RFs of neurons located in\nthe intraparietal sulcus elongated after that monkeys used a rake\nto retrieve pieces of food placed in the far space (Iriki et al., 1996).\nThis effect has been attributed to the formation of new func-\ntional synapses from high-order visual areas to the intraparietal\ncortex (Ishibashi et al., 2002; Hihara et al., 2006). Such neuro-\nphysiological effect can be considered the biological counter-part\nof the strengthening of synapses from unimodal visual or auditory\nareas to multisensory areas based on a Hebbian-like mechanism\npredicted by our neural network model, and supported by the\npresent experimental ﬁndings.\nThe striking result from the present study is that a change in\nPPS representation, mimicking that obtained after tool-use, can\nbe evoked also when a tool is neither actually used nor present.\nA key factor, instead, is feeding the neural network with the same\nsensory stimulation produced by tool-use activity, in the present\ncase the auditory stimulation due to the sound produced by the\ntool when hitting an object placed in the far space and the con-\ncurrent tactile stimulation at the hand handling the tool. This\nconclusion might be surprising with respect to the dominant view\nin the literature suggesting that actively using the tool is nec-\nessary for extending PPS representation, since a prolonged, but\npassive exposure to a tool have no effect (Farnè and Làdavas,\n2000; Maravita et al., 2001). The latter view ﬁts with a stan-\ndard deﬁnition of tool as an object physically and actively used\nto act upon other objects (seeBeck, 1980; Holmes and Spence,\n2006). However, previous and the present ﬁndings show that\nPPS representation can extend also in conditions of virtual, not\nphysical interaction, and even in absence of action. For instance,\nBassolino et al. (2010)demonstrated that using a mouse, a tech-\nnological device which establishes a virtual—but not physical—\nconnection between near and far space (Goldenberg and Iriki,\n2007), extended PPS representation from the space around the\nhand to that around the computer screen where the mouse cur-\nsor was operated. In that case, however, a tool was still present\nand participants had active experience of tool-use. In the present\nstudy, instead, PPS extension was obtained in absence of action.\nTaken together these ﬁndings suggest that neither a physical, nor\na functional inter-action between near and far space is neces-\nsary to extend PPS representation. Rather, the sensory-feedback\nlinked to tool-use seems a sufﬁcient factor to trigger plastic-\nity in PPS representation: thanks to a Hebbian-like mechanism,\nafter prolonged synchronous tactile stimulation at the hand and\nmultisensory stimulation from the far space, multisensory areas\nassociate the two stimuli, as if they occurred from a function-\nally equivalent sector of space. Note, however, that we are not\nclaiming that action is irrelevant for PPS extension after tool-\nuse. We are rather suggesting that, under natural conditions, PPS\nareas process the multisensory consequences of actions related to\ntool-use, i.e., contingent and temporally correlated near and far\nstimulation, and that those inputs are critical for plasticity in PPS\nrepresentations.\nIt is also important to acknowledge that other authors ques-\nt i o nt h ei d e at h a tt h ee f f e c t so ft o o l - u s ed e p e n do nac h a n g ei n\nthe receptive ﬁeld of PPS neurons, by proposing instead, that\nthe tool-use results in an automatic, multisensory, shift of spa-\ntial attention to the space where the tool exerts its effect (see e.g.,\nHolmes et al., 2007; Holmes, 2012). Our neural network model\ncan account for attentional effects of tool-use. Prolonged tool use,\nor related stimulation, might increase crossmodal attention at far\nportions of space because after tool-use multisensory neurons are\nmore likely to be activated by far stimuli, in any modality. On the\nother hand, however, an explanation based on attentional shift\ncannot explain why such effect arises after synchronous, but not\nafter asynchronous near–far stimulation. In fact, a pure atten-\ntional account should generate the opposite prediction, because\nin condition of synchronous near and far stimulation, two dif-\nferent sectors of space are concurrently activated, and spatial\nattention is therefore deployed at the two locations, rather than\nshifting toward the far space. For these reasons, we believe that the\ni n t e r p r e t a t i o no ft h ee f f e c t so ft o o l - u s ep r o p o s e di nt h ep r e s e n t\npaper is more parsimonious, more able to account for multi-\nple results and more plausible from a neurophysiological point\nof view than an explanation only based on the shift of spatial\nattention.\nThis kind of stimulation embedded in our training is reminis-\ncent of the paradigms used to induce the Rubber Hand Illusion\n(RHI). In RHI experiments, a realistic fake hand can be perceived\nas a part of one’s own body if concurrent visuo-tactile stimula-\ntion is seen on the fake hand and felt on one’s own hand, hidden\nfrom view (Botvinick and Cohen, 1998). Ehrsson and colleagues\n(Ehrsson et al., 2005; Makin et al., 2008; Ehrsson, 2012)p r o p o s e d\nthat the illusory body parts ownership that people experience\nduring the RHI might involve bimodal and/or trimodal neurons\nin premotor and parietal cortices that normally respond only to\nstimuli presented within one’s own PPS. Recently,Blanke (2012)\nsuggested that, during the RHI, seeing the rubber hand being\nstimulated and experiencing a synchronous tactile stimulation on\none’s own hand triggers a shift of the receptive ﬁeld of bimodal\nneurons toward the fake body part. This effect might generate a\nchange in body perception, that is the rubber hand is perceived\nas the real hand. This interpretation of the RHI is in line with a\nFrontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience www.frontiersin.org February 2015 | Volume 9 | Article 4| 12\nSerino et al. Plasticity in peripersonal space representation\nrecent fMRI study ofBrozzoli et al. (2012)measuring how activ-\nity of human premotor and parietal cortices coding the PPS varies\nin response to visual stimuli presented close to the subject’s real\nhand or to a rubber hand, placed at a distance. They found that\nonly when subjects experienced ownership for the rubber hand,\nthrough induction of the RHI, PPS areas responded also to stim-\nuli presented close to the rubber hand. These ﬁndings suggest that\nvisual RF of multisensory neurons extended to incorporate the\nrubber hand into PPS representation. Results from the present\nstudy offers a simple explanation for Brozzoli et al. ’s ﬁndings and\nmight inspire neural models explaining the RHI: synchronicity\nbetween tactile stimulation at the hand and auditory or visual\nstimulation from a space location other than that of the hand\nseems a sufﬁcient condition to trigger PPS extension. This mecha-\nnism, however, does not necessarily imply any sense of ownership\nfor stimuli at the far space, being those stimuli a rubber hand, a\nt i po fat o o l ,o re v e na ne m p t ys p a c e .\nT o sum up, the present study offers empirical support to the\nunconventional hypothesis, generated by a neural network model,\nthat plasticity in PPS representation after tool-use does not strictly\ndepend on the function of the tool nor from the actions per-\nformed with the tool, but it is triggered by the sensory feedback\nof tool-use, i.e., synchronous tactile stimulation at the hand,\ndue to holding the tool, and multisensory (auditory or visual)\nstimulation from the far space, where the tool is operated.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found\nonline at: http://www .frontiersin.org/journal/10.3389/fnbeh.\n2015.00004/abstract\nREFERENCES\nAlais, D., and Burr, D.
