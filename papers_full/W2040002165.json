    "abstract": "A lumped quadrature coupler based on a ferromagnetic core is proposed for high‐frequency (HF) application. The four terminals of the transformer are connected to the four ports, whereas two inductors and two capacitors are connected between two adjacent ports. The bandwidth is only limited by magnitude imbalance. A 13.56 MHz prototype is designed and tested. A 69% bandwidth is achieved with ±3 dB magnitude imbalance. Within the frequency band, the measured return loss is greater than 31.57 dB, port‐to‐port isolation is greater than 33.21 dB and the phase imbalance is &lt;2°.",
