    "abstract": "This paper focuses on fault analysis of a distribution feeder which employs Solid State Transformers (SSTs) rather than magnetic transformers in order to facilitate large scale integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) into the system. To estimate the fault current profile on such a feeder, the paper proposes a new method which extends the capability of conventional short-circuit analysis method. Performance of the proposed method has been assessed by simulations on a sample distribution feeder.",
