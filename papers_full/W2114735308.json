    "abstract": "In this work, the non-liner voltage distribution in transformer winding is investigated that occurs due switching and lightning. Transformer winding is modeled in the alternative transients program (ATP) version of Electromagnetic transients program (EMTP-RV). EMTPsoftware is used to simulate the very fast transient overvoltage.An experimental setup that consist of , Recurrent surge generator, CRO and transformer winding model has been developed and voltages measured at different point along the transformer winding.Simulation results show good agreement with the experimental result.",
