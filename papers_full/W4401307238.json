    "abstract": "Traditional legal retrieval systems designed to retrieve legal documents,\\nstatutes, precedents, and other legal information are unable to give\\nsatisfactory answers due to lack of semantic understanding of specific\\nquestions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in a\\nvariety of natural language processing tasks, which inspired us that we train a\\nLLM in the legal domain to help legal retrieval. However, in the Chinese legal\\ndomain, due to the complexity of legal questions and the rigour of legal\\narticles, there is no legal large model with satisfactory practical application\\nyet. In this paper, we present DeliLaw, a Chinese legal counselling system\\nbased on a large language model. DeliLaw integrates a legal retrieval module\\nand a case retrieval module to overcome the model hallucination. Users can\\nconsult professional legal questions, search for legal articles and relevant\\njudgement cases, etc. on the DeliLaw system in a dialogue mode. In addition,\\nDeliLaw supports the use of English for counseling. we provide the address of\\nthe system: https://data.delilegal.com/lawQuestion.\\n",
