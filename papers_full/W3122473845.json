Bigdeliet al.: Intelligent Classifiers in Distinguishing Transformer Faults Using Frequency Response Analysis\nρ Normalized correlation coefﬁcient\nRXY Correlation factor\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNowadays, intelligent monitoring of equipment in power\nsystems is very important. Power transformers are one of the\nmost critical and expensive equipment in a power generation\nand transmission network. Their failures will impose high\ncosts and reduce the reliability of the power grid. Therefore,\nthe care and protection of transformers during operation is\nnecessary. One of the methods used in recent years to monitor\nthe status of transformers is the FRA method. The FRA\nmethod, also known as the TF approach, is a comparative\nmethod [1]. In this method, the measurements are made on\na typical transformer in the healthy condition are kept as the\nreference measurement with the customer or the manufac-\nturer. After gathering the reference (healthy) TF in a typical\ntransformer, the TFs results can be measured (from similar\nterminals) and compared with the reference at any desired\ntime. By comparing the reference TF with new measure-\nments, the type and severity of the transformer’s fault can be\ndetermined. Unfortunately, the existing standards in the ﬁeld\nof FRA [2], [3] have focused on measurement requirements\nand test circuits, and a precise standard for interpreting FRA\nmeasurement results has not yet been developed. Therefore,\nin recent years, many studies have been conducted on the\ninterpretation of FRA measurement’s results to obtain infor-\nmation about transformer faults [4]–[8]. Given that the ﬁrst\nstep is to identify the type of fault, the focus of current\nresearch is to classify faults.\nThe most important faults that occur in the transformer and\ncan be identiﬁed by the FRA method are:\n• Axial displacement (AD)\n• Radial deformation (RD)\n• Disc space variation (DSV)\n• Short circuit (SC)\nBesides, the deformation of core sheets (DCS) is also\ndetectable by the FRA, which has not been well studied in\nthe literature.\nVarious methods have been proposed in the literature\nto identify the type of fault and classify them, which can\nbe divided into two main categories. The ﬁrst category\nincludes methods according to which faults’ classiﬁcation is\nsolely based on the rate of variations in numerical indices\n(statistical and mathematical indices) in speciﬁc frequency\nranges [9]–[18]. The second category includes methods that\nuse intelligent classiﬁers to distinguish faults [19]–[25]. In\nthese methods, the necessary features of frequency response\n(mainly the statistical and numerical indices) are extracted,\nand these features are used for training and testing classiﬁers.\nIn [9], the most important numerical indices have been\nintroduced. By calculating them in different fault conditions\nand comparing them to the healthy condition, the indices that\nhave a better ability to detect defects have been identiﬁed. In\n[10], the transformer’s TFs in AD, RD and also simultaneous\nAD-RD fault conditions are obtained with the help of the\nﬁnite element method. Then, using statistical indices such\nas ASLE and DABS, the transformer faults were detected.\nIn [11], with the introduction of MMR based on the ED\nindex; the type of transformer winding fault is identiﬁed. A\nnew method using the wavelet technique and characteristic\nimpedance for classifying defects has been proposed in [12].\nUsing antenna installation on the transformer and by ana-\nlyzing the electromagnetic waves received from the antenna\nbased on the ED index, a distinction is made between the\nfaults in [13]. In [14], the measured TFs from the transformer\nare mapped to a two-dimensional space, and the fault type\nis detected based on a vector-based approach. In [15], the\ntransformer’s TFs are ﬁrst estimated, and then a distinction\nis made between the faults by plotting the Nyquist diagram.\nNonetheless, only two faults, AD and RD, have been con-\nsidered in these studies. A new characteristic called α is\nintroduced based on the ρ index to distinguish transformer\nfaults in [16]. However, three faults, AD, RD, and DSV ,\nhave been investigated, while SC and DCS faults are not\nconsidered. In [17], CCF index is introduced, and various\nfaults of the transformer are clustered. However, three faults\nAD, RD, and SC are clustered, and DSV and DCS are not\nconsidered in the fault detection process. In [18], a new index\ncalled IMGM is proposed for fault type detection and all\nﬁve defects have been considered. The IMGM distinguishes\nfaults with probability and it is unable to certainly detect the\ntype of fault. Also, its conclusion emphasizes that intelligent\nclassiﬁers should be used to detect transformer faults in the\nfuture.\nIn [19], [20], based on the TF estimation with the help of\nvector ﬁtting, the necessary features of the measured TFs for\nfour faults AD, RD, DSV , and SC were extracted and these\nfaults are classiﬁed by using PNN [19] and SVM [20]. A\ndistinction has been made between electrical and mechanical\nfaults (AD and RD only) and the inrush current through ANN\nand the DT in [21]. Classiﬁcation of RD, DSV , and SC faults\nin three different classes has been done in [22], [23]. In [22],\nthe measured frequency response from the transformer is\ndivided into three frequency ranges and using binary imaging\nand SVM, a distinction is made between the faults. In [23],\nstatistical and numerical indices were used for SVM training\nand testing; nonetheless, the frequency division was not per-\nformed. A new windowing-based approach to determine the\ntype of fault has been proposed in [24]. After windowing and\ncalculating the indices, the FDA method was used to separate\nthe faults. In [25], CCF was used to extract the characteristic,\nand these features were used for ANN training and testing to\nseparate the three faults AD, RD, and SC.\nAs noted, several methods have been proposed to classify\ntransformer faults, but none of these studies has considered\nDCS fault, and in many of these studies, two or eventually\nthree faults have been investigated. The faults classiﬁcation\ncan be more difﬁcult and complicated with the increase in\nthe number of defects that can be identiﬁed by the FRA\nmethod. Also, one or two classiﬁers have been used in\n13982 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. Bigdeliet al.: Intelligent Classifiers in Distinguishing Transformer Faults Using Frequency Response Analysis\nFIGURE 1. TFs measurement circuits.\nprevious researches, and the number of features extracted\nfor classiﬁers training has been limited. To address these\nshortcomings, this article examines all ﬁve faults. For this\npurpose, the required TFs are extracted by performing the\nnecessary measurements on different transformers in healthy\ncondition and different fault conditions (AD, RD, DSV , SC,\nand DCS). Four intelligent classiﬁers, PNN, DT, SVM, and\nk-NN, are used to classify faults into ﬁve different classes.\nA new feature is proposed for the training and validation of\nintelligent classiﬁers by calculating the well-known statistical\nand numerical indices. Data obtained from real transformers\nare applied to classiﬁers to evaluate the performance of them.\nAnalysis of the results shows that by dividing the frequency\nranges of the measured TFs into 10 equal intervals and using\nSVM and k-NN classiﬁers with MAX, CSD, and R XY numer-\nical indices as the feature, the best performance is obtained.\nThe innovative contributions of the proposed approach if\ncompared to previous studies are as follows:\n1- Proposing a new feature based on numerical indices for\ntraining and testing of intelligent classiﬁers,\n2- Comparison of the performance of four well-known\nintelligent classiﬁers (PNN, DT, SVM, k-NN) in dis-\ntinguishing transformer faults and proposing the most\nsuitable classiﬁer,\n3- Apply the proposed feature to real transformers which\nare faulty during operation,\n4- Compare the performance of different numerical\nindices and determine the reliable method.\nII. CASE STUDIES AND MEASUREMENTS\nIn the measurements carried out in this study, the circuit of\nFigure 1 is used [3]. It is important to note that in this ﬁgure,\ninstead of the output voltage (V out), the output current can be\nmeasured so that the TF will be of the admittance type.\nTo evaluate intelligent classiﬁers’ performance, it is nec-\nessary to establish a database of transformers in healthy and\nfaulty conditions (with different intensities of the fault). For\nthis purpose, two sets of transformers are tested.\nA. THE FIRST GROUP OF TRANSFORMERS\nThe ﬁrst group of transformers is model transformers that\nthe desired faults are intentionally created on them. A model\ntransformer is a transformer whose structure is exactly the\nsame as an actual transformer, but its voltage and power level\nmay not be real. Therefore, it is used only for laboratory\nstudies. In addition, different connections are available from\nits windings and it is possible to intentionally apply various\ndefects on the transformer in order to obtain a more complete\ndatabase. This group of transformers is tested with almost\nsimilar structures, and one of the studied faults (AD, RD,\nDSV , SC, and DCS) is applied to each of them. The descrip-\ntion of these test objects is as follows:\nCase 1:A transformer is consisting of a HV winding made\nof 31 pairs of 6-turns discs, and a LV winding made of\n4 layers of 99 turns is used to study the AD of the windings\nrelative to each other. The nominal power and voltage of\nthis transformer are 1.3 MV A and 10 kV , respectively. In\nexperiments performed, the internal layer winding is moved\naxially in 8 steps (1 cm in each step) respect to the outer disc\nwinding.\nCase 2: The transformer tested for RD study has a HV\nwinding consisting of 30 pairs of 11-turns discs and a LV\nwinding made of one layer of 23-turns. The rated power\nand voltage of this transformer are 1.3 MV A and 10 kV ,\nrespectively. In this test object, the disc winding is deformed\nin 4 steps in a radial direction [16].\nCase 3:The transformer studied in this section is the same\nas Case 2. Another healthy winding has been selected to\nstudy the effect of DSV on frequency response. The distance\nbetween the discs in the healthy condition is 5 mm. This\ndistance has been changed to 7.5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mm\nto consider the effect of the DSV on the TFs. The distance\nbetween the discs was changed in 3 locations (discs 2, 4, and\n16) to study the effect of the fault better.\nCase 4:A sample transformer is consisting of a HV wind-\ning made of 30 discs of 11-turns with 1 MV A rated power and\n20 kV rated voltage is used to investigate the effect of DCS on\nthe frequency response. The winding is mounted on the core,\nand the TF of this winding is measured in two conditions.\nFirst, in the healthy condition and then by deformation of the\ncore, the TF is measured again.\nCase 5: In this case, the HV winding of a 10 kV and\n1.2 MV A transformer is tested. The winding is including\n60 discs with 9 turns in each disc. All discs have an accessible\nbranch that makes it possible to measure TFs at different\nlocations along the winding.\nB. THE SECOND GROUP OF TRANSFORMERS\nThe second group is real transformers that exposed to faults\nduring operation. Initially, the type of fault is not known, and\nafter opening its accessories, the type of fault is recognized.\nThe speciﬁcation of these transformers is as follows:\nCase 6: This real case is a 20/0.4 kV and 0.4 MV A dis-\ntribution transformer with a HV winding made of 40 discs,\n17 turns in each disc, and a LV winding made of 2 layers,\nVOLUME 9, 2021 13983\nM. Bigdeliet al.: Intelligent Classifiers in Distinguishing Transformer Faults Using Frequency Response Analysis\nFIGURE 2. Some of the measured TFs of transformers.\n13984 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. Bigdeliet al.: Intelligent Classifiers in Distinguishing Transformer Faults Using Frequency Response Analysis\n9 turns in each layer. Due to improper transportation of the\ntransformer from the production site to the installation site,\nthe AD fault has occurred.\nCase 7: This is a distribution transformer with the rated\nspeciﬁcation of 20/0.4 kV and 1 MV A with a HV winding\nmade of 50 discs, 11 turns in each disc, and a LV winding\nmade of 2 layers, 11 turns in each layer. This transformer has\nan RD fault as a result of a short circuit near the transformer\nterminals.\nCase 8: In this transformer, a DSV fault occurred due to\nthe accident of the vehicle carrying the transformer. The rated\nvoltage and power are 63/20 kV and 30 MV A, respectively.\nThe windings consist of a HV winding made of 80 discs,\n15 turns in each disc, and a LV winding made of 5 layers,\n64 turns in each layer.\nCase 9: This real case is a 20/0.4 kV and 0.5 MV A dis-\ntribution transformer with a HV winding made of 45 discs,\n13 turns in each disc, and a LV winding made of 2 layers,\n10 turns in each layer. The transformer was thrown to the\nground while mounting on a vehicle, and a DSV fault has\noccurred.\nCase 10:This is a transformer with the same speciﬁcations\nas the Case 7, which has a DCS fault.\nThe measurement results of some of these transformers\nare shown in Figure 2. The experimental results point out\nthat each defect affects a speciﬁc frequency range. However,\nthe type of faults cannot be determined by the appearance of\nthe measured TFs, and a fault detection method should be\nused for this purpose, which will be discussed in the next\nsections.\nIII. INTELLIGENT CLASSIFIERS\nIn this paper, four methods of PNN, DT, SVM, and k-NN\nare used to detect the type of transformer fault. The theory of\nthese methods has been extensively studied in the literature\n[26]–[29]. The ability of these methods to solve transformer\nfaults classiﬁcation problems has also been demonstrated\nin [19]–[25]. Therefore, in this section, these methods are\nbrieﬂy discussed.\nA. PROBABILISTIC NEURAL NETWORK\nThe design of an ANN includes the selection of inputs,\noutputs, network structure, and neuron weight vectors [26].\nThe choice of network topology is made in an experimental\nprocess with trial and error to optimize the number of layers\nand neurons in the network. The PNN structure is a three-\nlayer network. When an input vector is applied to the network,\nthe ﬁrst layer calculates the input vector distance from the\ntraining inputs, thus providing vector whose elements deter-\nmine the distance between the new input and the training\ninput. The second layer uses the output of the ﬁrst layer\nto produce the vector of probabilities as the output of the\nnetwork. Finally, the competitive transfer function in the third\nlayer selects the maximum number of probabilities from the\nprobability vector and produces 1 for that and 0 for the rest\nof the probabilities.\nFIGURE 3. Flowchart of proposed method for finding the best interval for\ncalculating indices.\nB. DECISION TREE\nThis method is a data mining tool for decision support that\nuses a tree-link model of decisions. It isn’t easy to ﬁnd the\noptimal tree in practice, but powerful algorithms such as ID3,\nC4.5, CART, and CHAID have been proposed for this pur-\npose. One of the essential advantages of the C4.5 algorithm is\nthe ability to convert trained trees into a series of if-then rules.\nOn the other hand, no feature extraction technique is required\nin this method [27]. Therefore, this algorithm is used in this\nresearch.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 13985\nM. Bigdeliet al.: Intelligent Classifiers in Distinguishing Transformer Faults Using Frequency Response Analysis\nC. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE\nIt is one of the most powerful classiﬁers that can perform both\nlinear and nonlinear data separation operations. One of the\nbest kernel functions used in SVM is the Gaussian function,\nwhich is deﬁned as follows [28]:\nK(X,Y ) =exp(− 1\n2σ2 ∥X −Y ∥2) (1)\nwhere, X and Y are the input and output vectors, respectively,\nand is a constant value that is determined by the type of data.\nAlso, SVM has another parameter called C, which controls\nthe amount of over-ﬁt or under-ﬁt. Accurate determining\nthe parameters of and C is very important and is usually\ndetermined by trial and error.\nD. k-NEAREST NEIGHBORS\nThe k-NN method is an efﬁcient tool for classifying data.\nThe k-NN algorithm is straightforward, and it works by\ncalculating the distance between data to put those that are\nsimilar to each other in a neighborhood. The number of\nneighbors (k) depends on the input data, but usually, an odd\nnumber is selected. When new data is applied to k-NN, the\ndistance between that data and the k neighbors closest to it\nis calculated. Any class that has more neighbors will win the\ncompetition. The two most common methods for calculating\nthe distance between data are Euclidean distance and Pearson\nmethods [29]. In this paper, the Euclidean distance is used.\nIV. THE PROPOSED METHOD FOR EXTRACTING THE\nFEATURES\nOne of the most critical parts of any pattern recognition sys-\ntem is the feature extraction. In detecting transformer faults,\nthe feature extraction is based on the comparison of data of the\nmeasured TFs with the reference TF. One of the best ways to\ncompare TFs with reference TF is to use numerical and sta-\ntistical indices. Although numerical indices have been used\nin the diagnosis of transformer defects [9]–[12], [16]–[18],\nhowever, a comprehensive comparison of the performance\nof these indices for the purpose of training the intelligent\nclassiﬁers is not seen in the literature. Therefore, in this paper,\nit is proposed that each of the indices be used separately\nas a feature. Then, the performance of each index in the\ntransformer fault classiﬁcation is evaluated to identify the\nmost reliable indicator.\nVarious numerical indices have been presented to compare\nTFs, the most important and most commonly used are:\nED =∥Y −X∥=\n√\n(Y −X)T (Y −X) (2)\nSD =\n√∑N\ni=1 (Y (i) −X(i))2\nN −1 (3)\nID =\n∫\n(Y (f ) −X(f )) df (4)\nIA =\n∫\n|Y (f ) −X(f )|df (5)\nSDA =\n∫ |Y (f ) −X(f )|df∫ |X(f )|df (6)\nASLE =\nN∑\ni=1\n⏐⏐20 log10 Y (i) −20 log10 X(i)\n⏐⏐\nN (7)\nRMSE =\n√1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n\n |Y (i)|−|X(i)|(\n1\nN\n)∑N\ni=1 |X(i)|\n\n\n2\n(8)\nE [1] = 1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n1(i);1(i) = |Y (i)|−|X(i)|(\n1\nN\n)∑N\ni=1 |X(i)|\n(9)\nσe =\n√\nvar(1) =E [1−E(1))] (10)\nσ = 1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n√\n(\nX(i)−(X(i)+Y (i))/2\n(X(i)+Y (i))/2\n)2\n+\n(\nY (i)−(X(i)+Y (i))/2\n(X(i)+Y (i))/2\n)2 (11)\nσs =100\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\nY (i) −X(i)\nX(i)\n⏐⏐⏐⏐ (12)\nMAX =max(Y (i) −X(i)) (13)\nρ =\n∑N\ni=1 (X(i) −¯X)(Y (i) −Y )√∑N\ni=1 (X(i) −¯X)2 ∑N\ni=1 (Y (i) −Y )2\n¯X = 1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nX(i),¯Y =1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nY (i) (14)\nCC =\n∑N\ni=1 X(i)Y (i)√∑N\ni=1 (X(i))2 ∑N\ni=1 (Y (i))2\n(15)\nSSE =\n∑N\ni=1 (Y (i) −X(i))2\nN (16)\nSSRE =\n∑N\ni=1 (Y (i)\nX(i) −1)2\nN (17)\nSSMMRE =\n∑N\ni=1 (max(Y (i),X(i))\nmin(Y (i),X(i)) −1)2\nN (18)\nDABS =\n∑N\ni=1 |Y (i) −X(i)|\nN (19)\nMM =\n∑N\ni=1 min(X(i),Y (i))\n∑N\ni=1 max(X(i),Y (i))\n(20)\nCSD =\n√∑N\ni=1\n[\n(X(i) −¯X) −(Y (i) −Y )\n]2\nN −1 (21)\nRXY =\n{\n10 if (1 −ρ) ≤10−10\n−log10(1 −ρ) otherwise (22)\nwhere, X and Y are the magnitude vectors of the reference\nTF and the new TF, respectively, f is the measured frequency\nvector, and N is the number of samples in a vector.\nAnother shortcoming of past well-known studies [9]–[12]\nis that in order to extract the features, the indices have been\ncalculated in the entire frequency interval (0-1MHz). Obvi-\nously, the result of this calculation will be just one numerical\nvalue, which is insufﬁcient to train the classiﬁer. In some\nstudies [16], [23], the indices have been calculated in 3 fre-\nquency intervals. However, it is not clear in which frequency\n13986 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. Bigdeliet al.: Intelligent Classifiers in Distinguishing Transformer Faults Using Frequency Response Analysis\ninterval these indices are calculated, the best performance is\nobtained for the classiﬁer. To solve this problem, in current\nresearch, the measured frequency response is divided into\ndifferent intervals. This frequency division should be such\nthat the number of data is not high because it makes the\ndecision difﬁcult for classiﬁers, and its speed will be reduced.\nAlso, if the amount of data is lower than a certain level,\nclassiﬁers will not be well trained and will produce incorrect\noutput. Therefore, in this paper, different states of frequency\ndivision are examined. To achieve a suitable result, the num-\nber of intervals is changed from 1 to 20 and the output of the\nclassiﬁers is evaluated in each interval. Figure 3 shows the\nproposed method for ﬁnding the best interval for calculating\nindices. The interval that produces the output with the highest\naccuracy for the classiﬁer is selected as the most appropriate\ninterval for calculating the numerical indices.\nIt should be noted that after calculating the mentioned\nindices in the custom frequency intervals of the TFs, these\nfeatures are applied as inputs to the classiﬁers. There-\nfore, the input matrix for each indicator can be deﬁned as\nEquation (23), as shown at the bottom of the page.\nClassiﬁer output can be numbered 1 to 5, which are\nassigned to AD, RD, DSV , DCS, and SC, respectively. There-\nfore, the output vector can be deﬁned as Equation (24), as\nshown at the bottom of the page.\nWhere, i represents the intensity of AD from 1 to 8 cm, j is\nthe degree of RD from 1 to 4, k is the intensity of DSV from\n7.5 to 25 mm and for 3 locations 2, 4 and 16, m is the intensity\nof DCS and l is the location of SC. n also represents the\nnumber of frequency intervals, which in this article is equal\nto 10. In fact, with this formatting, the samples are placed on\nthe matrix columns.\nV. CLASSIFICATION RESULTS\nIn this section, by applying the features extracted from the\nTFs to intelligent classiﬁers, their performance is evaluated.\nIn addition to test data, part of the model’s transformers data\nis used to validate classiﬁers to prevent over-ﬁtting. For this\npurpose, the K-Fold cross-validation method is used. In this\nmethod, the classiﬁcation is done K times, and in each time,\na fraction of 1/K of data is used for validation, and the rest\nis used for training. Then the mean of the errors is returned\nas the classiﬁcation error. In this paper, the value of K is\nconsidered to be 5.\nIn the ﬁrst step, the desired interval for calculating numer-\nical indices must be determined. For this purpose, the pro-\nposed ﬂowchart in Figure 3 is used. Figure 4 shows the\naccuracy of some indices for different frequency intervals of\nthe measured TFs for the SVM Classiﬁer. It is observed that\nthe highest accuracy is related to the state where the measured\nfrequency range is divided into 10 equal intervals. This has\nbeen done for all indices and classiﬁers, and a similar result\nhas been obtained.\nAfter calculating the numerical indices in 10 equal fre-\nquency intervals, the input matrix is created. Then, by apply-\ning the input matrix to the classiﬁers, the diagnosis error of\neach classiﬁer is determined. Table 1 shows the diagnosis\nerror in applying validation and test data to different classi-\nﬁers for all indices.\nExamining the results of Figure 4 and Table 1 shows that:\n1- To extract the features, the indices can be calculated\nin different frequency intervals. The highest accuracy\nis obtained when the measured TF is divided into\n10 equal frequency intervals. Therefore, it is proposed\nthat the feature extraction be performed based on the\ncalculation of numerical indices in 10 equal frequency\nintervals of the measured TF.\n2- In PNN and DT classiﬁers, the diagnosis error of test\ndata is not less than 40% for any indicator. Besides,\nthe diagnosis error of validation data is above 10%.\nTherefore, in solving the classiﬁcation problem men-\ntioned in this article, the use of these classiﬁers is not\nrecommended.\n3- In all classiﬁers, the diagnosis error for ID, IA, RMSE,\nE, σe, σ, σs indices in test data is more than 50%.\nAlso, the classiﬁcation error in these indices is high in\nvalidation data. These indices fall into the ﬁrst category.\n4- In SVM and k-NN classiﬁers, the ED, SD, SDA, ASLE,\nρ, CC, SSE, SSRE, SSMMRE, DABS, and MM indices\nhave less error than the ﬁrst category indices (validation\nerror less than 15% and test error less than 50%).\nNonetheless, the diagnosis error is still high. These\nindices fall into the second category.\n5- The third category is indices that have less error than\nother indices. These indices are MAX, CSD, and R XY.\nThe above analysis shows that for the extraction of the\nfeatures, it is better to use the third category indices and use\nSVM and k-NN classiﬁers to classify the faults. Therefore,\nthe results of these indices and classiﬁers will be examined\nin more detail.\nFigure 5 shows the diagnosis accuracy of the validation\ndata applied to the SVM and k-NN classiﬁers for the three\nMAX, CSD, and R XY indices. As can be seen, the MAX\nindex for SVM and k-NN classiﬁers has been misdiagnosed\nin two cases, which are related to AD, RD, and DCS faults.\nMisdiagnosis of DCS can signiﬁcantly affect the classiﬁer’s\nInput Matrix =\n\n\nIndex1,ADi Index1,RDj Index1,DSVk Index1,DSVm Index1,SCl\n... ... ... ... ...\nIndexn,ADi Indexn,RDj Indexn,DSVk Indexn,DSVm Indexn,SCl\n\n (23)\nOutput Vector=\n[AD1 ··· ADi RD1 ··· RDj DSV1 ··· DSVk DCS1 ··· DCSm SC1 ··· SCl\n]\n(24)\nVOLUME 9, 2021 13987\nM.

The accuracy of some indices by calculating them in different frequency intervals of measured TFs.\nTABLE 1. Classifier diagnosis error for test and validation data (in percentage).\nperformance because only one measurement result for this\nfault is available in the model transformers and not recogniz-\ning it correctly means that the classiﬁer has not been properly\ntrained for this fault and produces a 100% error. In the CSD\nindex, only one condition of AD and RD faults has been\nmisdiagnosed for each of classiﬁers. In the R XY index, the\nperformance of SVM and k-NN classiﬁers is the opposite of\ntheir performance in the CSD index.\nDespite the good results obtained in the training and vali-\ndation phase of MAX, CSD, and R XY indices, but to prove\nthe capabilities of the proposed method and generalize it,\nvarious TFs of different transformers must be examined. For\nthis purpose, the measured data from the second group of\ntransformers are used to test and verify the proposed method.\nFigure 6 shows the results of applying test data to SVM and\nk-NN classiﬁers for three indices: MAX, CSD, and R XY.\n13988 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. Bigdeliet al.: Intelligent Classifiers in Distinguishing Transformer Faults Using Frequency Response Analysis\nFIGURE 5. Performance of third category indices using K-Fold cross-validation.\nAs expected, the k-NN method in the MAX index failed to\nidentify the DCS fault correctly. Also, the SVM method in\nthis index could not accurately identify the AD fault. For\nboth classiﬁers, the R XY index only misdiagnosed AD. In the\nCSD index, for the k-NN classiﬁer, the AD fault has been\nmisdiagnosed, but in the SVM method, all fault conditions\nhave been correctly identiﬁed.\nThe results of the above analysis show that the classiﬁca-\ntion error of a classiﬁer may be somewhat high in the valida-\ntion phase. Nonetheless, in the testing phase, good accuracy\nis obtained. The reason for this is that training and validation\nof classiﬁers are performed with different intensities of a\nfault, and maybe just for certain intensity, validation is not\ncorrect that particular intensity is not available in test data.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 13989\nM. Bigdeliet al.: Intelligent Classifiers in Distinguishing Transformer Faults Using Frequency Response Analysis\nFIGURE 6. Performance of third category indices in response to test data.\nFor example, in the MAX index and with the k-NN classiﬁer,\nfor the low intensity (displacement of 1 cm) in the AD fault\nin the validation phase, the fault type is recognized as DSV .\nHowever, in the test phase, the classiﬁer’s diagnosis was\ncorrect for the transformer that had an AD fault because\nthe intensity of the fault in this transformer has been severe\n(displacement of more than 4 cm).\nIn general, for transformers studied in current research, the\nCSD index with SVM classiﬁer has the best performance\nin classifying transformer winding faults. Also, to extract\nthe features, it is better to calculate the numerical indices in\n10 equal frequency intervals of the measured TF.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nDue to the increasing use of FRA in detecting transformer\nfaults and increasing the number of faults that can be detected\nwith FRA’s help, it is necessary to provide a reliable method\nfor classifying faults. Therefore, in this paper, the most\nimportant intelligent classiﬁers (PNN, DT, SVM, and k-NN)\nwere used to classify faults. To train and test classiﬁers, a\nnew feature based on statistical and numerical indices was\nproposed. In the proposed feature, statistical indices were\ncalculated in 10 equal frequency intervals of the measured\nTFs. The required data for the extraction of the features\nwere obtained by performing the necessary measurements\non different transformers in the healthy condition and the\ndifferent faults conditions (AD, RD, DSV , DCS, and SC). By\ncalculating the indices and applying the extracted features to\nthe intelligent classiﬁers, their performance was evaluated.\nThe obtained results showed that the three features, MAX,\nCSD, and R XY with SVM and k-NN classiﬁers, have fewer\nerrors compared to other indices and classiﬁers. Among\nthese, the SVM classiﬁer with CSD feature has 97.2% accu-\nracy and 100% accuracy in diagnosing validation and testing\ndata, respectively. Therefore, it is recommended as a reliable\nmethod in the industry.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nM. Bigdeli would like to thank Dr. E.
