  "abstract": "Background Maternal mental health care is variable and with limited accessibility. Artificial intelligence (AI) conversational agents (CAs) could potentially play an important role in supporting maternal mental health and wellbeing. Our study examined data from real-world users who self-reported a maternal event while engaging with a digital mental health and wellbeing AI-enabled CA app (Wysa) for emotional support. The study evaluated app effectiveness by comparing changes in self-reported depressive symptoms between a higher engaged group of users and a lower engaged group of users and derived qualitative insights into the behaviors exhibited among higher engaged maternal event users based on their conversations with the AI CA. Methods Real-world anonymised data from users who reported going through a maternal event during their conversation with the app was analyzed. For the first objective, users who completed two PHQ-9 self-reported assessments ( n = 51) were grouped as either higher engaged users ( n = 28) or lower engaged users ( n = 23) based on their number of active session-days with the CA between two screenings. A non-parametric Mann–Whitney test (M–W) and non-parametric Common Language effect size was used to evaluate group differences in self-reported depressive symptoms. For the second objective, a Braun and Clarke thematic analysis was used to identify engagement behavior with the CA for the top quartile of higher engaged users ( n = 10 of 51).

In the\nUnited Kingdom (UK), perinatal mental health problems can\naffect 10%–20% of women either during pregnancy or within\none year of giving birth ( 12). According to the American\nPregnancy Association and Postpartum Support International,\napproximately 70% –80% of new mothers experience negative\nfeelings after giving birth (13). For certain demographic groups\nthis is higher, for example, up to 60% for adolescent mothers\nwith a low income (14, 15). Depression during pregnancy and\nthe postpartum period is associated with multiple poor outcomes\nfor parental well-being and childhood development (7, 16–18).\nMaternal mental health is a global public health and economic\nchallenge (19–22). The estimated accumulated national economic\ncost of perinatal depression and anxiety in the UK is £6.6 billion (11).\nWhile treatments for maternal mental health care exist, research\nsuggests that implementation can be challenging and variable (23).\nTechnology could play a signiﬁcant role in addressing barriers\nto care for maternal mental health (24, 25). The acceptability,\nfeasibility and effectiveness of perinatal depression digital\ninterventions have been evaluated in various pilot studies,\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (26–\n36). While maternal mental health digital technology could help\nimprove accessibility, offer timely psychosocial support, as well as\npotentially improve the quality of information being collected,\nmuch more research is needed in this area to carefully examine\nits potential bene ﬁts vs. its limitations ( 37). A study that\npublished recommendations based on user feedback to inform\nfuture development of digital maternal mental health support\nincluded the proposal of adding an Arti ﬁcial Intelligence (AI)\nchatbot ( 38). Using dialogue-led personalized tools, AI-based\nConversational agents (CAs; chatbots) could potentially facilitate\neffective and safe guided conversations and collect information\nbeyond limited survey questions and self-guided sessions.\nAI systems using CA have already been developed to provide\nmedical information to support child physical health for new\nmothers (39–41). In more recent years, proposals have emerged\non how AI could play a distinctive digital role in supporting\nmaternal mental health and wellbeing (42). A clinical trial that\nrandomized women during their birth hospitalization to either\n“chatbot plus treatment as usual” or “treatment as usual” (TAU)\nreported that many participants used the chatbot at least once\nevery 2 weeks and that most users reported medium or high\nsatisfaction with the CA AI system ( 43). The authors also\nreported that most participants reported medium or high degrees\nof therapeutic alliance and acceptability ( 43). Related to these\nﬁndings, an additional RCT publication evaluated the\neffectiveness of the automated CA on changes in symptoms of\nanxiety and depression. The authors reported that at the 6-week\npostpartum follow-up there were no statistically signiﬁcant group\ndifferences between the “chatbot use” or “TAU” (44). A later\nrelated publication reported that the CA intervention group\n(“WB001+ TAU ”) had a signi ﬁcant reduction in depression\nscores as compared to a TAU-only control group 6-week\npostpartum after birth hospitalization (45).\nA pre-pilot development and usability study examining an AI\nsystem involving a cohort of enrolled Kenyan pregnant women\nand new mothers reported that most women submitted at least\nthree mood ratings, sent at least one message to the AI system\nand that approximately a third of women engaged beyond\nregistration (46). Most AI users reported a positive attitude and\nhaving trust in using the AI system and that life changes were\nattributed to using it and reported an estimate that using the\nalpha version of the AI system may have improved mood (46).\nA different approach using a supervised machine learning CA\nfor perinatal mental healthcare was proposed by authors that could\nbe an effective approach for monitoring the mental health status of\nperinatal women in real time while collecting user health data. The\nauthors analyzed the 31 characteristics of 223 samples and trained\na supervised machine learning model to determine the anxiety,\ndepression, and hypomania index of perinatal women (47).\nWhile this literature shows some degree of initial promise, much\nmore research is required to determine how CA AI systems can safely\nsupport maternal mental health and hence the motivation to\nperform our study as a contribution toward furthering the\nunderstanding AI’s potential role in maternal mental health.\nIn our study, we examine the use of an AI-based emotionally\nintelligent mobile app (“Wysa”) aimed at building mental resilience\nand promoting mental well-being using a text-based CA. Previous\nstudies evaluating Wysa have shown signi ﬁcant reductions in\ndepressive symptoms (48–50). The conversation-based tools and\ntechniques encourage users to manage their anxiety, energy, focus,\nsleep, relaxation, loss, worries, conﬂicts, and other concerns. Wysa\nresponds to emotions that a user expresses and recommends\nevidence-based self-help tools and techniques such as Cognitive\nBehavioural Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment\nTherapy (ACT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), motivational\ninterviewing, positive behavior support, behavioral reinforcement,\nmindfulness, and guided micro actions that encourage users to\nbuild emotional resilience skills.\nOur study has two objectives: (1) To examine the effectiveness of\nWysa by comparing changes in self-reported depressive symptoms\nbetween higher vs. lower engaged groups (n = 51) involving users\nthat self-reported a maternal event, and (2) To perform a\nqualitative analysis to understand the themes being raised for a\nsubset of user messages provided by higher engaged users (n =1 0 ) .\nThis study also discusses post hoc observations, clinical\nimplications, and other research implications derived from our study.\nMethods\nStudy design and participants\nThe study duration occurred between February and September,\n2019 (pre-pandemic). The participants were initially selected from\nInkster et al. 10.3389/fgwh.2023.1084302\nFrontiers inGlobal Women’s Health 02 frontiersin.org\na pool of real-world users (N = 380,500 users) who used the Wysa\napp during the study period and who submitted any of the\nmaternal event keywords during their conversation with the CA\n(n = 5,373). Individuals reported at least once about an ongoing\nmaternal event in response to one of these messages: (1) “Tell\nme about any recent major changes or events in your life. It\ncould be something stressful or even a good change like moving\nhome or getting a new job.”, (2) “Take a few deep breaths. Tell\nme the ﬁrst thought on your mind? ”, (3) “I’m here for you.\nWhat exactly happened?” (4) “Okay let’s talk about that. Go on”,\n(5) “I understand. Is there more?”. Multiple example screenshots\nof the Wysa app that match the time period of this study can be\nfound in Supplementary Material S1.\nA subgroup ofN = 2,037 users (2,037 out of 5,373 active users\nmentioned above) were then grouped into four maternal event\ncategories: Pre-pregnancy, Pregnancy, Perinatal, and Postpartum,\nwhich are deﬁned in Table 1. This categorization was used by\nthe researcher for the thematic qualitative analysis (testing\nObjective 2) to assist in making observations that were\ncategorised into the different maternal event stages (pre-\npregnancy and pre-conception, pregnancy, perinatal,\npostpartum). Furthermore, eligibility (inclusion and exclusion)\ncriteria was applied to determine user enrolment into the study,\nwhich is listed in Table 2 and Supplementary Multimedia\nAppendix A, the latter of which shows the sampling method\nused for this study.\nA ﬁnal sample ofn = 10 users were included in the qualitative\nanalysis. The selection method used a non-probability-based\nsampling to select 10 users who had an engagement density of\ngreater than 75%. Furthermore, after additional eligibility\nscreening was applied based on the criteria of completing the\nmental health self-reported depressive symptoms assessment\nquestionnaire at two time points (de ﬁned below in the Data\nAnalysis Section “Effectiveness Analysis” section) a ﬁnal sample\nsize of n = 51 users were included in the Effectiveness Analysis\n(testing Objective 1 using a statistical analysis approach).\nInstruments (measures)\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was used to\nmeasure self-reported depressive symptoms at baseline and\nfollow-up. This validated self-report questionnaire (51) consists\nof nine DSM-IV criteria (i.e., questions) and the participant\nanswers (i.e., scores) each of those on a scale from 0 to 3 (“0” =\nnot at all,“1” = several days,“2” = more than half the days,“3” =\nnearly every day), whereby the severity of depression is measured\non the ﬁnal score aggregated across the questions and range from\n0 to 27 points. It is interpreted using these cut-off points:\nScoring between 0 and 4 points indicates minimal depression, 5\nand 9 points indicates mild depression, 10 and 14 points\nindicates moderate depression, 15 and 19 points indicates\nmoderately severe depression, and 20 or more points indicates\nsevere depression. The PHQ-9 assessments were voluntary, and\nusers were notiﬁed once every two weeks.\nData collection\nThe app repository was queried for a predeﬁned set of maternal\nevent keywords (Table 3).\nCertain keywords were excluded that were considered to induce\nmany false positives within the data (e.g., “born” outside of a\nmaternal-related context, such as “I wish I was never born ”).\nMessages (“user records”) with included keywords were extracted\nalong with the user ’s app engagement information. The user\nrecords were cleared for any inadvertently submitted Personal\nIdentiﬁable Information (PII) using Wysa ’s proprietary PII\ndetection and redaction algorithm. The de-identiﬁed user records\nwere tagged manually for the maternal event categories. The user\nrecords were also tagged for gender:“Female”,o r “Male” or “No\nTag Available” when gender-related information was not available.\nData analysis\nA mixed-methods quantitative and qualitative approach was\nused to evaluate our two study objectives on ef ﬁcacy and\nengagement, respectively.\nTABLE 1 Users were grouped into the following categories based on their\nself-reported maternal events.\nMaternal event\ncategories\nDescription\nPre-Pregnancy or\nPre-Conception\nPeriod prior to conceiving or pregnancy\nPregnancy Period up-to 22 weeks of pregnancy\nPerinatal Period from 22 weeks of pregnancy until ﬁrst month\nof childbirth\nPostpartum Period >1 month to ≤1 year post childbirth\nTABLE 2 The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were deﬁned to\ndetermine participant eligibility.\nInclusion criteria Exclusion criteria\n Self-reported maternal event\n Female users\n Android and iOS smartphone users\n Wysa app usage during study period\n(start-and-end dates inclusive)\n Users who were tagged as male\n Users who were tagged as gender\nambiguous\n Users who talked about maternal-\nevent of a third party\n Users whose records indicated more\nthan one year after child birth\nTABLE 3 The following inclusion and exclusion criteria for maternal event\nkeywords were used to query the app repository for relevant user records\nevent keywords.\nKeywords included Keywords excluded\n*partum* OR ppd OR preg* OR natal\nOR *birth OR miscar* OR delivery OR\nmatern* OR patern* OR birthing OR\nparturition OR ivf OR *fertil* OR doula\nOR epidur* OR“water break” OR “water\nbroke” OR abort* OR“mid wife” OR\nmidwife\n*baby* OR child* OR labor OR labor\nOR mum OR mom OR mother* OR\n*born\nInkster et al. 10.3389/fgwh.2023.1084302\nFrontiers inGlobal Women’s Health 03 frontiersin.org\nEffectiveness analysis (objective 1)\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to\nmeasure self-reported depressive symptoms at two time points.\nThe sample size was comprised of 51 users who completed the\nPHQ-9 at least two weeks apart but not more than 5 weeks\napart, and scored more than 3 in the PHQ-2 (the ﬁrst 2\nquestions of the PHQ-9) (51). The self-reported PHQ-2 cut-off\nwas set at >3 (minimum of 4, maximum of 6). The Self-Reported\nPHQ-9 was set at greater or equal to 5 (minimum of 5,\nmaximum of 27, overall PHQ-9 score of 27; see Instruments\nmeasures section for more context).\nTwo comparison groups were identi ﬁed: (1) a higher\nengaged user group ( nh = 28) and (2) a lower engaged user\ngroup ( nl = 23), based on the number of “session-days ” (the\ndays the users engaged with the CA between the two PHQ-9\nscreening days).\n“Engagement density” is a normalized measure calculated for\neach user deﬁned as the number of active session-days with the\nCA in-between the two PHQ-9 assessments divided by the\navailable days between the two screenings. Users whose\nengagement density was ≥0.4 were grouped as “higher engaged\ngroup” and those with engagement density <0.4 were grouped as\n“lower engaged group”. A 40% engagement density translated to\n14 active days of AI-enabled CA sessions over a 35-day period.\nThe average change in depressive symptoms ( ﬁrst PHQ-9\nassessment score minus the second PHQ-9 assessment score) was\ncompared between the higher vs. lower engagement groups. A\ntwo-tailed, 5% signiﬁcance Mann–Whitney test was used to test\nthe statistical signiﬁcance of the difference in average change of\nsymptoms between the two groups. The effect size was measured\nusing the nonparametric common language effect size (CL)\n(52, 53).\nWe further examined the data related to objective 1 to assess\nthe clinically meaningful impact from the quantitative results\nusing the categories deﬁned by the PHQ-9 to discuss the clinical\nimplications.\nFurthermore, a post hoc analysis was performed to explore\nchanges in the severity thresholds between the two comparison\ngroups across increasing PHQ-9 severity (at ≥10, 15 and 20\nintervals). Depressive symptom reductions were measured for\nstatistical signiﬁcance (M–W test) and effect size (CL) but not\nconsidered as actually signiﬁcant due to the exploratory,post hoc\nnature and lack of correction for multiple testing.\nEngagement analysis (objective 2)\nA qualitative analysis examined behaviors exhibited by a subset\nof higher engaged users with maternal events based on their\nconversations with Wysa. A Braun and Clarke thematic analysis\n(54, 55) was performed on free-text responses from users (n =\n10) who had an engagement density of greater than 75% based\non their conversations (i.e., an anonymized sample of 216 free-\ntext conversational snippets) with the AI CA. The main themes\nand subthemes, derived from the coding and analysis, helped\nunderstand users ’ expectations, experience and engagement.\nPrevalence of a theme was measured based on number of\ninstances and number of responding users.\nEthics\nWysa is publicly available as a mobile application (android and\niOS). The Conversational Agent (CA) is freely available and has\nbeen designed to prioritize safety, privacy and security-by-design.\nNo user registration is required and no Personal Identi ﬁable\nInformation (PII) is asked for during app use. This provides\nusers a private, anonymous space encouraging them to manage\ntheir mental well-being in a self-help context (56). All content\nand tools within the app are reviewed and validated by the Wysa\nclinical and safety teams. As the study involved analyzing real-\nworld data from an anonymous nonclinical population, it was\nexempt from registration in a public trial registry (according to\nOHRP guidelines). Users voluntarily downloaded the app after\nhaving consented to the app Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n(57, 58). For ethical and privacy reasons, the authors did not\nhave access to all the user messages. Only minimal and limited\nconversation data at speci ﬁc chat endpoints were used. The\ndataset was anonymised by redacting any inadvertent identiﬁers.\nUser data was adequately secured according to the organization’s\nprivacy, security and safety policies. The organization ’s\ncompliance and privacy ofﬁcer is author VS who audited the\nstudy dataset for safety, privacy and security compliance prior to\nresearch use.\nResults\nEffectiveness analysis (objective 1)\nThe effectiveness statistical analysis was performed to test for\ngroup level differences in depressive symptom scoring between\nhigh vs. low engagement group of users. The statistical analysis\nrevealed that the high engaged user group showed a signiﬁcant\ndepressive symptom reduction compared with the lower engaged\nuser group (p = .004) [Figure 1, also refer to Table 4 for more\ninformation including a breakdown of PHQ-9 score averages and\nstandard deviations (SD) for each group pre and post\ntimepoints]. The effect size was high (large) (0.736) (also see\nTable 4), which is roughly equivalent to a high Cohen d (0.89)\n(52, 53). There was no statistical difference in average PHQ-9\nbaseline scores between the higher and lower engaged groups.\nThe high engagement group at baseline had a PHQ-9 minimum\nof 6 and a maximum of 24 and at follow-up had a PHQ-9\nminimum of 6 and a maximum of 27. The low engagement\ngroup at baseline had a PHQ-9 minimum of 9 and a maximum\nof 24 and at follow-up had a PHQ-9 minimum of 9 and a\nmaximum of 27.\nThe decrease in PHQ-9 score for the higher engagement group\nwas indicative of a shift in clinical improvement from“moderately\nInkster et al. 10.3389/fgwh.2023.1084302\nFrontiers inGlobal Women’s Health 04 frontiersin.org\nsevere” depression at baseline into the “moderate depression”\ncategory at follow-up (refer to Methods Section about PHQ-9\nscoring assessment procedures). There was no clinical shift\nbetween scoring categories for the lower engagement group and\nat both time points the lower engagement group average PHQ-9\nscores remained within the“moderately severe depression” range.\nPost hocquantitative analysis\nAs a post hoc analysis, we explored depressive symptom\nreductions between the groups across increasing PHQ-9 severity.\nSigniﬁcant reductions were found among higher engaged users\ncompared to lower engaged users as the severity increased in that\nthe effect was stronger for higher PHQ-9 scoring category\nthresholds indicating the effect was stronger for more severe\ndepression. Depressive symptom reductions were seen with large\neffect sizes (0.735–0.883) at PHQ-9 ≥ 10, 15 and 20 intervals as\ncan be seen inFigure 2.\nEngagement analysis (objective 2)\nWe report results derived from qualitative insights into the\nbehaviors exhibited among higher engaged maternal event users\n(n = 10; engagement density <75%) based on their conversations\n(an anonymized sample of 216 free-text conversational snippets)\nwith the AI CA. Five main behavioral themes emerged: (1)\nConcern, (2) Support, (3) Reframe, (4) Hope, and (5) Victory.\nMore detailed information about these themes is reported in\nTable 5. For the thematic maps of themes and sub-themes, and\nuser messages, please refer to Supplementary Multimedia\nAppendix B. In brief, some users used the app to explore and\nexpress their feelings or concerns, or were more critical of\nthemselves or others, or actively and repeatedly used sleep,\nrelaxation and anxiety related tools or techniques to manage\ntheir emotional states, or users completed CBT and reframed\ntheir negative thoughts as they shared their small victories and\ngratitudes during their self-created personalized self-help journey.\nFIGURE 1\nBar plot illustrating a signiﬁcant reduction in symptoms of self-reported depressive symptoms amongst the higher engaged user group compared to the\nlower engaged user group.\nTABLE 4 The high engaged user group showed a signiﬁcant reduction in depressive symptoms compared with the lower engaged users group\n(p = 0.004).\nUsers with self-reported PHQ-\n2a > 3 & PHQ-9 > 5\nNumber of\nusers (N)\nFirst PHQ 9\nscore (SD)\nSecond PHQ 9\nscore (SD)\nMean\ndifference\nMann–Whitney U\n(p valuec)\nEffect size\n(CL)b\nHigher engaged users (nh) 28 15.8 (6.0) 13.8 (5.4) 2.00 170 (0.004) 0.736\nLower engaged users (nl) 23 16.2 (4.2) 17.7 (4.6) −1.50 ––\naPHQ-2, Patient Health Questionnaire-2.\nbCL, common language effect size.\nc95% signiﬁcance.\nInkster et al. 10.3389/fgwh.2023.1084302\nFrontiers inGlobal Women’s Health 05 frontiersin.org\nNotably, none of the users sought help from the CA about their\nmaternal health related matters. This was not an identiﬁed theme\nor sub-theme.\nAdditional qualitative observations\nThese users also provided feedback on sessions within the app\nwith overall sessions seeing 97% of users with high or mid-\nsatisfaction. The user’s geographical zone location was derived\nfrom the zone related to their smartphone. Participants were\nmainly located in North America, with a small minority located\nin Europe. Relationship status was inferred from conversation\nsnippets, which showed that most of the participants (50%) were\nsingle and only 10% were married.\nStressors experienced by the users were also identiﬁed with key\nconcerns being about relationships (100% of users, included\nmarriage, parents, trauma, break-ups), ﬁnancial distress (60% of\nusers, included worries about savings and money), work (20% of\nusers, work-life balance, coworker discomfort), life (30% of users,\nincluding feelings of loneliness, worthlessness, disinterest), and\nphysical health (10% of users, included chronic illness).\nDiscussion\nTechnology’s role in supporting mental health and wellbeing is\nincreasingly evidenced. Our study adds to this literature showing\nhow an AI-enabled CA can offer emotional support for maternal\nmental health and wellbeing. Given evidence that maternal\ndepressive symptoms have increased during the COVID-19\npandemic (59, 60) our pre-covid study is important and requires\nfollow-up to validate our preliminaryﬁndings.\nFIGURE 2\nPost hocanalysis showing signiﬁcant reductions in depressive symptoms among higher engaged users compared to lower engaged users across multiple\nPHQ-9 severity cut-off thresholds.\nTABLE 5 Five main behavioral themes emerged from the qualitative\nanalyses of free-text responses from higher engagement AI users.\nThemes Subthemes\n“Concern” This theme brings out the user’s emotional state as they share their\nissues, worries, negative thoughts and emotions. Users mentioned\nmultiple life stressors, for example, expressing fear about an underlying\nhealth condition or fear of getting pregnant or generally fearful of\nthings going around them. Users were often found to be self-critical\nand expressed an underlying anguish or frustration over their\nrelationship, work-life challenges or their emotional situation.\n“Support” This theme captures instances where users came looking for well-being\nsupport. It also included those who expressed their frustration for the\nlack of support available outside and how they appreciated the CA for\nthe support provided. User messages highlighted a continuous search\nto ﬁnd support mechanisms, to seek love and understanding, to seek\nhelp for managing emotions and leading their day-to-day life.\n“Reframe” The most used CBT technique was reframing thoughts. Reframing\nhelps the user to use CBT techniques to consider their thoughts from a\ndifferent perspective and then to replay it to reinforce it. Users also\nidentiﬁed and expressed possible solutions that they could work on to\nmanage their issues. Some users used the CA to frame messages that\nthey wanted to convey and to confront their relationship challenges.\n“Hope” Users found comfort in sharing their hopes and intentions about their\nwell-being. They expressed hope to achieve some of their objectives. In\nthe process they expressed goals for themselves and also that involved\nothers.\n“Victory” Users motivated themselves to take control and action. They also\nshared their sense of achievement and positive activities. Users\nexpressed their gratitude about key events, for tasks undertaken, about\nthose close to them, about their well-being and including objects/tools.\nInkster et al. 10.3389/fgwh.2023.1084302\nFrontiers inGlobal Women’s Health 06 frontiersin.org\nPrincipal ﬁndings\nThis study evaluated the effectiveness of an AI-enabled CA-\nbased mental health and wellbeing app on reducing depressive\nsymptoms for users who reported maternal events. We found a\nsigniﬁcant reduction in self-reported depressive symptoms among\nthe higher engaged user group compared to the lower engaged\nuser group with a high effect size. This reduction in PHQ-9\nscore for the higher engaged group was indicative of a shift in\nclinical improvement from “moderately severe depression ” to\n“moderate depression” at follow-up. A post hoc analysis showed\nthat reductions in depressive symptoms were observed across all\nPHQ-9 severity score thresholds for the higher engaged group,\nwith an observed increasing effect size as severity of symptoms\nincreased.\nThis study also performed a qualitative analysis to examine\nuser engagement, which revealed ﬁve thematic behaviors:\nConcern, Support, Reframe, Hope and Victory. Some users used\nthe app to explore and express their feelings or concerns. Some\nwere more critical of themselves or others. Some users actively\nand repeatedly used sleep, relaxation and anxiety related tools or\ntechniques to manage their emotional states. Some users\ncompleted CBT and reframed their negative thoughts as they\nshared their small victories and gratitudes during their self-\ncreated personalized self-help journey.\nNone of the users asked for support for their maternal event or\nmaternal health matters. Instead, users messaged and engaged with\nthe CA about their emotions and the stressors they were\nexperiencing. This could suggest that users were aware of the\nintended purpose of the well-being app. The overall in-app\nfeedback indicated comfort of using a digital mental health and\nwellbeing CA for support.\nComparison with existing literature\nWe compared ourﬁndings with the existing literature focusing\non publications that assessed the effectiveness of using CA AI\nsystems for reducing maternal mental health depressive\nsymptoms. Two publications of this type were identiﬁed (as this\nis a nascent research area).\nAn RCT study (44) was identiﬁed that evaluated the effect of an\nautomated CA on postpartum mental health using three\nquestionnaires, including the PHQ-9. The authors reported no\nsigniﬁcant difference between the “CA intervention group” and\nthe “treatment as usual (TAU) control group” between baseline\n(after giving birth) and 6 weeks postpartum. That study differed\nfrom our study in multiple ways. Our study used a real-world\nanonymous remote setting approach to enrol users and we\nincluded a wide range of maternal events (pre-pregnancy and\npre-conception, pregnancy, perinatal, postpartum) whereas the\nRCT study (44) took place in hospital settings with stringent\nrecruitment eligibility criteria. The studies also differ by control\ngroup criteria, study durations, sample size, and differing PHQ-9\ncut-off thresholds. The RCT reported low baseline PHQ-9 mean\nscores (intervention and control group average PHQ-9 scores of\n4.6 and 3.3, respectively) and similarly low at 6-week follow-up\n(intervention and control groups, 3.1 and 3.1, respectively)\nwhereas our study showed much higher group mean PHQ-9\nscores (Table 4). It could be possible that differences in study\ndesigns, PHQ-9 score severity, and durations of questionnaire\nassessments are, in part, explaining differences in statistical\nﬁndings.\nAnother RCT (45) [which might be closely related to the other\nRCT (44)] evaluated an automated CA on postpartum mental\nhealth using two mental health questionnaires, including the\nPHQ-9, and reported that the CA intervention group (“WB001+\nTAU participants”) had a statistically signi ﬁcant reduction in\ndepressive symptom scores compared to the TAU-only control\ngroup between baseline after giving birth and 6 weeks\npostpartum (45). The RCT reported similarly low PHQ-9 mean\nscores at baseline and 6-week follow-up (scores below 5). It is\nnot possible to compare our studyﬁndings with this publication\n(45), however, as the methodology used is not described.\nTo our knowledge these two maternal mental health\npublications are the only literature currently available for direct\ncomparison of statistical ﬁndings on CA AI system effectiveness\nusing the PHQ-9 to assess changes in depressive symptoms. We\nwere unable to compare efﬁcacy with a third study (46) as that\npre-pilot study did not include two timepoints for the PHQ-9 for\nvarious reasons. For example, the depression screening was too\nlong to administer on a repeating basis, the researchers wanted\nto avoid frustrating users and distracting them from potential\nengagement with the intervention (46).\nClinical implications\nFor the higher engagement group, the statistically signiﬁcant\ndecrease in PHQ-9 score was indicative of a clinical shift from\n“moderately severe depression” at baseline into the “moderate\ndepression” category at follow-up. In contrast, for the lower\nengagement group there was no clinical shift between depressive\nsymptom categories (it remained as “moderately severe\ndepression”). If the higher engagement group used Wysa for a\nlonger duration than two weeks it could be hypothesized that\nthis would further reduce symptomology bringing users “below\ncaseness”, which is deﬁned by NHS IAPT services as being in\neither “minimal” (PHQ9 score of 0–4) or “mild” (PHQ9 score of\n5–9) categories (61).\nOur post hoc observations showing a reduction in depressive\nsymptoms across all PHQ-9 severity score thresholds for the\nhigher engaged group supports a prior meta-analysis, which\nshowed that patients with more severe depression at baseline had\nat least as much clinical beneﬁt from low intensity interventions\nas less severely depressed patients, inferring that low intensity\ninterventions could be offered to more severe symptom groups\n(62).\nIn clinical settings, AI-enabled CA agents could potentially\nenhance health information systems to capture the right\nmeasurements at the right time and offer the right support in a\nInkster et al. 10.3389/fgwh.2023.1084302\nFrontiers inGlobal Women’s Health 07 frontiersin.org\ntimely manner, which could help to alleviate the burden of data\ncollection by health-care workers in healthcare settings (63). This\ntechnology could also potentially support early detection given\nthat many postnatal depression cases are undiagnosed ( 30).\nThis is important in low-and mi ddle-income countries (given\nthe lack of trained professionals); however, even in countries\nwhere trained professionals are more readily available\ncommunication gaps in identifying concerns remain an issue\n(64), which is where an AI-enabled CA agent facilitate better\ncommunication.\nThere is much potential for using CA-based support for\nmaternal mental health and wellbeing, but this will require more\nin-depth research and must ensure that safety and privacy\nprotects users, especially given ongoing global events related to\nreproductive justice (65) and the role of technology companies\n(66). The mental health and wellbeing CA examined in our study\nprioritizes privacy and security by design and default. Two recent\nMozilla Foundation reports found that reproductive health apps\n(67) and most digital mental health and wellbeing apps ( 68)\ninvestigated were problematic in terms of data protection and\nprivacy with their report showing that Wysa was only 1 of 2\ndigital mental health and wellbeing apps to pass their privacy\ninvestigation (68).\nIn terms of generalizability, users came from 150 global time\nzones and both android and iOS versions of the app were used.\nFurthermore, this study included individuals who self-reported\nexperiencing a wide range of maternal events that had an impact\non their mental health and wellbeing. This helps to highlight the\nimportance of offering AI-enabled CA support to wider\ndemographics who need emotional support for different reasons\nwith different needs and preferences (48–50).\nThis study has several limitations. As RCTs are typically\nregarded as the “gold standard” for evaluating the ef ﬁcacy of\ninterventions, a lack of controlled settings could lead to non-\nhandling of biases. Our study has no way of knowing whether\ndemographics were balanced across groups (e.g., diagnoses, other\npsychological support they might have sought, etc. could impact\nthe analysis). While the PHQ-9 scores are indicative of\ndepressive symptomatology, scores do not conﬁrm or refute the\npresence of depression. Our study only collected PHQ-9 scores\nfrom two time points close together and was not able to follow-\nup on later outcomes. It did not use other assessments such as\nEPDS, which could be more appropriate to check concordance\nand discordance ( 69). This study used small, unbalanced\ncomparison groups with no use of a treatment-as-usual control\ngroup. Users had voluntarily used the app and were likely to\nhave high readiness to explore self-care tools. There may be\nhuman bias in labeling data for analysis, such as gender\nambiguity, given the app doesn ’t capture gender for privacy\nreasons.\nOverall, this study demonstrates that an AI-enabled CA-based\nsupport can play an important role in reducing depressive\nsymptoms and offering support across diverse maternal events. It\nadds to a nascent yet growing literature demonstrating the\nacceptability and comfort of using AI-enabled CA-based digital\nmental health and wellbeing apps for emotional support.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\nmade available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nEthics statement\nWysa is publicly available as a mobile application (android and\niOS).
