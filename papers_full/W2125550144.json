    "abstract": "The monitoring of different types of pollutants that are released into the environment and that present risks for both humans and wildlife has become increasingly important. In this study, we examined whether feathers of predatory birds can be used as a non-destructive biomonitor of organic pollutants. We demonstrate that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are measurable in one single tail feather of common buzzards ( Buteo buteo ) and that levels in this feather and internal tissues are significantly related to each other (0.35&lt; r &lt;0.76 for all 43 buzzards; 0.46&lt; r &lt;0.84 when excluding 17 starved birds). Our findings provide the first indication that feathers of predatory birds could be useful in non-destructive biomonitoring of organic pollutants, although further validation may be necessary.",
