INTRODUCTION  \nOne of the advantages of using high temperature superconducting (HTS) transformers, in addition to \nhigh values of permissible current density per winding wire cross -section, is the capability of short circuit \ncurrent limitation under fault co nditions. An additional advantage of HTS transformers is fire and explosion \nsafety. It is determined by the replacement of transformer oil, the main insulating material for windings, for \nliquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen is a dielectric having electric brea kdown intensity of 20 kV/mm2 at 77 K that \nis similar to characteristics of transformer oil under normal conditions.  \n Physical and mathematical verification of the capability for short circuit current limitation in \nelectrical networks with HTS transformers  will be considered in next sections. Superconducting windings \nhave a special property: when current exceeds a specified critical value, it develops a critical value for \nmagnetic field in a superconducting wire, then a wire losses superconducting propertie s and passes into the \nresistive state. Such transition is followed by transient processes that features should be considered when \ndesigning and operating HTS transformers [1], [2]. \n                ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 8, No. 1, February 2018 :  505 – 512 \n506 \nWhen current flowing through a HTS transformer winding exceeds the critical  current I K(T) \ndetermined by a wire type, a radial component of an electromagnetic field, a value of flowing current, and \ntemperature, then a HTS wire may pass from the superconducting state into the normal state at the normal \ntemperature. In this case, th e resistance of a superconducting layer in a wire increases considerably, then a \nflowing current is forced into other layers of a HTS wire. As a cross -section of these layers is not sufficient \nfor current flowing, a resistance of this cross -section increases considerably that leads to short circuit current \nlimitation. The main parameters of a current -limiting winding are the following: the value of current to be \nlimited, short circuit duration without winding damages, and permissible temperature rise.  \nConsider short circuit current limitation with the use of transformers having HTS windings with the \nfollowing assumptions [2]: a HTS wire passes from the superconducting state into the normal state uniformly \nalong the wire length; all network elements, except a limiting resistance, are linear. \n \n \n2. PROBLEM STATEMENT \nHigh temperature superconducting wires are nonideal  superconductors of the second order. It means \nthat the transition from a superconducting state into the normal state takes some time through an intermediate \nmixed state when a magnetic field does not fully penetrate into a superconductor ( superconductor i s a \ndiamagnetic and stops a magnetic field from penetrating ). A mixed state exists in the range from the first \ncritical current IK1 to the second critical current IK2. Under this state, current flows simultaneously through \nboth a superconducting layer, and nonsuperconducting layers [3-5]. In this case, a resistance of a HTS wire is \ndetermined by an equivalent resistance of a superconducting layer and nonsuperconducting layers as parallel \nelements. \n \n     \n   \n*,, ,\nNSC SC\nN\nEq\nSCSC\nR T R I TR I T R T R I T \n,       (1) \n \nwhere RNSC – resistance of nonsuperconducting layers of a winding wire; RSC – resistance of a \nsuperconducting layer of a winding wire; I – operating current through a wire; T – temperature of a wire. \nThe resistance of a superconducting layer can be determined from t he current-voltage characteristic \nof a HTS material as shown in Figure 1. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.

It is possible to occur at short \ncircuit currents not interrupted for a long time that results in overheating of HTS winding wires with the loss \nof superconductivity and all its advantages. \nIt is considered that a HTS wire passes into the normal state when voltage of one microvolt occurs \nalong a wire of one centimeter length. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.

PROPOSED METHOD AND ANALYSES \nTo facilitate conditions for returning a conductor into the superconducting state under no -current \nconditions or load conditions, it is necessary to determine the quantity of heat which is released during short \ncircuit current flowing before interruption. For this purpose, the program was developed in MATLAB with \nthe following assumption: short circuit occurs at the outgoing feeder of the 40 MVA HTS transformer with \nshort circuit clearing after 0.1 s without transformer disconnection.  \nThis paper proposes the use of a hybrid winding for short circuit current limitation where only a part \nof turns is used for limitation. It can be achieved by the use of various wires with different parameters. In this \ncase, a non -current-limiting part has a low resistance in t he normal state, while a current -limiting part has a \nhigh resistance for short circuit current limitation. \nSuch construction of the HTS transformer winding allows the combination of two elements of \nelectrical networks, transformer and reactor, connected in  series in one device having functions of both \nvoltage transformation and short circuit current limitation. \nWith known REq(I, T), a wire length in a current-limiting part of the winding can be found. \n \nlim\n( , )\nhw\nW\nEq\nR n nL R I T\n,         (6) \n \nwhere Rlim – required resistance for short circuit current limitation; nh and nw – the number of layers in height \nand in width respectively. \n\n                ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 8, No. 1, February 2018 :  505 – 512 \n508 \nFigure 3 shows the cross-sectional view of the HTS transformer. \n \n \n \nFigure 3.

Curves of the short circuit current without (1) and with (2) limitation  \n \n \nThe most significant aspect with short circuit current limitation is the determination of time for  \nreturn of a HTS transformer winding into the initial superconducting state. To find this time, it is necessary to \ncalculate the quantity of heat released in a wire during dead -time of automatic reclosing.

As a result, the nonsteady -state \nequation of thermal conductivity wa s obtained that describes the temperature change of the current -limiting \npart of the winding depending on the short circuit current flowing through the winding and time before short \ncircuit clearing by relay protection in the power system: \n \n00\n( , )( ) ( ) ()\nQ I T WT t T T t T CT\n   \n,      (13) \n \nwhere T0 – initial temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K). \nTherefore, the general mathematical model can be developed that allows determining the quantity of \nheat and winding heating to establish requirements to short circuit current  limitation with the use of a \ntransformer with HTS windings.

In other words, the r atio between the short circuit current and the load current should be a \nsuch value that the quantity of heat does not exceed the critical value during a short circuit. Other approaches \nare also possible. When the ratio is exceeded, a transformer should be disconnected to return the winding into \nthe superconducting state. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8.

ADVANTAGES OF HTS TRANSFORMERS \nSumming up the above-mentioned aspects of the construction and regimes of HTS transformers, it is \npossible to estimate some technological and ecological advantages of these transformers in comparison with \ntraditional high-voltage oil transformers. The advantages are the following: \na. decrease of load (dynamic) losses of active power in HTS transformer windings by more than 90% at the \nrated load current that increases transformer efficiency up to 99% and significantly enhances its energy \nefficiency; \nb. decrease of overall dimensi ons and weight of a HTS transformer by up to 40%. Consequently, it is \npossible to use these transformers at existing substations without structural changes and widening the area \nof installation, but with significant increase of a transformer power; \nc. short circuit current limitation due to transition of a winding, or windings, depending on a short circuit \ntype, into the normal state that facilitates electromagnetic processes for switching equipment in electrical \nnetworks; \nd. high overload capability of HTS trans formers allows withstanding double overloads in 48 hours without \ninsulation damages and deterioration that does not reduce transformer lifetime [19];  \ne. fire and explosion safety of HTS transformers due to the lack of oil insulation that enhances ecological \ncompatibility; \nf. reduction of noise that increases convenience of HTS transformer arrangement and maintenance;  \ng. extremely low no -load losses and short circuit losses that significantly depends on allocation and \nconstruction of a HTS transformer magnetic core: “warm” (outside a cryostat) and “cold” (inside a \ncryostat). In this case, a “warm” magnetic core allows using relatively cheap thin -sheet electrical steel \nwith a magnetic induction of up to 1.6 T. A “cold” magnetic core makes a cryostat construction simple r \nwith considerable reduction of core dimensions, however increasing energy consumption for cooling a \nlittle. If using amorphous steels or alloys, a released heat equals up to 0.35 W/kg at 1.7T and 50 Hz \ninstead of 0.8 W/kg; \nh. maintenance costs of HTS transformers during a lifetime period are lower by one half in comparison with \ntraditional oil transformers (according to some data, lower by 70%). \n \n \n5. CONCLUSION  \nIt is shown that there is a possibility of short circuit current limitation with the help of a transformer \nwith HTS windings in electrical networks, including a case of using a possible additional winding for this \naim. At the same time, short circuit current limitation is not so considerable in the initial half -cycle as in the \nfollowing half-cycles. It is caused by faster damping of the aperiodic component of short circuit current than \nin traditional transformers with copper windings, and by the temperature rise of a HTS transformer winding.  \nThe return into the superconducting state of a HTS transfor mer winding considerably depends on \nthe ratio between a short circuit current and a rated load current, and on a stabilizer layer thickness in a HTS \nwire. \nLimitation of various short circuit currents using a HTS transformer due to considerable increase of \nwinding resistances with the loss of the superconducting state allows replacing series reactors having high \ninductances and resistances. At the same time, active losses in the electrical network are reduced with the \nincrease of reliability, while technical  and economic performance of power supply systems are improved in \ncomparison with individual series reactors used for short circuit current limitation.  \nIn the authors’ opinion, application and development of HTS -technologies in power engineering \nallows increasing current carrying capacity (i.e. thermal limits) in the power system and transmitting more \npower with the same ratings. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe research was carried out under the State Assignment of the Ministry of Education and Science \nof the Russian Federation, Project 8.6809.2017/8.9. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Sh.I.
