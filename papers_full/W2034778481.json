The main problem about \nFRA techniques is to interpret the observed evolution of the \nfrequency response in order to identify failures. Transformer \nhigh frequency computer modeling is proposed in this work to be \nused with the FRA. The physical meaning of the model \nparameters allows the identification of the problem inside the \ntransformer. The paper presents the model and experimental \nresults and analysis of the frequency responses on the variations \nof the winding parameters. Effect of core, bushings, oil and tank \non FRA is also investigated. \nI. INTRODUCTION  \nower transformers are a vital link in a power system. \nMonitoring and diagnostic techniques are essential to \ndecrease maintenance and improve reliability of the \nequipment. Currently there are several of chemical and \nelectrical diagnostic techniques applied for power \ntransformers[1]. Frequency response analysis (FRA) has been \nsuccessfully used for detecting winding deformation, core and \nclamping structure [2-4]. Deformation results in relative \nchange to the internal inductance and capacitance of the \nwinding structure. These changes can be detected externally by \nFRA method. FRA is an offline test and is used to measure the \ninput/output relationship as a function of frequency (typically \nin the range of 2 MHz). This provides a fingerprint of a \ntransformer and is compared with its previous signatures to \ndetect winding displacement. However, the fingerprints are \nrarely available, especially for transformers in service. Thus \nother information such as comparison between identically \nconstructed transformers has to be taken for diagnosis. For \nlinear systems, the system transfer function is independent of \nthe applied signal and it only depends on the system \nparameters. A transformer represents a nonlinear system and \nits electrical equivalent circuit is very complex network of \ndistributed resistive, capacitive, inductive elements and \nconductance between high voltage and low voltage windings. \nHence, the frequency response of a transformer is dependent \non the formulation of complex series and parallel resonant \ncircuits. FRA with experience based interpretation identifies \ndifferent problems associated with certain frequency bands. \n \nManuscript received September 21, 2007.  \nA. A. Siada and S. Islam are with the Curtin University of Technology, \nPerth Australia (a.abusiada@curtin.edu.au) \nFrequencies scan less than 5 kHz are sensitive to core \ndeformation, open circuits, shorted turns and residual \nmagnetism. The frequencies scan between 10 kHz and 500 \nkHz are sensitive mainly to bulk winding movements. High \nfrequencies scan greater than 750 kHz are sensitive to \nmovement of inter-connections, winding leads, tap-changer \nconnection and if at very high spectrum greater than 1 MHz \nthen even to the external connection of the test cables[5].  \nConventional FRA has been relying on a graphical analysis for \ntransformer diagnosis, which requires trained experts to \ninterpret test results and identify failures. This paper \ninvestigates the FRA in details and presents a general model \nfor the transformer in a broad band of frequencies. The \nphysical meaning of the model parameters allows the \nidentification of the problem inside the transformer.   \n \nII. \nXPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  \nThe FRA was carried out on a 15 MVA 22/0.415 kV power \ntransformer (vector group dY11). The test conditions were oil \nwinding temperature 25ºC, ambient temperature 22ºC and \nrelative humidity 46%. The FRA graph for high and low \nvoltage windings is shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively.  It \ncan be shown from Fig. 1 that in the low frequency range (less \nthan 1 kHz) the response is characterized by resonance at 400 \nand 500 Hz these resonant frequencies corresponding to the \nhalf-wave space harmonics in the winding due to the low \nimpedance terminations of the measuring circuit. Below 1 kHz \nthe transformer winding response is dominated by inductance. \nAs the frequency increases more space harmonics are built up \nin the winding. In the medium frequency range multiple \nresonances can be observed over the entire frequency range. \n \nHigh Frequency Transformer Computer \nModeling \nAhmed A.

Restrictions apply. \n 2 \n \nFig. 1 High Voltage Windings \n \n \nFig. 2 Low Voltage Windings \n \nAt higher frequencies the distributed capacitances in the \ntransformer tends to shunt the winding inductance and \nresonance is much less pronounced. Also winding lead effects \ntend to affect the results in the higher frequency region. The \ncore will likely have some effect at the lower frequencies and \nskin effect will become a factor at higher frequencies.  \nFigure 3 shows the response when the low voltage windings \nare short circuited, the resonant frequencies will appear only in \nthe higher frequency range, while the response in the very low \nfrequency range showing some variation between the blue \nphase and other two phases.  The distortion appears in the high \nfrequency range is most probably caused by the end leads \nassociated with tap-changer leads and bushing tails.  \n \nFig. 3 FRA of HV windings with LV winding shorted \n \nTo show the effect of the core on the FRA, the windings \nhave been removed from the transformer i.e. bushings; core, \noil and tank are removed. Figures 4 and 5 show the FRA of the \nHV and LV winding respectively. The overall response is \nnoticeably altered than those of Figures 1 and 2.  \n \n \nFig. 4 FRA of HV winding with core removed \n \n \nFig. 5 FRA of LV winding with core removed \n \nIt can be seen from Figures 4 and 5 that at low frequency \nrange, losses are much less than the previous case.  This is \nbecause the magnetic circuit of the core determines the \ninductive characteristics in the low frequency range and since \nthe core is removed and the winding inductance is small, the \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

At higher \nfrequencies the distributed capacitances in the transformer will \ndominate and the frequency response will depict more resonant \nfrequencies.  \nTo determine the sensitivity of the FRA method to changes \nin winding inductance, the effect of changing tap position was \nexamined. Figure 6 shows the FRA of the HV winding with \nthe tapping winding open circuit. The effect is noticeable over \nthe whole frequency range.  \nIn the low frequency range the oscillation is most likely to \nbe affected by coil configuration, in the middle range by layer \nand section effects and at higher frequencies by individual \nturns.  Resonance points will appear only in the high frequency \nrange.  In the low frequency range, the out put voltage is zero \nbecause of the shorted turns and the core removal. At higher \nfrequency range, effect of capacitances will be dominate and \nthe output voltage will exist with many resonant points.   \n \n \nFig. 6 FRA of HV winding with tapping winding open circuit \n \nThe effect is more noticeable in the low frequency range (less than 10 kHz) \nover the entire frequency range.   \n \nIII. TRANSFORMER M ODEL  \nThe practical application of any diagnostic technique to \ndetect mechanical damage in a transformer depends on its \nsensitivity to change in the distributed inductance and \ncapacitance. Every transformer has a unique transfer function \nand can be modelled by a string of inductances to earth and \nshunted by their stray capacitances between windings. The \nequivalent circuit is useful in modelling the sensitivity of FRA \nto winding changes. It also can be used for the localization of \npartial discharges. A change in response could be related to a \ncalculated amount of winding deformation.  FRA results can \nbe used to construct models of transformer winding. These \nmodels can be used to relate frequency response data to the \ntransformer mechanical structure and to quantify significant \nwinding changes.  High frequency transformer models are \nbased on lumped circuit approach where elements of \ntransformer including windings, core, etc are represented by \nelectrical parameters that can be measured or calculated. The \nselection of these parameters determines the accuracy of the \nmodel. The influence imposed by the core into the inductance \ncalculations has been discussed by many researchers [6]. \nHowever, all the previous studies have studied this point \ntheoretically. In this work, practical FRA is obtained for the \ntransformer under study with and without the core. A computer \nmodel is proposed for each case. The frequency response of \neach model is compared with the corresponding practical one. \nIn this case, effect of the core can be elaborated in a wide \nrange of frequencies.  \n \n \nFig. 7 Equivalent circuit of HV winding \n \nFigure 7 shows the proposed model of the HV winding only \n(with core and LV winding removed). In the model, R is the \ntotal resistance of the winding, L is the total leakage \ninductance and C represents the winding capacitance to \nground. The transfer function of the circuit shown in Figure 7 \ncan be written as: \nLCSL\nRS\nLC\nV\nV\ni\no\n1\n1\n2 + +\n=  (1) \nOr in the frequency domain: \n\n\n\n\n + −−=⇒\n−\n− ∠\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n −\n= −\n2 22 2\n2\n1\n2\n22\n2\n) ( )1( log 101log 20\n1tan\n1\n1\nωω\nω\nω\nωω\nL\nR\nLCLCV\nV\nLC\nL\nR\nL\nR\nLC\nLC\nV\nV\ndBi\no\ni\no  (2) \n \nHence, it is possible to plot the frequency response of the \ntransfer function along with the frequency response of the \npractical test. In this way, a comparison of the two curves may \nbe made and an assessment made of the degree of accuracy of \nthe derived model.  \nFigure 8 shows a comparison between the frequency \nresponse obtained from the FRA test and the frequency \nresponse of the proposed model. The plot shows a difference \nbetween the experimental and model responses in the low \nfrequency range, this may be attributed to the ignorance of the \ncore effect. In the medium and high frequency range, the \nmodel response is not ideally accurate due to the complex \nshape of the measured frequency response, which depicts a \nnumber of resonant points.  \n \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: CURTIN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

In the model the following \nparameters are in their lumped form and all referred to the \nsecondary side: \n1) an ideal transformer for ratio purposes only. \n2) C\np and Cs represent the primary and secondary winding \ncapacitances to ground respectively. \n3) Lw is the equivalent leakage inductance of the primary and \nsecondary windings. \n4) Zh is the core exciting impedance (resistance and \ninductance in parallel). \nSyed et al.[8] proposed three high frequency transformer \nequivalent circuits by dividing the general model into low, \nmedium and high frequency range models, reflecting \nparameter significance. This paper presents a general high \nfrequency transformer model that can be used for FRA. \n \nThe transfer function of the circuit shown in Fig. 9 can be \nwritten as: \neq w h\nw\nw h w\nw\nh eqeq h w\nw\nw\nw\neq\nps\ni\no\nC L L\nR\nL R L\nR\nL CsC R L\nRs s\nL\nRs sC\nC\nV\nV\n+ + ++ + +\n+\n=\n)11(1)1(\n) (\n2 3\n2\n (3) \nWhere ps p s eqC C C C+ + = \n \nThe design data of the transformer is used to compute the \ninductances and capacitances shown in the above equation[9, \n10].  \n \nIt can be observed from the transfer function and its phase \nplot shown in Fig. 10 that at low frequencies, the influence of \ncapacitance is negligible and the winding behaves as an \ninductor. This is due to the fact that flux penetration of the \ncore is significant and hence Z\nh, the core excitation impedance, \nis included. As the frequency increases, the circuit \ncapacitances dominate.   \n \n \n \nFig. 10 Phase plot of the model TF  \n \n \n \nFig. 11 Transformer actual and model frequency responses \n \nFigure 11 shows the experimental and model frequency \nresponses. At low frequency range, the experimental response \ntends to shift towards left. This may be attributed to the \npresence of residual magnetism in the core.  The model can \nnot simulate the distortion appears in the very high frequency \nrange which is most probably caused by the end leads \nassociated with tap-changer leads and bushing tails.   \nIt can be seen from Fig. 11 that in the high frequency range, \nthe model and experimental responses are correlated to far \nextent. It can be concluded that the transformer frequency \nresponse is better emulated by retaining the core exciting \nimpedance.  \n \nIV. 4.\n C ONCLUSION  \nExperimental results for FRA technique have been \ndiscussed in this paper.
