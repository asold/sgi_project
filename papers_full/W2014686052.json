To \nempirically investigate whether or not a given species has ‘culture, ’ \nthe term must be operationally defined. Regardless of discipline, \nscholars agree that some form of social learning is a prerequisite \nand that culture is a source of uniformity within groups and differ-\nences between groups3, but the consensus ends here. Social learning \nis defined as learning (behaviour matching) that is influenced by \nobservation of, or interaction with another animal or its products4,5. \nSome definitions of culture require more complex cognitive social \nlearning mechanisms, such as pedagogy, theory of mind and imita-\ntion6,7. In most animal culture studies, examination of behavioural \nvariation within and between groups is fairly straightforward as \nanimals are either geographically or socially segregated 2. However, \n‘group’ is not easily defined in all animal societies. Like humans, \nShark Bay bottlenose dolphins live in an open community, charac -\nterized by high fission–fusion dynamics where members maintain \nlong-term preferential bonds, but associations are temporally and \nspatially variable across minutes, days and years 8. The question \nis therefore whether dolphins that use sponge tools (spongers) to \nextract prey9,10 exhibit homophily (the tendency to associate with \nsimilar others), based on this socially learned foraging tactic10,11.\nIn Shark Bay, Australia, a subset of the community of Indo-\nPacific bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops sp.) procure and wear bas -\nket sponges on their beaks while lightly scouring the seafloor for \nprey in deep (8–13  m) channels ( Fig. 1)9–12. Sponging is the best-\n documented case of tool use by wild cetaceans and is unique among \nwildlife in that only a small subset of the population uses tools. This \nexceptional case of tool-use heterogeneity allows us to test for pref-\nerential affiliation based on tool-use. To date, 55 dolphins have been \ndocumented habitually using sponges in the eastern gulf of Shark \nBay12, although sponging also occurs in the western gulf 13. Only \ncalves of spongers become spongers (24 offspring to date), but 8 \noffspring of spongers never adopted sponging. Sponging is a soli -\ntary activity, but calves accompany their mothers during sponging \nand vertical social learning is strongly implicated as the primary  \nmechanism of transmission 10,11,14, consistent with mitochondrial \nDNA analysis13,15.\nThe initial ‘culture’ claim for sponging proved contentious16–18, \nlargely stemming from application of the exclusion method 15 to \ndemonstrate social learning, and hence cultural behaviour. This \nmethod involves trying to eliminate genetic and environmental \nexplanations for a behavioural variant in a wild population, thus \nleaving social learning as the most plausible explanation for the \nvariant19. The main critique of the exclusion method is that it tries \nto prove the null and produces false negatives because ecological \nfactors often contribute to cultural behaviour 16,20. Regardless, this \nmethod is not appropriate for identifying sponge tool-use as cultural \nbehaviour, as environmental factors cannot be excluded; the deep \nchannels where sponging occurs have high basket sponge density21 \nand prey that are difficult to detect without sponge tools 12. Many, \nbut not all, animals that use these channels specialize in sponging \nand spongers spend more time using tools than any non-human \nanimal10. So, although Krützen et al.15 did not demonstrate social \nlearning per se , the social contribution is well-documented else -\nwhere10,11,14 and the strong ecological component does not refute \nthe argument that sponging is socially learned.\nWhat is lacking, however, is evidence that sponging distinguishes \nbetween groups. In virtually all other cases of animal tool-use or a \nputative cultural behaviour, all members of the group participate. \nAs spongers are a small subset of the community, we can explicitly \ntest for an affiliative function for the behaviour. In other taxa, indi-\nviduals develop the behaviour because they are part of the group; \nthey do not group because of the behaviour. Unlike tool-users in any \nother animal population, spongers interact with non-tool users for \nvariable amounts of time. If sponging is a cultural behaviour, it may \nfoster increased affiliation and homogeneity between spongers. This \nincrease in similarity is a natural precursor to conceptions of human \nculture, which focus on group identity, convention, homophily \nand adherence to norms 2,22–24. Similar to human subcultures, the \ndynamic nature of dolphin society allows them to associate based \non socially learned behaviours rather than simply conform to the \nnorms of the larger group they happen to be in. Therefore, we are \nspecifically interested in whether foraging similarity is a factor in \nsocial preference. As sponging is a solitary behaviour 10, affiliation \nbetween spongers would not be based on collective foraging, but \nrather on identifying other individuals as spongers. This attraction \nhas adaptive implications, in which homophily is likely to reinforce \nthe socially learned behaviour and influence horizontal information \ntransfer (for example, where to find sponges), even if the behaviour \nwas initially vertically learned from only one parent. We refer to our \nhypothesis, that spongers preferentially affiliate with other spongers \nas the ‘homophily hypothesis. ’\nIn Shark Bay, bottlenose dolphin females form relatively loose \nkin-based networks25,26, males form tight long-term alliances, and \nthere is no evidence of emigration27. Diverse foraging tactics charac-\nterize the population14 and most are female biased10,28. Males tend \nto adopt foraging tactics that are widely used in the population and \nfemales are more likely to specialize in tactics that are habitat spe -\ncific. We attribute the sex difference to the divergent reproductive \ntactics of males and females. Females require substantial resources \nto support large dependent offspring that nurse for 3–8 years29, and \nspecialization may enable them to meet those energetic demands. \nMales cannot afford to compromise their fitness by specializing in \nforaging tactics that would restrict their ability to form and main -\ntain alliances, or range widely to find females. To date, at least three \nattributes, matrilineal kinship, sex and geographic proximity, influ-\nence dolphin association25,26,30,31, but affiliation based on foraging \ntype has never been tested.\nHere we examine social patterns of both female and male spong-\ners and non-spongers. Because sponging does not occur throughout \nour study area, we control for ecological context by restricting our \nsample to dolphins with extensive geographic overlap with spongers \n(see Methods, Fig. 2). Within this sample, we examine homophily \nbased on foraging type while statistically controlling for kinship, sex \nand geographic proximity using the Multiple Regression Quadratic \nAssignment Procedure (MRQAP 32). This permutation method \nFigure 1 | Juvenile female sponger.

We found strong support for the homophily \nhypothesis, suggesting that dolphins form cultural subgroups based \non socially learned traits such as sponge tool-use.\nResults\nSex differences in overall social network metrics . Using all \nindividuals in our main study area with  > 11 sightings ( n = 421), \nwe examined sex differences for five basic social network metrics  \n(Table 1). As expected, based on male alliance structure 8,25,31, \npermutation tests revealed that males had higher strength, \neigenvector centrality and clustering coefficient than females. Given \nthese robust sex differences and the sex difference in sponging,  \nwe separated males and females for some subsequent analyses.\nSocial network metrics of female spongers and non-spongers .  \nAs expected, for animals within the core sponger area ( Fig. 2, \nn = 105), non-spongers had higher degree, strength and eigenvector \ncentrality than spongers. However, spongers had a higher clustering \n coefficient than non-spongers, suggesting they were significantly \nmore cliquish (Table 2).\nWithin-group and between-group affinity. To explore the relation-\nship between spongers and non-spongers, we compared social affinity  \nindices within and between groups (homophily versus hetero -\nphily) for animals located within the core sponger area ( Fig. 2).  \nAssociation within each group (sponger–sponger and non-sponger–\nnon-sponger) was significantly higher (mean  ± s.e. social affinity \nindex 0.039 ± 0.018) than between groups (sponger–non-sponger) \n(0.022 ± 0.014; Mantel test, t = 7.1433, P < 0.0001). The average social \naffinity index for sponger–sponger associations was 0.030  ± 0.012 \nT able 1 | Sex differences in social network metrics.\nSocial network metric Females (mean ± s.d.)

In a previous study we \nfound that female spongers were more solitary than non-sponger \nfemales10, but here we included eight male spongers and males  \ndiffer from females in terms of sociability in general ( Table 1). \nConsequently, we examined the effects of sex and foraging type on \nsociability by calculating the proportion of surveys that dolphins \nwere alone (dependent calves excluded) or with at least one other \ndolphin. A generalized linear mixed model, including the fixed \neffects sex, foraging type, and the sex by foraging type interaction \nas well as individual as a random effect, fit the data better than the \nnull model including only the random effect (likelihood ratio test, \nχ2 = 56.08, d.f. = 5, P < 0.0001). There were two main effects, one \nfor sex (Wald test: z =  − 3.73, P < 0.0001) and one for foraging type \n(Wald test: z = 3.97, P < 0.0001) and no significant interaction effects \n(Table 3). Thus, males were less solitary than females and spongers \nwere more solitary than non-spongers.\nMultiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure . We ran \nthe MRQAP regression model in two ways, first including all dol -\nphins within the core sponger area and second, by running males \nand females separately due to sex segregation in adult behaviour. \nIndeed, the negative MRQAP regression coefficient for matrilineal \nkinship in males countered the positive coefficient for matrilin -\neal kinship in females. Statistical methods for directly testing for \ninteractions with matrix data are still in development, and thus we \nwere not able to explore the interaction of factors in this model. All \nexplanatory variables predicted social affinity (Table 4).\nThe female only MRQAP model ( Table 5) showed results simi -\nlar to those of the model including both sexes ( Table 4), although \nnearly twice the variance is explained. We excluded kinship from \nthe Male MRQAP because there were too few pairs of maternally \nrelated dolphins. The Male MRQAP model continued to show \nthat centroid location is a strong predictor of affinity (linear coef -\nficient =  − 0.1391 ± 0.0956, P = 0.0140; log coefficient =  − 0.5647 ±  \n0.0576, P = 0.0005), but foraging homophily was not significant \n(sponger coefficient = 0.01344 ± 0.1128, P = 0.2599; non-sponger \ncoefficient = 0.0532 ± 0.1148, P = 0.0565; 2,756 dyads; r 2 = 0.196).\nCommunity clusters . We examined community clusters for dol -\nphins in the core sponger area ( N = 105, Fig. 3a) and in the larger \nnetwork ( N = 439, Fig. 3 b) with the goal of finding groups with \nstrong social affinity within a cluster and weaker social affinity out-\nside the cluster. The spongers in Fig. 3 a are the larger nodes and \nare concentrated in three of the four clusters. The spongers in the \ngreen cluster are all female and the majority of individuals in the \nred cluster are female (14 of 16). The blue cluster contains mostly \nmales, both spongers and non-spongers (20 males and 3 females). \nFigure 3 b shows six clusters for the entire community (439 dol -\nphins). Spongers were grouped into two of the six clusters shown \nin Fig. 3b. Although spongers are clearly not a separate community \nor subcommunity and have many non-sponger associates in both \nfigures, these clusters show that sponger homophily is imbedded \nin a larger subcommunity and spongers are not equally exposed to  \nall subcommunities.\nDiscussion\nWe set out to test whether sponge tool-use could be classified as \ncultural when culture is defined as both socially learned and distin-\nguishes between groups. In dynamic fission–fusion societies lack -\ning clear community boundaries, ‘group’ is better defined by relative \naffinity, as cliques or in terms of weighted (preferential) association. \nSpongers are imbedded in subcommunities and associate with non-\nspongers (Fig. 3a, b), but maintain strong homophily within their \nnetworks.

We suggest that spongers also \nshare in-group identity, but affiliation is a consequence of simi -\nlarity in the socially learned trait, a scenario that resonates with \nhuman culture22. Our results consistently supported the foraging \nhomophily hypothesis for females, but not for males (discussed \nbelow). Spongers were more cliquish, had more sponger associates \nand stronger bonds with each other than with non-spongers. The \nsignificance of foraging homophily remained even after controlling \nfor other factors that contribute to affiliation. These patterns are \nremarkable because spongers lead a relatively solitary lifestyle and \nhave weaker ties with other dolphins than non-spongers do. Given \nthat we included only non-spongers that are in the same habitat and \nhad a very high chance of associating with spongers, our results are \neven more striking. The mutual interests of spongers seem to influ-\nence the nature of their social relationships. This is the first demon-\nstration that a behaviour that is strictly vertically transmitted by a \nsingle parent serves an affiliative grouping function as well, thus \nmeeting both criteria for culture. To date, no material subcultures \nhave been identified outside of humans.\nWhile foraging type homophily held for females, it was weak for \nmales. First, given the apparent social and geographic constraints \nof sponging, male spongers would have difficulty developing and \nmaintaining effective alliances in their demographic. Only one \nmale sponger dyad had an affinity index within the range of male \nalliances ( > 0.5 (ref. 31)). Of the eight male spongers, five were in \none cluster and are all young adults ( Fig. 3a). The three other male \nspongers appeared to be split on age as well, with the single old \nmale sponger in one cluster and the two youngest male spongers \nin another cluster. We know little about the circumstances that lead \nsome males to sponge while others do not, but suspect that in addi-\ntion to maternal influence, other associates have a role. Specifically, \nsons of spongers might use cues from their same-sex associates to \ndetermine whether sponging is a viable technique. For daughters, it \nmight be more important to attend to maternal behaviour than their \nsame sex cohort36. Once sponging behaviour is established, female \nspongers formed clear cliques (Fig. 3a) and were predominantly in \ntwo of four clusters (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, the exceptions were three \nfemale spongers that were in the otherwise all-male cluster (Fig. 3a). \nThese females were young adults who have not successfully calved \nand were likely associating with males during repeated consortship \nevents. All of the other sponger females were either juveniles or had \nsuccessfully calved. Association patterns of these three spongers are \nlikely to change once they have offspring.\nDespite extensive interaction between spongers and non-spong-\ners, sponging does not spread horizontally or obliquely. Accord -\ning to the model proposed by Enquist et al.37, sponging would not \nrepresent shared cultural behaviour because vertically transmitted \nbehaviours are not widely shared. That is, most vertically transmit-\nted behaviours would not help in distinguishing between groups \nbeyond kinship. Indeed, some hunting tactics in Shark Bay appear \nto be vertically transmitted, but are restricted to only a few indi -\nviduals and might not involve preferential grouping outside of the \nmatriline14,28. However, while spongers are a small minority of the \npopulation, the trait does help distinguish between groups or cliques \nand could thus qualify as cultural behaviour. Uniparental transmis-\nsion does not necessarily preclude cultural behaviour. Homophily \namong spongers is likely to reinforce tool-use even though the calf \nhas only one cultural parent. In a dynamic fission–fusion society,  \na variety of traits are likely to influence association, including \nsponging. In Shark Bay, tool-use with sponges is a lifestyle that \nimpacts their activity budgets and social relationships. Shared life -\nstyles could also be a cue to relatedness, would enable more efficient \ninformation transfer and would reinforce sponging. As such, we do \nnot exclude the possibility that horizontal transmission influences \nsponging behaviour (for example, prey patches, locations and types \nof sponges available) even though sponging is initially established \nthrough vertical transmission.\nDolphins are substantial candidates for cultural behaviour given \nthat they have a flexible social system, plastic behavioural rep -\nertoires, vocal learning abilities, a high social tolerance, slow life \n histories, imitation abilities and large brains 29,38–41. We do not \nargue that foraging type is the primary determinant of association. \nDolphin association is likely to be driven by multiple factors, includ-\ning a suite of contexts such as behavioural state42, foraging type, the \nhistory of interactions, reproductive state, and enduring traits such \nas sex 25,26,31, kinship30,43, age 44 and geography 30. Homophily on \na variety of traits has a critical role in human (sub)cultures 22 and \nthis may be true for dolphin society as well. Sponging is unlikely to \nbe the only socially learned behaviour related to the frequency of \na b\nFigure 3 | Network clusters. (a) shows four clusters for the 105 dolphins in the core sponger area. Larger nodes are spongers. Ties are weighted by \nthe affinity index and represent clear cliques of spongers and non-spongers with a few interesting exceptions. The yellow cluster has 26 non-spongers \nand only 2 spongers, one old male and one old female ( > 30 years old). The red cluster has 18 non-spongers and 16 spongers, including 2 juvenile male \nspongers ( < 8 years old) that associate primarily with non-sponging males. The green cluster has ten spongers, all female, and ten non-spongers, all male \nmembers of one alliance (evident by tie strength). The blue cluster is virtually all male, with 5 male spongers, 15 non-sponging males and 3 young adult \nsponger females.

Calves tend to be socially similar to their mothers, sug-\ngesting that social network patterns might be socially transmitted36. \nAdult males appear to converge on signature whistles within an alli-\nance over time45,46, suggesting that there are affiliative functions to \nother socially learned behaviours. These are instances where affilia-\ntion drives the socially learned trait, rather than the reverse.\nCultural processes are integral to evolutionary dynamics. Under \ncertain conditions, selection is expected to favor social learning \nmechanisms and biases; the resulting behaviours are then favoured \nby socio-ecological and other processes, thereby reinforcing the \nevolution of social learning. In the dynamic, inherently flexible fis -\nsion–fusion social system that Shark Bay bottlenose dolphins live \nin, individuals vary on a wide range of features: sociability, net -\nwork structure, alliance formation, life history traits, habitat use \nand foraging tactics 10,11,14,21,25,26,29,31,36. Social tolerance, at least \nbetween females38, and low travel costs 47 allow dolphins from dif -\nferent cliques and subcommunities to associate with each other, \nincluding those with distinct attributes, histories and lifestyles. The \nchallenges of these diverse encounters might have shaped the evo -\nlution of individual variation, innovation, cognition and plasticity \nin dolphin populations, all of which contribute to the evolution of  \ncultural behaviour.\nMethods\nStudy site. Our main study site encompasses ~300 km2 in the eastern gulf of \nShark Bay, Western Australia (25°47′S 113°43′E). Over 1,500 residential bottlenose \ndolphins (Tursiops sp.) have been surveyed since 1984.\nSurveys. Surveys are opportunistic sightings of dolphins where the presence of \nindividuals during a 5-min interval is recorded. Dolphins were identified by  \nphoto-ID (distinctive body and dorsal fin markings). Association was determined \nvia a 10-m chain rule, in which individuals were considered to be associated if \nthey were within 10 m of each other or similarly linked by another. Behavioural, \ndemographic, reproductive and ecological data were also recorded. The current \nstudy used 14,651 surveys collected annually from 1989 to 2010.\nData restrictions. The survey sample included all dolphins with  > 11 sighting \nrecords across 3 or more years post-weaning (average ± s.e. surveys per dolphin, \n99.5 ± 6.3; N = 439, 212 females, 209 males). Dependent calves were excluded from \nall analyses. To limit the sample to animals with which spongers would have the \ngreatest possibility of associating with and who experience the same ecological  \ncontext as spongers, we calculated centroids for all 439 dolphins and further \nrestricted our sample to animals that fell within a minimum convex polygon \n(MCP) created around the 36 sponger centroids in this sample (Fig. 2). A centroid \ncorresponds to an average latitude and longitude and is a good measure of the \ncentral tendency of an animal’s location48. Only the last location point was used \nper day for each dolphin to reduce biases associated with our boat-launching site. \nThe sponger MCP (Fig. 2) includes 105 dolphins (53 males, 52 females; 74.7 ± 5.5 \nsurveys per dolphin) that are most likely to encounter spongers based on location \nand experience the same habitat as spongers. All but one of the 105 dolphins asso-\nciated with a sponger at least once. That is, we intentionally restricted our analysis \nto a sample that would be least likely to support the homophily hypothesis, because \nspongers and non-spongers would have a very high chance of association based on \ngeographic location alone. Dolphin home ranges are typically more than twice the \nsize of the sponger MCP27. We deliberately chose a smaller area so that there was \ncomplete geographic overlap between spongers and non-spongers. Finally, because \nspongers are more solitary than non-spongers10, we analysed the data by first \nincluding all survey records, and second, by excluding all solitary sightings  \nfor a dolphin. Because the results were identical, we report results that used all \nsighting data.\nSocial metrics. Owing to demographic changes, some dolphins were sighted over \nthe entire 22-year period, while others were sighted for a subset. Thus, we chose the \nsocial affinity index because it generally excludes demographic effects49. Social affi-\nnity indices were calculated in SOCPROG 2.4 (2010) using the following formula: \nx/Min{(x + yAB + yA),(x + yAB + yB)}, where x is the number of sampling days that  \nA and B were observed together; yA is the number of sampling days that A was  \nobserved without B, yB is the number of sampling days that B was observed without A \nand yAB is the number of sampling days in which A and B were both observed, but not \ntogether. W e also directly accounted for the complete lack of temporal overlap between \nsome dolphins (for example, a grandmother dies before her granddaughter is born) by \ncoding data as missing for a given dyad if they did not overlap.\nAll network ties were weighted based on the social affinity matrix. Weighting \nor quantifying the strength of ties is particularly critical in fission–fusion societies, \nwhere the frequency with which individuals are observed together is important \nto capture. We examined foraging type and sex differences for five major social \nnetwork metrics: degree, strength, betweenness, eigenvector centrality and cluster-\ning coefficient. Degree is the number of nodes (associates) that an individual is \ndirectly connected to (that is, total number of individual dolphins that a dolphin \nwas sighted with). Strength, also known as weighted degree, is the sum of weighted \nties (social affinity indices for these analyses) for a given individual. Betweenness \nis a measure of how often an individual falls on the shortest path connecting other \nindividuals in the network. Eigenvector centrality is a measure of an individual’s \nimportance in the network and is determined as the distance from other central \nindividuals relative to all others in the network. Clustering coefficient is a measure \nof cliquishness or how likely it is that the associates of one individual are also \ndirectly connected to each other.\nNon-social metrics. Non-social variables included sex, foraging type, kinship and \nlocation. We documented matrilineal relatedness for 28 of 36 spongers (known \nmother and/or offspring, including some offspring that did not adopt sponging) \nand for 98 of non-spongers; genetic relatedness was known for only 14 of these \nspongers13,15. As we have documented matrilineal relationships for 27 years,  \nthese data represent kinship that dolphins themselves would recognize through \nassociation with the mother, although additional kin recognition mechanisms \nare possible30. Centroid distances (km) between each dyad were calculated as a \nmeasure of geographic proximity.\nAnalyses. We examined differences in basic social network metrics between males \nand females as well as between spongers and non-spongers using two-sample per-\nmutation tests (R v.2.13.0, 10,000 permutations) with all confidence intervals  \n > 0.99. Because male social metrics differ from females (Table 1) and most  \nspongers are female, we restricted some of our comparisons to females only.\nTo determine whether there was a difference between sponger and non-\nsponger within versus between-group associations, we used a Mantel test to test for \na correlation between matrices. A Mantel test generates a test statistic quantifying \nthe association between two matrices, and then permutes them to generate a null \ndistribution for the test statistic, allowing us to calculate a P-value quantifying the \nstrength of evidence against the null hypothesis of no underlying association. We \nused a generalized linear mixed model with binomial error structures and logit link \nfunction to examine sociability (# of sightings alone versus not alone) with sex, for-\naging type and their interaction as fixed effects, and individual as a random effect.\nTo test whether similarity in maternal kinship, foraging type (sponger and non-\nsponger) sex and/or geographic proximity were significant predictors of associa-\ntions, we used the Double Dekker Semi-Partialling MRQAP32 in UCINET 6  \n(ref. 50). QAP regression is a type of Mantel test that allows for a response matrix \nto be regressed against multiple explanatory matrices that represent dyadic \nattribute relationships. QAP first runs a standard OLS regression and then  \nrandomly permutes the rows and columns of the dependent matrix (2,000× here), \nrecalculating the regression and creating a matrix-specific distribution against \nwhich the R2 and coefficients of the observed matrix can be compared to determine \nsignificance. Thus, MRQAP regression examines and controls for multiple factors \nwhen parameterizing a continuous dependent variable, and the results can be inter-\npreted similar to those of standard multiple regression; however, the permutation \napproach accounts for the structural autocorrelation inherent to social network \ndata32. Note that due to the limit on the number of possible correlations imposed \nby the structure of network data, the R2 of QAP regression is smaller than in OLS \nregression32,51. Social affinity indices were the response matrix, while maternal \nrelatedness, distance between centroids (geographic proximity), log transformed \ndistance between centroids, sex homophily and foraging type homophily (sponger \nand non-sponger) served as explanatory matrices. Sex homophily matrices were \ncreated by assigning a value of 1, if two dolphins were the same sex, and 0 other-\nwise. Two foraging type matrices were created; one in which sponger similarity was \nassigned a value 1, and one in which non-sponger similarity was assigned a value of 1. \nDissimilar dyads were coded as 0. Separate sponger and non-sponger homophily \nmatrices allowed us to determine whether similarity between one, both or neither \ngroups contributed to association.\nTo examine the position of spongers within the larger population, we applied \na community detection algorithm to our social affinity matrices. The goal of such \nalgorithms is to find clusters with strong connectivity and group them together. \nWhile a number of different algorithms exist, we used one which uses spin glass \nquality function from magnetic systems and modularity optimization in  \nits computation52. \nReferences\n1.
