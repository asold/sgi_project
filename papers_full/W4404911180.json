  "abstract": "Abstract Background Health-related rumors and misconceptions are spreading at an alarming rate, fueled by the rapid development of the internet and the exponential growth of social media platforms. This phenomenon has become a pressing global concern, as the dissemination of false information can have severe consequences, including widespread panic, social instability, and even public health crises. Objective The aim of the study is to compare the accuracy of rumor identification and the effectiveness of health science popularization between 2 generated large language models in Chinese (GPT-4 by OpenAI and Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration Bot [ERNIE Bot] 4.0 by Baidu). Methods In total, 20 health rumors and misconceptions, along with 10 health truths, were randomly inputted into GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot 4.0. We prompted them to determine whether the statements were rumors or misconceptions and provide explanations for their judgment. Further, we asked them to generate a health science popularization essay. We evaluated the outcomes in terms of accuracy, effectiveness, readability, and applicability. Accuracy was assessed by the rate of correctly identifying health-related rumors, misconceptions, and truths. Effectiveness was determined by the accuracy of the generated explanation, which was assessed collaboratively by 2 research team members with a PhD in nursing. Readability was calculated by the readability formula of Chinese health education materials. Applicability was evaluated by the Chinese Suitability Assessment of Materials. Results GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot 4.0 correctly identified all health rumors and misconceptions (100% accuracy rate). For truths, the accuracy rate was 70% (7/10) and 100% (10/10), respectively. Both mostly provided widely recognized viewpoints without obvious errors. The average readability score for the health essays was 2.92 (SD 0.85) for GPT-4 and 3.02 (SD 0.84) for ERNIE Bot 4.0 ( P =.65). For applicability, except for the content and cultural appropriateness category, significant differences were observed in the total score and scores in other dimensions between them ( P &lt;.05). Conclusions ERNIE Bot 4.0 demonstrated similar accuracy to GPT-4 in identifying Chinese rumors. Both provided widely accepted views, despite some inaccuracies. These insights enhance understanding and correct misunderstandings. For health essays, educators can learn from readable language styles of GLLMs. Finally, ERNIE Bot 4.0 aligns with Chinese expression habits, making it a good choice for a better Chinese reading experience.",
