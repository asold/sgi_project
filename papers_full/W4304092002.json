    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the Internet and the expanding scale of social media, incomplete social event classification has increasingly become a challenging task. The key for incomplete social event classification is to accurately leverage the image-level and text-level information. However, most of the existing approaches may suffer from the following limitations: (1) Most Generative Models use the available features to generate the incomplete modality features for social events classification while ignoring the rich semantic label information. (2) The majority of existing multi-modal methods just simply concatenate the coarse-grained image features and text features of the event to get the multi-modal features to classify social events, which ignores the irrelevant multi-modal features and limits their modeling capabilities. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Transformer-Based Conditioned Variational Autoencoder Network (AT-CVAE) for incomplete social event classification. In the AT-CVAE, we propose a novel Transformer-based Conditioned Variational Autoencoder to jointly model the textual information, visual information and label information into a unified deep model, which can generate more discriminative latent features and enhance the performance of incomplete social event classification. Furthermore, the Mixture-of-Experts Mechanism is utilized to dynamically acquire the weights of each multi-modal information, which can better filter out the irrelevant multi-modal information and capture the vitally important information. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public event datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of our AT-CVAE method.",
