    "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> As large language models become integral to various applications, ensuring the reliability and impartiality of their outputs is of paramount importance. The proposed methodologies for evaluating truthfulness, hallucinations, and bias in AI models represent a significant advancement, offering an automated and objective approach to validation without human intervention. Automated fact-checking systems, synthetic datasets, consistency analysis, and bias detection algorithms were integrated to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework. Results from these experiments indicated high accuracy in identifying truthful information, robust discernment of true versus false statements, stable performance across diverse scenarios, and effective mitigation of biases. These findings highlight the potential for enhancing AI reliability and fairness, contributing to the development of more trustworthy AI systems. Future research directions include expanding reference databases, refining synthetic datasets, and improving bias detection techniques to further enhance model evaluations.",
