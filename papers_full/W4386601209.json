  "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&nbsp;Early work on AI in libraries focused on information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP).&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;For example, in the 1980s and 1990s, researchers developed algorithms for automatically indexing and&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;categorizing library materials based on their content. One example of this work is the use of Latent&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Semantic Analysis (LSA) for text classification, which was pioneered by Thomas Landauer and&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;colleagues (Landauer, Foltz, and Laham 1998).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;In the early 2000s, AI technologies such as machine learning and data mining began to be used&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;more widely in libraries. These technologies were used to analyze large datasets of library usage data, to&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;identify patterns and trends in user behavior, and to develop predictive models for library services. For&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;example, researchers used data mining techniques to analyze circulation data and develop a model for&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;predicting which books are likely to be checked out next (Peng and Zhou 2009).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;In recent years, AI technologies such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and recommender systems have&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;become increasingly common in libraries. These technologies are used to provide personalized&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;assistance to library users, to help them find relevant resources, and to answer their questions. For&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;example, the University of Cambridge developed a chatbot called &ldquo;LibrarySearch&rdquo; that helps users find&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;books and other materials in the library&rsquo;s collection (Smith and Kargbo 2019). The use of AI in&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;libraries has evolved over time, from early work on information retrieval and NLP to more recent&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;applications of machine learning, data mining, chatbots, and recommender systems. There is &nbsp;a growing&nbsp;body of peer-reviewed literature on this topic, with many examples of successful applications of AI in libraries.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;The focus of this study is to analyze the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on specific&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;services offered by academic libraries in the near future. To assess the potential impact of AI on&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;academic library services, three distinct AI systems, namely ChatGPT, Perplexity, and iAsk.Ai are&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;utilized.&lt;/p&gt;",
