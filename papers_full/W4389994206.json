  "abstract": "Phishing attacks are a major threat to online security, resulting in millions of dollars in losses. These attacks constantly evolve, forcing the cyber security community to improve detection systems. One major problem with current detection systems is that they cannot detect new phishing attacks, such as Browser in the Browser (BiTB) and malvertising attacks. These attacks hide behind legitimate Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and can evade detection systems that only analyze a web page URL without exploring the page content. To address this problem, we propose PhishTransformer, a deep-learning model that can detect phishing attacks by analyzing URLs and page content. We propose only using URLs embedded within a webpage, such as hyperlinks and JFrames, to train PhishTransformer. This helps reduce the number of features that need to be extracted from the page content, which makes training the model more efficient. PhishTransformer combines convolutional neural networks and transformer encoders to extract features from website URLs and page content. These features are then used to train a classifier that can distinguish between phishing attacks and legitimate websites. We tested PhishTransformer on a dataset of 10,000 URLs. Our results show that PhishTransformer can achieve an F1-score of 99%, precision of 99%, and recall of 99%. This result suggests that PhishTransformer is a promising new approach to phishing detection.",
