However, it has \ngrown to a larger and more complex model based upon recent advancements in neuroscience such as pre-\ncise imaging studies of aphasic patients, diffusion tensor imaging studies, functional magnetic resonance \nimaging studies, and electrophysiological studies with cortical and subcortical stimulation during awake \nsurgery. In the present model, language is considered to be processed through two distinct pathways, the \ndorsal stream and the ventral stream. The core of the dorsal stream is the superior longitudinal fasciculus/\nAF, which is mainly associated with phonological processing. On the other hand, semantic processing is \ndone mainly with the ventral stream consisting of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the intratem-\nporal networks. The frontal aslant tract has recently been named the deep frontal tract connecting the sup-\nplementary motor area and the Broca’s area and it plays an important role in driving and initiating speech. \nIt is necessary for every neurosurgeon to have basic knowledge of the neural basis of language. This knowl-\nedge is essential to plan safer surgery and preserve the above neural structures during surgery.\nKey words: neural basis of language, awake surgery, hodotopy\nIntroduction\nSince Brodmann1) and Penfield et al.2) published their \nstudies, the localizationistic view of the brain has \nbeen overwhelming. it was hitherto thought that each \nbrain function is rigidly localized in a certain cortical \narea of the brain, and an injury to a certain area of \nthe cortex would lead to a loss of corresponding \nbrain function. in this view, cortices or cortical areas \nwhere neurons are located are more highlighted when \nconsidering the functional aspects of the brain, rather \nthan white matter. however, recent advancements in \nneuroscience have suggested that the brain is organ\n-\nized in a complex network of multiple distinct neural \ncircuits,\n3) and works more like a dynamic network \nwith plasticity. “hodotopy” or the “hodotopic frame \nwork” is a new concept proposed by Catani et al., 4) \nwhich includes both topological (cortical functional \nepicenters) and hodological (connectivity between \nareas) views for understanding a particular brain \nfunction and its neural basis. in this framework, the \nbrain, inside which the gray and white matters are \npart of the same interactive process, is organized as \ncomplex, multimodal, and integrated parallel distributed \nnetworks, with a cognitive process consisting of a \ncontinuous and often redundant stream of information \ndynamically modulated by experience and external \nenvironment.\n3) when considering the neural basis \nof a function or dysfunction, especially cognitive \nfunctions such as language, it is important to focus \non not only cortices but also on both cortices and \nwhite matter as a network. \nattitudes toward interpretation of the neural basis \nare different between the conventional topological \napproach and hodological/hodotopic approach, espe\n-\ncially in the study of patients with a certain cogni -\ntive symptom. each patient with the same dysfunc -\ntion does not necessarily have an identical lesion,  received: january 14, 2016; accepted: March 16, 2016\nonline april 16, 2016\ndoi: 10.2176/nmc.ra.2016-0014\nNeurol Med Chir (Tokyo) 56, 379–386, 2016\nREVIEW  ARTICLE\n379\nM. Fujii et al.\n380\nNeurol Med Chir (Tokyo) 56, July, 2016\nbut demonstrates variation in the involved area. in \nthe topological approach, the commonly injured \ncortical area among the patients with certain cogni\n-\ntive dysfunction is considered as the center of the \nfunction.\n5) in the hodological approach, on the other \nhand, because the function is considered as a repre -\nsentation of a network, each patient has a certain \ninjury in a part of network of the function.\n6) there \nis a good example demonstrating modern interpreta -\ntion of a part of neural basis of language. Dronkers \net al. reported a re-study of Paul Broca’s historical \ncases with magnetic resonance imagings (Mris) of the \noriginal patients’ brains. they found that the lesions \nextended far deeper than the cortical areas that Broca \nwas able to report and that the superior longitudinal \nfasciculus (SLF), which is a major association fiber \ntract connecting the frontal lobe and parietal lobe, \nwas involved.\n7) in fact, it is now known that injury \nof merely the cortical area of Broca’s speech center \ndoes not cause “Broca’s aphasia,” but causes only \ntransient speech disturbance or a more moderate form \nof aphasia.\n8,9) Broca’s aphasia occurs when injury \ninvolves wider cortical areas than the Broca area, \nincluding the middle-inferior part of the precentral \ngyrus (PreCG) and the white matter underneath those \nareas.\n9,10)\nthis article attempts to describe the neural basis \nof language as a simple model based on recent \nadvancements in neuroscience such as precise \nimaging studies of aphasic patients, diffusion tensor \nimaging studies, functional Mri studies, fiber dissec\n-\ntion studies, and electrophysiological studies with \ncortical and subcortical stimulation during awake \nsurgery, especially focusing on the white matter \npathways. even though the neural basis of language \nis not yet fully understood and is apparently not as \nsimple as detailed in this article, basic knowledge \nof the same is still vital for neurosurgeons, since it \ncould help to preserve patients’ language function \nand enable further contributions to neuroscience.   \nThe Neural Basis of Language\nthe classical model of neural basis of language \nconsists of the Broca’s area (the motor speech center), \nthe wernicke’s area (the sensory speech center), and \nthe arcuate fasciculus (aF) connecting the above two \ncortical areas. however, the model has grown to a \nlarger and more complex one based upon recent \nadvancements in neuroscience, comprising the frontal, \ntemporal, and parietal language areas. the terms \n“Broca’s area” and “w ernicke’s area” are still used \nworldwide in many literatures, although it is known \ntoday that they are not the sole and definite language \ncenters of the frontal or temporal lobe. therefore, we \nhave used the same terms to designate certain cortical \nareas as defined in this article. Broca’s area is the \npars triangularis and opercularis of the inferior frontal \ngyrus (iFG), corresponding to the Brodmann area 45 \nand 44, respectively. wernicke’s area is defined as the \n \ncortical area of the posterior StG and a part of \nthe SMG, corresponding to the Brodmann area 22. \n \nthe present model consists of two major pathways, the  \ndorsal stream and the ventral stream 11) (Fig. 1). the  \ndorsal stream is supported mainly by the SLF/aF \nand associated with phonological processing.\n12) o n \nthe other hand, semantic processing occurs through \nthe ventral stream supported mainly by the inferior \nfronto-occipital fasciculus (iFoF).\n12) Briefly, one of the \npossible and reliable models based on the present \nneuroscience is described below in accordance with the \nFig. 1 Dual stream model of neural basis of language. \nThe neural basis of language has been evolving to a \nmore complex model with involvement of many cortical \nareas and white matter tracts than the classical model \nsimply consisting of the Broca and Wernicke centers \nand the arcuate fasciculus (AF) connecting the above \ntwo. In the dual stream model proposed by Hickok  \net al.,\n11) the major network of language processing consists \nof two streams, the dorsal and ventral streams in the \ndominant hemisphere. The dorsal stream is associated \nwith phonological processing via the superior longitudinal \nfasciculus (SLF) as a major trunk of the network. The \nSLF/AF consists of several subcomponents in two layers, \nthe SLF II, the SLF III, and the SLF temporo-parietal \n(SLF TP) in the superficial layer and the classical AF \nin the deep layer.\n6,39,40) The ventral stream is associated \nwith semantic processing. It is assumed that the network \nconsists of intra-temporal network, such as the middle \nlongitudinal fasciculus (MLF)\n27,28) and the inferior longitu-\ndinal fasciculus (ILF), 29) and the inferior fronto-occipital \nfasciculus (IFOF)33) as an inter-lobe network. Adding to the  \ndural stream model, there is another system inside the \nfrontal lobe for “driving of speech.” Recently named \nthe frontal aslant tract (FAT) 46,47) is probably associated \nwith initiation and spontaneity of speech.\nNeural Basis of Language\n381\nNeurol Med Chir (Tokyo) 56, July, 2016\nsteps of functional aspects of language from perception \nto expression. indeed, an electrophysiological study \nof the Broca’s area demonstrated a series of language \nprocessing, lexical, grammatical, and phonological \ninformation that occurred in a sequential manner \nwithin a time window of 450 ms.\n13) however, please \nnote and understand that the stepwise processes \ndescribed expediently is only a one-sided view of \nlanguage and may occur not only sequentially, but \nalso simultaneously, with dynamic interactions in \nmany cortical areas, even bilateral hemispheres, in \nreality.\n14–16) in this article, only spoken language will \nbe focused on without mentioning written language \nfunction, i.e., reading and writing.\n1. From sound to phoneme\nthe first step of the speech comprehension \nis the conversion of the sound of language into \nphonemes, followed by storing them over a short \nperiod of time. this step is processed in the sub-\nnetwork including the superior temporal gyrus \n(StG), which is located adjacent to the heschl’s \ngyrus, namely the primary auditory area\n17,18)   \n(Fig. 2a). this sub-network might be supported \nby rostral and caudal streams originating from the \nprimary auditory cortex, i.e., the h eschl’s gyrus, \nin the superior temporal gyrus.\n19) this area is also \nassociated with “auditory short term memory” that \nperforms as one of the subsystems of the working \nmemory.\n20) the phonological process also occurs in \nassociation with the PreCG via the aF/SLF 21) and \nthe Broca’s area. 22) injury of this subsystem gives \nrise to pure word deafness (word sound deafness), \nwhich is a specific disturbance of discrimination of \nthe word sounds.\n23) Patients with pure word deaf -\nness, however, are able to communicate through \nreading and writing. recent studies with functional \nMri suggest that voice perception and processing \nof phonemes occurs in the bilateral hemisphere.\n15,24)\n2. access to lexicon and semantic process of words\nthe series of phonemes perceived in the above \nsystem are transferred to the middle temporal gyrus, \naccessing the word/lexicon, and meaning of the \nword\n18,25) (Fig. 2B). the posterior part of the middle \ntemporal gyrus (MtG) is involved in accessing the \nlexicon, associating with not only auditory compre\n-\nhension but also with expression of word by selecting \nword and phonemic processing of voice encoding \nvia the aF.\n26) the anterior part of the MtG is more \ninvolved in the semantic processing of words and \nselecting of specific words (lexical retrieval). the \nmiddle longitudinal fasciculus (MLF),\n27,28) the infe -\nrior longitudinal fasciculus (iLF), 29) and the iFoF, 12) \nas well as the u fibers and other short association \nfibers inside the temporal lobe are the components \nof network infrastructure. intra-temporal network \nis associated with both phonological and semantic \nprocess of words. t he lexical process, however, \nis not completed only in the temporal lobe. even \nword-level processing is also integrated into the \nnetwork described below. \n3. Complex semantic process of sentence and context\nMore complex semantic process above the word \nlevel, such as sentences and context, takes place in \nmany cortical areas, temporal lobe except for the \nStG, the inferior parietal lobule (iPL), and the iFG. \nthe complex process includes process of syntax, \nsemantic process of context, and selection of words \nin association with semantic memory. Such a large \nnetwork among multiple cortical areas is probably \nsupported by the iFoF,\n18,30–32) which is one of the \nlongest tracts in the human brain, connecting the \nabove cortical areas (Fig. 2B). the iFoF is known to \nhave two layers.\n33) the superficial layer is considered \nto connect the superior parietal lobule, the occipital \nextrastriate cortex, the wernicke’s area, and the fusi\n-\nform area at the occipito-temporal junction to the \niFG (the pars orbitaris and triangularis), all of which \nare likely associated with the process of language\n33)  \n(Fig. 1). the deep layer originates in areas similar to \nthose described above and terminates in wider areas of \nthe frontal lobe, namely the orbitofrontal cortices, the \nmiddle frontal gyrus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal \ncortex, and is probably associated with language and \nother cognitive functions.\n33) the iFG, as well as the \nMFG (lateral prefrontal cortex; LPFC), are involved \nespecially in the process of syntax and enhancement \nof efficiency of semantic process of sentences.\n13,14,30,34) \nKinno et al.14) identified three syntax-related networks \nand reorganization of them in glioma patients with \nagrammatic comprehension, suggesting that there is, \nin fact, redundancy or plasticity with multiple sub-\nnetworks in the syntax processing. interestingly, the \niFG or MFG (LPFC) was associated with all three \nnetworks and one of them involves participation \nof the contralateral hemisphere. as for the iPL, the \nangular gyrus is probably associated with semantic \nprocess,\n35) whereas the supra marginal gyrus (SMG) \nis more involved in phonological process. 36,37)\n4. Phonological processing\nPhonological process is mainly done with the \ndorsal stream in which the frontal, parietal, and \ntemporal lobe are all connected by the SLF/aF\n11,12,38) \n(Fig. 2C). Conversion from the sound of voice into \nphoneme, lexical retrieval, repetition, and articula\n-\ntion are associated with this stream. the SLF/aF \nconsists of several subcomponents in two layers, the \nM. Fujii et al.\n382\nNeurol Med Chir (Tokyo) 56, July, 2016\nFig. 2 A–E: Illustrations of neural basis of language networks, left hemisphere, and lateral view. A: From \nsound to phoneme. The first step of auditory comprehension of speech, conversion of the sound of language \ninto phonemes, is located in the STG adjacent to the Heschl’s G, namely the primary auditory area. 17,18)  \nThis area is also associated with “auditory short-term memory” that played as one of the subsystems of the \nworking memory.\n20) This network is mainly supported by the U fibers among the area. B: Access to lexicon \nand semantic processing. The series of phonemes perceived in the above system are transferred to the MTG, \naccessing the word/lexicon and meaning of the word. The middle longitudinal fasciculus (MLF),\n27,28)  the infe-\nrior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), 29) and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), 33) as well as the U \nfibers and other short association fibers inside the temporal lobe are the candidates of network infrastruc-\nture. More complex semantic process above word level, such as sentences and context takes place in many \ncortical areas, temporal lobe except for the STG, the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and the inferior frontal \ngyrus (IFG). Such a large network among multiple cortical areas is probably supported by the IFOF , which \nis one of the longest tracts in human brain and connects the above cortical areas.\n18,30–32)  C: Phonological \nprocessing. Phonological processing is mainly done with the dorsal stream in which the frontal, parietal, \nand temporal lobe are all connected by the SLF/AF .\n11,12,38)  Conversion from the sound of voice into phoneme, \nlexical retrieval, repetition, and articulation are associated with this stream. The SMG, PostCG, and the \nposterior part of STG connected with SLF/AF located under these cortices are profoundly associated phono-\nlogical processes.\n20,36)  D: Articulation. The middle-inferior part of the dominant PreCG and its subcortical \narea is associated with articulation and its damage result in speech apraxia or, in other words, anarthria, in \nwhich the patients have symptoms such as loss of prosody, i.e., mal-connection of phonemes and distortion of \nphoneme. Damage in the anterior part of PreCG (Broadman area 6 and 4) tends to enhance loss of prosody \nor mal-connection of phonemes more, whereas damage in the posterior part of the PreCG (Broadman area 4)  \ntends to cause distortion of phonemes. 43) E: Driving of speech. There is a pathway for initiation/driving of \nspeech. The supplementary motor area and the medial aspect of the frontal lobe have been known to be asso-\nciated with spontaneity and initiation of speech.\n44) An intra-frontal network connecting between the medial \naspect of the frontal lobe and the IFG and the middle-inferior part of PreCG, recently named as the frontal \naslant tract (FAT) is suggested to have strong association with speech function.\n46–48) .

Driving of speech\nthere is another pathway for language, associating \nwith initiation of speech (Fig. 2 e). the supple -\nmentary motor area and the medial aspect of the \nfrontal lobe have been known to be associated with \nspontaneity and initiation of speech.\n44) Moreover, it \nis well known that an injury to the SMa and/or \ndeep frontal white matter causes transcortical motor \naphasia.\n45) in fact, there is an intra-frontal network \nconnecting the medial aspect of the frontal lobe \nand the iFG and the middle-inferior part of PreCG, \nrecently named as the frontal aslant tract (F at).\n46) \nelectrophysiological studies with direct electrical \nstimulation of the tract during awake surgery also \nsuggested strong association with speech function.\n47,48) \nthe fronto-striatal tract, running medially to the \nFat from the SMa to the caudate nucleus, might \nalso be involved in this system. 48)\nSurgical Implications\nNeurosurgeons have traditionally believed in distinc-\ntive “the eloquent and non-eloquent” cortices in \nlanguage and performed surgery based upon quite \na localizationistic view. the cortical areas of Broca \nand wernicke are the eloquent cortices in which \ntumors are unresectable, unless one can risk losing \nspeech function, and the other cortical areas are \nnon-eloquent cortices where surgical procedure is \nnot supposed to cause significant speech dysfunc\n-\ntion. through the accumulation of experiences \nwith electrophysiological mapping during awake \nsurgery, it is better understood that the above central \ndogma is frequently not the case, especially in \nslow growing tumors such as low grade gliomas.\n3) \nLow grade gliomas invading into the Broca’s area \ncan often be resected safely.\n49)  recently, Saito  \net al.50) reported that the frontal language area could \nnot be identified on intraoperative brain mapping \nin gliomas involving the pars triangularis of the \niFG frequently, suggesting that language network \nreorganization does occur in slow growing tumors. \ntumors in the w ernicke area are also sometimes \nresectable when surgery is done carefully in the \nawake setting, thanks to plasticity of the brain and \nredundancy of the language network.\n51,52) Moreover, \neven though a cortical area cannot be resected for \npreserving language function, if the tumor recurs, \nthat area would no longer be functioning and, thus \ncould be resected in a second surgery.\n53)\nNeurosurgeons have tended to focus on preservation \nof the cortex and thus, surgery has been sometimes \nperformed based on the functional information of \nlanguage obtained only through cortical mapping \nstudies with subdural electrodes, without real-time \nevaluation of the white matter. Since the gray and \nwhite matters are part of the same interactive process \nin the network, with dynamic process of language \nconsisting of a continuous and redundant stream \nM. Fujii et al.\n384\nNeurol Med Chir (Tokyo) 56, July, 2016\nof information, 3) surgery must be performed in the \nawake setting, evaluating the symptoms online \nduring surgery with attention to not only the cortex, \nbut also the white matter, which is the substrate \nor backbone of the network.\n48,54) For preservation \nof language in tumor surgery, evaluation of the \nwhite matter with electrical stimulation is no less \nimportant than evaluation of the cortex. \nIntraoperative Mapping of the  \nLanguage Function\nFor preserving language function, cortical mapping \nof the language, as well as subcortical mapping is \nmandatory under awake surgery.\n12) there are two \ngroups of neurosurgeons with respect to electro-\ncortical mapping methods; they are called the “posi\n-\ntive mapping” and the “negative mapping” strate -\ngies.12,50,55) the positive mapping strategy postulates \nthat surgeons should observe “positive findings” \nsuch as speech arrest or anomia, at least in one \ncortical area in order to obtain the positive control \nto confirm that the entire mapping result is effec\n-\ntive. when the mapping procedure elicits symptoms, \nthose areas resulting in negative mapping with the \nsame stimulation protocol could be considered as \ntruly negative and, thus judged to be safely resect\n-\nable. From the viewpoint of the negative mapping \nstrategy, which was first introduced by Sanai et al., \nthe positive finding is not always necessary if the \nbrain is stimulated with enough intensity.\n55) it might \nallow a smaller craniotomy and less risk of seizure \nattack due to the strong stimulation intensity. \nalthough language has many functional aspects as \ndescribed above, it is difficult to evaluate each and \nevery aspect of language during awake surgery in \na limited time that the patients are able to tolerate, \nthus the language tasks should be selected appropri\n-\nately, depending on the patient’s back ground (living \nenvironment, occupation, etc.), and the tumor loca\n-\ntion plus the relevant white matter tracts. 12) Picture \nnaming is the most frequently used task for evalu -\nation for all brain areas associated with language \nfunction, both cortical and subcortical, probably \nbecause it needs multiple steps of the language \nprocessing, visual recognition, semantic processing, \nlexical access, phonological encoding, and speech \nproduction.\n12,56) Counting tasks are especially useful \nfor speech articulation.12,56) it is almost always possible \nto elicit speech arrest on the middle-inferior part \nof the PreCG, i.e., the ventral premotor cortex,\n12,57) \nwith either the counting or picture naming task. \nthis finding is therefore considered to be a posi\n-\ntive control of the mapping and the intensity of the \nstimulation is utilized thereafter for both cortical and \nsubcortical mapping.\n12) the auditory comprehension \ntask is necessary, especially in the temporal and \nparietal lobe lesions to assess the perceptive aspects \nof language.\n56) it also reflects the semantic processing. \nthe repetition task is not necessarily associated with \nthe semantic processing but mainly with the phono\n-\nlogical processing, including the perceptive aspects \nof the language. it should be used when mapping in \nand around the SMG and the subcortical area under\n-\nneath where SLF is running as the main association \nfiber of phonological processing.\n12) the semantic \naspects can be evaluated by using the pyramid and \npalm trees test, which are a semantic memory task, \nand the auditory comprehension task as described \nabove. the iFoF, one of the main association fibers \nof semantic processing, is frequently encountered in \nthe insular gliomas or the insulo-opercular gliomas \nwith either the frontal or the temporal involvement, \nor both, usually at a deeper surgical field such as \nthe white matter under the iFG or anterior insula \nor the temporal stem.\n12) the F at might be encoun -\ntered in the frontal lobe tumors in the white matter \nunderneath the superior frontal sulcus and middle \nfrontal gyrus, with slowness or speech arrest as \nsymptoms of electrical stimulation.\n47) \nConclusion\nexploring the neural basis of language continues \nworldwide. it is likely entering into a new paradigm \nwith a drastic change in the view of the brain itself, \nprogressing from the rigid and localizationistic to \nthe flexible and associationistic view.\n6) Please note \nthat the neural basis of language described in this \narticle is a summary of the present knowledge and \nonly a one-sided view with a lot of controversial \npoints. each neurosurgeon should keep updating \ntheir knowledge of the neural basis of language and \nnot only use it for everyday patient care, but also \nplay a role in the progress of neuroscience for the \nbetter care in the future, since we are the only ones \nwho face the living human brain under direct vision.\nConflicts of Interest Disclosure\nthe authors have no conflict of interest regarding \nthis article.\nReferences\n 1) Brodmann K: Vergleichende lokalisationslehre der \ngrosshirnrinde in ihren prinzipien dargestellt auf \ngrund des zellenbaues.
