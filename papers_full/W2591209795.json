    "abstract": "This paper presents the design approach used in designing transformers mostly used in power supplies and power systems. The paper will cover theoretical principles applied in analyzing magnetic circuits to better understand the operation of the transformer. Since well-designed transformer is supposed to meet the specifications of the environment that it is going to be used, there is a need to confirm after the transformer is built to make sure that it is going to operate efficiently and without a failure. Therefore, this paper will also present the traditional methods used to test transformers in the industries to make sure that it will operate within the prescribed loading limits and voltages. This paper will cover the transformer losses in detail including the test methods used to calculate nameplate parameters for power transformers used in power systems.",
