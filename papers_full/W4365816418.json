More needs to be done to address these gaps mean-\ningfully, and more meaningful participation could be a crucial undertaking to achieve this.\nRegistration The study protocol was registered before the study (10.17605/OSF.IO/9D25R) at https:// osf. io/ 9d25r.\nKeywords Humanitarian, Localisation, Participation Digital health, Displaced populations, Digital divide, Health \ninequities, Low-and-middle-income countries\nIntroduction\nBackground\nToday, the number of forcibly displaced people due to \nconflict, violence, climate change, and natural-hazard-\nrelated disasters exceeds 100 million [1, 2]. The major -\nity of these are located within low and middle-income \ncountries (LMIC) [3, 4] with health systems that can be \ncharacterised as insufficient or disrupted [5, 6]. Forced \ndisplacement is a critical determinant of poor health [7, \n8] and is disproportionally protracted [9] with an average \nof 20 years [10]. The extended nature of displacement can \nresult in long-term dependencies upon states who may \nbe unable or unwilling to provide essential health and \nhumanitarian services. International policy frameworks \nsuch as the 1951 Refugee Convention [11], International \nHuman Rights Law [12], the Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs) [13, 14] and the Global Refugee Compact \n[15, 16] all aim to support displaced people “through \ninclusive and comprehensive approaches” [17]. However, \nthe reality is that the global health burden has stretched \nfinite response resources and failed to reach all those in \nneed [18, 19].\nIn the search for innovation and improvement, digi -\ntal tools have been transformative within the humani -\ntarian health sphere [20– 22]. Digital health refers to a \nbroad range of information communication technol -\nogy that, alongside experts or lay helpers or as self-\nhelp models, aims to help prevent and manage disease, \nas well as improve health and wellness [23]. Promoted \nas cost-effective and scalable tools [24, 25], they have \nthe potential to respond to a variety of critical health \nchallenges faced within humanitarian crises today [26]. \nHowever, the convergence of digital health tools into \nthe humanitarian sphere is not without risk. Digital \nhealth tools have the potential to exacerbate existing \nsocietal vulnerabilities and inequalities through exclu -\nsion or discrimination. As the aim of humanitarian \naction is to save lives and reduce suffering, its deliv -\nery must be appropriate, timely and according to need. \nAddressing potential risks, International Humanitarian \nLaw (IHL) [27] and the core humanitarian principles \n(HP) of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and inde -\npendence [28] provide guidance here to humanitar -\nian practitioners in ensuring harm is not caused in the \nprovision of humanitarian aid. The Sphere Standards \n[29] and the Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS) [30] \nprovide practical support for applying IHL and HP in \nhumanitarian action.\nThe introduction of digital innovations in humanitar -\nian space, primarily a product of the Western World, is \nrepresentative of a prevailing dominance within contem -\nporary humanitarian action. Humanitarian crises mainly \noccur within LMIC, yet the leading response system is \ngoverned by an international set of actors and practices. \nThis western ascendency continues despite the recogni -\ntion that local actors offer relevant skills, experience, \nand expertise in crises [31–33]. The Sphere Standards \noutline active community participation as a key pillar \nwithin the Humanitarian Charter and minimum opera -\ntional standards for all sectors of contemporary humani -\ntarian action [29]. The CHS outlines that humanitarian \nresponse should be informed by participation and feed -\nback [benchmark 4] [30]. These standards aim to cen -\ntre crisis-affected people in response decision-making \nand rebalance uneven power dynamics in the delivery of \nhumanitarian action.\nDespite these well-accepted humanitarian stand -\nards, local responders remain marginalised by interna -\ntional humanitarian efforts [34–36], resulting in uneven \nhumanitarian assistance. Paradoxically, the paternalistic \nhumanitarian system perpetuates the same inequalities \nand injustices it seeks to address. This causes a “crisis \nof legitimacy” [37] for the “broken” international system \n[38], often across colonial fault lines. This paradox was \ndiscussed at the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) in \n2016 [39, 40] with calls for systemic reform [41]. From \nthese discussions, Localisation was a major reform tenet. \nThe Localisation Agenda pivoted around ten commit -\nments aiming to collectively shift the dominant paradigm \npower within humanitarian responses to be “as local as \npossible, as international as necessary” [42]. One work -\nstream to achieve localisation is the Participation Revo -\nlution [43]. This was outlined as a mechanism to shift \npower to crisis-affected people by involving them in the \ndecision-making that affects their lives. Localisation as \na set of collective commitments was promoted to recali -\nbrate and ameliorate humanitarian action as an act of \nempowerment [44–48].\nPage 3 of 19\nBenson et al. Conflict and Health  (2023) 17:20\n \nParticipatory action is not new. There is much schol -\narly literature on the benefits of participation within \nhumanitarian and health care interventions and research, \nspanning several decades. With a focus on digital health \nspecifically, O’Connor, Hanlon and O’Donnell et  al. ’s \nsystematic review [49] explores barriers to participation \nwithin digital health projects. They found motivation, \npersonal values, the engagement approach, and the qual -\nity of the intervention to be key participatory obstacles \nand recommend more attention towards engagement \nstrategies and personalised digital health tools. Through \nparticipation, the adaptation of health interventions to \naddress specific groups was considered highly important \nin overcoming barriers in mental health. Gearing et  al. ’s \nsystematic review [50] agreed with these findings and \nconcluded that one of the main barriers was contextual \nunacceptability of interventions.\nA recent study ‘Nothing about us without us?’ [51] \nhighlighted the important user involvement roles within \nmental health interventions in humanitarian crises. This \npaper concluded that current participation practices \nwere considered “predominantly tokenistic” [51] and \ntransactional, with a lack of guidance on how to carry \nout meaningful and ethical user involvement within \ninterventions. However, Greenhalgh et  al. ’s systematic \nreview of participation of users in research [52] found \n65 different frameworks developed to assess and guide \nparticipation. These were grouped by type according to \npurpose for identifying power, priorities, studies, report -\ning and partners [52]. For assessing engagement in health \nresearch, they outlined principles of patient-centredness, \nusing plain language, shared responsibility for the study \nand its outputs, checking assumptions, ensuring mean -\ningful community outcomes, and partner skill building \nthrough the process [52].\nArnstein’s Ladder of Citizen Participation [53] concep -\ntualises each rung as a greater extent of interaction and \ngreater power gains. The ladder is split into three main \ngroups; the first is non-participation, which includes \nmanipulation, therapy and informing. The second group \nis degrees of tokenism, which includes consultation and \nplacation. The third group, the highest on the ladder, \nincludes partnership, delegated control and ultimately \ncitizen control. The CDAC Scale of Community Engage -\nment [54] mirrors the ladder framework with its five \nstages of increasing interaction with communities and \naims for community leadership as the gold standard. \nThe commonality between these frameworks is they all \noutline that best participatory action is inclusive, deep, \nand multi-faceted, where powershifts can affect process \noutcomes.\nThis aligns with the increasing humanitarian awareness \nof power dynamics and ethical approaches to research \nand action. In recent years there has been a greater focus \non accountability and engagement [55–57] with stand -\nards set up for protection and inclusion of specific com -\nmunity groups, all with the aim to better protect and \nprovide for those affected by humanitarian crises.\nDespite the ongoing empowerment and effectiveness \nnarratives, climate related emergencies and the unequal \nglobal Covid-19 response highlight some of the per -\nvasive structural inequalities within the international \nhumanitarian and health systems [58]. As recognition \nand acknowledgement of racism, discrimination and \ncolonisation grows in the global consciousness, following \nkey worldwide events and movements, humanitarian and \nhealth communities are being confronted by the systemic \ninjustices that underpin them [59]. The Localisation \nAgenda has parallels with anti-racism and decolonisation \nmovements in calling for a shift in power toward those \ndisproportionately affected by colonial consequences [60, \n61].\nRationale and objectives\nIf power is to be shifted then the Localisation Agenda \nmust become more than just rhetoric: Action should \nbe reparative and empowering and break free from tra -\nditional binds of power [62]. There are several local \norganisations that have emerged to progress the Locali -\nsation Agenda as part of their work: The Charter for \nChange (C4C) [63] is a collection of over 50 international \norganisations that have committed themselves to local -\nise humanitarian aid. The Network for Empowered Aid \nResponse (NEAR) [64] is a network movement of local \nand national societies that promote and advocate for \nequitable partnerships within humanitarian aid. The Alli-\nance for Empowering Partnerships (A4EP) [65] supports \nsustainable cooperation underpinned by the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights. The Global Refugee-Led \nNetwork [66] advocates for greater representation in \nglobal humanitarian aid decision-making. These organi -\nsations all demonstrate an appetite and capability for \nlocally led crisis solutions. Despite this, global health \nand humanitarian policy efforts have largely continued \nwith a top-down approach [67, 68]. This is illustrated by \nthe seven dimensions of localisation as laid out in the \nNEAR Localisation Performance Measurement Frame -\nwork [69], and the Global Mentoring Initiative’s Dimen -\nsions of Localisation Framework (GMI) [45]. These \nwidely accepted frameworks outline localisation through \ndomains of partnerships, funding, capacity, coordination, \npolicy influence and visibility and participation. Collec -\ntively, these systemic dimensions frame localisation as a \ntechnocratic fix. Whilst this approach may be applicable \nto a diverse set of organisations it falls short of capturing \nPage 4 of 19Benson et al. Conflict and Health  (2023) 17:20\nthe intersectionality of the power paradigm within the \nreality of humanitarian assistance.\nSince the humanitarian imperative of health action is to \nsave lives and reduce suffering in crises [70], it is a wor -\nthy endeavour to reorientate ourselves to the crisis level \nto contribute to scholarly critique within this domain. \nFocusing in on one of these dimensions, participation, \ndue to its greatest proximity to crisis-affected people, we \nenquire through a power lens: How has the Participation \nRevolution been adopted within digital health interven -\ntions for displaced people within LMIC? This study seeks \nto investigate this phenomenon.\nApplying a scoping review approach to map out, syn -\nthesise and critically explore existing scholarship through \na power lens, this paper aims to investigate the partici -\npation of displaced people within digital health humani -\ntarian efforts. To achieve this, we investigate (A) the \ncharacteristics of digital health tools used by displaced \npeople in LMIC; (B) the characteristics of the interven -\ntions themselves (C) how and to what extent participa -\ntory action has been carried within the development and \nimplementation of these projects.\nMethod\nA protocol was written and registered before the study \n(10.17605/OSF.IO/9D25R) at https:// osf. io/ 9d25r [71].\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nA Population, Concept and Context (PCC) framework \n[72] was developed as the inclusion criteria (Table 1).\nThe study types included were relevant peer-reviewed \nand non-peer-reviewed primary interventions, second -\nary research, and relevant discussions (books, scholarly \narticles, discussion and opinion pieces, grey literature, \nnon-scientific interventions, reports, policy, and guid -\nance documents).\nThe 2010 data limitation was added to exclude obso -\nlete technologies with the aim that resulting discussions \nwould be reflective of current practice.\nSearch strategy\nThe search was conducted in English with no limits on \nfive academic databases. A search syntax combining key -\nwords and subject terms using Boolean operators was \ndeveloped with the support of a professional librarian \n(LC). The following concepts were searched: displaced \npopulation, digital health, localisation, and low, middle \nincome (Additional file  1: search syntax). The selected \ndatabases were CINAHL via EBSCO, Medline via Pub -\nMed, PsycINFO via OvidSP , Sociological Abstracts via \nProQuest and Web of Science Classic via Clarivate Ana -\nlytics. These databases were selected in collaboration \nwith a professional librarian (LC) to provide a multi-dis -\nciplinary life and behavioural science result. In addition, \nthree online grey literature repositories were searched \nusing the search terms; digital, local and health within \nthe International Committee of the Red Cross’s resource \nportal (ICRC) [73], Oxfam’s Open Library Repository \n[74] and the Active Learning Network for Accountabil -\nity and Performance’s resource portal (ALNAP) [75], to \nsource relevant publications. These repositories were \nselected by the lead author (JB) due to prior use and \nunderstanding of their relevant content according to the \nkey words. Other repositories were also considered for \ninclusion however the manual nature of the search and \nexport functions was timely, and a decision (JB & TB) \nwas made to limit their use to three. A Cochrane LMIC \nfilter [76] was applied to the academic databases, and \na date filter from 2010 onwards (final database search \nTable 1 PCC inclusion and exclusion criteria\nInclusion criteria Exclusion criteria\nPopulation: Humans of any demographic background that have been internally \nor internationally displaced following a humanitarian crisis (conflict, \ndisaster, outbreak, etc.)\nNon-human samples, economic migrants, expatriates, and other \nmigratory groups\nConcept: Digital health interventions, public health perspectives, participa-\ntory digital health methods, localisation & shifting power\nDigital interventions not associated with health outcomes, digital \ninterventions not applied (e.g., digital prototype development, \nnot conducted), digital interventions not used directly by displaced \npopulations (e.g., digital interventions used by clinical humanitarian/\nhealth responder\nContext: Low-and middle-income countries and contexts as defined \nby the World Bank [130] as the location displaced people find \nthemselves in seeking humanitarian assistance\nStudies not carried out in, or discussions not referring to low \nresource settings\nOther: Studies published in languages other than English that cannot be \nauto translated to English, full texts not accessible following exten-\nsive search efforts and literature published before 2010\nPage 5 of 19\nBenson et al. Conflict and Health  (2023) 17:20\n \ndate—29.09.2021 and final repository search date—\n09.11.2021) was applied to all searches.\nScreening and data extraction\nWe adopted the five-step approach as outlined by Ark -\nsey and O’Malley [77]; (1) identification of the research \nquestion, (2) identification of relevant studies which \nwere entered into EndNote20 and then imported into \nCovidence. Deduplication and study selection took place \nthrough (3) two levels of screening by two independ -\nent reviewers (JB and ML), title and abstract screening \nand full-text review resulting in 27 papers for inclusion. \nConflict resolution discussions were held to come to a \nconsensus on disagreements. (4) Microsoft Excel data \ncharting summarised all papers (Additional file  3: data \nchart) and centred around the literature characteris -\ntics, as outlined within the protocol [71]. This process \nwas subject to a quality control review by both review -\ners (JB & ML) independently at the extraction stage. (5) \nThe identification and charting of reported localisation \nand participatory action and associated emerging themes \nfollowed iteratively (JB and ML) as an extension of the \nmain chart to form the basis of the paper’s results sec -\ntion. Additional literature was drawn upon to further the \nteam’s comprehension and knowledge of key themes and \nto situate the paper within a broader body of literature. \nThis was cited throughout the paper but not charted \nwithin the literature table. The PRISMA 2020 check -\nlist guided the scoping study’s write-up [78] (Additional \nfile 5: PRISMA checklist).\nData synthesis and analysis\nThe review took a critical stance toward analysis through \nthe idea that reality is the product of language, social \nroles and forces of power [79, 80], grounded within prac-\ntical contexts rather than being developed in isolation \n[81–83], we identify the literature as steeped in power \ndynamics (interpretivism).\nWe borrowed from Molinengo’s Flows of Power Frame-\nwork [84] and define power as both acts and flows: “An \nact of power is the capacity of an actor to intervene at a \nspecific moment during a collaborative process, … accord -\ning to their own interests” [84] and “A flow of power is a \nchain of actions, originating from one initial act of power \n… that contribute to the ongoing interplay between \ndesigned and emerging interaction orders” [84].\nWithin the literature we looked for synergies and \nalignments with the Emerging Indicators of the Partici -\npation Revolution (see Additional file  6), as mentioned \nwithin the GMI Dimensions of Localisation Framework \n[45] and the Participation Key Performance Indicators \nwithin the NEAR Localisation Performance Measurement \nFramework [69] as a process of identifying how the Par -\nticipation Revolution has been enacted.\nWe applied Arnstein’s Ladder of Citizen Participation \nas a power lens [85] to interpret the extent of participa -\ntory action in the literature. We used Hilsdon et al. ’s criti-\ncal thinking model of description, analysis and evaluation \n[86, 87] to stimulate thinking, questioning and reflection \nto deconstruct and reconstruct meaning with this focus.\nReflexivity\nRecognising the privileged position of the research team \nin the interpretation of data and knowledge-making \nthrough the process of developing this paper, a reflexiv -\nity statement was drawn up. The aim of this was to pro -\nvide transparency and acknowledge the power dynamics \nwithin our identity and positionality that have impacted \nand enabled the production of this paper, along with our \ninterpretation of results (Additional file  4: Reflexivity \nstatement).\nResults\nOverview\nThe original literature search yielded 3199 papers, 1093 \nfrom academic databases, and 2106 from grey literature \nsources. 142 duplicates were removed, leaving 3057 (96%) \npapers for screening and selection. Application of the eli -\ngibility criteria at the first screening level excluded 2965 \npapers, and the second excluded 92 articles (Additional \nfile  2: PRISMA-ScR flowchart). The primary reasons \nfor exclusion at the second screening level were; wrong \nintervention (n = 45), lacking a health focus, and, or the \nwrong population, lacking a focus on displaced popu -\nlation groups in LMIC (n = 11). N = 27 eligible papers \nremained, and all were included in the review.\nLiterature and crisis characteristics\nThe literature provided a heterogeneous range of aca -\ndemic and grey literature focusing on digitalised humani-\ntarian health. 70% of the literature were peer-reviewed \nacademic papers (n = 19) (89–106), with the majority of \nthese being published within the last four years (addi -\ntional file 3: Data chart).\nMixed methodologies, such as, qualitative surveys, \nquantitative phone surveys, a cross-section study, a fea -\nsibility randomised control trial, and literature reviews \nwere all present. N = 13 papers were general papers with-\nout interventions.\nRefugees were the primary population of interest \n(n = 14). This is at odds with global displacement statis -\ntics outlining a greater number of internally displaced \npopulations (IDPs) in need of humanitarian assistance \n[4, 88]. There were 48 humanitarian contexts mentioned \nPage 6 of 19Benson et al. Conflict and Health  (2023) 17:20\nin total (Fig.  1), and several papers referred to more than \none crises. According to the World Bank economic clas -\nsifications n = 15 were low-income countries; n = 16 were \nlower-middle-income countries; n = 10 were upper-mid -\ndle-income-countries  (outlined in Table  2). Within the \nliterature, certain high-income contexts were included in \ncombination with relevant LMIC contexts (n = 7), with \nresults that were not always disaggregated by country.\nReflecting major humanitarian crises within the \nreview’s timeframe, African contexts (n = 20) were the \nmost frequently mentioned. However, in terms of inter -\nventions, Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries \n(Turkey: n = 6, Lebanon: n = 7, Jordan: n = 8) were the \nmost frequently assessed.\nThe majority of the literature focused upon conflict \ncrises, with the exception of one paper [89] that focused \non a natural disaster. The other papers discussed crises \nin general (n = 7). Displaced people and refugees were \nidentified in camps as well as within urban and rural \nhost populations. Further characteristics are charted in \nTable 2.\nDigital tools and health characteristics\nThe review identified a broad spectrum of digital health \ntools used within the humanitarian landscape, with sev -\neral papers citing more than one tool. The tools were \npredominantly orientated towards mobile phones, with \nphone age and type varying from very basic mobile \nphones with limited functionality to more modern \nsmartphones with a range of applications. Despite this, \nthe most frequently cited format were smartphone appli -\ncations (n = 5) [90–94] followed by short-messaging sys -\ntems (SMS) (n = 3) [95–97].\nTargeted or potential digital health users were parents \n(n = 1), women and girls (n = 2), mental health sufferers \n(n = 9) and NCD sufferers (n = 1). Digital health tools \nwere set to address a range of health issues through both \nguided and self-help approaches. Almost half of the lit -\nerature (n = 13) addressed specific health issues through \na vertical approach with health promotion, prepared -\nness, and planning, as well as responsive health man -\nagement interventions. The most frequently cited health \nissue was mental health (n = 9) [89, 93–95, 98–102], \nincluding depression, post-traumatic and psychological \nstress. Maternal, reproductive, and childcare (n = 3) [90, \n92, 103] followed: These interventions focused on fam -\nily planning and newborn vaccinations. Communicable \ndiseases, a common concern within humanitarian envi -\nronments [104], were identified in n = 3 papers [91, 97, \n105], focusing on Cholera, Covid-19 and other infectious \ndisease outbreaks. Despite the high non-communicable \ndisease (NCD) burden in LMIC [104], only one paper \naddressed NCDs with a focus on hypertension and diabe-\ntes [96] which may be reflective of the short term nature \nof humanitarian assistance. General health care followed \nthis (n = 1) [106], including first aid, health promotion, \nand gender-based violence prevention (n = 1) [107]. \nThere was no physical activity, nutrition interventions, or \ninterventions targeting obesity, tobacco and drug cessa -\ntion, or HIV/AIDS management that might be expected \nFig. 1 Humanitarian contexts focused on within literature, categorised by economic classification\nPage 7 of 19\nBenson et al.

Included papers \ntended to focus on understanding the digital land -\nscape through baseline and pre-intervention feasibil -\nity assessments. Self-reported results found widespread \ninfrastructure and access but intermittent connectivity \n(internet, electricity, network), with some areas having \nno coverage [92, 93, 95, 98, 100, 101, 107–110]. A high \ndigital device ownership was found, with mobile phones \nbeing the most frequently owned devices. Digital literacy \nlevels were limitedly explored and in some cases  digital \ndevice ownership may have been  conflated with digital \nliteracy [109].\nInterest, willingness and readiness to use newly intro -\nduced health tools were all self-reported as high [91–93, \n95, 96, 100, 107]. User perceptions of potential health \nimpacts through digital health tool use were assessed and \nreported positively. However, as one maternal care infor -\nmation study found, from 1042 participants, only 17% \nhad used the digital health tool by the end of the inter -\nvention [92].\nCost was a critical factor in influencing user behaviours \n[91–93, 95, 96, 100] and there were quality concerns for \ncontent accuracy and sufficient user literacy levels [93, \n100, 103, 107]. Social media, including Facebook, Face -\nbook Messenger and WhatsApp were frequently used by \nparticipants but not necessarily for health information.\nFindings were gendered in certain studies, with females \nbeing less likely to be digital owners than males. Addi -\ntionally, older generations, those without education or \nlow-income groups were less likely to own mobile phones \n[109]. Sharing behaviours broadened mobile phone user -\nship between family members and within friend circles. \nHowever, restrictions in shared device usage or usage \nmonitoring were reported at a low level, cited as a pro -\ntection mechanism to avoid shameful online behaviours \nor to avoid distractions during studies [107].\nParticipation within digital health tool projects\nAccording to the information provided, there were no \nexplicit localisation efforts within this review and it was \nTable 3 Digital tool and health and characteristics\nCharacteristic Types Literature reference\nHealth issues addressed Cholera [105, 111]\nCovid-19 [91]\nFirst aid [133]\nGender-based violence [107]\nGeneral health [133]\nHealth records [132]\nMalarial prevention/care [111]\nMaternal health/family planning [92, 103]\nMental health [98, 93–95, 98–102]\nNon-communicable diseases [137]\nVaccine-preventable diseases [90]\nUnspecified [26, 132, 108–112, 111, \n112, 133, 135]\nDigital tool Mobile phone\nSMS [95, 107, 137]\nApplication [90–94]\nMobile phone (Medium not specified) [100, 109, 112]\nGeneral\nTelephone line [99, 108, 89, 101, 102]\nSocial Media [98]\nUnspecified [26, 132, 103, 105, 110]\nMixed tools [124, 111, 133, 135]\nCloud-based storage systems [132, 101, 105, 97]\nPage 10 of 19Benson et al.

Localisation ter -\nminology such as empowerment language was limited \nbut identified in n = 6 papers [91, 103, 106, 108, 111, 112].\nParticipation was not a central theme in the literature. \nDisplaced people were not discussed as project partners \nor leaders of the digital interventions but as participants, \npatients and users. Furthermore, there was no mention of \nlocal groups involved in the conception of the interven -\ntions, their assessments, interpreting the results or prep -\naration of the literature.\nInstead of critical decision-makers and response lead -\ners, displaced and crisis affected people were relegated \nto participation through answering surveys, responding \nto interviews and partaking in focus group discussions \n(FGDs) [92–96, 98, 100, 107–110]. Outside of these roles, \ndisplaced people acted as translators, interviewers [95] \nand site surveyors [98]. One paper [93] acknowledged \nthat “user experience focus is still rare”, another stated \n“no participants were involved in the development of the \nresearch questions or outcome measures or the design and \nconduct of this study” [92]. Despite their limited involve -\nment, n = 23 (85%) papers anecdotally recognised the \nbenefit of local participation to improve intervention \noutcomes, citing it as a recommendation or as a lesson \nlearned.\nResults from participation activities were reported but \nwithout great attention which challenged the analysis \nof power within or surrounding them. Their gap in the \nliterature is conspicuous and steeped in power inequi -\nties. Digital health tools were adapted [93] to benefit \ndisplaced people through functional and content modi -\nfications: These were motivated by user feedback on \ncomprehension and relevance which were said to build \nprovider credibility and trust. Participation raised the \nissue of user literacy levels, with one intervention team \nbeing requested to read their survey out loud to 70% of \nrespondents [98].\nFurthermore, a discussion theme focused upon con -\nstruction of health and wellness concepts and how \nlanguage was used, particularly in relation to cultural \ninfluences and displacement contextualisation was \npresent. Here the importance of capturing context \nand cultural idioms and their gendered reality within \nhealth constructions, and handling stigmatised health \nissues with cultural consideration to avoid insensi -\ntive approaches [100] was outlined. These discussions \nincluded the importance of tone and accent in language \n[107] and not simply the language selection itself as hav -\ning an impact on provider-recipient interactions. One \npaper said of diverse humanitarian communities “dif -\nferences across contexts are significant enough to affect \npopulation level behaviour and epidemiology” [91]. These \ndiscussions are integral to the success of digital health \nbut remained limited within the review as a whole.\nAuthorship\nLMIC authorship was limited (Fig.  2). According to the \nWorld Bank economic classifications [113], only one \nFig. 2 Authorship affiliations within the literature, categorised by economic classification\nPage 11 of 19\nBenson et al. Conflict and Health  (2023) 17:20\n \npaper had authorship affiliations from a low-income \ncountry (LIC) [Bangladesh [99]]. Six upper-middle-\nincome authorship affiliations countries (UMIC) were \npresent [India, Jordan, Lebanon, Peru, South Africa, and \nTurkey]. N = 15 authorship affiliations from HIC coun -\ntries were present, including organisations or institutions \nbased within HIC (4 of these did not explicitly state the \nauthorship country and were written by international \norganisations; two from UNHCR, one from UN OCHA \nand one from Samuel Hall). While it is possible that dis -\nplaced diaspora from LMIC contributed to the literature’s \nHIC authorship, there was no reflexivity in this respect.\nDiscussion\nPrinciple findings\nThe objective of this study has been to explore digital \nhealth tools used in humanitarian environments by dis -\nplaced people, their purpose and how they have localised \ntheir work through the participation tenet. To our knowl-\nedge, this is the first review of its kind focusing on this \ntopic. It contributes knowledge in the arena of localisa -\ntion and participation within digitalised health inter -\nventions for displaced people in LMIC. Main findings \ninclude a varied range of digital tools addressing a variety \nof health issues. Largely, these tools were developed with \nlimited engagement of displaced people to achieve pre-\ndetermined objectives and without consideration of the \nParticipation Revolution indicators. Intervention assess -\nments in this digital realm appears to be in its infancy \nand not yet at the stage of evidencing health outcomes. \nGreater engagement with digital tool users at all project \nstages should be a key focus for digital health projects \ndelivering humanitarian and health action.\nDigitalised humanitarianism\nThe humanitarian landscape is becoming increasingly \ndigitalised. Despite being a western construct, “the devel-\nopment of mobile phone networks in LMIC has even \nsuperseded infrastructure development of roads, electric -\nity and traditional internet deployment” [100]. The het -\nerogeny of health issues and digital tools found within \nthis review reflects other relevant reviews and echoes the \nfast-paced development, cost and ubiquity of innovative \nmobile technologies [95, 114, 115]. With two exceptions \n[91, 92] mobile phones were not found to be a current \nsource of health information, however their ubiquity for \nmany displaced people could signal positive implica -\ntions for future digital health tools in their use as a health \nsource.\nDigital divide\nDespite their ubiquity, it remains unclear if digital \nhealth tools actually extend the reach of humanitarian \nhealth services. Interventions occurred around estab -\nlished health centres and camp catchment areas, with \nparticipants being recruited from within. Whilst the \nremote nature of digital health tools has the potential \nto benefit hard-to-reach groups such as the physically \nimpaired or excluded groups without existing access, \nthere was a gap in the literature here. This left unan -\nswered questions on whether these participants, with \nready access to health centres and high mobile phone \nownership, are in fact the most vulnerable.\nThe gendered and nuanced reality of the digital divide  \n[116] highlights the existing inequalities in accessing \nhealth care: Low mobile phone ownership among cer -\ntain groups of women, low literacy skills among the \npoorly educated, prohibitively expensive data costs for \nthe unemployed or low-income groups, and poor con -\nnectivity infrastructure for rurally located communities \nall sets to exclude these groups from the benefits digital \nhealth tools may offer. The inequitable and intermit -\ntent digital landscape, alongside varying literacy levels, \nTable 4 Literature authorship origin, categorised by economic \nclassification\nCountry of authorship Literature reference\nLow-income countries\n Bangladesh [99]\nUpper-middle-income-countries\n India [99]\n Jordan [90, 103, 138]\n Lebanon [132, 108, 124, 94, 103, 96]\n Peru [102]\n Turkey [91, 107]\n South Africa [95]\nHigh-income-countries\n Australia [108, 107]\n Canada [96]\n France [107]\n Germany [93, 94]\n Japan [92]\n Sweden [108, 90]\n Switzerland [93, 94]\n The Netherlands [93, 94]\n UK [108, 124, 110–112, 112]\n USA [132, 100, 89, 101, \n100–102, 105, 102, 96]\n United Arab Emirates [96]\nUnspecified authorship location (international organisations)\n IFRC [133]\n Samuel Hall [109]\n OCHA [26]\n UNHCR [134, 135]\nPage 12 of 19Benson et al. Conflict and Health  (2023) 17:20\nis a critical threat to the success of digital health tools \nwithin LMIC contexts. This divide was reiterated by the \nUN Secretary-General in 2020, describing it as “a mat-\nter of life or death” [ 117] and this review has not pro -\nvided evidence transcending these challenges (Table 4 ).\nIntervention outputs\nThe majority of intervention literature focused on the \nfeasibility of digital health tools, rather than testing them \nas a disease prevention or health promotion tool. Map -\nping the digital landscape and understanding connectiv -\nity barriers are acknowledged as fundamental pillars for \nthe success of digital health. However, there is a critical \nknowledge gap of digital health tools improving health \noutcomes. It is recognised that research in humanitar -\nian contexts is challenging, but as improving health out -\ncomes is the digital health raison d’être, this should be \na primary driver for developing digital health tools. The \ncurrent focus of the digital health movement indicates \nits formative stage and has some way to go before digital \nhealth outcomes can be evidenced.\nWhilst health outcomes within digital health are under-\nresearched, the literature offers a range of consistently \npositive results indicating that displaced populations are \nboth interested and willing to use digital tools. However, \nmuch of the research findings hinge on short-term, self-\nreported, unverified data with varying sample sizes and \nfollow-up efforts. Potential response and social desirabil -\nity biases were highlighted [96, 107] but not addressed \nwith the literature and risk undermining these formative \nassessments. As one study demonstrated, the presence \nand knowledge of digital health tools are not enough to \nmotivate their uptake [92]. As a relatively novel sphere \nof humanitarian health action, further research verify -\ning these self-reports and addressing biases is an essential \nstep to strengthening research in this field.\nAuthorship reflexivity\nThough localisation debates have been criticised for \npolarising an international-local binary that fails to rec -\nognise the hybridity and diversity of contemporary \nhumanitarian and health action [118–120], identifying \ndominant voices within the literature can reveal prevail -\ning positionality and associated power structures. Within \nthe literature, several papers included direct quotes from \ndisplaced people, extending their voices to the reader. \nHowever, the dominance of HIC authorship within this \nreview exposes the prevalence of knowledge-makers \nforming narratives through their positionality in inter -\npreting study results with limited reflexivity.\nIt is possible that LMIC displaced diaspora may have \nbeen included alongside HIC researchers or implemen -\ntation teams, however, there is little explicit evidence of \nthis. This lack of attention towards positionality is prob -\nlematic in that the international narrative here, whilst \ndominant, may not be genuinely representative of dis -\nplaced people within LMIC. Addressing the positional -\nity of this paper, the authorship team are from HIC and \nhave not been personally affected by humanitarian crises. \nWe recognise our prevailing perspective on this topic \n(Additional file  4: reflexivity statement) as a limitation \nin getting to the heart of localisation from the perspec -\ntive of displaced people in LMIC. Nevertheless, we use \nour power to direct attention to this critical point and to \nencourage LMIC voices on this topic.\nParticipation in digital health tool projects\nThere is an almost-universal acceptance amongst the \nhumanitarian community that localisation and participa -\ntion are positive steps towards improving response  effi -\nciency. Anderson et  al. ’s book, Time to listen: hearing \npeople on the receiving end of international aid [121], \nreflects this with aspirations for a humanitarian system \nthat moves away from crisis-affected people as passive \naid recipients and towards a broader collaborative expe -\nrience. This was echoed within the literature’s narrative \nas advantageous for developing relevant, credible digital \nhealth tools. However, the reality of this activity within \nthe literature was either not present or contained. Char -\nacterised by Arnstein as “an empty ritual”, [53], local \ngroups and individuals tended to be used as instruments \nof the research teams for the purpose of extrapolating \ninformation for pre-defined questions, seeking to explore \npre-determined objectives including informing adapta -\ntions and functional modifications rather than leading \nactors, co-creators or partners within their response. The \nParticipation Revolution, according to NEAR and GMI \nindicators has yet to emerge.\nIntervention literature tended to be short-term, char -\nacteristic of rapid humanitarian responses with lim -\nited discussion of sustainable, integrated solutions. As a \nresult, participatory action appeared as the intermittent \ninvolvement of small participant groups conducted by \nresearch teams. Little is written regarding the represent -\nability of these groups with the proposed digital health \nusers or the wider crisis affected population, or the inclu-\nsion and exclusion criteria for their selection, how they \nwere selected or whether they received remittance for \ntheir participation. Others reflected this with similar \nexperiences of anecdotal or minimal involvement of dis -\nplaced people, primarily centred around providing local \nknowledge and language skills to inform already pre-\ndetermined interventions [122, 123]. Bowsher’s systemic \nreview [124] outlined that displaced people are usually \nexcluded from digital innovation development which fails \nto maximise on the potential of digital tools. Scholarly \nPage 13 of 19\nBenson et al. Conflict and Health  (2023) 17:20\n \nreflection in this area would be helpful and could provide \nevidence of representability as a quality indicator within \nintervention studies.\nApplying Arnstein’s Ladder of Citizen Participation \n[53], we can explore the extent of participatory activity. \nWithin this review participatory action ranges from the \nvery bottom of the ladder, with one paper outlined zero \nparticipatory efforts, and moving up to the second group, \nthe ‘degrees of tokenism’ realm. This includes information \nprovision, placation, and consultation [53]. Participa -\ntory action here can be characterised as singular flows \nof communication offering little feedback or influenc -\ning power. Consultations were measured as “statistical \nabstractions” [53] in number of surveys completed or \nnumber of downloads. As Arnstein outlines at this level, \ntargeted groups participated but did not necessarily ben -\nefit from their involvement, they could not influence digi-\ntal health action past the extent offered by those holding \nthe power [53].\nWhilst none of the literature claims to enact localisa -\ntion action, the absence of meaningful local contributions \nto digital health development indicates ongoing asym -\nmetrical power relations within the humanitarian and \nhealth systems remain as prevalent as ever. Reflecting \nupon this gap highlights the current system’s inequities. \nWithout meaningful, representative, on-going participa -\ntion from displaced people directly at all stages of inter -\nventions, the humanitarian community perpetuates a \nthem and us  narrative that risks characterising them as \npassive victims and beneficiaries without agency, capac -\nity, or self-determination. This ‘othering’ may marginalise \nor harm them [125] and have exclusionary implications \nfor the future of humanitarian and health action.\nIt is recognised that research and interventions in \nhumanitarian environments can be challenging and pro -\nhibit regular and deep engagement with displaced peo -\nple. Participatory action takes time, money, and energy to \nundertake which is often in short supply within humani -\ntarian emergencies. However, findings from a 2020 \nProfessionals in Humanitarian Assistance and Protec -\ntion workshop [126] with 541 practitioners and experts \nexploring inclusive participatory humanitarian action \nilluminated that the leading barrier was donor pressures \nand donor inflexibility alongside time constraints (43%) \nand the greatest facilitator was staff commitment (57.7%) \nand staff capacity (41.6%) [126]. These indicators could \nbecome key advocacy agendas for future participation \nchampions.\nThe problematic conceptions of localisation\nThe general and technocratic conceptualisation of locali -\nsation enables varied systemic manifestations to evolve \nwithin the humanitarian sphere. Rather than placing \ndisplaced people at the centre of the action, the localisa -\ntion dimensions risk becoming organisational tick-boxes \nthat can be achieved through superficial exercises in their \nname. This facilitates certain self-serving appropriations \nof participatory action that suits domineering health and \nhumanitarian actors, their modus operandi [102] and \nmaintains the status quo.\nThe lack of meaningful engagement with displaced \npopulations in digital health projects opens them up to \nthe risk of instrumentalising techno-colonialism [127]. \nMadianou defines techno-colonialism as the embedded \npower disparities between humanitarian organisations \nand crisis-affected people encapsulated within digital \ntools [127]. Within the participation sphere, the domi -\nnance of HIC narrative found within the literature of this \nreview appears to be primarily underpinned by western \nvalues from prominent nations and LMIC voices are \nrarely heard. The limited focus on selected health mod -\nels and conceptualisations of health and wellness within \nthese tools highlight tension with the principles of inde -\npendence and impartiality that humanitarianism suppos -\nedly enshrines.\nWhilst the Western World of health brings with it \nsome examples of globally renowned practices and poli -\ncies, these are not always appropriate or appreciated \noutside their context. Adopting western health mod -\nels within digital tools for LMIC is therefore potentially \nproblematic. Firstly, this reflects colonial practices of roll-\ning out western influence at the expense of local people. \nSecondly, western ideals do not always translate well with \ndiffering contexts and do not always align with cultural \nbeliefs underpinning illness and disease health constructs \nor routes of health care. Cultural and gender influences \nwere addressed in several papers, but this was not widely \nrepresentative of the literature’s consciousness. Further \nand more meaningful involvement with local groups \ncould be the key to re-conceptualising the models of \nhealth adopted within digital tools. Without this, digital \nhealth tools may reproduce inappropriate health con -\nstructions rather improve health according to grounded \nhealth and wellness realities [128] in LMIC.\nImplications\nDigital health as a humanitarian modality of assistance \nhas potential but the digital divide factors cannot be \noverstated as risks that may exclude and discrimina -\ntion against certain groups. Formative digital health \nresearch has been carried out, but this field remains in its \ninfancy. Research into the potential of improving health \noutcomes remains a crucial gap and more evidence is \nneeded in this regard. Existing scholarship remains dom -\ninated by HIC narratives and may not truly represent \nPage 14 of 19Benson et al. Conflict and Health  (2023) 17:20\nLMIC thinking. Current participatory action is limited \nand under-reported and more attention is required to \nachieve deeper, representative participatory activities \nare needed to move past the ‘them’ and ‘us’ positionality. \nWithout this, digital health interventions risk perpetu -\nating techno-colonialism through pervasive biases and \ninjustices. Without participation, digital health tools risk \nbeing perceived by their users as irrelevant, culturally \ninsensitive, untrusted, and unused. Participation should \nbe advocated for with donors and embedded within staff  \nconsciousness and skill sets.\nLimitations\nThough every effort was made to produce a rigorous and \ncomprehensive scoping review, we recognise several limi-\ntations within our labours. Firstly, the literature search \nwas challenging as the concept terms ‘digital health’ and \n‘localisation’ are not uniformly applied and understood \nconsistently within scholarship. Therefore, searching for \nthese terms alongside their synonyms may have inad -\nvertently omitted relevant literature that used alternative \nterminology. Additionally, though refugee vocabulary is \nwell articulated through the 1951 Refugee Convention, \nthe definition of IDPs is much less well understood and \napplied. As a result, it may be applied broadly to include \neconomic migrants, transitionary groups, and others. \nWhilst every effort was taken to include only forcibly dis -\nplaced people as a result of crises; it is possible that some \nliterature was included or excluded incorrectly based on \nthe terminology used by the research team.\nSecondly, our paper is based upon the presupposition \nthat localisation is a positive phenomenon and is benefi -\ncial to displaced groups following crises. Though existing \nscholarship supports this, localisation remains under-\nconceptualised and theorised, and we cannot claim our \npresupposition to be true. Further research should be \ncarried out to characterise further and assess localisation \nand its desirability within humanitarian crises.\nThirdly, we limited our research scope to displaced pop-\nulations within LMIC. We did this because this reflects \nthe reality of where displaced populations are primarily \nlocated, either internally or internationally, at the time of \nwriting. However, some literature covered interventions \nwithin LMIC and HIC and presented data cumulatively. \nWhilst care was taken to review and analyse only data from \nLMIC contexts; this was not possible in some cases. As a \nresult, all data may not be wholly representative of LMIC.\nFourthly, a limitation of the scoping study model is \nthat it does not seek to appraise the quality of the inter -\nventions included within it. The interventions included \nin this review varied in size, scale and type. Participant \nnumbers were generally low, and where there was follow-\nup time, it was often short-term, with much of the data \nbeing self-reported, which risks introducing a number of \nbiases. Whilst we recognise that research within humani-\ntarian contexts comes with a range of ethical and practi -\ncal challenges, it cannot be overlooked that data arising \nfrom these interventions may not be wholly reflective of \nrapidly evolving crisis landscapes, and future research \nshould consider this.\nFinally, we recognise discussions of vulnerable groups \nbenefit from their participation at all stages so that they \nare fully represented. Decolonisation debates support \nthis to shift the crisis narrative away from that of victims \nand passive aid recipients and reframe them as actors \ncapable of leading their own response. Echoing the UN \nSecretary General’s words that humanitarian responses \nshould be “as local as possible and as international as \nnecessary” [42], we aim, through this paper, to highlight \nour reflexivity to it. We intend to use our international \npositionality as a mechanism to make space and draw \nfurther resources and recognition for local groups in \nLMIC to take up this role for themselves.\nConclusion\nThis scoping review provides critical insight into how the \nlocalisation phenomenon currently manifests as partici -\npatory action at the crisis level within digitalised health \ninterventions for displaced people in LMIC, as laid out \nin scholarly literature. With growing numbers of dis -\nplaced people globally, addressing their health needs is \nan important issue, with increasing pressure on humani -\ntarian and health actors to use innovative approaches to \naddress this. The theory of digitalisation to address these \nhealth burdens is an exciting prospect, but humanitar -\nian health communities have an ethical imperative to act \nwithout causing harm and underpin their approaches \nwith evidence [105]. This review found a conspicuous gap \nhere. Despite this incomplete picture and the nuanced \ndigital dividing factors, the literature did attest to dis -\nplaced populations’ interest and willingness to use digital \nhealth tools. However, limited practice did not support \nthese outcomes and further investigations into potential \nbiases is required here.\nHIC authorship predominantly constructed the nar -\nrative within the reviewed literature, with an absence \nof reflexivity. This reflects the current power dynamics \nand structural inequalities within the global humanitar -\nian and health systems. This was exemplified by limited \nparticipation in digital health circles, which risks techno-\ncolonialism in maintaining the systemic status quo. The \nlocalisation agenda has not yet achieved its paradigm \nshift of power. Further research is required into its con -\nceptualisation, intersectional spheres, and application \nwithin a diverse LMIC landscape to achieve long-lasting \noutcomes.\nPage 15 of 19\nBenson et al. Conflict and Health  (2023) 17:20\n \nWith protracted displacement becoming ever more \nprevalent, UNHCR suggests as many as 31 people are \ndisplaced per minute [129], the importance of finding \nlong-term, dynamic solutions to address their health \nin a meaningful way has become more crucial than \never. To do this, international actors should lean back \nand make space for and promote participation as one \ndimension of a broader, intersectional movement to \nshift power for long-lasting impact.\nAbbreviations\nA4EP  Alliance for Empowering Partnerships\nALNAP  Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance\nC4C  Charter for Change\nCHS  Core Humanitarian Standard\nCovid-19  Coronavirus Disease 2019\nFGDs  Focus group discussion/s\nGMI  Global Mentoring Initiative\nGPS  Global Positioning System\nHIC  High-income country/ies\nHIV/AIDS  Human Immunodeficiency Virus/ Acquired Immunodeficiency \nSyndrome\nHP  Humanitarian Principles\nICRC   International Committee of the Red Cross\nIDPs  Internally displaced population/s\nIHL  International Humanitarian Law\nLIC  Low-income-country/ies\nLMIC  Low-and-middle-income-country/ies\nMENA  The Middle East and North Africa\nNEAR  Network for Empowered Aid Response\nNCD  Non-communicable disease/s\nPCC  Population, Concept, Context\nPRISMA  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and \nMeta-Analyses\nPRISMA-ScR  PRISMA extension for scoping reviews\nSDG  Sustainable Development Goals\nSMS  Short Messaging System\nUMIC  Upper-middle-income country/ies\nUN  United Nations\nUN OCHA  United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \nAffairs\nUNHCR  United Nations High Commission for Refugees\nUSA  United States of America\nWHS  World Humanitarian Summit (2016)\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. \norg/ 10. 1186/ s13031- 023- 00518-9.\nAdditional file 1.
