Introduction\nHigh power density power converters are required in sev-\neral industry applications such as: automotive, military,\naerospace, renewable energies, computer power systems, in-\nter alia (1)–(10). Particularly, downsizing magnetic components\nsuch as transformers and inductors is important because they\ntend to occupy a signiﬁcant percentage of the full volume and\nweight in the power converters. In addition, the demand of\nbase metals (Fe, Al, Cu, etc.) and rare metals (Ni, Mn, Co\netc.) that are used in magnetic cores will be raised because of\nthe world economic growing. Therefore, it is probable that\nthe price of these resources will be increased because of their\nlack in the near future\n(11) (12). In this way, downsizing magnetic\ncores and saving metal resources are signiﬁcantly important.\nIn this context, in downsizing methods for power convert-\ners, interleaved topology is well known as one of the con-\nverter types that can achieve higher power density in compar-\nison with conventional topologies\n(13). This method presents\nthe advantages of high frequency current operation of the\noutput smoothing capacitor, attenuation of EMI contents and\nreduction of ﬁlter size\n(14)–(18). However, interleaved topology\nrequires many magnetic devices in proportion to the num-\nber of phases. Thus, this method is not eﬀ ective for down-\nsizing the magnetic components. Consequently, integrated\nmagnetic components have been applied to power converter\nincluding isolated, non-isolated DC-DC converters and PFC\nconverters\n(19)–(26).\nThese integrated magnetic components consist of multi-\nple windings on a single magnetic core, where it is pos-\nsible to share the magnetic ﬂux, contributing to downsize\nthe magnetic components. Additionally, due to the mutual\n∗Shimane University\n1060, Nishikawatsu, Matsue, Shimane 690-8504, Japan\ninduction, inductor ripple current operates at a higher fre-\nquency in comparison with single phase converters (1)–(3) (10) (22).\nMoreover, some references describe interleaved boost con-\nverter proposing diﬀerent design methods for coupled induc-\ntors that achieve high power density performance in power\nconversion systems\n(1)–(4) (10) (25) (26). In these previous studies,\ncoupled inductors with high coupling coe ﬃcient are e ﬀec-\ntive for downsizing because the DC ﬂux can be cancelled and\ninductor ripple current operates at a higher frequency. How-\never, coupled inductors with high coupling coe ﬃcient using\nEE or EI cores present diﬃculties in design and manufacture,\nbecause of the fringing eﬀect, which is generated at the air\ngap part of the mentioned cores\n(1) (26) (28). In addition, a coupled\ninductor with a large air gap causes additional winding losses\ndue to fringing ﬂux near the air-gap. Fringe ﬁeld wreaks eddy\ncurrents in the windings when it tries to penetrate the wind-\nings, and causes deterioration of the power conversion e ﬃ-\nciency\n(29) (30). Hence, improvement of inductor core structures\nis necessary in order to achieve a high coupling coe ﬃcient\nand high eﬃciency.\nThis paper presents a novel integrated magnetic structure\nwhich can suppress fringing ﬂuxes in the air gap and achieve\na high coupling coeﬃcient. This proposed structure can also\nobtain an optional leakage inductance with only a short air\ngap length. In this way, the analysis and design method for\nthe coupled inductor with the novel magnetic core structure\nis also introduced on the basis of a magnetic circuit model.\nFinally, the validation of the design method for the proposed\ncoupled inductor and the fringing ﬂux reduction is discussed\non the basis of an experimental setup.\n2. Transformer-linked Interleaved Boost Chop-\nper Circuit with Coupled Inductor\n2.1 Circuit Topology The interleaved boost chopper\ncircuit with a coupled inductor is shown in Fig. 1.

Conventional coupled inductor with E-E core\nand Vo are the input and output voltages, respectively. Co\nis the output smoothing capacitor. Lc1 and Lc2 are the self-\ninductances of each phase. Mc is the mutual inductance be-\ntween the windings. The switches S 1 and S2 are switched\nwith a 180◦phase shift, and operate with the same duty ratio.\nDue to the interleaved technique, this converter can reduce\nthe ripple voltage of the smoothing capacitor Co, compared\nto a single phase boost converter (14) (15). Additionally, the pro-\nposed circuit can reduce the current stress of power devices,\nS1,S 2,D 1 and D2 because the input current is divided into\ntwo phases without using power devices with high current\nrating. Moreover, coupled inductor enables the integration\nof magnetic components into only one assembly, where each\nphase inductor currenti\n1 and i2 operates at a higher frequency\nbecause of the eﬀect of mutual induction. From these fea-\ntures, the miniaturization of the whole converter and the low\ncost of the magnetic components are achieved.\n2.2 Inconvenient of EE and EI Core Structures for\nCoupled Inductors First of all, it is necessary to exam-\nine the conventional structure of a coupled inductor and its\ncomplications. A conventional coupled inductor, shown in\nFig. 2(a), is composed of leakage inductors and a transformer.\nAnd also, an only air gap in the coupled inductor is located\nin the center leg in order to obtain a high mutual inductance.\nDue to the core structure, two advantages are provided: First,\nthe magnetizing current in the transformer hardly ﬂows due\nto the higher mutual inductance. In this case, the inductor rip-\nple current becomes almost completely twice the frequency\nas compared to single-phase boost converter\n(26). And second,\nthe DC ﬂux is almost canceled by high coupling (2).F r o m\nthese features, this core structure is e ﬀective for downsizing\nthe magnetic components in the proposed circuit.\nHowever, taking into account the coupled inductor shown\nin Table 1 where a coupled inductor with two windings and an\nair gap was made on the basis of reference (27), it is possible\nTable 1. Problem of conventional magnetic core structure\nFig. 3. The magnetic ﬁeld simulation result\nto infer that the implementation of this type of core struc-\nture causes some inconvenient. These inductance values are\nmeasured by HIOKI 3522 LCR HiTESTER, and the mea-\nsured frequency is 50 kHz. The measurement procedure of\nthe inductance is shown in the Sect. 1 of the appendix. As\nseen in Table 1, the designed and measured inductance val-\nues were similar. The small diﬀerence between the designed\nand measured value of the mutual inductance occurs by an\nerror between the designed and measured value of the mag-\nnetic reluctance in outer leg. In addition, this error appears\ndue to a tiny air gap at the junction of cores, although there is\nno deliberate air gap in the outer leg.\nHowever, there is a more serious problem, and it is that\nthe needed air gap lengths are quite diﬀerent: 1.75 mm in the\ndesign and 26.6 mm in the experimental case. This problem\ngenerates complications of the magnetic design and increases\nwinding losses due to fringing e ﬀect. Additionally, it is dif-\nﬁcult to achieve high coupling in the case of the structure\nwith EE or EI cores. In fact, since it is not possible to adjust\nthe coupling coeﬃcient, there is a case that cannot be created\na coupled inductor\n(28). Therefore, magnetic core structures\nwhich can increase the coupling coeﬃcient are required.\nFirst of all, the cause which is not possible to improve the\ncoupling coeﬃcient is investigated by a magnetic ﬁeld sim-\nulation in the case of conventional structure. The result is\nshown in Fig. 3. As seen in this ﬁgure, it is clear that there\nare two causes: First, external leakage ﬂuxes of the winding\ninﬂuence the inability to achieve a high coupling coe ﬃcient.\nThe amount of external leakage ﬂux has been known that is\nto be related to the winding arrangement, and split-winding\n396 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.3, No.5, 2014\nA Integrated Magnetic Core Structure for Interleaved ConvertersʢJun Imaoka et al.ʣ\nTable 2. Relationship between magnetic core structures and coupling coe ﬃcient\nmethod or uniformly windings in the outer leg of the cores,\nlike toroid inductors have been well known as methods for\nreducing the external leakage ﬂux\n(1) (31).\nSecondly, the fringing ﬂux at the air gap is also taken as\na one of these causes, as seen in Fig. 3. From a theoretical\nviewpoint, the mechanism which cannot improve the cou-\npling coeﬃcient by fringing ﬂux is described as follows.\nFrom the magnetic circuit model shown in Fig. 2(b), each\ninductance of the conventional coupled inductor is given by:\n(In this magnetic circuit model, the external leakage paths\nare omitted because they are aﬀected by the winding arrange-\nment)\nL\nc =N2 · Rmo +Rmc\nR2mo +2 ·Rmo ·Rmc\nMc =N2 · Rmc\nR2mo +2 ·Rmo ·Rmc\n·················· (1)\nLlk =Lc −Mc =N2 · 1\nRmo +2 ·Rmc\nWhere, Rmo and Rmc are magnetic reluctance in the outer\nleg and the center leg. N1 and N2 are the number of winding\nturns, and are the same in each phase. From Eq. (1), coupling\ncoeﬃcient, k, is given by:\nk =Mc\nLc\n= Rmc\nRmo +Rmc\n··························· (2)\nIn addition, Rmc is expressed by the following from a geo-\nmetrical viewpoint:\nRmc = lc −lg\nμr ·μ0 ·Ac\n+ lg\nμ0 ·Ag\n····················· (3)\nIf the fringing eﬀect is ignored, Rmc is given by:\nRmc\n ig = lc −lg\nμr ·μ0 ·Ac\n+ lg\nμ0 ·Ac\n··················· (4)\nIn Eqs. (3)∼(4), lc and Ac are the magnetic path length of\nthe center leg and sectional area of the center leg, respec-\ntively. μr and μ0 are relative and space permeability, lg and\nAg are the air gap length and eﬀective cross-sectional area of\nthe air gap, respectively (see Fig. 2(c) and Fig. 3).\nHere, the designed value of the air gap in Table 1 is de-\nsigned on the basis of the Eq. (4). In this way, there is an\nerror with the measured value because of ignoring the fring-\ning eﬀect.\nFrom Eq. (3), even if there is a long air gap l\ng in the center\nleg, Rmc does not increase by expanding sectional area Ag in\nthe air gap. In other words, lots of magnetic ﬂux leaks on\nthis magnetic path without crossing the other winding due to\nlow magnetic reluctance Rmc. Therefore, a large air gap is\nrequired in the center leg for increasing magnetic reluctance\nRmc. A sam a t t e ro ff a c t ,a ne r r o ro fl e n g t ho fa i rg a pi nT a -\nble 1 is also included inﬂuence of the external leakage ﬂux of\nwindings.\nFrom another viewpoint, coupling coe ﬃcient is repre-\nsented by the ratio of magnetic reluctances in the core, as\nshown in Eq. (2). Although R\nmo presents a low value because\nthe air gap is not present in the outer leg, it takes a ﬁnite value.\nTherefore, the maximum coupling coe ﬃcient value depends\non the minimum R\nmo values, or the relative permeability of\nmagnetic materials or the magnetic core structure.\nAs a conclusion, it was possible to corroborate that the\ncauses that cannot allow a high coupling coe ﬃcient are the\nexternal leakage ﬂux of the inductor windings and the fring-\ning ﬂux at the air gap.\nThen, the relationship between the coupling coeﬃcient and\nthe magnetic core structure is studied. Table 2 shows the re-\nlationship between three di ﬀerent core structures and their\ncoupling coe ﬃcients (Another case of the loosely coupled\ninductor is shown in Sect. 3 of the Appendix). In the case of\nthe loosely coupled structure with EE or EI cores, the max-\nimum coupling coeﬃcient is close to 0.95. Therefore, if the\ncoupling coeﬃcient reaches its maximum value, the design-\ners of the coupled inductor have to make an air gap at the\ntransformer part as shown in Fig. 2(a) in order to obtain the\ndesigned leakage inductance. However, this design method\ncomes up against the problem that the magnetizing current of\nthe transformer increases. This is because the mutual induc-\ntance is fairly decreased\n(1) (10). By contrast, the coupling coef-\nﬁcient is about 0.98 to 0.999 in the case of the close-coupled\ninductor structure shown in Table 2. In this context, there is\na great constraint due to the designed leakage inductance is\nnot obtained because the desired structure does not permit it.\nAccordingly, there is no structure which has coupling coeﬃ-\ncients between 0.95∼0.98 in case of EC90 cores.\n2.3 A Novel Integrated Magnetic Structure In this\nsection, a novel integrated magnetic core structure suitable\nfor coupled inductors which can achieve a high coupling co-\neﬃcient are proposed. Considering the circumstances men-\ntioned above, a novel integrated magnetic structure, shown\nin Fig. 4, is introduced in order to miniaturize the cross-\nsectional area A\ng for obtaining a higher coupling. The pro-\nposed structure is composed of two E typed and one I typed\ncores. The windings on the “winding” leg are inversely cou-\npled as shown in Fig. 4.\nAs attractive features of the novel magnetic core struc-\nture: it is possible to mention that the proposed structure can\nachieve a high coupling coe ﬃcient and obtain an optional\n397 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.3, No.5, 2014\nA Integrated Magnetic Core Structure for Interleaved ConvertersʢJun Imaoka et al.ʣ\nFig. 4. Proposed magnetic core structure (E-I-E core)\nFig. 5. Aim of proposed magnetic core structure\nleakage inductance without a large air gap. In addition, it\nis not possible to a ﬀect the external leakage ﬂux to the pe-\nripheral circuits as compared to the conventional structure\nbecause it is covered in the both sides of magnetic core.\nThe aim of this structure is shown in Fig. 5. This structure\ncan achieve the miniaturization of the sectional areaA\ng in the\nair gap by shortening the distance between each phase wind-\ning, x. By this core structure, the fringing ﬂux can be sup-\npressed by adjusting the distance between each phase wind-\ning. If the maximum coupling coeﬃcient of the conventional\nstructure is saturated, the novel core structure is useful, and\nthe magnetizing current in the transformer hardly ﬂows be-\ncause of the presence of a high mutual inductance.\n3. Modeling and Design of Novel Coupled Induc-\ntor\n3.1 Modeling for Novel Coupled Inductor In order\nto design the novel coupled inductor, detailed characteristics\nanalysis is required. It is needed a magnetic circuit model\nfor the electromagnetic analysis. Hence, a magnetic cir-\ncuit model for the novel coupled inductor is shown in Fig. 6.\nWhere, R\nmo, Rmc and Rmw are magnetic reluctances of each\nleg, respectively. φ1, φ2 and φc are the magnetic ﬂuxes of\neach phase in the winding leg, and the magnetic ﬂux in the\ncenter leg, respectively. This magnetic circuit model is the\nequivalent model of the proposed coupled inductor in Fig. 4.\nHowever, this model has several magnetic reluctance com-\nponents that increase the analytical complexity. Therefore,\nsimpliﬁed magnetic circuit model, which combined the mag-\nnetic reluctances in Fig. 6, is shown in Fig. 7. Where, the\nrelationship between magnetic reluctances in Fig. 6 and mag-\nnetic reluctances in Fig. 7 are represented by the following\nequation:\nR\nmt =Rmw +Rmo/2\nRlk =Rmc/2 ····························· (5)\nWhere, Rmt is the combined magnetic reluctance of the\ntransformer part, andRlk is the combined magnetic reluctance\nof the leakage inductor part of the center leg. It is important\nto analyze the peak magnetic ﬂux in the core and the inductor\nFig. 6. Magnetic circuit model for novel coupled inductor\nFig. 7. Simpliﬁed magnetic circuit model for novel coupled\ninductor\n(a) d <0.5( b ) d ≧ 0.5\nFig. 8. Waveforms of ﬂux in the core\nFig. 9. Relationship between the peak magnetic ﬂux of\nthe winding leg and the center leg\nripple current in order to design the novel coupled inductor.\nFirst, characteristics of magnetic ﬂuxes in the core are de-\nscribed. Figures 8(a) and (b) illustrate the magnetic ﬂux\nwaveforms for a duty cycle of lower than and greater than\n0.5, respectively. The magnetic ﬂux in the winding leg is in-\ncreased for the gate signal in on the period, and is decreased\nin the oﬀperiod. On the other hand, the magnetic ﬂux in the\ncenter leg is twice the frequency compared with the winding\nleg.\nHere, the maximum ﬂux in the winding leg of phase 1,Φ\n1p,\nis given by: (Φ1p =Φ2p from a symmetric structure)\nΦ1p =Φ2p = NIL\nRmt +2 ·Rlk\n+1\n2 ·Vi\nN ·d ·Ts ······· (6)\nWhere, IL is the average inductor current, d is the duty ra-\ntio, Ts is the switching period. On the other hand, maximum\n398 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.3, No.5, 2014\nA Integrated Magnetic Core Structure for Interleaved ConvertersʢJun Imaoka et al.ʣ\nFig. 10.

Figure 9 shows the\nrelationship between the peak magnetic ﬂux of the winding\nleg and the center leg, with the ratio of peak magnetic ﬂux\nshown on the vertical axis and duty ratio on the horizontal\naxis. The deriving process of this ﬁgure is shown in Sect. 2\nof the appendix.\nIn this ﬁgure, coupling coeﬃcient, k, can be represented by\nequation as well:\nk =M\nL = Rlk\nRmt +Rlk\n····························· (9)\nFrom Fig. 9, the peak magnetic ﬂux in the center leg is\nlower than that in the winding leg at all ranges in duty ratio.\nFrom this ﬁgure, it is understood that is possible to minia-\nturize the sectional area of the center leg if a high coupling\nis realized. In addition, the maximum magnetic ﬂuxes in the\ncenter legs are not saturated if the sectional area of the center\nleg is equal to that of the winding legs.\nSecond, the characteristics of the inductor ripple current\nare described. Figure 10 shows the waveforms of inductor\ncurrent. Here, i\nm is magnetizing current in the transformer\npart.\nIn this proposed structure, most of the magnetizing current\nhardly ﬂows due to higher mutual inductance. Therefore, in-\nductor current of each phase can be operated on the twice the\nfrequency.\nPeak to peak amplitude of inductor current, ILpp, for duty\nratio d <0.5 is given by:\nILpp\n d<0.5 =\n(\nRmt +Rlk ·1 −2d\n1 −d\n)\n·Vi\nN2 ·d ·T ····· (10)\nFor the duty ratio d ≥0.5:\nILpp\n d≥0.5 =\n(\nRmt +Rlk ·2d −1\nd\n)\n·Vi\nN2 ·d ·Ts ····· (11)\nThe necessary parameters for the design can be derived\nfrom these equations.\nFig. 11. Design procedure for a novel coupled inductor\n3.2 Design for Novel Coupled Inductor In this sec-\ntion, the design method for the proposed coupled inductor is\nintroduced. And the design procedure of the novel coupled\ninductor is also proposed as shown in Fig. 11. The design\nprocedure is assumed using “general-purpose cores” because\nthey are easy-access for typical users. The design procedure\nis composed of 9 steps as shown in Fig. 11. As a case study,\nwe design and experiment the novel coupled inductor to con-\nﬁrm the validity of the design method and the e ﬀectiveness\nof the coupled inductor.\nStep 1: Experimental parameters are shown in Table 3.\nThe designed ripple current I\nLpp is 1 A.\nStep 2: The core size is selected considering mounting\nspace of the inductor on PCBs (Printed Wiring Board), and\nthe speciﬁcation of prototype core is shown in Table 4. The\ntwo E cores in EE50-Z and one I core in EI50-Z are selected\nas for this prototype. The core material of the prototype is\nferrite (Material: PC40, Supplier: TDK CO., LTD) because\n399 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.3, No.5, 2014\nA Integrated Magnetic Core Structure for Interleaved ConvertersʢJun Imaoka et al.ʣ\nTable 3. Experimental parameters\nTable 4. Core parameters\nit is cheap and it presents low losses at high frequency con-\nditions. The saturated ﬂux density of this core is 390 mT in\ncase of a temperature of 100\n◦C. Additionally, the designed\nﬂux density is 200 mT considering a de-rating factor.\nStep 3: Then, “minimum” magnetic reluctance in the\ntransformer part is investigated in order to get higher mutual\ninductance, and to reduce a magnetizing current of trans-\nformer part. In addition, higher mutual inductance value\ncontributes to reduce the leakage inductance value which is\nproportional to the amount of DC ﬂux in the core, if inductor\nripple current presents the same value with non-coupled in-\nductor. Therefore, higher coupling contributes downsizing\nmagnetic components. The minimum magnetic reluctance\nR\nmt in transformer part can be calculated from a geometric\npoint of view. The theoretical value is 0.124 A /μWb. If de-\nsigners would like to conﬁrm the magnetic reluctance from\nmeasured inductance value, following equations is useful to\nconﬁrm the magnetic reluctances:\n⎧⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎨⎪⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎪\n⎩\nR\nmt =N2 · 1\nLlk +2Mc\nRlk =N2 · Mc\nLlk (Llk +2Mc)\n···················· (12)\nIf designers coiled some windings to the core and mea-\nsured each inductance, these magnetic reluctances can be cal-\nculated.\nStep 4: Since novel magnetic core structure has two max-\nimum ﬂuxes in the center and winding legs, therefore, we\nhave to investigate a leg which has the highest maximum ﬂux\nin order to prevent magnetic saturation. From the relation-\nship between sectional areas of the prototype, the sectional\narea of the center leg (213.6 mm\n2) is larger than the wind-\ning leg (131.4 mm2). Hence, the ﬂux density of the winding\nlegs shows the highest ﬂux density according to the relation-\nship between each sectional area and each the peak magnetic\nﬂuxes as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, the maximum ﬂux Φ\nmax is\ngiven by:\nΦmax =Bmax ·AW ······························ (13)\nWhere, Aw is the sectional area in the winding leg.\nStep 5: Then, the number of winding turns are decided\nwithin the range which can satisfy both inductor ripple cur-\nrent and ﬂux density. In order to not exceed the designed\nΦ\nmax, the following equation is given as a condition.\nΦmax >Φ1p ···································· (14)\nFrom Eqs. (6), (11) and (14), the number of winding turns\nfor a novel coupled inductor is given by:\n2 ·ILpp ·Φmax\nVi ·d ·Ts\n· d\n2 ·d −1 ·N3 −\n(\nIL +ILpp · d\n2 ·d −1\n)\n·N2\n+\n(\n1 − 2 ·d\n2 ·d −1\n)\n·Rmt ·Φmax ·N\n+\n( d\n2 ·d −1 −1\n2\n)\n·Rmt ·Vi ·d ·Ts >0\n···················· (15)\nIf the designed speciﬁcations (as shown in Table 3 and Ta-\nble 4) are substituted into the equation (13), the following\nrelationship is obtained.\n−5.6 <N <4.3, N >28.3 ···················· (16)\nWinding turns into a range of −5.6 to 0 are impossible to\nmanufacture, and the range of 0 to 4.3 cannot be performed\nbecause the magnetic reluctance in the center leg presents\nnegative values. Therefore, the only e ﬀective valid area is\nN >28.3. In this case, the decided number of winding turns\nis 29 turns.\nStep 6:magnetic reluctance R\nlk is calculated to obtain de-\nsigned ripple current. From Eq. (11), Rlk value is obtained:\nRlk =\n(\nILpp · N2\nVi ·d ·Ts\n−Rmt\n)\n· d\n2d −1 ·········· (17)\nFrom (17), the value of magnetic reluctance Rlk is calcu-\nlated as 4.63 A/μWb.\nHere, if designers would like to optimize the design of sec-\ntional area Ac in terms of ﬂux density, Eqs. (7) ∼(8) and an\nequation related to ﬂux density ( Bmax =Φmax/Acore)a r eu s e -\nful. For example, if calculated parameters of the number of\nwinding turns, magnetic reluctances such asR\nmt, Rlk and sec-\ntional area shown in Table 4 are substituted into the Eq. (8),\nthe theoretical value of the ﬂux density in the center leg is\nshown as 95.8 mT. Therefore, it is possible to reduce sec-\ntional area A\nc. If designers would like to design the same\nﬂux density value (200 mT) with winding leg, the sectional\narea of the center leg is suﬃcient at 102 mm2, and this result\n400 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.3, No.5, 2014\nA Integrated Magnetic Core Structure for Interleaved ConvertersʢJun Imaoka et al.ʣ\nFig. 12. The prototype of coupled inductor with novel\nmagnetic core structure\ncontributes to downsizing the magnetic core.\nStep 7:Relationships among each inductance, the number\nof winding turns and the magnetic reluctances are obtained\nfrom the magnetic circuit model, shown in Fig. 7, and de-\nsigned inductance can be calculated by:\nL\nc =N2 · Rmt +Rlk\nR2\nmt +2 ·Rmt ·Rlk\nMc =N2 · Rlk\nR2\nmt +2 ·Rmt ·Rlk\nLlk =Lc −Mc =N2 · 1\nRmt +2 ·Rlk\n·············· (18)\nStep 8:Then, to realize the magnetic reluctance Rlk which\nis calculated in the step 6, the length of the air gap is calcu-\nlated theoretically.\nRlk is obtained from the following equation taking into ac-\ncount a geometrical point of view:\nRlk =1\n2 ·Rmc =1\n2 ·\n( lc −lg\nμ0 ·μr ·Ac\n+ lg\nμ0 ·Ac\n)\n······ (19)\nFrom (16), the air gap length of the center leg is described\nas follows:\nlg = 1\nμr −1 ·(2 ·Rlk ·μr ·μ0 ·Ac −lc) ··········· (20)\nAs a result, the air gap length of 2.5 mm was calculated.\nStep 9:Based on this design process, the coupled inductor\nconstructed for this study is shown in Fig. 12. In addition,\nTable 5 shows the speciﬁcation of the design and measured\nvalues. The small di ﬀerence between the designed and mea-\nsured value of the mutual inductance is occurred by an error\nbetween the designed and measured value of the magnetic re-\nluctance in the winding leg. In addition, the error of air gap\nlength between the designed the measured value is consider-\nably decreased as compared to conventional structures. Con-\ncerning the winding arrangement, if the windings are coiled\nintensively on coupled inductor with conventional structure,\ncoupling coe ﬃcient does not increase due to the inﬂuence\nof external leakage ﬂuxes\n(31). In the experimental case for the\nproposed structure, although the winding is coiled intensively\nin the winding leg, the coupling coeﬃcient was achieved with\na value of 0.968, which is a diﬃcult value in case of conven-\ntional structures.\nConcerning about the di ﬀerence of the air gap length be-\ntween Tables 1 and 5, Although conventional coupled induc-\ntor shown in Table 1 presents the error of about 15 times or\nmore between the designed and measured value of air gap\nlength, but the error of the air gap in the proposed structure\ncan be reduced to about 2 times or less.\nIn addition, as a reason why absolute lengths of the air gap\nare diﬀerent between the Tables 1 and 5 is diﬀerent: the size\nTable 5. Designed and measured parameter for the cou-\npled inductor\nFig. 13. Experimental waveforms of interleaved boost\nchopper circuit with novel coupled inductor. Wherev\ns1 is\nthe voltages of S1,a n di1 is the inductor current of phase 1\nof the two evaluated cores is di ﬀerent. However, it does not\ndeny the eﬀectiveness of the proposed structure, even taking\ninto account the diﬀerence in the core size.\n4. Experimental Results\nIn order to evaluate the proposed coupled inductor, the in-\nterleaved boost converter with the coupled inductor prototype\nwas constructed. Additionally, the prototype converter was\nequipped with average current balanced control, in order to\nprevent DC bias magnetism\n(32).\nThe experimental waveforms are shown in Fig. 13, where\nit is possible to infer that the measured value of peak to peak\namplitude of inductor current is 1 A. In this way, the proposed\ndesign is validated due to the measurements are correspond-\ning to the design values. In addition, inductor ripple current\nhas become almost twice the switching frequency because the\nmagnetizing current hardly ﬂows by high mutual inductance.\nThe current behavior contributes to the reduction of the RMS\nvalue of inductor current because magnetizing current hardly\nﬂows, improvement of power conversion e ﬃciency will ex-\npect in comparison with a conventional structure, if it cannot\nachieve higher coupling coe ﬃcient. In addition, magnetic\nsaturation has not occurred.\n5. Conclusion\nA novel integrated magnetic structure suitable for\ntransformer-linked interleaved DC/DC converter was pro-\nposed in this paper. High frequency inductor ripple cur-\nrent and reducing fringing ﬂux in the core were achieved by\nusing the proposed magnetic structure. Moreover, the de-\nsign method of the novel coupled inductor was established.\n401 IEEJ Journal IA, Vol.3, No.5, 2014\nA Integrated Magnetic Core Structure for Interleaved ConvertersʢJun Imaoka et al.ʣ\nFinally, the validation of the design method was conﬁrmed\nfrom experimental results.\nAcknowledgment\nThis research was ﬁnancially supported by SANKEN\nELECTRIC CO., LTD.

Measurement Method for Each Inductance\nIn this section, the measurement method for the leakage\ninductance and the mutual inductance of coupled inductors\nis introduced. Each inductance is measured by changing the\nwinding connection. The winding connection methods are\nshown in app. Fig. 1.\nFirst of all, Self-inductance L\n1 of phase 1 is measured by\nopening another winding as shown in app. Fig. 1(a). Simi-\nlarly, self-inductance L\n2 in phase 2 also can be measured by\nthis winding conﬁguration.\nThen, each winding is connected as inverse coupling as\nshown in app. Fig. 1(b).
