It\nprovides a starting point for investigating how we can better provide for the insects that we\nrely upon for pollination.\nIntroduction\nInsect pollination is a key regulating ecosystem service, vital to the functioning of terrestrial habi-\ntats. It is also crucial to crop production systems with 75% of crop species benefiting from insect\npollinators [1]. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is of major importance as a pollinator of both wild\nand crop plants [2]. It is also the provider of honey, a high-value nutritional product [2, 3]. Num-\nbers of managed honey bee colonies have decreased substantially in Europe and North America,\nalthough this has been balanced by increases in countries such as China and Argentina [4]. Over-\nall managed honey bee colonies have increased by around 45% between 1947 and 2005, but in\nthe same time period the proportion of crops requiring insect pollination has increased threefold,\nmeaning food production is more dependent on insect pollinators than ever before [4].\nAlthough the number of managed honey bee colonies has increased, there has been consid-\nerable concern worldwide over increased rates of honey bee colony loss due to poor health, in\nparticular due to the syndrome described as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) [5].\nIt is being increasingly recognised that there are a number of interacting drivers causing\npoor health and colony loss in honey bees. Pests and diseases, exposure to agrochemicals, api-\ncultural mismanagement and lack of genetic diversity all play a part [2, 3]. Alongside this are\nreductions in habitat suitable for foraging. Honey bee nutritional needs are met by nectar, pol-\nlen and water [6]. Intensive farming practices lead to reductions in habitats with diverse floral\nresources and increases in mass-flowering crops that provide a single floral resource over a lim-\nited period of time [1, 2]. Pollen from different plant species varies greatly in its protein content\nalong with the composition of lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals [7]. Nectar varies\nin the type and concentration of sugar and also contains a range of other trace elements [6].\nPollen diversity and quantity is known to affect disease tolerance and longevity in honey bees\nalthough further research is required in this area [8– 12]. It is therefore a distinct possibility\nthat nutritional stress due to lack of suitable foraging habitat may combine with other factors\nto cause ill health and colony loss in honey bees [1, 7, 13, 14].\nRecommendations for improving honey bee health, as well as maintaining populations of\nwild pollinators, include reducing exposure to insecticides, preventing and limiting the spread\nof disease and providing a greater diversity of floral resources throughout the year [1]. In\nfarmed landscapes greater floral resource can be achieved through maintaining areas of semi-\nnatural habitat, sowing flower-rich field margins and creating and maintaining hedgerows [1].\nUrban areas can potentially provide valuable foraging resources for honey bees and wild\npollinators [15]. Planting appropriate plants in gardens and amenity spaces can provide a high\ndiversity of floral resources and there are a number of schemes that provide lists of‘pollinator\nfriendly’ plants [16– 19]. Whilst some of these lists are based on careful observation over many\nyears, others are based on anecdotal information and generally lack a firm evidence base [20].\nIn order to optimise the provision of appropriate floral resources, a greater understanding is\nrequired of the foraging preferences of honey bees and wild pollinators and how this relates to\ntheir nutritional needs [1, 7, 21].\nFloral Composition of Honey\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0134735 August 26, 2015 2/2 0\nNational Botanic Garden of Wales (http://www.\ngardenofwales.org.uk/) (NdV). The funders had no\nrole in study design, data collection and analysis,\ndecision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nForaging in honey bees has been investigated in a number of ways. The pioneering work of\nKarl von Frisch and his associates [22] led to the discovery that the‘waggle dance’ of honey\nbees indicates the direction and distance to resources. A number of studies have decoded the\nhoney bee waggle dance to look at distances travelled, but these studies have not tended to\nfocus on the plants visited [23– 27]. Similarly, honey bees can be fitted with RFID tags that\ntrack movement, but again floral visitation has not been monitored [28].\nMethods used to assess floral visitation include identifying the pollen returned to the hive\nby honey bees, either directly by collecting pollen at the hive entrance using‘pollen traps’ or\nthrough examining pollen found within honey [29, 30]. Identifying pollen returned to the hive\nprovides a direct measure of pollen foraging, whilst the pollen within honey provides a longer-\nterm overview of plants being used for both nectar and pollen [29– 31]. These methods are typi-\ncally used to identify the botanical composition of honey in order to check its geographic origin\nfor food quality and traceability purposes [29]. They have more rarely been used to investigate\nforaging preferences [32].\nThe traditional method for identification of honey bee collected pollen is through morpho-\nlogical features revealed with light microscopy. If the pollen is within honey the extraction and\nidentification of the pollen is termed melissopalynology [29]. Morphological identification of\npollen requires considerable skill and experience [33]. Some plants can be particularly difficult\nto distinguish, for example species of Campanulaceae, Lamiaceae and Poaceae, as these exhibit\nfew unique morphological features [34– 36]. Within the Rosaceae individual species can show\nhigh levels of pollen grain morphological variation, making characterisation difficult [37].\nThe use of DNA-based methods for pollen identification has attracted interest in recent\nyears. DNA-based identification has the potential to reduce processing time and increase the\nlevel of species discrimination. In addition, it does not require the high level of taxonomic\nexpertise required for microscopic examination [33, 38– 40]. DNA can be successfully extracted\nfrom honey bee pollen loads and from within honey using a range of extraction methods [40–\n43]. A number of techniques have been used to identify the plant species. Laube et al. (2010)\nsuccessfully used real-time PCR to identify plant species found within Corsican honey, but this\nmethod requires ana prioriknowledge of the species likely to be found [44]. Wilson et al.\n(2010) investigated pollen foraging in HawaiianHylaeus bees using PCR followed by Sanger\nsequencing; this is effective for samples composed of a single plant species but cannot be used\nfor pollen containing a mixture of species [45]. PCR amplification, followed by cloning and\nsequencing has been used for both pollen [35] and honey [33, 38, 46]. Cloning is a time con-\nsuming process, however, and places limits on the sequencing depth that can be obtained.\nA DNA metabarcoding approach combining the amplification of universal markers with\nhigh throughput sequencing (HTS) gives the opportunity to analyse many samples, containing\nmixtures of species, with extensive depth of coverage [47]. HTS technologies, especially Roche\n454 and Illumina sequencing platforms, have been successfully used in applications including\nthe composition of microbial [48, 49\n], freshwater [50] and fungal communities [51, 52], diet\nanalysis [53– 55] and biodiversity assessments [56, 57].\nA small number of studies have investigated the use of pollen DNA metabarcoding. Kraaije-\nveld et al. (2015) used the Ion Torrent system to assess the effectiveness of DNA metabarcoding\nfor quantifying airborne pollen, whilst Richardson et al. (2015) used Illumina Mi-seq and Kel-\nler et al. (2015) used 454 pyrosequencing to characterise pollen retrieved from pollen traps on\nhoney bee hives [36, 58, 59]. Valentini et al. (2010) trialled the use of 454 pyrosequencing to\ncharacterise two commercial honey samples [39].\nPrevious studies have used either plastid markers such asrbcL, trnH-psbA and trnL [33, 35,\n36, 38, 39] or the nuclear ITS and ITS2 region [45, 58, 59]. Key considerations for markers\nused for DNA metabarcoding are: 1) Primers should be universal so that all of the species\nFloral Composition of Honey\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0134735 August 26, 2015 3/2 0\nwithin the mixture are amplified. 2) The region should have a level of discrimination suitable\nfor the questions being asked. 3) Correct identification relies on the quality and comprehen-\nsiveness of the reference library that unknown samples are compared to [60].\nrbcL is one of the internationally agreed core DNA barcodes for plants [61], whilsttrnH-\npsbA and ITS2 are recognised as valuable additional markers [62– 64]. ITS2 andtrnH-psbA\noften exhibit higher levels of species discrimination compared torbcL but they have lower lev-\nels of universality [63,64]. This lower universality means that some species within mixed sam-\nples will not be detected using ITS2 andtrnH-psbA [60].\nIn this study we assess the potential of using DNA metabarcoding to characterise the floral\ncomposition of honey in order to investigate honey bee foraging. We compare DNA metabar-\ncoding using therbcL DNA barcode marker and 454 pyrosequencing with microscopic analysis\nfor nine honey samples provided by domestic beekeepers in Wales and England (UK). We\nthen use the plants recorded with both techniques to discuss honey bee foraging preferences.\nWe have used therbcL marker as it is one of the core DNA barcodes for plants and provides\nthe highest degree of universality of all the regions assessed for DNA barcoding [61]. de Vere\net al. (2012) have assembled arbcL DNA barcode reference library for 98% of the native Welsh\nflora as part of the Barcode Wales project [65]. This provides a comprehensive reference library\nfor this current study.\nMaterials and Methods\nHoney Samples\nHoney samples were provided by domestic beekeepers from Wales and England (UK) (Table 1\nand Fig 1).

The hives\nwere located in gardens or small-holdings and descriptions from the beekeepers and examina-\ntion of aerial images using Google Earth were used to describe the dominant vegetation types\nsurrounding the hives. An area with a radius of 7km from the location of the hives was exam-\nined (Table 1). This distance was taken as a realistic foraging range based on a number of forag-\ning studies on honey bees [23– 27].\nS1 Fileprovides the hive locations as a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file loadable in\nGoogle Earth.\nMelissopalynology\nPollen analysis was performed following the guidelines of the International Honey Commis-\nsion [29, 66]. 2 g of honey was mixed with 40 ml of 0.5% sulphuric acid solution. Samples were\nincubated in a water bath for 5 minutes at 80°C. Samples were filtered through a 5μm filter,\nplaced in a filter assembly with pump, and 500 ml hot distilled water was used to rinse the sam-\nples. The filter was washed using 8 ml of glacial acetic acid to dehydrate the sample and a cen-\ntrifuge step was performed at 3000g for 2 minutes. The supernatant was decanted, mixed with\n1 ml acetolysis mixture and placed in a water bath at 80°C for 12 minutes. The centrifugation\nstep was repeated, the sample was then resuspended in 1 ml glacial acetic acid and centrifuged\nonce more. Three drops were mounted onto a microscope slide and examined under a light\nmicroscope at x400 and x1000 magnification. Identification of the pollen grains was under-\ntaken with reference to type slides of pollen from the United Kingdom and to pollen atlases\nFig 1.

A minimum of 300 grains were characterised and unidentifiable grains were also\nnoted.\nDNA extraction\nTotal DNA was extracted from 10 g of honey using a protocol developed from published meth-\nods adapted for use within the current study [38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 71]. Total DNA from each of\nthe honeys was extracted four times so that DNA was recovered from a total of 40 g of each\nhoney. For each DNA extraction the honey sample was placed into a sterile 50 ml centrifuge\ntube followed by the addition of 30 ml of ultrapure water. Samples were incubated at 65°C for\n30 minutes with occasional shaking. Samples were then centrifuged for 30 minutes at 15,000g.\nThe supernatant was discarded and each pellet was resuspended in 400μl of Buffer AP1 from a\nDNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) to which 80μl of proteinase K (1 mg/ml) had been added.\nSamples were disrupted using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) with 3 mm tungsten carbide beads for\n4 minutes at 30 1/s and then incubated for 10 minutes at 65°C in a waterbath. The subsequent\nsteps of the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit were followed according to the manufacturer’s instructions,\nwith the exception that the QIAshredder column and second wash stage were omitted. The\nextracted DNA was stored at -20°C prior to subsequent analysis.\nAmplification and Sequencing\nDNA was amplified using therbcL DNA barcode marker region [61]. Two rounds of PCR were\ncarried out, firstly to amplify therbcL region and then to attach unique 5 bp tags so that differ-\nent samples could be separated bioinformatically after sequencing.\nSamples were first amplified using the universal primers rbcLaf and rbcLr590 [65] to which\nadaptor ‘tails’ had been added (rbcLaf+adaptor: GACGATGAGTCCTGAGGTATGTCACCA\nCAAACAGAGACTAAAGC rbcLr590+adaptor: GACGATGAGTCCTGAGGTAGTCCACC\nGCGTAGACATTCAT). PCR was performed in a final volume of 25μl. A total of 2.5μl of tem-\nplate DNA was combined with 12.5μl of 2x Biomix (Bioline), 0.5μl of each primer (5μM),\n1.0 μl of BSA (10μM) and 8.0μl of molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction was\nperformed in a thermal cycler MJ Mini (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) using the\nfollowing program: initial denaturing at 95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for\n2 minutes, 50°C for 90 seconds, 72°C for 40 seconds with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min-\nutes and 30°C for 10 seconds [65].\nThe products were visualised on a 1% agarose gel and those producing the brightest bands\nwere diluted by 1/2000, those producing medium bands were diluted by 1/1000 and those pro-\nducing faint bands were diluted by 1/500. 2.5μl of the diluted product was used as the template\nfor the second round of PCR. This contained a mixture of 12.5μl of 2x Biomix (Bioline), 1.0μl\nof a unique 5 bp tag with adaptor (10μM), 1.0μl of BSA (10μM) and 8.0μl of molecular biol-\nogy grade water. The PCR reaction was repeated as for the first PCR but with 15 cycles. Each\nsample was amplified twice using this procedure and the resulting products from all the PCR\nruns were then pooled and purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). A total of\n90 μl of pooled DNA was sent for Roche/454 GS FLX Titanium pyrosequencing at the Univer-\nsity of Pennsylvania using a ¼ plate.\nData Analysis\nSequences were sorted according to the identity of their 5 bp tag into the different honey sam-\nples and were assessed for quality and length. Any sequences where the 5 bp tag and the entire\nprimer sequence could not be found were removed. The tag and primer sequences were then\ntrimmed and sequences with a read length of 250 bp or less after trimming were discarded.\nFloral Composition of Honey\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0134735 August 26, 2015 6/2 0\nTwo local BLAST databases were created; the first was fromrbcL sequences obtained from\nthe Barcode Wales project, which provided 98% coverage for the native flowering plants of\nWales [65]. The second database was generated by extracting all of the chloroplast sequence\ndata from GenBank. Each DNA sequence obtained from the honey samples was scored simul-\ntaneously against both databases using Megablast. If the sequence top bit score matched to a\nsingle species, then the sequence was identified to that species. If the top bit score was the same\nfor different species belonging to the same genus, then the result was given to genus. If the top\nbit score belonged to multiple genera within the same family then a family level designation\nwas made. Sequences blasting to multiple families were considered to be unknown. Scripts\nwritten in Python were used to automat the BLAST analysis and to summarise the output\n(S2 File).\nResults for each honey sample were then manually filtered so that only species recorded\nwithin the UK were retained. Stace (2010) and Cubey & Merrick (2014) were used as references\nfor plants occurring in the UK as natives, aliens or in horticulture or agriculture [72, 73]. If a\nspecies was not recorded within the UK then the sequence was reclassified to genus level.\nTo reduce results arising from amplification or sequencing errors, taxa recorded from less\nthan 10 sequences for that honey sample were removed from further analysis [60]. Files con-\ntaining the sequence reads used in this study are available through the sequence read archive\n(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP055687, SRA accession: SRP055687).\nResults\nComparison of DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology\nIn total 51,131 sequences over 250 bp in length could be attributed to tagged sequences of\nrbcL using the 454 pyrosequencing approach (Table 2). Of these, 47,512 reads (93%) could be\ncharacterised to family, genus or species level. One sample, H3, provided a very low number of\nreads that could be assigned (149) but for the other honeys the number of identifiable reads\nranged from 3745 to 8097 (Table 2). Sequence quality was also slightly lower for sample H3.\nFor the other samples the results were very similar with an average QV of 28 and with between\n83% to 85% of reads having a QV greater than 20. The number of pollen grains counted using\nmelissopalynology was fixed at around 300 grains per sample. Of these, a high percentage\ncould be identified to species, genus or family level (98% to 100%).\nTable 2.

With melissopalynology the number of taxa\ndetected at family, genus or species level ranged from 8 to 31 whilst DNA metabarcoding\ndetected 5 to 24 taxa across the honey samples (Table 3and S1 Dataset). On average DNA meta-\nbarcoding identified a greater number of the taxa to species level (31% compared to 27%) but\nthis difference was not statistically significant (t: 1.288, df: 16, p: 0.216). Both DNA metabarcod-\ning and melissopalynology detected most taxa to genera (mean 51% and 50% respectively).\nThe number of taxa that match between DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology ranges\nfrom 22% to 45% (Fig 2). Both DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology detect additional\ntaxa not found with the other technique. This ranges from 24% to 60% additional taxa for\nDNA metabarcoding and from 10% to 46% for melissopalynology. For most of the honeys (6\nout of 9) DNA metabarcoding detects more additional taxa compared to melissopalynology. A\nhigh proportion of the taxa recorded using microscopy but not found in the DNA analysis\nwere represented by single pollen grains, indicating that they are at low abundance within the\nhoney sample (Fig 2).\nThere are 11 plant families with more than one genus or species recorded for either DNA\nmetabarcoding or microscopy (Table 4). Of these, five families have the same number of taxa\ndetected for DNA and microscopy. However, for the Rosaceae, Asteraceae and Onagraceae,\nDNA metabarcoding identifies a greater number of taxa. For the Boraginaceae, Ranunculaceae\nand Euphorbiaceae, microscopy detects more taxa but each of these is only represented by one\nor two pollen grains (Table 4and S1 Dataset). The proportion of taxa distinguishable to species\nis similar with both methods. Over all of the families, DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynol-\nogy each detect 26 taxa. DNA metabarcoding is able to distinguish 10 out of 26 to species level\ncompared to 8 out of 26 using microscopy.\nAlthough there are differences in the plants found between the techniques, the dominant\nfloral components of the honeys are detected with both methods. However, the relative abun-\ndance detected differs. There are 24 taxa (family, genus or species level) that appear with>20%\nabundance across all of the honey samples using both DNA metabarcoding and microscopy\n(indicated with a red outline inFig 3). Of these, 22 taxa are found using both methods, giving\n92% correspondence between DNA and microscopy. Of the two plants that do not match, one\nof these is DNA from a fern that would not have been included in the microscopic analysis.\nTable 3.

After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, only one honey (H3),\nshows a significant correlation between the abundance of taxa found using the two techniques.\nRepeat sampling using DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology\nDNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology was repeated on two samples of honey H1 (H1\nand H1_2) in order to investigate repeatability. Each sample was a separate extraction from the\nsame hive collected at the same time. The two methods detected comparable numbers of taxa\nwithin each repeat but the similarity of the taxa found was much higher for DNA metabarcod-\ning compared to melissopalynology (Table 5and S2 Dataset). There was a 64% match of the\ntaxa found using DNA metabarcoding compared to just 28% with melissopalynology.\nPlants used by honey bees for foraging\nA number of plants were recorded from more than one honey sample (Table 6). The most fre-\nquently found herbaceous plants wereRubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Impatiens\nFig 2.

Tree pollen was also frequently seen, especiallyCastanea sativa, Crataegus mono-\ngyna, along withMalus, Salix and Quercus species (Table 6).\nAn interesting observation was the presence of non-flowering plants detected with the DNA\nanalysis but not microscopy.Juniperus and Pinus species were found in honey H2, and DNA\nfrom the fern genusAthyrium was found in high levels in honey H9 (Fig 3).\nThe plants detected reflect the vegetation that surrounds the hives. The high frequency of\nTrifolium is indicative of the improved and semi-improved pastures found close to all of the\nhives, andTaraxacum officinaleand Rubus fruticosusare frequent in the rough grassland and\nhedgerows surrounding pasture.Impatiens glanduliferais a highly invasive, non-native species,\nof riparian habitat and is consistently found when the hives are close to rivers.Filipendula\nulmaria is a common species of damp grasslands and hedgebanks and is found in all of the\nWelsh honeys but not in the honey from England (H2).\nH2 was the only sample from hives located close to fields of oil seed rape. The high level of\nBrassica pollen in this honey is therefore likely to beBrassica napus. Interestingly, though,\nmany of the honeys containBrassica pollen, although the other hives are not located near to oil\nseed rape. TheBrassica detected in these samples may be gardenBrassica species grown for\nfood or the commonly occurringBrassica rapa[74].\nThree of the honey samples came from hives in the vicinity of urban areas (H2, H7 and H8)\nbut only one (H1) had hives located within an urban area containing many small gardens. This\nhoney has more taxa than the other honey samples and features a range of horticultural plants\nincluding species belonging toMuscari, Galium, Rosa, Prunus, Sorbus and Skimmia japonica\n(S1 Dataset).\nDiscussion\nUsing DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology for identifying the\nfloral composition of honey\nDNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology are both effective methods for detecting the most\nabundant pollen found within honey samples. Both methods detect the dominant constituents\nTable 4.

This is not surprising as honey is a highly heterogeneous natural\nproduct and the sampling strategy adopted for the two methods is different. Melissopalynology\nuses a starting sample of 2 g of honey whilst the DNA method adopted here uses 40 g of honey\nin total.\nAnalysis of honey H1 and H1_2 that came from the same hive reflects the variability of sam-\npling. DNA metabarcoding has a much higher reproducibility, with 64% similarity compared\nto 28% for melissopalynology. This is likely to be due to the greater amount of pollen that can\nbe screened using the DNA metabarcoding approach.\nFig 3.

The degree of characterisation required, however,\ndepends on the question being posed. For many questions, determining the most frequently\nused floral resources is of more relevance than determining the less frequently used plant\nspecies.\nSome of the differences in the plants detected reflect biases within both the DNA metabar-\ncoding and microscopic analysis. For some families, for example the Rosaceae and Asteraceae,\nDNA metabarcoding provides a higher level of resolution compared to melissopalynology. For\nother families such, as the Boraginaceae and Euphorbiaceae, DNA metabarcoding appears less\nable to detect species within these groups.\nDNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology show little correspondence in the relative\nabundance of taxa found within the honey samples. As a direct count of the pollen grains pres-\nent, melissopalynology provides a more quantitative measure, albeit with a smaller sample size.\nThe inability of DNA metabarcoding to provide quantitative results has been observed in a\nrange of studies [36, 53, 56, 58]. There are many stages in the DNA analysis process where\nbiases can occur that will prevent a quantitative estimation of floral composition.\nPollen grains vary in shape, size and pollen wall composition and this is likely to affect DNA\nextraction efficiency for different species [76]. The DNA analysed for DNA metabarcoding\noften comes from plastid markers, such asrbcL, trnL or psbA-trnH [33, 35, 36, 39, 55]. Within\nmost flowering plants chloroplasts are maternally inherited but the pollen grain contains plas-\ntids within the vegetative cell that can be targeted. The number of plastids varies with different\nspecies and also with the maturity of the pollen grain [76]. Nevertheless, studies on DNA\nextracted from pollen have shown excellent ability to amplify plastid markers over a wide\nrange of species, confirming the presence of sufficient DNA [33, 35, 36, 39].\nOnce the DNA is extracted, PCR biases can lead to some taxa being preferentially amplified\n[77]. In order to minimise this it is important to use a marker with a high degree of universality\nacross a broad range of taxonomic groups [78]. We have used therbcL DNA barcode marker\nas it has been shown to have the highest universality of all markers that have been proposed for\nDNA barcoding plants [61]. However, even with high universality of primers, when working\non species in isolation, amplification may still be skewed within a multi-template PCR [53].\nSome species, especially those present in low quantities, can be missed out when a mixed sam-\nple is amplified [57, 79]. This is illustrated within the current study where species recorded\nusing microscopy from a single pollen grain are less likely to be detected using DNA metabar-\ncoding. Techniques are being developed that avoid the PCR stage altogether, such as using\nshotgun sequencing with subsequent recovery of DNA barcode markers or even whole chloro-\nplasts [56, 78, 80, 81].\nA key factor in the ability to identify species using DNA metabarcoding is the comprehen-\nsiveness and quality of the reference database that unknown sequences are compared to [78].\nThis study relies on the fact that 98% of the Welsh native flora has been DNA barcoded with\nthe rbcL region [65]. This library is not complete, however, as none of the non-native and gar-\nden flora have been DNA barcoded, meaning that identifications for these species rely on the\navailability of these groups in GenBank.\nGroundtruthing using known distributions of plant species for the geographic area being\nsampled can help to improve discrimination [\n65]. The method used here filters the BLAST\nresults generated so that only plants found growing within the UK, whether native, alien or in\nhorticulture or agriculture, are recorded, with any remaining listed as unknown.\nMelissopalynology as a method for characterising the floral composition of honey also has\nlimitations. Some plant groups are known to be difficult to distinguish and some plants can\nonly be taken to the level of family due to lack of morphological differences in the pollen grains\n[35, 36]. The major limitation to the microscopic investigation of honey, however, is the high\nFloral Composition of Honey\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0134735 August 26, 2015 13 / 20\ndegree of expertise required to identify the different pollen types. The time associated with\nidentifying each pollen grain puts limitations on the size of sample that can be screened. Micro-\nscopic analysis provides a direct quantification of the number of pollen grains but because only\na limited number of pollen grains can be processed it means the coverage of the honey is low.\nAlthough both DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology have limitations, both are use-\nful tools in understanding the floral composition of honey. The value of DNA metabarcoding\nis that a greater volume of honey can be investigated and the technique does not require the\nhigh level of taxonomic expertise required to identify the pollen within the honey using micros-\ncopy. Once optimised, the technique allows the identification of many samples very quickly. It\nis not suitable, however, if an exact estimation of pollen quantity is required, and it is possible\nthat species occurring at low levels will not be detected.\nDNA metabarcoding has the potential to provide a valuable technique for identifying the\nfloral composition of honey relevant to ecological studies investigating foraging and also food\nquality assessments requiring an understanding of the geographic source of honeys [82, 83].\nThe technique can easily be adapted to survey pollen found on the bodies of other pollinating\ninsect groups, providing a valuable method for assessing pollinator foraging preferences.\nUsing the floral composition of honey to investigate honey bee foraging\nExamining the floral composition of honey provides a means of observing honey bee foraging\nover the season in which the honey was made. The honeys examined here cover a geographic\nrange of 315 km and encompass both agricultural and more urban habitats. The floral compo-\nsition of honey reflects the environment the honey bees are foraging within.Trifolium species\nare characteristic of improved and semi-improved pastures, whilstTaraxcum officinale, Rubus\nfruticosus and Filipendula ulmariaare found in hedgebanks and rough grassland. The invasive\nImpatiens glanduliferais seen where hives are located within foraging range of rivers. The fre-\nquent presence ofMalus and Rosa species reflects the location of hives in the gardens and\nsmall-holdings of domestic beekeepers where these plants are frequently grown.Brassica spe-\ncies are regularly detected and are likely to be either oil seed rape (Brassica napus), gardenBras-\nsica species grown for food or the commonly occurringBrassica rapa[74].\nOf particular note is the greater number of plant species recorded when the honey bees are\nlocated within a small urban area with many gardens, where a range of commonly grown gar-\nden plants are detected (H1). The importance of gardens for honey bees and wild pollinators is\nbeing increasingly recognised [15– 19]. Lists of‘pollinator-friendly’ plants are widely available\nbut often do not have a firm evidence base [20]. Using DNA metabarcoding of honey provides\na method for assessing the horticultural plants honey bees actually use. This approach can be\nadapted for other pollinator groups such as bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies by DNA\nmetabarcoding the pollen on their bodies, in order to assess the plants they visit. This can be\nused to refine pollinator plant lists in order to provide more targeted advice to gardeners, farm-\ners and landowners.\nAlthough the plants reflect the vegetation the honey bees are foraging within, what is espe-\ncially notable is the similarity of the plants found across the different honey samples. Honey\nbees are generally considered to be supergeneralists, utilising a very wide range of plant species\nfor nectar and pollen [2, 84]. The honeys examined in this study contained plants with a broad\ntaxonomic range, covering 46 families and 25 orders, but a relatively small number of plants\nare consistently recorded across the majority of the honeys. The plants detected here will be of\nno surprise to beekeepers, who have long stated that particular plants are important to honey\nbees throughout the season [85]. Synge (1947) used pollen trapping to produce a detailed list of\nplants foraged upon by honey bees located in the Rothamsted Experimental Station in SE\nFloral Composition of Honey\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0134735 August 26, 2015 14 / 20\nEngland [30]. Of the 34 major pollen sources he notes, we find 62% of these in our honey sam-\nples. He describes 54 plants of minor importance and we have detected 33% of these. Free and\nWilliams (1974) investigated floral constancy of honey bees placed in crops of sweet cherry,\nkale, field bean and red clover within the Rothamsted Experimental Station [86]. Although\nthese crops provided an abundant nectar and pollen source, and were actively worked by the\nhoney bees, they also regularly utilised a small number of additional plants. Of the 15 com-\nmonly used plants recorded by Free and Williams (1974), 11 (73%) are recorded within the\npresent study including the frequently observedRubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Taraxa-\ncum officinale, Crataegus monogyna, Trifolium and Brassica [86]. A valuable area of further\nresearch is to discover why these particular species are important. This could relate to the ease\nof availability and abundance of the plant, the quality and abundance of the nectar and pollen\nand/or specific nutrients or trace elements provided by these species. An understanding of the\nreasons why honey bees target certain plants could help to provide guidance on what consti-\ntutes a balanced honey bee diet.\nAlong with the frequently found species there are some interesting plants found only in one\nor two honey samples. The presence of non-flowering species such as juniper and pine may\nreflect honey bees collecting resin from these conifers in order to make propolis [87]. Resin is\nactively collected from a range of species and combined with wax to make propolis which is\ndeposited within the hive as it has antimicrobial properties [87]. Another possibility is that the\npresence of DNA of conifers is due to bees foraging on honeydew. Honey bees sometimes col-\nlect the exudate from sap-sucking insects as an alternative to nectar [88].\nAn unusual plant recorded here is DNA belonging to the fern genusAthyrium. This occurs\nin just one honey sample so could potentially be considered as an anomalous result, butAthyr-\nium was also recorded in a commercial honey analysed by Valentini (2010)[39]. We cannot\nfind any discussion in the literature of honey bees collecting material from pteridophytes, but\nthe presence of pteridophyte spores has been recorded in a small number of palynological\ninvestigations from Nigeria [89], Nepal [90] and New Zealand [91]. The spores are typically\nconsidered to be a contaminant that has occurred at some stage in the processing of the honey.\nBut spores are a protein source much like pollen so honey bees may well forage upon them.\nAlthough the collection of fern spores has not been discussed, honey bees collecting fungal\nspores was first recorded by Cook in 1885 and sporadically in other reports since then [92].\nAlong with discovering the reasons why some plants are consistently used by honey bees,\nunderstanding more about the rarely recorded species may reveal interesting insights into\nhoney bee behaviour.\nHoney DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology provide valuable techniques for record-\ning the plants honey bees visit for nectar and pollen. This provides a starting point for investi-\ngating what plants are most important within the honey bees environment in order for them to\nmeet their nutritional needs and maintain healthy colonies. If certain species or types of plant\nare favoured throughout the year then we can ensure that these are provided.\nBoth DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology are effective techniques for detecting the\nmost abundant floral sources within honey, but DNA metabarcoding has the advantage of not\nrequiring high levels of taxonomic expertise. It provides a method that can be easily and widely\nused to answer questions about pollinator foraging behaviour.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Dataset.
