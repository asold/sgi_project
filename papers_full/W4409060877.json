    "abstract": "To enhance the accessibility and accuracy of plant protection knowledge for agricultural practitioners, this study develops an intelligent question-answering (QA) system based on a large language model (LLM). A local knowledge base was constructed by vectorizing 7000 research papers and books in the field of plant protection, from which 568 representative papers were selected to generate QA data using an LLM. After data cleaning and filtering, a fine-tuning dataset comprising 9000 question–answer pairs was curated. To optimize the model’s performance, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) was applied to the InterLM-20B model, resulting in the InterLM-20B-LoRA, which was integrated with Langchain-ChatChat and the local knowledge base to develop the QA system. Additionally, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology was implemented to enhance response accuracy by enabling the model to retrieve relevant field-specific knowledge before generating answers, effectively mitigating the risk of hallucinated information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves an answer accuracy of 97%, highlighting its potential as an advanced solution for intelligent agricultural QA services.",
