  "abstract": "Fact-checking and critical thinking are essential life skills in an age of rampant misinformation. To cultivate these skills in young learners, we have developed 'A Mystery for You' – an educational game powered by a large language model (LLM) and a tangible interface. In this game, a player becomes a citizen fact-checker, responding to 'news alerts' printed out by the game interface. The player investigates various actors and evidence by inserting cartridge combinations into the game interface. Each move the player makes results in the generation and printing of a follow-up 'news update,' which they must use to make an informed verdict about the truth or falsehood of the news. This interactive process sharpens critical thinking skills and enhances familiarity with generative AI's misinformation capacities. This paper contextualizes the game's relevance in today's media and politics, explores game-play mechanics, and critically reflects on incorporating AI generation tools for educational game play.",
