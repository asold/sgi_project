  "abstract": "The increasing reliance on AI-driven applications necessitates robust methods to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information generated by these systems. The integration of the Socratic method within AI models represents a novel approach to addressing the critical issue of hallucinations, where models produce factually incorrect or logically inconsistent outputs. This research presents an innovative methodology that leverages structured questioning, self-critique mechanisms, iterative training processes, and automated evaluation metrics to systematically enhance the quality of responses generated by the Llama model. The results demonstrate significant improvements in coherence, factual accuracy, relevance, and logical consistency, thereby reducing the incidence of hallucinations. The study's findings have important implications for the deployment of AI in high-stakes applications, suggesting that the Socratic method can be effectively scaled and adapted across various domains to develop more reliable and trustworthy AI systems. Future work may explore further refinements of the questioning algorithms and expand the evaluation metrics to achieve even greater enhancements in model performance, paving the way for advancements in AI safety and robustness.",
