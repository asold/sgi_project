    "abstract": "Do large language models (LLMs) make human-like linguistic generalizations?\\nDentella et al. (2023) (\"DGL\") prompt several LLMs (\"Is the following sentence\\ngrammatically correct in English?\") to elicit grammaticality judgments of 80\\nEnglish sentences, concluding that LLMs demonstrate a \"yes-response bias\" and a\\n\"failure to distinguish grammatical from ungrammatical sentences\". We\\nre-evaluate LLM performance using well-established practices and find that\\nDGL's data in fact provide evidence for just how well LLMs capture human\\nbehaviors. Models not only achieve high accuracy overall, but also capture\\nfine-grained variation in human linguistic judgments.\\n",
