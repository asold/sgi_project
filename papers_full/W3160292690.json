  "abstract": "The safety of electric power networks depends on the health of the transformer. However, once a variety of transformer failure occurs, it will not only reduce the reliability of the power system but also cause major accidents and huge economic losses. Until now, many diagnosis methods have been proposed to monitor the operation of the transformer. Most of these methods cannot be detected and diagnosed online and are prone to noise interference and high maintenance cost that will cause obstacles to the real-time monitoring system of the transformer. This paper presents a full-time online fault monitoring system for cast-resin transformer and proposes an overheating fault diagnosis method based on infrared thermography (IRT) images. First, the normal and fault IRT images of the cast-resin transformer are collected by the proposed thermal camera monitoring system. Next is the model training for the Wasserstein Autoencoder Reconstruction (WAR) model and the Differential Image Classification (DIC) model. The differential image can be acquired by the calculation of pixel-wise absolute difference between real images and regenerated images. Finally, in the test phase, the well-trained WAR and DIC models are connected in series to form a module for fault diagnosis. Compared with the existing deep learning algorithms, the experimental results demonstrate the great advantages of the proposed model, which can obtain the comprehensive performance with lightweight, small storage size, rapid inference time and adequate diagnostic accuracy.",
