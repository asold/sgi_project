  "abstract": "In this paper, magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles based nanofluid has been synthesized and characterized for application in oil filled transformers.The intent of this work is to check the feasibility of magnetite based nanofluid through appropriate characterizations.Magnetite nanoparticles have been synthesized by chemical co-precipitation method and the corresponding nanoparticles have been characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray diffraction, UV-Vis spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy.Further, ferrofluid has been characterized at different concentrations of nanoparticles those including 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% w/v % to report optimal concentration for improved dielectric and thermal performance of the nanofluid.Electrical measurements such as resistivity, permittivity and loss tangent at different concentrations of magnetite are reported.It is inferred that 20% concentration of magnetite is an optimal concentration with an improvement of 34% of BDV.Importantly, with the application of magnetite nanoparticles overall thermal and dielectric behavior of the insulation fluid will be improved while reducing the size and weight of the transformers.",
