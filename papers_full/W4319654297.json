This operation often has a dangerous \nimpact on transformer reliability because additional currents, we \ncall \"circulation currents\", create extra losses, generally not \ntaken into account by analytical approaches.  Yet, hot points \nwhich result from these currents can destroy the component.  In \nplanar transformers, windings are made of PCB layers and \ncirculation currents lead to severe unbalance of current sharing \nbetween parallel layers. This paper presents an analytical method \nwhich enables currents in all layers to be evaluated using only a \ncircuit simulation software such as Pspice ®  or PSIM ® . For a \ndesigner, this method is very intuitive and fast compared with the \nuse of fem simulations.  \nKeywords-planar transformers; PCB parallel windings ; \ncirculation current; model; analytical calculation. \nI.   INTRODUCTION  \nFrequency rise in power electronic converters has induced a \ndiminution of active and passive component sizes. Above \n100 kHz, traditional round winding transformers are often \nreplaced by planar ones which use low profile magnetic cores \nand printed circuit board (PCB) for turns.  \nFor actual applications which need high output currents, the \nuse of PCB conductors 50-150µm thick is problematic. Even if \nit is some cm wide, cross section of one layer remains small so \nseveral layers have to be wired in parallel to sustain several \nhundredths of Amps [1]. Unfortunately, paralleling several \nlayers doesn’t result automatically in a balanced current \nsharing. Indeed, flux flowing through these parallel turns is \nslightly different and so are induced voltages. As a result, \nadditional currents, here called \"circulation currents\", are \ncreated by these low differential voltages. These internal extra \ncurrents are only limited by turn impedances so they seriously \nimpact component losses and reliability. Consequently, \naccounting for them is not optional for the designer. \nAt first sight, to design a transformer and predict the \ncurrent distribution between parallel layers, fem simulations \ncan be used [2]. In practice, planar transformers are quite \ncomplex-we studied one including 44 conductive layers-so \ndetailed description of shape and physical properties is time \nconsuming. Worst, to correctly account for eddy currents, \nmeshing must be fine enough so a very large memory computer \nis needed to carry out a simulation at around 1 MHz and such a \nsimulation lasts several hours.  \nIn order to short the \"engineer-time\" needed to study such a \nplanar transformer intended for an industrial application and to \nease optimization process, we developed a method, based on an \nanalytical approach, which enables the designer to obtain the \nneeded results by using any circuit simulation software [3]. \nSuch software is among the familiar tools of the designer and \nrelated simulations last seconds rather hours, even for complex \nmulti-layer planar transformer. \nII.  PROBLEM D UE TO PARALELL W INDINGS  \nImpact of eddy currents on copper losses of a high \nfrequency has been widely studied. Several analytical methods \nhave been proposed to account for these effects, especially \nwhen windings can be represented as stacks of conductive \nlayers insulated from each other [4, 5]. They all start from the \nsolution of propagation equation in an infinite plan layer made \nof conductive linear homogenous and isotropic material. For \none layer, total losses split into skin and proximity losses.  \nIn a transformer, when wires are connected in parallel, \nadding skin and proximity losses of all wires leads to total \ncopper losses only if currents flowing in all wires connected in \nparallel have not been supposed equal from the beginning. \nIndeed, as explained above, circulation currents add to the \nmean current per wire so skin losses must be calculated with \nthe real current that flows in it. \nRecently we presented the effect of circulating currents into \na 9 kVA, 125-kHz, planar transformer (Fig. 1) [6]. This \nindustrial transformer includes 44 conductive layers. Its PQ \ncore [7] is made of ferrite PC40. This component has two \nsecondaries, each made of 11 paralleled layers. Its primary is \nmade of 11 pairs of layers. Each pair is wired in parallel, then, \nall these pairs are connected in series. Due to external circuit, \nwhile one secondary is loaded (output current : 275 Aeff ), the \nother is in open circuit. The loaded is modeled by a 0.12 Ω  \nresistance. \n \nThis work is supported by THALES Airborne System \nCentre Amiral Nomy, 10 Avenue de la 1ère DFL, 29283 Brest, France \n \nFigure 1.  44-conductive layers, 3 windings planar transformer \nEleven primary layers are located above and eleven under \nthe secondaries.

The maximal current value (80 Aeff ), which \nappears for the external layer of the loaded winding, is more \nthan three times higher so, power losses in this layer is ten \ntimes than expected. For the open circuit winding, despite \nnominal current is null (Fig. 2 shows only modulus!), currents \nin layers 12 and 22 reach 40 Aeff . \nEven if it doesn't impact on transformer efficiency (still \nabove 98.5 %), this catastrophic current sharing results in \nstrongly localized extra losses (Fig. 3), even in the open circuit \nsecondary. That creates hot points into PCB and, sometimes, \ndestroys the transformer. \n2nd secondary \n(Open circuit) \n1st secondary \n(Loaded)\n2nd secondary \n(Open circuit) \n1st secondary \n(Loaded)\n \nFigure 3.

H OW TO PREDICT C IRCULATION C URRENTS ? \nThe impact of circulating currents may be destructive for \ntransformer. Designers have to predict them while they are \ndimensioning their components. \nA.  Limits of fem Simulations \nTraditional method for determining circulation current is \nbased on fem simulation. Introducing planar transformer \ngeometry in software is quite easy but it is a long task. Besides, \nmeshing of such a component (for example the 44 layers one) \nmust place 2 mashes in a skin depth to properly account for \neddy currents. As a consequence, calculation requires a large \nmemory size computer. In practice, the major problem arises \nwhen geometrical optimizations are carried out. In order to find \nthe best topology for loss reduction, numerous simulations \nhave to be run [9, 10] and both description and computation \ntimes are often prohibitive.  \nIn order to reduce transformer's development and \noptimization time, we looked for an analytical method \nconvenient to easily and quickly check different topologies. \nB.  Analytical Method : 1-D propagation assumption \n1)  Principe \nLooking at its 2D cross section, a planar transformer can be \nseen as a stack of different types of layers made of conducting, \ninsulating or magnetic material (Fig. 4). Each material is \nconsidered as linear, homogeneous, isotropic and it is described \nby its complex permeability and its complex permittivity.  \nMagnetic \nInsulator \nInsulator \nConductor : primary (1) \nConductor : primary (2) \nConductor : secondary (1) \nInsulator \nInsulator \nInsulator \nConductor : secondary (2) \nConductor : secondary (3) \nInsulator \nMagnetic  \nFigure 4.  Example of layer stack \nAssuming energy propagation is 1-D (normal to the layers) \n[11, 12], power exchange of a layer is defined, by 6 parameters \nlinearly linked: electric and magnetic fields on each faces, and \nsupplied current and voltage (if the layer is conductive). Such \nan approach leads to a 3-port equivalent circuit that \nsynthetically represents all energy transfers of a layer. \nIn order to develop this unidirectional approach, let’s \nconsider an infinite plane layer of thickness a , perpendicular \nto Oz  axis. A portion of this layer (height b  and depth c ) is \ntaken into account (Fig. 5). This plate is exposed to plane \nwaves (incident and reflected) on its two faces. Magnetic field \nH  is parallel to Oy  while electric field E  is directed toward \nOx . If this plate is a conductive one, a conduction courant can \nflow inside. This layer is submitted to three power flux: one at \nthe input, one at the output and the third is injected. \n \nFigure 5.  One layer \nRelations between the six external variables (gE  and gH  \nat the input, dE  and dH  at the output, V and I) can be written \nas a 3x3 matrix which is associated to a passive 3-port circuit. \nHowever, Ampere’s theorem shows that current I  is linked to \nmagnetic excitation ( gH  and dH ) on both faces (1). \nJHH dg =−  (1) \nAs a consequence, matrix relation is reduced to a couple of \nequations (2) [11] that can be represented by a 2-port circuit \n(Fig. 6). \nJZHZEE gsg ⋅+⋅=− 21  \nJZHZEE dsd ⋅+⋅−=− 21  \n(2) \nwith  b\nIJ −=  and c\nVE s −=  b\nc\nJ\nE\nI\nVZ s==⇔  (3) \n1Z 1Z\n2Z\nsE\nJgE dE\ngH dH\n \nFigure 6.

However, at \nlong as we focus essentially on copper losses such \nsophisticated models are useless.

Depth c  is taken \nequal to average turn length. Height b  is equal to layer's width. \nEach layer is separated from the others by an insulating zone \nwhich has the same permeability than air. Turns number of \nprimary and secondary are introduced in the equivalent circuit \nby the mean of coupler ratios [12] which links the layer to its \npower supply.

Comparison of current repartition in secondary layers \nThis simulation gives very good results. Current in the load \nis equal to 275 A eff  and the repartition obtained with fem \nsoftware is quite similar to that deduced from our equivalent \ncircuit representation introduced in circuit simulation software \n(difference less than 5%). The most interesting aspect of this \n\"analytical simulation\" is that it is very fast. Computing time is \nless than 20 s and this can be advantageously compared to the \n20 min necessary to run an fem simulation. Introduction of \nsuch model into a circuit software is also simpler (and faster) \nbecause numerous identical cells can be repeated. \nIn the final part of this paper, different layer stacks will be \ncompared in order to reduce circulation currents and to \nimprove transformer reliability. \nIV.  PLANAR TRANSFORMER STUDIES  \nA.  Reduction of circulation currents  \nCirculation currents are due to leakage flux enclosed by \nparallel layers and these flux increase with the distance \nseparating two conductive layers. So, best solution appears to \nbe the use only one thick layer with the total copper thickness! \nIn standard transformers, one alternative solution consists in \ntwisting wires such as in Litz wires. This does reduce the flux \nembraced by each pair of wires but it is not applicable for PCB \nwindings. \nThe second solution consists in modifying winding \narrangement to reduce the leakage inductance of the \ntransformer [14]. This is achieved by interleaving primary and \nsecondary to locally cancel Ampere-turns. This solution, which \nreduces rms induction in the transformer window when one \nwinding is shorted, decreases stored energy and leakage \ninductance. It also reduces eddy current losses which are \nroughly proportional to this rms induction. \nB.  Layer stack improvements \nImpact of interleaving is now tested using our equivalent \ncircuit method. All layers stay at the location occupied in the \n44-layer transformer but they are connected differently. This \nleads to the three different layer stacks shown in Fig. 11.  \nP1 \nP2 \nP3 \nP4 \nP5 \nSA1 \nSA2 \nSA3 \nSA4 \nSA5 \nSA6 \nSA7 \nSA8 \nSA9 \nSA10 \nSA11 \nSB1 \nSB2 \nSB3 \nSB4 \nSB5 \nSB6 \nSB7 \nSB8 \nSB9 \nSB10 \nSB11 \nP6 \nP7 \nP8 \nP9 \nP10 \nP11 \n \nP1 \nP2 \nSA1 \nSA2 \nSB1 \nSB2 \nP3 \nP4 \nSA3 \nSA4 \nSB3 \nSB4 \nP5 \nP6 \nSA5 \nSA6 \nSB5 \nSB6 \nP7 \nP8 \nSA7 \nSA8 \nSB7 \nSB8 \nP9 \nP10 \nSA9 \nSA10 \nSB9 \nSB10 \nP11 \nSA11 \nSB11 \n \nP1 \nSA1 \nSB1 \nP2 \nSA2 \nSB2 \nP3 \nSA3 \nSB3 \nP4 \nSA4 \nSB4 \nP5 \nSA5 \nSB5 \nP6 \nSA6 \nSB6 \nP7 \nSA7 \nSB7 \nP8 \nSA8 \nSB8 \nP9 \nSA9 \nSB9 \nP10 \nSA10 \nSB10 \nP11 \nSA11 \nSB11 \n \n(a) (b)  (c) \nFigure 11.  Connections of the 44 conductive layers of the 3-winding \ntransformer. (a) : initial design | (b) : arrangement 1 | (c) : arrangement 2 \n \nThe first one (Fig. 11-a) describes the initial planar device. \nEach primary layer in the figure is composed of two parallel \nlayers. Secondaries are both placed between the two half-\nprimaries. The second design (Fig. 11-b) is obtained by \ninterleaving 2 primary layers, 2 \"A\" secondary layers and 2 \"B\" \nsecondary layers. The third one (Fig. 11-c) consists in \ninterleaving the three winding layers one by one. According to \nour guiding idea, this last arrangement seems to be the ideal \none but can not always be done because of manufacturing \nreasons. \nComparison between theses different arrangements can be \nrealized very quickly with the use of circuit simulation \nsoftware. Only connections between plates must be modified to \nachieve different arrangements.  \nFig. 12 presents the comparison of currents in secondary A \n(loaded winding). Both arrangements 1 and 2 lead to quite \nequal currents in parallel layers.  \nInitial design \nArrangement 1 \nArrangement 2 \nCurrent modulus (Aeff )\nLayer number \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 0\n10 \n20 \n30 \n40 \n50 \n60 \n70 \n80 \n  \nFigure 12.

This values doesn’t include losses \nin the PCB vias and in the magnetic core.   \nC.  Final optimized transformer  \nOwing to our equivalent circuit method, connection \nbetween layers as well as thickness of insulating and \nconductive layers can be changed easily and quickly. However, \nthe solution showing lowest losses is not necessary the one that \nengineers adopt. Other industrial considerations are taken into \naccount such as volume, weight, cost, …. The study of this 44-\nlayers planar transformer has been proposed by Thales and it \ngave us the opportunity of working with Thales engineers to \nimprove their component. After balancing best efficiency \nsolution with cost and ease of manufacturing, they built the \ncomponent described below (Fig. 14). \nThis component is made of a smaller number of layers. \nBoth secondary are made of 6 parallel layers. Thickness of \nPCB layers have been increased (surface x1.5) to sustain \n275/6 = 45.8 Aeff . Arrangement of primary and both secondary \nis a mix (2 primaries-1 secondary A-1 secondary B) between \nFig. 11-b and Fig. 11-c. Final performances are presented \nbelow.  \n \nFigure 14.  24-layers optimized transformer \nCurrents repartitions in secondary layers are presented in \nFig. 15 for the loaded secondary, and in Fig. 16 for the open \ncircuit secondary. On these figures, results obtained with fem \nsoftware are compared with those deduced using circuit \nsimulation software. Results are in very good agreement. \n0 1 2 3 4 50\n10 \n20 \n30 \n40 \n50 \n60 \nCurrent modulus (Aeff )\nLayer number \nfem simulation \nAnalytical model \nNominal value   \nFigure 15.  Currents repartition in optimized 24-layer planar transformer \n(Secondary A) \nCurrent in loaded windings is included between 30 Aeff  and \n55 Aeff  . This values must be compared to the nominal value : \n45.8 A eff . In the open circuit secondary, current is included \nbetween 2 Aeff  and 13 A eff . Copper losses are close to 20.6 W \nand, according to measurements, power efficiency seems to be \nslightly above 99 %. \n Compared to the first prototype, better performances and \nreliability are obtained (lower copper losses, reduce hot spots) \nand this component is easier to manufacture.  \n0 1 2 3 4 50\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10 \n12 \n14 \nLayer number \nCurrent modulus (Aeff )\nfem simulation \nAnalytical model \nNominal value   \nFigure 16.

These currents appear \nas soon as at least one winding is made of strands connected in \nparallel. They are never taken into account in analytical \napproaches. They can be studied by f.e.m. simulations \nproviding equality of currents circulating in parallel strands is \nnot imposed from the beginning. \nDespite paralleling winding seems to be a good solution to \nreduce eddy current effects while sustaining high frequency \nstrong currents, impact of circulation currents must be \nevaluated to avoid destructive hot spots. This evaluation is long \nand quite incompatible with an optimization process when it is \ndone using traditional approach (analytical and f.e.m. \nsimulation). \nIn this paper, an exact analytical approach has been \nformatted to appear as a circuit problem that can be solved \nusing standard circuit simulation software. This method, based \non the 1-D propagation assumption, leads to an equivalent \ncircuit suitable to determine all layer currents, including \ncirculation ones. Owing to this tool, checking concurrent \ntopologies for a planar transformers with given specification is \neasy and fast. Using it, engineers can save a lot of time. \nSince this paper have been proposed, equivalent circuit \nmethod has been extended and it is now usable with non \nharmonic waveforms. This will be published soon. \n \n \nR EFERENCES  \n[1]  C. Wei, Y. Yipen, H. Yuenquan, L.
