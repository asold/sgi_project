    "abstract": "Introduction Detecting and accurately diagnosing early melanocytic lesions is challenging due to extensive intra- and inter-observer variabilities. Dermoscopy images are widely used to identify and study skin cancer, but the blurred boundaries between lesions and besieging tissues can lead to incorrect identification. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, including vision transformers, have been proposed as a solution, but variations in symptoms and underlying effects hinder their performance. Objective This scoping review synthesizes and analyzes the literature that uses vision transformers for skin lesion detection. Methods The review follows the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Revise) guidelines. The review searched online repositories such as IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed to retrieve relevant articles. After screening and pre-processing, 28 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included. Results and discussions The review found that the use of vision transformers for skin cancer detection has rapidly increased from 2020 to 2022 and has shown outstanding performance for skin cancer detection using dermoscopy images. Along with highlighting intrinsic visual ambiguities, irregular skin lesion shapes, and many other unwanted challenges, the review also discusses the key problems that obfuscate the trustworthiness of vision transformers in skin cancer diagnosis. This review provides new insights for practitioners and researchers to understand the current state of knowledge in this specialized research domain and outlines the best segmentation techniques to identify accurate lesion boundaries and perform melanoma diagnosis. These findings will ultimately assist practitioners and researchers in making more authentic decisions promptly.",
