Through these findings, this study \nnot only elucidates the mechanism of narrative generation in data utilization processes but also provides a foundation for \nimproving human–AI collaboration.\nKeywords Data utilization · Narrative generation · Hierarchical narrative representation\n1 Introduction\n1.1  Background\nThis paper proposes a perspective that views the relation-\nship between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) agents \nas a process of data co-utilization. We argue that data use \ninvolves generating narratives from this joint utilization \nand elucidate the mechanism of narrative generation. This \nunderstanding can, in turn, foster more effective relation-\nships between humans and AI agents.\nIn recent years, narratives have been increasingly utilized \nas powerful tools for influencing individuals and societies. \nThe effectiveness of storytelling has been summarized in \nthat it can move and persuade people and produce results \n[Pierosara (2022)]. One of the reasons for the effectiveness \nis that an excellent competitive strategy demands a narrative \nstory that shows images moving toward a goal as a whole \ncomposed of elements interacting with each other ([Kusu -\nnoki (2010)] p. v). Further more, narratives have demon-\nstrated the reciprocal relationship between theoretical enti-\nties and cultures [Heelan (1998), Ginev (2020), Sartori and \nTheodorou (2022 )]. Additionally, it has been argued that \nstorytelling can effectively address both certain and uncer -\ntain aspects simultaneously [Rasmussen (2005)].\nA set of related terms used in this context includes nar -\nrative, story, scenario, and storytelling. We use the term \nnarrative rather than story  when focusing not only on the \nmeaning of the whole composed of elements but also on the \nunderstanding of the elements or the whole, such as recog-\nnizing a pattern from the elements [Cambridge University \nPress & Assessment (2022)]. Thus, narrative generation is \nthe construction of a whole that is or will be composed of \nelements based on some understanding. When we focus on \n“possible actions or events in the future” [Cambridge Uni-\nversity Press & Assessment (2023)], we refer to them as \n * Kaira Sekiguchi \n kaira@sys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n1 Department of Systems Innovation, School of Engineering, \nThe University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-Ku, \nTokyo 113-8656, Japan\n3188 AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208\nscenarios. Finally, storytelling signifies the act of conveying \na story, narrative, or scenario that already exists or is being \ngenerated.\nData utilization involves the extraction of knowledge \n[Fayyad et al. (1996)], chances [Ohsawa (2002)], and their \npatterns [Ohsawa et al. (2021)] through a process. Here, the \nterm data utilization is not limited to the analysis phase but \nencompasses the entire process of dealing with data, includ-\ning the synthesis of meanings. This extraction has been \nbecoming increasingly focused on actionable outcomes, \nnecessitating a deeper understanding of abstract patterns. \nIn this context, we position the generation of narratives as a \nvital extension of these data utilization trends.\nThe role of AI in this narrative generation process is cru-\ncial. Many AI systems use data as a knowledge base and \nsource for model creation. As highlighted by [Jordan and \nMitchell (2015)], advancements in machine learning—\ndriven by the sheer size of current data, low-cost computa-\ntion, new algorithms, and related theory—have significantly \nenhanced this capability. A recent notable example is Large \nLanguage Models (LLMs). By integrating such AI agents, \nthe extraction of knowledge, chances, patterns, and narra-\ntives becomes more scalable and impactful. Furthermore, \naddressing the risks associated with AI agents, such as \ndamaging human autonomy and turning the data utilization \nprocess into a black box, is imperative in this framework. \nUnderstanding the interplay between AI agents and data is \ncrucial for mitigating these risks and ensuring the generation \nof desirable outcomes.\nIn conclusion, extracting narratives from data is key to \nfostering more effective relationships between humans and \nAI agents. This paper elucidates how this process can be \nrealized and highlights the essential roles that both AI agents \nand humans play in this context.\n1.2  Our approach\nAlthough the aforementioned narrative extraction from data \nusing AIs is significant, its mechanism has not been straight-\nforwardly elucidated. If we can find a way to intentionally \nguide the narrative generation process, it will be valuable \nfor constructing better relationships between humans and \nAI agents during data co-utilization. Therefore, we define \nthe research problem of narrative generation for socially \nvaluable actions in the context of data utilization as follows:\nProblem Definition: Generate a narrative representing the \nactions and events in the causalities from/to the elements \ndescribed below:\nElement 1: Requirements (social demands in real life of \nhuman(s)) that correspond to a higher level of understanding \nof the data to be analyzed.\nElement 2: Technical elements that correspond to raw \nmaterials such as the data to be analyzed and algorithms.\nElement 3: Multilevel goals and solutions (goals, sub-\ngoals, and methods to achieve them) that make the above \nrequirements easier to fulfill.\nTo address these issues, we propose hierarchical nar -\nrative representation (HieNaR) as a framework. HieNaR \nhas twelve levels: set of texts, text, subtext, sentence, sub-\nsentence, word, subword, character, subcharacter, stroke, \nsubstroke, and particle levels.\nConsequently, we define the three states of HieNaR: \nraw, descriptive, and patterned states. In the raw state, \nraw materials are represented. This state corresponds to \nboth linguistic and numerical data representation when \ndealing with raw materials. Here, the linguistic case deals \nwith data described in natural language. A typical exam-\nple is networked graph-type visualization with words as \nnodes. The numerical case  deals with numerical data, \nand typical examples include visualization using scatter \nplots, line charts, and histograms. In the descriptive state, \nthe descriptive explanation of raw materials is presented. \nThis state is particularly important in the numerical case \nbecause numerical data initially has little descriptive infor -\nmation in its representation. In the patterned state, a pat-\ntern that can be articulated from the raw or descriptive \nmaterials is represented.\nAn overview of HieNaR is shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, we \ndescribe HieNaR levels vertically. Then, we describe the \nthree states horizontally. The raw materials of the represen-\ntation are shown on the left. In the center, we provide a \ndescriptive explanation of the raw materials. On the right, \nwe present the patterns. In this context, the word level cor -\nresponds to the granularity of the smallest independent \nmeaningful unit in the narrative structure. Therefore, this \ncase introduces a visualization of six levels out of the twelve \nlevels in HieNaR, from the word level upwards.\nIn Fig. 1, the requirements (Element 1) of data utilization \ncorrespond to the upper-right levels, i.e., the sentence, text, \nand set of texts levels at which we aim to discover knowl-\nedge, chances, or their patterns from data. The technical \nelement (Element 2) corresponds to the lower-left side of \nFig. 1. Here, we introduce a level that is explicitly expressed \nin the data utilization process, which is called the expressed \nlevel. For example, the expressed level of the scattered plot \nin Fig.  1 is the word level. Another example is a network \ngraph whose granularity of the nodes corresponds to a key \nphrase and has the subsentence level as the expressed level. \nThen, multilevel goals (Element 3) corresponding to lev -\nels and states are shown in the lower-left and upper-right \nrepresentations.\nIdeally, data utilization is achieved by working backward \nfrom the upper right to lower left. However, actual data uti-\nlization is subject to trial and error. Therefore, the process is \nexpected to be a cyclical back-and-forth movement between \nthese upper-right and lower-left representations. To present \n3189AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \nthis cyclic process along the time axis, we added a new \ndimension in Sects. 2.3 and 2.4.\n1.3  Expected use case of HieNaR\nIn this section, we semantically describe the contents of \nFig. 1, which shows an example of HieNaR use. The exam-\nple analyzes the relationship between electricity demand \nand temperature. In the bottom left area, the horizontal axis \nrepresents the daily maximum temperature (°C), while the \nvertical axis depicts the daily maximum electricity demand \n(MW). Here, we applied the scatter plot. In this case, the \nexpressed level is the word level because each plot and the \nhorizontal and vertical axes can be articulated at the word \n(smallest independent meaningful unit) level when dealing \nwith the scatter plot.\nIn the center of HieNaR, we present the explanation of \nraw materials, which we refer to as the descriptive state. At \nthe sentence level, the electricity demand increases when \ntemperatures are high and low due to cooling or heating \nneeds. In contrast, supply and demand are relatively less \nsevere at moderate temperatures, which is more comfort-\nable for people’s lives. Then, at the subtext level, we group \nthe cold and hot conditions as severe ones. The entire text \ncan be described at the text level. We assume that there \nmight be other narratives related to the same worldviews, \ndescribed as “…” in the graph.\nThen, we extract patterns from the raw materials and \nthe descriptive explanations. For example, as shown at the \ntext level in the patterned state in Fig.  1, the relationship \nbetween temperature and electricity demand is known to \nbe a V-shaped (or U-shaped) curve as discussed in [Moral-\nCarcedo and Vic´ens-Otero (2005), Bessec and Fouquau \n(2008)]. In this study, we refer to this curve as a smiling \ncurve (or a smirk curve if the curve is skewed) due to its \n shape1. We use this term because this characteristic repre -\nsentation enhances the stimulation of narrative generation.\nBased on this, we construct a narrative at the text level \nthat “a smiling curve to show the trend of chances to solve \nenergy problems leading to a sustainable society.” Fur -\nthermore, we predict the social value to be realized. For \ninstance, we posit that addressing the entire text corre-\nsponds to a vision for sustainable energy usage, such as \nrealizing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7: Ensure \naccess to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern \nFig. 1  Upper six levels and three states in HieNaR. The levels are described vertically; the states are described horizontally. The ideal data utili-\nzation process is backcasting from the top right to the bottom left, but in reality, it is a cycle between the two\n3190 AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208\nenergy for all. This framing serves as the worldview for \ngenerating narratives.\nIn summary, the essence of HieNaR is the levels. Three \nstates are necessary to capture a detailed picture of the entire \ndata utilization process. Another example dealing with a lin-\nguistic case is provided in the Appendix.\n1In the finance field, a similar graph shape for implied \nvolatility is called smile (or smirk) (e.g., shown in [Li \net al. (2021)]). Implied volatility is the volatility calculated \nby option trading in the market. Its graph shows the strike \nprice on the horizontal axis and the volatility value on the \nvertical axis. This curve also has a smile-like shape.\n1.4  Related work\nNarrative generation in data utilization is a complex pro-\ncess. Despite its significance, the mechanisms underlying \nthis process have not been fully elucidated. Our research \naddresses this gap by proposing a framework that eluci-\ndates the connections between abstract concepts, including \nworldviews, and raw materials such as concrete data. This \napproach enhances the explicability of data utilization, lead-\ning to more strategically operable data utilization processes. \nAn example of such a worldview is the expression of social \nvalues within narratives. Furthermore, our work seeks to \ndelineate the roles and mutual influences of humans and \nAI agents in narrative generation, contributing to a better \nunderstanding and improvement of autonomy in human–AI \ncollaboration.\n1.4.1  Social values and social good\nWhen narratives are generated with the intention of real-\nizing social good, HieNaR effectively supports this process \nby visualizing the structure of scenarios that incorporate \nsocial values. Although social value and social good are \nrelated concepts, they are distinct. Social value refers to \nwhat is articulated within an entire system at the scale of \na whole society, which can vary across contexts and can be \nexpressed without necessarily determining its moral worth \n[Sekiguchi and Hori (2020), Sekiguchi (2022)]. This use \ndraws inspiration from linguistic perspectives, where value  \nis determined by differential relationships within a system, \nrather than inherent worth or moral judgments [Saussure \n(1959)]. Additionally, in relation to technology and society, \n[Poel (2020)] suggested that a social value can be positive \nor negative and depends on social, cultural, and historical \nphenomena as well as technological and personal contexts, \nand it evolves from time to time.\nThen, research presented in [Floridi et al. (2020)] argued \nthat social good is that which has a positive or nonnega-\ntive impact on human life, the natural world, society, and/\nor the environment. And they noted that what constitutes a \nsocially good outcome is likely to be subject to disagreement \nand contention. Then, to make AI socially beneficial (good), \nresearch presented in [Floridi and Cowls (2019)] emphasized \nthe importance of ensuring human autonomy and ensuring \nthat AI-related phenomena are explicable (intelligible and \naccountable), along with the principles of beneficence, non-\nmaleficence, and justice. Additionally, they argued that situ-\nating these ethical principle to concrete actions is crucial.\nBy hierarchically connecting abstract worldviews to \nconcrete data, HieNaR enhances the explicability of data \nutilization in expressing social values for realizing social \ngood. This framework facilitates more strategic operability \nby enabling us to construct narrative structures more clearly.\n1.4.2  Scenario building and autonomy\nThere are various ways to approach narratives in relation to \nAI and society, such as building scenarios and investigating \nmoral dimensions. First, narrative-based future scenarios \nhave been investigated to assist individuals in grasping \nfuture probabilities and improving their capacity to respond \nto future events. For example, storytelling techniques were \nused for scenario building, where it is important to consider \nto whom the scenario is relevant, the multiple contexts flow-\ning behind the scenario of the story, and the facilitator’s \nrole in externalizing these hidden anticipations [Rasmussen \n(2005)]. The design of collaborative interfaces was demon-\nstrated to facilitate co-creation and conflict reconciliation \n[Stock et al. (2009)].\nSecond, regarding the moral dimensions of narratives, \nspecific subjects, such as the autonomy of AI and the trust \nof humans, have been addressed. For example, the difference \nbetween human autonomy and AI autonomy is essentially \nshown in the way stories are narrated, and it is argued that \nhuman narratives are open to the future, whereas AI narra-\ntives are merely combinations based on past data [Pierosara \n(2022)]. Narratives and technologies reflect the social struc-\nture and provide insights into existing inequalities that can \nbe automated through advanced algorithmic and AI meth-\nods [Sartori and Theodorou (2022)]. Therefore, these studies \nconsider narratives to be a key to tackling problems, such \nas addressing stereotypes. Furthermore, a method that inte-\ngrates both aspects was introduced [Copeland and de Moor \n(2018)]. This work expanded a storytelling workshop tech-\nnique, namely community digital storytelling, by integrat-\ning a concept known as the storytelling cycle of trust. This \napproach has broadened the scope of storytelling, amplified \nits influence, and enhanced its impact both within communi-\nties and broader society.\nWhile these studies have made significant contributions \nto scenario building and narrative analysis, they have not \nfully addressed the specific mechanisms of narrative genera-\ntion process in data utilization. Our work addresses this gap \n3191AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \nby proposing a systematic framework that merges scenario-\nbuilding techniques with data utilization. This framework \nenhances explicability, thereby improving strategic operabil-\nity. Consequently, it fosters the preservation and advance-\nment of autonomy throughout the process.\n1.4.3   Hermeneutic circle, fusion of horizons \nand theoretical objects\nOne significant concept in understanding text is the her -\nmeneutic circle. Research presented in [Laverty (2003)] \ndescribes this as an evolving process of interpretation that \nemerges from the iterative movement between individual \nparts and the whole, with each aspect of understanding influ-\nencing the other. She also argues that because this cycle is \nevolving, interpreters need to understand their own position \nand trace their movement within it. Furthermore, in creativ-\nity support studies, this hermeneutic circle is considered cru-\ncial for aiding people, such as designers, in creative activi-\nties [Nakakoji (2006)].\nAnother important concept in textual understanding is the \nfusion of horizons [Laverty (2003)]. Hans-Georg Gadamer \npresented the concept of horizon as “the range of vision \nthat includes everything that can be seen from a particular \nvantage point” ([Gadamer (2004)] p. 301). He argued that \nunderstanding is fundamentally a historical event, achieved \nthrough the fusion of horizons in which one combines the \ntext’s horizon, rooted in the past, with one’s own horizon, \nwhich is continually forming (ibid. pp. 299, 305, 398). We \ncan apply this concept to describe the data utilization mecha-\nnism. In our terminology regarding the three hierarchies, the \nhorizon corresponds to the full range of the worldview level, \nwhile the vantage point corresponds to the standpoint within \nthe hierarchy of personal concerns.\nRegarding knowledge extraction from data, there is a \nlongstanding question of how scientists interpret experimen-\ntal data. One trend is the adoption of hermeneutics, which \nposits that scientists, including natural scientists, interpret \ndata, or more broadly, the world, as if they were reading a \ntext. This shift towards an interpretation-based approach is \nknown as the hermeneutic turn [Noe (1998)]. For exam-\nple, Patrick A. Heelan, drawing on Heidegger’s philosophy, \nargued that theory shapes history and culture, which in turn \nshape the practice of theory [Heelan (1998)]. Additionally, \nhe discussed the role of technology in the form of theory-\nbased technology, including obtained data, as readable tech-\nnologies. Dimitri Ginev expanded on Heelan’s argument, \ncontending that these readable technologies transform theo-\nretical objects into visualized entities [Ginev (2020)].\nTherefore, we can consider that understanding narratives \nin data utilization also emphasizes the important role of the \nfusion of worldviews―one’s own with those of others, \nincluding theory-based views such as those of AI agents. \nHowever, the fusion of horizons among the three elements \n(i.e., one’s own worldview, others’ worldviews, and theo-\nretical views) has not been visually elucidated in a narrative \nstructure in relation to the data utilization process. Our work \nendeavors to address this gap as part of our approach to the \nresearch problem.\n1.4.4  Roles of humans and AI agents\nHuman–AI collaboration has emerged as a significant trend \nin AI research, proposing that the goal is to achieve superior \nperformance through synergy rather than replacing humans \nwith AI. This approach recognizes the unique strengths of \nboth human and machine intelligence. A notable example \nis the concept of hybrid intelligence proposed by [Deller -\nmann et al. (2019)], which is based on the understanding \nthat human intelligence is flexible, creative, empathic, etc., \nwhereas machine intelligence is speedy, large-scale, consist-\nent, etc.\nSuch collaboration is diligently implemented and \nexplored in creative activity support studies, including the \nenhancement of human cognition that is crucial for consider-\ning the narrative generation process.\nKoichi Hori demonstrated that an AI system can sup-\nport new concept formation by interactively visualizing \nspatial arrangements of words, providing alternative views, \nand offering stimuli to its user [Hori (1994)]. It has been \nshown that such a creativity support process aligns with the \ninteractive process modeled as a double helix [Ohsawa and \nNara (2003)]. In this model, two intertwined spirals pro -\ngress simultaneously: one represents the human’s process \nof having concerns and becoming aware of new chances \nthrough context-shifting cycles, while the other represents \nthe computer’s process of data processing and visualization. \nFurther research has emphasized the critical role of human-\ndriven requirements (i.e., feature concepts) in data utilization \n[Ohsawa et al. (2021)].\nRecent AI models have shown significant advancements, \nyet they still face certain limitations. Luciano Floridi and \nMassimo Chiriatti noted that models like GPT-3 (i.e., third \ngeneration of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer) \nencounter challenges in mathematical, semantic, and ethi-\ncal tasks [Floridi and Chiriatti (2020)]. However, they also \nsuggested that these limitations do not preclude effective \nhuman–AI collaboration. Kumiyo Nakakoji’s categorization \nof creativity support tools into three distinct types—dumb-\nbells, running shoes, and skis—provides a comprehensive \nframework for analyzing how AI can enhance human crea-\ntive processes [Nakakoji (2006)]. Dumbbells represent tools \nthat develop creative skills, running shoes symbolize those \nthat enhance performance during creation, and skis embody \ntechnologies that enable novel creative experiences. This \n3192 AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208\nanalogy effectively illustrates the multifaceted ways AI tools \ncan support creativity.\nThis study is also grounded in these assertions. Regard-\ning the roles of humans and AI agents in data utilization, \nhumans are expected to bring concerns and requirements \naligned with their worldviews and to manifest their own cre-\nativity which is open to the future in the process. In contrast, \nAI agents can provide stimuli based on speedy, comprehen-\nsive, and consistent computations. Our research proposes \na framework that explicitly delineates these roles and their \nmutual influences in the narrative generation process.\n1.4.5  Narratives and hierarchical representation\nSome studies on information technology containing data sci-\nence were based on narratology, which is the field of nar -\nrative investigation. These studies focused on decomposing \nand composing stories to realize effective information access \n[Akaishi (2006), Akaishi et al. (2007)] and generating stories \n[Murai (2022)], and they succeeded in applying a hierarchi-\ncal way of thinking to model narratives.\nHowever, they did not explain the narrative generation \nmechanism in the data utilization process as their hierar -\nchies were not generalized to explain the various cases of \ndata utilization. Further, they used these narrative structures \nfor internal processing in computers, and their users only \nobtained results without an explicit representation of hier -\narchical structures.\nIn addition, various types of hierarchical representations \nexist. The hierarchical representation has been generally \ninvestigated in system [von Bertalanffy (1968), Kawamoto \n(1995)], linguistics [Halliday and Matthiessen (2004), Bur -\nton et al. (2012)] and design [Simon (1996), Sekiguchi and \nHori (2020), Sekiguchi (2022)] studies. These studies tend \nto define different hierarchies, whose integration would be \nhelpful in systematizing the narrative generation mechanism. \nWe, therefore, rearrange these hierarchies to explain the nar-\nrative generation mechanism in the data utilization process.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect.  2 \ndefines the HieNaR and discusses its characteristics; Sect. 3 \ndescribes the case study settings; Sect.  4 presents the case \nstudy results; Sect. 5 discusses the implications, limitations, \nand our future work; Sect. 6 provides conclusions. The glos-\nsary of the words defined in this paper is provided in Table 1.\n2  Definition and characteristics of HieNaR\nIn this section, we define HieNaR. First, we define its levels. \nNext, we classify the contents to be described at each level \nby dividing them into three states: raw materials, descrip-\ntions, and patterns.\n2.1  Twelve levels in HieNaR\nWe define HieNaR levels corresponding to the granularity \nof representation elements. Consequently, we define the \ntwelve HieNaR levels: set of texts, text, subtext, sentence, \nsubsentence, word, subword, character, subcharacter, stroke, \nsubstroke, and particle levels. Although various defini-\ntions of hierarchical representation exist, as introduced in \nSect. 1.4.5, we rearrange them to straightforwardly express \nnarrative structure, which can generally be applied to explain \nthe data utilization process. Table  2 presents an overview \nof the HieNaR levels, their semantic correspondences, and \nlinguistic examples.\nThe classifications of a set of texts, a text, and a sentence \nare clearly defined. Specifically, a text has boundaries as a \ncoherent whole, while any group of texts corresponds to \nthe set of texts level. Sentences are distinctly separated by \nperiods. It’s also important to note that for words, subwords, \ncharacters, and subcharacters, linguistically established def-\ninitions generally exist, allowing for clear differentiation. \nStrokes have definite starting and ending points, making \nthem easily distinguishable. Particles are determined by the \nphysical phenomena arising from the tools used for expres-\nsion, such as pens, printers, or displays. Examples of ele-\nments classified within these categories are also shown in \nTable 2.\nTo make HieNaR robust, we introduce buffer levels: sub-\ntext, subsentence, and substroke levels. These levels cor -\nrespond to various component lengths. For instance, the \nsubtext level can include paragraphs, sections, and chap-\nters, while the subsentence level encompasses phrases and \nclauses. Substrokes, while not always clearly delineated \nwithin continuous strokes, are also a crucial granularity. For \nexample, in calligraphy, substrokes such as stops, flicks, and \nsweeps are crucial elements that significantly influence the \naesthetic of the written characters. These sub-granularity \nlevels function as buffers when dealing with various text \ntypes and writing systems.\nHere, the text level corresponds to the narrative structure; \nhence, we call it the narrative level. Each sentence corre -\nsponds to a piece of knowledge as exemplified in [Fayyad \net al. (1996)]; thus, we call the sentence level the knowl-\nedge level. We call the set of texts level the worldview level \nbecause views common to a set of texts (narratives) cor -\nrespond to worldviews, which is the source of narrative \ngeneration.\nThen, the word level can be considered as the standard \nfor the granularity of the smallest independent meaningful \nunit. This allows us to establish that, even in quantitative \ncases, the granularity of components that possess a smallest \nindependent meaning corresponds to the word level. There-\nfore, in this paper, we focus on the word level and above. \nFor simplicity, our figures show the word level as the lowest \n3193AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \nTable 1  Glossary of this paper\nTerm Meaning\nData science Data science is a scientific field dealing with data utilization\nData utilization Data utilization involves the entire process of dealing with data, not just the analysis phase, and includes synthesiz-\ning meanings from data\nExpressed level The expressed level refers to the level that explicitly expresses raw materials of data in the data utilization process\nHieNaR HieNaR, an abbreviation for “hierarchical narrative representation,” which comprises twelve levels: set of texts, text, \nsubtext, sentence, subsentence, word, subword, character, subcharacter, stroke, substroke and particle levels\nHieNaR S3 HieNaR S3, an abbreviation for “HieNaR step-by-step sheet (HieNaR S3),” is a task sheet featuring a simplified ver-\nsion of HieNaR on a time axis\nLevels in HieNaR\n Set of texts level The set of texts level encompasses any group of texts, also referred to as the worldview level\n Text level The text level, aligned with the narrative structure, is called the narrative level, characterized by a text’s boundary as \na coherent whole\n Subtext level The subtext level includes various sentence granularities, such as paragraphs, sections, chapters, and parts\n Sentence level The sentence level, known as the knowledge level, comprises each sentence distinguished by periods and represents \nindividual pieces of knowledge\n Subsentence level The subsentence level comprises groups of words of varying lengths, such as phrases and clauses\n Word level The word level is defined by individual words, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives\n Subword level The subword level consists of units within words, such as roots, prefixes, and suffixes, contributing to word forma-\ntion and meaning\n Character level The character level comprises individual written symbols, including alphabets, Chinese characters, Japanese kana, \nnumerals, and punctuation\n Subcharacter level The subcharacter level includes components of complex characters, such as radicals and other elements in logo-\ngraphic systems\n Stroke level The stroke level consists of the fundamental units of written characters, including vertical lines, diagonal lines, and \npoints\n Substroke level The substroke level represents the detailed features of strokes, such as stops, flicks, and sweeps\n Particle level The particle level represents the smallest physical units of written or printed characters, such as ink drops and pixels\nNarrative generation Narrative generation is the construction of a whole that is or will be composed of substantial elements based on \nsome understanding\nShape of curves\n O-shaped curve The O-shaped curve, an advanced form of the V-shaped curve (which has a shape like the letter V), is characterized \nby its “O” shape\n Smile curve The smile curve, also known as a smirk curve when skewed, is named for its resemblance to a smiling mouth\nSocial good Social good is that which is deemed beneficial or positive among social values, based on contextual judgments\nSocial value Social value refers to what is articulated within an entire system at the scale of a whole society.

We further discuss the subword \nlevel and below in Sect. 5.5 and 5.7.\n2.2  Relationship between HieNaR and other \nhierarchies\nWhen investigating the narrative generation process for \nexpressing social values, we can consider two additional \nhierarchies alongside HieNaR: the hierarchical represen-\ntation of artifacts and that of personal concerns. Dfrome \noffers an exemplar of these two hierarchies [Sekiguchi and \nHori (2020), Sekiguchi (2022)]. Figure  2 illustrates the \nrelationship between these three types of hierarchies. The \nhierarchical representation of artifacts in Dfrome comprises \nseven levels: ethics, interaction, system, subsystem, sub-\nsubsystem, parts, and material, as shown in the middle of \nFig. 2. The ethics level corresponds to social impacts (i.e., \nsocial values). The interaction level pertains to impacts on \nhumans, such as users, participants, and citizens. The sys-\ntem and lower levels align with those addressed in systems \nengineering.\nThe other hierarchy in Dfrome addresses personal con-\ncerns. This dimension describes personal reasons and effects \nof the designed artifacts on stakeholders, corresponding to \nmotivations and incentives. Furthermore, these representa-\ntions of personal reasons and effects are defined to have a \nhierarchical structure, such as higher and lower levels of \nreasons [Sekiguchi (2022)].\nThese two hierarchies of Dfrome are orthogonal to each \nother. Dfrome is based on this three-dimensional representa-\ntion, as depicted at the bottom of Fig. 2, and adopts a simpli-\nfied version using projected images of the representation, as \nshown in the middle of Fig. 2.\nWe can position this simplified version of Dfrome’s hier-\narchies within each area of HieNaR, as shown at the top of \nFig. 2. Notably, concepts in the hierarchical representation \nof artifacts can be expressed at any granularity and in any \nstate in HieNaR, ranging from particles to sets of texts, \nand from raw materials to patterns. For example, a concept \nat the ethical level can be expressed as a single word like \n“less-energy,” one of whose patterns can be “sustainable”; \nor as a phrase such as “a society to use less-energy,” one of \nwhose patterns can be “a sustainable society.” This flexibil-\nity also applies to personal concerns, where a motivation can \nbe expressed as a phrase like “scientific curiosity,” one of \nwhose patterns can be “desire”; or as a sentence such as “I \naim to satisfy my scientific curiosity and become a scientist,” \none of whose patterns can be “Achieving self-realization.”\nTherefore, the choice of granularity and state in HieNaR \ncan be made independently from the other two hierarchies, \nrendering these three axes orthogonal to one another.\n2.3  Simplification of the three states in HieNaR\nAs described in Sects.  1.2 and 1.3, we further define the \nthree states of HieNaR, namely, the raw state, the descriptive \nstate, and the patterned state. Although the representation \nutilizing the whole levels to each state in Fig.  1 covers the \nfull information concerning the narrative generation mecha-\nnism in a step, it becomes too complex to handle with the \naddition of an axis of the shift of steps in the data utilization \nprocess. Therefore, we simplify the full version of HieNaR \nas one hierarchy, as shown in Fig. 3.\nIn this simplified version, each level is first dotted with \nthe frame of the area that represents each level. Then, the \nHieNaR user is required to trace the frame of the level with \na solid line, where the data are explicitly dealt with (rather \nthan in one’s mind or inside a machine), i.e., as the expressed \nlevel defined in Sect. 1.2. The levels with a dotted line above \nthe expressed level correspond to the descriptive and pat-\nterned states (i.e., our understanding of the expressed data).\nTable 2  Semantic \ncorrespondence of levels in \nHieNaR\nNo Level Semantic corre-\nspondence\nLinguistic example\n1 Set of texts Worldview Series, collections, libraries, etc\n2 Text Narrative Novels, essays, articles, etc\n3 Subtext Paragraphs, sections, chapters, etc\n4 Sentence Knowledge Declarative, interrogative, imperative sentences, etc\n5 Subsentence Phrases, clauses, etc\n6 Word Nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc\n7 Subword Prefixes, suffixes, roots, etc\n8 Character Alphabets, Chinese characters, Japanese kana, etc\n9 Subcharacter Radicals, components, etc\n10 Stroke Vertical lines, diagonal lines, points, etc\n11 Substroke Stops, flicks, sweeps, etc\n12 Particle Ink drops, pixels, etc\n3195AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \n2.4  Extension of HieNaR in time axis\nNext, HieNaR is extended in the time-axis direction because \nthe data utilization process can be considered as a step-by-\nstep process in which the relationships within the HieNaR \nof the visualized data and the relationships between the data \nand its external representations, such as inputs and outputs, \ngradually stabilize as the analysis proceeds.\nFurther, we design a task sheet called the HieNaR step-\nby-step sheet (HieNaR S3) through which we investigate \nFig. 2  Relationship between HieNaR and other hierarchies (Original images of the contents in the dotted area are from [Sekiguchi and \nHori (2020)])\n3196 AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208\nFig. 3  Simplified version of \nHieNaR\nFig. 4  Image of HieNaR S3 (the \nstep-by-step sheet)\n3197AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \nthe narrative generation mechanism in the data utilization \nprocess.

Here, the representation at each \nstep corresponds to the snapshot of HieNaR, as shown in \nFig. 3.\nHieNaR S3 corresponds to a process conducted by a sin-\ngle analyst because the parts of the descriptive and patterned \nstates correspond to one person’s understanding. When \ninvestigating a multicandidate case, such as a workshop, we \nuse a corresponding number of HieNaR S3s. Section  4.3 \ndescribes a case with three participants by investigating \nthree HieNaR S3s. There are detailed rules necessary for \nthe operational phase to utilize HieNaR and HieNaR S3. \nRefer to the Appendix for details.\n3  Case study settings\nWe tested the validity of HieNaR S3 (i.e., the twelve lev -\nels, the three states, and the temporal axis) for solving \nthe research problem defined in Sect.  1.2 by investigating \nwhether it could explain three specific phenomena related \nto the narrative generation in data utilization.\nThe three phenomena we dealt with included the possibil-\nity of expressing the social value of AI at various levels of \ngranularity in a narrative; the discrepancy between initially \nheld expectations and actual findings in the analysis (i.e., the \ncreation of conflicts with data), which triggers the next stage \nof creativity; the creation of new narratives in human–AI \ncollaboration through interactions based on their respective \nworldviews.\nThrough these cases, we also updated HieNaR to meet the \nexpectation of explaining the narrative generation mecha-\nnism in the data utilization process. Herein, we report the \nfinal equilibrium states of HieNaR and the explanation of \neach case.\nIn other words, this study is based on self-applicability: \nthe input data for HieNaR relates to the narrative generation \nin the data utilization process, and we aim to generate a nar-\nrative to understand its mechanism. Therefore, we studied \nthese representative cases in detail, considering their qualita-\ntive aspects. A quantitative investigation of this process will \nbe conducted in the future.\n3.1  Overview of the selected cases\nWe investigated three cases in the case studies. The first case \ndeals with finding a scenario leading to the ethics level using \nDfrome [Sekiguchi and Hori (2020)]. This case is significant \nconsidering the relationship between AI and society because \nDfrome deals with the ethical (i.e., socially valuable) design \nof AIs. In addition, Dfrome utilizes two types of hierarchies, \ni.e., the hierarchical representation of artifacts and the hier-\narchical representation of personal concerns. Through the \ninvestigation of this case, we could concretely organize three \ntypes of hierarchies including HieNaR.\nThe second case depicts a trial-and-error case to generate \na new understanding of the O-shaped curve, an advanced \ncase of the V-shaped curve. The third case is a collaborative \ncase conducted to realize the collaboration between humans \nand an AI agent in storytelling [Shakeri et al. (2021)]. The \nlatter two cases correspond to the creative triggers of the \nconflict in HieNaR, and the third case corresponds to the \ncollaboration between humans and an AI agent.\n4  Case study results\nThis section describes the case study results and discusses \neach case individually. One of the authors conducted the \ncase studies from August 2022 to September 2024 on his \nlaptop. We discuss these cases together in the next section.\n4.1  Case 1: finding a scenario to the ethics level \nusing Dfrome\nThe first case is concerned with finding a scenario leading to \nthe ethics level using Dfrome. Dfrome is a creativity support \ntool used to promote ethical design practice by field engi -\nneers (e.g., ethical AI design) [Sekiguchi and Hori (2020)]. \nHere, the term ethical design denotes the design considering \nthe social impacts of the designed artifacts.\nWhen using Dfrome, a user can describe design ideas. A \ndesign idea is described in an item in the form of a sentence. \nFor example, “Vehicle => fly in the sky” is to be described in \nan item using “ => ” to signify “be changed to” for a means, \nor “will change to” for an effect. The designer must connect \nthe items with other arrow types, such as “ → ,” depending \non the supposed causalities. For example, a causal arrow \ncan be described from the above idea to another idea, such \nas “Vehicle => fly in the sky → Roads => be less congested.” \nThen, a scenario is defined as a path comprising items and \narrows.\nThe main representation field in Dfrome is based on the \nhierarchical representation of artifacts that comprises the \ndimensions of the levels and comprehensive ideas, as shown \nin (A) and (C) in Fig. 5. Further, Dfrome has another dimen-\nsion for dealing with personal reasons, as shown in (P) in \nFig. 5. Here, we omit the areas for describing personal rea-\nsons and effects on the designer due to space limitations.\nIn this case, the task was to find an ethical scenario for \ndeveloping paragraph vectors [Le and Mikolov (2014)]. \nHere, the input data were considered as a tree comprising \nitems and arrows positioned at the system and lower levels. \nThis case aimed to identify items and arrows that rise to the \n3198 AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208\nethics level. The Dfrome function used in this study was \nscenario path recommendation, which supports designers \nin finding various ethical scenarios connected to the ethics \nlevel.\nFigure  5 presents the investigation results of the data \nutilization process. The node granularity is the sentence; \nthus, the expressed level becomes the sentence level. We \ncan describe the pattern of finding a scenario to the ethics \nlevel at the text level as a narrative pattern. In addition, we \ncan describe the pattern of promoting ethical AI design by \nfield engineers at the set of texts level (we omit “by field \nengineers” in Fig. 5 for space limitations) because this case \nconstructed the worldview of the original paper along with \nother presented cases, such as clarifying differences of struc-\ntures among AI ethics and design ideas, presenting distances \namong AI ethics and design ideas, and recommending sce-\nnario paths of risk scenarios [Sekiguchi and Hori (2020)]. \nFurther, we can consider that one scenario corresponds to \nthe subtext level because it corresponds to a path, and the \npath corresponds to a meaningful group of sentences, such \nas a paragraph.\nIn Step 1 in Fig. 5, the input data can be described at the \nsentence level. The expectations that rise to the ethics level \ncan be described at higher levels in the equilibrated state. \nThe original scenario and the expectation for the extend-\ning scenario can be described at the subtext level. Mean-\nwhile, the narrative and worldview patterns can be placed \nat the text and set of texts levels, respectively. In Step 2, the \nanalyst used the scenario path recommendation of Dfrome \nand sought a likable scenario upward. The green areas cor -\nrespond to Dfrome’s specification, that is, the screen turns \ngreen when the scenario path recommendation is used. Here, \nthe analyst checked whether the recommended scenario sat-\nisfied the narrative expectation and provided feedback on \nthe concrete materials and determined which recommended \nscenarios could be accepted. In Step 3, the analyst accepted \na scenario, but the obtained scenario did not reach the ethics \nlevel. Therefore, the analyst reused the scenario path recom-\nmendation to extend the tree, as shown in Step 4. Finally, the \nanalyst accepted one more scenario that reached the ethics \nlevel, as shown in Step 5. Using this analysis, the analyst \nobtained a scenario that goes “Paragraph vectors => provide \nFig. 5  Overview of the analysis process for the identification of a scenario connected to the ethics level using Dfrome. (see also [Sekiguchi and \nHori (2020)])\n3199AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \nstate-of-the-art results on several text classifications,” and \n“Society = > best honor human rights.”\nIn Fig. 5, the bottom right rectangle corresponds to the \noutput image. The understandings at the higher levels of \nHieNaR were added as handwritten drawings. These include \ndotted circles, an arrow, symbols, and a sentence explaining \nthe scenario paths.\nIn this case, the analyst employed the scenario path rec-\nommendation twice to identify a scenario connected to the \nethics level. Using HieNaR S3, these mechanisms could be \ndescribed as the relationships between the processing at the \nexpressed level and the expectations at higher levels (i.e., to \nsatisfy the expectations at the text level based on the world-\nview at the set of texts level). This case demonstrated that \nthe higher levels expecting to express social values (ethics \nlevel) are indeed crucial for introducing these values.\nThen, this case illustrated that the worldview level tends \nto remain constant throughout the data utilization process \ndue to the equilibrium maintained between the set of texts \nand text levels.\nAdditionally, the dimension of the personal view defined \nby Dfrome is orthogonal to the hierarchical representation \nof artifacts, as shown in (P) and (A) in Fig.  5. Therefore, \nthe three dimensions, artificial hierarchy, personal view, and \nnarrative structure (HieNaR), are orthogonal to one another \nas shown in Fig. 5.\n4.2  Case 2: Trial and error for a new understanding \nof the O‑shaped curve\nThe second case involves the demonstration of trial and error \nto generate a new understanding of the O-shaped curve. In \nthe abovementioned case, the higher-level expectations did \nnot change in the data utilization process. However, in actual \ndata utilization, data analysts often experience a conflict \nbetween the expectation and what the data show. Through \nresolving this conflict, they develop a new understanding of \nthe data. In this case, we dealt with an imaginary case that \nbegan with the expectation of obtaining a smiling curve.\nThe theme dealt with was the relationship between the \ntrends of “Fuyu-fuku” written in Japanese Kanji (“win-\nter clothes” in English) and the temperature in Tokyo. \nWe obtained the weekly trend data in Tokyo via Google \nTrends (https:// trends. google. co. jp/ trend s/? geo= JP) and \nthe weekly temperature data via the Japan Meteorological \nAgency (JMA) website (https:// www. data. jma. go. jp/ gmd/\nrisk/obsdl/), which corresponded to the Tokyo observation \npoint defined by the JMA. These data are downloadable in \nthe comma-separated values file format. We obtained these \ndata in October 2022. The sampling period was from Octo-\nber 15, 2017 to October 8, 2022.\nTo begin with, the analyst started by preparing the input \ndata with the expectation that he/she could obtain a smirk \ncurve of the relationship between winter clothes and tem-\nperature as a concrete case of commodity trends against \ntemperature as shown in Step 1 in Fig.  6. Here, the analyst \nanticipated that the curve would be skewed (i.e., the shape of \nthe left half of the smiling curve) because the trends seemed \nto rise when the temperature decreases and did not seem to \nrise even if the temperature increases.\nThe analyst visualized the data using a scatter plot in \nExcel and identified a conflict between these expectations \nand the results of the visualization, as shown in Step 2 in \nFig. 6. He/she had to find new knowledge to understand why \nthe upper and lower sides of the smirk curve were separated \nat the knowledge (sentence) level. At the narrative (text) \nlevel in Step 3, the analyst also had to explain why the data \ncollectively formed an O-shaped curve.\nTo answer these questions, the trial-and-error approach \nwas adopted as shown in Step 4 in Fig. 6. The intermediate \nobjective was to identify the data segments corresponding to \nthe upper and lower parts of the curve. The Filter function in \nExcel was useful because it allows one to easily extract some \nparts of the data and instantly update the graph.\nAlthough this process required trial and error (e.g., check-\ning various attributes to filter the data), little everyday or \nindustrial knowledge was helpful in solving the problem. \nFor example, we know that summer clothes go on sale before \nsummer is over. Shortly thereafter, fall and winter clothes \nare on the store shelves. This indicated a time lag (or phase \ndifference) between the rise in winter clothing trends and the \nactual fall in temperature. Thus, filtering the data by month \nworked well in this case. When the data were plotted on \nthe graph for each month, they were visualized as a circle \naround each part of the O-shape.\nIn Step 5, the analyst finally divided the data by month \nto clearly show the new understanding obtained. Figure  7 \npresents the actual graph. The number on each plot repre-\nsents the corresponding month. At the knowledge level, the \nanalyst could enhance and refine his/her understanding of \nhow the upper, lower, left, and right sides of the O-shaped \ncurve correspond to different aspects of the data, such as \n“the upper side corresponds to the growing trend to prepare \nin advance for cold weather,” “the lower side corresponds to \na ceasing trend in advance,” etc. Then, the analyst obtained \nthe understanding that the O-shaped smirk corresponds to \nthe cycle for seasonal changes at the narrative level.\nThus, HieNaR S3 elucidated the trial-and-error process \nin data utilization for narrative generation as a process of \nreconciliation between different levels of understanding.\n4.3  Case 3: Collaborative storytelling with GPT‑3\nThe third case involves collaboration between humans and \nan AI agent. The system used by the participants was a web \napplication called Shared Authoring GPT-3 Application \n3200 AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208\n(SAGA), a system for supporting asynchronous collabora-\ntive creative writing [Shakeri et al. (2021)]. The AI used in \nSAGA is a large language model (LLM), specifically GPT-3, \nwhich is the third generation of the Generative Pre-trained \nTransformer developed by OpenAI (https:// openai. com). \nGPT-3 allows human writers to generate text by providing a \nprompt, which was a piece of text, i.e., a storyline to make \ndistance-separated friends feel more connected in collabora-\ntive work. According to Shakeri et al., the challenges of crea-\ntive writing for human writers include the need for advanced \nFig. 6  Overview of the analysis process to perform trial and error for obtaining a new understanding of the O-shaped curve. The image with the \n“ ∗ ” mark corresponds to that in Fig. 7\nFig. 7  Finding an O-shaped \ncurve using Excel\n\n3201AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \nwriting skills, creativity, and extensive planning and prepa-\nration of elements, as well as the vulnerability of express-\ning oneself in the narrative. By collaborating with AI writ-\ners, human writers can alleviate the pressure of practicing \ncreative writing. In addition, the AI agent directs storylines \nin ways not intended by other human writers, allowing \nresearchers to experience the story generation process. This \nmeans that the story generation process and its output can \nbe more humorous, light-hearted, exciting, and fun. In that \nsense, SAGA can support the realization of creative writing.\nThe participants of the explained cases included the AI \nagent and two human writers: a friend of the researcher (P1) \nand one of the researchers of the project (P2). The theme \ndealt with was telling stories where the characters them-\nselves were the participants because this would help realize \nthe connection between distant participants. Through this \ncollaborative writing, it was also reported that human writers \ncould experience catharsis by expressing their own feelings \nand doing role-play, which is impossible in real life.\nThe procedure of collaborative writing was as follows. \nFirst, human participants coordinated for building the ini-\ntial prompt. Here, the initial prompt defined the basis of the \nstory, such as the setting, story genre, characters, etc. In this \ncase, the initial prompt instructed SAGA to act as a story -\nteller who tells stories of a specific genre in a specific set-\nting. Then, one participant wrote a prompt to drive the story \nforward, i.e., describing oneself as a story character. The AI \nagent took a turn to drive the story, e.g., describing events \nof the story world. Then, one participant wrote a prompt to \ndrive the story. The AI agent then took another turn to drive \nthe story. Through this process, human writers and the AI \nagent collaboratively generated the story.\nThe visualized image of a part of this creative writing \nprocess is shown in Fig.  8. HieNaR S3 at the top row cor -\nresponds to the AI agent’s behavior, whereas those at the \nsecond and third rows correspond to P1 and P2, respectively. \nThe expressed level here is the subtext level because the \nprompt was a piece of text (a sentence or some sentences). \nAs the graph shows, each line(s) colored by black, red, and \nblue at the subtext level corresponds to the lines described \nby the AI agent, the friend (P1), and the researcher (P2). \nThe key point here is that the content at the expressed level \nis common to all participants at every step.\nFrom left to right in Fig. 8, the drawn steps included con-\nstructing own worldview, adding a story line (by P1), updat-\ning to a higher structure by seeing the other ones’ writing \nresults, adding a story line by the AI agent, and updating to \na higher structure by seeing the other ones’ writing results. \nAs the timeline shows, the description of a participant and \nupdating by other participants occurred alternately. Here, \neach worldview in Step 1 was made from the initial prompt \nand own background. We omitted this step due to space limi-\ntations as well as the latter process of the story generation.\nImportantly, the levels above the expressed level varied \namong participants (including the AI agent), reflecting their \nindividual interpretations and worldviews. They became \nlatent contexts that underlay the expressed information. In \nFig. 8, the colors of the three large horizontal arrows cor -\nrespond to such latent context.\nThen, the latent context that the AI agent had could be \na trigger for an unpredictable discovery by human writers. \nThe letters “W0,” “W1,” and “W2” denote the worldviews \nof the AI agent, friend, and researcher, respectively. Here, \nW0 involved the generation of stories by a storyteller with \nhuman users and W1 and W2 involved the generation of the \nparticipants’ own stories with the AI storyteller to connect to \nspace-distant friends. It is reasonable to consider that the AI \nagent’s worldview (W0) was the composition of the expec-\ntation of the generation of stories at the expressed level. \nThe contents of the initial prompt human writers gave as \nthe story basis and the OpenAI’s vision implemented in the \nGPT-3 model, e.g., to realize artificial general intelligence \nthat benefits humanity as a whole, not to harm humanity, \nand to make it safe [OpenAI (2018)]. The worldviews W1 \nand W2 are those of human writers, which were the com-\npositions of the expectations of the stories at the expressed \nlevel, the contents of the initial prompt, and the images of \nthe world they live in because the explained case dealt with \ntelling the story of themselves.\nAs illustrated in Fig.  8, while interaction with the AI \nagent enabled human writers to update their cognition of \nthemselves as catharsis and the storylines changed at the \nsubtext level, their worldviews did not change. That is, \nthe theme, i.e., humans’ telling stories about themselves \nand SAGA’s acting as a storyteller, remained the same \nthroughout the process, although the storyline was updated \ncollaboratively.\n5  Discussion\nThe case studies concretely demonstrated that the three phe-\nnomena can be clearly expressed by applying HieNaR S3, \ni.e., expressing social values in various levels of granularity, \neffects of creative conflict, and collaboration based on vari-\nous worldviews.\n5.1  Expressing social values for social good\nAs demonstrated in Case 1, the HieNaR framework has \nproven valuable for explicitly assessing social values. \nTo begin, this case illustrated how Dfrome could con-\nnect technical elements to ethical considerations in AI \ndevelopment, thereby visualizing the path from technical \ndesign to the ethics level that corresponds to social values. \nA critical point to note was that Dfrome emphasized the \n3202 AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208\nFig. 8  Overview of the human-AI collaboration case of generating stories using SAGA (See also [Shakeri et al. (2021)])\n3203AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \nrepresentation of social values at the ethics level. Con-\nsequently, the hierarchy expressing social values aligned \nmore closely with Dfrome’s framework, which operated \nindependently of the HieNaR approach.\nHowever, although Dfrome provided a space to express \nsocial values, its use alone did not guarantee that ideas \nwill be described at the ethical level. Rather, the narrative \n(text) level in HeiNaR determined when the articulation of \nideas was considered complete, i.e., reaching the ethical \nlevel. The representation between the narrative level and \nthe expressed level elucidated the process of achieving \nethical articulation. Additionally, the underlying world-\nview that generated this narrative was also represented at \nthe worldview (set of texts) level. Consequently, HieNaR \nfunctioned as a clear framework for explaining why and \nhow ethical considerations were successfully incorporated. \nMoreover, this framework has made the foundational pre-\nsuppositions for handling social values visually operable.\nAs observed in Case 3, such visualization in HieNaR \nfacilitated the generation of new narratives through col-\nlaboration. These findings suggest that, by systemat-\nically assessing the potential for generating alternative \nsocial values, collaborative efforts centered on narratives \naddressing these values are likely to foster both the crea-\ntion and realization of social goods.\n5.2  Relationship between the three types \nof hierarchies\nThe three hierarchies could be understood as orthogonal \nto one another using the case’s concrete materials. Specifi-\ncally, the three axes provided the hierarchical representa-\ntion of the narrative (HieNaR), the hierarchical representa-\ntion of the artifacts, and the axis of the individual’s point \nof view.\nIn detail, as for the social values related to the relation-\nship between AI and society, the ethics level of Dfrome \ndirectly dealt with social values. Placing some ethical val-\nues from various options at the ethics level involved the \neffects of the choices in the personal view, such as profes-\nsion, belief, passion, etc.\nHowever, using Dfrome did not necessarily mean the \nethics level was dealt with as described above. To express \nthis at the ethics level, we confirmed an expectation to \nhandle the ethics level at the higher levels in HieNaR. Hie-\nNaR’s narrative and worldview levels directly described \nthe pattern of such an intention as obtained in Case 1.\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the expres-\nsion in HieNaR could be determined independently of the \nexpression in Dfrome, thus emphasizing that the three axes \nare orthogonal to each other.\n5.3  Existence of creative conflicts\nCases 2 and 3 showed that the conflicts in HieNaR levels \ncould potentially promote creative activity because the con-\nflict was not necessarily negative as it might lead to a new \nunderstanding. The HieNaR’s visualization of the conflict as \nthe relationship between the levels was helpful in systemati-\ncally addressing the situation. Then, the conflict reconcili-\nation process corresponded to a type of fusion of horizons \nin hermeneutics, as discussed in Sect.  1.4.3. Notably, the \nresults of representation, which correspond to the subjec-\ntive text in the general hermeneutic process, dynamically \nchanged in the data utilization process, especially in collabo-\nrative work. HieNaR allowed us to understand this dynamic \nprocess in a visual manner.\nTherefore, whether static or dynamic, HieNaR promotes \ncreativity by visualizing conflicts between levels, fostering \nnew insights in data utilization.\n5.4  Rooted in the participant’s own worldview \nwhen collaborating to use data\nIn a collaboration-style data utilization, the levels higher \nthan the expressed level corresponded to the latent con-\ntexts of participants (Fig. 8). Thus, we were able to directly \nexpress different interpretations one could have despite \nlooking at the same data. This enables us to adopt a more \nstructured approach by determining the appropriate level for \nintegrating options. This determination serves as a basis for \nselecting different storylines and contents to realize alter -\nnative narratives, while acknowledging potential risks and \nvulnerabilities associated with these actions.\nIn addition, the three cases showed that the data, algo-\nrithm, and tool described in Sect.  1.4.3 correspond to the \ntheoretical entities at the expressed level. Especially in \nthe collaborative case, the relationship between the theo-\nretical entities, a user’s own worldview, and the other users’ \nworldviews could be visually organized as shown in Fig. 8. \nAdditionally, using the three axes, we confirmed that the \nworldview can exist at the highest level in HieNaR. It is a \nrepresentation generated by the intersection of patterns at \nthe set of texts level that are expected to equilibrate to the \nartifact representation whose ideas are selected by the cor -\nresponding personal views.\nFurthermore, when a user used an AI agent (LLM) in \nCase 3, the AI agent already had its own worldview set \nby OpenAI. A specific worldview was added as the initial \nprompts as “being a storyteller and realizing other partici-\npants telling stories themselves.” Therefore, the operation in \nwhich the user input prompts to the AI agent and obtained \noutputs meant that the AI agent generated a narrative that \nwas consistent with not only the preceding storyline but also \nthe and condition between the storyline, the worldview set \n3204 AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208\nby OpenAI and the role of the storyteller set by the human \nparticipants via the initial prompts.\nTherefore, for AI agents, since the two components that \nconstitute the worldview (the one by the provider and the \none by the initial prompt) do not change during the data \nutilization process, the worldview seems maintained as long \nas the expectation for the storyline does not change from the \nworldview level.\n5.5  HieNaR and the hermeneutic circle\nThe process of deepening understanding through interac-\ntions among various levels in HieNaR aligns with the herme-\nneutic circle [Laverty (2003), Nakakoji (2006)]. Each level, \nfrom the word to the set of texts, is considered to possess \nits own social, cultural, and historical backgrounds. For \ninstance, words have their historical roots, while texts have \ntheir historical contexts. The overall meaning of elements at \neach level is formed within the complex relationships woven \nby these levels.\nThe dynamic aspect of the interaction between levels cor-\nresponds to the hermeneutic circle. Changes at one level \nhave the potential to update the backgrounds of other levels. \nThis was exemplified in Cases 2 and 3, where the content \nat the expressed level created a conflict in the relationship \nbetween levels. As shown in these cases, this conflict neces-\nsitated an update to the content of the narrative below the \ntext level.\nMoreover, each element at the subword level or below, \nnot covered in this study, is also considered to possess its \nown unique social, cultural, and historical backgrounds. \nConsidering these new backgrounds can open up possibili-\nties for novel interpretations, highlighting the importance of \nexploring these lower levels as well. The case for addressing \nsuch levels at and below the subword level will be discussed \nin a future study.\n5.6  Practical implications\n5.6.1  Improving the data utilization process\nThen, we consider the practical implications. Using Hie-\nNaR and applying the knowledge obtained in this paper, we \ncan more clearly operationalize the data utilization process. \nSpecifically, it is possible to visualize at what level conflicts \nneed to be resolved in the data utilization or to visualize \nmultiple contexts individually and design interrelationships \nbetween them. The results of a higher-quality analysis based \non such a narrative can lead to actions.\nMeanwhile, we can reasonably assume that many failed \ncases went unreported, particularly in academic papers. Hie-\nNaR can explain the cause of failure as an inappropriate \nrelationship between the levels. For example, when there \nis a conflict in HieNaR, the whole data or the algorithm \ncan be changed. Such a failure is probably caused by the \nwrong tool selection. The tool used in the analysis must be \nselected because its algorithm is beneficial to realizing the \nexpectation.\nAnother reason can be the lack of proper expectations \nat higher levels, as shown in the trial-and-error case in \nSect. 4.2. To solve this incorrect relationship, the trial-and-\nerror step for constructing a new understanding is crucial. \nKnowledge is useful in reconciling the conflict.\nThe application of these insights derived from analyz-\ning these potentially problematic cases can enhance the \ndata utilization process. By systematically identifying and \naddressing these failure modes, we can improve the ana-\nlytical workflow, thereby increasing the efficiency of data-\ndriven projects.\n5.6.2  Promoting further creative activity in the data \nutilization process\nWe can support creative activity by questioning what is \nundoubtedly set as the pre-supposition ([Wittgenstein et al. \n(1969)] pp. 44–44e, [Kobayashi and Funabiki (1995)] pp. \n17–26, [Sekiguchi and Hori (2021), Sekiguchi (2022)]). \nFirst, reconsidering from the highest level of HieNaR (i.e., \nworldview level) can lead to more creative data utilization. \nFor example, group work such as workshops can stimu-\nlate creativity through collaborative conflicts and diverse \nworldviews. In addition, acting as a facilitator as described \nin the introduced case in Sect.  4.3 can make latent contexts \nexplicit, enhancing this process.\nSecond, case studies revealed that tool specifications dic-\ntate the expressed level of data utilization, which remains \nconstant with the same tool. The HieNaR model allows users \nto visually identify and adjust their expressed level, encour-\naging the inclusion of higher-level insights that are often \nomitted during the result-saving phase, as shown in Case 2. \nMaking these higher levels explicit aids in enhancing later \nunderstanding.\nIn the context of Nakakoji’s categorization of creativ -\nity support tools [Nakakoji (2006)], Case 3 demonstrated a \nski-type creative process where AI facilitated novel collabo-\nrative narrative generation. Furthermore, HieNaR oper -\nationalized this concept by providing a structured frame -\nwork to visualize this innovative mechanism, allowing us to \nrefine human–AI collaborative creativity. Therefore, when \nwe implement an AI promoting HieNaR practice, such a \nHieNaR-based AI will support its user in the ski-type man-\nner, too.\nAdditionally, this application of the ski concept to both \nthe AI narrative facilitator and HieNaR’s analytical frame-\nwork showed how Nakakoji’s classification can be applied to \nLLM-based creativity support tools, enabling researchers to \n3205AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \nsystematically explore different patterns of human-AI inter-\naction in narrative generation.\n The importance of freely varying granularity was once \nargued by Jerry R. Hobbs [Hobbs (1985)] but remained \nunresolved. This study has redefined this issue from the \nperspective of narrative generation in data utilization. One \nof our future tasks is to apply LLMs to this free switching \nof granularity in our creativity support tool for providing \nHieNaR S3.\n5.6.3  Preserving people’s autonomy against LLMs\nHieNaR’s visualization enhances explicability and strategic \noperability, including in collaborations with powerful AI \nagents such as recent LLMs. While AI agents co-creatively \ninfluence content, we can consider that users can exercise \ntheir subjectivity by intentionally engaging in the fusion of \nhorizons [Laverty (2003), Gadamer (2004)] in a way that is \nopen to the future [Pierosara (2022)]. HieNaR facilitates this \nby providing a visually structured framework that enables \nusers to consciously integrate various worldviews among \nparticipants, including those of AI agents.\nAs demonstrated in Case 3, this fusion process becomes \nparticularly evident when conflicts between different levels \noccur. Through explicit representation, HieNaR empowers \nusers to adapt or maintain their own worldviews, which are \nvisualized at the top level of the HieNaR framework should \nincorporate contents that are open to the future. Users can \nthen accept, modify, or reject AI-generated content, such as \nchanges in storylines at the subtext level. These contents can \nbe positioned at various levels due to differences in granu-\nlarity, including the worldviews of AI agents. In this way, \nHieNaR offers insights into the strategic distribution of con-\ntributions at various levels among participants, leading to a \nbetter balance of autonomy between humans and AI agents.\nMoreover, HieNaR provides a temporal perspective that \naids in understanding the dynamics of human–AI interac-\ntion by tracing changes in users’ interpretation over time, \nthe necessity of which is argued by [Laverty (2003)]. This \napplies to both individual narrative generation processes and \nlong-term coexistence with AI in daily life. This awareness \nof evolving perspectives allows users to improve their inter-\nactions with AI systems over time.\nWe can replace AI agents when new ones offer superior \nperformance or when current agents’ worldviews misalign \nwith our own worldviews and lives. This is especially impor-\ntant because, as shown in Case 3, the worldviews implemented \nin AI agents do not necessarily change during each data uti-\nlization process. Therefore, we must adhere to the policy of \ndeveloping pluralistic AI agents, particularly LLMs that exert \nsignificant influence on people and society, to preserve human \nautonomy. It is crucial to have options for people to select \nAI agents whose embedded worldviews align with their own \nworldviews and lives.\nThese discussions introduce a new perspective on the \nmoral dimensions of narratives, particularly in response to \nthe challenges posed by recent LLMs. Implementing these \nsupport mechanisms represents a significant area for future \ninvestigation.\n5.7  HieNaR’s limitations and future work\nHieNaR is capable of addressing the logical consistency in \npart–whole relationships, including worldviews, as exempli-\nfied by its ability to presuppose and realize the expression of \nsocial values within narratives, as shown in Case 1. However, \nit cannot independently make value judgments, such as deter-\nmining what is good or bad. This point refers to the other \nprinciples introduced by [Floridi and Cowls (2019)] besides \nautonomy and explicability, i.e. beneficence, non-maleficence, \nand justice. To support the realization of social good, another \nsystem for value judgments is necessary, which remains a chal-\nlenge for future research.\nThe network structure dealt with in HieNaR is limited to the \ninternal structure of what is expressed. For example, HieNaR \ndoes not address factors such as the material on which the \nexpression is made (e.g., paper, cloth, digital). At the particle \nlevel, which is the smallest unit in HieNaR, interactions with \nthese materials would give rise to elements as substrokes, but \ncurrently, only one aspect—what is expressed—is addressed. \nIn fact, delving into the discussion of materials opens up fur-\nther possibilities for cultural discourse. For instance, in cal-\nligraphy, the choice of materials significantly influences the \nworldview. Addressing these relationships with the world \noutside of HieNaR remains a future challenge.\nFinally, there must be a gap between providing a framework \nand having it put into practice. To encourage more practical \nimplementation, it is effective to create tools equipped with \nthe vocabulary and grammar of the HieNaR framework. First, \nwe plan to realize a tool that can provide HieNaR S3 with \ninteractive user interfaces and algorithm options. Each algo-\nrithm tends to define a pattern, and we must change algorithms \ncorresponding to the expected pattern. Second, we plan to pro-\nmote co-creative data utilization using a new tool to express \nand reconsider the presupposition at higher levels because the \nunderstandings at these levels differ among participants and \nare useful to recognize different perspectives. Finally, using \nthis tool, we plan to aggregate various cases and conduct a \nquantitative analysis.\n3206 AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208\n6  Conclusions\nThis study proposed HieNaR, a hierarchical framework \nthat explains the narrative generation mechanism in the \ndata utilization process. HieNaR can straightforwardly \nexpress narrative structure by rearranging the knowledge \nof fields dealing with narratives in a hierarchical man-\nner. Here, it is generalized to deal with various numeri-\ncal and linguistic data utilization cases. The usefulness \nof the straightforward explanation of the narrative gen-\neration mechanism using HieNaR was demonstrated by \nperforming three case studies to investigate qualitative \ncharacteristics.\nA systematic understanding of the narrative generation \nmechanism in the data utilization process is significant \nbecause this understanding is necessary for promoting \nmeaningful analyses and generating actions. It is also \neffective for realizing further creative activities. Further -\nmore, it can lead to the development of better relationships \nbetween contemporary data-driven AI systems and humans \nby visualizing the collaborative hermeneutic process.\nAppendix\nOperational rules for consistent HieNaR use\nWe set six rules to make the HieNaR operation consist-\nent and useful. While the former ones are more essential \nin maintaining consistency, the latter ones are established \ndue to their operational usefulness. Since the linguistic case \nmakes the application of these rules clearer, we explain it \nbased on Fig. 9.\nNode of an un‑composed element\nExcept for the lowest level, all nodes are supposed to com-\nprise two or more elements. However, we must consider a \nnode with a single element to maintain consistency between \nlevels. For example, nodes with a dashed line in Fig.  9 cor-\nrespond to such nodes. Typical examples include the words \n“it,” “is,” “comfortable,” and “around” at the subsentence \nlevel. The manipulation allows us to construct the sentence \n“it is comfortable around between 20 °C and 25 °C.” by \ncombining six nodes at the subsentence level, that is, “it,” \nFig. 9  Example of the linguistic case of the hierarchical narrative representation (HieNaR)\n3207AI & SOCIETY (2025) 40:3187–3208 \n“is,” “comfortable,” “around,” “between 20°C and 25°C,” \nand “. (period).”\nNonnecessity of patterning\nIn the patterned state, not all nodes are necessarily patterned. \nFor example, the gray-painted nodes in the patterned state \nin Fig. 9 correspond to such nodes. Using this rule, nodes \nthat are not easily patterned are allowed to remain in their \nraw states.\nWord omission\nHieNaR can omit particular words in representation. For \nexample, actual analyses tend to omit stopwords that appear \ntoo often to analyze their meanings (e.g., “a,” “the,” “and,” \n“or,” “but,” “in,” “of,” etc.). The analyst abductively inter -\npolates and/or extrapolates these words to construct nodes \nat a higher level.\nLevel skip\nThe levels we cannot pay significant attention to can be \nskipped when describing HieNaR. For example, the sub-\nsentence level can be skipped if we think of sentences by \nseeing words.\nApproximate the descriptive state to the raw state\nWhen we deal with natural language data, some raw data can \nbe considered as a type of descriptive data. If we simplify \nand consider the raw natural language data to be the same as \ndescriptive data, we can omit one of them as shown in Fig. 9. \nPattern for state or action\nThe patterns described in Fig.  9 involve a noun or a noun \nphrase. However, they can be described in various ways, \nsuch as clauses, sentences, and texts based on the condition \nthat the lower-level pattern is a part, and the higher-level pat-\ntern is a whole. The only rule to maintain is that the concept \nat the higher level contains the concept at the lower level.\nAcknowledgements The University of Tokyo’s DFIL social collabo-\nration course, JST Grant Number JPMJPF2013 and Project Number \n236100000155 (ClimCORE), JPMXS0118067246 (Q-Leap), and the \nMEXT Initiative for Life Design Innovation provided support for this \nstudy.\nFunding Partial financial support was received from the Univer -\nsity of Tokyo’s DFIL social collaboration course, JST Grant Num-\nber JPMJPF2013 and Project Number 236100000155 (ClimCORE), \nJPMXS0118067246 (Q-Leap), and the MEXT Initiative for Life \nDesign Innovation.\nData availability The datasets analyzed during the current study are \navailable in the following repositories.
