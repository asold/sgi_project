Solar energy is an effective alternative source \nto the traditional energy sources. The photovoltaic distributed \ngeneration is an effective energy source  since it combines the \nadvantages of smart grid and solar energy. Depending on the \nseason, photovoltaic gene ration connected to the distribution \nnetwork shows different penetration that  affects the network \nload distribution, which can lead to excessive loading at lines, \ncables and  transformers in distribution systems.  As the life \nexpectancy of transformers and c ables in the distribution \nsystem depends on the operating conditions, overloading caused \nby penetration of distributed photovoltaic systems speeds up the \naging of the components. Therefor e, investigating the effects of \nphotovoltaic systems on the  aging is important for providing \ninsight on the efficient use of components in the distribution  \ntransformers. In this study, the impact of loss of life on the \ndistribution transformer photovoltaic  production is examined \nby taking the seasonal influences into account from the point of \nview of a consumer. \n \nIndex Terms —Distribution transformer, aging and \nphotovoltaic generation. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \nGlobally, there is an increases in load demand and an \nexhaustion of traditional energy sources. Environmental \nsensitivity, such as restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions \nhas led to an increase in energy production that uses \nrenewable energy sources [1 ]-[3]. One of the renewable \nenergy sources is the photovoltaic production, and the \ninterest in it has increased significantly in re cent years, in \nparallel with the development of photovoltaic technology. In \na report released in 2010, it was announced that solar energy \nproduction target of the Europe for 2020 is 84.4  GW.  When \nGermany has 20,7 GW solar power capacity in 2012, planned \nsolar power is 51.8GW in 2020 [4]. \nIncreasing the number of photovoltaic production units \nconnected to the network has led to a need for examining the \neffects of the distribution system [1 ]-[3]. Photovoltaic \nsystems can cause voltage fluctuations due to the changes on \nthe solar energy. It also causes power factor problems due to  \nactive power changes in the system. In addition, as the \nphotovoltaic systems were designed as  unidirectional, \nprotection plans are affected when the network operates in \n \n \n \n \nManuscript received June 2, 2015; revised January 23, 2016.  \nThe authors are with the Electrical Engineering Department, Technical \nUniversity of Istanbul, Turkey (e-mail: ozturkbanu@itu.edu.tr , \nbagriy@itu.edu.tr, komurgoz@itu.edu.tr). \n \nbidirectional power flow mode. Single -phase photovoltaic \nproduction due to unbalanced distribution system is a voltage \nimbalance between the phases [1], [5]. \nTransformers are important element in electrical power \ngrids, in terms of both reliability and costs. Although they are \nextremely energy efficient, heat dissipation is a limiting \nfactor for the maximum loading of transformers. The reliable \noperation of distribution systems is critically dependent on  \ndetailed understanding of load impacts on distribution \ntransformer insulation systems. When  transformers are \noperated in an overloaded mode, it speeds up aging and \ncauses an increase in the probability of major failures. \nIn this study, the effects of the rooftop photovoltaic \nproduction in summer and in winter seasons on the useful life \nof distribution transformer have been studied. Variation in \nloss of life of distribution  transformer was examined by \ntaking the seasonal influence of PV penetration into account. \nDaily load profiles are used to determine the transformer’s \nloss of life. \n \nII. REDUCTION IN THE USEFUL LIFE OF TRANSFORMERS \nThe dielectric insulating properties of the insulation \nmaterial may weaken if transformers are exposed to the \ntemperatures above the limiting values. The insulation ages \nmore rapidly, reducing its normal life. According to the IEEE \nC57.91-1995 guide, the life of the insulation is equal to the  \noverall life of a transformer [6] . The guide leads the \ncalculation of the winding hottest-spot temperature, which is \nthe driving factor for limiting temperature overloads. Ratings \nsuch as the loss  of life and the winding hottest -spot \ntemperature can be used by system operators during  \ncontingency conditions, which will allow them to overload \ntransformers for a definite time. \nThe most important parameters that influence the \ntransformer useful life is the hottest-spot temperature ( ѲH). \nThe relationship between the hottest spot temperature and the \ntransformer useful life is obtained by using the experimental \nresults and the Arrhenius reaction theory given in an IEEE \nstandard, which is shown below: \n \nPer unit life =\n273\n.exp\nH\nB\nQ\nA\n\n \n                     (1) \n \nwhere, QH is hot-spot temperature (° C), A and B are the \nconstants. While hot-spot temperature is below 110° C , \ntransformer life is calculated as 1pu [6 ]. As  a result of \nconducted experiments,  constant A and B in standards are \nfound as 9.8×10-18 and 15000 respectively. Fig.  1 shows the \nchange of the life with respect to hottest spot temperature. \nInfluence of PV Penetration on Distribution Transformer \nAging \nBanu Uçar, Mustafa Bağrıyanık, and Gü ven Kö mü rgö z \nJournal of Clean Energy Technologies, Vol. 5, No. 2, March 2017\n131doi: 10.18178/jocet.2017.5.2.357\n  \n \nFig. 1. Variation of the per unit life with the hottest spot temperature. \n \nAging acceleration factor is used to compare aging speed \nof transformer at 110° C. Relative aging rate of the \ntransformer insulation for given load and temperature values, \ncan be determined as follows; \n \n15000 15000\n383 273HQ\nAAFe\n  \n                          (2) \n \nAging acceleration factor is equal to 1 at 110° C. Aging rate \nis greater than 1 for higher temperatures and less than 1 for \nlower temperatures. The given graph in Fig. 2 shows  change \nof the aging acceleration factor with respect  to hottest spot \ntemperature. For calculation of the loss of life of transformer, \nhottest-spot temperatures must be defined. Hottest -spot \ntemperature could be calculated with high accuracy by using \nthe results of the experimental methods. \n \n \nFig. 2. Variation of aging acceleration factor with the hottest-spot \ntemperature. \n \nHottest-spot temperature could be predicted by using \nthermal models from standards with top layer’s temperature, \nload status and ambient temperature. If top layer’s \ntemperature is not available, hotte st-spot temperature could \nbe predicted with top -layer temperature, load status and \nambient temperature.  \nIEEE C57.91-1995 standard is modeling change of \ntemperature with respect to the change of load. Calculation of \ntop-oil temperature, which is created by change of loads, and \nhottest-spot temperature is simplified. Changes of \ntemperature could cause change of oil viscosity. To take \naccount of load loss and change of oil viscosity, m and n \nconstant are included to equations. Depending on the type of \ncooling, value is between 0 and 1.  \nHottest-spot temperature (Ѳ H) is the sum of ambient \ntemperature (ѲA), top layer oil temperature change compared \nto the ambient temperature (ΔѲTO) and winding temperature \nchange compared to the oil temperature (ΔѲH). \n \nѲH = ѲA + ∆ѲTO + ∆ѲH                            (3) \n \nѲTO= ѲA +∆ѲTO                                 (4) \n \nChange of top oil temperature depending on change of \nloads can be obtained as given in Eq. 5. \n \n∆ѲTO = (∆ѲTO, u - ∆ѲTO, i)(1-\nexp TO\nt\n\n) + ∆ѲTO, i        (5) \n \n∆ѲTO, i = ∆ѲTO, R\n( 1)\n( 1)\nn\niKR\nR\n \n                     (6) \n \n∆ѲTO, u = ∆ѲTO, R\n( 1)\n( 1)\nn\nuKR\nR\n \n                    (7) \n \nThe increase in the hottest -spot temperature depends on \nload and time and can be defined as follows; \n \n∆ѲH = (∆ѲH, u - ∆ѲH, i)(1-\nexp W\nt\n\n) + ∆ѲH, i           (8) \n \nFirst and last value of the change of top oil temperature: \n \n∆ѲTO, i = ∆ѲTO, R\n( 1)\n( 1)\nn\niKR\nR\n \n \n                   (9) \n \n∆ѲTO, u = ∆ѲTO, R\n( 1)\n( 1)\nn\nuKR\nR\n \n                   (10) \n \nIII.

CASE STUDY \nTo study the aging effects of the photovoltaic systems on \nthe distribution transformer , the loss of life is examined by \ntaking into account the effects of seasonal changes by using a \nsample grid. In this stud y, the data from the photovoltaic \npanels in Istanbul Technical University in year 2009 are used. \nTaking these data into account, a system of 1000 consumers \nwith 5m 2 500W roof type panels, supplied through a \ndistribution transformer is designed [7]. \nThe change of the load profile and the power consumption \nfrom the transformer in July and January nin a span of 24 \nhours and the PV production are given in Fig.  4 and Fig.  5. \nWhile the PV production in the summer supplies a \nconsiderable portion of the demand, in January this ratio is \nvery low. The power consumption is normalized according to \na 2MV A transformer’s power. The effect of photovoltaic \nparticipation of transformer life in July 2009 to investigate \nthe air temperature were  obtained from the Meteorological \nService. \n \n \nFig. 4.

CONCLUSION \nPower transformers are an important element and the \nphotovoltaic generation is one of the useful source choices in \nelectrical power grids. Common sense and good planning is \nrequired to keep the economic gains in balance with the risks \nof failure in grid systems. The reliable operation of \ndistribution transformers is critically dependent on detailed \nunderstanding of load impacts on distribution transformer \ninsulation systems. In this study, the effects of the rooftop \nphotovoltaic production on distribution transformer useful \nlife have been studied taking the seasonal influences into \naccount. It has been  shown that PV is an important effect in \ngrid system and it can significantly extend the transformer \nlife. The use of a solar PV power system will be even more \nbeneficial. Under load demand, production of distributed \ngeneration systems based upon renewable energy sources has \na positive effect on the ageing of transformer aging. However, \nover the load demand  local production causes reverse \ndirection power flow These have a negative effect on \ntransformer aging that must be investigated. \nREFERENCES \n[1] T.
