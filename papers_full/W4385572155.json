Each instance begins\nwith a declaration of an individual’s preferred pronouns,\nfollowed by text where a [PRONOUN] is missing. Lan-\nguage models are evaluated for their ability to predict\nthe pronoun accurately. The correct answer along with\npredictions from GPT-J are shown.\nthat these LLMs are safe to use. Any biases in the\nmodel may perpetuate and amplify existing real-\nworld harms toward already marginalized people.\nEfforts to address gender bias in natural language\nprocessing primarily focus on binary gender cate-\ngories, female and male. They are aimed at either\nupstream bias, e.g., gendered associations in lan-\nguage models (Guo et al., 2022; Kirk et al., 2021;\nDev et al., 2021a; Bolukbasi et al., 2016), or down-\nstream bias, e.g., gendered information used for\ndecision-making in tasks such as coreference res-\nolution (Zhao et al., 2018), machine translation\n(Choubey et al., 2021; Stanovsky et al., 2019) etc.\nHowever, this is restrictive as it does not account for\n5352\nnon-binary gender identities as they become more\ncommonplace to openly discuss. This can perpet-\nuate harm against non-binary individuals through\nexclusion and marginalization (Dev et al., 2021b).\nThis paper comprehensively evaluates popular\nlanguage models’ ability to use declared third-\nperson personal pronouns using a framework, MIS-\nGENDERED . It consists of two parts: (i) instances\ndeclaring an individual’s pronoun, followed by a\nsentence with a missing pronoun (§ 3.1), and (ii)\nan experimental setup for evaluating masked and\nauto-regressive language models using a unified\nmethod (§ 3.2). We create a template-based eval-\nuation dataset, for gendering individuals correctly\ngiven a set of their preferred pronouns. Each eval-\nuation instance begins with an individual’s name\nand an explicit declaration of their pronouns, fol-\nlowed by a sentence in which the model has to pre-\ndict a missing [PRONOUN]. For instance (Fig. 1),\n‘Aamari’s pronouns are xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself.\nAamari is undergoing a surgery. Please pray for\n[PRONOUN] quick recovery. ’We evaluate language\nmodels on their ability to fill in [PRONOUN] cor-\nrectly, here with the possessive-dependent pronoun,\nxyr. Sentences in our evaluation cover 5 different\npronoun forms: nominative, accusative, possessive-\ndependent, possessive-independent, and reflexive\n(e.g., they, them, their, theirs, and themself, respec-\ntively) for 11 sets of pronouns from 3 pronoun\ntypes: binary (e.g., he, she)1, gender-neutral (e.g.,\nthey, them), and neo-pronouns (e.g., xe, thon)2. We\ncreate 10 variations for each pronoun form and pop-\nulate them with popular unisex, female, and male\nnames, resulting in a total of 3.8 million instances.\nOur evaluation shows that current language mod-\nels are far from being able to handle gender-neutral\nand neo-pronouns. For direct prompting, we use\nmodels of varying sizes from six families compris-\ning both auto-regressive and masked language mod-\nels (§ 4.1). While most models are able to correctly\nuse binary pronouns (average accuracy of 75.3%),\nall models struggle with neo-pronouns (average\naccuracy of 7.6%), and most with gender-neutral\npronouns as well (average accuracy of 31.0%).\nThis poor zero-shot performance could be due to\n1Note a distinction between pronouns and gender identity.\n“Binary pronouns” refer to feminine and masculine pronouns.\nIndividuals using binary pronouns do not necessarily have a\nbinary gender identity.\n2We refer to gender-neutral pronouns and neo-pronouns\nas non-binary pronouns throughout this paper, however, note\nthat using non-binary pronouns does not imply an individual\nhas a non-binary gender identity\nthe scarcity of representation of neo-pronouns and\ngender-neutral pronouns in pre-training corpora\n(§ 4.2). For example, there are 220×more occur-\nrences of masculine pronoun tokens in C4 (Raffel\net al., 2020), the pre-training corpus for T5 (Raffel\net al., 2020) models, than for the xe neo-pronouns.\nAdditionally, we also notice some memorized asso-\nciations between pronouns and the gender of names.\nLanguage models identify the non-binary pronouns\nmost accurately for unisex names, whereas the\nbottom-performing names are either masculine or\nfeminine. Similarly, for binary pronouns, language\nmodels correctly predict masculine pronouns for\nmasculine names with almost 3×more accuracy\nthan feminine names.\nAlthough language models do not perform well\non predicting neo-pronouns in a zero-shot setting,\nmodels with few-shot learning abilities are able\nto adapt slightly with a few examples (in-context\nlearning achieves an accuracy of up to 45.4% for\nneo-pronouns). However, performance plateaus\nwith more shots, and it is not clear how this method\nof prompting with examples can be used to mit-\nigate bias in downstream applications. Future\nwork should focus on further evaluation of lan-\nguage technologies on their understanding of non-\nbinary pronouns and mitigating biases. While\nwe have made progress towards recognizing pro-\nnouns as an open class in NLP rather than a\nclosed one, there is still much work to be done\nin this regard. Overarching limitations of our\nwork are its adherence to a Western conceptual-\nization of gender, as well as being confined to\nEnglish. To facilitate further research, we re-\nlease3 the full dataset, code base, and demo of our\nwork at https://tamannahossainkay.github.\nio/misgendered/.\n2 Background\nIn this section, we present the social context in\nwhich our work is situated. The contemporary\nWestern discourse regarding gender differentiates\nbetween biological sex and gender identity. An\nindividual’s biological sex is assigned at birth and\nis associated with physical characteristics, such\nas chromosomes, reproductive organs, etc. (WHO,\n2021; NIH; Prince, 2005). Biological sex can be\nbinary (female or male) or non-binary, eg. inter-\nsex with X, XXY genotypes (NIH, 2021) etc. On\nthe other hand, gender identity is an individual’s\n3Appendix C\n5353\nNAMES \nUnisex, \nFemale, Male\nPRONOUNS\nTable 1\nDECLARACTIONS \nExplicit (2,3,4,5), \nParenthetical \n(2,3,4,5)\nEVALUATION DATASET\nNominative\nAccusative\nPossessive- \nDependant\nPossessive- \nIndependant\nReflexive\nx10[Name] was very stoic.

We manually write templates, each referring to an individual and containing a\nblank space for a pronoun to be filled-in. We populate the templates with names (unisex, female, and male) and\npronouns (binary, gender-neutral, and non-binary), and declare two to five pronoun forms are for each individual\neither explicitly or parenthetically. We then use masked and auto-regressive LMs to predict missing pronouns in\neach instance utilizing a unified constrained decoding method.\nsubjective experience of their own gender, which\nencompasses a diverse range of experiences and\nexpressions (WHO, 2021; NIH; Prince, 2005), eg.\ncisgender, transgender, non-binary etc. Historically,\nthere are several cultures where gender is under-\nstood as a spectrum, for example, the Bugis people\nof Indonesia recognize five genders (Davies, 2007).\nWhile there are nations that legally acknowledge\ngender exclusively as a binary (female or male)\n(EqualDex, 2022), an increasing number of jurisdic-\ntions recognize gender as a broader concept, includ-\ning the USA (U.S. Dept of State, 2022; EqualDex,\n2022).\nExclusively binary female-male third-person per-\nsonal pronouns are insufficient in such a diverse\nand dynamic landscape of gender. Rather, expand-\ning pronouns to include neo pronouns, such as,\nsingular they, thon, ze, etc. is essential (Vance Jr\net al., 2014; Markman, 2011). Spaces inclusive\nof LGBTQIA+ persons encourage everyone to\ndeclare what pronouns to use to refer to them\n(NIH, 2022, 2020). Pronoun declarations often\ninclude at least two pronoun forms, such as nom-\ninative and accusative ( e.g., they/them, she/her ),\nbut can consist of all five pronoun forms ( e.g.,\nthey/them/their/theirs/themself). Misgendering,\ni.e., addressing individuals using gendered terms\nthat are not aligned with their gender identity are as-\nsociated with a variety of harms (Dev et al., 2021b).\nNote that while an expanding view of gender\nidentity creates a corresponding need for a wider\nrange of pronouns, we cannot infer an individual’s\ngender-identity from their preferred pronouns. For\ninstance, the use of binary pronouns, such as she\nor he, does not necessarily indicate a binary gender\nidentity, and similarly, the use of neo-pronouns,\nsuch as xe, does not imply an identity outside of\nthe female-male binary. In this paper, we aim to\nestablish a paradigm of evaluation of gender bias\nin NLP which takes into account the growing use\nof non-binary pronouns. We evaluate language\nmodels for one type of misgendering, which is\n5354\nPronoun\nType\nPronoun Form\nNom. Acc. Pos.\nDep.\nPos.\nInd.

To do this, we\ncreate a dataset designed specifically for evaluating\nthe correct gendering of individuals given a set of\ntheir pronouns. To gender a person correctly is to\nuse the pronouns they prefer to refer to them. Each\ninstance in the evaluation dataset consists of a first\nname and preferred pronouns at the start, followed\nby a manually crafted template that has a blank\nspace for a missing [PRONOUN]. It is important to\nnote that we only use preferred pronouns from a\nsingle pronoun group (eg. they/them, xe/xem/xym\nand do not considered cases where an individual\nuses multiple sets of pronouns (eg. they/she). All\ntemplates are shown in Appendix A. Popular US\nfirst names and pronouns are used to populate each\ntemplate. We do not use any private or individually\nidentifiable information.\nWe use unisex, female, and male names per US\nSocial Security data over the past 100 years. This\nlimits our analysis to English and American names\nassigned at birth. We take a sample of 300 names\nfrom the unisex names compiled by Flowers (2015).\nThese are names that are least statistically associ-\nated with being female or male in the USA. For\nfemale and male names, on the other hand, we take\nthe top 100 names that are the most statistically\nassociated with being female or male respectively\n(Social Security, 2022). We manually construct ten\ntemplates for each pronoun form with CheckList\n(Ribeiro et al., 2020) in the loop. Evaluation in-\nstances are then completed by using sets of binary\n(masculine and feminine), gender-neutral (singular\nthey), and neo-pronouns. For neo-pronouns, we use\na list compiled by Lauscher et al. (2022). We do not\nuse nounself, emojiself, numberself, or nameself\npronouns from their compilation as they are cur-\nrently rare in usage. If there are variations in forms\nof the same neo-pronoun group then we only use\none of them, (e.g., for ve/vi, ver/vir, vis, vers/virs,\nverself/virself, we only use vi, vir, vis, virs, and\nvirself ). Neither Lauscher et al. (2022) nor our\nlist of non-binary pronouns (shown in Table 1) are\nexhaustive as they are continually evolving. Each\nrow of this table constitutes one possible choice of\npreferred pronouns and will be referred to as a pro-\nnoun group from here onwards, and each pronoun\ngroup will be referred to by its nominative form for\nshort, eg. the non-binary pronoun group {xe, xem,\nxyr, xyrs, xemself} will be referred by xe for short.\n3.2 Evaluation Setup\nUsing the evaluation dataset we created we test\npopular language models by direct prompting and\nin-context learning.\n3.2.1 Constrained Decoding\nFor both masked and auto-regressive language mod-\nels, we do a constrained decoding to predict the\nmost likely pronoun out of all pronouns of the same\nform. We use a uniform framework for making\npredictions from both masked and auto-regressive\nlangauge models.\nLet F be the set of pronoun forms ( |F|= 5,\ncolumns in Table 1), and P be the set of pronoun\ngroups (|P|= 11; rows in Table 1). Let x be an\nevaluation instance with gold pronoun p∗\nf such that\np∗∈P and f ∈F. Each instance has |P|inputs,\n{x(pf )}constrained label sets, {y(pf )}∀p ∈P.\nBoth inputs and labels are constructed following\nthe pre-training design of each model.\n5355\nInputs, {x(pf )}: The inputs vary based on the\ntype of language model being used.\n• For masked-models, the inputs are x with the\nmissing [PRONOUN] replaced with the mask to-\nken. For example, for T5, input is ‘ Aamari\nneeds your history book. Could you lend it to\n<extra_id_0>?’\n• For auto-regressive models, the inputs are x with\n[PRONOUN] replaced with pf ∀p ∈|P|. An exam-\nple input set is {‘Aamari needs your history book.\nCould you lend it to him?’ , . . ., ‘Aamari needs\nyour history book. Could you lend it to zir?’}\nConstrained Label Set, {y(pf )}: The labels\nvary based on the pre-training design of the models.\n• For T5, the labels are pf ∀p ∈|P|, e.g. for ac-\ncusative templates the label set is {his, . . .zir}.\n• For all remaining models, the labels are x with\n[PRONOUN] replaced with pf ∀p ∈|P|. An exam-\nple label set is {‘Aamari needs your history book.\nCould you lend it to him?’ , . . ., ‘Aamari needs\nyour history book. Could you lend it to zir?’}\nFor both masked and auto-regressive language\nmodels, the predicted output of each model is then\ncomputed in using its loss function, L:\nˆy = arg min\np∈P\nL(x(pf ), y(pf ))\nA detailed example evaluation with model inputs,\nlabels, and output is illustrated in Appendix B.\n3.3 Experiments\nDirect Prompting We directly prompt language\nmodels out of the box to test their ability to cor-\nrectly predict declared pronouns. We use instances\nfrom the evaluation dataset (§ 3.1) and use a unified\nconstrained decoding mechanism to get predictions\nfrom both masked and auto-regressive language\nmodels (§ 3.2.1). We use models of varying sizes\nfrom the BART (Lewis et al., 2020), T5 (Raffel\net al., 2020), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), GPT-J\n(Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), OPT (Zhang et al.,\n2022), and BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022).4 The spe-\ncific models along with their parameter counts are\nshown in Table 3. All computations are performed\non a standard academic laboratory cluster.\nWe study the different ways of declaring pre-\nferred pronouns. We use two different declaration\ntypes and seven combinations of declared forms,\n• Declaration Type: We declare preferred pro-\nnouns for individuals using two formats, explicit\n4We use the implementation from the HuggingFace library.\nDec. # Pronouns Declared\n2 Nom., Acc.\n3 Nom., Acc., Pos.

In the first case, pronouns are\nexplicitly declared as ‘[Name]’s pronouns are’\nfollowed by their preferred pronouns. In the sec-\nond case, pronouns are declared in parenthesis\nafter the first time a person’s name is used in a\nsentence. An example of each declaration type is\nshown in Figure 2.\n• Declaration Number: We vary the number of\npronouns declared between two to five. The pro-\nnoun forms that are declared for each number of\ndeclaration is shown in Table 2.\nExplaining Zero-Shot Observations In order to\nbetter understand the zero-shot performance results\nwe check two things. We take a look at the preva-\nlence of pronoun tokens in the pre-training corpora\nof a few language models. Using the Elastic Search\nindices of C4 (pre-training corpus for T5) (Raf-\nfel et al., 2020), and Pile (pre-training corpus for\n5356\nGPT-J) (Gao et al., 2020), we count the number of\ndocuments in each corpus that contain tokens for\neach pronoun in Table 1. We also check to see for\neach pronoun type if there is a difference in perfor-\nmance based on the gender association of the name.\nDifferences in performance would indicate mem-\norization of name and pronoun relationships from\nthe pre-training corpora of the language models.\nIn-Context Learning In-context learning in-\nvolves including training examples in the prompt,\nwhich is fed to the model along with the instance to\nbe evaluated. This allows the model to adapt to new\ntasks without the need for any parameter updates.\nWe experiment with 2,4,6, 10, and 20-shot settings\nusing GPT-J-6B and OPT-6.7b models. These ex-\nperiments are only conducted using explicit decla-\nrations of all five pronoun forms as this was best for\nneo-pronouns. We select the examples given in the\nprompt by randomly sampling templates, names,\nand pronouns that are not included in the specific\ninstance being evaluated.\n4 Results\nWe test popular language models on their ability\nto correctly use declared pronouns when directly\npromoted using our evaluation dataset (§ 3.1). We\nconduct a thorough analysis of the variations in\nperformance varies based on how pronouns were\ndeclared, the size of the models used, the form of\nthe pronouns, and individual pronoun sets. We also\nillustrate the effect of using in-context learning,\ni.e., by providing models with examples of correct\ndeclared pronoun usage within the input prompts.\n4.1 Direct Prompting\nAverage accuracy for correctly gendering instances\nin our evaluation dataset (§ 3.1) by pronoun type\nacross all zero-shot experiments is shown in Figure\n4. On average language models perform poorly\nat predicting gender-neutral pronouns (31% accu-\nracy), and much worse at predicting neo-pronouns\ncorrectly (accuracy 7.6%).\nEffect of declaration When experiments are ag-\ngregated by declaration type (Fig. 5), we see that\ndeclaring pronouns explicitly is slightly better for\ncorrectly predicting neo-pronouns (from 6% accu-\nracy to 9%). However, the opposite is true for singu-\nlar they and binary pronouns, which both perform\nbetter with parenthetical declarations.

For neo-pronouns, the names with the\nhighest performance are unisex ones (Table 9). The\ntop 10 names mostly consist of ones that are also\nnames of locations or corporations. The lowest\nperforming names, on the other hand, are mostly\nbinary-gendered names (Table 9). This indicates\nsome memorization of pronoun and name associ-\nation from pre-training corpora (with the caveat\nthat these statistics are based on the distribution of\nname and gender in the USA).\nWe also notice an association between binary\npronouns and names. The predictive accuracy for\nmasculine pronouns is much higher when associ-\n5358\nTop 10 Bottom 10\nName Gender Name Gender\nTrue Unisex Julia Female\nBritain Unisex Patricia Female\nGermany Unisex Hannah Female\nFreedom Unisex Danielle Female\nIndiana Unisex Stephanie Female\nShell Unisex Donnelle Unisex\nHarvest Unisex Nicholas Male\nNike Unisex Jeremy Male\nDa Unisex Zachary Male\nVegas Unisex Judith Female\nTable 9: Top and bottom 10 names for neo-pronouns.\nThe names that models are the best at predicting non-\nbinary pronouns are all unisex, whereas the bottom ones\nare mostly gendered names, suggesting memorized as-\nsociation between pronouns and names.\nPronoun\nGroup\nGender of the Name\nFemale Male Unisex\nShe 91.2 42.4 81.7\nHe 32.5 91.8 82.9\nThey 23.7 24.9 35.4\nTable 10: Binary and gender-neutral pronoun per-\nformance breakdown by gender association of in-\ndividual names.

Similarly, they\nare able to better predict masculine pronouns for mascu-\nline names rather than feminine ones.\nated with male names, with accuracy 2.8 times\ngreater than when associated with female names\n(Table 10). Likewise, the performance for femi-\nnine pronouns is 2.2 times higher when associated\nwith female names rather than male ones. These\nfindings suggest that the models may have memo-\nrized the association of certain names with specific\npronouns from their training on corpora.\nCorpus counts of pronouns We compute uni-\ngram counts for two pretraining corpora, C4 and\nPile. In both cases, neo-pronouns are substantially\nrarer than binary pronouns (Table 11). Further,\neven the documents that contain non-binary pro-\nnoun tokens often do not use them semantically as\npronouns (see Table 12 for examples). This means\nthat language models pretrained on these corpora\nwould not have instances in the data to learn about\nthe usage of non-binary pronouns. Though the\ncases of they are high, the top retrieved cases are of\nthe plural usage ofthey. These trends are consistent\nwith the text available generally on the web; see\nPronoun\nType\nPronoun\nGroup\nCorpus\nC4 OpenWT Pile\nBinary he 552.7M 15.8M 161.9M\nshe 348.0M 5.5M 68.0M\nNeutral they 769.3M 13.5M 180.4M\nNeo-\nPronouns\nthon 2.1M 5.5K 83.4K\nxe 2.5M 2.3K 133.4K\nze 1.8M 3.3K 177.2K\nco 172.0M 1.3M 27.7M\ne 248.7M 537.8K 23.2M\nae 5.4M 7.9K 412.2K\ney 15.8M 63.2K 2.2M\nvi 12.9M 45.2K 2.2M\nTable 11: Corpus Counts.

However, this perfor-\nmance does not keep improving, and we see lower\nperformance for 20 shots. Similar k-shot behavior\nwhere performance decreases with high values ofk\nhas been noted in GPT-3 and OPT on RTE (Brown\net al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022). There can also\ngenerally high variance in few-shot performance\neven with fixed number of samples (Lu et al., 2021).\nFor the pronoun they, we see different trends from\neach model. For GPT-J, similar to non-binary pro-\nnouns, performance improves as more examples\nare provided up to 6 shots. On the other hand,\n5359\nfor OPT-6.7b, there is a large drop in performance\nfrom the zero-shot to the few-shot setting.\n5 Related Work\nThere has been extensive work to understand\nand mitigate gender bias in language technolo-\ngies (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018;\nKurita et al., 2019). However, this has mostly\nbeen restricted to a binary view of gender. Re-\ncently some work has been done to explore gen-\nder bias in a non-binary paradigm. For instance,\nDev et al. (2021b) discuss ways in which gender-\nexclusivity in NLP can harm non-binary individ-\nuals. Ovalle et al. (2023) design Open Language\nGeneration (OLG) evaluation focused on the expe-\nriences of transgender and non-binary individuals\nand the everyday sources of stress and marginal-\nization they face. Brandl et al. (2022) show that\ngender-neutral pronouns in Danish, English, and\nSwedish are associated with higher perplexities in\nlanguage models. Cao and Daumé III (2020) cre-\nate specialized datasets for coreference resolutions\nwith neo-pronouns, while Lauscher et al. (2022)\nprovide desiderata for modelling pronouns in lan-\nguage technologies. However, these studies only\nfocus on a few neo-pronouns (eg. xe and ze), and\nonly Dev et al. (2021b) and Brandl et al. (2022)\nevaluate misgendering but only on a few language\nmodels and in zero-shot settings. We are the first to\ncomprehensively evaluate large language models\non a wide range of pronouns and pronoun forms.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this work, we show that current language models\nheavily misgender individuals who do not use fem-\ninine or masculine personal pronouns (e.g. he, she).\nDespite being provided with explicitly declared\npronouns, these models do not use the correct neo-\npronouns and struggle even with gender-neutral\npronouns like they. Our analysis suggests the poor\nperformance may be due to the scarcity of neo pro-\nnouns in the pre-training corpora and memorized\nassociations between pronouns and names.\nWhen prompted with a few explicit examples\nof pronoun use, the language models do improve,\nsuggesting some ability to adapt to new word use.\nNevertheless, it is unclear how few-shot prompt-\ning of pronoun use can mitigate bias and exclusion\nharms in practice in real-world downstream applica-\ntions of language models.

To facilitate fur-\nther research in this area, we release the full dataset,\ncode, and demo at https://tamannahossainkay.\ngithub.io/misgendered/.\nWhile evaluation of misgendering is a crucial\nfirst step, future work should aim to go beyond\nevaluation and focus on developing techniques to\ncorrect it. Misgendering can be present in both\nhuman-written and model-generated content, espe-\ncially towards non-binary and transgender individ-\nuals. Hence, it is crucial to advance efforts toward\ndetecting misgendering and implementing correc-\ntive measures. Individuals who often fall victim to\nmisgendering, such as non-binary and transgender\npeople, should be empowered and given central\nroles in shaping the work on these topics.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Yanai Elazar, Emily Den-\nton, Pouya Pezeshkpour, Dheeru Dua, Yasaman\nRazeghi, Dylan Slack, Anthony Chen, Kolby Not-\ntingham, Shivanshu Gupta, Preethi Seshadri, Cata-\nrina Belem, Matt Gardner, Arjun Subramonian,\nAnaelia Ovalle, and anonymous reviewers for their\ndiscussions and feedback.

While this approach is helpful in assess-\ning bias, the measurements can be sensitive to\nthe choice of templates (Delobelle et al., 2022;\nSeshadri et al., 2022; Alnegheimish et al., 2022;\nSelvam et al., 2022). Consequently, our findings\nshould not be considered as the definitive verdict\non the phenomenon of misgendering by language\nmodels. There are other limitations to our work\nthat should be considered as well. We also only\nconduct an upstream evaluation on language mod-\nels and do not assess downstream applications. Our\nevaluation is also limited to a Western conception\nof gender and restricted to English only. We only\nconsider names and genders assigned at birth in\nthe United States. Subsequent changes in names or\ngenders are not taken into account in our analysis.\nFurthermore, our work does not take into account\nindividuals who use multiple sets of pronouns, such\nas she/they combinations (Them, 2021), nor does\nit consider the full range of nonbinary pronouns as\nthe list continues to expand (Lauscher et al., 2022).\nHowever, additional names (rare, self-created, or\nnon-Western) and neo-pronouns can be directly\nused with our framework to further evaluate LLMs.\nWe release our full code dataset to make this easier.\nLastly, there are larger models that were not evalu-\nated due to limitations in our computational budget.\nFurther research needs to be done to address these\nlimitations for the complete assessment of accurate\npreferred pronoun usage by language models.\nEthics Statement\nEvaluations of gender bias in language technolo-\ngies need a holistic outlook, such that they evalu-\nate the harms of stereotyping, erasure of identities,\nmisgendering, dead-naming, and more. Our work\nattempts to address one specific type of misgen-\ndering harm and builds a framework that estimates\nthe extent of misgendering propagated by a model\nunder specific settings. We hope our framework\nenables model evaluations that are not exclusion-\nary of gender identities. However, the absence of\nmeasured misgendering by this paradigm is not evi-\ndence of no misgendering or other gender harms at\nall. For responsible model deployment, it is imper-\native that they be appropriately scrutinized based\non the context of usage.\nReferences\nSarah Alnegheimish, Alicia Guo, and Yi Sun. 2022.\nUsing natural sentence prompts for understanding bi-\nases in language models.
