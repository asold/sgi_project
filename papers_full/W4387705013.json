In the early 1970s, the attempt \nto introduce simple calculators into higher education led to a debate about their \nvalue and appropriateness, while their use would inevitably change the context \nof the mathematics classroom. Etlinger’s observation in 1974 highlighted the dual \npotential of technology, encompassing functional utility in generating responses \nand pedagogical significance in augmenting the learning process [1]. Subsequently, \ntechnology introduced a plethora of mathematical tools to educators, including soft-\nware specifically designed for calculations, graphing, and precise diagrammatic \nNikolaos Matzakos1(), \nSpyridon Doukakis2, \nMaria Moundridou1\n1School of Pedagogical and \nTechnological Education, \nAthens, Greece\n2Ionian University, Corfu, \nGreece\nnikmatz@aspete.gr\nhttps://doi.org/10.3991/ijet.v18i20.42979\n 52 International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) iJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023)\nMatzakos et al.\nrepresentation. These tools hold promising prospects for facilitating advantageous \nshifts in teaching and learning methodologies, leading to the transformation of the \nteacher’s role and the redefinition of the tasks given to the students.\nIn the following decades, research on the one hand and advancements in soft -\nware development on the other brought to the fore new digital technologies that \ncould be integrated into the mathematics classroom. These technologies include com-\nputer algebra systems (CASs), dynamic geometry software, and statistical packages. \nThis development has sparked rich discussions about the roles of these tools and \ntheir optimal utilization in educational settings. Noteworthy is the work of Pierce \nand Stacey in [2], who identified the opportunities that arise from the integration of \nmathematical software into the educational process. However, even in the present \nera, research such as [3] highlights that the utilization of mathematical software in \nhigher education remains limited, primarily due to the absence of a comprehensive \nframework associated with the integration of technology in mathematics education.\nWhile the development of a precise framework for integrating such technologies \ninto mathematics education is still ongoing, the emergence of artificial intelligence \nsystems, particularly large language models (LLMs), brings forth yet another digital \ntechnology to be considered. The recent widespread adoption of LLMs, exemplified by \nmodels such as ChatGPT, and their unrestricted usage have already initiated numer-\nous discussions and debates regarding the positive and negative perspectives [4]. \nThus, the following question arises: Since open access to these models cannot limit or \nprohibit their use, how can they be effectively incorporated into the realm of math-\nematical education to enhance teaching and learning? Therefore, there is a need to \nidentify the teaching and learning opportunities offered by LLMs and explore their \ninfluence on the curriculum and classroom dynamics, particularly in higher educa-\ntion settings for science and engineering studies. Mapping the opportunities offered \nby the use of LLMs can be a starting point for further research exploring the effective-\nness and impact of the integration of LLMs on students’ learning outcomes. In addi-\ntion, there is a prospect of highlighting specific areas where educational technology \ncan capitalize on the rich possibilities offered by LLMs, including tailored learning \nexperiences, real-time feedback, and the enhancement of digital skills.\nThe next section of this paper provides a concise overview of CASs and other math-\nematical problem-solving tools that are currently utilized as teaching and learning aids \nin the mathematics classroom. This is followed by an exploration of the emerging arti-\nficial intelligence tools that hold promise in the same context. Subsequently, in order to \ncompare LLMs to these other tools and illustrate their capabilities and limitations, four \npractical problem-solving cases from calculus, linear algebra, and numerical analysis—\naddressed with all three different tools—are presented. It is then attempted to map the \nnew opportunities arising from the integration of LLMs in mathematics education and \ndiscuss their potential to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics.\n2\t THEORETICAL\tBACKGROUND\n2.1\t CAS\tin\thigher\teducation\tmathematics\nIn recent decades, the significant progress that has been made in the develop -\nment of numerical and symbolic mathematical software, including CASs, has led to \ntransformative shifts in teaching methods and problem-solving approaches in higher \neducation mathematics [5] [6]. A CAS is a specialized software designed to perform \nsymbolic mathematical calculations, such as algebraic manipulations, calculus, and \niJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 53\nLearning Mathematics with Large Language Models: A Comparative Study with Computer Algebra Systems and Other Tools\nmatrix operations. The first CAS was created at MIT in the late 1970s and was known \nas Mascyma. Today, there is a wide range of such programs available, both as free/\nopen-source software (e.g., Axiom, Erable, Fermat, Maxima, OpenAxiom, Reduce, \netc.) and proprietary software (e.g., Derive, Mathematica, Mathcad, and Maple). CASs \nhave been widely utilized in various fields such as engineering, finance, physics, \nand chemistry, enabling researchers and professionals to quickly perform complex \ncalculations. As highlighted in the literature [7, 8], users should verify the results pro-\nduced by a CAS by cross-checking them with multiple CASs and/or by using digital \nmathematical libraries (DML).\nSince the early 1980s, efforts have been made to integrate CASs into education, \nprompting investigations into their methods and suitability as educational tools. \nInitial research yielded encouraging results concerning their use [9] [10]. In addition, \nresearchers referred to the opportunities that CASs offer both teachers as a means to \ntransform their teaching approach and to students who have in their quiver a tool \nfor calculating, modeling, and understanding mathematical concepts [11–13].\nFurthermore, other research highlights a more nuanced perspective on the poten-\ntial impact of CASs on education [14]. These investigations study the impact of CAS on \nlearning outcomes and attempt to identify the advantages and challenges associated \nwith their integration into mathematics teaching. The instrumental approach serves \nas a conceptual framework that supports the research and integration of CAS in edu-\ncation [15, 16]. According to this perspective, CAS are considered tools with which \nstudents can acquire mathematical knowledge, and at the same time, teachers have \nan essential role in orchestrating their use to facilitate student learning, turning CAS \ninto an “instrument”. The use of CASs is distinguished based on their pragmatic and \ncognitive value, with students using them primarily for reasons of efficiency and \nanswer validation. However, there is a growing tendency to utilize CASs scientifi -\ncally, i.e., delegate the calculations to the tool and allow students to focus on explor-\ning mathematical concepts and interpreting the results obtained from the tool [14]. \nThis shift in approach highlights the importance of promoting deeper mathematical \nunderstanding and conceptual reasoning.\nFinally, advances in CASs’ technology, including the integration of AI, have opened \nup new possibilities for users [17], enabling the automatic discovery and proof of \ngeometric properties and providing tutorials for solving mathematical problems. As \na result, CASs are a critical component of the toolbox for modern mathematicians \nand engineers.\n2.2\t Online\tproblem-solving\ttools\tin\thigher\teducation\tmathematics\nThere are numerous online platforms available that facilitate the solving of sci -\nentific problems by providing not only the solutions but also the step-by-step pro -\ncess leading to those solutions. Examples of such platforms include Wolfram|Alpha, \nMathway, Symbolab, Cymath, and others. These platforms offer the capability to \ninput math problems in natural language or unstructured formats, and they employ \nCASs to generate relevant answers. In recent times, numerous researchers have been \nexploring and discussing the advantages and drawbacks associated with the utiliza-\ntion of such tools in higher education [18–21]. One distinctive feature of these plat -\nforms is their computability, as they employ computational algorithms to process \nand solve problems.\nWolfram|Alpha, the tool selected as a representative of this category in this \nstudy, stands out as a broader knowledge engine that extends beyond mathematics. \n 54 International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) iJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023)\nMatzakos et al.\nIt covers a wide range of domains, including science, finance, linguistics, and more. \nWolfram|Alpha is a computational knowledge engine that automatically provides \nanswers to questions while also delivering extensive analyses and graphs through \nits curated data and sophisticated algorithms [22]. Users can input questions in nat-\nural language or use the available tools to perform complex calculations and data \nanalyses. Wolfram|Alpha is a reliable tool for scientists, engineers, students, and \nanyone seeking immediate access to scientific knowledge. It is built with the Wolfram \nLanguage [23], which is a symbolic language deliberately designed with the breadth \nand unity needed to develop powerful programs quickly. To function, it converts \nnatural language, where possible, into Wolfram Language and then carries out \nthe computations according to its algorithms. As it can be noticed, Wolfram|Alpha \nshares common features and functions with both CASs and large language models.\nWolfram|Alpha has been utilized in the context of mathematical education, \nsuch as calculus and linear algebra [24–26]. It offers several advantages over CASs, \nincluding its natural language interface, platform independence, and the fact that \nit functions as a computational knowledge engine aiming to answer broader scien -\ntific questions. The capability of Wolfram|Alpha to process calculations expressed \nin natural language has been a long-standing goal of the research community, \nwhich has pursued it through various projects often involving chatbots. One nota -\nble example is the Sofia AI Project, which features a calculus chatbot capable of \nreceiving questions in natural language and returning the corresponding calcula -\ntions [27] [28]. The aforementioned research has played a significant role in paving \nthe way and igniting interest in exploring the integration of LLMs in mathematics \neducation.\n2.3\t LLMs\tin\thigher\teducation\tmathematics\nFollowing the introduction of the ChatGPT, LLMs gained significant attention, \nespecially regarding their potential impact on almost every kind of human activ -\nity. These advanced AI models are designed to process and generate human-like \ntext by utilizing extensive amounts of pre-existing language data. There are other \nsuch models, including the Bard experiment, bidirectional encoder representations \nfrom transformers (BERT), generative pre-trained transformer-2 (GPT-2), extreme \nmultilingual language understanding (XLNet), robustly optimized BERT approach \n(RoBERTa), text-to-text transfer transformer (T5), and pathways language model \n(PaLM) [29–32].\nEducation is a field of human activity that constantly explores and strives to \nintegrate new technological tools as soon as they emerge. The utilization of LLMs \nin education is being increasingly discussed due to their potential impact on the \nfield. In mathematical education, efforts are being made to discover ways to utilize \nthis new technology, particularly for mathematical computations. An exemplary \nprecursor to such an artificial intelligence system employing natural language is \nthe Sofia AI project, which was mentioned in the previous section [27]. A recent \nstudy [33] presented an LLM, called Minerva, based on the language model PaLM. \nThis model is geared towards problems in mathematics, physics, and engineer -\ning, and its performance has been assessed. They found that the model could cor -\nrectly answer almost one-third of the two hundred undergraduate-level problems \nit was fed. Researchers [34] investigated the mathematical capabilities of ChatGPT \nand measured its performance relative to Minerva. The mathematical problems \nposed to the system are not elementary; thus, their resolution poses a significant \niJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 55\nLearning Mathematics with Large Language Models: A Comparative Study with Computer Algebra Systems and Other Tools\nchallenge to AI systems. They concluded that, contrary to formal mathematics, \nwhere large databases of formal proofs exist (e.g., the Lean’s Library of Formal \nMathematical Proofs), the datasets of mathematics in natural language used to \nevaluate language models only cover elementary mathematics. The researchers \ninfer that on these specific datasets, the mathematical abilities of ChatGPT are com -\nparatively lower than those of a graduate student. Furthermore, while the system \nseems to understand the question, it does not always succeed in returning the \ncorrect solution [35, 36].\n3\t SOLVING\tMATHEMATICAL\tPROBLEMS\tUSING\tCASS,\tONLINE\t\nPROBLEM-SOLVING\tTOOLS\tAND\tLLMS\nThe heightened interest in leveraging LLMs in education necessitates an explo -\nration of the extent to which they can substitute or supplement CAS for solving \nmathematical problems, especially within the context of mathematics education. \nFor this purpose, problems from calculus, linear algebra, and mathematical anal -\nysis will be presented. These problems will be solved using the aforementioned \ntools in order to derive a comparative evaluation of their capabilities. Specifically, \nthe selected tools for the study were Maxima (CAS), the computational knowledge \nengine Wolfram|Alpha as a representative of the online problem-solving tools, and \nChatGPT-4 as an LLM. It should be noticed that in the case of the LLMs, the Bard \nexperiment was also tested, and the results it generated were similar to those of \nChatGPT. However, it was chosen to report only the interactions with ChatGPT, as it \nis currently the more widely used and easily accessible of the two.\nIt emerges that in relatively simple operations and symbolic calculations such as, \nfor example, arithmetic operations, basic integrals, and equations, all types of tools \nyield reliable results. Hence, with ChatGPT and Wolfram|Alpha users are allowed \nto solve a simple problem stated in natural language, without having to know the \nCAS commands. For instance, to compute ∫xe dxx  in Maxima, a user needs to know \nthe ‘integrate’ command and its syntax: integrate(x*exp(x),x). On the \nother hand, in Wolfram|Alpha and ChatGPT, the user can pose the question “ What \nis the integral of xexp(x)? ” and receive the correct answer, along with the calcula -\ntion method.\nHowever, in slightly more complex calculations, such as computing high powers \nof integers or more intricate integrals, ChatGPT seems to fall short [23] [34], unlike \nMaxima and Wolfram|Alpha which return correct results. Yet, in ChatGPT, the user \ncan point out the erroneous result and guide the LLM to generate the correct answer.\nThe following subsections present the attempts to solve four typical problems \nfrom the curriculum of an undergraduate mathematics course using the aforemen-\ntioned tools.\n3.1\t Problem\t1:\tThe\tinverse\tof\tthe\tsquare\tmatrix\nAs an example, we try to compute the inverse of the square matrix\n A /g32\n/g16\n/g16/g16\n/g16\n/g170\n/g172\n/g171\n/g171\n/g171\n/g186\n/g188\n/g187\n/g187\n/g187\n11 1\n21 3\n12 1\n \n 56 International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) iJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023)\nMatzakos et al.\nA.

Recent technological advancements, notably in the \nrealm of AI, have extended these opportunities further and even introduced new \nones. In particular, LLMs have emerged as a significant development in the field of \nAI, revolutionizing the way students interact with mathematical concepts and pre -\nsenting new opportunities and challenges in mathematics education.\nAlthough it is acknowledged in Section 3 that LLMs may not consistently meet \nthe desired level of reliability, they still demonstrate potential functional and peda -\ngogical opportunities. Furthermore, the combination of LLMs with CASs and DMLs \nshows promise in addressing specific functional concerns. In the upcoming section, \nwe will delve into strategies for effectively and reliably integrating LLMs into math-\nematics education and research.\n4.1\t Functional\topportunities\nThe functional limitations of LLMs in performing reliable mathematical calcula -\ntions can potentially be addressed by integrating them with complementary tools. \nFigure 2 illustrates an approach to utilizing LLMs, where users present mathemati -\ncal problems in natural language by posing one or more questions. The solution gen-\nerated by the LLM is then reviewed and refined by the user. To ensure the accuracy \nof the calculations, one possible method is to involve a CAS by querying the LLM to \ngenerate the corresponding commands. The calculations can then be independently \nverified by running these commands in the CAS.\nProblem\nVerify the results with\none or more CASs\nor/and DMLs.\nState the problem to the LLM\nand ask for its solution\nState the problem to the LLM\nand ask for the CAS commands\nto solve it.\nFig. 2.

As per Wolfram in [23] [37], a way to harness \nthe shared natural language interface between Wolfram|Alpha and LLMs, such as \nChatGPT, is to enable ChatGPT to interact with Wolfram|Alpha in a human-like man-\nner. This involves converting the natural language input from ChatGPT into a precise, \nsymbolic computational language, allowing Wolfram|Alpha to effectively utilize its \ncomputational knowledge. The interface for this collaboration can be achieved using \nOpenAI Plugins [38]. By activating the specific Wolfram Plugin, as shown in Figure 3, \nChatGPT will generate the correct answer for problem 1 in Section 3.\nFig. 3. Posing problem 1 to ChatGPT using Wolfram plugin\nWhile CASs serve as useful tools for performing calculations, they often fall \nshort both in providing the necessary guidance on problem-solving steps and in \nassisting students understand the underlying concepts. On the contrary, the new \nLLM tools empower their users to actively engage in interactive communication \nby expressing mathematical problems in natural language. Moreover, users can \npose follow-up questions in order to get more elaborate explanations and insights \ninto the solution process. As a result, LLMs offer explanations for the underlying \n 62 International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) iJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023)\nMatzakos et al.\nconcepts, bridging the gap between conceptual understanding and step-by-step \nproblem-solving. Consequently, LLMs appear to offer valuable advantages in both \ndimensions crucial for addressing mathematical problems: comprehending the \nunderlying concepts and employing the appropriate mathematical calculations to \nfind solutions.\nThe aforementioned approach to the functional utilization of LLMs in mathe -\nmatical problem-solving allows for the exploration of their potential implications in \nmathematics education. Similarly to [2], there is evidence that the adoption of these \ninnovative tools will lead to substantial transformations, not only in the instructional \ncontent but also in the assessment methods used to evaluate the learning outcomes.\nTable 1 presents a concise overview of the primary capabilities and limitations of \nCASs, online problem-solving tools, and LLMs, as inferred from their application in \nsolving the sample mathematical problems outlined in Section 3.\nTable 1.

Pierce and Stacey \n[2] investigated the pedagogical opportunities for educators and learners stemming \nfrom the utilization of mathematical software and provided insight for further  \nresearch [3, 39–41]. These pedagogical opportunities were structured at three dis -\ntinct levels. Firstly, there are opportunities for enhancing teaching and learning \nactivities, encompassing various tasks that can be accomplished through the use of \nthe software. Secondly, the software creates opportunities for innovative teaching \nand learning approaches, allowing educators to explore new instructional methods \nand strategies. Lastly, the subject matter of mathematics itself is positively influenced, \nwith the software enabling deeper exploration and understanding of mathematical \nconcepts. Drawing upon their work, an endeavor will be undertaken to discuss the \npotential fit of LLMs within this context. Figure 4 presents a pedagogical map for \nthe use of LLMs in mathematics education that will be analyzed in the subsequent \nparagraphs.\nFunctional OpportunitiesPedagogical Opportunities\nAssessment ChangeCurriculum Change\nIn the subject matter of\nMathematics\nIn teaching and learning\napproaches\nIn the context of teaching and\nlearning activities\nFig. 4. LLMs’ potential impact on pedagogy, curriculum, and assessment\nIn the context of teaching and learning activities. The cultivation of pen-and-\npaper skills is reinforced as students are afforded the opportunity to observe and \nanalyze the responses generated by LLMs. These responses not only offer students \nan answer to a mathematical problem but also provide a detailed description of \nthe steps involved in reaching this solution. However, as evidenced, LLMs occa -\nsionally produce incorrect computations. This flaw creates a pedagogical opportu -\nnity in which students engage in critical evaluation of the solutions by verifying \nthem either by hand or by using external resources such as CAS or Wolfram|Alpha. \nSimultaneously, students are allowed to engage in interactive discourse with LLMs, \nenabling them to pose multiple inquiries and seek elucidations regarding the pre -\nsented outcomes.\nLearning activities that draw on real-world contexts are of great pedagogical \nvalue, as they can motivate and engage students in mathematical thinking while \ndemonstrating the real uses of mathematics [42]. When it comes to real-world prob-\nlems, LLMs may be useful in various ways. They can accept a real problem in natural \nlanguage and return the steps of its solution. They can also process real data swiftly \nand provide results (note that the accuracy of the computations must be ensured, as \nmentioned in the previous paragraph). Moreover, LLMs have the ability to generate \nreal-world problems in natural language as well as create synthetic datasets to serve \nas test cases [43].\n 64 International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) iJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023)\nMatzakos et al.\nLarge language models can be used to observe the effects of parameters and dis-\ncover patterns. Thus, they can be leveraged to find the solution for a problem for \ndifferent values of one or more parameters, pose “what if...” questions, and observe \nregularities. However, in the current version of LLMs, the capability to explore \nregularity and variation graphically, as would be possible with dynamic geometry \nsoftware, is not available. Despite this limitation, LLMs can still be utilized for sim -\nulation purposes as they can generate the commands for implementing the simula -\ntion in a CAS.\nLarge language models, within the context of problem-solving, interact with the \nstudent textually, numerically, and symbolically. This ability for multiple represen -\ntations is significant, as it is believed to enhance student comprehension [44] [45].\nIn teaching and learning approaches.  The use of LLMs in the teaching and \nlearning process allows for changes in social dynamics and the didactic contract, \nas educators are no longer the sole authority and students gain greater control over \ntheir own learning. In this way, educators may assume a facilitator role and guide \nstudents in effectively utilizing LLMs for purposes such as research and analysis. \nLearners, in turn, may actively engage with LLMs to explore, collaborate, and dis -\ncover knowledge. Moreover, LLMs provide instant information and expand the \nrange of possible resources available to students and educators, resulting in a more \nknowledge-rich learning environment in which both are allowed to explore various \nperspectives and engage in deeper discussions. In addition, differentiated learning \nis enhanced as the LLMs response is developed based on student questions. In this \nway, LLMs provide tailored content and supplementary explanations that align \nwith the specific dialogue established with different students or student groups. The \nneed to assess the responses offered by LLMs presents educators with an opportu -\nnity to incorporate cooperative and inquiry approaches into the educational process, \nthus enhancing students’ collaborative and critical thinking skills. Furthermore, the \nincreased accessibility of information to students facilitated by LLMs encourages \neducators to consider redefining their assessment methods. This shift involves eval-\nuating skills and abilities such as critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and \nproblem-solving rather than solely concentrating on the memorization and testing \nof declarative knowledge.\nThe aforementioned factors play a crucial role in reshaping the didactic contract, \nemphasizing the need to address ethical considerations related to the utilization of \nLLMs. These considerations include source evaluation, plagiarism prevention, and \ncompliance with copyright regulations. Moreover, the redesign of the learning envi-\nronment nurtures a new dynamic that enhances learner autonomy and transforms \nthe teacher’s role in delivering instruction and implementing assessment methods \nso as to align with the dynamic educational landscape enabled by the integration of \nlarge language models.\nIn the subject matter of Mathematics.  Similarly to the transformative effect \nthat has been observed from the utilization of mathematical software [2], the inte -\ngration of LLMs in mathematics education profoundly impacts the content taught, \nthe level of comprehension demanded for mathematical concepts, and the interrela-\ntionships among these concepts.\nThe occurrence of errors during LLM calculations creates an environment within \nthe classroom that encourages discussions among students, between students and \ninstructors, as well as between students and the LLM system. These dialogues \nserve to enhance the understanding of mathematical concepts. Furthermore, LLMs \nprovide an opportunity for educators to emphasize the acquisition of concep -\ntual understanding rather than mere procedural skills. This approach cultivates \niJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 65\nLearning Mathematics with Large Language Models: A Comparative Study with Computer Algebra Systems and Other Tools\nstudents’ mathematical thinking and facilitates a deeper comprehension of the \nsubject matter. For instance, in a scenario involving an optimal linear model prob -\nlem, students might initially rely on direct formula-based calculations. However, \nthrough engagement with LLMs, students gain access to the process of proving \nand constructing these formulas, thereby encountering additional concepts such \nas partial derivatives and multivariable function optimization. As a result, class \ndiscussions centered on these concepts can arise, effectively reshaping the content \nof mathematical education. Each student can seek further elucidation on these \nconcepts from the LLMs, enabling individual knowledge enrichment and stimu -\nlating productive classroom discussions that promote a deeper understanding of \nmathematical concepts.\nSimultaneously, LLMs provide educators with an opportunity to underscore the \nimportance of mastering concepts and applying them practically, moving beyond \nmere skill acquisition. Engaging students in activities where they pose mathematical \nproblems to an LLM and examine the provided solutions and explanations allows \nthem to concentrate on understanding the related concepts, while skill development \ncan be addressed thereafter.\nBy integrating LLMs into the teaching process, educators can explore alternative \npathways and educational methodologies. This may involve the instructor asking \nthe LLM to create real-world problems or provide solutions to these problems based \non actual or generated data. Such an approach offers students a comprehensive \nand meaningful learning experience, allowing them to make connections between \nabstract mathematical concepts and practical situations [42]. Consequently, LLMs \nmay broaden the scope of the subject and foster a deeper comprehension of mathe-\nmatical principles.\nFurthermore, there is a need to cultivate metacognition in mathematics \neducation [46]. LLMs can contribute to enhancing metacognition, as they offer the \ncapability to summarize knowledge related to a concept and provide examples that \nfacilitate the transfer of this knowledge to different contexts. Students’ metacogni -\ntive skills are further developed through their active inquiry and formulation of \nappropriate questions to engage with the large language model.\n5\t DISCUSSION\nThe rapid progress in AI and the emergence of LLM tools have attracted a lot of \nresearch interest in their potential as aids for teaching and learning. Recent stud -\nies demonstrate that LLMs, when utilized effectively, can provide valuable support \nto educators and students across various classes and subjects. While mathematics \nhas received comparatively less attention thus far, it is by no means an exception \nto the potential benefits offered by these tools. The present study investigates the \nutilization of LLMs as alternatives or complements to the conventional tools that \nhave traditionally been employed in mathematics education in recent decades. It \nargues that these innovative tools have the potential to provide functional and ped-\nagogical opportunities that may influence changes in curriculum and assessment \napproaches.\nAddressing a mathematical problem encompasses two essential dimensions: \ncomprehending the underlying concepts and employing the appropriate mathe -\nmatical calculations to arrive at solutions. While CASs have proven to be valuable \ntools for the latter, they often lack the ability to assist students in understanding \nthe underlying concepts and determining the appropriate problem-solving steps.  \n 66 International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) iJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023)\nMatzakos et al.\nThis is where LLMs can complement CASs by enabling students to actively engage in \ndialogue with them, facilitating the process of solving mathematical problems. The \nexplanations provided by an LLM regarding the underlying concepts, along with its \nguidance on problem-solving steps, have the potential to foster both students’ con -\nceptual understanding and their problem-solving skills. Nonetheless, as previously \ndiscussed, LLMs in their current state do not produce reliable calculation outcomes. \nThis issue can be remedied by either manually validating the calculations with a CAS \nor by establishing an interface between the LLM and an online CAS. For instance, for \nChatGPT, this can be accomplished using the plugin provided by Wolfram|Alpha. By \nharnessing these functional capabilities as well as their limitations, educators can \nreimagine and reshape both the content and assessment approaches to better align \nwith the opportunities offered by LLMs, thereby enhancing the overall educational \nexperience and outcomes for students.\nThe utilization of LLMs also holds significant pedagogical potential, impact -\ning teaching and learning activities, approaches, and even the subject matter of \nMathematics itself. In particular, LLMs facilitate activities that promote critical \nthinking, mathematical reasoning, and pen-and-paper skills in students. These activ-\nities involve observing, analyzing, and verifying the system’s responses, as well as \nexploring the impact of parameters, discovering patterns, posing “what if...” ques -\ntions, and identifying regularities. Furthermore, LLMs can be utilized in diverse \nways for learning activities that leverage real-world contexts, serving to motivate \nand engage students in mathematical thinking, all while showcasing the practical \napplications and real-world uses of mathematics. Lastly, the versatility of LLMs in \nproviding multiple representations can be leveraged in problem-solving activities, \nenabling students to interact with the system in textual, numerical, and symbolic \nforms, thereby enhancing their overall comprehension.\nThe integration of LLMs also allows for more student-centered, inquiry-based \nlearning approaches. Educators may facilitate and guide students in using an LLM \nas a means to address research questions, test hypotheses, and discover knowledge. \nDifferentiated learning is also automatically provided by LLMs since these systems \nmay respond to each student or student group in an individualized way according \nto the dialogue established between them. In a similar manner, LLMs may also serve \nas scaffolding tools, offering each student tailored support to achieve their learning \ngoals. This shift towards more constructivist approaches to teaching and learning \nalso calls for changes in assessment that should focus more on the evaluation of \nhigher-order thinking skills.\nThe subject matter of Mathematics, in terms of what is taught and in what depth, \nis also affected by the integration of LLMs in mathematics education. Educators may \nchoose to further elaborate on mathematical concepts when addressing the calcu -\nlation errors frequently made by LLMs in order to ensure students’ understanding. \nLLMs also provide an opportunity for educators to move beyond the mere acquisi -\ntion of procedural skills and rather emphasize the importance of deeply understand-\ning mathematical concepts, their interrelationships, and their practical application \nin real-world contexts.\nDespite the unique opportunities that LLMs offer, it is of critical importance \nto ensure their responsible and ethical use. This can be achieved by adhering to \nestablished guidelines and frameworks, such as the “Ethical guidelines on the use \nof artificial intelligence (AI) and data in teaching and learning for educators” [47] \nand “Artificial intelligence and future of teaching and learning: insights and  \nrecommendations” [48].\niJET | Vol. 18 No. 20 (2023) International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET) 67\nLearning Mathematics with Large Language Models: A Comparative Study with Computer Algebra Systems and Other Tools\n6\t CONCLUSIONS\nOver the past half-century, specialized software tools developed for mathematics \nhave revolutionized teaching methodologies and redefined the roles of educators \nand students. The recent emergence of LLMs will likely have a similar, if not greater, \nimpact. The previous sections discussed the functional and pedagogical opportuni -\nties that arise from harnessing LLMs in mathematics education, highlighting that \ntheir primary potential lies in offering students personalized learning experiences \nand real-time feedback while actively engaging them in dialogues regarding math -\nematical concepts and their practical application to real-world problems. These \ncapabilities can serve as a means to motivate students, encourage their active partic-\nipation, and cultivate their higher-order thinking skills, including problem-solving, \ncritical thinking, mathematical reasoning, metacognition, and knowledge transfer \nacross different contexts. On the other hand, issues and limitations currently asso -\nciated with LLMs’ use have also been identified. One such key issue is the computa-\ntional errors in the results they produce, but this issue, if appropriately utilized by \nthe educators, may prove to have a positive impact on students’ learning.\nFuture research should focus on identifying the teaching and learning opportu -\nnities offered by LLMs, assessing their impact on learning outcomes, and developing \neffective strategies for their integration into curricula and course syllabi in higher \neducation. The highly important concern of the responsible and ethical use of these \ninnovative tools should also be investigated further, so as to ensure that they are \nemployed in a considerate and safe way.\nWith research continuing [49], the increasingly widespread integration of LLMs \nin mathematics education, and the merging of mathematical software with AI sys -\ntems, an unprecedented opportunity arises to enhance students’ knowledge and \nskills in a world that is becoming increasingly digital and data-driven.\n7\t ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors Nikolaos Matzakos and Maria Moundridou acknowledge financial \nsupport for the dissemination of this work from the Special Account for Research of \nASPETE through the funding program “Strengthening ASPETE’s research.”\n8\t REFERENCES\n [1] L.
