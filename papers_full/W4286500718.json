    "abstract": "Abstract In order to overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods for corrosive sulfur detection in transformer oil, Raman spectroscopy based detection is proposed in this paper. The widely concerned corrosive sulfur, Dibenzyl Disulfide (DBDS), was chosen as the characteristic molecule to be detected. A series of oil samples with different DBDS concentrations was prepared. And these samples were extracted by 1‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidinone for DBDS enrichment to improve the sensitivity of detection. Then Raman spectra of samples were obtained, and a linear model was established by analysing the relationship between the characteristic peak and the DBDS concentration. The limit of detection reached 7.98 mg/kg. For determining the DBDS concentrations causing sulfur corrosion, the sulfur weight content on the copper conductor surface was measured by Scanning Electron Microscope‐Energy Dispersive Spectrometer after a corrosion test. The results show that the corrosion limitation highly depends on the type of transformer oil, and the Raman spectroscopy detection can meet the limit of detection requirement in practical condition. Finally, an on‐site oil sample and five Lab‐made samples were detected via our new method and the current Gas Chromatography‐Mass Spectrometry based method. It is found that there is no significant divergence between the measurement results. And good applicability was also demonstrated in on‐site sample test.",
