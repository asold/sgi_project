Moreover, the design method-\nology may vary significantly according to the transformer \ntype (e.g.: core or shell form, instrument transformer) and \nthe applied manufacturing technology [1].\nTo create a competitive design, many non-linear con -\nstraints have to be considered simultaneously to fulfill the \nimposed specifications. The searched design parameters \ncan interact with each other and belong to different phys -\nical domains – such as electrical, thermal, mechanical, \netc. Therefore, the design of power transformers generally \nleads to a coupled, multidisciplinary optimization prob -\nlem, where the problem is not only to find a feasible solu -\ntion but also the cost-optimal solution [2].\nDue to the complexity of the problem, classically, the \ndesign process of a power transformer is divided into the \nfollowing three subproblems [3-5] (Fig. 1):\n• Pre-concept stage: \nThe cost optimization of a transformer design is \nmade in the preliminary (pre-concept, tender) design \nstage. The result is a design study, a simplified \ndesign, which is usually sufficient for the proposi -\ntion and a state of requisition. The design variables \nor parameters of this concept study is called the \nkey-design parameters.\nFig. 1 The classical transformer design partitions [2, 6].\n38|Orosz\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 63(1), pp. 37–50, 2019\n• Final design stage:\nThe final design is essentially the refinement of the \npreliminary design to the most minute and complete \ndetails. Its output is the final design engineering record \nand the drafting and manufacturing instructions.\n• Checking stage:\nChecking of the final design, usually by another \ndesigner.\nThis paper focuses on the optimization methods and \napproaches used in the pre-concept stage.\nThe mathematical representation of this transformer \ndesign optimization subproblem belongs to the most gen -\neral branch of the non-linear mathematical optimization \nmethods [7-9]. The first analytical methods were intro -\nduced at the beginning of the twentieth century [10] – only \nsome years later than the first power transformers were \nproduced [11] – showing the importance of the topic. One \nof the first application of the digital computers in the trans-\nformer industry is an iterative solution for this design opti -\nmization subproblem [2, 3, 8].\nDuring the last century not only the applied methods \nhave been evolved, but also the transformer industry, the \nmanufacturing methods, the construction of the trans -\nformers and the applied materials have been evolved a lot. \nThe first analytical methods just considered oversimpli -\nfied models consisting of only the active materials, such \nas the core and the windings. These models neglected the \nimpact of neglecting the cooling, the insulation system \nor other non-linear component at this pre-concept design \nphase [7, 12-14].\nThis paper provides an overview from the evolution of \nthese cost optimization methods, based on extensive num -\nber of publications.\n2 Trends in Transformer Technology\nA wide range of transformer types exists from the small \nelectronic devices till the largest components of the power \ntransmission network. Although these devices are based \non the same physical principle, viz. the electromagnetic \ninduction. They can be categorized in several different \nways: by their rated power (Fig. 2), the type of the applica-\ntion, manufacturing technology etc.\nThis paper focuses on the evolution of the preliminary \ndesign methods, which relates with large power trans -\nformers (LPT). LPT is a large, custom-built equipment \nin the bulk transmission grid. LPTs are very expensive, \nunique machines, tailored to the customers' requirements \naccording to individual factors such as voltage, power, cli -\nmate, system topology, sound level and others. Therefore \nthese machines are usually not interchangeable, thus the \nreliability is a key factor [15].\nThe power rating level of this transformer category \nhas been increased a lot during the last century due to the \nadvancements of applied materials and manufacturing \ntechnology [7, 9, 16-20]. The first power transformer was \nshipped on September 16, 1884 by Ganz & Company. This \nfirst unit was a one-phase, shell-form transformer with the \nfollowing specifications: 1400 W rated power, 42 Hz net-\nwork frequency, 120/72 Volts, 11.6/19.4 Amperes, and 1.67:1 \nturn ratio [11, 21-24]. The first three-phase unit developed \nsoon at the Allgemeine Elektricitäts- Gesellschaft ('General \nElectricity Company') in 1899 [25]. The rated power of the \nabove mentioned first core-form power transformer units \nwas lesser than 10 kVA (Fig. 3) [11, 26]. Interestingly, this \npower rate would not be considered as a power transformer \naccording to the nowadays classification.\nThe need for increasing grid power and larger distances \ninduced the usage of larger power transformer units and \nFig. 3 The left side of the picture shows one of the first core type \npower transformers, manufactured at the GANZ factory in 1886, rated \npower was 7.5 kW [27]. On the right-side the size of this transformer is \ncompared with a modern large power transformer.\nFig. 2 Categorization of different transformer types by their nominal \npower and possible categorization of power transformers.\nOrosz\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 63(1), pp. 37–50, 2019|39\nthe usage of larger voltage levels due to economic rea -\nsons [18]. Nowadays, the nominal power of the largest \ntransformers reaches the 1500 MVA and the applied high \nvoltage level is more than 1000 kV [20, 28, 29]. The trans-\nformer business and the load of a transformer design has \ndoubled in every 11 years till 1945 when standardized, \nrepetitive transformer designs were introduced from 500 \nto 10000 kVA to reduce the engineering work and the \nshipment times [2].\nNowadays, the term LPT refers to those power trans -\nformers which have more than 2,500 kVA rated power and \ndo not include a winding intended for connection to the \nlow-voltage distribution network (Fig. 3) [16, 17, 30]. The \ncommon in the large power transformers from the differ -\nent decades of the last century is that they are too large \nor too complex for bulk production. Thus, these machines \nare designed customly for the specific requirements of the \napplication, for example [15] states that approximately \n1.3 LPTs are produced for each transformer design [16].\nDue to the growth of the rated power the load and the \nno-load losses are increased as well. In the case of large \npower transformers the sum of these losses can be hun -\ndreds of kilowatts. Accordingly, the diversion of heat is a \nchallenging engineering task. Different winding and cool -\ning systems with direct and natural oil flow has been intro -\nduced to solve this problem [17, 18, 31, 32].\nOne of the main challenges in insulation system design \nis that the insulation system has to withstand the surge phe-\nnomena and the overvoltages likely occur to its operation \n[7, 9, 18, 33]. To achieve an adequate insulation system, the \nelectric field distribution during a lightning or a switching \nimpulse test designed by extensive usage of the numerical \nmethods [17, 34-37]. A further exceptionaly challeng -\ning task is to model the frequency dependent behavior of \nthe insulation system, because the value of the dielectric \nmodel parameters are strongly dependent from the fre -\nquency [37-41]. On top of this, the calculation of the break-\ndown phenomenon in the transformer oil is so complex that \nthere is no a widely accepted model exist [28, 42-44].\nDue to the increment in the nominal voltage levels and \nthe aspect of the cost effectiveness there is a deep interest \nto find insulation materials with better dielectric proper -\nties. The basis of the insulation oils hasn't been changed \nsignificantly from the first transformer oil, which was pat -\nented by Thompson in 1892 [9]. However, there was a huge \ndevelopment in the cleaning and the manufacturing pro -\ncesses of the oils and in the applied additives [9, 18, 45- 47]. \nBasically, two types of mineral oil based transformer oil \nare used: paraffinic-based and the naphthenic-based oils \n[48]. During the aging processes insoluble sludge has been \nproduced in the case of paraffinic-based oils. This sludge \nincreases the pour point, the viscosity of the oil and causes \noverheating and reduced service life [48]. Naphthenic-\nbased oils has been developed to overcome these limita -\ntions, which with aromatic compounds can remain fluid \nat -40 °C But nowadays, the isoparaffinic based oils can \nhave better performance [49]. Other disadvantage of the \nmineral based oils is their inflammability and they are not \nbiodegradable, viz. not environment friendly materials.\nNot only mineral oil based insulation liquids are used \nin power transformers. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) \nbased insulation materials has been widely applied in the \nelectrical apparatus where the fire safety was the most \nintrinsic design criteria [9, 45]. Till the end of the 60's \nwhen PCB's environmental toxicity was proved and the \nPCB's was classified as persistent organic compounds [50]. \nSince then the silicon oil and the synthetic ester based \ninsulation liquids, which flashing point are above than \n300 °C are successfully applied in fire hazardous environ -\nments. There are many other attempts with the application \nof the SF6 gas in power transformers [51]. In the last twenty \nyears, the most promising trend is the replacement of the \nmineral oils with biodegradable, natural ester based liq -\nuids [48, 52-55]. Both the thermal and the dielectric prop -\nerties of these materials are very promising. Nowadays, \nthese materials are competitive and good alternatives for \nthe mineral oil based insulation liquids. Since their vis -\ncosity and aging parameters can be significantly different \nfrom the conventional transformer oils. The application of \nthese new insulation liquids can have a significant effect \non the key-design parameters of the cost optimal power \ntransformer design [19].\nIn the last century, there was a huge improvement in \nthe solid insulation materials as well. The cellulose based \ninsulation materials spread around the industry. In spite of \nthat the cellulose is not the most proper material for this \nfunction. However, there are a large amount of cheap raw \nmaterial to manufacture this insulation, e.g. the soft wood \n[24]. Before 1920, besides the cellulose, which was meant \nresin impregnated paper at that time, many fiber struc -\ntured materials like cotton, jute, silk and asbestos based \nmaterials were tried as electrical insulation [45, 56, 57].\nIn the 1920-1930's there was a huge improvement on \nthe manufacturing technology of the papers and a lot of \nnew additives were found which improve significantly \nthe structure and the dielectric properties of the paper.  \n40|Orosz\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 63(1), pp. 37–50, 2019\nOne of the key achievements of these research works was \nthe kraft paper based insulation system and the pressboard \nwhich was patented by Weidmann. These novelties made \nit possible to drastically increase the voltage and the power \nlevels of the electric grid in the 40's [24].\nA small progress can be noticed in the development \nof the synthetic insulation materials and the epoxy based \ninsulations, structural parts. The improvements in the \nenamel technology leads to the application of the contin -\nuously transposed cables (CTC), which has better filling \nfactor and can reduce the stray losses due to their better \nelectrical parameters. The papers have been improved a \nlot in the 70's, the Dennison Paper Company introduced \nthe crepp paper, which has 20 % greater elasticity than the \nnormal papers, besides the thermal upgraded papers were \nintroduced in the second half of the century [24, 58]. A lot \nof attempts were made to chemically modify the cellulose \nmolecules. The most important result of these attempts is \nthe Nomex, which can be used in the case of higher load \ntemperatures at 220 °C instead of 105 °C as the normal \npapers [24, 28].\nThe electrical steels have the biggest improvement \nin the transformer industry at the last century (Table 1).  \nAt the beginning of XX.century, soft magnetic steel was \nused as an iron core. At the Ganz-factory, these steels \nwere replaced by 2 % of aluminum alloyed steels to reduce \nthe hysteresis and the eddy current losses in iron cores \n[27]. Because of the other outcome of the high core losses \nwas a high temperate gradient near the transformer core, \nwhich increased the aging processes. The average life -\ntime of the transformers was 8-10 years at the beginnings \nof the industry when soft magnetic steels were applied in \nthe transformer cores [27]. The aluminum alloyed materi -\nals solved this issue. After a few years, the silicon alloyed \nsteels were quickly spreaded around the industry as a bet -\nter alternative.\nDue to the inventions in the metallurgical technologies, \ngrain oriented silicon steels have been processed already \nin the 1930s (Table 1). Where the direction of the grains \nis as the same as the rolling direction. This can be signifi -\ncantly decrease the hysteresis losses in a specific direc -\ntion. In the 1970’s Japan was taken the lead in the steel \nmanufacturing also in the case of the electrical steels. \nBecause, with the application of new metallurgical tech -\nnologies the magnetic losses of the electrical steels have \nbeen reduced significantly. These new materials are called \nHi-B (Table 1) and produced in several countries around \nthe world by the same license. In the 80's a most of the \nsteel manufacturers have started to produce thinner steel \nsheets. The average steel sheet thickness was 0.35 mm \nin the 1960's. At the 80's they reduced to a thickness of \n0.05 mm. The advancements in the insulations has an \nimportant contribution to the reduction of the lamination \nthickness [59, 60]. However, working with these thin steel \nsheets is expensive as it requires special tools.\nThe core loss reduction is achieved by alternative, more \neconomical methods (Table 2). Most likely, laser scribing \nof the grain oriented steel sheets is used to break up the \nlong grains in the 'Hi-B' steels to allow easier rotation of \nthose grains in a magnetic field making the steel much eas-\nier to magnetise [17]. Other advantage of these methods is \nthe reduced noise level (reduction by 2-3 dBA).\nThe achievements of the last decades have unexpected \ntwists in the direction of the transformer development. For \nexample, there are comprehensive researches are in prog -\nress on the application of superconducting materials in \npower transformers [61-69].\n3 Analytical Cost Optimization Methods \nTransformer design engineers have long strived for a theo -\nretically confirmed and practical method to reach the cost \noptimal key-design parameters in the preliminary design \nTable 1 Development of the magnetic steels [17, 27]\nFirst application date Material\n1885 soft magnetic steels\n1890-1900 soft magnetic steel with aluminum alloy\n1900 Si alloyed steels\n1935 grain oriented Si alloyed steels\n1970 Hi-B\n1980 thin Hi-B\n1983 domain refined grain oriented electrical steels\n1990 Very thin electrical steels\nTable 2 Loss of some electrical steel sheets at 1.7 T.

The construction of transformers has been improved \na lot, parallel with these preliminary optimization meth -\nods [71]. Gisbert Kapp [10] demonstrated a relationship \nbetween the volume of the iron core and the power of the \npower transformer in as early as 1900. In 1906 Bohle has \nalready created a simple model, where he alredy consid -\nered the impact of the economic environment on the opti -\nmal dimensions of an electrical machine. He assumed that \nthe material cost of the transformers active part ( P) can be \nexpressed as a function of the transformers efficiency ( η):\nPf= ()η .       (1)\nThen he divided the total cost of the transformer into two \nparts: the cost of the active and the inactive (or fix) parts:\nPp Cp fct =+ ()η ,      (2)\nwhere C and c are empirical constants, with values are \nselected between 0.5 P and 1.5 P, considering applied tech-\nnology and economic environment [72], and p is an eco -\nnomical constant which is calculted from amortization and \ninvestment. He extended the above cost function with the \nlosses as a function of efficiency ( F(η)), thus he searched \nfor the minimum of the following function:\nmi n. pC pfcF+ () + (){} ηη    (3)\nIn [72] he introduced that:\ntan, αη() = ()F      (4)\ntan. βη() = ()f      (5)\nThe minimum of the equation system, viz. the opti -\nmal ratio of the losses and the cost of the acitve part was \nexpressed by the following equation:\ntan\ntan .α\nβ\n()\n()\n= −1\npc\n      (6)\nThe main weakness of this approach is not distingush -\ning between the load and the no-load losses. The method \nwas tested on a simple pulse transformer, where the \nshort-circuit losses can be negligible [72]. Therefore, only \nthe core losses and the cost of the active part are considered \nin this case [72] and the optimal value for the core-copper \nratio can be calculeted by a simple graphical method, as \nthe intersection of the two function. Due to the neglection \nof the load losses and many important design parameters, \nthis model is not applicable to reach the required accuracy.\nAs early as 1909 the Ganz & Co. factory produced \ntransformers with different core and copper ratios for the \nfossil fuel and hydroelectric power plants. In spite of the \nfact that the concept of capitalized losses is not known at \nthis time to consider the lifetime losses they have intui -\ntively discovered that the optimal transformer design is \ndifferent in the case of the different power plant types \n[12, 27]. The main difference between these two plant \ntypes that there are no fuel cost in the case of a hydro -\nelectric plant and these plants generates consistent power \nduring the whole year contrast to the fossil fuel power \nplants, which generate their maximal power at winter in \ntheir peak season. To consider the differences between \nthese characteristics of the two power plant types they \nhave produced transformers with larger iron cores, viz. \nsmaller no-load losses and higher efficiency for the hydro -\nelectric plants. These designs were more expensive than \nthe others designed for steam power plants.\nThe economic collapse after the First World War had \nchanged the established manufacturing and design prac -\ntices. Instead of minimizing the lifetime cost of an elec -\ntrical machine, the designers had striven to minimize \nthe mass of the transformers active part. Hence, these \nmachines has high load and core losses, thus the cooling of \nthe transformers were the main design problem in this era.\nWaldo [73] has published an optimization model in \n1929 already considering both the load and no-load losses \nduring the determination of the optimal core and copper \nratio. His approach had already used the filling factors to \nmodel the different winding and core types, while many \nsubstantial design parameters, like short-circuit-imped -\nance or the efficiency had not been considered.\nA considerable literature has grown up around this \ntopic, a lot of analytical methods have been developed \ntill the beginning of the computer era [74-77]. These \nnew, nowadays well-known, findings has made quantita -\ntive statements on the core-copper ratio and the growing \ntrends of the electrical machines [77]:\n• The volume of the transformer (V ) depends on the \nnominal power (P ) – if the voltage level is constant – \non the following way: V ~ P 4,\n• the cost optimal parameters of the transformer can \nbe found, if the volume of the transformer is given if \nthe {cost of the load losses} = {cost of the active part \n+ cost of the no-load losses},\n• or if the power of the transformer is given, then the \n{cost of the load losses} = {cost of the active part + \ncost of the no-load losses},\n42|Orosz\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 63(1), pp. 37–50, 2019\nThese methods generally model the transformer only \nby the active part neglecting the cooling system and the \nstructural components, which together represent about the \nhalf of the total manufacturing cost [17, 78]. These active \npart models use only a two-winding model neglecting \nthe impact of the regulating winding on the key-design \nparameters [13]. Other common assumption of these ana -\nlytical methods is that they neglect the insulation materials \nand us the minimal insulation distances as con- straints. \nHowever, the properties of the dielectric materials have a \ncomplex non-linear behavior and the idea of the minimi -\nzation of the insulation cannot guarantee that we find the \nmost economical solution [13, 14].\nThe application of these oversimplified analytical mod -\nels easily leads to erroneous design rules and practices \nwhich can easily misleads the non-experienced designer \nin the case of a special application or produces non- eco -\nnomical designs after the changing of the conditions. \nThe interest for fast and accurate analytical methods is \nnot decreased after the spreading of the computer based \nnumerical solutions [79].\nThe first computer aided design method for electrical \nmachines was one published by Abetti in 1953 [3]. Then \nSharpley and Oldfield [80] in 1958 and Williams et al. in \n1958 [81] published the first research papers from the com-\nputer aided transformer design. These methods have used \na simple iteration to find the optimal key-design param -\neters in the pre-conceptional design phase. The comput -\ners got around the transformer industry in the 50's. They \nallowed to automatize routine calculations and made \nit possible to apply new, advanced numerical methods, \nwhich is required by the new improvements on the voltage \nlevel and the higher reliability requirements. Due to the \nincreased accuracy, the appropriate solution of the differ -\nent physical fields leads to solve elliptic integrals, second \norder Bessel-functions etc. These partial differential equa -\ntions can be solved by numerical methods in reasonable \ntime and accuracy [1, 82-101].\nThe solution of the preliminary design tasks were one \nof the first application field of the computers in the trans -\nformer industry. Because the rapid solution of these opti -\nmization tasks ensured a significant advantage in the com -\npeting market [82]. The first systematic approach for the \ncomputer aided design of electrical machines was given by \nAbetti et al. [2]. This design approach has not been obso -\nlated till today, this method is described and illustrated \nin Fig. 1. There are many similar methods in the indus -\ntry. Dics ő and Petras published a similar method on the \nother side of the iron curtain [82]. However, the original \napproach was not considered the material and the capital -\nization costs. With the consideration of the lifetime costs, \nthe solution of this transformer optimization problem is \na much more complex problem as illustrated in Fig. 3. \nFurthermore, not only the key-design parameters of a \npower transformer are highly depends on the material and \nthe capitalization costs, but also the specification of the \ntransformer as well [7, 30, 91, 97].\nIn the 50's and 60's the preferred transformer design \nmethods has been determined the product price ( P) and \nnominal power (S) – therefore the optimal core and copper \nratio – as a function of the core geometry. These geometri -\ncal shape functions ( f1 ,  f2 , f3  ) was calculated from the core \ndiameter ( Do ), the length of the yoke and the legs ( lj , lo  ). \nOne of the latest algorithm from this design philosophy \nwas published by Bulgakov [102]:\nPf Dx yo= ()1 ,, ,     (7)\nSf Dx yo= ()2 ,, ,     (8)\nxf yl xD lx Doo jo= () ==3 ,, .   (9)\nThe main weakness of this design method is that the f1 \nand f2 formulas contains the ratio of the core diameter \nand the working window as a constraint. However, this \nratio depends on many other key-design parameters, like \nthe current density, rated voltage and the rated power of \nthe windings [98]. The optimal yoke-leg ratio from this \ncalculation algorithm is between 34 4., <<lloj  which \ncorresponds with the manufacturing statistics. However, \nthe knowledge of these parameters does not supports the \ndesign process. Moreover, it indirectly proves that the \nmanufacturing costs mainly depend on the magnetic flux, \ncurrent density and the losses instead of these newly intro -\nduced (Do , x , y ) quantities [103].\nThe advancement of the manufacturing processes, the \napplied materials and the increased electrical and mechan -\nical stresses eventuated the reduction of the manufactur -\ning costs in this era [12, 103]. Due to the increased stresses \nand reduced sizes the transformers were designed with rel -\natively high core diameter and thin windings at that era. \nThis trend led to wrong constructing principles, which \nincreased the manufacturing costs and the nominal losses \nif the transformers were too big for this technology.\nIn the beginning of the 60's, Csikós [103] recommended \na new procedure, which in contrast to the actual design \nprinciples, proposed to decrease the operating cost instead \nOrosz\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 63(1), pp. 37–50, 2019|43\nof the manufacturing cost. The recommended formula \nwas the following:\nKp kt W=+ 100 ,    (10)\nwhere p means the percentage value of the sum of the \nacquisition, maintenance and installation costs, W the \nannual loss in kWh and t is the unit price of the electricity. \nHowever, this formula was not considered the lifetime of \nthe machine, and the inflation and rate of interest during \nthe life cycle of the machine. This formula was not dif -\nferentiate between the load and the no-load losses, there -\nfore it was not considered the annual load (Eq. (10)) of the \ntransformer. Moreover, the applied analytical model used \nthat design directive as an axiom [45], which states that \nthe insulation system of an electrical machine is prop -\nerly designed, if the applied safety factor is close to the \nminimum of the resultant curve ( Eload = Eallowed ) (Fig. 4). \nFollowing this axiom, the application of larger main \ngap increases the cost of the active part of an electrical \nmachine. Due to the non-linearity of the electrical machine \ndesign problem this design principle does not corresponds \nwith the practice, where the cost optimal transformers, \nautotransforemrs have larger main gap than the required \nminimum [5, 8, 13, 14, 104]. Csikos has already confuted \nanother old design rule [103], which states that if the trans-\nformer designed for maximal efficiency it has as same load \nas no-load losses. Because the selection of the geometri -\ncal and the electrical parameters are not the same in the \ncase of the two different objective functions: the maximal \nefficiency or the minimal losses [105]. He rejected to use \nthe manufacturing cost as the objective function, instead \nof this he was proposed to use the sum of the manufactur -\ning and the operating costs as the objective of the optimi -\nzation. This phenomenon is similar to the modern lifetime \ncost optimization approaches [1, 91, 103-107] (Fig. 5).\nNumerous computer aided design methods were \nintroduced at the end of the 70's to determine the opti -\nmal key-design parameters [1, 91]. Most of these algo -\nrithms solved a significantly simplified transformer mod -\nels with a heuristic search or a simple iteration to find \na convenient, economical solution [108-119]. These heu -\nristical solvers were generally used abstract or empir -\nical constraints, equalities and inequalities to simplify \noptimization problem and shortening the solution time. \nNevertheless the application of these simplifications and \nabstractions makes it impossible to find the solution of the \noriginal optimization problem. As the method was pre -\nsented in [116], which used the same analytical approach \nas (Eq. (10)), viz. this method was determined the mini -\nmal mass transformer design based on the core geometry, \nthey neglected important variables like the flux density, \nthe current density in the windings or the short-cir -\ncuit impedance. These multifarious methods are simi -\nlar in that they neglected the details of the transformer \nFig. 4 A properly designed insulation system ensures continuous \noperation during the planned lifetime of the electrical machine. \nOtherwise, the cost of the operation failure can significantly increases \nthe lifetime costs. The classi- cal design rules assumes that the \nmanufacturing cost of an electrical machine directly proportional with \nthe size of the insulation, electrical machine. Hence, the economically \noptimal insulation system can be found near the minimum of the \nresultant function of the manufacturing cost and cost of failure \nfunctions, when ( Eload = Eallowed ) [45].\nFig. 5 Complexity of the preliminary design stage. The figure \nillustrates the number of the possible designs for the preliminary design \noptimization problem, if the lifetime costs are considered.\n\n44|Orosz\nPeriod. Polytech. Elec. Eng. Comp. Sci., 63(1), pp. 37–50, 2019\nwindings and just calculated by the sum of the excitation \nand the filling factor of the windings [70].\nÚjházy has published an algorithm, which calculates the \ndetailed winding parameters from the key-design param -\neters, e.g. the results of these preliminary optimization \nsolvers [12, 70]. This method was based on the assumption \nthat the transformer optimization process can be separated \ninto two independent optimization tasks: the optimization \nof the core and the windings. The outcome of this assump -\ntion is that the aforementioned method does not consider \nthe retraction of the optimal key-design parameters of the \nwindings on the core parameters.\nAndersen has developed a Monte Carlo method based \ntransformer optimization code (MONICA [118]) to deter -\nmine the optimal key-design parameters. This method \nwas published already in 1967 and extended for electri -\ncal machine optimization, because of the simplicity and \nrobustness of the code. Sarovalac [120] introduced a \nmethod, which – similarly to MONICA – generated a set \nof feasible designs and searched the minimal cost design \nas a continuous mathematical optimization problem. \nJudd and Kessler [121] published a mathematical pro -\ngramming based algorithm, which determines the wind -\ning geometry with the maximal load capability for an \nexisting iron core geometry. Poloujadoff and Findlay [122] \nmade a simple iterative solver to analyze the sensitivity of \nthe input parameters on the key-design variables.\nAt the end of the 20th century, most of the published \nmethods have used the lifetime cost of the transformer \nto determine the cost-optimal key-design parameters \n[1, 14, 91]. A lot of papers and a standardized methodol -\nogy [123] has been published at that time which deal with \nthe more complex and accurate evaluation of the capital -\nization factors [91, 97, 103, 124-128]. The latest methods \ntake into consideration not only the economic but the envi-\nronmental aspects as well [91, 126, 128]. Numerous FEM \nbased optimization methods have been developed during \nthese years to make a more accurate algorithm which can \ntake more aspects into consideration at the beginning of \nthe design process [9, 7, 17, 129-132]. Majority of these \nmethods combine the FEM method with a heuristical or \nmathematical programming based optimization technique \n[30, 91, 133-137]. Most of these methods have searched the \nglobal cost optimum for a power transformer [33, 138-141]. \nThe others have calculated the optimal winding distribu -\ntion or another optimization subproblem [142], like [12]. \nSeveral new transformer optimization methods has been \npublished in the recent decades, which methods applied the \nrecent advancements of the numerical computing methods: \nssuch as neural networks [143, 144], nature inspired evo -\nlutionary, genetic algorithms [143-157] and metaheuris -\ntic type optimization methods combined with FEM [148]. \nBecause of the difficulty of the cost optimization problem, \nbeside the numerical methods, the analytical transformer \nmodels was developed further [4, 149-151]. However, most \nof these analytical methods optimizes for the manufactur -\ning not the lifetime cost of the transformer [148], or solves \nsome smaller sub-optimization task [152-154].\nThe transformer optimization problem belongs to the \nmost general branch of the non-linear, mixed integer \nmathematical optimization problems. Majority of the opti -\nmization methods combines FEM and analytical calcu -\nlation methods with a metaheuristic, branch and bound \nmethod technique [154-157]. One of the first application \nof the geometric programming was the cost optimiza -\ntion of power transformers [8, 158]. In 2005, Jabr [159] \nmade a transformer optimization algorithm with a mod -\nern, interior-point method solver. The main advantages \nof the geometric programming formalism are the follow -\ning: the formalism guarantees that the obtained solution \nis the global solution and relatively large inequality sys -\ntems can be solved in a small computer in very short time \n[158-161]. However, as it was proved by [5] the geomet -\nric programming formalism cannot be used for core- form \npower transformers, because the short-circuit impedance \nconstraint cannot be formulated in the required posyno -\nmial form [78]. Combining the geometric programming \nwith the method of branch and bound, a new metaheuris -\ntic solver was published [5]. This new solver is relatively \nfast and robust compared to other methods [4] and it can \nbe extended to consider the effect of the outer cooling sys -\ntem [78] and the impact of the tap-changing method on the \ncost-optimal design [13].\n4 Conclusion\nIn the present paper, an overview of the literature concern -\ning the preliminary design optimization methods for power \ntransformers has been undertaken. Relevant publications \nfrom international journals have been selected, covering \na broad range of engineering and numerical methods. As \nit can be seen from the numerous publications this is an \nactively researched field. The methodology and the con -\nstruction of the transformers are evolving together. The \nnovel transformer optimization methods consider more \ncomplex transformer models and the recent results of the \noptimization theory. Not only the transformer models, \nOrosz\nPeriod.
