  "abstract": "This study investigated the inhibitory effects of adsorption treatment on the degradation of oil–paper insulation and corrosive sulphur in oil. A thermal ageing experiment at 130°C was conducted using five different adsorbents to adsorb some impurities in oil on the 15th day of a 30 day ageing test, the related characteristics of oil–paper insulation before and after the adsorption treatment were measured and analysed. Meanwhile, a thermal ageing experiment at 150°C was also conducted before using five different adsorbents to adsorb dibenzyl disulphide (DBDS) in oil, energy dispersive X‐ray was used to evaluate the degree of the corrosion of windings. The result indicates that adsorption treatment is an effective method to inhibit the degradation of oil–paper insulation. A molecular sieve, silica gel and activated alumina can effectively improve the performance of oil–paper insulation. By contrast, the antioxidant (2, 6‐di‐tert‐butyl‐p‐cresol) can be also adsorbed by adsorbents, which accelerate the ageing degradation of the insulating oil. On the other hand, the adsorbents can adsorb DBDS in oil, but cannot remove all DBDS. The effect achieved from silica gel is especially significant, which not only effectively improves the performance of oil–paper insulation but also adsorbs DBDS in oil.",
