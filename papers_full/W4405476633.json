    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection require chronic and personalized care to improve outcomes. Large language models (LLMs) can potentially provide medical information for patients. AIM To examine the performance of three LLMs, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Google Gemini, in answering HBV-related questions. METHODS LLMs’ responses to HBV-related questions were independently graded by two medical professionals using a four-point accuracy scale, and disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. Each question was run three times using three LLMs. Readability was assessed via the Gunning Fog index and Flesch-Kincaid grade level. RESULTS Overall, all three LLM chatbots achieved high average accuracy scores for subjective questions (ChatGPT-3.5: 3.50; ChatGPT-4.0: 3.69; Google Gemini: 3.53, out of a maximum score of 4). With respect to objective questions, ChatGPT-4.0 achieved an 80.8% accuracy rate, compared with 62.9% for ChatGPT-3.5 and 73.1% for Google Gemini. Across the six domains, ChatGPT-4.0 performed better in terms of diagnosis, whereas Google Gemini demonstrated excellent clinical manifestations. Notably, in the readability analysis, the mean Gunning Fog index and Flesch-Kincaid grade level scores of the three LLM chatbots were significantly higher than the standard level eight, far exceeding the reading level of the normal population. CONCLUSION Our results highlight the potential of LLMs, especially ChatGPT-4.0, for delivering responses to HBV-related questions. LLMs may be an adjunctive informational tool for patients and physicians to improve outcomes. Nevertheless, current LLMs should not replace personalized treatment recommendations from physicians in the management of HBV infection.",
