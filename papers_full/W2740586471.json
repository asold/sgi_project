Further improvements are\nachieved via model combination.\n1 Introduction\nSentiment analysis of text (also known as opinion\nmining) is the process of computationally identify-\ning and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece\nof text in order to determine the writer’s attitude\ntowards a particular topic. Due to the tremendous\nincrease in web content, many organizations be-\ncame increasingly interested in analyzing this big\ndata in order to monitor the public opinion and as-\nsist decision making. Therefore, sentiment analy-\nsis attracted the interest of many researchers.\nThe task of sentiment analysis can be seen as a\ntext classiﬁcation problem. Depending on the tar-\nget of the analysis, the classes can be described by\ncontinuous primitives such as valence, a polarity\nstate (positive or negative attitude), or a subjectiv-\nity state (objective or subjective). In this work, we\nare interested in the binary classiﬁcation of doc-\numents into a positive or negative attitude. Such\ndetection of polarity is a non-trivial problem due\nto the existence of noise, comparisons, vocabulary\nchanges, and the use of idioms, irony, and domain\nspeciﬁc terminology (Schuller et al., 2015).\nTraditional approaches to sentiment analysis\nrely on the concept of bag-of-words or bag-of- n-\ngrams, where a document is viewed as a set of\nterms or short combinations of terms disregarding\ngrammar rules or word order. In this case, usually,\nthe analysis involves: tokenization and parsing of\ntext documents, careful selection of important fea-\ntures (terms), dimensionality reduction, and clas-\nsiﬁcation of the documents into categories. For ex-\nample, Pang et al. (2002) have considered different\nclassiﬁers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), maximum\nentropy (MaxEnt), and support vector machines\n(SVM) to detect the polarity of movie reviews.\nPang and Lee (2004) have combined polarity and\nsubjectivity analysis and proposed a technique to\nﬁlter out objective sentences of movie reviews\nbased on ﬁnding minimum cuts in graphs. In\n(Taboada et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2008), lexicon-\nbased techniques are examined, where word-level\nsentimental orientation scores are used to evaluate\nthe polarity of product reviews. More advanced\napproaches utilize word or n-gram vectors, like in\n(Maas et al., 2011; Dahl et al., 2012).\n1023\nNovel approaches are mainly based on artiﬁ-\ncial neural networks (ANNs). These approaches\nde-emphasize the concept of bag-of-words or bag-\nof-n-grams. A document is viewed as a set of\nsentences, each sentence is a sequence of words.\nThe sentiment problem is rather considered as a\nsequence classiﬁcation problem. For example, in\n(Dong et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2016), RNN clas-\nsiﬁers are used with an adaptive method to select\nrelevant semantic composition functions for ob-\ntaining vector representations of sentences. This\nis found to improve sentiment classiﬁcation on the\nStanford Sentiment Treebank (SST). Rong et al.\n(2014) have used a RNN model to learn word rep-\nresentation simultaneously with the sentiment dis-\ntribution. Santos and Gatti (2014) have proposed a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) that exploits\nfrom character- to sentence-level information to\nperform sentiment analysis on the Stanford Twit-\nter Sentiment (STS) corpus. Kalchbrenner et al.\n(2014) have used a dynamic convolutional neu-\nral network (DCNN) with a dynamic k-max pool-\ning to perform sentiment analysis on the SST and\nTwitter sentiment datasets. Lai et al. (2015) have\nutilized a combination of RNNs and CNNs called\nrecurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN) to\nperform text classiﬁcation on multiple datasets in-\ncluding sentiment analysis on the SST dataset.\nOther novel approaches use tree structured neu-\nral models instead of sequential models (like\nRNNs) in order to capture complex semantic re-\nlationships that relate words to phrases. Despite\ntheir good performance, these models rely on\nexisting parse trees of the underlying sentences\nwhich are, in most cases, not readily available or\nnot trivial to generate. For example, Socher et\nal. (2013) have introduced a recursive neural ten-\nsor network (RNTN) to predict the compositional\nsemantic effects in the SST dataset. In (Tai et\nal., 2015; Le and Zuidema, 2015), tree-structured\nLSTMs are used to improve the earlier models.\nAnother perspective to the sentiment problem\nis to assume that each sentence with a positive or\nnegative class is drawn from a particular proba-\nbility distribution related to that class. Then, in-\nstead of estimating a discriminative model that\nlearns how to separate sentiment classes in sen-\ntence space, we estimate a generative model that\ntells us how these sentences are generated. This\ngenerative approach can be better or complemen-\ntary in some sense to the discriminative approach.\nThe probability distributions over word se-\nquences are well known as language models\n(LMs). They have also been used for sentiment\nanalysis. However, no trial is made to go beyond\nsimple bigram models. For example, Hu et al.\n(2007b) have estimated two separate positive and\nnegative LMs from training collections. Tests are\nperformed by computing the Kullback-Leibler di-\nvergence between the LM estimated from the test\ndocument and the sentiment LMs. Therein, uni-\nand bigram models are shown to outperform SVM\nmodels in classifying a movie review dataset. In\n(Hu et al., 2007a), a batch of terms in a domain\nare identiﬁed. Then, two different unigram LMs\nrepresenting classifying knowledge for every term\nare built up from subjective sentences. A classi-\nfying function based on the generation of a test\ndocument is deﬁned for the sentiment classiﬁca-\ntion. This approach has outperformed SVM on a\nChinese digital product review dataset. Liu et al.\n(2012) have employed an emoticon smoothed un-\nigram LM to perform sentiment classiﬁcation.\nIn this paper, we compare the generative LM\napproach with the discriminative binary classiﬁ-\ncation approach. We estimate a separate proba-\nbility distribution for each sentiment using long-\nspan LMs based on unidirectional LSTMs (Sun-\ndermeyer et al., 2012) trained to predict a word\ndepending on its full left context. The probability\nscores from positive and negative LMs are used to\nclassify unseen sentences. In addition, we intro-\nduce a novel type of LM using a modiﬁed version\nof the standard bidirectional LSTM called contex-\ntual bidirectional LSTM (cBLSTM). In contrast to\nthe unidirectional model, this model is trained to\npredict a word depending on its full left and right\ncontexts. Moreover, we combine the LM approach\nwith the binary classiﬁcation approach using lin-\near interpolation of probabilities. We observe that\nthe cBLSTM LM outperforms both the LSTM\nLM and the BLSTM binary classiﬁer. Combining\napproaches together yields further improvements.\nModels are evaluated on the IMDB large movie\nreview dataset1 (Maas et al., 2011).\n2 Language Models\nA statistical LM is a probability distribution over\nword sequences that assigns a probability p(wM\n1 )\nto any word sequence wM\n1 of length M. Thus, it\nprovides a way to estimate the relative likelihood\n1http://ai.stanford.edu/∼amaas/data/sentiment/\n1024\nof different phrases. It is a widely used model in\nmany natural language processing tasks, like au-\ntomatic speech recognition, machine translation,\nand information retrieval. Usually, to estimate a\nLM, the assumption of the(n−1)th order Markov\nprocess is used (Bahl et al., 1983), in which a cur-\nrent word wm is assumed conditionally dependent\non the preceding (n−1) history words, such that:\np(wM\n1 ) ≈\nM∏\nm=1\np(wm|wm−1\nm−n+1). (1)\nThis is called an n-gram LM. A conventional ap-\nproach to estimate these probabilities is the back-\noff LM which is based on count statistics col-\nlected from the training text. In addition to the\ninitial n-gram approximation, a major drawback\nof this model is that it backs-off to a shorter his-\ntory whenever insufﬁcient statistics are observed\nfor a givenn-gram. Novel state-of-the-art LMs are\nbased on ANNs like RNNs that provide long-span\nprobabilities conditioned on all predecessor words\n(Mikolov et al., 2010; Kombrink et al., 2011).\n3 Unidirectional RNN Models\n3.1 Standard RNN\nA RNN maps from a sequence of input observa-\ntions to a sequence of output labels. The mapping\nis deﬁned by a set of activation weights and a non-\nlinear activation function. Recurrent connections\nallow to access activations from past time steps.\nFor an input sequence xT\n1 , a RNN computes the\nhidden sequence hT\n1 and the output sequence yT\n1\nby performing the following operations for time\nsteps t= 1to T (Graves et al., 2013):\nht = H(Wxhxt + Whhht−1 + bh) (2)\nyt = Whyht + by, (3)\nwhere His the hidden layer activation function,\nWxh is the weight matrix between the input and\nhidden layer, Whh is the recurrent weight ma-\ntrix between the hidden layer and itself, Why is\nthe weight matrix between the hidden and output\nlayer, bh and by are the hidden and output layer\nbias vectors respectively. His usually an element-\nwise application of the sigmoid function.\n3.2 LSTM RNN\nIn (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), an al-\nternative RNN called Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) is introduced where the conventional neu-\nron is replaced with a so-called memory cell con-\ntrolled by input, output and forget gates in order to\novercome the vanishing gradient problem of tradi-\ntional RNNs. In this case, Hcan be described by\nthe following composite function:\nit =σ(Wxixt + Whiht−1 + Wcict−1 + bi) (4)\nft =σ(Wxf xt + Whf ht−1 + Wcf ct−1 + bf )(5)\nct =ftct−1 +it tanh(Wxcxt+Whcht−1 +bc)(6)\not =σ(Wxoxt + Whoht−1 + Wcoct + bo) (7)\nht =ot tanh(ct), (8)\nwhere σ is the sigmoid function, i,f,o, and c are\nrespectively the input, forget, output gates, and\ncell activation vectors (Graves et al., 2013).\n3.3 LSTM LM\nIn a LSTM LM, the time steps correspond to the\nword positions in a training sentence. At every\ntime step, the network takes as input the word at\nthe current position encoded as a 1-hot binary vec-\ntor. The input vector is then passed to one or more\nrecurrent hidden layers with self connections that\nimplicitly take into account all the previous his-\ntory words presented to the network. The output of\nthe ﬁnal hidden layer is passed to an output layer\nwith a softmax activation function to produce a\ncorrectly normalized probability distribution. The\ntarget output at each word position is the next word\nin the sentence. A cross-entropy loss function is\nused which is equivalent to maximizing the likeli-\nhood of the training data. At the end, the network\ncan predict the long-span conditional probability\np(wm|wm−1\n1 ) for any word wm ∈V and a given\nhistory wm−1\n1 , where V is the vocabulary. Fig. 1\nshows an unfolded example of a LSTM LM over a\nsentence <s> w1 w2 w3 </s>, where <s>and\n</s>are the sentence start and end symbols.\n \n \n</𝑠 > \n 𝑤2 \n 𝑤3 \n \n𝑤3   \nℎ1 \n ℎ2 \n \nℎ3 \n \n𝑤1 \n \n𝑤2 \n \nTarget Words \nRecurrent Layer \nInput Words \n𝑤1 \nℎ0 \n< 𝑠 > \n  \nFigure 1: Architecture of a LSTM LM predicting\na word given its full previous history.\n4 Bidirectional RNN Models\n4.1 BLSTM RNN\nA BLSTM processes input sequences in both di-\nrections with two sub-layers in order to account\nfor the full input context. These two sub-layers\n1025\ncompute forward and backward hidden sequences− →h, ← −h respectively, which are then combined to\ncompute the output sequence y(see Fig. 2), thus:\n− →ht = H(Wx− →h xt + W− →h − →h\n− →ht−1 + b− →h ) (9)\n← −ht = H(Wx← −h xt + W← −h ← −h\n← −ht+1 + b← −h )(10)\nyt = W− →h y\n− →ht + W← −h y\n← −ht + by (11)\n \n \n𝑦𝑡+1    … \n \n…    𝑦𝑡−1 \n 𝑦𝑡 \n \n𝑥𝑡+1   … \nℎ  𝑡−1 \nℎ  𝑡−1 \nℎ  𝑡 \n \nℎ  𝑡 \n \nℎ  𝑡+1 \n \nℎ  𝑡+1 \n \n…    𝑥𝑡−1 \n \n𝑥𝑡 \n \nOutputs \nBackward Layer \nForward Layer \nInputs \nFigure 2: Architecture of a BLSTM, every output\ndepends on the whole input sequence.\n4.2 Contextual BLSTM LM\nThe standard BLSTM described in Section 4.1 is\nnot suitable for estimating LMs. This is because\nit predicts every output symbol depending on the\nwhole input sequence. Since a LM indeed uses the\nsame word sequence in both input and target sides\nof the network, it would be incorrect to predict a\nword given the whole input sentence. Rather, it is\nrequired to predict a word given the full left and\nright context while excluding the predicted word\nitself from the conditional dependence. To allow\nfor this, we modify the architecture of the standard\nBLSTM such that it accounts for a contextual de-\npendence rather than a full sequence dependence.\nThe new model is called a contextual BLSTM or\ncBLSTM in short. The architecture of this model\nis illustrated in Fig. 3.\n \n \n𝑤2   \nℎ  0 \nℎ  0 \nℎ  1 \n \nℎ  1 \n \nℎ  2 \n \nℎ  2 \n \n< 𝑠 > \n \n𝑤1 \n \nTarget Words \nBackward Layer \nForward Layer \nInputs Words \n𝑤2   \n< 𝑠 > \n  \n𝑤1 \n  \n𝑤3  \nℎ  3 \n  \nℎ  3 \n  \n𝑤3   \n</𝑠 > \n</𝑠 > \nFigure 3: Architecture of a cBLSTM LM predict-\ning a word given its full left and right contexts.\nThe model consists of a forward and a backward\nsub-layer. The forward sub-layer receives the en-\ncoded input words staring from the sentence start\nsymbol up to the last word before the sentence\nend symbol (sequence <s> w 1 w2 w3 in Fig.\n3). The forward hidden states are used to predict\nwords starting from the ﬁrst word after the sen-\ntence start symbol up to the sentence end symbol\n(sequence w1 w2 w3 </s>in Fig. 3). The back-\nward sub-layer does exactly the reverse operation.\nThe two sub-layers are interleaved together in or-\nder to adjust the conditional dependence such that\nthe prediction of any target word depends on the\nfull left and right contexts. Note that the hidden\nstate at the ﬁrst as well as the last time step needs\nto be padded by zeros so that the size of the hid-\nden vector is consistent across all time steps. At\nthe end, the model can effectively predict the con-\nditional probability p(wm|wm−1\n1 ,wM\nm+1) for any\nword wm ∈V, left context wm−1\n1 and right con-\ntext wM\nm+1, where V is the vocabulary and M is\nthe length of the sentence. Table 1 shows the pre-\ndicted probability at each time step of Fig. 3. Note\nthat one direction dependence is maintained at the\nstart and end of sentence (time steps 1 and 5).\ntime step predicted conditional prob.\n1 p(<s> |w1 w2 w3 </s>)\n2 p(w1 |<s>, w2 w3 </s>)\n3 p(w2 |<s> w1 , w3 </s>)\n4 p(w3 |<s> w1 w2 , </s>)\n5 p(</s>|<s> w1 w2 w3)\nTable 1: Predicted conditional probabilities at ev-\nery time step of the cBLSTM shown in Fig. 3.\nOur implementation of the novel cBLSTM\nRNN model is integrated into our publicly avail-\nable CURRENNT2 toolkit initially introduced by\nWeninger et al. (2014). A new version of the\ntoolkit with the novel implementations is planned\nto be available by the date of publication.\nHere, it is worth noting that deep cBLSTM\nmodels can not be easily constructed by stacking\nmultiple hidden bidirectional layers together. The\nreason is that the hidden states obtained after the\nﬁrst bidirectional layer are dependent on the full\nleft and right contexts. If these states are utilized\nas inputs to a second bidirectional layer that identi-\ncally repeats the same operation again, then the de-\nsired conditional dependence will not be correctly\n2http://sourceforge.net/p/currennt\n1026\nmaintained. One method to solve this problem is\nto create deeper models by stacking multiple for-\nward and backward sub-layers independently. The\nfusion of both sub-layers takes place and the end\nof the deep stack. The implementation of such a\ndeep cBLSTM model is not yet available.\n5 Dataset\nOur experiments on sentiment analysis are per-\nformed on the IMDB large movie review dataset\n(v1.0) introduced by Maas et al. (2011). The la-\nbeled partition of the dataset consists of 50k bal-\nanced full-length movie reviews with 25k positive\nand 25k negative reviews extracted from the Inter-\nnet Movie Database (IMDB)3.\nSince the reviews are in a form of long para-\ngraphs which are difﬁcult to handle directly with\nRNNs, we break down these paragraphs into rela-\ntively short sentences based on punctuation clues.\nAfter breaking down the paragraphs, the average\nnumber of sentences per review is around 13 sen-\ntences. We randomly selected 1000 positive and\n1000 negative reviews as our test set. A similar\nnumber of random reviews are selected as a devel-\nopment set. The remaining reviews are used as a\ntraining set. Note that this is not the ofﬁcial dataset\ndivision provided by Maas et al. (2011), where 25k\nbalanced reviews are dedicated for training and the\nother 25k balanced reviews are dedicated for test-\ning. The reasons not to follow the ofﬁcial divi-\nsion are ﬁrstly that, it does not provide a devel-\nopment set; secondly, our proposed models need\nmuch data to train well as revealed by initial exper-\niments; thirdly, it would be very time consuming\nto use the whole data as one partition and perform\nmulti-fold cross validation as usually adopted with\nlarge sentiment datasets (Schuller et al., 2015). A\npreprocessed version of the IMDB dataset with the\nmodiﬁed partitioning is planned to be available for\ndownload by the date of publication.\nA word list of the 10k most frequent words is se-\nlected as our vocabulary. This covers around 95%\nof the words in our development and test sets. Any\nout-of-vocabulary word is mapped to a specialunk\nsymbol. We use the classiﬁcation accuracy as our\nevaluation measure. The unweighted average F1\nscores over positive and negative classes are also\ncalculated. However, their values are found almost\nsimilar to the classiﬁcation accuracies. Therefore,\nonly classiﬁcation accuracies are reported.\n3http://www.imdb.com\n6 Related Work\nThe work of this paper is closely related to several\nprevious publications that report sentiment classi-\nﬁcation accuracy on the same dataset. For exam-\nple, in (Maas et al., 2011), the IMDB dataset is\nintroduced and a semi-supervised word vector in-\nduction framework is used, where an unsupervised\nprobabilistic model similar to latent Dirichlet allo-\ncation (LDA) is proposed to learn word vectors.\nAnother supervised model is utilized to constrain\nwords expressing similar sentiment to have sim-\nilar representations in vector space. In (Dahl et\nal., 2012), documents are treated as bags of n-\ngrams. Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)\nare used to extract vector representations for n-\ngrams. Then, a linear SVM model is utilized to\nclassify documents based on the resulting feature\nvectors. Wang and Manning (2012) have used a\nvariant of SVM with Naive Bayes log-count ratios\nas well as word bigrams as features. This modi-\nﬁed SVM model is referred to as NBSVM. In our\nprevious publication (Schuller et al., 2015), LSTM\nLMs trained on 40% of the whole IMDB dataset\nare used for performing sentiment analysis. How-\never, a carefully tuned MaxEnt classiﬁer is found\nto perform better. Le and Mikolov (2014) have\nused a paragraph vector methodology with an un-\nsupervised algorithm based on feed-forward neu-\nral networks that learns ﬁxed-length vector rep-\nresentations from variable-length texts. All these\npublications use the ofﬁcial IMDB dataset division\nexcept for (Schuller et al., 2015), where a similar\ndivision as in this paper is used. To give a compre-\nhensive idea about the aforementioned techniques,\nwe show in Table 2 the classiﬁcation results as re-\nported in the related publications. Note that only\nthe results of (Schuller et al., 2015) are directly\ncomparable to our results.\nexperiment Accuracy [%]\nMaas et al. (2011) 88.89\nDahl et al.

(2015)∗ 91.55\nLe and Mikolov (2014) 92.58\nTable 2: Sentiment classiﬁcation accuracies from\nprevious publications on the IMDB dataset.\nIn relation to our novel cBLSTM LM, previ-\nous trials have been made to estimate bidirectional\n1027\nLMs. For example, in (Frinken et al., 2012), dis-\ntinct forward and backward LMs are estimated\nfor handwriting recognition. However, no trial is\nmade to go beyond 4-gram models. In (Xiong et\nal., 2016), standard forward and backward RNN\nLMs are separately estimated for a conversational\nspeech recognition task. The log probabilities\nfrom both models are added. In (Arisoy et al.,\n2015), bidirectional RNNs and LSTMs are used\nto estimate LMs for an English speech recogni-\ntion task. Therein, the standard bidirectional ar-\nchitecture (as in Fig. 2) is used without modiﬁca-\ntions. This causes circular dependencies to arise\nwhen combining probabilities from multiple time\nsteps. Therefore, pseudo-likelihoods are utilized\nrather than true likelihoods which is not perfect\nfrom the mathematical point of view. Not sur-\nprisingly, the BLSTM LMs do not yield any gain\nover the LSTM LMs. In addition, the perplexity\nof such a model becomes invalid. More impor-\ntantly, in (Peris and Casacuberta, 2015), bidirec-\ntional RNN LMs are used for a statistical machine\ntranslation task. However, only standard RNNs\nbut not LSTMs are utilized. Furthermore, no de-\ntails are provided about how the model is exactly\nmodiﬁed and how the left and right dependencies\nare maintained over time steps.\n7 Sentiment Classiﬁcation\n7.1 Generative LM-based classiﬁer\nOur ﬁrst approach to sentiment classiﬁcation is the\ngenerative approach based on LMs. We either use\nLSTM LMs described in Section 3.3 or cBLSTM\nLMs described Section 4.2. Two separate LMs\nare estimated from positive and negative training\ndata. We use networks with a single hidden layer\nthat consists of 300 memory cells followed by a\nsoftmax layer with a dimension of 10k+ 3. This\nis equal to the full vocabulary size in addition to\n<s>, </s>, and unk symbols representing sen-\ntence start, sentence end, and unknown word sym-\nbols respectively. In case of using cBLSTM net-\nworks, a single hidden layer of 600 memory cells\nis used (300 cells for each forward and backward\nsub-layer). A cross-entropy loss function is used\nwith a momentum of 0.9. We use sentence-level\nmini-batches of size 100 sentences computed in\nparallel. The learning rate is set initially to 10−3\nand then decreased gradually to 10−6. The train-\ning process is controlled by monitoring the cross-\nentropy error over the development set.\nIn addition, we use a data sub-sampling\nmethodology during training. For this purpose,\na traditional 5-gram backoff LM is created out of\nthe development data, we call this a ranking LM.\nThen, all training sentences are ranked according\nto their perplexities with the ranking LM. Using\nthese ranks, we divide our training sentences into\nthree partitions that reﬂect the relative importance\nof the data, such that the ﬁrst partition contains\nthe 100k sentences with the lowest perplexities,\nthe second partition contains the 100k sentences\nwith next lowest perplexities. The third partition\ncontains all the other sentences. Instead of using\nthe whole training data in each epoch, we use a\nrandom sample with more sentences from the ﬁrst\ntwo partitions than the third one. After a sufﬁ-\ncient number of epochs, the whole training data\nis covered. The sub-sampling approach speeds up\nthe training and makes it feasible with any size of\ntraining data. At the same time, the training is fo-\ncused on the relatively more important examples.\nIn addition, it adds a useful regularization to the\ntraining process. Yet, it leads to a less smoother\nconvergence. To show the efﬁciency of our sen-\ntence ranking methodology, Table 3 shows exam-\nples of the highest and lowest ranked sentences\nfrom positive and negative training data.\nmost +ve this is one of the best ﬁlms\never made.\nleast +ve cheap laughs but great value.\nmost -ve this is one of the worst movies\ni have ever seen.\nleast -ve life’s too short.\nTable 3: Examples of the highest/lowest ranked\nsentences from positive/negative training data.\nAfter training the neural networks, each of the\npositive and negative sentiment LM estimates a\nprobability distribution for the corresponding sen-\ntiment, we call these probability distributions p+\nand p−. To evaluate the sentiment of some test\nreview, we calculate the perplexity of each model\np+ and p−with respect to the whole review. Thus,\ngiven a probability distributionp, and a review text\nS composed of K sentences S = s1,...,s K, each\nsentence sk : 1 ≤k ≤K is composed of a se-\nquence of Mk words sk = wk\n1 ,wk\n2 ,...,w k\nMk ; we\ncalculate the perplexity PPp(S) of a model pwith\nrespect to text S. It is a very common measure-\n1028\nment of how well a probability distribution pre-\ndicts a sample. A low perplexity indicates that the\nprobability distribution is good at predicting the\nsample. Perplexity is deﬁned as the exponentiated\nnegative average log-likelihood, or in other words,\nthe inverse of the geometric average probability\nassigned by the model to each word in the sam-\nple. We calculate the Perplexity using Equation\n12 if the model p is based on LSTM, and using\nEquation 13 if the model is based on cBLSTM:\nPPp(S)=\n[K∏\nk=1\nMk∏\nm=1\np(wk\nm|wk\n1,wk\n2,...,wk\nm−1)\n]−1\nN\n(12)\nPPp(S) =\n[K∏\nk=1\nMk∏\nm=1\np(wk\nm|wk\n1,wk\n2,...,wk\nm−1;\nwk\nm+1,wk\nm+2,...,w k\nMk )\n]−1\nN\n,(13)\nwhere N = ∑K\nk=1 Mk is the total number of\nwords in text S. Then, a sentiment polarity P ∈\n{−1,+1}is assigned toSaccording to the follow-\ning decision rule:\nP(S) =\n{ +1 if PPp+ (S) <PP p−(S)\n−1 otherwise .\n(14)\n7.2 Discriminative BLSTM-based Binary\nClassiﬁer\nOur second approach to sentiment classiﬁcation\nis the discriminative approach based on BLSTM\nRNNs described in Section 4.1. We use BLSTM\nnetworks with a single hidden layer that consists of\n600 memory cells (300 cells for each forward and\nbackward sub-layer). Since the BLSTM performs\na binary classiﬁcation task, only a single output\nneuron is used with a sigmoid activation function.\nA cross-entropy loss function is used with a mo-\nmentum of 0.9. The same training settings like\nthe case of LSTM/cBLSTM LMs are used includ-\ning sub-sampling with the same partitioning of the\ntraining data. However, a single training dataset\nwith all positive and negative reviews is used. For\na sentence with a positive sentiment, the target out-\nputs are set toones at all time steps. For a sentence\nwith a negative sentiment, the target outputs are set\nto zeros at all time steps. Since the sigmoid func-\ntion provides output values in the interval [0,1],\nthe network is trained to produce the probability\nof the positive class at every time step. Although\nthe output of the BLSTM network at a given time\nstep is dependent on the whole input sequence, it\nis widely known that every output is more affected\nby the inputs at closer time steps in both direc-\ntions. Therefore, a sentence-level sentiment can\nbe deduced by comparing the average probability\nmass assigned to the positive class over all time\nsteps with the average probability mass assigned\nto the negative class. Thus, similar to Section 7.1,\ngiven a review text S composed of K sentences,\neach sentence is a sequence of Mk words, we cal-\nculate two probabilities p+(S) and p−(S) that the\nreview S has a positive or negative sentiment us-\ning Equations 15 and 16 respectively:\np+(S) = 1\nN\nK∑\nk=1\nMk∑\nm=1\np+(wk\nm) (15)\np−(S) = 1\nN\nK∑\nk=1\nMk∑\nm=1\n(1 −p+(wk\nm)), (16)\nwhere N is the total number of words in text S,\nand p+(wk\nm) is the probability that a positive class\nis assigned to the word at position m of the kth\nsentence of the review S. Then, a sentiment po-\nlarity P∈{− 1,+1}is assigned to Saccording to\nthe following decision rule:\nP(S) =\n{ +1 if p+(S) >p−(S)\n−1 otherwise . (17)\n7.3 Model Combination\nThe probability scores of the generative LM-based\nclassiﬁer and the discriminative BLSTM-based bi-\nnary classiﬁer discussed in Sections 7.1 and 7.2\ncan be combined together via linear interpolation.\nThis is achieved by ﬁrst normalizing the probabil-\nities from the LMs such that the probabilities of\npositive and negative classes for a given review are\nsummed up to 1.0. Note that this normalization\nproperty holds by default for the BLSTM-based\nbinary classiﬁer. Then, the probabilities of both\nmodels are linearly interpolated to obtain a single\nprobability score. The interpolation weights are\noptimized on the development data.\n8 Experimental Results\nTable 4 shows the results of our experiments.\nAll the neural networks in this work are trained\n1029\nand optimized using our own CURRENNT toolkit\n(Weninger et al., 2014). Both the LSTM and\ncBLSTM LMs are linearly interpolated with two\nadditional LMs, namely a 5-gram backoff LM\nsmoothed with modiﬁed Kneser-Ney smoothing\n(Kneser and Ney, 1995), and another 5-gram Max-\nEnt LM (Alum ¨ae and Kurimo, 2010). These two\nmodels are estimated using the SRILM language\nmodeling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).\nclassiﬁcation model Acc.\n[%]\nLSTM LM 89.58\n+ 5-grm backoff LM 91.05\n+ 5-grm MaxEnt LM 91.23\ncBLSTM LM 89.88\n+ 5-grm backoff LM 91.38\n+ 5-grm MaxEnt LM 91.48\nBLSTM binary classiﬁer 90.15\nLSTM LM + BLSTM binary classiﬁer 92.35\ncBLSTM LM + BLSTM binary classiﬁer 92.83\nSchuller et al.

(2015) MaxEnt classiﬁer 91.55\nTable 4: Sentiment classiﬁcation accuracies mea-\nsured on the IMDB dataset.\nWe observe that the use of cBLSTM LM\nas a generative sentiment classiﬁer signiﬁcantly\noutperforms the use of both LSTM LM and\nBLSTM discriminative binary classiﬁers. The\nstatistical signiﬁcance is veriﬁed using a boot-\nstrap method of signiﬁcance analysis described by\nBisani and Ney (2004). The probability of im-\nprovement (POIboot) is around 95%. Combining\nLM-based classiﬁers with BLSTM-based binary\nclassiﬁers via linear interpolation of probabilities\nachieves further improvements. Our best accuracy\n(92.83%) is obtained by combining the cBLSTM\nLM classiﬁer with the BLSTM binary classiﬁer.\nThese results reveal that both the generative and\ndiscriminative approaches are complementary in\nsolving the sentiment classiﬁcation problem.\nFinally, our best result is better than the best\npreviously published result in (Schuller et al.,\n2015) on the same IMDB dataset with the same\ndataset partitioning. Even though they are not di-\nrectly comparable, our results are better than other\npreviously published results reported in Table 2\nwhere a different dataset partitioning is used.\nFor illustration, Table 5 shows two examples\nof positive and negative reviews that could not be\ncorrectly classiﬁed by the discriminative BLSTM\nbinary classiﬁer, however they are correctly clas-\nsiﬁed by the cBLSTM LM classiﬁer. We can ob-\nserve the implicit indication of the writer’s attitude\ntowards the movie which can not be easily cap-\ntured by simple approaches. In this case, learning\na separate long-span bidirectional probability dis-\ntribution for each sentiment seems to help.\n+ve low budget mostly no name actors.\nthis is what a campy horror ﬂick\nis supposed to be all about. these\nare the types of movies that kept\nme on the edge of my seat as a kid\nstaying up too late to watch cable.\nif you liked the eighties horror\nscene this is the movie for you.\n-ve i and a friend rented this movie.\nwe both found the movie soundtrack\nand production techniques to be\nlagging. the movie’s plot appeared\nto drag on throughout with little\nsurprise in the ending. we both\nagreed that the movie could have\nbeen compressed into roughly an\nhour giving it more suspense and\nmoving plot.\nTable 5: Examples of reviews correctly classiﬁed\nby the cBLSTM LM classiﬁer.\n9 Conclusions\nWe have introduced a generative approach to senti-\nment analysis in which a novel contextual BLSTM\n(cBLSTM) LM is used as a sentiment classiﬁer.\nSeparate LM probability distributions are esti-\nmated for positive and negative sentiment from the\ntraining data. Then, probability scores from these\nLMs are utilized to classify test data. Results have\nbeen compared with a discriminative sentiment\nclassiﬁcation approach that uses a BLSTM-based\nbinary classiﬁer. We have observed that the gener-\native cBLSTM LM approach signiﬁcantly outper-\nforms other approaches. Models have been eval-\nuated on the IMDB large movie review dataset.\nThe proposed models have achieved better results\nthan the previously published results on the same\ndataset with the same partitioning. In addition,\nindicative comparisons have been made with the\npreviously published results on the same dataset\nwith different partitioning. Using model combi-\n1030\nnation, we could achieve further performance im-\nprovement indicating that both the generative and\ndiscriminative approaches are complementary in\nsolving the sentiment analysis problem. More-\nover, we have introduced an efﬁcient methodol-\nogy based on perplexity calculation to partition\nthe training data according to relative importance\nto the learning task. This partitioning methodol-\nogy has been combined with a sub-sampling tech-\nnique to efﬁciently train the neural networks on\nlarge data. As a future work, we plan to investi-\ngate deeper cBLSTM as well as hybrid recurrent\nand convolutional models. Another direction is to\nexperiment with pre-trained word vectors.\nAcknowledgments\nThe research leading to these results has received\nfunding from the European Unions Horizon 2020\nProgramme through the Research and Innovation\nAction #645378 (ARIA-V ALUSPA), the Innova-\ntion Action #644632 (MixedEmotions), as well as\nthe German Federal Ministry of Education, Sci-\nence, Research and Technology (BMBF) under\ngrant agreement #16SV7213 (EmotAsS).
