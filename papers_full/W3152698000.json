    "abstract": "Visual transformer has achieved competitive performance on a variety of computer vision applications. However, their storage, run-time memory, and computational demands are hindering the deployment on mobile devices. Here we present an visual transformer pruning approach, which identifies the impacts of channels in each layer and then executes pruning accordingly. By encouraging channel-wise sparsity in the Transformer, important channels automatically emerge. A great number of channels with small coefficients can be discarded to achieve a high pruning ratio without significantly compromising accuracy. The pipeline for visual transformer pruning is as follows: 1) training with sparsity regularization; 2) pruning channels; 3) finetuning. The reduced parameters and FLOPs ratios of the proposed algorithm are well evaluated and analyzed on ImageNet dataset to demonstrate its effectiveness.",
