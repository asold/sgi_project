There has also been a widespread demand \nSteele (2008) and use of such devices leading to the \nrequirement of high output powers. Some traditional \napplications of laser diodes include pumping solid-state \nlasers, material processing, printing, medicine and \nentertainment. Laser bars consist of a linear array of \nemitters on a common substrate, which are connected in \nparallel. Emitter degradation is in known to be faster in \na bar than identical emitters. Packaging-induced strain \nand self heating are known to play a role in the increase \ndegradation rate of laser bars. An attempt to understand \nthis further led to the development of the by-emitter \ndegradation  analysis  technique over recent years Xia \net al.  (2002), Tomm et al.  (2002), Bull et al.  (2005), \nLim et al. (2005) and Bream et al. (2006). This tool is a \nfurther addition to the by-emitter analysis where the \neffects of certain factors that  affect the degradation of \nlaser emitters/bars can be investigated. This study \ndescribes and explores the use of Speclase to simulate \nlasers at the single emitter level of operation and \ndegrade them. The first section of this study discusses \nbriefly the description of the emulation tool and the \nmethod used in achieving convergence of the \nsimulation. In the second section, 3 tests were \nconsidered including the degradation/aging to \ndemonstrate that a lot can be  learnt using the tool. The \nthird section concludes the paper. \n \nDESCRIPTION OF THE EMULATION TOOL \n \nThe simulation tool used in this study, Speclase, \nwas based on UNott’s 2.5D spectral laser model, the \nfull details of which have been published elsewhere \nLim et al. (2009) and Lim et al. (2007). For this study, \nSpeclase was modified to pause at the end of each Fox-\nLi iteration Agrawal (1984) to update the bias voltage \ncalculated by a Lab View control interface. Speclase \nuses Newton’s method to achieve convergence of a \nsimulation to a given voltage, current or output power. \nThis method is also used in the Lab VIEW control \ninterface to control the simulation voltage for each \nround trip in order to converge upon the desired current \n(or power).  \nSpeclase uses Newton’s method to achieve \nconvergence of a simulation to a given voltage or bias \ncurrent. This method was used in the emulation tool to \ncontrol the simulation voltage for each Fox-Li iteration \nAgrawal (1984) in order to converge upon the desired \ncurrent (or power).  \nThe laser simulator can investigate the influences \nof various device parameters in order to enhance beam \nquality and optimise the brightness of semiconductor \nlasers. Some of the device parameters that can be \n \n \nRes. J. Appl. Sci. Eng. Technol., 5(4): 1358-1361, 2013 \n \n1359 \nexamined and their effects investigated are the \npackaging induced strain, intr oduction of defects, heat \nsink temperature, absorption of the mirror, reflectivity \nof the mirror, altering the thermal resistivity of the \nsubstrate, the thermal con ductivity of the solder and \nothers. The focus of this study is to test the validity of \nthe simulation tool.  \n \nTESTING THE EMULATION TOOL \n \nTo confirm the correct operation of the control \ninterface, a number of tests were carried out on a \nstandard test laser structur e. The laser structure used \nwas the 975 nm narrow-angle (<1º) tapered laser from \nAlcatel Thales III-V Lab. The total length was 2.4 mm, \nconsisting of a 200 µm ridge waveguide and a 2200 µm \ntapered amplifier. The front and rear facet reflectivities \nwere 3 and 90%, respectively. The ‘standard’ \nsimulation of this struct ure assumes a heat sink \ntemperature of 300 K and a trap density in the QW of \n2×10\n15 cm-3. All of the simulations use this structure \nand the results are referenced to this ‘standard’ \nstructure. Three tests were conducted as follows: \n  \nTest 1: Single emitter simulations were performed \nusing the Lab View control interface using the \nconstant current mode of  operation to check if \nthere was agreement with results obtained by \nrunning Speclase alone. Exact agreement was \nfound between these tests indicating that the \ncontrol interface was working correctly.  \nTest 2: Further single emitter tests were also performed \nto test the constant power mode of operation. In \norder to do this, the output power from a \nconstant current mode simulation was used as \nthe target power for a constant power mode \nsimulation to check that it indeed converged to \nthe current of the first simulation. The results of \nthis are given in Table 1. It is interesting to \nnote, however, that significantly more round \ntrips were needed to achieve convergence in the \nconstant power mode simulation.  \nTest 3: Single emitter tests were conducted using \nSpeclase with a constant QW trap density, \nbased on the maximum QW temperature. The \ndegradation level observed in these tests \nindicated an overestima tion in the degradation \nrate because it is not physically reasonable to \nhave a constant QW trap density based on the \nmaximum QW temperature. Speclase therefore \nneeded to be modified in order to accurately \nrepresent local degradation processes (e.g., trap \ngeneration due to local heating). The \nmodification of the model to accept a local trap \ndensity distribution makes it possible for the \ngeneration of a trap density distribution which \nevolves as a function of the temperature \ndistribution.     \nTable 1: Data obtained from singl e emitter simulations performed in \nconstant current and power modes \n  \nConstant current \nmode \nConstant power \nmode \nStart voltage (V) 2.000 1.000 \nTarget current (A) 2.000 NA \nTarget power (W) NA 1.065 \nNumber of round trips 11 19 \nConverged voltage (V) 1.66137 1.66130 \nConverged current (A) 1.00002 0.99993 \nConverged power (W) 1.06532 1.06506 \n \n \n (a) \n \n (b) \n \n (c) \n \nFig. 1: 3D plots of (a) uniform trap density, (b) local trap \ndensity and (c) QW temperature profile \n \nFigure 1a and b shows the uniform and local trap \ndensity profiles. Single emitter simulations were \nperformed with a uniform trap density distribution as \nshown in Fig. 1a and for a local trap density distribution \n(Fig. 1b). A more realistic trap distribution was \nattained, as seen in the 3D plots of Fig. 1. These \nsimulations were done to a ppreciate the effect of local \nincrease in QW temperature profile even in single \nemitters. Figure 1b shows a more physically reasonable \n\n \n \nRes. J. Appl.

Studies were carried out \nto do some comparisons using a constant QW trap \ndensity and spatially variable QW trap density aging \nmodels.  \nThe degradation/aging model of lasers has often \nbeen described using the Arrhenius equation Casey and \nPanish (1978), Fukuda (1991) and Hausler et al. (2008). \nThe Arrhenius equation will therefore be used in the \naging process and 2 models will be implemented to \nupdate the trap density and temperature as follows: \n \n• Constant QW trap density based on maximum QW \ntemperature: \n \nagingMaxQWat tkTEAzxN )/exp(),( _−=∆          (1) \n \n• Spatially variable QW trap density based on QW \ntemperature distribution: \n \nagingQWat tzxkTEAzxN )),(/exp(),( −=∆     (2) \n \nwhere,  \n∆Nt = Change in trap density  \nA = Pre-Arrhenius constant \nE\na = Activation energy \nk = Boltzman constant \ntaging = Aging time \nTQW = Quantum well temperature \n \nCase study 1 (single emitter)-uniform QW trap \ndensity: The first case study made to investigate the \ncomparisons for single emitters uses an aging model \nwhere the QW trap density is kept constant. The aging \nwas emulated at a constant current of 1.5 A, for aging \ntimes up to 10,000 h. The parameter being varied is the \nheat sink temperature at: 300, 320 and 340 K, \nrespectively. The emitter power dropped as a function \nof aging time for different h eat sink temperatures of \n300, 320 and 340 K. In Fig. 2, power loss occurs with \nboth increased aging time and temperature, as expected. \nThe percentage power loss was calculated and \nplotted with respect to an unaged emitter. There is a \n10% power loss after ~3,500 h at 340 K and after \n~9,000 h at 320 K, which is more than the acceptable \nthreshold (10% power loss). This quick rate of \ndegradation can be attributed to the aging model used, \nwhich overestimates the rate of degradation. \n \nCase study 2 (single emitter)-local QW trap density: \nThe second case study was to investigate the \ndegradation of the same single emitter using an aging \nmodel where the QW trap density depends on the local \nQW    temperature.

However, the \nrate of degradation is slower than in case study 1 \n(power loss during aging). The lower degradation rate \nis due to the introduction of the local trap density in the \nmodel. Devices will survive the targeted 10,000 h time \nat both 300 and 320 K. However, at 340 K, a 10% \npower loss occurs at ~7,000 h.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThis study has demonstrated how UNott’s state-of-\nthe-art simulation tool, can be used to simulate single \nemitters/bars and age them using a simple aging model \nbased on the Arrhenius equation under a range of \noperation conditions. Simulations were performed on \nsingle emitters to test the tool at constant voltage \noperation of the laser. The results obtained show that \nthe simulation of single emitters can provide useful \ninsight into how individual emitters will operate in the \ncontext of a laser bar. Nevertheless, the actual impact \non the performance of emitters in a bar is more \ncomplex, due to current competition and thermal cross \ntalk. \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \n \nCKA thanks the University of Mines and \nTechnology, Tarkwa, Ghana and the Get Fund for their \nsupport.  \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAgrawal, G.P., 1984.
