    "abstract": "The transmission characteristics of various fabricated square and circular on-chip transformers are studied and compared in this article. According to the proposed lumped-element equivalent-circuit model and the measured broadband S-parameters, both self and mutual inductances are extracted accurately, which facilitates further study of the coupling coefficients and loss mechanism of on-chip transformers. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
