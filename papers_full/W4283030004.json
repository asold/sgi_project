    "abstract": "Earthquake-triggered landslides frequently occur in active mountain areas, which poses great threats to the safety of human lives and public infrastructures. Fast and accurate mapping of coseismic landslides is important for earthquake disaster emergency rescue and landslide risk analysis. Machine learning methods provide automatic solutions for landslide detection, which are more efficient than manual landslide mapping. Deep learning technologies are attracting increasing interest in automatic landslide detection. CNN is one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks for landslide detection. However, in practice, the performance of the existing CNN-based landslide detection models is still far from practical application. Recently, Transformer has achieved better performance in many computer vision tasks, which provides a great opportunity for improving the accuracy of landslide detection. To fill this gap, we explore whether Transformer can outperform CNNs in the landslide detection task. Specifically, we build a new dataset for identifying coseismic landslides. The Transformer-based semantic segmentation model SegFormer is employed to identify coseismic landslides. SegFormer leverages Transformer to obtain a large receptive field, which is much larger than CNN. SegFormer introduces overlapped patch embedding to capture the interaction of adjacent image patches. SegFormer also introduces a simple MLP decoder and sequence reduction to improve its efficiency. The semantic segmentation results of SegFormer are further improved by leveraging image processing operations to distinguish different landslide instances and remove invalid holes. Extensive experiments have been conducted to compare Transformer-based model SegFormer with other popular CNN-based models, including HRNet, DeepLabV3, Attention-UNet, U2Net and FastSCNN. SegFormer improves the accuracy, mIoU, IoU and F1 score of landslide detectuin by 2.2%, 5% and 3%, respectively. SegFormer also reduces the pixel-wise classification error rate by 14%. Both quantitative evaluation and visualization results show that Transformer is capable of outperforming CNNs in landslide detection.",
