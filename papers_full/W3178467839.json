Coronary artery disease (CAD) has posed a leading threat\nto the lives of cardiovascular disease patients worldwide for a long time.\nTherefore, automated diagnosis of CAD has indispensable signiﬁcance\nin clinical medicine. However, the complexity of coronary artery plaques\nthat cause CAD makes the automatic detection of coronary artery steno-\nsis in Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) a diﬃcult task. In this paper,\nwe propose a Transformer network (TR-Net) for the automatic detec-\ntion of signiﬁcant stenosis (i.e. luminal narrowing > 50%) while practi-\ncally completing the computer-assisted diagnosis of CAD. The proposed\nTR-Net introduces a novel Transformer, and tightly combines convolu-\ntional layers and Transformer encoders, allowing their advantages to be\ndemonstrated in the task. By analyzing semantic information sequences,\nTR-Net can fully understand the relationship between image informa-\ntion in each position of a multiplanar reformatted (MPR) image, and\naccurately detect signiﬁcant stenosis based on both local and global in-\nformation. We evaluate our TR-Net on a dataset of 76 patients from\ndiﬀerent patients annotated by experienced radiologists. Experimental\nresults illustrate that our TR-Net has achieved better results in ACC\n(0.92), Spec (0.96), PPV (0.84), F1 (0.79) and MCC (0.74) indicators\ncompared with the state-of-the-art methods. The source code is publicly\navailable from the link (https://github.com/XinghuaMa/TR-Net).\nKeywords: Coronary artery stenosis · Transformer · Coronary CT an-\ngiograph · Automatic detection\n1 Introduction\nCoronary artery disease (CAD), as a common cardiovascular disease, has been a\nleading threat to human health around the world[1,2]. It is caused by atheroscle-\nrotic plaques in the main blood supply branches of coronary artery trees and\ninduces the stenosis or blockage of blood vessels, resulting in the symptoms of\nheart disease, such as myocardial ischemia, angina pectoris and heart failure[3].\nCoronary CT angiography (CCTA) is a practical non-invasive vascular imaging\ntechnique, which plays an important role in the perioperative period of inter-\nventional treatment of CAD. Analyzing grades of stenosis accurately through\nthe pathological information in CCTA scans is essential for clinical applications\nrelated to CAD[4].\narXiv:2107.03035v3  [eess.IV]  27 Sep 2021\n2 X. Ma et al.\nFig. 1.The HU values of non-calciﬁed plaques are similar to adjacent tissues (a), and\ntypes of plaques are complicated and shapes vary from diﬀerent plaques (b).\nIn recent years, computer vision technology has been used to detect coronary\nartery stenosis through CCTA scans of patients to assist clinicians in the diag-\nnosis of CAD. However, it is challenging to realize the automatic diagnosis of\nCAD, because the contrast of the HU values among adjacent tissues and struc-\ntures is low. Besides, types of plaques that cause coronary artery stenosis are\ncomplicated and there is no shape feature that can be used to strictly describe\nplaques, as shown in Fig. 1.\nOriginally, most of the proposed methods were semi-automatic detection\nmethods that require a lot of manual interaction[5]. And then, several machine\nlearning-based methods have been proposed to describe changes in coronary lu-\nmens to quantify stenosis[6]. To a certain extent, these methods demonstrated\nthat the geometric information of coronary lumen is considerable in clinical\nmedicine. Several deep learning-based methods have been reported for the au-\ntomatic detection of coronary artery stenosis in recent related literature[7,8].\nThese works mainly employed the model combining convolutional neural net-\nwork (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) to complete the task. Zreik et\nal. achieved the detection of coronary artery plaque and stenosis by a recurrent\nconvolutional neural network (RCNN). Particularly, they ﬁrstly reconstructed\nmultiplanar reformatted (MPR) images based on the centerlines of coronary ar-\nteries. Next, they employed a 3D-CNN to extract features from small volumes\nand achieved the classiﬁcation of two tasks using an RNN[9]. Denzinger et al.\nimproved the network structure of RCNN and predicted signiﬁcant stenosis (i.e.\nluminal narrowing > 50%) with the combination of deep learning approach and\nradiomic features[10]. Also, Tejero-de-Pablos et al. extracted features from ﬁve\nviews of coronary arteries and employed a Fisher vector to predict the clas-\nsiﬁcation probability of signiﬁcant stenosis according to the features of varied\nviews[11].\nAlthough RNN can capture the dependencies between semantic features in\na single direction to a certain extent, the global intervention of coronary artery\nSigniﬁcant Stenosis Detection via Transformer Network 3\nbranches to detect coronary artery stenosis is hardly considered in related work.\nTo ensure that the model can learn the semantic features of entire coronary\nartery branches before local coronary artery stenoses are detected, we introduce\nTransformer into our method to analyze MPR images from a diﬀerent perspective\nfrom others. Transformer is a type of deep neural network based on self-attention\nmodule[12], which was invented to solve related tasks in the natural language\nprocessing (NLP) ﬁeld[13]. Transformer employs an attention mechanism to cap-\nture global context information to establish a long-distance dependence on the\ntarget, thereby extracting more ponderable features. In recent years, researchers\nin the computer vision ﬁeld have continuously tapped its application potential\nin computer vision tasks[14,15].\nIn this work, we propose a novel Transformer Network (TR-Net) to detect\nsigniﬁcant stenosis in MPR images. The proposed TR-Net combines CNN and\nTransformer. As shown in Fig. 2, the former has a relatively large advantage\nin extracting local semantic information, while the latter can more naturally\nassociate global semantic information. We employ a shallow 3D-CNN to extract\nlocal semantic features of coronary arteries. The shallow CNN enables the model\nto obtain the semantic information of each position in an MPR image while\nensuring the eﬃciency of our model. Then, Transformer encoders are used to\nanalyze feature sequences, which can mine the underlying dependence of local\nstenosis on each position of a coronary artery.\nOur main contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) To achieve a more\naccurate diagnosis of coronary artery stenosis, we introduce Transformer to solve\nthe challenging problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt\nemploying Transformer structure to complete the task of detecting coronary\nartery stenosis. (2) The proposed TR-Net can eﬀectively integrate local and\nglobal information to detect signiﬁcant stenosis. Experimental results illustrate\nthat the proposed method has higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.\nFig. 2.CNN for obtaining local semantic information and Transformer for obtaining\nglobal semantic information.\n4 X. Ma et al.\n2 Method\nIn this section, we detail the proposed TR-Net for signiﬁcant stenosis detection.\nFig. 3 illustrates the architecture of TR-Net. TR-Net mainly consists of two\ncomponents. One part is the 3D-CNN used to extract local semantic features\nat diﬀerent positions of a coronary artery. The other part is Transformer struc-\nture used to associate the local feature maps of each position, analyzing the\ndependence of diﬀerent positions, and classifying the signiﬁcant stenosis at each\nposition, as shown in Fig. 2.\nFig. 3.Transformer network (TR-Net).\n2.1 Semantic feature extraction for local cubic volumes\nFor a certain locality of a coronary artery, the detail of the partial image is\nan indispensable reference basis for doctors when diagnosing CAD. This is also\na prerequisite for our method to detect coronary artery stenosis. To eﬃciently\nextract local semantic features of coronary arteries, we design a shallow 3D-\nCNN as the ﬁrst part of our method. The shallow CNN can not only prevent the\noverﬁtting of semantic information but also improve the eﬃciency of the model.\nThe input of our method is a coronary artery MPR image. We employ the\nvoxels on the centerline of the coronary artery as center points to select cubic\nvolumes from the MPR image, and the side length of cubic volumes is N voxels.\nThen, we arrange these cubic volumes into a sequence of length L according\nto the topological relationship of the coronary artery centerline. The semantic\nfeatures of cubic volumes extracted by 3D-CNN are treated as the input of\nTransformer structure.\nSigniﬁcant Stenosis Detection via Transformer Network 5\nThe structure of the 3D-CNN to extract semantic features of cubic volumes\nin volume sequences is inspired by [9], as shown in Fig. 4. The 3D-CNN con-\nsists of four sequentially connected substructures. Each substructure includes a\nconvolutional layer with a convolution kernel size of 3 ×3 ×3, a rectiﬁed linear\nunit (ReLU) and a 2 ×2 ×2 max-pooling layer. The number of ﬁlters of the\nconvolutional layer is 16 in the ﬁrst part. In the remaining part, the number of\nﬁlters of the convolutional layer is the number of the previous part multiplied\nby 2.\nThe feature maps obtained by the 3D-CNN are deﬁned as x ∈RC×H×H×H,\nwhere C and H respectively indicate the number of ﬁlters and the size of feature\nmaps. Since Transformer originates from NLP and needs to take a 1D vectors\nsequence as input, we ﬂatten the feature maps into 1D vectors and arrange them\ninto a sequence as the feature embeddings of Transformer.\nFig. 4.(a) The shallow 3D-CNN. (b) Transformer encoder.\n2.2 Transformer structure for global sequence analysis\nAccording to clinical experience, a coronary artery branch may have multiple\nplaques, and each plaque aﬀects the blood ﬂow velocity in the patient’s coro-\nnary lumen. Therefore, analyzing the potential relationship between plaques at\ndiﬀerent locations is valuable for clinical diagnosis. In this work, for a voxel on\nthe centerline, there is image information in both two directions (the direction\nof ascending aorta and the direction of the coronary end) that can aﬀect the\ndetection result. To treat the feature maps of each coronary artery segment as\nthe basis for judgment when detecting local coronary artery stenosis, we design\nTransformer structure to analyze feature sequence bidirectionally.\nTo introduce the order information of each cubic volume into our model,\nwe add the learnable order embeddings[16] of the same dimension to feature\nembeddings before inputting embeddings into Transformer structure. The in-\nput embedding for Transformer structure Z0 can be obtained by adding feature\n6 X. Ma et al.\nembeddings and order embeddings, expressed as follows:\nZ0 = [x1 + o1, x2 + o2, . . . , xL + oL] ∈RL×(C·H3) (1)\nwhere xi and oi respectively indicate the feature embedding and order embedding\nfor the ith cubic volume.\nThe Transformer structure of TR-Net contains T Transformer encoders, and\nthe number T of Transformer encoders is 12 in this work. Each Transformer\nencoder consists of two sub-blocks connected in sequence, multiheaded self-\nattention (MSA) and feed-forward network (FFN), where FFN consists of two\nlinear layers with a ReLU activation. Layer normal (LN) and residual connec-\ntions are respectively employed before and after both two sub-blocks[17,18], as\nshown in Fig. 4. For each Transformer encoder, the size of the input is the same\nas the output to ensure the consistency of Transformer encoders. The output of\nthe previous Transformer encoder is treated as the input of the next Transformer\nencoder, the output of the tth Transformer encoder Zt can be deﬁned as:\nZ′\nt = MSA(LN(Zt−1)) ∈RL×(C·H3)\nZt = FFN(LN(Z′\nt) + Zt−1)) + Z′\nt + Zt−1 ∈RL×(C·H3)\n(2)\nwhere Zt−1 indicates the output of the t −1th Transformer encoder. For the\noutput of the last Transformer encoder ZT ∈ RL×(C·H3), we split it into L\nembeddings, where the ith embedding is denoted as Zi\nT ∈R1×(C·H3). The order\nof these embeddings corresponds to the order of the cubic volumes which input\nmodel. These embeddings are fed into softmax classiﬁers to detect signiﬁcant\nstenosis of the corresponding cubic volume.\n3 Experiment\n3.1 Dataset\nWe conducted experiments on a dataset consisting of 76 CCTA scans from dif-\nferent patients and evaluated our method. These scan data have a total of 158\nsigniﬁcant stenoses. We extracted the MPR image of the main coronary artery\nbranches in each CCTA scan. For the entire dataset, we extracted a total of the\nMPR images of 609 coronary artery branches. For these MPR images, 42425\nvoxels belonging to the centerline of coronary artery branches could be selected\nas the volume center points. The dataset was annotated by experienced radiolo-\ngists, and each voxel on the centerline was marked with non-signiﬁcant stenosis\n(i.e. luminal narrowing ≤50%) or signiﬁcant stenosis (i.e. luminal narrowing\n> 50%).\nWe selected voxels in the MPR image at intervals of 5 voxels along centerlines\nof coronary arteries and employed these voxels as volume center points to con-\nstruct volume sequences. To extract local information properly, the side length\nN of cubic volumes was set to 29 and the length L of volume sequences was 30\nSigniﬁcant Stenosis Detection via Transformer Network 7\nat most. Considering that in most coronary artery branches, the proportion of\nsigniﬁcant stenosis in the entire branch is low, we cut the non-signiﬁcant stenosis\npart of MPR images appropriately to make training samples as balanced as pos-\nsible when constructing volume sequences. To ensure that the model has stronger\nrobustness, we made the volume center points randomly move up to three vox-\nels in any direction along 6 neighborhoods and rotated the cubic volumes at\nrandom angles perpendicular to the centerline. Finally, we obtained 849 volume\nsequences, of which 3326 center points corresponded to signiﬁcant stenosis.\nTable 1.Evaluation results for signiﬁcant stenosis detection.\nMethod Metric ACCSensSpecPPVNPVF1 MCCTexture CLS[11]Orig data0.81 0.90 0.80 – – – –3D-RCNN[9] Orig data0.94 0.63 0.97 0.65 0.97 0.64 0.602D-RCNN+PT[10]Orig data0.87 0.60 0.93 0.68 0.91 0.64 0.563D-RCNN[9] Our data0.87 0.66 0.91 0.56 0.93 0.60 0.532D-RCNN+PT[10]Our data0.89 0.820.89 0.50 0.970.62 0.58TR-Net Our data0.920.74 0.960.840.93 0.790.74\n3.2 Experimental Results\nQuantitative evaluation of experimental results can demonstrate the reliability\nof methods in clinical application, so we compared our proposed TR-Net with\nseveral state-of-the-art methods. To demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our TR-\nNet scientiﬁcally, we evaluated accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (Sens), speciﬁcity\n(Spec), predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F1-score, the\nMatthews correlation coeﬃcient (MCC) based on the classiﬁcation results. For\nall model experiments, we performed ten-fold cross-validation on centerline-level,\nwhere the validation set accounted for 10% of the training data. Models were\ntrained for 200 epochs, and the models were saved with the best performance\non the validation set to predict the data on the test set. As shown in Table 1,\ncompared with state-of-the-art methods, TR-Net achieved the best performance\non ACC, Spec, PPV, F1 and MCC indicators on our dataset.\nThe dataset we employed was obtained by marking whether each voxel was\nsigniﬁcant stenosis on the centerlines of coronary arteries. However, the model\nselected one for every 5 voxels along centerlines for signiﬁcant stenosis detection.\nTherefore, there was a tolerable error between correct detection results and an-\nnotations at signiﬁcant stenosis boundaries. If the error was less than 5 voxels,\nthe detection results obtained by the model were considered correct. According\nto several representative examples of signiﬁcant stenosis detection in Fig. 5, an-\nnotations and our detection results had high consistency. Experimental results\ndemonstrated that TR-Net could eﬀectively detect signiﬁcant stenosis caused by\nvarious types of plaques, including non-calciﬁed plaques that are diﬃcult to de-\n8 X. Ma et al.\ntect. The detection results of our method had outstanding continuity, and there\nwas almost no interruption when dealing with long-length signiﬁcant stenosis.\nFig. 5.Examples of signiﬁcant stenosis detection. Volume center points are denoted\nby orange ×. (Color ﬁgure online)\n4 Conclusion\nIn this work, we have proposed TR-Net to solve the challenging task of automati-\ncally detecting signiﬁcant stenosis in MPR images. Our TR-Net can well combine\nthe information of local areas adjacent to stenoses and the global information\nof coronary artery branches when detecting signiﬁcant stenosis. Experimental\nresults have demonstrated that TR-Net has better performance on multiple in-\ndicators compared with state-of-the-art methods. Through more comprehensive\ninformation analysis of coronary arteries in MPR images, our method can achieve\nthe purpose of the computer-assisted diagnosis of CAD.\nAcknowledgments.
