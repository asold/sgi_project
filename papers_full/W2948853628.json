INTRODUCTION\nThe operation state of power transformer is closely related\nto the reliable operation of the power grid. During the\noperation time of transformer, the short circuit current and\nelectro-magnetic force would cause damage to the transfer,\nand the mechanical failure is the most serious type [1]–[3].\nThe mechanical failures are mainly resulted from the winding\nor core, and it is hard to be recognized in its early stage,\nso the mechanical failure would always cause great economic\nloss [4], [5]. Therefore, it is essential to ﬁnd the transformer’s\nmechanical failure in early stage.\nSeveral transformer fault diagnosis approaches have\nalready been proposed. The dissolved gas analysis (DGA)\nand low voltage impulse test (LVI) are able to distin-\nguish the faults’ type, but the fault’s location cannot be\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Vincenzo Piuri.\ndetermined [6], [7]. Frequency response analysis (FRA) [8]\nhas high diagnosis accuracy, but the low voltage winding\nneeds to be disconnected during the measurement process.\nShort circuit reactance (SCR) [9] is capable of realizing live-\nline measurement, so the transformer can keep operating\nduring the measurement procedure. But the failure’s location\nand category cannot be obtained [12]. Recently, Ultra-Wide\nBand (UWB) technique is proposed in the ﬁeld of transformer\nfault diagnosis, and both the location and type of failure can\nbe obtained [13], [14]. For the time being, this approach\ncan only detect the condition of winding. Moreover, this\nmethod needs UWB transceivers and Vivaldi antenna for\nmeasurement, it would increase the diagnosis cost. Vibration\nanalysis has drawn great attention in the ﬁeld of mechanical\nfault diagnosis since it is easy to be realized and charac-\nterized as live line measurement [15]–[21]. In our previ-\nous study [22]–[24], we have employed RFID sensor and\nthe vibration analysis approach to realize non-intrusive fault\nVOLUME 7, 2019\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Wanget al.: Transformer Incipient Hybrid Fault Diagnosis\ndiagnosis and prognosis of transformer with low costs and\nhigh accuracy. In [23] the stacked denoising autoencoder\nis employed for transformer fault diagnosis and has shown\nsatisfactory performance, it focuses on the diagnosis of single\nfault, when several types of fault happen simultaneously, they\ncannot achieve satisfactory result. Moreover, all these meth-\nods perform fault diagnosis after the fault happens, so the\ntransformer has already been damaged and caused the eco-\nnomic loss. Therefore, this paper aims to realize the fault\ndiagnosis when the failure is in the incubation period, which\nis the incipient fault diagnosis. In this period, the failure\nshows no inﬂuence on the transformer operation, but the\nfailure may deteriorate rapidly in the following time, resulting\nin the shutdown of transformer. In this way, the transformer\ncan be ﬁxed before serious failure happens, and the economic\nloss can be signiﬁcantly reduced.\nIn the ﬁeld of mechanical fault diagnosis, a lot of signal\nprocessing approaches are employed, such as Wavelet packet\ntransform [25], HHT analysis [26], time-frequency analy-\nsis [27], [28], and sparse representation [29], [30]. However,\nthe state-of-art approaches requires deep understanding on\nthe fault signal and prior knowledge about signal processing\nand mechanical system. With the rapid development of com-\nputer science, the deep learning approach has been a hot topic\nespecially in recent years. The deep learning technique tries\nto train a deep neural network that can realize automatically\nfeature extraction and other tasks [31]–[33].\nThe deep belief network (DBN) [34]–[36] is an unsu-\npervised deep learning approach which has proven to be\neffective in terms of feature extraction. DBN can effectively\navoid the over-ﬁtting phenomenon to the training data set\nvia unsupervised pre-training. Compared with the traditional\nunsupervised models, DBN can obtain the laws in the deep\nlayer which hiding in multiple features and achieve better\ngeneralization ability. Therefore, this paper employs DBN\nfor feature extraction of transformer hybrid incipient faults.\nIn existing studies, the hidden layer structure and learning\nrate is set on the basis of experience, but the feature learn-\ning performance cannot always be optimum. To solve this\nproblem, the quantum behaved particle swarm optimization\nalgorithm (QPSO) is employed to ﬁnd the optimum hidden\nlayer structure and learning rate.\nThe frequency spectrum is employed as the input data\nfor feature extraction and has achieved diagnosis accuracy\nover 97% [37], [38]. Therefore, in this paper, the frequency\nspectrum obtained by EEMD is used as the input of DBN.\nThis work aims to introduce a hybrid fault diagnosis\nmethod for transformer mechanical failure in early stage with\nadvantages of high accuracy, low cost and high stability.\nCompared with previous research, this paper realizes the\ndiagnosis for transformer incipient hybrid fault. To realize\noptimum diagnosis performance, the hidden layer structure\nand learning rate of DBN is optimized by using QPSO algo-\nrithm, besides, the envelop spectrum of raw signal is selected\nas the input data to further improve the diagnosis perfor-\nmance. The solar-powered RFID sensor design is shown in\nSection II. Section III describes the theories of fault diagnosis.\nSection IV discusses the experiments detail and results. The\nconclusion drawn from the study is shown in Section V .\nII. SOLAR-POWERED RFID SENSOR\nFig. 1 is the solar powered RFID sensor that employed\nfor vibration signal acquisition, it has the same struc-\nture with that of in [24]. The low dropout voltage reg-\nulator (TPS780180300DRVR) is adopted to stabilize the\noutput voltage of solar panel and supercapacitor. In this\ndesign strategy, the MSP430FR5964 MCU is used for sig-\nnal processing, it has fast written speed which can write\n64kB data within 4ms, and its power consumption is\n118 µA/MHz in active mode. The vibration signal is col-\nlected by ADXL372 accelerometer sensor which current con-\nsumption is 22 µA under 2.5V voltage when measuring. The\nRFID chip is a typical Monza X-8K, which memory could be\naccessed by the I 2C interface and UHF interface.\nFIGURE 1. Proposed RFID sensor.\nAs described in [23], a Faraday cage which inner side\nis made of epoxy resin is employed to reduce the electro-\nmagnetic interference to the sensor. Meanwhile, it can also\nprevent the RFID sensor being damaged by induction voltage.\nSince the RFID sensor employed in this paper utilizes solar\nenergy as power source, so the solar panel should be outside\nof the Faraday cage, Fig. 2 shows the packaged RFID sensor.\nFIGURE 2. Packaged solar-powered RFID sensor.\n74104 VOLUME 7, 2019\nT. Wanget al.: Transformer Incipient Hybrid Fault Diagnosis\nIII. THEORY\nA. RESTRICTED BOLTZMANN MACHINE\nThe DBN model is constructed by Restricted Boltzman\nMachine (RBM) via a greedy layer-wise training princi-\nple [34]. The RBM model consists of two layers including\na visible layer v={0, 1} D and a hidden layer h={0, 1} K ,\nthe architecture of RBM is shown in Fig. 3. Both the visible\nlayer and the hidden layer contains a series of units, and the\ninput data are fed into the visible layer. The energy conﬁgu-\nration of the layers is deﬁned as:\nE(v,h) =−\nD∑\np=1\nK∑\nq=1\nvpwpqhq −\nD∑\np=1\ncpvp −\nK∑\nq=1\nbqhq (1)\nwhere wpq is the weight between the visible unit p and hidden\nunit q; cp and bq are the bias term of visible unit p and hidden\nunit q, respectively.\nFIGURE 3. Structure of RBM.\nThe joint distribution of the layers is deﬁned as:\nt(v,h) =1\nZ exp(−E(v,h)) (2)\nwhere Z is the normalization constant. From the equation,\nit can be seen that the probability could be increased by\ndecreasing the energy.\nThe conditional distribution of visible layer v and hidden\nlayer h can be calculated by the following equations:\nt(hq =1 |v ) =σ(\n∑\np\nwpqvp +bq) (3)\nt(vp =1 |h ) =σ(\n∑\nq\nwpqhq +cp) (4)\nσ(s) = 1\n1 +exp(−s) (5)\nThe contrastive divergence approach is employed to update\nthe weights, and the weights’ variation is calculated by the\nfollowing equation:\n1wpq =ε(vphqorigin −vphqreconstruct) (6)\nFIGURE 4. Reconstruction procedure of RBM.\nwhere εis the learning rate. Every RBM model has its own\nlearning rate and the optimum learning rate can generate the\nsuitable weights distribution.\nThe reconstruction procedure of RBM is shown in Fig. 4.\nIn this procedure, the hidden layer makes attempt to recon-\nstruct a visible layer v1 which can recover the original visible\nlayer v. Then the data obtained in the hidden layer can be\nthought to be the features of the input data. If the recon-\nstructed data can perfectly recover the original input data,\nthe hidden layer is thought to be effective in terms of learning\nrobust features from the original data.\nB. DBN STRUCTURE\nGenerally, a single stage RBM cannot realize optimum fea-\nture learning performance. Thus, several RBMs are stacked\nto form a deep structure to extract features well. The fea-\ntures extracted by the ﬁrst RBM are input to the next RBM.\nFig. 5 shows the whole training process of a typical DBN\nwith two-stage RBM, the process contains a pre-training and\nFIGURE 5. The structure of DBN.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 74105\nT. Wanget al.: Transformer Incipient Hybrid Fault Diagnosis\na ﬁne-tuning procedure, and the output layer is generally\nemploying the Softmax classiﬁer.\nDuring the pre-training procedure, the input data are pro-\ncessed by the ﬁrst RBM and the features are learnt, then the\nlearnt features are employed as the input data of the second\nRBM and the second RBM’s features are obtained. This pro-\ncedure is running in this manner repeatedly, and the features\nobtained by the last RBM is the extracted features in the\npre-training procedure. After that, the features are input into\nthe Softmax classiﬁer layer for ﬁne-tuning.\nThe pre-trained DBN model is ﬁne-tuned by the Softmax\nclassiﬁer during the ﬁne-tuning process. The Softmax clas-\nsiﬁer is employed to classify the extracted features in the\npre-training process and generate the labels of the features.\nThen, the generated labels are compared with the input data\nlabel and the back-propagation mechanism is employed to\nminimize the error between these two kinds of labels by\nupdating the weights in the RBM. After the ﬁne-tuning pro-\ncess is ﬁnished, the features extracted by the new last RBM\nis thought to be the learnt features of DBN model.\nThe learning rate and RBM layers are important parame-\nters to the DBN model, which would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence\nthe feature extraction performance of DBN. Traditionally,\nthese two parameters are selected according to experience,\nwhich cannot always ﬁnd the optimal results. Therefore,\nin this paper, QPSO is employed to ﬁnd the optimal values\nof these two parameters.\nC. QPSO\nQPSO algorithm introduces the quantum behavior into the\nconvergence mechanism of particle swarm algorithm [39].\nSince the quantum behavior characterized as polymorphic\nand uncertain, it can force the particle can appear at any point\nin space with some probability and satisfy the requirements of\naggregation state in properties difference, so that the particle\ncan search for the global optimal solution more efﬁciently in\nthe whole space. The particle in QPSO algorithm is iterated\nas following:\nmbest = 1\nM\nM∑\ni=1\nPi (7)\nP =µPi +(1 −µ)Pj (8)\nXi(t +1) =P ±α|mbest −Xi(t)|ln(1/u) (9)\nwhere M is the population size, µand u are the random num-\nbers with uniform distribution on the interval [0, 1], mbest is\nthe average position of the optimal position of all particles, Pi\nand Pj is the individual optimal position and global optimal\nposition of i-th particle. X(t) is the position of i-th particle\nin the t-th iteration, α is the compressive expansion factor.\nThe process of optimizing DBN model by using QPSO can\nbe described as following:\nStep 1: initialize QPSO, including the particle position, the\nsearching space, the compressive expansion factor and the\niterations, the learning rate and number of hidden layer nodes\nof DBN is projected as the position of particle;\nStep 2: calculate the ﬁtness value of every particle in the\ngroup, then calculate the individual optimal position of each\nparticle and the global optimal position of group;\nStep 3: calculate the average value of the individual optimal\nposition of all the particles and then update the particles’\nposition;\nStep 4: repeat step1to step 3 until meeting the condition\nof convergence, and the optimization result is the optimal\nlearning rate and number of hidden layer nodes of DBN\nmodel.\nThe employed ﬁtness function during the optimization\nprocess is:\nﬁt = 1\nRMSE (10)\nwhere RMSE is the root-mean-square error, when the maxi-\nmum ﬁtness value obtained, the output result is the optimal\nsolution of learning rate. The whole process is illustrated\nin Fig. 6.\nFIGURE 6. The flow chart of optimizing learning rate.\nIV. MEASUREMENT RESUTLS\nA. EXPERIMENT SETUP\nIn this experiment, an 110kV three-phase transformer (Fig. 7)\nis adopted as the test object. The RFID sensor is installed\non the shell of transformer for vibration signal acquisition.\nTable 1 shows the main parameters of the test object.\nTABLE 1. Parameters of testing transformer.\nTo evaluate the communication performance of the pack-\naged RFID sensor, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is mea-\nsured. Fig. 8 shows the measurement results. It can be seen\nthat the packaged sensor shows higher SNR. The RFID\n74106 VOLUME 7, 2019\nT. Wanget al.: Transformer Incipient Hybrid Fault Diagnosis\nFIGURE 7. Test environment.\nFIGURE 8. SNR measured at different communication distances.\nsystem requires at least 30dB SNR for regular communica-\ntion [45], thus, from Fig. 8 it can be deduced that the pack-\naged sensor achieves the maximum communication distance\nof 17.5m.\nTen health conditions of transformer including one nor-\nmal condition, nine hybrid faults conditions are adopted for\ndiagnosis. The object transformer operates under rated load\npower. In order to obtain the data of all the hybrid faults con-\nditions, several customized windings and cores are employed\n(shown in Fig. 9), and each winding or core is artiﬁcially\ndamaged to simulate the failure in actual operation.\nTable 2 shows the information about these ten conditions,\nW represents winding, C represents core, D represents defor-\nmation, L represents looseness, and O represents overlapping.\nFor each condition under rated load, 1000 signals are col-\nlected, it need to be noticed that the frequency spectrum of\nthe vibration signal rather than the signal itself is employed\nas the input value of DBN. The sample data are normalized\nbefore being used for training:\nxnorm = x −xmin\nxmax −xmin\n(11)\nFIGURE 9. (a) Customized winding; (b) customized core.\nTABLE 2.

Optimized hidden layer structure and learning rate.\nwhere x norm denotes the normalized value, x min is the min-\nimum value and x max is and maximum value. Half of the\nsamples are used as training data and the other half as test\ndata.\nB. PERFORMANCE OF QPSO\nThe hidden layer structure and learning rate should be deter-\nmined before the feature learning process. In order to eval-\nuate the optimization performance of QPSO, particle swarm\nalgorithm (PSO), fruit ﬂy optimization algorithm (FOA) and\nquantum genetic algorithm (QGA) are also adopted to deter-\nmine the hidden layers’ structure and learning rate. The opti-\nmization process of all the optimization process are shown in\nFig. 10, the hidden layer structure and learning rate are shown\nin Table 3. in Fig. 10, the QPSO achieves the best optimiza-\ntion result with minimum ﬁtness value and iterations.\nFrom Table 3 it can be seen that the DBN optimized by\nQPSO shows highest training accuracy and test accuracy,\nVOLUME 7, 2019 74107\nT. Wanget al.: Transformer Incipient Hybrid Fault Diagnosis\nFIGURE 10. The optimization process of different algorithms.\nmeanwhile, its optimizing time is less than that of PSO and\nQGA. So, the hidden layer structure of the DBN is 4096-\n1033-789-847-10, 4096 is the dimension of input data, 10 is\nthe corresponding to the number of transformer condition.\nC. PERFORMANCE OF DBN\nThe performance of DBN in feature learning is compared\nwith that of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA)\napproach. The test data set contains the ten kinds of con-\nditions listed in Table 2, and the hidden layer structure and\nlearning rate of DBN are determined by using QPSO. Both\nthe two approaches are employed to extract features from the\ntest data set, and the t-SNE (T-Distribution Stochastic Neigh-\nbor Embedding) [37] is used to realize the visualization of\nhigh dimensional data into a two-dimension feature distribu-\ntion. The results are shown in Fig. 11, Fig. 11(a) is distribution\nof raw data, Fig. 11(b) is the feature extracted by KPCA, and\nFig. 11(c) is the feature extracted by optimized DBN. When\ndealing with the hybrid fault conditions, the KPCA method\ncannot acquire discriminative features, some of the features\nare mixed. The optimized DBN is able to learn succinct and\ndiscriminative features from the hybrid fault signal, which\nguarantees the fault diagnosis accuracy.\nThe diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method is com-\npared with the traditional approaches, all the approaches are\noptimized by QPSO and the results are shown in Table 4.\nThe kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), indepen-\ndent component analysis (ICA) and DBN are employed to\nextract features from the data, respectively, and the support\nvector machine (SVM) is employed for classiﬁcation of the\nextracted features. It can be seen that under hybrid faults\nconditions, the proposed DBN achieves the best diagnosis\nresults with highest accuracy and minimal time.\nTo further evaluate the priority of the introduced Hilbert\nenvelop spectrum in term of fault diagnosis, the raw vibration\nsignal in time domain (F1) and its frequency spectrum (F2)\nare employed as the input data of SSDA, respectively. The\nSSDA are optimized by QPSO algorithm, the results are\nlisted in Table 5. For these three kinds of input data, the\nFIGURE 11.

But the test\naccuracy is different for different input data, F1 shows the\nminimal test accuracy, F2 ranks the second and the introduced\n74108 VOLUME 7, 2019\nT. Wanget al.: Transformer Incipient Hybrid Fault Diagnosis\nTABLE 4. Fault diagnosis performance comparison.\nTABLE 5. Fault diagnosis performance of Different input feature data.\ninput data in this paper achieves the highest test accuracy.\nThis experiment indicates that the feature extracted from F1\ncannot represent the whole character of raw signal. As for the\nfrequency spectrum and Hilbert envelop spectrum, the Hilbert\nenvelop spectrum achieves higher test accuracy. Therefore,\nit can be deduced that the Hilbert envelop spectrum is more\nsensitive to the fault and has better robustness compared with\nthe other two kinds of input data.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this study, a non-invasive, low cost and high accuracy\nmethod using solar-powered RFID sensor and DBN is intro-\nduced for incipient hybrid fault diagnosis of transformer. The\nexploited RFID sensor utilizes solar panel to harvest power,\na series of supercapacitors are used as stand-by power to\nimprove the sustainability of power supply. During the day-\ntime, the solar panel harvests solar energy to power the RFID\nsensor and charge the supercapacitors. When the illumination\nintensity is not adequate for the solar panel to harvest enough\npower (>2.8V output voltage) for the RFID sensor (such\nas during the night), the supercapacitor starts to operates as\npower supply.\nThe DBN model is aimed to obtain succinct and dis-\ncriminative features from transformer vibration signals that\ncontains miscellaneous noises and abundant harmonic com-\nponents. The Hilbert envelop spectrum is employed as the\ninput data of DBN, which promises reliable feature extraction\nperformance as well as fault diagnosis performance. The\nhidden layer structure and learning rate of DBN is optimized\nby QPSO approach to guarantee optimal feature extraction\nresults. The experimental results have validated the effec-\ntiveness of the proposed approach in learning features from\nhybrid fault signals, the proposed method can achieve 99.8%\nfault diagnosis accuracy for the incipient fault.\nIn the future, the study would focus on the improvement\nof the RFID sensor and the realization of wireless monitoring\nsystem for the whole substation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
