An interesting aspect of space processing is the existence of multiple space\nrepresentations depending on the extent to which an action can be performed on them [1,2,3].\nIn particular, near/reachable and far/unreachable spaces have been defined as the space inside\nand outside the arm’s reach distance [4].\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175 December 30, 2015 1/1 3\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Anelli F, Candini M, Cappelletti M, Oliveri M,\nFrassinetti F (2015) The Remapping of Time by\nActive Tool-Use.

No grant number is available. The\nfunders had no role in study design, data collection\nand analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of\nthe manuscript.\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nBehaviourally, a dissociation between far and near space has been reported in healthy adults.\nDuring line bisection and landmark tasks, participants typically show a leftward bias (pseudo-\nneglect) in near space that gradually shifts rightward as the stimulus line is moved further away\n[5,6,7].\nAnatomically, animal studies supported the far/near space dissociation indicating that the\nfrontal eye field and the lateral inferior parietal regions are the neural substrate for the far\nspace representation, whereas the rostral part of the inferior parietal lobe and the ventral intra\nparietal regions support the near space representation [3]. In humans, several studies support\nthis functional dichotomy showing that a more dorsal component, such as right parietal\nregions, is involved in near space processing, whereas a more ventral stream component, such\nas right ventral occipital areas, is involved in far space processing [8,9,10].\nInterestingly, space representation is dynamic and the boundary between near and far space\ncan be flexible; for instance, near space can be extended by performing goal-directed move-\nments through the use of a tool, therefore making far space closer (for evidence in monkeys,\nsee 4). In healthy adults, the dynamic properties of space representation have been supported\nby the observation that a tool-use training can impact on the representation of our own reach-\ning space [2,11,12,13,14]. Moreover, the effects of tool-use support the functional distinction\nbetween ‘working’ space (i.e., the near space representation involved in goal-directed action)\nand ‘protective/defensive’ space (i.e., the near space representation involved in the protection\nof the body) [15]. According to this distinction, tool-use selectively alters the size of the work-\ning space.\nTaken together, these data indicate that tool-use can influence the computation of space by\nextending near space to include the space accessible by a tool (far space). Thus, the definition\nof near and far space may depend upon action potentiality [16].\nSpace is not only multidimensional, but it is also known for interacting with other dimen-\nsions of magnitude, for instance time [17,18]. A growing literature often grouped within the\n‘Conceptual Metaphor Theory’ documented the cross-domain link between space and time,\npositing that we understand abstract concepts (such as time) by mapping them onto more con-\ncrete ones (such as space) [19,20,21,22,23,24]. Indeed, it has been shown that we use a spatial\nmap to represent time [25,26]. For example, in a duration judgment task of lateralized visual\nstimuli, healthy subjects overestimate durations in the right space and underestimate durations\nin the left space [27]. Moreover, judgments are faster for short temporal durations in the left\nspace and long temporal durations in the right space [28], which suggests that time is encoded\nwith an ascending left-to-right spatial order (Mental Time Line, MTL) (for a review, [18]).\nHere, we considered the near/far dichotomy to study the interaction between space and\ntime. More specifically, we investigated whether time can be influenced by a reachable/near\nand unreachable/far dimension of space, and whether time processing can be modulated by\ntool-use training. To address these questions, we tested young healthy participants in a time\nbisection task requiring to reproduce half of the duration of visual stimuli presented in near\nand far space. To adjust stimulus’ size for visual angle, a bigger stimulus was presented in far\nrelative to near space. Thus, to exclude that a difference between near and far could be due to\nstimulus\n’ size rather than to a difference in space, small and big stimuli were presented in the\ntwo spaces. We reasoned that if near and far spaces are encoded on the basis of action potenti-\nality, and if actions in space are not only based on spatial but also on temporal coordinates,\nthen a different bias may be expected depending on the portion of space where the temporal\nstimulus is presented. In line with the literature on space perception [6,7], we predicted that a\nleftward bias in near space and a rightward bias in far space may be observed in our temporal\ntask, for both small and big stimuli.\nTime Remapping in Space\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175 December 30, 2015 2/1 3\nSecondly, we examined whether an active tool-training (i.e., a training during which partici-\npants performed goal-directed actions) may lead to time remapping, similar to what has been\nshown for space [2,11,12,13,14]. If time estimation can be modulated by action, then a time\nremapping in far space may be observed; thus stimuli duration in far and near space may be\nperceived as the same following tool-training.\nExperiment 1: Active Tool-Training in Far Space\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Twenty-two right-handed undergraduate students from the University\nof Bologna provided written consent to participate in the experiment (6 males, mean age±sd:\n24±2.24 years, age range: 20– 27). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision,\nno history of neurological or psychiatric diseases. All were naive as to the purpose of the study\nand were debriefed about the experimental aims at the end of the experiment.\nEthics statement. All the experiments reported were carried out in accordance with the\n2008 Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of\nBologna.\nApparatus, stimuli, and procedure.Time perception was investigated with a time bisec-\ntion task previously successfully used in healthy and neuropsychological patients [29,30,31,32].\nParticipants sat in front of a 15-inch color monitor, aligned with the subject's vertical midline\nat eye-level, with their dominant hand on the mouse. E-Prime 2.0 software was used for stimu-\nlus presentation and response collection.\nThe experiment consisted of two phases. In the time encoding phase, a blue square was dis-\nplayed on a black background for one of the following durations: 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200 or\n2400 ms. In the time bisection phase, following a 500 ms-ISI a red square appeared on the\nmonitor in the same position of the blue one; participants reproduced with a button press half\nof the duration of the blue square (Fig 1). No feedback was given. Inter-trial timing was fixed at\n2000 ms.\nThe experiment consisted of three consecutive sessions, each separated by a 5-min interval.\nThe whole experiment lasted about 50 minutes. During the first and third session, participants\nperformed a time bisection task, whereas in the second session they performed a tool-use\ntraining.\nDuring the first and third session, each participant performed the time bisection task in two\nspatial positions (near and far space) and repeated it twice, before (pre-training session) and\nafter tool-use training (post-training session), for a total of four conditions. The order of the\ntwo spatial positions within the first session was counterbalanced across participants, and kept\nconstant within participants during the post-training session.\nIn the Near space condition, participants seated at a distance of 60 cm from the monitor, in\nthe Far space condition they were 120 cm away. Both distances refer to the eyes-to-screen dis-\ntance and were measured by the experimenter through a metal tape measure. The computer\nmonitor was moved at two different distances along a table, in order to maintain the same posi-\ntion for both screen and plane of response. Response device was kept in the same position in\nboth spaces. Stimuli were squares centrally displayed on the monitor. Stimulus’ size was\nadjusted for visual angle. To exclude spurius effects due to different stimulus sizes presented in\nnear and far space, two sizes were used: small square stimuli, corresponding to 1cm x 1cm in\nNear space (0.95 degrees of visual angle), and 2cm x 2cm in Far space (0.95 degrees of visual\nangle). Big square stimuli were 2cm x 2cm in Near space (1.91 degrees of visual angle), and\n4cm x 4cm in Far space (1.91 degrees of visual angle). Small and big square stimuli were ran-\ndomly presented.\nTime Remapping in Space\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175 December 30, 2015 3/1 3\nFor each testing session (pre- and post-training) there were 120 randomly presented trials,\n60 in near and 60 in far space (12 trials for each of the 5 intervals), for a total of 240 trials.\nBefore each pre-training session, subjects performed a practice session, with twenty 2000 ms-\nsquare, where the stimulus sizes were randomized. Participants were instructed to maintain a\nFig 1. Stimuli used in the temporal bisection task.(a) Temporal structure of a representative trial.

This consisted of reaching small objects (i.e., fiches and caps of differ-\nent colors) placed on the table in far space, at a distance of 120 cm from the participant, hold-\ning a rake (tool) with their right hand, namely the same hand used to execute the time\nbisection task. Small objects were randomly presented in the participants’ midsagittal axis (0°),\nor at 10° and 20° to the left and to the right of the central position (-10°, -20°, +10°, +20°). Each\nparticipant performed about a total of 90 reaching movements in order to bring the objects\nclose to the body with no time constraint. The tool used during the training was a 70 cm long\nplastic rake, composed of an ergonomic handle, a shaft, and a final part consisting of seven\nteeth (each 5 cm height) useful to grasp and bring objects, with a total weight of 120 grams.\nResults and Discussion\nThe means of reproduced temporal durations (ms) were entered into a repeated-measures\nANOVA withSession (pre- and post-training),Space (near and far),Dimension (small and\nbig), andInterval (1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, and 2400 ms) as within-subjects factors. Post-hoc\ntests Newman-Keuls corrected for multiple comparisons were performed on significant effects\nand the magnitude of effect size was expressed byη\n2\np.\nThe main effect ofSpace was significant [F(1,21) = 15.56,η2\np = .43, p< .001], because par-\nticipants showed a rightward deviation when they bisected temporal intervals in far (1005 ms)\ncompared with near space (966 ms).Interval was also significant [F(4,84) = 112.47,η2\np = .84,\np < .001], because all intervals differed significantly from each other (veridical durations: 1600,\n1800, 2000, 2200, 2400 ms; estimated half durations: 811, 903, 982, 1073, 1158 ms, respectively;\npost-hoc tests p< .001 for all comparisons), (Fig 2). Importantly, the interaction betweenSes-\nsion and Space was also significant [F(1,21) = 9.76,η2\np = .32, p< .01], because in the pre-train-\ning session participants showed a significant leftward bias when they bisected temporal\nintervals in near (964 ms) compared to far condition (1031 ms, p< .001). By contrast, no dif-\nference between near and far condition was observed in temporal bisection after tool-training\n(968 vs. 980 ms, respectively, p = .35). Crucially to our aim, when pre- and post-training ses-\nsions were directly compared, far conditions significantly differed from each other (p< .001),\nwhereas near conditions did not (p = .75). However, no significant differences emerged\nbetween near space in the pre-training session and far space in the post-training session\n(p = .42), (Fig 3A). There were no other significant effects or interactions (all ps>.11).\nExperiment 1 shows that a specific bias in temporal processing depends on the spatial loca-\ntion where the temporal stimulus was presented. In particular, we found a leftward bias in near\nspace and a rightward bias in far space, a dissociation that supports the existence of action-\ndriven multiple time representations.\nSecond, we report a remapping of time following an active tool-use training. Indeed, after\ntool-training, temporal stimuli presented in far space were processed as if those occurred in\nnear space. This effect suggests that time perception can be modulated by an active tool-use\nwhich depended on whether an action was possible in space. Thus stimuli in far space, which\nwas previously unreachable, are now reachable in near space. Our results complement previous\ndata on tool-use effect on space remapping (e.g., [2,4]), demonstrating that time remapping\ncan occour following an active tool-use which extends action potentiality.\nAlthough the tool allowed participants to reach and retrieve objects placed in a far space\n(i.e., at a distance of 120 cm from participants), it is yet unclear whether the mere passive hold-\ning of a tool (i.e., a passive tool-training), rather than the action performed, may have induced\nTime Remapping in Space\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175 December 30, 2015 5/1 3\ntime remapping. To address this issue, we conducted a control study (Experiment 2) requiring\nparticipants to perform a passive tool-training instead of an active one. We reasoned that if, as\nwe advanced, time remapping is action-dependent, then a time remapping in far space should\nnot be observed following a passive tool-training.\nExperiment 2: Passive Tool-Training in Far Space\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Fifteen new right-handed young adults (4 males, mean age±sd: 24±2.62\nyears, age range: 20– 29) from the same pool as in Experiment 1 were recruited.\nApparatus, stimuli, and procedure.The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were the same\nas outlined in Experiment 1, except for the following differences. First, only small stimuli were\nused corresponding to 1cm x 1cm in Near space (0.95 degrees of visual angle) and 2cm x 2cm\nin Far space (0.95 degrees of visual angle). This is because in Experiment 1 no difference was\nfound between the two different stimulus sizes (i.e., small and big). Thus, for each testing ses-\nsion (pre- and post-training) there were 60 randomly presented trials, 30 in near and 30 in far\nspace (12 trials for each of the 5 intervals), for a total of 120 trials.\nFig 2.Interval effect. Values are in ms and error bars depicted SEM. Asterisks indicate significant differences (p< .05).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175.g002\nTime Remapping in Space\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175 December 30, 2015 6/1 3\nSecond, the training performed between the two experimental sessions was also different.\nParticipants sat at the table and held the same tool used in Experiment 1 with their right hand\nfor the whole training session (15-minutes). The experimenter randomly placed small objects\n(i.e., fiches and caps of different colors) on the table near the tip of the tool at the same loca-\ntions as in the Experiment 1 (i.e., at a distance of 120 cm). Participants carefully observed the\nobjects’ position but did not perform any movement to reach the objects. In order to maintain\na constant level of attention during the training and to ensure that their attention was directed\ntoward the tip of the tool throughout the whole training, participants were occasionally asked\nto verbally report the color and the spatial position of the object presented. Hence, participants\nperformed a training which did not require the active use of the tool.\nResults and Discussion\nThe means of reproduced temporal durations (ms) were entered into a repeated-measures\nANOVA withSession (pre- and post-training),Space (near and far), andInterval (1600, 1800,\n2000, 2200, and 2400 ms) as within-subjects factors. Post-hoc tests Newman-Keuls corrected\nfor multiple comparisons were performed on significant effects and the magnitude of effect\nsize was expressed byη2\np.\nFig 3.Space x Session interaction in the four experiments (Experiments 1–4 in panels a-d respectively).Values are in ms and error bars depicted\nSEM. Asterisks indicate significant differences (p< .05). Note thatSpace x Session interaction is not significant in Experiments 2– 4, thus asterisks are not\nreported.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175.g003\nTime Remapping in Space\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175 December 30, 2015 7/1 3\nThe main effect ofSpace was significant [F(1,14) = 10.38,η2\np = .43, p< .01], because there\nwas a rightward deviation in bisecting temporal intervals in far (1042 ms) compared with near\nspace (996 ms). Interval was also significant [F(4,56) = 87.06,η2\np = .86, p< .001], because all\nintervals differed significantly from each other (veridical durations: 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200,\n2400 ms; estimated half durations: 846, 943, 1044, 1104, 1156 ms, respectively; post-hoc tests\np < .01 for all comparisons).Session (η\n2\np = .18, p = .09) and, crucially, its interaction with\nSpace (η2\np = .04, p = .49) were not significant (Fig 3B).\nExperiment 2 showed a leftward bias in near space and a rightward bias in far space, thus\nreplicating the near/far dissociation in temporal processing found in Experiment 1. Crucially,\nno remappig of time was found following a passive tool-training, such that the near/far dissoci-\nation was still present after tool-training. This evidence clearly shows that time remapping is\naction-dependent and does not occur following a passive tool-use, namely while holding a tool\nwithout performing an action.\nAlthough data from Experiments 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate the action-dependence of the\ntool-use effect, it may yet be possible that time remapping occurs regardless of the specific\neffector used during the training. To address this question, we conducted another control\nstudy (Experiment 3) requiring participants to perform an active tool-training. Using the same\nprocedure described in Experiment 1, participants held the tool with the left hand, namely the\nopposed hand to that used to execute the time bisection task, instead of the right hand, as they\ndid in Experiment 1. Based on the view that tool-training specifically induces a transient\nexpansion of the space around the used effector [4,33,34], we therefore predicted that time\nremapping may be effector-dependent, and that no effect may be observed after a training with\nthe left hand.\nExperiment 3: Active Tool-Training in Far Space with Left Hand\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Fifteen new right-handed young adults (5 males, mean age±sd: 23±3.85\nyears, age range: 18– 30) from the same pool as in Experiment 1 were recruited.\nApparatus, stimuli, and procedure.The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were the same\nas outlined in Experiment 2, the only difference being the training. Participants sat at the table\nand performed the same 15-minutes active tool-use training described in Esperiment 1, but\nthey were required to use the tool with their left instead of the right hand. Hence, while partici-\npants were instructed to respond with their right hand during the temporal bisection task, they\nused the left hand during the active tool-use training.\nResults and Discussion\nHere we performed the same analysis described in Experiment 2. The main effect ofSpace\nwas significant [F(1,14) = 5.36,η2\np = .28, p< .05], because participants showed a rightward\ndeviation when they bisected temporal intervals in far (1037 ms) compared with near space\n(994 ms).Interval was also significant [F(4,56) = 63.54,η2\np = .82, p< .001], because all inter-\nvals differed significantly from each other (veridical durations: 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200, 2400\nms; estimated half durations: 832, 930, 1033, 1108, 1175 ms, respectively; post-hoc tests p< .01\nfor all comparisons).Session (η\n2\np = .00, p = .82) and, crucially, its interaction withSpace\n(η2\np = .03, p = .53) were not significant (Fig 3C).\nThese results replicated the dissociation found in Experiments 1 and 2 between time pro-\ncessing in near and far space. Moreover, this dissociation was present both pre- and post-train-\ning showing that an active tool-use training is not sufficient to induce a remapping of time if\nTime Remapping in Space\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175 December 30, 2015 8/1 3\nexecuted with a different effector from that used to perform the temporal task (i.e., left vs. right\nhand). This therefore suggests that tool-use effects on time processing are effector-dependent.\nAlthough so far we demonstrated both the action-dependence and the effector-dependence\nof the tool-use effect for time remapping, it may be possible that this remapping occurs follow-\ning any action, regardless of the instrument or effector used. To test this possibility, a final con-\ntrol study (Experiment 4) was carried out, whereby participants interacted with objects\npresented in near space using their right hand instead of the tool. We reasoned that if time\nremapping is strictly tool-based, then there should be no time remapping in far space following\nthe hand-training.\nExperiment 4: Active Hand-Training in Near Space\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants. Fifteen new right-handed young adults (4 males, mean age±sd: 25±1.88\nyears, age range: 22– 29) from the same pool as in Experiment 1 were recruited.\nApparatus, stimuli, and procedure.The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were the same\nas outlined in Experiment 2, the only difference being the training. Participants sat at the table\nand performed a 15-minutes active training which consisted of reaching small objects using\ntheir own right hand instead of the tool, for the whole training session. The experimenter\nplaced the same small objects used in previous experiments on the table, at a distance of 60 cm\nfrom the participants in the near space. Participants were asked to reach the objects and to\nbring them close to their body with a single hand movement. Hence, participants performed a\ntraining in the near space which did not require the use of the tool.\nResults and Discussion\nHere we performed the same analysis reported in Experiments 2 and 3. The main effect of\nSpace was significant [F(1,14) = 5.97,η2\np = .30, p< .05], because participants showed a right-\nward deviation when they bisected temporal intervals in far (1049 ms) compared with near\nspace (998 ms).Interval was also significant [F(4,56) = 57.91,η\n2\np = .81, p< .001], because all\nintervals differed significantly from each other (veridical durations: 1600, 1800, 2000, 2200,\n2400 ms; estimated half durations: 841, 938, 1037, 1124, 1181 ms, respectively; post-hoc tests\np < .05 for all comparisons).Session (η\n2\np = .02, p = .56) and, crucially, its interaction with\nSpace (η2\np = .04, p = .47) were not significant (Fig 3D).\nThese results replicated the dissociation between time processing in near and far space\nshown in Experiments 1, 2, and 3. This dissociation was present both pre-and post-training\nshowing that merely performing actions with a hand rather than a tool was not sufficient to\ninduce a remapping of time.\nGeneral Discussion\nThis study explored whether time processing mirrors the multi-dimensional organization of\nspace, and whether it can be equally modulated by a training, actively or passively executed\nwith a tool or actively executed with hand. The existence of multiple representations of space is\nnow well established [1,35], as well as the effects of tool-use on the boundaries between differ-\nent spatial representations, which reflects the flexibility of space reachability [4]. Space is also\nknown for interacting with time processing, suggesting a robust link between these dimensions\n[18], but whether time is also multi-dimensional and can be modulated by tool-use is not yet\nknown.\nTime Remapping in Space\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175 December 30, 2015 9/1 3\nUsing an established time bisection paradigm [29,30,31,32], we first investigated whether\ntime may be influenced by action potentiality in space. We found a dissociation between time\nin near/reachable space and far/unreachable space, indicating that multiple time representa-\ntions exist. This is in line with multiple space representations revealed in performing line bisec-\ntion and landmark tasks [1,6,7,35], whereby healthy adults show a left-to-right shift with\nincreasing distance [6].\nTo our knowledge, one study has so far investigated time processing of imaginary objects\nlocated in either near/far representational space [36]. Participants were required to estimate\nthe duration of an imagined analog clockface in two conditions. In near condition the clock\nhad to fill the full imagery field; in the far condition the clock had to be imagined from a dis-\ntance of about 6 metres. The duration estimation was shorter in far than in near space. How-\never, since in the far condition the imagined stimulus was veridically smaller than in the near\ncondition, this leaves open the possibility that participants may have processed the relationship\nbetween size and time, rather than space and time. Instead our results cannot be explained by\nan effect of stimulus’ size because we have adjusted the stimuli dimension in the near and far\nspace. This manipulation, as well as the lack of a significantDimension effect in the analyses,\nmakes it less likely that our dissociation of near/far time could simply be explained by different\nstimuli size presented in near and far space.\nNext, we examined whether an active tool-training compared to a passive tool-training and\nto an active hand-training may lead to a remapping of temporal duration, similar to what\nobserved in the spatial domain [1,37]. We found that only following an active tool-use training\n(Experiment 1), participants were able to remap time in far space similar to what already found\nin space, whereby training typically makes stimuli in far space reachable in near space. Indeed,\nfollowing an active tool-training temporal judgments did not differ in far and near space. Con-\nversely, following both a passive tool-training (Experiment 2) and an active hand-training\n(Experiment 4) a remapping of time in far space did not occur. Remarkably, remapping was\nnot observed even when a different hand was used during the active tool-use training and the\ntemporal bisection task (i.e., left and right hand, respectively; Experiment 3).\nThese results suggest that tool-use training modifies and spatially extends our action poten-\ntiality, leading to a different coding of time on the basis of action potentiality in space. Indeed,\ntime remapping proved to be action-dependent, since the extension of action potentiality spe-\ncifically occured following the active tool-use rather than simply holding a tool. At the notion\nthat tool-use modifies the working space [15], here we also highlight the temporal component\nof space. Recent evidence provided further support to the link between time perception and\naction potentiality. For instance, temporal judgments are more accurate and precise for visual\nstimuli moving accordingly to the human motor repertoire rather than non-biological kine-\nmatics, suggesting that observer’s motor knowledge implicitly affects time perception [38].\nDifferent reasons may explain the effect of tool-training. One is in terms of a general atten-\ntional mechanism, such that using a tool may lead to a shift of spatial attention from the effec-\ntor towards the side of space where the tip of the tool is located, that is the space made\nreachable during the tool-training (e.g., [39,40]; for a review, [41]). In this case, the tool train-\ning may enhance the salience of visual stimuli presented in the far space, a possibility that was\nexcluded in Experiment 2 whereby participants passively held the tool and reported some\ninformation about the objects presented at the tip of the tool. This requirement may have\ninduced participants to shift their attention toward far space during the passive tool-training in\norder to correctly report the required information, as also shown in other recent studies\n[42,43]. Here, passive tool-use training resulted in no remapping, therefore excluding that gen-\neral attentional mechanism fully explained time remapping.\nTime Remapping in Space\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0146175 December 30, 2015 10 / 13\nA second interpretation of the tool-based time remapping has to be considered, assuming a\nchange in theperception of external visual space, based on the action-specific perception view.\nThis claims that perception derives from the relation between the external environment and\nthe ability to act within it [44]. Indeed, spatial targets are perceived closer than veridical when\nthey are within reach of a tool rather than the hands, suggesting that space perception is influ-\nenced by intended actions ([14,45]; but see [46]). This alteration of perceived distance emerged\nonly when coupled with the perceiver’s intention to act, and it is not observed when partici-\npants passively hold a tool [4,47]. Our results only partially support this interpretation since we\nfound that time remapping is strictly dependent on the effector trained, and it does not emerge\nwhen participants used a different hand to perform the tool-use training and the temporal\nbisection task (Experiment 3).\nA final explanation of the tool-use effect is in terms of a change in the Body Schema, namely\nthe body representation used to plan and to execute an action. This suggests that following train-\ning, a temporary tool-embodiment would occur, such that the tool becomes part of the body\n(e.g., [1,12,13]; for a review, [34]). This is supported by the observation of changes in the kine-\nmatic parameters of arm movements after tool-training [2,11]. These kinematics changes would\nreflect somatosensory modifications in the Body Schema, as if participants performed the move-\nments with a longer arm after tool-use. Similarly, tool-use induced a shift in the perceived mid-\npoint of participants’ own forearm distally with respect to the pre-tool midpoint, in line with an\nincreased internal representation of the arm length [42]. Hence, tool-embodiment affects not\nonly the kinematic of arm movements, but also sensory body representation\n[2,11,42,43,48,49,50,51]. Our results are fully compatible with the tool-embodiment hypothesis\nsince it accounts for the action-dependence of the time remapping effect (Experiments 1 and 2),\nas well as its effector-dependence (Experiment 3). Indeed, an increased internal representation of\nthe arm length which was specific for the arm trained, explains why no time remapping was\nobserved when tool-training and temporal bisection were executed with two different hands.\nIn conclusion, the current study demonstrates that action influences time perception,\nresembling the effect that action has on space and providing the first evidence for the flexible\nnature of time representation, whose boundaries can be dynamically modulated by active tool-\nuse. Given the well-known effect of tool in the spatial domain, it is difficult to disambiguate\nwhether tool-use changes time processing by modifying spatial features, or whether tool-use\ndirectly impacts on time processing without the mediation of space. We speculate that at least\nin our paradigm, the observed remapping may act on space and time, since these representa-\ntions are mutually related and both coordinates contributed to action [29,52].\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Andrea Dainesi and Laura Guasti for their help in collecting data, and two anony-\nmous reviewers for their useful comments on an early version of the paper.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: FA M.
