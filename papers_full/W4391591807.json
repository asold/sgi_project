ACM, New York, NY, USA, 23 pages.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642647\n1 INTRODUCTION\nMathematics is a fundamental building block in children’s early edu-\ncation and is a strong predictor of their future achievements [14, 20,\n71, 82, 86]. Particularly in early childhood, mathematical learning\nis not just about learning to count or calculate; it also emphasizes\nthe ability to understand and apply mathematical language, such as\n“half” or “equal”. Children often learn these words through everyday\nconversations with others [89]. For instance, when a parent asks,\n“Do you have more cookies than me?” children are introducing the\nquantitative term “more. ” However, studies have found that the\namount and quality of math language children encounter through\nthese everyday, spontaneous conversations can vary greatly, which\noften aligns with socioeconomic differences [ 17]. This variation\nmay have translated into disparities in early math abilities [25].\nTo enrich children’s experience of math language beyond every-\nday conversations, researchers have emphasized the importance of\nincluding a language component in general mathematics instruc-\ntion, which allows children to engage with math language more\nsystematically. However, it is challenging to teach math language\nabstractly to young children [60]. One of the approaches widely\nused with preschoolers and early elementary school children is\nto embed math language within the context of narrative stories ,\nmaking abstract language more tangible and engaging for young\nlearners [37, 76]. Typically, this story-based learning approach in-\nvolves encouraging children to engage in dialogues within a story-\nline, where they understand and practice math terms with guidance\nfrom a more knowledgeable individual, such as a parent, teacher,\nor older peer [13, 21, 37, 65, 76]. Yet, the practicality of teaching\nmath language through joint storytelling is debatable, as it demands\na one-on-one engaged storytelling session that is logistically in-\nfeasible given the limited resources most educational institutions\nface [75–77].\nIn response to this challenge, researchers have long been inves-\ntigating AI’s potential to simulate human-like storytelling inter-\nactions [16, 55, 69, 69, 84, 105]. However, before the emergence\nof Large Language Models (LLMs), AI was primarily optimized\nfor structured interactions with children, such as asking questions\nand providing evaluative feedback [79, 102]. It is with the recent\nadvancements in LLMs, notably GPT-4 [68], that the technical dif-\nficulty of facilitating spontaneous and creative conversations has\nstarted to see promising developments [51]. However, the feasibility\nand efficacy of utilizing LLMs as partners to engage with children in\nstorytelling remains unclear, especially in the context of supporting\nthe learning of math language. Moreover, from a design perspective,\nit is unclear what specific workflow is necessary to tailor LLMs’\ncapacities to a younger audience [93].\nThis study outlines the development process for creating Math-\nemyths, a novel co-creative storytelling system powered by a GPT-\nbased conversational agent, with the goal of teaching math language\nto children (Fig. 1). We then present empirical findings from a user\nstudy comparing learning and engagement outcomes using Math-\nemyths to those of a comparable human-guided interaction. Specif-\nically, we aim to answer the following three research questions:\nRQ1 How can prompt engineering be employed to optimize LLMs as\nstory co-creators tailored for children’s educational purposes?\nRQ2 Do interactions with LLMs effectively engage children and pro-\nvide an enjoyable experience during the co-creation of stories?\nRQ3 Can children’s such interactions with LLMs result in com-\nparable learning outcomes seen in human-child storytelling\ninteractions?\nOur results indicate that when children interacted with Math-\nemyths, their learning of mathematical language appeared to be\ncomparable to those who co-created stories with a human partner.\nHowever, while both younger and older children benefited from\ninteracting with Mathemyths, we observed differences in the ways\nchildren from different age groups engage with co-creation partners\nof different natures. Overall, we believe that LLM applications, such\nas Mathemyths, can offer children a unique conversational experi-\nence, complementing their interactions with others. Our findings\nhave implications for the design of LLM-based applications aimed\nat supporting children’s learning. Additionally, they highlight areas\nrequiring further consideration to ensure the technology is both\nsupportive and effective for diverse learning experiences.\n2 RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we review research on (1) teaching math language\nthrough storytelling, (2) conversational interfaces for children, and\n(3) using LLMs for child-facing conversational interfaces.\n2.1 Teaching Math Language through\nStorytelling\nChildren’s mathematical abilities are significantly influenced by\ntheir language skills [65, 71, 87, 96, 97, 100, 111]. Indeed, the Com-\nmon Core State Standards, a US educational framework, highlight\nthe need for students to be able to understand and apply specific\nmathematical language to describe the math concepts [3]. For in-\nstance, by second grade, students are expected to b e familiar with\nterminology associated with fundamental math operations: addi-\ntion, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Nevertheless, while\nsome of this math language can be replaced by informal, everyday\nexpressions (e.g., “putting together” as opposed to “addition”) to\nconvey a similar meaning, equipping students with precise math\nterminologies is still necessary. Such terminology serves as a bridge\nto help children transition from their concrete everyday way of\nthinking to more abstract analytical thinking.\nMathemyths CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nChildren engage in math language in different ways, including\ntheir daily dialogues with teachers and parents [89]. Research has\nindicated a positive correlation between the extent and frequency of\nmath language used by parents or teachers and the development of\nchildren’s math abilities at the onset of elementary education [77].\nHowever, the extent of math talk to which children are exposed\nvaries significantly, likely influenced by the differing levels of aware-\nness, expertise, or comfort among parents and teachers [ 17, 26].\nThis variation is recognized as a contributing factor to the dispari-\nties observed in children’s math abilities [25]. Furthermore, while\nearlier studies predominantly focused on math language produced\nby parents and teachers, with children as recipients, more recent\nresearch has broadened this perspective. It emphasizes the opportu-\nnities for children to not only be exposed to but also generate math\ntalk themselves [2, 83]. Interestingly, these studies have revealed\nthat the children’s own mathematical conversations play a crucial,\nif not more significant, role in shaping their mathematical compe-\ntence, sometimes even outweighing the influence of the math talk\nprovided by parents or teachers [90, 98].\nTo address the varying degrees of math talk children encounter\nin spontaneous circumstances and to encourage their active en-\ngagement in math discussions, researchers have developed various\ninterventions. These interventions often utilize a storytelling ap-\nproach [32, 36, 41, 46, 73], where children, along with their parents\nor teachers, engage in math-themed narratives. Discussion prompts\nare provided within these narratives to encourage children to use\nmath language. For example, Purpura et al. [76] devised an eight-\nweek intervention in Head Start classrooms, targeting children\naged three to five. Researchers read six storybooks containing math\nvocabulary (e.g., “fewer”) to the children. During the readings, re-\nsearchers asked children questions that expanded upon the book’s\nexisting math language (e.g., ’How do we know there were a lot and\nnot just a few?’). Additionally, if a child expressed confusion about\na math term, the researchers explicitly defined and explained it. The\nresearchers found that children who participated in the interven-\ntion significantly outperformed those in a comparison group, who\ncontinued with business as usual, not only in a math language as-\nsessment but also in a math knowledge assessment. Another study\nused a similar story-based approach among kindergarten children\nwith numeracy difficulties [36]. This study found that the students\nwho engaged in the stories and related dialogue learned math vocab-\nulary better than the other group of students who received direct\ninstruction of the math vocabulary.\nTraditionally, many story-based approaches have incorporated\ndialogue into existing narratives, thus, to some extent, constraining\nchildren’s creative involvement in shaping the stories. Thus, the\nresearch community has also been promoting an approach that\nencourages children to contribute and decide how they want the\nnarrative storyline to progress, which is believed to empower chil-\ndren to bring their lived experiences to the dialogue to support\ntheir meaning making [66]. This type of child-led storytelling has\nbeen adopted in preschool and early elementary classrooms and\nhas proven to be feasible and age-appropriate. For instance, Flynn’s\nstudy focused on a small group of four- to five-year-old children\nwho were co-creating stories alongside an adult facilitator [28]. The\nresearch suggested that these children were able to meaningfully\nadvance the story plot, drawing inspiration from ideas contributed\nby their peers. It should be noted that, facilitation from an adult is\nimportant for children to fully engage in this process. In particular,\nthe study highlighted the facilitator’s role in posing questions to\nguide children’s responses and offer constructive feedback respon-\nsive to children’s contributions. Such question-feedback-scaffolding\ncould potentially lower the cognitive demand required for certain\nchallenges children face when continuing the story [ 102]. Build-\ning on this concept, the HCI community has long been exploring\ntechnology-mediated platforms to support children storytelling.\nWe will discuss this line of prior research in detail in the section\nbelow.\n2.2 Conversational Interfaces for Children\nWith the rapid advancement of AI, conversational user interfaces\n(CUIs) can now simulate interpersonal interactions through natu-\nral spoken language with children [72]. This type of speech-based\ninteraction may not require children to have reading and typing\nskills, as is the case with other graphical user interfaces, thus re-\nmoving the barrier for children who have not yet fully developed\ntheir literacy skills. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for a screen,\npotentially reducing tensions between children and their parents\nregarding screen time[39, 52]. Previous research has identified two\nprevalent types of interactions that children tend to have with\nCUIs [101]: voice assistants supporting open-domain conversations\n(e.g., Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant) and voice-based\napps that specifically designed for children for domain-specific con-\nversations [8, 9, 56, 62, 63]. This type of specifically design apps\nhave been found to support children’s learning across a number of\ndisciplines, including math [40, 98], science [102], computational\nthinking [18], and literacy [101]. Though varied in their specific\ndesign, these applications are grounded in a common principle by\nutilizing conversational AI as a language partner to engage children\nin discussions related to the relevant topics.\nFor instance, Ho and colleagues developed a social robot that\nprovides math-related prompts in storybooks for parents of four-\nand five-year-olds, covering concepts like subtraction, addition, and\ncomparisons [40]. The study revealed that parents found the robot’s\nquestions inspiring and that these questions led to more meaningful\nconversations with their children. Another example is a voice-based\ngame designed to teach children aged four to seven [ 98]. In this\ngame, children interacted with visual representations of shapes\nin different colors and sizes, receiving prompts such as “turn the\ntallest triangle into a circle. ” The game also featured back-and-forth\nquestions to guide children through this process. A user study in-\nvolving 18 children demonstrated that this game helped them learn\nthe target math terms and engage in verbal reasoning about their\ndecisions. Although these two studies utilized either the Wizard-of-\nOz approach or pre-scripted dialogues, they provided insights and\nevidence of feasibility in terms of how CUIs could be designed to\nsupport math talk among preschool and early elementary-aged chil-\ndren. These insights have paved the way for our current research,\nwhich seeks to enable free-flowing, story-based interactions for\nchildren in the context of math dialogues.\nAnother related research area is focused CUI and storytelling\nspecifically, where an agent collaboratively co-creates stories with\nchildren [97, 100, 103, 108, 109], mirroring the common childhood\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Chao Zhang et al.\nactivity children have with teachers or parents. Among these stud-\nies, a prevailing model involves the agent listening to a child’s\nstories and then periodically offering generic, template-based re-\nsponse that are not usually responsive to children’s specific con-\ntribution [10, 80, 94]. For instance, Bers and colleague developed\na plush rabbit that reacts to a child’s storytelling by moving its\nears and shaking its body [11]. When the child pauses, the rabbit\nthen prompts them with scripted follow-up questions to encourage\nfurther storytelling contributions [10]. This interactive strategy has\nbeen utilized in more recent studies as well [42].\nWhile these studies have found that even this limited and struc-\ntured interactivity can support children’s storytelling, the agent\nmade in fact minimal contributions to children’s stories. Xu and col-\nleagues referred to this type of interaction as “pseudo-conversation, ”\nwhere the agent follows predetermined dialogue flows when inter-\nacting with children [101]. This limitation could be especially prob-\nlematic in creative storytelling activities, where children may gen-\nerate a wide range of creative responses. Nevertheless, to overcome\nthe technological limitations at the time, many studies employed\nWizard-of-Oz approaches to explore the feasibility of children en-\ngaging in joint storytelling with a non-human partner, as perceived\nby the child. For example, Sun et al. [87] had children aged 4 to 10\ninteracted with a robot secretly controlled by a researcher, periodi-\ncally inserting new story content and relating it to the story created\nby the child. Children were found to meaningfully collaborate with\nthe “robot” and enjoy their interactions. These Wizard of Oz stud-\nies suggested that it is possible to replicate the strategies utilized\nby human partners in a setting with other technological partners,\nthereby laying the foundation for our research. With the advances\nin LLM, such human-led interactions can now be more feasibly\nsimulated by AI agents. Thus, a primary objective of our current\nstudy is to utilize LLMs to emulate “true conversation, ” which is\ndefined as multiple parties ’mutually orienting to, and collaborating\nin order to achieve, orderly and meaningful communication’ [27]\n2.3 Using Large Language Models for\nChild-facing Conversational Interfaces\nPre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 [ 12]\nand GPT-4 [68], have significantly advanced natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP) in recent years. These models, trained on colossal\namounts of text data, can generalize to downstream tasks like text\ngeneration [93]. One key capability derived from the large model\nsize is prompting [93], which allows individuals to provide specific\ntextual instructions and examples [106] to guide the model’s task\nexecution. Although prompting LLMs may not consistently sur-\npass benchmark models, it offers a lightweight approach to achieve\ncompetitive performance across a variety of tasks [ 12, 15]. The\nconcept of prompting LLMs remains a compelling research topic\nwithin the HCI community. Our work extends previous research\nby introducing a set of prompting techniques iteratively designed\nto optimize LLMs as story co-creators tailored for children’s edu-\ncational purposes.\nCUIs powered by LLMs, such as ChatGPT [ 67], have demon-\nstrated their potential in facilitating responsive and engaging di-\nalogues. Unlike traditional CUIs, they are not constrained by a\npre-determined dialogue paradigm or reliant on pre-written re-\nsponses. One of their standout features is the ability to generate\ncontextually relevant and coherent responses based on the input\nthey receive so far [93]. This capability positions them to achieve\n“true conversation”, wherein they can effectively collaborate with\nchildren, ensuring a more natural and enriching dialogue [56]. Thus,\nthis paper harnesses the adaptability and flexibility of LLMs, aim-\ning to forge a dynamic and collaborative storytelling experience\nfor children, thereby fostering their math language growth and\nstimulating their creative expression.\nRecently, numerous researchers have endeavored to incorporate\nLLMs into educational technologies [51]. These adaptations have\nseen the utilization of LLMs in creating educational content [19, 29],\nenhancing student engagement and interaction [1, 7, 88], and per-\nsonalizing learning experiences [81]. For instance, LLMs have been\nused to generate children’s narratives [4, 35], some of which have\neven been sold publicly [64]. In a different research trajectory, sev-\neral scholars have used LLMs to create intelligent learning partners\ncapable of collaborating with humans [47], providing feedback [49]\nand encouraging students [ 24, 88]. One common application in-\nvolves employing LLMs as a conversational partner in written or\noral form, such as in the context of task-oriented dialogues that offer\nlanguage practice opportunities [24]. Building on these advance-\nments in LLMs, our work aims to apply LLMs in CUIs to enable child-\nAI collaborative storytelling for mathematical language learning.\n3 THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF\nMATHEMYTHS\nGrounded in the strong evidence that children develop math lan-\nguage through storytelling, and considering the unique capabilities\nof LLMs, we engaged in a design process to conceptualize Math-\nemyths . Our aim was to create a co-creative storytelling system\ntailored for children aged 4-8, introducing them to mathematical\nlanguage through voice-based interactions. This initiative serves\nas a case study to explore the potential of LLMs as educational\npartners for children.\nAt its core, Mathemyths is designed to collaboratively engage\nin storytelling by alternating turns with a child. The role of Math-\nemyths within this dynamic is three-fold: 1) generating prompts to\nelicit narrative contributions from the children, 2) continuing the\nstory by utilizing mathematical language based on the children’s\ninput, and 3) providing scaffolding when children are hesitant to\nengage or show confusions about the prompts or the story. The\ninteraction flow is presented in Fig. 2. The example conversation\nbetween a child and Mathemyths can be found in Appendix A.\nGiven that using LLMs, particularly through prompt engineering,\nto develop educational tools is a relatively new domain, our design\nprocess began by applying educational principles from the existing\nliterature reviewed above, which focus on engaging children in joint\nstorytelling and math talk. We then engaged in a series of exper-\niments to optimize Mathemyths ’s capabilities for child-friendly\nand math-focused dialogue. In the remainder of this section, we\noutline 1) our overall design principles for Mathemyths , 2) our\nmethod to prompt engineer LLM to serve as the story co-creator, 3)\nour process to evaluate the prompt-engineered LLM’s performance,\nand 4) the implementation of the Mathemyths system.\nMathemyths CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nFigure 2: The interaction flow of the Mathemyths system.\n3.1 Design Principles\nDrawing from the literature reviewed above, we incorporated two\nkey design principles into the story co-creation interaction.\nFirst, the conversation experience is designed to emulate a joint\nstorytelling activity while the AI partner guides children in this\nprocess through using three-part dialogue moves that adhere to the\nquestion-feedback-scaffolding framework [102]. Under this frame-\nwork, Mathemyths initiates the interaction with children by craft-\ning an initial story plot based on children’s input about key ele-\nments such as the protagonist and setting. It then poses open-ended\nquestions to solicit how children wish the story should progress,\nsuch as “What will Lucy and Nick do next to make sure they take\nan equal number of steps to reach the treasure? ” After children’s\nresponses, Mathemyths then offers feedback that includes both\nan acknowledgement of children’s contribution (e.g., “Wonderful\nidea! That’s a clever way to find the map. ”) and a continuation\nthe narrative in line with the children’s input. In the cases when\nyoung children require additional support to generate a concrete\nidea, Mathemyths provides scaffolding to encourage children\nto elaborate their ideas [53, 87, 108, 109]. For instance, if the child\nprovides a brief response without much detail, such as “ ask for\nhelp”, the agent will ask a follow-up question, “What a good point!\nWho should we ask for help? Can you tell me more about these help-\nful friends? ” In other cases, if the child indicates confusions (e.g.,\n‘I don’t know ”) or does not respond, Mathemyths will scaffold\nthe child by employing the “hint and rephrase” strategy to pro-\nvide ideas for children to consider (e.g., “Let’s think together. Lucy\nand Nick can take turns counting their steps. How many steps do\nyou think they should both count? ”). This strategy, simplifying the\noriginal open-ended question by suggesting a specific direction, is\nwidely utilized in conversational agents to engage preschool-aged\nchildren [33, 34, 102].\nTo make the storytelling experience more suitable for young chil-\ndren, Mathemyths creates story based on the quest archetype. This\ngenre, prevalent in children’s literature, focuses on a hero’s journey\nto a particular place or to find an item, facing many challenges along\nthe way [44]. Language-wise, Mathemyths is instructed to use\nsimple, clear language that young children can easily understand,\nwith sentences that are straightforward in structure.\nSecond, situated within the narrative structure, Mathemyths is\nalso designed to teach math language through exposure (i.e., using\nmath terms in the plots generated by Mathemyths ) and practice\n(i.e., posing questions to encourage children to use math terms to\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Chao Zhang et al.\ncontinue the stories). Mathemyths primarily focuses on six math-\nematical terms (sum, estimate, add, subtract, equal, and half ). These\nterms and their related concepts align with the kindergarten and\nfirst grade Common Core State Standards [3, 45]. The children in\nthese grades, usually aged between 5 and 7 years, fall in the middle\nof our target age range. We also tested other terms from the Com-\nmon Core Standard, such as “divide” and “multiply”, but ultimately\ndecided not to use those terms as they might be too complex for\nour younger participants. Children heard these terms used at least\ntwice per story. Moreover,Mathemyths is uniquely designed to\nnot only introduce these terms but also provide explanations within\nthe narrative context. For instance, when the term “equal” is used\nin a sentence like, “Lucy and Nick take an equal number of steps, ”\nMathemyths explains it in a story-relevant way: “This means Lucy\nand Nick take the same number of steps. If Lucy takes 5 steps, then\nNick also takes 5 steps. ” These types of explanations, integrated\nwithin the context, are deemed more effective for young children\nthan abstract definitions [18, 32, 102].\n3.2 Prompt Engineering\nThe model underlying Mathemyths was GPT-41, currently the\nmost advanced LLM available for developers. Through prompt en-\ngineering, GPT-4 performed three primary tasks aligned with the\nquestion-feedback-scaffolding model: 1) generating questions to\nfacilitate children’s continuation of the story; 2) continuing the\nstory based on children’s responses, including in-context explana-\ntions of math terms; and 3) providing scaffolding with additional\nsuggestions or follow-up questions, tailored to children’s different\nresponses.\nThe prompts were developed through an iterative process. We\nborrowed Brown et al. [12] suggested prompt engineering strategies\nto draft our initial prompts. We then underwent a two-month-long\nrevision process, which involved internal evaluations with the re-\nsearch team and evaluations with children, and this process led us\nto rapid iterations of the prompts.\nAll these features were implemented using the OpenAI APIs2.\nThe final version of prompts used in the user study is displayed in\nAppendix D Table 4.\n3.2.1 Question Generation. Following a similar prompt structure\nproposed in Brown et al. ’s work [12], each prompt starts with a\npreamble which explains the prompt’s purpose: “Given an unfin-\nished story, compose one single, straightforward question to prompt\na 6-year-old to expand on the story. ” The preamble is followed by\na detailed list of instructions and multiple exemplars consisting\nof the input and the output. Specifically, we directed the model\nto pose questions concerning the main character’s subsequent ac-\ntions or emotions. These two story elements are not only important\nto the narrative’s progression but are also tangible concepts that\nchildren can readily engage with and respond to [70]. To enhance\nGPT-4 performance, we provided six exemplar questions generated\nby the research team. These questions were further reviewed and\napproved by two trained research assistants in the domains of chil-\ndren’s verbal storytelling and mathematics education. The detailed\nprompt templates are shown in Appendix D Table 4.\n1https://openai.com/gpt-4\n2https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat\n3.2.2 Story Continuation. To facilitate the continuation of stories\nbased on children’s inputs, while integrating mathematical lan-\nguage instruction, we began by prompting the model to assume\nthe role of a “storytelling robot 3”. This prompt established the inter-\nactive framework of the LLM’s responses.\nThe next part of the prompt was focused on context-setting.\nWe supplied the model with a narrative scenario: “ Let’s play a\njoint storytelling game where we build a story together with the\nmain character being a [character] named [name] in the [setting]. ”\nThe elements in brackets ([character], [name], [setting]) would\nbe dynamically populated based on the responses provided by the\nchildren. We also set several high level rules to ensure the generated\nstory content “is simple and appropriate for a young child ”, adheres\nto the quest archetype, and contains nothing unrelated to the story.\nFor the model to produce coherent and math-focused responses,\nwe articulated a specific sequence for it to follow. The model was\ntasked with acknowledging children’s contributions, utilizing a\nminimum of two mathematical terms, and then offering in-context\nexplanations. This was achieved via the following detailed prompt:\n“First, acknowledge my addition and commend me in a short 10-word\nsentence. Next, continue the story by correctly using [mathematical\nterm one] and [mathematical term two] or their variants within two\ndistinct short sentences. Lastly, explain their meanings within a short\nsentence, grounding it firmly within the story’s context. ”\nDuring experimentation, we observed the LLM’s tendency to\noccasionally overlook prior directives as interactions continued. To\ncounter this behavior and maintain consistency, our specific instruc-\ntions were reiterated with each turn. This ensured Mathemyths ’s\nalignment with our intended conversational flow.\n3.2.3 Scaffolding. In our study, we classified the situations where\nchildren require scaffolding into two main categories: (1) cases\nwhere they completely fail to continue the story, either by express-\ning uncertainty (e.g., saying “I don’t know ”) or by not responding; (2)\ninstances where they continue the story with only brief and vague\nresponses, typically less than 5 words. To scaffold the first situation,\nour initial step is to determine whether the child is providing meta-\ncomments (e.g., “I like this ”, “please continue ”) or exhibiting signs\nof confusion (e.g., “I am not sure ”). This determination is made by\nprompting the LLM with a set of few-shot examples. These exam-\nples represent the most common types of responses observed in\nour rapid iteration tests with children. Following this identification,\nwe utilize the model to simplify the question and offer hints related\nto the question, adhering to the “hint and rephrase” strategy. In\naddressing the second situation, we monitor the child’s responses.\nTo scaffold the second situation, we employ the GPT-4 model to\npose a follow-up question based on the child’s preceding brief re-\nsponse. This approach involves first acknowledging what the child\nhas said and then encouraging them to elaborate further on their\ncontributions.\n3.3 Model Evaluation\nAs part of the iterative design process, we conducted an evalu-\nation to examine the technical capabilities of our LLM-powered\n3In the prompt, the model is designated to function as a “storytelling robot”. However,\nduring interactions, we avoid describing our system as a robot to prevent potential\nconfusion, given that it operates as a virtual agent.\nMathemyths CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nsystem. This evaluation consisted of two components: first, assess-\ning the model’s ability to generate questions to elicit children’s re-\nsponses to determine if these questions are fluent, inspirational, and\nlogically relevant; second, evaluating the model’s performance in\ncontinuing stories that are logically relevant, engaging, and age-\nappropriate. Specifically, our goal was to confirm whether the\nprompt-engineered GPT-4 model performs satisfactorily compared\nto a human baseline in both tasks and whether its performance\nsurpasses that of a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model in the question gener-\nation task. We chose the fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model as our baseline\nbecause it was the highest-performing model available that allowed\nfine-tuning during our development phase. Indeed, researchers\nhave used a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model in dialogic interactions with\nchildren, achieving better performance compared to other state-of-\nthe-art models [56].\nAll evaluations were carried out by three college student research\nassistants who had over a year of experience in educational research\nand extensive years of engagement in activities with children within\nthe target age range of our study. These students underwent train-\ning until their inter-rater reliability reached a satisfactory level\nbefore beginning the actual evaluation.\n3.3.1 Evaluating Prompt Engineered GPT-4’s Performance in Ques-\ntion Generation. The generated questions are designed to inspire\nchildren to continue the story and encourage them to learn and use\nmathematical terms. In this evaluation, we compared our prompt-\nengineered GPT-4 model with a fine-tuned GPT-3 model. The fine-\ntuned GPT-3 model was trained4 using a subset of 100 out of 300\nhuman-crafted questions developed by an author of the paper. Be-\nsides these two LLMs, we also included the other subset of human-\ncrafted questions as our baseline.\nThe question evaluation included four matrices, namely read-\nability, inspiration, story relevancy , and math language relevancy .\nWe invited the three evaluators to score the questions across each\nof the four dimensions in a 5-point Likert scale. The inter-rater\nreliability among these evaluators was satisfactory with an average\nof intra-class correlation of 0.82 across four dimensions. Details of\nthese matrices are presented in Table 1.\nAn ANOVA was conducted to compare the ratings of ques-\ntions generated by human, fine-tuned GPT-3.5, and our prompt-\nengineered GPT-4 model. The results indicated significant differ-\nences among the sources for all four dimensions (Readability:𝐹(2)=\n9.415,𝑝 < .001∗∗∗, Inspiration: 𝐹(2)= 11.357,𝑝 < .001∗∗∗, Story\nRelevancy: 𝐹(2)= 17.327,𝑝 < .001∗∗∗, Math Language Relevancy:\n𝐹(2)= 90.687,𝑝 < .001∗∗∗). A post hoc Tukey’s HSD test further\nrevealed that questions generated by both humans and GPT-4 ex-\nhibited higher levels of readability, inspiration, and relevance to\nthe story’s plot and mathematical language when compared to\nquestions generated by the fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model (Fig. 3). The\nevaluation ratings between human-generated and GPT-4 generated\nquestions were comparable, further suggesting the feasibility and\npromise of GPT-4 models in this context. However, the questions,\neither generated by humans or GPT-4, were scored relatively lower\nin the relevance of mathematical language as compared to other\ndimensions but still higher than GPT-3.5. This arises from the com-\nplexity of creating questions that both meaningfully advance the\n4https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning\nstoryline and focus on specific math terms. To preserve the story’s\ncontinuity, the questions’ relevance to stories was often prioritized.\nDespite these, children should still encounter a sufficient number\nof questions aimed at enhancing their understanding and use of\nmathematical concepts.\n3.3.2 Evaluating Prompt Engineered GPT-4’s Performance in Story\nContinuation. Mathemyths is designed to continue the story adap-\ntively based on children’s contributions and integrate mathematical\nlanguage within the story plot. To evaluate whether our prompt-\nengineered GPT-4 model achieved these two goals, we compared\nthe GPT-4 generated stories with those generated by humans as\nour baseline, given that other existing models were not tailored\nto continue stories but rather generate new stories. GPT-4 gener-\nated stories were created using a self-chat technique [30], which\nenabled our dialogue system to engage in self-generated conversa-\ntions, mimicking a child’s interactions, and collaboratively creating\nstories. Human-generated stories were based on the same instruc-\ntions we provided to prompt GPT-4. The process for generating\nthe dataset is detailed in Appendix B. Subsequently, we presented\nthe three evaluators with pairs of stories, one generated by GPT-4\nand the other by humans. Based on a widely recognized method\nfor evaluating AI-generated dialogues [56, 58], we asked them to\nmake a choice from each pair based on four dimensions: preference,\nperceived creativity , mathematics relevancy, and readability. Table 2\nprovides a detailed explanation of these metrics.\nThe results of this evaluation are displayed in Fig. 4. Overall,\nour evaluators indicated that the story pairs, where one was gen-\nerated by humans and the other by GPT-4, were quite comparable\nin quality across all dimensions, particularly in perceived creativ-\nity (50.0% vs. 50.0%). Notably, there was a marginal preference for\nstories generated by AI (53.1% vs. 46.9%), with these stories also\nbeing perceived as integrating more mathematical elements (56.2%\nvs. 43.8%). GPT-4’s advantages in relating stories to mathematical\nelements are likely due to the fact that this task capitalizes on LLMs’\ncapabilities of creating seemingly logical connections of language\nelements based on specific instructions. However, human-generated\nstories were slightly favored for their readability (46.9% vs. 53.1%). A\nfollow-up discussion with the evaluators revealed that the slightly\nlower readability in AI-generated stories primarily stemmed from\ninstances where GPT-4 produced text that, while structurally co-\nherent in its language, occasionally lacked logical consistency. This\nobservation aligns with existing research underscoring the inherent\nlimitations [48, 57].\n3.4 System Implementation\nMathemyths is a desktop application designed to run on a Mac-\nBook computer with built-in microphones and speakers. This appli-\ncation, written in Python, does not rely on any graphical interface\nfor interaction. Instead, users can navigate Mathemyths simply\nby voice. Upon launch, users have the flexibility to specify both\nthe number of dialogue rounds and the mathematical terms they\nwish to learn.

Additionally, the Elevenlabs Speech Synthesis service6 is\nemployed to generate realistic speech for the agent’s responses.\n4 USER STUDY\nTo understand how Mathemyths might support children’s engage-\nment and math language learning, we conducted a user study where\nchildren were randomly assigned to either co-create stories with\n6https://beta.elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis\nMathemyths or with a friendly and skilled human partner. We\nexamined children’s gains in mathematical language knowledge,\ntheir engagement, creation performance, and enjoyment in the\nstorytelling activities, and Mathemyths ’s performance.\n4.1 Procedure\nParticipants were recruited from two public libraries in a mid-west\ncity in the U.S. throughout the summer of 2023. This study was ap-\nproved by the Institutional Review Board of the authors’ institution.\nMathemyths CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nFigure 5: The (a) plushy and (b) speaker used in our user\nstudy.\nAfter obtaining parental consent and child assent, participants were\nintroduced to a research assistant and began the three-part study\nprocedure which consisted of a baseline pretest of children’s math\nlanguage, the story co-creation activity, and a post-test assessing\nmath language, along with a survey with the children. Details of\nthe math language pre- and post-test questionnaire are described\nin the Evaluation Metrics section below.\nFor the story co-creation activity, children were randomly as-\nsigned to partner either with a human (i.e., a train research assis-\ntant) or AI (i.e., Mathemyths ) presented as a colorful speaker\nas displayed in Fig. 5(a), for co-creating two short stories. In both\nconditions, children participated in a warm-up session to famil-\niarize themselves with the story co-creation activity. This session\nalso served to illustrate how the AI or human partner would pre-\ncisely respond to their interactions, including scenarios where the\nchildren asked questions or chose to remain silent. To facilitate\nchildren’s story creation, they were handed a plushy (Fig. 5(b)) in\ncase they wished to act out the story or just hold on to it. After\nthe warm-up session, children were free to interact with the AI\nwithout interference or minimal redirection and instructions from\nthe researcher. For both Mathemyths and human conditions, the\ncreation of each story typically lasted 6 minutes, resulting in a total\nduration of approximately 12 minutes for each child.\nAll parts of the procedure were video recorded for later transcrip-\ntion of the stories and coding of open-ended questions. Participants\nhad the option of completing all three parts in a single session or\ncompleting the baseline assessment one day and returning another\nday to complete the story creation activity and learning evaluation.\nWhile children were completing the story creation activity, parents\nwere provided with a questionnaire on an iPad to collect demo-\ngraphic information about their child. Once the child completed\nthe procedure they were given a small prize and a book as a token\nof appreciation and parents received a twenty-dollar Visa gift card\nfor their participation.\n4.2 Evaluation Metrics\nIn this user study, our focus was on children’s learning of target\nmath vocabulary, the quality of the stories they created, as well\nas their engagement and enjoyment throughout the process. For\nall measures requiring children’s responses, the questions were\norally narrated and asked by an experimenter, and the children\nwere expected to answer orally as well. Thus, children did not need\nreading or writing skills to answer those questions.\n4.2.1 Learning of Math Language. The research team developed\na 24-item questionnaire focusing on the six math terms (i.e., sum,\nestimate, add, subtract, equal, half ), based on the Common Core\nState Standards [3, 45] and Purpura et al. [74]. These terms were\nassessed through four dimensions: definition, recall, transfer, and\npractice, with each dimension comprising six questions, one ques-\ntion for each target term. For the definition dimension, children\nwere prompted to provide the definition of each of the six math\nterms. In the recall dimension, they were asked to identify each\nterm when its definition was given. For transfer questions, children\nneeded to provide an appropriate math term based on a provided\nreal-life scenario. Lastly, in the practice dimension, children were\nasked to use the target math terms to freely generate descriptions\nfor a picture featuring fruits of various types, amounts, sizes, and\ncolors. The complete questionnaire can be found in Appendix C.\nDuring the pre and post-tests, we utilized the same set of ques-\ntionnaires with slight modifications. For example, in the transfer set\nof questions, nouns were changed – (i.e., “you have a jar filled with\ncandies” became “you have a net filled with butterflies”). Addition-\nally, all items were presented in a random order. These modifica-\ntions were implemented to reduce the likelihood that children were\nmerely replicating their answers from the baseline assessment.\nTo calculate the scores from this questionnaire, thedefinition and\npractice items, being open-ended, were rated on a binary scale: 0\nfor incorrect and 1 for correct responses. For the recall and transfer\nitems, children first attempted to answer through free recall. If\nunsuccessful, they were then provided with three options to choose\nfrom. Scores were assigned as follows: 2 for correct free recall\nanswers, 1 for correct answers chosen from the given options, and\n0 for incorrect answers. Based on this scoring system, we calculated\na total score by summing the points across all items, with a possible\nrange from 0 to 36. The Cronbach’s alpha of these items was 0.92.\n4.2.2 Engagement. To understand children’s engagement in the\nstory co-creation activity with either a human or AI partner, we\nanalyzed their responses using three key indicators: whether they\nprovided a verbal response, the length of each response, and the na-\nture of their responses. The nature of responses was categorized into\nfour types: meta-comments reflecting the child’s thought process\n(e.g., “I think so. ”), expressions of uncertainty (e.g., “I don’t know”),\nbrief responses with fewer than five words lacking sufficient details,\nand substantial responses containing meaningful details that ad-\nvance the story. Two trained research assistants were responsible for\nthe coding. The first coded transcripts for all participants, and the\nsecond coded 30% of the data for quality control purposes. Between\nthese two coders, there was a 100% agreement rate across all items.\n4.2.3 Story Creation Performance. We analyzed the children’s per-\nformance on their story creation using two indicators: the number\nof ideas and elaborations, based on prior research [96, 109], An idea\nis defined as a character and its associated action within a single\nutterance. For example, “The cat climbs the tree” is one idea, with\n“cat” as the character and “climbs” as the action. An elaboration\nrefers to additional details provided to enrich the idea, such as when,\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Chao Zhang et al.\nwhere, and why. For instance, “The cat climbs the tree because it’s\ncurious and loves to explore” adds reasoning for the character’s\naction. One researcher coded the transcripts for all participants,\nand another coded 30% of the participants’ transcripts as a quality\ncheck. This process resulted in a satisfactory Intraclass Correlation\nCoefficient of 0.85.\n4.2.4 Enjoyment. To measure children’s enjoyment of interacting\nwith AI or humans, we adapted a 4-item questionnaire based on\nWaytz et al. ’s work [92]. The questions were: (1) Were you happy\nwhen you told stories with []? ; (2) Did you feel comfortable telling sto-\nries with []? ; (3) Would you like to have a reading partner like []? ; and\n(4) Do you want to tell another story with []? . The questionnaire asked\nchildren to indicate their level of agreement with each item, using a\npictorial scale to facilitate their responses. For example, in response\nto the first question, children were presented with five options of\n“really happy, ” “happy, ” “kind of happy, ” “a little bit happy, ” and “not\nhappy at all. ” Each option was associated with a circle varying in\nsize from large to small, with the researcher pointing to each circle\nwhile describing the corresponding option. The size of the circle\ncorresponded to the level of happiness, with the largest circle repre-\nsenting the most happiness and the smallest indicating the least. To\nensure that children based their responses onMathemyths and not\non other voice assistants they may have used at home, we reminded\nthem at the beginning that we were specifically asking about the AI\nthey had just created a story with, while also pointing at the device.\nThe Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency is acceptable at 0.77.\n4.3 Participants\nWe recruited 35 participants (19 female, 16 male) aged between\nfour and eight (𝑀 = 6, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.35) by advertising in local libraries,\nchildcare centers, and through snowball sampling. Participants\nwere randomly allocated to either the experimental condition using\nour system (𝑁 = 19) or the control condition involving a human\npartner (𝑁 = 16). All the participants’ predominant home language\nis English. No significant differences were observed between the\ntwo conditions in terms of children’s gender, age, baseline math\nlanguage skills, race/ethnicity, prior use of conversational agents,\nor caregiver education (Table 3).\n4.4 Results\nIn this section, we discuss our findings regarding children’s learning\nof math language, their engagement, performance in story creation,\nas well as enjoyment with either a human partner or AI, Mathe-\nmyths . It’s important to note that our participants ranged in age\nfrom four to eight years old. This provided a valuable opportunity\nto examine how children at different developmental stages inter-\nact with AI. Thus, we divided the child participants into two age\ngroups: a younger group (ages 4 to 5) and an older group (ages 6 to\n8) [18]. This division allowed us to investigate whether and how\ndevelopmental differences might influence our results.\n4.4.1 Learning of Math Language. Our analysis focused on exam-\nining if there was an improvement in children’s understanding\nof targeted math terms from the pretest to the posttest, first con-\nsidering the effects by condition (i.e., AI versus human) and then\nexamining if these gains varied between the younger and older\nage groups. To address these questions, we carried out a two-way\nrepeated-measures mixed ANOVA, using condition and age group\nas covariates.\nAs shown in Figure 6, the results indicated significant improve-\nments between the pre- ( 𝑀 = 16.686, 𝑆𝐷 = 9.578) and post-test\n(𝑀 = 18.971, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.526) math language total scores ( 𝐹(1,31)=\n17.009,𝑝 < .000∗∗∗). Moreover, these learning gains were found to\nbe comparable across the AI (pre: 𝑀 = 17.105, 𝑆𝐷 = 9.882; post:\n𝑀 = 19.500, 𝑆𝐷 = 11.074) and human (pre: 𝑀 = 16.187, 𝑆𝐷 = 9.501;\npost: 𝑀 = 18.344, 𝑆𝐷 = 10.158) conditions (𝐹(1,31)= 0.012,𝑝 =\n.912). Statistically, children’s learning gains showed marginal vari-\nation across different age groups (𝐹(1,31)= 3.219,𝑝 = .083). On\na descriptive level, older children seemed to benefit more from\nthe co-creation activity than younger children, regardless of their\ninteraction with Mathemyths or a human partner. Thus, this age\ndifference did not seem to stem from the nature of interacting with\nAI, but rather might be due to the fact that older children already\nhave a better understanding of the underlying math concepts in\nthe first place, which might amplify their comprehension of the\nassociated math language.\nTo further unpack children’s learning gains across each dimen-\nsion (i.e., definition, recall, transfer, practice), we carried out addi-\ntional repeated-measures ANOVA analyses. These analyses used\nexperimental conditions and age group as covariates, following\nthe same model we applied in analyzing the total scores. Overall,\nwe found that children’s gain in math language appeared to be\nprimarily driven by their improved scores in answering transfer\nand practice questions, as the pre-to-post-test gains were statis-\ntically significant in these dimensions, but not in definition and\nrecall. However, when analyzing the pre-to-post gains between\nthe story creation partners (human vs AI), AI partners showed\na notable advantage in enhancing children’s performance in def-\ninition questions ( 𝐹(1,18) = 8.308,𝑝 = .010∗∗; pre: 𝑀 = 2.737,\n𝑆𝐷 = 1.939; post: 𝑀 = 3.368, 𝑆𝐷 = 2.047), while children with\nhuman partners did not show significant improvement in this di-\nmension (𝐹(1,15)= 0.015,𝑝 = .903; pre: 𝑀 = 2.813, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.621;\npost: 𝑀 = 2.844, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.777). Further analysis by age group re-\nvealed a consistent pattern across all dimensions: older children\nshowed greater improvements than younger ones, although these\ndifferences were not statistically significant.\nTaking together, Mathemyths has shown to be as effective as\na human partner in supporting children’s math language learning\nthrough storytelling, while also displaying a stronger advantage\nin aiding definition comprehension. Moreover, children from both\nyounger and older age groups benefited from this activity, whether\ninteracting with an AI or human, though older children showed a\nslightly greater advantage.\n4.4.2 Engagement. In our study, children actively engaged in the\nstory co-creation activity withMathemyths . Focusing on the quan-\ntity of their engagement (i.e., response rate and length), children re-\nsponded to over 95% of the questions posed byMathemyths , with\ntheir responses averaging between 6-10 words in length. Generally,\nchildren tended to be more responsive and provided longer answers\nto questions asked by the human partner. Notably, the observed\ndifferences in responsiveness and response length between interac-\ntions with AI and humans appeared to be predominantly exhibited\nMathemyths CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nTable 3: Participant information by study conditions.

Statistically significant\nresults are reported as 𝑝 < 0.05∗, 𝑝 < 0.01∗∗, 𝑝 < 0.001∗∗∗.\nby older children. As shown in Figure 7, younger children did not\ndifferentiate in their behavior towards the AI versus a human: in\nboth conditions, younger children exhibited almost exactly the same\nrate (AI: 𝑀 = 96.002, 𝑆𝐷 = 5.860; Human: 𝑀 = 96.922, 𝑆𝐷 = 6.511)\nand average response length (AI: 𝑀 = 8.414, 𝑆𝐷 = 6.579; Hu-\nman: 𝑀 = 8.968, 𝑆𝐷 = 4.328). However, older children displayed\na different pattern of interaction with humans, characterized by\nmore frequent (AI: 𝑀 = 92.668, 𝑆𝐷 = 13.436; Human: 𝑀 = 99.246,\n𝑆𝐷 = 2.456) and lengthier (AI: 𝑀 = 6.064, 𝑆𝐷 = 4.546; Human:\n𝑀 = 10.358, 𝑆𝐷 = 7.267) responses compared to their interactions\nwith the AI. However, this observed pattern did not reach statistical\nsignificance: The results of two-way ANOVA analyses indicated\nthat there were no significant differences between younger and\nolder participants across all engagement dimensions.\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Chao Zhang et al.\nFigure 7: Box plots and bar plots illustrating the distribution of data and the results from the two-way ANOVA regarding\nchildren’s verbal engagement. Statistically significant results are reported as 𝑝 < 0.05∗, 𝑝 < 0.01∗∗, 𝑝 < 0.001∗∗∗. Error bars\nrepresent 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nIn terms of the nature of children’s responses, the majority were\nactual answers that advanced the stories, either substantial or short.\nThis trend was consistent, regardless of whether children partnered\nwith Mathemyths or a human. However, we observed that children\nwere less likely to provide substantial responses when interacting\nwith Mathemyths compared to a human. Additionally, interac-\ntions with Mathemyths elicited a higher incidence of uncertain\nresponses, like “I don’t know”, though still relatively infrequent, at a\nrate of 9.9%, as opposed to 1.8% when interacting with humans. This\nincreased frequency of uncertainty in the AI condition might be\nattributed to Mathemyths ’s tendency to pose unusual or fantasy-\noriented questions. For instance, Mathemyths asked questions\nlike how the characters can use a cloud to speed up their journey,\nwhich are less realistic than questions asked by a researcher such\nas “How can they get through the traffic circle faster?” Neverthe-\nless, the use of unusual and imaginative elements in responses may\nnot necessarily be negative, and is actually a common feature in\nchildren’s literature, especially for younger audiences. Our analysis\nof uncertain responses by younger versus older children revealed\nan interesting trend. While children in general exhibited a higher\nrate of uncertainty when responding to AI, this tendency was more\npronounced among older children. Specifically, younger children\nshowed a 7.6% rate of uncertain responses to AI, compared to 10.9%\nfor older children. In contrast, with human interaction, the rate of\nuncertain responses was only 3.5% for younger children and even\nlower at 0.5% for older children.\n4.4.3 Story Creation Performance. We then focused on the quality\nof the stories children created, measured by the number of ideas\nand elaborations. On average, a child produced about 0.5 idea per\nprompt during interactions with either AI or humans (AI:𝑀 = .443,\n𝑆𝐷 = .392; Human: 𝑀 = .616, 𝑆𝐷 = .404), amounting to nearly one\nidea every two prompts. In terms of elaboration, children typically\noffered 0.3 detailed elaboration per turn, equating to approximately\n1 elaborate response every three prompts interactions with both\nAI and humans (AI: 𝑀 = .285, 𝑆𝐷 = .241; Human: 𝑀 = .360,\n𝑆𝐷 = .390). As shown in Figure 8, a two-way ANOVA, examin-\ning experimental conditions and age groups, indicated that there\nwere no significant differences in the quality of story creation be-\ntween the Mathemyths and human conditions (ideas: 𝐹(1,66)=\n2.380,𝑝 = .128; elaboration: 𝐹(1,66)= .551,𝑝 = .461), nor between\nyounger and older children (ideas: 𝐹(1,66)= .165,𝑝 = .686; elabo-\nration: 𝐹(1,66)= .130,𝑝 = .720).\nNevertheless, it might be quite surprising that younger children\nperformed on par with their older peers in this metric, especially\nfor those who interacted with the Mathemyths (Figure 8), despite\nyounger children’s presumably less developed language ability. Yet,\nthis might be due to the scaffolding features that we included, such\nas posing follow-up questions and providing hints when children\ndid not formulate substantive responses. These features appeared\nto be effective in further eliciting children’s responses and engaging\nthem in back-and-forth interactions around one prompt. Thus, the\nscaffolding features could have reduced the presumed differences in\nthe extent of idea elaboration between older and younger children.\n4.4.4 Enjoyment. As shown in Figure 9, children’s responses to\nthe survey items indicated an overall positive perception of the\nstory co-creation experience. Descriptively, they showed a more\nfavorable reaction to reading with a human partner in terms of en-\njoyment (AI: 𝑀 = 3.68, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.250; Human: 𝑀 = 4.31, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.195)\nand comfort level (AI: 𝑀 = 3.42, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.071; Human: 𝑀 = 3.88,\n𝑆𝐷 = 1.310) compared to AI. Moreover, children slightly favored the\nidea of having the experimenter they interacted with as a reading\npartner (AI: 𝑀 = 3.05, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.682; Human: 𝑀 = 3.38, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.628)\nbut expressed more interest in reading another story with Mathe-\nmyths (AI: 𝑀 = 2.42, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.805; Human: 𝑀 = 2.38, 𝑆𝐷 = 1.455).\nHowever, a two-way ANOVA comparing the two conditions across\ndifferent ages indicated that there were no significant differences\nbetween the AI and human conditions (𝐹(1,31)= .501,𝑝 = .484) or\namong younger and older participants (𝐹(1,31)= .106,𝑝 = .746)\nacross all questions in this enjoyment questionnaire. Additionally,\nno interaction effect was observed between age groups and condi-\ntions.\n4.4.5 Mathemyths Performance. The findings in terms of chil-\ndren’s learning, engagement, story creation performance, and en-\njoyment above might be better contextualized within the perfor-\nmance of Mathemyths . In this section, we discuss Mathemyths\n’s performance in terms of interpreting children’s spoken input as\nwell as its performance in generating responses for children.\nMathemyths CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nFigure 8: Box plots illustrating the data distribution, along with the results of the two-way ANOVA comparing the story creation\nperformance of children, using condition and age group as covariates. Statistically significant results are reported as 𝑝 < 0.05∗,\n𝑝 < 0.01∗∗, 𝑝 < 0.001∗∗∗.\nFigure 9: Box plots illustrating the data distribution, along with the results of the two-way ANOVA comparing children’s\nenjoyment, using condition and age group as covariates. Statistically significant results are reported as 𝑝 < 0.05∗, 𝑝 < 0.01∗∗,\n𝑝 < 0.001∗∗∗.\nIn terms of speech recognition performance, we manually as-\nsessed the accuracy with which the agent in our system recognized\nchildren’s speech and provided semantically meaningful feedback\nduring each conversational exchange. Our findings revealed that\n87% of children’s utterances were accurately recognized, resulting\nin feedback that accurately incorporated children’s input. Elect-\ning unconventional names presented difficulties for the system to\naccurately decipher. It is noteworthy that this challenge was not\nexclusive to our automated system but was also encountered by\nour human experimenter. Furthermore, certain errors might not be\nsolely ascribed to the limitations of the speech recognition technol-\nogy; they were related to the lack of sufficient contextual informa-\ntion in the children’s speech. For instance, when a child said the\nword “knight” in isolation, the system registered it as “night” and\nsubsequently proceeded with the follow-up question based on this\ninterpretation. This prompted the child to clarify this with Mathe-\nmyths by specifying “A knight with a sword. ” Among the successful\nresponses, we adapted an open-source, validated gibberish detec-\ntion model [50] to measure the frequency of nonsensical responses.\nAccording to the model’s predictions, none of the AI responses were\nidentified as non-sensible. About 80% were classified as entirely\nsensible, while the remaining responses were borderline sensible\n(overall sensible but containing some elements that were illogical).\nIn terms of the performance of the story creation by AI, we\nused the same metric as we used to evaluate children’s story cre-\nation, namely the number of ideas and elaborations. We compared\nthe number of ideas and elaborations observed in AI-generated\nresponses versus responses produced by human researchers. On av-\nerage, the number of ideas and elaborations generated by humans\n(𝑀 = 1.938)and AI (𝑀 = 2.585)is quite comparable. However,\nthere is a substantially larger variation in the stories generated by\nhumans (𝑆𝐷 = 0.983) than those generated by AI ( 𝑆𝐷 = 0.417),\nsuggesting a higher level of consistency in AI performance. Further\nexamination of the nature of ideas and elaborations generated by\nthe AI and humans corroborated the findings of the model evalua-\ntion mentioned in Section 3.3.2. To reiterate, while Mathemyths\n’s ideas and elaborations were comparable to humans in terms of\ncreativity and math relevance, the AI’s contributions posed more\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Chao Zhang et al.\nchallenges in readability, likely attributed to its frequent incorpora-\ntion of fantasy elements and unrealistic story plots (e.g., a giraffe\nshrinks itself to fit a small space.)\nTaking together, our analysis suggested that whileMathemyths\nperforms satisfactorily in terms of speech recognition and story\ncreation. However, there are certain aspects, such as the charac-\nteristics of the narrative stories, diverge from the typical patterns\nseen with a human story co-creation partner. In the Discussion\nsection below, we will elucidate how such human/AI similarities\nand differences may have contributed to variations in children’s\nlearning approaches and interaction behaviors.\n5 DISCUSSION\nThis paper explored the potential of using LLMs to develop conver-\nsational systems for teaching mathematical language via child-AI\nco-creative storytelling. Our iterative design and development pro-\ncess provides insights into how prompt engineering methods might\nfeasibly be adapted to suit LLMs for young children in a specific\neducational context, and the model evaluation suggests that prompt-\nengineered LLMs could produce questions and stories approaching\nhuman-like quality. A subsequent user study further showed that\nthe math learning outcomes resulting from interactions with LLMs\nwere also comparable with those from interactions with humans,\nyet the engagement patterns of different ages differed.\nIn the remainder of this section, we will discuss how our study\nspeaks to the growing body of literature on child-AI interactions\nand how we introduce new evidence to still under-explored areas,\nthe design of LLMs as educational, conversational partners. We will\nthen discuss design implications that could guide future develop-\nments. Finally, we will address potential limitations and outline a\nfuture research agenda.\n5.1 AI as Storytelling and Learning Partners\nOur paper provides evidence on children’s learning and engagement\nwith Mathemyths , as an example of LLMs-based conversational\npartners. There is a substantial body of prior studies showing that\nchildren can learn from their interactions with AI. However, these\nlearning experiences were primarily structured to align with formal\npedagogical discourse, in which children were expected to respond\nto the AI’s questions with definitive, correct answers [100, 102, 103].\nHowever, our study goes further to suggest that children can ac-\nquire mathematical language through free-form interactions in a\nnarrative-based context with AI, replicating the benefits of the ap-\nproach used by human educators to teach mathematical language\nthrough storytelling. Moreover, our results indicate that this form\nof learning can manifest in multiple ways. Children demonstrated\nan improved ability to define and recall the mathematical terms\nthey were exposed to. Moreover, they exhibited proficiency in trans-\nferring this knowledge to different contexts and using these terms\nmore accurately. Interestingly, earlier studies that explored the ed-\nucational benefits of interacting with an AI companion primarily\nfocused on assessing children’s information recall [99, 110]. This\nemphasis may have arisen because those previous studies were\nintentionally structured to facilitate more organized conversations\nfor a set of facts [ 99]. However, in our study, we observed that\nchildren not only improved their information recall but also demon-\nstrated enhancements in applying that information and expressing\ncreativity in their language use. This observation can, to some ex-\ntent, be attributed to the increased sense of empowerment and\nagency that children experienced during their story co-creation\nwith Mathemyths .\nNonetheless, children appeared to display somewhat different\nengagement patterns during their interactions with Mathemyths\nin comparison to their interactions with our human researcher.\nWhen considering response quantity, including response rate and\nlength, it appears that children exhibited a slightly more active\nengagement pattern when interacting with humans. However, this\ndisparity became noticeable primarily among the older children\nin our study, as younger children did not seem to differentiate in\nterms of response rate or response length between interactions\nwith AI and humans. This growing divergence in engagement with\nAI and humans with age could be attributed, in part, to children’s\nperceptions of AI, in particular, their understanding of what AI’s\ncapabilities and limitations [31, 104]. Specifically, previous research\nhas identified that older children (aged 7-8) were more inclined\nto seek factual information from voice assistants and increasingly\nsought personal information from humans, as compared to younger\nchildren (aged 4 and 5) [31]. Intriguingly, the trend observed in our\nstudy aligns with age-related findings concerning the behavior of\nseeking personal information rather than factual information. This\nalignment is to some extent consistent with the design of Math-\nemyths , which aims to promoting story co-creation that might\ndeviate from a question-answering pedagogical paradigm where\nthe conversational AI’s primary function is to provide factual infor-\nmation. Furthermore, the differences between age groups were also\ndemonstrated in their behavior of using our scaffolding features.\nYounger children required support from the scaffolding on more oc-\ncasions, yet their creative performance with the scaffolding was on\npar with that of their older peers. This finding aligns with expecta-\ntions, considering younger children possess less-developed literacy\nskills. Our scaffolding features enable younger children to engage\nin and benefit from the new math language learning activity on an\nequal footing with older children. This supports previous research\nadvocating for the initiation of math language interventions at an\nearlier age [71, 82]. Lastly, we examined children’s preferences for\nco-creating stories with AI or humans and found that children rated\nboth AI and human favorably. However, despite our best efforts to\nensure focused evaluations of the specific co-creation partners, it\nremains essential to acknowledge that children might have drawn\nupon prior AI interactions, such as those with voice assistants at\ntheir homes, which could potentially influence their perceptions\nduring the study [91].\n5.2 Design Challenges of LLMs for Educational\nTechnologies\nIn the design of Mathemyths , we encountered three challenges\nrelated to leveraging LLMs for educational technologies.\n5.2.1 Iterative Prompt Engineering Optimization for LLMs. The ca-\npability of LLMs has attracted much attention from researchers\nto build educational tools for children [ 51]. This paper provides\npivotal evidence on how to optimize LLMs as story co-creators for\nMathemyths CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nchildren’s math language learning through prompt engineering.\nDuring our development, we found that LLMs, with their impressive\ngenerative capabilities, exhibited a higher degree of unpredictability\nin their outputs compared to specialized machine learning models\nspecifically tailored for narrower tasks. The primary reason is that\nthe nuances of how LLMs interpret our prompts remain a “black-\nbox” for developers. In our efforts at prompt-engineering, there\nwas no guarantee that revising prompts would consistently yield\nthe desired outcomes. This uncertainty aligns with Lin et al. ’s re-\nsearch [59], where they reported LLMs exhibit “dispersion” in their\npotential predictions for a fixed input (i.e., prompt). Empirical evi-\ndence suggests that prompt engineers often overgeneralize based\non single instances of success or failure when modifying prompts,\nas noted in a recent paper [106]. Therefore, to improve the chances\nof creating prompts that yield consistent intended results, exten-\nsive testing of prompts is crucial. This involves comparing the\nconsistency of outputs and engaging in a refinement process, often\ncharacterized by trial and error. Though the prompt engineering\nprocess might potentially involve a large number of iterations, re-\nfining prompts is relatively less time-consuming, especially when\ncompared to traditional AI model fine-tuning or training.\n5.2.2 Fine-grained Control over LLMs’ Performance. While LLMs’\nimpressive general language capability allows for easy instruction\nbased on descriptive language, it remains a challenge to provide\nprecise directives to control the output specifically. A significant\naspect of this challenge is associated with LLM’s limited capacities\nin numerical reasoning [107]. For instance, given thatMathemyths\nwas tailored for young children, we aimed to use brief and sim-\nple language to facilitate comprehension. However, when we set\nspecific word limits within each sentence for GPT-4 (e.g., “each sen-\ntence should not exceed 10 words ”), the model often disregarded such\nconstraints. In contrast, descriptive instructions without numeric\nvalues, like “keep language brief and child-friendly , ” consistently\nproduced better results. In light of these limitations, other research\nrecommends incorporating mechanisms for quality checks when\nprecision in output is a priority. Feedback loops [54] and validation\nlayers [38] have been suggested to ensure the model’s output aligns\nwith the desired requirements.\nAnother observation in our development process relates to LLMs\noccasionally sidestepping structural directives from the original\nprompt after extended conversations. For example, if GPT-4 is in-\nstructed to maintain a specific narrative structure in its responses, it\nmight deviate if these instructions are given only at the beginning.\nThis issue could be attributed to the introduction of non-narrative\nstructural context (e.g., story content, children’s responses) through-\nout the interaction, which imposes a heavy memory load on LLMs [61].\nShi et al. [85] also found that the inclusion of information irrelevant\nto problem-solving dramatically decreases LLM performance. To\ncounteract this, we employed injection prompting at the end of each\ninput, a point where LLMs perform best in using longer context [61],\nstrategically placing reminders within ongoing interactions. This\napproach enhanced response consistency and adherence to the\ndesired structural format in every response.\n5.2.3 Mitigation of the Impact of LLM Hallucinations. Hallucina-\ntions refer to situations where responses generated by LLMs may\ninitially seem plausible but are actually nonsensical or factually\nincorrect [48, 57]. These models, without correct understanding of\nconcepts, appear to be knowledgeable because they present lan-\nguage associated with the concepts, but without logical filtering. In\nour research,Mathemyths was specifically designed to engage chil-\ndren in story creation involving fantasy elements, rather than tasks\ninvolving mathematical counting or calculation. This approach may\nhave, to some extent, mitigated the issues of factual inaccuracies.\nNevertheless, Mathemyths still produced content that appeared\nless feasible in a real-life context. For instance, it occasionally cre-\nated unusual connections between two common story elements,\nsuch as “using clouds to add speed to a journey. ” Though the idea\nof using cloud to speed up might seem imaginative in the context\nof a fantasy story [109], it might be problematic in contexts such\nas the teaching of scientific concepts, where unrealistic ideas could\nlead to confusion or misconceptions. This could also explain why\nthe older children were drawn to the human partner, as they might\nfind the nonsensical language weird. Nevertheless, as the field of\nhallucination mitigation in LLMs is relatively nascent, future re-\nsearch could benefit from exploring post-processing techniques that\nscrutinize AI-generated content that might contain hallucinatory\ninformation [23] or employing external knowledge as a framework\nto guide and calibrate the generation of information [78] in LLM-\nbased dialogue systems.\n5.3 Design Implications for Child-AI\nCo-Creative Storytelling Systems\nIn this section, we discuss some design implications of our study.\nOur team has already begun improvements to our co-creative sto-\nrytelling system based on the considerations below.\n5.3.1 Generating Adaptive Questions. During storytelling, Math-\nemyths generates questions to elicit children’s responses. How-\never, some children found certain questions challenging to answer.\nThis was evident from the notably higher rate of uncertainty in\ntheir responses to AI-generated questions compared to those posed\nby human partner. While we implemented scaffolding features to\nassist children when they struggle to respond, the AI might not\nalways capture the nuances of a child’s emotions and experiences.\nSpecifically, it may not always discern precisely what factors (e.g.,\nlanguage barriers, math knowledge gaps, or unwillingness to partic-\nipate) caused their struggle. As a result, while the AI provided some\nscaffolding based on several broad categories, it did not offer more\ntailored adjustments in response to the unique challenges faced\nby individual children. One design consideration is to integrate\nmore adaptive algorithms into LLM-based tools that can accurately\nassess a child’s cognitive load based on their responses and adjust\nthe complexity of the questions accordingly.\n5.3.2 Providing Multi-modal Creativity Support. Our study revealed\nthe potential benefits of child-AI co-creative storytelling for enhanc-\ning children’s creativity. Mathemyths was developed for verbal\ninteractions with children, which was a significant initial step con-\nsidering our primary focus on the language capabilities of LLMs. For\nfuture designs, incorporating graphical interfaces or multimedia el-\nements could be beneficial. Such additions would enable children to\nvisualize the story narratives, allowing them to express their ideas\nnot only through words but also through drawings, animations,\nCHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA Chao Zhang et al.\nand sound effects. This can not only augment children’s creative\nexperience [108, 109], but also improve children’s comprehension\nof abstract concepts [22]. In this context, consistent interactions\nwith AI, which might promote long-term creativity in children,\nbecome even more significant as they have shown the capability to\nlearn or emulate creativity from AI interactions [5, 6].\n5.3.3 Supporting Embodied Interaction. In this paper,Mathemyths\nengages children in joint storytelling through a device similar to\nsmart-speakers. While this platform can be easily navigated via\nvoice, it might fall short in conveying emotions or actions—a vital\naspect that captivates children during interactions with human\ncounterparts. To compromise it during our user study, we provided\nchildren with a plushy. Nonetheless, this might not fully capture\nthe advantages of tangible interactions. A promising solution could\nbe to integrate this virtual agent with an embodied robot, which\ncan offer more vivid feedback through its human-like expressions\nand behaviors [43, 95]. It is potential that an embodied robot could\nstimulate different or perhaps heightened levels of engagement.\nHowever, the cost implications and scalability concerns associated\nwith robots cannot be ignored.\n5.4 Limitations and Future Work\nWhile our study offers preliminary insights, it also paves the way\nfor addressing further questions in the future.\nFirst, in our user study, we compared children’s interactions with\nMathemyths with those with a trained researcher who adhered\nto a strict protocol for narrating stories. This protocol ensured the\ninclusion of a specified number of mathematical terms. While this\napproach granted us a controlled environment, ensuring consis-\ntent mathematical language exposure for the children, it might\nhave constrained the natural adaptability and spontaneity that a\nhuman experimenter can bring to the storytelling process. In future\nresearch, it would be intriguing to also compare children’s engage-\nment and enjoyment with a human partner who can fully harness\ntheir natural storytelling capabilities.\nRelated, we compared the learning outcomes between story-\ntelling with AI or humans but did not include a comparison to\nmore conventional instructional methods, such as directly teaching\nthe terms, providing examples, allowing the child to practice, and\noffering corrective feedback. Although prior research has indicated\nsuperior learning outcomes with story-based methods involving\na teacher, exploring whether this advantage over direct instruc-\ntion extends to AI-driven contexts presents an intriguing research\navenue. Additionally, our current participant pool predominantly\nconsists of families with higher educational backgrounds. These\nchildren are likely to have greater access to conversational AI tech-\nnologies, which may have influenced their interaction with our\nsystem. Future research should focus on including children with\nlimited technological access to evaluate if LLM-based learning tools\nremain effective in such contexts.\nIn addition, our study’s participants engaged in only two AI col-\nlaborative storytelling sessions. This short-term access might not\nfully reflect the dynamics of extended interactions children might\nhave with such systems. As children become more accustomed\nto the AI over time, their expectations could evolve, potentially\nrequiring more advanced and adaptive storytelling experiences. On\nthe other hand, repeated sessions could lead to a more harmonized\nchild-AI collaboration, potentially enriching the storytelling pro-\ncess. Future studies should explore these longer-term dynamics,\nperhaps by giving children extended opportunities to interact with\nthe AI storytelling system and tracking their engagement patterns\nover extended periods.\n5.5 A Note on Ethical Considerations\nThe safe use of AI by children has been a topic of public discussion\nfor some time. As we transition to an era dominated by generative\nAI, the debate becomes even more pressing. In this new landscape,\nchildren may directly encounter content produced by AI without\nthe protective filters traditionally provided by human oversight. In\nthis section, we will focus on some ethical considerations pertaining\nto privacy and safety.\nIn terms of privacy, Mathemyths utilizes two cloud-based ser-\nvices to process children’s utterances: Google’s speech-to-text for\ntranscribing and OpenAI’s GPT-4 to interpret their responses. Both\ncompanies offer measures to protect children’s data. Specifically,\nchildren’s utterances are not stored and are promptly deleted after\ntranscription by Google Cloud. Additionally, OpenAI commits not\nto train their models with data passed through their APIs7. How-\never, when these cloud-based AI products enter the market, the\nadequacy of children’s data privacy protection remains uncertain\ndue to the absence of specific regulations for AI products. While\nthe US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regulates\nthe collection and use of personal information from those under\n13, it has yet to be updated to tackle the emerging concerns related\nto AI.\nIn terms of safefy, to safeguard against inappropriate AI-generated\ncontent, we integrated a moderation layer, utilizing the OpenAI\nAPIs8, to ensure outputs were devoid of sexual content, hate speech,\nharassment, violence, or self-harm. However, this content filtering\napproach might not be as effective in addressing biases and stereo-\ntypes (e.g., when a child asks “What do girls do? ”, and the AI agent\nresponds “housewives”), given that these biases are as deeply in-\ngrained in the data used to train AI systems as they are in the rest of\nthe culture. Nonetheless, a growing number of studies have begun\nto investigate methods for detecting and reducing such stereotypes\nand biases, although these studies have not specifically focused on\nchildren. Given the present state of technology, a viable approach\nwould be to deploy LLMs within a “walled garden”—limiting inter-\nactions to narrower domains, like the math-focused narratives in\nour study. Such confines might mitigate risks while still capitalizing\non the capabilities of LLMs.\n6 CONCLUSION\nWhile AI has been utilized for structured interactions with children\nfor quite a while, such as dialogic question-answering, the affor-\ndance provided by LLMs in facilitating free-form, creative tasks, like\njoint storytelling, signifies a groundbreaking shift. This research\nexplores that very frontier. Our findings suggested that, although\nthe learning outcomes with AI mirror those with human partners,\nthe interaction dynamics are different. Instead of viewing this as a\n7https://openai.com/api-data-privacy\n8https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations\nMathemyths CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\nlimitation, it might be more fruitful to recognize AI as providing a\nunique interaction opportunity. These interactions, while different,\ncould supplement children’s everyday human interactions. Given\nthe rapid advancements in LLMs, the capabilities we observe today\nare likely to further refine in the near future. Yet, the insights gar-\nnered now will shape and anchor our design philosophies as we\nmove forward.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis paper is supported by the National Science Foundation under\nGrant No. 2302730.

I’m Mathemyths. I’m\nreally looking forward to spending some time with you\ntoday! May I know your name, please?\nCHILD: My name is Nick.\nAGENT: Nice to meet you, Nick! Now, could you please\ntell me how you’re feeling today? Are you feeling happy,\nexcited, or maybe a little sleepy?\nCHILD: I’m happy!\nAGENT: Thank you for sharing your feelings! I’m here\nto make your day more fun. How about we make up\na story together? We’ll use our imaginations and even\nlearn some math words. I’ll start, then you can add to\nthe story. If you have any questions or need help, just ask\nme. Always remember, the power of our imaginations\nknows no bounds!\nA.2 Global Setting\nAGENT: Now, let’s come up with a cool main charac-\nter for the story. This could be an animal, a person, a\nmythical creature, or anything else that fits our story.\nWhat do you want our main character to be?\nCHILD: The main character is a panda!\nAGENT: That’s interesting! What’s the character’s name?\nCHILD: Her name is Lucy.\nAGENT: Great! Where will our story happen?\nCHILD: It will happen in a forest.\nAGENT: Alright! We’ll dive into an incredible adventure\nwith a panda named Lucy in the forest. Ready to start\nthe story? Let’s go!\nA.3 Opening\nAGENT: Once upon a time, in the heart of a green\nforest, lived a playful panda named Lucy. One sunny\nafternoon, she found an unusual map, and along with\nher new friend, a little child named Nick, they embarked\non an exciting journey to find a hidden treasure.\nA.4 Storytelling\nAGENT: Lucy and Nick decided to ask help from Lucy’s\nfather, Mr. Bamboo. He looked at the map and told them,\n“The treasure is hidden 100 steps away from the ancient\noak tree. ” He then added, “You must also find the half-\nway point, which is half of the total steps, that is, 50\nsteps from the start. ”\nAGENT: In this context, “ half” is when you split some-\nthing into two equal parts, like splitting 100 steps into\n50 steps.\nAGENT: How will Lucy and Nick to find the half-way\npoint?\nCHILD: Lucy goes to the halfway point; I go to the end,\nand finally we find all the treasure!\nAGENT: Wonderful idea! That’s a clever way to divide\nand conquer the search.\nA.5 Scaffolding\nAGENT: What will Lucy and Nick do next to make sure\ntheir steps equals the total distance to the treasure?\nCHILD: I don’t know.\nAGENT: That’s okay! Let’s think together. Lucy and\nNick can take turns counting their steps. If they keep\ntrack, how can they make sure their total steps equal\nthe distance to the treasure?\nB PROCESS OF CRAFTING DATASET FOR\nEVALUATING STORY CONTINUATIONS\nTo evaluate whether our prompt-engineered GPT-4 model could\ncontinue the story adaptively based on children’s contributions and\nintegrate mathematical language within the story plot, we com-\npared the GPT-4 generated stories with those generated by humans\nas our baseline. GPT-4 generated stories were created using a self-\nchat technique [30], which enabled our dialogue system to engage\nin self-generated conversations, mimicking a child’s interactions,\nand collaboratively creating stories. From this, we compiled a col-\nlection of 8 conversations, each consisting of six dialogue rounds,\nforming a complete story. Then, we recruited two graduate students\nin education to create another 8 stories via six rounds of human-\nto-human dialogue. We provided these human narrators with a\ndetailed list of specific instructions like the list of mathematical\nterms they have to use. The story content told by one speaker dur-\ning each dialogue round is deemed a story continuation. In total, we\ncompiled 96 LLM-crafted and 96 human-crafted story continuations\nfor our evaluation.\nC ITEMS IN THE MATHEMATICAL\nLANGUAGE ASSESSMENT IN THE USER\nSTUDY\nC.1 Mathematical Language Definition\n(1) What does the word “equal” mean?\n(2) What does the word “half” mean?\n(3) What does the word “add” mean?\n(4) What does the word “subtract” mean?\n(5) What does the word “estimate” mean?\n(6) What does the word “sum” mean?\nC.2 Mathematical Language Recall\n(1) What is one word that means “the same amount”?\n(Estimate, Equal, or Sum)\n(2) What is one word that means “a total amount”?\n(Equal, Add, or Sum)\nMathemyths CHI ’24, May 11–16, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA\n(3) What is one word that means “plus”?\n(Add, Subtract, or Half )\n(4) What is one word that means “to take away”?\n(Sum, Subtract, or Estimate)\n(5) What is one word that means “to cut in two”?\n(Add, Half, or Estimate)\n(6) What is one word that means “a good guess” when you can’t\ncount how many things there are?\n(Sum, Estimate, or Subtract)\nC.3 Mathematical Language Transfer — Posttest\n(1) Let’s say you have 5 books and your friend also has 5 books.\nHow does the number of books you have compare to the\nnumber of books your friend has?\n(More, Half, or Equal)\n(2) Let’s imagine you have a net filled with butterflies.
