Sever al theories of suicide have\nbeen proposed since the beginning of the past century, and a m yriad of neurobiological\nstudies have been conducted over the past two decades in orde r to elucidate its\npathophysiology.

About one million\npeople die of suicide worldwide with the highest rates seen in wh ite middle-aged men. Suicide\nis the tenth leading cause of death in the US and each year ∼42,773 Americans die by suicide.\nThe annual age-adjusted suicide rate is ∼12.93/100,000 and costs the US $44 billion annually\n(Prevention AFfS, 2014 ). Even though the cause of suicidal behavior is thought to be multifactorial\n(Hawton and van Heeringen, 2009 ), one of the most common risk factors is a psychiatric disorder\n(Arsenault-Lapierre et al., 2004 ) amongst which mood disorders, major depressive disorder, an d\nbipolar disorder rank the highest ( Harris and Barraclough, 1997 ).\nThe very incomprehensibility of the suicidal act has been occu pying the mind of researchers and\nhealth professionals for a long time. Several theories have b een proposed over the past decades,\ndescribing underlying factors, acute triggers and population s at risk. One of the most inﬂuential\nmodels proposed by Mann’s group ( Mann et al., 1999 ), was by applying the diathesis-stress model\non suicidal behavior. It describes individuals having a cert ain vulnerability (“diathesis”) to suicidal\nbehavior, which in combination with psychosocial crises or ps ychiatric disorders (“stress”), will\nLudwig et al. Life Span Model of Suicide\nresult in actual suicidal behavior ( Mann et al., 1999; van\nHeeringen, 2012; van Heeringen and Mann, 2014 ). Another\nacclaimed theory is the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, a th ree-\nfactor model by Joiner and colleagues. The Interpersonal Theo ry\nof suicide is a psychological model which proposes suicidal des ire\nand capability of suicide as the principal factors ( Joiner, 2005 ).\nSuicidal desire explained by high levels of burdensomeness a nd\nthwarted belongingness are cognitive variables which are d iﬃcult\nto describe in a neurobiological frame, whereas the capabili ty of\nsuicide might be explained by the sum of genetic, epigenetic an d\nenvironmental factors which will be discussed in this revie w.\nThe neurobiology of suicide is a vast ﬁeld, ranging from\ncandidate gene studies in the very beginning ( Abbar et al., 1995 )\nto miRNA expression recently ( Smalheiser et al., 2012 ). Genetic\nassociations between suicide and polymorphisms of the HPA-\naxis (\nFudalej et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2016 ), serotonin system\n(Anguelova et al., 2003; Bach and Arango, 2012; de Medeiros\nAlves et al., 2015; Höfer et al., 2016 ), noradrenergic system\n(Chandley and Ordway, 2012 ) and polyamines ( Fiori et al., 2010 )\nhave been established. For a thorough review of neurobiolog ical\nﬁndings from the neuroimaging point of view, it is useful to\nconsult van Heeringen’s and Mann’s recent publication (\nvan\nHeeringen and Mann, 2014 ).\nPsychological theories and neurobiological ﬁndings tend t o\nwork in parallel: both need behavioral and empirical data to\nconﬁrm their claims. In this review, we are proposing a Life\nSpan Model of Suicide with an attempt to integrate Joiner’s\nInterpersonal Model of Suicide and Mann’s Stress-Diathesis\nModel and support it by providing a thorough compilation of\nrelated neurobiological ﬁndings.\nSUICIDE AND MODELS OF SUICIDE\nSuicide, self-harm, and attempted suicide are highly complex\nbehaviors which are thought to be multifactorial and the\ncontributing factors can be divided into “proximal and dista l\nstressors” or state- and trait-dependent factors (\nHawton and van\nHeeringen, 2009 ). A dozen psychological models of suicide have\nbeen described, tested, and empirically supported ( Barzilay and\nApter, 2014 ). Amongst most of these models, stress seems to be\na key cause for primary psychopathology, and the act of suicide\nis often envisioned as a reaction to extreme unbearable stre ss.\nUnfortunately, stress models of suicidal behavior cannot ex plain\nthe reasons why extreme stress does not lead to suicide in all stress\nexposed individuals. For instance, not all individuals expose d to\nchildhood trauma will develop psychiatric problems indicati ng\nthe need to examine the role of diathesis in selected individ uals\n(\nvan Heeringen, 2012 ).\nThe Stress-Diathesis-Model\nThese above described observations paved the way to a better\nexplanatory model of suicide proposed by Mann et al. that\ninvolves a predisposing diathesis as a “distal risk factor” wh ich\nwhen combined with “proximal risk factors” act as precipitants\nand increases the risk of suicide (\nMann et al., 1999 ). Distal risk\nfactors include developmental, personality, family, and gen etic\nfactors such as childhood adversities, family history of su icide,\nand impulsive-aggressive personality traits. Proximal risk f actors\ninclude life events, stress, and psychiatric disorders inclu ding\nsubstance abuse. Interestingly, suicidal patients diﬀer fro m non-\nsuicidal patients in distal stressors and additionally, prox imal risk\nfactors might serve as triggers for suicidal behavior ( Roy et al.,\n2009).\nMann et al. (1999) proposed a clinical model based on\nﬁndings from a sample of 347 consecutive patients admitted\nfor mood disorders, psychoses, and other diagnoses. Lifetime\nsuicide attempts, aggressive traits and impulsivity, objecti ve\nand subjective severity of psychopathology, developmental an d\nfamily history, and past substance abuse including alcoholi sm\nwere evaluated. Suicide attempters demonstrated higher scor es\non subjective depression, more lifetime episodes of major\ndepression/psychoses, higher scores on suicidal ideation an d\nfewer reasons for living when compared to non-attempters. Also ,\nsuicide attempters showed higher rates of lifetime aggressi on and\nimpulsivity, family history of suicide, head injury, and chil d abuse\nwhen compared to non-attempters.\nBy factor analysis two state factors (psychosis and depression)\nand one trait factor (aggression/impulsivity) were generat ed.\nUsing logistic regression, the authors demonstrated that\naggression/impulsivity was strongly associated with lifet ime\nsuicide attempts whereas psychosis and depression were not\nsigniﬁcant predictors of lifetime suicide attempt (\nMann et al.,\n1999).\nMann et al. (1999) proposed a hypothetical, predictive stress-\ndiathesis model in which the risk for suicidal actions is not only\ndue to a proximal stressor but also due to a distal stressor—\nthe diathesis. To reach the threshold of suicidal behavior, both\ncomponents are required. Mann’s model conceptualizes diathesis\nas a dynamic condition of continuous character, underlinin g that\nit can vary during the lifespan and that it is not dichotomous.\nMelhem et al. (2007) demonstrated that diathesis for suicide is\npartly heritable and has familial transmissions across oﬀspri ng.\nPer Mann, elements of the diathesis including aggressive-\nimpulsive traits, hopelessness, more severe suicidal ideation and\ncognitive inﬂexibility could enhance the individual’s inc reased\nrisk of completed suicide.\nSince it has been proposed that the diathesis component of\nMann’s model follows (at least partially) the laws of heritabi lity,\nwe are suggesting that the diathesis represents genetic fact ors in\na neurobiological model of the capability of suicide.\nEarly life adversities are one of the strongest predictors of\nsuicidal behavior in adulthood (\nSanta Mina and Gallop, 1998 ).\nThe high prevalence of adverse life events in suicidal indivi duals\nhave been conﬁrmed by several sociodemographic studies ( Liu\nand Miller, 2014 ). A crucial question in these studies as well as in\nthe theoretical models is the deﬁnition of “stressful life ev ents”\nor “stress.” An encyclopedia describes these traumatic even ts\nas “rape, combat exposure, sexual, or physical abuse, partner\nviolence or negative life events such as death of family memb er,\ndivorce, loss of child custody, break up with signiﬁcant oth er,\nbullying, verbal abuse, chronic medical/psychiatric problem s\nsuch as physical illness, substance abuse, physical pain, feelin gs of\nhopelessness, and so on” (\nFigley, 2012). Stress per Mann’s model\ncould refer to psychosocial crises as well as development of a\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 74\nLudwig et al. Life Span Model of Suicide\npsychiatric disorder ( Mann, 2003). In other publications “stress”\nmostly refers to early life adversities ( Currier and Mann, 2008;\nMann and Currier, 2010 ). Since this model attempts to combine\ntwo theories and since Joiner’s referencing of stress covers a much\nbroader ﬁeld, the deﬁnition of the factor “stress” will be expa nded\nto “Stress and Trauma” including life events such as combat\nexposure, sexual, or physical abuse over the life span. The stre ss\ncomponent corresponds to the epigenome, life-events like the\nones above mentioned conveying long-lasting marks on genes ,\naﬀecting the risk of suicidal behavior over the life span (\nLabonté\nand Turecki, 2012; Turecki et al., 2012 ).\nThe Interpersonal Theory of Suicide\nThe heart of “The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide” is the idea\nthat the capability to commit suicide is something that has to\nbe acquired throughout the lifespan—being juxtaposed to the\nnatural human survival instinct, which merely presents itse lf\nas the individual’s fear of death. Joiner claims that even in\nsuicidal individuals, who have already acquired a certain l evel\nof capability, it really is a conﬂict between these two contra sting\nfactors. This sort of capability can be acquired by experienci ng\nrepetitive trauma and violence, which can take a wide range of\nforms, from being a combat ﬁghter (\nSelby et al., 2010a; Silva et al.,\n2016) or experiencing proxy-violence and death (as physicians\ndo on a regular basis; Fink-Miller, 2015a,b ) or the experience\nof having attempted suicide or self-harming behavior in eati ng\ndisorders ( Holm-Denoma et al., 2008; Selby et al., 2010b ) to\nbeing responsible for animal euthanasia ( Platt et al., 2010,\n2012). Also personality traits such as impulsivity are thought to\ncontribute to the individual’s capability. The two major fea tures\nof increased level of capability are reduced fear of death and\nincreased threshold of pain tolerance, which are thought to\ninteract with suicidal desire (ideation) and together lead up to\nsuicidal death (\nVan Orden et al., 2010 ). Joiner dissects suicidal\ndesire into two cognitive factors: thwarted belongingness and\nperceived burdensomeness. Thwarted or failed belongingnes s are\nsynonyms for social alienation and loneliness, the experienc e\nof being outside and not part of one’s family and peer group.\nThe theory argues that this feeling of isolation will contrib ute\nvastly to one’s suicidal desire. Perceived burdensomeness is the\nindividual’s perceived conviction of being a burden to their peer\nsystem and family (\nJoiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2012 ).\nWith regard to the proposed model, the capability of\nsuicide can be understood in terms of a spectrum rather\nthan in terms of a dichotomous variable. However, in the\nactual clinical setting, diﬀerentiating suicide ideators a nd\nattempters from death by completed suicide is one of the most\ncrucial tasks. Besides, there is a growing body of evidence\nthat the transition between suicide attempters and death by\ncompleted suicide is not so seamless after all, arguing that\nthey represent distinct entities, and that they carry ﬁrst an d\nforemost distinguishable features (\nGiner et al., 2013; Klonsky\net al., 2016 ).\nWe understand Joiner’s capability of suicide as a profoundly\nbiological concept, comprising factors that have been\nscientiﬁcally assigned to genetics, epigenetics and layer o f\ngene function and gene expression. Factors like impulsivity\nor individual’s aggression threshold have been associated w ith\ngenetic polymorphisms (\nOquendo and Mann, 2000; Oquendo\net al., 2006 ); life time experiences like childhood adversities,\ntrauma ( Yehuda et al., 2016 ), and combat exposure ( Yehuda\net al., 2013; Kaminsky et al., 2015; Sadeh et al., 2016 ) have\nbeen associated with epigenetic changes. Genetic inﬂuence o n\nthe individual’s pain threshold has been conﬂicting ( Eide and\nHole, 1993 ), but an involvement of the serotonin system has\nbeen suggested in multiple publications ( Lindstedt et al., 2012;\nHorjales-Araujo et al., 2013; Schaldemose et al., 2014 ). Exposure\nto suicide has been associated with a higher suicide risk for the\nexposed individuals ( Nanayakkara et al., 2013; Cerel et al., 2016 ),\nbut this factor has not been established from a neurobiologi cal\nperspective (Griﬃths and Hunter, 2014 ).\nTHE LIFE SPAN MODEL OF SUICIDE AND\nITS NEUROBIOLOGICAL FOUNDATION\nIn our proposed merged model ( Figure 1), Mann’s diathesis\nreﬂects the genome of a suicidal individual. Genetic\npolymorphisms of the serotonergic system (\nBach and Arango,\n2012; de Medeiros Alves et al., 2015; Höfer et al., 2016 ),\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ( Fudalej et al., 2015; Yin\net al., 2016 ), noradrenergic system ( Chandley and Ordway,\n2012), and polyamines ( Fiori et al., 2010 ) predispose the\nindividual to suicidal behavior. These predispositions will also\ninteract with the risk of certain psychiatric disorders. Juxta posed\nwith the diathesis of the capability of suicide, there is the\nstress component, which corresponds to the epigenome of the\nindividual. Alterations in the epigenetic landscape reﬂect th e sum\nof noxious stimuli, traumatic events and experiences of deat h\nand pain that increase the capability of suicide throughout th e\nlifespan. In between the genetic layer on the side of the diath esis\nand the epigenetic layer on the side of the stress component,\nwe ﬁnd the gene expression and function, which is thought to\nbe inﬂuenced by both. For example, FKBP5 is a well-known\nsuspect both in suicide research as well as in stress-activati on\nresearch. Functional genetic polymorphisms of FKBP5 are\nknown to change the gene and protein expression levels, which\nmight increase the individual’s vulnerability to stress and might\nincrease the likelihood of stress leaving long-lasting epig enetic\nmarks in the FKBP5 gene. It has been suggested that both the\ngenetic polymorphism and the long-lasting epigenetic mark are\npresent in the phenotypes of psychiatric disorders and suicide\n(\nProvencal and Binder, 2015 ).\nBelow we summarize and discuss the neurobiological ﬁndings\nrelevant to the proposed model. The proposed model is trying to\nmeet the needs for a general suicide model with neurobiologi cal\nfoundation, by acknowledging genetic dispositions, and also\nincluding epigenetic and gene expression ﬁndings. The focus\nis on post-mortem brain studies, since suicide attempters wit h\nunknown intent to die are generally not included in these kin ds\nof studies. Providing a neurobiological foundation to the m erged\nmodels is an attempt of translation—to build bridges between\nstudies of empirical psychology and the latest neurobiologic al\nﬁndings.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 3 February 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 74\nLudwig et al. Life Span Model of Suicide\nFIGURE 1 | The life span model of suicide. The capability of suicide is represented by an arrow directe d toward the completion of suicide, as are two other arrows\nrepresenting thwarted belongingness and perceived burden someness. The capability of suicide is inﬂuenced by genetic, gene expression and epigenetic factors,\nrepresented as layers. The proximity of the Epigenome to Str ess and Trauma and of the Genome to the Diathesis are suggesti ve of their close association.\nGenetics of Suicide\nSuicide is a complex, multifactorial behavior phenotype and\na consequence of interactions of genetics and environment.\nFamily, twin, and adoption studies have supported the genetic\nrisk contribution to the psychopathology of suicide. Statist ically,\nit was estimated that the heritability for suicide approximat ely\nreached 30–55% for suicidal behavior and ideation (\nVoracek\nand Loibl, 2007 ). Here, we are illustrating the genetics of the\ncapability of suicide with candidate gene studies and genome\nwide association studies, which contribute to the diathesi s\ncomponent of the Life Span Model of Suicide. In Mann’s\nmodel, the diathesis is dynamic, whereas our proposed model\nunderstands the diathesis as a rather stable trait correspon ding\nto steady polymorphisms in the genome, not only modifying\nthe susceptibility to traumatic events and stress, but also t he\nvulnerability toward psychiatric disorders or psychosocial crises.\nCandidate Gene Association Studies\nA summary of candidate gene studies are provided in Table 1.\nCandidate genes for suicide are primarily found in the\nserotonergic system, dopaminergic system, and brain-deriv ed\nneurotrophic factor (BDNF). Studies suggest that low CSF lev els\nof 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the main metaboli te\nof serotonin (5-HT), were associated with increased aggres sive\nbehavior, impulsiveness and a higher risk of suicide attempts\n(\nAsberg et al., 1976; Linnoila and Virkkunen, 1992; Perroud\net al., 2010 ). The alteration of serotonergic function has been\ndemonstrated to correlate with the etiology and pathogenesi s\nof suicidal behavior. The tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) gene,\na rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of 5-HT, is invol ved\nin the dysfunction of the 5-HT system (\nCooper and Melcer,\n1961). Two diﬀerent genes code for TPH: TPH1 and TPH2.\nBoth are major candidate genes for psychiatric and behaviora l\ndisorders, in particular for mood disorders and suicidal beha vior.\nTurecki et al. (2001) genotyped the A218C loci of the TPH1\ngene in a sample of 101 suicide victims and 129 controls from\nthe Canadian population. Although, the single loci analysis\nshowed no diﬀerence between the two groups, haplotype analysis\nwas signiﬁcantly associated with suicide behavior (\nTurecki\net al., 2001 ). Within another Canadian postmortem sample,\nno signiﬁcant diﬀerence between suicide victims and control s\nregarding the TPH gene 218A/C polymorphism were found ( Du\net al., 2000 ). Furthermore, three studies with Croatian samples\nfocused on the same polymorphism ( Jernej et al., 2004; Stefulj\net al., 2005, 2006 ). Interestingly, the results demonstrated that\nthe TPH gene has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on suicidality ( Jernej\net al., 2004; Stefulj et al., 2006 ). A case-control study with 572\nsuicide victims and 1049 healthy controls in Denmark attempt ed\nto conﬁrm the association of TPH1 and TPH2 with suicide.\nIn the basic association test, the loci frequency of SNPs in\nthe TPH1 and TPH2 showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between\nthe sample that died of suicide and the sample that died of\nother reasons. However, further analyses showed that TPH1\npolymorphism rs1800532 might have a protective eﬀect for\nspeciﬁc populations including younger males and rs1800532\nmight be a predictive risk factor in elderly male subjects\n(\nButtenschø et al., 2013 ). This ﬁnding raises the important\nquestion whether rs1800532 has a diﬀerential role in young\nvs. adult population. More mechanistic studies need to be\nperformed. Also, these ﬁndings should be further explored in a\nlarger population as well as in other cohorts of subjects.\nRoy et al.\n(2001) found the TPH A779C allele frequency to be higher in the\nliving MZ twins of suicide victims than in controls. No signiﬁ cant\ndiﬀerences in polymorphisms of A218C or A779C were found\nin a Japanese sample (\nOno et al., 2000; Ohtani et al., 2004 ).\nRecently, a meta-analysis reviewed more than 30 publications\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 4 February 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 74\nLudwig et al.

The meta-\nanalysis of TPH1 included 5,683 cases and 11,652 controls.\nThe results demonstrated that the polymorphisms rs1800532\n(A218C) and rs1799913 (A779C) were associated with suicida l\nbehavior. Three SNPs (rs4570625/G-703 T, rs11178997/A-47 3 T,\nand rs1386494/G19918A) in TPH2 gene were investigated in a\nsample of 4,196 cases and 5,990 controls. No signiﬁcant resul ts\nwere detected suggesting that TPH2 might not play a signiﬁcan t\nrole in suicidal behavior (\nGonzález-Castro et al., 2014 ). Stefulj\net al. (2011) conducted an association study in 291 subjects who\ndied of suicide and 280 subjects who died of other causes and\nfound no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the distribution of the TPH 2\npolymorphism G-703 T between the two groups (\nStefulj et al.,\n2011).\nThe gene coding for 5HTT (SLC6A4, 37.8 kb at 17q11.1–\nq12) is another widely studied candidate gene for suicide.\nAn insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region\ncontains two or three alleles called short (s) and long (IA an d\nIG).\nBondy et al. (2000a) were the ﬁrst to ﬁnd a highly signiﬁcant\nincreased frequency of suicide victims being carriers of on e\nor two short alleles. These positive associated results ( Bondy\net al., 2000a ) were replicated by two other studies ( Courtet\net al., 2004; Lopez de Lara et al., 2006 ). Anguelova et al. (2003)\nperformed a meta-analysis, pooling 12 studies with a focus on\nthe 5-HTT promoter polymorphism. A total of 1,168 cases\n(suicide victims and attempters) and 1,371 controls (includ ing\nCaucasian US and Chinese population) were analyzed, and a\nsigniﬁcant association of the s allele with suicidal behavi or\nwas demonstrated (\nAnguelova et al., 2003 ). A recent meta-\nanalysis including 2,536 cases and 3,984 controls also suppor ted\nthe association of the 5-HTTLPR in suicidal behavior ( Schild\net al., 2013 ). Clayden et al. (2012) conducted a sub-analysis for\nsuicide completers including 6 studies with a total of 860 sui cide\nvictims and 1,234 healthy controls. No signiﬁcant associat ion\nbetween the suicide risk and the short polymorphism of HTTLPR\ncould be established. However, the rs1800532 polymorphism wa s\nsigniﬁcantly associated with a higher risk for suicide atte mpts\n(\nClayden et al., 2012 ). Compared with the sample size of suicide\nattempters, the number of suicide victims was relatively sma ller,\nwhich might have caused a loss of signiﬁcance in a number\nof studies. Taken together, these studies provide evidence t hat\n5-HTTLPR may play a crucial role in suicidal behavior.\nBDNF, a member of the neurotrophin family of growth\nfactors, is also a promising candidate gene for suicide behav ior\n(\nDwivedi, 2012 ). Among the SNPs within the region of BDNF,\nthe Val66Met (rs6265) has received the most attention in gene tic\nstudies of suicide. This polymorphism is a missense mutation at\nposition 66 resulting in a valine to methionine substitution . A\nsigniﬁcant association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism\nand suicidal behavior could be shown in several studies (\nIga\net al., 2007; Zai et al., 2012 ). González-Castro et al. (2015)\nfound an association between genotype Val-Val and suicide\nattempts in bipolar patients.\nPregelj et al. (2011) investigated\nthe BDNF Val66Met polymorphism in whole blood collected\nduring autopsy of 359 suicide victims and 201 controls. A\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerence in the frequency of the Met genotype was\nfound between female suicide victims and female control gro up.\nAdditionally, the Met/Met genotypes of BDNF Val66Met could\npredict the risk of dying by suicide in female subjects with\nviolent and childhood trauma (\nPregelj et al., 2011 ). Recently,\nRatta-Apha et al. (2013) explored the association between BDNF\npolymorphisms with suicide. The Met-allele was shown to be\nassociated with attempted suicide, but not with death by suic ide\n(\nRatta-Apha et al., 2013 ).\nGenome-Wide Association Studies of Suicidal\nBehavior\nGenome-wide association study (GWAS) provides a powerful\ntool for analyzing more than one million single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) at a time. This approach has been\napplied in identifying novel genes in suicide research. To dat e,\nnine original GWAS studies have been performed to test for\nassociation with suicidal behavior (\nLaje et al., 2009; Perlis et al.,\n2010; Schosser et al., 2011; Menke et al., 2012; Perroud et al. ,\n2012; Willour et al., 2012; Galfalvy et al., 2013, 2015; Mullins et al.,\n2014) which are all listed in Table 2.

Among those\ntop associated SNPs, 22 SNPs were located within 19 genes\nwhose functions were already known. Gene expression analysis\nfound that nine of those 19 genes were altered in the prefronta l\ncortex of suicide victims, including CD44, FOXN3, DSC2, and\nCD300LB (\nGalfalvy et al., 2013 ). A very recent GWAS study\nwas conducted with a mixed sample of suicide attempters,\nsuicide victims ( n = 577) and healthy controls ( n = 1233).\nDue to smaller eﬀect sizes, no variants reached genome-wide\nsigniﬁcance. Notably, several SNPs within ADAMTS14 and\nPSME2 (both linked to inﬂammatory response), STK3 (neuronal\ncell death), and TBX20 (brainstem motor neuron development)\nwere ranked as candidate genes for further analyses (\nGalfalvy\net al., 2015 ). Willour et al. (2012) conducted a GWAS study and\ncompared the SNPs between 1201 bipolar subjects with and 1497\nbipolar subjects without history of suicide attempts. 2507 SN Ps\nwere identiﬁed with an evidence for association at P < 0.001.\nThese associated SNPs were subsequently tested for associa tion\nin a large and independent bipolar sample, but no signiﬁcant\nassociations could be established after correcting for mul tiple\ntesting (\nWillour et al., 2012 ).\nOverall only a few of these GWAS studies presented signiﬁcant\ndata after correction for multiple testing, however they do s uggest\ninteresting candidate genes that may be worthwhile to follo w\nup in future studies. We could speculate that individual genet ic\nsusceptibility factors for suicide are likely to have only min or\neﬀects and very large pooled analyses of cases and controls wil l\nbe necessary to identify them.\nEpigenetics of Suicide\nEpigenetic regulation is heritable and known to inﬂuence gen e\nfunction by diﬀerent biochemical modiﬁcations other than\naltering the DNA sequence (\nEccleston et al., 2007 ). Despite\ntheir close association with disease pathophysiology and acti ve\nparticipation in regulating developmental pathways ( Portela\nand Esteller, 2010; Cantone and Fisher, 2013 ), epigenetic\nmodiﬁcation is a relatively new concept in suicide neurobiol ogy\n(El-Sayed et al., 2012 ).\nDNA methylation based epigenetic modiﬁcations confer\nsilencing in gene expression involving a covalent attachmen t of\na methyl group to cytosine residues ( Moore et al., 2013 ). This\nwas found to be true for a wide spectrum of genes, for pathways\nincluding the γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission,\nHPA axis related stress response system and the polyamine\nsystem of the suicide brain (\nTurecki, 2014a ). Part of this DNA\nmethylation process also involves the neurotropic system ( Duclot\nand Kabbaj, 2015 ). A summary of these methylation-based\nstudies is provided in Table 3.\nEvidence from the GABAergic system has shown deﬁciency\nin GABAA α 1 receptor subunit expression in the frontal cortex\nof suicide victims ( Klempan et al., 2009; Poulter et al., 2010 )\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 6 February 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 74\nLudwig et al.

An overall change in methylation pattern\nwas identiﬁed in the SAT1 promoter region of 10 suicide\ncompleters, which included three highly polymorphic sites (\nFiori\nand Turecki, 2011 ). In agreement with the hypothesis, a strong\nnegative correlation was noted between the overall promoter\nmethylation and SAT1 gene transcription. As mentioned above ,\nthe presence of three highly polymorphic sites (rs6526342,\nrs928931, and rs1960264) on SAT1 promoter added an additiona l\nlayer of haplotype speciﬁc gene regulation driven by DNA\nmethylation. Amongst the three sites, rs6526342 showed\nmethylation enrichment in the suicide group albeit no signi ﬁcant\ncorrelation with SAT1 expression. The frequent occurrence o f\na hypermethylated “C” allele in suicide subjects was conside red\nto be associated with downregulated SAT1 expression (\nFiori and\nTurecki, 2011 ). A possible explanation might be an inaccessible\nDNA structure aﬀecting the binding of potential transcription\ninducers (NF-E2, YY1, and AP-1) with the SAT1 gene promoter\n(\nFiori and Turecki, 2011 ).\nStudies of additional polyamine related genes such as\nornithine decarboxylase antizymes 1 and 2 (OAZ1 and OAZ2),\nAMD1 and arginase 2 (ARG2) show expression upregulation\n(\nGross et al., 2013; Limon et al., 2016 ). Interestingly, the\nhyperfunctional status for all four genes was found to be\nassociated with promoter hypomethylation. Contrary to the\noverall methylation status, site speciﬁc CpG hypomethylation\non AMD1 (CpG9, CpG16) and ARG2 (CpG5-7 and CpG42-\n44) promoters were found to be highly signiﬁcant in suicide\nvictims. This hypomethylation status was further supported by\nthe signiﬁcant negative correlation between two speciﬁc CpG\nsites (CpG9 and 16) and AMD1 gene expression whereas CpG5-\n7 was found to be negatively correlated with gain of function\nof ARG2 gene. This was not found to be true for OAZ1 and\nOAZ2 genes, although site-speciﬁc as well as overall diﬀerence s\nin methylation between controls and suicide victims were no ticed\nfor all four genes investigated (\nGross et al., 2013 ).\nAn interesting observation on lower BDNF expression was\nnoted in suicide victims ( Dwivedi et al., 2003a; Banerjee et al.,\n2013) with concomitant change in BDNF exon IV based\nmethylation status ( Keller et al., 2010 ). Analysis of four CpG sites\n(+10, +16, +25, and +28) of BDNF exon IV in the Wernicke’s\narea identiﬁed a signiﬁcant mean methylation diﬀerence betwe en\nsuicide and non-suicide subjects ( Keller et al., 2010 ). Following\nthe same pattern, analysis of methylation diﬀerence for individ ual\nCpG sites on exon IV indicated a signiﬁcant correlation betwe en\nsuicidal behavior and the hypermethylation status of two CpG\nsite ( +10 and +25). Moreover, lower expression of BDNF gene\nwas noticed in those suicide subjects who had earlier shown\nexon IV promoter hypermethylation (\nKeller et al., 2010 ). These\nobservations suggest that epigenetic inﬂuence on neurotroph ic\ndeﬁciency results in improper modulation of neural plasticity\n(\nDwivedi, 2009; Duclot and Kabbaj, 2015 ), a common ﬁnding in\nsuicide brains ( Dwivedi et al., 2005 ).\nDNA based methylation in dysregulating gene function\nwas further evidenced from studies in astrocytes of suicide\nsubjects (\nMaussion et al., 2014; Nagy et al., 2015 ). These\nstudies identiﬁed three potential hypermethylated sites on\n3′untranslated region (UTR) of TRKB gene in suicide victims,\nwhich showed 3 ′ UTR-mediated epigenetic regulation on\ncompromised TRKB.T1 isoform expression (\nMaussion et al.,\n2014). Structural characterization of TRKB.T1 3 ′UTR indicated\nthe presence of four CpG sites (CpG6–CpG9) within a\nspan of 150 base pairs. Methylation analysis of these four\nCpG sites showed signiﬁcant methylation enrichment in the\nsuicide group compared to the control group; additional\nstatistical analysis established a signiﬁcant correlation between\nmethylation and expression levels. Contrary to this, earlie r\nreports on decreased TRKB.T1 expression has shown a\ndiﬀerent mechanism of DNA methylation mediated regulation\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 7 February 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 74\nLudwig et al. Life Span Model of Suicide\nin BA 8/9 of suicide subjects which involved two speciﬁc\nhypermethylated CpG sites on TRKB promoter (\nErnst et al.,\n2009).\nAddressing the epigenetic inﬂuence on suicide neurobiology\nremains incomplete without discussing the functional\ninvolvement of the HPA axis. In a postmortem brain\nexpression and methylation study, hippocampal NR3C1\nexpression was found to be signiﬁcantly decreased in 12\nsuicide victims. Interestingly, DNA methylation analysis\n(promoter NR3C1 exon 1F) was found to be closely associated\nwith childhood adversity (\nMcGowan et al., 2009 ). A recent\nreport has identiﬁed similar site-speciﬁc DNA methylation\nchanges related to three non-coding glucocorticoid (GR)\ntranscript variants (1 B, I C, and 1 H) in hippocampal regions\nof suicide victims with a history of childhood abuse\n(\nLabonte et al., 2012 ). This indicates an integral role of\ncoordinated DNA methylation response to alter the GR\nfunctionality, resulting in HPA axis dysregulation in suic ide\nsubjects.\nTaken together, the studies discussed herein suggest the\nfunctional implication of DNA methylation based epigenetic\nmodiﬁcations in dysregulating multiple cellular pathways in\nbrain areas primarily involved in neurocognitive and vegeta tive\nfunctions. These cellular abnormalities may give rise to an overall\ndysfunctional state in information processing and may event ually\ncontribute to the individual’s capability of suicide (\nTurecki,\n2014b).\nGene Expression and Function\nPostmortem ﬁndings of gene expression and gene function\nstudies point to a hyperactivation of the HPA-system, a\ndownregulated serotonin system and decreased levels of BDN F\ncompared to non-psychiatric control subjects or psychiatric\npatients who died of reasons other than suicide. In this revie w,\nwe are focusing primarily on postmortem brain studies, since\nthe reliability and the validity of peripheral biomarkers has\nbeen questioned before (\nBlasco-Fontecilla et al., 2013; Niculescu\net al., 2015; The Lancet, 2016 ) and suicide attempters might also\nconfound the variable we are attempting to deﬁne: the capabili ty\nof suicide ( Table 4).\nSeveral early studies investigated the association between\nthe HPA-axis and suicide by autoradiographic and ligand\nbinding techniques, describing an overexpression of CRH and\na subsequent downregulation of the corresponding receptors\n(\nNemeroﬀ et al., 1988; Merali et al., 2006 ). Studies focusing\non molecular gene expression in post-mortem samples of\nsuicide victims show a similar picture: downregulated CRHR1\nreceptor (not CRHR2) (\nMerali et al., 2004 ), increased pro-\nopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA but no diﬀerence in GR\n(glucocorticoid receptor) mRNA (\nLópez et al., 1992 ); no\ndiﬀerence between the expression levels of CRHR1 and CRHR2,\nbut a diﬀerence in the CRHR1/CRHR2-ratio (\nHiroi et al.,\n2001) compared to control subjects. More recent studies found\nsigniﬁcantly decreased GR- α protein and mRNA expression in\nteenage suicide victims’ amygdala and PFC ( Pandey et al., 2013 ),\nTABLE 4 | Gene expression ﬁndings in postmortem suicide brain s.\nSystem Findings Brain region Gene References\nHPA Axis Downregulation PFC CRHR1 Merali et al., 2004\nUpregulation PFC, ACC CRH Zhao et al., 2015\nDownregulation PFC, amygdala GR-alpha Pandey et al., 2013; Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2013\nDownregulation amygdala FKBP5 Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2013\nUpregulation Pituitary POMC López et al., 1992\nSerotonergic Upregulation Cortex, hippocampus 5HT2A Stanley and Mann, 1983; Turecki et al., 1999;\nPandey et al., 2002; Escribá et al., 2004\nUpregulation of edited isoform of pre-mRNA PFC 5HT2C Niswender et al., 2001; Lyddon et al., 2013; Di\nNarzo et al., 2014\nNoradrenergic Upregulation Locus coeruleus TH Pandey and Dwivedi, 2007\nUpregulation PFC α 2 adrenergic receptor Pandey and Dwivedi, 2007\nInconclusive data PFC β 2 adrenergic receptor Pandey and Dwivedi, 2007\nUpregulation Cortex COMT Du et al., 2014\nNeurotrophins Downregulation PFC, hippocampus BDNF Dwivedi et al., 2003a; Banerjee et al., 2013; Du\net al., 2014\nDownregulation Hippocampus NGF Banerjee et al., 2013\nDownregulation PFC, hippocampus TRKB Dwivedi et al., 2003a; Ernst et al., 2009;\nBanerjee et al., 2013\nDownregulation hippocampus TRKA Banerjee et al., 2013\nDownregulation PFC, hippocampus PI-3 Dwivedi et al., 2008\nDownregulation PFC, hippocampus CREB Dwivedi et al., 2003b; Pandey et al., 2007\nPFC, prefrontal cortex; ACC, anterior cingulate cortex.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 74\nLudwig et al. Life Span Model of Suicide\nand signiﬁcantly reduced protein and mRNA expression levels of\nGR and FKBP5 in the amygdala of suicide victims (\nPérez-Ortiz\net al., 2013 ).\nA very recent study examined postmortem transcription levels\nin depressed suicide victims, depressed subjects who died fro m\nnon-suicidal causes, and subjects without any psychiatric h istory.\nInterestingly, depressed suicide victims carried a distinc tive\ntranscription proﬁle, diﬀerent from prior ﬁndings: CRH mRNA\nwas signiﬁcantly increased in the suicide group, CRHR1 and\nGR failed to show signiﬁcance but were upregulated compared\nto the other two groups and CRHR2 showed an insigniﬁcant\ndownregulation (\nZhao et al., 2015 ).\nThe abundant serotonin receptor 5HT 2A has been the focus\nof neurobiological suicide studies for a long time. The majo rity\nof publications reported an increased level of 5HT 2A receptors\nin the cortical area of suicide victims ( Stanley and Mann, 1983;\nTurecki et al., 1999; Escribá et al., 2004 ); mRNA expression\nseems to be increased in the hippocampus area as well ( Pandey\net al., 2002 ). A recent study found no signiﬁcant changes of\nmonoamine-related genes (5HTA1, 5HT2A, MAOA, MAOB)\nin a group of MDD-suicide subjects compared to non-suicidal\nMDD subjects and controls without any psychiatric history\n(\nZhao et al., 2015 ). Of all 14 serotonin receptors, 5HT2C is one\nof the less examined ones: Pandey et al. compared its mRNA and\nprotein expression in the PFC, hippocampus, and choroid plexus\nbetween suicide victims and normal control subjects. They f ound\nno signiﬁcant diﬀerences in mRNA expression levels, but higher\nlevels of protein in the PFC of suicide victims (\nPandey et al.,\n2006). Recent publications suggest that a highly edited isoform\nof the pre-mRNA of serotonin receptor 2C is overrepresented\nin the brains of suicide victims and is signiﬁcantly correla ted to\ngene expression levels of associated genes (\nNiswender et al., 2001;\nLyddon et al., 2013; Di Narzo et al., 2014 ).\nA few studies investigating the noradrenergic system in\npostmortem brain samples of suicide victims demonstrated\nincreased norepinephrine enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) a nd\nincreased α 2- and β 2-adrenergic receptors (\nPandey and Dwivedi,\n2007). As for catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), there was\nonly one gene expression study that reported signiﬁcantly\nincreased COMT mRNA in cortex areas of depressed suicide\nvictims (\nDu et al., 2014 ).\nIn line with functional polymorphisms found in\npostmortem brain samples of suicide victims, BDNF also\nshows corresponding changes in gene expression and gene\nfunction. Generally speaking, most of the studies were able t o\nﬁnd suicide-speciﬁc eﬀects, which did not correlate with any\nunderlying condition or psychiatric disorder (\nDwivedi, 2010 ).\nA signiﬁcant decrease in both BDNF gene expression and\ncorresponding protein expression has been reported in PFC and\nhippocampus (\nDwivedi et al., 2003a ). Decreased gene expression\nin the hippocampus and PFC but not in the entorhinal cortex\nhave been presented by\nKarege et al. (2005) . The expression\nof other neurotrophins such as NGF, NT-3, NT-4/5 has been\ndescribed as decreased as well (\nDwivedi et al., 2005; Karege\net al., 2005 ). A recent study comparing depressed subjects to\nsuicide subjects and controls: BDNF and its receptors showed\na merely insigniﬁcant upregulation in the suicide group (\nZhao\net al., 2015 ). Reduced neurotrophins (BDNF and NGF) as\nwell as reduced receptor (TRKB, TRKA) mRNA and protein\nexpression were found in the hippocampus of a sample of suicide\nvictims, compared with a sample of controls who died of other\ncauses (\nBanerjee et al., 2013 ). Decreased receptor expression of\nTRKB in suicide victims has also been reported in several other\nstudies in hippocampus (\nDwivedi et al., 2003a ) and prefrontal\ncortex ( Dwivedi et al., 2003a; Ernst et al., 2009 ), incongruent\nresults have been reported for the Wernicke area ( Keller et al.,\n2011; Zarrilli et al., 2014 ). In line with the above mentioned\nﬁndings, phosphoinositide 3 (PI 3)-kinase, a key enzyme in the\nneurotrophin pathway, was found to be decreased in PFC and\nhippocampus of suicide victims (both mRNA and protein levels;\nDwivedi et al., 2008 ).\nCyclic-AMP response element binding (CREB) is an\nimportant transcription factor that interacts with promoters\nof genes involved in neuronal signaling (\nSheng et al., 1990 ).\nIts association with BDNF in particular ( Finkbeiner, 2000 )\nmakes CREB an interesting candidate for suicide studies.\nEarlier studies found decreased immunoreactivities of both\nCREB and phosphorylated CREB (\nYamada et al., 2003 ),\ndecreased expression of CREB in postmortem brains of\ndrug-free MDD-patients (\nYuan et al., 2010 ) and decreased\nCREB protein expression in neutrophils of drug-free MDD\npatients (\nRen et al., 2011 ). Irrespective of the diagnosis, CREB\nmRNA and protein expression were found to be signiﬁcantly\ndecreased in the PFC and hippocampus of suicide victims,\ncompared to subjects without any psychiatric history (\nDwivedi\net al., 2003b ). In a sample of teenage suicide victims, these\nﬁndings were replicated in the PFC only ( Pandey et al.,\n2007).\nTaken together, these ﬁndings indicate that changes in the\nserotonin and the neurotrophin system as well as changes in the\nHPA axis and CREB are contributing to the capability of suicide\non the level of gene expression.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWhen addressing suicide in the form of a model—as inclusive\nas it can be—many factors unavoidably will be left out. Suici de\nis a heterogeneous disorder and every suicidal act is unique in\nits causes, forms and intentions. Causes (usually a psychiat ric\ndisorder) and intentions might inﬂuence the method used\n(violent vs. non-violent) and a method could inﬂuence the\noutcome. All these diﬀerences make it diﬃcult to address\nsuicide in the form of a model. Nevertheless, suicide models\nare indispensable for an on-going scientiﬁc dialogue as well\nas for the purpose of education. This review is an attempt to\nconstruct a combined model of Mann’s Stress-Diathesis and\nJoiner’s Interpersonal Theory, describing suicide as a total of\ncognitive and neurobiological features. The focus of the Li fe\nSpan Model is on established neurobiological ﬁndings that\nsupport the presence of a capability of suicide, represented\nboth by predisposing factors (“diathesis”) and contributing\nfactors (“stress and trauma”). Predisposing factors, incre asing\nthe vulnerability of an individual might be found in the\nFrontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 9 February 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 74\nLudwig et al. Life Span Model of Suicide\ngenetic code. These genetic variations might further incre ase\nthe individual’s vulnerability to post-transcriptional and post-\ntranslational changes resulting from traumatic experience s and\nstress throughout the lifespan. Hence, although our model\nplaces genetics of suicide close to Mann’s “diathesis, ” and\nepigenetic changes close to “stress and trauma, ” the likelih ood\nof in-between interactions cannot be denied. This brings us\nto the point that the graphic depiction of this model is a\nsimpliﬁcation of our current knowledge about the neurobiolo gy\nof suicide, albeit true with psychological models too. We\nclaim that there is a need for translational theories that ha ve\nthe capability of reaching practicing clinicians and scienti sts,\nand contribute to mental health education in general. With\npsychiatric research in particular, there is a necessity for\nestablished models to which greater audiences can relate. F urther\nresearch, particularly epigenetic studies, is needed to suppor t the\npresence of a life-long, evolving capability of suicide and id entify\nneurobiological correlates of susceptibility as well as prot ective\nfactors.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nEach author contributed substantially in preparing the\nmanuscript.
