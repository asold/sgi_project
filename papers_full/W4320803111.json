  "abstract": "Abstract Today, most of the large‐scale conversational AI agents such as Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant are built using manually annotated data to train the different components of the system including automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language understanding (NLU), and entity resolution (ER). Typically, the accuracy of the machine learning models in these components are improved by manually transcribing and annotating data. As the scope of these systems increase to cover more scenarios and domains, manual annotation to improve the accuracy of these components becomes prohibitively costly and time consuming. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages customer/system interaction feedback signals to automate learning without any manual annotation. Users of these systems tend to modify a previous query in hopes of fixing an error in the previous turn to get the right results. These reformulations, which are often preceded by defective experiences caused by either errors in ASR, NLU, ER, or the application. In some cases, users may not properly formulate their requests (e.g., providing partial title of a song), but gleaning across a wider pool of users and sessions reveals the underlying recurrent patterns. Our proposed self‐learning system automatically detects the errors, generates reformulations, and deploys fixes to the runtime system to correct different types of errors occurring in different components of the system. In particular, we propose leveraging an absorbing Markov Chain model as a collaborative filtering mechanism in a novel attempt to mine these patterns, and coupling it with a guardrail rewrite selection mechanism that reactively evaluates these fixes using feedback friction data. We show that our approach is highly scalable, and able to learn reformulations that reduce Alexa‐user errors by pooling anonymized data across millions of customers. The proposed self‐learning system achieves a win‐loss ratio of 11.8 and effectively reduces the defect rate by more than 30 percent on utterance level reformulations in our production A/B tests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self‐learning large‐scale conversational AI system in production.",

This is also: (1) not a scalable solution, since it\nneedsalotofannotations,and(2)itisexpensiveandtime\nconsumingtoupdatethosemodels.Instead,wehavetaken\na “query rewriting” approach to solve customer frictions,\nmeaningthatwhennecessary,wereformulateacustomer’s\nquery such that it conveys the same meaning/intent, and\nis actionable (i.e., interpretable) by Alexa’s existing NLU\nsystems.\nInmotivatingourapproach,considertheexampleutter-\nance, “play maj and dragons.” Now, without reformula-\ntion, Alexa would inevitably come up with the response,\n“Sorry,Icouldn’tfindmajanddragons .”Somecustomers\ngiveupatthispoint,whileothersmaytryenunciatingbet-\nterforAlexatounderstandthem:“ playimaginedragons.”\nAlso note that there might be other customers who give\nupandchangethenextquerytoanotherintent,forexam-\nple: “playpopmusic.” Here, frictions evidently cause dis-\nsatisfactionwithdifferentcustomersreactingdifferentlyto\nthem. However, quite clearly there are good rephrases by\nsomecustomersamongalltheseinteractions,whichbeck-\nons the question – how can we identify and extract them\ntosolvecustomerfrictions?\nWe propose using a Markov-based collaborative filter-\ning approach to identify rewrites that lead to success-\nful customer interactions. We go on to discuss the the-\nory and implementation of the idea, as well as show that\nthis method is highly scalable and effective in signifi-\ncantly reducing customer frictions.

This primarily includes events where users opt to\ninterrupt Alexa by means of an interjecting utterance (as\ndefinedaboveinDataset).Thisisillustratedintheexample\nbelow:\nUser: “playalever”\nAlexa: “Here’sLeverbyTheMavis’s,startingnow.”\nUser: “stop”\nIncontrast, implicitfeedback istypicallyobservedwhen\nusers abandon a session following Alexa’s failure to han-\ndlearequesteitherduetoaninternalexceptionorsimply\nunable to find a match for the entities resolved.

Additionally, the sub-matrices0 and 𝐈2 both\nAIMAGAZINE 49\nrepresent the sub-matrix of zeros and the2×2 identity\nmatrix,respectively.\nNow, we generalize the previous notation of probabili-\ntiesas 𝑃(𝑛),thatis,theprobabilityatdepth-𝑛 ofthegraph,\nwith 𝑃 implicitly referring to𝑃(1). Note that in the con-\ntext of transition probabilities, this generalization readily\nextends to the matrix form where the probability of tran-\nsitioning from some transient stateℎ\n𝑖 to some transient\nstate ℎ𝑗 after exactly𝑛 steps, that is,𝑃(𝑛)(ℎ𝑗|ℎ𝑖) is thus\ngivenbythe (𝑖,𝑗)-thelementofthesub-matrix 𝐐𝑛 (i.e.,𝐐\nmultiplied itself𝑛times) and similarly as before with𝐐𝑖,𝑗\nimplicitlyreferringto 𝑃(ℎ𝑗|ℎ𝑖).Additionally,let ℎ𝑠 andℎ𝑡\nbeanygivensourceandtargettransientstatesinthegraph,\nrespectively.

Given this, we can thus define the\nprobabilityof successaftertraversingfromanygiven ℎ𝑠 to\nanygiven ℎ𝑡 suchthat ℎ𝑡 isreachablebyℎ𝑠 asfollows:\n𝛑∞ (ℎ𝑠 →ℎ 𝑡) =𝑃\n(\n𝑟+|ℎ𝑡\n)\n⋅𝐍 𝑠,𝑡 (7)\nAs such, in the context of reducing defects, we con-\nsiderℎ𝑡 to be a possible reformulation candidate forℎ𝑠 if\nitis reachablebyℎ𝑠,suchthatconditionedon ℎ𝑠,ℎ𝑡 hasa\nhigherchanceof successthanℎ𝑠 onitsown,thatis:\n𝛑∞ (ℎ𝑠 →ℎ 𝑡) >𝑃\n(\n𝑟+|ℎ𝑠\n)\n(8)\nWethenframeourobjectiveasidentifyingthe ℎ𝑡 which\nmaximizestheaforementionedprobabilityforthegiven ℎ𝑠:\nℎ∗\n𝑡 =a r g m a x\nℎ𝑡\n𝛑∞ (ℎ𝑠 →ℎ 𝑡) (9)\nIntuitivelyspeaking,intheeventthat ℎ∗\n𝑡 ≠ ℎ𝑠,themodel\nshows that there exists areachable target interpretation\nthat when reformulated fromℎ𝑠, has a better chance at\na successfulexperience than not doing so.

Another important difference\nbetween the graph and the pointer-generator method is\nthatthegraphiscapableofidentifyingwhenanutterance\nis successful via its interpretation, that is, whenℎ\n∗\n𝑡 =ℎ 𝑠\nand thus maximize its precision.

It is clear from the examples that the\nrewrites are capable of fixing ASR (no. 1–3), NLU (no. 4–\n7), and even user errors (no. 8). On the other hand, there\nare cases where the rewrites tend to fail (no. 9–10).

In fact, extending from the previous\nsection, while high path entropy leading to overly gener-\nalized utterances is a cause of concern, the greater req-\nuisite for a rewrite selection mechanism stems from the\nlatter issue of intent changes in the proposed rewrite,\nwhich is largely prompted by the unavailability of more\nrecent content requested by the original utterance.
