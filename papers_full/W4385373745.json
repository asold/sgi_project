Publication date: March 2024.\narXiv:2307.14385v4  [cs.CL]  28 Jan 2024\n32:2 • Xu et al.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe recent surge of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 [ 18], PaLM [23], FLAN-T5 [24], and Al-\npaca [115], demonstrates the promising capability of large pre-trained models to solve various tasks in zero-shot\nsettings (i.e., tasks not encountered during training). Example tasks include question answering [87, 100], logic\nreasoning [124, 135], machine translation [15, 45], etc. A number of experiments have revealed that, built on\nhundreds of billions of parameters, these LLMs have started to show the capability to understand the human\ncommon sense beneath the natural language and do proper reasoning and inference accordingly [18, 85].\nAmong different applications, one particular question yet to be answered is how well LLMs can understand\nhuman mental health states through natural language. Mental health problems represent a significant burden for\nindividuals and societies worldwide. A recent report suggested that more than 20% of adults in the U.S. experience\nat least one mental disorder in their lifetime [9] and 5.6% have suffered from a serious psychotic disorder that\nsignificantly impairs functioning [3]. The global economy loses around $1 trillion annually in productivity due to\ndepression and anxiety alone [2].\nIn the past decade, there has been a plethora of research in natural language processing (NLP) and computational\nsocial science on detecting mental health issues via online text data such as social media content (e.g., [26, 32, 33,\n38, 47]). However, most of these studies have focused on building domain-specific machine learning (ML) models\n(i.e., one model for one particular task, such as stress detection [46, 84], depression prediction [38, 113, 127, 128],\nor suicide risk assessment [28, 35]). Even for traditional pre-trained language models such as BERT, they need to\nbe finetuned for specific downstream tasks [37, 72]. Some studies have also explored the multi-task setup [12],\nsuch as predicting depression and anxiety at the same time [ 106]. However, these models are constrained to\npredetermined task sets, offering limited flexibility. From a different aspect, another line of research has been\nexploring the application of chatbots for mental health services [20, 21, 68]. Most chatbots are simply rule-based\nand can benefit from more advanced models that empower the chatbots [4, 68]. Despite the growing research\nefforts of empowering AI for mental health, it’s important to note that existing techniques can sometimes\nintroduce bias and even provide harmful advice to users [54, 74, 116].\nSince natural language is a major component of mental health assessment and treatment [ 43, 110], LLMs\ncould be a powerful tool for understanding end-users’ mental states through their written language. These\ninstruction-finetuned and general-purpose models can understand a variety of inputs and obviate the need to\ntrain multiple models for different tasks. Thus, we envision employing a single LLM for a variety of mental\nhealth-related tasks, such as multiple question-answering, reasoning, and inference. This vision opens up a wide\nrange of opportunities for UbiComp, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and mental health communities, such\nas online public health monitoring systems [44, 90], mental-health-aware personal chatbots [5, 36, 63], intelligent\nassistants for mental health therapists [108], online moderation tools [39], daily mental health counselors and\nsupporters [109], etc. However, there is a lack of investigation into understanding, evaluating, and improving the\ncapability of LLMs for mental-health-related tasks.\nThere are few recent studies on the evaluation of LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) on mental-health-related tasks, most of\nwhich are in zero-shot settings with simple prompt engineering [10, 67, 132]. Researchers have shown preliminary\nresults that LLMs have the initial capability of predicting mental health disorders using natural language, with\npromising but still limited performance compared to state-of-the-art domain-specific NLP models [67, 132]. This\nremaining gap is expected since existing general-purpose LLMs are not specifically trained on mental health\ntasks. However, to achieve our vision of leveraging LLMs for mental health support and assistance, we need to\naddress the research question: How to improve LLMs’ capability of mental health tasks ?\nWe conducted a series of experiments with six LLMs, including Alpaca [115] and Alpaca-LoRA (LoRA-finetuned\nLLaMA on Alpaca dataset) [51], which are representative open-source models focused on dialogue and other\ntasks; FLAN-T5 [24], a representative open-source model focused on task-solving; LLaMA2 [ 118], one of the\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\nMental-LLM • 32:3\nmost advanced open-source model released by Meta; GPT-3.5 [1] and GPT-4 [18], representative close-sourced\nLLMs over 100 billion parameters. Considering the data availability, we leveraged online social media datasets\nwith high-quality human-generated mental health labels. Due to the ethical concerns of existing AI research\nfor mental health, we aim to benchmark LLMs’ performance as an initial step before moving toward real-life\ndeployment. Our experiments contained three stages: (1) zero-shot prompting, where we experimented with\nvarious prompts related to mental health, (2) few-shot prompting, where we inserted examples into prompt\ninputs, and (3) instruction-finetuning, where we finetuned LLMs on multiple mental-health datasets with various\ntasks.\nOur results show that the zero-shot approach yields promising yet limited performance on various mental health\nprediction tasks across all models. Notably, FLAN-T5 and GPT-4 show encouraging performance, approaching\nthe state-of-the-art task-specific model. Meanwhile, providing a few shots in the prompt can improve the model\nperformance to some extent (Δ = 4.1%), but the advantage is limited. Finally and most importantly, we found that\ninstruction-finetuning significantly enhances the model performance across multiple mental-health-related tasks\nand various datasets simultaneously. Our finetuned Alpaca and FLAN-T5, namelyMental-Alpaca and Mental-\nFLAN-T5, significantly outperform the best of GPT-3.5 across zero-shot and few-shot settings (×25 and 15 bigger\nthan Alpaca and FLAN-T5) by an average of 10.9% on balance accuracy, as well as the best of GPT-4 by 4.8% (×250\nand 150 bigger than Alpaca and FLAN-T5). Meanwhile, Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5 can further perform\non par with the task-specific state-of-the-art Mental-RoBERTa [ 58]. We further conduct an exploratory case\nstudy on LLM’s capability of mental health reasoning (i.e., explaining the rationale behind their predictions). Our\nresults illustrate the promising future of certain LLMs like GPT-4, while also suggesting critical failure cases that\nneed future research attention. We open-source our code and model at https://github.com/neuhai/Mental-LLM.\nOur experiments present a comprehensive evaluation of various techniques to enhance LLMs’ capability in\nthe mental health domain. However, we also note that our technical resultsdo not imply deployability. There\nare many important limitations of leveraging LLMs in mental health settings, especially along known racial\nand gender gaps [ 6, 42]. We discuss the important ethical risks to be addressed before achieving real-world\ndeployment.\nThe contribution of our paper can be summarized as follows:\n(1) We present a comprehensive evaluation of prompt engineering, few-shot, and finetuning techniques on\nmultiple LLMs in the mental health domain.\n(2) With online social media data, our results reveal that finetuning on a variety of datasets can significantly\nimprove LLM’s capability on multiple mental-health-specific tasks across different datasets simultaneously.\n(3) We release our modelMental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5 as open-source LLMs targeted at multiple mental\nhealth prediction tasks.\n(4) We provide a few technical guidelines for future researchers and developers on turning LLMs into experts\nin specific domains. We also highlight the important ethical concerns regarding leveraging LLMs for\nhealth-related tasks.\n2 BACKGROUND\nWe briefly summarize the related work in leveraging online text data for mental health prediction (Sec. 2.1). We\nalso provide an overview of the ongoing research in LLMs and their application in the health domain (Sec. 2.2).\n2.1 Online Text Data and Mental Health\nOnline platforms, especially social media platforms, have been acknowledged as a promising lens that is capable\nof revealing insights into the psychological states, health, and well-being of both individuals and populations [22,\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\n32:4 • Xu et al.\n30, 33, 47, 91]. In the past decade, there has been extensive research about leveraging content analysis and social\ninteraction patterns to identify and predict risks associated with mental health issues, such as anxiety [8, 104, 111],\nmajor depressive disorder [32, 34, 89, 119, 128, 129], suicide ideation [19, 29, 35, 101, 114], and others [25, 27,\n77, 103]. The real-time nature of social media, along with its archival capabilities, often helps in mitigating\nretrospective bias. The rich amount of social media data also facilitates the identification, monitoring, and\npotential prediction of risk factors over time. In addition to observation and detection, social media platforms\ncould further serve as effective channels to offer in-time assistance to communities at risk [66, 73, 99].\nFrom the computational technology perspective, early research started with basic methods [27, 32, 77]. For\nexample, pioneering work by Coppersmith et al. [27] employed correlation analysis to reveal the relationship\nbetween social media language data and mental health conditions. Since then, researchers have proposed a wide\nrange of feature engineering methods and built machine-learning models for the prediction [14, 79, 82, 102, 119].\nFor example, De Choudhury et al. [34] extracted a number of linguistic styles and other features to build an\nSVM model to perform depression prediction. Researchers have also explored deep-learning-based models for\nmental health prediction to obviate the need for hand-crafted features [57, 107]. For instance, Tadesse et al. [114]\nemployed an LSTM-CNN model and took word embeddings as the input to detect suicide ideation on Reddit.\nMore recently, pre-trained language models have become a popular method for NLP tasks, including mental\nhealth prediction tasks [48, 58, 83]. For example, Jiang et al. [60] used the contextual representations from BERT\nas input features for mental health issue detection. Otsuka et al. [88] evaluated the performance of BERT-based\npre-trained models in clinical settings. Meanwhile, researchers have also explored the multi-task setup [12] that\naims to predict multiple labels. For example, Sarkar et al. [106] trained a multi-task model to predict depression\nand anxiety at the same time. However, these multi-task models are constrained to a predetermined task set\nand thus have limited flexibility. Our work joins the same goal and aims to achieve a more flexible multi-task\ncapability. We focus on the next-generation technology of instruction-finetuned LLMs, leverage their power in\nnatural language understanding, and explore their capability on mental health tasks with social media data.\n2.2 LLM and Health Applications\nAfter the great success of Transformer-based language models such as BERT [ 37] and GPT [96], researchers\nand practitioners have advanced towards larger and more powerful language models ( e.g., GPT-3 [17] and\nT5 [97]). Meanwhile, researchers have proposed instruction finetuning, a method that utilizes varied prompts\nacross multiple datasets and tasks. This technique guides a model during training and generation phases to\nperform diverse tasks within a single unified framework [123]. These instruction-finetuned LLMs, such as GPT-\n4 [18], PaLM [23], FLAN-T5 [24], LLaMA [117], Alpaca [115], contain tens to hundreds of billions of parameters,\ndemonstrating promising performance across a variety of tasks, such as question answering [ 87, 100], logic\nreasoning [124, 135], machine translation [15, 45], etc.\nResearchers have explored the capability of these LLMs in health fields [59, 70, 71, 75, 85, 112, 125? ]. For example,\nSinghal et al. [112] finetuned PaLM-2 on medical domains and achieved 86.5% on MedQA dataset. Similarly,\nWu et al. [125] finetuned LLaMA on medical papers and showed promising results on multiple biomedical QA\ndatasets. Jo et al. [61] explored the deployment of LLMs for public health scenarios. Jiang et al. [59] trained a\nmedical language model on unstructured clinical notes from the electronic health record and fine-tuned it across\na wide range of clinical and operational predictive tasks. Their evaluation indicates that such a model can be\nused for various clinical tasks.\nThere is relatively less work in the mental health domain. Some work explored the capability of LLMs for\nsentiment analysis and emotion reasoning [64, 95, 134].\nCloser to our study, Lamichhane [67] and Amin et al. [10] tested the performance of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) on\nmultiple classification tasks (e.g., stress, depression, and suicide detection). The results showed that ChatGPT\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob.

Yanget al. [132] further evaluated the potential reasoning\ncapability of GPT-3.5 for reasoning tasks (e.g., potential stressors). However, most previous studies focused solely\non zero-shot prompting and did not explore other methods to improve the performance of LLMs. Very recently,\nYang et al. [133] released Mental-LLaMA, a set of LLaMA-based models finetuned on mental health datasets\nfor a set of mental health tasks. Table 1 summarizes the recent related work exploring LLMs’ capabilities on\nmental-health-related tasks. None of the existing work explores the capability other than LLaMA or GPT-3.5. In\nthis work, we present a comprehensive and systematic exploration of multiple LLMs’ performance on mental\nhealth tasks, as well as multiple methods to improve their capabilities.\n3 METHODS\nWe introduce our experiment design with LMMs on multiple mental health prediction task setups, including\nzero-shot prompting (Sec. 3.1), few-shot prompting (Sec. 3.2), and instruction finetuning (Sec. 3.3). These setups\nare model-agnostic, and we will present the details of language models and datasets employed for our experiment\nin the next section.\n3.1 Zero-shot Prompting\nThe language understanding and reasoning capability of LLMs have enabled a wide range of applications without\nthe need for any domain-specific data, but only providing appropriate prompts [ 65, 122]. Therefore, we start\nwith prompt design for mental health tasks in a zero-shot setting.\nThe goal of prompt design is to empower a pre-trained general-purpose LLM to achieve good performance on\ntasks in the mental health domain. We propose a general zero-shot prompt template (Prompt𝑍𝑆) that consists of\nfour parts:\nPrompt𝑍𝑆 = TextData +PromptPart1-S +PromptPart2-Q +OutputConstraint (1)\nwhere TextData is the online text data generated by end-users. PromptPart1-S provides specifications for a mental\nhealth prediction target. PromptPart2-Q poses the question for LLMs to answer. And OutputConstraint controls the\noutput of models (e.g., “Only return yes or no” for a binary classification task).\nWe propose several design strategies for PromptPart1-S, as shown in the top part of Table 2: (1) Basic, which\nleaves it as blank; (2) Context Enhancement, which provides more social media context about the TextData; (3)\nMental Health Enhancement , which inserts mental health concept by asking the model to act as an expert. (4)\nContext & Mental Health Enhancement , which combines both enhancement strategies by asking the model\nto act as a mental health expert under the social media context.\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\n32:6 • Xu et al.\nTable 2. Prompt Design for Mental Health Prediction Tasks. PromptPart1-S aims to provide a better specification for LLMs\nand PromptPart2-Q poses the questions for LLMs to answer. For Part 1, we propose three strategies: context enhancement,\nmental health enhancement, and the combination of both. As for Part 2, we design different content for multiple mental\nhealth problem categories and prediction tasks. For each part, we propose two to three versions to improve its variation.\nStrategy PromptPart1-S\nBasic •{ blank }\nContext Enhancement •This person wrote this paragraph on social media.\n•Consider this post on social media to answer the question.\nMental Health Enhancement•As a psychologist, read the post on social media and answer the question.\n•If you are a psychologist, read the post on social media and answer the question.\nContext & Mental Health Enhancement\n•This person wrote this paragraph on social media. As a psychologist, read the post on social media\nand answer the question.\n•This person wrote this paragraph on social media. As a psychologist, consider the mental well-being\ncondition expressed in this post, read the post on social media, and answer the question.\nCategory Task PromptPart2-Q\nMental state\n(e.g., stressed,\ndepressed)\nBinary classification\n(e.g., yes or no)\n•Is the poster [stressed]?\n•Is the poster of this post [stressed]?\n•Determine if the poster of this post is [stressed].\nMulti-class classification\n(e.g., multiple levels)\n•Which level is the person [stressed]?\n•How [stressed] is the person?\n•Determine how [stressed] the person is.\nCritical risk action\n(e.g., suicide)\nBinary classification\n(e.g., yes or no)\n•Does the poster want to [suicide]?\n•Is the poster likely to [suicide]?\n•Determine if the poster of this post want to [suicide].\nMulti-class classification\n(e.g., multiple levels)\n•Which level of [suicide] risk does the person have?\n•How [suicidal] is the person?\n•Determine which level of [suicide] risk does the person have.\nAs for PromptPart2-Q, we mainly focus on two categories of mental health prediction targets: (1) predicting\ncritical mental states, such as stress or depression, and (2) predicting high-stake risk actions, such as suicide. We\ntailor the question description for each category. Moreover, for both categories, we explore binary and multi-class\nclassification tasks 1. Thus, we also make small modifications based on specific tasks to ensure appropriate\nquestions (see Sec. 4 for our mental health tasks). The bottom part of Table 2 summarizes the mapping.\nFor both PromptPart1-S and PromptPart2-Q, we propose several versions to improve its variability. We then evaluate\nthese prompts on multiple LLMs on different datasets and compare their performance.\n3.2 Few-shot Prompting\nIn order to provide more domain-specific information, researchers have also explored few-shot prompting with\nLLMs by providing few-shot demonstrations to support in-context learning (e.g., [7, 31]). Note that these few\nexamples are used solely in prompts, and the model parameters remain unchanged. The intuition is to present a\nfew “examples” for the model to learn domain-specific knowledge in situ . In our setting, we also test this strategy\nby adding additional randomly sampled [Prompt𝑍𝑆 −label] pairs. The design of the few-shot prompt (Prompt𝐹𝑆)\n1We also conduct an exploratory case study on mental health reasoning tasks. Please see more details in Sec. 5.4.\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\nMental-LLM • 32:7\nis straightforward:\nPrompt𝐹𝑆 = [Sample Prompt𝑍𝑆 −label]𝑀 +Prompt𝑍𝑆 (2)\nwhere 𝑀 is the number of prompt-label pairs and is capped by the input length limit of a model. Note that both\nthe Sample Prompt𝑍𝑆 and Prompt𝑍𝑆 follow Eq. 1 and employ the same design of PromptPart1-S and PromptPart2-Q\nto ensure consistency.\n3.3 Instruction Finetuning\nIn contrast to the few-shot prompting strategy in Sec. 3.2, the goal of this strategy is closer to the traditional\nfew-shot transfer learning, where we further train the model with a small amount of domain-specific data (e.g.,\n[52, 71, 126]). We experiment with multiple finetuning strategies.\n3.3.1 Single-dataset Finetuning. Following most of the previous work in the mental health field [26, 35, 132], we\nfirst conduct basic finetuning on a single dataset (the training set). This finetuned model can be tested on the\nsame dataset (the test set) to evaluate its performance and different datasets to evaluate its generalizability.\n3.3.2 Multi-dataset Finetuning. From Sec. 3.1 to Sec. 3.3.1, we have been focusing on one single mental health\ndataset 𝐷. More interestingly, we further experiment with finetuning across multiple datasets simultaneously.\nSpecifically, we leverage instruction finetuning to enable LLMs to handle multiple tasks in different datasets [17].\nIt is noteworthy that such an instruction finetuning setup differs from the state-of-the-art mental-health-specific\nmodels (e.g., Mental-RoBERTa [58]). The previous models are finetuned for a specific task, such as depression\nprediction or suicidal ideation prediction. Once trained on task A, the model becomes specific to task A and is\nonly suitable for solving that particular task. In contrast, we finetune LLMs on several mental health datasets,\nemploying diverse instructions for different tasks across these datasets in a single iteration. This enables them to\nhandle multiple tasks without additional task-specific finetuning.\nFor both single- and multi-dataset finetuning, we follow the same two steps:\nStep 1: Finetune with [Prompt𝑍𝑆 −label]𝐼Í𝑁𝐷𝑖−𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛\nStep 2: Test with [Prompt𝑍𝑆]𝐼Í𝑁𝐷𝑖−𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡\n(3)\nwhere 𝑁𝐷𝑖−𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 /𝑁𝐷𝑖−𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is the total size of the training/test dataset 𝐷𝑖, 𝐼 represents the set of datasets used for\nfinetuning, and 𝑖 indicates the specific dataset index (𝑖 ∈𝐼,|𝐼|≥ 1). Both Prompt𝑍𝑆-train and Prompt𝑍𝑆-test follow\nEq. 1. Similar to the few-shot setup in Eq. 2, they employ the same design of PromptPart1-S and PromptPart2-Q.\n4 IMPLEMENTATION\nOur method design is agnostic to specific datasets or models. In this section, we introduce the specific datasets\n(Sec. 4.1) and models (Sec. 4.2) involved in our experiments. In particular, we highlight our instructional-finetuned\nopen-source models Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5 (Sec. 4.2.1). We also provide an overview of our\nexperiment setup and evaluation metrics (Sec. 4.3).\n4.1 Datasets and Tasks\nOur experiment is based on four well-established datasets that are commonly employed for mental health analysis.\nThese datasets were collected from Reddit due to their high-quality and availability. It is noteworthy that we\nintentionally avoid using datasets with weak labels based on specific linguistic patterns ( e.g., whether a user\never stated “I was diagnosed with X”). Instead, we used ones with human expert annotations or supervision. We\ndefine six diverse mental health prediction tasks based on these datasets.\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\n32:8 • Xu et al.\n•Dreaddit [120]: This dataset collected posts via Reddit PRAW API [94] from Jan 1, 2017 to Nov 19, 2018,\nwhich contains ten subreddits in the five domains (abuse, social, anxiety, PTSD, and financial) and includes\n2929 users’ posts. Multiple human annotators rated whether sentence segments showed the stress of the\nposter, and the annotations were aggregated to generate final labels. We used this dataset for a post-level\nbinary stress prediction (Task 1).\n•DepSeverity [80]: This dataset leveraged the same posts collected in [120], but with a different focus on\ndepression. Two human annotators followed DSM-5 [98] and categorized posts into four levels of depression:\nminimal, mild, moderate, and severe. We employed this dataset for two post-level tasks: binary depression\nprediction (i.e., whether a post showed at least mild depression,Task 2), and four-level depression prediction\n(Task 3).\n•SDCNL [49]: This dataset also collected posts from Python Reddit API, including r/SuicideWatch and\nr/Depressionfrom 1723 users. Through manual annotation, they labeled whether each post showed suicidal\nthoughts. We employed this dataset for the post-level binary suicide ideation prediction (Task 4).\n•CSSRS-Suicide [40]: This dataset contains posts from 15 mental health-related subreddits from 2181\nusers between 2005 and 2016. Four practicing psychiatrists followed Columbia Suicide Severity Rating\nScale (C-SSRS) guidelines [93] to manually annotate 500 users on suicide risks in five levels: supportive,\nindicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt. We leveraged this dataset for two user-level tasks: binary suicide\nrisk prediction (i.e., whether a user showed at least suicide indicator, Task 5), and five-level suicide risk\nprediction (Task 6).\nIn order to test the generalizability of our methods, we also leveraged three other datasets from various\nplatforms. Similarly, all datasets contain human annotations as labels.\n•Red-Sam [62, 105]: This dataset also collected posts with PRAW API [ 94] , involving five subreddits\n(Mental Health, depression, loneliness, stress, anxiety). Two domain experts’ annotations were aggregated\nto generate depression labels. We used this dataset as an external evaluation dataset on binary depression\ndetection (Task 2 ). Although also from Reddit, this dataset was not involved in few-shot learning or\ninstruction finetuning. We cross-checked datasets to ensure there were no overlapping posts.\n•Twt-60Users [56]: This dataset collected twitters from 60 users during 2015 with Twitter API. Two human\nannotators labeled every tweet with depression labels. We used this non-Reddit dataset as an external\nevaluation dataset on depression detection (Task 2). Note that this dataset has imbalanced labels (90.7%\nFalse), as most tweets did not indicate mental distress.\n•SAD [76]: This dataset contains SMS-like text messages with nine types of daily stressor categories (work,\nschool, financial problem, emotional turmoil, social relationships, family issues, health, everyday decision-\nmaking, and other). These messages were written by 3578 humans. We used this non-Reddit dataset as an\nexternal evaluation dataset on binary stress detection (Task 1). Note that human crowd-workers write the\nmessages under certain stressor-triggered instructions. Therefore, this dataset has imbalanced labels on the\nother side (94.0% True).\nTable 3 summarizes the information of the seven datasets and six mental health prediction tasks. For each\ndataset, we conducted an 80%/20% train-test split. Notably, to avoid data leakage, each user’s data were placed\nexclusively in either the training or test set.\n4.2 Models\nWe experimented with multiple LLMs with different sizes, pre-training targets, and availability.\nProc.

Experiments have shown that Alpaca behaves qualitatively\nsimilarly to OpenAI’s text-davinci-003 on certain task metrics. We choose the relatively small 7B\nversion to facilitate running and finetuning on consumer hardware.\n•Alpaca-LoRA (7B) [51]: Another open-source large model finetuned from LLaMA 7B model using the same\ndataset as Alpaca [115]. This model leverages a different finetuning technique called low-rank adaptation\n(LoRA) [51], with the goal of reducing finetuning cost by freezing the model weights and injecting trainable\nrank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture. Despite the similarity in\nnames, it is important to note that Alpaca-LoRA is entirely distinct from Alpaca. They are trained on the\nsame dataset but with different methods.\n•FLAN-T5 (11B) [24]: An open-source large model T5 [97] finetuned with a variety of task-based datasets\non instructions. Compared to other LLMs, FLAN-T5 focuses more on task solving and is less optimized for\nnatural language or dialogue generation. We picked the largest version of FLAN-T5 (i.e., FLAN-T5-XXL),\nwhich has a comparable size of Alpaca.\n•LLaMA2 (70B) [118]: A recent open-source large model released by Meta. We picked the largest version of\nLLaMA2, whose size is between FLAN-T5 and GPT-3.5.\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\n32:10 • Xu et al.\n•GPT-3.5 (175B) [1]: This large model is closed-source and available through API provided by OpenAI. We\npicked the gpt-3.5-turbo, one of the most capable and cost-effective models in the GPT-3.5 family.\n•GPT-4 (1700B) [18]: This is the largest closed-source model available through OpenAI API. We picked the\ngpt-4-0613. Due to the limited availability of API, the cost of finetuning GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 is prohibitive.\nIt is worth noting that Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, GPT-3.5, LLaMA2 and GPT-4 are all finetuned with natural\ndialogue as one of the optimization goals. In contrast, FLAN-T5 is more focused on task-solving. In our case, the\nuser-written input posts resemble natural dialogue, whereas the mental health prediction tasks are defined as\nspecific classification tasks. It is unclear and thus interesting to explore which LLM fits better with our goal.\n4.2.1 Mental-Alpaca & Mental-FLAN-T5. Our methods of zero-shot prompting (Sec. 3.1) and few-shot prompting\n(Sec. 3.2) do not update model parameters during the experiment. In contrast, instruction finetuning (Sec. 3.3) will\nupdate model parameters and generate new models. To enhance their capability in the mental health domains, we\nupdate Alpaca and FLAN-T5 on six tasks across the four datasets in Sec. 4.1 using the multi-dataset instruction\nfinetuning method (Sec. 3.3.2), which leads to our new model Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5.\n4.3 Experiment Setup and Metrics\nFor zero-shot and few-shot prompting methods, we load open-source models (Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, FLAN-\nT5, LLaMA2) with one to eight Nvidia A100 GPUs to do the tasks, depending on the size of the model. For\nclosed-source models (GPT-3.5, and GPT-4), we use OpenAI API to conduct chat completion tasks.\nAs for finetuning Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5, we merge the four datasets together and provide\ninstructions for all six tasks (in the training set). We use eight Nvidia A100 GPUs for instruction finetuning. With\ncross entropy as the loss function, we backpropagate and update model parameters in 3 epochs, with Adam\noptimizer and a learning rate as 2𝑒−5 (cosine scheduler, warmup ratio 0.03).\nWe focus on balanced accuracy as the main evaluation metric, i.e., the mean of sensitivity (true positive rate)\nand specificity (true negative rate). We picked this metric since it is more robust to class imbalance compared to\nthe accuracy or F1 score [16, 129]. It is noteworthy that the sizes of LLMs we compare are vastly different, with\nthe number of parameters ranging from 7B to 1700B. A larger model is usually expected to have a better overall\nperformance than a smaller model. We inspect whether this expectation holds in our experiments.\n5 RESULTS\nWe summarize our experiment results with zero-shot prompting (Sec. 5.1), few-shot prompting (Sec. 5.2), and\ninstruction finetuning (Sec. 5.3). Moreover, although we mainly focus on prediction tasks in this research, we\nalso present the initial results of our exploratory case study on mental health reasoning tasks in Sec. 5.4.\nOverall, our results show that zero-shot and few-shot settings show promising performance of LLMs for\nmental health tasks, although their performance is still limited. Instruction-finetuning on multiple datasets\n(Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5) can significantly boost models’ performance on all tasks simultaneously.\nOur case study also reveals the strong reasoning capability of certain LLMs, especially GPT-4. However, we note\nthat these results do not indicate the deployability. We highlight important ethical concerns and gaps in Sec. 6.\n5.1 Zero-shot Prompting Shows Promising yet Limited Performance\nWe start with the most basic zero-shot prompting with Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, FLAN-T5, LLaMA2, GPT-3.5, and\nGPT-4. The balanced accuracy results are summarized in the first sections of Table 4. Alpaca𝑍𝑆 and Alpaca-LoRA𝑍𝑆\nachieve better overall performance than the naive majority baseline ( ΔAlpaca = 5.5%, ΔAlpaca-LoRA = 5.6%), but\nthey are far from the task-specific baseline models BERT and Mental-RoBERTa (which have 20%-25% advantages).\nProc.

GPT-3.5’s advantage over Alpaca and Alpaca-LoRA is expected due to\nits larger size (25×).\nSurprisingly, FLAN-T5𝑍𝑆 achieves much better overall results compared to Alpaca𝑍𝑆 (ΔFLAN-T5_𝑣𝑠_Alpaca = 10.9%)\nand Alpaca-LoRA𝑍𝑆 (ΔFLAN-T5_𝑣𝑠_Alpaca-LoRA = 11.0%), and even LLaMA2 (ΔFLAN-T5_𝑣𝑠_LLaMA2 = 1.0%) and GPT-3.5\n(ΔFLAN-T5_𝑣𝑠_GPT-3.5 = 4.2%). Note that LLaMA2 is 6 times bigger than FLAN-T5 and GPT-3.5 is 15 times bigger. On\nTask #6 (Five-level Suicide Risk Prediction), FLAN-T5𝑍𝑆 even outperforms the state-of-the-art Mental-RoBERTa\nby 4.5%. Comparing these results, the task-solving-focused model FLAN-T5 appears to be better at the mental\nhealth prediction tasks in a zero-shot setting. We will introduce more interesting findings after finetuning (see\nSec. 5.3.1).\nIn contrast, the advantage of GPT-4 becomes relatively less remarkable considering its gigantic size.GPT-4𝑍𝑆’s\naverage performance outperforms FLAN-T5𝑍𝑆 (150×size), LLaMA2𝑍𝑆 (25×size), and GPT-3.5𝑍𝑆 (10×size) by\n6.4%, 7.5%, and 10.6%, respectively. Yet it is still very encouraging to observe that GPT-4 is approaching the\nstate-of-the-art on these tasks (ΔGPT-4_𝑣𝑠_Mental-RoBERTa = −7.9%), and it also outperforms Mental-RoBERTa on\nTask #6 by 4.5%. In general, these results indicate the promising capability of LLMs on mental health prediction\ntasks compared to task-specific models, even without any domain-specific information.\n5.1.1 The Effectiveness of Enhancement Strategies. In Sec. 3.1, we propose context enhancement, mental health\nenhancement, and their combination strategies for zero-shot prompt design to provide more information about\nthe domain. Interestingly, our results suggest varied effectiveness on different LLMs and datasets.\nTable 5 provides a zoom-in summary of the zero-shot part in Table 4. For Alpaca, LLaMA2, GPT-3.5, and\nGPT-4, the three strategies improved the performance in general (ΔAlpaca = 1.0%, 13 out of 18 tasks show positive\nchanges; ΔLLaMA2 = 0.3%, 12/18 tasks positive; ΔGPT-3.5 = 2.8%, 12/18 tasks positive; ΔGPT-4 = 0.2%, 11/18 tasks\npositive). However, for Alpaca-LoRA and FLAN-T5, adding more context or mental health domain information\nwould reduce the model performance (ΔAlpaca-LoRA = −2.7%, ΔFLAN-T5 = −1.6%). For Alpaca-LoRA, this limitation\nmay stem from being trained with fewer parameters, potentially constraining its ability to understand context\nor domain specifics. For FLAN-T5, this reduced performance might be attributed to its limited capability in\nprocessing additional information, as it is primarily tuned for task-solving.\nThe effectiveness of strategies on different datasets/tasks also varies. We observe that Task#4 from the SDCNL\ndataset and Task#6 from the CSSRS-Suicide dataset benefit the most from the enhancement. In particular, GPT-\n3.5 benefits very significantly from enhancement on Task #4 ( ΔGPT-3.5−Task#4 = 14.8%). And LLaMA2 benefits\nsignificantly on Task #6 (ΔGPT-3.5−Task#6 = 6.8%). These could be caused by the different nature of datasets. Our\nresults suggest that these enhancement strategies are generally more effective for critical action prediction (e.g.,\nsuicide, 2/3 tasks positive) than mental state prediction (e.g., stress and depression, 1/3 task positive).\nWe also compare the effectiveness of different strategies on the four models with positive effects: Alpaca,\nLLaMA2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. The context enhancement strategy has the most stable improvement across all\nmental health prediction tasks ( ΔAlpaca−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 2.1%, 6/6 tasks positive; ΔLLaMA2−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 1.2%, 4/6 tasks\npositive; ΔGPT-3.5−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 2.5%, 5/6 tasks positive; ΔGPT-4−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 = 0.4%, 5/6 tasks positive). Comparatively, the\nmental health enhancement strategy is less effective (ΔAlpaca−𝑚ℎ = 1.1%, 5/6 tasks positive; ΔLLaMA2−𝑚ℎ = −0.5%,\n4/6 tasks positive; ΔGPT-3.5−𝑚ℎ = 2.1%, 3/6 tasks positive; ΔGPT-4−𝑚ℎ = 0.2%, 3/6 tasks positive). The combination\nof the two strategies yields diverse results. It has the most significant improvement on GPT-3.5’s performance,\nbut not on all tasks (ΔGPT-3.5−𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ = 3.9%, 4/6 tasks positive), followed by LLaMA2 (ΔLLaMA2−𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ = 0.2%, 4/6 tasks\npositive). However, it has slightly negative impact on the average performance of Alpaca (ΔAlpaca−𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ = −0.1%,\n2/6 tasks positive) or GPT-4 (ΔGPT-4−𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ = −0.3%, 3/6 tasks positive). This indicates that larger language models\n(LLaMA2, GPT-3.5 vs. Alpaca) have a strong capability to leverage the information embedded in the prompts.\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob.

Note that since we observe diverse effects of prompt\ndesign strategies in Table 5, in this section, we only experiment with the prompts with the best performance in\nthe zero-shot setting. Moreover, we exclude Alpaca-LoRA due to its less promising results and LLaMA2 due to its\nhigh computation cost.\nDue to the maximum input token length of models (2048), we focus on Dreaddit and DepSeverity datasets that\nhave a shorter input and experiment with 𝑀 = 2 in Eq. 2 for binary classification and 𝑀 = 4/5 for multi-class\nProc.

We repeat the experiment on each task three times and randomize the\nfew shot samples for each run.\nWe summarize the overall results in the second section of Table 4 and the zoom-in comparison results in Table 6.\nAlthough language models with few-shot prompting still underperform task-specific models, providing examples\nof the task can improve model performance on most tasks compared to zero-shot prompting (Δ𝐹𝑆_𝑣𝑠_𝑍𝑆 = 4.1%).\nInterestingly, few-shot prompting is more effective for Alpaca 𝐹𝑆 and FLAN-T5𝐹𝑆 (ΔAlpaca = 8.1%, 3/3 tasks\npositive; ΔFLAN-T5 = 5.9%, 3/3 tasks positive) than GPT-3.5𝐹𝑆 and GPT-4𝐹𝑆 (ΔGPT-3.5 = 1.2%, 2/3 tasks positive;\nΔGPT-4 = 0.9%, 2/3 tasks positive). Especially for Task #3, we observe an improved balanced accuracy of 19.7% for\nAlpaca but a decline of 2.3% for GPT-3.5, so that Alpaca outperforms GPT-3.5 on this task. A similar situation is\nobserved for FLAN-T5 (improved by 12.7%) and GPT-4 (declined by 0.2%) on Task #1. This may be attributed to\nthe fact that smaller models such as Alpaca and FLAN-T5 can quickly adapt to complex tasks with only a few\nexamples. In contrast, larger models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with their extensive “in memory” data, find it more\nchallenging to rapidly learn from new examples.\nThis leads to the key message from this experiment: Few-shot prompting can improve the performance\nof LLMs on mental health prediction tasks to some extent, especially for small models.\n5.3 Instruction Finetuning Boost Performance for Multiple Tasks Simultaneously\nOur experiments so far have shown that zero-shot and few-shot prompting can improve LLMs on mental health\ntasks to some extent, but their overall performance is still below state-of-the-art task-specific models. In this\nsection, we explore the effectiveness of instruction finetuning.\nDue to the prohibitive cost and lack of transparency of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 finetuning, we only experiment\nwith Alpaca and FLAN-T5 that we have full control of. We picked the most informative prompt to provide more\nembedded knowledge during the finetuning. As introduced in Sec. 3.3.2 and Sec. 4.2.1, we build Mental-Alpaca\nand Mental-FLAN-T5 by finetuning Alpaca and FLAN-T5 on all six tasks across four datasets at the same time.\nThe third section of Table 4 summarizes the overall results, and Table 7 highlights the key comparisons.\nWe observe that both Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5 achieve significantly better performance com-\npared to the unfinetuned versions (ΔAlpaca−𝐹𝑇_𝑣𝑠_𝑍𝑆 = 23.4%, ΔAlpaca−𝐹𝑇_𝑣𝑠_𝐹𝑆 = 18.3%; ΔFLAN-T5−𝐹𝑇_𝑣𝑠_𝑍𝑆 = 14.7%,\nΔFLAN-T5−𝐹𝑇_𝑣𝑠_𝐹𝑆 = 14.0%). Both finetuned models surpass GPT-3.5’s best performance among zero-shot and\nfew-shot settings across all six tasks (ΔMental-Alpaca_𝑣𝑠_GPT-3.5 = 10.1%; ΔMental-FLAN-T5_𝑣𝑠_GPT-3.5 = 11.6%) and outper-\nform GPT-4’s best version in most tasks (ΔMental-Alpaca_𝑣𝑠_GPT-4 = 4.0%, 4/6 tasks positive; ΔMental-FLAN-T5_𝑣𝑠_GPT-4 =\nTable 6.

Recall that GPT-3.5/GPT-4 are 25/250 times bigger than Mental-Alpaca and 15/150 times\nbigger than Mental-FLAN-T5.\nMore importantly, Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5 perform on par with the state-of-the-art Mental-\nRoBERTa. Mental-Alpaca has the best performance on one task and the second best on three tasks, while\nMental-FLAN-T5 has the best performance on three tasks. It is noteworthy that Mental-RoBERTa is a task-specific\nmodel, which means it is specialized on one task after being trained on it. In contrast, Mental-Alpaca and Mental-\nFLAN-T5 can simultaneously work across all tasks with a single-round finetuning. These results show the strong\neffectiveness of instruction finetuning: By finetuning LLMs on multiple mental health datasets with instructions,\nthe models can obtain better capability to solve a variety of mental health prediction tasks.\n5.3.1 Dialogue-Focused vs. Task-Solving-Focused LLMs. We further compare Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5.\nOverall, their performance is quite close ( ΔFLAN-T5_𝑣𝑠_Alpaca = 1.4%), with Mental-Alapca better at Task #4 on\nSDCNL and Mental-FLAN-T5 better at Task #5 and #6 on CSSRS-Suicide. In Sec. 5.1, we observe that FLAN-T5𝑍𝑆\nhas a much better performance than Alpaca 𝑍𝑆 (ΔFLAN-T5_𝑣𝑠_Alpaca = 10.9%, 5/6 tasks positive) in the zero-shot\nsetting. However, after finetuning, FLAN-T5’s advantage disappears.\nOur comparison result indicates that Alpaca, as a dialogue-focused model, is better at learning from human\nnatural language data compared to FLAN-T5. Although FLAN-T5 is good at task solving and thus has a better\nperformance in the zero-shot setting, its performance improvement after instruction finetuning is relatively\nsmaller than that of Alpaca. This observation has implications for future stakeholders. If the data and computing\nresources for finetuning are not available, using task-solving-focused LLMs could lead to better results. When\nthere are enough data and computing resources, finetuning dialogue-based models can be a better choice. Further-\nmore, models like Alpaca, with their dialogue conversation capabilities, may be more suitable for downstream\napplications, such as mental well-being assistants for end-users.\n5.3.2 Does Finetuning Generalize across Datasets? We further measure the generalizability of LLMs after finetun-\ning. To do this, we instruction-finetune the model on one dataset and evaluate it on all datasets (as introduced\nTable 7.

As the main purpose of this part is not to compare different models but evaluate the finetuning\nmethod, we only focus on Alpaca. Table 8 summarizes the results.\nWe first find that finetuning and testing on the same dataset lead to good performance, as indicated by the\nboxed entries on the diagonal in Table 8. Some results are even better than Mental-Alpaca (5 out of 6 tasks)\nor Mental-RoBERTa (3 out of 6 tasks), which is not surprising. More interestingly, we investigate cross-dataset\ngeneralization performance (i.e., the ones off the diagonal). Overall, finetuning on a single dataset achieves better\nperformance compared to the zero-shot setting (Δ𝐹𝑇-Single_𝑣𝑠_𝑍𝑆 = 4.2%). However, the performance changes vary\nacross tasks. For example, finetuning on any dataset is beneficial for Task #3 (Δ = 19.2%) and #5 (Δ = 16.4%), but\ndetrimental for Task #6 (Δ = −7.6%) and almost futile for Task #4 (Δ = −0.4%). Generalizing across Dreaddit and\nDepSeverity shows good performance, but this is mainly because they share the language corpus. These results\nindicate that finetuning on a single dataset can provide mental health knowledge with a certain level and thus\nimprove the overall generalization results, but such improvement is not stable across tasks.\nMoreover, we further evaluate the generalizability of our best models instructional-finetuned on multiple\ndatasets, i.e., Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5. We leverage external datasets that are not included in the\nfinetuning. Table 9 highlights the key results. More detailed results can be found in Table 10.\nConsistent with the results in Table 7, the instruction finetuning enhances the model performance on external\ndatasets (Δ𝐴𝑙𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑎 = 16.3%, Δ𝐹𝐿𝐴𝑁−𝑇5 = 5.1%). Both Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5 ranked top 1 or 2 in 2/3\nexternal tasks. It is noteworthy that Twt-60Users and SAD datasets are collected outside Reddit, and their data\nis different from the source of finetuning datasets. These results demonstrate strong evidence that instruction\nfinetuning with diverse tasks, even with data collected from a single social media platform, can significantly\nenhance LLMs’ generalizability across multiple scenarios.\n5.3.3 How Much Data Is Needed? Additionally, we are interested in exploring how the size of the dataset impacts\nthe results of instruction finetuning. To answer this question, we downsample the training set to 50%, 20%, 10%,\n5%, and 1% of the original size and repeat each one three times. We increase the training epoch accordingly to\nmake sure that the model is exposed to a similar amount of data. Similarly, we also focus on Alpaca only. Figure 1\nvisualizes the results. With only 1% of the data, the finetuned model is able to outperform the zero-shot model\non most tasks (5 out of 6). With 5% of the data, the finetuned model has a better performance on all tasks. As\nexpected, the model performance has an increasing trend with more training data. For many tasks, the trend\nTable 8.

The difference between 10% training data (less than 300 samples per dataset) and\n100% training data is not huge (Δ = 5.9%).\n5.3.4 More Data in One Dataset vs. Fewer Data across Multiple Datasets. In Sec. 5.3.2, the finetuning on a single\ndataset can be viewed as training on a smaller set (around 5-25% of the original size) with less variation (i.e., no\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\n32:18 • Xu et al.\nfinetuning across datasets). Thus, the results in Sec. 5.3.2 are comparable to those in Sec. 5.3.3. We found that\nthe model’s overall performance is better when the model is finetuned across multiple datasets when overall\ntraining data sizes are similar (Δ𝐹𝑇-5%_𝑣𝑠_𝐹𝑇-Single = 3.8%, Δ𝐹𝑇-10%_𝑣𝑠_𝐹𝑇-Single = 8.1%, Δ𝐹𝑇-20%_𝑣𝑠_𝐹𝑇-Single = 12.4%).\nThis suggests that increasing data variation can more effectively benefit finetuning outcomes when the training\ndata size is fixed.\nThese results can guide future developers and practitioners in collecting the appropriate data size and sources\nto finetune LLMs for the mental health domain efficiently. We have more discussion in the next section. In\nsummary, we highlight the key takeaways of our finetuning experiments as follows:\n•Instruction finetuning on multiple mental health datasets can significantly boost the perfor-\nmance of LLMs on various mental health prediction tasks. Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5\noutperform GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and perform on par with the state-of-the-art task-specific model.\n•Although task-solving-focused LLMs may have better performance in the zero-shot setting for\nmental health prediction tasks, dialogue-focused LLMs have a stronger capability of learning\nfrom human natural language and can improve more significantly after finetuning.\n•Finetuning LLMs on a small number of datasets and tasks may improve model generalizable\nknowledge in mental health, but its effect is not robust. Comparatively, finetuning on diverse\ntasks can robustly enhance generalizability across multiple social media platforms.\n•Finetuning LLMs on a small number of samples (a few hundred) across multiple datasets can\nalready achieve favorable performance.\n•When the data size is the same, finetuning LLMs on data with larger variation ( i.e., more datasets\nand tasks) can achieve better performance.\n5.4 Case Study of LLMs’ Capability on Mental Health Reasoning\nIn addition to evaluating LLMs’ performance on classification tasks, we also take an initial step to explore\nLLMs’ capability on mental health reasoning. This is another strong advantage of LLMs since they can generate\nhuman-like natural language based on embedded knowledge. Due to the high cost of a systematic evaluation of\nreasoning outcomes, here we present a few examples as a case study across different LLMs. It is noteworthy that\nwe do not aim to claim that certain LLMs have better/worse reasoning capabilities. Instead, this section aims to\nprovide a general sense of LLMs’ performance on mental health reasoning tasks.\nSpecifically, we modify the prompt design by inserting a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt [ 65] at the end\nof OutputConstraint in Eq. 1: “Return [set of classification labels]. Provide reasons step by step”. We compare\nAlpaca, FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our results indicate the promising reasoning capability of these models,\nespecially GPT-3.5 and GPRT-4. We also experimented with the finetuned Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5.\nUnfortunately, our results show that after finetuning solely on classification tasks, these two models are no\nlonger able to generate reasoning sentences even with the CoT prompt. This suggests a limitation of the current\nfinetuned model.\n5.4.1 Diverse Reasoning Capabilities across LLMs. We present several examples as our case study to illustrate the\nreasoning capability of these LLMs. The first example comes from the binary stress prediction task (Task #1)\non the Dreaddit dataset (see Figure 2). All models give the right classification, but with significantly different\nreasoning capabilities. First, FLAN-T5 generates the shortest reason. Although it is reasonable, it is superficial\nand does not provide enough insights. This is understandable because FLAN-T5 is targeted at task-solving instead\nof reasoning. Compared to FLAN-T5, Alpaca generates better reason. Among the five reasons, two of them\naccurately analyze the user’s mental state given the stressful situations. Meanwhile, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 generate\nexpert-level high-quality reasons. The inference from the user’s statement is accurate and deep, indicating their\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\nMental-LLM • 32:19\npowerful capability of understanding human emotion and mental health. Comparing the two models, GPT-3.5’s\nreason is simpler, following the user’s statement point by point and adding basic comments, while GPT-4’s output\nis more organic and insightful, yet more concise.\nFig. 2. A Case Study of Correct Reasoning Examples on Task #1 Binary Stress Prediction on Dreaddit Dataset. Bolded texts\nhighlight the mental-health-related content in the input section, and the answers of LLMs. Underlined texts highlight the\nreasoning content generated by LLMs, and italicized & underlined texts indicate the wrong or unrelated content.\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\n32:20 • Xu et al.\nFig. 3. A Case Study of Mixed Reasoning Examples on Task #3 Four-level Depression Prediction on DepSeverity Dataset.\nAlpaca wrongly predicted the label, and GPT-3.5 provided a wrong inference on the meaning of “relief”.\nWe also have a similar observation in the second example from the four-level depression prediction task\n(Task #3) on the DepSeverity dataset (see Figure 3). In this example, although FLAN-T5’s prediction is correct, it\nsimply repeats the fact stated by the user, without providing further insights. Alpaca makes the wrong prediction,\nbut it provides one sentence of accurate reasoning (although relatively shallow). GPT-3.5 makes an ambiguous\nprediction that includes the correct answer. In contrast, GPT-4 generates the highest quality reasoning with the\nright prediction. With its correct understanding of depressive symptoms, GPT-4 can accurately infer from the\nuser’s situation, link it to symptoms, and provides insightful analysis.\n5.4.2 Wrong and Dangerous Reasoning from LLMs. However, we also want to emphasize the incorrect reasoning\ncontent, which may lead to negative consequences and risks. In the first example, Alpaca generated two wrong\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\nMental-LLM • 32:21\nFig. 4. A Case Study of Incorrect Reasoning Examples on Task #1 Binary Stress Prediction on Dreaddit Dataset. FLAN-T5,\nGPT-3.5, and GPT-4 all make false positive predictions. All four LLMs provide problematic reasons.\nreasons for the hallucinated “reliance on others” and “safety concerns”, along with an unrelated reason for\nreaders instead of the poster. In the second example, GPT-3.5 misunderstood what the user meant by “relief”. To\nbetter illustrate this, we further present another example where all four LLMs make problematic reasoning (see\nFigure 4). In this example, the user was asking for others’ opinions on social anxiety, with their own job interview\nexperience as an example. Although the user mentioned situations where they were anxious and stressed, it’s\nclear that they were calm when writing this post and described their experience in an objective way. However,\nFLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 all mistakenly take the description of the anxious interview experience as evidence\nto support their wrong prediction. Although Alpaca makes the right prediction, it does not understand the main\ntheme of the post. The false positives reveal that LLMs may overly generalize in a wrong way: Being stressed in\none situation does not indicate that a person is stressed all the time. However, the reasoning content alone reads\nsmoothly and logically. If the original post was not provided, the content could be very misleading, resulting in\na wrong prediction with reasons that “appears to be solid”. These examples clearly illustrate the limitations of\nthe current LLMs for mental health reasons, as well as their risks of introducing dangerous bias and negative\nconsequences to users.\nThe case study suggests that GPT-4 enjoys impressive reasoning capability, followed by GPT-3.5 and Alpaca.\nAlthough FLAN-T5 shows a promising zero-shot performance, it is not good at reasoning. Our results reveal the\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\n32:22 • Xu et al.\nencouraging capability of LLMs to understand human mental health and generate meaningful analysis. However,\nwe also present examples where LLMs can make mistakes and offer explanations that appear reasonable but are\nactually flawed. This further suggests the importance of more future research on LLMs’ ethical concerns and\nsafety issues before real-world deployment.\n6 DISCUSSION\nOur experiment results reveal a number of interesting findings. In this section, we discuss potential guidelines\nfor enabling LLMs for mental -health-related tasks (Sec. 6.1). We envision promising future directions (Sec. 6.2),\nwhile highlighting important ethical concerns and limitations with LLMs for mental health (Sec. 6.3). We also\nsummarize the limitations of the current work (Sec. 6.4).\n6.1 Guidelines for Empowering LLMs for Mental Health Prediction Tasks\nWe extract and summarize the takeaways from Sec. 5 into a set of guidelines for future researchers and practitioners\non how to empower LLMs to be better at various mental health prediction tasks.\nWhen computing resources are limited, combine prompt design & few-shot prompting, and pick\nprompts carefully. As the size of large models continues to grow, the requirement for hardware (mainly GPU)\nhas also been increasing, especially when finetuning an LLM. For example, in our experiment, Alpaca was\ntrained on eight 80GB A100s for three hours [115]. With limited computing resources, only running inferences\nor resorting to APIs is feasible. In these cases, zero-shot and few-shot prompt engineering strategies are viable\noptions. Our results indicate that providing few-shot mental health examples with appropriate enhancement\nstrategies can effectively improve prediction performance. Specifically, adding contextual information about\nthe online text data is always helpful. If the available model is large and contains rich knowledge (at least 7B\ntrainable parameters), adding mental health domain information can also be beneficial.\nWith enough computing resources, instruction finetune models on various mental health datasets.\nWhen there are enough computing resources and model training/finetuning is possible, there are more options\nto enhance LLMs for mental health prediction tasks. Our experiments clearly show that instruction finetuning\ncan significantly boost the performance of models, especially for dialogue-based models since they can better\nunderstand and learn from human natural language. When there are multiple datasets available, merging multiple\ndatasets and tasks altogether and finetuning the model in a single round is the most effective approach to enhance\nits generalizability.\nImplement efficient finetuning with hundreds of examples and prioritize data variation when data\nresource is limited. Figure 1 shows that finetuning does not require large datasets. If there is no immediately\navailable dataset, collecting small datasets with a few hundred samples is often good enough. Moreover, when\nthe overall amount of data is limited (e.g., due to resource constraints), it is more advantageous to collect data\nfrom a variety of sources, each with a smaller size, than to collect a single larger dataset. Because instruction\nfinetuning generalizes better when data and tasks have a larger variation.\nMore curated finetuning datasets are needed for mental health reasoning. Our case study suggests\nthat Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5 can only generate classification labels after being finetuned solely on\nclassification tasks, losing their reasoning capability. This is a major limitation of the current models. A potential\nsolution involves incorporating more datasets focused on reasoning or causality into the instruction finetuning\nprocess, so that models can also learn the relationship between mental health outcomes and causal factors.\nLimited Prediction and Reasoning Performance for Complex Contexts. LLMs tend to make more\nmistakes when the conversation contexts are more complex [13, 69]. Our results contextualize this in the mental\nhealth domain. Section 5.4.2 shows an example case where most LLMs not only predict incorrectly but also\nprovide flawed reasoning processes. Further analysis of mispredicted instances indicates a recurring difficulty:\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\nMental-LLM • 32:23\nLLMs often err when there’s a disconnect between the literal context and the underlying real-life scenarios.\nhe example in Figure 4 is a case where LLMs are confused by the hypothetical stressful case described by the\nperson. In another example, all LLMs incorrectly assess a person with severe depression (false negative): “I’m\njust blown away by this doctor’s willingness to help. I feel so validated every time I leave his office, like someone\nactually understands what I’m struggling with, and I don’t have to convince them of my mental illness. Bottom line?\nResearch docs if you can online, read their reviews and don’t give up until you find someone who treats you the\nway you deserve. If I can do this, I promise you can! ” Here, LLMs are misled by the outwardly positive sentiment,\noverlooking the significant cues such as regular doctor visits and explicit mentions of mental illness. These\nobservations underscore a critical shortfall of LLMs: they cannot handle complex mental health-related tasks,\nparticularly those concerning chronic conditions like depression. The variability of human expressions over\ntime and the models’ susceptibility to being swayed by superficial text rather than underlying scenarios present\nsignificant challenges.\nDespite the promising capability of LLMs for mental health tasks, they are still far from being deployable in\nthe real world. Our experiments reveal the encouraging performance of LLMs on mental health prediction and\nreasoning tasks. However, as we note in Sec. 6.3, our current results do not indicate LLMs’ deployability in real-life\nmental health settings. There are many important ethical and safety concerns and gaps before deployment to be\naddressed before achieving robustness and deployability.\n6.2 Beyond Mental Health Prediction Task and Online Text Data\nOur current experiments mainly involve mental health prediction tasks, which are essentially classification\nproblems. There are more types of tasks that our experiments don’t cover, such as regression (e.g., predicting a\nscore on a mental health scale). In particular, reasoning is an attractive task as it can fully leverage the capability\nof LLMs on language generation [18, 85]. Our initial case study on reasoning is limited but reveals promising\nperformance, especially for large models such as GPT-4. We plan to conduct more experiments on tasks that go\nbeyond classification.\nIn addition, there is another potential extension direction. In this paper, we mainly focus on online text data,\nwhich is one of the important data sources of the ubiquitous computing ecosystem. However, there are more\navailable data streams that contain rich information, such as the multimodal sensor data from mobile phones and\nwearables (e.g., [55, 78, 81, 130, 131]). This leads to another open question on how to leverage LLMs for time-series\nsensor data. More research is needed to explore potential methods to merge the online text information with\nsensor streams. These are another set of exciting research questions to explore in future work.\n6.3 Ethics in LLMs and Deployability Gaps for Mental Health\nAlthough our experiments on LLMs have shown promising capability for mental-health-related tasks, it still\nhas a long way to go before being deployed in real-life systems. Recent research has revealed the potential bias\nor even harmful advice introduced by LLMs [50], especially with the gender [42] and racial [6] gaps. In mental\nhealth, these gaps and disparities between population groups have been long-standing [54]. Meanwhile, our case\nstudy of incorrect prediction, over-generalization, and “falsely reasonable” explanations further highlight the risk\nof current LLMs. Recent studies are calling for more research emphasis and efforts in assessing and mitigating\nthese biases for mental health [54, 116].\nAlthough with a much stronger capability of understanding natural language (and early signs of mental health\ndomain knowledge in our case), LLMs are no different from other modern AI models that are trained on a large\namount of human-generated content, which exhibit all the biases that humans do [ 53, 86, 121]. Meanwhile,\nalthough we carefully picked datasets with human expert annotations, there exist potential biases in the labels,\nsuch as stereotypes [92], confirmation bias [41], normative vs. descriptive labels [11]. Besides, privacy is another\nProc. ACM Interact. Mob. Wearable Ubiquitous Technol., Vol. 8, No. 1, Article 32. Publication date: March 2024.\n32:24 • Xu et al.\nimportant concern. Although our datasets are based on public social media platforms, it is necessary to carefully\nhandle mental-health-related data and guarantee anonymity in any future efforts. These ethical concerns need\nto receive attention not only at the monitoring and prediction stage, but also in the downstream applications,\nranging from assistants for mental health experts to chatbots for end-users. Careful efforts into safe development,\nauditing, and regulation are very much needed to address these ethical risks.\n6.4 Limitations\nOur paper has a few limitations. First, although we carefully inspect the quality of our dataset and cover different\ncategories of LLM, the the range of datasets and the types of LLMs included are still limited. Our findings are\nbased on the observations of these datasets and models, which may not generalize to other cases. Related, our\nexploration of zero-shot few-shot prompt design is not comprehensive. The limited input window of some\nmodels also limits our exploration of more samples for few-shot prompting. Furthermore, we have not conducted\na systematic evaluation of these models’ performance in mental health reasoning. Future work can design\nlarger-scale experiments to include more datasets, models, prompt designs, and better evaluation.\nSecond, our datasets were mainly from Reddit, which could be limited. Although our analysis in Section 5.3.2\nshows that finetuned models have cross-platform generalizability, the finetuning was only based on Reddit and\ncan introduce bias. Meanwhile, although the labels are not directly accessible on the platforms, it is possible that\nthese text data have been included in the initial training of these large models. We still argue that there is little\ninformation leakage as long as the models haven’t seen the labels for our tasks, but it is hard to measure how the\ninitial training process may affect the outcomes in our evaluation.\nThird, another important limitation of the current work is the lack of evaluation of model fairness. Our\nanonymous datasets do not include comprehensive demographic information, making it hard to compare the\nperformance across different population groups. As we discussed in the previous section, lots of future work on\nethics and fairness is necessary before deploying such systems in real life.\n7 CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of multiple LLMs (Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, FLAN-\nT5, LLaMA2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) on mental health prediction tasks (binary and multi-class classification) via\nonline text data. Our experiments cover zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction finetuning.\nThe results reveal a number of interesting findings. Our context enhancement strategy can robustly improve\nperformance for all LLMs, and our mental health enhancement strategy can enhance models with a large number\nof trainable parameters. Meanwhile, few-shot prompting can also robustly improve model performance even by\nproviding just one example per class. Most importantly, our experiments show that instruction finetuning across\nmultiple datasets can significantly boost model performance on various mental health prediction tasks at the\nsame time, generalizing across external data sources and platforms.. Our best finetuned models, Mental-Alpaca\nand Mental-FLAN-T5, outperform much larger LLaMA2, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and perform on par with the\nstate-of-the-art task-specific model Mental-RoBERTa. We also conduct an exploratory case study on these models’\nreasoning capability, which further suggests both the promising future and the important limitations of LLMs.\nWe summarize our findings as a set of guidelines for future researchers, developers, and practitioners who want\nto empower LLMs with better knowledge of mental health for downstream tasks. Meanwhile, we emphasize that\nour current efforts of LLMs in mental health are still far from deployability. We highlight the important ethical\nconcerns accompanying this line of research.\nProc.

Small numbers represent standard deviation across different designs of PromptPart1-S and PromptPart2-Q. The\nbaselines at the top rows do not have standard deviation as the task-specific output is static, and prompt designs do not\napply. Due to token limit, computation cost, and resource constraints, some infeasible experiments are marked as “–”. For\neach column, the best result is bolded, and the second best is underlined.\nDatasetDreaddit DepSeverity SDCNL CSSRS-Suicide Red-Sam Twt-60Users SAD\nCategory Model Task #1 Task #2 Task #3 Task #4 Task #5 Task #6 Task #2 Task #2 Task #1\nZero-shot\nPrompting\nAlpaca𝑍𝑆 0.593±0.039 0.522±0.022 0.431±0.050 0.493±0.007 0.518±0.037 0.232±0.076 0.524±0.014 0.521±0.022 0.503±0.004\nAlpaca𝑍𝑆−𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 0.612±0.065 0.567±0.077 0.454±0.143 0.497±0.006 0.532±0.033 0.250±0.060 0.525±0.019 0.559±0.064 0.501±0.004\nAlpaca𝑍𝑆_𝑚ℎ 0.593±0.031 0.577±0.028 0.444±0.090 0.482±0.015 0.523±0.013 0.235±0.033 0.527±0.006 0.569±0.017 0.522±0.027\nAlpaca𝑍𝑆_𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ 0.540±0.029 0.559±0.040 0.421±0.095 0.532±0.005 0.511±0.011 0.221±0.030 0.495±0.016 0.499±0.004 0.557±0.041\nAlpaca-LoRA𝑍𝑆 0.571±0.043 0.548±0.027 0.437±0.044 0.502±0.011 0.540±0.012 0.187±0.053 0.577±0.004 0.607±0.046 0.477±0.016\nAlpaca-LoRA𝑍𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 0.537±0.047 0.501±0.001 0.343±0.152 0.472±0.020 0.567±0.038 0.214±0.059 0.535±0.017 0.649±0.021 0.443±0.047\nAlpaca-LoRA𝑍𝑆_𝑚ℎ 0.500±0.000 0.500±0.000 0.331±0.145 0.497±0.025 0.557±0.023 0.216±0.022 0.541±0.016 0.569±0.019 0.471±0.033\nAlpaca-LoRA𝑍𝑆_𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ 0.500±0.000 0.500±0.000 0.386±0.059 0.499±0.023 0.517±0.031 0.224±0.049 0.507±0.009 0.535±0.025 0.420±0.019\nFLAN-T5𝑍𝑆 0.659±0.086 0.664±0.011 0.396±0.006 0.643±0.021 0.667±0.023 0.418±0.012 0.554±0.034 0.613±0.040 0.692±0.093\nFLAN-T5𝑍𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 0.663±0.079 0.674±0.014 0.378±0.013 0.653±0.011 0.649±0.026 0.378±0.029 0.563±0.029 0.613±0.046 0.738±0.056\nFLAN-T5𝑍𝑆_𝑚ℎ 0.616±0.070 0.666±0.009 0.366±0.012 0.648±0.010 0.653±0.018 0.372±0.033 0.547±0.035 0.613±0.033 0.739±0.039\nFLAN-T5𝑍𝑆_𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ 0.604±0.074 0.661±0.004 0.389±0.051 0.645±0.005 0.657±0.019 0.382±0.048 0.536±0.027 0.606±0.040 0.767±0.050\nLLaMA2𝑍𝑆 0.720±0.012 0.693±0.034 0.429±0.013 0.589±0.010 0.691±0.014 0.261±0.018 0.574±0.008 0.735±0.017 0.704±0.026\nLLaMA2𝑍𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 0.658±0.025 0.707±0.056 0.410±0.019 0.588±0.026 0.722±0.039 0.367±0.043 0.562±0.011 0.736±0.019 0.650±0.027\nLLaMA2𝑍𝑆_𝑚ℎ 0.617±0.012 0.711±0.033 0.395±0.017 0.642±0.008 0.696±0.021 0.291±0.038 0.572±0.012 0.689±0.056 0.567±0.021\nLLaMA2𝑍𝑆_𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ 0.584±0.017 0.704±0.036 0.444±0.021 0.643±0.014 0.689±0.043 0.328±0.058 0.559±0.012 0.692±0.069 0.560±0.009\nGPT-3.5𝑍𝑆 0.685±0.024 0.642±0.017 0.603±0.017 0.460±0.163 0.570±0.118 0.233±0.009 0.454±0.007 0.536±0.024 0.717±0.017\nGPT-3.5𝑍𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 0.688±0.045 0.653±0.020 0.543±0.047 0.618±0.008 0.577±0.090 0.265±0.048 0.473±0.001 0.560±0.002 0.723±0.003\nGPT-3.5𝑍𝑆_𝑚ℎ 0.679±0.017 0.636±0.021 0.642±0.034 0.576±0.001 0.477±0.014 0.310±0.015 0.467±0.004 0.571±0.000 0.664±0.061\nGPT-3.5𝑍𝑆_𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ 0.681±0.010 0.627±0.022 0.617±0.014 0.632±0.020 0.617±0.033 0.254±0.009 0.506±0.004 0.570±0.007 0.750±0.027\nGPT-4𝑍𝑆 0.700±0.001 0.719±0.013 0.588±0.010 0.644±0.007 0.760±0.009 0.418±0.009 0.434±0.005 0.566±0.017 0.854±0.006\nGPT-4𝑍𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 0.706±0.009 0.719±0.009 0.590±0.011 0.644±0.011 0.753±0.028 0.441±0.057 0.465±0.010 0.565±0.006 0.848±0.001\nGPT-4𝑍𝑆_𝑚ℎ 0.725±0.009 0.684±0.004 0.656±0.001 0.645±0.012 0.737±0.005 0.396±0.020 0.496±0.005 0.527±0.007 0.840±0.003\nGPT-4𝑍𝑆_𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ 0.719±0.021 0.689±0.000 0.650±0.011 0.647±0.014 0.697±0.005 0.411±0.009 0.511±0.000 0.546±0.014 0.837±0.002\nFew-shot\nPrompting\nAlpaca𝐹𝑆 0.632±0.030 0.529±0.017 0.628±0.005 — — — — — —\nFLAN-T5𝐹𝑆 0.786±0.006 0.678±0.009 0.432±0.009 — — — — — —\nGPT-3.5𝐹𝑆 0.721±0.010 0.665±0.015 0.580±0.002 — — — — — —\nGPT-4𝐹𝑆 0.698±0.009 0.724±0.005 0.613±0.001 — — — — — —\nInstructional\nFinetuning\nMental-Alpaca 0.816±0.006 0.775±0.006 0.746±0.005 0.724±0.004 0.730±0.048 0.403±0.029 0.604±0.012 0.718±0.011 0.819±0.006\nMental-FLAN-T5 0.802±0.002 0.759±0.003 0.756±0.001 0.677±0.005 0.868±0.006 0.481±0.006 0.582±0.002 0.736±0.003 0.779±0.002\nBaseline\nMajority 0.500 ±−−− 0.500±−−− 0.250±−−− 0.500±−−− 0.500±−−− 0.200±−−− — — —\nBERT 0.783 ±−−− 0.763±−−− 0.690±−−− 0.678±−−− 0.500±−−− 0.332±−−− — — —\nMental-RoBERTa0.831±−−−0.790±−−−0.736±−−− 0.723±−−− 0.853±−−− 0.373±−−− — — —\nProc.
