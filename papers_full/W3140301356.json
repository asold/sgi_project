  "abstract": "The current transformers with split-core are used for installation in places where it is impossible to install classic current transformers. Moreover, this design allows for any measurement location change, and even switching one current transformer into several different shapes of bars or cables. Power network operators, striving for more accurate current measurements, require producers to provide current transformers with a special accuracy class 0.2S. Therefore, manufacturers and designers try to meet the market requirements and, similarly to non-demountable current transformers, i.e., with a toroidal core, design current transformers with split-core class 0.2S. To meet the high metrological requirements, 3D analyses of electromagnetic fields were performed, taking into account physical phenomena and not approximate analytical models. Two types of cores and four different arrangements of the secondary windings of the measuring current transformers were considered. The magnetic field distributions, current error, and phase displacement diagrams of all current transformer models were analyzed, and the model of the transformer structure with the best accuracy was selected. Computations were conducted based on the finite element numerical method, and the results were compared with the real model tests.",
