    "abstract": "The increasing demand for more sophisticated and contextually aware language generation has highlighted the limitations of traditional language models, which often struggle to maintain relevance and accuracy across diverse and dynamic contexts. The novel concept of reverse prompt engineering, introduced in this research, represents a significant breakthrough by enabling the generation of prompts that are retrospectively aligned with desired outputs, thereby enhancing the model's ability to adapt to varying contexts with precision. Through the fine-tuning of the Mistral model, combined with the integration of reverse prompt engineering, the research achieved substantial improvements in context-specific language generation, demonstrating the model's enhanced performance across a wide range of tasks, including summarization, translation, and question answering. The results demonstrate the importance of context-specific modeling and adaptive prompt generation, which together contribute to a more accurate and contextually relevant language output, offering a robust framework for future advancements in language model development. The methodologies developed in this study not only advance the current understanding of context adaptation in language models but also pave the way for more versatile and scalable applications across various domains.",
