INTRODUCTION\nEstimation of a transformer’s health requires thermal moni-\ntoring of winding insulation by tracking the incipient activi-\nties. These incipient faults in a transformer rise gradually with\nthe passage of time and if necessary actions are not taken, can\ncause catastrophic failures. Partial discharges (PD) is one of\nthe most encountered incipient activity in power transformers\nwhich indicates the growth of some precarious activity inside\nthe transformer tank. PD is the root cause in the deterio-\nration of electrical and mechanical strength of transformer\nwinding insulation. Therefore, it must be mitigated in initial\nstages [1].\nThe PD activity is predominantly accompanied by thermal\nevents such as the creation of local hot-spots. The voids where\nPD activity takes place are randomly distributed and it is dif-\nﬁcult to indicate their actual location and therefore the top oil\ntemperature is the best indicator for any PD activity within the\ntransformer winding. It has been documented that the maxi-\nmum top oil temperature can reach about 100 ◦C to 110◦C [2].\nSimilarly, the hot-spot temperature (HST) depends on the\nmagnitude and re-occurrence of PD activity during contin-\nuous voltage application [3] and is a critical factor which\nresults in the deterioration of winding insulation [4].\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Dwarkadas Pralhaddas Kothari.\nAn accurate estimation of the winding HST is required to\nassess the health of power transformer. It is one of the critical\nlimiting factors for transformer loading, thus it increases the\nsigniﬁcance of determining the HST at every moment of\ntransformer operation with real load condition and ambient\ntemperature [5]. There are two possible methods for deter-\nmining the HST. One of them is using ﬁber optic temperature\nsensors placed in the intended hotspot of the windings [6], [7].\nThermal sensors, attached to the end of the optical ﬁber,\nare usually placed between the insulated conductor and the\nspacer and the optical ﬁber signals are transmitted out of the\ntank. However, the cost penalty due to the sensor installation\nsometimes becomes difﬁcult to justify. Furthermore, it is not\npractical to adapt this technique into already assembled trans-\nformer units. Another difﬁculty with the direct measurement\ntechnique is to accurately locate the hotspot position and opti-\nmum sensor deployment [8], [9]. The second method which\nis a statistical approach determined by calculating the internal\ntemperature of the transformer (HST) is a very complicated\nand a difﬁcult task [10]–[12].\nA signiﬁcant amount of work has been done on predicting\nthe winding HST [13]. The most commonly used hotspot\nthermal model is presented in the clause 7 of IEEE loading\nguide manual [14]. Moreover, Swift et al. [15] suggested a\nmethodology to use the IEEE clause 7 model based on the\nfundamentals of heat transfer theory. Susa et al.

Aslamet al.: Dynamic Thermal Model for Power Transformers\nTABLE 1. Classification of different techniques for estimation of hot spot temperature.\npresented a more accurate thermal model of transformer\nby considering the dynamic load conditions. An analogous\napproach has been used by Elmoudi et al. [18]–[20] to\ndevelop a simpliﬁed thermal-electrical equivalent mathemat-\nical models to calculate the real time top oil and hotspot\ntemperatures of a substation transformer.\nThe hot-spot temperature has a direct effect on the mechan-\nical and electrical strengths of transformer winding insu-\nlation [21]. Utilizing the accuracy of the dynamic thermal\nmodels, the hot spot temperature can be used to monitor\nthe winding insulation for the transformer. Various compu-\ntational methods and engineering models proposed for trans-\nformers and accurate prediction of their features are classiﬁed\ninto four main groups as shown in the table 1.\nPartial discharges, as discussed earlier, occur in voids\nand defects inside the insulation and is accompanied by\ngeneration of frequency noise which results in deteriorat-\ning the insulation, so in order to better understand the phe-\nnomenon of PD inside the transformer winding insulation,\nthe most cost effective approach is the computer based mod-\nelling and simulation. This approach is widely adopted by\nthe industries for the condition assessment and estimation\nof life of the transformers [22]. Simulation models can por-\ntray an accurate estimation of the real-time behavior of any\nequipment.\nThe proposed research attempts to compare different exist-\ning thermal models of transformers and developing a gener-\nalized thermal model for power transformer which is capable\nof identifying the hotspot temperature and top oil temper-\nature by taking into account the ambient temperature and\nthe load variation. The thermal model is validated using the\nexperimental results obtained by varying the load current on\n71462 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM. Aslamet al.: Dynamic Thermal Model for Power Transformers\nTABLE 2. Comparison table of various thermal models for transformers.\ndifferent phases of the transformer. The real-time application\nprovides an accurate picture of the operation condition of\nthe transformer, which allows the operator to detect early\nsigns of failure. A signiﬁcant advantage of the proposed\nthermal model is that unlike other models, the ambient tem-\nperature is considered variable. Moreover, the model can\neffectively explain the temperature dependent factors. Fur-\nthermore, the model has been developed for in-service trans-\nformer. To the best of the knowledge of the authors, this has\nnot been attempted in previous publications.\nII. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS THERMAL\nMODELS\nA comparison of different thermal models with the proposed\nthermal model is carried out to extract the parameters that\ncharacterize the thermal model from on-line measurements\nto avoid shutdown of the transformers during operation as\nshown in table 2.\nIII. DEVELOPMENT OF PROPOSED THERMAL MODEL\nA thermal insulation model for oil-immersed 10 KV A,\n1100/400V, 50 Hz distribution transformer is developed in\nMATLAB Simulink that employs the hot spot temperature\nfrom the dynamic thermal model of the transformer and then\ncompared with the IEEE thermal guideline model. The two\nimportant general properties of the transformer oil are its\nheat capacity and thermal conductivity. These properties are\nﬁxed for a particular volume of oil, and hence can be used\nas thermal capacitance and thermal resistance. According to\nthe electrical laws for deﬁning a resistance and capacitance,\nwe have:\nv =i.R & i =C.dv\ndt (1)\nThe corresponding thermal laws are\nθ =Rth.q & q =Cth.dθ\ndt (2)\nFIGURE 1. RC circuit for transformer [4].\nA. TOP-OIL MODEL\nTop-oil modelling is based on the fundamentals of oil-air\nmodel. Fig 1 shows the electrical equivalent thermal model of\ntransformer top-oil, i.e. between the transformer top-oil and\nambient temperature surrounding the transformer steel tank.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 71463\nM. Aslamet al.: Dynamic Thermal Model for Power Transformers\nFIGURE 2. Simulink model for top oil temperature.\nAll the transformer losses are current sources injecting\nheat into the system. The thermal capacitance is shown as a\nlumped capacitance and the thermal resistance is shows as\na non-linear term. The differential equation representing the\ntop-oil model is:\nqin =Cth−oil\ndθoil\ndt + 1\nRth−oil\n.[θoil −θamb]1/n (3)\nwhere,\nqin the heat generated by total losses, W\nCth−oil the oil thermal capacitance, W.min/ ◦C\nRth−oil the thermal resistance, ◦C/W\nθoil the top-oil temperature, ◦C\nθamb the ambient temperature, ◦C\nn non-linearity exponent\nqin.Rth−oil =Rth−oil .Cth−oil\ndθoil\ndt +[θoil −θamb]\n1\nn (4)\nOr\nqin.Rth−oil =Toil\ndθoil\ndt +[θoil −θamb]\n1\nn (5)\nEquation (5) can be reduced as:\nI2\npuβ+1\nβ+1 [1θoil−R]1/n =τoil\ndθoil\ndt +[θoil −θamb]1/n (6)\nwhere,\nIpu the load current as a function of time\nβ the ratio of load to no-load losses\nτoil the top-oil time constant, min\n1θoil−R the rated top-oil rise over ambient\ntemperature, K.\nEquation (4) is a non-linear, ﬁrst order, non-homogeneous\ndifferential equation with numerical solution possible. The\ncomplementary part of the solution, however, will have a\ngeneral form that contains an exponential function. Based\non equation (6), a Simulink model has been developed in\nMATLAB as shown in ﬁg.2.\nWhere as in ﬁg.2 ‘‘T_amb (Ambient temperature)’’, ‘‘Load\nCurrent (pu)’’, ‘‘Tt_O (top-oil constant)’’ and ‘‘theta_o_R\n(Rated top-oil rise over ambient temperature)’’ are the\ninput variables and give us the required top-oil temperature\n‘‘Theta_TO’’ as output by solving the formula through math-\nematical blocks in Simulink. The ratio of load to no-load\nlosses was obtained by knowing the no-load and full-load cur-\nrent from the nameplate and the impedance of secondary and\nprimary windings in addition to the magnetizing resistance\nand reactance.\nThe time constant and the value of exponent ‘‘n’’ were\nobtained by performing a heat-run test on the transformer\nat quality control laboratory of Heavy Electrical Com-\nplex (HEC) Taxila, Pakistan. For the heat-run test, the newly\nmanufactured power transformer 10KV A, 11/0.4kV, which\npassed all the required quality control tests was loaded by\nconnecting dummy load based on oil cooled variable resis-\ntors so as allow the temperature of the oil in transformer\nto increase to a value of +65◦C (the allowed rated max-\nimum operating temperature limit by PESCO). The load\non the transformer was then removed and the transformer\nwas allowed to remain energized under no-load condition to\nmonitor the drop in oil temperature to the desired ambient\ntemperature of 24◦C. The total time taken for the temperature\nto decay to the value of desired room temperature was noted\nin steps of each minute time-frame. The time taken for the\n71464 VOLUME 9, 2021\nM.

WINDING HOTSPOT TEMPERATURE MODEL\nHot-spots are concentrated localized high temperature\nregions in transformer winding assembly which may be the\nresult of cumulative PD activity. The modeling of hot-spots is\nbased on the fundamentals principle of winding-to-oil model\nconstituting an RC circuit with current source representing\nheat ﬂow and a voltage source that represent temperature as\nshown in Figure.1. Like the top-oil model, the hot-spot model\nhas also been implemented as a simple RC circuit to analyze\nthe hot-spot temperature θhs. The transformer winding losses\nare shown as current source injecting heat into the system at\nthe hot-spot location. The thermal capacitance of the oil is\nshown as a lumped capacitance and the thermal resistance\nof the insulation is shows as a non-linear term. Here the\nexponent deﬁning the non-linearity will be m i.e. the coolant\nis oil. The differential equation representing the hot-spot\nmodel is,\nqhs =Cth−hs\ndθhs\ndt + 1\nRth−hs\n.[θhs −θoil ]1/m (7)\nwhere,\nqhs the heat generated by winding losses at hot-spot\nlocation, W.\nCth−hs the winding thermal capacitance at the hot-spot\nlocation, W.min/◦C\nRth−hs the thermal resistance at the hot-spot location,\n◦C/W\nFIGURE 4.

MODEL SIMULATION\nA. INPUT VARIABLES FOR THE PROPOSED MODEL\nThe daily load cycles per unit for each phase of the trans-\nformer and the ambient temperature as a function of time\nwere measured using SEL-2414 monitoring device as shown\nin ﬁg 4 and 5. Additionally, both the top-oil temperature and\nhot-spot temperature, which were recorded during a varying\nload current, are compared with the results obtained from the\nSimulink model.\nIt can be seen from the graph in ﬁg 4 and ﬁg 5, that the\npeaks; load and ambient temperature does not coincide with\ntime. This would mean that the ambient temperature and load\ncycle are independent and are not function of each other. The\nparameters for the top oil and hot spot models are taken from\nthe name plate of the transformer and shown in table 3.\nV. MODEL VALIDATION\nA. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nIn the proposed model, the input data required for the model\nis the daily load cycles (load current) and the ambient\nTABLE 3.

As the model is based on the predic-\ntion of real-time behaviour of the transformer, therefore,\nthe real-time data has been taken from the distribution trans-\nformer. To measure the internal temperature of the trans-\nformer, we considered two distribution transformers:\n1) 15KV A, used for the generation of 11KV line in the\nlaboratory.\n2) 10 KV A transformer used for the analysis in the\nexperiment.\nThe entire setup installed in the High Voltage Laboratory\nlocated at the University of Engineering and Technology,\nPeshawar, Pakistan and data has been collected by installing\n(SEL)-2414 Transformer Monitor device by Schweitzer\nEngineering Laboratories.

In order to acquire reliable ﬁeld data, a three-phase,\n50Hz, 10/13 MV A, 132/11 kV power transformer installed at\n500kV Sheikh Muhammadi sub-station, Peshawar, Pakistan\nwas considered and the same unit-2414 also installed as\nshown in ﬁg 8.\nB.

The simulated\nresults of the proposed thermal model are in good agreement\nwith the measured values, showing good accuracy in case of\ntop oil temperature and hotspot temperature.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nA Dynamic thermal model for Power transformers is pre-\nsented in this paper. For the ﬁrst time, a real-time exper-\nimental validation has been implemented for the dynamic\nthermal model. Thermal model is developed for the prediction\nof hot spot and top oil temperature of power transformers in\nSimulink MATLAB. Unlike the previously reported models,\nthe proposed model takes into account the effect of vary-\ning load and ambient temperatures. For model validation\nan experimental setup was implemented at University of\nEngineering and Technology Peshawar Pakistan and Shiekh\nmohammadi Grid Station Peshawar respectively. Moreover,\nthe state of the art IEEE model is used for model valida-\ntion. As compared to the other thermal models, the analysis\nmethodology presented in this study is based on the physical\ncondition of the transformer and a real-time thermal monitor-\ning results are visualized by utilizing the real-time data of a\nsubstation power transformer and a distribution transformer.\nThe results predicted by the proposed model are in good\nagreement with the experimental and ﬁeld based data. The\nmodel is demonstrably predicting the hotspot and top oil\ntemperature successfully in the tests conducted. The model\nhas been validated by comparison of the simulation and ﬁeld\ndata and exhibits signiﬁcant enhancement over the existing\nmodels in prediction of the top oil and hotspot temperatures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors acknowledge the technical support provided\nby the management of Sheikh Muhammadi substation,\nPeshawar, Pakistan, in the collection of real time data from\npower transformers.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
