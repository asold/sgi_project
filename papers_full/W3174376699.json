  "abstract": "Overvoltage transients occur after any type of switching activity in a power network, such as breaker operation, fault occurrence/clearance and rapid load change. This distortion of voltage is transformed to the secondary circuit of a voltage transformer. The maximum values of such impulses may many times exceed the rated value of its secondary voltage. This can lead to malfunction of measuring or protection devices connected to the secondary circuit of a voltage transformer and even their damage. The paper presents the application of determined values of ratio error at harmonics of the inductive voltage of the transformer to predict the value of transformed slow-front transient overvoltage to their secondary circuits. This will help to prevent malfunction of measuring or protection devices connected to the secondary side of the voltage transformer and increase their safety of operation. The inductive voltage transformer equivalent circuit for transformation of higher frequency components of distorted voltage must be extended with internal capacitances of windings. This is caused by the fact that the resonance phenomenon of the slow-front transient overvoltage results from leakage inductance and capacitance of primary winding, not from the magnetic core. Therefore, this behaviour is independent from the value of the applied voltage.",
