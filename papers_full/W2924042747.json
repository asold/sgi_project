The objectives of the emergency ser-\nvices facing these situations are primarily tactical,\nwhether on the field or at the hospital door, and include\nreducing the morbidity and mortality of those exposed\nand limiting the risk for workers and care structures [ 3].\nTheir success meets the strategic and national objectives\nto minimize people ’s panic and, as a result, the political\neffects. One of the challenges of emergency system\npersonnel, who are the first responders, is to maintain\nthe high level of performance required of pre-hospital\nand hospital workers, whether or not they are care pro-\nviders [ 4]. However, effective preparation remains com-\nplex due to the low level of evidence to support tactical\nconcepts, the pedagogical and logistical challenges of\nsimulating the agents involved, and the scarcity of\nexperts.\nThe CBRN chain of survival\nThe Paris Fire Brigade is confronted with these chal-\nlenges at different levels of intervention, including the\nPrimary Security and Answer Point, Basic and Advanced\nLife Support, and Emergency Medical and Crisis\nDispatch, for an 800 km 2 area and seven million inhabi-\ntants. Thus, the Paris Fire Brigade developed a cognitive\ntool to model the actions to be performed by first\nresponders, so that simple and effective actions can be\ncarried out in a precise order [ 5]. This article describes\nthe survival chain for CBRN situations using analogies\nto existing survival chains (Fig. 1)[ 6, 7]. This chain is\nbased on a known concept; therefore, we hope that its\nmemorization will be easy and prolonged. Its yellow\ncolor is reminiscent of the classic CBRN logo. Like the\nsurvival chain of cardiac arrest, it is the weakest link in\nthe chain that determines its overall robustness; thus,\nthe first link is of predominant importance [ 8]. This\nchain could be used for public communication in time\nof crisis. Finally, this five-linked model provides a stand-\nard reference framework for both research and compari-\nsons of practices in international healthcare systems.\nThis is the first common basis for the creation of a regis-\nter of contaminated persons. This current opinion de-\nscribes the data supporting each link and recommends\nspecific actions to strengthen the CBRN chain of\nsurvival.\nThe first link is the Spot Decontamination Link to pre-\nvent the spread of contamination [ 9, 10]. This link aims\nto reduce, as much as possible, the contamination\npresent on the surface of victims to avoid the transfer of\ncontamination to their internal environment through\ndermal or respiratory routes, or the transfer to teams\nand care facilities. It must be carried out as quickly as\npossible, given the rapid penetration of toxic substances.\nIt is carried out by the patients themselves if they are\nable-bodied, or by rescuers when the victims are dis-\nabled. This decontamination involves the extraction of\nthe contaminated area, the installation of an FFP2 re-\nspiratory mask, and the removal of the first layer of\n* Correspondence: clement.derkenne@pompiersparis.fr\n1Emergency Medical Department, Paris Fire Brigade, 1 Place Jules Renard,\n75017 Paris, France\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2019 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

The exposed parts are decontaminated with a\nhyper-absorbent material or skin decontamination\nlotion.\nNext is the Early Toxidrom Recognition Link to pre-\npare care system. First, responders must quickly\ncharacterize chemical, radiological, or biological agents.\nThe identification, even if supposed and unconfirmed, of\nan agent makes it possible to immediately address the\nemergency situation and to specify the nature of the risk\nto hospitals that will probably already be confronted\nwith the spontaneous arrival of victims. Logistical (vol-\nume and nature of antidote), tactical (adaptation of pro-\ntective clothing, persistence or not of the agent in\nquestion), and strategic (evacuation of areas) provisions\ndepend on this link, for example, in a “powder envelop ”\nsituation [ 11, 12]. For chemical agents, this may involve\nsearching for several symptoms in the same patient or\nfor the same symptom in several patients. A dispropor-\ntion between the high number of victims and the low\npower of an explosion, the presence of an “epileptic epi-\ndemic,” dyspnea, or ocular or neurological signs associ-\nated with toxidromes are highly suggestive [ 13]. For\nbiological and radiological risks, and for some chemicals\n(e.g., Yperite), there are no early symptoms. Portable\nchemical, radiological, and biological detection devices\nexist, but are often imperfect [ 14]. For chemicals, the\nimpurity of non-industrial products, their modification\nby the dissemination vector (e.g., explosion), and their\nassociation with other chemicals can make identification\ndifficult; in the same way, odors traditionally attributed\nto chemicals are not reliable.\nNext, the Early Antidotes Link can prevent deaths.\nUndressed victims are sorted to separate injured or\nsymptomatic victims from others. The administration of\nspecific antidotes (e.g., atropine, hydroxocobalamin)\nshould not delay the symptomatic treatment of distress\n[15]. In cases of radiological and biological risk, except\ntoxins, antidotes may exist but their use may be deferred\nuntil advised by an expert.\nThe Extensive Decontamination Link protects the\nhealthcare system. The use of thorough decontamin-\nation lines (water and deter gent) is only necessary for\nsolid or liquid agents. Due to the long implementa-\ntion time (often over 60 min), they contribute very lit-\ntle to improving the individual prognosis of victims.\nDespite often contrary beliefs by first responders and\nthe public, they are only of real interest to protect\nhospitals from possible contamination transfer. If the\nsupposed agent is non-persistent (gaseous), it will be\npossible to stay at this link and accelerate the evacu-\nation of victims to hospitals. After thorough decon-\ntamination, victims are considered non-contaminating\nand can be treated without any specific protective\nmeasures for the caregivers.\nThe Evacuation to the Hospital Link completes the\ncare. The decontamination of “chemical emergencies ”\ntakes precedence over medical and surgical emergencies,\nbut this is not the case for radio-contaminated patients\nwith critical medical and surgical conditions. After spot\ndecontamination, they can be evacuated in extreme\nurgency using double packaging that limits the transfer\nof contamination to caregivers and hospital structures.\nThorough decontamination will be carried out after\nmedical and surgical survival procedures.\nConclusion\nThe CBRN events are probably more of a means of\ndisorganization and major terror than of mass destruc-\ntion. During crisis situations, decision-making is most\neffective when the simplest and most effective ideas are\nused. The decreased cognitive performance of crisis\nroom leaders and on-the-field emergency services in-\nduced by intense stress highlights the major importance\nof a “cognitive lifeline. ” The CBRN survival chain is a\ndidactic tool that supports the learning of five essential,\ninseparable, and ordered links in the care of victims in a\nCBRN situation.\nFig. 1 Sequence of events in CBRN situations is displayed schematically by “CBRN chain of survival ” metaphor\nCalamai et al.
