  "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to develop an improved three-phase transformer model for ATP and parameter estimation methods that can efficiently utilize the limited available information such as factory test reports. In this paper, improved topologically-correct duality-based models are developed for three-phase autotransformers having shell-form cores. The problem in the implementation of detailed models is the lack of complete and reliable data. Therefore, parameter estimation methods are developed to determine the parameters of a given model in cases where available information is incomplete. The transformer nameplate data is required and relative physical dimensions of the core are estimated. The models include a separate representation of each segment of the core, including hysteresis of the core, <TEX>${\\lambda}-i$</TEX> saturation characteristic and core loss.",
