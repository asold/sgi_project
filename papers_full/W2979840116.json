    "abstract": "A high level of insulation moisture in a transformer increases the breakdown probability and forces a reduction of its load. Therefore, there is a need to dry the transformer insulation. For technical reasons, there are some restrictions on the use of common drying methods for cellulose insulation available on the market. The aim of the research was to check the possibility of using synthetic ester for effective drying of cellulose materials of various thickness and an evaluation of the drying dynamics. The replacement of mineral oil with a synthetic ester caused a reduction of moisture in paper and thin pressboard by one percentage point. It was possible in the case of drying these materials for seven days at a temperature of 70 °C. The effects of drying were much smaller in the case of thicker cellulose samples. This paper also shows the complex problem of simultaneously drying materials of different thicknesses. Drying thin paper and thick pressboard at the same time significantly slows down the drying process of the pressboard. Presented results will be used to develop a procedure for drying the transformer insulation system using a synthetic ester.",
