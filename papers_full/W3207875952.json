The faults of any power transformer online could cause considerable damage to the\npower system and lead to the interruption of the power supply. Therefore, the early detection of faults\nin transformers is vital to improving the reliability of the power system. Suffered the electrical and\nthermal stress during the operation, the transformer oil and organic insulating inside the transformer\nwill be decomposed and generate different gases. Commonly, these dissolved gases include hydrogen\n(H\n2), methane (CH4), acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6) and can provide abundant\ninformation about the internal states of the transformer. Based on the gas chromatography methods,\nthe composition of the dissolved gases can be qualitatively and quantitatively measured and then\nused for the identiﬁcation of the latent fault. There are three main kinds of chromatographic analysis\nmethod (Cheng and Yu, 2018) of dissolved gases namely the characteristic gas method (Fu et al.,\n2012), the gas production rate method (Nogami et al., 1995;X iChen et al., 2010; Zeng et al., 2011),\nand the three-ratio method (Jiang et al., 2014; Dhote and Helonde, 2012; Liu et al., 2020). The above\nmethods generally utilize the concentration of a speciﬁc gaseous molecule or the ratios of several\ndifferent molecules indicate the state of a power transformer (Shang et al., 2019).

Energy Res. 9:745744.\ndoi: 10.3389/fenrg.2021.745744\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 7457441\nORIGINAL RESEARCH\npublished: 08 October 2021\ndoi: 10.3389/fenrg.2021.745744\nimproved methods have been proposed and applied for\ntransformer fault diagnosis, including the Roger method\n(Ghoneim et al., 2016), the basic triangular diagram ( Singh\nand Bandyopadhyay, 2010), the dual triangle method (Shang\net al., 2019), etc. However, these methods have their inherent\nshortcomings. For example, most of these traditional\ndiagnosis methods only make a limited contribution to a\ntransformer’s fault diagnosis due to low diagnostic accuracy\n(Yadaiah and Ravi, 2011 ). Meanwhile, the three-ratio and\nimproved three-ratio methods have disadvantages of\nincomplete coding and excessively absolute coding boundary\n(Cheng and Yu, 2018 ). Therefore, due to these defects of\ntraditional methods, it is necessary to investigate new\ntransformer fault diagnosis methods.\nWith the rapid development of computer science and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms, many models are\nconducted by combining intelligence techniques with DGA\nmethods to accurately detect fault types. The utilization of\nartiﬁcial neural network (ANN) (Colorado et al., 2011; Bhalla\net al., 2012; Yi et al., 2016; Meng et al., 2010 ; Castro and\nMiranda, 2005 ; Miranda and Castro, 2005 ; Souahlia et al.,\n2012), expert system (Lin et al., 1993; Wang et al., 2000; Saha\nand Purkait, 2004; Mani and Jerome, 2014; Li et al., 2009),\nfuzzy theory (Huang et al., 1997; Moﬁzul Islam et al., 2000;\nZhou et al., 1997; Fan et al., 2017; Naresh et al., 2008), grey\nsystem (Dong et al., 2003; Cheng et al., 2018), support vector\nmachine (SVM) (Fei and Zhang, 2009; Fei et al., 2009; Liu et al.,\n2016;N i uWu et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2011) and other theories\nhave signi ﬁcantly improved the accuracy of fault\nidenti ﬁcation. However, de ﬁciencies occur together with\nthese intelligent diagnostic approaches. Based on the ANN\nmethod, the intelligent fault diagnostic method is susceptible\nto be overﬁtting and may get a local optimum (Yuan et al.,\n2019). As for the expert system, the accuracy of this diagnostic\nmethod depends on the completeness of the expert knowledge,\nand this method cannot learn from new data samples\nautomatically (Weigen Chen et al., 2009\n). In addition, fuzzy\ntheory depends exceedingly on the experience of the researcher\nand is difﬁcult to acquire an appropriate relationship between\nthe input and output variables (Žarkovi ć and Stojković,2 0 1 7).\nSVM is originally a binary classi ﬁcation algorithm which\nmakes it dif ﬁcult to determine the parameters for multi-\nclassiﬁcation problem (Zhu et al., 2018). A single intelligent\napproach for transformer fa ult diagnosis has various\nshortcomings and can not reﬂect all the operation status of\nthe transformer. Various intelligent algorithms can be\ncombined to form a hybrid network for mutual\ncomplementation to solve complex problems, which has\nbeen applied in electricity. Researchers in ( Xi et al., 2020 )\nproposed a deep-reinforcement-learning-based three-network\ndouble-delay actor-critic (TDAC) control strategy for the\nautomatic generation control (AGC) to deal with the strong\nrandom disturbance issues caused by renewable energy.\nResearchers in ( Zhang et al., 2020 ) proposed a predictive\ncontrol (MPC) based model combined with real-time\noptimal mileage based dispatch (OMD) for generating\ncompany responding to AGC dispatch signals in real-time.\nThe above hybrid networks perform excellently in dealing with\ncomplex problems. As for the transformer fault diagnosis, a\ndiagnostic method can be conducted with a hybrid network\nthat combines different algorithms.\nTo achieve the objective of improving the accuracy of\ntransformer fault diagnosis, a machine learning algorithm\nnamed XGBoost was employed as the classi ﬁer for the\ntransformer fault identi ﬁcation in this paper, which is a\nscalable end-to-end tree boosting system (Chen and Guestrin,\n2016). An improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is used for input\nfeature selection and the XGBoost ’s optimization. Then an\nintelligent diagnostic method based on the combination of the\nIGA and the XGBoost classiﬁer (IGA-XGBoost) is built. The\nremainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section 2presents\nthe details of the proposed method, andsection 3 shows the\nexperimental results and performance analysis.Section 4 is the\nconclusion of this paper.\n2 PROPOSED METHODS\nIn this section, the proposed method for power transformer faults\ndetection and recognition is explained in detail. Different\nmethods based on the arti ﬁcial intelligence algorithms and\nDGA methods have been proposed to classify transformer\nfaults, and the most signi ﬁcant issue which impacts the\naccuracy of fault classiﬁcation is the appropriate selection of\ninput features and classiﬁers (Tightiz et al., 2020). Consideration\nhas been given to these two aspects in the proposed method.\n2.1 Candidate Input Features\nIntelligent transformer faults diagnosis methods proposed by\nother researchers commonly combine DGA methods with\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms in the last decades. The gas\nratios or gas concentrations used in DGA methods are\nadopted as the inputs of these intelligent fault diagnosis\nmethods. Nonetheless, not all the gas ratios or gas\nconcentrations have the same signi ﬁcance for fault\nidenti ﬁcation. Using uninformative features as inputs leads\nto artiﬁcial noise and poor performance in transformer faults\ndiagnosis. Hence, effective features should be selected as the\ninput, and uninformative features must be removed. In this\nstudy, following the traditional DGA methods, the\nconcentrations of the dissolved gases or the ratios of\nseveral different gases are collected as candidate feature set\nfor the input feature selection, as shown inTable 1.I nTable 1,\nTH /equals CH\n4 + C2H4 + C2H2 and TH1 /equals CH4 + C2H4 +\nC2H2 + C2H6.\nTABLE 1 |The candidate feature set for intelligent fault diagnosis methods.

Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis\n2.2 Genetic Algorithm\n2.2.1 Tradtional Genetic Algorithm and Improved\nGenetic Algorithm\nIt is common practice to separate the process of input feature\nselection from the classiﬁer optimization process, which neglects\ninteraction between the feature selection and the classi ﬁer\noptimization may lead to unreliable results (Daelemans et al.,\n2003). Combined optimization of the feature selection and the\nclassiﬁer’ parameters can be achieved by genetic algorithm within\na single approach. Since the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA) is\nprone to get trapped in the local optimal and fails toﬁnd the optimal\nglobal solution. In this paper, some improvements have been made to\nthe TGA to enhance its global search capability, and an IGA is\nobtained. The IGA is utilized to combine the feature selection process\nwith the classiﬁer optimization process and assess which combination\nof input features and classiﬁer’s parameters substantially impact the\naccuracy of fault diagnosis to gain the optimal input features and the\nclassiﬁer’s parameters. The difference between the TGA and the IGA\nis shown inFigure 1. Figure 1Ashows the structure of the TGA, and\nFigure 1Bshows the structure of the IGA. From 1A, it can be found\nthat the main processes of the TGA include the population selection\nprocess and the population reproduction process. Two modiﬁcations\nm a k et h eI G Ad i f f e rf r o mt h eT G A :t h eh i g hm u t a t i o nr a t eo f0 . 3 ,a n d\nthe other is the addition of elitist selection in the population selection\nprocess.\nIn the population selection process of the TGA, the generation\nof candidate solutions after initialization is called the population.\nEach individual of the generated population has its chromosome\ncoding to represent the parameters of the classiﬁer and the input\nfeatures extracted from DGA data, as shown inFigure 2. Each\nchromosome coding contains n bit strings, of which L1 to Ln-1\nrepresent the classiﬁer’s parameters, and the Ln bit string is used\nfor the input feature selection. For feature selection, the bit with\nthe value “1” in the Ln bit string represents the corresponding\nDGA feature is selected, and“0” means no selection. For the\nparameters setting of the classiﬁer, the bit strings of parameters\nwould be converted from the binary value to decimal value with a\nspeciﬁc range byEq. 1.\np /equals min\np + maxp − minp\n2l − 1 × d (1)\nHere p represents chromosome coding of parameter, min p\nrepresents minimum value of the parameter, maxp represents\nmaximum value of the parameter,d represents decimal value of\nbit string, andl represents length of bit string.\nThe individuals of the population will then be selected for\npropagation by weighing theirﬁtness values. Theﬁtness values\nmeasure the population ’s performance. The ﬁtness function\ndescribed in Eq. 2 uses the average accuracy of cross-\nvalidation for evaluation, and the higher the ﬁtness value\nrepresents a better individual.\nFIGURE 1 |The structures of the TGA and the IGA,(A) is TGA’s structure,(B) is IGA’s structure. The IGA differs from GA with two modiﬁcations: the high mutation\nrate of 0.3, and the other is the addition of elitist selection in the population selection process.\nFIGURE 2 |Structure of chromosome coding. Chromosome coding\ncontains n bit strings, of which L1 to Ln-1 represent the classiﬁer’s\nparameters, and the Ln bit string represents the DGA data used for the input\nfeature.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 7457443\nWu et al. Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis\nfitness /equals 1\nk ∑\nk\ni/equals 1\naccuracy(i) (2)\nHere, k is the fold number of the cross-validation.\nThe probability of each individual of the population being\nselected is calculated in Eq. 3 by the roulette wheel selection\nmethod.\nprobability(i)/equals fitness(i)\n∑n\ni/equals 1 fitness(i) (3)\nHere, n is the total number of individuals in each generation.\nThen in the population reproduction process, crossover and\nmutation are employed to generate a new generation by the\nselected individuals of the population with a random mechanism.\nCrossover exchanges chromosome ’s segments between two\nselected individuals stochastically, and the bit value in the\nchromosome will be converted from “0” to “1” or vice versa\noccasionally in the mutation process. New individuals are formed\nthrough crossover and mutation, which are different from the\noriginal. A new generation is created in this way. Population\nreproduction and selection processes can be repeated under the\n“survival of theﬁttest” to achieve an optimal result.\nIn the roulette wheel selection method, the greater the\nindividual’s ﬁtness is, the higher the possibility of such an\nindividual would survive, but the optimal individual of each\niteration still has a certain probability of being eliminated.\nAlso, the process of crossover and mutation may lead to the\ndisappearance of the optimal individual. Compared with TGA,\nthe optimal individual of each iteration is added directly into the\nnew generation in the IGA to avoid the disappearance of each\niteration’s optimal individual as shown inFigure 1B, which is\ncalled elitist selection. Besides, the mutation rate is set at 0.3\ninstead of the conventional low value to make the IGA jump out\nof the local optimum. These two modiﬁcations can effectively\nimprove the global search capability of the IGA and the accuracy\nof transformer fault identiﬁcation, as will be discussed in the\nSimulation Result.\n2.2.2 Performance Measures\nThe main objective of the IGA is to enhance search capability for\nthe optimization problem and gain better solutions. To analyze\nthe enhancement of search capability, the following performance\nmeasures are deﬁned (Sugihara, 1997).\n1) Average ﬁtness value f(k): the average of the value obtained\nwithin k generations in n runs.\nf(k)/equals\n∑fb(k)\nn (4)\nHere, fb(k) is the bestﬁtness values obtained withink generations;\nn is the number of independent runs.\n2) Likelihood of evolution leapLel(k): the probability of average\nleaps withink generations among n independent runs. When\na solution of one generation is better than the best solution\nobtained before the generation, the generation is said to be\na leap.\nLel(k)/equals\nl\nn (5)\nHere, l is the average number of leaps withink generations; n is\nthe number of independent runs.\n3) Likelihood of optimalityLopt(k): the probability of obtaining\noptimal solutions withink generation inn independent runs.\nFIGURE 3 |Structure of the IGA-XGBoost. The IGA is used for the\ncombined optimization of the input features and the XGBoost parameters,\nand the trained XGBoost is used to identify the fault types.\nFIGURE 4 |Structure of the transformer fault diagnosis system based on\nthe IGA-XGBoost. Transformer states are classiﬁed into six categories, and\nfour IGA-XGBoost classiﬁers are used to diagnose the fault type step by step\nin the transformer fault diagnosis system.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 7457444\nWu et al. Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis\nLopt(k)/equals m\nn (6)\nHere, m is the number of runs which produced an optimal\nsolution within k generations; n is the number of\nindependent runs.\n2.3 Transformer Fault Diagnosis System\nT h eX G B o o s ti sas c a l a b l et r e eb o o s t i n gs y s t e mt h a th a sb e e n\nsuccessfully applied in world-class machine learning and data\nmining competition because it is robust enough to avoid\noverﬁtting ( Zhang and Zhan, 2017 ). In addition, the\nXGBoost algorithm can take advantage of the original data\ndirectly without normalization. Thus, the XGBoost is utilized\nas the classiﬁer of the transformer fault diagnosis system in\nthis study. The DGA data is not fed directly into the classiﬁer\nin the proposed method. Since 18 features are collected from\nDGA methods, as shown in Table 1 , the application of\ncomplete input data is too time-consuming and could\nlower the accuracy of faults classi ﬁcation due to the\nartiﬁcial noise. Figure 3 shows the structure of the IGA-\nXGBoost. The IGA selects the input features fed to the\nXGBoost to decrease the input volume from 18 to a\nsmaller number in the IGA-XGBoost. In addition, at the\nsame time as input feature selection, the parameters of the\nX G B o o s ta r ed e c i d e db yt h eI G A .T h ep a r a m e t e r so ft h e\nXGBoost being decided by the IGA include eta,\nmax_depth, min_child_we ight, n_estimators, and\nn_gamma. The transformer fault diagnosis system\ndescribed in Figure 4 is developed based on the IGA-\nXGBoost. Transformer states are classi ﬁed into six\ncategories, which contain normal (N), partial discharge\n(PD), high-energy discharge (D1), low-energy discharge\n(D2), low and middle-temperature overheat (T1&T2), and\nhigh-temperature overheatin g (T3). The fault recognition\nproblem is decomposed and reconstructed into several\nmore minor problems that can be solved one by one. Four\nIGA-XGBoost classi ﬁers are used to detect and identify\ntransformer faults. The IGA-XGBoost1 is trained to\nseparate the normal samples from the fault samples. The\nselected fault samples by the IGA-XGBoost1 are fed to the\ntrained IGA-XGB oost2 and classiﬁed as PD, D, and T. Then,\nthe IGA-XGBoost3 and the IGA-XGBoost4 are used to\nidentify the D1, D2, T1&2, and T3.\n3 SIMULATION RESULT\nThe DGA data set employed in this study is originated from Ref\n(Kirkbas et al., 2020). The data is divided into the training data set\n(125 samples) and the test data set (25 samples). These samples\ncorrespond to six states of the transformer. For each fault state,\nthe number of samples used for the training and test process is\nshown in Table 2.\n3.1 Performance of the Proposed Method\nThe proposed method is used for transformer fault diagnosis and\ncompared with another transformer fault diagnosis system based\non the TGA and the XGBoost, which has the same structure as the\nproposed method shown in Figure 4 . The only difference\nbetween these two methods is that one uses the TGA while\nthe other uses the IGA. To ensure the validity of the selected\nfeatures and classiﬁer parameters by IGA in the training process,\nthe average accuracy of 8-fold cross-validation is taken as the\nﬁtness value. Therefore, theﬁtness curve is the average accuracy\ncurve of cross-validation. The maximum generation number was\n200. The initial population scale was set at 200, and theﬁtness of\neach iteration’s best individual was collected to form the best\nﬁtness curve shown inFigure 5. Figure 5portrays the operation\nof the proposed method in ﬁve different independent\nimplementations. Figure 6 compares the proposed method\nand the transformer fault diagnosis system based on the TGA\nand the XGBoost for the global bestﬁtness value in the training\nprocess.\nIt can be seen fromFigure 5 that the proposed method can\nachieve the same ﬁtness value for the normal or fault (N-F)\nidentiﬁcation in different independent experiments using the\nIGA-XGBoost1. The global best ﬁtness value can reach\n99.22%. When detecting PD, D, or T fault (PD-D-T), the\nIGA-XGBoost2 also can gain the same high global ﬁtness\nvalue of 99.04%. Besides, the proposed method can even 100%\ndistinguish D1 and D2 faults (D1-D2) using the IGA-XGBoost3.\nAlthough the globalﬁtness value was not as high as that of other\nfaults identiﬁcation when detecting T1&2 or T3 fault (T1&2-T3),\nmost of them reached 97.92%, with only one ﬁtness value\nreaching 95.83%. Compared with the method based on the\ntraditional GA and the XGBoost, as can be seen from\nFigure 6A, the globalﬁtness value of the method based on the\ntraditional GA and the XGBoost varies with independent\nimplementations, and its global best ﬁtness value is also\nsigniﬁcantly lower than that of the proposed method (see\nFigure 6B). For N-F identiﬁcation, the global bestﬁtness value\nof the method based on the TGA ranged from 92.8 to 98.4%. As\nfor T1&2-T3 identiﬁcation, the global bestﬁtness value of the\nmethod based on the TGA ranged from 86.5 to 98.1%. It can be\nseen from the above results that the IGA can achieve better\nsolutions.\nPerformance measures such as averageﬁtness value, likelihood of\nevolution leap, and likelihood of optimality have been taken into\nconsideration to measure the enhancement of the IGA in the\noptimization problem.Table 3shows the averageﬁtness value in\nthe 100th and 200th generations for both the TGA and the IGA.\nTable 4 shows the likelihood of evolution leap in the 100th and\nTABLE 2 |Numbers of DGA data used in the training and test process.\nTransformer states Number\nof training samples\nNumber\nof test samples\nNF 21 5\nPD 16 3\nD1 18 4\nD2 23 6\nT1&T2 23 3\nT3 24 4\nTotal data sets 125 25\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org October 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 7457445\nWu et al.

The\nabove results show that the IGA can get the optimal solution\nstably and reliably. For the test,Table 6shows the recognition\naccuracy of different methods for the test samples. The results\nin Table 6 show that the proposed method has the best\nperformance in transformer fa ult diagnosis with an average\nidenti ﬁcation accuracy of 99.2%, compared to 94.4% of the\nmethod based on the TGA and XGBoost. Combined with the\nresults of the test samples and the above results, it is shown\nthat the proposed method can effectively and reliably identify\ntransformer faults.\n3.2 Comparison With Other Methods\nIn Table 7, the performance of the proposed method is also\ncompared with other methods. The compared methods include\nDGA methods and intelligent transformer fault diagnosis methods,\nincluding IEC ratios, dual triangle, support vector machine, and\ncommon vector approach. The common vector approach has been\nrecently introduced for the transformer fault diagnosis, and the\nsupport vector machine is a commonly used algorithm for\ntransformer fault diagnosis. The result shows that the accuracy of\nDGA methods is relatively low, such as IEC ratios with an accuracy\nof 60% and the dual triangle method with an accuracy of 52%. In\ncontrast to the DGA methods, intelligent transformer fault diagnosis\nmethods based on intelligence algorithms and DGA methods have\nremarkable performance. The accuracy of the transformer fault\nidentiﬁed by the proposed method is the highest, reaching 99.2%.\nCompared to 88% for support vector machines and 96% for CVA,\nthe diagnostic accuracy of the proposed method was improved by\n11.2 and 3.6%, respectively. The result proves that the proposed\nmethod can effectively improve the accuracy of transformer fault\nidentiﬁcation.\n4 CONCLUSION\nA novel and effective transformer fault diagnosis system based on\nthe IGA-XGBoost is conducted to diagnose transformer fault\ntypes and veriﬁed in this paper. The modiﬁcations improve the\nglobal search capability of the IGA, and the IGA can get the\noptimal combined solution of input feature selection and the\nXGBoost classiﬁer optimization reliably and stably. Based on the\nIGA, the IGA-XGBoost can accurately deal with different\nrecognition problems, including N-F, PD-D-T, D1-D2, and\nT1&2-T3. Due to the excellent performance of the IGA-\nXGBoost, the average accuracy of the proposed transformer\nfault diagnosis system has been improved to 99.2%. Compared\nto IEC ratios, Dual triangle, SVM, and CVA, the simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method can be a reliable\nsolution for transformer fault diagnosis.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nPublicly available datasets were analyzed in this study.
