INTRODUCTION \nTransformers are used in the transmission and distribution systems to step up and down the voltages. \nDuring operational lifetime, transformers are exposed to failur es. These failures could be due to overloaded, \nearthquake, and mishandle during transportation. Other examples  are transformer winding deformation, \ninsulation degradation, and transformer bushings. Statistical s tudies reported by CIGRE presented that tap \nchanger has the highest percentage 56% of the transformer failures [1].  \nIn order to investigate the transformer tap changer failure, th ere are few methods such as dynamic \nresistance measurement (DRM) [2, 3]. The previous papers in usi ng DRM for tap changer diagnosis did not \nprovide an explanation on the effect of various of failures on the frequency response [2, 4]. The contact \nproblems in the DETC could be investigated using winding resist ance measurement and excitation current \nmeasurement [5, 6]. These two methods considered as a conventio n a l  t e s t .  O n  t h e  o t h e r  h a n d ,  f r e q u e n c y  \nresponse analysis (FRA ) considered as a modern method. Also, th e r e  i s  a  g e n e r a l  a g r e e m e n t  t h a t  F R A  i s  \nsensitive to the mechanical changes within the transformer [7, 8]. There are several studies in order to \ninvestigate the transformer tap changer faults using FRA. The i nfluence of tap changer on FRA is \ninvestigated. However, this study only varying the tap changer setup [9]. Also, \nS. Banaszak in [10], the paper \npresented a study on the influence of tap changer position on t he FRA.

The study also examines faulty tap changer using open circuit test only. \nThis paper investigates the effect of faulty tap changer on a t hree-phase distribution transformer \nusing FRA. The three-phase distribution transformer is located at a local power utility research center. It is \n11/0.433 kV and rated at 500kVA. There are three tap changer conditions investigated in this paper which are \nnormal, pitting and coking tap changer contact. The measurement  is conducted based on an end to end open \ncircuit, an end to end short circuit, capacitive inter-winding,  and inductive inter-winding tests. This study \nverifies the transformer winding in healthy condition using tur n ratio test and winding resistance test. The \ns i g n i f i c a n c e  o f  t h i s  s t u d y  s h o w s  t h e  c a p a b i l i t y  o f  F R A  t o  d e t e ct the faulty transformer tap changer. In \naddition, it is to improve the inspection and interpretation of the transformer failures.  \n \n \n2. FREQUENCY RESPONSE ANALYSIS \nFrequency response analysis is a well-used technique to diagnos is mechanical changes in the \ntransformer winding [12, 13]. Basically, the main function of F RA is to determine the damage on the active \nparts of the transformer (winding, leads, and core). Also, it h as been reported that FRA can detect non-\nmechanical changes such as temperature and moisture content of winding insulation. FRA is a comperhinsive \ntechnique to assess the transformer condition [14]. FRA is a co mparative test which required reference data \nto compare with. Therefore, any differences between the two mea surement response suggested there is fault \n[8, 15]. The FRA measurement is conducted by applying a small s inusoidal AC voltage signal at different \nfrequencies. This signal is injected at one end of the transfor mer winding and measured the output signal at \nthe other end of the winding as shown in Figure 1. The ratio between the measured and the injected signals is \ncalled the transfer function. The transfer function carries inf ormation regarding the capacitance, resistance, \nmutual inductance, inductance, of the winding and core. Therefo re, changes in the transformer winding and \ncore will alter its transfer function. The transfer function wi ll show these changes in the amplitude and phase \nof the measured signal [16].  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. The measurement configuration for the tested transformer [5] \n \n \nThere are four measurement connections between the transformer and FRA equipment. These are \nend to end open circuit, end to end short circuit, capacitive i nter-winding, and inductive inter-winding [15]. \nThe FRA instrument can obtain the voltage transfer function of the winding from 20 Hz to 2 MHz. This \nfrequency range is then divided into sub-bands in order to inte rpret the FRA results. These sub-bands are \ndifferent from one transformer to another. The FRA sub-bands de pend on the size of the transformer, type \nand arrangement. In literature, there are several statistical m ethods proposed to interpret the FRA \nmeasurement. For example, the correlation coefficient (CC) in [17, 18], the absolute sum of logarithmic error \n(ASLE) [19, 20]. \n \n \n3. TAP CHANGER FAULTS \nA statistical study on transformer failures was conducted in [1 ]. It indicated that tap changer fault \noccupies the highest percentage in power transformer failures. It was reported by CIGRE that 56% of power \ntransformer faults in the Netherlands were caused by tap change r. Hence, the study of fault on power \ntransformer tap changer is a major concern in recent years [21] . There are three OLTCs contact degradation \nstages accrued. These are film on the contact surface, high loc al temperature (coking) on the contact surface \nand finally contact failure due to overheating (pitted spots or  pitting). Other failures can occur such as \n\n      ISSN: 2088-8694 \nInt J Pow Elec & Dri Syst Vol. 11, No. 1, Mar 2020 : 350 – 358 \n352\nchemical or mechanical wear, for instance, oxidation, coking, m echanical wear, fretting and thermal \ndeformations (pitting) [22]. \n \n3.1. Coking \nCoking is a chemical process when carbon is extracted from the surrounding oil of power \ntransformer and attached on the tap changer contact. The proces s started with thin oil film formation on the \ncontact. Subsequently, it leads to increasing of tap contact re sistance. Therefore, it produces more heat. \nMoreover, this phenomenon activates when temperature close to 2 00 °C above. Then, the surrounding oil \nwill form coking on tap changer contact [22]. Based on the prev ious study in literature coking influence the \ncontact resistance and higher its temperature [11, 23]. \n \n3.2. Pitting \nPitting corrosion is localized small cavities or holes formed i n metals such as copper. Typically, \npitting accrued in the advanced stages of aging and on the chan ge over selector contacts [4]. Besides of the \nincrease of carbon, small pitted spots are created which can be developed into deep holes. \n \n \n4. METHODOLOGY \n4.1. Transformer configuration \nThis experimental study is conducted on a three-phase distribut ion transformer with de-energized \ntap changer (DETC) rated at 11/0.433 kV, 500 kVA as shown in Fi gure 2(a). The transformer vector group \nand configuration also are shown in Figure 2(b). The winding ta ps are connected to the tap changer selector \nas shown in Figure 2(c). Tap changer setting is provided in Tab le 1. It briefly explains the tap changer \nnumbers and the taps winding connected. For example, Tap1 conne cts tap number 4 and 5 thus, selecting the \nwhole winding while Tap5 connects tap number 2 and 7 which only  selects the minimum amount of turn in \nthe winding. However, in this transformer, the taps numbers are  not marked in the tap changer selector. This \nis because the transformer has been un-tanked before and the ta p leads have been removed. For this reason, \nturns ratio test need to be performed to identify the taps numbers. \n \n \n  \n(a) (b) (c) \n \nFigure 2. (a) Experimented 500kVA distribution transformer (b) transformer winding configuration (c) tap \nchanger selector DETC position control \n \n \n4.2. Transformer turn ratio measurement \nTurn ratio test is conducted for all transformer taps. It is to  i n d i c a t e  t h e  V r a t i o  f o r  a l l  t a p s .  T h i s  \nmeasurement will help to identify the taps numbers which are no t marked in the tap changer selector. It is \nalso to validate the condition of all three phases winding. Thi s is by comparing the measured and calculated \nVratio. It has a simple connection where the input signal injec ted at HV terminal and the output signal \nmeasured at the LV side. The turn ratio test was conducted usin g TRF-100 which is manufactured by \nVanguard Instrument. To calculate the turn ratio from the transformer nameplate: \n \nHV phaseV ratio LV phase\n  ( 1 )  \n\nInt J Pow Elec & Dri Syst ISSN: 2088-8694  \n \nFrequency response analysis for transformer tap changer damage detection (S. Al-Ameri) \n353\nIn a delta connection, Vline = Vphase, however, to get Vline in star connection Vline = Vphase ×√3. The \nTRF-100 also calculate the percentage difference (Δ%) between the calculated and measured voltage ratio. \n \n \n4.3. Tap changer faults fabrication \nCopper tape is used to investigate the effect of faulty tap cha nger on FRA measurement. The most \ncommon tap changer failures are coking and pitting. To perform coking, charcoal dust has been glued on a \npiece of copper tape. Basically, the glue applied on the copper  surface did not affect the contact because it \nhas been dried before using. On the other hand, to form pitting  corrosion on the copper tape, hammer and \nchisel were used. The normal, coking and pitting copper tape ar e shown in Figure 3. The copper tapes are \nused to connect two taps in DETC by holding using G-clamp as shown in  \nFigure 2(c). \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. The fabricated copper tapes. From left, normal, pitting and coking. \n \n \n4.4. FRA measurement connection \nAccording to CIGRE WG A2.26 [15] , IEEE C57.146 standard [8] and  IEC 60076-18 [24] there are \nfour measurement configurations between the transformer and FRA  equipment. They are end to end open \ncircuit, end to end short circuit, capacitive inter-winding, an d inductive inter-winding. In the end to end open \ncircuit, the signal is injected at one end of the winding and m easure the output signal at another end of the \nsame winding while the low voltage winding is open. The end to end short circuit measurement is similar to \nend to end open circuit but the low voltage winding terminals a re shorted. The capacitive inter-winding \nconnection is conducted by applying the input signal at the hig h voltage side and measure the output voltage \nat the low voltage side. The inductive inter-winding connection  is quite similar to capacitive inter-winding, \nbut the high voltage and low voltage windings are grounded. \n \n4.5. Winding resistance measurement \nThe winding resistance measurement is conducted to determine th e winding resistance value. It is \nbelieved that coking in tap changer increases the total winding  resistance. Hence, the winding resistance \nmeasurement is performed. This measurement could support the FR A measurement. The winding resistance \nmeter is a digital resistance reading from 1 micro-ohm to 500 o hms [25]. Winding resistance measurement is \nconducted at HV side of one phase. \n \n \n5. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS \nIt was mentioned earlier that transformer turn ratio measuremen t is conducted to determine the taps \npositions. There are five taps in the HV winding but they are n ot marked. Transformer turn ratio was \nperformed to validate if the voltage ratio of all phases is in good condition. Table 1 shows the calculated \nvoltage ratio. From the results of voltage ratio and current va lues, we can determine the actual configuration \nof the transformer winding and tap changer position. The actual  arrangement is shown in Figure 4(a) and \nFigure 4(b). Hence the new arrangement can be summarised in Tab le 1. Further investigation on the \ncondition of all phase’s voltage ratio is performed using (2). Here TRC and TRM are the calculated and the \nmeasured turn ratio respectively. The deviation in voltage rati o and action is proposed by local power utility \nand given in Table 2. The calculation identifies that all phases are in good condition and the results are shown \nin Table 3. \n\n      ISSN: 2088-8694 \nInt J Pow Elec & Dri Syst Vol. 11, No. 1, Mar 2020 : 350 – 358 \n354\n \n(a) (b) \n \nFigure 4.

Frequency response analysis results \nThe FRA test were performed on all three phases of the transformer. However, only results from RY \nphase is presented. This is because the other phases have simil ar result. Initially, the copper tapes are held on \nthe tap changer using the G-clamp at very tight connection. The  response is presented in Figure 5(a). It can \nbe observed that there is a small variation at low frequency re gion at about 100Hz. It is also shown that there \nis a minor shifting towards higher frequencies as shown in Figu re 5 inset. On the other hand, the frequency \nresponse for normal, pitting, and coking when the G-clamp is no t very tight is shown in Figure 5(b). This is \nquite possible in real case where the springs to push taps in p lace has weaken. In the response, it can be \nobserved that the negative slope from coking has a huge variati on at low-frequency region at about 20Hz to \n2kHz. This is where the influence of inductive element is observable. It could also be due to increasing of tap \nchanger resistance. However, it could be seen a small variation between normal and pitting at about 100Hz. \n\nInt J Pow Elec & Dri Syst ISSN: 2088-8694  \n \nFrequency response analysis for transformer tap changer damage detection (S.

The response shows that p itting does not give any effect compare to the \nresponse of normal tap changer. However, frequency response due  to coking shows a huge variation at low-\nfrequency region. Similar to end to end open and short circuit results, the inductive inter-winding test shows \nthe variation due to coking of tap changer occurs at low-freque ncy region. The inductive inter-winding \nresponse is shown in Figure 6(b). Finally, the capacitive inter -winding test is unable to detect the tap changer \nfaults. The frequency responses of normal, pitting, and coking at capacitive inter-winding measurement \nconfiguration is presented in Figure 6(c). No visible variation or changes between three responses. \n \n \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \n \n \n \n(c) \n \nFigure 6.

Winding resistance results \nThe winding resistance test has been conducted using transforme r resistance meter model WRM-40 \nmanufactured by Vanguard Instruments Co. The winding resistance  measurement is presented in Table 4. In \nthe normal tap changer, the maximum winding resistance is at ph ase R which is about 1.556 ohms. While the \nwinding resistance of the tap changer due to pitting increased about 0.01 ohm on all phases. However, the \nwinding resistance increases at much higher value when the tap changer experience fault due to coking. The \n\n      ISSN: 2088-8694 \nInt J Pow Elec & Dri Syst Vol. 11, No. 1, Mar 2020 : 350 – 358 \n356\nwinding resistance at phase R shows 9.282 ohms which is a huge value compare with normal at 1.556 ohms. \nAdditionally, the cooking tap changer contact was damaged durin g the experiment. The damage was \noccurred during taking the measurement in phase B. For this rea son, the resistance of phase B is 3.566 ohms \nwhich is now smaller than resistance of phases R and Y. To investigate the condition of transformer winding, \nthe percentage difference of winding resistance between phases can be calculated using (3). Here a and b are \nthe phases in transformer. The suggested actions based on the r esistance are provided by local power utility \nas given in Table 5. The measured resistances are presented in Table 6. The results suggest that all phases are \nin good condition at normal and pitting tap changer but in a bad condition when the tap changer has coking. \n \n \nTable 4.

CONCLUSION \nFRA test is a recognized method to detect the transformer windi ng faults. In this paper, the FRA is \nused to investigate normal and faulty transformer tap changer. Three tap changer conditions were formed and \nobserve the winding frequency response of four test configurati ons. This gives a clear understanding of the \ncapability of using FRA to detect the transformer tap changer f aults. The results show that end to end open \ncircuit, end to end short circuit, inductive inter-winding test s are sensitive to tap changer coking at the \nnegative slope in the low-frequency region. On the other hand, pitting on tap contact has a small effect on the \nFRA at all frequency region. The turn ratio measurement is to i dentify the taps positions. It also verifies that \nthe all phases V ratio are in good condition. In addition, the winding resistance mea surement is conducted to \nvalidate the FRA findings. It is founded that, pitting in the t ransformer tap contact slightly increase the \nwinding resistance. However, coking on tap changer contact has more effect on the winding resistance than \npitting. The winding resistance increases from 1.556 ohms at no rmal tap changer to 9.252 ohms due to \ncoking on tap changer contact. Eventually, the FRA is a sensiti ve tool can be utilized to detect tap changer \ncoking and pitting. Further study is recommended to investigate  o t h e r  e x p e c t e d  t r a n s f o r m e r  t a p  c h a n g e r  \nfaults using FRA. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors would like to thank the TNB Research for the provis ion of test facilities and great \nsupport for the experimental tests.
