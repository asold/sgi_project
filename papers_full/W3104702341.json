INTRODUCTION\nPower transformers are some of the most critical and expen-\nsive pieces of equipment in electric power systems. The\nfailure of power transformers inevitably has a serious negative\nimpact on the power supply and may result in massive power\nblackouts and high maintenance costs. Hence, maintaining\nthe reliability of power transformers is the most important\ntask in an electric power system. Suitable methods for power\ntransformer fault detection can considerably reduce the main-\ntenance fees of power transformers and hence ensure stable\nand reliable energy delivery.\nAmong the available transformers, oil-immersed power\ntransformers play important roles in voltage and current con-\nversion in modern electric power systems. An oil-immersed\npower transformer contains a large amount of insulating oil.\nThe goal of the insulating oil is to reduce the temperature\nand increase the efﬁciency of energy production. The purpose\nof the insulating oil is to isolate the insulating material from\nthe body, suppress corona or arc, and serve as a coolant.\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Lei Shu\n .\nInsulating oil can effectively cool the temperature rise gen-\nerated during the conversion of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the\npower transformer. In other words, the insulating oil is used\nto block the insulation between the conductor and the shell\nand, by discharging the heat generated by the internal wires\nduring operation through the operation of the cooling system,\nto reduce the temperature and improve the power supply\ncapacity and efﬁciency. In addition to the cooling it provides\nthrough the process of the cooling power system, the insu-\nlating oil also provides some electrical insulation between\nthe internal live parts to maintain long-term stability under\nthe high temperature. Moreover, it is necessary to regularly\nsample and analyze the oil quality to determine whether the\noil has latent defects for effective treatment.\nTherefore, when sampled and analyzed oil quality data are\nmisjudged due to negligence or improper analysis, the delay\nin processing may result in power transformer loss due to\npower failure. As a result, the diagnosis of insulating oil in\npower transformers is a very important task in electric power\nsystems.\nThe insulating oil in power transformers will dissolve\nnine kinds of gases if the content of any combustible gas is\n209570 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Linet al.: Methodology for Diagnosing Faults in Oil-Immersed Power Transformers Based\ngreater than the standard value (ANSI/IEEE C57.104). For\nsafe operation, the power transformer must be shut down for\nmaintenance or repair.\nAdditionally, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a popular\ntechnique for detecting incipient faults in power transformers\nthat use oil, and some standards have been designed for\nDGA interpretation, such as IEEE C57.104-1991 [1] and\nIEC 60599.\nPresently, the insulating oil in oil-immersed power trans-\nformers in the power supply operation of the Taiwan Power\nCompany, Taiwan, follows the standard procedures in the\nmaintenance manuals of substation equipment.\nThe detection results show that the gas content of hydrogen\n(H2), methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), ethylene (C2H4), acety-\nlene (C2H2), and carbon monoxide (CO) exceeds the standard\nvalue and needs to be included in tracking or performing\ninspections and maintenance to identify the cause of failure.\nIn a real case that occurred on August 13, 2012, the insu-\nlating oil in the no. 4 autotransformer (#4 ATr) of the Nanke\nextra-high-voltage substation (E/S) of the Taiwan Power\nCompany, Taiwan, was sampled by the standard procedure\nand submitted for inspection. The inspection report of the\nTaiwan Power Comprehensive Research Institute showed that\nthe gas content was compared.\nThe data had increased signiﬁcantly compared with the\nprevious data, especially for the content of methane, ethylene,\nand acetylene, which increased from 246 ppm, 276 ppm,\nand 0 ppm to 387 ppm, 496 ppm, and 0.8 ppm, respectively.\nThe total combustible gas (TCG) increased from 808 ppm to\n1,199 ppm; this abnormal increase might endanger the regular\noperation of oil-immersed power transformers.\nBased on the premise of a stable power supply and equip-\nment safety, the authorities and maintenance department of\nthe Taiwan Power Company, Taiwan, convened relevant tech-\nnical units and manufacturers to investigate, discuss, and con-\ncurrently conduct partial discharge detection for the abnormal\ngas content in the insulating oil to identify the cause and seek\nimprovement methods.\nThe ﬁnal decision was to shut down on October 25th,\n2012, for internal inspection of the transformer body. It was\nfound that one of the four screws of the S-phase on-load tap\nchanger (OLTC) selection switch leading to the no-load tap\nand position tap 6 (NTAP T6) contact terminal board had\nmelted and a large amount of copper rust slag had adhered\nto the surrounding surface.\nThe gas analysis process is performed to analyze and\ninspect the insulating oil. It is necessary to refer to the spec-\niﬁcation guidelines of oil-immersed power transformer fault\ndiagnosis and the manufacturer’s literature information. If we\nwant to be more productive and accurate, we can decompose\nthe content of each gas in the oil and follow the various\nstandard test methods or graphs that are used as the basis for\ninterpretation and comparison.\nHowever, most of them are still drawn manually based on\nthe judgment and experience of each technician and may be\naffected by human error or a lack of experience, which will\ncause misunderstanding and increase the number of power\noutages and substantial maintenance costs.\nTherefore, it is necessary to rely on high-quality\ntechnologies and experience to diagnose oil-immersed power\ntransformers. For this purpose, an innovative diagnostic\nmethodology is developed from a large amount of data, cor-\nrelation coefﬁcient theory and classical detection/estimation\ntheory in this article. Big data are used to establish two sets of\nprobability density functions (PDFs) from the experimental\ndata sets. The diagnostic methodology for the minimiza-\ntion of the maintenance cost is based on classical detec-\ntion/estimation theory, and minimizing the cost is regarded\nas the criterion of diagnosis.\nThe remainder of this article is organized as follows.\nRelated works are reviewed and introduced in Section II.\nThe proposed methodology is introduced in Section III. The\nexperimental design and a performance evaluation of the\nproposed methodology are described in Section IV. Finally,\nwe conclude this work in Section V.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nGenerally, the insulation system of an oil-immersed power\ntransformer consists of insulation oil and solid insulation\n(such as paper, insulation board, or rubber). Hence, based on\ncertain measurements and analyses of the oil, many diagnos-\ntic techniques for power transformers have been proposed in\nthe literature [2]–[6]. Morais and Rolim [2] developed and\napplied oil power transformers and performed gas analysis.\nThrough integrated calculations of the standard speciﬁca-\ntions of the content of each gas in the oil by an artiﬁcial neural\nnetwork (ANN) and fuzzy logic system, the system stability\nand reliability were assessed, with reliability and accuracy\nvalues greater than 80%.\nMalik et al. [3] used artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) to compile\ndiagnostic technology, and a fuzzy logic method was adopted\nto diagnose multiple fault conditions for the same power\ntransformer. This work was shown to yield substantial results.\nRozga et al. [4] proposed a multilevel detection procedure\nto ensure the accuracy of abnormality detection for power\ntransformers.\nSarkar et al. [5] designed an optimized model based on tra-\nditional and new technologies as well as expert experience to\ntest the insulation of power transformer equipment, especially\nthe moisture content of insulating paper. IEEE Std. 62-1995\n(R2005) [6] was used as a guide to assess the pros and cons of\ndifferent decomposed gas levels in oil, and these levels were\ndivided into four stages, namely, normal, attention required,\nabnormal, and dangerous, for the reference of maintenance\npersonnel for power system equipment.\nThe Rogers ratio, Doernenburg ratio, Duval triangle\n[7]–[10], and linear support vector machine (SVM)-based\nmethodologies [11], [12] are well-known conventional fault\nrecognition methodologies for power transformers.\nPiotrowaki et al. [7] analyzed the excess hydrogen in the\ngas content of oil; it was conﬁrmed by the IEC 60599 ratio\nmethodology and the Duval triangle methodology that a\nVOLUME 8, 2020 209571\nM.-J. Linet al.: Methodology for Diagnosing Faults in Oil-Immersed Power Transformers Based\npartial discharge phenomenon occurred in the power trans-\nformer, but the case described in CIGRE manual 2965 may\nbe caused by the incompatibility between the material and\nthe oil.\nMansour [8] noted that the Duval triangle methodology\ncannot be used to effectively diagnose low overheating and\ncorona discharge. Therefore, a pentagonal diagnosis method-\nology was developed by incorporating the content of ethane\nand hydrogen gas. Compared with those of the diagnostic\nmethodology of the ratio method, the results of a fault case\nindicated that the proposed diagnosis method was more\naccurate.\nSumari and Ahmad [9] proposed a smart knowledge\ngrowth system in which future phenomena are predicted\nfrom real-life data for decision makers. An advantage of this\nsystem is that it encompasses the new idea mechanisms of\nAI established by human thinking and receives information\nfrom various sensors as inputs to improve the accuracy of the\noutput.\nLi et al. [10] adopted the proportion of each gas concen-\ntration in oil and an SVM; the initial fault diagnosis method\nused a genetic algorithm for a power transformer. Kecman\nand Melki [11] used MATLAB software to implement a linear\nSVM and an optimization algorithm from an SVM solver; this\napproach was effective for large and very large data sets.\nKhan et al. [12] applied a fuzzy logic and adaptive neural\nfuzzy inference system to analyze the internal initial faults\nof power transformers for oil-in-gas analysis. This method is\nstable and highly accurate and can overcome the limitations\nof traditional diagnostic methods such as the IEC 60599\nstandard, Rogers ratio, and Doernenburg ratio methods.\nIn these diagnostic methodologies, the key gas ratios are\nﬁrst computed and then mapped to predeﬁned fault patterns.\nThe above traditional DGA ratio schemes have been widely\nused for power transformer diagnosis. However, some limi-\ntations exist in these methods; for example, an interpretation\nfor every possible combination of ratios may not be provided.\nTherefore, several more sophisticated power transformer\nfault diagnosis technologies have been developed to improve\nthe diagnostic capability using SVM, fuzzy neural network\n(NN) [13], AI [14], [15] and related machine learning-based\nmethods [16].\nMiranda et al. [13] developed a set of autoassociated NN\nautoencoders to identify faulty and nonfaulty conditions. This\nmethod uses two sets of parallel models. When the vector\ndata are input, the autoencoders compete with each other and\nuse the latest recognition result as the diagnostic result. This\nmethod has been veriﬁed with actual data to achieve high\naccuracy.\nChamandoust et al. [14] adopted a dual optimization\nmethod for the development and design of a hybrid system,\nwith the goals of optimizing the net cost and operating cost.\nMoreover, this method incorporated many considerations,\nsuch as wind turbine, solar cell, and fuel cell characteristics.\nGill and Sharma [15] developed a gesture recognition\nmethod in human-computer interaction free mode, and the\nmethod involved four algorithms: image number, spike value,\nobject counting, and template matching. This method dis-\nplayed high robustness and yielded effective results in a\ncluttered and noisy background.\nPuth et al. [17] adopted a GARCH-Copula sequence\ncomparison-based algorithm to develop a novel four-stage\nalgorithm to measure the correlation coefﬁcient for the rank-\nings of ﬁnancial time series. The proposed method was veri-\nﬁed by practical data, and its advantages over other methods\nwere illustrated.\nIn general, these newly developed fault diagnosis\ntechnologies for power transformers have improved fault\nidentiﬁcation accuracy. Most of the above conventional and\nadvanced fault diagnosis methods for power transformers aim\nto categorize the fault type and increase the diagnostic accu-\nracy. However, these developed diagnostic methods are not\ndirectly linked to the maintenance cost as a design criterion.\nOther recent related works include [21]–[32].\nNotably, modern deep learning techniques are used in\npower transformer difﬁdent protection [31] and fault diag-\nnosis [32]. Machine learning-based techniques (such as deep\nlearning techniques) require massive amounts of data (pat-\nterns) for training data sets and test data sets to increase the\naccuracy of faults diagnosis. If real historic oil-immersed\npower transformer fault data can be obtained, deep learn-\ning technology may be applied to the proposed problem.\nHowever, fault data are very limited in real situations.\nThrough correlation analyses among the content patterns\nof gases dissolved in power transformer oil when the power\ntransformer is operating in normal and abnormal conditions,\nwe consider the correlation a random variable and then\nmodel the power transformer diagnosis problem as a hypoth-\nesis testing problem [20]. Based on conventional estimation\ntheory and detection theory, a novel detection method for\noil-immersed power transformer faults is developed in this\narticle by minimizing the power transformer maintenance\ncost. In theory, maintenance cost minimization is an optimal\nsolution.\nTherefore, the incipient failure detection problem for\noil-immersed power transformers is investigated in this\narticle, and a novel diagnosis methodology for minimiz-\ning the maintenance cost of an oil-immersed power trans-\nformer is proposed. Compared to previous work, this is the\nﬁrst work to consider the optimization of the maintenance\ncost.\nMoreover, the proposed diagnostic methodology is applied\nin a test case of 950 sets of real historic record data provided\nby Taiwan Power Company, Taiwan. The proposed diagnostic\nmethodology is introduced in detail in the next section.\nIII. THE PROPOSED DIAGNOSTIC METHODOLOGY\nA. PRELIMINARY INFORMATION\nAs mentioned earlier, based on the information associated\nwith the gases dissolved in power transformer oil, many\nincipient fault detection methods for power transformers have\nbeen developed in the literature.\n209572 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM.-J. Linet al.: Methodology for Diagnosing Faults in Oil-Immersed Power Transformers Based\nTABLE 1. Correlation computation example.\nBased on this approach, we note that the content patterns\nof dissolved gases (DGs), e.g., H 2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6\nand CO, in power transformers operating under normal and\nabnormal conditions are different. Intuitively, the correlation\nbetween two measured DG contents in normal and abnormal\nworking conditions will be relatively low.\nHowever, two measured DG contents in normal working\nconditions should be highly correlated. This correlation\nmay play a crucial role in determining whether a power\ntransformer is operating in normal or abnormal conditions.\nHence, our idea is ﬁrst to identify the typical DG con-\ntent pattern from collecting DG measurements from a power\ntransformer working in a normal state.\nThen, the correlation between the tested DG in the power\ntransformer and the typical DG pattern is considered as a\nrandom variable r, and two hypotheses can be deﬁned. One is\nhypothesis H1, which represents the tested power transformer\nbeing in a good working condition.\nThe other is hypothesis H0, which represents the power\ntransformer experiencing incipient failure. Thus, the power\ntransformer diagnosis problem can be modeled as a hypoth-\nesis testing problem [20]. The optimal decision rule is devel-\noped by minimizing the power transformer maintenance cost\nas follows.\nB. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS\nHere, let x and y be the two data sets of the six DGs (including\nH2, CH 4, C 2H4, C 2H2, C 2H6 and CO). These gases were\nextracted from power transformer insulation oil under abnor-\nmal and normal conditions. Please note that x is the abnormal\ngroup (condition) and y is the normal group (condition).\nThe correlation of x and y is computed based on Pearson’s\ncorrelation coefﬁcient (PCC) (1), also referred to as Pearson’s\nr [17], where n is the sample size and xi and yi are the individ-\nual sample points indexed with i. The result can be considered\na variable that reﬂects the similarity of the corresponding data\npatterns between the two data sets [18], [19].\nr = n ∑xiyi −∑xi\n∑yi√\nn ∑x2\ni −\n(∑xi\n)2\n√\nn ∑y2\ni −\n(∑yi\n)2\n(1)\nWithout loss of generality, n is the number of gas types and\nis set to 6 in this article, and the index i ranges from 1 to n.\nOne example of the computation is shown in Table 1.\nThis formulation will yield a value in the range of −1\n≤r ≤1. Since we want to use the correlation r to determine\nwhether a power transformer is working normally, we have\nto know the conditional PDFs of the correlation r under\nhypotheses H1 and H0, namely, p(r|H1) and p(r|H0).\nHowever, we do not theoretically know the conditional\nPDFs. Fortunately, based on the empirical data, we can obtain\nestimated conditional PDFs, denoted as ˆp(r|H1) and ˆp(r|H0).\nIn this article, we create the estimated PDFs of the correlation\nr from the empirical data. The empirical distributions are used\nfor hypothesis testing [20] to assess the performance of the\nproposed scheme.\nC. THE POWER TRANSFORMER DIAGNOSIS MODEL\nThe power transformer fault diagnosis problem is treated as a\nbinary hypothesis testing problem. Hence, when we conduct\na hypothesis test, there are a couple of things that could go\nwrong.\nThere are two kinds of errors, namely, type-I and type-II\nerrors, which cannot be avoided by design. A type-I error\ninvolves falsely inferring the existence of something that is\nnot present, and a type-II error involves falsely inferring the\nabsence of something that is present. These errors may affect\nthe power transformer maintenance cost. Here, we adopt clas-\nsical detection and estimation theory [20] to express the possi-\nble maintenance cost in terms of the conditional probabilities\nand the corresponding decision regions as follows :\nC =P (H1)C11\n∫\nz1\nˆp (r |H1)dr\n+P (H1)C01\n∫\nz0\nˆp (r |H1)dr\n+P (H0)C10\n∫\nz1\nˆp (r |H0)dr\n+P (H0)C00\n∫\nz0\nˆp (r |H0)dr (2)\nwhere P (H1) and P (H0) are the probability values in the\nprevious period and represent that the power transformer\nis operating under normal or abnormal conditions, respec-\ntively; C11,C01,C10 and C00 are the costs of the four deci-\nsions, where the ﬁrst subscript indicates the hypothesis cho-\nsen and the second subscript indicates the true hypothesis.\nAdditionally, z1 and z0 are the decision regions corresponding\nto the chosen hypotheses H1 and H0, respectively.\nIt is reasonable to assume that the cost of a wrong decision\nis higher than the cost of a correct decision. In a Bayes test\n[20], we can ﬁnd the decision regions z1 and z0 such that the\ncost is minimized. Therefore, we can obtain the following\nalternative expression, which is the well-known likelihood\nratio test [20]:\nˆP (r |H1)\nˆP (r |H0)\nH1\n≷\nH0\nP (H0)(C10 −C00)\nP (H1)(C01 −C11) (3)\nBy employing the above likelihood ratio test, a detection\nmethod for oil-immersed power transformer faults can be\ndesigned based on the empirical data of the target power\ntransformer. The usage of the proposed methodology is illus-\ntrated by the following experimental design based on real data\ncollected from Taiwan Power Company, Taiwan.\nIV.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nBased on the 1,000 normal and 100 normal DG data sets\ncollected, by using (9), we obtained 1, 000 ×100 =100,000\ndata samples of r for the power transformer in a normal status.\nSimilarly, based on the 1,000 normal and 100 abnormal DG\ndata sets collected, we obtained 1, 000 ×100 =100,000\ndata samples of r for the power transformer under incipient\nfailure.\nThe probability histograms of the correction r for these two\ncases are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. Based on the probability\nhistograms, the correlation between the two measured DG\nFIGURE 3. The estimated probability density function for the normal\nstatus group.\ncontent patterns under normal and abnormal working condi-\ntions is low. However, the correlation between the two mea-\nsured DG content patterns under normal working conditions\nis high with high probability. This result is consistent with our\nintuition.\nBased on the empirical data, the estimated conditional\nPDFs of r, denoted ˆp(r|H1) and ˆp(r|H0), are obtained, and the\ncorresponding expressions are given in (4) and (5) by using\na PDF estimation method. In other words, formulas (4) and\n(5) are derived from Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, which show\nthe experimental results of the empirical data compiled and\nestimated by the MATLAB software tool.

Statisti-\ncally, the larger the number is, the better the result, but values\nmay be limited by the computing power of the system used\nto run the algorithm and the available data sets.\nr\nH1\n≷\nH0\nη (6)\nB. VALIDITY VERIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE\nWe employed a chromatography instrument (ASTM D3612)\nto collect another 950 sets of data for a power transformer\nwith insulating oil; data from the target power transformer\nof Taiwan Power Company were used as the benchmark for\ntesting. The benchmark data consisted of 900 sets of values\nobtained under normal conditions and 50 sets obtained under\nabnormal conditions.\nThe novel detection method proposed in this paper for oil-\nimmersed power transformer faults was developed based on\nminimizing the power transformer maintenance cost. Based\non the abovementioned estimation theory and detection the-\nory, minimization of the maintenance cost can be ensured if\nthe proposed scheme is adopted. Therefore, for comparison,\nthe probability of obtaining a detection error can be computed\nwith the proposed method.\nIn statistical hypothesis testing [20], a type-I error is the\nrejection of a true null hypothesis H0, and a type-II error\nfails to reject a false null hypothesis. Here, the diagnostic\nrule presented in (6) is used, and the probabilities of these\ntwo types of detection errors are expressed as shown in (7)\nand (8), respectively. The probability of obtaining a detection\nerror can therefore be obtained as shown in (9).\nPm =\n∫\nz1\nˆp (r |H0)dr (7)\nPf =\n∫\nz0\nˆp (r |H1)dr (8)\nPe =P (H1)\n∫\nz0\nˆp (r |H1)dr +P (H0)\n∫\nz1\nˆp (r |H0)dr (9)\nTo assess the performance of our fault detection method\nfor oil-immersed power transformers, we ﬁrst used the data\npresented in Section III to estimate the conditional PDFs\nˆp(r|H1) and ˆp(r|H0), as shown in Fig. 5. Additionally, we set\nthe values of the parameters shown in Table 2 based on\nexperience to determine a threshold ηof 0.46, and the mini-\nmized maintenance cost was 0.6141 C01, as shown in Fig. 7.\nNote that the experience values are not given here for business\nconﬁdentiality reasons.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 209575\nM.-J. Linet al.: Methodology for Diagnosing Faults in Oil-Immersed Power Transformers Based\nTABLE 3. Comparison of related works and the proposed methodology.\nFIGURE 7. Minimized maintenance cost atr = 0.46.\nFurthermore, using the proposed power transformer fault\ndetection procedure shown in Fig. 6, the resulting detection\nerror was 7.15%. Through the benchmark test, we found\nthat the developed diagnostic method also has a satisfactory\ndetection accuracy with a low complexity of implementation,\ncomparable to those of some related works, as summarized\nin Table 3. Note that the proposed method can only detect\nif the transformer is going to have a fault, but it cannot carry\nout the classiﬁcation of the transformer’s faults. Nevertheless,\nour scheme will be very suitable for online diagnostic tools\nbecause it is easy to implement in a monitoring system.\nThis scheme can also be used as the ﬁrst stage to detect if\nthe transformer is going to have a fault; then, the existing\ntransformer’s fault classiﬁcation methods can be employed to\ndetermine what types of faults to expect, or the transformer\ncan be shut down for manual inspection.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a detection method for oil-immersed power\ntransformer faults is developed by minimizing the mainte-\nnance cost. The novelty of this method is that it considers the\nmaintenance cost as a design criterion instead of the detection\nerror. This approach is believed to be directly linked to a\ncompany’s operating cost because it guarantees a minimized\nmaintenance cost. Because the maintenance cost is highly\nrelated to the detection error, the performance of the proposed\nmethod can also be veriﬁed by the detection accuracy.\nThe proposed methodology was applied in a benchmark\ntest of 950 sets of historical data, and the results showed that\nthe failure detection accuracy was 92.85% with minimized\nmaintenance costs. The experimental results indicated that\nthe proposed methodology displayed promising performance\nand can be used as a tool for the diagnosis of incipient faults\nin power transformers.\nAdditionally, the proposed detection procedure is very\nstraightforward and can be implemented with soft-\nware or hardware. Therefore, this method is very suit-\nable for real-time online fault detection for oil-immersed\npower transformers. Moreover, the proposed scheme can\nalso be used as the ﬁrst stage to detect if an oil-immersed\n209576 VOLUME 8, 2020\nM.-J.

In conclusion, the proposed methodology\nprovides insight into the ability to minimize maintenance\ncosts in the diagnosis of oil-immersed power transform-\ners, thus improving the accuracy of detection and reducing\nmaintenance costs.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank Taiwan Power Company,\nTaiwan, for providing 950 real historical records for this\nwork.\nREFERENCES\n[1] IEEE Guide for the Interpretation of Gases Generated in Oil-Immersed\nTransformers–Redline, IEEE Standard C57.104-1991, Feb. 2009.\n[2] D.
