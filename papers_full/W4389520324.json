This\nstudy contributes to the understanding of how\nLLMs perceive and represent social groups,\nshedding light on their potential biases and the\nperpetuation of harmful associations.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), trained on vast\namounts of web-crawled data, have been found to\nencode and perpetuate harmful associations preva-\nlent in the training data. For instance, previous\nresearch has demonstrated that LLMs 1 exhibit as-\nsociations between Muslims and violence, as well\nas between specific gender pronouns (e.g. she)\nand stereotypical occupations (e.g. homemaker)\n(Abid et al., 2021; Bolukbasi et al., 2016). To\naddress these concerns, various measurement tech-\nniques and mitigation strategies have been devel-\noped (Nadeem et al., 2021; Nangia et al., 2020;\nSchick et al., 2021). For example, benchmark\ndatasets have been proposed to capture stereotyp-\ning in LLMs by presenting two contrastive pairs\n(e.g. (the poor, the rich), (Whites, Asians)) based\non various sociodemographic and cultural dimen-\nsions (e.g. race, gender, ethnicity), allowing for a\ncomparison of the likelihood of these associations\nin LLM outputs (Nadeem et al., 2021; Nangia et al.,\n2020).\nDespite the utility of benchmark datasets for captur-\ning biased stereotyping in LLMs, there have been\nvalid critiques regarding construct validity (what\nthe test is measuring) and the operationalization\nof the construct (how well the test is measuring it)\n(Blodgett et al., 2021). These benchmark datasets\noften rely on crowd-sourced or crowd-worked data\nitself without a strong theoretical foundation to\nsupport the underlying assumptions. While such\ndata can provide valuable insights, we argue that\nincorporating established and validated theories\nfrom psychology can enhance the measurement\nof stereotypes in LLMs by providing a theoretical\nframework to identify the dimensions that consti-\ntute stereotypes and based on that develop robust\nmetrics and methods for measuring and interpreting\nstereotypes (Cao et al., 2022; Fraser et al., 2021).\nTo work towards this goal, we propose a frame-\nwork that we call\n STEREO MAP, which serves\nas a comprehensive testbed for measuring stereo-\ntypes in LLMs. This framework is grounded in the\n1Throughout the paper, we use the term Large Language\nModels (LLMs) and Language Models (LMs) interchangeably,\nboth referring to language models.\n12236\nwidely adopted Stereotype Content Model (SCM)\nput forth by Fiske et al. (2002). To be specific,\nthe SCM posits that individuals and groups are\nperceived based on two fundamental dimensions:\nWARMTH and COMPETENCE . In contrast to the\nnotion of stereotypes being uniform hostility, the\nSCM plots stereotypes in a two-dimensional vec-\ntor space between warmth and competence that\ncontribute to stereotypes.\nThe proposed framework aims to analyze the per-\nceptions of how social groups are viewed in society\nby Language Models (LLMs) through the dimen-\nsions of Warmth and Competence, while also con-\nsidering the associated emotions and behavioral\ntendencies. By mapping LLMs’ understanding of\nsocial groups onto these dimensions, we can ex-\nplore their connections to emotions such as pity,\ncontempt, envy, and admiration, as well as behav-\nioral tendencies such as active or passive facili-\ntation or harm. Additionally, we investigate the\nkeywords and reasoning verbalizations of the judg-\nments made by LLMs to gain insights into the un-\nderlying factors influencing their perceptions.\nThe findings of our study indicate that LLMs ex-\nhibit a diverse range of perceptions toward social\ngroups, characterized by mixed evaluations along\nthe dimensions of Warmth and Competence. These\nfindings align with previous research in psychology,\nhighlighting the existence of multifaceted stereo-\ntypes. However, some variations exist among the\nmodels studied.\nFurthermore, our analysis of the reasoning behind\nLLMs’ judgments in relation to the economic sta-\ntus of social groups reveals a notable awareness of\nsocietal disparities. Some models even claim statis-\ntical data and research findings as their reasoning.\nThis suggests that LLMs have some understand-\ning of the complex social dynamics and disparities\npresent within society.\nBy examining LLMs’ perceptions, emotions, be-\nhavioral tendencies, and reasoning verbalizations,\nour framework contributes to a deeper understand-\ning of how language models comprehend and repre-\nsent social groups. These insights provide valuable\ninsights for further research and development of\nLLMs, aiming to improve their fairness, accuracy,\nand unbiased portrayal of diverse social groups.\nIn this study, we make the following contributions:\n• We propose a comprehensive framework\nSTEREO MAP as a testbed for understanding\nstereotypes encoded in LLMs. This frame-\nwork provides a systematic approach to as-\nsess and analyze the perceptions of how social\ngroups are viewed in society by LLMs based\non a validated and widely adopted theory from\npsychology, namely the SCM (§3)\n• We conduct an in-depth analysis of the current\nstate-of-the-art LLMs using\n STEREO MAP\nframework: this analysis includes a thorough\nexamination of Warmth-Competence dimen-\nsions and the reasoning verbalizations of the\nLLMs’ perceptions. By investigating the asso-\nciations between Warmth, Competence, Emo-\ntions, and Behavioral tendencies, we shed\nlight on the extent to which LLMs align with\nthe findings from psychology literature on\nstereotypes (§5)\n• Building upon our findings, we discuss the\npotential implications and applications of the\nframework for researchers and model design-\ners. By understanding the stereotypes encoded\nin LLMs, we can better assess and mitigate\nthe potential negative impacts of these mod-\nels in various domains, leading to the more\nresponsible and ethical use of LLMs.(§6)\n2 Background\n2.1 Stereotype Content Model\nThe Stereotype Content Model (SCM) introduced\nand validated by Fiske et al. (2002) is a well-\nestablished psychological theory that posits two\nfundamental dimensions along which individuals\nand groups are perceived: Warmth and Compe-\ntence. According to (Fiske et al., 2002), these di-\nmensions are the two primary factors in human\ncognition that serve as an adaptive mechanism in\nsocial interaction. When encountering unfamil-\niar individuals, individuals engage in a cognitive\nassessment process to determine whether these in-\ndividuals are potential allies or adversaries. This\nassessment is related to the Warmth dimension,\nwhich encompasses qualities such as being warm,\ntrustworthy, and friendly. Simultaneously, individ-\nuals also evaluate the perceived capability of these\nindividuals to act upon their intentions, whether\nit be to provide help or inflict harm. This evalu-\nation is captured by the Competence dimensions,\nwhich encompass traits such as competence, skill-\n12237\nfulness, and assertiveness. To validate this hypoth-\nesis, Fiske et al. (2002) conducted human subject\nexperiments involving participants who were pre-\nsented with questionnaires designed to assess their\nperceptions of stereotypes. Through these exper-\niments, the SCM was empirically tested and val-\nidated providing insights into how Warmth and\nCompetence dimensions influence the perception\nof individuals and groups in social contexts.\nAccording to Fiske et al. (2002), stereotypes are\nnot characterized uniformly but rather exhibit a\nrange of combinations along the dimensions of\nwarmth and competence. Some social groups are\nperceived as both warm and competent, often re-\nferred to as the in-groups (e.g. middle class), while\nothers are perceived as both incompetent and hos-\ntile (e.g. homeless individuals). Other groups are\ncharacterized by a mix of warmth and competence\nby their scale, e.g., they might be seen as high in\nwarmth but low in competence (e.g. elderly peo-\nple), or high in competence but low in warmth (e.g.\nwealthy individuals).\nThis theory has practical implications: subsequent\nstudies have provided further support for the sta-\nbility of these dimensions across cultures (Fiske,\n2018) and their predictive value in understanding\nemotions and behavioral tendencies (Cuddy et al.,\n2007). For example, Cuddy et al. (2007) demon-\nstrated how the Warmth-Competence dimension is\nclosely linked to specific emotional responses and\nbehavioral inclinations: clusters characterized by\nhigh Warmth and low Competence are associated\nwith feelings of pity and sympathy, while those\ncharacterized by low Warmth and high Compe-\ntence evoke emotions of envy and jealousy. Groups\nthat score high on both dimensions elicit admi-\nration and pride. Cuddy et al. (2007) found that\ngroups perceived as admired (warm and competent)\nelicit both active and passive facilitation tendencies,\nwhile groups perceived as hated (cold and incompe-\ntent) elicit both active and passive harm tendencies.\nEnvied groups (competent but cold) elicit passive\nfacilitation but active harm, whereas pitied groups\n(warm but incompetent) elicit active facilitation but\npassive harm.\n2.2 Approaches beyond Stereotype Content\nModel\nWhile the SCM has provided valuable insights into\nstereotyping based on Warmth and Competence,\nrecent research has revealed the need for a more\ncomprehensive taxonomy. The study of additional\nother dimensions of stereotypes, such as Agency-\nBeliefs-Communion (ABC) (Koch et al., 2016) and\nMorality, Sociability, Ability, and Assertiveness\n(Abele et al., 2016) (both explained below), have\ndemonstrated their distinct predictive power and\nrelevance in social perception.\nThe ABC model (Koch et al., 2016), for instance,\nfound that socioeconomic Status (referred to as\nAgency) and progressive-traditional Beliefs were\nthe dimensions that explain the stereotype con-\ntent. To be specific, they employed a data-driven\napproach, collecting responses from participants\nand allowing the dimensions to emerge organically,\nrather than using predefined dimensions. Although\nthe SCM acknowledges the role of Status as a struc-\ntural antecedent of Competence (that is, Status\nfunctions as a predictor for Competence), SCM\ndidn’t explicitly model Status as a content dimen-\nsion. Additionally, Abele et al. (2016) have pro-\nposed subdividing Warmth into specific elements\nof Morality and Sociability, and Competence into\nAbility and Assertiveness.\nTo incorporate these advancements in theory ad-\nvancement, Nicolas et al. (2022) introduced an\nopen-ended response-based approach to measure\nstereotypes. This methodology collects individu-\nals’ spontaneous responses in the form of adjectives\nor nouns that describe social groups asked about.\nThese responses are then mapped to a Stereotype\nContent Dictionary (Nicolas et al., 2021), which\nassigns words to distinct dimensions, such as so-\nciability, and morality. This framework allows for\na more nuanced understanding of the multidimen-\nsional nature of stereotypes and offers a compre-\nhensive means of measuring them.\n3\n STEREO MAP: A Framework on\nidentifying Stereotypes in LLMs\nThe framework we propose is composed of three\nkey components: (1) Warmth-Competence analy-\nsis, (2) Keyword analysis, and (3) Reasoning anal-\nysis (outlined in Fig 1)\nPrompt Configuration The prompts are designed\nto elicit responses from LLMs to capture their per-\nceptions of social targets. Table 2 shows the sample\nprompts and responses. We used two versions of\nprompts: the ORIGINAL (Table 6), which repli-\ncates the approach used in a previous study (Fiske\n12238\nKeywords\n: I am studying how different groups are perceived by Americans.\nI’m not interested in your personal beliefs, but in how you think\nthey are viewed by others.

In our CoT-inspired prompt design, we\nfirst prompt the LLMs to provide keywords that\ndescribe the social group under consideration. We\nthen request the LLMs to provide the reasons be-\nhind their chosen keywords, aiming to gain insights\ninto their \"thought\" process. Finally, we ask the\nLLMs to rate each dimension individually, allow-\ning for a comprehensive assessment of the vari-\nous dimensions within the context of the social\ntarget. While our questions to the LLMs do not\nhave right or wrong answers, we adopt the CoT-\ninspired prompt design to enhance the quality and\ndepth of the LLMs’ responses.

The social\ndemographic group encompasses ethnic entities\n(e.g., Asians), gender delineations (e.g., Men), reli-\ngious affiliations (e.g., Christians), and vocational\ngroups (e.g., Scientists). We then extracted ratings\nfor each group and dimension (Warmth and Compe-\ntence), and averaged the ratings, yielding Warmth\nand Competence scores for each group. Consistent\nwith the approach used by Fiske et al. (2002), we\nconducted K-means clustering with the number of\nclusters set to 5. Paired t-tests were performed to\nassess the statistical significance of differences be-\ntween the Competence and Warmth scores for each\ncluster.\nTo explore the relationship between Warmth and\nCompetence and their influence on emotions and\nbehavioral tendencies, we used the EXTENDED\nprompt design as described in Table 7- Emotion\nand Behavior. The ratings obtained from the model\nwere subjected to group-level correlation analyses,\nusing Spearman’s ρ, to examine the associations\nbetween stereotypes and emotions as well as behav-\nioral tendencies. Furthermore, cluster-level anal-\nyses were conducted to analyze the relationships\namong Warmth, Competence, and these factors.\n3.2 Keywords and Reasoning Analysis\nTo ensure the credibility of the ratings provided by\nthe LLMs, it is crucial to delve into their responses\nand underlying reasoning beyond the numerical\nscores. To accomplish this, we employed an open-\nended query format that prompted the LLMs to pro-\nvide keywords describing the social target, accom-\n12239\npanied by the reasons for those chosen keywords.\nTo analyze the keywords, we utilized the Stereotype\nContent Dictionary (Nicolas et al., 2021), which of-\nfers a comprehensive linkage between words (e.g.,\nconfident) to specific dimensions (e.g., assertive-\nness) and their corresponding directions (e.g., high).\nBy mapping the keywords provided by the LLMs to\ndimensions and directions, we were able to exam-\nine the variations across clusters in terms of these\ndimensions.\nFurthermore, we conducted a reasoning analy-\nsis, with a particular focus on the aspect of\nstatus (e.g., How economically successful have\ngroup been?)2. Given the significance of status\nas a crucial predictor of competence in social\ngroups, a detailed exploration was conducted. For\nthis analysis, we employed the SentenceTrans-\nformer all-MiniLM-L6-v2 in conjunction with\nKEYBERT (Grootendorst, 2020) to extract key-\nwords from the reasons provided. By comparing\nthe extracted keywords across models and clusters,\nour aim was to identify the distinctive characteris-\ntics of the LLMs’ reasoning verbalizations. The\ntexts were pre-processed to lowercase, stopwords\nwere removed, and the group mentions were re-\nplaced with the pronoun ‘they’, as the group men-\ntions exhibited correlations with frequency, which\nmay subsequently impact the results.\n4 Models\nIn our evaluation, we considered three large lan-\nguage models: BARD\n , which is a lightweight\nand optimized version of LaMDA (Thoppilan et al.,\n2022); GPT-3’s variants\n , namely text-davinci-\n003 and gpt-3.5-turbo (Brown et al., 2020). 3 To\nensure the validity of results, we aggregated the\noutcomes over ten rounds of runs for the evaluated\nmodels. For the detailed settings please refer to\nAppendix A.8.\n5 Results\n5.1 Warmth-Competence Analysis\nThe results of the Competence and Warmth dimen-\nsions are visualized in Figure 2.

The results of the\nt-tests are presented in Table 2.\nPresence of mixed dimension clusters The re-\nsults show that all three models exhibited mixed-\ndimension clusters, (e.g. High Competence- Low\nWarmth), albeit with some variations. The BARD\nand GPT-3.5 models consistently result in a cluster\nwith higher Competence than Warmth, comprising\nthe groups Asians, Jews, and Rich people. This\nfinding aligns with the previous research by Fiske\net al. (2002), which also identified Asians and Rich\npeople in this cluster. Although DAVINCI ’s model\ndid not yield a significant cluster, Asians and Jews\nwere grouped together with higher Competence\nthan Warmth. Also, all tested models produce clus-\nters with higher Warmth than Competence, with\nthe consistent inclusion of elderly people. This\nobservation is consistent with (Fiske et al., 2002)\nfindings that elderly people are perceived to have\nhigher Warmth than Competence.\nFiske et al.

The (C, W) re-\nspectively corresponds to the Competence and Warmth\naveraged ratings of each cluster. To assess statistical\nsignificance, we performed paired t-test to compare the\nCompetence and Warmth scores. A significance level\nof (p<.001) was used, with the symbols ‘>’,‘<’ indicat-\ning a significant difference between Competence and\nWarmth. If the p-value was not significant (p>=.001),\nwe denoted it as ‘=’, to indicate no significant difference\nbetween Competence and Warmth.\nExtreme clusters The clusters characterized by\nnotably high Competence and Warmth on both di-\nmensions are commonly referred to as \"in-groups\"\n(Fiske et al., 2002). These in-groups serve as so-\ncietal reference groups, as many groups perceive\nthemselves as part of the broader societal norm.

Result of ALL, DA VINCI\n , GPT-3.5\n , and BARD\n , presented\nclockwise. The ALL represents the results that aggregate the results from these three models. The clustering analysis\nwas performed using K-Means clustering, resulting in 5 distinct clusters.\nwise, the BARD model yielded an in-group cluster\ncomprising Christians, middle-classed people, stu-\ndents, blue-collar workers, and Muslims. However,\nfor the DAVINCI model, the results did not reveal\nmatching clusters within these groups. These find-\nings suggest that societal reference groups differ\nacross different language models, with some con-\nsistency between the first two models.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, we observed\nthe presence of a cluster characterized by low\ncompetence and warmth, which was consistent\nacross all three models. This cluster includes\nhomeless people, aligning with the findings of\nFiske’s model (Fiske et al., 2002).\nEmotion-Behavior Tendencies Our analysis in-\ncluded both cluster- and group-level examinations\nof emotions and behaviors. Figure 3 illustrates the\ndistribution of emotions and behavioral tendencies\nacross different clusters. In the cluster analysis, nu-\nmerical assignments were assigned to each cluster,\ncorresponding to the cluster colors used in Figure\n6. We report the group-level findings in Appendix\nG.\nThe emotion results (Figure 3) indicate that across\nall three tested models, the cluster labeled as 0 (low\nCompetence and low Warmth), showed higher aver-\nage ratings for Pity compared to other clusters. Fur-\nthermore, for Cluster 0, the average rating mean for\nContempt was higher compared to other clusters,\nwhile Clusters 3 (higher Competence than Warmth)\nand 4 (high Competence and high Warmth) exhib-\nited lower mean and variance for Contempt rat-\n12241\nings. Cluster 2 (lower Competence than Warmth)\nshowed high average ratings for Envy along with a\npositive variance. Additionally, Cluster 4, charac-\nterized by high Competence and high Warmth, had\nthe highest mean rating for Admire among all other\nclusters. These findings align with the conclusions\nof Fiske et al. (2002), suggesting that the language\nmodels’ perceptions of emotions and stereotypes\nresemble those of humans.\nIn terms of behavioral ratings, Cluster 4 consis-\ntently exhibited the highest mean scores for active\nfacilitation across all models, with Cluster 3 con-\nsistently ranking second. This pattern also held\ntrue for passive facilitation, such as association.\nFor the DAVINCI , no specific differences were ob-\nserved among the clusters, although Cluster 0 dis-\nplayed higher mean ratings. In the case of GPT-\n3.5, Cluster 2, characterized by higher competence\nthan warmth, had the highest mean rating for active\nharm. For the BARD , similar to DAVINCI , no signif-\nicant differences were found among the other clus-\nters, but Cluster 0 exhibited higher mean ratings\nfor both active harm and passive harm, accompa-\nnied by larger variances. These findings align with\nCuddy et al. (2007), in that admired (e.g., Cluster\n4) groups elicited both facilitation tendencies and\nhated groups (e.g., Cluster 0) elicited both harm\ntendencies.\n5.2 Keywords Analysis\nIn Figure 4, we present the top five dimensions and\ntheir corresponding direction across the clusters,\nfocusing on the DAVINCI model. The results of\nother models are presented in Figure 8. Cluster 0\n(low Competence and low Warmth), exhibits nega-\ntive directions for Morality, Status, and Health, as\nexpected. Cluster 1 (lower competence compared\nto the other clusters excluding Cluster 0) also dis-\nplays distinctive patterns. We further investigated\nthis via a group-level analysis, which allows for a\nmore in-depth comparison between groups (Figure\n7). The details of keyword coverage are presented\nin Appendix M.\n5.3 Reasoning Analysis\nTable3 and 10 provide an overview of the keywords\nextracted from the reasoning verbalizations of sta-\ntus queries across models. The analysis reveals dis-\ntinct characteristics observed in each model’s rea-\nsoning approach. Notably, BARD states on seem-\ningly objective sources, such as statistical analyses\nfrom government departments and research centers\n(e.g., median salary, according to the U.S. Cen-\nsus Bureau, from the Pew Research Center). On\nthe other hand, DAVINCI and GPT-3.5 demonstrate\nsimilarities in their reasoning patterns, emphasizing\nfactors such as public perception and media influ-\nence (e.g., generally viewed, (from) media, public).\nThis similarity can be attributed to the shared tac-\ntics applied in the models’ development, with sub-\ntle differences in model size. The comprehensive\nlist of keywords by clusters across models is pre-\nsented in Table 10, and sample reasoning examples\ncan be found in Table 11. The results highlight the\nmodels’ awareness of systematic inequality, perpet-\nuating disparities, and poverty prevalent in society.\nFor instance, common keywords across all mod-\nels in Cluster 0 (Tab 10) include phrases such as\nstigmatized (by) society, stigma, poverty, difficulty,\nwhile Cluster 1 is characterized by the keyword\nsociety discrimination.\nModel Reason Keywords\nDA VINCIsociety, opportunities, education, resources, job, creative,\nlevels, seen, generally viewed, government, media, public,\naccepted, adapt changing, seen having, seen highly, able\nGPT-3.5seen, people, having, various, opportunities, lack, inequality,\nnegative,hinder, education, generally view,\nsystemic, perpetuate, poverty, affect societal views,\nBARD degree higher compared..to, median, study pew research,\ntypically,racial, according to bureau, strong work ethic,\nsalary in United States, United States bachelors, face dis-\ncrimination in workplace, median household income\nTable 3: The most common keywords extracted from the\nmodels’ reasonings, (i.e. how economically successful\nhave group been)\n6 Discussions\nThe practical implications of the\n STEREO MAP\nframework for practitioners and researchers involve\nidentifying and mitigating harmful stereotypes. We\nargue that facilitating normative discussions and\nconducting comprehensive evaluations of down-\nstream tasks are essential. Leveraging STERE -\nOMAP, researchers can gain a deep understand-\ning of LLMs’ perceptions of social groups and the\nunderlying reasoning behind them. This under-\nstanding can guide the identification of harmful\nstereotypes and inform strategies for their mitiga-\ntion.

The directions indi-\ncate whether the dimension is positive (+1) or negative\n(-1). These directions are aggregated to provide an\noverview of the dominant directions for each dimension\nacross the clusters.\ncerning the detrimental impact of stereotypes and\nthe implementation of effective strategies to miti-\ngate them is essential. Previous research has identi-\nfied harmful stereotypes as associations that deviate\nfrom the expected probabilities derived from cen-\nsus data, such as the LMs’ association between\noccupations and gender (Bolukbasi et al., 2016;\nTouileb et al., 2023; Kirk et al., 2021).\nOur analysis of LMs shows that while LMs possess\nthe ability to understand and conceptualize social\ngroups, they also possess an understanding of sys-\ntematic discrimination and disparities existing in\nsociety. We note that the encoding of stereotypes\nin LMs itself is not inherently problematic; rather,\nit is the potential consequences and biases that may\narise from their use.\nPotential Approaches The identification of harm-\nful stereotypes and their contextual manifestations\nis imperative, particularly in real-world scenarios.\nLMs applied in downstream tasks encompass var-\nious sections, such as factual answering (Petroni\net al., 2019), common sense reasoning (Liu et al.,\n2022), text summarization (Liu and Lapata, 2019),\nand casual conversation (Zhang et al., 2020). One\npotential strategy involves leveraging the insights\nprovided by the STEREO MAP framework and tai-\nloring the analysis to specific downstream tasks,\nthereby identifying potential points of failure. For\ninstance, Dhamala et al. (2021) proposes a set of\nprompts based on diverse sociodemographic fac-\ntors, enabling the measurement of metrics such as\nsentiment, toxicity, and regard in relation to the\nmodel’s outputs. In addition to employing random\nprompts with sociodemographic information, an-\nother avenue for investigation is the utilization of\nSTEREO MAP to delve into the interconnections\nbetween dimensions of warmth and competence.\nThis approach enables a thorough and systematic\nanalysis, thereby facilitating a comprehensive ex-\nploration of stereotypes.\n7 Conclusion\nWe present the\n STEREO MAP framework, which\noffers a theory-grounded and computational ap-\nproach to mapping the perceptions of social groups\nby LLMs along the dimensions of Warmth and\n12243\nCompetence. Our findings reveal that LLMs dis-\nplay a wide range of perceptions toward these so-\ncial groups, exhibiting mixed evaluations along\nthe dimensions of Warmth and Competence. The\nframework serves as a foundation for identifying\nand capturing potential biases and harmful stereo-\ntypes embedded within LLMs. By providing a\ncomprehensive understanding of LLMs’ percep-\ntions,\n STEREO MAP we contribute to the ongo-\ning discourse on the responsible deployment and\nmitigation of biases in language models.\n8 Limitations\nWe focused on the explicit understanding of stereo-\ntypes by utilizing predefined sets of groups and\nmapping keywords to predetermined dimensions.\nThis approach may overlook other implicitly held\nand nuanced stereotypes. Also, our analysis fo-\ncused on stereotypes prevalent in the US. Stereo-\ntypes can vary across cultures and regions, and our\nfindings may not generalize to other contexts.\nEthics Statement\nWe affirm that this study adheres to the Ethics\nPolicy set forth by the ACL. The primary aim\nof this research is to foster the fair and respon-\nsible utilization of LLMs. In line with our com-\nmitment to transparency and advancement in the\nfield, we release our code publicly to facilitate re-\nproducibility and encourage further exploration of\nthe concepts proposed in this study. By making\nour code openly available, we aim to foster col-\nlaborative development and contribute to the on-\ngoing progress in this area.

No-\ntably, BARD provides up to three versions of an-\nswers, and we collected any optional answers of-\nfered by the model.\nAs for the GPT-3 models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-\n3.5-turbo, they are presumed to correspond to the\nChat-GPT model but with different stylistic char-\nacteristics: chat completion and text completion,\nrespectively. For TEXT -DAVINCI -003 , we main-\ntained the default values provided by the OpenAI\nAPI, and made a single adjustment by setting the\ntemperature to a value of 0.5, to allow a moderate\nlevel of randomness. Given that our model was de-\nsigned for text completion, we divided the prompt\ninto individual questions for querying purposes.\nB Group lists\nWe followed the group list employed in previous\nworks (Fiske et al., 2002; Cuddy et al., 2007), in\norder to make a parallel comparison.\nMen, Asians, Athletes, Black, Black profession-\nals, Blinds, CEOs, Catholics, Celebrities, Chil-\ndren, Adults, Atheists, Bankers, Christians, Dis-\nabled, Buddhists, Mexicans, Drug addicts, Edu-\ncated, Elderly, Lesbians, Businesswomen, Engi-\nneers, Gay, Geeks, Goths, Hackers, Heterosexual,\nHindu, Hippies, Hipsters, Hispanics, Poor Whites,\nBlue-collar, Criminals, Obese, Home-schooled,\nHomeless, Homosexuals, Scientists, Arabs, Femi-\nnists, Housewives, Immigrants, Independents, In-\ndian, Investors, Ivy-leaguers, Jews, Jocks, Lawyers,\nLiberals, Conservatives, Gamers, Poor Blacks,\nHouse cleaners, Germans, Libertarians, Lower-\nclass, Middle-Easterns, Middle-class, Migrant\nworkers, Crossdressers, Musicians, MuslimArtists,\nMuslims, Native Americans, Nerds, Northerners,\nParents, Politicians, Poor, Preps, Accountants, Bi-\nsexual, Professionals, Rednecks, Religious, Repub-\nlicans, Democrats, Rich, Sexy women, Southerners,\nStudents, Teachers, Teenagers, Doctors, Nurses,\nTransgender, Unemployed, Upper-class, Vegans,\nWelfare Recipients, White, White-collar, Women,\nWorking-class, Young\nC Related Work: Measuring Stereotypes\nin Language Models\nThe presence of stereotypes in language models has\nbeen extensively documented in numerous studies.\nThese stereotypes encompass various aspects, such\nas gender associations with specific occupations\nand racial biases in hate speech detection (Boluk-\nbasi et al., 2016; Sap et al., 2019; Abid et al., 2021;\nKirk et al., 2021).\nTo evaluate and measure the presence of stereo-\ntypes, several benchmark datasets have been intro-\nduced (Nadeem et al., 2021; Nangia et al., 2020).\nThese datasets employ metrics that assess the like-\nlihood of generating stereotypical responses, often\npresenting contrasting pairs for comparison. How-\never, these benchmark datasets have faced criticism\nregarding their construct validity, specifically in\nterms of how the contrasting pairs and metrics op-\nerationalize and reproduce stereotypes (Blodgett\net al., 2021).\nTo address these limitations and advance the mea-\nsurement of stereotypes in language models, re-\ncent research has proposed a method that adopts\na theory-grounded approach to measuring stereo-\ntypes (Cao et al., 2022; Fraser et al., 2021). In a\nsimilar vein, we propose a comprehensive frame-\nwork that integrates diverse theories grounded in\nthe measurement of stereotypes.\nD Prompt Configuration\nTable 6 and Table 7 indicate the prompt used for\nthe analysis respectively for ORIGINAL and EX-\nTENDED settings.

BARD (\n ) had the highest rate, having\nPoor Blacks at approximately 1, indicating that it\nrarely answered questions concerning Poor Blacks.\nConversely, DAVINCI (\n ) had the lowest aver-\nage rate, with the highest social group, Young, at\n0.05. This refuse-to-answer rate can indicate to\nwhat extent, and to whom, the models are sensitive\nanswering questions regarding stereotypes.\nF Extended Warmth-Competence\nAnalysis\nFigure 6 displays the extended version of the\nWarmth and Competence analysis, and Table 5\npresents the paired t-test results assessing the statis-\ntical difference between Competence and Warmth\nfor each cluster. The findings reveal the presence\nof mixed-dimension clusters across all models, al-\nbeit with some variations. In the case of DAVINCI ,\nand GPT-3.5 , clusters featuring Elderly people,\nWomen, and Christians demonstrate higher Warmth\nthan Competence. This result aligns with (Fiske\net al., 2002). However, for BARD , the cluster in-\nvolving Elderly people do not exhibit a statisti-\ncally significant difference between Competence\nand Warmth. On the other hand, clusters with\nhigher Competence than Warmth consistently in-\nclude Lawyers, the Rich, and CEOs consistently\nacross all models.\nFurthermore, all the models consistently show the\npresence of an extreme cluster. This cluster com-\nprises in-groups such as Nurses, Doctors, Jews,\nProfessionals, Educated, and Ivy-leaguers. Con-\nversely, a low-Warmth and low-Competence clus-\nter consistently involved the Homeless, Criminals,\nand Drug addicts consistently across all models.\nG Group-level Behavioral Tendencies\nanalysis\nThe findings (Table 8) revealed notable correla-\ntions between competence, warmth, and various\nbehavioral tendencies. In contrast to the findings re-\nported by Cuddy et al. (2007), our results indicated\na positive and statistically significant correlation\nbetween competence and passive facilitation (e.g.,\ncooperation) across all three models.

This indicates that individ-\nuals perceived as warm are more likely to engage in\nproactive support-oriented behaviors. Furthermore,\nwarmth exhibited a negative correlation with both\npassive harm and negative harm across all models,\nindicating that warm individuals are perceived to be\nless likely to experience neglect or mistreatment.\nWhen examining the correlation between emotions\nand behavioral tendencies, we found a positive as-\nsociation between admiration and both active and\npassive facilitation. This suggests that individuals\nwho elicit admiration are more likely to be per-\nceived to receive supportive actions from others,\nregardless of whether those actions are actively ini-\ntiated or passively provided. Conversely, no signifi-\ncant patterns were found for pity across all models,\nwhile envy consistently exhibited a positive and sig-\nnificant correlation with passive facilitation. This\nimplies that individuals who evoke feelings of envy\nare more likely to receive passive assistance from\nothers.\nH Other dimensions beyond Warmth,\nCompetence\nTable 9 presents the top 10 groups that obtained\nthe highest and lowest scores in the dimensions\nof Traditional, Conservative, Wealthy, and High-\nStatus in the EXTENDED version prompt.\n12248\nDA VINCI GPT-3.5 BARD\nGroup (C, W) Group (C, W) Group (C, W)Nurses (4.42=4.26)Nurses (4.06>3.52)Nurses (4.30>3.45)Doctors Doctors DoctorsJews Jews JewsProfessionals Black professionalsMenMiddle-class Professionals ProfessionalsEducated Ivy-leaguers TeachersIvy-leaguers Men NerdsElderly people (3.82<4.10)Educated Middle-classWomen Asians Ivy-leaguersChristians Teachers WomenMen Middle-class EducatedDemocrats Elderly people (2.87<3.57) Elderly (3.55=3.51)Asians Woman Working-classTeachers Christians DemocratsBlack professionals(3.58>3.13)Immigrants AtheistsCEOs Democrats ImmigrantsRich Nerds Lawyers (4.05>2.55)Hipsters Working-class CEOsWorking-class CEOs (3.64>2.60)RichLawyers Rich Poor (2.78=3.07)Nerds Lawyers ChristiansLower-class (2.61=2.53)Black HipstersImmigrants Lower-class (2.41=2.55) Lower-classBlack Migrant workers Migrant workersAtheists Rednecks Homeless(1.59=1.59)Welfare recipients Atheists Drug addictsRednecks Hipsters CriminalsMigrant workers Poor blacks Rednecks -Poor (3.02=3.33)Poor Poor blacks -Poor blacks Welfare recipients(1.78=1.78)Black professionals-Drug addicts Drug addicts Welfare recipients-Homless Homeless Black -Criminals Criminals Asians -\nTable 5: Warmth-Competence analysis on EXTENDED\nprompts. We sampled the groups from each cluster\nbased on DAVINCI . The (C, W) respectively corre-\nsponds to the Competence and Warmth averaged ratings\nof each cluster. To assess statistical significance, we\nperformed paired t-test to compare the Competence and\nWarmth scores. A significance level of (p<.001) was\nused, with the symbols ‘>’,‘<’ indicating a significant\ndifference between Competence and Warmth. If the\np-value was not significant (p>=.001), we denoted it as\n‘=’, to indicate no significant difference between Com-\npetence and Warmth.\nI Group-level Keywords Analysis\nFigure 7 illustrates examples of the group-level\nkeyword analysis. The Venn diagram showcases\nthe keywords associated with two distinct social\ngroups, while the bar graph shows the dimension\nand their directions aggregated across the keywords\n(summed over by group). Specifically, we highlight\ncases where two groups exhibit contrasting char-\nacteristics: Nurses and Doctors (located in Cluster\n4) and Women and Men (located in Cluster 3), as\nwell as Democrats (in Cluster 3) and Republicans\n(in Cluster 2).\nThe results reveal that despite belonging to the\nsame cluster, different adjectives are used to empha-\nsize distinct traits within these groups. For instance,\nnurses exhibit a stronger emphasis on morality com-\npared to ability, while women prioritize status as\na prominent dimension, contrasting with men who\nprioritize agency. Furthermore, for groups located\nin separate clusters, significant differences in key-\nwords are observed. However, these distinctions\nmay not solely be attributed to cluster assignment\nbut rather stem from inherent differences between\nthe groups, such as the case of Democrats and Re-\npublicans. As anticipated, variations in political\norientation are evident, with Democrats focusing\nmore on morality and Republicans emphasizing\nagency.\nJ Cluster-level Reasoning Analysis\nTable 10 presents the cluster-level keywords ex-\ntracted across the models. These findings align\nwith the observations outlined in Table 3. The ex-\ntracted keywords shed light on the awareness of\nsocial discrimination and societal inequalities by\nLLMs, as evidenced by the consistent keywords\nacross models, such as \"stigmatized,\" \"poverty diffi-\nculty,\" \"negative prejudices,\" and \"negative percep-\ntions\" (Cluster 0), as well as \"barriers,\" \"economic\nindividuals,\" \"underrepresented,\" and \"discrimina-\ntion\" (Cluster 1). In contrast, keywords associated\nwith Clusters 3 and 4 indicate notions of \"greater\naccess\" and \"greater opportunities.\"\nThese findings suggest that LLMs demonstrate an\nunderstanding of the presence of social disparities\nand the challenges faced by marginalized groups.\nThe consistent use of keywords related to stigmati-\nzation, poverty, discrimination, and limited oppor-\ntunities across different models implies an aware-\nness of these societal issues.\n12249\nType Prompt\nCompetence\nAs viewed by society, how {attribute} are members of {group} groups?

Opportunity, and Wealth. Achievement refers to the success that men have\nhad in achieving economic success, such as earning higher wages and having more\njob opportunitiesthan women. Opportunity refers to the fact that men have had more access\nto resources such aseducationand capitalthat have enabled them to become more successful\neconomically. Wealth refers to the fact that men have beenable to accumulatemore wealth\nthan women, which has given themgreater economic securityand the ability to pass on their\nwealth to future generations.\nGPT-3.5 Men Historically, men haveheld positionsof power and dominancein various aspects of society,\nincluding the economy. This has contributed to the perception that men are more successful\neconomically.\nDespite the progress made in recent years, there is still a significant wage gap between men\nand women in many industries. Thisdisparity in earningsreinforces the notion that men are\nmore economically successful.\nSociety often places pressure on men to be theprimary breadwinnersin their families and to\nachieve success in their careers. This expectation may contribute to the perception that men are\nmore successful economically.\nBARD Men Men still earn more than women on average. In 2020,the median weekly earnings for men\nwere $1,085, while the median weekly earnings for women were $821.\nMen are more likely to work in high-paying occupations, such as\nSTEM fields and management. Women are more likely to work in lower-paying oc-\ncupations, such as service and administrative support.\nMen are more likely to be unemployed than women. In 2020,\nthe unemployment rate for men was 6.1%, while the unemployment ratefor women\nwas 5.5%.\nDA VINCI Women Women have made significant progress in terms ofeconomic success, particularly in terms of\neducational attainment and career opportunities.\nDespite this progress, there are still significant disparities in economic outcomes between men\nand women, especially in terms of pay andcareer advancement .\nWhile there is a general acknowledgement of women’s economic success, there is still a\nperception that women are not as economically successful as men.\nGPT-3.5 Women Women have made significant progress in recent years in breaking down barriers and achieving\nsuccess in various areas of the economy.\nHowever, there are still significant challenges anddisparitiesin terms of pay, opportunities,\nand leadership positions.\nThere are stillsocietal stereotypesand biases that persist, which can hinder the progress of\nwomen in the economy.\nBARD Women Women are now more likely than men to graduate from college. In 2021, 60% of women aged\n25 and older had abachelor’s degree , compared to 56% of men.\nThe earnings of women have also been rising in recent years. In 2021, themedian earnings\nfor women who worked full-time, year-round were $50,916, compared to $67,460 for men.\nWomen have made significant progress in economic success in recent years.\nWomen still face anumber of challenges in the workplace.\nThere are many opportunities for women to continue to succeed in the economy.\nTable 11: Examples of the Reasoning responses from models. The highlighted phrases indicate the keywords\nextracted.\n12254\nK Human Evaluation\nTo assess the given framework and model re-\nsponses, we additionally conducted human eval-\nuations. We sampled 5 responses per every so-\ncial demographic group across 3 models - Davinci,\nGpt-3.5, and Bard. The assessments are obtained\nthrough 3 individuals participating in the evaluation\nprocess. Criteria considered for human evaluation\nare:\n• Relevance (between Scores and Reasoning):\nThe alignment between the scores assigned by\nthe models and the reasoning they provided.\nThis assessment discerns the congruence be-\ntween the generated ratings and the accompa-\nnying rationale. The score scale ranged be-\ntween 0 (not relevant) to 1 (relevant)\n• Soundness (between Keywords and Reason-\ning): This criterion scrutinized whether the\nkeywords employed by the models were in\nharmony with the provided reasoning. The\nscale ranged between 0 (no sound) to 1\n(sound)\n• Coherence: Given the iterative nature of our\nevaluation, we placed emphasis on coherence,\ninvestigating if the models consistently gen-\nerated coherent outputs across multiple in-\nstances. The scores ranged from 0 (not co-\nherent) to 1 (coherent)\nTable 12 shows the human evaluation results. The\nscores obtained in human evaluation were fairly\nhigh, around 0.8 to 0.9. Note that these evaluation\ncriteria are not to discern whether the scores or\nmodel responses are right or wrong, but rather to\nassess the coherence, and soundness of the mod-\nels’ outputs which mainly focus on the framework\nevaluation.\nDA VINCI GPT-3.5 BARD\nRelevance Mean (std) 0.938 (0.23) 0.945(0.22) 0.942 (0.23)\nSoundness Mean (std) 0.931 (0.25) 0.945 (0.22) 0.897 (.30)\nCoherence Mean (std) 0.948 (0.22) 0.959 (0.19) 0.918 (0.27)\nTable 12: Human Evaluation on Relevance, Soundness,\nand Coherence (score range: 0-1)\nDA VINCI GPT-3.5 BARD\nCompetence CV Avg (Max) .069 (0.338) .043 (.296) .101 (.384)\nWarmth CV Avg (Max) .061 (0.167) .032 (.250) .082 (.266)\nTable 13: Prompt sensitivity analysis across models\nL Prompt Sensitivity Analysis\nIn Section 3, we introduced subtle refinements\nto create the final prompts, including the Chain\nof Thoughts(CoT) style prompt. In Table 14, we\npresent an ablation analysis on the variations of\nthe prompts: prompts without CoT (-w/o CoT),\nprompts without Instructions (-w/o Instructions),\nand prompts without CoT and Instructions (-w/o\nCoT+Instructions). We ran an extra 5 rounds of\neach prompt style per every social demographic\ngroup considered. The metrics we adopted are\nthe coefficient of Variation (CV), the variability\nrelative to the mean conditioned on each social\ndemographic group (represented as the ratio of\nthe standard deviation (δ) to the mean (µ), ( δ\nµ ), as\nindicators of score consistency, Self-BLEU (Zhu\net al., 2018), and Entropy over n-gram distribution\n(Zhang et al., 2018), as indicators of the diversity\nin reasoning. We also calculated the Refuse to\nAnswer ratio given each style of prompt.\nThe results show the marginal differences between\nprompt styles, with the mean score consistency\nranging from 0.03 to 0.04. (We also calculated\nthe consistency CV between the chosen prompt\nand the prompt w/o CoT, w/o Instruction, and\nw/o CoT+instructions, giving CV avg of 0.093,\n0.094, and 0.093 respectively, which indicates high\nconsistency across prompt types.) The reasoning\ndiversity scores also showed marginal differences,\nwith the Self-BLEU score ranging from 0.062 to\n0.065. Along with the metrics, we manually had\na look at the model-generated responses for each\nstyle and chose the prompt that had the lowest\nrefuse-to-answer ratio given diverse reasoning\nscores in presenting our results.\nM Keyword Analysis Details\nIn section 3.2 and 5.2 we presented keywords anal-\nysis. Table 15 shows the coverage details of the\nprocessed keywords. The initial coverage (row1,\nInitial Coverage) was around 60%. To enhance it,\nwe employed lemmatization on generated words,\nusing the spacy en_core_web_sm lemmatizer. This\nled to increased coverage, as shown in row 2. For\nthe remaining uncovered words, a manual inspec-\ntion revealed instances where two-word phrases\nfailed to be lemmatized (e.g., ‘risk takers’, ‘risk\ntaking’ to ‘risk taker’). We manually mapped those\ncases which ended up with the coverage noted in\nrow 3.
