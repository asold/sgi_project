  "full_text": "RESEARCH Open Access\nThe GUIDES checklist: development of a\ntool to improve the successful use of\nguideline-based computerised clinical\ndecision support\nStijn Van de Velde 1* , Ilkka Kunnamo 2, Pavel Roshanov 3, Tiina Kortteisto 4, Bert Aertgeerts 5, Per Olav Vandvik 6,7,\nSigne Flottorp 1,7, GUIDES expert panel\nAbstract\nBackground: Computerised decision support (CDS) based on trustworthy clinical guidelines is a key component\nof a learning healthcare system. Research shows that the effectiveness of CDS is mixed.\nMultifaceted context, system, recommendation and implementation factors may potentially affect the success of\nCDS interventions. This paper describes the development of a checklist that is intended to support professionals to\nimplement CDS successfully.\nMethods: We developed the checklist through an iterative process that involved a systematic review of evidence\nand frameworks, a synthesis of the success factors identified in the review, feedback from an international expert\npanel that evaluated the checklist in relation to a list of desirable framework attributes, consultations with patients\nand healthcare consumers and pilot testing of the checklist.\nResults: We screened 5347 papers and selected 71 papers with relevant information on success factors for\nguideline-based CDS. From the selected papers, we developed a 16-factor checklist that is divided in four domains,\ni.e. the CDS context, content, system and implementation domains. The panel of experts evaluated the checklist\npositively as an instrument that could support people implementing guideline-based CDS across a wide range of\nsettings globally. Patients and healthcare consumers identified guideline-based CDS as an important quality\nimprovement intervention and perceived the GUIDES checklist as a suitable and useful strategy.\nConclusions: The GUIDES checklist can support professionals in considering the factors that affect the success of\nCDS interventions. It may facilitate a deeper and more accurate understanding of the factors shaping CDS\neffectiveness. Relying on a structured approach may prevent that important factors are missed.\nKeywords: Clinical computerised decision support systems, Practice Guidelines, Guideline adherence,\nEvidence-based medicine, Implementation\n* Correspondence: Stijn.vandevelde@fhi.no\n1Centre for Informed Health Choices, Division for Health Services, Norwegian\nInstitute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Implementation Science  (2018) 13:86 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s13012-018-0772-3\nBackground\nIncreasing the value and reducing waste in healthcare are\nimportant issues within resource-constrained systems glo-\nbally [1]. Both the underuse and overuse of healthcare ser-\nvices can have serious consequences for people ’sh e a l t h\nand for healthcare spending [ 2– 4]. The most important\ndrivers of poor care fall into three domains: money and\nfinance; knowledge, bias and uncertainty; and power and\nhuman relationships [ 5]. Computerised decision support\n(CDS) based on trustworthy clinical guidelines can play a\nkey role in addressing some of these problems by improv-\ning knowledge, accelerating the adoption of new evidence\nand helping to better manage beliefs, assumptions and un-\ncertainty among healthcare providers and patients [ 3, 5].\nThe US National Academy of Medicine (formerly the\nInstitute of Medicine) has identified CDS as a key compo-\nnent of a learning healthcare system [ 6].\nCDS is a technology that provides patient-specific\nmedical knowledge at the point of need. Research into\nguideline-based CDS over the last 40 years has shown\nthat the effectiveness and success of CDS have been\nmixed [ 7]. Systematic reviews regarding CDS effective-\nness estimate on average modest increases in guideline\nadherence and modest reductions in morbidity [ 8, 9].\nCDS does obviously not work in isolation but it is part\nof a complicated mingling of determinants. Variations in\nsuccess may be due to problems with the CDS system,\nthe CDS content, and how the CDS is implemented or\nbecause CDS may not be able to provide a complete so-\nlution to complex problems [ 10]. Any decision to use\nCDS, or other additional interventions, should be based\non an assessment of the determinants of healthcare\npractice that affect whether the desired changes can be\nachieved [ 11]. Multiple reviews have evaluated determi-\nnants of successful development and use of CDS, for\nexample implementation of CDS in inpatient versus\noutpatient settings, CDS aimed at prevention or disease\nmanagement, integration of CDS in charting or order\nentry system and providing CDS to both clinicians and\npatients [ 12– 15]. An understanding of which factors or\ncombinations of factors make CDS more or less effective\nis still being developed [ 12, 16].\nThe aim of the GUIDES project was to improve the\nsuccessful use of guideline-based CDS through the de-\nvelopment of a checklist. The purpose of the checklist\nwas to facilitate a deeper and more accurate understand-\ning of which factors make CDS more (or less) effective\nand to guide CDS implementation by preventing key\nfactors from being overlooked.\nMethods\nWe developed the checklist in the following steps, as\npreviously published in a detailed protocol for the\nGUIDES project [ 17]: (1) a systematic review of the\nresearch evidence and frameworks on the factors affect-\ning success of guideline-based CDS, (2) a synthesis of\nthe factors identified and creation of the checklist and\n(3) pilot testing the checklist by testing it in a systematic\nreview of trials on CDS and by using it during focus\ngroup discussions about CDS success features. Cur-\nrently, there is no standardised methodology on how to\ndevelop a checklist. However, the steps included in this\nprocess allow broad input from diverse sources regard-\ning checklist content and design which matches with the\navailable guidance for checklist development [ 18, 19].\nStep 1: We (SV and SF) systematically reviewed frame-\nworks, systematic reviews, process evaluations and quali-\ntative evidence pertaining to factors for successful CDS\nimplementation according to a predefined protocol. In\nan additional review, we focussed on head-to-head trials\nevaluating success factors of interventions with CDS.\nStep 2: We extracted all the identified factors in the\nselected papers to develop the first version of the\nGUIDES checklist. An international group of experts\nwith experience in CDS and/or guidelines provided in-\nput and feedback in two rounds of consultation and one\napproval round. To compose the expert group, we in-\nvited first the corresponding authors of every relevant\npaper found in the review phase and combined this with\nthe suggestions by the members of the GUIDES project\nin order to achieve a balanced group with respect to\nmultidisciplinary representation and international repre-\nsentation. The experts gave their feedback through a\nstructured online feedback form that related to a list of\ndesirable framework attributes. We also collected the\nviews of patients and health care consumers in one\nround through an additional survey to ensure that the\nadopted strategies are relevant and acceptable to pa-\ntients. The detailed questions for each survey are avail-\nable in Additional files 1 and 2. The group of authors\ndiscussed the feedback from every consultation round\nand agreed on the revisions that we made. We also\nasked the panel of experts to judge if the included fac-\ntors were ‘always’, ‘sometimes’ or ‘never important ’ for\nthe success of guideline-based CDS interventions. Fur-\nther, we asked the experts to select what they regarded\nas the five most important factors and to rank their\nselection from the most important to the fifth most\nimportant. In parallel with the checklist, we also asked\nfeedback from the expert panel on three support work-\nsheets to help users to (1) select the most important rec-\nommendations for implementation, (2) evaluate which\nimplementation strategies are appropriate for the priori-\ntised recommendations and (3) assess if CDS is appro-\npriate for the selected recommendations.\nStep 3: We invited six colleagues with research back-\ngrounds to pilot the GUIDES checklist by rating a ran-\ndom sample of 30 trial reports that we identified during\nVan de Velde et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:86 Page 2 of 12\nour review of head-to-head trials. We asked the mem-\nbers of this group to think aloud as they applied the\nchecklist for the first time, and we made notes about\nhow they interacted with the checklist and how they\ninterpreted the different checklist factors. Two partici-\npants independently assessed each trial report, to make\njudgements about how well the CDS interventions per-\nformed in relation to the GUIDES factors for successful\nCDS. We calculated interrater agreement to assess\nconsistency of rating across the researchers.\nWe further piloted the checklist during six focus\ngroups with general practitioners and patients who\ndiscussed a CDS intervention intended to improve care\nand outcomes for patients with knee osteoarthritis. In\nthe focus group, participants discussed the factors that\ndetermine successful use of CDS during an initial brain-\nstorming phase. In a subsequent structured phase, the\nmoderator used the GUIDES checklist to ask probing\nquestions on factors that were not yet discussed. At the\nend of the interview, the participants individually se-\nlected five factors that they considered the most import-\nant for the successful use of the CDS strategy. We\nevaluated to what extent the checklist allowed us to\nidentify additional factors and how many of these factors\nwere rated as important by the participants. The focus\ngroups took place in Norway, Belgium and Finland. The\nmoderators emphasised that both positive and negative\nfeedback about the CDS intervention was important. We\naudio-recorded each focus group and an observer took\nnotes. We transcribed key parts of the focus groups but\nwe did not do a full transcription of the recordings.\nFurther details are available in a separate report [ 20].\nHere we reported the findings of an evaluation of the\nprocess we used to identify factors that could affect the\nsuccess of the suggested strategy.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the expert panel\nA panel of 49 experts provided online feedback to the\nGUIDES project. Twenty-two of the 49 experts had a\nbackground in evidence-based guidelines, 12 were\nhealthcare providers and 42 had a background in CDS.\nEight experts were active in CDS system development,\nimplementation and evaluation. Twelve were involved in\neducation, and four had governmental backgrounds, ei-\nther as CDS programme funders or as health policy ana-\nlysts. The majority of the experts (84%) had a research\nbackground. Seven participants had no experience of\nCDS. The areas of expertise are based on self-report by\nthe panel members.\nThe panel consisted of experts from 18 countries across\nfive continents. Ten experts had CDS experience in low-\nand middle-income countries. Eight reported financial re-\nlationships with entities in the health informatics arena;\nthree reported other relationships or activities that may\nhave been potential conflicts of interest. In both feedback\nrounds, the proportion of participants who responded was\nabove 90%. Four patients and healthcare consumers also\nprovided feedback through an additional survey.\nDevelopment of the checklist\nHere we describe the results of the literature review, the\nconsultation rounds and the pilot testing. Tables 1 and\n2, Figs. 1 and 2 and Additional file 3 provide further de-\ntails about the content of the GUIDES checklist we\ndeveloped.\nStep 1: Review of the research evidence and frameworks\nThe search identified 5347 papers. The final selection\nincluded 71 papers (including 21 frameworks, 16 sys-\ntematic reviews, 7 qualitative studies and 27 process\nevaluations related to CDS trials). We excluded several\nother systematic reviews because their scope was too\nnarrow, focusing for example on a specific clinical con-\ndition, setting or CDS function. We double-checked that\nno information was lost by excluding these reviews. We\nalso excluded some older systematic reviews because\nmore recent reviews of the same research question were\navailable. We double-checked that no information was\nlost by excluding these reviews.\nThe included frameworks most frequently discussed\nitems related to the ease of use of CDS systems, stepwise\nimplementation of CDS interventions, continuous im-\nprovements of CDS systems, CDS delivery methods,\nrelevance and accuracy of CDS and the trustworthiness\nof CDS content [ 21– 41]. The frameworks were often\nrooted in the experiences of particular national or re-\ngional settings. Fifteen frameworks were developed in\nthe USA, five in Europe and one in Australia. None of\nthe included frameworks met all the preferred\nTable 1 An overview of the GUIDES checklist\nThe checklist contains four CDS domains (Fig. 1). Each domain includes\nfour factors, making 16 factors in total (see Fig. 2).\nChecklist domains:\n Context: the circumstances in which CDS can be potentially\nsuccessful.\n Content: the factors shaping the success of the advice produced by\nthe CDS system.\n System: features belonging to the CDS tool.\n Implementation: factors affecting the integration of CDS into\npractice settings.\nThe full checklist (see Additional file 3) provides:\n A rationale for the importance of each factor.\n Sample questions to consider.\n Positive and negative examples.\nThe GUIDES checklist is available in different formats, including an\nelectronic version that enables CDS implementation teams to complete\nthe GUIDES checklist efficiently in a group\n(see https://www.guidesproject.org).\nVan de Velde et al.

The diverse goals of the frameworks made it\ndifficult to evaluate their usability. Most of the frame-\nworks were presented in research papers which detailed\nCDS classifications, the lessons learned or recommenda-\ntions. In only two instances was it explicitly mentioned\nthat CDS developers and/or implementers were the pri-\nmary target audience of the frameworks.\nThe systematic reviews evaluated a wide range of as-\npects related to the success of CDS interventions [ 12,\n42– 56]. The reviews focussed most on the role of the\nCDS setting and target, the methods to deliver the CDS\nand the trustworthiness of the decision support. In a\nseparate publication, we discuss these results in relation to\nthe findings of another systematic review that we con-\nducted ( Unpublished research submitted to Implementa-\ntion Science ). That report also rates the certainty of the\nevidence for every factor using the GRADE approach [ 57].\nThe qualitative studies and process evaluations that we\nincluded often discussed issues related to the acceptance\nof CDS, the ease of use of a CDS system and the role of\nother factors influencing compliance with decision sup-\nport advice [ 58– 91].\nStep 2: Synthesis of CDS success factors and\ndevelopment of GUIDES checklist\nFrom the selected papers, we extracted 816 excerpts that\nwere related to factors affecting CDS success. We coded all\nthe information contained in the excerpts and used this to\nconstruct a first checklist version. GUIDES checklist v1.1\nincluded 38 items classified in four domains, namely, the\nCDS context, content, system and implementation. The\nexpert panel provided input on this draft checklist, and we\nmade a number of important adjustments.\nIn the GUIDES checklist v1.2, we reduced the number\nof factors to 19 by grouping items under factors repre-\nsenting ‘higher-level’ concepts. No items were removed.\nFor each factor, we included a set of questions to help\nusers in their evaluation. Examples of positive and nega-\ntive impacts were included. Items that were complicated,\nunclear or ambiguous were reworded.\nThe expert feedback on v1.2 was positive overall.\nEighty-nine percent of the experts judged the checklist to\nbe an appropriate tool for helping to identify factors that\nshould be considered when implementing guideline-based\nCDS. The remaining 11% of experts were not able to judge\nthis or commented on the limitation that the checklist\ndoes not suggest potential solutions for the problems\nidentified or the limitation that the checklist does not\naddress the implementability of guidelines. The experts\nagreed that the checklist would be applicable across differ-\nent settings and different types of practices (82%). The\nremaining experts were uncertain as to how the checklist\nTable 2 Overview of the GUIDES checklist factors and how to evaluate questions (Continued)\nQuestion Strongly\ndisagree\nDisagree Somewhat\ndisagree\nUndecided Somewhat\nagree\nAgree Strongly\nagree\n4.3 Implementation is stepwise and the improvements\nin the CDS system are continuous\n- Is the implementation of the CDS stepwise?\n- Is a plan in place to collect user feedback and to\nmonitor system usage, performance and outcomes?\n- Are malfunctions and other problems with use of\nthe CDS quickly fixed?\n□ □ □□□□ □\n4.4 Governance of the CDS implementation is\nappropriate\n- Are all the key stakeholders involved in the\nplanning and implementation of the system?\n- Is the CDS initiative governed in an efficient,\nsustainable and equitable way?\n□ □ □□□□ □\nFig. 1 Diagram presenting the four domains that are important for successful implementation of guideline-based CDS.

Implementation Science  (2018) 13:86 Page 6 of 12\nwould perform for the implementation of CDS in small\npractices, in tertiary care and in low- and middle-income\ncountries. The experts found that the checklist was logic-\nally organised in a way that it was easy to understand\n(93%) and that the factors were labelled and explained in\nways that were easy to understand (84%). Twenty-nine\npercent of the experts indicated that they felt that parts of\nthe checklist were too complicated. Sixty-four percent of\nthe experts found that no potentially important factors\nwere missing. The other experts either found that some\ndescriptions were implicit or suggested to discuss various\nconcepts such as equitable implementation of CDS,\npatient involvement or use of CDS on handheld devices.\nEighty-four percent concluded that the checklist did not\ninclude irrelevant factors. Some other experts pointed at\ninterrelations or overlap between the factors. The panel\nnoted that the checklist was suitable for people with a re-\nsearch background (80%). Other experts suggested further\nadjustments or asked data about how well the checklist\nachieves its purpose. Forty-two percent observed that pilot\ntesting would be required to evaluate if the checklist is\nsuitable for use by people who are not researchers. Ninety\npercent of the experts indicated that they intend to use\nthe checklist. Other experts were uncertain, and one\nexpert mentioned not to need the checklist given the per-\nsonal expertise acquired by many CDS implementations.\nAdditional file 1 provides more details from the expert\npanel feedback.\nIn the GUIDES checklist v1.3, we regrouped the\nchecklist to a list of 16 factors and we made other\nadjustments as a response to the expert feedback. We\npresented the checklist once more to the panel, which\napproved it unanimously. Table 1 provides a short over-\nview of the checklist and the full checklist is available in\nAdditional file 3. The response of the expert panel to the\nthree additional worksheets was mixed. Therefore, we\ndecided not to include these with the GUIDES checklist.\nHowever, they are available on request.\nPatients and healthcare consumers strongly agreed\nthat guideline-based CDS is an important quality im-\nprovement intervention (100%) and that the GUIDES\nchecklist is a suitable (75%) and potentially beneficial\ntool (100%). They agreed that there is a need to provide\nCDS on treatment options to both healthcare providers\nand patients (sometimes simultaneously for shared deci-\nsion making). Additional file 2 provides more detailed\nresults for this survey.\nStep 3: Pilot testing the GUIDES checklist\nPilot testing the checklist on a sample of CDS trial re-\nports showed that the participants took 60 – 90 min to\ncomplete the checklist. We noted and adjusted some\nredundancies across the checklist factors. Interrater\nagreement was generally poor, with kappa values lower\nthan 0.60. The raters often found the quality of the\nreporting and information about the trials to be ambigu-\nous or unclear. This led to notable variations between\nthe evaluations. After the initial ratings were completed,\nthe six raters resolved disagreements by discussion. They\nagreed that there was insufficient information to make\njudgements about the quality of a CDS intervention for\nhalf of the trial reports. Another frequent cause of dis-\nagreement related to some raters having overlooked spe-\ncific information available in the trial reports. In other\ninstances, raters made different judgements in relation\nto specific factors. The pilot testing indicated that the\nGUIDES checklist could be applied to a range of differ-\nent settings and could be used to classify all the descrip-\ntive information on interventions and contexts.\nEight healthcare providers and 22 patients participated\nin the focus group interviews. The focus groups yielded\n211 factors potentially affecting CDS success. After com-\nbining related factors, we identified 59 unique factors.\nAll the suggested factors could be classified under the\nGUIDES checklist factors. Half of the suggested factors\nwere related to five checklist items: 1.1 ‘CDS can achieve\nthe planned quality objectives ’, 1.2 ‘The quality of the\npatient data is sufficient ’, 1.4 ‘CDS can be added to the\nexisting workload, workflows and systems ’, 2.2 ‘The\nFig. 2 Screenshot of the electronic version of the GUIDES checklist\nillustrating the domains and factors\nVan de Velde et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:86 Page 7 of 12\ncontent is relevant and accurate ’ and 3.2 ‘The decision\nsupport is well delivered ’. The participants suggested a\nmedian of 17 unique factors during the brainstorm\nphase and 13 additional factors during the structured\nphase when the GUIDES checklist was used. Per focus\ngroup, the participants prioritised a median of eight fac-\ntors that were suggested during the brainstorming phase\nand a median of six factors that were suggested during\nthe structured phase. Overall, ten factors were suggested\nonly during the structured interview phase, out of which\nsix were prioritised.\nThe most important GUIDES checklist factors\nThe panel indicated that all the factors we had included\nwere important and that a failure to consider all of them\ncould potentially cause a CDS intervention to fail. They\nnoted, however, that the level of importance of each factor\nmight vary across circumstances and settings. For example,\n30% of the experts indicated that factors in the CDS imple-\nmentation domain were only sometimes important.\nThe survey of the expert panel showed that they con-\nsidered factor 2.1 ‘The content provides trustworthy\nevidence-based information ’ to be the most important\nfactor. Other factors that scored high were 2.2 ‘The deci-\nsion support is relevant and accurate ’, 1.4 ‘CDS can be\nadded to the existing workload, workflows and systems ’\nand 1.1 ‘CDS can achieve the defined quality objectives ’.\nAdditional file 4 provides more detailed results on the\nimportance related ratings by the expert panel.\nDiscussion\nThe goal of the GUIDES project was to increase the suc-\ncess of guideline-based CDS. By developing a checklist,\nwe aimed to assist those involved with the implementa-\ntion of CDS interventions to consider success factors for\nguideline-based CDS in a structured way. When design-\ning the checklist, our biggest challenge was to make it\ncomprehensive and, at the same time, concise and easy\nto apply. The expert panel agreed that the final checklist\nwould be potentially beneficial to people implementing\nguideline-based CDS across a wide range of settings glo-\nbally. Ninety percent of study participants indicated that\nthey intend to use the checklist.\nRelation to findings from studies in related fields\nWe identified two studies in related fields. Ross et al.\nconducted an overview of reviews focusing on factors af-\nfecting the implementation of e-health in general [ 92].\nThe review did not include any factors beyond those\nfound in the GUIDES checklist. Wu et al. conducted an\ninterdisciplinary systematic review and identified factors\nshaping the success of CDS interventions which are gener-\nalisable across healthcare and non-healthcare fields (for\nexample, defence, finance, aviation and the environment)\n[93]. The seven features they listed correspond closely\nwith the factors included in the GUIDES checklist.\nLimitations and perspectives\nThe checklist may have design shortcomings because it\nhas not been extensively tested with people who are not\nresearchers. While the majority of the panel members\nwas involved with research, more than a third was active\nwith both research and clinical practice or implementa-\ntion work. We plan to evaluate the experiences of users\nin the diverse project settings in which the GUIDES\nchecklist will be used. The electronic GUIDES platform\nwill also help us to collect user feedback systematically.\nA first test case includes the ELMO trial, where GUIDES\nwas used to plan the implementation strategy for CDS\naimed to improve the appropriateness of diagnostic test-\ning [ 94]. We recognise that some checklist users may\nneed training in how to use it, and we encourage people\nto contact us for assistance.\nIn most instances, it is clear why each factor has\nbeen assigned to a particular domain. We recognise\nthat in a few instances factors could be assigned to\nmore than one domain (e.g. the factor ‘The system\ndelivers the decision suppo rt to the right target per-\nson’ has a relation to both the CDS system domain\nand the implementation domain). Some factors are\nalso interrelated, such as ‘Stakeholders and users\naccept CDS ’, which is also affected by factors in the\ncontent, system and implementation domain. Other\npotential limitations of our checklist are that it does\nnot include strategies to mitigate risks for CDS inter-\nventions or to solve problems identified when apply-\ning the checklist. For example, the checklist does not\naddress the requirements for guideline design and\nauthoring to facilitate use of guidelines within CDS\n[95]. We recognise that it would be useful to add in-\nformation on mitigation strategies in future updates\nof the GUIDES checklist. Information on strategies to\nevaluate the success of CDS could also be added in\nan update. Although the checklist provides a compre-\nhensive overview of the factors affecting the success\nof CDS interventions, it does not define the minimum\nrequirements for every factor. How, for example, can\none determine when a CDS intervention is sufficiently\nrelevant and accurate? What amount of decision support\nis appropriate? Providing comprehensive detail is challen-\nging given the large variation in CDS contexts and sys-\ntems, and using the checklist requires careful judgement.\nSimilar limitations have also been identified in other\nchecklist projects for complex interventions [ 96].\nMembers of the expert panel gave broad support\nfor the GUIDES checklist. However, we do not yet\nhave evidence that the use of the GUIDES checklist\nVan de Velde et al. Implementation Science  (2018) 13:86 Page 8 of 12\nwill increase the success of guideline-based CDS\ninterventions.\nWe are currently undertaking a qualitative evidence\nsynthesis of perceptions and experiences on using CDS\nto implement recommendations. We will apply the\nGRADE-CERQual system to assess the confidence that\nwe can have in these findings [ 97].\nHow CDS implementers can use the GUIDES checklist\nW et h i n kt h a tt h eG U I D E Sc h e c k l i s ti sb e s tu s e db ym u l t i -\ndisciplinary teams. Each GUIDES domain is important for\nthe outcomes of a CDS intervention, and we recommend\nconsidering all of them. For each factor, users can indicate\nthe degree to which they think the issue has been ad-\ndressed. When concerns are identified that could negatively\naffect the success of a CDS intervention, we recommend\nthat the multidisciplinary group discusses the importance\nof these concerns and reaches a consensus about what\nfollow-up actions are required. Further instructions are pro-\nvided in the actual checklist (Additional file 1).\nHow researchers can use the GUIDES checklist\nThe checklist may be useful for researchers seeking to\nidentify, examine and synthesise factors potentially af-\nfecting the success of CDS. Our pilot testing with the\nfocus group showed that the checklist could help to\nidentify and classify important factors shaping the suc-\ncess of CDS interventions.\nAppraisals of CDS interventions are difficult when\nreporting is poor. We perceive this as an important reason\nfor the low interrater reliability that we obtained during\nthe pilot testing. Fewer than 30% of the trials, we included\nprovided sufficient details about the contexts in which the\nCDS took place or the strategy used to implement the\nCDS. Approximately 75% of the trials described the CDS\nsystem in sufficient detail, but half did not offer sufficient\ninformation about the advice provided by the CDS system.\nWithout such detail, it was difficult to assess the applic-\nability and transferability of the CDS to other settings or\nto identify the factors that contributed to the success or\nfailure of the CDS interventions [ 98].\nThe STARE-HI reporting standards are a resource for\nimproving the reporting of evaluation studies in health\ninformatics [ 99]. These reporting standards recommend\nthe inclusion of a description of the study context and\ndetails about the informatics system used. We would ad-\nvise to include additional criteria in the STARE-HI stan-\ndards or to develop specific reporting criteria for CDS\ninterventions. The GUIDES checklist may be useful\nwhen considering desirable reporting criteria.\nConclusions\nWe designed the GUIDES checklist to support profes-\nsionals in considering, in a more structured way, the\nfactors that may affect the success of CDS interventions.\nIn addition to CDS implementation teams, the checklist\nmight also support CDS developers, researchers, funders\nand educators. Existing frameworks, evidence and expert\ninput informed the development of the checklist. We\nbelieve that CDS implementers who use the GUIDES\nchecklist will get a deeper and more accurate under-\nstanding of the factors shaping CDS effectiveness and\nthey will less likely overlook important factors.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Expert panel feedback.
