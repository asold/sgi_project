In the opening (divergent) phase, several initial ideas of possible solutions are proposed. These\nare the seeds for the next exploration (emergent) phase in which ideas are modified and combined to create new\nsolutions over a series of iterations. Finally, in the closing (convergent) phase, developed ideas are critically examined,\nassessed, and the process result is synthesized [ 15, 34]. Interactive evolution [ 45] can model collaborative design\nprocesses effectively, and it has been widely applied to design and creative activities like fashion [22, 23, 31, 44], music\ncomposition [3, 17, 18, 52], video games [16, 40] and art in general [24, 25]. However, its application has been limited\nto domains where admissible design solutions could be encoded, randomly generated, mutated, and recombined. For\nexample, it has never been applied to evolve free-form texts that would need advanced operators to maintain semantic\ncoherence in generating the results.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of natural language processing and human-computer\ninteraction. These powerful tools can answer complex questions and perform challenging creative tasks such as writing\nscreenplays and theater scripts [30], solving complex math problems [9], theorem proofing [38], generating code to solve\nspecific tasks [8], generate descriptions from images [7], etc. More interestingly, they can also generate random texts\nfrom high-level instructions, combine two or more texts, and create variations of existing texts—all while maintaining\nsemantic coherence in the generated texts. These functionalities can easily map to the genetic operators at the core of\nmost evolutionary algorithms. Thus, we can use LLMs to implement evolutionary operators that can manage free-form\ntext individuals while also maintaining semantic coherence—something that would be difficult, if not impossible, to\nachieve with traditional representations.\nIn this paper, we present an online collaborative design framework that combines interactive evolution with large\nlanguage models for evolving game design ideas (game concepts ) represented as free-form texts. The online interactive\nevolutionary algorithm shows the ideas to the human designers and collects their feedback; the large language model\nimplements all the operators for the random generation, the recombination (crossover), and the variation (mutation) of\nideas. Our framework is very general in that it can support any design process based on textual information (and could\nbe easily extended to integrate visuals integrating tools like Dall-E 2 [36]); it can use any viable LLM and therefore, it is\nintrinsically multilingual; it can be accessed using any medium that can visualize texts like a webpage [5, 6], a 2D-grid\ndisplayed on screen [1, 51], or any viable messaging platform that supports user polls or other ways to collect users’\nfeedback.\nWe performed a preliminary evaluation of our framework on three creative tasks, the design of a board game, the\ndesign of a video game, and the generation of game ideas during the 2023 Global Game Jam. The evaluation involved\naround 80 users (junior and senior game designers). The goal of the two game design tasks was to simulate a typical\nidea-generation process; accordingly, we set a fixed time limit of four working days for each task. The interactive\nevolutionary algorithm communicated with the human designers using the Telegram messaging platform [28] while\nthe genetic operators were implemented using ChatGPT [35]. Each task was initiated with a design brief [15] that was\nsent to the designers as the first message on a Telegram group. The brief was followed by a series of initial design\nideas (some randomly generated using the LLM, some collected from existing designs) — the opening (divergent) phase\n[15]. Then, over the next four days, users evaluated the design ideas they received using the Telegram poll system; the\nevolutionary algorithm employed the users’ feedback to select, recombine and mutate the existing ideas into new ones\nChatGPT and Other LLMs as Evolutionary Engines for Online Interactive Collaborative Game Design 3\npresented next. Instead, the evaluation performed during the 2023 Global Game Jam was conceived as an open-ended\nbrainstorming activity that lasted less than 24 hours to fit the tight schedule of the event.\nThere are few examples of applications of LLMs to idea generation and creativity in games. For example, Zhu and\nLuo [54] explored a generative approach for design ideation combining a language model and a knowledge based of\nexisting patents to generate new ideas. van Stegeren and Myundefinedliwiec [46] investigated the application of GPT-2\nfor generating dialogues in role-playing games for non-player characters while Värtinen et al. [ 48] applied GPT-2\n[39] and GPT-3 [4] to generate description of quests in the same type of games. Frans [12] presented a framework for\nbuilding Language Model Games whose main mechanic involved players manipulating a language model into behaving\nin a desired manner with a demo game called AI Charades. However, to the best of our knowledge, our framework is\nthe first example of interactive evolutionary algorithm that apply large language models to implement genetic operator\nand combines them with interactive evolution to mimic a full-fledged design session from start to end.\n2 RELATED WORK\nInteractive evolution [45] dates back to Richard Dawkins’s The Blind Watchmaker and Biomorphs [10]. Over the years,\nthis approach has been applied to several creative tasks, for which human evaluation might provide a better (if not the\nonly) alternative to the definition of an objective (or fitness) function to evaluate candidate solution, such as fashion\n[22, 23, 31, 44], ergonomics [2, 49], yacht design [21], visual effects [11, 20], synthetic images [42], music [3, 17, 18, 52],\nvideo games [16, 40] and art in general [24, 25].\nInteractive evolutionary frameworks collect human evaluations either implicitly or explicitly. In the former case,\nthe systems track human actions, sometimes building a model of users’ behavior and deriving an assessment of their\npreferences [19, 53]. Galactic Arms Race (GAR) [16] is an example of implicit evaluation. It was the first video game\nusing interactive evolution for content generation; it included a weapon system that automatically evolved new weapons\nbased on players’ behavior. Petalz [40] was a Facebook game about growing a garden of procedurally generated flowers;\nplayers would select what flowers they liked most and wanted to breed; human evaluation used by the interactive\nevolutionary algorithm was implicitly implemented within the farming mechanics.\nMost often, interactive evolutionary frameworks involve an explicit human-based evaluation of candidates and,\nsimilarly to Dawkins’Biomorphs [10], have a grid-like interface that allows users to evaluate candidate designs iteratively.\nHoover et al. [17, 18] integrated interactive evolution with functional scaffolding for generating drum tracks [17] and\naccompaniments for existing musical pieces [ 18] using a compositional pattern-producing network. At first, users\nselect a musical piece (in MIDI format) and which parts should be elaborated by the evolutionary algorithm (e.g.,\nthe piano, guitar, or bass guitar). Next, users customize and refine the computer-generated accompaniment through\nan interactive selection and mutation of compositional networks. Noticeably, the user interface in [18] is similar to\nother music composition tools instead of the grid-based structure used in most frameworks. Cardamone et al. [5, 6]\ndeveloped a tool that combined an interactive genetic algorithm with procedural content generation to evolve tracks\nfor two open-source racing games. The tool had a web frontend that remained active for several years and currently\nappears to be discontinued, although still online. Ølsted et al. [ 55] developed a tool for the interactive evolution of\nfirst-person-shooter maps inspired by the popular multiplayer game Counter-Strike. While the tool of [5, 6] is external\nto the actual racing games, the tool of Ølsted et al. [ 55] is integrated within the game (FPSEvolver) and operated\nlive, collecting players’ feedback during the usual map voting and selection process—a typical phase in multiplayer\nfirst-person-shooter games. Pirovano et al. [37] developed a tool for creating 3D sword models that combined procedural\ncontent generation, interactive evolution, and a grid-based interface to let users explore such a peculiar design space.\n4 Pier Luca Lanzi and Daniele Loiacono\nFig. 1. The framework architecture when collaboration is based on the Telegram messaging platform.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [14] represented a milestone in procedural content generation and have been\napplied to various creative tasks. They learn the probability distribution that generates a collection of training examples\nand can generate more samples from randomly generated input vectors of Gaussian noise, which form the latent space.\nSeveral authors developed methods to explore the latent space to guide the generation of examples [13, 47], including\ninteractive evolution [1, 41]. Bontrager et al. [1] combined generative adversarial networks for image generation with\ninteractive evolution to explore the latent space to improve the quality of sampled images for specific targets. Schrum\net al. [41] applied interactive evolution for exploring the latent space for generating levels for the video games Super\nMario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda . Both [1] and [41] require an explicit human-based evaluation using a grid-like\ninterface similar to the ones used in [5, 6, 10, 37].\nChatGPT and Other LLMs as Evolutionary Engines for Online Interactive Collaborative Game Design 5\n3 THE FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE\nOur framework combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human game design\nprocess. It comprises three components: (i) the online database of game design ideas; (ii) the evolutionary algorithm;\nand (iii) the agent responsible for publishing the designs and collecting users’ feedback. Figure 1 shows the structure of\nour framework; in this case, the interaction with the human designers uses the Telegram messaging system, which is\nthe one we employed in the experiments discussed in this study.\nThe databasecontains (i) a list of game design ideas that have been published and are currently under evaluation; (ii)\nthe list of submitted evaluations that are used to compute the fitness; (iii) the current population of active design ideas;\nthis includes both the designs that been already published and under evaluation by the users and the ones that have\nbeen already generated but not published yet.\nThe evolutionary engineis implemented as a steady-state genetic algorithm that, at each iteration, (i) selects promising\ngame design ideas from the current population; (ii) applies recombination and mutation (implemented using a large\nlanguage model like ChatGPT or another LLM like DaVinci GPT-3 [4]); (iii) inserts the newly generated individuals in\nthe population; finally, (iv) deletes individuals to keep the population size constant.\nThe interaction agentmanages the communication between the framework and the publishing server; it publishes\nthe design concepts in the population and collects the users’ feedback. In Figure 1, we show the architecture used in the\nexperiments discussed in this paper with an interaction agent implemented as a Telegram bot that publishes the design\nconcepts on a Telegram group through the Telegram servers. However, our framework also supports publishing using\nweb servers (as done in [6, 42]).\nNote that, when using a publishing-subscribe platform like Telegram, the publication of design concepts is timed to\nlimit the number of concepts (and message notifications) the users receive at any given time (see Section 5). Accordingly,\nwe maintain two separate tables, one for the population of active designs (Figure 1) and one for the published designs\ncurrently being evaluated. In contrast, when interacting through a web server, the agent will publish the population all\nat once; users will autonomously decide how many concepts they want to view and evaluate using the online navigation\ninterface (similarly to [6, 42]).\nUser Evaluation.Most of the interactive evolutionary algorithms we examined (Section 2) ask for qualitative eval-\nuations based, for example, on basic voting systems [ 41, 55], scales with a limited number of values [ 5, 6], or let\nusers actively select what individual should go to the next generation [1, 51]. In our framework, we adopted a simple\nthree-value scale (positive, neutral, and negative) that let users express how they felt about a given design idea. Note\nthat, the evaluation is anonymous and users cannot see how other people evaluated an idea before they submitted their\nevaluation. When using the Telegram poll-based interface, only the summary statistics about the submitted evaluations\nwill appear on the group chat; when using the web-based interface, users can see only their evaluation.\n3.1 The Workflow\nThe process starts with a short design brief , describing the activity goals [50]. The evolutionary algorithm uses the brief\nto generate the initial population either (i) by asking ChatGPT or another language model to generate random solutions\n(similarly to the traditional population initialization in evolutionary algorithms); (ii) by introducing human-designed\nconcepts originating from the brief (e.g., by asking participants to propose solutions or taking existing well-known\nsolutions); or (iii) by combining the previous options (similarly to the half and half initialization in Genetic Programming\n6 Pier Luca Lanzi and Daniele Loiacono\n[26]). The individuals in the initial population are published either at once (when collaboration is web-based) or timely\n(when using a publishing-subscribe platform like Telegram). Next, the framework waits for feedback from the users,\nwho can score each published concept. When sufficient evaluations have been submitted for all the published concepts,\nthe evolutionary algorithm starts its select-recombine-mutate cycle: it selects two individuals from the population\nusing tournament selection of size two; with a given probability, it applies recombination to generate one offspring\nthat is then mutated; finally, the offspring is added to the population while the worst individual is deleted to keep the\npopulation size constant. The new individual becomes eligible for publication; depending on the platform used, the\nindividual is published immediately or in a given time frame. The next iteration of the evolutionary algorithm will start\nwhen a sufficient number of evaluations have been submitted for the newly published individuals.\n4 IMPLEMENTING GENETIC OPERATORS WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS\nLLMs are queried using questions (i.e., prompts) expressed in natural language. The quality of their answers heavily\nrelies on how well the prompts can specify the objective for the target LLM. In our framework, individuals represent\ngame design ideas expressed as free-form text; all the operators manipulating them are implemented by querying an\nLLM. Accordingly, we initially studied how to design prompts so that the LLM answers could mimic the behavior of the\nthree operators we needed to implement the evolutionary algorithm: random initialization of individuals, recombination\nor crossover, and variation or mutation.\n4.1 Random Initialization of Individual\nIn our framework, the population can be initialized (i) with random individuals, (ii) with existing designs, or (iii) with a\ncombination of the previous approaches. Random individuals (game ideas) ignite the design process and need to provide\nan approximate indication of the target objective. In our initial analysis of feasible prompts to implement evolutionary\noperators we noted that it is convenient to ask the system to structure the answer. Accordingly, the prompts used\nto generate the initial random game ideas consist of (i) a design brief defining the objective and its constraints in an\norganized structure; and (ii) a request to act as a game designer and generate a novel design based on the brief. Table 1a\nshows a prompt to generate a random idea for a generic board game. The bold text shows the actual request while the\nremaining part specifies how the answer should be structured. Note that, the prompt also specifies the length of each\nsection to avoid very long game ideas that could be more difficult to evaluate by the designers. When the request is less\ngeneric, the prompt begins with a text that serves as inspiration or as an example of the objective. Table 1b shows a\nprompt to generate a video game that uses a minimal amount of resources. This example is inspired to the study of\nminimalism in video game design [32, 33]. The first sentence of the prompt is a statement that serves as an inspiration\nand sets the basis of what is going to be asked. The second sentence (in bold) shows the actual request (as in the previous\ncase). The remaining text specifies the answer structure. Table 1c shows an example of prompt that was used to generate\nrandom individuals for an experiment run during the 2023 Global Game Jam1 in which the goal was to create a game\nbased on the theme roots. Also in this case, the first sentence was used as a sort of inspiration. However, since there\ncould be many interpretations of roots (it could refer to cultural heritage, botanic, etc.), the sentence contained the\nmarker ⟨𝐼𝑁𝑇𝐸𝑅𝑃𝑅𝐸𝑇𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩which was replaced with sentences suggesting different interpretations (Table 1d). The\nprocess generated a great variety of prompts for the same theme.\n1https://globalgamejam.org\nChatGPT and Other LLMs as Evolutionary Engines for Online Interactive Collaborative Game Design 7\nAct as a board game designer and create a unique board game with the following restrictions:the game can involve only a board\n(of any layot) and a set of pieces (of any number, and type). Organize your response as follows: 1) Name of the Game; 2) Number of\nplayers and cooperative/competitive game; 3) Game Board: describe the layout of the game board, the number and shape of its tiles (max\n200 characters); 4) Game Pieces: describe the number of pieces, their type, and their distribution among players (max 300 characters); 5)\nRules: provide a detailed explanation of how the game is played, including how to move pieces and take turns (max 800 characters); 6)\nObjective: provide a clear description of the win and lose conditions of the game (max 200 characters). Keep the game description as\nsimple as possible, without including visual details, theme and story.\n(a)\nA white pixel is the minimum amount of information we can show on-screen, and pressing a key (or a button) is the least interaction we\ncan ask players. Act as a game designer and design a minimalist game.Organize your response as follows: 1) the name of the game;\n2) game concept: describe the idea, the core mechanics, the goal of the game, and player controls (max 1000 chars); 3) game resources:\ndescribe the graphical elements involved by the game, which type of player input is required, and any additional resources required by the\ngame (e.g., sound); 4) level design: describe how to do the level design for this game (max 300 chars); 5) game instructions: provide the\ngame instructions for the player (max 300 chars). Do not add additional information.\n(b)\nAct as a game designer and describe (max 1000 chars), a concept for a video game about the theme \"roots:\n⟨𝐼𝑁𝑇𝐸𝑅𝑃𝑅𝐸𝑇𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩\". Both the game mechanics and the interaction of the players with the game should involve elements di-\nrectly connected to the theme of the game.\nOrganize your response as follows: 1) name of the game; 2) game concept: describe the idea, the core mechanics, the goal of the game, and\nplayer controls (max 800 chars); 3) level design: describe how to do the level design for this game (max 400 chars); 4) game instructions:\nprovide the game instructions for the player (max 300 chars).

In\nyour response do not include any introduction or final comment. In the response, please avoid explicit reference to the original game.\n(f)\nTable 1. Example of prompts for generating (a) a generic board game; (b) a minimalistic video game; (c) a game based on the theme\nroots in which the marker ⟨𝐼𝑁𝑇𝐸𝑅𝑃𝑅𝐸𝑇𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩can be replaced with sentences suggesting different theme interpretation, like the\nones listed in (d). Prompts to implement (e) recombination (crossover) and (f) variation (mutation); ⟨𝐵𝑅𝐼𝐸𝐹 ⟩identify the brief used\nto generate the random individuals, ⟨𝐼𝑁𝐷𝐼𝑉𝐼𝐷𝑈𝐴𝐿 ⟩an individual selected from the population, and ⟨𝑀𝑈𝑇𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩a high-level\ncharacteristic of gameplay.\n8 Pier Luca Lanzi and Daniele Loiacono\n4.2 Recombination (Crossover)\nThe prompt to implement the recombination of two individuals has a general structure (Table 1e). It starts with the\nsame brief used to generate random individuals. For example, when recombining two video games using minimal\nresources, the marker ⟨𝐵𝑅𝐼𝐸𝐹 ⟩would be replaced with the sentence “A white pixel is the minimum amount [...]” from\nTable 1b. The brief is followed by two examples of games in which the markers ⟨𝐼𝑁𝐷𝐼𝑉𝐼𝐷𝑈𝐴𝐿 ⟩are replaced with the\ntext description of the two parents selected for recombination. Next, the actual request (highlighted in bold) and two\nsentences specifying a series of constraints to avoid answers that are blunt rephrasing of the parents. Note that, the\nrecombination prompt generates one single offspring and to generate a second offspring (as in traditional crossover)\nanother prompt using two different parents should be used. We tried several prompts to generate two offspring at once\nbut we noted that such approach would lead with very similar offspring so we opted for a recombination prompt that\nwould generate only one offspring.\n4.3 Variation (Mutation)\nThe prompt for variation also starts with the brief used to generate random individuals (marker ⟨𝐵𝑅𝐼𝐸𝐹 ⟩in Table 1f)\nfollowed by (i) an existing game idea to be mutated (marker ⟨𝐼𝑁𝐷𝐼𝑉𝐼𝐷𝑈𝐴𝐿 ⟩), (ii) the request to the LLM (highlighted\nin bold) specifying the focus of the mutation (marker ⟨𝑀𝑈𝑇𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩), and (iv) two sentences specifying a series of\nconstraints to avoid answers that would be simple rephrasing of the parent. Marker ⟨𝑀𝑈𝑇𝐴𝑇𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩specifies the focus\nof the mutation and it is randomly replaced with a gameplay aspects such as, the goal of the game , the game’s resources ,\nthe level design , the player’s input , etc. We experimented with mutation operators that would work at a lower level\nof detail (e.g., by substituting some keywords of the game idea with synonyms or antonyms generated using word\nembeddings); however, the approach proved less effective as it did not introduce enough variation.\n5 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\nWe performed a preliminary evaluation of our framework with human subjects (junior and senior game designers) on\nthree design tasks. One focused on designing a video game with the least amount of resources possible while having\ninteresting mechanics—a minimalistic video game [32, 33]. One concerned the creation of a generic board game using\nonly one board of any layout and a set of pieces. Finally, we evaluated our framework with people participating in the\n2023 Global Game Jam as a tool for the initial brainstorming phase of the jam. All the experiments were run using the\nTelegram-based version of our framework (Figure 1).\n5.1 Board Game and Minimalistic Video Game Design\nThese two experiments were aimed at simulating the typical idea-generation process in a controlled environment\n(e.g., a design studio) that usually is well-structured [ 15], has clear goals, and has a fixed duration. We set up two\nTelegram groups, one for each task. We sent a call for volunteers to game designer communities on Facebook and\nmailing lists, providing a link for joining each Telegram group. In total, 44 individuals joined one or both groups,\nwith 35 actively engaging in the experiments. Among these participants, 23 were involved in both experiments, while\n8 participated exclusively in the video game task, and 4 in the board game task. Not all participants disclosed their\nidentities, limiting our ability to provide comprehensive demographic data. In response to concerns regarding the\navailability for continuous feedback throughout the day, we scheduled the publication of design ideas during three\ndistinct periods: morning, noon, and late afternoon. The experiments began with a brief that we posted on each Telegram\nChatGPT and Other LLMs as Evolutionary Engines for Online Interactive Collaborative Game Design 9\ngroup with information about the timing of the postings so that people could plan their participation. The participants\nwere not informed about the evolutionary algorithm that was running in the background and about the use of large\nlanguage models. Instead, we informed them that AI will be used to support the design process based on their feedback.\nThe experiments lasted four days, Tuesday to Friday; we allowed a grace period of a few hours, until Saturday morning,\nto let participants submit their final evaluations. We wanted to focus the design process and limit the number of ideas\nthat the participants had to evaluate initially (Section 3). Accordingly, we chose a small population size (10 individuals);\nselection, recombination, and variation were implemented using ChatGPT [ 35]; they were triggered as soon as 25\nnew evaluations were submitted; selection was implemented using a tournament selection of size 2; recombination\nprobability was set to 0.7; variation was always applied.\nOver the four days, the evolutionary algorithm performed 30 iterations and a total of 40 game ideas were evaluated\nfor each task; board game ideas received a total of 799 evaluations; video game ideas received 1025 evaluations overall.\nFigure 2 shows the number of evaluations submitted over the four and half days. The plots follow the schedule with\npeaks around the publication slots and no evaluations during the night time. Figure 3 shows the average length of the\nconcepts (as the number of characters) in the population computed as the moving average over the last 5 activations of\nthe evolutionary algorithm. As can be noted, board game concepts tend to be longer on average (Figure 3) and therefore\nrequire more effort to evaluate; as a consequence, the board game concepts received fewer evaluations than the ones of\nminimalistic video games as Figure 2 shows.\nFigure 4 compares the word cloud generated using all the board game ideas in the original population (4a) with the\none generated from the final population (4b). The clouds share some general terms (e.g., moves, starts), but the game\nconcepts in the final population focus on completely different concepts like the terms related to ecosystem maintenance\n(e.g., island, conservation, resources). Due to lack of space, we cannot report the word clouds for the video game task as\nwell as examples of game concepts generated (we refer the reader to [27] for additional details).\nFinally, we asked participants to complete a form with four open questions. The questions and a summary of the\nparticipants’ opinions, based on 10 responses collected for the board game task and 13 for the video game task, are\npresented below.\n(i) Which game concepts did they like most, and why?Many games in the final population shared similar elements\nand mechanics. Although participants did not prefer a single game over the 40 evaluated, there was a common preference\nfor concepts that involved one specific mechanic for each task. For the board game design task, most participants liked\na cooperative mechanic that asked players to maintain the equilibrium of an ecosystem by placing tiles on a board.\nInterestingly, no elements of this mechanic were present in the initial population but the mechanic emerged later in the\nexperiment in games with different narratives (e.g., one set in an island environment, one in an urban environment).\nIn the video game task, most participants liked a game mechanic involving reflection in its different interpretations\n(e.g., reflection of light in some games, reflection of bouncing bullets in other ones). In this case, the initial population\ncontained one game description using reflection of bullets however the light reflection mechanics appeared much later\nin the population.\n(ii) What were the positive features of the generated concepts?Participants mainly liked the emergence of\nnovelty in mechanics, player inputs, and unexpected element combinations. For instance, in the video game task, a\nnovel mechanic involving color manipulation combined with shadow and light mechanics positively impressed some\nparticipants. Additionally, the emergence of different narratives (e.g., environmental protection, urban planning) and\nscenarios (e.g., a jungle, an island, etc.) in the board game task was positively received.\n10 Pier Luca Lanzi and Daniele Loiacono\nFig. 2.

Word cloud for (a) the initial population and (b) the final population of the board game design task.\n(iii) What were the negative features of the generated concepts?The two main issues reported were the degree\nof similarity and incoherence in some generated concepts. The similarity issue resulted from the small population\nsize (10 individuals) and a limited number of steady-state iterations (30), which increased the likelihood of presenting\nseveral vations of the same concept. However, this design choice was necessary to reduce the evaluation burden. The\n12 Pier Luca Lanzi and Daniele Loiacono\nincoherence issue stemmed from the current limitations of LLMs [29, 43]. Despite we might expect future improvements\nin this respect, the lack of coherence is a common problem in these models and it is not easy to solve.\n(iv) How could the collaborative design experience be improved?Interestingly, most participants did not suggest\nincreasing their agency but rather improving concept presentation. Some participants recommended presenting concepts\nmore visually (e.g., using images or videos), while others suggested highlighting similarities and differences among the\nconcepts to facilitate evaluation.\n5.2 2023 Global Game Jam\nWe performed a final experiment during the 2023 Global Game Jam that ran February 3-5, 2023, from Friday afternoon\nto Sunday evening. The event always starts at 5 pm on Friday with the publication of the theme (this year was roots)\nand ends Sunday evening with the presentation of the games. The jam is a global event run with a local timing in that it\nstarts at 5 pm and ends Sunday around 6 pmin every time zone ; jam sites in the Asia continent are the first to start, those\nin the Hawaiian time zone are the last ones. We contacted organizers of the Global Game Jam sites in our country, sent\nthem a link to a dedicated Telegram group, and asked them to advertise the tool’s availability to the participants of their\njam sites; around 35 people joined the group, most of them anonymously. In the previous experiments, at the beginning,\nparticipants received a brief with a list of constraints and were instructed to cooperate toward a common objective.\nIn contrast, in this case, participants had a theme (roots) that could lead to several different interpretations; they did\nnot have constraints and did not have to collaborate but they brainstormed for ideas to develop their own game. In\naddition, the time window was more limited since the game must be implemented by Sunday afternoon, so teams need\nto come up with a game idea by Saturday around noon or early afternoon at the latest. When the theme was revealed\non February 3 at 5 pm, we published the first ten game ideas randomly generated using the procedure discussed in\nSection 4; the framework remained online until Saturday night. The evolutionary operators were implemented using\nDaVinci GPT-3 [4]; the selection was triggered every 5 new evaluations; recombination and mutation probabilities\nwere set as in the previous experiments. The evolutionary algorithm ran for 15 iterations with a number of evaluations\nmuch lower than what was recorded in the previous experiments. This is probably due to the short span that jammers\ncan dedicate to the brainstorming process and the in-person nature of the event. Global Game Jam is a physical jam\nthat encourages meeting, working, and sharing ideas with new people. Thus, it is no surprise that an online framework\nlike ours did not fit well in this in-person scenario.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nWe presented an online collaborative design framework combining interactive evolution and large language models for\nhelping users evolve design ideas represented as free-form text. Our framework can support collaboration through\ntraditional web-based grid interfaces [6, 42] as well as messaging systems, like Telegram, which in our opinion might fit\nfree-text content better. We evaluated our framework in three scenarios involving around 80 participants. Two scenarios\nmimicked the typical collaborative design process with objectives specified at the start and a fixed duration. The third\none was conceived as an open-ended brainstorming activity that took place during the 2023 Global Game Jam. The first\ntwo used an evolutionary engine based on ChatGPT; the third one employed DaVinci GPT-3 for the same purpose. All\nthe experiments were run using the Telegram-based interface of our framework. Overall, we received positive feedback\nfrom the participants. In our experience, we did not notice any difference between the two large language models that\nare, in our opinion, both viable options. We focused our evaluation on game design since we had access to several\nChatGPT and Other LLMs as Evolutionary Engines for Online Interactive Collaborative Game Design 13\njunior and senior game designers employed in the industry. However, the framework can be applied to any design task\nwhich can be described in free-text form. And if needed, it could be easily extended with text-to-image platforms (like\nDall·E 2[36] or Midjourney2) to enrich design ideas with captivating visuals.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Philip Bontrager, Wending Lin, Julian Togelius, and Sebastian Risi. 2018.

Cooperative/competitive game: Cooperative.\nGame Board: a square board with 64 tiles in an 8x8 grid, representing a tropical island. Each tile has a different terrain,\nsuch as a beach, a rainforest, a volcano, a coral reef and a mangrove. The board also includes a starting point and a research\nstation tile.\nGame Pieces: Each player starts with a pawn-shaped game piece, representing their scientist and a set of worker\npieces, which are small circles. The players also have a set of cards representing different research equipment, such as a\nmicroscope, a GPS, a sample container and a camera, and different conservation measures, such as marine protected areas,\nreforestation and community education.\nRules:\nPlayers take turns moving their game pieces on the board, starting from the starting point and trying to reach the\nresearch station tile. Each tile has its own set of environmental issues, such as habitat destruction, pollution, and\noverfishing. Landing on a tile can either help or harm the player’s research. Players can use their cards to study\nand mitigate the issues and increase their chances of reaching the research station. Players can also place their\nconservation measures on any tile, but they have to abide by certain rules such as: Marine protected areas need to be\nplaced near coral reefs to protect them; Reforestation needs to be placed in areas with high soil erosion; Community\neducation needs to be placed near vulnerable communities; Players also have a limited number of workers, they\ncan place on the board to help them implement conservation measures faster. Players can also form alliances with\nother players to increase their chances of reaching the research station, but they can also betray their allies to gain\nan advantage. Players can also choose to remove their conservation measures to make room for new measures. The\ngame ends when one player reaches the research station tile or all the tiles on the board are filled with conservation measures.\nObjective: The game is won by the player who reaches the research station tile first and has implemented conservation\nmeasures that meet certain criteria for biodiversity and sustainability. The players lose if the island becomes unsustainable\nor all players run out of cards before reaching the research station tile.\n(a)\nName of the game: Fortress Siege\nNumber of players: 2-4. Cooperative/competitive game: Competitive.\nGame Board: a rectangular board with 36 tiles in a 6x6 grid. The board is divided into two sections, one for each player’s\nfortress. The fortresses are separated by a neutral zone of 4 tiles.\nGame Pieces: Each player starts with 8 game pieces, consisting of: 1 King piece (larger than others and unique in shape),2\nKnight pieces (shaped like horses), 2 Archer pieces (shaped like bows), and 3 Peasant pieces (shaped like small houses).\nRules:\nPlayers take turns moving their pieces one tile at a time within their own fortress. They can move their pieces to any\ntile within their fortress, except for the king piece which can only move to 1 tile per turn. The goal of the game is to\nmove the king piece to the opponent’s fortress while protecting it from enemy pieces. The Knight pieces can move and\ncapture any enemy piece in the adjacent tiles. The Archer pieces can capture any enemy piece in a straight line up to\n2 tiles away, and Peasants can capture any enemy piece in an adjacent tile. Each turn, players can either move one of\ntheir pieces or capture an opponent’s piece with one of their pieces. A player can move any of their pieces, but can only\ncapture an opponent’s piece with a piece of the same type. The player who captures the opponent’s king piece wins the game.\nObjective: Objective: The game ends when one player successfully captures the opponent’s king piece. That player wins,\nand the other players lose.\n(b)\nTable 2.
