INTRODUCTION\nAs the most mature renewable energy source (RES), more\nthan 500 GW of capacity has been installed until year 2019.\nMost of the capacity is onshore wind power. However, with\nthe increasing development, the onshore wind power capacity\nwould reach its limit.

Offshore wind farm grid-connection scheme through\nconventional HVDC.\nthe offshore wind energy source [1]. Generally, there are\nmainly two types of grid-connection schemes for offshore\nwind farm: i.e., high voltage alternative current (HV AC)\nsystem and high voltage direct current (HVDC) system.\nIf the offshore wind farm is not far from mainland, HV AC\nbased grid-connection scheme is better. Permanent magnet\nsynchronous generator (PMSG) is taken as an example, the\ncircuit topology consists of full-scale AC/DC/AC converter,\nmedium-voltage fundamental-frequency transformers and\nhigh-voltage fundamental-frequency transformer, as shown\nin Fig.1. As for offshore wind farms located far away from\nmainland, the DC scheme would be more suitable, because\nthe capacitance effect of the AC cable has more signiﬁ-\ncant impact on the power transmission with the distance\nincreasing. Generally, 50km offshore distance is regarded as\na threshold. If offshore wind farms locate more than 50km\naway from the mainland, HVDC scheme seems to be the only\noption [2], [4]–[6].\nThere are two typical types of HVDC systems, i.e.,\nline commutated converter (LCC) based HVDC and volt-\nage source converter (VSC) based HVDC. Speciﬁcally,\nthe modular multilevel converter (MMC) based HVDC\nis becoming the most popular topology out of the VSC\nbased HVDC systems [7]–[13]. The topologies of the two\nschemes are illustrated in Fig.2, where the LCC based HVDC\nrequires an extra stationary static synchronous compensators\n(STATCOM) used to regulate the AC bus voltage on the\noffshore side. As well, there are many stages in the DC\nscheme, including full-scale AC/DC/AC converter, medium-\nvoltage fundamental-frequency transformers, high-voltage\nfundamental-frequency transformer, high-voltage DC/AC\nconverter and STATCOM (only in LCC based HVDC).\nCompared with the LCC based HVDC, the VSC based\nHVDC has several advantages: (1) reduced devices and foot-\nprint, which is very suitable for the offshore application;\nFIGURE 3. Serial-connection voltage step-up scheme for offshore wind\nfarm.\nFIGURE 4. Two-stage DC voltage step-up topology for offshore wind farm.\n(2) active and reactive power decoupled control characteris-\ntics. However, although the VSC based HVDC seems suitable\nfor offshore wind farm integration, it still has the following\ndrawbacks:\n(1) Many power conversion stages are included in the\nsystem, which lowers overall efﬁciency and reliability of the\nsystem.\n(2) Bulky fundamental-frequency transformers are used in\nthe medium voltage AC (MV AC) system for wind energy\ncollection. Unlike the onshore wind farm, offshore devices\nincluding transformers have to be placed on custom-built\noffshore platforms, which would be very expensive with large\nfootprint.\nHence, to address these issues and improve the efﬁciency\nand economical performance, some new approaches for the\noffshore wind farm integration have been investigated. Some\nscholars proposed to use different types of HVDC converters\nfor the grid-connecting of offshore wind farms, and their\ncontrol strategies were studied as well. Diode rectiﬁer, LCC,\ntwo-level VSC, MMC and their mixed structures have been\nstudied in [2], [14]–[18]. These topologies all need to use the\nMV AC system to collect the electrical power, which means\nthat the medium-voltage transformer is always needed. In\naddition, the MV AC system has large loss when it is used\nfor offshore wind power farms. To resolve the issues caused\nby the MV AC system, offshore DC system was investigated\nby many scholars recently. In terms of the DC voltage step-\nup methods, there are mainly two categories: (1) boost the\nDC voltage through serial connecting wind turbines (see\nFig.3) [19]–[23]; (2) utilize the step-up DC/DC converter\n(see Fig.4) [24]. Although the wind turbine serial-connection\nVOLUME 8, 2020 15737\nP. Huet al.: MMDC Transformer-Based DC Transmission System for PMSG-Based Offshore Wind Farm Integration\nFIGURE 5. The proposed modular multiple DC/DC transformer based\noffshore DC system.\nvoltage step-up scheme looks simpler, the insulation for the\ntop wind turbine is a big challenge. On the other hand,\nthe step-up DC/DC converter based DC offshore wind farm\nis more realistic and has been paid much attention. Refer-\nence [25] investigated different control strategies of the DC\noffshore wind farms with the step-up DC/DC converters.\nReference [26] applied fuzzy logic control to the DC offshore\nwind farm, which still has many conversion stages. To further\nreduce the conversion stages and footprint of the offshore\nDC system, this paper proposes a novel modular multi-\nple DC/DC transformer based offshore DC system, shown\nin Fig.5, which utilizes only one stage DC step-up converter.\nThe overall efﬁciency and volume could be reduced. In this\npaper, the PMSG based offshore wind farm is taken into\nconsideration. Additionally, this paper also introduces control\nstrategy of the proposed system, which could realize both\nthe voltage and current balance of the submodules of the\nMMDC and the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of\nthe PMSG. Finally, a 160 DC/DC submodules based MMDC\nsimulation model constructed in PSCAD/EMTDC, and a\n9 DC/DC submodules based MMDC laboratory prototype are\npresented in this paper.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follow: Section II\npresents the conﬁguration and operating principles of the sys-\ntem; the control strategy is proposed in section III; simulation\nveriﬁcation is presented in section IV; downscaled prototype\nof the system and the experimental results are presented in\nsection V; conclusions are drawn in section VI.\nII. CONFIGURATION AND OPERATING PRINCIPLES\nA. CONFIGURATION OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\nThe proposed Modular Multiple DC (MMDC) transformer\nbased DC transmission system for PMSG based offshore\nwind farm integration is shown in Fig.5 (a), which con-\nsists of one or several offshore wind power generation units\n(WPGU), an onshore modular multilevel converter (MMC),\nHVDC bus and cables. Each WPGU comprises one or several\nPMSGs (each comprising a diode rectiﬁer), a medium voltage\nDC (MVDC) bus and an MMDC transformer, as shown\nin Fig.5 (b). As the key equipment of the proposed sys-\ntem, the MMDC transformer comprises several input-series\noutput-parallel (ISOP) DC conversion groups, each of which\nconsists of several input-series output-series (ISOS) DC/DC\nconverter submodules, as shown in Fig.5 (c). The multi-\nple series and parallel connection conﬁguration increases\nthe withstanding voltage and ﬂowing-through current of\nthe MMDC transformer, making it suitable for high-voltage\nand high-power applications, such as offshore wind power\nintegration.\nB. TOPOLOGY SELECTION OF MODULAR\nDC/DC CONVERTER\nFor the PMSG and diode rectiﬁer based offshore wind farm\nintegration application, the main features are high voltage and\nhigh power, unidirectional power transfer and output voltage\nvariation. Therefore, the DC/DC submodule needs to satisfy\nthe following requirements: (1) galvanic isolation between\nthe low-voltage and high-voltage sides; (2) wide input voltage\nrange, because output voltage of the diode-rectiﬁer varies\nalong with the input wind power; (3) undirectional power\ntransfer of the DC/DC converter for the sake of economic per-\nformance. Thus, three topologies are selected as candidates,\nwhich are single active bridge (SAB) converter [27], LLC\nresonant converter [28] and LCC resonant converter [29].\nAmong the three types of converters, SAB converter and LCC\nconverter have relatively high efﬁciency in the conventional\noffshore DC wind farm system. The LLC resonant converter\n15738 VOLUME 8, 2020\nP. Huet al.: MMDC Transformer-Based DC Transmission System for PMSG-Based Offshore Wind Farm Integration\nFIGURE 6. Topology of LLC resonant converter.\nFIGURE 7. Sending side of the proposed system.\nhas some signiﬁcant advantages: such as zero-voltage turn-\non and zero-current turn-off, wide input voltage range, high\nefﬁciency under wide power range and so forth [30]–[32].\nSince the PMSGs directly connect to the MVDC bus through\ndiode rectiﬁer, the voltage of the MVDC bus varies according\nto the input power of PMSGs (i.e., the wind speed). Thus,\nthe input voltage of the MMDC has a relatively large voltage\nrange, which makes the LLC resonant converter more suitable\nfor this application.\nThe topology of the LLC resonant converter is shown\nin Fig.6. Operating principles of the LLC resonant con-\nverter have been comprehensively investigated by the litera-\nture [33]–[35]. Thus, details of the LLC operating principles\nwould not be repeated in this paper.\nC. MATHEMATICAL MODEL\nThe sending side of the proposed system is composed of\nPMSG, diode rectiﬁer and MMDC, which is shown in Fig.7\n(one PMSG unit is taken as an example). The mathematical\nrelationship between the wind turbine and the MMDC is\nessential for the design of the control system.\nThe mathematical model of the wind turbine is\nexpressed as\nλ=ωr R/v (1)\nλi = 1\n1/(λ+0.08β) −0.035/(β3 +1) (2)\nCp =0.22(116/λi −0.4β−5)e−12.5/λi (3)\nPm =0.5ρπR2(R\nλ)3Cpω3\nr (4)\nTm =Pm/ωr (5)\nwhere λdenotes the tip speed ratio, ωr denotes the rotational\nspeed of the rotor, R denotes the radius of the blade, βdenotes\nthe pitch angle, Cp denotes the wind-power utilization factor,\nPm denotes the output mechanical power and Tm denotes the\nmechanical torque. Combing eqns. (1) to (4) yields\nPm =kopt ω3\nr (6)\nwhere kopt denotes the optimal coefﬁcient which makes the\nwind turbine generates the maximum power on the conditions\nof various wind speeds. On the other hand, the mathematical\nmodel of the PMSG can be illustrated as\nPG =VinIin (7)\nTe =PG\n/\nωr (8)\nJ dωr\ndt =Tm −Te (9)\nes =npωr ψf (10)\nwhere PG denotes electromagnetic power generated by the\nPMSG, Te denotes electromagnetic torque, J denotes rota-\ntional inertia, es denotes the excitation electromotive force,\nnp denotes pole pairs, and ψf denotes the ﬂux linkage.\nRegarding the synchronous reactance of the PMSG as the\ncommutation reactance of the diode rectiﬁer, the output volt-\nage of the DBC can be obtained as [36]\nVin =6\n√\n3\nπ es −6npωr Ls\nπ Iin (11)\nwhere Ls is the synchronous reactance.\nIgnoring the loss of the PMSG, the output power of the\nPMSG should be equal to the input power, which is\nPG =VinIin =Pm =kopt ω3\nr (12)\nFor the MMDC, the input power (P G), which is generated\nby the maximum power point track (MPPT) strategy should\nbe equally shared by each submodule. Thus, given that the\nMMDC consists of k submodule groups, and each group\nconsists of n submodules, the input power of each submodule\ncan be calculated by\nPin_ij =NwPG/(kn) (13)\nwhere Nw denotes the PMSG count in a WPGU. Combing\neqns. (10), (12) and (13) yields\nPin_ij = Nwkopt\nnkn3pψ3\nf\ne3\ns (14)\nAdditionally, combing eqns. (10), (11) and (12) yields\nVin =1\n2(A +\n√\nA2 −4Be2s )es (15)\nwhere A =6\n√\n3\nπ , B =6kopt Ls\nπn3pψ4\nf\n. Thus, the input voltage of the\njth submodule in the ith group can be written as\nVin_ij = 1\n2n(A +\n√\nA2 −4Be2s )es (16)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 15739\nP. Huet al.: MMDC Transformer-Based DC Transmission System for PMSG-Based Offshore Wind Farm Integration\nTABLE 1. Economical efficiency comparison.\nHence, according to eqns. (13) and (16), the input voltage\nand power of the LLC submodule are dependent on the\nexcitation electromotive force (e s).\nD. COST ANALYSIS\nTo clarify the economical efﬁciency of the proposed topol-\nogy, two other feasible solutions (presented in Figure 2 and\nFigure 4) are used to compare with the proposed topology. For\nthe sake of simplicity, the topologies shown in Figure 2 and\nFigure 4 are named topology 1 and topology 2, respectively.\nSince many different AC/DC and DC/DC topologies could\nbe employed, it is difﬁcult to comprehensively compare the\npower switch count and corresponding loss. Capacity of each\nwind turbine is supposed as S, and the total number of wind\nturbines is selected as n. It is worth mentioning that the\nAC/DC/AC converter in topology 1 is regarded as a AC/DC\nconverter plus a DC/AC converter. Thus, the power capacity\nof converter is employed as the surrogate index. Other aspects\nincluding the fundamental frequency transformer, medium\nfrequency transformer and offshore platform are disscussed\nas well. The detailed comparison results are depicted in\nTable 1, where it can be seen that the proposed topology\nonly has nS power capacity of converters and does not need\noffshore platform. It can be concluded that the economical\nefﬁciency of the proposed topology is better than other two\ntopologies.\nIII. CONTROL SYSTEM\nA. OPERATING CURVE OF THE LLC SUBMODULE\nSince the LLC resonant converter is selected as the DC/DC\nsubmodule of the MMDC, the operating curve of the LLC\nis needed for the design of the control system. Generally,\nthe voltage gain of the LLC is expressed as [37]\nM = Vo_ij\nnt Vi_ij\n=\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\n(ω2\nω2o\n)√m(m −1)\n(ω2\nω2p\n−1)+j( ω\nωo )(ω2\nω2o\n−1)(m−1)Qe\n⏐\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\n(17)\nwhere M denotes the voltage gain, Vo_ij denotes the output\nvoltage of the jth submodule in the ith group, nt denotes the\nTABLE 2. Parameters of the LLC resonant converter.\nFIGURE 8. Curve of voltage gain-frequency characteristic.\nvoltage ratio of the medium frequency transformer, ωdenotes\nthe angular frequency of the submodule, ωo and ωp denote\nthe resonant angular frequencies determined by the resonant\nelements Ls_LLC , Cs_LLC and Lp_LLC , which are shown in\nFig.6. m denotes the ratio of Lp_LLC +Ls_LLC to Ls_LLC .\nQe denotes the equivalent quality factor determined by the\nparameters and input power, shown as [37]\nQe =\n√\nLs_LLC\nCs_LLC\nπ2m\n8n2t (m −1)V 2\no_ij\nPin_ij (18)\nwhere Pin_ij denotes the input power of the jth submodule in\nthe ith group. According to the eqns.(17), (18) and parameters\nin Table 2, the voltage gain-frequency characteristic curve\non the condition of f0 = 6 kHz (f 0 is the corresponding\nfrequency of ωo) and m = 6 can be expressed as Fig.8,\nwhich shows that both Qe and f have impact on voltage\ngain. Assuming that the onshore MMC regulates the DC\nvoltage of high-voltage side as a constant, and the submodule\noutput voltages are balanced well, and PMSGs connect to the\nMVDC via diode rectiﬁers, the input voltage of the MMDC\nvaries following the excitation electromotive force of the\nwind turbine. Thus, according to eqns. (16) and (17), the sub-\nmodule voltage gain is dependent on the excitation electro-\nmotive force of PMSG (e s). In the meantime, the Qe is also\ndependent on the input power, see eqn. (19), which is a func-\ntion of es. Hence, the operating points shift among the volt-\nage gain-frequency curves with the varying es (i.e. varying\n15740 VOLUME 8, 2020\nP. Huet al.: MMDC Transformer-Based DC Transmission System for PMSG-Based Offshore Wind Farm Integration\nFIGURE 9. Operating curve of the LLC resonant converter.\nwind speeds). The operating curve can be obtained by con-\nnecting these operating points together.\nTo obtain the submodule operating curve, submitting eqn.\n(14) into eqn. (18) yields\nQe = π2mNwkopt\n√\nLs_LLC Cs_LLC\n8n2t (m −1)V 2\no_ijnkn3pψ3\nf Cs_LLC\ne3\ns =Ce3\ns (19)\nwhere\nC = π2mNwkopt\n√\nLs_LLC Cs_LLC\n8n2t (m −1)V 2\no_ijnkn3pψ3\nf Cs_LLC\nThen, submitting eqn. (16) into eqn. (17) yields\nM = Vo_ij\nn2t Vi_ij\n= 2NsmVo_ij\n(A +\n√\nA2 −4Be2s )nt es\n(20)\nIn eqns. (19) and (20), A, B and C all are constants. Each es\nhas a corresponding M and Qe. Additionally, to ensure soft\nswitching of IGBTs and zero recovery loss of diodes, the\noperating points should locate between the ωp and ω0 [28].\nBy selecting a set of es in the value range and calculating\nthe corresponding M and Qe, the operating curve of the\nsubmodule can be obtained as Fig.9.\nB. CONTROL STRATEGY\nTo ensure the proposed system working normally, three main\ncontrol goals need to be reached: (1) MPPT of PSMGs;\n(2) input currents balance between the submodule groups;\n(3) input voltages balance of submodules in the same group.\nAccording to the operating curve in Fig.9, the voltage gain\n(M) is a decreasing function of working frequency (f ), so the\ninput voltage of submodule could be regulated by adjusting\nthe working frequency. Additionally, the input current of\nsubmodule (Iin_ij) would be taken as the inner loop feedback\nvariable to improve the dynamic characteristic of the control\nloop. Thus, the submodule input voltage regulation loop is\nshown as Fig.10 (a). It is worth mentioning that the input\nvoltage reference, which is denoted by Vsmref , is the same, if\neach group contains the same submodule count. Another goal\nis to equally share the output currents of the diode rectiﬁers\nFIGURE 10. Two-level control strategies of the MMDC.\nFIGURE 11. Circuit schematic diagram of simulation model.\nbetween the submodule groups. Since the groups have the\nsame input voltage (V in), the current sharing is equivalent to\nthe input power sharing. Thus, a regulator of input power\nof submodule groups is designed as Fig.10 (b), while this\nregulator generates the input submodule voltage reference.\nMoreover, the input power of submodule groups is generated\nby equally sharing of the output power of the wind turbine,\nwhich outputs the maximum power according to the wind\nspeed, as shown in Fig.10 (b). The submodule voltage balance\nregulator needs to be implemented in each LLC submodule,\ni.e., there are k ×n submodule voltage balance controllers,\nmeanwhile there are k input power balance of groups reg-\nulators. Hence, it is reasonable to deploy the voltage bal-\nance regulators in the lower-level controller, while the power\nbalance regulators in the upper-level controller. In addition,\nthe onshore MMC employs the conventional dq-decoupled\ncontrol to regulate the HVDC bus voltage, which is not shown\nhere anymore.\nIV. SIMULATION VERIFICATION\nTo verify the feasibility of the proposed system, a simula-\ntion model as shown in Fig.11, which includes a WPGU,\na high-voltage cable and a DC source, is constructed in\nthe PSCAD/EMTDC software environment.

To simplify the simulation model, only one\nWPGU is employed, and the onshore MMC is simpliﬁed as a\nDC source with rated voltage 400kV. The rated input and out-\nput voltages of the MMDC are 8kV and 400kV, respectively.\nThe rated input and output voltages of each LLC resonant\nconverter are 1kV and 2.5kV, respectively. Thus, the step-\nup gain of the MMDC reaches 50. Other parameters of the\nMMDC are illustrated in Table 3 and 4.\nTo validate the performance of the MMDC under the con-\ndition of wind speed variation. The transient-state process is\ndesigned as follow: at t =3s, wind speed reduces from 12 m/s\nto 6 m/s, and then maintains 6 m/s for 3s, ﬁnally, rises to\n10 m/s.\nFig. 12 shows the system performance during this simu-\nlation process. Fig.12(a) illustrates that the power reference\nvaries according to the wind speed, meanwhile the actual\noutput power tracks the power reference quickly and stably.\nFig.12(b) and (c) show that the input voltage and current\nof the MMDC transformer response to the step change of\nwind speed quickly and stably, as analyzed before. Through\nthe MMDC transformer, the output current behaves stable,\nshown in Fig.12(d). Fig.12 (e) and (f) show the input and\noutput voltages of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th submodules in group 1,\nFIGURE 13. Circuit schematic diagram of the experimental system.\nFIGURE 14.

The ripples of these\nvoltages are only 1% of the rated value. Deserved to be men-\ntioned, voltages of all submodules are balanced well and the\nthree submodules in group 1 are selected as representatives.\nFig.12 (g) shows that the input currents of the 1st, 3rd, and\n5th groups are selected well balanced during the transient\nprocess. Fig.12 (h) and (i) depict the output voltages and\ncurrents of the PMSG. Overall, the simulation results validate\nthe feasibility of the proposed system and the effectiveness of\nthe control strategy.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 15743\nP.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nTo further verify the proposed topology and control strategy, a\ndown-scaled MMDC transformer based DC transmission sys-\ntem is built in laboratory. The WPGU is modelled by a power\nampliﬁer, and the onshore MMC is represented by a two-level\nVSC. Due to the limitation of experimental conditions, only\none WPGU is deployed in the system. The circuit schematic\ndiagram of the down-scaled system is depicted in Fig.13,\nwhere the power is drawn from the distribution network and\nthen feeds back to it. The key element of the system is\nthe MMDC transformer, which consists of three groups and\neach group comprises three LLC resonant converters in the\nexperimental setup, shown in Fig.14. The voltage variables\nand current directions are depicted in Fig.14 as well, which\nmakes it easier to understand the experimental results. Then,\nthe photo of the experimental setup is shown in Fig.15.\nParameters of the down-scaled experimental system are illus-\ntrated in Table 5 to 7.\nThe wind speed step test is designed to examine the\ntransient-state performances of the system. As seen in Fig.13,\nthe DC voltage of the high-voltage side is regulated by the\nVSC, which is set to 750V. At the beginning, the wind speed\nis 9 m/s; from t =30s on, the wind speed steps up to 10 m/s;\nand then it steps down to 8 m/s at t =70s. Fig.16 and 17\nillustrate performances of the MMDC prototype during this\ntest. Fig.16(a) shows that the input voltages of the ﬁrst sub-\nmodules of the three groups are balanced well during both the\nsteady state and transient state. Fig.16(b) illustrates that the\noutput voltages of the three sub-modules are also balanced\nwell with little difference, which can be ignored. And the\noutput voltages keep constant during the whole procedure.\nFIGURE 15. The photo of the experimental setup.\nFIGURE 16. Voltage and current sharing performances of the MMDC\nprototype.\nFig.16(c) shows that the input currents of the three groups are\nalso balanced well. The three ﬁgures validate the effective-\nness of the proposed voltage balancing and current balancing\ncontrol strategy. In addition, the input power, input voltage\nand output voltage of the MMDC are depicted in Fig.17,\n15744 VOLUME 8, 2020\nP.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a modular multiple DC transformer based DC\ntransmission system, which has the characteristics of high\nefﬁciency, low cost and high reliability, for PMSG based wind\nfarm integration is proposed. Mathematical relationship of\nthe proposed system in comprehensively investigated. A two-\nlevel control strategy which could realize both MPPT for\nPMSG and voltage/current balance for MMDC transformer\nis proposed and veriﬁed. A detailed complicated simulation\nmodel is constructed and a down-scaled prototype is pre-\nsented. Both simulation and experimental results validate\nthe feasibility of the system and effectiveness of the control\nstrategy.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to express gratitude to Prof. D.
