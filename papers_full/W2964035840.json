I NTRODUCTION\nThe development of software systems is a series of complex\nintellectual activities involving the collaboration of individuals.\nThe resulting artifacts are intangible, and this poses challenges\nwith respect to the perception of project progress from the\npoint of view of developers, managers, and customers. The\ncurrent economic systems demand short time to market, high\nquality, and the necessity to stay in budget. This complex\nintertwining of factors and demands is ruled by time pressure,\nstress, and emotional trauma [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].\nStress is the scourge of the modern industrial world [6] and\nmental-health diseases related to the working environment are\non the rise [7]. While studies of affect are emerging and rising\nin software engineering research, stress has yet to ﬁnd its place\nin the software engineering literature, with very few studies\nscattered through the last two decades. While these studies are\ndesirable, they are based on the survey approach.\nIn this paper, we are opening a line of research of stress\nin software engineering, and we start with a study of stress\ncoping with the affect-laden framework of Salutogenesis [8].\nSalutogenesis (detailed in the next section) is a validated\nmethod which supports mental health through a feeling of co-\nherence. The method can be applied to software development\nprocesses, methods, and tools.\nWe are presenting our research proposal for a controlled\nexperiment of stress coping mechanisms in software quality\nenhancements. We hypothesize that a software tool (Find-\nBugs), when enhanced using the Salutogenesis model, will\nbring 1) a higher number of ﬁxed quality issues, 2) higher\ncognitive capacity, 3) reduction of the overall stress, and\n4) positive affect induction effects compared to the non-\nenhanced version of the tool. The controlled experiment will\nmake use of validated physiological measurements of stress as\nproxied by cortisol and α-amylase levels in saliva samples [9],\na psychometrically validated measurement of mood and affect\ndisposition [10], and stress inductors such as a cognitive load\ntask test [11]. This will enable us to test out causality chains\nand indicators from the endocrine system, which will bring us\nto a stronger empirical case. If our hypotheses are empirically\nvalidated, the results will offer a new method for enhancing the\nquality of software systems while reducing the overall stress\nof developers.\nIn the rest of the present paper, we will talk about stress\nand affect theory, and then we will explain our proposed\nexperiment design. Because of space limitations, we cite\nrelated work where ﬁtting.\nII. S TRESS AND SALUTOGENESIS\nA. Stress, Affect, and Software Development\nWe have adopted Weinert’s [12] deﬁnition of stress as “. . . an\nadaptive reaction to exceeding psychic or physical demands\nof the surroundings.”. Constraints and demands are connected\nto the build up of stress [12], [13]. The following conditions\narXiv:1701.05739v2  [cs.SE]  22 Feb 2017\nhave to be met for the generation of a stress response by the\nindividual.\n(c1) The outcomes of the triggering event must not be\nknown beforehand. (c2) The results of the trigger have to\nbe important to the individual. For example, stress arises\nif an individual cannot be sure that a deadline can be met\nand that the consequences could be catastrophic, e.g. loss of\nemployment.\nOne of the most prominent stress process theories, namely\nthe General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) by Selye [14], has\nbuilt upon the previously deﬁned factors and conditions. GAS\ndeﬁnes three stages, which we outline together with a software\nengineering scenario. 1) The Alarm Phase: The individual\nrecognizes the triggering event and reacts to it, according to\nthe severity of the event. In extreme cases, a blockade can\nhappen, which hinders the individual to act. For example, a\ndeveloper could enter the alarm phase after a sudden report\nof hundred problems by a static analysis tool. The event\nwould not be expected, and an immediate solution to the\nproblem would have yet to emerge. 2) The Resistance Phase:\nThe individual tries to antagonize the stress triggering event\nand overcome it. If the individual succeeds in overcoming\nthe triggering event, the stress situation ends at this phase.\nIn our scenario, the developer would now start the triage\nprocess and ﬁxing the issues, one by one. 3) The Exhaustion\nPhase: If the stress generating situation persist, it might\nlead to psychophysiological exhaustion. The individual stops\nresisting and slips into a form of blockade. The blockade\ncan range from minor physical problems to paralysis (like\nshell-shocked soldiers in the ﬁrst world war) and depressive\nstates even leading to suicidal tendencies [15] [16] [17]. For\nour unlucky developer, the exhaustion phase might start when\nthey run out of ideas for solving the problems at hand, and\nno exiting solutions have emerged yet. The developer would\nnow stop resisting and surrender to the impeding situation.\nThe consequences of the exhaustion phase, unless mediated\nby changing task, obtaining help, or ﬁxing the issues, could\nlead to serious health issues reaching from rather harmless\npsychosomatic back pain to burnout or depression or even\ndeath by an heart attack [18].\nOur scenario will likely elicit an empathic response to\nthe reader, as it looks like a negative experience . Negative\nexperiences are dominated by negative affect [19]. A link\nbetween stress and affect seems intuitive. Feldman et al. [20]\nhave reported that traditional views of stress and disease\nsuggest that our appraisal of threats with negative emotions\nleads to physiological changes that inﬂuence disease onset and\nprogression. Indeed, the relationship between stress and affect\nis complex as the two constructs are intertwined. In a study\nof 420 individuals, stress was found positively correlated with\nthe state affect of anxiety and depression [21]. Physiological\nresponses such as cardiovascular ones were also found to\nbe positively correlated with negative emotions and stressor\ntasks [20]. Furthermore, workplace settings require emotional\nregulation in response to stress, which causes emotional disso-\nnance that is linked to detriment of psychological health [22],\n[23]. Although the cause-and-consequence relationship type\nhas yet to be explored, the correlation between affect, stress,\nand negative physiological responses has been established.\nSoftware developers are not immune to the stress threat, as\nthe development of software is a very stressful activity [1].\nWe found out recently that stress is an output of unhappiness\nand negative affect among software developers [24], and it is\nknown that stress leads to burnout among developers [25]. Yet,\nmediating the negative affect of developers has been theorized\nto be effective in terms of unhappiness mediation and the\nsubsequent programming performance boost [2].\nSummarizing, stress is bad for all workers, developers\nincluded (if not even more damaging than with other jobs), and\nits reduction should be of importance to researchers of soft-\nware engineering and practitioners. The Salutogenesis model\nis a proposal to counteract stress, and it can be integrated\ninto the software development process as well as development\ntools.\nB. Salutogenesis: an Affect-laden Framework to Reduce Stress\nSalutogenesis was introduced by Antonovsky [8] and later\nrecalled by a review study by Eriksson and Lindstr ¨om [26].\nSalutogenesis is a model to explain the origin of health as in\ncontrast to pathogenesis, which explores instead the manner of\ndevelopment of a disease. The model considers the concept of\nhealth as a continuum between total ill health and total health.\nThe health continuum is inﬂuenced by affect (as companions\nof stressors and resistors), and attitudes. An important inﬂu-\nencer is the feeling of coherence, which is a feeling of being\nconsistent with the happenings in our life, which fosters the\nemergence and steadiness of health. Salutogenesis identiﬁes\nthree pillars that support health by boosting the feeling of\ncoherence.\n1) Understandability, or comprehensibility, enables humans\nto recognize the known and unknown stimuli of life as ordered\nand structured events and not as chaotic or arbitrary. For\nexample, well commented and structured code brings a sense\nof understandability of the system. 2) Manageability, or the\nability to overcome obstacles, means the degree to which\nsomeone has the resources to overcome a given tasks. For\nexample, having the time to do a job right rather then having to\ncut work short or leaving parts unﬁnished. 3) Meaningfulness,\nor the degree of sense of a stimulus. It reﬂects how much a\nsituation or task makes sense to individuals and how important\nthe stimulus is perceived. Meaningfulness is also an important\ninﬂuencer of motivation, and it adds to seeing a task as a\nchallenge rather then a burden. For example, showing workers\nhow their task’s output contributes to the success of a whole\nproject rather then just telling them to just do their work.\nThe extent to which these three factors have to be met for the\nindividual to stay healthy, experiencing less stress, depends on\nthe individual’s general resistance resources [8]. The amount\nand types of these resources which are available to the\nindividual depends on genetic, constitution and psychosocial\naspects like intelligence, commitment, general attitude towards\nlife, and basic mood [8].\nSalutogenesis predicts that the more these three values\napply, the deeper the feeling of coherence is experienced\nand so living is experienced as less stressful, reducing the\nlikelihood of becoming ill. Studies have found support for the\nmodel’s claims [26] [27] [28].\nIII. F IND BUGS AND ENHANCEMENTS\nFindBugs is a static analysis tool. It was born out of the idea\nto catch trivial mistakes developers make on a daily basis–\nwhich FindBugs calls bug patterns . We made enhancements\nto the Eclipse plugin of FindBugs based on the three pillars\nof Salutogenesis [8]. Because of space restrictions, we enlist\nhere only one enhancement per pillar. We reported all enhance-\nments elsewhere [29].\nWe introduced the ability to leave comments to a class of\nbug patterns to communicate thoughts on a bug, e.g., why it\nis a false positive or why it is highly important to ﬁx that one.\nThis increases the understandability.\nTo increase the manageability, we created buttons that will\nreduce the amount of warnings shown in ﬁve levels to offer\nthe users their preferred level of manageability.\nMeaningfulness is increased by the possibility to mark false\npositive warnings which are ﬁrst sorted into a special section\nof FindBugs’bug explorer and are hidden after a new analysis.\nIV. E XPERIMENT DESIGN\nTo test our hypothesized improvements (higher number\nof ﬁxed issues, higher cognitive capacity, reduction of the\noverall stress, positive affect induction effects) of applying\nSalutogenesis model to the static analysis tool FindBugs,\nwe propose the following controlled experiment, which we\nrepresent in Fig. 1.\nAfter expressing written informed consent, the participants\nwill have 5 minutes to rest. This is one of our strategies\nfor limiting endogenous stressors that could originate before\nstarting the experiment.\nWe will take a ﬁrst saliva sample (azure boxes in Fig. 1) to\nestablish the baseline stress measures for the cortisol and α-\namylase measurements. Cortisol and α-amylase are two stress\nindicators, well established in the medical stress research [9].\nTo assess potential stress sources, the participants will then\nﬁll in questionnaires (red boxes in Fig. 1): Demographic\nquestions such as gender, age, pre-existing neurological or\npsychological conditions, and medical drug intake will let\nus control the hormone level measurement. To keep a low\nnoise within the measurements, we ask the participants to not\nconsume beverage containing sugar (including unsweetened\ntea or coffee) or smoke one hour before the experiment.\nWe will add items related to stress perception and three\nfactors to assess the participants’ debugging skills and the\nparticipants’ self evaluation of these skills. The self evaluation\nis an indicator for the coherence feeling. A third questionnaire\naims at self-efﬁcacy which gives us some hints on the stress\nresilience of the participants. We use the PANAS scale [10]\nto assess the participants’ mood.\nThe next step measures the participants cognitive capacity\n(rose boxes), as our hypotheses imply that stress reduced work-\ning as proxied by Salutogenesis frees cognitive capacity. We\nwill use the N-Back-Test to assess the cognitive capacity [11]\nwhich is implemented and run in the PEBL environment [30].\nWe will take a second saliva sample to be able to assess\nthe stress generated by these questionnaires and the cognitive\nload test (offset stress), so that we can distinguish between the\nbuild up of stress through the cognitive testing and the stress\ngenerated in the debugging task.\nThe participants are randomly assigned to two balanced\ngroups: those using the vanilla FindBugs (violet boxes)\nand those using the Salutogenesis-enhanced FindBugs (green\nboxes). Each participant will work on the same codebase (the\nopen-source project Sweet Home 3D ). A FindBugs analysis\non the code base reveals about 100 ﬁndings covering every\nseverity and conﬁdence rank as well as over 20 different\ncategories of ﬁndings.\nThe participants will use the tool for 25 min., after which\nwe take a third saliva sample which is expected to be a peak\nstress moment according to the literature.\nAfter that, the participants will work to the code for other\n20 min. The task ends with a fourth and last saliva sample,\nwhich represents the ﬁnal stress measure.\nTo assess the cognitive resources consumed by the previous\nwork on the code we have the participants take the N-Back-\nTest again. To lessen any possible learning effects we will use\na different N-Back style for the second measurement.\nFinally, to assess the potential inﬂuence of the\nSalutogenesis-enhanced version of FindBugs, we ask\nthe participants to ﬁll out a second PANAS and knowledge\nquestionnaires.\nAs stress inductors, besides the debugging task itself, we\nwill set up a contest where those that are able to ﬁx at least\n6 ﬁndings from 4 different categories can win a 10,00 Euro\nvoucher for the university cafeteria. Also, participants will be\naware that a public (yet anonymized) ranking of the correctly\nﬁxed FindBugs ﬁndings will be published.\nThe results of the work on the code with both FindBugs ver-\nsions will be reviewed to count the successfully ﬁxed ﬁndings.\nScreen captures will be checked for potential anomalies and\nfor assessing solution strategies by the participants. The count\nof the successfully ﬁxed ﬁndings will be used to determine\nthe winners of the voucher.\nThe experiment procedure will be implemented by fol-\nlowing the Helsinki declaration’s [31] ethical and privacy\nconsiderations. We are already collaborating with the state’s\ndata protection agency (Zendas) in regards.\nV. C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nIn this paper, we have proposed a controlled experiment\nfor testing our hypotheses that a static analysis tool enhanced\nwith Salutogenesis will bring 1) a higher number of ﬁxed\nsoftware quality issues, 2) reduced cognitive load, 3) reduction\nof the overall stress, and 4) positive affect induction effects to\ndevelopers.\nFig. 1. Steps of the Proposed Experiment for Assessing Stress and Emotional Responses of a Salutogenesis-Enhanced Software Tool\nCompared to other ways to evaluate stress—such as the\nmeasurement of skin resistance, heart rate, or adrenaline\nin blood—our method does not require on-site support of\nmedically trained staff, is easily applicable on larger groups,\nand is more objective than textual psychological tests (e.g.,\nquestionnaires). While the assessment of the results still re-\nquires the involvement of a chemistry laboratory, just a couple\nof researchers would be able to gather hundreds of samples.\nYet, our proposed design is complex, and its execution requires\nsigniﬁcant effort. We aim to pilot the experiment before\nattending SEmotion’17. We are still looking for improvements\nto the design, measurement techniques, and reducing costs and\neffort.\nShall our hypotheses ﬁnd empirical support, our study\nresults and our proposed improvements based on the Salu-\ntogenesis model have the potential to offer a new method for\nenhancing the quality of software systems while reducing the\noverall stress of developers.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nDaniel Graziotin has been supported by the Alexander von\nHumboldt (AvH) Foundation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.
