Peer conver-\nsations, as an important aspect within the interactive process, are\ncrucial for the effectiveness of the interaction [21]. Advancements\nin AI, especially in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT\nwith transformer architecture [11], are enhancing human commu-\nnication by effectively simulating natural language interactions\n[6].\nPrior research has explored the integration of conversational\nagents in interactions with children [1]. In the context of education,\npedagogical conversational agents play a pivotal role in facilitating\nrich learning interactions, serving as an effective means of interven-\ntion in children’s learning processes [23], and impacting learners’\nemotional experiences [ 15]. Existing research has discussed the\nroles of conversational agents as teachers or learning facilitators,\nand a few studies also explored their role as peers [23]. However,\nthe majority of this research implies the one-on-one child-agent\ninteraction in learning [14]. Research on designing peer agents in\nchildren’s collaborative learning, especially in peer conversations,\nis limited, with the impact of different roles like team moderator or\nparticipant on these conversations still largely unexplored.\narXiv:2403.14227v1  [cs.HC]  21 Mar 2024\nJiawen Liu, Yuanyuan Yao, Pengcheng An, and Qi Wang\nOur pilot study aims to preliminarily explore this less-addressed\nopportunity. Namely, we conducted two design-based collabora-\ntive learning workshops with children. Six child participants, aged\n11-12, were randomly assigned to different peer roles and collab-\norated to address \"urban and environmental design challenges in\n2050\", creating relevant design solutions. An LLM-based peer agent,\nhereinafter referred to as ’peer agent’. participated as a team mem-\nber in each of the two workshops, respectively playing the role\nof a team moderator or a participant, engaging in dialogues with\nother children as their learning collaboration unfolded. The peer\nagent consisted of OpenAI ’s GPT-3.5 and voice output devices.\nThe agent’s roles were established through iteratively designed and\nuser-validated prompts.\nThe workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim\nfor a qualitative thematic analysis to explore how the agent, in\nits dual roles, influenced peer conversations, encompassing both\nagent-children and children-children conversations. The research\nfindings indicate that peer agent exhibits distinct advantages and\nchallenges in both roles. When functioning as a moderator in chil-\ndren’s discussions, peer agent can relatively effectively control the\npace and structure of the discussion. However, it is prone to lack-\ning authority, resulting in some children overlooking its guidance\nor instruction. In the other case, when peer agent acts as a team\nparticipant, its responses could stimulate children’s creative think-\ning and supplement their knowledge gaps. In this situation, the\ntimeliness of the agent’s responses to the evolving collaborative\ndynamics is vital. Additionally, the agent’s verbal input during the\nprototyping phase may pose challenges, as children tend to focus\nmore on nonverbal aspects of collaboration.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Peer Conversations in Children’s\nCollaborative Learning\nCollaborative learning refers to members actively engaging in activ-\nities or tasks within a group, fostering children’s reasoning abilities\n[8]. The goal is to collectively solve problems through cooperation\n[25]. Conversations among peers play a pivotal role in affording\nthe effectiveness of collaborative learning [27]. Over the past few\ndecades, numerous scholars have conducted research on peer inter-\nactions, with a substantial amount of learning-based interactions\nand conversations occurring in educational settings [7]. Peer con-\nversations among children in collaborative learning serve as pri-\nmary venues for the development of children’s communication and\ncollaboration abilities, providing them with extensive opportunities\nfor interactive learning and social development [4, 20].\nExisting research has delved into children’s peer conversation\nabilities [29], collective aspects, and interactive experiences [22].\nDiscussions on children’s peer conversations can contribute to as-\nsessing their potential pragmatic and conversational skills [ 30].\nHowever, the majority of existing research has taken place within\nthe field of linguistics and education. There remains a limited explo-\nration of children’s peer conversation abilities in human-computer\ninteraction design. Potential research on how to facilitate peer\nconversations through HCI designs is an important avenue that\nrequires further investigation.\n2.2 Conversational Agent in Children’s\nCollaborative Learning\nIn the context of children’s peer conversations, interacting with\nknowledgeable others can enhance the quality and trust of these\ninteractions [28, 33]. Previous studies have introduced additional\nroles into peer conversation processes [ 31], leading to positive\nemotional experiences for learners [16].\nPedagogical conversational agents can interact with multiple\nusers and participate in bidirectional dialogues [ 35], which are\nconsidered effective tools for assisting children in the learning\nprocess [24]. They can engage and understand the learners. [9, 18].\nConversational agents can assume various roles when interacting\nwith students in classroom, such as tutors and peers. As tutors,\nagents establish rules and guide children through specific tasks. [24].\nAs peers, they focus more on equality [10] and emotional feedback\n[17]to enhance children’s learning capabilities [ 3]. In children’s\ncollaborative activities, current studies primarily focus on the role\nof agents as assistants or tutors, with a emphasis on the impact of\nagents on learning outcomes and abilities [13, 14]. Research on the\nrole of conversational agents as peers in collaborative learning and\ntheir influence on peer conversations is relatively scarce. Hence,\nthe question of what peer role that conversational agents should\nassume in children’s collaborative learning, and in what manner to\nbetter influence peer conversations becomes a research question\nworthy of further exploration.\n3 METHODS\nThe study organized two collaborative workshops on ‘Exploring\nUrban and Natural Environments in 2050 with AI, ’ chosen for its\nbroad appeal and interactive potential. Four roles were set up in each\nworkshop: moderator (organizes and coordinates the team, ensuring\non-schedule progress), designer (transforms ideas into innovative\ndesigns), engineer (focuses on applying future technologies like\nsustainable energy in designs), and scientist (provides expertise\non natural and urban sciences for sustainable solutions). The peer\nagent, participated as a team moderator or a team participant. Each\nworkshop consisted of four phases: problem identification, design\nconceptualization, prototyping, and presentation.\nModer at or Designer Engineer\nScientist\nScientist\nEngineerDesignerModer at or\ndesign st a ge Out comegroup p articip ant\nP eer agent as t eam moder at or\nP eer agent as t eam par ticipant\nW orkshop Pr ocess\nSt ep1\nPr oblem identification\nSt ep2\nDesign conceptualization\nSt ep3\nPr ot otyping\nSt ep3\nPr esentation\nFigure 2: Outcomes and process overview of children’s col-\nlaborative learning workshops.\n3.1 Participants\nWe invited six participants in aged 11-12 years through an online\nplatform, their language abilities are comparable based on the as-\nsessments of Children’s Communication Checklist[3].\nPeerGPT: Probing the Roles of LLM-based Peer Agents as Team Moderators and Participants in Children’s Collaborative Learning\nTable 1: The roles and tasks of participants in collaborative learning workshops\nGroup Participant Age Gender Role Role Task\nPeer agent as team moderator\nP1 12 boy Designer Design Ideation and Planning\nP2 11 boy Scientist Providing Scientific Knowledge\nP3 12 boy Engineer Offering Technical Insights\nPeer agent as team participant\nP4 12 girl designer Design Ideation and Planning\nP5 11 boy Scientist Providing Scientific Knowledge\nP6 12 boy Moderator Coordinating Team Collaboration\nBefore the study, we firstly invited their parents to fill out the\ninformed consent form. Then, the children were randomly assigned\ninto different roles in two groups for a collaborative learning task.\nPrior to the workshops, we prepared role cards to clarify the chil-\ndren’s role identities1 (children’s names were anonymous).\n3.2 The Peer Agent Design\nWe utilized GPT-3.5 and remote voice-output devices as a proto-\ntype for the agent to engage in peer conversations with children.\nInitially, we provided different instructions to GPT:informing about\nthe workshop’s theme and process,detailing the role and tasks they\nneeded to take, advising on the appropriate attitudes and charac-\nteristics required foreach role, and correcting any inappropriate\ncontent generated.This preparation ensured that the peer agent’s\noutput was consistent with the identities of both the moderator\nand the participant, facilitating meaningful interaction in the two\nworkshops. We named the peer agent Blue.\nIn Group ‘Peer agent as moderator’, Blue facilitated the four\nproject phases, guiding elementary school participantsthrough tran-\nsitions between them. The peer agent utlized multiple techniques to\nencourage participant speech and interaction, including introduced\nstructured phases, outlined tasks, established speaking orders for\nrounds, addressed participants’ inquiries or concerns, and summa-\nrized participant statements.\nIn Group ‘Peer agent as participant’, Blue played the role of an\nengineer, mainly tasked with delivering knowledge pertinent to its\ncharacter. Blue engaged in various aspects of the workshop using\nfour main methods: firstly, it proposed feasible technical solutions to\nother participants; secondly, it offered technical advice in response\nto questions from participants in other roles; thirdly, clarified its\nown role and identity; and finally, it requested details about its\nspecific tasks for the current phase from the participant designated\nas the project manager.\n3.3 Data Collection and Analysis\nThis study primarily employed the qualitative data analysis method\nof thematic analysis [5], using MAXQDA coding software to analyze\nthe transcribed text from the workshop’s voice recordings. The\nfocus of this study was primarily on the peer conversations between\nchildren and agents, the descriptions of design concepts were not\nconsidered as a key analytical indicator.\nFurthermore, this study conducted quantitative analysis by tally-\ning the word count segments made by both peer agents and children\nduring the workshop’s four stages. This was done to calculate the\npercentage of agent’s input within peer conversations. The aim\nwas to gain insights into the extent of agent’s engagement in peer\ndialogues at varying stages of the workshop.\n4 RESULTS\nEach workshop lasted approximately two hours, resulting in a cu-\nmulative 262 minutes of audio and video data captured. In Group\nA, analysis was conducted on 583 segments, with 454 segments by\nchildren, 129 segments by the peer agent. In Group B, 612 segments\nwere collected for analysis, with 369 segments spoken by children\nand 57 segments by the peer agent. Ultimately, following the proce-\ndure of thematic analysis, this study identified 10 recurring themes\nrelated to peer conversations in children’s collaborative learning\nworkshop.\nThe peer agent participated as a peer alongside children in both\ntwo workshops, and resulting in a substantial amount of peer con-\nversations. However, when the agent played the two different roles\n(team moderator and participant) , the peer conversations between\nthe agent-children and children-children exhibited different char-\nacteristics.\n4.1 Peer Conversation Between Peer\nAgent-Children\n4.1.1 Peer Agent as Moderator.\nIgnoring the Peer Agent-Intiated Process/Instructions.\nW. hen the peer agent acts as a moderator, its longer messages\noften fail to capture children’s attention, who instead focus on\ntheir discussions or tasks. This results in delayed feedback to the\nBlue, reducing the effectiveness of communication. For instance,\nwhen Blue asked children to share their findings on urban and\nenvironmental issues, P1, busy playing with stationery in hand,\nremarked, \"What are we going to do?\" . The lack of non-verbal cues\nand immediate interaction like a human moderator, coupled with\nthe fact that it is presented on a tablet, diminishes its authority and\nappeal to children, leading them to easily ignore Blue.\nQuestioning the Peer Agent\nWhen the peer agent assumes the role of a moderator, children\nsometimes display negative emotions, question the peer agent, or\nstruggle to comprehend its instructions, which raises concerns\nabout the agent’s effectiveness. Nevertheless, these interactions\nserve as active communication, fostering the enhancement of the\npeer agent’s conversational strategies. When the agent communi-\ncates with clarity and a friendly tone, children tend to understand\nand assimilate information from the peer agent more successfully.\nInitiating Conversation About the Agent’s Role\nJiawen Liu, Yuanyuan Yao, Pengcheng An, and Qi Wang\nP eer agent as t eam par ticipantP eer agent as t eam moder at or\n\"Hello, e v er y one!

They actively initiated conversations\nwith peer agent, suggesting the need for reward and punishment\nsystems: P2 stated, \"I think Blue, as the manager, should fire any-\none who doesn’t perform well. \" P1 agreed, saying, \"Exactly, boss, we\nwant promotions and salary increases. \" Additionally, when peer agent\nacted as the moderator and provided clear process guidance, the time\nmanagement for each stage was relatively ideal.\n4.1.2 Peer Agent as Participant.\nInitiating Conversation and Responding to the Peer Agent\nChildren were able to effectively understand agent’s assigned\nrole in the workshop and proactively initiated conversations with\nagent, making requests. Peer agent assumed the role of respond-\ning to peer questions and completing peer tasks. It could tailor\nits responses based on the children’s requests, facilitating effec-\ntive communication. Children were also responsive to the agent’s\nsuggestions or questions.\nIn Group B, the moderator (P6) proactively sought advice from the\npeer agent. The agent responded, \"With the passage of time, numerous\nnew technologies will be introduced into our lives, ... perhaps we can\nexplore ideas from here?\" P6 then remarked, \"Excellent, does anyone\nhave thoughts on the new technologies mentioned by Blue?\"\nIgnore the Agent’s Suggestions\nHowever, during the prototyping and similar stages, children’s\npeer conversations became shorter, and communication often took\nnon-verbal forms such as hands-on activities. Peer agent couldn’t\nPeerGPT: Probing the Roles of LLM-based Peer Agents as Team Moderators and Participants in Children’s Collaborative Learning\nactively participate in the actual hands-on activities and couldn’t\naccurately perceive children’s non-verbal communication. As a\nresult, its suggestions were often ignored.\n4.2 Peer Conversation Between\nChildren-Children\n4.2.1 Peer Agent as Moderator.\nExpressing Negative Attitudes\nWhen peer agent takes on the role of a moderator, there are fewer\nopportunities for children to engage in free discussions. Children\ntend to prefer small group discussions or reporting ideas one by one,\nand there is a lack of conversational interaction among children\nthemselves. Additionally, when children express negative emotions\ntowards their peers, it can reduce the desire of the targeted peer to\nspeak up, and the agent cannot intervene promptly.\nWhen children urge their peers, the desire to speak diminishes. P3\nsaid, \"Regardless of what you want to change, as the engineer, you\nshould speak first. \" P1 added, \"Go, go, hurry up. \" At this moment, P3\nfell silent, unsure of how to express himself.\nInitiating and Engaging in Discussions\nHowever, during the prototyping and implementation phase,\npeer agent’s involvement did not significantly influence children’s\nfreedom to express themselves in peer conversations, allowing them\nmore independence in their thinking and making processes. In this\nstage, children engaged in more open discussions and began to\nproactively express their own views and opinions.\nAsking Peers and Initiating Discussions\nMoreover, during open discussions, children sought their peers’\nopinions on certain design details by asking questions and inviting\nsuggestions. This increased the depth of discussions related to the\ntopic, allowing for more detailed design proposals.\n4.2.2 Peer Agent as Participant.\nExtending Conversations Based Peer Utterances\nChildren frequently consult the agent for advice, leveraging its\nknowledge-rich content to steer peer discussions. In these cases,\npeer agent’s participation contributes creative material, nurturing\nwell-organized discussions centered around the topic. Nonetheless,\nit is imperative for the peer agent to promptly address the children’s\nneeds and deliver conversation input that is both valuable and\ncomprehensible.\nWhen P6 (moderator) asked peer agent for suggestions, peer agent\nproposed engineering advice for the architecture. P6 then continued,\n\"Blue mentioned our structure could continuously ascend vertically.\nWhat are your thoughts, everyone?\"\nSummarizing and Initiating Processes While Managing\nTasks\nWhen children moderate, they initiate processes and skillfully\nsummarize their peers’ discussions concisely. In contrast,peer agent\nin the moderator role engages in more detailed and structured\ncommunication. For example, at the conclusion of a phase, P6 in\nGroup B, serving as the moderator, summarized, \"Since we have all\nshared our ideas and designs, and Blue has provided us with some\nsummaries and suggestions, I believe we can move on to the next stage\nof prototype development. \"\n4.3 Peer Agent’s Involvement in Different\nStages of Peer Conversations\nThe result clearly indicate that peer agent plays a more significant\nrole in the first two stages of the workshop. During these stages,\nAI contributes by starting processes or speaking to the assigned\ntasks. However, its participation diminishes in the prototyping and\npresentation phases, as children’s communication becomes more\nnon-verbal, concise, and swift, resulting in limited interaction with\npeer agents.\nFigure 5: Comparison of peer agent’s participation in differ-\nent stages of the workshops\n5 DISCUSSION\nThe context of our study diverges from that of educational envi-\nronments [19], The way children engage in conversations during\ncollaborative learning may not only affect their learning outcomes\nbut also alter their cognitive development [33]. Our work demon-\nstrate the different impacts of peer agent’s roles as a team moderator\nand participant in children’s collaborative learning on peer con-\nversations among children and between children and agents. As\na moderator, the peer agent can effectively control the process of\ndiscussions.But when providing lengthy information, it may be\noverlooked. In the other case, when as a participant , it can en-\ncourage children to contemplate agent’s statements, provide the\nknowledge they may lack [2].\nFurthermore, we observed that timely perception and feedback\non children’s peer conversations are crucial in both scenarios[24] ,\nespecially during the first two phases of the workshop. This implies\nthat peer agent influences peer conversations not only through its\ndirect suggestions but also shapes the choice and depth of topics.\nOur research provides insights into the influence of peer agent in\ndifferent roles on children’s collaborative learning conversations,\noffering a novel perspective distinct from prior studies that predomi-\nnantly concentrated on the roles of peer agent as assistants or tutors\n[24], additionally,our research offer practical recommendations for\nthe design of peer agents based on specific peer roles.\nOur late-breaking work as an initial exploration into the impact\nof peer agent’s role on peer conversations in children’s collaborative\nlearning, providing insights can inform the design of larger-scale\nexperiments. For instance, agents capable of providing timely feed-\nback for children’s creative activities [34]. However, this research\nhas some limitations. Firstly, the small sample size could limit the\ngeneralizability of the result . Secondly, the study adopted an inter-\ngroup comparison approach to avoid cognitive redundancy, which\nmade it challenging to contrast the effects of different roles for\nthe peer agent through intra-group comparisons. Lastly, the de-\nsign application of peer agent in our study are preliminary, need\nJiawen Liu, Yuanyuan Yao, Pengcheng An, and Qi Wang\nimprovement in terms of language feedback effectiveness and ap-\npearance.Future work aims to address the limitations of this study,\nrefine the experimental design. Additionally, future research seeks\nto explore more dimensions of how peer agents influence peer\nconversations, including aspects related to non-verbal interactions.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Sara Aeschlimann, Marco Bleiker, Michael Wechner, and Anja Gampe. 2020.\nCommunicative and social consequences of interactions with voice assistants.\nComputers in Human Behavior 112 (Nov. 2020), 106466. https://doi.org/10.1016/\nj.chb.2020.106466\n[2] Linda Allal and Greta Pelgrims Ducrey. 2000.
