Introduction \n \n1 Friction stir welding (FSW) is a relatively new joining \nprocess that has been used for high production since \n1996. Because melting does not occur and joining takes \nplace below the melting temperature of the material, a \nhigh-quality weld is created. This characteristic greatly \nreduces the ill effects of high heat input, including \ndistortion, and eliminates solidif ication defects. \nFriction stir welding also is highly efficient, produces \nno fumes, and uses no filler material, which makes this \nprocess environmentally friendly. \n Friction stir welding was invented by The Welding \nInstitute (TWI) in December 1991. TWI filed \nsuccessfully for patents in Europe, the U.S., Japan, and \nAustralia. TWI then established TWI Group -Sponsored \nProject 5651,\"Development of the New Friction Stir \nTechnique for Welding Aluminium,\" in 1992 to further \nstudy this technique. \n The developmen t project was conducted in three \nphases. Phase I proved FSW to be a realistic and \npractical welding technique, while at the same time \naddressing the welding of 6000 series aluminium \nalloys. Phase II successfully examined the welding of \naerospace and ship a luminium alloys, 2000 and 5000 \nseries, respectively. Process parameter tolerances, \nmetallurgical characteristics, and mechanical \nproperties for these materials were established. Phase \nIII developed pertinent data for further \nindustrialization of FSW. \n                                                           \n*Corresponding author’s ORCID ID: 0000-0003-4939-359X \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.14741/ijcet/v.8.6.2  \nSince its invention, the process has received world -\nwide attention, and today FSW is used in research and \nproduction in many sectors, including aerospace, \nautomotive, railway, shipbuilding, electronic housings, \ncoolers, heat exchangers, and nuclear waste containers. \nIn FSW, a cylindrical, shouldered tool with a profiled \nprobe is rotated and slowly plunged into the weld joint \nbetween two pieces of sheet or plate material that are \nto be welded together (Figure 1). The parts must be \nclamped onto a backing bar in a manner that prevents \nthe abutting joint faces from being forced apart or in \nany other way moved out of position. \n Frictional heat is generated between the wear -\nresistant welding tool and the material of the \nworkpieces. This heat causes the workpieces to so ften \nwithout reaching the melting point and allows the tool \nto traverse along the weld line. The resultant \nplasticized material is transferred from the leading \nedge of the tool to the trailing edge of the tool probe \nand is forged together by the intimate c ontact of the \ntool shoulder and the pin profile. This leaves a solid -\nphase bond between the two pieces. \n The function of the tool shoulder is to provide heat \nby application of a large compressive force and tool \nrotation over the surface of the material bei ng welded \nand to contain the softened, plasticized metal beneath \nit. The compressive stress also minimizes the \nformation of voids or pores in the consolidated metal. \nIn the case of welding thin sheets, almost all of the \nfrictional heat is provided by the f riction between the \ntool shoulder and the work piece. \nAkshansh Mishra et al                        Analysis of Tools used in Friction Stir Welding process                                                                                                                                                                                \n \n1520| International Journal of Current Engineering and Technology, Vol.8, No.6 (Nov/Dec 2018) \n \n \n \nFigure 1: A schematic diagram showing FSW process \n \nThe function of the tool probe is to move the highly \nplasticized material from the front of the probe to the \nrear and also to move the material in a  vertical \ndirection. The latter movement of the plasticized \nmaterial is achieved by the presence of threads or \nsimilar features on the tool probe. The probe also \npromotes dispersion of oxides or impurities present in \nthe joint line. As the thickness of the  plate increases, \nthe ratio of heat input from the shoulder to heat input \nfrom the probe decreases. The schematic diagram of \ntool geometry is shown in the Figure 2. \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Schematic representation of Tool geometry \n \n2. Tool material selection \n \nWeld q uality and tool wear are two important \nconsiderations in the selection of tool material, the \nproperties of which may affect the weld quality by \ninﬂuencing heat generation and dissipation. The weld \nmicrostructure may also be affected as a result of \ninteraction with eroded tool material. Apart from the \npotentially undesirable effects on the weld \nmicrostructure, signiﬁcant tool wear increases the \nprocessing cost of FSW. Owing to the severe heating of \nthe tool during FSW, signiﬁcant wear may result if the \ntool material has low yield strength at high \ntemperatures. Stresses experienced by the tool are \ndependent on the strength of the work - piece at high \ntemperatures common under the FSW conditions. \nTemperatures in the workpiece depend on the material \nproperties of  tool, such as thermal conductivity, for a \ngiven workpiece and processing parameters. The \ncoefﬁcient of thermal expansion may affect the thermal \nstresses in the tool. Other factors that may inﬂuence \ntool material selection are hardness, ductility and \nreactivity with the workpiece material. The tool \nhardness is important in mitigating surface erosion due \nto interaction with particulate matter in the workpiece. \nThe brittle nature of ceramics such as pcBN may be \nundesirable if there is a signiﬁcant probability  of \nbreakage due to vibrations or accidental spikes in \nloads. Tool degradation may be exaggerated if the tool \nmaterial and workpiece react to form undesirable \nphases.  \n \n3. Commonly used Tool materials \n \n3.1 Tungsten based tools \n \nCommercially pure tungsten ( cp-W) is strong at \nelevated temperatures but has poor toughness at \nambient temperature, and wears rapidly when used as \na tool material for FSW of steels and titanium alloys. It \nis known that exposure of cp -W to temperatures in \nexcess of 1473 K causes it to recrystallise and embrittle \non cooling to ambient temperature. Addition of \nrhenium reduces the ductile to brittle transition \ntemperature by inﬂuencing the Peierls stress for \ndislocation motion. This led to the development of \ntungsten–rhenium alloys, with W–25 wt -% Re as a \ncandidate material for FSW tools, and more recently, a \nvariant of this reinforced with 2% of HC. Steels and \ntitanium alloys are successfully welded by W –25 wt -\n%Re tool. Tungsten carbide (WC) based tools have also \nbeen exploited in investi gations of the feasibility of \nFSW of steel and titanium alloys. The toughness of WC \nis said to be excellent and the hardness is 1650 HV. The \nmaterial is apparently also insensitive to sudden \nchanges in temperature and load during welding trials. \n \n3.2 Tool Steel \n \nMaterials such as aluminium or magnesium alloys, and \naluminium matrix composites (AMCs) are commonly \nwelded using steel tools. Steel tools have also been \nused for the joining of dissimilar materials in both lap \nand butt conﬁgurations. In butt joint conﬁguration, the \nharder workpiece is often placed on the advancing side \nand the tool is slightly offset from the butt interface \ntowards the softer workpiece. Oil hardened (62 HRC) \nsteel tool has been used to successfully weld Al \n6061z20 vol. -%Al2O3 AMC an d Al 359z20 vol. -% SiC \nAMC. Tool wear during welding of metal matrix \ncomposites is greater when compared with welding of \nsoft alloys due to the presence of hard, abrasive phases \nin the composites. For FSW of AMCs, some studies have \nshown that the tool wear s initially and obtains a self -\noptimised shape after which wear becomes much less \npronounced. This self -optimised ﬁnal shape, which \ndepends on the process parameters and is generally \n\nAkshansh Mishra et al                        Analysis of Tools used in Friction Stir Welding process                                                                                                                                                                                \n \n1521| International Journal of Current Engineering and Technology, Vol.8, No.6 (Nov/Dec 2018) \n \nsmooth with no threads, can reduce wear when used as \nthe initial tool sha pe. Total wear was found to increase \nwith rotational speed and decrease at lower traverse \nspeed, which suggests that process parameters can be \nadjusted to increase tool life. \n \n3.3 Polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (pcBN) tools \n \nOwing to high strength and  hardness at elevated \ntemperatures along with high temperature stability, \npcBN is a preferred tool material for FSW of hard alloys \nsuch as steels and Ti alloys. Furthermore, the low \ncoefﬁcient of friction for pcBN results in smooth weld \nsurface. However, d ue to high temperatures and \npressures required in the manufacturing of pcBN, the \ntool costs are very high. Owing to its low fracture \ntoughness, pcBN also has a tendency to fail during the \ninitial plunge stage. Maximum weld depths with pcBN \ntools are curren tly limited to 10 mm for welding of \nsteels and Ti alloys. Boron nitride has two crystal \nstructures, the hexagonal and cubic varieties. The \nhexagonal form has a layered structure and hence is \nmore suited as a lubricant. The cubic (zinc blende \nstructure) form is usually pre - pared by subjecting the \nhexagonal version to high temperatures and pressures, \nsimilar to what is followed in producing diamond from \ngraphite. The cubic form is second in hardness only to \ndiamond and has greater thermal and chemical \nstability than carbon. The phase is also chemically inert \nto iron, reportedly even up to 1573 K. Like diamond, \npcBN has a high thermal conductivity which helps \navoid the development of hot spots on tools. A high \nthermal conductivity also helps in the design of l iquid \ncooled tools. The best properties are obtained with \nsingle phase cubic boron nitride (cBN), produced \nwithout using any binder. Such a material can be \nprepared by sintering commercially pure hexagonal \nboron nitride at high pressures (6 –8 GPa) and \ntemperatures (1773–2673 K). \n \n4. Types of Tools \n \nIn Friction Stir Welding process there are three \ndifferent types of Tools i.e. Self -reacting, fixed and \nadjustable as shown in the Figure 3.  \n         \n \n \nFigure 3: a) Fixed Tool, b) Adjustable tool, c) Self-\nreacting Tool \n \nIn fixed probe tool, shoulder and probe constitute a \nsingle unit. Due to fixed probe length, this tool can weld \na workpiece which has a constant thickness. This tool \nundergoes whole replacement in the case of wear or \nbreaks. While in ad justable tooling system there are \ntwo independent components i.e. separate probe and \nthe shoulder. There are two main advantages in using \nthe adjustable tooling system. Firstly, for fabricating \nthis tool separate tool shoulder and probe can be used \nwhich a re manufactured from different materials. In \ncase of the wear or break, the probe can be easily \nreplaced. Secondly, workpieces of variable and \nmultiple gauge thickness can be easily welded using \nadjustable tooling system. It should be noted that both \nthe f ixed and adjustable tooling system requires a \nbacking anvil. The self -reacting tool for example the \nbobbin type tool constitutes three parts i.e. tool probe, \ntop shoulder and bottom shoulder  (W. M. Thomas , \n2001; M. Skinner , 2003) . Multiple gauge thickness can \nbe accommodated by this tool due to the adjustable \nprobe length between the top and bottom shoulder  (G. \nSylva, 2004; F. Marie, 2004). It should be kept in mind \nthat the fixed and adjustable tooling system can be \ntilted laterally and longitudinally whil e the bobbin type \ntooling system can work only perpendicular to the \nworkpiece.  \n \n5. Shapes of Tool probe  \n \nThe tool probe governs the tool travel speed and \ndeformation (W. M. Thomas , 1991). The deformational \nand frictional heating is produced by the tool p robe. \nThe main function of the tool probe is to shear the \nmaterial in front of the tool offers the disruption to the \ncontacting surfaces of the workpiece. As shown in the \nFigure 3, the end shape of the probe is either domed or \nflat. \n The most commonly used  shape in Friction stir \nwelding proc ess is flat bottom probe design ( T. W. \nNelson, 2000; B. London , 2003) . But the main \ndisadvantage of the flat probe is the high forge force \nduring plunging. In contrast, a round or domed end \nshape can reduce the forge for ce and tool wear upon \nplunging, increase tool life by eliminating local stress \nconcentration and improve the quality of the weld root \ndirectly at the bottom of the probe  (C. J. Dawes , 1995). \nNowadays, cylindrical probes have been widely used \nfor joining pl ates up to 12 mm thick plates. In case of \nthe tapered probe, the higher frictional heat increases \nthe plastic deformation because of the larger contact \narea of the probe with the workpiece. The tapered \nprobe also promotes a high hydrostatic pressure in the  \nweld zone  (R. W. Fonda , 2004) which is extremely \nimportant for enhancing the material stirring and the \nnugget integrity. \n The probe outer surfaces can have different shapes \nand features including threads, flats or flutes. \nThreadless probes are chosen for high strength or \nhighly abrasive alloys as the threaded features can be \neasily worn away. The addition of flat features can \nchange material movement around a probe. This is due \nto the increased local deformation and turbulent flow \nof the plasticised material by the flats acting as paddles  \n(W. M. Thomas , 1996) . It is also found that, reduction \nin transverse force and tool torque was directly \nproportional to the number of the flats placed on a \ntapered shoulder (K. J. Colligan, 2003). \n\nAkshansh Mishra et al                        Analysis of Tools used in Friction Stir Welding process                                                                                                                                                                                \n \n1522| International Journal of Current Engineering and Technology, Vol.8, No.6 (Nov/Dec 2018) \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Various tool probe profiles in Friction Stir Welding process \n \n \n \nFigure 5: Design of Tool shoulder used in Friction Stir Welding \n \nThe flats on the probe act as the cutting edge of a \ncutter. The material is trapped in the flats and then \nreleased behind the tool, promoting more effective \nmixing. The addition of the f lats also increases the \ntemperature and nugget area. \n \n6. Shapes of Tool Shoulder \n \nTool shoulders are designed to frictionally heat the \nsurface regions of the workpiece, produce the \ndownward forging action necessary for welding \nconsolidation and constrain the heated metal beneath \nthe bottom shoulder surface. Figure 5, summarises the \ntypical shoulder outer surfaces, the bottom end \nsurfaces and the end features. The shoulder outer \nsurface usually has a cylindrical shape, but \noccasionally, a conical surface is also used. Generally, it \nis expected that the shape of the shoulder outer surface \n(cylindrical or conical) has an insignificant influence on \nthe welding quality because the shoulder plunge depth \nis typically small (i.e. 1–5% of the gauge thickness). \n The sound welds can be obtained using a probe free \nshoulder tool in which the bottom sc rolled shoulder \nsurface feature played a significant role in stirring the \nmaterials. In this case, the shoulder outer surface shape \nand feature may also become important. \n As demonstrated in Figure 5, three types of \nshoulder end surfaces are typically used .5 Of these, the \nflat shoulder end surface is the simplest design. The \nmain disadvantage of this design is that the flat \n\nAkshansh Mishra et al                        Analysis of Tools used in Friction Stir Welding process                                                                                                                                                                                \n \n1523| International Journal of Current Engineering and Technology, Vol.8, No.6 (Nov/Dec 2018) \n \nshoulder end surface is not effective for trapping the \nflowing metal material under the bottom shoulder, \nleading to the production of e xcessive material flash. \nTo this end, a concave shoulder end surface was \ndesigned and has now become popular for restricting \nmaterial extrusion from the sides of the shoulder.  \n Another possible end shape of the shoulder is a \nconvex profile. Early attempts  at TWI for the convex \nend surface were unsuccessful because the convex \nprofile was determined to push the material away from \nthe probe. However, it was reported that a smooth \nconvex end surface shoulder with a 5 mm diameter \nwas successfully used to weld 4  mm thick AZ31 Mg \nalloy sheets, inevitable because of the thin gauge \nthickness (i.e. ,1 mm) for which the end shape of the \nshoulder becomes insignificant. Although the main \nadvantage of the convex shoulder profile is that it can \nattain contact with the wor kpiece at any location along \nthe convex end surface, and thereby, accommodate \ndifferences in flatness or thickness between the two \nadjoining workpieces, the inability of the smooth end \nsurface to prevent material displacement away from \nprobe causes weld integrity issues. \n \n7. Contemporary Tool design in Friction Stir \nWelding \n \nA variety of tool designs have been developed in order \nto improve the material flow and to reduce the \nrequired axial welding forces, which would ultimately \nlead to improved weld quality, reduced energy costs \nand increased utilization of the FSW process. Following \nare a few examples: \n \n7.1 The Skew Stir FSW Tool \n \nIt was developed at TWI in which the shoulder face is \noblique to the axis of the tool probe but normal to the \naxis of the  machine spindle as shown in Figure 6. The \nprobe is cut from one side to make it asymmetrical, \nwhich improves material flow. Use of this technique \nincreases the proportion of the dynamic volume \nrelative to the static volume of the weld. This ratio is \nsignificant in reducing void formation in the weld. Also, \nbecause a larger volume is stirred, this tool is better \nsuited for FS processing. The following figure shows \nthe principle of operation of a Skew-Stir™ tool.  \n \n \n \nFigure 6: Skew Stir FSW Tool \n7.2 The Triflute™ tool  \n \nIt was recently developed at TWI. Like the Skew -Stir \ntool, the dynamic to static volume ratio is higher than \nthat for a conventional tool (2.6:1 as opposed to 1:1). \nInvestigations at TWI have shown that use of the \nTriflute tool gave a 100 % increase in traverse rate and \na 20% reduction in the axial force. \n \n \n \nFigure 7: Triflute tooling system \n \nFurthermore, the upper plate thinning (due to tool \nplunging required to achieve defect -free welds) was \nreduced by factor of 4. Above figure shows a design of \nthis tool.  \n \n7.3 The Whorl™ tool  \n \nIt was developed at TWI and consists of a scoop -\nshaped shoulder with a tapered, frustum -shaped probe \nwhich has a helical ridge with side flats which auger \nplasticized material downwards. For enhancing \nmaterial flow, it is preferred that the distance between \neach ridge is greater than the thickness of the ridge \nitself. Some variants of this tool have a progressively \ndecreasing pitch. This tool enables welding of thick \nsectioned alloys (25 to 75mm) in a single pass since it \nprovides better frictional heating and material flow \ndue to the design of the probe. The following  figure \nshows variants of the Whorl™ tool.  \n \nConclusions \n \nAlthough significant efforts have been made in the \nrecent past to develop cost effective and reusable tools, \nmost of the efforts have been empirical in nature and \nfurther work is needed for improvement in tool design \nto advance the practice of FSW to hard alloys. Heat \ngeneration rate and plastic flow in the workpiece are \naffected by the shape and size of the tool shoulder and \npin. Although the tool design affects weld properties, \ndefects and the forces on the tool, they are currently \ndesigned empirically by trial and error. Work on the \nsystematic design of tools using scientific principles is \njust beginning. \n\nAkshansh Mishra et al                        Analysis of Tools used in Friction Stir Welding process                                                                                                                                                                                \n \n1524| International Journal of Current Engineering and Technology, Vol.8, No.6 (Nov/Dec 2018) \n \nReferences \n \nW.
