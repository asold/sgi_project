    "abstract": "Many developers rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate software\\ndevelopment. Nevertheless, these models have exhibited limited capabilities in\\nthe security domain. We introduce LLMSecGuard, a framework to offer enhanced\\ncode security through the synergy between static code analyzers and LLMs.\\nLLMSecGuard is open source and aims to equip developers with code solutions\\nthat are more secure than the code initially generated by LLMs. This framework\\nalso has a benchmarking feature, aimed at providing insights into the evolving\\nsecurity attributes of these models.\\n",
