    "abstract": "Partial discharges (PD) measurement is a well-known technique for judgment of the condition of power transformer offline. Phase-resolved PD measurement is a normalized technique for PD tests, but noise, especially by PD-measurements onsite is sometimes difficult to reject, and a post-processing of a pattern is necessary to separate different sources. Higher-frequency-detection devices and processing strategies are useful for PD classification and identification. Recently, ultra-high-frequency (UHF) detection by means of antennas has been shown to be a promising detection system for both offline and online PD-measurements. However, it is necessary to assess whether PD source separation and classification is possible by means of pulse analysis because some additional UHF noise sources are coupled to the detected signals, and it is not clear whether different sources produce different pulses. In this study, the attenuation effect of the metallic tank of a power transformer on the inner PD activity when measured outside the tank was studied. Additionally, experiments were conducted to detect and characterize two different PD sources (internal and external discharges) using two antennas measuring the same phenomenon inside and outside of a transformer. It will also be shown that broadband UHF signals are useful for PD recognition and that a deep study of frequencies below 500 MHz can separate PD occurring inside from those occurring outside when measured with an antenna outside the tank.",
