It is becoming more challenging for crop sci -\nence to feed the world’s fast growing population, which \nis expected to be over 9 billion by 2050, under the con\n-\ndition of less land, water and more fluctuating climate \nconditions [2, 3]. Enhancing major crop quality through \nbreeding programs, such as breeding elite varieties with \nincreased yield, improved nutrition and strengthened \nresistance, is critical for a sufficient, reliable and sustain\n-\nable world food supply [4, 5]. Therefore, to identify and \ncharacterize genes related to these important traits is \nimportant for understanding the genetic basis that causes \nthe different phenotypes and breeding modern rice culti\n-\nvars with higher yield, stress/disease resistance and rice \nqualities.\nThe advance of next generation sequencing (NGS) \ntechnologies has greatly improved the speed and accu\n-\nracy of resequencing a large number of genomes, which \nfacilitated the study of rice functional genomics and \nOpen Access\nPlant Methods\n*Correspondence:  hycen@zju.edu.cn \n1 College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang \nUniversity, Hangzhou 310058, People’s Republic of China\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nPage 2 of 16Sun et al. Plant Methods           (2019) 15:54 \nmolecular breeding [6, 7]. In addition, Genome-wide \nassociation study (GWAS) is becoming a powerful tool \nto bridge genotyping and phenotyping, since it rapidly \nidentifies genes associated with phenotypic traits based \non SNP markers, which has been applied extensively to \ndissect rice phenotypic traits [8, 9]. However, there is \nstill a huge gap between phenotyping and genotyping, \nbecause the development of phenotyping is much slower \ncompared to genotyping. There are mainly three reasons: \nFirstly, acquiring traditional agronomic traits is time-con\n-\nsuming and labor-intensive [10]. Secondly, these traits \nare biased due to a lack of international standards for the \nphenotypic trait measurement [11]. Thirdly, it is challeng\n-\ning to obtain high-quality phenotypic data, select suitable \npopulation size and study the extent of linkage disequi\n-\nlibrium (LD), as long as low structured populations are \nprovided [12, 13]. Rice has different phenotypic traits, \nsuch as physical and bio-chemical characteristics, growth \nperformances and biotic/abiotic stress tolerance [13–15]. \nMany agronomic traits have been applied to investi\n-\ngate rice phenotypes, including physical characteristics \nsuch as size, color, shape and texture, or the biochemi\n-\ncal attributes such as protein, starch, gel consistency, and \naroma [16]. Traditionally, phenotyping methods for rice \nvarieties, like High Performance Liquid Chromatogra\n-\nphy (HPLC), Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometer \n(GC–MS), and other biochemical processes provided by \nthe national rice identification facilities are expensive, \ntime consuming and labor intensive [17–19]. As a con\n-\nsequence, these methods can only be applied to a small \nnumber of samples unless a great amount of labor, time \nand funding is invested, which has limited the develop\n-\nment of the phenotyping process. Therefore, developing a \nrapid method for high throughput phenotyping is neces\n-\nsary for both phenomics and genomics. Compared with \ntraditional methods of acquiring phenotypic traits, high \nthroughput non-destructive phenotyping is of higher effi\n-\nciency, accuracy and more standardized. In addition, it is \nmore cost-effective compared with traditional means of \nacquiring agronomic traits in the long run.\nHyperspectral technology has been greatly applied in \nplant phenotyping including biochemical attributes such \nas estimating the canopy water content [20], assessing \nrice leaf growth [21], determining the rice panicle con\n-\ndition [22] and detecting the severity of damage caused \nby insects and bacteria [23–25]. It was also applied for \nevaluating physical characteristics of plants such as the \nfirmness, elasticity, touch resistance of grapes [26]. Feng \net al. used a High-throughput hyperspectral imaging sys\n-\ntem (HHIS) to acquire hyperspectral data for the evalua -\ntion of the growth of plants [14]. However, hyperspectral \nimaging system are usually heavy, large in size, compli\n-\ncated to operate and the data acquired was redundant. \nFurthermore, the indices they obtained were agronomical \ntraits, including Dry weight, Green leaf area and Chloro\n-\nphyll content, instead of biochemical attributes of rice \nquality. The ASD FieldSpec4 Hi-Res spectroradiometer \nis faster and has wider spectrum range (350–2500  nm), \nwhich has been commonly used for soil mineral condi\n-\ntions [27], discriminating different plant species [28], rice \ncrop phenology [29] and biochemical content quantifica\n-\ntion [30] etc.\nBiochemical contents are one essential rice seed \nparameter that is used for grading rice quality, and it was \ntime-consuming, labor intensive and expensive to meas\n-\nure, so in order to achieve high throughput phenotyping \nfor genetic studies on rice seed quality, such as molecu\n-\nlar breeding programs and functional genome study, we \nattempted to investigate the possibility of using hyper\n-\nspectral traits extracted from an ASD FieldSpec4 Hi-Res \nspectroradiometer for GWAS analysis to identify SNP \nmarkers and genes that are related to the represented \nbiochemical traits in this research. To our knowledge, \nthere are no published studies that have applied hyper\n-\nspectral indices of any biochemical contents related to \nrice quality in GWAS.\nIn our study, we attempt to extract hyperspectral indi\n-\nces representing biochemical contents that could be used \nfor GWAS analysis, which had never been reported in \nany published research. The objects of this study were \n(1) to select hyperspectral indices that could represent \nthe according biochemical trait, (2) using the selected \nhyperspectral variables as substitutions of biochemi\n-\ncal measurements of rice to achieve high-throughput \nphenotyping for genetic studies and verify the results of \nGWAS on the extracted hyperspectral indices by com\n-\nparing the identified SNP markers, Genes and pathways \nwith those of biochemical traits. Eventually through this \nstudy, we hope to introduce a possible high throughput \nplant phenotyping method of biochemical contents that \ncould be used in genetic studies based on hyperspectral \ntechnology.\nMethods\nPlant materials\nSeeds of eighty cultivated rice accessions (including 56 \nJaponica type rice and 24 Indica type rice) were grown \nin an experimental rice field at Rice Breeding Research \nStation in Jiaxing Academy of Agricultural Sciences, \nZhejiang Province, China (N30°50′ 5″E120°42′59″). The \nrice field was allocated into 80 rice plots, with each \nrice variety grown in one rice plot. Rice seeds from five \nplants of each rice variety, 400 samples in total were \ncollected for 9 phenotypic traits as designed (Table  1). \nAfter harvesting, rice seeds were collected and dried by \nnatural air-drying method before being put in labeled \nPage 3 of 16\nSun et al. Plant Methods           (2019) 15:54 \npaper sample bags and sent to Key Laboratory of Spec -\ntroscopy Sensing (KLSS) at Zhejiang University. All rice \nseed varieties were listed in Additional file 1 : Table S1. \nBiochemical components measurement\nAir-dried rice seeds were sent to China National Rice \nResearch Institute (CNRRI), Zhejiang province, China, \nto measure 4 biochemical components that were impor\n-\ntant for rice quality determination basted on national \nrice standards NY/T593, including Crude Protein Con\n-\ntent (PC), Amylose Content (AC), Gel consistency (GC) \nand Alkali Spreading Value (ASV) (Table 1). The detailed \ndescription of the analytical workflow chart for this study \nwas summarized in Fig.  1. In order to verify the valida\n-\ntion of the dataset during statistical analysis, the follow -\ning criterion was applied: if the data was not normally \ndistributed, the dataset was not accepted. The biochemi\n-\ncal components that didn’t meet the aforementioned \ncriterion will not be used for further correlation analy\n-\nsis. Eventually, the traits with an acceptable coefficient \ncovariant and normalized distribution were subjected to \nhyperspectral trait extraction and Pearson correlation \nanalysis for GWAS analysis.\nTable 1 Summary of trait categories\nCategory Names Acronym\nBiochemical traits Amylose content (%) AC\nGel consistency GC\nCrude protein content (%) PC\nAlkali spreading value ASV\nHyperspectral traits Reflectance at wavelength 1177 (nm) R1177\nReflectance at wavelength 1227 (nm) R1227\nNormalized Differential Spectral Index NDSI\nDifferential Spectral Index DSI\nSimple Ratio Index SRI\nFig. 1 Schematic overview of the primary procedures of extracting hyperspectral traits for GWAS\nPage 4 of 16Sun et al.

The spectral resolu\n-\ntion is 3 nm @ 700 nm, 8 nm @ 1400/2100 nm with sam -\npling intervals (bandwidths) of 1.4  nm @ 350–1000  nm \n1.1 nm @ 1001–2500 nm. Rice grains were put in a petri \ndish (diameter: 8  cm). The sensor of spectroradiometer \nwas fixed vertically down to the opposite to the center \nof the sample by a detachable rack system and the height \nbetween the spectroradiometer sensor and rice sample in \npetri dish was 20.7 cm. The light source was a 50 W halo\n-\ngenate lamp, which was 27.4 cm in height and 60 degree \nfrom the sample surface. The details of the hyperspectral \ndata acquisition system and the spectral data acquisi\n-\ntion process are shown in Additional file  2: Fig.  S1. For \neach rice variety, rice seeds of 5 plants were collected and \npooled together. Around 3 grams of rice seeds were used \nto collected hyperspectral data. Each sample was manu\n-\nally loaded to acquire spectral data by spectroradiometer. \nThe reflectance of all rice seeds from each sample that \nwere within the vision field of spectroradiometer was \nacquired during each reading. For each sample, the spec\n-\ntral acquisition process was repeated 3 times by the spec -\ntroradiometer automatically, before they were averaged \nto represent the sample’s mean spectral reflectance. The \ndata was analyzed on the Matlab software 2014a platform \n(Matlab works, USA).\nHyperspectral data process and analysis\nThe hyperspectral data process followed published pro -\ntocols with minor changes [31–33]. The acquired hyper -\nspectral data was calibrated by the following equation:\nHere, Ical, Iraw, Iwhite and I dark represented calibrated \nreflectance intensity, original intensity, white reference \nintensity and dark current, respectively. I dark was col -\nlected by the spectroradiometer automatically; I white was \nmeasured using a white Teflon tile with reflectance close \nto 100%. Data before 400  nm and after 2450  nm was \nremoved due to the low signal-to-noise ratio before they \nwere used for further analysis.\nAfter calibration, the data were applied for the follow\n-\ning analysis. The average spectrum of all samples was \nextracted. Three indices including Simple Ratio Index \n(SRI), Normalized Difference Spectral Index (NDSI) and \nDifferential Spectral Index (DSI) were induced for the \ncorrelation analysis and as a means to select the optimal \nwavelength combination for biochemical components. \n(1)Ical = Iraw − Idark\nIwhite − Idark\nThese three indices were used because a number of \nresearch had reported normalized difference vegetation \nindex derived indices could be used to estimate biochem\n-\nical components such as protein content of rice based on \nthe hyperspectral data from rice canopy [34–37]. The for\n-\nmulas are listed below:\nHere, Ra and R b stand for reflectance of two different \nwavelengths in each formula, respectively. The optimal \nwave lengths were selected by the following procedure. \nReflectance of two random wavelengths was used in the \naforementioned formulas to calculate the value of SRI, \nNDSI and DSI respectively, until all the wavelength com\n-\nbinations were applied. The resulting SRI, NDSI and DSI \nwere then subjected to Pearson correlation analysis. The \nindex of the best performance (the highest the determi\n-\nnation coefficient) was selected as the hyperspectral trait \nfor the according biochemical component.\nSampling, re‑sequencing and sequencing data process\nOne fresh leaf from each rice variety was collected for \nnext generation sequencing. Leaf samples were wrapped \nin aluminum foil and put in liquid nitrogen for 2 h, prior \nto being stored at − 80  °C overnight before re-sequenc\n-\ning. Sample Re-sequencing was performed on the Illu -\nmina HiSeq X Ten platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, \nCA, USA). Raw sequencing data was first processed with \nsoftware Illumina Casava 1.8. Raw data was filtered for \ncleaner reads before further analysis. The filtering pro\n-\ncess includes the deletion of the adapter sequences, reads \nwith over 10% N contents and reads with over 50% nucle\n-\notides whose quality score was lower than 10. The quality \nscore of nucleotides was calculated using the following \nformula:\nwhere e stands for the sequencing error rate, Qphred rep\n-\nresents the quality score of nucleotides.\nThe BWA software [38] was used for the alignment of \nresulted clean reads. Oryza sativa_IRGSP_1.0 was used \nas the reference genome which is available on the web -\nsite of National Center for Biotechnology Information \n(NCBI). The sequencing depth, genome coverage, and \nother information of each sample were collected through \nthe alignment process, and mutations were called.\n(2)SRI = Ra\nRb\n(3)NDSI = Ra − Rb\nRa + Rb\n(4)DSI = Ra − Rb\n(5)Qphred =− 10log10(e)\nPage 5 of 16\nSun et al. Plant Methods           (2019) 15:54 \nSNP detection and annotation\nThe detection of SNPs was achieved mainly using GATK \n[39] software toolkit. Briefly, the main detection process \nincludes: (1) Picard’s Mark Duplicate tool was used to \nremove duplicates and mask the effects of PCR-duplica\n-\ntion of the resulted clean reads. (2) InDel Realignment \nwas performed using GATK. During this process, local \nre-alignment was performed to correct the errors caused \nby the insertion deletion during the aliment process. (3) \nBase recalibration was performed using GATK to cali\n-\nbrate the SNP quality. (4) Variant calling using GATK, \nmainly includes SNP and InDel. (5) Strict SNP filtration \nwas performed based on the following criteria: SNP clus\n-\nter filtering (if there were 2 SNPs within 5 bp, they were \nfiltered out), SNP filtering near Indel (SNPs within 5 bp \nnear Indel were filtered out); and adjacent InDel filtering \n(if two Indels’ distance is less than 10  bp, they were fil\n-\ntered out) [40].\nPhylogenetic analysis and population‑structure study\nA neighbor-joining tree of all rice accessions was con -\nstructed using MEGA5 software [41] based on the SNP \nmarkers and neighbor-joining algorithm (p-distance \nmodel with 1000 bootstrap). Based on the high-consist\n-\nent SNP , the population structure of the samples was \nanalyzed using admixture software [42]. A population \nstructure map was constructed with the hypothesized \nK-value set from 1 to 15. A clustering process was per\n-\nformed, and the clustering results were cross-validated. \nThe optimal clustering number was determined accord\n-\ning to the minimum value of the cross-validation error \nrate. Based on SNPs, EIGENSOFT software [43] was \nused to perform Principal components analysis (PCA) \nanalysis to cluster samples based on the first three prin\n-\ncipal components. The SPAGeDi software [44] was used \nto estimate the relative kinship of populations. Link\n-\nage disequilibrium analysis was performed using Plink2 \nsoftware [45] to calculate the linkage disequilibrium \nbetween SNPs within a distance of 1000 kb on the same \nchromosome.\nGenome‑wide association study (GWAS)\nThe resulted SNPs (minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥ 0.05) \nwas used for the following GWAS with the selected bio -\nchemical and hyperspectral traits. The GWAS analysis \nwas performed using the mixed linear model (MLM) of \nTASSEL software [46]. The formula for the mixed linear \nmodel is as follows:\nHere, Q stands for the population structure calculated \nusing admixture software, K stands for kinship of samples \n(6)y= X α + Q β + K µ + e\nfrom SPAGeDi software. X is the genotype while y stands \nfor phenotype. The genome-wide significance thresh -\nolds of all tested traits were evaluated with Bonferroni \ncorrection:\nHere, n stands for the effective number of independent \nSNPs. Bonferroni correction was applied here to control \nthe type I error genome-wide. The P value threshold for \nsignificance in the Oryza sativa population was set to be \np = 3.788e−09 and p = 3.788e−09 (suggestive and sig\n-\nnificant, respectively) for the studied population. In this \nstudy, only the associations that exceeded the significant \nP-value threshold were considered. The extent of local \nLD was evaluated for each selected significant SNP to \ndetermine the interval of each locus.\nGene annotation and comparison\nFunctional annotation analysis of genes in the associ -\nated regions was performed using different databases \nincluding NCBI non-redundant (NR), The Gene Ontol\n-\nogy (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Kyoto \nEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway \nanalysis. A gene was annotated based on the principle \nthat at least 2 databases provided the annotation descrip\n-\ntion. Further validation of candidate genes was obtained \nby manually screening based on published research \nand gene function descriptions of the aforementioned \ndatabases.\nResults and discussion\nBiochemical traits acquisition\nTable 2 shows the summary of the statistics of the phe -\nnotypic trait data. Figure  2 shows the frequency distribu -\ntions of the phenotypic traits. Most of these traits were \nquantitative and continuous, which suggested that there \nmight be a complex genetic influence, except ASV, which \nwas not continuous (Fig.  2). Based on the general trends \nof other traits, almost all the other traits were roughly \nnormally distributed.\n(7)P = 0.01\nn\nTable 2 Summary statistics for biochemical traits\na CV of ASV and AC are high (≥ 15%)\nMin Max Mean SD CV\nASV (mm) 3.70 7.00 6.13 0.89 0.15a\nGC (mm) 42.00 82.00 64.94 6.94 0.11\nAC (%) 8.30 20.10 14.20 2.11 0.15a\nPC (%) 7.40 10.50 8.62 0.77 0.09\nPage 6 of 16Sun et al. Plant Methods           (2019) 15:54 \nASV and AC are two of the multidimensional charac -\nteristics relating to rice grain quality that has been used \nworldwide in rice breeding and process technologies. \nThe degree of degradation test was evaluated visually \nby inspectors which was graded by a range of scores \nfrom 1 to 7. Since a number of the ASV scores of the \nrice collection reached maximum measurement limit, \nwhich was 7, the distribution of ASV value was not nor\n-\nmalized and heavily skewed, thus not suitable for Pear -\nson Correlation analysis. Therefore, it was not selected \nfor the following Pearson correlation analysis. ASV \nis the inverse indicator of the gelatinization tempera\n-\nture (GT) of rice starch granules [47], which is closely \nrelated to rice cooking behavior and sensory properties \ndue to crystalline melting and starch solubilisation dur\n-\ning cooking process. ASV is also related to AC, there -\nfore, it can be observed in Table  2 that AC has a similar \nhigh CV (≥  15%) as ASV. The CV of ASV and AC were \nvery high (≥  15%), which means these data sets had a \nhigher dispersion. It could be caused by severe differ -\nences between the content of these biochemical traits. \nA Pearson Correlation analysis was conducted for \nhyperspectral traits and biochemical traits including \nPC, AC and GC.\nHyperspectral data analysis and hyperspectral traits \nextraction\nOverall, the data size of hyperspectral data from the \nspectrometer was 6.5  MB. Based on the summary of \nPearson correlation analysis of GC, AC and PC with \nall three hyperspectral indices shown in Table  3, GC \nand AC had low determination coefficient with all \nthree hyperspectral indices (R\n2\nSRI = 0.21, R 2\nNDSI = 0.21 \nand R 2\nDSI = 0.26 for GC; R 2\nSRI = 0.24, R 2\nNDSI = 0.24 and \nR2\nDSI = 0.31 for AC), while PC showed high determina -\ntion coefficient with all three indices, especially NDSI \nR\n2\nNDSI = 0.68. Therefore, NDSI was selected for the final \nGWAS analysis as a hyperspectral trait for PC. The cor -\nrelation between hyperspectral data and biochemical \ntraits of AC and GC were low  (R\n2 < 0.6). This might be \nbecause that due to a relatively small sample size and \nlarge dispersed data set of AC, the correlation between \nhyperspectral traits and AC became low. In order to \nconstruct a hyperspectral index that could be applied \nfor AC, a bigger sample size would be selected in the \nfuture. In addition, because the GC is a complex trait \nand the nature of the GC data set was not a measure\n-\nment of the content of a certain chemical/compound, \nbut the length of flow distance [48], which makes it not \nFig. 2 Frequency distribution for all the traits. AC, PC, and GC fit normalized distribution, except for ASV, which is heavily right skewed due to many \nrice accessions reached the maximum measurement limit\nPage 7 of 16\nSun et al. Plant Methods           (2019) 15:54 \nsuitable for hyperspectral technology, because hyper -\nspectral signal was relating to the resonance of cer -\ntain chemical bonds [25]. There is not any published \nresearch on using hyperspectral technology to dissect \nGC of rice seeds. In addition, it was reported that the \naccuracy of the algorism developed for the extraction \nof phenotypic traits using phenotyping platforms is \ngreatly affected by the sample size [49, 50]. At the same \nlevel of other effects, as the sample size increased, the \ndegree of freedom of the test increased and the result\n-\ning P-value became more significant [51– 53].\nEventually, PC was selected for hyperspectral analysis \nand GWAS. Two optimal wavelengths were selected for \nthe biochemical trait PC based on formula  3. Figure  3a \nshows the mean spectra all rice accessions. The results \nof correlation analysis indicated that NDSI had high \ncorrelation with PC (R\n2\nNDSI = 0.68) (Fig. 3b).\nGenome sequencing and assembly\nSequencing results showed that approximately 12-fold \ncoverage was achieved, generating a total of 419.53 Gbp \nclean data, with Q30 up to 94.65%. Detailed sequencing \ndata statistics was listed in Additional file  3: Table S2. \nThe average matching ratio between the sample and \nthe reference genome was 98.81%, and the genome \ncoverage was 96.79% (at least one base coverage) when \nmapped on the reference genome. Only SNP mark\n-\ners with minimum allele frequency (MAF) higher than \n0.05 were selected for further analysis. Eventually, a \ntotal of 3,398,019 SNP loci and 773,337 Indel loci were \nidentified in this study. The multiple test corrections \nget more severity as the number of sequencing cases \nincreases. Due to the increase in the depth of sequenc\n-\ning, the marker density is continuously increasing, and \nthe severity of the test is also increasing [51]. Here, \nthe sequencing depth reached 12 × which relatively \nimproved the chance of accurate SNP loci identifica\n-\ntion. Together with strict SNP and gene screening, fil -\ntering and gene function profiling, the resulted SNP/\ngene loci using hyperspectral traits extracted from \nhyperspectral data in the GWAS analysis could be more \nspecific and accurate.\nPhylogenetic analysis and population‑structure study\nThe neighbor-joining tree of all rice varieties is shown in \nFig. 4a. Figure  4b shows the result of PCA analysis using \n2 principle components PC1 and PC3. No Clear separa\n-\ntion of subgroups was observed based on components \nPC1 and PC3 (Fig.  4b), which might be due to the pos\n-\nsible complexity of the studied population and potential \ngene flow of each rice variety due to natural and artifi\n-\ncial selection. Therefore, a population structure analysis \nusing ADMIXTURE software was employed to calculate \nthe optimum subgroups for GWAS analysis [54]. Based \non the population structure map (Fig.  4d) and cross-val\n-\nidation (CV) errors, the optimum cluster group number \nin this population was determined to be 6 (Fig.  4c). For \nbetter visualization of each subgroup and their position \non the phylogenic tree, each rice variety subgroup on the \ntree was marked by different colors based on the result \nof population analysis. The linkage disequilibrium decay \ndistance (LDD) of all samples was shown in Fig.  4e. The \nLD50, which was the LDD when the pairwise coefficient \nof determination  (r\n2) dropped to half its maximum value, \nwas applied to evaluate the linkage disequilibrium. The \nlonger LD50 indicated a smaller chance of gene recom -\nbination [55]. On average, it was observed that LD50 of \nall the rice samples was longer than 100 kb, which indi\n-\ncated a small chance of LD [56]. However, the difference \nin LDD between each rice chromosomes suggested com\n-\nplicated gene recombination events within this rice culti -\nvar population (data shown in Additional file  4: Fig. S2). \nThe frequency of kinship-value in all the rice accessions \nwere shown in Fig.  4f. As the kinship value increases, the \nfrequency decreases rapidly, indicating a relatively high \ncomplexity of population structure, and relatively less \nkinship within this population.\nGWAS analysis and candidate gene annotation\nThe threshold of p = 3.788e−09 was used to identify \nSNPs relating to selected traits PC and NDSI. Manhat -\ntan plots and quantile–quantile plots for other traits were \nshown in Additional file 5: Fig. S2. The summary of iden\n-\ntified associated gene numbers for 5 traits were listed in \nTable 4.

NDSI index also detected one SNP position \n7837287 located on chromosome 1 (Table  4), which was \nnot identified by PC trait. Hu et al. [57], reported that in \ntheir study of doubled haploid lines, there were quantita\n-\ntive loci located on chromosome 1. In addition, according \nto Zhang et al. [58] four protein fractions and crude pro\n-\ntein contents were located on chromosome 1 and 2 based \non their study on seventy-one recombinant inbred lines, \nincluding, Albumin, Globulin, Prolamin, Glutelin and \ncrude protein, which is similar to our results.\nSAS3 (OsSAMS3) for S-adenosyl-l-methionine syn\n-\nthetases (SAMS) on chromosome 1 was previously \nrecorded to be important for histone H3K4me3 in rice, \nbecause it regulates the expression of genes related to \nflowering development by DNA methylation. By knock\n-\ning down SAS3, the expression of the flowering key genes \nincluding Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Hd3a and RFT1 \n(rice FT-like genes) were greatly decreased, which lead \nto severe late flowering. This might cause decreasing of \nrice milking stage, which was important for the accu\n-\nmulation of seed nutrition including rice protein con -\ntent [59]. Meanwhile, rice EL5 belongs to an ATL family \ngene, which is characterized by a transmembrane domain \nat the N-terminal and a RING-H2 finger domain (RFD). \nKoiwai et  al. [60, 61] reported that EL5, function as a \nmembrane-anchored E3, was important for the mainte\n-\nnance of cell viability after root primordial formation was \ninitiated. It was a ubiquitously expressed protein in rice, \nwhich could affect rice plant growth status by affect the \ndevelopment of root initiation, thus influence the accu\n-\nmulation of rice nutrition including protein content.\nLD block heatmaps based on the LD of each identified \nSNP loci are shown in Fig.  5c–e. The LD analysis of the \nthree loci showed that these markers had relatively low \nLD parameter  (R\n2 < 0.6) which indicates a relatively low \ncorrelation with each other. These LD regions indicated \nrelatively strong inheritability with their traits accord\n-\ningly, which might not be due to LD block effects.\nPotential candidate gene loci that could be related to \nPC content based on KEGG annotation, GO annota -\ntion and NR annotation (NCBI) were summarized in \nTable 5. These gene loci were identified in a number of \nstudies that have reported functions that might directly \nor indirectly be related to protein content variation. \nOne research reported that glx-1, a glyoxalase gene, \ncould express protein OsGlyI, which might be relating \nto improving abiotic stress tolerance and grain yield in \nrice [74]. During the past few years, more research has \nreported the function of non-coding RNAs and histone \nmodifications on the regulation of transcription, flower\n-\ning periods, rice reproduction, and development of rice \nseeds. Two-component response regulator ORR2 was \nreported to cause rice morphology variation and cyto\n-\nkinin metabolism [70].\nThe basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, a super -\nfamily of TFs, are one of the largest TF families in plants, \nwhich includes 177 bHLH genes in the rice genome. \nThese conserved TFs have a diverse variety of func\n-\ntions in many plant signaling processes that regulates \nthe expression of functional proteins involved in differ\n-\nent biological processes including cell proliferation and \ndifferentiation [75], root development, anthocyanin bio\n-\nsynthesis, plant morphology and fruit pigment accumu -\nlation [76], mineral uptake [77], abiotic stress response \n[78] and seed morphology [79], etc. In the study of pol\n-\nlen development regulation conducted by Ko et  al. [64] \nit was found that bHLH142 played an important role in \npollen development, which could potentially affect the \nflowering date and the development of grains. According \nto Liu, the flowering time was associated with rice seed \nprotein content [80]. Most interestingly, one research \non the wheat grain storage proteins (GSPs) in response \nto nitrogen application reported that 26 differentially \nexpressed genes (DEGs) were related to the accumulation \nTable 4 A subset of  associated loci and  candidate genes \nnumbers according to GWAS analysis for PC and NDSI\na Position in bp; Chr.

In their study, with an increasing level of nitro -\ngen, the GSPs were remarkably increased, while three \nbHLH genes including TFs bHLH-150 were evidently \ndown-regulated 10–25 and 15–35  days after anthesis \n[67]. This research suggests the function of bHLH-150 \nin regulating the accumulation of rice storage protein. It \nindicates that SNP locus sf017837287 identified by NDSI \nbut not PC is related to rice protein content. To further \nvalidate this result, a gene function analysis of bHLH-150 \nin rice would be conduct in the future studies. However, \nthis further illustrates the promising potential of hyper\n-\nspectral traits in GWAS study which is rapid to acquire \nand can identify promising genes while biochemical traits \ncould not. The detailed gene annotations were listed in \nAdditional file 6: Table S3.\nComparison of gene loci identified by biochemical trait PC \nand hyperspectral trait NDSI\nKegg annotation histogram shows that traits PC (Fig.  6a) \nand NDSI (Fig.  6b) annotated exactly 3 same pathways \nincluding Cysteine and methionine metabolism, homol -\nogous recombination and plant hormone signal trans -\nduction. These three pathways are included in three \nbiological processes including, metabolism, genetic \ninformation processing and environmental informa\n-\ntion processing. The cysteine and methionine metabolic \npathway was reported important for biosynthesis and \nmetabolism of some of amino acids/protein, because \nresults of the reported research showed an increase of \ncysteine and glutathione, which was accompanied by an \nincreasing level of free methionine and methionine that \nwas incorporated into water-soluble protein fractions \nin rice seeds. It was noted that there were more isoleu\n-\ncine, leucine, and valine contents in the transgenic lines \nof rice with high activity of cysteine and methionine \nmetabolic pathway [81, 82]. The top hits of the SNP locus \n(Os01g0293000) in NCBI gene bank was annotated to be \nrelated to the biosynthesis of amino acids. Gene function \nanalysis of genes identified by NDSI but not detected by \nPC on chromosome 1 position 7837287 was able to iden\n-\ntify annotated gene bHLH-150 which was reported to be \ninvolved in the regulation of grain storage protein, which \nindicates that NDSI could possibly serve as a substitute \nof PC and identify more genes than PC involved in rice \nprotein content in GWAS.\nThe distribution of pathways and gene loci that were \nidentified by PC and NDSI based on Kegg database were \nsummarized in the Venn diagrams in Fig.  6c, d, respec\n-\ntively. It can be observed from Kegg pathway annota -\ntion, that NDSI was able to locate the same biological \npathway as PC. Meanwhile, in terms of gene numbers, \nNDSI located 65 genes, which covered all the 43 genes \nthat were identified by PC. This result further proofed \nthe accuracy and feasibility of hyperspectral index NDSI \nas a hyperspectral trait that could be used in GWAS as \na substitute of PC. Since the acquisition of NDSI was \ncheaper, less biased from manual measurement, accurate \nin identifying SNPs, and much more rapid, this method is \npotentially a high throughput phenotyping tool in GWAS \nfor protein content of rice quality.\nRapid acquisition of biochemical data by hyperspectral \ntechnology for genetic studies\nTraditionally, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to \nacquire most of the biochemical component traits, but \nusing spectroradiometer we not only obtained stand\n-\nardized phenotypic traits accurately but achieved high-\nthrough, which could be applied to keep up with the \nadvancing speed of genotyping [2, 10]. Since the gap \nbetween the development of phenotyping and genotyp\n-\ning are mainly caused by the lacking of standards as well \nas low efficiency of current phenotyping method [83]. \nThe study of high throughput phenotyping method using \ndifferent sensors, computers and integrated platforms \nTable 5 Subset of potential candidate gene loci related to PC\n#Gene name Chr SNP location Gene description References\nOs01g0242600 1 7837287 C2 domain‑containing protein At1g53590 [62–65]\nOs01g0243400 1 7837287 Transcription factor bHLH150‑like [66, 67]\nOs01g0243700 1 7837287 Glucan endo‑1,3‑beta‑d‑glucosidase [68]\nOs01g0292900 1 10727694 Sphingosine‑1‑phosphate lyase gene OsSPL1(SPL1) [69]\nOs01g0293000 1 10727694 S‑adenosylmethionine synthase 3 (SAS3) [59, 63]\nOs02g0557800 2 21222443 Two‑component response regulator ORR2 [63, 70]\nOs02g0559300 2 21222443 Cyclin‑dependent kinase C‑2‑like; probable serine/threonine‑\nprotein kinase At1g54610\n[62, 63]\nOs02g0560200 2 21222443 E3 ubiquitin‑protein ligase EL5 (EL5) [60, 71–73]\nOs02g0560300 2 21222443 3‑(3‑Hydroxy‑phenyl)propionate/3‑hydroxycinnamic acid \nhydroxylase‑like\nPage 13 of 16\nSun et al.

Optimize the criteria \nfor phenotypic measurement and identification systems \nis of great importance for the advancing of phenotyping. \nPlant phenotypes are determined by the combination of \nplant genotypes and different environment conditions \nwhere the plant grows. Changes of environment condi\n-\ntions are difficult to control and will cause great interfer -\nence. Coupled with the phenotypic measurement bias \ndue to human interference, it will reduce the significance \nof the test. A good solution is to use an automatic phe\n-\nnotype identification system that can effectively reduce \nthe error of manual operation. Strictly following the cri\n-\nteria of processing and selection of phenotypic data set \nis important during the extraction of feasible hyperspec\n-\ntral indices. In order to get the best results, CVs lower \nthan 0.15 and normal data distribution are applied in this \nstudy for the best performance of Pearson correlation \nanalysis and index extraction.\nIn the future study, more hyperspectral traits rep\n-\nresenting different biochemical traits, such as starch, \ncomponents relating to rice fragrance and texture, need \nFig. 6 KEGG enrichment histogram and Vernn diagram. a Pathway association identified using biochemical trait, PC. b Pathway association \nidentified using hyperspectral trait NDSI. c Venn diagrams of pathways identified by PC and NDSI. d Venn diagrams of genes identified by PC and \nNDSI\nPage 14 of 16Sun et al.

Meanwhile, more \ngene function analysis of GWAS on hyperspectral traits \nare needed to fully address the effect of hyperspectral \ntraits in genetic studies. Other information related to this \nresearch is listed in Additional files 7, 8, 9, 10.\nConclusions\nIn this study, we tried to apply high through-put spectro -\nradiometer hyperspectral data to extract hyperspectral \ntraits that were highly related to biochemical attributes \nfor rice quality. One resulted hyperspectral trait NDSI \nwas used for GWAS as an alternative for rice protein \ncontent to investigate the possibility of using hyperspec\n-\ntral trait for genetic study. The results showed that the \napplication of hyperspectral trait NDSI had the potential \nto identify the same genes/pathways as PC and in addi\n-\ntion, NDSI detected one more SNP locus that is related \nto grain protein content which could not be identified by \nPC. In conclusion, hyperspectral traits have the potential \nto be applied to GWAS as an alternative to traditional \ntime-consuming and labor-intensive biochemical com\n-\nponent measurements, which could greatly improve the \nphenotyping speed and decrease bias caused by human \noperation for genetic study. This research provides a \npotential new method to phenotype biochemical traits \nof rice for genetic studies based on the hyperspectral \ntechnology.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.
