    "abstract": "The widespread application of digital technology has triggered profound changes in the field of education, promoting the innovation and transformation of the education model, and international organizations have deeply discussed and given creative suggestions on sensitive topics such as when and how artificial intelligence can be used in education. This paper focuses on the latest norms proposed by UNESCO, the OECD and the EU on the application of AI in education, and compares and analyses them in four dimensions, namely, focusing on the perspective, actual influence, degree of innovation, and focusing on preventing risks. Lastly, the international organizations provide useful references and guidance for the specific field of \"generative AI\", which covering teacher training, educational content standardization, data protection and ethical concerns. The comparison of the education policy recommendations of the three international organizations aims to help governments sort out the similarities and differences between the starting points, concerns and goals of different international organizations, and then clarify the relevance and feasibility of their recommendations.",
