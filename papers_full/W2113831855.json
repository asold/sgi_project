  "full_text": "Can family history be used as a tool for public\nhealth and preventive medicine?\nPaula W. Yoon, ScD, MPH 1, Maren T. Scheuner, MD, MPH 2, Kris L. Peterson-Oehlke, MS, CGC 1,\nMarta Gwinn, MD, MPH 1, Andrew Faucett, MS, CGC 3, and Muin J. Khoury, MD, PhD 1\nMost common chronic diseases are the result of complex\ninteractions between multiple genetic variants and environ-\nmental factors. Despite significant advances in the last decade\nin the understanding of our genome, there are substantial lim-\nitations in epidemiological and analytic approaches to study-\ning the effects of genetic determinants of common chronic\ndiseases. Knowledge of genetic variation underlying disease\nsusceptibility should improve our ability to diagnose, manage,\nand prevent these disorders. To date, however, DNA-based\ntesting is limited for the most part to analysis of highly pene-\ntrant single gene disorders that account for approximately 5%\nof the total disease burden in the population. 1,2 It may be years\nbefore DNA-based tests are routinely applied to predict the\nonset of common diseases, their natural history, and response\nto therapy.\nIn the absence of genetic testing, we postulate that family\nhistory can be used as a tool to stratify risk for common chronic\ndiseases and thereby identify individuals with increased disease\nsusceptibility. Could disease information about people’s close\nrelatives be used to predict their risk for specific diseases? And,\nif this can be done with some degree of reliability, would indi-\nviduals who may be at above average risk benefit from targeted\nprevention and screening programs beyond what is recom-\nmended for the population at large, including DNA-based test-\ning? Further, would individuals found by family history to be at\nincreased risk be more accepting of recommendations about\nlifestyle changes and participation in heightened early detec-\ntion and prevention strategies? The purpose of this paper is to\nintroduce the concept of family history as a public health tool\nfor risk stratification leading to improved disease prevention\nand to describe an evaluation process that would be necessary\nto determine the feasibility, validity, and utility of this\napproach.\nFAMILY HISTORY AS A RISK FACTOR FOR DISEASE\nFamily history of specific diseases reflects the consequences\nof genetic susceptibilities, shared environment, and common\nbehaviors. The scope of family history information ranges\nfrom knowing a parent or sibling had a specific disease to very\ndetailed pedigree analyses about disease and age at onset for\nfirst-, second-, and even third-degree relatives. In some fami-\nlies, highly penetrant genetic mutations are transmitted\nthrough generations, resulting in a high likelihood of disease.\nBreast cancer associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene muta-\ntions is an example of inherited susceptibility where the disease\nrisk is high. 3 Fortunately, these deleterious gene mutations are\nrare in the population. For the majority of families, genetic\nsusceptibility is transmitted through many low penetrant\ngenes that interact with environmental factors to increase the\nrisk for disease. For example, an increasing number of studies\nare showing that polymorphisms for genes that code for car-\ncinogen metabolizing enzymes (e.g., NAT2 and MGMT) can\nincrease the risk of cancer. 4 The difficulty of applying genetic\ntests of such polymorphisms to predict future disease is that\neach gene variant accounts for only a small increase in risk.\nThus, these polymorphisms serve as poor screening tools for\npredicting disease risk within the general population. 5 How-\never, testing for these polymorphisms in individuals with a\nfamily history of disease could further refine risk, because fa-\nmilial clustering of disease typically reflects multifactorial in-\nheritance in which susceptibility is determined by the com-\nbined effects of a number of genes interacting with\nenvironmental and lifestyle factors.\nFamily history has been shown to be a risk factor for a ma-\njority of chronic diseases of public health significance, includ-\ning cardiovascular disease, diabetes, several cancers, osteopo-\nrosis, and asthma (Table 1). Most early cardiovascular-related\nevents (coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and dia-\nbetes) in the population occur in families with a positive family\nhistory of cardiovascular disease. 6 The late Dr. Roger Williams\nand his colleagues conducted extensive studies on the use of\nfamily history information for predicting future risk of coro-\nnary heart disease (CHD). In a large cohort in Utah, they found\nthat having two or more first-degree relatives with CHD iden-\ntified 8% of the population with relative risks of 3.3 to 5.9 for\nCHD before age 50. 7 Generally, family history of a common,\nchronic disease is associated with relative risks ranging from 2\nto 5 times those of the general population. 8 Even greater in-\ncrease in relative risk is associated with an increasing number\nof affected relatives and earlier ages of disease onset.\nEvidence suggests that family history by itself is most useful\nfor predicting disease when there are multiple family members\naffected, the relationship among relatives is close, and disease is\nFrom the 1Office of Genomics and Disease Prevention, National Center for Environmental\nHealth, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia; 2GenRISK Program,\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California; and 3Division of Laboratory Systems,\nPublic Health Practice Program Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta,\nGeorgia.\nPaula W.

Hunt and\ncolleagues developed a family history score that compares a\nfamily’s age- and sex-specific disease incidence to that ex-\npected in the general population and predicts future disease\nincidence in unaffected family members. 7 Scheuner and col-\nleagues proposed a classification system that stratifies risk into\nthree groups: high, moderate, and average (general population\nrisk) (Table 2). This classification took into consideration the\nage of onset of a disease, the number of affected relatives, and\ntheir relationship to the patient. Family history data were col-\nlected on 400 healthy individuals for 8 chronic conditions:\nheart disease, stroke, diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, en-\ndometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer. Most\nindividuals had an average (general population) risk for these\ndisorders, but approximately 5% to 15% of the people were at\nmoderate risk and 1% to 10% were at high risk.9 Silberberg and\ncolleagues reviewed the literature on the methodology used to\ncalculate family history scores for coronary heart disease. 10\nThey evaluated 15 published scores according to several desir-\nable properties of family history scores for common diseas-\nes— a score should: a) consider the risk profile of the family\n(taking into account covariates, such as age, sex, smoking sta-\ntus); b) be robust to family size and time at risk; c) consider\nrelationship of the relatives (close relatives being given more\nweight); and d) not be inflated by a single individual. The au-\nthors concluded that all of the published scores performed\nsimilarly in distinguishing cases and controls and that all for-\nmulations were disadvantaged to the same extent. They recom-\nmended that researchers consider characteristics of their data\nbefore selecting any particular score formulation and that if\nfamilies are small and affected relatives are few, categorical\ndefinitions or simple counts are likely to be adequate.\nFAMILY HISTORY AS A PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL\nFamily history has been recognized in clinical medicine as an\nimportant, yet nonmodifiable, disease risk factor that when\npresent might influence the probability of a suspected diagno-\nsis. Collection and interpretation of family history has rarely\nbeen applied in the practice of preventive medicine to assess\ndisease risk and influence early detection and prevention strat-\negies. In this setting, pedigree analysis has primarily been lim-\nited to rare cases of cancer or cardiovascular disease where a\nstrong genetic component is obvious. Even when there is a\nstrong family history, many of these high-risk people who\ncould benefit from a genetic evaluation are missed by their\nprimary care physicians. 11 People at moderate-risk based on\nfamily history are even less likely to be identified. Henderson\nand Scheuner report on a study of managed care members\nwhere 53 charts from 15 primary care physicians selected ran-\ndomly were reviewed for family history. 12 This included data\nTable 1\nPrevalence and relative risk estimates due to family history for selected diseases\nDisease U.S. prevalence of the disease Risk due to family history\nCardiovascular disease 58 million OR /H110052.0 (one 1st-degree relative)38\nOR /H110055.4 (two or more 1st-degree relatives with onset /H1102155 yr)39\nBreast cancer 3 million women RR /H110052.1 (one 1st-degree relative)40\nRR /H110053.9 (three or more 1st-degree relatives)41\nColorectal cancer Yearly incidence /H11005130,000 OR /H110051.7 (one 1st-degree relative)26\nOR /H110054.9 (two 1st-degree relatives)27\nProstate cancer Yearly incidence /H11005200,000 RR /H110053.2 (one 1st-degree relative)42\nRR /H1100511.0 (three 1st-degree relatives)43\nMelanoma 200,000 OR /H110052.7 (one or more 1st-degree relative)44\nOR /H110054.3 (one 1st-degree relative)45\nType II diabetes 13 million RR /H110052.4 (mother)46\nRR /H110054.0 (maternal and paternal relatives)47\nOsteoporosis 8 million women OR /H110052.0 for osteoporotic fracture (female 1st-degree relative)48\n2 million men RR /H110052.4 for wrist fracture (father)49\nAsthma 17 million OR /H110053.0 (mother)50\nRR /H110057.0 (mother and father)51\nFamily history tool for public health\nJuly/August 2002 /H18528Vol. 4 /H18528No. 4 305\ncollected from 223 patient visits (4.2 visits per patient) that\noccurred over a 5-year period. Among the charts reviewed, 39\nbelonged to subjects who gave self-reports of a family history of\nat least one common disease; the physician recorded this fam-\nily history in only 36%. The number of first-degree relatives\nthat were reported by patients as having one of the conditions\nunder study was 115, compared with only 23 recorded by the\nphysician. The corresponding number of self-reported af-\nfected second-degree relatives was 213, and the physicians re-\ncorded only 4. The type of disease did not influence the family\nhistory recorded by the physician. Acheson et al.13 have found\nthat family practice physicians discuss family history about half\nof the time during new patient visits, and only 22% of the time\nduring established patient visits. This included discussion of\n“family issues” that might represent a broad range of topics in\naddition to medical issues. The quality of information col-\nlected was likely limited (although this was not determined)\nbecause the average duration of family history discussions was\n/H110212.5 minutes. Only 11% of patients’records included a family\ntree.\nIf it can be shown that family history can aid in risk stratifi-\ncation, improve early detection and disease prevention, and\ninfluence health promoting behaviors, then family history\ncould be used as a screening tool to find high- and moderate-\nrisk people who would benefit from more targeted interven-\ntions. Individuals and families could be encouraged to main-\ntain their own family health histories and share that\ninformation with their clinicians who should also be tracking\nand updating their patients’family health histories. Keeping a\nrecord of family medical history could be as routine as keeping\na child’s immunization schedule.\nSome have argued, however, that placing people in risk\ngroups may lead those in the “average population risk group”\nto become complacent about health promoting behaviors. 14\nThe population-wide approach seeks to convince all people to\nmodify their unhealthy exposures and increase health-pro-\nmoting behaviors.15 It is thought that some people will benefit\nmore than others, but the overall shift in the population will be\ntoward better health. However, most people also appreciate\nindividual differences in disease susceptibility. Prescribing a\ngeneric prevention program that does not recognize differ-\nences could lead to limited results, discouragement, and non-\ncompliance. Targeting higher risk people for prevention ef-\nforts that would be cost-prohibitive at the population level,\nsuch as referral for genetic consultation and testing, earlier or\nmore frequent screening, removal from environmental or oc-\ncupational risk factors, or the use of medications, could prove\nto be cost-effective.16\nWould individualizing risk empower people at above aver-\nage risk to seek medical advice and to practice healthy behav-\niors? Certainly, it could be argued that our current public\nhealth approaches to promoting healthy lifestyles that are tar-\ngeted to the population-at-large have not been entirely suc-\ncessful. Recent studies reveal that 61% of Americans are over-\nweight, 23% of people still smoke, and only 25% of adults\nengage in recommended physical activity levels. 17–19 And the\nprevalence of obesity and diabetes are increasing in the United\nStates.18 If people could be convinced on a more personal level\nof their need to improve their health based on a family history\nof chronic disease (and almost all of us have some family his-\ntory of disease), they may be more likely to engage in healthy\nbehaviors. From a public health perspective, there could be\nadditional benefits. Because many lifestyle choices and behav-\niors that reduce risk are similar across a wide variety of chronic\nconditions, there may be a spillover effect where risk is reduced\nsimultaneously for a number of conditions.\nVALIDATION OF FAMILY HISTORY FOR PREDICTING DISEASE\nTo be useful in public health settings, a family history tool\nmust be simple, easily applied, and inexpensive. Family history\nhas been shown to be a risk factor in many case-control studies\n(see Table 1), but a systematic evaluation of disease-specific\nfamily history information for disease risk stratification and\nprediction has not been done. A singular family history tool\ncould include a number of common chronic diseases and con-\nditions. Criteria for inclusion of diseases would include the\naccuracy with which the disease could be recalled, the preva-\nlence of the disease in the population, the risk associated with\nfamily history, and the availability of effective early detection\nand prevention measures.\nBefore family history can be embraced as a public health\nscreening strategy, a number of critical issues should be ad-\nTable 2\nSuggested guidelines for risk stratification based on family history\nHigh risk\n1. Premature disease in a 1st-degree relative\n2. Premature disease in a 2nd-degree relative (coronary artery disease\nonly)\n3. Two affected 1st-degree relatives\n4.

Adopted person with unknown family history\nFrom Scheuner et al.9\nYoon et al.\n306 Genetics IN Medicine\ndressed. The evaluation of a family history tool would not be\nthat different from the evaluation of predictive genetic tests. In\n2000, the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing\n(SACGT) recommended a process for assessing the benefits\nand risks for genetic tests. 20 The four components included\nanalytic validity, clinical validity, clinical utility, and ethical,\nlegal, and social issues that influence both validity and utility.\nThe SACGTs recommendations were intended primarily to\nenhance the way in which genetic tests are developed, re-\nviewed, and used in clinical practice. Likewise, the purpose for\na similar evaluation of a family history tool would be to deter-\nmine the accuracy and reliability of the tool for stratifying dis-\nease risk and the effectiveness of this risk stratification on early\ndetection and prevention efforts.\nANALYTIC VALIDITY\nAnalytic validity addresses how accurately and reliably the\ntool identifies disease among a person’s relatives. The specific\nelements of analytic validity include sensitivity and specificity.\nSensitivity is a measure of how well the family history tool\nidentifies relatives who truly have the disease of interest, and\nspecificity is a measure of how well the tool identifies the rela-\ntives who truly do not have the disease of interest. A few studies\nhave attempted to measure the sensitivity and specificity of\nfamily history instruments by interviewing relatives and con-\nducting medical record reviews. The validity of the instrument\nused to collect family history in the Utah study of CHD showed\n77% sensitivity and 85% specificity. 7 In a validation study of\nfamily history of diabetes, there was complete agreement be-\ntween information about diabetic status reported by patients\nin a clinic and the information given by respective relatives in a\nfollow-up interview.21 Disease that occurs at earlier ages and\nresults in more severe morbidity will likely be reported more\naccurately than disease that occurs late in life and is less severe.\nDiseases for which there may be some stigma, such as schizo-\nphrenia or alcoholism, may be reported less reliably. The set-\nting for the collection of family history information will also\naffect analytic validity. A take-home questionnaire that will\nallow individuals to confer with relatives or review family\nrecords will likely be more accurate than an interview that oc-\ncurs on the spot. The evaluation of the analytic validity of a\nfamily history instrument should involve comparisons with\nsome gold standard, such as can be done with medical records\nor direct interviews with living relatives. It should also include\nan assessment of the specific diseases included in the tool, the\nrelationship of the relatives included (first- and second-de-\ngree), and the settings in which the tool is administered.\nCLINICAL VALIDITY\nClinical validity addresses how well family history of disease\ncan be used to stratify disease risk and predict future disease in\na person. The specific elements of clinical validity include sen-\nsitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive value.\nLike predictive genetic testing, a family history tool is used to\nestimate the probability that a person will develop disease.\nWith highly penetrant gene mutations such as the one that\ncauses Huntington disease, a positive genetic test results in\nnear 100% certainty that a person will develop the disease. For\nmany other diseases where the causative genes are less pene-\ntrant, a positive test means that there is an increased probabil-\nity of disease but that development of disease may be influ-\nenced by other genes and environmental factors. Likewise with\na positive family history, a person may be at increased risk for\ndisease above that of the population at large, but the interac-\ntion of genetic and environmental factors will ultimately deter-\nmine whether or not the person develops disease.\nIn designing a family history tool that is useful in public\nhealth settings, there will be a trade-off between keeping it\nsimple and collecting enough information to make prediction\npossible. A simple tool may not be able to distinguish between\nhigh and moderate risk. Issues that will need to be considered\nand evaluated include the collection of information on more\nthan first-degree relatives, the list of diseases included in the\ntool, and the use of a classification system or algorithm for\ndefining level of risk. When a person is adopted or has few\nrelatives, the possibility of a family history rich in disease-spe-\ncific information is obviously much reduced. The collection of\nfamily history information will also have to be evaluated in the\ncontext of additional screening information. Family history\nmay have a synergistic effect in the presence of other known\nrisk factors. For example, in a study of pancreatic cancer, the\nrelative risk of pancreatic cancer associated with having a first-\ndegree family member with pancreatic cancer was 2.49 (95%\nCI, 1.32–4.69), which was similar to the relative risk associated\nwith ever smoking, 2.04 (95% CI, 1.09–3.83). The relative risk\nincreased to 8.23 (95% CI, 2.18 –31.07) for persons who ever\nsmoked and who had a family member with pancreatic cancer\ndiagnosed before age 60.22\nMeasuring the sensitivity and specificity of family history\ncan be done using data from case-control or large cohort stud-\nies. Sensitivity can be estimated by examining the family his-\ntory for a particular disease among a population-based group\nof people with that disease. Likewise, specificity can be esti-\nmated by examining family history for a particular disease\namong a population-based group of people without the dis-\nease. The positive predictive value can then be determined to\nprovide information on the probability that a person will de-\nvelop disease given a positive family history. Conversely, neg-\native predictive value is the probability that people will not\ndevelop disease if they have a negative family history. Unlike\nsensitivity and specificity, the positive and negative predictive\nvalues of a family history tool depend on the prevalence rate of\nthe disease in the population. If the prevalence of a disease is\nlow, even a highly valid tool will yield a low predictive value.\nEstablishing the clinical validity of family history tools will re-\nquire research involving the use of the tools in different popu-\nlation groups. It will also require careful consideration of po-\ntential reporting bias in case-control studies. Affected people\n(cases) may be more likely to report a positive family history\nthan are unaffected people (controls), resulting in an overesti-\nmate of predictive value. Reporting bias is also an issue that\nFamily history tool for public health\nJuly/August 2002 /H18528Vol. 4 /H18528No. 4 307\naffects the assessment of analytic validity. Although the impact\nof differential recall on the results of case-control studies has\nbeen examined in general,23 few studies have assessed potential\nbias associated with family history and estimates of risk for\nspecific disease.24\nThe contribution of family history to disease risk has tradi-\ntionally been assessed in terms of relative risk; however, the\nattributable risk may be a better indicator of the utility of fam-\nily history information. The population attributable risk is an\nestimate of the incidence of disease in a population that is\nassociated with exposure to the risk factor, in this case, family\nhistory.25 To be useful for individuals, risk estimates from ep-\nidemiological studies need to be described in terms of absolute\nrisk. People are more likely to understand their own probabil-\nity of developing disease given certain risk factors than they are\nthe relative or attributable risk of disease.\nThese concepts are illustrated in Table 3, where risk for colo-\nrectal cancer (CRC) is classified into three groups: 1) average\nrisk (no first-degree relative with CRC), 2) moderate risk (a\nfirst-degree relative with CRC after age 50), and 3) high risk\n(two first-degree relatives with CRC regardless of age). The risk\nestimates for the average and moderate risk categories were\nobtained from analysis by Fuchs et al. 26 of the Nurses’Health\nStudy and the Health Professionals Study. The risk estimates\nfor the high-risk group are presented as a range and were ob-\ntained from a population-based study in the United King-\ndom27 and a review of the genetics of familial adenomatous\npolyposis (FAP).28 Individuals presenting with a family history\nof CRC in the high-risk category may be at risk of disease of\nunknown origin or one of several high-risk syndromes, includ-\ning FAP and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\n(HNPCC).29 People carrying an APC gene mutation for FAP\nare virtually certain to develop CRC (absolute risk approach-\ning 1), usually by their mid-30s; yet FAP is rare (prevalence\napproximately 1/8000) and accounts for a very small share of\nCRC in the population (attributable fraction/H110211%). A moder-\nate family history of CRC, on the other hand, results in an\nabsolute lifetime risk of about 6% for the individual, and per-\nhaps 7% of CRC in the population. Unfortunately, the data for\nthese risk estimates that describe the impact of family history\non disease occurrence are not available for many of the diseases\nlisted in Table 1. There are case-control studies that have com-\npared the prevalence of family history between case and con-\ntrol groups, but population-based data are needed to calculate\nthe absolute and attributable risks. Models based on popula-\ntion data, including family history, have been developed for\nrisk prediction, such as the Gail and Claus models used to\nestimate lifetime risk for breast cancer.30,31\nCLINICAL UTILITY\nClinical utility is an assessment of the impact and usefulness\nof the family history tool for individuals, families, and society.\nPerhaps the most important issue is whether family history\ninformation can be used as a motivator to change behavior.\nGiven a tool that has reasonable analytic and clinical validity,\nwould the classification of individuals into risk groups im-\nprove the effectiveness of available early detection methods\nand interventions? Are public health interventions more effec-\ntive if they are targeted to high-risk groups? Are individuals\nmore motivated to improve their health if they know they may\nbe at higher risk than the average population? Would individ-\nuals in the average-risk groups become complacent and less\nlikely to engage in healthy behaviors? Studies of behavior\nchange have shown that just telling people that they are at risk\nof developing a disease is rarely sufficient to change behavior.32\nMarteau and Lerman propose that people ’s motivation to\nchange behavior may be increased if they believe that changing\nbehavior can reduce risks and that they have the ability to\nchange.14 A recent study of colorectal cancer found that a\nstrong family history of cancer was associated with better ad-\nherence to sigmoidoscopy recommendations. 33 And analysis\nof the Framingham Offspring Study found that mammogra-\nphy use was higher among women with a family history of\nbreast cancer compared with women without a family histo-\nry.34 More studies like these are needed to measure the extent\nto which knowledge of family history can influence beliefs and\nhealth promoting behaviors to prevent common chronic\ndiseases.\nTable 3\nRisk estimates for colorectal cancer for three risk groups as defined by family history\nRisk group Average Moderate High\nRisk factor No 1st-degree relative\nwith colorectal\ncancer26\nAny 1st-degree relative\nwith colorectal\ncancer after age 5026\nTwo 1st-degree relatives with\ncolorectal cancer27,28\nPrevalence of the\nrisk factor\n9/10 1/10 1/50 — 1/8,000\nAbsolute risk 0.04 0.06 0.20 a — /H110111\nRelative risk reference 1.7 4.9 — /H1101130\nAttributable\nfractionb\n— 0.07 0.07 — 0.004\naEstimated based on a relative risk of 4.9 and compared with people with no family history.\nbCalculated using Levin’s formula37 for population attributable risk.\nYoon et al.\n308 Genetics IN Medicine\nETHICAL, LEGAL, AND SOCIAL ISSUES\nIn addition to assessing the effect that knowledge of disease risk\nmay have on people, there are ethical considerations that must be\nevaluated as well. Labeling a person as high- or moderate-risk for\ndisease may have important psychological, social, and economic\ncosts. The use of a family history tool for public health purposes\ncould only be successful if people perceived greater benefit than\nrisk associated with revealing family medical information, if there\nwas no stigma associated with being at above average risk, and if\nthere were interventions and options for behavior change that\ncould make a difference in reducing morbidity and mortality.\nThese characteristics of family history of disease will need to be\nevaluated for each disease that may be included in a family history\ntool and for different population and cultural groups.\nCONCLUSION\nFrancis Collins has described a scenario in the year 2010\nwhere a primary care physician could offer a healthy 23-year-\nold male patient a DNA screening test that would provide es-\ntimated lifetime and relative risks for developing certain com-\nmon chronic diseases. 35 If it was discovered that the person\ncarried a genotype for a carcinogen metabolizing enzyme, for\nexample, that put him at increased risk for lung cancer, then\nthe patient could be encouraged to stop smoking or never start.\nAn analogous risk profile could be developed based on family\nhistory information. Unlike a DNA-based test that may not be\navailable until 2010 or later for establishing individual risk pro-\nfiles, family history tools are available now.\nTable 4 provides risk estimates for a hypothetical healthy\n23-year-old male, based on information collected using a fam-\nily history tool. The patient would be categorized as high risk\nfor colorectal cancer, moderate risk for cardiovascular disease\nand diabetes, and at average risk for melanoma. Additional risk\nfactor information, such as body mass index, smoking status,\nand ethnicity could be used to further refine the risk estimates\nand influence long-term management and prevention strate-\ngies. For the high colorectal cancer risk, referral of the family\nfor genetic evaluation and possible testing would be appropri-\nate. If a hereditary cancer syndrome could be defined, then\nmore frequent colonoscopy would be recommended for sus-\nceptible family members and prevention strategies for other\nsyndrome-associated cancers might be warranted (e.g., endo-\nmetrial, ovarian, and gastric cancer associated with hereditary\nnonpolyposis colon cancer). If a cancer susceptibility gene mu-\ntation were identified and excluded in a family member, he/she\ncould be reassured and average-risk screening guidelines could\nbe recommended. In the absence of diagnosing a hereditary\ncolon cancer syndrome, colonoscopy every 3 to 5 years begin-\nning 10 years earlier than the earliest age of colorectal cancer\nonset in the family could be offered to the patient. For the\nmoderate cardiovascular risk, the plan might include behavior\nchanges that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and dia-\nbetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight and exercising, and\nparticipating in standard lipids screening and treatment. Given\nthe average risk for melanoma, general recommendations for\nminimizing sun exposure and education regarding the charac-\nteristics of a skin malignancy would be appropriate.\nIn the scenario just described, family history information is\nused to customize disease prevention efforts and provide some\nadded value to current public health efforts aimed at the popula-\ntion-at-large. To determine the feasibility, validity, and utility of\nthis approach, we recommend the following actions. The first step\nwould be to convene a workshop of experts to further explore the\nideas we have outlined and develop a research agenda for design-\ning studies and analyzing existing data to assess family history. A\nmajor component of the research would be to evaluate simple\ntools for collecting family health history that can be used in public\nhealth settings. Development of the tools would include consid-\nerations of what conditions and diseases to include, what relatives\nshould be included, and how and where the tool would be admin-\nistered. A classification scheme could also be developed that\nwould group people into risk categories depending on the infor-\nmation collected. The data collection tools and classification\nscheme could then be evaluated for analytic validity and clinical\nvalidity under different settings. Once the validity of the tools has\nbeen established, hypotheses can be generated about the use of the\nfamily history information for improving health outcomes.\nFunding should then be made available for conducting public\nhealth research to test these hypotheses.\nAubrey Milunsky claims in his new book,Your Genetic Des-\ntiny,36 that “by knowing your genes, you can save your life. ”\nUntil we have genetic tests that identify susceptibility genes and\nbiomarker measures for most environmental exposures, fam-\nily history information that reflects our shared genetic\nmake-up and environment may be an effective means for pre-\nTable 4\nPreventive medical practice in 2002: Results of family history screening for a hypothetical, healthy 23-year-old male\nCondition Family history Risk group Relative risk Lifetime risk\nCardiovascular disease One 1st-degree male relative diagnosed after\nage 60\nModerate 2.0 60%\nColorectal cancer Two 1st-degree relatives, one with onset\nbefore age 50\nHigh 8.0 50%\nMelanoma None Average 1.0 /H110211%\nDiabetes type II One 1st-degree relative diagnosed after age 60 Moderate 5.0 30%\nAdapted from Collins.35\nFamily history tool for public health\nJuly/August 2002 /H18528Vol. 4 /H18528No. 4 309\ndicting our risk of future disease.

It remains to be seen\nwhether this knowledge would lead to increased adoption of\nhealth promoting behaviors. Perhaps by knowing your family\nhistory, you can improve your health and save your life.\nReferences\n1.
