INTRODUCTION\nAfter the cyber-crime occurs the criminal leaves a trace which indicates some critical information needed to prove \nthe characteristics of that criminal like the attack time, and the date and where it happened and the tool used, the investigators \nneed tools to match between the criminal and the cyber-crime using evidence. can be indicated by using special tools[ 1] \n(Forensic Tools) or cyber-forensic are tools using a branch of science, used in recovery and investigation of data and evidence by \ncollecting it from a different type of devices such as computers or mobile phones. \nAccording to  [2] one of the most important rules that must be taken into account when collecting digital evidence \nand information using digital forensic tools is that will no change is happened in evidence obtained, and evidence collectors \nwho use these tools should document all activities,  in addition to the undertook to keep the original documents and preventing \nthem from being modified or changed to preserve the evidence. \nIn this research, a group of electronic forensic tools related to computers, networks, and portable devices were dealt with, and \nit was found that most of these tools cover specific aspects and do not cover other aspects in the search for evidence, just as there \nis no complete crime, there are also incomplete tools. On the computer side, and based on the comparison, the following tools \n(FTK, Encase, COFEE, DFF) are considered complementary to each other. As for mobile phones, (Oxygen Forensic) is \nconsidered very suitable. As for networks, it is considered a tool (Nmap) that is closest to carrying out most of the tasks.On the \nother hand,I advise companies that work to produce these tools in cooperation with each other to benefit from practical and \nprogramming experiences to come up with a near-perfect tool that meets all the requirements of investigators in cyber-crimes \nor to collect these tools as a framework for investigation as special tools such as Sherlock Holmes tools for investigating actual \ncrimes. \nII. LITERATURE REVIEW\nThe new technology over the world in computer and cellphones using communications and transferring and storing data. this data \nbecame more precious than ever for every institute and individual and because of that, and cybercrimes increase over time and its \nmost sophisticated to identify the cybercriminal, new forensic tools need to keep abreast of developments features to the \nnew technology and cybercrimes.As mentioned [2] these days, with the increase in data storage and processing, there is a great \nrisk of losing it, and also data that is collected manually or through devices may be exposed to electronic attacks, with the \npresence of these dangers. There are many digital forensic tools through which evidence is collected and studied. It was \nconducted a study by [2] on these tools that governments, companies, and people use to extract digital evidence through \ncomparison based on different\nJournal of University of Shanghai for Science and Technology\nISSN: 1007-6735\nVolume 23, Issue 3, March - 2021\nPage-367\ndeterminants so that the appropriate tool is chosen based on needs and the study also includes the problems facing the users of \nthese tools. In this analysis or study for forensic tools, these tools are compared based on a list of parameters, based on study these \ntools does not cover all features that can be used for all situations in the case of study and cybercrime investigation to get all the \nevidence that can be found in the crime scene, the (EnCase) tool covers most benefits but not do live analysis and ( Pro-Discover \ntool ) although covers the live analysis but don’t work on multiple OS like the previous tool and do not have feature mail analysis. \nIn [3], a simulation was done by running an alternative Linux server to the Minecraft server and creating a collective hosting for \nthe players, and other players were connected via a computer with a Windows 7 system, and these hosting for both systems were \nin a (VM) environment on the same local network in addition to taking multiple screenshots with a VMware program, A \ncomparison of the screenshots was made when the activities in the case of using the server and the client, and other tools were \nused in these simulations to implement specific functions (VMware fusion to create Linux server and windows client imager to \ncreate a forensic image.VMDK, Autopsy to analyze windows files ad directors and system files, HXD to capture live memory \ndata, Volatility to carve artifacts from memory, Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic inside VMware , Network Miner \nto analyze network traffic was captured, windows event viewer to analyze all recorded event in the windows system) and this \nexperiment resulted in the following: \n1- The Minecraft server is managed by the perpetrator, where directories are located on the connected players ’ devices and\nthrough which the parent addresses and user names can be determined.\n2- The Minecraft server is the directory store, and violators can access the user name and contact information stored on the server.\n3- The Minecraft Windows client is used by the victim to carry out some crimes as the exchanged communication between others\nis information and other information can be known to other users such as the server operator and they can provide sufficient\ninformation about the offending connected user.\n4- Unique identification information is available for each user inside the Jason file and also in the Linux server's memory after the\ngame ends.\n5- In the event of impersonation of a player, it should be noted that the identification numbers expire one month before the date of\ncontacting the server.\n6- The artifacts were stored on the Linux Minecraft server and the program that was installed was run to see activities while\nplaying with the Windows client.\nAs for the timestamps in the local memory and the hard disk, a link was found between the user ’s unique identification numbers\nand the parent's addresses, and it remained stored for a month. As for the Windows client, it stored the e-mail linked to the\nregistered Minecraft.\nIn [4], a set of nodes were made using a Hadoop 2.7.4 running on the Ubuntu 16.04.3LTS environment, which is four nodes \n(Master NameNode,Two DataNodes, secondary NameNode). Screenshots were taken in each case of the device after the \nimplementation of one of the basic functions of the Hadoop system, the internal and basic distributed file system, and the \nprocedures that will be analyzed.The (HDFS) Hadoop Distributed File Systemenvironment has been forensically searched to \nobtain forensic artifacts that can be used in forensic investigations. This was done by applying a set of important HDFS \ncommands and monitoring the results to analyze the artefacts generated from each command, focusing on analyzing the Linux \nfilesystem and network files as well as the main memory during work periods. HDFS is a complex and large master structure \nmade up of configuration files, different systems and logs in the form of a network in which various information about the \nprocedures that take place within it can be obtained by analyzing it.The built-in commands within HDFS for the Editing Viewer \nand Offline Image Viewer have proven to be very important in recovering important forensic data during the investigation. These \ntools have resulted in investigators with important information from the FSimages and Edit log, and the output of these tools gives \na broad overview of special activities. By mass in implementing each of its actions.It turns out that the Hadoop log files contain a \nhuge amount of information related to the procedures that were carried out using Hadoop and the file record(hadoop-crime-\nnamenode-masternamenode.log)contains all the procedures for HDFS, and this file is very important for forensic investigators and \nthe output of this record is important when forensic analysis in the Hadoop environment.As for the analysis of processes in the \nmain memory of the HDFS evaluation, the result was that there was no important information related to the investigation from a \nforensic point of view because the HDFS processes operate as an abstract block.In addition to analyzing the communications that \ntake place between the nodes and analyzing the existence of criminal artifacts that are important and in determining the activity, \nsome information was obtained, but not sufficient, due to the presence of encryption between the nodes to increase security. \nA Ceph file system that provides high availability and self-repairing features for data, and provides a permanent access to data and \nsaves it from loss and damage[5].This system is considered better for cloud service providers and its importance and the activities \nof users on this system are considered as a priority .In the research paper ,  the remaining evidence was extracted from the users' \nuse for the system that was running in Linux Ubuntu 12.4 to discuss the extracted evidence, in addition to analyzing the forensic \nframework and cloud in the CephFS residue that was saved and analyzing it on the server and the client.The experiment contains a \nset of simulation devices that provide two OSDs, a monitor with an MDS node, responsible for the plaster for the node, and on e \nJournal of University of Shanghai for Science and Technology\nISSN: 1007-6735\nVolume 23, Issue 3, March - 2021\nPage-368\ncustomer device, individual nodes are created and tested based on Ceph values. The environment that was built for the forensic \nexperiment contains special configuration for the Ceph node (operating system- Linux Ubuntu 12.4, Ceph distribution-Giant ) and \nthe forensic tools used for this experiment  (HxD Hexeditor,CapLoader, Wireshark,Vmware Workstation, OSFMount ,Ext2 \nVolume Manager,OSForensics,Autopsy Meld ).The difficulty in collecting big data, which results from ten simple text files, is not \nsuitable for forensic investigators, and there is a need for an appropriate framework and automated tools to help in dealing with \nand processing data in an automated manner instead of a manual method, and the emergence of a problem in the manner of \ndifferent file systems such as XtremeFStone and Ceph system, where these systems provide different solutions to provide \nimproved and innovative products, including the forensic solutions of these cloud systems that fit one type and fail to deal with \nanother system. The tools that were used in this investigation gave results in determining the information related to the \ninvestigation, but automated systems must be developed to avoid manual searches. \nSeaFile service is considered an open-source cloud storage service, defects have been discovered on the server and the client that \ncan be restored legally, by specifying the client's synchronization, encryption, file and data management for authentication and \nforensic analysis, by creating eight virtual accounts for the role of clients and administrators and assigning an emoji and a unique \nname For each user account[6].The test consists of two VM workstations for servers, three virtual machines for clients, an iOS \ndevice and an Android device that have been restored to factory settings, and VMware was used to host the VMware Fusion \nProfessional version 7.0.0 on a MacBook Pro with a Mac OSX Mavericks 10.9.5 system with Intel i7 2.6GHz processor \nspecifications quickly. With a 16 GB main memory, virtual drives have been used because the use of physical devices to perfor m \nthe procedures is tiring in terms of copying, scanning and reinstallation, as the virtual machine offers an acceptable error rate \nthrough the use of restore points in the event of unacceptable results, in addition to using Physical mobile devices instead of the \nemulator for the ineffectiveness of the emulator because it deletes some of the features of these devices and provides \nunsatisfactory results, using devices with few spaces to save time and effort in analyzing snapshots, in addition to breaking the \nprotection of mobile devices to access the main system of portable devices (root).The test resulted in the fact that the private cloud \nis important to users and medium and small enterprises, but it is not without flaws in terms of forensicsSeaFile. As a result of the \ninvestigation, large data can be recovered from user devices, whether desktop or mobile, and data that passes through the network \nwhen using the SeaFile client application, such as logging out, logging in, installing and uninstalling these tools, chats, and files \nshared that have been synchronized and managed calculation.The scope of the investigation is known from the recovered artifacts \nand the scope of the search expanded, and the proposed framework provides forensic investigators with an effective process in \nprivate cloud services investigations. \nSpoke about the history of cybercrime and when these electronic forensic tools were created and classified digital forensic tools \ninto these categories (computer forensics, mobile forensics, database forensic, network forensics, and forensic data analysis) and \ndifferent types of framework[1]. Forensic work, in addition to[1] writing a brief text about each tool and making a comparison in \nterms of applicable tools and usage for each tool, for example, the tools used in email analysis,there are many tools to do this task \n(Mail, MBOX, OST) viewers. \nAs[7]proposed a framework and based on it, he created a table to identify any deficiencies in 25 forensic tools, and his conclusion \nis that there is no tool capable of covering the conditions of the proposed framework. In addition to proposing a tool to be \ndesigned based on the proposed framework and explaining all possible operations in this framework. It was adopted in building \nthe tool on the NetBeans IDE 7.1.1 tool and the Oracle 10g database and used the operating system for testing. Among the \nfeatures of the proposed tool: \n Protection of personal login information, whether for the user or even the administrator\n Reducing the rate of cybercrime by assisting law enforcement agencies in determining the percentage of crimes in each city\n Providing the ideal solution as it matches the proposed framework\n Increase the investigator's investigation experience through the feedback on the history of operations\n The production of automatic reports on the cases that have been investigated\nA comparison was made between two tools for analyzing data for Android devices, which are the commercial tool Paraben E3:DS\nand the open Autopsy tool[8]. In the experiment, all activities were restored on the Android phone using the first tool, but Autopsy\nwas unable to perform the necessary restoration, using the tool. In the first tool, the activities were restored with a time stamp,\nunlike the second tool, and the result is that using the appropriate tool, data can be recovered from Android phones and this data is\nof great value for forensic investigators to investigate the crime.\nIn the study conducted by [9], he surveyed the techniques used as forensic tools for phones based on the manual acquisition and\nphysical acquisition, logical data acquisition from Android-based devices and classified into a table containing the following\ncharacteristics (private or free, basic operating systems, number of supported devices) For example, the free volatility tool\nprovides support for multiple APIs to forensic workers to expand the work horizon, and the free forensic tool Oxygen contains\nmany of the techniques used for reporting and features from a graphical data interface, a graphical user interface, and support for\nmany devices.\nJournal of University of Shanghai for Science and Technology\nISSN: 1007-6735\nVolume 23, Issue 3, March - 2021\nPage-369\nCase study of [10] SCADA systems w as used, which is a set of tools used to extract forensic evidence and collect information \nabout the devices related to the case and networks, and the data collected was used to determine the penetration, the percentage of \nsystem penetration and examine the functional processes of the system that were affected, the experiment is a group of simple \nattacks Accurately described, and evidence is gathered after each attack by applying the methodology and tools for each attack \nmethod. The three attack experiments were conducted on the environment of the SCADA system and the attacks were Man in the \nMiddle, remote access, and a USB pin drive infected with a malicious program. As a result of the experience that was conducted, \neach attack needs different tools from the other, and the extracted digital evidence varies in different operating systems, and there \nis a difference due to the fact that SCADA devices differ from one provider to another and different generations. \nThe result of a test he did [11] on the forensic tools for phones Belkasoft Evidence trial and WhatsApp Key/DB extractor, it was \nfound that the two tools passed the repeat test, which results in the same number of artifacts, and they also passed the reproduction \ntest because they give the same image files in all the artifacts, also there is a difference in the result of the tool The first is t o \nrecover both pictures and videos with higher clarity beside files, while text messages are not recovered, while the second tool is \nable to recover photos and text messages only. The equipment and software used in the test is (Samsung galaxy s4 android v5.0.1, \nWhatsApp Ver2.17.147, workstation with windows 7 64bit, USB Cable, Belkasoft Evidence trial, WhatsApp Key/DB 4.7, SQLite \nstudio for analysis). \n“Digital Forensic Chain of custody (CoC) can be defined as a process used to maintain and document the chr onological history of \nhandling digital evidence” [12] Recording the minute details related to digital evidence across the different levels of the hierarchy, \nthat is, from the hierarchy rule to the highest authority responsible for cybercrime \nIt is also used as a reference for collecting, analyzing and preserving evidence, the people responsible for it, t he time and place of \ncollecting evidence, and in some cases the evidence may be subject to change during its course in the absence of proper \nmaintenance and preservation, which leads to its not being accepted by the Internet Crime Court [12]they categorize the attempts \nfor improving the CoC  \nto direct attempts including:  \n (DEMP) Digital Evidence Management Framework gives secure and reliable for CoC.\n (DEC) Digital Evidence Cabinets for enhancing handling digital evidence.\nIndirect attempts including\n (UMML) Unified Modelling methodology framework for planning, documenting and performing forensics tasks.\n \"Flow thing Model (FM) that involves six operations (create, release, transfer, arrive, accept, and process)\"[12].\nIII. METHODOLOGY\nThis paper explores the existing forensic tools available in Cybersecurity investigations, classify them according to their usage. \nThen full analysis has been performed highlighting the advantages and disadvantages. \nIV. DIGITAL FORENSIC MODEL\nDigital Forensics [13] “is a branch of forensic science focused on recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices” \n(computers, mobile phones, servers, network) related to cyber-crime. defined as the process of preservation, identification, \nextraction, and documentation of computer evidence that can be used by the court of law. \nWhen a cybercrime occurs and the perpetrator must be searched, those responsible for the investigation process follow the process \nas Figure1 shows. Carefully to ensure that the evidence is not tampered with and that a dead end is reached in the case, and so that \nthe officials ensure that the evidence is accepted in court when these proper procedures are taken. \nFig .1 Process of Digital Forensic \nA. Identification\nThe first responders to what (network administrator, law \nenforcement officer, investigating office) responsibilities are \nidentified and securing the crime scene and searching for digital \nevidence and determining where it is stored. Professional officials \nsearch for devices related to the execution of the crime and \nproperly seize them to extract evidence from them. \nPresentation\nDocumentation\nAnalysis\nPreservation\nIdentification\nJournal of University of Shanghai for Science and Technology\nISSN: 1007-6735\nVolume 23, Issue 3, March - 2021\nPage-370\nB. Preservation\nIn this step, the evidence is secured, isolated, and saved. By preventing others from tampering with this evidence, the forensic \nteam must secure digital evidence after ensuring a safe environment exists, in addition to ensuring the accuracy of the data and \nwhether it is original or not that has been collected and easy to access. \nC. Analysis\nDraw conclusions by reconstructing parts of data from the existing evidence. These data that were accessed by officials are \nscanned to determine the evidence that will be presented to the court. This phase includes identifying, examining, separating , \ntransforming and modeling data into valuable data. \nD. Documentation\nReconstructing the crime scene through records containing crime data. The detailed report contains all documents, reports and \ndocumented results, and this report contains sufficient evidence accepted by the legal court. \nE. Presentation\nSummarize and draw a conclusion,after completing the collection and analysis of evidence, [14] an offer report is built upon \nwhich the decision is made against the person who caused the event or crime, and the decision is saved in a database for future \nreference. The decision is a legal procedure in court cases and the main focus thereof. \nV. DIGITAL FORENSIC TOOLS\nBecause the crime occurred in virtual world now it called cyber-crime [2],because of that crime forensic tools founded to detect \nthe cyber-criminal by collecting evidence based on [15] digital forensic models that categorized to at scene includes (planning, \nidentification, collection, preservation) and in the lab includes (examination, analysis, report).Forensic Tools are categorized \nbased on the environment and devices (computer forensic, mobile forensic, network forensic) and these classifications have \nsubcategories as shown in Figure 2 \nFig .2 Digital Forensic Tool Classification \n1.
