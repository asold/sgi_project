Introduction  \nThe banking industry has been a pioneer in adopting \nelectronic markets. With outsourcing of back office \nprocesses in the growing interbank business, several forms \nof electronic markets between banks arose. Such electronic \nmarkets need to comprise a form of market infrastructure \nthat guarantees non-discriminatory access to all banks and \nthe ability of banks as well as others to offer services. The \ncurrent trends of instability in the international marketplaces, \nthe changing behavior of customers of banks, and the \n \n \ninnovations based on IT in combination with the entry of a \nvariety of new financial services offered by non-banks are \nstrong drivers towards electronic markets in the financial \nindustry. A description of the general characteristics of \nevolving customer-oriented infrastructure of organized \nelectronic markets is given. A large variety of banking IT \ninnovations that are currently on the market, or planned are \nillustrated. These innovations will result in more transactions \nbetween customers and banks being executed electronically. \nIt is assumed that market-driven electronic transactions will \nhave a negative impact on revenues of traditional banks. \nTraditional banks are expected to have much less power than \nsuggested by both Porter’s model of industry structure and \nthe tenets of the resource-based view of proper management. \nAfter a general description of the banking service focus, the \nimportance of competitive pressure from non-banks is \nillustrated. A description of the competitive arena is given \nfrom the vantage point of traditional banks which aim at \ngathering intelligence about induced events and \norganizational implications. The impact of further IT-\ninduced disruption is illustrated using an analysis of pre-\nforeign exchange deregulation in the European banking \nindustry. Risks for commercial banks potentially leading to \nloss of income, customers, and power in the industry are \nelaborated. Incumbent banks in traditional branches of \nbanking might be forced to transfer their basic Business to a \ngeneric form of a banking service marketplace provider \nthrough a level playing field and open architecture \ninfrastructure. \n1.1. Background and Significance                                              \nThe ongoing digital transformation of the financial sector \nhas rendered rethinking how banking services are structured, \nMigrating services to the cloud has empowered financial \ninstitutions to rapidly adopt developments such as AI and \nML. Banks are struggling to identify ways these new \ntechnologies can produce superior differentiation in an \naggressively competitive environment as managing them has \nmorphed into a matter of life or death. AI models can take \non agentic roles while infrastructure assets can exploit AI-\nenabled wizardry to self-optimize and self-heal. This \ninterplay between intelligent infrastructure and agentic AI \nwill be illustrated in the context of a trade and settlement \nplatform for digital assets and the associated settlement \ninstitutions being set up by a consortium of established \nbanks. \n \n     Fig 1: Future of Banking IT Services using Agentic AI \nModels. \nMajor banking institutions are acting as liquidity providers \nand venues for trading digital assets and their tokenized \ncounterparts. Trading activity is mediated by a set of systems \nand services provided by a collection of vendors, giving rise \nto complex technology ecosystems consisting of \ninterconnected and interdependent IT infrastructure, \nservices, data and technologies. This demands sophisticated \narchitectural and operational capabilities for managing \nservice interdependencies, data sharing and movement, and \nintegrity assurance among constituents. The latter is \nespecially pertinent to entities engaged in the financial \nservices domain, given the velocity and volume of trades \ninvolved, and the size of financial losses incurred by \ninadvertent lapses in data integrity. \n2. Overview of Banking IT Services \n\n \n \nThe banking industry is one of the earliest adopters of \ninformation technology (IT) to support the operational \nprocesses of banks themselves. For example, since the mid-\n90s, electronic market locations with central settlement, like \nexchanges or clearinghouses with netting, have been adopted \nby the banking industry to support the interbank currency or \ncredit markets. Almost all banks engage these services for \nthis purpose, while aiming for bilateral relations in \ncustomer-facing currency or credit markets — a design that \nis both inefficient and provokes systemic risk. The financial \ncrises, changing customer behavior, innovations based on IT, \nand finally, competition from non-banks drive a compelling \nneed for more customer-orientation in the financial industry. \nIn particular IT-competences like those of the banking \nindustry are essential to endorse basic IT services for more \ncustomer-orientation. \nThe central idea of the paper is a solution that could prompt \nsome banks to pivot into strategic partners concerning IT \nservices, rather than clients. In fact, a large variety of \nbanking IT innovations has emerged, which future of banks \nmay be illustrated. Currently, this paper conceives the \ncontention that traditional banks will have to change their \npositions in the financial markets. The limiting conditions \nfor the banking gondola’s ascent will be provided in a next \nsection: a competitive analysis will illustrate the resulting \nimpact on the banking industry, and as well as the parallels \nto the media industry, where entrants from the computing \nindustry have enabled disruptive changes. The major forces \ndriving the banking gondola’s potential ascent will be \nelaborated in the following sections. The final sections \nconclude this position paper by discussing potential \nindicators for the gondola’s ascent in the future. \n2.1. Research Design                                                                   \nAims of this Research \nThe study relies on the exploratory research method, which \nexplains the provision of a comprehensive conceptual \nframework explaining the future architecture of the ICT \necosystem of bank IT services. The research advocacy aims \nto chart the future of banking IT services as a convergence \nof both intelligent infrastructure and agentic AI \narchitectures, where each is capable of considering this \nasymmetric duality without being submerged by the \ncomplexity of its counterpart. The capability of the banking \nIT service ecosystem to perform as a converged architecture \nwill incrementally increase to the point that it will become a \nnew norm of banking IT. \nTo support its position, the research argues that in less than 5 \nyears' time, the future of banking IT will no longer be \nmonolithic or static. This shift will follow the trajectory that \nbanking IT service provisioning will diverge and be \ncomposed of specialist service providers. Until there is a \nconvergence point of the intelligent infrastructure and \nagentic AI architectures for banking IT service provisioning, \nthe banking IT service ecosystem will be bipartite: One side \nwith user banks adopting as a choice on their infrastructure \nintelligent approaches in both equipment and system aspects, \nwhile the other with fintech players adopting agentic AI \nparadigms to develop apps residing on these architectures \nand outcast banks from their own domain. Thus, within this \nbifurcated ecosystem of future banking IT services, each \nside may perform at best independently their otherworldly \nperformance metric with damaging consequences on the \npayment user banks and their industry at large. \nThe research aims to assess the state-of-the-art in AI \ninnovations and the pursuit of such approaches in banking IT \nservices, exploring the unexplored leverage of the financial \nservices delivery paradigm shift of the banking IT service \necosystem through converging intelligent infrastructure and \nagentic AI architectures. Major banking institutions, retail \nbanks, and firms operating in the payments market are \nselected for survey analysis. Interviews with top executives \nare conducted in professional settings regarding changes in \nhow they provide banking IT services and AI innovations. \nThese systemic changes are examined and understood as a \nprogressive paradigm shift from a uniform provisioning of \nlarge-scale and vertically integrated banking IT services \nfrom user banks to fintech players as a monopolistic and \nprivatised system. \n \n \nEqu 1: Autonomous Decision Score (ADS). \n3. Intelligent Infrastructure in Banking \nAspects of the Intelligent Infrastructure \nWhen analyzing how technology paradigms can benefit \nbanks to survive and thrive in a future digitalized and \ncustomer-focused world, special attention is given to the \naspects which are assumed to figure in the intelligent market \ninfrastructure as developed and described above. The initial \nemphasis is on the systematic toolkit technology enabling \nbanking IT innovations. An overview on the basic \ncomponents raging from agent technology, based on a \nformal specification of agent behavior and knowledge, and \nknowledge management infrastructure enabling the supply \nof appropriately personal knowledge, to market technology \nto make computerized intelligent agents competitive and to \nhold agent integrity is given. Next, the basic infrastructure \nenabling technologies for banking are sketched ranging from \nan intelligent infrastructure similar to or in close analogy to \nthe model of the international telephone network, all leading \nto true banking technology being difficult for banks to \nimitate, to the intelligent bankers - agents as representatives \nof customers/banks. Each of the kinds of technology \ninvolved is illustrated by an evolving or already established \nintelligent agent-based banking IT innovation of banks. \nThe term Intelligent Infrastructure is defined based on \npolitical market and banking ideals describing the \ninfrastructure desirable to facilitate and insure a customer-\noriented banking industry. It is shown how these banking \nideals relate to recent Internet and e-business technology as \nenabling paradigms to realize the banking ideals without a \nhuge investment in new and hitherto unfamiliar technology, \nespecially also for small banks lacking the resources for \ndeveloping extensive banking IT innovations. It is asserted \nthat the technology for realizing the intelligent infrastructure \nis evolving, that the most important prototypes are currently \nbeing developed by banks in cooperation with IT companies, \nthat agents are a needed part of the intelligent infrastructure, \nand that banks’ market-makers are the crucial intelligent part \nof the banking IT field unseen by customers. \n \n              Fig 2: Intelligent Infrastructure in Banking. \n3.1. Definition and Components                                                  \nA Maturity Model for Banks to Plan and Deploy Intelligent, \nForecasting Infrastructure in Gradual Stages, Turkey is the \nsecond largest market across the Europe, Middle East, and \nAfrica. The maturity model aims to help financial \ninstitutions to establish an intelligent infrastructure and \ncreate added value by forecasting scenarios to improve the \ndecision-making of businesses. Five maturity levels \n\n \n \nincluding the technology landscape and corresponding \nsolutions. The convergence of an intelligent infrastructure to \nenhance customer experience and operational excellence and \nhow to understand cultural, technical, and financial readiness \nof financial institutions in order to determine a deployment \nroadmap, thereby defining user acceptance issues in terms of \nanticipation, transparency, and auditability of AI models. It \nexamines how AI initiatives in banking can be classified, \nevaluates trends and challenges in emerging societies, and \nproposes guidelines for mitigating risks. This research \ncontributes to uncovering the convergence of two seemingly \nindependent streams of AI research and proposes a maturity \nmodel to help finance professionals in understanding what \nthis convergence means for their organization and how to \ndeploy agentic models in gradual stages. The convergence of \ninfrastructure-centered AI and agentic AI can be seen as the \nsecond wave of AI transition in banking. Drawing on betting \nand recommender systems literature, it conceptualizes basic \narchitectural elements of infrastructure- and agentic-centered \nAI applications along with user groups targeted by either \napplication type. Operating on different levels of abstraction, \nit examines the pressures justifying this convergence from \ndifferent perspectives and highlights potential risks and \nmitigation measures. Hence, it provides foresight, a \ncomprehensive framework, and an analytical lens for \nresearchers and banking professionals alike. Particularly, \nview infrastructure-centered and agentic AI as independent \nstreams often occurring in separate organizational subunits \nand further argue that this separation leads to validity issues \nfor both types of application. It presents the convergence of \nthese applications as the second wave of AI transition in \nbanking organizations offering the ability for some AI \napplications to become more intelligent, provide \ninterpretability, and operate across firm borders. \nSubsequently describes the basic components of this \nconvergence, including aspects related to machine learning \nmodels and supporting IT infrastructure. Finally, examine \npossible divergence problems leading to dubious decisions. \nIt complements current AI in banking literature, where a \nunifying theoretical framework is still lacking on concepts, \nfunctionality, and application types. \n3.2. Benefits of Intelligent Infrastructure: Intelligent \ninfrastructure combines machine automation, software-\ndefined operations, and ubiquitous programmability to create \ndynamic, optimized, and intelligent IT infrastructure. \nIntelligent infrastructure can yield significant productivity \ngains, cost savings, improved performance, operational \ninnovation, and enhanced customer experiences. Insiders, \nbusiness units, and customers can rapidly test, roll out, and \nmanage capabilities where and when there is demand. Note-\ntaking systems, web application deployments, website \noptimizations, and business intelligence models are some \ncommon intelligent infrastructure use cases. The investment \nbank's productivity tools: equity research by compiling \nanalyst thoughts/perceptions, displaying key \nnews/commentaries, distributing call calendars, summarizing \nrevenues & estimates/peer stocks & ratings with timely key \nnews or events. This enables the investment bank to close \nthe loop for the productivity tool where all references are \nfully supported with unique identifiable sources. Intelligent \ninfrastructure is a key enabler for agents and scalable, \nprocess-agnostic AI models. \nBusiness and IT users alike define the rules and where cloud \nservices are deployed to execute personal & organization \nproductivity applications with desired operating resources. \nEssentially, the bank believes in 15 minutes of automation \ndelivery, and an army of business users developed/own \nautomated processes (52% processes owned by businesses) \nthrough reverse engineering. Such programs were sought to \nbe translated into models by skipping technical \nimplementation. A scale-agnostic intelligent infrastructure \nconnects data centres and clouds, enabling a global market \nfor workloads to pursue lower operating costs and deliver \ncustomized solutions. As new classes of quick-deploy, \nusage-based capabilities redefine the application perimeter, \nthe hyper-scaler's general/programmatic middle office \nenables diverse organizational productivity tools. An \nintelligent infrastructure's programmable protocols, \nmonitoring, and management allow responsive provisioning \nand automated tuning, repair, and redundancy to absorb \ndemand spikes. \n \n \nFurthered with data models, a programmable intelligent \ninfrastructure learns, devises, and executes optimization and \nautomation aware of workloads, networks, and resources. It \nuses data science to adapt or upgrade intelligent \ninfrastructure continually. Private cloud services could \ninclude platforms for rapid ingestion, modelling, \nexperimentation, and deployment of wide use tasks where \nexternally trained/compiled AI models could obtain and \ndeliver indisputable productivity. For FT-based productivity \ntools: newly produced AI models would substantially \nimprove intelligence infrastructure compliance and \ndeployment support. \n3.3. Challenges in Implementation                                       \nWhile there are great opportunities in integrating intelligent \ninfrastructure with agentic AI models, stakeholders may also \nface a myriad of challenges. It is worth noting that agentic \nAI refers to autonomous systems that exhibit cognitive, \nrational, or behavioral capacities similar to those of \nintelligent agents, a subset of AI that can think, learn, and act \nindependently in the world. Financial institutions must \nappreciate that designing infrastructures capable of hosting \nagentic AI is not trivial; it requires the analytics and \ncomputational sciences to be integrated to enhance \nenterprise-level predictivity of neoteric concerns. \nStakeholders need to be aware of methodologies and \ntechnologies that would be required for hybridization of core \nservices through which traditional banking-oriented \nofferings can be transformed into customer-focused \nexperiences to raise expectations and astuteness. Moreover, \nan evolved ecosystem comprising green, ethical, societal, \nand regulatory concerns both internally and externally must \nbe created. In doing so, stakeholders must manage \ncomplementary and competitive changes in environmental \nlaws and regulations across jurisdictions and buck the trend \ninstead of succumbing to carnivorous competition. \nMoreover, there are challenges in attracting the right talent \nand managing its deployment. While agentic AI can preserve \nknowledge and assist expert retraining, it cannot entirely \nreplace human hybrid thinking in making rational judgments \non difficult problems. If people perceive stakeholders’ \nanalogue participation as lack of incumbent intelligence, \nthey would abandon them for more participative ones. \nOverreliance on agentic AI also reduces context-dependent \nreasoning. Lastly, DAB entails dual-edge ramifications. \nSeveral top-tier banking institutions have recently been \npenalized due to breaches committed by chain participants \nand hostile hacking of applications. They must therefore \nimplement cyber risk management frameworks within each \nchain participant to address security concerns proactively. \n4. Agentic AI Models \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an advanced software \nalgorithm that replicates human cognition for problem-\nsolving, decision-making, and planning. In lay terms, AI is \nthe ability of a machine to imitate human intelligence. AI \nsystems can be a physical hardware system programmed to \nanalyze information, conduct exact duties, and communicate \ninformation to humans. AI is also a computer program \nwithout direct physical hardware that takes input in the form \nof data, analyzes it, and creates output in the form of reports \nor suggestions for users. Robotics is the branch of AI that \ndeals with hardware systems that perceive, act, and think. A \nmore recent definition of AI states that AI refers to adaptive \nprograms capable of independently coordinating their \nfunctions, learning through experience, and making data-\ndriven decisions without the need for updates or human \nintervention. \nAI systems comprise three components: algorithm, data, and \nhardware. These components perform multi-step processing \nand generate wisdom, which is knowledge specifically \ntailored for an application domain and formatted for user \nunderstanding. Machine learning (ML) is a class of AI \nalgorithms that learn via experience. There are other types of \nAI algorithms besides ML, such as expert systems, natural \nlanguage processing (NLP), and computer vision. However, \nself-learning algorithms outperform all other types of AI in \nmost applications, leading to the current externalisation of \nAI as ML. \n \n \nAgentic AI models, a narrow set of advanced language \nmodels, are designed to generate creative output and respond \nto users' questions. Agentic AI leverages embedded \ncapabilities within advanced large language models (LLMs), \ntransforming them into autonomous agents. Agentic AI \ncould create a new genre of applications that leverage \nbusiness, public policy, academic, and entertainment use \ncases. \nIndustry research firms estimate that by 2030, agentic AI \nwill have an economic impact of US$8–12 trillion annually. \nHowever, a reconsideration of this technology's paradigm is \nessential. Agentic AI systems may undermine information \nintegrity, manipulate and harm individuals, and falsistically \nstock ethnic and regional biases. The Banking Sector needs \nto address these issues and create a regulatory framework \ngoverning this converging technology to decipher truth from \nmisinformation. The convergence of these three technologies \nmay contribute to the mismanagement of customer \ninformation, accelerating firm technological obsolescence \nand peer-competitive disaggregation. \n \n                                   Fig 3: Agentic AI  \n4.1. Understanding Agentic AI                                              \nAgentic AI refers to a fundamentally transformative range of \nstate-of-the-art machine learning models and services that \nhave autonomy, creativity, and agency in the way they \ningest, access, learn from, and generate data. These models \ncan also immediately integrate with the ever-emerging \nintelligent infrastructure services and solutions, providing \nbanks with instant returns on investments. Intelligent \ninfrastructure is a range of infrastructure and operational \nservices, supported by generative AI and cloud-based \narchitectures, that can auto-configure, deploy, and upgrade \ntheir services. These services allow banks to leverage large-\nscale model suites like Large Language Models (LLMs), \nVision Language Models (VLMs), and Prompting Models \n(PMs) through a neural-centric model factory paradigm. \nThese prebuilt and composable plumbing agents, archetypes, \nsea-creatures, and full-service models allow banks to rapidly \ncreate, deploy, maintain, and integrate card infrastructure \nintelligence throughout their banking stack. Importantly, this \nmeans banks can rapidly meet their most pressing consulta-\ntion needs, which tend to be dramatically unaddressed or \npoorly addressed by conventional IT services. \nAgentic AI contains generative AI, which currently is the \nmost conspicuous area of novel, impactful, and disruptive AI \ntechnologies. However, generative AI is unlikely to have its \nimpact fully realized for some time. On the other hand, \nintelligent infrastructure is a more dynamic and diverse \nrange of generative and initial AI technologies that can \ndetermine how rapidly generative AI will enter mainstream \nproduction use in banking. This infrastructure can \nimmediately integrate with and capitalize on emerging \nintelligent infrastructure services, enabling deployment of \nhundreds of AI models with low code and no code solutions \nthat enable extensive and continuing access to the myriad \nclasses of model services. As a result, generative AI can \naddress the extensive and continuing needs that will arise for \nany intelligent infrastructure and services that depict, \ngenerate, and transform language or vision. Agentic AI \n\n \n \nencompasses a much wider set of services and models that \nwill have a pervasive impact on all aspects of banking. \n4.2. Applications in Banking                                                  \nRecent advances in AI-powered chatbots illustrate the \ncommencement of significant operational changes within \nbanking institutions. Yet there are concerns about privacy, \naccountability, acceptability, and auditability of these \ntechnologies. The deployment of advanced analytical tools \nwithin the banking industry can shift the balance between \nconsumers and banks, giving banks access to more raw data, \npotential to exploit it, and ability to use the data in ways not \npreviously conceivable. The supervision of the financial \nsector is increasingly challenged by new players—and \ntechnologies—and banks need to adapt their business \nmodels and move beyond regulation to regain public trust. \nWith smart robotics already executed at accountancy firms, \nAI-based pricing systems installed at some banks, and \nexperimentations with ultra-targeted marketing in the retail \nsector, AI is a technology that banks will likely sooner adopt \nthan not. \nSpeech and voice recognition, text mining, visual inspection \nand production line monitoring, among others, are well \nestablished tools of AI. All these tools can determine the \ncomplex bank-state buffers that financial transaction \nmodelling does not grasp. Instead, a model banking algebra, \nshaped by Thoreau’s 19C nature philosophy and applied \nmathematical design algebra, will yield insight into the \ngolden ratio of banks. Intellect and insight are crucial to \nhandle the synthesis of very complex mathematical \nstructures. Currently-booming finance innovation may be the \nactual game changer for testing these thoughts. Start-ups \nwant to make service delivery standards in banking spheres \ntransparent. This should allow one to transcend the finance \npyramids of individual banks, which possess the knowledge \nnetworks across state boundaries and order of magnitudes of \ncomputation capabilities for key trade modelling and risk \nassessment. \n4.3. Ethical Considerations                                                          \nAs outlined in the introduction, the innovation in banking IT \nservices is envisioned as Hybrid IT services consisting of an \nIntelligent Infrastructure layer made of highly interoperable \nCloud infrastructures, hosting Cloud services potentially \ndeveloped by multiple providers, and a core layer made of a \nconverged Agentic AI architecture equipped with an \nAdaptive Analytics engine implementing self-learning \napproaches, coupling ML and textual analysis. A key \noutcome of the work will be a better understanding of the \nethical considerations arising from these innovations and of \nthe safeguards to enable their benign development and use. \nThe ethical and legal implications will be analyzed first with \nrespect to two cornerstones of Core IT services: 1) the use of \nCloud infrastructures, and 2) the use of Agentic AI \narchitectures and self-learning mechanisms. \nThe general ethical framework for the responsible design \nand usage of information and communication technology \n(ICT) stressed several generic considerations which should \nform part of the design of all ICT: “ensure accountability by \ndesign; promote the well-being of humanity as a whole; \nembed constraints to shape the use and impact of \ntechnologies; prioritize fairness and non-discrimination; \n[and] address the emerging magnitude of contemporary \ntechnology advances.” These considerations are pertinent \nalso to the ethical issues arising in the use of the two \ncornerstones of a Hybrid IT: 1) if the Cloud infrastructures \nmay be (mis)used for malintent, and if so, whether and how \nto curtail such toxic uses, and 2) if Agentic AI systems are, \nat least partly, expected to emulate independently the \nfunctionality of their human designers, and if this would \nentail whether a degree of oversight/validation would be \nneeded, and by whom, etc.. With finer granularity, ethical \nconsiderations regarding Cloud infrastructures, and AI as \nwell as Agentic architectures will now be discussed, \nrespectively. \n5. Convergence of Intelligent \nInfrastructure and AI \n \n \nAI in business applications can be grouped into three \ncategories: Predictive AI, Prescriptive AI, and Agentic AI. \nPredictive AI models uncover hidden patterns in data to \nautonomously generate forecasts about future events. \nPrescriptive AI models analyse historical data to simulate \ncustom scenarios, offering quantifiable recommendations for \nstrategic responses to predicted events. Agentic AI models \ntake a step further, combining the capabilities of predictive \nand prescriptive models to autonomously perform AI-\ngenerated recommendations for customers, including \nmonetary transactions in external environments. Intelligent \ninfrastructure encompasses the interconnected, autonomous, \nand intelligent architectures of hardware, software, \nnetworks, and data that build machines, robots, and devices \ncapable of executing agentic AI models. This convergence \nof agentic AI technologies and intelligent infrastructures \nheralds a radical reimagining of the banking sector. Banking \nIT service providers will need to proactively construct a self-\nevolving intelligent cloud infrastructure that enables the \ndevelopment, deployment, and operation of their own \nindependent banking agentic AI models. Unregulatable \nSecurity is a frontier research challenge aiming to generate \ntrustworthy autonomous AI agents. Traditional AI \ncybersecurity technologies aim to protect a system against \nadversarial attacks, but those rely on security assumptions \nthat the AI or cyber-physical agents modelled by perception-\naction loops on a fully observable environment. Such \nassumptions eliminate the “unregulatable” notion where \nintelligent infrastructures perceive only partial observations \ndue to inaccessibility to some model parameters, \nenvironment states, or AI agent codes. \n5.1. Synergistic Benefits                                                        \nSynergistic Benefits of Intelligent Infrastructure and Agentic \nAI Models \nBanks have the main goal to satisfy their clients with chosen \nfinancial products. They are user-oriented and wish to get to \nknow clients and their account behavior as precisely as \npossible and to take care of clients so that they expect good \nservices and assistance in special situations. A better \nunderstanding of clients and more attentiveness suggests \nbundling client information with additional principles from \nbanks’ current transactional databases. These unstructured \ndata can help to cover other aspects of clients. That is why \nintelligent infrastructures must span interaction levels and \non-device/in-cloud processes; agent-based AI models make \nclient models observable, and adaptable and thus encourage \nintelligent infrastructures’ adoption. \nWhereas each infrastructure layer predicts usual account \nactivities, agentic AI models give systems specific \nexpectations of the banking agent’s behavior. So far, \ncommunications with clients and speculation on their \nbehavior are only one-sided. Future solutions must rather \nembody operational-level capabilities and goal deliberation \nto make intention together and alternative solution proposals \nunderstandable. However, combining these two families is \nvery challenging. Deeply trained models offer fascinating \nflexibility but bring risky operational budgets to high-stakes \ndecisions. This article’s scenarios do not include right to be \nforgotten mechanisms for client behavioral models, which is \nsensitive to study theoretically. Integrating IA and awareness \nmechanisms is not straightforward; agent behaviors must be \npre-computed to recognize awareness and switch roles \nwithout model displacement. \nAnother important future direction of research is the \napplication of specially tailored, reliable, robust, and \nexplainable AI for lower risks and complexity. Good agents \nare curious, socially-aware, appropriate, and cooperative. \nCareful deliberation is necessary to apply multi camera \nsetups or multimodal agentic AI systems for highly safety-\ncritical tasks, which are the domains of banks outside one-to-\nplan scenarios. Highly sensitive client interaction must be \nsafeguarded against diffusion and formation toward smart \nmobs. Hereby agentic AI technologies must act as human \npartners to guide and assist bank staff, agents, and clients \nthrough complex planning or argumentation processes while \npreserving decision support. \n \n \n5.2. Case Studies of Successful Integration                         \nThe vast transformation of the business landscape has left no \nindustry untouched, and the financial services industry is no \nexception to this trend. The digitisation of customer \ninteractions is further transforming banks. Interactive voice \nresponse systems gave banks the ability to handle millions of \ncalls more easily through an automated process, but \nconsumers quickly grew tired of this type of customer \nsupport. Virtual assistants with better natural language \nunderstanding moved to fill the gap in banks’ customer \nservice lines. These assistants have made significant \nadvancements in voice banking and have captured the \ngenerators’ excitement while also raising questions about \naccuracy, fairness, and the ethics of AI. Companies are \ndeveloping robots with extensive investing and training, as \nwell as human-like faces, to make the human-AI relationship \nas user-friendly as it can be. \nThe strategy of the State Bank of India was examined \nthrough a case study of the SBI-SIA Virtual Assistant, which \nis based on big technology and digitalization. One of the \nsafest, most trustworthy, and client-oriented banks in the \nworld is SBI. The country’s top bank, SBI, offers reliable \nassistance. The State Bank of India launched an AI prompt \nfrom SBI’s side, which greatly enhances the customer \nexperience. AI is an environment-friendly, client-centered \nbanking tool designed with the biggest number of customers \nin mind. The chatbot, “SBI-SIA,” is designed to meet the \nrising expectations of mobile-savvy, tech-savvy clients who \nlead busy lifestyles. The group is attempting to improve \nvirtual performance while maintaining a balance with soft \ntissues. This paper presents a brief overview of SBI's \nstrategy of intelligent banking, major technological \nadvancements, and the chatbox role in SBI's customer \nexperience. Further, challenges and solutions are also \ndiscussed. \nIn addition to providing more convenient banking, improved \ncustomer service, and protection against fraud, AI in banking \nwill transform the functionality and service delivery methods \nused to carry out daily banking tasks. Banks that recognize \nthe need for change, that are willing to do more than simply \ncomply with legislation, and that look for current, “outside-\nthe-box” options are more likely to be effective. Adopting a \ncautious increase in AI capability in conjunction with current \nsystem improvements is suggested for further long-term \nsuccess. In most engagements using AI in banking, an \nupfront understanding of the client's situation and needs, as \nwell as the use of best practices in user analytics, design, and \ngovernance that generate algorithms aligned with objectives, \nresult in better initial outcomes. \nEqu 2: Self-Optimization Feedback Loop. \n        \n6. Impact on Banking Operations \nThis section takes a look at the long-term, transformative \nimpacts on banking operations. Banking is one of the most \ndata-intensive industries worldwide. In particular, even small \nto mid-sized banks have vast databases of customer \ntransactions, demographics, and other behavioral attributes. \nBased on great advances in big data processing and cloud \ncomputing, banks are reimagining their operations as AI-\nfirst. With a wide array of second-wave AI models, banks \ncan track evolving customer needs, recommend tailored \nproducts or engagement channels, and plan branch \ndeployment. Credit cards and personal loans, which \ntraditionally relied on rigid scoring models based on fixed, \ncontinuous data input attributes, are now augmented with \nagentic AI models that analyze thousands of behavioral \nattributes and spontaneously learn. \n\n \n \nTelecoms and social networks are the most advanced \nexamples globally. However, banks generate a stream of \ndetailed transactions not directly available to these tech \ncompanies. In countries like China and Brazil, small banks \nare already well positioned to monetize this data. Critically, \nfintechs are becoming agents that acquire data outside of \nbanks. A few other fintechs allow banks to analyze payee \nlists and evaluate creditworthiness. These factors position \nbanks, particularly those with deposits but mineable \ntransaction flows, as long-term AI winners in banks and in \ntech ecosystems. Early movers can reconfigure operations at \nthe intersection of liquidity scarcity and vast data generation, \nresulting in rapid turnover growth rates but lower go-forward \nvaluations. \nLikely, incumbent banks price in both substantial customer \nattrition and subsequent data-poverty. Banks aggressively \nreverse equations, like load balance and the yield, by \nacquiring off-book payments and deposits to raise turnover \ncounter-cyclically. Banks can also use aggressive \ntransaction-specific fees, resulting in lower turnover growth \nbut greater initial margins and valuations. This strategic \npivot requires re-integration of the organic, massive data \nwith both telecommunication and non-telecommunication \ndatasets. Banks need an extensive ecosystem strategy to \nsecure an operation in the AI-first business landscape while \nmaintaining optionality to capture upside in both business \nmodels. As transition risks are generating substantial book \nlosses on cash-burn valuations, banks should price in both \nlow upfront fees and significant equity dilution under ideal \nexecution strategies. \n6.1. Operational Efficiency                                                          \nThe banking industry has started to embrace the possibilities \nof digital transformation. Efforts are being intensified to \nimprove client-facing issues, and the quest for operational \nefficiency is high on the agenda of financial institutions. \nBesides their public interest obligations, banking, a service \nindustry, is in need of trust and confidence. There is a \ngrowing concern that traditional banks are losing touch with \ntheir core business purpose due to their preoccupation with \nregulatory compliance. This may undermine a long-term \ncompetitive edge against diverse new entrants from the IT \nindustry. Customers have gone online or mobile and use \npayment services without having traditional banks as direct \nintermediaries. Financial markets without banks are \nplausible, and swaps, a core offer of investment banking, are \ncapturing the interest of exchanges. If the banking business \nbecomes transaction-driven owing to transparent new \nelectronic markets, or commodities without intermediaries, \nthe conversion of institutions as “money banks” will be fast. \nNot only regulators but also banks should realize the \nimportance of addressing the trend. \nIn a multi-stakeholder open environment, transaction \ntransparency is not only a disadvantage but also an \nadvantage in ensuring client interest. The recently started \nbarter trading with the easiest object is an example of non-\ninfrastructure banks using the newest technologies without \nintermediaries. In the direct view of customers, banking is \nnot just a means of service but also of trust and confidence. \nThe reasoning about a potential alternative banking business \nbased on electronic markets relies on the insight that \nbanking, particularly at the customer interface, is the domain \nof financial intermediation which is not to be left to its own \ndevices but should be addressed in cooperation with \ncommercial as well as system-inter-, market-fund banks. \nThere will be inherent impediments for banks if information \nasymmetries are not removed from intermediation, and \nregulators either do not agree with trading or completely rule \nit out. To break out of the black sphere in a riskless world, \nbetter solutions than market-driven pricing are in need. \n6.2. Customer Experience Enhancement                               \nBanking has often been portrayed as a traditional, risk-\naverse industry with a conservative mindset. Although \ntraditional banks once had a higher growth rate than other \nindustries, they are now faced with declining growth, \ndiminishing customer loyalty, and stagnant share prices. As \ncustomers abandon their old banks and choose younger, \nmore innovative ones or even avoid banks altogether, the \nthreat of disintermediation looms. Banks are beginning to \n \n \nexperiment with different business models, such as full-\nservice Internet banks or investment banks, but also consider \nmoving up (universally) or down (niche) the value chain. \nWhat is needed, according to management consultants, is a \nchange of mentality among banks. However, this paper \nproposes a different remedy. The future need not be just an \nalternative business model for banks, but an opportunity to \nre-position themselves with a brand new business model that \nmeets customer needs. Consequently, banks, market \nparticipants, and the economy as a whole would benefit. \nThis is more likely, according to the authors, unless another \nfinancial crisis occurs or a regulator takes the current system \ninto its own hands. \nOn the one hand, as banks abandon or cease to develop \ntraditional customer-oriented markets in favor of less \ncompetitive service-oriented or non-banking business, new \nideas may arise that enable their reconsolidation. Several \ninterbank services currently in use, such as SWIFT, the \ncurrent accounts central bank model, securities settlement \nsystems, information systems, and networked cash machines \nare already electronic or on the verge of being automated. \nThese services have proven indispensable in operating multi-\nbanking relationships and managing financial market \ninfrastructure in an efficient and scalable manner. On the \nother hand, the dialectic between the ongoing integration of \ninterbank services and fragmentation of customer-facing \nprocesses must finish in order to recognize customer \ncooperation across providers. \n \n  Fig 4: Customer Experience Enhancement  in banking. \n7. Regulatory and Compliance Issues \nTo mitigate risks, preserve the integrity of the AI system, \nand prevent excessive risk-taking in the future, it is critical \nto implement regulatory guidelines for AI model governance \nin the financial service industry. The anticipated progress in \ntechnological developments of AI agents acting in a risk-\ntaking role will have implications for the investment \ndecision-making processes used by investment banks, but \nput organizations at the same time at risk of ethical \ndilemmas, increased market instabilities, and regulatory non-\ncompliance. First, AI agents equipped with high degrees of \nagency are expected to better identify investment \nopportunities. Human perception-based biases, such as \noverconfidence, market-herding, and representativeness will \nbe circumvented. The prerequisite condition for accurate \ninvestment decision-making is comprehensive access to \nmarket-relevant information spreads in the form of \nunstructured data. AI agents with access to entire internet \narchives may become indicative to detect nascent \ninformation flows system-wide, while powerful AI-\nintegrated trading systems allow for massive trading \nvolumes. However, the widespread use of agentic AI is \n\n \n \nexpected to create ethical dilemmas regarding the \ntransparency of investment decisions and compliance with \nregulations. Human management will be impeded by high \ndegrees of opacity and complexity of agentic AI systems. \nAddressing this issue is crucial as historical evidence shows \nthat processing capabilities can outweigh sophistication in \ntransparency. \nPressures resulting from the benign and negative spiraling of \nagentic AI trading decisions observed in finance, which \nincreased the speed of trading systems up to timescales of \nmilliseconds and resulted in cascading failures, reiterate the \npotential systems-wide implications of information \nimbalance. \nRegarding regulatory compliance, a race to the regulatory \nbottom may occur as firms with stricter compliance rules \njeopardize their competitive advantage by adopting less \ncompliant AI trading systems. Agentic AI is thereby \nexpected to influence not only investment banks, but also the \nwhole banking landscape, imposing an earlier onset of a \nmarket structure with a few highly competitive hyperbanks \ndominating the financial service industry. Such implications \nstress the urgency to develop a robust regulatory \nunderstanding of the implications of agentic AI models in \nbanking in order to efficiently balance economic competition \nand financial stability. \n7.1. Current Regulations                                                        \nBoosting competition and reducing barriers to entry for new \nfintech and payment service providers are the overall \nobjectives of regulatory responses to banking data sharing. \nBenefits for consumers, innovation, and competition in \nfinancial services could result from the regulatory approval \nof open banking at the EU level and its implementation in \neach member state. Universal banking is being tested \nthrough regulatory sandboxes in South Africa, Nigeria, and \nSingapore. Other fintech-friendly countries such as Kenya, \nBotswana, and Malaysia have issued regulation through \nstatutory guidance. This has the potential to greatly increase \nthe banks' competitive advantage and level of innovation. \n7.2. Future Regulatory Trends                                                        \nThe regulation of AI in the financial sector will be a key \ntopic of discussion in the Fields Institute workshop in May \n2024, as both risks and potential benefits of AI are \nidentified. An intelligent use of AI would allow for \nsignificant efficiency gains, stronger business models and \nimproved customer experience, potentially increasing \ncompetitive pressure on the EU’s financial sector. However, \nAI is also associated with a range of risks that impact players \nacross the financial ecosystem, including to the structure of \nthe financial system. While the ETF coalition is \nencountering a puzzle in its interaction with regulatory \nauthorities over how best to share data on self-regulatory \nmeasures regarding DLT, the risk of fragmentation of the \nsingle market from legislating DLT needs to be avoided at \nall costs. The ESAs should cooperate to develop and issue a \ndigital finance package on both topics, which would future-\nproof legislation and compliance obligations. \n A key area of focus would be on how to regulate generative \nand automated machine learning, potentially through \nprescribing more transparently explainable algorithms in \nsensitive areas such as wealth management or loan \napplications. Boardrooms would need to have adequate \nexpertise on evaluating the use of AI, the impact of machine \nlearning algorithms, and safeguards in place for robust \nidentification (i.e., explainability) and adjustment of \npotential bias or unexpected and unintended outcomes. \nEqu 3: Infrastructure Resilience Index (IRI). \n \n \n8. Technological Advancements \nTechnological advancements in banking services emerged \nsince the evolution of e-banking. The scope of technology \napplication in banking has widened with emergence of NIC \nterminals, internet banking, mobile banking, ATMs, and \nother technology-tailored services. Technology advancement \nhas changed the way banking business is done globally, \nwhere data Diasporas has become a great concern for \nmanagement and operations of the financial service industry. \nE-banking, which involves online transactions, are web-\nbased products of banks that allow the customers to conduct \nbanking transactions from home or office or anywhere or \nwhich provides the facility of anytime, anywhere banking to \nthe customers using any computing device such as PC, \nLaptops, Smart Phones, etc. This paper investigates the \ncurrent innovation trends in banks with reference to \ntechnology-tailored services. The technology advancement \naccepted by the bank consumers, was studied on the basis of \nits effect on channel preference. Moreover, the level of \nadoption for internet banking, NIC terminals, ATMs, Mobile \nbanking, SMS banking and Smart cards was estimated. All \nthe services newly introduced in banks were considered in \nthe discussion. \nNevertheless, system developers have to take care of diverse \nbackgrounds of consumers, language familiarity, age, \nfunctional classes, social class differences and employee \nunrest/ discontent over IT deployment in organizations. The \nphenomenal changes that have taken place in the Indian \nbanking sector since the last decade of 20th century with the \nadvent of new Information Technologies (IT), where in \nComputers through telecommunication links enabled online \nconnectivity of computers to branches of banks. Innovations \nin the banking sector have acted as a catalyst to convert the \nIndian banking sector in India from a level of mediocrity to \nacquisition of leadership in providing better quality \ninnovative products and services and thus driving the \nfinancial system in India into a higher economic competency \nlevel. Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in banking \nis impacting the face of modern day banks substantially. AI \nis the branch of computer science that’s dealing with \nsimulation of intelligent (human) behavior in computers. \n \n                    Fig 5: Banking Technology Trends. \n8.1. Emerging Technologies                                                              \nThe Future of Banking IT Services: Convergence of \nIntelligent Infrastructure and Agentic AI Models Economies \naround the world are burdened by an ever-burgeoning \nmountain of public and private debt; by major financial \ninstitutions deemed “too big to fail;” and by increasing \ndemands for transparency and for clearly delineated \nresponsibilities with respect to regulatory oversight. In \naddition, financial processes worldwide need to be \nstreamlined to achieve efficiency gains and cost \ncontainment. The current Sustainable Development Goals \nprovide an excellent framework for guiding the private \n\n \n \nsector investment decisions to create a paradigm shift from \nshort-term, volatile returns to sustainable business models \nproviding reliable, long-term returns within the bounds of \nplanetary limits. Notable examples of journals which have \nhad to adapt analog financial processes to the digital world \nare evident. This transformation is exemplified by automated \nfinancial news services which scour monthly earnings \nreports issued by public companies and from a neural \nunderstanding of accounting terminology and journalistic \nstandards compose an entire short financial article in real-\ntime. \nAwareness that the data revolution raises the specter of a \nduplicitous relationship with technology that can threaten \nhuman autonomy has sparked an emergent transdisciplinary \nresearch agenda focused on trustworthy AI systems. \nConcepts and tools drawn from Operations Research, \nPsychology, and Sociology need to be combined for co-\nconstructing next-generation intelligent infrastructures \ncapable of issuing autonomously and transparently \nactionable insights. This will involve co-developing next-\ngeneration Agentic AI models capable of calculating \narbitrarily complex automatable business processes by \nexecuting and interpreting a combination of multiple models \nconstituted by constraints formulated in different \nmathematical languages. To achieve these ambitious goals a \ncollaborative transdisciplinary research agenda needs to be \nestablished which is structured into seven mutually \nreinforcing research streams. Feedforward causal systems to \npropagate actionable insights in a forward most predictive \nmanner without any means of verification and adjustment \nare a potential source of insights. The next several decades \nwill involve an unprecedented investment effort on the part \nof world business and governments in advancing knowledge \nfor (a) generating ever more complex actionable insights; (b) \ncontext-fitting these insights to their local circumstances; \nand (c) acquiring an ever bigger understanding. \n8.2. Future Trends in Banking IT                                              \nThe banking and finance industry is bracing itself for a \nrevolution in smart predictive algorithms that tap into \nobservable sources of information in uncharted data spaces, \na torrent of real-time streaming data, and smart adaptive \nagentic AI models that are co-evolving in decentralized \nopen-source socio-technical ecosystems. Data spacious retail \nbanks are only capable of running elaborate predictive \nalgorithms to share the governance of the bank’s networked \nintelligent architecture consisting of its embedded AI-\ncapable datasets and observables. Dramatic cost reduction \nand competitive advantages are expected in economies of \nagglomerate data and observables through bespoke \nadvertising and modeling of consumer behavior beyond \none’s immediate peer group. Standalone observables, \nhowever, are severely attenuated by social desirability biases \nin retrospective descriptions of behavior. To emulate human-\nlike financial advice, modelling mood and identity remains \nan enduring challenge for AI engineers in banking. \nDemanding real-time advice from observables on emerging \nbehavior in streaming data spaces may enhance their \npredictive capabilities and understanding of hyper-complex \nsocial systems. Anticipating co-evolutionary societal states \nand behavior requires automatic strategy generation and \nubiquitous agentic model deployment across the bank’s \nembedded data and observables. Anticipating advisors can \neither propose strategic chats on observable governance \noutcomes in intelligent affinity group chats or amplify the \nawareness of affirmatively influential chats. Co-eventful \nagentic anticipatory models are expected to locally transform \nobservables into the predicted future states of wealthy \naffinity groups while defining networked early warning \nindicators that map observable governance patterns in the \npredictive game-theoretic landscapes of its embedded AI-\nfriendly datasets. Invisible effects on observable warfare \ntrades, mass shooting plots on banks, high-end securities \nthefts, and insider trading gatekeeping on the bank’s \ndisposition stock may explain the cost-effectiveness of \nagentic forewarnings in the unique optimization of \nsnowballing AI power against the bank’s market value. \nConvergence of intelligent infrastructures and general \nagentic financial advising AI models in the banking sector as \nforeseen may change the banking and finance paradigm. \nLike for conversational generative Agora and knowledge \nrevolution Bots, urgent attention to self-regulating \n \n \narchitectures and affordances of agentic anticipatory \nadvisory AI on the frontiers of ubiquitous AI in society to \nameliorate restraining collateral effects is necessary. \n9. Future Outlook \nThis section analyses two major mega-trends shaping next \ngeneration banking IT services. On the infrastructure side, \nthe uptake of Intelligent Infrastructure is increasing, which \nallows all IT service tasks and functions to be automated, \ninstrumented, and optimized for performance, quality, and \ncost. On the application side, the rise of Agentic AI, an \n‘augmented intelligence’ paradigm that allows high-level \nreasoning and self optimizing tasks by means of learning and \nbehavior patterns, is envisioned. \nOn the Banking IT Services Infrastructure side, past trends \nof increased automation, consolidation, and industrialization \nof outsourcing combined with extensive cloudification is \nstill changing the landscape and the cost base. Digital \nbusiness services such as packaged business processes, \nanalytics, and risk and compliance are showing continued \nstrong growth. As concluded in a separate article the overlap \nis very significant and possible convergence ensues. \nAutomating the insights gained by the AI models and the \nservice tasks at hand is the crux of efficient and cost-\neffective banking IT. Automated service management is \nenvisaged: all possible IT services will be monitored, \ninstrumented, and defined as a library of service recipes. \nNew service specifications will be passed on via a universal \nqueuing system to be optimized for performance, quality, \nand cost by pure data-driven and machine learning based \nintelligence. The highly intelligent proposals will then be \nvalidated against business expectations and budgets, and \noptimum combinations thereof will trigger the execution of \nthe identified next best actions and service tasks. \nOn the Banking Applications side, AI approaches, such as \nsoftware/hardware co-design, fine-grained parallelization \nand massive parallelization, deep learning and multi-step \nlearning, interpreted high level programming languages, \nsymmetry-inspired architectures, and hardware evolution, \nare compared with emerging AI agents such as \nmanufacturing agents, cloud-based architecture/cloud \nservices, self-learning and self-organizing agents, and \necosystems to meet the anticipated exponential growth in \nboth the underlying service domains and customer needs. \nNew degraded AI service paradigms (distributed and \nhybridized symbiosis agents/assisted AI) are identified as \npromising solutions to future proof AI. \n9.1. Predictions for Banking IT Services                                  \nThe business models of today’s banking organizations are \npredicated on their capabilities to view the business \nlandscape holistically, anticipate disruptive events that will \ndrive near- and longer-term changes in financial markets, \nadjust their resource allocation strategies to capitalize on \nexpected growth potential within this rapidly transforming \nenvironment, and align their performance goals accordingly. \nOne indication of where the world is headed is India, which \ndevised DIRCs, or digital payments on the domestic Unified \nPayments Interface (UPI), in a far more economically \nadvantageous way than the West. UPI is effectively an \nacclaimed digital payment system that enables responsible \nfiat currency and other asset transfer in a personal-to-\nbusiness, personal-to-personal, business-to-business, and \nbusiness-to-personal manner with direct access to bank \nservices. It eliminates the need for a payment card or digital \nwallet in a majority of cases, transferring the liability for \nensuring that funds and counterparty risk are safe or \nmanaged to the banking network. It makes it impossible to \noutsource required infrastructure to third parties. It \neliminates the myriad rents extracted by external gateways, \nterminals, and digital wallets and instead promotes the \ncompetition necessary to enforce low-cost services. UPI has \nmore than 60 million merchants, is used for 45% of all retail \npayment transactions, and has overtaken Western models of \nomnipresent payment terminals and cards. UPI has \nfacilitated remittance payment between migrant workers and \ntheir rural families and pilted jamboree lending and on-line \n \n \ndiary keeping in the microfinance sector. The nabard is \nutilizing UPI QR codes to effect direct benefit transfers to \nthe bank accounts of farmers (51% of which are woman-\nmanaged). Governments have adjusted protocols and \nverified payments through smart contracts on an emerging \nblockchain network. This tantalizing bouquet of prospective \nbanking services remains latent until telemetry, advanced \nstatistical techniques, big-data storage, and ubiquitous \nconnectivity combine to allow pricing and origination \ninnovation. In the forecasting scenario, governments are \nfeared to turn hostile against large banks under another crisis \nand be stripped off of their OSIG and payment gateways. If \nFedNow’s design remains unchanged, the market concave \nlow-cost infrastructure might very well appear and \ncannibalize the bank’s deposit- and fee-earning businesses. \nHypothetically, large banks could be dominant players in the \nover-the-counter markets of foreign currencies, interest rate \nswaps, and credit derivatives and impervious to on-line \ncustodial commodity trading platforms and margin \naccounting being designed. Primary dealers could devise \nstructures for expanded wealth management and asset price \nanchoring services, barred by regulation from becoming part \nof a bank. Or new virtual and off-shore banks could \nmushroom and attract offshore deposits, abetted by \nunbanked sovereigns and nations with fallaciously strong \ncurrencies pegged to gold or a basket, scripless currencies \nredeemable with gold, and cryptos convertible into sovereign \ncurrencies. The Artai1 would measure the probability of \nsuch events occurring (and their time sensitivity or \ndirectionality) and more importantly, their market potential \nand specification required to capitalize on it. \n9.2. Long-term Implications of AI Integration                           \nThere is little doubt that economic turbulence will \naccompany this massive, industry-wide transformation of the \nbanking ecosystem and its IT service supply chain. Large-\nscale changes invariably lead to significant disruptions and \npainful dislocations in the lives of individual human beings. \nEven more than individuals, organizations—both large and \nsmall—are likely to struggle to reposition themselves within \nthe evolving ecosystem. Most of these organizations offer a \nset of capabilities, bundled in a service offering, that are \nhighly complementary with the adjoining elements offering \nmore or less close substitutes at other levels of granularity. \nFor example, transforming the services offered on a bank’s \nmobile front-end app would require the bank’s mobile app \nprovider to take on new capabilities related to banking, \nmobile app development, and possibly customer service—\nand the implementation effort would preferably be \nundertaken in coordination with the other banks’ app \nvendors for the sake of simplicity. \nHistorically, the major IT service vendors involved in the \ndevelopment and upkeep of banking IT have concentrated on \nvery different levels of granularity and provided different \ntypes of service. As these vendors coalesce around the \nprovision of a set of tightly integrated offerings spanning the \nwhole eco-system from intelligent infrastructure to agentic \nAI models, the mind-share and purchase power of banks will \nbecome concentrated in a few major system integrators with \na huge bargaining power over the highly fractured supply \nchain at the low granularity end (Tier 2 service vendors). \nThe long-term implications of such a concentration are not \nclear: far-reaching changes to the market structure of \nbanking IT services may well affect pricing, quality, and \ntrust in ways that are hard to foresee, and are likely to have \nsubstantial political economic implications. Drawing from \nthe renowned social technology “foresight” method, such \nimplications should be considered plausible alternative \nfutures for future empirical investigation. \nCutting-edge AI models are being combined with ubiquitous \ncomputing, Faustian access to datasets, and monolithic \nsystems architectures. The growing power of agentic AI \nmodels is likely to lead to creative destruction across \nmultiple sectors of society, including but not limited to \nbanking. The historical precedent of the creative destruction \nassociated with top-down “intelligent” systems is that they \nreduce the human element in social technologies, typically \nreducing the discretion of the professional and management \nclass, and leading to the concentration of key decision-\nmaking and execution activities that were normally \ndistributed across society. The implications of such changes, \n \n \nusually leading to heightened inequity and polarization, \ncarry political economic ramifications that are rarely \ndiscussed openly. \n10. Conclusion \nBanking IT services have undergone significant \ntransformations aimed at creating advanced banking IT \ninfrastructures. Future-compliant banking IT infrastructures \nmust encompass both intelligent infrastructures and agentic \nAI innovation services. Intelligent infrastructures are \nessential for banks, as they enable the use of new software \ntechnologies that facilitate emergent business models, \nmarkets, and ecosystems by integrating, aggregating, and \nstructuring data. These infrastructures can be flexible, \nadaptive, polymorphic, and durable. The usefulness, \ncompetitiveness, and long-term viability of banking IT \nservices will largely depend on their basic IT infrastructure. \nIntelligent banking IT infrastructures can be developed \nbottom-up, and a multi-layer approach for both the \ninfrastructure and the corresponding software building \nblocks is suggested. \n \n        Fig 6: The Future of Banking IT Services using \nAgentic AI Models. \nBanking IT services must also be agentic. Improving the \nintelligibility of existing IT services is necessary, which \nmeans rendering aspects of the services more accessible or \neasy to understand. However, explaining why a certain \ndecision has been made is not enough; models must also be \ncomprehensible in terms of their internal functioning. \nIdentifying and managing risks and problems caused by AI \nmodels is another vital aspect. The ability to act \nautonomously carries good and bad side effects, including \nrisks and challenges. Banking AI services must be agentic in \nthe sense that humans perceive them to be active and alive, \nwhich means that their integration and use induce new forms \nof market participation and customer interaction. Together, \nagentic AI service models and intelligent infrastructures \nrepresent a profoundly transformational improvement over \nexisting IT systems. \nDespite the urgent need for intelligent infrastructures and \nagentic AI services, most existing banking IT services today \nare either not intelligent or nostalgic. Legacy mainframe \nsystems, while not obsolete yet, are becoming cumbersome. \nLegacy of mindset, culture, understanding, and espoused \nvalues in organizations and societies often guarantee that \ntexts, planning procedures, roles, and hierarchies are \nretained. 'As-is'-models describe a conservatively prepared \norganization, and the goal is to transform from this \nunsatisfactory state into a target IT service. Largely, re-\nengineering takes place in overly-optimistic frames, and \nfuture visions are continuously painted into the past by an \nongoing avor of soup-in-place. Action, condition, value, and \ntime-no longer pass-persist is always narratively over-\nrepresented. \nMore than 242 million transactions worth over 42 billion \nEuros through the mobile banking application in 2021 \nunderlines the importance of developing further mobile \nonline banking services. These applications must also be \nshaped into open smart platforms to prove their \ncomparability with Niched Startup FinTechs. There is also \nan urgent need for opening up information systems and \nprocesses further to third party providers. Otherwise, \nincreased competition from other economies can be \nexpected. \n11.
