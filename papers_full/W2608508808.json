There is wide interest in\nmethods for reviewing ‘complex interventions ’, but few transparent approaches for assessing intervention\ncomplexity in systematic reviews. Such assessments may assist review authors in, for example, systematically\ndescribing interventions and developing logic models. This paper describes the development and application of\nthe intervention Complexity Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews (iCAT_SR), a new tool to assess and categorise\nlevels of intervention complexity in systematic reviews.\nMethods: We developed the iCAT_SR by adapting and extending an existing complexity assessment tool for\nrandomized trials. We undertook this adaptation using a consensus approach in which possible complexity\ndimensions were circulated for feedback to a panel of methodologists with expertise in complex interventions and\nsystematic reviews. Based on these inputs, we developed a draft version of the tool. We then invited a second\nround of feedback from the panel and a wider group of systematic reviewers. This informed further refinement of\nthe tool.\nResults: The tool comprises ten dimensions: (1) the number of active components in the intervention; (2) the\nnumber of behaviours of recipients to which the intervention is directed; (3) the range and number of\norganizational levels targeted by the intervention; (4) the degree of tailoring intended or flexibility permitted across\nsites or individuals in applying or implementing the intervention; (5) the level of skill required by those delivering\nthe intervention; (6) the level of skill required by those receiving the intervention; (7) the degree of interaction\nbetween intervention components; (8) the degree to which the effects of the intervention are context dependent;\n(9) the degree to which the effects of the interventions are changed by recipient or provider factors; (10) and the\nnature of the causal pathway between intervention and outcome. Dimensions 1 – 6 are considered ‘core’\ndimensions. Dimensions 7 – 10 are optional and may not be useful for all interventions.\nConclusions: The iCAT_SR tool facilitates more in-depth, systematic assessment of the complexity of interventions\nin systematic reviews and can assist in undertaking reviews and interpreting review findings. Further testing of the\ntool is now needed.\nKeywords: Complex interventions, Systematic review, Tool, Intervention development, Evidence synthesis, Complex,\nIntervention, Complexity\n* Correspondence: simon.lewin@fhi.no\n1Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway\n2Health Systems Research Unit, South African Medical Research Council,\nCape Town, South Africa\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2017) 17:76 \nDOI 10.1186/s12874-017-0349-x\nBackground\n‘Complex interventions ’ in health have been debated\nwidely for several years. Key points of discussion include\nhow to define such interventions, how to evaluate their\neffects and how to synthesise these effects within\nsystematic reviews [1 – 5]. Some common features of\ncomplex interventions in health identified some years\nago by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and\nwidely quoted [6] include: having a number of compo-\nnents that may act both dependently and independently;\nhaving “active ingredients ” that are not easy to define;\nbeing interventions that may be delivered at the individ-\nual, organisational or population level; and being\ntargeted towards patients directly or indirectly through\nhealth professionals or health systems.\nThere are many other definitions of complex interven-\ntions, often highlighting multiple, interacting compo-\nnents and non-linear causal pathways, and emphasising\nvariability in content, context and mode of delivery, as\nwell as the unpredictability of their effects [2, 7, 8].\nOther approaches have sought to differentiate complex,\ncomplicated and simple interventions [9, 10]. For ex-\nample, it has been suggested that interventions with\nmany component parts that may require a high level of\nskill in delivery but have little variation in application or\noutcome are ‘complicated’ rather than ‘complex’, and that\ninterventions with few components that can be delivered\nin a formulaic manner with predictable outcomes are\n‘simple’. Complex interventions or systems, in contrast,\nhave features of non-linearity, context dependency,\nadaptability and interdependence of intervention ele-\nments [11]. Further work has focused on ways to graph-\nically depict complex interventions, including how they\nare delivered [12, 13]. While useful, these approaches are\nnot focused on understanding intervention complexity\nin the context of systematic reviews. Furthermore, inter-\nvention complexity has many dimensions, and interven-\ntions may show more complexity on some of these\ndimensions than on others. It is therefore difficult and\nprobably not useful to create a simple definition of what\nwe might view as a complex intervention. Instead, the\ntool described in this paper outlines the key dimensions\nof intervention complexity and describes how these\nmight be assessed. Using the tool, interventions can be\ndescribed as having degrees of complexity in relation to\nthese dimensions.\nIn other strands of methodological work, we have\nproposed a new conceptual approach to categorising and\ndescribing intervention complexity [14]. This approach\ndistinguishes between the description and analysis of: a)\nintervention complexity (i.e. situations in which we ex-\npect the effects of an intervention to be modified by\nvariant properties or characteristics of the intervention\nitself); b) complexity in implementation (i.e. situations in\nwhich we expect the effects of an intervention to be\nmodified by variant characteristics of implementation\nprocesses); c) complexity in context (i.e. situations in\nwhich we expect the effects of an intervention to be\nmodified by variant properties or characteristics of the\nsettings or contexts in which an intervention is\nimplemented); and d) complexity in relation to partici-\npants’ characteristics (i.e. situations in which we expect\nthe effects of an intervention to be modified by variant\ncharacteristics of participants receiving an intervention).\nThis approach has informed the development of the tool\ndescribed in this paper.\nBeing able to describe and replicate interventions that\nare seen as lying towards the more complex end of the\nsimple-complex continuum is important because of the\nwide use of such interventions in health and social care\nand because of the growing interest in understanding\nboth their effectiveness and how these effects come\nabout [15]. Systematic review methods are frequently\nused to quantify these effects. However, to be useful to\nthose deciding whether and how to implement interven-\ntions, such reviews also require precise descriptions of\nthe interventions [16] and an understanding of why an\nintervention should be considered complex. Describing\nand assessing these interventions is challenging though\nbecause they may have many interacting components\nand because they need to be described and assessed in\nrelation to how they are implemented, the context in\nwhich they are implemented and those delivering and\nreceiving the intervention [15]. Clark [9] argues that\nresearch into complex health interventions still focuses\non easily described components of interventions and\nrisks overlooking the key issue of which components are\nmost strongly associated with the effects of the interven-\ntion. In other words, ways of describing complex\ninterventions need to help us ultimately in understand-\ning their mechanisms of action and effects – how and\nwhy they work in a given context.\nThe MRC guidance for developing and evaluating\ncomplex interventions, updated in 2008 [6, 17], has been\ninfluential in taking forward this field but conducting\nsystematic reviews that fully address the complexity of\ninterventions remains challenging [3, 14, 18]. In particu-\nlar, systematic reviews need to be able to describe com-\nplexity accurately and consistently across included\nprimary studies in order to facilitate the grouping of\nstudies for analysis, investigate causes of heterogeneity,\nand explore the relationship between intervention com-\nplexity and fidelity of implementation [19, 20]. The new\napproach to categorising intervention complexity\ndescribed above [14] may help authors understand the\ncontextual considerations contributing to intervention\nmechanisms and effects [3, 21]. In addition, an approach\nhas been developed for identifying key intervention\nLewin et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2017) 17:76 Page 2 of 13\ncontent and implementation processes [22]. However,\ncurrently there is no widely accepted and used tool or\ntypology for assessing and categorizing levels of\nintervention complexity.\nThis paper describes the development of the interven-\ntion Complexity Assessment Tool for Systematic\nReviews (iCAT_SR). The tool aims to provide an overall\npicture of the complexity of an intervention that can be\ndepicted visually, for example in a chart, or contribute to\ndeveloping or refining a logic model. In addition, the\ntool may contribute to understanding intervention\nheterogeneity and informing decisions about the\nimplementation of effective interventions.\nAim\nTo describe the development and application of the\niCAT_SR tool to assess and categorise levels of interven-\ntion complexity in systematic reviews.\nMethods\nWe developed the iCAT in two stages: in the first stage,\nwe developed an initial version of the tool to assess\nintervention complexity in randomised trials [7]. The\nsteps we undertook in developing this tool are detailed\nin Additional file 1. The output of this stage comprised a\nguidance document describing six dimensions of com-\nplexity (Additional file 2) and a template for rating each\ndimension using a system with three levels. We consid-\nered and excluded a further ten dimensions, mainly\nbecause they were already covered by an included\ndimension, were thought too difficult to assess object-\nively or pre-trial, or did not to relate directly to the\ncomplexity of an intervention (Additional file 3).\nIn the second stage, we adapted and further developed\nthe existing iCAT tool so that it could be used to\ndescribe and assess intervention complexity in\nsystematic reviews. We undertook the following steps:\n/C15Consensus approach: We circulated the iCAT\ndimensions identified as being relevant to describing\nthe complexity of interventions in single, primary\nevaluation studies [ 7] (Additional file 2) for feedback\nand comment to an expert panel of methodologists\nworking in the areas of complex interventions and\nsystematic reviews. Through a series of group and\nindividual telephone calls, we obtained feedback on\nwhether the iCAT tool could be adapted for\napplication in systematic reviews of complex\ninterventions; and how best to integrate the tool\ninto the review process. A total of 18 people\nparticipated in the discussions and/or provided\nfeedback on the tool. We then collated and\ncirculated all comments for confirmation of\nfeedback and also invited additional comments.\n/C15Drafting of first version of the iCAT_SR: Based on\nthe feedback received, we revised the iCAT for\nsingle studies to include four additional dimensions\nseen to be useful in the context of systematic\nreviews. These were: (1) the degree of interaction\nbetween intervention components; (2) the degree to\nwhich the effects of the intervention are dependent\non the context or setting in which it is implemented;\n(3) the degree to which the effects of the\nintervention are changed by recipient or provider\nfactors; and (4) the nature of the causal pathway\nbetween the intervention and the outcome it is\nintended to effect.\n/C15Second round of feedback on the draft iCAT_SR: We\ncirculated a draft version of the tool, incorporating\nthe agreed amendments, among the expert panel as\nwell as to a wider group of systematic reviewers\nwith an expressed interest in complex interventions.\nWe approached the latter through a ‘complex\nintervention’ e-mail list. We then invited all those\nwho had contributed to join a meeting at the 2012\nCochrane Colloquium (which around 50 people\nattended), where the development work was\npresented and the tool demonstrated through\napplication to two empirical examples. Group\ndiscussion following the presentation resulted in\nadditional feedback which informed further\nrefinement of the tool.\nResults\nDimensions of the iCAT_SR version 1\nThe revised tool comprises six ‘core’ and four ‘optional’\ndimensions for assessing intervention complexity. The\ncore dimensions, which include those in the original\niCAT tool, and the optional dimensions, seen to be use-\nful in the context of systematic reviews specifically, are\ndescribed briefly below and in more detail in Tables 1\nand 2. A detailed description of the tool and guidance\non how to apply it can be found in Additional file 4.\nCore dimensions:\n1. Active components included in the intervention, in\nrelation to the comparison: An intervention\ncomponent is defined as a discrete, active element of\nthe intervention that could be implemented\nindependently of other elements. Components vary\nin number and could be delivered independently of\neach other or be grouped together in organised\nbundles or looser packages of care.\n2. Behaviour or actions of intervention recipients or\nparticipants to which the intervention is directed:\nBehaviours or actions include taking a medication,\nchanging a particular practice, improving knowledge\nor undergoing a surgical procedure; they may also\nLewin et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2017) 17:76 Page 3 of 13\ninclude not undertaking a behaviour, such as not\nsmoking. Behaviours or actions are targeted by the\nactive components of the intervention.\n3.

Different levels of skills may\nbe required to deliver different interventions.\n6. The level of skill required for the targeted behaviour\nwhen entering the included studies by those\nreceiving the intervention (consumers, professionals,\nplanners) in order to meet the intervention objectives:\nThose receiving an intervention, such as an\neducational programme, may need skills, based on\ntraining, experience or practice, to interpret the\ninformation provided and then to apply it in their\nsetting. For example, consumers may need a certain\nlevel of internet and heath literacy to access and use\nhealth information. Again, different levels of skills\nmay be required for different interventions.\nOptional dimensions:\n7. The degree of interaction between intervention\ncomponents, including the independence/\ninterdependence of intervention components: The\neffectiveness of an intervention may depend on the\ncombination of components delivered and/or the\nsequence of delivery. There may be synergistic\n(“added value ”) or dysynergistic effects from\ndelivering intervention components in a particular\ncombination, and one component delivered alone\ncould be effective, ineffective or even harmful\n(Table 3).\n8. The degree to which the effects of the intervention are\ndependent on the context or setting in which it is\nimplemented: The effects of an intervention may be\ndependent on the societal, political, economic,\nhealth system or environmental context in which\nthe intervention is delivered. For example, an\nintervention may not have the same effects in\nprimary care clinics and tertiary level hospitals, or in\na health system in which care is free at the point of\ncontact compared to one in which that is not the\ncase.\n9. The degree to which the effects of the intervention\nare changed by recipient or provider factors : The\neffects of an intervention may be dependent on the\nrecipient’s readiness for behaviour change or the\nproficiency of the person delivering the intervention.\n10.The nature of the causal pathway between the\nintervention and the outcome it is intended to effect:\nThis refers to pathways that involve human actions\n(such as behaviours) or actions within organisations\nor systems rather than biological pathways. The\ncausal pathway for an intervention may be clear,\ndirect, short and linear or it may be longer, more\nvariable, or there may be more than one causal\npathway [ 23– 25].\nGrading the complexity of interventions using iCAT_SR\nFor each iCAT_SR dimension an intervention can be\ngraded on one of three levels, ranging from more simple\nto more complex (Tables 1 and 2). For some compo-\nnents, it is also possible to select ‘varies’ where that\nparticular component varies across interventions to be\nconsidered for the review or ‘unclear or unable to assess ’\nwhen the information needed to make an assessment is\nnot available. Review authors should provide support for\ntheir judgements regarding these assessments so as to\nimprove transparency and help readers understand the\njudgements made (Additional file 4). Information for the\nsupport for judgement may be drawn from multiple\nsources: published study reports; ancillary papers on the\nstudies, including qualitative process evaluations; and\ninformation obtained from study authors. Where a re-\nview of effectiveness has a linked qualitative evidence\nsynthesis that explores how the intervention works and\nfactors affecting its implementation, this additional in-\nformation may be very helpful in making assessments\nfor the complexity dimensions. This is shown in the\nexample in Table 4 which draws on data from both a\nCochrane review of effectiveness [26] and a Cochrane\nqualitative evidence synthesis [25].\nAt the development and protocol stages of a review,\nreview authors may not have sufficient information to\nmake definitive judgements regarding a dimension. In\nthese cases, we recommend that the review team make a\nprovisional judgement or develop a hypothesis and then\nnote these hypotheses in their support for judgement.\nInformation emerging at the analysis stage, such as the\nTable 3 Interactions and interdependencies within complex\ninterventions (adapted from [40, 41])\nComplex interventions can include components that interact\nsynergistically or dysynergistically, as follows:\n Synergistic: Intervention components interact in ways that the total\neffect is greater than the sum of the individual effects of the\ncomponents.\n Dysynergistic: Intervention components act in ways that the total\neffect is less than the sum of the individual effects of the components.\nWhere intervention components do not interact in these ways, one\nwould expect the effect of the intervention to be the sum of the\nindividual effects of all of the components.\nComplex interventions can also include components that are\ninterdependent. Where such interdependencies exist, they can be\ndescribed as:\n Contemporaneous: The effect of one intervention component depends\non another intervention component being present at the same time.\nOn their own, each component may be less effective, ineffective, or\nharmful.\n Temporal: The effect of one intervention component depends on\nanother component being present beforehand. On their own, each\ncomponent may be less effective, ineffective, or harmful.\nWhere intervention components do not show interdependency, one\nwould expect these components to be effective regardless of the\npresence or absence of other components.\nLewin et al.

This is discussed in more detail below.\nUsing the iCAT_SR in systematic reviews of effectiveness\nUse of the iCAT_SR in the context of systematic reviews\nof effectiveness is intended to facilitate a more system-\natic and thorough understanding of intervention com-\nplexity, including in relation to both the content of an\nintervention and its mode of delivery. Table 5 shows\nhow the tool may be useful at different stages in the\nprocess of conducting a systematic review, including in\nprotocol development, analysis and in interpreting and\npresenting the review findings. For instance, the tool\ncould be used to compare the complexity characteristics\nof the included studies with those specified using\niCAT_SR at the protocol stage. This may help to identify\nareas in which the intervention description needs to be\nimproved for the next review update. Examples of how\niCAT_SR can be applied within systematic reviews are\nprovided in Tables 4 and 5 and Additional file 5. The ex-\nample in Table 4 focuses on a health systems interven-\ntion [25, 26] while that in Additional file 5 focuses on a\npublic health intervention directed to consumers and\ncommunities [27, 28].\nAt the development and protocol stages of a review,\nthe iCAT_SR can prompt review authors to identify the\ndimensions of complexity that are associated with a par-\nticular intervention. This may improve review authors ’\nunderstanding of how to conceptualise and define the\nintervention they are considering. This, in turn, may im-\nprove their description of the intervention in the review\nprotocol (which could follow the format used in Table 4\nand Additional file 5) and the identification of eligible\nstudies. As noted above, review authors may select ‘var-\nies’ where a particular iCAT_SR component varies\nacross the group of interventions to be considered for a\nreview. This grading should prompt review authors to\nconsider whether it is appropriate for these interventions\nto be grouped together in a single review and also,\nwhere relevant, whether these interventions would be\nbetter considered as separate intervention-comparison\ncombinations within a review. Where a review includes\nmore than one intervention-comparison combination, it\nis may be appropriate to undertake separate iCAT_SR\nassessments for each combination.\nAt the development stage of a review, applying the\niCAT_SR may also help identify possible explanatory\nfactors for differences in results across studies and\nsubgroups, and these can then be specified for a priori\nsubgroup analyses. For instance, the iCAT_SR example\nin Table 4 notes, based on findings from a linked quali-\ntative evidence synthesis, that the effects of some lay\nhealth worker interventions may be modified by the\nTable 5 Using the iCAT_SR in systematic reviews of the effectiveness of interventions\nStage in the review process a Utility of the iCAT_SR\nFormulating the PICO review question and\ndeveloping criteria for including studies\nPrompts review authors to identify the key components of the intervention/s and how these interact;\nthe actions to which these components are directed; the organisational levels targeted; the anticipated\ncausal pathway/s or logic model etc. Overall, this may help review authors to conceptualise the\nintervention and define the scope of the review.\nSearching for studies By prompting to review authors to identify the key components of intervention/s and the recipients and\norganisational levels targeted, the tool may aid in identifying appropriate search terms. This may help in\nidentifying eligible studies where, for example, the interventions of interest are broadly similar in terms of\ntheir component parts but have widely varying names in the literature.\nSelecting studies for inclusion Makes explicit the key components of the intervention/s and the recipients and organisational levels\ntargeted, and therefore helps to ensure that study inclusion decisions are easier and more consistent\nacross the review author team.\nExtracting data Facilitates the organisation and standardisation of data relating to intervention description and\nintervention complexity. The dimensions of the tool can inform development of the data extraction form\nfor the review.\nAnalysing data and undertaking\nmeta-analyses\nEnables classification or grouping of interventions for analysis based on their components and/or\nparticipants and levels targeted. The tool may also inform analyses and interpretation by helping to\ngenerate a priori hypotheses about explanatory factors that could potentially explain differences in results\nboth across studies and across subgroups within studies. These explanatory factors can then be used to\nexplore heterogeneity in subgroup analyses and meta-regressions.\nPresenting results and developing ‘Summary\nof findings ’ tablesb\nEnables classification or grouping of interventions based on their components and/or participants and\nlevels targeted, and thus facilitates clear and logical presentation of the review findings. The tool may\nalso identify important research gaps, for example where the causal pathway of an intervention is not\nclear or where there are important questions regarding interactions between intervention components.\nInterpreting results and drawing conclusions Aids refining a logic model or causal pathway for the intervention/s that was developed at the protocol\nstage.\naThe stages in this table are based on those for Cochrane reviews, but are also relevant to most other reviews of the effectiveness of interventions\nbA summary of findings table shows the quality of evidence and magnitude of relative and absolute effects for each outcome in a review assessed as import ant\nby stakeholders [ 44]\nLewin et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2017) 17:76 Page 9 of 13\ndegree of social support that lay health workers receive.\nThis might therefore be an important explanatory factor\nto include in subgroup analyses in a systematic review of\nthe effects of lay health worker interventions.\nWe recognise that limited knowledge of how an inter-\nvention works may reduce review authors ’ ability to\ncomplete the assessment for each complexity dimension\nat the protocol stage, and that these assessments are a\nreflexive process involving judgements. We recommend\nthat review authors complete the assessments as far as\npossible, based on existing knowledge, including from\nsources such as linked qualitative evidence syntheses, or\nlogical argument and then consider during the analysis\nstage of the review whether any changes are needed. For\nexample, the findings of a systematic review of interven-\ntion effectiveness or of a linked qualitative evidence syn-\nthesis may suggest that an intervention-effects causal\npathway hypothesized at the protocol stage was incor-\nrect or incomplete. Applying the iCAT_SR might also\ninfluence decisions on when to incorporate qualitative\nevidence to explain gaps in knowledge.\nThe iCAT_SR is designed to be applied in reviews of a\nsingle intervention or of a group of very similar inter-\nventions. Some reviews, however, consider any interven-\ntion aimed at achieving a particular outcome. For\nexample, any intervention that aims to improve adher-\nence to tuberculosis treatment (which might include\nmobile phone messaging, nurse visits or written patient\ninformation) or any intervention that aims to improve\ntrust between health care providers and health care\nrecipients (which might include training interventions\nfor health care providers and patient education). For\nthese types of review, it will be necessary to group\ntogether similar interventions (e.g., all mobile phone\nmessaging interventions for tuberculosis treatment\nadherence or all interventions that involve training for\nhealth care providers) and to carry out separate\niCAT_SR assessments for each of the included interven-\ntion groups. It should also be noted that iCAT_SR is not\na tool to assess risk of bias or how well an evaluaton\nstudy or systematic review has been conducted.\nDiscussion\nThe iCAT_SR version 1 can guide the conduct of sys-\ntematic reviews of effectiveness by providing review au-\nthors with a technique to ‘disaggregate systematically ’\n[18] and describe key aspects of an intervention. It will\nallow review authors and others to characterize complex\ninterventions in a uniform framework – a possibility that\nhas been largely lacking to date. The iCAT_SR will also\nimprove understanding of the relationship between\nintervention components and make more explicit con-\nsiderations of context and of implementation factors.\nThe tool may also be helpful in planning subgroup\nanalyses to explore effect modification by key differences\nin intervention complexity – for example, participants\nexposed to different combinations of intervention com-\nponents or to interventions targeting different organisa-\ntional levels. iCAT_SR assessments may also be useful in\nplanning meta-regression to explore the relative import-\nance of different dimensions of intervention complexity\nin explaining intervention effects, and in conceptualising\nnetwork meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of\ndifferent intervention configurations [29]. All of this\nmay contribute to explaining more clearly which inter-\nvention components work and how. Furthermore, by im-\nproving the quality of intervention description in\nsystematic reviews, it may also facilitate judgements\nabout applicability of the findings in populations or sub-\ngroups [30].\nThe development of this tool needs to be situated in\nthe evolving science of systematic reviews that proposes\nthe synthesis of multiple sources of data to explain the\ncausal relationship between an intervention and its\neffects [18, 31]. Other approaches to assessing the com-\nplexity of interventions tend to be specific to a clinical\nor health area [32, 33], and more work is needed to\nexplore how these approaches might be used together\nwith the iCAT_SR. In addition, for behaviour change\ninterventions we need to explore how the iCAT_SR can\nbe used in conjunction with behaviour change interven-\ntion frameworks [34] and a taxonomy of behaviour\nchange techniques [35 – 37]. We also acknowledge that\nthis attempt to assess the degree of complexity of inter-\nventions somewhat artificially both splits complexity into\na range of dimensions and divides complexity on each\ndimension into three levels. In practice, all interventions\nsit on a spectrum from less to more complex for each of\nthe dimensions specified making it difficult to meaning-\nfully talk about a ‘complex intervention ’ or an overall\ndegree, or level of, intervention complexity. Nonetheless\nwe see the iCAT_SR as a constructive step in developing\na better understanding of the phenomenon of interven-\ntion complexity.\nThe next stage of development will be to further test\nthe iCAT_SR, and the guidance on how to apply it, in\nselected systematic reviews and also to assess reliability\nbetween raters and identify sources of disagreement. We\nhave received offers from a number of review author\nteams who would like to trial the current version as part\nof a review of a health intervention, and hope that these\npilots will explore both the usability or feasibility of the\ntool and its usefulness in exploring the nature of the\ncausal pathways for an intervention and assessing the\napplicability of review findings. The usefulness and us-\nability of the tool for users of systematic reviews also\nneeds to be explored. An iCAT_SR assessment may as-\nsist users of reviews in a number of ways: by facilitating\nLewin et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology  (2017) 17:76 Page 10 of 13\nclearer description of the intervention that is the focus of\nthe review; by making more explicit aspects of the inter-\nvention that may be important for replication in other set-\ntings, including the (hypothesized) active components, the\nbehaviours or actions to which the intervention is directed\nand the level of skill required by those delivering the inter-\nvention (dimensions 1, 2 and 5); and by highlighting gaps\nin knowledge about an intervention, for example regard-\ning the nature of the causal pathway between the\nintervention and the outcome it is intended to effect\n(dimension 10) [30]. To aid use of the iCAT_SR, results of\nassessments could be depicted visually, for example in a\nchart or pictograph [38], and creating visual presentations\nwill be an important part of future development of the\ntool. Further work is also needed to evaluate the useful-\nness to review users of iCAT_SR assessments and\ndifferent methods of presenting these.\nThe development of the iCAT_SR has been under-\ntaken by experienced review authors; we also therefore\nneed to assess whether it can be operationalised success-\nfully in the hands of relatively inexperienced review\nauthors as well as the additional workload involved. It is\nlikely that review authors will require some training to\nuse the tool as intended, and there will be a learning\ncurve before the value of the tool becomes apparent. Be-\ncause judgements are involved in applying iCAT_SR, we\nrecommend that review authors meet at the outset and\ndiscuss with some examples how they plan to make their\njudgements. This should promote agreement within a\nreview team, and make clearer what their judgements\nmean in the context of a particular review. In addition,\nwe are not advocating that the tool should be used in all\nreviews of interventions that are viewed as more com-\nplex. Rather, the iCAT_SR should be considered in\nreviews where understanding the complexity of the\nintervention, and understanding the impacts of this\ncomplexity on intervention effects, are important parts\nof the review question.\nThe iCAT_SR is not without limitations, the most im-\nportant of which is likely to be the limited description of\nintervention components, implementation context and\nimplementation fidelity in primary studies included in a\nreview. Poor reporting is a well acknowledged problem\n[15, 39] and developing ‘complexity’ extensions to the\nCONSORT and PRISMA criteria [14] and reporting\ntemplates [15] may help to address this through driving\nup reporting standards. An additional use of the\niCAT_SR will be in identifying gaps in reporting and in\nproviding a clear picture of issues to probe when\ncontacting the authors of primary studies.\nConclusions\nThe development of the iCAT_SR tool facilitates more\nin-depth, systematic assessment of the complexity of\ninterventions in systematic reviews of intervention ef-\nfects and may also contribute to understanding how a\ncomplex intervention works. In addition, the tool may\nhave a number of ‘spin off ’ effects including improving\nunderstanding of the range of different versions of an\nintervention in the literature; improving intervention\ndescription in primary studies; and making it easier for\nusers of reviews to assess the applicability of the inter-\nvention to their setting. The iCAT_SR also moves the\nfield away from ‘simplistic’ definitions of what we might\nview as a complex intervention and suggests that inter-\nventions are better described as having degrees of\ncomplexity in relation to the iCAT_SR dimensions.\nWe have added to the title of the tool the suffix\n‘version 1 ’ as we anticipate that reviewers who use the\ntool will comment and suggest additional modifications.\nWe encourage publication of worked examples of the\napplication of iCAT_SR to different types of interven-\ntions (for instance, interventions targeting different\ngovernance or financial arrangements for health and\nsocial care) from different areas of health and social care\n(for example, clinical medicine, health systems and pub-\nlic health). We also welcome feedback on the tool and\nthe accompanying guidance (Additional file 4) and plan\nto review and update these at regular intervals, based on\nuser experience.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Development of a tool to describe and assess the\ncomplexity of interventions in randomised trials (PDF 338 kb)\nAdditional file 2: iCAT dimensions for assessing the complexity of\ninterventions in the context of randomised trials (PDF 420 kb)\nAdditional file 3: Dimensions considered and excluded from the iCAT\nfor assessing the complexity of interventions in the context of\nrandomised trials (PDF 241 kb)\nAdditional file 4: Guidance for using the iCAT_SR tool: intervention\nComplexity Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews, version 1.0 (PDF 362 kb)\nAdditional file 5: Applying the iCAT_SR – example B: systematic review\nof the effects of interventions aimed at communities to inform and/or\neducate about early childhood vaccination and qualitative evidence\nsynthesis of parents ’ and informal caregivers ’ views and experiences of\nroutine early childhood vaccination communication.
