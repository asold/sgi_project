    "abstract": "The design of rolling stock plays a key role in the attractiveness of the rail transport. Train design must strictly meet the requirements of rail operators to ensure high quality and cost-effective services. Semiconductor power devices made from silicon carbide (SiC) have reached a level of technology enabling their widespread use in traction power converters. SiC transistors offering energy savings, quieter operation, improved reliability and reduced maintenance costs have become the choice for the next-generation railway power converters and are quickly replacing the IGBT technology which has been used for decades. The paper describes the design and development of a novel SiC-based DC power electronic traction transformer (PETT) intended for electric multiple units (EMUs) operated in 3 kV DC rail traction. The details related to the 0.5 MVA peak power medium voltage prototype, including the electrical design of the main building blocks are presented in the first part of the paper. The second part deals with the implementation of the developed SiC-based DC PETT into a regional train operating on a 3 kV DC traction system. The experimental results obtained during the testing are presented to demonstrate the performance of the developed 3 kV DC PETT prototype.",
