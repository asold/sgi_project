    "abstract": "Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is the task of detecting and correcting various grammatical errors in texts. Many previous approaches to the GEC have used various mechanisms including rules, statistics, and their combinations. Recently, the performance of the GEC in English has been drastically enhanced due to the vigorous applications of deep neural networks and pretrained language models. Following the promising results of the English GEC tasks, we apply the Transformer with Copying Mechanism into the Korean GEC task by introducing novel and effective noising methods for constructing Korean GEC datasets. Our comparative experiments showed that the proposed system outperforms two commercial grammar check and other NMT-based models.",
