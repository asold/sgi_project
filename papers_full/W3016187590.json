  "abstract": "Background Doctors must care for many patients simultaneously, and it is time-consuming to find and examine all patients’ medical histories. Discharge diagnoses provide hospital staff with sufficient information to enable handling multiple patients; however, the excessive amount of words in the diagnostic sentences poses problems. Deep learning may be an effective solution to overcome this problem, but the use of such a heavy model may also add another obstacle to systems with limited computing resources. Objective We aimed to build a diagnoses-extractive summarization model for hospital information systems and provide a service that can be operated even with limited computing resources. Methods We used a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based structure with a two-stage training method based on 258,050 discharge diagnoses obtained from the National Taiwan University Hospital Integrated Medical Database, and the highlighted extractive summaries written by experienced doctors were labeled. The model size was reduced using a character-level token, the number of parameters was decreased from 108,523,714 to 963,496, and the model was pretrained using random mask characters in the discharge diagnoses and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems sets. We then fine-tuned the model using summary labels and cleaned up the prediction results by averaging all probabilities for entire words to prevent character level–induced fragment words. Model performance was evaluated against existing models BERT, BioBERT, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) L score, and a questionnaire website was built to collect feedback from more doctors for each summary proposal. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of the summary proposals were 0.928, 0.941, 0.899, and 0.947 for BERT, BioBERT, LSTM, and the proposed model (AlphaBERT), respectively. The ROUGE-L scores were 0.697, 0.711, 0.648, and 0.693 for BERT, BioBERT, LSTM, and AlphaBERT, respectively. The mean (SD) critique scores from doctors were 2.232 (0.832), 2.134 (0.877), 2.207 (0.844), 1.927 (0.910), and 2.126 (0.874) for reference-by-doctor labels, BERT, BioBERT, LSTM, and AlphaBERT, respectively. Based on the paired t test, there was a statistically significant difference in LSTM compared to the reference (P&lt;.001), BERT (P=.001), BioBERT (P&lt;.001), and AlphaBERT (P=.002), but not in the other models. Conclusions Use of character-level tokens in a BERT model can greatly decrease the model size without significantly reducing performance for diagnoses summarization. A well-developed deep-learning model will enhance doctors’ abilities to manage patients and promote medical studies by providing the capability to use extensive unstructured free-text notes.",
