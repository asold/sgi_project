INTRODUCTION\nThe vegetable oil transformer is a kind of environment-\nfriendly insulating medium [1]–[3], which has the advan-\ntages of wide range raw materials, high ignition point and\nrenewable sources. However, the large-scale application of\nvegetable oil transformer has been hindered by problems such\nas fault detection and operation stability. When there is a fault\ninside the running transformer, such as overheating, partial\ndischarge, etc., due to thermal decomposition and arcing,\na variety of gases would be generated. The gases produced\nby different faults are different and these gases are dissolved\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Gongbo Zhou.\nin the transformer oil. Therefore, the internal insulation of the\ntransformer or the fault condition can be judged by measuring\nthe type and content of the gas dissolved in the transformer\noil. Currently, the dissolved gas analysis (DGA) technology\nhas been maturely applied in the fault diagnosis of mineral oil\ntransformer [4], [5]. However, the future practical application\nof vegetable oil transformer still faces a lack of fault data and\ndiagnosis methods correspondingly. Therefore, it is necessary\nto establish a DGA diagnosis method in order to realize\nthe large-scale promotion and application of vegetable oil\ntransformer.\nCurrently, experts and scholars have done a lot of\nresearches on gas production characteristics under different\nfaults in vegetable oil.

Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nresearches on the low-temperature overheating fault of veg-\netable oil transformer [6], ﬁnding that a large number of C 2H6\nwould be generated in vegetable oil, while H 2 and CH 4 are\ngenerated the most in mineral oil under the same fault con-\ndition. Compared with mineral oil, there is not much content\nof CH 4 and C 2H4 in vegetable oil during high temperature\nthermal faults. In contrast, the vegetable oil produces a large\namount of C 2H6 under the same overheating faults, while\nthe mineral oil does not produce. Scholars in Manchester\nUniversity, Chongqing University and other universities have\ncarried out experimental studies on high temperature thermal\nfaults in vegetable oils [7]–[9]. Manchester University have\nalso carried out 700 ◦C local high temperature thermal exper-\niments [8]. In addition, the thermal fault characteristics of\ndifferent vegetable oils are also different. The characteristic\ngases of FR3 and camellia oil under low-temperature thermal\nfault are H 2 and C 2H6 [10]. When partial discharge fault\noccurs in vegetable oil, the fault characteristic gas dissolved\nin vegetable insulating oil is mainly H 2 [11], followed by\nC2H6. For arc discharge or breakdown faults, the reduction\nof total gas production will make it more difﬁcult to identify\nearly faults in practical applications, unless the sensitivity\nof the analysis process can be improved [9]. On the whole,\nthe above fault experiments for the fault characteristics were\ncarried out under the ideal conditions of pure thermal faults\nor pure electrical faults. However, the internal operation envi-\nronment of actual transformer is very complex, the electrical\nfaults and thermal faults often occur simultaneously. There-\nfore more experiments of combined electro-thermal faults\nneed to be carried out.\nThe traditional diagnosis methods of fault characteristic\ngas in vegetable oil transformer include characteristic gas\nmethod, Duval diagram method and ratio method. The char-\nacteristic gas method can only roughly judge whether there\nexists early faults in the oil-ﬁlled transformer [12]. Further\nmore, Professor Zhongdong Wang found that due to the\ndifferent characteristics of fault gas production between the\nmineral oil and the vegetable oil, when using the characteris-\ntic gas method for fault diagnosis, the proportion of fault gas\nshould be changed to the proportion range to make the result\nmore accurately. As is known to all, the vegetable oil has\nhigher viscosity than the mineral oil, which will also affect\nthe fault diagnosis [13]. In [14], the thermal fault simulation\nexperiment of vegetable oil was carried out, and the IEC\nratio method and Duval triangle method were used to analyze\nthe results. However, it was proposed that IEC ratio method\ncould not be directly used to diagnose the thermal fault of\nvegetable oil. Although the ratios of characteristic gas corre-\nsponding to thermal faults were still distributed in the original\nthermal fault area, the result of the low temperature fault\nwas distributed in the middle temperature diagnosis range,\nresulting in the wrong diagnosis result [15], [16]. Moreover,\ndifferent kinds of vegetable oils need to formulate different\nfault characteristic gas rules [17]. The various vegetable oils\nare composed of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids such as\nstearic acid and palmitic acid. The composition of fatty acids\nin RAPO is different from other vegetable oils, giving them\nspecial physical and chemical properties. Therefore, under\nfault conditions, the characteristic gas produced by RAPO\nwould be different from other vegetable oils. Since the char-\nacteristic gas method cannot reﬂect the relationship between\nthe fault gas concentration, fault type and fault condition,\nfurther judgment cannot be made when the combined electro-\nthermal fault overlaps with the single fault characteristic gas.\nThe thermal, partial discharge and arc faults of vegetable\noils were simulated respectively by N. A. Muhamad and\nthe results were analyzed by DGA. Then the comparative\nexperiments between vegetable oils and mineral oils with\ndifferent moisture contents were carried out. The research on\nfault types was more detailed [18], [19], but mainly focused\non FR3 vegetable oil. Only Duval diagram method can diag-\nnose the internal faults of vegetable oil transformers such\nas FR3 and rapeseed oil. Even so, this method is limited to\npure faults and it cannot diagnose the electro-thermal faults.\nMoreover, there are many kinds of vegetable oils, and the\ndifferent components of vegetable oils will have a greater\nimpact on fault gas production. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to\nform a general standard for fault diagnosis of different kinds\nof vegetable oils, which needs to be differentiated according\nto the oil type. The ratio method of vegetable oil has not been\nproposed yet, and the existing coding combination does not\ninvolve the combined electro-thermal failure.\nIn this paper, an experiment platform of electro-thermal\nfaults in vegetable oil transformer was built. The gas gener-\nation characteristics of RAPO type vegetable oil under pure\nelectrical faults, pure thermal faults and combined electric-\nthermal faults were obtained. On the basis of ratio method, the\nelectric-thermal fault diagnosis method of RAPO vegetable\noil transformer was proposed by combining the characteristic\ngas and the ratio method.\nII. ELECTRO-THERMAL FAULT EXPERIMENT PLATFORM\nOF VEGETABLE OIL TRANSFORMER\nThe internal faults of oil-ﬁlled transformers are mainly clas-\nsiﬁed into three types: the thermal faults, the electrical faults\nand the combined electro-thermal faults. In practice, the ther-\nmal faults and the electrical faults often occur simultaneously\nin the power transformers. The purpose in this paper is to sim-\nulate the electrical fault, thermal fault and combined electro-\nthermal fault of vegetable oil transformer. The experimental\nconditions are as close as possible to the actual operation\nand internal environment in the transformer. Therefore, it is\nrequired that the electro-thermal fault simulation platform\nmust be able to simultaneously control the voltage and the\ntemperature. Due to the existence of self-circulation and\nforced circulation in the power transformer, the oil samples\nin the experimental platform also need to be forced to circu-\nlate. Considering the tightness and safety of the experimental\ndevice, also the accuracy of experimental data and observ-\nability of the experimental phenomena, the platform needs\nto meet the requirements of large capacity, leakproofness,\nruggedness and transparency. Therefore the electro-thermal\n101148 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH. Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nFIGURE 1. The experimental platform diagram.\nfault experiment platform of the vegetable oil transformer\nis designed to compose of three parts: the main oil tank,\nthe voltage and temperature control system, and the circu-\nlating pressure relieving system. The experimental platform\ndiagram is shown in Figure 1.\nThe main oil tank is made of quartz glass, which has\ngood resistance to high temperature and high pressure. The\nvolume of the main oil tank is 8 L and its design is shown\nin Figure 1(a). The electrode is connected to the high-voltage\nwire through the pipe in the middle. The high-voltage wire is\nconnected with high voltage resistant insulator to ensure the\nsafety of high voltage experiment. The size of the electrode\nmodel conforms to the IEC 60243 standard. The diameter\nof the copper ball is 40 mm and the diameter of the plate\nelectrode is 75 mm. In the middle and lower part of the\nmain oil tank, there are two channels for installing short-wave\ninfrared heating lamp, which can reach up to 1200 ◦C with\nlarge temperature controllable range. The temperature sen-\nsors are installed on the infrared short-wave heating lamps at\nthe upper, middle and lower parts of the main oil tank respec-\ntively. The overall and partial temperature of vegetable oil in\nthe main oil tank can be adjusted in real time. The circulating\npressure relieving system consists of a high temperature cir-\nculating pump, a circulating pipe, an oil injection pipeline,\nand a pressure relief valve. The ﬂow rate of high temperature\ncirculating pump can be displayed and controlled by the\ntemperature and velocity control cabinet. The oil circulation\ndriven by the pump can accelerate the gas dissolution and\nmake the gas distribution in oil more uniform.\nThe insulation structure inside the power transformer is\noil-paper composite insulation. As the transformer oil and\nthe insulating paper have different fault products in the oper-\nation of the power transformer, thus the products of the\noil-paper composite structure is more complicated. There-\nfore, the single variable method was adopted to study on\nthe fault characteristics of transformer oil, regardless of the\nproducts and effects of the insulation paper. In the future,\nthe fault simulation experiment of paper and oil-paper com-\nposite insulation will be carried out. The electro-thermal fault\nexperiment process mainly contain three steps: the oil pre-\ntreatment, the electro-thermal fault experiment and the dis-\nsolved gas analysis. The oil pretreatment procedures include\nmeasurement of initial water content, removal of bubbles and\nnormal operation simulation. The pretreated oil sample was\nstill standing for two hours and then for one hour of normal\noperation at 80 ◦C and voltage without partial discharge.\nThe initial water content in the oil provided by the manu-\nfacturer is 50 mg/L, which indicated that the oil used in the\nexperiment is in good condition. After one hour of normal\noperation of transformer, the pretreated oil sample was used\nto simulate the electric-thermal fault by altering the voltage\nand temperature. The electro-thermal faults experiments were\ncarried out according to the standard of IEC 60076-1 [20],\nIEC 60076-5 [21] and ASTM D3305 [22]. There may be\nthe errors and uncertainties in the experiments, therefore the\namount of experimental data should be as big as possible.\nDuring the experiment three samples were taken at a time,\nand the average value was taken as the ﬁnal result. If there\nwere abnormal data, repetitive experiments were carried out.\nEach fault simulation was basically repeated three times to\nensure that the experimental data are sufﬁcient and reliable.\nThe simulation experiments of partial discharge and low-\nenergy discharge combined with overall slight overheating,\nlocal medium and high temperature thermal faults were sam-\npled every 10 minutes. The overheating thermal fault temper-\natures are set at 120 ◦C, 200 ◦C and 500 ◦C respectively. In the\nexperiment of partial discharge combined with low energy\ndischarge at 700 ◦C, the oil samples were sampled every\n5 minutes. The high-energy discharge faults were simulated\nby raising to the breakdown voltage gradually. In the simu-\nlation experiment of high-energy discharge faults at 120 ◦C,\n200 ◦C and 500 ◦C, two breakdown faults were carried out\nevery 8 minutes, which were completed within 1 minute, and\nthen the gas was circulated for 1 minute to ensure the uniform\nmixing before sampling. Two tubes of oil samples were taken\nat a time. The corresponding fault temperature and circulating\nvelocity remain unchanged for 8 minutes without breakdown\ndischarge operation. Considering safety, the breakdown of\nVOLUME 7, 2019 101149\nH. Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nTABLE 1. Temperature and voltage of electro-thermal faults.\nhigh-energy discharge faults occurred twice every 3 minutes\nat 700 ◦C from the beginning of the simulation experiment.\nThe breakdown was completed within 1 minute, and the gas\nmixing is ensured by 1 minute circulating before sampling.\nDue to the high temperature and high brightness of short-\nwave infrared heating lamp, the experimental phenomenon\nwas not easy to observe. It is necessary to monitor the tem-\nperature in real time to ensure that the simulated fault tem-\nperature does not exceed the target threshold. After sampling,\nthe Agilent GC 7890B gas chromatograph and its supporting\nsoftware was used for gas chromatographic analysis.\nIII. GAS PRODUCTION PRINCIPLES OF VEGETABLE\nOIL TRANSFORMER WITH ELECTRICAL\nAND THERMAL FAULTS\nA. GAS PRODUCTION PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICAL FAULTS\nUNDER NON-FAULT THERMAL STRESS\nThe gas chromatographic data statistics of electrical fault\nexperiments with non-fault thermal stress are shown\nin Figure 2. The horizontal axis is the fault experiment time\nin min, while the vertical axis is the fault gas content in ppm.\nThe point with the horizontal axis of 0 min corresponds\nto the gas content in the oil after the normal operation of\nthe transformer at 80 ◦C and 4.4 kV for 1 hour. This point\nFIGURE 2. Gas generation of different electrical faults under non-fault\nthermal stress.\nserves as the starting point of fault gas generation. It can be\nseen from the ﬁgure that under different kinds of electrical\nfaults, the production of characteristic gas increased with\ntime. Further more, the production of non-hydrocarbon gases\nsuch as carbon dioxide, hydrogen and carbon monoxide was\nmuch larger than that of hydrocarbon gases such as methane,\nethane, acetylene and ethylene under different electrical fault\nconditions. When different electrical faults occurred under\nnon-fault thermal stress, the production of carbon dioxide was\nlarger than that of other gases. The production of carbon diox-\nide increased rapidly in the early stage with the development\nof electrical faults, and tended to be stable in the later stage.\nThe RAPO vegetable oil contains a large number of carbon\nand oxygen atoms, and is easy to decompose and produce\nmuch CO and CO 2 under the fault energy. As is known\nthat carbon dioxide has the greatest solubility in RAPO,\nthe carbon dioxide produced by decomposition of ester group\nunder those fault conditions will be dissolved in oil in large\nquantities. Compared with mineral oil, the main components\nof mineral oil are alkanes and naphthenes. The carbon dioxide\nand the carbon monoxide are not easy to be produced by\ndecomposed oil except for the decomposition of insulation\npaper. Therefore, in the analysis of characteristic gas and gas\nproduction rules of RAPO vegetable oil, the content of carbon\ndioxide or carbon monoxide alone could not be regarded as\nthe key factor to diagnose the fault. The characteristics of\nhydrocarbon gas production under different electrical faults\n101150 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH. Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nare quite different, so the hydrocarbon gas can be used to\nbetter distinguish the electrical faults. The total hydrocarbon\ncontent of spark discharge fault and breakdown discharge\nfault is larger than that of partial discharge faults, as the\nvegetable oil molecules are more easily to be destroyed and\ndecomposed into small molecules under high energy. Due to\nthe low energy of partial discharge, the promotion of molecu-\nlar cracking in oil is much less than that of spark discharge or\nbreakdown discharge. The fault energy of spark discharge is\nclose to that of breakdown discharge, but the stable existence\ntime is much longer than that of breakdown discharge. There-\nfore, the hydrocarbon gas production of breakdown discharge\nwas slightly smaller than that of spark discharge.\nDuring the partial discharge faults under non-fault ther-\nmal stress, the methane gas production increases obviously,\nindicating that the methane generation is very sensitive to\npartial discharge. The gas production of ethane, acetylene and\nethylene is less than 1 ppm with no obvious rising or falling\ntrend. The overall trend of the three non-hydrocarbon gases\nis upward. Excluding the carbon dioxide gas with high solu-\nbility, the gas production of carbon monoxide and hydrogen\nis less than 200 ppm, and the gas production trend is similar.\nTherefore, methane can be used as the main characteristic gas\nof partial discharge faults under non-fault thermal stress of\nRAPO vegetable oil transformer, and ethane and ethylene are\nthe secondary components of the characteristic gas.\nIn the experiment of spark discharge fault under non-\nfault thermal stress, the gas production of acetylene is the\nlargest, followed by ethylene and methane. There is almost no\nethane produced. As the high-energy and high-temperature\nfault characteristic gas under single fault, the production of\nacetylene needs the most energy because of its high molecular\nbond energy [11]. The reason for the increase of acetylene\ngas production in the initial stage may be the combination of\nthermal stress and spark discharge. The decrease of acetylene\ngas production in the later stage is still lower than that of\nhigh energy breakdown discharge, which is insufﬁcient to\nmaintain the continuous generation of acetylene. Although\nthe oil temperature is controlled at 80 ◦C, the actual envi-\nronment is not an absolutely constant temperature. Therefore\nthe increase of temperature around spark discharge may lead\nto the decrease of acetylene solubility in oil and the escape\nof acetylene. The production trends of carbon monoxide are\nsimilar to those under the partial discharge and breakdown\ndischarge. In addition, the production of hydrogen increases\nsigniﬁcantly, which is much higher than that under partial\ndischarge and breakdown discharge. Because of its unique\nproduction regulation, the acetylene can still be used as the\nmain characteristic gas of spark discharge fault under the nor-\nmal working thermal stress of RAPO vegetable oil. Hydrogen\nand ethylene can be used as the secondary characteristic gas.\nIn the experiment of breakdown discharge under non-fault\nthermal stress, the gas production of hydrocarbon fault gases\nexcept acetylene is methane > ethane > ethylene. How-\never, it is worth noting that the gas production of ethane\nunder breakdown fault is obviously higher than that of partial\ndischarge or spark discharge. Therefore, ethane is the char-\nacteristic gas to distinguish spark discharge fault from break-\ndown discharge fault under non-fault thermal stress. The gas\nproduction of acetylene under this fault condition is basically\nthe same as that under the same discharge at normal tem-\nperature. The carbon dioxide production under breakdown\ndischarge fault is more than that under partial discharge and\nspark discharge, while the production trend of hydrogen and\ncarbon monoxide are still similar. Therefore, acetylene can be\nstill used as the characteristic gas of breakdown and discharge\nfault of RAPO oil under non-fault thermal stress. Ethane can\nalso be used as the main characteristic gas to distinguish\npartial discharge and spark discharge. Methane and carbon\nmonoxide can be used as the secondary characteristic gas.\nIt can be concluded that methane and acetylene can be used\nas the characteristic gas of electrical fault under non-fault\nthermal stress. The gas production trend of carbon dioxide,\ncarbon monoxide and hydrogen have no particularity in the\nexperiment under different electrical fault, indicating that it\ncannot be used as the fault characteristic gas alone. Therefore,\nit is necessary to introduce a new fault criteria to distinguish\nthe different electrical faults under non-fault thermal stress.\nB. GAS PRODUCTION PRINCIPLES OF THERMAL FAULTS\nUNDER NON-FAULT ELECTRICAL STRESS\nThe thermal fault experiment under non-fault electrical stress\nis to simulate the thermal fault under normal electrical opera-\ntion conditions. The electrical stress is applied at the voltage\nup close to partial discharge voltage, while under which the\npartial discharge would not occur. The thermal faults are\nsimulated under mild thermal fault (120 ◦C), low temper-\nature thermal fault (200 ◦C), medium temperature thermal\nfault (500 ◦C) and high temperature thermal fault (700 ◦C).\nAccording to the internal temperature speciﬁcation of trans-\nformer operation, except mild overheating fault at 120 ◦C,\nthe simulated thermal fault in this paper is partial fault. The\ngas chromatographic data statistics of thermal fault experi-\nments under non-fault electrical stress are shown in Figure 3.\nThe horizontal axis is the fault experiment time in min, while\nthe vertical axis is the fault gas content in ppm.\nAs can be seen from the ﬁgure, in the mild thermal fault\n(120 ◦C) under non-fault electrical stress, the overall trend\nof gas production is relatively special. There are two rea-\nsons for this trend. Firstly, the production of hydrogen and\nethane increases sharply at the beginning of the fault, which\nconforms to the gas production regulation of vegetable oil\nfault under a single slight thermal fault. The electric stress\nhas little effect on this condition. Secondly, the condition\nof slightly overheating fault with non-fault electrical stress\nis very close to the critical condition of thermal fault under\nnormal operation. The energy of electric-thermal fault is less,\nmaking the decomposition of vegetable oil molecules slowly.\nIt takes longer to produce fault gas, so the gas production\ntends to increase in the later period.\nIn the experiment of low temperature thermal fault\n(200 ◦C) under non-fault electrical stress, the production of\nVOLUME 7, 2019 101151\nH. Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nFIGURE 3. Gas production trend of thermal faults at different\ntemperatures under non-fault electrical stress.\nseven fault gases also increase with time. The content of ethy-\nlene, methane and acetylene is very small, which cannot be\nused as the characteristic gas of this fault. The gas production\nof ethane are almost the same as that of methane in the early\nstage. However, the former increases sharply in the later stage\nand reach a high concentration. The carbon dioxide increased\nsharply when the experiment lasted for 10 minutes, reaching\nsaturated solubility within this temperature range. The trend\nof carbon monoxide and hydrogen production is very close,\nso the three kinds of non-hydrocarbon gases cannot be used\nas fault characteristic gases alone. New criteria need to be\nintroduced for fault diagnosis. Ethane can be used the main\ncharacteristic gas of partial low temperature thermal fault at\n200 ◦C under non-fault electrical stress.\nIn the simulation of medium temperature thermal fault\n(500 ◦C) under non-fault electrical stress, almost no ethylene\nand methane are produced. In the last ten minutes of the\nexperiment, although methane production shows an increas-\ning trend, it was still too small to be a gas characteristic of\nthis fault. However, the concentration of ethane is close to\n200 ppm, showing an obvious fault characteristic. The carbon\ndioxide reaches its saturation solubility in ten minutes of the\nearly stage. The gas production trend of hydrogen and carbon\nmonoxide is similar, but in the later stage of experiment,\nthe production rate of carbon monoxide increases sharply.\nThe growth rate of hydrogen production tends to be stable,\nand the concentration of hydrogen is much lower than that of\ncarbon monoxide. Therefore, in terms of gas concentration,\nethane and hydrogen can be used as the fault characteristic\ngases under the condition of medium temperature thermal\nfault at 500 ◦C. The direct and special relative relationship\nbetween hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used to dis-\ntinguish the fault from others.\nIn the experiment of high temperature thermal fault\n(700 ◦C) under non-fault electrical stress, the temperature\nof non-fault point rises rapidly due to the excessive partial\ntemperature. There is no ethylene and acetylene production\nand small methane production, which cannot be used to\nidentify the fault characteristics. However, the gas production\nof ethane increases rapidly at the early stage and sharply\nat the later stage. The time of ethane reaching a surge at\n700 ◦C is 20 min and 30 min earlier than that at 500 ◦C\nand 200 ◦C. It shows that the higher the temperature is, the\nfaster the cracking rate of vegetable oil molecules is. The gas\nproduction of carbon dioxide is similar to that of 500 ◦C and\n200 ◦C. In addition, the gas production trend of hydrogen and\ncarbon monoxide are almost the same, which is different from\nthat of 500 ◦C and 200 ◦C. Accordingly, ethane can be used\nas the fault characteristic gas of high temperature thermal\nfault (700 ◦C) under non-fault electrical stress, and new fault\ncriteria need to be introduced to distinguish this fault from\nothers.\nAs can be concluded from the above, when the thermal\nfaults occur under non-fault electrical stress, the gas produc-\ntion of ethane is obviously larger than that of other hydrocar-\nbon gases, which is the characteristic gas of thermal faults at\nall temperatures. Ethane is produced very little under the con-\ndition of different energy electrical faults with non-fault ther-\nmal stress. Therefore ethane can be used as the characteristic\ngas to distinguish thermal faults from electrical faults. The\nspecial gas production trend of methane and hydrogen can be\nused as a distinguishing feature between faults at 120 ◦C and\nother temperatures under non-fault electrical stress. Under\nthermal faults at 200 ◦C, 500 ◦C and 700 ◦C with non-fault\nelectric stress, the gas production trend of ethane increases\nsteadily at ﬁrst, and then sharply at later stage. The breakpoint\nis advanced with the increase of temperature. Carbon dioxide\ncannot be used as a characteristic gas of thermal fault as the\ncontent in oil reaches saturated solubility in the early stage\nof fault.\nC. GAS PRODUCTION PRINCIPLES OF COMBINED\nELECTRIC-THERMAL FAULTS\nIn most of the practical conditions, the faults mainly occur\nin the combined electro-thermal conditions. When the fault\ndevelops to a certain extent, the electrical and thermal faults\noften promote each other. In order to get the experimental data\n101152 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH. Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nFIGURE 4. Gas production of combined electro-thermal faults.\nclose to the actual operating conditions, the experiments of\ncombined electro-thermal fault were carried out. The partial\ndischarge fault, low-energy discharge fault and high-energy\ndischarge fault are simulated under the temperatures at\n120 ◦C, 200 ◦C, 500 ◦C and 700 ◦C, as shown in Figure 4.\nThe horizontal axis is the fault simulation time in min, while\nVOLUME 7, 2019 101153\nH. Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nthe vertical axis is the fault gas content in ppm. The point with\nthe horizontal axis of 0 min corresponds to the gas content in\nthe oil after the normal operation of the transformer at 80 ◦C\nand 4.4 kV for 1 hour. This point serves as the starting point\nof fault gas generation.\nIn the experiment of partial discharge fault and spark dis-\ncharge fault, the trend of hydrocarbon gas production is sim-\nilar. The gas production of ethane is the largest, and its trend\nis very close to that of slight overall thermal fault at 120 ◦C\nunder non-fault electrical stress. It can be concluded that the\ndischarge energy of normal operation, partial discharge and\nspark discharge have no obvious inﬂuence on the genera-\ntion of fault gas under the slight thermal fault conditions.\nTemperature is the main factor inﬂuencing the faults under\nthose three conditions. Therefore, the slight overheating fault\ncan be distinguished from other thermal faults through the\nspecial gas production trend of ethane, and new fault criteria\nare needed to distinguish whether there is an electrical fault.\nThe content of carbon dioxide reaches saturated solubility at\n10 minutes, which has no reference value for fault diagno-\nsis. Partial discharge and spark discharge faults at 120 ◦C\nunder overall thermal fault can be distinguished by gas pro-\nduction trend and gas production rate of carbon monoxide\nand hydrogen. Acetylene, as the characteristic gas of single\nhigh-energy discharge fault, is also the characteristic gas of\nbreakdown discharge fault under slight overheating fault at\n120 ◦C. It shows that the energy of breakdown discharge is\nhigher than that of the whole slight overheating fault and has\ngreater impact on oil, so the fault gas generation is closer\nto the characteristics of electrical fault. The gas production\nof ethane can be neglected under the single electrical fault\nbut jump under the combined fault of slight overheating and\nbreakdown discharge, which also reﬂects the inﬂuence of\noverheating fault on vegetable oil. Ignoring carbon dioxide\nwhich cannot be used as a characterization, new criteria need\nto be introduced to further quantitatively reﬂect the charac-\nteristics of the relationship between production of hydrogen\nand carbon monoxide.\nDue to the low energy of partial discharge and spark\ndischarge, the characteristic gas under electrical fault is not\nobvious, and the ethane production under thermal fault is\nthe largest. The energy of spark discharge is larger than\nthat of partial discharge, which reﬂects that the ethane gas\nproduction under partial discharge is larger than that under\npartial discharge. It is worth noting that under partial dis-\ncharge fault, the gas production trend of acetylene is similar\nto that of ethane, and the gas production rate is only slightly\nless to that of ethane. Acetylene, as the characteristic gas of\nhigh-energy discharge fault, needs enormous energy to be\nproduced. When the temperature of partial overheating spot\nin transformer reaches 200 ◦C, it will heat the non-fault area,\nand the insulation performance of vegetable oil would be\ndamaged. If the partial discharge occurs at the same time,\nthe two faults will affect each other, which will further deteri-\norate and decompose the vegetable oil. Therefore, acetylene\ncan be used as a fault characteristic gas to distinguish partial\ndischarge from spark discharge under the condition of partial\nlow temperature thermal fault at 200 ◦C. Acetylene, as the\ncharacteristic gas of single high-energy discharge fault, has\nthe largest gas production and rate under breakdown fault,\nfollowed by ethane, which is the characteristic gas of single\noverheating fault. Therefore, it is impossible to distinguish\nthe three kinds of electrical faults at 200 ◦C only by hydrocar-\nbon fault characteristic gas. A new characteristic quantity of\nnon-hydrocarbon gas is needed to be introduced for analysis.\nThe gas production trend and production rate of ethane\nare higher than other gases under partial discharge, spark\ndischarge and breakdown discharge combined with local\nmedium thermal fault at 500 ◦C. The gas production of partial\ndischarge is different from other two kinds of discharges,\nand a large number of hydrocarbon fault characteristic gases\nare generated at the beginning of the experiment. The main\ncharacteristic gas is ethane, and the secondary characteristic\ngas is acetylene. The gas production regulation under spark\ndischarge and breakdown discharge are very similar, and the\nmain characteristic gases are ethane. However, the secondary\ncharacteristic gases are different, showing methane under\nthe spark discharge while acetylene under the breakdown\ndischarge. The trend of non-hydrocarbon fault characteristic\ngases produced by three kinds of different energy electrical\nfaults under local medium temperature thermal fault at 500 ◦C\nis similar, and the gas production is slightly different, so it is\ndifﬁcult to distinguish the faults.\nIn the experiment of partial discharge and spark discharge\nfaults under high temperature thermal faults at 700 ◦C, the\ncharacteristic gas production trends of hydrocarbons and non-\nhydrocarbons are very close. Among the four kinds of hydro-\ncarbon fault gases, the production of ethane is the largest, and\nincrease sharply during the fault process. Ethane can be used\nas the main characteristic gas of partial discharge and spark\ndischarge under the local high temperature thermal fault at\n700 ◦C, while methane is the secondary characteristic gas.\nIn the process of breakdown discharge, the gas production\nof acetylene increases sharply, which is larger than that under\nbreakdown conditions at other temperature. Therefore, acety-\nlene can be used as the characteristic gas to distinguish the\nbreakdown fault under the partial high temperature thermal\nfaults at 700 ◦C from other electro-thermal faults. In the\nprocess of this electro-thermal faults, the carbon dioxide\ngas production basically keeps near the saturated solubility,\nso it is impossible to be used as a characteristic gas under\nthose faults. The trend of hydrogen and carbon monoxide\nproduction is similar, but the rate is different. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to introduce criteria that can react with the rate\nof hydrogen and carbon monoxide to distinguish faults more\naccurately.\nD. GAS PRODUCTION PRINCIPLE SUMMARY OF\nVEGETABLE OIL UNDER ELECTRICAL\nAND THERMAL FAULTS\nIt can be seen that methane and acetylene are characteristic\ngases of electrical fault under thermal stress while ethane\n101154 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH. Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nis the characteristic gas of thermal fault under electrical\nstress. Characteristic gases and gas production rate of electro-\nthermal faults vary with the energy of electrical and thermal\nfaults. Acetylene is the fault characteristic gas under single\nhigh temperature thermal fault or single high energy electrical\nfault, and its generation needs enormous energy. This feature\nis also reﬂected in electro-thermal faults. When breakdown\nfaults occur at different temperatures, a large amount of\nacetylene will be produced because of the high fault energy\nof breakdown discharge. The higher the fault temperature,\nthe higher the acetylene content under the same electrical\nfault. Acetylene, produced by high-energy discharge fault,\noccupies a dominant position in the fault gas under the\nelectro-thermal faults at 120 ◦C and 200 ◦C mainly due\nto the low temperature of thermal fault. Ethane, produced\nby high temperature thermal fault occupies the dominant\nposition in the fault gas under the electro-thermal faults at\n500 ◦C and 700 ◦C due to the high temperature of thermal\nfault. At the same time, high-energy discharge still promotes\nthe production of acetylene in large quantities. Ethylene and\nacetylene are characteristic gases of these faults. In addition\nto the breakdown faults under the condition of overall and\npartial thermal faults at 120 ◦C and 200 ◦C, the gas pro-\nduction of ethane in other electro-thermal faults occupies\nan absolute advantage in all hydrocarbon gases, indicating\nthat thermal faults are the main factors affecting the cracking\nof vegetable oils. The trend of partial discharge and spark\ndischarge under the overall slight overheating fault at 120 ◦C\nis special, but it is consistent with the gas production trend\nof the overall slight overheating fault at 120 ◦C under the\nnon-fault electrical stress. Under the condition of electro-\nthermal faults, especially when the energy of electrical faults\nis low, the gas generation trend of the electro-thermal fault\nshows similarity with the characteristics of slight overheating\nfaults.\nThe types of non-hydrocarbon gases produced under ther-\nmal fault with electrical stress, electrical fault with thermal\nstress and electro-thermal faults are the same as under single\nfault, and the characteristic gases are carbon dioxide, carbon\nmonoxide and hydrogen. According to the gas solubility table\nof RAPO vegetable oil at different temperatures, the car-\nbon dioxide produced by almost all faults in this simulation\nexperiment reaches saturated solubility and remains stable\nduring the process of faults. So carbon dioxide is difﬁcult to\nbe used as a fault characteristic gas. Under the same fault,\nthe relative gas trend and gas production of hydrogen and\ncarbon monoxide are almost the same, with a sudden increase\nof those gas occasionally. Under different faults, there is little\ndifference between hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Only\nthe breakdown discharges at 700 ◦C make the production of\nhydrogen and carbon monoxide much larger than other faults.\nTherefore, it is difﬁcult and complex to distinguish faults\nby describing the intuitive characteristics of hydrogen and\ncarbon monoxide. Therefore, a new fault diagnosis variable\nshould be introduced to distinguish the thermal faults of\ndifferent temperatures under the same discharge energy range\nand the electrical faults of different energy under the same\ntemperature range.\nIt can be seen from the characteristic gas of electro-\nthermal faults in RAPO vegetable oil transformer that the\nmain and secondary fault characteristic gases are different\nunder different electro-thermal faults. However, due to the\nsmall difference between different electrical faults and ther-\nmal faults, the types of fault characteristic gases are similar.\nThe general types of faults can be basically distinguished by\nqualitative distinction. The thermal faults and electrical faults\ncan be distinguished by methane and ethane, while the high-\nenergy and low-energy discharge faults can be distinguished\nby acetylene. In order to distinguish the thermal faults at dif-\nferent temperatures, electrical faults at different energies and\ndifferent combined electro-thermal faults in RAPO vegetable\noil transformers more carefully, it is impossible to draw an\naccurate conclusion only by the type of fault characteristic\ngas in oil. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the fault char-\nacteristic gas method with other fault diagnosis methods to\nimprove the accuracy of fault diagnosis and further to estab-\nlish an internal fault diagnosis method of RAPO vegetable oil\ntransformers.\nIV. FAULT DIAGNOSIS METHOD OF VEGETABLE OIL\nTRANSFORMER BASED ON CHARACTERISTIC GAS AND\nRATIO CRITERION\nDue to the similarity of characteristic gases under electrical\nfaults, thermal faults and combined electro-thermal faults of\nthe RAPO vegetable oil transformer, it is difﬁcult only to\nuse the characteristic gas method to distinguish the different\nfaults. In addition, as the fault gases of RAPO, Biotemp,\nFR3 and mineral oil is different, the existing fault diagno-\nsis methods would cause mistakes when applied to RAPO\noil. For instance, when partial discharge occurred combined\nwith local medium thermal faults, the ratios of CH 4/H2 and\nC2H4/C2H6 are almost zero. The ratio of C 2H2/C2H4 will be\nimpossible to handle, which indicates that the existing ratio\nmethod is not applicable to RAPO oil. Also as described in\nthe introduction section, the existing Duval diagram method\ncannot diagnose the combined electro-thermal fault, so new\nfault diagnosis method need to be developed to distinguish\ndifferent faults accurately. The content of carbon dioxide\nalways reaches saturated solubility quickly in the process\nof the fault, so it is meaningless to use it to distinguish\nfaults. The relative ratio Ki of carbon monoxide and hydrogen\ngas production at different fault times is introduced as a\nnew criterion which can reﬂect the relative gas production,\ngas production trend and relative gas rate of the two gases\nunder different electro-thermal faults. By combining the\nmethod of fault characteristic gas and characteristic gas ratio,\nthe fault diagnosis method based on the new criterion Ki is\nproposed\nKi =m(CO)\nm(H2)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 101155\nH. Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nFIGURE 5. Flow chart of fault diagnosis method for RAPO vegetable oil transformer.\nin which, m(CO) is the gas production of carbon monoxide in\nunit of ppm, m(H2) is the gas production of hydrogen in unit\nof ppm, and i is the sampling time in unit of min.\nFirstly, the content of various hydrocarbon gas is com-\npared, and the Ki value is calculated by using the ratio of\ncarbon monoxide to hydrogen production. If the content of\nacetylene is the largest and the Ki value ﬂuctuates around 1,\nit can be diagnosed as a combined high-energy breakdown\nand partial low temperature thermal fault. If the Ki increases\nmonotonously and the value is greater than 2.5, the spark\ndischarge with non-fault thermal stress can be diagnosed.\nIf the initial value of Ki increases monotonously and less\nthan 1, and the ﬁnal value is greater than 1, the high energy\nbreakdown and overall slight overheating combined fault can\nbe diagnosed. If the gas production of ethane is the largest and\nthe gas production of ethylene is larger than that of methane,\n101156 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH. Conget al.: Electro-Thermal Fault Diagnosis Method of RAPO Vegetable Oil Transformer\nand Ki ﬂuctuates around 1, the combined high-energy break-\ndown discharge and medium temperature thermal fault can\nbe diagnosed. If the Ki monotonously increases, it can be\ndiagnosed as the combined partial discharge and medium\ntemperature thermal fault. If Ki monotonously decreases and\nthe concentration of hydrogen is more than 3000 ppm, it can\nbe diagnosed as the combined partial discharge and high\ntemperature thermal fault. If the concentration of hydrogen\nis less than 3000 ppm, the combined partial discharge and\nlow temperature thermal fault can be diagnosed. When the\ngas production of ethane is the largest and the gas production\nof ethylene is larger than that of methane, also Ki ﬂuctuates\naround a value larger than 1, the high temperature partial\nthermal faults with no discharge fault or partial discharge or\nlow-potential spark discharge fault can be diagnosed. If Ki\nis larger than 1 and Ki monotonously increases, the medium\ntemperature thermal fault with non-fault electrical stress can\nbe diagnosed. If Ki is greater than 1 and does not increases\nmonotonously, also the gas production of ethane increases\nﬁrst and then decreases with the development of the fault,\nthen it can be judged as the combined low-energy spark\ndischarge and slight overheating fault. If the max value of\nKi is greater than 2 and the trend of Ki does not increases\nmonotonously, also the gas production of ethane does not\nshow the aforementioned trend, then it can be judged as\nthe low temperature thermal faults with non-fault electrical\nstress. If the max value of Ki is less than 2, it can be judged\nas the combined low-energy spark discharge and low temper-\nature thermal faults. According to the aforementioned fault\ndiagnosis process, the ﬂow chart of fault diagnosis method\non RAPO vegetable oil transformer is shown in Figure 5.\nThough this ﬂow chart can distinguish most of the electri-\ncal faults, thermal faults and combined electro-thermal faults,\nsome of them are still difﬁcult to distinguish due to similar gas\nproduction characteristics. For instance, the gas production\nand Ki trend of partial discharge, spark discharge occurred\nwith high temperature faults and the high temperature faults\nwith non-fault electrical stress are similar, then it is hard to\ndistinguish them. However, the combined breakdown dis-\ncharge and high temperature fault is different from them.\nIt can be concluded that temperature is the most serious factor\naffecting the combined electrical and high temperature fault.\nThe energy of partial discharge and spark discharge faults\nare covered by the energy of high temperature fault, so the\nfault characteristics of combined fault are closer to that of\nthe high temperature thermal fault. Therefore the electrical\nstress of partial discharge or spark discharge combined with\nhigh temperature faults can be classiﬁed as the single high\ntemperature thermal faults in practice. The high-energy dis-\ncharge fault and high-temperature fault both have great effect\non oil aging and deterioration. The high-temperature fault\nabove 700 ◦C may cause insulation damage and lead to insu-\nlation breakdown. The temperature of breakdown point can\nbe very high because of the excessive discharge energy. The\nfault characteristics of those two high-energy single faults\nare obvious and producing large gases, so the combined fault\nTABLE 2. Diagnostic accuracy of electro-thermal fault method.\ncharacteristics can be distinguished. However, the gas pro-\nduction regulation of combined breakdown discharge-high\ntemperature thermal fault and the combined partial discharge-\nlow temperature thermal fault are similar, which can only\nbe distinguished by gas production rate of hydrogen. Hydro-\ngen is also the characteristic gas of single high temperature\nthermal fault and single high energy electrical fault, so it is\nreasonable to distinguish the combined high temperature and\nhigh energy fault from the combined low temperature and\nlow energy fault by hydrogen. In addition, under other fault\nconditions, the fault characteristic gases of single electrical\nfault, single thermal fault and combined electro-thermal fault\ncan be distinguished by its own characteristics.\nIn order to verify the method of fault diagnosis, the exper-\niments of combined electro-thermal fault were carried out,\nand the diagnostic accuracy is shown in Table 2. It can be\nseen that the diagnostic accuracy of this method is over 85%\nfor all kinds of single and combined faults.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe large-scale popularization and application of vegetable\noil transformer still faces the problem of fault diagnosis\nmethod. On the basis of electro-thermal fault experiment\nand gas production data of RAPO vegetable oil, the gas\nproduction principles under electrical fault, thermal fault and\nelectro-thermal fault were obtained. Combined the traditional\ncharacteristic gas method with the ratio method, a new ratio\ncriterion was introduced. Then the electrical and thermal fault\ndiagnosis method on RAPO vegetable oil was established.\nA large number of experiments were performed for different\nfaults, and the experimental samples were built into the fault\nsignature database. According to the feature database, the\ncorresponding diagnosis method is proposed. Some sam-\nple data are randomly selected from the database to verify\nthe diagnostic method, so as to analyze its accuracy and\nfeasibility. Though the current experimental data are only\navailable in the laboratory and future applications depend\non transformers with different voltage levels and capacities\non site, the research can still provide some reference value\nfor transformer fault diagnosis in the future. The future ﬁeld\napplication of fault diagnosis method is similar to the exper-\niment, and the fault can be diagnosed by judging the gas\nproduction rate and growth trend of the dissolved gases. The\nabove gas production principles and fault diagnosis method\nof RAPO vegetable oil transformer can provide reference for\nthe development of high voltage and large capacity RAPO\nvegetable oil transformer.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 101157\nH.
