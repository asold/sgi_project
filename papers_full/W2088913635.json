Li\nSchool of Electronic Engineering\nBeijing University of Posts and Telecommunications\nBeijing, China\nAbstract—A compact Pi-structure transformer operating at arbitrary\ndual band is proposed in this paper. To achieve the ideal impedance\nmatching, the exact design formulas with no restrictions are obtained.\nIn addition, it is found that there are inﬁnite solutions for this novel\ntransformer considering the fact that three independent variables exist\nin two equations. Furthermore, to verify the design formulas, the\nreﬂection characteristics in diﬀerent cases are shown by numerical\nsimulations. The horizontal length of this transformer is half of the\nMonzon’s dual band transformer. The proposed dual band transformer\ncan be used in many compact dual band components such as antennas,\ncouplers and power dividers.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nWith the development of mobile communication, the utility ratio of\nthe frequency band has been improved dramatically. In many cases,\ndevices are required to work at two diﬀerent frequencies (namely dual\nband)[1-5]. Based on the principle of two-section transformers, Chow\net al. proposes a novel transformer of one-third wavelength in two\nsections for a frequency and its ﬁrst harmonic [6]. However, the\nperformance of the transformer designed by the inexact method in\n[6] is deteriorated by an elevating ratio between the input and load\nimpedance. And then, [7] and [8] represent comprehensive analysis and\nexact solutions of ﬂexible dual band transformer. Recently, this small\ndual band transformer has been applied in dual band power dividers\n[9–11] and unequal dual band power dividers [12, 13].\nIn this paper, we present a novel Pi-structure transformer\noperating at arbitrary dual band which is more compact than one\nin [8]. By solving the matching equations, it is found that there are\n122 Wu, Liu, and Li\ninﬁnite numbers of solutions for this novel transformer considering the\nfact that three independent variables exist in two equations. Since\ndiﬀerent matching parameters can be obtained from close-form design\nformulas in diﬀerent cases, this compact transformer can be designed\nconveniently and ﬂexibly in compact dual band components design.\nFor example, in the special case when characteristic impedances of the\nmatching stubs are equal, the proposed transformer has been used in\ndual band couplers [14] and power dividers [15], which have certiﬁed\nthis dual frequency Pi structure design concept simultaneously. In\naddition, it is necessary to point out that the eﬀects of circuit layouts\nare not considered in the analysis of transmission lines to obtain ﬁnal\nclosed-form design equations.\n2. DESIGN EQUATIONS\nThe Pi-structure dual band transformer is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nConsidering that the transmission lines are connected in parallel, the\nadmittances are applied to analyze the design equations.\n33,\n11,θZ\n22, LR\n0Z\nθZ θZ\nFigure 1.Circuit of Pi-structure dual\nband transformer.\n11,Y θ\n3Y2Y\nFigure 2. Equivalent circuit\nof Fig. 1.\nIn order to be analyzed conveniently, the circuit shown in Fig. 1\ncan be represented as an equivalent one shown in Fig. 2, whose\nadmittances can be expressed as [16]:\nY\n1 = 1\nZ1\n,Y 2 = g2 + jb2 = 1\nZ0\n+ j tan(θ2)\nZ2\n,\nY3 = g3 + jb3 = 1\nRL\n+ j tan(θ3)\nZ3\n.\n(1)\nThe input impedance is desired to equal toZ0 at dual band. Therefore,\nthis design goal can be given equivalently by\nY ∗\n2 = Y1\nY3 + jY1 tan(θ1)\nY1 + jY3 tan(θ1), (2)\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, PIER 88, 2008 123\nwhere the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate symbol. This\nmatching problem is similar to the single transmission line\ntransformation in [17, 18]. From (1) and (2), the following equation\ncan be obtained as\ng\n2 − jb2 = Y1\ng3 + j(b3 + Y1 tan(θ1))\nY1 − b3 tan(θ1)+ jg3 tan(θ1). (3)\nSeparating and rearranging the real and imagine parts of (3), the\nequations can be obtained as\n{ Y1(g2 − g3)=( g2b3 − g3b2) tan(θ1),\nY1(b2 + b3)=\n(\nb2b3 + g2g3 − Y 2\n1\n)\ntan(θ1). (4)\nSubstituting (1) into (4), and after some straightforward manipulation,\nEquation (4) in terms of characteristic impedances can be expressed\nas,\n\n\n\nZ\n2Z3(RL − Z0)= Z1 tan(θ1)[Z2RL tan(θ3) − Z3Z0 tan(θ2)],\nZ0Z1RL[Z3 tan(θ2)+ Z2 tan(θ3)]\n=\n[(\nZ2\n1 − Z0RL\n)\nZ2Z3 + Z2\n1 Z0RL tan(θ2) tan (θ3)\n]\ntan(θ1).\n(5)\nTo express brieﬂy, the normalized coeﬃcients, which are signiﬁcant\nwhen they are positive and real, are deﬁned as,\nk = RL\nZ0\n,z 1 = Z1\nZ0\n,z 2 = Z2\nZ0\n,z 3 = Z3\nZ0\n. (6)\nSubstituting (6) into (5), the Equation (5) can be simpliﬁed as,\n\n\n\nz2z3(k − 1) = z1 tan(θ1)[z2k tan(θ3) − z3 tan(θ2)],\nz1k [z3 tan(θ2)+ z2 tan(θ3)]\n=\n[(\nz2\n1 − k\n)\nz2z3 + z2\n1k tan(θ2) tan(θ3)\n]\ntan(θ1).\n(7)\nIt should be pointed out that θn, n =1 , 2, 3 are θnf1 and θnf2 while\noperating at dual frequencies f1,f 2. Solutions of (7) will be discussed\nin the following sections.\n3. SOLUTIONS OF DESIGN EQUATIONS\nThere are three variables in the design equation (7) for this dual band\ntransformer. So we can determine one variable manually and consider\nit as an independent variable.\n124 Wu, Liu, and Li\n3.1. The Electrical and Physical Length Solutions\nTo assure (7) can be satisﬁed in dual band (supposed center frequencies\nsatisfy f2 ≥ f1, namely,f2 = pf1, p ≥ 1), the following equation should\nbe applied,\ntanθnf1 = ±tanθnf2,n =1 , 2, 3. (8)\nThe solution of (8) is given by\nθnf1 ± θnf2 = mπ, n =1 , 2, 3.m ∈ N+. (9)\nSince small transformer is helpful for micr owave engineers to fulﬁll\nminiaturization, the situation that the + sign and m = 1 [8] is chosen\nand from (9) the physical lengths can be obtained as follows,\nl = l1 = l2 = l3 = 1\n2(1 +p)λ1, (10)\nwhere λ1 is the wavelength off1. With the line lengths known, we can\nobtain the following parameters,\nα = tanθ1 = tanθ2 = tanθ3 = tan\n( π\n1+ p\n)\n. (11)\nIt is necessary to note that the li, i =1 , 2, 3 can also be unequal (For\nexample: l1 = ml2), as long as the ﬁnal expression (7) is unchanged\nwith operating at both f1 and f2. Considering that the corresponding\nphysical lengths are large, this unequal li case will not be discussed in\nthe following sections.\n3.2. The Characteristic Impedances Discussion\nUsing (11), (7) can be expressed as\n{ z2z3(k − 1) = z1α2(z2k − z3),\nz1k(z3 + z2)=( z2\n1 − k)z2z3 + z2\n1kα2. (12)\nBecause there are three variables namely z1,z 2,z 3 in (12), it is\nnecessary to deﬁne one of the variables for obtaining the other ones.\nWe suppose thatz\n1 is known here, the solution of (12) can be discussed\nin the following diﬀerent cases of k:\nA. One case: when k = 1, namely,Z0 = RL, (12) can be rewritten\nas\n{ z2 = z3,\n2z1z2 =\n(\nz2\n1 − 1\n)\nz2\n2 + z2\n1α2. (13)\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, PIER 88, 2008 125\nTo assure z2 and z3 are positive and real, the values can be obtained\nas,\nz2 = z3 =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nz\n1\n[\n1 −\n√\n1+( 1 − z2\n1)α2\n]\n(z2\n1 − 1) , 0 <z 1 ≤ 1.\nz1\n[\n1 ±\n√\n1+( 1 − z2\n1)α2\n]\n(z2\n1 − 1) , 1 <z 1 ≤\n√\n1+ α2\nα2 .\n(14)\nB. Another case: when k ̸= 1, namely, Z0 ̸= RL, (12) can be\nrewritten as,\n{\nCz2\n2 + Dz2 + E =0 ,\nz3 = Az2 + B. (15)\nwhere\nA = z2\n1kα2 − k2α2 − k2 + k\nz2\n1α2 − kα2 + k2 − k ,B = z1kα2(k − 1)\nz2\n1α2 − kα2 + k2 − k,\nC = A(k − 1),D = −2B, E = z1α2B.\nThe solution of (15) can be obtained as,\n\n\n\nz2 = B ±\n√\nB2 − CE\nA(k − 1) ,\nz3 = Az2 + B.\n(16)\nTo assure z2,z 3 are positive and real, and after some straightforward\nmanipulation, (16) can be rewritten as,\nz2 =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nz\n1α2\n(\n1−\n√\n(k+α2k−z2\n1α2)\n)\nz2\n1α2−kα2−k+1 , 0<z1 ≤\n√\nk+α2k−1\nα2 .\nz1α2\n(\n1 ±\n√\n(k+α2k−z2\n1α2)\n)\nz2\n1α2−kα2−k+1 ,\n√\nk+α2k−1\nα2 <z1 <\n√\nk+α2k\nα2 .\nz3 = Az2 + B. (17)\nObviously, there are two solutions in (14) and (17) in diﬀerent cases.\nConsidering the practical microwave implementation, one of them will\nbe discarded, which will be discussed in the following.\n126 Wu, Liu, and Li\n3.3. The Final Characteristic Impedances Solutions\nFrom the above discussion, it is interesting that (17) includes (14).\nCombining (14) and (17), we can choose (17) to analyze ﬁnally. And\nthen (17) is separated into two diﬀerent parts, which follow as\nz\n2 =\nz1α2\n(\n1−\n√ (\nk + α2k − z2\n1α2))\nz2\n1α2 − kα2 − k +1 , 0 <z 1 ≤\n√\nk + α2k\nα2 . (18a)\nz2 =\nz1α2\n(\n1+\n√ (\nk+α2k−z2\n1α2))\nz2\n1α2−kα2−k+1 ,\n√\nk+α2k−1\nα2 <z1<\n√\nk+α2k\nα2 .(18b)\nIf z1 is in the scope of (18b), the subtraction of (18b) and (18a) is\n∆z2 =\n2z1α2\n(√ (\nk + α2k − z2\n1α2))\nz2\n1α2 − kα2 − k +1 > 0, (19)\n(19) means that the value of (18b) is larger than one of (18a) when\nz1 is the same. Especially, when z1 →\n√\nk + α2k − 1/\n√\nα2 in (18b),\nz2 →∞ can be obtained. But in (18a), z2 will be a positive and real\nnumber, which is more practical in microwaveengineering. Considering\npractical realization in terms of microstrip line, the values of z1,z 2,z 3\nshould be in the adequate range. Apparently, (18b) is not suitable to\npractical design because the characteristic impedances are very high.\nSo, we only choose (18a) as the ﬁnal design for diﬀerent values ofz\n1 in\nthis paper.\nHere, the aforementioned discussion can be summarized. If z1 is\nknown and in the range of (20a), the ﬁnal generalized design equations\nof z\n2 and z3 can be expressed as:\n0 <z 1 ≤\n√\nk + α2k\nα2 , (20a)\nz2 =\nz1α2\n(\n1 −\n√ (\nk + α2k − z2\n1α2))\nz2\n1α2 − kα2 − k +1 , (20b)\nz3 =\nkz1α2\n(\nk −\n√\nk + α2k − z2\n1α2\n)\nz2\n1α2 − kα2 + k2 − k . (20c)\nSo, we can obtain diﬀerent impedances solutions with diﬀerent\nvalues of z1 according to (20). When the values of impedances are\nvery large or small, they can be adjusted using diﬀerent values of z1.\nThis is the main advantage of this proposed dual band transformer.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, PIER 88, 2008 127\n3.4. Special Cases of Solutions\nLet us consider some special cases of (20).\nWhen z1 =\n√\nk, (20) can be simpliﬁed as the following equation,\nz1 =\n√\nk, z 2 =\n√\nkα2\n1+\n√\nk\n,z 3 = kα2\n1+\n√\nk\n. (21)\nWhen z1 =\n√\nk(1 +α2) − 1/\n√\nα2, (k ≥ 1), (20) can be simpliﬁed as\nthe following equation based on the limitation characteristic,\nz1 =\n√\nk(1 +α2) − 1\nα2 ,z 2 = z1α2\n2 ,z 3 = kz1α2\nk +1 . (22)\nWhen z1 =\n√\nk(1 +α2)/\n√\nα2, (20) can become as follows,\nz1 =\n√\nk(1 +α2)\nα2 ,z 2 = z3 = z1α2. (23)\nThis special case including (23) is the same with the results of [14]\nand [15], and (23) has been applied in dual band couplers and power\ndividers in compact structure.\n4. ANALYSIS OF SOLUTIONS\nIn this section, using (11), we analyze the characteristics of (20) against\ndiﬀerent p and k.\n4.1. Single Matching Band\nThe p will be very large when f\n2 ≫ f1. Considering α ≈ π/(1 +\np) → 0, the electrical length of this transformer will become very\nsmall. When f2 →∞ , the total transformer will be considered as\na lumped inductance and capacitance transforming network, namely\nthe resistances are connected directly with lumped components. This\ncharacteristic is similar with the dual band transformer in two sections\nwhen f\n2 →∞ [8].\nIn addition, in the case that p is very large, we can increase the\nlength of transmission lines by choosing a larger m to avoid too small\nphysical length,\nl = m\n2(1 +p)λ1. (24)\n128 Wu, Liu, and Li\nAnd the corresponding parameter becomes,\nα = tan\n( mπ\n1+ p\n)\n. (25)\nBased on (24), the value ofm can increase along with the value ofp,i t\nis suitable that m satisﬁes 4m<p + 5 [9] because the physical length\nshould be kept in the adequate range.\n4.2. Equal Dual Band and Quarter Wavelength Transformer\nIf f2 = f1, then p = 1 and α →∞ , the electrical length is π/2 which\nstands for one quarter wavelength of f1. Based on the results of (21)–\n(23) and conventional transmission line matching concept, z1 =\n√\nk\nis only chosen in this case and z2,z 3 →∞ can be obtained. So, this\ntransformer in this case can be considered as the conventional single\nband quarter wavelength transformer [16].\n4.3. Symmetry Properties\nSimilar with the transformer of [8], this proposed compact transformer\nis also symmetry. If the k in (20) is replaced by k\n0 and 1/k0. The\nfollowing relationship can be expressed as,\nz1|k=k0 = k0z1|k=1/k0 , (26)\nk0z2|k=k0 = z3|k=1/k0 . (27)\nIn fact, the results of the impedances in the case k = k0 < 1 can be\nobtained by changing the sequence of ones in the case k1 =1 /k0 > 1.\n5. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\nIn this section, some numerical examples are presented based on (20)–\n(23). In these examples, the reﬂections coeﬃcients|Γ| are with respect\nto normalized transmission line characteristic impedance Z0 =1 .\nTherefore, it is convenient to use the normalized parameters (6).\n5.1. Example 1\nConsidering that the example f1 = 1 GHz ,f 2 = 2 GHz ,k =4 ,w e\ncan obtain that the physical length is λ1/6 and α equals\n√\n3. Four\ndiﬀerent solutions with diﬀerent z1, where case 2 is z1 =\n√\nk and case\n4i s z1 =\n√\nk + α2k/\n√\nα2, are presented in Table 1. The responding\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, PIER 88, 2008 129\nreﬂection coeﬃcients are shown in Fig. 3. We can ﬁnd that the\nmatching bandwidth of case 4 is wider than the other cases. However,\nthe corresponding characteristic impedances are larger which makes it\ndiﬃcult to be fabricated in practical microstrip lines.\nTable 1.Solutions of Example 1.\nCase 1\nz1 =1\nCase 2\nz1 =2\nCase 3\nz1 =2 .2\nCase 4\nz1 =4 /\n√\n3\nz2 0.651 2.000 2.978 6.928\nz3 1.578 4.000 5.061 6.928\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\nFrequency (GHz)\n|Γ|(dB)\nCase1\nCase2\nCase3\nCase4\nFigure 3.

The special solution (23) (namely, the case 4 in\nexample 1) is adopted, and that is z1 =2\n√\nk/\n√\n3. But the parameter\nk is variable.\nThe corresponding results are listed in Table 2, and the reﬂection\ncoeﬃcients are shown in Fig. 3. It can be observed from Fig. 3 that\nthe bandwidth will become narrow as the parameter k increases.\n130 Wu, Liu, and Li\nTable 2.Solutions of Example 2.\nCase 1\nk =1\nCase 2\nk =2\nCase 3\nk =3\nCase 4\nk =5\nz1 1.155 1.633 2.000 2.582\nz2 = z3 3.464 4.899 6.000 7.746\n5.3. Example 3\nLet us consider the example f1 = 1 GHz, f2 = pf1, k = 4, which two\nkinds of the parameter p (p is close to 1 (A) and p is very large (B))\nare used, the special solution (23) is only considered.\nTable 3.Solutions of Example 3(A).\nCase 1\np =1\nCase 2\np =1 .5\nCase 3\np =2 .5\nCase 4\np =3\nz1 2.000 2.103 2.558 2.828\nz2 = z3 ∞ 19.919 4.022 2.828\nl/λ1 1/4 1/5 1/7 1/8\nIt is interesting that case 1 is similar with case 4 in Fig. 5. They\nare all matched at 1 and 3 GHz. It is necessary to point out that case 1\nis the same with quarter wavelength transformer, which can match at\nits odd harmonics. The diﬀerence between case 1 and case 4 is that the\nreﬂection coeﬃcient bandwidth of case 4 is smaller than case 1. And\nthe stubs are necessary in case 4 while the stubs do not exist in case 1.\nTable 3 shows the design parameters employed in the example 3(A).\nWhen p is very large (3B) and m = 1, the design parameters\nare listed in Table 4 and the corresponding reﬂections coeﬃcients are\nshown in Fig. 6.\nFigure 6 shows that the matching frequencyf\n2 is much higher and\nthe matching characteristics atf1 of case 1–4 change little whenp ≫ 1.\nThe curve of case 4 overlaps the one of case 3 shown in Fig. 6 when\nf< 10 GHz because p ≫ 10 in case 3 and 4, which means that the\nreﬂection coeﬃcients of case 3 and 4 is very similar in the frequency\nrange f< 10 GHz.\nProgress In Electromagnetics Research, PIER 88, 2008 131\nTable 4.Solutions of Example 3(B).\nCase 1\np =5\nCase 2\np =9\nCase 3\np =2 0\nCase 4\np = 100\nz1 4.000 6.472 13.419 64.309\nz2 = z3 1.333 0.683 0.305 0.062\nl/λ1 1/12 1/20 1/42 1/202\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\nFrequency\n|Γ\u0000|(dB)\nCase 1\nCase 2\nCase 3\nCase 4\nFigure 5.
