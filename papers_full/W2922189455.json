    "abstract": "Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) is a test method used for assessment of mechanical condition of transformer active parts. Its biggest problem is the interpretation of test results, namely the relationship between scale of differences between compared curves and the decision for further operation of the given transformer. Very often visible differences between two FRA curves do not mean that there is a deformation in the winding. The cause of the curve shift may come from other elements of the transformer that influence inductive or capacitive parameters. This paper takes under consideration the influence of both capacitance and inductance changes on transformer frequency response (FR). The analysis is performed with the computer model of a transformer and also some experimental results are presented, showing the influence of capacitance and inductance changes on the FR of real transformers. The results of research showed that this influence may lead to misleading effects on the shape of FR characteristics. The paper presents an analysis that can be used in the assessment of FRA measurement, especially in the case of uncertain data comparison results.",
