  "abstract": "The subject matter of this paper refers to the assessment of the technical condition of a power transformer core and windings based on vibroacoustic measurements taken during a transient operation state of the appliance diagnosed -at a transformer unit switch on.The paper presents preliminary results of the research work carried out, which aims at elaborating a new diagnostic and assessment method of the degree of the transformer core and winding pressing using the so-called modified vibroacoustic method.The paper characterizes the measurement path and the assessment method of the core and winding pressing degree based on the selected analyses of the vibroacoustic signal registered.The original research results presented in the paper were obtained at a real 400 kV A power transformer switch on in laboratory conditions -for a regular operation condition and for modeled core damage.",
