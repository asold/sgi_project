A likely target ofM is\nthe transformer (tra) gene, which is required for female development\nin L. cuprina [2]. The L. cuprina tra gene is sex-specifically spliced\nsuch that only the female transcript encodes a full-length\nfunctional protein. A very similar mechanism determines sex in\nthe housefly [3] and tephritid fruit flies [4–6]. In Drosophila\nmelanogaster, tra is required for female development buttra RNA\nsplicing is regulated by the female-specific RNA binding protein\nSXL [7]. In the honeybeeApis mellifera, the apparenttra ortholog\nfeminizer (fem) is regulated by heterozygosity of thecomplementary sex\ndeterminer gene (csd) [8,9]. csd heterozygotes are females, whereas\nhomozygotes and hemizygotes develop as males.fem transcripts are\nsex-specifically spliced with only the female transcript coding for\nFEM protein.fem RNA could be directly regulated by CSD, which\nis a putative splicing factor [10]. An ortholog oftra is required for\nfemale development in the hymenopteranNasonia vitripennis, buttra\ngene expression appears to be controlled by a maternal imprinting\nmechanism rather than a male-determining gene [11].\nIn L. cuprina, the female and major maletra transcripts differ\nonly in the choice of splice donor site for the first intron. The\nfemale site is 311 bp upstream of the male splice donor site. The\nmale exon contains multiple in-frame translation stop codons. The\nTRA protein encoded by the female transcript contains a high\nproportion of serine and arginine amino acids, characteristic of SR\nsplicing regulators [12]. Indeed, theD. melanogasterTRA protein is\na potent enhancer of RNA splicing [13]. InD. melanogaster, TRA\ntogether with the RNA binding proteins TRA2 and RBP1,\nregulates the RNA splicing of transcripts from thedoublesex (dsx)\nand fruitless (fru) genes [14]. With regard todsx, the TRA/TRA2/\nRBP1 complex binds to six very similar 13 nucleotide sites within\nthe 39UTR of the female transcript and enhance the use of\na nearby weak splice acceptor site [15,16]. The binding sites are\noften referred to as TRA/TRA2 sites or thedsxRE. TRA appears\nto regulate dsx RNA splicing inL. cuprina in a similar manner as\neight predicted TRA/TRA2 sites were found in the female-\nspecific exon [17]. In support of this model, the RNA recognition\nmotif (RRM) of theL. cuprinaTRA2 ortholog is very similar to the\nRRMs of theDrosophila, tephritid and housefly TRA2 proteins [2].\nThe presence of a cluster of four predicted TRA/TRA2 sites\nwithin the first intron and another site in the male exon of theL.\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56303\ncuprina tra gene suggested that tra RNA splicing is likely\nautoregulated [2]. tra RNA splicing also appears to be auto-\nregulated in the housefly [3] and tephritid fruit flies [4,5,18]. The\npresence of maternally inheritedtra RNA transcripts could provide\nsufficient TRA protein to initiate the autoregulation of zygotictra\nRNA splicing. This model of maternal activation oftra was first\nproposed inC. capitata [4] and recently confirmed forM. domestica\ntra [3].\nThe expression of M in male embryos somehow inhibits the\nfemale mode oftra RNA splicing. It is not known howM regulates\ntra splicing inL. cuprina, housefly or tephritid fruit flies but several\npossible mechanisms have been proposed [2–4].M could encode\na protein that directly interacts with TRA and inhibits its function.\nIn support of this model, the blowfly, housefly and tephritid fruit\nfly TRA proteins contain a highly conserved amino terminal\ndomain that is absent from the Drosophila TRA protein [2–4].\nAlternatively, M could bind to tra RNA transcripts and either\ninhibit the female-specific splice or enhance the male-specific\nsplice. For example, M could inhibit the binding of TRA/TRA2\nto tra transcripts. IfM interacts with thetra RNA transcript, then it\nwould be predicted that sequence motifs in addition to the TRA/\nTRA2 sites would be conserved in thetra genes of related species.\nWith the aim of identifying motifs that may play a role intra sex-\nspecific splicing, in this study we have isolated and compared the\ntra gene sequences from three blowfly species,L. sericata, Cochliomyia\nhominivorax (New World screwworm) andC. macellaria with the tra\ngene fromL. cuprina. Based on molecular phylogenetic analyses,L.\nsericata is the closest relative ofL. cuprinain the subfamily Lucilinae\n[19,20]. Similarly, C. hominivorax and C. macellaria are very closely\nrelated but belong to the Chrysomyinae subfamily. We find that\nthe blowfly tra genes have a similar organization and contain\nconserved motifs that may be important for sex-specific splicing.\nResults\nOrganization and Conservation of theC. hominivorax, C.\nmacellaria and L. sericata traGenes\nTo isolate thetra gene fromC. hominivoraxand C. macellaria(Chtra\nand Cmtra), we used the same strategy as used previously to isolate\nthe L. cuprina tra gene (Lctra) [2]. RT-PCR was performed using\ndegenerate primers based on conserved amino acid motifs in the\nTRA protein to obtain a fragment of thetra transcript. For L.\nsericata, tra contigs had been identified in several transcriptome\nassemblies [21]. Additional RT-PCR reactions and 59 and 39\nRACE were performed with gene specific primers and male and\nfemale RNA templates to obtain full-length (Chtra and Lstra)o r\nnear full-length (Cmtra) transcript sequences. We found only one\nmajor transcript in males and one in females in all three species\n(Figure 1). The male transcripts have an additional exon with\nseveral in-frame stop codons. The genomic organization of thetra\ngenes was determined by comparison of cDNA and genomic DNA\nsequences. All the tra genes have an identical exon/intron\norganization, with four protein-coding exons, three introns and\none male-specific exon (Figure 1). The TRA proteins encoded by\nthe female-specific transcripts are highly similar (Figure S1).\nPreviously identified domains (e.g. arginine/serine rich) are\nparticularly well conserved. In pairwise comparisons, the TRA\nproteins from species within the same genus were 91 to 92%\nidentical and 92 to 94% similar (identical plus conservative amino\nacids). However, the TRA proteins were only 67 to 70% identical\nand 78 to 80% similar when comparingCochliomyia with Lucilia\nTRA proteins. Similarly at the nucleotide level, the tra coding\nregions are 91 to 93% identical within the same genus but only\n73–74% identical outside the genus.\nThe male and female transcripts arise from alternative splicing,\ndiffering in which splice donor site is used to join with the intron 1\nsplice acceptor site (Figure 2). We previously suggested thattra\nalternative splicing inL. cuprina is likely to be autoregulated as 5\nmotifs that matched a TRA/TRA2 consensus sequence (U/AC/\nAA/UA/UCAAUCAACA) were identified in the intron and one\nTRA/TRA2 site was in male exon M2. The five sites in the intron\nwere clustered towards the 39 end. tra splicing is likely auto-\nregulated inC. hominivorax, C. macellariaand L. sericataas in all three\nspecies there are either four (Chtra, Cmtra) or five (Lstra) TRA/\nTRA2 sites within the regulated female first intron. Moreover, the\nrelative location of the TRA/TRA2 sites is very similar to that in\nLctra, with one TRA/TRA2 site towards the 39 end of the male\nexon and a cluster of sites in the intron. InLstra and Chtra, the\nTRA/TRA2 cluster is towards the 39 end of the intron as inLctra,\nwhereas in the largerCmtra intron the sites are more towards the\nmiddle of the intron.\nIn contrast to the well-conserved TRA/TRA2 sites, the male\nfirst introns and male exons show little overall nucleotide sequence\nsimilarity. The sequence identity of the male intron ranged from\n56% (Lctra/Lstra) to 28% (Cmtra/Lstra), the low identity of the latter\nis partly because of an insertion in theCmtra intron (see below).\nThe male exon was more conserved with highest similarity within\na genus (85%Cochliomyia, 79%Lucilia), than between genera (47 to\n50%). To identify motifs that may play a role in the regulated\nsplicing of the first intron, we searched for conserved sequences by\nperforming pairwise comparisons, multiple sequence alignments\nand by MEME analyses.\nPustell DNA matrix analyses of the male intron DNA sequences\nwere undertaken to obtain a visual representation of how the\nsequences were related. Only the comparisons within a genus\nshowed significant blocks of similarity. The conserved blocks were\nclustered at the ends of the introns, particularly the 39 end and also\naround and including the cluster of TRA/TRA2 sites (Figure 3).\nThis analysis also revealed an insertion of about 1100 bp towards\nthe 39 end of the Cmtra intron, which has separated the TRA/\nTRA2 cluster from the splice acceptor site. We then performed\nmultiple sequence alignments, focusing on the region of the intron\ncontaining the TRA/TRA2 sites and also the 39 end of the intron.\nThe spacing between the TRA/TRA2 sites is generally well\nconserved with only a few minor insertions/deletions (Figure 4A,\nred). In the Lucilia species, the most 5 9 site contains two\noverlapping motifs that match the TRA/TRA2 consensus. Three\nof the four TRA/TRA2 sites are followed by the sequence\nTACC/TA (Figure 4A, blue). This sequence is also found after the\nsingle TRA/TRA2 site in the male exon (Figure S2). This suggests\nthat the consensus TRA/TRA2 site in blowflies may be longer\nthan the 13 bp motif identified previously [2]. If so, the eight\nTRA/TRA2 sites in the 39 UTR of the L. cuprina female dsx\ntranscript [17] should be followed by the TACC/TA motif.\nIndeed, the motif is immediately 39 of four of the eight sites.\nFurthermore, all eight sites are followed by a TAC sequence. A\nlogo derived from an alignment of 26 bp sequences containing the\npredicted TRA/TRA2 sites in the blowflytra genes and theLcdsx\ngene is shown in Figure 4B. An optimal motif of 18 to 19 bp is\nclearly seen from inspection of this graphical representation of the\nalignment. In addition to the TRA/TRA2 sites, there are two\nmotifs near the most 59 TRA/TRA2 site that are well conserved\n(Figure 4A, green). Neither of the motifs contains a predicted\nbinding site for RBP1 or the TRA2-ISS site, previously suggested\nto be important fortra sex-specific splicing in tephritids [18]. We\nnext asked if the motifs contain recognition sites for any other\nDrosophila RNA binding protein for which the RNA binding\nprotein specificities are known. The only hit was to a binding site\nBlowfly Transformer Genes\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56303\nFigure 1.tra gene organization and sex-specific transcripts inC. hominivorax(Ch), C. macellaria(Cm) andL. sericata(Ls). tra genes of all 3\nspecies consist of 4 exons (red boxes) and one male specific exon (blue box).

The sequence, AUGAAUUU, is within the motif upstream\nof the most 59 TRA/TRA2 site. However, dUNR binding tomsl-2\nRNA requires the binding of SXL to an adjacent polyU sequence\n[22], which is not present in thetra intron. Thus, it would appear\nunlikely that UNR would bind to the conserved motif in thetra\nintron. Nevertheless, the possibility that UNR binds to tra\ntranscripts should not be completely discounted given that UNR\nbinds to many sex-specifically processed transcripts inDrosophila\n[23].Interestingly, the motif downstream of the most 59 TRA/\nTRA2 site shows a partial (7/8 inChtra) match to the sequence\n[(59-(U/G)GAAGAU(U/A)-39] suggested by Verhulst et al [11] to\nbe a potential binding site for TRA/TRA2 inNasonia vitripennisand\nApis mellifera. Alignment of the DNA sequences of the 39 end of the\nintron identified a conserved type A RBP1 binding site\n(DCADCTTA) about 100 bp upstream of the splice acceptor site\n(Figure 4C, purple). This was immediately followed by a conserved\nmotif that matched the 39 half of the extended TRA/TRA2 site\n(red). A multiple sequence alignment of the male exon sequences\nidentified the conserved TRA/TRA2 site near the 39 end but\nthere were few other blocks of high conservation apart from the\nsplice donor site (Figure S2). A short T-rich motif occurred about\n40 bp downstream of the splice donor site (green). The binding site\nfor the neuronal protein ELAV in the Drosophila ewg RNA is\ncharacterized by short and variably spaced polyU motifs [24].\nAdditional short T-rich motifs occur elsewhere in the male exon\nincluding the 59 end (i.e. female splice donor site) and 39 to the\nTRA/TRA2 site. ELAV regulates the alternative splicing ofewg\ntranscripts in neurons. Perhaps the short U-rich motifs are part of\nthe binding site for a constitutively expressed ELAV-like protein in\ncalliphorids.\nWe used MEME to search for sequence motifs in the male\nexons and male introns that are conserved at the nucleotide level\nbut not necessarily occur at similar positions (Tables S1 and S2). In\nthe male exon, the highest ranked motif contained the single\nTRA/TRA2 site (Figure 5A). Motifs 2 and 3 were located about\n30 and 100 bp downstream from the start of the male exon\nrespectively and did not contain RBP1 or ISS sites. Motif 2\ncontained the T-rich sequence identified above whereas Motif 4\ncontained the female splice donor site and thus was of less interest\n(Table S1). Motif 5 was located about 30 bp upstream from the\nsingle TRA/TRA2 site (Figure 5A). None of the remaining motifs\nhad low p-values in all four species. Of the ten highest ranked\nmotifs identified in the male introns, four of the top five contained\na TRA/TRA2 site (Table S2). Motif 3 has a relatively high GC\ncontent and was located in a region of the intron that is otherwise\npoorly conserved (Figure 5B). Motif 6 is T-rich, occurs at various\nlocations within the intron and the 39 end matches theDrosophila\nISS site. Motifs 7 and 8 are found near the 39 end of the intron.\nMotif 8 contains part of the RBP1 type A identified by sequence\nalignments whereas motif 7 is located between this motif and the\nsplice acceptor site. Motifs 9 and 10 occur within the cluster of\nTRA/TRA2 sites with 9 downstream of the third site and 10\nupstream of the first TRA/TRA2 site. Motif 10 contains the\nconserved sequence previously identified (Figure 4A). Neither the\nmotifs identified by MEME analysis or multiple sequence\nalignment contained binding sites for other Drosophila RNA\nbinding proteins for which the RNA binding protein specificities\nare known (http://rbpdb.ccbr.utoronto.ca/).\nWe next asked if any of the conserved motifs occur intra genes\nin non-calliphorids. We searched the tsetse fly ( Gmmtra) and\nhousefly (Mdtra) tra genes as these are the closest relatives for which\ncomplete gene sequences are available. About 35 bp upstream of\nthe cluster of TRA/TRA2 sites in the Gmmtra first intron is\na sequence (59-AATTTCTGTAGAA-39) that is a 10/13 match to\nthe conserved sequence that is upstream of the first TRA/TRA2\nsite in the male intron of calliphoridtra genes (Figure 4A). Of the\nmotifs identified by MEME analysis, only motif 5 in the male exon\n(Figure 5A) was found in the Gmmtra gene. The sequence\n(AAAATATATTGGATGT) occurs within the sex-specific female\nintron, but not within any of the male exons [3].\nThere is considerable conservation around the splice donor and\nacceptor sites of the alternatively spliced first intron (Figure 6). The\nfemale donor site sequence TG/GTAATTTT is invariant in the\nfour blowfly species. The sequence is also highly conserved in\ntsetse fly, housefly and tephritid fruit flies. In all of these species\na male-specific exon immediately follows the first protein coding\nexon. The G at the -1 position is the first nucleotide of a codon for\na highly conserved glycine (first Gly in sequence discussed below).\nThe T at the -2 position is in the third position of a cysteine\n(ChTRA, CmTRA) or phenylalanine (LsTRA, LCTRA) codon\nand so would not be expected to be so highly conserved. The male\ndonor site is also highly conserved and in all species the sequence\nshows a strong match to theDrosophila consensus sequence (AG/\nGTAAGT) [25]. Indeed, when we analyzed the tra gene\nnucleotide sequences using a Drosophila splice site prediction\nprogram (NNsplice) [26], the male splice site donor site received\na stronger prediction score. For example, forChtra, the scores were\n0.93 and 0.47 for the male and female donor sites respectively (a\nscore of 0.4 is the cutoff for significance). The splice acceptor sites\nalso all generally match the Drosophila consensus. The exon\nsequence that follows the acceptor site, GTGAAGGTTC is\ninvariant in blowflies and highly conserved in the other fly species\nwe examined (Figure 6). This may be partly because the amino\nacids encoded by the exon sequence (Gly-Glu-Gly-Ser) are highly\nconserved. Nevertheless, some nucleotide variation might have\nbeen expected at the variable third position of the codons. This\nconservation suggests that the conserved exonic sequences\nadjacent to the female splice donor and acceptor sites may be\nimportant for efficient sex-specific splicing.

In housefly and medfly,\nthe male form oftra RNA first appears in precellular embryos after\nthe initial onset of zygotic gene expression [3,27]. InL. cuprina,w e\nwere unable to detect either male form oftra RNA in embryos [2].\nIf the male transcript was present at a significantly lower level than\nthe female transcript this could have made detection difficult.\nAdditionally, we may have been unable to detect the male product\nif the shorter female product was preferentially amplified with\nmixed-sex RNA template. We therefore repeated the develop-\nmental expression profile with L. sericata with the rationale that\nbecause the nucleotide sequence of the male exon is significantly\ndifferent (79% identity toL. cuprina), any amplification bias (if it\nexists) may be reduced. RT-PCR was performed from carefully\nstaged mixed-sex embryos and also pupae and adults. Male\nproduct was readily detected in embryos collected 3 to 4 hours\nafter egg laying and in all later staged embryos (Figure 7A). In\naddition, relatively low amounts of male product were present in\nRNA from 2–3 h old embryos. Although the embryos were\npresumably an equal mix of males and females, there was stronger\namplification of the shorter female product. This suggests that the\nmale transcript is present at a lower level and/or there is\npreferential synthesis of the female product either because of an\namplification bias or more efficient reverse transcription. Cellular\nblastoderm formation was observed around 2 h of development.\nConsistent with this observation, expression of the cellularization\ngene Lsslam was first detected in 1–2 h embryos and readily seen in\n2–3 h embryos (Figure 7B) Thus inL. sericata, the zygotic male-\nspecific tra splicing occurs early in development around the time of\ncellularization.\ntra is Essential for Female Development inL. sericataand\nC. macellaria\nInjection of a 950 bp double-stranded Lctra RNA into the\nposterior end of preblastoderm L. cuprina caused about three\nquarters of the XX individuals to develop some male features [2].\nOf the XX flies, 2% showed complete sex reversal to male whereas\nmost (72%) developed with external male genitalia but with a wide\ninterocular width characteristic of females. In the absence of any\nmolecular markers to distinguish XY males from transformed XX\nmales, we used the partial sex transformation phenotype to\ndetermine if tra is required for female development inL. sericata\nand C. macellaria. About 300 preblastoderm L. sericata and C.\nmacellaria embryos were injected with a 799 bpLstra or 851 bp\nCmtra doublestranded RNA respectively. Partially transformed XX\nindividuals were identified based on the appearance of male\ngenitalia but female interocular width (Figure 8A, B and D, E).\nFrom the L. sericata embryos injections, we obtained 42 females\nwith normal genitalia and 10 partially transformed XX males.\nSimilarly, 18 females and 8 partially transformed XX males\ndeveloped from the C. macellaria embryos injected with Cmtra\ndsRNA. The partially transformed XX males showed evidence of\ndevelopment of testes and not ovaries (Figure 8C, F). We conclude\nthat tra is required for female development inL. sericata and C.\nmacellaria.\nDiscussion\nThe transformer genes from the blowfly species L. cuprina, L.\nsericata, C. hominivorax and C. macellaria have a remarkably similar\narrangement of exons/introns and TRA/TRA2 sites. In all species\nthe major male and female transcripts arise from a different choice\nof donor site for the splicing out of the first intron. In contrast, the\ntransformer genes from the tephritid fruit fliesC. capitata, B. oleaeand\nA. obliqua have complex splicing patterns, several male-specific\nexons and differ in the number and relative location of TRA/\nTRA2 sites [4,5,18]. The blowfly tra genes all contain a single\nTRA/TRA2 site near the 39 end of the male exon. Interestingly,\nthere is also at least one TRA/TRA2 site in the male exon that is\nimmediately downstream of the first protein coding exon (exon 1\nin blowfly tra genes) in the tephritid, housefly and tsetse fly (G.\nmorsitans morsitans) tra genes [3–5,18]. This suggests that binding of\nTRA/TRA2 to that male exon likely plays an important role in\nsplice site selection in females in these species.\nWe found that the TRA proteins from within the same genus\nwere highly similar (92–94%) but less similar when comparing\noutside the genus (78–80%). These results are consistent with\nprevious morphological and phylogenetic studies that showed that\nthe two Lucilia species are very closely related, as are the two\nCochliomyia species [19,20]. Similar results were obtained pre-\nviously comparing TRA proteins from different tephritid species\n[18]. TRA proteins from within the genusAnastrepha were highly\nsimilar (88–99%), but TRA proteins from different genera were\nless similar (54–64%). In contrast to the high similarity of the\ncoding regions, overall the nucleotide sequences of the regulated\nfirst intron of the calliphorid tra genes were rather poorly\nconserved. However, this highlighted several conserved sequence\nblocks that are likely important for sex-specific splicing. The\nnucleotide sequences showed particularly high similarity around\nthe cluster of four TRA/TRA2 sites, the exon/intron junctions\nand the 39 end of the intron. The nucleotide sequences adjacent to\nthe first TRA/TRA2 site (i.e. most 59) were particularly well\nconserved in blowflies. These sequence motifs could potentially be\nbinding sites for other proteins that could interact with TRA or\nTRA2. Our analysis of the TRA/TRA2 binding sites led to the\nrealization that the optimal binding site may be up to 5 nucleotides\nlonger than the 13 nt motif originally identified. In Drosophila,\nRBP1 binds to the 59 half and TRA2 to the 39 half of the 13 nt\nrepeat (i.e. TRA/TRA2 site) in the dsxRE [16]. We identified\na conserved RBP1 type A binding site near the 39 end of the first\nintron, which was followed by the 39 half of a longer TRA/TRA2\nsite. This suggests that this conserved motif could be bound by\nRBP1 and TRA2 and may play an important role in regulated\nsplicing of the tra first intron. MEME analyses identified several\nother motifs in the male exons and male introns that could play\na role in tra splicing. Lastly, we observed that the nucleotide\nsequences around the female and male splice donor sites were\nhighly conserved in all dipteran species where tra splicing is\nautoregulated. Such conservation suggests there is strong selection\npressure to maintain the sex-specific donor site nucleotide\nFigure 3. DNA dot matrices of blowflytra male intron DNA sequences.(A).

In calliphorids, the male splice donor site received\na higher score with splice site prediction software, suggesting this\nsite would be preferred by the spliceosome.\nWe propose a model for sex-specific regulation oftra splicing in\ncalliphorids that takes into account the conserved features\nidentified in this study (Figure 9). We suggest that in females,\nTRA/TRA2/RBP1 bound to the site in the male exon and the\nsites in the intron associate and prevent access of the spliceosome\nto the male splice donor site. Association of TRA/TRA2/RBP1\ncomplexes could be mediated by the proposed auto regulation\ndomain that occurs near the amino end of TRA in non-\ndrosophilid Diptera [11]. Other RNA binding proteins bound to\nconserved motifs near the most 59 TRA/TRA2 site in the intron\nand elsewhere in the intron may contribute to the inhibition of the\nmale splice donor site. In addition TRA/TRA2/RBP1 bound to\nthe site near the splice acceptor site could enhance splicing to the\nfemale donor site. In males, M interferes with TRA/TRA2/RBP1\nregulation of splicing. M could bind to one or more of the\nconserved motifs in the intron and directly interfere with RNA\nbinding and/or association of TRA/TRA2/RBP1 complexes.\nAnother possibility is that M repressestra gene expression, which\nwould be supported by the relatively low levels of the male form of\ntra transcript we detected inL. sericata embryos. Alternatively, M\nmay bind to the auto regulation domain and directly interfere with\nTRA/TRA2/RBP1 complex assembly (Figure 9). The latter is\nconsistent with preliminary data that the Chtra intron is sex-\nspecifically spliced inD. melanogaster(results not shown), which does\nnot use M to determine sex. In our model, the male splice site is\nutilized as this is preferred by the splicing machinery. This may be\nbecause the splice donor site can form an 8 bp double stranded\nhybrid withDrosophila U1 RNA (Figure 9) [28]. The female splice\ndonor site forms a less perfect match with the U1 RNA. Although\nthis model is clearly highly speculative it does make several\npredictions that could be tested using functional assays. For\nexample:\n1) Exchange of the male and female splice donor sites would\nresult in both sexes using the most 59 splice donor site (i.e.\nthe female site in the wild typetra gene).\n2) The male splice donor site would be preferred over the\nfemale donor site in splicing assays with extracts from\nDrosophila S2 cells (male) [13].\n3) The TRA/TRA2 site in the male exon would be\nparticularly important for splicing regulation\n4) The TRA/TRA2/RBP1 complex would bind to the site\nnear the splice acceptor site and this binding would be\nimportant for splicing efficiency in female calliphorids.\nSimilar to Drosophila, Lucilia embryos develop rapidly reaching\nthe cellular blastoderm stage around 2 h after egg laying. In\ncontrast, in C. capitata , cellular blastoderm formation occurs\nbetween 9 and 11 h after oviposition [27]. Taking advantage of\nthis elongated precellularization phase, Gasperi and colleagues\nfound that between 4 and 8 h of development both male and\nfemale embryos express several Cctra transcripts, including the\nadult male and female forms [27]. By 9 h of development male\nand female embryos express only the sex-specificCctra transcripts.\nThey proposed that M acts during the critical precellularization\nphase when maternal CcTRA protein is not sufficient to direct\nonly the female mode of splicing. BecauseLucilia embryos develop\nrapidly it is difficult to say if male transcripts appear prior to\ncellular blastoderm formation. Male Lstra transcripts were first\ndetected, albeit at relatively low levels, in 2–3 h embryos.\nTranscripts from the cellularization geneLsslam were first detected\nat 1–2 h and were readily apparent by 2–3 h. Thus M appears to\nact early inLucilia embryos around the time of cellular blastoderm\nformation. Consistent with an early setting of tra sex-specific\nexpression in blowflies, we found that injection oftra dsRNA into\nthe posterior end of L. sericata and C. macellaria embryos led to\npartially masculinized adults that had male genitalia but female\ninterocular width. These experiments confirmed the importance of\nTRA in female development inLucilia and Cochliomyia species.\nC. hominivorax, the New World screwworm fly, is a devastating\npest of livestock [29]. The sterile insect technique (SIT) was used to\neradicate C. hominivorax from North and Central America [30,31].\nThis involved the mass rearing and subsequent release of sterilized\nmale and female flies over the targeted area. SIT has also been\nsuccessfully used to control populations of medfly [32]. The\ndevelopment of medfly genetic sexing strains enabled programs to\nFigure 6.

Such single sex releases are more\neffective for population reduction than bisexual releases [34,35].\nThe isolation of theChtra gene will facilitate the development of\ntransgenic strains that carry repressible female lethal genes. For\nexample, the female first intron (which includes the male exon)\ncould be inserted into a lethal gene such that only the female\ntranscript codes for a functional protein [36]. Expression of the\nsex-specific lethal gene would be under the control of the\ntetracycline dependent transactivator or tTA, which can be simply\nrepressed by adding tetracycline to the diet [37]. By inserting the\nsex-specific intron fromC. capitata tra(Cctra) within the tTA gene,\nAlphey and colleagues developed an auto-regulated single\ncomponent tetracycline repressible female lethal system [36].\nMore recently, a two-component female embryo lethal system was\ndeveloped inA. suspensausing theCctra intron to confer sex-specific\nexpression of theAlhid cell death gene [38]. In general, it appears\nthat in order to assemble a system that functions very efficiently it\nis better to use components (promoter, sex-specific splicing, cell\ndeath) from endogenous genes (Li and Scott, unpublished\nobservations) [38]. Thus by isolating theChtra female intron, we\nhave obtained an essential component for building a ‘‘male-only’’\nstrain of C. hominivorax. In designing the lethal gene construct our\nanalysis suggests that it could be important to consider the exon\nsequences that flank the Chtra intron and that it may not be\nnecessary to include the entire intron.\nMaterials and Methods\nFly Strains and Rearing\nAdult L. sericata (strain CA06) and C. macellaria (strain NC09)\nwere maintained at 22uC in wire frame cages (22620620 cm)\ncovered with orthopedic stockinette.

Proposed model for regulation oftra splicing in calliphorids.The male splice donor site is preferred in males, possibly because this\nforms a stronger predicted hybrid with U1 snRNA (Drosophila sequence shown) than the female donor site. M is suggested to bind to the conserved\namino terminal domain of TRA and prevent assembly of the TRA/TRA2/RBP1 complex. See discussion for alternative mechanisms by which M could\nregulate tra splicing. In females the TRA/TRA2/RBP1 complex binds to the single site in the male exon and the cluster of sites in the intron. We\npropose that intermolecular interactions between bound complexes block use of the male splice donor site. This interaction may be facilitated by\nadditional RNA binding proteins that bind to conserved motifs (Figures 4,5). A TRA/TRA2/RBP1 complex is suggested to bind to the conserved motif\n(Figure 4B) near the 39 splice acceptor site and enhance splicing with the female splice donor site.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0056303.g009\nBlowfly Transformer Genes\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e56303\nMacVector and the Clustal Omega program. For MEME analyses\n[40], the male exon and male intron sequences were separately\nrun using the OOPS model while restricting the search to motifs\nbetween 10 and 15 bp in length. Custom Python scripts were used\nto search all of the resulting MEME motifs for the consensus\nsequences of the TRA/TRA2, RBP1 and ISS binding motifs from\nD. melanogaster, C. capitata, B. oleae and A. obliqua [18]. Custom\nPython scripts were used to determine if available PFMs and\nIUPAC binding motifs of RNA-binding proteins from RBPDB\n(http://rbpdb.ccbr.utoronto.ca/) could be found within our\nmotifs. For each PFM, PFMs were converted into regular\nexpressions, which were in turn searched for within the sequences\nused to create our MEME motifs using the Python regular\nexpression module’s search function. For each hit, the probability\nof that RNA-binding protein’s motif variant occurring was\ncalculated using that protein’s binding motif PFM. All probabilities\nwere low (,1e-6) suggesting the regular expression were very\nliberal in declaring matches but that the actual probability of the\nhit found within our sequences being that of the protein’s binding\nmotif very low. For each IUPAC motif, it was converted into\na regular expression and then broken down into overlapping\nsubstrings either of 10mers (for comparison to the sequences used\nto make our motifs) or 8mers (for the other requested motifs).\nThese 10mers or 8mers were then searched against the sequences\nused to create our MEME motifs using the Python regular\nexpression module.\nThe accession numbers for the genes reported in this study are:\nL. sericata transformergene, JX315620.\nC. macellaria transformergene, JX315619.\nC. hominivorax transformergene, JX315618.\nRNAi\ntra dsRNA of L.sericata and C. macellaria were synthesized with\neither T7, T3, or SP6 RNA polymerase using a linearized plasmid\nDNA as a template as previously described [2].
