INTRODUCTION\nW\nIDEBAND antennas and arrays are essential for high\ndata rate communications and software defined radios\n(SDRs). Wideband systems also enable increased spectral\nefficiency, increased data rates, Multiple-Input-Multiple-\nOutput (MIMO) and secure spread spectrum communica-\ntions. For many applications, these arrays would require a\nwide angle scanning range for comprehensive spatial cover-\nage. Notably, wideband arrays can replace several narrow-\nband antennas to reduce power, cost, and space requirements.\nIn this article, we are aiming at multi-functional array, specif-\nically for base-station communications with applications to\n4G LTE (long term evolution), the new AWS-3 (Advanced\nWireless Service) and “mid-band 5G” bands.\nAs mobile communication systems continue to develop, it\nis apparent that wideband, high gain, low-cost antennas are\nneeded to keep pace with data rates, especially in the band\nfrom 1-3 GHz [1]. More specifically, the second generation\n(2G) systems operated in the frequency bands 1710-\n1880 MHz (GSMA 1800) and 1850-1990 MHz (GSMA\n1900), while the third generation (3G) systems like CDMA\n2000 and WCDMA use the frequency band 1920-2170 MHz.\nThe LTE 4G systems, such as LTE2300 and LTE2500 use\ndesignated frequency bands 2300-2400 MHz and 2500-\n2690 MHz, and the AWS bands 1700-2100 MHz with\nthe 3G technology. Also, the GPS L1, L2 an L5 bands\n(1575, 1227, 1176 MHz, respectively.) are integral to today’s\ncommunication systems. Furthermore, the “mid-band 5G”\ntechnology systems uses a similar frequency range, from\n2300 to 2600 MHz. Thus, an UWB array with wide-angle\nscanning in the 1-3 GHz band is beneficial for 2G/3G/4G/5G\nbase stations, as it reduces hardware complexity.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Dimensions (units : mm) of array in Fig. 1(c).\nFIGURE 1. Pictorial representation of (a) the dual-polarized dipole array and (b) its\ninﬁnite array unit cell. The (c) dimensions of the design and (d) a printed circuit board\nstack-up (color coded) are also given to show the layer details.\nConcurrent to the aforementioned applications, there is\na movement in RF hardware towards differential compo-\nnents [2]. Differential configurations enable high dynamic\nrange, high linearity, and inherently lower distortions in\nresponse to noise and interference from power supplies.\nDistortions due to even order harmonics from nonlinear\ndevices can also be suppressed by differential lines [3].\nFurther, differentially fed antennas (e.g., dipoles) are inher-\nently compatible with differential amplifiers, thereby remov-\ning extraneous baluns across the RF chain and antenna feeds.\nThe removal of these unnecessary balun stages, especially\nin the case of ultra-wideband (UWB) balun, significantly\nreduces associated losses and phase/amplitude mismatches.\nRecently, many reduced size, weight, area, power and\ncost (SWAP-C) coupled dipole arrays have been developed\nfor UWB and multi-functional operation to meet the afore-\nmentioned needs. Thus far, these have been implemented\nwith a variety of accompanying feed designs [4]–[13]. Of\nFIGURE 2. Pictorial representation of a (a) Marchand Balun and (b) BWIT feeds.\ncourse, a dipole array over a ground plane requires a bal-\nanced excitation at the dipole terminal that extends a distance\nH above the ground plane (where λ/4 < H <λ / 2 to\nrespect image theory). Notably, traditional differential feeds\nhave inherent UWB performance at broadside, however, they\nexhibit common-modes when used in a phased array that\nscans to low angles [14], [15]. For instance, the UWB differ-\nential feeds in [16]–[19] exhibited common-mode resonances\nwhen scanning in the E-plane nearing angles of 45\n◦.A si s\nknown, these common-modes arise for particular scan angles\nand frequencies in the differential feed lines due to destruc-\ntive mutual coupling between elements in presence of a third\nconductor (i.e., ground plane). If not addressed properly,\nthese common-modes radiate in a manner that significantly\nreduces the efficiency and usable bandwidth of balanced\narray structures (i.e., PEC backed dipoles) [14], [15]. Hence,\na major challenge in the design of fully differential radios is\nthe vertically oriented balanced feed that does not resonate\nwhen scanning across large bandwidths.\nIn the past, the most prevalent way to suppress scan-\ndependent common-modes was to employ a balanced-to-\nunbalanced feed ( viz balun), thereby avoiding differential\nfeeding altogether [5], [7]–[12], [14]. A typical wideband\nbalun was the folded Marchand balun [5], [20], which\nhas been adapted to higher frequencies [10], [21] and in\nnovel fabrication methods [12]. However, as discussed above,\nthis approach introduces the need for more baluns later\nin the predominantly differential RF chain. Other meth-\nods have been explored to mitigate such modes without a\nbalun feed. For example, by employing conductive walls\nat the edges of the dipole arms for disruption of the cou-\npled fields [16], [17], [22], yet this approach introduces\ndesign complexities in fabricating a non-planar ground plane.\nAlso, resistive terminations have been used to attenuate the\ncommon-modes at the cost of efficiency [18], [19].\nIn this article, the novel dipole array in Fig. 1 is presented.\nThis differentially fed array achieves continuous wide-angle\nscans across its wideband operation. To realize resonance-\nfree scans, a new feed structure, referred to as the Balanced\nWideband Impedance Transformer (BWIT), is presented\n164 VOLUME 2, 2021\nFIGURE 3. Amplitude variation and phase imbalance of BWIT feed for broadside\n(solid) 45◦ (dashed), and 60◦ (circle-dashed) scanning cases.\n(see Fig. 2). Learning from the Marchand Balun’s [5]\ncommon-mode immunity, this differential design employs\na pair of reactive transmission line components to mitigate\ncommon-modes across a continuous 3:1 impedance band-\nwidth (VSWR < 3) while scanning. In reference to the\naforementioned common-mode mitigation techniques, the\ndipole array with BWIT successfully delivers a resonant-free\nscanning through a simple low-cost PCB printed feed, with\nno added fabrication steps or intentional losses. Simulations\nare verified with measurements of a fabricated 8 × 8 dual-\npolarized prototype. This article is organized as follows.\nSection II presents the design of the dual-polarized array\nwith the novel differential BWIT feed, operating across\n1.05 GHz to 3.2 GHz. Fabrication and measurement details\nare presented in Section III. Section IV gives comparisons\nof the presented array to other recent dipole arrays.\nII. DIFFERENTIALLY FED DIPOLE ARRAY DESIGN\nA. DIFFERENTIAL FEEDING NETWORK\nAs previously noted, several past dipole arrays employed an\nintegrated Marchand balun [5], [20] with the characteristics\nof that in Fig. 2(a). In this article, the dipoles are excited by\nthe BWIT feed network in Fig. 2(b). This feed consists of two\nmicrostrip Marchand baluns arranged in parallel to form one\ndifferential stripline feed structure. As depicted, the BWIT\nemploys a mirrored series open stub ( Z\noc) and a parallel\nshort stub ( Zsc) in each feed line. As with the Marchand\nbalun, these reactive components mitigate the common mode\nwhile scanning. Notably, symmetry between the feed lines\nis maintained and ensures balanced transmission of opposite\nphase signals from the feed to the aperture for all scan angles.\nFinally, a metal via connects the dipole arms on the center\nlayers of the BWIT feed onto the outer layers. Notably, the\nBWIT structure excites the dipoles through a via shorted to\nthe feed’s outer shielding. As with a Marchand balun, the\nBWIT also relies on the “ /Gamma1shaped” feed line to couple\nto the dipoles through its return path, with the open stub\neliminating common modes.\nFor design, the proposed BWIT feed was simulated as\nan infinite array without the dipoles in ANSYS HFSS v.19.\nFig. 3 shows that the BWIT conveys good amplitude and\nphase balance with negligible common-mode influence, even\nwhen scanning down to 60\n◦. At broadside, the simulated\nmaximum amplitude balance was ±0.01 dB with maxi-\nmum phase imbalance of ±1.28 degrees. Further, only small\nphase imbalances are obsereved in the 45 ◦ and 60 ◦ scanning\ncases, and these are attributed to the common mode cou-\npling introduced to the feed branches. However, the BWIT\nstill retains a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR)\n>27 dB (see [23, Fig. 2]). But this is only an imbalance of\n±0.01 dB and maximum phase imbalance < ±1.5\n◦. Further,\nthe average simulated insertion loss was 0.67 dB, 0.86 dB\nand 1.01 dB over the band for the respective broadside, 45 ◦,\nand 60 ◦ scan cases.\nB. DIPOLE ARRAY DESIGN\nThe dipole array operates at two independent linear polariza-\ntions using an egg-crate configuration for ease of assembly\n(see Fig. 1). Also, a metal frequency selective surface (FSS)\nsuperstrate is employed for low-angle scanning with FSS\ndesign considerations, following those outlined in [5], [20].\nIn short, sub-wavelength metallic rectangles are printed\nabove the dipoles as a FSS superstrate. This periodic\nFSS emulates an effective dielectric constant ( ϵ\neff )o ft h e\nimpedance matching as a thick dielectric slab above the\ndipoles. Importantly, that superstrate eliminates the occur-\nrence of trapped waves at deep scan angles (typically > 50\n◦).\nCapacitive overlap sleeves are included to extend impedance\nbandwidth by countering the inductance of the ground plane\nat lower bands [24]. The final design dimensions are given\nin Fig. 1(c) and Table 1.\nC. DIPOLE ARRAY WITH BWIT SIMULATIONS\nInfinite array simulations of the array were performed in\nthe balanced mode, using a pair of differential 50/Omega1lumped\nports, excited with 0 ◦ and 180 ◦ phases [25]. This is denoted\nin Fig. 2(b). The infinite array active VSWR is given\nFig. 4(a). The array provides a broadside VSWR < 3 across\n1.05-3.2 GHz, implying an impedance bandwidth ratio of\n3:1. Likewise, while scanning down to 45\n◦, the array shows\nVSWR < 3 across 1.05-3.2 GHz in the E-plane and D-plane\nand across 1.35-3.2 for the H-plane. Even more, resonant-\nfree VSWR < 3 impedance bandwidth is achieved in the\nE-plane down to 60\n◦.\nAs is the case with other perfect electric conductor\n(PEC) backed dipole arrays, the H-plane scanning VSWR\ndegrades at lower frequencies [5]–[7], [20]. This is primarily\ndue to Floquet mode impedance variations with scan-\nning. Specifically, the 1/cos(θ) term modifies the H-Plane\nimpedance significantly when scanning [26]. Notably, higher\norder multilayer superstrate matching network improves this\nmismatch, but at the expense of array profile and com-\nplexity [6], [27]. The unit cell H-pol to V-pol port-to-port\ncoupling is also given in Fig. 4(b), showing > 30 dB iso-\nlation between the polarizations across all scan angles of\ninterest.\nAfter optimizing the array’s infinite array performance,\nfull-wave semi-finite simulations were performed. These\nresults, which include finite edge and ground plane effects,\nVOLUME 2, 2021 165\nJOHNSON et al.: WIDEBAND DIPOLE ARRAY WITH BALANCED WIDEBAND IMPEDANCE TRANSFORMER (BWIT)\nFIGURE 4.

ARRAY FABRICATION AND MEASUREMENTS\nA. ARRAY PROTOTYPE FABRICATION\nFor validation, an 8×8 array prototype, shown in Fig. 5 was\nfabricated with dimensions as given in Fig. 1(c) and Table 1.\nThe antenna board was constructed from three 0.50 mm (20\nmil) Rogers 5880 ( ϵ\nr = 2.2) laminates, subject to metal tol-\nerance of 0.25 mm (10 mil) and the stackup in Fig. 1. To\nthe best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first differ-\nential array that includes both the feed and superstrates on\nthe vertical antenna cards without added fabrication steps,\nimplying a simple implementation. For ease of assembly,\nnotches were cut into the dielectric board outlines to enable\nan egg-crate arrangement, providing structural stability. No\ndirect electrical connection or soldering was required at the\njoints. The 384mm ×384mm ground board in Fig. 5(a) was\nmilled from four copper-clad 60 mil FR4 board with element\ncutouts. These four sections were combined with copper tape\nat the seams to form a lightweight, structurally stable and\nresonance free ground plane for testing the array. Notably,\nmaterial choices have consequences beyond electrical prop-\nerties. For example, the utilized Rogers 5880 material is of\nexceptional low loss, but is also physically pliable. This can\nFIGURE 5.

Measurement setup employed to characterise balanced S-parameters\nusing the 4-port VNA. Note: For gain measurements, an external Marki Bal-0003 balun\nwas used to translate the differential antenna port to the single-ended measurement\nport.\nlead to adverse effects in polarization purity, as described\nbelow.\nFig. 5(c) shows the feed ports at the bottom side of\nthe ground plane. Notably, the fabricated TCDA houses\n256 connectors to excite each antenna element differ-\nentially (64-element differential pairs per polarization).\nFuture application-specific beamforming feed network can\nbe designed, determined by the space, weight, and power\nneeds of the application. Coaxial cables would likely be\nused to feed into a beamforming network. Depending on\nthe availability of existing amplifiers and switches, a printed\nfeed network with integrated balun could also be considered.\nB. ARRAY MEASUREMENTS\nFor measurement, a 4-port Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)\nwas operated in an internally calibrated differential mode.\nTwo ports (ports 1 and 2) of the VNA were employed to\ncreate an ideal 180\n◦ hybrid coupler to measure the balanced\nS-parameters for each dipole, as shown in Fig. 6. We com-\nputed the active balanced VSWR by adding a linear balanced\n166 VOLUME 2, 2021\nFIGURE 7. Measured active VSWR of an embedded center array element for\n(a) broadside, (b) E-Plane, (c) H-Plane scanning cases with comparisons to\nsimulation, and (d) edge elements measured active VSWR at broadside.\nreflection coefficient Sdd,nn of the embedded center element\nunder test, with a balanced coupling terms Sdd,nm [6]. For\neach measurement, the remaining elements were terminated\nwith 50 /Omega1matched loads.\nThe measured active VSWR of an embedded center ele-\nment is depicted in Fig. 7 as a function of frequency with\ncomparison to simulations. As seen, the measured active\nVSWR yields an 3:1 impedance bandwidth with VSWR < 3\nfrom 1.05 GHz to 3.2 GHz at broadside, in agreement with\nsemi-finite simulations. In fact, a slightly greater impedance\nbandwidth was measured due to ohmic losses and solder-\ning imperfections. Notably, E-plane and H-plane scanning\nVSWR closely follows the infinite array simulated values,\nwith VSWR < 3 across the band. There is a mismatch at\n2 GHz in the H-plane due to fabrication tolerances and a lack\nof mutual coupling versus an infinite array. As previously\nnoted, the degraded impedance matching in the H-plane is\ntypical of this array family [6], [20]. In addition, the effect\nof edge elements on impedance bandwidth is also simulated,\nas shown in Fig. 7(d). The edge elements have a VSWR < 3\nacross 1.76 - 3.4 GHz, though in practice these are typically\nused as matched terminated guard elements.\nFor gain measurements, an external Marki Bal-0003\nbalun [28] was used to translate the differential antenna port\nto the single-ended measurement port. This test component\nwas later de-embedded from the gain measurement. Using\nthis set-up, we measured the embedded center element gain\nof an otherwise match-loaded 8 × 8 dual-polarized array,\ndepicted in Fig. 5. The measured broadside co-polarized and\ncross-polarized gain of an embedded center element is plot-\nted versus frequency in Fig. 8 in comparison to simulations.\nThe array pattern is constructed using the single element\nmeasurements with Ludwig’s 3\nrd definition [29]. These\nFIGURE 8. Measured vs simulated broadside co-polarized and cross-polarized gain\nof the center element as a function of frequency. For comparison with measurements,\nthe simulated case of 1◦ misalignment in φ is also given, along with maximum\nachievable gain.\nFIGURE 9. Measured embedded patterns of the center element in the E,H and\nD-planes for (a) 1 GHz, and (b) 3 GHz. Comparisons to simulation are also given. More\nthan 20 dB polarization purity is achieved out to θ =± 60◦.\nare given in Fig. 9. The measured patterns closely follow\nboth the predicted values and the theoretical 4πAcos(θ)/λ2\ngain, where A is the unit-cell area. Due to the measure-\nment equipment being single-ended, the development of a\nbalun–beamforming network would be required to show the\nradiation patterns of the 8 × 8 finite dual-polarized array.\nInstead, the embedded element pattern is shown, as it is\nwell known to be a good indication of the scan performance\nin a large array [6].\nNotably, the differences between the simulated and mea-\nsured cross-polarized gain levels in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9\nstem from the presence of small physical misalignment’s.\nSpecifically, even a 1\n◦ misalignment can create large dispar-\nities in decibel scales [29]. Here, the 1 ◦ misalignment refers\nVOLUME 2, 2021 167\nJOHNSON et al.: WIDEBAND DIPOLE ARRAY WITH BALANCED WIDEBAND IMPEDANCE TRANSFORMER (BWIT)\nTABLE 2. Comparison of UWB dipole arrays.\nto the position of the fabricated V-pol antenna cards rela-\ntive to the near field chamber’s plane of reference used to\nmeasure the array. Easily, >30 dB disparities can be intro-\nduced [29]. Of course, in simulation the array is perfectly\naligned, and so this effect is not present. For comparisons to\nmeasurements, the simulated case of 1\n◦ misalignment’s in\nφ is also given in Fig. 8. As can be seen, 1 ◦ misalignment\nmeasurement in φ can greatly increase the perceived cross-\npolarized gain values. Even more, extremely small bending\nof the PCB card could also degrade cross-polarized gain\nlevels. the latter is important when choosing a dielectric\nsubstrate.\nIV. BENCHMARKING WIDEBAND DIFFERENTIAL\nDIPOLE ARRAYS\nAs previously mentioned, the main motivation for a wide-\nband differential array with wide angle scanning is the\navailability of new differential RF back ends [2]. To show\nthe benefits of the presented array, we provide a com-\nparison to recent works in Table 2. It is seen that the\npresented array’s performance is well aligned with similar\ndifferentially-fed arrays (about 3:1 VSWR < 3 impedance\nbandwidth ratio). Compared to other works that tackle\ncommon-modes [18], [19], the lack of attenuating resistors\nin this work lead to increased efficiency and simple stan-\ndard PCB fabrication. Also, this boasts the lowest reported\nangle E-plane scanning, more than the previous 45\n◦ or 50◦\nbenchmarks [9], [13].\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe presented a dual-polarized dipole array operating from\nL to S bands ( viz. 1.05 GHz to 3.2 GHz), specifi-\ncally targeting 2G to 5G communications bands. The\npresented novel ultrawideband differential feed, denoted as\nthe Balanced Wideband Impedance Transformer (BWIT),\nremoves common-mode resonances when scanning up to 60\n◦\noff broadside in the E-plane. In reference to past common-\nmode mitigation techniques, the BWIT is unparalleled in\nachieving balanced feeding on low-cost PCB, with no added\nfabrication steps or losses. Trade-offs between performance,\nmaterial choice, and antenna profile were discussed. Most\nimportantly, an 8 × 8 differential array was fabricated\nand measured, with measurements showing agreement to\nsimulations.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Radio Spectrum Allocation . Accessed: Feb. 24, 2020.
