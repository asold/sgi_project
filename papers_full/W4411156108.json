NRSs are algorithms that provide personalized news content based on \nusers’ interests and reading habits. These systems work using a variety of techniques, \nincluding content-based filtering CB recommending items based on the features of \nthe items themselves and a user's past preferences (Symeonidis, Chaltsev, et al., \n2021), collaborative filtering CF, recommending items based on the preferences of \nsimilar users or the similarity between items (Han, 2024), and deep learning (Karimi \net al., 2018). In recent years, deep learning -based models have made great progress \nin NRS (Mahesh et al., 2022). Additionally, integrating editorial feedback into \nrecommendation systems is an important step toward improving the accuracy and \nquality of news (Mahmood et al., 2024).  \n \nThe rapid evolution of AI technologies, especially LLMs, provides features that can \nprovide significant breakthroughs in this field by making systems better understand \nuser behavior, news content semantics, and context (Amir et al., 2023). LLMs are AI \nmodels trained on large amounts of text data to perform natural language processing \n(NLP) tasks. These models excel at tasks, such as text generation, summarization, \ntranslation, and question -answering (Pahune & Chandrasekharan, 2023). \nDevelopments in LLMs and  NLPs have significantly enhanced the accuracy and \nefficiency of digital news platforms in providing personalized news suggestions. \n \nIn spite of this progress, new problems can arise with new technologies while some \nchallenge in the field continues. Previous approaches, such as CF and CB often \nstruggled with problems, such as cold-start problem, which refers toa difficulty that \noccurs in recommendation systems when there is not enough data about new users \nor new products, preventing the system from making accurate predictions and \nreducing the quality of recommendations (Moghaddam & Elahi, 2019). Another \nissue is the risk of filter bubble s where personalized algorithms showing content \naligned with users' interests. This limits exposure to different perspectives and \nreduces information diversity (Flaxman et al., 2016). Although hybrid systems offer \nimprovements regarding some of these probl ems, the dynamic structure of user \ninterest and the complexity of news data requires more sophisticated methods. The \nlatest developments in LLMs, such as Bert and GPT models offer new opportunities \nC. Kazanc, N. Taşkın: Advancements in News Recommendation Systems: The Role and Impact of \nArtificial Intelligence and Large Language Models 679 \n \n \nby improving their semantic understanding and contextual suggestion skills (Zhang \net al., 2021). However, calculation costs and sustainability concerns show that more \nresearch is needed. \n \nThe motivation for this study stems from the gap in understanding the full scope of \nAI on NRS, especially the role of LLMs. While the existing investigations provide \nvaluable insights (Raza & Ding, 2022) on previous methods, such as CB, CF, hybrid \napproaches, and deep learning -based models, the effects of the latest LLM and \nGenerative AI progress are omitted (Amir et al., 2023) with the rapid development \nof these technologies. While some previous studies (Hou et al., 2023) have addressed \nthe impact of LLMs and Generative AI, a study conducted after the development of \nthese technologies will better explain and compare current methods Although \nprevious studies (Zhang et al., 2021) examined the impact of LLMs and generative \nAI, further research conducted following recent advancements in these technologies \nis needed to better understand and comparatively evaluate current methods. This \nstudy addresses this gap by systematically examining the integration of AI and LLMs \ninto NRS, focusing on system performance, user  personalization and contribution \nto contextual understanding. \n \nTo guide this exploration, the study addresses two central research questions: \n \n1. What are the approaches used in news recommendation systems (NRS) in the \nliterature after the development of large language models (LLMs), and what are their \nadvantages, limitations, and the role of artificial intelligence in these approaches? \n \n2. How have LLMs influenced the development and performance of NRS? \n \nBy systematically analyzing the 42 studies published after 2021, this research aims to \nprovide a comprehensive understanding of progress, difficulties and future aspects \nin the field and to provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners. \n \n2 Methodology \n \nThis study uses the PRISMA guidelines to systematically review the existing \nliterature on the integration of NRSs with AI and LLM (Moher et al., 2009). The \nPRISMA guidelines provide rigorous and transparent framework for identifying, \n680 38TH BLED ECONFERENCE: \nEMPOWERING TRANSFORMATION: SHAPING DIGITAL FUTURES FOR ALL \n \n \nscreening, and selecting studies relevant to the research questions, ensuring the \nreliability and reproducibility of the review process. \n \nTo collect relevant studies, we conducted a comprehensive search of two academic \ndatabases, Web of Science and Scopus, due to their worldwide importance \n(Mongeon & Paul-Hus, 2016). In the search, we used the following query strings to \ncapture a wide range of research in the field: \n \n\"news recommendation\" and \"artificial intelligence\", \"news personalization\" and \n\"artificial intelligence\", \"news recommendation\" and \"large language models\", \"news \npersonalization\" and \"large language models\". \n \nThis search yielded a total of 129 studies. Of these, 23 were eliminated due to \nduplicate records, leaving 106 studies for further evaluation. We excluded 42 studies \nconducted before 2021, since the release of ChatGPT -3.5 that year has irrevocably \nchanged the landscape of AI -based recommendation systems (Myers et al., 2024) . \nThe rationale for this decision was to be able to investigate the impact of LLMs and \nAI on NRS methods with these revolutionary developments in AI technology. We \nthen screened each study based on the availability of title, abstract, and full text to \ndetermine its relevance to the research questions. Studies that were unrelated to the \nrole of AI or LLMs in NRS or did not have full-text access were excluded, resulting \nin the elimination of  22 studies. Details can be examined on the flow diagram in \nFigure 1 (see Appendix A). \n \nConsidering that content-based, collaborative and hybrid filtering are definitions that \nhave been used long without AI technologies (Aboutorab et al., 2023), we have \nexplained the advantages and limitations of models that are based on AI and can be \nused with AI in Tables 1, 3, 5, and 6. Although the studies on the subject are limited \nfor now, we meticulously compiled the information about the use of LLMs in NRSs \nin the existing literature. The last part included the results by interpreting the impact \nof AI on NRSs, the comparison of AI approaches, the impact of LLMs and their \nfuture according to the inferences we made from the literature.  \n \nThe final selection included 42 studies that met the inclusion criteria. We analyzed \nthese studies to address the research questions and focused on the impact of AI on \nNRS and the impact of LLMs on their development and performance. Through this \nC. Kazanc, N. Taşkın: Advancements in News Recommendation Systems: The Role and Impact of \nArtificial Intelligence and Large Language Models 681 \n \n \nprocess, we aimed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased review of the latest \ndevelopments in the field. \n \n3 Common Approaches in News Recommendation Systems \n \n3.1 Collaborative Filtering \n \nCollaborative filtering (CF) is a recommendation system that analyzes user behavior \nand makes predictions about possible future behaviors of users (Shichang, 2021). \nCF methods are based on the idea that users who have made similar choices in the \npast will make similar choices in the future (Feng & Lv(U), 2022). \n \nWe can examine CF models under two headings: User -Based CF identifies users \nwith similar tastes and recommends items that these users have liked in the past to \nothers (Ludwig et al., 2023). For example, if user 1 and user 2 both showed interest \nin news x and y, the system predicts that these users' preferences are similar. If user \n1 shows interest in news z, the system recommends news z to user 2 (X. Liu, 2022). \nItem-Based CF focuses on similarities between items and recommends items that \nare similar to items the user has liked before (Ludwig et al., 2023). For example, if a \nuser is reading a news article, the recommendation system shows related articles in \na news feed component (Lucas & de Figueiredo, 2023). \n \nAlthough CF is one of the most prominent methods used by sources, such as Google \nNews among NRSs, it inherently suffers from a cold -start problem when it comes \nto new users and new items (Lv et al., 2024). To overcome such difficulties, hybrid \napproaches are preferred by using models such as CB (Zhu et al., 2022) and session-\nbased (Pourashraf & Mobasher, 2023).  \n \n3.2 Content-Based Filtering \n \nContent-based (CB) NRSs use the content of news articles to make \nrecommendations (Fieiras-Ceide et al., 2023). These systems analyze features, such \nas news topics or content and suggest news similar to what the user has previously \nbeen interested in (Ludwi g et al., 2023). CB methods are widely used in news \nrecommendations because users usually do not have long-term profiles on news sites \n(Alam et al., 2022). \n682 38TH BLED ECONFERENCE: \nEMPOWERING TRANSFORMATION: SHAPING DIGITAL FUTURES FOR ALL \n \n \nCB NRSs represent news articles using feature vectors (Ludwig et al., 2023), which \ncan include information like topics discussed in an article, the news outlet that \npublished it, or other relevant metadata (Manh Nguyen et al., 2022). Similarity \ncalculation in CB calculates the similarity between news articles based on their \nfeature vectors (Alam et al., 2022). Term frequency -inverse document frequency \n(TF-IDF) is the most widely used method for numerically representing text. This \ntechnique converts the similarities between news items into values between 0 and 1 \nusing cosine similarity, allowing for accurate recommendations (Ludwig et al., 2023). \n \nCB methods build user profiles based on their past interactions with news articles. \nThese profiles represent a user's interests and preferences (Lv et al., 2024). They do \nnot rely on the behavior of other users (Ludwig et al., 2023). They expand user \nprofiles using personal information and address the cold -start problem (J. Yang et \nal., 2023). With these features, they are useful at utilizing the rich textual content of \nnews articles (Fu, 2023).  \n \nSince CB systems tend to show users news that is similar to news they have seen \nbefore, there is a possibility that they will present the same or very similar news to \nthe reader again (Ludwig et al., 2023). These systems can increase the risk of locking \nusers into “filter bubbles” by focusing on similar content, where users are constantly \npresented with news that is similar to their preferences or to news they have \npreviously engaged with, potentially isolating users from different perspectives (Sun \net al., 2021; Vrijenhoek, 2023). Some CF algorithms use only news headlines as input, \nand headlines often carry a significant bias (Ruan et al., 2023). In order overcome \nthe problems in these systems or to reduce their effects, CB systems are used \ntogether with systems, such as CF to form Hybrid Systems (Q. Zhao et al., 2024). \n \n3.3 Hybrid Systems \n \nHybrid NRSs combine different approaches to improve the accuracy and \neffectiveness of recommendations (Manh Nguyen et al., 2022). Besides demographic \nand knowledge-based filtering models, which are beyond the scope of this article as \nthey do not rely on AI (Ludwig et al., 2023), hybrid systems combining models like \nCB and CF aim to overcome limitations of single -model approaches (Song et al., \n2021). \nC. Kazanc, N. Taşkın: Advancements in News Recommendation Systems: The Role and Impact of \nArtificial Intelligence and Large Language Models 683 \n \n \nCommon hybrid approaches and techniques include CB and CF combining user \nprofiles, news content, and user behavior gives recommendations based on user’s \ninterests and past actions (Manh Nguyen et al., 2022). Hybrid Deep Learning Models \nutilize neural netwo rks to integrate content and user data. For example, ACCM \n(2018) uses Cold-Sampling strategy that can recommend items even if the user or \nitem is new to the system (Shi et al., 2021). Multi- faceted Hybrid Systems combine \ncontent, CF and knowledge graphs (X u & Gu, 2022). Similarly, Multi -Objective \nApproaches consider multiple objectives, such as accuracy and diversity, in their \nrecommendations (M. Zhao et al., 2023). \n \nHybrid systems overcome the cold -start problem, increase diversity (Ludwig et al., \n2023), accuracy (X. Liu, 2022) and stability (Song et al., 2021). Additionally, they \nprovide a better user experience (Cui et al., 2021), reduce information overload (X. \nLiu, 2022), and create more robust systems (Shi et al., 2021). \n \n4 Ai Driven Techniques in News Recommendation Systems \n \n4.1 Session-Based Systems \n \nSession-based NRSs focus on providing recommendations based on a user’s current, \nshort-term interactions with the news platform, rather than relying on long -term \nuser profiles (Symeonidis, Chaltsev, et al., 2021). These systems are particularly \neffective in the news domain, as users' interests vary on a session -by-session basis \nand most users are anonymous (Lucas & de Figueiredo, 2023). \n \nSession-based systems analyze the sequence of articles users interact with, in a single \nsession to understand their immediate interests (Sheu et al., 2022). A session is \ndefined as a series of interactions within a short time (Symeonidis, Kirjackaja, et al., \n2021). These systems aim to capture short -term user preferences, as opposed to \nlong-term interests (Sheu et al., 2022), as user interests can change quickly \n(Pourashraf & Mobasher, 2023).  \n \nSession-based methods can effectively deal with anonymous users since they do not \nrequire past user history or profiles (Lucas & de Figueiredo, 2023). The sequential \norder of articles viewed within a session plays a crucial role, as click order provides \nvaluable insights into users’ evolving interests within a given session (Sheu et al., \n684 38TH BLED ECONFERENCE: \nEMPOWERING TRANSFORMATION: SHAPING DIGITAL FUTURES FOR ALL \n \n \n2022). Some advanced models consider both intra -session element transitions and \ninter-session transitions to address the problem of insufficient information at the \nbeginning of the session (Symeonidis, Chaltsev, et al., 2021). Table 1 briefly \noverviews session-based systems, highlighting their strength in capturing short-term \nbehavior and limitation in reflecting long-term preferences(see Appendix B) . \n \n4.2 Graph-Based Systems \n \nGraph-based systems for news recommendation leverage the relationships between \ndifferent entities, such as users, news articles, topics, to improve the accuracy and \nrelevance of recommendations (Li et al., 2023). In other words, these systems can \nwork with other recommendation systems that keep users, content, products(items), \netc. in the form of graphics and control their relationships with each other (Sheu et \nal., 2022).  \n \nTable 2 provides a concise overview of various graph -based approaches currently \nemployed in NRS, emphasizing how each leverages AI to capture and analyze \nrelationships among entities. It highlights key characteristics and research insights, \nillustrating both their contributions and limitations within the domain (see Appendix \nC). \n \nTable 3 provides a summary of the advantages and limitations of graph- based \nsystems in news recommendation, highlighting their effectiveness in modeling \nrelationships and their key challenges, such as computational complexity and \nscalability (Li et al., 2023) (see Appendix D). \n \n4.3 Deep Learning Based Systems \n \nDeep learning (DL) algorithms work in a way similar to the way the human brain \nworks and can automatically be trained with large amounts of data to produce high-\nquality semantic inferences. Thanks to their ability to be trained continuously, they \ncan optimize their recommendations up to date (Han, 2024). While DL -based \nmethods have shown their effectiveness in different domains, such as image \nrecognition and NLP, extensive experiments have been conducted in NRSs (Lim et \nal., 2022).  \nC. Kazanc, N. Taşkın: Advancements in News Recommendation Systems: The Role and Impact of \nArtificial Intelligence and Large Language Models 685 \n \n \nThe approaches summarized in Table 4 represent significant advancements in \napplying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) within NRS. These methods utilize AI's \ncapability to handle complex user interactions, semantic contexts, and sequential \ndata, directly addressi ng challenges such as data sparsity and personalization (see \nAppendix E). This aligns with the research questions by highlighting how various \nDNN architectures, including CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and attention \nmechanisms, influence the performance and development of NRS, particularly in \nthe context of recent advancements in AI and LLMs. \n \nTable 5 summarizes the advantages and limitations of deep learning -based systems \nin NRS, emphasizing their strengths in modeling complex user interactions, \nsemantic understanding, and addressing sparsity, but also highlighting their \nchallenges, such as computational complexity and data requirements (see Appendix \nF). \n \n4.4 Multi-Interest Based Systems \n \nInstead of single-interest models in NRSs, multi -interest based models that aim to \ncapture diverse and varied interests of users, overcome the limitations of single -\ninterest based models (P. Zhao et al., 2023). These systems observe that users \ngenerally have multiple areas of interest that can change over time (Hou et al., 2023). \nInstead of fitting a user's interests into a single mold, multi-interest systems attempt \nto create several different interest profiles for each user (P. Zhao et al., 2023). \n \nMulti-interest systems learn multiple representation vectors for each user, with each \nvector representing a different interest (Hou et al., 2023). Some models create \ninterest prototypes that serve as the basis for learning multiple user representations. \nThese prototypes may reflect different topics or interests (S. Wang et al., 2023). \nMulti-head self-attention models can be used to detect potential interest areas in \neach clicked news. Each title vector represents an interest area (R. Wang et al., 2022).  \n \nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are used to model user interests using information \ncollected from user neighbors in a user -news graph. Some models leverage \npersonalized graphs to capture more nuanced relationships between user behaviors \n(Wu et al., 2021). GNN s can also be used to improve user representations by \n686 38TH BLED ECONFERENCE: \nEMPOWERING TRANSFORMATION: SHAPING DIGITAL FUTURES FOR ALL \n \n \nevaluating the relationships between users and news on graphs containing different \ntypes of nodes and relationships (S. Wang et al., 2023). \n \nMulti-channel information fusion involves modeling user interests and capturing \ndiversity by combining news content from different sources, at different levels of \ndetail, and using different types of information, such as text and assets (Z. Yang et \nal., 2023). \n \nAs shown in Table 6, multi- interest models capture diverse, multi- grained user \npreferences, from low-level keywords to high-level topics, and track both short- and \nlong-term dynamics to enhance recommendation accuracy and adaptability. \nHowever, as detailed  in Table 6, they may misinterpret curiosity -driven clicks, \nintroduce noise and redundancy when the number of interests grows, and \noversimplify news by overlooking key events and stylistic nuances  (see Appendix \nG). \n \n4.5 LLMs In NRSs \n \nDespite the limited research on the topic, important insights have emerged from the \nuse of LLMs particularly models like BERT and other PLMs in NRSs. \n \nBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained \nlanguage model (PLM) that can capture contextual information and semantic \nmeaning of words. BERT-based models improve the understanding of news content \nby learning richer semantic information (Hou et al., 2023). It is used to initialize the \nword-level module of some news recommendation models and enables the \ndevelopment of textual representations. It further helps to alleviate the cold -start \nproblem by taking advantage of rich g rammar. Pre-trained models like BERT are \nused to create contextual word embeddings. These embeddings help models capture \nthe meaning of words based on how they are used in a sentence (Zhang et al., 2021). \n \nUsing BERT or other PLMs such as RoBERTa and GPT often leads to significant \nperformance improvements in NRSs (S. Wang et al., 2023). For example, one study \nshowed that a model using BERT outperformed other models, with a 2.81% \nimprovement in AUC (area under the curve) on a large dataset (Zhang et al., 2021). \nC. Kazanc, N. Taşkın: Advancements in News Recommendation Systems: The Role and Impact of \nArtificial Intelligence and Large Language Models 687 \n \n \nAlthough PLMs are effective, they often require high computational resources. \nTraditional end-to-end training paradigms also face efficiency challenges, particularly \ndue to the repeated encoding of the same news content. To address this, Q. Liu et \nal. (2024) introduced the OLEO (Only -Encode-Once) paradigm, which involves \npre-training the content encoder before integrating it into the model. This approach \nhas shown comparable accuracy while significantly improving sustainability metrics \nby up to 2992% compar ed to state -of-the-art end-to-end methods. (Q. Liu et al., \n2024). Beyond BERT, transformer-based models like ELECTRA are also being used \nfor pre-training text encoders as discriminators rather than generators (J. Yang et al., \n2023). This shift in pre -training strategy offers a more sample -efficient alternative, \nwhich could further reduce computational costs while maintaining or even \nimproving model performance in NRSs. \n \n5 Discussion \n \nThis research aims to examine the impact and applications of AI, and especially \nLLMs, on NRSs. The findings show that AI -driven approaches provide improved \nresults in personalization, accuracy, and efficiency compared to traditional methods. \nHowever, challenges such as bias, filter bubbles, and computational costs remain for \nsome methods. \n \n5.1 The Impact of AI \n \nWith the advancement in AI, significant advances have been made in NRSs by \ndeveloping personalized experiences tailored to individual user preferences. CF, \nwhich we also encounter in traditional approaches, effectively uses user behavior \npatterns to predic t future interests, although it has a cold -start problem. CB \nsignificantly prevents the cold-start problem by analyzing news content, but it carries \nthe risk of creating filter bubbles because it constantly recommends similar content. \nSimilarly, Flaxman et al. (2016) note that CB often narrows exposure by reinforcing \nuser biases, contributing to the filter bubble effect. Hybrid systems combining CF \nand CB significantly eliminate these limitations by taking advantage of both user \nbehavior and content similar ity. X. Liu (2022) also supports that by emphasizing \nhow hybrid models outperform single approaches in terms of accuracy and diversity. \nSession-based systems, which focus on short- term interactions, make effective \nrecommendations to anonymous users and dynamic interests, and demonstrate the \n688 38TH BLED ECONFERENCE: \nEMPOWERING TRANSFORMATION: SHAPING DIGITAL FUTURES FOR ALL \n \n \nability to adapt to real -time user behavior thanks to AI -supported systems. \nSymeonidis et al. (2023) also highlight the value of session -based models in \naddressing the transient nature of user interests in news domains. Graph -based \nsystems and deep learnin g-based systems allow complex understanding of user \npreferences and news content connections by using complex relationships between \nentities together with traditional methods. Li et al. (2023) and W. Liu et al. (2024) \nsimilarly show that graph -based method s capture higher -order interactions, \nimproving recommendation precision. \n \n5.2 Comparing AI-driven Tecniques \n \nEach AI-based NRS we mentioned has its own strengths and weaknesses. While CF \nis very successful in capturing the behavior of users by grouping them, it struggles \nwhen dealing with new users and items. While CB overcomes these problems with \nits content -focused approach, it fails to direct users to new interests, constantly \nrecommending similar content. Hybrid systems aim to overcome these problems by \nusing the strengths of both. While session -based systems address the dynamic \nstructure of the news domain, g raph-based methods exploit complex relationships \nto provide more sophisticated recommendations. Deep learning models, such as \nCNNs, RNNs, and attention networks are powerful tools to analyze complex data \nand provide more accurate and personalized recommend ations when used in \nconjunction with other methods. Multi -interest-based systems increase the \nperformance in personalization by capturing different interests of users. The \nselection of the most appropriate method depends on the requirements and data \ncharacteristics. \n \n5.3 The Influence of LLMs \n \nAlthough there are few studies on the use of LLMs in NRSs, we can say that LLM \nmodels, such as BERT have started a new era with the performance increase, they \nbring in news recommender systems as well as in many other areas. When we look \nat CB models befor e LLMs, LLMs that capture contextual information and \nmeanings provide a more detailed understanding of news content compared to \nmodels that measure the frequency of words used. In this way, the increase in \nrecommendation accuracy has been proven numerically by the studies (Zhang et al., \n2021). However, when it comes to cost and sustainability, the use of LLMs in NRSs \nC. Kazanc, N. Taşkın: Advancements in News Recommendation Systems: The Role and Impact of \nArtificial Intelligence and Large Language Models 689 \n \n \ncan be a source of concern. LLMs have become more competitive in terms of cost \nand sustainability with innovative approaches such as the OLEO paradigm. Recent \nframeworks like OLEO aim to address these concerns, aligning with Hou et al. \n(2023) who suggest lightweight multi -head attention as a viable cost- efficient \nalternative. \n \n5.4 The Future of LLMs in News Recommendation \n \nThe potential of LLMs in developing NRSs cannot be underestimated. Future \nresearch should explore more efficient training paradigms by focusing on reducing \ncosts to increase sustainability. Hybrid use of LLMs with other recommender system \nmethods should al so be tried to optimize costs. Combining LLMs with session-\nbased models can help capture the dynamic nature of news and improve accuracy, \nwhile using them with multi- interest models may help personalize content and \nintroduce users to new topics. In addition to CB methods, using LLMs together with \nCF methods, especially with item -based CF methods, is a promising method for \ndeveloping recommendation systems with semantic similarities of news, and \nreducing costs. \n \n5.5 Limitations \n \nThe study is not without limitations. First of all, since this review focused on AI -\ndriven methods, it ignored studies that examined the possible contributions of other \napproaches. Although the focus was on recent studies, the rapid development of the \nfield under investigation means that new techniques can emerge rapidly, and \npotentially some findings can quickly become outdated. Additionally, the inclusion \ncriteria limited the scope to studies published after 2021, which may have excluded \nfoundational work s or earlier influential models still relevant today. Another \nlimitation is the variation in evaluation metrics and datasets used across studies, \nwhich makes it difficult to directly compare the performance of different models. \nFinally, the review emphasiz es technical and performance -based aspects, while \nsocio-ethical implications, such as user trust, transparency, and fairness in AI-driven \nnews recommendation received limited attention. \n  \n690 38TH BLED ECONFERENCE: \nEMPOWERING TRANSFORMATION: SHAPING DIGITAL FUTURES FOR ALL \n \n \n6 Conclusion \n \nThis study highlights the role of AI and LLMs in the development of NRSs. AI has \nbeen effective in improving personalization, scalability, and contextual \nunderstanding with hybrid, graph-based, and deep-learning approaches that address \nlimitations such as cold -start problems and data sparsity. Although LLMs such as \nBERT offer new paradigms for efficiency and sustainability by further improving \nsemantic analysis and recommendation accuracy, more observations are needed as \nthese developments are still very recent. \n \nDespite these developments, challenges remain in terms of computational efficiency, \nethical issues, and maintaining diversity in recommendations. Future efforts should \nfocus on energy -efficient systems, cost reduction, sustainability, and integrating \nmultimodal data such as textual, visual, and behavioral. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAboutorab, H., Hussain, O.
