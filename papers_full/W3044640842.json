    "full_text": "SyntaLinker: automatic fragment linking with deep\nconditional transformer neural networks†\nYuyao Yang, ‡ab Shuangjia Zheng,‡a Shimin Su,ab Chao Zhao,a Jun Xu *a\nand Hongming Chen*b\nLinking fragments to generate a focused compound library for a speciﬁc drug target is one of the challenges\nin fragment-based drug design (FBDD). Hereby, we propose a new program named SyntaLinker, which is\nbased on a syntactic pattern recognition approach using deep conditional transformer neural networks.\nThis state-of-the-art transformer can link molecular fragments automatically by learning from the\nknowledge of structures in medicinal chemistry databases ( e.g. ChEMBL database). Conventionally,\nlinking molecular fragments was viewed as connecting substructures that were predeﬁned by empirical\nrules. In SyntaLinker, however, the rules of linking fragments can be learned implicitly from known\nchemical structures by recognizing syntactic patterns embedded in SMILES notations. With deep\nconditional transformer neural networks, SyntaLinker can generate molecular structures based on\na given pair of fragments and additional restrictions. Case studies have demonstrated the advantages and\nusefulness of SyntaLinker in FBDD.\nIntroduction\nOver the past two decades, the fast development of gene\nsequencing technologies, together with high-throughput\nscreening1 (HTS) and combinatorial chemistry 2 for library\nsynthesis, has largely changed the drug discovery paradigm\nfrom a phenotypic centric approach to a target centric\napproach.\n3,4 Lead identi cation by screening a large\ncompound collection has become a standard exercise among\nlarge pharmaceutical companies.\n5 Despite its success in drug\ndiscovery, the high cost for maintaining the large compound\ncollection and launching a screening campaign is a big hurdle\nfor drug developers in academics and small biotech compa-\nnies.\n6 Also, there are many factors inuencing the quality of\nH T Sh i t ss u c ha st e c h n o l o g yh i t t e r ,s a m p l ep u r i t y ,a n ds a m p l e\naggregation.\n7,8\nIn recent years, fragment-based drug design (FBDD) has\ngained considerable attention as an alternative drug discovery\nstrategy due to its lower cost in running the assay and potential\nadvantages in identifying hits for di ﬃcult targets.\n9–11 The\nconcept of FBDD dates back to the pioneering work of William\nJencks in the mid-1990s.12 It usually starts from screening low\nmolecular weight molecules (for example, MW < 300 daltons;\nbinding aﬃnity of the order of mM), which have weak, but\neﬃcient interactions against a target protein.\n13 The fragment\nscreening is usually carried out at high concentration and\na typical fragment collection is around a few thousands of\ncompounds in contrast to millions of compounds in HTS.\n14 The\neﬀective use of fragments as starting points for step-wise opti-\nmization has shown capability to overcome the major obstacles\nfor further drug development, such as limited chemical space,\nlow structural diversity, and unfavourable drug absorption,\ndistribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET)\nproperties.\n15 Therefore, the popularity of fragment-based drug\ndesign has grown at a remarkable rate in both industry and\nacademic institutions.16\nThere are two key factors for successfully utilizing FBDD in\ndrug discovery: (i)nding suitable fragments (ii) growing and\noptimizing these fragments to develop lead-like molecules.\nMany experimental and computational eﬀorts for nding the\nfragments have been developed in the past decade,\n17 such as\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography,\nsurface plasmon resonance (SPR) and virtual screening.\n18\nFragment growing, merging, and linking are three main tech-\nniques to convert fragments to leads.\n19–22 Linking fragments is\nstill challenging because it is diﬃcult to retain the binding\nmodes of the fragments aer the linking. Thus, linking frag-\nments is a key problem to be resolved to improve the ligand\neﬃciency of the fragments.\n23–25 Conventional fragment linking\ntechniques26 are database search27,28 and quantum mechanical\n(QM) calculations (such as fragment molecular orbital\naResearch Center for Drug Discovery, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen\nUniversity, 132 East Circle at University City, Guangzhou 510006, China.

Recently, Imrie and co-workers reported a fragment\nlinking technique with a generative model\n47 (aka DeLinker),\nwhich can link fragments while keeping the relative positions of\nthe fragments intact.\nIn the current study, we propose a new technique (aka Syn-\ntaLinker) for fragment linking. The algorithm works by recog-\nnizing syntactic patterns embedded in the SMILES\nrepresentation. Inspired by the machine translation task in\nnatural language processing (NLP), we regard the fragment\nlinking as an NLP-like task (sentence completion\n48), and\ndevelop a new conditional transformer architecture (Synta-\nLinker) for linker generation in a controllable manner. In the\ncurrent study, we divide ChEMBL compounds into terminal\nfragments and linkers, which are used to train our transformer\nmodels to learn syntactic patterns for linking fragments. Thus,\nit is unnecessary to use any rigid transformation rule.\nOur model takes terminal fragments and linker constraints,\nsuch as the shortest linker bond distance (SLBD), the existence\nof the hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen bond acceptor, rotatable\nbond and ring etc., as the input and generates product\ncompounds containing input fragments. Compared to DeLin-\nker, our approach achieved higher recovery rate in terms of\nrational linker prediction. Finally, through a few case studies,\nwe demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our approach on some\ncommon drug design tasks such as fragment linking, lead\noptimization and scaﬀold hopping.\nMethods\nTask denition\nOur goal is to generate lead-like molecules by connecting pairs\nof fragments with constraints to the linker as shown in Fig. 1.\nThere are two types of linking constraints used as control\ncodes during training. One is the SLBD between two anchor\npoints, which are used to maintain the relative position of a pair\nof fragments. The other one is the constraint with multiple\nfeatures, such as the presence (1) or absence (0) of hydrogen\nbond donors (HBDs), hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs), rotat-\nable bonds (RBs) and rings, which can be regarded as additional\npharmacophoric constraints.\nThis process can be regarded as an end-to-end sentence\ncompletion process, where a pair of fragments is the input signal\nand the full compound is the output signal. Schwalleret al.\n49 used\nencoder–decoder neural network architecture to predict reaction\nproducts in an end-to-end manner, where the reactants serve as\nthe source sequence and the reaction product as the target\nsequence, whereas in our case, a pair of fragments and the\nconstraints of the SLBD (as a prepended token) are dened as the\nsource sequence, and the full molecule as the target sequence.\nExamples of the sequence expression are shown in Fig. 1. A\ntraining example with SLBD as the constraint is described as\n“[L_4]c1ccccc1[*].[*]C1CCOCC1 [ c1ccc(CNCC2CCOCC2)cc1”,\nwhere “[L_4]c1ccccc1[*].[*]C1CCOCC1” is the source sequence,\n“c1ccc(CNCC2CCOCC2)cc1” is the target sequence, and“[L_4]” is\nthe SLBD (equal to four bond distance) as the control code. In the\nother example,“[ L _ 41110 ]” represents the multiple constraints,\nwhere “1110 ” represents the presence of HBD, HBA, RB and the\nabsence of a ring.\nThroughout the study, SLBD only and SLBD plus multiple\npharmacophore constraint model are named SyntaLinker and\nSyntaLinker_multi model respectively. Additionally, a reference\nmodel without using any constraint, SyntaLinker_n, was also\ntrained for comparison.\nModel architecture\nA novel conditional generative model (SyntaLinker) with trans-\nformer architecture is proposed to generate molecular struc-\ntures with user-de ned conditions. Compared to the\nconventional transformer model,\n50 SyntaLinker (Fig. 2) intro-\nduces prepended control codes51,52 to the generated molecules\ncomplying with the user-dened criterion.\nAll source and target sequences of our data set wererst\ntokenized to construct a vocabulary. For each example sequence\ncontaining n tokens, where a token is referred to as an indi-\nvidual letter of the SMILES string, it was rst encoded into\na one-hot matrix by the vocabulary and then transformed into\nan embedding matrix M\ns ¼ (e1, ., en) by a word embedding\nalgorithm53 as we did in our previous work.54 Ms was composed\nof n corresponding vectors in Rd, where d is the embedding\ndimension.\nThe core architecture of SyntaLinker consists of multiple\nencoder–decoder stacks. The encoder and decoder consist of six\nidentical layers. Each encoder layer has a multi-head self-\nattention sub-layer and a position-wise feedforward network\n(FFN) sub-layer. A multi-head attention consists of several\nscaled dot-product attention functions running in parallel and\nconcatenates their outputs intonal values, which allows the\nmodel to focus on information from diﬀerent subspaces at\ndiﬀerent positions. An attention mechanism computes the dot\nproducts of the query (Q) with all keys (K), introduces a scaling\nfactor d\nk (equal to the size of weight matrices) to avoid excessive\ndot products, and then applies a somax function to obtain the\nweights on the values (V).

Each decoder layer has three sub-layers, including\ntwo attention sub-layer and an FFN sub-layer. The decoder\nself-attention sub-layer uses a mask to preclude attending to\nfuture tokens, while the encoder–decoder attention sub-layer\nhelps the decoder to focus on important characters in the\nsource sequence, and capture the relationship between the\nencoder and decoder.\nFor a given source sequence, its input embedding is pro-\ncessed by encoder layers into a latent representationL ¼ (l\n1, .,\nln). Given L, the decoder output is normalized with a somax\nfunction, yielding a probability distribution for sampling\na token, and then generates an output sequenceY ¼ y\n1, ., ym of\none token at a time until the ending token“h/si” is generated.\nFinally, the cross-entropy loss between the target sequenceMt ¼\n(e1, ., ek) and the output sequence Y is minimized during\ntraining.\nL ðY; MÞ¼/C0\nXk\ni¼1\nyi log mi (2)\nData preparation\nOur data were derived from the ChEMBL59 database and pre-\nprocessed in the same way as our previous study35 did, then\nltered with Lipinski's“Rules of Five”,60 pan assay interference\ncompounds7 (PAINS) substructures and, synthetic accessibility\nscore61 (SAscore, the cut-oﬀ value set to 6.5) to guarantee that\nthe generated molecules are lead-like and likely to be\nsynthesizable.\nTo mimic the fragment linking scenario, we constructed the\ndata set using the matched molecular pairs (MMPs) cutting\nalgorithm\n62 proposed by Hussain et al. Firstly, each molecule\nwas deconstructed using the MMPs cutting algorithm, which\nexecuted double cuts of non-functional groups, acyclic single\nbonds in every compound and this will transform the\ncompound into a quadruple form like “fragment 1, linker,\nfragment 2, molecule”, which corresponds to the two terminal\nfragments, a linker and the original compound. In total\n5 873 503 fragment molecule quadruples (FMQs) were\nenumerated; secondly, the FMQs were further ltered using\n“Rule of three”\n63 criteria, i.e. an FMQ will be removed if any of its\nterminal fragment violates the“Rule of three” criteria; consid-\nering that the requirement of linking fragments in reality is to\nconnect two close fragments using a linker as simple as\nFig. 2 Flow-chart of the SyntaLinker conditional transformer neural network architecture.

In our experience,\napplying these lters does help the generation of lead-like\nmolecules.\nSAscore_filter ¼\n8\n<\n:\nSA\nfragment 1 \\5\nSAfragment 2 \\5\nSAlinker \\\n/C0\nSAfragment 1 þ SAfragment 2\n/C1 (3)\nIn the end, only terminal fragments and original\ncompounds were kept as the fragment molecule triplet (FMT)\nfor model training and all chemical structures in the FMTs\nwere transformed to the canonicalized SMILES format\n46,64 with\nRDKit.65\nOur ChEMBL data set was further divided into three sets with\na ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 for training, validating, and testing, respec-\ntively. All FMTs were grouped by the corresponding SLBD.\nWhen splitting the ChEMBL set into those three sets, a random\nsampling strategy was adopted to make sure the distribution of\nSLBD is similar among all three sets.\nIn addition, for further evaluating the generalization capa-\nbility of our model, we also considered an external validation set\nderived from the CASF-2016 data set,\n66 which consists of 285\nprotein–ligand complexes with high-quality crystal structures.\nMoreover, the SyntaLinker method was validated in three\ncase studies derived from the literature to demonstrate the\ncapability of fragment linking, lead optimization, and scaﬀold\nhopping. To make sure diverse structures are generated, only\nthe SyntaLinker model was used in the case studies. It is\nworthwhile to mention that the ground truth compounds in\nthese examples were not included in the training set of our\nSyntaLinker models.\nEvaluation metrics for the SyntaLinker model\nThe ultimate goal of our model is to generate diverse molecules,\ncontaining a pair of fragments. Therefore, four diﬀerent metrics\non 2D level, validity, uniqueness, recovery and novelty, were\nemployed to compare generated molecules and their ground\ntruth in the test set.\n67,68 Here, validity refers to the percentage of\ngenerated chemically valid molecules with a pair of fragments;\nnovelty is the percentage of generated chemically valid mole-\ncules with novel linkers (not present in the training set);\nuniqueness is the number of unique structures generated and\nrecovery means the percentage of ground truth generated\namong test set compounds. Formally,\nValidity ¼\n# of chemically valid SMILES with fragments\n# of generated SMILES\n(4)\nUniqueness ¼ # of non-duplicate; valid structures\n# of valid structures (5)\nNovelty ¼ # of novel linkers not in training set\n# of unique structures (6)\nThe quality of compounds generated by the SyntaLinker\nmodel at the 3D level was also examined. In this case, the 3D\nconformations of compounds are generated and docked into\nprotein binding pockets; the root mean square deviation\n(RMSD), and shape and colour combo-similarity score (SC) to\nthe X-ray bound conformation of the actual ligand are gener-\nated to evaluate the model performance for selected cases. Here,\nRMSD is merely calculated among a pair of fragments of the X-\nray and generated structures. The SC score is calculated by the\npharmacophoric feature similarity\n69 and the shape similarity70\nbetween the X-ray conformation of the actual ligand and the\ndocking pose of the generated structure. The SC score is a real\nnumber in the range of [0,1] and the higher its value, the more\nsimilar the generated molecule is to the original ligand. For\neach molecule, the best similarity score among all docking\nconformers was taken as the SC score. In the current study,\nconverting SMILES to the 3D conformation and docking were\ndone by using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE)\nsoware.\n71 The RMSD and SC score for each conformation were\ncalculated via RDkit.65\nModel training and optimization of hyperparameters\nSyntaLinker was implemented in OpenNMT.72 All scripts were\nwritten in Python73 (version 3.7). We trained the models on GPU\n(Nvidia 2080Ti), and saved the checkpoint per 1000 steps. The\nbest hyperparameters were obtained based on the recovery\nmetric of the ChEMBL validation set. We built our model with\nthe best hyperparameters (shown in Table S1†) and adopted the\nbeam search procedure\n74 to generate multiple candidates with\na special beam width. All generated candidates were canon-\nicalized in RDkit and compared with the ground-truth\nmolecules.\nResults and discussion\nEventually, we obtained 784 728 FMQs from 718 652 unique\nmolecules from our data preparation process. As mentioned in\nthe above section, three types of models were trained,i.e. SLBD\nonly (SyntaLinker) and SLBD plus pharmacophore constraints\n(SyntaLinker_multi) and the reference model without using any\nconstraint (SyntaLinker_n). The performance of our models on\nthe ChEMBL test set and CASF validation set was examined. It is\nworth noting that the SyntaLinker method merely uses 2D\nmolecular topology for model building, while the DeLinker\nmethod requires pre-generated three-dimensional conforma-\ntions of a molecule as well as the relative 3D spatial information\nbetween fragments for creating the training set.\nModel performance on the ChEMBL test set\nWe rst validated the performance of SyntaLinker on the\nChEMBL test set using 2D metrics. Top 10 candidates for each\npair of starting fragments were generated. The results are listed\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 Chem.

All the models achieved over 95% validity, 90%\nlinker novelty and recovered over 80% of the original molecules,\ndemonstrating that the conditional transformer model can\nlearn to identify the linker part of the structures, generate the\nlinker accordingly, and also the models are generalized well\nenough to create new linkers. It seems that the constraint\nmodels are better than the model without using any constraint\nin terms of recovery, novelty and validity. Especially, the most\ndetailed constraint model SyntaLinker_multi achieves\na recovery rate of 87.1% in the top 10 recommendations. This is\ndue to the fact that more prior knowledge about the linker is\ndened in the multiple constraint model than others.\nModel performance on CASF\nTo compare with the DeLinker model (downloaded from https://\ngithub.com/oxpig/DeLinker), we further evaluated the models\non the external validation set CASF-2016,\n66 which was used in\nthe DeLinker model. Following the same sampling strategy as\nDeLinker, we generated 250 molecules for each pair of starting\nfragments. The detailed performance of various models on the\nsame validation set is listed in Table 2.\nThese metrics indicate that the performance of our models is\nsignicantly improved over the DeLinker model on the CASF\nvalidation set. Especially, our model improves the linker novelty\nof the DeLinker model by a margin of 20% without losing the\nrecovery, meaning SyntaLinker can sample a diverse range of\nlinkers more eﬀectively.\nEﬃciency of controlling structure generation\nSyntaLinker aims to generate molecular structures that comply\nwith the given criteria. We further calculated the SLBD and\npharmacophore properties of the linkers in the generated\nmolecules to verify whether these constraints were complied.\nThe original linker bond length and pharmacophore properties\nof compounds in test sets were set as the control criterion when\ngenerating structures using the constrained model SyntaLinker\nand SyntaLinker_multi respectively, while SyntaLinker_n\n(unconstrained model) had no control criterion. For structures\ngenerated by all three models, the linker length and pharma-\ncophore properties were examined for comparison purpose.\nBesides evaluating the control eﬃciency on the ChEMBL test set\nand CASF validation set, the eﬀect of beam search width (top 10\nand top 250) was also assessed.\nSLBD controlling eﬃciency of three SyntaLinker models on\nthe ChEMBL test set in top 10 and top 250 are shown in Fig. 3a\nand b. They contain the percentage of structures with correct\nSLBD and structures whose SLBD variation is less than one\nbond distance. 79.2%, 78.1% and 39.9% of structures have\nexactly the same SLBD as the control for SyntaLinker, Synta-\nLinker_multi and SyntaLinker_n models respectively. That is,\nthe models with length constraints (SyntaLinker, Synta-\nLinker_multi) outperform the model without constraints (Syn-\ntaLinker_n). Moreover, if SLBD is allowed to vary within one\nbond, then the percentage of structures complying the criteria\nfrom three models are 96.1%, 96.2% and 69% respectively.\nFor the CASF validation set, the same trend was observed in\nFig. 3c. When we increase the beam search width from 10 to\n250, the control eﬃciency of the shortest bond length for all\nthree models will decrease (Fig. 3b and d). However, the\nconditional model still demonstrates superior performance to\nthe one without condition restrictions.\nThe percentage of structures with exactly equivalent phar-\nmacophore properties to their ground truth from all three\nSyntaLinker models on the ChEMBL test set in top-10 and top-\n250 is depicted in Fig. 4. As expected, the model with pharma-\ncophore constraints (SyntaLinker_multi) outperforms the\nmodel without this constraint (SyntaLinker, SyntaLinker_n),\nwhere 36.5%, 55.2% and 35.0% of structures have exactly the\nsame pharmacophore properties as the control for SyntaLinker,\nSyntaLinker_multi and, SyntaLinker_n models on the ChEMBL\ntest set. For the CASF validation set also the same trend was\nobserved. Furthermore, when the beam search width was\nincreased from 10 to 250, the control eﬃciency of the phar-\nmacophore for all three models decreased. Due to the combi-\nnation of multiple constraints, the control e ﬃciency of\npharmacophore constraints is lower than the one with the bond\nlength constraint (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the model with the\nconstraints is superior to the model without constraints.\nTable 1 Performance comparison of models with diﬀerent constraints\non the ChEMBL test set\nMetrics\nModels\nSyntaLinker (%)\nSyntaLinker_multi\n(%)\nSyntaLinker_n\n(%)\nValidity 97.2 97.8 96.0\nUniqueness 88.1 84.9 86.7\nRecovery 84.7 87.1 80.\nNovelty 91.8 92.3 90.3\nTable 2 Performance comparison of models on the CASF-2016 validation set\nMetrics\nModels\nDeLinker (%) SyntaLinker (%) SyntaLinker_multi (%) SyntaLinker_n (%)\nValidity 95.5 96.4 96.5 86.8\nUniqueness 51.9 69.9 63.8 65.6\nRecovery 53.7 62.7 60.2 55.4\nNovelty 51.0 75.4 77.2 71.3\n8316 | Chem.

For each pair of fragments in the\nChEMBL test set, the properties of its top 10 and top 250\ncandidates were calculated and averaged to obtain a nal\nvalue. A comparison with the properties of the original\nChEMBL data (Fig. 5) showed that molecules generated from\nSyntaLinker models have signicantly higher QED and lower\nSAscore values than the ones for ChEMBL compounds, sug-\ngesting that SyntaLinker generated molecules are more lead-\nlike and have lower complexityfor synthesis comparing with\nChEMBL molecules. This is probably due to the fact that the\nchosen starting fragment pairs restraint the properties of the\ngenerated structures. The distributions of logP and MW are\nsimilar among ChEMBL and SyntaLinker generated mole-\ncules. Diﬀerences of all calculated properties among Synta-\nLinker models are trivial.\nAttention analysis\nTo investigate what the SyntaLinker has learned, we further\nanalysed the attention weights for a linker generation example\n(as shown in Fig. 6). The attention weights provide clues on the\nimportance of SMILES tokens in the input fragments for indi-\nvidual output character when the output sequence was gener-\nated. Fig. 6, for example, maps out the top candidate's attention\nweights extracted from the SyntaLinker model (with the SLBD\nconstraint of 3), where the darker colour refers to larger\nimportance of the character in the input. It is observed that in\nthe le upper and right lower region of the attention map,\ndiagonal cells obviously have larger weights, which corresponds\nto the high similarity between the SMILES substrings of input\nfragments and the terminal sections of the output structure.\nFig. 3 The comparison of eﬃciency in controlling SLBD for three SyntaLinker models.

For the tokens in the linker part of the output\nstructure, the token“.” in the input structure has larger weight\nthan other tokens, which means the model recognizes the\nseparation token between two fragments of the input structure\nand lls in the linker part in the correct place.\nIn other words, the SyntaLinker model is able to identify the\nSMILES substrings for the terminal fragments of the input\nsequence and rearrange them correctly in the output sequence.\nMeanwhile, the breaking position in the input sequence can also\nbe identied and the linker tokens are successfully added in,\neven though they are not arranged sequentially. As we can see\nthat, in this example, an additional ring is created as the linker,\nring number tokens can still be correctly assigned. This suggests\nthat the SyntaLinker model has learned the implicit rules from\nthe ChEMBL dataset and can nicely deal with both the local and\nglobal information during the structure generation.\nFragment linking case\nFragment linking aims to increase the aﬃnity. For example,\nTrapero and colleagues identied phenylimidazole derivatives\nwith low aﬃnities against IMPDH through a virtual screening\ncampaign. By linking fragments from original lead compound,\nthey discovered a new molecule increased with more than 1000-\nfold binding aﬃnity.\n75 Using the same fragments (PDB: 5OU2),\nwe also generated the linked molecule (PDB: 5OU3) through the\nSyntaLinker model (Fig. 7).\nStarting from the fragments in 5OU2 with the SLBD condi-\ntion of 3 to 5, we generated 500 candidates with SyntaLinker.\nThe native molecule (Fig. 7b) was successfully recovered and\naer 3D conformer generation and docking, most of the\nFig. 6 The top-1 candidate's attention map extracted from the SyntaLinker model.\nFig. 7 Fragment linking case study.

Three generated molecules with\nthe highest 3D fragment similarity and favourable MOE dock-\ning scores are depicted in Fig. 8, where the native ligand\nbinding poses are recovered by SyntaLinker (Fig. 8c).\nLead optimization case\nLead optimization is an iterative process of continuously\nmodifying lead structures to improve potency and ADMET\nproperties aer initial lead compounds are identied. Here, we\nmimicked a typical lead optimization processvia SyntaLinker.\nDequalinium (Fig. 9c) has an inhibitory eﬀect on chitinase A in\nthe low nanomolar range (Ki: 70 nM), and is a promising lead\nagainst chitinase-mediated pathologies.\n76 Previous studies have\ndemonstrated dequalinium's binding mode (PDB: 3ARP), and\nproven that linking two fragments (Fig. 9d) with a decane linker\nis critical, as it occupies the hydrophobic areas in the binding\npocket.\nTo optimize dequalinium, we used the MMPs algorithm to\nderive fragment pairs from the molecule. This resulted in 45\nnon-redundant fragment pairs. They were used as terminal\nfragments for running SyntaLinker and 100 candidates were\ngenerated for each pair. The original linker bond length in\ndequalinium is set as the SLBD constraint for each pair.\nDequalinium (native ligand) was recovered in these trials, and\naer removing redundant molecules, the RMSDs of two frag-\nments were calculated. Details are also listed in Table 3.\nSyntaLinker can generate a large number of novel molecules.\nAmong these molecules, 179 molecules have RMSD values less\nthan 2 ˚A comparing with dequalinium, and 30 molecules have\nan RMSD value less than 1˚A comparing with dequalinium.

Some molecules similar to\ndequalinium (the lead) are depicted in Fig. 10. Fig. 11 lists three\nmolecules generated by SyntaLinker and their RMSD values in\ncomparison with dequalinium structure. Our SyntaLinker\nmodel seems to give chemically reasonable compounds (three\nexamples are shown in Fig. 11) and also better RMSD and SC\nmetrics. This may be because chemically more attractive linkers\nexisted in our ChEMBL training set and also the ease of learning\nchemical syntactics by a sequence generation model comparing\nwith the graph generation model.\nScaﬀold hopping case\nScaﬀold hopping aims to explicitly change the scaﬀold topology\nwhile still preserving the biological activity. In this study, to test\nthe scaﬀold hopping capacity of SyntaLinker, two JNK3 inhibi-\ntors, indazole (PDB: 3FI3) and aminopyrazole (PDB: 3FI2)\nderivatives, were used as examples.\n77 Both inhibitors have\nalmost the same binding modes as JNK3 (Fig. 12).\nSyntaLinker generated 2500 molecules with the restriction of\nSLBD ranging from 6 to 8. This resulted in 2138 non-redundant\nmolecules, in which more than thousand molecules had RMSD\nvalues less than 1˚A and SC values greater than 0.5. 634 linkers\nare novel (not found in the training set) covering 186 unique\nMurcko scaﬀolds.\n78 Both indazole (Fig. 13a) and aminopyrazole\nnative molecules (Fig. 13b) were also recovered. This result\nhighlights that our SyntaLinker model is well generalized to\ndesign novel linkers by combining the chemical information of\nstarting fragments, not merely remembering the linkers in the\nChEMBL training set.\nFig. 13 demonstrates the binding modes for eight generated\nstructures with novel sca ﬀolds. These new molecules are\nsuperimposed nicely with the native ligand.\nConclusions\nConventional fragment linking paradigm requires pre-dening\na set of fragments (aka substructures or chemotypes) and then,\nassembling them into molecules with rigid transformation\nrules or reaction rules. By implementing SyntaLinker, we prove\nthat linking fragments can be accomplished by the syntactic\npattern recognition technique. We used deep transformer\nneural networks to learn the implicit rules of linking fragments\namong ChEMBL compounds by recognizing syntactic patterns\nembedded in SMILES. Our results demonstrate that the Synta-\nLinker model is able to generate molecular structures based on\na given pair of fragments and additional restrictions. The\nattention map analysis shows that the transformer model can\nsuccessfully recognize the terminal fragments in the input\nsequence, learn the implicit rules in generating linkers, as well\nas assemble these substructures together. Furthermore, Synta-\nLinker can be used in drug design processes, such as virtual\nlibrary construction from fragments, lead optimization, and\nscaﬀold hopping, as we have demonstrated in this work.\nNotes\nThe source code and data of SyntaLinker are available online at\nhttps://github.com/YuYaoYang2333/SyntaLinker.\nConﬂicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was funded in part of the National Key R&D Program\nof China (2017YFB0203403), the Science and Technology\nProgram of Guangzhou (201604020109), the Guangdong\nProvincial Key Lab. of New Drug Design and Evaluation (Grant\n2011A060901014).\nReferences\n1 R.
