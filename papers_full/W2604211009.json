In case of a short-circuit incident, as the\npower system capacity and the voltage level increase,\nthe short-circuit current will reach tens of times or\neven hundreds of times of CT rated current, leading\nto CT saturation. In that situation, CT cannot trans-\nfer the primary current correctly, which causes mis-\noperation or mal-operation of protection equipment\nand greater errors of fault location equipment. In\nresponse to this, manufacturers open a small air gap\non the core of CT, which is about one-thousandth of\nthe total length of the magnetic circuit. Among the\nCTs that have been widely put into use, the PR-type\nand the TPY-level of the TP-type are those who have\nair-gaps in their cores. The air-gapped CT can guar-\nantee that the errors are within the permissible\nrange of the relay protection in the steady state and\nthe transient state. Establ ishing the simulation model\nof air-gapped CT and studying its transient charac-\nteristics will help to understand the role of air gap\nmore accurately, and to guide the selection and\ndesign of air-gapped CT.\nCurrently, there are large number of papers on the\nclosed-core CT modeling. The advantages and disad-\nvantages of different models and their application\nranges are introduced in detail in [1]. However, there\nare only a few studies have been accomplished on\nmodeling air-gapped CT. In [2], the real-time\nmagnetization curve is generated by hysteresis loop\ncompressing method, and th e real-time excitation\ninductance is calculated by using the arc tangent\nfunction to fit the limiting hysteresis loop, in which\nway the air-gapped CT model is established on the\nPSCAD/EMTDC platform. This model can simulate\nthe saturation characteristics of air-gapped CT, but\nthe simulation of the core is not accurate enough. In\n[3], the air-gapped CT model is established based on\nJiles-Atherton (JA) Theory. This model can\naccurately simulate the effect of air gap on the\nmagnetization process. However, the parameters such\nas regional coupling coefficient, thermal coefficient,\nregional flexibility, direction coefficient, which are\nrequired for the JA theoretical model, are often hard\n* Correspondence: wuyh04@gmail.com\nState Key Laboratory of Control and Simulation of Power Systems and\nGeneration Equipment, Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua\nUniversity, Beijing 100084, China\nProtection and Control of\nModern Power Systems\n© The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.\nWu et al.

Theoretical model of air-gapped CT given in\n[4] is established by deducing the relationship\nbetween the equivalent excitation inductance of an\nair-gapped CT and that of a closed-core CT, using\nprinciples of circuits and magnetic circuits. The\nmodel can be used to deduce the performance of\nair-gapped CT, to demonstrate the role of air gap,\nbut cannot give the specific value of the excitation\ninductance; hence, it cannot be used for simulation.\nAccording to [4], using the finite element analysis\nsoftware ANSYS to calculate the real-time excitation\ninductance, CT equivalent equation is solved for\nnumerical solution [5], but the process is complex,\nand it is not conducive to simulation either.\nPreisach Theory, which is a phenomenological\napproach to explain the magnetization process [6],\ncan fit very well with the experimental data. Numer-\nous papers and data have testified the feasibility and\naccuracy of Preisach Theory [7 – 11]. A TPY-level\nmodel is proposed in [10], which is complicated and\nneeds lots of experimental data due to the involving\nwith identification and calculation of Everett func-\ntion. Based on Preisach magnetization Theory, an\nair-gapped CT model is proposed in this paper,\nwhich is deduced from the closed-core CT model.\nThe model can correctly simulate the magnetization\nprocess of air-gapped core, and the data needed for\nm o d e l i n ga r ee a s yt ob eo b t ained. Model parameters\ncan be set arbitrarily, and simulation can be\nperformed easily. The saturation and remanence\ncharacteristics of the air-gapped CT model and the\nclosed-core CT model of the same structure and\nparameters are compared in simulation.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Introduction to Preisach magnetization theory\nPreisach magnetization Theory is proposed by the\nGerman physicist F. Preisach in 1935. After continuous\nimproving and perfecting, it has gradually formed a\nguiding theory to the ferromagnetic material modeling\n[8, 12 – 15].\nPreisach Theory holds tha t the ferromagnetic ma-\nterial consists of numerous magnetic dipoles, each of\nwhich has its own saturation characteristics, as\nshown in Fig. 1. Macroscopic magnetization shown\nby ferromagnetic material is the accumulation of the\nmicroscopic magnetization of all the magnetic di-\npoles that make up it. Each magnetic dipole has its\nown positive saturation threshold α and negative\nsaturation threshold β. As the name implies, when\nthe applied magnetic field strength is greater than\nthe positive saturation threshold α,t h em a g n e t i cd i -\npole enters the positive saturation state. When the\napplied magnetic field strength is less than β., the\nmagnetic dipole enters the negative saturation state,\nand when the applied magnetic field strength is be-\ntween β and α,b o t hs t a t em a ym a g n e t i cd i p o l eb e\nin, depending on the historical change of the mag-\nnetic field, which manifests itself as a memory char-\nacteristic of ferromagnetic matter.\nWhile using Preisach Theory to calculate the core\nmagnetic flux density, it is only necessary to calculate\nthe difference between the integral of the magnetic\ndipole distribution density in region S+ and the inte-\ngral in region S−. in the triangle ABC in Preisach dia-\ngram as Fig. 2 shows.\nBHðÞ ¼ BS ∬Sþ μα ; βðÞ dαdβ−∬S− μα ; βðÞ dαdβ\n/C0/C1\nð1Þ\nFig. 1 Magnetization characteristics of the magnetic dipole\nFig. 2 A typical Preisach diagram\nWu et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems  (2017) 2:11 Page 2 of 11\nIn Equation (1), μ(α, β) represents the distribution\ndensity of magnetic dipoles, and should have the follow-\ning properties:\n1) α < β, μ(α, β)=0 ;\n2) if α > Hsat or β < −Hsat, μ(α, β)=0\nWhere, Hsat is positive saturation field strength;\n3) μ(α, β)= μ(−β, −α)\nThe changes of magnetic field strength H influence the\nvalue of flux density B in the following way: when H is\ngreater than Hsat,S + covers the entire triangle area, at\nwhich time the core is in a positive saturation state. When\nH is smaller than − Hsat,S −, covers the entire triangle area,\nat which time the core is in a negative saturation state.\nWhen H decreases, triangle ABC will be swept down by a\nstraight line perpendicular to the β-axis, β = H,t h e na l l\nthe magnetic dipoles whose β value is greater than H will\nenter the negative saturation state, so the swept area is\ncovered by S−.W h e n H increases, triangle ABC will be\nswept down by a straight line perpendicular to the α-\naxis, α = H, then all the magnetic dipoles whose α value\nis smaller than H will enter the positive saturation state,\nso the swept area is covered by S+.\nSince it is hard to determine μ(α, β) and to calculate\ndouble integral, reference [8] put forward the assump-\ntion that variables in μ(α, β) can be separated.\nμα ; βðÞ ¼ μα αðÞ μβ βðÞ ð 2Þ\nSo double integral is transferred into single integral,\nand formulas (3, 4 and 5), can be deduced according to\nthe shapes of different Preisach diagrams [16].\nBi HðÞ ¼ Bd HðÞ =2 þ Bu HðÞ =2ðÞ 2 Bd HðÞðÞ −1H≥0 ð3Þ\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\nBd HðÞ\np\n¼ F −HðÞ ð 4Þ\nBu HðÞ ¼ Bd HðÞ −2FHðÞ F −HðÞ ð 5Þ\nWhere, Bd(H), Bu(H), Bi(H) is the limiting descending\nbranch, the limiting ascending branch and the virgin\ncurve respectively.

Formulas (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) are used to\ncalculate the flux density when the core is not saturated,\nand when it is saturated, magnetization trajectory will\nturn into single valued, so it is easy to calculate using\ncurve fitting method.\nIn conclusion, according to the Preisach Theory, CT\ncore model can be established accurately by measuring\nthe descending branch of limiting hysteresis loop and\npositive saturation magnetization curve, when structure\nof CT ’s core is fixed and the outside temperature does\nnot change obviously.\n2.2 Modeling of closed-core CT based on Preisach theory\nCT’s simplified equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 3. In\nthe figure, i1 and im are the primary and exciting cur-\nrents which are both converted to secondary side; also,\ni2 is the secondary current, R2 and L2 are the total resist-\nance and total inductance of secondary side, and Lm is\nthe equivalent excitation inductance.

(10) and (11), N2 is the number of secondary\ncoil, A is the cross area of iron core, B is magnetic flux\ndensity in the core. Discrete Eq.

Equation (12) is\ncalled the solving equation of CT. Since the mag-\nnetic flux density B increases monotonously with the\nexciting current, the solving equation can be solved\nin the following way: assume that the flux density\nand the exciting current at time instant k are the\nsame as at time instant k − 1, which means substitut-\ning im(k)= im(k − 1) and B(k)= B(k − 1) to the left\nside of (12), then calculate the value of the right\nside, compare it with the left, if left < right, increase\nim(k), otherwise decrease im(k), till left = right. The\nsolving process is joint with core model, while the\ncore model is air-gapped, air-gapped CT model is\ngot, otherwise closed-core CT model is established.\nCore model based on Preisach Theory is established\nas follows.\nUsing the arctangent function and the hyperbolic func-\ntion, the descending branch of limiting hysteresis loop of\nmeasured closed-core can be fitted. As shown in Fig. 4,\nthe measured CT core is closed, with circular shape, the\naverage magnetic path length l = 0.62 m, sectional area\nA = 2.508 × 10 − 3 m2.\nThe non-integer power is used to fit the measured\npositive saturation curve, as shown in Fig. 5. Using\nthe fitting result, the values of flux density for\narbitrary magneti zation process can be calculated\naccording to Preisach Theory. The displayed results\nin Figs. 6 and 7 show the magnetization curve and\nthe waveform of applied magnetic field strength\nrespectively.\n2.3 Modeling of air-gapped CT based on Preisach Theory\nThe air-gapped CT core is shown in Fig. 8, where l0\nis the gap length. Since the air gap length is much\nsmaller than the total length of the magnetic circuit,\ntypically about one thousandth of it, so the following\nassumptions can be made: the fracture surfaces are\nparallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field\nlines; the magnetic field lines at the edge of the gap\nwill not protrude. The total length of magnetic cir-\ncuit could be set as l, and length of magnetic circuit\nin core as l1, magnetic field strength in core as H1,\nand magnetic field strength in gap as H0; hence, the\nexciting current converted to one turn is.\nie ¼ H1l1 þ H0l0 ð13Þ\nWhere, H0 = B/μ0 and the magnetization curve of air-\ngapped core could be calculated by:\nFig. 4 Descending branch of limiting hysteresis loop of closed-core\nand its fitted curve\nFig. 5 Positive saturation curve of closed-core and its fitted curve\nFig. 6 Magnetization curve of closed-core CT model based on\nPreisach theory\nWu et al.

In the case of the de-\nscending branch of closed-core ’sl i m i t i n gh y s t e r e s i sl o o p\nknown, the descending branch of the limiting hysteresis\nloop of the air-gapped core with different lengths of air\ngap can be calculated by (14), as shown in Fig. 9.\nIn Fig. 9, waveforms a, b, and c are the descending\nbranches of limiting hysteresis loop of the core with air\ngap ratios of 0.001, 0.002, and 0.003, respectively. As\ncan be seen in Fig. 9, the longer the air gap is, the\ngreater the saturation magneti c field strength will be. In\nthis paper, the iron core model is established by select-\ning the data of the core with the air gap ratio of 0.001.\nAs a comparison, Fig. 10 shows the limiting hysteresis\nloops of closed core and air-gapped core with gap ratio\nof 0.0005.\n3 Results\n3.1 Characteristics of saturation\nA test circuit is simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC to gener-\nate different primary currents, as shown in Fig. 11.

Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems  (2017) 2:11 Page 5 of 11\nmodel are inputted respectively with data of primary\ncurrent to compare the saturation characteristics and\nremanence characteristics. Parameters are set as: current\nratio 1: 500, load resistance 4 Ω, coil resistance 1 Ω, the\nload inductance and leakage inductance of the secondary\nside amount to 0.8 mH.\nCharacteristics of saturation are shown in Figs. 12 and\n13. A-G fault occurs at 0.1 s, and the fault current con-\ntains a significant DC component. The primary current\nis converted to the secondary side.\nThe short dashed line in Fig. 12 is the curve of flux\ndensity in Tesla which its axis is shown on the right side.\nThe solid line and the long dashed line are, respectively,\nprimary and secondary current respectively in Amperes\nwhich their axis are depicted on the left side. It can be\nseen that the closed-core CT is saturated. The course of\nsaturation can be analyzed from Figs. 12 and 13. In the\nfirst cycle after the fault, since the current transformer\ncore has no remanence, the magnetic flux density in-\ncreases from zero, and does not reach the saturation\nthreshold in the first cycle, so the transformer is not satu-\nrated. Starting from the second cycle, due to the role of\nremanence caused by the first cycle, flux density gradually\nreaches the saturation threshold and exceed, so the core\ngets saturated. When primary current crosses zero and in-\ncreases in reverse, the flux density decreases gradually\nuntil saturation is removed. The coordinate of the\nsaturation starting point (0.15, 1.787) for the third cycle is\nmarked in Fig. 12.\n4 Discussion\nSince the core material and structure of both current\ntransformer model are the same, so the critical sat-\nuration flux densities are also equal. As can be seen\nfrom Fig. 13, the core magnetic flux density does\nnot reach a critical saturation value of 1.787 T at all\ntime, and the magnetic flux density falls faster in the\nfalling portion of each cycle than that of the closed-\ncore CT, thereby causing the rising portion to always\nfail in reaching the saturation threshold. The mag-\nnetic flux density in the air-gapped CT model\nreaches a maximum value of 1.657 T after the sec-\nond cycle of the fault, and then the amplitude of the\nflux density gradually becomes smaller due to the\ndecay of the DC component, and the transformer\ndoes not saturate. Even though the air-gapped CT\nshown in Fig. 13 suppresses the saturation due to\nFig. 10 Comparison of limiting hysteresis loops of closed core and\nair-gapped core with gap ratio of 0.0005\nFig. 11 Simulation circuit in PSCAD/EMTDC\nFig. 12 Waveforms of closed-core CT ’s primary current, secondary\ncurrent and magnetic flux density\nFig. 13 Waveforms of air-gapped CT ’s primary current, secondary\ncurrent and magnetic flux density\nWu et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems  (2017) 2:11 Page 6 of 11\nthe existence of the air gap, it also has the larger\ntransmission error. This is because of the fact that\nthe equivalent inductance of air-gapped core is\nsmaller, resulting in fault current having a larger\ndiversion in the excitation branch.\n4.1 Characteristics of remanence\nRemanence properties are divided into two aspects. The\nfirst one is the core remanence which affects on satur-\nation during fault incident, and the second one is the\nelimination of the remanence during steady-state after\nfault clearance.\nFor the first aspect, the following four conditions have\nbeen simulated and compared: a) 50% of the positive\nremanence, magnetic flux generated at fault occurring\ntime is positive; b) 50% of the positive remanence, mag-\nnetic flux generated at fault occurring time is negative;\nc) 50% of the negative remanence, magnetic flux gener-\nated at fault occurring time is positive; d) 50% of the\nnegative remanence, magnetic flux generated at fault oc-\ncurring time is negative.\nFigures 14, 15, 16 and 17 depict the results of the four\ngroups of simulations; the first line in each group of\nresults are magnetic flux density curve, and primary,\nsecondary current comparison of closed-core CT, the\nsecond line in each group of results are magnetic flux\ndensity curve and primary and secondary current con-\ntrast of air-gapped CT.\nAs can be seen from Figs. 14, 15, 16 and 17, since the\nremanence level is low, ± 50% of the remanence is close\nto zero; thereforethe air-gapped CT does not saturate,\nregardless of the polarity of magnetic flux generated at\nfault occurring time same with remanence or not.\nThe closed-core CT is saturated when the remanence\npolarity is the same with the magnetic flux polarity of\nfault current at the moment of fault, and is saturated\nfaster and deeper than in the case of zero remanence in\nFig. 12, but is not saturated when the remanence polar-\nity is opposite to the polarity of magnetic flux generated\nat fault occurring time. Comparing the two types of CT ’s\nflux density - time curves, it can be found that, in each\ncase, the trend of the two are basically the same, but\nclosed-core CT ’s flux density changes faster, can quickly\nreach the positive or negative saturation threshold,\nWhile the air-gapped core CT changes slower, with a\nsmaller magnitude. This is because of the fact that the\nmagnetization curve of the iron core with air gap\nbecomes narrow and to reach the same magnetic flux\ndensity will require a larger excitation current. In other\nwords, the iron core of the air-gapped CT is harder to\nbe magnetized.\nThen the characteristics of eliminating remanence\nafter fault clearance are compared. The simulation con-\nditions are as follows: the transmission line experience\nan A-G fault at 0.1 s; the fault is cleared at 0.155 s; total\nsimulation time is 0.5 s. The core remanence of both\nCTs are compared at the end of the simulation, and the\nresults are shown in Fig. 18.\nIn Fig. 18, the dotted line and the solid line are\nchanges of magnetic flux in the core of the closed-core\nFig. 14 50% remanence, magnetic flux generated at fault occurring time is positive\nWu et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems  (2017) 2:11 Page 7 of 11\nCT and the air-gapped CT, respectively. According to\nFig. 18, for air-gapped CT, the remanence of iron core\ndecreases continuously with the increase of running\ntime, and decreases to 0.127 T at 0.5 s, which is about\n7.1% of the saturation magnetic flux density; and for\nclosed-core CT, the remanence is stable after the fault is\nremoved, the minimum value of which is 1.312 T, which\nis much larger than the air-gapped CT. When the subse-\nquent fault occurs, if magnetic flux generated at fault\noccurring time is positive, it superimposes on the initial\nvalue of remanence, so the closed-core CT saturates eas-\nily. In the same condition, air-gapped CT core magnetic\nFig. 15 50% remanence, magnetic flux generated at fault occurring time is negative\nFig. 16 -50% remanence, magnetic flux generated at fault occurring time is positive\nWu et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems  (2017) 2:11 Page 8 of 11\nflux density will increase from the smaller value,\n0.127 T, more difficult to reach saturation. This\nphenomenon has been verified in the simulations below,\nas shown in Fig. 14.\nFigures 19 and 20, respectively give the two types\nof CT ’s magnetization curve in the simulation.\nFigure 19a shows the magnetization curve of whole\nprocess of closed-core CT. It includes three areas, in\nwhich hysteresis loops are formed: oval box is for\nthe loops before the fault, small hysteresis loops\nformed during steady-stat e operation; dashed rect-\nangular box is for the loop of the first cycle after\nfault, and it could be seen that during the first cycle,\nclosed-core CT does not saturate, which is compat-\nible with the result shown in Fig. 12; solid line box\nis for the loops after the fault clearance, which is en-\nlarged to get Fig. 19b. It can be seen that the\nclosed-core CT, while entering into the steady sound\nstate, runs near the remanence value in the form of\nsmall hysteresis loops. Considering both Figs. 18 and\n19, shows that while closed-core CT transferring\ninto the steady sound state, magnetic flux density in\ncore is also falling with the increase of time, but the\nspeed is very low, so there will be a lot of small hys-\nteresis loops with small intervals.\nFigure 20a shows the magnetization curve of whole\nprocess of air-gapped CT. The dotted box is the trajec-\ntory of the ending part of simulation and the solid box is\nthe trajectory of the beginning part of simulation. Enlar-\nging the ending part gets Fig. 20b. According to Fig. 20,\nthe air-gapped CT ’s hysteresis loops are narrow, com-\npared to the closed-core one. When the line fault is\ncleared, the core magnetic flux density continues to de-\ncline in an approximately spiral way, does not form a\nstable hysteresis loop. The core remanence value is grad-\nually approaching zero. It can also be seen that the rem-\nanence of air-gapped CT can be gradually digested and,\nafter the clearance it becomes lower than a certain level,\nusually 10% of saturation flux density.\n5 Conclusions\nBased on the Preisach core magnetization theory, the\nair-gapped core CT model is established, in which the\nFig. 17 -50% remanence, magnetic flux generated at fault occurring time is negative\nFig. 18 Remanence comparison of iron cores in CT after\nfault clearance\nWu et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems  (2017) 2:11 Page 9 of 11\ndata required for the core modeling is the descending\nbranch of limiting hysteresis loop. The data can be ob-\ntained by experimental measurement, or from the\nclosed-core CT with same core structure, shape and ma-\nterial. This model can correctly simulate the\nmagnetization process of the air-gapped core, and the\nparameters can be set arbitrarily for simulation. The sat-\nuration characteristics and remanence characteristics of\nclosed-core CT model and air-gapped CT model with\nsame core structure, shape, material and parameters\nwere simulated and compared. The results indicated the\neffects of air gap on CT performance, and proved the\nproposed model. The proposed modeling method can be\nutilized in CT selection and design, especially in CT de-\nsign to analyze the necessary length of air gap in iron\ncore. The correctness of the proposed method is based\non the experimental validation of many existing papers\nand the theoretical deducing and simulation of this\npaper, so the expectation of this method is, if possible,\nconducting an experiment with CT manufactures to\nmeasure the hysteresis trajectory of an iron core before\nand after opening an air gap in it. As a result, the\nproposed method can be validated in a further step.\nFunding\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (Grant No. 51120175001), and in part by Science and Technology\nProject of State Grid Corporation of China (GWKJ2013-005).\nAuthors’ contributions\nYa Hui Wu investigated the research status of air-gapped TA modeling, and\nestablished the proposed air-gapped TA model, then tested it with simulation\nand drafted the manuscript.
