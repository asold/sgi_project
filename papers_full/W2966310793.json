    "abstract": "Background: Integrated personalized diabetes management (iPDM) is a digitally supported therapeutic concept to improve patient-physician interaction to overcome the aspects of clinical inertia. Integrated personalized diabetes management can support decision making and improve therapeutic outcomes of suboptimally controlled persons with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this paper, we report the results of an analysis of the PDM-ProValue study program on the effectiveness and perceived benefit of this approach, with a focus on how physicians used and assessed the digital tools provided for the iPDM process. Materials and Methods: The study program included two 12-month, prospective, controlled, cluster-randomized multicenter trials. A total of 101 practices participated with 907 patients. Practices were cluster-randomized to an intervention group and a control group. Digital tools for data visualization and analysis applied were used. HCP were asked to assess the use, relevance, and usefulness of the tools. Results: A clear preference was stated for the visual overview over more statistically complex analyses. A total of 83% of the participants rated a high relevance of the “daily profile,” 81% of the “total profile,” and 68% the “risk illustrated by traffic light symbols” for the therapy decision. The overall iPDM process was very favorably rated with respect to structuredness and potential for personalized treatment and well accepted among health care professionals (HCP). Conclusions: Embedding digital tools in a structured process (iPDM) were proved to provide a benefit for insulin-treated T2D patients and their physicians. These results offer insight for further development and improvement of the tools and add information on how to overcome clinical inertia.",
