    "abstract": "Fault detection of Substation Power Transformer by Non-contact measurement is important for the safety of machines, instruments, and human beings. To make non-contact measurement as convenient as possible, it is desirable that efficient algorithms based on AE (acoustic emission) discrimination are developed. This paper presents a system for quick and effective fault detection of substation power transformer, based on AE signals collected by non-contact single microphones. In the experiment, collected data were preprocessed in multiple ways and three machine learning algorithms were designed based on classifiers (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm) trained and tested by a tenfold cross-validation technique. After comparison among the designed classifiers, the results show the two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) preprocess combined with SVM achieved the best comprehensive effectiveness.",
