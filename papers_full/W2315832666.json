A flexible context\nallows “the activities of one user to be reflected on other users screens and is supported by sharing\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n480\napplication information” [2]. Bentley et al. [2] state that sharing is “the principle means of promoting\ncooperation, and the real-time presentation and manipulation of shared information is the main\nfunction of cooperative, multi-user interfaces”.\nThe objective of this paper is to build flexible context architectures into a multi-user GUI (MUG)\nthat serves several users engaged in collaborative CAx. We have already developed a multi-user client-\nserver collaborative software prototype at BYU called NX Connect. We used the Siemens NX API\n(Application Programming Interface) to extend the single user commercial CAx software to a multi-user\nenvironment where several users can simultaneously construct and edit the same model. NX Connect\ndoes not have a formal multi-user GUI to provide a desired flexible context for the collaborative\nactivities. This paper will extend previous research into multi-user GUI’s by proposing a flexible\ncontext interface for multi-user interaction, and also provide a simple prototype using currently\navailable tools. The investigation will consider how distributed users, through user interfaces, interact\nto simultaneously build models, and how interaction context might be presented to regulate the way\nthey wish to interact.\n2 REVIEW OF MULTI-USER TECHNOLOGIES\nThis section uses six categories to examine previous work: 1) multi-user GUI’s; 2) ideal-user interface; 3)\nclient – server application; 4) existing MUG architectures and infrastructures 5) multi-user awareness\nand agent software; and 6) motivation and challenges\n2.1 Multi-User Interface\nIn a global collaborative design environment there is the need to co-develop parts by designers at\ndifferent geographical locations. Geographical separation makes it difficult to frequently gather\ninvolved parties and departments for a meeting [5]. Sosa notes that even engineers who sit in the same\nroom and work on different parts of the same model create conflicts when they try to assemble the\nparts together [23]. Macfarlane suggests that if engineers start a complicated model on the same\nscreen, they may avoid “no match” situations before assembling the parts [17]. A multi-user\nenvironment challenges system capacity and reveals problems like process collisions [20] among\ncollaborating users in the same space.\nOne example of a multi-user interface is CoMaya [28]. CoMaya converts single-user Maya into a\nreal-time collaboration using Autodesk and Verse tools. CoMaya allows two or more users to\ncollaborate simultaneously to make changes to a single file. The session maintains the original user\ninterface and functionalities of Maya, but adds the CoMaya user interface as well. User A’s actions\nimmediately appear on User B’s workspace in real-time. CoMaya uses target object high-lighting and\nsemantic sound effects [28] to indicate concurrent work. Either of these effects can be applied to the\nsame object and attribute, or to the same object with different attributes. With fast local response,\nusers can modify a part of the model, or navigate different regions of the model, from different\nperspectives.\n2.2 Ideal User-Interface\nAn ideal user-interface (UI) will help a target group easily access the application and reduce the support\ncost. One UI design principle is consistency, which enables the users to “build an accurate mental mode\nof the way it works” and require less training and support costs [31]. Similarly, most collaborative\ndesign companies try to retain the single user interface and add multi-user view windows or view\nsessions.\nAn ideal UI will deliver the messages effectively. Equivalently, an ideal multi-user UI will promote\ncooperation and multi-user interaction. It will provide users with encouragement and help\ncollaboration take place with one user’s awareness of others’ activities. Most existing multi-user\napplications produce the illusion that the users are the only ones in the system. This illusion makes\nthe users unaware of the presence of others and prohibits collaboration. A good way to overcome the\nillusion and enhance multi-user awareness is to establish and maintain a common context. This context\nis communications between users of different cultures and personalities, and “allows the activities of\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n481\none user to be reflected on other users’ screens that are supported by sharing application information”\n[2].\n2.3 Client – Server Application\nThe Client-Server (CS) architecture, also known as a centralized architecture, uses a central server\nprogram to process user input events and display output events which are routed by way of local client\nprograms [2]. This architecture simplifies access management and data consistency. Accordingly, the\ngreat advantage of the CS approach is simplicity. But this architecture does not support end-user\ntailoring, and it is vulnerable to “failure of the central node (server), and delayed feedback as all input\nand output events must travel over a network” [2].\nThe literature considers two CS architectures that enable co-design: thin server/strong clients; and\nstrong server/thin clients. In the former the server exchange and broadcasts CAD information from\none client to client. The server, as a registration system for multi-user application session, acts as a\nmessenger between clients. Clients are “equipped with whole CAD systems and some communication\nfacilitators” [29]. In the latter architecture the server side carries out the major modeling activities\nwith visualized-based manipulation clients [24].\nOur prototype, called NX Connect, is built on a thin server with strong clients. The server acts as a\nmessenger to distribute model changes between collaborating users while maintaining all necessary\ninformation. Each client is equipped with the full CAx application and generates a local copy of the\npart file that can be updated during the design session. Since each client application performs the\ncomputations, a real time multi-user experience is delivered.\n2.4 Existing MUG Architectures and Infrastructures\nMulti-user applications essentially rely on “an underlying distributed communication layer to perform\nmessage passing between computers” [8]. Most of the architectural styles found in multi-user systems\nfollow a philosophy where application data (the model) is kept separate from interface code (the view)\n[15]. Collaboration transparency follows this style. It will not modify the actual application after\ncollaboration support is added to the application [8]. Such systems handle collaboration implicitly and\n“replicate display output and adopt an approach based on sharing the presentation of an application”\n[2]. Therefore these systems give each user “a common frame of reference” or a common context,\nwhich support the What You See Is What I See (WYSIWIS) context [2][15]. However, pure WYSIWIS\nsharing cannot be used on MUG development, especially when multi-users build the same model where\ndifferent tasks need to access shared data. Different users may require “different presentation–level or\nWYSIWIS information sharing” or some of the users may consider all levels of presentations. Richard,\net. al [2] state that collaboration transparency cannot provide this level of flexibility because the system\nis required to exploit knowledge of the shared task undertaken by each user. If that is the case, the\nalternative approach is a collaboration aware application.\nIn contrast to the transparent approach, the collaboration aware application develops special\npurpose applications, which recognize levels of cooperation and handle collaboration explicitly. The\ncollaboration aware application provides facilities to “explicitly manage the sharing of information,”\nallowing sharing to be presented in a range of different ways to different users [2]. This approach often\ndemonstrates how the information is performed and modified within the application, and how the\ndecision of MUG’s management is embedded in the protocol. Furthermore, the collaboration aware\napplications lack a supporting infrastructure and inhibit interface tailoring of sharing policy, which\noften require the developer to conduct the application from scratch [2]. So the transparent approach is\nmore popular for developers to apply to MUG applications.\nBesides the transparency approach and collaboration aware applications, there are other methods\navailable - blackboard architectures and Groupware toolkits widgets. Gelernter, et al. [7] and Martin, et\nal. [16] point out that Blackboard Architectures allow “multiple processes to communicate by reading\nand writing information from a global data store” and provide “a flexible framework for problem\nsolving by a dynamic community distributed process”. Blackboard architectures are “an associative\nmemory with multiple independent cooperating knowledge sources, competing hypotheses, levels of\nabstraction and feedback to the sources” [1]. Another option is Groupware toolkits widgets. Hill, et al.\n[7] suggest that Groupware toolkits provide reusable GUI widgets and communication infrastructure\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n482\ncomponents [10]. It also “integrates with a set of popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE)”\n[10]. The user interface of multi-modal interaction supports multiple forms of interaction, such as a\ncombination of speech and gesture [4][3].\n2.5 Multi-User Awareness and Agent Software\nMulti-user awareness is “the up-to-the-moment understanding of another person’s activities in a group\nenvironment” [10]. This includes “information about who is using the system, where they are working,\nand what they are doing” [10]. Gutwin [8] suggests that multi-user awareness is “an important part of\ncollaborative activity. If workspace awareness is difficult to maintain, collaboration becomes more\ndifficult”.\nAgent software is a popular and effective approach to increase multi-user awareness between\nusers. Researchers have had experience in multi-user interfaces for many years. Liu, et al. [26][18],\npropose that independent agent-based methods be deployed to enhance the multi-media\ncommunication between collaborating personnel. The intelligent agents can apply rules to\ncommunicate among themselves and distribute change information among collaborators.\nP2P (peer to peer) is “any distributed network architecture composed of participants that make a\nportion of their resources (such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth) directly\navailable to other network participants, without the need for central coordination instances (such as\nservers or stable hosts)” [21]. Each site has intelligent agent software to support interaction between\nmultiple users. Agent software can transmit the collaborative network and capture audio and video\nstreams locally for each user; meanwhile another agent might record design changes, and update them\nbetween users based on users’ privileges. Douglas, et al. [6][18], apply an agent-based approach to\nfacilitate real-time interactions between player entities in a P2P game architecture.\nShen[22] proposes Augmented REALITY concepts that display models between the collaborating\nteam members, but only one member has the right to modify the model. Wallace, et al [26][18],\n“discuss a multi-user X window application that associates multi-colored cursor software to time-share\nthe system cursors among all the users.” User conflicts occur without carefully orchestrated\ninteractions [9]. “Multi-cursor ICEWM has allowed multiple users to work on different applications, but\nthe window manager is still time-slicing single system cursors [25][18]”.\n2.6 Motivation and Challenges\nMany of the multi-user GUI’s for the research prototypes that we have identified orchestrate the user\ninteractions, because the interfaces have no flexible means of interpreting the actions among the users,\nor even regulating how they choose to interact. It is one thing to continually update the screens with all\nchanges among users, but it is another thing to investigate what type of change information might be\nuseful among a set of users and to permit the regulation of that data among the users. It is also\nnecessary to provide an informative collaborative environment for multi-users with awareness\ninformation [10]. “Generic, customized, and groupware-specific components” [9] should be contained\nin the MUG.\nCompared to the widgets in a single user interface, distributed communications protocol and the\nrendering and visualization of multi-user data are fairly complex in a multi-user environment. First, a\nmulti-user interface needs to express which user is managing a component. Second, a multi-user\ninterface needs to determine whether a local user or a remote user manipulates the widget [10]. The\nvisualization for remote users is often different from that of local users within a widget [10].\n3 CONTEXTUALLY FLEXIBLE MUG ARCHITECTURE\nThis research has the following objectives:\n1. Investigate and develop architectures for multi-user interfacing of localized and distributed\ncollaborators applying CAx applications, including agent software that can be configured for user\ncontext preference.\n2. Determine how to integrate filters to provide personalized and selective contextual presentation\nof collaborating user interactions. A filter provides a function/algorithm to limit collaborating data\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n483\ninput, to provide a different view of that data, or to promote multi-user awareness. Filters could be\nmapped to Multi-User GUI (MUG) menu items or selection icons, etc.\n3. Develop MUG prototypes that are consistent in look and feel with current commercial CAx GUI’s,\nbut can be invoked or hidden. The intent is to develop software libraries that can be linked to CAx\nAPI libraries, and then eventually become a member of the API library after commercialization by\nthe CAx company. In addition, a prioritization method will be considered that allows manager\noversight of multi-user sessions.\n4. Demonstrate that MUG’s can enhance multi-user CAx; and that product personnel of different\ncultures can navigate CAx collaboration effectively, in spite of cultural differences.\nThe following sections outline the proposed MUG architecture that provides user flexibility to\nconfigure the contexts to meet the interface styles and cultural constraints for each user in a\ncollaborative session. The following sections describe a limited MUG prototype built on current API’s\nand other software to emulate many of the desired features for the objective MUG. We then compare\nthe desired MUG with our prototype to show current limitations in CAx API’s, CAx architectures built\nfor single users, and current computer OS’s and associated networking technologies.\n3.1 MUG Architectural Concepts\nAs an interface layer on top of the CAx application the proposed MUG will separate the model from the\nview as discussed in section 2.4. Contextual changes in a user’s MUG will not affect the application data\ninherent to any Multi-User Software (MUS) used to communicate CAx application data among multi-\nusers. NX Connect is one example of a MUS. The MUG architecture should also be general enough to\nintegrate into multi-user CAx applications regardless of distribution network type, such as CS, P2P,\nhybrid forms of CS and P2P, or cloud serving.\nTab. 1 shows a proposed context list. Multiple icon selection sequences could be used to vary\ncontext preferences for each user in a collaborative session.\nMUG\nOn/Off\nMultiple\nDisplays\nDivided\nDisplay Timer Security\nTokens Emotive Text Transla-\ntion Video Audio Skype Record Super-\nvisor MUG ISM\nTab. 1: MUG contexts.\n3.1.1 Context preferences\nUsers will have a variety of options for communicating with each other under preferred context\nsettings.\nDisplay control contexts - Each user will set a display mode context, which identifies whether user\nremote sessions and their screen displays are to be observed locally, and, if so, how and how often?\nContext preferences will be set by each multi-user to 1) share an entire screen between selected multi-\nusers; 2) share only the CAx workspace screen, not including the GUI; 3) set the timing for refreshing\nmulti-user windows on a user’s local display(s); and 4) if the user is the supervisor, set security tokens\nthat limit the model information transmitted between multi-users. For proprietary reasons each multi-\nuser will have rights, from none to full access, and can block certain aspects of model viewing by other\nmulti-users.\nEffective multi-user display contexts will depend on the related display equipment, being most\neffective in rooms where large multiple displays can be used to mirror the session windows of\nnetworked multi-users. Multi-user display collaboration will be limited on a single display screen,\nunless the display is very large or high resolution projectors are used to partition multi-user sessions\non a large wall screen.\nData compression techniques will be very important to propagating multi-user session display data\namong multiple users, although techniques such as windows terminal sharing and HP’s Remote\nGraphics Software (RGS) clearly demonstrate that network bandwidths are capable of mirroring\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n484\ndistributed terminal displays, also capturing mouse cursor and keyboard events relative to a screen\nlayout.\nCommunication contexts – The proposed MUG will allow multi-users to communicate by 1) video, 2)\naudio/voice, 3) text, and 4) emotive icon. Each user will set communication context preferences, unless\na supervisor overrides the preferences. Video contexts depend on each user having a webcam or other\nvideo source, and enabling it for multi-user viewing. Each user will have the right to specify those\nmulti-users to view, and filter out those not to view, unless supervisor override.\nUsing audio contexts and related equipment (headphones, external microphones, etc.) a multi-user\ncan enable other users to enter an audio session, or allow the user to send voice mail to a multi-user.\nWhen combined with video interfacing, this can be an effective way to exchange production\ninformation and design details. Modern VOIP and Skype applications abound with this capability\nalready. Researchers at BYU have embedded Skype capabilities into a Siemens NX CAx application,\ncalling the prototype NX Skype, but the prototype does not include video collaboration.\nAudio contexts may not be effective when different cultures are collaborating and located in\ndifferent time zones. In this case each user will set a text context that would include no text\ncommunication allowed, or text communications allowed in a language of preference and with a\nnotification context, such as text inbound alert followed by user response, streaming without requiring\nuser response, or a fixed time interval before text viewing or response. In the fixed time interval mode\ntext is buffered for later viewing and response; this mode is important to users located in different\ntime zones. When different cultures are texting, the user can set a translation context which consists of\n1) no translation, show in native language received, or 2) translate into current language preference.\nIcons will provide a way for users to express themselves emotionally, and provide an effective\nrhythmic order for users to visually manage applications and improve awareness in a collaborative\nenvironment. Emotive context preferences will enable users to use emoticons in their communication,\nand to relate them to the audio and texting communications between multi-users. Emoticons within a\nmessage can enhance dialogue and lighten the mood. “Humor and sarcasm don’t come across well in\ntext” [30].\nSupervisory control contexts - A future MUG will provide organizational contexts, by providing both\na teaching context and a management context. In the teaching context a supervisor/instructor can\nremote control another user’s cursor while tutoring the user. A supervisor can also assign tutor\nauthority to any multi-user team member under restrictions, such as limiting the power distance [11].\nA supervisor will be able to limit multi-user model access, including team participation scope, and\nparticipating timelines. Some participants will only access part of the team resources while others may\nhave full access. The supervisor will be able to delete a user’s account or change the user’s role on a\nteam.\nSecurity contexts – Although mentioned earlier, security contexts will allow supervisors to set the\ncollaborative access rights to CAx application model data. Extending participation rights to supply\nchain personnel who can identify current problems in obtaining material resources, or supply chain\nlimitations in globally distributed design and manufacturing facilities, will counter potential resource\nproblems early on.\nRecording context – The proposed MUG architecture recognizes the importance of multi-user CAx\nfor generating product development histories, including critical design and manufacturing intent and\ndecisions. This information is almost impossible to attain/maintain in the current single user\napplication interfaces. Thus, each MUG user will set a record context to record or not record multi-user\nsession data, along with several contextual preferences to designate which of the communication\nmeans are to be recorded: audio, text, emoticons, etc. It is assumed that the MUS application will\nrecord the CAx model changes and maintain a master product model.\n3.1.2 MUG modules\nA MUG is broken into two modules: MUG Client Application (MUG CAPP) and a MUG Information\nStorage Module (MUG ISM). Each multi-user applies a CAPP to program and regulate the interaction with\nother multi-users logged into an application session. A CAPP will be deployed differently depending on\nthe network type: CS, P2P, or cloud, but the basic functionality will not change. The ISM functions to\nstore critical user authorization information, e.g., each user’s technical background and cultural\ninformation, at a critical location server.\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n485\nThe CAPP provides tools and a GUI to serve two primary functions: 1) program and store\ncontextual preferences for multi-user collaboration; and 2) transmit, receive, and store session data\npropagated between multi-users. Common terms used to describe the tools used are MUG filters and\nMUG agent software, respectively. A MUG filter is any method, such as a widget application, used to set\nthe flexible context state, whereas agent software can be configured to package and transmit multi-\nuser session data, according to the current filters set by the user. This data would include user\ncontexts, user awareness information (there/not there, active/not active, session type, security\nrestrictions, etc.), filtered application data packets (what application data is transmitted and viewable;\ne.g., some users may be restricted to viewing only a subset of a design assembly), and network\ncommunication speed/stability data.\nOther widgets will expand the preference settings. For example, A Radar View Widget can reflect a\nsingle user’s activities on other user screens. A Text Widget can provide text display and allow users to\ndisplay and edit texts. A Translator Widget can bring real-time, in-place translating services. A security\nkey widget can ensure all files are transferred in a secure environment.\nEach user will use their GUI CAPP to connect to other users. The user information data is stored by\nthe MUG Information Storage Module and can be quickly accessed by other users’ MUG. The number of\nnew features for managing interaction contexts will increase with advances in collaborative networks\nand collaborative CAx applications.\nThe MUG Information Storage Module will store authorization information and user identification\ninformation. This module interfaces to the MUG CAPP of each client and stores or retrieves data as\nneeded by the client’s MUG CAPP. The module stores MUG context–related information and organizes\ndata types and user information. The MUG architecture is general enough to be distributed in several\nnetwork architectures: 1) CS; 2) P2P; or 3) cloud server.\n3.1.3 MUG in CS mode\nFig. 1 shows how the proposed MUG components are deployed over the Server and Client when multi-\nusers engage in a collaborative Multi-User Software (MUS) application. Presently, MUS prototype\nsoftware such as NX Connect acts as an application layer on top of single user CAx applications, where\nAPI calls are used to observe, record, and transmit data modifications among multi-users. Future\nversions of CAx applications will integrate this functionality directly into a CAx application interface.\nA server will include both the MUG ISM and the MUS ISM. But at each client computer, a MUS\nController will convert design modification information into primitive values and transmit them to the\nSERVER\nMUG INFORMATION STORAGE MODULE\nMUS INFORMATION STORAGE MODULE\nCLIENT A\nMUG CAPP\nMUS CONTROLLER CAx\nCLIENT B\nMUG CAPP\nMUS CONTROLLER CAx\nCLIENT C\nMUG CAPP\nMUS CONTROLLER CAx\nFig. 1: MUG architecture in CS mode.\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n486\nMUS ISM. The data will be stored and transmitted to multi-users according to permission and context\nsettings. At each user station the CAx application will construct corresponding features in their CAx\napplication, depending on the permission settings for each user and the desired contexts.\nThere are some important questions still to be answered. Where should user context filters and\npermission filters be applied - at the user computer, at the server, or at both? Should all multi-user\nsession data be sent to the server, where each user’s context and security filters can be stored and thus\napplied? This method permits all multi-user and application data to be recorded at a single server,\nenhancing session security, and minimizing data hacking at a user’s computer, but will certainly\nincrease data network density and server data storage requirements. Conversely, applying filters at\neach user’s computer to strip down the data packets will mandate more sophisticated and localized\nsecurity software to protect proprietary data from unauthorized viewing/storing, but minimize the\ndata to be sent.\nThe MUS controller function is critical. If data capture and data synchronization in the controller\nare mainly processed at the client side, as shown in Fig. 1, a CS with a thin server and strong client will\nbe utilized. If the data related to multi-user activities are computed on the server side, a strong server\nwith thin clients will be utilized.\n3.1.4 MUG in P2P mode\nFig. 2 shows how the MUG components could be deployed in the P2P mode. Peers will function as both\nclients and servers to other peers as shown in Fig. 2. MUS and MUG ISM’s will reside in each peer\ncomputer and be linked to each other in the overlay network. Each peer will employ an interfacing\nprotocol or flood through the network to route a search to other peers for multi-user session data. In\nP2P networks, once a network opens up to the public domain, users begin to access a portion of\nresources. The more peers that join the network, the more resources become available to each peer.\nThis may cause team-shared files to be unsecured.\nFor example, an ideal P2P architecture may not be secure for the data storage requirements of a\ncomplex CAx collaboration. It seems there has to be a central infrastructure node, which serves to\nenforce security and store the “master changes”, even though the MUS and MUG are deployed over all\nthe peers. This central node might be a supervisor’s peer computer or any other peer computer so\ndesignated.\nIn an ideal P2P case all data is passed among the users and filtered at each peer computer,\nincluding sensitive data that should not be viewed by all multi-users. The central node infrastructure,\nwhich deviates from the ideal P2P, would store sensitive data in the central node and not allow it to be\nPEER\nMUS AND MUG ISM\nMUS CONTROL\nMUG CAPP\nPEER\nMUS AND MUG ISM\nMUS CONTROL\nMUG CAPP\nPEER\nMUS AND MUG ISM\nMUS CONTROL\nMUG CAPP\nPEER\nMUS AND MUG ISM\nMUS CONTROL\nMUG CAPP\nCentral\nNode\nFig. 2: MUG architecture in P2P mode.\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n487\ngenerally distributed to the peer computers. Each peer could then remotely access this data but not\nmake a copy in the local machine. The central node will pass and filter the regular data as other peers\nbut have a higher data storage requirement to process and store sensitive data.\n3.1.5 MUG in cloud serving mode\nThe MUG ISM and MUS ISM will be stored on several virtual servers hosted on a large data center\nlabeled as “Database” in Fig. 3. MUG CAPP and MUS applications will be stored in cloud application\nservers that are labeled as “Application Servers”.\nTypically “Application Servers” have many blades, each of which can host applications. “Central\nNodes” in the figure will be programmed to monitor the network traffic and administer the system to\nmake sure everything runs properly by reporting event information through the collector component\nto the server. Protocol and Middleware used in “Central Nodes” will set rules and maintain\ncommunications among the computers in a network. “Server Blades” will handle all the heavy workload\ngenerated by the running applications. Client computers functioning as display terminals will access\nMUS and MUG applications remotely through interface software like Remote Graphics Software (RGS).\nWhere a MUS application is replicated for each client, a MUG would also be replicated for each client.\nMulti-user clients see the same application interfaces in cloud serving as they see in CS architectures.\nAn interface like RGS is used to connect client computers and blade servers shown in Fig. 4. RGS\nsends user mouse and keyboard events from client computers to blade workstations. These events will\nbe interpreted by RGS software and processed by the applications on the blade servers. A modified\nServer Blades Control nodes\nApplication Servers\nIncludes MUG CAPP\nand MUS Controller\nDatabase: Includes MUG ISM &\nMUS ISM\nFig. 3: MUG architecture in cloud serving mode.\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n488\nmulti-user RGS environment would transmit the interactive desktop images running on blade\nworkstations to client computers via a TCP/IP network.\nThe Session Allocation Manager (SAM) optimizes the deployment of client/application sessions\namong the blade servers. Presently SAM only allows the user to log into SAM once or establish a re-\nconnection to the user’s previous remote computing resources. SAM also manages connections\nbetween client computers and remote computing resources (like Siemens NX, MUG CAPP, MUS\ncontroller, etc.). The database in SAM will store the properties of the computing resources, client\ncomputers and RGS and will determine how to allocate user requests based on the computing\nresources.\nFig. 4: RGS architecture (Source: HP Website).\nSecurity will be enhanced due to the centralization of data, and the performance will be monitored\nand scalable. But users will lose control of local data and the performance of CAx applications will be\ngreatly influenced by high network load or low bandwidth.\n3.1.6 Agent software\nAgent software is programmed to specify how one user interacts with other users and exhibits a high\ndegree of autonomy. It is configured to observe, record, and transmit user actions among a set of\ncollaborators. Intelligent agents apply rules to communicate among themselves and distribute change\ninformation among collaborators [18]. In the proposed MUG architecture the agent software uses the\ncontext settings to determine what information is to be transmitted. Again, an issue to be resolved in\nthe future, and which depends somewhat on resources, is whether the agent software strips the data\npackets locally, depending on context settings, or whether the agent software transmits the context\nsettings to a server to strip the packet.\nThe advantages of agent software are: 1) simplifying the complexities of distributed computing\nand 2) overcoming the limitations of current user interface approaches, such as speed of performance,\nerror rates, and retention over time [12]. Agent software will periodically check if any information has\nbeen changed and then broadcast updates to all users.\nThe agent interface can receive a query regarding the collaboration environment, such as context\nsettings for an on-line user, and report the query results to the users shown in Fig. 5. In the CS mode a\nregional server, at some remote location, receives requests from the interface agent software and\ncollaboratively responds to the request.\nServers\nBlade\nPC’s\nVirtual Desk-\ntop\nInfrastructure\nClient\nComputer\nClient\nComputer\nClient\nComputer\nSAM\nRGS\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n489\nOne useful feature of agent software is to integrate video and audio streaming systems that can be\nbroadcast to the set of collaborating users in a MUG. The agent software may use any of the\narchitectures previously discussed, such as the P2P and CS architectures. CS can handle account\nmanagement and present status information. P2P is used for in-band real-time streaming data that\nincludes audio, video, and text messaging. It is scalable and robust because the removal of nodes has\nno great impact on the network.\nA future MUG will display the context filters described previously. As an example, consider text\ntranslation. A user can use a filter widget to pre-set the native language of choice, type in that\nlanguage, and based on the communication and security contexts, allow agent software at each user’s\ndisplay to translate the texts into the native language set for each user.\n4 MUG PROTOTYPE CONSIDERATIONS\nIn this section we configure our prototype, considering the limitations in current CAx API’s and other\ntools that are available.\n4.1 CAD API\nA CAx application provides API’s to extend the design environment, enabling engineers to design and\nproduce better products. Zhou et al. [27][14] used “the APIs of multiple CAD systems in order to\ndevelop a CAD neutral module which will be able to interact with the different commercial CAD\npackages enabling more collaborative design efforts to take place.” Kao and Lin [13][14] used “the CAD\nAPI to pass model information over a LAN as well as the Internet as part of a collaborative CAD/CAM\nsystem in development.”\nA CAD API also helps the system extend capability and compatibility. Tucker’s research involved\nthe development of an API translator, which was able to convert API functions and code from one CAD\nsystem into functions and code for another system. Tucker’s research demonstrates a partial solution\nto “a pervasive problem in CAD which is the collaboration and file sharing between groups or\ncompanies which use different CAD packages” [14]. He developed an API translator, which was able to\nconvert API code and function for one CAD system into code and functions for another CAD system. It\nis important to design an adaptable and user-friendly platform. We suggest that a future MUG would\ndevelop a collaborative library that could be integrated into the API of any commercial CAx API library.\nQuery\nAgent\ninterface\nReport\nRegional\nServer\nRegional\nServer\nRegional\nServer\nFig. 5: Agent software workflow.\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n490\n4.2 NX Connect\nNX Connect is an add-on MUS to Siemens NX and allows multiple users to access and make changes to\na single part file simultaneously. It is a collaborative CS prototype without a multi-user MUG; thus, all\ncollaborative activities in NX Connect have to be orchestrated. Before building an NX MUG as a\ndemonstration prototype, we need to understand how the NX Connect application is limited by the\nSiemens NX architecture and related API.\n4.3 Limitations of Siemens NX\nThere are a number of limitations in Siemens NX that can be related to single user architectures. These\nlimitations would be present in most CAx application API’s.\n1. There is no direct access to the event handler; undo marker files are utilized to access model\nparameter changes in a multi-user environment.\n2. API’s provide handles to geometric objects (memory addresses). These cannot be passed to other\nmulti-users since memory locations on each computer vary. Thus, NX Connect required extensive\nprogramming to extract the parameters from the data structures. CAx applications inherently\nknow how to pass geometry parameters because they generate files that conform to IGES/STEP\nstandards for neutral file exchange. Multi-user CAx will need API’s that provide the parameters\ndirectly, like copying the object, rather than just memory addresses to the object.\n3. CAx applications have a concept of a single display screen, a single viewpoint, and a single cursor.\nThe NX GUI’s are built for single users and are not intended to be shared by multi-users. Only one\nuser can modify the model at one time, regardless of how many are viewing the display screen.\nUsers cannot simultaneously view the model from different viewpoints or simultaneously edit the\nmodel parameters in the same GUI.\n4. There are no event interrupts available that signal parameter changes inside NX. NX Connect polls\nfor parameter changes from undo marker files. Although polling is simple, it would be more\nefficient to replace polling with interrupts. The interrupt will be raised only when the new update\noccurs. Furthermore, busy-wait polling is perfectly appropriate in a simple single-purpose system,\nbut in a multi-tasking system, especially in real-time computing, interrupts are preferred [32].\nInterrupts can keep the computer from busy-wait polling, then switch a context to an interrupt\nhandler. Interrupts make it easy to add new functions such as a sound alert when the server\nreceives a new update and sends it to each client.\n4.4 Network considerations\nIn CS architectures where the CAx application resides locally on each PC (or workstation), screen\nupdates will only be as effective as the network speeds, and may be affected by network latencies and\nreliability issues. LAN networks within companies will generally be fast. Image rendering within\ncompany network infrastructures will likely be very effective and allow multiple personnel from\ndisparate organizations to collaborate.\nMulti-user groups that are globally distributed may have to use buffering methods to update\nchanges periodically, rather than attempt real-time screen updates. The proposed MUG allows users to\nset timing contexts and thus CS architectures should support multi-user collaboration effectively in the\nnear future.\nA cloud serving architecture will also depend on network latencies, and may be ineffective across\nwidely distributed global networks, unless the cloud servers are also distributed and updated\naccordingly using update timers and buffers. Cloud serving collaboration will be very effective in local\ninfrastructure networks, and provide for enhanced security.\nSoftware like RGS minimizes the information to be transmitted from the user station to the cloud\nserver, since only the screen pixels, mouse cursor, and keyboard events need to be transmitted.\nCompressing/decompressing algorithms at the client and in the cloud minimize the data packets to get\nrealistic performance.\nIf NX Connect and the prototype MUG are distributed in a cloud, using RGS display updating\nmethods, the current thin-server-thick-client CS architecture will be dramatically changed. This\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n491\narchitecture will make the data more secure and a centralized architecture will reduce management\ncosts by consolidating resources to one-point management.\n5 NX MUG PROTOTYPE\nThe objective of our MUG prototype is to assist users to communicate with each other through NX\nConnect when multiple users are making changes to a single model; see Fig. 6. NX MUG uses agent\nsoftware to connect to NX Connect and the multi-user clients. To link NX Connect to NX MUG the\nprogramming codes were placed so that NX MUG is invoked right before entering multi-user mode.\nThis action assures that NX MUG and NX Connect use the same server and serve the same group of\nclients. User awareness data and filters are set in each client’s MUG.\nA client’s display window is captured by continually calling Windows system API at a fixed\nfrequency, capturing screen images (or workspace images), and grabbing the mouse movements. The\nmouse is drawn on the images and saved in bmp format; the images are compressed through the\ncompression algorithm and are converted into jpg format. Then the captured images are transmitted\nover the network as a byte (input/output) stream. Clients receive the data packages in a byte stream\nand assemble them to a JPEG file. Finally, these images are displayed in the client’s MUG video window.\nChat messages are transmitted via UDP sockets, first stored as a data I/O packet that includes\nother authentication information. The client software will extract the data and display the text\nmessages in the client’s MUG. The alert function has two modes, a broadcasting mode and an alert\nmode. In the broadcasting mode a message is sent to the server and the server forwards the message\nto inform all clients to submit the update information. In the alert mode an alert is sent to the target\nperson in the group, which is similar to the principle of sending chat messages in the form of packets.\nThe translation tool is implemented by polling Google Translator through custom developed C#\nweb-based tools. The SKYPE function linked to the program was written by another graduate student\n[19]. He integrated Skype in NX.\nFig. 6: NX MUG prototype architecture\n\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n492\nThe multi-user functions are controlled by the MUG CAPP. The server only plays an interactive role,\nwhich is responsible for reading the corresponding information from the ISM database for CurrentUser\nand CurrentUserProfile. The server interacts with the clients to control user login and registration,\nincluding distributing user status, establishing UDP connection for different clients, and broadcasting\nany user’s updated information.\n5.1 NX MUG Implementation\nThree participants collaborated in the demonstration, and spent some time coordinating and\ndecomposing their tasks beforehand. They logged in as John, Lu and April and the group collaborated\nto design a turbine engine front frame that required multiple features.\nIn the figures below, John started to sketch the inner ring and asked April if she finished the first\nsketch in XY plane at origin.\nApril responded to John that she just finished the sketch and would start a revolve 360 degrees\nabout the x-axis.\nApril wanted to watch John’s screen to make sure there was no intersection of their respective\nparts. John accepted her request and gave April full screen access.\nMeanwhile, April was checking other user profiles. John wanted to watch Lu’s workspace and Lu\naccepted John’s request as shown later.\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n493\nLater April sent John a text requesting that she be able to view his workspace.\nJohn changed his view setting based on April’s request. Then, April sent a request to watch Lu’s\nscreen.\nBut Lu was in the middle of editing the model, and he refused April’s request. Later, April asked Lu\nabout his progress and she typed and sent the message -“hey how is your progress” in her native\nlanguage (English) to Lu.\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n494\nLu received the message and translated it into Chinese, Lu’s native language, using Google Transla-\ntor accessed through the MUG.\nShortly thereafter, April sent several text messages to Lu and Lu used the Google Translator. He\nfigured that it might be easier to understand April’s intent using the remote view.\nLater, April sent an alert to Lu and John and notified them that the model had appeared to be fi-\nnished. April decided to conclude the session using a video chat rather than texting, and each of\nthem evoked Skype through NX MUG as shown in Fig. 8.\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n495\nTab. 2: NX MUG demo.\nFig. 8: Skype session.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nA future NX MUG will be capable of all the current prototype features, plus those that follow, assuming\nthat future CAx applications will be modified to incorporate these capabilities: 1) integrate some MUS\ncapability or provide API interfaces to an integrated MUS; and 2) provide direct access through CAx API\nto event buffer, using interrupts to notify when parameter changes occur and allowing API’s to copy\nthe data object if necessary. It is also presumed that display communication software like RGS can be\nmodified for multi-user interaction/awareness. In conclusion:\n NX MUG can run as application concurrently with CAx application or will have API set for direct in-\ntegration into CAx applications, where CAx has some MUS capability.\n NX MUG architecture will allow it to be used in CS, hybrid P2P, or cloud serving modes.\n NX MUG will apply security measures to restrict/manage collaboration between users (what models\nthey can view, change, copy, etc.). This will require some interfacing between the NX MUG applica-\ntion and the CAx MUS.\n Future NX MUG can set all the contexts discussed in the paper, including display control contexts,\ncommunication contexts, supervisory control contexts, security contexts, and recording contexts.\n NX MUG integrates auto text translation so that each user communicates in a language prefe-\nrence/context.\n Users set up multi-user display sessions, partitioned on one screen or over multiple displays.\nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 8(4), 2011, 479-497\n© 2011 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n496\n7 REFERENCES\n[1] Bahill, T.: Applications of Blackboard Architecture, systems and industrial engineering, Universi-\nty of Arizona, 1997.\n[2] Bentley, R.; Roden, T.; Sawyer, P; Sommerville, I.: Architectural Support for Cooperative Multi-user\nInterfaces, Computing Department, Lancaster University, 1994.\n[3] Coutaz, J.; Nigay, L.; Salber, D.; Blandford, A.; May, J.; Young, R.: Four Easy Pieces for Assessing\nthe Usability of Multimodal Interaction: The CARE properties, Proceedings of the INTERACT'95\nconference, S.
