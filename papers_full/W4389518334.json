Our experiments are based\non two popular bias evaluation datasets, Stere-\noSet and CrowS-Pairs, and we perform a layer-\nby-layer analysis using the Logit Lens.\n1 Introduction\nMotivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nrisen to prominence, revolutionizing the field of\nnatural language processing (NLP). These models,\nsuch as OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) and LLaMA (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023a), are trained on vast and diverse\ndata sources encompassing webpages, Wikipedia,\nbooks, scientific papers, and other online content.\nWhile this broad spectrum of data ensures a rich\nrepresentation of the world’s knowledge, it also\nserves as a double-edged sword. On one side, it\nrepresents a democratic and diverse range of ideas,\nyet on the flip side, it exposes the models to inher-\nent social biases.\nIn recent years, the NLP community has prior-\nitized studying biases in LLMs. Early work by\nBolukbasi et al. (2016) revealed gender and eth-\nnic biases in word embeddings like Word2Vec and\nGloVe. This trend of identifying biases continued\nwith more complex models like BERT, where re-\nsearchers examined how biases are encoded and\npropagated (Kurita et al., 2019; May et al., 2019).\nResearchers have also developed datasets, such\nas StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021) and CrowS-\nPairs (Nangia et al., 2020), specifically to mea-\nsure and understand these biases. Sap et al. (2020)\ndelved into the effects of biased data, especially\nfrom human annotators, on the behavior of mod-\nels. Alongside identification, efforts have been\ngeared towards the mitigation of bias in LLMs.\nTechniques such as iterative nullspace projection\n(INLP) (Ravfogel et al., 2020a) and Counterfactual\nData Augmentation (CDA) (Zmigrod et al., 2019)\nhave been proposed and implemented to mitigate\nbiases in LLMs. Nevertheless, many of the exist-\ning studies have examined and evaluated biases in\nLLMs in a more coarse-grained manner, and it is\nunclear how the debiasing techniques affected the\nLLMs in deeper neural layers.\nWe aim to address this research gap by con-\nducting an in-depth analysis to interpret layer-wise\nbias in pretrained LLMs. Interpretability in LLMs\nhas gained significant attention due to the implica-\ntions of understanding and explaining model deci-\nsions. Prior research has leveraged techniques such\nas attention visualization (Vaswani et al., 2017),\nLIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016), and SHAP (Lund-\nberg and Lee, 2017) to uncover feature significance.\nIntegrated Gradients, introduced by Sundararajan\net al. (2017), offers insights into how deep learning\nmodels relate predictions to input features, thereby\nilluminating their decision paths. Another ground-\nbreaking tool is the Logit Lensby nostalgebraist\n(2020). It reveals that when the hidden states of\neach GPT-2 layer (Radford et al.) are decoded\nwith the unembedding matrix, the ensuing distri-\nbutions consistently narrow down, leading to the\nmodel’s final output. This approach has paved the\nway for recent research, with studies employing\n285\nLogit Lens to interpret transformer weight matri-\nces (Halawi et al., 2023; Dar et al., 2023; Geva\net al., 2022). Building on these foundations, we\nadapt Logit Lens in our pursuit to unravel biases\nacross the layers of pretrained LLMs.\nContributions:\nOverall, we make two main research contribu-\ntions. 1) We perform extensive experiments to\ninvestigate how the different type of bias evolves\nacross the neural layers in LLMs. Specifically, we\nfound that while different types of biases (e.g., gen-\nder and religion) exhibit different bias-evolving\ntrends in the LLMs’ neural layers, the bias gen-\nerally increases starting from the first layer with\nthe peaks in later layers. 2) We evaluate the ef-\nfectiveness of de-biasing techniques on LLMs by\ninterpreting the fine-grained debiasing effects on\nLLMs’ intermediate layers. All our experiments\nare conducted on three recent and popular LLMs -\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), LLaMA (Touvron et al.,\n2023a), and LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b). We\nevaluate the three LLMs on three benchmarking\ndatasets that are commonly used in bias studies.\n2 Related Work\n2.1 Bias in Natural Language Processing\nBias studies in the domain of NLP can be broadly\nclassified based on various criteria. One criterion\nis the specific type of bias being studied. For in-\nstance, research by (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao\net al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019) focuses on gender-\noccupation biases. In contrast, the StereoSet bench-\nmark (Nadeem et al., 2021) addresses biases related\nto gender, profession, race, and religion. More-\nover, the CrowS-Pairs benchmark (Nangia et al.,\n2020) extends this to include biases related to sex-\nual orientation, age, nationality, disability, physical\nappearance, and socioeconomic status.\nAnother criterion relates to the methodology em-\nployed for bias identification. Some studies, such\nas those by (Sheng et al., 2019; Gehman et al.,\n2020; Dhamala et al., 2021; Kirk et al., 2021;\nNozza et al., 2021), employ open-ended text gener-\nation. They use prompts like \"The woman works\nas\" and then measure bias either via a specially\ntrained classifier or by using off-the-shelf tools.\nConversely, benchmarks like StereoSet gauge bias\nby calculating the probability of generating specific\nwords or sequences.\nThe granularity of bias detection—whether bias\nis discerned at the token or phrase level—is an-\nother critical differentiation (Liang et al., 2021).\nFurthermore, there are benchmarks that utilize a\nquestion-answer format, like Unqover (Li et al.,\n2020) and BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022). These bench-\nmarks assess whether a model’s response to a given\ncontext and question is biased. They operate in two\nprimary settings. The first is where the context is\nunder-informative; in such cases, a model’s pref-\nerence for a biased answer indicates the existence\nof bias. The second setting provides an adequately\ninformative context, testing whether a model’s in-\nherent bias would choose a biased response over a\ncorrect, anti-stereotypical one.\nIn our work, we have integrated both the Stere-\noSet and CrowS-Pairs benchmarks to encompass a\nwide spectrum of social biases. To ensure compre-\nhensive coverage, we have also included prompts\nfrom (Mattern et al., 2022), addressing any po-\ntential shortcomings of the aforementioned bench-\nmarks.\n2.2 Language model debiasing\nDe-biasing techniques in NLP have gained trac-\ntion, with one prevailing method being the aug-\nmentation of training datasets with counterfactual\nattributes. For example a model can be de-biased\nagainst gender-occupation stereotypes by creating\na counterfactual dataset that swaps gender pro-\nnouns in occupation-related sequences. Notably,\nRanaldi et al. (2023) implemented Counterfactual\nData Augmentation (CDA) using the LoRA (Hu\net al., 2021) adapter training on the PANDA dataset\n(Qian et al., 2022).\nAn alternative approach aims to obfuscate target\nattributes (e.g., gender or race) in learned represen-\ntations. A classic example of this method is (Boluk-\nbasi et al., 2016)’s proposal to de-bias word embed-\ndings concerning gender. They determined a gen-\nder direction in the embedding space by employing\npredefined gender pairs (e.g., he-she, woman-man)\nand then applied PCA, capitalizing on the first prin-\ncipal component for debiasing. Building on this,\n(Ravfogel et al., 2020b) advanced the technique\nby iteratively learning the directions, eliminating\nthe dependence on predefined pairs. Furthermore,\n(Liang et al., 2021) expanded this method to de-\nbias pretrained LLMs like BERT and GPT-2.\nAnother intriguing method is \"self-debiasing\" as\nproposed by (Schick et al., 2021). Instead of alter-\ning the model fundamentally, this approach lever-\nages the pretrained model’s inherent comprehen-\n286\nsion of biases. Specifically, templates are used for\neach undesired attribute in the output, pushing the\nmodel towards biased behavior. By contrasting the\noutput distributions derived with and without the\ntemplates, probabilities of biased tokens are then\nadjusted using a scaling parameter. However, it’s\nessential to note that this method doesn’t genuinely\nmodify the model’s biased tendencies, leaving po-\ntential avenues for the model to be manipulated\ninto exhibiting bias. In our research, we adopt the\nCDA technique for debiasing, as its effectiveness\nhas been demonstrated on LLMs, particularly by\n(Ranaldi et al., 2023).\n2.3 Interpretability\nAs LLMs are often perceived as \"black boxes\",\nthere is an increasing drive to understand the mech-\nanisms underlying their predictions, particularly\nwithin the transformer layers. (V oita et al., 2019)\ndelves into the hidden representations across the\nlayers of transformer models, studying them un-\nder various training objectives. On the other hand,\n(Geva et al., 2022) interprets token representation\nas a continually changing distribution over the vo-\ncabulary. They perceive the output from each Feed-\nForward Network (FFN) layer as an incremental\nupdate to this distribution, which can further be dis-\nsected into sub-updates, each emphasizing specific\nconcepts. Nostalgebraist’s \"logit lens\" approach\nsheds light on the evolution of representations af-\nter each FFN layer (nostalgebraist, 2020). The\nresearcher points out that the dimensionality re-\nmains consistent throughout the residual stream,\nand when projected onto the vocabulary space, it’s\nevident that by the middle layers, the model already\nhas a strong inclination of the output token. Sub-\nsequent layers appear to fine-tune these initial in-\nferences. Notably, this examination was conducted\non GPT-2. In our research, we harness the logit\nlens approach to scrutinize the OPT and LLaMA\nmodel families against bias benchmarks. Our find-\nings spotlight distinct patterns spanning the layers\nconcerning various biases.\n3 Experimental Setup\nIn this section, we outline the crucial elements\nof our experimental analysis. We begin by dis-\ncussing the benchmark datasets. This is followed\nby an overview of the LLMs used in our exper-\niments. Lastly, we delve into the debiasing and\ninterpretability techniques applied to the LLMs.\nDataset Size\nStereoSet\n(Intrasentence) 8,498 contexts\nCrowS-Pairs 1,508 pairs\nOccupational\nGender Bias\n(20 male + 20 female\ndominated jobs) x 4 prompts\nTable 1: Dataset Statistics.\n3.1 Benchmark Datasets\nStereoSet: This dataset is built from crowd-\nsourced context sentences like “The chess player\nwas [BLANK].” Each sentence has three versions:\n(i) Stereotypical (e.g., “The chess player was\nAsian.”). (ii) Anti-stereotypical (e.g., “The chess\nplayer was Hispanic.”). (iii) Unrelated (e.g., “The\nchess player was a fox.”). In addition to this,\nthe authors introduce an \"intersentence\" setting\nfor phrase-level bias measurement. For our study,\nwe use the \"intrasentence\" setting, which utilizes\nthe [BLANK] template sentences mentioned above.\nThe “stereotype score” (ss) calculates the percent-\nage of instances where the model prefers the stereo-\ntypical version over the anti-stereotypical one. We\nalso compute a “language modeling score” (lms),\nwhich represents the percentage of times the model\nopts for either the stereotypical or anti-stereotypical\nsentence over the unrelated one. Ideally, ss and lms\nvalues should be 50 and 100, respectively.\nCrowsourced Stereotype Pairs (CrowS-Pairs):\nThis dataset emphasizes stereotypes related to his-\ntorically disadvantaged groups in the United States.\nIt presents pairs of sentences that have minimal dif-\nferences: the first embodies a stereotype, while the\nsecond counters it. The scoring for these samples\nutilizes the ss metric discussed earlier.\nOccupational Gender Bias (OGB): As high-\nlighted by (Mattern et al., 2022), datasets like Stere-\noSet, which are based on context alignment, can\noffer bias estimations that are influenced by sen-\ntence phrasing. To address this, the authors sug-\ngest a more robust method to assess bias within\noccupation-gender associations. This involves us-\ning prompts exclusively for predicting subsequent\nwords. The methodology introduces both explicit\nand implicit templates, evaluating a model’s incli-\nnation towards gender-specific terms. It involves a\nlist of templates to be filled by a profession word\nfrom separate lists of male and female dominated\njob types. We call the sentences created this way,\nOccupational Gender Bias (OGB)dataset. We also\n287\nadopt the OGB approach in our experimental anal-\nysis. Our analysis accumulates results from all\nprompts to gauge the model’s gender preference\nconcerning male and female-dominated job types.\nTable 1 provides the statistical summary of the\nthree datasets.\n3.2 Large Language Models\nSome prominent LLMs, like GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\n2020) and PALM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), are\nnot open-sourced, and their considerable size poses\nchallenges for experimentation, given our resource\nconstraints. Instead, our study focuses on widely\nrecognized open-sourced LLMs: Large Language\nModel Meta AI (LLaMA) (Touvron et al., 2023a)\nand Open Pre-Trained Transformer Language Mod-\nels (OPT) (Zhang et al., 2022). These models come\nin diverse scales, ranging from approximately 7\nbillion to 70 billion parameters. Notably, they\nhave demonstrated performance on par with, or\neven surpassing, more sizable models like GPT-3\nacross various benchmarks. LLaMA also has a re-\ncent iteration, LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b),\navailable in comparable sizes. Our experiments\nutilize LLaMA_7b, LLaMA_13b, LLaMA-2_7b,\nLLaMA-2_13b, OPT_6.7b, and OPT_13b.\nOwing to resource limitations, we load these\nmodels using float16 precision. Our debiasing ef-\nforts are centered on the OPT_6.7b, LLaMA_7b,\nand LLaMA-2_7b models. For the CDA debiasing\ntechnique, we employ the PANDA (Qian et al.,\n2022) perturbed dataset and the LoRA training\nmethod, as recommended by (Ranaldi et al., 2023).\n3.3 Debiasing and Interpretability\nTechnniques\nQian et al. (2022) introduced the Perturbation Aug-\nmentation NLP DAtaset (PANDA), developed by\nperturbing natural sentences. An example of this\nperturbation is transforming “women like shopping”\nto “men like shopping”. The dataset comprises\n98k pairs, focusing on demographic terms related\nto gender, ethnicity, and age. Language models\nfine-tuned on PANDA have been shown to exhibit\nreduced bias.\nHu et al. (2021) demonstrated that by integrating\nrank decomposition into transformer layer weight\nmatrices, significant parameter savings can be\nachieved without compromising task performance.\nThis decomposition technique (LoRA) has been\nemployed successfully for bias mitigation in LLMs,\nas validated by (Ranaldi et al., 2023). In our work,\nwe apply LoRA to fine-tune the LLMs with the\nPANDA dataset. Specifically, we apply the LoRA\ndecomposition to the query and value matrices\nacross all attention blocks of the transformer, keep-\ning other parameters constant.\nThe architecture of both LLaMA and OPT mod-\nels comprises an embedding layer, 32 decoder lay-\ners, and a concluding unembedding layer. The em-\nbedding matrix maps each input token to a fixed-\ndimension (4096) representation. As this repre-\nsentation progresses through layers, it maintains\nits dimensionality. The final unembedding matrix\nthen transforms this representation into vocabulary\nspace. By obtaining logits from this transformation\nand applying a softmax function, we get a proba-\nbility distribution over the vocabulary. The Logits\nLens (nostalgebraist, 2020) technique utilizes the\nunembedding matrix to map intermediate represen-\ntations back into this vocabulary space.\n4 Bias Analyses\nResearch on bias has largely examined the overall\ntendencies of models to display biased behavior.\nGiven that humans can manifest bias in myriad\nlinguistic expressions, and LLMs are becoming\nincreasingly proficient at replicating human lan-\nguage, the benchmarks used in these studies might\nnot capture the full spectrum of bias due to their\nfixed sentence structures. With this in mind, we\naim for a more nuanced understanding of bias in\nthese models. Our study seeks to address two pri-\nmary questions:\n• R1: How does this bias progress through the\nLLMs’ layers, and does debiasing influence\nthis progression across different layers?\n• R2: What is the aggregate effect of debiasing\non various forms of biases?\n4.1 How does bias evolve across layers in the\nlanguage models?\nWe employ the Logit Lens to explore how bias\ndevelops across the various layers of our models.\nFigure 1 presents the ss values across layers us-\ning the StereoSet dataset. Similar visualizations\nfor CrowS-Pairs and OGB datasets can be seen in\nFigure 3 and Figure 2, respectively. Our observa-\ntions indicate that the variation of ss across layers\nis more consistent in StereoSet than in the other\ndatasets. Specifically, in CrowS-Pairs, there’s a no-\nticeable undulation in values, but overall, they tend\n288\n(a) Gender (b) Profession (c) Race (d) Religion\nLLaMA-2_7b LLaMA_7b OPT_6.7b\nFigure 1: Layer-wise stereotype score (ss) on StereoSet for pretrained (orange) and debiased (blue) models.\nto rise from the beginning to the end. Debiased\nLLMs, in all instances, exhibit trends comparable\nto their original pretrained counterparts but often\nwith slightly reduced values. A particularly pro-\nnounced difference between the debiased and origi-\nnal pretrained LLMs is evident in the LLaMA_7B’s\nlater layers, as seen in Figure 3(c) when assessing\nCrowS-Pairs’ religious bias.\nFurthermore, the OPT_6.7B model initially\ndemonstrates an anti-stereotypical stance on reli-\ngious bias in its early layers. However, this stance\nrapidly shifts to a more stereotypical one in subse-\nquent layers. In the OGB dataset, visualized in Fig-\nure 2, the discrepancy between pretrained and debi-\nased models is more pronounced for LLaMA_7B\nand LLaMA-2_7B. We’ve further bifurcated our\nanalysis based on male and female-dominated jobs,\nexamining how each model’s preference for gender-\nspecific words changes layer by layer.\nTo delve deeper, we conducted a manual analysis\nof layer-wise bias using a sample from the CrowS-\nPairs dataset. We fed both stereotypical and anti-\nstereotypical sentences to the pretrained LLMs and\ndocumented the predictions at each layer. This\nprocess was then repeated for the debiased LLMs.\nAs an illustration, Figure 4 showcases results from\nthe LLaMA_7b model for the stereotype sentence,\n“My mom spent all day cooking for Thanksgiving.”\nAn intriguing observation in our analysis is the\nprediction of probable bi-gram tokens by both the\ninitial and, in certain instances, later layers. For\ninstance, in Figure 4(a), the terms “light” and “long”\nemerge as predictions for some layers at the “day”\ntoken step. A comprehensive list of examples can\nbe found in our Appendix section.\n4.2 Are de-biasing techniques effective on\nlanguage models?\nEarlier studies (Ranaldi et al., 2023; Meade et al.,\n2022) have shown that the application of debiasing\nmethods can decrease bias scores while causing\nonly slight increases in model perplexity. In Table\n2, we display the ss values for both pre-trained and\ndebiased models using the StereoSet dataset. Our\nresults reveal an average reduction of 3.15 (±1.63)\nin ss values. Interestingly, the OPT model’s drop\nis less significant than that of the LLaMA models.\nFor religion bias, in particular, we note a smaller\ndecline of 2.17 (±0.11) points. This could be due\nto the PANDA dataset distribution; the PANDA\ndataset used to debias the LLMs is mainly centered\non gender, age, and race.\nThe CrowS-Pairs dataset scores are provided in\nTable 3. We identify a more pronounced average\ndecline (7.13 ±6.79) in ss. Yet, it’s noteworthy\nthat in certain instances, the bias score even rises\n289\nOPT_6.7bLLaMA_7bLLaMA-2_7b\n(a) On male dominated\njobs\n(b) On female dominated\njobs\nMale\nPreference\nFemale\nPreference\nMale\nPreference\nFemale\nPreference\nFigure 2: Layer-wise preference percentage on occupa-\ntion gender bias, of original model (orange) and corre-\nsponding debiased version (blue).\nafter debiasing (e.g., OPT’s scores on gender, age,\nand disability, and LLaMA-2_7b’s scores on sexual\norientation).\nThe ss values derived from the OGB dataset are\npresented in Table 4. Post-debiasing, the changes\nin bias scores here are relatively mild. Only the\nLLaMA-2_7b model achieves scores nearing parity\nfor female-dominated professions.\nTo discern the alterations in the models’ gener-\nation behaviors, we use contexts from the Stere-\noSet dataset, truncating the context to only include\nwords preceding [BLANK]. Table 5 offers sample\noutputs for each type of bias. In some instances,\nthe bias is eliminated, as seen in the second exam-\nple. However, in others, the model might display a\ndifferent stereotype post-debiasing, as observed in\nthe first example. Elsewhere, the model either re-\ntains its original bias or exhibits anti-stereotypical\ntendencies, as illustrated in the third and fourth\nexamples, respectively.\n(a) Gender (b) Race (c) Religion\nOPT_6.7bLLaMA_7bLLaMA-2_7b\nFigure 3: Layer-wise stereotype score on CrowS-Pairs\nusing pretrained (orange) models and debiased (blue)\nmodels.\n5 Discussion and Conclusion\nSince the advent of LLMs, numerous studies have\naimed to decode their operations, exploring ques-\ntions like where they store factual information, how\nthey learn from context, and more recently, their\nsafety. However, while many investigations have\ndelved into the outputs of these models, few have\nexamined the evolution of their behavior within the\nneuron layers.\nIn our research, we delve into the individual lay-\ners of LLMs to understand their potential for bias.\nWe assess several current models layer-by-layer us-\ning widely recognized datasets. Through a detailed\nmanual analysis of token predictions in interme-\ndiate layers, we elucidate the effects of debiasing\nmeasures. Our results reveal that different layers\nin LLMs behave uniquely concerning various bi-\nases, with each model presenting its own pattern.\nMoreover, every dataset paints a distinct picture;\nfor example, the OGB dataset exhibits a marked\nbias for male terms in male-dominated professions,\ncontrasting sharply with the near-neutral gender\nbias in the CrowS-Pairs dataset.\nThese findings underscore the importance of\n290\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \nFigure 4: Layer-wise predictions obtained using logit lens on pretrained LLaMA-2_7b.

We suspect that these observations are\nsignificantly influenced by the way prompts are\nstructured. To strengthen our findings, we plan to\ninclude a concept-oriented analysis at each layer,\ncomplementing our token-based approach, in sub-\nsequent work. We also aim to test newer probing\ntechniques like the tuned lens (Belrose et al., 2023)\nin future research. Contrasting our current results\nwith these new techniques might offer insightful\ndifferences.\nThe insights gained from the analysis above\ncould be applied in conjunction with model editing\nmethods, such as (Dong et al., 2022; Meng et al.,\n2022), to specifically address and eliminate biases.\nModel editing techniques are presently used to re-\nvise factual information within language models\n292\nand have demonstrated effectiveness. Our hypothe-\nsis is that these techniques could be modified and\nextended to effectively mitigate biases within the\nmodels.\nWe hope our work spurs further inquiry into the\nbehavior of these models. There’s a vast landscape\nawaiting exploration, and by understanding these\nmodels more deeply, we can devise more effective\nstrategies to address bias.\nLimitations\nWe’d like to address certain limitations of our study\nand potential areas for further research: (a) While\nwe’ve utilized counterfactual data training, a rec-\nognized debiasing method, our study could benefit\nfrom integrating other techniques, like null-space\nprojection. (b) Our analysis of the layer-wise im-\npact of debiasing relies on intermediate token pre-\ndictions. However, a thorough examination of the\ndistribution shifts at each layer could provide more\ndepth. (c) Our current study doesn’t incorporate\ncausal analysis methods like those presented in\n(Vig et al., 2020). We intend to integrate such\nmethods in subsequent research. (d) Our research\nwas constrained by the hardware resources at our\ndisposal, specifically the NVIDIA A100 with 80\nGB of RAM. This limitation prevented us from\ntraining adapters for some of the larger models.\nEthics Statement\nWe’ve used publicly available datasets for our re-\nsearch. However, it is worth noting that these\ndatasets have limitations, especially concerning nar-\nrow definitions related to gender, race, and religion.\nWe recognize these constraints and aim to broaden\nour dataset choices to more fully address these bi-\nases in future research. Additionally, stereotype\nscores are mainly for comparison purposes. It’s\ncrucial to understand that a score of 50 doesn’t\nnecessarily indicate a bias-free model. Instead, it\nprovides a benchmark to help assess and under-\nstand biases in the model’s behavior.\nReferences\nNora Belrose, Zach Furman, Logan Smith, Danny Ha-\nlawi, Igor Ostrovsky, Lev McKinney, Stella Bider-\nman, and Jacob Steinhardt. 2023.
