    "abstract": "This paper proposes a three-phase five legged wound transformer core constructed of two high permeability Si-Fe wound cores and two conventional Si-Fe wound cores. The two large internal wound cores are manufactured of high permeability, grain-oriented electrical steel. The two small outer wound cores are manufactured of conventional, grain-oriented electrical steel. The specific arrangement is based on experimental evidence concerning the peak flux density non-uniformity of the typical three-phase five legged wound transformer core, constructed of the high magnetization grain-oriented steel. Since the peak flux density of the two outer cores is lower than the two internal cores, low cost, low permeability, conventional grain-oriented electrical steel can be used for the outer cores. Losses, excitation currents, flux waveforms, and their harmonics contents are presented in this paper. A comparison of the mixed three-phase transformer core and the typical one is also carried out. © 2006 IEEE.",
