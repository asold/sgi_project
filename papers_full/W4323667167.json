The disease is caused by mutations in the ANTXR2 (anthrax toxin receptor\ncell adhesion molecule 2) gene and affects multiple systems, including the skin, bones, and internal organs.\nJHF is a progressive disorder and there is currently no cure. It is an extremely rare disorder, with only a few\nhundred cases reported worldwide.\nThe disease affects males and females equally and has a global distribution. Clinical manifestations of JHF\ncan range from mild to severe and often require extensive medical and surgical management \n[1]\n.\nAnesthetic care for patients with JHF can be challenging due to the involvement of multiple systems and the\nprogressive nature of the disease. In this case report, we present the anesthetic management of a patient\nwith JHF undergoing surgery, highlighting the importance of a thorough preoperative evaluation and a\nmultidisciplinary approach to ensure safe and effective anesthesia care \n[2-4]\n. \nOur patient underwent a minor procedure and had a benign anesthetic course, we elected to report this case\nfor two reasons. First, there are few published case reports of which we are aware of adults with the\nsyndrome undergoing surgical procedures. More importantly, this report was written with the assistance of\nChatGPT, a large language model type of generative artificial intelligence. Our report highlights the\npotential as well as the limitations of this technology.\nCase Presentation\nThe patient is a 39-year-old female who presented for resection of a benign lesion on the second toe of the\nright foot (Figure \n1\n). The patient consented to this report and participated actively in its preparation and\nreview.\n1\n2\n \n Open Access Case\nReport\n \nDOI:\n 10.7759/cureus.35946\nHow to cite this article\nSegal S, Khanna A K (March 09, 2023) Anesthetic Management of a Patient With Juvenile Hyaline Fibromatosis: A Case Report Written With the\nAssistance of the Large Language Model ChatGPT. Cureus 15(3): e35946. \nDOI 10.7759/cureus.35946\nFIGURE\n 1: The patient’s lesion preoperatively\nShe had a long history of JHF, followed for several years by a dermatologist, and for approximately 25 years\nprior to surgery by plastic surgeons. She first presented in her early teens with a persistent lesion on her\nright knee which recurred multiple times after resection and/or steroid injection. After multiple rounds of\ntreatment, she developed persistent and bothersome lesions on her great toes, which also recurred after\nresections. She noted that the fibromas had so enlarged her toes that she was unable to wear ordinary\nshoes. She was referred to plastic surgery and underwent more extensive resection efforts including skin\ngrafting, but experienced recurrence and eventually underwent bilateral great toe amputation. She was also\nfollowed for persistent lesions on her left arm and upper back (Figure \n2\n).\n2023 Segal et al. Cureus 15(3): e35946. DOI 10.7759/cureus.35946\n2\n of \n7\nFIGURE\n 2: Previous resections of the great toes and lesions on the left\narm and back\nOver time, she decided to forego additional resection attempts on her knee and the lesion gradually receded.\nShe has made the same decision regarding her arm and back, with substantial regression of the arm lesion,\nbut the persistent lesion on her right toe led her to seek limited resection for the present operation.\nHer past medical history was otherwise unremarkable, notably only for a benign splenic cyst, a bicornuate\nuterus, allergic rhinitis, and a history of keloid formation after an unrelated surgery. She did not smoke or\nuse alcohol. She had no drug allergies and did not regularly use prescription medications. The review of\nsystems was otherwise negative. She had no history of problems with previous anesthetics. She has no\nchildren and knows of no affected relatives. She had not undergone genetic testing.\nOn examination, the lungs were clear, and the heart showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs. BP\nwas 110/58 mmHg, HR 80/minute, SpO\n2\n 98% on room air. Examination of the airway revealed 3-\nfingerbreadth mouth opening, 4-fingerbreadth thyromental distance, Mallampati class I oropharyngeal\nfeatures, full range of motion of the neck, normal gingiva and teeth, and otherwise normal\nfacies. Laboratory studies (electrolytes, liver function tests, TSH, CBC) obtained less than three months prior\nto the operation were unremarkable, and additional preoperative studies were not performed given the\nnature of the procedure.\nA 20 G peripheral IV was placed. Standard ASA monitors were applied. The patient received 2 mg of\nmidazolam for preoperative anxiolysis. General anesthesia was selected due to the brief outpatient nature of\nthe procedure and patient preference. Anesthesia was induced with 250 mg propofol and a supraglottic\nairway (laryngeal mask airway) was positioned on the first attempt without difficulty. Anesthesia was\nmaintained with isoflurane, 1.3%-1.6% end-tidal concentration; the patient breathed spontaneously during\nmost of the case but was supplemented with SIMV and pressure support prior to surgical incision. She\nreceived glycopyrrolate for its antisialagogue effect, postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis with\nondansetron, and pre-incision cefazolin. Her anesthetic course was uneventful and she emerged\nuneventfully and the LMA was removed. She was taken to the outpatient post-anesthesia care unit where\nshe rapidly recovered and was discharged home.\nDiscussion\nThe patient presented in this case report with JHF underwent an uneventful anesthetic management for a\ntoe lesion resection. The clinical course of her disease had been relatively benign, with only diffuse skin\ninvolvement noted, and thus her care did not pose any major difficulties. However, the presentation of JHF is\nquite variable and can have important anesthetic implications \n[2-10]\n. More importantly, we prepared this\nreport of an extremely rare problem anesthesiologists may encounter with the assistance of ChatGPT, which\nis a large language model capable of generating fluently composed text on a multitude of topics, even one as\nobscure as JHF.\n2023 Segal et al. Cureus 15(3): e35946. DOI 10.7759/cureus.35946\n3\n of \n7\nThe condition was first characterized by Murray in 1873, and at that time was known as molloscum fibrosum\n[11]\n. It is exceedingly rare, with only a few hundred cases reported worldwide, mostly describing the known\nhyaline fibromatosis syndrome (HFS) management of individual patients. It is properly understood to be\npart of a spectrum of related conditions known as HFS, comprising JHF and a more severe form presenting in\ninfancy, infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH) \n[12]\n. Both conditions are related to mutations in chromosome\n4q21 in the anthrax toxin receptor-2 gene (ANTXR2, also known as capillary morphogenesis gene 2 [CMG2])\n[13]\n. It appears that the types of mutations in the more severe ISH are more extensive and involve an\nextracellular domain, while those in JHF tend to be in-frame (missense) mutations of the cytosolic domain\n[14]\n. The normal physiologic function of ANTXR2 is not fully characterized, but the protein binds collagen IV\nand laminin, suggesting that it may be involved in extracellular matrix adhesion. Defects in this molecule\nlead to abnormal deposition of hyaline material in perivascular areas, presenting as cutaneous lesions, joint\ncontractures, and in some cases internal organ dysfunction. In ISH disruptions to bone and internal organs\nare seen and often lead to death in childhood, whereas the course of JHF is often much more benign and\ntends to involve primarily skin and joints \n[12,13]\n. The mutation is inherited in an autosomal recessive\nfashion and has been reported somewhat more frequently from areas of the world in which consanguineous\nparentage is more common (Middle East, North Africa) than in the West \n[15,16]\n.\nThe obscurity of the condition is illustrated by no entry for it in UpToDate, a comprehensive, peer-reviewed,\ncontinuously updated online medical reference \n[17]\n. It is also not mentioned in the text Anesthesia and\nUncommon Diseases or any major English language anesthesia textbook. Unsurprisingly, there are only a\nhandful of reports of anesthetic management of JHF or ISH, and most commonly in young children \n[2-10]\n.\nTwo reports of anesthetic management of adults with HFS have also been published \n[4,5]\n.\nThe anesthetic implications of HFS are primarily related to patient positioning and airway management. The\npresence of flexion contractures and large cutaneous lesions may complicate patient positioning for\nintravenous line placement, anesthesia induction, regional anesthesia procedures, or the surgery itself\n[3,4,10,13,16,18]\n. Our patient did not manifest any such limitations, illustrating the variable presentation of\nthe disease. Particularly in pediatric patients with severe ISH, airway management can be very complicated.\nGingival hyperplasia, hyaline infiltration of the tongue, and cutaneous lesions around the lips may be so\nextreme that insertion of conventional or video laryngoscopes may be impossible. Even if insertion of a\nlaryngoscope is feasible, temporomandibular joint contracture and neck immobility may complicate\nvisualization of the larynx. Many case reports have described use of a flexible bronchoscope to secure the\nairway \n[3,4,6,7]\n. In our patient, the airway appeared normal, and she reported no prior problems with\nanesthesia. Given the short expected surgical duration, we elected to use a supraglottic airway, which was\npositioned easily. We believe this to be the only report of the use of a supraglottic airway (in this case an\nLMA) in HFS. We suggest that such an approach may be reasonable to consider for cases involving\nstraightforward cutaneous resections even if the airway appears compromised, as a flexible bronchoscope\ncould be placed through the LMA should endotracheal intubation become necessary. In general, drug\nresponses once anesthetized have reportedly been normal, though one case of apparent succinylcholine\nresistance in a 47-year-old patient was reported, but of uncertain relationship to JHF \n[5]\n. Similarly, our\npatient reacted predictably to intravenous and inhalation anesthetics, requiring normal to slightly greater\nthan expected dosages.\nThis case report was written with the assistance of ChatGPT in response to a challenge issued by the journal\n[19]\n. ChatGPT is a large language model that has been trained using deep learning techniques by OpenAI. It\nis a type of artificial intelligence system that has the ability to generate fluent language on a multitude of\ntopics, including those related to the biomedical field. One of the unique features of ChatGPT is its ability to\n\"predict the next word\" in a given sentence or text, which allows it to generate coherent and natural-\nsounding language. This is achieved by training the model on large amounts of text data, which allows it to\nlearn the patterns and structures of language. As a result, ChatGPT is able to generate language that is both\ngrammatically correct and semantically meaningful, making it a valuable tool for natural language\nprocessing in the biomedical field.\nThe preceding paragraph following the first sentence was written by ChatGPT, as was the introduction to this\nreport and the conclusion which follows (Figures \n3\n-\n5\n). It is important to note that the software could never\nactually write the case presentation (on which it could not have been trained), nor could it likely\nmeaningfully compare and contrast this case to others in the literature. Indeed, when the software was\ninitially asked to \"write a case report on the anesthetic management of JHF\" it composed an entirely\nfictitious case about the management of a 13-year-old boy presenting airway difficulty during\nanesthesia. While it may have done so by modeling its prose after previously published case reports, it was\nobviously unsuited to drafting the full report of an actual case. Therefore, we asked it to draft only certain\nsections, such as the introduction and parts of the discussion.\n2023 Segal et al. Cureus 15(3): e35946. DOI 10.7759/cureus.35946\n4\n of \n7\nFIGURE\n 3: ChatGPT-drafted introduction of this report\nFIGURE\n 4: ChatGPT draft of the conclusion section of this report\n2023 Segal et al. Cureus 15(3): e35946. DOI 10.7759/cureus.35946\n5\n of \n7\nFIGURE\n 5: ChatGPT’s original erroneous description of the genetics of\nthe disease\nMoreover, the exercise of composing this report also illustrates several of the other challenges of using large\nlanguage models in creative or scholarly writing. Though trained on a huge data set and refined by human\ninput (“reinforcement learning”) and ultimately through a separate “reward” AI model tuning the output of\nthe main language model (Proximal Policy Optimization), ChatGPT nonetheless has no semantic\nunderstanding of the text it writes \n[20]\n. This can lead it to generate fluent but erroneous prose. For example,\nwhen first queried for assistance with this report, the system eloquently but incorrectly attributed JHF to a\nmutation in the alpha-fodrin gene, which is located on chromosome 17q21.3 (Figure \n5\n). In addition, it\nsignificantly overestimated the incidence of the condition in the introduction (1:100,000 live births-this\nfigure was redacted from the final version), as this would imply 40 cases per year in the U.S. and 1400 cases\nper year worldwide, far more than is apparent from the literature. Moreover, when prompted to “please cite\nseveral references from the literature to accompany a case report on the anesthetic implications of Juvenile\nHyaline Fibromatosis” the system returned 5 citations, all from legitimate anesthesiology journals, complete\nwith digital object identifiers, none of which were familiar to the authors. Further investigations\ndemonstrated that all five were entirely fictitious. Finally, the repeated queries and fact checking required to\nensure the veracity of the finished product added significantly to the task of preparing this paper. Thus, we\nsuggest that any use of ChatGPT at this stage of its evolution be done in the role of generating a rough draft\nor “head start” on a paper, but expert review and refinement is essential.\nConclusions\nWe conclude by offering two versions of the summary of our work. \nFirst, per ChatGPT: In conclusion, the anesthetic management of patients with JHF requires a thorough\npreoperative evaluation and a multidisciplinary approach to ensure safe and effective anesthesia care. In\nthis case, the patient's limited involvement of the skin and skeleton allowed for uneventful anesthetic\nmanagement. The anesthetic implications of JHF should be considered in the preoperative evaluation and\nmanagement of these patients, and a tailored approach should be taken to minimize the risk of adverse\nevents during surgery.\nSecond, per the authors: ChatGPT is a powerful text composition tool that offers the possibility of\nsimplifying or speeding up some writing tasks, including those in the biomedical literature. However, its\nlimitations are significant, including the possibility of drafting entirely incorrect prose, so careful human\ndiligence in using the tool remains essential.\nAdditional Information\nDisclosures\nHuman subjects:\n Consent was obtained or waived by all participants in this study. \nConflicts of interest:\n In\ncompliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following: \nPayment/services\ninfo:\n All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the\nsubmitted work. \nFinancial relationships:\n All authors have declared that they have no financial\nrelationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an\ninterest in the submitted work. \nOther relationships:\n All authors have declared that there are no other\n2023 Segal et al.
