    "abstract": "This project introduces an innovative virtual reality (VR) training program for student Nurse Practitioners, incorporating advanced 3D modeling, animation, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Designed to simulate realistic patient interactions, the program aims to improve communication, history taking, and clinical decision-making skills in a controlled, authentic setting. This abstract outlines the methods, results, and potential impact of this cutting-edge educational tool on nursing education.",
