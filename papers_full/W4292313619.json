  "abstract": "In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved competitive performance in the field of ground-based cloud image (GCI) classification. Proposed CNN-based methods can fully extract the local features of images. However, due to the locality of the convolution operation, they cannot well establish the long-range dependencies between the images, and thus they cannot extract the global features of images. Transformer has been applied to computer vision with great success due to its powerful global modeling capability. Inspired by it, we propose a Transformer-based GCI classification method that combines the advantages of the CNN and Transformer models. Firstly, the CNN model acts as a low-level feature extraction tool to generate local feature sequences of images. Then, the Transformer model is used to learn the global features of the images by efficiently extracting the long-range dependencies between the sequences. Finally, a linear classifier is used for GCI classification. In addition, we introduce a center loss function to address the problem of the simple cross-entropy loss not adequately supervising feature learning. Our method is evaluated on three commonly used datasets: ASGC, CCSN, and GCD. The experimental results show that the method achieves 94.24%, 92.73%, and 93.57% accuracy, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. It proves that Transformer has great potential to be applied to GCI classification tasks.",
