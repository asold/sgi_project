My comments are as follows:\nOne of the advantages of using LLM for logical reasoning is the ability to reason in natural language, just like humans.\nDoes this study address reasoning with natural language? Or does it target programmatic reasoning?\nLLMs only predict and output the words that follow the input string, which may be accompanied by hallucinations.\nCurrent LLMs seem to have difficulty directly performing complex logical reasoning. I believe, as the author argues,\nthat the limited length of tokens that can be input into the LLM is one of the reasons that limit the LLM's ability to\nperform logical reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs that allow reading and writing to external memory\n[1]\n have been\nstudied. They may be able to store the reasoning process in external memory. I would like you to discuss the logical\nreasoning abilities of these LLMs.\nOther than the length of the tokens that can be input into the LLMs, are there any other possible factors that would limit\nthe LLM's ability to perform logical reasoning?\nReferences\n1\n. \n^\nPacker, Charles, et al..
