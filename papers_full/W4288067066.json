    "abstract": "Mineral oil has long been used as an adequate coolant and dielectric medium in power transformer design. However, it is flammable and environmentally risky as it may be leaked or spilled. Therefore, ester fluids, which have been increasingly used in the last two decades, look promising as an ideal dielectric option. This research aims to better understand how using ester fluid insulation in power transformers impacts their physical and electrical dimensions, including their load-losses, impedance, masses, and equipment dimensions. Three case studies were carried out in a Portuguese electrical equipment manufacturer’s facility, with varying electrical parameters and physical properties of the mineral oil and ester-filled power transformers. The main results enhanced the known good electrical behavior of ester fluids, namely creating a lower electric field around winding wedges, yet the use of ester fluids led to higher load-losses, larger masses, additional radiators and, consequently, higher manufacturing costs. Nevertheless, the contribution of ester-filled power transformers to the improved environmental safety (reducing spillage and fire risks), among other advantages, makes ester fluids a truly eco-friendly option for power transformer design.",
