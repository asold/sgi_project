It plays a vital role in autonomous driving,\nmedical image processing, mobile applications, and many\nother fields. In order to achieve better segmentation perfor-\nmance, recent semantic segmentation methods pursue abun-\ndant long-range context. Different methods have been pro-\nposed to capture and encode rich contextual information,\nincluding large receptive fields (Chen et al. 2014, 2017,\n2018), multi-scale feature fusion (Ronneberger, Fischer, and\nBrox 2015; Zhao et al. 2017), self-attention mechanism (Fu\net al. 2019; Huang et al. 2019; Yuan et al. 2018; Zhao et al.\n2018b; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), etc. Among them, the self-\nattention mechanism, as an essential component of trans-\nformers, has been proven to have a remarkable ability to\nmodel long-range context. Although these works improve\nsignificantly, they usually lead to high computational costs.\n*Work strenthened during an internship at Meituan.\n†Corresponding author\nCopyright © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

Our methods are presented in red stars, while\nothers are presented in blue dots. Our SCTNet establishes a\nnew state-of-the-art speed-accuracy trade-off.\nNote that self-attention-based works even have square com-\nputation complexity with respect to image resolution, which\nsignificantly increases latency in processing high-resolution\nimages. These limitations hinder their application in real-\ntime semantic segmentation.\nMany recent real-time works adopt a bilateral architecture\nto extract high-quality semantic information at a fast speed.\nBiSeNet (Yu et al. 2018) proposes a bilateral network to sep-\narate the detailed spatial features and ample contextual infor-\nmation at early stages and process them in parallel, which is\nshown in Figure 2(a). Following BiseNet (Yu et al. 2018),\nBiSeNetV2 (Yu et al. 2021) and STDC (Fan et al. 2021)\nmake further efforts to strengthen the capability to extract\nrich long-range context or reduce the computational costs of\nthe spatial branch. To balance inference speed and accuracy,\nDDRNet (Pan et al. 2022), RTFormer (Wang et al. 2022),\nand SeaFormer (Wan et al. 2023) adopt a feature-sharing ar-\nchitecture that divides spatial and contextual features at the\ndeep stages, as shown in Figure 2(b). However, these meth-\nods introduce dense fusion modules between two branches\nto boost the semantic information of extracted features. In\nconclusion, all these bilateral methods suffer from limited\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6378\nInput1/41/81/161/32FMOutput\n1/81/8FMFM\n(a) (b) (c)\nInput1/41/81/161/32\n1/2\nFM\n1/41/8\nOutput\nInput\nOutput\n1/161/32SIAMSIAM\n1/41/8 1/41/81/161/32\nFigure 2: Real-time semantic segmentation paradigms.

Dashed arrows and boxes denote\ntraining-only.\ninference speed and high computational costs due to the ad-\nditional branch and multiple fusion modules.\nTo eliminate the aforementioned dilemma, we propose\na single-branch CNN with transformer semantic informa-\ntion for real-time segmentation (SCTNet). It can extract se-\nmantic information efficiently without heavy computation\ncaused by the bilateral network. Specifically, SCTNet learns\nlong-range context from a training-only transformer seman-\ntic branch to the CNN branch. To mitigate the semantic gap\nbetween the transformer and CNN, we elaborately design\na transformer-like CNN block called CFBlock and utilize a\nshared decoder head before the alignment. With the aligned\nsemantic information in training, the single-branch CNN\ncan encode the semantic information and spatial details\njointly. Therefore, SCTNet could align the semantic repre-\nsentation from the large effective receptive field of trans-\nformer architecture while maintaining the high efficiency\nof a lightweight single branch CNN architecture in infer-\nence. The overall architecture is illustrated in Figure 2(c).\nExtensive experimental results on three challenging datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed SCTNet has a better trade-off\nbetween accuracy and speed than previous works. Figure 1\nintuitively shows the comparison between SCTNet and other\nreal-time segmentation methods on the Cityscapes val set.\nThe main contributions of the proposed SCTNet can be\nsummarized as the following three aspects:\n• We propose a novel single-branch real-time segmentation\nnetwork called SCTNet. By learning to extract rich se-\nmantic information utilizing semantic information align-\nment from the transformer to CNN, SCTNet enjoys high\naccuracy of the transformerwhile maintaining fast in-\nference speed of the lightweight single branch CNN.\n• To alleviate the semantic gap between CNN features\nand transformer features, we design theCFBlock (Conv-\nFormer Block), which could capture long-range context\nas a transformer block using only convolution opera-\ntions. Moreover, we propose SIAM(Semantic Informa-\ntion Alignment Module) to align the features in a more\neffective way.\n• Extensive experimental results show that the proposed\nSCTNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art meth-\nods for real-time semantic segmentation on Cityscapes,\nADE20K, and COCO-Stuff-10K. SCTNet provides a\nnew view of boosting the speed and improving the per-\nformance for real-time semantic segmentation.\nRelated Work\nSemantic Segmentation.FCN (Long, Shelhamer, and Dar-\nrell 2015) leads to the tendency to utilize CNN for se-\nmantic segmentation. Following FCN, a series of improved\nCNN-based semantic segmentation methods are proposed.\nDeepLab (Chen et al. 2017) enlarges the receptive field with\ndilated convolution. PSPNet (Zhao et al. 2017), U-Net (Ron-\nneberger, Fischer, and Brox 2015), and RefineNet (Lin et al.\n2017) fuse different level feature representations to capture\nmulti-scale context. Some methods (Fu et al. 2019; Huang\net al. 2019; Yuan et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2018b)propose\nvarious attention modules to improve segmentation perfor-\nmance. In recent years, transformer has been adopted for\nsemantic segmentation and shows promising performance.\nSETR (Zheng et al. 2021) directly applies the vision trans-\nformer to image segmentation for the first time. PVT (Wang\net al. 2021) introduces the typical hierarchical architecture\nin CNN into the transformer-based semantic segmentation\nmodel. SegFormer (Xie et al. 2021) proposes an efficient\nmulti-scale transformer-based segmentation model.\nReal-time Semantic Segmentation.Early real-time seman-\ntic segmentation methods (Paszke et al. 2016; Wu, Shen,\nand Hengel 2017) usually accelerate inference by compress-\ning channels or fast down-sampling. ICNet (Zhao et al.\n2018a) first introduces a multi-resolution image cascade net-\nwork to accelerate the speed. BiSeNetV1 (Yu et al. 2018)\nand BiSeNetV2 (Yu et al. 2021) adopt two-branch architec-\nture and feature fusion modules to achieve a better trade-\noff between speed and accuracy. STDC (Fan et al. 2021)\nrethinks the two-branch network of BiSeNet, removes the\nspatial branch, and adds a detailed guidance module. DDR-\nNets (Pan et al. 2022) achieves a better trade-off by shar-\ning branches in the early stages. Very recently, some effi-\ncient transformer methods for real-time segmentation have\nbeen proposed, but they still have unresolved problems. Top-\nFormer (Zhang et al. 2022) only uses transformer on 1/64\nscale of the feature maps, leading to low accuracy. RT-\nFormer (Wang et al. 2022) and SeaFormer (Wan et al. 2023)\nneed frequent interaction between the two branches. This ad-\nditional computation slows down the inference speed. In ad-\ndition, there are also some single-branch and multi-branch\nmethods in real-time segmentation.\nAttention mechanism.

Among them, Some classical linear attention like\nSwin (Liu et al. 2021) and MSG (Fang et al. 2022) con-\ntains frequent shift or reshape operations which bring lots of\nlatency. MSCA (Guo et al. 2022b) shows a promising per-\nformance, but the large kernel is not employ-friendly, and\nthe multi-scale design of attention further incurs inference\nspeed. External attention (Guo et al. 2022a) has a very sim-\nple form. It uses external parameters as the key and value and\nimplements the attention mechanism with two linear layers.\nGFA(GPU-Friendly Attention) (Wang et al. 2022) improves\nexternal attention by replacing head split in EA with group\ndouble norm, which is more friendly for GPU devices.\nMethodology\nMotivation\nRemoving the semantic branch of bilateral networks can\nsignificantly speed up the inference. However, this results\nin shallow single-branch networks that lack long-range se-\nmantic information, leading to low accuracy. While using\ndeep encoders and powerful decoders or complex enhance-\nment modules can recover accuracy, it slows down the infer-\nence process. To address this issue, we propose a training-\nonly alignment method that enriches semantic information\nwithout sacrificing inference speed. Specifically, we pro-\nposed SCTNet, a single-branch convolution network with a\ntraining-only semantic extraction transformer, which owns\nhigh accuracy of transformer and fast inference speed of\nCNN. The overview of SCTNet is presented in Figure 3.\nConv-Former Block\nAs different types of networks, the feature representations\nextracted by CNN and transformer significantly differ. Di-\nrectly aligning the features between the CNN and the trans-\nformer makes the learning process difficult, resulting in lim-\nited performance improvement. In order to make the CNN\nbranch easily learns how to extract high-quality semantic in-\nformation from the transformer branch, we design the Conv-\nFormer Block. Conv-Former Block simulates the structure\nof the transformer block as much as possible to learn the se-\nmantic information of the transformer branch better. Mean-\nwhile, the Conv-Former Block implements the attention\nfunction using only efficient convolution operations.\nThe structure of the Conv-Former Block is similar to the\nstructure of a typical transformer encoder (Vaswani et al.\n2017), as presented in the left of Figure 4. The process can\nbe described as follows:\nf = Norm(x + ConvAttention(x)),\ny = Norm(f + FFN (f)), (1)\nwhere Norm(·) refers to batch normalization (Ioffe and\nSzegedy 2015), and x, f, y denote input, hidden feature and\noutput, respectively.\nConvolutional Attention. Attention mechanisms used for\nreal-time segmentation should have the property of low la-\ntency and powerful semantic extraction ability. As discussed\nin the related work, We believe GFA is a potential candidate.\nOur convolutional attention is derived from GFA.\nThere are two main differences between GFA and the pro-\nposed convolutional attention. Firstly, we replace the matrix\nmultiplication in GFA with pixel-wise convolution opera-\ntions. Point convolution is equivalent to pixel-to-pixel multi-\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6380\nConvolution \nAttention\nAdd & Norm\nFFN\nAdd & Norm\nInput\nOutput\nGDN\nH\nW\nC\n…\nC\nk\nN\n…\nC\nk\nN\nH\nW\nC\n…\nC\nN\nk\nC\nkN\n…\nGDN\n𝑲𝒆𝒚𝟏\n𝑲𝒆𝒚𝟐 𝑽𝒂𝒍𝒖𝒆𝟐\n𝑽𝒂𝒍𝒖𝒆𝟏\n𝑸𝒖𝒆𝒓𝒚\nFigure 4: Design of Conv-Former Block (left) and the de-\ntails of convolutional attention (right).

These operations are detrimental to maintaining the in-\nherent spatial structure and bring in extra inference latency.\nMoreover, convolution provides a more flexible way to ex-\ntend external parameters. Then, due to the semantic gap be-\ntween the transformer and CNN, it is not enough to capture\nrich context that simply calculates the similarity between\nseveral learnable vectors and each pixel and then enhances\nthe pixels according to the similarity map and the learn-\nable vectors. To better align the semantic information of the\ntransformer, we enlarge the learnable vectors to learnable\nkernels. On the one hand, this converts the similarity calcu-\nlation between pixel and learnable vectors to that between\npixel patches with learnable kernels. On the other hand, the\nconvolution operation with learnable kernels retains more\nlocal spatial information to some extent. The operations of\nconvolution attention can be summarized as follows:\nX = θ (X ⊗ K) ⊗ KT , (2)\nwhere X ∈ RC×H×W ,K ∈ RC×N×k×k, KT ∈\nRN×C×k×k represents input image and learnable query and\nkey, respectively. C, H, W denote the channel, height, and\nwidth of the feature map, respectively. N denotes the num-\nber of learnable parameters, and k denotes the kernel size of\nthe learnable parameters. θ symbolizes the grouped double\nnormalization, which applies softmax on the dimension of\nH × W and grouped L2 Norm on the dimension of N. ⊗\nmeans convolution operations.\nTaking efficiency into consideration, we implement the\nconvolution attention with stripe convolution rather than\nstandard convolutions. More specifically, we utilize a 1 × k\nand a k × 1 convolution to approximate a k × k convolu-\ntion layer. Figure 4 illustrate the implementation details of\nconvolution attention.\nFeed Forward Network.Typical FFN plays a vital role in\nproviding position encoding and embedding channels. The\ntypical FFN (Feed Forward Network) in recent transformer\nmodels consists of a expand point convolution, a depth-wise\n3×3 convolution, and a squeeze point convolution. Different\nfrom typical FFN, our FFN is made up of two standard 3 ×\n3 convolution layers. Compared with the typical FFN, our\nFFN is more efficient and provides a larger receptive field.\nSemantic Information Alignment Module\nA simple yet effective alignment module is proposed to con-\nduct the feature learning in the training process, as shown in\nFigure 3. It can be divided into backbone feature alignment\nand shared decoder head alignment.\nBackbone Feature Alignment.Thanks to the transformer-\nlike architecture of the Conv-Former Block, the alignment\nloss can easily align the Conv-Former Block’s features with\nthe features of transformers. In short, the backbone feature\nalignment first down-sample or up-sample the feature from\nthe transformer and CNN branches for alignment. Then it\nprojects the feature of the CNN to the dimension of the trans-\nformer. The projection can: 1) unify the number of channels\nand 2) avoid direct alignment of features, which damages\nthe supervision of ground truth for the CNN in the training\nprocess. Finally, a semantic alignment loss is applied to the\nprojected features to align the semantic representations.\nShared Decoder Head Alignment.Transformer decoders\noften use the features of multiple stages for complex de-\ncoding, while SCTNet decoder only picks the features of\nstage2&stage4. Considering the significant difference in de-\ncoding space between them, direct alignment of the decod-\ning features and output logits can only get limited improve-\nment. Therefore, we propose shared decoder head align-\nment. Specifically, the concatenation stage2&stage4 features\nof the single-branch CNN are input into a point convolution\nto expand the dimension. Then the high-dimension features\nare passed through the transformer decoder. The transformer\ndecoder’s new output features and logits are used to calcu-\nlate alignment loss with its origin outputs.\nOverall Architecture\nTo reduce computational costs while obtain rich semantic\ninformation, we simplify the popular two-branches archi-\ntecture to one swift CNN branch for inference and a trans-\nformer branch for semantic alignment only for training.\nBackbone. To improve the inference speed, SCTNet adopts\na typical hierarchical CNN backbone. SCTNet starts from\na stem block consisting of two sequential 3×3 convolution\nlayers. The former two stages consist of stacked residual\nblocks (He et al. 2016), and the latter two stages include\nthe proposed transformer-like blocks called Conv-Former\nBlocks (CFBlocks). The CFBlock employs several elabo-\nrately designed convolution operations to perform the simi-\nlar long-range context capturing function of the transformer\nblock. We apply a convdown layer consisting of a strid-\nden convolution with batch normal and ReLu activation for\ndown-sampling at the beginning of stage 2 ∼ 4, which is\nomitted in Figure 3 for clarity.\nDecoder Head. The decoder head consists of a\nDAPPM (Pan et al. 2022) and a segmentation head.\nTo further enrich the context information, we add a DAPPM\nafter the output of stage 4. Then we concatenate the output\nwith the feature map of Stage 2. Finally, this output feature\nis passed into a segmentation head. Precisely, the segmen-\ntation head consists of a 3×3 Conv-BN-ReLU operator\nfollowed by a 1×1 convolution classifier.\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6381\nMethod Reference #Params↓ Resolution FPS(TRT)↑ FPS(Torch)↑ mIoU(%)↑\nSFNet-ResNet18 ECCV 2020 12.3M 2048 × 1024 50.5 24.0 79.0\nAFFormer-B-Seg100 AAAI 2023 3.0M 2048 × 1024 58.3 28.4 78.7\nAFFormer-B-Seg75 AAAI 2023 3.0M 1536 × 768 96.4 38.6 76.5\nAFFormer-B-Seg50 AAAI 2023 3.0M 1024 × 512 148.4 49.5 73.5\nSegNext-T-Seg100 NeurIPS 2022 4.3M 2048 × 1024 46.5 28.1 79.8\nSegNext-T-Seg75 NeurIPS 2022 4.3M 1536 × 768 78.3 45.6 78.0\nPIDNet-S CVPR 2023 7.6M 2048 × 1024 127.1 93.2 78.8\nPIDNet-M CVPR 2023 34.4M 2048 × 1024 90.7 39.8 80.1\nCNN-based Bilateral Networks\nBiSeNet-ResNet18 ECCV 2018 49.0M 1536 × 768 182.9 112.3 74.8\nBiSeNetV2-L IJCV 2021 - 1024 × 512 102.3 67.6 75.8\nSTDC1-Seg75 CVPR 2021 14.2M 1536 × 768 209.5 101.9 74.5\nSTDC2-Seg75 CVPR 2021 22.2M 1536 × 768 149.2 84.3 77.0\nSTDC1-Seg50 CVPR 2021 14.2M 1024 × 512 397.6 146.2 72.2\nSTDC2-Seg50 CVPR 2021 22.2M 1024 × 512 279.7 94.6 74.2\nDDRNet-23-S TIP 2022 5.7M 2048 × 1024 138.9 106.7 77.8\nDDRNet-23 TIP 2022 20.1M 2048 × 1024 101.9 56.7 79.5\nTransformer-based Bilateral Networks\nTopFormer-B-Seg100 CVPR 2022 5.1M 2048 × 1024 128.4 81.4 76.3\nTopFormer-B-Seg50 CVPR 2022 5.1M 1024 × 512 410.9 95.7 70.7\nSeaFormer-B-Seg100 ICLR 2023 8.6M 2048 × 1024 103.6 37.5 77.7\nSeaFormer-B-Seg50 ICLR 2023 8.6M 1024 × 512 231.6 45.2 72.2\nRTFormer-S NeurIPS 2022 4.8M 2048 × 1024 - 89.6 76.3\nRTFormer-B NeurIPS 2022 16.8M 2048 × 1024 - 50.2 79.3\nSCTNet-S-Seg50 Ours 4.6M 1024 × 512 451.2 160.3 72.8\nSCTNet-S-Seg75 Ours 4.6M 1536 × 768 233.3 149.2 76.1\nSCTNet-B-Seg50 Ours 17.4M 1024 × 512 374.6 144.9 76.5\nSCTNet-B-Seg75 Ours 17.4M 1536 × 768 186.6 105.2 79.8\nSCTNet-B-Seg100 Ours 17.4M 2048 × 1024 105.0 62.8 80.5\nTable 1: Comparisons with other state-of-the-art real-time methods on Cityscapes val set. Seg100, Seg75, Seg50 denote the\ninput size of 1024 × 2048, 768 × 1536, 512 × 1024, respectively. #Params refers to the number of parameters.\nTraining Phase. It is well known that transformer excels\nat capturing global semantic context. On the other hand,\nCNN has been widely proven to be better at modeling hierar-\nchical locality information than transformers. Motivated by\nthe advantages of transformer and CNN, we explore equip-\nping a real-time segmentation network with both merits. We\npropose a single-branch CNN that learns to align its fea-\ntures with those of a powerful transformer, which is illus-\ntrated in the blue dotted box in Figure 3. This feature align-\nment enables the single-branch CNN to extract both rich\nglobal context and detailed spatial information. Specifically,\nthere are two streams in the training phase. SCTNet adopts\na train-only transformer as the semantic branch to extract\npowerful global semantic context. The semantic information\nalignment module supervises the convolution branch to align\nhigh-quality global context from the transformer.\nInference Phase. To avoid the sizeable computation costs\nof two branches, only the CNN branch is deployed in the in-\nference. With the transformer-aligned semantic information,\nthe single-branch CNN can generate accurate segmentation\nresults without the extra semantic extraction or costly dense\nfusion. Specifically, the input image is fed into a single-\nbranch hierarchy convolution backbone. Then the decoder\nhead picks up the features in the backbone and conducts sim-\nple concatenation followed by pixel-wise classification.\nAlignment Loss\nFor better alignment of semantic information, a alignment\nloss focusing on semantic information rather than spatial in-\nformation is needed. In the implementation, we use CWD\nLoss (channel-wise distillation loss) (Shu et al. 2021) as the\nalignment loss, which shows better results than other loss\nfunctions. CWD Loss can be summarized as follows:\nϕ(xc) = exp(xc,i\nT )\nPW·H\ni=1 exp(xc,i\nT )\n, (3)\nLcwd = T 2\nC\nCX\nc=1\nH·WX\ni=1\nϕ(xc,i\nT ) · log\nhϕ(xc,i\nT )\nϕ(xc,i\nS )\ni\n, (4)\nwhere c = 1 , 2, ..., Cindexes the channel, and i =\n1, 2, ..., H· W denotes the spatial location, xT and xS are\nthe feature maps of the transformer branch and CNN branch,\nrespectively.ϕ converts the feature activation into a channel-\nwise probability distribution, removing the influences of\nscales between the transformer and the compact CNN. To\nminimize Lcwd, ϕ(xc,i\nS ) should be large when ϕ(xc,i\nT ) is\nlarge. But when ϕ(xc,i\nT ) is small, the value of ϕ(xc,i\nS ) does\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6382\nnot matter. This force the CNN to learn the distribution of the\nforeground salience, which contains the semantic informa-\ntion. T denotes a hyper-parameter called temperature. And\nthe larger T is, the softer the probability distribution is.\nExperiments\nDatasets and Implementation Details\nWe conduct experiments of the SCTNet on three datasets,\ni.e., Cityscapes (Cordts et al. 2016), ADE20K (Zhou et al.\n2017), and COCO-Stuff-10K (Caesar, Uijlings, and Ferrari\n2018) to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For a\nfair comparison, we build our base model SCTNet-B with\na comparable size to RTFormer-B/DDRNet-23/STDC2.\nFurthermore, we also introduce a smaller variant called\nSCTNet-S. We first pre-train our CNN backbones on Ima-\ngeNet (Deng et al. 2009), then fine-tune it on semantic seg-\nmentation datasets. The semantic transformer branch in the\ntraining phrase can be any hierarchical transformer network.\nIn our implementation, we choose SegFormer as the trans-\nformer branch for all experiments. We measure the inference\nspeed of all methods on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090. All\nreported FPS results are obtained under the same input reso-\nlution for fair performance comparison unless specified. For\nCityscapes, we measure the speed implemented with both\ntorch and tensor-RT.\nComparison with State-of-the-art Methods\nResults on Cityscapes. The corresponding results on\nCityscapes(Cordts et al. 2016) are shown in Table 1. Our\nSCTNet outperforms other real-time methods by a large\nmargin and attains the best speed-accuracy trade-off with\nboth tensorRT and Torch implementations. For example,\nour SCTNet-B-Seg100 achieves 80.5% mIoU at 62.8 FPS,\nwhich is a new state-of-the-art performance for real-time\nsegmentation. Our SCTNet-B-Seg75 reaches 79.8% mIoU,\nwhich is better than the state-of-the-art transformer-based\nbilateral network RTFormer-B and cnn-based bilateral net-\nwork DDRNet-23 in accuracy but has a two times faster\nspeed. Our SCTNet-B is faster at all input resolutions with\nbetter mIoU results than all other methods. Besides, our\nSCTNet-S also achieves a better trade-off compared with\nSTDC2 (Fan et al. 2021), RTFormer-S (Wang et al. 2022),\nSeaFormer-B (Wan et al. 2023) and TopFormer-B (Zhang\net al. 2022).\nResults on ADE20K. On ADE20K(Zhou et al. 2017),\nour SCTNet achieves the best accuracy with the fastest\nspeed. For instance, our SCTNet-B achieves 43.0% mIoU\nat superior 145.1 FPS, which is about 1.6 times faster\nthan RTFormer-B (Wang et al. 2022) with 0.9% higher\nmIoU performance. Our SCTNet-S reaches 37.7% mIoU\nwhile keeping the highest FPS among all other methods on\nADE20K (Zhou et al. 2017). Considering the large variety of\nimages and various semantic categories in ADE20K (Zhou\net al. 2017), this outstanding results further also demonstrate\nthe generalization capability of our SCTNet.\nResults on COCO-Stuff-10K.

Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-\nart GFABlock (Wang et al. 2022) and MSCANBlock from\nSegNext (Guo et al. 2022b), our CFBlock get better speed\nand accuracy trade-off. Our CFBlock has 0.9% higher mIoU\nthan GFABlock and maintains the similar performance with\nfewer parameters and faster speed than MSCANBlock. This\nalso demonstrates that our SCTNet can better mitigate the\ngap of semantic information between CNN and transformer\nwhile getting rid of the high computation cost.\nEffectiveness of the Semantic Information Alignment\nModule. Although our SIAM(semantic information align-\nment module) is closely related to the elaborately designed\nSCTNet, it can also improve the performance of other CNN\nand transformer segmentation methods. As presented in Ta-\nble 5, employing our SIAM attains consistent improvements\non SegFormer, SegNext, SeaFormer, and DDRNet, which\nproves the effectiveness and generalization capability of our\nproposed SIAM. At the same time, as representatives of the\nbilateral-branch transformer and the bilateral-branch CNN\nnetwork, the improvements of SeaFormer and DDRNet are\nrelatively slim. This may be attributed to the fact that their\nbilateral-branch network structure already benefits from the\nadditional semantic branch. And this also confirms that the\ncooperation of our SIMA and training-only transformer does\nplay the role of the semantic branch in the bilateral-branch\nnetwork, leading to improvements in the accuracy of the\nsingle-branch network.\nComponents Ablation. We explore the effect of the pro-\nposed components in Table 6. Take Seg100 as an example,\nsimply replacing the Resblock with our CFBlock brings a\n2.1% improvement of mIoU with little speed loss. The BFA\nleads to a 1.2% higher mIoU, and the SDHA further attains\na 0.8% improvement of mIoU without sacrificing speed.\nVisualization Results\nFigure 5 shows visualization results on Cityscapes (Cordts\net al. 2016) validation set.

Extensive ex-\nperiments demonstrate that SCTNet achieves new state-of-\nthe-art results. Moreover, by demonstrating the efficiency of\nSCTNet, we provide a novel insight for the semantic branch\nin the bilateral-branch network and a new way to boost the\nreal-time segmentation community by not only adopting the\nstructure of the transformer but also unitizing its knowledge.\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n6384\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by Hubei Provincial Natural Science\nFoundation of China No.2022CFA055 and the National Nat-\nural Science Foundation of China No.62176097.\nReferences\nBo, D.; Pichao, W.; and Wang, F. 2023.
