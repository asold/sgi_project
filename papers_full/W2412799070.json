  "abstract": "Building information modeling (BIM) refers to the continuous use of semantically rich three-dimensional (3D) building models throughout the entire lifecycle of a facility. BIM data models capture the geometry as well as the semantics of buildings and its constituent parts in an object-oriented manner. They have been developed to achieve high-quality data exchange between software applications, reduce data loss, and increase interoperability. Across the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, the open-data model industry foundation classes (IFC) has become a well-accepted standard. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a procedural language called the IFC procedural language (IFCPL) that can be easily embedded into an IFC-based building information model. This enables software developers to exchange procedural programs between different software applications in a platform-independent way using a neutral data format. IFCPL programs describe algorithms that operate on a set of input parameters and generate a set of output parameters (return values). The EXPRESS language, which is part of standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP), provides the concept of functions and rules for representing algorithmic knowledge. However, EXPRESS operates on the schema level, i.e., the rules and algorithms defined apply to all instances of the respective entity type in the same manner. IFCPL shifts this concept from the schema (class level) to the instance level and is not limited to realizing data integrity or attribute derivation. The paper describes in detail the features and the design of the IFCPL language. To illustrate its applicability, the language is used to demonstrate how transition curves of road or railway alignments can be described in a very flexible manner: IFCPL allows the definition and exchange of algorithms for computing the curve coordinates from general curve parameters. In doing so, software developers can dynamically define and exchange new transition curve types without modifying the IFC data model. At the same time, this approach helps avoid misinterpretations of informal curve descriptions. The procedural language provides a powerful option for adding enhancements and reduces software development costs by allowing semiautomated integration. Besides the alignment use case, there are many other application areas in which IFCPL can be used and where software developers as well as software users can benefit from it. They are discussed extensively throughout the paper.",
