    "abstract": "In isolated power converters, the transformer is a key part of voltage transformation and isolation. Since common-mode (CM) noise is rather difficult to suppress compared with different-mode (DM) noise, more and more scholars are paying attention to the characteristics of CM noise, especially in high-frequency CM noise behaviors. CM noise can be further divided into conducted CM noise and radiated CM noise, and the main focus of this paper is on conducted CM noise. The CM coupling capacitance of the transformer is one of the main contributors of CM noise, which has been verified in many previous studies. Hence, eliminating the CM noise in a transformer coupling path can significantly lower the whole CM noise level of the converter. Professional conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) testing instruments are quite expensive. In this paper, a general transformer evaluation technique for CM noise behavior is proposed. Only a signal generator and oscilloscope can achieve transformer CM noise behavior evaluation. PCB planar flyback transformers are designed, and a series of noise spectrums and voltage waveforms can verify the effectiveness of the proposed transformer evaluation method. The flyback adapter porotype can pass the EMI standard limited line EN55022 class B by the proposed evaluation method.",
