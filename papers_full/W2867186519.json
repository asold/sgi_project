Statistic survey \nconducted by the IEEE indicates that during a 16-year period, \n10% of oil-immers ed p ower transformer s in a fleet are ex pected \nto exhibit a catastrophic failure [2]. This  motivated worldwide \nutilities to adopt m ore reliable condition-based maintenance \ntechniques rather than time-based maintenance schemes [3]. A \nCIG RE survey indicates failure rate of transform ers owing to \nis s ues originating from the insulation system is  11% [4]. Thus , in \norder to form ulate a reliable condition -based maintenance \nstrategy, comprehensive understanding of insulation system  \nageing m echanism  and quantifying  the ex tent of its integrity \nare inevitable. Ageing of the transform er insulation system  is \nattributed to several factors, including tem perature, m oisture \ncontent, and ox ygen concentration along with electrical and \nmechanical stresses within the transf ormer [5]. Although \ninsulation system  ageing is an unavoidable process, ex posure \nof transformer to excessive levels of above m entioned ageing \ncontributors results in accelerated aging. Lim itation of \neconomic resources emphasizes the neces s ity for utilities  to \nadopt reliable and cost effective m odels for transformer life \nes timation and asset management decision. Som e m odels were \nput forward by IEEE [6] and IEC [7] organizations to estimate \nrem aining life of transform ers based on the oper ating \ntemperature of the transformer ins ulation s ystem. Although the \nadvancem ent of online condition m onitoring technologies have \nfacilitated utilities to collate temperature data of their assets in \na more practicable way; still, there is no confident perception \nof temperature distribution within transformers. Furthermore, a \nlifetime es timation model based on the insulation tem perature \ndoes not reflect the im pact of other ageing factors such as \nox ygen and m oisture, which leads to less credibility and \nreliability of that m odel. A power transform er asset \nmanagement d ecision m odel was proposed in [2 ], which is  \nbased on fuzzy logic infere nce system . In spite of being a \ncom prehensive m odel for the purpose of asset m anagem ent \ndecision, some criticisms can be directed toward the \nManuscript received on X Month 2016, in final form XX Month 2016. \n \napplicability of such m odel on a regular basis as this m odel \nincludes some parameters that are not m easured during \ntransformer routine testing. Furtherm ore, in order to m easure \nsom e of the param eters deployed in this m odel, such as sweep \nfrequency response analysis, transformer needs to be taken out \nof service. Moreover, all developed m odels in the literature for \npower transformer remnant life estimation and asset \nmanagement decision are based on either static artificial neural \nnetwork m odels or fuzzy logic rules without giving m uch \nattention to enhancing these rules based  on the future \nmeasurements and feedback  of the m odels outcom es. This  \npaper is ai m ed at introducing an age estim ation m odel for \npower transform ers, developed by utilizing adaptive neuro \nfuzzy logic inference system (ANFIS) that can facilitate the \nim provem ent of m odel accuracy th rough the continuous \nevaluations  of the measured parameters and the m odel’s \noutcome. The parameters used in this  m odel are routinely \nmeasured diagnostic indicators, including interfacial tension \nnum ber, 2-Furfuraldehyde (2-FAL) content in oil and m oisture \ncontent within cellulose insulation, which are strongly \ncorrelated with the transform er aging.  Furtherm ore, an \nintegrated asset ma nagem ent decision m odel is developed \nbased on diagnostic parameters that are frequently measured \nduring routine inspection s. \n2  TRANSFORMER AGEIN G MECHANISM \nIt is widely accepted that the health condition of a \ntransform er is highly dependent on the overall health of its \ninsulation system . Degradation of the oil -immers ed  \ntransform er insulation system  com prised of paper and \nelectrical ins ulating oil occurs  through com plex  and \nsophisticated m ulti-factorial process due to interdependent \nrelation between ageing fact ors and their additive effect [8 ]. \nThe accumulative effect of temperature, moisture, acids and \nox ygen within a transform er is identified as the m ajor cause of \ntransform er aging m echanism . As insulation system  ages, \nseveral by-products are generated. Acids are one of these by-\nproducts , resulted from  both oil ox idat ion and cellulose \ndegradation [9]. Despite the fact that oil ox idation produces \nseveral types of acids, only som e specific acid types  having \nlow solubility in oil are aggressive and accelerate the aging \nrate of paper insulation [10]. C ellulos e insulation acid \nhydrolysis also yields another aging by-product recognized as \nfuranic com pounds [11]. Furans are one of the diagnostic tool s \nused in evaluating the health level of transformer paper \nins ulation. In spite of the availability of other cellulose \ndegradation indicators, such as dissolved gas analysis (through \ncarbon-ox ide concentrations and th eir ratio) [12], furan \ncontent in the oil is  widely accepted as an indicator to reflect \nthe degree of polym erization (DP) of cellulosic chain [11, 13].  \nT able 1. Degree of polymerization and 2-FAL concentration correlation \nDP Value 2-FAL (ppm) Significance \n1200-700 0-0.1 healthy insulation \n700-450 0.1-1.0 moderate deterioration \n450-250 1-10 extensive deterioration \n<250 >10 end of  lif e \nEx tensive research was conducted to establish the correlation \nbetween 2-Furfuraldehyde (2-FA L) furanic com pound, which \nhas higher production rate than other furan com pounds and  DP \n[5]. The relationship between DP and 2-FAL concentration in \nthe oil along with their significance in the interpretation of \npaper insulation ageing level is highlighted in table 1  [14]. \nAs another decisive contributor to the insulation system  \ndegradation, m oisture content plays an integral role in the \nreliability of transform er operation. Moisture content within a \ntransformer can be sourced by several means, such as \npenetrat ion of m oisture due to atm ospheric leaks, paper or \npressboard degradation, and insufficient drying out of \ncellulose insulation thr oughout m anufacturing process [8 ]. \nBecause of hygroscopic nature of paper, cellulose insulation \ntends to absorb alm ost all e xis ting m oisture within a \ntransformer. Moisture accelerates the ageing rate of paper \ninsulation, triggers partial discharge between windings and \nmay  even cause flashover within the  transformer [5, 15]. \nConsidering detrim ental effect of m oisture on the insula tion \nsystem  of a transform er, not only fastidious drying-out process \nduring m anufacturing procedure should be conducted, but also \nex cessive moisture content of in-service suspected units \nshould be rem oved by m eans of on-line drying-out m ethods, \nsuch as the application of heat and vacuum, cellulose cartridge \nfilters or molecular sieves [15 ]. A transition of m oisture \nbetween the paper insulation and insulating oil occurs when \nthe transformer operating tem perature  alters  until an \nequilibrium  status is reached [16]. Although absolute mois ture \ncontent within transformer oil s ample is  measured, in parts per \nmillion (ppm), during routine inspection, relative saturation of \nthe oil is used for determ ining the criticality level of the \nm oisture. Relative saturation of the oil depends on  oil \ntem perature and indicates the capacity of the oil to hold \nmoisture before it becomes saturated and free water drops are \nvisible within the oil solution [17 ]. Utilizing m oisture \nequilibrium  curves [5], an estimation of the water content \nwithin the paper insulation can also be calculated using \nrelative saturation of the oil.  \nThe third diagnostic indicator of transformer insulation \nsystem  decom position, included in the proposed m odel in this \npaper is the interfacial tension num ber of the  ins ulating oil. \nInterfacial tension num ber with the unit of m N/m  provides an \nindication of the level of polar contam inants and ageing by-\nproducts within the oil solution [18]. As ex plained above, the \naccum ulation of acids in the insulation system  has a \nretroactively adverse impact on the ageing rate of \ntransformers. With a strong correlation observed between the \nIFT num ber and acid ity level of transformer oil [19 ], \ninterfacial tension num ber can fully represent the contribution \nof acids to the ageing of transform er insulation system  in the \nproposed m odel. Table 2 [8, 18] includes diagnostic \ncategorization of the paper insulation m oisture content and \ninterfacial tension num ber of the insulating oil. \nT able 2.

D ue to this \ncom plex ity, developing a precise mathematical m odel for \ninsulation system  degradation behavior is extremely difficult. \nIn this paper, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System  \n(ANFIS) is implemented to estimat e transformer life and \nprovide a proper asset management decision based on s o me \ndiagnostic parameters, w hich yields higher precision in the \nm odel output. \nThe typical structure of the fuzzy inference system is  \nelaborated in [14, 18, 20, 21, 26]. Fuzzy inference system is  \ndeployed to m odel system s whose rule structure is defined as \nper the perception of the user from  attributes of the presented \ndata. The parameters of membership functions are selected \nhaphazardly with m erely looking at the data. With using \nANFIS m ethod, one can tailor the m em bership functions to \nthe values of input and output data in order to account for all \ntheir characteristics and variations. Mem bership functions in a \nfuzzy logic system  are defined by the param eters determ ining \nthe shape of each m em bership function and the interval they \ncover. On the other hand, ANFIS m ethod enables adaptive \nadjustm ent of the m em bership functions through adjusting \ntheir parameters with any change in the input data. Therefore, \nin the case of condition m onitoring and asset m anagem ent \ndecision, m em bership functions and  fuzzy rules can be \nm odified based on the variations in the input and feedback \nfrom  output data.  \nThe fundam entals of neuro-adaptive learning technique are \nidentical to those of artificial neural networks, ANN. \nAcquiring satisfactory results after being ut ilized in s elf-\nlearning as well as solving com plex  problem s, ANN has been \ndeployed in pattern recognition and trend prediction [22], [23]. \nFor the proposed m odel in this paper, input data including 2 -\nFAL content in the oil, m oisture content within the pape r \ninsulation, interfacial tension num ber of the oil and the actual \nage of the inves tigated transformers calculated based on their  \ncommissioning date are collated from different transformers of \ndifferent ratings, operational conditions, lifespans and desi gns. \nThis  data is  divided into two groups for training and testing, \ninvolving 60 and 40 sets , respectively. ANFIS m ethod  is  \nem ployed to adjust m em bership functions param eters through \nthe Levenberg -Marquardt back p ropagation -optimizing \nalgorithm . Using historical data of input and output variables, \nthis algorithm  optim izes the param eters of m em bership \nfunctions by em ploying random  weights which are com puted \nand adapted through the learning process so as to m inim ize the \nerror between the actual and estimated re s ult [24]. \nFigure 1 depicts the training error in years, which is the \ndifference between the actual (based on designated rem nant \noperational life) and estimated age (based on above m entioned \ndiagnostic parameters) of the transform ers over the course of \ntraining. As can be seen in Figure 1, training error decreases to \na value of 1 year at the epoch of 2000. The architecture of the \ndeveloped ANFIS model is  shown in Figure 2 in which input \nvariables to the system are oil i nterfacial tension num ber, 2-\nFAL content in the oil and m oisture content within the paper \ninsulation while the output variable is the transformer \nestimated age. \n \nFigure 1.  Training error against the number of  epochs \n \nFigure 2.  The architecture of  the proposed ANFIS model \n \nFigure 3.  Adapted membership f unctions of  2-FAL content in oil \n \nFigure 4.

Adapted membership f unctions of  interf acial tension number \n\n \nAs shown in the model structure of Figure 2, input variabl es \nare m apped through input m em bership functions and \nsubsequently through output m em bership functions and their \nassociated param eters into output variable. Once the training \nconcludes, the outcom e will be the required ANFIS-based \nm odel and its optim ized m em bership functions. Adjusted bell-\nshape m em bership functions of the proposed ANFIS -based \nmodel are sh own in Figures 3, 4 and 5. In contrary to  fuzzy \nlogic m odels, these m em bership functions are optim ized ever y \ntime ANFIS training is  performed which facilitates continuous \nim provem ent in the model’s accuracy. The entire range of \nevery parameter used in the ANFIS-based model is selected \nbased on the input data , while the interval covered by each \nm em bership function is determ ined by the optim ized \nparameters calculated by the ANFIS training method. Figure 6 \nshows graphical illus tration of the automated rules associated  \nwith the developed ANFIS m odel. \nValidation of the developed  m odel is accom plished using \nthe designated testing data. As documented in Figure 7, actual \nages of the transformers that are allocated to this set of data \nare displayed in blue circles along with the age estimated by \nthe developed ANFIS -based m odel in red stars . The figure \nreveals a satisfactory level of precision of the proposed m odel. \n \nFigure 6.  Developed rules by the ANFIS method f or the proposed \ntransf ormer lif e estimation model \nTo assess the robustness of the proposed m odel, another set \nof data collected from  various in-service transformers is used \nto compare the transformer age estimated by the proposed \nANFIS m odel with that of a m odel established based on fuzzy \ninference system. Actual age which is calculated based on \ncom m issioning date of the transform ers, estim ated age of the \ntransform ers obtained through the proposed ANFIS -based \nm odel, and that estim ated by fuzzy logic inference system  \n(FIS) m odel along with the estim ation error of each m odel \n(calculated as per (1)), are lis ted in Table 3. \n( )( )% 100()\nAge Actual Age EstimatedError Age Actual\n−= ×                      (1) \nBy com paring the results  of the ANFIS and FIS models, \none can conclude that the ANFIS -based m odel is able to \nestimate transformers life with much higher accuracy.  \nFor ex ample, a 39-year transform er having 2-FAL content of \n5.3 (m g/kg Oil), paper m oisture content of 4.6 (%M/DW) and \nIFT num ber of 15 (m N/m ), is estim ated to have 38 years of \nage by the ANIFS m odel  with an error of 2.6%, while the \nerror is 6.2% when FIS is used to estim ate the age of this \ntransform er. This high accuracy is referred to the optim ization \nof m em bership functions parameters when ANFIS i s \nem ployed. These parameters are arbitrarily determ ined by the \nuser when FIS is em ployed. \n \nFigure 7.  Validation of  the developed ANFIS transformer-aging model  \nT able 3.

This m odel consists of \nseveral ANFIS m odels trained in the same procedure as \nelaborated above. In the proposed m odel, overall criticality of \na transform er is determ ined as a result of insulating oil, paper \ninsulation and electrical criticalities. Oil ins ulation criticality \noutput indicates the ex tent of risk that the insulating oil poses \nto the transformer and is determined  based on  interfacial \ntension num ber, aci dity level and m oisture content with \nconsidering the effect of temperature  on the m oisture \nequilibrium  process. \nPaper insulation and thermal criticality are determined \nbased on the level of 2-FAL content in the oil, heating gases \n(ethylene C\n2H4 and ethane C2H6), and the quantity  of carbon-\nox ide concentrations in the oil m easured by dissolve d gas \nanalys is , DGA, along with carbon -ox ides ratio, CO2/CO. \nCarbon-ox ides ratio can be used as a n indicator of the \nex cessiveness of paper insulation degradation as \nrecom m ended by the IEC [29] and IEEE [30] standards. This  \nratio is used when  carbon-ox ide concentrations ex ceed the \nrecommended limits [29, 30]. When this ratio is  les s than three \nor more than eleven, it indicat es s ignificant cellulos e \ndegradation .  \nElectrical criticality is determined by considering partial \ndischarge and arcing criticalit ies. Partial discharge activity \nwithin a transform er can be detected by m onitoring the \nconcentration of  hydrogen  (H2) and m ethane (CH4) gases \nwhile acetylene  (C2H2) concentration is an indicator for \nsustained arcing [ 31]. Based on the m odel overall criticality \nand transformer life estimation, asset management decision  \n(D) ranging  between 0% (new tran sformer) to 100% \n(immin ent risk condition) is  recommended as shown in Table \n4.  \nTable 5 provides a comparison between the developed asset \nm anagem ent m odel and practical management decision s \n(assessed by ex pert asset management  utility team). \nFor instance, for the s ixt h case study in the imminent failure \ncategory in Table 5, the proposed m odel has revealed an asset \nmanagement decision criticality of 99.1%, with an error of \n0.1% compared to the asset management number decided by \nan ex pert asset management utility team based on the provided \ndiagnosing param eters. Having an oil criticality of 91%, paper \ncriticality of 98%, electrical criticality of 19%, and the overall \ncriticality of 99%, this transformer is categorized within the \nimmin ent failure zone. To elaborate more on this , very high \noil criticality of this transformer originates form the ex cessive \nam ount of acidity as well as m oisture in the oil, which yields \nhigh level of m oisture within the paper insulation . The IFT \nnum ber of this transformer has entered in the im m inent failure \nzone as per the diagnostic categories provided in Table 2. In \naddition, c arbon-ox ide concentrations are outside IEEE \nrecom m ended lim its, which together with carbon-oxides  ratio \nof 12.3  reveal ex cessive degradation of the cellulose \nins ulation. This m ay be attributed to the im proper cooling of \nthis transform er due to the form ation of sludge within the oil \nsolution as th e IFT num ber drops below 22. Ov er time, the \nformed sludge  within the oil solution  deposi ts on the \ntransform er’s internal com ponents , res ulting in reduced \ncooling efficiency of the transformer. Moreover, ex cessive \ndegradation of this transform er is due to the ex tensive level of \nm oisture within the paper insulation, which together with the \nacids accelerate degradation rate of the paper insulation , \nproducing  out-of-limits  carbon -ox ide concentrations . \nElectrical criticality of this transformer however is estimated \nto be at a satisfactory level as there is no evidence of partial \ndischarge activity or sustained arcing within the transformer \nand Hydrogen, Methane  and Acetylene concentrations are \nwithin the IEEE recom m ended lim its. The overall criticality of \nthis transformer along with the estimated life, 91%, provides  \nasset m anagem ent decision num ber of 99.6%. According to \ntable 4, this transformer needs to be immediately taken out of \nservice for an internal thorough investigation. Final decision \non whether this transform er should be retired or scrapped is \nm ade based on the engineering judgm ent from  the inspection \noutcom e as well as degree of polym erization (DP) testing of \nthe paper sam ples taken from  the winding insulation. \nT able 4.

This is the m ain difficulty for developing \nanalytical equation s explaining this mechanism. The \ndeveloped m odels in this paper utilize diagnostic indicators \nthat are  regularly measured during transformer routine \nmaintenance inspection. The adaptive neuro fuzzy logic-based \nintegrated m odel put forward in this paper for estim ating the \nage, overall criticality, and consequently asset management \ndecision of a power transform er can be a great contribution to \nm anaging power transform ers life cycle. It is  ex pected that \nwith the usage of this m odel, condition of transform ers can be \ntracked m ore frequently with less financial cost during their \noperational lifetime. The proposed m odel utilizes the least \npossible num ber of es sential key diagnostic parameters that are \nregularly m easured during transform er routine inspection . \nANFIS model provides more accurate res ults when com pared \nto previously s uggested fuzzy inference m odels . It als o  \nfacilitates adaptive m odifications of the rules based on the \nmodel’s outcome and practical measurements. The proposed \nmodel can be implemented with feedback system  that allows \ncollecting, processing, and adapting m odel parameters in real \ntime to continuously  enhance the m odel accuracy  and \nreliability. \nACKNOWLEDGM ENT \nThe authors o f this  article would like to thank Dr Zahra \nJabiri, Mr Kerry Williams  and Mr Emmanuel Santos at \nWestern Power Corporation, WA for their guidance and help \nwith providing the inform ation required to conduct this \nresearch. \nREFERENCES \n[1] Wang, M., et al.
