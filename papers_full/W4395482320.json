    "abstract": "Abstract Phishing and spam have been a cybersecurity threat with the majority of breaches resulting from these types of social engineering attacks. Therefore, detection has been a long‐standing challenge for both academic and industry researcher. New and innovative approaches are required to keep up with the growing sophistication of threat actors. One such illumination which has vast potential are large language models (LLM). LLM emerged and already demonstrated their potential to transform society and provide new and innovative approaches to solve well‐established challenges. Phishing and spam have caused financial hardships and lost time and resources to email users all over the world and frequently serve as an entry point for ransomware threat actors. While detection approaches exist, especially heuristic‐based approaches, LLMs offer the potential to venture into a new unexplored area for understanding and solving this challenge. LLMs have rapidly altered the landscape from business, consumers, and throughout academia and demonstrate transformational potential to profoundly impact the society. Based on this, applying these new and innovative approaches to email detection is a rational next step in academic research. In this work, we present IPSDM, an improved phishing spam detection model based on fine‐tuning the BERT family of models to specifically detect phishing and spam emails. We demonstrate our fine‐tuned version, IPSDM, is able to better classify emails in both unbalanced and balanced datasets. Moreover, IPSDM consistently outperforms the baseline models in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1‐score, while concurrently mitigating overfitting concerns.",
