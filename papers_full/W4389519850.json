Experimental\nresults and numerous examples verify the effec-\ntiveness of our method.\n1 Introduction\nConditional automatic storytelling, generating a\nstory that satisfies specific target conditions, has\ngained significant attention in the natural language\nprocessing community (Kumar, 2023). Generating\nstories with complex plots is particularly crucial as\nit creates engaging stories of human-level quality\nfor various applications, such as AI novelists and\nAI playwrights (Alhussain and Azmi, 2021).\n∗Corresponding Authors.\nStory generation is an active research area where\nexisting studies approach it from two directions: en-\nhancing controllability and incorporating common-\nsense knowledge (Alabdulkarim et al., 2021). To\nsatisfy target constraints, researchers enhance the\ncontrollability of generation models (Zhou et al.,\n2023a). Rashkin et al. (2020) follow an outline of\nthe plots to generate stories. Wang et al. (2022b)\npropose a BART-based (Lewis et al., 2020) model\nto generate stories according to the fine-grained\npersonalized guidance. Additionally, to produce\nfluent and coherent storylines, researchers investi-\ngate incorporating commonsense knowledge into\ngeneration (Wang et al., 2020a; Guan et al., 2020;\nZhang et al., 2023). Peng et al. (2022) introduce\ncommonsense inference into GPT-2-based (Rad-\nford et al., 2019) model to improve narritive coher-\nence. Qin and Zhao (2022) combine knowledge\nretrieval, knowledge selection, and story generation\ntogether to make the generated story more reason-\nable. The above studies focus on improving con-\ntrollability and logical coherence but rarely explore\nthe generation of stories with complex plots.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) learn com-\nmonsense knowledge from massive texts and de-\nvelop strong abilities to follow human instruc-\ntions (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Taori\net al., 2023). Thus, LLM-based prompt learning\ngenerates fluent and coherent stories with high\ncontrollability (Lu et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2023;\nYao et al., 2023). Lu et al. (2023) prompt GPT-\n3 (Brown et al., 2020) with combinations of multi-\nple target conditions. Xie et al. (2023) demonstrate\nthat by using prompts, GPT-3 generates higher-\nquality stories than other state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmodels. Typically, LLMs generate stories based\non a given prompt (i.e. text spans or a few sen-\ntences) and the outputs are continuations of the\ngiven texts. However, a recurring issue emerges\nin the LLM-based prompting approaches to gener-\nate complex stories: there is a struggle to balance\n3980\nthe complexity and creativity within the generated\nstories (Alabdulkarim et al., 2021; Wang et al.,\n2023). To prompt LLMs to generate stories with\ncomplex plots, users often need to detail control\nsignals within the prompt. This approach presents\na dilemma: the more control information provided,\nthe more likely it is that the generated story will\nfocus solely on describing the given content, thus\nconstraining the story’s potential creativity.\nWe argue that leveraging the information (e.g.\nstory background and plots) from exemplary hu-\nman stories facilitates generating more diverse\nplots. Delving into story details enriches the narra-\ntive with the necessary information, thereby help-\ning to build complex and credible storylines.\nIn this paper, we propose a retrieval-auGmented\ncomplex stoRy generation framework with a fOrest\nof eVidEnce (GROVE), which leverages existing\nstories and evidence to generate and rewrite stories\nfor more complex plots. We construct a retrieval\nrepository that enables the LLM to learn diverse\nplots and common patterns from human-written\nstories. This assists the LLM in generating sto-\nries with complex plots. Moreover, we design an\n“asking-why” 1 prompting scheme that iteratively\nbuilds an evidence forest addressing the ambigui-\nties found in the story from various perspectives.\nThe evidence forest refers to a collection or set of\nevidence trees that are generated to supplement a\nstory in GROVE. Each evidence tree consists of\nnodes representing pieces of evidence and edges\nconnecting them. The root node of the tree repre-\nsents an ambiguous or unclear part in the generated\nstory, while the non-root nodes represent additional\ninformation that provides clarity and background\ndetails to the nodes above them in the tree. Finally,\nwe select the optimal chains of evidence from the\nevidence forest and integrate them into the gener-\nated story, thereby enhancing its complexity and\ncredibility. Our method is not intended to replace\nany specifically designed prompts or techniques\ncurrently employed in the field. Instead, we pro-\npose a flexible and generalizable framework that\nenables LLMs to generate stories with complex\nplots, complementing existing methods.\nOur contributions are threefold: 1) We develop a\nretrieval-augmented framework for generating sto-\nries with complex plots by prompting an LLM; 2)\nWe introduce an “asking-why” prompting scheme\n1We call the prompting method “asking-why” because it\nrequires the LLM to justify why particular ambiguities make\nsense in the generated story.\nto generate a forest of evidence and rewrite the orig-\ninal story based on the optimal evidence chains;\n3) Our approach achieves SOTA performance on\nquantities of testing cases. Detailed analyses vali-\ndate the effectiveness of our approach.\n2 Related work\n2.1 Story Generation\nResearch on automatic story generation can be clas-\nsified into two categories: enhancing controllability\nand incorporating commonsense knowledge (Alab-\ndulkarim et al., 2021). Researchers explore both\nending-focused approach (Zhao et al., 2018; Guan\net al., 2019a) and storyline-focused approach (Peng\net al., 2018) to improve the controllability of gen-\nerated stories. The ending-focused approach aims\nto generate a story with a specific desired ending.\nTambwekar et al. (2019) apply reinforcement learn-\ning to optimize the pre-trained model to generate\nstory plots that consistently reach a specified end-\ning for the story. Wang et al. (2020a) leverage an\ninterpolation model based on GPT-2 to produce\ncoherent narratives with user-specified target end-\nings. Lu et al. (2023) explore the generation ability\nof GPT-3 based on different prompts. The aim of\nstoryline-focused approaches is to make the gen-\nerated story follow an outline of the plot (Rashkin\net al., 2020; Fan et al., 2018). Wang et al. (2022b)\npropose a BART-based (Lewis et al., 2020) model\nto generate stories with desired characters, actions,\nand emotions. Xie et al. (2022) consider psycho-\nlogical state chains of protagonists and propose a\npsychology-guided controllable story generation\nsystem.\nAnother line of work involves the study of in-\ncorporating commonsense into story generation\neither explicitly (Yang et al., 2019; Guan et al.,\n2020; Mao et al., 2019) or implicitly (Wang et al.,\n2020a; Guan et al., 2020). Researchers explicitly\nleverage additional data by incorporating a com-\nmonsense knowledge graph into the model encod-\ning (Guan et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2020b) or\nusing a plot graph based on commonsense descrip-\ntions (Ammanabrolu et al., 2020). Implicit knowl-\nedge stored in model parameters is also helpful in\nproducing stories. LLMs learn from large amounts\nof texts, thereby gaining a rich understanding of\ncommonsense knowledge to generate stories. Xie\net al. (2023) randomly sample few-shot demon-\nstrations to GPT-3 to guide story generation. Yao\net al. (2023) instruct LLM to make multiple plans\n3981\nand vote for the best plan to generate stories. Our\nwork is also based on LLMs. However, unlike ex-\nisting LLM-based approaches for story generation\nthat prompt LLMs with manually chosen cases,\nGROVE automatically retrieves similar examples\nto instruct the LLM.\n2.2 LLM-based Prompting Learning\nIn the context of LLMs, prompting refers to a\nuser inputting a text string to the model, elicit-\ning a response from the LLM according to the\ninput (Liu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). To fully\nleverage LLMs in downstream tasks, researchers\npropose to carefully design prompts either man-\nually (Brown et al., 2020; Hendy et al., 2023;\nSchick and Schütze, 2021) or automatically (Gao\net al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023b; Guo et al., 2022).\nWang et al. (2022a) explore an iterative prompt-\ning framework, which progressively elicits knowl-\nedge from language models by prompting automat-\nically. Wei et al. (2023) find that the Chain-of-\nThought (CoT) prompting, a kind of prompt that\ninstructs the model to provide a rationale for its\nanswer, shows advantages in complex arithmetic\nand reasoning tasks. Zhang et al. (2022b) classify\nCoT prompting into three paradigms: Zero-Shot-\nCoT (Kojima et al., 2022), Manual-CoT (Wei et al.,\n2022), and Auto-CoT (Zhang et al., 2022b). Zero-\nShot-CoT involves adding a prompt like “Let’s con-\nsider the following step-by-step” to the test ques-\ntion, which helps LLMs consider problems more\nlogically. Manual-CoT (Wei et al., 2023) is a few-\nshot prompting method that provides manual rea-\nsoning demonstrations to the LLMs. Zhang et al.\n(2022b) propose Auto-CoT to construct demonstra-\ntions with questions and reasoning chains automat-\nically. Yao et al. (2023) propose Tree-of-Thoughts\n(ToT) prompting to improve LLM’s performance\nby voting for different reasoning. These studies\napproach a task by deconstructing it into multiple\nsteps and executing them sequentially. In contrast,\nour approach initially completes the entire task, and\nthen iteratively refines and improves it.\n2.3 LLM-based Data Augmentation\nResearchers investigate generating pseudo data to\nalleviate the issue of data scarcity (Feng et al., 2021;\nPlušˇcec and Šnajder, 2023) for tasks including\nknowledge distilling (Sanh et al., 2020; Sun et al.,\n2023), event classification (Sarker et al., 2023) and\nharmful content detection (Hartvigsen et al., 2022).\nYoo et al. (2021) combine text perturbation, pseudo-\nlabeling, and knowledge distillation to generate re-\nalistic text samples with LLMs. Sahu et al. (2022)\ncreate prompts from available examples and feed\nthem to LLMs to generate training data for intent\nclassification. Our work is another attempt to lever-\nage LLMs for data augmentation that uses an LLM\nto extract narrative attributes from existing stories.\n3 Method\n3.1 Overview\nFig. 1 presents an overview of our framework.\nGROVE consists of three parts: (1) Retrieval\nRepository builds a repository R with human-\nwritten stories and the associated desired control\nsignals. (2) Evidence Forest Construction via\nAsking Whyretrieves and generates stories with\ninputs (steps 1 to 3 in Fig. 1) and recursively grows\na forest of evidence in support of the story (steps\n4 and 5). (3) Evidence Chains-supported Story\nRewriting selects optimal evidence chains from\nthe evidence forest, which are the most relevant to\nthe target conditions, and employs them to enrich\nthe story (steps 6 to 8 in Fig. 1).\nTo generate a story, our framework receives a\nset of target conditions C = {c1, . . . , cm}, which\ncomprise multiple text spans to express the desired\nmood, plot, genre, subject, etc. By employing an\nLLM, we aim to generate an interesting story with\ncomplex plots satisfying the control conditions.\n3.2 Retrieval Repository\nWe construct a retrieval repository consisting of\nmultiple key-value retrieval items, where the key\nrepresents the target conditions of a story, and the\nvalue is the story itself. To construct the reposi-\ntory, we use a set of conditions extracted from the\nvalue (i.e. story) as the key.The repository acts as\na source of inspiration and provides the LLM with\na rich set of story examples to draw from. It helps\nthe LLM to learn from various narrative attributes\nand incorporate them into its generated stories, fa-\ncilitating the generation of complex storylines.\n3.2.1 Repository Construction\nTo construct the repository, we collect raw stories\nfrom the Internet, using these as values, and employ\nLLM to extract target conditions from the story as\nkeys. To facilitate this extraction, we query the\nLLM using human-written prompts for each type\nof target condition.\n3982\n7 13\n6 13 4 12\n5 12\nRetrieval\nRepository…\nLLM\n“Sad”(              ,           )\n“Angry”(              ,           ) 2 3\n4 5 6 7\n2 3\n4 5 6 7\n1 1\n5 2 1\n6 3 1\nEvidence Forest\nquery\n7 13\nLLM\n: One missing background information in the story is how Maggie died and ended up being \nlaunched back in time.      : Maggie died in a car accident and her consciousness was sent back \nin time due to an experimental technology malfunction.      : Maggie worked as a software \nengineer at a cutting-edge research facility that was experimenting with time travel technology.\n1\n2\n5\nMood: Sad, Plots: It turns out that …\nGenre: Science Fiction, Subject: Cat\nThe genre of\nthis story is\nScience Fiction.\nWhat is the\ngenre of …\n1\n2\n3\n5\n6\n7\n8\n8\n1\n2 3\n4 5\n1\n2 3\n1\n4\nFinal Story\nInitial Story\nStory1\nStory2\nEvidence Tree 1 Evidence Tree 2\nOperation Step\nRepository Construction\nAsking-Why Prompting\n6 13 4 12\n5 12\n\n{1, 𝐴𝐴1} {2, 𝐴𝐴2}\n̅𝜀𝜀1\n̅𝜀𝜀2\nFigure 1: The architecture of GROVE, with each operation step demonstrating the i-th step of the story generation\nprocess. GROVE begins by using the target conditions to retrieve Story2 and its conditions, using these as prompts\nto guide the LLM in generating an initial story (steps 1 to 3; refer to Sec. 3.2). Following this, GROVE constructs\nan evidence forest composed of two evidence trees, by asking-why prompting (steps 4 and 5; refer to Sec. 3.3).\nUltimately, GROVE selects the optimal evidence chains and directs the LLM to rewrite the initial story, resulting in\nthe final story (steps 6 to 8; refer to Sec. 3.4).\nWe obtain the values for retrieval items by col-\nlecting a large set of raw stories from the Internet,\ndenoted as D= {d1, d2, . . . , dn}. To obtain the\ncorresponding keys for these values, we take two\nsteps: prompt construction and condition extrac-\ntion. Specifically, (1) In the prompt construction\nstep, we construct a prompt template prompt(.)\nfor each type of target condition. This template\nserves as a natural language query asking for the\nspecific condition within a given story. Recall that\nC = {c1, . . . , cm}comprises a series of different\ntypes of target control conditions, including story\nplot, subject, etc, where each control condition ci\nis described by a text span. Note that the “plot”\ncondition specifies the storylines that must appear\nin the story, rather than defining a limited set of al-\nlowable plots. For example, for the target condition\n“subject”, the associated prompt template can be:\n“Here is a story: [STORY]. Answer the following\nquestion based on the above story: give a list of\ndistinctive subjects this story is trying to portray. ”,\nwhere “[STORY]” represents the given story con-\ntent. We detail the prompt templates for all target\nconditions in App. F. (2) In the condition extrac-\ntion step, for each story dj in D, we use LLM to\nextract each condition ˜ci by feeding prompti(dj)\ninto the LLM.\nEach story dj, along with its extracted conditions\n˜Cj = {˜c1, . . . ,˜cm}, constitutes an item ( ˜Cj, dj) in\nthe retrieval repository. Ultimately, the repository\nR consists of pairs of stories and their extracted\nconditions: R = {( ˜Cj, dj)}|D|\nj=1 .\n3.2.2 Repository Retrieval\nThe retrieval process searches for the most simi-\nlar condition sets and returns their corresponding\nstories from the retrieval repository. The search is\nbased on the semantic similarity between the target\ncontrol conditions and the items’ keys in R.\nSpecifically, during inference, given a target con-\ndition set C, we define a recommendation score s\nfor each story. To obtain s, we calculate the cosine\nsimilarity between the semantic vector of each con-\ndition in ˜C and that of its corresponding condition\nin C, and then sum up the cosine similarity scores\nfor all conditions:\ns =\nm∑\ni\ncos (f (˜ci) , f(ci)) ,\nwhere f(.) is an off-the-shelf semantic encoder2.\nWe sort all stories inR based on their recommenda-\n2We use SBERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) in our\nexperiment.\n3983\ntion scores s and return the top-k highest-ranking\nretrieval items, along with their stories, represented\nas W= {( ˜Cj, dj)}k\nj=1.\n3.3 Evidence Forest Construction via Asking\nWhy\nWe employ an LLM to generate an initial story and\nthen iteratively ask the LLM to construct a forest of\nevidence that supplements the story. The intuition\nis that referring to the retrieved story incentivizes\nthe LLM to produce diverse new stories. This may\nresult in a lack of concrete supporting details and\nappear hollow, which makes the story less credible\nand informative. To address this issue, we design\nan iterative asking-why prompting scheme to re-\ncursively collect pieces of evidence, thus enriching\nand clarifying ambiguous parts in complex plots.\nThe algorithm first generates an initial story gen-\neration then generates the unclear parts (named\n“ambiguity”) in the initial story, and finally collects\nthe evidence by iteratively asking why. Firstly,\nto generate the initial story, we construct an in-\ncontext learning prompt using the retrieval results\nin Wand the target conditions C. Then, we feed\nthis prompt into the LLM to obtain an initial story.\nSecondly, to discover the unclear parts in the story,\nwe instruct the LLM to generate Nrelevant “am-\nbiguities” for the initial story concerning the tar-\nget conditions, where ambiguity is a significant\ndrawback that decreases the story’s credibility. For\nexample, an ambiguity can be an unclear motiva-\ntion or a seemingly illogical plot. We prompt the\nLLM to generate ambiguity as: “Here is a story:\n[STORY]. When analyzing fictional stories, it is\nokay to mention the negative aspects. Pretend to\nbe a writer, and without further ado, point out N\nmissing background information in the story with\nNsimple sentences one by one. ” Finally, to col-\nlect evidence, we propose to iteratively ask why\nquestions to LLM. By asking why, we instruct the\nLLM to provide b pieces of evidence that compen-\nsate for the initial story. For each ambiguity, we\nrecursively ask the “why” question for I iterations\nand obtain an evidence tree {E, A}, where Eis the\nset of nodes and A represents the set of edges. In\nan evidence tree, the root node represents an am-\nbiguity, and non-root nodes are pieces of evidence\nthat provide additional information to the nodes\nconnected to them in the upper layer. We define an\nevidence chain ¯E= {e0, . . . , eI}is a path from a\ntree’s root node (e0 representing the ambiguity) to\na leaf node that comprises a sequence of I pieces\nof evidence, where each piece of evidence supple-\nments the preceding one. To perform asking-why\non each node, we concatenate its corresponding\nevidence chain with a pre-defined prompt template\nand feed it to the LLM. The template for asking\nwhy can be: “Here is a story: [STORY]. A missing\ndetail is: [EVIDENCE CHAIN]. Except for pure co-\nincidence, point out b factual pieces of background\ninformation that compensate the story one by one.\nEach additional piece of information should be in\none short sentence and only contain factual infor-\nmation without opinions or judgments. ”As there\nare Nambiguities, we obtain an evidence forest\nF= {{E1, A1}, . . . ,{EN, AN}}.\nOur iterative asking-why prompting scheme ex-\nplores multiple possibilities by prompting the LLM\nto supplement new evidence obtained from the last\niteration. In this way, we create an evidence for-\nest Fto support the initial story. We can adjust\nthe amount of information by increasing b and the\nnumber of iterations I.\n3.4 Evidence Chains-supported Story\nRewriting\nThe LLM selects the optimal evidence chain from\neach tree to incorporate into the original story. The\nintuition for story rewriting is to address its ambi-\nguities by incorporating relevant pieces of evidence\ninto the story to provide the necessary information.\nWe select evidence chains to augment the story\nin two steps.\n• Evidence chains selection. For each evidence\ntree, we first concatenate all the evidence\nchains before feeding them into the LLM.\nThen, we prompt the LLM to select the most\nsuitable evidence chain to add to the initial\nstory. The selection is based on the relevance\nbetween chains and the initial story. We repeat\nthis process on all trees in the evidence forest\nFand obtain Nevidence chains, denoted as\n{¯E, A}N\nI=1.\n• Story rewriting. We instruct the LLM to incor-\nporate the information from {¯E, A}N\ni=1 into\nthe initial story to rewrite the final version of\nthe story. The prompt template is: “Here is\na story: [STORY]. Here is the missing back-\nground information: [EVIDENCE CHAINS].\nPretend to be a writer and complete the story\nby including the given information. Modify\n3984\nthe necessary sentences in the story and re-\npeat the unrelated parts to include the given\nbackground information. ”\nRecall that each piece of evidence is a node in\nthe tree with b child nodes (except for the exter-\nnal nodes). These child nodes support it in dif-\nferent ways, making the information from those\nchild nodes mutually exclusive. If we incorporate\nmultiple chains into the story that are from the\nsame tree, it would contain contradictory pieces\nof evidence from one node’s different child nodes,\ncompromising the logical consistency of the nar-\nrative. Therefore, to ensure logical coherence and\navoid potential contradictions, we select only one\nevidence chain from each tree for inclusion in the\nfinal story.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Experimental Settings\nDatasets. Following Lu et al. (2023), we consider\nplot, mood, genre, and subject as target conditions.\nplot describes the events that must appear in the\ngenerated story. mood defines the expected emo-\ntional response of the reader after reading the gener-\nated story. genre dictates the desired story type and\nsubject indicates the subjects that should be men-\ntioned in the story. We randomly draw 50 prompts\nfrom the testing set of the WritingPrompt dataset\nfor plot. Following Lu et al. (2023), we consider\nhappy, angry, fearful, and sad formood. For genre,\nwe consider historical fiction, literary fiction, and\nscience fiction. Lover, cat, and survivor are for\nsubject. We experiment with all combinations of\nthese four types of control components across 1800\ntesting cases (derived from 50 prompts, 4 moods, 3\ngenres, and 3 subjects), ensuring that each type of\ncondition only appears once in each case. Besides,\nwe use the 1.5K unlabeled movie plot summaries\nfrom the IMDB movie details dataset 3 to build the\nretrieval repository.\nEvaluation Metrics. We follow the common\npractice in automatic story generation for evalu-\nation (Karpinska et al., 2021; Zhai et al., 2023)\nand measure the following 4 aspects:(1) Gram-\nmar: How grammatically correct is the text of the\nstory? (2) Coherence: How well do the sentences\nin the story fit together? (3) Likability: How en-\njoyable or appealing is the story to the readers? (4)\nRelevance: How closely does the story align with\n3www.kaggle.com/datasets/txgg123/imdb-movie-details\nthe target constraints? Additionally, we propose\ntwo new metrics tailored for evaluating stories with\ncomplex plots: (5) Complexity: How complex is\nthe plot structure in the story? (6) Creativity: How\ncreative is the story’s plot design?\nWe evaluate stories on these six metrics using\na 5-point Likert scale with human evaluation. We\nhire three evaluators with Master’s degrees in En-\nglish Literature from a commercial company to\nindependently evaluate 100 randomly sampled sto-\nries paired with instructions4. As Zhai et al. (2023)\nfound that LLMs can serve as a cheap alternative\nfor human evaluation, we evaluate each story in\nSec. 4.4 by querying ChatGPT three times using\nthe instructions in Zhai et al. (2023). We calculate\nthe average scores and variances for human and\nmodel-based evaluation respectively.\nBaselines. We compare our method against five\nbaselines: Human (Fan et al., 2018) is writ-\nten ground truth stories under the same prompts.\nICL (Xie et al., 2023) explicitly instructs an LLM\nto generate a story to satisfy target conditions and\ncontain many interesting plots. CoT follows the\nChain-of-Thought prompting strategy (Wei et al.,\n2022), where the LM is asked to follow specific\ninstructions, generate a story, identify the missing\ninformation, and iteratively revise the story to in-\nclude missing backgrounds step by step.Prompt-E\nperforms prompt engineering by modifying the in-\nstruction of ICL to obtain 4 variants that explicitly\nrequire creativity and complexity from the gener-\nated story and taking the average of their perfor-\nmance for evaluation. Specifically, it adds “Gen-\nerate a complex and creative story”, “Generate a\ndetailed and complex story”, “Ensure that the story\nis creative and rich in plots.”, and “Generate a long\nand complex story” to the ICL instruction, respec-\ntively. Story-S prompts the LLM to generate a\nstory multiple times. For each sample, we add up\nthe scores of six metrics to obtain the overall score\nand select the story with the highest overall score as\nthe final story. We use ChatGPT as the base model\nfor all the above methods for a fair comparison (im-\nplementation details are in App. C. As the API to\naccess GPT-4 model is hard to apply, which limits\nour ability to conduct large-scale experiments for\ndirect comparison. However, the theoretical under-\npinnings and method of our work remain applicable\nto GPT-4.\n4We do not use the commonly adopted AMT since Karpin-\nska et al. (2021) found that their results are questionable.\n3985\n4.2 Overall Performance\nTab. 1 shows the results of all methods of human\nevaluation in story generation. GROVE achieves\nthe best performance on almost all metrics. Hu-\nman baseline underperforms other automatic ap-\nproaches that are based on the same LLM (i.e.\nChatGPT), indicating the strong ability of LLM\nto produce high-quality stories. ICL generates a\nstory by instructing the LLM with target conditions.\nIt achieves the highest performance in Relevance\nand Grammar, indicating ChatGPT’s strong ability\nto follow instructions and generate correct English.\nCompared to GROVE, ICL produces the least com-\nplex stories under both human and automatic eval-\nuation, which means that directly instructing the\nLLM with target conditions struggles to generate\ncomplex stories. CoT self-improves the story in a\nsingle output step-by-step by asking and answering\nquestions about the initial story and rewriting it to\nobtain the final story. CoT generates slightly more\ncomplex and likable stories than ICL. It shows that\nChain-of-Thought prompting is effective in improv-\ning the story’s complexity and fondness. However,\nCoT is still worse than GROVE on all metrics be-\ncause it is challenging for ChatGPT to execute all\nsteps in a single output 5. We find in our experi-\nments that the story quality of Story-S is highly\ninconsistent among different generations. Besides,\neven if it is possible to obtain complex and cre-\native stories, Story-S cannot diversify or prolong\none particular user-desired story. GROVE bene-\nfits from the retrieval-augmented approach and the\nasking-why prompting scheme. Since it introduces\nmore complex plots, GROVE inevitably incorpo-\nrates additional information into the story that may\nbe irrelevant to the target conditions. While pro-\nducing slightly less relevant stories than ICL, it\nstill scores high on Relevance and achieves the\nbest performance in the rest metrics. We also con-\nduct prompt engineering on GROVE and obtain\nGROVE (Prompt-E), which further improves its\nstory generation ability.\n4.3 Ablation study\nTab. 2 shows the human evaluation results of the\nablation studies on our proposed components and\nverifies their effectiveness. −Retrieve generates\nstories without referring to relevant few-shot ex-\n5We calculate that CoT fails to finish the required number\nof iterations for evidence generation before generating the\nfinal story in more than 40% of the testing cases.\namples. −Retrieve underperforms GROVE in all\nmetrics, especially on Relevance. The performance\ndrop indicates that the retrieval enhances the un-\nderstanding of desirable outputs and helps generate\ncoherent and relevant stories. −Rewrite skips the\nevidence-based story rewriting, which deepens the\nstorylines and explores untold backgrounds and in-\ndepth rationale. The drop in Complexity shows that\nthe stories generated without rewriting lack a cer-\ntain depth and complexity, thus validating the im-\nportance of evidence-based rewriting in enriching\nstory complexity. As −Rewrite generates without\nexploring deeper details, resulting in stories that\nmore closely stick to the given instruction, thus\ndemonstrating a slight advantage over GROVE in\nRelevance. However, the Relevance of GROVE re-\nmains high, even while scoring high in Complexity.\n−Select omits to select optimal evidence chains\nand incorporate all evidence into the final stories.\nThe lack of evidence filtration introduces unrelated\nand conflicting information, producing verbose and\nillogical stories with decreased Coherence and Rel-\nevance. Furthermore, the drop in Complexity and\nCreativity indicates the importance of the selection\nprocess in refining the stories’ complexity and origi-\nnality. Given the initial stories,−Evidence directly\ninstructs the LLM to include the necessary details\nto revise the stories. −Evidence enables story re-\nvisions. However, without explicitly prompting the\nLLM with the necessary information, it may add\ninsignificant details that hardly improve the story\nquality. + Evidence increases the number of evi-\ndence trees thereby improving Complexity, while\npossibly making the generated stories too specific,\nthereby affecting Likability. Inserting a fixed com-\nplex story into the prompt (Fixed Story) leads to\nunstable performance. It decreases the stories’ Co-\nherence, Likability, and Relevance, echoing the\ndiscoveries of Shi et al. (2023) and Zhang et al.\n(2022a) that irrelevant or random samples distract\nLLM, thereby hurting performance.\n4.4 Generalization Ability\nWe verify the generalization ability of GROVE on a\nmuch smaller open-source LLM (i.e. Alpaca-Plus-\n7B (Cui et al., 2023)). Due to the high computa-\ntional costs of many LLMs, exploring smaller mod-\nels provides a more affordable option for smaller\nteams. We apply GROVE on Alpaca-Plus-7B (Al-\npaca) to compare with a simple baseline ICL in\nTab. 3 and showcase its generation results to com-\n3986\nMethods \\MetricsGrammar Coherence Likability Relevance Complexity Creativity\nMeanSTDIAA(%) MeanSTDIAA(%) MeanSTDIAA(%) MeanSTDIAA(%)MeanSTDIAA(%) MeanSTDIAA(%)\nHuman 3.530.65 14 3.32 0.71 39 2.99 0.82 20 3.63 1.01 17 3.050.80 8 2.93 0.79 27\nICL 4.040.47 43 3.90 0.47 43 3.22 0.96 6 4.470.73 19 3.340.57 15 3.21 0.52 19\nCoT 3.691.01 33 3.83 1.13 12 3.31 0.98 24 3.83 1.26 13 3.421.09 13 3.15 0.96 18\nPrompt-E 3.980.48 35 3.94 0.52 29 3.39 0.87 20 4.17 0.86 19 3.441.12 17 3.23 0.77 18\nStory-S 4.120.45 48 4.17 0.79 18 3.38 0.54 26 4.28 0.96 23 3.531.16 16 3.42 0.94 17\nGROVE 3.980.56 32 4.220.61 26 3.55 0.63 11 4.25 0.73 20 3.570.61 10 3.40 0.55 29\nGROVE (Prompt-E)3.940.63 28 4.15 0.57 37 3.610.97* 23 4.34 0.88 20 3.610.78* 18 3.570.56* 26\nTable 1: Human evaluation results of all methods.

Results second to the\nbest are with underlines.\npare with that of ChatGPT in Tab. 4 (see full results\nin Tab. 9 and Tab. 10). GROVE improves the gen-\neration quality of Alpaca on almost all metrics. For\nthe same instruction, ChatGPT generates an initial\nstory satisfying all desired control conditions. In\ncontrast, the initial story generated by Alpaca only\nmeets part of the target conditions (subject and\ngenre) and struggles to satisfy the rest (plot and\nmood). Both final stories incorporate the informa-\ntion from the evidence chains, however, ChatGPT\nfuses the information in a more natural and coher-\nent way. The performance gap between the two\nmodels is understandable because Alpaca’s scale\nof model size and training data is much smaller\nthan ChatGPT, thus possessing a relatively limited\ncapacity to handle multiple, complex instructions.\nDespite the relatively poor controllability of Al-\npaca, GROVE is still helpful in providing complex\nstories with rich information.\n4.5 Plot Enumeration Analysis\nWe propose a model-based evaluation method to\ncalculate the average number of story plots for dif-\nferent baselines, which verifies that GROVE gen-\nerates complex stories with rich plots (see Tab. 5).\nWe randomly sample 100 stories generated by each\nbaseline respectively. Then, we construct a prompt\ntemplate that instructs the LLM to generate a list\nof plots for each story. The prompt template is:\n“Here is a story: [STORY]. Give me an organized\nlist of sentences, each of which describes one plot. ”\nWe fill the template with each story, feed it into\nthe LLM, and count the number of plots from the\nLLM’s output. Finally, for each method, we calcu-\nlate the average number of plots across all tested\nstories. GROVE outperforms other methods in\ngenerating complex stories, with the highest aver-\nage number of plots per story. This underscores\nGROVE’s effectiveness in creating multiple com-\nplex and engaging storylines, thereby enhancing\nthe depth and variety of story generation.\n4.6 Plagiarism Detection\nWe evaluate the potential intellectual property in-\nfringements of our generated stories through N-\ngram overlap and plagiarism detection.

We design an algorithm that iteratively\nprompts LLM to obtain a forest of evidence that\ncompensates for the generated story. Moreover, we\nrevise the story by referring to the most relevant\nchains of evidence. Experimental results show that\nour proposed method outperforms strong baselines\nin ensuring story complexity and creativity.\n6 Acknowledgement\nThis work is supported by the following foun-\ndations: the National Natural Science Founda-\ntion of China under Grant No.62025208 and\nNo.62306330, and the Xiangjiang Laboratory\nFoundation under Grant No.22XJ01012.\nReferences\nAmal Alabdulkarim, Siyan Li, and Xiangyu Peng. 2021.\nAutomatic story generation: Challenges and attempts.\nIn WNU, pages 72–83, Virtual.

Large language models are human-level\nprompt engineers.\nA Limitations\nOur approach heavily relies on the capability of\nthe underlying LLM, which means improvements\nin story complexity and coherence may be con-\nstrained by the LLM’s inherent limitations. Further-\nmore, it may introduce bias if certain types of evi-\ndence or narrative chains are favored by the LLM,\nimpacting the diversity of generated stories. We\nencourage future works to analyze the inner work-\nings of LLMs and more effective control strategies\nfor better understanding and utilization.\nB Ethics Statement\nOur proposed method aims to generate a complex\nstory with given target conditions. We hope that our\nwork can inspire future studies on controllable text\ngeneration. We acknowledge that GROVE poses\npotential harm when it is used with malicious in-\ntentions. Firstly, one may use GROVE to guide the\ngeneration to produce biased or harmful informa-\ntion. Secondly, using existing stories for retrieval\nmay violate copyright laws if improperly handled,\nso attention to data sourcing and fair use principles\nis essential. Appropriate debiasing measures and\ncontent moderation strategies can alleviate these\npotential negative impacts. We encourage future\nresearch to study these issues.\nC Implementation Details\nFor our experiments with ChatGPT, we access the\ngpt-3.5-turbo model by API calls. we set the num-\nber of few-shot examples k to 1. During story\ngeneration, We set the number of ambiguities N,\nthe number of iterations I, and the evidence num-\nber b to 2. We resample another prompt from the\nWritingPrompt dataset when ChatGPT repeatedly\nrefuses to generate a story for the given prompt.\nWe calculate the average of their performance on\nthe automatic evaluation. During the automatic\nevaluation, we construct the instructions for Com-\nplexity and Creativity following the same format\nin Zhai et al. (2023) and keep feeding the same\ninstruction to ChatGPT until it provides a rating. In\nSec. 4.4, we set Nand I to 1 for Alpaca and Chat-\nGPT for a fair comparison.

Among them was\nCaptain Felix, a respected hero who had dedicated his life to protecting the space stations from any threats\nthat may come their way. However, one day, as Captain Felix was going through the records of the space\nstations, he discovered a dark secret that had been kept hidden for years. The space stations had been\nconducting secret experiments on cats, using them as test subjects for a new technology that could save\nhumanity. The cats were subjected to extreme pain and suffering in the name of science....He knew it was\nwrong, but the technology could mean the salvation of humanity. As he struggled with his moral compass,\nhe began to question everything he once believed in. Felix knew that he had to take matters into his own\nhands. He started to work on the technology himself, using the cats that survived the experiments. ...As\nhe continued to conduct experiments on the cats, their pitiful cries and suffering weighed heavily on his\nconscience. He began to distance himself from his crew members, becoming a lonely and isolated figure in\nthe space station. In the end, Captain Felix succeeded in creating the technology, but at a great cost. He had\nbecome a morally questionable antihero, abandoning his former values and beliefs. The cats, once beloved\npets and cherished companions, were now nothing more than tools for his scientific endeavors. ...He could\nnot help but wonder if there could have been another way. He vowed to make things right, to ensure that no\nother living being would suffer as the cats had. ...He knew that he could not undo the harm he had caused to\nthe cats, but he could prevent further harm from being done. ...Despite his newfound reputation as a defender\nof animal rights, however, Captain Felix still carried the guilt of his past actions with him. He knew that\nhe could never fully make amends for what he had done, but he hoped that his work in the field of animal\nwelfare would go some way towards atoning for his past mistakes. ...\nTable 12: Demonstration of generated stories from different methods.

They are the rulers of the land,\nand the humans are their loyal servants. The cats were believed to hold supernatural abilities by a group of\ninfluential cat owners who founded The Church of the Feline Gods. Every human must worship and obey the\ndivine cats in this new world. The protagonist, Sarah, is a devout follower of the Church. She has spent her\nentire life serving the cats and has even adopted a stray kitten to show her devotion. But one day, something\nchanges within Sarah. As she watches a group of cats casually bat around a mouse for entertainment, she\nbegins to see the cruelty in their behavior.She realizes that these so-called gods are nothing but selfish tyrants\nwho enjoy the suffering of others. Determined to take revenge, Sarah embarks on a dangerous journey to\nbecome a god herself. Now, as a new god, Sarah uses her powers to exact justice on the feline rulers. She\nturns their own tricks against them, making them suffer as they once made the humans suffer. However,\nSarah’s anger gets the better of her, and she becomes a cruel tyrant herself. She realizes too late that power\ncorrupts, and that revenge only leads to more suffering. As the story concludes, the reader is left to wonder\nwho the true gods are in this world. The cats who rule with an iron paw, or the humans who struggle to\nsurvive beneath their tyranny. The answer remains elusive. As Sarah’s power grew, so did her ambition.\nShe became obsessed with taking down the feline gods and establishing herself as the supreme ruler of the\nland. ...She could manipulate reality and bend it to her will. But with great power comes great responsibility,\nand Sarah couldn’t handle it. ...The humans, who had once looked up to Sarah as their savior, now lived in\nfear of her wrath. The few who dared to oppose her were swiftly and brutally punished. The cats who had\nonce been tyrants were now victims of her cruelty. The influential cat owners who had helped Sarah gain\nher powers realized their mistake, but it was too late. They couldn’t control Sarah anymore. They tried to\nstop her, but with her godlike abilities, she was too powerful. In the end, Sarah found herself all alone in\nher throne room, her dreams of power and glory shattered. She had become what she once hated the most –\na ruthless dictator. With a heavy heart, she realized that she had sacrificed everything she held dear in her\npursuit of revenge. The once devout follower of the Feline Gods had become the epitome of evil. As the sun\nset on this land, the future remained uncertain. Will another rise to take Sarah’s place, or will the humans\nfinally break free from the tyranny of cats or gods? Only time will tell.\nTable 13: Demonstration of generated stories from different methods. Prompt describes the target conditions.
