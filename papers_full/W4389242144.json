McCaughran \n \n, \nMatthew J. Metcalfe \n1.\n Vascular Surgery, Lister Hospital, Stevenage, GBR\nCorresponding author: \nOmar Haidar, \nomar.haidar@nhs.net\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nEnsuring access to high-quality information is paramount to facilitating informed surgical decision-making.\nThe use of the internet to access health-related information is increasing, along with the growing prevalence\nof AI language models such as ChatGPT. We aim to assess the standard of AI-generated patient-facing\ninformation through a qualitative analysis of its readability and quality.\nMaterials and methods\nWe performed a retrospective qualitative analysis of information regarding three common vascular\nprocedures: endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), and femoro-popliteal\nbypass (FPBP). The ChatGPT responses were compared to patient information leaflets provided by the\nvascular charity, Circulation Foundation UK. Readability was assessed using four readability scores: the\nFlesch-Kincaid reading ease (FKRE) score, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level (FKGL), the Gunning fog score\n(GFS), and the simple measure of gobbledygook (SMOG) index. Quality was assessed using the DISCERN tool\nby two independent assessors.\nResults\nThe mean FKRE score was 33.3, compared to 59.1 for the information provided by the Circulation Foundation\n(SD=14.5, p=0.025) indicating poor readability of AI-generated information. The FFKGL indicated that the\nexpected grade of students likely to read and understand ChatGPT responses was consistently higher than\ncompared to information leaflets at 12.7 vs. 9.4 (SD=1.9, p=0.002). Two metrics measure readability in terms\nof the number of years of education required to understand a piece of writing: the GFS and SMOG. Both\nscores indicated that AI-generated answers were less accessible. The GFS for ChatGPT-provided information\nwas 16.7 years versus 12.8 years for the leaflets (SD=2.2, p=0.002) and the SMOG index scores were 12.2 and\n9.4 years for ChatGPT and the patient information leaflets, respectively (SD=1.7, p=0.001). The DISCERN\nscores were consistently higher in human-generated patient information leaflets compared to AI-generated\ninformation across all procedures; the mean score for the information provided by ChatGPT was 50.3 vs. 56.0\nfor the Circulation Foundation information leaflets (SD=3.38, p<0.001).\nConclusion\nWe concluded that AI-generated information about vascular surgical procedures is currently poor in both the\nreadability of text and the quality of information. Patients should be directed to reputable, human-generated\ninformation sources from trusted professional bodies to supplement direct education from the clinician\nduring the pre-procedure consultation process.\nCategories:\n Cardiac/Thoracic/Vascular Surgery, Medical Education, Healthcare Technology\nKeywords:\n chatgpt, patient education, ai, artificial intelligence, vascular\nIntroduction\nAs we progress through the ‘information age’, there is an increasing number of sources through which\npatients can learn about their pathology and the treatment options available to them. Despite this volume\nincreasing, there can be no assurances as to its quality. Large variances exist in both the form and content of\npatient-facing educational material \n[1]\n. Ensuring access to high-quality information is paramount to\nfacilitating informed surgical decision-making for patients undergoing vascular procedures.\nArtificial intelligence\nOne increasingly popular method of gathering information is through the utilization of artificial intelligence\n1\n1\n1\n1\n \n Open Access Original\nArticle\n \nDOI:\n 10.7759/cureus.49764\nHow to cite this article\nHaidar O, Jaques A, McCaughran P W, et al. (November 30, 2023) AI-Generated Information for Vascular Patients: Assessing the Standard of\nProcedure-Specific Information Provided by the ChatGPT AI-Language Model. Cureus 15(11): e49764. \nDOI 10.7759/cureus.49764\n(AI). ChatGPT is an AI large language model (LLM) created by OpenAI (San Francisco, CA, USA) \n[2]\n, which\nhas been trained with information input from a wide variety of publicly available sources, including books,\narticles, and websites. Once a query is inputted, ChatGPT uses its language model to organize this data into\na coherent, grammatical, and contextually correct answer. Since its release in November 2022, it has been\nreported to have received over 1.5 billion page visits \n[3]\n. The use of AI is established in many consumer-\nfacing roles, i.e., customer support or virtual assistance, and is increasingly being deployed in the healthcare\nsector. In 2023, the UK government announced £100 million into the \nAI Life Sciences Accelerator Mission\n to\nutilize AI in the National Health Service \n[4]\n.\nResearch has been completed on the possible uses of ChatGPT for the vascular clinician. In a comprehensive\nliterature review, Fischer et al. explored the uses of AI and machine learning in vascular diagnostics,\nperioperative risk stratification, and outcome prediction \n[5]\n. The technology is still relatively nascent in\nthese fields, requiring further clinical validation and integration into healthcare systems. Our search found\nno literature on the use of AI in patient health information acquisition.\nPatient education\nThe ultimate responsibility for ensuring adequately informed patient decision-making lies with the\nconsenting clinician per the Royal College of Surgeons of England’s (RCSE) Good Surgical Practice\nguidelines on consent \n[6]\n. Supplementary materials have long been used to facilitate patient education,\nnamely information leaflets, educational videos, and increasingly, webpages and internet resources. Their\nuse is explicitly endorsed in the RCSE guidelines. Artificial intelligence language models also have the\npotential to educate, whether the patient is directed there by the clinician or not.\nThe quality of information available on the internet to educate vascular patients was first investigated in\n1999 by Soot et al., who analyzed the 50 most common websites encountered when searching for common\nvascular pathologies on search engines. They remarked that “overall quality is poor, and information is\ndifficult to obtain in part because of the large number of irrelevant sites” \n[7]\n. The question was revisited in\n2012 by Grewal et al., who repeated a similar study, analyzing common websites encountered by major\nsearch engines \n[8]\n. They analyzed readability through the FKRE score, the Gunning fog index, and the LIDA\ntool to assess reliability; they concluded that “internet information on vascular surgical conditions and\nprocedures is poorly written and unreliable,” indicating little progression 13 years on. As online resources\nhave developed a decade on from Grewal et al.’s study, and with the recent introduction of AI language\nmodels claiming to be able to present this growing information pool in a readable and conversational\nmanner, the question of the internet’s ability to inform the vascular patient population is worth revisiting.\nMaterials And Methods\nWe performed a retrospective qualitative assessment of documents intended for patient use, comparing\nthose generated by AI and those produced by human writing. The Circulation Foundation is a UK-registered\ncharity (Charity Number 1102769) and a division of the United Kingdom’s Vascular Society \n[9]\n. Patient\ninformation leaflets were accessed in July 2023 regarding three commonly performed vascular procedures\ncovering domains of aortic, peripheral artery, and venous pathology. These were endovascular aortic repair\n(EVAR) \n[10]\n, femoro-popliteal bypass (FPBP) \n[11]\n, and endovenous laser therapy (EVLA) \n[12]\n. ChatGPT, the AI\nLLM developed by OpenAI using the GPT-3.5 framework \n[2]\n, was also accessed in the same month, i.e., July\n2023. The input questions were as follows: “I am a patient who has been offered [Vascular Procedure]. What\nshould I know before agreeing to have this procedure?” Responses were then extracted (see Appendix A-C)\nand assessed for readability and quality.\nAssessments of standard\nReadability was assessed using the FKRE score, FKGL, GFS, and the SMOG index. Scores were derived from\nthe WebFX (Harrisburg, PA, USA) online readability test \n[13]\n. Data is presented as raw values and means. The\nFKRE score is given on a scale of 0-100, with higher scores signifying better readability. Score creators\nrecommend a target score of 65 or higher. The FKGL is an estimation of the education grade (as per the\nAmerican education system) required to understand a piece of writing. A lower score indicates more readily\naccessible information. A recommended target for general audiences is 7th grade or lower. The GFS and\nSMOG are both measures referring to the years of education required to comprehend material. Once again, a\nlower score indicates better readability.\nQuality assessments were performed using the DISCERN tool by two independent assessors (AJ and PM).\nScores are presented as raw scores out of 80, and means were also calculated. Inter-rater reliability was\nassessed using Cronbach’s alpha score of reliability.\nNormality was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of normality (see Appendix D). The data was\nfound to be normally distributed, so parametric tests were used. Graphing and statistical analysis were\nperformed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA).\nResults\n2023 Haidar et al. Cureus 15(11): e49764. DOI 10.7759/cureus.49764\n2\n of \n10\nReadability metrics for AI-generated answers were low across all procedures (Table \n1\n). The mean FKRE score\nwas 33.3, compared to 59.1 for the information provided by the Circulation Foundation (SD=14.5, p=0.025).\nNo information surpassed the benchmark score of 65 as detailed by the metric creators as a good level for the\ngeneral population. The FKGL indicated that the expected grade of students likely to read and understand\nChatGPT responses was consistently higher than compared to information leaflets at 12.7 vs. 9.4 (SD=1.9,\np=0.002).

When compared to\nthe benchmark of information written by humans and tailored to vascular patient audiences, ChatGPT\nresponses were inferior both in readability and quality of information. Clinicians should continue to direct\npatients to these resources and remember that the ultimate responsibility for educating patients during the\nconsenting process lies with them.\nMaterial risks\nBeyond discussions regarding the quality of information provided by AI, it is important at this stage to recall\nthe landmark case of Montgomery vs. Lanarkshire Health Board \n[14]\n, which defined a duty of care on\nclinicians to make patients aware of all \nmaterial risks\n. The case defined materiality as “a reasonable person\nin the patient’s position would be likely to attach significance to the risk, or the doctor is or should\nreasonably be aware that the particular patient would be likely to attach significance to it” \n[14]\n. Focusing on\nthe latter half of this statement, we are reminded that direct clinician input is required to tailor all\n2023 Haidar et al. Cureus 15(11): e49764. DOI 10.7759/cureus.49764\n3\n of \n10\neducation to the particular situation of the patient. The distribution of informational resources is no\nreplacement for direct clinician input, but they are there to be used as a reminder and supplemental reading\nfor the patient.\nGuidelines for use\nThe RCSE details guidelines on consent in Section 3.5.1 of Good Surgical Practice \n[6]\n. It states:\n“Where possible, you should provide written information to patients to enable them to reflect and\nconfirm their decision. You should also provide advice on how they can obtain further information to\nunderstand the procedure and their condition. This can include information such as patient leaflets,\ndecision aids, websites and educational videos.”\nOur study recommends that, while adhering to these guidelines, vascular surgeons should not be directing\npatients to AI LLMs for further information. As detailed by the RCSE, patient leaflets from reputable\nprofessional bodies should remain the standard for supplementary patient education. Currently, no\nguidelines are readily available for the use of AI in surgery from any UK professional surgical body; however,\nthese issues span beyond just the field of vascular surgery. Similar poor outcomes for readability were found\nin Momenaei et al.'s study assessing AI-generated information on retinal disease \n[15]\n and Musheyev et al.'s\nstudy regarding urological malignancies \n[16]\n.\nInterestingly, both studies found the information to be accurate and appropriate in content, which was not\nreproduced in our findings in vascular surgery. This discrepancy indicates potential specialty-dependent\ninconsistencies in the quality of data used to inform answers. We recommend further investigation into the\ncurrent use of AI by clinicians and patients across specialties and to dissuade their further use until the\nquality of the information can be reliably and reproducibly assured. Additionally, given that this difference\nexists between surgical specialties, it may also exist between subjects within the same field. Further research\nis required to determine inter- and intra-specialty differences in the accuracy of AI-generated information.\nQuality assurance\nThe topic of data quality from AI was discussed at the National Institute of Health workshop held in 2019\n[17]\n. The panel concluded that the trustworthiness of AI in healthcare is currently impeded by data quality;\nthis finding is reproduced in our analysis. If AI is to be integrated into the domain of patient education,\nfurther clinical input should be sought to define the data sets that AI uses to source information as well as\nquality assurance for patient-facing output. We echo the call from Park et al. for further clinical validation\nthrough a study into the current state of AI in healthcare \n[18]\n. Just as with any tool or intervention, research\nmust be conducted to determine the validity of AI-generated information before its endorsed integration\ninto health systems, and repeated quality assurance must be undertaken as these systems evolve.\nLimitations\nThis study utilized ChatGPT based on the GPT-3.5 framework. OpenAI has released GPT-4 and integrated a\nnewer iteration. However, this is restricted behind a paywall of $20 per month as part of ChatGPT Plus \n[19]\n.\nOpenAI reports that GPT-4 is “40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 on our internal\nevaluations\" \n[19]\n. We decided to use the free-to-use version that is more readily accessible to patients and\ntherefore more likely to represent the experience of patients turning to LLM’s to research proposed vascular\nprocedures. Similarly, within the same iteration of ChatGPT, answers may contain slight differences when\nasked on different occasions. Scores may have differed if queries were requested at different times.\nThe formulae of the four readability metrics used commonly rely on the same two parameters in their\nassessments, i.e., syllables per word and words per sentence. While providing an objective metric that is\nuseful to facilitate direct comparison, it cannot always be assumed that shorter words are simpler to\ncomprehend. This highlights an important distinction to note between the readability and understandability\nof language \n[20]\n. Outside of formulaic approaches, eye-movement tracking is an alternative proposed\nmethod of readability assessment \n[21]\n and is an exciting avenue for potential further study to assess the\nreproducibility of findings.\nConclusions\nArtificial intelligence-generated information was found to be comparatively poor in both readability and\nquality when compared to existing educational material from human experts. Vascular clinicians should\nfavor patient information leaflets from reputable professional institutions when directing patients to\nsupplementary educational material. Further regulation is required to standardize the data input into AI\nlanguage models and audit the quality of patient-facing output before it can be utilized safely and effectively\nas an educational resource.\n2023 Haidar et al. Cureus 15(11): e49764. DOI 10.7759/cureus.49764\n4\n of \n10\nAppendices\nAppendix A \nChatGPT Information on EVAR\nPrompt: \nI am a patient who has been offered Endovascular Aortic Aneurysm Repair. What should I know\nbefore agreeing to have this procedure?\nAnswer:\nAs an AI language model, I can provide you with some general information about Endovascular\nAortic Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) to help you understand the procedure. However, please note that I'm\nnot a doctor, so it's important to consult with a qualified healthcare professional who can provide\nyou with personalized medical advice based on your specific condition. Here are some key points to\nconsider and discuss with your healthcare provider:\n1. What is Endovascular Aortic Aneurysm Repair (EVAR)?\n   - EVAR is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat an aortic aneurysm, which is a bulging or\nweakening of the wall of the aorta (the main blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest\nof the body).\n   - During EVAR, a stent graft (a fabric tube supported by a metal frame) is inserted into the\nweakened area of the aorta to reinforce it and prevent the aneurysm from rupturing.\n2. Suitability for EVAR:\n   - Not all aortic aneurysms are suitable for EVAR. Factors such as the size, shape, and location of the\naneurysm, as well as the condition of the blood vessels, need to be evaluated to determine if you are\na candidate for the procedure.\n   - Your healthcare provider will assess your medical history, perform imaging tests (such as CT\nscans or ultrasound), and consider other factors before recommending EVAR.\n3. Benefits of EVAR:\n   - EVAR is a less invasive alternative to traditional open surgery for aortic aneurysm repair.\n   - The procedure is associated with a shorter hospital stay, reduced recovery time, and less post-\noperative pain compared to open surgery.\n   - The risk of complications, such as infection and blood loss, may be lower with EVAR.\n4. Potential risks and complications:\n   - While EVAR generally has a lower risk profile than open surgery, there are still potential risks and\ncomplications involved.\n   - These may include injury to blood vessels during the procedure, leakage around the stent graft\n(endoleak), infection, blood clots, aneurysm rupture, and the need for additional procedures or\ninterventions.\n   - Long-term follow-up is usually required to monitor the durability of the stent graft and identify\nany potential complications that may arise over time.\n2023 Haidar et al. Cureus 15(11): e49764. DOI 10.7759/cureus.49764\n5\n of \n10\n5. Alternatives and considerations:\n   - Open surgical repair: Discuss with your healthcare provider the possibility of open surgery as an\nalternative to EVAR. They can explain the pros and cons of each approach based on your specific\nsituation.\n   - Lifestyle modifications: Depending on the size and progression of the aneurysm, your healthcare\nprovider may recommend monitoring it regularly through imaging tests and making lifestyle changes\nto manage risk factors such as high blood pressure and smoking.\n6. Post-operative care and follow-up:\n   - It's important to understand the post-operative care instructions and follow them diligently.\n   - You may need regular follow-up appointments and imaging tests to monitor the success of the\nprocedure and detect any potential complications.\nRemember, this information is a general overview, and your healthcare provider will provide you\nwith more detailed information based on your specific condition. It's essential to have an open and\nthorough discussion with your doctor to ensure you fully understand the procedure, risks, benefits,\nand any alternatives available to you.\nAppendix B\nChatGPT Information on EVLA\nPrompt:\nI am a patient who has been offered Endovenous Laser Ablation Therapy. What should I know before\nagreeing to have this procedure?\nAnswer: \nEndovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA) therapy is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat varicose\nveins. Before agreeing to have this procedure, there are several important factors to consider. Here's\nwhat you should know:\n1. Varicose Vein Evaluation: It's crucial to undergo a thorough evaluation by a qualified healthcare\nprofessional, usually a vascular specialist or a vascular surgeon, who can assess the severity of your\nvaricose veins and determine if EVLA is the appropriate treatment for your condition. They will\nexamine your medical history, perform a physical examination, and may order diagnostic tests like\nultrasound to evaluate the veins.\n2. Procedure Overview: EVLA involves the use of laser energy to close off and seal abnormal veins.\nDuring the procedure, a thin laser fiber is inserted into the affected vein through a small incision.\nThe laser emits heat, which causes the vein to collapse and seal shut. Blood flow is then naturally\nrerouted to healthier veins.\n3. Benefits: EVLA offers several potential benefits, including improved cosmetic appearance by\nreducing the appearance of varicose veins, relief from symptoms like pain, swelling, and leg\nheaviness, and potential prevention of complications associated with varicose veins such as ulcers\nand blood clots.\n4. Risks and Complications: While EVLA is generally safe, it's important to be aware of potential\nrisks and complications. These can include temporary bruising, swelling, numbness, or pain in the\ntreated area. In rare cases, infection, blood clot formation, nerve injury, skin burns, or deep vein\n2023 Haidar et al. Cureus 15(11): e49764. DOI 10.7759/cureus.49764\n6\n of \n10\nthrombosis (DVT) may occur.\n5. Recovery and Downtime: The recovery period after EVLA is usually shorter compared to traditional\nvein stripping surgery. You may be able to resume normal activities within a day or two, although it's\nrecommended to avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting for a few weeks. Your healthcare\nprovider will provide specific post-procedure instructions.\n6. Alternatives and Combination Treatments: EVLA may not be suitable for everyone, and in some\ncases, alternative treatments or a combination of therapies may be recommended. Other treatment\noptions for varicose veins include sclerotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, and ambulatory\nphlebectomy. Discuss these alternatives with your healthcare provider to determine the best\napproach for your specific situation.\n7. Success Rates and Long-Term Outcomes: EVLA has shown high success rates in treating varicose\nveins, with improvement in symptoms and cosmetic appearance. However, it's essential to have\nrealistic expectations. Some patients may require multiple sessions or additional treatments to\nachieve optimal results. Varicose veins can recur over time, especially if underlying factors like\nobesity or prolonged standing are not addressed.\n8. Cost and Insurance Coverage: Check with your healthcare provider and insurance company\nregarding the cost of EVLA therapy and whether it's covered by your insurance plan. Insurance\ncoverage can vary, and you may need pre-authorization or meet specific criteria for reimbursement.\nRemember to have a thorough discussion with your healthcare provider, ask questions, and address\nany concerns you may have before making an informed decision about undergoing Endovenous Laser\nAblation therapy.\nAppendix C\nChatGPT Information on FPBP \nPrompt:\nI am a patient who has been offered Femoro-popliteal Bypass Surgery What should I know before\nagreeing to have this procedure?\nAnswer:\nFemoro-popliteal bypass surgery, also known as lower extremity bypass surgery, is a surgical\nprocedure performed to improve blood flow in the lower limbs by bypassing blocked or narrowed\narteries. Before agreeing to have this procedure, there are several important things you should know:\n1. Diagnosis and indications: Understand why your doctor is recommending femoro-popliteal bypass\nsurgery. This procedure is typically recommended for patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD)\nor severe peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) who experience symptoms such as leg pain,\nnon-healing wounds, or decreased mobility due to reduced blood flow.\n2. Risks and complications: Like any surgical procedure, femoro-popliteal bypass surgery carries\ncertain risks and potential complications. These can include infection, bleeding, blood clots, graft\nfailure, nerve injury, and heart or lung problems. Your doctor should discuss these risks with you and\naddress any concerns you may have.\n3. Alternatives: It's important to explore alternative treatment options before opting for surgery.\nDepending on your condition, these alternatives may include lifestyle modifications (such as quitting\nsmoking, exercise, and dietary changes), medication management, or minimally invasive procedures\nlike angioplasty or stenting.\n2023 Haidar et al. Cureus 15(11): e49764. DOI 10.7759/cureus.49764\n7\n of \n10\n4. Preoperative preparation: Prior to the surgery, your healthcare team will guide you through\npreoperative instructions. This may include fasting for a certain period before the procedure,\nstopping certain medications or supplements, and providing information about any allergies or\nmedical conditions you may have.\n5. Anesthesia: Femoro-popliteal bypass surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia,\nmeaning you will be unconscious during the procedure. An anesthesiologist will be responsible for\nadministering and monitoring the anesthesia to ensure your safety.\n6. Hospital stay and recovery: Following the surgery, you will typically be required to stay in the\nhospital for a few days. Your healthcare team will monitor your progress, manage pain, and provide\npostoperative care instructions. You may need to wear compression stockings and take medication to\nprevent blood clots. A rehabilitation program might be recommended to aid your recovery and\nrestore strength and mobility.\n7. Long-term follow-up: After the surgery, regular follow-up visits with your healthcare provider will\nbe necessary to monitor your progress and assess the success of the bypass. It's essential to attend\nthese appointments and report any concerns or changes in your symptoms.\n8. Lifestyle changes: Femoro-popliteal bypass surgery is not a cure for the underlying condition.
