    "abstract": "In recent years, with the extensive application of deep learning in images, the task of remote sensing image change detection has witnessed a significant improvement. Several excellent methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks and emerging transformer-based methods have achieved impressive accuracy. However, Convolutional Neural Network-based approaches have difficulties in capturing long-range dependencies because of their natural limitations in effective receptive field acquisition unless deeper networks are employed, introducing other drawbacks such as an increased number of parameters and loss of shallow information. The transformer-based methods can effectively learn the relationship between different regions, but the computation is inefficient. Thus, in this paper, a multi-scale feature aggregation via transformer (MFATNet) is proposed for remote sensing image change detection. To obtain a more accurate change map after learning the intra-relationships of feature maps at different scales through the transformer, MFATNet aggregates the multi-scale features. Moreover, the Spatial Semantic Tokenizer (SST) is introduced to obtain refined semantic tokens before feeding into the transformer structure to make it focused on learning more crucial pixel relationships. To fuse low-level features (more fine-grained localization information) and high-level features (more accurate semantic information), and to alleviate the localization and semantic gap between high and low features, the Intra- and Inter-class Channel Attention Module (IICAM) are integrated to further determine more convincing change maps. Extensive experiments are conducted on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD datasets. Intersection over union (IoU) of 82.42 and F1 score of 90.36, intersection over union (IoU) of 79.08 and F1 score of 88.31, intersection over union (IoU) of 77.98 and F1 score of 87.62, respectively, are achieved. The experimental results achieved promising performance compared to certain previous state-of-the-art change detection methods.",
