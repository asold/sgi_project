INTRODUCTION \neliable monitoring and diagnostic techniques for  \ndetecting transformer incipient faults are required in order \nto help avoiding catastrophic failures , and to inform an \nefficient predictive maintenance program which improves the \nreliability of the equipment [1, 2] . The overall health of an \noperating transformer depends largely on the condition of its \ninsulation system [3]. Long term degradation of an insulation \nsystem occurs mainly through heating (pyrolysis), moisture  \ningress (hydrolysis) and air ingress (oxidation) [4, 5]. Incipient \nfaults within a transformer can be detected by analyzing \nsamples of its insulating oil, e.g., using dissolved gas analysis \nand furan analysis [6]-[8]. Interfacial tension (IFT) and acid \nnumber measurements may also be used to examine the oil \nquality [9]. Although p olar compounds in transformer oil  \nusually have little or no acidity, they can react to form acids \nwhich increase the rate of insulation paper ageing.  IFT and \nacid number measurements can therefore provide early \nwarning of such ageing [10].  \nThe ASTM D971 standard (Interfacial Tension of Oil \nagainst Water by the Ring Method) is widely used to measure \nIFT of insulating oil [11 ], [12]. Soluble polar  contaminants  \nand degradation products affect the physical and electrical \nproperties of the insulating oil [11], [12], thereby lowering the \nIFT. According to the ASTM D971 standard, a planar ring  of \nplatinum wire with circumference d is immersed in a container \nfilled with water and insulating oil. The force F required to \nmove the ring ten millimetres upwards through the oil -water \ninterface is measured, and the IFT of the oil is then given by \nF/d [12]. The IFT of new insulating oil is expected to be in the \nrange 40-50 mN/m ; an oil sample with an IFT value less than \n25 mN/m is considered to be approaching the end of its useful \nservice lifetime [13].  \nThe IFT measurement technique requires great care. Wrong \nor inconsistent data are likely to be obtained if the precautions \nmentioned in [12] are not carefully and completely observed. \nA trained person is required to make the measurements, u sing \nan expensive piece of equipment, so that in nearly all cases the \noil samples have to be sent to an external laboratory.  \nIn t his article we propose an alternative method of \nmeasuring the IFT of transformer oil , using ultraviolet -to-\nvisible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and artificial intelligence (AI). \nThe UV-Vis spectrum of the oil can be measured very quickly \nonsite, using equipment which is much less cos tly than that \ndescribed in [12], and special training is not required to make \nthe measurements, which can  be automated if required. An \nartificial neural network (ANN) and a fuzzy logic model have \nbeen developed to analyze the UV -Vis spectral data. The IFT \nvalues are compared with those obtained using the ASTM \nD971 standard method. The accuracy of the two AI models is \ntested using another set of oil samples with a wide range of \nIFT values.  \nII. PROPOSED UV-VIS SPECTROSCOPY METHOD \n   Spectroscopic measurements play  an important part in \nvarious power transformer condition monitoring applications \n[6], [14]-[17]. They are also widely used to determine energy \nlevels in  atoms and molecules [18]-[20]. We made IFT \nmeasurements on several samples of transformer oil , using \nUV-Vis spectroscopy in accordance with ASTM E275 [21]. \nOur UV-Vis spectroscopy experimental set up is shown in \nFigure 1.  \n \n \nFigure 1. Experimental setup for UV-Vis spectroscopy \n \nA l ight beam (wavelength λ in the range 200-1100 nm) \ntravels through an optical fiber and enters the oil s ample, \nwhich is placed in a cuvette. The light interacts with the oil, \nand the transmitted light passes through a second optical fiber \nand enters the spectrometer, which is connected to a computer \nwhich displays and analyzes the spectral response of the oi l \nsample. The light absorbance Aλ of the oil sample at \nwavelength λ is related to  the ratio of the light intensity \ntransmitted through the oil sample to the light intensity \nincident on  the sample. According to the Beer-Lambert Law \n[19]  \n.c.lεlog λ10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDR\nDSA\n (1) \nwhere Sλ is the light intensity transmitted through the sample, \nRλ is the light i ntensity incident  on the sample , Dλ is the \nA Novel Method of Measuring Transformer Oil \nInterfacial Tension using UV-Vis Spectroscopy \nNorazhar Abu Bakar1,2 and A. Abu-Siada1 \n1Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Curtin University, Western Australia \n2Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka, Malaysia  \n \n  \n \nR \n \nintensity detected by the spectrometer  with no light incident \non the sample, ελ is the absorbance coefficient of the absorbing \nspecies (or molecule) in the oil , c is the concentra tion of the \nabsorbing species in the oil  (gram/litre), and l is the path \nlength of the light through the oil.  \nIII. EXPERIMENTAL \nIFT measurements were made, following  the ASTM D971 \nring method, on fifty-five mineral oil samples collected from \nin-service transf ormers of various rating s, operating under \nvarious conditions and with various times in service . All \nsamples were Shell Diala BX containing an additive to retard \noil oxidation and delay the formation of acids and sludge [22]. \nAbsorption spectroscopy measuremen ts were then made at \n20ºC on t he s ame samples , using a laboratory grade \nspectrophotometer in accordance with ASTM E275 [21], [23]. \nTo evaluate the impact of the cuvettes containing the oil \nsamples on the measurements, an empty cuvette was scanned \nand its spectrum stored as a reference. Approximately 2.0 ml \nof each oil sample was then placed in a cuvette and scanned. \nThe difference between this spectr um and the reference \nspectrum yields the true oil absorbance characteristic s at \nvarious wavelengths from 200nm to 1100nm. In order to avoid \ncontamination of the oil , all samples were handled and stored \nin accordance with ASTM D923 [24] and measured within 1 \nto 2 days after extraction from the transformer.  Samples of oil \nabsorbance spectra are shown in Figure 2, where the encircled \nnumber is the IFT value of the sample in mN/m. It will be \nseen that, as the IFT value falls, the peak absorbance rises, and \nthe increase in absorbance is maintained acr oss the \"flat top\" \nof each plot.   A new oil sample with an IFT of 40 mN/m \nexhibits the lowest peak absorbance and the narrowest \nbandwidth.  \n \nFigure 2.  UV-Vis absorbance spectra for va rious oil samples. The \nencircled numbers are the corresponding IFT values (in mN/m) [28]. \n \nThe impact of acidity [27] on spectral response was also \nexamined. IFT and acid number are shown in the 3-D plots of \nFigure 3 as functions of peak absorbance and the longest \nwavelength at which absorbance coul d be detected. There is \nno consistent correlation between acid number and either of \nthese two quantities. However, as shown in Figure 3, the peak \nabsorbance and the longest wavelength at which absorbance \ncould be detected increased with decreasing IFT [28]. \n \n \n \nFigure 3.  IFT and acid number as functions of peak absorbance and the \nlongest wavelength at which absorbance could be detected . \nIV. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELS \nAn artificial neural network model and a fuzzy logic model \nhave been developed to investigate the correlation between the \nIFT of an oil sample and its spectral response parameters \n(bandwidth and peak absorbance). \nA. Artificial Neural Network Model \nAn artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning \ntechnique modelled on biological neurons. Its weighted inputs  \ndetermine the activation of the artificial neuron, using a \nmathematical function [29]. The output of the neuron is \ndetermined by another mathematical function, and depends on \ncertain pre-determined threshold limits. Since an ANN is \n\"self-taught\", and has t he ability to deal with complex \nsituations, it has been implemented for various applications, \ne.g., predicting the furan content of transformer oil [30], \ntransformer failure diagnosis [31] and analysis of gases \ndissolved in transformer oil [32]. \nBasic ANN architecture consists of an input layer, a hidden \nlayer, and an output layer. In this work the input layer \nconsisted of two components, namely the bandwidth and peak \nabsorbance of the transformer oil , the hidden layer consisted \nof 20 neurons, and the output was the predicted IFT value.  \n\n \n \nFigure 4. Architecture of the a rtificial neural network model developed in \nthis work.  \n \nThe network was trained using the  Levenberg-Marquardt \nback propagation algorithm  [29], which adopts supervised \nlearning in order to correlate the independent input variables \n(peak absorbance and bandwidth of the absorption spectrum ) \nand the dependent output variable  (IFT value of the oil ). \nRandom weightings of the neurons were carefully adjusted to \nminimize the difference between the measured and estimated \nIFT values . Due to the limited amount of input and output \ndata, a cross validation method was used to validate the ANN \nmodel [33]; it minimises biasing error between the estimated \nand measured IFT values, and enhance s the correlation \ncoefficient between the input and output parameters.  \nThe oil samples were randomly divided into three sets , 39 \nfor training purpose s, 8 for validation of the ANN, and 8 for \ntesting the performance of the ANN. The training set was used \nto determine the weights of the neurons, the validation set was \nused to determine the optimum  number of neurons in the \nhidden layer, and the testing set  was used to evaluate the \noverall performance of the ANN model. \n     \nB. Fuzzy Logic Model \nFuzzy logic is frequently used in mode lling non -linear or \ncomplex systems [34]. It uses variables, usually in the form of \nwords, which are manip ulated using logic rules, such as  “IF-\nTHEN”. Fuzzy logic system architecture consists of five main \nelements, namely fuzzification, membership function , fuzzy \ninference engine, fuzzy rules, and defuzzification, as shown in \nFigure 5. A brief description of these five elements follows: \n   \nMembership function s. There are different types of \nmembership function , such as triangular, trapezoidal and \nGaussian. As an example, if men's height is divided into three \nlevels, above 170cm being Tall , 170-150cm being Normal , \nand less than 150cm being Short, then Height is a fuzzy set  \nand Tall, Normal and Short are the membership function s of \nthat fuzzy set. \nFuzzification is the process of allocating the input data a mong \nthe membership functions.  Thus in the above example a  man \nwith a height of 140cm is allocated to the Short membership \nfunction of the Height fuzzy set.  \nFuzzy Rule s are conditional statements , e.g., “IF-THEN” or \n“IF-AND-THEN”, which associate one or more variables with \neach other. Thus IF(man is short) AND (man is heavy) THEN \n(man is overweight).  \nInference engine converts the fuzzy inputs to the fuzzy outputs \nusing pre-defined fuzzy rules. \nDefuzzification is the process of converting the membership \nfunctions of a fuzzy set to an output with a quantitative value. \nA c ommon defuzzification method is the centre of g ravity \n(COG) method, defined by [34]   \n\n\ndzz\ndzzz\nZ\nz\nz\nCOG\n)(\n)(.\n\n\n  (2) \nwhere ZCOG is the defuzzified output, µz is the membership \nfunction of the output fuzzy set determined from the input data \nand the developed fuzzy rules , and z is the output variable  of \nthe fuzzy system.  \n \nFigure 5.  Basic fuzzy logic system architecture . \nIn this work, the input variables to the fuzzy logic model \nwere the bandwidth (BW) and peak absorbance level (ABS) of \nthe oil sample spectrum, and the output of the model was the \nestimated IFT of the oil sample. The proposed fuzzy logic \nmodel was built using the MATLAB graphical user interface \ntool box. Each input was fuzzified into five Gaussian  \nmembership functions , i.e., low, low -medium, medium, \nmedium-high and high for peak absorbance, and  small, small-\nmedium, medium, medium-high and high for bandwidth,  as \nshown in Figure 6. The IFT output variable was represented \nby the five triangular membership functions very good, good, \nmarginally critical, bad and very bad. Oil samples with IFTs \ngreater than 40mN/m  were considered very good, and oil \nsamples with IFTs less than 17mN/m were considered v ery \nbad.  \nTwenty-five f uzzy logic (IF -AND-THEN) rules were \ndeveloped, based on the known correlation between IFT and \nthe spectral parameters BW  and ABS, as shown in Figure 3. \nThe fuzzy logic rules are illustrated graphic ally in Figure 7; \nthe IFT value can be obtained for any pair of peak absorbance \nand bandwidth values. Samples of these rules are as follows: \n Rule 1: IF (ABS is low) AND (BW is low) THEN (IFT is \nvery good) \n Rule 2: IF (ABS is low) AND (BW is low-medium) THEN \n(IFT is very good) \n Rule 3: IF (ABS is high) AND (BW is high) THEN (IFT is \nvery bad). \n\n \n \nFigure 6. Absorbance, bandwidth and IFT membership functions [35].  \n \n \nFigure 7. Graphical representation of the developed fuzzy logic rules \ncorrelating absorbance and bandwidth with IFT value.  \n \n \nFigure 8.  An example of the calculation of IFT based on Figure 7 and (2).   \n \nThus if ABS = 1.71 and BW = 377nm, then Rule 7 (IF (ABS \nis low-medium) AND (BW is small -medium) THEN (IFT is \ngood)) is execute d, and an estimated IFT of 33 mN/m is \nobtained using COG defuzzification,  as shown in Figure 8. \nV. RESULTS \nFigures 9 and 10 show the estimated IFT as a function of \nABS and BW, according to the ANN and fuzzy logic models \nrespectively.  \n \nFigure 9. IFT as a function of bandwidth and peak absorbance , according \nto the ANN model.  \n \nFigure 10. IFT as a function of bandwidth and peak absorbance, according \nto the fuzzy logic model.  \nVI. ACCURACY ANALYSIS \nFifteen oil samples collected from various transformers \noperating under different conditions were used to examine the \naccuracy of the proposed models. The IFT of each sample was \nmeasured following ASTM D971 . The UV-Vis spectral \nresponse of each sample was also obtained, and BW and ABS \nused as input data to the AI estimation models.  The resulting \nIFT values were then compared with the ASTM D971 values \n(Figure 11).  \n \nFigure 11. Comparison of ASTM D971, fuzzy logic and ANN values of \nIFT for each of fifteen oil samples.  \n\n \nThe percentage difference A between IFT ASTM D971  and \nIFTest (Fuzzy IFT or ANN IFT) is given by:  \n100\n971\n971 \n\n\n\n\n \nASTMD\nestASTMD\nIFT\nIFTIFTA\n (3) \nwhere IFTASTM D971  is the IFT measured using AST M D971  \nand IFTest is the IFT obtained using the ANN or the fuzzy \nlogic model. Averaged over the fifteen samples, A was 3.38% \nfor the ANN model and 3.25% for the fuzzy logic model. The \noverall accurac y, i.e., the ratio of the number of correctly \nestimated IFT values (where A is less than 5%)   to the  total \nnumber of tested samples, was 80% and 87% for the ANN and \nfuzzy logic models respectively.  \nVII. COMPARISON BETWEEN ASTM D971 RING METHOD \nAND UV-VIS SPECTROSCOPY  \nThe proposed UV-Vis spectroscopy method and the \nexisting ASTM D971 method are compared in Table I.  \n \nTable I \nComparison of the ASTM D971 and the proposed UV -Vis methods of \nmeasuring the IFT of oil samples  \n \nMethod ASTM D971 UV-Vis  \nAdvantages \nand \nDisadvantages \nRequires trained person to \nprepare the oil sample and \nmake the measurement. \n \nMust be conducted in a \nlaboratory environment and \nis time consuming. \nNo possibility of on-line \nmonitoring. \nDoes not require a \ntrained person to make \nthe measurement. \n \nCan be conducted on-\nsite. \nCould be implemented \nonline. \nCost Up to US$10,000 (depending \non the model). \nFrom US$3,500 \n(depending on \nspectrophotometer \nfeatures). \nRunning Costs US$120 to US$150 per \nsample. Negligible. \nVIII. CONCLUSION \nWe have described a novel technique for estimating the IFT \nof mineral transformer  oil samples, using UV -Vis \nspectroscopy. It is known that there is a strong correlation \nbetween the IFT of the oil and two of its spectral response \nparameters, namely bandwidth and peak absorbance. We have \ndeveloped t wo artificial intelligence models to ma p this \ncorrelation. Our technique offers the advantages that it can be \nused onsite, it does not need specially trained personnel to \nmake the measurements, it has negligible running costs, and \ncan be readily i mplemented online for continuous monitoring \nof the condition of the oil.   \nIX.
