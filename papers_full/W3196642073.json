Furthermore, the proposed approach can be: (i)\nPlugged to any pre-trained language models; (ii) Extended to widespread classiﬁ-\ncation tasks. A comprehensive evaluation of standard NLP tasks demonstrates that\nthe proposed approach achieves a better few-shot performance1.\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nThe pre-train—ﬁne-tune paradigm has become the de facto standard for natural language processing\n(NLP), and has achieved excellent results in several benchmarks (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019;\nLewis et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2019; Bao et al., 2020a). The success of these pioneers seems to\nsuggest that large-scale pre-trained models are always nothing short of a panacea for boosting machine\nintelligence. However, supervised ﬁne-tuning is still prone to labeled data in practice and faces\nunignorable challenges owing to the variations of domains, language, and tasks. These drawbacks\nlead to the research of an important technique, few-shot learning, which can signiﬁcantly improve the\nlearning capabilities of machine intelligence and practical adaptive applications by accessing only a\nsmall number of labeled examples.\nThe GPT-3 model, introduced by Brown et al. (2020), exhibits impressive few-shot learning capabili-\nties. Given a natural language prompt and 16 labeled samples as demonstrations in the contextual\ninput, GPT-3 achieves 80% of the SOTA results. However, GPT-3 is a fully dense transformer model\nwith 175B parameters, which makes it challenging to deploy in most real-world applications.\nRecently, an emerging ﬁne-tuning methodology has arisen to equip smaller language models (LMs)\nwith few-shot capabilities: adapting the pre-trained LM directly as a predictor through completion\nof a cloze task (Schick & Sch¨utze (2021; 2020); Gao et al. (2020); Liu et al. (2021c)), which treats\nthe downstream task as a (masked) language modeling problem. These prompts can be used in ﬁne-\ntuning to provide the classiﬁer with additional task information, especially in the low-data regime.\n∗Equal contribution and shared co-ﬁrst authorship.\n†Corresponding author.\n1Code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/DART.\n1\narXiv:2108.13161v7  [cs.CL]  4 May 2022\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\n[CLS] The drama [MASK] nothing.

However, determining the appropriate prompts\nrequires domain expertise, and handcrafting a high-performing prompt often requires impractically\nlarge validation sets (Perez et al. (2021)). Recent studies (Lu et al. (2021); Zhao et al. (2021)) have\nreported that the manual prompt format can be sub-optimal, which would result in the accuracy\nvarying from random guess performance to near the state-of-the-art. Therefore, previous approaches\nhave attempted to search for discrete prompt tokens automatically. However, it is non-trivial for\nwidespread classiﬁcation tasks to obtain an optimized prompt template and target label token. For\nexample, speciﬁc classiﬁcation tasks such as relation extraction with the label of alternate name and\ncountry o f birth cannot specify a single label token in the vocabulary.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel DifferentiAble pRompT (DART) ﬁne-tuning approach, which\nis model-agnostic, parameter-efﬁcient. As illustrated in Figure 1, the key idea is to leverage a\nfew parameters (unused tokens) in the language model, which serve as the template and label\ntokens, and to optimize them in the continuous space using backpropagation. Subsequently, we\nintroduce differentiable prompt learning to obtain optimized prompt templates as well as labels. Since\nﬁne-tuning with limited samples can be affected by instability (Dodge et al. (2020); Zhang et al.\n(2021)), we propose an optimization algorithm to jointly learning templates as well as labels. We\nfurther introduce an auxiliary ﬂuency constraint object to ensure the association among the prompt\nembeddings.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on 15 NLP datasets. With only a few training samples across all\nthe tasks, our approach (DART) can obtain a better performance. Notably, absolute performance\nimprovement of up to 23.28%, over the conventional ﬁne-tuning, is obtained on average in the setting\nof K = 8 (and 1.55% for fully supervised settings) on relation extraction datasets with complex label\nsemantics. Our approach can be applied to real-world classiﬁcation tasks without the high cost of\ncollecting and annotating a large amount of data. The main contributions of this study are as follows:\n• We propose a new simple framework for few-shot learning, which is pluggable, extensible,\nand efﬁcient. To the best of our knowledge, optimizing label tokens in continuous space is\nalso a new branch of research that has not been explored in language model prompting.\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\n• A systematic evaluation of 15 NLP tasks shows that the simple-yet-effective method con-\ntributes towards improvements across all these tasks. Remarkably, given only 8 labeled\nsamples per class, our proposed approach can achieve 90% performance of the SOTA results\n(full dataset).\n2 R ELATED WORK\nLanguage Model Prompting. The language model prompting has emerged with the introduction\nof GPT-3 (Brown et al. (2020)), which demonstrates excellent few-shot performance (Liu et al.\n(2021b)). However, GPT-3 is not designed for ﬁne-tuning; it mainly relies on the handcraft prompt\n(in-context learning (Liu et al. (2021a); Zhao et al. (2021); Ding et al. (2021); Min et al. (2021))). Thus,\nrecent studies (Qin & Eisner (2021); Hambardzumyan et al. (2021); Chen et al. (2021)) conducted\nin this ﬁeld have been focused on automatically searching the prompts. Schick & Sch ¨utze (2021;\n2020) propose the PET, which reformulates the NLP tasks as cloze-style questions and performs\ngradient-based ﬁne-tuning. Tam et al. (2021) improve the PET with a denser supervision object\nduring ﬁne-tuning. Shin et al. (2020) propose the AUTOPROMPT to create prompts for a diverse set\nof tasks based on a gradient-guided search. Han et al. (2021) propose an approach called PTR, which\nleverages logic rules to construct prompts with sub-prompts for many-class text classiﬁcation. Wang\net al. (2021) reformulate potential NLP task into an entailment one, and then ﬁne-tune the model with\nfew-shot samples. Hu et al. (2021) propose an approach to incorporate external knowledge graph into\nthe verbalizer with calibration. Additionally, Gao et al. (2020) present LM-BFF—better few-shot\nﬁne-tuning of language models, which leverages T5 (Raffel et al. (2020)) to generate templates and\nsearch label tokens in the vocabulary. However, the utilization of the generative model and the label\nsearch with validation is computation-intensive. Moreover, the prompt search over discrete space is\nsub-optimal due to the continuous nature of neural networks.\nTo overcome these limitations, Liu et al. (2021c) propose P-tuning, which employs trainable continu-\nous prompt embeddings learned by an LSTM. Zhong et al. (2021) propose an effective continuous\nmethod called OPTIPROMPT to optimize prompts for factual probing. Liu et al. (2021c) propose\npreﬁx-tuning, which keeps language model parameters frozen but optimizes a small continuous task-\nspeciﬁc vector for natural language generation tasks. Lester et al. (2021) propose a mechanism for\nlearning “soft prompts” to condition frozen language models to perform downstream tasks. However,\nthese approaches still have to optimize the external parameters (e.g., LSTM in P-tuning) and are\nprone to complex label space.\nConversely, this study aims to develop a novel few-shot learning framework based on pre-trained\nlanguage models which can reduce the prompt engineering (including templates and labels) and\nexternal parameter optimization. Furthermore, the proposed approach only leverages the noninvasive\nmodiﬁcation of the model, which can be plugged into any pre-trained language model and extended\nto the widespread classiﬁcation task.\nFew-shot Learning. Few-shot learning can signiﬁcantly improve the learning capabilities for\nmachine intelligence and practical adaptive applications by accessing only a small number of labeled\nexamples (Zhang et al. (2020)). The proposed approach corresponds to the other few-shot NLP\nmethods, including: (1) Meta-learning (Yu et al. (2018); Bao et al. (2020b); Bansal et al. (2020);\nDeng et al. (2020b;a); Yu et al. (2020)), in which the quantities of the auxiliary tasks are optimized.\n(2) Intermediate training (Phang et al. (2018); Yin et al. (2020)), which supplements the pre-trained\nLMs with further training on the data-rich supervised tasks. (3) Semi-supervised learning (Miyato\net al. (2017); Xie et al. (2020)), which leverages unlabeled samples. The proposed approach focuses\non a more realistic few-shot setting (the number of labeled instances per class can be any variable).\n3 B ACKGROUND\nLet Xin = {x1,x2,..., xL}be a sentence, where xi is the ith token in the input sentence and L is the\nnumber of tokens. Speciﬁcally, Xin is converted to a ﬁxed token sequence ˜Xin and then mapped to\na sequence of hidden vectors {hk ∈Rd}. Given the input sequence, ˜Xin = [CLS]Xin[SEP], the\nconventional ﬁne-tuning approaches leverage a generic head layer over [CLS] embeddings (e.g., an\nMLP layer) to predict an output class. For the prompt-based method, a task-speciﬁc pattern string\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\n(template T ) is designed to coax the model into producing a textual output corresponding to a given\nclass (label token M (Y ))—we refer to these two things together as a prompt. Speciﬁcally, Xprompt\ncontaining one [MASK] token is directly tasked with the MLM input as:\nXprompt = [CLS]Xin [SEP]T [SEP] (1)\nWhen the prompt is fed into the MLM, the model can obtain the probability distribution\np([MASK]|(Xprompt) of the candidate class, y ∈Y as:\np(y|Xprompt) = ∑\nw∈Vy\np([MASK] = w|Xprompt) (2)\nwhere w represents the wth label token of class y.\n4 O UR APPROACH\n4.1 M OTIVATION\nIt can be observed from the previous empirical ﬁndings (Gao et al. (2020); Scao & Rush (2021))\nthat an optimal prompt is necessary for the improvement of the pre-trained language models for\nthe few-shot learners. Since templates with discrete tokens may be sub-optimal and are insufﬁcient\nto represent a speciﬁc class 2, this study proposes DifferentiAble pRompT, referred to as DART,\nwhich can reduce the requirement of prompt engineering in order to improve the applicability of the\nproposed method in various domains.\n4.2 D IFFERENTIABLE TEMPLATE OPTIMIZATION\nSince the language tokens are discrete variables, ﬁnding the optimal prompts with token searching\nis non-trivial and may easily fall into the local minima. To overcome these limitations, we utilize\npseudo tokens to construct templates and then optimize them with backpropagation. Speciﬁcally,\ngiven the template,T = {[T0:i],[MASK],[Ti+1: j]}, which varies from the traditional discrete prompts,\nsatisfying [Ti] ∈V and map T into:\n{w([T0:i]),w([MASK]),w([Ti+1:m])} (3)\nDART considers [Ti] as pseudo tokens and maps the template as follows:\n{h0,..., hi,w([MASK]),hi+1,..., hm} (4)\nwhere hi(0 ≤i ≤j) are trainable parameters. Differentiable template optimization can obtain\nexpressive templates beyond the original vocabularyV . Lastly, the templates, hi, are differentially\noptimized by:\nˆh0:m = argmin\nh\nL(Xprompt,y) (5)\nNote that the values of the prompt embeddings, hi, must be co-dependent with each other rather\nthan independent. Unlike P-tuning (Liu et al. (2021c)), which utilizes a bidirectional LSTM, DART\nleverages an auxiliary ﬂuency constraint objective to associate the prompt embeddings with each\nother, thus stimulating the model to focus on context representation learning.\n4.3 D IFFERENTIABLE LABEL OPTIMIZATION\nPrompt-based ﬁne-tuning requires ﬁlling in one word, and the masked word prediction is mapped\nto a verbalizer, which produces a class (i.e., ”Yes”: True. ”No”: False). For each class c ∈Y , the\n2It is non-trivial to evaluate all options of templates and label tokens.\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\nprevious approaches such as LM-BFF (Gao et al. (2020)) estimate the conditional likelihood of the\ninitial L on a pruned set V c ⊂V of the top k vocabulary words.\nHowever, the brute-forcing label searching: (1) is computationally intensive and tedious because\nthe Ddev is generally very large, requiring multiple rounds of evaluation. (2) has poor scalability\nwith an increase in the class numbers (many classiﬁcation datasets have more than 100 classes), the\nnumber of searches may be kC (C represents the total number of classes), which is exponential and\nthus intractable. Additionally, the labels of classes contain rich, complex semantic knowledge, and\none discrete token may be insufﬁcient to represent this information.\nSpeciﬁcally, with the labels, Y = {Y1,Y2,.., Ym}, different from the previous approach which converts\nthe class type Yi into a variable number of label tokens {...,v1,..,vk,...}, DART maps the Yj to a\ncontinuous vocabulary space as follows:\nM (Yj) ={hm+ j}, (6)\nwhere m is the number of trainable embedding in template. To avoid optimizing any external\nparameters, {h1,..., hm,.., hm+n}is replaced with unused tokens (e.g., [unused1] or special tokens in\nvocabulary) in V to generate V ′, as shown in Figure 1.\n4.4 T RAINING OBJECTIVES\nSince the pseudo tokens in the prompt template must be co-dependent with each other, we introduce\nan auxiliary ﬂuency constraint training without optimizing any other parameters inspired by Liu et al.\n(2021c); Tam et al. (2021). Overall, there are two objectives: the class discrimination objectiveLC\nand the ﬂuency constraint objective LF .\nClass Discrimination Object The class discrimination objective is the main objective that aims to\nclassify the sentences. As shown in Figure 1, given (Xin,T ), we can generate Xprompt as:\nLC = CE(g(y|Xprompt)). (7)\nwhere CE is the cross-entropy loss function, LC represents the class discrimination loss.\nFluency Constraint Object To ensure the association among the template tokens and to maintain\nthe ability of language understanding inherited from the PLMs, we leverage a ﬂuency constraint\nobject with the MLM. As shown in Figure 1, one token in the input sentence is randomly masked,\nand the masked language prediction is conducted. x and x′are the original and masked sequences,\nrespectively. Let xm be the target token that has been masked out in x′, and g(xm|x′,y) is maximized\nas follows3:\nh(xm|x′,y) = exp([[f (x′,y)]]xm )\n∑\nv′∈V ′\nexp([[f (x′,y)]]v′) (8)\nLF = ∑\nm∈M\nBCE(h(xm|x′,y)). (9)\nBy optimizing LF , the language model can obtain a better contextual representation with a rich\nassociation among the template tokens. We have the following training object:\nL = LC +λLF , (10)\nwhere λ is the hyper-parameter. Lastly, we introduce the overall optimization procedure of DART.\nTo mitigate the instability of the few-shot ﬁne-tuning, we jointly optimize templates and labels. Note\nthat our approach can reuse the same transformer architecture (rather than additional LSTM) so that\nit enjoys the beauty of simplicity for prompt-tuning.\n3We use the golden label y rather than the [MASK] in the input of the ﬂuency constraint object.\n5\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\nModel SST-2 (acc) MR(acc) CR(acc) Subj(acc) TREC(acc)\nMajority† 50.9 50.0 50.0 50.0 18.8\nPrompt-based zero-shot‡ 83.6 80.8 79.5 51.4 32.0\n“GPT-3” in-context learning 84.8 (1.3) 80.5 (1.7) 87.4 (0.8) 53.6 (1.0) 26.2 (2.4)\nFine-tuning 81.4 (3.8) 76.9 (5.9) 75.8 (3.2) 90.8 (1.8) 88.8 (2.1)\nLM-BFF 92.3 (1.0) 85.5 (2.8) 89.0 (1.4) 91.2 (1.1) 88.2 (2.0)\nP-Tuning 92.2 (0.4) 86.7 (1.2) 91.8 (1.1) 90.3 (2.2) 86.3 (4.5)\nDART 93.5 (0.5) 88.2 (1.0) 91.8 (0.5) 90.7 (1.4) 87.1(3.8)\nFine-tuning (full)† 95.0 90.8 89.4 97.0 97.4\nModel MNLI (acc) SNLI(acc) QNLI(acc) MRPC(F1) QQP(F1)\nMajority† 32.7 33.8 49.5 81.2 0.0\nPrompt-based zero-shot‡ 50.8 49.5 50.8 61.9 49.7\n“GPT-3” in-context learning 52.0 (0.7) 47.1 (0.6) 53.8 (0.4) 45.7 (6.0) 36.1 (5.2)\nFine-tuning 45.8 (6.4) 48.4 (4.8) 60.2 (6.5) 76.6 (2.5) 60.7 (4.3)\nLM-BFF 68.3 (2.5) 77.1 (2.1) 68.3 (7.4) 76.2 (2.3) 67.0 (3.0)\nP-Tuning 61.5 (2.1) 72.3 (3.0) 64.3 (2.8) 74.5 (7.6) 65.6 (3.0)\nDART 67.5 (2.6) 75.8 (1.6) 66.7 (3.7) 78.3 (4.5) 67.8 (3.2)\nFine-tuning (full)† 89.8 92.6 93.3 91.4 81.7\nTable 1: Our main results with RoBERTa-large. †: the full training set is used. ‡: no training\nexamples are used.

We\nutilize a grid search over multiple hyperparameters and select the best result as measured on Ddev for\neach set {Ds\ntrain,Ddev},s ∈Sseed. We employ AdamW as the optimizer. We conduct experiments with\na RoBERTa-large (Liu et al. (2019)) on classiﬁcation tasks for a fair comparison with LM-BFF. We\nleverage an uncased BERT-large (Devlin et al. (2019)) for relation extraction datasets, except that we\nuse SCIBERT (Beltagy et al. (2019)) for the ChemProt dataset. We follow Soares et al. (2019) and\nuse special entity markers uniformly to highlight the entity mentions for relation extraction.\n4https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE/\n5https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T06\n6\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\nDataset Model K = 8 K = 16 K = 32 Full\nSemEval\nFine-tuning 26.3 43.8 64.2 87.8\nLM-BFF 43.2 62.0 72.9 88.0\nDART 51.8 (+25.5) 67.2 (+23.4) 77.3 (+13.1) 89.1 (+1.3)\nTACRED-Revisit\nFine-tuning 7.4 15.5 25.8 75.0\nLM-BFF 21.0 23.7 27.1 76.4\nDART 25.8 (+18.4) 30.1 (+14.6) 31.8 (+6.0) 77.8 (+2.8)\nWiKi80\nFine-tuning 46.3 60.3 70.0 87.5\nLM-BFF 66.5 73.5 78.1 86.2\nDART 68.5 (+22.2) 75.2 (+14.9) 79.4 (+9.4) 88.1 (+0.6)\nChemProt\nFine-tuning 30.2 41.5 52.5 79.5\nLM-BFF 55.0 56.1 60.0 79.1\nDART 57.2 (+27.0) 60.8 (+19.3) 63.1 (+10.6) 81.0 (+1.5)\nTable 2: Results on RE dataset WiKi80 (accuracy), while other datasets (micro F 1).

(FT= Fine tuning)\n5.3 M AIN RESULTS\nAs shown in Table 1, we observe that our approach obtains better performance than conventional\nﬁne-tuning and achieves comparable results with LM-BFF. Note that DART can reduce the prompt\nengineering without external models (e.g., T5 in LM-BFF) to generate templates that are readily\neasy to adapt to other datasets. DART can obtain 11.3% improvement with only 16 training samples\nper class on the MR dataset, comparable with LM-BFF, which leverages T5 to generate appropriate\nprompts. These results indicate that DART can better stimulate potential ability and makes the pre-\ntrained language model a better few-shot learner. We also notice that DART yields better performance\nthan P-tuning, which indicates that label optimization is beneﬁcial.\nFor the classiﬁcation tasks with the complex label space, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 2(a), we\nobserve that DART outperforms the conventional ﬁne-tuning approach as well as LM-BFF with\na large margin on relation extraction and event extraction datasets in both the few-shot and fully\nsupervised settings. The proposed approach achieves an improvement of 2.8% of the absolute\nperformance on the TACRED-Revisit dataset with full supervision and yields 18.4% gains with only\n8 training samples per class. These ﬁndings also indicate that more relevant templates and labels can\nbe determined without expert intervention, making it possible to generalize the proposed approach to\nother domains. We attribute the signiﬁcant improvements to the fact that, unlike the GLUE datasets\ncontaining small categories, in relation extraction and event extraction tasks, the datasets consist of a\nlarge number of classes with complex label space, making it more challenging to obtain suitable label\ntokens. Furthermore, we notice that the improvement decays slowly when K becomes larger (i.e.,\nfrom 8 to 32). Our approach is a simple yet effective ﬁne-tuning paradigm that can reduce prompt\nengineering within the complex label space, thus, making it possible to be an appropriate plug-in for\nsome SOTA models.\n5.4 A BLATION STUDY\nWe conduct an ablation study to validate the effectiveness of the components in the proposed approach.\nWe observe that DART exhibits a performance decay in the absence of any one of the modules, i.e.,\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\n4 8 16 32 full\nK\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70Micro F1 (%)\nDART\nLM-BFF\nBERT\n(a) Event extraction results on ACE-2005.\n8 16 32 full\nK\n40\n60\n80Micro F1 (%)\nDART(BERT)\nDART(GPT-2-medium)\nFT(GPT-2-medium)\nFT(BERT) (b) BERT-large & GPT-2-medium results on Se-\nmEval.\nFigure 2: (a) Few-shot results using the ACE-2005.

Furthermore, we notice that differentiable label optimization is more\nsensitive to performance and is highly beneﬁcial for DART, especially for low-resource settings.\nSince the proposed approach is the ﬁrst approach that utilizes the differentiable label optimization,\nthese ﬁndings illustrate that a suitable label token is important.\n5.5 A NALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\nCAN DART B E APPLIED TO OTHER PRE-TRAINED LMS?\nTo evaluate whether the proposed approach can be applied to other LMs, we conduct experiments\nusing GPT-2-medium6 . From Figure 2(b), we observe that DART with GPT-2-medium yields better\nperformance than the conventional ﬁne-tuning approach. Furthermore, we notice that DART with\nGPT-2-medium can achieve performance on par with BERT-large, as observed by Liu et al. (2021c),\nindicating that the potential of GPT-style architectures for natural language understanding has been\nunderestimated.\nWHY DO DIFFERENTIABLE PROMPTS YIELD BETTER PERFORMANCE ?\nTo further analyze why our differentiable prompts method yields better performance compared with\nprompts with ﬁxed templates and label tokens, we visualize the representation of masked tokens in\nthe CR dataset during different training steps (from left to right) as shown in Figure 3 (ﬁxed) and\n4 (differentiable), respectively. While both methods learn separable hidden states, differentiable\nprompts’ representation is relatively more compact while the representation generated from ﬁxed\nprompts is more scattered. This observation of differentiable prompts generating more discriminative\nrepresentations than the ﬁxed prompts method is supported by an indicator RD, the ratio between\naverage intra-class and average inter-class distance. We believe the main reason behind its better\nperformance lies in the more discriminative representation of the differentiable method. More details\ncan be found in Appendix A.6.\nWHAT EXACTLY IS OPTIMIZED PROMPT ?\nSince prompt templates and label tokens in the proposed approach are mapped as{h1,..., hm,.., hm+n},\nwe further analyze what exactly optimized label learned. We conduct a nearest-neighbor vocabulary\nembedding search to project the Top-3 optimized pseudo-label tokens in V to a readable natural\n6We do not utilize the ﬂuency constraint object in GPT-2-medium since the model is not pre-trained with\nMLM objective.\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\n50\n 0 50\n60\n40\n20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n50\n 0 50\n100\n75\n50\n25\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n50\n 0 50\n100\n75\n50\n25\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n50\n 0 50\n100\n75\n50\n25\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nFigure 3: Visualization of masked tokens’ representation in different training steps (with training 10,\n30, 50, 70 steps from left to right) with ﬁxed prompts.\n40\n 20\n 0 20\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n50\n 0 50 100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n50\n 0 50 100\n60\n40\n20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n50\n 0 50 100\n60\n40\n20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nFigure 4: Visualization of masked tokens’ representation in different training steps (with training 10,\n30, 50, 70 steps from left to right) with differentiable prompts.\nlanguage.We use t-SNE (Van der Maaten & Hinton (2008)) with normalization to visualize labels on\nWiki80 dataset. For example, “military branch” refers to as red ⋆ in Figure 5 represents the relation\ntype, which is learned by optimizing the pseudo label in the continuous space, and the “volunteered ”,\n“corporal ” and “buddies”, refers to as •are the tokens closest to the label. This ﬁnding indicates that\nthe differentiable method generates better semantic representation.\nDART V.S. C ONVENTIONAL FINE -TUNING\nFigure 5: A 3D visualization of several\nlabel representations learned in DART.\nThe ability of DART to perform few-shot learning can be\nattributed to the label and being a true language under-\nstanding task, that once the model is capable of perform-\ning it correctly, it can easily apply this knowledge to other\ntasks that are framed as such. Superﬁcially, (i) DART does\nnot optimize any new parameters; however, conventional\nﬁne-tuning should learn an explicit classiﬁer head over\n[CLS] embeddings, which may fail in the low-data regime.\n(ii) DART has the same task setting as large-scale language\nmodel pre-training.\n6 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nThis paper presents DART, a simple yet effective ﬁne-\ntuning approach that improves the fast-shot learning pre-\ntrained language model. The proposed approach can pro-\nduce satisfactory improvements in the few-shot scenarios when compared to the conventional ﬁne-\ntuning approaches. The proposed method is also pluggable for other language models (e.g., BART)\nand can be extended to other tasks, such as intent detection and sentiment analysis. Intuitively, the\nresults obtained in this study can be used to stimulate future research directions in the few-shot or\nlifelong learning for NLP.\n9\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe want to express gratitude to the anonymous reviewers for their hard work and kind comments.\nThis work is funded by National Key R&D Program of China (Funding No.SQ2018YFC000004),\nNSFCU19B2027/NSFC91846204, Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (No.\nLGG22F030011), Ningbo Natural Science Foundation (2021J190), and Yongjiang Talent Introduction\nProgramme (2021A-156-G).\nREPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT\nOur code is available in https://github.com/zjunlp/DART for reproducibility.

In North American Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL), 2021.\nA A PPENDIX\nOur code is available in the supplementary materials for reproducibility. This section contains details\nabout the training procedures and hyperparameters for each of the datasets. We utilize Pytorch (Paszke\net al., 2019) to conduct experiments with 1 Nvidia 3090 GPUs. All optimizations are performed with\nthe AdamW optimizer with a linear warmup of learning rate over the ﬁrst 10% of gradient updates\nto a maximum value, then linear decay over the remainder of the training. Gradients are clipped if\ntheir norm exceeds 1.0, and weight decay on all non-bias parameters is set to 0.01. Early stopping is\nadopted to reduce over-ﬁtting on the training set.\nWe follow LM-BFF (Gao et al., 2020) to measure the average performance of models trained on 5\ndifferent randomly sampledDtrain and Ddev splits, and perform grid search for optimal hyper-parameter\ncombinations on each split, including learning-rate, weight decay, and batch size.\nFor P-tuning (Liu et al., 2021c), due to the limit of search space, we do not set anchor tokens in\nprompt tokens.\nFor DART, we adopt joint optimization to acquire optimal prompts and ﬁne-tune over global parame-\nters. Note that we use base prompts as templates of pseudo tokens to accelerate convergence.\n14\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\nTo compare fairly, we use RoBERTa-large (Liu et al., 2019) as pre-trained model for both DART and\nP-tuning framework, following LM-BFF (Gao et al., 2020). We also adopt the best discrete prompts\ntogether with label words in LM-BFF as base prompt settings for each framework, as stated below.\nA.1 H YPER -PARAMETER SEARCH SPACE OF OUR METHOD IN GRID SEARCH\nSST-2, MR, CR, Subj, TREC, QNLI, MRPC, QQP\nThe hyper-parameter search space is (the optimal set of parameters may vary across different tasks\nand data splits):\n• learning rate [1e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4, 2e-4]\n• weight decay [0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.10]\n• number epochs [20,30]\n• batch size: [4, 8, 16, 24, 32]\n• max seq length: 128\n• gradient accumulation steps: [ 1, 2]\nMNLI, SNLI\nThe hyper-parameter search space is (the optimal set of parameters may vary across different tasks\nand data splits):\n• learning rate [1e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4, 2e-4]\n• weight decay [0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.10]\n• number epochs [30,40]\n• batch size: [4, 8, 16]\n• max seq length: 256\n• gradient accumulation steps: [1, 2]\nTACRED-Revisit, WiKi80, SemEval\nThe hyper-parameter search space are:\n• learning rate [3e-5,5e-5,1e-5,5e-6]\n• number epochs [20,30]\n• batch size: 48\n• max seq length: 128\n• gradient accumulation steps: 2\nChemProt\nThe hyper-parameter search space are:\n• learning rate [3e-5,5e-5,1e-5,5e-6]\n• number epochs [20,30]\n• batch size: 48\n• max seq length: 256\n• gradient accumulation steps: 4\nDialogRE\nThe hyper-parameter search space is (the optimal set of parameters may vary across different tasks\nand data splits):\n• learning rate [1e-5, 5e-5, 1e-4, 2e-4]\n15\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\n• weight decay [0.0, 0.10]\n• number epochs [20,30,40]\n• batch size: [4, 8]\n• max seq length: 256\n• gradient accumulation steps: [1, 2]\nA.2 B ASE PROMPT AND LABEL WORDS\nSST-2, MR, CR\n• prompt template(length = 3) [”text”, ”it”, ”was”, ”<mask>”, ”.”]\n• label words {”0”: ”terrible”, ”1”: ”great”}\nSubj\n• prompt template(length = 3) [”text”, ”This”, ”is”, ”<mask>”, ”.”]\n• label words {”0”: ”incorrect”, ”1”: ”correct”}\nTREC\n• prompt template(length = 1) [”<mask>”, ”:”, ”text”]\n• label words {”0”: ”Description”, ”1”:”Entity”,”2: ”Expression”,”3”: ”Human”,”4”: ”Loca-\ntion”,”5”:”Number”}\nMNLI, SNLI\n• prompt template(length = 2) [”texta”, ”?”, ”<mask>”, ”,”, ”textb”]\n• label words {”contradiction”: ”No”,”entailment”: ”Yes”, ”neutral”: ”Maybe”}\nQNLI\n• prompt template(length = 2) [”texta”, ”?”, ”<mask>”, ”,”, ”textb”]\n• label words {”not entailment”: ”No”,”entailment”: ”Yes”}\nMRPC, QQP\n• prompt template(length = 2) [”texta”, ”?”, ”<mask>”, ”,”, ”textb”]\n• label words {”0”: ”No”, ”1”: ”Yes”}\nTACRED-Revisit, WiKi80, SemEval,DialogRE\n• prompt template(length = 3) [”text”, Entity1, ”is”, ”the”, ”<mask>”, ”of”, Entity2]\n• label words {”country of origin”, ”participating team”, ”participant of”,...}\nA.3 T EMPLATE LENGTH ANALYSIS\nModel Accuracy\nDART (length = 2) 92.6 (0.6)\nDART(length = 3) 93.5 (0.5)\nDART (length = 5) 91.2 (1.1)\nDART (length = 10) 90.6 (0.5)\nFine-tuning 81.4 (3.8)\nTable 4: Few-shot performance on SST-2 task using templates with different length.\n16\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\nWe deﬁne the length of a template as the number of tokens except for input sentence and <mask>\ntoken, and apply DART on templates with different length. The performance of a speciﬁc template\nlength l is derived by summarizing the averaging accuracy on each few-shot data splits, using template\nT = t1,t2,..., tl. From the Table 4, we observe that for the SST-2 task, the model whose template\nlength is three yield best performance; however, the overall impact of template length is rather\ninsigniﬁcant as models with different template length obtain relatively similar performance.\nA.4 P ERFORMANCE ON FULL TRAINING SET\nModel SST-2 (acc) MR (acc) CR (acc) Subj (acc) TREC (acc)\nFine-tuning 95.0 90.8 89.4 97.0 97.4\nLM-BFF 94.9 91.9 92.4 96.9 97.3\nDART 94.6 91.3 93.8 96.6 95.6\nModel MNLI (acc) SNLI (acc) QNLI (acc) MRPC (F1) QQP (F1)\nFine-tuning 89.8 92.6 93.3 91.4 81.7\nLM-BFF 89.6 90.3 92.8 91.7 86.4\nDART 87.3 89.5 92.3 90.4 89.5\nTable 5: Full training set results with RoBERTa-large. Fine-tuning: we reported same results as Gao\net al. (2020). LM-BFF: we trained LM-BFF model (without demonstration) on full-training set.\nWe conduct experiments and report the performance of DART with full-sized training data of GLUE\ntasks. From Table 5, we notice that DART obtain better or comparable results compared with the\nstandard ﬁne-tuning and LM-BFF, indicating that prompt-based tuning methods beneﬁt less from\nfull-sized data.\nA.5 P ERFORMANCE WITH CONSTRAINED LABEL TOKENS\nWe conduct a nearest neighbor vocabulary embedding search to project the best optimized differen-\ntialble label token to a readable natural token. Those tokens are chosen based on cosine-similarity\nbetween all tokens’ embedding and the optimized differentialble label token of DART. We list them\nin descending order with similarity scores (i.e., the token ‘great‘ is chosen as its cosine-similarity\nscore with trained positive label embedding of DART is the highest among all tokens, and the token\n‘terrible‘ is the most similar token with the trained negative label embedding; the other tokens are\nselected and listed in descending order with similarity scores). From Table 6, we observe that the\nperformance of ﬁxed prompt models is related to the similarity score of the chosen label token and that\nthe DART model learns more semantic representation for label tokens, thus, yield best performance.\nLabel tokens Accuracy\ndifferentiable token (DART) 91.8 (0.5)\ngreat/terrible 91.5 (0.3)\nfantastic/awful 91.0 (0.6)\namazing/horrible 90.2 (0.8)\ngood/bad 89.6 (0.5)\nTable 6: Few-shot performance on CR task using constrained label tokens with DART.\n17\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nTraining steps\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8Intra-class distance / inter-class distance\nFixed\nDifferentiable\nFigure 6: The RD ratio curve on dev set of CR task of ﬁxed prompt and differentiable prompt during\ntraining.\nA.6 M ORE EXPERIMENTS\nWe numeralize our observation on representation of masked token with a ratio between the average\nintra-class distance and average inter-class distance of hidden state vectors as RD =\n¯Dintra\n¯Dinter\n, where:\n¯Dintra = 1\nC\nC\n∑\nc=1\n¯Dintra(c) = 1\nC\nC\n∑\nc=1\n1\nNc\nNc\n∑\ni=1\nNc\n∑\nj=1\ndistance(Hc[i],Hc[ j]);\n¯Dinter = 1\nC(C −1)\nC\n∑\nc1=1\n∑\nc2̸=c1\n¯Dinter(c1,c2) = 1\nC(C −1)\nC\n∑\nc1=1\n∑\nc2̸=c1\nNc1\n∑\ni=1\nNc2\n∑\nj=1\ndistance(Hc1 [i],Hc2 [ j]);\n(11)\nwhere distance is the euclidean metric between two vectors, and Hc[i] means the hidden state\nrepresentation of masked token of i-th sample from class c. For discriminative representation, its\naverage intra-class distance is low as data points within the same class tend to gather together, and its\naverage inter-class distance is high as data points from different classes are separated, so its RD ratio\nshould be close to 0.\nAs is shown in Figure 6, the RD ratio of the differentiable method grows lower than that of the ﬁxed\nlabel method, which shows the hidden state representation trained in the differentiable method has\nbetter linear separability.\nNote that in a masked language model, a linear transformation is performed on the hidden state\nrepresentations, with a linear decoder sharing weights with the model’s word embeddings serving\nas the ﬁnal token classiﬁer. Hence it is evident that better linear separability of the representations\nleads to better performance. In our case, the differentiable method yields better performance due to\nits better linear separability.\nA.7 L IMITATIONS\nOur work may fail when the distribution of the task corpus varies from that of the pre-training corpus.\nFor example, a general pre-trained language model may be ﬁne-tuned with more training instances\nin a speciﬁc domain (e.g., medical domain). This issue can be addressed by intermediate training\n(Phang et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021), and will be analyzed in the future work.\nBesides, our work also shows an instability associated with hyper-parameters which is also observed\nby Dodge et al. (2020); Zhang et al. (2021); Perez et al. (2021) as volatility of few-shot learning\n18\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2022\nin NLP. Overall, however, we believe our work will inspire future work to few-shot settings with\nmore practical applications to low-data settings, e.g., that involve low-resource languages or expert\nannotation.\nA.8 B ROADER IMPACT\nThe pre-train-ﬁne-tune approach has become the standard for natural language processing (NLP).\nHowever, supervised ﬁne-tuning is still practically affected by labeled data. This study proposes a\nnovel pluggable, extensible, and efﬁcient approach named DifferntiAble pRompT (DART), which\ncan convert small language models into better few-shot learners. We believe that our study makes\na signiﬁcant contribution to the literature because determining the appropriate prompts requires\ndomain expertise, and handcrafting a high-performing prompt often requires impractically large\nvalidation sets, and these issues have been overcome with the use of the proposed method, which\nis model-agnostic, parameter-efﬁcient. We experimentally veriﬁed our proposed approach on 13\nstandard NLP tasks, and it was seen to outperform several standard NLP platforms.\n19",
