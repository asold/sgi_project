To further improve the PA efﬁciency\nat deep PBO, the multi-way combined Doherty PA with\nswitched transformer [18], Class-G Doherty [19]–[21], sub-\nharmonic switching (SHS) [22]–[24], and hybrid Doherty\nwith impedance boosting [25] are developed. The multi-way\ncombined PA with switched transformer introduces various\nefﬁciency peaks due to the load modulation [18], which suffers\nfrom relatively large circuit size and limited passive efﬁciency.\nClass-G Doherty PAs [19]–[21] show competitive efﬁciency\nat deep PBOs. However, supply switching is needed, which\nwould lead to linearity degradation due to mode switch-\ning [19]. To mitigate the degradation from supply switching,\nthe Class-G voltage-mode Doherty is proposed with extra\nhardware overhead [20], [21]. The SHS PAs [22]–[24] can\nenhance the PA efﬁciency at deep PBO by using subharmonic\ncomponent of carrier frequency, which sacriﬁces the circuit\nsize due to multiple power combined ways. The technique of\nhybrid Doherty and impedance boosting [25] increases the PA\nefﬁciency at deep PBO with less power-combining ways and\ndc power supplies. However, the degraded passive efﬁciency\nlimits the PA efﬁciency at deep PBO.\nThe polar TXs [26], [27] are proposed with high peak\nefﬁciency. However, the polar TXs require a complex coor-\ndinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) and phase modu-\nlator (PM). Besides, the phase control and amplitude control\nshould be synchronized, which could affect bit error rate\nand error vector magnitude (EVM) performance. Compared\nto polar TXs, quadrature TXs [28]–[35] show advantages of\nsimpler architecture and higher data rate. Meanwhile, the tech-\nnique of I/Q cell sharing can increase the peak efﬁciency\nof quadrature TX [31]. Recently, the quadrature PAs with\nPBO efﬁciency enhancement are reported with competitive\nperformances [25], [30]–[35]. However, it is still challenging\nto increase the efﬁciency at deep PBOs for quadrature PAs.\nIn this article, a watt-level quadrature switched/ﬂoated\ncapacitor power ampliﬁer ( SFCPA) with reconﬁgurable\nself-coupling canceling transformer (RSCCT) for deep PBO\nefﬁciency enhancement is presented [36].

Switched/Floated Capacitor Power Ampliﬁer\nThe conventional SCPA with good AM–AM linearity is\nshown in Fig. 1(a). The total number of unit capacitor is\nN. The capacitance of Ci (i = 1,..., N)i s C.T h en unit\ncapacitors are switched by square waveform. The other unit\ncells are switched OFF and connected to the ground. The\ndynamic power PSC required to charge and discharge the\ncapacitor array leads to efﬁciency degradation at PBO [37].\nTo solve this problem, the SFCPA is proposed in this article.\nThe schematic of the SFCPA isshown in Fig. 1(b). The capac-\nitance ofCi (i = 1,..., N)i sC. Similar to SCPA, the bottom\nplates of switched-ON capacitors are switched between VDD\nand GND. However, the bottom plates of unused capacitors are\nﬂoated and not connected to GND. Then, the dynamic power\nconsumption PSFC, which is needed to charge and discharge\nthe capacitor array, is decreased. Therefore, the PBO efﬁciency\nof SFCPA could be enhanced compared to conventional SCPA.\nThe schematic and equivalent circuit of SFCPA are shown\nin Fig. 2. The source resistance of each unit cell (i.e., ON-\nresistance of switch) is set to beRs . The total equivalent source\nresistance is Rs /n,w h e r en is the number of switched-ON\nunit cells. The inductor Ldm is used to achieve the output\nimpedance matching. Then, the output power of the proposed\nSFCPA can be calculated by the following equation:\nP\nout,SFC = 2VDD2\nπ2 × Ropt,SFC\n(Ropt,SFC + Rs /n)2 (1)\nFig. 2. Schematic and its equivalent circuit of SFCPA.\nwhere Ldm = 1/(4π2 f 2 ×nC ) is used for non-reﬂective output\nmatching and f is the operation frequency. The dynamic\npower consumption PSFC required to charge and discharge\ncapacitor array can be expressed as\nPSFC = Cin × VDD2 × f (2)\nwhere Cin is the input capacitance driven through the selected\nswitches [37]. Once the unused unit capacitor is ﬂoated,Cin\ncould be regarded as 0, which makesPSFC = 0. The power\ndissipation on the source resistor is\nPRs,SFC = 2VDD2\nπ2 × Rs /n\n(Ropt,SFC + Rs /n)2 . (3)\nThen, the drain efﬁciency (DE) of the proposed SFCPA can\nbe calculated as\nDESFC = Pout,SFC\nPout,SFC + PSFC + PRs,SFC\n=\nRopt,SFC\nRs /n\nRopt,SFC\nRs /n + 1\n(n = 1,..., N). (4)\nWhen the following relationship is deﬁned:\nt = Ropt,SFC\nRs /n . (5)\nEquation (4) can be further expressed as\nDESFC = t\nt + 1. (6)\nIt can be seen that the DE of SFCPA is only related to\nthe coefﬁcient t. To obtain the maximal DE in the whole\nPBO range, the coefﬁcient t should maintain constant. Also,\nt should be much larger than 1 for higher DE of SFCPA.\nThe typical DE of conventional SCPA and proposed SFCPA\nis calculated and compared in Fig. 3. The detailed derivation\nto obtain the DE of SCPA is shown in the Appendix. t is\n5 for both SFCPA and SCPA in the calculation. As shown\nin Fig. 3, the proposed SFCPA shows the same peak DE with\nSCPA at 0-dB PBO. The proposed SFCPA maintains maximal\nDE in the whole PBO range. In contrast, the DE of SCPA\nis signiﬁcantly decreased at PBO due to the dynamic power\nP\nSC. Moreover, the DE of SCPA is limited by ﬁniteQloaded\nof on-chip matching network. Typically,Qloaded is limited to\n2–3 for fully integrated CMOS implementation [37].\nHowever, in practical implementation, the ﬂoated unit cell of\nSFCPA introduces the parasitic capacitor, which would lead to\nefﬁciency degradation. The diagram of SFCPA considering the\nparasitic capacitor of ﬂoated unit cell is shown in Fig. 4. The\ncapacitance of unit capacitor isC. The parasitic capacitance of\nY ANGet al.: QUADRATURE SFCPA WITH RSCCT FOR DEEP BACK-OFF EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT 3717\nFig. 3. Calculated typical DE of th e proposed SFCPA and conventional\nSCPA with various loaded quality factors (t = 5).\neach ﬂoated unit cell isCpar. The ratio ofCpar to C is assumed\nto be r. Then, the following equation can be obtained:\nr = Cpar\nC . (7)\nThe number of switched- ON unit capacitor is n (n =\n1,..., N). Also, N − n unit capacitors are ﬂoated, which\nintroduces the total parasitic capacitance of (N −n)Cpar. Then,\nthe output power can be calculated as\nP′\nout,SFC = 2n2VDD2\nπ2[n + (N − n)r]2 × Ropt,SFC\n(Ropt,SFC + Rs /n)2 . (8)\nThe dynamic power PSFC needed to charge and discharge\nthe capacitor array is computed as\nP′\nSFC = n(N − n)r\n[n + (N − n)r]2 × 2VDD2\nπ Ropt,SFC Qloaded\n. (9)\nThe power dissipation on the source resistor is\nP′\nRs ,SFC = 2n2VDD2\nπ2[n + (N − n)r]2 × Rs /n\n(Ropt,SFC + Rs /n)2 . (10)\nThen, the DE of the SFCPA considering parasitic capacitor\ncan be expressed as\nDE′\nSFC =\n4nR ′2\nopt,SFC\n4nR ′2\nopt,SFC + A + 4nR ′\nopt,SFC Rs /n\n=\n4n\n( R′\nopt,SFC\nRs /n\n)2\n4n\n( R′\nopt,SFC\nRs /n\n)2\n+ B + 4n\nR′\nopt,SFC\nRs /n\n= 4nt 2\n4nt 2 + πr(N−n)(t+1)2\nQloaded\n+ 4nt\n(11)\nwhere\nA =\nπr(N − n)\n(\nR′\nopt,SFC + Rs /n\n)2\nQloaded\n(12)\nB =\nπr(N − n)\n( R′\nopt,SFC\nRs /n + 1\n)2\nQloaded\n(13)\nt =\nR′\nopt,SFC\nRs /n . (14)\nQloaded is the loaded quality factor of the network. The\ntypical DE of SFCPA considering Cpar is calculated with\nQloaded = 6a n dt = 5, as shown in Fig. 5. Various values\nFig. 4. Schematic of SFCPA considering the parasitic capacitor Cpar of\nﬂoated unit cell.\nFig. 5. Calculated DE of SCPA and SFCPA at PBO (Qloaded = 6a n dt = 5).\nof r are concluded. In practical circuits,r is usually less than\n0.4. It is notable that the parasitic capacitor Cpar of ﬂoated\nunit cell leads to the efﬁciency degradation of SFCPA at\nPBO. Therefore, Cpar should be limited in circuit design for\nhigher PBO efﬁciency. Besides, the typical DE of SCPA with\nQloaded = 6a n dt = 5 is calculated and shown in Fig. 5, which\nis still lower than the DE of SFCPA withr = 0.4.\nB. Deep PBO Efﬁciency Enhancement Based on SFCPA\nBased on the SFCPA, the proposed quadrature DPA with\nhybrid Doherty and impedance boosting is proposed for efﬁ-\nciency enhancement at deep PBO. The corresponding opera-\ntion is shown in Fig. 6. Two operation modes (modes I and II)\na n de i g h tt y p i c a ls t a t e s( A ,B ,C ,D ,E ,F ,G ,a n dH )a r e\nadopted. Two conditions (i.e., states A, B, C, and D with\nI input code = Q input code and states E, F, G, and H\nwith I input code or Q input code = 0) are discussed. The\ncapacitance of each unit capacitor isC. Also, the total number\nof unit cells isN for main and auxiliary PAs. The RSCCT is\nused to convert different load impedances of PA to output\nload. The corresponding trajectories of load impedances for\nmain and auxiliary PAs are compared in Fig. 7. The DE at\nPBO is shown in Fig. 8. The condition ofI = Q means that\nthe combined I/Q vectors show the same magnitude, which\ndelivers output voltage at the phases of 45\n◦, 135◦, 225◦,a n d\n315◦ in the complex domain. The condition of I or Q = 0\nmeans that the I orQ vector is disabled, which delivers output\nvoltage only at the phases of 0◦,9 0◦, 180◦, and 270◦ in the\ncomplex domain. Then, the proposed SFCPA could introduce\nsix efﬁciency peaks at 0-/3-/6-/9-/12-/15-dB PBOs.\nThe detailed operation is clearly explained as follows. From\n0- to 6-dB PBO range with I = Q, the proposed SFCPA\noperates in mode I. No unit cell is ﬂoated in mode I. At state\nA, the load impedances for main and auxiliary PAs are\nR\nopt. All unit cells of main and auxiliary PAs are switched\nON to deliver the maximal Pout. The equivalent total source\n3718 IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, VOL. 56, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2021\nFig. 6. Operation of the proposed SFCPA with hybrid Doherty and impedance boosting.\nimpedance is Rs /N. From state A to B, the auxiliary PA is\nturned off gradually. The switched-OFF unit cells are connected\nto GND. It leads to good AM–AM distortion due to the similar\noperation with SCPA. Thus, the output voltage is nearly linear\nwith amplitude control code. The load impedance Z\nLM of\nmain PA is increased to 2Ropt due to the Doherty operation at\nstate B, which introduces the efﬁciency enhancement at 6-dB\nPBO. Meanwhile, the load impedanceZLA of auxiliary PA is\ndecreased to 0. From 6-dB to lower PBO level, the proposed\nSFCPA operates in mode II. The number of switched-ON unit\ncells is n, which is not changed during mode II. At state C,\nboth main and auxiliary PAs are partiallyON.T h en unit cells\nare ﬂoated. Also, the equivalent total source impedance is\nRs /n.A n N − n number of unused capacitors are ﬂoated\nto decrease PSFC with enhanced efﬁciency at 6-dB PBO.\nMeanwhile, the passive load impedances of main and auxiliary\nPAs are reconﬁgured to beR′\nopt by the RSCCT. The ratio of\nR′\nopt to Ropt is deﬁned as\nm =\nR′\nopt\nRopt\n. (15)\nThen, R′\nopt is equal to mR opt. The output current for main\nand auxiliary PAs are(2/m)1/2 Imax at state C. With increased\nload impedance of R′\nopt = mR opt, the impedance turn ration2\nof the matching network in mode II is decreased compared\nto the turn ratio n1 in mode I. In addition, as discussed in\nSection II-A, the coefﬁcientt is required to be unchanged for\nstates A and C. At state A,t can be calculated as\nt = Ropt\nRs /N . (16)\nAt state C,t can be computed as\nt =\nR′\nopt\nRs /n = mR opt\nRs /n . (17)\nThen, the following relationship can be derived based on\n(16) and (17).\nm = N\nn . (18)\nTo avoid the amplitude discontinuity at mode\nswitching, the output power of states B and C\nFig. 7. Trajectories of load impedances for main and auxillary PAs.\nshould be the same. Then, the following equations\ncan be obtained:\nP\nout,B = 4VDD2 Ropt\nπ2(2Ropt + Rs /N)2 = 4VDD2t\nπ2(2t + 1)2 Rs /N. (19)\nPout,C =\n4VDD2 R′\nopt\nπ2(R′\nopt + Rs /n)2 = 4VDD2t\nπ2(t + 1)2 Rs /n. (20)\nThen, the ratio m can be determined by the following\nequation based on (18)–(20) whenPout,B = Pout,C :\nm = N\nn =\n( 2t + 1\nt + 1\n)2\n. (21)\nWhen t is much larger than 1,m is close to 4. Then, at state\nC, a quarter of main and auxillary PA unit cells are switched\nON with load impedance of 4Ropt. Also, other unit cells are\nﬂoated. From state C to D, the number of ﬂoated capacitors\nin main and auxiliary PAs remains unchanged. Meanwhile,\nthe switching unit cells in auxiliary PA are switched\nOFF\ngradually, which leads to limited AM–AM distortion due to\nthe similar operation with SCPA. At state D, the proposed\nSFCPA introduces the efﬁciencypeak at 12-dB PBO. The load\nimpedance of main PA is 2R\n′\nopt due to the Doherty operation.\nNote that no unit cell is ﬂoated in mode I. Meanwhile,\nthe number of ﬂoated unit cells is n in mode II, which is\nnot changed. The operations of states E and H (I or Q = 0)\nare similar to states A–D (I = Q). The detailed information\nof eight states (i.e., A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H) is summarized\nin Table I.\nY ANGet al.: QUADRATURE SFCPA WITH RSCCT FOR DEEP BACK-OFF EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT 3719\nTABLE I\nDETAILED OPERA TION STATES OF THE PROPOSED SFCPA\nFig. 8.

To avoid the amplitude discontinuity at mode\nswitch, the output power of states B and C should be the same.\nBased on (16), (17), and (22), the output power of states B\nand C can be calculated by\nP\n′\nout,B = 4VDD2 Ropt\nπ2(2Ropt + Rs /N)2 = 4VDD2t\nπ2(2t + 1)2 Rs /N (22)\nP′\nout,C = n2\n[n + (N − n)r]2 × 4VDD2\nπ2 R′\nopt\n= n2\n[n + (N − n)r]2 × 4VDD2\nπ2mR opt\n= n2\n[n + (N − n)r]2 × 4VDD2t\nπ2(t + 1)2 Rs /n. (23)\nThe number of switched-ON u n i tc e l la ts t a t eC( o rs t a t eG )\ncan be determined when P′\nout,B = P′\nout,C is required. Then,\nthe following relationship can be derived:\nm[1 + (m − 1)r]2 =\n( 2t + 1\nt + 1\n)2\n. (24)\nTherefore, when r = Cpar/C and t = N × R′\nopt/Rs\nare known, the variable m can be determined. Meanwhile,\nthe number of switched- ON unit cells at state C (or state\nG) is n = N/m. The DE of SFCPA considering Cpar is\nshown in Fig. 10. The parasitic capacitor caused by ﬂoated unit\ncell leads to the efﬁciency degradation in mode II. Moreover,\nin practical implementation, PBO efﬁciency at states B, D,\nF, and H would be degraded by nonideal elements, such as\nswitch loss and passive loss [18], which are not discussed in\nthis article.\n3720 IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, VOL. 56, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2021\nFig. 11. (a) Block diagram of the proposed SFCPA. (b) Schematic and detailed operation of SFCPA unit cell.\nIII. C IRCUIT IMPLEMENTATION\nA. Architecture\nThe block diagram of the proposed quadrature IQ cell\nshared SFCPA with hybrid Doherty, impedance boosting, and\nRSCCT is shown in Fig. 11(a). The SFCPA is introduced\nto decrease the dynamic power consumption, which bene-\nﬁts for PBO efﬁciency enhancement. Meanwhile, the hybrid\nDoherty and impedance boosting is used to further improve\nthe PA efﬁciency at PBO. The technique of hybrid Doherty\nand impedance boosting utilizes the reconﬁgurable matching\nnetwork with controllable impedance turn ratio to boost the\nload impedance of PA at PBO, which leads to efﬁciency\nenhancement. Besides, the IQ cell sharing technique is also\nemployed to improve the efﬁciency of quadrature PA.\nThe main and auxiliary PAs are composed of four identical\ndifferential IQ cell shared sub-PA arrays. Each sub-PA consists\nof 6-bit MSB controlled by thermometer codes and 1-bit LSB\nunit cells controlled by binary codes. The switched/ﬂoated\ncapacitor structure is utilized to implement the unit cell of sub-\nPA array. The unit cells can be switched among three operation\nstates (i.e.,\nON, OFF, and FLOAT). The output matching is\ncomposed of the 4-to-1 RSCCT with switched capacitor Ct\nand output capacitor Cout. The turn ratio of RSCCT can\nbe controlled to achieve impedance boosting, which further\nimproves the PA efﬁciency at PBO.\nThe quadrature LOs with 25% duty cycle are generated\nby a quadrature frequency divider. The quadrant of output\nsignal is selected by the sign-map circuit controlled by sign\nbits (i.e., Sign\nQ and SignI ). Four 1:9 deserializers are used\nto convert the serial BB signals (i.e., QM, IM, IA, and QA)\nto parallel 9-bit BB signals (i.e., BB QM,B BIM,B BIA,a n d\nBBQA). Among the parallel 9-bit BB signals, 7-bit BB signals\nare converted to 6-bit thermometer codes and 1-bit binary\ncodes by decoders, which controls the MSB and LSB unit\ncells of each sub-PA, respectively. The mode switch circuit is\nmainly composed of decoder and other logic control circuits.\nBB\nQM⟨7⟩ and BBQA⟨7⟩ are used as the enable signals of mode\nswitch circuit of main and auxillary PAs, respectively. Note\nthat BBQM⟨7⟩= BBQA⟨7⟩ in this work. n⟨5:0⟩ is the 6-bit\nbinary code, which represents the number of ﬂoated unit cells.\nThe ENn is enable signal of mode switch in each unit cell.\nWhen the enable signals (i.e., BBQM ⟨7⟩ and BBQA⟨7⟩)a r e\nactive, the mode switch circuit converts the binary coden⟨5:0⟩\ninto thermometer code ENn⟨62:0⟩, which controls the 6-bit\nMSB unit cells. Note thatn⟨5 : 0⟩ can be ﬁnely adjusted to\ncompensate for the PVT effect. Other BB signals are used to\ncontrol the quadrant (i.e., SignQ and SignI ) and RSCCT.\nB. Switched/Floated Capacitor Unit Cell\nThe schematic of the unit cell based on SFCPA is shown\nin Fig. 11(b). The cascode inverter structure with 2VDD\nsupply (i.e., 2.4 V) is used in the SFCPA unit cell to deliver\nhigher output power. The dimensions of NMOS and PMOS\nare 54 μm/40 nm and 108 μm/40 nm, respectively. The\nac-coupled capacitor is 60 fF. The voltage ofV\nbias is 1.9 V .\nAlso, its resistor is 5.2 k/Omega1. LOI and LOQ are quadrature LOs\nwith 25% duty cycle. BBI and BBQ are BB control signals for\nin-phase and quad-phase, respectively. EN is the enable signal\nof “FLOAT” state. CAP is 300 fF for 6-bit MSB. The CAP is\n150 fF for 1-bit LSB. The detailed operation of the SFCPA unit\ncell is shown in Fig. 12. In\nON state, the EN is 1. The capacitor\nCAP is switched between 2VDD and GND by the square\nwaveform with 50% duty cycle when BBI= BBQ = 1. When\nBBI or BBQ = 1, the capacitor CAP is switched between\n2VDD and GND by the square waveform with 75% duty cycle.\nIn the OFF state, BBI and BBQ are 0 and EN is 1. At present,\nNMOS N1 is switched ON a n dP M O SP 1i ss w i t c h e dOFF,\nwhich makes the CAP connected to GND. In the “FLOAT”\nstate, BBI, BBQ, and EN are 0. CAP is ﬂoated with both\nNMOS N1 and PMOS P1 switchedOFF.\nHowever, in practical implementation, the parasitic capac-\nitors of transistors, which leads to efﬁciency degradation,\nshould be considered. The schematic of SFCPA unit cell\nconsidering parasitic capacitor of in “FLOAT” state is shown\nin Fig. 12. When the unit cell is ﬂoated, the parasitic capacitors\nof transistors and CAP can be regarded as the single capacitor\nC\npar. The equivalent parasitic capacitance of Cpar is about\n95 fF for MSB unit cell seen by the output port.

(d) Effect of coupling coefﬁcientkpt on equivalent inductances\na n dt u r nr a t i on.\nresistance Rs /N (N = 63 for 6-bit MSB) is about 0.317/Omega1.\nThe load impedanceRopt at 0 dB PBO is designed to be 2.46/Omega1\nfor watt-level output power. Thus, the coefﬁcient t is about\n6.275 according to (16). The variablem is about 2 according\nto (24), which means that the load impedances of main and\nauxillary PAs are 2Ropt at state C or G. Then, the numbern is\ncalculated to be about 0.5N. Nearly, half of the unit cells are\nset to be switchedON. Also, nearly, half of the unit cells are\nﬂoated at state C (or state G), which delivers the same output\npower with state B (or state F).\nC. Reconﬁgurable Output Matching Network\nTo achieve the operation of the proposed SFCPA with hybrid\nDoherty and impedance boosting,the output matching network\nbased on RSCCT is introduced. The RSCCT is proposed\nwith enhanced tuning range of turn ratio, which could convert\ndifferent load impedance to output 50/Omega1.\n1) Reconﬁgurable Self-Coupling Canceling Transformer:\nThe circuit model of RSCCT is shown in Fig. 13(a).\nTo increase the turn ration of transformer, the equivalent sec-\nondary inductance L\nse is ﬁnely increased, while the equivalent\nprimary inductanceLpe needs to be unchanged. The equivalent\ncircuit of RSCCT is shown in Fig. 13(b). The extra inductor\nLt and tunable capacitorCt are introduced in the transformer.\nThe equivalent secondary inductanceLse is determined byCt\nand Lt EM coupled to Ls with coupling coefﬁcient kst [25].\nMeanwhile, the equivalent primary inductance Lpe is also\nFig. 14. Operation of the proposed RSCCT. (a) Case 1. (b) Case 2.\naffected by Lt and Ct due to the unwanted coupling between\nLt and L p with coupling factor kpt. The effect of undesired\ncoupling kpt on turn ratio n is shown in Fig. 13(d). Lse can\nbe adjusted in a large range, which implies a controllable turn\nratio n. However, the undesired couplingkpt leads to increased\nLpe with increasing Ct , which limits the tuning range of turn\nratio n. The tuning range ofn would be further limited with\nincreased kpt.\nTo solve this problem, the self-coupling canceling trans-\nformer is introduced. The detailed circuit implementation\nis shown in Fig. 13(c). The inductor L\nt is composed of\ntwo inductors Lt1 and Lt2 with opposite induced current.\nTo clearly explain the complex coupling relationships of\nthe RSCCT, two cases are discussed individually, as shown\nin Fig. 14(a) and (b), respectively. The induced current ofL\nt1\nand Lt2 is Ipt1 and Ipt2, respectively. In case 1, the secondary\ninductor Ls is not shown. L p is coupled identically with\nboth Lt1 and Lt2, which induces equivalent current Ipt 1 and\nIpt 2 with equal magnitude and opposite sign. Due to the\nintrinsically canceling ofIpt1 and Ipt2, the total currentIpt of Lt\nis zero, which means that unwanted coupling (i.e.,kpt) between\nL p and Lt is canceled. Meanwhile, in case 2, the primary\ninductor L p is not shown.Ls shows strong coupling withLt1\nand weak coupling withLt2. Then, the induced currentIst2 can\nbe ignored compared with Ist1. Thus, a relatively large total\ncurrent Ist of Lt is obtained, which implies a high coupling\nfactor of kst between Ls and Lt .\nThe simpliﬁed conﬁguration of the proposed RSCCT is\nshown in Fig. 15(a). The corresponding lumped model circuit\nof the RSCCT is shown in Fig. 16. The top thick metal\nlayers are used to implement the transformer for higher quality\nfactor Q. For better understanding, L\np and Ls are expressed\nin black and red, respectively. Lt1 and Lt2 are represented\nin blue. The tunable capacitor Ct is connected with Lt1.\nThe typical inductances of L p, Ls , Lt1,a n d Lt2 are 184,\n176, 205, and 70 pH, respectively. The coupling coefﬁcient\nof kps between L p and Ls is 0.83. The conﬁgurations for\ncases 1 and 2 are shown in Fig. 15(b) and (c), respectively.\nIn case 1, the conﬁguration ofLs is not shown. The inductor\nL p is located between Lt1 and Lt2. L p is coupled to Lt1 and\nLt2 with similar coupling factor, which generates currentsIpt1\nand Ipt2 with similar magnitude and opposite sign. The total\ncurrent Ipt of Lt is decreased due to intrinsically canceling of\nIpt1 and Ipt2. Then, the unwanted couplingkpt is suppressed.\nIn case 2, L p is not shown. Lt1 is located between the two\nparallel coils of Ls . Ls with parallel coils is coupled to Lt1\nwith enhanced coupling. Meanwhile, Lt2 is located far from\nLs , which leads to a relatively weak coupling. Thus, large total\n3722 IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, VOL. 56, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2021\nFig. 15.

Lumped model circuit of the RSCCT.\ncurrent of Lt is obtained, which means a strong coupling with\nfactor of kst between Ls and Lt .\nThe EM-simulated results of the RSCCT are shown\nin Fig. 17. As shown in Fig. 17(a),kpt is less than 0.3, while\nkst is larger than 0.5. kst/kpt with/without inductor Lt2 is\ncompared in Fig. 17(b). kst/kpt is signiﬁcantly increased by\nLt2. As shown in Fig. 17(c), whenCt is tuning within 3.5 pF,\nLse is signiﬁcantly increased from 176 to 218 pH with nearly\nconstant Lpe from 184 to 188 pH. The effect of Ct on\nequivalent quality factors of primary and secondary inductors\nis shown in Fig. 17(d).Qpe for primary inductor has shown a\nlittle degradation. Meanwhile,Qse of secondary inductor drops\nfrom 14.9 to about 7.1. The equivalent coupling coefﬁcients\nkpse and n/kpse are shown in Fig. 17(e) and (f), respectively.\nkpse is slightly effected byCt . n/kpse is signiﬁcantly increased\nwith increasing Ct . As shown in Fig. 16, a 2-bit switched\ncapacitor is used to implement Ct . The switched capacitors\nC1 and C2 are 1 and 2 pF, respectively. For better reliability\nof the switches, the cascode structure is adopted here.\n2) Output Matching Network Based on RSCCT:Based on\nthe RSCCT, the output matching network is shown in Fig. 18.\nThe differential output signals of main and auxiliary PAs are\ncombined and converted to single-ended output. A capacitor\nC\nout is located at single-ended output for optimized matching.\nThe load impedances ZLM and ZLA for main and auxiliary\nPAs are set to beRopt = 2.46 /Omega1at states A and E. Following\nthe previous theoretical analysis, ZLM and ZLA should be\nreconﬁgured to be 2Ropt at states C and G by the proposed\nRSCCT. The simulated ZLM across Ct at 2.4 GHz is shown\nin Fig. 19(a). The imaginary part of ZLM should be ﬁnely\ncompensated to be 0 by optimizing the matching network.\nThen, Ct is set to be 3 pF to achieve 2Ropt at states C and G.\nFig. 17.

Then, the simulated load impedances ZLM and ZLA\nversus PBO level at 2.4 GHz are shown in Fig. 20(a).

At state C, ZLM and ZLA are reconﬁgured to be about\n4.72 /Omega1. From 6- to 12-dB PBO, ZLM is increased, while\nZLA is decreased to 0. Based on the proposed reconﬁgurable\noutput matching network with RSCCT, the desired operation\ncan be obtained. The simulated power losses of the output\nmatching network are shown in Fig. 20(b). Three conditions\nof matching networks (i.e., mode I, mode II, and without extra\ntuning network Lt and Ct) are compared. The proposed output\nmatching network based on RSCCT features the minimal\npower loss of 1.05 and 1.27 dB at 2.8 GHz for modes I and II,\nrespectively. The power loss is less than 1.9 dB from 2.1 to\n3.6 GHz for modes I and II. The external tuning network with\nL\nt and Ct in mode II introduces about 0.27 dB extra power\nloss at 2.8 GHz comparing to the ﬁxed network withoutLt\nand Ct .\nIV . FABRICATION AND MEASUREMENT\nThe proposed quadrature SFCPA with RSCCT is fab-\nricated in a 40-nm CMOS technology, which occupies\n2m m × 1.1 mm, including all I/O pads with 1.2-/2.4-V sup-\nply, as shown in Fig. 21. The chip core size is only 1.3 mm×\n0.6 mm. The measurement setup is shown in Fig. 22. A signal\ngenerator is used to generate the 2LO signal. A wideband\nbalun converts the 2LO signal to differential, which feeds\nthe proposed SFCPA through the GSSG probe. Four serial\nbaseband signals (i.e., IA, QA, IM, and QM) are generated by\nthe arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and converted to four\nFig. 21. Die micrograph.\nFig. 22. Measurement setup.\n9-bit parallel signals (i.e.,BB IA⟨8:0⟩, BB QA⟨8:0⟩, BB IM⟨8:0⟩,\nand BB QM⟨8:0⟩) by four on-chip deserializers. Two sampling\nclocks (i.e., CLKH and CLKL with CLKH = 9CLKL )a r e\nintroduced by two extra signal generators. The frequency\nof the CLKH should be nine times of CLKL. The CLKH\nand CLKL are sinusoidal waveforms with 1.1-V peak-to-peak\nvoltage and 0.55-V dc biasing. Besides, the output signal of\nthe proposed SFCPA is attenuated by a 20-dB attenuator and\nmeasured by the spectrum analyzer.\nThe measured saturated output power, DE, and system\nefﬁciency (SE) versus frequency are shown in Fig. 23. The\nproposed SFCPA features a peak P\nsat of 30.3 dBm with a\nDE of 41.3% and an SE of 36.5% at 2.4 GHz. The 3-dB\noperational bandwidth is about 2.15–3.35 GHz. The power\ndissipation of core circuits, driving circuits, quadrature fre-\nquency divider, and all the logic blocks is considered in the SE\ncalculation. For CW measurement at 2.4 GHz, the power con-\nsumptions of the PA arrays, quadrature frequency divider, and\ndigital circuits (including decoders, deserializers, and buffers)\nat peak P\nsat are about 2593, 1, and 335 mW, respectively.\nThe measured DE and SE of the proposed SFCPA with\ntwo typical conditions versus output power at 2.4 GHz are\nshown in Fig. 24. The proposed SFCPA achieves DE of 41.3%,\n37.5%, 36.1%, 30.9%, 26.2%, and 20.2% at 0-, 3-, 6-, 9-,\n12-, and 15-dB PBOs. Meanwhile, it exhibits SE of 36.5%,\n3724 IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, VOL. 56, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2021\nFig. 23. Measured saturated output power and peak efﬁciency.\nFig. 24.

The measured DE and SE at various\nPBO levels over the frequency are shown in Fig. 25. The\nmeasured typical AM–AM/AM–PM distortions of condition\nI = Q and condition Q code = 0 at 2.4 GHz are shown\nin Fig. 26(a) and (b), respectively. At state C, nearly, half of\nthe main and auxiliary PAs are switchedON to deliver the same\noutput amplitude with state B, while other capacitor unit cells\nare ﬂoated at state C. Then, the proposed SFCPA introduces\na little amplitude discontinuity at mode switching. Besides,\nthe proposed SFCPA shows a little AM–AM distortion in each\noperation mode due to the similar operation with SCPA.\nThe proposed SFCPA introduces about 9.5\n◦ and 9.3◦ phase\ndiscontinuity at the mode switching for conditionI = Q and\nQ = 0, respectively. However, it exhibits a little AM–PM\ndistortion in each operation mode. Since the conditionI = Q\nand I/Q = 0 adopt the same output matching, the AM–AM\nand AM–PM distortions ofI = Q are similar to I/Q = 0.\nBased on the static AM–AM and AM–PM distortions, a 2-D\ndigital predistortion (DPD) is adopted to further minimize\nthe AM–AM and AM–PM distortions. The amplitude digital\ncontrol signals for QAM signal are pulse-shaped and ﬁltered\nby using a square-root raised cosine ﬁlter. The reconﬁgurable\nFig. 26.

The measured 60-MHz 64-QAM signal\nY ANGet al.: QUADRATURE SFCPA WITH RSCCT FOR DEEP BACK-OFF EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT 3725\nTABLE II\nCOMPARISON WITH STATE-OF -THE -ART QUADRATURE DIGITAL PAs\nshows the average output power (Pavg) of 24.17 dBm with an\naverage DE of 31.2%, an EVM of−31.7 dB, and an ACLR⩽\n−28.2 dBc. For 60-MHz 256-QAM signal, it features Pavg\nof 23.32 dBm with an average DE of 30.7%, an EVM of\n−3 1 . 9d B ,a n da nA C L R⩽ −30 dBc. Besides, the 40-MHz\n1024-QAM signal is also supported by the proposed SFCPA,\nwhich exhibits Pavg of 20.44 dBm with an average DE\nof 22.6%, an EVM of−35.9 dB, and an ACLR⩽ −34.88 dBc.\nThe out-of-band (OOB) spectra of 60-MHz 64-QAM, 60-MHz\n256-QAM, and 40-MHz 1024-QAM signals are shown\nin Fig. 28(a)–(c), respectively. The spectrum image is mainly\ncaused by the digitized and time-sampled interpolations of\nthe signal envelope [38]. The proposed DPA adopts the\npower digital-to-analog converters (DACs) based on zero-order\nhold (ZOH) interpolations, which introduces spectral images at\ninteger multiples of the sampling frequency [39]. The maximal\nsampling frequency is only 240 MHz, which limits the OOB\nspectrum, including the spectral image suppression and OOB\nspectrum noise ﬂoor. The larger sampling frequency would\nmove the replicas to higher offset, which enhances the OOB\nspectrum performance. Note that the jump-based discontinuity\ncaused by mode switch increases the duration and amplitude\nof the glitch, which leads to performance degradation of EVM,\nACLR, and OOB noise. To enhance the performance of EVM,\nACLR, and OOB noise, higher BB sampling frequency and\nhigher resolution of power-DAC should be used. Besides,\nthe jump-based discontinuity should be avoided and limited\nat mode switch by circuit optimization.\nFig. 29(a) shows the measured EVM and ACLR\nof 256-QAM and 1024-QAM modulation signals versus sym-\nbol rate. The modulation signals transmit the maximal P\navg\nwithout PBO. With constant maximal 240-MHz sampling\nfrequency, the modulation signal with higher symbol shows\nlower up-sampling rate. The lower up-sampling rate leads to\nEVM degradation, especially for higher order QAM signal.\nIt can be seen that the EVM of 1024-QAM signal increases\nmore sharply with increased symbol rate comparing to the\n256-QAM signal, as shown in Fig. 11. Thus, the EVM\nof 10-MHz 1024-QAM signal (i.e., −38.71 dB) is much\nFig. 29. (a) Measured EVM and ACLR of modulation signals versus symbol\nrate. (b) Measured EVM and ACLR of modulation signals versus average\noutput power P\navg.\nlower than that of 10-MHz 256-QAM signal (i.e., −36.71),\nwhile the EVM of 50-MHz 1024-QAM is higher than that\nof 50-MHz 256-QAM. The measured EVM and ACLR of\nmodulation signals versus Pavg are shown in Fig. 29(b). The\nEVM and ACLR of 256-QAM and 1024-QAM modulation\nsignals could be further improved at proper PBO level. The\ncomparison with previous state-of-the-art quadrature DPAs is\nshown in Table II. The proposed quadrature SFCPA exhibits\nwatt-level P\nout of 30.3 dBm with an SE of 36.5%. More-\nover, without supply switching, the PA efﬁciency is effec-\ntively improved at 0-/3-/6-/9-/12-/15-dB PBO, which leads to\nhigher average efﬁciency. Besides, the proposed SFCPA could\nsupport the complex modulation signals, such as 256- and\n1024-QAM signals.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this article, a quadrature SFCPA is presented with\nRSCCT for deep PBO efﬁciency enhancement. The SFCPA,\nwhich decreases the dynamic power consumption required\nto charge and discharge capacitor array, introduces efﬁciency\nenhancement at PBO.
