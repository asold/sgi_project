INTRODUCTION\nDC bias is an abnormal working condition that often occurs\nin the operation of transformers. As the DC current ﬂows\ninto the neutrals of the transformer with the neutral grounded,\nthe DC magnetic ﬂux of the iron core is superimposed on the\nAC magnetic ﬂux, and the magnetic ﬂux of the transformer is\nshifted, thus the DC bias occurs. There are three main reasons\nfor DC bias of transformers: geomagnetic storm caused by\nsolar activity, the unipolar operation of the DC transmission\nsystem, and stray current of rail transit [1]–[3]. DC bias\neasily leads to local overheating, the aggravation of noise\nand vibration of transformers, and mal-operation operation of\nrelay protection. It will seriously threaten the safe operation\nof power transformers [4]. So, how to identify the DC bias\nstate of transformers is of vital importance.\nDC bias identiﬁcation is also an important foundation to\nensure the reliable operation of the urban power grid and to\narrange the maintenance strategy reasonably. In the current\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Anubha Gupta\n.\nresearch on DC bias of transformer, the correlation between\nthe transformer circuit and the magnetic circuit is mainly\nused to establish a mathematical and simulation model. Then,\nthe excitation current and its distortion rate are calculated\nto analyze the DC bias of transformers [5], [6]. However,\nthe excitation current is not easy to be measured in the actual\nrunning of the transformer. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to meet\nthe requirements of on-line supervision for the operation state\nof power transformers.\nDC bias will intensify the vibration of transformers [7].\nThe vibration signals are collected through vibration sen-\nsors adsorbed on the transformer tank. Then the character-\nistics of vibration signals are analyzed to identify the state\nof transformers. Thus, the operation state of transformers\ncan be observed through vibration detection, which can be\nperformed online [8]. Aiming to deal with nonstationary\nsignals like vibration signals, many methods have been pro-\nposed, such as, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and\nthe Hilbert spectrum [9], [10], Fourier decomposition method\n(FDM) [11], a new formulation of the FDM using the discrete\ncosine transform [12]. The vibration characteristics before\n58944 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Liuet al.: State Identification of Transformer Under DC Bias Based on Wavelet Singular Entropy\nand after DC bias are compared and analyzed in [13]–[15],\nand the characteristic quantities of DC bias are obtained in\nthe time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain.\nHowever, the obtained characteristic quantities are not further\napplied to DC bias state identiﬁcation of transformers.\nIn terms of DC bias identiﬁcation, characteristic parame-\nters such as odd to even harmonic ratio, spectrum complexity,\nand wavelet packet energy are proposed in [16]. And then\nthe principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector\nmachine (SVM) method are used to identify the DC bias\nof transformers. However, vibration signals of transformers\nare non-stationary signals. The traditional Fourier transform,\nwhich is not suitable for nonstationary signals, will lead\nto low reliability and accuracy for DC bias identiﬁcation.\nTherefore, a large number of scholars have studied wavelet\ntransform for different application, and proposed a series of\nnew wavelet methods, which have great achievement in signal\nprocessing [17]–[22]. Wavelet transform has been effectively\napplied to the characteristic analysis of vibration signals,\nwhich is a typical method for non-stationary signal analysis.\nHowever, it is not only the computational complexity, but\nalso the energy leakage and aliasing that solely rely on the\nwavelet decomposition method to extract the transient signal\ncharacteristics of the power system, and the signal feature\nextraction effect will also be affected.\nEntropy is a powerful and effective tool to extract fault\ncharacteristics, which has been widely used in the state iden-\ntiﬁcation. Entropy can not only represent the complexity of\nsignal, but also measure the uncertainty of system or signal,\nso it is perfect for dealing with vibration signal of trans-\nformers. In the aspect of entropy, many scholars have done\na lot of research and made great achievement [23]–[32].\nHowever, the main purpose of this paper is to choose a simple\nand efﬁcient entropy approach to identify the DC bias of\ntransformer in real time. Most of the entropy approaches\nmentioned above have problems, such as, low computational\nefﬁciency, complicated calculation and low noise immunity.\nAs a result, by combining wavelet transform and information\nentropy, the wavelet entropy is proposed, which combines the\nunique advantages of the wavelet transform in the processing\nof the irregular abnormal signal and statistical properties of\nthe information entropy in the signal complexity.\nSingular value decomposition (SVD) is sensitive to the\nfault features of signals, and has a good effect of noise\nelimination. Thus, based on the wavelet entropy and singular\nvalue decomposition theory, the wavelet singular entropy is\nproposed. Wavelet singular entropy is used widely for electric\npower system automatic fault detection [33]–[35], which is\nhighly suitable for measuring the uncertainty and complexity\nof the analyzed signals and is sensitive to transient signals\ngenerated by faults. Thus, based on the continuous wavelet\ntransform, the wavelet singular entropy of vibration signal is\nobtained as the characteristic quantity to identify the DC bias\nof transformers in this paper.\nTo identify the DC bias of transformers, the vibra-\ntion principle of transformers under DC bias is analyzed.\nBy combining continuous wavelet transform, singular value\ndecomposition, and information entropy, the analysis method\nof wavelet singular entropy is proposed. The vibration signals\nof transformers before and after DC bias are transformed by\ncontinuous wavelet transform. And then the wavelet time-\nfrequency diagram is compared and analyzed. Based on con-\ntinuous wavelet transform and singular value decomposition,\nthe wavelet singular entropy of vibration signals is obtained.\nThe result shows that the wavelet singular entropy can effec-\ntively reﬂect the DC bias state of transformers. Thus, a DC\nbias state identiﬁcation method based on wavelet singular\nentropy is proposed. Then the method is applied to a 500 kV\ntransformer and a 220 kV transformer in the China Southern\nPower Grid, and the results prove the accuracy and effective-\nness of this method.\nII. ANALYSIS OF VIBRATION PRINCIPLE OF\nTRANSFORMERS UNDER DC BIAS\nThe vibration signals of transformers are mainly the winding\nvibration and the core vibration, which transmit to the wall\nof transformers through different paths. On the one hand,\nthe core vibration is caused by magnetostriction effects due\nto magnetization of the core. Within a certain magnetic ﬂux\nrange, the magnetostriction of the iron core is approximately\nproportional to the square of the magnetic ﬂux. The magne-\ntostriction of the core is:\nλ=1\n2αB2\na (cos 2ωt +1). (1)\nwhere α is a constant related to the core material, Ba is\nthe magnitude of ﬂux density, ωis the frequency of supply\nvoltage.\nOn the other hand, the winding vibration is caused by the\nelectromagnetic force due to leakage ﬂux associated with\nthe current. The vibration signal of transformer winding is\nproportional to the square of the load current. Thus, the elec-\ntrodynamic force acting on the winding coil is:\nF =1\n2pI2 (cos 2ωt +1). (2)\nwhere p is the electrodynamic coefﬁcient, and I is the magni-\ntude of load current. In summary, the fundamental frequency\nof the core vibration signal is twice that of the power supply\nvoltage, and the fundamental frequency of the winding vibra-\ntion signal is twice that of the load current [36].\nExcessive DC current ﬂowing through the earthed neutral\nwill lead to DC bias of transformers. Under DC bias, the DC\nﬂux produced by excessive DC current is superimposed on\nAC ﬂux, resulting in a signiﬁcant increase in the ﬂux density\nin half period. The magnetic ﬂux curve presents the phe-\nnomenon that the upper and lower half waves are asymmetric\nand the saturation occurs once every half period. The oper-\nating point of the magnetization curve enters the nonlinear\nsaturation region, resulting in an aggravation of distortion\nand an increase of the magnitude of excitation current [6].\nThe distortion of excitation current will lead to higher-order\nharmonic components in the winding current and the ﬂux\nVOLUME 9, 2021 58945\nJ. Liuet al.: State Identification of Transformer Under DC Bias Based on Wavelet Singular Entropy\nFIGURE 1. The relation between magnetic flux and magnetostriction of\nthe core under DC bias.\nof core, and the magnitude of each harmonic component\nincreases. Under DC bias, it can be considered that the DC\nﬂux is superimposed on the AC ﬂux of the transformer core.\nThe relationship between magnetic ﬂux and magnetostriction\nunder DC bias is shown in Fig. 1 [37].\nUnder DC bias, the magnitude of vibration signals\nincreases. Compared with the normal state, due to the dis-\ntortion of the excitation current, the frequency components\nof the core and winding vibration signals become compli-\ncated, and the odd multiple harmonics and the higher orders\nharmonics also occur obviously. After the appearance of DC\nbias, each frequency band of vibration signals changed, and\nthe attenuation or enhancement varied in different frequency\nbands [37].\nIII. DEFINITION OF WAVELET SINGULAR ENTROPY\nWavelet analysis reﬂects the characteristic change of\nvibration signal in the time-domain and frequency-domain\nsimultaneously. Singular value decomposition can obtain\ntime-frequency characteristics. And information entropy\nenergy can calculate the uncertainty and complexity of sig-\nnals. Therefore, by combining wavelet analysis, singular\ndecomposition, and information entropy, the characteristics\nof vibration signals under DC bias are obtained.\nA. THE CONTINUOUS WAVELET TRANSFORMER\nThe continuous wavelet transform uses different nodes\nto reﬂect different frequency ranges, and can more intu-\nitively reﬂect the details of original signals. It has good\ntime-frequency localization ability. The continuous wavelet\ntransform of signal f is deﬁned as:\n(\nWψf\n)\n(a,b)=\n⟨\nf ,ψa,b\n⟩\n=|a|−1\n2\n∫ ∞\n−∞\nf (t)ψ\n(t −b\na\n)\ndt.\n(3)\nwhere a and b are scale factor and shift factor respectively;\n⟨⟩denotes the inner product; ψ(t)is the complex conjugate\nof ψ(t), ψ(t) is the parent wavelet function; ψa,b(t) is a con-\ntinuous wavelet function. If the function ψ ∈L1 (R)∩L2 (R)\nand ˆψ(0) =0, then ψa,b(t) can be obtained by scaling and\nshifting from ψ(t):\nψa,b (t)=|a|−1\n2 ψ\n(t −b\na\n)\n. (4)\nThe scale factor a determines the bandwidth and center\nfrequency of the bandpass ﬁlter [38]. The wavelet function of\neach scale a has different frequency band range and different\nfrequency center. Therefore, the wavelet coefﬁcient reﬂects\nthe content of the frequency component around the frequency\ncenter. If the magnitude of the wavelet coefﬁcient is high,\nthere are more frequency components around the frequency\ncenter [39]. The corresponding relation between scale and\nfrequency is:\nFa =fs ·Fc\na . (5)\nwhere a is the scale factor, Fc is the central frequency of the\nwavelet, and fs is the sampling frequency.\nB. THE WAVELET SINGULAR ENTROPY\nInformation entropy is an important measure for evaluating\nthe uncertainty of analyzed data. The higher the information\nentropy is, the higher the disorder degree of information, and\nthe smaller the contribution of information [40]. Supposing\nthat several different states occur in a system X: {x 1, x2, . . . ,\nxn}, p(xi) is the probability of each state xi, 0 ≤pi ≤1, and∑pi =1. Then the information entropy H(X) of the system\nX is deﬁned as:\nH (X)=−\nn∑\ni=1\np (xi)log (p (xi)). (6)\nIn scale j (j =1, 2, ..., m), the wavelet coefﬁcient Dj(n) can\nbe obtained after wavelet transform. Thus, the decomposition\nresults of m scales will form an m ×n order matrix Dm×n\nBased on the singular value decomposition theory, there must\nbe an m ×m order matrix U, an n ×n order matrix V , and\nan l ×l order matrix 3, makes the m ×n order matrix D be\ndecomposed into:\nDm×n =Um×m\n(3l×l 0\n0 0\n)\nm×n\nV T\nn×n. (7)\nwhere\n3l×l =\n\n\n\nλ1 0 · 0 0\n0 λ2 · 0 0\n· · λi · ·\n0 0 · λl−1 0\n0 0 · 0 λl\n\n\n\n. (8)\nand its diagonal elements λi are the singular value of the\nmatrix obtained by the wavelet transform. The singular values\nare nonnegative and arranged in nonincreasing order, namely\nλ1 ≥λ2 ≥···≥ λl > 0. The singular wavelet entropy is\ndeﬁned as:\nWSE =\nl∑\ni=1\n−\n\nλi/\nl∑\nj=1\nλj\n\nln\n\nλi/\nl∑\nj=1\nλj\n\n. (9)\nWavelet singular entropy provides brieﬂy numerical repre-\nsentation for the uncertainty of the time-frequency distribu-\ntion of vibration signals. Wavelet singular entropy maps the\ncorrelative wavelet space into independent linearity space,\n58946 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Liuet al.: State Identification of Transformer Under DC Bias Based on Wavelet Singular Entropy\nand it is sensitive to the transient signals produced by the\nfaults. The simpler the analyzed signals are, the more con-\ncentrated the energy, and the smaller the wavelet singular\nentropy. On the contrary, the more complex the signals are,\nthe more dispersed the energy, and the higher the wavelet\nsingular entropy. The wavelet singular entropy is suitable for\nmeasuring the complexity and uncertainty of the analyzed\nsignals, and provide a quantitative and intuitive outcome for\nthe state identiﬁcation research [41].\nIV. IDENTIFICATION METHOD OF DC BIAS BASED ON\nWAVELET SINGULAR ENTROPY\nFrom section I, it can be known that the vibration signal\nchanges both in time and frequency domain. Continuous\nwavelet transform characterizes the DC bias of vibration\nsignals in the time domain and frequency domain. However,\nthe intuitive distribution of the time-frequency domain is\nnot sufﬁcient to identify the DC bias state of transformers.\nConsidering that singular value decomposition obtains the\nfault features of signals, and information entropy reﬂects the\nuncertainty and complexity of signals, the wavelet singular\nentropy is used to quantify the time-frequency characteristics\nof DC bias. Based on that, the DC bias of transformers can be\nmore simply and quickly reﬂected. Based on characteristics\nof DC bias obtained by wavelet singular entropy, a DC bias\nidentiﬁcation method based on wavelet singular entropy is\nproposed.\nA. CHARACTERISTIC ANALYSIS OF VIBRATION SIGNAL\nUNDER DC BIAS\nTo obtain characteristics of DC bias, the continuous wavelet\ntransform is performed on the collected vibration signals,\nand the wavelet time-frequency diagrams with and without\nDC bias are compared and analyzed. The singular value\ndecomposition of the wavelet coefﬁcient matrix obtained by\ncontinuous wavelet transform is carried out, and then the\nwavelet singular entropy of the transformer is obtained.\nThe vibration detection of a 500 kV main transformer in the\nChina Southern Power Grid was carried out. The CJBPZ-1\nvelocity vibration sensor is used to collect vibration signals\nat the lower-middle position of the side of the transformer\ntanks, and the sampling frequency is 2000 Hz. Then, con-\ntinuous wavelet transform function (CWT) in MATLAB is\nused for the wavelet analysis of vibration signals. Daubechies\nseries wavelets are orthogonal and compact supported, and\nare sensitive to irregular signals. Therefore, the db4 wavelet\nis selected as the mother wavelet function of the wavelet\ntransform in this paper.\nBy combining the above principle analysis of vibration\nsignals and the existing research on vibration signals of trans-\nformers, it is found that the magnitude of 50 Hz frequency\nmultiplier components of vibration signals is signiﬁcantly\ngreater than that of other frequency components. Therefore,\nthe center of frequency window of each scale y1, y2, ...,\ny20 is set as the frequency multiplier of 50 Hz, namely 50,\n100, ...and 1000 Hz. According to the sampling theorem,\nFIGURE 2. Monitored vibration waveform under DC bias and no DC bias.\nthe sampling frequency is fs, so the actual frequency range of\nthe signal is fs/2. To make the frequency range of the wavelet\ntransform to be fs/2, according to (5), the wavelet transform\nscale yn is selected as:\nyn =2Fcfs\nFa\n=2FcN\nn . (10)\nwhere Fc is the center frequency of the mother wavelet, and\nFa is the frequency center of the frequency window in yn\nscale. Choose N =20, n =1, 2, 3, ..., and 20. And the center\nfrequency of db4 mother wavelet function is 0.714 Hz.\nThe continuous wavelet transform is applied to the vibra-\ntion signals of the transformer under DC bias and no DC\nbias. The waveforms of vibration signals are shown in Fig. 2,\nand the time-frequency diagram after continuous wavelet\ntransform is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe wavelet time-frequency diagrams of vibration signal\nunder DC bias and no DC bias are signiﬁcantly different.\nFrom Fig. 3 (a), the vibration signal is mainly distributed in\nthe low-frequency band (0 Hz to 0.4 kHz). Whereas the distri-\nbution of the high-frequency band (0.4 kHz to 1 kHz) is very\nsmall. The frequency distribution is relatively concentrated,\nand the wavelet coefﬁcients in the high-frequency band are\nsigniﬁcantly smaller than those in the low-frequency band.\nFrom Fig. 3 (b), the wavelet coefﬁcients in the low-frequency\nband and the high-frequency band increase. The frequency\ndistribution is relatively divergent. The wavelet coefﬁcients\nof the low-frequency band are still larger than those of the\nhigh-frequency band. The wavelet coefﬁcients of transform-\ners in the same state but at different scales have different\nmagnitudes and different distribution rules. Therefore, the\nwavelet transform can be used to obtain characteristics of the\nDC bias state of transformers.\nThe singular value decomposition of the wavelet coef-\nﬁcient matrix obtained after the above continuous wavelet\ntransform is carried out. And the singular value matrix under\nDC bias and no DC bias is obtained. According to the deﬁni-\ntion of wavelet singular entropy, the wavelet singular entropy\nWSE1 under no DC bias is 1.67, and the wavelet singular\nentropy WSE2 under DC bias is 2.11.

Wavelet singular entropy under DC bias and no DC bias.\nsingular entropy are obtained with the sliding of the time\nwindow. The changing trends of wavelet singular entropy of\na 500 kV transformer under DC bias and no DC bias in three\nconsecutive days are selected, as shown in Fig. 4.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 4, the difference of wavelet\nsingular entropy between DC bias and no DC bias is obvious.\nUnder no DC bias, the wavelet singular entropy ﬂuctuates\nmainly in the range from 1.6 to 1.7. Whereas under DC\nbias, the wavelet singular entropy increases signiﬁcantly and\nmainly ﬂuctuates in the range from 2 to 2.2. Thus, the wavelet\nsingular entropy value is used as the characteristic quantity\nFIGURE 5. Identification flow chart of DC bias.\nto identify the DC bias state of transformers. Moreover,\nthe threshold M is set as 1.8 to judge whether the transformer\nis under DC bias. If so, the transformer is judged to be under\nDC bias.\nB. IDENTIFICATION METHOD OF DC BIAS\nBased on the above analysis, a DC bias state identiﬁcation\nmethod based on wavelet singular entropy is proposed in this\nwork. The ﬂow chart is shown in Fig. 5.\nSpeciﬁc steps are as follows:\n1) Continuous wavelet transform is carried out for the\ncollected transformer vibration signals to obtain the wavelet\ncoefﬁcients at various scales.\n2) The singular value decomposition of the wavelet coefﬁ-\ncient matrix is carried out to obtain the singular value of the\nwavelet coefﬁcient matrix.\n3) According to (9), the wavelet singular entropy WSE is\ncalculated.\n4) The wavelet singular entropy in different states of trans-\nformer is different, so the DC bias of transformers can be\nidentiﬁed by the wavelet singular entropy.\n5) The wavelet singular entropy is compared with the\nthreshold M. If WSE > M, it can be judged that the trans-\nformer appears DC bias phenomenon. If WSE < M, repeat\nsteps from 1 to 5 with a step length of 1/20 s. The transformer\nwith different structures and parameters will have different\nthresholds. Thus, in the actual application, the threshold M\nis determined based on the analysis of a large number of\nmeasured data and expert experience.\nV. APPLICATION AND VERIFICATION OF\nIDENTIFICATION METHOD\nTo verify the feasibility and accuracy of the method while\nidentifying the state of transformers in operation, based on\n58948 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Liuet al.: State Identification of Transformer Under DC Bias Based on Wavelet Singular Entropy\nFIGURE 6. Scene diagrams while testing.\nthe method proposed above, the following works are carried\nout: Initially, vibration signals of a 500 kV transformer in the\nChina Southern Power Grid are monitored in real-time, and\nthe wavelet singular entropy of vibration signals is obtained\nto identify the DC bias of the transformer. Then, the neutral\nDC monitored at the same time is used to verify whether\nthe conclusion obtained by wavelet singular entropy is cor-\nrect. Finally, to verify the applicability of this method for\ntransformers with multiple voltage levels, this identiﬁcation\nmethod is applied to a 220 kV transformer in the China\nSouthern Power Grid.\nA. CASE ANALYSIS 1\nThe 500 kV transformer in the China Southern Power Grid is\nselected as the monitoring object. The type of the transformer\nis ODFPSZ9-250000/525/\n√\n3. Its rated current is 824.8 A\nand it is a single-phase three-coil transformer with on-load\ntap changer. A large number of historical measured vibra-\ntion signals are analyzed and processed, and according to\nthe expert experience and knowledge, the threshold M of\nthe transformer is set as 1.8. The vibration signal and the\nneutral DC current within an hour from 5:22 to 6:22 am\non May 11, 2019, are monitored in real-time with a sam-\npling frequency of 2000 Hz. The CJBPZ-1 velocity vibration\nsensor is used to collect vibration signals at the lower-\nmiddle position of the side of the transformer tanks. And the\nHDIE-C41-100P1O23 DC Holzer sensor is used to collect\nthe neutral DC of the transformer, as shown in Fig. 6. And\nthe waveforms of vibration signal and neutral DC monitored\nfrom 5:22 to 6:22 am on May 11, 2019, are shown in Fig. 7.\nAccording to Fig. 7, the magnitude of vibration signals\nﬂuctuates between 0-2.5 m/s during the period from 5:22 to\n5:52, it began to rise during the period from 5:52 to 6:02, and\nit ﬂuctuates between 0.5-4 m/s during the period from 6:02 to\n6:22. Compared with the time before 5:52, the magnitude and\nﬂuctuation range of the vibration signal presents an upward\ntrend in the period from 5:52 to 6:02, whereas they are larger\nin the period from 6:02 to 6:22. According to Fig. 5, the\ntime window is selected as 2 s and the step length is 1/20 s.\nWith the sliding of the time window, the curves of wavelet\nFIGURE 7. The waveform of vibration signal and neutral DC current.\nFIGURE 8. The curves of wavelet singular entropy.\nsingular entropy of vibration signal changing with time can\nbe obtained, as shown in Fig. 8.\nBefore 5:52, the wavelet singular entropy ﬂuctuates in a\nsmall range around 1.65, with the minimum value of 1.61 and\nthe maximum value of 1.69. Within about ten minutes after\n5:52, the wavelet singular entropy presents a trend of con-\ntinuous increase, and its value continuously increasing to\n2.1. After 6:02, the wavelet singular entropy ﬂuctuates in a\nsmall range around 2.1, with a minimum value of 2.02 and\na maximum value of 2.15. Therefore, it is judged that the\ntransformer is under DC bias during the period from 5:32 to\n5:52. In the period from 5:52 to 6:02, the transformer gradu-\nally begins to appear DC bias. The transformer is under DC\nbias during the period from 6:02 to 6:22.\nAccording to technical speciﬁcation for HVDC Trans-\nmission Land Return Operation System Design (DL/T\n5224-2014), the permissible neutral DC of all kinds of\ntransformers can be as follows: 0.3% of rated current for a\nsingle-phase transformer, 0.5% of rated current for a three-\nphase three-pole transformer, and 0.7% of rated current for a\nthree-phase ﬁve-pole transformer. The degree of DC bias is\nclosely related to the DC current ﬂowing in the winding of\nthe transformer. Therefore, 0.3% of the rated current is taken\nas the neutral DC allowed for the transformer. In other words,\nwhether the neutral DC is greater than 5 A is used to judge\nwhether the transformer is under DC bias.\nAnd it can be known from Fig. 7 that, within the period\nfrom 5:22 to 5:52, the maximum and minimum values of\nthe magnitude of neutral DC are 1.441 A and −0.913 A,\nand the ﬂuctuation range is 2.354 A. The magnitude of the\nneutral DC of the transformer and its magnitude variation\nVOLUME 9, 2021 58949\nJ. Liuet al.: State Identification of Transformer Under DC Bias Based on Wavelet Singular Entropy\nFIGURE 9. The waveform of the vibration signal.\nrange is relatively small. Within the period from 5:52 to 6:02,\nthe magnitude of the neutral DC increases gradually. Within\nthe period from 6:02 to 6:22, the maximum and minimum\nvalues of the magnitude of the neutral DC are 11.59 A and\n−18.76 A, and the ﬂuctuation range reaches 30 A. The\nmagnitude of the neutral DC increases signiﬁcantly, and its\nmagnitude changes in a wide range. Thus, the transformer is\nunder no DC bias from 5:22 to 5:52, it begins to appear DC\nbias from 5:52 to 6:02, and it is under DC bias from 6:02 to\n6:22. The above conclusions are consistent with the results\nbased on wavelet singular entropy, showing the feasibility of\nthe method proposed in this paper.\nDuring the operation of the urban rail transit system,\nthe stray current is easily generated. Part of the stray current\nmay ﬂow into the neutrals of the transformer with the neutral\ngrounded, which makes the working point of the magnetiza-\ntion curve deviate and causes DC bias. The shortest distance\nof the transformer from the train line is 600 m. The trans-\nformer is greatly affected by the stray current caused by urban\nrail transit. The ﬁrst train departed at 5:52 am, coinciding\nwith the start time of abnormal vibration of the transformer.\nThere is no DC grounding pole near the area where the test\ntransformer is located. Therefore, it is concluded that DC bias\nis caused by stray current rather than HVDC transmission.\nPart of the stray current generated by running trains ﬂows\ninto the neutral grounded transformer, then result in DC bias.\nThe train starts to leave after 5:52, the continuous operation\nof trains will generate stray current, which makes the trans-\nformer under DC bias constantly. Therefore, the train starts at\n5:52 and the transformer will continue to be affected by DC\nbias. The above conclusions are consistent with the results\nbased on wavelet singular entropy, which proves the accuracy\nand effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper again.\nB. CASE ANALYSIS 2\nThe 220 kV main transformer in the China Southern Power\nGrid is selected as the monitoring object. The type of the\ntransformer is SFSZ11-K-240000/220. Its rated current is\n699.8 A and it is a three-phase three-coil transformer with\non-load tap changer. A large number of historical measured\nvibration signals are analyzed and processed, and according\nto the expert experience and knowledge, the threshold M\nof the transformer is set as 1.8. The same data acquisition\nmethod as in case 1 is selected to monitor vibration signals of\ntransformers. The vibration signal is shown in Fig. 9.\nThe vibration signal of the transformer is analyzed and\nprocessed by the DC bias identiﬁcation method proposed\nFIGURE 10. The curves of wavelet singular entropy.\nFIGURE 11. The waveform of neutral DC current.\nin this paper. And the curve of wavelet singular entropy\nchanging with time is shown in Fig. 10.\nDuring this period, the wavelet singular entropy is always\ngreater than the threshold value of 1.8, which indicates that\nthe transformer is under DC bias. According to technical\nspeciﬁcations for HVDC Transmission Land Return Oper-\nation System Design (DL/T 5224-2014), the neutral DC\nallowed to pass through the three-phase three-column trans-\nformer is 0.5% of rated current. Therefore, the value of\nneutral DC is compared with 3.5 A. If it is larger than 3.5,\nthe transformer is under DC bias. The same data acquisition\nmethod as in case analysis 1 is selected to monitor the neutral\nDC of the transformer. The waveform of neutral DC is shown\nin Fig. 11.\nDuring this period, the amplitude of the neutral DC is\nalways greater than 3.5 A, so the transformer is under DC\nbias. It is consistent with the conclusions obtained by the\nDC bias identiﬁcation method proposed in this paper. The\naccuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method for trans-\nformers with multiple voltage levels are further veriﬁed.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nBased on wavelet singular entropy, the vibration signal char-\nacteristics of transformers under DC bias are obtained, and a\nstate identiﬁcation method of transformers under DC bias is\nproposed. The main conclusions are as follows:\n1) The difference of the wavelet coefﬁcients between\nDC bias and no DC bias is obvious. Under no DC bias,\nthe vibration signal is mainly distributed in the low-frequency\nband (0 Hz to 0.4 kHz), whereas the distribution of the\nhigh-frequency band (0.4 kHz to 1 kHz) is very small.\nThe frequency distribution is relatively concentrated, and the\nwavelet coefﬁcient in the high-frequency band is signiﬁcantly\nlower than those in the low-frequency band. However, under\nDC bias, the wavelet coefﬁcients in the low-frequency band\nand the high-frequency band increase, and the frequency\ndistribution is relatively divergent.\n58950 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Liuet al.: State Identification of Transformer Under DC Bias Based on Wavelet Singular Entropy\n2) The wavelet singular entropy of transformer under DC\nbias state is signiﬁcantly greater than that under no DC bias.\nWavelet singular entropy is sensitive to DC bias of trans-\nformer, and can effectively detect and identify the DC bias\nstate.\n3) Based on the wavelet singular entropy of vibration\nsignal, a DC bias state identiﬁcation method is proposed. This\nmethod is applied to a 500 kV transformer and a 220 kV\ntransformer in the China Southern Power Grid. The results\nprove the feasibility and accuracy of this method.\nREFERENCES\n[1] P. R.
