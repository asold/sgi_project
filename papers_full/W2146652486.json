    "full_text": "General Commentary\npublished: 04 April 2011\ndoi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00053\nAffordances, adaptive tool use and grounded cognition\nAntonello Pellicano1*, Serge Thill2, T om Ziemke2 and Ferdinand Binkofski1\n1 S ection of Neurological Cognition Research, Department of Neurology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\n2 S chool of Humanities and Informatics, University of Skövde, Skövde, Sweden\n*Correspondence: apellicano@ukaachen.de\nbut would not recall its proper use; con-\nsequently, no information can be sent to \nneurobiomechanics. This would be a more \n“central” deficit than the authors’ example, \ncharacterized by a worse performance.\nThe role of affordances\nIn our opinion the model would be \nimproved if affordance for action mecha-\nnisms were integrated: The potentiation \nof motor interactions consistent with the \nconventional use of a perceived tool (Bub \net\n \nal., 2008).\nAffordances would easily explain the \nmechanism underlying the quick choice of \nthe most appropriate tool when an action \ngoal is given. In Figure 1A, bidirectional \nconnections between available tools and \nusage contexts represent the automatic \nactivation of stable affordances (Borghi \nand Riggio, 2009) emerging from invari-\nant features of the tool (mainly its func-\ntional meaning) incorporated into the \nobject representation in long term memory \n(e.g., a spoon typically stirs and scoops, a \nknife cuts and spreads). Activation of sta-\nble affordances is independent of context \nor task to be carried out. Furthermore, for \neach stable affordance, variable affordances \nemerging from temporary characteristics of \nthe tools such as their current handle ori-\nentation are also activated.\nWhen an action goal is given (stir the \ncoffee), attention is restricted to a specific \naction context (to stir) and oriented to \navailable and action-consistent tools (spoon \nand stirrer). Thus, activation of a restricted \nnumber of stable and variable affordances is \nprivileged (e.g., “spoon\n +\n t\no stir” and “stir-\nrer\n +\n t\no stir” with the right hand) over those \nnot consistent with the action goal. Here, the \ncontroller will select “spoon\n + t\no stir” instead \nof “stirrer + t\no stir” and execute the required \naction with the hand corresponding to the \nhandle orientation. Selection between two \nequally appropriate tools is assumed to be \ndetermined by stronger stable and variable \naffordances being activated.\nA commentary on\nThe neuroscience of storing and mold-\ning tool action concepts: how “plastic” is \ngrounded cognition?\nby Mizelle, J. C., and Wheaton, L. A. (2010). \nFront. Psychology 1:195. doi: 10.3389/\nfpsyg.2010.00195\nPlasTi c or ada P Ti ve? a noTe  on \nTe\nrminology\nIn our opinion, the use of the term “plastic-\nity” is problematic because it is too generic to \nproperly account for the processes supposed \nto be involved. Plastic changes in neuronal \ncircuits can reflect either modifications of \nexisting circuits or the generation of new \ncircuits. Thus, when a new action is added \nto the sensory–motor repertoire of a given \ntool, it is not possible to demonstrate whether \nthe previous neuronal substrate changed its \nstructure or a new circuit was recruited and \nconnected to the original one. Defining the \nexact nature of this plasticity is an issue to be \naddressed in future research. From a behav-\nioral point of view, we would refer to the \ncapability of a concept to attract new motor \nmeanings as “adaptive grounded cognition, ” \nthus the higher the number of new actions \nembedded in one tool concept, the larger is \nthe number of tasks it can be recruited for.\nco mmen Ts  on ideomo To r aPr axia\nWe believe that both the “pantomime of tool \nuse” and the “selection of the tool appropri-\nate for a task” should be tested on the same \npatient to allow the model to discriminate \nbetween ideomotor and conceptual apraxia.\nAccording to the authors, a patient with \nideomotor apraxia can correctly select both \nthe tool and the usage context which are \nappropriate for a task, but is unable to trans-\nlate this knowledge into a correct complex \nmovement. Based on their model, the above \ndescribed deficit can be explained through \nimpairment of the usage context mod-\nule alone. Patients would correctly select \nthe tool because they identify it visually \nUnlike the original model, our control-\nler collects sensory–motor feedback from \nthe executed action and sends it to both the \npotential neurobiomechanics and available \ntools/usage contexts stages. The first con-\nnection allows for on-line corrections of \nthe pre-programmed movement while the \nsecond allows for action re-programming \nshould a new tool need to be employed \n(Figure 1A).\nIf no canonical tool is available, no \n stab\nle–variable affordances consistent with \n“stirring and scooping” and the temporary \ncharacteristics of the tool will be activated. \nHowever, the presence of an action goal \nto be accomplished activates the “to stir” \nusage context (bold framed action) which \nthen calls the controller to scan all available \nobjects and select an alternative with which \nthe required action can be executed.\nW e also propose more detailed selection \ncriteria. The selection of an object would \ndepend on the amount of structural, seman-\ntic, and temporary features it shares with the \nunavailable canonical tool as a function of \nthe action goal to be accomplished. Thus, \nto replace the canonical spoon or stirrer \nthe object must, for instance, have a similar \nstructure (elongated and thin), it must be \n“something that can come into contact with \nfood” and its state must be compatible with \nthe action itself (it cannot be dirty or cur-\nrently employed in an action incompatible \nwith the required action goal, e.g., spreading \nmayonnaise). If an object sufficiently matches \nthe features of the unavailable canonical tool, \nit is selected as a new tool to accomplish the \nrequired action via backward connections of \nthe controller with the available tools/usage \ncontexts stages. From the available objects \n(hammer, knife), the knife is finally selected \nand a motor program similar to that used \nfor the spoon is implemented (Figure 1B).\nIn our proposal, the controller stage is \ntherefore crucial in the motor implemen-\ntation of actions automatically afforded by \nobject perception, and of those voluntarily \nprogrammed on new tools. In the first case, \nwww.frontiersin.org A pril 2011 | V olume 2 | A rticle 53 | 1\n\nthe same action goal is repeated over time in \nthe absence of canonical tools, a new stable \naffordance will be gained by the originally \nnon-canonical tool. Nevertheless, this new \nstable functional meaning will remain sec-\nondary to the proper canonical use of the \ntool as well as context dependent.\nreferences\nBorghi, A. M., and Riggio, L. (2009).
