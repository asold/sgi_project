    "abstract": "Existing Knowledge Graph (KG) models for commonsense question answering present two challenges: (i) existing methods retrieved entities related to questions from the knowledge graph, which may extract noise and irrelevant nodes, and (ii) lack of interaction representation between questions and graph entities. However, current methods mainly focus on retrieving relevant entities with some noisy and irrelevant nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel Retrieval-augmented Knowledge Graph (RAKG) model, which solves the above issues through two key innovations. First, we leverage the density matrix to make the model reason along the corrected knowledge path and extract an enhanced knowledge graph subgraph. Second, we fuse representations of questions and graph entities through a bidirectional attention strategy, in which two representations fuse and update by Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). To evaluate the performance of our method, we conduct experiments on two widely-used benchmark datasets CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA. The case study gives insight into findings that the augmented subgraph provides reasoning along the corrected knowledge path for question answering.",
