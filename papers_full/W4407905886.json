  "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) tools, such as ChatGPT, are rapidly transforming engineering education by enhancing tasks like information retrieval, coding, and writing refinement, which are critical to the problem-solving and technical focus of engineering disciplines. This study investigates how engineering students use LLM tools and the challenges they face, offering insights into the adoption of AI technologies in academic settings. A survey of 539 engineering students from 12 leading Chinese universities, using the UTAUT framework, examines factors such as technological expectations, environmental support, and personal characteristics. The key findings include the following: (1) Over 40% of engineering students use LLM tools, with 18.8% regarding them as indispensable. (2) Trust in AI-generated content remains a central challenge, as students must critically evaluate its accuracy and reliability. (3) Environmental support significantly affects usage, with notable regional disparities, particularly between eastern and other regions in China. (4) A persistent digital divide, influenced by gender, academic level, and socioeconomic background, affects the depth and effectiveness of tool use. These results underscore the need for targeted support to address regional and demographic disparities and optimize LLM tool integration in engineering education.",
