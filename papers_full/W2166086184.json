They are also\nimportant therapeutic targets, with as many as a third of top-\nselling pharmaceutical drugs regulating their activity[1]. Improved\ntools to regulate GPCR activity are thus of great interest from both\nexperimental and therapeutic perspectives.\nOptogenetics is one of the most exciting recent technological\ndevelopments in neuroscience. In brief, cell types of interest are\nengineered to express light-sensitive proteins (photopigments),\nallowing light to be used to regulate their activity remotely and\nwith unprecedented spatial and temporal precision. The most\nwidely used photopigments in optogenetics are microbial light-\ngated ion channels, which have been extensively exploited to allow\ndirect control of neuronal membrane potential (e.g. [2,3,4] for\nreviews). More recently, attention has turned to non-excitable\ncells, and to photopigments capable of regulating cellular systems\nother than ionic permeability.\nThe opsin photopigments that support vision across the animal\nkingdom are GPCRs whose signalling activity is regulated by light.\nThey thus represent natural candidates for optogenetic control of\nG-protein signalling.Drosophila Rh1 and, more recently, mamma-\nlian melanopsin have been used to provide photic control of Gaq\nsignalling [5,6]. However, the most flexible tools in this area have\nbeen based upon rod opsin, the photopigment of vertebrate rods.\nRod opsin’s cognate G-protein is transducin, a member of the Gai\nsubclass, and it has been exploited to regulate Gai signalling for\nexperimental purposes [7,8]. However, thanks to the extensive\nstructural information available for this protein, chimeric receptors\n(recently termed OptoXRs) comprising the light sensitive elements\nof rod opsin fused to intracellular signalling components of other\nGPCRs have been used to gain access also to the third major class\nof G protein, Gas [9,10].\nRod opsin has many advantages as a starting point for designing\noptogenetic tools: 1.) It expresses efficiently in non-native en-\nvironments without adding specialist chaperones/folding factors.\n2.) Its signalling characteristics are well described and specific\n[11,12]. 3.) Its basic structure is well-defined, as are many\nstructure:function relationships [13,14,15,16], facilitating the\ndesign of chimera and site-directed mutants aimed at optimising\nits use for particular cell types and modifying its signalling activity.\nHowever, it has one potentially important limitation - its reliance\nupon cis-isoforms of retinaldehyde to recover from bleach. In the\nvertebrate retina an enzymatic pathway ensures a steady supply of\nsuch cis-isoforms, but this pathway is absent elsewhere in the\nmammalian body. It seems likely then that the availability ofcis-\nretinaldehyde would limit the magnitude of rod-opsin driven\nresponses outside of the eye. Moreover, while application of\nexogenous cis-isoforms could alleviate this problem, the effect of\nsuch an approach should steadily decrease during light exposure as\ncis-isoforms are degraded. Previous analyses of OptoXRs have not\nprobed this behaviour because they have relied upon either end-\npoint assays of second messenger or single stimulation protocols\n[7,10]. Here, using a real time reporter for cAMP, we present\nevidence that pigment bleach does indeed impose a fundamental\nlimit on the magnitude and reproducibility of rod opsin-based\nOptoXR activity.\nMany opsins from invertebrates (and a very few from\nvertebrates) do not bleach like rod opsin. These so-called bistable\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e30774\npigments bind bothcis- and trans- isoforms of retinaldehyde, with\nlight driving isomerisation in both directions. This comprises an\nintrinsic bleach recovery mechanism that makes bistable pigments\nmuch less reliant upon a supply ofcis-retinaldehydes. Such bistable\npigments could therefore provide improved tools for optogenetic\ncontrol, allowing higher amplitude and more reproducible light\nresponses. Here we show that a bleach-resistant opsin from the\nbox jellyfish, Carybdea rastonii, previously shown to be naturally\nGas-coupled [17], does indeed allow much superior control of G\nprotein signalling. The light dependent increase in cAMP induced\nby this ‘JellyOp’ is both higher amplitude and, especially, more\nrepeatable than the response driven by currently available\nOptoXRs. As we also show that JellyOp responds to modest\nlevels of visible light it represents an accessible tool for optogenetic\ncontrol of GPCR signalling.\nMethods\nConstruction of receptors\nConstruction of chimeric receptors was carried out following\nthe optimal cytoplasmic boundaries described by Kim et al\n(2005)[9]. Our version of the ‘standard’ receptor [9,10] was\ndesigned from human rhodopsin and b2AR sequences (Gen-\nbank NM_000539.3 and NM_000024, respectively; Figure 1) to\nmaximise any future therapeutic potential of the protein. The\nsequence also included silent substitutions to introduce unique\nrestriction enzyme recognition sites within each transmembrane\nregion to facilitate cloning diff erent cytoplasmic loops. The\nnucleotide sequence for Rh1b2AR 1-t with silent substitutions\nwas synthesised by Genscrip tC o r pa n ds u p p l i e di np u c 5 7\ncloning vector. A phosphorylation mutant (Rh1b2AR 1-t phos\nmutant) was engineered by exchanging serine residues (7 in\ntotal; 261, 262, 345, 346, 355, 356, 364 based on the numbering\nof residues of the humanb2AR) known to be important for PKA\nand GRK phosphorylation for alanine (following [18]), using\nsite directed mutagenesis (lightning quikchange kit; Stratagene).\nIn addition, a mutant was created from the standard Rh1b2AR\n1-t (termed Rh1b2AR 1-t::Gas) with the stop codon replaced\nwith a 6-base linker and the coding region for a ‘short’ transcript\nof the human Gas protein (Figure 1). The transcript on which\nthe coding region for G as was based (GNASS; Genbank\nNM_080426.2) has been shown to have less constitutive activity\nthan longer forms [19]. A 1D4 epitope was fused at the 39 end of\nevery receptor construct coding region, composed of the last 9\namino acid codons from bovine rhodopsin followed by a stop\ncodon. All sequences were verified via standard sequencing\ntechniques prior to use. The coding regions of the receptors\nused were flanked by HindIII and NotI sequences and cloned\ninto the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. The\nsequence for the opsin of the box jellyfish Carybdea rastonii\n(Genbank AB435549; JellyOp) w as also synthesised by Gen-\nscript Corp in a puc57 vector and fused with a 1D4 epitope. An\nHpaI recognition site was introduced into the multiple cloning\nsite of the pcDNA3.1 vector and the jellyfish sequence flanked\nwith HpaI and NotI sites for cloning into pcDNA3.1-HpaI. A\njellyfish lysine mutant plasmid was also engineered using site\ndirected mutagenesis to alter thep u t a t i v ec h r o m o p h o r eb i n d i n g\nsite at residue 296 from lysine to alanine (numbering from\nbovine rhodopsin [14]).\ncAMP reporter\nA HEK293 cell line expressing the Glosensor TM cAMP\nbiosensor under a tetracycline inducible promoter (FLP-IN TM\nsystem, Invitrogen; Glosensor, Promega; [20]) was generated. This\nbiosensor is a modified luciferase that carries the cAMP binding B\ndomain from the RIIb subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase\nA (PKA). The Glosensor TM region was excised from the\npGlosensor plasmid (Promega) and cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/\nTO, then co-transfected with pOG44 into FLP-IN\nTM-293 cells.\nIsogenic stable cell lines were selected and maintained with\n100\nmg/ml hygromycin and 10 mg/ml blasticidin. Cells were\nmaintained at 37 uC in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium\n(DMEM), 4,500 mg/ml D-glucose, sodium pyruvate and L-\nglutamine (Sigma) with 10% foetal bovine serum (Sigma) in a\n5% CO\n2 atmosphere. Following incubation with 300 ng/ml\ntetracycline, these cells showed repeatable and robust increases\nin raw luminescence (RLU) when stimulated with a range of\nforskolin concentrations (Figure 2).\nThe reporter was validated by determining the effect of known\ndoses of forskolin on levels of cAMP, determined by ELISA and\nGlosensor bioluminescence, without any addition of phosphodies-\nterase inhibitors. Dose response curves of forskolin could be fit by\nboth methods by sigmoidal dose response curves of the form y = a\n+ b/1+10\n(c-x) where a = bottom, b = top-bottom and c = Lo-\ngEC50, and yield EC50 values of 51 and 21mM for ELISA and\nluminescence assays respectively, confirming the sensitivity of the\nbioassay. The relationship between cAMP and Glosensor response\ncould then be inferred and fit by a first order polynomial (R\n2 value\nof 0.999), suggesting that, under these conditions, cAMP\nconcentration can therefore be estimated from RLU as follows:\n[cAMP]\nmM = 4.785+ (0.0003971a) + (0.000005261aˆ2)\nwhere a = RLU/ml.\nLight response assays\n7.5 x 103 FLP-INTM-293 Glosensor cells in each well of solid\nwhite 96 well plates were transfected with plasmids containing\nopsin based receptors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in\nserum-free medium for 6 hours. Immunocytochemistry revealed\na transfection efficiency of ,50% using this method. A stable\ncell line was constructed using a linearised plasmid of pcDNA3-\nHpaI JellyOp and additionally maintained with 400\nmg/ml\nG418. Following transfection (or plating for the stable line), cells\nwere then incubated for 16 hours with 300 ng/ml tetracycline\nand 10 mM retinaldehyde (9- cis retinal or all -trans retinal;\nSigma-Aldrich) in CO 2 independent mediu m without phenol\nred (L-15, Invitrogen), wit h 10% FCS. Beetle luciferin\npotassium salt (Promega) reconstituted in 10mM HEPES buffer\nwas added to a final concentration of 2mM luciferin. All\nprocedures following transfection of cells with opsins were\ncarried out in dim red light.\nRaw luminescence units (RLU) in cells were recorded at 37uC\nwith 1s resolution with a top-read 3mm lens in a Fluostar Optima\nplate reader (BMG Labtech), with cycles of either 30s or 60s and\ngain of 3600. Following 30 mins equilibration, cells were subjected\nto repeated flashes from an electronic camera flash (The Jessop\nGroup Ltd, UK; or forskolin application for cAMP biosensor\nvalidation) followed by recovery periods where RLU was\nrecorded. Luminescence recordings were analysed with Optima\n(BMG Labtech) software and Microsoft Office Xcel. All\nexperiments comprised cells plated and treated in triplicate. The\naverage triplicate value for the five minutes prior to light treatment\nwas used to normalise individual well values of the triplicate that\nwere then averaged, except where baseline levels were examined.\nIn the latter case, individual values were normalised to the\ntriplicate average baseline RLU readings for mock transfected\ncells. Prism (Graphpad) software was used for all statistical\nanalyses.\nRegulation of cAMP Using a Metazoan Opsin\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e30774\nRegulation of cAMP Using a Metazoan Opsin\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e30774\nLight response assays of stably expressing FLP-INTM-293\nGlosensor JellyOp cells\n7.56104 FLP-INTM-293 Glosensor JellyOp cells in each well of\nsolid white 96 well plates were incubated with tetracycline and\nretinaldehyde as for temporal responses resulting from transient\ntransfections above. In addition, for one experiment, 4 x 10\n4 FLP-\nINTM-293 Glosensor JellyOp cells were plated per well following\npre-coating the wells with 0.01% poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) in\nPBS for 2 hours. Cells were incubated as before and then treated\nwith vehicle or 100\nmM MDL2330A (Tocris Bioscience) for 15\nmins before luminescence recordings as above.\nAn irradiance response curve was created for stable JellyOp\nexpressing cells as follows. Cells were exposed to 10s of light from\nan array of white LEDs (Low energy floodlight, Palmer Riley\nElectricals UK) covered with layers of neutral density filter (Lee\nFilters, UK). Cells were left to recover and luminescence measured\nfor 15 minutes and then exposed to a further light pulse brighter\nby 1 log unit, and this was repeated up to an irradiance of\n4.66 mW cm\n22. Spectral irradiance was measured with a\nspectroradiometer (Bentham Scientific).\nImmunocytochemistry\n3.5 x 105 cells/ml FLP-IN Glosensor cells were seeded onto\ncoverslips and transfected with receptor constructs as above. 3.5 x\n10\n5 cells/ml FLP-IN Glosensor JellyOp cells were seeded onto\ncoverslips in red light. Following transfections, cells for MAPK\nFigure 2. Validating the cAMP biosensor.A HEK293 cell line expressing the GlosensorTM cAMP biosensor under a tetracycline inducible\npromoter (FLP-INTM system; Invitrogen) was generated. The reporter was validated by determining the effect of known doses of forskolin on levels of\ncAMP, determined by ELISA (a) and Glosensor bioluminescence (b). Data show mean for 2 (ELISA) and 3 (luminescence) separate experiments each of\nwhich contained samples in triplicate.

(c) A comparison of cAMP concentration and\nRLU for each forskolin concentration was used to infer the relationship between these parameters. This could be fit by a first order polynomial (R2\nvalue of 0.999), suggesting that, under these conditions, cAMP concentration can therefore be estimated from RLU as follows: [cAMP]mM = 4.785+\n(0.0003971a) + (0.000005261aˆ2) where a = RLU/ml.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030774.g002\nFigure 1. OptoXR sequence alignment.A number of structural variants on a published OptoXR chimera comprising elements of the human\nb2AR and human rhodopsin sequences were generated in an attempt to increase response amplitude/reproducibility. An amino acid alignment of\nthese variants and, for comparison the humanb2AR and rhodopsin (Genbank NM_000539.3, in red and NM_000024, in black), and JellyOp (Genbank\nAB435549, in blue) sequences are shown.

Note that the terminal 9\namino acids of rod opsin are included as an epitope tag (1D4) in all receptors used in this study (light grey shading). In addition to the published\nOptoXR in which the entire cytoplasmic surface of rod opsin is replaced by that of theb2AR (Rh1B2AR 1-t), variants in which either 1\nst or 1st and 2nd\nintracellular loops from rod opsin were retained (Rh1B2AR 2-t and Rh1B2AR C3,t) in the hope of improving chimera stability were generated. Other\nvariants on Rh1B2AR 1-t employed site directed mutagenesis of phosphorylation sites (highlighted in red) important for arrestin binding and receptor\ninactivation [18] (Rh1B2AR 1-t phos mutant) or a fusion of the human Gas subunit at the C-terminal tail in purple (Rh1B2AR 1-t::Gas).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030774.g001\nRegulation of cAMP Using a Metazoan Opsin\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e30774\nlabelling were incubated for 16 hours with 9-cis retinal in L-15\nmedium with 0.5% FCS and no phenol red.

Phospho-MAPK labelled cells were\nincubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody and ABC\nstreptavidin (Vectalabs) complex and developed with a DAB/\nNickel chloride kit (Vectalabs). 1D4 labelling was visualised with\nAlexa555-conjugated secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molec-\nular Probes) at 1:1000 and cells were mounted with Vectashield\nwith DAPI (Vectalabs).

Fluorescent images were taken on a Nikon\nEclipse upright 90i confocal microscope using 405nm and 543nm\nlaser lines.\nResults\nOptoXR-driven responses have poor reproducibility\nMeasuring light-dependent cAMP accumulation in optogenetic\nstudies presents a technological challenge. Standard end-point\nassays fail to capture one of the essential features of optogenetics,\nthe ability for repeated and temporally defined activation.\nHowever, real-time assays based upon fluorescent calcium\nreporters or FRET reporters, which are now in standard use to\nmeasure cAMP [21,22,23,24], are inappropriate because the\nexcitation light for the fluorescence reporter will likely also activate\nthe optogenetic photopigment. Here, we hoped to avoid these\nlimitations by using a luciferase-based cAMP reporter, to provide a\nlive-cell readout of this second messenger without impacting\nreceptor activity (Figure 2, Figure, 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). We\nstarted by transiently transfecting HEK 293 cells carrying this\nreporter with a humanised version of a published OptoXR,\ncomprising the trans-membrane and extracellular elements of rod\nopsin fused to the intracellular components of theb2-adrenergic\nreceptor (termed here Rh1B2AR 1-t; Figure 1). When these cells\nhad been pre-incubated with 9-cis retinal, a single brief flash of\nlight induced a rapid and reversible increase in luminescence\n(Figure 3). The magnitude of this response was robust. Thus, at its\npeak there was a 3.07 60.2 (mean 6 SEM) fold increase in\nluminescence over background. We estimate a transfection\nefficiency of ,50% from immunocytochemistry (see Methods;\nLight response assays). Using the formula derived from the\nrelationship between Glosensor RLU responses to forskolin and\nmeasured cAMP values stimulated by forskolin, the peak cAMP\nlight response by the Rh1B2AR 1-t receptor if transfection\nefficiency is corrected to 100% was,5.15\nmM. This compares to\naround 7.27mM cAMP produced in response to 1mM forskolin or\n18.48 mM cAMP produced in response to 10mM forskolin in these\ncells. Rh1B2AR 1-t expressing cells pre-incubated with all-trans\nretinaldehyde did also show a light response (presumably because\nthe HEK 293 cell line, unlike primary kidney cells, expresses\nRPE65 allowing it to generate cis-isoforms of retinaldehyde\n[25,26]), but the associated increase in luminescence was much\nsmaller than in the 9-cis retinaldyehyde condition (Figure 3).\nThe potentiating effect of exogenous 9-cis retinaldehyde on the\nOptoXR light response is consistent with the known dependence\nof rod opsin on cis-isoforms of retinaldehyde. On this basis,\nhowever, the effect is predicted not to survive repeated light\nexposure. This indeed was the case. We found that the light\nresponse of cells expressing the published Rh1B2AR 1-t rapidly\ndiminished under these conditions. Thus, the peak response\namplitude to a second brief flash was reduced by about 50%, with\nsubsequent responses further diminished. Indeed, by the 5th flash,\nresponses were very small, indicating that the potentiating effect of\nthe exogenous cis-retinaldehyde had been largely lost (Figure 3).\nWe generated a panel of structural variants of the Rh1B2AR\nchimera in an attempt to improve the magnitude of the OptoXR\nresponse. We aimed to obtain a reasonable response amplitude\neven in the absence ofcis-retinaldehdyes and/or under repeated\nlight exposure (Figure 4).

This is significantly greater than the best response\nwe achieved with Rh1-based OptoXRs (from Rh1B2AR 2-t;\np,0.05 one tailed t-test). Interestingly, the kinetics of the JellyOp\nresponse were also increased, with a sharper decline in\nluminescence suggesting that this receptor may allow finer\ntemporal control of the second messenger. The real advantage\nof using JellyOp was, however, in the response to repeated\nstimulation. Thus, JellyOp-driven responses to subsequent flashes\nwere only modestly reduced, and a series of 5 flashes maintained\ncAMP at a much higher level than that obtainable with OptoXRs\n(one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-hoc test, p ,0.01;\nFigure 5d). The implication that JellyOp is able to support high\namplitude cAMP responses without exogenous cis-retinaldehyde\nwas confirmed by the activity of cells pre-incubated with all-trans\nretinal (Figure 5c). In these cells, response amplitude showed no\nsign of decreasing under repeated stimulation and, if anything,\nincreased. Similarly, the JellyOp response under these conditions\nwas much greater than that of OptoXRs (one-way ANOVA with\nDunnett’s post-hoc test, p,0.001, Figure 5e).\nBasal levels of luminescence were modestly increased in cells\nexpressing JellyOp. Thus, cells preincubated with 9-cis retinalde-\nhyde had 1.2160.1 times greater luminescence in the dark than\nuntransfected controls, and 1.8160.16 times greater luminescence\nwith all-trans retinaldehyde. This likely represents genuine basal\n(dark) activity of the receptor, although given the high photosen-\nsitivity of JellyOp (see below), light produced by the luciferase\nreporter may also have driven some receptor photoactivation.\nJellyOp sensory characteristics\nIn order to further characterise the sensory characteristics of\nJellyOp in HEK293 cells, we generated a cell line stably expressing\nthis opsin. The first notable feature of this cell line was the\nmagnitude of light responses. We found that a single brief light\npulse could increase luminescence by 24.4762.22 (n = 5) fold in\ncells pre-incubated with 9- cis retinaldehyde (approx. 7.63\nmM\ncAMP). Moreover, we were able to maintain this level of reporter\nactivity for at least 15 mins with repeated stimulation (Figure 5f).\nConsistent with the view that JellyOp-dependent increases in\nluminescence reflect opsin-based activation of adenylate cyclase\nactivity via a Gas cascade, we found that the light response of\nthese cells was repressed by an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor\n(MDL2300A) and absent when a JellyOp mutant lacking the\nlysine critical for chromophore binding was used (Figure 5g,h).\nTreatment with inhibitors of canonical Gi or Gq cascades\n(pertussis toxin, a Gi inhibitor or U73122, a PLC inhibitor),\nhowever, did not have an effect on the light response (data not\nshown).\nThe most commonly used optogenetic tools require very bright\nlight for activation [10,27,28]. We next determined whether this\nwas also true for JellyOp by describing the irradiance dependence\nof the cAMP response in the stable cell line. We found a\nmeasurable increase in luminescence could be induced by 10s\npulses of white light (LED source) at irradiances $1\nmW/cm2\n(Figure 5i). For reference, light levels at bench-top in our\nlaboratory are typically around 200mW/cm2. In fact this likely\noverestimates the light required to activate JellyOp because much\nof the energy produced by the white LED will be inefficiently\nabsorbed by the pigment. JellyOp is maximally sensitive to light of\naround 500nm in wavelength [17], and we estimate that responses\ncould be elicited by as little as 11 log photons/cm\n2/s (,100 nW/\ncm2) if a 500nm narrow band light source were employed. The\nincrease in reporter luminescence at these threshold irradiances\ncorresponds to that induced by around 1\nmM forskolin.\nLight dependent mitogen activated protein kinase\n(MAPK) signalling\nGPCR signalling is not restricted to conventional Ga/second\nmessenger pathways but may also involve Gbc and G-protein\nindependent ( b-arrestin) pathways that can lead to MAPK\nphosphorylation and activation of other cascades, typically\nfollowing a longer time course than the conventional pathways\n[29]. We found that both JellyOp and all of the OptoXRs used in\nthis study drove a light dependent increase in MAPK phosphor-\nylation in HEK293 cells (Figure 6). Thus, there was a marked\nincrease in immunoreactivity for phospho-MAPK, following 2 or\n15 minutes exposure to a white LED based light source\n(Litebook\nTM; 2.6 mW cm22) in HEK293 FLP-IN Glosensor cells\ntransiently expressing any of these receptors. In agreement with\ndata from cAMP Glosensor recordings, treatment of cells\nexpressing JellyOp with inhibitors of canonical Gi or Gq cascades\n(pertussis toxin or U73122) did not result in measurable reduction\nof MAPK phosphorylation following light treatment. Conversely,\ntreatment with an adenylate cyclase inhibitor inhibited MAPK\nphosphorylation at both shorter and longer (15 mins) time points.\nThis indicates that MAPK phosphorylation under these conditions\nis downstream of an increase in cAMP rather than attributed to G\nprotein independent pathways following light activation.\nDiscussion\nThe conventional approach to manipulating GPCR activity is\npharmaceutical. However, drugs have a number of well-recog-\nnised limitations. Off-target effects on tissues and cell types other\nFigure 5.

Optogenetics provides an exciting opportunity to\novercome these problems by using a ‘ligand’ (light), which can be\napplied with mm/msec spatiotemporal resolution, to activate a\nreceptor targeted to specific cell types using the tools of genetic\nengineering. The ultimate expression of this technology will be to\nimpose natural patterns of GPCR activity. Realising this\nambition will, however, require optogenetic tools that allow both\nrepeatable and sustained activation. There is abundant evidence\nthat this level of control is physiologically relevant. Thus, cAMP\nsignalling in units as small as sub-cellular compartments has been\ndescribed [30,31,32], while pulsatile and oscillatory patterns of\ncAMP concentration are common and can elicit different\ndownstream responses than continuous cAMP elevations\n[22,33,34,35]. The data presented here suggests that this is\nachievable using JellyOp, a bleach resistant visual opsin from the\nbox jellyfish Carybdea rastonii.\nOptogenetic control of G as signalling has previously been\nachieved using chimeric receptors comprising light absorbing\nelements of mammalian rod opsin and G-protein interaction\ndomains from other GPCRs [9,10]. Such OptoXRs have been\nused successfully to regulate cAMP and Ca2+ in vitro and in vivo,\nbut the reproducibility and sustainability of activation have not\nbeen rigorously interrogated. Here we first set out to achieve this\nusing a new luciferase-based cAMP biosensor to track live cell\nresponses driven by OptoXRs. Our data reveal intrinsic\nlimitations to the currently available rhodopsin/ b2 adrenergic\nreceptor chimera (Rh1B2AR 1-t). Thus, although light drove a\nclear induction of cAMP in HEK293 cells expressing this receptor,\nresponses were low amplitude without preincubation with cis-\nretinaldehyde. We were able to achieve modest improvements in\nthis aspect of performance by changing chimera design. However,\nthe more important deficit was in response reproducibility, and\nnone of our revised OptoXRs were able to recover the precipitous\ndecline in response amplitude over repeated stimulation. This\naspect of OptoXR behaviour is predicted by the bleaching\ncharacteristics of rod opsin, which requires a ready supply ofcis-\nretinaldehyde to remain photosensitive in its native environment.\nAs the enzymatic machinery required to generate large amounts of\ncis-retinaldehyde is restricted to the eye in mammals, this could be\nan important limitation to optogenetic application. Some\nresearchers have applied exogenouscis-retinaldehyde when using\nrod opsin-based tools for optogenetic control [7]. Our data suggest\nthat this represents only a partial solution to the problem, as its\neffectiveness should rapidly decline under repeated or continuous\nlight exposure.\nOur data suggest that JellyOp overcomes these critical\nlimitations to allow reproducible and sustained cAMP responses.\nThese features are consistent with published evidence that\nJellyOp is intrinsically bleach-r esistant. Many animal opsins\nhave two photo-interconvertible stable states binding either cis-\nor trans-isoforms of retinaldehyde. This enables them to remain\nphotosensitive under repeated/continuous light exposure. The\nphotobiology of JellyOp is in completely understood, but\nKoyanagi et al (2008 [17]) were able to show that when\npurified JellyOp was reconstituted with 11- cis retinaldehyde,\nlight exposure led to creation of a thermostable pigment binding\nall-trans retinaldehyde and absorbin g visible wavelengths. In\norder to be fully bleach resistant, further light exposure should\nreconstitute the 11-cis isoform. Koyanagi et al (2008 [17]) did\nFigure 6. MAPK phosphorylation.

(a) OptoXRs elicit a light dependent increase in MAPK phosphorylation. Photomicrographs for untransfected cells and cells expressing each of\nthe OptoXRs were taken with the same exposure settings. Scale bar = 50mm. (b) Phosphorylated MAPK in HEK293 cells expressing JellyOp exposed\nto the dark or 15 mins of light. Cells labelled ‘+PTX’ were treated with 100ng/ml pertussis toxin (a Gi inhibitor); ‘+U73122’ with 10mM U73122 (a Gq\ninhibitor); ‘+MDL2330A’ with 100mM (adenylate cyclase inhibitor). MDL inhibits light-induced MAPK phosphorylation following both 2 mins (not\nshown) and 15 mins of light. The increase in phosphorylation therefore appears to be due to a Gs dependent pathway.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0030774.g006\nRegulation of cAMP Using a Metazoan Opsin\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 January 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | e30774\nn o tr e p o r tt h i sf i n a ls t e pi nb l e ach recovery for JellyOp, but this\nmay be due to inadequacies in the in vitro environment. Our\ndata support that view. The relatively poor performance of our\nrod-opsin based OptoXRs except in the presence of exogenous\ncis-retinaldehdye highlights how important such bleach-resis-\ntance is likely to be forin vivo application. A new generation of\noptogenetic tools based upon ble ach-resistant animal opsins\ncould then be contemplated.\nJellyOp is the only animal opsin known to be Gas coupled. This\nhas enabled us to use it to achieve control of G as signalling\nwithout OptoXR-like modifications of putative G-protein inter-\naction domains. Nevertheless, future work could usefully concen-\ntrate on structural modifications to the receptor. The intracellular\nsurface of GPCRs is responsible not only for defining G-protein\nspecificity, but also for targeting the receptor to specific cellular\ncompartments; defining the rate of receptor deactivation; and\ncoupling to non-canonical signalling pathways. It should therefore\nbe possible in future to adjust these aspects of JellyOp activity by\nchanging its intracellular domains. This potential to approximate\nmultiple aspects of native GPCR activity sets JellyOp aside from\nother approaches directly targeting cAMP production. A group of\nmicrobial photoactivated adenylate cyclases (PACs) have been\nused to achieve this latter goal [28,36,37,38], although it is not yet\nclear whether these PACs approach the repeatability/sustainabil-\nity of JellyOp signalling.\nOne most notable feature of JellyOp is its high sensitivity. We\nachieved pharmacological levels of cAMP induction with a white\nlight stimulus as low as 1\nmW/cm2. This is many orders of\nmagnitude below that required to activate the microbial light\ngated ion channels used so widely in neuroscience [27] and at least\n10x below the threshold for the most sensitive currently available\noptogenetic tools [38,39,40]. As this means that JellyOp can be\nactivated using simple, inexpensive, white light sources, it makes it\na very accessible technology.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Laura Collins and Christoph Gru¨n for\ntechnical assistance.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: HJB RJL.
