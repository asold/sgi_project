  "abstract": "It is a fact that the frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) curve at different temperatures can be corrected by the shift factor (αT) extracted from the master curve. However, the αT and master curve reported by previous works are distinctive due to the difference in the construction algorithm. Therefore, it is of great significance to report a universal approach for extracting αT. In this work, the unaged oil-immersed pressboards with different moisture content (mc%) are firstly prepared and selected as the research specimen. Then, the αT of FDS curves on the above pressboard is extracted based upon the master curve technique. The influence mechanism under the various test temperature (T) and mc% is therefore analyzed so as to establish a universal model for predicting the αT. The present findings reveal that the αT value extracted from FDS curves is both temperature-dependent and moisture-dependent. In addition, the predicted αT is not only suitable for temperature correction on FDS curve of same type pressboard with different insulation conditions (moisture contents and aging degrees), but also maintains considerable accuracy when applied to different types of pressboard. Therefore, the obtained conclusions will provide a universal method for temperature correction on FDS curve of transformer polymer insulation.",
