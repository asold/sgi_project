Finally , the effectiveness of the proposed LVRT strategy is\nverified by simulation model.\nKeywords: Power electronic transformer, Low-voltage ride th rough, Control strategy, Current instruction value\n1 Introduction\nWith the increase of grid-connected capacity of distrib-\nuted energy and the growth of the demand for ‘plug and\nplay’ of user-side load, DC power distribution technology\nhas been gradually applied for pilot applications due to\nits outstanding power supply capability, strong control-\nlability and good load compatibility [ 1, 2]. And trad-\nitional AC distribution network is developing towards\nAC/DC hybrid distribution network. As a key equipment\nin AC/DC hybrid distribution network, power electronic\ntransformer(PET) bears many tasks such as AC/DC\nsystem interconnection, voltage level conversion, power\nflow control, power quality adjustment, reactive power\ncompensation and so on [ 3–5], the operating perform-\nance of which has a vital impact on the safe and stable\noperation of the power grid.\nIn the AC/DC hybrid distribution network, the main\npower supply is generally an AC power supply. When\nthe AC grid is short-circuited and the voltage sags, the\nPET should realize LVRT without off-grid to improve\nthe stability of the grid operation and the reliability of\nthe power supply. At present, there are a lot of\nresearches on the normal operation control strategy of\nPET [ 6–9]. However, there are relatively few studies on\nLVRT strategies. In [ 10], aiming at the asymmetric\nshort-circuit fault on AC side, the negative sequence\nvoltage injection method is proposed to realize the DC\nvoltage equalization between the bridge arms, but this\nmeasure will inject negative sequence current into the\ngrid, which will adversely affect the operation of elec-\ntrical equipment. In [ 11], the zero sequence voltage\ninjection method is used for DC voltage equalization\ncontrol, and the negative sequence current suppression\nis used to reduce the negative sequence current. How-\never, the double-loop control is still used during the\nLVRT, which slows down the system adjustment speed\nand affect the negative sequence current suppression\neffect. Reference [ 12] proposed a LVRT strategy for a\ncascaded H-bridge centralized photovoltaic grid-\nconnected device, which injected reactive power into the\ngrid during voltage sags, but the PV grid-connected\ndevice is a power unidirectional transmission device, for\nwhich this strategy does not accommodate power bidir-\nectional transmission conditions.\nAccording to the structural characteristics of PET, a\nLVRT strategy suitable for bidirectional power exchange\nof PET is proposed for the purpose of maintaining\nsystem stability, assisting system voltage recovery and\n© The Author(s). 2019 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.\n* Correspondence: hanjiexiang@hust.edu.cn\n1State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and\nTechnology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan\n430074, Hubei, China\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nProtection and Control of\nModern Power Systems\nHan et al.

The good performance\nof the proposed LVRT strategy is verified by the simula-\ntion results.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Topology of PET\nPET can be divided into AC/AC type and AC/DC/AC\ntype according to whether the intermediate conversion\nmodule has DC link. The latter has become the research\nfocus because of its good controllability and high flexi-\nbility. AC/DC/AC type PET includes two basic structural\nforms: cascaded H-bridge type and Modular Multilevel\nConverter(MMC) type [ 5, 13]. Cascaded H-bridge PET\nhas advantages of higher power density, and there is no\nbridge arm circulating current when three-phase star\nconnection is connected, for which its research and\napplication have received extensive attention. This paper\nwill focus on the engineering practice and the LVRT\nstrategy of cascaded H-bridge PET.\nThe basic structure of the cascaded H-bridge four-port\nPET is shown in Fig. 1. The ports are AC 10 kV, DC ±\n750 V, AC 380 V and DC ±375 V respectively.\nThe AC-DC module in Fig. 1 implements the power\nconversion between AC10kV and DC ± 750 V, which is a\nkey component and bear the main function of the PET.\nThe AC-DC module shown in Fig. 2(a) consists of two\nidentical star cascaded units shown in Fig. 2(b). Two\nAC-DC converters of the same structure can realize DC\nbipolar output by symmetrical connection. Because the\npositive and negative poles of the bipolar AC-DC con-\nverter have the same topological structure, in this paper,\nthe single-pole structure converter shown in Fig. 2(b) is\nstudied, and the control strategy of the other pole is\nidentical.\nOne of the main problems that need to be solved in\nthe practical application of cascaded H-bridge PET is\nhow to achieve the equalization of the three-phase DC\nvoltage when asymmetric voltage sags occur in the\npower grid to ensure the safe operation of the converter.\nReferences [ 11, 12] proposes the use of zero sequence or\nnegative sequence voltage injection strategies to achieve\nDC voltage equalization control, but it will lead to con-\ntrol complexity, and the time-delay effect of the control\nstrategy will affect the equalization effect. In view of the\nabove problems, this paper realizes the self-balancing of\nDC voltage between bridge arms through the\noptimization design of DC link topology, which is shown\nin Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 3. In Fig. 2(b), the sub-module of\nthe cascaded bridge arm adopts a typical cascaded H-\nbridge structure on the AC side, and on the DC side all\nthe three-phase sub-modules are uniformly connected in\nparallel to form a DC port; In Fig. 3, the sub-module of\nAC-DC module uses a resonant bidirectional DC-DC\nconverter, and the double-sided H-bridge is connected\nthrough a high-frequency transformer with a resonant\ncapacitor to achieve voltage level conversion and elec-\ntrical isolation. The H-bridge on both sides modulate\nthe DC voltage into a high-frequency square wave, and\nthe power exchange is realized through the resonance\nlink. When the operating frequency is near the resonant\nfrequency, the DC-DC ratio of the converter is equal to\nthe high-frequency transformer ratio, and the perform-\nance of the converter is stable, and the load capacity of\nthe converter is strong [ 14, 15].\nAs shown in Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 3, the DC side adopts a\nunified parallel port, combined with the superior per-\nformance DC-DC converter, can realize the self-\nbalancing of the sub-module voltage; the AC side adopts\nthe series structure, which can ensure the input current\nof the sub-module is consistent, so the PET can realize\nthe sub-module voltage and current self-balancing to\nachieve balanced distribution of power between sub-\nmodules. The relationship between the AC side current,\nthe DC side voltage and the submodule voltage and\ncurrent can be obtained as shown in (1).\nudc1k1 ¼ udc1k2 ¼ ⋯ ¼ udc1kN ¼ Udc=nT\niink1 ¼ iink2 ¼ ⋯ ¼ iinkN ¼ ik\n/C26\nð1Þ\nWhere k = a, b,o r c is the phase of AC side, udc1 is\nDC-DC converter primary side voltage, Udc is DC port\nvoltage, nT is the high frequency transformer ratio, ik is\nac side current and iin is input current of submodule.\nTherefore, adopting the above topology structure,\nwhen an asymmetric voltage sag occurs on the AC side,\nthe DC side parallel modules can realize current self-\nbalancing, thereby realizing the AC side series modules\nvoltage self-balancing. Thus, there is no need to add the\nDC voltage balance control link, for which the device\noperating performance can be improved and the control\nsystem can be simplified.\nFig. 1 PET overall structure\nHan et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:20 Page 2 of 12\n2.2 LVRT strategy of PET\n2.2.1 Control objectives of LVRT\nAC-DC module of PET generally uses a dual closed-loop\ncontrol strategy during normal operation, as shown in\nFig. 4. According to the working conditions and control\nobjectives of PET, the outer loop can be controlled by\nconstant DC voltage or constant power respectively, the\nadjustment time of which is generally 40~100 ms. The\ncurrent inner loop adopts the d-axis voltage-oriented\nfeedforward decoupling control strategy to quickly track\nthe d-axis and q-axis current instruction values gener-\nated by the outer loop controller to improve the control\nperformance, and the tracking time is 2~5 ms.\nIn the case of AC power grid failure causing AC bus\nvoltage drop, PET operating in constant voltage mode\ncan transfer voltage control function to other equip-\nment, thus the DC voltage can be maintained during the\nlow voltage ride through operation, then blocking volt-\nage and reactive power outer loop. When the DC bus\nvoltage is controlled by other equipment such as energy\nstorage systems, PET can work in constant power\ncontrol mode and can directly block the outer power\nloop. Thus, the current inner loop is directly used for\ncontrol during the LVRT operation to improve the over-\nall response speed by blocking the outer loop of the\ncontroller.\nFig. 2 PET pre-stage AC-DC module topology. a Bipolar AC-DC module. b Single-pole structure\nFig. 3 PET cascaded unit sub-module topology\nHan et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:20 Page 3 of 12\nWhen the AC grid is short-circuited and the voltage\nsags, the PET should realize LVRT without off-grid to\nimprove the stability of the grid operation and the reli-\nability of the power supply. At present, there are few re-\nsearches on PET LVRT control strategies, and this paper\nattempts to make up for this deficiency. PET is intercon-\nnected with the AC grid via an inverter, which is similar\nto photovoltaic power and direct drive wind turbine.\nTherefore, their LVRT control targets also have similar-\nities for the purposes of ensuring the safe operation of\nthe inverter and maintaining the stability of grid. In the\ndesign of the LVRT strategy of this paper, the relatively\nmature LVRT methods of renewable energies are used\nfor reference. The main difference between PET LVRT\ncontrol and renewable energies is that the power trans-\nmission direction of the later is one-way, while PET acts\nas a substation device with active power, for which the\npower bidirectional transmission characteristics need to\nbe considered and special treatment is required in the\ngiven algorithm of the active current instruction value in\nPET LVRT strategy. Moreover, as an interconnected\nequipment for AC-DC hybrid distribution network, PET\nneeds to meet the requirements of power supply reliabil-\nity and power quality maintenance. In this paper, for the\npurposes of maintaining stable operation of the power\ngrid, assisting grid voltage recovery and ensuring the\nsafety of PET itself, the basic control objectives of PET\nLVRT are proposed as follows:\n1) When an asymmetric short circuit fault occurs in\nthe power grid, the negative sequence current is\neliminated by the negative sequence current\nsuppression measures to ensure the symmetry of\nthe current injected into the grid;\n2) According to the degree of positive sequence\nvoltage sag on the AC side, the reactive current\ninjection is automatically adjusted to help the grid\nvoltage recovery;\n3) According to the active power condition before the\nvoltage sag and the degree of positive sequence\nvoltage sag on the AC side, the active transmission\nlevel and direction are maintained as far as possible\nunder the premise of ensuring that the PET current\ndoes not exceed the limit, for which the disturbance\nto the AC/DC grid is reduced.\nThe block diagram of the LVRT strategy is shown in\nFig. 5, In which α is the positive sequence voltage sag\ndegree, which is the ratio of the positive sequence volt-\nage amplitude during voltage sag to the normal oper-\nation voltage amplitude, that is:\nα ¼ uþ\nsdþ=usd0 ð2Þ\nWhen PET detects α < 0.9, it is switched to LVRT con-\ntrol mode automatically. In the case of AC power grid\nFig. 4 Steady state control schematic diagram of PET\nHan et al.

The current inner\nloop is directly used for control to improve the overall re-\nsponse speed by blocking the outer loop of the controller.\n2.2.2 Implementation of LVRT\nA. Inner loop design\nThe PET pre-stage AC-DC converter realizes the\npower conversion between AC and bipolar DC. The\ntransformation modules of the two star cascaded struc-\ntures are identical, so the mathematical model and con-\ntrol strategy are also identical. Therefore, this section\nonly discusses the transformation module between the\nAC side and the unipolar DC.\nThe mathematical model of the AC side of the AC-DC\nmodule of PET shown in Fig. 2 is\nLarm\ndia\ndt þ Reqia ¼ usa−ua\nLarm\ndib\ndt þ Reqib ¼ usb−ub\nLarm\ndic\ndt þ Reqic ¼ usc−uc\n8\n>>>>><\n>>>>>:\nð3Þ\nIn (3), Larm is the bridge arm filter inductor, Req is the\nseries equivalent resistance of the IGBT turn-on resistors\nof cascaded H-bridge sub-module and filter inductor\nadditional resistor, usa, usb and usc are the point of com-\nmon connection (PCC) voltage, isa, isb and isc are the\ngrid-connected current, ua, ub and uc are multi-level\nvoltages obtained by superimposing the output of sub-\nmodule on the AC side of the AC-DC module.\nThe overall mathematical model of the AC-DC mod-\nule in the three-phase stationary coordinate system\nshown in (3) is not conducive to the control system de-\nsign, and it can be transformed into a two-phase rotating\ncoordinate system, that is\nLarm\ndid\ndt þ Reqid ¼ usd−ud þ ωLarmiq\nLarm\ndiq\ndt þ Reqiq ¼ usq−uq‐ωLarmid\n8\n><\n>:\nð4Þ\nDuring voltage asymmetric sags, the system voltage\nand current will contain positive and negative sequence\ncomponents.

When the voltage sags by more\nthan 10%, for every 10% sag, PET provides 15% reactive\npower compensation to the AC grid, supporting the\nPCC voltage of the grid to help restore the grid voltage.\nThe maximum compensation capacity of PET is 1.2\ntimes the rated current.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 6 Voltage asymmetric sag current inner loop control block diagram ( a) Positive sequence components in forward rotation\ncoordinate system ( b) Negative sequence component in reverse rotation coordinate system\nFig. 7 Current inner loop unified control block diagram\nFig. 8 Schematic diagram of active current\ncompensation capability\nHan et al.

Active power maintenance\nThe main practice of renewable energies to achieve\nLVRT is to perform dynamic reactive power support ac-\ncording to the degree of system voltage drop, but the in-\nstruction value of active current is not clearly defined.\nBased on the dynamic reactive power support, the LVRT\nstrategy proposed in this paper gives a novel active\ncurrent instruction value algorithm to maintain the\ntransmission direction and level of active power of PET\nin normal and LVRT conditions as much as possible,\nthus reducing the disturbance to the AC-DC hybrid dis-\ntribution network.\nDuring the grid voltage sag, the active power absorbed\nby PET from the grid is shown in (11).\np ¼ uþ\nsdþiþ\ndþ þ uþ\nsqþiþ\nqþ þ u−\nsd−i−\nd− þ u−\nsq−i−\nq− ð11Þ\nWhen the positive sequence d-axis voltage orientation\nis adopted, uþ\nsqþ ¼ 0.

It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the\nrequirement of maintaining the active level before the\nvoltage sag can be achieved according to the (14). Tak-\ning the active current instruction value of 0.6 before the\nvoltage sag as an example, as shown in Fig. 8, the hori-\nzontal dotted line in the figure is the active current\nbefore the voltage sag. Under the condition that the volt-\nage sag is not less than 55%, the control strategy can\nensure the active before and after the voltage sag. The\ntransmission level and direction remain constant.\n3 Simulation results and discussion\nIn order to verify the effectiveness of the PET LVRT\nstrategy proposed in this paper, a four-port PET simula-\ntion model was built in PSCAD/EMTDC for simulation\nverification. The simulation model is shown in Fig. 9.I n\nthe simulation model, the DC bus voltage is mainly\nFig. 11 Phase A voltage and current when the voltage\ndrops in the inverter state\nFig. 12 dq-axis current when the voltage drops in the\nrectified state\nFig. 13 dq-axis current when the voltage drops in the\ninverter state\nFig. 14 Power waveform when the voltage drops in the\nrectified state\nHan et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:20 Page 8 of 12\ncontrolled by the energy storage system with the cap-\nacity of 5 MW.\nThe PET is connected to the AC grid through a line-\nfrequency transformer, and the DC side is incorporated\nwith a ± 750 V DC bus with distributed power and DC\nloads. The low voltage DC port and the low voltage AC\nport respectively supply power to the DC and AC loads.\nWhen the symmetric short circuit and the asymmetric\nshort circuit occur at point f, the voltage symmetry and\nasymmetry sag at the 10 kV bus are adjusted by adjust-\ning the fault resistance to verify the PET LVRT strategy\nproposed in this paper. The main simulation parameters\nare shown in Table 1.\n3.1 Voltage symmetric sag\nSymmetric sag of three-phase voltage occurs at the con-\nnection bus of PET, the sag moment is t = 0.3 s, the\ndegree of sag is α = 0.4. The PET is set to operate in unit\npower factor of P* = 0.375 and P* = − 0.375 before the\nvoltage sag. The current instruction values obtained ac-\ncording to (9), (10) and (15) and power values measured\nin the simulation model are shown in Table 2.\nFigures 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are current and\npower simulation waveforms of the two operating\nconditions shown in Table 2 in the case of voltage sym-\nmetric sag.\nFigure 10 and Fig. 11 are voltage and current wave-\nforms of phase A when the voltage drops in the rectified\nand inverter state.\nFigures 12 and 13 show the dq-axis current instruction\nvalue and actual value waveforms. It is considered that\nthere is 5 ms adjustment delay of the phase-locked\nloop(PLL), the outer loop of the controller is blocked\nwithin 5 ms after detecting that the positive sequence\nvoltage sags, and the dq current reference value before\nthe voltage sag is used as the inner loop instruction\nvalue. This method can prevent the power fluctuation\ncaused by the adjustment of PLL, as well as the influence\nof the control system and PET for the output jitter of\nPLL caused by the voltage flicker on the normal\noperation.\nFigures 14 and 15 show the waveforms of PET absorp-\ntion power. After the voltage sags, PET can inject react-\nive power into the AC system according to the voltage\nsag depth to help the AC system voltage recovery. And\ncan maintain the active transmission level before the\nfault.\nFig. 15 Power waveform when the voltage drops in the\ninverter state\nTable 3 Low voltage ride through parameters of voltage\nasymmetric sag\nVariable No\nload\nFull load\nRectified state Inverter state\nBefore Voltage sag P/C3 ði/C3\nd0Þ 01 −1\nQ/C3 ði/C3\nq0Þ 00 0\nAfter Voltage Sag α = 0.4 iþ/C3\ndþ 0 1.112 −1.112\niþ/C3\nqþ 0.45 0.45 0.45\ni−/C3\nd− 00 0\ni−/C3\nq− 00 0\nFig. 16 Positive sequence dq-axis current when the voltage\ndrops under no-load condition\nFig. 17 Three-phase grid-connected current when the\nvoltage drops under no-load condition\nHan et al. Protection and Control of Modern Power Systems            (2019) 4:20 Page 9 of 12\n3.2 Voltage asymmetric sag\nThe A-phase voltage at the connection bus of PET is un-\nchanged, and the amplitude of BC two-phase voltage\nsags to 40% of the original value. According to the sym-\nmetrical components method, the positive sequence\nvoltage sag depth can be obtained as α = 0.6. Under this\ncondition, the simulation is verified for the case of no-\nload and full-load operation before the voltage sag. The\ncurrent instruction value under different operating con-\nditions of voltage asymmetric sag can be calculated by\n(9), (10) and (15), as shown in Table 3.\n3.2.1 PET no load before voltage sag\nFigure 16 shows the waveform of the positive sequence\ncurrent dq-axis component in the forward rotation co-\nordinate system, which runs at no load before the volt-\nage asymmetric sags. The current inner loop can quickly\nand accurately track the inner loop current instruction\nvalue within 5 ms, and can adjust the q-axis current to\ninject reactive power into the grid. The corresponding\nthree-phase current waveform is shown in Fig. 17.\nBecause of the negative sequence current elimination,\nthe three-phase current can be injected symmetrically\ninto the grid and reduce the impact on the grid.\n3.2.2 PET full load before voltage sag\nAs shown in Table 3, the PET in full load condition be-\nfore the voltage asymmetry sag is simulated according to\nthe power transmission direction. Figures 18 and 19 are\nwaveforms of positive and negative sequence current dq\naxis components in the forward and reverse coordinate\nsystems in the case where PET absorbs active power. It\ncan be seen that the positive sequence current can\nquickly follow the instruction value change within 5 ms,\nand the negative sequence current inner loop can\nquickly eliminate the negative sequence current after the\nvoltage sags.\nFigure 20 and Fig. 21 are three-phase current wave-\nforms and power waveforms in the case where PET in-\njects active power into the AC system. It can be seen\nthat the negative sequence flow elimination control\nstrategy can ensure the symmetry of the current injected\ninto the grid under the condition of asymmetric voltage\nsag. PET can perform reactive power compensation to\nthe grid to assist the grid voltage recovery, maintain the\nactive power level as far as possible to reduce the dis-\nturbance to the grid.\nIn the simulation model, the DC bus voltage is con-\ntrolled by a 5 MW energy storage system connected to\nFig. 18 Positive sequence dq-axis current when the voltage\ndrops under full load condition\nFig. 19 Negative sequence dq-axis current when the voltage\ndrops under full load condition\nFig. 20 Three-phase grid-connected current when the\nvoltage drops under full load condition\nFig. 21 Power waveform when the voltage drops under full\nload condition\nHan et al.

The DC bus voltage waveform of the PET\nduring LVRT operation under rectification and inverter\nconditions is given in the Fig. 22. It can be seen that\nunder the joint action of the energy storage system and\nthe PET, the DC bus voltage can be kept constant.\n4 Conclusion\nIn this paper, a LVRT strategy that is suitable for power\nbidirectional transmission of PET is proposed, the effect-\niveness of which under voltage symmetric and asymmet-\nric sag conditions is verified by simulation model. This\nstrategy mainly implements the following functions:\n1) During the voltage sag of the PET AC side, the\npower or voltage outer loop is blocked, and the\ncurrent inner loop instruction value is given\ndirectly, which can improve the overall response\nspeed of the system.\n2) During the voltage asymmetric sag, the negative\nsequence current is eliminated to ensure the\nsymmetry of the current injected into the grid.\n3) According to the degree of positive sequence\nvoltage sag, the corresponding reactive current\ninjection is performed to help the grid voltage\nrecover.\n4) According to the active power condition before the\nvoltage sag, the level and direction of active power\nare kept as far as possible within the upper limit of\nthe current-carrying, and the disturbance to the AC\nand DC grids is reduced.\nAbbreviations\nLVRT: Low voltage ride through; MMC: Modular Multilevel Converter;\nPCC: Point of common connection; PET: Power electronic transformer;\nPLL: Phase-locked loop\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable\nAuthors’ contributions\nJH participated in the simulation model building and helped to draft the\nmanuscript.
