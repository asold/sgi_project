While lower efﬁciency and\nhigher cost compared to the conventional transformer are well\nknown and investigated limiting factors, the required higher\nmaintenance, related to the use of electronics systems in the\nelectric grid, is seldom targeted. In fact, high maintenance cost\nwould make the use of Smart T ransformer inapplicable even\nif new services could justify higher initial cost and new semi-\nconductor development could increase the overall efﬁciency . This\nwork proposes a modular repairable system based on condition\nmonitoring, which aims at equalizing the lifetime consumption of\nthe single modules to make possible prognostic maintenance.\nI. I N T RO D U C T I O N\nThe continuous increase of grid connected renewable energy\nsystems and the consequently fast-changing power ﬂow in\nthe electrical distribution grid is challenging the current grid\nconﬁguration. Additionally , new loads, such as electrical ve-\nhicle charging stations, absorb peak power, which complicates\nthe control of the grid nodes and calls for new concepts to\novercome the related problems [1]. Among different solutions,\nthe Smart Transformer (ST) as the link for the medium-to-low-\nvoltage (MV/L V) distribution would allow a slow transition\ntowards more intelligent low-voltage grids, while still retaining\nthe backwards compatibility with existing equipment used in\nthe actual grid [2]. The availability of DC links in MV and\nL V side of the ST allows to decouple the grids and to provide\nservices to both AC grids. By controlling the amplitude of\nvoltage, the load consumption can be controlled [3], while\nthe frequency variation can act on the droop control of the\ngenerators in the grid, which can also be used to prevent\nreverse power ﬂow in the grid [4].\nThe main challenges for a ST are the efﬁciency and the\nreliability , as the standard low-frequency passive transformers\nset the reference levels to very high targets. In literature works\naddressing the reliability of modular power converter structure\ncan be found [5], and the ﬁndings support the thesis that\nManuscript received October 06, 2016; revised March 31, 2017; accepted\nJune 28, 2017. This work was supported by the European Research Coun-\ncil under the European Unions Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-\n2013)/ERC Grant Agreement 616344Heart.\nThe authors are with the Chair of Power Electronics, Christian-\nAlbrechts Universitt zu Kiel 24118 Kiel, Germany (e-mail: ma@tf.uni-kiel.de;\nvir@tf.uni-kiel.de; gibu@tf.uni-kiel.de; liserre@ieee.org.\nmodular architectures allow increasing the efﬁciency . During\npartial load operation, the efﬁciency can even be optimized by\ncontrolling the number of activated/deactivated modules [6].\nHowever, the deactivation process of a module is complex and\nrequires special attention to remain in the safe operation area\nof the power semiconductors, which is realized with special\ngate drivers in the cited work. Furthermore, the power quality\nis compromised by an increased current ripple in the output\ncurrent and the capacitors, if the converters are operating in\ninterleaved operation. So the activation/deactivation of mod-\nules achieves an increase of the efﬁciency at the cost of\npower quality deterioration, uneven lifetime consumption of\nthe overall system and lower reliability .\nIn a modular architecture with many cells, it is reason-\nable that when a cell fails, the cell is replaced and sent to\nmaintenance irrespective of the failed components. The same\ncell is repaired and becomes available as a replacement unit.\nEventually , a ST modular system is composed of differently\naged cells [7].\nT o overcome the problem of different remaining lifetimes\nof the power electronic modules, this work proposes to take\nadvantage of the modularity of the system in another way . The\nproposed approach is not to shut down modules, but to route\nthe power along different paths in partial load operation [7],\n[8], [9]. This enables to control the lifetime of the system\nand to extend the operation time for modules with high\naccumulated damage, which can be estimated with condition\nmonitoring techniques. The goal is to let the weaker modules\nsurvive until the next maintenance is made, stressing them\nless compared to the stronger ones. Given these premises,\nthe power is shared among the modules depending on the\nconsumed lifetime. Moreover, the consumed lifetime estimated\nto implement this power routing can also be used to schedule\nprognostic maintenance.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the\nconcept of condition monitoring. In section III the power\nrouting is introduced and in the following section IV the\nsystem and the controller implementation is explained. An\nexperimental validation is made in section V before the con-\nclusion is drawn in section VI.\nII.

In literature it has been reported that these are\nthe capacitors and the power semiconductors [11], [12]. This\npaper focuses only on the failures caused by semiconductors.\nThe physics of failure concept used for the reliability analysis\ncan be utilized for a lifetime prediction. As an example for\npower semiconductors, the manufacturers provide the time to\nfailure by the number of thermal cycles to failure Nf , which\nis expressed in (1), where ∆ T is the magnitude of the thermal\nswing, whereas Tj,av is he average junction temperature during\nthis swing and a1, a2 and a3 are ﬁtting parameters.\nNf = a1 ·(∆ T )a2 ·e\na3\nTj,av+273◦C (1)\nUnlike the power cycling tests, where ∆ T is constant, the\nmission proﬁle of an ST based smart grid is not deterministic\nand hence a cycle counting method is required to decompose\nthe temperature proﬁle. The rainﬂow algorithm is one the\nwidely employed cycle counting method for fatigue analysis\n[13]. Subsequently , Miner’s rule can be applied to calculate\nthe accumulated damage using [14]\nDacc =\n∑ Ni\nNfi\n(2)\nwhere Dacc is the accumulated damage, Ni the number of\ndetected cycles in the i-th stress range and Nfi the number of\ncycles to failure of the i-th stress range. When the accumulated\ndamage becomes 1, the device fails. It is assumed that the\ndamage accumulates linearly .\nFurthermore, there are parameters in the system, which corre-\nlate with the degradation. Using real time measurement system\nfor monitoring these parameters is referred to as condition\nmonitoring. By employing condition monitoring with health\nprognostics, this enables to schedule the maintenance and\nreplacements before a component fails and thus prevents down\ntimes of a system.\nFor health monitoring in power electronic converters, the\npossible parameters which can be used as indicators for the\ncondition monitoring are shown in Fig. 1. Here, the system\nis grouped into smaller parts to enable the desired model\nprecision in the estimation of the remaining lifetime. The\nsimplest form is to measure the time in operation with the\nassumption that the oldest part fails ﬁrst. This approach lacks\nof physical background, but is commonly applied in the\nindustry to schedule maintenance of components. The strongest\nadvantage is that no additional sensors are required, while it is\nsimple and does not cause errors due to wrong measurements.\nFor a better lifetime estimation, the components, which are\nprone to fail ﬁrst, need be identiﬁed and their related failure\nmechanisms need to be investigated. As pointed out before,\ncritical components for power converters are capacitors and\npower semiconductors. Condition monitoring for electrolytic\ncapacitors is possible by monitoring the series ESR and the\ncapacitance of the capacitors, which can be implemented for\nreal time application [15]. For power electronics, condition\nmonitoring is extremely complex because of the various pos-\nsible failure mechanisms and the various possible parame-\nters, which can be monitored. Different parameters such as\nCollector-Emitter saturation voltage Vce, IGBT turn on resis-\ntance, thermal resistance, gate signals, switch times etc. can\nbe used to estimate the lifetime of the power semiconductors\n[16]. Among these techniques, Vce measurement will be a\nstandard in high power converters since they can also be used\nto monitor the junction temperature for avoiding trivial failures\n[17]. The failure criterion to deﬁne the end-of-life for the\ncomponent for the Vce measurement is already well established\n[18]. This Vce measurement can be used for the sensing of the\njunction temperature and thermal cycle counting & damage\naccumulation as expressed with (1)-(2).\nA comprehensive work including the condition monitoring\nand prognostics for the lifetime of power semiconductors\nhas been made in [19]. The work demonstrates a lifetime\nestimation technique based on accelerated lifetime tests.\nIII. P OW E R RO U T I N G I N M O D U L A R P OW E R C O N V E RT E R S\nWith respect to the state of the art, turning off one or\nmore redundant converters is applied to improve the efﬁciency\nduring partial load operation [6]. This deactivation changes\nthe stress distribution in the system and impacts the power\nquality in terms of current and voltage ripple. Consequently ,\nthe operating converters are loaded higher, which leads to more\nsevere thermal cycles. Since thermal cycles are the main cause\nof aging in power electronic modules, the module, which is\nturned off is relieved from the stress induced by the mission\nproﬁle. As a consequence, the thermal stress for those parts of\nthe system, which continue to operate, is increased. This leads\nto an unequal expected remaining lifetime of all parts. Instead\nof turning parts off, the concept of power routing operates\nthe power converter under unequal loading conditions for the\nmaximization of the time to the next maintenance [7].\nRouting the power can reduce the thermal stress caused by\npower cycling during normal converter operation for speciﬁc\nparts of the system. This can follow the target of stress\nreduction for speciﬁc parts of the power converters, e.g. when\none parallel converter is suffering from wear out and has a low\nremaining lifetime with respect to the others. For an optimiza-\ntion, the information obtained from the condition monitoring\n3\ntime\ntime\ntime\nEstimated remaining\n lifetime\nFailure criteria\nRelative power \ndistribution\n0\nEnd of life with \npower routing\ncell 1 cell 2 cell 3\ncell 1 cell 2 cell 3\nDelay of the failure\nEnd of life without\npower routing\nCummulative \ndamage\nFig. 2: Demonstration of the power routing concept for three\nredundant power paths with different lifetimes with power\nrouting for extending the time to the next failure.\nis used and applied to control the lifetime of all parts in\nthe system. This is demonstrated in Fig. 2. The accumulated\ndamage is used as the parameter for the determination of\nlifetime for the three converters [20]. Here, the failure criteria\nis when the accumulated damage becomes unity . The aging is\ndemonstrated as it is commonly done without modifying the\npower distribution in the system with thin lines. Consequently ,\nthe end-of-lifetime (EL T) happens when the ﬁrst converter is\nfailing. The concept of the power routing is demonstrated with\nbold lines, while the difference is highlighted with the arrows.\nThe different lifetimes of the cells are used to route the power\nin the way , that the converter, which would naturally fail ﬁrst,\nis unloaded, while the other converters with longer expected\nlifetimes are loaded higher. As a consequence, the failure can\nbe delayed and during the next maintenance one or more parts\ncan be substituted.\nHowever, the converters are not overdesigned for the power\nrouting. In case of the above example with three parallel\ncells, the maximum current I1,out,max , which one cell can\ntransfer is limited by its rated current. For unloading one cell,\nthe minimum current is dependent on the number of parallel\nconverters np and the overall output current Iout. This is\nexpressed in (3).\nI1,out,min =\n{ 0 if (np − 1) ·I < I out\nIout − (np − 1) ·I, otherwise\n(3)\nWith this equation, it can be shown, that in a converter\nwith three cells np = 3 , one cell can be completely unloaded\nMVDC LVDC\nMVAC stage LVAC stageIsolation stage\nFig. 3: Schematic architecture of the three-stage ST .\nup to 66. 7 % of the rated current.

The impact of virtual resistance based power\nrouting on the lifetime of the converter system is quantitatively\ninvestigated. Moreover, the variation of estimated lifetime with\ndifferent virtual resistance algorithms are also presented.\nIV .

ST Architecture\nWith the motivation for services in the distribution grid,\na three-stage ST architecture in Fig. 3 is the most likely\nconﬁguration [21] and it is chosen as a reference in this paper.\nEach stage controls a speciﬁc variable: the L V converter imple-\nments a voltage closed-loop control, to ensure grid waveforms\nwith low T otal Harmonic Distortion (THD), while the DC/DC\nconverter controls the Low V oltage Direct Current (L VDC)\nlink voltage, ensuring a stable supply for the L V converter. The\nDC/DC converter also performs the balancing of the MV cells.\nFinally , the MV converter implements the Medium V oltage\nAlternating Current (MV AC) closed loop current control, in\norder to regulate the total Medium V oltage Direct Current\n(MVDC) link, which is providing the power for the isolation\nstage.\nB. System description of three parallel power converters\nThe L V stage of the ST is forming the L V grid and consists\nof three parallel converters as schematically shown in Fig. 4.\nThe converters require access to the fourth wire, because of the\nnumerous single phase loads in the grid. Using the two level\nvoltage source converter, as it is commonly done for motor\ndrives, enables to add a fourth half bridge to the converter\nas it is shown in Fig. 5. This half bridge is connected to\n4\nLVDC LVAC\nFilter\nFilter\nFilter\nFig. 4: System of three power converters for the L V stage.\nLVDC\nT1 D1\nLVACL0\nFig. 5: T opology of one two level VSI.\nthe star point of the DC link for preventing high common\nmode voltages. The loading of the power semiconductors is\nsymmetrical over time, which requires to only investigate the\neffect on one IGBT T1 and one Diode D1 in a half bridge.\nSince the ST operates at partial load for most of the time as\nshown in the Fig. 6, the parallel converters allow redundancy\nat partial load operation. However, since there is no over-\nsizing of converters, all the converters are required to cater the\nfull power operation. The possibility of interleaved operation\nof the converters enables a reduction of either the switching\nfrequency or the ﬁlter size in comparison with a single power\nconverter. Apart from the advantages of parallel converters,\nthere are issues, such as circulating currents if a shared DC\nlink is used for the three converters [22]. However, this is not\nthe scope of this work and the known solution to use single\nphase inductors for each converter is applied to overcome this\nproblem.\nC. Control of the power in the LV stage\nThe L V stage converter of the ST needs to form the grid\nvoltage of the connected L V grid. As a consequence, the shape\nof the grid voltage needs to be controlled and the active power\ndepends on the connected loads. Thus, the ST needs to control\nthe voltage in an outer control loop and the current in an inner\ncontrol loop. However, only the current control is investigated\nin this work due to its importance for the power routing. The\nimplementation of the power routing in the current controller\nis shown in Fig. 7. The virtual resistors are used to route the\npower similar to current divider in the basics of electronics\nby distributing the current references for the three converters.\nA closed loop control for the power routing is necessary to\nprevent power circulation among different converters.\nPower (p.u)\ndays\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 30\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nLoad Proﬁle [pu]\nFig. 6: Example for a mission proﬁle of an ST fed micro-grid.\ni*\nref\ni*\nc1\ni*\nc2\ni*\nc3\nPower Routing\nPI\nvc2\n*\nPI\nPi\nvc1\n*\nvc3\n*\nic1, ic2, ic3\nRv1\nRv2\nRv3 VSC 2\nVSC 1\nVSC 3\nCurrent control\nCondition Monitoring\nRv1 Rv2 Rv3\nConverter system\ni\nFig. 7: Control diagram of the power routing algorithm based\non condition monitoring.\nT o deﬁne how the power is routed in the system, the virtual\nresistors need to be tuned based on the condition of the\nconverters in the parallel power paths. A high resistance of\na path leads to low loading and a low resistance leads to high\nloading of the path. For similar conditions of the converter, the\npower needs to be distributed equally and all virtual resistors\nneed to have the same size. As an example for the current\ntransferred in converter 1, i∗\nc1, is dependent on the overall\nreference current generated by the voltage controller i∗\nref and\nall virtual resistors in the parallel paths.

Design of V irtual Resistor based P ower Routing\nIn order to establish the relation between the virtual resis-\ntance and estimated lifetime of the converters, ﬁrst, a simpliﬁed\nelectro-thermal model of the parallel converters is developed in\nMA TLAB. The mathematical model consist of the two-level\nconverter equations along with thermal model of the power\nsemiconductor and heatsink for evaluating the semiconductor\nlosses, and thereby the junction temperature. Using this sim-\npliﬁed mathematical model, the junction temperature of the\nsemiconductors can be calculated for any mission proﬁle. The\nheatsink and power semiconductors are chosen and designed\nto have an estimated lifetime of 20 years for the semiconductor\nmodules.\nThe number of cycle to failure can be calculated from the\njunction temperature using (1). Since the mission proﬁle of\nan ST is not deterministic, the Rainﬂow algorithm is used as\nthe cycle counting method and Miner’s rule (2) is applied to\ncalculate the accumulated damage.\nThe virtual resistor based power routing algorithm uses the\nsensed junction temperatures Tj of the power semiconductors\nto estimate the accumulated damage of each converter for a\nﬁxed time period.

For this\nanalysis, a three day mission proﬁle of an ST fed micro-grid,\nas shown in Fig. 6, is considered [23],[24].\nFirst, the three converters are fed with balanced power dis-\ntribution, irrespective of the initial accumulated damages,\nthe accumulated damages and end-of-lifetimes are calculated.\nThen virtual resistors are introduced according to (9)-(10) and\nthe accumulated damages and EL Ts are calculated.\nThree cases with different initial damages for each converter\nare considered here. Fig. 8, 9, 10 show the damage accu-\nmulation over the years for a modular converter system with\ndifferent initial damages for cases 1 − 3. It is evident that\nwithout power routing, the converters will fail at different\ntime instants. With virtual resistor method, the accumulated\ndamages converge resulting in the control of processed power\ndependent failure of the system. The impact of power routing\non the lifetime extension of the total system of the cases 1− 3 is\nsummarized in Fig. 11. The exponential function describes the\nrelation between damage and virtual resistors more accurately\nand hence the EL Ts of are better compared to the linear one in\nall three cases. The percentage increase in the total estimated\nlifetime of the system is depicted in the Fig. 11. In all the cases\nwith different initial estimated lifetimes, there is an increase\nin the total estimated lifetime of the system up to 44%.\n6\n0 20 40 60 80 100 1200\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nmonths\nCumultaive damage\n \nWithout VR(Conv 1)\nWithout VR(Conv 2)\nWithout VR(Conv 3)\nLinear VR(Conv 1)\nLinear VR(Conv 2)\nLinear VR(Conv 3)\nExponential VR(Conv 1)\nExponential VR(Conv 2)\nExponential VR(Conv 3)\nFig. 10: Case 3: V ariation of accumulated damage of parallel\nconverters with and without V irtual Resistor (VR) power\nrouting.\nMonths\n \n1 2 3 40\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n \n \nELT of Conv 2 & Conv 3\nELT with Linear VR\nELT with Exponential VR\nELT of Conv 1\n+7.62 %\n+12.2 %\n+20.93 %\n+22.09 %\nCase\n+20.51 %\n+29.9 %\n+41.1 %\n+44.18 %\nFig. 11: Estimated lifetime (EL T) of parallel converters with\nand without virtual Resistor (VR) power routing for different\ncases.\nIt is assumed that the modular system reaches it’s EL T when\nthe module with lowest EL T fails. The results clearly shows\nthat the virtual resistors can increase the lifetime of the most\naged cell and most importantly , decrease frequent maintenance\nschedules. However, it is evident that the increase in EL T of\nthe system comes at the expense of lowering the EL Ts of the\nhigher loaded cells.\nP arallel converters with different thermal characteristics:\nT o validate the performance of virtual resistors for a parallel\nconverter system with different thermal characteristics, a case\nstudy is performed. Here, all converters are assumed to have\nidentical initial accumulated damages. Due to the difference\nin thermal characteristics, the converters have different EL Ts,\nwhich is shown as case 4 in Fig. 11. Here, the heatsink tem-\nperature of one of the parallel converters is assumed to be 5◦C\n30\n400.5 50\n1\n0.6\nPower [%]\n1.5\n70\n2\nVirtual resistor value, R  [W]v3\n2.5\n80\n3\n90\n3.5\n100\n1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1\n2.88 %\n3.22 %\nTHD [%]\n0.9 %\n0.9 %\nFig. 12: THD variation of line current with virtual resistance\nunbalance for entire power range. The virtual resistance of\nconverter 1 and converter 2 is normalized to Rv1 = Rv2 = 1 Ω .\nhigher than that of the others. This is a reasonable assumption\nsince the heatsinks are cooled with air/water entering from one\nend and leaving at the other, resulting in an uneven distribution\nof the heat. The EL Ts of the converters without power routing\nare 86 and 117 months for the converter with higher heatsink\ntemperature and others respectively . A signiﬁcant increase of\nthe total lifetime of the system of 22% or 19 months is obtained\nwith the virtual resistor based power routing. Thus, the power\nrouting strategy does not only increases the reliability of\nsystems with different initial aging, but also for systems with\ndifferent thermal behavior.\nIt can be concluded from the case studies that the linear and\nexponential functions of virtual resistors provide comparable\nresults. The linear function does not require any tuning based\non the expected mission proﬁle of the system, which makes the\nimplementation simple and straightforward. The exponential\nfunction instead offers one more tuning parameter, which\ncan be tuned based on the expected mission proﬁle and the\nremaining useful lifetime of the other parts to control the\nconvergence time of the different lifetimes.\nEffect of power routing on line current ripple: T o demon-\nstrate the effect of a power unbalance on the line current ripple\nand consequently the THD, a simulation study with unbalanced\nvirtual resistors is carried out. T wo of the three virtual resistors\nare constant Rv1 = Rv2 = 1 Ω , while the third one is varied to\nshow the effect on the current ripple. The result is illustrated\nin Fig. 12, where the x-axis shows the output power and the\ny-axis shows the the virtual resistor of converter 3. For a\nRv3 = 1 Ω , the system is operated under balanced condition\nand as the value decreases, the power distribution changes\naccording to (6). The THD (in %) is shown on the z-axis. As\nexpected, the THD of the line current increases for an reduction\nof the output power. For an increasing power imbalance, an\nincrease in the THD of the output current can be seen. Under\nfull load, this does not occur, because of the power is equally\ndistributed in the converters in order to prevent oversizing of\ncomponents.\n7\nConverter 2\nOpen IGBT \nmodule 3\nOptic fiber \ntemperature \nsensors\nSignal conditioner for the \ntemperature measurement\nHigh speed infrared \ncamera\nConverter 3\nConverter 1\nFig. 13: Picture of the setup showing the three parallel con-\nverters assembled on one heat sink, a signal conditioner for\nthe ﬁber optic temperature sensors and high speed infrared\ncamera for junction temperature measurement of a full power\nelectronic module.\nT ABLE I: Parameters of the laboratory setup.\nRated current per converter 25 A\nDC link voltage 200 V\nFilter size 1. 8 mH\nLoad R 3. 5 Ω\nFundamental frequency 50 Hz\nswitching frequency 20 kHz\nPower Semiconductor module Danfoss DP 25H1200T 101667 − 10166\nV . E X P E R I M E N TA L V A L I DAT I O N O F P OW E R RO U T I N G\nThis section validates the concept of power routing on\nthe experimental setup shown in Fig. 13. The three parallel\nconverters with open IGBT modules share the same DC\nlink and have single phase inductors at the output of each\nphase. The IGBT modules are not ﬁlled with gel for direct\nmeasurement of the junction temperature, which is reducing\nthe voltage blocking capability of the power module. However,\nthe removal of silicone gel does only marginally affect the\nthermal behavior, because the thermal conductivity of silicone\ngel or air is very low . A three phase resistive load is fed by the\nconverters and the parameters of the setup are shown in T able\nI. First, the impact of unequal loading of parts of the system\nis demonstrated afterwards the efﬁciency impact of the power\nrouting is demonstrated with power analyzer measurements.\nA. Reliability impact of power routing\nIn this subsection, the effect of unequal loading on the junc-\ntion temperature of the converter is investigated. The junction\ntemperature of the power semiconductors is measured with a\nspecial optical ﬁber instrument and this enables to measure\nthe junction temperature with the open modules shown in the\nsetup.\nThe infrared camera is used to detect the hottest spots in the\npower electronic module. The hotspot is affected by the self-\nheating of the chip as well as by the thermal cross coupling\nFiber obtic \nsensor\nFig. 14: Infrared camera picture of the power electronic module\nshowing the thermal distribution of a full power electronic\nmodule highlighting the temperature on the IGBTs.\nbetween the power semiconductors. An image of the power\nelectronic module is shown in Fig. 14. It can be seen that\nthe chips are hotter than the bond wires. Furthermore, the\npower semiconductors, which are located close to each other\nobtain the hottest chip temperature. The highest temperature is\nindicated with the measurement point ”P2” and measures the\ntemperature of IGBT 1. For this reason, in each of the converter\nthe junction temperature of the IGBT T1 is measured. For\nthe demonstration of the unequally loaded devices, the three\nconverters feed constant current and the current distribution\nis varied slowly as shown in Fig. 15. Initially , converter\n3 is loaded less that the other two converters and through\na variation of the virtual resistor, all converters are loaded\nequally at t = 20 s. Afterwards, converter 3 is loaded higher,\nwhile the other two converters are unloaded. The virtual\nresistors are varied again to achieve equal power transfer and\nthen converter 3 is loaded higher. From the reference current,\nit can be seen, that the power is routed according to the virtual\nresistors as desired. The measured currents are in accordance\nwith the reference value. However, even more important is the\nvisible effect on the junction temperature. During equal loading\nof the converters, the junction temperature is approximately\nequal, but unloading a part leads to a reduction in the junction\ntemperature. Similarly , the highly loaded converters exhibit an\nincreased junction temperature. Thus the capability to route\nthe power among the different converters is demonstrated.\nIn the next step, the effect of the power routing on the\nthermal stress and consequently on the reliability is demon-\nstrated. For this purpose, the reference current i∗\nref is varied for\n8\n0\n0.5\n1\ntime [s]\nRv []\n0\n10\n20\ntime [s]\nIref [A]\n-20\n0\n20\ntime [s]\nIc1 [A]\n-20\n0\n20\ntime [s]\nIc2 [A]\n-20\n0\n20\ntime [s]\nIc3 [A]\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10065\n70\n75\n80\n85\ntime [s]\nTj [°C]\nRv1 = Rv2\nRv3\nIc1,ref = Ic2,ref\nIc3,ref\nCurrents converter 1\nCurrents converter 2\nIGBT 1, Converter 3\nIGBT 1, Converter 1\nIGBT 1, Converter 2\nCurrents converter 3\nFig. 15: Measurement: Power routing in three parallel convert-\ners by means of virtual resistors for constant output power and\na variation of the virtual resistors.\ndifferent virtual resistors and the resultant power distribution\nis shown in (11).\n[ Rv1\nRv2\nRv3\n]\n=\n[ 0. 5\n0. 5\n1\n]\n→\n[ Pc1\nPc2\nPc3\n]\n=\n[ 40 %\n40 %\n20 %\n]\n(11)\nIn this case only the current is varied, while all other\nparameters are kept constant. The power cycle can be seen\nin the reference value of Fig. 16 as well as in the cur-\nrent distribution among the converters. Again, the measured\ncurrents have the same magnitude as the reference current,\nwhich demonstrates the functionality of the power routing.\nThe power cycle is causing a thermal cycle in the junction\ntemperature measurements as expected. The thermal cycle\nshows a proportional behavior to the power distribution, which\nresults in ∆ T = 10 K for converter 1 and converter 2, while\nthe thermal cycle in converter 3 is only ∆ T = 5 K. Also the\naverage temperature of converter 3 is reduced.\nAs a consequence, the lifetime of the power semiconductors\nis consumed unequally . Following the simple lifetime model\nexpressed in (1), the ∆ T inﬂuences the lifetime consumption\nexponentially with a factor a2 ≈ 5, leading to 32 times higher\ndamage for the power semiconductors in converter 1 and 2 in\ncomparison to those in converter 3. This is even ampliﬁed with\nthe difference in the average junction temperature, which is\nalso higher for the two highly loaded converters. Consequently ,\na relatively high remaining lifetime requires only a very small\nimbalance of the power in the converters. A small remaining\nlifetime results in the potential to effectively unload the thermal\nstress from the device for extending its lifetime. Beside the\npotential, it needs to be pointed out that unequal loading of the\ndevices consumes more lifetime of the system if all damages\nare summed up.\ntime [s]\ntime [s]\ntime [s]\ntime [s]\ntime [s]\nRv1 = Rv2\nRv3\nIc1,ref = Ic2,refIc3,ref\nCurrents converter 1\nCurrents converter 2\nCurrents converter 3\nIGBT 1, Converter 3\nIGBT 1, Converter 1\nIGBT 1, Converter 2\n5 K\n10 K\n0\n0.5\n1\nRv [ ]\n0\n5\n10\nI ref [A]\n-10\n0\n10\nIc1 [A]\n-10\n0\n10\nIc2 [A]\n-10\n0\n10\nIc3 [A]\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10045\n50\n55\n60\n65\ntime [s]\nTj [°C]\nFig. 16: Measurement: Power routing in three parallel convert-\ners by means of virtual resistors for power cycle.\nB. Efﬁciency impact of power routing\nThe impact of the power routing on the efﬁciency of the\nsystem is evaluated experimentally in this subsection. For the\ndemonstration of the effects, a Y okogawa WT1800 power\nanalyzer is used to measure the losses of the converter. The\nlosses are measured for the case that two of the converters\nprocess the same power, while the power of a single converter\nis either reduced or increased. The results for the different\npower distribution and the related losses measurement are\nshown in Fig. 17 (b), when a single converter is unloaded\nand when a single converter is overloaded. Due to the open\nmodules, the maximum blocking voltage is limited and thus\nneither the converter nor the operation point are optimized. For\nthis reason, the losses are normalized on the minimum losses\nof the converters found during equal power sharing. The power\ndistribution between the converters is visualized in the upper\nplot and quantiﬁed at the x label of the lower plot.\nThe measurements are obtained for approximately similar\njunction temperatures of Tj1 = Tj2 = Tj3 = 60 ◦C. It can\nbe seen that unloading a power converter increases the losses\nof the converter, which can also be observed for overloading\none converter. Nevertheless, the maximum increase in losses\nis only 0. 5 % in the most extreme operating conditions. In\nneeds to be pointed out that this is the worst operation point,\nwhile smaller variations in the loading of the converters have\na lower increase of the losses. Overloading one converter\nresults in a similar behavior, whereas it needs to be mentioned\nthat not all operation points could be measured because of\nthe high current in the single converter. Nevertheless, the\ntrend, that an increase of the losses results in the reduction of\nthe efﬁciency is similar to the case of unloading one converter.\nVI.

A software based concept\nfor controlling the reliability , the power routing concept, is\nproposed for controlling the lifetime of the modular building\nblocks in the ST . By routing the power, the time to the\nnext maintenance can be maximized and the lifetime of the\nsystem can be increased by approximately 7. 5 − 44% under\nthe investigated conditions. It is experimentally proven that the\nstress distribution between the parallel parts can be controlled,\nconsequent the wear out of the components. As a price to\npay for this increased reliability , the efﬁciency is slightly\nreduced for unequally loaded converters. These ﬁndings are\nfully validated with a special set-up, which allows directly\naccessing the power semiconductor’s junction temperature.\nRE F E R E N C E S\n[1] E. J. Coster, J. M. Myrzik, B.
