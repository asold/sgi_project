    "abstract": "In order to minimize damage in the event of a fire, the ignition point must be detected and dealt with before the fire spreads. However, the method of detecting fire by heat or fire is more damaging because it can be detected after the fire has spread. Therefore, this study proposes a Swin Transformer-based object detection model using explainable meta-learning mining. The proposed method merges the Swin Transformer and YOLOv3 model and applies meta-learning so as to build an explainable object detection model. In order for efficient learning with small data in the course of learning, it applies Few-Shot Learning. To find the causes of the object detection results, Grad-CAM as an explainable visualization method is used. It detects small objects of smoke in the fire image data and classifies them according to the color of the smoke generated when a fire breaks out. Accordingly, it is possible to predict and classify the risk of fire occurrence to minimize damage caused by fire. In this study, with the use of Mean Average Precision (mAP), performance evaluation is carried out in two ways. First, the performance of the proposed object detection model is evaluated. Secondly, the performance of the proposed method is compared with a conventional object detection method’s performance. In addition, the accuracy comparison using the confusion matrix and the suitability of real-time object detection using FPS are judged. Given the results of the evaluation, the proposed method supports accurate and real-time monitoring and analysis.",
