  "abstract": "Predicting the directions of financial markets has been performed using a variety of approaches, and the large volume of unstructured data generated by traders and other stakeholders on social media microblog platforms provides unique opportunities for analyzing financial markets using additional perspectives. Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated very good performance on a variety of sentiment analysis tasks in different domains. However, it is known that sentiment analysis is a very domain-dependent NLP task that requires knowledge of the domain ontology, and this is particularly the case with the financial domain, which uses its own unique vocabulary. Recent developments in NLP and deep learning including LLMs have made it possible to generate actionable financial sentiments using multiple sources including financial news, company fundamentals, technical indicators, as well social media microblogs posted on platforms such as StockTwits and X (formerly Twitter). We developed a financial social media sentiment analyzer (FinSoSent), which is a domain-specific large language model for the financial domain that was pretrained on financial news articles and fine-tuned and tested using several financial social media corpora. We conducted a large number of experiments using different learning rates, epochs, and batch sizes to yield the best performing model. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art FSA models based on over 860 experiments, demonstrating the efficacy and effectiveness of FinSoSent. We also conducted experiments using ensemble models comprising FinSoSent and the other current state-of-the-art FSA models used in this research, and a slight performance improvement was obtained based on majority voting. Based on the results obtained across all models in these experiments, the significance of this study is that it highlights the fact that, despite the recent advances of LLMs, sentiment analysis even in domain-specific contexts remains a difficult research problem.",
