Due to this control cap-\nability, metasurfaces can provide speciﬁc transmission (T) and\nreﬂection (R) functions to work as planar photonic components\ncarrying customized information. Such information can be\nunlocked via a distinguished ﬁeld distribution reconstructed at\nthe observed region. When an incident lightUinc(x0, y0) impinges\nupon a metasurface UT=R\nmeta x0; y0ðÞ , the ﬁeld distribution can be\nexpressed by the convolution ofUT=R\nmeta x0; y0ðÞ Uinc x0; y0ðÞ and an\nimpulse response h(x, y, z) that relates the ﬁelds at the meta-\nsurface. Therefore, theﬁeld distribution on the observation plane\ncan be expressed as (more detail are shown in Supplementary\nNote 1):\nU x; y; zðÞ ¼\nZZþ1\n/C01\nUT=R\nmeta x0; y0ðÞ Uinc x0; y0ðÞ hx /C0 x0; y /C0 y0; zðÞ dx0dy0\nð1Þ\nThe diversity of metasurfaces’ function UT=R\nmeta x0; y0ðÞ serves as the\nbase for realizing lenses8–10, color11–14, polarization ﬁlters15,16\nand holograms17–20.\nMulti-tasked metasurface is preferably desired for more com-\npact nanophotonic devices, which could reconstruct multiple\ndistinguished ﬁeld distributionsU(n) at observed regions. Based on\nEq. 1, previously reported multi-tasked metasurfaces can be\ndivided into three categories (shown in Fig. 1a–c). The ﬁrst\napproach takes advantage of spatial separation as shown in Fig.1a.\nBy separating the observed regions ( S(n))21,22 or interleaving\nsubarrays SðnÞ\n0\n/C16/C17\n23–29 speciﬁcally designed for each functionality\non the metasurface, the spatial multiplexed metasurface can\nreconstruct differentﬁeld distributions (U(n)), but its efﬁciency is\nlimited. The second approach resorts to adjusting functionsU nðÞ\nmeta\nof the metasurface by changing polarizations 30–36, incident\nangles37 or wavelengths38 of beams as shown in Fig.1b. By tai-\nloring meta-atoms, the structurally multiplexed metasurface\ncarries polarization-, angle- or wavelength-dependent responses\nU nðÞ\nmeta to reconstruct different ﬁeld distributions ( U(n)). This\nmethod can achieve higher efﬁciency than the previous one, but\nthe efﬁciency is still limited by the coverage of the required phases\nthat meta-atoms need to achieve. Another approach, as shown in\nFig. 1c, is based on OAM multiplexing chip to read out the pre-set\nincident light (Ainc)39, which pre-generate various information-\ncarrying multifocal beams arrays with corresponding OAM states.\nEach ring groove of the chip can out-couple a determined OAM\norder\n40,41, which equivalently provides a“key” array to read out\nthe distributions U(n) locked in the preset beams by the spatial\nlight modulator (SLM)39. However, the outcoupling efﬁciency of\nslits is much smaller than that in the previous two methods and it\nneeds the beam array to illuminate each meta-atom. So far, a\nmajority of reported multi-tasked metasurface are resorting to the\nspatial freedom, structure complexity or pre-modulation with\ndecoupler, and there is a lack of a convenient way to realize multi-\ntasked functionality by intrinsic properties of light.\nIn this paper, we report a transmission-type multi-momentum\nmeta-transformer, which transforms the intrinsic phases of OAM\n(lħ) and LM (k0ħ) of the incidence light, into various distinct\npatterns in the same plane (Fig. 1d). The meta-transformer is\nmade of the minimalist TiO2 nano-ﬁn array (Fig. 1g, h) and\nprovides a phase proﬁle ψmeta x0; y0ðÞ ¼ 2φ x0; y0ðÞ for the right\ncircularly polarized beam with spin angular momentum (SAM).\nThe phase is based on geometric phase and φ(x0, y0) is the\norientation angle of nano-ﬁns as a function of position. For a\ngiven fabricated metasurface, incident beamsUinc(x0, y0) carrying\nOAM or LM are able to impart extra phase proﬁles ψOAM(x0, y0)\nor affect impulse responseh(k0) to the transmitted light to realize\ndistinct patterns in the same plane right on axis. A multi-OAM\nphase retrieval algorithm is developed to design the OAM meta-\ntransformer, which can“read out” the order of the incident vortex\nbeam. To be more speciﬁc, an image which tells the order of the\nincident vortex beam will be reconstructed at a given plane under\nillumination of vortex beam with certain orders as shown in\nFig. 1e. In addition a multi-LM phase retrieval algorithm is\nproposed to design a LM meta-transformer, that can reconstruct\npatterns “R”, “G” and “B” in the same plane by illuminating it\nwith red k\nRðÞ\n0\n/C16/C17\n, green k GðÞ\n0\n/C16/C17\n, and blue k BðÞ\n0\n/C16/C17\nbeams, respec-\ntively (Fig.1f). This is due to the impulse response in Eq.1 which\nis k0-dependent. Moreover, such LM meta-transformer has\ndemonstrated the capability to display vivid colorful images,\nthanks to the high-efﬁciency of the dielectric metasurface and the\non-axis imaging feature for all wavelengths.\nResults\nPrinciple of multi-momentum meta-transformer. The meta-\nsurface consists of a set of amorphous TiO2 nano-ﬁns arranged in\nsquare pixels on a quartz substrate (Fig.2a). The pixel size is\n325 × 325 nm2 and the TiO2 nano-ﬁn is 80-nm-wide, 250-nm-\nlong and 600-nm-high, which rotates in plane with an orientation\nangle φ. When a circularly polarized beam is normally incident\non the metasurface from the side of quartz, the transmitted light\nconverts to the opposite circular polarization (CP) and acquires a\nphase delay of ±2φ (Supplementary Note 2). Lumerical FDTD\nsolution is employed to optimize the geometrical parameters of\nnano-ﬁns, such that the conversion from one CP to the opposite\nCP is efﬁcient for the operation in broadband visible range (as\nshown in Fig.2b).\nFigure 2c presents the schematic of OAM meta-transformer. A\ncollimated vortex beam with native phase proﬁle ψOAM (x0, y0)\nilluminates the metasurface with its own as-fabricated phase\nψmeta(x0, y0) from the quartz substrate, and the transmitted beam\ncarries the total phase pro ﬁle ψT x0; y0ðÞ ¼ ψOAM x0; y0ðÞ þ\nψmeta x0; y0ðÞ on illuminating area (Supplementary Note 3). The\nmetasurface’s phase functionψmeta(x0, y0), which isﬁxed after the\nfabrication, is deﬁned by the in-plane orientation of nano-ﬁn\narray. The extra phase proﬁle ψOAM(x0, y0) from the incident\nvortex beam is dynamically changeable. As a degree of freedom of\nlight, by feeding different spiral phases to the single-phase\nmetasurface, one meta-transformer can, therefore, provide multi-\nple different phase proﬁles, resulting in different patterns on the\nsame plane.\nThe phase functionψmeta(x0, y0) of OAM meta-transformer is\ndesigned by the multi-OAM phase retrieval algorithm (Supple-\nmentary Note 4). The orientation angle of each nano- ﬁni s\ndetermined by the retrieval phase ψmeta(x0, y0). The schematic\ndiagram of the experimental setup is shown in Supplementary\nFig. 3a and its speci ﬁcation can be found in Supplementary\nNote 6. As shown in Fig.2d, at the given observation plane (z =\n60 μm), a judiciously designed metasurface reconstructs an\n“apple” pattern under illumination with a collimated Laguerre\nGaussian beam with l(1) = −5, while it shows a “spider”\npattern instead when the OAM of the incident beam is changed\nto l\n(2) = 5. The reconstructed images restore the features of the\ndesigned pattern and the crosstalk is suppressed.\nFigure 2e presents the physical principle of LM meta-\ntransformer. The phase function ψmeta(x0, y0) of a metasurface\nis deﬁned by the in-plane orientation of nano-ﬁn array, which\nmeans that the designed metasurface is able to provide the\ndispersionless phase proﬁle.

In the\nvisible region, the monochromatic beams with different LMs\nrepresent different colors. So three-primary colors (red 633 nm,\ngreen 532 nm, and blue 488 nm) are chosen in this work. Based\non the k0-dependent impulse response, the multi-LM phase\nretrieval algorithm (Supplementary Note 5) is deployed here to\ncalculate the phase distribution ψmeta(x0, y0). Hence, the\nwavelength-dependent patterns are reconstructed in the same\nplane (at Z0) and the unwanted patterns are moved out of\nthe observed plane. In this design, based on the retrieval phase\nproﬁle ψmeta(x0, y0), the nano- ﬁns (600 × 600) with rotation\nangles are fabricated on a total area of 192 × 192 μm2.

This meta-transformer is formed by\n300 × 300 nano-ﬁns on the total area 97.5 × 97.5μm2. As shown\nin Fig.3b, the designed OAM meta-transformer reconstructs the\npatterns “0”, “3” and “6” with the incident 0th-, 3rd- and 6th-order\nvortex beams, respectively. Compared with Fig. 2d, the OAM\nmeta-transformer in Fig.3b has lower phase difference among the\nincident vortex beams and encodes more OAM states, which may\nreduce the performance. Nevertheless, the reconstructions in\nFig. 3b are clearly recognizable. The reconstructed patterns pre-\nsent the incident beam’s topological charge values, which suggests\na potential application of OAM topological charge displayer\n(OAM detection by direct reading) with such OAM meta-\ntransformer.\nBased on k0-dependent impulse response, the LM meta-\ntransformer generates LM-dependent patterns on the identical\nposition (Fig. 2e, f). Under illumination of red, green and blue\nbeams simultaneously, these generated patterns overlapping each\nother enable the realization of colorful holographic images\n(Supplementary Note 7). The colorful holographic images contain\nnot only three-primary colors (RGB) but also their secondary\ncolors (cyan, magenta, yellow, as well as white). Moreover, the\nLM meta-transformer can also support complex patterns with\ngradient color (in Fig.4a, b). Figure4b reports the simulation and\nexperimental results for each color and their superposition. These\nresults indicate the accurate spatial control of the reconstructed\nimages, and the crosstalk among different LMs is eliminated. The\nkey feature for such gradient color image is that the color gamut\nspans the whole color triangle. Therefore, the LM meta-transform\nhas the capability to display vivid colorful image.\nThe capability is a critical issue for the multi-tasked metasur-\nface. Based on the multi-momentum phase retrieval algorithm\nprovided in this work, a single meta-transformer is able to sup-\nport 5 OAM states ranging from −8 to 8 or 6 LM states in\nthe visible region (Supplementary Note 8). With the help of\nthe polarization-dependent response\n21,42,43 of TiO2 nano-ﬁns, the\nnumber of patterns encoded in a meta-transformer can increase\nto 9 for OAM or 11 for LM. Furthermore, the capability of a\nmeta-transformer can also be improved by increasing the number\nof units25, and widening the multi-momentum state region.\nBesides, by considering the donut shapes of vortex beams,\nintroducing random phase mask44, and combining the LM and\nf\nSimulationExperiment\ne\nc\nZ0\nZ0\nSimulationExperiment\nd\n0\n800\nEfficiency (%)\nWavelength (nm)\n400 500 600 700\n80\n40\n60\n20\nb\np\na\nTiO2\nQuartz\nl\nw\nSide view Top view\nTiO2 h\nQuartz\nl (1) = – 5\nl (1) = – 5\nl (2) = + 5\nl (2) = + 5\nk0\n(R) k0\n(G) k0\n(B)\nk0\n(B)\nk0\n(G)\nk0\n(R)\nh (k0\n(B))\nh (k0\n(G))\nh (k0\n(R))\n/afii9850\nFig. 2Principle and demonstration of multi-momentum meta-transformer.a Geometry of the designed unit cell structure representing one pixel in the meta-\ntransformer, with the periodicity of 325 nm.

These two momentum degrees of freedom, in\nprinciple lead to inﬁnite combined states, which enables meta-\nsurface with a large number of functions and may lead to new\nopportunities in 3D imaging, anti-counterfeiting, optical com-\nmunication, and real-time detection.\nMethods\nNumerical simulation. The amorphous TiO2 nano-ﬁns were optimized by\nLumerical FDTD Solution (a commercial software). In this simulation, TiO2 nano-\nﬁns with measured refractive index were placed on quartz substrate. Two sources\npolarized along x- and y-axes with a 90° phase shift was used to form the right\ncircularly polarized incident beam, and this beam illuminated TiO2 nano-ﬁns from\nthe substrate side. The periodic boundary condition was used alongx- and y-\ndirections, and the perfect matched layer (PML) was chosen alongz-direction.\nData availability\nThe data that support theﬁndings of this study are available from the corresponding\nauthor upon reasonable request.\nCode availability\nThe codes that support the plots within this paper and otherﬁndings of this study are\navailable from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.\nReceived: 29 April 2019; Accepted: 11 September 2019;\nReferences\n1.
