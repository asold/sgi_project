  "abstract": "We investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment\\nanalysis of U.S. financial news and their potential in predicting stock market\\nreturns. We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from\\nJanuary 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs,\\nincluding BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary\\nmodel, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The\\nstudy documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent\\ndaily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the\\nhighest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly\\nahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald\\ndictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1%\\naccuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model\\nscores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in\\ndifferent model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive\\nrelevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant\\nrelationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock\\nreturns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current\\nfinancial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels\\nwith a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT\\nlong-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary\\nyield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior\\nperformance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction\\nand portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of\\nfinancial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy\\nanalysis.\\n",
