Therefore,\ngraph representation learning has become a hot topic in pat-\ntern recognition and machine learning [Cai and Lam, 2020;\nYing et al., 2021; Brossard et al., 2020].\nWith the development of deep learning, many methods\nhave been developed for graph representation learning [Per-\nozzi et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2019; Ying et al., 2021;\nHussain et al., 2021; Ramp ´aˇsek et al., 2022 ]. In general,\nthese methods can be approximately divided into two parts.\nThe first category mainly focuses on performing Graph Neu-\nral Networks (GNNs) on graph data. These methods follow\nthe convolutional pattern to define the convolution operation\n(a) Node-to-Node (b) Node-to-Edge (c) Edge-to-Node\nNode Edge Node Embedding Edge Embedding\nFigure 1: Illustration of the three ways for graph information propa-\ngation. Circles and black lines indicate nodes and edges, and green\nand pink cubes represent node embeddings and edge embeddings.\nOur GPTrans achieves better graph representation learning by ex-\nplicitly constructing three ways for information propagation in the\nproposed Graph Propagation Attention (GPA) module, including (a)\nnode-to-node, (b) node-to-edge, and (c) edge-to-node.\nin the graph data, and design effective neighborhood aggrega-\ntion schemes to learn node representations by fusing the node\nand graph topology information. The representative method\nis Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) [Kipf and Welling,\n2016], which learns the representation of a node in the graph\nby considering fusing its neighbors. After that, many GCN\nvariants [Xu et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a;\nBresson and Laurent, 2017 ] containing different neighbor-\nhood aggregation schemes have been developed. The second\nkind of method is to build graph models based on the trans-\nformer architecture. For example, Cai and Lam [2020] uti-\nlized the explicit relation encoding between nodes and fused\nthem into the encoder-decoder transformer network for ef-\nfective graph-to-sequence learning. Graphormer [Ying et al.,\n2021] established state-of-the-art performance on graph-level\nprediction tasks by transforming the structure and edge fea-\ntures of the graph into attention biases.\nAlthough recent transformer-based methods report promis-\ning performance for graph representation learning, they still\nsuffer the following problems. (1) Not explicitly employ the\nrelationship among nodes and edges in the graph data. Re-\ncent transformer-based methods [Cai and Lam, 2020; Ying\net al., 2021 ] only simply fuse nodes and edges information\nby using positional encodings. However, due to the complex-\nity of graph structure, how to fully employ the relationship\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n3559\namong nodes and edges for graph representation learning re-\nmains to be studied. (2) Inefficient dual-FFN structure in the\ntransformer block. Recent works resort to the dual-path struc-\nture in the transformer block to incorporate the edge informa-\ntion. For instance, the Edge-augmented Graph Transformer\n(EGT) [Hussain et al., 2021] adopted dual feed-forward net-\nworks (FFN) in the transformer block to update the edge em-\nbeddings, and let the structural information evolve from layer\nto layer. However, this paradigm learns the information of\nedges and nodes separately, which introduces more calcula-\ntions and easily leads to the low efficiency of the model.\nTo overcome these issues, we propose an efficient and\npowerful transformer architecture for graph learning, termed\nGraph Propagation Transformer (GPTrans). A key design el-\nement of GPTrans is its Graph Propagation Attention (GPA)\nmodule. As illustrated in Figure 1, the GPA module propa-\ngates the information among the node embeddings and edge\nembeddings of the preceding layer by modeling three con-\nnections, i.e., node-to-node, node-to-edge, and edge-to-node,\nwhich significantly enhances modeling capability (see Ta-\nble 1). This design benefits us no longer the need to maintain\nan FFN module specifically for edge embeddings, bringing\nhigher efficiency than previous dual-FFN methods.\nThe contributions of our work are as follows:\n(1) We propose an effective Graph Propagation Trans-\nformer (GPTrans), which can better model the relationship\namong nodes and edges and represent the graph.\n(2) We introduce a novel attention mechanism in the trans-\nformer blocks, which explicitly passes the information among\nnodes and edges in three ways. These relationships play a\ncritical role in graph representation learning.\n(3) Extensive experiments show that the proposed GPTrans\nmodel outperforms many state-of-the-art transformer-based\nmethods on benchmark datasets with better performance.\n2 Related Works\n2.1 Transformer\nThe past few years have seen many transformer-based mod-\nels designed for various language [Vaswani et al., 2017;\nRadford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020 ] and vision tasks\n[Parmar et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2021b]. For example, in the\nfield of vision, Dosovitskiy et al. [2021] presented the Vi-\nsion Transformer (ViT), which decomposed an image into\na sequence of patches and captured their mutual relation-\nships. However, training ViT on large-scale datasets can\nbe computationally expensive. To address this issue, DeiT\n[Touvron et al., 2021 ] proposed an efficient training strat-\negy that enabled ViT to deliver exceptional performance even\nwhen trained on smaller datasets. Nevertheless, the complex-\nity and performance of ViT remain challenging. To over-\ncome these limitations, researchers further proposed many\nwell-designed models [Liu et al., 2021b; Wang et al., 2021;\nWang et al., 2022a; Chen et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2023;\nChen et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b].\nRecently, the self-attention mechanism and transformer\narchitecture have been gradually introduced into the graph\nrepresentation learning tasks, such as graph-level prediction\n[Ying et al., 2021; Hussain et al., 2021], producing compet-\nitive performance compared to the traditional GNN models.\nThe early self-attention-based GNNs focused on adopting the\nattention mechanism to a local neighborhood of each node\nin a graph, or directly on the whole graph. For example,\nGraph Attention Network (GAT)[Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017] and\nGraph Transformer (GT) [Dwivedi and Bresson, 2020 ] uti-\nlized self-attention mechanisms as local constraints for the\nlocal neighborhood of each node. In contrast to employing\nlocal self-attention for graph learning, Graph-BERT [Zhang\net al., 2020 ] introduced the global self-attention mechanism\nin a revised transformer network to predict one masked node\nin a sampled subgraph.\nIn addition, several works have attempted to use the trans-\nformer architecture to tackle graph-related tasks directly. Two\nnotable examples are [Cai and Lam, 2020 ] and Graphormer\n[Ying et al., 2021 ]. The former method adopted explicit\nrelation encoding between nodes and integrated them into\nthe encoder-decoder transformer network, to enable graph-\nto-sequence learning. The latter mainly regarded the structure\nand edges of the graph as the attention biases, which were in-\ncorporated into the transformer block. With the help of these\nattention biases, Graphormer achieved leading performance\non graph-level prediction tasks (e.g.,classification and regres-\nsion on molecular graphs).\n2.2 Graph Convolutional Network\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a kind of deep neu-\nral network that extends the CNN from grid data (e.g., im-\nage and video) to graph-structured data. Generally speak-\ning, GCN methods can be approximately divided into two\ntypes: spectral-based methods [Bruna et al., 2013; Defferrard\net al., 2016; Henaff et al., 2015; Kipf and Welling, 2016] and\nnon-spectral methods [Chen et al., 2018; Gilmer et al., 2017;\nScarselli et al., 2008; Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017].\nSpectral GCN methods are designed under the theory of\nspectral graphs. For instance, Spectral GCN [Bruna et al.,\n2013] resorted to the Fourier basis of a graph to conduct con-\nvolution operation in the spectral domain, which is the first\nwork on spectral graph CNNs. Based on [Bruna et al., 2013],\nDefferrard et al. [2016] designed a strict control over the lo-\ncal support of filters and avoided an explicit use of the Graph\nFourier basis in the convolution, which achieved better accu-\nracy. Kipf and Welling[2016] adopted the first-order approx-\nimation of the spectral graph convolution to simplify com-\nmonly used GNN.\nOn the other hand, non-spectral methods directly define\nconvolution operations on the graph data. GraphSage[Hamil-\nton et al., 2017 ] proposed learnable aggregator functions in\nthe network to fuse neighbors’ information for effective graph\nrepresentation learning. In GAT[Veliˇckovi´c et al., 2017], dif-\nferent weight matrices are used for nodes with different de-\ngrees for graph representation learning. In addition, another\nline of GCN methods is mainly designed for specific graph-\nlevel tasks. For example, some techniques such as subsam-\npling [Chen et al., 2017 ] and inductive representation for a\nlarge graph [Hamilton et al., 2017] have been introduced for\nbetter graph representative learning.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n3560\nHead\nTransformer BlocksGraph\nGraph PropagationAttentionGraphEmbedding𝑥!\"#$\n𝑥$#%$\n×𝐿Feed-ForwardNetwork\nFigure 2: Overall architecture of GPTrans. It contains a graph embedding layer,L transformer blocks, and a head. The graph embedding layer\ntransforms the graph data into node embeddings xnode and edge embeddings xedge, as the input of the transformer blocks. Each transformer\nblock comprises a Graph Propagation Attention (GPA) and a Feed-Forward Network (FFN). It is worth noting that we no longer need to\nmaintain an FFN module specifically for edge embeddings due to the proposed GPA module, which improves the efficiency of our method.\nFinally, a head of two fully-connected layers is employed on the output embeddings for various graph tasks.\n3 GPTrans\n3.1 Overall Architecture\nAn overview of the proposed GPTrans framework is depicted\nin Figure 2. Specifically, it takes a graphG = (V, E) as input,\nin which nodes V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, E indicates edges be-\ntween nodes, and n means the number of nodes. The pipeline\nof GPTrans can be divided into three parts: graph embedding,\ntransformer blocks, and prediction head.\nIn the graph embedding layer, for each given graph G, we\nfollow [Ying et al., 2021; Hussainet al., 2021] to add a virtual\nnode [v0] into V , to aggregate the information of the entire\ngraph. Thus, the newly-generated node set with the virtual\nnode is represented as V ′ = {[v0], v1, v2, . . . , vn}, and the\nnumber of nodes is updated to |V ′| = 1 +n. For more ad-\nequate information propagation across the whole graph, each\nnode and edge is treated as a token. In detail, we trans-\nform the input nodes into a sequence of node embeddings\nxnode ∈ R(1+n)×d1 , and encode the input edges into a tensor\nof edge embeddings xedge ∈ R(1+n)×(1+n)×d2 .\nThen, L transformer blocks with our re-designed self-\nattention operation (i.e., Graph Propagation Attention) are ap-\nplied to node embeddings and edge embeddings. Both these\nembeddings are fed throughout all transformer blocks. After\nthat, GPTrans generates the representation of each node and\nedge, in which the output embedding of the virtual node takes\nalong the representation of the whole graph.\nFinally, the head of our GPTrans is composed of two fully-\nconnected (FC) layers. For graph-level tasks, we employ it\non top of the output embedding of the virtual node. For node-\nlevel or edge(link)-level tasks, we apply it to the output node\nembeddings or edge embeddings. In summary, benefiting\nfrom the proposed novel Graph Propagation Attention, our\nGPTrans can better support various graph tasks with only a\nlittle additional computational cost compared to the previous\nmethod Graphormer [Ying et al., 2021].\n3.2 Graph Embedding\nThe role of the graph embedding layer is to transform the\ngraph data as the input of transformer blocks. As we know,\nin addition to the nodes, edges also have rich structural infor-\nmation in many types of graphs,e.g., molecular graphs [Hu et\nal., 2021] and social graphs [Huang et al., 2022]. Therefore,\nwe encode both nodes and edges into embeddings to fully\nutilize the structure of the input graph.\nFor nodes in the graph, we transform each node into node\nembedding. Specifically, we follow [Ying et al. , 2021 ] to\nexploit the node attributes and the degree information, and\nadd a virtual node [v0] into the graph to collect and prop-\nagate graph-level features. Without loss of generality, tak-\ning a directed graph as an example, its node embeddings\nxnode ∈ R(1+n)×d1 can be expressed as:\nxnode = xnode attr + xdeg− + xdeg+ , (1)\nwhere xnode attr, xdeg−, and xdeg+ are embeddings encoded\nfrom node attributes, indegree, and outdegree statistics, re-\nspectively. d1 is the dimension of node embeddings.\nFor edges in the graph, we also transform them into\nedge embeddings to help the learning of graph representa-\ntion. In our implementation, the edge embeddings xedge ∈\nR(1+n)×(1+n)×d2 are defined as:\nxedge = xedge attr + xrel pos, (2)\nwhere xedge attr is encoded from the edge attributes, and\nxrel pos is a relative positional encoding that embeds the spa-\ntial location of node pairs. d2 means the dimension of edge\nembeddings. We adopt the encoding of the shortest path dis-\ntance by default following [Ying et al., 2021]. In other words,\nfor the position (i, j), xij\nedge ∈ Rd2 represents the learned\nstructural embedding of the edge (path) between node vi and\nnode vj in the graph G.\nIt is worth noting that, unlike Graphormer [Ying et al. ,\n2021] that encodes edge attributes and spatial position as at-\ntention biases and shares them across all blocks, we optimize\nthe edge embeddings xedge in each transformer block by the\nproposed Graph Propagation Attention. Then, the updated\nedge embeddings are fed into the next block. Therefore, each\nblock of our model could adaptively learn different ways to\nexploit edge features and propagate information. This more\nflexible way is beneficial for graph representation learning,\nwhich we will show in later experiments.\n3.3 Graph Propagation Attention\nIn recent years, many works [Ying et al. , 2021; Shi et al. ,\n2022; Hussain et al., 2021] show global self-attention could\nserve as a flexible alternative to graph convolution and help\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n3561\nNode Embeddings Edge Embeddings\n𝑊!𝑊\" 𝑊#\nProduct & Scale\n𝑊$%&'(%\nSoftmax\n𝑊%)*+,&\nSoftmax\nSum & FC 𝑊-\n(c) \n(b)\n(a)\n𝑄 𝐾 𝑉 ∅\n𝐴\n𝑥,-&%\n.\n𝑥%&/%\n.\n𝑥,-&%\n.. 𝑥,-&%\n... 𝑥%&/%\n.\nFigure 3: Illustration of Graph Propagation Attention. It explicitly\nbuilds three paths for information propagation among node embed-\ndings and edge embeddings, including (a) node-to-node, (b) node-\nto-edge, and (c) edge-to-node.\nbetter graph representation learning. However, most of them\nonly consider part of the information propagation paths in\ngraph, or introduce a lot of extra computational overhead to\nutilize edge information. For instance, Graphormer [Ying\net al., 2021 ] only used edge features as shared bias terms\nto refine the attention weights of nodes. GT [Dwivedi and\nBresson, 2020 ] and EGT [Hussain et al., 2021 ] designed\ndual-FFN networks to fuse edge features. Inspired by this,\nwe introduce Graph Propagation Attention (GPA), as an ef-\nficient replacement for vanilla self-attention in graph trans-\nformers. With an affordable cost, it could support three types\nof propagation paths, including node-to-node, node-to-edge,\nand edge-to-node. For simplicity of description, we consider\nsingle-head self-attention in the following formulas.\nNode-to-Node\nFollowing common practices [Ying et al., 2021; Shi et al.,\n2022; Hussain et al., 2021 ], we adopt global self-attention\n[Vaswani et al., 2017 ] to perform node-to-node propaga-\ntion. First, we use parameter matrices WQ, WK, and WV ∈\nRd1×d1 to project the node embeddings xnode to queries Q,\nkeys K, and values V :\nQ = xnodeWQ, K = xnodeWK, V = xnodeWV. (3)\nUnlike Graphormer [Ying et al., 2021 ] that used shared at-\ntention biases in all blocks, we employ a parameter matrix\nWreduce ∈ Rd2×nhead to predict layer-specific attention bi-\nases ϕ ∈ R(1+n)×(1+n)×nhead from the edge embeddings\nxedge, which can be written as:\nϕ = xedgeWreduce. (4)\nThen, we add ϕ to the attention map of the query-key dot\nproduct and compute the output node embeddings x′\nnode.\nThis process can be formulated as:\nA = QKT\n√dhead\n+ ϕ, x ′\nnode = softmax(A)V, (5)\nwhere A ∈ R(1+n)×(1+n)×nhead represents the output atten-\ntion map, and dhead refers to the dimension of each head. In\nsummary, sinceϕ are projected from higher dimensional edge\nembeddings by the learnable matrix, our attention mapA will\nhave more flexible patterns to aggregate node features.\nNode-to-Edge\nTo propagate node features to edges, we make some addi-\ntional use of the attention map A. According to the defini-\ntion of self-attention [Vaswani et al., 2017], attention map A\ncaptures the similarity between node embeddings. Therefore,\nconsidering both local and global connections, we addA with\nits softmax confidence, and expand its dimension to as same\nas xedge through the learnable matrix Wexpand ∈ Rnhead×d2 .\nThis operation is designed to perform explicit high-order spa-\ntial interactions, which can be written as follows:\nx′\nedge = (A + softmax(A))Wexpand. (6)\nIn this way, we achieve node-to-edge propagation without re-\nlying on an additional FFN module like GT [Dwivedi and\nBresson, 2020] and EGT [Hussain et al., 2021].\nEdge-to-Node\nIn this part, we delve into the following question: How to\ngenerate dynamic weights for edge embeddings xedge and\nfuse them into node embeddings xnode? Due to the compu-\ntational efficiency, we do not additionally perform attention\noperation, but directly apply the softmax function to the just\ngenerated x′\nedge ∈ R(1+n)×(1+n)×d2 in Eqn. 6 and calculate\nelement-wise product with itself:\nx′′\nnode = FC(sum(x′\nedge · softmax(x′\nedge), dim = 1)), (7)\nin which the fully-connected (FC) layer is used to align the\ndimension of edge embeddings and node embeddings. This\nprocess again explicitly introduces high-order spatial interac-\ntions. Finally, we add these two types of node embeddings,\nand employ a learnable matrix WO ∈ Rd1×d1 to fuse them.\nThen we have the updated node embeddings:\nx′′′\nnode = (x′\nnode + x′′\nnode)WO. (8)\nGPA in Transformer Blocks\nEquipped with our proposed GPA module, the block of our\nGPTrans can be calculated as follows:\nˆxl\nnode, xl\nedge += GPA(LN(xl−1\nnode), xl−1\nedge), (9)\nxl\nnode = FFN(LN(ˆxl\nnode)) + ˆxl\nnode, (10)\nwhere LN(·) means layer normalization [Ba et al., 2016 ].\nˆxl\nnode and xl\nedge denote the output node embeddings and edge\nembeddings of the GPA module for blockl. And xl\nnode repre-\nsents the output node embeddings of the FFN module. Over-\nall, our GPA module effectively extends the ability of our\nGPTrans to various graph tasks, but only introduces a small\namount of extra overhead compared with previous methods\n[Hussain et al., 2021; Ying et al., 2021].\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n3562\nPCQM4M↓ PCQM4Mv2↓\nModel #Param Validate Test Validate Test-dev\nNon-transformer-based Methods\nGCN 2.0M 0.1684 0.1838 0.1379 0.1398\nGIN 3.8M 0.1536 0.1678 0.1195 0.1218\nGCN-VN 4.9M 0.1510 0.1579 0.1153 0.1152\nGIN-VN 6.7M 0.1396 0.1487 0.1083 0.1084\nGINE-VN 13.2M 0.1430 − − −\nDeeperGCN-VN 25.5M 0.1398 − − −\nTransformer-based Methods\nGPS-Small 6.2M − − 0.0938 −\nGPTrans-T (ours) 6.6M 0.1179 − 0.0833 −\nGraphormer-S 12.5M 0.1264 − 0.0910 −\nEGT-Small 11.5M 0.1260 − 0.0899 −\nGPS-Medium 19.4M − − 0.0858 −\nGPTrans-S (ours) 13.6M 0.1162 − 0.0823 −\nTokenGT 48.5M − − 0.0910 −\nGraphormer-B 47.1M 0.1234 − 0.0906 −\nGRPE-Standard 46.2M 0.1225 − 0.0890 0.0898\nEGT-Medium 47.4M 0.1224 − 0.0881 −\nGPTrans-B (ours) 45.7M 0.1153 − 0.0813 −\nGT-Wide 83.2M 0.1408 − − −\nGraphormerV2-L 159.3M 0.1228 − 0.0883 −\nEGT-Large 89.3M − − 0.0869 0.0872\nEGT-Larger 110.8M − − 0.0859 −\nGRPE-Large 118.3M − − 0.0867 0.0876\nGPS-Deep 138.1M − − 0.0852 0.0862\nGPTrans-L (ours) 86.0M 0.1151 − 0.0809 0.0821\nTable 1: Results on PCQM4M and PCQM4Mv2.

The task is to regress a DFT-calculated\nquantum chemical property,e.g., HOMO-LUMO energy gap.\n(2) PCQM4Mv2 [Hu et al., 2021 ] is an updated version of\nPCQM4M, in which the number of molecules slightly de-\ncreased, and some of the graphs are revised.\n(3) MolHIV [Hu et al., 2020] is a small-scale molecular prop-\nerty prediction dataset. It has 41, 127 graphs with a total of\n1, 048, 738 nodes and 1, 130, 993 edges.\n(4) MolPCBA [Hu et al., 2020] is another property prediction\ndataset, which is larger than MolHIV .

Following common\npractice, we adopt a cosine decay learning rate scheduler with\na 20-epoch warmup. All models are trained for 300 epochs\nwith a total batch size of 1024. When fine-tuning the MolHIV\nand MolPCBA datasets, we load the PCQM4Mv2 pre-trained\nweights as initialization. For the ZINC dataset, we train our\nGPTrans-Nano model from scratch. More detailed training\nstrategies are provided in the appendix.\nResults\nFirst, we benchmark our GPTrans method on PCQM4M and\nPCQM4Mv2, two datasets from OGB large-scale challenge\n[Hu et al., 2021 ]. We mainly compare our GPTrans against\na set of representative transformer-based methods, including\nGT [Dwivedi and Bresson, 2020 ], Graphormer [Ying et al.,\n2021], GRPE [Park et al., 2022], EGT [Hussain et al., 2021],\nGPS [Ramp´aˇsek et al., 2022 ], and TokenGT [Kim et al.,\n2022]. As reported in Table 1, our method yields the state-of-\nthe-art validate MAE score on both datasets across different\nmodel complexities.\nFurther, we take the PCQM4Mv2 pre-trained weights as\nthe initialization and fine-tune our models on the OGB molec-\nular datasets MolPCBA and MolHIV , to verify the transfer\nlearning capability of GPTrans. All experiments are per-\nformed five times with different random seeds, and we report\nthe mean and standard deviation of the results. From Table 2\nand 3, we can see that GPTrans outperforms many strong\ncounterparts, such as GRPE [Park et al., 2022 ], EGT [Hus-\nsain et al., 2021], and Graphormer [Ying et al., 2021].\nMoreover, we follow previous methods [Park et al., 2022;\nYing et al., 2021 ] to train the GPTrans-Nano model with\nabout 500K parameters on the ZINC subset from scratch. As\ndemonstrated in Table 4, our model achieves a promising test\nMAE of 0.077 ± 0.009, bringing 36.9% relative MAE de-\ncline compared to Graphormer [Ying et al., 2021]. The above\ninspiring results show that the proposed GPTrans performs\nwell on graph-level tasks.\n4.2 Node-Level Tasks\nDatasets\nPATTERN and CLUSTER [Dwivedi et al., 2020 ] are both\nsynthetic datasets for node classification. Specifically, PAT-\nTERN has 10, 000 training, 2, 000 validation, and 2, 000 test\ngraphs, and CLUSTER contains 10, 000 training, 1, 000 vali-\ndation, and 1, 000 test graphs.\nSettings\nFor the PATTERN and CLUSTER datasets, we train our\nGPTrans-Nano up to 1000 epochs with a batch size of 256.\nWe employ the AdamW [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2018 ] op-\ntimizer with a 20-epoch warmup. The learning rate is ini-\ntialized to 5e-4, and is declined by a cosine scheduler. More\ntraining details can be found in the appendix.\nResults\nIn this part, we compare our GPTrans-Nano with various\nGCN variants and recent graph transformers. As shown in\nTable 4, our GPTrans-Nano produces the promising accuracy\nof 86.731 ± 0.085% and 78.069 ± 0.154% on the PATTERN\nand CLUSTER datasets, respectively. These results out-\nperform many Convolutional/Message-Passing Graph Neu-\nral Networks by large margins, showing that the proposed\nGPTrans can serve as an alternative to traditional GCNs for\nnode-level tasks. Moreover, we find that our method exceeds\nGraphormer [Ying et al., 2021 ] on the CLUSTER dataset\nby significant gaps of 3.4% accuracy, which suggests that\nthe three propagation ways explicitly constructed in the GPA\nmodule are also helpful for node-level tasks.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n3564\nModel #Param FLOPs Validate MAE↓\nBaseline (Graphormer-S) 12.5M 0.399G 0.0928\n+ Node-to-Node 13.3M 0.402G 0.0874\n++ Node-to-Edge 13.3M 0.405G 0.0865\n+++ Edge-to-Node 13.5M 0.417G 0.0854\nGPTrans-Swider 13.5M 0.417G 0.0854\nGPTrans-Sdeeper (ours) 13.6M 0.472G 0.0835\nTable 5: Ablation studies of GPTrans. We build our baseline based\non Graphormer-S [Ying et al., 2021] with a shorter schedule of 100\nepochs, and decline its validate MAE on PCQM4Mv2 [Hu et al.,\n2021] dataset from 0.0928 to 0.0854 by gradually introducing our\nGPA module. Moreover, we find that the deeper model outperforms\nthe wider model with a similar number of parameters.\n4.3 Edge-Level Tasks\nDatasets\nTSP [Dwivedi et al., 2020 ] is a dataset for the Traveling\nSalesman Problem, which is an NP-hard combinatorial op-\ntimization problem. The problem is reduced to a binary edge\nclassification task, where edges in the TSP tour have positive\nlabels. TSP dataset has 10, 000 training, 1, 000 validation,\nand 1, 000 test graphs.\nSettings\nWe experiment on the TSP dataset in a similar setting to that\nused in the PATTERN and CLUSTER datasets. Details are\nshown in the appendix.\nResults\nTable 4 compares the edge classification performance of\nour GPTrans-Nano model and previously transformer-based\nmethods on the TSP dataset. We observe GPTrans can outper-\nform Graphormer [Ying et al., 2021] with a large margin and\nis comparable with EGT [Hussain et al., 2021], showing that\nthe proposed GPA module design is competitive when used\nfor edge-level tasks. By applying the GPA module, we avoid\ndesigning an inefficient dual-FFN network, which boosts the\nefficiency of our method. We will analyze the efficiency of\nGPTrans in detail in Section 4.4.\n4.4 Ablation Study\nWe conduct several ablation studies on the PCQM4Mv2 [Hu\net al., 2021] dataset, to validate the effectiveness of each key\ndesign in our GPTrans. Due to the limited computational re-\nsources, we adopt GPTrans-S as the base model, and train it\nwith a shorter schedule of 100 epochs. Other settings are the\nsame as described in Section 4.1.\nGraph Propagation Attention\nTo investigate the contribution of each key design in our GPA\nmodule, we gradually extend the Graphormer baseline [Ying\net al., 2021] to our GPTrans. As shown in Table 5, the model\ngives the best performance when all three information prop-\nagation paths are introduced. It is worth noting that the im-\nprovement from our node-to-node propagation is most signif-\nicant, thanks to learning the attention biases for a particular\nlayer rather than sharing them across all layers. In summary,\nour proposed GPA module collectively brings a large gain to\nTrain Inference PCQM4Mv2\nModel #Param (min / ep.)

These experiments are\nconducted with PyTorch1.12 and CUDA11.3. Training time is mea-\nsured on 8 A100 GPUs with half-precision training, and the infer-\nence throughput is tested on a single A100 GPU.\nGraphormer, i.e., 8.0% relative validate MAE decline on the\nPCQM4Mv2 dataset.\nDeeper vs. Wider\nHere we explore the question of whether the transformers for\ngraph representation learning should go deeper or wider. For\nfair comparisons, we build a deeper but thinner model un-\nder comparable parameter numbers, by increasing the depth\nfrom 6 to 12 layers and decreasing the width from 512 to 384\ndimensions. As reported in Table 5, the validate MAE of the\nPCQM4Mv2 dataset is declined from 0.0854 to 0.0835 by the\ndeeper model, which shows that depth is more important than\nwidth for graph transformers. Based on this observation, we\nprefer to develop GPTrans with a large model depth.\nEfficiency Analysis\nAs shown in Table 6, we benchmark the training time and\ninference throughputs of our GPTrans and EGT [Hussain\net al., 2021 ]. Specifically, we employ PyTorch1.12 and\nCUDA11.3 to perform these experiments. For a fair com-\nparison, the training time of these two methods is measured\nusing 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs with half-precision training and\na total batch size of 1024. The inference throughputs of\nPCQM4Mv2 models in Table 6 are tested using an A100 GPU\nwith a batch size of 128, where our GPTrans is slightly faster\nin inference than EGT under a similar number of parameters.\nThis preliminary study shows a good signal that the proposed\nGPTrans, equipped with the GPA module, could be an effi-\ncient model for graph representation learning.\n5 Conclusion\nThis paper aims for graph representation learning with a\nGraph Propagation Transformer (GPTrans), which explores\nthe information propagation among nodes and edges in a\ngraph when establishing the self-attention mechanism in the\ntransformer block. Especially in the GPTrans, we propose a\nGraph Propagation Attention (GPA) mechanism to explicitly\npass the information among nodes and edges in three ways,\ni.e., node-to-node, node-to-edge, and edge-to-node, which is\nessential for learning graph-structured data. Extensive com-\nparisons with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the superior capability of the proposed\nGPTrans with better performance.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n3565\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of\nChina under Grant 61672273 and Grant 61832008.\nContribution Statement\nZhe Chen and Hao Tan contributed equally to this work and\nare listed as co-first authors.
