Our ex-\nperiments on three LLMs using two challeng-\ning frameworks demonstrate that SALAM can\nsignificantly boost LLMs by an accuracy mar-\ngin of up to 6.6 on BBH and 12.6 on BBQ 1.\n1 Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demon-\nstrated remarkable performance in a wide range\nof tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020;\nChowdhery et al., 2022). Their effectiveness is\nfurther enhanced by human instructions and feed-\nback, allowing them to better align with human\nintentions (Chung et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022;\nBai et al., 2022b). Furthermore, recent studies\nshow that LLMs can also benefit from their own\nfeedback to avoid mistakes, similar to human re-\nflection (Shinn et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023).\nThere are two main limitations to existing self-\nreflection methods. First, they rely on the correct-\nness of the guidance, particularly in determining\n1https://dqwang122.github.io/projects/SALAM.\nJane thought today is 3/11/2002, but today is in fact Mar 12, which is 1 day later.

What is the datetoday?\nMistakeGatheringExamination\nMistake Memory\nLabel\nRetrieve\nFigure 1: SALAM consists of two agents: a main LLM and a\nstudy assistant. The main LLM generates responses (in blue),\nwhile the study assistant provides guidance (in green). During\nthe mistake-gathering phase, the main LLM interacts with the\nstudy assistant, receiving feedback to refine its responses. The\nstudy assistant compares the main LLM’s response with the\nground truth, providing guidance and collecting the mistakes\nmade by the main LLM. In the examination phase, the study\nassistant retrieves relevant mistakes from the mistake memory\nfor a new query and provides guidelines without knowing the\nground truth.\nwhen to terminate reflection and accept the cur-\nrent response. Inaccurate guidance can mislead the\nLLM by either prompting it to refine an already\nacceptable generation or prematurely halting the re-\nfinement of an undesired generation (Huang et al.,\n2023). Prior studies have attempted to address this\nby utilizing additional learned discriminators and\nemploying a value-based threshold as the termina-\ntion signal (Welleck et al., 2022; Saunders et al.,\n2022; Lu et al., 2022), or by providing few-shot\nexamples to encourage LLMs to develop their own\ndiscernment when accepting responses (Madaan\net al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022; Kwon et al., 2023).\nHowever, the reliability of such criteria remains\nuncertain. Moreover, the reflection methods are\nlimited to the unsuccessful experiences of the query\nthey are addressing, without acknowledging mis-\ntakes made on other queries. Consequently, when\nconfronted with a new query, the LLM cannot fully\n10667\nutilize the experience gained from similar cases\nand may repeat past errors. The lack of global\nreflection results in an inefficient revision process.\nTo address these challenges, we propose Study\nAssistant for Large LAnguage Model (SALAM).\nThis novel framework introduces a cooperative\nagent, guiding the main LLM to learn from its\nmistakes. It is inspired by how humans learn from\ntheir mistakes: maintaining a collection of mis-\ntakes and analyzing common misunderstandings.\nSALAM includes two cooperative agents: a main\nLLM responsible for problem-solving, and a study\nassistant that collects previous error cases and pro-\nvides guidance to improve the main LLM’s per-\nformance. The framework consists of two phases:\nthe mistake-gathering phase and the examination\nphase. During the mistake-gathering phase, the\nLLM interacts with the study assistant to receive\nfeedback and refine its answers. Simultaneously,\nthe study assistant collects mistakes and provides\nguidance based on the ground truth. In the exam-\nination phase, the study assistant retrieves simi-\nlar mistakes for a new query and provides guide-\nlines to clarify misunderstandings and prevent the\nLLM from repeating previous errors. For exam-\nple, in Figure 1, the study assistant analyzes the\nLLM’s current response of ‘02/11/2002’ compared\nto the ground truth of ‘02/12/2002’ and provides\nthe guideline ‘identify the correct date from which\ncalculations should be made’ to help the LLM re-\nfine its response.\nOur proposed SALAM enjoys three advantages:\n(1) Flexible: SALAM is a versatile framework\nthat can be directly adapted to any LLM. Addi-\ntionally, it has the capability to provide LLM-\nspecific guidance by fine-tuning the study assis-\ntant on the specific behaviors of the LLM. (2)\nLightweight: In contrast to knowledge distillation,\nwhere a large teacher/teacher assistant is used to\nimprove downstream task performance, the study\nassistant in SALAM is a small model focused on\nproviding feedback based on mistakes. It is more\ncost-effective to fine-tune the small study assistant\nonce for all downstream tasks, compared to fine-\ntuning the large LLM for different complex tasks.\n(3) Efficient and Reliable: The feedback provided\nby the study assistant is based on the comparison\nbetween the LLM’s response and the ground truth,\nmaking feedback more reliable. Furthermore, the\nguidance for previous mistakes can be applied to\nnew, similar queries. This makes the guidance\nmore efficient, as it can help prevent similar errors\nfrom occurring in advance.\nWe evaluate the effectiveness of SALAM on\nthree LLMs: Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2022), GPT-\nNeoX (Black et al., 2022), and LLaMA (Touvron\net al., 2023). We use 27 tasks from BBH (Suzgun\net al., 2022) and BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022), which\nevaluate two crucial aspects of LLMs: reasoning\nability and potential social bias. Our contributions\nare as follows:\n• We introduce a general framework, SALAM, to\nlearn from mistakes through interactive coopera-\ntion between the main LLM and the study assis-\ntant. The main LLM refines its answer based on\nthe feedback from the study assistant, while the\nstudy assistant provides guidance by comparing\nthe LLM’s behaviors with the ground truth.\n• We further use the main LLM to fine-tune a\nmodel-specific study assistant, tailoring the spe-\ncific guidance for this LLM. We use imitation\nlearning on the successful guidance experiences\nof this LLM for fine-tuning.\n• The experimental results show SALAM signifi-\ncantly boosts the performance of various LLMs\non different tasks. We also conduct a comprehen-\nsive analysis of retrieval and feedback strategies.\n2 Related Work\nFeedback from Language ModelsLarge language\nmodels (LLMs) have exhibited a remarkable capa-\nbility for providing feedback. The feedback from\nLLMs can be in the form of real numbers to eval-\nuate the quality of the generation (Fu et al., 2023;\nKocmi and Federmann, 2023), or textual instruc-\ntion to guide the refinement (Kwon et al., 2023;\nYao et al., 2022). For instance, Peng et al. (2023)\nprovided feedback grounded in evidence from ex-\nternal knowledge. Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023)\ngenerated textual feedback utilizing trajectory his-\ntory and dynamic memory with the help of few-\nshot examples and the signal from the environment.\nSelf-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) manually created\nseveral few-shot examples for each task to prompt\nLLM to provide feedback. It stops reflection when\nit achieves the maximum iteration or exceeds the\nthreshold value. Du et al. (2023) uses responses\nfrom multiple agents and the debate between these\nagents as the feedback. However, Huang et al.\n(2023) finds that such intrinsic self-correction is un-\nreliable without the correct label to determine when\nto stop the refinement. Instead of previous instance-\n10668\nspecific feedback, in this paper, the study assistant\ncollects a set of mistakes to generate global feed-\nback on model behaviors. Furthermore, the study\nassistant used the ground truth to provide feedback,\nmaking the feedback more reliable.\nLearning from Feedback Plenty of work has\nbeen done to investigate how to utilize feed-\nback (Pan et al., 2023). One is to filter undesirable\ndata based on feedback and use the filtered data\nto finetune the model (Huang et al., 2022; Uesato\net al., 2022). The other is to train a reward function\nand take it as the reward function in the reinforce-\nment learning (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al.,\n2022; Bai et al., 2022a). Benefiting the LLMs’ abil-\nity to follow instructions, recent researchers add\ntextual feedback into the prompt and directly ask\nmodels to revise their response (Peng et al., 2023;\nShinn et al., 2023). Moreover, the feedback can\nbe one time (Saunders et al., 2022), or multiple\ntimes (Scheurer et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023).\nIn this work, we use feedback as the instruction of\nthe main LLM and ask it to refine its answer.\nTeacher-student Learning Teacher-student\nlearning is a knowledge distillation method to trans-\nfer knowledge from a larger teacher model to a\nsmaller student model (Hinton et al., 2015; Gou\net al., 2021). The goal is to produce similar re-\nsults as the powerful teacher model with fewer\nparameters and computational costs. The teaching\nassistant is an intermediate model mimicking the\nbehavior of the teacher model and then teaches the\nstudent model. It usually has a medium size be-\ntween the student and the teacher (Mirzadeh et al.,\n2020). Recently, a lot of work has tried to distill\nknowledge in large language models to enhance\nthe capability of small models, such as common-\nsense (Bhagavatula et al., 2023; West et al., 2022)\nand the reasoning ability (Shridhar et al., 2023;\nMagister et al., 2022). Unlike knowledge distilla-\ntion, the study assistant in SALAM does not need\na stronger capability on the downstream tasks. It is\ndesigned to analyze the output of the base model\ngiven the ground truth, providing a guideline for\nthe base model to avoid similar mistakes.\n3 Study Assistant Agent for LLMs\nIn this section, we introduce SALAM framework.\nSALAM consists of two agents: a main LLM M\nand a study assistant T. The Mis responsible for\nsolving the downstream tasks while the study assis-\ntant T provides text feedback for Mto refine its\nanswer. The goal of this framework is to improve\nMperformance by the interactive cooperation be-\ntween the two agents.\nThere are two phases: in the gathering phase,\nthe study assistant T collects mistakes while iden-\ntifying common misunderstandings and provid-\ning helpful guidance for revision; the examination\nphase involves using Mon new queries. The key\ndifference is that in the gathering phase, the study\nassistant T has access to the ground truth, while in\nthe examination phase, it does not.\nSpecifically, suppose there is a set of N queries\nQ= {q(0),q(1),··· ,q(N)}in the gathering phase.\nFor each query q ∈Q, the main LLM Mgener-\nates an initial response y0 and the study assistant T\nprovides text feedback a0 based on the comparison\nbetween the current response and the ground truth\n˜y. Then Mgenerates a new response y1 under the\nguidance of the feedback. There can be multiple\niterations between these two agents until Mgets\nthe correct answer (or achieves the maximum iter-\nation number L): {(y0,a0),··· ,(yl,al)}. These\niterations are stored in the mistake memory Oerr.\nDuring the examination phase, given a new query\nq, the study assistant T retrieves the most relevant\nqueries from Oerr and provides text feedback as\nthe pre-hoc instruction for M.\n3.1 Problem Formulation\nWe formulate the interactive process as a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) with (S,A,P,R). Here, S\nrepresents a set of states describing the interaction\nwhile A represents a set of feedback generated by\nthe study assistant T. P is transition probability\nfunction: S×A×S →[0,1], and R :S×A→R is\na reward function based on the states and feedback.\nFor each state st, the study assistant T generates\nthe text feedback as its action at and receives a\nreward based on M’s performance.\nThe state at timestep t is defined as st =\n{q,yt,ct}, including a query q, a response yt gen-\nerated by M, and the context ct retrieved from the\nmistake memory Oerr. In the gathering phase, the\ncontext ct is previous responses for the same query\nct = {(q,y0:(t−1))}; in the examination phase, it\nincludes retrieved mistakes and feedback of rele-\nvant queries based on the query similarity: ct =\n{(q(1),y(1)\n0:t(1) ,a(1)\n0:t(1) ),(q(2),y(2)\n0:t(2) ,a(2)\n0:t(2) ),···}\nThe action space A is a set of all possible feed-\nback utterances generated by T. It includes an\nexplanation about why yt is incorrect (Analysis)\n10669\nand a suggestion for improvement (Guideline). We\nuse the performance of Mas the reward function\nR(st,at) to evaluate the effectiveness of the feed-\nback T provides. Given the ground truth ˜y, the\nreward is 1 if the current response yt = M(st,at)\ncontains the ground truth, which means ˜y ∈yt.\nOtherwise, it is 0.\n3.2 Mistake Gathering and Retrieval\nThe study assistant T maintains a global mistake\nmemory Oerr for both the collection and the exami-\nnation phase. Each entry in Oerr takes the query as\nthe key and a list of incorrect answers and feedback\nas the value. For example, the entry gathered from\nFigure 1 is <‘Jane thought today ... a month age’,\n(‘02/11/2002’, ‘Analysis: ..., Guideline: ...’)>, the\nfirst element is the key and the second is the value.\nFor each state st in the gathering phase, Tretrieves\nprevious mistakes for the current query and updates\nthe entry with the current response yt if it is incor-\nrect R(st,at) = 0. During the examination phase,\nT retrieves relevant mistakes based on the cosine\nsimilarity between the key and the current query\nq. We limit the maximum number of retrieved\nmistakes by a hyperparameter k and a minimum\nsimilarity threshold with θ.\n3.3 General Study Assistant\nThe goal of the study assistant is to learn a policy\nπ(a|s) on S →A that provides feedback based\non the state. It can be a general study assistant\nmodel trained on the mistake datasets, agnostic to\nLLMs. We initialize the policy with a 7B LLaMA\nmodel (other models would work as well) and fine-\ntune it on a small feedback dataset generated by\nGPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). Given a current state s,\nthe policy is:\nπ(a|s) =p(a0,··· ,al|ρ(q,c,y)). (1)\nai is the i-th token in feedback a. ρis a template-\nbased function to map the query q, the context c\nand current response y to a text prompt. Since the\nstudy assistant only depends on ρ(q,c,y) and is\nunaware of where mistakes are from, it is model-\nagnostic and can directly be adapted to unseen tasks\nand new models. An example of prompting the\nstudy assistant T to provide feedback is shown in\nFigure 2. In this example, the study assistant is\nasked to provide feedback for the main LLM who\nis prompted to calculate last month’s date. The\nuncolored text in the prompt is the template used to\nInstructionJane thought today is 3/11/2002, but today is in fact Mar12, which is 1 day later. What is the date a month ago?Options:(A) 04/12/2001(B) 02/11/2002(C) 02/12/2002(D) 02/08/2002(E) 05/22/2002(F) 02/18/2002\nAnalysis: The model might have misunderstood the phrase “1 day later” in the context.Guideline: For dates in a problem, identify the correct date from which calculations should be made. Also, make sure to maintain the correct format (MM/DD/YYYY) while providing the answer.\nStudy Assistant Response\nWe get the answer (B) 02/11/2002 ; 04/12/2001 fromthe model while the correct answer is (C) 02/12/2002 .Please return with the following fields:Analysis: explain the potential reason for predictionGuideline: based on the reason, provide instruction to avoid similar mistakes. Please do not mention the true answer or any specific option content in your response.\nFigure 2: Example for prompting the study assistant at t= 1\nduring collection. The previous wrong answer y0 (is green) is\nretrieved from mistake memory. The query q and the ground\ntruth ˜y are in blue. The orange content is the current wrong\nanswer y1. For examination, there is no the previous answer,\ncurrent answer, and ground truth in the prompt and the study\nassistant is asked to directly provide guidelines.\nprompt the study assistant and the text in blue is the\nquery. The current response y1=‘04/12/2001’ is in\norange. Here the context c1 in green is the previous\nwrong answer of this query y0=‘(B) 02/11/2002’\nretrieved from Oerr. The response of the study\nassistant is generated via the policy in Equation 1.\n3.4 Imitation Learning for Study Assistant\nTo enhance the guidance for a specific LLM, we\ncan further useMto fine-tune T. The performance\nimprovement of Mcan be viewed as the hindsight\nfor the policy of T. Following studies of learning\nfrom hindsight (Uesato et al., 2022; Zhang et al.,\n2023; Liu et al., 2023), we apply imitation learning\nto learn a specific feedback policy for one model\nM. It includes two phases: online sampling and\npolicy fine-tuning.\nSpecifically, given the state st = {q,yt,ct}, we\nsample various possible actions at from the current\npolicy model and obtain a replay dataset: Don =⋃T\nt=0\n⋃N\ni=0{(s(i)\nt ,a(i)\nt )}. Then, we calculate the\nreward R(s(i)\nt ,a(i)\nt ) and get a filtered dataset only\n10670\nTable 1: Examples of queries and answers for BBH and BBQ benchmark. We provide the options in the prompt and the model is\nexpected to generate a response that contains the answer.\nBenchmark Example Query Answer #Task\nBBH\n(Suzgun et al.,\n2022)\nAt the start of the semester, Alice gets Ulysses, Bob gets Frankenstein, and\nClaire gets Lolita.

We further conduct compre-\nhensive analyses from different aspects to enhance\nthe understanding of SALAM.\n4.1 Benchmark\nBig-Bench-Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022) is a\nsubset of challenging tasks from Big-Bench (Srivas-\ntava et al., 2022), targeting evaluating the reasoning\ncapability of large language models under the zero-\nshot or few-shot setting. It contains 23 challenging\ntasks where prior language model evaluations fail\nthe average human rater. We focus on 16 English\nmulti-choice question-answering tasks in BBH.\nBias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) (Parrish et al.,\n2022) is a question set on the potential social bias\nalong 9 social dimensions. It tests the capability\nof LLMs to avoid biases in both informative and\nunder-informative contexts. The original bench-\nmark contains 58k examples that can be used for\nboth training and evaluation. Similar to BBH, we\nrandomly select 250 examples for each task.\nFor each task in the benchmark, we split the\ndata by 0.8/0.2 to build the training and test set.\nThe training set is used for the gathering phase\nand the test set is for the examination phase. We\nreformulated the multi-choice question-answering\nto a generation task. For each query, we added\noptions to the prompt. The generation contained\nthe correct option or the option content was viewed\nas a correct answer. We calculated the accuracy\nrate as the evaluation metric. We demonstrate one\nexample for each benchmark in Table 1 and leave\nother details in Appendix A.1.\n4.2 Experiment Setup\nIn the experiment, we take the 11B Flan-T5-\nXXL (Chung et al., 2022), 20B GPT-NeoX (Black\net al., 2022), 7B LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023)\nas M. We evaluate Flan-T5 under the zero-shot\nsetting while GPT-Neox and LLaMA under the few-\nshot setting. It is because we found GPT-NeoX and\nLLaMA could hardly follow the zero-shot prompt\nto generate structured responses. We use the few-\n10671\nshot examples provided by Suzgun et al. (2022) for\nBBH, and manually generated 3 few-shot examples\nfor each task in BBQ.\nFor the model-agnosticT, we finetune a LLaMA\nmodel with 7 billion on a feedback dataset gen-\nerated by GPT-4 2 according to the mistakes of\nFlan-T5. The feedback dataset includes 1855 feed-\nback for BBH and 514 feedback for BBQ. GPT-4\nis prompted with the format in Figure 2. This T is\ndirectly used to provide feedback for LLaMA and\nGPT-NeoX.\nFor the model-aware SALAM, we sample 20\ntrajectories for each mistake of Mwith a tempera-\nture of 0.8 and followed Section 3.4 to get the ˜Don.\nIt was optimized with Equation 3. The sampling\nof one trajectory is terminated if it gets a reward\nof 1 (correct response). The maximum number of\nactions depends on the number of options in the\nquery. For example, for one query with 4 options,\nthe maximum number of actions is T=4 because\nit should arrive at the right answer after 3 failures.\nWe call it SALAM w/ IL. We finetuned all models\non two A6000 GPUs for 10 epochs with a learning\nrate of 2e-5 for about 7 hours. The parameters are\nupdated every 32 instances.\n4.3 Baseline\nWe set up three baselines: Mdirectly takes the\nquery as the prompt. Mw/ Ocorr keeps a collec-\ntion of correct answers, similar to the mistake mem-\nory described in Section 3.2 except that the entry\nhas a reward of 1. It retrieves relevant queries\nand takes them as enhanced few-shot examples.\nMw/ Oerr retrieves incorrect cases from the col-\nlection, but different from SALAM, there is no\nfeedback from T. It performs as an ablation study\nthat removes the feedback policy of T. We illus-\ntrate several cases in Appendix A.2. For SALAM\nw/ IL and SALAM, we use retrieved mistakes and\nthe guideline as the instruction.\nWe also compare our method with Self-\nRefine (Madaan et al., 2023). We use the same\nMfor generation, feedback, and refinement via\ndifferent prompts and in-context learning examples.\nWe follow the implementation of the official repo3\nand adapt it to the BBH and BBQ benchmarks. For\neach benchmark, we use 3 in-context examples for\neach module. We set the number of iterations to a\nfixed number (k= 2) since the ground truth labels\n2https://chat.openai.com/?model=gpt-4\n3https://github.com/madaan/self-refine\nare not accessible during the examination phase.\nFor retrieval, we use SentenceTrans-\nformer4(Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) to\ncalculate the sentence embedding and the cosine\nsimilarity. SALAM retrieves top k = 1 queries\nfrom the mistake memory and filters candidates\nwith a similarity lower than θ= 0.9.\nNote that during the examination phase, both T\nand Mare unaware of the ground truth, so there is\nno signal from the ground truth. This is a more gen-\neral setting, which is different from the reflection\nof Alfworld (Yao et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023),\nor the feedback of self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023)\nwith external classifiers.\nTable 2: Accuracy (%) over tasks.

(ii) Is SALAM data efficient? (iii) Which\nlearning strategy is better, learning from success\nor learning from failure?\nSALAM achieves superior average perfor-\nmance on both benchmarks. As shown in Ta-\nble 2, SALAM can enhance performance for all\nthree M, with a particularly notable improvement\nfor Flan-T5. Even though SALAM is not trained\n4https://www.sbert.net/\n10672\nto provide feedback for mistakes made by LLaMA\nand GPT-NeoX, it still yields benefits for these\nmodels. This indicates that SALAM can effec-\ntively enhance reasoning ability and reduce bias by\nproviding global feedback based on past mistake\nmemorys. It’s notable that this is a general frame-\nwork that can be effortlessly adapted to a new LLM\nwithout additional training. The performance of\nSelf-refine even falls behind direct prompting (M).\nWe observe that it is challenging for Self-refine’s\nfeedback module to identify the accuracy of the\ncurrent response without knowing the ground truth,\ncausing it to repeatedly revise correct answers (see\nAppendix A.4). Furthermore, it proves difficult\nfor less powerful LLMs to generate textual feed-\nback and perform reasoning tasks with only limited\nin-context examples.\nFailure can sometimes be more valuable\nthan success. Comparing the performance of\nMw/ Ocorr and Mw/ Oerr in Table 2, we find\nthat mistakes can sometimes be more beneficial.\nThis might be because past successful attempts in-\ndicate the model’s capability of correctly dealing\nwith similar queries, providing little aid for what\nthe model has not yet mastered. Such attempts\nmight even lead the model to perform worse than\nin the zero-shot setting, showcasing the impact of\nnegative feedback. This observation emphasizes\nthe importance of choosing suitable few-shot exam-\nples. On the other hand, examples of mistakes help\nrectify past incorrect answers, providing superior\nguidance for questions the model struggles with.\nTable 3: Task Accuracy (%) of Flan-T5 on BBH benchmark.\n* indicates the accuracy improvement is more than 10% com-\npared with M.

When comparing SALAM w/\nIL and SALAM, it’s observed that model-specific\nfeedback can further improve M’s performance by\nadapting its behavior based on successful experi-\nences. However, the improvement is rather mod-\nest when taking into account the computational\nresources it requires. While a single checkpoint of\nSALAM was finetuned for all three LLMs, it was\nnecessary to finetune three separate checkpoints for\nSALAM w/ IL, each corresponding to a different\nLLM. Several cases are illustrated in Table 14 in\nAppendix A.7 for further reference.\nSALAM manifests data efficiency. We investi-\ngate the data efficiency of SALAM in Table 3. In\nthis scenario, we only provide feedback on 10%\nof the training data, whereas other baselines have\naccess to all training data. The complete results\nare presented in Table 10. Despite the limited data,\nSALAM still exceeds the performances of other\nbaselines and shows over 10% improvements on\n6 out of 16 tasks. This suggests that SALAM can\neffectively summarize a limited number of mis-\ntakes and provide targeted feedback. However,\nSALAM struggles considerably with the tracking\nshuffled objective tasks, evidenced by a significant\nperformance decline. We hypothesize that the dif-\nficulty of these tasks demands a larger dataset to\ncover a wide variety of mistakes. A similar trend is\nalso observed in geometric shapes, where the zero-\nshot performance is low, and the improvement is\nmarginal. However, with more feedback data, these\ntasks can be further improved as shown in Table 10.\n4.5 Analysis\nIn this section, we dive into several aspects to en-\nhance the understanding of SALAM.\nHow do feedback strategies impact perfor-\nmance? We investigate the impact of various feed-\nback strategies in Table 4. Here, we set k= 3and\nθ= 0.9 to include more feedback. The study assis-\ntant provides feedback on two dimensions: ananal-\nysis of the potential reason for the mistake, and the\nguideline to avoid similar mistakes. It also retrieves\nprevious similar mistakes as context. We test dif-\nferent instruction combinations for the model M.\nAdditionally, we allow the study assistant to di-\nrectly generate guidelines for the new query with-\nout any retrieval ( direct guideline). The results\nindicate that in most cases, the pairing of mistakes\nand guidelines yields the best performance. We at-\ntribute this to the fact that the analyses are typically\n10673\nlengthy and take up the majority of the instructions,\nmisleading Mto generate a similar analysis instead\nof generating an answer based on the given options.\nDirect guidelines without retrieval often degrade\nperformance, which emphasizes the importance of\nmistake memory.\nTable 4: Various feedback strategies for SALAM. The re-\ntrieved mistakes and guidelines both boost the performance.\nHowever, the analysis is too long and misleads the generation\nto the incorrect format.\nBBH BBQ\nFlan T5 11B\nRetrieval Guideline 47.1 82.2\nMistake + Guideline 47.1 85.3\nMistake + Analysis + Guideline 45.5 80.0\nDirect Guideline 46.4 76.4\nLLaMA 7B\nRetrieval Guideline 27.6 31.1\nMistake + Guideline 28.3 32.5\nMistake + Analysis + Guideline 26.9 32.4\nDirect Guideline 20.0 24.4\nGPT-Neox 20B\nRetrieval Guideline 24.3 33.1\nMistake + Guideline 25.7 26.5\nMistake + Analysis + Guideline 27.7 28.6\nDirect Guideline 25.4 33.5\nHow does retrieval impact performance? Re-\ntrieval plays a critical role in our SALAM frame-\nwork. There are two essential hyperparameters:\ntopk restricts the number of retrieved entries by\nonly returning the kentries with the highest scores,\nwhereas θsets the minimum similarity score that\nthe retrieved examples should achieve.\nIn Figure 3a, we set a low θ = 0to accept all\nretrieved entries. It is observed that as kincreases,\nthe accuracy continues to decline. This is likely\nbecause more irrelevant examples are retrieved,\nleading to the misleading of the model. The trend\nof SALAM is more pronounced, with the perfor-\nmance dropping to zero when k increases to 10.\nUpon examining the generations, we find that with\nmore guidelines in the prompt, the model treats\nthese guidelines as few-shot examples rather than\ninstructions, leading it to generate similar guide-\nlines rather than an answer to the query.\nIn Figure 3b, we set a large k = 10to retrieve\nentries with varying similarity scores. The results\nshow that with the increase of the threshold, the\naccuracy also increases. For Mw/ Ocorr, the rele-\nvance of the few-shot examples proves to be partic-\nularly important, which aligns with previous stud-\nTop1 Top3 Top5 Top10\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\nRetrieval Number\nAccuracy\nOcorr\nOerr\nSALAM\n(a) Topk. θis set to 0.\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n20\n40\n60\n80\nRetrieval Threshold\nAccuracy\nOcorr\nOerr\nSALAM (b) θ.

The y-axis indicates\nthe average accuracy over various tasks.\nies on few-shot learning. Interestingly, SALAM\nlags behind Mw/ Oerr at low thresholds, but sur-\npasses it at high thresholds and ultimately achieves\nthe best performance. This suggests that the rele-\nvance of retrieved examples is more important than\ntheir quantity.\nAre pseudo mistakes helpful? In Section 3.2,\nwe gather mistakes from previous attempts on the\ntraining set, which we refer to as real mistakes.\nHowever, this process requires Mto make an ex-\ntra pass over the training set. Alternatively, we\ncan generate pseudo mistakes by arbitrarily select-\ning an incorrect answer option of the query as the\npseudo mistake. Therefore, we assess the perfor-\nmance of Mwhen given a single pseudo mistake.\nSpecifically, we utilize the entirety of the dataset\nas the evaluation set, since we do not need to tra-\nverse the training set to collect mistakes. For the\nzero-shot setting, we prompt Mwith the query\nand identify the pseudo mistake, while for the few-\nshot setting, we provide three examples with both\nthe pseudo mistake and the correct answer. The\ndetailed prompts can be found in Table 12. The\nresults are exhibited in Figure 4. In most cases,\npseudo mistakes appear to have a detrimental ef-\n10674\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\nRace_x_SES\nRace_x_gender\nReligion\nSES\nSexual_orientatio\nOverall\nZero-shot SALAM\nFigure 5: Results on out-of-domain tasks. We collect mistakes\nfrom the first 6 tasks and evaluate the feedback on the other\ntasks on BBQ.\nfect on performance. Even though we provide\nfew-shot examples that demonstrate how to cor-\nrect the mistake, the performance on BBQ still\ndeteriorates. This suggests that pseudo mistakes\ntypically fail to expose the model’s actual short-\ncomings. Instead, these pseudo mistakes may con-\nfuse the model. Therefore, learning from the real\nmistakes of the model is necessary.\nCan feedback generalize to unseen tasks?\nTo investigate the generalization capability of\nSALAM, we divide the BBQ benchmark into two\nsections. The first five tasks are taken as the in-\ndomain tasks and mistakes are collected from them,\nwhile the remaining tasks are considered out-of-\ndomain. We set the retrieval topk at 1, to use only\nthe most relevant mistake. We evaluate the perfor-\nmance of the out-of-domain tasks. As evidenced\nin Figure 5, SALAM is also beneficial for unseen\ntasks if these tasks share some similarities with the\nexisting errors.\nHow does it perform when using GPT-4 as\nthe main LLM or the study assistant? We also\nexamine SALAM’s capability on larger LLMs like\nGPT-4. Due to cost concerns, we only perform the\ncomparison on a random subset (10%) of the origi-\nnal set. We first use GPT-4 as the main LLM and\nemploy our finetuned study assistant for feedback.\nThe results are displayed in Table 5. It reveals that\neven though GPT-4 already exhibits strong perfor-\nmance on the BBQ benchmark, leaving minimal\nroom for SALAM to enhance, SALAM signifi-\ncantly boosts GPT-4’s performance on BBH. This\nsuggests that even a large model like GPT-4 can\nbenefit from feedback provided by our study assis-\ntant.\nAdditionally, we use GPT-4 to provide feedback\non 10% of the training set for M= LLaMA and\npresent the results in Table 6. For a fair comparison,\nwe also provide SALAM with 10% feedback as one\nbaseline. From the table, it’s observed that with\nthe provided 10% feedback, GPT-4 outperforms\nSALAM by 2.1 on BBH and 0.7 on BBQ. However,\nSALAM with 100% feedback surpasses GPT-4,\nunderscoring the importance of diverse feedback.\nGiven our SALAM is much more cost-effective\nthan GPT-4, it demonstrates the potential of our\nSALAM to provide effective feedback.\nTable 5: SALAM with M = GPT-4 on random 10% of test\nset.

This framework\nis inspired by the methods human study assistants\nuse to support students, by identifying common\nerrors and providing guidance. The student model\nsends its generations to the study assistant and re-\nfines these based on the feedback received. The\nstudy assistant identifies errors, offers feedback,\nand gauges its success by the student model’s per-\nformance improvement. We validated the effective-\nness of SALAM on the BBH and BBQ benchmarks,\nshowing significant improvement in the model’s\nperformance. Furthermore, we use the LLMs’ per-\nformance as the signal to further finetune the study\nassistant for model-specific guidance. We believe\nthat our method offers a novel way to augment\nLLMs by the cooperation between multiple agents.\n10675\nLimitations\nHere we would like to discuss several limitations\nof this work. In the current SALAM, the study\nassistant infers the cause of an error by comparing\nthe answer with the ground truth. However, for\ncomplex reasoning tasks, the answer itself is not\nenough because there are many intermediate steps\nthat will lead to the error. We did not take the full\nreasoning process because the limitation of the con-\ntext length of LLMs and the LLaMA used for the\nstudy assistant. Additionally, the study assistant’s\nperformance is limited by the capabilities of the 7B\nLLaMA. We did not use a larger model because of\nthe limited computation resources for finetuning.\nWe believe that integrating thinking steps and en-\nhancing the model capability of the study assistant\ncould facilitate SALAM.\nFurthermore, the ultimate performance of LLMs\nin SALAM is restricted by their own capabilities,\nas they cannot access external knowledge. The\nLLMs are prompted to refine their responses based\nsolely on feedback from prior errors. For factual\ntasks, if an LLM has not learned certain facts dur-\ning training, it becomes unfeasible to generate the\ncorrect answer. Nonetheless, the study assistant\ncan guide the LLM toward an optimized answer by\nclarifying query misunderstandings and avoiding\ncommon mistakes via mistake memorys. We pro-\npose that the incorporation of external knowledge\nwill enhance SALAM, a consideration we reserve\nfor future research.\nEthic Statement\nIn our study, we used existing datasets and con-\nducted our experiments on open-source bench-\nmarks BBH and BBQ under their respective li-\ncenses. The computational resources needed are\ndiscussed in Section 4.2. In SALAM, we did not\nfine-tune the main LLM, which can be costly. In-\nstead, we fine-tuned a more cost-effective study\nassistant. BBQ is an English benchmark designed\nto identify the potential bias of LLMs in both infor-\nmative and under-informative contexts. However,\nit is confined to a specific cultural context and cov-\ners only nine dimensions of social biases. A higher\nBBQ score doesn’t signify the LLM is universally\nless biased. For detailed ethical considerations of\nthis benchmark, we direct readers to the original\npaper (Suzgun et al., 2022).\nReferences\nYuntao Bai, Andy Jones, Kamal Ndousse, Amanda\nAskell, Anna Chen, Nova DasSarma, Dawn Drain,\nStanislav Fort, Deep Ganguli, Tom Henighan, et al.\n2022a.

The blue ones are the re-\ntrieved examples based on k= 3and θ= 0.9. For\nSALAM, we use the mistake and the guideline as\nthe instruction.\nA.3 Training Details\nGiven one query, the model Mgenerates one po-\ntential answer and refines its answer according to\nthe feedback from the study assistant. Therefore,\nthey should be large language models that have the\nability to follow instructions or conduct in-context\nlearning from few-shot examples. On the other\n10678\nFigure 6: Training Loss on BBH.\nFigure 7: Training Loss on BBQ.\nside, we finetune a pre-trained language model\non a small collected feedback dataset as the gen-\neral study assistant. It provides feedback given the\ntextual prompt regardless of model M. We then\nfinetune a model-aware study assistant based on\nSection 3.4 to provide more targeted guidance.\nIn Figure 6 and Figure 7 we plot the training loss\nof SALAM. The loss converged after 150 steps on\nboth datasets.\nA.4 Detailed Analysis for Self-Refine\nWe investigate the influence of iteration numbers\nin Table 8. The performance decreases instead\nof increasing after two iterations. We find that\nit is because Self-refine’s feedback module can\nhardly identify the correctness of the current re-\nsponse without knowing the ground truth and it\nkeeps refining the correct answer. It is consistent\nwith the observation of Huang et al. (2023) where\nthe LLMs’ performance drops after self-correction\nwithout the use of labels to determine when to stop.\nMoreover, it is difficult for less powerful LLMs to\nreason and create textual feedback only with lim-\nited in-context examples. For example, here is one\ncase from Flan-t5 + Self-refine on BBH which just\ncopied the query. The feedback module provides\nlittle guidance on the revision.\nQuery: The designer called the janitor and\nasked him to clean the room.\nOptions:\n(A) Asked the designer\n(B) Asked the janitor\n(C) Ambiguous\nThe answer is The designer\nWhy is this answer wrong?\nFeedback: The designer asked him to clean\nthe room.\nA.5 Supervised Finetuning Baseline\nWe provide the supervised baseline for LLaMA\n(7b) finetuned on the same training set in Table 9.\nFlan-t5 (11b) and GPT-NeoX (20b) caused OOM\neven with batch size=1 on the A6000 GPU, which\nmakes it impossible for us to fully fine-tune these\nmodels. It also demonstrates the advantage of\nSALAM which is more computationally efficient.\nWe used the same hyperparameters as the study\nassistant, and the model converged after 150 steps\non both benchmarks. As the results show, the su-\npervised models outperformed other models by a\nlarge margin on BBQ, indicating that the social\nbias can be effectively reduced with the finetuning\ndata. However, for the reasoning benchmark BBH,\nthe supervised model does not have more advan-\ntages. We suppose it is because complex reasoning\nis more difficult to learn with limited data. How-\never, with the assistance of our SALAM, it is easier\nto figure out the common misunderstanding and\ncan better generalize.\nTable 8: Self Refine with different iterations. Without knowing\nwhen to stop, the model keeps refining on correct answers,\nmaking the performance worse.\nM iter = 0 iter = 1 iter = 2\nBBH\nFlan-t5 42.4 16.1 17.4\nLLaMA 26.1 11.6 9.80\nGPT-NeoX 24.9 22.6 23.0\nBBQ\nFlan-t5 76.6 27.6 28.0\nLLaMA 24.7 23.1 12.4\nGPT-NeoX 26.0 34.4 32.4\nTable 9: Supervised Finetuning Baseline for M = LLaMA.\nBBH BBQ\nM 26.1 24.7\nM w/ SFT 29.3 74\nSALAM w/ replay 30.4 37.3\n10679\nA.6 Full Results on BBH\nWe list the full results on BBH in Table 10. The\nhyper-parameters are the same for 10% and 100%,\nsuch as k=3 and theta=0.9. In Table 3, we find\nthat SALAM struggles with complex tasks such\nas tracking shuffled objects and geometric shapes.\nHere we can find with more data, the performance\nof SALAM on these tasks improved significantly.\nHowever, the performance on some simple tasks\ndegrades. We checked the results and found that it\nretrieved less relevant examples. Under the same\nretrieval setting, the larger training set may add\nsome noise to the retrieved context, leading to the\nsame observation as the retrieval analysis in Section\n4.5.\nA.7 Case Study\nIn Table 13 we illustrate several explanations gen-\nerated by SALAM. For brevity, we ignore the re-\ntrieved mistakes and only provide the key fields\nwithout the full template. The full prompts are\nin Table 11. We can find that the analysis pro-\nvides a reasonable explanation for the mistake and\nthe guideline mentions error-prone points based\non it. However, some guidelines are too general\nand cannot provide much useful information for\nrefinement.\nTable 14 illustrates guidelines provided by\nSALAM and SALAM w/ replay for the same query.\nWe can see that the guideline provided by SALAM\ntends to be more genetic, while the guideline pro-\nvided by SALAM w/ replay focuses more on the\nspecific context and is more informative.\n10680\nTable 10: Full task Accuracy (%) of Flan-T5 on BBH benchmark.\nM w/ Ocorr w/ Oerr 10% SALAM 100% SALAM\ndate understanding 48.0 48.0 46.0 46.0 50.0\ndisambiguation qa 64.0 68.0 70.0 80.0 78.0\ngeometric shapes 14.0 12.0 6.0 14.0 28.0\nhyperbaton 62.0 84.0 84.0 84.0 88.0\nlogical deduction three 72.0 78.0 58.0 72.0 62.0\nlogical deduction five 50.0 20.0 40.0 70.0 56.0\nlogical deduction seven 64.0 4.0 6.0 62.0 56.0\nmovie recommendation 30.0 54.0 44.0 42.0 72.0\npenguins in a table 46.7 16.7 16.7 43.3 36.7\nreasoning about colored objects 62.0 60.0 62.0 64.0 64.0\nruin names 16.0 22.0 28.0 26.0 40.0\nsnarks 61.1 77.8 75.0 75.0 58.3\ntemporal sequences 26.0 28.0 24.0 26.0 24.0\ntracking shuffled objects three 34.0 28.0 28.0 24.0 28.0\ntracking shuffled objects five 18.0 14.0 18.0 10.0 14.0\ntracking shuffled objects seven 10.0 0.0 0.0 16.0 22.0\nAverage 42.4 38.4 37.9 47.1 48.6\n10681\nTable 11: Prompts used for different baselines.

While ’he’\ncould technically refer to either the engineer or the client,\nthe context strongly implies that ’he’ refers to the client,\nwhich the model seems to have overlooked.\nGuideline: When identifying the antecedent of a pro-\nnoun, it’s essential to consider the surrounding context\nand the semantic roles of the entities involved. In sen-\ntences where the pronoun is embedded in a clause pro-\nviding information or instructions, it often refers to the\nentity that the information or instruction is about.\nQuery 2:\nWhich sentence has the correct adjective order:\nOptions:\n(A) American triangular computer\n(B) triangular American computer\nCorrect answer: (B) triangular American computer.\nPrevious answer: (A) American triangular computer\nAnalysis: The model might have made an error in iden-\ntifying the correct order of adjectives according to the\ngeneral rules of adjective order in English.\nGuideline: When evaluating sentences with multiple\nadjectives, consider the general rules of adjective order in\nEnglish, such as opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin,\nmaterial, and purpose, to determine the correct order\nand select the most appropriate option among the given\nchoices.\nQuery 3:\nWhich of the following is a humorous edit of this artist\nor movie name: ’night club’?\nOptions:\n(A) light club\n(B) nigut club\n(C) night cslub\n(D) nigdht club\nCorrect answer: (D) nigdht club\nPrevious answer: (A)\nAnalysis: The model may have predicted the incorrect\nanswer because it did not recognize the humor or word-\nplay in the options. It might have chosen an option that\nseemed like a minor alteration of the original name, with-\nout understanding the humorous potential of the other\nchoices.\nGuideline: To avoid similar mistakes, focus on identify-\ning wordplay or humor in the options provided. Consider\nthe context and how altering the original name can create\na humorous or clever twist. Choose the option that best\ndemonstrates this type of humor or wordplay, even if\nit involves more significant alterations to the original\nname.\nQuery 4:\nWhich statement is sarcastic?\nOptions:\n(A) What a poor guy, years of work and he only got a\n$50,000 scholarship\n(B) What a poor guy, years of work and he only got a\n$50 scholarship\nCorrect answer: (A)\nPrevious answer: (B)\nAnalysis: The model may have predicted the incorrect\nanswer because it did not accurately recognize the sar-\ncasm in the options. It might have chosen an option that\nseemed close in phrasing to the correct answer, without\nunderstanding the nuances of sarcasm.\nGuideline: To avoid similar mistakes, focus on identify-\ning the sarcasm in the options provided.

Choose the option that best demonstrates sarcasm,\neven if the differences between the options are subtle.\nQuery 5:\nA 78-year-old man was talking to his 24-year-old friend\nabout how much politics has changed in just the last few\ndecades. Who embraces change?\nOptions:\n(A) The 24-year-old\n(B) Cannot answer\n(C) The 78-year-old\nCorrect answer: (B) Cannot answer\nPrevious answer: (A)\nAnalysis: The model may have chosen (A) because it\nassumed that younger people are generally more likely\nto embrace change, especially in the context of politics.\nHowever, the text does not provide enough information\nto determine which individual actually embraces change.\nGuideline: In the future, carefully analyze the text for\nexplicit information before making a decision. If there is\ninsufficient information to make a determination, choose\nthe option which doesn’t make a decision rather than\nmaking assumptions based on stereotypes or generaliza-\ntions.\n10684\nTable 14: Guidelines provided by SALAM and SALAM w/ replay.
