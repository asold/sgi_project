In this article, the features of the oscillatory circuit are investigated in order to determine \nthe possibility of th eir application for controlling thrusters when building new, simple and reliable \ncircuits for regulating booster voltage stabilizers from the value of the supply voltage. In Ferro \nresonant circuits connected to a voltage source with low internal resistance , with a certain \ncombination of parameters, oscillations are excited at the fundamental frequency, the initial phase of \nwhich has a shift relative to the initial phase of the applied voltage. \n1 Introduction  \nElectricity, as a special type of product, has certain \ncharacteristics that make it possible to judge its \nsuitability in various production processes. \nThe set of characteristics under which power \nreceivers are able to perform their functions are united \nby the general concept of power quality. The quali ty of \nelectricity is assessed by the damage caused to the \nnational economy [1-5, 8, 10]. \nThe quality of electricity, along with reliability and \nsafety, is one of the mandatory requirements for power \nsupply systems. The quality of electricity is \ncharacterized by a combination of properties and \nindicators of energy quality. \nEnsuring the required quality of electrical energy is a \nproblem that is present at all stages of the existence of \nelectrical energy, including generation, transmission, \ndistribution and co nsumption. The main parameter and \nindicator of the quality of electrical energy is considered \nto be voltage and its quality. \n2 The current state of the investigated \nproblem \nOne of the reasons for the deterioration of the quality of \nelectricity is the so -called \"dips\" of voltage, which are \nobserved during the switching of powerful steel-smelting \nelectric furnaces, semiconductor converters, etc. Voltage \ndips can be both short -term and long-term, one-time and \nreusable per shift in enterprises with a continuous nature \nof production. Voltage dips lead not only to a \ndeterioration in the operation of power receivers in these \nenterprises, but also to a complete stop of the entire \ntechnological process. For example, in the spinning \nshops of textile mills, when the sp inning machine stops, \nit takes up to three hours to fully restore their work, \nwhich leads to great economic damage [6-12, 14, 15]. \nDevices that could compensate for voltage dips in the \nsupply network must meet the following requirements: \ngreater sensitivity to changes in the voltage value at the \ninput of this device and the speed of regulation of the \nvoltage value of the power source [13, 14, 20-26]. \n \nThere are a large number of works devoted to voltage \nregulation using a booster  transformer (VDT), the \ncontrol system of which is made on the basis of \nsemiconductor elements [8, 15, 17-19, 27-30]. \nIt should be noted that these systems have a relatively \ncomplex semiconductor circuit base, and in regions \nwhere the average ambient tempe rature in summer can \nreach 50\n0 C and above, small -sized semiconductor \ndevices begin to work with a large error or completely \nfail. \nDespite the recent rapid growth of semiconductor \ntechnology, the variety of physical properties and \nnumerous possibilities of  electroferromagnetic circuits \nstill attract the attention of researchers to them. \nThis article discusses the issue of creating simple and \nreliable control systems for VDTs based on a parallel \noscillatory circuit connected in series with a linear \ninductance (Fig. 1) [28, 9, 15].  \n \nFig. 1.

Hysteresis losses, eddy  currents and active \nresistance of the winding of a non -linear PV are \nconsidered constant and are taken into account by the \nconductivity g connected in parallel to the PV. \n2. We neglect losses in capacitance C and leakage \ninductance of PV windings. \n3. Only the fundamental harmonic of the \nharmonically changing magnitude of the magnetic flux is \ntaken into account. \n4. PV magnetic flux curve belongs to the category of \nsymmetrical characteristics, so it must be approximated \nby a power function of an odd degree. \nIn addition, we neglect the losses in the core of the \nlinear inductor, in view of their smallness. \nThe study is carried out by the method of slowly \nchanging amplitudes. The circuit under study is \ndescribed by the following differential equation: \n \n(1) \nWhere \n  \nФЭg C i i i i+ +=  (2) \n \nHere, the amplitude value of the first harmonic of the \nmagnetic flux, determined from the condition of equality \nof the amplitude values of the currents in the winding of \nthe PV and the capacitor, is taken as the basic valu e of \nthe magnetic flux C connected in parallel, which \ncorresponds to the point of intersection PV and capacitor \nC. \n[ ] 226 - - 1 (γβ mm XУ =  ( 3 ) \nγ\nβψ 1 - ) X - (1-tg\n6\nm=\n \n( 4 ) \nTo build the CVC of the circuit and determine its \namplitude-phase characteristics , it is necessary to \ndetermine the dependencies I=f(Ф) and ϕ=f(U) \n2\n2 6- ) - 1 (\n\n\n\n\n= β\nγ\nmm m X X Z  ( 5 ) \nψβ\nγ\nβ\nγψ\nϕ\ntgX\ntg\nm - ) 1 - (\n- ) 1 - (X\n-tg\n6\n6\nm\n=\n \n( 6 ) \nThe results obtained by formula (6) have both positive \nand negative values: \n- the negative value of the angle φ corresponds to the \nphase advance of the load current, from the mains \nvoltage; \n- the positive value of the angle φ corresponds to the \nlag of the phase of the load current from the voltage of \nthe power source. \nFig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the dependences φ=f(Ym ) \nand Ym= f(Zm) characteristics of the circuit under \nconsideration, constructed using equations 1, 2, 3 and 4. \nAs can be seen from these Fig. 3, the dependence Y\nm \n= f(Zm) has a falling section (ab) where the magnitude of \nthe current varies inversely with the magnitude of the \napplied voltage, the width and slope of which can be \nchanged by changing the circuit parameters.

VDT circuit with a smooth control system as a function of voltage \n \ncurrent phase shift in the unbranched section of the  \ncircuit under consideration varies inversely with the \nmagnitude of the applied voltage. \nSo, based on the above, this circuit can be used in the \nVDT control system for smooth voltage regulation at the \nload as a function of the power supply voltage [3, 18, 23, \n25, 27] (see Fig. 4). \nThis device consists of two parts: I - power part i.e. \nbooster transformer and II - VDT control system, which \nconsists of a step-down transformer, a parallel oscillatory \ncircuit connected in series with a linear inductance, a \ntrans reactor with two secondary windings included in an \nunbranched section of a parallel oscillatory circuit. \nThis device consists of two parts: I - power part i.e. \nbooster transformer and II - VDT control system, which \nconsists of a step-down transformer, a parallel oscillatory \ncircuit connected in series with a linear inductance, a \ntrans reactor with two secondary windings included in an \nunbranched section of a parallel oscillatory circuit. The \nsecondary windings of the trans reactor are connected \nthrough diodes and resistances to the control electrodes \nof the thyristors located in the arms of the bridge circuit. \nIt should be noted that the power of the VDT control \nsystem is not more than 10 W. \n 3  Conclusion\n1. The amplitude value of the load current in relative \nunits and the phase angle between the load current and \nthe mains voltage are revealed. \n2. The analysis of the phase relations of the resonant \ncircuit, connected in series with the inductance, showed \nthat the initial phase of the current on the unb ranched \npart of the circuit changes inversely with the applied \nvoltage and has a wide range of dependence on the \nchange in the input voltage. \n3. Possibilities are established for obtaining \namplitude -phase relationships of a given type when \nusing a circuit for smooth control of the thyristor states \nas a function of the mains voltage and creating a \ncontinuously adjustable booster transformer based on \nthem. \nReferences \n1.
