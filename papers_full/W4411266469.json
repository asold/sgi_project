The seminal definition of open access, \nand one upon which most literature still draws, is that of the “Budapest Open Access Initiative” \n(BOAI):\nBy “open access” to this literature, we mean its free availability on the public internet, per-\nmitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of \nthese articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any \nother lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those insepa-\nrable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and dis-\ntribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control \nover the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited [2].\n To achieve this free access to scholarly literature, the BOAI recommends two complementa-\nry strategies. The first is self-archival of scholars’ work in dedicated online archives. The second \ncalls for the establishment of open access journals that ensure immediate open access to the ar-\nticles they publish without any access restriction or subscription fees to readers.\n There are many other definitions of open access, and Bailey [3] gives a useful overview of \nothers and of the evolution of terminology in this space. However, the BOAI still contains the \nfundamental principles and goes hand-in hand with Creative Commons which provides the \nmost prevalent licensing architecture that enables open access.\n The evolution of open access first centered around gold and green options. Green open ac-\ncess, or “the green way to open access, ” is modeled on the practices of physicists who, from as \nfar back as 1991, began archiving personal versions of their papers prior to publication on a \ncentral archive called ArXiv [4]. Gold open access, by contrast, refers to articles that are made \navailable immediately at the point of publication by the publishing journal itself and as the \nmanuscript’s final version of record. Such articles are “born free” [5]. How gold access comes \nabout can vary. Authors may pay an article processing charge (APC), and this may be to a \njournal that is completely open access. The rise of open access mega-journals exemplifies an \ninnovative form of a journal that successfully pursued this model [6]. Journals have also taken \nbrought to you by COREView metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk\nprovided by DCU Online Research Access Service\nEamon Costello \nhttp://www.escienceediting.org70  |  Sci Ed 2019;6(1):69-72\na “hybrid” approach, continuing to publish closed-access arti-\ncles available only via subscription but alongside fully (gold) \nopen access articles for which authors have paid an APC. Ad-\nditionally, some open access journals do not charge any APCs. \n“Diamond open access” is one term posited to define this \nform of non-APC open access:\nIn the Diamond Open Access Model, not-for-profit, non-\ncommercial organizations, associations or networks pub-\nlish material that is made available online in digital format, \nis free of charge for readers and authors and does not allow \ncommercial and for-profit reuse [7].\n “Platinum” offers an alternative term to “diamond” for a \njournal that charges no APCs to authors. Regarding consis-\ntency of terminology, it has the advantage that platinum, like \ngold, is a metal and that it is more valuable than gold. Both \ndiamond and platinum are now used and mean broadly the \nsame thing. However, it will be a new term—bronze open ac-\ncess—that the remainder of this paper focuses on. \nBronze, Free or Fourrée? \nFollowing a study of over 300,000 articles, Piwowar et al. [8] \nposited the term “bronze”:\nWe also add a novel subcategory, Bronze. Bronze shares at-\ntributes of Gold and Hybrid; like both, Bronze OA articles \nare publisher-hosted. Unlike Gold OA, Bronze articles are \nnot published in journals considered open access in the \nDOAJ. Unlike Hybrid, Bronze articles carry no license in-\nformation. Although this lack of identifiable license may \nnot be intentional, without an identifiable license, the arti-\ncles are free to read but do not allow extended reuse rights \nbeyond reading. \n Notably, the term “bronze access” also appears in a tweet \nfrom Ridgway as far back as 2014 [9].\n A central finding of the Piwowar study was their suggestion \nof strong evidence for the existence of an Open Access Cita-\ntion Advantage. Open Access Citation Advantage postulates \nthat open access articles get cited more than their closed \ncounterparts. It is difficult to prove this decisively in the ab-\nsence of randomized controlled trials, as authors could con-\nceivably only choose to publish their best work open access, \nparticularly if high author fees are involved, but increasing ev-\nidence points in this direction [10]. Moreover, all other things \nbeing equal, it is hard to see how articles that have limited ac-\ncess can be read and cited as widely as those with no access \nrestrictions. \n \nSo-called bronze articles also enjoy the benefit of greater ci-\ntation. Piower et al. [8] found that half of bronze articles ap-\npear in “hidden Gold” journals: i.e., journals that look and act \nlike open access journals in many ways but fail to reflect this in \ntheir licensing. In many parts of the world, the intellectual \nproperty legal architecture that is Creative Commons has yet \nto take hold. Creative Commons provides a comprehensible \nand accessible way to add open licensing to written works. It \nnow operates as the de facto legal lingua franca of free access. \nInterestingly, research on the growth of medical journal pub\n-\nlishing in Korea found a correlation between the adoption of \nCreative Commons by journals and their use of technical stan\n-\ndards, such as DOIs, Crossmark, Funder Registry, ORCID ID, \nand XML languages that aid article discoverability and de\n-\nscription by research indexing services such as journal article \ntag suite (JATS) XML [11]. Hence, it can be useful to think of \nopen access as a socio-technical concept. It has roots in a phil\n-\nosophical movement to widen access to the heritage of human \nknowledge but is intertwined with the development of a set of \ntechnologies and standards that allow data to be described and \nshared by computers. Moreover, this could suggest a possible \nconfounding factor to the open access citation advantage that \nhas not been hitherto considered by researchers; i.e., that tech\n-\nnologies generally found alongside Creative Commons may \naid article indexation and discoverability. However, this is not \nto imply that some parts of the world are necessarily playing \ncatch-up to others regarding open access. Many journals in the \nglobal north remain fully closed or even offline. Meanwhile, \ninitiatives such as the SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library \nOn-line) project in Brazil have made massive advances in \nopen access publishing in Latin America and the Caribbean \nbefore spreading to Portugal, Spain, and South Africa [12].\n However, another of Piwowar et al. [8]’s significant findings \nwas a high prevalence of bronze articles in many traditional \nclosed and hybrid journals. This would appear to be an in-\ncreasing trend with major publishers, but not a lot is known \nabout this phenomenon. A casual perusal of the prominent \nhybrid journals from the biggest commercial publishers can \nreveal that several articles are marked as “free. ” Y et this “free” \nlabel may mean that it is free to read only on the journal web-\nsite. The publisher can, in theory, revoke this access at any \ntime. Harnad [13] has derided this practice as “peek-a-boo \nopen access. ” The value of this free access is clear to the pub-\nlisher: It can make some articles free, such as those that it \nthinks will drive readers, attention, and citations to its journal. \nThis increases the reputation of the journal, but because it \ndoes not make all of its articles free all of the time, it can still \ncharge subscription fees to institutions and readers.\n These “free” or Bronze open access articles grant no reuse \nrights. It may not even be clear that the articles can be legally \ndownloaded from the journal website and retained. There are \ncertainly no rights to share or redistribute them. Combined \nBronze, free, or fourrée: an open access commentary\nhttp://www.escienceediting.org Sci Ed 2019;6(1):69-72  |  71\nwith the fact that the “free” access may cease at any time on \nthe publisher’s whim, it is clear that there are limited uses to \nthese articles. For instance, they cannot be used as open edu-\ncational resources with students in a teaching scenario. A \n“free” article cannot be shared with students, such as a PDF in \na learning environment, as there is no license to allow this. It \ncannot be reliably linked to either, as the publisher could re-\nvoke access at any time, leaving a broken link. Indeed, the \nwords “free, ” “bronze, ” and even “open access” seem less rele-\nvant the more one examines the issue.\n \nThe terms gratis and libre [14] sprang from the free and \nopen source software movements to distinguish between two \ntypes of access: Libre, where rights are only granted to read ar\n-\nticles, and Gratis, which gives rights to use and reuse literature. \nHilton et al. [15] and Wiley [16] have expanded these terms to \ndetail the five Rs of Open, which grant rights to reuse, revise, \nredistribute, remix, and retain a given work. This last addition, \nthe right to retain a work, brought the original four Rs to five \nand is interesting because the inability to retain a copy of a \n“free” article is problematic, as we have discussed.\n It is worth going back, however, to an earlier example from \nthe debate over the difference between “free” and “open. ” The \nFree Software Foundation gave simple but evocative meta-\nphors to distinguish between “free” and “open. ” They con-\ntrasted “free beer” with freedom of speech.\n“Free software” means software that respects users’ free-\ndom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have \nthe freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and im-\nprove the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of lib-\nerty, not price. To understand the concept, you should \nthink of “free” as in “free speech, ” not as in “free beer” . We \nsometimes call it “libre software, ” borrowing the French or \nSpanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not \nmean the software is gratis [17].\n There is another useful phrase we can draw on here, which \nis of uncertain provenance, but dates back at least to the 1970s \n[18], when it was used regarding television advertising: “If \nyou are not paying for it, you are the product. ” What might \nthis mean in relation to “free” articles? Publishers may gain \nmany advantages of extra traffic to their website that results \nfrom “free” articles. Because articles cannot be redistributed, it \nperhaps the only way one can share them legally is via links. \nHyperlinks to articles can increase the search engine optimi-\nzation of a journal website, given that a key component of the \nGoogle search engine algorithm is that pages with more in-\ncoming links appear more prominently in search results. In-\ncreasingly, journals now feature “most viewed” or “most ac-\ncessed” tabs on their homepages. Views clearly matter, and \npublishers seek ways to maximize them.\n An interesting feature of such articles in hybrid journals is \nthat they often include an icon of an opened lock. This ap-\npears to directly mimic the open access symbol created by \nPLOS One (Fig. 1). If so, it could be classified as an example \nof “openwashing” [19]. “Openwashing” refers to an arguably \ndeceptive practice, insofar as it purports to be open but does \nso only to make itself more attractive. In reality, it does not \nadhere to a majority of the principles of openness. It is derived \nfrom “greenwashing, ” where vendors opportunistically label \ntheir products “green” in the hope of increased sales. With the \nincreased focus on open access, we may expect not just an in-\ncreased commodification of openness [20], but also more \nconfusion as associated concepts, symbols, and language are \nco-opted or copied by various actors. \n Free lunches are hard to come by. Theoretically, a publisher \ncould deprive me of access to a “free” article before I had fin-\nished reading it; i.e., at any time. Hence, “bronze” seems too \nstrong a word. We need something that captures the fleeting, \nunfair, and asymmetrical nature of power that this type of ac-\ncess embodies. One that shows that individuals—both readers \nand authors—derive benefits only when and for as long as \nthey serve those of the publisher. Perhaps the “fourrée, ” the \nancient Greek or Roman term for counterfeit coin? A fourrée \ncomprised base metals coated in gold or silver. It was crafted \nto fool an unsuspecting purchaser too eager to trust a gleam-\ning exterior. It may prove an apt metaphor for so-called \nbronze or free access articles.\nConclusion \nWhatever we call these articles—bronze, free, or fourrée— it \nis vital that we have an open and critical debate about what \nthey are and whose purposes they most serve. The language \nand concepts of both freedom and openness are contestable, \nand we would do well to engage critically in this debate. This \nessay has sought to shine a light on some of the issues in-\nvolved and hopefully stimulate further discussion amongst \nscholars and publishers about this pressing topic.\nFig. 1.
