It is als o the largest barrier hindering the \napplication of power electronic transformers in industry. In th is paper, the state of power electronic \ntransformers is fully presented in terms of efficiency improvem ents. It is followed by the efficiency \nmodeling of several typical topologies, and their detailed anal ysis and comparisons. Then, the \ncorresponding industrial application scope of these topologies is presented, providing theoretical \nguidance for their industrial applications. \nKeywords:  Power electronic transformer, topology, efficiency, modeling. \n1  Introduction \nIt is well known that smart grid and energy internet \nare the main power system focuses in the coming future. \nIt is also known that renewable sources such as solar \nphotovoltaic(PV) and wind energy will play a very \nimportant role in smart grid and energ y internet [1-2] . \nDue to the intermittent featur es of renewable resources, \nthere are many technical problems should be solved \nbefore entering smart grids, i.e., high efficiency and \nstabilization, which also raises many challenges for \npower electronics techniques\n[3-4]. For example, power \ntransformers are one of the most important components. \nIn smart grids, power transformers are required to deal \nwith features of fault isolation, power quality control, \nharmonic suppression and other functions\n[5-7] . The \ntraditional transformers in power grids are realized with \nmagnetically coupled metals, so there are many obvious \ndisadvantages, i.e. large volume, heavy weight, heavy \npollution, high economic cost and high energy loss, \nwhich easily fulfill the requirements of smart grid and \nenergy internet. It should be mentioned that the largest \nshortcoming is the fact that the traditional one's \nefficiency can only realize 60% at maximum. Therefore, \nit is necessary to further develop and investigate new \npower transformers to overcome the aforementioned \nshortcomings\n[8-10]. \nWith the development of power electronic \ntechniques and their controls, a totally-new transformer, \npower electronic transformers(PET), is proposed by the \nAmerican Institute of Electric Power in 1995 for \nrealizing voltage transformation and energy transfer in \npower system through power electronic transformation \ntechnology, and is getting more and more attention\n[11]. \nPET not only has the functions of transformation, \nisolation and energy transmission of traditional power \ntransformers, but also has the functions of power factor \ncorrection, power flow control, power quality \nimprovement, system operation monitoring and AC/DC \npower interface. To date, PET has played an important \nand indispensable role in realizing smart grid and energy \ninternet\n[12-14] .     \nIt is followed by a structure of power electronic \ntransformer based on direct AC-AC conversion    \nand high-frequency isolation, proposed in 1999 [15]. \nCompared with the traditional transformer, the improved \nPET has a smaller size, lighter weight, and higher \nefficiency. In 2000, ABB researchers proposed a \nthree-phase AC-AC buck-boost converter\n[16]. The PET \nhas a simple structure, easier control and fewer power \ndevices, so its efficiency is improved. Restricted by \npower electronic power devices, the above AC-AC \npower electronic transformer topologies only apply to \nsmall power occasions. With the development of power \nelectronic techniques and power electronic devices in \nrecent years, domestic and foreign researchers have put \nforward a variety of PET topologies for high power \noccasions. In 2007, a 270kV A solid state transformer \nbased on 10kV SiC power MOSFET has been proposed. \nIts capacity, frequency, AC input and DC output are \n1.2MV A, 16.7Hz, 15kV , 800V , respectively, which have \nbeen implemented in railway traction field\n[17]. Owing to \nthe ZVS turn-on of most switches, the losses in the SiC \nMOSFET and diodes are significantly reduced compared \nto hard-switched converters. In [18], a high-voltage \nhigh-frequency transformer design for a 7.2kV to \n120V/240V 20kV A solid state transformer was proposed \nin 2010. The power electronic transformer has a high \nintegration degree and few switching devices. Moreover, \nthe low voltage side is reserved with a DC bus interface, \nwhich is then easy to power the DC load. \nAfter decades of development, PET has encountered \na bottleneck, i.e., efficiency problems. Therefore, \nimproving the PET efficiency can greatly promote their \napplications and then can gradually replace bulky and \nhigh-cost power transformers. Therein, the topology of \nPET is the most critical factor in improving \nefficiency\n[19-20]. Switching loss takes up most of the \nentire loss of PET . Hence, it is the most straightforward \nway to improve PET efficiency, reducing both the \nnumber of switching tubes in the topology of PET and \nhence the switching loss. \n                         \n* Corresponding Author, Email: yun@gdut.edu.cn. \nSupported by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Provin ce\n(2017A030310243). \n \n G. Zhang et al.: A Critical Topology Review of Power Electroni c Transformers: In View of Efficiency 91 \nThis paper is organized as follows: In section 2, the \nefficiency model of PET is established and the efficient \nexpression of PET is derived. The structure and \nefficiency of several typical PET topologies are analyzed \nin Section 3. In Section 4, an impedance network PET \nstructure based on GaN and SiC devices is proposed. \nFinally, a conclusion is drawn in section 5. \n2  The efficiency model of PET \nThis section will analyze the topology of PET \nbased on optimum efficiency. Without considering the \nswitching loss, assume that the input and the output \nparameters of PET are U\n1/U2=I2/I1=N, the number of \nswitch tube on U1 side and U2 side are m and n, \nrespectively. Hypothesizing that the on-state voltage \ndrop of all switching tubes is v\nc. From U1 to U2, it will \nthrough multi-layer voltage transformation, and its \nproportional relation is U1/vi =ai, where vi i s  t h e  i-th \nvoltage transition from U1, a i is corresponding voltage \nr a t i o .

Finally, the switching loss expression in PET \ncan be expressed as:  \nloss c 1 c c\n0\nii\ni\nPm v I n N v b v i\n\n\n    \nc1 c1 c\n0\nii i\ni\nmv I nNv I a b v I\n\n\n           ( 1 )  \nTherefore, the efficiency expression is: \ncc c\nin loss 0\nin 1\n100% 1 100%\nii\ni\nmv nNv a b v\nPP\nPU\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n ( 2 ) \nFrom the Eq.(2), it can be concluded that the \nefficiency of PET is mainly determined by the following \nfactors. \n●  The input voltage ( U1). In the case where other \nparameters are unchanged, the higher the primary \nvoltage of the PET is, the higher the efficiency is. \nWhen the input voltage increases, the voltage stress \nof the electronic device also needs to be improved. \nHowever, as current elec tronic device technology \nhas difficulty dealing with high voltage stress, it is \nnecessary to connect multiple switch tubes to \nachieve voltage-sharing. \n●  The number of intermediate transformations ( i). When \ni=0, the voltage transformation is realized directly. As \nthe number of  i increases, its efficiency will decrease. \nThis parameter is determined by the type of topology. \n●  The number of switch tubes ( 0 iimn b\n\n  ) is one \nof the main factors that affect the efficiency of PET. \nThe number of switches in PET is determined by the \ntopological structure. Therefore, it is an important \nm e t ho d  t o i m p r o ve  P E T  e f f i c i e nc y  by  i m p r o vi n g t h e  \nPET topology, especially reducing the number of \nswitch tubes. \n●  PET ratio ( N). When the ratio is larger, the loss will \nbe larger and the efficiency will be lower. \n●  Switch on-state voltage drop ( vc). When the value is \nsmaller, the efficiency of PET will be higher. This \nparameter is determined by the semiconductor \nparameters. \n●  The factors that affect PET efficiency also include \nw h e t h e r  s o f t  s w i t c h i n g  a r e  i m p l e m e n t e d  i n  t h e  \nconverter\n[21-23] . \nIn view of the above analysis, the following \nsections will focus on efficiency analysis on various \ntopological structures and obtain the corresponding \ntheoretical efficiency expressions. \n3  Topology analysis of PET transformer \nbased on optimal efficiency \nThis section will focus on efficiency, concluding \nand analyzing the structure of several typical topologies. \n3.1  AC buck PET \nIn 1995, a research project sponsored by the \nAmerican Institute of Electric Power developed \nsolid-state transformer based on AC-AC conversion [11]. \nAs shown in Fig.1, the diodes and switch tubes of the \ntraditional Buck circuit are replaced by a switch module \nand a switch module. There, each switch module has \nfour switch tubes respectively. By changing the \nconnection and control mode of the circuit, it can realize \nthe functions of AC chopping control voltage regulation, \nsingle-phase bridge rectifie r, Single-phase ac voltage \nregulator, and other functions. The circuit structure is \nsimple and easy to implement, but has no electrical \nisolation cannot inhibit current harmonics and achieve \npower factor control (PFC). \nAccording to the Eq.(2), the efficiency expression \nof the AC buck converter of PET is as follows:  \ncc c\n0\n1\n11 0 0 %\nii\ni\nmv nNv a b v\nU\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \ncc\n11\n41 100% 1 100%mv v\nUU\n     \n \n    ( 3 )  \nFrom the Eq.(3), it can be concluded that the \nefficiency of this type is only related to the input voltage \nand the parameter of switches. Similarly, the same \nmethod can be applied to Boost, Buck-Boost, Cuk,  \n \nFig.1  AC buck converter of PET \n \n92 Chinese Journal of E lectrical Engineeri ng, Vol.4, No.2, June  2018  \nSepic converters, etc. The method is to replace the \ncorresponding switches and diodes as bidirectional \nswitch modules. \n3.2  Flyback PET \nThe flyback topology of PET is shown in Fig.2. It \nis based on the isolation buck-boost converter topology, \nwhich only has two switch modules and can realize the \nfunction of increasing voltage and reducing voltage\n[16]. \nHowever, the PET has a large harmonic voltage and \nintermittent current. \nAccording to Eq.(2), the efficiency expression of \nthe flyback topology of PET can be obtained as follows: \ncc c\n0\n1\n11 0 0 %\nii\ni\nmv nNv a b v\nU\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \ncc c c\n11 2\n1 100% 1 100%vN v v v\nUU U\n       \n \n ( 4 )  \nAccording to Eq.(4), the efficiency of this type of \ntopology of PET is associated with the input and output \nvoltage and the parameter of the switches. When the \ninput and output voltage is high, its efficiency can be \nenhanced significantly. However, when the current is \nlarger, the leakage inductance of the transformer will be \nlarger. Therefore, the circuit is appropriate for high- \nvoltage, small-current and low-power occasions. \nSimilarly, the analytical method and the efficiency \nestimation formula are also suitable for the Forward \ntopology of PET. \n3.3  AC-AC-AC PET \nAn AC-AC-AC transformer is shown in Fig.3. This \ntopology was first proposed by Texas A&M University \nin 1999\n[15]. The topology is composed of high-frequency \ntransformers and two H-bridge circuits of the primary \nand the secondary side. Each switch unit of H-bridge \nis composed of two IGBT modules to realize the \nbidirectional flow of energy. According to Eq.(2), the \ncorresponding efficiency estimation formula can be \nobtained: \ncc c\n0\n1\n11 0 0 %\nii\ni\nmv nNv a b v\nU\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \ncc c c\n11 2\n44 4 41 100% 1 100%vN v vv\nUU U\n         \n  \n ( 5 ) \n \nFig.2  Flyback topology of PET \n \nFig.3  AC-AC-AC topology of PET  \nFrom Eq.(5), it can be concluded that the efficiency \nis related to the input voltage, the output voltage and the \nparameter of switches. The circuit of this topology of \nPET is complex and has high power loss because of the \nlarge number of devices (16 switches). \n3.4  Matrix PET \nAs showed in Fig.4, the three-phase matrix \ntopology of PET includes t he modulation stage and \nthe phase change phase [24]. The average voltage is \nmodulated by the modulation phase, and then the \nvoltage transformation is carried out. The topology can \nrealize AC-AC transformatio n well and the voltage and \ncurrent are continuous, while the circuit has more \nswitches. \nAccording to Eq.(2), we can get the efficiency of \nthe expression as follow: \ncc c\n0\n1\n1 100%\nii\ni\nmv nNv a b v\nU\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \ncc c c\n11 2\n46 4 61 100% 1 100%vN v vv\nUU U\n         \n  \n ( 6 )  \nFrom Eq.(6), it can be concluded that the efficiency \nis related to the input voltage, the output voltage and the \nparameter of switch tube device. Compared with the \nAC-AC-AC topology of PET, the topology has complex \ncontrol and stable output voltage. \n3.5  AC-DC-AC PET \nThe typical AC-DC-AC topology of PET is shown \nin Fig.5 [25]. The topology is highly sensitive to the \nleakage inductance and has a large number of switches. \n \nFig.4  Three-phase matrix topology of PET \n \n G. Zhang et al.: A Critical Topology Review of Power Electroni c Transformers: In View of Efficiency 93 \n \nFig.5  AC-DC-AC topology of PET \nAccording to Eq.(2), the  efficiency estimation \nexpression can be obtained as: \ncc c\n0\n1\n11 0 0 %\nii\ni\nmv nNv a b v\nU\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \ncc 1 c\n1\n43 21 100%vN va v\nU\n  \n\n       ( 7 )  \nFrom Eq.(7), it can be concluded that the efficiency \nof this topology is low because it has more power \nconversion links than the AC-AC-AC topology of PET. \n3.6  Dual DC link PET \nIn order to solve the problems of the AC-DC-AC \ntopology of PET, the AC-DC-AC-DC-AC dual DC link \ntopology of PET is proposed. The system frame diagram \nis shown in Fig.6. First of all, the input is rectified into \nthree-phase DC voltage, and then, to achieve single-phase \ninverter transformation. Then, the voltage is coupled to \nthe secondary side by the high-frequency transformer to \nrealize the single-phase transformation of the voltage. \nFinally, three-phase inverter is utilized to obtain the \nrequired three-phase ac voltage\n[16] .The circuit diagram \ni s  s h o w n  i n  F i g . 7 .  C o m p a r e d  w i t h  t h e  A C - D C - A C  \ntopology of PET, this topology adds two circuits for \nenhances the controllability.  However, the circuit is \ndifficult to realize and has some problems such as \nvoltage-sharing of the switch. \nAccording to Eq.(2), the efficiency expression can \nbe obtained as: \ncc c\n0\n1\n11 0 0 %\nii\ni\nmv nNv a b v\nU\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \ncc 1 c 2 c\n1\n33 2 21 100%vN va va v\nU\n  \n\n   ( 8 )  \n \nFig.6  Dual DC link t opology of PET system  \nframework diagram \n \nFig.7  Dual DC link topology of PET \nFrom Eq.(8), it can be concluded that, compared \nw i t h  t h e  A C - D C - A C  t o p o l o g y  o f  P E T ,  t h e  d u a l  D C  \ntopology of PET has lower efficiency and higher \ncontrollability. \n4  Example: impedance network PET \nstructure based on GaN and SiC devices \nIn view of the aforementioned problems, it can be \nconcluded that the current P ET topological structure still \nhas the following problems that affect the efficiency and \nstability of PET, thus restrict ing the application of PET \nin industry and life\n： \n●  Large amount of electronic device. The topology of \nPET has many electronic devices, especially the \nnumber of switches. It will  increase the loss of the \ntransformer and reduce effic iency. At the same time, it \nwill increase the control circuit and complexity of the \ns y s t e m .      \n●  Electronic device limitations. At present, more \ncommon full-control electronic devices are IGBT and \nMOSFET. Affected by the current technology, the \ncorresponding high switching losses affect the \noverall efficiency of the transformer. Moreover,    \nthe corresponding voltage and current stress of \nthese switches are limited and difficult to use for \nhigh-voltage and high-capacity occasions.        \n●  Low voltage conversion ratio . The voltage conversion \nratio of the traditional pow er transformer is limited by \nthe turns ratio of the primary and secondary windings, \nwhich in turn affects the transformer size. The \ntransformation ratio of PET is related to the \nbuck-boost ratio of the buck-boost circuits. The \ncurrent solution is to cascade multiple buck-boost \ncircuits or to change the high-frequency transformer \nvoltage conversion ratio. However, these solutions \nwill increase the number of  switches on the converter \nor increase its volume and complexity, so PETs \nefficiency has been affected. \n●  Low voltage and power level. The existing PET \ntopologies have problems of low voltage and power \n \n94 Chinese Journal of E lectrical Engineeri ng, Vol.4, No.2, June  2018  \nlevels due to the influenc e of maximum withstand \nvoltage and current parameters of single switch. Only \nthe MMC topology can realize high-voltage and \nhigh-power conversion. \n●  Low stability. A large number of switches cause the \ncorresponding control circuits to be complicated. \nMoreover, electromagnetic interference of high power \ncircuit will make the switch control turn on or turn off \na t  m i s t a k e s ,  w h i c h  w i l l  l e a d  t o  t h e  c o l l a p s e  o f  t h e  \nwhole transformer. Therefore, the stability of the \nconverter is also one of th e problems to be solved. \nIn view of the above problems, an impedance \nnetwork topology of PET based on GaN and SiC \nelectronic devices is proposed, and its frame structure is \nshown in Fig.8. The introduction of impedance network \ncan realize single-pole high voltage transformer ratio, \navoid switching tube shoot thr ough and achieve isolation. \nThe introduction of GaN and SiC devices can greatly \ndecrease the switching power  loss under high-power and \nlarge-capacity conditions, thereby greatly improving the \nefficiency of PET. \nAs showed in Fig.8, the imp edance network and the \nmatrix converter can be various types of impedance \nnetworks, and one of them is shown in Fig.9. \n5  Conclusion \nPET has received increasing attention from both \nindustry and academia for applications in smart grid and \nthe energy internet. In this paper, several typical PET \ntopologies are modeled, analyzed and compared in detail. \nThen, current problems affecting PET efficiency and \nstability are summarized and corresponding solutions are  \n \nFig.8  Impedance network PET structure based on  \nGaN and SiC devices \n \nFig.9  A circuit diagram of i mpedance network three-phase \nmatrix PET based on GaN a nd SiC electronic devices \nderived.
