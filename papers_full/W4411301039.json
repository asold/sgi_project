Radiation Oncology          (2025) 20:101 \nIntroduction\nChatGPT is an advanced large language model (LLM) \ndeveloped by OpenAI© designed to generate human-\nlike text based on the input it receives. (https:// openai.  \ncom/ index/ chatg pt/) In the medical field, its potential \napplications range from streamlining administrative \nprocesses to analyzing large datasets faster, integrating \nin telemedicine platforms or assisting patient education \n[1]. Many studies have attempted to assess the accuracy \nof medical information provided by ChatGPT to under -\nstand the extent to which it may pose a safety concern \n[2–4]. Its rising popularity increases the likelihood of \npatients turning to chatbots for medical inquires, since \nat least 59% of European citizens use the internet for \nhealth-related searches [5 ].\nThis study aimed to evaluate how patients who have \nundergone radiation therapy for meningioma perceived \ndisease-related information generated by ChatGPT. By \nincorporating both patient feedback and clinical assess -\nment, the study provides a comprehensive evaluation of \nChatGPT’s potential as a tool for educating meningi -\noma patients in the field of radiation oncology.\nMeningiomas are predominantly benign tumors aris -\ning from the meninges, the protective layers surround -\ning the brain and spinal cord. They account for 20% of \nall primary brain tumors and exhibit a 10-year overall \nsurvival of up to 80–90% especially in patients with \nlow-grade meningiomas. Despite the favorable prog -\nnosis, the growth and location of meningiomas can sig -\nnificantly impact adjacent brain structures, resulting in \na range of symptoms that can impact the quality of life. \nTreatment primarily aims to relieve acute symptoms or \nprevent further growth [6 ].\nGiven the complexity of treatment options, including \nsurgery or radiation therapy techniques like stereotac -\ntic radiosurgery (SRS) and intensity-modulated radia -\ntion therapy (IMRT), it is essential for patients to have a \nclear understanding of their individual treatment plan, \nits benefits, and potential side effects for ensuring com -\npliance and completing the treatment safely. Radiation \ntherapy typically involves extended treatment courses, \nwith side effects that can emerge even six months post-\ntreatment. For meningioma patients, who often have \na long-life expectancy after diagnosis, it is essential \nto provide proper education to manage the long-term \neffects of radiation.\nMethods\nCreating the questionnaires to evaluate \nChatGPT‑generated information on meningioma\nEight disease-related inquiries concerning diagnosis, \ntreatment options and radiation therapy of meningiomas \nwere presented to ChatGPT 4 to generate responses. The \nfinal questionnaire included eight responses generated \nby ChatGPT 4 and five feedback items to score the util -\nity, accuracy and clarity of this information. Additionally, \ntwo feedback items were included to score the potential \nbenefits of having access to such information prior to \nundergoing radiation therapy, and how well the infor -\nmation matched patients’ actual experiences (Appendix \nTable 5, Fig. 3).\nReviewing quality of information via a questionnaire \nconducted with clinicians\nPrior to patient data collection, each of the eight \nresponses generated by ChatGPT 4 was rated by the nine \nclinicians from the department of radiation oncology of \nthe LMU Hospital with respect to their relevance, cor -\nrectness, and completeness on a five-point likert scale. \n(1-strongly disagree, 2-disagree, 3-neutral, 4-agree, \n5-strongly agree).\nConducting the questionnaire and data collection\n28 patients diagnosed with meningioma received the \nquestionnaire during their first follow-up visit after radi -\nation therapy, scheduled three months after the radio -\ntherapy treatment.\nParticipants were briefed on the study’s objectives and \non the confidentiality and voluntary nature of their par -\nticipation. Written consent was obtained for data collec -\ntion and analysis. Patients completed the questionnaire \nTable 1 Patient characteristics\nCharacteristic Number Percentage\nGender\nFemale 8 29\nMale 20 68\nHistologic classification\nNo data 5 18\nWHO °1 14 50\nWHO °2 8 29\nWHO °3 1 4\nFraction dose [Gy]\n1.8 23 82\n2.0 3 11\n5.0 2 7\nTotal dose [Gy]\n25 (5 fx) 2 7\n50.4 (28 fx) 2 7\n52.2 (29 fx) 6 21\n54 (30 fx) 9 32\n59.4 (33 fx) 6 21\n60 (30 fx) 3 11\nPage 3 of 12\nDehelean et al.

Data from completed questionnaires were \nsecurely compiled for analysis.\nEvaluation of three other large language models\nTo further explore the quality of medical information \nprovided by large language models, the eight disease-\nrelated questions were presented to other LLMs: Chat -\nGPT 4o mini (free version), Gemini Free and Gemini \nAdvanced (Appendix Table  6). Seven experienced clini -\ncians, blinded to the source of the responses, assessed \nthe relevance, accuracy, and completeness of all answers \nindividually using a five-point Likert scale (1-strongly \ndisagree, 2-disagree, 3-neutral, 4-agree, 5-strongly agree). \nSubsequently, the clinicians reviewed all the responses \nincluding the one from ChatGPT 4, to determine which \nresponse was the most accurate, eloquent, and compre -\nhensive overall among the four LLMs.\nResults\nPatient characteristics\nPatient characteristics are shown in Table  1. The study \ncohort consisted of 28 participants, the age ranging \nbetween 40 and 74 and the median age was 60. The gen -\nder distribution was skewed towards females, comprising \n68% of the cohort, while males accounted for the remain-\ning 28%. In terms of clinical characteristics 50%, 29% \nand 4% of the patients were classified as WHO Grade 1, \nWHO Grade 2 and WHO Grade 3 respectively. In 18% \nof cases, histological data were unavailable as the diagno -\nsis was based exclusively on radiological findings (MRI). \nRegarding treatment characteristics, 93% of the cohort \nunderwent normal fractionation therapy, receiving doses \nof 1.8 Gy (82%) or 2.0Gy (11%) up to a dose of 52.2–60.0, \nwhile only 7% received 5.0 Gy per fraction up to 25.0Gy.\nQuality assessment with the clinician form\nEach question was rated by clinicians regarding its rel -\nevance, correctness and completeness. The average Lik -\nert scores are listed in Table  2. The majority of the items \nwere rated with an average of ≥ 4 on the Likert scale in \nterms of relevance and correctness. However, five ques -\ntions received an average Likert score < 4 in terms of \ncompleteness.\nData collection with the patient questionnaire\nOver 90% of patients agreed that the information was \nclear, easy to understand, and accurate. Additionally, \nover 90% found the information consistent with their \nown experiences (Fig.  1). Regarding its potential as a \nprior-treatment educational resource, 65% believed the \ninformation would have been helpful in advance, though \none patient disagreed, and 31% were neutral. More than \n60% of patients trusted the information provided by \nChatGPT. Finally, 60% of patients indicated they would \nuse ChatGPT for further medical inquiries, while 19% \ndisagreed (Table 3).\nEvaluation of three other LLMs\nAmong the four LLMs evaluated, ChatGPT 4 and its \nnewer version, 4o mini, received the highest and nearly \nidentical scores, while Gemini Free scored the lowest \nbased on clinician assessments (Figure 2).\nAt least 50% of clinicians chose one of the two Chat -\nGPT versions from the four options for each question \nas the best LLM. Gemini was less frequently the first \nchoice with Gemini free being the least popular among \nclinicians (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThis study aimed to evaluate the potential accuracy and \nrelevance of ChatGPT in addressing medical questions \nrelated to meningioma therapy, as perceived by patients \nwho underwent radiation treatment. Additionally, the \nquality of information was reviewed by clinicians to \ndetermine whether ChatGPT could effectively support \npatient education and decision-making without posing a \nsafety risk.\nThe current literature has primarily focused on rat -\ning ChatGPT’s responses by experts [7 –10]. This \nstudy introduces also patient evaluations of ChatGPT-\ngenerated information on meningiomas. By enrolling \npatients who have already undergone radiation treat -\nment, the study offers a unique perspective based on \ntheir firsthand experience with treatment outcomes \nand side effects. Patients were asked to review the \ninformation after their first follow-up meeting ensur -\ning that acute toxicities had resolved and that they \nhad sufficient time to reflect on their treatment expe -\nrience. While one patient noted that the vocabulary \nof ChatGPT4 was difficult to read, most patients rated \nthe answers clear and easy to understand. This may \nbe biased by their prior exposure to medical termi -\nnology before and during the treatment. It should be \nnoted that previous studies already described the tone \nused by ChatGPT as professional and concise [1 ]. This \nraises the question of whether its tone contributes to \nits trustworthiness, since more than 60% of patients \nenrolled in this study stated that they trust the infor -\nmation received by ChatGPT 4. On the other hand, the \nfact that about 90% of patients agreed that the informa -\ntion provided was consistent with their own experience \nsurely also contributed to ChatGPT’s trustworthiness. \nPage 4 of 12Dehelean et al. Radiation Oncology          (2025) 20:101 \nAlthough patients completed the questionnaire after \nconsulting with our physicians —which may have influ -\nenced them to underestimate the value of the LLM—\nthey still gave high ratings to the information provided \nby ChatGPT-4.\nChatGPT was already investigated in various situa -\ntions as a tool for support in cancer patients. Its utility \nexpands from quick and free access to medical informa -\ntion to patient-friendly explanations of medical terms \nor side-effects [3, 8, 11]. This suggests that ChatGPT \ncan serve as an accessible source of concise, relevant \ninformation and help simplify medical vocabulary for \npatient education. Patients in our study agreed that the \ninformation provided by ChatGPT 4 about the radia -\ntion treatment of meningiomas would have been help -\nful beforehand, indicating its potential educational role \nprior to treatment. Decision aids have been shown to be \nhighly effective tools for both physicians and patients in \nthe medical decision-making process [12]. Our findings \nindicate that ChatGPT could serve as a valuable resource \nby offering neutral and unbiased information to support \nshared decision-making. By helping patients gain a bal -\nanced understanding of their treatment options, Chat -\nGPT can empower them to participate more confidently \nin discussions with their physicians. This approach has \nthe potential to significantly enhance patient education, \nas increased patient involvement in health decisions has \nbeen linked to improved medical outcomes [12].\nIn their review Lleras de Frutos et. al demonstrated \nthat internet use generally has a positive impact on the \npsychological well-being of cancer patients. However, \nthey also identified forums and social media platforms \nTable 2 Evaluation of responses generated by ChatGPT 4 to 8 medical questions (Q1–8) related to meningiomas according to \nexperienced radiation oncologists ‑ (Likert scores: 1 ‑ strongly disagree, 2 ‑ disagree, 3 ‑ neutral, 4 ‑ agree, 5 ‑ strongly agree)\nAverage Likert score (range) SD\nQ1: What are meningiomas?\nRelevance 5 (5–5) ± 0\nCorrectness 5 (5–5) ± 0\nCompleteness 4.2 (2–5) ± 0.9\nQ2: What are treatment options for meningiomas?\nRelevance 5 (5–5) ± 0\nCorrectness 4.6 (3–5) ± 0.7\ncompleteness 4.3 (4–5) ± 0.5\nQ3: What are the benefits of radiotherapy for meningiomas?\nRelevance 4.8 (4–5) ± 0.4\nCorrectness 4.3 (2–5) ± 0.9\nCompleteness 4.4 (4–5) ± 0.5\nQ4: How is radiotherapy administered to the brain area?\nRelevance 4.9 (4–5) ± 0.3\nCorrectness 4.7 (4–5) ± 0.5\nCompleteness 3.7 (2–5) ± 0.9\nQ5: What is stereotactic radiotherapy?\nRelevance 4.8 (4–5) ± 0.4\nCorrectness 4.4 (4–5) ± 0.5\nCompleteness 3.9 (2–5) ± 0.9\nQ6: What are typical side effects of meningioma radiation?\nRelevance 4.7 (2–5) ± 0.9\nCorrectness 4.9 (4–5) ± 0.3\nCompleteness 3.2 (2–4) ± 0.9\nQ7: What should you pay attention to during radiation therapy to the head?\nRelevance 4.1 (3–5) ± 0.7\nCorrectness 4.2 (2–5) ± 0.9\nCompleteness 3.7 (2–5) ± 0.8\nQ8: What should be considered after radiation treatment?\nRelevance 4.3 (0.7 3–5) ± 0.7\nCorrectness 4.4 (1.0 2–5) ± 1.0\nCompleteness 3.7 (2–5) ± 1.1\nPage 5 of 12\nDehelean et al.

This issue appears to \nbe particularly pronounced among older adults, who \nreported experiencing higher levels of anxiety and confu -\nsion after seeking medical information online. The con -\nfusion is likely attributable to the overwhelming volume \nof unfiltered information as well as the lack of specific -\nity in online resources [5]. Similarly, our study found that \n10% of meningioma patients included in the research \ndisagreed with the consistency of information provided \nby ChatGPT 4 when compared to their personal expe -\nriences. This divergence underscores the limitations of \nstandardized medical information in offering a nuanced \nand comprehensive understanding of individual condi -\ntions. To our surprise, ChatGPT refrained from offering \nvery detailed medical advice. While this can be seen as a \nlack of specificity, it also avoids misinformation by ensur-\ning that critical decisions—such as determining treat -\nment regimens—remain under the purview of qualified \nmedical specialists within the appropriate clinical con -\ntext. This observation is encouraging and may suggest an \nongoing improvement of ChatGPT, since older studies \nhad noted that ChatGPT might also generate fabricated \nunreal data [13].\nOverall, the five potential risks described by Liu et al., \nsuch as generating fake medical content, perpetuating \nbias, and raising privacy concerns, must still be consid -\nered when using LLMs. They discussed in their analysis \nthe challenges of training AI systems for workflows in \nradiology and proposed guidelines for implementation \nin clinical practice. The authors highlighted issues such \nas the lack of generalizability, limited reproducibility, \nand ethical concerns related to data privacy and the \npotential for biases embedded in training data [14]. On \nthis note, Leon et. al summarized the challenges posed \nspecifically by the use of ChatGPT in the medical sec -\ntor and proposed several ways of implementing the use \nof such a LLM safely, among which data protection and \nclear ethical guidelines [15]. Our study also proved that \nas LLMs should be used in optimizing the process of \npatient education only with rigorous professional – and \nhuman - oversight.\nThe additional clinician evaluation conducted in this \nstudy revealed that the responses generated by Chat -\nGPT 4 were medically correct and relevant, consistent \nwith findings from other studies on oncology-specific \ninformation [7, 10]. However, our clinicians were hesi -\ntant to consider the responses generated by ChatGPT 4 \nFig. 1 Patient ratings of the responses generated by ChatGPT included in the questionnaire\nTable 3 Patient ratings of the responses generated by ChatGPT: first value indicates patient count, second shows the percentage\nQ1 (N/%) Q2 (N/%) Q3 (N/%) Q4 (N/%) Q5 (N/%) Q6 (N/%) Q7 (N/%)\nStrongly disagree 0/0% 0/0% 0/0% 0/0% 1/4% 0/0% 2/7%\nDisagree 0/0% 2/7% 1/4% 0/0% 0/0% 2/7% 2/7%\nNeutral 1/4% 0/0% 4/15% 2/7% 2/29% 6/21% 6/21%\nAgree 12/43% 14/50% 10/37% 12/43% 6/21% 9/32% 8/29%\nStrongly agree 15/54% 12 /43% 12/44% 14/50% 13/46% 11/39% 10/36%\nPage 6 of 12Dehelean et al. Radiation Oncology          (2025) 20:101 \nregarding radiation treatment of meningiomas as com -\nplete, with only 3 out of 8 questions scoring an average \nof more than 4 on the Likert Scale. Notably, the response \nconcerning the radiotherapy-associated side effects \nscored the lowest score (3,2). This may be due to Chat -\nGPT’s tendency to provide general answers that do not \nadequately address the complexity of a certain treat -\nment administered to the brain. Considering the com -\nplex anatomy of the central nervous system, the range \nof expected side-effects both on short and long term can \nsignificantly vary based on the exact location of the men -\ningioma. While the answer provided by ChatGPT 4 did \nnot cover the full range of symptoms, it specified that the \nside-effects depend on the tumor localization. This raises \nthe question of whether ChatGPT could deliver a more \nspecific answer if provided with more detailed informa -\ntion about the localization and size of the meningioma. \nSo far, Haemmerli et. al assessed ChatGPT’s ability to \ndeliver treatment recommendations similar to those of \ninterdisciplinary tumorboards by presenting 10 glioma \ncases including data regarding the histology, localization \nand size. While ChatGPT was able to offer general treat -\nment recommendations for gliomas, it failed to specify \nthe radiation and chemotherapy regimen and to consider \nthe patient’s functional status for decision-making [16].\nFollowing the announcement of ChatGPT 4o mini \nand the rise of other LLMs, we conducted an evaluation \ncomparing the responses generated by three other large \nTable 4 Percentage of clinicians who chose the different LLMs providing the most appropriate responses in terms of correctness, \neloquence and comprehensiveness for each category\nChatGPT 4 (% of clinicians) ChatGPT 4o mini (% of \nclinicians)\nGemini free (% of \nclinicians)\nGemini advanced \n(% of clinicians) \n(%)\nQ1: What are meningiomas?\nCorrectness 100 0 0 0\nEloquence 57.1 14.3 0 28.6\nComprehensiveness 100 0 0 0\nQ2: What are treatment options for meningiomas?\nCorrectness 42.9 42.9 14.3 0\nEloquence 42.9 28.6 28.6 0\ncompRehensiveness 57.1 42.9 0 0\nQ3: What are the benefits of radiotherapy for meningiomas?\nCorrectness 71.4 28.6 0 0\nEloquence 57.1 28.6 0 14.3\nComprehensiveness 71.4 28.6 0 0\nQ4: How is radiotherapy administered to the brain area?\nCorrectness 71.4 28.6 0 0\nEloquence 28.6 57.1 0 14.3\nComprehensiveness 57.1 42.9 0 0\nQ5: What is stereotactic radiotherapy?\nCorrectness 42.9 57.1 0 0\nEloquence 42.9 57.1 0 0\nComprehensiveness 57.1 42.9 0 0\nQ6: What are typical side effects of meningioma radiation?\nCorrectness 42.9 42.9 0 14.3\nEloquence 28.6 42.9 14.3 14.3\nComprehensiveness 42.9 42.9 0 14.3\nQ7: What should you pay attention to during radiation therapy to the head?\nCorrectness 28 57.1 14.3 0\nEloquence 28.6 42.9 28.6 0\nComprehensiveness 42.9 42.9 14.3 0\nQ8: What should be considered after radiation treatment?\nCorrectness 42.9 28.6 14.3 14.3\nEloquence 57.1 28.6 14.3 0\nComprehensiveness 57.1 28.6 14.3 0\nPage 7 of 12\nDehelean et al. Radiation Oncology          (2025) 20:101 \n \nlanguage models (LLMs): ChatGPT 4o mini, Gemini free \nand Gemini advanced. The assessment revealed that while \nChatGPT 4o mini neither significantly outperformed nor \nunderperformed its predecessor, both versions of Chat -\nGPT were rated higher than Google’s Gemini models—\nboth the free and paid advanced versions—in terms of \ncorrectness, relevance, and completeness. The assess -\nment also revealed that over 50% of clinicians selected \nthe ChatGPT versions as the most appropriate for cor -\nrectness, eloquence, and comprehensiveness.\nOne limitation of this study is the small cohort size, \ninfluenced by various factors such as limited time avail -\nability. Moreover, the sample is disproportionately com -\nposed of female participants, likely reflecting the higher \nprevalence of meningiomas among women. While the \nlimited sample size constrains the generalizability of the \nfindings, the study nonetheless provides a foundational \nbasis for future prospective investigations involving \nlarger, more diverse cohorts. Subsequent studies should \nalso consider collecting data on participants’ educational \nbackgrounds and incorporating open-ended questions to \nfacilitate the inclusion of qualitative insights.\nA notable strength of this study lies in its combined \npatient and clinician perspectives, providing a more com-\nprehensive assessment of ChatGPT’s potential in patient \neducation. By evaluating how well AI-generated infor -\nmation meets patient needs for clarity and usefulness—\nwhile simultaneously verifying its medical accuracy, \ncompleteness, and relevance through clinical review—we \ncan gain deeper insight into how LLMs can be effectively \nintegrated into healthcare. Future research could assess \nthe robustness of large language models (LLMs) in more \ncomplex and uncertain clinical scenarios. Specifically, \nwithin the context of radiotherapy, the reliability of LLMs \nmay be evaluated in the assessment of acute toxicities. \nAdditionally, LLMs hold potential for integration into \ndecision-support frameworks aimed at facilitating shared \ndecision-making during physician–patient consultations.\nFurthermore, the study’s comparison of ChatGPT \nwith three other large language models underscores dif -\nferences in performance, reinforcing the value of rigor -\nous, multifaceted evaluations in guiding their safe and \noptimal implementation. Although the patient sample \nsize may be a limitation, this dual-perspective design \nremains pivotal in ensuring that both user experience \nand professional standards are addressed.\nConclusion\nThis study highlights ChatGPT’s potential as a tool for \neducating meningioma patients. Patients found the \ninformation clear, accurate, and relatable, while clini -\ncians noted limitations in completeness for detailed \ntreatment-specific information. Comparative analysis \nof ChatGPT and other LLMs revealed that ChatGPT \nversions consistently performed slightly better in cor -\nrectness, relevance, and comprehensiveness. Overall, \nour results demonstrate that ChatGPT can be a valu -\nable tool for patient education, serving as a preparatory \nresource for patient-provider discussions within the \nframework of shared decision-making for example. This \napproach could have the potential to improve patients’ \nconfidence and understanding of their condition, ulti -\nmately supporting more informed and collaborative \nhealthcare decisions.\nFig. 2 Average Likert scores among the eight disease‑related questions presented to different LLMs\nPage 8 of 12Dehelean et al.

What are meningiomas? Meningiomas are tumors that develop from the meninges, the protective layers of tissue \nthat surround the brain and spinal cord. They represent about one‑third of all primary brain \ntumors. Although the majority of these tumors are benign and slow growing, their size \nand location of growth can cause them to put pressure on critical brain structures. This \npressure can cause a variety of symptoms, including but not limited to headaches, visual \ndisturbances, hearing loss, memory problems, seizures, and motor dysfunction. In rare \ncases, meningiomas can be malignant or develop into more aggressive forms that grow \nfaster and are more likely to recur.\n2. What are treatment options for meningiomas? Treatment depends on several factors, including the size and location of the tumor, the rate \nof growth, the patient’s age and general health, and the specific symptoms. For smaller \nmeningiomas with no symptoms, expectant management with regular monitoring \nwith imaging may be the best option. For larger, symptomatic, or growing meningiomas, \nsurgical removal is usually the goal. If complete removal is not possible due to the location \nof the tumor or the risk to the patient would be too great, radiation therapy may be used \nalone or in combination with surgery. In some cases, drug treatments such as hormone \ntherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapies may also be considered.\n3. What are the benefits of radiotherapy for meningiomas? Radiotherapy, particularly modern techniques such as radiosurgery and intensity‑mod‑\nulated radiotherapy (IMRT), can play an important role in treating meningiomas that are \ndifficult to reach surgically or in patients who cannot undergo surgery. Radiotherapy can \nalso serve as an adjuvant treatment after incomplete surgical removal to reduce the risk \nof tumor recurrence. Advantages of radiotherapy include its non‑invasiveness and ability \nto target the tumor, which protects surrounding healthy tissue and reduces the likelihood \nof neurological damage.\n4. How is radiotherapy administered to the brain area? The process of radiation therapy begins with careful planning, in which imaging tech‑\nniques such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are \nused to determine the exact dimensions and location of the meningioma. Based on these \nimages, an individual treatment plan is created that specifies exactly how the radia‑\ntion dose should be distributed. The actual treatment takes place in a special room, \nwhere the patient lies on a table and wears a custom‑made mask to keep the head still \nduring the radiation application. The radiation is administered in several short sessions \nin which high‑energy rays are delivered specifically to the tumor while the patient lies still.\n5. What is stereotactic radiotherapy? Stereotactic radiotherapy is a specialized form of radiation therapy that delivers highly \nprecise radiation in a single high dose or over multiple fractions. It is called stereotactic \nradiosurgery (SRS) when it is performed in a single session and fractionated stereotactic \nradiotherapy (FSRT) when the dose is spread over multiple sessions. This method is par‑\nticularly useful for meningiomas that are in hard‑to‑reach locations or where surgery is too \nrisky. Stereotactic radiotherapy may also be an option for patients who experience a recur‑\nrence of their tumor.\n6. What are typical side effects of meningioma radiation? The side effects of radiation therapy for meningiomas can vary depending on the loca‑\ntion of the tumor and the dose administered. The most common short‑term side effects \ninclude fatigue, local hair loss on the head in the radiation field and skin irritation. In rare \ncases, swelling in the brain can occur, which can lead to headaches and other neurological \nsymptoms. Long‑term side effects can include cognitive changes, hormone imbalances \nand, in very rare cases, the development of secondary tumors.\n7. What should you pay attention to during radiation \ntherapy to the head?\nDuring radiotherapy, patients should be closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team \nconsisting of oncologists, radiotherapists, neurologists and other specialists as appropriate. \nIt is important that patients report any changes in their symptoms or general condition \nas these may require adjustments in the treatment plan. Good nutrition, adequate hydra‑\ntion and rest are crucial to support the body during the treatment phase. Patients should \nalso be sure to follow their skin care instructions to minimize skin irritation in the radiation \narea.\n8. What should be considered after radiation treatment? After radiotherapy is completed, regular follow‑up is essential to monitor the condition \nof the meningioma and respond early to any signs of regrowth. Patients should continue \nto have regular neurological assessments and seek support for cognitive or psychological \nchallenges as appropriate. It is also important to maintain a healthy lifestyle with a bal‑\nanced diet and appropriate physical activity to promote overall well‑being and aid \nrecovery.\nPage 9 of 12\nDehelean et al. Radiation Oncology          (2025) 20:101 \n \nFig. 3 Feedback form presented to patients including Likert scala \n(translated from German to English)\nTable 6 Responses generated by different LLM versions to the eight meningioma‑related inquires. The responses were adapted to \ncomply with a full text and translated to English with Google Translate for the purpose of this publication\n1. What are meningiomas?\nChatGPT 4.o Meningiomas are tumors that arise from the meninges, which are protective layers of tissue \nthat surround the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas are among the most common pri‑\nmary tumors of the central nervous system, accounting for about 20‑30% of all brain tumors. \nThey tend to grow slowly and are mostly noncancerous (benign), although there may be \nrare, more aggressive forms. Because they grow slowly, they often go undetected for a long \ntime and only gradually cause symptoms. These symptoms depend on where in the brain \nor spinal cord they grow and how large they become.\nGemini free A meningioma is usually a benign tumor that originates from the meninges. These coverings \nprotect our brain. Meningiomas usually grow slowly and can reach different sizes. They often \nonly cause symptoms when they are larger.\nGemini advanced Meningiomas are usually benign tumors that arise from the meninges, the protective layers \nthat surround the brain and spinal cord. Although they usually grow slowly, depending \non their size and location, they can put pressure on the brain or nerves, causing various \nsymptoms.\n2. What are treatment options for meningiomas?\nChatGPT 4.o Treatment for meningiomas depends on the size, location, growth and patient symptoms. \nFor small, slow‑growing meningiomas with no symptoms, a \"watch‑and‑wait\" strategy \nis often used. This involves regular MRI monitoring of the tumor to monitor its growth. \nSurgery is often the first choice, especially if the tumor is causing symptoms or growing. \nThe goal is to remove the tumor completely, which is often possible with meningiomas \nbecause of their mostly benign nature. Radiotherapy is often an option if the tumor is inop‑\nerable, could not be completely removed or has grown back. It can control tumor growth \nand relieve symptoms. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a precise, high‑dose form of radiotherapy \nused for small tumors.\nGemini free The treatment of a meningioma depends on various factors, such as the size, the location \nof the tumor and the general health of the patient. Many meningiomas can be surgically \nremoved. Radiation is often used if complete surgical removal is not possible or if there \nis a fear that the tumor will recur. For small, slow‑growing tumors without symptoms, regular \nmonitoring may be sufficient.\nGemini advanced Treatment for a meningioma depends on several factors, such as the size, the location \nof the tumor, the age of the patient and the presence of symptoms. For small, asymptomatic \nmeningiomas, regular monitoring with MRI scans may be sufficient. Surgical removal is often \nthe first choice, especially for large or symptomatic tumors. Radiotherapy is used when sur‑\ngery is not possible or complete, or as an additional treatment after surgery.\nPage 10 of 12Dehelean et al. Radiation Oncology          (2025) 20:101 \nTable 6 (continued)\n3. How is radiotherapy administered to the brain area?\nChatGPT 4.o Radiotherapy offers several advantages for meningiomas. Unlike surgery, it does not require \nany incisions or tissue removal. Modern techniques such as stereotactic radiotherapy allow \nthe radiation to be targeted at the tumor, so that surrounding healthy tissue is largely spared. \nRadiotherapy can stop or slow the growth of tumors that cannot be completely removed \nsurgically or are inoperable. Radiotherapy is a good treatment option for patients who can‑\nnot undergo surgery due to age, general condition or location of the tumor.\nGemini free Radiotherapy can destroy tumor tissue and thus stop its growth or even reduce its size. \nCompared to surgery, radiotherapy is often less stressful for the patient. Modern radiation \ntreatments allow for very precise radiation of the tumor, thereby sparing healthy tissue. \nRadiation can be repeated if necessary.\nGemini advanced Radiotherapy is a gentle treatment without surgical intervention. Modern techniques enable \nhighly precise radiation that protects healthy tissue. Radiotherapy can stop tumor growth \nor shrink the tumor and thus alleviate or prevent symptoms. Treatment is usually carried \nout on an outpatient basis without the need for a hospital stay.\n4. How is radiotherapy administered to the brain area?\nChatGPT 4.o Before radiation therapy, a planning phase is carried out to precisely locate the tumor \nand determine the dose. This is done using imaging techniques such as MRI or CT. The \nradiation therapy itself is usually carried out in several sessions over several weeks. Each \nsession lasts only a few minutes, but precise preparation can take some time. The patient lies \non a treatment table during the treatment and the head is stabilized using a mask to ensure \nprecise alignment of the beams. The radiation source (usually a linear accelerator) moves \naround the patient’s head and delivers radiation to the tumor in a targeted manner. This \nradiation damages the DNA of the tumor cells, which stops their growth or causes them \nto die.\nGemini free During radiation therapy, high‑energy radiation is directed at the tumor. During the treat‑\nment, the patient is fixed in the head area with a special mask to ensure precise positioning. \nThe treatment usually only takes a few minutes and is painless.\nGemini advanced Before treatment, detailed planning is carried out using CT or MRI images to determine \nthe exact position of the tumor and the surrounding structures. The radiation is administered \nin several sessions over a certain period of time. During the radiation, you lie on a couch \nand a special machine directs the rays precisely at the tumor. Regular check‑ups dur‑\ning and after treatment are used to check the success of the therapy and to identify possible \nside effects.\n5. What is stereotactic radiotherapy?\nChatGPT 4.o Stereotactic radiation therapy, also called stereotactic radiosurgery, is a special form of radia‑\ntion therapy in which very precise, high‑dose beams are focused on the tumor. This method \nis often used for small, well‑defined tumors such as meningiomas. It allows for targeted \ndestruction of the tumor without severely affecting the surrounding healthy tissue. A major \nadvantage of stereotactic radiation therapy is that it can be performed in a few sessions (or \neven just a single session). It requires precise planning and imaging to ensure that the radia‑\ntion is precisely directed at the tumor.\nGemini free Stereotactic radiation therapy is a particularly precise form of radiation therapy. The tumor \nis displayed in three dimensions using imaging techniques (CT, MRI) and the rays are pre‑\ncisely aimed at the tumor tissue.\nGemini advanced Stereotactic radiation therapy is a highly precise form of radiation therapy in which several \nbeams are focused on the tumor from different directions. This enables a high dose to be \ndelivered to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue.\n6. What are typical side effects of meningioma radiation?\nChatGPT 4.o Side effects may occur but are usually mild and easily manageable. The frequency and sever‑\nity depend on the radiation dose, the duration of treatment, and the individual patient’s \ntolerance. Many patients feel fatigued during and after treatment. The skin in the irradiated \narea may become red or tender. Hair loss is common in the irradiated area but is usually tem‑\nporary. Some patients develop headaches, but these are usually easily manageable with pain \nmedication. In some cases, brain tissue near the irradiated area may swell, which can cause \nsymptoms such as nausea or neurological deficits. This is often treated with medications \nsuch as corticosteroids.\nGemini free Hair loss may occur in the irradiated area, but this usually recovers after treatment is com‑\npleted. Many patients feel tired during and after treatment. The skin in the irradiated area \nmay be red and irritated. Headaches are a common side effect. These side effects are usually \ntemporary and subside after treatment is completed.\nPage 11 of 12\nDehelean et al.

What should you pay attention to during radiation therapy to the head?\nChatGPT 4.o During radiation treatment, it is important to remain calm and follow the treatment team’s \ninstructions carefully. A special mask or holding device is used to ensure that the head \nremains in the correct position during treatment. Patients should immediately report any dis‑\ncomfort or side effects to the treatment team so that they can be treated in a timely manner. \nThe skin in the irradiated area should be treated gently. Avoid aggressive skin care products \nand protect the skin from direct sunlight.\nGemini free During treatment, regular check‑ups are carried out to monitor the progress of therapy \nand to detect possible side effects at an early stage. Skin in the irradiated area should be \ncarefully cared for. It is important to get enough rest and eat a healthy diet.\nGemini advanced It is important to follow all of the doctor’s instructions regarding preparation and treatment. \nDuring treatment, get enough rest and avoid physical exertion. Use mild skin care products \nand protect the irradiated skin from sunlight. Talk to your doctor about any complaints \nor questions you may have.\n8. What should be considered after radiation treatment?\nChatGPT 4.o Tiredness may persist for some time after treatment. It is important to take it easy and get \nenough sleep. The irradiated area may be sensitive even after treatment has finished, so skin \ncare should continue to be gentle and cautious. Regular check‑ups are important to monitor \nthe success of the treatment and to detect possible long‑term effects in good time.
