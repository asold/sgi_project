    "abstract": "Abstract In order to cope with the current engineering demand for increasing the current‐carrying capacity of resin impregnated paper (RIP) bushing, an optimization scheme of RIP bushing was proposed in this paper. Simulation and experimental studies were carried out to verify the rationality of the scheme. An improved simulation method was proposed. To ensure as much accuracy as possible, the physical model of simulation considers the influence of heat conduction, thermal convection and thermal radiation process according to the actual operation environment. To boost the computational efficiency, the improved method simplified the relationship between temperature and heating power of the current‐carrying conductor as a fitting formula to avoid the iterative calculation between electromagnetic field simulation and temperature field simulation. The temperature rise test was carried out according to the engineering requirement and the standard international electro technical commission (IEC) 60137:2008. The simulation and experimental results show that the RIP bushing can carry a current with the heating power of its conductor equivalent to that generated by a 50‐Hz current of 6736 A while running in a converter station. It is a breakthrough of the current‐carrying capacity of high voltage bushing. Meanwhile, the regularity of temperature distribution of the RIP bushing was discussed.",
