However, it also poses a more urgent chal -\nlenge to the unequal development of healthcare resources \nin global regions.\nCurrently, the relationship between LLMs and global \nregional development is still unclear. Therefore, this \nstudy aims to explore this issue.\nGlobal overview of the development of LLMs\nAmong all countries and regions worldwide, 86.7% of \ncountries and regions hold attention and application to \nthe LLMs (Fig.  1A), with 60.4% further reaping relevant \nsubsequent benefits (Fig. 1B).\nResource-rich countries and regions, such as China and \nIndia, or high-development countries and regions, such \nas USA, exhibit higher and more steady levels of attention \nand application (China = 12110, Ranked 1st; USA = 7372, \nRanked 2nd; India = 2744, Ranked 3rd ) toward the LLMs \nand furthermore receive more subsequent impacts \nJournal of Translational \nMedicine\n†Song-Bin Guo, Ying Shen and Yuan Meng are the joint first authors \nof this work.\n*Correspondence:\nXiu-Yu Cai\ncaixy@sysucc.org.cn\nWei-Juan Huang\nwjhuang@jnu.edu.cn\nXiao-Peng Tian\ntianxp@sysucc.org.cn\n1Department of Medical Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, \nGuangzhou 510060, P .

Journal of Translational Medicine           (2025) 23:706 \n(Fig.  2A-B). Other resource-related indicators likewise \ndemonstrate similar behavior patterns, such as regional \ngross domestic product, regional internet penetration \nrate and regional net electricity production (Fig.  2C-D \nand I-L).\nIn addition, in terms of development-related indicators, \nregions with a higher development index exhibit a higher \nlevel of attention and application ( R = 0.541, P < 0.001) \ntoward the LLMs and, consequently, a higher level of \nsubsequent impact ( R = 0.514, P < 0.001) from them, a \nbehavioral pattern that is more significant at the regional \neducation level (Fig. 2E-H).\nComprehensive analysis revealed that surge of LLMs \nexacerbates global regional inequalities in healthcare \nresources, highlighting the urgency and importance of \ntargeted policies and international assistance.\nResponding to global inequalities in healthcare \nresources exacerbated by the LLMs requires a strategy \nthat involves multiple levels and diverse stakeholders [ 1, \n2]. Firstly, infrastructure should be invested in less devel -\noped regions to provide the primary conditions for using \nthe LLMs. Secondly, local governments should formulate \npolicies to encourage the development and use of the \nLLMs. Finally, the relevant authorities should provide \neducation and training on the LLMs to generalize the \nknowledge of these technologies and provide hands-on \ntraining.\nIndeed, in low-resource or underdeveloped regions, \npromoting the relevant applications of the LLMs is of \nunusual significance. In resource-poor regions, LLMs \ncan help healthcare professionals gain more comprehen -\nsive medical knowledge and improve diagnostic accu -\nracy, thus alleviating the problem of insufficient medical \nresources to a certain extent [1, 3]. Nonetheless, there are \nalso diverse challenges in this regard [4].\nFig. 1 Global patterns of attention and application of LLMs in different geographical regions.
