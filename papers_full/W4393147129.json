The aforementioned assessment outcomes\nindicate that there is still a considerable journey ahead to ef-\nfectively apply RAG to LLMs.\nIntroduction\nRecently, there have been impressive advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) and\nChatGLM (THUDM 2023a). Although these models have\nshown remarkable general abilities (Bang et al. 2023; Guo\net al. 2023), they still suffer severely from challenges includ-\ning factual hallucination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes,\nand Junczys-Dowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023), knowledge out-\ndating (He, Zhang, and Roth 2022), and the lack of domain-\nspecific expertise (Li et al. 2023c; Shen et al. 2023).\nIncorporating external knowledge via information re-\ntrieval, i.e., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), has\nbeen regarded as a promising way to resolve the above chal-\nlenges.

With the help of external knowl-\nedge, LLMs can generate more accurate and reliable re-\nsponses. The most common method is to use a search engine\nas a retriever such as New Bing. Due to the vast amount of\ninformation available on the Internet, using a search engine\ncan provide more real-time information.\nHowever, Retrieval-Augmented Generation brings not\nonly positive effects to LLMs (Liu, Zhang, and Liang 2023;\nMaynez et al. 2020). On one hand, there is a significant\namount of noise information even fake news in the content\navailable on the Internet, which poses challenges for search\nengines in accurately retrieving desirable knowledge. On the\nother hand, LLMs suffer from unreliable generation chal-\nlenge. LLMs can be misled by incorrect information con-\ntained in the context (Bian et al. 2023) and also suffer from\nhallucination during the generation (Adlakha et al. 2023),\nresulting in generating content that goes beyond external in-\nformation. These challenges result in LLMs being unable to\nconsistently generate reliable and accurate responses. Un-\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n17754\nfortunately, currently there lacks of comprehensive under-\nstanding on how these factors can influence RAG, and how\ncould each model survives from these drawbacks and im-\nprovement their performance via information retrieval. As a\nresult, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive evalua-\ntion of LLMs on their ability to effectively utilize retrieved\ninformation, as well as their ability to withstand the various\ndrawbacks present in information retrieval.\nTo this end, this paper conducts a comprehensive evalua-\ntion of RAG for current LLMs. Specifically, we create a new\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark, namely RGB,\nin both English and Chinese. In order to ensure that the in-\nternal knowledge of LLMs does not introduce bias into the\nevaluation results, RGB chooses to aggregate the latest news\ninformation and constructs queries based on the news infor-\nmation. Then, based on these queries, we use Search API to\nfetch relevant documents and select most relevant snippets\nfrom the content as external retrieved documents. Finally,\nbased on different compositions of query and document-set\npairs, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to\nevaluate the following basic abilities of LLMs according to\nthe common challenges in RAG, as shown in Figure 1:\n• Noise Robustness, which means a LLM can extract use-\nful information from noisy documents. In this paper, we\ndefine noisy documents as those that are relevant to the\nquestion but do not contain any information of the an-\nswer. For the instance in Figure 1, the noisy documents\nrelated to the question “Who was awarded the 2022 No-\nbel Prize in Literature” include reports about the 2021\nNobel Prize in Literature. To this end, the testbed for\nnoise robustness contains instances whose external doc-\numents contain a certain number of noisy documents\nbased on the desired noise ratio.\n• Negative Rejection, which means that a LLM should re-\nject to answer the question when the required knowledge\nis not present in any retrieved document. The testbed for\nnegative rejection contains instances whose external doc-\numents are only with noisy documents. LLMs are ex-\npected to indicate “insufficient information” or other re-\njection signals.\n• Information Integration, which evaluates whether\nLLMs can answer complex questions that require inte-\ngrating information from multiple documents. For the in-\nstance in Figure 1, for the question “When were the Chat-\nGPT app for iOS and ChatGPT api launched?”, LLMs\nare expected to provide information of the launch dates\nfor both the ChatGPT iOS app and ChatGPT API. The\ntestbed for information integration contains instances\nthat can only be answered using multiple documents.\n• Counterfactual Robustness, which evaluates whether\nLLMs can identify risks of known factual errors in the\nretrieved documents when the LLMs are given warnings\nabout potential risks in the retrieved information through\ninstruction. The testbed for counterfactual robustness in-\ncludes instances that can be answered directly by the\nLLMs, but the external documents contain factual errors.\nBased on RGB, we conduct evaluation on 6 state-of-\nthe-art large language models including ChatGPT (Ope-\nnAI 2022), ChatGLM-6B (THUDM 2023a), ChatGLM2-\n6B (THUDM 2023b), Vicuna-7b (Chiang et al. 2023),\nQwen-7B-Chat (Bai et al. 2023), BELLE-7B (BELLEGroup\n2023). We found that even though RAG can improve the re-\nsponse accuracy of LLMs, they still suffer from the above-\nmentioned challenges significantly. Specifically, we found\nthat even though LLMs demonstrate some level of noise ro-\nbustness, they tend to confuse similar information and fre-\nquently generate inaccurate answers when relevant informa-\ntion exists. For example, when faced with a question about\nthe 2022 Nobel Prize in Literature, if there are noisy docu-\nments about the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature in external\ndocuments, LLMs may become confused and provide inac-\ncurate answers. Besides, LLMs frequently fail to reject an-\nswering and generate incorrect answers when none of the\nexternal documents contain relevant information. Further-\nmore, LLMs lack the ability to summarize from multiple\ndocuments, and therefore if multiple documents are needed\nto answer a question, LLMs often fail to provide accurate\nanswer. Finally, we found that even when the LLMs contain\nthe required knowledge and are given warnings about po-\ntential risks in the retrieved information through instruction,\nthey still tend to trust and prioritize the retrieved information\nover their own existing knowledge. The experimental results\nmentioned above highlight the need for further resolution of\nimportant issues in the existing RAG method. Therefore, it\nis crucial to exercise caution and carefully design its usage.\nGenerally speaking, the contributions of this paper are1:\n• We proposed to evaluate four capabilities for retrieval-\naugmented generation of LLMs and created the\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark in both En-\nglish and Chinese. To best of our knowledge, it is the first\nbenchmark designed to assess these four capabilities for\nretrieval-augmented generation of LLMs.\n• We evaluated the existing LLMs using RGB and found\nthe limitations of them in the four different abilities.\n• We analyzed the responses of LLMs in RGB and identi-\nfied their current shortcomings as well as suggested di-\nrections for improvement.\nRelated Work\nRetrieval-augmented models The knowledge stored in\nlarge language models is commonly out-of-date (He, Zhang,\nand Roth 2022) and they also sometimes generate hallu-\ncination (Cao et al. 2020; Raunak, Menezes, and Junczys-\nDowmunt 2021; Ji et al. 2023) i.e., they may generate ir-\nrelevant or factually incorrect contents. By using external\nknowledge as guidance, retrieval-augmented models can\ngenerate more accurate and reliable responses (Guu et al.\n2020; Lewis et al. 2020; Borgeaud et al. 2022; Izacard\net al. 2022; Shi et al. 2023; Ren et al. 2023). Retrieval-\naugmented models have achieved remarkable results in var-\nious tasks such as open-domain QA (Izacard and Grave\n2021; Trivedi et al. 2023; Li et al. 2023a), dialogue (Cai\net al. 2019a,b; Peng et al. 2023), domain-specific ques-\ntion answering (Cui et al. 2023) and code generation (Zhou\n1Our code&data: https://github.com/chen700564/RGB.\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n17755\nNews CollectionNews about The 2022 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine\nData adjustment and filtering by Human\n{   “Question”: “Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine?”,   “Answer”: ['Svante Pääbo','Svante Paabo’]}\nData generation by ChatGPT\nRetrieve using search engine\nRerank by dense retrieval model\nWe simulate the process of a user querying and obtaining information.. ……News: The 2022 Nobel Prize for …\nRelated event: … \\nQuestion:… \\nKey information:…gpt-3.5-turbo api\nQuery: Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine?”,\n{\"link\": \"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/\", ...Google Search API\nChun2ChunkQueryDense retrieval modelTop1 Chunk Top30 ChunkTop2 Chunk……\n……\nFigure 2: The process of data generation.

Finally, a dense retrieval model is employed to\nre-rank the content of these web pages.\net al. 2023b). Recently, with the development of large mod-\nels, a series of retrieval-enhanced tools and products have\ngained widespread attention, such as ChatGPT retrieval plu-\ngin, Langchain, New Bing, etc. However, in real-world sce-\nnarios, the retrieved text inevitably contains noise. There-\nfore, in this paper we conducted a systematic evaluation and\nanalysis of retrieval-augmented generation in LLMs.\nEvaluation of LLMs Evaluating LLMs has received sig-\nnificant attention due to their remarkable general capabil-\nity (Chang et al. 2023). It enables us to gain a deeper under-\nstanding of the specific abilities and limitations of LLMs,\nwhile also providing valuable guidance for future research.\nIn the past, benchmarks such as GLUE (Wang et al. 2019b)\nand SuperCLUE (Wang et al. 2019a) primarily focused on\nevaluating NLP tasks, particularly in natural language un-\nderstanding. However, these evaluations often fail to fully\ncapture the capabilities of LLMs. MMLU (Hendrycks et al.\n2021) was then proposed to measure the knowledge acquired\nby language models when pre-training. Recently, with the\ndevelopment of LLMs, a series of general evaluation bench-\nmarks have emerged, such as AGIEval (Zhong et al. 2023),\nC-Eval (Huang et al. 2023), AlpacaEval (Li et al. 2023b),\nOpenLLM Leaderboard (Edward Beeching 2023), etc. In\naddition to general abilities, there are also specific bench-\nmarks that focus on evaluating the capabilities of models.\nFor example, CValues (Xu et al. 2023a) focuses on the safety\nand responsibility of LLMs, M3Exam (Zhang et al. 2023)\nfocuses on human exam and ToolBench (Qin et al. 2023)\nevaluates how well LLMs use external tools. Recently, Ad-\nlakha et al. (2023) evaluate the RAG of LLMs in exist QA\ndataset. Different from their work, we focus on 4 required\nabilities of RAG and create Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion Benchmark to evaluate the LLMs.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation Benchmark\nIn this section, we first introduce the specific retrieval-\naugmented generation abilities we aim to evaluate. Next, we\noutline the process of constructing the RAG benchmark for\nevaluation. Lastly, we present the evaluation metrics.\nRequired Abilities of RAG\nExternal knowledge is the key to resolving the problems\nof LLMs such as hallucination and outdated knowledge,\nwhich can make LLMs generate more accurate and reliable\nresponses through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nHowever, LLMs cannot always response as expected with\nRAG. For one thing, there are numerous irrelevant docu-\nments and false information on the Internet. Incorporating\nthese external documents into LLMs could have a detrimen-\ntal effect. For anthoer, LLMs suffer from the unreliable gen-\neration challenge. The generation of LLMs is often unpre-\ndictable, and we cannot guarantee that they will utilize the\nuseful information entailed in the external documents. Ad-\nditionally, LLMs can easily be misled by incorrect infor-\nmation in the document. To this end, we build Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation Benchmark (RGB) to evaluate the\nretrieval-augmented generation of LLMs, and we concern\nabout 4 specific abilities:\nNoise Robustness is the robustness of LLMs in noisy\ndocuments. As retrievers are not perfect, the external knowl-\nedge they retrieve often contains a significant amount of\nnoise, i.e., documents which are relevant to the question but\ndo not contain any information about the answer. To effec-\ntively answer user questions, LLMs must be able to extract\nthe necessary information from documents despite there are\nnoisy documents.\nNegative Rejectionis a measure of whether LLMs can\ndecline to answer a question when none of the contexts pro-\nvide useful information. In real-world situations, the search\nengine often fails to retrieve documents containing the an-\nswers. In these cases, it is important for the model to have\nthe capability to reject recognition and avoid generating mis-\nleading content.\nInformation Integration is a capacity to integrate an-\nswers from multiple documents. In many cases, the an-\nswer to a question may be contained in multiple documents.\nFor example, for the question “Who are the champions of\nthe U.S. Open 2022 men’s and women’s singles?”, the two\nchampions may be mentioned in different documents. In or-\nder to provide better answers to complex questions, it is nec-\nessary for LLMs to have the ability to integrate information.\nCounterfactual Robustnessrefers to a capacity to han-\ndle errors in external knowledge. In the real world, there is\nan abundance of false information on the internet. Please\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n17756\nnote that we only evaluate the situation that LLMs are given\nwarnings about potential risks in the retrieved information\nthrough instruction.\nIn real-world scenarios, it is not possible to obtain per-\nfect documents with all the necessary external knowledge.\nTherefore, evaluating these four abilities of the model be-\ncomes essential in order to measure the RAG of LLMs.\nData Construction\nInspired by previous benchmarks for LLMs, RGB utilizes\na question-answering format for evaluation. We evaluate the\nLLMs by judging the retrieval-augmented responses of them\nto the questions. To simulate real-world scenarios, we con-\nstruct question and answer data using actual news articles.\nDue to the abundance of knowledge contained within the\nLLMs there is a potential for bias when measuring the first\nthree abilities. To mitigate this, the instances of RGB are\nconstructed by latest news articles. Additionally, we retrieve\nexternal documents from Internet through search engines.\nFinally, we expand the corpus and divided it into 4 testbeds\nto evaluate the above basic abilities of LLMs. The overall\nprocedure of our data construction is illustrated in Figure 2.\nQA instances generation.We first collect latest news ar-\nticles and use prompts to make ChatGPT generate events,\nquestions, and answers for each articles. For example, as\nshown in the Figure 2, for a report about “The 2022 Nobel\nPrize”, ChatGPT will generate corresponding event, ques-\ntion and provide key information for answering it. By gen-\nerating events, the model is able to preliminarily filter out\nnews articles that do not contain any events. After genera-\ntion, we manually check the answer and filter out data that\nis difficult to retrieve through search engines.\nRetrieve using search engine.For each query, we use\nGoogle’s API to fetch 10 relevant web pages and extract cor-\nresponding snippets of text from them. Simultaneously, we\nread these web pages and convert their textual content into\ntext chunks with a maximum length of 300 tokens. Using an\nopen-source dense retriever, we select the top-30 text chunks\nthat match the query most effectively. These retrieved text\nchunks, along with the snippets provided by the search API,\nwill serve as our external documents. These documents will\nbe divided into positive documents and negative documents\nbased on whether they contain the answer.\nTestbeds construction for each ability.We expand the\ncorpus and divided it into 4 testbeds to evaluate the above\nbasic abilities of LLMs. To evaluate the noise robustness,\nwe sample varying numbers of negative documents ac-\ncording to the desired ratio of noises. For negative rejec-\ntion, all the external documents are sampled from negative\ndocuments. For the information integration ability, we fur-\nther construct data based on the above generated questions.\nThis involves expanding or rewriting these questions so that\ntheir answers encompass multiple aspects. For example, the\nquestion “Who won the MVP of Super Bowl 2023?” can\nbe rewrite as “Who won the MVPs of Super Bowl 2022\nand 2023?”. Consequently, answering such questions re-\nquires utilizing information from various documents. Dif-\nferent from the first three abilities, the data of counterfactual\nrobustness is constructed solely based on the internal knowl-\nedge of the model. Based on the aforementioned generated\nquestions mentioned above, we adopt ChatGPT to automat-\nically generate its known knowledge. Specifically, we use\nprompts to allow the model to generate both questions and\nanswers that are already known. For example, based on the\nquestion “Who was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for Phys-\niology and Medicine?”, the model will generate the known\nquestion “Who was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Lit-\nerature?” and answer “Abdulrazak Gurnah”. We then man-\nually verified the generated answers, and retrieve relevant\ndocuments as described above. In order to make documents\ncontain factual errors, we manually modify the answers and\nreplace the corresponding parts in the document.\nFinally, we collect totally 600 base questions in RGB,\nand 200 additional questions for the information integration\nability and 200 additional questions for counterfactual ro-\nbustness ability. Half of the instances are in English, and the\nother half are in Chinese.\nEvaluation Metrics\nThe core of this benchmark is to evaluate whether LLMs can\nutilize the provided external documents to acquire knowl-\nedge and generate reasonable answers. We evaluate the re-\nsponses of LLMs in order to measure above-mentioned four\nabilities of them.\nAccuracy is used to measure noise robustness and infor-\nmation integration. We employ an exact matching approach\nwhere if the generated text contains an exact match to the\nanswer, it is considered as a correct answer.\nRejection rate is used to measure negative rejection.\nWhen only noisy documents are provided, LLMs should\noutput the specific content – “I can not answer the question\nbecause of the insufficient information in documents.” (We\nuse instructions to inform the model.). If the model gener-\nates this content, it indicates a successful rejection.\nError detection ratemeasures whether the model can\ndetect the factual errors in the documents for counterfactual\nrobustness. When the provided documents contain factual\nerrors, the model should output the specific content – “There\nare factual errors in the provided documents.” (We use in-\nstructions to inform the model.). If the model generates this\ncontent, it indicates that the model has detected erroneous\ninformation in the document.\nError correction ratemeasures whether the model can\nprovide the correct answer after identifying errors for coun-\nterfactual robustness. The model is asked to generate the cor-\nrect answer after identifying the factual errors. If the model\ngenerates the correct answer, it indicates that the model is\ncapable of correcting errors in the document.\nConsidering that LLMs may not fully adhere to instruc-\ntions, for rejection rate and error detection rate, we also use\nChatGPT to conduct additional evaluation of the responses.\nSpecifically, we prompt ChatGPT to determine if the re-\nsponses can reflect information that is not present in the doc-\nument or identify any factual errors.\nExperiments\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of various\nLLMs, analyze and discuss the results, summarizing the\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n17757\nEnglish Chinese\nNoise Ratio 0 0.2\n0.4 0.6 0.8 0 0.2\n0.4 0.6 0.8\nChatGPT (OpenAI\n2022) 96.33 94.67\n94.00 90.00 76.00 95.67 94.67\n91.00 87.67 70.67\nChatGLM-6B (THUDM 2023a) 93.67 90.67\n89.33 84.67 70.67 94.33 90.67\n89.00 82.33 69.00\nChatGLM2-6B (THUDM 2023b) 91.33 89.67\n83.00 77.33 57.33 86.67 82.33\n76.67 72.33 54.00\nVicuna-7B-v1.3 (Chiang et al. 2023) 87.67 83.33\n86.00 82.33 60.33 85.67 82.67\n77.00 69.33 49.67\nQwen-7B-Chat (Bai et al. 2023) 94.33 91.67\n91.00 87.67 73.67 94.00 92.33\n88.00 84.33 68.67\nBELLE-7B-2M (BELLEGroup 2023) 83.33 81.00\n79.00 71.33 64.67 92.00 88.67\n85.33 78.33 67.68\nTable 1: The experimental result of noise robustness measured by accuracy (%) under different noise ratios.

In our experiments on noise robustness, we evalu-\nate scenarios with noise ratios ranging from 0 to 0.8.\nModels We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art LLMs includ-\ning ChatGPT (OpenAI 2022) (gpt-3.5-turbo), ChatGLM-\n6B (THUDM 2023a), ChatGLM2-6B (THUDM 2023b),\nVicuna-7b-v1.3 (Chiang et al. 2023), Qwen-7B-Chat (Bai\net al. 2023), BELLE-7B-2M (BELLEGroup 2023).\nResults on Noise Robustness\nWe evaluated the accuracy based on the different noise ratios\nin external documents, and the results are shown in Table 1.\nWe can see that:\n(1) RAG can effect improve the responses of LLMs.\nLLMs have shown strong performance even in the presence\nof noise, indicating that RAG is a promising way for LLMs\nto generate accurate and reliable responses.\n(2) The increasing noise rate poses a challenge for\nRAG in LLMs.Specifically, when the noise ratio exceeds\n80%, the accuracy decreases significantly at a significance\nlevel of 0.05. For example, the performance of ChatGPT has\ndecreased from 96.33% to 76.00%, while the performance\nof ChatGLM2-6B has decreased from 91.33% to 57.33%.\nError Analysis To better comprehend the negative impact\nof noise on model generation, we examined the incorrect an-\nswers and found that these errors typically originate from\nthree reasons, as shown in Table 2.\n(1) Long-distance information.LLMs often face diffi-\nculty in identifying the correct answer from external docu-\nments when the information related to the question is distant\nfrom the information related to the answer. This scenario\nis quite common as longer texts are frequently encountered\non the internet. In such cases, it is typical for the question’s\ninformation to be initially presented at the start of the doc-\nument and subsequently referred to using pronouns. In Ta-\nble 2, the question information (“Qatar Open 2022”) is only\nmentioned once at the beginning and is far from where the\nanswer text “Anett Kontaveit” appears. This situation may\ncause LLMs to depend on information from other docu-\nments and create false impressions, i.e., hallucination.\n(2) Evidence uncertainty. Before highly anticipated\nevents, like the release of new Apple products or the an-\nnouncement of the Oscars, there is often a significant\namount of speculative information circulating on the inter-\nnet. Although the relevant documents explicitly state that\nit is uncertain or speculative content, they can still impact\non the retrieval-augmented generation of LLMs. In Table 2,\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n17758\nLanguages English Chinese\nRej Rej∗ Rej Rej∗\nChatGPT 24.67 45.00 5.33 43.33\nChatGLM-6B 9.00 25.00 6.33 17.00\nChatGLM2-6B 10.33 41.33 6.33 36.33\nV\nicuna-7B-v1.3 17.00 33.33 3.37 24.67\nQwen-7B-Chat 31.00 35.67 8.67 25.33\nBELLE-7B-2M 5.67 32.33 5.33 13.67\nTable 3: The result of negative rejection. Rej means the re-\njection rate (%) and Rej∗ means the rejection rate evaluated\nby ChatGPT. We can see that negative rejection poses a chal-\nlenge for RAG in LLMs.\nwhen the noise ratio increases, the content of erroneous\ndocuments is all about some people’s predictions about the\nname of the headset (“Apple Reality Pro”). Even if there is\na correct answer (“Vision Pro”) in the relevant documents,\nLLMs can still be misled by uncertain evidences.\n(3) Concept confusion.The concepts in external docu-\nments may be similar to, but different from, the concepts in\nthe question. This can cause confusion for LLMs and make\nLLMs generate incorrect answers. In Table 2, the model an-\nswer focuses on the concept “automotive revenue” in the\ndocument rather than “revenue” in the question.\nBased on the analysis above, we have identified certain\nlimitations in LLMs regarding retrieval-augmented genera-\ntion. To effectively handle the vast amount of noise present\non the internet, further detailed enhancements are required\nfor the model such as long documents modeling and precise\nconcept comprehension.\nResults on Negative Rejection Testbed\nWe evaluated the rejection rate when only noise documents\nwere provided. The results are shown in Table 3. In addi-\ntion to evaluating the rejection rate through exact matching\n(Rej in Table 3), we also utilize ChatGPT to determine if\nthe responses from the LLMs contain any rejection informa-\ntion (Rej∗ in Table 3). We can see that: Negative Rejection\nposes a challenge for RAG in LLMs.The highest rejection\nrates for LLMs in English and Chinese were only 45% and\n43.33%, respectively. This suggests that LLMs can be easily\nmisled by noisy documents, leading to incorrect answers.\nIn addition, through comparing Rej and Rej ∗, we found\nthat LLMs fail to strictly follow instructions, and they often\ngenerate unpredictable responses, which make it hard to use\nthem as state triggers (such as for recognizing rejection).\nWe conduct case studies in Table 4. The first error is\nbecause of Evidence uncertainty. Although the document\nonly mentions contact with “Adam McKay” and does not\nexplicitly state that he is the director of the movie, the\nmodel still concludes that he holds this role. The first er-\nror is because of Concept confusion. The information pro-\nvided in the answer pertains to “the 2018 Winter Olympics”\ninstead of “the 2022 Olympics” mentioned in the question.\nRetrieval-augmented generation poses a greater challenge of\nQuestion Answer Response\nwho will\ndirect\nIrredeemable film?\nJeymes\nSamuel\n...

In future developments, it\nwill be crucial for LLMs to enhance their ability to accu-\nrately match questions with the appropriate documents.\nResults on Information Integration Testbed\nWe evaluated the accuracy based on the different noise ratios\nin external documents, and the results are shown in Table 5.\nWhen comparing the model to Table 1, we observed that\nit has a weak information integration ability, which in turn\naffects its noise robustness. We can see that:\n(1) Information integration poses a challenge for RAG\nin LLMs.Even without noise, the highest accuracy of LLMs\ncan only reach 60% and 67% for English and Chinese,\nrespectively. After adding noise, the highest accuracy de-\ncreases to 43% and 55%. These results suggest that LLMs\nstruggle with integrating information effectively and are not\nwell-suited for directly answering complex questions.\n(2) Complex questions are more challenging for RAG\nwith noisy documents.Performance decline becomes sig-\nnificant when the noise ratio is 0.4, but for simple problems,\na significant decline occurs only at a noise ratio of 0.8 at a\nsignificance level of 0.05. This indicates that complex prob-\nlems are more vulnerable to interference from noise. We\nspeculate that this is because solving complex problems re-\nquires integrating information from multiple documents, and\nthis information can be considered as noise to each other,\nmaking it harder for the model to extract relevant informa-\ntion from the documents.\nError Analysis We conducted an error analysis on\nChatGLM2-6B (noise ratio is 0). Apart from the similar er-\nrors founded in the noise robustness experiment (38% of the\ntotal), there are also three types of unique errors. We have\npresented these cases in Table 6.\n(1) Merging Error (28% of the total).The model some-\ntimes merges the answers of the two sub-questions, resulting\nin an error. It mistakenly uses the answer from one question\nto address both two questions. At this point, the model will\ndisregard any documents related to one sub-question. For\nexample, in Table 6, it incorrectly states that Group D is the\nWorld Cup group for both France and Germany, while in fact\nGermany is actually assigned to Group E.\n(2) Ignoring Error (28% of the total).Sometimes, the\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n17759\nEnglish Chinese\nNoise Ratio 0 0.2\n0.4 0 0.2\n0.4\nChatGPT 55 51\n34 63 58 47\nChatGLM-6B 45 36\n35 60 53\n52\nChatGLM2-6B 34 32\n21 44 43\n32\nVicuna-7B-v1.3 60 53\n43 43 36\n25\nQwen-7B-Chat 55 50\n37 67 56 55\nBELLE-7B-2M 40 34\n24 49 41\n38\nTable 5: The experimental result of information integration\nmeasured by accuracy (%) under different noise ratios.\nQuestion Answer Response Errors\nWhat groupings\nare\nFrance and\nGermany in Wo-\nrld Cup 2022?\nGroup\nD\nGroup E\nFrance and\nGerman\ny are\nGroup D...\nMerging\nErr\nor\nWho were\nthe\nMVP of Super\nBowl 2022 and\n2023?\nCooper\nKupp\nP\natrick\nMahomes\nMVP of\nSuper\nBowl LVI was\nCooper Kupp\nIgnoring\nError\nWhat films\nwon\nthe 2022 and\n2023 Academy\nAwards for Best\nPicture?\nCODA\nEverything\nEverywher\ne\nAll at Once\nCODA w\non\naward for\nBest Picture\nat the 95th ...\nMisali\ngnment\nError\nTable 6: Error cases of information integration, the re-\nsponses are generated by ChatGLM2-6B. The bold and ital-\nicized texts represent the answers to two sub-questions.\nmodel may ignore one of the sub-questions and only answer\nthe other. This error occurs when the model lacks a complete\nunderstanding of the problem and fails to recognize that it\nconsists of multiple sub-problems. As a result, the model\nonly considers relevant documents for one sub-problem in\norder to generate an answer, disregarding the question posed\nby another sub-problem. For example, in Table 6, the model\nonly provides the answer for the MVP of Super Bowl 2022\nand does not consider 2023.\n(3) Misalignment Error (6% of the total).Sometimes,\nthe model incorrectly identifies the documents for one sub-\nquestion as the documents for another sub-question, leading\nto misaligned answers. For example, in Table 6, the third an-\nswer has two errors: an ignoring error and a misalignment er-\nror. Firstly, the model only mentioned the Best Picture of the\n2023 (95th) Academy Awards, completely disregarding the\n2022 awards. Additionally, it incorrectly stated that “CODA”\nis the Best Picture of 2023 when it was actually awarded as\nthe Best Picture in 2022.\nThe errors mentioned above are primarily caused by the\nlimited understanding of complex questions, which hinders\nthe ability to effectively utilize information from different\nsub-problems. The key lies in improving the model’s rea-\nsoning capability. One possible solution is to use a chain-of-\nthought approach to break down complex problems (Zhou\net al. 2023a; Xu et al. 2023b; Drozdov et al. 2023).

CR is the error cor-\nrection rate.\never, these methods slow down the inference speed and can-\nnot provide timely responses.\nResults on Counterfactual Robustness Testbed\nIn order to ensure that LLMs possess relevant knowledge,\nwe assess their performance by directly asking them ques-\ntions. However, we found that most LLMs struggle to an-\nswer them correctly. To ensure a more reasonable evalua-\ntion, we only consider LLMs that have an accuracy rate of\nover 70% as this threshold is relatively high and encom-\npasses more LLMs. The results are shown in Table 7. We\npresent the following metrics: accuracy without any docu-\nments, accuracy with counterfactual documents, error de-\ntection rates, and error correction rates. We can see that It\nis hard for LLMs to identify and correct factual errors in the\ndocuments. This suggests that the model can be easily mis-\nled by documents containing incorrect facts.\nIt is important to note that retrieval-augmented generation\nis not designed to automatically address factual errors within\na given context, as this contradicts the underlying assump-\ntion that the model lacks knowledge and relies on retrieved\ndocuments for additional information. However, this issue is\ncrucial in practical applications due to the abundance of fake\nnews on the internet. Existing LLMs do not have a safeguard\nto handle inaccurate responses caused by misinformation. In\nfact, they heavily depend on the information they retrieve.\nEven when LLMs contain the internal knowledge about the\nquestions, they often trust false information that is retrieved.\nThis presents significant a challenge for the future develop-\nment of RAG in LLMs.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we evaluated four abilities of retrieval-\naugmented generation in LLMs: noise robustness, nega-\ntive rejection, information integration, and counterfactual\nrobustness. To conduct the evaluation, we built Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation Benchmark (RGB). The instances of\nRGB are generated from latest news articles and the external\ndocuments obtained from search engines. The experimental\nresults suggest that current LLMs have limitations in the 4\nabilities. This indicates that there is still a significant amount\nof work needed to effectively apply RAG to LLMs. To en-\nsure accurate and reliable responses from LLMs, it is crucial\nto exercise caution and carefully design for RAG.\nThe Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AAAI-24)\n17760\nAcknowledgements\nThis research work is supported by the National Natural\nScience Foundation of China under Grants no. 62122077,\n62106251, 62306303, the CAS Project for Young Scien-\ntists in Basic Research under Grant No.YSBR-040 and\nBeijing Municipal Science & Technology Comission No.\nZ231100010323002.
