INTRODUCTION\nThe existence of gauge/gravity dualities [1–3] is remarkable and with each passing day we\ndiscover a new piece to their puzzle. Part of why these theories are so mysterious is because\nthey often have non-intuitive and surprising properties that seem to lead to paradoxes. One\nof these was recently resolved by Almheiri, Dong, and Harlow [4]. The puzzle they addressed\nwas that a local ﬁeld at a point in the bulk should have vanishing commutators with ﬁelds\nthat are spatially separated from them, including the boundary. A point in the center of\nglobal AdS would be spatially separated from the boundary at t = 0 (they belong to the\nsame Cauchy slice) and would therefore have to commute with all local operator insertions\non the boundary. Such a ﬁeld should act trivially on the Hilbert space of states, and yet,\nbe encoded as a non-trivial operator on the boundary. That is, bulk information seemed to\nbe non-localized in the boundary theory in an unexpected way. Their resolution was that\nthough this might seem strange, it is not an entirely new phenomenon and in fact has a very\nnice interpretation in terms of quantum information theory. The idea is that the holographic\ncorrespondence acts as a quantum error correcting code. The commutation properties that\nare required are true in a subspace of the Hilbert space called the code subspace. It is this\nrestriction to the code subspace that makes it possible to have the vanishing commutators\nin an eﬀective sense, rather than as a statement on the full Hilbert space of states, where\nsuch properties are forbidden by quantum ﬁeld theory theorems. Since their original work,\nthere has been much progress in reinterpreting gauge/gravity dualities as holographic codes\n(for instance [5–7]). In this paper, we will push the idea further. We ﬁnd that the language\nof code subspaces is a natural home for eﬀective ﬁeld theory and further, this can be seen\nexplicitly within the framework of the LLM geometries [8].\nIn standard quantum information theory, if one wants to encode a message, one utilizes\na Hilbert space of states larger than is necessary. One then constrains allowed messages\nto a particular subspace, the code subspace. For instance, one might use a few qubits to\nsend a one qubit message, this provides a larger Hilbert space to work with and allows the\nmessenger to choose whatever subspace they like to work within. In [4], the authors deﬁned\na set of code subspaces in AdS/CFT to be those formed as the linear span of\n|Ω⟩, φi(x)|Ω⟩, φi(xi)φj(x2)|Ω⟩,... (1)\n3\nwhere the φi(x) make up some ﬁnite set of local bulk operators, which can be realized\nin the CFT with the Hamilton-Kabat-Lifschitz-Lowe reconstruction of bulk operators [9].\nAlmheiry et al. take |Ω⟩to be the ground state of the system (though they say one could also\nconsider other semiclassical background states, as we will do explicitly). The quantum error\ncorrecting properties of the gauge/gravity duality code make it possible to have a realization\nof the ﬁelds φ in the code subspace that commute with operators on the boundary, as long\nas one restricts the evaluation to states that belong to the code subspace.\nIn this work, we start by discussing eﬀective ﬁeld theory around a given classical back-\nground. We consider the Hilbert space accessible to an experimenter, which can be built by\nacting on the background state with some set of eﬀective ﬁelds, in a way similar to equation\n(1). That is, we want to take a construction similar to the code subspace of vacuum AdS\nwithin the conﬁnes of eﬀective ﬁeld theory and show that this has a lot of desirable properties\nfor addressing more general questions of quantum gravity. Because an experimenter will not\nhave access to inﬁnite energy, they cannot act with all ﬁelds in the theory, but rather they\nare constrained by some cutoﬀ (both in momentum and occupation number). It will turn\nout that the details of what cutoﬀ is appropriate for each background will depend on the\nparticular background under consideration. That is, the formulation of eﬀective ﬁeld theory\nis state dependent in relation to the reference state that we choose to expand from. We\nobserve that the space built in this way exactly matches the structure of the code subspace\ndeﬁned in [4] and we expand on this fact. This is also very similar to how the Hilbert space\nof nearby states is built around black hole states in the work of Papadodimas and Raju\n[10, 11], by starting with a reference state. We discuss this philosophy in section II.\nIn the rest of the paper, we deal speciﬁcally with the example of the LLM Geometries,\nwhich are dual to the half-BPS states of N= 4 SYM. This is a very useful setup to work\nwith as it is a place where we understand both the geometric description [8] and the ﬁeld\ntheory Hilbert space well [12, 13]. In fact, most of the exact computations turn out to be\ncombinatorial in nature [14] (see also [15]). In section III, we build some necessary technology\nto do computations. The basic input is that there are two convenient bases for describing\nthe set of half-BPS states: one that can be classiﬁed by Young diagrams and one built by\ntaking traces of powers of a matrix Z. In this section, we provide the details of these two\nbases, describing how to go between them and computing their inner products. These will\nbe the tools we need for the remainder of the work, and generalize some constructions that\n4\nwere carried out in our previous work [14] for ﬁnite N.\nThese states are dual to the set of half-BPS states in type IIB supergravity: the LLM\ngeometries. Each geometry in this set can be classiﬁed by a black and white coloring of\nthe plane. We consider the set of concentric ring conﬁgurations, because they are dual to\nstates that are simple to describe in terms of Young diagrams [8, 16]. Although in principle\nother such geometries could be analyzed, the control of the states in the ﬁeld theory dual is\npoor and relies on approximations. With the concentric conﬁgurations, we can make exact\nstatements in the Hilbert space of states. These states dual to concentric rings will be the\nbackground states upon which we build our code subspaces. The nearby states that make\nup the subspace are built by acting with eﬀective gravity ﬁeld perturbations on each edge\nof the rings, which causes them to deform. With a bit of work, we are able to write down\nthese ﬁelds explicitly so that we can build the states as in (1) in a way that is suitable for\nour purposes. This is the content of section IV.\nBy only considering the geometric description, the aforementioned cutoﬀs are not im-\nmediately clear and although in principle one should be able to derive them, it takes a\nconsiderable amount of eﬀort. So, instead, in section V, we go back to the representation\nof the states in terms of Young diagrams, where things become clearer. The well behaved\nconcentric ring conﬁgurations correspond to diagrams with few corners. The eﬀective ﬁelds\nare build out of modes that act only in a particular corner of the diagram and one can\nreproduce directly the supergravity analysis entirely with combinatorial techniques. These\ntechniques have been developed in various papers for diﬀerent settings (see [14, 15, 17–19]\nand references therein).\nIn section VI, we undertake the problem of understanding the cutoﬀ. The cutoﬀ is\nprovided by constraining the excitations so that they do not simultaneously aﬀect multiple\ncorners of the diagram and by requiring that they are suﬃciently planar. This corresponds\nto each ﬁeld only acting on a single edge of the concentric rings and having small energy,\nalthough the energy of an individual quantum can be much larger than the Planck scale 1.\nWe can write these excitations in terms of modes that act in a particular corner of the Young\ndiagram and from these build a Fock space representation.\nIn section VII we expand on some of our previous work [14, 20], where we compute\nthe topology of the states within a given code subspace. Previously, we were in the strict\n1 The energy of an individual quantum can scale like N1/2, rather than N1/4\n5\nN →∞ limit, but here we go beyond that, taking N to be large, but ﬁnite. As before,\nwe ﬁnd that we can extract the topological information from entanglement and uncertainty\ncalculations, though it requires more work: a number can not be guessed any longer form a\nsingle mode, but it requires many modes instead. Here we also ﬁnd a close connection with\nthe recent work of Balasubramanian, et. al. [21], who showed the existence of entanglement\nshadows in the LLM geometries. We ﬁnd that similarly, the extrapolate dictionary seems\nto stop at the outermost anti-edge of the concentric ring diagrams. This is the second edge\nstarting from the outside going inward in the radial direction of the LLM plane and it is the\nsame place where the entanglement shadow begins.\nFinally, in section VIII we consider the overlap that can occur between diﬀerent code\nsubspaces. We look speciﬁcally at an example where you start with two diﬀerent background\nstates and add particular excitations to each, which results in having prepared two identical\nstates from the viewpoint of Young diagrams, but whose construction indicates that they\nshould be assigned diﬀerent metric operators. We discuss the ambiguities that arise because\nof this fact, which in particular obscures one’s ability to write down a globally well deﬁned\nmetric operator.\nII. CODE SUBSPACES AND EFFECTIVE FIELD THEORY\nIn this section, we will discuss doing eﬀective ﬁeld theory around some classical back-\nground. We will consider the constraints put on an experimenter in this set-up and will\nshow how what we end up with matches previous deﬁnitions of code subspaces.\nLet us start by assuming we are given a quantum state |B⟩that is dual to a classical\nbackground for a ﬁeld or gravitational theory. Eventually we will work in a ﬁeld theory with\na gravitational dual, using the gauge/gravity duality. Here, the state |B⟩will correspond\nto a classical background in the bulk, rather than the boundary theory. Though |B⟩is a\nclassical background, we need to be careful, because in the quantum theory the quantum\nﬂuctuations can never be zero. Instead, we should think of |B⟩as a coherent state, where\n(eﬀective) quantum ﬁelds have minimal uncertainty relative to the background. We also\nwant to be careful because we will often have a cutoﬀ to account for. For instance, if |B⟩is\na ground state for a gapped system, |0⟩, the cutoﬀ might be in the energy available to us.\nThis will restrict us in two diﬀerent ways. First, it will require that the only modes that\n6\ncan be excited are long wavelength ﬂuctuations (of small enough energy) and further, we\nwill be restricted in the occupation number of any one such mode, so that the energy cutoﬀ\nalso imposes an amplitude cutoﬀ for any one mode. Generally, this could be conﬁguration\ndependent if for example, the gap for some additional excitation depends on a vacuum\nexpectation value. This is common in supersymmetric ﬁeld theories when we have a moduli\nspace of vacua.\nIn analyzing this system, we might want to understand what a Hilbert space of nearby\nstates to the background |B⟩would look like. The state |B⟩belongs to a Hilbert space\nof states Hthat deﬁnes the full quantum theory. It is tempting to consider the set of\nstates |ψ⟩∈H such that they diﬀer from |B⟩by a small amount, ϵ inside the Hilbert space\n||ψ⟩−| B⟩|< ϵ. There are many problems with this prescription, and we will enumerate\na few of them in what follows. First, the set of states |ψ⟩is not a linear subspace of H:\nwe cannot do quantum mechanics restricted to the nearby states. Secondly, the set of such\nstates |ψ⟩makes no mention of the cutoﬀ nor to the eﬀective ﬁelds.\nWe want to deﬁne the set of nearby states to be those that can be generated from |B⟩by\nthe action of the eﬀective ﬁelds, and so that it is also a linear space. That is, we want the set\nof nearby states to be a Hilbert space in its own right: a Hilbert space where an experimenter\ncan act and make observations, and in principle make predictions for those observations as\nwell, within the constraints that would be imposed by the apparatus and how it acts in\neﬀective ﬁeld theory. Such sub-Hilbert spaces can be thought of as code subspaces: the set of\nobservables of the experimenter is constrained to lie in the code subspace. At the technical\nlevel, the idea will be to ﬁrst decompose the ﬁelds φi(x) = ⟨φi(x)⟩B + ∑\nλfi,λ(x)a†\ni,λ +\n∑\nλf∗\ni,λ(x)bλ,i into raising/lowering operators of approximate wavelength λ. We need to\ninclude the b modes to allow for the possibility that the ﬁeld φi is complex, otherwise we\nhave b ≃a†. For brevity, we will take the ﬁeld to be real. We also need to require that\nthe a,a† approximately satisfy the Weyl commutation relations. To impose a cutoﬀ, we\nstate that the set of λ is restricted. We also impose that |B⟩is annihilated by the lowering\noperators a. This second condition is what deﬁnes the state operationally to be eﬀectively\na coherent state.\nWe make use of the modes of the ﬁelds φi(x) acting on |B⟩to generate new states\n|(i1,λ1),... (ik,λk); B⟩=\n∏\nj\na†\nij,λj |B⟩ (2)\n7\nfor some such collection of pairs ( ij,λj). We can think of this state as the background state\n|B⟩with some ﬁnite number of cutoﬀ respecting excitations turned on. We will call our\ncutoﬀ Λ. Usually, we interpret Λ as a UV cutoﬀ in eﬀective ﬁeld theory around a ground\nstate, so that energies (frequencies) ωof individual excitations are bounded above by ω≤Λ.\nHere, we are constrained so that our set of excitations collectively stay below Λ. The cutoﬀ\nΛ should not be in general thought of as simply a ﬁxed shortest wavelength, nor as just\nan upper bound on the energy. It can also be position dependent and dependent on the\ndiﬀerent modes. In the work [4], the cutoﬀ is implicit in the sense that we do not form a\nblack hole. In the work of Papadodimas and Raju, the cutoﬀ is described by not having too\nmany actions on the reference state [11]. This is again an implicit cutoﬀ.\nWe will call the Hilbert space\nHB,Λ = Span(|(i1,λ1),...(ik,λk); B⟩|{(i1,λ1),...(ik,λk)}≤ Λ) (3)\nthe code subspace associated with the background |B⟩and the cutoﬀ Λ. This will be\nsometimes abbreviated to Hcode. This is in accordance with the deﬁnition of code subspace\nfound in the work of Almheiry, Dong, Harlow [4] on quantum error correction and it also\nmatches the eﬀective description of states generated from a reference black hole state in the\nwork of Papadodimas and Raju [11, 22]. This also matches the deﬁnition of the nearby\nHilbert space of states in our previous work [14]. The advantage of using the language of\ncode subspaces is that it makes three items automatic. First, it is a Hilbert space, so that we\ncan do quantum mechanics inside Hcode. Secondly, eﬀective ﬁelds act simply on it. Finally,\nthere is an explicit cutoﬀ Λ, so this does not need to be repeated again and again: it is part\nof the deﬁnition of the code subspace itself.\nIf the state |B⟩is an excited state (not a ground state), one can in principle ﬁnd many\nstates that have a similar energy to |B⟩but that are not generated in this way. One should\nthink of the code subspace HB,Λ as the set of states that is accessible to an experimenter\nwho can control the excitations of the ﬁelds φi below the cutoﬀ. In this sense, this is the\nnatural home for eﬀective ﬁeld theory. As an experimenter builds a better experiment,\nthe cutoﬀ might change and more states can become available. However, the eﬀective ﬁeld\ntheory description might break down. This is not a failure of quantum mechanics, but of\nthe simpliﬁed description of the Hilbert space of available states that the experimenter can\naccess.\n8\nWith this deﬁnition, the ﬁelds φi have been given to us, at the very least in an implicit\nform, as well as the mode expansion. In general, we could expect that there are non-linear\nﬁeld redeﬁnitions to worry about, as they might generate states that do not belong to the\ncode subspace. We also have to worry that under time evolution the states might exit the\ncode subspace. As long as we can stay comfortably inside Hcode for some ﬁxed amount of\ntime we will be content. To do so we will also include a temporal cutoﬀ in the time during\nwhich experiments can be performed. The second problem is not obviously an immediate\nissue if |B⟩is an energy eigenstate, but the problem will kick in as soon as we act on the\nstate. We do not address these issues directly for general setups, rather, we will leave these\nissues implicit in the deﬁnition of Λ itself, thinking of it as a set of all the necessary cutoﬀ\ninformation.\nOne might think that this is overly pedantic. The purpose of this paper is to show that this\nstructure is the only sense in which one can do eﬀective ﬁeld theory in a particular subsector\nof a gravitational theory. It will turn out that diﬀerent code subspaces will generically\nbe incompatible. That is, assume that a state belongs to two such code subspaces |ψ⟩∈\nHB,Λ,HB′,Λ′. The topology of |B⟩, |B′⟩and the number of (eﬀective) ﬁelds might diﬀer\nsubstantially to the point where even though the state |ψ⟩is well deﬁned, we cannot say\nwhat topology it has (the one of |B⟩or |B′⟩) nor the number of ﬁelds. More importantly, one\ncode subspace might recycle a ﬁeld of another code subspace nonlinearly into many ﬁelds.\nWhat this will mean is that the physical answer to many (interpretational) questions can\nonly be answered inside the diﬀerent code subspaces, but not in the full Hilbert space H.\nOur goal in the rest of the paper will be to explain how to construct a particular collection\nof code subspaces explicitly, including the eﬀective ﬁelds and the cutoﬀ and to show precisely\nhow they are incompatible.\nIII. THE ACTION OF TRACES ON YOUNG TABLEAUX\nWe will now consider a particular set-up, where we can study eﬀective ﬁeld theory ex-\nplicitly. The half-BPS states of N= 4 SYM on the sphere are in one to one correspondence\nwith the gauge invariant local operators that are build out of polynomials of a single scalar\nﬁeld Z(x) (which we will take to be in the adjoint in the adjoint of U(N)). This space\nis converted into a Hilbert space via the operator state correspondence that is available in\n9\nconformal ﬁeld theories. We write the map as follows O→|O⟩ . For us to understand the\nHilbert space of states, we need to determine the norms of states. The norms of states that\ncorrespond to local operators come the Zamolodchikov norm of the operator, obtained from\nthe two point function as follows\n⟨O†(x)O(0)⟩= ⟨O|O⟩\n|x|2∆O\n(4)\nWhat we need now is the complete list of operators in a basis that is suitable for computa-\ntions. This problem was solved in [12], where it was noted that a Schur polynomial basis\nwas orthogonal (this is based on the fact that characters of Z in irreducible representations\nof U(N) are orthogonal). However, there is another basis made of string states, which are\ntraces , that is also useful and can be used to deﬁne the supergravity ﬁelds of AdS5 ×S5. It\nis the traces that are used to deﬁne the extrapolate dictionary of AdS/CFT [2]. Thus, it is\nnecessary to study both basis to get to the complete physical description.\nThere are two natural ways to construct gauge invariant operators from a matrix Z. One\nof them is to take traces of powers ofZ, Tr(Zm) and to consider the set of linear combinations\nof multi-traces of Z. The other is to think of an N×N matrix Z as an element of GL(N,C).\nThen we can take the character of Z in some representation of the group GL(N,C), R, and\ndenote the result as χR(Z). The latter are classiﬁed by Young diagrams.\nThese two bases of gauge invariant operators generate the same linear space and can\nbe related to each other algebraically. For example, the fundamental representation, with\nYoung Tableau □, can be related to Tr( Z) via its character as\nχ□(Z) = Tr(Z). (5)\nTo write the relationship for other states, we need a few more deﬁnitions. Let [ σ] be\na conjugacy class of Sn. The conjugacy class of [ σ] is in one to one correspondence with\ngroup elements σ of the same cycle decomposition, where there are nj([σ]) cycles of length\nj, so that n = ∑\nj jnj([σ]). See appendix A for details on how the cycle decomposition is\nobtained from a group element. To each such cycle, we associate the trace Tr( Zj), so that\nto the element [σ] we can associate the monomial in the traces\n[σ] →\n∏\nj\n(Tr(Zj))nj([σ]). (6)\n10\nIf R is represented by a Young diagram with n boxes, which we indicate by Rn, then\nχRn (Z) = 1\nn!\n∑\n[σ]∈Conj[Sn]\nχR([σ])dσ\n∏\ni\n(Tr(Zi))ni([σ]) (7)\nwhere dσ is the number of elements of the conjugacy class, χR([σ]) is the character of σ in\nthe representation of the group Sn with the same Young diagram as Rn (these are in one\nto one correspondence via Schur-Weyl duality). This explains how to write the basis χR(Z)\nin terms of traces. The map is invertible (the fact that the relationship between conjugacy\nclasses and representations is invertible is true for any ﬁnite group, see [23]). The result of\nthis inversion is\n(Tr(Zi))ni([σ]) =\n∑\n[R]∈Reps[Sn]\nχR([σ−1])χR(Z) (8)\nIn what follows, we will deﬁne the variables tℓ = Tr(Zℓ), and we will label the represen-\ntations of R directly in terms of Young diagrams. The length of the cycle ℓ will be called\nthe degree of tℓ, and the number of boxes of a Young diagram n will be the degree of the\nYoung diagram. With this convention we have that [ σ] →∏\nitni([σ])\ni . The sum ∑\nℓnℓℓ= n,\nso we have that the degree of each of the monomials is equal to the degree of the Young\ndiagram, and acting with an extra trace Tr( Zℓ) will be multiplication by tℓ. Acting with tℓ\non χR(Z) (by multiplication), will have degree deg( R) +ℓand can be expressed in terms of\nthe basis of the χ˜R, with deg( ˜R) = deg(R) + ℓ.\nFor example, we can take the state\n(6,4,2,1) = (9)\nwhere we label R= (6,4,2,1) by the length of the rows of the Young diagram and we think\nof the Young diagram as the gauge invariant operator χR(Z) itself. Now, we want to act\nwith one of the tℓ, and see what linear combination of representation characters we get. The\nanswer is actually simple.\nWe will do the particular example oft4(6,4,2,1). Acting with t4 will give us the following\n11\nresult\nt4 = • • • •− •\n• • • (10)\n− •\n• • •\n−\n• •\n• •\n+\n•\n•\n• •\n(11)\n−\n•\n•\n•\n•\n(12)\nwhere we have indicated with circles the extra boxes that are attached to the original Young\ndiagram R. The action on any given Young diagram is given by applying the following rules:\n1. The original Young diagram sits inside the added boxes.\n2. The set of new extra boxes are arranged in a pattern where they all touch each other\nand give rise to a proper diagram when combined with the original.\n3. The set of new boxes snake around the edge of the old diagram (this means that no\nsquare pattern set of 2 ×2 boxes can be found in the new boxes). Sets of boxes with\nthis property are called skew-hooks.\n4. The coeﬃcients are all ±1. The sign is determined by how many rows the new boxes\ncover: +1 if the new boxes sit in an odd number of rows, and ( −1) if it is even.\n5. The sum is over all possible ways of attaching a skew hook of the right length (in this\ncase four, as we acted with t4) to the original Young diagram.\nWe can write these conditions as follows\ntℓ χY(Z) =\n∑\nh∈Skew hooks of length ℓ\n(−1)H(h)−1χY+h(Z) (13)\nwhere the symbol H(h) indicates the height of the hook (the number of rows it subtends).\nAlso, the length of a skew hook, |h|, is the number of boxes it has.\n12\nAs we have argued, the space of gauge invariant operators is endowed with a metric, the\nZamolodchikov metric. This is a positive deﬁnite metric and is identiﬁed with the Hilbert\nspace norm in the quantum theory on the cylinder. The norm for each Young diagram state\n|Y⟩can be evaluated as follows. We ﬁrst label the boxes of the diagram, adding one as we\ngo to the right and subtracting one as we go down\n(6,4,2,1) = +0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5\n−1 0 +1 +2\n−2 −1\n−3\n(14)\nThat is, to each box in position ( i,j) (the label i refers to the column, and the label j\nrefers to the row of the box) we associate the number i−j. The norm is then computed as\nfollows\n⟨Y|Y⟩= α#boxes\n∏\n(i,j)∈boxes\n(N + i−j) (15)\nwhere α is a normalization constant for the matrix ﬁeld Z. Also, diﬀerent Young tableaux\nare orthogonal. This was deduced in [12]. To simplify matters, we choose α = N−1. Then\nwe have that\n⟨Y|Y⟩=\n∏\n(i,j)∈boxes\n(\n1 + i−j\nN\n)\n(16)\nso that the large N →∞ limit is simple and all the norms for each Young tableaux state\nare equal to one.\nNow, since the Young diagram states are orthogonal, we can consider a dual basis for the\nYoung diagrams |ˇY′⟩, so that we have the relation\n⟨ˇY′|Y⟩= δY,Y′ (17)\nand it is easy to see that\n|ˇY⟩= |Y⟩/⟨Y|Y⟩ (18)\nUsing this dual basis, we can write the action (13) as follows\n⟨ˇY + h|tn|Y⟩= (−1)H(h)δ|h|,n (19)\n13\nwhere again, |h|is the number of boxes in the skew hook hand |Y + h⟩refers to a state |Y⟩\nwith an added hook h. If we choose the basis to be orthonormal, we ﬁnd that\n⟨ˇY + h|tn|Y⟩=\n√\n⟨Y|Y⟩√\n⟨Y + h|Y + h⟩\n⟨ˆY + h|tn|ˆY⟩ (20)\nwhere we are using |ˆY⟩to represent an orthonormal state (as opposed to the state in the\ndual basis, which has a down check instead of a hat). So the action in the orthonormal basis\nis represented by\n⟨ˆY + h|tn|ˆY⟩= (−1)H(h)δ|h|,n\n√\n⟨Y + h|Y + h⟩√\n⟨Y|Y⟩\n= (−1)H(h)δ|h|,n\n∏\n(i,j)∈boxes of h\n√(\n1 + i−j\nN\n)\n(21)\nAnd the adjoint action is\n⟨ˆY −h|t†\nn|ˆY⟩= (−1)H(h)δ|h|,n\n√\n⟨Y|Y⟩√\n⟨Y −h|Y −h⟩\n= (−1)H(h)δ|h|,n\n∏\n(i,j)∈boxes of h\n√(\n1 + i−j\nN\n)\n(22)\nWith this formula, we now have the main computational tool we need for the rest of the\npaper. It should be noted that if we take the limit where i,j are ﬁnite and N →∞, the set\nof Young tableaux states all have trivial norm and the coeﬃcients for the action of the traces\nare all ±1. In this case, the half BPS states are described exactly by a c = 1 left-moving\nchiral boson in 1 + 1 dimensions.\nIV. DEFINING THE CODE SUBSPACES FOR CONCENTRIC\nCONFIGURATIONS.\nLet us consider a particular case of an LLM geometry that is time independent and that is\ntherefore an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian of theN= 4 SYM theory on theS3×R boundary.\nThe LLM geometries are described by droplet conﬁgurations on the plane, and as they are\ntime evolved they rotate uniformly about an origin in the LLM plane. The ground state is\ndescribed by a disk, and the rotation center is located exactly at the center of the disk. For\nanother conﬁguration to be similarly time independent, the droplet conﬁguration must be\ninvariant under rotations around such an origin. This results in a droplet conﬁguration that\nis described by a set of concentric rings. Because the conﬁgurations are time independent,\nthey have an extra isometry symmetry in the supergravity description. This extra symmetry\n14\nis exactly the rotation of the conﬁguration around the origin. This is a diﬀeomorphism that\ndoes not vanish at inﬁnity and is realized as a proper symmetry of the conﬁguration. This\nis the symmetry associated with either time translation or to being an eigenstate of the\nR-charge.\nA particular example of a geometry is visualized in ﬁgure 1. The radii of the boundaries\nare labeled as follows r1 > ˜r1 > r2 > ˜r2 > ..., from the outermost boundary inwards. We\nwill call these edges and anti-edges, depending on if they are labeled with an ri or a ˜ri, that\nis, if they go from black to white (edges) or if they go from white to black (anti-edges) when\ntracing a straight line from the origin. This is in accordance with the convention established\nin [14]. The important geometric parameters are the radii r1,˜r1,... which are necessary to\n1\n1\n2\n2\nr\nr\nr r\n~ ~\nFIG. 1. A circularly invariant LLM geometry. The radii are labeled by r,˜r, depending on if they\ngo from black region to white region, or viceversa, starting from the outside and going inwards.\nuniquely identify the geometry. We will assume that we are working at ﬁxed large N, and\nthat the disk representing the ground state has been normalized to have radius equal to one.\nWe will also assume that the ri,˜ri are of order one. The area of the black region is given by\nA= π\n∑\ni\n(r2\ni −˜r2\ni) = π (23)\nwhich is the same as the area of the unit disk. This gives us one relation between the radii.\nThe energy of the state (geometry) is given by\nE ∝N2\n(∑\ni\nr4\ni −˜r4\ni\n)\n−N2 (24)\n15\nAs long as the radii are moderately spaced, the solution is weakly curved and eﬀective\nﬁeld theory is valid. Small deformations of the geometry that preserve the supersymmetry\ncan be characterized by having the ri,˜ri vary with the angle around the origin as follows\nri(θ) = ri + δri(θ), ˜ri(θ) = ˜ri + δ˜ri(θ) with δr,δ˜r <<1 and more precisely, we require that\nthe conﬁguration is fairly smooth so that the wiggles are not too pronounced. This is what\nwe mean by long wavelength ﬂuctuations. This is depicted in ﬁgure 2. Larger deformations\n1\n1\n2\n2\nr\nr\nr r\n~ ~\nθ\nFIG. 2. A slightly deformed circularly invariant LLM geometry. The radii are now given by\nri(θ),˜ri(θ)\nwill have either short wavelength (rougher edges), or larger amplitude resulting in more\npronounced creases.\nFrom the point of view of supergravity, it is obvious that to each of the radii ri,˜ri we can\nassociate a function of one variable θthat preserves the supersymmetry of the conﬁguration\nand that therefore the eﬀective ﬁeld theory – restricted to the half-BPS states– is now\ndescribed by many functions ofθ. Since each ri,˜ri can be in principle deformed independently\nof the others, we have to associate an eﬀective ﬁeld with each such (anti-) edge. Each such\nﬁeld should result in a left chiral ﬁeld φi(θ),˜φi(θ), just like the single edge of the ground\nstate results in such a ﬁeld.\nIn the limit where the δri,˜δri <<1, we can expand the area of the regions to linear order\nin these deformations. We get that the areas of the regions are given by one of the two\n16\nexpressions (the left for black regions and the right for white)\nAi = 1\n2\n∫\ndθ(r2\ni(θ) −˜r2\ni(θ)), ˜Ai = 1\n2\n∫\ndθ(˜ri(θ)2 −ri+1(θ)2) (25)\nand to leading order in ﬂuctuations we get that the variations in the area are given by\nδAi =\n∫\ndθ(riδri(θ) −˜riδ˜ri(θ)),δ ˜Ai =\n∫\ndθ(˜riδ˜ri(θ) −ri+1δri+1(θ)) (26)\nBecause the areas are quantized in natural units due to Dirac quantization condition, we\nneed to require that the δAi = δ˜Ai = 0, and this implies that\n∫\ndθδri(θ) =\n∫\ndθδ˜ri(θ) = 0 (27)\nWe infer that the ﬂuctuations have a Fourier expansion with the zero mode missing for each\nﬂuctuation.\nFor quantization, we also need the Poisson bracket between the δri(θ). This was calcu-\nlated in [24]. One can derive it from the Hamiltonian and locality in θ. Basically, we need\nthat\n{H,δri(θ)}= ˙ri(θ) = −∂θri(θ) (28)\nand similarly for δ˜ri. Since the energy function is the Hamiltonian, the Poisson bracket is\nas follows\n{δri(θ),δrj(φ)}= δij\nN2rj(θ)2 ∂φδ(θ−φ) (29)\nwhereas for the other variables we ﬁnd a sign change\n{δ˜ri(θ),δ˜rj(φ)}= − δij\nN2˜rj(θ)2 ∂φδ(θ−φ) (30)\nthat follows because the Hamiltonian for the δ˜ris actually negative deﬁnite. The cross term\nvanishes.\nWe interpret the prefactor in front of the derivative of the delta function as an eﬀective\nnotion of the Planck constant ℏ for the corresponding background ﬁeld determined by the\ngeometric data. As is usual in the AdS/CFT correspondence, ℏ scales as 1/N2, and this is\nthe normalized Newton constant 2.\n2 Notice that if we scaler,δr by the same scale factor to remove the 1/N2 pieces, we ﬁnd that the normalized\nvalue of the radius R then scales as R≃\n√\nN, and the area of the disk is proportional to N.\n17\nWith these conventions, the canonically normalized ﬂuctuating ﬁelds φC, and ˜φC depend\non the values of the geometric parameters ri,˜ri, as follows\nφC\ni (θ) = Nriδri(θ) = N\n2 δ(r2\ni(θ)) (31)\nand similarly for ˜φC. The Fourier modes of the φC,˜φC will have canonical commutation\nrelations, such that\nφC\ni (θ) =\n∑\nn\nφC\ni,nexp(inθ) (32)\nand\n{φC\ni,n,φC\nj,m}= nδijδn,m (33)\nwhereas for the ˜φ we get a sign change\n{˜φC\ni,n,˜φC\nj,m}= −nδijδn,m (34)\nOne can then show that the φC\nn,˜φC\nn are either raising or lowering operators with energy\nn,−n respectively (the ˜C ﬂuctuations reduce the energy).\nNow that we have our canonical mode ﬁelds, we can deﬁne the code subspaces as in\nsection II. We just take the concentric ring background conﬁguration and act with the\nraising operators φC\n−n,˜φC\nm a ﬁnite number of times, with a cutoﬀ on n,m and the number\nof raising operators acting on the reference state, which is speciﬁed by the radii, and the\nquantization condition that all the lowering modes of the eﬀective edge ﬁelds are in their\nground state. The precise details of the cutoﬀ are yet to be speciﬁed, and the result should\nbe understood to be a leading order approximation in a large N expansion, so there might\nbe 1/N corrections that need to be studied more carefully.\nNotice that the deﬁnition of the code subspace is fairly straightforward, but the deter-\nmination of the eﬀective modes took some work. It also assumes a particular action of the\nmodes of the ﬁelds on the reference state and by relying heavily on the classical analysis in\ngravity, we do not have a direct access to how the cutoﬀ should be correctly implemented.\nA second issue that needs attention is to make sure that the code subspace that we have\ndeﬁned this way is compatible with the holographic boundary operator actions. That is,\nwe want to show that acting with the operators that preserve the supersymmetry and that\nare realized in the boundary does not take us out of the code subspace. To do this, we\nneed to notice that the boundary operators measure the multipole moments of the droplet\n18\ndistribution. These can be written as follows\nφn ≃\n∫\nρ(r,θ) [rexp(−iθ)]nrdrdθ (35)\nwhere ρ is the region of the plane that is ﬁlled. After some manipulations where we do the\nradial integral ﬁrst [25], these modes are written as follows\nφn = 1\nn+ 2\n∫ ∑\ni\n[ri(θ) exp(−iθ)]nr2\ni(θ) −[˜ri(θ) exp(−iθ)]n ˜r2\ni(θ)dθ (36)\nTo linearized order we have that ri(θ) = ri + δri(θ), so we ﬁnd that\nφn =\n∫ ∑\ni\n[\nrn+1\ni δri(θ) exp(−inθ) −˜rn+1\ni δri(θ) exp(−inθ)\n]\ndθ (37)\nwhich in terms of the canonical ﬁelds becomes\nφn = N−1\n∑\ni\n[\nrn\ni φC\ni,n −˜rn\ni ˜φC\ni,n\n]\n(38)\nThe factor of 1 /N in the prefactor is to be thought of as\n√\nℏ, which is the standard size for\nquantum ﬂuctuations. In this sense, we should remove it and the normalized operator for\nboundary insertions should be given by\nˆφn =\n∑\ni\n[\nrn\ni φC\ni,n −˜rn\ni ˜φC\ni,n\n]\n(39)\nWith these conventions we have that for the ground state where r1 = 1 and all other ri,˜ri\nvanish, we have that\nˆφn = φC\n1,n (40)\nSince the ﬁeld ˆφis in general clearly a linear combination of operators in the code subspace,\nit belongs to the code subspace. To go beyond linearized order, we need to normal order the\nexpressions. The non-linear terms that are generated will be polynomials in φC\ni,n and ˜φC\ni,n\nsuppressed by additional powers 1 /N.\nWhat we want to do now is reproduce these same results without relying on the semi-\nclassical description, but directly in terms of the matrix variables. What is important for\nus is that the concentric circle conﬁgurations have a simple description in terms of Young\ntableaux [8]. Therefore it is possible to analyze the physics of the cutoﬀ in terms of the trace\nvariables as in section III. This will permit us to describe the cutoﬀs better and to verify\ndirectly the expression (39). This can be understood as a test of the LLM geometry map.\nWe will tackle this problem in the next section.\n19\nV. CODE SUBSPACES IN THE YOUNG TABLEAUX FORMALISM\nAs is by now well understood, concentric ring classical conﬁgurations in the LLM plane\ncorrespond to Young tableaux with only a few corners (see [16] for more details). A typical\nsuch Young tableaux looks as portrayed in the diagram (41)\n... M 1\n...\n... L 1\n... M 2\n...\n... L 2\n...\n(41)\nwhere the length of the long rows are of size M1,M2,... , and the depth of the columns\nis L1,L2,... . With these conventions, the empty corners to the right of the Mi (concave\ncorners) have coordinates given by\n(i,j) ∈{(M1 + 1,1),(M2 + 1,L1 + 1),... (Mk + 1,Lk−1 + 1)} (42)\nSimilarly, the convex corners of the edge of the tableaux are given by the coordinates\n(i,j) ∈{(M1,L1) ... (Mk,Lk)} (43)\nWe will call this state the reference state |Ω⟩. It is around this state that we want to\nbuild an eﬀective ﬁeld theory of the LLM states that mirrors the gravity construction. To\nsuch a tableaux with widely spread out corners we can associate a Hilbert space of small\nﬂuctuations. These are additional small tableaux that can be attached to each corner. In\nthe young diagram depicted in (44), we see an example of adding a small tableaux to the\nconcave corner depicted with the symbol + and also a tableaux that is substracted from the\nconvex corner and depicted with the symbol −. This idea was originally sketched in [18],\nbut was not fully realized at the time. It was implemented in the strict N →∞ limit in\n[14] and better estimates for various quantities were obtained in [15].\n20\nHere we have a full implementation of the details at ﬁnite N.\n... + +\n+...\n...\n−\n−−\n(44)\nIt is easy to see that we can deﬁne a small Hilbert space for each corner. This Hilbert\nspace is the set of small Young tableaux (whose sides are much smaller than the sides of\nthe big tableaux with few corners). There will generically be two types of corners: the ones\nthat have + boxes, and the ones that have −boxes. These correspond to the two types of\ncorners of the reference tableaux. For convenience, we will label them with the ( i,j) values\nof the ﬁrst corner that we can add or substract, and each of these corner Hilbert spaces will\nbe called H(i.j). By construction, we ﬁnd the small Hilbert space of states relative to the\nreference state |Ω⟩, which we will call the code subspace, can be decomposed as follows\nHcode|Ω⟩=\n∏\nk\nH(Mk+1,Lk−1+1) ⊗\n∏\nk\nH(Mk,Lk) (45)\nAs of yet, we have not speciﬁed the size of the factors of code subspace. We will proceed\nto do this later. What we need to do right now is to understand in a little more detail the\nH(i.j) factors. The idea is that each of these is characterized by a Young diagram. There\nare two cases to consider: the + subspaces and the −subspaces.\nLet us begin with the + subspaces. These are labeled by H(Mk+1,Lk−1+1). What we\nare interested in to begin with are the factors associated with adding and substracting\nboxes, as in equation (22). We will use new sets of relative labels to the reference corner\n(∆i,∆j) = (i−Mk,j −Lk−1). In this way the square root factors from before read\n(\n1 + i−j\nN\n)1/2\n→\n(\n1 + Mk −Lk−1\nN + ∆i −∆j\nN\n)1/2\n≃\n(\n1 + Mk −Lk−1\nN\n)1/2\n(46)\nin the limit where N is large and the ∆ i,∆j are of order one.\nWhen we add a skew hook with sboxes to a Young diagram that belongs H(Mk+1,Lk−1+1),\nwe would associate the factor (\n1 + Mk −Lk−1\nN\n)s/2\n(47)\n21\nand we need to identify this with an action as we would have in equation (39). The correct\nidentiﬁcation to have a match is that\nrk =\n(\n1 + Mk −Lk−1\nN\n)1/2\n(48)\nWith this, we ﬁnd that\nr2\nk = 1 + Mk −Lk−1\nN (49)\nso that the Mk,Lk−1 are clearly geometric. To have rk of order one, we need Mk,Lk−1 to be\nof order N. For convenience, we add L0 = 0 so that the uppermost corner can be treated\nuniformly with the others.\nThe idea now is that to each such corner we will assign a set of variables tk,ℓ := tMk,Lk−1,ℓ\nlabeled by an integer ℓ, such that they act as traces in the small Young tableaux alone. That\nis, we write is as follows\n⟨ˆYk + h|tk,n|ˆYk⟩= (−1)H(h)δ|h|,n (50)\nwhere Yk is the small Young tableaux in the corner.\nNow we need to do something similar with the convex corners. The beginning setup is\nthe same, starting at the ( Mk,Lk) corner but now we are substracting boxes. The relative\ncoordinates will now be given by\n(∆i,∆j) = (Lk −j,Mk −i) (51)\nso that they are both positive. Notice that we have switched the i,j labels in the deﬁnition\nof the left. With this convention we get that the corresponding square root factor is still of\nthe form\n(\n1 + i−j\nN\n)1/2\n=\n(\n1 + Mk −Lk\nN + ∆i −∆j\nN\n)1/2\n−→\nN→∞\n(\n1 + Mk −Lk\nN\n)1/2\n(52)\nwhere both ∆i and ∆j appear with the same sign as before. Notice that ∆ i increases as we\ngo up the diagram, and ∆ j increases as we go to the left. This way we ﬁnd that\n˜r2\nk = 1 + Mk −Lk\nN (53)\nWhat this means is that the vertical direction in the −tableaux should be thought of in a\nsimilar way to the horizontal direction in a + tableaux, and similarly the horizontal direction\nin the −tableaux should be thought of as the vertical direction in a + tableaux. That is,\n22\nthe conventions for the tableaux are reﬂected. We now want to introduce ˜tk,ℓ variables that\nact only in convex corners. To get an equation that works as (50), we need to modify it to\nlook as follows\n⟨ˆY˜k + h|˜tk,n|ˆY˜k⟩= (−1)W(h)δ|h|,n (54)\nwhere instead of measuring the height of the skew hook, we measure the width of the skew\nhook in the −boxes. For hooks with an odd number of boxes, the vertical and horizontal\nparity coincide. Whereas for skew hooks with an even number of boxes, they are opposite.\nThis means that relative to the usual conventions, we have set up ˜tℓ to act as −tℓ for ℓeven.\nIt is more convenient to have ˜tℓ to have a uniform negative sign in all actions. This is done\nby changing signs in the deﬁnition of Y˜k →(−1)#boxesY˜k. That way both even and odd ˜tk,ℓ\nact with a minus sign relative to the usual convention.\nWe can now ask how tℓ acts on a state in the code subspace. It is straightforward to show\nthat in general we can write\ntℓ ≃\n∑\nk\n(\nrℓ\nktk,ℓ −˜rℓ\nk ˜t†\nk,ℓ\n)\n(55)\nwhich is an equation that seems identical to equation (39). The minus sign for the˜tvariables\nis the minus sign that we just introduced. This is part of the deﬁnition of how the˜Y diagrams\nshould be understood.\nBecause the diﬀerent tk,˜tk act on diﬀerent subfactors of Hcode, they automatically com-\nmute. Moreover, they also commute with each other’s adjoints. The only non trivial com-\nmutation relations are between tk and their own adjoint, or between ˜tk and their adjoints.\nTo get a good match we need to show that the tk,˜tk variables should have canonical commu-\ntation relations. This was proven in our previous work [14] for tableaux without restrictions.\nSince the tableaux are restricted in size, this cannot be true for general states. After all,\nthe representation of a harmonic oscillator algebra is always inﬁnite. This is the ﬁrst formal\ncutoﬀ we encounter. The commutation relations that we need\n[t†\nk,ℓ,tk,m] = ℓδℓ,m (56)\nshould be valid inside the factor of the code subspace, but only when sandwiched between\nstates in the code subspace. If the tk,ℓ take us out of the code subspace, then we need to\ndeﬁne their action. The bounds are implicit in that the small tableaux have small sizes, and\nthe deﬁnition of their limits is still to be determined more carefully. Here we see that the\n23\nlanguage of the code subspace is helping us to understand that the commutation relations\nwe need are valid in a restricted subspace of the Hilbert space, and they can be arbitrary\noutside. The language of these relations automatically assumes that we are inside the code\nsubspace. This is also the way the code subspaces do their work in [4].\nNow, by construction we have that multiplication by the tk,ℓ,˜tk,ℓ act as raising operators\nin the small factors. Since tℓ adds boxes and ˜tk,ℓ substracts them, ˜tℓ is more similar to t†\nℓ.\nThat is why we need to write the equation (55) with daggered operators for the ˜tvariables.\nFor convenience, since multiplying bytk,ℓ is like a raising operator and their adjoint is like\na lowering operator, we will rewrite the equation in a more standard Fock space language.\nWe do this by stating that\ntk,ℓ →b†\nk,ℓ (57)\n˜tk,ℓ →c†\nk,ℓ (58)\nt†\nk,ℓ →bk,ℓ (59)\n˜t†\nk,ℓ →ck,ℓ (60)\nThese identiﬁcations are valid inside the code subspace. The b,c oscillators have canonical\ncommutation relations. The action of tk,ℓ becomes\ntℓ =\n∑\nk\n(\nrℓ\nkb†\nk,ℓ −˜rℓ\nkck,ℓ + O(1/N)\n)\n(61)\nand we ignore the 1/Ncorrections when we match to supergravity. Now it is clear that (61) is\nidentical in form to (39). Where the ﬁeld modes have canonical commutation relations, just\nlike the supergravity modes do. This implements the requirements of equation (39) exactly.\nThat is, the code subspace in the Young tableaux basis can be put into correspondence\nexactly with the code subspace in supergravity.\nMoreover, we have seen that there is an implicit cutoﬀ on the size of the small tableaux.\nThis is not immediately apparent in the supergravity construction where one is formally\ntaking the limit N →∞ ﬁrst. To argue for the cutoﬀs, one needs to follow [26] and argue\nthat a type of stringy exclusion principle (similar to [27]) is responsible for a cutoﬀ on the\nnumber of modes and their amplitudes. To proceed further, we need to understand the\nimplicit cutoﬀs explicitly and explore the physics that is beyond classical supergravity.\n24\nVI. CUTOFF PHYSICS IN THE YOUNG TABLEAUX FORMALISM\nThe ﬁrst step in the process of understanding the cutoﬀ is to describe when the lin-\nearization implied by equation (55) is correct. In essence, we want to understand how when\nmultiplying by tℓ, the subleading terms in N in the expression (46) or (52) accumulate when\nwe vary ℓand take ℓlarge. This limit will give us a UV cutoﬀ on the eﬀective modes beyond\nwhich non-linearities matter.\nThe idea is that the products on each skew hook will be of the form\n|⟨ˆYk + h|tℓ|ˆYk⟩|=\nα+ℓ∏\nk=α+1\n(\nr2\nm + k/N\n)1/2\n= rℓ\nmexp(\n∑\nk\nlog(1 + k/(Nr2\nm))) (62)\nand we will look at cases where rm is of order 1 and k <<N. The term in the exponential\ncan be further approximated by\n∑\nk\nk/(Nr2\nm)) = O(ℓ2/(Nr2\nm)) (63)\nWe want these corrections to be small for each skew hook, which means that we want in\ngeneral ℓ2/(Nr2\nm) << 1. That means that we should have the label ℓ scaling at most as\nℓ<ϵN 1/2 where ϵ is a small number (this is the same scaling that is observed in studies of\nthe BMN string [17], that ends up being a special case of the LLM geometries: the vacuum\ngeometry). For us it is a choice that tells us how big of an error we should allow. A similar\n(slightly weaker) limit is obtained from three point functions [28] (see also [29] and references\ntherein for earlier work on the exact three point functions).\nThat is, the code subspaces associated with the corners have a bound on the size of skew\nhooks. We also want the bound to apply to excited states, so all the ∆ i and ∆ j should\nalso ﬁt in this bound. In essence, the allowed Young tableaux on each corner is essentially\na tableaux that ﬁts in a square of order\n√\nN ×\n√\nN around each corner. If the Li,Mi are\nwell separated from each other, the diﬀerent tableaux on each corner cannot interfere with\neach other, because the horizontal or vertical diﬀerence between the corners is of order N.\nSince such a small tableaux has energy that is equal to the number of boxes in the tableaux,\nthis means that the excitation energy above (below) the reference state is bounded and of\norder at most N. This is subleading in the supergravity description, because the energy of\nthe supergravity solutions is of order N2, but it is also a typical energy of a single giant\ngraviton who scale is of order the AdS radius. This limit where the linear structure starts\n25\nbreaking down is due to 1/N corrections given by interactions of the local string excitations\n(as perceived by the extrapolate dictionary).\nRemember that the Planck scale quanta are associated to energies of order N1/4. An\nenergy of order N1/2 is roughly the energy of a Planck sized object that has been boosted\nby an ultra-relativistic factor of γ ≃N1/4. This means that the physics of these modes does\nnot break down at the Planck scale, but at much higher energies and the notion of (local)\nLorentz invariance for single particle states should be well respected at energies of order the\nPlanck scale itself. Since the total size of the circle associated with the edge of the droplet\nis of order N1/4lP, the Lorentz contraction obtained from a boost of N1/4 gives an eﬀective\ncircle of size ℓP (similar boost arguments have been used to describe matrix black holes [30]).\nIn essence, the physics is breaking down when for a boosted object at the Planck scale, the\nLorentz contracted circle on which it is moving is of order the Planck length.\nOur description of the cutoﬀ is that the allowed Young tableaux need to ﬁt inside a\nsquare of size wi ×wi where each wi scales as N1/2. We can restrict the action of the b,c\nmodes so that if a skew hook falls outside these squares we get zero. This would modify\nthe canonical commutation relations between these modes only for tableaux that are nearly\nﬁlling the allowed squares. Also, the restriction in depth is similar to the restriction that\nrepresentations for SU(M) vanish if their associated Young tableaux have a column of length\nlarger than or equal to M. This restriction makes traces of length larger than or equal to M\ndependent non-linearly on the smaller traces (these are the Mandelstam relations and they\nare closely related to the Cayley Hamilton relation, see for example [31]). The additional\nb,c modes become (non-linearly) redundant when we hit this bound. The maximal bound\non ℓfor each of the b,c modes is ﬁxed by the size of the square regions, and all small Young\ntableaux states can be generated from the action of b,c, modes with these cutoﬀs (as long\nas we act by zero when we get out of the conﬁning boxes).\nVII. UNCERTAINTY AND ENTROPY\nIn our previous work we argued that in the strict N →∞ case one could calculate the\ntopology of LLM geometries by measuring the uncertainty and the entropy of the mode\nexpansion for the tℓ actions on the corresponding Young tableaux state. Our purpose now\nis to understand how the answer changes when we take N ﬁnite, or more precisely, when we\n26\ntake N to be very large and the L,M scale with N. In this way, we can take equation (39)\nor equivalently (61) and compute the uncertainties for the actions by traces. The result is\nvery simple, by using Wick’s theorem in the b,c oscillators (this is the original technique we\nused in [20], with the understanding that the tails of distributions contribute a very small\namount). This is combinatorially equivalent to computing directly with the Young tableaux\n[14, 15], and we get the following answers\n⟨t†\nstm⟩Ω = sδsm\n∑\ni\nr2m\ni ≡sδsmSm (64)\n⟨tmt†\ns⟩Ω = sδsm\n∑\ni\n˜r2m\ni ≡sδsm˜Sm (65)\nfor the reference state |Ω⟩.\nFor the previous case studied by us, the answers are given by specializing to ri = ˜ri = 1\nfor all i, in which case we would immediately get the number of edges and anti edges by\ncomputing these expectation values.\nWhat we see in this case is that now the answer on the right hand side is geometric. We\nget an algebraic sum of the powers of the ri, or the powers of the ˜ri. These are symmetric\nfunctions of the ri or the ˜ri respectively. If there is a ﬁnite number of these given by\nNedges,Nanti−edges, we will ﬁnd that there are algebraic relations between them. The ﬁrst\norder for a non-trivial relation will be exactly when we have enough variables on the left\nhand side above to be able to compute the ri by solving for the roots of a polynomial.\nTo obtain the coeﬃcients Ai of the polynomial equation from the Sm, one uses Newton’s\nequations given as follows\nA1 + S1 = 0 (66)\n2A2 + S1A1 + S2 = 0 (67)\n... (68)\nnAn + S1AN−1 + ··· + SN−1A1 + Sn = 0 (69)\nOnce we pass the point where we have saturated the number of the diﬀerent ri, the corre-\nsponding An will vanish: the rest of the putative ri,˜ri would vanish 3.\nIn this sense, it is possible to get the topology for a concentric LLM geometry. One can\nfollow a similar argument for coherent states of the b,c oscillators, only as long as the notion\n3 The Si are also Schur polynomials related to the totally antisymmetric representation for a matrix with\neigenvalues ri or ˜ri.\n27\nof coherent states ﬁts nicely within the cutoﬀs of the code subspace that were discussed in\nthe previous section. In this sense, the deformations away from circularity of the droplets are\nof subleading order in N. The easiest way to see this is that a classical shape deformation\nshould typically cost an energy of order N2, but the cutoﬀ windows we have discussed only\nallows for changes in energy of order N.\nGoing a little bit further in comparison to our previous work, we notice that as long as\nwe ignore the cutoﬀs, we can think of tℓ ∝a†\nℓ and t†\nℓ ∝a as raising and lowering operators\nthemselves. To go from the b,c oscillators to the a oscillators we are writing a partial\nBogoliubov transformation (we have less a’s than b and c combined).\nAn important question is what is the normalization of the oscillators. This can be used\nto compute the expectation value of the number operators. This can be done by computing\nthe commutator as follows\n⟨[t†\nℓ,tℓ]⟩Ω = ℓ\n∑\ni\nr2ℓ\ni −ℓ\n∑\ni\n˜r2ℓ\ni = ℓ(Sℓ −˜Sℓ) = ℏeff (70)\nand on the right hand side we identify this with an eﬀective ℏ in the commutation relation.\nThe expectation value of the number operator evaluated on the reference state |Ω⟩, which\ndeﬁnes our vacuum, is then\nnℓ = ⟨ˆNℓ⟩Ω = ⟨tℓt†\nℓ⟩Ω\nℏeff\n= ⟨a†a⟩Ω\n[a,a†] =\n˜Sℓ\nSℓ −˜Sℓ\n(71)\nSimilarly we have that\nnℓ + 1 = ⟨ˆNℓ + 1⟩Ω = Sℓ\nSℓ −˜Sℓ\n(72)\nFrom these expectation values we can assign an entropy to the linear modeaℓ. This is the\nentanglement entropy of the mode ain the vacuum Ω, and since the vacuum is obtained by\na partial Bogoliubov transformation, we get that the reduced density matrix for the modes\na,a† look thermal. This entropy is given by\nsℓ = (nℓ + 1) log(nℓ + 1) −nℓlog(nℓ) (73)\nwhich is again dependent on the geometric radii ri,˜ri.\nThe meaning of this entropy is clear in the N →∞ limit where we are analyzing an\neﬀective ﬁeld theory, but at ﬁnite N it is more problematic because of all the cutoﬀs.\nOne way to think about this entropy is that since the modes a,a† act simply on the code\n28\nsubspace, they should induce an (approximate) factorization in the code subspace itself.\nMore precisely, we can assign an entropy to an algebra Aacting on the reference state Ω.\nThe idea is that we need to produce a representation of the algebra by acting on Ω with the\nalgebra, as follows HA≃Span{OΩ}.\nThis induces a reduced density matrix for the Afactor such that\ntr(ρO) = ⟨Ω|O|Ω⟩ (74)\nand we can associate the entropy sℓ with it. If the algebra Aacts in such a way that no\nelement of the algebra annihilates the state, there is a second copy of A, A∗ that acts on\nHA and commutes with A. This second copy can be thought of as the thermal double of A\n(this is the Tomita-Takesaki theory, as discussed in [11]). Roughly speaking, the state will\nlook as follows\n∑\nn\nζn|n⟩|˜n⟩ (75)\nwhere the ζn are a collection of numbers and the |n⟩enumerate the possible states for\nthe algebra A(for the Weyl algebra of a harmonic oscillator, there is a unique irreducible\nrepresentation, so we enumerate the states by the occupation number). To avoid the inﬁnite\nsize representation and ﬁt inside the code subspace, we just need to truncate to states\nwhose occupation number is bellow a cutoﬀ induced by the code subspaces themselves. The\nassociated density matrix would be\nρ≃\n∑\nn\n|ζn|2|n⟩⟨n| (76)\nand the dual algebra would act on the |˜n⟩states but not on the |n⟩states. For the states\nat hand, as long as the ζn →0 suﬃciently fast (which is usually true in an approximately\nthermal state), if the algebra is truncated or not becomes a moot point: the entropy is going\nto be dominated by the ζn where n is small anyhow.\nIn the case above, we think of the representation space of A∗ as a puriﬁcation of ρ, so\nthe A∗ should be associated to the puriﬁcation inside Ω for the generators of the oscillator\nalgebra a,a†. Because we have a partial Bogoliubov transformation, we can compute this\npuriﬁcation directly in terms of modes of the eﬀective oscillators.\n29\nThe idea is as follows. Consider the two eﬀective oscillators given by\nB†\nn = 1√Sn\n∑\nrn\ni b(i)†\nn (77)\nC†\nn = 1√˜Sn\n∑\n˜rn\ni c(i)†\nn (78)\nIt is easy to check that these oscillators are normalized, and that the state |Ω⟩is the ground\nstate for the B,C oscillators. From these oscillators it follows that\ntn =\n√\nSnB†\nn −\n√\n˜SnCn (79)\nand now it looks like part of a Bogoliubov transformation between only two modes. Nor-\nmalizing the mode of the left hand side, which we will call a†\nn, we need to take\na†\nn := tn√\nℏeff\n= 1√\nSn −˜Sn\n(\n√\nSnB†\nn −\n√\n˜SnCn) = cosh(γn)B†\nn −sinh(γn)Cn (80)\nand similarly for its adjoint. The mode a†\nn is entangled with the mode\nd†\nn = cosh(γn)C†\nn −sinh(γn)Bn (81)\nthat acts as the puriﬁcation of the an mode. Indeed, the B,C oscillators can be recovered\nfrom a,d, and the ground state is a pure state of the B,C modes. It is easy to check that the\nstate |Ω⟩in the a,d basis is a squeezed state between the the a,d modes. When tracing over\nd we get a thermal density matrix for a, whose entropy is determined by the expectation\nvalue of the number operator: it maximizes the entropy given the constraint.\nWhat is important for us is that the modes B, C for moderately large nare concentrated\non the outermost edge of the concentric circle conﬁguration, and the outermost anti-edge.\nThat is, most of the weight of the B,C oscillators is concentrated on the modes at r1 and ˜r1\nrespectively b(1),c(1). The amplitudes for the other modes are exponentially suppressed in\nn. What this means is that for generic modes, the extrapolate dictionary can not penetrate\nbeyond the geometric locus characterized by ˜r1. By the Tomita -Takesaki analysis of [11], we\ncan generate the states |n⟩a|m⟩d from the state |Ω⟩by acting with aalone. In practice, this\nmeans we can recover the algebra of the d modes with an ensemble by having the reference\nground state.\nNotice that the extrapolate dictionary seems to stop exactly at the outermost anti-edge.\nThis was also suggested by the work of [21], which argued that there was an entanglement\n30\nshadow in these geometries (a region where extremal Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces [32] can not\npenetrate) and that the extremal surface that can enter the deepest stops exactly at this\nplace.\nIn practice what this means is that the information inside the region of the outermost\nanti-edge is inaccessible. One can equally say that it is protected from quantum errors\ngenerated by acting with the extrapolate dictionary. This information is encoded in the\nmodes b,c that are orthogonal to B,C.\nOverall, the ﬁnite N picture is similar to what we found before in [14, 20]. The topology\ncan be deduced from the uncertainties, although the procedure is more complicated. Also the\nentropy of the extrapolate dictionary modes is maximal given those uncertainties. Similar\narguments can be used when we shift the reference ground state to a coherent state of the\nb,c modes that ﬁts comfortably inside the code subspace.\nVIII. OBSTRUCTIONS TO HAVING A GLOBALLY WELL DEFINED\nQUANTUM METRIC\nSo far, we have found ourselves with a cutoﬀ that is of order\n√\nN on the modes, and we\nhave assumed that the spacing between the radii is of order one. From the point of view of\nYoung tableaux, this is a situation where the lengths of the horizontal or vertical edges of\nthe reference state are of order N. Our goal now is to push ourselves to a situation where\nwe make some of these edges small enough so that the cutoﬀ of\n√\nN is already too large.\nThat is, we want to take Mi −Mi+1 or Li −Li+1 to be of order\n√\nN themselves. The idea\nnow is to understand to what extent it is possible for us to deﬁne a metric operator in these\nsetups. We only need to analyze the simplest case, with L1 ≃\n√\nN, as in (87), and we will\ncall this reference state |Ω1⟩.\n... M1\nL1\n(82)\nTo analyze how one might get interference between the rows, we need to also analyze another\nreference state ... S1\nL1\n(83)\n31\nwith S1 = M1 + 1. This reference state diﬀers from the previous one by adding one column,\nand call this reference state |Ω2⟩. The idea now is to look for a state that belongs to the\ncode subspace generated from |Ω1⟩and |Ω2⟩. The idea is to check if it is possible to ﬁnd a\nglobally deﬁned metric that agrees between the two code subspaces as understood above in\nterms of building up perturbations relative to the reference state. The simplest such state\nis given by ... M1\n...\nP\nL1\n...\n(84)\nwhere we have a column of length P added to |Ω1⟩and that can be thought of as removing\na column of length L1 −P to |Ω2⟩.\nThe ﬁrst state can be thought of as a superposition of states that have excitations around\n|Ω1⟩which are built from the b†\nΩ1 modes. Such states are superpositions of excitations of the\ntop edge r1|Ω1. Relative to the reference state |Ω2⟩, they are instead built by superpositions\nof modes c†\nΩ2, which originate in ˜r1|Ω2. From the point of view of the two diﬀerent code\nsubspaces, we attach the excitation to diﬀerent edges. This assignment is not local: we\ncannot specify the edge uniquely in a way that is independent of the reference state. The\nanswer depends on the choice of reference state. We can even do this with superpositions of\nstates of this type that lead to coherent states (for example, in [14] it was understood that\na particular generating series of these states is a coherent state). Such generating series are\nof the type\n∑\nP\nξP|P⟩Ω1 (85)\n∑\nP\n˜ξL1−P|L1 −P⟩Ω2 (86)\nwhere ξ is a complex number. In order to get the same state, we need that ξ = 1/˜ξ. In\nour previous work, the range for P was inﬁnite, so convergence required that |ξ|< 1 and\nsimilarly for ˜ξ, so naively only one such state can be a nice coherent state. In practice,\nbecause of the cutoﬀs, the superposed coherent state does not belong completely to either\nof the two code subspaces nor is it exactly a coherent state, but the state can have a large\noverlap with states that do belong to either code subspace. The condition for large overlap\nis that |ξ|<1 or |˜ξ|<1. However, the state at ﬁxed P is a superposition of objects of either\n32\ntype. Indeed, these objects are D-branes (giant gravitons [26]) that can be thought of as\nhaving nucleated at one edge (and belonging to it) and being moved to the other edge. This\nis shown in ﬁgure 3. Indeed, one can deﬁne a third code subspace that is a strip geometry\nplus a D-brane. In one code subspace the state is an excitation of r1, in a second code\nsubspace, the state is an excitation of ˜r1 and in the third code subspace the state is a strip\ngeometry plus a D-brane (this is interpreted as a state with a diﬀerent topology than the\nother two).\nFIG. 3. LLM diagrams of three (identical) states with D-brane excitations that can be thought of\nas having nucleated in diﬀerent ways in diﬀerent code subsapces, and this results on them being\npictured diﬀerently.\nNow, it is clear that there is no absolute boundary between these. The cutoﬀs are of order\n√\nN, but can be adjusted. What this means is that in practice |Ω1⟩and |Ω2⟩do not deﬁne a\nsingle code subspace. They deﬁne families of code subspaces that diﬀer by the cutoﬀs. The\nstate |P⟩Ω1 may or may not belong to either of these code subspaces.\nAlso notice that it gets more ambiguous when we try states of the form\n... M1\n... P2\nP ...\nL1\n...\n(87)\nThe ﬁrst column is either an excitation of the bmodes or the cmodes depending on the code\nsubspace, but the second column is an excitation of the b modes in both code subspaces.\nThe only condition on the Young tableaux is that P2 ≤P, but to belong to the diﬀerent\ncode subspaces, one needs to check that the cutoﬀs are not violated. We also ﬁnd that\n33\nthere is a new code subspace |Ω3⟩, with S2 = M1 + 2 where both of them would be assigned\nto excitations of ˜r1|Ω3. We can keep on going this way so that the ﬁrst w1 columns are c\nexcitations and the next one is a b excitation, versus all of them being b excitations. one\nalso gets code subspaces with one, two, up to w1 D-branes if one wants to. This ambiguity\nmakes it impossible to answer a question as to what is the metric as an operator that is\nindependent of the choice of code subspace. Each code subspace has a diﬀerent answer, and\nthey are not compatible with each other.\nIn this case we can even say that the code subspaces withD-branes have diﬀerent topology\nthan the two original reference states. They also have a diﬀerent spectrum of excitations:\napart for the b,c modes they also have the moduli of the D-branes themselves (these can be\nthought of as the additional coordinates ξ = ˜ξ−1 when we separate the D-branes from the\ncode subspaces).\nIf one states that the metric information is encoded in the state as a message, what we are\nseeing is that diﬀerent code subspaces that share the same state decode diﬀerent messages.\nIt is intriguing to speculate that diﬀerent messages (diﬀerent notions of the metric) are all\nallowed in the same sense that stringy dualities allow for more than one interpretation of the\ngeometry, but only one of them will be suﬃciently classical. From what we have determined\nso far it is not yet clear that this is what is going on. So far we have done calculations in\nthe absence of a concrete value for the string scale, relative to the Planck scale. To study\nthe physics of the string scale would require studying modes that do not preserve as much\nsupersymmetry. Such a problem is beyond the scope of the present paper.\nOne should be able to argue similarly for folded geometries. These geometries with folds\nare deﬁned by stating that the number of r,˜r variables is a function of the angle. The local\nsupergravity analysis of the Poisson structure around each edge is the same [24], but one\nwould have to deﬁne the mode expansions of the eﬀective ﬁelds carefully. Diﬀerent choices\nshould be generically related by a linear transformation of the mode functions on each edge\nto a new set of functions. Such diﬀerences are accounted for by a Bogoliubov transformation\nof the modes. There is no obvious preferred basis distinguished by the energy of the modes,\nbecause the reference state is no longer an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Unfortunately\nthe dual ﬁeld theory analysis is much more complicated because the construction of the\ncorresponding dual states is not combinatorial. Our previous work [14, 20] dealt with these\ngeometries in a particular approximation, but this approximation was not deduced from ﬁrst\n34\nprinciples. Studying this problem is very interesting as it should provide further details. Such\nanalysis is beyond the scope of the present paper.\nIX. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we draw parallels between eﬀective ﬁeld theory, especially within the frame-\nwork of the LLM geometries, and the notion of holographic code subspaces. We found that\nthe nearby Hilbert space of states around some classical background, which is built by acting\non the reference state with some number of eﬀective ﬁelds results in a space deﬁned in the\nsame way as the code subspace developed in [4]. It further matches the little Hilbert space of\n[22]. We give explicit examples of code subspaces in the case of the LLM geometries, where\nwe use concentric ring conﬁgurations as our reference state. To analyze this, we go beyond\nthe inﬁnite N limit of our previous work. We show that the allowed eﬀective ﬁelds are\ncomprised of state dependent operators, insofar as analyzing the metric of a state depends\non a choice of a code subspace in which to analyze it. Further, we ﬁnd that there is not a\nclear line between diﬀerent code subspaces, and, in fact, there are states that clearly belong\nto multiple such subspaces. This makes it ambiguous to write down a globally well deﬁned\nmetric operator, as the interpretation of how to obtain a metric depends on the reference\nstate that one builds the code space from. We have argued that this obstruction is essen-\ntially what forces us to state that it is only possible to interpret physics in an eﬀective ﬁeld\ntheory of gravity within the framework of code subspaces. If one thinks of the geometry of\na quantum state as a quantum message, diﬀerent code subspaces decode diﬀerent messages\nfrom the same state.\nIn this paper we dealt essentially exclusively with concentric ring LLM geometries. This\nis because the dual ﬁeld theory states are well understood as combinatorial objects. In prin-\nciple, a similar answer can be obtained for more general geometries, which can include folds\n(these are dealt in an approximate way in [14]). These geometries with folds are character-\nized by the fact that the number of r,˜rvariables is a function of the angle. The supergravity\nanalysis is more complicated because the modes necessarily mix in the extrapolate dictio-\nnary, and the cutoﬀs might depend non-trivially in the angle. These are interesting avenues\nof future research that can not be treated with the Young diagram technique. To address\nthese, one should understand the cutoﬀs directly in the supergravity description.\n35\nAnother setup that is interesting is to deal with the superstar ensemble (as in [33]), which\nhas properties more similar to a black hole. A big question here is to what extent we can use\ninformation the uncertainty and entropy in the extrapolate dictionary to make statements\nabout geometry. This is currently under research [34].\nSo far, all this work has been done for half BPS geometries. It would be very interesting\nto extend these ideas further to geometries that have less supersymmetry, or to excitations\naround such half BPS conﬁgurations that have less supersymmetry. Such excitations could\ngive additional insight into the more general structure of code subspaces and the correspond-\ning cutoﬀs. Some of these can even be stringy states.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nD.B. would like to thank V. Balasubramanian, J. de Boer, D. Kabat, J. Maldacena, O.\nParrikar, C. Rabideau for various discussions.

The list of irreps of Sn is in one to one corre-\nspondence with Young diagrams with n boxes. The cardinality of this set is also equal to\nthe cardinality of the set of conjugacy classes of the group Sn, which we label by a group\nelement representative [ σ]. The element σ acts on the set of n elements as a one to one\nfunction σ: {1,...n }→{ 1,...,n }, sending i→σ(i). We can also represent this as a cycle\ndecomposition\nσ= (n(1)\n1 n(1)\n2 ...n (1)\nk1 )(n(2)\n1 ...n (2)\nk2 ) ... (A1)\nwhere the set of elements {n(j)\nℓ }is the set {1,...n }. It follows that n = ∑ki Each m ∈\n{1,...,n }only appears once, and the elements on each parenthesis are called a cycle. We\ncan recover the action on the set by the convention that σ(n(j)\nm ) = n(j)\nm+1, with n(j)\nkj+1 ≡n(j)\n1 .\nBasically, the cycles represent the iterated action of σ on individual elements of the set\n{1,...n }. An individual cycle ( n(1)\n1 n(1)\n2 ...n (1)\nk1 ) is said to have length k1. We can choose the\nki to be non-decreasing by permuting the order in which the individual cycles are presented.\n36\nThis does not change the assignment of σ.\n[1] Juan Martin Maldacena, “The Large N limit of superconformal ﬁeld theories and super-\ngravity,” Int.
