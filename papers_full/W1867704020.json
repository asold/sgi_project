    "abstract": "Collinear high-gradient ${\\\\cal O} (GV/m)$ beam-driven wakefield methods for\\ncharged-particle acceleration could be critical to the realization of compact,\\ncost-efficient, accelerators, e.g., in support of TeV-scale lepton colliders or\\nmultiple-user free-electron laser facilities. To make these options viable, the\\nhigh accelerating fields need to be complemented with large transformer ratios\\n$&gt;2$, a parameter characterizing the efficiency of the energy transfer between\\na wakefield-exciting \"drive\" bunch to an accelerated \"witness\" bunch. While\\nseveral potential current distributions have been discussed, their practical\\nrealization appears challenging due to their often discontinuous nature. In\\nthis paper we propose several alternative current profiles which are smooth\\nwhich also lead to enhanced transformer ratios. We especially explore a\\nlaser-shaping method capable of generating one the suggested distributions\\ndirectly out of a photoinjector and discuss a linac concept that could possible\\ndrive a dielectric accelerator.\\n",
