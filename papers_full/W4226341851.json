  "abstract": "Nowadays, one of the most popular applications is cloud computing for storing data and information through World Wide Web. Since cloud computing has become available, users are rapidly increasing. Cloud computing enables users to obtain a better and more effective application at a lower cost in a more satisfactory way. Health services data must therefore be kept as safe and secure as possible because the release of this data could have serious consequences for patients. A framework for security and privacy must be employed to store and manage extremely sensitive data. Patients’ confidential health records have been encrypted and saved in the cloud using cypher text so far. To ensure privacy and security in a cloud computing environment is a big issue. The medical system has been designed as a standard, access of records, and effective use by medical practitioners as required. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm along with implementation details as an effective and secure E-health cloud model using identity-based cryptography. The comparison of the proposed and existing techniques has been carried out in terms of time taken for encryption and decryption, energy, and power. Decryption time has been decreased up to 50% with the proposed method of cryptography. As it will take less time for decryption, less power is consumed for doing the cryptography operations.",
