It is\nestimated that 70-90% of colorectal cancers originate from these\nadenomas, underscoring the critical importance of early risk\nprediction and screening ( 2–4). However, current screening\nmethods, including fecal examination, endoscopy, and CT\ncolonography (5, 6), have limitations that hinder their widespread\napplication. Fecal examination, while preferred for its comfort and\nsafety, has limited speciﬁcity. Endoscopy, the gold standard, is\ninvasive, technically demanding, and requires bowel preparation,\nlimiting its application for large-scale screening ( 7). CT\ncolonography, a non-invasive and highly sensitive alternative,\nnecessitates specialized equipment, technical expertise, and\nrigorous patient preparation, along with radiation exposure (8).\nTo address these challenges, we proposed an innovative\napproach that leverages the power of machine learning and\nelectronic medical record (EMR) data for accurate and\nwidespread colorectal adenoma prediction. Machine learning\ntechniques have shown promising results in identifying adenomas\nfrom colonoscopy or pathology images ( 9–11). Additionally,\nresearchers have identi ﬁed signi ﬁcant risk factors, such as\nsmoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity-related indicators,\nthrough various analyses (12–14). However, existing studies lack\nindividualized risk classiﬁcation, limiting their clinical application.\nEMR data presents a valuable and suitable alternative for large-\nscale screening, and researchers have developed risk prediction\nmodels to guide high-risk patients towards colonoscopy, optimizing\nresource allocation (15–20). Nevertheless, previous studies have\nbeen limited by small sample sizes and insufﬁcient EMR data.\nTraditional One-Hot coding of EMR data fails to capture\nsemantic information and is sensitive to missing data. In contrast,\nrecently popular pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have\nemerged as a promising solutio n, demonstrating superior\nperformance in extracting and encoding semantic information for\ndisease diagnosis and prognosis (21–23).\nBuilding upon these advancements, this study leverages\ncomprehensive EMR data, including medical history, symptoms,\ntests, and examinations. By utilizing a semantic vector model based\no nt h eB G E - M 3c o d i n ga p p r o a c h ,w ea i mt oi m p r o v ed a t a\ncomprehension, reduce sparsity, and improve generalization. This\nstudy aims to develop a robust risk prediction model for colorectal\nadenoma, providing real-time risk assessments to support informed\nclinical decision-making and ultimately improve patient outcomes.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 Dataset\nThis retrospective study utilized EMR data from January 2012\nto December 2023 at a high-performing hospital with an annual\noutpatient volume of approximately 4.5 million. The study was\napproved by the Medical Science Research Ethics Committee of ****\nhospital, and the requirement for patient informed consent was\nwaived due to the retrospective nature of this study. The data\ncollection process yielded a total of 2,951 positive and 108,995\nnegative samples. Figure 1 provides a detailed overview of the\nenrollment and data collection process.\nFIGURE 1\nPatient enrollment for colorectal adenoma.\nYang et al. 10.3389/fonc.2025.1508455\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org02\n2.1.1 Data inclusion and exclusion\nInclusion criteria for the study were as follows: (1) patients aged\n18 years or older at their initial visit; (2) pathology reports\nconﬁrming the presence of colorectal adenoma; (3) visits to the\ngastroenterology department with relevant diagnoses or pathology\nreports excluding colorectal adenoma.\nExclusion criteria were deﬁned as follows: (1) patients with a\nhistory of colectomy or partial colectomy; (2) medical histories or\ncurrent complaints involving conditions that could in ﬂuence\ninﬂammation assessment, including but not limited to colorectal\nadenoma, colorectal cancer, colon cancer, cecum cancer, rectal\ncancer, rectosigmoid junction cancer, inﬂammatory bowel disease,\ndiverticulitis, cirrhosis of the liver, abnormal liver function, acute\npancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, neuroendocrine tumor, capillary\ndilatation, lipoma, jaundice.\n2.1.2 Data splitting\nThe data from 2012 to 2022 was divided into the training\ncohort, consisting of a total of 2,469 positive samples and 90,212\nnegative samples. More recent data from 2023 was reserved as an\nindependent test cohort, comprising 482 positive samples and\n18,783 negative samples. The training cohort was utilized for\nmodel development and hyperparameter tuning using ﬁve-fold\ncross-validation, and the independent test cohort served to\nevaluate the generalizability of the developed model.\n2.1.3 EMR feature inclusion\nClinical EMR data (Table 1) comprises both structured and\nunstructured formats. Structured data, directly extracted from the\nEMR, included demographic information such as gender, age and\nlaboratory results. Laboratory items analyzed in this study\nencompassed glycated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, fecal occult\nblood test, complete blood count, biochemical pro ﬁle, and\ntumor markers.\nUnstructured data, such as the chief complaint, history of\npresent illness (HPI), and family history, required initial\ninformation extraction followed by content extraction to\ntransform them into a structured format. In this paper, a\nmultilevel entity-relationship extraction scheme was implemented\nto process free text data in EMR, consisting of two key steps: (1) we\ndistinguished medical record instruments and chapters by\n“instrument category prediction” and “chapter prediction”; (2) we\napplied a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-Conditional\nRandom Field (BiLSTM-CRF) network combined with rule\nmatching – a method that has been demonstrated as an effective\napproach for extracting information from unstructured data (24,\n25) - to extract the information from the Chinese clinical report.\nThese steps guarantee the extr action of clinically relevant\ninformation essential for subsequent predictive modeling. For this\nstudy, we utilized the earliest available laboratory and examination\ndata prior to the diagnosis of colorectal adenoma. Meanwhile, we\nexcluded the pathological examination items to prevent potential\ndata leakage during the model development process.\n2.1.4 Entity uniﬁcation\nTo ensure feature consistency, entity uni ﬁcation was\nimplemented on the raw clinical records, with data quality\ncontrol assured by semantic validation protocols. To avoid the\nvarious descriptions of entities such as signs, symptoms, and disease\nnames among physicians, we utilized the British Medical Journal\n(BMJ) Best Practice knowledge base (26). This resource uniﬁes\ndifferent aliases of each entity to a uniform name. Subsequently,\nthese diverse descriptions are mapped to their standardized entities,\neffectively reducing data fragmentation caused by alias\ndiscrepancies. For example, terms like“dry stools” and “increased\nbowel movements” were uniﬁed under the category of“abnormal\nstools”. Additionally, features with a missing rate of≥99% were\nexcluded to mitigate the risks of model overﬁtting and to improve\nthe stability and accuracy of the model.\nThe examination items within unstructured data\npredominantly comprise imaging studies, whose non-textual\ncharacteristics hinder structured dataset conversion. Therefore,\nTABLE 1 Sources and content of feature extraction.\nType Sources Content\nStructured Data\nMedical Records Homepage Gender, Age, etc.\nLaboratory Items All abnormal test data prior to the diagnosis of colorectal adenoma,\nincluding but not limited to Glycated Hemoglobin, Total Cholesterol, Fecal\nOccult Blood Test, Complete Blood Count, Biochemical Proﬁle, Tumor\nMarkers, etc.\nUnstructured Data\nChief Complaint/History of Present Illness (HPI) Hematochezia, Abnormal Stool, Colonic Polyps, Abdominal Pain, Acid\nReﬂux, Diarrhea, etc.\nFamily History Colorectal Cancer, etc.\nPhysical Examination Digital Rectal Exam, BMI, Systolic Blood Pressure, etc.\nPast Medical History Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, History of\nH. pylori Infection, etc.\nExamination Items Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT, etc.\nYang et al. 10.3389/fonc.2025.1508455\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org03\nthis study restricted analysis to text-based components of\nexamination reports, speciﬁcally the “examination observation”\nand “examination conclusion”. In order to ensure the objectivity\nof the results of the study, exclusion criteria were established: (1)\nExamination items directly related to the pathological diagnosis of\ncolorectal adenomas (including but not limited to colonoscopy,\npathological analysis, and tissue biopsy) were excluded; (2)\nExamination items retained were further excluded from the\nrecords whose text descriptions explicitly contained diagnostic\ninformation of colorectal adenomas.\n2.2 Prediction model development\nThe development of the colorectal adenoma risk prediction\nmodel is depicted in Figure 2 . This process begins with the\ncollection of comprehensive EMR data, including basic patient\ninformation, chief complaints, current and past medical histories,\nexamination reports, and laboratory test results. During the feature\nextraction stage, we employ e dt h eB G E - M 3s e m a n t i cv e c t o r\nencoding and traditional one-hot vector encoding for comparison.\nFor model training, several wi dely used machine learning\nmodels for binary classi ﬁcation tasks are employed, including\nlogistic regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM),\nLightGBM, XGBoost, and feed-forward neural networks. To\noptimize model performance, we utilized cross-validation and\ngrid search on the training and validation cohort to ﬁne-tune\nmodel parameters and achieve optimal predictive accuracy.\n2.3 Feature extraction\n2.3.1 One-hot vector coding\nOne-hot encoding is a traditional technique used to represent\ncategorical features in machine learning algorithms. Each category\nis converted into a binary featu re for model integration. For\ncontinuous features, outlier handling methods are applied depend\non the distribution of the data. Normal distribution data is\nevaluated using the 3s criterion, while non-normal distribution\ndata uses the interquartile range (IQR) criterion for outlier\nidentiﬁcation. The detected outliers are removed, and missing\nvalues are imputed with the mean to maintain data integrity.\nFIGURE 2\nProcess of developing the risk prediction model for colorectal adenoma.\nYang et al. 10.3389/fonc.2025.1508455\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org04\nFeature scaling is then performed by dividing each value by the\nmaximum absolute value in the feature, standardizing the feature\nvalues within the range of ( –1, 1). This scaling bene ﬁts to\nmodel stability.\nHowever, one-hot encoding can generate high-dimensional\nfeature vectors, especially with our large EMR data, and not all\nfeatures are pertinent to the prediction task. To address this, feature\nselection is crucial to reducing dimensionality, enhancing model\nefﬁciency, and mitigating over ﬁtting. Random Forest, a robust\nmachine learning algorithm, provides an effective feature selection\nmethod. It measures the importance of each feature by assessing its\ncontribution to the reduction of Gini impurity in decision tree nodes.\nFeatures with higher importance scores are retained, streamlining\ndata dimensionality and boosting computational efﬁciency.\n2.3.2 BGE-M3 vector coding\nThe Smart Source General Semantic Vector Model BGE-M3\n(BAAI General Embedding M3), introduced in 2024 (27), offers\nsigni ﬁcant advantages over tradit ional One-Hot Encoding,\nparticularly for analyzing clinical EMR data with diverse semantic\ninformation. BGE-M3 simpli ﬁes preprocessing and effectively\ncaptures insightful semant ic features, enhancing the\nunderstanding of complex clinical report, which is crucial in\nclinical diagnosis. It integrates semantic, syntactic, and knowledge\ngraph data to provide detailed representation of sentence semantics.\nThis comprehensive approach improves the accuracy and richness\nof sentence vectors, addressing the challenge of using complex\nclinical report.\nBGE-M3 incorporates advanced attention mechanisms and\ncontext modeling techniques, dynamically adjusting word\nimportance and capturing contextual information. These features\nimprove the precision of feature vector for representing sentences,\nmaking BGE-M3 effective for extracting meaningful insights from\nclinical report. Additionally, BGE-M3’s optimized structure and\nparameter tuning ensure high computational ef ﬁciency and\nscalability, facilitating rapid and accurate sentence representations\nfor handling large-scale clinical datasets.\n2.4 Model training\nColorectal adenoma risk prediction involves a binary\nclassiﬁcation task. This study evaluates the effectiveness of several\nmachine learning algorithms, including the feedforward neural\nnetwork (FNN) ( 28 ) ,L i g h tG r a d i e n tB o o s t i n gM a c h i n e\n(LightGBM) (29), Logistic Regression (LR) (30), Random Forest\n(RF) (31), Support Vector Machine (SVM) (32), and eXtreme\nGradient Boosting (XGBoost) ( 33). Further details on the\nalgorithms and their implementations can be found in the Section\n2.4 of the Supplementary Material.\nOptimal model parameters were selected through a systematic\nprocess involving grid search andﬁve-fold cross-validation. This\nmethod entailed exploring prede ﬁned parameter ranges and\nrandomly combining parameters across various model algorithms.\nDetailed descriptions of the optimal parameters and their respective\nranges throughout the tuning process are provided in\nSupplementary Table S1of theSupplementary Material.\n2.5 Model evaluation\n2.5.1 Evaluation metrics\nThe performance of the risk prediction model was evaluated\nusing multiple metrics in both the validation cohort and the\nindependent test cohort, including Sensitivity/Recall, Speciﬁcity,\nPositive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV),\nF1-Score, AUC, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)\nanalysis. Detailed description s of the evaluation metrics are\nprovided inSupplementary Table S2of theSupplementary Material.\n2.5.2 Evaluation on the independent test cohort\nWe evaluated the model’s ability to predict colorectal adenoma\nin advance on the independent test cohort. Starting from patient\nadmission, the model predicted risk based on changes in EMR data,\nincluding health status or new laboratory test results. Predictions\ncontinued until a high risk of colorectal adenoma was indicated, and\nsubsequent pathology diagnosis was used to verify the accuracy of\nthe predictions. Successful predictions were de ﬁned as those\nmatching the actual outcomes. To quantify predictive lead time,\nwe computed the average interval between the model’s high-risk\nprediction and the actual diagnosis for successful predictions.\nWe employed Kaplan-Meier analysis to demonstrate the change\nin model-predicted outcomes and clinical actual diagnoses with\nincreasing time of admission. The horizontal coordinate is the time\nof admission, the vertical coordinate survival rate indicates the ratio\nof positive samples remained incorrectly diagnosed, which means\n0% indicates that all positive samples were correctly diagnosed. This\nmethod provides a graphical representation of predictive accuracy\nand effectiveness over time.\n2.6 Model interpretation\nWe utilized the SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) method\nto interpret the relationship between features and model predictions\n(34). SHAP employs an additive feature attribution approach to\ncalculate values for each feature, quantifying both the magnitude\nand direction of their impact on model predictions. The absolute\nvalue of each feature’s SHAP score indicates the degree of inﬂuence\non the model’s predictions. Positive SHAP values suggest support\nfor a higher risk prediction of colorectal adenoma, while negative\nvalues indicate the opposite.

Speci ﬁc\nYang et al. 10.3389/fonc.2025.1508455\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org05\nstatistical methods were select ed based on the distributional\nproperties of the variables. For normally distributed continuous\nvariables, quantitative results are presented as mean ± standard\ndeviation (SD), with signiﬁcance assessed using the t-test. For non-\nnormally distributed continuous variables, the data was reported as\nmedian (Q1, Q3), and differences between groups were evaluated\nusing the Mann-Whitney U test, a non-parametric alternative.\nCategorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test to\ndetermine signiﬁcant differences between categorical levels.\n2.8 Patient and public involvement\nThis study was a retrospective analysis, thus patients were not\ninvolved. We have provided relevant content following the\nTRIPOD reporting guidelines (36).\n3 Results\n3.1 Data distribution of different\ndepartments\nThis study examines the distribution of colorectal adenoma\npatients across various departments at their initial consultation.\nFigure 3illustrates the distribution of the top 8 departments based\non patient numbers. Notably, the gastroenterology department\nexhibits a high prevalence, with approximately 1,200 cases of\ncolorectal adenoma, indicating a signi ﬁcantly higher incidence\ncompared to other departments. Interestingly, the general surgery\ndepartment also demonstrates a substantial proportion of cases,\nsuggesting that colorectal adenoma is prevalent among patients\nseeking care in non-gastroenterology departments. This\nobservation underscores the relevance and potential impact of the\nrisk prediction model proposed in this study. By extending beyond\ngastroenterology, our model ai ms to facilitate screening and\npreventive strategies across multiple departments. Early\nidenti ﬁcation of colorectal adenoma risks can contribute to\nreducing the incidence of colorectal cancer and enhancing\ncomprehensive patient care and safety.\n3.2 Clinical characteristics analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed on the clinical characteristics\nof patients enrolled between 2012 and 2022, as shown inTable 2.\nSince there are so many characteristics in this study, we only present\nthose that are statistically different and clinically important. Within\nthe present characteristics, Cholesterol, Triglycerides and CA19–9\ndid not show statistical differences between groups.\n3.3 Model performance evaluation\nAs shown in Tables 3 , 4,t h eB G E - M 3v e c t o r sa c h i e v e d\nsigniﬁcant improvement compared to One-Hot vectors. Within\nthe models using BGE-M3 vectors, XGBoost obtained the best\nperformance in terms of AUC. As shown inFigure 4, the FNN\nobtain reasonable performance by using BGE-M3. These results\ndemonstrated that the BGE-M3 vectors can show better\nperformance on EMR data encoding than traditional One-\nHot vectors.\n3.4 Independent test cohort validation\nTo assess the model’s generalization ability, this study employed\n2023 data as an independent test cohort for validating the BGE-M3-\nbased XGBoost model, which achieved the highest AUC on test set.\nThe experimental results are summarized inTable 5, these results\nveriﬁed the robust generalization capability of our developed model.\nThis study evaluated the model’s ability to predict colorectal\nadenomas in advance using 431 hospitalized patients out of 482\npositive samples from the independent test cohort. As shown in\nFIGURE 3\nDistribution of patients with colorectal adenoma across departments.\nYang et al. 10.3389/fonc.2025.1508455\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org06\nTable 6, the model achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.9141 for\npositive samples, with an average advance prediction time of 6.88\nhours. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 5, Kaplan-Meier analysis\ndemonstrated that our proposed model predicted the high risk in\nadvances (p<0.05) by an average of 6.88 hours compared to the\nactual clinical diagnosis time and maintained a reasonable accuracy.\n3.5 Assessment of model feature\nimportance\nWe utilized the SHAP method to interpret features ’\ncontribution in the XGBoost model based on one-hot vectors.\nFigure 6 illustrates the top 16 features ranked by SHAP\nimportance, indicating their respective in ﬂuence on model\npredictions. The vertical color gradient inFigure 6 represents the\nmagnitude of each feature ’s SHAP value, with warmer colors\nindicating higher values and cooler colors indicating lower values.\nThe horizontal SHAP values indicate whether each feature\npositively or negatively impacts predictions. Positive SHAP values\nsupport colorectal adenoma predi ctions, while negative values\nsuggest non-colorectal adenoma p redictions. Integrating the\nhorizontal SHAP values with the vertical gradient provides a\ncomprehensive understanding of the direction and strength of\neach feature’si nﬂuence on prediction outcomes.\nFigure 6 highlights the critical role of laboratory items in\ndiagnosing colorectal adenoma, with eight out of the top 16\nfeatures belonging to this category. Notably, Lipoprotein A\nemerges as the most inﬂuential predictive feature. Additionally,\nsymptomatic features prominently appear among the top 16,\nunderscoring the importance of unstructured clinical EMR data\nin predictive modeling.\nTABLE 2 Statistical analysis of clinical characteristics.\nFeature name Total sample\nsize (N=92,681)\nNon-colorectal adenoma\ngroup (N=90,212)\nColorectal adenoma\ngroup (N=2,469)\nP-value\nDemographic characteristics\nAge, mean(SD) 49.1 (15.7) 48.8 (15.7) 59.4 (14.7) <0.05\nMale, n (%) 42765 (46.1) 41407 (45.9) 1358 (55.0) <0.05\nSigns and symptoms\nBlood in stool, n (%) 5155 (5.6) 4691 (5.2) 464 (18.8) <0.05\nNausea, n (%) 7692 (8.3) 7578 (8.4) 114 (4.6) <0.05\nAbdominal pain, n (%) 12876 (13.9) 12449 (13.8) 427 (17.3) <0.05\nStool abnormalities, n (%) 32319 (34.9) 31304 (34.7) 1015 (41.1) <0.05\nfamily history\nColon cancer, n (%) 583 (0.6) 541 (0.6) 42 (1.7) <0.05\nColon polyps, n (%) 4465 (4.8) 4060 (4.5) 405 (16.4) <0.05\nHypertension, n (%) 9108 (9.8) 8570 (9.5) 538 (21.8) <0.05\nDiabetes, n (%) 4006 (4.3) 3789 (4.2) 217 (8.8) <0.05\nInspection Indicators\nHemoglobin (g/L, mean(SD)) 140.8 (15.7) 140.9 (15.7) 136.9 (16.6) <0.05\nFecal occult blood test, n (%) 3817 (4.1) 3518 (3.9) 299 (12.1) <0.05\nCholesterol(mmol/L, mean(SD)) 4.6 (1.0) 4.6 (1.0) 4.6 (1.0) 0.362\nTriglycerides(mmol/L, mean(SD)) 1.3 (0.6) 1.3 (0.6) 1.3 (0.6) 0.094\nLipoprotein A (mg/L, Median [Q1,Q3]) 90.0 [43.0,182.0] 86.0 [41.0,176.0] 103.5 [47.0,196.2] <0.05\nSerum uric acid (umol/L,mean(SD)) 312.1 (83.3) 312.5 (83.2) 303.2 (86.1) <0.05\nCreatinine(umol/L, mean(SD)) 76.1 (14.2) 76.2 (14.1) 73.7 (15.4) <0.05\nGlycosylated hemoglobin (%, mean(SD)) 5.8 (0.5) 5.8 (0.5) 5.9 (0.5) <0.05\nCEA (ng/ml, mean(SD)) 2.0 (1.1) 2.0 (1.1) 2.2 (1.2) <0.05\nCA19-9 (IU/L, mean(SD)) 10.6 (7.1) 10.6 (7.2) 10.9 (6.9) 0.158\nYang et al. 10.3389/fonc.2025.1508455\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org07\n4 Discussion\nThis study successfully develo ped a highly accurate and\ngeneralizable risk prediction model for colorectal adenoma\nleveraging the strengths of LLM and comprehensive EMR data,\nproviding a robust scientiﬁc foundation for early detection and\nintervention strategies. Furthermore, this study analyzed extensive\nclinical EMR of patients with colorectal adenoma, revealing distinct\ncharacteristics compared to non-colorectal adenoma patients.\nRetrospective statistical analysis ( Table 2 )o ft h ed a t a s e t\nidenti ﬁed typical clinical features associated with colorectal\nadenoma, including higher average age and male predominance,\nconsistent with prior research (37–39). Symptoms such as blood in\nstool, abdominal pain, and stool abnormalities were prevalent\namong colorectal adenoma patient s. Interestingly, nausea, less\ncommonly associated with colo rectal adenoma, exhibited\nsigniﬁcant inter-group differences, possibly reﬂecting variations in\ndata collection across healthcare providers ( 40). Comorbidity\nanalysis revealed signiﬁcant associations with colon cancer, colon\npolyps, hypertension, and family history of diabetes mellitus,\naligning with existing literature ( 41–44). The analysis also\nhighlighted variations in biomarkers including hemoglobin, fecal\noccult blood test, lipoprotein A, serum uric acid, creatinine, glycated\nhemoglobin, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ( 45–49),\nunderscoring their relevance in predicting colorectal adenoma risk.\nThe comparison (Table 3, 4) between BGE-M3 and one-hot\nvector coding demonstrated the superior performance of BGE-M3\ndense representation, dimensional reduction, semantic information\ncapture, context sensitivity, and adaptive learning. This enhanced\nthe model’s ability to handle complex clinical EMR data, resulting in\nimproved performance across various machine learning algorithms.\nXGBoost emerged as the top performer, demonstrating robust\nsensitivity and AUC values of 0.9251, 0.9413, and 0.9847,\nrespectively, leveraging advantages in boosting framework, feature\nengineering, regularization, pruning, and parallel computing (33).\nThe model’s generalizability was validated on an independent\ntest cohort (Table 5), utilizing the BGE-M3 semantic vector model\nand diverse data sources from several departments (Figure 3)( 50).\nOur model facilitated earlier de tection of colorectal adenoma\n(Table 5, Figure 5), providing a potential opportunity to optimize\nclinical workﬂows and improve patient outcomes. SHAP analysis\n(Figure 6) identiﬁed key predictors such as age, symptoms, family\nhistory, biomarkers, and cardiovascular risk factors (51). Notably,\nexamination-related features did not appear in the TOP16 list,\nwhich may be attributed to two factors: (1) The study focused on\nearly-stage prediction of colorectal adenomas in patients with subtle\nsymptoms that might not manifest distinctly in imaging data; (2) To\nensure objectivity, the research protocol speci ﬁcally excluded\nexamination methods directly associated with pathological\ncon ﬁrmation (including but not limited to colonoscopy,\nTABLE 4 Performance of different models using BGE-M3 vectors on the test set of training cohort.\nModel Sensitivity\n(mean ± std)\nSpeciﬁcity\n(mean ± std)\nPPV\n(mean ± std)\nNPV\n(mean ± std)\nF1-score\n(mean ± std)\nAUC\n(mean ± std)\nFNN 0.7895 ± 0.0455 0.9972 ± 0.0101 0.8864 ± 0.0217 0.9943 ± 0.0013 0.8351 ± 0.0199 0.9822 ± 0.0104\nLightGBM 0.8603 ± 0.0104 0.9794 ± 0.0011 0.5339 ± 0.0018 0.9961 ± 0.0003 0.6589 ± 0.0021 0.9843 ± 0.0043\nLR 0.9130 ± 0.0135 0.9101 ± 0.0033 0.2176 ± 0.0024 0.9974 ± 0.0004 0.3514 ± 0.0034 0.9716 ± 0.0025\nRF 0.8603 ± 0.0219 0.9296 ± 0.0028 0.2507 ± 0.0042 0.9959 ± 0.0007 0.3883 ± 0.0069 0.9600 ± 0.0090\nSVM 0.8927 ± 0.0113 0.9450 ± 0.0024 0.3077 ± 0.0026 0.9969 ± 0.0004 0.4577 ± 0.0040 0.9786 ± 0.0014\nXGBoost 0.9251 ± 0.0047 0.9413 ± 0.0018 0.3015 ± 0.0074 0.9978 ± 0.0002 0.4547 ± 0.0079 0.9847 ± 0.0038\nTABLE 3 Performance of different models using one-hot vectors on the test set of training cohort.\nModel Sensitivity\n(mean ± std)\nSpeciﬁcity\n(mean ± std)\nPPV\n(mean ± std)\nNPV\n(mean ± std)\nF1-score\n(mean ± std)\nAUC\n(mean ± std)\nFNN 0.8023 ± 0.0270 0.7796 ± 0.0293 0.0935 ± 0.0095 0.9929 ± 0.0008 0.1676 ± 0.0149 0.8641 ± 0.0118\nLightGBM 0.7652 ± 0.0160 0.8799 ± 0.0036 0.1530 ± 0.0064 0.9925 ± 0.0005 0.2550 ± 0.0097 0.9052 ± 0.0067\nLR 0.7573 ± 0.0161 0.8714 ± 0.0029 0.1430 ± 0.0033 0.9922 ± 0.0005 0.2406 ± 0.0052 0.8943 ± 0.0104\nRF 0.7945 ± 0.0477 0.8094 ± 0.0182 0.1057 ± 0.0053 0.9929 ± 0.0013 0.1865 ± 0.0066 0.8783 ± 0.0085\nSVM 0.7867 ± 0.0079 0.8659 ± 0.0042 0.1426 ± 0.0044 0.9931 ± 0.0003 0.2414 ± 0.0066 0.9104 ± 0.0090\nXGBoost 0.7867 ± 0.0142 0.8623 ± 0.0028 0.1393 ± 0.0042 0.9930 ± 0.0004 0.2367 ± 0.0067 0.9092 ± 0.0064\nYang et al. 10.3389/fonc.2025.1508455\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org08\nhistopathological analysis, and tissue biopsy). This lack of\nsigniﬁcant contribution from imaging features compared to other\npredictors could therefore be explained by the inherent limitations\nof early disease detection and the deliberate exclusion of gold-\nstandard diagnostic procedures.\nOur exclusion of patients with a history of colectomy or\nconditions potentially affecting in ﬂammation assessment is\nmethodologically appropriate and preserves the generalizability of\nthe model within its intended screening population. These\nindividuals are excluded because their underlying conditions (e.g.,\npost-colectomy anatomical alterations, in ﬂammatory\ncomorbidities) may confound adenoma-speci ﬁcb i o m a r k e r\nproﬁles critical for early-stage colorectal cancer screening (52–55).\nThis exclusion aligns with standard clinical practice, where such\npatients are typically diverted from routine adenoma screening\nprotocols and instead undergo dedicated surveillance pathways\ntailored to their speciﬁc risk proﬁles (56–58). Consequently, the\nexclusion criteria do not compromise the model’s applicability to its\ntarget population — asymptomatic individuals eligible for\nprimary screening.\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this\nstudy, which do not affect the conclusions of this study. Firstly, the\nsingle-center nature of the study may limit the generalizability of\nthe results to diverse healthcare settings. While multi-center\nvalidation was precluded by privacy regulations governing EMR\nsharing, we implemented prospective temporal validation (isolated\nTABLE 5 Results on the independent test cohort of the XGBoost model with the BGE-M3 vectors.\nModel Sensitivity Speci ﬁcity PPV NPV F1-score AUC\nXGBoost 0.9253 0.9519 0.3306 0.9980 0.4872 0.9839\nFIGURE 4\nRadar plot and ROC curve of different models’ performance on the test set of the training cohort.\nTABLE 6 Average model prediction lead time.\nModel Correct predictions Incorrect predictions Predictive accuracy Average advance prediction time (h)\nXGBoost 394 37 0.9141 6.88\nYang et al. 10.3389/fonc.2025.1508455\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org09\n2023 test cohort) to approximate external generalizability, ensuring\nno data leakage between training (2012–2022) and testing phases.\nSecondly, the retrospective d esign does not allow for direct\nassessment of the model ’s impact on clinical practice. Future\nresearch should focus on integ rating the model into clinical\nsupport systems for prospective validation.\nFurthermore, practical challenges persist in translating this\nmodel into clinical practice: (1) Work ﬂow Integration\nFramework: To operationalize the 6.88-hour predictive lead time,\na dual-phase implementation strategy is proposed. First,\nstandardized application progr amming interfaces (APIs) will\nbridge heterogeneous EMR system s, generating context-aware\nalerts (e.g., prioritized taskﬂags or pop-up notiﬁcations) for high-\nrisk patients. Second, an interpretable clinician dashboard will\ndynamically display risk strati ﬁcation, highlighting SHAP-\nidenti ﬁed predictors (e.g., lipo protein A >100 mg/L) and\nevidence-based escala tion protocols (e.g., “urgent colonoscopy\n≤48 hours”) to align with clinical workﬂows without imposing\ncognitive burdens. (2) Strategic Value of Temporal Advantage: The\n6.88-hour window holds distinct clinical implications across care\nsettings. In acute care, it enables time-sensitive interventions (e.g.,\naccelerating endoscopic evaluation for occult bleeding), mitigating\nrisks of obstruction or hemorrhagic complications. For ambulatory\ncare, it streamlines triage prioritization, reducing diagnostic latency\nthrough early risk stratiﬁcation. (3) Adoption Barrier Mitigation:\nTo overcome implementation in ertia, three evidence-driven\nsolutions are prioritized: (i) Prospective multicenter trials\nevaluating clinical endpoints (adenoma detection rate, interval-to-\ndiagnosis); (ii) Adaptive alert thresholds informed by clinician\nfeedback (e.g., muting redundant alerts for patients under\ndiagnostic workup); (iii) Privacy- preserving federated learning\narchitectures to enhance cross-in stitutional generalizability.\nStandardized validation protocols are being ﬁnalized to ensure\ntranslational ﬁdelity across diverse healthcare ecosystems.\n5 Conclusion\nThis study presents a novel approach to colorectal adenoma risk\nprediction leveraging clinical EMR data and LLM. The proposed\nmodel demonstrates superior performance in identifying high-risk\nindividuals, providing a valuable tool for early screening. By\nleveraging the BGE-M3 semantic vector model, the algorithm\nenhances data comprehension and captures nuanced semantic\ninformation. With an average lead time of 6.88 hours and\noutstanding classi ﬁcation performance, the model has the\npotential to revolutionize clinical work ﬂows and improve\npatient care.\nFIGURE 5\nKaplan-Meier analysis of the developed model and clinical actual\ndiagnosis for evaluating the prediction time in advance.\nFIGURE 6\nContribution and directional inﬂuence of top 16 features on XGBoost Model predictions using SHAP analysis.\nYang et al. 10.3389/fonc.2025.1508455\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org10\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\nin the article/Supplementary Material.
