    "abstract": "Software systems are often maintained by a group of experienced software developers in order to ensure that faults that may bring the system down are less likely. Large turnover in organizations such as CERN makes it important to think of ways of onboarding newcomers on a technical project rapidly. This paper focuses on optimizing the way that people get up-to-speed on the business logic and technologies used on the project by using a knowledge-imbued large language model that is enhanced using domain-specific knowledge from the group or team’s internal documentation. The novelty of this approach is the gathering of all of these different open-source methods for developing a chatbot and using it in an industrial use-case.",
