PLoS ONE 2(11): e1239. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001239\nINTRODUCTION\nPerpetuation by sexual reproduction is the rule within the animal\nKingdom. A plethora of sex determination mechanisms exist\nwhich commit the embryo to following either the male or female\ndevelopmental pathway. The mechanism underlying this process\nhas been thoroughly analysed in Drosophila melanogaster . In this\nspecies, sex determination is under the control of the gene Sex lethal\n(Sxl). The epistatic relationships between Sxl and the other sex\ndetermination genes transformer (tra), transformer-2 (tra-2)and doublesex\n(dsx) have revealed a hierarchical interaction to exist among them.\nTheir characterisation has shown that the sex-specific splicing of\ntheir primary transcripts controls their expression during develop-\nment, the product of one gene controlling the sex-specific splicing of\nthe pre-mRNA of the downstream gene in the sex determination\ncascade (reviewed in [1]).\nThe gene Sxl, which is at the top of this cascade, acts as the\nmemory device for female sexual development via its auto-regulatory\nfunction: the Sxl protein participates in the female-specific splicing of\nits own pre-mRNA [2,3]. The downstream target of Sxl is the gene\ntransformer (tra). A transcript found in both males and females encodes\na non-functional truncated Tra protein, and a female-specific\ntranscript encodes the functional Tra protein [4,5,6,7,8]. The Tra\nproduct and the product of the constitutive gene transformer-2 (tra-2)\n[9,10] control the sex-specific splicing of the pre-mRNA of the gene\ndoublesex (dsx), the last gene in the genetic cascade, and which is\ntranscribed in both sexes [11,12,13,14,15,16]. In females, the Tra-\nTra2 complex directs the splicing of thedsx pre-mRNA according to\nthe female mode, giving rise to the female DsxF protein that\npromotes female sexual development. In males, where no functional\nTra protein is available, thedsx pre-mRNA follows the default, male\nmode of splicing, which produces male DsxM protein. This\npromotes male sexual development.\nSex determination mechanisms have long been of major interest\nfrom both developmental and evolutionary points of view. The\nsearch in different insects for genes homologous to the sex\ndetermination genes of D. melanogaster is underway. The aim is to\ndetermine how much of the sex determination genetic cascade has\nbeen modified between the more ancient dipteran phylogenetic\nlineages and the drosophilid lineage. The gene tra of Drosophila\nsimulans, D. erecta, D. hydeiand D. virilis has been characterised [17]\nand an unusually high degree of divergence found with that of D.\nAcademic Editor: Jean-Nicolas Volff, Ecole Normale Supe ´rieure de Lyon, France\nReceived September 11, 2007; Accepted October 26, 2007; Published November\n28, 2007\nCopyright: /C2232007 Ruiz et al.

Even so, D. melanogaster tra mutants can all be rescued\nby the tra of these species [17].\nOutside the genus Drosophila, tra was first characterised in Ceratitis\ncapitata [18] and recently in Bactrocera oleae [19]. As in Drosophila,i n\nCeratitis and Bactrocera alternative splicing also regulates the\nexpression of tra so that only females contain the full-length protein.\nThe Ceratitis capitata (Cctra)and Bactrocera oleae (Botra) tragenes have\nmale-specific exons, which contain translation stop codons; their\ninclusion in the mature mRNA produces truncated and most\nprobably non-functional Tra protein. In females, these exons are\nspliced out, and a mature mRNA is made that produces a functional\nTra protein. Surprisingly, putative Tra-Tra2 binding sites have been\nfound in the male-specific exons of Cctra [18] and Botra [19]. The\ninjection of the respectivetra-dsRNA in Ceratitis [20] and inBactrocera\n[19] results in the destruction of endogenous tra function in both\nspecies and the subsequent male-specific splicing of the endogenous\ntra pre-mRNA, ensuing in the complete transformation of females\ninto fertile XX pseudomales.\nThe early results in Ceratitis led to Pane et al. [18] to propose\na novel auto-regulatory function for the Cctra gene with respect to\nits Drosophila homologue. In C. capitata, the gene tra would play the\nkey regulatory role, acting as the memory device for sex\ndetermination through its auto-regulatory function. The Tra\nprotein would act as a splicing inhibitor of its own pre-mRNA\nsplicing. This was based on the idea that the Tra-Tra2 complex\nbinds to the Tra-Tra2 binding sites in the tra pre-mRNA2because\nof the sequence conservation of these sites 2inhibiting the\nincorporation of the male-specific exons into the mature tra\nmRNA. This would also apply to the gene tra of B. oleae [19].\nTo better analyse the evolution of tra gene, in the present work\nits characterisation was undertaken in tephritid species belonging\nto the less extensively analysed genus Anastrepha. We chose those\nspecies which, according to morphological [21] and molecular\ndata [22], belong to distinct intrageneric taxonomic groups. The\npresent analysis therefore included Anastrepha obliqua, A. ludens, A.\namita and A. sororcula, plus the four closely related species of the so-\ncalled Anastrepha fraterculus complex2A. sp.1 aff. fraterculus, A. sp.2\naff. fraterculus, A.\nsp.3 aff. fraterculus and A. sp.4 aff. fraterculus [23,24],\nall of which belong to the fraterculus group [21]–along with A.\nserpentina, A. striata and A. bistrigata (of the serpentina group, see 25])\nand A. grandis (of the grandis group).\nThe gene tra in the reference species A. obliqua was first isolated\nand its molecular organisation, expression pattern and encoded\nproduct studied. The tra ORFs in the other Anastrepha species were\nthen identified, and a comparative analysis of all the known insect\nTra proteins undertaken. In this way, a comparison of the Tra\nprotein at different phylogenetic levels was made. Within-genus\ncomparisons of the members of Drosophila and Anastrepha;d i s t i n c t\ngenera of the same family, such as Ceratitis, Bactroceraand Anastrepha\n(Tephritidae); and two different families of the same order (Diptera),\nsuch as Drosophilidae and Tephritidae. Next, the genomictra region\nthat controls the sex-specific splicing of its primary transcript was\ncharacterised and compared in C. capitata, B. oleae and the above\nAnastrepha species. This should indicate whether the molecular\norganisation of gene tra in Ceratitis and in Bactrocera arose before or\nafter the splitting off of the frugivorous Tephritidae lineage. Finally,\nthe phylogeny of gene tra in these different insects was investigated.\nRESULTS\nThe molecular organisation oftra in Anastrepha\nobliqua, and its product\nThe strategy followed to determine the molecular organisation of\nAnastrepha obliqua tragene(Aotra)is described in Materials and Methods.\nFigures 1A and B shows the molecular organisation of the Aotra\ngene. The transcription unit is made up of 7665 bp, and the\ntranscription start site located at –197 bp from the initial ATG of\nthe ORF. It is composed of 4 exons (1–4) common to both sexes,\nand three male-specific exons, ms1, ms2 and ms3, located between\nexons 1 and 2. The Aotra gene produces three mRNAs in females\nformed by exons 1–4. These differ in the length of their 3 9UTR,\nyet they encode the same female Tra protein. In males, 5 distinct\nmRNAs (M1–M5) are produced depending on the male-specific\nexons included (see Fig. 1B). These latter exons contain translation\nstop codons. The comparison of male and female Aotra mRNAs\nindicates that they arise by sex-specific splicing of the tra pre-\nmRNA, with the male-specific exons being skipped in the female\nmRNA.\nFigure 1A compares the molecular organisation of Aotra, Cctra\nand Botra. In all three cases the female mRNA contains 4 exons.\nExons 2–4 are homologous across all three species, their sizes\ndiffering only slightly. Exon 1 of Aotra corresponds to exon 1 of\nCctra and to exons 1A and 1B of Botra.I n Cctra and Aotra, exons 1\nand ms1 are contiguous. However, in Botra, exon 1 is split and\nexon 1A precedes and is contiguous with ms1. Both are separated\nby an intron from the downstream exon 1B with which exon ms2\nis contiguous. This latter exon is flanked by introns in Aotra and\nCctra. Both Botra and Aotra have an additional male-specific exon,\nms3.\nThe conceptual translation of the female Aotra mRNA shows it\nto encode a polypeptide of 417 amino acids. Male Aotra mRNA,\nhowever, encodes a truncated, presumably non-functional poly-\npeptide of either 55 or 67 amino acids depending on the male-\nspecific splicing pathway followed (see Fig. 1B). The female Tra\nprotein contains the SR dipeptides that characterise the family of\nSR proteins.\nIn D. melanogaster [26]], in other drosophilids [17], in C. capitata\n[18] and in B. oleae [19], the gene tra is closely linked to the well-\nconserved gene l(3)73Ah. In the three named species, these two\ngenes are transcribed in opposite directions, and in D. melanogaster\nand C. capitata the genes tra and l(3)73Ah overlap at their 3 9-UTR\nregions. In B. oleae such overlapping seems not to be present and\nthe stop codons of both genes are 830 bp from each other. In A.\nobliqua the genes tra and l(3)73Ah do not overlap either, and are\nseparated by about 3.5 kb (data not shown).\nThe expression oftra in A. obliqua\nThe expression of Aotra was studied by performing RT-PCR on\ntotal RNA from adult males and females, on RNA from the heads\nplus thoraces of male and female A. obliqua adults (separately), on\nthat from a mixture of male plus female larvae at different\ndevelopmental stages, and that from adult ovaries. Figure 2 shows\nthe primers used. All the amplified fragments were cloned and\nsequenced. The primer pair Ao26 plus Ao25 amplified a fragment\nof 904 bp common to both sexes, while Ao41 plus Ao44 amplified\na single fragment of 154 bp in adult female soma and ovaries, as\nwell as two fragments of 154 and 368 bp in the larvae\n(corresponding to female and male mRNAs respectively). Different\nfragments were amplified in adult male soma depending on the\nmale-specific exons they included (these latter fragments could not\nbe resolved in gels).\nThe gene tra is transcribed in both sexes to produce two\ndifferent spliced mRNAs 2one in each sex 2during development\nand adult life. In females, the mRNA encoding the full-length Tra\nprotein is produced, whereas in males mRNA encoding a truncat-\ned, non-functional Tra protein is made. Importantly, tra is also\nexpressed in the ovaries where it produces female mRNA. This\nAnastrepha Gene Transformer\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2007 | Issue 11 | e1239\nindicates that, as in C. capitataand B. oleae, the mother provides the\nzygote with female tra mRNA and/or female Tra protein.\nThe Tra protein of otherAnastrepha species\nThe strategy followed to identify the tra ORFs in the other\nAnastrepha species is explained in Materials and Methods. The\nputative Tra proteins from the 12 Anastrepha species and the Tra\nprotein from C. capitata, B. oleaeand A. obliqua(used as reference for\nthe genus Anastrepha) were then compared.\nThe Tra protein of the 12 Anastrepha species is composed of 417\namino acids, except that of A. grandis, which contains 416 amino\nacids (Fig. S1 in Supporting material). Their degree of similarity\n(i.e., identical plus conservative amino acids) ranges from 88 to\n99% (upper half of Table 1). The Tra protein of the tephritids is\nlarger than that of the drosophilids due to its bigger amino\nterminal end. This is composed of about 103 amino acids in the\nAnastrepha species and of 105 amino acids in Ceratitis and Bactrocera.\nThe comparison of the specific amino-terminal region in all\nAnastrepha species revealed an extraordinary high degree of\nsimilarity (between 89–100%) (lower half of Table 1).\nTable 2 and Fig. 3 compare the Tra protein of the tephritids C.\ncapitata, B. oleae and A. obliqua (the reference for the genus\nAnastrepha). They differed slightly in the number of amino acids\nand the degree of similarity ranged between 54 and 56% (upper\nhalf of Table 2). A similar degree of conservation was seen when\nthe specific amino-terminal region of the tephritid Tra protein\nwere compared among the tephritid species (lower half of Table 2).\nIn Fig. 3, the most conserved regions are shaded. Notice the two\nlarge domains in the amino-terminal end. Finally, the Tra proteins\nof the three tephritids Anastrepha, Ceratitis and Bactrocera contain SR\nFigure 1.

These\nSR dipeptides are also found in the specific amino terminal region\nof the three tephritids.\nMolecular organisation of the sex-specific splicing\nregulatory region oftra\nThe Tra protein acts as a splicing activator in the female-specific\nsplicing of dsx pre-mRNA in C. capitata [18] and B. oleae [19]. In\nthese species, the sex-specific splicing of dsx pre-mRNA is\norganised as in Drosophila: the male-splicing pathway represents\nthe default mode, and the presence of functional Tra protein in\nfemales seems to cause the formation of the Tra-Tra2 complex,\nwhich binds to its targets in the female-specific exon, thus\npromoting the inclusion of the latter in the mature mRNA\n[11,12,13,14,15,16]. The RBP1 being also needed [27]. The\npresence of Tra-Tra2 binding sites in the female-specific exon of\ndsx pre-mRNA of the Anastrepha species suggests that, in these\nspecies, Tra probably also controls the sex-specific splicing of dsx\npre-mRNA [28,29].\nThe auto-regulation model proposed by Pane et al. [18] for C.\ncapitata tra consider that the Tra protein acts as a splicing inhibitor\nof its own pre-mRNA splicing (see Introduction). A similar model\nseems to be applicable to the other tephritids Bactrocera [19] and\nAnastrepha [this work] tra genes, since the molecular organisation of\ntra pre-mRNA of these tephritids were similar to that of Ceratitis.\nNothing is presently known about the mechanism through which\nthe tephritid Tra protein controls the splicing of its own transcript.\nWe undertook a comparison of the tra genomic region (encom-\npassing the male-specific exons and their flanking introns, where\nthe regulation of sex-specific splicing occurs) of the twelve\nAnastrepha species studied here, of C. capitata, and of B. oleae. Given\nthe possible involvement of Tra2 in the auto-regulation of tra,w e\nalso looked for the presence and location of putative Tra-Tra2 and\nRBP1 binding sites, as well as Tra2-ISS binding sites [30], in this\ntra genomic region. The tra genomic region corresponding to the\nAnastrepha species was amplified by PCR processing of genomic\nDNA using the primer pair TRA39 and TRA41 (see Materials\nand Methods and Table S1 in Supporting material).\nIn the Anastrepha species, the size of intron is1 varied between\n1024 and 3296 bp, and that of is2 between 337 and 472 bp. Intron\nis3 was composed of 85 bp in all twelve species (Fig. S2 in\nSupporting Material). Six putative Tra-Tra2 binding sites were\nfound in all the Anastrepha species except for A. striata and A.\nbistrigata, which had five sites (Fig. 4). These elements were located\nat similar positions: two sites in exon ms1, one site in intron is1\n(missing in A. striata and A. bistrigata), and three sites in exon ms3.\nFigure 3.

The\ndifferent groups defined by the tree were very well supported by\nstatistical tests (CP and BS).

In the Anastrepha branch, species of the more ancient\nintrageneric taxonomic groups, such as A. serpentina, A. grandisand\nA. bistrigata (but not A. striata), lie in sub-branches distinct from\nthose grouping the eight species belonging to the fraterculus\ntaxonomic group.\nTable 3 provides information showing the variation of the tra\ngene. Within the pool of three tephritid genera ( Anastrepha, Ceratitis\nand Bactrocera species), the degree of amino acid variation is\nsignificantly smaller than that seen within the genus Drosophila.\nWhen variation of the Tra protein within the genus Anastrepha was\nevaluated, a still more reduced degree of Tra protein variation was\nfound. The observed levels of protein variation agreed well with\nthose observed at the nucleotide level, finding high levels of silent\nvariation.\nThe Tra protein belongs to the family of SR-proteins. These are\ncharacterised by having serine-arginine (SR) dipeptides, which are\ninvolved in protein–protein interactions (reviewed in [32]). The\npercentage of SR dipeptides in the different species was determined,\nand means of 7.072% for the Anastrepha species and 5.644% for the\nother tephritid speciesC. capitataand B. oleaerecorded. These values\nare low compared to the estimated 16.5% in Drosophila species [17].\nFigure 5B shows the proportion of nucleotide sites at which two\nsequences being compared are different (p) against the ratio between\nthe numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide\nsubstitutions per site ( pN/pS). The results show a high degree of\ncoincidence between peaks of p and those of pN/pS, matching the\ngene regions encoding the SR domains, indicating a higher degree of\nnucleotide diversity in these particular areas.\nDISCUSSION\nSex determination in tephritid flies: the role of the\ntra gene\nThe present work shows that the gene tra of the Anastrepha species\nhas a molecular organisation and expression pattern similar to\nthose of Ceratitis [18] and Bactrocera [19]. The hypothesis of Pane et\nal. [18] regarding the role played by tra in Ceratitis sex\ndetermination2namely that of the memory device for sex\ndetermination through its auto-regulatory function–therefore\napplies not only to Bactrocera [19] but also to the Anastrepha species\n(this work), in which females are XX and males are XY. This\nhypothesis states that the Tra protein, together with the Tra2\nprotein, participate in the female-specific splicing of its own\nprimary transcript. The maternal expression of tra would supply tra\nmRNA (or its protein) to the oocyte, thus making it available to the\nembryo. This would impose female-specific splicing on the initial\nzygotic tra pre-mRNA, which would give rise to the initial zygotic\nfunctional Tra protein and consequently the establishment of tra\nauto-regulation. Thus, XX embryos follow the female develop-\nmental route. However, XY embryos are able to follow the male\nroute. For example, in male embryos of C. capitata it is known that\nthe Y chromosome contains a male-determining factor (M factor)\n[33] that would prevent the instigation of tra auto-regulation.\nConsequently, these embryos would not produce functional Tra\nprotein, leading to male development. In Bactrocera and Anastrepha it\nis still not known whether the Y chromosome is male-determining.\nHowever, the similar molecular organisation and expression\npattern of tra in Ceratitis [18], Bactrocera [19] and Anastrepha (this\nwork) suggest that the tra memory device mechanism, as well as the\nM factor mechanism for preventing the establishment of tra auto-\nregulation, might be present in all three of these extant genera,\nand that they may have been present in the common ancestor of\nthe frugivorous Tephritidae lineages.\nThese results support the model of Wilkins [34], who proposed\nthat the evolution of sex-determining cascades was bottom up,\nwith the genes at the bottom being more conserved than those\nfurther upstream genes (for a theoretical analysis of this model see\n[35]). Indeed, the tra/tra2.dsx elements at the bottom of the\ncascade, and their relationships, have been found conserved in all\nthe dipterans analysed so far. This suggests that they represent the\nancestral state (which still exists in the Tephritidae and Muscidae\nlineages) with respect to the extant cascade found in the more\nevolved Drosophilidae lineage (in which tra is just another\ncomponent of the sex determination gene cascade regulated by\nSxl). Thus, in the phylogenetic lineage that gave rise to the\ndrosophilids, evolution co-opted for the Sxl gene, modified it, and\nconverted it into the key gene controlling sex determination, thus\nsubstituting for the loss of tra auto-regulation.\nThe gene tra controls sex determination in the\ntephritid insects through a dual mechanism\nThe Tra protein in the tephritids Ceratitis, Bactrocera and Anastrepha\nappears to show a dual splicing role. On one hand it behaves as\na splicing activator of dsx pre-mRNA2the binding of Tra to the\nfemale-specific exon promotes the inclusion of this exon into the\nmature mRNA. On the other hand, Tra acts as a splicing inhibitor\nof its own pre-mRNA 2the binding of Tra to the male-specific\nexons prevents the inclusion of these exons into the mature\nmRNA. These observations raise the question of how Tra can\nperform this dual function. In this respect, the results obtained by\nother authors [30] with respect to Drosophila Tra2 and RBP1\nfunction are pertinent here. The Drosophila Tra2 protein shows\na dual splicing role. It behaves as a splicing activator of dsx pre-\nmRNA in the soma of Drosophila females, but also acts as a splicing\ninhibitor of the M1 intron in tra-2 pre-mRNA in the germ line of\nDrosophila males. This inhibition is exerted through the binding of\nTra2 to specific ISS sites. However, the in vitrointeraction between\nTra2 and its ISS targets is not sufficient to cause M1 splicing\ninhibition; the presence of nuclear extracts is also required,\nTable 3.

This factor cannot be the Tra protein\nbecause this is not produced in Drosophila males (see Introduction).\nThe RBP1 protein is also required for splicing inhibition of intron\nM1[30] in addition to being required for promoting the splicing of\nthe female-specific exon of dsx pre-mRNA [27]. Thus, the dual\nrole of Tra protein in the tephritids appears to parallel that of Tra2\nand RBP1.\nThis prompted us to look for Tra2 ISS and RBP1 binding sites in\nthe tra genomic region, which controls the sex-specific splicing of its\nprimary transcript inC. capitata, B. oleaeand the Anastrepha species. In\naddition to the previously described putative Tra-Tra2 binding\nsequences, putative Tra2-ISS and RBP1binding sites were found–an\nimportant discovery. These sequences are highly conserved in the\ntephritids and in Drosophila. Moreover, RBP1 2but not Tra2-\nISS2binding sites was found in the region of Anastrepha, Ceratitis\nand Bactrocera dsx pre-mRNA involved in sex-specific splicing\nregulation (data not shown). It is suggested here that the Tra2-ISS\nbinding sites provide a discriminative feature for thetra and dsx pre-\nmRNAs regions involved in sex-specific splicing regulation.\nQuestions naturally arise regarding the molecular basis un-\nderlying the putative dual splicing role of the tephritid Tra protein.\nThe presence and molecular organisation of Tra-Tra2 and RBP1\nbinding sites in the dsx gene of tephritid flies 2which is similar to\nthat seen in Drosophila2suggests that Tra, Tra2 and RBP1 bind co-\noperatively to form a splicing activator complex at the female-\nspecific exon of dsx pre-mRNA. This would allow the exon to be\nincorporated into the mature mRNA. The tephritid tra pre-mRNA\nalso contains Tra-Tra2 and RBP1 binding sites so that the Tra-\nTra2-RBP1 complex can bind the male-specific exons 2but in this\ncase it would prevent the incorporation of these exons into the\nmature tra mRNA. It is proposed here that this is so because the\npresence of Tra2-ISS binding sites in the tra pre-mRNA\ndetermines the additional binding of Tra2 to these sequences,\nand that this overrides the activator effect of the Tra-Tra2-RBP1\ncomplex.\nAs mentioned above, the interaction of Tra2 with the ISS sites\nin Drosophila tra-2 pre-mRNA requires an as yet unknown factor.\nThus, it is possible that such a factor is also required for the\ninteraction of Tra-2 at the ISS sites in tephritid tra pre-mRNA,\nand that the complex formed by Tra2 and the proposed factor\nblocks, either by itself or by recruiting another SR protein, the\nsplicing activation effect of the Tra-Tra2-RBP1 complex. While in\nDrosophila the Tra protein cannot be this unknown factor, it cannot\nbe ruled out that this is not the case in the tephritids. The tephritid\nTra protein has an amino terminal region not found in the\nDrosophila Tra protein. This region is very strongly conserved\namong the tephritid Ceratitis, Bactrocera and Anastrepha species. In\naddition it contains SR-dipeptides involved in protein-protein\ninteractions. Thus, the possibility exists that the tephritid Tra\nprotein has a double interaction with the Tra2 protein\n2one\nmediated through the region of the protein homologous in the\ntephritids and drosophilids, and a second through the specific\namino terminal region associated with the binding of Tra2 to ISS\nsites. This second interaction would convert the Tra-Tra2-RBP1\nsplicing activator complex into a Tra2-Tra-Tra2-RBP1 splicing\ninhibitor complex. Alternatively, the double interaction of Tra and\nTra2 may recruit an SR protein, which would inhibit splicing. In\nFigure 6. Proposed explanation of the dual role-played by the tephritid Tra protein in sex determination.For the sake of simplification, the tra\npre-mRNA is shown as containing a single male-specific exon (yellow box); the white boxes represent common exons. The dsx pre-mRNA shows only\nthe one common exon (white box), a female-specific exon (grey box) and a male-specific exon (yellow box). The lines represent introns. AAA stands\nfor polyadenylation. The black, yellow and red rectangles represent the Tra-Tra2, the RBP1 and the Tra2-ISS binding sites respectively. The X-SR fac tor\nrefers to the unknown factor mentioned in the text. The green part of the Tra protein corresponds to the amino terminal region of the tephritid Tra\nprotein, which is not present in the Tra protein of the drosophilids. The complex made up by Tra, Tra2, RBP1 and X-SR inhibits splicing, whereas the\ncomplex formed by Tra, Tra2 and RBP1 promotes splicing. For details see text.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001239.g006\nAnastrepha Gene Transformer\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 November 2007 | Issue 11 | e1239\nthis scenario, the amino terminal region of the tephritid Tra\nprotein would be essential for this protein to exert its auto-\nregulation. Although both tra and dsx are transcribed within the\nsame cell, and therefore their primary transcripts are exposed to\nthe same splicing machinery, the splicing inhibitor complex\n(howsoever composed) would only be formed at tra pre-mRNA\nsince only this contains Tra2-ISS sites (see a simplified diagram in\nFig. 6).\nUnder this scenario, it is hypothesised here that in the\nphylogenetic lineage that gave rise to the drosophilids, the tra\ngene lost the Tra2-ISS binding sites and the Tra protein lost the\namino terminal region that characterises the tephritid Tra protein;\nhence, its female-specific auto-regulatory function disappeared.\nThis protein was, however, still feasible in the drosophilids because\nthe tra gene gained Sxl-binding sequences so that the female-\nspecific splicing regulation of the tra pre-mRNA came under the\ncontrol of Sxl, which is only present in females.\nThe molecular evolution of Tra\nThe phylogeny of tra reconstructed in the present work agrees well\nwith the phylogenetic relationships among the tephritids and the\ndrosophilids. The level of variation at both the nucleotide and\namino acid level differs between the drosophilids and the\ntephritids. This might be due to the protein’s auto-regulatory\nfunction in the latter.\nParticularly interesting is the comparison of tra variation\nbetween the Drosophila and Anastrepha species. McAllister and\nMcVean [36] reported high rates of neutral evolution when\ncomparing D. americana and D. virilis (separated 60 Myr ago), while\nKulathinal et al. [37] reported a high level of divergence among\nthe sibling species of the Melanogaster complex D. melanogaster, D.\nsimulans, D. mauritiana and D. sechellia (separated 2.5 Myr ago). In\nthis work, the tra gene of the twelve Anastrepha species showed\nextraordinarily reduced variation, and no insertions were detected,\nunlike in some Drosophila species. Indeed, silent variation appears\nto be significantly more common than non-silent variation when\nconsidering the complete coding region of tra, suggesting that this\ngene is subject to strong purifying selection in order to preserve the\nmechanism of action of Tra proteins.\nAlthough the SR dipeptide content of the tephritids and the\ndrosophilids is also different, the distribution of these regions over\nthe Tra protein is very much conserved within both groups. This\nsupports the proposal that during the evolution the Tra proteins\nthese maintained enough SR dipeptides regions to bestow\nfunctionality on these proteins [32]. The Tra proteins seem to\nlack an RNA binding domain so that its role in splicing regulation\nis exerted at the level of its interaction (through their SR domains)\nwith other proteins carrying RNA-binding domains, such as\nTransformer-2 (reviewed in [32]).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nSpecies\nThe species of Anastrepha studied, their host fruits, and the sites\nwhere they were collected are described in Ruiz et al. [29].\nAnastrepha ludens was provided by Pablo Montoya (Programa\nMoscamed, Direccion General de Sanidad Vegetal, SAGAR,\nApartado Postal 368, 30700 Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico).\nExtraction of DNA and RNA\nTotal genomic DNA was isolated from flies according to Maniatis\net al. [38] Total RNA extracts from frozen adult males and\nfemales were prepared using the Ultraspec-II RNA isolation kit\n(Biotecx) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The Genome-\nWalker genomic library of A. obliqua was synthesised using the BD\nGenomeWalker Universal kit (BD Biosciences), following the\nmanufacturer’s instructions\nPCR and RT-PCR analyses\nFive hundred nanograms of genomic DNA from each adult insect\nwere used in PCR analyses. Five micrograms of total RNA from\neach were reverse transcribed with Superscript (Invitrogen)\nfollowing the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten percent of the\nsynthesized cDNA was amplified by PCR. PCR and RT-PCR\nproducts were analysed by electrophoresis in agarose gels and the\namplified fragments sub-cloned using the TOPO TA-cloning kit\n(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. These\nsubclones were then sequenced using universal forward and\nreverse primers. Figure 1 shows the sequences and location of the\nprimers. Reverse transcription reactions were performed with the\noligo-dT primer. The tra genomic region that is involved in sex-\nspecific splicing regulation in all Anastrepha species was amplified\nusing the pair of primers TRA39 and TRA41, which are common\nto all Anastrepha species. The sequences of all primers used in this\nwork are shown in Table S1 in Supporting material.\nIsolation of genetra of A. obliqua\nThe first step in the isolation of the A. obliqua tragene (Aotra) was to\nperform RT-PCR on total RNA from female adults. Reverse\ntranscription was performed using the primer oligo-dT, while\nPCR was performed with three designed primers: DOMA2 + and\nCcCATs-, specific for the beginning of exon 2 and close to the end\nof exon 4 of the C. capitata tra (Cctra)gene respectively, and PyA-,\na degenerate primer designed after comparison of the Cctra and B.\noleae tra (Botra) sequences. The two amplified fragments were\ncloned and sequenced. The conceptual amino acid sequences of\nthese fragments showed a high degree of similarity with the region\nof the CcTra protein encoded by exons 2–4, indicating that\na fragment of the putative AoTra protein had been isolated.\nTo determine the molecular organisation of Aotra the following\nstrategy was followed. Firstly, 3 9- and 5 9-RACE analyses were\nperformed. To this end, specific primers from the amplified\nsequenced were synthesised: AZ1 + and AZ2+ for 39-RACE, and\nB41- and B42- for 5 9-RACE. These primers were used in nested\nPCR reactions, the products of which were cloned and sequenced.\nThe 5 9-RACE generated three overlapping fragments of about\n300, 450 and 500 bp. The largest one contained the start ATG\ncodon of the tra ORF. Thus, exon 1 and the 5 9UTR were\nidentified. The 3 9-RACE, which produced three overlapping\nfragments of about 243, 288 and 528 bp, allowed the identification\nof the end of exon 4 and the 3 9UTR region containing the three\npoly-A(+) signals corresponding to the three amplified fragments.\nConsequently, the gene Aotra encodes three female mRNAs of\n1894, 1654 and 1603 bp that differ in the length of the 3 9-UTR\ndepending on the poly-A( +) signal used. Next, RACE overlapping\nPCR was performed on cDNA synthesised from total RNA of\nadult males. The amplified fragments were cloned and their\nsequences compared to that of the female cDNA. Five different\nisoforms of male mRNA of 2326 (M1), 2285 (M2), 2108 (M3),\n2412 (M4), and 2145 (M5) bp were found, depending on the male-\nspecific exons included (see Fig. 1B).\nSecondly, the GenomeWalker kit was used to perform PCR on\ngenomic DNA of A. obliqua in order to determine the exon/intron\njunctions via genomic walking. The sequences of the genomic\nfragments thus generated were compared with the A. obliqua male\nand female cDNA sequences previously determined. In this way,\nthe exon/intron junctions were unambiguously identified.\nAnastrepha Gene Transformer\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 November 2007 | Issue 11 | e1239\nFor identification of the Tra protein of other Anastrepha\nspecies, RT-PCR analyses of total RNA from female adults were\nperformed. Reverse transcription was performed with the oligo-dT\nprimer. PCR amplification of the cDNA was undertaken using the\npair of primers TRA23 (Table S1) plus Ao25 (Fig. 2) correspond-\ning to sequences of the Aotra gene. The first primer represents part\nof the exon 1 sequence, while the second represents part of the\nexon 4 sequence – respectively before and after the start and stop\ncodons of the ORF. Thus, the amplicon expands the whole ORF.\nAll amplicons were cloned in the TOPO-TA vector and\nsubsequently sequenced.\nDNA sequencing\nSequencing was performed using an automated 377 DNA sequencer\n(Applied Biosystems). The following list shows the accession numbers\nfor the tra gene of the Anastrepha species studied: A. obliqua\n(EU024498); A. sp.1 aff. fraterculus (EU024499); A.sp2 aff fraterculus\n(EU024500); A. sp3 aff fraterculus (EU024501); A. sp4 aff fraterculus\n(EU024502); A. grandis (EU024503); A. serpentina (EU024504); A.\nsororcula (EU024505);A striata(EU024506);A. bistrigata(EU024507);A\namita (EU024508); and A. ludens(EU024509).\nComparison of DNA and protein sequences\nAll comparisons were made using Fasta v.3.0t82 [39] and\nClustalW1.83 software [40].\nMolecular evolutionary analyses\nFor comparison of DNA and protein sequences, and for phylogenetic\nanalyses of gene tra, the methodology used for the analysis of genes\nSex-lethal [31] and dsx [29] was followed. The analysis of nucleotide\nvariation across coding regions was performed using a sliding-window\napproach, estimating the proportion (p) of nucleotide sites at which\ntwo sequences being compared are different, and the ratio between\nthe numbers of non-synonymous (pN) and synonymous (pS)s u b s t i t u -\ntions per site, with a window length of 40 bp and a step size of 10 bp.\nEstimates of the dipeptide compositions of TRA proteins from\ndifferent dipteran species were made using the services of the COPid\nServer (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/COPid/index.html).\nSUPPORTING INFORMATION\nTable S1\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001239.s001 (0.47 MB\nDOC)\nFigure S1 Comparison of the predicted Tra polypeptides of the\nAnastrepha species.
