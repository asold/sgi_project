INTRODUCTION \nThis research proposes a new approach to the increasing \nreliance on articles and journal documents by introducing a \nQuestion-Answering (QA) document processing system  [1]. \nThe identification of several critical problems  motivates this \nresearch. The problems motivating this research are \nmultifaceted. Firstly, manual reading and processing to \ncomprehend document text are time -consuming, error -prone, \nand inefficient. Secondly, previous methods employed to \nmodify Large Langu age Models (LLM) for document \nprocessing demanded substantial resources and were \nchallenging to implement widely. Lastly, models relying solely \non the capabilities of LLM for QA systems without \nmodifications tend to generate hallucinatory answers, lacking \ncorrectness and precision.  Manual processing for document \nunderstanding leads to time-consuming efforts, susceptibility to \nhuman error, and inefficient analysis processes. Based on \nprevious methods, the use of modified Large Language Models \n(LLM) for docum ent processing requires significant resources \nand poses challenges for widespread implementation. Also, the \nunderutilization of the recently discovered Retrieval \nAugmented Generation (RAG) method, particularly in \ndocument processing within Question -Answering (QA) \nsystems, provides an opportunity for further exploration. The \nmotivation stems from the challenges associated with manual \ndocument processing, resource -intensive Large Language \nModel (LLM) modifications, and the underutilization of the \nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method in the \ndocument-based question -answering domain  [2], [3] . In \naddition, there is a tendency to produce hallucinatory responses \nthat lack accuracy and precision in models that rely solely on \nLLM capabilities for QA systems w ithout modifications. \nFinally, the implementation of RAG in QA systems for \ndocument processing offers the untapped potential to improve \nthe ability of the system to produce accurate and non -\nhallucinatory responses. \nBuilding on this line of research, this p aper proposes the \nimplementation of the Retrieval Augmented Generation model \nfor document question  answering tasks, specifically using the \nChatGPT model.  RAG, introduced in 2021  [4], addresses the \nlimitations of previous methods by merging parametric and \nnon-parametric memory. This hybrid model seamlessly \nintegrates generative capabilities with data retrieval \nmechanisms, linking language models to external knowledge \nsources. RAG combines generative capabilities and the ability \nto search for data and in corporate relevant information from \nthe knowledge base in the model.  The distinct advantage s of \nRAG lie in its ability to adapt to dynamic data, its flexibility in \nworking with external data sources, and its ability to mitigate \nhallucinatory responses [5]. These characteristics make RAG \nparticularly suitable for QA tasks on internal organi zational \ndocuments by leveraging external knowledge to reduce \nresponse hallucinations [6]. \nThe current research aims to exploit the innovative \napproach of RAG to const ruct an application capable of \nautomatically processing external text documents. The focus of \nthis research is to develop an application system capable of \nprocessing external document text uploaded by the user . The \nsystem will automatically read the docume nt text, allowing \nusers to input questions related to the document. Subsequently, \nthe system provides answers based on the processed document \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 15, No. 3, 2024 \n777 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ntext, eliminating the need for manual reading to find answers . \nThis comprehensive solution not only overcomes the \nlimitations of previous methods, but also promises to \nsignificantly speed up research and study exploration in \nvarious domains. \nTesting of the proposed model is performed , like several \nprevious QA-based studies, by calculating the suitability of the \nanswer results provided by the model with the ground truth of \nthe test dataset. Some of the metrics used to calculate the \nperformance of this model include Accuracy, ROUGE, BLEU, \nBERTScore, and Jaccard Similarity. \nII. RELATED WORKS \nThis study examines the applicabil ity of RAG, its impact \non the document processing task, and compares it to the \nprevious methods. This research also investigates the capability \nof the large language model within the ChatGPT systems, gpt-\n3.5-turbo within the framework of RAG. This work als o \nhighlights the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI ) and \nNatural Language Processing (NLP) , so this  research focuses \non the improvement of intelligence and the capabilities of \napplications [7], [8], [9]. Machine Learning and Deep Learning \nalgorithms, which include BERT Base , and Text-to-Text \nTransfer Transformer (T5) models , and  RAG method, have \nmade significant advances in QA tasks  [4], [10], [11], [12] . \nThis research motivated the implementation of RAG for \nprocessing documents, integrat ed in to an interactive QA \nsystem. \nBetween 2015 and the present, the evolution of question -\nanswering (QA) systems shows a trajectory characteri zed by \ndiverse methodologies.  Starting with semantic parsing -based \nsystems in 2015, Wen -tau Yih et al. focused on  transforming \nnatural language queries into structured logical forms, \nachieving a performance of 52.5% in  the F1-score [2]. \nSubsequent knowledge-based paradigms (KB-QA) by Yanchao \nHao et al. in 2017 reformulated questions as predicates, \nachieving a performance of 42.9% [3]. Progress has been made \nin integrating AI technologies. Caiming Xiong's exploration of \ndynamic memory networks (DMN) in 2016 , achieved an \naccuracy of 28.79% [7]. In the same year, Minjoon Seo et al.'s \nBi-Directional Attention Flow ( BiDAF) framework \ndemonstrated significant performance with a 68% exact match \nand 77.3% F1 score, albeit with a computational time of 20 \nhours [8]. Adams Wei Yu et al. introduced the QANet model in \n2018, with a performance of 76.2% exact match and 84.6% F1-\nScore, within a shorter computational time of 3 hours  [9]. As \nQA systems evolve, in 2019 Wei Yang et al. applied fine -\ntuning methods with data augmentation techniques, achieving \nremarkable results wit h a modified BERT -Base model of \n49.2% for exact match and 65.4% for F1 -Score [10]. Colin \nRaffel et al. introduced the Text -to-Text Transfer Transformer \n(T5), with impressive performance of 63.3% for exact match, \n94.1% for F1 score, and a peak accuracy of 93.8%, albeit with \nan increased number of parameters of 11 billion [11]. In 2020, \nthe focus was on fine -tuning pre -trained models, with Adam \nRoberts et al. achieving a recall performance of 34.6% using \nthe T5 model [12]. The Retrieval -Augmented Generation \n(RAG) method, which combines parametric an d non -\nparametric methods, was introduced by Patrick Lewis et al. in \n2021. RAG has demonstrated its capabilities in open domain \nQA tasks, overcoming previous limitations to deliver more \nefficient and comprehensive QA systems [4]. \nLarge language model call ed GPT, or Generative Pre -\nTrained Transformer  was developed by OpenAI. Previous \nresearch that has compared the performance of ChatGPT with \nother large language models like PaLM and LLaMA  in open-\ndomain QA tasks indicates that ChatGPT consistently achieves \nthe highest scores across various open -domain QA datasets  \n[13]. Table I presents performance comparisons among LLMs. \nTABLE I.

According to the evaluations, the gpt -3.5-turbo \nmodel has been selected for implementation in this research. \nIII. RESEARCH METHOD \nThis research undergoes a development phase, starting \nwith designing the application system and integrating the APIs \nof ChatGPT, LangChain and FAISS. Subsequent stages \ninclude extensive system modeling, interface testing and data \npreparation using the proposed dataset and the SQuAD \ndataset. The testing phase, which includes a performance \ncomparison with other applications using ground truth metrics \n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEU and Jaccard Similarity), guides \nthe exploration of the capabilit ies of the proposed system, as \nshown in Fig. 1. \nA. RAG Integration \nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval \nand generation models. It uses a Large Language Model \n(LLM) to generate text based on commands and integrates \ninformation from a separate retrieval system to improve output \nquality and contextual relevance [14]. The mechanism involves \nretrieving factual content from a knowledge base via retrieval \nmodels and using generative processes to provide additional \ncontext for more accurate output [15]. External data sources are \nused, and the numerical representation is facilitated by \nembedding methods to ensur e compatibility. Based on Fig.  2, \nuser queries converted into embeddings are compared with \nvectors from the knowledge lib rary. Relevant context is added \nto the queries before they are fed into the base language model. \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 15, No. 3, 2024 \n778 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n \n \nFig. 1. Research flow diagram. \nOpenAI, the creator of the Large Language Model GPT, \nconducted a comprehensive number of RAG experiments, \nexploring various implementations such as cosine similarity \nretrieval, chunk/embedding experiments, reranking, \nclassification steps, and prompt engineering, as depicted in Fig. \n3. OpenAI's findings, presented in Fig.  3, revealed that RAG \nimplementation with prompt engineering achieved the highest \naccuracy, positioning it as the most effective RAG technique to \ndate [16]. This discovery serves as a catalyst for the integration \nof RAG with prompt engineering using the LangChain module. \n \nFig. 2. RAG mechanism with LLM. \n \nFig. 3. Accuracy of the RAG method by Open AI. \nLangChain provides a robust data processing pipeline that \nutilizes FAISS to perform an efficient retrieval operation in the \nVectorDB. The query phase transforms inputs into vectors for \ndatabase searches, and prompt engineering enhances the \nreusability of retrievals. Output parsers interpret LLM outputs, \nensuring consistency [17]. A highly efficient similarity search \nand vector clustering library, Facebook AI Similarity Search or \nFAISS [18]. It optimizes the trade-off between memory, speed \nand accuracy, allowing developers to effectively navigate \nmultimedia documents. The mechanism involves the \nconstruction of an index for efficient storage, with vector \nsearches retrieving the most similar vect ors using cosine \nsimilarity scores [19]. \nB. Proposed Model \nThis research employs a modified Large Language Model \n(LLM), ChatGPT, augmented with additional libraries to \nfunction as a Question -Answering (QA) system capable of \nprocessing external documents for supplementary information. \nA \nA \n\n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 15, No. 3, 2024 \n779 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThe chosen methodology for QA system development is the \nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. Unlike \nprevious approaches such as semantic parsing -based, \nknowledge-based, and fine -tuning using LSTM or other DL \nalgorithms, RAG addresses shortcomings like difficulty \nexpanding or revising model memory,  an inability to provide \ndirect insight into generated predictions, and a tendency to \nproduce hallucinative answers  [12]. The solution involves the \ncreation of a hybrid mode l, merging generative and retrieval \nmodels, which forms  the basis for the RAG method. RAG \noffers advantages such as adaptive responses to dynamic data, \nflexibility with external data sources, and minimization of \nhallucinative responses [5]. Thus, RAG is chosen to construct a \ntext document-based QA system interacting with users through \na chatbot interface. The system's workflow, implemented using \nRAG and supporting libraries like LangChain and  FAISS, is \nillustrated in Fig. 4. \nThe integration of the LangCha in framework into the QA \ndocument system includes document loading, memory \nmanagement, and prompting to connect to the LLM model. \nThe process starts with document loading, followed by \ndocument splitting into text chunks. These text chunks undergo \nword embe dding, converting them into vectors stored in the \nvector database. Simultaneously, user -inputted text questions \nare embedded and converted into word vectors. The system \nconnects these vectors to the vector database, performing a \nsemantic search and ranking  the relevance between vectors. \nThe semantic search results in relevant context between \nquestions and answers. The system retrieves pertinent answers \nbased on user queries and sends them to the LLM (using the \nChatGPT model). The final outcome involves the system \nreceiving LLM-generated answers and delivering them to the \nuser. The application system interacts with users, requiring an \ninterface connecting the user and the system. Mockups, design \nlayouts, and elements for the web application are created using \nthe Streamlit framework, facilitating rapid development and \nsharing of the AI model web application. The mockup for the \napplication system and user interaction within the system is \ndepicted in Fig. 5. \n \nFig. 4. Integration of langchain framework in RAG for the proposed document QA system. \n \nFig. 5. Mockup of the application system and user interaction for the app. \n\n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 15, No. 3, 2024 \n780 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nC. Proposed Dataset DocuQA \nThe proposed dataset, DocuQA, designed for application -\nbased question -answering system s that process document \ninputs, consists of 20 diverse documents, encompassing journal \narticles, news reports, financial documents, and tutorials. Each \ndocument file includes five  questions with corresponding \nground truth answers, enabling a thorough evalu ation of QA \nsystem capabilities, with a total 100 questions in the dataset. \nDocuQA consists of journal documents with calculations and \nformulas, news documents with specific titles, financial reports \nand news documents with numbers and currency data, and \ntutorial documents with step -by-step instructions . Accuracy \ncan be  calculated based on the correct answers out of 100, \nproviding a metric for information extraction accuracy. The \ndataset aims to challenge QA systems in understanding \ncontext, identifying key words, and efficiently extracting \nspecific information, offering a robust evaluation tool for \ndevelopers and researchers across various document and \nquestion types. The dataset can be accessed publicly [20]. \nProper citation of the dataset is encouraged for research or \nprojects using DocuQA to ensure appropriate credit is given . \nThe preview of the DocuQA dataset can be seen in Fig. 6. \n \nFig. 6. Preview of the DocuQA test dataset. \nD. Testing and Evaluation \nThe tests were performed on two types of test datasets, with \nDocuQA [20] and SQuAD 1.1  [21]. DocuQA is a dataset \noriginally created by this research, consisting of 100 questions \nwith the ground truth and a total of 20 test documents for \ndocument-based QA systems. In addition, the SQuAD dataset \nwas used in the fo rm of modified pdf documents that can be \nused to test the QA system's ability to process documents and \nretrieve information based on the questions and related ground \ntruth in the SQuAD dataset. Both types of test datasets will be \ntested on the QA system de veloped in this research, and also \non other commercial QA systems that process pdf documents, \nsuch as typeset.io. The results of these tests will give an idea of \nthe QA system performance built on this research, whether it is \nsuperior to other document-based QA applications. \nThe proposed QA document processing system is evaluated \nthrough rigorous testing using established metrics such as  \nROUGE or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting \nEvaluation, BERTscore, BLEU  or Bilingual Evaluation \nUnderstudy, and Jaccard Similarity. These metrics provide \nreliable benchmarks for assessing the system's performance \nacross various dimensions. The testing process involves two \nkey variables. \"Predictions RAG\" and \"Prediction Others\" \nrepresent the test results from the developed application and \ncomparable commercial applications, respectively. Both sets of \npredictions are compared to the ground truth  data, which is \nencapsulated in the \"references\" variable. Different aspects of \nlanguage models and question answering systems are evaluated \nusing different metrics . ROUGE measures the overlap in \nsummarization [22]. BERTscore assesses semantic similarity \nusing contextual embeddings  [23]. BLEU evaluates n -gram \nprecision [24], and Jaccard Similarity compares text simil arity \nbased on word or n -gram overlap [25]. Precision in question \nanswering systems is commonly assessed through accuracy, F1 \nscore, and precision metrics, providing insights into their \neffectiveness. The metrics are used to quantitatively evaluate \nsystem performance and establish its superiority over existing \ncommercial applications in document processing and \ninformation retrieval tasks. \n1) Accuracy: Accuracy is defined as the  proportion of \ncorrect responses from the total number of responses. \nAccuracy can be calculated by calculating the percentage of \ncorrect predictions over the total number of references  [26]. In \nessence, accuracy represents the ability of the system to \nprovide correct answers, which is expressed as a percentage \nusing the following formula (see Eq.(1)). \nAccuracy=\ncorrect predictions\nall predictions  ×100%                        (1) \nThis metric serves as a valuable indicator of the overall \ncorrectness of the model in the response it generates. \n2) ROUGE: Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting \nEvaluation can be used to evaluate the text generation models, \nwhich are based on the measurement of the overlap between \ncandidate text and reference text  [27]. ROUGE has several \nmeasurement variants, each depending on the number of \noverlapping n -grams. The ROUGE -L variant is the most \nwidely used, because it uses the longest sequence or longest \ncommon subsequence or LCS with the longest word sequence \nthat both sentences have. Precision refers to the proportion of \nn-grams in the candidate that are also in the reference (see Eq. \n2.). Recall, on the other hand , refers  to the  proportion of n -\ngrams that are in the reference text that exactly match in the \npredicted candidate text as shown in Eq. (3) . The F1-score can \nbe calculated from the precision and recall as shown in Eq. \n(4). \nROUGE-Lrecall=\nLCS (candidate, reference)\n#words in reference                  (2) \nROUGE-Lprecision=\nLCS (candidate, reference)\n#words in candidate                (3) \nROUGE-LF1-Score= 2×\nrecall ∙ precision\nrecall + precision                (4) \nwhere, the reference is based on the ground truth in the test \ndataset, and the candidate is from the system predictions. The \nscore generated by the ROUGE measure is between 0 and 1. A \n\n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 15, No. 3, 2024 \n781 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nscore of 1 indicates total agreement between reference and \ncandidate text. \n3) BERTScore: BERTScore is an automatic evaluation \nmetric in text generation tasks that evaluates the similarity of \neach candidate sentence token to each reference sentence \ntoken by means of contextual embeddings  [23]. The \nembeddings in BERTScore are contextual, changing \ndepending on the sentence context. The context awareness \nallows BERTScore to score semantically similar sentences \ndespite their different sentence order.  For the recall \ncalculation, each token in 𝑥 is matched with the most similar \ntoken in 𝑥̂, as for the precision calculation. Greedy matching is \nused to maximize the similarity score. The  values of precision \n(see Eq. (5)), recall (see Eq. (6)) and F1 score (see Eq. (7)) for \nreference 𝑥  and candidate 𝑥̂  can be calculated using the \nfollowing equations. \nRBERT = \n1\n|x| ∑ max  \nx̂j ∈ x̂xi ∈ x\nxi\n⊤x̂j                    (5) \nwhere, 𝑅𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 is the Recall BERTScore, 𝑥 is the reference \ntoken, 𝑥̂ is the candidate token, 𝑥𝑖 is the sequence vector 𝑥, 𝑥𝑗 \nis the sequence vector 𝑥̂ , where 𝛴𝑥𝑖∈𝑥  is the number of 𝑥𝑖 \npresent in 𝑥, and also 𝑚𝑎𝑥 \n𝑥̂𝑗 ∈ 𝑥̂ \n is the maximum value of 𝑥̂𝑗 present \nin 𝑥̂, and 𝑥𝑖\n⊤𝑥̂𝑗  is the cosine similarity of 𝑥 and 𝑥̂. \nPBERT = \n1\n|x̂| ∑ max  \nxi ∈ xx̂j ∈ x̂\nxi\n⊤x̂j                       (6) \nGiven 𝑃𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇  as Precision BERTScore, 𝑥  as reference \ntoken, 𝑥̂  as candidate token, 𝑥𝑖  as sequence vector 𝑥 , 𝑥̂𝑗  as \nsequence vector 𝑥̂, where 𝛴𝑥̂𝑗 ∈ 𝑥̂ is the number of 𝑥̂𝑗 present in \n𝑥̂, and also 𝑚𝑎𝑥 \n𝑥𝑖 ∈ 𝑥 \n is the maximum value of 𝑥𝑖 present in 𝑥, and \n𝑥𝑖\n⊤𝑥̂𝑗  is the cosine similarity of 𝑥 and 𝑥̂. \nFBERT = 2×\nPBERT   ⋅  RBERT\nPBERT +  RBERT\n                             (7) \nwhere 𝐹𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 is the F1 -score of BERTScore, then 𝑃𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇  is \nthe precision and 𝑅𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 is the recall from BERTScore results. \nAlthough the cosine similarity value is theoretically in the \ninterval [ -1, 1], in practice the value is rescaled so that it is \nbetween 0 and 1 in the result of the BERTScore calculation. \n4) BLEU: Bilingual Evaluation Understudy is a metric \nthat computes a modification of precision for n -grams, \ncombines it with weights, and applies a brevity penalty to \nobtain the final BLEU score [28]. The score range of BLEU is \nfrom 0 to 1. The greater the BLEU score, the better  the \nsystem's performance  is considered to be compared to the \nreferences. The formula for calculating BLEU can be seen in \nEq. (8). \nBLEU=BP⋅exp (∑ wn log pn\nN\nn=1\n)                  (8) \n𝐵𝑃 represents the brevity penalty, adjusting the score to \npenalize translations shorter than the reference . 𝑁 denotes the \nmaximum number of considered n -grams. The precision for n-\ngrams, denoted as  𝑝𝑛  signifies the n -grams ratios by the \ncandidate text that appearing in any reference translation to the \ntotal of n-grams in the candidate text. 𝑤𝑛 represents the weight \nassigned to each n-gram precision score. \n5) The Jaccard similarity quantifies the similari ty \npercentage between two sets of data by identifying the \ncommon and the different members [29]. This can be \ncalculated by divid ing the number of observations shared by \nthe sum of the  observations in each of the two sets . Jaccard \nsimilarity can be expressed as the ratio of the intersection  \n(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) to the union (𝐴 ∪ 𝐵) of two sets (see Eq. (9)). \nJ(A,B)= |A∩B|\n|A∪B|                                 (9) \n|𝐴 ∩ 𝐵| indicates the size of the intersection of the sets A \nand B, and |𝐴 ∪ 𝐵| indicates the size of the union of the sets A \nand B. The Jaccard similarity is bounded in the range from 0 to \n1. A Jaccard similarity of 1 indicates complete identity \nbetween the sets, while a similarity of 0 implies that the sets \nhave no common elements. \nIV. RESULT AND DISCUSSION \nA.

If the user clicks the \nsubmit button, the system will process the PDF document to \nconvert it to vector form with embedding (as describe d in the \nRAG mechanism in Fig.  2). Once the document submission \nprocess is complete, the user can ask questions related to the \nsubmitted document, and the QA system will provide answers \nbased on the source documents provided. The set of questions \nand answers generated from the user's i nteraction with the QA \nsystem will be in the form of a chatbot, so that it st ores the \ncommunication history. \nB. Accuracy \nAccuracy in our system model is expressed as the \npercentage of correct answers within the entire answer key \ndataset. To assess accuracy, w e calculate the ratio of the \nnumber of correct predictions to the total number of predictions \n[26]. The visualization of this accuracy result can be figured in \nFig. 8. \nThe accuracy comparison between the proposed QA \ndocument system and other applications reveals the superiority \nof our method.

These results \nunderscore the superior performance of our  proposed method \nacross both datasets that can be visualized in Fig. 10. \nE. BLEU Accuracy \nThe BLEU metric score taken is the precision value, to \ncapture the ability of each model to extract keyword answers \nthat match the ground truth. Specifically, on our dat aset, our \nproposed method demonstrated precision of 28.2%. In \ncomparison, other QA applications achieved lower \nperformance precision 9.7%. Similarly, on the SQuAD dev \ndataset, our proposed method excelled with precision 17.7%, \nwhile other QA applications reported lower scores of precision \n5.6%.

BERTScore result of proposed method using RAG and other document QA application. \n \nFig. 11. BLEU precision result of proposed method using RAG and other document QA application. \n\n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 15, No. 3, 2024 \n784 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n \nFig. 12. Jaccard Similarity result of proposed method using RAG and other document QA application. \nOur system's precision, recall, and F1 -Score are 82.8%, \n87%, and 84.8%, respectively, which surpass the precision of \n62%, recall of 87%, and F1 -Score of 67% reported in other \nresearch [32]. The proposed QA system's effectiveness is \naffirmed by the fact that it surpasses the recall result of other \nresearch with 42.70% [33] and outperforms other research \n[31], [34], [35] in terms of F1-Score, which is 42.6% [31], 49% \n[34], and 70.8% [35]. This positions it as a leading solution for \nautomatic document processing and information retrieval tasks \nacross a wide range of domains. \nBased on the results of testing the proposed model, the \nresults of the present study agree with previous literature \nstudies, namely that the RAG  method, through the \nimplementation of a hybrid model combining parametric and \nnonparametric models, is able to provide good results  [4]. In \nthis case we combine the LangChai n and FAISS frameworks \nfor the RAG technique, and it can provide a good result. This \nmodel also c ombined with the use of the best language model  \nat this current time like GPT-3.5, which provides good results. \nThis is a very interesting performance that should be further \ndeveloped. \nV. CONCLUSION \nOur proposed model for Question -Answering (QA) \ndocument processing integrates the Retrieval -Augmented \nGeneration (RAG) model. The evaluation of our proposed QA \nsystem demonstrates its superiority over existing commercial \napplications in terms of Accuracy, ROUGE -L scores, \nBERTScore metrics, BLEU precision, and Jaccard Similarity. \nThe proposed method achieved high accuracy rates of 96% and \n95.5% on our dataset and the SQuAD dev dataset, respectively, \noutperforming other applications tested on the same datasets. \nOur system's precision, recall, and F1 -Score metrics were \nsuperior to those of other QA applications on both datasets, as \nhighlighted by the ROUGE -L evalu ation. Additionally, the \nBERTScore metrics consistently showed higher precision, \nrecall, and F1 -Score for our proposed method compared to \nother applications. In addition, our QA system has \ndemonstrated superior performance in keyword extraction and \ntext si milarity compared to other applications, as assessed by \nBLEU precision and Jaccard Similarity. \nVI. FUTURE WORKS \nIn the future, studies could be conducted to refine the \narchitecture of the system, explore additional ways of using \nexternal data, and improve the scalability of the model for \nbroader applications. The i ntegration of user feedback \nmechanisms and continuous learning modules could contribute \nto the adaptability of the system and further improve its \naccuracy over time. In addition, exploring ways of pro cessing \ndocuments in real time and extending the system's \ncompatibility with different document formats could open up \nnew opportunities for research and study. \nREFERENCES \n[1] F.
