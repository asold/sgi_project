    "abstract": "Abstract The electrophysical characteristics of experimental types of electrical insulating paper modified by bacterial cellulose made of nano-gel film Komagataeibacter xylinus , disintegrated in various ways, were studied. The advantage of composites over traditional electrical insulating paper made of pine cellulose is shown in terms of electrical and mechanical strength, sorption activity and heat resistance. The efficiency of using an industrial blender to grind bacterial cellulose has been confirmed, which significantly reduces the time of its high-quality grinding.",
