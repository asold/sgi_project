These models, built on advanced deep \nlearning architectures, are trained on massive datasets to acquire a deep understanding of human language \nand its nuances. Consequently, LLMs exhibit remarkable capabilities across various AI tasks, including \nnatural language processing, text generation, and even decision-making. \n \nInternational Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) \n \nE-ISSN: 2582-2160   ●   Website: www.ijfmr.com       ●   Email: editor@ijfmr.com \n \nIJFMR23033342 Volume 5, Issue 3, May-June 2023 2 \n \n \nIn recent years, decision -making has emerged as a critical area where LLMs have showcased their \npotential[1]. By leveraging their extensive language understanding and pattern recognition abilities, LLMs \ncan analyze complex information, reason through differe nt scenarios, and generate informed decisions. \nThis has opened up new possibilities for applying LLMs in decision -making processes across diverse \ndomains, ranging from finance and healthcare to customer service and legal analysis. \n \nAmong the numerous LLMs developed, Bard and GPT (Generative Pre -trained Transformer) have \nemerged as prominent contenders. Bard is known for its superior logical reasoning capabilities, while GPT \nhas garnered attention for its exceptional performance in tasks such as text generat ion and language \nunderstanding. Comparing the decision -making efficiency of these two LLMs can provide valuable \ninsights into their relative strengths and weaknesses, enabling practitioners to make informed choices \nwhen employing LLMs in decision-making contexts. \n \nThe primary objective of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of Bard and GPT \nin terms of their decision -making efficiency across different domains. By evaluating their performance \nusing carefully designed domain -specific questions, we aim to quantify their abilities and uncover any \ndiscernible variations in their decision-making effectiveness. \n \nUnderstanding the relative performance of Bard and GPT in decision-making is of paramount importance \nfor several reasons. Firstly,  decision-making is a complex cognitive process that involves assessing \ninformation, reasoning, and selecting the best course of action. LLMs have the potential to augment and \nautomate decision -making processes, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy. H owever, the \neffectiveness of LLMs may vary depending on the specific domain and context in which decisions are \nmade. By comparing Bard and GPT, we can identify the domains where each model excels, allowing us \nto harness their strengths in relevant decision-making scenarios. \n \nSecondly, real-world decision-making often involves different types of tasks that rely on diverse cognitive \nskills. For example, logical reasoning tasks require the ability to analyze relationships and draw valid \nconclusions, while error detection tasks demand a keen eye for identifying deviations and inconsistencies. \nBy examining the performance of Bard and GPT across these varied domains, we can gain insights into \ntheir respective strengths and weaknesses, which can guide practitioners  in selecting the most suitable \nmodel for specific decision-making requirements. \n \nLastly, as LLMs continue to advance and find applications in critical decision -making domains such as \nhealthcare diagnostics, legal analysis, and financial forecasting, it be comes essential to understand their \ncapabilities and limitations. By conducting a thorough evaluation of Bard and GPT, we aim to contribute \nto the knowledge base surrounding LLMs and provide valuable insights for practitioners and researchers \nalike. \n \nIn the subsequent sections of this paper, we will detail the methodology employed for evaluating Bard and \nGPT’s decision-making efficiency, present the specific domains chosen for analysis, and describe the \ndesigned questions tailored to each domain. We will then present the results of the comparative analysis, \n \nInternational Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) \n \nE-ISSN: 2582-2160   ●   Website: www.ijfmr.com       ●   Email: editor@ijfmr.com \n \nIJFMR23033342 Volume 5, Issue 3, May-June 2023 3 \n \ndiscussing the performance of Bard and GPT in each domain. Finally, we will provide a comprehensive \ndiscussion and conclusion, summarizing the findings and outlining the implications for the practical \napplication of LLMs in decision-making contexts. \n \nThrough this comparative study, we aim to enhance our understanding of the decision -making efficiency \nof Bard and GPT, empowering practitioners to make informed decisions regarding the selection and \nutilization of LLMs in real-world scenarios.  \n \nMethods \nTo conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of Bard and GPT’s decision-making efficiency[2], we \ndesigned a rigorous methodology that involved the formulation of domain -specific questions and the \nevaluation of their performance on these tasks. The following section outlines the steps taken to ensure a \nfair and systematic comparison between the two LLMs. \n \n1. Selection of Domains: \nWe carefully selected a diverse set of domains to assess the decision-making capabilities of Bard and GPT. \nThese domains were chosen to represent different cognitive tasks and decision-making contexts, allowing \nus to evaluate the models’ performance across a range of scenarios. The selected domains included logical \nreasoning dependent decision making (LRDM), error detection dependent decision making (EDM), and \ndata analysis dependent decision making (DADM). \n \n2. Question Design: \nFor each domain, we designed a set of questions specifically tailored to assess the decision -making \nefficiency of Bard and GPT. The questions were carefully crafted to target the cognitive skills and abilities \nrequired in each domain. In the LRDM domain, the questions focused on logical reasoning, deduction, \nand inference. In the EDM domain, the questions aimed to evaluate the models’ ability to identify errors, \ninconsistencies, or anomalies. In the DADM domain, the questions were designed to assess the models’ \nproficiency in analyzing and interpreting data to make informed decisions. \n \n3. Presentation of Questions: \nBoth Bard and GPT were presented with the domain-specific questions in a controlled environment. Each \nmodel was given the same set of questions to ensure fairness and eliminate any potential bias arising from \ndifferences in the question sets. The q uestions were presented in a standardized format to ensure \nconsistency across the evaluation process. \n \n4. Scoring and Performance Evaluation: \nTo quantify the performance of Bard and GPT, we assigned a value of 1 point for each correctly answered \nquestion. The total score for each model was calculated based on the number of questions answered \ncorrectly within each domain. By adopting this scoring approach, we were able to compare the decision -\nmaking efficiency of Bard and GPT in a quantitative manner. \n \n \n \n \nInternational Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) \n \nE-ISSN: 2582-2160   ●   Website: www.ijfmr.com       ●   Email: editor@ijfmr.com \n \nIJFMR23033342 Volume 5, Issue 3, May-June 2023 4 \n \n5. Data Collection: \nWe collected the response data from Bard and GPT for each domain and compiled the results for further \nanalysis. The data included the number of correctly answered questions and the corresponding scores for \neach LLM in each domain. \n \n6. Statistical Analysis: \nTo analyze the performance of Bard and GPT, we conducted a statistical analysis of the collected data. \nThis analysis involved calculating accuracy percentages for each model within each domain, allowing us \nto determine their relative strengths and weaknesses in different decision-making contexts. \n \nBy employing this methodology, we ensured a systematic and objective evaluation of Bard and GPT’s \ndecision-making efficiency. The design of domain-specific questions and the use of standardized scoring \ncriteria enabled us to assess their performance on various cognitive tasks and provide insights into their \nrelative capabilities in different decision-making domains. \n \nMaterials \nThe materials used in this study primarily consisted of the specially designed questions that were utilized \nto evaluate the decision-making efficiency of Bard and GPT in different domains. These questions served \nas the primary means to assess the cognitive abilities and performance of the two LLMs in various \ndecision-making contexts. \n \nThe design of these questions was crucial to ensure that they effectively targeted the specific skills and \ncompetencies required in each domain. Extensive consideration was given to formulating questions that \nadequately measured the logical reasoning abi lities, error detection capabilities, and data analysis \nproficiencies of Bard and GPT. \n \nThe process of question design involved a thorough review of existing literature and established \nframeworks for assessing decision-making skills. This allowed us to draw upon established principles and \nguidelines to create questions that were valid and reliable indicators of the LLMs’ decision -making \nefficiency. The questions were carefully crafted to present realistic scenarios and challenges that mirrored \nreal-world decision-making situations. \n \nTo maintain consistency and eliminate potential biases, the same set of questions was presented to both \nBard and GPT during the evaluation process. Each question was presented in a standardized format to \nensure uniformity in the way the questions were interpreted and answered by the models. \n \nThe materials used in this study were essential for providing a standardized and controlled environment \nfor evaluating the decision-making efficiency of Bard and GPT. The questions, specifically designed for \neach domain, formed the basis for quantitatively assessing the performance of the LLMs and comparing \ntheir abilities in different decision-making tasks. \n \nIt is worth noting that the study also relied on the computational resources  and infrastructure required to \nrun the LLMs and collect their responses to the domain -specific questions. The computational resources \n \nInternational Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) \n \nE-ISSN: 2582-2160   ●   Website: www.ijfmr.com       ●   Email: editor@ijfmr.com \n \nIJFMR23033342 Volume 5, Issue 3, May-June 2023 5 \n \nensured the efficient execution of the evaluation process, enabling us to gather the necessary data for \nanalysis. \n \nOverall, the materials used in this study, primarily consisting of the domain -specific questions, played a \nvital role in evaluating the decision -making efficiency of Bard and GPT. These materials facilitated a \nstandardized evaluation process, allowing for a fair  and objective comparison of the two LLMs’ \nperformance in different decision-making domains. \nProcedure \n \nTo evaluate the decision -making efficiency of Bard and GPT, a systematic and standardized procedure \nwas followed. The following steps were taken to ensure a fair comparison between the two LLMs: \n \n1. Presentation of Domain-Specific Questions: \nBoth Bard and GPT were presented with a set of domain -specific questions that were cognitive tasks in \nnature. These questions were carefully designed to assess the decis ion-making capabilities of the LLMs \nin different domains, including logical reasoning, error detection, and data analysis. Each question was \ntailored to target the specific skills and competencies required in its respective domain. \n \n2. Scoring System: \nA scoring system was established to assign a value of 1 point to each correctly answered question. This \nsystem allowed for a quantifiable measurement of the LLMs’ performance in each domain. By assigning \na point for every correctly answered question, a numerical score was obtained for both Bard and GPT, \nreflecting their decision-making proficiency within each domain. \n \n3. Calculation of Total Score: \nThe total score for each LLM was calculated based on the number of correctly answered questions. By \nsumming up the indiv idual scores obtained for each question within a domain, a cumulative score was \ndetermined. This total score provided an overall measure of the decision -making efficiency of Bard and \nGPT in each evaluated domain. \n \nThe procedure ensured a consistent and sta ndardized approach to evaluating the decision -making \nefficiency of Bard and GPT. By presenting both LLMs with the same set of domain-specific questions and \nusing a scoring system, a clear comparison was made possible. The total scores allowed for an object ive \nassessment of the LLMs’ performance, enabling a meaningful comparison of their decision -making \nabilities in different domains. \n \nIt is important to note that the procedure employed in this study focused on quantitatively evaluating the \ndecision-making efficiency of Bard and GPT. While this approach provided valuable insights into their \nperformance, it is also essential to consider qualitative factors and the context in which decision -making \noccurs. Therefore, the results should be interpreted in conjunct ion with a broader understanding of the \nLLMs’ capabilities and limitations in real-world decision-making scenarios. \n \n \n \nInternational Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR) \n \nE-ISSN: 2582-2160   ●   Website: www.ijfmr.com       ●   Email: editor@ijfmr.com \n \nIJFMR23033342 Volume 5, Issue 3, May-June 2023 6 \n \n5. Data Analysis \nThe data analysis focused on three domains of decision-making efficiency: Logical Reasoning Dependent \nDecision Making (LRD M), Error Detection Dependent Decision Making (EDM), and Data Analysis \nDependent Decision Making (DADM). For each domain, a specific set of questions was designed to \nevaluate the decision-making performance of Bard and GPT. \n \nIn the domain of Logical Reasoning (LRDM), Bard and GPT both obtained a score of 3 points, indicating \na similar proficiency in logical reasoning tasks.  \n \nMoving on to the Error Detection (EDM) domain, both Bard and GPT achieved a score of 2 points, \nindicating a similar level of effectiv eness in error detection tasks. This suggests that both models \nperformed adequately in identifying and detecting errors within the given context. \n \nIn the Data Analysis (DADM) domain, Bard obtained a score of 11 points, while GPT scored 17 points. \nThese scores indicate that GPT outperformed Bard in the data analysis tasks. GPT’s higher score suggests \na greater proficiency in analyzing and interpreting data to make informed decisions[Table-1]. \n \nTable-1: Decision-Making Efficiency Scores by Domain: Bard vs. GPT \nDomain \nTotal \nQuestions \nBard \nCorrect \nGPT \nCorrect \nAccuracy - \nBard \nAccuracy - \nGPT \nLogical \nReasoning \n(LRDM) 4 3 3 75% 75% \nError Detection \n(EDM) 2 2 2 100% 100% \nData Analysis \n(DADM) 19 11 17 57.89% 89.47% \n \nDiscussion \nDecision-making is a multifaceted process influenced by numerous factors beyond the specific domains \nevaluated in this study[3].

The findings highlight the variations \nin performance between Bard and GPT, emphasizing the importance of considering the specific task \nrequirements and domains when selecting an LLM for decision-making purposes. \n \nDifferent LLMs may possess domain-specific strengths and weaknesses, and their performance can vary \ndepending on the nature of the decision -making task. Understanding these variations allows researchers \nand practitioners to make informed choices regarding the selection and application of LLMs in real-world \ndecision-making scenarios. \n \nIt is important to note that decision-making is a complex process influenced by various factors beyond the \ncapabilities of LLMs alone. Contextual understanding, subject matter expertise, and human judgment play \ncritical roles in decision-making. LLMs should be viewed as tools that can augment and support decision-\nmaking processes, rather than replace human involvement entirely. Therefore, the findings of this study \nshould be interpreted in conjunction with the broader context of decision -making, incorporating human \njudgment and expertise. \n \nFurther research is warranted to delve deeper into the factors contributing to the strengths and weaknesses \nof LLMs in different deci sion-making domains. Investigating the integration of domain -specific \nknowledge and reasoning capabilities into LLMs can potentially enhance their decision -making \nperformance across a wider range of tasks and domains. \n \nBy leveraging the specific capabiliti es of LLMs and considering the specific requirements of decision -\nmaking tasks[8], these powerful AI systems can be effectively utilized as valuable decision-making tools \nin various applications. Continued research and development in this field will pave th e way for \nadvancements in AI-assisted decision-making, ultimately benefiting numerous domains and industries. \n \nReferences \n1.
