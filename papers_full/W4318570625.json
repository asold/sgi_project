    "abstract": "The Internet has become a crucial space for customer feedback and the budding of various ideologies across different cultures. But some people provide their opinions whose sole meaning is different from what their figurative meanings imply. This sophisticated form of sentiment expression through mockery or irony is called sarcasm. Sarcastic form of texts has taken a prominent place in social media and their growth has become exponential in recent years through messages and posts. Sarcastic comments, tweets, or feedback can be misleading in data mining activities and may result in wrong predictions since the boundaries of the sarcastic context are not well defined. There is a need to model new systems that can precisely define the boundaries of the sentence and detect sarcasm in them. Different methods of classification have been used for sarcasm detection in various works including deep learning, neural networks, and other architectures. This paper focuses on combining the capabilities of both Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for detecting sarcastic content from text. A BERT-GCN architecture is proposed which takes as input, the graph, and text representations and learns the complex structural and semantic patterns in the text, thereby detecting sarcastic content. The efficiency of BERT-GCN is compared with various baseline methods.",
