Terminologies\nand ontologies are related. Terminologies (also\ncalled “vocabularies” and “lexicons”) are collec-\ntions oflabels or terms (or“entities”) particular to\na subject field or domain of human activity,\ndeveloped for the purpose of documenting and\npromoting correct usage. Ontologies are similar to\nterminologies, but generally contain rich knowledge\nabout their terms (through attributes and relations)\nwith the goal of describing the entities that exist in a\ndomain. Many terminologies and ontologies have\nbeen appearing throughout biomedicine, including\ngenomics,\n1 molecular biology,2 anatomy,3 clinical\nresearch,4 and clinical care.5\nThe radiology community has also recently\nrecognized the need for developing a standardized\nterminology. Hospitals contain a diversity of\ncomputerized information systems, and they often\nrefer to the same procedures, findings, and\ndiagnoses using different terminologies. The lack\nof standards in terminology conventions creates a\nbarrier for comparing studies across enterprises\nand among health organizations, and it also\n1From the Section of Medical Informatics, Stanford Univer-\nsity, MSOB X-215, 251 Campus Drive, Stanford, CA 94305,\nUSA.\n2From the Department of Radiology, Stanford Medical\nCenter, 300 Pasteur Drive, Mail Code 5621, Stanford, CA\n94305-5120, USA.\nCorrespondence to: Daniel L.

However, it soon\nbecame evident that these tools were too limited\nfor accessing and managing RadLex. First, as\nRadLex is a large taxonomy, it is difficult to\nvisualize and navigate RadLex using conventional\ntools such as word processors and spreadsheets.\nSecond, RadLex contains many attributes associ-\nated with each term, and it is difficult to maintain\nthis information in correct structured form as\nRadLex grows. Third, although text documents\nand spreadsheets were a simple initial format for\ncollecting the RadLex terms, they are not suitable\nfor distributing RadLex on the Web or for making\nit accessible to applications. A tool tailored to the\nneeds of terminology development and dissemina-\ntion in radiology is needed.\nProtégé ( http://protege.stanford.edu )\n7 is an\nopen-source tool for editing and managing termi-\nnologies and ontologies. It is the most widely\nused domain-independent, freely available, plat-\nform-independent technology for developing and\nmanaging terminologies, ontologies, and knowl-\nedge bases in a broad range of application\ndomains. The community of registered Protégé\nusers exceeds 70,000. In addition, the large and\nactive Protégé user community is highly engaged\nin Protégé code development, regularly contribut-\ning enhancements to the software (http://protege.\nstanford.edu/community/wiki.html), as well as par-\nticipating in online discussion groups devoted to\nmodeling questions, technical-support issues, and\nrequests for new features (http://protege.stanford.\nedu/community/archives.html).\nProtégé has been used as the primary develop-\nment environment for many ontologies in the life\nsciences. These projects include the Foundational\nModel of Anatomy,\n3 Cerner’s Clinical Bioinfor-\nmatics ontology,8 the DICE TS,5 and the MGED\nOntology.2 Recently, the RadLex project decided\nto adopt Protégé, and RadLex is currently distrib-\nuted in Protégé XML format ( http://radlex.org/\nradlex/docs/downloads.html).\nIn this report, we introduce Protégé and highlight\nits value to managing terminology in the radiology\ndomain. Besides providing a suite of functionality\nthat helps curators edit and manage terminologies\nsuch as RadLex, Protégé provides an extensible\narchitecture to which custom functionality specific\nto radiology needs can be added, and it also\nprovides a platform for deploying radiology appli-\ncations that exploit terminologies such as RadLex.\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION\nProtégé Knowledge Model\nProtégé is a suite of tools for ontology develop-\nment and use. Before describing the tool itself, it is\nimportant to understand how terminologies and\nontologies are built and stored in computers.\nBriefly, terminologies comprise lists of terms (also\ncalled “entities”), and they may also specify\nattributes (also called“slots”) for those terms (for\nexample, RadLex contains a term called supraaortic\nvalve area, which has an attribute Version Num-\nber). Ontologies are similar to terminologies, but\ncontain rich relationships amongst terms, enabling\nthem to represent knowledge in a domain (for\nexample, a relationship SegmentOf linking supra-\naortic valve area to thoracic arota represents the\nfact that the supraaortic valve area is a segment of\nthe thoracic aorta).\nIn the Protégé knowledge model, terminologies\nand ontologies are represented using “frames”\n(classes, slots, and facets).\n9 An ontology in Protégé\nconsists of frames and axioms. Classes are the\nentities (“terms”) used in the domain of discourse.\nClasses are the sometimes-called“concepts” in ter-\nminologies. For example, if we wish to have a term\nin our RadLex vocabulary representing the supra-\naortic valve area, we would create the class supra-\naortic valve area in the Protégé ontology (Fig.1).\nSlots describe properties or attributes of classes.\nFor example, if we wanted all RadLex terms in our\nontology to have a string unique identifier called\n“Name,” which had a nonempty value, then we\nwould create a Name slot and give it the necessary\nPROTÉGÉ: A TOOL IN RADIOLOGY APPLICATIONS 35\nfacets (Fig. 2). Facets describe characteristics of\nslots (such as cardinality, required values, etc).\nFacets allow us to express the fact that the name of\na RadLex term class is required (Fig.2). Using a\nset of slots, we can fully describe each RadLex\nterm. For example, we can express the fact that the\nsupraaortic valve area is a segment of the thoracic\naorta, that“root of aorta” is a synonym, and that it\nhas a definition and a RadLex identifier of\n“RID482” (Fig. 1).\nFig 2. A Protégé“slot.” This screen capture shows a frame in Protégé representing the slot called“Name,” which is used to convey\nthe unique identifier name for a RadLex term. This name slot contains facets–components that constrain its values such as cardinality,\nvalue type, minimum, and maximum values. In this case, the facet values are saying that Name is a single-valued string, and it must have\na value for every term in RadLex. This slot is associated with all classes in RadLex; for example, for the supraaortic valve area class\n(Fig. 1), this slot has a value of“RID482.” Another slot called Preferred Name is used to store the actual name of the class,“supraaortic\nvalve area” (Fig. 1).\nFig 1. A Protégé“frame.” This screen capture shows a frame in Protégé representing the class in RadLex (a RadLex term). The class\ncontains several slots (attributes the contained values), such as a preferred name of“supraaortic valve area,” an internal RadLex\nidentifier name (“RID482”), a version number, definition, and other information such as the arterial segment of which it is a part,\nsynonyms, and other information about the term.\n36 RUBIN ET AL.\nAxioms specify additional constraints, but will\nnot be described further here as they are not used\nin RadLex at this time. Aninstance is a frame built\nfrom at least one class (“instantiation”) that carries\nparticular values for the slots. A“knowledge base”\nincludes the ontology (classes, slots, facets, and\naxioms) as well as instances of particular classes\nwith specific values for slots. The distinction\nbetween classes and instances is not an absolute\none; however, because terminologies generally do\nnot contain instances, we can simplify and limit\nour discussion to classes.\nClasses, slots, and facets are the basic building\nblocks of terminologies. A tutorial on using these\nelements and Protégé for creating terminologies\nand ontologies is available\n10 and will not be\nrepeated here. Instead, we will focus on the\nfeatures of Protégé that are particularly relevant\nto accessing, editing, and sharing ontologies and\nusing them in applications.\nArchitecture of Protégé\nProtégé is implemented in Java and runs on a\nbroad range of software platforms, including\nWindows, MacOS, Linux, and Unix. Protégé is\nbuilt using a tiered architecture (Fig.3), providing\nan ontology storage layer, a knowledge model\nlayer, a graphical user interface (GUI), and an\napplication programming interface (API). Users\nrunning the desktop application interact with\nontologies using the GUI, while application pro-\ngrams access ontologies in Protégé via the API.\nThe Protégé GUI uses the API to access the\nProtégé knowledge model of the ontology. Thus,\nthe Protégé GUI, plug-ins, and user applications all\naccess the ontology through the same API, making\nthe Protégé architecture modular and highly\nflexible (Fig. 3).\nIn addition, Protégé has a plug-in architecture,\npermitting developers to extend Protégé ’s core\nfunctionality in many ways without needing to\nmodify the Protégé source code. There are more\nthan 90 Protégé plug-ins providing advanced\ncapabilities such as import/export, validation, and\nvisualization of large ontologies ( http://protege.\ncim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl ?ProtegePluginsLibrary\nByTopic), some of which we discuss below.\nImport and export of ontology content is a\ncritical feature of any tool, because there are many\nFig 3. Protégé architecture. Protégé is built using a tiered architecture. The Protégé knowledge model is an object-oriented model\n(“OO Model”) of ontologies stored in a persistence layer (DB storage) and accessed via the Protégé API. The API is used both by the\nprotégé GUI application (View layer) with which users access the ontologies, as well as by application programs (Application layer). New\nfunctionality is added to Protégé by creating plug-ins, which access ontologies through the Protégé API and with which the user can\ninteract by plugging into the Protégé GUI.\nPROTÉGÉ: A TOOL IN RADIOLOGY APPLICATIONS 37\nformats for storing ontologies and terminologies.\nThere are several plug-ins for Protégé, enabling it\nto import and export ontologies in many different\nformats, including XML, RDF, OWL, and the\nnative Protégé format.\nIf the ontology is stored in a file, the entire\nontology is read into memory. Protégé also\nprovides a relational database backend, which is\nuseful when working with ontologies too large to\nreside in memory. Finally, through Protégé’s plug-\nin mechanism, developers can create their own\ncustom import/export plug-ins to work with cus-\ntom or specialized formats.\nProtégé Application and Graphical User\nInterface\nProtégé can be run as a stand-alone application\nor through a Protégé client in communication with\na remote server (the latter is particularly useful for\ncollaborative ontology development). When the\nProtégé desktop application is launched, the user\ncan create a new ontology, open an existing\nontology, or import an ontology from a variety of\nformats. Protégé creates a project file that records\ndisplay-related information and the location of the\nontology source file; the project file simplifies the\nprocess of reopening ontologies, and it maintains\nuser GUI customizations.\nOnce an ontology is opened, the user works with it\nin the Protégé GUI (Fig.4). The Protégé GUI is\norganized into separate panels (accessed by tabs\nalong the top of the GUI) that provide different\nviews into the contents of the ontology. The first tab\nis theClasses tab, which is the most common view\nused to browse ontologies and terminologies. On\nthis tab, the ontology is shown as an expandable\ntree on the left of the GUI, and the attributes of a\nclass selected by the user is shown on the right\n(Fig. 4). In the tree view, terms that are indented\nand below a term are called“child” terms, whereas\nthe term above is the“parent.” The interpretation of\na child term is that it is subsumed by the parent by\nan “is-a” relationship (unless the tree of classes is\ndisplayed according to a different slot). For exam-\nple, Protégé shows that the RadLex term aorta is a\nchild of systemic artery, which is interpreted as\n“aorta is-a systemic artery” (Fig. 4).\nFig 4. RadLex shown in the main Protégé user interface, which provides the ability to build, populate, and view ontologies and\nterminologies. This screen capture shows the Classes tab, in which the user creates, edits, and browses the terms in RadLex. The\ntaxonomy of Radlex is shown as an expandable tree on the left. The right panel displays the details of a RadLex term selected from the\ntree on the left. For each class selected, Protégé displays the attributes of that class (right) which users can edit. For example, the left\ncoronary sinus has been selected (left) and it is a branch of the supraaortic valve area. Other tabs in the Protégé GUI include: the Slots\ntab, for creating and editing slots; the Forms tab, for customizing layout of knowledge-entry forms (such as the one shown on the right);\nthe Instances tab for creating instances of classes and entering particular slot values for those instances; and any other special-purpose\n“plug-in” tab that the user may want to use.\n38 RUBIN ET AL.\nThe tree view of RadLex can facilitate the process\nof curating the terminology to find problems to be\ncorrected, because the various hierarchies can be\neasily expanded and browsed to detect inconsisten-\ncies. In this tree view, for example, we see that the\nsupraaortic value area is a child of thoracic aorta\n(Fig. 4; “supraaortic value area is-a thoracic\naorta”). As it is not correct to say that“supraaortic\nvalve areais-a thoracic aorta,” the RadLex ontology\nshould be changed in a future release (what was\nlikely intended was to say“supraaortic value area\npart-of thoracic aorta,” which could be reflected by\nchanging thePart-of value).\nThe classes tab permits full editing of the\nontology. In the tree view of the ontology on this\ntab, users can drag and drop classes to reorganize\nthe hierarchy, create and rename classes using\nintuitive GUI paradigms. The values for attributes\nof classes can also be directly edited. For example,\nwe could change the name of the class, left\ncoronary sinus, by simply selecting this class and\nchanging the value of the“Preferred Name” slot in\nthe GUI (Fig.4, right panel).\nThe other tabs accessible from the Protégé GUI\nare the slots, forms, and instances tab, which are\nless often used by those curating terminologies.\nThe slots tab enables users to view and edit all\nslots in an ontology; the instances tab displays all\ninstances associated with the classes; and the\nforms view permits users to customize the layout\nof the elements on display forms.\nOntology Difference\nOntologies change over time. They are devel-\noped iteratively, with incremental changes contrib-\nuted by people working collaboratively on them.\nRadLex will soon be releasing a new version,\nadding new terms as well as changes to the\noriginal terminology based on suggestions from\nusers of the first version. There is a need to\nmaintain and compare versions of ontologies,\nFig 5. Displaying changes in PromptDiff. The output from PROMPT is shown in after comparing RadLex with a version of the\nterminology that was edited to move a class, change its name, and add a slot value.Left panel: Changes to the class hierarchy are\nshown. Different styles represent different types of changes: added class is underlined and in blue; moved classes are flagged out in their\nold positions and appear in bold in their new ones.Right panel: Individual changes to the slot values for a selected class are shown (in this\ncase, for the supraaortic area class).\nPROTÉGÉ: A TOOL IN RADIOLOGY APPLICATIONS 39\nsimilar to the need for document version manage-\nment in large projects. Document versioning\nsystems enable users to compare versions, examine\nchanges, and accept or reject changes. However, a\nversioning system for ontologies must compare\nand present structural changes rather than changes\nin the text of a document.\nPROMPT is a plug-in to Protégé providing a\nsuite of tools for aligning and comparing two\nontologies. PROMPT contains PROMPTDIFF, a\nversioning environment for ontologies, allowing\ndevelopers to track changes in ontologies over\ntime.\n11,12 PROMPTDIFF is a version-comparison\nalgorithm that produces a structural difference\nbetween two versions of an ontology. The results\nare presented to the users enabling them to view\nclasses that were added, deleted, and moved. The\nusers can then act on the changes, accepting or\nrejecting them.\nSuppose we edited a copy of RadLex to update\nit based on community feedback. Consider that we\nmove the class supraaortic valve area and place it\nunder the anatomic location class, and rename it to\nsupraaortic area. In addition, suppose we create a\nnew class noncoraonary sinus under supraaortic\narea, and that we update thePart-of relationship on\nsupraaortic area to say it isPart-of thoracic aorta.\nWhen we run PROMPTDIFF, comparing our\nedited version of RadLex against the original\nversion, the PROMPT interface displays the\nfollowing differences (Fig.5):\n/C15supraaortic valve area wasrenamed to supraaortic\narea\n/C15supraaortic area was moved from being under\nthoracic aorta to being under anatomic location.\n/C15noncoraonary sinus is a new class, under\nsupraaortic area\n/C15thoracic aorta was added as a value for thePart-\nof relationship on the supraaortic area class.\nIn addition to viewing versions of ontologies,\nPROMPT also includes a tool to align two different\nontologies to locate classes that are the same or\nsimilar to each other. Such functionality could be\nuseful in RadLex for finding related terms in other\nvocabularies such as SNOMED and the ACR index.\nOntology Visualization Components\nThe Protégé GUI provides a tree view of\nontologies (Fig. 4). Although an expandable tree\nis suitable for many ontologies and terminologies,\nit can be difficult to visualize those that have\nmultiple types of relationships among the terms. A\ntree shows the relationships among terms using\none relationship (usually the is-a relationship).\nRadLex contains several types of relationships,\nFig 6. Visualizing RadLex using the OntoViz plug-in for Protégé. This visualization plug-in for Protégé displays an ontology as a graph\n(right panel). Ontology classes are shown as boxes, and the relationships among them are shown as arcs. The label on the arc is the\nname of the relationship. The user can select the classes to be displayed in the graph (lower left panel) as well as the types of information\nto display, such as subclasses, superclasses, and relationships (upper left panel). This visualization paradigm is particularly helpful when\nan ontology contains more than one type relationship, since the tree view (left) only shows the ontology classes according to one\nrelationship (is-a).\n40 RUBIN ET AL.\nFig 8. Collaborative Protégé. Protégé supports collaborative ontology editing by permitting users to annotate ontology components as\nwell as ontology changes. It also supports searching and filtering of user annotations based on different criteria. In this screenshot, a user\nhas identified a duplicate term in RadLex and communicates that to the curators by creating an annotation on the term in question\n(“Brodmann area 6”). The term to be annotated is selected (left panel), and annotations are created (right panel) to describe the user’s\nfeedback. The RadLex curator can search, filter, and browse annotations created by the community, and create annotations serving as\nto-do items for incorporating changes and suggestions in future releases of RadLex. This screenshot shows that the curator agrees with\nthe user feedback and creates an annotation reflecting the need for the duplicate term to be removed in the next release of RadLex.\nFig 7. Visualizing RadLex using the TGVizTab plug-in for Protégé. The TGViz plug-in to Protégé displays an ontology as a TouchGraph\n(right panel), enabling the user to navigate the ontology as a nested, zoomable graph. The graph is initially created by selecting a root\nclass from the tree view (upper left panel); the root class is shown in the center of the graph (right panel). Classes are shown as the\nnames of the class, and the relationships between classes are shown as arcs, with the type of relationship appearing when the mouse\npasses over the arcs (upper left part of graph in right panel). Users navigate the ontology by double-clicking on a class name in the graph,\nwhich zooms into that class, producing a new TouchGraph rooted at that class.\nPROTÉGÉ: A TOOL IN RADIOLOGY APPLICATIONS 41\nwhich are best shown using a graph (Fig.6). There\nare several types of ontology visualization compo-\nnents that have been developed for Protégé, two of\nwhich we highlight here in the context of RadLex.\nOntoViz is a plug-in to Protégé that creates\ngraph visualizations of ontologies (http://protege.\ncim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?OntoViz). OntoViz pro-\nduces its graphs using the Graphviz software\npackage.\n13 The types of visualizations are highly\nconfigurable and include ability to (1) visualize\npart of an ontology by selecting specific classes\nand instances, (2) display slots and slot edges, (3)\ncustomize the graph by specifying colors for nodes\nand edges, and (4) visualize the neighborhood of\nclasses for particular classes or instances by applying\nvarious operators (e.g., subclasses, superclasses).\nTGVizTab is a plug-in for Progégé for visual-\nizing ontologies as a TouchGraph, a software\nimplementation for producing an interactive graph\nthat can be navigated by clicking on the nodes and\nedges in the graph. The TouchGraph library has\nbeen modified and integrated into TGVizTab for\nvisualizing ontologies.\n14 TGVizTab is well suited\nfor navigating RadLex, because of the size of the\nterminology: the TouchGraph display provides a\ncompact and graphical way to visualize large\nnumbers of classes (Fig.7). Unlike OntoViz, the\nuser can dynamically navigate the ontology and\ninterrogate each of its components in real time.\nThis visualization paradigm makes the terminolo-\ngy display simple and intuitive.\nCollaborative Ontology Development\nA key challenge for maintaining a large termi-\nnology such as RadLex is to collect and process\nthe feedback from the large community of users.\nThe current model for feedback on terminologies\nand ontologies is for users to contact the devel-\nopers or to post comments to online discussion\nforums. The problem with this approach is that the\nuser feedback is disconnected from the ontology\nunder discussion; it is difficult for the ontology\ndeveloper to keep track of these discussions, to\nprioritize the feedback, and to decide which parts\nof the ontology need updated first.\nCollaborative Protégé\n15 is a recent extension of\nthe Protégé system that supports collaborative\nontology development by enabling the community\nto annotate ontologies. A set of annotation com-\nFig 9. Programmatically interacting with ontologies using the Protégé Script Tab. This screen shot shows some example interactive\ncommands to the Protege API and their results.\n42 RUBIN ET AL.\nponents can be accessed by people viewing\nterminologies such as RadLex, enabling them to\nassociate their comments directly with the parts of\nthe ontology to which they apply. Thus, for\nexample, if a user noticed that there is a duplicate\nterm in RadLex, that person could create an\nannotation on the class in question in which the\nnature of the problem is described (Fig.8). At a\nlater time, the RadLex curator can view the parts\nof the ontology for which users have made\nannotations, either acting on them or making\nannotations on the annotations themselves. All\nannotations can be viewed by the community as\nwell, enabling a dialog on ontologies that is tied to\nthe specific components under discussion. This\nmechanism can streamline the process of acquiring\nand reviewing community feedback on ontologies.\nThe Collaborative Protégé components provide\nsearch and filtering of user annotations based on\ndifferent criteria. There are also two types of voting\nmechanisms that can be used for voting of change\nproposals. All annotations made by one user are seen\nimmediately by other users, enabling a community-\nbased discussion about ontologies to be directly\nlinked to the applicable portions of the ontologies.\nProgramming Interfaces\nDespite the variety of plug-ins available for\nProtégé, many users will have custom needs\nrelated to how they work with ontologies, which\nwill require direct programmatic access to the\nontology content. For example, a RadLex curator\nmay wish to find the classes that have missing\nvalues for slots (currently, many SNOMED and\nUMLS identifiers have not yet been collected for\nRadLex terms). To find these classes in RadLex, a\nprogram would be needed to traverse all classes in\nthe RadLex ontology, looking for those that have\nmissing values for the slots in question.\nProtégé provides two programming interfaces\nthat developers can use to access its ontology\ncontent. The Protégé Script Tab is a plug-in to\nProtégé that provides a scripting environment in\nseveral interpreted languages such as python,\npearl, and ruby ( http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/\nwiki.pl?ProtegeScriptTab). The Script Tab pro-\nvides the simplest and quickest programmatic\naccess to ontologies in Protégé; it accessed via an\nadditional tab in the Protégé GUI into which users\ncan enter commands (Fig.9). The commands will\nbe applied to the ontology currently loaded into\nProtégé. Thus, in our example above, we could\nperform the query to find classes having missing\nvalues for slots by entering a few lines of code into\nthe Script Tab and viewing the results. An example\nof the output of a few simple commands entered\ninto the Script Tab is shown in Figure9.\nIn addition to the Script Tab, Protégé provides an\nAPI. System developers can use the Protégé API, a\nJava interface to access and programmatically\nmanipulate Protégé ontologies— this is the same\nAPI that the Protégé GUI uses to access ontologies\n(Fig. 3). Developers can access the Protege Java\nAPI from their Java programs by calling the appro-\npriate methods to access the ontology in Protégé\nand to perform the desired operations. Documenta-\ntion for guiding developers in using the Protégé API\nfor application and plug-in development is available\n(http://protege.stanford.edu/doc/dev.html).\nAPPLICATIONS\nWhile Protégé is a useful tool for working with\nontologies and terminologies, the ultimate reason\nto be creating these artifacts is to use them in\napplications. For example, if one wanted to use\nRadLex in a structured reporting application to\nenforce use of controlled terminology, it would be\nnecessary for that application to access terms in the\nontology. Protégé can be integrated with many\napplications, connecting external programs to\nontologies via the Protégé API (as described\nabove). In this section, we highlight an example\napplication relevant to RadLex that was created in\nthis manner— WebProtege.\nA large terminology such as RadLex needs to be\nboth widely available and locally editable. A\ncommon method for distributing a terminology is\nvia the Web; however, once a user downloads the\nterminology, it will be become out of date as soon\nas a new version is posted. An alternative method\nfor disseminating RadLex is to provide a Web-\nbased program for viewing the terminology. In\nfact, RadLex is currently made available through a\ndedicated Web application (http://www.radlex.org/\nradlex/). However, because the version of RadLex\nthat is deployed in the Web application is separate\nfrom the working draft, it is challenging to keep\nthe development and production versions of\nRadLex tightly synchronized.\nPROTÉGÉ: A TOOL IN RADIOLOGY APPLICATIONS 43\nAn approach whereby a single version of RadLex\ncould be edited by curators and disseminated on the\nWeb could be advantageous to make a current\nworking draft available. We undertook to implement\nthis strategy by adopting WebProtege, an ontology-\nenabled application built on the Protégé platform.\nThe goal was to distribute Radlex in a Web\napplication while providing the means to keep it\nsynchronized with the version in development.\nWebProtege is an application that allows users\nto share, browse, and edit ontologies using a Web\nbrowser ( http://protege.cim3.ne t/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?\nWebProtege). The WebProtege application pro-\nvides a graphical paradigm similar to the Protégé\nGUI; users can browse ontologies in a Web browser\nin a similar manner to viewing them in Protégé\n(Fig. 10). In addition, users can create and post\ncomments about specific ontology components.\nThe Protégé architecture allows multiple appli-\ncations as well as Protégé itself to access the same\nontology (see Fig. 3). Thus, the maintenance and\ncoordination of the terminology is greatly facili-\ntated, because there need be only one copy of the\nterminology residing in a central location that all\napplications access through the Protégé API. A\nRadLex developer can use the Protégé GUI to edit\nthe terminology, while applications that need\nRadLex use the Protégé API, accessing the same\nversion that the developer has edited, and users\nbrowsing RadLex through WebProtege see the\nsame version of the terminology as well.\nIn addition to the WebProtege application that we\nhave described here, other applications that use\nontologies can be built using similar principles. The\ncommon denominator is that in order for an\napplication to use an ontology, the appropriate\nmethods in the Protégé API are called to get refe-\nrences to classes (terms) and their attributes (slots).\nDISCUSSION\nThe need for terminologies and ontologies in\nradiology is becoming increasingly apparent. Var-\niation in language used in reporting the results of\nimaging studies is a recognized challenge,\n16 which\ncan be mitigated by adopting standard terminolo-\ngies. Radiology educators need a comprehensive\nlexicon for indexing online educational materials.\n6\nRadiology researchers need their data to be\nindexed with terminologies so that search and data\nmining can be more effective. Ontologies can be\nused to create new intelligent Picture Archiving\nand Communication System applications.\n17\nIn general, there are two types of users of\nterminologies: terminology developers and termi-\nnology consumers. The developers of RadLex are\nin the former group, and those wishing to use\nFig 10. RadLex ontology accessed over the Internet using WebProtege. This application provides Web access to ontologies; a single\nontology file can be edited by curators (Fig. 1) and immediately deployed on the Web without needing to update any software\napplications. The ontology is shown on the left, and details about selected terms on the right, similar to that provided by the Protégé\nediting tool (Fig.4).\n44 RUBIN ET AL.\nRadLex or to create applications enabled by\nRadLex are in the latter group. Terminology\ndevelopers need a tool that meets the functional\nrequirements of terminology management:\n/C15Visualization of terminologies: Terminologies\ncan be large. Users need to be able to browse\nterminologies compactly, collapsing entire\ntrees to hide the complexity from users.\nDifferent paradigms for visualization (tree\nview, graph view, etc) are desirable because\ndifferent ways of viewing large terminologies\ncould be preferable under different circum-\nstance (tree views give a good overview of\ntaxonomies; graphs are suitable for displaying\nmultiple relationships among terms).\n/C15Terminology versioning: It is useful to show\nhow terminologies changed between versions.\nTraditional “document diff ” methods that\nshow text differences are not useful for\nterminologies because of their complex struc-\nture. Specialized tools are needed to show\nhow terminologies changed between versions\n(term moving to a different place, being split\ninto two or more new terms, etc).\n/C15User feedback management: User feedback\ndrives the evolution of terminologies. It is diffi-\ncult to keep track of all the requested changes to\na terminology, especially as the volume of\nfeedback expands. Methods are needed to track\nthe type of comments being made, the terms to\nwhich they apply, and whether and how\nfeedback was handled. It is desirable for the\nfeedback to be publicly accessible so that the\ndetails of the evolution of the terminology are\ntransparent to the community.\nTerminology consumers have requirements re-\nlated to terminology dissemination and application\ndevelopment:\n/C15Terminology dissemin ation: Applications\nneed to be able to access the current version\nof the terminology as soon as new versions\nare produced. It can be cumbersome for\ndevelopers of applications that use a terminol-\nogy such as Radlex to keep their version of\nthe terminology current as RadLex evolves; it\nwould be preferable to avoid the need to\nmodify of update applications when new\nversions of the terminology are released.\n/C15Application development: Ultimately, a termi-\nnology is only useful if it can be easily\nincorporated into applications. An application\nshould be able to refe rence terms in the\nterminology using simple methods, and appli-\ncation developers should not need to under-\nstand the arcane details of terminology storage\nformats.\nIn this report, we have described Protégé, an\nopen-source tool that can help users of terminol-\nogies and ontologies to develop them and use them\nin applications. Protégé provides tools to support\nthe functional requirements for terminology devel-\nopers and consumers as described above. The\nProtégé tools range from creating the terminology\n(GUI, visualization, and versioning support) to\ndeployment and application development (user\nfeedback management, API, and application sup-\nport). We have illustrated these functions using\nRadLex as an example terminology. In fact, the\nRadLex project has adopted Protégé for managing\nthe terminology, and Protégé has been useful in\nmeeting the terminology curation needs of the\nRadLex project to date.\nAlthough Protégé provides functionality that\nmeets many needs of the user community, there\nare still some unmet challenges. First, terminol-\nogies evolve over time, and terms that are used\nin applications may be retired in future versions\nof the terminologies. When a term is deleted\nfrom a newer version of the terminology, appli-\ncations that use an older version of the termi-\nnology need to be provided an appropriate\nreplacement term.\nA second challenge is that the compact visual-\nizations provided by Protégé may not be sufficient\nin cases of very large terminologies. Although\nthere are some visualization paradigms for large\nontologies, it could be helpful to filter the termi-\nnology or produce a compact “view” of the on-\ntology specific to context of the user. A final\nchallenge is that users new to terminologies and\nontologies may experience a learning curve in\nbecoming acquainted with the concepts and learn-\ning how to create terminology-enabled applica-\ntions. The Protégé web site contains tutorials and\nintroductory material that can help the community\nget up to speed with this tool and its use in\napplications.\nPROTÉGÉ: A TOOL IN RADIOLOGY APPLICATIONS 45\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by the National Center for\nBiomedical Ontology, under roadmap-initiative grant U54\nHG004028 from the National Institutes of Health.
