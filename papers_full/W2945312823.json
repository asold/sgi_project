INTRODUCTION  \nUnder high penetration of converted-based renewable  DG, \nthe power grid is challenged to maintain safe opera tions in \nterms of voltage and current operative limits. For this reason, \nDistribution System Operators (DSO) need a continuo us \nupgrade of the grid infrastructure, i.e. cable and transformer \nreplacement with larger size ones, that is costly a nd caused \ndisruption to customers. The Smart Transformer (ST) [1-2], a \npower electronics-based transformer, aims to replac e the \nconventional iron transformer in the grid where the  need for \ncontrollability of the grid is high. The ST does not simply adapt \nthe voltage from medium to low voltage grids, but at the same \ntime, can offer ancillary services to the distribut ion grid. As \nshown in the OFGEM-funded project “LV-ENGINE” [3], the \nST integration in the grid can bring up to £60m in savings by \n2030. In Fig. 1, the 3-stage ST architecture is shown. The MV \nconverter controls the AC current absorption, in or der to \nmaintain the nominal voltage in the MV DC link. The DC/DC \nconverter regulates the power flow between the two DC links. \nIn the LV side, the ST converter controls the voltage waveform \nin the grid. This means that the ST is able to vary  amplitude, \nfrequency and phase of the ST-fed LV grid upon requ est of \nservices. In particular, the ST is able to apply co ntrolled \nvoltage and frequency disturbances in the LV grid i n order to \nevaluate the load power sensitivity to voltage and frequency \n[4]. This possibility allows to know how much the l oad \nconsumption will vary, before applying any changes in the \nvoltage amplitude or frequency. It gives the possibility to make \nthe ST-fed grid a controllable resource, as demonstrated in [5], \noffering services like the Soft Load Reduction, that overcomes \nthe classical concept of load shedding, or the ST-b ased \nOverload Control [6], that support the ST hardware during \npeak load periods. The ST, exploiting the load cont rollability, \nis able also to provide services to the transmissio n grid, such \nas supporting the primary frequency support of sync hronous \ngenerators [7]. Controlling downwards or upwards th e power \nconsumption, the ST can increase the system damping , \navoiding large frequency nadir during power imbalances. \nHowever, the On-Line Load sensitivity Identificatio n \n(OLLI) as described in [4] is performed at the ST b usbar and \nit represents the sensitivity of the overall grid. In this paper, we \nwill investigate the possibility to implement the p roposed \nparameter identification methodology in real-time at customer \nlevel, adopting typical metering instrumentation th at could be \nalready available at any industrial or commercial facility, or in \na small microgrid. The methodology is tested using \nmeasurements obtained on the field through affordab le \nmetering devices characterized by a small timestamp  \nresolution and making use of common industrial auto mation \nprotocols (i.e Modbus TCP/IP and RTU). The work’s \noutcomes depict how to characterize the sensitiviti es of a \nspecific load (e.g., household, commercial activity) at the point \nof common coupling with the distribution system ope rator’s \ngrid.  \nThe validation of such methodology is performed \nimplementing the OLLI approach in the power-hardwar e-in-\nthe-loop facility and microgrid at LabZERO (Politec nico di \nBari) [8]. The power output of a ST, simulated in a  real-time \ndigital simulator, is amplified through a 15 kW thr ee-phase \npower module and used to supply energy to the local microgrid \n[9]. Measurements from field components are obtaine d using \nbasic multifunction metering instrumentation characterized by \ngood accuracy but high time resolution (1 second), and \ncollected from the local gateway using Modbus TCP/I P. Both \nLAN/WAN communication architecture or HTTP-based \nsolutions (RESTful API or MQTT) are viable for gath ering \ndata locally or in a centralized fashion.  \nThe paper is structure as follows: Section II recalls the OLLI \n  \nconcept; Section III depicts possible OLLI applicat ions in \ndistribution grids, while Section IV describes the experimental \nfacility used in this work and the experimental res ults carried \nout with different load composition. Finally, Secti on V is \ndedicated to the conclusions. \nII.   ON-LINE LOAD SENSITIVITY IDENTIFICA TION CONCEPT  \nA.   On-line load sensitivity identification (OLLI) \nIn literature, the load models are classified mainl y in \nexponential model and ZIP model (constant impedance , \nconstant current, constant power). Because of its s implicity, \nthe load sensitivity are evaluated in this work wit h the \nexponential load described in (1), that allows to e stimate only \none parameter (i.e. pK ): \n \n0\n0\n0\n0\np\nq\nK\nK\nVP P V\nVQ Q V\n  = ⋅     \n  = ⋅     \n (1) \nwhere P, Q, V, P0, Q0, V0 are respectively the measured and the \nnominal active and reactive power, and voltage; pK  is the load \nactive power sensitivity to voltage. Rearranging th e equations \nand estimating the sensitivity at the operating point 0V V = , the \nload sensitivity to voltage in the i-th operating point can be \nexpressed as: \n \ni\np\ni\ni\nq\ni\ndP P KdV V \ndQ Q \nKdV V \n=\n=\n  (2) \nThe equations (2) can be thus discretized in a certain instant \n\u0001\u0002 obtaining: \n \n1 1 \n1 1 \n1 1 \n1 1 \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) \n( ) ( ) ,( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) \n( ) ( ) \nk k k k \nk k \np q \nk k k k \nk k \nP t P t Q t Q t \nP t P t K K V t V t V t V t \nV t V t \n− − \n− − \n− − \n− − \n− − \n= = − −   (3) \nwhere 1( ) kP t − , ( ) kP t , 1( ) kQ t − , ( ) kQ t , 1( ) kV t −  and ( ) kV t  are  \nthe load active power and voltage at a certain inst ant 1kt −  and \nthe following one kt . It must be noted, that the sensitivity is \nestimated independently from the load model adopted, but it is \nbased only on the power and voltage measurement. \nTo evaluate the load sensitivity, the ST applies a controlled \nvoltage disturbance, as shown in Fig. 2, and measur ing the \nactive and reactive power variation is able to compute the load \nsensitivity applying Eq. (3). \n \nAt a certain instant kt , the ST applies a voltage variation, \nsamples the voltage, active and reactive power meas urement \nand compare them with the measurement of the previo us \ninstant 1kt − . With the current and previous measurements, the \nST computes the active and reactive power sensitivi ty to \nvoltage at the instant kt  using Eq. (3). During each instant kt , \nthe OLLI computes the new sensitivity, averaging th e \nsensitivities in the first k instants for the number of the ramp \ntime-steps: \nCommercial \nLoad \nDistributed \nGenerator \nResidential \nLoad \nST \n0.96 \nVoltage (pu)\nTime \nLV grid \n0.96 \nTime \nGrid Power \n(p.u.) \n11\n0.98 \n \nFig. 2.

Parti cularly \nthe latter can be affected by the propagation of the errors in the \nproduct of the measured current and voltage. Furthermore, the \nload shows power stochastic noise, that belongs to fast \nswitching of small loads or fast generation changes . This \npower noise does not cause a noticeable change in t he overall \nload sensitivity, but it may affect the sensitivity  estimation, \ninfluencing the instantaneous sensitivity calculation. In case of \nsensitivity estimation at the ST busbar, this probl em can be \nsolved exploiting the fast measurement system (sampling time \n>5kHz) and high computational capability of the ST control \nboard to remove the noise from the sensitivity calc ulation. \nHowever, this is not possible in case of industrial metering due \nto standard measurement dynamics (about 1s sampling  time) \nand limited computation capability of the measurement control \nboard. For these reasons, in this work the following rules have \nbeen applied to remove the noise in the industrial metering-\nbased OLLI approach. \nConsidering the power variation in per-unit at each  k-th \ntime step:  \n \n1\n1\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) \nk k \nk\nk\nP t P t P t P t \n−\n−\n−∆ =  (5) \nthe power variation can be calculated considering t he voltage \nvariation measurement and the current load sensitiv ity \ncoefficient calculated as shown in Eq. (4). For example for the \nactive power sensitivity to voltage, the expected p ower is \ncalculated as: \n \n( ) ( ) ( ) exp k p k k P t K t V t ∆ = ⋅ ∆  (6) \nA wrong power variation measurement can be discharged if \nthe variation does not match the expected power var iation \nwithin a certain tolerance ε. For this reason the  following rule \nis applied: \n \n( ) ( ) \n( ) ( ) \nk exp k \nk p k avg \nif P t P t \nthen \nP t K t V \nε∆ − ∆ > \n∆ = ⋅ ∆ \n (7) \nthe value of the tolerance \u0003 varies depending on the voltage \nvariation slope. Here the tolerance \u0003 = 0.01pu  is adopted. The \nupdated power variation is, thus, evaluated taking into account \nthe current sensitivity coefficient ( ) p k K t  and the average \npower variation along the ramp avg V∆ , calculated as: \n 1\n( ) \nk\ni\ni\navg \nV t \nV k\n=\n∆\n∆ = \n\n (8) \nAs will be shown in Section IV.B, the relation in (7) allows \nto reject power disturbances that do not belong to the base load, \nbut they are caused by measurement errors or fast p ower \nvariations that are not of interest. \nIII.   APPLICA TIONS OF OLLI  IN DISTRIBUTION GRID  \nThrough the proposed OLLI approach, an on-line \nsensitivity index of voltage dependency can be asso ciated to \nany electrical system or subsystem behind a power m eter, \nprovided that the meter has access to a communicati on \nnetwork (directly or through a gateway). The availa bility of \nsuch index can allow several possible application w ith regard \nto (centralized) utility-based or (local) end users-based energy \nmanagement routines. \nA.   Utility-based applications \nSmart distribution grids require advanced modeling \ncapabilities for system analysis and control. Typically, end-use \nloads are represented with time-invariant statistic al ZIP \nmodels, whereas in smart grids, time-series simulations should \nbe characterized by step-sizes down to the order of  few \nminutes [10]. The most straightforward application of the \nproposed method relies in providing advanced updated models \nof physical nodes or portions of the network. Refin ed and \nupdated models can be used in any kind of SCADA/DMS  \napplication such as distribution unbalanced load fl ow, \ndistribution optimal power flow and assessment of power grid \ncontrol actions and reconfiguration [11]. \nIn particular, the knowledge of load-voltage depend ence \npermits to overcome the crucial technical barriers for an \neffective implementation of Conservation Voltage Re duction \n(CVR) [12], including the assessment and verification of CVR \neffects, and the possible effects of distributed generation. It has \nbeen recently demonstrated that the distribution gr id load is \nstill sensitive to voltage variation, as shown in t he “CLASS” \nproject [13]. The load response to voltage variatio n has been \nfound being often superlinear, with several MV feed ers close \nto a quadratic response (constant impedance load) [ 14]. The \nproposed OLLI approach allows to generate time-vary ing \nequivalent load models of portions of the network, overcoming \nusual representations that use same models for enti re \nsubsystems. This more detailed representation allow s to \nimplement CVR in Adaptive Voltage Control routines,  or \nmore in general, in secondary distribution Volt-Var  \nOptimization tools [15]. Knowing voltage (or even frequency) \nsystem dependence of subsystems can help minimizing  \ncontrolling effort during congestions since the mos t sensitive \nloads can be curtailed though voltage reduction, wh ereas less \nsensitive ones could be just entirely switched off. \nTheoretically, the proposed approach can be impleme nted \non an AMI-based platform [16], detecting response of loads at \nend-user level, instead of just substation or street control panel \nlevel. The OLLI approach does not require significa nt \ncomputation effort and sensitivities calculations could be made \n  \nlocally. The main concern would rather rely on the \ncoordination of the large amount of incoming data [10].  \nB.   End-users applications \nCVR techniques can be used at end-user level for pe ak \nshaving or other demand side management functions. This \nkind of practice is already employed for load contr ol in large \ncommercial buildings like malls or supermarkets. Cl early, the \nknowledge of voltage sensitivities can allow a bett er \ncoordination of voltage control and load curtailment.  \nA very interesting application of the proposed OLLI  \ntechnique could be found in the operation of critic al power \nsystems such the ones that supply large industrial plants, as for \nexample refineries and petrochemical plants. In suc h systems, \nload shedding techniques are employed in normal operation in \na 15-30 minutes control frame in order to control t ie-lines or \navoid critical operating points, where for example not enough \nspinning reserve is guaranteed in case of major fau lts [17]. \nEmergency load shedding is also a frequently employ ed \ncontrol action whenever a system separation is caus ed by \nexternal perturbations, usually a fault or very str ong voltage \ndips on the main grid. In such case, automatic isla nding \nprocedure can be triggered in a very short time (le ss than \n500ms), since these kind of plants have often a rel evant inner \ngeneration power capacity.  \nDepending on the plant configuration, system adequa cy \ncannot be always ensured and load might have to be shed. At \nSCADA/EMS level, the amount of load to be shed in c ase of \nsystem separation is calculated continuously, based  on active \nproduction processes, generation reserve and system operating \nstate. Being able to serve as much load as possible  is of utter \nimportance since any interruption to critical loads  can cause \nthe stop of a process and the activation of emergen cy \nshutdown. As an example, in the case of a petrochemical plant, \nthe shutdown of the cracking process implies, not only the loss \nof material, but also the activation of safety flaring procedures, \nwith great impacts on the environment and social acceptability.  \nIn both cases, the right amount of load to be shed could be \ncalculated considering also the possibility to curtail some of it \nthrough a voltage reduction on a specific feeder (b oth ST-\nbased or ULTC-based operation could be possible of course). \nMoreover, in [18], it was showed how the assessment  of \ntransient stability during emergency islanding is s trongly \naffected by the load model used for simulation. Fur thermore, \nit has been shown in [19-20], that modeling of indu ction \nmotors and frequency dependent loads play an import ant role \nfor preserving voltage stability in stressed system s. The OLLI \nupdated indexes can clearly provide the SCADA/EMS w ith \nmore appropriate dynamic models for transient simulations. \nC.   Requirements for on-line implementation \nAs previously remarked, for any of the possible approaches, \nbeing centralized utility or local end-user based, power \nmeasurements from meters must be made available to a central \ncomputation unit. The easiest implementation, since  most of \nthe commercially available power meters for industr ial \napplication are intelligent electronic devices (IED s), is to \nexploit the network capabilities of the meters. The se meters \ncould directly interfaced to a Local Area Network (LAN) or to \na wider network (WAN), depending on the scale of th e \napplication. In such cases connection-less communic ation via \nIP-based protocols can allow and easy share of data. This is the \nactual case of the experimental results presented i n this paper \nthat have been based on studying the OLLI feasibili ty on a \nModbus TCP/IP architecture, with a communication through a \nLAN. However, whenever a physical network interconnecting \nmeters with a central SCADA or controller is not av ailable, \npossible implementations could be based on HyperTex t \nTransfer Protocol (HTTP)-based communication, devel oping \na web server applications or collecting data in a cloud platform \nthough an Application Programming Interface (API). These \napproaches are possible if data must be collected o r processed \nby an external entity such as a virtual power plant  or an \naggregator.  \nTwo parameters that could affect the performance of  the \nproposed approach are the time resolution of power meters and \nthe latency of the adopted communication network. T he \ndynamic profile of the voltage perturbation applied  by the ST \nmust be suitably chosen with respect to the time re solution of \nthe meters. For example a voltage ramp faster than the time \nresolution could not be read by the meters. It was found that \nmost of the ordinary industrial power meters have a  time \nresolution stamp of about one second. This mean tha t the \nvoltage perturbation must be much slower than the one used in \n[4] where measurements were taken directly at ST-level by the \nST control board. \nLatency can also affect the methodology since the m aster \nrequest for a measurement could theoretically reach  the slave \nmeter in an untimely manner (and vice versa). Howev er, as \nremarked in the next paragraph, communication latency can be \nassessed in few hundreds of milliseconds for both WAN-based \nand HTTP-based applications. Given the assumed orde r \nmagnitude for measurement time resolution (no more than one \nmeasure per second), these values are small enough to \nintroduce a negligible effect. \nIV.   E\nXPERIMENTAL V ALIDA TION IN A SMART GRID LAB  \nThe tests were carried out exploiting the power-har dware-\nin-the-loop (PHIL) facility at LabZERO (Politecnico  di Bari) \n[9]. The PHIL system is composed by a real time dig ital \nsimulator (RTDS) OPAL RT OP5600 connected to the 16 kW \n4-quadrants programmable power source Triphase \nPM15A30F60, with 6-channel output to be used in various AC \nand DC configurations [21]. In its normal configura tion at \nLabZERO, a 4-wire AC power output is used. The powe r \nsource exchanges power with the local microgrid switchboard. \nThe microgrid is composed by several microsources such a \nPV generator, a wind turbine and a small scale biom ass \ncombined cycle plant. Moreover, a LiFePO4 Battery E nergy \n  \nStorage System is installed, together with several loads. \nIn Fig. 3, a simplified scheme of the power and \ncommunication system of LabZERO is given. Please note that \nmost of the devices represented in the figure are c ommercial \navailable automation products. The main switchboard , \nrepresented in the upper part of the figure, suppli es directly \nenergy to the laboratory offices, where also the PH IL system \nis installed. The main switchboard is then linked t o the \nmicrogrid through a cable of about 120m, covering t he \ndistance between two non-adjacent separate building s. An \nanalogous link allows to transfer the power output of the \nprogrammable power source to the microgrid. \nIn the microgrid, energy resources are connected to  the \nswitchboard through a remote-controlled switch. Eac h feeder \nis monitored through a power meter PM3255, whereas a \nPM5560 is used at the main microgrid switch, which \nrepresents the point of common coupling of the microgrid. All \nthese meters are on the same Modbus RS-485 bus and are then \nconnected to the laboratory LAN through an Ethernet gateway \n(EGX300). An optical fiber link is used to connect the \nmicrogrid local Ethernet switch to the main switch located at \nthe LabZERO offices. A similar structure (RS-485 se rial bus, \nEthernet gateway and switch) is used to connect all  power \nmeters at the LAN.  \nAn Energy Server Com’X210 collects the data from al l \nModbus TCP/Modbus serial line gateways and enables data \nlogging and reporting functions such as a web serve r. A PLC \nis also used to provide a HMI interface and further monitoring \nand control functions such as alarms, switch operat ion and \nremote control, network topology, BESS control. For the sake \nof simplicity, the communication infrastructure rel ated to all \nthese other signals is not represented in the simpl ified scheme \n(Fig. 3). \nThe tests, that implied the study of the response o f loads to \nvoltage perturbations, were carried out separating the \nmicrogrid from the main switchboard (i.e. the main switch \nbeside the PM5560 on the left of Fig. 3 is switched  off), and \nsupplying the microgrid through the power amplifier operating \nin voltage source control mode. Thus, the time varying voltage \noutput of a Smart Transformer is simulated and appl ied \nthrough the programmable power source to the microgrid.  \nThe response of a variable set of loads to voltage profiles \nwere recorded and studied using a common PC connect ed to \nthe LAN and the Modbus Master emulator of Matlab \nInstrument Control Toolbox. All adopted meters are able to \nmake power measurements available on the LAN networ k, \nusing a Modbus TCP/IP protocol (either directly if Modbus \nTCP/IP is supported by the equipment or via an Ethe rnet \ngateway). Data were read from the holding registers  of slaves \nand logged, using the minimum time resolution possi ble with \nthis set-up (about 100 ms). However, such resolutio n is not \nneeded since the power meters update their reading only after \none second. \nIf these data must be read or analyzed by a central ized \noperator, being either a DSO or an energy services aggregator, \nthe holding registers of Modbus TCP/IP meters can b e \naccessed from any master located in a wide area net work \n(WAN). If this is not possible, or economically viable, data can \nbe collected by a local gateway and published utilizing HTTP-\nbased applications like RESTful API or MQTT API. Th e \nexperimental results in the development of a cloud based \nenergy management system [22], showed a latency ass ociated \nwith the transfer of real-time data using a WAN of about \n100 ms [8]; whereas in the case of a MQTT API the o verall \n \n \nFig. 3.  Power and communication scheme of the LabZERO  power -hardware -in -the -loop test facility at the Politecnico di Bari  \n\n  \ndelay was about 100 ms comprehensive of the time ne cessary \nto build the message to be published. Both timings are \ncompatible with the assumed 1 s resolution. \nA.   Experimental validation \nThe analysis of the sensitivity in the studied micr ogrid has \nbeen performed applying to the LabZERO microgrid \ncontinuous voltage variations of 0.02pu with a ramp  of 5s and \na steady-state time of 5s. The controlled voltage v ariation has \na total time window of 15s.  \nThe sensitivity analysis is carried out considering  4 test \ncases, characterized by the presence on the monitor ed feeder \nof some small loads. The rationale under this choice is to prove \nhow the methodology can be applied also with minor load \nvariations. The proposed cases are the following: \nCase A:  Electrical heater consuming 800W; this is the \ntypical constant impedance load case, depending \non the square of the voltage; \nCase B:  Electrical heater consuming 800W and household \nelectrical appliance (i.e., desktop computer); the \nlatter, being power electronics-interfaced with the \ngrid, has the tendency to behave as constant power \nload; \nCase C:  Same as Case 2, but the electrical heater reduces \nthe power consumption to 400W, decreasing the \nconstant impedance contribution of the total load; \nCase D:  Same as Case 2 but with a small power tool (i.e. a \nheat gun) of about 400W also connected; it \nrepresents the case of small electrical appliances. \nThe overall experimental test voltage and power profiles are \nplotted in Fig. 4 and each of the aforementioned te st cases are \nmarked with a black box in the figure. \n \nCase A:  The ST applies a controlled voltage variation as \nshown in Fig. 5 and, being the load passive, the active responds \naccordingly to a squared relation with the voltage.  The \nestimated load sensitivity K\np=1.98 in accordance with the \nconstant impedance nature of the load. As can be no ted from \nFig.5, the estimated power profile matches almost perfectly the \nmeasured power in both analyzed voltage variations. \n \nTo understand the working of the OLLI algorithm, the voltage \nsensitivity for each instant t\u0002 is plotted in Fig. 6. During the \nevaluation time window, the OLLI gives a sensitivit y \ncontribution that depends on the instantaneous acti ve power \nand voltage measurements. As can be noted, the sens itivity in \neach instant is in the neighborhood of the estimated Kp=1.98. \n \nCase B:  A typical constant power load (desktop computer) is \nconnected in the grid, introducing more noise in th e power \nprofile, as can be seen from Fig. 7. The power has been \nnormalized at the beginning of the time window, sho wing \nalthough, fast power variations. The OLLI algorithm  has \nevaluated the load sensitivity to voltage equal to Kp=2.02. \nDespite the introduction of a constant power load, the \nsensitivity shows still a constant impedance behavi or. This is \ndue to the limited demand of constant power load an d to the \npresence of some load fluctuations during the turning on of the \n \nFig. 4.  Voltage (blue, pu) and power (read, kW) profile of the investigated \nload, in 12 minutes time window.  \n \nFig. 5.  Measured voltage (blue) and power (red) of  the load in Case A, \nand estimated power consumption with the obtained l oad sensitivity to \nvoltage. \n \nFig. 6.  Contribution in each instant tk of the load active power sensitivity \nKp, in Case A.  \n\n  \nPC. However, the approximation given by the propose d \napproach can be considered still acceptable as in Fig. 7.  \n \nCase C:  To reduce the impact of the constant impedance \ncontribution in the analyzed load, the electrical h eater power \nconsumption is then reduced to 50%, working at the operating \npoint of 400W. As result, the total load is less se nsitive to \nvoltage variation than in the Case B, with an evalu ated \nsensitivity equal to Kp=1.74 (Fig. 8). Compared to previous \none, Case B is less sensitive to random load fluctu ations. The \nintroduction of a new load of different nature (con stant power \ninstead of constant impedance) is now evident. \n \nCase D:  As final case, a small power tool load is added to the \nloads depicted in Case B. Comparing Fig. 9 and Fig.  7 can be \nnoted that the load is less sensitive to voltage variation, varying \nthe power consumption in less than square way with respect to \nvoltage. The estimate sensitivity is Kp=1.81. The index Kp \ndecreased value can be explained by the power elect ronics \ncontrol of the small power tool, which is less sens itive to \nvoltage variations. \n \nB.   Rejection of power noise \nTo validate the performance of the OLLI under high noise \ncondition, a source of noise, i.e., an Uninterrupti ble Power \nSupply (UPS), has been connected to the grid in Cas e D, \nsupplying an auxiliary circuit of about 150W. The U PS, \ndespite processing low power, for synchronization p urpose, \ninjects a pulsating power in the grid, about every 15 seconds, \nas shown in Fig. 10. The OLLI algorithm recognizes that these \nspikes create power variations very different from the averaged \nvoltage sensitivity of the load, and consequently filters out the \nspikes contributions.  \n \nIn Fig. 11, it can be noticed that the OLLI algorit hm \nrecognizes the power spike during the sensitivity a nalysis and \nrejects this contribution, on the basis of the powe r noise \nrejection rule in Eq. (7). \n \nFig. 7.  Measured voltage (blue) and power (red) of  the load in Case B, \nand estimated power consumption with the obtained l oad sensitivity to \nvoltage. \n \nFig. 8.

CONCLUSIONS  \nThe On-Line Load sensitivity Identification allows a real \ntime identification of the load power sensitivity to voltage and \nfrequency. In this paper, the identification has been performed \nusing commercially available industrial metering de vices, \ncharacterized by a relatively high timestamp resolution.  \nTo validate the industrial metering-based approach,  \nexperimental results were obtained in a small micro grid setup \nand having modeled the power output of the Smart \nTransformer with a programmable power source. Throu gh the \nproposed tests, the load sensitivity was correctly identified at \nend-user level, using measurements with a 1-second time \nresolution at the point of common coupling with the  grid. The \nmeasurements were collected in a LAN using common \ncommunication protocols, such as Modbus TCP/IP. \nExperimental data confirms the possibility to exten d the same \nmethodology to WAN or HTTP-based cloud applications. \nResults showed that the OLLI method correctly ident ifies \nthe load sensitivity, even when very small power de viations \nare measured. Furthermore, in this paper, a simple rule for \nrejecting bad data due to noise and power fluctuations has been \nproposed and tested with experimental results.  \nA\nCKNOWLEDGMENT  \nThe research leading to these results has received funding \nfrom the European Research Council under the Europe an \nUnion’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) / \nERC Grant Agreement n.
