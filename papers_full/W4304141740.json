SSTs \ncan be utilized for the interface of different types (AC \nor DC) of buses with differ ent ratings. In most cases, \nthe core of an SST is a dual active bridge (DAB) \n                                                       \n \nManuscript received May 16, 2022; revised July 7, 2022; accepted July 27, \n2022. Date of publication September 30, 2022; date of current version August 22, 2022. \n* Corresponding Author, E-mail: sunwei198677@hotmail.com \nDigital Object Identifier: 10.23919/CJEE.2022.000023 \n \nconverter [2]. The isolation transformer in the DAB has \na high frequency owing to the switching of the active \nbridge converters on the primary and secondary sides, \nmaking the isolation transformer much smaller in size \nthan the 50 Hz or 60 Hz transformer. This is the most \nevident advantage of SSTs. In addition, the active \nswitching control of the power electronic converter \ncan make the interface function flexible and \ncontrollable.  \nThe original concept of an SST was proposed a few \ndecades ago; however, without fast and reliable \nswitching power electronic devices, its application has \nbeen challenging\n [1] . In the last two decades, the \ndevelopment of fast switching insulated gate bipolar \ntransistors (IGBTs) and metal-oxide-semiconductor \nfield-effect transistors (MOSFETs), particularly wide \nbandgap devices, has made the development of SSTs \nmuch faster. In microgrids for renewable energy \napplications and independent power systems in \nshipboard and traction, SSTs can be used for interfaces \nat different power levels with flexible control \ncapability\n [3-4]. Different topologies of active controlled \nprimary and secondary converters can be applied to \noptimize electromagnetic stress on high-frequency \ntransformers\n [5].  \n 2096-1529 © 2022 China Machinery Industry Information Institute \n Dong Jiang et al.: Common-mode El ectromagnetic Interference Mitigation for Solid-state Transformers \n \n23 \nAlthough SSTs have led to significant progress in \npower density and control flexibility, the application of \nactive switching power electronics also introduces \nsome new issues over regular line frequency \ntransformers. One of the most serious drawbacks of \nSSTs compared with conventional transformers is the \nelectromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by \nhigh-frequency switching\n [6-17] . The switching of \npower electronic devices on either side of the \nhigh-frequency transformer introduces high-frequency \nexcitation in the system and generates high-frequency \nEMI current and radiation. Parasitic parameters in the \ncomplex physical system of the SST hardware result in \na complex EMI propagation path. EMI couples with \nthe sensitive parts of the SST system and compromises \nthe system reliability. For the source and load, the EMI \ngenerated by SSTs is also a serious problem. EMI \nstandards have been developed to regulate the \napplication of power electr onic converters on either \nthe source (grid) or the load side.  \nCommon-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) \nEMI can be analyzed using the propagation paths. CM \nEMI propagates in a unified direction in the main \ncircuit and through parasitic parameters to the ground. \nBecause CM EMI is highly affected by parasitic \nparameters in the system layout, it is usually more \ndifficult to analyze. In ad dition, because CM EMI is \nconducted through the non-ideal part of the \ncomponents, the negative impact on the system \nreliability can be more serious.  \nSince SST is a new technology, the major study area \nfor this converter is with topology, architecture, \noperation, and control. Although EMI poses a serious \nissue, studies on EMI in SST s have been limited in \nrecent years. A preliminary study of EMI mitigation \nfor SSTs was conducted using conventional passive \nEMI filter components with snubber capacitors, X and \nY caps, and a CM choke\n [6] . A CM EMI model for \nSSTs should be developed using the parasitic \nparameters in the system\n [7] to understand the CM EMI \nproblem. \nWith more freedom in converter topologies on the \nSST primary and secondary sides, the active \nmitigation of EMI is possible. With a three-level active \nneutral-point-clamped converter on the primary side, \nthe active commutation sequence and system layout \ncan help mitigate the voltage ringing and EMI, \nparticularly the CM current\n [8-9] . With an optimal \nshielding design, the EMI in high-frequency SSTs can \nbe reduced  [10] . Using the SST high-frequency \nimpedance model, the ringing caused by switching can \nbe analyzed, and the EMI caused by ringing can be \nmitigated\n [11].   \nUsing the CM impedance model for the SST system, \na CM filter can be designed to reduce the CM current [12]. \nThe CM choke is assumed to be the most effective CM \nfilter for each cell of the SST; however, it brings extra \nsize and weight to the system. Canceling the CM voltage \nthrough pulse width modulation (PWM) in each phase is \nfeasible for motor drives\n [13]. For SSTs, the combination \nof CM voltage in the phase legs is different, and few \nprior studies have considered this issue.  \nThe mitigation method on the source side can help \nreduce the requirement of CM chokes. A typical \nmethod is the switching frequency variation, which \ncan help spread the EMI peak to a wider range in the \nfrequency domain\n [14-18] . Random PWM is a \nrepresentative method that randomly varies the \nswitching frequency. Consequently, the EMI peak can \nbe reduced. However, for DAB applications, the \nswitching frequency variation should also consider the \npower fluctuation to ensure that the DC voltage is \nstable\n [14] . In addition to random variation, periodic \nvariation can help reduce EMI, along with predictable \nripple\n [16-18]. For AC/DC power conversion, the impact \nof switching frequency periodic variation has been \nstudied theoretically\n [17-18] . However, for a DAB or \nSST, further analysis is required before application. \nAnother active EMI mitigation method is the active \nEMI filter (AEF), which uses an active compensation \ncomponent to cancel the EMI instead of a passive \nfilter\n [19-21] . The AEF samples and actively \ncompensates for the original EMI noise in the system. \nTherefore, it can be decoupled from the main power of \nthe converter. Moreover, its size can be relatively \nsmall for high-power applications, particularly for CM \nEMI filters. Applying the AEF to SSTs can also be a \nfeasible solution to reduce the filter size and weight.  \nIn summary, CM EMI mitigation in SSTs is an \nimportant but relatively new area of research. The \nprimary approach to CM EMI mitigation can adopt \nideas from motor drives and other converters. This \nChinese Journal of Electrical Engineering, V ol.8, No.3, September 2022 \n \n24\npaper discusses a comprehensive study of CM EMI \nmitigation. Section 2 introduces the modeling of the \nCM EMI of SSTs as the basis for mitigation. Section 3 \npresents a coupled inductor as an approach to a \npassive CM filter. Section 4 discusses active EMI \nmitigation methods for SSTs, with the variable \nswitching frequency PWM and AEFs as the primary \nrepresentatives. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the \nconclusions.    \n2  Modeling of CM EMI for SSTs  \n2.1  Description of the DAB and CM EMI problem \nBecause of its inherent advantages, such as modular \nsymmetrical structure, high power density, galvanic \nisolation, soft switching,  and bidirectional energy \ntransmission, DAB is a common topology for the power \ntransmission stage of SSTs. Fig. 1 shows a circuit \nschematic of the DAB prototype. The DAB converter \nconsists of primary and secondary full bridges, a \nhigh-frequency transformer T (transformer ratio n=1:1 in \nthis study), and a phase-shift inductor L\nph. \n \nFig. 1  Circuit schemati c of the DAB prototype \nIt is necessary to clarify the test conditions and derive \na detailed high-frequency model of the converter to \nanalyze the CM EMI mechanism in the DAB. Fig. 2 \nshows the high-frequency DAB model, where a line \nimpedance stabilization network (LISN) is used to \nmeasure CM EMI. The LISN was placed between the \npower supply V\n1 and the DAB to examine the influence \nof interference on power supply network V1. \n \nFig. 2  High-frequency model of th e DAB with parasitic parameters \nFig. 2 shows the main parasitic parameters involved in \nthe CM interference path. First, the stray capacitances of \nthe switching modules are the main paths for CM \nconduction. For example, the power module is a 1.2 \nkV/300 A SiC power MOSFET module of \nCAS300M12BM2 from Cree Inc. The stray capacitances \nC\nP, CN, and C O of each SiC MOSFET module can be \nmeasured using impedance analysis. In addition, the stray \ncapacitances of the high-frequency transformer are the \nmain paths of CM conduction. With a high-power density \ndesign, the interwinding capacitance C\nps of the \ntransformer is relatively large. It forms a displacement \ncurrent under the excitation of high dv/dt of the windings, \ndeteriorating CM EMI. In this study, the transformer is \nequivalent to a lumped model. The stray capacitances can \nbe fitted by testing the open-circuit and short-circuit \nimpedances with an impedance analyzer\n [22-23] . The \ncomplex parasitic parameters and high dv/dt of the DAB \nresult in serious CM EMI problems. \n2.2  CM EMI noise separation and calculation \nThe substitution theorem was applied to derive the CM \nequivalent model of the DAB. S2, S4, S6, and S8 were \nreplaced with equivalent voltage sources. Capacitors \nC\n1 and C 2 were sufficiently large such that C1 and C 2 \ncan be regarded as short circuits. Based on the above \nassumptions, the CM equivalent model of the DAB \nwas obtained, as shown in Fig. 3. \n \nFig. 3  CM equivalent model of the DAB \n Dong Jiang et al.: Common-mode El ectromagnetic Interference Mitigation for Solid-state Transformers \n \n25 \n () ()LISN LISN2 LISN1LISN\n0\n||\n2\nwireLL C CZZ Z R Z\nZ\n++ +\n=  (1) \n PN P N 22CC C=+  (2) \nSubsequently, the CM noise was analyzed using the \nsuperposition theory.

Consequently, \nthe CM noise of the DAB is primarily caused by the \nDM voltages \nVDMP and VDMS with SPS. Furthermore, \nCM EMI was introduced owing to the asymmetry of \nthe DAB circuit. \n3  Passive CM filter by coupled inductor  \nUsing passive components (filters) to impede the \npropagation of EMI is a routine solution to EMI \nmitigation. Integrating an EMI filter with an existing \ncomponent is a new method to increase the power \ndensity. This section introduces passive CM filter \nintegration with a phase-shift inductor in the DAB.   \n3.1  CM filter by discre te symmetrical inductors \nTo mitigate the CM noise caused by the DM voltages of \nthe bridges without changing the power transmission \ncharacteristics, the phase-shifted inductor was split into \ntwo equal halves; these symmetrical inductors were \nconnected in series with each rail of the transformer, as \nshown in Fig. 7. To prevent magnetic saturation, two \ndiscrete inductors were made of a sendust toroid with \nlow permeability, as shown in Fig. 8. Tab. 1 lists the \nparameters of the discrete inductor. \n \nFig. 7  DAB with uncoupled symmetrical inductors \n \nFig. 8  Two discrete symmetrical inductors \nTab. 1  Parameters of discrete inductor \nParameter Value \nInductance/μH 204 \nMagnetic permeability 26 μ0 \nEffective cross-sectional area/cm2 1.44 \nEffective mean path length/cm 14.3 \nNumber of turns 78 \nWith discrete symmetrical inductors, the CM EMI \ndecomposition circuits was derived, as shown in Fig. 9. \nOwing to the symmetrical circuit structure, the \nprimary and secondary DM voltages only form a \ncirculating current through the transformer network, \nand no CM current is generated. The primary source of \nCM EMI is the CM voltage of the bridge. Therefore, \nthe CM current is significantly suppressed by SPS. \n \nFig. 9  CM EMI decomposition circuits with discrete \nsymmetrical inductors \nAs shown in Fig. 5, with the traditional phase-shift \ninductor structure, the phase-shift inductor is bypassed, \nand the entire propagation path is capacitive. However, \nif the phase-shift inductor is split into two discrete \ninductors, a large equivalent inductance \nLeq1≈100 μH \nis introduced into the propagation path, as shown in \nFig. 9b, aggravating the CM EMI problem.  \nFig. 10 shows the CM impedance spectra of the \nphase-shift inductor and transformer. When the \ntraditional phase-shift induct or structure was used, the \nresonant frequency of the transformer and phase-shift \ninductor was relatively high (9.15 MHz), determined \nby the leakage inductance and parasitic capacitance \nCps of the transformer itself. When symmetrical \ninductors were used, the resonance frequency was \nsignificantly reduced to 706 kHz. The CM voltage of \nthe bridge arms excites a large CM current near the \n Dong Jiang et al.: Common-mode El ectromagnetic Interference Mitigation for Solid-state Transformers \n \n27 \nresonant frequency. \n \nFig. 10  CM impedance spectrum  of the phase-shift inductor \nand transformer \n3.2  CM filter by coupl ed symmetrical inductor \nThe uncoupled symmetrical inductors suppress the \nCM current caused by the DM voltages of the bridge \narms; however, they introduce low-frequency \nresonance, increasing the CM current caused by the \nCM voltages. To solve this problem, a coupled \nsymmetrical inductor was used to mitigate the CM \ncurrent, as shown in Fig. 11. Using the coupled \nsymmetrical inductor, the CM EMI decomposition \ncircuits was derived, as shown in Fig. 12. \n \nFig. 11  DAB with coupled symmetrical inductor \n \nFig. 12  CM EMI decompositi on circuits with coupled \nsymmetrical inductors \nCompared with that of discrete symmetrical \ninductors, the propagation path of the coupled \ninductors remains symmetrical, suppressing the CM \ncurrent introduced by the DM voltages of the bridge arms. \nHowever, the equivalent inductance \nLeq2 of the coupled \ninductor is significantly smaller than that of the discrete \ninductors, which exhibits a better mitigation effect. In this \nstudy, the coupled inductor was made of the same \nmaterial as that of the discrete inductors.  \nThe equivalent inductance \nLeq2 of the coupled \ninductor is the leakage inductance, which is \nsignificantly affected by winding distribution. This \nstudy compares the equivalent inductances and CM \ncurrent reductions of the two winding structures. The \ntwo coupled inductor structures are shown in Fig. 13. \nLc1 is a common CM inductor winding structure. The \ntwo windings are wound symmetrically along the \nmagnetic core. In \nLc2, the two banks of the windings \nare wound evenly al ong the entire magnetic core.

Consequently, the resonant \nfrequencies of the coupled inductors and transformer \nincreased, particularly that of the coupled inductor \nLc2 \n(6.68 MHz). This can reduce the CM EMI spikes at \nlow frequencies. \n3.3  Experiment verification \nTo validate the proposed CM filter using a coupled \nsymmetrical inductor, expe riments were performed \nwith an experimental platform, as shown in Fig. 15. \nTab. 3 lists the main system parameters. The DAB \nadopted SPS modulation, and the voltage conversion \nratio was set to 1 to realize soft switching. In the next \nfew parts, the experiments for active CM EMI \nmitigation methods were also performed using the \nsame hardware testbed as that for the DAB.  \n \nFig. 15  Experimental platform of the DAB \nTab. 3  Main system parameters of the DAB \nParameter Value \nSwitching frequency/kHz 10 \nTransformer ratio 1:1 \nV1/V 150  \nV2/V 150 \nRL/Ω 30  \nFig. 16 show an experimental comparison of CM \ncurrent with different inductance structures in time \ndomain. The CM current problem of traditional DAB \nis caused by the asymmetry of phase-shift inductor. As \nshown in Fig. 16, high-frequency spikes of CM current \ncan be effectively attenuated with all three \nsymmetrical inductors. Furthermore, the CM current in \nregion 1 were almost eliminated. \n \nFig. 16  Experimental comparison of CM current with \ndifferent inductance structures in time domain \nAll three symmetrical inductor structures can \neffectively suppress CM current spikes in the time \ndomain. However, the discrete inductor structure \nintroduces a large equivalent inductance \nLeq into the \nCM circuit, worsening the CM EMI at the resonance \nfrequency. Fig. 17 shows an experimental comparison \nof CM EMI between the asymmetric and discrete \nsymmetric inductors. Discrete inductors effectively \nattenuated low-frequency (9  kHz-1 MHz) EMI peaks. \nThere was a CM reduction effect of approximately 20 \ndB at low frequencies. Owing to the resonance \nproblem of the CM impedance, the CM current \nintroduced by the CM voltages of the bridges \nincreased instead; thus, the suppression effect was \npoor near 700 kHz. \n \nFig. 17  Experimental comparison of CM EMI between \nasymmetric inductor and discrete symmetric inductors \nTo solve this resonance problem, a CM filter using a \ncoupled symmetrical inductor is proposed. Fig. 18 \n Dong Jiang et al.: Common-mode El ectromagnetic Interference Mitigation for Solid-state Transformers \n \n29 \nshows an experimental comparison of the CM EMI \nbetween the asymmetric and coupled symmetric \ninductors. The equivalent impedance of the coupled \ninductor was much smaller than that of the discrete \ninductors. Moreover, the resonance frequency was \ngreater than 700 kHz; theref ore, the CM EMI spike at \n700 kHz was effectively improved. Furthermore, \ncompared with \nLc1, Lc2 had better high-frequency \ncharacteristics with a hi gher frequency of CM EMI \nspikes, owing to the smaller leakage inductance. \nHowever, in the high-frequency range (1-30 MHz), the \nCM current was primarily generated by the bridge CM \nvoltage excitation owing to the attenuation of the \nbridge DM voltages and low CM impedance of the \npropagation path; therefore, the mitigation effect of the \nCM filter by the coupled symmetrical inductor is \nlimited. \n \nFig. 18  Experimental comparison of CM EMI between \nasymmetric and coupled symmetric inductors \nIn general, the CM filter using the coupled inductor \ncan effectively reduce the CM EMI in the \nlow-frequency band and reduce the volume of the \nadditional EMI filter without affecting the power \ntransmission characteristics. \n4  Active CM EMI mitigation  \nUsing passive components can impede CM EMI \npropagation and introduce more weight. In addition to \npassive CM filter integration, another approach for \nCM EMI mitigation in the DAB is to actively shape \nthe CM EMI source. This approach includes a variable \nswitching frequency and active EMI filter.  \n4.1  Variable switching frequency  \nVariable switching frequency (VSF) modulation is a \ntypical type of spread-spectrum modulation. By \nchanging the degrees of freedom of the switching \nfrequency, VSF modulation disperses the energy of \nnarrow-band harmonics, originally concentrated in the \nswitching frequency and its multiples to a wider \nspectrum range, such that the harmonic spikes are \nattenuated and smoothed. The ability of the VSF \nmodulation to suppress EMI is related to the variation \ncharacteristics of the switching frequency. \nTheoretically, the more evenly the switching frequency \nis dispersed within the allowable range, the better is \nthe EMI suppression effect. The VSF modulation \nmethod with uniform distribution (UD) characteristics \nwas first applied to a three-phase inverter system\n [17]. \nIn this section, the UDVS F phase-shift modulation \napplied to the DAB is introduced. \nThe designed UDVSF modulation exhibits the \ncharacteristics of periodic variation; the variation \nperiod is assumed to be \nTm=1/fm. The switching \nfrequency fs is defined as a function of θ, where \nθ=2πfmt=ωmt. D[fs(θ)] is the distribution density \ncorresponding to the switching frequency function \nfs(θ). The larger the value of D[fs(θ)], the greater the \ndistribution of the corresponding switching frequency. \nAccording to the analysis of the UDPWM\n [17] , the \nswitching frequency fs(θ) and the rate of switching \nfrequency change | fs\n'(θ)| collectively affect the \ndistribution characteristics of the switching frequency.  \nWhen the switching frequen cy changes linearly, a \nhigher switching frequency results in more sampling \npoints and larger D[fs(θ)]. That is \n ( )( )ssDf f θ θ⎡⎤ ∝⎣⎦  (11) \nFor a specific switching frequency, the faster the \nswitching frequency changes, the smaller the number \nof samples and the smaller\n the D[fs(θ)].

Fig. 20 shows the statistical \ndistribution characteristics of the switching frequency; \nthe switching frequency range is equidistantly \ndistributed in ten intervals, and the sampling points of \neach interval are approximately 10%. The statistical \ndistribution characteristics shown in Fig. 20 prove that \nthe analytical function switching function in Eq. (17) \ncan satisfy the requirements of a UD. \n \nFig. 19  Switching frequency waveform of UD modulation \nBased on the above principle, the variation mode of \nthe switching frequency based on UD was designed. \nThe designed UD method can be directly applied in \npractice. However, in contrast to AC/DC or DC/AC \npower conversion, the switching frequency variation \nmay cause fluctuations in the power delivery of the \nDAB. For general DC/AC converters, the fundamental \nwave of low frequency (such as 50 Hz) undertakes the \nmain task of power transm ission. The high-frequency \ncomponents of the switching and multiple switching \nfrequencies are typically harmonics that need to be \nlimited. However, for the DAB converter, bidirectional \npower flow is realiz ed by high-frequency \nvoltage/current through a high-frequency isolation \ntransformer. Therefore, the switching frequency \nvariation may affect power transmission. \n \nFig. 20  Statistical distribu tion of switching frequency \nA DAB typically adopts phase-shift modulation \nmethods, such as SPS and ex tended-phase-shift (EPS), \nrather than PWM. Taking SPS modulation as an \nexample, the average transmission power of the DAB \nunder SPS modulation can be represented by Eq. (18), \nwhere V\n1 is the primary-side DC voltage, V2 is the \nsecondary-side DC voltage, n is the transformer ratio, \nand D is the phase-shift ratio.  \n ()\n12 12 s\nnV VP DDfL=−  (18) \nThe DAB power is inversely proportional to the \nswitching frequency fs, as shown in Eq. (18). Similarly, \nother phase-shifting modulation methods are directly \nrelated to the switching frequency.  \nTo solve the problem of power fluctuation, it is \nnecessary to control th e phase-shift angle (or D) while \nthe switching frequency changes to stabilize the power \ntransmission. A convenient method is to deduce D \nusing Eq. (18); D changes with the switching \nfrequency f\ns in each switching cycle.  \nTo validate the proposed UD phase-shift modulation \n Dong Jiang et al.: Common-mode El ectromagnetic Interference Mitigation for Solid-state Transformers \n \n31 \nmethods, experiments were performed with an \nexperimental platform. Tab. 4 lists the system \nparameters. The DAB operates at a constant switching \nfrequency (CSF) modulation with a nominal switching \nfrequency (f\nsN) used as a reference. \nTab. 4  Parameters of the DAB system with VSF \nParameter Value \nPrimary voltage V1/V 200 \nSecondary voltage V2/V 80 \nNominal switching frequency fsN/kHz 20 \nSwitching frequency flower-fupper/kHz 10-20 \nFig. 21 shows the experimental results for the \nprimary inductance voltage, primary inductance \ncurrent, and secondary voltage for the CSF and VSF \ncases. During the CSF modulation, in addition to the \nDC component, the secondary-side voltage also contains \nhigh-frequency components with a peak value of \napproximately 0.2 V; however, the content of these \nhigh-frequency components is minimal. Therefore, the \nsecondary voltage and power transmission are stable. In \nthe VSF modulation, there is a low-frequency component \nof 100 Hz with a peak value of approximately 0.3 V , \nintroduced by the periodic variation of the switching \nfrequency. However, after the phase-shift control of each \nswitching cycle, its content is also controlled within a very \nsmall range (4‰). \n \nFig. 21  Experimental results of primary inductance voltage vL, primary inductance current iL, and secondary voltage V2 \nFig. 22 shows a CM EMI comparison obtained using the \nEMI test receiver. The application of UD phase-shift \nmodulation in the DAB mitigates CM EMI by up to 10 dB \nin the frequency range of 150 kHz- 1 MHz, compared with \nthe CSF modulation. In the higher range of 1-30 MHz, the \nEMI characteristics are dominated by the transient state of \nthe switching action, rather than the PWM; therefore, the \nCM EMI of the two cases are similar. \nChinese Journal of Electrical Engineering, V ol.8, No.3, September 2022 \n \n32\n \nFig. 22  Experimental comparison of CM EMI \n4.2  Active EMI filter \nIn contrast to the VSF modulation, which shapes the \nEMI source by PWM, the AEF compensates for the \nEMI with extra active components. It is primarily \ncomposed of three parts: the sensing, amplifying, and \ncompensating sections. The sensing and compensating \nsignals are in the form of voltage or current. Based on \nthe signal types of the sensing and compensating \nsections, the AEF can be divided into four topologies. \nIn an SST hardware, substantial CM EMI is generated \nby the high-frequency switch ing of power electronics \nand numerous parasitic parameters. To reduce the \ninfluence of CM EMI on the power supply and other \nfront-side equipment, this study adopts a \ncurrent-sensing current-compensating (CSCC)-type of \nAEF. As discussed in Section 2, there are several ways \nfor CM current to circulate. The CSCC AEF can easily \ndetect the CM current on the DC bus, and the reverse \ncompensating current can be generated and injected \ninto the DC side to eliminate CM EMI directly. Fig. 23 \nshows a schematic of the feedforward CSCC AEF. \nV\nCM(s) represents the equivalent CM voltage. ZCM(s) \nrepresents the CM impedance of the testing equipment. \nZ\nLISNs(s) represents the impedance of the LISNs. \nIcancel(s) represents the compensating current generated \nby the AEF. A( s) represents the entire current \namplification of the AEF. \n \nFig. 23  Schematic diagram of the proposed AEF  \nWith the compensating current Icancel(s) injected, the \nCM noise current ICM(s) on the DC side is given by \n CM CMO\nCM LISNs\n1( )() ()1( ) / ( 1 ( ) / ( ) )\nAsI sI sAs Z s Z s\n−=⋅ −+  (19) \nIn Eq. (19), ICMO(s) represents the bare CM noise \ncurrent without the AEF. According to Eq. (19), to \nachieve a good CM EMI suppression effect, A(s) \nshould approach unity, and the amplitude of Z\nCM(s) \nshould be much larger than that of the ZLISNs(s). Fig. 24  \n \nFig. 24  Topology of the DAB with the proposed AEF \n Dong Jiang et al.: Common-mode El ectromagnetic Interference Mitigation for Solid-state Transformers \n \n33 \nshows the detailed topology of the DAB with the \nproposed AEF. To make the CM loop clearer, an extra \ndesigned C\nad and Rad are added, and the CM current \nflows through this circuit to the ground. In addition, \nthe CM impedance relationship of the proposed AEF is \nsatisfied. \nThe DC bus was used as the one-turn-winding \nprimary inductor L\n3 to detect the entire CM current \nflowing through the system. The secondary inductor L4 \nwas paralleled to resistor R 3 to generate a voltage drop \nfor the AEF input. Subsequently, the compensating \ncurrent I\ncancel was produced by the amplification circuit \nof the AEF and injected into the DC side. An extra \nclass AB push-pull amplification circuit was used to \nenhance the output ability to compensate for the \ncurrent. The EMI tester was placed on the DC bus to \nobtain the frequency spectrum of the CM current. To \nensure that A(s) is unity, the winding turns of the \nsecondary inductor were set to 10, and R\n3 was 10 \ntimes that of R4. AD826 was used as the op-amp, and \nFZT692B and FZT792A were used as complementary \ntransistors in the push-pull circuit. Tab. 5 lists the \ncomponent parameters.\n \nTab. 5  Detailed parameters of components \nComponents Value Components Value \nTurns of L3 1 C3/μF 2.2 \nTurns of L4 10 C4/μF 3.3 \nR3/Ω 30 Cad/μF 3.3 \nR4/Ω 3 Rad/Ω 150 \nFig. 25 shows the implementation of the AEF. An \ninductance coil with concentric windings was used as \nthe secondary side of the transformer. The proposed \nAEF senses the CM noise I\nbCM and generates an \ninverse compensating current Icancel to be injected \nforward into the DC bus. Fig. 26 was obtained when \nthe power supply was 200 V and the switching \nfrequency was 10 kHz. This shows a comparison \nbetween I\nbCM and Icancel. The main components of the \nCM current are the cardinal harmonics of switching \nfrequency. The compensating current I\ncancel counteracts \nthe sensed signal IbCM well in the low-frequency band. \nHowever, the compensation effect of the \nhigh-frequency burrs was limited. The CM EMI \ncurrent tester was placed on the DC bus before the \ninjection point. Fig. 27 shows the tested spectrum of \nthe CM noise. Compared with the bare CM noise \ncurrent, there was a CM reduction effect of \napproximately 25 dB of the CM noise with the AEF \nfor low-frequency switching  harmonics below several \nhundred kilohertz. The compensation effect for \nhigh-frequency noise weakened because of the \nparasitic parameters of the AEF and the limitation of \nthe op-amp capacity. \n \nFig. 25  The implementation board of AEF \n \nFig. 26  Comparison of IbCM and Icancel \nThe VSF modulation disperses the energy of the \nnarrow-band harmonic to a wider spectrum range, \nsuch that the harmonic spikes are attenuated and \nsmoothed. In contrast to the VSF modulation, the AEF \ninjects compensating signals to attenuate the sensed \nEMI. When both methods are adopted, they do not \nconflict in theory. An experiment using a combination \nof the VSF modulation and AEF was performed to test \nthe EMI reduction effect, as shown in Fig. 28. With the \ncombination of the proposed VSF modulation and AEF, \nthe compensation effect within several hundred \nkilohertz was enhanced to 30 dB, better than 10 dB \nwhen using the VSF modulation alone. Owing to the \nChinese Journal of Electrical Engineering, V ol.8, No.3, September 2022 \n \n34\ndisadvantage of the AEF, the suppression effect for \nhigh-frequency noise was weak. \n \nFig. 27  Tested CM EMI with and without the proposed AEF  \n \nFig. 28  Tested CM EMI reduction with VSF (UD-SPS) and \nthe proposed AEF \n5  Conclusions \nThis study discusses the problem of CM EMI in SSTs. \nOwing to the switching of primary and secondary \ntransformers in the DAB and the parasitic parameters \nin the CM loop, CM EMI propagates through the SST \nand ground and interferes with key components in the \nSST. The CM EMI conductive model of SSTs was \nanalyzed. Based on the concept of passive filtering and \nactive mitigation, a few methods were evaluated in \nthis study. \n(1) The CM filter using the coupled inductor can be \nintegrated with the phase-shift inductor of the DAB. \nTherefore, it can effectively suppress CM EMI without \naffecting the DAB power transmission. However, \ncompared with the proposed VSF modulation and AEF, \nthis method relies on SPS modulation. \n(2) Periodic variation in the switching frequency \ncan help reduce the CM EMI peak in the frequency \ndomain. UDPWM was developed and tested in the \nDAB. It achieved a reduction of approximately 10 dB \nin the region below 1 MHz. Furthermore, this method \ncan be extended to other modulation methods. \nCompared with passive filters and AEFs, there is no \nneed to consider the complex parasitic parameters of \nthe interference path. \n(3) The AEF can sample and compensate for the \nCM EMI in the DAB and mitigate the CM EMI \nprimarily below the MHz region. Compared with the \nother two methods, the AEF requires additional \ndevices. However, it is universal for a variety of power \nelectronic converters. Furthermore, the AEF can be \ncombined with the aforementioned methods to \nsuppress CM EMI. \nWith further studies, the comprehensive application \nof these methods can achieve better CM EMI \nmitigation results in SSTs. \nReferences \n [1] J E Huber, J W Kolar.
