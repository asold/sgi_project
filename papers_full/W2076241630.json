All rights reserved.\nDOI 10.1016/j.gde.2010.05.001\nIntroduction\nSexual development, one of the most important and\nwidespread developmental processes, essentially entails\none simple choice: becoming male or female. Although\nthis suggests a common underlying genetic mechanism,\nan astoundingly diverse array of pathways regulates sex\ndetermination. Sanchez [1\n/C15/C15] reviewed current knowl-\nedge of sex determining mechanisms with a focus on\nprimary signals. In ﬂies (Diptera) the genedoublesex (dsx)\nacts as a conserved major switch at the bottom of the sex-\ndetermining cascade [1\n/C15/C15,2,3]. The part of the sex-deter-\nmining cascade where the primary signal is transmitted to\ndsx has, until recently, received less attention. Data from\nHymenoptera enabled comparison of sex determination\nmechanisms at a wider level within the insect class. This\nhas directed focus towardstransformer (tra) as a central\nplayer in the evolution of sex determination in insects. In\nthis review, we describe how tra translates different\nprimary signals into one of two sex-speciﬁc pathways\nand consider how its function may serve as the key\nprocess around which insect sex determination mechan-\nisms have evolved.\nDrosophila sex determination: the reference\nInsect sex determination has been extensively examined\nin Drosophila melanogaster [4–6] and has served as a\nreference for all other insects [7–9]. In Drosophila, the\nupstream genomic region ofSexlethal (Sxl) contains two\npromoters: Pearly and Pmaintenance, which is the late pro-\nmoter. The primary signal is based on the concentration\nof X-linked signal elements (XSE) that activate the early\nSxl promoter in diploid XX individuals only [10\n/C15] (see\nFigure 1). Transcription from the early promoter ofSxl\nyields a transcript that is spliced to encode a functional\nearly SXL protein. This splice pattern depends on the use\nof the 5\n0 splice site from the early exon E1, whereas in\nlater stages the 50 splice site of late exon 2 is used [11]. It\nresults in the default exclusion of exon 3- that contains in-\nframe stop codons- in the early transcript. This early\nprotein enables the production of a functional late SXL\nprotein, which further maintains female-speciﬁcSxl spli-\ncing by auto regulation. SXL also directs cryptic splicing\nof tra by binding to a polypyrimidine tract in the ﬁrsttra\nintron and forces the general splicing factor U2AF to use\nthe female-speciﬁc 3\n0 splice site in exon 3 instead of the\nnonsex-speciﬁc 30 splice site in exon 2. Thistra transcript\nyields a functional TRA protein [12–14], which interacts\nwith the nonsex-speciﬁc transformer2 protein (TRA2) [15]\nand binds to thedsx transcript in the middle of exon 4,\ncalled thedsx repeat element (dsxRE). This dsxRE con-\ntains six copies of the 13 nucleotide sequence TC(T/A)\n(T/A)C(A/G)ATCAACA [16]. Located between repeat\nelement ﬁve and six of thedsxRE is a purine-rich enhancer\nelement (PRE) which is required for the speciﬁc binding of\nTRA2 to thedsxRE [17]. The binding of TRA/TRA2 to the\ndsxRE and PRE sites retains exon four in thedsx pre-\nmRNA resulting in female-speciﬁc splicing ofdsx at the\nbottom of the cascade [18–20], generating a female-speciﬁc\nDSX protein.\nIn XY males the level of XSEs is insufﬁcient for earlySxl\ntranscription and no early SXL protein is synthesized,\npreventing the auto regulatory loop from establishing. As\na result, Sxl pre-mRNA from the late promoter is male\nspeciﬁcally spliced by default, yielding a truncated non-\nfunctional SXL protein. The absence of SXL leads to the\n‘default’ splicing of thetra pre-mRNA and a nonfunc-\ntional TRA protein. Without TRA, dsx pre-mRNA is\nspliced by default generating a male-speciﬁc DSX\nprotein.\nCurrent Opinion in Genetics & Development2010, 20:376–383 www.sciencedirect.com\nThe TRA/TRA2 complex also regulates female-speciﬁc\nsplicing of fruitless ( fru), which yields a nonfunctional\nFRU protein [21], while absence of TRA leads to male-\nspeciﬁc fru splicing and a functional FRU protein.Fru is\nnot part of the (morphological) sex determination path-\nway but seems conserved in insects [22,23] and reviewed\nin [24]. It is conserved in both gene structure and its\nfunction as a determiner of male sexual behavior.\nConservation of sex-determining genes in\ninsects\nThere is a common pattern in insect sex-determining\ncascades: at the bottom isdsx, which has been identiﬁed\nfor all examined dipteran [25–32] and hymenopteran\ninsect species [ 33,34/C15]. DSX has two characteristic\ndomains: a DNA binding domain (DM or OD1) and an\noligomerization domain (dsx dimer or OD2). Oliveiraet al.\n[34\n/C15] showed for several insect species that amino acid\nalignment of these domains followed the established\nphylogeny, suggesting their importance in sexual differ-\nentiation. Conservation ofdsx is in agreement with Wilk-\nins’ theory [35] stating that regulatory elements are\nrecruited into sex-determining pathways, causing diver-\ngence towards the top, whiledsx remains conserved at the\nbottom. However, as more and more sex-determining\ncascades are elucidated, it appears that conservation is\nnot only at the level ofdsx, but also at the regulation of its\nsex-speciﬁc splicing.\nTransformer\nAfter the initial identiﬁcation inCeratitis capitata [36/C15/C15],\nalso in other insect species (Anastrepha sp., Bactrocera\noleae, Lucilia cuprina, Musca domestica, Apis mellifera and\nNasonia vitripennis), dsx splicing regulator genes have\nbeen identiﬁed that all appear to beD. melanogaster tra\northologs [37,38,39/C15,40,41/C15,42/C15/C15]. A tra ortholog has not\n(yet) been identiﬁed in Lepidoptera, perhaps because of\nthe strong sequence divergence that characterizes tra\nevolution. InBombyx morino tra ortholog has been found\nbased on the lack ofdsxRE or PRE binding sites onBmdsx\nand the presumed default mode of female-speciﬁc spli-\ncing [43,44]. However, dsxRE/PRE binding sites have\nonly been identiﬁed in dipterans based on homology to\nDrosophila and are probably so diverged that recognition\nof these sites in other orders is difﬁcult. Choet al.[ 33]\nreported the absence ofdsxRE/PRE binding sites in the\nhymenopteran A. mellifera and suggested that Amdsx\nfollows default female-speciﬁc splicing, similar toB. mori.\nInsect sex determinationVerhulst, van de Zande and Beukeboom 377\nFigure 1\nThe sex determination cascade in Drosophila melanogaster.

The gray bottom half of the sex-determining cascade shows the conserved part of the cascade.\nwww.sciencedirect.com Current Opinion in Genetics & Development2010, 20:376–383\nNevertheless, a functionaltra ortholog has recently been\nfound inA. mellifera, termedfeminizer, which is function-\nally and structurally similar totra [39/C15,45]. Interestingly, a\ncomparison between dsx of hymenopterans A. mellifera\nand N. vitripennis revealed putative dsxRE/PRE binding\nsites that indeed have severely diverged from those of\nDiptera [23]. SimilardsxRE/PRE binding sites have been\nidentiﬁed in theNasonia fruitless gene [23] and inNvtra\n[42\n/C15/C15]. Hence, the illustrious feminizing factor on the W\nchromosome inB. mori[46/C15/C15,47], may be an unconﬁrmed\northolog of tra that also functions as active feminizing\nfactor. In the mosquitoAnopheles gambiae and the phorid\nﬂy Megaselia scalaris, onlydsx has been found to date, but\ntra is surmised to be the regulating splice factor ofAgdsx\nand Msdsx since dsxRE/PRE binding sites have been\nidentiﬁed [31,27].\nThe functional importance of thesedsx splicing regulators\nin female development has been shown by RNA inter-\nference (RNAi) in early embryos, which resulted in male-\nspeciﬁc dsx splicing [36/C15/C15,37,38,45,40,41/C15,42/C15/C15]. The sub-\nsequent transformation of otherwise female offspring was\nnot always complete and resulted in intersexes with\nvarious stages of masculinization, while male develop-\nment remained unaffected. Although these tra genes\ndiffer largely in their nucleotide and amino acid compo-\nsition, their function as the sex-speciﬁc splicing regulator\nof dsx appears conserved [9]. Strikingly, a conserved\npattern of tra regulation in all insect species is the sex-\nspeciﬁc alternative splicing that produces transcripts in\nmales that contain early in-frame stop codons and yield\nno protein. Only the female-speciﬁc splicing of tra\npre-mRNA yields a full-length transcript and leads to\nTRA protein production. This active TRA protein directs\nfemale speciﬁc splicing of dsx, implying a functional\nconservation in insect sex determination.\nTra regulation of dsx apparently constitutes the axis of\ninsect sex determination. It likely acquired its function in\nthe early ancestors of the insects, as tra orthologs are\nfound throughout the insect class including Diptera,\nHymenoptera and Coleoptera (Figure 2), but apparently\nhas no sex determining function in the crustaceanDaph-\nnia [48]. The large sequence divergence indicates thattra\nconservation is predominantly at the functional and less at\nthe structural level. This becomes apparent when TRA\nprotein sequences are compared among species. Com-\nparison of the insect classiﬁcation to a phylogeny based on\nthe TRA protein sequence reveals that its evolution has\nfollowed species divergence conﬁrming that conservation\nlies in function rather than sequence (Figure 3). Strik-\ningly, alignment of TRA orthologs shows that only the\nproline and Arg/Ser rich regions are conserved throughout\nthe examined insect species, reﬂecting their function as\n378 Developmental mechanisms, patterning and evolution\nFigure 2\nClassification of insects and the conservation of dsx and tra.

One additional domain is conserved in\nHymenoptera only, a second domain is conserved in all\nspecies except Drosophila [48] and a third domain is\nconserved in all Diptera (Figure 3). The second domain\nmay function in tra auto regulation that is absent in\nD. melanogaster and replaced by Sxl. The other two\ndomains are apparently not involved intra splicing but\nmay have other unknown functions.\nDoublesex\nDsx belongs to a class of DM domain containing genes\nthat are conserved outside the insect class, and regulates\nsex determination in both vertebrates [43,49–53] and\ninvertebrates [54–56]. Tra, on the other hand, has been\nidentiﬁed as adsx splicing factor in insects only [48]. A\ncomparison of sex-determining cascades in different\ninsect groups reveals that diversity essentially starts at\nthe level of regulation oftra splicing and thattra acts as\nreceptor for various primary signals. These signals are\nvery diverse and include X-chromosome dose [10\n/C15], a\nmale determining factor on the Y chromosome and/or\nautosome [36/C15/C15,57], and a feminizing factor on the W\nchromosome [47] in diploids, as well as complementary\nsex determination and genomic imprinting sex determi-\nnation in haplodiploids [ 42/C15/C15,58,59/C15/C15]. Therefore, the\nconserved part of the insect sex-determining cascade\nmust be extended to includetra, and from an evolutionary\nperspective, tra appears to serve as the gene around which\nﬂexibility in sex determination is manifested.\nEvolution oftra regulation...\nIn alltra (or fem) containing insects exceptD. melanogaster,\nfemale speciﬁc splicing oftra involves an auto regulatory\nloop, in which the TRA protein is required for female\nInsect sex determinationVerhulst, van de Zande and Beukeboom 379\nFigure 3\nAmino acid alignment and protein sequence tree of tra/fem proteins identified in insect species from three different orders.

Maternal input oftra mRNA or protein into the\neggs has been demonstrated for all examined species\nexcept D. melanogaster and A. mellifera and has been\nsurmised to starttra auto regulation. In the haplodiploid\nN. vitripennis it has been shown for the ﬁrst time that\nsufﬁcient levels of maternally providedtra mRNA in eggs\nare required for female development. Knockdown oftra\nin mothers leads to a diminished amount of maternally\nprovided tra mRNA in eggs and results in diploid males\n[42\n/C15/C15]. InDrosophila, Sxl has been recruited upstream of\ntra and is female speciﬁcally regulated through its own\nauto regulatory loop. However, Siera and Cline [61/C15]\nshowed that tra auto regulation may also be ancestral\nin Drosophila since a positive feedback loop oftra still\noperates throughSxl, which in turn regulatestra splicing.\nTra regulation by X chromosome dose may occur outside\nthe Drosophilidae but most likely in the absence ofSxl.\nHow this is accomplished remains to be investigated. In\nA. melliferaa duplication offem has been recruited into the\nsex-determining cascade and initiates female-speciﬁc\nsplicing of fem transcripts [39\n/C15]. Overall, the maternal\nprovision of tra to eggs appears to be an ancestral regu-\nlatory mechanism, as all deviations from this system are of\nrecent origin.\nTwo intriguing questions are how variations intra regu-\nlation can account for the large variety in sex determining\nmechanisms in insects and how turnovers in signals and\ngenes controllingtra can occur during evolution. A com-\nparison between diploid and haplodiploid sex determi-\nnation is particularly illustrative as a ‘ﬂipover’ of tra\nregulation may lie at the basis of the difference between\nthese two modes of sex determination.\n... in diploid insects\nThe principle oftra regulation in diploid insects is that\nthe paternally inherited genome inhibits female splicing\nof tra in a variety of ways. A diverse array of primary\nsignals directly or indirectly regulates sex-speciﬁc splicing\nof tra. A common theme in a number of dipteran insects is\na masculizing (M) factor on the Y chromosome that is\ntransmitted through males only. M actively blocks the\ntranscription or translation of tra, preventing the auto-\nregulatory loop from establishing in ways that are not yet\nwell understood [36\n/C15/C15,40,41/C15]. Thus, the paternally inher-\nited M factor actively inhibits female development in XY\nindividuals. InDrosophila the presence of twice as much X\nsignal elements in XX animals directs female-speciﬁc\ntranscription of Sxl and starts the female-speciﬁc path\nof the sex-determining cascade [10\n/C15].\nA special case is Lepidoptera in which females are the\nheterogametic sex (ZW females, ZZ males) [46/C15/C15]. As only\nfemales contribute a W chromosome containing a fem-\ninizing factor, males passively promote male develop-\nment. In their theoretical treatise on the evolution of\nsex determination, Pomiankowskiet al.[ 62] inferred how,\nbased upon initial allelic variation fordsx (dsx\nM: masculiz-\ning factor anddsx+: feminizing factor) conversion totra\nregulation can evolve. Assuming that TRA splices only\ndsx+ into a female form but notdsxM, a mutation creating a\nstop codon in thetra exon 2 (traS) would be favourable for\ntraS/traS males, as no female DSX is produced. Simu-\nlations showed that this could eventually lead to elimin-\nation ofdsxM and to evolution of female heterogamy for\ntraS/tra+ [62].\nTwo general rules emerge from comparing the different\nprimary signals of diploid insects. First, a paternally\nderived genome is always necessary for male develop-\nment and second, actively or passively, it always prevents\nthe activation oftra (or Sxl).\n... in haplodiploid insects\nA number of insect groups, including thrips (Thysanop-\ntera), beetles (Coleoptera) and all Hymenoptera, have\nhaplodiploid sex determination: males are haploid,\ndevelop from unfertilized eggs and only inherit a\nmaternal genome, whereas females are diploid, develop\nfrom fertilized eggs and inherit a paternal and a maternal\ngenome. It is therefore impossible for the paternally\ninherited genome to have a masculinizing effect as in\ndiploids. Instead, the paternal genome must have\nacquired a complete reversal in sex determining function,\nthat is by feminizing rather than masculinizing.\nUntil recently, knowledge about primary signals in hap-\nlodiploid species was limited to complementary sex\ndetermination (csd) in which gender is determined by\nthe allelic state of thecomplementary sex determiner (csd)\ngene. Although csd has been inferred for more than 60\nhymenopterans [63], thecsd gene has been characterized\nin the honey bee only [58]. Females are heterozygous and\nmales hemizygous at this locus, but the biochemical\ndetails of CSD function are not yet completely known\n[39\n/C15,45]. Interestingly, the csd primary signal can also be\nbased on multiple loci (ml-csd) [64]. However, in all csd\ncases the paternally contributed genome provides the\nsecond csd allele that is required for female development.\nIn another hymenopteran,Nasonia, csd has been ruled out\nas the primary signal [65]. InNasonia female-speciﬁc tra is\nmaternally provided to eggs. In embryos from fertilized\neggs early zygotic expression of tra is higher than in\nembryos from unfertilized eggs, which initiates an auto\nregulatory loop oftra and results in femaledsx splicing\n[42\n/C15/C15]. In embryos from unfertilized eggs no early zygotic\nexpression oftra occurs and the auto regulatory loop does\nnot establish, leading to male-speciﬁctra and dsx splicing.\nThe difference in zygotic tra expression cannot be\nexplained by masculinizing factors. Instead, thetra gene,\nor a trans acting factor that inﬂuencestra expression, on\nthe maternal genome is rendered inactive by maternal\n380 Developmental mechanisms, patterning and evolution\nCurrent Opinion in Genetics & Development2010, 20:376–383 www.sciencedirect.com\nimprinting. In an unfertilized egg, only this maternally\nimprinted gene is present that preventstra transcription\nand precludes the auto regulatory loop. In a fertilized egg,\nboth a maternal and a paternal genome are present. The\npaternal set has an active, nonsilenced gene so thattra\nwill be transcribed enabling the maternally providedtra\nmRNA to start auto regulation oftra, eventually leading\nto female development [ 42\n/C15/C15]. A mutant stain of N.\nvitripennis that produces gynandromorphs and females\nfrom haploid unfertilized eggs [66,67] may be explained\nby incomplete imprinting in the maternal germ line.\nThe honeybee andNasonia results indicate that, in con-\ntrast to diploids, the paternally inherited genome is\nalways necessary for female development in haplodi-\nploids and, actively or passively, promotes the activation\nof tra.\nConclusions and outlook\nMuch has been learned about sex determination in\nmammals [68] and plants [69–71], but comparative work\non a variety of insect species has been particularly fruitful\nfor understanding how sex determination regulation\nevolves. Twenty-ﬁve years ago No¨ thiger and Stein-\nmann-Zwicky [5] proposed that sex determination in\nall insects is based on a single principle. We can conclude\nthat these authors were partly correct. The sex-speciﬁc\nregulation of dsx splicing by tra appears to constitute a\nconserved gene axis in all insects. Clearly, the central\ngene around which diversity evolves is notSxl, as was\nsuggested from studies inDrosophila, but tra. A striking\nexample of the central role oftra in the evolution of insect\nsex determination is the complete reversal in the paternal\nregulation oftra upon the separation of Hymenoptera and\nDiptera.\nAlthough Drosophila has XX –XY sex determination,\nits processing of the primary signal and regulation of\ntra is different from all other ﬂies with this mode of\nsex determination. A number of other insect groups\nlikely rely on sex chromosome dose as primary signal,\nsuch as species with XX–XO sex determination (e.g.\ngrasshoppers (Orthoptera)), ZO–ZZ sex determination\n(e.g. some Lepidoptera [46\n/C15/C15]) and paternal X chromo-\nsome inactivation (e.g. coccids (Homoptera) and Sciarid\nﬂies [1\n/C15/C15]). Whether and how tra regulation occurs in\nthese groups remains an interesting unanswered ques-\ntion. In general, a broader taxonomic screen of how\nprimary signals are processed by tra would be worth-\nwhile as our current knowledge is virtually restricted to\nDiptera and Hymenoptera. Exploiting next generation\nsequencing technology will greatly expedite such an\nendeavor.\nAcknowledgement\nWe thank Albert Kamping and Daniel Bopp for fruitful discussions on\ninsect sex determination.\nReferences and recommended reading\nPapers of particular interest, published within the period of review,\nhave been highlighted as:\n/C15 of special interest\n/C15/C15of outstanding interest\n1.\n/C15/C15\nSanchez L: Sex-determining mechanisms in insects.
