  "abstract": "Domain squatting is a technique used by attackers to create domain names for\\nphishing sites. In recent phishing attempts, we have observed many domain names\\nthat use multiple techniques to evade existing methods for domain squatting.\\nThese domain names, which we call generated squatting domains (GSDs), are quite\\ndifferent in appearance from legitimate domain names and do not contain brand\\nnames, making them difficult to associate with phishing. In this paper, we\\npropose a system called PhishReplicant that detects GSDs by focusing on the\\nlinguistic similarity of domain names. We analyzed newly registered and\\nobserved domain names extracted from certificate transparency logs, passive\\nDNS, and DNS zone files. We detected 3,498 domain names acquired by attackers\\nin a four-week experiment, of which 2,821 were used for phishing sites within a\\nmonth of detection. We also confirmed that our proposed system outperformed\\nexisting systems in both detection accuracy and number of domain names\\ndetected. As an in-depth analysis, we examined 205k GSDs collected over 150\\ndays and found that phishing using GSDs was distributed globally. However,\\nattackers intensively targeted brands in specific regions and industries. By\\nanalyzing GSDs in real time, we can block phishing sites before or immediately\\nafter they appear.\\n",
