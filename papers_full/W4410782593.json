    "abstract": "Synthetic medical text generation has emerged as a solution to data scarcity and privacy constraints in clinical NLP. This review systematically evaluates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured medical text generation, examining techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structured fine-tuning, and domain-specific adaptation. Four search queries were applied following the PRISMA methodology to identify and extract data from 153 studies. Key benchmarking metrics, such as performance measures, and qualitative insights, including methodological trends and challenges, were documented. The results show that while LLM-generated text improves fluency, hallucinations and factual inconsistencies persist. Structured consultation models, such as SOAP and Calgary–Cambridge, enhance coherence but do not fully prevent errors. Hybrid techniques that combine retrieval-based grounding with domain-specific fine-tuning improve factual accuracy and task performance. Conventional evaluation metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU) are insufficient for medical validation, highlighting the need for domain-specific benchmarks. Privacy-preserving strategies, including differential privacy and PHI de-identification, support regulatory compliance but may reduce linguistic quality. These findings are relevant for clinical NLP applications, such as AI-powered scribe systems, where structured synthetic datasets can improve transcription accuracy and documentation reliability. The conclusions highlight the need for balanced approaches that integrate medical structure, factual control, and privacy to enhance the usability of synthetic medical text.",
