  "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;The dawn of the 21st century has witnessed groundbreaking advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), revolutionizing multiple domains from healthcare to finance, and reshaping the socio-economic landscape. A significant contributor to this paradigm shift is the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have emerged as powerful tools in understanding and generating human-like text. As with any technological disruption, LLMs prompt a pertinent question: As these models continue to permeate various industries, what implications do they hold for the global workforce? Will they serve as a catalyst for mass job displacement, or could they unlock unprecedented avenues of job creation? This article delves into this crucial debate, dissecting the dual-edged impact of LLMs on the world of employment [1,2].&lt;/p&gt;",
