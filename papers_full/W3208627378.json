Introduction\nHuman action recognition has been studied during the\npast decades and achieves promising progress in many\napplications ranging from human-computer interaction to\nvideo retrieval [4, 12, 28, 29]. Recently, skeleton-based\nrepresentation has received increasing attention due to\nits compactness of depicting dynamic changes in human\nbody movements [14]. Advanced pose estimation algo-\nrithms [2] and advances in the somatosensory cameras such\nInter-Part\nIntra-Part\nPart division \nFigure 1. Illustration of our main idea. The body joints are divided\ninto 5 parts. The Inter-Part branch is used to explore relationships\nbetween parts and the Intra-Part branch aims to capture dependen-\ncies between joints in the same part.\nas Kinect [38] and RealSense [15] make it possible to obtain\nbody keypoints accurately and quickly at a low cost. In ad-\ndition, skeleton-based representation is more robust to vari-\nations of illumination and background noises in contrast to\nRGB representation. These merits attract researchers to de-\nvelop various methods to exploit skeleton for action recog-\nnition.\nPrevious skeleton-based action recognition methods uti-\nlize graph topologies or manually designed rules to trans-\nform the raw skeleton sequence into a grid-shape structure\nsuch as pseudo-image [10, 17, 20] or graph, and then feed it\ninto RNNs, CNNs, or GCNs [36] to extract features. How-\never, there is no guarantee that the hand-crafted structure is\nthe best choice of capturing joints relationships, which lim-\nits the generalizability and performance of previous works.\nRecently, Transformer-based methods [22, 27] have been\nproposed, relying on the multi-head self-attention mecha-\nnism which adaptively explores the potential dependencies\nbetween skeleton joints. Speciﬁcally, Shi et al. [27] treat\neach individual joint as a token while the calculation of self-\nattention grows quadratically to the number of tokens, thus\nintroduces a huge amount of calculations. This work also\n1\narXiv:2110.13385v1  [cs.CV]  26 Oct 2021\nsuffers from the noisy skeleton joints collected by sensors\nor inaccurate estimations.\nTo solve these problems, we introduce the concept of\nbody parts into transformer network. Most of actions such\nas standing up or dancing are performed by co-movement\nof body parts. Actually, body parts can be considered as\nthe minimum units of action execution, which means these\nactions can be identiﬁed only by the movement of body\nparts. Different from other complex partition strategies, we\nsimply aggregate body joints into several parts according\nto human body topologies and encourage the model to ex-\nploit the complicated interactions. Speciﬁcally, we divide v\nbody joints into pparts and encode each part into a token,\nwhich reduces the spatial self-attention computation cost by\nv2/p2 times. Another advantage of our proposed partition\nencoding is that it enables the model to take sparser frames\nas temporal inputs, which brings in additional computation\nreduction. To encourage the model to reason globally in-\nstead of relying on a particular part, we propose a new data\naugmentation method named Part-Mask which masks out a\npart randomly during training. This new strategy makes the\nmodel more robust across challenging cases.\nSince the body joints are divided into parts, the joint-\nlevel information may be lost. For some ﬁne-grained ac-\ntions, e.g. clapping or writing, it is necessary to capture\nthe interactions between body joints additionally. We pro-\npose the novel Intra-Inter-Part Transformer network (IIP-\nTransformer) to tackle this issue and make three main\nimprovements comparing with standard Transformer net-\nworks. First, Intra-Inter-Part self-attention mechanism is\nproposed to simultaneously capture intra-part features and\ninter-part features without increasing much computational\ncomplexity, as depicted in Figure 1. Second, inspired by\nBERT [9], we introduce a learnable class-token instead of\npooling all features extracted by backbone. Last, instead\nof using two individual transformers to model spatial and\ntemporal dependencies, we propose a new spatial-temporal\ntransformer that reduces model size while increases the\ngeneralization of the model. The code and models will\nbe made publicly available at https://github.com/\nqtwang0035/IIP-Transformer.\nOverall, our contributions can be summarized as follows:\n• We introduce the concept of body parts into\ntransformer-based skeleton action recogni-\ntion. Our proposed partition encoding sig-\nniﬁcantly reduces self-attention computa-\ntional complexity and is relatively insensi-\ntive to joint noise.\n• We propose IIP-Transformer, a novel\nspatial-temporal transformer network that\ncaptures intra-part and inter-part relations\nsimultaneously.\n• Extensive experiments on two large-scale\nskeleton action datasets, e.g. NTU RGB+D\n60 & 120, show that our proposed IIP-\nTransformer achieves state-of-the-art per-\nformance with 2 ∼36×less computational\ncost.\n2. Related Work\nTransformer. In recent years, with the development of\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, the Transformer\nstructure [34] has been proposed to replace the traditional\nNLP network structures, e.g., RNNs. Different with RNN\narchitectures, the encoder and decoder of transformers com-\npletely rely on the self-attention mechanism, which can\neffectively solve the problems of long-sequence modeling\nand parallel processing. Because of these characteristics\nof the self-attention mechanism, the Transformer networks\nhave been also applied in various computer vision tasks\n[1, 3, 11, 22] and achieve superior results comparing with\nthe CNN models.\nSkeleton-based Action Recognition. Skeleton-based ac-\ntion recognition has received increasing attentions due to\nits compactness comparing with the RGB-based representa-\ntions. Previous data-driven methods rely on manual designs\nof traversal rules to transform the raw skeleton data into\na meaningful form such as a point-sequence or a pseudo-\nimage, so that they can be fed into the deep networks such\nas RNNs or CNNs for feature extraction [8, 16, 17, 35]. In-\nspired by the booming graph-based methods, Yanet al. [36]\nintroduce GCN into the skeleton-based action recognition\ntask, and propose the ST-GCN to model the spatial conﬁgu-\nrations and temporal dynamics of skeletons simultaneously.\nThe GCN-based methods [7, 26] use the topological struc-\nture of the human skeleton to aggregate features of related\nskeleton nodes and time series. Therefore, the GCN-based\nmethods show better performance than previous methods.\nInstead of formulating the skeleton data into the images or\ngraphs, Transformer-based methods directly model the de-\npendencies of joints with pure attention blocks. Plizzari et\nal. [22] propose a method that introduces Transformer in\nskeleton activity recognition and combine it with GCN. Shi\net al. [27] employ a solely transformer network to exploit\nrelations between joints. Our proposed method utilizes part-\nlevel input, thus could efﬁciently capture both joint-level\nand part-level relations.\nPart-based Methods. Part-based methods are designed\nto extract features of body parts individually since human\nbody is a natural topology with ﬁve major parts. Thakkar\net al. [33] divide graph into several sub-graphs with shared\nnodes. They employ GCN operation within sub-graphs of\nbody parts and then propagate information between sub-\ngraphs via the shared nodes.

[31] propose part-attention mechanism to dis-\ncover the most informative parts. All these part-based meth-\nods employ complex strategies to propagate information in-\ndividually or fuse information from all parts, while our work\nfocuses on simultaneously capturing discriminative features\nfrom intra and inter parts with less computational cost.\n3. Methods\n3.1. Overall Architecture\nFigure 2 shows the overall architecture of our pipeline,\nwhich mainly contains two sections, the partition encoding\nand the IIP-Transformer network. For an input skeleton se-\nquence with V joints, F frames and C channels, we ﬁrst\ndivide V joints into P parts, and then a patch embedding\nlayer is used to project these part data into N tokens with\ndimension Cp, where N = P ×F. Before being fed into\nIIP-Transformer, a class-token will be concatenated with to-\nkens above, resulting in N + 1tokens. There are Llayers\nstacked in IIP-Transformer in total and each layer is com-\nposed of a spatial IIPA module (S-IIPA) that models the\nspatial relations between parts in the same frame, a tem-\nporal IIPA module (T-IIPA) that captures the temporal re-\nlations of parts among different frames and a feed-forward\nnetwork. Each layer of IIP-Transformer maintains the same\nnumber of tokens, and thus we get N + 1tokens as ﬁnal\noutput features. We feed the feature corresponding to the\nclass-token into a fully-connected layer to obtain the clas-\nsiﬁcation scores. The implementation details will be intro-\nduced in the following sections.\n3.2. Partition Encoding\nIn order to reduce the computation complexity of self-\nattention in spatial dimension, we propose a strategy to en-\ncode the joints intoP parts (5 parts in our case speciﬁcally).\nThe partition encoding procedure is illustrated in Figure 3.\nFirst, the raw skeleton sequence X ∈RC×F×V is fed into\nfeature extraction layers fJ(·) to obtain a deeper feature\n𝑁×𝐶!\n𝑿\nReshape\nPatch  Embedding\n𝐶\"×F×𝑀×𝑃\n𝐶×𝐹×𝑉\n𝑁×𝐶#\n𝑿𝒑\nFeature Extraction\nPart Division 𝐶\"×𝐹×𝑉\nFigure 3. Illustration of the Partition Encoding Procedure.\nXJ ∈ RCo×F×V , where Co denotes the channel of fea-\ntures after feature extraction and fJ(·) is implemented by\ntwo convolution layers with BatchNorm and ReLU func-\ntion. Then P individual body parts are obtained by selecting\ncorresponding joints:\nXJ →[x1,x2,··· ,xP ],xi ∈RCo×F×M (1)\nwhere M denotes the max number of joints in each part.\nThe parts with less than M joints will be padded with zero.\nSubsequently, we concatenate P parts and permute the di-\nmensions:\n˜XJ = Concat(xi|i= 1,2,··· ,P) (2)\n˜XJ ∈RCo×F×M×P →RN×Cm (3)\nwhere N = P ×F and Cm = Co ×M. Finally, ˜XJ is fed\ninto patch embedding layer fP (·) to aggregate information\nof the internal skeleton joints of a part and we get the ﬁnal\n3\npartition encoding XP ∈RN×CP , where CP is the chan-\nnels of the partition encoding and fP (·) is implemented by\nlinear layers with ReLU function.\nBy aggregating the information of the internal skeleton\njoints of the parts, an informative encoding is extracted. It\ndrives the model to concentrate on body parts instead of\njoints, and thus reduce the inﬂuence of individual noisy\njoints. Besides, experiments show that the partition encod-\ning enables model to take sparser temporal inputs.\n3.3. Intra-Inter-Part Transformer\nThe backbone of IIP-Transformer is constructed by\nstacking L layers of Spatial-Temporal Transformer Layer\nwhich is composed of S-IIPA, T-IIPA and feed-forward net-\nwork. The core of S-IIPA and T-IIPA is Intra-Inter-Part\nSelf-Attention mechanism. In this section, the IIPA mech-\nanism and Spatial-Temporal Transformer will be brieﬂy in-\ntroduced.\nmulti-head self- attention\n𝒇𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒂(·)\n𝑿𝒐𝒖𝒕\nV\nK\nQ\n𝑿𝒊𝒏\nFigure 4. Illustration of the IIPA mechanism. The original multi-\nhead self attention is used to explore relations between tokens\nwhile the function fintra is used to capture internal relations of\na token.\nIntra-Inter-Part Self-Attention. Basic transformer uti-\nlizes self-attention mechanism to model the relationships\nbetween input tokens. But in part-level cases, each token\nrepresents a collection of joints in the same part. Therefore,\nthe relationships of joints in the same part have not been\nfully exploited and can not be propagated effectively. We\npresent a new self-attention mechanism named Intra-Inter-\nPart self-attention (IIPA) to simultaneously capture relation-\nships inside and between tokens. As shown in Figure 4,\nour proposed IIPA mainly consists of a standard multi-head\nself-attention and an intra-part branch.\nGiven the input feature Xin, we ﬁrst compute the query\nQ, key K and value V using three linear projection layers.\nThe information ﬂow across tokens is achieved by the stan-\ndard multi-head self-attention:\nXinter = MHSA (Q,K,V ) (4)\nThe intra-part branch fintra(·) is implemented by linear\nlayers. It takes value V as input and extracts features in-\nside tokens, termed joint-level feature.\nXintra = fintra (V) (5)\nFinally, we fuse the multi-head self-attention output Xinter\nwith the intra-part branch output Xintra, so that features\nextracted by IIPA carry both joint-level and part-level infor-\nmation.\nXout = Xinter + Xintra (6)\nComparing with standard self-attention mechanism, our\nproposed IIPA introduces no more than 1/4 calculations, but\nachieves obvious improvement in ﬁne-grained actions, as\nshown in ablation study.\n(A)\nSelf-AttentionAdd&NormFFNAdd&NormT-IIPAAdd&NormFFNAdd&Norm\nS-IIPAAdd&Norm\n(𝑷𝑭+𝟏)×𝑪 (𝑷𝑭+𝟏)×𝑪\n(𝑷𝑭+𝟏)×𝑪\n(B)\nFigure 5. Two Transformer structures. (A) Flatten the spatial-\ntemporal data into a single sequence and use an standard trans-\nformer. (B) Explore spatial and temporal relations with S-IIPA\nand T-IIPA respectively and fuse them by a feed-forward layer.\nSpatial-Temporal Transformer Layer. In previous\nskeleton-based action recognition transformers [22, 25], all\nfeatures extracted by backbone is average-pooled to obtain\nthe ﬁnal feature for classiﬁcation. Inspired by BERT [9],\nclass-token is introduced into our model. In BERT, the in-\nput X1d ∈R(N+1)×C is a single dimension sequence with\nN tokens and a class-token. The single dimension struc-\nture naturally ﬁts the self-attention mechanism. But for the\nskeleton sequence which has two dimensions, there are two\nproblems to solve: one is how to exploit spatial and tem-\nporal dimension with self-attention mechanism, another is\nhow to deal with class-token. The ﬁrst method is ﬂattening\nthe raw skeleton sequenceX2d ∈RP×F×C into a single di-\nmension sequence Xflatten ∈RPF ×C and concatenating it\nwith a class-token to obtain Xin ∈R(PF +1)×C, where P\ndenotes the number of parts and F denotes the number of\nframes. The output Xout ∈R(PF +1)×C is calculated by\na standard transformer and the corresponding structure is\nshown in Figure 5-(A):\nXout = softmax\n(QKT\n√\nC\n)\nV (7)\n4\nSelf-Attention𝑰𝑰𝑷𝑨\nC\nx𝒄𝒍𝒔𝒒 K V\n𝑿𝒇𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒍_𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒔\n𝑿𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒔x𝒄𝒍𝒔𝒐 reshape\nQ\n𝑽𝒔𝑸𝒔\nreshape\n𝑲𝒔\n𝑿𝒊𝒏\nx𝒄𝒍𝒔𝒌 x𝒄𝒍𝒔𝒗\nx𝒄𝒍𝒔\nFigure 6. Illustration of S-IIPA. The symbol C stands for concate-\nnate operation. T-IIPA has the same structure as S-IIPA except for\nreshape size of K, Q, V.\nHowever, it is unreasonable to treat spatial and temporal\nfeatures equivalently since the semantic information they\ncontain are totally different. Besides, the computational\ncomplexity of calculating the attention map is quadratic to\nsequence length, therefore ﬂattening the skeleton sequence\ninto a long single dimension sequence will introduce a large\namount of calculations.\nInstead, the spatial and temporal dimension are treated as\ntwo different dimensions in Spatial-Temporal Transformer\nlayer and processed by S-IIPA and T-IIPA respectively, as\nshown in Figure 5-(B). The input of S-IIPA and T-IIPA is\nthe same as above, a ﬂattened sequence with a class-token.\nS-IIPA is adopted to explore the dependencies of parts in\na single frame while T-IIPA is employed to propagate in-\nformation for each part across different frames. Let’s take\nS-IIPA for an example, we ﬁrst project the part-level se-\nquence Xin ∈ R(PF +1)×C with three linear projections\nlayers fq(·),fk(·) and fv(·):\nQcls,Q = fq (Xin) (8)\nKcls,K = fk (Xin) (9)\nVcls,V = fv (Xin) (10)\nwhere Qcls,Kcls,Vcls ∈R1×C and Q,K,V ∈RPF ×C.\nDue to the existence of class-token, we employ two\nbranches, the self-attention branch and IIPA branch, to\nmodel class-token and other tokens separately, as shown in\nFigure 6. The self-attention branch is similar to the above\nmethod, and thus the output Xo\ncls ∈R1×C could obtain in-\nformation from all parts at all frames.\nKc = Concat(Kcls,K) (11)\nVc = Concat(Vcls,V ) (12)\nXo\ncls = softmax\n(\nQcls (Kc)T\n√\nC\n)\nVc (13)\nIn the IIPA branch, we reshape K,Q,V from single\ndimension into temporal ×spatial dimension and repeat\nKcls,Qcls,Vcls in the temporal dimension, then concate-\nnate them in the spatial dimension.\nQ,K,V ∈RPF ×C →Qs,Ks,V s ∈RF×P×C (14)\nKcls,Vcls ∈R1×C →RF×1×C (15)\nKs = Concat(Kcls, Ks) (16)\nVs = Concat(Vcls, Vs) (17)\nBy following the preceding steps, we get Ks,V s ∈\nRF×(P+1)×C , (P + 1)means appending a class-token in\nevery frame. Then Qs,Ks,V s are fed into IIPA to calculate\nthe output frame by frame, and each frame uses a unique at-\ntention map:\nXf = softmax\n\n\nQs\nf\n(\nKs\nf\n)T\n√\nC\n\nVs\nf , f= 1,2 ··· ,F\n(18)\nwhere Xf ∈ RP×C is the output for frame f, Qs\nf ∈\nRP×C; Ks\nf , Vs\nf ∈ R(P+1)×C. Finally, we concatenate\nthe outputs of all frames and reshape it back to single di-\nmension:\nXs\nout = Concat({Xf |f = 1,2,··· ,F}) (19)\nXs\nout ∈RF×P×C →RFP ×C (20)\nXs\nfinal out = Concat(Xo\ncls,Xs\nout) (21)\nwhere Xs\nfinal out ∈ R(FP +1)×C is the ﬁnal output of\nS-IIPA with the same dimension size as the input se-\nquence. The only difference in T-IIPA is that Qt ∈\nRP×F×C; Kt,V t ∈ RP×(F+1)×C, corresponding to\nQs,Ks,V s, thus the output is calculated part by part.\nComparing with other spatial-temporal transformer\nmethods, e.g. DSTA [27], which uses two complete trans-\nformers to model space and time, we remove the feed-\nforward layer in the spatial transformer structure and com-\nbine S-IIPA, T-IIPA and feed-forward layer as a new spatial-\ntemporal transformer structure. This structure performs\nspatial and temporal feature extraction in one stage so that\nthe same-order features can be fully exploited. Meanwhile,\nit also reduces a large amount of parameters in feed-forward\nlayer and improves the generalizability of the model.\n5\n3.4. Data Augmentation\nRao et al. [23] propose several joint-level skeleton data\naugmentation methods, such as Rotation, GaussianNoise,\nGaussianBlur, JointMask, to improve the generalizability\nof models. However, since the part-level encoding is more\nrobust to joint noises, these methods do not work well on\npart-level skeleton data, except for Rotation. Therefore we\npropose a new data augmentation method called PartMask,\nto encourage the model to reason globally instead of relying\non a particular part. The Rotation and PartMask methods\nare deﬁned as follows.\nRotation. Most public skeleton-based datasets are captured\nin speciﬁc view points. We obtain plentiful data through\nRotation transformation which simulates viewpoint change\nof the camera.\nBased on Euler’s rotation theorem, any 3D rotation can\nbe disassembled into a composition of rotations about three\naxes [35]. The basic rotation matrices are represented as\nbelow:\nRx(α) =\n\n\n1 0 0\n0 cos α −sin α\n0 sin α cos α\n\n (22)\nRy(β) =\n\n\ncos β 0 sin β\n0 1 0\n−sin β 0 cos β\n\n (23)\nRz(γ) =\n\n\ncos γ −sin γ 0\nsin γ cos γ 0\n0 0 1\n\n (24)\nR= Rz(γ)Ry(β)Rx(α) (25)\nwhere Rx(α),Ry(β),RZ(γ) denote the rotation matrices\nof x,y,z axis with angle α,β,γ respectively, and Ris the\ngeneral rotation matrix that will be applied to original coor-\ndinates of the skeleton sequence. In this work, the rotation\nangles are randomly sampled from [−π/10,π/10].\nPartMask. As an effective augmentation strategy to reduce\nreliance on speciﬁc regions, the mask strategy has been\nwidely used in data augmentation. But simply employing\na random zero-mask to a number of body joints in skele-\nton frames before partition encoding, which is similar to\njoint-level noises, does not work well due to the anti-noise\nability of partition encoding. On the other hand, capturing\nthe global information instead of focusing on a particular\npart will beneﬁt the action classiﬁcation tasks. Therefore we\nemploy a part-level mask to encourage the model to reason\nglobally. Speciﬁcally, we randomly select a certain body\npart p from [1,2,··· ,P], and apply zero-mask to it in all\nframes:\nXJ = XJ ⊙mask\n= [x1,x2,··· ,xP ] ⊙[1,1,··· ,0\np\n,··· ,1] (26)\nwhere XJ denotes the intermediate result of partitioning,\nas discussed in Section 3.2, and mask is an all-ones vector\nexcept for the position of the selected part p.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. DataSets\nNTU RGB+D.NTU RGB+D [24] is a widely used large-\nscale human skeleton-based action recognition dataset,\nwhich contains 56,880 skeletal action sequences. These\naction sequences were performed by 40 volunteers and di-\nvided into 60 categories. Each action sequence is completed\nby one or two subjects and is captured by three Microsoft\nKinect-V2 cameras from different views simultaneously.\nThe benchmark evaluations include Cross-Subject (X-Sub)\nand Cross-View (X-View). In the Cross-Subject, training\ndata comes from 20 subjects, and testing data comes from\nthe other 20 subjects. In the Cross-View, training data\ncomes from camera views 2 and 3, and testing data comes\nfrom camera view 1. Note that there are 302 wrong samples\nthat need to be ignored.\nNTU RGB+D 120.NTU RGB+D 120 [18] is currently the\nlargest human skeleton-based action recognition dataset. It\nis an extension of the NTU RGB+D dataset, with 113,945\naction sequences and 120 action classes in total. These ac-\ntion sequences were performed by 106 volunteers, captured\nwith three cameras views, and contains 32 setups, each of\nwhich represents a different location and background. The\nbenchmark evaluations include Cross-Subject (X-Sub) and\nCross-Setup (X-Setup). In the Cross-Subject, training data\ncomes from 53 subjects, and testing data comes from the\nother 53 subjects. In the Cross-Setup, training data comes\nfrom samples with even setup IDs, and testing data comes\nfrom samples with odd setup IDs. In this dataset, 532 bad\nsamples should be ignored.\n4.2. Implementation Details\nAll experiments are conducted on 8 GTX 1080Ti GPUs.\nOur model is trained using SGD optimizer with momentum\n0.9 and weight decay 0.0002. The training epoch is set to\n300. Learning rate is set to 0.1 and decays with a cosine\nscheduler. The batch size is 64 and each sample contains 32\nframes. The number of Spatial-Temporal Transformer layer\nis set to 4.\n4.3. Ablation Study\nIn this section, we investigate the effectiveness of the\nproposed components of the IIP-Transformer. All experi-\nments are conducted on NTU RGB+D 60 with joint stream\nif no special instruction.\nEffect of IIPA.The comparison between IIPA and stan-\ndard Self-Attention in Table 1 shows that there are 1.8%\n6\nMethods X-Sub X-View\nStandard Self-Attention 85.3 91.2\nIIPA (ours) 87.1 93.2\nTable 1. Comparison between IIPA and standard Self-Attention.\nFigure 7. The accuracy comparison on actions with different mo-\ntion intensity. The categories above the red horizontal line are\nﬁne-grained action categories.\nand 2% improvements in X-Sub and X-View respectively.\nWe pick out some actions and visualize the changes of ac-\ncuracy between IIPA and standard Self-Attention in Figure\nFigure 7. It demonstrates that the IIPA achieves remarkable\nimprovements on ﬁne-grained actions (e.g., type on a key-\nboard, clapping, reading etc.), while the accuracy of drastic\nactions (e.g., throw, pushing, pickup etc.) is about the same,\nwhich indicates that our proposed IIPA can exploit the joint-\nlevel information of body parts more effectively.\nEffect of Class-Token.To explore the effect of class-token,\nwe replace it by simply performing global average pooling\nto the output features from last layer [22, 27]. As shown in\nTable 2, by introducing the class-token, the performance of\nX-Sub and X-View improve by 1.3% and 1.7% respectively.\nMethods X-Sub X-View\nNon-CLS 85.8 91.5\nCLS (ours) 87.1 93.2\nTable 2. Ablation study on class-token. Non-CLS denotes the\nprevious global average pooling method.\nEffect of Partition Encoding.To explore the effect of Par-\ntition Encoding, we remove the Partition Encoding module\nfrom the proposed pipeline, which increases the number of\ntokens by 5 times (from 5 parts to 25 joints) and conduct\nexperiments with different frame numbers.

Ablation study of data augmentation on NTU RGB+D\n60.\nNon-Partition Encoding (Non-PE), Partition Encoding (PE)\nimproves accuracy by 1.1% with much less computational\ncost, as shown in Table 3. Besides, PE enables the model\nto take sparser frames as temporal inputs, while the accu-\nracy of Non-PE drops by 1.9% when reducing the number\nof frames from 128 to 32, as shown in Table 3. In addition,\nwe compare the accuracy of methods [7,21,22,27] with dif-\nferent number of input frames, as shown in Figure 8. Our\nIIP-Transformer achieves comparable results with only 32\nframes.\nEffect of Data Augmentation.To evaluate the impact of\nthe proposed data augmentation strategies, we conduct ex-\nperiments with different data augmentation (see Table 4).\nApplying part-level data augmentation strategies( e.g., Ro-\ntation and Part-Mask) on X-Sub improves the accuracy\n7\nMethods X-Sub X-View X-Sub 120 X-Set 120 Param FLOPs\nST-LSTM [19] 69.2 77.7 55.7 57.9 - -\nHCN [17] 86.5 91.1 - - - -\nST-GCN [36] 81.5 88.3 - - 3.1M 16.3G\n2s-AGCN [26] 88.5 95.1 82.9 84.9 6.9M 37.3G\nAGC-LSTM [30] 89.2 95.0 - - 22.9M -\nPL-GCN [13] 89.2 95.0 - - 20.7M -\nDGNN [25] 89.9 96.1 - - 26.2M -\nShift-GCN [7] 90.7 96.5 85.9 87.6 2.8M 10.0G\nDC-GCN+ADG [6] 90.8 96.6 86.5 88.1 4.9M 25.7G\nPA-ResGCN-B19 [31] 90.9 96.0 87.3 88.3 3.6M 18.5G\nDynamic GCN [37] 91.5 96.0 87.3 88.6 14.4M -\nMS-G3D [21] 91.5 96.2 86.9 88.4 2.8M 48.8G\nMST-GCN [5] 91.5 96.6 87.5 88.8 12.0M -\nEfﬁcientGCN-B4 [32] 91.7 95.7 88.3 89.1 2.0M 15.2G\nST-TR [22] 89.9 96.1 82.7 84.7 12.1M 259.4G\nDSTA [27] 91.5 96.4 86.6 89.0 4.1M 64.7G\nIIP-Transformer 92.3 96.4 88.4 89.7 2.9M 7.2G\nTable 5. Comparison of top-1 accuracy (%), model size and computational complexity over different methods on the NTU RGB+D 60/120\ndatasets.\nby 0.8% and 1.3% respectively, and the best results are\nachieved when combining these two strategies. While\nthe effect of joint-level data augmentation ( e.g., Gaussian-\nNoise, Gaussian-Blur and Joint-Mask) is marginal. Intu-\nitively, the reason that Part-Mask strategy can effectively\nimprove the accuracy of the model is that it encourages the\nmodel to reason globally and reduce the dependency on any\nparticular part.\n4.4. Comparison with State of the Arts\nSimilar to most SOTA methods, we follow the same\nmulti-stream fusion strategies proposed in [7] for fair com-\nparison. We train four models with different modalities,\ne.g., joint, bone, joint motion, and bone motion respectively,\nthen average the softmax outputs from multiple streams to\nobtain the ﬁnal scores during inference. The comparison\nresults are shown in Table 5.\nAccuracy Comparison.First we compare our results with\nGCN-based methods [6,7,21,25,26,31,32,36,37]. Our pro-\nposed method outperforms the best GCN method by 0.6%\non X-sub of NTU RGB+D 60 and 0.6% on X-Set of NTU\nRGB+D 120 respectively. In terms of Transformer-based\nmethods [22, 27], our method also surpasses them on most\nof the metrics by a signiﬁcant margin.\nComplexity Comparison. We evaluate the computational\ncomplexity with FLOPs, e.g. the number of ﬂoating-point\nmultiplication-adds, and measure the model size with the\namount of parameters. The computational complexity of\nour proposed IIP-Transformer is 2.2 times less than ST-\nGCN [36] and 6.7 times less than MS-G3D [21], while the\nmodel sizes are similar. Comparing with the Transformer-\nbased methods, IIP-Transformer achieves superior results\nwith only a fraction of computational complexity and model\nsize.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this work, we propose a novel intra-inter-part trans-\nformer network (IIP-Transformer) for skeleton-based ac-\ntion recognition. It effectively captures inter-part and intra-\npart dependencies. Thanks to the part-level encoding and\nspatial-temporal separation, our method enjoys high efﬁ-\nciency. Besides, a part-level data augmentation namedPart-\nMask is proposed to encourage the model focus on global\nparts. On two large scale datasets, NTU RGB+D 60 & 120,\nthe proposed IIP-Transformer notably exceeds the current\nstate-of-the-art methods with 2 ∼36×less computational\ncost.\nReferences\n[1] Irwan Bello, Barret Zoph, Ashish Vaswani, Jonathon Shlens,\nand Quoc V Le.
