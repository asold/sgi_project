Its study often relies on in\nvivo or in vitro animal models, mathematical models, or computa-\ntional ( in silico ) models. Recent advances in the field of\nbioinformatics have provided a number of techniques for\nprocessing and integrating the explosion of data that has been\nproduced during the rise of genomics, which has also improved our\nability to predict the molecular specificities of the immune system\n(for a review see e.g., [1]). A number of mathematical models\nbased on either differential equations or interacting discrete entities\n(agents) have also been proposed to describe various aspects of the\nimmune system. However, most of the existing simulation-based\napproaches resort to oversimplified models of molecular interac-\ntions, because detailed quantitative data, needed for a more\nrealistic representation, were not always available.\nThe goal of the present work is to present a novel approach for\nthe study of the immune system, combining a mesoscopic scale\nsimulator of the immune system [2] with a set of machine learning\ntechniques for molecular-level predictions of major histocompat-\nibility complex–peptide binding interactions [3–6], linear B cell\nepitope discovery, as well as a more general protein–protein\npotential estimation [7]. More specifically, the computational\nmodel belongs to an agent-based class, whereas the prediction of\nepitopes relies on machine learning techniques, such as Neural\nNetworks (NN).\nThe paper is organized as follows: After an introduction to the\nfundamental mathematics required for modeling the immune\nsystem, we present results of simulations whose aim is to test the\ncorrectness the new tool. We concludes the paper with a\nperspective on the future of this work. Finally, the materials and\nmethods section describes the bioinformatics tools used for\npredicting the interactions among the entities involved in the\nimmune response, including a description of how they are\nincorporated into the mesoscopic C-I\nMMSIM simulator.\nIn silico models of the immune system\nThe immune system can be viewed as a classic system of\ncoupled components, with birth, death, and interaction elements.\nThe most common modeling approach utilizes systems of either\nOrdinary or Partial Differential Equations (ODE and PDE,\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9862\nrespectively) that directly describe the evolution of global\nquantities or populations over time [8]. In immunology, these\nquantities could be, for instance, the total concentration of viral\nparticles or cell counts. ODE- and PDE-based models enable a\nmodel to use well-established analytical and numerical techniques,\nbut they potentially oversimplify the system: an entire population\nof discrete entities is described by a single continuous variable.\nMathematical models based on differential equations have proved\nvery useful. The study of the evolution of HIV into AIDS, for\ninstance, has been modeled with the purpose of predicting the\neffects of specific treatments [9–12], and predicting certain aspects\nof disease progression [13–23].\nEach entity (e.g., a cell) is individually represented by an agent,\nand the interactions among agents are defined by a set of rules that\ncan have stochastic components. The rules reflect the current\nknowledge in immunology, but they can also be defined ad hoc to\ntest new hypotheses regarding the operation of the immune\nsystem.\nOne of the first attempts to define a detailed agent-based model\nof immunological mechanisms was the work of Celada and Seiden\n[2,24,25]. Their goal was to capture the dynamics of the immune\nsystem, as much as possible, and to perform experiments in silico.\nAlong similar lines, a study of the thymus has been carried out\n[26]. This approach provided important insights into the\nregulation of positive and negative selection and into the dynamics\nof the production of the TCR repertoire in the thymus. More\nrecently, we have developed specialized versions of the Celada-\nSeiden model to study HIV-1 infection, EBV infection, hypersen-\nsitivity reactions, and cancer immunoprevention (described,\nrespectively, in [27–30]). Recentely, another implementation of\nthe same model has been used to study cross reactivity and\nheterologous memory [31].\nC-I\nMMSIM, the simulator that implements our version of the\nCelada-Seiden model, is a flexible tool that can be used for the study\nof a number of different immunological processes. The original\nmodel used bit strings to represent the receptors of biological entities.\nRelated works\nRecently, there has been renewed interest in modeling the\nimmune system by means of agent-based models.\nSimmune [32] aims at being a flexible platform for the\nsimulation of any immunological process. It is more of a modeling\ntechnique and a language for the description of models than a\nspecific model. Simmune is based on a particular representation of\nparticle interactions that can be used to create detailed models of\nthe immune system. The particles live on a mesh, and their states\nare updated at discrete time-steps so that both time and space are\ndiscrete. Particles in Simmune can be in different states.\nTransitions among the states are probabilistic events triggered\nby the exchange of messenger particles having a limited range. The\nmessenger field intensities are calculated by the integration of\nreaction-diffusion equations and typically include an activation\nthreshold. A major advantage of Simmune is that it models both\ndirect intercellular interactions (such as those between an antigen\nand a B cell) and interactions mediated by molecular messengers\n(such as lymphokines). It also supports spatial compartmentaliza-\ntion and communication conduits.\nThe Basic Immune Simulator (Bis) [33] is an agent-based model\ncreated to study the interactions among the cells of the innate and\nadaptive immune systems. Bis simulates basic cell types, mediators,\nand antibodies, and consists of three virtual spaces representing\nparenchymal tissue, secondary lymphoid tissue, and the lymphat-\nic/humoral circulation. Bis translates mechanistic cellular and\nmolecular knowledge regarding the innate and adaptive immune\nresponse and reproduces the immune system’s complex behavioral\npatterns. It has been used both as an educational tool to\ndemonstrate the emergence of those patterns and as a research\ntool to systematically identify potential targets for more effective\ntreatment strategies for diseases processes, including hypersensi-\ntivity reactions, autoimmunity, and cancer.\nSimisys [34] is a cellular automata-based method that allows the\nsimulation of tens of thousands of cells. Both innate and adaptive\ncomponents of the immune system are represented. Specifically,\nmacrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, natural killer cells, B\ncells, T helper cells, complement proteins, and pathogenic bacteria\nare present in the model.\nBit string models of immune diversity\nA fundamental task of the immune system is to recognize and\nbind antigens by means of cell receptors. The binding mechanism\nis based on physical–chemical processes (short-range non-covalent\ninteractions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions) [8].\nThe features that determine the binding among molecules [35]\nmay be represented by a shape-space. Under the assumption that the\nshape-space can be described by means of K parameters, a point\nin this K-dimensional space specifies the generalized shape of a\nbinding region. Oster and Perelson estimated that in order to be\ncomplete, the receptor repertoire should fulfill the following\nconditions: i) each receptor should recognize a set of related\nepitopes, each of which differs slightly in shape; ii) the repertoire\nsize should be on the order of 10\n16 or larger; iii) at least one subset\nof the repertoire should be distributed randomly throughout the\nshape-space. Later, Farmer and co-workers [36] introduced the\nidea of using binary strings to represent the generalized shape of a\nreceptor. To determine the degree of affinity between bit-strings, it\nis possible to resort to different string-matching criteria. For\ninstance, by using a key–lock analogy, two binary strings have a\nhigh affinity if they complement each other, that is, when the two\nstrings are lined up, every ‘‘0’’ in one string corresponds to a ‘‘1’’ in\nthe other, and conversely. The bit string representation of antigen\nand cell receptor diversity was then adopted by a number of other\nauthors [37–39], and has been the basis for the description of all\nmolecular interactions in earlier implementations of the Celada-\nSeiden model.\nPrevious version of C-ImmSim\nThe C-IMMSIM model of the immune system response has been\nquite extensively described in [27,40]. C-ImmSim was imple-\nmented in ANSI C language. In short, it consists of a three-\ndimensional (3D) stochastic cellular automaton in which the major\nclasses of cells of both the lymphoid (T helper lymphocytes (Th),\ncytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), B lymphocytes, and antibody-\nproducer plasma cells, PLB) and the myeloid lineage (macrophag-\nes (Mw) and dendritic cells (DC)) are represented. All these entities\ninteract with each other according to a set of rules that describe\nthe different phases of the recognition and response processes of\nthe immune system against a pathogen.\nC-I\nMMSIM can be classified as a bit-string polyclonal lattice\nmodel. Bit-string refers to the way in which the molecules are\nrepresented, polyclonal indicates that the lymphocytes have\ngenetic variation in their receptors, and lattice signifies that a\ndiscrete lattice is used to represent the space.\nThe model mainly represents a portion of a tertiary organ such\nas a lymph node, tonsil, or spleen. Tertiary organs are sites in\nwhich antigens are presented to immune cells. C-I MMSIM\nsimultaneously simulates three compartments that represent three\nseparate anatomical regions found in mammals: (i) the bone\nmarrow, where hematopoietic stem cells are simulated, which\nComputational Bioinformatics\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9862\nproduce new lymphoid and myeloid cells; (ii) the thymus, where\nnaı¨ve T cells are selected to avoid auto-reactivity; and (iii) a tertiary\nlymphatic organ, such as a lymph node. The tertiary organ is the\nonly compartment that is described geometrically, because it is\nmapped onto a 3D lattice. All interactions among cells and\nmolecules take place on a lattice-site during each time step. The\ndiffusion of entities at each time step models the physical spreading\nof molecules in the lymphatic organ.\nA set of self peptides is used to define the ‘‘self’’ at the beginning\nof the simulation. Non-self is defined as everything else. Potential\npathogens as well as cell receptors and MHC molecules (the HLA\nor Human Leukocyte Antigen), are represented as binary strings.\nIn the model, all cells are considered ‘active’ or ‘resting’. This\nmeans that naı¨ve cells are not taken into account. Hence, all cells\nreaching the tertiary organ (the simulation space) are already\nmature. T-lymphocytes are exceptions, because they undergo\nthymic selection before entering circulation. The lymphocytes\ngenerated in the bone marrow have a high diversity with respect to\ntheir receptors, due to alternative splicing , which is somatic\nrearrangement of noncontiguous genomic V, J, and C regions,\nand sometimes hypermutation. We represent this phenomenon by\nassigning random bit-string receptors to every lymphocyte.\nC-I\nMMSIM incorporates the following working hypothesis or\ntheories: i) the diversity of specific elements [41–43]; ii) antigen\nprocessing and presentation [44–47]; iii) MHC restriction [48]; iv)\ncell–cell cooperation [49,50]; v) maturation of the response and\nmemory [51,52]; vi) clonal selection by antigen affinity ([53]); vii)\nthymus education of T lymphocytes (clonal deletion theory, [54]);\nviii) hypermutation of antibodies; ix) Hayflick limit (T cell\nreplicative senescence [55–58]); x) Ag dose-induced tolerance\n(anergy) in B cells [59,60].\nxi) T cell anergy [61];\nxii) Matzinger’s danger signals [62];\nxiii) Idiotypic Network theory [63]. Further information can be\nfound in the literature.\nResults\nIn the remainder of this section, we describe some numerical\nexperiments that were designed with the goal of assessing the\nsoundness of the simulator. The average execution time was\naround three hours on a 2.4 GHz Opteron processor. In terms of\nmemory consumption, the simulation of a 10 microliter volume\nrequires 1 GB of RAM.\nImmunization experiment\nIn this experiment, we reproduce the typical immunization\nprocess by injecting an immunogenic protein at two subsequent\ninstants in time. The actual AA string used as an antigenic\nmolecule is the gag molecule from HIV-1.\nThe antigen is injected at time zero, then again six months (of\nsimulated time) later. The system develops a typical primary and\nsecondary immune response with a significant increase in memory\nlymphocytes, as shown in Figure 1. Panel (a) and panel (b) show,\nrespectively, the cell counts of B and T helper lymphocytes in a\ncubic millimeter. The immunological memory is developed during\nthe first response. Therefore, the second response is much more\nrapid, as can be seen in the inset plot of panel (c), which shows the\ntime the immune system takes to clear the antigen. The same\npanel also shows the humoral response in terms of antibody titers\n(arbitrary scale). In summary, the dynamics are consistent with a\nrealistic immunization process, because they show a faster\nsecondary response due to the development of long-lasting\nmemory.\nImmunodominance or affinity maturation\nIn this experiment, we test the emergence of one or more\ndominating clones of lymphocytes in the situation of chronic\nexposure to the same immunogenic molecule. In other words, we\ncheck if the system reproduces the phenomenon of affinity\nmaturation. To mimic chronic exposure to a pathogen, we\nrepeatedly inject a certain amount of the HIV/gag protein (for\nexample) throughout the simulation period.\nThe system responds by mounting a specific immune response\nfrom the beginning of exposure. Then, as the simulation proceeds,\nhigher affinity clones overtake the original clones with respect to\nexpression levels, eventually proliferating at higher levels than any\nother. This is shown in Figure 2, in which the lymphocyte T helper\ncount for the top-ranked clones is shown alongside the specific\nTCRs. Note, in particular, that the dashed line corresponds to the\nfirst emerging clone, and the continuous line shows a later-\nappearing clone with a better affinity that overcomes the first\nclone. In the inset plot of the same figure, we show the Simpson\nindex D~P\ni (ni=N)2, where N~P\ni ni and ni is the count of the\nclone with specificity i. The increase of the index D over time\nindicates the emergence of a dominating clone (i.e., the bigger the\nvalue of D, the lower the diversity).\nHomozygote vs heterozygote\nThere are reasons to believe that the ‘‘time to AIDS’’ in HIV-\ninfected patients is related to the haplotype homozygosity [64].\nIndividuals that bear a higher diversity in their MHC have slower\nprogression to AIDS than those with lower diversity. In the\nanalysis carried out by Carrington [64], individuals carrying\nheterozygosity for HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C each showed a\nlonger AIDS-free period compared to their homozygote locus\ncounterparts. Here, we simulate the situation and compare the\ntime to clear a given antigen (not specifically the HIV-1) for\nindividuals with full heterozygosity and individuals with homozy-\ngosity for their MHC loci. The heterozygote haplotype is a full\nheterozygote, meaning that we allow all possible loci to be\ndifferent. The homozygotes bear one A- allele, one B- allele, and\none DR- allele. The following set of MHCs have been used,\nfollowing the article by Hoof et al., in which MHC alleles are\nranked based on observed viremia levels in HIV-I-infected patients\n[65]: homozygote genotype: A /C3 0201, B /C3 5304, DRB3 /C3 0302;\nheterozygote genotype: A /C3 0201, A /C3 0301, B /C3 5304,B/C3 5309,\nDRB3/C3 0302,DRB5/C3 0202.\nThe antigen used encompassed all proteins from the Flu\ninfluenza A serotype H1N1 (genome id: HU13275) in the flu\ngenome database (www.flugenome.org). For demonstration pur-\nposes, we assume that the virus does not mutate. The results of\nsimulations, shown in Figure 3, indeed show that the speed of\nantigen clearance is faster for simulations with a heterozygote\nhaplotype. It is also worth noting that the immune effort calculated\nas the number of cells (both CTLs and CD4\nz T-cells) during the\nimmune response is higher for the homozygote-type, consistent\nwith the fact that the homozygote immune response is poorer and,\ntherefore, allows the virus to grow to higher numbers before it is\ncleared. The opposite situation holds for the heterozygote immune\nsystem, which optimally clears the virus faster and with less effort.\nDiscussion\nWe have presented an integrated multi-level model that\ndescribes the immune system response at the mesoscopic level\nand, at the same time, takes into account the recognition\nmechanisms among molecules by means of prediction tools based,\nin part, on well known techniques for epitope discovery.\nComputational Bioinformatics\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9862\nWe have tested the simulator in typical immunization\nexperiments, in which the immune system develops memory.\nWe have shown that the system develops affinity maturation\nagainst ‘‘chronic’’ antigenic peptides, and we have also shown that\nheterozygosity helps the immune system to cope with the diversity\nof pathogens. These results show that the simulator produces\ndynamics that are consistent with previous versions of C-I\nMMSIM.\nAdditionally, the simulation extends those results by using AA\nstrings, adding a considerable quantity of information. This feature\nprecisely describes the added value of a tool of this kind.\nThe novelty and the power of our approach lie in the use of a\ncombination of two levels of description to study the immune\nresponse by means of computer simulation. The first level is a\nmesoscopic agent-based model representing cooperating cells that\nmount an immune response. The second level is a set of molecular\nbinding prediction methods that are used to compute the binding\naffinity of the molecules represented in the agent-based model.\nThe combination of these tools allows us to perform in silico\nimmunization experiments with specific real-world proteins and\ncould help to speed up drug design or clinically oriented research.\nThe system also provides a framework for testing various\nprediction methods, because the two levels of description,\nmolecular interactions and cellular interactions, have purposefully\nbeen kept separate in the computer code. This implies that a novel\nmethod for predicting B cell epitopes could, for example, be easily\ninserted into the simulator with minimal programming effort, and\nthe consequences could be immediately analyzed by looking at the\nresulting immune dynamics.\nFurther work will focus on optimizing the procedures and\nfinding better algorithms for prediction of B cell epitopes. The\nMiyazawa-Kernigan potential, which we have used to predict the\nbinding affinity between generic AA strings, can also be replaced\nwith a more accurate prediction method, should one become\navailable. The proposed architecture has been developed with\nconsideration for the issue of upgradability and modularity so that\nnew prediction methods can be easily inserted and used.\nFigure 1.

For\nexample, it is possible to investigate why one particular epitope of\na given antigen is more immunogenic than another. Does the\nuptake by the APCs determine this quality due to differences in\npresentation on MHCs, or to differences in ligation through\nimmuno receptors? It is also possible to combine this kind of\nanalysis with simulations of different types of pathogenic behavior\nand to study the cross-reactivity in the development of the flu\nvaccine to select for the best combination of known viral peptides\nto be used in order to achieve better protection. These are just a\nfew possible works that we are planning to pursue in the near\nfuture.\nMaterials and Methods\nAt the molecular level, a key step for the simulation of the\nimmune response is the prediction of immunogenicity. Only the\nimmunogenic parts of an invading pathogen will trigger an\nimmune response in the affected host. Those parts are called\nepitopes and are pathogen-dependent.\nMolecular binding\nIn the specific context of the pathogen-induced immune\nresponse, one distinguishes between B cell and T cell epitopes. B\ncell epitopes are recognized by immunoglobulins, also known as\nantibodies. The immunogenic parts are often located on the\nsurface of pathogenic proteins, because they have to be accessible\nfor binding. The epitopes mostly consist of discontinuous blocks of\nthe antigen sequence, i.e., sequence segments that are distantly\nseparated in the protein sequence and are brought into proximity\nupon folding into tertiary or quaternary structures. The binding of\na B cell epitope to a B cell receptor (BCR, an immunoglobulin\ncovalently attached to the B cell surface) augmented by T helper\ncell induction triggers the differentiation of naı ¨ve B cells into\nantibody-secreting plasma cells that make up the humoral immune\nresponse. T cells can be divided into T helper cells (TH) and\ncytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL or TC). T helper cells act as\nmediators between antigen presenting cells (APC) and plasma\ncells, and, therefore, assume a central role in the immune\nFigure 3.

Panels (b), (c), and (d) show that the immune effort calculated as the maximum number of cells (both CTLs,\nCD4\nz T-cells) during the immune response, is higher for the homozygote type.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009862.g003\nFigure 2.

CTLs kill infected host cells by means of cytotoxic\neffector molecules that are released upon recognition of a complex\non the surface of the infected cells. The complex consists of an\nepitope and an MHC class I molecule.\nCTL epitopes are generated from cytosolic proteins. These\npeptides result from the antigen processing pathway that involves\ndegradation by the proteasome, transport into the endoplasmic\nreticulum via the transporter associated with antigen processing\n(TAP), and presentation by MHC class I molecules. This\nprocessing takes place in all cells containing a nucleus. The\nMHC class II molecules, on the other hand, are produced only by\nAPCs, which include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells.\nEpitope binding to MHC class II molecules are generated from\ninternalized proteins that are degraded in acidified endocytic\nvesicles.\nPrediction methods\nThe immune system recognizes pathogens by means of their\nepitopes. As such, a protein belonging to a pathogen can be seen as\na collection of parts that are either epitopes or non-epitopes. The\nbinding strength of an epitope to a cell’s receptor is one of the\nfactors that determines the activation and strength of the immune\nresponse. For the last several years, we have developed\ncomputational methods that can predict T cell epitopes [3,4,6]\nor B cell epitopes [66,67] in protein sequences. Although the\nneural networks for MHC prediction, developed in [3,4,6], seem\nto outperform other networks and methods [68,69], it should be\nnoted that these methods are not perfect. They cannot always\nprovide the same level of accuracy as experimentally-generated\ndata across all MHC alleles. Moreover, we assume that a peptide\nbound on the surface of an MHC molecule always triggers the\nimmune system, which is not necessarily the case [70].\nBy implementing protein sequence-based representations for\nboth the host and the pathogen, we may obtain a patient-specific\ngenomic model capable of making specific predictions for different\nhost/antigen genotype combinations.\nUntil now, C-I\nMMSIM worked by using algorithms that represent\nthe biological complexity using bit strings. If protein sequences\nrather than bit strings are used, different methods, such as Neural\nNetworks, are needed to predict binding. The switch from bits to\namino acids (AA) requires new algorithms to compute the affinity\namong strings. Because C-I\nMMSIM is an agent-based model, every\nagent (e.g., any cell), along with its interactions, is individually\nsimulated. This level of representation produces millions of\nbindings in a typical simulation. For this reason, we developed a\nnew, fast Position Specific Scoring Matrix(PSSM)-based method, with\nminimal sacrifices with respect to the prediction of performance.\nTo assess the predicting power of the matrices, a large set of\nquantitative peptide MHC binding data were downloaded from\nthe IEDB database [71]. The dataset consists of 6,533 peptides\nand covers 33 HLA- A and HLA-B human alleles. The PSSMs\nwere calculated as described above, using the original NetMHC-\npan method trained only on human data. None of the peptides in\nthe evaluation set were included in the training set. For each allele,\nthe predictive performance of the corresponding PSSM was\nevaluated in terms of the Pearson’s correlation between the log-\ntransformed [72] IC50 value and the summed PSSM prediction\nscore. Although the NetMHCPan method almost systematically\noutperforms the PSSM, the use of the latter in C-I\nMMSIM is\njustified by the gain in computational speed.\nThe matrix method we employ has, on average, a Pearson’s\ncorrelation coefficient of 0.56 with respect to experimental data,\nwhereas the original NN performance was 0.62 (see Table 1) [73].\nOne of the major requirements for the integration of the\nprediction methods with an agent-based simulator is the\ndevelopment of tools that calculate the stability of molecular\ncomplexes.\nBecause there is no general method that can be used to predict\nif, for example, a TCR will interact with any given MHC–peptide\ncomplex, we have used the Miyazawa-Jernigan residue–residue\npotential [74] to score the strength of the interaction.\nIn the following sections, we present the implementation and\ncombination of each of these processes. For a better understand-\ning, it is important to consider that each lymphocyte in the\nsimulation bears a receptor (called BCR for B cells, TCR\nfor both THs and CTLs), and APCs contain a definition of\nHLA class I and II molecules with which they are equipped.\nMoreover, interactions among cells can be either nonspecific (e.g.,\nmacrophages engulfing antigens) or specific. Specific interactions\nmust be accounted for when antibodies meet antigens or when\nT-cells interact with other cells presenting foreign peptides on their\nMHC.\nAn antigen is defined by a part or by the entire proteome, i.e., a\nset of protein sequences imported via one or more FASTA files\n(http://www.proteomecommons.org/data/fasta/fasta.jsp).\nWe make use of the following definitions. Let V be the\nset of AA symbols, that is, V~fA,R,N,D,C,Q,E,G,H,I,L,K,M,\nF,P,S,T,W,Y,Vg. EVE~20 indicates the number of elements in\nV. Let a~½a\n1,a2, ... ,al(a)/C138 (where ai[V) represent a contiguous\nstretch of AAs, where l(a) indicates the length of the sequence and\nak the kth AA in the sequence.\nIn the following, we use p to indicate peptides, whereas we use\neB, eI , and eII to indicate epitopes for B cells, CTLs, and TH cells,\nrespectively.\nTable 1.Comparison of the predictive performance of the\nPSSM and NetMHCpan methods.\nAllele N PSSM NetMHCpan\nA0101 446 0.705 0.789\nA0201 442 0.641 0.724\nA0301 329 0.584 0.638\nA1101 217 0.646 0.684\nA2301 329 0.553 0.568\nA2402 367 0.519 0.527\nA2403 111 0.592 0.653\nA2601 428 0.747 0.821\nA2902 329 0.500 0.520\nA3002 329 0.539 0.473\nA3101 224 0.629 0.759\nA3301 224 0.561 0.700\nA6801 224 0.632 0.780\nB0801 119 0.481 0.543\nB1501 114 0.336 0.424\nB3901 106 0.445 0.508\nB4001 230 0.679 0.733\nB5801 102 0.389 0.435\nAverage 6533 0.560 0.620\nThe columns give the allele name, number of peptide data points N, and the\nperformance of the PSSM and NetMHCpan methods, respectively.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009862.t001\nComputational Bioinformatics\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9862\nClass I epitopes\nClass I-type epitopes are linear sequences of 8 to 11 amino acids\nthat are processed from any protein of the pathogen via the\nprocess described in section. Each MHC class I molecule, whose\ntotal number surpasses the thousands of alleles to date [5], is\ncharacterized by a specific binding motif that is possible to\n‘‘decode’’. For the vast majority, the motif length is nine AAs long\n(Figure 4). Class I T cell epitope prediction methods rely on\nmachine learning techniques. In previous work, we showed that\nquantitative NNs, which had been trained to predict binding\nversus non-binding peptides, are superior to the conventional NNs\n[72]. Furthermore, quantitative NNs allow the straightforward\napplication of a query by committee (QBC) principle, in which\nparticularly information-rich peptides can be identified and\nsubsequently tested experimentally. Iterative training based on\nQBC-selected peptides considerably increases the sensitivity\nwithout compromising the efficiency of the predictions [75].\nBecause we want to handle generic proteins, the portions of a\nprotein that trigger an immune response must be identified. To this\npurpose, we use the binding motif matrices generated from the NN\nmethods described in [5]. In short, we rank a set of one million\nrandomly selected natural peptides from the human genome using\nt h eN Nm e t h o d ;t h et o po n ep e r c e n to ft h ep e p t i d e sf l a g g e da s\nbinders are used to generate a binding motif, i.e., a 9 by 20 matrix.\nThe matrix is calculated using sequence weights, and is corrected for\nlow counts [4,76]. The average score of the low-scoring binders in\nthe top one percent is set as a threshold value for the matrix. This\nthreshold is then used to discriminate between epitopes and non\nepitopes as follows.\nThe propensity is calculated as 2 log\n2 (P=Q), where P is the\nprobability of finding a given AA at a given position, and Q is the\nprobability of finding that AA in any protein in general. These\npropensities are computed for each of the nine positions on a\npotential epitope, and give the propensity for each of the 20 AAs.\nEach matrix represents an approximation of the underlying NN,\nbut the matrix representation is computationally much faster than\nthe computation of the NN directly. Each row of the matrix\nrepresents a position in the 9-mer, and the columns correspond to\nthe scores for that specific AA (an example is given in Table 2).\nFor a given 9-mer p~½a\n1,a2, ... ,a9/C138 , ai[V, the sum of the\nvalues at each position in the scoring matrix gives a score. That is,\nlet fB\nI\ni,aj g with i~1, ... ,9 and aj[V,j~1, ... ,EVE, be the matrix\nof a specific class I MHC allele. The score of a generic 9-mer\npeptide p is given by\n~SS(p)~\nX\n9\ni~1\nBI\ni,ai : ð1Þ\nMHC class I peptide detection\nWe next describe how the scoring matrices for alleles are used in\nthe simulation. For an antigenic molecule Ag~½a1,a2, ... ,al/C138 , (we\nassume l§9), all possible peptides of the protein are found by\ntaking a sliding window of length 9, that is, all possible 9-mers are\nfp1,p2, ... ,pl{8g~f½a1, ... ,a9/C138 ,½a2, ... ,a10/C138 , ... ,½al{8, ... ,al/C138g :\nFor each 9-mer pk,k~1, ... ,l{8, eq(1) computes the score of the\npeptide ~SS(pk). Of all possible 9-mers, those for which ~SS(p)§HBI ,\nwhere HBI is the allele-specific threshold, are considered epitopes.\nHence, the epitope profile is\n^SS(p1),^SS(p2), ... ,^SS(pl{8), Vi~1, ... ,l{8,\n^SS(pi)~\n~SS(pi){HBI if ~SS(pi)§HBI ,\n0 otherwise :\n( ð2Þ\nNote that 0ƒnƒl{8, that is, n can also be zero, meaning that\nno epitopes are found in the antigen AA sequence. The threshold\nH\nBI is computed as follows: for the set of peptides used to compute\nthe matrix for each allele, the matrix predictions for binding\naffinity are calculated. Next, we extract the 1% strongest binders,\ni.e., those with a high affinity for the MHC. Some of these 1%\nhave a lower binding affinity than others. We consider the 10\nweakest binders of this subset to have a low-end binding affinity,\nand we average these binding scores to get H\nBI . We assume that in\na random set of peptides, around 1% have a binding affinity below\n500 nM for the MHC and are considered binders [72,77]. An\nexample is provided in Figure 4.\nClass II epitopes\nClass II-type epitopes are presented only on the surface of\nAPCs. For MHC class II epitope detection, we resort to the same\nmethodology used for class I. It is known that class II epitopes\nhave lengths that vary by up to 30 AA [78,79]. An analysis of all\nknown class II human binders from the EPIMHC database reveals\nthat the average class II epitope is 16 residues +4:2 in length\n(note that the total number of epitopes found to bind human\nMHCs was 2503 as of March 2008) [78]. Still, the binding core of\nthe peptides presented by the MHC can be reduced to a 9-mer\nwith flanking regions of variable length as demonstrated by\nNielsen [80]. This means that MHC class II epitope detection\ncan rely on the same principles as class I epitope detection. To\nthis end, in analogy to section, we created a set of matrices, B\nII,\nable to score any given 9-mer for each allele covered by the NN\nmethod.\nFigure 4.

The 9-mers\nform only the core of the binding peptide, the variability in alleles\nis much wider than in class I alleles, and the available prediction\nmethods do not match the prediction capabilities of MHC class I\npredictors [69]. To remedy these problems, we focused on a\nlimited set of MHC class II alleles for which good predictions exist,\nand selected those available in the TEPITOPE method [81].\nB cell epitope\nThe prediction of discontinuous B cell epitopes is still a major\nchallenge in vaccine design, and is difficult for two reasons: first,\navailable data on discontinuous epitopes in different antigens is\nscarce compared to the available data on linear epitopes; second,\nfew antigens are completely annotated with respect to multiple\ndiscontinuous epitopes in a single antigen. The presence of epitopes\nthat are not annotated in the data set increases the difficulties\nassociated with assessing the performance of prediction algorithms.\nDue to these difficulties, the majority of prediction tools\navailable for B cell epitopes are based on linear prediction\nmethods. These are limited to continuous stretches of protein\nsequences that may, in the end, be combined to form one or\nseveral conformational epitopes.\nMost tools available for the prediction of linear B cell epitopes\nuse propensity scale methods. These methods assign a propensity\nvalue to each AA in the queried protein sequence based on\nknowledge of the AAs physical and chemical properties. Propensity\nscales have been developed based on antigenicity, hydrophilicity,\ninverted hydrophobicity, accessibility, and secondary structure. As\npart of the development of a new prediction method for linear B\ncell epitopes, we tested all such scales for their ability to predict B\ncell epitopes in an annotated data set taken from Pellequer et al.\n[82]. It turns out that the propensity scales of Parker (based on\nhydrophilicity) [83]. and Levitt (based on the secondary structure)\nshow better performance compared to other scales.\nFor the present work, we decided to use the Parker\nhydrophilicity method rather than the BepiPred method because\nthe former is simpler and the performance gain using BepiPred is\nmarginal [66].\nB cell epitope detection\nThe Parker propensity scale [83] is used to find B cell epitopes\nin a generic antigenic sequence.

We\nthen create a score profile for the sequence, ^SS\nk~^SS(ak),\nk~1, ... ,l, as follows:\n^SS1~1\n4 (P(a1)zP(a2)zP(a3)zP(a4)),\n^SS2~1\n5 (P(a1)zP(a2)zP(a3)zP(a4)zP(a5)),\n^SS3~1\n6 (P(a1)zP(a2)zP(a3)zP(a4)zP(a5)zP(a6)),\n^SSj~1\n7\nX3\nk~{3\nP(ajzk), j~4, ... ,l{3,\n^SSl{2~1\n6 (P(al{5)zP(al{4)zP(al{3)zP(al{2)\nzP(al{1)zP(al)),\n^SSl{1~1\n5 (P(al{4)zP(al{3)zP(al{2)zP(al{1)zP(al)),\n^SSl~1\n4 (P(al{3)zP(al{2)zP(al{1)zP(al)):\nThe profile is used to discriminate between residues that are likely\nto be part of an epitope and those that are not. We use a minimum\nscore threshold Hparker\nVi~1, ... ,l, Si~\n^SSi if ^SSi§Hparker,\n0 otherwise,\n(\nwhere Hparker is 0.7. This value gives the best correlation between\npredicted and real epitopes in the dataset used in [66]. Finally, we\nlabel only contiguous regions of AAs, with profiles above the\nthreshold and lengths that are at least four, as possible B cell\nepitopes. We call e1\nB, ... ,en\nB, 0ƒnƒl the B cell epitopes found.\nCombined model\nThe simulation of the full sequence of system events, from\nantigenic injection to the immune response, proceeds via antigen\nrecognition by lymphocyte receptors.\nThe contact potential of Miyazawa and Jernigan\nThere are no prediction tools available for describing specific\nbinding among BCRs, antigen epitopes, TCRs, and generic\nMHC-peptides (both class I and class II). Therefore, we had to\ndefine, in C-I MMSIM, a generic contact potential among AA\nsequences to be used in those cases.\nThe work performed by Miyazawa and Jernigan on protein\nenergy potentials [84] provides us with a method for assessing\nthe chances of direct interactions among proteins in the\nsimulation. The protein–protei n potential concept was derived\nfrom the analysis of 3D structures in which the relative position\nof AAs were determined. The contact potential matrix\nestimated by Miyazawa and Jernigan reflects the entropy\nbetween two residues. A low entropy means that the pair of\nresidues has low energy and, therefore, that interaction is\npossible.\nThe contact potential defined between two AA strings is, thus,\nbased on the Miyazawa-Jernigan score. In the simulation, this\nmeasure is used both when a BCR meets an antigen and when a\nTCR meets an MHC-peptide complex. For the case of BCR, we\nuse a mean field approach, meaning that we assess the potential of\nthe whole BCR against the B cell epitope.\nLet fM\na,bg, with a,b[V, be the matrix found in [84]. If e1 is a\nBCR and e2 is a B cell epitope, then we use the following formula:\n^MM(e1,e2)~\nXl(e1)\nj~1\nXl(e2)\nk~1\nMe1\nj ,e2\nk\n: ð5Þ\nFor T-cell recognition, the procedure is different because it\nrequires the definition of a class of specific contact matrices CI and\nCII for class I and class II, respectively.\nWe precomputed the contact matrices from known protein 3D\nstructures found in the Protein Data Bank (www.pdb.org) taking\nresidues that i) are within a distance of 5 A˚ and, ii) show contacts\nbetween the MHC-epitope complex and the two chains (heavy\nand light) of a bound TCR. The distance of 5 A ˚ was selected\nbecause most crystal structures with experimentally verified B cell\nepitopes show that the residues on the antibody in contact with an\nepitope lie within a 5 A˚ radius. We extend the use of this value to\nthe minimum distance needed between residues for molecular\ninteraction. By using the solved structures, it is possible to\nTable 3.Parker’s propensity scale (from [83]).\na [ V RDE K S N Q G P T\nP(a) 0.87 2.46 1.86 1.26 1.50 1.64 1.37 1.28 0.3 1.15\nAH C M V I L Y F W\n0.03 0.30 0.11 21.41 21.27 22.45 22.87 20.78 22.78 23.00\nFor each AA a[V, the propensity is indicated by P(a)[R.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009862.t003\nComputational Bioinformatics\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9862\ndetermine which residues on a TCR bind to the MHC and\npeptide, and which should be considered to be in the MHC–\npeptide complex. The contact matrix derived for class I binding is\nrepresented in Figure 5.\nTherefore, if e1 is a TCR, e2 is a MHC-peptide complex, and\nCI , CII are the contact matrices used for class I and class II\nrespectively, the binding affinity between the residues is\n^MM(e1,e2)~\nXl(e1)\nj~1\nXl(e2)\nk~1\n(Me1\nj ,e2\nk\n:CfI;IIg\ne1\nj ,e2\nk\n): ð6Þ\nNow, in order to determine effective thresholds for the\ninteraction strengths defined above, in eq(5) and eq(6), we\nobserved that, given two randomly chosen AA strings a[Vn and\nb[Vm,( n and m also taken at random), the score ^MM(a,b) follows a\nGaussian distribution with average m ^MM ~m ^MM (n,m) and standard\ndeviation s ^MM ~s ^MM (n,m). Therefore, we pre-estimated those\nvalues of m and s for a wide range of n and m, and we defined\nthe normalized score as follows:\nM\n0\n(e1,e2)~m ^MM { ^MM(e1,e2)\ns ^MM\n:\n(Note that ^MM is negative.)\nNext, we select those with a normalized score above threshold\nHMJ as potential binders (i.e., positive probability), i.e.,\nM(e1,e2)~ M’(e1,e2)i f M’(e1,e2)§HMJ,\n0 otherwise :\n(\nð7Þ\nThe threshold value of HMJ determines the number of reactive\nclones and was estimated to 0.075 so that in a typical\nimmunization experiment, antigen clearance is obtained in a time\nframe of a few days. We use M(e1,e2) of eq(7) as the probability to\ndecide if e1 binds e2.\nPutting all parts together: The simulation of immune\nrecognition\nThe simulation follows the same procedure as in the original bit-\nstring version [40], with the significant difference being that antigen\nrecognition and binding rely on the epitope prediction methods\ndescribed above. In the new model, we represent pathogens at the\nprotein level by their AA sequences, which means that we implicitly\naccount for only transcribed DNA. The host’s genotype is defined\nby a set of four MHC class I and class II alleles.\nThe space volume is populated with an initial number of\nentities. Lymphocytes are generated with a random AA receptor of\nlength 48 for BCRs and 32 for TCRs.\nThe sequence of events culminating in the immune response\n(either humoral, cytotoxic, or both) is described in the following.\n1. The Ag represented by one or more AA strings is injected;\nN the B cell epitopes e1\nB, ... ,en\nB are probed. Here we use the\nmethod described in section;\nN for each MHC of class I and II, the T-cell epitopes\n^SS(p1), ... ,^SS(pn) are found and scored (see section and\nsection);\n2. Phagocytosis by antigen processing cells;\nN Mw s and DCs perform unspecific phagocytosis of Ag;\nN B cells must recognize, with their B cell receptor BCR, at\nleast one epitope of the Ag. Phagocytosis happens with a\nprobability p defined as follows:\n– Given the precomputed B cell epitopes e1, ... ,en,w e\ncalculate, for a B cell receptor BCR, the score\n^SS(ei\nB)~M(BCR,ei\nB) by means of the MJ method, and\nnormalize those scores as described in eq(7) to get\nS(e1\nB), ... ,S(en\nB).\nFinally, the probability that a B cell will recognize\nat least one of the epitopes is calculated as\np~1{Pn\ni~1 (1{S(ei\nB)), that is, the probability for the\nBCR to match at least one epitope of the antigen;\n3. Antigen digestion by APCs. Once an APC (M w, DC, and B\ncell) has internalized the antigen, it is processed as follows:\nN Because the epitopes e1\nII , ... ,en\nII have been determined as\ndescribed in section, we can randomly select. This selection\nis performed by means of the random wheel selectionprocedure:\ndraw a number u between 0 and 1 with a uniform\nprobability distribution and select r if S(er{1\nII )ƒuvS(er\nII ).\nOne epitope er\nII , with a probability that is given by the\nnormalized score S(er\nII );\nFigure 5.

The\nmatrix was derived using the structure indexed under the reference\n1OGA in the PDB database. Labels on the columns report the position\nindices for the residues in the two TCR chains as they are numbered in\nthe PDB file (chains E and D respectively). Rows: Labels report the\nposition indices for the MHC residues and the peptide (chains A and C,\nrespectively, in the structure file).

In the program, this matrix is\ncoded with ones (blue dot) and zeros (no dot).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009862.g005\nComputational Bioinformatics\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9862\nN Analogously to the endocytotic digestion, endogenous\ndigestion takes place in cells that are infected by a virus. In\nthis case, the epitopes e1\nI , ... ,em\nI are found by using the\nmethod described in section;\nBuilding the MHCI-peptide sequence:each infected\ncell bears a set of two A and two B alleles.\nThis implies that each protein from the pathogen is processed\nat most four times during the discovery process for class I\nepitopes. After processing the antigen protein, each cell\npresents, on its surface, one randomly chosen epitope with a\nprobability that is proportional to the score of that epitope\ndivided by the sum of scores of all found epitopes. This choice\nreflects the competition for MHC molecules among the\nprotein fragments produced by the proteasome. Inside a single\ninfected cell, antigen peptides are processed so that they bind\none MHC class I molecule. Because we allow cells to display\nonly one MHC peptide molecule per time step on their\nsurface, we have to choose the display protein from within the\nhaplotype (i.e., the four available, two A- and two B- alleles).\nThis is performed by random selection at each time step. The\nprocedure computes the epitope profile ^SS(e\n1\nI ), ... ,^SS(el{8\nI ) as\ndescribed in eq(2), then normalizes it as follows:\nVi~1, ... ,l{8 S(ei\nI )~\n^SS(ei\nI )Pl{8\nj~1 ^SS(ej\nI )\n: ð8Þ\nThe normalized profile is used to select, from the probability\ndistribution S(ei\nI ), the epitope er\nI to be presented on the\nsurface of the cell.\nThis complex is then used to compute the matching score\nagainst the cytotoxic T cell receptor (see section).\n4. The APC shows the MHCIIpep (the complex formed by an\nMHC class II and a nine AA-long peptide) on its surface for\nTH-TCR recognition. This recognition makes use of the score\ndefined in eq(7);\n5. Humoral response\nN Stimulated B cells start cloning and differentiating into long-\nlived memory cells and antibody-producing plasma cells;\nN Plasma cells secrete antibodies;\nN Antibodies bind antigens’ epitopes;\n– to compute the affinity between antibodies and the\nantigen, we follow the same procedure as the one applied\nfor antigen recognition by B cells, (section and section);\n– an immunocomplex is formed by the combination of an\nantibody and an antigen;\n6. Cytotoxic response;\nN For infected cells showing MHCIpep (a complex formed by\nan MHC class I and a 9-mer) on their surface, recognition of\nCTLs via their TRC is performed using the Miyazawa-\nJernigan potential between the MHCIpep and the TCR.\nThe normalized score (eq(7) in section) is used as the\nprobability of binding;\nN Upon successful recognition (i.e., binding), cytotoxic cells kill\nvirus-bearing cells and start cloning.\nThymus education of T lymphocytes\nAs mentioned, we filter randomly created T cell receptors by\nmeans of a procedure that mimics the positive and negative\nselection of immature thymocytes in the thymus gland. This\nreflects the clonal deletion theory proposed by Burnet, according to\nwhich self-reactive lymphoid cells are destroyed during the\ndevelopment of the immune system to prevent autoimmunity.\nIn C-I\nMMSIM, the thymus is modeled as a two-layer filter (see\nFigure 6), and the same procedure for detecting antigen peptides is\nused to differentiate self peptides from proteins that represent the\nself. This process allows T-cells to develop self tolerance (in the\nnegative selection) while eliminating useless cells (positive selec-\ntion). The self is defined by specifying a random set of naturally\noccurring 9-mers extracted from the human proteome. These\npeptides are the same as those that have been used to compute the\nmatrices for the different MHC molecules.\nIn practice, we allow a T cell to enter circulation (i.e., to reach a\nsecondary organ as a mature thymocyte) with a probability given\nby the product of the probability of being positively selected and\nthe probability of being negatively selected,\nPr(TCR is selected)~Pr\nz:Pr{, ð9Þ\nwith\nPrz~1{ P\nnmhc\nj~1\n(1{M(TCR,MHCpep)), ð10Þ\nwhere M(:,:) is the Miyazawa-Jernigan contact potential calcu-\nlated as in eq(7), the only difference being that residues in contact\nwith the MHC and the TCR are taken into account, because there\nis no peptide attached to the MHC at this stage.\nNegative selection is performed according to the following\nprocedure: for each MHCj (j~1, ... ,nmhc) and for each self AA\nstring selfk (k~1, ... ,nself ),\nN compute the sequence profile of the selfk with respect to the\nMHCj, as described in section and section, according to\nwhether the T is a helper or a cytotoxic T cell;\nN randomly choose a peptide and create an MHCpep string;\nN compute the Miyazawa-Jer nigan contact potential\nM(TCR,MHCpep).\nFinally, the probability that a T cell survives negative selection is\nPr{~ P\nj,k\n(1{M(TCR,MHCpep))\n/C20/C21 ThymEff\n, ð11Þ\nwhere the MHC molecule is composed of MHCj and the chosen\npeptide of the selfk. The exponent ThymEff is required because\nwe treat the thymus as if it were composed of ThymEff sub-layers\n(by simulating multiple encounters with each thymic cell receptor).\nParameters of the model\nThe simulator accepts, as input, the definition of the antigen AA\nsequence (in the form of a FASTA file), the matrices defining the\nbinding motifs for the haplotype (four matrices for class I, two\nHLA-A and two HLA-B, as well as two matrices for class II, as\nexplained in section and section), and other variables that are in\npart derived from the literature and in part are free parameters\nused to tune the system. Most of the parameters of this version of\nC-I\nMMSIM are the same with respect to the previous bit-string\nversion. The parameters are described in http://www.iac.cnr.it/\nfilippo/parameter-page.html. The main difference consists in the\nfact that, now, all clonotypic receptors, peptides, and epitopes are\nComputational Bioinformatics\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 April 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 4 | e9862\nFigure 7.
