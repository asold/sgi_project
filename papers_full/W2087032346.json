INTRODUCTION\nP\nOWER transformers are one of the most capital-intensive\nassets in the electrical power network whose reliable op-\neration greatly inﬂuences the safety of the system. During their\nlifetimes, transformers usually exhibit a high level of reliability\nunder normal operating conditions, with an appropriate level of\nmaintenance. However, as a transformer ages, its performance is\nnaturally expected to deteriorate, and the uncertainty regarding\nits performance will increase as it approaches or exceeds the\noriginal designed lifetime, usually 30 to 40 years [1], [2].\nThe ever-aging transformerﬂeets have caused concern within\nmany utilities for whom a large proportion of transformers were\ninstalled in a major load growth period between the 1960s and\n1970s [3], [4]. An extreme strategy to ensure no reduction in\nsystem reliability would be to replace the transformers at a pre-\ndeﬁned age [5]; however, this would consequently incur a large\ncapital investment budget and would be impractical for today’s\nManuscript received October 05, 2012;revised February 08, 2013 and April\n08, 2013; accepted May 16, 2013.

Several utilities, such\nas Hydro One [8] and some U.K. utilities [9], have already\nadopted this procedure in their replacement management. The\nreplacement-management procedure constitutes an indispens-\nable part of asset management, of which the initial stage is to\nestimate the appropriate level ofcapital expenditure (CAPEX).\nThe statistical lifetime model hasbeen speciﬁed as the key\nto the success of replacement requirement projection [10], in\nwhich transformers are treated as nonrepairable units whose\nlifetimes are presumed to be independent random variables, fol-\nlowing a speciﬁc probability distribution. The concept of sta-\ntistical lifetime models as nonrepairable electrical equipment\nwas introduced by Kogan as early as 1986 in his review paper\n[11]. Papers [12]–[15] onthe development and application of\ntransformer lifetime models were published the following years.\nThe development of moreaccurate transformer lifetime models,\nhowever, was landmark e db yL i ’ sp a p e r ,i nw h i c hh ep o i n t e d\nout that the hindrance caused by the limitation on the amount of\nfailure data can be alleviated by the utilization of survival data.\nSeveral transformer lifetime models, including two-parameter\nWeibull distribution [16]–[19], normal distribution [16], log-\nnormal distribution [18], three-parameter Weibull distribution\n[19], generalized exponential distribution [20], modiﬁed Perks’\nmodel [21], piecewise model [22], and competing risk model\n[23], based ondifferent parameter estimation methods were pro-\nposed thereafter.\nNonetheless, whatever lifetime models are being adopted or\nparameter estimation methods that are being utilized, the de-\nrived lifetime model can only be as good as the quality of the\ncollected lifetime data [24]. Yet, the evaluation of data quality\non the accuracy of the derived transformer lifetime model has\nnot been quantitatively discussed.\nThis papertherefore intends to discuss data requisite issues,\nin terms of censoring rate and sample size, for transformer life-\ntime modelling. An extensive review of the complexity of trans-\nformer lifetime data is ﬁrst made, as provided in Section II.\nBased ont h i sa n a l y s i s ,at w o - s t e pM o n t eC a r l os i m u l a t i o ni s\nproposed in Section III to generate sets of required lifetime\ndata in any predeﬁned combination of the censoring rate and\nthe sample size, and the corresponding parameters of lifetime\nmodels for each set of data are estimated accordingly. The sta-\ntistical values of these parameters are calculated and compared\n0885-8977/$31.00 © 2013 IEEE\nZHOU et al.: DATA REQUISITES FOR TRANSFORMER STATISTICAL LIFETIME MODELLING I—PART I 1751\nwith the true values in each speciﬁed censoring rate and sample\nsize; the results are presented inSection IV. The discussions, as\nwell as the practical implications, are presented in Section V.\nFinally, the conclusion is provided.\nII. C\nOMPLEXITY OF TRANSFORMER LIFETIME DATA\nWhat statistical lifetime m odelling generally does is to\nchoose an appropriate statistical distribution function and then\ndetermine the parameters of the distribution function using\nthe initially collected lifetime data, which are assumed to be\ngenerated from an identical distribution.\nA. General Characteristics of Transformer Lifetime Data\nFor most electric utilities, powertransformers are installed in\ndifferent calendar years and operate in different locations. Dif-\nferences exist in the design, mode of operation, and in the nat-\nural and working environment. The natural environment mainly\nrefers to the ambient temperature, lightning activity, climate,\netc., whereas the working environment refers to system inter-\nruption, transient phenomena, and the protection region.\nThese factors might contribute to the scattering of trans-\nformer lifetimes and, hence, violate the homogeneity as-\nsumption that all lifetime data follow an identical distribution\nfunction. In such a case, a mixed population exists. To in-\ncrease the accuracy of the resulting lifetime models, lifetime\ndata should be stratiﬁed/regrouped to obtain statistically ho-\nmogenous populations and, in this process, expert analyses\nare required. An example of data grouping for this purpose\ncan be found in [17] where samples are stratiﬁed into several\ngroups according to manufacturers, representing differences in\ndesign. For discussions on the lifetime modelling with mixed\npopulations, [11] and [25] can be referred to. The stratiﬁcation\nof a mixed population would then result in a reduced sample\nsize for each speciﬁc population.\nWithin a conﬁned duration of observation time, the collected\nlifetime data usually form incomplete datasets since a large pro-\nportion of transformers have not yet completed their life cycle.\nThe ages of failed units (failure data) and the running times of\nsurvival units (censored data) constitute the general two types of\nlifetime data within incomplete datasets that can be used for life-\ntime modelling [26]. It is found that the proportion of survival\nunits in the total population, hereafter referred to as the cen-\nsoring rate, are normally in the high value range, mostly more\nthan 80% [15]–[18], [20], [21].\nIn some utilities, information onearly transformer failures is\nmissing and such a situation naturally restricts the start time of\nthe observation. The data truncation issue [17] arises which will\nfurther complicate the constitution of lifetime data.\nB. Graphical Representation of Lifetime Data\nThe formation of typical lifetime data can be illustrated with\nas i m p l iﬁed ﬁgure, as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe collection of lifetime data for a group of units usually\nended after a prespeciﬁed duration, referred to as censoring\ntime. The two types of lifetime data collected are the failure\ndata and the censored data. As in Fig. 1, failures are units (e.g.,\nunit 1 and unit 2) whose exactlifetimes have been observed\nFig. 1. Graphical representation of the formation of lifetime data.\nwithin the censoring time, while suspensions (e.g., unit 3 and\nunit 4) are the remaining units that have not yet failed but are\nknown to be operating beyond the current running time. The\nfailure data correspond to the exact lifetime of failures, while\nthe censored data correspond to the current running time of\nsuspensions.\nIn real applications, a data truncation problem may exist\nwhere only those units, whose lifetimes lie within the obser-\nvation window, are observed [27]. As shown in Fig. 1, data\ntruncation could result in three types of units which are:\n• a unit, whose failure occurred outside of the observation\nwindow and is observed, for example, in the case of unit 8;\n• a unit, which is observed from the time of truncation (i.e.,\nrather than from the origin of its commission), until it dies\n(e.g., in the case of unit 5 and unit 7);\n• a unit which is observed from the time of truncation until\nit is censored (e.g., in the case of unit 6).\nC. Mathematical Characterization of Lifetime Data\nIn this paper, data simulation is designed to mimic the time-\ncensored sampling scenario inwhich a given amount of trans-\nformer units are commissioned at the same time, and their life-\ntime data are collected at a prespeciﬁed point of time. Note that\ndata truncation is not considered as a means of simpliﬁcation in\nthe present study in order to focus on the censoring effect. For\nfurther discussions on the simulation of the lifetime dataset that\nincludes censoring and truncation, [28] can be referred to, in\nwhich a case study is presented to demonstrate how both types\nof data can be simulated.\nThe following set of notations and assumptions [27] can be\nused to characterize the formulation of typical lifetime data both\nat an individual and population level.\nAssume that each individual unit has a lifetime\n,a n daﬁxed\ncensoring time for a homogenous population of units, the\ns are assumed to be independentand identically distributed\nrandom variables which follow a speciﬁc probability distribu-\ntion. Then, the exact lifetime (failure data) of a speciﬁc unit,\nwill be known if, and only if, is less than or equal to.I n\nthe case that is greater than , the units become suspensions\nwith the lifetime data censored at time.\nThe lifetime data for an individual unit can then be simulated\nthrough the comparison of and provided that these two\n1752 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY , VOL. 28, NO. 3, JULY 2013\nvalues are speciﬁed. The lifetime data can be conveniently rep-\nresented by a pair of variables ,w h e r e\nand indicates whether the lifetime corresponds\nto failure data ,w i t h , or censored data 0)\nwith . This expression will be used in Section III.\nOther terms that help to characterize lifetime data at a pop-\nulation level, are the sample size and the censoring rate, here-\nafter represented as\nand , respectively. Sample size is\ndeﬁned as the total number of samples, including both failures\nand suspensions, while the censoring rate is deﬁned as the\nproportion of censored data and is calculated as the number of\nsuspensions divided by the sample size.\nIn this paper, each combination of the values of\nand\nconstitutes a sampling scenario. To simulate a group of life-\ntime data with a sample size of\nand censoring rate of ,\nnumbers of s are sampled from a prespeciﬁed two-parameter\nWeibull distribution. s are chosen to be a common value which\nis closely related to the expected for all of the units. A\nlifetime dataset can then be generated through the comparison\nof these\nsa n d s.\nIII. DESIGN OF THESIMULATION\nA Monte Carlo simulation is designed to make statistical\nanalyses and evaluations for the derived lifetime models in\neach speciﬁed data generation/sampling scenario.\nA. General Procedure of Monte Carlo Simulation\nThe two-parameter Weibull distribution, whose cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF) is shown in (1), is chosen to sim-\nulate the failure data due to itsﬂexibility in indicating the rate\nof change of the instantaneous failure rate with transformer age\n[29]\n(1)\nwhere\nx failure time, expressed as a variable;\nscale parameter;\nshape parameter.\nThe different ranges of value indicate the different shapes\nof the function of the instantaneous failure rate versus age:\n• 1 represents the “infant mortalities” where the instan-\ntaneous failure rate decreases with age;\n• 1 represents the “random failures” where the instan-\ntaneous failure rate remains constant over the ages;\n• 1 represents the “aging-related failures” where the\ninstantaneous failure rate increases with age.\nThe value of will not inﬂuence the shapes of these relation-\nships. Instead, it indicates the age at which 63.2% of the units\nare expected to fail, irrespective of\n.A n dw h e n ,t h e\nvalue of equals the mean lifetime of the distribution.\nFor each speciﬁed sampling scenario, a set of lifetime data\nis simulated. In order to evaluate the role that the survival data\nhave played in the improvement of lifetime models, two sub-\nsets of lifetime data are collected, with one subset containing\nonly the failure data, and the other subset containing the failure\nand survival data. The maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE)\nis adopted to estimate the corresponding Weibull parameters\n[29]. In this study, the default function “wblﬁt” in the Matlab\nsoftware is directly used which iteratively maximizes the like-\nlihood function using the Newton–Raphson method.\nBy repeating the aforementioned procedure several times,\nstatistical distributions of Weibull parameters for each given\nscenario can be obtained. Comparisons of the estimation results\ncan therefore be made under given criteria.\nA ﬂowchart for the procedure of the Monte Carlo simulation\nis provided in Fig. 2. Explanations for the choices of controlling\nparameters and the overall evaluation criteria are provided in the\nfollowing parts.\nB. Controlling Parameters of Monte Carlo Simulation\nsample size or total number of simulated units;\nnumber of trials for the Monte Carlo\nsimulation;\nscale parameter of the two-parameter Weibull\ndistribution;\nshape parameter of the two-parameter Weibull\ndistribution;\nprobability that a unit starting at time 0 would\nfail before reaching the censoring time\n;t h e\ncensoring time is therefore calculated as\n,w h e r eis the corresponding\nvalue of , which hereafter is\nreferred to as the value;\nexpected censoring rate under a given\ncensoring time\n.\nC. Parameter Levels and Data Generation/Sampling\nIn order to cover a wider range of sampling scenarios that\nresearchers might encounter in practical applications, multiple\nlevels of the controlling parameters as listed in Table I are\nchosen.\nThe\nvalue is chosen to be a single value as 50, because\nchanging the value does not affect the shape of the function of\nthe instantaneous failure rate versus age. Thevalue is chosen\nas 5 to represent the ageing-related failures which are mostly of\nconcern by the utilities.\nThe expected value of\n, unlike the other controlling pa-\nrameters, is dependent on the choice of ,a sar e l a -\ntionship between sa n d exists. For a lifetime\ndataset collected at aﬁxed censoring time of the popula-\ntion represents the proportion of samples that survived up to the\ntime\n,a n d represents the proportion of failures that\naccumulated up to the same time. plus would\nthen be equal to the value of 1 or thereabouts. That is to say, to\nZHOU et al.: DATA REQUISITES FOR TRANSFORMER STATISTICAL LIFETIME MODELLING I—PART I 1753\nFig. 2. Flowchart of the Monte–Carlo simulation.\nobtain an expected of, say 95%, the censoring timeshould\nbe chosen as the value which makes 0.05.\nTABLE I\nCHOSEN LEVELS OF CONTROLLING PARAMETERS\nTo obtain sample sets with an exact censoring rate, the life-\ntime datasets are therefore sampled conditionally on the desired\ncensoring rate (i.e., )u n d e rt h eﬁxed censoring time\n. The number of Monte Carlo repetitions to sample lifetime\ndatasets in this manner is chosen to be 10 000.\nAll combinations of the independent controlling parameters\nas listed in theﬁrst ﬁve rows of Table I result in 1312 sam-\npling scenarios. Simulations are then conducted in each of these\nsampling scenarios.\nD. Evaluation Criteria for the Simulation Results\nFor an effective evaluation of all estimation results, the as-\npects of trueness and precision should be considered. As deﬁned\nin [30], the measure of trueness is usually expressed in terms of\nbias, while the measure of precision is usually computed as the\nstandard deviation of the test results.\nMean square error (MSE) [31] is a commonly used metric for\nan overall evaluation of bias andstandard deviation (SD). It is\ndeﬁned as\nBias (2)\nwhere\nBias\ntrue value of the concerned parameter;\nestimated result of the concerned parameter.\nFor a consistent comparison of the estimated results, the\nrelative root mean square error (RRMSE), based on MSE, is\nadopted as one of the evaluation criteria in this paper. It is\ndeﬁned as\nBias (3)\nIt is therefore expected that the lower the RRMSE value, the\nbetter the results obtained in a given sampling scenario become.\nHowever, RRMSE shares the same disadvantage as the mean\nvalue, in that it is affected by any single extreme value which\nis either too high or too low compared to the rest of the results.\nFor this type of distribution, the median value can provide ad-\nditional information on the central tendency of the results. The\n1754 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY , VOL. 28, NO. 3, JULY 2013\nFig. 3. s of estimated in various sampling scenarios.\nmedian value is suitable for the midpoint evaluation of skewed\ndistributions. For a symmetrical distribution, the median value\nis the same as the mean value.\nThe relative difference between the median value and the true\nvalue , hereafter referred to as\n,i sa d o p t e da st h ec r i t e r i o n\nto measure the central tendency of the results. It is deﬁned as\nMedian (4)\nwhere\ntrue value of the concerned parameter;\nestimated result of the concerned parameter;\nMedian median value of the estimated parameters.\nIt is therefore expected that the closer the is to zero, the\ngreater the accuracy of estimation results.\nIn summary, RRMSE provides an overall evaluation for the\naccuracy level of estimation results, while provides addi-\ntional information on the centraltendency of the estimated re-\nsults to the true values. Both parameters complement each other\nfor an effective evaluation and, therefore, are chosen as evalu-\nation criteria for the series of Monte Carlo simulation results\nobtained in each sampling scenario.\nIV . S\nIMULATION RESULTS ANDGENERAL TREND ANALYSIS\nAfter a series of Monte Carlo simulations, statistical results\nfor each Weibull parameter are obtained. Comparisons of these\nresults among different sampling scenarios are presented and\ndiscussed to evaluate the effects that the survival data have on\nlifetime models as well as the inﬂuences that the sample size\nand censoring rate have on the accuracy of the results.\nA. Comparisons Based on the RD\nThe\ns of the estimated values and values in each of\nthe combinations of the censoring rate and the sample size are\npresented in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. The black lines indicate\nthe estimated results based on lifetime data of failures only and\nthe gray lines indicate the estimated results based on lifetime\ndata of failures as well as suspensions; the same format is main-\ntained in the followingﬁgures.\nFig. 4. s of estimated in various sampling scenarios.\nFig. 5. RRMSEs of estimated in various sampling scenarios.\nIt is revealed in Figs. 3 and 4 that thevalues tend to be un-\nderestimated while the values tend to be overestimated when\nonly the failures are utilized for parameter estimation. With the\nhelp of suspensions, the median values move closer to the true\nvalue; hence, more accurate results are obtained. The closeness,\nhowever, is conﬁned by the censoring rate and the sample size.\nThe\nvalues still tend to be underestimated, and thevalues\ntend to be overestimated in sampling scenarios of high cen-\nsoring rate and low sample size.\nThe bias of central tendency in the high censoring rate and the\nlow sample size region can be reduced by either increasing the\nsample size or decreasing the censoring rate or both, as revealed\nin Figs. 3 and 4.\nB. Comparisons Based on the RRMSE\nThe RRMSEs of estimated\nvalues in each of the combina-\nt i o n so ft h es a m p l es i z ea n dt h ec e n s o r i n gr a t ea r ep r e s e n t e di n\nFig. 5.\nIt is observed in Fig. 5 that RRMSEs of\nobtained with fail-\nures plus suspensions are generally lower than the results ob-\ntained with failure data only,indicating a higher degree of ac-\ncuracy. However, an exceptionoccurs in the sampling scenario\nwhere the censoring rate is 95% and the sample size is 40. This\nis mainly due to the existence of a limited number of extremely\nhigh values of the estimated\n. Due to the existence of the lim-\nited number of extremely high values, the standard deviation\nZHOU et al.: DATA REQUISITES FOR TRANSFORMER STATISTICAL LIFETIME MODELLING I—PART I 1755\nFig. 6. Probability density of estimated values where 95% and\n40.\nFig. 7. Cumulative distribution of estimated values where 95% and\n40.\nwill be very high. The standard deviation as an indispensable\npart of the RRMSE, as shown in (3), will then contribute to an\nexceptionally high value of the RRMSE.\nThe existence of extremely high values can be conﬁrmed with\nthe probability density plots of estimated\nvalues in this sce-\nnario, as presented in Fig. 6. Its corresponding cumulative dis-\ntribution is provided in Fig. 7 as well.\nFig. 6 shows that there is a limited number of extremely large\nvalues (e.g., approaching 1000), based on failures and suspen-\nsions. A large proportion of the results (e.g., 80%), as shown in\nthe gray line of Fig. 7, is within the range of 25 to 70, with\nthe true\nvalue of 50 being covered. However, the estimated\nvalues based on failures are only within the range of 30, as\nshown in Figs. 6 and 7, with the true value of 50 being out of\nreach. This again proves that suspensions play a positive role in\nimproving the accuracy of the estimated\nvalues.\nThe relationship between the changes of the RRMSEs of\nand the changes of the censoring rate and the sample size can\nalso be observed in Fig. 5. For the estimated results based on\nfailures as well as suspensions, the RRMSE decreases with ei-\nther a decrease in the censoring rate or with an increase in the\nsample size or both. However, in the case of estimated results\nbased on failures only, the RRMSE decreases only with a de-\ncrease in the censoring rate.\nThe RRMSEs of\nin the region of the censoring rate ranges\nfrom 0% to 90% and the sample size ranging from 60 to 1000\nFig. 8. RRMSEs of estimated with censoring rate ranges from 0% to 90%\nand sample size ranges from 60 to 1000.\nare presented as shown in Fig. 8, from which the overall trend\nof the changes of RRMSEs with the changes of the censoring\nrate and the sample size can be observed. The reason for not\nshowing all of the simulation scenarios in Fig. 8 is that an ex-\nceptionally high RRMSE occurs inthe sampling scenario where\nthe censoring rate is 95%, and the sample size is 40; if the results\nare to be presented together with those obtained in other sam-\npling scenarios, then a clear observation of the RRMSE versus\nsample size and censoring rate relationships cannot be made.\nFig. 8 shows that the estimated\nv a l u e sb a s e do nf a i l u r e sa s\nwell as suspensions are generally more accurate compared with\nthe estimated results based on failures only. In both cases of es-\ntimated results (i.e., those based on failures only and those based\non failures as well as suspensions), the RRMSEs of\ndecrease\nwith either a decrease in the censoring rate or an increase in the\nsample size or both.\nThe results presented before suggest that suspensions play a\npositive role in improving the accuracy of the transformer life-\ntime model and, therefore, shouldbe used in lifetime modelling.\nLifetime data sharing between utilities, whose transformer units\nare designed, operated, and maintained in a similar fashion,\nshould be promoted. This is because the sample size can be in-\ncreased in this manner, and the accuracy of the transformer life-\ntime model is therefore improved. The model can also be im-\nproved when more failure data within a speciﬁc population are\ncollected as the censoring rate is decreased.\nV. D\nISCUSSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS\nAs concluded in Section IV, increasing the sample size\nor decreasing the censoring rate are speciﬁed as the two ap-\nproaches to improve the estimation accuracy of transformer\nlifetime models. In practical applications, however, researchers\nare more concerned with the requirement in terms of minimum\nsample size or maximum censoring rate of the collected lifetime\ndata under a desired accuracy level. Discussions are therefore\nmade on the requirement of the minimum sample size for\nlifetime data with the censoring rate located in ranges that were\nmostly encountered in real applications.\nFor this purpose, a brief summary of theﬁeld transformer\nlifetime data, in terms of the sample size and censoring rate,\n1756 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY , VOL. 28, NO. 3, JULY 2013\nTABLE II\nSUMMARY ON THEGENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TRANSFORMER LIFETIME\nDATA\nTABLE III\nRRMSESO F WITHIN SELECTED RANGES OF THECENSORING RATE\nis ﬁrst provided in Table II. These data are summarized from\nliterature on lifetime modelling [15]–[18], [20].\nAs shown in Table II, the transformer lifetime data are in the\nhigh censoring rate region of more than 75%. To simplify the\nanalysis, four categories ofcensoring rate at 80%, 85%, 90%,\nand 95% are selected as the ranges mostly encountered in prac-\ntical applications.\nAssuming that all lifetime d ata are collected from the\ntwo-parameter Weibull distribution and the maximum-likeli-\nhood method is utilized in the lifetime modelling, the Monte\nCarlo simulation results (i.e., the RRMSEs of the estimated\nand values) can then be quoted for analysis and discussion\nhere since the value of RRMSE can be directly taken as a\nmeasure of accuracy level. The RRMSEs of the estimated\nvalues, in the four selected ranges of the censoring rate, are\nlisted in Table III.\nTo determine the exact requirement of the sample size in each\ncategory of the censoring rate, adesired accuracy level should\nbe speciﬁed. Assuming that all of the estimated results in each\nsampling scenario constitute an unbiased normal distribution\n(which means that the bias equals zero) and there is a standard\ndeviation of less than 1/4 of the mean value as an appropriate\nconﬁnement for the precision of the distribution, this then re-\nsults in a desired RRMSE of less than 0.25, according to (3).\nChoosing RRMSE\n0.25 as the expected accuracy of the\nestimated values, the corresponding minimum sample size\nat each selected censoring rate is then obtained by either di-\nrectly looking up data or interpolating data as listed in Table III.\nTABLE IV\nREQUIREMENT OF THEMINIMUM SAMPLE SIZE AND NUMBER OF FAILURES AT\nTHE SELECTED CENSORING RATE UNDER THE EXPECTED ACCURACY LEVEL\nThe results are provided in Table IV, where their corresponding\nnumber of failures are calculated and listed together with their\ncorresponding RRMSE of\n.\nIt is shown that the estimated values exhibit higher accu-\nracy levels compared with the estimated values in the same\nsampling scenario. The lower accuracy level of estimatedis\ntherefore taken as the measure to assess the accuracy of esti-\nmated Weibull distributions.\nIt is also found that although the required minimum sample\nsizes are different throughout the different categories of the cen-\nsoring rate, the required minimum number of failures that re-\nsult is almost the same among different categories of the cen-\nsoring rate. The required minimum number of failures, as listed\nin Table IV, is found to be around 20. This value, somehow,\ncan correspond to the limit value which differentiates small and\nmoderate sample sizes as suggested in [29]. Besides, 20 is also\nthe value suggested by Liu (i.e., that below which the Weibull\ndistribution cannot accurately differentiate from a lognormal\ndistribution [32]). These correlations suggest that a minimum\nfailure number of 20 may serve asan appropriate criterion for\nevaluating whether a set of lifetime data qualiﬁes for Weibull\nlifetime modelling at a given accuracy level.\nVI. C\nONCLUSION\nThe effect that the survival data has on lifetime models is\nanalyzed through a series of Monte Carlo simulations. Based\non the simulation results, it is proved that the accuracy of the\nlifetime models can be improved by taking the survival data into\naccount.\nT h ed e g r e eo fi m p r o v e m e n t, however, is greatly conﬁned by\nthe censoring rate and the sample size of the collected lifetime\ndata. For a two-parameter Weibull distribution, whose param-\neters are estimated using the maximum-likelihood method, the\nscale parameter tends to be underestimated whereas the shape\nparameter tends to be overestimated when the sample size of the\nlifetime data is low and its censoring rate is high.\nIncreasing the sample size and/or decreasing the censoring\nrate are identiﬁed as effective measures to improve the accu-\nracy of the lifetime model. To improve the accuracy of the life-\ntime model, lifetime data sharing between utilities that operate\nsimilar transformer units should be encouraged as the only way\nto increase the sample size. Equally, the lifetime model should\nalso be updated whenever new failure data are observed since\nthe censoring rate can be reduced; a minimum failure number\nof 20 is recommended to serve as the qualifying criterion for\nWeibull lifetime modelling.\nZHOU et al.: DATA REQUISITES FOR TRANSFORMER STATISTICAL LIFETIME MODELLING I—PART I 1757\nREFERENCES\n[1] IEEE Guide for the Evaluation and Reconditioning of Liquid Immersed\nPower Transformers, IEEE Standard C57.140-2006, Apr. 2007.\n[2] CIGRE Working Group A2.34, Guide for Transformer Maintenance\nC I G R EP u b l . ,T e c h .B r o c h u r eN o .4 4 5 ,F e b .2 0 1 1 .\n[3] M.
