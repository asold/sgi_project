    "abstract": "The main objective of the current work was to enhance the transformer fault diagnostic accuracy based on dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data with a proposed coupled system of support vector machine (SVM)-bat algorithm (BA) and Gaussian classifiers. Six electrical and thermal fault classes were categorized based on the IEC and IEEE standard rules. The concentration of five main combustible gases (hydrogen, methane, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene) was utilized as an input vector of the two classifiers. Two types of input vectors have been tested; the first input type considered the five gases in ppm, and the second input type considered the gases introduced in the percentage of the sum of the five gases. An extensive database of 481 had been used for training and testing phases (321 data samples for training and 160 data samples for testing). The SVM model conditioning parameter “λ” and penalty margin parameter “C” were adjusted through the bat algorithm to develop a maximum accuracy rate. The SVM-BA and Gaussian classifiers’ accuracy was evaluated and compared with several DGA techniques in the literature.",
