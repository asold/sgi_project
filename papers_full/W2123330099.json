  "abstract": "Abstract A Solid Freeform Fabrication Process called Three Dimensional Printing is applied to the fabrication of injection molding tooling with cooling channels which are conformal to the molding cavity. The tool is created by spreading layers of stainless steel powder and selectviely joining the powder in the layers by ink‐jet printing of a binder material. Unbound powder is removed from without and within the green part thus defined. The green part is sintered and infiltrated with a copper alloy to produce a fully dense tool. The infiltrant is kept out of the cooling channels by elevating the tool above the free surface of the pool of infiltrant in the crucible, thus creating a controlled negative pressure within the infiltrant. An upper limit to the separation of tooling cavity and cooling channel was derived based on transient heat transfer considerations. A tooling set was created to mold a split ring shape and conformal cooling channels were placed in both the cavity and core sides of the tool. The performance of this tool was compared against the performance of a tooling set with straight cooling channels. Thermocouples buried in the core and cavity showed that the conformal tool had no period of transient behavior at the start of molding, while the tool with straight channels took 10–15 cycles to come to an equilibrium temperature some 40°C above the temperature of the coolant. The conformal tool was also found to maintain a more uniform temperature within the tool during an individual molding cycle. The gap in the molded split rings did not change from cycle to cycle with the conformal tool, while it did with the conventional tool. A 2‐D finite difference model accurately captured the observed temperature histories of the mold with conformal cooling channels.",
