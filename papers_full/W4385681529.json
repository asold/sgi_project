  "abstract": "Writing a readme is a crucial aspect of software development as it plays a\\nvital role in managing and reusing program code. Though it is a pain point for\\nmany developers, automatically creating one remains a challenge even with the\\nrecent advancements in large language models (LLMs), because it requires\\ngenerating an abstract description from thousands of lines of code. In this\\ndemo paper, we show that LLMs are capable of generating a coherent and\\nfactually correct readmes if we can identify a code fragment that is\\nrepresentative of the repository. Building upon this finding, we developed\\nLARCH (LLM-based Automatic Readme Creation with Heuristics) which leverages\\nrepresentative code identification with heuristics and weak supervision.\\nThrough human and automated evaluations, we illustrate that LARCH can generate\\ncoherent and factually correct readmes in the majority of cases, outperforming\\na baseline that does not rely on representative code identification. We have\\nmade LARCH open-source and provided a cross-platform Visual Studio Code\\ninterface and command-line interface, accessible at\\nhttps://github.com/hitachi-nlp/larch. A demo video showcasing LARCH's\\ncapabilities is available at https://youtu.be/ZUKkh5ED-O4.\\n",
