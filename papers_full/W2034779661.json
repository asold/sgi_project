    "abstract": "This paper addresses the evaluation of the high frequency effects for coreless transformers using PCB coils. First, analytical equations allow to compute the current density distribution over the cross-section of PCB conductors. The theoretical values of resistance and internal self inductance can then be estimated with energy considerations. Examples of computed results are shown in order to verify the accuracy of the model. Finally, measurements are realized on PCB coils and the results are compared to those of the analytical model.",
