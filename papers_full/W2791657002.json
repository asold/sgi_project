Today, fossil fuel resources are the major\nenergy sources used for generating electricity. These\nresources include petroleum, natural gas, coal, etc. [ 1],\nwhich also result in serious environmental pollution and\ncontribute to global warming by releasing the harmful\ncarbon dioxide into the atmosphere. In addition, such\nresources are non-renewable limited energy sources that\ncannot fulﬁll the ever increasing demand for energy.\nRenewable sources of energy such as biomass, wave\nenergy, wind power, hydroelectricity, and solar power\ncould be alternative sources to replace fossil energy\nresources. Renewable resources provided for about 18% of\nglobal energy consumption in 2006 [ 2]. Wind power is\ncurrently widely used in the United States and Europe. It is\ninstalled capacity of over 100 GW and growing rate of\nover the 30% per annum. Photovoltaic industry could\nproduce more than 2000 MW of electricity power in 2006\n[2]. Because of their reliability and easy access to the\nenergy source, photovoltaic systems have attracted much\nmore attention than other technologies that use renewable\nenergy sources. Advantages of photovoltaic (PV) systems\noutweigh their drawbacks. Some of these advantages are\nlong life, low maintenance needs, ease of installation and\nno need for fuel; drawbacks are low output in cloudy days\nand high costs of initial setup [ 3]. The voltage generated by\na PV cell is low (about 0.5 to 0.7 V); thus, it is necessary to\nconnect a series of cells in a PV panel. In addition, the\npanels can be linked in parallel or in series to produce\nhigher voltage with a greater current with same voltage, or\nthe same current, respectively [ 4]. Generally, grid con-\nnected PV inverters can be divided into two groups: single\nCrossCheck date: 23 October 2017\nReceived: 29 November 2016 / Accepted: 24 October 2017 /\nPublished online: 29 January 2018\n/C211The Author(s) 2018.

Previous studies\nwere mainly centered on single stage inverters, while\npresent and future studies mainly focus on two stage\ninverters. In two stage inverters, a DC/DC converter con-\nnects the PV panel and the DC/AC inverter. The PV panel\nconverts sunlight to DC electricity (for a PV panel with low\noutput voltage, a DC/DC boost converter is used [ 5]); DC\nvoltage can then be converted to AC voltage with a power\nelectronics system (inverter).\nIn either grid-connected or stand-alone applications of\nsuch devices, DC voltage can be converted to AC voltage\nby a DC/AC inverter system [ 4]. Grid-connected or stand-\nalone, these devices are used in a wide range of systems\ntoday, from streetlights to space vehicles. They are used as\nan attempt to improve reliability, efﬁciency and cost [ 6].\nIn the past, galvanic isolation in photovoltaic grid-con-\nnected inverters was mainly realized through employing\nline frequency transformers between the photovoltaic sys-\ntem and the grid. These transformers were not only difﬁcult\nto install, but also large and heavy. In addition, they\nincreased system complexity and were inefﬁcient due to\nseveral power stages [ 7, 8]. To solve the problems of\nefﬁciency, cost and size of inverters, transformer-less\ninverters were introduced. Removing the transformer cau-\nses a galvanic connection between the photovoltaic system\nand the power grid. Thus, the common mode leakage\ncurrent may follow through the parasitic capacitors\nbetween photovoltaic system and ground [ 9]. This leakage\ncurrent increases system losses and grid current harmonics\nand leads to serious unsafety [ 10]. Therefore, the common\nmode leakage current must be taken into account in\ndesigning transformer-less PV inverters.\nThe efﬁciency of a PV system is directly affected by the\nintensity of sun radiation and ambient temperature. In\npower applications, the efﬁciency of a PV systems needs be\nhigh if it is to deliver the power to the grid. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to track the maximum power under changing\nsurrounding conditions. In a two-stage inverter, the ﬁrst\nstage – DC/DC boost converter –delivers maximum power\nto the second stage and regulates the DC-link voltage\n[11, 12]. There are various types of controllers, e.g., P&O,\nFuzzy, Neural network, sliding mode controller etc., to\ntrack the maximum power in the ﬁrst stage [ 13]. In the\nsecond stage, the controller system controls power stability\nand quality. In PV applications, good inverter controllers\nare essential for enhancing the inverter performance since\nthe conversion process depends on control algorithms [ 14].\nThis paper reviews the literature on the design of grid-\nconnected PV systems containing DC/DC boost converters,\nDC/AC inverters, and controllers used for converters and\ninverters.\n2 Photovoltaic device\nSeveral energy sources are available for energy con-\nversion systems, including batteries, PV devices, fuel cells\nand wind generators. Each energy source is connected to its\ninverter through a speciﬁc integration technique; some-\ntimes, additional devices and extra steps may also be\nneeded. For instance, a wind turbine generator needs an\nextra AC/DC converter (e.g. rectiﬁer) to connect to an\ninverter [ 15], since it generates an AC instead of a DC\ncurrent. On the contrary, a PV panel creates DC power;\nthus, it can be linked to the inverter directly or through a\nDC/DC converter. Favorably, this will decrease the total\ncost [ 16]. Essentially, a PV cell has a semiconductor P-N\njunction diode cell that directly transforms light into\nelectricity [ 17]. When sunlight hits common junctions of a\np-n diode, comprising of photons, the electron system of\nthe material absorbs the energy and produces electron-hole\npairs (charge carriers). These are detached by the potential\nwall, generating a voltage that uses an external circuit to\ndrive a current through, known as the photovoltaic effect\n[18]. Different cell arrangements, such as series-parallel,\nparallel and series create a PV module that has a speciﬁc\npower capacity [ 19].\nLikewise, modules are linked in series-parallel\narrangement to gain higher power capacity and make a\npanel or array [ 20]. The solar cell’s output voltage is a\nfunction of the photocurrent that is contingent on the level\nof solar irradiation throughout the process [ 21].\nShortcomings of a PV device include low energy con-\nversion efﬁciency and high cost of initial-installation\n[22–26]. The control system has an important role in a PV\nsystem that uses power converters, such as DC/DC con-\nverters and DC/AC inverters to safeguard the system’s\noverall operation [ 27].\n3 DC/DC power converter\nDC/DC power converters are employed in PV systems\nto change the output voltage. Normally, a DC/DC con-\nverter is sequentially inserted between the load and the PV\npanel to gain the power available from the panel through\ntracking methods. It is useful for a PV system with\nunstable and ﬂuctuating output. If the PV system uses both\nAC and DC converters, a DC-link capacitor can enhance\nthe DC output voltage stability, and therefore, reduce the\neffect of ﬂuctuation on the AC output [ 28]. DC converters\nmay be boost converters (step-up), buck converters (step-\ndown), or a combination of both, like CUK converters and\nbuck-boost converters. Converter type may be selected\nbased on the desired capacity or size of the output voltage\nOverview of grid-connected two-stage transformer-less inverter design 643\n123\nto provide the appropriate input voltage for the inverter\nwith the dc voltage stabilization and regulation capability\n[29]. This is applicable for hybrid energy systems, grid-\nconnected systems and standalone systems. DC/DC con-\nverter in such systems works with a maximum power\noperating algorithm so that the PV system generates more\npower. The performance of a converter varies based on the\nspeciﬁc application.\n4 DC/AC inverter\nAn inverter is a power electronic converter, which\nconverts DC power to AC power [ 30] to generate a sinu-\nsoidal AC output with controllable frequency and magni-\ntude [ 31]. Inverters are classiﬁed into two types: a voltage\nsource inverter (VSI) is an inverter which is fed with\nconstant voltage, while a current source inverter (CSI) is\nfed with constant current. Generally, CSIs are used for\napplications that need very high power AC motor drives.\nAccording to the aims, a single-phase VSI was used in this\nstudy.\nThe single-phase inverter involves power stage of two\nlegs, a DC-link capacitor, and a DC input voltage source\n(VDC). The DC input voltage source is basically a constant\nvoltage source that can be connected to the DC-link\ncapacitor. DC input voltage level is determined by the\ninverter’s speciﬁcations. For a power system, the dc input\nvoltage level of a single-phase inverter should be greater\nthan the peak voltage of the inverter’s line-to-line AC\noutput voltage. The capacitor’s properties are important\nwhen there is a ﬂuctuating input DC power, as is the case\nfor a PV panel, to ensure that the DC-link voltage is kept\nstable during switching between power devices [ 32]. The\nDC-link capacitance must be sufﬁcient enough to decrease\nthe DC-link voltage ripple, in order to generate quality\noutput power [ 33].\nSwitching devices is an important part of DC/AC con-\nversion. Each leg has two insulated gate bipolar transistors\n(IGBTs) with anti-parallel diodes so that the legs never\nwork simultaneously [ 30]. Switching device is selected\nbased on the speciﬁc design of a system, e.g. switching\nspeed and power capacity. Generally, MOSFET is chosen\nfor supplying lower power capacity with fast switching\nspeed, whereas IGBT is used for higher power capacity\nwith medium switching speed [ 31].\n5 Design of grid-tied PV inverter\nThe inverter in the grid-tied PV system acts as an\ninterface between energy sources: the utility grid on one\nside and the PV module on the other. As the inverter\ntransforms DC power into AC power, it is in control of\npower quality that should be met as required by different\nstandards. Based on the galvanic isolation between the grid\nand the PV module, the grid-tied PV inverters are grouped\ninto isolated and non-isolated types. A high frequency\ntransformer or a line frequency transformer can be used to\nobserve the galvanic isolation that adjusts DC voltage of\nthe converter [ 34–36]. Usually, this galvanic isolation is\nrealized through a transformer that has a great effect on\nDC/AC efﬁciency of grid-connected PV systems [ 37]. In a\ngrid connected PV system, the existence of galvanic iso-\nlation depends on the regulations of each country [ 38]. In\ncountries, such as Italy and UK, it is a requirement and is\nimplemented either by a high-frequency transformer on the\nDC side or by a low-frequency step-up transformer on the\ngrid side, as shown in Fig. 1b, c.\nDue to weight, size and cost problems, line frequency\ntransformers are usually preferred to be removed when\ndesigning a new converter. Moreover, a high-frequency\ntransformer requires numerous power stages, which makes\nit difﬁcult to increase efﬁciency and reduce the costs\n[39].\nOn the other hand, in Spain and Germany galvanic\nisolation is not used if other technological solutions are\nemployed to separate the electrical grid and the PV array.\nFigure 1a depicts a typical transformer-less PV system,\nwhich decreases installation complexity, weight cost and\nsize of the whole system. One drawback of these systems is\nthat DC currents may be produced in the injected AC\ncurrent by the inverter because of the missing line-fre-\nquency transformer, causing overheating and failure\n[40, 41]. One of the advantages of these systems is 2%\nincrease in the total efﬁciency [ 30, 42, 43].\nCpPV\nDC\nDC\nDC\nAC\nFilter\nLow\nfrequency\ntransformer\n~Grid\nA low frequency transformer\nCpPV\nDC\nDC\nDC\nAC\nFilter\nHigh\nfrequency\ntransformer\n~Grid\nA high frequency transformer\nCpPV\nDC\nDC\nDC\nAC\nFilter ~Grid\nA transformer-less inverter\n(c)\n(b)\n(a)\nFig. 1 Grid-connected PV system\n644 Mohsen SHAYESTEGAN\n123\n6 Leakage ground current\nThere is no galvanic isolation between the grid and PV\narray in a transformer-less topology. As such, the grid and\nthe PV panels are directly linked, so the leakage ground\ncurrents, created through the potential ﬂuctuations between\nthe grid and the PV array, have a direct path [ 44]. The\nparasitic capacitance created between the grounded frame\nand surface of the PV are charged and discharged by these\nvoltage ﬂuctuations, shown as CG-PV in Fig. 2.\nA resonant circuit is formed by the parasitic capacitance\nand the DC lines that link the inverter to the PV array.\nResonance frequency in this circuit depends on the length\nof DC cables and PV array size [ 45, 46]. According to the\ninverter topology, modulation strategy and PV panel\nstructure, a ground current can ﬂow in the body if panel\nsurfaces are touched; if the current is higher than a certain\nlevel, it can result in a shock or lead to injury [ 69]. The\nblue intermittent line in Fig. 2 shows the path of the ground\ncurrent moving through the parasitic capacitance of the PV\narray.\nBased on the VDE0126-1-1 standard, a residual current\nmonitoring unit should be used to monitor secure operation\nof a grid-connected PV system.

It has 4 transistors, linked as shown\nin Fig. 3a.\nSince many commercial inverters employ this topology\ntogether with a low frequency transformer, it is worth\nstudying its use for transformer-less inverters. Unipolar\nPWM is the most commonly used modulation in this\ntopology, since it offers several advantages compared to\nbipolar modulation, such as better efﬁciency or lower\nemission of electromagnetic interferences and lower cur-\nrent ripple at high frequencies [ 48]. Nevertheless, a high\nfrequency common mode voltage of amplitude V\ndc/2 is\napplied to the photovoltaic panels in unipolar PWM mod-\nulation, which produces a non-negligible leakage current\nPV\nDC\nAC\nFilter ~Grid\nIG-PV IG-PV\nIG-PV\nCG-PV\nFig. 2 Path of ground leakage current in transformer-less PV system\nSW3\n~VgCo\nL2\nL1\n(a) Full H-bridge topology\nB\nSW1\nSW4SW2\nCpPV\nCPV\nCPV\n~VgCo\nL\nB\nSW1\nSW2\nCp1\nPV\nCPV\nCPV Cp2\nA\n(b) Half H-bridge topology\nSW3\n~Co\nL2\nL1\n(c) H5 topology\nB\nSW1\nSW4SW2\nCpPV\nCPV\nCPV\nSW5\nSW3\nCo\nL2\nL1\n(d) H6 topology\nB\nSW1\nSW4SW2\nPV\nCPV\nCPV\nSW5\nCp1\nCp2\nA\nA Vg\nSW2\n~Co\nL\n(e) NPC half-bridge inverter\nB\nSW3\nPV\nCPV\nCPV\nCp1\nCp2\nVgD1\nD2\nD1\nD2\nSW1\nSW4\n~Vg A\nA\nFig. 3 Topology of inverters\nOverview of grid-connected two-stage transformer-less inverter design 645\n123\ndue to the parasitic capacitance of photovoltaic panels.\nThus, it is not recommended to use this modulation in\ntransformer-less inverters [ 49]. In the full H-bridge pho-\ntovoltaic inverter, the Bipolar PWM modulation is used to\nsolve the problem of the leakage current. This eliminates\nhigh frequency components of the applied common-mode\nvoltage to the panels [ 50]. The common mode voltage has\nonly the low frequency component of the ﬁrst harmonic\nand thus, leakage current is reduced [ 9, 46, 51]. However,\ngate signals of bridge transistors need to be synchronized\nso that peak leakage current is limited. Otherwise, leakage\ncurrent might increase signiﬁcantly [ 52]. Therefore, this\ntopology is not suitable for transformer-less photovoltaic\ninverters, even when bipolar PWM modulation is used\n[53].\n7.2 Half H-bridge\nThe half H-bridge topology involves a capacitive divider\ncoupled with the photovoltaic module and 2 transistors\nshown in Fig. 3b.\nThe grid neutral wire connection to the capacitive\ndivider midpoint warrants a more or less constant voltage\nthat inhibits leakage current through the module’s parasitic\ncapacitance [ 54]. The half H-bridge uses half of the\nsemiconductors, which makes it simpler and less costly\nthan the H-bridge topology [ 55]. However, serious disad-\nvantages limit its use. For example, the switches need to\nsupport twice the voltage required in full H-bridge topol-\nogy, the output waveform has only two levels, and the\noutput current is so distorted that produces high electro-\nmagnetic interference emissions [ 54, 56]. Therefore, it\nneeds higher blocking voltage power transistors that in turn\nincrease the switching losses.\n7.3 H5 topology\nH5 topology was ﬁrst introduced by the SMA [ 57].\nCompared to the full-bridge, this topology requires only\none extra transistor. This means that, the photovoltaic\npanels are disconnected from the grid during current free-\nwheeling periods to inhibit switching of frequency ripple in\npanel poles’ the voltage to ground, keeping a nearly con-\nstant common mode voltage. The H5 topology shown in\nFig. 3c uses a full-bridge consisting of a DC-bypass SW\n5\nswitch and 4 other switches: SW 1,S W 2,S W 3 and SW 4.\nSW1 and SW 2 switches work at grid frequency, while\nSW3,S W 4 and SW 5 function at high frequency. SW 5 is\nopen during current free-wheeling period, detaching the\ninverter of full H-bridge from photovoltaic panels. SW 1\ncloses the free-wheeling path, by SW 3 and SW 1 inverse\ndiode for the negative half-cycle and the SW 3 inverse diode\nfor the positive half-cycle of electrical grid. H5\ntransformer-less inverter topology is highly efﬁcient,\nespecially at partial load [ 58]. It only requires one extra\ntransistor compared to the full H-bridge topology. Never-\ntheless, conduction losses may increase in case of a low-\nquality semiconductor, since the transistor is in series with\nthe full H-bridge inverter [ 59]. Currently, this topology is\nused by some inverters in the market, particularly those\nfrom branded patent, as an alternative to transformer-less\nphotovoltaic inverters [ 50].\n7.4 H6 topology\nFull-bridge with DC bypass (FB-DCBP) topology adds a\nbidirectional clamping branch and two switches to the FB\ntopology shown in Fig. 3d[ 60]. The clamping branch has\ntwo diodes and a capacitive divider that clamp half of the\nDC input voltage to the CM voltage. SW\n1 and SW 4 are\ncommutated in anti-parallel to SW 2 and SW 3 with line\nfrequency, depending on whether the grid voltage is in\nnegative or positive half period. D 1 or D 2 (diodes of SW 1\nand SW 2) work during freewheeling mode depending on\nwhether freewheeling path potential is lower or higher than\nhalf of the DC link voltage. Effectiveness of leakage cur-\nrent removal in this topology depends only on the turn-on\nspeed of the clamping diodes. The main disadvantage of\nFB-DCBP topology is conduction losses due to the ﬂow of\ninductor current through four switches in the active mode\n[60].\n7.5 NPC half-bridge\nThe NPC half-bridge is a single-phase version of the\nmultilevel topology for high-power motor-drive uses [ 61].\nIt has been lately introduced as an alternative in designing\nphotovoltaic inverters. It has a branch with two clamping\ndiodes and 4 transistors shown in Fig. 3e.\nThe diodes provide a free-wheeling path for the output\ncurrent, resulting in state of 0 V output voltage [ 50]. The\nNPC half-bridge topology functions in the same way as the\nhalf-bridge, but it has less current ripple, better efﬁciency\nand a constant common mode voltage [ 56], inhibiting\nleakage currents. The NPC topology’s voltage derivative\nand performance are also similar to full-bridge topology\nwith unipolar PWM modulation that is three-level output\ninverter voltage. Therefore, the performance of both the\nconverter and the output ﬁlter is comparable to a unipolar\nPWM modulated full-bridge [ 51].\nThis topology, however, has a number of disadvantages.\nIt requires a high input voltage, several power semicon-\nductors and a high capacity bank of capacitors [ 46, 62],\nwhich makes twice the full-bridge input voltage [ 50].\nAnother problem is the transient overvoltage in internal\ntransistors because of lack of parallel capacitors [ 63]. This\n646 Mohsen SHAYESTEGAN\n123\nproblem, however, can be solved by a snubber circuit.\nMoreover, not the same level of power loss occurs in all of\nthe semiconductors [ 64]. Table 1 shows the efﬁciency,\nleakage current and input voltage of several previously\nvalidated methods. Nevertheless, determining the best\nmethod is difﬁcult because each method has its own\nstrengths and weaknesses.\n8 Control structures for grid connected PV\nsystems\nSinusoidal current is injected into the grid by DC/AC\ninverters. The inverter transforms the DC power into AC\npower for grid injection. Control is an important part of the\nsystem PV linked to the grid. Two types of controllers are\nused in these systems: /C192 MPP controller that mainly\nextracts the maximum power from the PV module; `\nInverter controller that controls DC-link voltage, active and\nreactive power fed into the grid, grid synchronization and\nthe injected power.\nThe control structure has two controllers that work in\ntwo cascaded loops: an external voltage loop that regulates\nthe DC-link voltage, and a fast internal current loop that\ncontrols the grid current or voltage. The DC-link voltage\ncontroller balances the system’s power ﬂow. Typically, the\nexternal controller is intended to do optimal control and\nensure the stability of systems with slow dynamics. The\nstability time in this loop should be 5–20 times more than\nthat in the internal current loop. The external and internal\nloops work separately; therefore, the transfer role of the\ncurrent control loop is not considered in the design of the\nvoltage controller [ 35, 65–67]. Sometimes, the controller\nuses a cascaded DC-link voltage loop with an internal\npower loop rather than a current loop. In this way, the\ninjected current is controlled indirectly. Figure 4 shows the\ncontrol structure of a single phase inverter with a DC/DC\nconverter, as introduced by Ciobotaru et al [ 68]. A current-\ncontrolled H-bridge PWM inverter with low-pass output\nﬁlters is the most popular control structure for the DC/AC\ngrid converter.\n8.1 MPPT control\nTo get the maximum power in the inverter, a maximum\npower point tracker (MPPT) is needed. This is achieved by\nregulating the operating current and voltage of the con-\nverter so that it remains close to MPP all the time. In\nMPPT, voltage and current of the PV array are detected by\nvoltage and current sensors at a particular sampling cycle,\nrespectively [ 69]. The values are then entered in a MPPT\nblock that calculates the MPP. The MPP provides the ref-\nerence values for voltage and current, which are trans-\nformed to a power value that should match the calculated\nvalue. If there is a difference, the converter’s duty cycle is\nadjusted. When the reference value and the measured\npower match, it means that the array is already working at\nmaximum power. The converter is typically based on the\nstandard non-isolated, boost or buck–boost topology. The\nmost important advantage of the MPPT is its ability to ﬁnd\nthe MPP as fast and efﬁciently as possible. A number of\nalgorithms can be used for the MPPT [ 70–72], including\nthe incremental conductance, perturb and observe, constant\nvoltage and parasitic capacitance. Incremental conductance\nand perturb and observe algorithms are the most\ncommon.\nPerturb and observe (P&O) method has attracted much\nattention because of its simplicity [ 13, 72]. In this method,\nthe system current is disturbed by a perturbation in the duty\ncycle of the converter and consequently, it perturbs the PV\nsystem voltage.\nAs it can be seen in Fig. 5, clearly when the power\noperating on the left side needs to increase the voltage, the\none operating on the right side needs to decrease the\nvoltage. Therefore, when the power increases, the next duty\nFig. 4 Control structure topology for single phase two stage inverter\nTable 1 Major characteristics of different transformer-less\ntopologies\nMethods Leakage\ncurrent\nInput voltage (V) Efﬁciency\nHalf H-bridge [ 55] Moderate 800 -\nFull H-bridge [ 52] Moderate 400 ?\nNPC [ 61] Very low 400 ??\nDual-buck [ 49] Low 400 ????\nFC [ 95] Very low 400 ????\nH5 [ 96] Low 400 ???\nSingle-buck [ 97] Moderate 400 ???\nHB-ZVR [ 98] Moderate 400 ?\nHERIC [ 99] Low 400 ???\nH6 [ 100] Moderate 800 ??\nOverview of grid-connected two-stage transformer-less inverter design 647\n123\ncycle should remain constant to obtain the maximum\npower point, while when the power decreases the duty\ncycle should be reversed to reach the MPP. This process is\niterated until the system reaches the MPP. Owing to the\nease of application and simplicity of the P&O technique, it\nis the most popular method in practice [ 13, 72].\nThis method has two major problems: /C192 determining the\nconvergence rate of the tracking MPP; ` determining the\noscillation amplitude. For large perturbations, the MPP is\ntracked faster, but causes higher oscillation amplitude. For\nsmall perturbations, the convergence rate is reduced, but\nthe oscillation around the MPP is decreased as well. This\nresults in a decline in steady oscillations around the MPP.\nTo solve this, modiﬁed versions of P&O have been\ndeveloped [ 73].\nVarious MPPT methods have been proposed [ 73–82],\neach with its own pros and cons, and it is quite difﬁcult to\ndecide which method to use. In fact, the decision depends\non the speciﬁc application. For example, in solar vehicles\nthe priority is fast convergence to the MPP. In this case, the\nintelligent methods are the most suitable option. In the case\nof space satellites, where reliability and performance of the\nMPPT are the most important factors and MPP tracking\nneeds to be done almost in real-time, Hill-climbing meth-\nods such as P&O are the best choice. Characteristics of\ndifferent MPPT techniques, i.e. complexity, convergence\nspeed, and PV module dependency, are summarized in\nTable 2.\n8.2 DC/AC inverter control\nTo control the output current, a control system is\nrequired that can automatically regulate the duty cycle. The\nDC/AC controller has two control loops: the external DC-\nbus voltage control loop, and the internal current control\nloop. The internal control loop controls sudden changes in\nAC current to maintain a sinusoidal current. A PLL sinu-\nsoidal signal reference generates the reference current ( I\nref),\nwhich synchronizes the grid voltage with the output\ninverter current [ 68, 83, 84]. The amplitude current is\ncontrolled by the external voltage loop. The external loop\ncontrols the DC-bus voltage ( Vdc). This voltage should be\nlimited; however, controlling Vdc is required for controlling\nthe power fed into the grid.\n9 Power quality\nAn important consideration in power quality is that,\naccording to the standards (e.g. IEEE Std 519-1992) the\noutput waveform should obtain low level of THD. The\npower conversion process can endanger quality [ 85].\nPower quality consists of current quality and voltage\nquality [ 86]. Current and voltage quality are related to\ndeviations from the standards [ 87]. A single-frequency sine\nwave of constant frequency and amplitude has perfect\nquality [ 87]. Harmonics, voltage ﬂickers, voltage dips and\nnoise are examples of problems that negatively affect\npower quality. The most important of these problems is\nharmonics [ 86], which can cause decreased volt-ampere\ncapacity, equipment overheating, current and voltage\nwaveform distortion and increased losses [ 88]. The har-\nmonic level is determined by the THD value, which is a\nmeasure of similarity of shape between a waveform and its\nmain mechanisms [ 30]. Inverter output involves harmonics\nthat might be harmful to the loads. Therefore, the inverter\nmust use ﬁlters prior to sending power to the loads [ 89]. In\naddition, in inverters, and generally power converters, the\nquality of DC input voltage has an important role in the\nquality of the output waveform [ 90]. Accordingly, one way\nof enhancing the quality of the output waveform is ﬁltering\nthe DC input voltage. Generally, the second order low-pass\nLC ﬁlter is used for this purpose. It is simple and inex-\npensive and can decrease the output waveform’s higher\nharmonics components.\nFig. 5 Characteristic of PV panel power curve\nTable 2 Major characteristics of different MPPT methods\nMethod True\nMPPT\nConvergence\nspeed\nTuning Complexity\nP&O [ 73] YES Fast NO Medium\nIC [ 74] YES Varies YES High\nFuzzy [ 75] YES Fast YES High\nNN [ 76] YES Fast YES Medium\nGA [ 77] YES Fast YES Low\nVoc [ 78] NO Medium YES Medium\nIsc [ 79] NO Medium NO Low\nDC-link\n[80]\nNO Medium YES High\nESC [ 81] YES Fast NO High\nTemp [ 82] YES Medium YES Low\n648 Mohsen SHAYESTEGAN\n123\n10 Grid synchronization techniques\nTraditionally, synchronization of grid connected DC/AC\ninverters is done by duplicating the grid voltage in a way\nthat grid voltage and output current reference are in the\nsame phase [ 91]. This technique is simple; however, it has\na number of disadvantages. It transfers the grid transients\nand distortions to distort the output current, which is\nundesirable for grid-connected uses. Furthermore, this\nmethod does not enable inverters to control reactive power\nﬂow. Single phase grid connected inverters generally use\nphase locked loops (PLL). Stationary frame PLLs do not\nneed extra signals, and therefore, they only take the grid\nvoltage as input. A typical stationary frame PLL uses a\nvoltage controlled oscillator (VCO), a loop ﬁlter (LF) and a\nsinusoidal multiplier phase detector (PD). Thacker et al.\nmodiﬁed the stationary frame PLLs by adding extra state\nfeedback terms [ 92], which improved immunity to input\ndisturbances and noise, increased synchronization speed,\nand eliminated the double-line frequency ripple term cre-\nated by the PD.\n11 Requirements of grid\nGrid-connected PV systems should adhere to certain\nstandards speciﬁc to each country, such as EN 50106, IEEE\n1547.1-2005, IEC61727 and VDE0126-1-1. These stan-\ndards deal with issues like individual harmonic current\nlevels, total harmonic distortion (THD), leakage current,\ninjected DC current level, range of frequency and voltage\nfor regular operation, detection of islanding operation,\npower factor (PF), automatic reconnection, synchronization\nand grounding of the system [ 35, 93]. In Germany, the\nVDE-0126-1-1 standard is the only one addressing leakage\ncurrent levels or faults in transformer-less PV inverters.\nAccording to this standard, when the RMS of leakage\ncurrent is above 30 mA, it takes 0.3 s to disconnect the\ninverter from the grid. Table 3 shows RMS values of the\nleakage current or faults and their disconnection times.\n12 Proposed grid connected system\nA grid-connected photovoltaic system uses PV panels in\nparallel or series to convert sunlight to DC power, and\nconverters to convert AC current to DC current. There also\nexist DC/DC converters that are used to keep the PV sys-\ntem at maximum power operation. In this study, the input\nenergy was generated using a PV panel. The PV panel is\nconnected to the DC/DC boost converter. The boost con-\nverter uses the soft switching technique to boost the DC\ninput voltage (100 V to 400 V). The system was further\nmodiﬁed and was connected to a grid to become a grid-\nconnected system. AC current was created by a new single-\nphase transformer-less inverter using the sinusoidal pulse\nwidth modulation technique and synchronized utility grid.\nThe power fed from the PV device was controlled by\ncontrolling the frequency and duty cycle of switches S\n1 and\nS2. Controlling frequency and duty cycles ensures power\nﬂow through the sources and between the source and the\nload.\nFigure 6 shows the proposed two stage single phase\ntransformer-less inverter, which consists of a resonant\nboost converter with an additional switch and a full bridge\ninverter with two additional switches SW 5 and SW 6. In the\nboost converter both switches (S 1 and S 2) are IGBT tran-\nsistors because of zero current switching. The switches\nSW1-SW4 are high frequency MOSFET switches and the\nswitches SW 5 and SW 6 are low frequency IGBT switches\n[94]. Furthermore, two extra capacitors connect switches\nSW2 and SW 4 to eliminate the leakage current. In the\nsecond stage, the two phase leg including SW 1-SW4\nswitches operating at the switching frequency, and two\nadditional switches SW 5 and SW 6 operating at the grid\nfrequency were added. In the positive half cycle, SW 5 is\nalways on and SW 1 and SW 4 commutate at the switching\nfrequency in order to produce Vdc and 0 states. Likewise, in\nTable 3 Leakage current values and their corresponding disconnec-\ntion times listed in VDE 0126-1-1 standard\nLeakage current value (mA) Disconnection time (s)\n30 0.3\n60 0.15\n100 0.04\nSW1\nSW2\nPV\nS1\nA\nVpv\nC1\nS2\nLr\nD1\nC2\n~\nSW4\nD4 C4\nSW3\nB\nL1 L2\nD3\nCr D\nCdc\nSW5\nD5\nSW6\nD6\nVg\nC0D2\nMPPT \ncontroller\nVpv\nS1\nS2\nDC/AC\ncontroller\nSW1\nSW2\nSW3\nSW4\nSW5\nSW6\nVbus\nig\nVbus\nFig. 6 Proposed two stage PV system\nOverview of grid-connected two-stage transformer-less inverter design 649\n123\nthe negative half cycle, SW 6 is always on and SW 3 and\nSW2 commutate at the switching frequency to create – Vdc\nand 0 states. The proposed inverter was simulated in PSIM\nsoftware. The candidate panel is assumed to generate a\nmaximum power of 500 W. Details of the proposed panel\nused in the proposed Simulink model are shown in\nTable 4.\nThe operational characteristics of the proposed inverter\nwas also analyzed. Design details of the proposed inverter\nare explained below. Power, input voltage, and DC output\nvoltage of the system were arbitrarily chosen to be 500 W,\n100 V and 400 V, respectively. Voltage gain (A) was\napproximately 4. A 40 lF capacitor was selected for input\nDC ﬁltering. The resonant frequency was set to 50 KHz.\nFor the selected resonance inductor and capacitor we had\nL\nf = 100 lH and Cf = 100 nF. The total design parame-\nters of the simulated system are shown in Table 5.R e a l\neffects, such as dead time delays and non-ideality of\ncomponents were also considered in simulation, so that real\nand simulated performance were as close as possible.\nFigure 7 shows the block diagram of a MPPT controller.\nFirst, the power of the converter is calculated using current\nand voltage values. Second, maximum power is calculated\nusing current and MPP voltage values and P&O method.\nAfterward, the calculated power value is compared with the\nprevious power value. The calculated value is used to\ndecide about the direction of further changes in frequency\nand duty cycle. If change in power is positive, the change\nin frequency (d F) will be also be positive. Otherwise, the\nchange in frequency (d F) will be negative. Finally, the\ncalculated frequency is divided by the maximum switching\nfrequency (47 kHz) to determine the value of duty\ncycle.\nThe proposed controller is designed as a double loop\ncontrol system, in which the outer loop is used to regulate\nthe DC bus voltage, while the inner loop regulates the AC\nline current. The inner loop has a high bandwidth, in order\nto provide fast dynamic responses. G\nv and Gi are PI con-\ntrollers. The magnitude of the output current ( Ig) is given\nby the outer loop ( Gv). This value is then multiplied by sine\ntable in phase (sin /) with the grid voltage. In the ﬁnal step,\nerror followed by PI controller and proper SPWM is\ngenerated.\nFigure 8 shows voltage and current waveforms of the\nboost converter’s switches. Switches S1 and S2 are turned\non and off under zero current switching (ZCS). The current\npassing through the switches is sinusoidal, reducing\nswitching loss.\nTable 4 Characteristics of proposed PV panel\nParameters Values\nMaximum power ( Pmax) 500 W\nVoltage at maximum power ( Vmax) 105 V\nCurrent at maximum Power ( Imax)5 A\nShort circuit current ( Isc) 5.7 A\nOpen circuit voltage ( Voc) 115 V\nTable 5 Simulation parameters\nParameters Values\nInput voltage 100 V\nDC voltage ( Vdc) 400 V\nRated power 500 W\nResonant inductor ( L\nf) 100 lH\nResonant capacitor ( Cf) 100 nF\nDC capacitor ( Cdc) 400 lF\nInput capacitor ( Ci)5 0 lF\nSwitching frequency (DC/DC) 47 kHz\nMOSFET switch frequency (DC/AC) 20 kHz\nIGBT switch frequency (DC/AC) 50 Hz\nFilter inductor ( L\n1,2)1 0 m H\nFilter capacitor ( Co) 0.2 lF\nExtra capacitors 0.5 nF\nCalculate P\nP&O\nCalculate Pmpp\ndP=dP(k)− dP(k− 1)\ndP=0?\ndP>0?Fs=Fs− dF\nD=Fs/Fmax\nReturn\nFs=Fs+dF\nMeasure Ipv and \nVpv\nN\nY\nYN\nVmpp\nVpv\nIpv\nFig. 7 Flowchart of MPPT controller of proposed DC/DC converter\n(ﬁrst stage)\n650 Mohsen SHAYESTEGAN\n123\nFigure 9 shows the simulated current and voltage\nwaveforms. The results show that (when working at full\npower) the proposed inverter and its controller can inject\nthe input power into the grid with lower harmonic distor-\ntion (THD = 3.58%) and unity power factor. Figure 10\nshows the simulated results of common mode voltage\n(V\nCM), VAN, VBN. As it can be seen, when voltages VAN and\nVBN do not ﬂuctuate, VCM and VP remain constant, and thus\nthe leakage current ( Icm) is reduced considerably.\nFigure 11 shows the simulation results under varying\nirradiance from 100% to 50%. The results show that the\nperformance of the proposed system is satisfactory when\nworking under changing irradiance. When irradiance is\n1000 W/m\n2, the AC current is approximately 2.1 A, and\nwhen the radiation drops to 500 W/m 2, the AC current\napproaches 1 A without any overshoot. As can be seen,\nmaximum voltage is tracked by an MPPT controller. The\nproposed controller in the second stage maintains a proper\nDC voltage to ensure that the voltage is within a suit-\nable range. In addition, RMS value of the leakage current\n(I\ncm) is below 15 mA that satisﬁes the standards given by\nVDE-0126-1-1.

It discussed DC/DC boost converters that\nboost the voltage of the current received from PV panels. It\nbecame clear that soft switching converters perform satis-\nfactorily at high frequencies in reducing switching losses,\ndecreasing the inductor and capacitor size, and increasing\nefﬁciency. Voltage-source inverters, such as full-bridge\ninverters and half bridge inverters, and their strengths and\nweaknesses were also discussed. Transformer-less inverters\nare used to improve the efﬁciency, lower the costs, and\ndecrease the size. They were introduced to minimize the\nleakage current and enhance efﬁciency. A system was also\nproposed in this study that aimed to reduce the leakage\ncurrent. It was able to provide a high quality output current\nand decrease the THD.\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License ( http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted\nuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a\nlink to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were\nmade.\nReferences\n[1] Demirbas A (2009) Global renewable energy projections.\nEnergy Sources Part B Econ Plan Policy 4(2):212–224\n[2] Fulekar MH (2010) Environmental biotechnology.
