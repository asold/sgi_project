  "abstract": "In an Augmented Reality (AR) system using a brick-based tangible user interface, we present and evaluate alternative techniques for scene navigation. Going from two-dimensional brick-based input to three- dimensional navigation presents design issues. There are two fundamental methods for scene control: scene handling or viewpoint handling. The system has two views (plan and side), presenting action-perception spaces which are coincident and separate. Four tools were developed to explore design solutions, testing the alternative methods in each view. In a quantitative user experiment with a search-and-position task, we evaluated the four tools, measuring performance by trial completion time. Results showed that scene and viewpoint handling performed equally well in the plan view. In the side view, scene handling performed better. Subjective ranking showed that scene handling was always preferred to viewpoint handling. Results indicate that when action- perception spaces are coincident, the choice of handling method is less critical than when separate.",
