    "abstract": "This paper examines near-term generative large language models (GenLLM) for cybersecurity applications. We experimentally study three common use cases, namely the use of GenLLM as a digital assistant, analysts for threat hunting and incident response, and analysts for access management in zero trust systems. In particular, we establish that one of the most common GenLLMs, ChatGPT, can pass cybersecurity certification exams for security fundamentals, hacking and penetration testing, and mobile device security, as well as perform competitively in cybersecurity ethics assessments. We also identify issues associated with hallucinations in these environments. The ability of ChatGPT to analyze network scans and security logs is also evaluated. Finally, we attempt to jailbreak ChatGPT in order to assess its application to access management systems.",
