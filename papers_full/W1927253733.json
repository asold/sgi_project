This study analysedstudents’ online utterances and offline interactions, to determine the extent ofcollaborative learning among students from two colleges. Results show thatbehaviours that characterise successful collaborative learning in an asynchronousnetworked environment were present, but the patterns were different from previousstudies. The implementation of ICT tools in blended learning does promote socialinteraction among students and their engagement; however, it does not automaticallyfacilitate students in their adoption of active learning strategies. The offlineatmosphere in carrying out the ACMC activities were sorted into five major categories:struggling with platform operations, handling technical problems, passive attitudestowards the procedure, tense atmosphere in class, and engagement in tasks. Based onthe findings, some pedagogical implications are presented.IntroductionGiven that language learning is facilitated when students use language to performmeaningful tasks based on practices that people do in the real world (Edwards &Willis, 2005), pedagogical approaches to using computer assisted language learning(CALL) and information and communication technologies (ICT) are shifting to formswhich better exploit the communication, collaboration, and negotiation aspects of theInternet (Curtis & Lawson, 2001; Hoven, 2006; Meyer, 2004; Murphy, 2004). Learningon the Internet is highly compatible with social constructivism, which emphasises themanner in which learners actively construct their knowledge on the basis of what theyalready know through social interaction in learning contexts, rather than passivelyreceive knowledge in a pre-packaged form (Self, Karakirik, Kor, Tedesco & Dimitrova,2000; Vygotsky, 1978). Research into CMC (computer mediated communication), forexample, indicates the significant potential of text-based interaction within thesociocultural perspective (Kitade, 2008; Payne & Ross, 2005). Studies of both SCMC(synchronous CMC) and ACMC (asynchronous CMC) have investigated the extent towhich online interaction with peers impact learners’ language development (Belz, &Kinginger, 2002; Berg, 1999; Pawan, Paulus, Yalcin & Chang, 2003, Schellens & Valcke,2006; Warschauer, 2002).However, most of the previous studies on computer conferencing systems in educationfocus mainly on asynchronous online discussion (Hrastinski, 2009). The increasing useof innovative blended learning strategies which incorporate online discussion into in\nWang 831class, face to face settings, and rapid developments in the use of ICT in highereducation (An & Frick, 2006; Chen & Looi, 2007; Ginns & Ellis, 2009; Ng & Cheung,2007) require the examination of ACMC in class activities to fully understand thelearners' total engagement (Kitade, 2008) and the contribution of such ICT tools tostudent learning (Ginns & Ellis, 2009; Hourigan & Murray, 2010). To understand onlinecollaborative characteristics and offline interaction among students from two differentcolleges in a blended learning environment, this study analysed students’ onlineutterances to determine the extent of collaborative learning in online interaction. Inaddition, students’ offline atmosphere in class was observed to reveal the possibleimpact of the implementation of in class online discussion upon in class activities.Finally, learners’ perceptions of the value of such a blended ACMC learning activityfor language learning were examined.Literature reviewCurrently, many educators are focusing their efforts on the design and implementationof more active and collaborative methods of teaching and learning, in order to betterprepare learners for the team work and project/problem solving approaches necessaryfor work places in the 21st century (Moisseeva, Steinbeck & Seufert, 2007). Variouskinds of CMC, both synchronous and asynchronous, explore the interactivedimensions of such text-based interactions within a Vygotskian socioculturalperspective, and suggest that CMC facilitates learner-centred communication,promotes critical thinking, enhances knowledge construction, and creates collaborativelearning communities (Felix, 2002; Ferdig & Trammel, 2004; Levy & Kennedy, 2004;Loewen & Erlam, 2006).Asynchronous CMC (ACMC) enables language learners to engage in interactions witha wider range of interlocutors because ACMC is not bounded by the limits of time orspace (Hanson-Smith, 1997; Kitade, 2008). This facilitates participation among studentsbecause it allows all students an equal opportunity to respond to a topic (Birch &Volkov, 2007; Branon & Essex, 2001; Ortega, 1997), and is also conducive to thepresentation of heterogeneous perspectives (Chen & Looi, 2007; Moisseeva, Steinbeck,& Seufert, 2007). Consequently students learn to express themselves, are exposed toalternative points of view, and are better positioned to respect differences in opinions,since none of the participants can easily dominate the discussion (Branon & Essex,2001; Ortega, 1997). Furthermore, the asynchronous features also provide learners withmore time to think and edit. Students involved in online discussions create morethoughtful responses because they have more time to process input (Abrams, 2003)and to reflect on what they want to express (Althaus, 1996).Learner-centred online discussion forums can facilitate learners’ construction ofknowledge through collaboration in groups by providing the requisite environmentfor the social negotiation of meaning (Ng & Cheung, 2007; Romiszowski & Mason,2004). Students who use English as a second language or a foreign language tend tohave less experience of critically engaging in the course content in face to facediscussion probably because it is ‘face threatening’ (Birch & Volkov, 2007; Chen &Looi, 2007; Liu & Jackson, 2008). Chun (1994) found that students who were involvedin CMC produce more language through questioning, clarifying, and feedback givingthan in traditional classrooms. Chen and Looi (2007) also indicated that onlinediscussion contains more opportunities for the practice of in depth clarification and\n832 Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 2010, 26(6)inferencing skills. By engaging learners in deeper language processing, CMC has greatpotential to increase the quality and quantity of learner output.The amount and quality of interaction among participants is widely acknowledged tobe an indicator of successful online learning experiences, as interaction has been foundto contribute to both achievement and student satisfaction (Guzdial & Turns, 2000;Roblyer & Wiencke, 2004). Interaction among course participants helps them applyand integrate newly gained knowledge in the course of engaging in group activity. Arange of behaviours that characterise successful collaborative learning in anasynchronous networked environment, including on task activities, social chat, mutualexplanations, and other regulatory behaviours, have been identified in Curtis andLawson’s (2001) study. However, few researchers explore how the interactions in classinfluence online interaction. Kitade (2008) suggests that studies on ACMC shouldaddress the role of offline interactions, or the learners' engagement in combined onlineand offline interactions, to gain a more complete understanding of how learnersactually benefit from carrying out CMC tasks.The approach of combining face to face instruction with computer mediatedinstruction is called blended learning (Bonk & Graham, 2005), which has been adoptedby many educators in higher education (An & Frick, 2006; Chen & Looi, 2007; Ng &Cheung, 2007). As an alternative to traditional face to face instruction and CMCactivities, blended learning represents an attempt to amplify the strengths of eachenvironment while at the same time minimising their weaknesses. For example, thelack of rich communication seems to affect the time taken to complete communicationsor tasks in CMC (An & Frick, 2006) but students were linguistically more creative andsophisticated during CMC (Blake, 2005; Kern, 1995; Warschauer, 2002). DeSanctis andMonge (1998) claimed that CMC is more effective than face to face communication fordivergent tasks such as idea generation, while face to face communication is moreeffective for convergent tasks, such as decision making, which require interdependenceon others. Chen and Looi (2007) and Ng and Cheung (2007) pointed out thatintegrating online discussion into the flow of the instruction in the classroom providedlearners with ample time to foster habits of critical thinking, reflection, and articulationof their viewpoints, which can subsequently promote further in class oral discussionsor outside class online discussions.The quality of interaction is of equal importance in both face to face and onlineenvironment. Ginns and Ellis (2009) emphasise that blended learning experienceprovides a mix of both online and face to face experiences, which support each other inachieving desired learning outcomes. Thus evaluating the quality of blended learningrequires relating the 'part' of the online learning context, such as online activities anddiscussions, to the 'whole' of the student experience including the totality of bothonline and face to face learning experiences. In light of the literature reviewed, thisstudy investigated collaborative communication among students from two differentcolleges in an ACMC environment. Specifically, this study sought to examine thesubjects’ collaborative characteristics among online interlocutors and their interactionwith offline peers. The research questions addressed in this study are as follows:1.What are the online collaborative characteristics of the two groups of students?2.What are the offline interactions of the two groups in their own classes?\nWang 833MethodParticipantsTwo groups of subjects from Applied English Departments, 25 students from a collegein southern Taiwan (College A hereafter) and 50 students from a college in centralTaiwan (College B), participated in this study. Their English proficiency is aboutintermediate level (about TOEIC 550). All of the participants were first year studentsand had experiences using CMC, such as email and chat room. They took part in thestudy as part of their regular English class. The students’ class met for two hours eachweek. The first four weeks of their courses were used to collect data for the presentstudy. Students were grouped into 12 groups for the project. Each of the discussiongroups consisted of a random selection of two students from college A and fourstudents from College B. During the data collection process, they accomplished thereading and discussion tasks under the guidance of the same instructor.Tasks and procedureThe participants were involved in this project for a total of four weeks. During the firstweek, an instructional manual informing the participants about the study and platformwas distributed. The instructor also gave an orientation about how the project wasimplemented to make sure that the participants understood the whole process. TheUbiquitous Hospitality English Learning Platform (U-HELP) (Wang, 2009) was used in thisstudy. Students first read three hospitality featured articles (Welcome to Taiwan: HotelAccommodation; the Top 10 Taiwan Destinations among Foreign Tourists, and Night MarketSnacks) on the U-HELP (Figure 1). Afterwards, they discussed the questions providedby the instructor on the discussion board (Figure 2) with their group mates (arequirement) or with other groups (an option). The procedure for the online readingand discussion activities was as follows:1.They read three reading selections located under Teachers’ Portfolio/ ReadingClub.2.Whenever students finished one reading selection, they wrote down the main ideasand summary on the Interaction/ Discussion Board.3.Students were required to answer the three discussion questions relevant to thethree reading selections in the group blogs after class.4.Each group had a chairperson who was responsible for posting the first messageafter finishing each reading article.5.In the discussion process, each group could continue the same topic until everyFriday, and the Chair drew a conclusion. Every member was required to reply toother group members’ postings at least twice a week.6.Each group needed to reply to another group’s discussion content at least onceevery week.7.They were encouraged to give feedback to any other group’s blog.8.During the discussion process, all forms of instant online messenger services (e.g.MSN, Yahoo Messenger, or Skype) were not allowed. They could only use U-HELPblogs to communicate with each other. When they finished the three articles, theyfilled in a post-reading activity questionnaire and wrote a report.\n834 Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 2010, 26(6)\nFigure 1: A sample page for a hospitality featured article\n \n Figure 2: A sample page for a project blog\nWang 835The instructor monitored the online discussion and gave comments and guidance inclass without directly participating in the online group discussion. In other words, thepresence of the instructor is limited to the offline context. When the students wereconducting the online activities in class, the instructor observed the class atmosphereand took notes. In addition, students were required to write weekly journals to reflecton the classroom atmosphere. The framework of the study is illustrated in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: The framework of the studyData analysesThe data came from three resources: (1) messages on the weekly post-readingquestions on blogs, (2) the instructors’ observation notes and (3) the students’ weeklyjournals. The messages generated by the subjects during the ACMC interaction wereanalysed according to a coding scheme adapted from Curtis and Lawson (2001), toreveal the students’ collaborative communicative characteristics. In Curtis andLawson’s coding scheme, there are five major behavioural categories, and under eachcategory are sub-codes. The major behavioural categories are planning, contributing,seeking input, reflecting/monitoring, and social inter-racial interacting socially. Thesecond category, “contributing,” is designated as “task-orientated interaction” in Buluand Yildirim’s (2008) study because the codes within this category are related to thereading and discussion activity students performed in the study. In addition, theresearcher modified the last part of Curtis and Lawson’s coding scheme, socialinteraction, in which the category is divided into two sub-codes: literal socialinteraction (LSI) and graphical image (GI). The adapted coding scheme with samples isillustrated in Table 1. The examples within each category of the coding scheme areculled from the data obtained in this study. This coding scheme was used because ofthe need to identify the classical elements of collaboration in an online environment.In addition, both the instructors’ notes and the students’ weekly journals went througha category construction approach (Bogdan & Biklen, 1992). This approach consists oforganisation of the data sources, reduction of the text, and generation of conceptual\nSubjects25 English-majorstudents from ahospitalitycollegeand50 English-majorstudents from auniversity ofscience andtechnology\nData-Messages inthe blog-Classroomobservationnotes-Weeklyjournals\nActivities1.The platform demonstr-ation and task giving:a.article readingb.main idea orsummary writingc.post-reading blogdiscussion2.Blog activities:a.Group classificationb.The group leaderformulationc.Discussion3.Evaluation of the project\n836 Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 2010, 26(6)categories by coding units of the data. When the data were examined, codingcategories were assigned to the units of data. The emerging categories and sampleswere presented in Table 2. Unrelated data were deleted during the coding process.After that, the coded data were reported based on the categories generated during theanalysis of data. Such a process verified that the instructor did not miss importantstudent-student interactions in the classroom.Table 1: The coding scheme adapted from Curtis and Lawson (2001)BehaviourcategoriesCodesDescriptionExamplesGSGroup skills: a generic code appl-ied to expressions that encouragegroup activity and cohesiveness.G1: group1, fighting!!!G12: GO!

(Week 2)The above data were coded by the researcher and her assistant (Master’s degree inTESOL), inter-rater reliability between the two coders was kappa = 0.71. According toAltman, (1991), values between 0.60 and 0.80 may be taken to represent substantialagreement beyond chance. The value of this study can be interpreted as substantialagreement. Afterwards, the two coders discussed the discrepancies in thecategorisation of the items one by one until agreement on categorisation was reached.\n838 Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 2010, 26(6)Results and discussionsTranscripts of the messages posted to the blog server were the principal data source forthe first research question: What are the online collaborative characteristics of the twogroups of students? The results are shown in Table 3. Two prominent communicativebehaviors in this study are social interaction (SI) (42% of the total postings) and task-oriented interaction (TI) (40% of the total postings). The other three categories werecomparatively low. Planning was fairly low, at 7.1%, and seeking input was onlyslightly higher, at 8.8%. Reflection and monitoring was the lowest, accounting for only2.6% of the total coded data. There were few exchanges seeking to monitor groupeffort or reflecting on the use of the medium.Table 3: Subjects’ online collaborative behavioursOnline collaborative behavioursCode totalsCode (%)Total (%)Group skills13 2.4Organising work22 4.1PlanningInitiating activities3 0.67.1\nFeedback giving55 10.3Exchanging resources and information6 1.1Sharing knowledge11721.9Challenging others5 0.9\nTask-orientedinteraction\nExplaining or elaborating28 5.2\n39.5\nFeedback seeking44 8.2Seeking inputAdvocating effort3 0.68.8Monitoring group effort11 2.2Reflection/monitoringReflecting on medium3 0.62.6Literal social interaction17232.2SocialinteractionGraphical image52 9.741.9Total 534100%100%The above results are different from Curtis and Lawson’s (2001) study, in whichapproximately equal distribution of the behaviours of planning, task-orientedinteraction, seeking input, reflection/monitoring was found. Moreover, SI, the topfrequency of all the behaviours in this study, ranked as the lowest frequency (4%) of allthe behaviours in their study. Possible explanations are that students in distanceeducation programs need to build up the sense of community to attract and retainlearners (Rovi, 2001). Accordingly, students in this study employed SI the mostfrequently. Within SI, literal social interaction appeared 172 times (32% of the totalutterance), which included simple greetings such as “Hi, nice to meet you” and“How’s everything?” In addition, graphic images expressing their mood, such as \n,were found. As Vonderwell (2002) suggests, due to the absence of social cues such asbody language, ASMC might minimise the richness of communication and impedestudent learning. The use of those graphic images in this study might be a supplementto the absence of social cues. These kinds of social interactions in the blogs helped thetwo groups break the ice and maintain the interaction. Consequently, the sense ofcommunity could be sustained.With regard to task-oriented interaction, sharing knowledge (SK) and feedback giving(FBG) are the first and the second, respectively, in terms of frequency. Owing to thedesign of the project, participants were required to answer and discuss weekly post-reading questions; therefore, it is perfectly reasonable to see the high frequency ofknowledge sharing and feedback giving among their discussion processes. The low\nWang 839percentage of the other categories might be attributed to the short period of the project.Students might have been devoting most of their time to the task and lacked time toreflect on their learning. Another possible explanation for this phenomenon may be themanner in which English teaching and learning are approached in Taiwan, tending tobe test-oriented and decontextualised (Shih &Yang, 2008). In Taiwan, discretegrammar practice and mechanical drills are the focus of most English classes prior tocollege level, which exacerbates learners’ lack of confidence and language competencein communicating with others in English. Similar results are reported by Tse, Yuen,Loh, Lam, and Ng (2010), and Liu and Jackson (2008). Tse, Yuen, Loh, Lam, and Ngfound that primary school students in Hong Kong did not have sufficiently highEnglish reading proficiency to cope with and comprehend advanced English blogs. InLiu and Jackson’s (2008) study, the unwillingness of Chinese undergraduate, non-English majors to communicate and their foreign language anxiety correlatedsignificantly with each other and with their self-rated English proficiency.Table 4: Groups’ online collaborative behavioursBehavioursGroup codesA: NKHCB: NTITPlanningTask-orientedinteractionSeekinginputReflection/monitoringSocialinteractionTotal(frequency)A 4 8 4 2 21 39G1B 0 16 2 0 13 31A 3 14 4 0 2 23G2B 0 9 2 0 4 15A 2 14 4 0 6 26G3B 1 6 2 0 4 13A 1 9 2 2 10 24G4B 1 18 1 0 5 25A 0 3 0 0 5 8G5B 0 2 1 0 7 10A 0 11 3 0 8 22G6B 0 7 1 0 4 12A 1 13 2 0 7 23G7B 3 7 1 0 16 27A 0 7 2 0 21 30G8B 1 9 1 0 3 14A 2 11 4 4 24 45G9B 0 3 1 0 4 8A 3 15 4 1 9 32G10B 0 2 0 0 0 2A 3 4 0 2 10 20G11B 0 4 1 0 2 7A 5 13 3 3 28 52G12B 8 6 2 0 10 26Totals38 211 47 146224534(%) 7.1 39.58.8 2.6 41.9100Concerning group performance, there was a wide range in the frequency of interactionacross the 12 groups, from 18 to 78 postings (Table 4). Within each group, there wasalso variation in the pattern of contribution, similar to that reported in Curtis andLawson’s study. Generally speaking, students from College A posted more frequentlythan students from College B (especially for G9, G10, and G11). Take Group 10 forexample: although students from College A contributed 32 posting, students fromCollege B made only 2 postings. In this case, online interaction between the two\n840 Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 2010, 26(6)colleges did not occur. However, when there was no response from College B, thegroup members from College A continued the discussion on their own. For moresuccessful interaction, the four groups G1, G4, G7, and G12 are illustrative. Here“successful interaction” is defined as more exchanges among students from bothcolleges. G1 and G12 provided the most successful discussion results regardless oftheir various discussion patterns. The results from offline interaction might account forthe unequal distribution of the online contributions to a certain extent.Now, let us turn to the second research question. Students’ offline interaction in classwas observed and their weekly journals were analysed. The results were shown inTable 5. The interactions among offline peers were classified into five major categories:struggling with platform operation, handling technical problems, passive attitudestowards the procedure, tense atmosphere in class, and engagement in tasks. Each Vstands for one to five times. For instance, in the first week, struggling with platformoperation was identified five times in College A, so a V was given while it occurredfourteen times in College B, so three Vs were given. Therefore, the higher thefrequency of the situation, the more Vs were given. In contrast, if the situation did notexist, an X was shown in the column instead.Table 5: Results of the class observationCategorySchoolsWeek 1Week 2Week 3College AV X XStruggling with platform operationsCollege BVVVVVVCollege AV V XHandling technical problemsCollege BVVVVVVCollege AX V VVPassive attitudes towards the procedureCollege BVVVVVCollege AV X XTense atmosphere in classCollege BVVVV XCollege AVVVVVVVEngagement in tasksCollege BV VVVVStarting with the first category, struggling with platform operations, we can see thatthe condition remained in College B for three weeks despite the decrease of thefrequency. On the contrary, the low frequency found in the first week among studentsin College A remained low throughout the following weeks. Students in College A hadused some functions in the platform for other activities; hence, they needed less time tofamiliarise themselves with the U-HELP compared with students in College B. Thesituation was slightly different in dealing with technical problems. Technical problemsoccurred more frequently in College B than in College A. Even by the third week, thetechnical problems did not disappear.The technical problems might have resulted from the instability of the networksystems or equipment of the colleges and thus hindered students’ interaction. It is notsurprising that learners become dissatisfied and lose their interest and motivationnecessary to continue the tasks when the technology frequently breaks down orprograms crash (Herrington & Oliver, 1997; Hoven, 2003). Several researchers havefound that learners’ perceived value of their learning experience using technologypartially depends on the transparency and robustness of the technology (Downes,2000; Hoven, 2003). Hara and Kling (1999) indicated that technical problems oftenresult in students' disillusionment with web based distance learning. Liu and Yin(2006) also suggested that insufficient computer skills may reduce the effectiveness of\nWang 841online learning. Furthermore, these factors might account for the tense atmospherefound in class during the first week. The interaction was awkward and students feltuneasy, especially for students in College B. Both the U-HELP and the instructor werenew to this large class. In contrast, it took students in College A only one week to getaccustomed to the instructor and the activity. This was most likely the major factorcontributing to the low frequency of blog replies and participants’ negative attitudestowards the ACMC activity.Despite the above problems, participants’ cooperation in handling technical problemswas found in class. Participants from the two schools cooperated with their offlinepeers very well during the first week. Whenever encountering technical difficulties inthe login or uploading process, participants assisted each other. This situation occurredfrequently in the first week in both schools. However, students in College Aconfronted fewer technical problems in class, so the need for cooperation decreased inthe following two weeks. Similarly, students in College B were willing to help eachother solve the technical problems.The third category in Table 5 shows that students in College B had more negativeattitudes towards the activity at the beginning; however, the severity of their negativefeelings decreased by the third week. The frequency of interaction among participantsis widely acknowledged to be an indicator of successful online learning experiences.At the beginning, unfamiliarity with platform operation resulted in low frequency ofblog responses in both schools. Not many students in College B gave feedback onblogs since they were less familiar with the U-HELP. The interactions between the twoschools improved in the second week, but in the third week the feedback given to thestudents in College A diminished again. This phenomenon probably resulted from theparticipants’ lack of interest or motivation, and it can also be attributed to theparticipants’ negative attitudes towards the entire procedure.In spite of the participants’ negative attitudes in class, a substantial number of theparticipants had good engagement in positive reactions toward the tasks. In the firstweek, students in College A were enthusiastic about the opportunity to partake inonline activities with students from the other school, and seemed to be more excitedabout these activities than students in College B. In class observation showed studentsin College B followed the instructions and seemed well engaged in the online activitiesin spite of the low frequencies of their blog replies. As they became more familiar withU-HELP, students in College B showed a greater level of engagement in the activities.As for the students in College A, they engaged in the tasks most during the secondweek, but their enthusiasm declined in the third week due to a lack of responses fromCollege B.The features of the offline interaction echo the findings of the first research question.Collaboration and engagement were found in both online and offline settings.However, students encountered problems of networking systems and suffered fromthe tense atmosphere in the classroom, which might partially explain why theyneglected the learning process such as planning and reflecting. Although moresophisticated research should be designed addressing the relationship between onlineand offline interaction in blended learning, we can infer that offline interaction such asthe classroom atmosphere and the participants’ affective factors could influence theenhancement of reflective process claimed by ACMC (An & Frick, 2006) and thesustainability of motivation toward online interaction to a certain extent. In addition,\n842 Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 2010, 26(6)how to promote students’ intrinsic motivation toward the asynchronouscommunication is an area worth more research.Conclusions and implicationsThe characteristics associated with online collaborative communication and offlineinteraction are identified in the present study. However, the proportions ofcharacteristics are different from previous studies. In addition to social interaction andtask-oriented interaction, students in this study did not pay much attention toplanning the group discussion, seek input, and monitor/reflect on the process. Withregard to group dynamic, students from College A posted more frequently thanstudents from College B did, but a wide range in the frequency of interaction acrossthe 12 groups was found in this study. In class observation revealed the tenseatmosphere and problems related to handling the activity in offline interactions. Theoffline interactions in carrying out the ACMC activities in the classrooms were sortedinto five major categories: struggling with platform operation, handling technicalproblems, passive attitudes towards the procedure, tense atmosphere in class, andengagement in tasks.Compared to a traditional instructional model, the implementation of ICT tools inblended learning does promote social interaction among students and theirengagement and thus a more learner-centered learning environment was created bymeans of integrating e-learning elements. However, it does not automatically facilitatestudents in their adoption of active learning strategies. The roles group members oughtto play should be recognised to promote effective and efficient online/offlineinteraction. Moreover, the problematic aspects of networked learning result in negativeattitudes of students in offline interaction in class, which may in turn incur insufficientonline interaction and impair students’ learning.Based on the findings, some pedagogical implications are presented. For effectiveinteraction in both online and offline settings, instructors should take account ofstudents’ characteristics and their technical and learning competencies. As Donnellyand McSweeney (2008) suggest, instructors should trigger students into theemployment of e-tools for formal learning activities and provide them with requiredsupport to master the competencies governing effective and collaborative onlinelearning. Moreover, teachers who devote themselves to e-learning from socioculturalperspectives should take care of pedagogical techniques such as carefully groupingstudents and constantly guiding students for effective interaction (Kitade, 2008; Pawanet al., 2003).Key competencies such as how to work electronically within a group and how toharness ICT tools should be instructed, especially for students accustoming totraditional learning methods. Specifically, reflective practice for a person to usereflective processes to critically analyse, reappraise, and learn from experiences(Bulman & Schutz, 2004; Redmond, 2004) should be advocated, to help students adoptvirtual learning methods, work collaboratively online, and maximise learningoutcomes. By so doing, students may increase their metacognitive awareness of thelearning process and strategise ways to achieve the pedagogical goals of the tasksassigned (in this case, hospitality culture exchange and language learning) instead ofthe epiphenomena arising in the process of task completion (Belz, 2002).\nWang 843To promote the success of blended learning, the social interdependence among theparticipants, the tasks assigned, and the e-learning tools remain challenging forteachers. For future research, a longitudinal study, as suggested by Farmer, Yue andBrooks (2008) who used blogging for higher order learning, could be designed tomonitor students’ use of online communication patterns and evaluate the impact of theadoption of technology on classroom interaction. In addition, classroom interactioncould be recorded for more accurate data analyses to reveal how offline interactioninfluences online learning. Moreover, empirical study with pre- and post-tests could bedesigned to investigate the extent to which learners retain the co-constructedknowledge and also the extent to which e-learning application with different tasksfacilitates language learning. Finally, as one reviewer pointed out, the onlineinteractions in this study took place mainly within groups rather than between groupsand this phenomenon could result from the mandatory requirement to discuss withtheir group mates and the optional requirement to discuss with other groups. Furtherresearch can be conducted to examine how the online tasks should be designed toexcite students’ interests in online discussion and in turn arouse their intrinsicmotivation to benefit from blended learning.AcknowledgmentsAn earlier version of this paper was presented at the conference, The FirstInternational Conference on Popular Culture and Education in Asia, held at the HongKong Institute of Education by the support of National Science Council (NSC 97-2914-I-328-002-A1).
