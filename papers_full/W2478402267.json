Introduction\nPowder-binder-jetting (PBJ)\n technology, an important process within the additive manufac‐\nturing (AM) technology, may be considered as the standard method for the production of cores\nand molds for the foundry industry. Despite the enormous turnover volumes, the characteris‐\ntic variables of the process and the process chain for metal casting are still relatively un‐\nknown. This chapter lists the main processes involved in this technology and provides extensive,\napplication-relevant measurement values and results for foundry processes. Thus, the foun‐\ndry world and the world of additive manufacturing (AM) are closely interlinked.\n© 2016 The Author(s). Licensee InTech.

The production\nis directly related to the component data. In the case of the conventional manufacturing, the\ncomponent data are at first realized as a model or tool, and this part is then further used for\nthe actual production. The time required for an entire processing cycle is significantly reduced\nby applying additive manufacturing methods (see [1]).\nThis layer-based powder-binder-jetting technology produces porous material components by\nselective bonding of particle material. These characteristics (specifically strength) are disad‐\nvantageous for the direct use, but parts manufactured in this manner can be used in the foundry\nprocess. A temperature-resistant material, such as sand, is used as particle material for this\nprocess. The binder is also selected in accordance to its properties and temperature resistance\nproperties are adjusted. Due to the porosity of the parts, the resulting gas can escape during\ncasting, which eliminates casting defects by rising gas bubbles in the melt.\nThe particular process associated with powder-binder-jetting which makes this process highly\nefficient is the use of particle material as a basis and the use of a limited amount of binder. In\naddition, the automation process can easily be expanded. It is possible to produce component\nsizes that are specific for foundry technology. Scalability during production allows production\nrates that are economical for small series. Here as well, a lot of potential can be seen, and\npreviously limited lot sizes increasingly move toward larger lot sizes (see [2]).\nThis chapter introduces the powder-binder-jetting method in detail and explains its suitability\nfor the production of molds. Other additive manufacturing processes are briefly described and\ntheir different characteristics are shown. It is shown that powder-binder-jetting processes\nbased on lot sizes and productivity are unique, and therefore hold a prominent position as an\nindustrial means of production within AM.\nThe sand casting process plays an important role in the field of conventional casting technol‐\nogy. This sand casting process is carried out using three materials/binding systems, which can\nbe directly transferred to AM production methods. The basic methodology of determining the\ncharacterizing parameters are explained further in the following sections. The data obtained\nfor printed components using this method are compared with the data of conventionally\nmanufactured components and an assessment is carried out.\nA subchapter deals with the application of 3D printed molds for metal casting in the area of\ncold-curing materials. Here, the problems arising out of de-coring are most crucial. The process\nof extracting the printed part from the mold is explained in detail using the examples of\nconcrete casting. The results that are obtained in this area are presented in detail and discussed\nin the context of applications in structural engineering and architecture.\nAnother section presents the use of the particle material, PMMA powder, as a basis for the\ninvestment casting process. Here, the investment casting process is explained and its embodi‐\nment as AM process is explained using 3D-printed forms. Within this context as well, the\nproperty requirement necessary for the 3D-printed parts is also elaborated.\nNew Trends in 3D Printing54\n2. Powder-binder-jetting\n2.1. Overview\nThis section provides \nan overview of the powder-binding-jetting technology. As in the case of\nseveral additive manufacturing processes, this process too comprises individual steps that are\nrepeated continuously to form a three-dimensional component. Figure 1 provides an over‐\nview.\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the powder-binder-jetting-process: (a) lowering the build platform, (b) layering\nwith particle material, and (c) printing process using binder.\nThe PBJ process steps are as follows: applying a layer of particle material (powder) on a build\nplatform, bonding of \nthe powder particles by a liquid, and lowering the build platform by the\nheight of the desired layer thickness (see [3]).\nThe process begins with an empty build platform. It is usually set up within a build box. A\nseal prevents leakage of powder between the moving construction platform and the static walls\nof the build box. The recoater spreads the powder on the build platform (see [4]). The powder\ncan either be placed in front of the recoater or is moved along with the recoater across the build\nplatform.\nAt the start of the construction process, the space between the recoater blade and the build\nplatform is sequentially built up with multiple layers of powder to eventually form an even\nlayer of powder.\nIn the next step, the inkjet print head moves over the powder layer and doses binder onto the\nlayer. The current height of the built component corresponds to a cross-section of the virtual\ncomponent. The inside part of the cross-section is filled up by print data. Depending on the\ndata processing process, the sliced images are eventually converted into a matrix, in this case\nin a bitmap structure (for data formats, see [5]).\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n55\nThe inkjet print head also represents a matrix-like arrangement and is guided across the entire\nbuilt platform, depending \non the size of the print head in a meandering motion or in one linear\ndrive across the platform. In the simplest case, this matrix-like arrangement is a line of nozzles\nwhich correspond to the driving pattern as determined by the data matrix. During the drive,\ndata change in rapid succession, thus forming the desired image.\nThe droplets are generated in the inkjet print head itself due to rapid pressure fluctuations and\nexpelled through a micronozzle. Thus, a drop formed in the micronozzle is pressed out and\nleaves the nozzle as a free-flying independent droplet. Due to this process, certain restrictions\nare placed on the material range that can be applied (see [6, 7]).\nThe upper limit for the viscosity is currently approximately 30 mPa s. The surface tension\nshould be substantially below that of water, so less than 50 mN/m. The printable material can\ninclude solvents, aqueous solutions, oils, or monomers. The media should not expel particles\nlarger than approximately 1 µm so that no blockages are formed in the microjets.\nThe final step in the construction process is the lowering of the build platform. After lowering,\nthe resultant space is again filled with the help of the recoater. The layer thickness corresponds\nto the vertical distance the build platform moved while lowering. An alternative process is the\ncontinuous 3D printer. According to this method, the printing is performed on an inclined\nplane and the powder-bed movement takes place via a conveyor belt at an angle to the plane\n(see [8]).\n2.2. Distinction from other processes\nThe MultiJet modeling process works similar to the PBJ process. The focus of the method is\nalso an inkjet print head that works on matrix basis. Contrary to the method described above,\npowder is not used, but the desired shape is composed by the medium expelled from the print\nhead. Here, the medium is cured in layers with the help of a UV source. Overhangs can be\nachieved by using a support medium that is applied over a second print head. Curing is done\nusing UV technology (see [9]).\nUnder the vector-based methods, the fused deposition modeling is the only method that is not\nbased on energy beam technology and is thus similar to the PBJ process. As opposed to the\ntwo procedures mentioned above, this method does not involve free-flying droplets. The\nmodel is constructed using an extruded filament (see [9]).\nIn the beam-based method, there is no additional mass involved during construction process,\nreflecting the total mass of the finished model. Existing volume is modified. During\nstereolithography, resin is cured by a laser beam [10]. When laser sintering process is applied,\na powder is used as a base which is similar to the PBJ process and a high-energy beam is used\nto fuse the powder; Currently, the most widely used methods are the ones making plastic or\nmetal parts. Materials such as ceramics, concrete, or biological materials are the subject of\nresearch on an industrial scale but not yet main stream (for ceramic see [11]). Table 1 provides\ninformation on the different distinction possibilities.\nNew Trends in 3D Printing56\nMethod FDM LS SLA PBJ\nVector based X X X\nMatrix based X\nPowder based X X\nBeam based X X\nSize ++ 0 + ++\nPerformance 0 + + ++\nCosts ++ 0 0 ++\nDirect application ++ ++ + 0\nMaterial diversity + + 0 ++\nTable 1. Characteristics and categorizations of various AM methods.\n2.3. Scalability\nAmong all processes, the powder-binder-jetting process is considered the most scalable. This\nhas an impact \non possible component sizes and system performance. Different categories of\nscalability are discussed and evaluated as below.\nIn the PBJ process, the build size is defined by the distances covered by the linear axes. In\nprinciple, these axes can be extended as required. Merely the axle supporting structure needs\nto be adjusted according to the increased point of deflection. Limitations are generally not\nposed by the device, but by the strength of the product produced relative to its weight. This\nratio largely determines the handling of the parts and is therefore size restricted.\nThe performance of a system is often quantified on the basis of the time taken to print one\nlayer.\nDuring the PBJ process, the pixels of a layer are printed by individual parallel controllable\nnozzles. Here, the number of the nozzles is proportional to the print performance. When\nmeasures are taken to parallelize the coating process, the number of nozzles is often nearly\nproportional to the time per layer. The performance of the printing system can thus be easily\nscaled by increasing the number of nozzles.\nWithin PBJ process, there is another option to improve the performance: Several spatially\nsuccessively arranged coating and printing units are able to generate quasiparallel layers. The\napplicable layer time is then the layer time of such a “layer unit” divided by the number of the\nactive “layer units” [12].\nFor procedures having a vector control, such scales cannot be realized. In laser-based methods,\nthe radiation field cannot be expanded indefinitely. This is mainly due to the flat field lens\nrequired for a focused exposure. Similarly, it is not possible to use arbitrarily many laser\nsources simultaneously since the beam path would rapidly become complicated, particularly\ndue to the necessary deviation.\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n57\nIn the case of FDM, axis scaling is possible as which the PBJ processes. However, due to the\nmass inertia of \nthe print-head discharge, speeds are limited. A parallelization of several print-\nhead discharges is possible albeit only with considerable effort.\nThe parallelization described by several “layer units” is not possible in the laser sintering\nprocess and the SLA process. Both methods use contour procedures that require a complete\n“visibility” of the current layer. A parallelization would require at least the simultaneous\nformation of a new layer and the laser exposure of an old layer. The FDM method combines\nthe shaping and layer formation. In this case, this principle can also not be used.\nThe PBJ method thus provides unique opportunities to improve performance. A summary of\nthese bearings can be found in Table 2. Thus, applying this technology as a production process\nwithin established production procedures seems to be realizable.\nProcess Size   Layer speed Z-speed\nPBJ ++ ++ ++\nFDM ++ 0 -\nSLS - + +\nSLA 0 + -\nTable 2. Assessment of the scalability of different processes.\n2.4. Basic modeling\nThe mechanical properties \nof the PBJ processes are, apart from the cohesion of the binder and\nthe adhesion of the binder to the particles, essentially determined by two variables: the grain\nsize and the relative amount of binder. During the model forming process, the particles are\nthought to be stronger than the bond.\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of the model particles/bond: (a) illustration of a particle cluster under tension, (b)\nillustration of two particles under tension, and (c) highly simplified model for calculating the volume of the bond.\nNew Trends in 3D Printing58\nA model of the bond can be represented as in the following simplified diagram: Between two\nparticles that are \nconsidered as ideal for the spherical model, there exists an external nearly\ncylindrical binder bridge (see Figure 2). This bridge is formed by capillary action shortly after\napplication of the binder by the print head and the respective strengthening mechanism freezes\nthis condition. This form of connection is similar to the sintering process. Basic deviations,\nnecessary for the basic understanding of the conditions, can be obtained by simple consider‐\nations.\nIf the binder bridge is small in relation to the radius of the sphere (h = const), then considering\nthe above assumptions, a model of a cylinder minus two cones describes\n2 2 2 3 FlV a h p= × × × × (1)\nthe volume of the bond or the printed quantity of liquid. If the model is modified to determine\nthe influence of \nthe volume, it can be assumed that a constant distance of the particles exists.\nOnly the radius of the cylinder varies. Thus, the relation holds true:\n2 ~ . FlV a (2)\nThe contact area A and the maximum mechanical tension σMax are accessible via simple\nequations\n2 a nd ~ . MaxA a A p s= × (3)\nThe relationship of the printed amount to the mechanical stress at break is thus linear:\n~ . Max Fl Vs (4)\nThe strength is thus linearly dependent on the volume of the printed material. The printed\nvolume corresponds to \nthe organic or inorganic binder content minus the evaporated solvent\ncontent.\nConsidering the influence of the particle size, the model must be mentally expanded to form\na particle cluster. As a minimal model, a cubic packing may be used and a voxel as observa‐\ntional volume. A voxel is defined by the smallest possible volume that can be produced with\na PBJ system. The dimensions of a voxel are made up of layer thickness and the resolution of\nthe inkjet print head together in two directions. For the number of binding areas per voxel N\nholds true:\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n59\n3 \n6 6 V\nP\np\nlN N D\næ ö\n= × = × ç ÷ç ÷è ø\n(5)\nwith the number of particles per voxel Np, the dimension lp, a cubic voxel, and the grain\ndiameter Dp of the considered perfect monomodal particle size distribution.\nFor the volume of a single bond VB and the total binder volume per voxel Vv, the following\nequation applies:\n3 \n6 .

This implies that the use of finer particles leads to a reduction of strength.\nSimilarly, when particle size is reduced (improving the surface properties), the amount of\nNew Trends in 3D Printing60\nliquid printed needs to be adjusted. In the given model assumptions, the density is not affected\nby changes in the particle diameter.\nFigure 3. Diagram of the pore-channel diameter at different particle diameters: (a) diameter of an average particle clus‐\nter with inscribed minimum passage diameter and (b) particle cluster with half a particle diameter for comparison.\nThe dimension of the size of the pores is changed by changing the particle diameter (see Figure\n3). In this \nexample, the diameter of the respective largest circular diameter DPor is inversely\nproportionate to the particle diameter. This can be roughly described as\n1 ~ . Por\nP\nD D (11)\nAccording to this relationship, the resistance of a gas flowing through such channels greatly\nincreases because the \nvolume flow is proportional to the diameter to the fourth power. A\nchange in the particle diameter (for example to influence surface finish) has a strong influence\non the behavior of the gas penetration in the printed model.\n3. Production of casts by powder-binder-jetting\n3.1. Theory, chemical, and physical basics\nThe introduction describes the conventional process—to produce metal parts by casting. Sand\ncasting or the combined use of molds and sand cores is explained as follows.\nCasting provides important components for industrial production because they provide high\nfunctional integration densities with cost-effective implementation. The production of castings\nis carried out in two steps: First, to create a multipart mold having a cavity which corresponds\nsubstantially to the later casting. Second, the casting where the mold is filled with molten metal\nand after its solidification forms the actual part.\nDepending on the complexity, quantity, or cost requirements, the mold can be designed as a\ndisposable or reusable form. Simple structures can be produced using reusable forms.\nComplex shaped channels in the casting are only possible using disposable molds to realize\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n61\nsuch complex cores. Often the techniques are hybridized with each other to take advantage of\nthe required assembly (see [13]).\nThus, the cavity \nof a casting for metallic molds, and molds and cores, may be surrounded by\nsand. These different parts are mounted before they are cast, some with a large degree of\nautomation (for process steps, see Figure 4).\nDisposable molds and cores are made from a base molding material that is a particle material\nusing a binder. The binder is often a fluid, which is mixed with the particle material. This\nmixture is then added to the model and solidifies. The model is shaped in such a way that the\nmodel or the core can be removed from the model without being destroyed. Thus, high\ncomplexities cannot be achieved using this method. More complex mold sets have to be\nassembled from individual parts by mounting (see [14]).\nFigure 4. Diagram of the conventional sand casting process: (a) model, (b) preparation of the molding material mix‐\nture, (c) molding of the model and solidification of the molding material mixture, (d) part of mold (drag), (e) mounting\nof molds and cores, (f) pouring liquid metal, (g) solidification and weakening of molding material, (h) extraction, and\n(i) casting with gating.\nFor the production of series, the molding material is often mixed with the binder and activated\nin an automated \nprocess (Figure 4). This reactive mixture is then injected via a pneumatic\nconveyer into a model form and gets coated alongside the walls. The component thus produced\nis cured in the model form. After curing, the part is often automatically removed by a robot\nand is deburred by an automated process as well. Thereafter, the mold for the actual casting\nprocess is again mounted with the help of the robot. The casting process too can thus be carried\nout fully automated.\nThe method described requires several basic materials properties for the individual process\nsteps. The particle material must be free flowing to fill the model form. The binder must have\nNew Trends in 3D Printing62\nvery low viscosity for metering and for the resulting molding material flow characteristics\n(Figure 5 ).\nBoth properties are \nalso a basis for processing of materials in machines within the PBJ process.\nTherefore, the materials can be used in 3D printers without major modifications in their\nphysical or chemical properties.\nBoth methods can also be combined. Forms created with conventional tools or molds are able\nto support PBJ-printed cores (compare [15] or [16]).\nThe heat occurring during casting is used to weaken the molds and cores to such an extent that\nafter solidification of the casting the molding material can easily be removed from the casting.\nThis is called de-coring and is significantly defined by the binder.\nAmong the additive manufacturing methods, the laser-sintering process is the only other AM\nmethod by which it is possible to create cores and molds for the foundry industry. In this\nmethod, resin-coated sand is melted with a laser and thus selectively bound. The technique is\nsimilar to the Croning® method (see [17]).\nFigure 5. Brief overview of highly automated core production: (a) half section of a core model, (b) preparation of the\nmolding material mixture, (c) core shooting process, (d) inserting the core in the mold, (e) casting process, (f) removal\nof the casting with the core (gating is not shown), (g) clamping the casting, (h) shake-out of the core, and (i) casting.\nMetals that can be used in the sand casting process, in certain cases, exhibit very different\nproperties (see Table 3). As far \nas weight goes, cast iron is the most widely used material for\ncasting. It is characterized by a low melting point of about 1250°C and excellent mold filling\nproperties. Less common casting is the use of steel whose melting point is about 1700°C. Here,\nform filling is much more difficult. Due to the ready availability of a variety of cast iron types\nhaving high ductility, the ductility of the material is only a weak criterion for choosing the\nappropriate casting material. Therefore, cast steel has become less important. Aluminum is\nsuperior due to the lightweight requirements of modern products and has thus become\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n63\nincreasingly popular. Aluminum–silicon alloys are excellent for mold filling and melt at\naround 700°C. In \nsand casting processes, there are plenty of other metals that can be used.\nThese include the nonferrous metals such as copper, brass, and bronze. Similarly, other light\nmetals or alloys can also be used, for example magnesium (see [18]).\nAluminum Cast iron Steel\nStrength 0 + ++\nElongation at break 0 0 ++\nDamping 0 + −\nCorrosion behavior + − −\nMachining + + 0\nDensity ~3 ~6.5 ~7\nMarket importance + 0 −\nTable 3. The most important metals in the foundry industry.\n3.1.1. Sand and particle material\nParticle material is \nthe basis of the powder-binder-jetting process. Therefore, the properties of\nthe particles and the particle clusters are of particular importance and are described below (see\nFigure 6).\nFigure 6. Methods for the characterization of particulate matter: (a) angle of repose and density determination, (b) mi‐\ncroscopy, (c) pH value determination, and (d) particle size analysis.\nDifferent groups of sand types are available for sand casting processes. The natural sands are\ncharacterized by low \ncost. The main group forms the quartz sand whose purity permits\npredictable behavior in the casting. The contents of SiO2 often exceed 95% in weight. The other\nNew Trends in 3D Printing64\ncomponents are usually also oxidic in nature such as Al 2O3 or MgO. Since the sand prior to\nuse is strongly heated in order to dry, organic admixtures are usually excluded.\nFor special applications, there are also natural sands which are a mixture of Al 2O3 and SiO2.\nHere, the costs are not as low as with pure quartz sands. Other minerals, for example chrome\nore or zircon sands, are common when a high density of the molds or cores is required (see [19]).\nArtificial sands, although substantially more expensive, are also common. Here, mostly\nAl2O3 or SiO 2 are used as the base. These sands are chemically highly pure and the particle\nspectrum is precisely adapted to the requirement (see [20]).\nIn the case of natural sands, the grain structure depends on the origin of the sands. Cracked\nproducts are made up of sharp-edged grains that are generally more square shaped than\nspherical in shape. Sand qualities can be obtained from natural deposits such as rivers, whose\nparticle shape is nearly spherical. These sands also often exhibit particularly favorable\nmicrotopology for binding reactions (see [20] and Figure 7).\nDepending on the production process, the form of artificial sand is usually spherical. This\nproperty allows these products to flow very well and there are smooth surfaces.\nFigure 7. Various mold raw materials: (a) SEM picture of natural sand and (b) optical microscopy artificial molding\nmaterial.\nThe sand particles react with various chemicals. Many oxides react alkaline in an aqueous\nenvironment. Therefore, the \npH value of the applied media changes, which is especially\nsignificant for PBJ processes when the sand is premixed with a liquid.\nA measurement of the chemical properties can be carried out by measuring the pH of the wash\nsolution for the sand. For example, for an amount of water of 100 g, 10 g sand is given and\nafter a waiting period of 10 min the pH value is determined with a pH meter with a glass\nelectrode or is determined titrimetrically against an alkaline solution.\nNatural sands have a significantly broad particle size distribution. Here, often a noticeable\namount of fine particle distribution of up to <10 µm particle size can be noticed. This affects\nvarious properties, among other things, the flow property, but also the bond because the\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n65\nmicrograins attract the binder in a capillary manner and thus withdraws from the binding\nregion of the mold-forming grains (find different qualities in Table 4).\nUndesirably large grains \nare often separated by sieving. This leads to a sharp divide in the\ngrain size range. The bulk density of the sieved as well as unsifted materials falls way behind\ntheoretical possibilities. With natural sand, about 50% volume space filling can be achieved.\nTargeted blends can positively affect the bulk density (see [21]).\nArtificial sands are nearly monodisperse, i.e., they have essentially only one grain size. This\nproperty and the round grain often lead to an increased bulk density. Again, this effect can be\nenhanced by adding further monodisperse powders having different grain size.\nNatural sands are often preferred because of their low cost. However, especially with quartz\nsands, a change in the crystal structure of the elementary cell (quartz inversion) takes place at\na temperature of 573°C. These stretches abruptly produce a sudden increase in volume of the\ncore or mold. This often leads to flaking of layers close to the mold cavity, thus causing casting\ndefects (see [14]).\nFor artificial sands, this effect is usually only minimal. Here, additionally a high density is\noften implemented in order to reduce the buoyancy of cores in the melt.\nIn the PBJ process, much finer sands are used compared with sands used in the standard\nfoundry. This is necessary in order to achieve surface qualities that are comparable to the\nconventional process because the grains are not aligned toward the surface of the component\nas is the case while using a model.\nQuartz sand GS14RP Cera beads AFS100 Kerphalite HA\nChemical base SiO2 Al2O3/SiO2 Al2O3/SiO2\nPurity/contents (%) >98 62/38 60/40\nMedium grain size (µm) 140 150 200\nSpecific surface (cm2/g) 176 172 105\nSinter temperature (°C) >1550 >1660 >1660\nResidual water content (%) 0.2 0.7 0.7\npH of washing solution 6.3 6.7 6.4\n* the shown figures are simplified and do not take account of the small amount of additional oxides.\nTable 4. Examples of data for sand systems which are suitable for the PBJ process.\n3.1.2. Binder systems\nThe bonding strength \nbetween particles is caused by the binder. In the case of PBJ, the binder\nis selectively applied with the help of an inkjet print head.\nNew Trends in 3D Printing66\nFigure 8. Basic binding mechanisms: (a) solidification by evaporation of solvent and (b) curing by polymerization.\nBasically, two binding mechanisms can be used for the above-mentioned PBJ process (as\ndepicted in Figure 8).\nThe material may \nbe dissolved in liquid binder. The adhesive effect of the material is obtained\nby drying. Often plastics or inorganic binders are dissolved in water or suitable solvents. The\ndrying must take place as long as the layer is exposed and the parts lie covered in powder\nduring the construction process. A variation on this procedure is to dissolve the particle\nmaterial with the help of a solvent which is part of the printing liquid and then to let it dry\nagain. Thus, a binder-free medium can be printed. This is favorable for the life of the print\nhead. But the problem is often the long setting time.\nPolymerizing binders can also be used. Polymerization is a chemical reaction where mostly\nlow molecular weight substances react in longer chains of molecules. Thus, a transition\nbetween low viscosities, i.e., good printability and extremely high viscosities (solid), is made\npossible.\nUsually, it is not only necessary but also useful to use both methods as a hybrid. This allows\nmoderate reaction rates that safeguard all the machine components and support a drying\nprocess deep inside the large powder cake.\nThe properties of the binder which are suitable for the PBJ methods are very similar to those\nof the conventional molding production. In the following, the most common systems are\ndescribed according to their chemical and physical characteristics (Table 5).\nFuran resin is a polymer binder which is derived from corn cobs. The resin system is available\nin the form of a resin and an activator component. The resin itself is made up of monomers\nand oligomers, for example, furfuryl alcohol, bisphenol A, and resorcinol. In addition,\nadhesion promoters are included. The activator is an acid, usually a mixture of several acids.\nIt has a catalytic effect on the reaction, but is itself also consumed in the process. The polymer\nwith is produced through polycondensation is a cross-linked, high-strength thermoset which\nis highly temperature resistant due to furan groups in the molecule (see [14]).\nIn contrast to furan resins, phenol resins consist of phenol units, which are preferably linked\nto each other in para and/or ortho-positions via methylene groups. No continuous conjugated\nsystem is formed. The curing process is carried out using formaldehyde depending on the\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n67\nprepolymer. For example this can be made available for the process by the thermal decompo‐\nsition of the \nsubstance Urotropin. A thermoset plastic is again formed. The temperature\nresistance is even higher than that of furan resin (see [14]).\nInorganic binders are gaining importance not only because of their historical importance, but\nalso because of new requirements for environmental-friendly production. They are character‐\nized by very low and harmless cast emissions. For this process, liquid water glass is of\nparticular importance. It can achieve high strengths. However, the de-coring process after\ncasting requires more effort with this binder system than with the organically bound varieties\n(see [14]).\nFuranic resin Phenolic resin Inorganics\nBending strength (N/cm2) 250* 350* 300*\nTemp. stability Sufficient Very stable Extremely stable\nDe-coring ++ + −\nShelf life (months) 12 6 Unlimited\nEmissions High High No\nTable 5. Relevant binder systems and properties, *typical figures, depending on the amount of binder.\n3.2. Methods for the characterization of PBJ generated parts for foundry purposes\nUsing PBJ printed \ncomponents as tools for casting processes requires a special range of\ncharacteristics for the parts. The porosity of the parts is essential for the process. Similarly, the\nstrength values are important to ensure safe handling, as well as safe and easy de-coring after\ncasting. In this process, some values are linked and, under certain circumstances, represent\ncontradictory optimization criteria (Figure 9).\nFigure 9. Schema of interdependent properties.\nNew Trends in 3D Printing68\nThe resulting amount of gas emitted from the burning binder during casting must be diverted\nthrough the porous \nstructure of the molds and cores. The volume of the gas impact will depend\non the proportion of the binder. This in turn significantly affects the strength. The strength is\ndependent upon the particle size, the related resolution, and the achievable surface quality of\nthe process in relation to the geometry. Similarly, high strength often means the tendency for\nshrinkage and thus distortion. The geometry works once again due to the effect of the grain\nsize on gas permeability, as the finer particles cause the gas channels to become narrow.\nFigure 10. (a) Diagram showing the arrangement to determine gas permeability and (b) process cycle during the deter‐\nmination of ignition loss: (i) taring process, (ii) (initial) weighing material, (iii) glowing, and (iv) weighing material.\nThe range of printed applications as well as conventionally manufactured cores and molds is\naffected by gas \npermeability. To determine the behavior of the gas, the flow rate can be\nmeasured with the help of a test specimen at a given pressure. In this case, a tester of the type\nSPDU of + GF + is used. A cylinder having dimensions 50 mm × 50 mm is used as test specimen\n(for schematic, see Figure 10a).\nThe second important parameter characterizing the moldings with respect to the gas problem\nis the loss on ignition. This is determined by taking a sample from a bound form or a core. A\nfurnace of type KLS 05/11 from Thermconcept and scales of the type of PCB2500-2 core were\nused in the above-described experiment.\nAccording to the standard method for determining the loss on ignition, about 30 g pulverized\nmolding, usually from test bars, is weighed and put into a ceramic bowl. Before the bowl is\nfilled, it is constantly heated to constant weight in an oven to extract moisture and organic\nresidues. Before and after filling, the bowl is weighed. The binder or moisture in the compo‐\nnents is burned out or expelled at about 900°C for approximately 30 minutes. After cooling,\nthe weight is determined again. The difference between the weight of sand sample before and\nafter heating is the absolute loss on ignition which is usually expressed in percent by weight\non the initial weight (see Figure 10b).\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n69\nFigure 11. (a) Detecting the main dimensions with a vernier height gauge and (b) basic determination of triangulation.\nThe accuracy of the construction method is determined based on test specimens. These\ndetermine the scope \nof the machine. Rods measuring up to 500 mm can be measured in this\nmanner. The simplest and most common method is the direct measuring with a caliper or\nvernier height gauge. More complex shapes can be determined using optical methods. Some\nof them are based on the principle of triangulation. Here, a device of the type MICRO-\nOPTRONIC optoNCDT is used (ref. overview [22]) (see Figure 11).\nThe surface parameters of the molds and cores are determined by a tactile measuring method.\nHere, the extreme microstructure and the weak binding of the grains are taken into account\nso that an imprint of the surface is made before measurements are carried out (Figure 12a).\nFor the purpose of forming an imprint, plasticine may be used as a quick means yielding good\naccuracy. Plasticine is soft and produces a clean and accurate imprint. The impression thus\nobtained is cured at 100°C in the oven. The imprint is then scanned with a surface measuring\ndevice, i.e., type Mahr MarSurf SD 26. The evaluation of the values Ra and Rz is calculated\nautomatically (Figure 12b).\nFigure 12. (a) Creating an imprint of the surface and (b) determination of the surface finish using a tactile device.\nNew Trends in 3D Printing70\nThe strength of 3D printed parts is determined using destructive testing just as in conventional\nproduction methods. Conventional test equipment is used. A universal type ZMART.PRO of\nthe company Zwick \nis used for the determination of the E modulus, the elongation at break,\nand the tensile strength. For a three-point bend test which is commonly used in the foundry\nindustry, a test device of the type +GF+ PFO is used.\nA test job is specifically built having the appropriate material system for recording the\nmeasured values. This includes all relevant tests specimens in different variations for the\ndescribed tests. The material system furan is processed on a Prometal S15 system. The phenolic\nresin and inorganic binding material are processed on a voxeljet VX1000. Figure 13 represents\na test job on a VX1000.\nFigure 13. Arrangement of different test samples within a test job.\n3.3. Results for PBJ printed parts\nWithin PBJ, the \nfuran resin system is the most common and long-term proven system. The\nmeasured values refer to a system with the sand type GS 14 RP Strobel quartz sand. As sand\nbinder, a binder from ASK type ASKURAN with the corresponding hardener is used.\nThe test samples show a strength with an average of 270 N/cm2 at a density of 1.35 g/cm2. The\nscattering of 20% within an orientation can be measured. The maximum anisotropy of the\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n71\nstrength values is shown in a deviation of nearly 40% in strength for bending-test samples built\nin the Z-direction (see Table 6).\nOrientation X Y Z\nMin.

Properties of PBJ-printed parts using different binder systems.\n3.4. Discussion\nThe special characteristics \nof the printed components relative to the conventionally manufac‐\ntured components are the smaller grain size, the alignment of the grains, and built-layer\ncharacteristics unique to each method. Thus, the 3D printing itself exhibits different values. At\na comparable grain size, the surface finish of 3D printed parts is substantially lower compared\nwith that of the conventional parts. Similarly, the loss on ignition is higher at the same strength,\nas the conventional methods have a greater densing effect on the material.\nThe methodology for measuring the properties can be well transferred to the PBJ process. But\nthere are special considerations to be observed. Most dimensions are anisotropic. Additionally,\nthe artifacts “stair steps” have to be considered for an objective surface quality comparison\nand each surface orientation has a different surface finish.\nThe use of 3D printed cores is by now widely spread. Even complex cores can be produced by\nthis method with a suitable choice of the binder system, although some characteristics of the\nconventional production may not be achievable. To produce challenging cores, it is possible\nto find good compromises for test series. The material systems described above provide such\nprocesses, material and binder combinations.\n4. Forms and cores for cold setting materials\nIn addition to metal casting, several important casting processes exist for the production of\nmolds. For example, thermoplastic resins are injected into molds under high pressure.\nCommodities thermosets usually have very low viscosity and can be poured just like liquid\nmetals. Casting of concrete is also relevant. Here, large volumes and tonnage can be cast. These\nmolds can be built as forms and also be constructed using PBJ-printing technology (see [23]).\nIn concrete casting, carpenters are often involved in preparing the formwork. The castings are\nmostly simple geometries. Pillars, walls, and ceilings are predominately made by this casting\nprocess. But more complex forms such as curved stairways are poured into wooden molds\n(see Figure 14 and compare [24]).\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n73\nIn prototyping, even large components are cast with reactive resins. Here as well, large molds\nare necessary to \ngive the casting the correct geometry. The casting process is essentially\nanalogous to the conventional concrete pouring.\nFigure 14. (a) Conventional procedure in construction: (i) pouring concrete into formwork, (ii) finished de-cored wall\nand (b) construction made by a carpenter: curved wall structure.\nConcrete casting usually consist of smooth walls, which can be used repeatedly, and hand-\ncrafted wooden construction, \nwhich is often used only for one part. After the mold is set up,\nthe reinforcement is usually built from iron. Then, the previously mixed concrete is poured.\nAfter curing, the formwork is cut off and the concrete can be surface treated.\nIn concrete construction high complexity is seldom realized due to the formwork technology.\nIn contrast to metal casting, the heat of the cast material cannot be used for de-molding.\nA high degree of complexity can be achieved with printed forms. Molds may be used once or\nseveral times depending on their geometries, for example, whether forms have undercuts or\nnot is a relevant criterion.\nThe printed forms have to be surface treated irrespective of the base material used ( Figure\n15). There are two essential points that need to be considered. Firstly, it is important to prevent\ncement from entering the pore space of the mold. This would also lead to the mold sticking to\nthe form and to cement leaking around the peripheral regions. Both these factors mean that\nthe outer surface of the casting will be damaged.\nSecondly, the separation of casting and form must be made easier if the form is to be used\nseveral times. In this case, the adhesion of various materials to each other is to be considered\nas well as the exact arrangement as lack of air circulation results in high adhesive forces during\nthe separation process.\nHydrophobic substances such as fats are usually used as release agents. These can be applied\ndirectly onto the forms. A free-flowing greasy substance thereby allows through-flow of air\nfrom the pore space and enables easy removal from the mold.\nIn case strong forces are created during unmolding, the forms can be strengthened prior to use\nby infiltration. For example, this can be done by epoxy.\nNew Trends in 3D Printing74\nIn some cases, the integration of ejectors into the mold is advisable. These can be implemented\nas jacking screws. \nTargeted stresses can be built up in the area of the form in order to reduced\nbending stresses while separating the mold.\nFigure 15. (a) Printed form mounted (form for casting upside down) and (b) designer sink made from concrete.\nThe mechanical properties are relevant for multiple phases in the application of these proc‐\nesses. Strength is \ndesirable during the handling phase and while filling the mold. While de-\nmolding of disposable forms, low strengths are desired. Particularly suitable are shapes and\nforms whose strength can be influenced after casting. These can be water-soluble forms with\na hydrophobic coating or forms whose binder loses strength even at very low temperatures.\nThe thermal behavior of the forms plays a subordinate role in this process. Similarly, loss on\nignition or residual ash is not relevant.\nIn this process, accuracy and surface quality are just as relevant as in the metal casting.\nHowever, the proportions of the surface features of the component dimensions are often so\nextreme that the surface finish plays only a subordinate role. The achievable accuracies usually\ndo not greatly exceed the general requirements in the construction industry.\nSee Figure 16 for an experimental casting of a large-scale structure.\nFigure 16. (a) Composite mold from 3D printed formwork elements and (b) resulting large-scale concrete member.\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n75\n5. Investment casting with positive molds using PBJ printed material\n5.1. Theory, chemical, and physical basics\n5.1.1. Conventional investment casting\nThe investment casting \nprocess is used to produce metal parts that have finer details, thinner\nwall thicknesses, and superior surface quality compared with parts generated by the sand\ncasting process. Since the foundation of the process is a positive model, the process differs in\nits substantial process steps from the sand casting process. See Figure 17 for details. In this\nsection, various methods are described to create cavities which can then be applied in the metal\ncasting process (compare [18]).\nFigure 17. Steps of investment casting: (a) positive model, (b) fixed gating system, (c) mounting of the (wax) cluster, (d)\nembedding in plaster or ceramics slurry, (e) setting of the shell, (f) burn-out of the model and the gating system with\nhardening of the shell, (g) casting, and (h) production result.\nThe basis of the investment casting process is a positive model, which are always lost models\nin contrast to \nthe models used in sand casting. These models can be produced by artisans\nmanually using the traditional way or by applying industrial mass-production technology.\nThe models are often produced by injection molding out of wax. As in the plastics processing,\nthe wax is injected under high pressure into a metal mold and removed from the mold after\ncooling. In order to increase the dimensional stability and to change other properties, the wax\nis often filled with microgranules. The granules themselves are mostly plastics such as\npolystyrene or polyethylene.\nThe individual wax models are attached to further wax model in the production cycle. This\nwax model serves as a carrier and defines the gating in the subsequent casting of the liquid\nNew Trends in 3D Printing76\nmetal. The individual models are connected using thermal wax to the gating. The upper part\nof the gating widens conically and later represents the pouring funnel.\nThe shape thus \nobtained is further processed in the conventional method in two ways. The\nfirst method is to immerse the mold in liquid plaster. After the plaster has hardened, the mold\nis placed in an oven for heat treatment. Here, the wax evaporates or burns out and exposes the\nactual casting cavity. The second option is to generate a ceramic shell by repeated applying a\ncoat of ceramic slurry. It is then fired in a kiln. During this process, the model evaporates or\ngets burnt out.\nBoth methods differ in the cooling rates which are attained later in the casting process.\nEspecially, the simpler method using gypsum often produces an inferior metal structure and\nthus a casting of poor strength.\n5.1.2. A PBJ process for the generation positive burn-out models\nIn principle, several methods are suitable for the realization of the above-described investment\ncasting process using additives manufacturing methods. These methods are wax or acrylate\ndirect print processes, laser sintering of polystyrene, or stereolithography. Each method\ndemonstrates specific characteristics which in turn make them the preferred method to apply\ndepending on the production environment and related variables (see [25]). Different levels of\ncomponents can be built by these technologies: from the single part model up to a complete\ncluster (see Figure 18).\nAn essential feature underlying all methods is the melt-out or burn-out property of the additive\nmaterial that is being applied. Here, residue-free burn-out during the process (as far as\npossible) is important from an economic point of view as purification steps can thus be avoided.\nIndividual melting is not sufficient, as the melt cannot run out from complex shapes and the\nmaterial is able to leave the channels only in a gaseous state.\nFigure 18. Production levels of components using AM processes for precision casting tools: (a) positive-model, (b)\nmodel with sprues, and (c) complete cluster with gating.\nThe PBJ method uses an acrylate-based printing process for investment casting. PMMA\npowder serves usually as base material.\nThe process is \ndescribed in detail in the subchapter “sand casting.” After lowering the build\nplatform, a layer of PMMA powder is spread over the built platform with the help of the\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n77\nrecoater. The achievable minimum layer thickness is well below that of the sand casting process\nand reaches 80 \nµm. Through a binder system technology, the powder particles stick to each\nother whereby binder is applied on to the powder bed by an inkjet print head by using\npreprogrammed bitmap data. For this purpose, solvent-based adhesives can be used as well\nas polymerized adhesive. For the latter process, one component of a multicomponent adhesive\nsystem is added to the powder.\nThe basic chemical reaction of the polymerizing system is a free-radical polymerization. An\ninitiator, for example, dibenzoylperoxide, is present in the powder itself. The concentration\ncan be adjusted as required during powder production. At higher temperatures, the initiator\ndecomposes into two radicals depending on the type of initiator used.\nThe actual ink contains monomers. These monomers have radically polymerizable chemical\ndouble bonds, which are the key reactants for the chain reaction in curing of such materials\n(Figure 19). In addition, the binder includes an activator which brings about the decomposition\nof the initiator and at the same time generates initiating radicals. In this case, the activator\nreduces the temperature of the disintegration under the room temperature. When ink pene‐\ntrates into the powder, initiator from the powder is released and is activated by the activator.\nThe radicals are bound to the monomers (chain initiation), whereby a new radical is formed,\nwhich reacts with another monomer (chain continued) in turn form further radicals. Thus, a\nchain reaction that leads to macromolecules is formed which makes up the strength of the bond\n(see micrographs of the bonds in Figure 20). The reaction stops (chain termination) if, for\nexample, radicals react with each other (recombination) or the reaction mixture of reactive\nmonomers increasingly reduces leading to a failure in reaction. The achievable strength\ndepends on many factors, which in turn affect the chain reaction (see [26]).\nFigure 19. Chemistry involved in the vx-acrylate process.\nNew Trends in 3D Printing78\nFigure 20. SEM micrographs of particles bound by the PolyPor method (a) magnified 600 times and (b) magnified 1200\ntimes.\n5.2. Methods for the characterization of PBJ generated parts for investment casting\nIn investment casting \nprocesses, just as in the case of sand casting, special component prop‐\nerties need to be achieved in order to support further processing steps.\nMaterial strength values are important in order to allow safe handling of the component. But\ntoo high material strength values and a high modulus of elasticity are in fact damaging and\nthus harmful for follow-up processes. Here as well, a low thermal expansion coefficient is\nimportant. The mechanical characteristics are determined with a tensile testing machine of the\ntype ZMART.PRO from the company Zwick. Here, the tensile testing program is carried out\nat room temperature at a speed of 1 mm/s. The measurement is carried out without displace‐\nment transducer. As a sample, a tensile testing rod is used with the cross-sectional dimensions\n10 × 4 mm2 (see Figure 21). The load cell has a measuring range of 2 kN.\nFigure 21. Test specimen dimensions for PBJ-parts used in investment casting.\nFor the embedding process, a closed surface is required. Without this closed surface, water can\npenetrate into the \nmodel. This could negatively affect the mold during burn-out in terms of\ncracks or disintegration of the shell. The surfaces of the PBJ-printed models are coated as\nporous surface adversely affect the follow-up processes of the above-mentioned processes.\nThus, it is advisable to treat the model with liquid wax. The wax solidifies on the surface or\npenetrates by capillary action deep into the model, depending on the immersion conditions\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n79\nand temperatures of the wax or the component. A quick immersion of a cool component leads\nto a wax \nlayer forming on the surface of the actual component. On the other hand, if a\ncomponent is immersed over a longer period it gets almost completely filled with wax and has\na significantly rougher surface.\nThe surface must be sealed for the follow-up process. If only a thin surface layer is obtained\nby the dipping method, there is a risk of microporosities causing surface damage during\nsolidification and shrinkage of the wax (see Figure 22). This may lead to water seeping into\nthe model. Thus, the model may be damaged during burn-out. The method of immersing\ncomponents for a longer time poses the risk of component distortion due to the temperature\nreaction as well as the creation of rough surfaces.\nFigure 22. SEM microscopy of a wax treated surface with pinhole defect.\nThis microporosity can be detected with the dye-penetration technique in accordance with\nDIN/ISO EN 571-1. \nHere, the dye accumulates in the microporosity and reveals the critical\nareas. Such critical areas must be reworked before the furnace process (Figure 23).\nFigure 23. (a) Diagram showing after-treatment of porous components and (b) test: (i) waxed component, (ii) test color,\n(iii) the component after cleaning, (iv) the component after application of the developer.\nNew Trends in 3D Printing80\nAfter burning out, the residual ash is also an important factor for safe processing. In particular,\nundertaking cleaning steps \nafter the casting cavity has been formed through burn-out is not\nadvisable economically.\nThe residual ash is determined using the conventional ash measuring equipment. Since the\nquantities are very small, the procedure has to be performed with great care (see the steps in\nFigure 24). For the measurement at least 100 g bound material is required. These are added to\na previously extensively heated bowl. After weighing, the plate is placed in an oven and heated\nup to 700°C. This temperature is maintained for at least 4 h. After cooling down for several\nhours, the dish is weighed again. The difference to the tare value will be read from the amount\nweighed. The quotient is thus residual ash. A residual ash content of less than 0.1% is consid‐\nered as free of residual ash.\nFigure 24. Methodology for determination of residual ash.\nIn this method, the properties are determined with a test job, just as in the case of the sand\ncasting process. As \nmaterial system, the PolyPorB system from voxeljet is used. The test job is\nbuilt on a VX1000 machine from voxeljet. The surface quality is determined based on test\nblocks. Waxed as well as nonwaxed samples are used.\n5.3. Experimental results\nThe density of the plastic components differs from the density of these parts because of the\nmassively different density in relation to sand components. A mean of 0.63 g/cm 3 is meas‐\nured .The scattering is relatively small with a range within a build direction of 0.02 g/cm3.

The \ntensile strength reaches a maximum of 3.3 MPa and a mean of 2.7 MPa.\nHere, the relative anisotropy of the strongest to weakest direction is 60%. The elongation at\nbreak is consistently less than 1.5%. Therefore, in the fracture behavior, it behaves similar to a\nglass-like material (refer to Table 10).\nOrientation X Y Z\nMin. Mean Max. Min.

Surface characteristics of PolyPorB parts for investment casting.\nThe length deviation of the material depends in part on the storage and aging of the compo‐\nnents. In compliance \nwith the prescribed standard processes, the measurement shows an\naverage percentage deviation from 0.7%. The deviation is always negative, and thus produced\nshrinkage. The shrinkage is anisotropic and reaches its minimum in the Z-direction. This shows\na correlation to the direction of the weakest point.\nOn average, q roughness Ra of 19.9 µm is achieved. The highest roughness is an Ra of 25.8 µm.\nIf parts are waxed, the roughness varies according to the waxing procedure. If the component\nis dipped briefly, an Ra significantly below 10 µm is achieved. The components that are dipped\nlonger the roughness corresponds to that of a nonwaxed part (Table 11).\nThe thermal expansion of nonwaxed components largely corresponds to the base material\nPMMA. The measurement shows a thermal expansion coefficient of 100 × 10−6 K−1. In the region\nof low temperatures, the wax on the surface of the waxed components will melt. Thus, the\nthermal expansion seen in the investment casting process can be compensated during the burn-\nout of the printed component.\nThe test pieces which were immersed for a short time show a homogeneous image with no\ncolor inclusions along the surfaces during the penetration test. The edges of the component\nexhibit a slightly porous surface, which can be identified due to its pink color. Long immersed\nparts turn totally pink and penetrant testing confirms the (adverse) reading of the surface\ncondition. In bodies having complex geometries, particularly the outer and inner edges are\nNew Trends in 3D Printing82\nplaced where errors occur. Cracks and tears in the wax surface can be clearly observed by their\ndistinct red color (Figure 25).\nFigure 25.

Discussion\nIn the case \nof investment casting processes, as opposed to the conventional sand casting\nmethods, the finished models are not directly comparable with PBJ-printed models. In the first\nprocess, the part to be compared is built up by injecting a liquid, and in the second process the\npart is made using particulate material. The strength of PBJ-printed components is sufficient\nfor safe handling during subsequent process steps. The high brittleness needs to be considered\nduring handling. However, the lower density, which is present due to the porosity of the\ncomponent, makes the parts easy to handle.\nThe geometry is strongly influenced by shrinkage. However, this shrinkage can be easily\nsimulated and nearly completely compensated by an increase in the geometry of the raw data.\nThe surface roughness of the models in the untreated state does not meet the requirements of\na “precise casting procedure”. Through a postprocess procedure which is suitably adapted to\nthe task (in this case wax treatment), the desired measurements can be achieved here as well.\nThe surface of the model has to be sealed, as during the post-treatment process it is immersed\nin a liquid. The surfaced can be sealed by immersing them in wax. The color infiltration method\nshows that special care is needed and further steps to ensure that the part is completely coated\n(sealed) may be necessary.\nThermal expansion of the basic structure of the particulate material can be compensated by\napplying a coating of wax. The type of wax selected and its melting point play an important\nrole.\nDuring burn-out which exposes the casting cavity, very little residual ash is left behind, this\ncan be attributed to the combination of the raw materials, namely, PMMA and wax used in\nthe process. By applying a suitable process, cleaning of the form can be avoided after burn-out\nand metal can be poured directly into the hot mold.\nAdditive Manufacturing of Casting Tools Using Powder-Binder-Jetting Technology\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/62532\n83\n6. Summary\nModels, e.g., molds \nand cores, for casting applications can be created using the additive\nmanufacturing process PBJ. Liquid material can either be added directly into the mold after\nprinting to obtain a cast part or a printed model is further processed using the investment\ncasting process. The results show that the material properties meet the demands for a wide\napplication in this field of application. Metals, as well as resins and thermosets, ceramic, or\nconcrete fluids are processed. Quality assurance during production can be assured by applying\nthe testing and measuring methods described in this chapter.\nDue to the ongoing development in technology, the production quantities as well as perform‐\nance can be enhanced. This advancement in technology and knowhow goes hand-in-hand with\nthe reduction in costs, which makes it possible to produce even larger series using the PBJ\nmethod. At present, series comprising a few thousands parts are already economically viable.\nThrough this ever-increasing advancement in technology, even larger series will be realized\nand thus inflexible production machines and dated technologies will eventually be replaced\nin several areas of production.\nAuthor details\nDaniel Günther* and Florian Mögele\n*Address all correspondence to: dg@voxeljet.de\nvoxeljet AG, Friedberg, Germany\nReferences\n[1] Ederer, I.
