King\nR\necent years have witnessed the development of a New IS-LM model\nthat is increasingly being used to discuss the determination of macroe-\nconomic activity and the design of monetary policy rules. It is some-\ntimes called an “optimizing IS-LM model ” because it can be built up from\nmicrofoundations. It is alternatively called an “expectational IS-LM model”\nbecause the traditional model’s behavioral equations are modiﬁed to include\nexpectational terms suggested by these microfoundations and because the new\nframework is analyzed using rational expectations. The purpose of this article\nis to provide a simple exposition of the New IS-LM model and to discuss how\nit leads to strong conclusions about monetary policy in four important areas.\n• Desirability of price level or inﬂation targeting: The new model sug-\ngests that a monetary policy that targets inﬂation at a low level will keep\neconomic activity near capacity. If there are no exogenous “inﬂation\nshocks,” then full stabilization of the price level will also maintain out-\nput at its capacity level. More generally, the new model indicates that\ntime-varying inﬂation targets should not respond to many economic\ndisturbances, including shocks to productivity, aggregate demand, and\nthe demand for money.\n• Interest rate behavior under inﬂation targeting:The new model incor-\nporates the twin principles of interest rate determination, originally de-\nveloped by Irving Fisher, which are an essential component of modern\nmacroeconomics. The real interest rate is a key intertemporal relative\nProfessor of Economics, Boston University. The author wishes to thank Michael Dotsey,\nMarvin Goodfriend, Robert Hetzel, John Taylor, and Alexander Wolman for detailed comments\nthat materially improved the paper. The views expressed in this paper do not necessarily re ﬂect\nthose of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond or the Federal Reserve System.\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly V olume 86/3 Summer 2000 45\n46 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nprice, which increases when there is greater expected growth in real\nactivity and falls when the economy slows. The nominal interest rate\nis the sum of the real interest rate and expected inﬂation. Accordingly,\na central bank pursuing an in ﬂation-targeting policy designed to keep\noutput near capacity must raise the nominal rate when the economy ’s\nexpected growth rate of capacity output increases and lower it when\nthe expected growth rate declines.\n• Limits on monetary policy: There are two limits on monetary policy\nemphasized by this model. First, the monetary authority cannot engi-\nneer a permanent departure of output from its capacity level. Second,\nmonetary policy rules must be restricted if there is to be a unique ra-\ntional expectations equilibrium. In particular, as is apparently the case\nin many countries, suppose that the central bank uses an interest rate\ninstrument and that it raises the rate when inﬂation rises relative to tar-\nget. Then the New IS-LM model implies that it must do so aggressively\n(raising the rate by more than one-for-one) if there is to be a unique,\nstable equilibrium. But if the central bank responds to both current and\nprospective inﬂation, then it is also important that it not respond too\naggressively.\n• Effects of monetary policy:Within the new model, monetary policy can\ninduce temporary departures of output from its capacity level. How-\never, in contrast to some earlier models, these departures generally will\nnot be serially uncorrelated. If the central bank engineers a permanent\nincrease in nominal income, for example, then there will be an increase\nin output that will persist for a number of periods before fully dissi-\npating in price adjustment. Further, the model implies that the form of\nthe monetary policy rule is important for how the economy responds\nto various real and monetary disturbances.\nIn summary, the New IS-LM model instructs the central bank to target\ninﬂation. It indicates that there are substantial limits on the long-run inﬂuence\nthat the monetary authority can have on real economic activity and that there\nare also constraints on its choice of policy rule. But the New IS-LM also\nindicates that the monetary authority can affect macroeconomic ﬂuctuations\nthrough its choice of the monetary policy rule, as well as via monetary policy\nshocks.\nThe plan of the article is as follows. Section 1 provides some historical\nbackground on the evolution of the IS-LM model since its origin in Hicks\n(1937). Section 2 then quickly lays out the equations of the closed economy\nversion of the New IS-LM model. Section 3 uses the framework to show how\na neutral monetary policy— a policy which keeps output close to its capacity\nlevel— implies a speciﬁci nﬂation targeting regime and, if certain exogenous\nshocks are small, rationalizes a full stabilization of the price level. Following\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 47\nGoodfriend and King (1997), such a policy is called a “neutral monetary\npolicy” and the new model is used to determine some rules for the setting of\nalternative monetary instruments that would yield the neutral level of output.\nThe article next turns to understanding the mechanics of the New IS-LM\nmodel. Proponents of IS-LM modeling typically stress that sticky prices are\ncentral to understanding macroeconomic activity (e.g., Mankiw [1990]) so\nthat the discussion begins in Section 4 with this topic. Firms are assumed to\nset prices and adjust quantity in response to changes in demand. But in the\nNew IS-LM model, ﬁrms are assumed to be forward-looking in their price-\nsetting, in line with research that begins with Taylor (1980). Forward-looking\nprice-setting has major effects on the linkage between nominal disturbances\nand economic activity, endowing the model with a mix of Keynesian and\nClassical implications. Section 5 considers the long-run limits on monetary\npolicy given this “supply side” speciﬁcation and several related topics.\nTurning to the aggregate demand side, the new model ’s IS schedule is\nalso forward looking. Section 6 starts by discussing why this is the inevitable\nattribute of optimizing consumption-investment decisions and then considers\nsome macroeconomic implications of the new model’s IS schedule.\nThe macroeconomic equilibrium of the New IS-LM model is employed\nto analyze three key issues that are relevant to monetary policy. Section 7\nconsiders limits on interest rate rules. Section 8 highlights how monetary\npolicy can produce short-run departures of output from its capacity level,\neither as a result of monetary shocks or as a result of a policy rule which\ndiffers from the neutral rules developed in Section 3. It also considers the\norigin and nature of the tradeoff between inﬂation and output variability that\nis present in this model. The article is completed by a brief concluding section.\n1. THE EVOLUTION OF THE IS-LM MODEL\nBefore detailing the model, it is useful to brieﬂy review the historical process\nthat has led to its development and inﬂuences its current uses. Since the 1930s,\nvariants of the IS-LM model have been the standard framework for macroe-\nconomic analysis. Initially, Hicks ’s (1937) version was used to explain how\noutput and interest rates would be affected by various shocks and alternative\npolicy responses. Subsequent developments broadened the range of issues\nthat could be studied with the model, notably the introduction of an aggregate\nproduction function and a labor market by Modigliani (1944). With the rise\nof quantitative frameworks for monetary policy analysis— such as the Penn-\nFRB-MIT model, which was employed by the Federal Reserve System— the\nrole of the IS-LM model changed in a subtle manner. After detailed explana-\ntions were worked out in these policy laboratories, the IS-LM model was used\nto give a simple account of the ﬁndings.\n48 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nWhile the initial IS-LM model did not determine how the price level\nevolved through time, the addition of a price equation— or a wage/price block\nthat featured a Phillips (1958) curve — made it possible to explore the im-\nplications for in ﬂation.1 The simultaneous occurrence of high in ﬂation and\nhigh unemployment in the 1970s led macroeconomists to question this as-\npect of theoretical and quantitative macromodels. Further, during the ratio-\nnal expectations revolution spurred by Lucas (1976), fundamental questions\nwere raised about the value of the IS-LM model and the related quantitative\nmacroeconomic policy models. The IS-LM model was portrayed as being\nfatally inconsistent with optimizing behavior on the part of households and\nﬁrms (Lucas 1980). The quantitative macropolicy models were criticized for\nnot using microfoundations as a guide to the speciﬁcation of estimable equa-\ntions and also for avoiding central issues of identiﬁcation (Sims 1980, Sargent\n1981). The rational expectations revolution suggested that new macroeco-\nnomic frameworks were necessary — both small analytical frameworks like\nthe IS-LM model and larger quantitative macropolicy models— and that these\nwould lead to a substantial revision in thinking about the limits on monetary\npolicy and the role of monetary policy.\nOne initial attempt at updating the IS-LM model was initiated in Sar-\ngent and Wallace (1975), who incorporated a version of the aggregate supply\ntheory developed by Lucas (1972, 1973) in place of the Phillips curve or\nwage/price block. According to this rational expectations IS-LM model, sys-\ntematic monetary policy could not inﬂuence real economic activity, although\nmonetary shocks could cause temporary departures of output from its capac-\nity level. This ﬁnding that systematic monetary policy was irrelevant led the\nrelated literature to be described, by some, as the New Classical macroeco-\nnomics. Sargent and Wallace also used their framework to argue against use\nof the nominal interest rate as the instrument of monetary policy— suggesting\nthat this practice was inconsistent with a unique macroeconomic equilibrium.\nWhile this rational expectations IS-LM model was subsequently used to clar-\nify issues of importance for monetary policy — for example, Parkin (1978)\nand McCallum (1981) showed that an appropriate nominal anchor could al-\nlow the interest rate to be used as the instrument of monetary policy — it did\nnot gain widespread acceptance for three reasons. First, some economists —\nparticularly macroeconomic theorists— saw the model as ﬂawed, because its\nlack of microfoundations led it to lack the behavioral consistency conditions\nwhich are the inevitable result of optimization and the expectational consid-\nerations which are at the heart of dynamic economic theory. Second, other\neconomists— particularly applied macroeconomists— were suspicious of the\n1 With this addition, the Hicksian setup was sometimes and more accurately called an IS-\nLM-PC model, but it has been more commonly referred to by its shorter title, as will be the\npractice in this article.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 49\nmodel because it suggested that departures of output from capacity should be\nserially uncorrelated. Third, many economists — including central bankers—\nremained convinced that the systematic choices of the monetary authority\nwere important for the character of economic ﬂuctuations and thus rejected\nthe model due to the “policy irrelevance” implication.\nIn recent years, there has been the development of small, optimizing macro\nmodels that combine Classical and Keynesian features in a “New Neoclassi-\ncal Synthesis.”\n2 The New IS-LM model is an outgrowth of this more general\nresearch program and is thus designed to incorporate the major accomplish-\nments of the rational expectations revolution, including a more careful deriva-\ntion from microfoundations, while retaining the stark simplicity that made the\nearlier IS-LM frameworks much employed tools. One important use of the\nNew IS-LM model is to communicate results from other, more complicated\nmacroeconomic models that are relevant to monetary policy. For example,\nKerr and King (1996) ﬁrst used the core equations of the New IS-LM model\nto exposit issues involving interest rate rules for monetary policy that had\narisen in my research on small, fully articulated macroeconomic models with\nsticky prices and intertemporal optimization (King and Watson 1996; King\nand Wolman 1999).\n3 The current article shows how the New IS-LM model is\nalso useful in expositing many issues that arise in these sorts of small, fully\narticulated models and also in larger quantitative macroeconomic models that\nare currently employed for monetary policy analysis, including the new ratio-\nnal expectations framework of the Federal Reserve (the FRB-US model) and\nthe various U.S. and international models developed by Taylor (1993). In fact,\nin using the model to discuss the implications of sticky prices, restrictions on\ninterest rate policy rules, and the trade-off between the variability of inﬂation\nand output, the article will touch repeatedly on themes which have been central\nparts of Taylor’s research program.\n2. THE NEW IS-LM MODEL\nLike its predecessors, the New IS-LM model is a small macroeconomic model\ndesigned to describe the behavior of economy-wide variables that enter in most\ndiscussions of monetary policy. There are ﬁve endogenous variables: the log\nlevel of real output/spending y, the log price level P, the real interest rate r,\nthe inﬂation rate π, and the nominal interest rate R.\n4\n2 See Goodfriend and King (1997) for a detailed discussion of these developments.\n3 Bernanke and Woodford (1997) and Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999) have since made\nsimilar use of essentially the same framework to study various monetary policy issues. Related\nanalyses using variations on the New IS-LM approach include McCallum and Nelson (1999) and\nKoenig (1993a,b); these authors use an alternative approach to aggregate supply.\n4 The New IS-LM model is most frequently presented in discrete time so as to keep the\nmathematical analysis as simple as possible (see Kimball [1995] for a continuous time analysis of\n50 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nThe Core Equations\nThree speciﬁcations are present in all of the recent papers that employ the New\nIS-LM model. These are an IS equation, a Fisher equation, and a Phillips curve\nequation.\nThe forward-looking IS equationmakes current real spendingy\nt depend\non the expected future level of real spendingEtyt+1 and the real interest ratert.\nThere is also an aggregate demand shock xdt : a positive xdt raises aggregate\nspending at given levels of the endogenous determinants Etyt+1 and rt.5\nIS : yt = Etyt+1 − s[rt − r] + xdt (1)\nThe parameters> 0 determines the effect of the real interest rate on aggregate\ndemand: If s is larger then a given rise in the real interest rate causes a larger\ndecline in real demand. The parameter r> 0 represents the rate of interest\nwhich would prevail in the absence of output growth and aggregate demand\nshocks. The new IS equation is described as forward-looking because E\ntyt+1\nenters on the right-hand side.\nThe Fisher equation makes the nominal interest rateRt equal to the sum\nof the real interest rate rt and the rate of inﬂation that is expected to prevail\nbetween t and t+1, Etπt+1.\nF : Rt = rt + Etπt+1 (2)\nThis conventional speciﬁcation of the Fisher equation omits any inﬂation risk\npremium in the nominal interest rate.6\nThe expectational Phillips curve relates the current in ﬂation rate πt to\nexpected future inﬂation Etπt+1, the gap between current output yt and ca-\npacity output yt, and an inﬂation shock xπt .\nPC : πt = βEtπt+1 + ϕ(yt − yt) + xπt (3)\nThe parameter β satisﬁes 0 ≤ β ≤ 1. The parameter ϕ> 0 governs how\ninﬂation responds to deviations of output from the capacity level. If there is\na larger value of ϕ then there is a greater effect of output on inﬂation; in this\nsense, prices may be described as adjusting faster— being more ﬂexible— if ϕ\nis greater.\na related but more elaborate model). The discrete time approach also facilitates discussion of the\nrelationship between the theoretical model ’s parameters and estimates obtained in empirical studies.\nLike many other macroeconomic theories developed since Sargent (1973), the model is constructed\nas a linear difference system, which makes it relatively straightforward to calculate the rational\nexpectations equilibrium.\n5 The notation used in this case will carry over to the rest of the article: shocks are called\nx and their nature is identi ﬁed with a subscript, such as d for demand in this case. The exact\nstatistical properties of xdt are not speci ﬁed at present, but they are taken to be stationary random\nvariables with a zero mean.\n6 See McCallum and Nelson (1999a) for additional discussion of this issue.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 51\nUsing the deﬁnition of the inﬂation rate πt = Pt −Pt−1, this speciﬁcation\nmight alternatively have been written as Pt = Pt−1 + βEtπt+1 + ϕ(yt −\nyt) + xπt . This alternative form highlights why (3) is sometimes called a\n“price equation” or an “aggregate supply schedule. ” It is a price equation\nin the sense that it is based on a theory of how ﬁrms adjust their prices,\nas discussed further in Section 4 below. It is an aggregate supply schedule\nbecause it indicates how the quantity supplied depends on the price level and\nother factors. But this article uses the Phillips curve terminology because this\nis the dominant practice in the new and old IS-LM literature.\nThe relationship between the output gap and the steady-state rate of in-\nﬂation gap is given by y −\ny = 1−β\nϕ π according to this speciﬁcation. In fact,\nexperiments with fully articulated models that contain the structural features\nwhich lead to (3) — including those of King and Wolman (1999) — suggest a\nnegligible “long-run effect” at moderate inﬂation rates. Prominent studies of\nthe monetary policy implications of the New IS-LM model— including that of\nClarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999) — accordingly impose the β = 1 condition\nin specifying (3). In this article, β will be taken to be less than but arbitrarily\nclose to one.\nMoney Demand and Monetary Policy\nTo close the model and determine the behavior of output, the price level and\nother variables, it is necessary to specify the monetary equilibrium condition.\nResearchers presently adopt two very different strategies within the literature\non the New IS-LM model.\nSpecifying money demand and money supply . Under this conventional\nstrategy, the money demand function is typically assumed to take the form\nMD : M\nt − Pt = δyt − γRt − xvt (4)\nwith Mt − Pt being the demand for real balances. This demand for money\nhas an income elasticity of δ> 0 and an interest semielasticity of −γ< 0.7\nThere is a shock which lowers the demand for money, xvt: this is a shock to\nvelocity when δ = 1 and γ = 0.\nThe money supply functionis assumed to contain a systematic monetary\npolicy component, fMt , and a shock component xMt :\nMS : Mt = fMt + xMt. (5)\nThe monetary authority’s systematic component may contain responses to the\ncurrent state, lagged or expected future level of economic activity. Taken\ntogether, these equations determine the quantity of money and also provide\n7 Sargent (1973) showed that this semilogarithmic form is very convient for small rational\nexpectations models.\n52 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nFigure 1\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 53\none additional restriction on the comovement of output, the price level and\ninterest rates.\nSpecifying an interest rate rule for monetary policy. An alternative— and\nincreasingly popular— strategy is to simply specify an interest rate rule for\nmonetary policy,\nIR : Rt = fRt + xRt, (6)\nwhich contains a systematic component, fRt, and a shock component xRt.\nUnder this rule, the quantity of money is demand-determined at the Rt\nwhich is set by the monetary authority. Thus, the behavior of the money stock\ncan be deduced, from (4) and (6), as Mt − Pt = δyt − γ[fRt + xRt] − xvt.\nBut since the stock of money is not otherwise relevant for the determination of\nmacroeconomic activity, some analysts proceed without introducing money\nat all.\n8\nWhat Is New about This Model?\nThe answer to this question depends on the chosen starting point in the history\nof macroeconomic thought.\nRelative to the original model of Hicks, the New IS-LM model is different\nin that it makes the price level an endogenous variable, which is in ﬂuenced\nby exogenous shocks and the monetary policy rule. In the language of Fried-\nman (1970) and other monetarists, the New IS-LM model views the price\nlevel as a monetary phenomenon rather than as an unexplained institutional\nphenomenon. In terms of formal modeling, the idea that the price level is a\nmonetary phenomenon is represented in two ways. First, the model cannot\nbe solved for all of the endogenous variables without the speci ﬁcation of a\nmonetary policy rule. Second, under a money stock rule, even though some\nindividual prices are sticky in the short run, the price level responds to exoge-\nnous, permanent changes in the level of the money stock in both the short run\nand the long run. But, since the 1970s, textbook presentations of the IS-LM\nmodel have added a pricing block or aggregate supply schedule, which makes\nthe price level endogenous.\nThe New IS-LM model also incorporates expectations in ways that the\ntraditional IS-LM model did not. But the rational expectations IS-LM model\nof Sargent and Wallace (1975) also incorporated the inﬂuence of expectations\nof inﬂation into both the Fisher equation and the aggregate supply schedule.\nModern textbook treatments discuss these expectations mechanisms in detail.\n8 For example, Kerr and King (1996) discuss how one can manipulate an “IS model ” to\nstudy limits on interest rate rules and Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999) conduct their discussion\nof the “science of monetary policy ” within this model without specifying the supply and demand\nfor money.\n54 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nFigure 1 shows two of the New IS-LM model ’s key equations. As in\nmodern textbooks, there is an IS curve which makes output depend negatively\non the (real) interest rate and a Phillips curve or aggregate supply schedule\nwhich makes output depend positively on the inﬂation rate. Relative to these\npresentations, the New IS-LM model differs (i) in the stress that it places on\nexpectations in both aggregate demand and aggregate supply and (ii) in the\nparticular ways in which expectations are assumed to enter into the model. In\nparticular, the new IS schedule (1) identi ﬁes expected future income/output\nas a key determinant of current output, while this is missing in the Sargent-\nWallace model. The new aggregate supply schedule or Phillips curve (3)\nidentiﬁes expected future in ﬂation as a key determinant of current in ﬂation,\nwhile in the Sargent-Wallace model it is yesterday’s expectation of the current\ninﬂation rate that is relevant for supply.\nThese channels of inﬂuence are highlighted in Figure 1. In panel a of the\nﬁgure, an increase in expected future output shifts the IS curve to the right,\nrequiring a higher real interest rate at any given level of output. In panel b of\nthe ﬁgure, an increase in expected future inﬂation shifts the Phillips curve to\nthe left, requiring a higher current inﬂation rate at any given level of output.\nHowever, while it is possible to express these behavioral equations in\nfamiliar graphical ways, the reader should not be misled into thinking that\nmacroeconomic analysis can be conducted by simple curve-shifting when\nexpectations are rational in the sense of Muth (1961).\n9 Instead, it is necessary\nto solve simultaneously for current and expected future variables, essentially\nby determining the complete path that the economy is expected to follow. Once\nthis path is known, it is possible to return to the individual graphs of the IS\ncurve or the Phillips curve to describe the effects of shocks or policy rules.\n10\nBut this is not the same as deriving the result by shifting the curves.\n3. NEUTRAL MONETARY POLICY\nIf the monetary authority’s objective is to stabilize real economic activity at the\ncapacity level, the New IS-LM model provides a direct case for an in ﬂation-\ntargeting monetary policy.\n9 Expectations are assumed to be rational in Muth ’s sense in this article and related literature.\nIt is also worth noting that this article and much of the related literature also assumes that there\nis full current information and that monetary policy rules are credible.\n10 This point is related to the discussion in King (1993), where I argued that the traditional\nIS-LM model is ﬂawed due to its treatment of expectations and could not be resurrected by the\nNew Keynesian research program. In particular, while I noted that “every macroeconomic model\ncontains some set of equations that can be labelled as its IS and LM components, since these are\njust conditions of equilibrium in the goods and money markets, ” I also stressed that “while some of\nus may choose to use the IS-LM framework to express results that have been discovered in richer\nmodels, it is not a vehicle for deriving those results. To simplify economic reality suf ﬁciently to\nuse the IS-LM model as an analytical tool, economists must essentially ignore expectations.... ”\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 55\nInﬂation Implications\nIn the New IS-LM model, there is a direct link between the objective of keeping\noutput at a capacity level— which Goodfriend and King (1997) call a neutral\nmonetary policy objective— and the dynamics of inﬂation. Setting yt = yt in\n(3) and solving this expression forward implies that\nπt = βEtπt+1 + xπt =\n∞∑\nj=0\nβjEtxπ,t+j. (7)\nThis solution has three direct implications.\nThe case for price stability: If there are no inﬂation shocks (xπt = 0 for\nall t) then the solution is that the inﬂation rate should always be zero. This is a\nstriking, basic implication of the New IS-LM model. Reversing the direction\nof causation, it means that a central bank which keeps the price level constant\nalso makes output always equal to the capacity level. Finally, it means that\nshocks to aggregate demand such as x\ndt and to the determinants of capacity\noutput yt do not affect the price level under a neutral monetary policy regime.\nThe case for simple inﬂation targets: If there are in ﬂation shocks, there\ncontinues to be an average in ﬂation rate of zero under a neutral monetary\npolicy.11 However, as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999) stress, the New IS-LM\nmodel suggests that there may be sustained departures from the zero long-run\ninﬂation target as a result of inﬂation shocks. For example, if the shock term\nis a ﬁrst-order autoregression, x\nπt = ρxπ,t−1 + eπt , then the solution for the\nneutral inﬂation rate is\nπt = 1\n1 − βρ xπt = ρπt−1 + 1\n1 − βρ eπt ,\nso that the in ﬂation target inherits the persistence properties of the in ﬂation\nshock. If the persistence parameter ρ is positive, then a higher-than-average\ncurrent inﬂation target implies that there will be, on average, a higher-than-\naverage inﬂation target in the future.\nIn this setting, a central bank must more actively manage inﬂation in order\nto keep output at its capacity level. The New IS-LM model, however, implies\nthat many shocks do not affect the inﬂation rate if it is managed to keep output\nat capacity, including aggregate demand shocks x\ndt , shifts in determinants of\ncapacity output yt, and shocks to the demand for money xvt.\nAppraising This Policy Implication\nThis strong policy conclusion raises a number of questions, which are con-\nsidered in turn. In trying to answer these questions, we encounter a natural\n11 Recall that the in ﬂation shocks are assumed to have a zero mean.\n56 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nlimitation of IS-LM models, new and old. Since these models are not built up\nfrom microfoundations, the answers frequently will require stepping outside\nthe conﬁnes of the model to discuss other, related research.\nIs this result a special one or does it hold in other related models?In fact,\nKing and Wolman (1996) found that a constant in ﬂation target causes real\nactivity to remain at essentially the capacity level when there are changes in\nproductivity or money demand within a fully articulated, quantitative model\n(a setting where sticky prices, imperfect competition and an explicit role for\nmonetary services were added to a standard real business cycle model). The\ngenerality of this conclusion is suggested by the fact that Rotemberg (1996)\nwas led to call it a “mom and apple pie” result in his discussion of King and\nWolman (1996).\n12\nWhat is capacity output? When explicit microfoundations are laid out, it\nis potentially possible to deﬁne a measure of capacity output more precisely.\nGoodfriend and King (1997) followed this approach— within a class of models\nwith sticky prices, imperfect competition, andﬂexible factor reallocation— to\nidentify capacity output as the level of output which would obtain if all nomi-\nnal prices were perfectly ﬂexible, but distortions from imperfect competition\nremained present in the economy.\nIs stabilization at capacity output desirable? If output is inefﬁciently low\ndue to monopoly or other distortions, then it may not be optimal to always\nkeep output at its capacity level: optimal monetary policy may seek to produce\ndeviations of output from capacity in response to underlying shocks. To study\nthis issue carefully, though, it is again necessary to develop microeconomic\nfoundations and to consider the design of monetary policies which maximize\nthe welfare of agents in response to various shocks (as with the productivity\nshocks analyzed in Ireland [1996]). Studying a fully articulated economy with\nmultiperiod price stickiness, King and Wolman (1999) show it is efﬁcient— in\nthe sense of maximizing welfare— to fully stabilize the price level and to keep\noutput at its capacity level in response productivity shocks.\n13\nEconomic Activity under Neutral Policy\nIn the analysis above, the Phillips curve (3) was used to determine the behavior\nof inﬂation which is consistent with output being at its capacity level (y\nt = yt).\nThe other equations of the model economy then restrict the behavior of the\nremaining variables.\n12 He also veri ﬁed that it held in other, related fully articulated models (Rotemberg and\nWoodford 1997, 1999).\n13 See also Goodfriend and King (1997) and Rotemberg and Woodford (1997).\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 57\nGiven that output is at its capacity level, the IS curve then implies that the\nreal rate of interest is\nrt = 1\ns[Etyt+1 − yt + xdt ]. (8)\nThis is a neutral or“natural” real rate of interest, the idea of which is developed\nin more detail in Section 5.2 below. The real rate of interest is positively\naffected by growth in capacity output E\ntyt+1 − yt and by aggregate demand\nshocks xdt .\nTaking this natural rate of interestrt together with expected inﬂation, the\nFisher equation (2) then implies that the nominal interest rate is\nRt = rt + Etπt+1. (9)\nThat is, a neutral interest rate policy must make the nominal interest rate vary\nwith the natural rate of interest and the in ﬂation target (7). For example, if\nthe real economy is expected to display strong real growth in capacity output,\nthen the nominal interest rate must be raised.\n14\nFinally, the money demand function (4) implies that the stock of money\nevolves according to Mt = (πt + Pt−1) + δyt − γRt − xvt. That is, money\ngrowth obeys\nMt − Mt−1 = πt\n+ [δ(yt − yt−1) − γ(Rt − Rt−1) − (xvt − xv,t−1)], (10)\nwhich is the sum of the chosen inﬂation target and the change in the real private\ndemand for money.\nImplementation via a Money Stock Rule\nOne way to implement a neutral monetary policy is via a money stock rule. The\nsolution (10) indicates that in order for the economy to stay at capacity output,\nthe money stock must respond to the state of the economy. In particular, the\ngrowth of the neutral money stock is a complicated function of the exogenous\nvariables of the model. Money growth must move one-for-one with the target\nrate of inﬂation\nπt, which in turn depends on the inﬂation shock xπt . Money\ngrowth must also accommodate the changes in real demand for money brought\nabout by growth in the capacity level of output\nyt, as stressed by Ireland (1996).\nIt must also accommodate shocks to the demand for money and changes in the\nneutral nominal interest rate (which in turn depend on changes in the expected\ngrowth in capacity output and changes in the in ﬂation target from (7)). This\npolicy rule involves choices in the general money supply function (5), namely\nthat there are no money supply shocks ( x\nMt = 0) and that the systematic\n14 Unless there is simultaneously a negative price shock for some reason.\n58 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\ncomponent of policy is given byfMt = Mt−1 + πt + [δ(yt − yt−1)− γ(Rt −\nRt−1) − (xvt − xv,t−1)].\nUnder this rule, the central bank is not responding directly to output,\ninﬂation and so forth. Instead, it is responding to the fundamental determinants\nof economic activity.15 Further, implicit in treating the solution (10) as a policy\nrule is the statement by the monetary authority,“if inﬂation deviates from the\nneutral level then no adjustment in the path of the money stock will occur.” In\nthe rational expectations equilibrium of the New IS-LM model, this statement\nturns out to be suf ﬁcient to assure that no departures of in ﬂation from the\nneutral inﬂation rate ever occur.\nImplementation via an Interest Rate Rule\nThere has been a great deal of research on interest rate rules in recent years\nfor at least three reasons. First, as argued by Goodfriend (1991), this research\nfocus matches well with the fact that the Federal Reserve actually implements\nmonetary policy by choosing the setting of the federal funds rate, a very short-\nterm nominal interest rate. Second, as shown by Taylor (1993), some simple\ninterest rate rules appear to yield a quantitative match with the behavior of\nthe FRS over various time periods. Third, there are interesting conceptual\nissues that arise regarding the determination of macroeconomic activity under\nan interest rate rule.\nIn looking for an interest rate rule that would yield the neutral level of\noutput, a reasonable ﬁrst idea would be to select the interest rate solution\n(9). In the New IS-LM model, as in other many frameworks considered by\nmonetary economics dating back at least to Wicksell, this choice would not be\nenough to assure that the neutral level of real activity would occur. It might,\nbut other levels of economic activity could also arise. One way of thinking\nabout why multiple equilibria may occur is that money is demand-determined\nunder an interest rate rule, so that the monetary authority is implicitly saying\nto the private sector,“any quantity of money which you desire at the speciﬁed\nnominal interest rate\nRt will be supplied.”\nTo eliminate the possibility of multiple equilibria, it is necessary for the\nmonetary authority to specify how it would behave if the economy were to\ndepart from the neutral level. For example, a speciﬁc interest rate rule— which\nresponds to deviations of inﬂation from neutral inﬂation— is\nR\nt = Rt + τ(π t − πt)\n= [rt + Etπt+1] + τ(π t − πt).\n15 From this standpoint, it is clear that the assumption above — that the central bank and other\nactors have complete information about the state of the economy — is a strong one.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 59\nBy specifyingτ> 0 then, the monetary authority would be saying,“if inﬂation\ndeviates from the neutral level, then the nominal interest rate will be increased\nrelative to the level which it would be at under a neutral monetary policy.” If\nthis statement is believed, then it may be enough to convince the private sector\nthat the inﬂation and output will actually take on its neutral level.\nThus, a substantial amount of work on the New IS-LM model has con-\ncerned ﬁnding the conditions which assure a unique equilibrium. Section 7\nbelow exempliﬁes this research. For the interest rate rule above, it shows that\none way of assuring a unique equilibrium is to have a strong positive response,\nτ> 1, as Kerr and King (1996) previously stressed. But, it also stresses that\n(i) a rule which speciﬁes a strong negative responses to current inﬂation may\nalso lead to a unique equilibrium, and (ii) that strong positive responses may\nlead to multiple equilibria if policy is forward looking.\n4. PRICE STICKINESS AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY\nMilton Friedman (1970, p. 49) focused attention on the importance of de-\ntermining how a change in nominal income is divided between responses of\nreal output and the price level at various horizons. In the New IS-LM model,\nchanges in monetary policy can affect real output because there is price stick-\niness of a sort long stressed in Keynesian macroeconomics. But since stick-\niness of prices is modeled in a New Keynesian manner — with pricing rules\nbased on ﬁrms’optimizing behavior— there are some novel implications for\nthe dynamics of real output and the price level.\nThe Structure of the New Phillips Curve\nThe New Keynesian research on aggregate supply was designed to produce\nan “an old wine in a new and more secure bottle ” by providing a better link\nbetween inﬂation and real activity, with microfoundations that earlier Keyne-\nsian theories lacked.16 Four key ideas are stressed in the twin volumes edited\nby Mankiw and Romer (1991) on this topic: costly price adjustment, asyn-\nchronous price adjustment, forward-looking price setting, and monopolistic\ncompetition.\nThese ideas have been implemented in a variety of applied macroeconomic\nmodels beginning with Taylor ’s (1980). All of these sticky price models\ncontain two central ingredients. First, since price adjustment does not take\nplace simultaneously for all ﬁrms, the price level is a weighted average of\ncurrent and past prices. Second, since ﬁrms have market power and recognize\nthat their nominal prices may be ﬁxed for some time, the models display a\n16 See Phelps and Taylor (1977), p. 166.\n60 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nricher, forward-looking pattern of price-setting than that which arises in the\nstandard, static monopoly pricing model.\nThese general ideas have been implemented in a variety of different ap-\nproaches to pricing. Models in the style of Taylor (1980) assume that ﬁrms\nadjust their prices every J periods, where J is assumed to be ﬁxed. Calvo\n(1983) proposed an alternative stochastic adjustment model, in which each\nﬁrm has a constant probability of being able to adjust its price every period.\nThe Calvo model has been incorporated into the New IS-LM model for four\nreasons. First, it seems to capture a key aspect of price dynamics at the level of\nindividual ﬁrms, which is that these involve discrete adjustments which occur\nat irregularly spaced intervals of time. Second, it leads to price level and price-\nsetting expressions which can be readily manipulated analytically. Third, this\napproach has provided a tractable base for recent studies which have provided\nempirical support for the New Keynesian approach to pricing.\n17 Fourth, it\nalso turns out to be observationally equivalent at the aggregate level to a pop-\nular alternative model of price adjustment— the quadratic cost of adjustment\nmodel for prices— as shown by Rotemberg (1987).\n18 At the same time, the\nCalvo and Taylor models are similar in the broad predictions developed in this\nsection, so that the increased tractability comes at a small apparent cost.\n19\nIn the Calvo model, the microeconomic extent of price stickiness is de-\ntermined by a single parameter, the probability that a ﬁrm will be unable\nto adjust its price in a given period, which will be called η.20 Since a\nﬁrm’s adjustment probabilities do not depend on the duration of its inter-\nval of price ﬁxity, there is a probability ηj of being stuck in period t + j\nwith the price that is set at t and the probability of ﬁrst adjusting in j peri-\nods is (1 − η)ηj−1. Accordingly, the expected duration of price stickiness is\n1(1 − η)+ 2(1 − η)η + ...(j + 1)(1 − η)ηj + ... = 1\nη, which depends on η\nin a convenient manner.\nThis degree of microeconomic stickiness plays a role in both the nature of\nthe price level and the nature of the pricing decision. In the model economy,\nthere are many, essentially identical ﬁrms which face stochastic individual\nopportunities to adjust prices. With a large number of ﬁrms in the economy,\n17 Recent interesting empirical studies of this approach include Roberts (1995), Gali and\nGertler (1999), and Sbordonne (1998).\n18 Rotemberg (1982) used the quadratic cost of adjustment model to study U.S. price dy-\nnamics. Generalizations of this approach, developed in Tinsley (1993) are employed in the Federal\nReserve System ’s new rational macroeconometric model.\n19 However, Wolman (2000) stresses that they can be quite different in some detailed impli-\ncations for price dynamics.\n20 This model is sometimes criticized on a number of grounds. First, the probability of being\nable to adjust price is independent of the time since the last price adjustment, so that ﬁrms face\nsome chance of being trapped with a ﬁxed price for a very long time. Second, the probability\nof price adjustment is exogenous. Dotsey, King, and Wolman (1999) study time-dependent and\nstate-dependent pricing that overcomes each of these objections.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 61\nthe fraction of ﬁrms adjusting price in a period is equal to the probability of\nprice adjustment (1 − η) and the fraction of ﬁrms stuck with a price that is j\nperiods old is (1 − η)ηj.\nA backward-looking price level: In general, the price level is an average\nof prices. In any model with staggered price-setting, some of these prices will\nbe newly set by ﬁrms which are adjusting prices and some will have been set\nin prior periods. Taking P\n∗\nt to be the price chosen by all adjusting ﬁrms in\nperiod t and Pt to be the price level as above, the following simple loglinear\nspeciﬁcation captures the idea that the price level is an average of prices:\nPt = (1 − η)\n∞∑\nj=0\nηjP∗\nt−j = ηPt−1 + (1 − η)P∗\nt . (11)\nThe second equality derives from the deﬁnition of the lagged price level: it is\na convenient expression for many analytical purposes. Notably, (11) can be\nrewritten as a partial adjustment mechanism,P\nt−Pt−1 = (1−η)[P∗\nt −Pt−1], so\nthat the price level responds only gradually whenP∗\nt is raised abovePt−1 with\nthe extent of price level adjustment just being the microeconomic probability\nof price adjustment.\nForward-looking price-setting: A key aspect of New Keynesian models\nis that ﬁrms know that their prices may be sticky in future periods. For this\nreason, they rationally consider future market conditions when they set prices.\nThe idea of forward-looking price-setting by ﬁrms may be captured with the\nspeciﬁcation\nP\n∗\nt = (1 − βη)\n∞∑\nj=0\n(βη)jEt[ψt+j + Pt] + xPt (12)\n= ηβEtP∗\nt+1 + (1 − βη)[ψt + Pt] + xPt − βηEtxP,t+1, (13)\nwhich can be developed from the Calvo model as in Rotemberg ’s survey of\nNew Keynesian macroeconomics (1987). The price chosen byﬁrms adjusting\nat date t, P∗\nt , is a distributed lead of nominal marginal cost (real marginal cost\nis ψt so that nominal marginal cost is ψt + Pt in this loglinear world). There\nare two parts to the discounting: β, which represents a conventional market\ndiscount factor (so that β is very close to, but less than one) and η, which\nreﬂects the fact thatﬁrms know that there is a lower probability of being stuck\nwith today’s price as they look further ahead. The shock xPt is a structural\nshock to the level of prices set by ﬁrms in period t and its relationship to the\ninﬂation shock introduced earlier in (3) will be determined later. The second\nline of (12) involves using the de ﬁnition of P∗\nt+1 to eliminate the distributed\nlead of future nominal marginal cost.\nThe forward-looking pricing rule (12) implies that a current change in\nnominal marginal cost affects P∗\nt very differently if it is expected to be per-\nmanent than if it is expected to be temporary. If nominal marginal cost is\n62 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nexpected to be the same in all future periods, then there is a one-for-one effect\nof its level on P∗\nt since (1 − βη) ∑ ∞\nj=0(βη)j = 1: a ﬁrm will raise its price\nproportionately if changes in marginal cost are expected to be permanent. By\ncontrast, P\n∗\nt will respond by a smaller amount, (1 − βη), if the change in\nmarginal cost is expected to be temporary, affecting only datet marginal cost.\nOutput and demand: New Keynesian macroeconomists stress that an op-\ntimizing, monopolistically competitive ﬁrm will rationally supply additional\noutput in response to an expansion of demand, rather than rationing customers,\nwhen its price is sticky (see, for example, Romer [1993]). This output response\nis pro ﬁtable so long as theﬁrm’s sticky nominal price is greater than its nom-\ninal marginal costs. The speci ﬁcation (3) assumes that this is true over the\nrange of disturbances considered in the New IS-LM model.\nA heroic assumption: To generate (3), a ﬁnal— heroic— assumption is\nneeded. In particular, assume that real marginal cost is positively related to\nthe output gap, with the parameterhbeing the elasticity of this response. That\nis,\nψ\nt = h(yt − yt). (14)\nThe parameter h is positive under conventional assumptions about the aggre-\ngate production function and factor supply elasticities. Real marginal cost\nwould necessarily rise with the level of economic activity if the economy had\nsome ﬁxed factors (such as a predetermined capital stock) or if higher real\nwage rates were necessary to induce workers to supply additional hours.\nThe speciﬁcation involves a shortcut that avoids modeling of the labor\nmarket, which is complicated, dif ﬁcult, and controversial. Some fully artic-\nulated models suggest that (14) is a useful approximation and also suggest\nparticular values of h. Others may suggest that this assumption is a weakness\nof the New IS-LM model.\nPutting the elements together: Combining (11), (12), and (14), as is done\nin Appendix A, leads to\nP\nt − Pt−1 = β(EtPt+1 − Pt) (15)\n+[h(1 − η)(1 − βη)\nη ](yt − yt)\n+(1 − η\nη )[xPt − βηEtxP,t+1].\nThis is identical to (3), but there is an explicit linking of the parameter ϕ =\nh(1−η)(1−βη)\nη to deeper parameters of the price adjustment process and the\nelasticity of marginal cost with respect to the output gap.21\n21 There is also a linking of the in ﬂation shock xπt to underlying shocks to the price setting\nequation xPt above, which is xπt = (1−η\nη )[xPt − βηEtxP,t+1]. This latter linkage is important\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 63\nLong-run neutrality: The form of the equation (15) highlights the fact\nthat a purely nominal disturbance, which permanently affects the level of\nprices at all dates by the same amount, will have no effect on the level of real\neconomic activity within the New IS-LM model. Speciﬁcally, if the price level\nis constant at all dates (E\ntPt+1 = Pt = Pt−1 = P) and there are no inﬂation\nshocks (xπt = 0), then output is equal to capacity (yt = yt).\nThe Nonneutrality of Nominal Shocks\nMany New Keynesian authors, including Taylor (1980) and Mankiw (1990),\nhave stressed that the new Phillips curve implies that nominal disturbances can\nhave effects on real economic activity because prices are sticky and output is\ndemand-determined. In this subsection, the implications of price stickiness for\nthe division of nominal income changes into prices and output are explored.\nImplications from analytical solutions for output and prices:Suppose that\nnominal income is exogenous and governed by the simple rule Y\nt − Yt−1 =\nρ(Yt−1 − Yt−2) + xYt with xYt being a series of “white noise” shocks.22 For\nsimplicity, assume that capacity is expected to be constant through time at y\nand that there are no price shocks.\nSince (15) is a much-studied second order expectational difference equa-\ntion, whose solution is reported in Appendix B of this article, it is easy to\ncompute the solution for the price level. The solution takes the form\nP\nt = θPt−1 + (1 − θ)(1 − βθ)\n∞∑\nj=0\n(βθ)jEt(Yt+j − y) (16)\n= θPt−1 + (1 − θ)(Yt−1 − y) + 1 − θ\n1 − θβρ (Yt − Yt−1)\nwhere θ is the smaller root of the equationβz2 −[1 +β+ϕ]z+1 = 0, which\nmay be shown to be between zero and one (see Appendix B). Further, since\ny\nt = Yt − Pt, the model’s implications for output are readily calculated\nyt − y = (θ 1 − βρ\n1 − θβρ )[Yt − Yt−1] + θ[yt−1 − y] (17)\nThere are several aspects of these solutions that warrant discussion. First,\nthe coefﬁcient θ provides one measure of the degree of gradual price level\nin terms of assessing the magnitude of in ﬂation shocks. If price shocks are independent through\ntime, as some theories of mistakes suggest, then xπt = (1−η\nη )xPt and with one-quarter of ﬁrms\nadjusting prices each period ( η = .75), then in ﬂation shocks will be only one-third as large as\nprice-setting errors.\n22 There are two alternative ways to rationalize this. One is that there is a strong form of\nthe quantity equation, with the money demand function (4) satisfying δ = 1 and γ = 0 and the\nmoney supply equation (5) taking the form Mt = xMt with xMt being a random walk. Another\nis that the monetary authority follows a monetary policy rule which makes nominal income equal\nto an exogenous random walk.\n64 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nadjustment at the macroeconomic level, since it indicates the extent to which\nthe past price level inﬂuences the current price level. This is different from the\nextent of price stickiness η at the microeconomic level, although increases in\nη lead to larger values of θ. In this example, θ is inﬂuenced by the elasticity\nof marginal costhas well asη.I f i nﬂation is more responsive to departures of\noutput from the capacity level, then the current price level becomes less sticky,\nin the sense that it is less dependent on the past price level. (More speciﬁcally,\nlower values of η or higher values of h lead to higher values of ϕ, which\nin turn make for smaller solutions for θ.) More generally, the importance of\npredetermined prices to the current price level depends on the structure of the\nentire macroeconomic model, i.e., it is a system property rather than a property\nof just the equations of the “price block”, such as (11) and (12).\n23\nSecond, the degree of gradual price level adjustment is important for the\npersistence of outputﬂuctuations: θ enters (16) as the coefﬁcient on the lagged\nprice level and enters (17) as the coef ﬁcient on the lagged output level. The\nsimplicity of this linkage re ﬂects the fact that nominal income is evolving\nexogenously in this model, but the general relationship between the extent of\ngradual price level adjustment and the degree of output persistence also carries\nover to richer setups.\nThird, when the growth rate of nominal income is white noise (so that the\nlevel of nominal income is a random walk), then θ also controls the split of\na change in nominal income between output and the price level. If prices are\nmore sticky, then nominal income changes have a greater effect on real output.\nFourth, when the growth rate of nominal income becomes more persistent,\nthen there is a larger effect of a surprise nominal income change on the price\nlevel and a correspondingly smaller one on output. In fact, if the changes\nin nominal income growth are permanent (ρ = 1) and market discounting is\nsmall (β = 1) then the coef ﬁcient on Y\nt − Yt−1 in the price level equation\n(16) becomes one and the coef ﬁcient in the output equation (17) becomes\nzero. In this limiting situation, there is neutrality independent of the degree\nof underlying price stickiness or the value of θ which is the indicator of the\ngradual adjustment of the price level.\nImplications from simulated responses to an increase in nominal income:\nFigure 2 highlights some implications of (3) and a similar ﬁgure will be used\nlater to highlight some implications of the full New IS-LM model. In con-\nstructing these ﬁgures, the time unit is taken to be one quarter of a year, which\nis a conventional macroeconomic modeling interval. The response of the price\n23 For this reason, it is affected by other parameters of the New IS-LM model when the full\nmodel is solved, as in Section 8 below.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 65\nFigure 2\n66 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nlevel and output will be measured in percentage points and the responses of\ninﬂation rates and interest rates will be measured in percent per annum.24\nThe solid line in panel b of Figure 2 shows the (impulse) response of output\nto an unexpected and permanent one percent increase in nominal income which\ntakes place at date 0. Given that nominal income is exogenously one percent\nhigher and since y = Y − P, the path for output is a mirror image of the\npath for prices: output is high when prices are low relative to the level of\nnominal income. On impact, output rises by 0 <θ< 1 percent, with the\nﬁgure constructed under the assumption that θ = .20.\n25 The price level rises\nby 0 <( 1 −θ)< 1 percent, with theﬁgure constructed under the assumption\nthat 1 − θ = .8.\nIn subsequent periods, the price level gradually adjusts up to its new higher\nlong-run level, while output falls back toward the capacity level. The speed\nof adjustment is again given by the value of θ. There is an output effect of θ\npercent in the ﬁrst period, θ\n2 in the second period, and so forth.\nThe inﬂation rate is shown by the solid line in panel c of Figure 2 and is\ngiven mathematically by differencing (16) under the assumption that ρ = 0,\nwhich results in πt = θπt−1 + (1 − θ)(xleltanYt − xleltany).26 This is exactly the\nsame solution as for the level of the output gap, so that a crude Phillips curve\nrelationship of the form π\nt = (1−θ\nθ )(yt − y) would work perfectly in this\neconomy, given the assumed driving process. More generally, under a variety\nof driving processes, the model predicts that a rising price level (in ﬂation) is\npositively associated with high output (relative to capacity).\n27 In this sense,\nthe model can generate a traditional empirical Phillips correlation between\ninﬂation and real activity.\nPersistent Output Effects\nMany empirical studies suggest that business cycles arising from nominal dis-\nturbances display considerable persistence, lasting for many quarters. Taylor\n(1980) and other New Keynesian macroeconomists have suggested that price\nstickiness can lead to persistent effects of various disturbances on output.\n24 These conventional measurement choices will require some care when comparisons are\nmade across the panels of the ﬁgures, as discussed further below.\n25 This value of θ obtains when β = .99 and ϕ = .05, which are the parameter values used\nin sections below.\n26 Since the in ﬂation rate is stated at an annualized percentage rate of change, the .2 per-\ncentage point increase in the price level (shown in panel a of Figure 2) that occurs at the initial\ndate corresponds to a 4 ∗ .2 = .8 rise in the annualized in ﬂation rate at the initial date (shown\nin panel c of Figure 2). By contrast, all of the mathematical relationships described in the text\nand appendices involve the quarterly in ﬂation rate, i.e., the percentage change in the price level\nbetween t − 1 and t.\n27 In particular, (17) implies that πt = 1−θ\nθ\n1−βρ\n1−θβρ (yt − y). Thus, the slope of the Phillips\ncurve depends negatively on the persistence of nominal income growth.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 67\nIf persistent business cycles arise from changes in nominal income then (3)\nimplies that nominal income must itself be persistent.28\nTo illustrate this point, (16) can be used to recompute the solution for the\nprice level in the case of purely temporary variations in nominal income:\nPt = θPt−1 + (1 − θ)(1 − βθ)(Yt − y)\nand the comparable solution for output is\nyt − y = [(1 − (1 − θ)(1 − θβ)][Yt − y]\n+θ[yt−1 − y] − θ[Yt−1 − y].\nThus, the effect of a purely temporary change in aggregate demand is to raise\nthe price level somewhat and to raise output considerably on impact. But in\nsubsequent periods, the economy will be stuck with a price level above its\nlong-run level and have a smaller than capacity level of output. These dynam-\nics are the dashed lines in panels a–c of Figure 2. In the impact period, the rise\nin nominal income produces a large increase in real output and a small increase\nin the price level, because price-setters correctly understand that the increase\nin nominal income is temporary. These analytical and simulation results high-\nlight the fact that the pricing dynamics underlying the New Keynesian Phillips\ncurve (3) do not themselves make business cycles persistent.\n29\n5. LONG-RUN LIMITS ON MONETARY POLICY\nWhile allowing for short-run effects of nominal income on output, the New\nIS-LM model embodies the idea— put forward by Friedman (1968) and Phelps\n(1967)— that the monetary authority cannot engineer permanent departures of\noutput from its capacity level. This idea was formalized in an earlier generation\nof rational expectations macromodels and is sometimes described as involving\na vertical long-run Phillips curve. For this reason, this section considers the\nlong-run limits on monetary policy under some alternative speci ﬁcations of\naggregate supply, ending with a discussion of the relationship in the New\nIS-LM model.\nThe Price Surprise Supply Curve\nA previous generation of IS-LM macromodels incorporated an alternative\n“expectations augmented” Phillips curve (notably, see Sargent and Wallace\n28 But, as discussed above, its growth rate cannot be too persistent or there will be no effect\nof a surprise change.\n29 Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2000) question whether even permanent movements in the\nmoney stock can cause persistent movements in output. In terms of the present model, they do\nso by imposing restrictions on η and h.\n68 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\n[1975] and McCallum [1989]). In particular, these models used an aggregate\nsupply curve of the “price surprise” form\nyt − yt = l(Pt − Et−1Pt), (18)\nwhere l is a positive parameter that governs the inﬂuence of increases in prices\non output. This aggregate supply curve was rationalized by Lucas (1972a,\n1973) as arising from incomplete information on the part of suppliers and by\nPhelps and Taylor (1977) as arising from sticky prices.\nBy subtracting the past price level from both P\nt and Et−1Pt, an expecta-\ntional Phillips curve quite similar to (3) can be derived:\nπt = Et−1πt + 1\nl (yt − yt). (19)\nModern presentations of aggregate supply theory— such as those in the text-\nbooks referenced above — stress two implications of (18) or (19) that were\ndeveloped in the 1970s. First, if there is surprise expansion of demand —\ntaken as in Section 4.2 to be an increase in nominal output y + P— then\nthere is an increase in both output and the price level, with the split between\nthese depending on the size of the supply elasticityl. Thus, there is a positive\nrelationship between inﬂation and output when there are shocks to nominal de-\nmand, i.e., a short-run correlation of the form discovered by Phillips. Second,\nany expected expansion of demand would raise expected and actual inﬂation\nby the same amount, thus neutralizing the real consequences.\n30 Thus, there is\nno long-run Phillips curve and the position of the short-run Phillips curve (in\nπ, y\nt space as in Figure 1) shifts with the expected rate of inﬂation.\nThe Long-run Effect of Inﬂation\nThe analysis of Section 4.2 demonstrated a similar link between temporary\nmovements in inﬂation and output for the New IS-LM model’s Phillips curve\n(3), πt = βEtπt+1 + ϕ(yt − yt). To explore the long-run implications in the\nnew model, suppose that the economy is in an in ﬂationary steady-state with\nπt = Etπt+1 = π. Then, output will be\nyt = yt + 1 − β\nϕ π\nso that we can say that the “long-run slope ” of the Phillips curve is 1−β\nϕ .\nThis slope measures the response of output to changes in the long-run rate of\n30 More speci ﬁcally, the response of output can be calculated as follows. First, it is direct\nfrom (18) that Et−1yt = Et−1yt, i.e., that the economy is expected to be at capacity each period.\nSecond, the response of real output can be calculated by using Yt −Et−1Yt = (Pt −Et−1Pt)+(yt −\nEt−1yt) together with (18) to determine that Pt −Et−1Pt = 1\n1+l (Yt −Et−1Yt) and yt −Et−1yt =\nl\n1+l (Yt − Et−1Yt).\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 69\ninﬂation, after the economy has made a transition from one inﬂationary steady\nstate to another. With β close to unity, then, (3) implies there is a negligible\nlong-run slope to the Phillips curve.\nExperiments with fully articulated models — such as that constructed by\nKing and Wolman (1996)— suggest that the effect of inﬂation on output rela-\ntive to capacity is very small.31 Accordingly, the conditionβ = 1 is imposed in\nthe remainder of this section. The fully articulated models provide this quan-\ntitative result because (i) ﬁrms do not allow sustained inﬂation to have much\neffect on their monopoly pro ﬁts and (ii) households do not allow sustained\ninﬂation to have much effect on their factor supply.\n32\nEstimating the Long-run Effect\nLucas (1972b) and Sargent (1971) showed that it was a subtle matter to estimate\nthe long-run effect if the economy possessed an economy with an aggregate\nsupply equation of the form (18) or a price equation of the form (19).\n33\nEarlier, Gordon (1970) and Solow (1969) had proposed to estimate the\nlong-run slope by specifying a hybrid model that nested expectational and\nnonexpectational forms of the Phillips curve. A simple form of this hybrid\nempirical model is\nπ\nt = gEt−1πt + ϕ(yt − yt).\nWith g< 1, this speciﬁcation would imply a long effect of inﬂation on output,\nwith a slope of 1−g\nγ > 0. Solow and Gordon estimated this speciﬁcation using\nadaptive expectations proxies for Et−1πt, with the simplest variant of their\nprocedure assigning Et−1πt = πt−1. In general, these studies found g to be\nsigniﬁcantly less than one through the 1970s.\nLucas and Sargent argued that this procedure wasﬂawed in a setting with\nrational expectations. To illustrate their point, suppose that πt = ρπt−1 + et\nwith ρ< 1. Then the rational expectations solution for in ﬂation is πt =\nρπt−1 + ϕ(yt − yt). Application of the Solow-Gordon method would thus\nestimate that g = ρ< 1. Therefore, as stressed by Lucas and Sargent, the\nreduced form relationship would indicate an exploitable long-run trade-off,\nwith a 1 percent higher in ﬂation rate yielding\n1−ρ\nϕ percentage points higher\noutput, even though no tradeoff was actually present.\n31 The closely related model of Yun (1996) eliminates effects of sustained in ﬂation by es-\nsentially allowing ﬁrms to index their nominal prices by the trend in ﬂation rate.\n32 There is a subtlety here, in that sticky price models built up from micro foundations\ncan imply that there is a small effect of in ﬂation on the volume of physical output — a quantity\naggregate— while there is a larger effect of in ﬂation on the value that households place on this\noutput, due to relative price distortions that emerge when prices are sticky.\n33 Lucas (1972b) worked with a supply schedule, while Sargent (1971) worked with a wage\nequation.\n70 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nThe Phillips curve (3) in the New IS-LM model also implies that there is\nthis set of problems. Supposing as above that πt = ρπt−1 + et with ρ< 1\nto illustrate this point, it follows that (3) implies that πt = ϕ\n1−ρ (yt − yt).A n\neconometrician conducting Solow and Gordon ’s test would estimate g = 0\nand calculate that a 1 percent higher inﬂation rate would yield 1−ρ\nϕ percentage\npoints of output.34\nOverall, the New IS-LM model thus embodies the consensus among\nmacroeconomists that there is little long-run trade-off between in ﬂation and\nreal activity. It also suggests, as did earlier rational expectations for IS-LM\nmodels, that the existence of a short-run Phillips curve could mislead applied\neconometricians and central bankers into believing that there is a long-run\ntrade-off.\nDisinﬂation Dynamics\nIn terms of permanent changes in the in ﬂation rate, such as that engineered\nby the Federal Reserve System during the “V olcker deﬂation” of 1979–1983\nand more recently by other central banks around the world, there are some\nvery classical implications of the Phillips curve, stressed by Buiter and Miller\n(1985), that is incorporated in the New IS-LM model. While these implications\nare not strictly the limits on monetary policy which are the focus of this section,\nthey are related to the shifts in trend inﬂation considered here.\nWithin the “surprise” form of the Phillips curve, which developed from\nLucas’s (1973) analysis, there is only a one-time real effect of an unanticipated,\npermanent, and credible change in the in ﬂation rate since (19) implies that\nπ\nt = Et−1πt+1\nl (yt−yt). To illustrate this point, suppose that the inﬂation rate\nis governed by the random walk speciﬁcation, πt = πt−1 + et, which implies\nthat all in ﬂation changes are unexpected and permanent. Then, Et−1πt =\nπt−1 and a decline in the date t rate of inﬂation causes an output decline of\n(yt − yt) = let with no expected consequences for future output.\nThe new Phillips curve (3) has a related, but stronger implication: There\nis no effect of an unanticipated, permanent and credible shift in the in ﬂation\nrate since πt = Etπt+1 in this case and the above analysis (with β = 1) that\nchanges in the trend rate of in ﬂation have no effect on real activity. 35 Ball\n(1995) emphasizes the importance of policy credibility to this implication of\nsnap disinﬂation.\n34 The assumption of exogenous in ﬂation is simply for analytical convenience: a similar spuri-\nous long-run tradeoff appears, as in Section 4.2, when the model is solved with exogenous nominal\nincome.\n35 A slight modi ﬁcation of the structure of the current model — requiring that ﬁrms post prices\nprior to receiving information about date t— is employed in Bernanke and Woodford (1997). This\nhas the implication that πt = Et−1πt+1 + ϕ(yt − yt) so its has the same implication for an\nunanticipated, permanent disin ﬂation as does (19).\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 71\n6. THE NEW IS CURVE\nIn this section, three aspects of the new IS curve are discussed. Section 6.1\nexplains the role of expected future output in the new IS curve. Section 6.2\nconsiders the implications of omitting expectational terms for traditional IS\nspeciﬁcations. Section 6.3 discusses two key implications of the new IS curve,\nthe natural rate of interest and the cyclical behavior of the real interest rate,\nwhich can be obtained without full solution of the New IS-LM model.\nTo begin, let’s return to panel a of Figure 1, which may be viewed as the\nfamiliar, traditional IS curve. In this graph, a higher real interest rate leads to\na lower level of aggregate demand. Given that output is demand-determined\nand the economy under study is closed, a higher rate thus leads to a lower level\nof output/income. The negative slope of this speciﬁcation reﬂects the idea that\nan increase in income is partly saved by households, with a lower real interest\nrate required to stimulate additional investment. The traditional IS curve is\nviewed as fairly steep by many economists, who believe that large changes in\ninterest rates are necessary to produce macroeconomically important changes\nin aggregate demand. This steep slope corresponds to a small value of s in\n(1).\n36\nThe new IS curve also implies a negative relationship between interest rates\nand output, holdingﬁxed expected inﬂation and expected future output. In this\nsense, the New IS-LM model is very traditional. As stressed by McCallum\nand Nelson (1999b), it is also very traditional in that no asset stocks— neither\nthe capital stock nor the quantity of real balances — enter anywhere in these\nspeciﬁcations.\nBut it also predicts that shifts in expectations about future output can be\na very important determinant of the level of aggregate demand. For example,\nif output is expected to be 1 percent higher in the future, then the new IS\nspeciﬁcation implies that aggregate demand will be 1 percent higher today.\nImportance of Expected Future Output\nThe potential importance of this expectations effect raises two related ques-\ntions. First, why is the new IS curve written as in (1), rather than as yt =\nχEtyt+1 − srt + xdt with χ being a parameter governing the size of these\nexpectations effects? Second, is the actual behavior of income likely to mean\nthat there is an important difference between the two speciﬁcations?\nRationalizing the unit coefﬁcient on E\ntyt+1: Total demand in a closed\neconomy involves consumption, investment, and government components. In\n36 The traditional view that the IS schedule is relatively interest-inelastic also means that\nmany economists have downplayed the importance of shifts in expected in ﬂation for aggregate\ndemand, since the effect of these is captured by sEtπt+1 in (1). Without taking a stand on the\ninterest-elasticity of aggregate demand, the present discussion therefore downplays this channel.\n72 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nthe United States and most other economies, consumption is by far the largest\npart of this demand. The modern theory of consumption, developed by Hall\n(1978, 1988) and others along the linesﬁrst sketched by Irving Fisher, implies\nthat an intertemporally efﬁcient consumption plan equates the cost of foregone\nconsumption today and the bene ﬁts of increased future consumption. More\nspeciﬁcally, Hall (1978) shows that ef ﬁcient consumption growth should be\npositively related to the real interest rate. If we let c\nt be the logarithm of\nconsumption, Hall’s ﬁnding suggests that the dominant component demand\nshould obey\nEtct+1 − ct = s[rt − r],\nwhich alternatively implies that\nct = Etct+1 − s[rt − r].\nTo simply apply the consumption equation to total demand, it is necessary\nto make one of two assumptions: either consumption is assumed to be all of\naggregate demand, or the residual components of demand move exactly with\ntotal demand or consumption.\n37 Neither of these is likely to be true exactly,\nwith investment being proportionately more volatile than total demand and\ngovernment purchases being proportionately less volatile. While government\ndemand may not be forward looking, neoclassical investment theory suggests\nthat expectations about future output will be a very important determinant of\ncurrent investment, with potentially much larger effects than are present in\nconsumption. Overall, though, the consumption theory makes (1), with a unit\ncoefﬁcient, the natural ﬁrst approximation to the forward-looking theory of\naggregate demand.\nImplications for the Traditional IS Curve\nSuppose that there was really a new IS curve of the form (1), but that a\nmacroeconomic analyst worked with a traditional IS curve.\nInstability and lags in the traditional IS Curve: Written in terms of the\nnominal interest rate and organized so as to facilitate comparison with the\ntraditional IS curve, the new IS curve is\ny\nt =− sRt +{ [Etyt+1 + sEtπt+1] + xdt }.\nThe term [ Etyt+1 + sEtπt+1] + xdt combines the actual aggregate demand\nshock xdt with the expectational elements that are omitted in the traditional\napproach.\n37 Woodford (1996) and Dotsey, King, and Wolman (1999) are examples of economies in\nwhich (a) there is no capital or investment and (b) there are separability restrictions on preferences;\nthese conditions guarantee that there is exactly an IS curve of the form (1). McCallum and Nelson\n(1999) detail the necessary separability conditions. They also argue that (1) is a good approximation\nto an economy with investment because there is a small cyclical variation in the capital stock.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 73\nThere are thus two key implications. First, if output and inﬂation expecta-\ntions are substantially variable, there will be large shifts in the position of the\ntraditional IS curve. Second, variables that are useful for forecasting E\ntyt+1\nand Etπt+1 will improve the empiricalﬁt of a traditional IS curve: since both\noutput and inﬂation display important persistence empirically, lagged values\nof these variables can enter.38\nThe long-term interest rate and the traditional IS Curve:Many economists\nbelieve that the long-term interest rate is more important for aggregate demand\nthan the short-term interest rate (see, for example, Goodfriend [1998]). The\nnew IS curve also helps explain why long-term interest rates can appear more\nimportant in practice even if it is the short-term interest rate that is behaviorally\nrelevant for certain parts of aggregate demand. For this purpose, let’s assume\nthat the expectations theory of the term structure holds exactly, without a\nterm premium, so that the n period real interest rate is r\nn\nt = 1\nn[rt + Etrt+1 +\n...E trt+n−1]. Let ’s also assume that output is expected to be equal to its\ncapacity level after n periods. Then, iterating the new IS curve, output can be\nshown to be\nyt =− srt + Etyt+1 + xdt\n=− s[rt + Etrt+1 + ...E trt+n−1] + Etyt+n + xdt\n=− σrn\nt + Etyt+n + xdt\nwith σ = sn. Thus, the implied coef ﬁcient on the long rate is much larger\nthan s and the ﬁt of this expression should be much better because there is no\nlonger the omitted variableEtyt+1. Each of these implications occurs because\nthe long-term real interest rate“stands in” for the inﬂuence of expected future\noutput Etyt+1.\nPersistence of output and the importance of expectations effects:Macroe-\nconomists agree that ﬂuctuations in output are highly persistent, even though\nthere is disagreement about the precise extent of this persistence. Persistence\nin output makes it possible to forecast output, which in turn means that there\nare important variations in theE\ntyt+1 term on the right hand side of (1). Yet it\nis only if output variations are close to temporary that there is little practical\ndifference between the new and old IS schedules.\nInterest Rate Implications\nThe new IS curve also embodies two modern ideas about the link between the\nreal interest rate and real economic activity.\n38 The new IS curve also can explain why empirical researchers have found it hard to isolate\neffects of interest rates on aggregate demand. Shifts in expected income and interest rates should\nbe correlated with nominal interest rates, leading to biased estimates of the interest sensitivity s.\n74 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nThe natural rate of interest: If the economy is operating at its capacity\nlevel of output, then there is a particular level of the real interest rate which\none may call the natural rate of interest. The new IS curve indicates that this\nnatural rate of interest is given by\nrt = 1\ns[Etyt+1 − yt + xdt ].\nThus, the natural rate of interest rises when the capacity level of output is\nexpected to grow more rapidly. It also rises if there are shocks to demand at a\ngiven real interest rate. If there is a steep IS curve (small s) then the required\nincrease in the real interest rate for a given growth rate of capacity output or\ndemand shock is larger.\nThe real interest rate and the business cycle:The new IS schedule implies\nthat the real interest rate also rises, more generally, when output growth is\nexpected to be higher:\nr\nt = 1\ns[Etyt+1 − yt + xdt ].\nThus, the new IS curve implies that an economy recovering from a temporarily\nlow level of output— one which has a high expected growth rate— would have\na high real interest rate. A low real interest rate would be associated with an\neconomy experiencing a temporarily high level of output. This implication\nwill be very useful in interpreting the comovement of the real interest rate with\ncyclical ﬂuctuations in output in Section 8.\n7. LIMITS ON INTEREST RATE RULES\nThere has been substantial recent research on interest rate rules, since these\nstrategies appear to describe some aspects of the actual instrument choice and\npolicy actions of the Federal Reserve System (Goodfriend 1991, Taylor 1993).\nSpeciﬁcally, Taylor (1993) studied the properties of an interest rate rule of the\nform\nT : R\nt = [r + π] + τπ(πt − π) + τy(yt − yt), (20)\nwhere r is the steady state real interest rate, π is the long-run in ﬂation, and\nyt − yt is the deviation of output from capacity.39\nTaylor proposed that a relatively aggressive response to inﬂation was im-\nportant; in particular, he suggested that the FRS should raise the nominal\ninterest rate more than one-for-one in response to in ﬂation τ\nπ > 1. He also\nsuggested that the central bank should lower the nominal interest rate when\noutput was less than capacity, thus implying a positive value forτ\ny.\n39 In Taylor’s (1993) setting, the in ﬂation measure was a four quarter average, but the current\ndiscussion will follow the recent literature in representing this as the current quarterly in ﬂation rate.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 75\nIn work on the consequences of alternative interest rate rules within the\nNew IS-LM model and related fully articulated models, it is common for the\nspace of policy rule parameters to be divided into two parts. In the ﬁrst part\nof the parameter space, which is extensively studied, there is a unique stable\nrational expectations equilibrium. In the second part, which is avoided, there\nare multiple stable equilibria. This section describes how multiple equilibria\ncan arise under an interest rate rule. It derives some standard restrictions on\nthe parameters of an interest rate policy rule — some of which turn out to be\nrelated to τ\nπ > 1— that lead to a unique stable equilibrium.40\nThe main focus of this section, however, is on the more speciﬁc question\nraised in Section 2 above: What restrictions on an interest rate rule must\nbe imposed if the central bank seeks to obtain a neutral path of economic\nactivity— of real output, in ﬂation, and interest rates — as a unique outcome?\nTo aid us in answering this question, the monetary policy rule is speciﬁed as\nR\nt = Rt + τ1(Etπt+1 − Etπt+1) + τ0(πt − πt) + xRt. (21)\nThe ﬁrst term in this expression is the neutral interest rate, i.e., the level of\nthe nominal interest rate under a neutral policy. As discussed above, the\nneutral nominal rate involves the sum of the natural real rate of interest and\nthe expected future in ﬂation target,\nRt = Rt + Etπt+1. The rule (21) also\nspeciﬁes that the monetary authority adjusts the nominal interest rate relative\nto its neutral level Rt = rt + Etπt+1 if there are current or expected future\ndepartures of inﬂation from the targeted levels. This is in keeping with the spirit\nof Taylor’s rule, involving deviations from normal values, but is appropriate for\na setup with a stochastically varying neutral path of inﬂation and real activity.\nIt is a convenient choice for this article because (i) it contains a number of\nspecial cases which been studied previously in the literature, and (ii) it makes\nit easy to determine the restrictions on an interest rate policy rule that lead to\na unique equilibrium under the neutral interest rate policy, which was the key\nquestion raised in Section 2.\n41\n40 There are two concerns which are frequently expressed about interest rate rules. First,\nthere is a long branch of literature in monetary economics which suggests that interest rate rules\ncan mean that there is not a unique equilibrium in macroeconomic models. Second, there is\nthe concern of Friedman (1982) that an interest rate rule can lead the central bank to exacerbate\nmacroeconomic ﬂuctuations which arise from shocks to productive opportunities, changes in money\ndemand, and so forth. The discussion in this section will be restricted to the former concern: If\nthe central bank is responding to in ﬂation and output as suggested by Taylor, when do interest\nrate rules lead to a unique outcome? But the second question is an open and important topic.\n41 The speci ﬁcation of this rule leads to a subtle shift in the interpretation of the policy\nparameters τi; these involve specifying how the monetary authority will respond to deviations of\ninﬂation from target. But if these parameters are chosen so that there is a unique equilibrium,\nthen no deviations of in ﬂation will ever occur.\nAt the same time, the parameter restrictions developed here would also apply to a rule of\nthe general form originally studied by Taylor, i.e.,\nRt = r + π + τ1(Etπt+1 − π) + τ0(πt − π) + xRt.\n76 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nPotential Multiple Equilibria\nIt is useful to start by considering a simple, ﬂexible price setup in which the\nmonetary authority can affect the behavior of inﬂation but not the behavior of\nthe real rate of interest. Suppose that the authority adopts the rule\nRt = rt + π + τ(π t − π) + xRt, (22)\nwhere π is a constant trend rate of in ﬂation and τ governs the response of\ninﬂation to deviations from this level, which is a simpliﬁcation of the two rules\ndiscussed above. Since the Fisher equation speci ﬁes that Rt = rt + Etπt+1,\nit follows that inﬂation is constrained by\nτ[πt − π] + xRt = [Etπt+1 − π]. (23)\nIf τ> 1, which is the case normally considered, then the unique stable rational\nexpectations solution to this difference equation can be obtained by recursively\nsolving the difference equation forward\nπ\nt − π = 1\nτ {[Etπt+1 − π] − xRt}\n= 1\nτ {[ 1\nτ ((Etπt+2 − π) − xR,t+1)] − xRt}\nand so forth until one concludes that42\nπt − π =− {\n∞∑\nj=0\n(1\nτ )j+1Etxt+j}. (24)\nThis unique stable solution makes in ﬂation into a present value of expected\nmonetary policy shocks.43\nThis is because the difference between these two rules is\nRt − (r + π) + τ1(Etπt+1 − π) + τ0(πt − π)\nwhich is just a complicated “shock” term that depends on exogenous variables.\n42 At the end of this process, one uses lim j→∞(1\nτ )jEtxR,t+j = 0, which surely obtains\nbecause τ> 1 and xR,t is stationary.\n43 There are some puzzling aspects of this ﬂexible price solution, which implies that the\nbehavior of the nominal interest rate is\nRt = rt + π −{\n∞∑\nj=0\n(1\nτ )jEtxt+j}+ xRt.\nThat is, when an xt shock occurs so that the central bank ’s chosen path is autonomously increased,\nthen in ﬂation must move to offset this response. For example, if xt is serially uncorrelated, then\ninﬂation moves just enough so that the nominal rate is unresponsive to the shock (in this case\n−{∑ ∞\nj=0(1\nτ )jEtxt+j}=− xt so that the interest rate is just Rt = rt + π). For another example,\nif xt is autoregressive with persistence parameter ρ, then the nominal interest rate must actually\nfall in response to a positive policy shock.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 77\nBy contrast, if 0 <τ< 1, there are multiple stable rational expectations\nsolutions, which take the form\nπt+1 − π = τ[πt − π] + xRt + ξt+1 (25)\nwith ξt+1 being an arbitrary random variable with Etξt+1 = 0. These non-\nfundamental stochastic elements are sometimes referred to as “sunspots” or\n“animal spirits.”44 Mathematically, they can enter in (25) because the perfect\nforesight solution displays an indeterminacy: any initial value of π0 can be\nan equilibrium with the remainder of the stable perfect foresight equilibrium\npath being π\nt+1 − π = τt+1(π0 − π). From this perspective, the ξt+1 can be\ninterpreted as a randomly shifting set of initial conditions for the stochastic\ndifference equation.\nEconomically, the equilibria described by (25) can be too volatile relative\nto the fundamental forces in the model economy. For example, even if thex\nRt\nshocks are absent, inﬂation under such a policy rule can be arbitrarily volatile\nsince the variance ofξ is arbitrary.45 These multiple equilibria arise for a basic\neconomic reason introduced in Section 2, which is the that the central bank’s\npolicy rule does not provide a sufﬁcient nominal anchor.\nTherefore, a simple ﬂexible price model indicates that there could be a\ngood reason for interest rate rules to be restricted to aggressive values of\nparameters, in line with Taylor ’s (1993) suggestion that τ> 1. The simple\nmodel also indicates, however, that there are other parameter choices which\nwill lead to uniqueness. In particular, if the monetary authority aggressively\nlowers the rate in response to inﬂation (makesτ< −1), then there will also be\na unique equilibrium since the same logic employed in the derivation of (24)\nmay be employed. Thus, in the simple ﬂexible price model there is a “zone\nof indeterminacy” which includes all policy rules with −1 <τ< 1.\n46\nLimits in the New IS-LM Model\nIn models with sticky prices, it is sometimes argued that there is a greater\nlatitude for interest rate policies than in ﬂexible price models. The New IS-\nLM model is simple enough that one can characterize analytically the parts of\nthe parameter space in which there are unique equilibria and the parts in which\n44 Farmer (1999) has recently argued that understanding the effects of nonfundamental un-\ncertainties of this form is very important for macroeconomics, echoing earlier assertions of Jevons\nand Keynes.\n45 Another, less stressed, implication is that a shock which increases the nominal interest rate\nwill raise the in ﬂation rate under this solution.\n46 With recent interest in the analysis of alternative interest rate rules under rational expecta-\ntions, within the New IS-LM model and related fully articulated models, economists are beginning\nto explore new territory in terms of coef ﬁcients in interest rate rules within quantitative models\n(as in the recent volume of studies edited by Taylor [1999]).\n78 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nFigure 3\nR.

King: New IS-LM Model 79\nthere are multiple equilibria. 47 However, modern literature on the design of\nmonetary policy rules, as exempliﬁed by the recent volume edited by Taylor\n(1999), typically proceeds by using graphical presentations of these rules, with\nsome regions blocked out as“zones of indeterminacy.” Figure 3 is an example\nof this approach for the New IS-LM model, with some various versions of the\ngeneral policy rule.\nResponse to the current inﬂation rate:Kerr and King (1996) used the New\nIS-LM model to study the case in which the central bank responds only to the\ncurrent inﬂation rate.\n48 In panel a, the shaded region is the set of inadmissable\nsettings for the response to current inﬂation (τ0) given that there is no response\nto expected inﬂation (τ1 = 0). As suggested by Taylor (1993) and the analysis\nof the ﬂexible price model above, one boundary of the zone of indeterminacy\nis given by τ0 = 1, which was the restriction also focused on by Kerr and\nKing. The ﬁgure implies that any rule of the form (21) withτ1 = 0 andτ1 > 1\nis consistent with neutral behavior of output and in ﬂation. Thus, in terms of\nthe answer to the question raised in Section 2, the analysis indicates that there\nwill be a unique equilibrium if the monetary says, “If inﬂation deviates from\nthe neutral level, then the nominal interest rate will be increased by more than\none-for-one relative to the level which it would be at under a neutral monetary\npolicy.”\nIn the New IS-LM model, in contrast to conventional wisdom, the sticki-\nness of prices implies that there is a larger zone of indeterminacy than in the\nﬂexible price model. This feature of the model was not stressed by Kerr and\nKing because they did not focus on the lower boundary of the zone, which\ncan be determined to be τ\n0 =− 2(1+β)\nϕs − 1. Hence, as prices become more\nﬂexible or the IS curve becomes ﬂatter— there is a larger value of ϕs— then\nthe result approaches the boundary in theﬂexible price model ofτ0 =− 1,but\nthe zone of indeterminacy is always larger with sticky prices. The monetary\nauthority, however, may also insure a unique equilibrium by saying that it will\nvery aggressively lower the inﬂation rate in response to deviations of inﬂation\nfrom its target.\nResponse to the expected inﬂation rate: Bernanke and Woodford (1997)\nstudied a purely forward-looking rule in which τ\n0 = 0, which is the case\nillustrated in panel b of Figure 2. With a response to expected in ﬂation (but\nno response to current in ﬂation), there are two zones of indeterminacy. All\npolicy responses with τ1 < 1 are precluded, so it is necessary for policy to be\n47 Appendix C contains a detailed discussion of these regions. The approach is to (i) ﬁnd\nthe boundaries of the regions by learning when there are roots which are ±1 and (ii) determine\nwhich regions are zones of indeterminacy.\n48 Comparison with Kerr and King (1996) highlights a feature of the current analysis. The\nearlier paper was concerned with rules of the form Rt = r + π + τ(π t − π) so that the focus\nwas on how the central bank should respond to deviations of in ﬂation from a constant target. The\ncurrent analysis focuses on deviations from a neutral in ﬂation target.\n80 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\naggressive in Taylor’s sense if it is forward looking. It is important, though,\nthat it not be too aggressive, since the ﬁgure shows that some larger values\nare also ruled out because these lead to indeterminacies (the precise boundary\nis τ\n1 > 1 + 2(1+β)\nϕs ).49 Forward-looking rules, then, suggest a very different\npattern of restrictions are necessary to assure that there is a neutral level of\noutput.\nResponse to both current and expected inﬂation: When the policy rule\ncombines a mixture of current and expected in ﬂation responses, there is a\nmore complicated set of possibilities. In general, the results are closer to\nthose in panel a when the forward-looking part of policy is not aggressive\n(τ\n1 < 1) and closer to panel b when it is aggressive (τ1 > 1).\nFor example, suppose that policy is mildly forward-looking, which is\nillustrated in panel c under the assumption thatτ1 is set equal to .25. The key\nimplication of the ﬁgure is that policy can then respond less aggressively to\ncurrent inﬂation. There is now a larger range of admissable positiveτ0 values,\nin the sense that values of τ0 < 1 lead to unique equilibria when they did not\nin panel a.\nIf monetary policy is to respond positively to both current and expected\ninﬂation, however, then it is necessary that the overall policy be aggressive.\nThe upper boundary of the zone of indeterminacy is given byτ0 + τ1 = 1, so\nthat τ0 >. 75 leads to a unique equilibrium in the graph.50 Still, by responding\npartially to expected future inﬂation, monetary policy makes it less necessary\nto respond aggressively to current inﬂation.\nIf one takes all of these results together, one can see that the New IS-LM\nmodel suggests that there are important limits on interest rate rules if there\nis to be a unique equilibrium. There are important differences in the zones\nof indeterminacy for rules that respond to current in ﬂation and prospective\ninﬂation.\nAn Alternative Nominal Anchor\nWhile there is a substantial limit on the coefﬁcients in “inﬂation” rules such as\nthose put forward by Taylor (1993), it is important to note that interest rate rules\nwith an alternative nominal anchor — a relationship to the price level — also\n49 Michael Dotsey has stressed to me that there are no unique equilibria with forward-looking\nrules in a ﬂexible price model, since the Fisher equation and policy rule are each equations\nlinking the nominal rate to expected in ﬂation. The restriction on in ﬂation, analogous to (23),\nis τ1[Etπt+1 − π] + xRt = [Etπt+1 − π] and there is no possibility of a unique equilibrium.\nHence, as described in the text discussion of the current in ﬂation rule, an increase in ϕs leads to a\nshrinking zone of admissable rules. But in this case the range of admissable rules is asymptotically\nnegligible.\n50 The appendix analysis also indicates that the lower boundary is given by τ0 = τ1 −\n2(1+β)\nϕs − 1. Hence, a positive value of τ1 requires that even more negative values of τ0 are\nnecessary to assure uniqueness relative to those shown in panel a.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 81\ncan be used to insure neutral output under an interest rate rule. In particular,\nsuppose that the nominal interest rate rule takes the form\nRt = rt + Etπt+1 + f(Pt − ˜Pt) + xRt, (26)\nwhich involves three components. First, as above, the nominal interest rate\nmoves with the underlying neutral interest rate Rt = rt + Etπt+1 as above.\nSecond, there are interest rate shocks xRt as above. Third, the nominal rate\nis adjusted whenever the price level deviates from a target path ˜Pt. Then, it\nis possible to show that there is a unique stable rational expectations equi-\nlibrium so long as f> 0, i.e., the nominal rate is raised whenever the price\nlevel exceeds the target path.\n51 This theoretical conclusion corresponds to an\nidea sometimes presented in discussions of monetary policy — for example,\nGoodfriend and King (1997)— that a central bank can have a greater degree of\nfreedom in the short-run dimensions of its policy rule if it adopts a speciﬁcation\nwhich recognizes the importance of the price level.\n8. POLICY: SHOCKS, RULES, AND TRADE-OFFS\nThe New IS-LM model suggests that monetary policy may inﬂuence real eco-\nnomic activity in two distinct ways. First, the central bank may itself be a\nsource of shocks, with the effects of monetary policy disturbances also de-\npending on the form of the monetary policy rule in place. Second, by the\nchoice of its monetary policy rule, the central bank can affect how macroe-\nconomic activity responds to shocks originating elsewhere in the economy.\nThe various inﬂuences of monetary policy may be summarized by a graph, as\nemployed by Taylor (1979) and many subsequent studies, of the relationship\nbetween the variability of in ﬂation and the variability of real activity. This\nsection considers each of these ideas in turn.\nDynamic Response to an Interest Rate Shock\nIncreases in the target range for a short-term interest rate, such as the federal\nfunds rate in the United States, are a monetary policy shock of sorts. These\nchanges are typically suggested to lower the rate of inﬂation and to temporarily\ndecrease real output as well.\nIn order to study the effects of such a shock within the New IS-LM model, it\nis necessary to choose parameters of the model— including those of the private\neconomy (β,s,ϕ ) and of the policy rule ( τ\n0,τ 1 and the process governing\n51 The derivation in Appendix C assumes that the target path is the neutral price level path\nPt for ease of mathematical analysis. However, nearly any target path can be accommodated since\nthe rule can be rewritten as Rt = Rt + f(Pt − ˜Pt)+ xRt = Rt + f(Pt − Pt)+{ xRt + f(Pt − ˜Pt)}\nwith the deviation f(Pt − ˜Pt) being an additional shock of sorts.\n82 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nxRt)— and solve for the dynamic responses to the shock. As an example,\nFigure 4 displays the paths that arise when there is a simple rule that mandates\na response to current, but not expected, inﬂation. The speciﬁc rule is\nR\nt = r + π + τ(π t − π) + xRt\nwith τ set equal to 1 .05 so as to assure uniqueness. It is also assumed that\nthere is an interest rate shock process that is ﬁrst order autoregressive, xt =\nρRxt−1 +et, and that ρR = .75. The policy shock is a rise in the nominal rate,\ne0 = 1 with et = 0 for t> 0.52\nAs discussed above, the time unit is taken to be one quarter of a year,\nwhich is a conventional macroeconomic modeling interval. The shock shown\nin the ﬁgure is a 100-basis-point rise in the annualized interest rate (e\n0 = 1) as\nshown in panel a of theﬁgure. Readers may ﬁnd these graphs are most easily\ninterpreted as representing the deviation from an initial zero in ﬂation steady\nstate in which the economy is operating at capacity output, although since\nthe model is linear they also describe the effects of shocks on the economy\nmore generally. This increase in interest rate is assumed to be followed by\na 50-basis-point increase in the subsequent year, a 25-basis-point increase in\nthe year after that, and so forth.\nResponse of output: The interest rate shock causes an immediate decline\nin output, with output reduced about 1/2 percent below capacity in the initial\nperiod (date 0) in panel b of Figure 4. The vertical axis can be interpreted as\nmeasuring the percentage deviation from the capacity level of output, so that\nit is about .45 in period 0, about .34 in period one, and so forth.\n53\nResponse of inﬂation: The period of reduced output shown in panel b is\naccompanied by a similar interval of reduced inﬂation in panel c. As in Figure\n2, the inﬂation rate is stated at an annualized perentage rate, so that it is four\ntimes the percentage change in the price level betweent − 1 and t. There is a\nrelatively small reduction in inﬂation in the near term.54\nResponse of the nominal interest rate: The behavior of in ﬂation also is\nimportant for the path of the nominal interest rate in Figure 4; there is an\nimportant difference between the policy shock component of the interest rate\n(the ‘o’path in panel a) and the actual behavior of the nominal interest rates.\nWhile there is a 100-basis-point increase in the policy shock component of the\ninterest rate (x\nR0), the decline in inﬂation means that this is not fully reﬂected\n52 In terms of the private sector parameters, β = .99, s = .5, and ϕ = .05. The value of\ns is in line with estimates of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, which typically exceed\nunity. The value of β is a conventional quarterly discount rate. The value of ϕ = .05 is one of\nthose employed by Taylor (1980).\n53 Since output is depressed below capacity in period 0, it is expected to grow back toward\nits capacity level, with the one period growth rate being about .11 = (−.34) − (−.45).A t a n\nannualized rate of growth, this is .45 percent.\n54 There is a decrease in the annualized in ﬂation rate of .35 percent in the initial period and\na decrease of about .27 percent in the subsequent period.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 83\nFigure 4\nin the nominal rate. 55 The New IS-LM model therefore suggests that there\nmay be a quantitatively large difference between monetary policy shocks and\nthe innovations in the path of the interest rate.\nResponse of the real rate: There are two complementary ways of looking\nat the path for the real interest rate. One highlights the fact that the real interest\nrate rises by more than the nominal interest rate since there is a temporary\nperiod of expected de ﬂation.\n56 The other derives from the link between the\n55 The response of the nominal interest rate is given by R0 = τ0π0 + xR0\n= 1.05 ∗ (−0.35) + 1 = .63.\n56 In fact, at date 0, the nominal interest rate rises by 63 basis points and the real interest\nrate rises by 90 basis points (since in ﬂation is expected to be −.27 percent next period).\n84 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nFigure 4\nreal interest rate and the growth rate of output, based on the speci ﬁcation of\nrt = 1\ns [Etyt+1 −yt +xdt ].57 Each of these complementary descriptions of the\nreal interest rate is a partial explanation of the workings of this simple dynamic\ngeneral equilibrium model, but each also helps understand its operation.\n57 Recall from a previous footnote that s = .5. The real interest rate at date 0 is .90 percent\nhigher because the economy is expected to grow about .45 percent between period 1 and period\n0, so that the response of the real interest rate is .90% = 1\ns [Etyt+1 − yt] = 2 ∗ .45%.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 85\nPolicy Rules and Macroeconomic Activity\nTo illustrate that alternative monetary policy rules can have a potentially im-\nportant effect on how the macroeconomy responds to various shocks, it is\neasiest to modify the example studied in Section 4.2 above, which was used\nto trace out the dynamic response of prices and output to a change in nomi-\nnal income. This is an interesting example from the standpoint of the design\nof monetary policy rules because some economists have suggested that the\ncentral bank should conduct monetary policy so that there is a target path of\nnominal output (see McCallum and Nelson [1999a] for one recent discussion\nof such nominal GDP rules).\nOne case for nominal GDP rules: It is sometimes argued that nominal\nGDP rules are desirable because they insulate output from various shocks.\nIn the New IS-LM model, if monetary policy is structured so that nominal\nincome is exogenous, then the analysis of Section 4 can be used to discuss the\ndetermination of output in the absence of price shocks or changes in capacity.\nIn this case, with constant nominal income, the level of output would remain\nat capacity even if there were changes in the position of the IS curve, the LM\ncurve, and so forth.\nThe case against nominal GDP rules if capacity changes:There is an im-\nportant cost of such rules, which is that when there is an expansion of capacity\noutput, the economy cannot immediately expand up to the new capacity level\nsince the price level must gradually fall through time.\n58 By contrast, under\nthe neutral monetary policy discussed earlier, a monetary expansion would\nhave permitted an immediate output expansion while leaving the price level\nunaffected by the expansion of capacity.\nThe case against nominal GDP rules if there are price shocks: There\nis a similar case against nominal GDP rules if there are price shocks. In\nSection 3, it was shown that a neutral monetary policy would accommodate\nthose disturbances, so that nominal income would change according toxleltanY\nt =\nxleltanπt + xleltanyt under a neutral policy. Price shocks would therefore also cause\ndepartures from capacity output if a nominal GDP rule were in place. For\nexample, a positive price shock would raise the price level and lower output\nrelative to capacity.\nThe relevance of alternative monetary rules for macroeconomic activity\nwas originally stressed by Phelps and Taylor (1977), working in a loglinear\nmacromodel with nominal stickiness. Dotsey (1999) has recently highlighted\n58 Calculations similar to those in Section 4 can illustrate this point. Suppose that the path\nof nominal output ( Yt = yt + Pt) is constant through time at Y and that capacity output is a\nrandom walk, yt = yt−1 + et with et being white noise. The solution for the price level is\nPt = θPt−1 + (1 − θ)(Y − yt). Output is then yt − yt = θ(yt−1 − yt−1) − (1 − θ)(yt − yt−1).\nMechanically, this solution says that an increase in capacity output of xleltanyt only affects current\noutput by θxleltanyt: as discussed above, the stickiness of prices — as captured by θ— implies that the\neconomy cannot immediately expand up to the new level of capacity output.\n86 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nFigure 5\nthis relevance, working in fully articulated models with a slightly different\nspeciﬁcation of price stickiness from that considered here. The fact that the\nform of the monetary policy rule matters for the response of the economy to real\nand nominal shocks is motivating many economists to study the performance\nof alternative monetary policy rules in forward-looking macromodels.\nThe Variability Trade-off\nTaylor (1979) introduced the idea of summarizing the effects of alternative\nmonetary policy rules in terms of their implications for the variability of inﬂa-\ntion and real activity. He also suggested that there would typically be trade-offs\nbetween these two variability measures. Within the New IS-LM framework\nas developed here, both the internal logic of the model and a close reading of\nTaylor indicates that the natural trade-off to explore is that between inﬂation\nπ\nt and the output deviation zt = yt − yt.\nAs an example, suppose that there are only in ﬂation shocks xπt and that\nthese are serially uncorrelated random variables. Suppose additionally that\nthe monetary authority can respond directly to inﬂation shocks and does so to\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 87\nmake inﬂation equal to πt = fxπt , where f is a parameter that governs the\nextent of the inﬂation response. Making use of the Phillips curve (3) and the\nfact that expected future inﬂation is zero, it follows that\nvar(π t) = f2var(xπt )\nvar(zt) = (f − 1\nϕ )2var(xπt ),\nwhere var(π t) is the variance of in ﬂation, var(zt) is the variance of the\ndeviation of output from capacity and var(xπt ) is the variance of xπt .\nTo look at policies that minimize output variance given inﬂation variance,\nit is sufﬁcient to restrict attention to values of f between zero and one. Over\nthe range between zero and one, there is indeed a trade-off. If there is a larger\nvalue of f, then there is more in ﬂation variability but less output variability.\nThis trade-off is illustrated with the downward sloping solid line in Figure\n5. The neutral monetary policy discussed in Section 3 above corresponds to\nminimizing the variance of output deviations by setting f equal to 1.\nIf in ﬂation responds to another shock that is serially uncorrelated and\nuncorrelated with the inﬂation shock— for example, to productivity or money\ndemand disturbances— according to a rule π\nt = fxπt +get, then the frontier\nwould shift upward, as illustrated by the dashed line in Figure 5. Proceeding\nas above, this alternative frontier is\nvar(π\nt) = f2var(xπt ) + g2var(et)\nvar(zt) = (f − 1\nϕ )2var(xπt ) + (g\nϕ)2var(et)\nso that monetary policies allowing these in ﬂuences would produce more in-\nﬂation variability for a given amount of output variability.\n9. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nThe distinguishing characteristic of the New IS-LM model is that its key behav-\nioral relations can be derived from underlying choice problems of households\nand ﬁrms and that these relations consequently involve expectations about the\nfuture in a central manner. The IS curve relates expected output growth to\nthe real interest rate, which is a central implication of the modern theory of\nconsumption. The aggregate supply/Phillips curve component of the model\nrelates inﬂation today to expected future inﬂation and an output gap. This rela-\ntionship can be derived from a monopoly pricing decision that is constrained\nby stochastic opportunities for price adjustment together with a consistent\ndeﬁnition of the price level.\nThe New IS-LM model is increasingly being utilized to illustrate macroe-\nconomic concepts that are robust across a variety of more detailed models and\nto exposit the implications of alternative monetary policy rules. This article\nhas provided a description of this framework, highlighting its language and\n88 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nlogic. The article has also derived certain key implications of the framework\nfor the conduct of monetary policy, which are summarized in the introduction:\nthe case for inﬂation targets, the importance of adjustment of real and nominal\ninterest rates to underlying real disturbances, the relevance of alternative mon-\netary rules for the determination of output, and the potential consequences of\nmonetary policy shocks.\nThree aspects of this article may strike some readers as curious choices\nsince my recent research has been aimed at developing small-scale fully artic-\nulated models of nominal frictions\n59 and exploring the implications of optimal\nand alternative policy rules within these models.60 First, the New IS-LM model\nis laid out with many free parameters and no attempt is made to compare its key\npredictions to the experience of the United States or other countries. Second,\nthe New IS-LM model can be derived from ﬁrst principles as a fully articu-\nlated model that arises from specifying preferences, technologies, and market\ninstitutions; poses and solves household andﬁrm optimization problems; and\nﬁnally imposes market equilibrium and other aggregate consistency condi-\ntions. This article, however, does not derive the behavioral relations fromﬁrst\nprinciples. Instead, it follows the traditional IS-LM approach of postulating\nbehavioral relations, with some background rationalization in terms of opti-\nmizing, and then manipulates these to study various monetary policy issues.\nThird, the New IS-LM model abstracts from investment and capital, while\nmost of my research has placed these features at center stage.\nAt one level, this approach re ﬂects the limited goal of the article — to\nprovide a simple exposition of the New IS-LM model and to exemplify how\nit is currently being used to discuss monetary policy topics. This goal was\nitself chosen, however, because it is my belief that many macroeconomists\nwill use the New IS-LM model without all of its background detail to discuss\nmonetary policy and, in particular, to communicate results from other, more\ncomplicated macroeconomic models.\nYet the microeconomic foundations are not to be dismissed. In the course\nof this article, there were many critical junctures at which the New IS-LM\nmodel was silent on central questions because microfoundations were absent.\nFor example, in the Section 3 discussion of why a neutral monetary policy—\ndeﬁned as one that stabilized output at a capacity level — was desirable, it\nwas necessary to step outside the New IS-LM model to draw on alternative\nstudies in which the concept of capacity output was carefully de ﬁned and in\nwhich the monetary policy conclusion was derived as one that maximized the\nwelfare of the citizens of the economy. Otherwise, the neutral monetary policy,\nwhich is marked as the point ‘o’in Figure 5, would simply be one of a menu\nof choices that the monetary authority might consider desirable, given some\n59 King and Watson (1996), King and Wolman (1996), and Dotsey, King, and Wolman (1999).\n60 King and Wolman (1996), Goodfriend and King (1997), and King and Wolman (1999).\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 89\nposited preferences of its own. Further, the analysis of neutral and alternative\nmonetary policies suggests that the case for in ﬂation targets, as opposed to\na policy of full price level stabilization, depends entirely on the existence of\ninﬂation shocks. If these shocks were absent, the Taylor frontier in Figure\n5 would collapse to the origin, with no trade-off between the variability of\ninﬂation and the variability of output relative to capacity (this possibility is\nmarked as * in theﬁgure). Yet there is an increasing use of the New Keynesian\nPhillips curve and the New IS-LM model for monetary policy analysis without\ndetailed consideration of a question which seems central: What are in ﬂation\nshocks?\n61 Popular discussions sometimes point to changes in capacity output\n(supply shocks) or energy price variations as price shocks. Nevertheless, to\nstudy whether these are price shocks of the form incorporated in this model,\nit is necessary to develop additional microeconomic underpinnings of the\nNew IS-LM model, working in detail with the pricing decisions of ﬁrms,\nthe consumption decisions of households, and so forth. Changes in capacity\noutput induced by ﬂuctuations in productivity or the prices of inputs such as\nenergy are not price shocks according to such a detailed analysis because these\naffect prices by shifting marginal cost, which is a key economic determinant\nincluded in the pricing equation. Within the basic framework of sticky price\nmodels, it is difﬁcult toﬁnd price shocks that are not interpretable as behavioral\nerrors on the part of price-setters, although perhaps the addition of a sector\nwith ﬂexible price ﬁrms would lead to changes in relative prices that might be\ninterpreted in this manner.\n62 This issue illustrates well, I believe, an inevitable\nlimitation of IS-LM style analysis, which is that it may be useful for illustrating\nnew results but it will certainly not be useful for deriving them. Finally, my\nsuspicion is that the omission of investment and capital from the New IS-LM\nmodel may be an important, if not fatal, ﬂaw. But determining whether this\nsuspicion is warranted will again require a more detailed analysis that builds\nup from the microfoundations.\nUltimately, the case for (or against) the New IS-LM model and its fully\narticulated relatives must involve a systematic exploration of their empirical\nimplications. There is much recent progress on this important front that in-\nvolves the evaluation of components of the models— notably the pricing and\naggregate demand speciﬁcations— and full system implications. But a great\ndeal of work remains to be done before we understand whether this new small\nmodel captures the reality of the choices facing monetary policy decisionmak-\ners of major economies.\n61 See, for example, Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999).\n62 I have bene ﬁted from discussion of this topic with John Taylor.\n90 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nAPPENDIX A: DERIVING THE NEW PHILLIPS\nCURVE\nStart with the equations describing the price level (11) and the optimal price\n(12), which are repeated from the main text as\nA − 1: Pt = ηPt−1 + (1 − η)P∗\nt\nA − 2: P∗\nt = ηβEtP∗\nt+1 + (1 − βη)[ψt + Pt] + zpt,\nwhere zpt = xPt − βηEtxP,t+1.

The product of\nthe roots of this polynomial is 1\nβ and the sum of roots is (1 + 1\nβ + ϕ\nβ ).I f θ is\nthe smaller of the roots, then the larger of the roots is 1\nβθ > 1.\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 91\nFigure B-1\nA graphical analysis of the roots of this familiar difference equation will\nprovide some useful background for the analysis of more complicated models\nbelow. The graph is based on decomposingxPhin(z)= 0 into xPhin(z)= q(z)−l(z)\nwith l(z) =− ϕz and q(z) = [−βz\n2 + (1 + β)z − 1] =− (1 − z)(1 − βz).\nFigure B-1 displays the quadratic equationq(z), which has roots of 1 and 1/β,\nand the line l(z), which is negatively sloped if ϕ> 0 and passes through the\norigin. The intersection of these two curves implies that l(z) = q(z) and thus\nthe values of z at the intersection points are the solutions to xPhin(z)= 0.\nWith ϕ = 0, l(z) = 0 and the solutions are thus 1 and 1/β. For any ϕ> 0\nthe solution must be as displayed in Figure B-1, which is that there is one root\nless than 1 and one root that is greater than 1 /β. Finally, increases in ϕ will\nlower the smaller root θ.\nWith this information about the magnitude of the roots, the next task is to\ndetermine the solution, following Sargent (1978). Using the operatorF which\nshifts the dating of the variable, but not the conditional expectation so that\nF\njEtxt+k = Etxt+k+j, we can deduce that\n92 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nϕ\nβEt(Yt − yt) =− EtPt+1 + (1 + 1\nβ + ϕ\nβ)Pt − 1\nβPt−1\n=− (F − θ)(F − 1\nθβ )EtPt−1\n= ( 1\nθβ )(F − θ)(1 − θβF)EtPt−1.\nThe general solution to the difference equation can be produced by unwinding\nthe unstable root forward, so that\nPt − θPt−1 = θϕ 1\n(1 − θβF)Et(Yt − yt)\n= (1 − θ)(1 − βθ)\n∞∑\nj=0\n(θβ)jEt(Yt+j − yt+j)\nwith one step in this derivation using the fact that(1+ 1\nβ + ϕ\nβ ) = θ + 1\nβθ means\nthat θϕ = (1 − θ)(1 − βθ).\nUnder the assumed driving process, it follows that\n∞∑\nj=0\n(θβ)jEt(Yt+j)\n=\n∞∑\nj=0\n(θβ)jEt[Yt−1 + (Yt − Yt−1) + ...(Y t+j − Yt)]\n=\n∞∑\nj=0\n(θβ)j[Yt−1 + (1 + ρ + ρ2 ... + ρj)(Yt − Yt−1)]\n= 1\n1 − θβ Yt−1 + [( 1\n1 − θβ )( 1\n1 − θβρ )(Yt − Yt−1)]\nso that the speciﬁc solution for the price level is\nPt = θPt−1 + (1 − θ)(Yt−1 − y) + [ 1 − θ\n1 − θβρ ](Yt − Yt−1).\nTo ﬁnd the behavior of output, we use the relationship between nominal and\nreal income followed by some algebra:\nR.

For\nexample, the IS equation isy\nt = Etyt+1 −srt +xdt and its neutral counterpart\nis yt = Etyt+1 − srt + xdt so that the result is\nIS : yt − yt = Et(yt+1 − yt+1) − s(rt − rt).\nSimilarly, the Fisher equation is\nF : rt − rt = (Rt − Rt) − Et(πt+1 − πt+1)\nand the Phillips curve is\nPC : (πt − πt) = βEt(πt+1 − πt+1) + ϕ(yt − yt).\nThe monetary policy rules can similarly be transformed, by simply subtracting\nRt = rt + Etπt+1 from both sides of the equation.\nFor example, with the general speciﬁcation (text ref) we have that\nRt − Rt = τ1(Etπt+1 − Etπt+1) + τ0(πt − πt) + xRt.\nThus, the analysis of system dynamics can be performed as if all shocks had\nbeen dropped— except for the policy shock— and the capacity output level had\nbeen treated as constant.\nSimilarly, with the price level speciﬁcation (text ref) we have that\nRt − Rt = f(Pt − Pt) +{ f(Pt − ˜Pt) + xRt}\nso that the term in braces can be treated as a complicated interest rate shock.\nHence, in the remainder of this appendix, attention is restricted to analysis\nof a deterministic system— without any shocks or time variation in capacity—\nfor the purpose of studying uniqueness issues.\n94 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nThe text discussion of interest rate rules involved the idea that there was a\nunique equilibrium so long as the central bank was willing to raise the real rate\nin speciﬁed circumstances, which suggests focusing on the real interest rate.\nTo derive one restriction on the real rate, multiply IS byϕ and then eliminate\noutput using the Phillips curve:\nϕs ∗ r\nt = [−πt + (1 + β)Etπt+1 − βEtπt+2] =− [(1 − F)(1 − βF)]Etπt,\nwhere F is the forward operator as in the main text. This is a private sector\nrestriction on the behavior of the real interest rate, which links it to the inﬂation\nrate.\nUniqueness with the Interest Rate Rule (21)\nCombining the Fisher equation (2) and the monetary policy rule (21), it is\npossible to determine an additional restriction on the real interest rate:\nr\nt = τ0πt + (τ1 − 1)Etπt+1 = [τ0 + (τ1 − 1)F]Etπt.\nCombining this expression with the private sector restriction on the real\nrate leads to\nl(F)Etπt = ϕs[τ0 + (τ1 − 1)F]Etπt\n=− [(1 − F)(1 − βF)]Etπt = q(F)Etπt.\nThe left-hand side of this expression is a linear function l, and the right hand\nside of this expression is a quadratic function q.\nThe nature of the system dynamics will depend on the roots of the quadratic\npolynomial q(z) − l(z), which may be written as\n−βz2 + [β + 1 − ϕs(τ 1 − 1)]z − [1 + ϕsτ 0] =− β(z − µ1)(z − µ2).\nThis expression makes clear that the sum of the roots is [1 + 1\nβ + ϕs(τ 1−1)\nβ ]\nand that the product of the roots is [1+ϕsτ 0\nβ ]. Since there are no predetermined\nvariables in this system, there is a unique equilibrium only if there are two\nunstable roots, i.e., values of µ\ni that are both larger than unity in absolute\nvalue. To study the magnitude of these, it is convenient to use a mixture of\ngraphical and analytical techniques.\nDetermining the boundaries: The boundaries of the policy parameter\nregions can be determined by requiring that there is a root of exactly positive\nor negative one. Taking the positive unit root ﬁrst,\nl(1) = q(1)\n⇒ ϕs[τ\n0 + (τ1 − 1)1] =− [(1 − 1)(1 − β1)] = 0 ⇒ τ0 + τ1 = 1\nR. G. King: New IS-LM Model 95\nso that there is a restriction that the sum of the policy rule coef ﬁcients must\nequal one from this source. Taking the negative unit root next,\nl(−1) = q(−1) ⇒ ϕs[τ0 + (τ1 − 1)(−1)] =\n− [(1 − (−1))(1 − β(−1))] =− 2(1 + β) ⇒ τ0 − τ1 =− 1 − 2(1 + β)\nϕs\nso that there is a restriction on the difference between the coef ﬁcients from\nthis source.\nGraphing the functions l(z) and q(z) to determine the nature of the regions:\nA graph of the functions, similar to that used in Appendix B above, provides\nthe easiest way of determining the nature of the roots in the regions deﬁned by\nthe above boundaries. Figure C-1 shows the nature of this pair of functions.\nThe form of the quadratic equationq(z) is invariant to the nature of the policy\nrule; as is clear from the fact that q(z) =− [(1 − z)(1 − βz)] = 0 the two\nzeros are 1 and 1/β. The ﬁgure is drawn for the case of a simple rule which\ninvolves only response to current, not expected in ﬂation (τ1 = 0) so that it\ncorresponds to panel a of Figure 3 in the text. The function l(z) is downward\nsloping in this case since l(z) = sϕ(τ 0 − z) and sϕ > 0. If τ0 = 1 then l(z)\nintersects with the quadratic at z = 1; this possibility is shown by the dashed\nline in B-1. If τ0 > 1, then this intersection is shifted to the right, i.e., all roots\nare greater than 1. In this case, there are two unstable roots and there is thus\na unique stable rational expectations equilibrium. Hence, as τ\n0 is increased\nfrom the boundary region in panel a of Figure 3 in the main text, the region of\nunique equilibria is entered.\nThis graphical analysis can also be used to (i) conﬁrm that a reduction in\nτ\n0 from the other boundary also produces an entry into the region of stability\nin panel a of Figure 3 of the text, and (ii) to determine that the other aspects\nof panels b and c are as described in the text.\nUniqueness with the Interest Rate Rule (26)\nBy combining the Fisher equation (2) and the monetary policy rule (26), it is\npossible to determine an additional restriction on the real interest rate:\nr\nt = fPt − Etπt+1 = [F − F(F − 1)]EtPt−1.\nCombining this expression with the private sector restriction on the real\nrate leads to\na(F)EtPt−1 = ϕs[fF − F(F − 1)]EtPt−1\n=− [(1 − F)(1 − βF)][F − 1]EtPt−t = b(F)EtPt−1.\nThe left-hand side of this expression is a quadratic function, a(F), and the\nright-hand side of this expression is a cubic function b(F).\n96 Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Quarterly\nThe nature of the system dynamics will depend on the roots of the poly-\nnomial c(z) = b(z) − a(z). To study the magnitude of these, it is again\nconvenient to use a mixture of graphical and analytical techniques.\nDetermining the roots of a(z) and b(z): It turns out to be a simple matter\nto determine the roots of these expressions. The quadratic function q(z) has\ntwo roots, one of which is zero and the other of which is f + 1. The cubic\nequation b(z) has a root of\n1\nβ and two roots of 1.\nGraphing the functions a(z) and b(z) to determine the stability condition:\nA graph of the functions provides the easiest way of determining the nature\nof the roots of the cubic polynomial c(z) = b(z) − a(z) = 0.\nFigure C-2 contains three functions. One of the solid lines is the cubic\nb(z), which highlights the fact that it has two repeated roots at z = 1 and a\nsingle root at z = 1/β.\nThe dashed line is the quadratic a(z) with the parameter f = 0. There\nare two roots of this equation, one which is zero and the other which is unity.\nHence, with f = 0, the graph highlights the fact — which can easily be de-\ntermined using the deﬁnitions of a(z) and b(z)— that there is an exact root of\nunity in c(z). It also shows only one other intersection of the two lines, so that\nthere is one unstable root and two unit roots of c(z) = b(z) − a(z).\nThe solid line which lies below the dashed line in the range 0 <z< 1i s\nan example of the quadratic a(z) with the parameter f> 0. Note that there\nis a zero root to this quadratic and a root greater than one (which was earlier\ndetermined to be 1 + f). Hence, with f> 0 there are three distinct roots,\none which is positive and less than unity and the other two which are unstable.\nThis is the con ﬁguration that insures uniqueness given that there is a single\npredetermined variable P\nt−1.\nR.
