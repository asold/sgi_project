INTRODUCTION \nThe doubly fed induction machine is a useful motor for industrial application and a largely adopted \ngenerator in wind energy farms. Its speed and torque can be controlled by rheostats or frequency \nconverter connected to the rotor winding, what allows the reduction of convert er power just to a \nfraction of induction machine mechanical power, saving installation costs [1] – [7]. \nIn this context, the benefits of the use of doubly fed induction machines are undeniable; \nnevertheless, to take advantages of them it is mandatory to pr ovide electrical connection between the \nrotor winding and the rheostat or the frequency converter [1] – [8].  \nThe most common way to access the rotor winding is by brushes and slip -rings. However, the \nmechanical contact between moving slip -rings and static  brushes wears these components and \ninvolves high rate of maintenance. Powder generated by brushes wearing can be also prejudicial for \nmotor insulation. Additionally, any fault on electrical contact can generate sparks, limiting this \nmachine installation only to non-explosive environments [1] – [3]. \nThe development of brushless technologies is very interesting for reducing maintenance costs and \nexpanding the use of doubly fed induction machines to explosive atmospheres [1] – [8].  \nMany studies consider the use of two induction machines connected in cascade for obtaining \nWound Rotor Doubly Fed Induction Machine \nwith Radial Rotary Transformer \nMaurício Ruviaro, Fredemar Rüncos  \nWEG Equipamentos Elétricos S.A. – Energia, Jaraguá do Sul – SC, Brazil \n mauricior@weg.net, fredemar@weg.net  \n \nNelson Sadowski \nDepartment of Electrical Engineering, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis – SC, Brazil \nnelson@grucad.ufsc.br  \nJournal of Microwaves, Optoelectronics and Electromagnetic Applications, Vol. 12, No. 2, December 2013 \nBrazilian Microwave and Optoelectronics Society-SBMO received 21 Oct 2012; for review 7 Dec 2012; accepted 3 July 2013 \nBrazilian Society of Electromagnetism-SBMag © 2013 SBMO/SBMag ISSN 2179-1074 \n \n 412 \nbrushless devices [4] – [8]. This solution is  effective from the point of view of eliminating brushes \nand slip-rings, but introduces the superposition of two different torque curve behaviors. The result is a \ndevice with anomalous torque vs. speed curve in which synchronous speed is determined by the \ncombination of the number of poles of each machine [4], [5]. Only the join of the induction machine \nwith a device incapable to offer any resistanc e torque avoids  any change on the typical shape of \ntorque vs. speed curve [1]. \nSince the seventies, there are several studies with the aim of substituting brushes and slip -rings by \ncontactless energy transfer systems, like, e.g., rotary transformers [9] – [18]. Initially, these devices \nwere developed concerning spacecrafts applications, where the lack of reliability and high rate of \nmaintenance of brushes and slip -rings are totally undesirable [9]. In [11], Papastergiou and \nMacpherson propose the rotary transformer as an alternative solution for contactless transfer of energy \nacross the revolving frame of airborne electronic-scanning radar. In [17], Legranger et al. propose the \nreplacement of gliding contacts of a wound rotor synchronous machine by a radial rotary transformer \noperating like a contactless transmission power system. Despite of some particularities, the majority \nof studies for rotary transformer involve applications where the transformer is submitted to \nfrequencies of hundreds of Hz [9] – [18]. \nIn [1] – [3]  Ruviaro et al. present the use of a radial three-phase rotary transformer electrically \nconnected to an induction machine rotor circuit as can be seen at Figure 1.  \n \n \nFigure 1 – Doubly fed three-phase induction machine with rotary transformer \n \nThe rotary transformer allows the access to rotor circuit without any mechanical contact. By using \nan appropriate drive, it is possible to control the induction machine operation as motor or generator at \nalmost any speed, except at synchronous rotation. \nThe solution presented in [1] – [3] is very convenient for systems that must generate voltages with \nconstant frequency through variable speed devices, like wind turbines [4] - [8]. \nII.

This configuration allows controlling torque, speed, power factor and current of \ninduction machine by a converter connected to the stator winding of the rotary transformer.

In Fig. 1 2, the difference between measured and simulated current curves is \nconsequence of some saturation on rotary transformer due to external resistance increasing. This \neffect is originated by adoption of lin ear values for rotary transformer parameters on steady state \nmodel. \nTables VI and VII present measurement results for 25% to 125% load for motor and generator \nregime.

Obviously, this reduction on power factor is explained by the inductive nature of \nrotary transformer [1]. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nRotary transformers are an interesting alternative to substitute brushes and slip -rings on wound \nrotor induct ion machines. Avoiding mechanical contact between rotating circuits, motors and \ngenerators maintenance can be drastically reduced. \nThe development of analytical equations for rotary transformer calculation is a good way for \nobtaining fast results, consisti ng in important resource for the development of industrial software for \ndesigning this device. \nThe realization of laboratory tests under the equipment shows concordance between steady -state \nsimulation and measurement results. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nAuthors wish to thank WEG Equipamentos Elétricos S.A. for the prototype building and the use of \nits tests facilities. \nREFERENCES \n[1] M.
