    "abstract": "The rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models demands a\\nthorough investigation of biases and risks inherent in these models to\\nunderstand their impact on individuals and society. This study extends the\\nfocus of bias evaluation in extant work by examining bias against social\\nstigmas on a large scale. It focuses on 93 stigmatized groups in the United\\nStates, including a wide range of conditions related to disease, disability,\\ndrug use, mental illness, religion, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and other\\nrelevant factors. We investigate bias against these groups in English\\npre-trained Masked Language Models (MLMs) and their downstream sentiment\\nclassification tasks. To evaluate the presence of bias against 93 stigmatized\\nconditions, we identify 29 non-stigmatized conditions to conduct a comparative\\nanalysis. Building upon a psychology scale of social rejection, the Social\\nDistance Scale, we prompt six MLMs: RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-large, XLNet-large,\\nBERTweet-base, BERTweet-large, and DistilBERT. We use human annotations to\\nanalyze the predicted words from these models, with which we measure the extent\\nof bias against stigmatized groups. When prompts include stigmatized\\nconditions, the probability of MLMs predicting negative words is approximately\\n20 percent higher than when prompts have non-stigmatized conditions. In the\\nsentiment classification tasks, when sentences include stigmatized conditions\\nrelated to diseases, disability, education, and mental illness, they are more\\nlikely to be classified as negative. We also observe a strong correlation\\nbetween bias in MLMs and their downstream sentiment classifiers (r =0.79). The\\nevidence indicates that MLMs and their downstream sentiment classification\\ntasks exhibit biases against socially stigmatized groups.\\n",
