    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Interest is growing in the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots and large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, particularly in dental education. To explore dental educators‘ perceptions of AI chatbots and large language models, specifically their potential benefits and challenges for dental education. Materials and Methods A global cross‐sectional survey was conducted in May–June 2023 using a 31‐item online‐questionnaire to assess dental educators' perceptions of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and their influence on dental education. Dental educators, representing diverse backgrounds, were asked about their use of AI, its perceived impact, barriers to using chatbots, and the future role of AI in this field. Results 428 dental educators (survey views = 1516; response rate = 28%) with a median [25/75th percentiles] age of 45 [37, 56] and 16 [8, 25] years of experience participated, with the majority from the Americas (54%), followed by Europe (26%) and Asia (10%). Thirty‐one percent of respondents already use AI tools, with 64% recognising their potential in dental education. Perception of AI's potential impact on dental education varied by region, with Africa (4[4–5]), Asia (4[4–5]), and the Americas (4[3–5]) perceiving more potential than Europe (3[3–4]). Educators stated that AI chatbots could enhance knowledge acquisition (74.3%), research (68.5%), and clinical decision‐making (63.6%) but expressed concern about AI's potential to reduce human interaction (53.9%). Dental educators' chief concerns centred around the absence of clear guidelines and training for using AI chatbots. Conclusion A positive yet cautious view towards AI chatbot integration in dental curricula is prevalent, underscoring the need for clear implementation guidelines.",
