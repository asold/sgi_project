INTRODUCTION\nInstrument transformers are important assets, used through-\nout the transmission and distribution networks for monitoring\nvoltages and currents [1]. Dry-type instrument transformers\nmade of cast resin are highly suitable over oil isolated trans-\nformers in many operations due to several advantages such\nas mechanical and dielectric properties, heat resistance, non-\nﬂammability, etc. [2], [3]. They are also extensively used in\ncommercial and industrial settings [4]. However, the low ther-\nmal conductivity in dry-type instrument transformers results\nin high operating temperatures, directly inﬂuencing their per-\nformance and service life [2], [5].\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Ramakrishnan Srinivasan\n.\nFigure 1 illustrates the construction of a cast resin dry-type\nmedium voltage instrument transformer manufactured for\nindoor service. The windings are manufactured with double\nenamel copper wires; the core is built of silicon steel and the\nlamination is of grain-oriented type with high permeability\nand low losses; the core and windings are encapsulated in\nepoxy resin that provides excellent dielectric properties and\nmechanical resistance [6].\nManufacturers usually design dry-type instrument trans-\nformers to operate at ambient temperature with permanent\nloading capacity [4]. However, external temperature instabil-\nity, electrical characteristics, resin property and degradation\nof the transformer internal insulation can lead to undesirable\nthermal performance [3].\nOver the years, several research works have been pre-\nviously carried out to study the temperature distribution\n164392 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Juarez-Balderaset al.: Hot-Spot Temperature Forecasting of the Instrument Transformer Using an ANN\nFIGURE 1. Radiographic image of a Dry-type medium voltage instrument\ntransformer for indoor service. (a) Transformer transverse view.\n(b) Transformer front view.\nand hot spots in transformers. Heat transfer phenomena in\nthe transformer involve thermal conduction, convection, and\nradiation; hence, a very complicated theoretical equation set\nis necessary to predict the temperature in transformers [3].\nThere are several research works reported in the literature\nregarding temperature in transformers, such as equivalent\ncircuit [7]–[9], ﬁnite element analysis-based modeling and\nsimulations [10]–[12], and experimental works [13]–[15].\nHowever, the operational properties of each transformer are\nsubject to its geometry, materials, electrical characteristics,\netc.\nIn [16], the authors proposed a method to forecast the\ntemperature of hot spots in oil-immersed transformer wind-\nings; it includes an ANN with only one hidden layer and a\nvalue of R very close to one; this ANN is used to predict\nthe transformer temperature in different hot spots. In our\nwork, we are considering a dry-type instrument transformer\nto forecast its hot spots, not only in windings but also in\ncore and internal insulation of transformer taking into account\nenvironmental conditions for ANN training, and we have\ndone lab studies with a transformer prototype manufactured\nfor this purpose. Moreover, to be able to ﬁnd the ANN with\nthe best performance, our search algorithm creates ANNs\nwith one to three hidden layers, and a sensitivity analysis was\ncarried out to identify the inﬂuence of input variables in the\nmodel.\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been applied\nfor modeling and analyzing different type of systems. The\nusage of an ANN for modeling transformers has advantages\nover some other techniques. For example, ANNs can han-\ndle several input and output variables of the system that is\nbeing modeled. In addition, highly complex classiﬁcation\nproblems can be solved with the study of heat transfer in a\nvery efﬁcient manner and in less processing time to provide a\nfeasible solution to the problem. It is achieved because ANNs\ncan separate non-linear decision regions as complicated as\ndesired depending on the number of neurons and layers with\na simple structure. Taking into account these advantages,\nit was decided to use ANN theory in this study because it\nallows the construction, modiﬁcation and representation of\ncomplex models without the need of advanced mathematical\nmodeling, and the results can be ideal for the study and/or\ndesign of transformers.\nNo paper has been published that uses an ANN to forecast\ntemperatures and hot spot in a dry-type instrument trans-\nformer considering all possible combinations of geomet-\nric, electrical and mechanical design variables, as a result,\nthis article describes a procedure for conﬁguring a thermal\nmodel in cast resin dry-type medium voltage instrument\ntransformers using ANNs. Therefore, the main contribution\nof this research is the methodology for obtaining ANNs with\na high performance for predicting the maximum tempera-\nture in the low and high voltage winding, core, transformer\nbody (epoxy resin), insulation between high and low voltage\n(paper), as well as the boundary between the transformer\nbody and the environment. The ANN model can be used to\nstudy the temperature distribution, and hot spots, providing\na tool that can help in designing medium voltage instrument\ntransformers.\nThe results of this methodology based on ANN are vali-\ndated by comparing them with ﬁnite element simulations and\nlaboratory tests carried out on a prototype built especially\nfor this research. The ANN model is accurate and efﬁcient\nenough for practical application at the design stage. Figure 2\nshows a ﬂowchart of the methodology used for this research\nwork, from the design of the transformer until the ANN\nvalidation.\nFIGURE 2. Flowchart of the methodology applied in this research work.\nThe rest of this article is structured in the following\norder. Firstly, the structure of a cast resin dry-type medium\nvoltage instrument transformer is described in section II.\nSection III presents the thermal models governing the temper-\nature behavior in transformers. In section IV , the heat sources\nof this type of transformers are identiﬁed. Section V describes\nthe modeling process for transformers through ﬁnite element\nmethod (FEM). The process to obtain the ANN with the best\nperformance is presented in section VI. Then, section VII\nshows the validation of the ANN in a physical model. Finally,\nsection VIII concludes the paper.\nII. THE TRANSFORMER GEOMETRY\nThe geometry of cast resin dry-type medium voltage instru-\nment transformer patented in [6], was manufactured for this\nresearch work. The geometrical arrangement of the trans-\nformer under study is shown in Figure 3. The magnetic core\nis made up of magnetic laminations of silicon steel forming\nVOLUME 8, 2020 164393\nE. A. Juarez-Balderaset al.: Hot-Spot Temperature Forecasting of the Instrument Transformer Using an ANN\na cross-section block, the primary and secondary windings\nare insulated with dielectric cardboard sheets. The secondary\nwinding is placed over a magnetic core, while the primary\nwinding is placed over the secondary winding. The insulation\nbetween high and low voltage windings is diamond-dotter\npaper and the core and the windings are encapsulated with\nepoxy resin [6].\nFIGURE 3. Geometric detail of the Dry-type medium voltage instrument\ntransformer for indoor service. (a) Front Cut. (b) transversal cut.\nBy taking into account the geometric dimensions obtained\nfrom the transformer design calculation algorithm, maxi-\nmum temperatures can be more accurately predicted. In this\nresearch work, the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the\ntransformer is considered. Additionally, a simple and easy-to-\noperate parametric design is carried out to adapt the geometri-\ncal characteristic of the components of the transformer under\nstudy. Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the paramet-\nric design system developed. The parameterization process\nincludes the extraction of geometric variables and parameters\nfrom the transformer calculation algorithm.\nParametric design is the basis for creating mathematical\nand geometric relationships that allows the deriving of auto-\nmated process variables and parameters. The parameters and\ninitial variables (electrical, magnetic, mechanical, geometric\nand environmental) will guide the generation of output vari-\nables (temperatures and hot spots in the transformer).\nIII. HEAT TRANSFER\nThe thermal models used to study the temperature distribution\nand to know the hot spots in the transformer have been\nanalyzed and developed in multiple engineering disciplines,\nsuch as electrical circuit theory, ﬂuid dynamics, numerical\nmethods, electromagnetic theory, etc. Each thermal model\nhas its own applications. However, these thermal models have\none thing in common, which is the study of heat propaga-\ntion. Radiation, convection, and conduction are considered\nthe fundamental pillars in the study of heat transfer in the\ntransformer [3], [17]; hence, a complex theoretical set of\nequations is required to predict temperature [3].\nFIGURE 4. Block diagram of the parametric design system.\nThe temperature distribution inside the cast resin dry-type\nmedium voltage instrument transformer manufactured for\nindoor service (Figure 1) can be obtained by solving (1) -\n(3), which are derived from the energy conservation law [18],\n[19].\nIn this study, we consider radiation, convection, conduction\nin steady state analysis to predict the temperature in the\ninstrument transformer. The initial temperature in the trans-\nformer body is considered to be the same as the environmental\ntemperature, and the heat convection and radiation, shown in\n(2) and (3), are used as boundary conditions [11], [18], [19].\ncρ∂T\n∂t = ∂\n∂x\n(\nk ∂T\n∂x\n)\n+ ∂\n∂y\n(\nk ∂T\n∂y\n)\n+∂\n∂z\n(\nk ∂T\n∂z\n)\n(1)\ndQconv\ndt =h(Ts −T∞) (2)\ndQrad\ndt =εσT 4\nS −αG (3)\nIn the stationary state, the term ∂T /∂t in equation (1) is\nequal to zero; therefore, equation (1) can be expressed as\nbelow [20]:\n∇2T(x,y,z) =Q\nk (4)\nwhere: k is the thermal conductivity (W/(m ◦C)), Q is the heat\nsource (W/m 3), ρis the mass density (kg/m 3), C is the spe-\nciﬁc heat (J/(kg◦C), T is the temperature (◦C), t is the time (s),\nQconv and Q rad are the rates of heat transfer per unit area on\nthe surface by convection and radiation (W/m 2), respectively,\nh is the convective heat transfer coefﬁcient (W/(m 2◦C), εis\nthe emissivity of the surface, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann’s con-\nstant (W/(m2 ◦C4)), αis the absorptivity, G is the irradiation\n(W/m2), Ts is the surface temperature ( ◦C) and T∞ is the\nenvironment temperature.\nAt the same time, natural convection occurs due to the\nbuoyancy forces caused by differences in ﬂuid density due\nto temperature variation. That is why the convective heat\n164394 VOLUME 8, 2020\nE. A. Juarez-Balderaset al.: Hot-Spot Temperature Forecasting of the Instrument Transformer Using an ANN\ntransfer coefﬁcient h depends on the geometry of the trans-\nformer surface. In addition, thermal radiation is calculated\nby differentiating the energy emitted on the surface of the\ntransformer (solid) from the energy incident on the surface\n(ambient temperature). Emissivity and absorptivity in equa-\ntion (3) are the surface properties determined according to\nthe geometry and material of the surface. However, the heat\nsources described in equation (1), and equation (2) represent\nuniform heating due to core losses and winding losses; the\nheat generation per unit volume can also be obtained by\nequation (5) [21], [22].\nQ =P\nV (5)\nwhere: Q is the heat source (W/m 3), P is the loss in the core\nand in the windings (W), and V is the volume of the heat\nsource (m3).\nIV. HEAT SOURCES IN THE TRANSFORMER\nIn dry-type medium voltage instrument transformers such as\nthe one illustrated in Figure 1, the primary and secondary\nwindings are made of copper; hence, they offer high thermal\nconductivity [10].\nIn addition, once the transformer is energized and exposed\nto environmental temperature, the energy losses in these com-\nponents (core and windings), and together with convection\nand solar radiation from the atmosphere in the transformer\nbody, heat-generating sources are established inside and out-\nside the transformer [23]–[25].\nFigure 5 illustrates the heat sources inside the cast resin\ndry-type medium voltage instrument transformer manufac-\ntured for indoor service.\nThe energy losses in high voltage winding (equation (6))\nand low voltage winding (equation (7)) can be obtained inde-\npendently considering the winding geometry, length, cross-\nsection resistance and resistivity of the conductive material\n[26]. In addition, for a transformer, the sum of copper losses\ncan be obtained by equation (8) [27], [28].\nPcu1 =R1I2\n1 =ρ1\n(l1\ns1\n)\nI2\n1 (6)\nPcu2 =R2I2\n2 =ρ2\n(l2\ns2\n)\nI2\n2 (7)\nPcu =\nn=2∑\ni=1\nPcui (8)\nwhere: Pcu1 are the primary winding losses (W), Pcu2 are\nthe secondary winding losses (W), Pcu represent the total\nwinding losses due to the Joule effect (W), R1 is the resistance\nof the conductor material in the primary winding (), R2\nis the resistance of the conductor material in the secondary\nwinding (), ρ1 is the resistivity of the conductor in the\nprimary winding (.m), ρ2 is the resistivity of the conduc-\ntor in the secondary winding (.m), l1 is the length of the\nconductor in the primary winding (m), l2 is the length of the\nconductor in the secondary winding (m), S1 is the conductor\ncross sectional area in the primary winding (m 2), S2 is the\nconductor cross sectional area in the secondary winding (m 2),\nI1 is the current in the primary winding (A), and I2 is the\ncurrent in the secondary winding (A). The core losses depend\non the material type (Silicon Steel, Amorphous, Crystalline\nNano, etc.), the frequency, material thickness and the ﬂux\ndensity at which it operates; these losses are given by equation\n(9) [29], [30].\nFIGURE 5. Sources of heat generated inside the instrument transformer\nof medium voltage dry-type cast resin manufactured for indoor service.\nPc =kcBαf B (9)\nwhere: Pc is the speciﬁc core losses (Watts/kg), B is the mag-\nnetic ﬂux density (T), f is the frequency (Hz), the constant kc,\nα, B, can be established from the datasheets of the material\nmanufacturer [30]. Moreover, the core losses are classically\ncomposed of hysteresis losses and eddy current losses, which\ncan be expressed by equation (10).\nPC =Ph +Pe =δhfB2 +δef 2B2 (10)\nwhere: Ph are the hysteresis losses in the core (W), Pe are the\neddy current losses in the core (W), δh and δe are constants\nwhich are material depend, and f is the frequency (Hz).\nFor this study, we use the loss curve at 60 Hz (reported\nin [5], [31]) in the calculation algorithm of the transformer\ndesign to determine the losses in the core.\nTransformer losses can be expressed by equation (11) [3].\nP =Pcu +PC (11)\nwhere: P are the total losses of the transformer (W), Pcu is the\ntotal winding losses due to the Joule effect (W) and PC is the\ncore losses (W).\nV. MODELING THROUGH FINITE ELEMENT METHOD\nDuring a stable electrical load in the medium voltage instru-\nment transformer (Figure 1), the internal losses (equation\n11) and the heat generated by the environment (equations\nVOLUME 8, 2020 164395\nE.

For\nthermal analysis, a 3D model of the transformer geometry is\nimplemented and the temperature distribution and hot spots\nare simulated.\nThe FEM is used to solve the equations of stable state\nenergy, i.e. equations (1) to (4) are solved, for obtaining\nthe thermal behavior of heat transfer and the hot spots in\nthe internal parts of the transformer and in the transformer\nhousing.\nThe FEM has some advantages in the modeling of complex\nsystems, such as modeling of complex geometries, bound-\nary conditions can be easily incorporated, different types\nof materials can be incorporated into the modeling, each\ndomain of geometry can be applied elements of different\norder, among others. However, it has some drawbacks, such\nas a large amount of data is required as input to generate\nthe mesh, it depends on a nodal connectivity and parameters\ndepending on the type of problem, it requires a computer\nof great capacity to give solution to the equations of each\nnode, among others. Notwithstanding the drawbacks, FEM\nhas features that helps in the modeling of dry-type instrument\ntransformers.\nFor the analysis, the heat transfer module of COMSOL\nMultiphysics® software was used. The software is based on\nsolving the heat transfer problem according to the param-\neters and variables deﬁned in the instrument transformer\ncalculation algorithm. Moreover, the software internally per-\nformed the matrix representation for each transformer ele-\nment, the formation of the global coefﬁcient matrix, and the\napplication of the initial and boundary conditions to solve the\nthermal problem [21].\nBy using a computer program implemented in COMSOL\nMultiphysics®, several simulations were carried out modify-\ning the electrical and geometric characteristics of the trans-\nformer.\nConsidering that transformers, like all electrical and elec-\ntronic equipment, is constantly being modernized and that in\nthe industry transformers of different shapes, sizes, materials,\ncore conﬁgurations, dielectric distances, etc. are designed,\nmanufactured and marketed, and are subjected to different\nenvironmental conditions, it was decided to take for this\ninvestigation the primary input variables that are part of the\ndesign requirement for an instrument transformer.\nTable 1 shows the properties of the materials associated\nwith the 3D computational model of the transformer geome-\ntry [32], while Table 2 and Table 3 show the input and output\nvariables that are introduced into the proposed computational\nprogram to provide a solution to the heat transfer model in\nthe instrument transformer.\nAccording to statistics presented in [33] about the failure\nlocation distribution, the major failure sources in transform-\ners come from the winding and core (>40%). In this article,\nwe are focused in seven variables related to temperature,\nthe maximum temperature in the internal parts of the trans-\nformer (Y1 to Y4), the maximum and minimum resin temper-\nature (Y5 and Y6, respectively), and the maximum temperature\nin the contour of the transformer (Y 7) that is in contact\nwith the atmosphere. These temperatures are correlated to\ntransformer features and environment temperature, grouped\nin twenty-six variables described in Table 2. In addition,\nthe determination of Y7 is of great importance because they\ncan be estimated for the measurement of the ohmic resistance\nin the thermal test of the transformer and, at the same time,\nthe maximum temperature rise in the primary and secondary\nwinding can be forecasted by using the method of resistance\nvariation.\nIn this article, 792 simulations were performed combining\nthe input parameters, whose ranges are shown in the third\ncolumn of Table 2. The materials are considered isotropic in\nall simulations. In addition, copper was used in the windings\nand silicon steel for the core, and the loss curve (60 Hz)\nreported in [5] was also considered.\nFigure 6 shows the tetrahedral mesh in all domains of the\ntransformer including the environment (2’693,508 tetrahe-\ndral elements in all domains). Figure 7 shows some of the\nresults of the simulations obtained and the computer program\ndesigned to automatically modify the electrical and geometric\ncharacteristics of the transformer. It also visualizes the ther-\nmal behaviors in a stable state with different environmental\ntemperatures.\nFIGURE 6.

In addition, ANNs are able\nto learn and have been successfully used in a wide spectrum\nof applications [35].\nDespite an ANN has some drawbacks, such as an unex-\nplained behavior of the network, the identiﬁcation of the cor-\nrect structure, the hardware dependence, among others, it has\nmany advantages. ANNs can create models with incomplete\nknowledge, are fault tolerant, have distributed memory and\nparallel processing capability, among others.\nIn this section, the design of an ANN is presented. The\nobtained ANN has the ability to predict the maximum tem-\nperature in the components of the resin cast dry-type medium\nvoltage instrument transformer, manufactured for indoor ser-\nvice.\nThe ANN design was developed using the Neural Net-\nwork Toolbox in MATLAB ®. A script was implemented for\nsearching the optimal conﬁguration of neurons and hidden\nlayers to minimize the Mean Square Error (MSE) and obtain\na correlation curve (R) between input and output data.\nThe number of neurons (NN) per layer and the number\nof hidden layers (HL) give the guideline to perform several\npossible combinations in search of an optimized topology,\nwhere the MSE should be near zero and R between the input\nand output data should be close to one. It is important to note\nthat in a multi-layer perceptron topology all the layers are\nconnected to each other, as shown in Figure 10.\nThe input data used for the ANN design corresponds to\nthe variables and parameters of the transformer design repre-\nsented in Table 1. This data and the results of the COMSOL\nMultiphysics® simulations were saved in a database and used\nto train and validate the ANNs generated in Matlab ®.\nIn order to have a wide spectrum of possibilities, in this\nresearch work we have analyzed ANNs which contain one,\ntwo or three hidden layers. Equation (12) was used to esti-\nmate the number of all possible combinations for the ANN\nconﬁguration. Considering from one to ten the NN per each\nHL, with one HL we have 10 possibilities, with two HLs\nwe get 100 ANNs, and so on. In this research work, a total\nof 1110 ANNs were trained using three HLs as maximum.\nThe learning algorithm considered in the ANN design is\nderived from the Least-Mean-Square (LMS), principle where\nthe MSE is determined as the result of the difference between\nthe target output and the network output (Equation 13) [16],\n[36].\nj =\nHL∑\nk=1\n(NN)k (12)\nMSE = 1\nm\nm∑\ni=1\n(ti −yi)2 (13)\nThe learning algorithm LMS has set of samples of the\ndesired behavior: {x1,t1},{x2,t2},... {xm,tm}where the aim\nis to reduce the average sum of these errors; moreover,\nthe LMS algorithm environment sets the weight and bias of\nthe network to reduce the MSE [16], [36]; in this case, xm\nVOLUME 8, 2020 164397\nE.

The block diagram proposed to generate the simulation results and stored in a database.\nvalues are the network inputs, and tm values are the respective\ntargets. For every input in the net, the output is compared with\nthe target [36].\nThe training process of the ANN starts with random\nweights, which are adjusted iteratively to reduce the MSE.\nThe set of weights that minimize the error function is con-\nsidered a solution to the system that represents the ANN\n[36]. Figure 11 shows the ﬂowchart of the algorithm devel-\noped in MATLAB to implement the thermal behavior of the\ninstrument transformer; and Figure 12 shows the obtained\nANN, considering the twenty-six input variables and the\nseven output variables shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The\nsize of the database consists of 792 simulations based on the\nFEM, that is, 792 records obtained from the same number\nof simulations. The inputs and outputs of these simulations\nwere used to build the database used for the ANNs training.\nThere was not necessary to normalize these data for the ANN\ntraining process due to the obtained ANNs showed a good\nperformance from the original range of values. The conﬁg-\nuration for the ANN with the best performance is (10:9:9),\ni.e., ten neurons in the ﬁrst hidden layer and nine neurons in\nthe second and the third ones.\n164398 VOLUME 8, 2020\nE. A. Juarez-Balderaset al.: Hot-Spot Temperature Forecasting of the Instrument Transformer Using an ANN\nFIGURE 9. Flowchart of the proposed computational program to generate\nand save the simulation results.\nThe input data used to obtain the ANNs were divided into\nthree groups: training data set (70%), veriﬁcation data set\n(15%) and validation data set (15%). The sigmoid function is\nused in all layers to update weight and bias values according\nto Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. This\nFIGURE 10. Multi-layer perceptron topology of ANN implemented for\ntemperature study of cast-resin transformer.\nfunction has been utilized widely in several applications of\nANNs because of its effectiveness and rapidness in the back-\npropagation algorithm. On the other hand, a linear function is\nused in the output layer.\nThe results of ANN training are shown in Figures 13 and\n14. Figure 13 shows the performance of the ANN training\nprocess with a MSE of 0.003455 in 1000 epochs. Figure 14\nshows the correlation between the ANN outputs and the data\nused as targets, R =1 proves the linearity of the RNA model.\nThe values predicted by the best qualiﬁed ANN for output\nvariables were compared against the values obtained from\nCOMSOL Multiphysics ®. Figures 15 to 21 show the corre-\nlation between these values. It can be observed, in a graphical\nway, that the ANN predicts the temperature values of the\nseven variables of interest very close to those obtained by sim-\nulation. This fact is a good evidence that ANNs can be used to\nforecast the temperature behavior in transformers with high\ncertainty. Table 4 shows the MSE for each value obtained\nfrom the ANN. Due to the high range of possibilities in\ntransformer design with respect to its inputs, the temperatures\nwere plotted with regard to the volume of each transformer\ncomponent (Figure 15 to Figure 20) and superﬁcially with\nregard to the boundary between the transformer body and the\nenvironment (Figure 21)\nTABLE 4. MSE between the values calculated in COMSOL Multiphysics®\nand the values obtained from the ANN for each output variable.\nA.

After that,\nwe predict the output values omitting one input variable,\nthen we obtain the corresponding MSE. This step is repeated\nfor each input variable to determine its respective MSEi.\nEquation 14 is used to calculate the sensitivity of the model\nfor every input variable.\nSi =MSEi\nMSE (14)\nwhere: Si: Sensitivity of the model to variable xi; MSEi:\nMSE of predicted values without data for input variable xi;\nMSE: is the mean square error of predicted values taking into\naccount all the input variables.

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION\nA physical model was manufactured in order to validate the\noutput data predicted by the ANN with the best performance.\nA heating test was performed on a cast resin dry-type medium\nvoltage instrument transformer manufactured for indoor ser-\nvice with similar characteristics shown in Figure 1, Figure 3\nand Table 1. The standards IEC 61869-1 and IEC 61869-\n3 were followed during the heating tests. The instruments\nused in the test were: an ac voltage variator, a reactor, mercury\nthermometers, pyrometers and digital multimeters, as well as\na digital hydro thermometer clock and type J thermocouples\nwith ﬁberglass lining and stainless-steel mesh. Figure 23\nshows the instrument transformer of cast resin medium volt-\nage manufactured for indoor service at the time the heating\ntest is applied. The transformer was similar to those provided\nfor indoor service. Figure 24 shows the heating test diagram.\n164400 VOLUME 8, 2020\nE. A.

In all the cases, stable thermal conditions were\nachieved, i.e., stabilization was obtained when the temper-\nature difference of the thermocouples on the transformer\nresin wall and the average temperatures with respect to the\nFIGURE 16.

Maximum temperature obtained from the ANN with input\nvariables indicated in Table 7.\nFIGURE 27. Maximum temperature obtained from the heating test and\nthe proposed ANN with input variables from Table 7.\nthe ANNs with the best performance were validated with the\ndata obtained from a physical model manufactured for this\npurpose. This methodology is the main contribution of this\nresearch article. The dependence of a lab and the transformer\nmanufacturing is the unique limitation in this proposal, but\nwith data obtained from simulations developed in COMSOL\nthe ANNs can be validated. The best ANN shows accurate\nprediction with a MSE average of 2.71% with respect to the\nthermal tests. With the use of a large number of inputs in\nthe design of the ANN in conjunction with the algorithm\nimplemented to vary the number of hidden layers and the\nnumber of neurons for each hidden layer, we got an ANN\nwith good performance (mean quadratic error =0.003455)\nand a great correlation in the input/output data (R =1). The\nvariation of temperatures obtained from ﬁnite element sim-\nulations and those obtained from the ANN are very similar,\nand there is also a similarity pattern that depends on the volu-\nmetric and superﬁcial dimensioning of each component of the\ntransformer. Moreover, a transformer was manufactured in a\nlaboratory of Arteche North America S.A. de C.V . in order to\nvalidate the results produced by the ANN, obtaining a MSE\nequal to 2.71%. With the results of this research work, the best\nANN can be used together with optimization techniques to\nimprove the efﬁciency and reliability of dry-type instrument\ntransformers. As future work, this ANN will be used as the\nﬁtness function in an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the\ndesign of transformers.\nAPPENDIX\nNomenclature\n3D Three-dimension\nANN Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\nFEM Finite Element Method\nHL Hidden layers\nLMS Least-Mean-Square\nMSE Mean Square Error\nNN Neurons per layer\nε Emissivity of the surface (dimensionless quantity)\nσ Stefan Boltzmann’s constant (W/(m 2 ◦C4))\nα Absorptivity of the surface (dimensionless\nquantity)\nC Speciﬁc heat (J/(kg ◦C)\nf Frequency (Hz)\nH Convective heat transfer coefﬁcient (W/(m 2 ◦C)\nI1 Current in the primary winding (A)\nI2 Current in the secondary winding (A)\nk Thermal conductivity (W/(m ◦C))\nl1 Length of the primary winding conductor (m)\nl2 Length of the secondary winding conductor (m)\nMSEi Mean Square Error of predicted values without\ndata for input variable Xi\nP Total losses of the transformer (W)\nPc Total core losses (Watts/kg)\nPcu Total winding losses due to the Joule effect (W)\nPcu1 Primary winding losses (W)\nPcu2 Secondary winding losses (W)\nPe Eddy current losses in the core (W)\nPh Hysteresis losses in the core (W)\nQ Heat source (W/m 3)\nQconv Heat transfer source per convection (W/m 2)\nQrad Heat transfer source per radiation (W/m 2)\nR Correlation between input and output data\nR1 Resistance of the primary winding conductor ()\nR2 Resistance of the secondary winding conductor\n()\nS1 Conductor cross sectional area in the primary\nwinding (m2)\nS2 Conductor cross sectional area in the secondary\nwinding (m2)\nSi Sensitivity of the model to variable Xi\nT Temperature (◦C)\nt Time (s)\n164404 VOLUME 8, 2020\nE.
