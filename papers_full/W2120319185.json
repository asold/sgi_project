    "abstract": "This paper describes the results of a process whereby the detection capability of 5 code replication detection tools for large software application are evaluated. Specifically this work focuses on the benefits of identification for preventative maintenance that is with the aim to remove some of the identified clones from the source code. A number of requirements are therefore identified upon which the tools are evaluated. The results of the analysis processes show that each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses and no single tool is able to identify all clones within the code. The paper proposes that it may be possible to use a combination of tools to perform the analysis process providing that adequate means of efficiently identifying false matches is found.",
