INTRODUCTION \nANDSLIDES represent one of the most devastating \nnatural phenomena worldwide, posing a grave threat to \nhuman life, property, and regional sustainable \ndevelopment [1], [2]. Landslide susceptibility refers to the \nspatial likelihood of landslides, which is determined by \nconsidering regional geological and environmental factors \nalongside historical landslide occurrences [3]. As a result, \nlandslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) provides valuable data \nfor government agencies involved in land planning and the \ndevelopment of effective disaster mitigation strategies [4]. \nWith the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), \nnumerous researchers have tested various machine learning \n(ML) algorithms in LSM tasks in the past two decades [5]-[8]. \nML algorithms possess the capability to automatically discern \npatterns from landslide data, allowing them to model complex, \nnonlinear relationships [9]. Nonetheless, ML algorithms also \nexhibit certain limitations, such as their reliance on feature \nengineering and the potential risks of overfitting and \nunderfitting.  \nDeep learning (DL) algorithms, as a branch of ML \nalgorithms, have demonstrated outstanding performance in \nimage-related tasks [10]-[12]. By training in large-scale \nparallel computing environments, DL models have the \ncapacity to automatically capture complex relationships \nbetween landslides and landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) \nand extract high-dimensional landslide features. This \nadvantage has encouraged researchers to apply DL models in \nLSM studies with notable successes [13]-[15]. However, the \ntwo most popular DL models currently: convolutional neural \nnetwork (CNN) and Transformer, each have their own distinct \nadvantages and limitations when it comes to landslide feature \nL\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

Due to the spatial \ntranslation invariance and low inductive bias of convolutions, \nCNN-based models could extract landslide local features \n(LLFs) efficiently from multi-source remote sensing images \n[21]. However, the limited receptive field of CNN-based \nmodels restricts their ability to process extensive contextual \ninformation, resulting in challenges in capturing landslide \nglobal features (LGFs)  [22]. \nTransformer is an encoder-decoder sequence transformation \nmodel that utilizes the self-attention (SA) mechanism to \nexpand the receptive field to capture global contextual \ninformation. One notable application is Vision Transformer \n(ViT), which successfully employs the pure Transformer \nbackbone for image classification tasks [23], leading to \ncompetitive performance in LSM tasks [24]. The SA \nmechanism calculates the correlations and weights between \neach pixel and all other pixels in the image, which allows the \nTransformer to better extract LGFs compared to CNN [25]. \nHowever, Transformer-based models have relatively weak \nLLFs extraction capabilities and typically require training with \nextensive large-scale data [26]. \nIn LSM tasks, both LGFs and LLFs play crucial roles. The \nLGFs encompass key aspects, including the size, location, and \nspatial distribution of landslides. Conversely, the LLFs pertain \nto specific characteristics such as the edges, texture, and shape \nof the landslides. The strong LGFs and LLFs could enable the \nmodel to better distinguish pixels that exhibit subtle \ndifferences between landslides and non-landslides, thereby \nimproving the accuracy of the LSM. It is important to note \nthat CNN and Transformer have complementary advantages in \nextracting LGFs and LLFs [16]. Numerous researchers have \nintroduced the combination of CNN and Transformer models \ninto various tasks, including scene classification [27], \nsemantic segmentation [28], and change detection [29]. The \nfindings indicate that the CNN-Transformer hybrid framework \ncan effectively extract both local and global features of an \nimage, which improves the overall performance and reduces \nthe Transformer's dependence on large-scale training datasets \n[29]. However, there are no studies evaluated the effectiveness \nof hybrid CNN and Transformer models in LSM tasks. \nTaking into account the distinctive strengths of CNN in \nextracting LLFs and Transformer in modeling LGFs, we \nintroduce a CNN-Transformer Local-Global features \nextraction network (CTLGNet) designed specifically for LSM \ntasks. By leveraging the combined advantages of CNN and \nTransformer models, the network adeptly extracts both LGFs \nand LLFs to improve the accuracy of the LSM. The main \ncontributions of this article are outlined as follows: (1) We \nutilize CNN structure to extract LLFs from the input data, and \nthen use Transformer structure to extract LGFs from the \noutput features of the CNN. The CTLGNet can \ncomprehensively extract LLFs and LGFs, improving the \nspatial prediction of landslides. (2) We conduct a comparative \nanalysis of the CTLGNet and individual models, evaluating \ntheir respective capabilities in extracting LLFs and LGFs from \nseveral evaluation perspectives. Furthermore, we compare the \ncomputational effort of the different models.  \nII. STUDY AREA AND DATA \nA. Study area \nIn order to validate the universality and reliability of the \nproposed model, this study opted for two landslide-prone areas \nas study areas, namely: (1) Three Gorges Reservoir Area, (2) \nJiuzhaigou. These areas boast distinct geological structures \nand geographical features, providing ample evidence to \nshowcase the model’s performance and applicability. \nSite A: Three Gorges Reservoir area \nSite A is located in the section from Zigui to Badong in the \nThree Gorges Reservoir area in western Hubei Province, \nChina, including parts of Zigui County of Yichang City and \nBadong County of Enshi Prefecture (Fig. 1(a)). The whole \nzone is located from 30°1’12” N to 30°55’48” N, 110°18’0” E \nto 110°52’12” E, with a total area of about 396 km2. The \nYangtze River flows through the site in the WNW-ESE \ndirection. \n Fig.1. Location of Site A. (a) Geographical location of Site A. \n(b) Distribution of landslides in Site A. (c) Three-dimensional \ntopography of Site A. \nThe landslides distribution and three-dimensional \ntopography of Site A are shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c) \nrespectively. Site A belongs to the subtropical monsoon \nclimate, characterized by hot summers and cold winters, with \nfour distinct seasons. Precipitation mainly concentrates in June \nto September, with an average annual rainfall of 1100 mm and \nprone to heavy rainfall. In terms of topography and \ngeomorphology, Site A has a rugged surface which is very \nfavorable to the formation and development of landslides. The \nfaults in the area are widely developed and the lithology is \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

As \none of the most important water conservancy projects in China, \nit is important to assess the probability of landslide occurrence \nin Site A.  \nSite B: Jiuzhaigou \nSite B is located in Jiuzhaigou County, Aba Tibetan and \nQiang Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China (Fig. \n2(a)). The whole zone is located from 32°54’15” N to \n33°24’19” N, 103°38’19” E to 104°04’20” E, with a total area \nof about 1367 km2. \n Fig.2. Location of Site B. (a) Geographical location of Site B. \n(b) Distribution of landslides in Site B. (c) Three-dimensional \ntopography of Site B. \nFig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(c) depict the distribution of landslides \nand the three-dimensional topography of Site B, respectively. \nSite B belongs to the highland humid climate, which has less \nprecipitation and is mostly concentrated in July and August. \nAs the transition zone between the Tibetan Plateau and the \nSichuan Basin, Site B is characterized by high peaks, deep \nvalleys and steep terrain. The topography of the area is high in \nthe south and low in the north, with a relative elevation \ndifference of more than 2,000 meters. Site B has complex \ngeological background and strong tectonic movement, which \nhas facilitated the development of geological hazards. On \nAugust 8, 2017, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in \nJiuzhaigou County, Sichuan Province, resulting in multiple \nlandslide disasters in Site B, posing a significant threat to local \nresidents and tourists (Fig. 2(b)). Therefore, accurate LSM is \nof great importance to people’s safety in Site B. \nB. Landslide inventory map \nThe drawing of landslide inventory map can visually \ndisplay the distribution of landslides and create labels to input \ninto the model for training. The landslide inventory map of \nSite A was mainly constructed by referring to the historical \nlandslide data, combined with remote sensing images and on-\nsite field survey data. And the landslide inventory data of Site \nB are mainly from landslide history documentation and visual \ninterpretation of Google Earth images. Specifically, there are \n202 landslides in Site A, with a total area of about 23.40 km2, \nmost of which are reservoir bank landslides, mainly along \nboth sides of the main stream of Yangtze River. In Site B, \nthere are more than 4000 landslides distributed, with a total \narea of about 9.51 km2. The landslides are small in area and \nmainly concentrated in the west and central part of the Site B. \nC. Landslide conditioning factors \nThe basic assumption of landslide susceptibility is that \nlandslides will occur in areas with similar geological and \nenvironmental conditions to historical landslides, so the \nselection of LCFs is critical for LSM. LCFs typically contain \nfactors for topography and geomorphology, geology, \nhydrology, and ground cover [7]. Taking into account \nprevious studies on the study area and the availability of data \n[30], we finally selected nine LCFs: elevation, aspect, slope, \nlithology, distance from fault (DTF), distance from river \n(DTR), precipitation, land use/land cover (LULC) and \nnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). \nTABLE I \nDETAILED VALUES OF LANDSLIDE CONDITIONAL FACTORS \nLCFs Site A Site B \nElevation(m) [80, 2000] [1603, 4787] \nAspect Flat, North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, \nSouthwest, West, Northwest \nSlope(°) [0, 78.42] [0, 78.00] \nLithology Soft rock,  \nSoft and hard, Hard rock \nQuaternary, Neogene, \nTriassic, Permian, \nCarboniferous, Devonian \nDTF(m) [0, 8753.58] [0, 7728.60] \nDTR(m) [0, 4706.22] [0, 6423.22] \nPrecipitation \n(mm) [274.6, 320.9] [104.0, 133.5] \nLULC Cropland, Forest, Shrub, Grassland, Water, Snow/Ice, \nBarren, Impervious, Wetland \nNDVI [-1, 1] [-1, 1] \nThe initial three LCFs were derived from the Digital \nElevation Model (DEM), sourced from http://www.gscloud.cn. \nLithology and fault data were procured through vectorization \nfrom the 1:200,000 scale geological map database available at \nthe National Geological Archive \n(http://www.ngac.org.cn/Map/List).

METHODOLOGY \nFirstly, we identify nine geo-environmental factors as LCFs \nand perform multicollinearity and importance analyses on the \nLCFs. Next, we generate landslide datasets by generating \npatch blocks from pixels. These datasets are then randomly \ndivided into training, validation, and test sets using a 6:2:2 \nratio. Then, CNN, ResNet, DenseNet, ViT, FrIT and \nCTLGNet are constructed to generate LSM. Lastly, we \ncompare and evaluate model accuracy and generalization \nabilities. The detailed flowchart is shown in Fig. 3. \nA. Data Preprocessing \nThe data preprocessing in this study involves several key \nsteps, including coordinate system unification, resampling, \nand image standardization. Initially, we standardized the \ncoordinate systems for all the data. Recognizing the variations \nin spatial resolution among different geospatial data types, we \nutilized bilinear interpolation for resampling to unify the \nspatial resolution [31]. This ensured consistency in the number \nof rows and columns in LCFs. To eliminate the difference in \nmagnitude between discrete and continuous factors and \naccelerate model convergence, the Z-score method was \nemployed to standardize the images of LCFs [32].  \n Fig.3. Flow chart of this study. \nB. LCFs selection \nDuring the LSM process, it is critical to ensure the relative \nindependence and importance of the selected LCFs. The \npresence of strong multicollinearity between LCFs or low \nimportance of LCFs may adversely affect computational \nefficiency and lead to unstable and inaccurate models. \nTherefore, it is necessary to conduct multicollinearity analysis \nand importance evaluation on LCFs before constructing the \nlandslide datasets [33]. \n1) Multicollinearity Analysis: In order to further evaluate \nthe correlation among LCFs, we performed a multicollinearity \nanalysis on the factors. Multicollinearity can be assessed using \nthe Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Tolerance (TOL). The \nmathematical expression for VIF is as follows: \nVIF = ଵ\nଵିோ೔మ                                       (2) \nBy utilizing 𝑋 = {𝑥1, 𝑥2,..., 𝑥𝑛}, we establish an independent \ndataset for variables, where 𝑅௜ଶ signifies the coefficient of \ndetermination for the ith independent variable, 𝑋𝑖, when it is \nregressed on all other predictor variables within the model. \nTOL represents the reciprocal of the VIF value in numerical \nterms. In general, if the VIF is less than 10, it suggests a low \nlevel of multicollinearity among the data. If the VIF falls \nbetween 10 and 100, it indicates the presence of strong \nmulticollinearity. A VIF value of 100 or higher suggests \nsevere multicollinearity. \n2) Importance Evaluation: In order to measure the \nimportance of each LCF for the occurrence of landslides, this \nstudy conducted an importance evaluation of nine LCFs in \nSite A and Site B by calculating the Gini index in the Random \nForest model [34]. The higher value of the Gini coefficient of \na LCF indicates that the LCF is more important to the model, \nand the sum of the Gini Index of all LCFs should be equal to 1. \nC. Landslide Dataset Construction \nAfter data preprocessing and LCFs selection, the LCFs are \nstacked into a three-dimensional matrix (H, W, C), where H \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

In the entire region, a landslide pixel is \nrandomly chosen as the center of a patch block. The block is \nthen expanded in the H, W, and C directions, resulting in a \nlandslide patch block with size of 72 × 72 × 9. A total of \n10,000 landslide patch blocks are generated for both Site A \nand B, which constructs a landslide dataset for LSM. And an \nequal number of non-landslide patch blocks are generated \nusing the same steps for the training, validation, and test sets. \nMaintaining a consistent ratio of positive and negative \nsamples, the landslide dataset is randomly divided into \ntraining, validation, and test sets in a 6:2:2 ratio. Finally, in \norder to further enrich sample diversity and enhance model \nperformance, various techniques such as random horizontal \nflipping, random rotation, and local random scaling are \napplied to the training set during the data augmentation while \nkeeping the patch block size unchanged, which were then \ninput into all LSM models constructed below for training. \nD. CNN-based models \n1) CNN: The earliest CNN model, LeNet-5, was introduced \nin the 1990s for handwritten digit recognition [35]. CNN \nnetworks possess characteristics such as local perception, \nparameter sharing, and translation invariance, enabling them \nto effectively extract and utilize LLFs from input data [36]. As \na result, CNNs have found wide-ranging applications in \ncomputer vision (CV) tasks and have achieved remarkable \nbreakthroughs in the field of LSM [37], [38]. \nIn this study, we constructed a ten-layer CNN network \nfor LSM using two-dimensional convolutional kernels. The \narchitecture comprises two convolutional layers with a kernel \nsize of 3 × 3, two max pooling layers, two ReLU activation \nfunctions layers, a batch normalization (BN) layer, and a fully \nconnected layer. The CNN structure could extract high-\ndimensional landslide features through convolution and \npooling layers, obtaining relatively excellent LSM results. \n2) ResNet: ResNet is designed to address the problems of \nnetwork degradation and gradient vanishing encountered \nduring the training of deep networks [17]. ResNet introduces \nthe concept of residual learning, wherein the input feature \nmaps of each residual module are added to the feature maps \nobtained after a series of convolution operations, creating a \nresidual connection. This innovative design of skip \nconnections enables the network to directly learn residuals \nwithout relying solely on gradual learning through multiple \nlayers. ResNet architectures typically consist of multiple \nstacked residual modules [33]. Each residual module \ncomprises two convolutional layers for feature extraction and \na skip connection that adds the input features to the output \nfeatures, facilitating the learning process. \nIn this article, we employed ResNet18 to build the LSM \nmodel, utilizing an architecture consisting of 18 layers within \na deep convolutional neural network. ResNet18's residual \nblocks could facilitate the training of deeper networks and \nensure that landslide features are propagated and retained \nmore efficiently. \n3) DenseNet: DenseNet is designed to address the \nchallenges of gradient vanishing and feature reuse during the \ntraining of deep networks [18]. Unlike traditional CNNs, \nDenseNet introduces dense connections and skip connections, \nachieving superior network performance. DenseNet takes a \ndifferent approach by establishing dense connections, where \neach layer is connected to all previous layers, forming a dense \nconnection structure [34]. This architecture ensures that each \nlayer has direct access to the feature maps of all preceding \nlayers, enabling more comprehensive and rich information \nflow throughout the network. The network structure of \nDenseNet comprises multiple dense blocks, with each dense \nblock consisting of multiple convolutional layers and a feature \nfusion layer known as the transition layer. The transition layer \nplays a vital role in controlling the dimensionality of feature \nmaps and reducing computational complexity. \nIn this study, DenseNet-BC (DenseNet with Bottleneck and \nCompression) was used to obtain LSM results. This variant \nincorporates Bottleneck and Compression operations, \neffectively reducing the dimensionality of the landslide feature \nmap and enhancing the overall performance of DenseNet. \nE. Transformer-based model \n1) ViT: Building upon the success of the Transformer in \nNLP, Google introduced ViT in 2020, marking the extension \nof Transformer’s application to the field of CV for the first \ntime [23]. Unlike traditional models, ViT takes a unique \napproach by treating images as one-dimensional sequences to \nextract features. To begin with, ViT divides the input image \ninto a collection of patch blocks and subsequently flattens \neach block into a vector. These vectors serve as the input for \nthe model. An embedding layer then maps these input vectors \nto a high-dimensional feature space, and these transformed \nvectors undergo processing through multiple layers of \nencoders. Within these encoders, the SA layer and the feed-\nforward neural network layer work in tandem to extract the \nimage’s global features. Finally, the output vector from the \nlast position is taken as the image’s feature representation, \nresulting in the classification outcome [39]-[40].  \nWe used the original VIT structure to extract landslide \nfeatures and implement the LSM task. The configuration \nincludes four attention heads and eight Transformer layers.  \nThe VIT model proves effective in capturing LGFs across the \ninput sequence while emphasizing key areas within the input \nimage. \n2) FrIT: In response to the lack of global contextual \ninformation in CNN and the loss of local semantic information \nin VIT, the Fractional Fourier Image Transformer (FrIT) was \nproposed. FrIT has demonstrated success in capturing both \nglobal and local contextual features [41]. Different from VIT \nwhich is based on self-attention mechanism, FrIT extracts \nglobal contexts based on 2-D fractional Fourier transform \n(FrFT) layers. Other than that, the structure of FrIT remaining \nparts is basically the same as that of VIT. We migrated the \nFrIT to the LSM task and conducted a comparative analysis \nagainst the network proposed in our study. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

Framework of landslide susceptibility mapping based on CTLGNet. \nF. CTLGNet \nTo address the limitations of feature extraction capabilities \nin CNN-based and Transformer-based models and enhance the \nlandslide spatial prediction accuracy by simultaneously \nextracting LGFs and LLFs, we propose a hybrid model called \nCNN-Transformer Local-Global Features Extraction Network \n(CTLGNet) for LSM tasks. Fig. 4 illustrates the specific \nstructure of CTLGNet, which comprises two key modules: the \nLLFs extraction module based on the convolutional \narchitecture and the LGFs extraction module based on the \nimproved Transformer architecture.  \n1) LLFs extraction module: Given the strong local \nperception of convolution, we designed a LLFs extraction \nmodule which consists of three blocks to effectively extract \nLLFs. Each of the first two blocks is composed of convolution \nlayers with a kernel size of 3×3, a BN layer and a ReLU \nactivation function. The first of these convolutional layers is \nused to capture the low-level LLFs, while the second one \nfurther extracts the more abstract LLFs. The BN and \nactivation function layers play crucial roles in normalizing the \ndata and introducing non-linearities, respectively. The final \nblock in the structure incorporates a convolutional layer with a \n3×3 kernel size, a ReLU activation function, and a max \npooling layer, facilitating the extraction of higher-level LLFs. \nThe LLFs extraction module in our proposed model imparts \nsufficient inductive bias, enabling it to adeptly extract LLFs \nassociated with landslide areas of varying sizes. Suppose we \nhave an image input represented by 𝑋∈𝑅ு×ௐ×஼: \n𝑋௣ =𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑃𝑜𝑜𝑙(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑣(𝑋))))            (3) \n𝑋 will become the 1D sequence 𝑋௣ ∈𝑅ଵ×൫௉మ⋅஼൯, where 𝑝 \nrepresents the resolution of each image patch block. This \nmodule empowers the model to effectively retain a broader \nspectrum of high-dimensional and critical LLFs. \n2) LGFs extraction module: After patch and position \nembedding operations, the LGFs extraction module extracts \nthe LGFs through improved Transformer. Firstly, each \nTransformer encoder consists of traditional components, \nincluding multi-head self-attention (MSA), layer \nnormalization (LN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and skip \nconnections. \nThe MLP comprises a fully connected layer with GELU \nactivation function. When the encoder input is 𝑋௅: \n𝑋௅ାଵ′ =𝑀𝐿𝑃൫𝐿𝑁(𝑋௅)൯+𝑋௅                      (4) \n𝑋௅ାଵ=𝑀𝑆𝐴൫𝐿𝑁(𝑋௅ାଵ′ )൯+𝑋௅ାଵ′                   (5) \nWhere 𝐿 represents the number of Transformer encoder. In \nmodels like ViT and BERT, the class token plays a crucial \nrole in image classification [23], [42] as a specialized \nembedding vector. In CTLGNet, we introduce a replacement \nfor class tokens called Sequence Pooling (SeqPool), ensuring \nthat the output sequence encompasses relevant information \nfrom various regions of the input image [43]. By preserving \nthis information, the model becomes more adept at leveraging \nspatially sparse data, ultimately resulting in enhanced LSM \nperformance. SeqPool serves as an attention-based approach \nthat enables the network to appropriately balance the \nsequential embeddings within the potential space generated by \nthe Transformer encoder. If we get the output 𝑋௘ ∈𝑅஻×ே×஽ of \nthe last Transformer encoder, seqpool implements 𝑅஻×ே×஽ ↦\n𝑅஻×஽ through a series of transformations. The details are as \nfollows: \n𝑥௅′ =𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(Linear(𝑥௅)்)                    (6) \n𝑧=𝑥௅′ 𝑥௅ =𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥(Linear(𝑥௅)்)×𝑥௅        (7) \nIn the equation, 𝑋௘ represents the output of the last encoder, \n𝐵 is the batch size, 𝑁 is the sequence length, 𝐷 represents the \ntotal embedding dimension and 𝑧 is the output. \nThe model’s output layer features a fully connected layer, \nincorporating a Softmax activation function. This fully \nconnected layer is responsible for generating landslide \nsusceptibility values, providing a probabilistic of landslide \noccurrence. The proposed CTLGNet combines the strengths of \nCNN and Transformer architectures, offering an effective \nsolution for extracting both LLFs and LGFs in LSM tasks. \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

Model evaluation metrics \nEvaluation metrics play a crucial role in quantitatively \nvalidating and assessing the predictive capability of a model. \nThis study incorporates a range of model evaluation metrics to \nthoroughly evaluate the performance of the model. These \nmetrics include Overall Accuracy (OA), Precision Rate \n(Precision), Recall Rate (Recall), F1-score, Matthews \nCorrelation Coefficient (MCC), Kappa Coefficient (Kappa), \nRoot Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error \n(MAE), Area Under the Curve (AUC) and Receiver Operating \nCharacteristic (ROC). The specific formulas for calculating \nthese metrics are as follows: \n𝑂𝐴= ்௉ା்ே\n்௉ାி௉ା்ேାி                             (8) \n𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛= ்௉\n்௉ାி                             (9) \n𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙= ்௉\n்௉ାி                               (10) \n𝐹1 −𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒=ଶ×௉௥௘௖௜௦௜௢௡×ோ௘௖௔௟௟\n௉௥௘௖௜௦௜௢௡ାோ                   (11) \n𝑀𝐶𝐶= ்௉×்ேିி௉×ிே\nඥ(்௉ା )(்௉ାிே)(்ேାி௉)(்ேାி)             (12) \n𝐾𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑎=௣బି௣೐\nଵି௣೐\n                                   (13) \n𝑝௘ =(TPାFN)(TPାFP)ା(FPାTN)(FNାTN)\n௡మ                  (14) \nAmong these, TP (True Positive) refers to the number of \npixels correctly classified as landslides, TN (True Negative) \nrepresents the number of pixels correctly classified as non-\nlandslides, FP (False Positive) denotes the number of pixels \nincorrectly classified as landslides, and FN (False Negative) \nindicates the number of pixels incorrectly classified as non-\nlandslides. The closer the value of the above metrics is to 1, \nthe better the model performance is. RMSE and MAE are \nemployed to quantify the deviation between the predicted \nlandslide susceptibility values by the model and the actual \nvalues, thereby assessing the accuracy and reliability of the \nmodel. The calculation formulas for both are as follows: \n𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸=ටଵ\n௡∑ ( 𝑟௜ −𝑝௜)ଶ௡௜ୀଵ                        (15) \n𝑀𝐴𝐸=ଵ\n௡∑ | 𝑟௜ −𝑝௜|௡௜ୀଵ                            (16) \nIn the formula, 𝑛 represents the total number of pixels in the \ntest set, while 𝑟௜ and 𝑝௜ respectively denote the real data and \npredicted data. Additionally, the smaller the values of RMSE \nand MAE, the more accurate the model is. In addition, the \nROC curve, which illustrates the trade-off between sensitivity \nand specificity, is a crucial metric for assessing the reliability \nof classification models. The closer the ROC curve is to the \nupper-left corner, the more dependable the results are \nconsidered to be. \nLandslide density (LD) serves as a quantitative measure \nof landslide distribution within the LSM results. The \nclassification of landslide susceptibility results encompasses \nfive distinct categories: very low (VL), low (L), moderate (M), \nhigh (H), and very high (VH). LD is defined as the ratio of the \nproportion of landslide area to the proportion of zone area \nwithin the susceptibility zones [19], [44]. The formula for \ncalculating the LD value is as follows: \n𝐿𝐷=𝑃𝐿 / 𝑃𝐶                                   (17) \nIn the given equation, PC represents the proportion of each \nsusceptibility zone’s area relative to the entire site, while PL \nrepresents the proportion of landslide area within each \nsusceptibility zone relative to the total landslide area of the \nentire site. As the landslide susceptibility class increases, the \nLD value is expected to increase from very low to very high. \nThis relationship indicates a higher concentration of landslides \nin zones with higher susceptibility class [45]. \nH. Experimental environment and hyperparameter settings \nTable II provides an overview of the computer hardware \nutilized in the experiments conducted for this study. The \nsoftware, developed within the Python 3.8 environment, was \nbuilt on the PyCharm 2021 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2021 \nsoftware platforms. The experiments were carried out on the \nLinux-Ubuntu 18.04.05 LTS operating system. The DL \nnetwork was crafted using the Keras 2.4.3 artificial \nintelligence development framework. \nTABLE II \nCOMPUTER HARDWARE INFORMATION \nItem Detailed Parameter \nCPU Intel Xeon(R) Silver 4210R CPU@2.4GHZ×40 \nGPU GeForce RTX 3090/PCle/SSE2 \nMemory 128GB \nHard disk 8TB \nThe model accuracy and computational efficiency of the \nmodel depend not only on the structural design of the model, \nbut also on the hyperparameter settings in the model [41]. We \nused trial-and-error method to optimize all model parameters \nby limiting the range of hyperparameters, and finally selected \nthe optimal combination of parameters according to the model \naccuracy. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer \nwas selected for the network, initializing the learning rate at \n0.001, and employing a batch size of 16 for each learning \niteration. The final output layer of all models was set as the \nfully connected layer with the activation function \"Softmax\", \nwhich maps the output of multiple neurons in the upper layer \nto a value of 0-1, i.e., the probability of landslide occurrence. \nTo complement the Softmax activation, we chose the cross-\nentropy loss function with label smoothing as the loss function \nfor all models. The training process involved 100 epochs, and \nthe accuracy on the validation set was continuously monitored \nduring training to identify and select the best-performing \nmodel. \nIV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS \nA. Analysis of the LCFs  \nThe results of the multicollinearity analysis of LCFs in Site \nA and Site B are presented in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the \nLCFs in Site A and Site B have low multicollinearity. In Site \nA, all LCFs have VIF values below 2, indicating a low level of \nmulticollinearity among the data. The highest VIF value is \nassociated with elevation, which is 1.933, corresponding to a \nTOL value of 0.517.

These findings indicate that CTLGNet possesses \nstronger predictive power compared to both CNN-based and \nTransformer-based models in accurately predicting landslide-\nprone areas. \nTABLE Ⅳ \nMODEL EVALUATION METRICS OF EACH MODEL IN SITE A AND SITE B \nSite Models OA Precision Recall F1-score MCC Kappa AUC RMSE MAE \nSite A \nCNN 92.500% 88.956% 96.743% 92.686% 0.853 0.850 0.9732 0.274 0.075 \nResNet 93.800% 90.362% 97.812% 93.939% 0.879 0.876 0.9783 0.249 0.062 \nDenseNet 92.625% 91.079% 98.727% 94.749% 0.896 0.893 0.9758 0.232 0.054 \nViT 94.050% 91.614% 96.743% 94.108% 0.882 0.881 0.9791 0.244 0.060 \nFrIT 94.700% 91.481% 98.371% 94.801% 0.894 0.896 0.9787 0.230 0.053 \nCTLGNet 95.450% 93.552% 97.456% 95.464% 0.910 0.909 0.9817 0.213 0.045 \nSite B \nCNN 90.550% 88.213% 93.597% 90.825% 0.812 0.811 0.9541 0.307 0.095 \nResNet 90.075% 86.376% 95.147% 90.549% 0.806 0.802 0.9567 0.315 0.099 \nDenseNet 90.850% 88.387% 94.047% 91.129% 0.819 0.817 0.9501 0.303 0.092 \nViT 92.050% 90.196% 94.347% 92.225% 0.842 0.841 0.9605 0.282 0.080 \nFrIT 92.225% 88.858% 96.548% 92.543% 0.844 0.847 0.9635 0.278 0.078 \nCTLGNet 93.475% 91.136% 96.623% 93.799% 0.871 0.869 0.9693 0.255 0.065 \nC. Comparative evaluation of model performance \nIn this study, the dataset was partitioned into three subsets: \ntraining, validation, and test sets. The performance and \npredictive ability of six models were thoroughly evaluated \nusing the test set. The ROC curves and corresponding AUC \nvalues of these six models were generated and presented in \nFig. 9 for both Site A and Site B. In terms of AUC values, \nCTLGNet demonstrated exceptional performance among all \nthe models, surpassing the others in terms of AUC values for \nboth Site A (AUC=0.9817) and Site B (AUC=0.9693). These \noutstanding results indicate that CTLGNet exhibits superior \npredictive capabilities, making it the most promising model \nfor LSM task. \nTable Ⅳ presents a comprehensive comparison of model \nevaluation metrics for the six models in both Site A and Site B, \nwhere bold indicates the best. Notably, the proposed \nCTLGNet in this study exhibited the highest accuracy across \nmost evaluation metrics, underscoring its effectiveness. In Site \nA, CTLGNet achieved an impressive OA of 95.450%, \nPrecision of 93.552%, F1-score of 95.464%, MCC of 0.910, \nKappa of 0.909, RMSE of 0.213 and MAE of 0.045. It only \nhad a slightly lower Recall (97.456%) compared to ResNet \nDenseNet and FrIT.

DISCUSSION \nA. Comparison of the ability of the model to extract LGFs and \nLLFs \nIf the model accurately extracts the spatial probability of \nlandslide occurrence, the resulting susceptibility values should \ncorrespond to historical landslides, with susceptibility values \nwithin landslide areas approaching 1. In order to test the \nability of the models in landslide localisation and detail \ncapture (i.e., LGFs and LLFs extraction), we extracted the \nsusceptibility values for historical landslide areas predicted by \nsix models and annotated the distribution and median line of \nsusceptibility values (as depicted in the Fig. 10). In the violin \nplot, wider violins indicate a denser distribution of pixels \nwithin that range, while longer protrusions suggest the \npresence of more outliers in the landslide susceptibility results. \nThe region between the 25% and 75% represents the middle \n50% range of the dataset, representing the median \nconcentration trend of the data.  \nIn Site A, it is evident that CTLGNet outperforms all other \nmodels by achieving the highest mean susceptibility value \namong the historical landslide areas, measuring an impressive \n0.876. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional performance in \nterms of having the lowest Standard Deviation (SD) and Mean \nAbsolute Deviation (MAD) compared to the other models. \nThe median line and the 25%-75% percentile range of \nCTLGNet also surpass those of the other four models, further \nindicating its superior predictive capability. Moving on to Site \nB, CTLGNet still delivers a competitive performance with an \naverage susceptibility value of 0.842, slightly lower than \nDenseNet’s score of 0.857. Nevertheless, it maintains its \nreputation for reliability with the lowest SD and the lowest \nMAD in this context. When considering the combination of \nmean, SD, and MAD values of the susceptibility \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

The comparison results are shown in Fig. 11. \nBenefiting from LGFs and LLFs extracted by the model, \nCTLGNet can be very good for landslide localization and \ndetail capture, and more accurately predict the location of \nlandslide occurrence.

Comparison of model efficiency and computation \nIn order to further validate the performance of the proposed \nmodel, this study conducts a comparison focusing on model \nefficiency and computation. Given the inherent advantage of \nconvolution-based models in this aspect, our analysis is \nlimited to a comparison with Transformer-based models. \nSpecifically, we computed the number of model parameters \nand the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) for CTLGNet and \ncompared them against two Transformer-based models \nutilized in this study (ViT and FriT), as well as an efficient \nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing.

FLOPs can be \ninterpreted as the amount of computation of the model, which \nis commonly used to measure the complexity of the model. \nMobileViT integrates the strengths of both CNN and ViT, \nemerging as a lightweight and general model that has \ndemonstrated superior performance over CNN and ViT based \nnetworks across various tasks and datasets. The number of \nparameters and FLOPs for each model are summarized in \nTable Ⅴ. \nTABLE Ⅴ \nCOMPARISON OF MODEL PARAMETERS AND FLOPS \nModels Parameters  FLOPs \nViT 11,207,426  11,193,973 \nFrIT 10,676,482  10,669,653 \nMobileViT 1,307,621  72,661,289 \nCTLGNet 950,979  1,894,933 \nThe analysis reveals that CTLGNet exhibits the lowest \nnumber of parameters and FLOPs among the compared \nmodels, highlighting its computational efficiency. Conversely, \nboth ViT and FrIT exhibit higher parameter counts and FLOPs, \nconsistent with their structural characteristics. While \nMobileViT has only a higher number of parameters than \nCTLGNet but the highest FLOPs, a trend consistent with the \nfindings reported in the original article. \nC. The robustness analysis of the CTLGNet \nTo further test the robustness of the proposed model, we \nperformed a five-fold cross-validation of the CTLGNet. First, \nthe constructed landslide dataset was randomly and evenly \ndivided into five parts. Then, based on the training, validation \nand test dataset ratio of 3:1:1 set in this study, one of the parts \nis taken as the test dataset each time without repetition, and \nthe CTLGNet is trained with the other four parts as the \ntraining and validation datasets. Finally, the AUC value of the \nmodel on the test set is calculated, providing a comprehensive \nmeasure of the accuracy of LSM results. \nTABLE Ⅵ \nTHE AUC VALUES FOR THE FIVE-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATION OF \nTHE CTLGNET MODEL \n ① ② ③ ④ ⑤ Mean \nSite A 0.9817 0.9812 0.9811 0.9815 0.9815 0.9814 \nSite B 0.9693 0.9689 0.9690 0.9688 0.9692 0.9690 \nThe AUC values obtained from the five-fold cross-\nvalidation of CTLGNet, as presented in Table VI, exhibit \nminor fluctuations within narrow ranges. Specifically, the \nAUC values range from 0.9811 to 0.9817 for Site A and from \n0.9688 to 0.9693 for Site B. Calculating the mean AUC values \nacross the five experiments yields 0.9814 for Site A and \n0.9690 for Site B. These values outperform those of the \ncomparison models, affirming the robustness and stability of \nCTLGNet. \nD. Limitations and future work \nFirst and foremost, the accuracy and credibility of LSM \nheavily depend on the quality of data sources. Given the rapid \nprogress in remote sensing imaging sensors, multi-modal \nremote sensing data can offer complementary information [50]. \nEffectively enhancing data quality and establishing a high-\nquality landslide dataset by integrating multi-modal data \npresent a significant challenge.  \nFurthermore, the training samples are the basis of \nconstructing the LSM model. While this study applied \nfundamental data augmentation techniques, such as flipping \nand rotation, to augment the multi-level features of landslides, \nmore advanced data augmentation methods have already \ndemonstrated success in image classification tasks [51], [52]. \nInvestigating whether these sophisticated data augmentation \nstrategies are effective in highlighting landslides features to \nimprove the accuracy of LSM models is a worthy goal. \nLast but not least, the performance of LSM is notably \ninfluenced by the chosen model architecture [48]. Model \nconstruction using different DL models may result in \nvariations in the extraction and effectiveness of landslide \nfeatures. While this research employed a sequential structure \nto integrate the CNN and Transformer, investigating the \npotential of utilizing parallel or hierarchical structures to build \nLSM models represents a direction for our future endeavors.  \nⅥ. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we propose a CNN-Transformer hybrid model \n(CTLGNet) that takes into account both LLFs and LGFs for \nLSM. The model is applied in two regions: Three Gorges \nReservoir Area and Jiuzhaigou. Historical landslide inventory \nand nine LCFs were selected to construct a landslide dataset \nfor LSM. Subsequently, we employ comprehensive evaluation \nmetrics to evaluate the LSM results obtained by our proposed \nmodel and compared with five other models: CNN, ResNet, \nDenseNet, ViT, and FrIT. \nThe experimental results demonstrate that CTLGNet \nutilized in this study achieve relatively accurate LSM results \nand the regions identified as VH and H susceptibility classes \nmost closely match the spatial distribution of historical \nlandslides. Statistical results show that CTLGNet outperforms \nthe other five models in all evaluation metrics except Recall, \nwith AUC values of 0.9817 and 0.9693 for the two regions \nrespectively. Furthermore, the extraction of landslide \nsusceptibility values within historical landslide areas \ndemonstrates that CTLGNet produces results with the highest \nmean value and the lowest MAD and SD. This indicates that \nthe CTLGNet captured the best localization and details of \nlandslides and extracted LLFs and LGFs most adequately. \nBesides that, CTLGNet has the lowest number of parameters \nand FLOPs among the models related to Transformer, which \ngives it an advantage in terms of model computations. In \nconclusion, our proposed method demonstrates outstanding \ncapabilities in predicting landslides and exhibits excellent \ngeneralization ability. As a result, it holds promising potential \nfor a wide range of LSM applications. \nREFERENCES \n[1] M. J. Froude and D. N. Petley, “Global fatal landslide occurrence from \n2004 to 2016,” Nat.
