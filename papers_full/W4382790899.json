  "abstract": "The availability of solar irradiance time series without missing data is an ideal scenario for researchers in the field. However, it is not achievable for a variety of reasons, such as measurement errors, sampling gaps, or other factors. Time series imputation methods can be a solution to the lack of data and, in this paper, we study the applicability of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) as an irradiance time series imputation solution. In this regard, a BERT model was trained from scratch for the masked language modelling (MLM) task, and the quality of the imputation was evaluated according to the number of missing values and the position within the series. The experiments were conducted over a dataset of 165 stations, captured by meteorological stations distributed over the Spanish regions of Galicia, Castile, and Le&amp;oacute;n. In the evaluation process, an average coefficient of determination (R2 score) of 0.89% was obtained, the maximum result being 0.95%.",
