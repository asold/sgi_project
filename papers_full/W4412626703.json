With the recent advancements in generative\nAI, particularly in natural language processing, AI-driven decision support\nsystems may offer potential beneﬁts in streamlining case discussions and\nreducing variability in clinical decision-making4,5.\nPrevious research has explored AI applications in oncology, particu-\nlarly in radiology and pathology6,7; however, its role in clinical decision\nsupport remains underexplored. This study evaluates the capability of an\nadvanced large language model (LLM) AI chatbot to provide RCC treat-\nment recommendations in alignment with MDT decisions, intending to\nassess its potential utility in enhancing oncological workﬂow efﬁciency.\nMethods\nAll RCC cases discussed by the institutional MDT were reviewed. For each\ncase, a summarized clinical history— including age, sex, relevant imaging\nﬁndings, tumor stage, and eventual treatment and/or diagnostic procedures\n(i.e., biopsy) received with histology— was input into the AI chatbot after\nremoving all identifying patient data.\nAll interactions were conducted using the“GPT for Slides™ Docs™\nSheets™” add-on, conﬁgured with the OpenAI GPT-4.1 model (release o1,\ndated 2024-05-12) with a Temperature 0.30, Top-p 1.0, and 120k token\ncontext window.

The medical\nteam summarized each case in a concise text (30–50 words) following a\nstandardized format. These summaries were entered into theﬁrst Column\nof a Google Sheets worksheet. To generate automated therapeutic and\ndiagnostic suggestions based on the2024 European Association of Urology\n(EAU) guidelines\n3, a custom function was implemented in Google Sheets:\nfx = GPT (“Can you help us suggest the pathway according to the 2024\nEAU guidelines for the following patients? Please give us only theﬁrst choice of\nthe next step you would recommend based on the clinical scenario and the\npatient’s age. You must use a maximum of 30 words”). All relevant clinical\nfactors— such as disease stage, prior treatments, comorbidities, and imaging\nﬁndings— were incorporated within the free-text clinical summary provided\nto the LLM.\nThis function allowed the patient summaries from theﬁrst column to\nbe processed automatically, generating a response from ChatGPT within\nseconds.\nThe generated outputs were compared to the ofﬁcial MDT recom-\nmendations, and concordance rates were analyzed after revision by a third\nparty (A.A).\nStatistical analysis\nTo compare the output of the human MDT with that of the AI chatbot in\nsuggesting the diagnostic and/or therapeutic pathway for a series of patients,\nthe following statistical methods were used: the Cohen’sK a p p a(κ)m e a -\nsured the level of agreement between the AI and MDT while adjusting for\nchance agreement, stratiﬁed by the clinical stage of the disease; the Fisher’s\nexact test was applied after categorizing the AI and MDT recommendations\ninto different decision-making settings to assess whether a signiﬁcant dif-\nference existed in the distribution of suggestions. Multivariable logistic\nregression analysis was performed to identify factors predicting a greater\ndiscrepancy between AI and MDT recommendations.\nA total of 103 RCC cases were included. The patients’demographics\nand clinical characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The\nanalysis of agreement between the AI chatbot and the MDT in suggesting\nthe next diagnostic and/or therapeutic pathway showed an overall agree-\nment of 62.1%, with an expected agreement of 32.6%, resulting in a Cohen’s\nKappa (κ)o f0 . 4 4(p < 0.001), indicating moderate agreement.\nStratifying by disease stage, agreement was highest in the Nx/N0 M0\ngroup (73.8% observed vs. 48.9% expected,κ = 0.48,p <0 . 0 0 1 ) , r eﬂecting\nmoderate agreement. In the Nx/N0 M+ subgroup, agreement was 60%\nobserved vs. 28.9% expected,κ = 0.44,p = 0.001, also suggesting moderate\nagreement. Conversely, a lower agreement was observed in patients with\nN +M0 disease (45.4% observed vs. 28.1% expected,κ = 0.24,p = 0.03). It\nw a sp a r t i c u l a r l yw e a ki nt h eN+M+ subgroup (31.2% observed vs. 22.3%\nexpected, κ =0 . 1 1 ,p = 0.09), where no signiﬁcant agreement was detected\n(data detailed in Table1).\nSigniﬁcant differences were found in the categories of recommenda-\ntions into different decision-making settings between the AI chatbot and the\nMDT (p = 0.001).\nHigher discordance was found in cases where a biopsy was suggested.\nLower discordance was noted in the cases where follow-up imaging was\nindicated (Table2).\nThe multivariable analysis identiﬁed several factors inﬂuencing the\nconcordance between the multidisciplinary team and the AI chatbot:\nongoing systemic therapy showed a potential association with higher con-\ncordance, with an OR of 4.54 (95% CI: 0.82–25.05,p =0 . 0 8 ) .H o w e v e r ,i td i d\nnot reach statistical signiﬁcance. Disease status had a notable impact on\nconcordance: compared to patients with Nx/N0 M0 disease (reference\ncategory), those with both nodal and metastatic involvement (N+M +)\nhad signiﬁcantly lower odds of concordance (OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.03–0.5,\np = 0.004). Conversely, patients with nodal involvement but no metastases\n(N +M0) showed a signal toward reduced concordance (OR = 0.26, 95%\nCI: 0.06–1.11, p = 0.07), though this did not reach statistical signiﬁcance\n(Table 3).\nOur study demonstrates that AI-driven decision support systems have\nthe potential to align with expert MDT decision-making in a proportion of\nRCC cases. The AI and MDT agreements varied across disease stages, with\nweaker agreements in more advanced disease settings. Disagreement was\nmore common in cases where invasive diagnostic and therapeutic proce-\ndures were recommended instead of simple follow-up with imaging.\nPrevious researchers have recently published pilot experiences analo-\ngous to ours but in otherﬁelds.

Recommendations of the LLM were\nretrospectively compared to the decisions by the MDT: in seven out of ten\ncases, LLM recommendations overlapped those by the MDT. The authors\nunderlined that the LLM tended to overlook important patient\ninformation\n10. These results are very similar to what we observed in our\nexperience. It is entirely understandable that discrepancies may arise\nbetween the verdicts from a LLM and those by an MDT. These discrepancies\nmay stem from unique clinical presentations that are not sufﬁciently\naddressed by the guidelines, or from the fact that the LLM lacks full\nawareness of the patient’s frailty status and cannot view and interpret\nradiological imaging, for example. This is why managing atypical cases\npresents the greatest room for improvement when aiming at integrating the\nworkﬂow of an MDT with AI.\nIn colorectal cancerﬁeld, Choo et al. discussed colorectal cancer cases\nin the MDT board at a single tertiary institution. The treatment recom-\nmendations made by the LLM ChatGPT were analyzed to ensure adherence\nto oncological principles. The recommendations by LLM were compared\nwith the decision plans made by theMDT. As a result, the oncological\nmanagement recommendation concordance rate between the LLM and the\nMDT was 86.7%, which is very optimistic compared to what observed in our\nexperience\n11.\nLechien et al. evaluated ChatGPT-4 performance in oncological board\ndecisions regarding 20 medical records of patients with head and neck\ncancer. GPT-4 was accurate in 13 cases (65%)\n12.\nIn anotherﬁeld, Haemmerly et al. prompted ChatGPT with detailed\npatient histories to recommend treatments. Like the other reported\nexperiences, the output by the LLM was evaluated by a rater, and inter-rater\nagreement was assessed. The performance of the LLM was poor at classi-\nfying glioma types, but good for recommending adjuvant treatments.\nOverall, expert agreement was moderate, as indicated by an intraclass\ncorrelation coefﬁcient of 0.7\n13.\nIt is clear, early experiences with testing LLMs in multidisciplinary\ndecision-making for oncology patients are beginning to emerge. With some\nexceptions, such studies consistently report similarﬁndings, with agreement\nrates around 60-70%. As expected, the ability of a LLM to replicate the\nverdict of a MDT varies depending oncase complexity, with higher con-\ncordance observed in less intricate cases.\nT oo u rk n o w l e d g e ,o u r si st h eﬁrst study to assess a generative AI\nmodel’s ability to propose guideline-based MDT recommendations in the\nﬁeld of kidney cancer. However, we are still far from the day when an LLM\ncould fully replace a human MDT. Machine learning algorithms trained\nwith big data about decisions made by MDT teams could progressively\nimprove the accuracy of AI.\nWhile the study presents an original and timely concept, it is accom-\npanied by several limitations and controversial aspects that should be\ncarefully considered when interpreting the results.\nAs concerning methodologyﬂaws, the study focused on a single,\nwidely used LLM, and did not include a comparative evaluation across\ndifferent generative models. While this choice was intentional for a\npilot feasibility analysis, it limits the generalizability of ourﬁndings\nacross the broader and rapidly evolving landscape of LLMs. Comparing\ndifferent models or even the same model with varying hyperparameters\nwould require careful consideration of factors such as prompt design,\ntemperature, and random seed s, which can introduce signi ﬁcant\nvariability in performance. Another limitation is the non-systematic\napproach to prompt design: the prompt was written in a straightfor-\nward and practical manner without formal testing or comparison\nagainst alternative formulations. Prompt engineering strategies— such\nas testing variants, iterative reﬁnement, or formal validation— would be\nrecommended. While case summa ries provided to the LLM were\ngenerated using a standardized format, their internal consistency was\nnot formally assessed; subtle variability in how clinical scenarios were\nframed may have inﬂuenced downstream comparisons — much like\ndifferent angles can alter the perception of the same object. Future\nstudies should consider quantifying this representational variability\nusing methods such as cosine similarity\n14 or Jaccard index15, especially\nin settings where LLM outputs are highly sensitive to input phrasing.\nWhen evaluating LLM outputs and MDT decisions, textual similarity\nanalyses using BLEU\n16,R O U G E17, and cosine metrics14 (Supplementary\nMaterial, Supplementary Discussion 1) revealed limited lexical and\nstructural overlap, highlighting the need for reﬁned prompting and\nmore semantically-aware evaluation methods; however, the reader\nshould note that low scores do not necessarily indicate clinical inac-\ncuracy and warrant qualitative case-by-case assessment, as was done in\nthis study.\nRegarding theﬂaws in data evaluated, the study focused exclusively on\nﬁrst-time MDT discussions to ensure unbiased comparisons, thereby\nexcluding follow-up cases where decisions are often guided by prior ther-\napeutic steps; while this enhances internal validity, it limits insights into\nscenarios where LLMs might eventually offer greater workﬂow support. In\nfact, it may be precisely the more straightforward setting of re-discussions—\nwhere clinical pathways are already partially deﬁned— that represents the\nmost immediate opportunity for meaningful LLM integration into MDT\nworkﬂows. A major limitation is the lack of granular data on performance\nstatus, the absence of a systematic frailty assessment using geriatric scores,\nand the lack of standardized evaluation of comorbidities, which could have\nprovided a more detailed and personalized inﬂuence on the decision-\nmaking process. These factors were included in the clinical case scenario\nonly when considered essential for the LLM to make an informed decision.\nAdditionally, the lack of direct integration of imaging or pathology data into\nthe LLM workﬂow represents another drawback. Unlike human MDTs,\nwhich routinely base their decisions ondirect visual inspection of radiologic\nand histologic images, the LLM relied solely on textual inputs. This intro-\nduces an asymmetry in the comparison, as critical diagnostic nuances may\nnot be fully captured in narrative reports. That said, incorporating raw\nimage data into general-purpose LLMs raises substantial ethical and\ncybersecurity concerns, including risks related to patient privacy and data\nprotection, which currently preclude such integration in routine clinical\nresearch settings.\nA further limitation lies in the absence of systematic follow-up data,\nwhich prevents a direct evaluation ofthe clinical impact of both MDT and\nAI-driven decisions. In fact, the real-world effectiveness of MDT recom-\nmendations is itself not always measurable, making any outcome-based\ncomparison with AI inherently challenging and beyond the scope of\nthis study.\nFinally, the study lacks external validation, as all cases were drawn from\na single institution. This limits the generalizability of ourﬁndings. Future\nresearch will focus onﬁne-tuning the model and conducting external\nvalidations to enhance applicability across broader settings.\nWith all these limitations in mind, inthe context of optimizing patient\ncare, our pilot experience suggests that LLMs could at least serve as a triage\ntool, helping to prioritize the most critical cases before discussion.\nA continuous, exponential increase in the number of cases\nrequiring discussion is expected in the next years, in alignment with\nmodern clinical practices. Consider, for example, localized kidney\ncancer: many patients who, in the past, would have been treated exclu-\nsively with surgery— such as partial or radical nephrectomy— have now\nto be at least evaluated for counseling for adjuvant immunotherapy\n18.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nAs for legal and regulatory considerations, we acknowledge that we are\nstill far from a point where AI could ethically or legally replace human\ndecision-making in high-stakes clinical contexts such as MDT discussions.\nWe remark that this study should be interpreted as a pilot exploration of AI’s\nsupportive potential, not as an endorsement of autonomous, AI-driven care.\nIn conclusion, LLMs show promise as a support tool for RCC decision-\nmaking within an MDT framework, particularly for cases with lower\ncomplexity. While AI may not replace human expertise, it has the potential\nto optimize case discussions and improve workﬂow efﬁciency. Further\nvalidation studies and AI model enhancements will be essential to maximize\nits utility in real-world oncology settings.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41698-025-01014-4 Brief communication\nnpj Precision Oncology|           (2025) 9:257 3\nData availability\nThe dataset generated and analyzed during the current study is not publicly\navailable due to [property of AOUI Verona] but is available from the cor-\nresponding author upon reasonable request.\nCode availability\nTrivial statistical codes were used fort h ea n a l y s i si nt h i sm a n u s c r i p tb u ta r e\navailable upon request from the corresponding author.\nReceived: 20 March 2025; Accepted: 16 June 2025;\nReferences\n1.
