Stratton*, Annemarie Hackston, David Longmore, Rod Dixon, Sarah Price, Mike Stroud,\nClaire King and Marinos Elia\nInstitute of Human Nutrition, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK\n(Received 2 February 2004 – Revised 7 June 2004 – Accepted 13 July 2004)\nThe ‘malnutrition universal screening tool’ (‘MUST’) for adults has been developed for all health care settings and patient groups, but ease\nof use and agreement with other published tools when screening to identify malnutrition requires investigation. The present study assessed\nthe agreement and the prevalence of malnutrition risk between ‘MUST’ and a variety of other tools in the same patients and compared the\nease of using these tools. Groups of patients were consecutively screened using ‘MUST’ and: (1) MEREC Bulletin (MEREC) and Hickson\nand Hill (HH) tools (ﬁfty gastroenterology outpatients); (2) nutrition risk score (NRS) and malnutrition screening tool (MST; seventy-ﬁve\nmedical inpatients); (3) short-form mini nutritional assessment (MNA-tool; eighty-six elderly and eighty-ﬁve surgical inpatients);\n(4) subjective global assessment (SGA; ﬁfty medical inpatients); (5) Doyle undernutrition risk score (URS; ﬁfty-two surgical inpatients).\nUsing ‘MUST’, the prevalence of malnutrition risk ranged from 19–60 % in inpatients and 30 % in outpatients. ‘MUST’ had ‘excellent’\nagreement (k 0·775–0·893) with MEREC, NRS and SGA tools, ‘fair–good’ agreement ( k 0·551–0·711) with HH, MST and MNA-tool\ntools and ‘poor’ agreement with the URS tool (k 0·255). When categorisation of malnutrition risk differed between tools, it did not do so\nsystematically, except between ‘MUST’ and MNA-tool ( P¼0·0005) and URS ( P¼0·039). ‘MUST’ and MST were the easiest, quickest\ntools to complete (3–5 min). The present investigation suggested a high prevalence of malnutrition in hospital inpatients and outpatients\n(19–60 % with ‘MUST’) and ‘fair–good’ to ‘excellent’ agreement beyond chance between ‘MUST’ and most other tools studied. ‘MUST’\nwas quick and easy to use in these patient groups.\nMalnutrition: Screening: Validity: Adults\nMalnutrition can be deﬁned as: ‘a state of nutrition in\nwhich a deﬁciency, excess or imbalance of energy, protein,\nand other nutrients causes measurable adverse effects on\ntissue/body form (body shape, size, composition) and func-\ntion and clinical outcome’ (Elia, 2003; Stratton et al.\n2003b). Routine screening of patients to identify risk of\nmalnutrition has been recommended by many national,\ninternational and specialist organisations (British Dietetic\nAssociation, 1999; Elia, 2000, 2003 (British Association\nfor Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition); Department of\nHealth, 2001; Council of Europe, 2002; Royal College of\nPhysicians, 2002; Kondrup et al. 2003 (European Society\nof Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition); NHS Quality\nImprovement Scotland, 2003). These recommendations\nhave been made for several reasons. First, malnutrition\nadversely affects physical and psychological function\n(Elia, 2000; Stratton et al. 2003b) and impairs patients’\nrecovery from disease and injury, thereby increasing mor-\nbidity and mortality. Such detrimental effects are costly to\nsociety, increasing health care utilisation (Stratton et al.\n2002). Second, despite being a common problem (Stratton\n& Elia, 2000; Stratton et al. 2003b), malnutrition is fre-\nquently unrecognised and untreated in many health care\nsettings, including nursing and other care homes, general\npractice, and hospital outpatients and inpatients (Consu-\nmer’s Association, 1996, 1999; Elia, 2000). Implementing\nroutine screening to detect malnutrition has been hindered\nby the lack of universally agreed criteria to identify it. Con-\nsequently, there are a variety of nutritional tools in use that\nincorporate different anthropometric, biochemical and\nclinical criteria which have often been developed for use\nin a particular setting or for a speciﬁc patient group\n†Some of the results have been presented as abstracts at meetings of the British Association for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (BAPEN) and the Euro pean\nSociety of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN).

The use of such varied criteria\nmeans that different tools may identify different types\nand proportions of individuals as being at risk of malnu-\ntrition. This can be confusing and might effect decisions\nabout nutritional management. The use of a variety of\ndifferent tools also hinders comparisons of the prevalence\nof malnutrition across different settings and patient\ngroups. The ‘malnutrition universal screening tool’\n(‘MUST’) for adults has recently been developed for\nmulti-disciplinary use by the multi-disciplinary Malnu-\ntrition Advisory Group of the British Association for Par-\nenteral and Enteral Nutrition (www.bapen.org.uk). The\ntool is supported by the British Dietetic Association, the\nRoyal College of Nursing, the Registered Nursing Homes\nAssociation and the British Association for Parenteral\nand Enteral Nutrition. The NHS Quality Improvement\nScotland Clinical Standards for ‘Food, ﬂuid and nutritional\ncare in hospitals’, which have made nutritional screening\nmandatory in Scottish hospitals, consider ‘MUST’ to be\nappropriate for hospital use (and is the only tool mentioned\nby name; NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, 2003).\n‘MUST’ (Fig. 1) is a screening tool that has been devised\nfor application to all adult patients across all health care\nsettings (Table 1; Elia, 2003). In the absence of a deﬁnitive\nmethod to diagnose malnutrition, ‘MUST’ has been devel-\noped to detect protein–energy malnutrition and the risk of\ndeveloping malnutrition using evidence-based criteria\n(Elia, 2003). Three independent criteria are used. (1) Cur-\nrent weight status using BMI. The BMI cut-offs used are in\nline with recommendations made by a range of national\nand international organisations. (2) Unintentional weight\nloss, using cut-off points that reﬂect practical and approxi-\nmate boundaries between normal and abnormal intra-indi-\nvidual changes in weight and the likely presence of a\ntreatable underlying condition, which if undetected could\nproduce further weight loss and malnutrition. There is\nalso evidence that a weight loss of 5–10 % can produce\nphysiologically relevant changes in body function (Shetty\n& James, 1994; Elia, 2003). (3) Acute disease effect produ-\ncing or likely to produce no nutritional intake for\nFig. 1. The ‘malnutrition universal screening tool’ (‘MUST’) for adults: record malnutrition risk category, presence of obesity and/or need for\nspecial diets and follow local policy; re-assess those identiﬁed at risk as they move through care settings. †Unless detrimental or no beneﬁt is\nexpected from nutritional support, e.g. imminent death. *In the obese, underlying acute conditions are generally controlled before treatment of\nobesity. If unable to obtain height and weight, alternative measurements and subjective criteria are provided (Elia, 2003). qBritish Association\nfor Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.\nR. J. Stratton et al.800\nhttps://doi.org/10.1079/BJN20041258\n Published online by Cambridge University Press\n.5 d. This allows for the effects of acute conditions (such\nas a stroke) that can cause there to be no dietary intake,\nresulting in rapid weight loss. Such a level of dietary\nrestriction in the presence and absence of disease has\nalso been shown to detrimentally affect body function.\nThe criteria used are in line with recommendations made\nby other expert bodies (e.g. ASPEN Board of Clinical\nDirectors, 1987). These three components can reﬂect the\n‘journey’ of the patient from the past (weight loss), to\nthe present (current BMI) and into the future (effect of dis-\nease). Each of the three components can independently pre-\ndict clinical outcome with the importance of individual\ncomponents varying with the clinical circumstances.\nTogether the three components are better predictors of\noutcome than the individual components (Elia, 2003).\nThere is also a large body of evidence detailing the physi-\ncal and psychological effects of malnutrition (for review,\nsee Stratton et al. 2003b). ‘MUST’ is linked to a generic\ncare plan for the treatment of patients at risk of malnu-\ntrition, which is modiﬁable according to local policy and\nthe resources available and is outlined in Fig. 1. To support\nthis, there are many reviews, including systematic reviews\nand meta-analyses that detail the evidence base for the\ntreatment of malnutrition (e.g. Potter et al. 1998; Akner\n& Cederholm, 2001; Lewis et al. 2001; Stratton et al.\n2003). For more information about the evidence base for\n‘MUST’, refer to Elia (2000, 2003).\nIn the absence of a ‘gold standard’ for malnutrition it is\ndifﬁcult to establish the validity of nutrition screening\ntools. However, ‘MUST’ has content validity (comprehen-\nsiveness of the tool), face validity (issues which are relevant\nto the purpose of the test) and internal consistency. ‘MUST’\nhas some predictive validity, e.g. predicting length of hospi-\ntal stay, mortality and discharge destination of groups of\nhospital patients (King et al. 2003; Wood et al. 2004) and\ngeneral practitioner visits and hospital admissions in free-\nliving individuals (Stratton et al. 2002). ‘MUST’ also has\nexcellent reproducibility ( k 0·809–1·000) between users\n(nurses, health care assistants, doctors, nursing and medical\nstudents) in different health care settings across the UK\n(Elia, 2003; Stratton et al. 2003a). However, the concurrent\nvalidity of this tool needs investigation. Concurrent (corre-\nlational) validity involves comparison of a tool with another\nvalidated criterion measure or reference measure. A tool can\nhave concurrent validity if it shows good to excellent agree-\nment with other tools or with a reference standard, (e.g.\nassessed by k, a chance-corrected measure of agreement).\n‘MUST’ has been shown to have excellent agreement with\na dietitian’s assessment of malnutrition (Elia, 2003), but\nwhether it has agreement with other previously published\ntools used in the UK in adults is unknown and requires\nstudy. Generally there is little information about the concur-\nrent validity of other tools and when this has been estab-\nlished, it has usually been through comparison of only a\nfew tools in one particular patient group and health care set-\nting (e.g. Correia et al. 2003). A comparison of the ease of\nuse of ‘MUST’ with other tools is also warranted. Therefore,\nthe aims of the present series of studies were: (1) to compare\nthe prevalence of malnutrition risk assessed by ‘MUST’ and\na variety of other published tools in both hospital outpatients\nand inpatients; (2) to investigate the concurrent validity of\n‘MUST’ with these other published tools and to assess\nwhether the same patients are identiﬁed as malnourished;\n(3) to compare the ease of use of ‘MUST’ with these\nother published tools.\nSubjects and methods\nEthical approval was obtained for all studies from the\nLocal Research Ethics Committee. Only patients able to\ngive informed consent were eligible for recruitment, and\nso those with conditions such as dementia, confusion and\nunconsciousness were excluded. Less than 5 % of patients\napproached refused to give informed consent. A series of\nﬁve separate investigations were undertaken, one in hospi-\ntal outpatients and four in hospital inpatients to assess the\nfollowing.\nPrevalence of malnutrition . ‘MUST’ was used to cat-\negorise hospital outpatients and inpatients into three mal-\nnutrition risk categories (low-, medium- or high-risk) and\ntwo risk categories (low-risk and combined medium-risk þ\nhigh-risk of malnutrition). The prevalence of malnutrition,\nusing seven other published nutritional tools, was also\nrecorded and compared with the results from ‘MUST’ in\nspeciﬁc patient groups speciﬁed later. The tools included\nwere selected because they were commonly used in the\nUK and were appropriate for the patient populations and\nsettings in which the studies were carried out. The seven\ntools chosen were: the MEREC Bulletin tool (MEREC)\n(National Prescribing Centre, 1998), the Hickson and Hill\ntool (HH; Hickson & Hill, 1997), the nutrition risk score\n(NRS; Reilly et al. 1995), the malnutrition screening tool\n(MST; Ferguson et al. 1999), the short-form mini nutri-\ntional assessment screening tool (MNA-tool; Nestle S.A.,\nSwitzerland; Rubenstein et al. 2001), the subjective\nglobal assessment (SGA; Detsky et al. 1987) and the\nundernutrition risk score (URS; Doyle et al. 2000).\nConcurrent validity of ‘malnutrition universal screening\ntool’ with other tools. The concurrent validity of ‘MUST’\nwith the seven published nutritional tools mentioned earlier\nwas investigated (MEREC, HH, NRS, MST, MNA-tool,\nSGA and URS). Agreement and chance-corrected agreement\nTable 1.

Disagreements in categorisations by pairs of tools\nwere examined for systematic under or over-categorisation\nof risk (for further details, see p. 803).\nEase of use and time taken to complete tools . The time\ntaken to complete each tool was recorded and the ease of\nuse on a four-point Likert scale (very easy, easy, difﬁcult,\nvery difﬁcult) noted.\nInvestigators and training\nBefore undertaking the studies, all investigators underwent\na series of training sessions (up to 7 h) provided by the\nsame three individuals (two dietetic research fellows, one\nphysician–professor) experienced in undertaking nutri-\ntional measurements and using screening tools. The ability\nof investigators to undertake measurements and screening\nappropriately was veriﬁed before data collection and at\nintervals during the studies. The investigators were from\na variety of disciplines (nursing, medicine, nutrition).\nAlthough it is recognised that nurses are most likely to\nundertake screening in some health care settings,\n‘MUST’ has been developed for multi-disciplinary use\nand in some settings may be used by doctors, dietitians\netc. In addition, previous studies have shown excellent\nagreement between raters of different disciplines when\nusing ‘MUST’ (Elia, 2003), although this information\ndoes not exist for all of the screening tools tested in this\nseries of studies.\n‘Malnutrition universal screening tool’ methodology\nIn all investigations, ‘MUST’ (Fig. 1) was completed as\nfollows. Height was measured to the nearest 1 mm using\na portable, free-standing stadiometer (Seca, Leicester,\nUK), according to standard methodology (Elia, 2003). If\nheight could not be measured accurately (e.g. patient\nunable to stand), recalled height (if reliable and realistic;\nElia, 2003; Stratton et al. 2003a) or knee height (Elia,\n2000, 2003) were used to calculate height. Weight was\nmeasured to the nearest 0·01 kg using ward or clinic-\nbased clinical scales, all of which were calibrated at the\nstart of the study. If weight could not be measured accu-\nrately, recalled weight (if reliable and realistic) was used\n(Elia, 2003; Stratton et al. 2003a). BMI (kg/m\n2) was calcu-\nlated and scored accordingly (Fig. 1). If neither weight nor\nheight could be obtained, subjective criteria assessing\nphysical appearance (very thin, thin etc.) were used, com-\nbined with a measurement of mid-upper arm circumference\n,235 mm to identify individuals with BMI ,20 kg/m\n2\n(Elia, 2003). The percentage unplanned weight loss in\nthe previous 3–6 months was calculated from documented\nweights in patients’ notes or from patients’ reports and\nscored accordingly (Fig. 1). Subjective criteria could be\nused if reliable records or reports could not be obtained.\nThese included the presence of loose ﬁtting clothes or jew-\nellery indicative of weight loss and psychological and/or\nphysical illnesses leading to weight loss. An acute disease\neffect (if there has been or is likely to be no nutritional\nintake for .5 d) was noted and scored (Fig. 1). For a\ndetailed explanation of the methods and evidence-base\nfor ‘MUST’, see Elia (2003).\nInvestigation of malnutrition in hospital outpatients\nComparison of the ‘malnutrition universal screening tool’\nwith the MEREC Bulletin tool and the Hickson and Hill\ntool in gastroenterology outpatients . Fifty consecutive\npatients (thirty-one female, nineteen male; mean age 56\n(\nSD 16) years; BMI 28·4 ( SD 10·1) kg/m2) attending a gas-\ntroenterology outpatient clinic were included in the study.\nThe diagnoses included oesophageal stricture, colitis,\ndiverticular disease and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. All\npatients were screened by a nurse with ‘MUST’ and two\nother screening tools: (1) MEREC tool; (2) HH tool (see\nTable 2 for details). Each of the tools (‘MUST’,\nMEREC, HH) categorised patients into three risk cat-\negories: low- (routine clinical care), medium- (observe)\nand high- (treat) risk.\nInvestigations of malnutrition in hospital inpatients\nComparison of the ‘malnutrition universal screening tool’\nwith nutrition risk score and malnutrition screening tool\nin medical inpatients . This study included seventy-ﬁve\nconsecutively admitted elective and emergency medical\npatients (thirty female, forty-ﬁve male: age 44 (\nSD 14)\nyears; BMI 27·0 ( SD 5·48) kg/m2). The reasons for admis-\nsion to hospital were varied and included respiratory infec-\ntions, Crohn’s disease, cancer and accidental falls. Many\npatients were admitted for investigation of gastrointestinal\nor respiratory complaints. All patients were screened\nwithin 72 h of admission to hospital by a fourth-year medi-\ncal undergraduate using ‘MUST’ and two other tools: (1)\nNRS; (2) MST (see Table 2 for details). ‘MUST’ and\nNRS categorised patients into three malnutrition risk cat-\negories (low, medium and high) and MST categorised\npatients into two risk categories. For comparison, the\nthree risk categories for both ‘MUST’ and NRS were\nalso consolidated into two risk categories (low and\nmedium þ high).\nComparison of the ‘malnutrition universal screening\ntool’ with short-form mini nutritional assessment screening\ntool in elderly medical and surgical inpatients . This\nstudy included consecutively admitted elderly medical\npatients ( n 86; age 78 (\nSD 7·37) years, BMI 25·5 ( SD\n5·22) kg/m2)) and surgical (mostly gastrointestinal) patients\n(n 85; age 61 ( SD 20·2) years, BMI 26·7 ( SD 4·70) kg/m2)).\nThe reasons for admission to elderly medical wards\nincluded chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebro-\nvascular accident, pneumonia, angina, heart and renal fail-\nure, and gastrointestinal complaints. The main reasons for\nadmission to the surgical wards were gastrointestinal com-\nplaints, including bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, appendi-\ncitis and cholecystitis. All patients were screened by two\nﬁnal-year nutrition undergraduates using ‘MUST’ and the\nMNA-tool (for details, see Table 2) within 72 h of admis-\nsion to hospital. As the MNA-tool categorised patients\ninto two malnutrition risk categories (not at risk and poss-\nible risk), the two-category combined version of ‘MUST’\n(low and medium þ high) was used for comparison.\nR.

This study included ﬁfty con-\nsecutively admitted medical patients (age 45 (SD 13·9) years,\nBMI 27·3 (SD 6·30) kg/m2). Reasons for hospital admission\nwere varied and included chest pain, shortness of breath,\ngastrointestinal problems (e.g. severe vomiting, gastroenter-\nitis), chronic renal failure and pneumonia. All patients were\nscreened by a fourth-year medical undergraduate using\n‘MUST’ and SGA (for details, see Table 2). SGA cate-\ngorised patients into three risk categories (well nourished,\nmoderately malnourished, severely malnourished), but a\ntwo-category combined version of the SGA (well nourished\nand moderately malnourished þ severely malnourished)\nwas also used for comparison.\nComparison of the ‘malnutrition universal screening\ntool’ with the undernutrition risk score in general surgical\ninpatients. This study included ﬁfty-two consecutively\nadmitted elective and emergency general surgical patients\n(twenty-nine female, twenty-three male: age 62 (\nSD 16)\nyears; BMI 27·7 ( SD 6·08) kg/m2). Reasons for admission\nincluded hernia repair, varicose vein removal, cholecys-\ntectomy and urological surgery. A fourth-year medical\nundergraduate screened all patients using ‘MUST’ and\nURS. The URS categorised patients into three risk\ncategories (low, moderate, high), but a two-category\ncombined version of the URS (low risk and moderate þ\nhigh risk) was also used for comparison.\nStatistical analysis\nTo test the concurrent validity between tools, agreement and\nchance-corrected agreement ( k) between pairs of tools\napplied to the same patients were assessed. A k value of\n1·000 signiﬁes perfect agreement, k of 0·000 no agreement\nand k of 21·000 perfect disagreement. k values 0·400–\n0·750 are considered to indicate ‘fair–good’ agreement and\nk values .0·750 ‘excellent’ agreement beyond chance\n(Landis & Koch, 1977). Power calculations suggested that\nwith sample sizes of 50, 80 and 100 subjects, the estimated\n95 % CI for k (irrespective of the value of k) would be\nk ^ 0·28, k ^ 0·22 and k ^ 0·20 respectively (using two\nrisk categories and a malnutrition prevalence (medium þ\nhigh risk) of 30 %; Cantor, 1996). The binomial test was\nundertaken to examine systematic under- or over-categoris-\nation of malnutrition risk between two tools. For tools with\ntwo categories this corresponds to the McNemar test. Differ-\nences in the prevalence of malnutrition (medium þ high\nrisk) between two tools used in the same patients were\nassessed by the test of paired proportions. Statistical analysis\nwas undertaken using SPSS statistical software package\n(version 11.0; SPSS, Woking, Surrey, UK).\nTable 2.

Using\n‘MUST’, the prevalence of malnutrition in gastroenterol-\nogy outpatients was 30 % (18 % medium-risk and 12 %\nhigh-risk). In hospital, the lowest prevalence of malnu-\ntrition risk was in a group of general surgical patients\n(elective and non-elective surgery for a range of conditions\nincluding hernia repair, varicose vein removal; 19 %) and\nthe highest prevalence was in a group of patients admitted\nmostly for gastrointestinal surgery (60 %). Using other\ntools, the lowest (19 %) and highest (65 %) prevalences\nof malnutrition risk were in general surgical patients\n(using SGA) and elderly medical patients (using MNA-\ntool) respectively (see Fig. 2). Compared with ‘MUST’, a\nsigniﬁcantly higher proportion of patients were identiﬁed\nas being at risk by the URS in general surgical patients\n(35 v.1 9 % ;P¼0·001) and the MNA-tool in elderly medi-\ncal patients (65 v.4 4 % ; P¼0·0005) and a signiﬁcantly\nlower proportion by the MNA-tool in gastrointestinal sur-\ngical patients (47 v.6 0 % ;P¼0·0005) (Fig. 2).\nConcurrent validity of the ‘malnutrition universal\nscreening tool’ with other tools\nHospital outpatients: comparison of the ‘malnutrition uni-\nversal screening tool’ with the MEREC Bulletin tool and\nthe Hickson and Hill tool in gastroenterology\noutpatients. ‘MUST’ had ‘excellent’ agreement beyond\nchance with the MEREC tool ( k 0·825) and ‘fair–good’\nagreement beyond chance with the HH tool ( k 0·647)\n(Landis & Koch, 1977; see Table 3).

However, there was\na signiﬁcant bias when the disagreements in malnutrition\nrisk categorisation between ‘MUST’ and MNA-tool were\nconsidered in these two patient groups (see Table 5).

MST was rated as ‘very easy’ (by one\nmedical undergraduate), MNA-tool as ‘easy’ (by two nutri-\ntion undergraduates) and the other tools (NRS, HH, SGA,\nURS) were rated as ‘difﬁcult’ (by three medical under-\ngraduates, one nurse). ‘MUST’ took 3–5 min, MST 3 min\n(all subjective criteria), MNA-tool 5 min, NRS and HH\n5–7 min, and URS and SGA 5–10 min to complete.\nDiscussion\nThe present study has demonstrated a high prevalence of\nmalnutrition in hospital inpatients (19–65 %) and in a\ngroup of gastroenterology outpatients (28–30 %) using a\nvariety of different tools, including ‘MUST’, which was\nused in all patients (Fig. 2). Although previous compari-\nsons between malnutrition tools have been made, they\nhave almost always involved a comparison of only a\ncouple of tools in a single patient group or setting. Impor-\ntantly, this series of studies has indicated that the overall\nproportion of patients identiﬁed with malnutrition can\nvary signiﬁcantly when different procedures are used in\nthe same patient group. Furthermore, even when different\ntools identify a similar prevalence of malnutrition, the indi-\nviduals identiﬁed at risk may differ (Table 4), which could\nlead to practical difﬁculties in managing patients. The\nabsence of a standard measure with which to identify mal-\nnutrition makes it difﬁcult to easily ascertain which tool\nhas the more ‘correct’ classiﬁcation. Therefore, in such\nindividuals where classiﬁcation of risk differs, identiﬁ-\ncation of which tool most effectively predicts outcome\nmay be one useful indicator. One way that can help resolve\nthe issues of mis-classiﬁcation is to undertake large-scale\nrandomised trials using different tools, addressing both\nclinically and physiologically important outcomes. Another\nproblem is that some tools have been speciﬁcally devel-\noped for certain types of patients in speciﬁc settings (e.g.\nURS for surgical hospital patients (Doyle et al. 2000)),\nwhich means that they should not be used to screen other\ntypes of patients in other settings without previous vali-\ndation. In contrast, ‘MUST’ has been developed for use\nacross all adult patient groups and health care settings.\nThe use of such a tool across adult specialities and health\ncare settings, as in this series of investigations, also high-\nlights how the prevalence of malnutrition varies depending\non the type of patient group, as indicated in Fig. 2. Even\nwithin one speciality (e.g. surgery), when using ‘MUST’\nthe prevalence of malnutrition varies with the type of\nsurgery performed (60 % in a group of predominantly\nnon-elective gastrointestinal surgical patients v. 19 % in a\ngroup of elective and non-elective surgical patients under-\ngoing a range of procedures).\nIn the absence of a universally accepted deﬁnition of\nmalnutrition, it is also difﬁcult to establish the validity of\nany malnutrition-screening tool. Therefore, it is important\nto establish the extent of agreement of a newly developed\nmethod with a previously used and established method for\nidentifying malnutrition (e.g. MNA, SGA), together with\nconsiderations about the reliability, ease of use and predic-\ntive outcome of the method (British Dietetic Association,\n1999; Elia, 2000). The results of the present study suggest\nthat ‘MUST’ has ‘fair–good’ to ‘excellent’ concurrent val-\nidity (k0·431 to 0·893) with a range of previously published\ntools used in clinical practice, with the exception of the URS\ntool for surgical patients (k0·255). The extent of agreement\nbetween tools depends on the criteria they include. In an out-\npatient clinic, there was ‘excellent’ agreement beyond\nchance ( k 0·893) between ‘MUST’ and the MEREC tool,\npossibly due to their simplicity and the use of a number of\ncommon screening criteria (BMI, % weight loss). Agreement\nbetween ‘MUST’ and HH (community version of the NRS)\nwas poorer ( k 0·711, ‘fair–good’ chance-corrected agree-\nment), which may have been due to HH employing a greater\ntotal number of criteria (n 5) and including more subjective\ncriteria than ‘MUST’. The hospital version of this tool\n(NRS; Reilly et al. 1995) had ‘excellent’ agreement\nbeyond chance with ‘MUST’ (three-category (k 0·775) and\ntwo-category ( k 0·813)). This difference in agreement\nbetween the hospital and community versions of this tool\nmay have been due to different investigators undertaking\nthe screening in these two studies (medical undergraduate\nin the hospital, nurse in the outpatient setting). Although\n‘MUST’ has been shown to have ‘excellent’ inter-rater\nreliability (k0·809–1·000) in a large series of investigations\nbetween different health care workers (Elia, 2000, 2003;\nStratton et al. 2003a), the reproducibility of the NRS and\nHH tools between a variety of different health care pro-\nfessionals has not been undertaken as far as we are aware\n(Reilly et al. (1995) suggests that fourteen out of nineteen\nassessments agree between nurse and state registered dieti-\ntian). Therefore, the possibility of bias in results of concur-\nrent validity tests undertaken by the same individual (e.g.\nin the present study, ‘MUST’ and MEREC, ‘MUST’ and\nHH) or different individuals within the same profession\nshould also be considered. Alternatively, the differences in\nagreement could be due to slight differences that exist\nbetween the NRS and its community version (HH; Hickson\n& Hill, 1997). In the hospital, there was also ‘excellent’\nagreement (k 0·783) between ‘MUST’ and the assessment\ntool SGA (two-category) in newly admitted general medical\npatients, although the investigator (a fourth-year medical\nundergraduate) did not categorise any patients into the mal-\nnourished group when using the SGA. ‘MUST’ had ‘fair–\ngood’ agreement beyond chance with other screening tools\ninvestigated in the present study, including MST (two-cat-\negory, k 0·707) in general medical patients, the MNA-tool\n(two-category) in elderly medical (k0·551) and gastrointes-\ntinal surgical (k 0·605) patients, and URS (two-category, k\n0·431) in general surgical inpatients. However, the agree-\nment of ‘MUST’ with the URS (three-category versions)\nwas ‘poor’ (k 0·255). This poorer agreement is likely to\nhave been due to the use of very different criteria by the\ntwo tools, with the inclusion of many more criteria (seven\nv. three), mostly subjective, in the URS (Doyle et al. 2000),\nwhich unusually included constipation and increasing appe-\ntite as risk factors. In addition to the poor agreement between\nR. J. Stratton et al.806\nhttps://doi.org/10.1079/BJN20041258\n Published online by Cambridge University Press\nthese two tools, there was also a systematic over-categoris-\nation of risk by the URS relative to ‘MUST’. There was\nonly one other tool with which there was a systematic bias\nrelative to ‘MUST’. The MNA-tool systematically over-\ncategorised in elderly medical patients and under-cate-\ngorised in surgical patients the risk of malnutrition relative\nto ‘MUST’. A possible reason for this is that the MNA-tool\nwas initially developed for use in the elderly, whilst\n‘MUST’ was developed for use in all adults. Furthermore,\nthe MNA-tool investigated in the present study was the\nshort-form screening component (criteria A to F) of a\nlarger assessment tool, the MNA (eighteen criteria, A to\nR). Although the MNA was developed and widely validated\nin elderly people, the use of the short-form as a screening tool\n(criteria A to F; Murphyet al. 2000; Rubenstein et al. 2001),\ntermed MNA-tool in the present paper, appears to have been\nless extensively validated in prospective trials. Another\npossible reason for the differences in categorisation may be\nthat the action plans following use of the MNA-tool and\n‘MUST’ are different, in that those patients identiﬁed as at\nrisk of malnutrition with the MNA-tool are then assessed\nfurther with the full MNA. Therefore, the results of\n‘MUST’ were also compared with those of the full MNA\nassessment tool (three risk categories: not at risk, at risk of\nmalnutrition, malnourished) carried out in the present study\nby the same investigators. The bias between tools remained\n(signiﬁcant over-categorisation of risk in elderly medical\n(P¼0·004), signiﬁcant under-categorisation in gastrointesti-\nnal surgical ( P¼0·0005) patients with MNA relative to\n‘MUST’) reﬂected in the lowkvalues (elderly 0·450, surgi-\ncal 0·356).\nIt is desirable that a screening procedure is rapid and\neasy to use. The results of the present study suggested\nthat screening with ‘MUST’ was quick (3–5 min) and\n‘very easy’ or ‘easy’ to use in the patient groups studied.\nSome of the procedures evaluated in this investigation\n(e.g. SGA, NRS, URS) were found to be lengthier and\nharder to use than ‘MUST’.\nIn summary, the present study demonstrates that there is\na high prevalence of malnutrition in a group of hospital\noutpatients (30 %) and groups of inpatients (up to 60 %)\nusing ‘MUST’. ‘MUST’ is easy and quick to use and has\n‘fair–good’ to ‘excellent’ concurrent validity ( k 0·431 –\n0·893) with most of the other tools tested.\nAcknowledgements\nR.S. is currently funded by a BAPEN–ESPEN Research\nFellowship.\nReferences\nAkner G & Cederholm T (2001) Treatment of protein–energy\nmalnutrition in chronic nonmalignant disorders.
