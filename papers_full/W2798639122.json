  "abstract": "The development of power electronics and power systems due to the massive integration of renewable energy sources is challenging the distribution grids. Among several concepts, the Smart Transformer (ST), a solid-state transformer with advanced control and communication capabilities, has been investigated by several researchers. A great challenge of this kind of system is the possibility to test the effectiveness of the physical system under a broad spectrum of operating conditions. For this reason, the Power Hardware in the Loop (PHIL) concept can be adopted to emulate the behavior of a distribution grid connected to the ST. In this case, because the low-voltage stage of the ST is voltage controlled, the test setup must be current-controlled. In this paper, the current-controlled PHIL setup is analyzed. The theorethical analysis is carried out and preliminary results obtained with the PHIL facilities are presented, highlighting how the current-controlled PHIL can be an effective means to study the ST.",
