    "abstract": "In this paper a robust three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) anisotropy model is introduced based on a particular scalar potential formulation. The specific 3D FE model is suitable for the accurate evaluation of the peak flux density distribution and no load loss of one-phase and three-phase wound core distribution transformers. The accuracy of the proposed 3D FE anisotropy model is validated by local flux density and no load loss measurements. © 2008 IEEE.",
