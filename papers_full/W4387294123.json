    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly. Such models have\\ndemonstrated strong capabilities in learning from large-scale (unstructured)\\ntext data and answering user queries. Users do not need to be experts in\\nstructured query languages to interact with systems built upon such models.\\nThis provides great opportunities to reduce the barrier of information\\nretrieval for the general public. By introducing LLMs into spatial data\\nmanagement, we envisage an LLM-based spatial database system to learn from both\\nstructured and unstructured spatial data. Such a system will offer seamless\\naccess to spatial knowledge for the users, thus benefiting individuals,\\nbusiness, and government policy makers alike.\\n",
