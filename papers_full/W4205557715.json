Once it fails, \nit will cause power interruption, which seriously influence \neconomic production and living activities [2 ]. Thus, it is \nof great necessity to detect and diagnose incipient fault in \npower transformers [3].\nIn recent years, diagnosis incipient fault in power trans-\nformers has been studied by many scholars and experts and \ntransformer fault diagnosis problem is solved with different \napproaches. The aim of all these studies is to meet the reli-\nability requirements of power supply in order to minimize \ndevice damages and reduce economic, social and personal \nlosses. Various approaches have been used to solve trans-\nformer fault diagnosis problem such as frequency response \nanalysis [4], the vibration analysis [5], dissolved gas analysis \n(DGA) [6], etc.\nAmong these methods, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a \nwidely used technique to detect the incipient faults in power \ntransformers [7 , 8]. Many researchers have put forward a \nlarge number of DGA-based methods. Traditional methods \nbased on DGA such as IEEE key gases [9 ], Rogers ratios \n[10], IEC standard code [11], Dornenburg ratios [12], Duval \ntriangle [13], IEC 60599 [14], have been applied to trans-\nformer fault diagnosis.\nIn addition to these traditional methods, artificial intel-\nligence (AI) methods based on DGA have been recently used \nin the field of transformer fault diagnosis, including artificial \nneural networks(ANN) [15], support vector machine(SVM) \n[16], fuzzy logic (FL) [17], adaptive neuro fuzzy inference \nsystem (ANFIS) [18],random forest (RF) [19], Bayesian net-\nwork [20], gene expression programming(GEP) [ 21], time \nseries analysis [22], expert system [23], association rule \n * Guoqing An \n anguoqing99@sina.com\n1 College of Electric and Engineering, Hebei University \nof Science and Technology, Shi Jiazhuang 050018, China\n2 Hebei Provincial Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic \n& Structural Performance of Power Transmission \nand Transformation Equipment, Baoding Tianwei Baobian \nElectric Co., Ltd, Bao Ding 071056, China\n3 Hebei Weixun Electric Power Automation Equipment Co., \nLtd, Heng Shui 053000, China\n1994 Journal of Electrical Engineering & Technology (2022) 17:1993–2001\n1 3\n[24], set pair analysis [25], evidential reasoning [26], etc. \nThe various proposed methods have produced good results \nand made an important contribution in the field of trans-\nformer fault diagnosis. These methods tend to build models \nthat can bridge the relationship between machines data and \nmachines health states [27].\nNowadays, deep learning theories have also been pro-\nposed for transform fault diagnosis with the development of \ncalculation capacity [28]. Deep learning can realize end-to-\nend learning and avoid tedious feature engineering and build \na black box model compared with traditional AI methods. \nHowever, it requires a lot of iterations and weight updates \nwith time-consuming gradient computing. A new model \nbased on extreme learning machine (ELM) was introduced \nto identify the state of transformer to solve the efficiency \ndegradation caused by gradient update [29]. The ELM \nmodel outperformed ANN and other traditional methods. \nHowever, stochastic selection of the number of hidden layer \nnodes is easily leads to low stability and poor robustness of \nthe model in the application [30].\nBy analyzing the reviewed articles, despite different diag-\nnosis models have been presented by various scholars and \nexperts, a precise diagnosis model is still needed yet. For \nthis purpose, a novel fault diagnosis model based on HHO-\nKELM for power transformers is proposed in this study.\nThe contributions of this study are as follows: (1) Non-\ncode ratios set is selected as the characterizing vector for \nKELM model. (2) A parameter optimization method based \non HHO is adopted to obtain the optimal model param-\neters of KELM automatically. (3) The established HHO-\nKELM model is applied to diagnose incipient fault in power \ntransformers.\nThe remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows: \nSect. 2 describes the proposed method; Sect.  3 presents the \nproposed fault diagnosis approach based on HHO-KELM; \nIn Sect. 4, the results and analysis discussion are given. Sec-\ntion 5 concludes the summary.\n2  The Proposed Method\nA. Kernel Extreme Learning Machine\nKernel extreme learning machine (KELM) [30] is a kind \nof machine learning algorithm with strongest ability and \ngeneralization ability which is proposed on the basis of ELM \nand kernel functions. On the basis of ELM, the learning \nmethod of KELM is described as follows:\nGiven N different samples (xj, tj)∈R n × R m  , j= 1, …,N  , \nwhere xj =[ xj1 ,xj2 ,… ,xjn]T  is the input samples, \ntj =[ tj1 ,tj2 ,… ,tjm ]T  is the encoded class label. The math-\nematical model of ELM can be described as below:\nwhere, L is the neurons number in the hidden layer, w i, bi, /u1D6FDi \nare the input weights, hidden layer bias and output weights \nof the ith hidden neuron node respectively, g(xi, w i, bi) is the \nactivation function. Equation (1) can be written in a matrix \nform as:\nwhere /u1D401=[ /u1D6FD1 ,… ,/u1D6FDL]T represents the vector of output layer \nweights, /u1D413=[ t1 ,… ,tN ]T  is the corresponding coding class \nlabel, and H is the hidden layer output matrix:\nThe training of ELM is equivalent to solving the least \nsquares solution of linear Eq. (2), which is defined as:\nThe least square solution of the output weight is calcu-\nlated as:\nwhere C is the regularization parameter. The output function \nfor ELM is implemented as:\nWhen the hidden layer function h(x) is unknown, the ker-\nnel function matrix is calculated as:\nwhere K (xi, xj) represents the kernel function. The radial \nbasis function (RBF) is applied in this paper, which is given \nby:\n(1)\nL/uni2211.s1\ni=1\n/u1D6FDig(xj,w i,bi)= tj, j= 1, … ,N\n(2)/u1D407/u1D401= /u1D413\n(3)/u1D407=\n⎡\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢⎣\nh(x1 )\n⋮\nh(xN )\n⎤\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥⎦\n=\n⎡\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢⎣\ng(x1 ,w1 ,b1 ) ⋯ g(x1 ,wL,bL)\n⋮⋮⋮\ng(xN ,w1 ,b1 ) ⋯ g(x1 ,wL,bL)\n⎤\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥⎦\n(4)/uni2016.x/uni2016.x/uni2016.x/u1D407(w1,… ,w L,b1,… ,bL)̂/u1D401− T/uni2016.x/uni2016.x/uni2016.x= min\n𝛽i\n/uni2016.x/uni2016.x/u1D407(w1,… ,w L,b1,… ,bL)/u1D401− /u1D413/uni2016.x/uni2016.x\n(5)\n∧\n/u1D401= /u1D407T (I∕C + /u1D407/u1D407T )−1T\n(6)f(x)= h(x)\n∧\n/u1D401= h(x)H T (I∕C + HH T )−1T\n(7)\n/braceleft.s3ΩELM = /u1D407/u1D407T\nΩij= h(xi) ⋅ h(xj)= K (xi,xj)\n(8)K (xi,xj)=exp\n⎛\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜⎝\n−\n���xi − xj\n���\n2\n/u1D70E\n⎞\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟⎠\n1995Journal of Electrical Engineering & Technology (2022) 17:1993–2001 \n1 3\nThen, the output function of KELM can be obtained as:\nB. Harris Hawks Optimization Algorithm\nHarris hawks optimization (HHO) is a newly intro-\nduced metaheuristic optimization technique by Heidari in \n2019 [31], which contains the phases of exploration and \nexploitation.\n1. Exploration Phase\nIn this stage, Harris hawks detect the prey through two \nstrategies. The first strategy assumes that the hawks allo-\ncate close to the team members and the prey. In the sec-\nond strategy, the hawks place on random trees. These two \nstrategies can be described as:\nwhere X(t) and X(t + 1) represent the hawk's positions at the \ncurrent iteration t  and the next iteration t  + 1, respectively. \nXprey(t) is the position of prey. Xrand (t) is a randomly selected \nhawk from the current position. r 1,r2,r3,r4 and K  are ran-\ndomly generated number between [0, 1]. LB and UB are the \nlower and upper bounds of control variables. X m(t) is the \naverage position of hawks which calculated as:\nwhere, N is the total number of hawks. X i(t) is the position \nof each hawk in iteration t.\n2. Ransition from Exploration to Exploitation\nThe change from the exploration to exploitation in the \nHHO can be modeled based on the prey escaping energy \nas:\nwhere, E indicates the escaping energy of the prey. E 0 is \nthe initial energy of the prey which is generated randomly \nbetween [−1, 1]. T  is the maximum number of iterations. \nTherefore, if E  < 1, this means the prey is weak, hence the \nhawks should exploit close to the prey location, and if E > 1, \nthis means the prey has enough energy to escape, so the \nhawks should continue exploring the prey location.\n(9)\nf(x)= h(x)H T(I∕C + HH T)−1 T =\n⎡\n⎢\n⎢\n⎢⎣\nK (x,x1 )\n⋮\nK (x,xN )\n⎤\n⎥\n⎥\n⎥⎦\nT\n(I∕C +Ω ELM )−1 T\n(10)\nX(t+ 1)=\n/braceleft.s3Xrand(t)− r1/uni007C.x/uni007C.xXrand(t)−2r 2X(t)/uni007C.x/uni007C.xK ≥ 0.5\n(Xprey(t)−X m (t)) − r3(LB + r4(UB − LB)) K < 0.5\n(11)Xm (t)= 1\nN\nN/uni2211.s1\ni=1\nXi(t)\n(12)E = 2E 0\n/parenleft.s2\n1 − t\nT\n/parenright.s2\n3. Exploitation Phase\nThe exploitation process of HHO has been modeled \nbased on the escaping energy of prey E  and its chance for \nescaping r. There are four chasings besiege in the exploi-\ntation phase of HHO.\na: Soft Besiege ( r ≥ 0.5 and /uni007C.varE/uni007C.var≥ 0.5).\nIn soft besiege phase, the prey tries to escape using ran-\ndom jumps, but the hawks surround it softly. This process \ncan be expressed as:\nwhere ΔX (t) is the distance between the prey position and \nthe hawks’ position in iteration t . K = 2(1-r5) indicates the \nstrength of the prey randomly jumping during the escaping. \nr5 is a random number ranged from [0, 1].\nb: Hard Besiege ( r ≥ 0.5 and /uni007C.varE/uni007C.var< 0.5).\nIn hard besiege mode, the prey becomes too exhausted \nto escape. As a result, the hawks effortlessly catch the \nprey, and then pounce on it. This move can be modeled as:\nc: Soft Besiege with Progressive Rapid Dives ( r < 0.5 \nand /uni007C.varE/uni007C.var≥ 0.5).\nIn soft besieges with progressive rapid dives approach, \nthe prey able to escape and the hawks softly surround it. \nTo model this besiege, a levy fight (LF) concept is used \nas follows:\nwhere H is the soft besiege positions. The hawks dive based \non the LF as:\nwhere D is the dimension of problem. S is a random vector \nby size 1 × D. The LF is calculated as:\nwhere/u1D6FD is a constant value set to 1.5. u  and v  are random \nvalues between [0,1].\nFinally, the updating position of hawks is calculated as:\n(13)X (t+ 1)=Δ X (t)−E /uni007C.x/uni007C.x/uni007C.xKX prey(t)−X (t)/uni007C.x/uni007C.x/uni007C.x\n(14)X (t+ 1)= X prey(t)−X (t)\n(15)X (t+ 1)= X prey(t)−E /uni007C.varΔX (t)/uni007C.var\n(16)H = Xprey(t)−E /uni007C.x/uni007C.x/uni007C.xKX prey(t)− X (t)/uni007C.x/uni007C.x/uni007C.x\n(17)G = H + S× LF(D)\n(18)LF (x)= 0.01 × u × /u1D70E\n/uni007C.varv/uni007C.var\n1\n/u1D6FD\n(19)/u1D70E=\n⎛\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜⎝\nΓ(1 + /u1D6FD)× sin\n�\n/u1D70B/u1D6FD\n2\n�\nΓ\n�\n1+/u1D6FD\n2\n�\n× /u1D6FD× 2\n�\n/u1D6FD−1\n2\n�\n⎞\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟⎠\n1\n/u1D6FD\n1996 Journal of Electrical Engineering & Technology (2022) 17:1993–2001\n1 3\nd: Hard Besiege with Progressive Rapid Dives ( r < 0.5 \nand /uni007C.varE/uni007C.var< 0.5).\nIn hard besieges with progressive rapid dives case, \nthe behavior of the prey is similar to its behavior in the \ncase of a soft besiege. The position of team members is \nupdated by reducing the distance between their average \nposition and the prey position. This motion is described \nas:\nwhere Xm(t) is obtained from Eq. (11).\nC. The Proposed HHO-KELM Method\nThe diagnosis performance of KELM is affected by \nthe penalty factor C and kernel parameter σ. In order to \nobtain the optimal parameters of the KELM, we optimize \nthe penalty factor C  and the parameter σ  of the kernel \nfunction by HHO. The specific steps of HHO optimizing \nKELM parameters are described as follows:\nStep 1: Initialize the KELM parameters C, σ and the \nparameters of HHO, including the number of search \nagents N, the number of iterations T  and D -dimensional \nspace.\nStep 2: Calculate the objective function value of each \nhawks through the Eq. (9 ) and update the position of X prey. \nThe fitness function of the HHO in the optimization pro-\ncess is the mean square error (MSE), which is:\nwhere yD and y represent the measure value and the observed \nvalue. M represents the number of observation samples.\nStep 3: Update the initial energy, jump strength and \nescaping energy of each individual in each iteration.\nStep 4: Determine whether the number of iterations is \nequal to the maximum value. If it is not, execute t  = t + 1 \nand return to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.\nStep 5:  Export HHO optimal solutions (values of C \nand σ).\nThe flow chart of this procedure is described in Fig.  1.\n(20)X (t+ 1)=\n/braceleft.s3H if F (H ) < F (X (t))\nG if F (G) < F (X (t))\n(21)X (t+ 1)=\n/braceleft.s3H\n�\nif F(H\n�\n) < F (X (t))\nG\n�\nif F(G\n�\n) < F (X (t))\n(22)H\n�\n= Xprey(t)−E /uni007C.x/uni007C.x/uni007C.xKX prey(t)−X m (t)/uni007C.x/uni007C.x/uni007C.x\n(23)G\n�\n= H\n�\n+ S× LF(D)\n(24)MSE = 1\nM\n/uni2211.s1M\ni=1 (yD (i)− y(i))2\n3  Transformer Fault Diagnosis\n3.1  Model Based on HHO‑KELM\nA. Transformer Fault Types and Input Characterizing \nVector Selection\nFaults inside transformers are classified in thermal faults \nand electrical faults according to [ 32]. Thermal faults are \nlow and medium thermal (LM-T) and high thermal (H-T) \ncategorized by means of temperature in the range of \nTLM-T < 700 °C and TH-T > 700 °C, respectively. Electri-\ncal faults are low-energy discharge (LE-D) and high-energy \ndischarge (HE-D). In addition this work takes the normal \nstate (NS) into account to distinguish between normal mode \nand failure mode.\nThe above incipient faults caused by oil and insulation \npaper decomposition can generate several kinds of gases: \nhydrogen  (H2), methane  (CH4), acetylene  (C2H2), ethylene \n (C2H4), ethane  (C2H6), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon \ndioxide  (CO2). Based on this gases, Non-code ratios are \ntaken as the input characterizing parameter of the diagnostic \nmodel in this paper. Non-code ratios include  CH4/H2,  C2H4/\nC2H2,  C2H4/C2H6,  C2H2/(C1 +  C2),  H2/(H2 +  C1 +  C2),  C2H4/\nFig. 1  The flowchart of HHO optimizing KELM parameters\n1997Journal of Electrical Engineering & Technology (2022) 17:1993–2001 \n1 3\n(C1 +  C2),  CH4/(C1 +  C2),  C2H6/(C1 +  C2) and  (CH4 +  C2H4)/\n(C1 +  C2). Of these,  C1 represents  CH4 and  C2 represents the \nsum of  C2H4,  C2H6 and  C2H2.\nB. Transformer Fault Diagnosis Model Based on HHO-\nKELM\nIn this study, a fault diagnosis model based on HHO-\nKELM for transformers is established. It can be divided into \nthree parts: data collection and processing, the training of \nthe network, and the performance testing and evaluation of \nthe network model.\nIn the data collection and processing part, some dissolved \ngas content of transformer is firstly collected from the trans-\nformer faults records as DGA data, the collected DGA data \nare then transformed to non-code ratios. When the ratio with \n0/0 is set to “0” and c/0 to 20, where c is not “0” [33].The \nobtained DGA ratios are then normalized to clear up the \ninfluence of order of magnitude, shown as:\nwhere xsi and xi are the DGA ratios before and after normali-\nzation, ximax and ximin and are the maximum and minimum \nvalue of a DGA ratio.\nIn the network training part, a training dataset is con -\nstructed by using DGA records with transformer fault \ntypes. The characterizing vectors are input to the KELM \nnetwork. The KELM adopts the HHO algorithm to obtain \nthe model parameters. The learnt feature shows the relation-\nships between the DGA ratios and the corresponding fault \npatterns.\nAfter the training process, the diagnostic parameters are \nobtained. Then, the types of faults are classified for the sam-\nples in the testing set or the transformer under investigation \nwith the trained diagnostic parameters. Accuracy is taken \ninto consideration to appraise the capability of fault diag-\nnosis approach which is computed by:\nwhere Ncorrect is the number of samples correctly diagnosed, \nNtotal is the total number of samples in the whole dataset.\nThe implementation process of the proposed fault diag-\nnosis model is described as follows:\nStep1: Obtain the DGA data of transformers through the \nacquisition device.\nStep2: Transform DGA data to Non-code ratios.\nStep3: Normalize the obtained DGA ratios and construct \na feature vector.\nStep4: Divide the data into a training set and testing set. \nThe training set is used to train a diagnostic model.\n(25)xsi = xi − ximin\nximax − ximin\n(26)A = N correct\nN total\nStep5: The testing set is selected to test and evaluate the \nperformance of the proposed model.\nThe flow chart of the proposed transformer fault diagnosis \nmodel is shown in Fig. 2.\n4  Results and Analysis\nA. Test Data\nDGA samples are collected from IEC TC 10 database \n[11], as shown in Table 1. These samples are used to evalu-\nate the performance of the proposed fault diagnosis method.\nB. Model Parameters\nThe relevant parameters of HHO and KELM for trans-\nformer fault diagnosis are detailed in Table 2.\nC. Transformer Fault Diagnosis Results\nFig. 2  The flow chart of the proposed fault diagnosis model\nTable 1  Test data of IEC TC 10 database\nFault types LM-T H-T LE-D HE-D NS\nIEC TC 10 database 10 14 23 45 26\n1998 Journal of Electrical Engineering & Technology (2022) 17:1993–2001\n1 3\nIn order to investigate the accuracy of HHO-KELM for \ntransformer fault diagnosis, 93 samples out of total 118 cases \nare used to train KELM structure parameters and the rest \n25 samples (5 samples of each fault) are employed to test \ndiagnosis capability of the trained KELM.\nFigure 3 reports the typical HHO fitness variation curves. \nIt is found that the converge time is 11.2693 s and the fitness \nvalue (mean square error) reaches 0.1708 after the second \niteration, and then remain flat for a while. After the fifth \niteration, the fitness value is reduced to 0.1630, which is \nthe best value. This illustrates that the HHO algorithm can \nconverge to the best solution very quickly.\nThe diagnosis results based on HHO-KELM are present \nas Fig. 4. It can be seen that HHO-KELM has four errors in \ntraining samples, and the classification accuracy is 95.7% \n(89/93). In the test samples, three errors are generated in the \ntype of faults, and the classification accuracy is 88% (22/25). \nThis indicates that the proposed method has good accuracy.\nD. Comparisons with Different Input Characterizing \nVector\nIn order to further determine the proposed method, the \ninput characterizing vectors of HHO-KELM are divided into four categories: (1)All the DGA data  (H2,  CH4,  C2H2,  C2H4, \n C2H6, CO,  CO2); (2) IEC Rations  (CH4/H2,  C2H2/C2H4 and \n C2H4/C2H6); (3) Rogers Ratios  (CH4/H2,  C2H2/C2H4,  C2H4/\nC2H6 and  C2H6/CH4); (4)Non-code Rations. The above four \ndifferent types of characterizing parameters are modeled \nin KELM for diagnosis and the fault diagnosis results are \nreported in Table 3 and Fig. 5.\nAs seen in Table  3 and Fig.  5, HHO-KELM with Non-\ncode ratios can detect LM-T better than others. HHO-KELM \nwith IEC ratios and Rogers ratios can not detect LM-T prop-\nerly. HHO-KELM with Non-code ratios has the best perfor-\nmance for H-T as well. The accuracy of HHO-KELM with \nNon-code ratios for LE-D is same to HHO-KELM with IEC \nratios and Rogers ratios. All methods except HHO-KELM \nwith all the DGA data, can detect HE-D and N-S properly.\nIn short, the HHO-KELM with Non-code ratios shows \nthe highest total accuracy. With the input vector of Non-code \nratios, the average accuracy of HHO-KELM is increased sig-\nnificantly compared to HHO-KELM with all the DGA data, \nTable 2  Parameters of KELM and HHO\nAlgorithms Parameters Values\nHHO The population size N 20\nThe maximum iteration number T 100\nDimension D 2\nKELM The range of penalty factor C [0.1, 50]\nThe range of kernel parameter σ [0.1, 10]\n01 02 03 04 05 0\nNumeber of Iterations\n0.16\n0.17\n0.18\n0.19\n0.2\n0.21\n0.22\nFitness value\nFig. 3  The fitness variation curves of HHO\nThed iagnosisr esults on training samples\nThed iagnosis results on test samples\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4  The diagnosis results using HHO-KELM model. a The diag-\nnosis results on training samples. b The diagnosis results on test sam-\nples\n1999Journal of Electrical Engineering & Technology (2022) 17:1993–2001 \n1 3\nIEC ratios and Rogers ratios, the average accuracy for testing \nsamples is increased by 60%, 32% and 24%, respectively.\nE. Comparisons with Different Diagnostic Methods\nIn order to verify the diagnosis performance, the ELM, \nKELM, GA-KELM and PSO-KELM with the input vec-\ntor of Non-code ratios are selected to compare with the \nHHO-KELM.\nFigure 6 shows the relationship between the fitness value \n(mean square error) and the number of iterations for differ -\nent algorithms in the optimization process for KELM. It can \nbe seen from Fig.  6 that the HHO-ELM model reduces the \nnumber of iterations and can find a stable solution close to \nthe best goal. The reason the original ELM, KELM are not \nrepresented in the iteration number versus fitness plot is that \nthe original ELM, KELM did not incorporate an intelligent \noptimization algorithm and did not ensure fitness.\nThe fault diagnosis results for five different methods are \nshown in Table 4 and Fig. 7.\nAccording to Table 4 and Fig. 7, HHO-KELM has better \nperformance than other methods for detection of LM-T. The \nworst method for detecting LM-T is ELM and KELM. ELM, \nPSO-KELM, GA-KELM and HHO-KELM can effectively \ndiagnose H-T fault. However, HHO-KELM method is weak \nin detecting LE-D and is lower than PSO-KELM. All meth-\nods have better performance for HE-D. For N-S, GA-KELM \nand HHO-KELM have better accuracy than ELM, KELM \nand PSO-KELM.\nIt can be concluded that HHO-KELM has the best aver -\nage accuracy. Compared with ELM, KELM, GA-KELM \nand PSO-KELM, the average fault diagnosis accuracy of \nTable 3  HHO-KELM diagnosis results using different characterizing \nvectors\nFaults All the DGA \ndata (%)\nIEC Ratios (%) Rogers \nRatios (%)\nNon-code \nRatios \n(%)\nLM-T 20 0 0 80\nH-T 20 20 60 100\nLE-D 0 60 60 60\nHE-D 100 100 100 100\nNS 0 100 100 100\nAverage 28 56 64 88\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nLM-T H-TL E-DH E-DN S\nAll the DGA data IEC Ratios\nRogers Ratios Non-code Ratios\nFig. 5  HHO-KELM diagnosis results using different characterizing \nvectors\n01 02 03 04 05 0\nNumber of iterations\n0.16\n0.18\n0.2\n0.22\n0.24\n0.26\nFitness value\nPSO-KELM\nGA-KELM\nHHO-KELM\nFig. 6  The relationship between the fitness value and the number of \niterations for different algorithms\nTable 4  Diagnosis results using different methods\nFaults ELM (%) KELM (%) PSO-\nKELM \n(%)\nGA-KELM \n(%)\nHHO-\nKELM \n(%)\nLM-T 20 20 40 60 80\nH-T 100 60 100 100 100\nLE-D 60 60 80 60 60\nHE-D 100 100 100 100 100\nNS 20 80 80 100 100\nAverage 60 64 80 84 88\n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\nLM-T H-TL E-DH E-DN S\nELMK ELMP SO-KELM\nGA-KELM HHO-KELM\nFig. 7  Diagnosis results using different methods\n2000 Journal of Electrical Engineering & Technology (2022) 17:1993–2001\n1 3\nHHO-KELM is increased by 28%, 24%, 8%, and 4% for test-\ning set, which show that the HHO-KELM has higher clas -\nsification accuracy than those of the other compared method.\nF. Fault Diagnosis Using China Transformers DGA \nData\nIn order to investigate fault diagnosis capability of the \nproposed method comprehensively, 180 DGA samples \nof transformers in China are diagnosed by HHO-KELM. \nThe180 samples are divided into two parts, of which 130 \nsamples are used to train HHO-KELM model and the other \n50 samples (10 samples of each fault) are tested with the \ntrained model. Figure  8 presents a high accuracy of 90% \n(46/50) for China DGA data, which shows that the proposed \nmethod has better performance.\n5  Conclusion\nIn this work, a fault diagnosis method based on HHO-KELM \nis presented to diagnose the different fault states of trans-\nformers. The proposed model is solved using non-code ratios \nas the input vector, Furthermore, HHO algorithm is imple-\nmented to optimize the KELM model parameters. Finally, \nsome numerical analysis are proposed in order to demon-\nstrate the validity of the proposed strategy. The comparison \nresults show that the average test accuracy of the Non-code \nratios feature set is 60%, 32% and 24% higher than that of the \nDGA full data, the IEC ratios and the Rogers ratios feature \nquantity respectively. Also, the accuracy of the HHO-KELM \nmodel for transformer fault diagnosis reaches 88% which is \nhigher than the model of ELM, KELM, PSO-KELM model \nand GA-KELM. Considering the presented results, it can \nbe said that the proposed method outperforms all compared \ndiagnosis models and is an accurate model for solving such \nproblems.\nHowever, some shortcomings still existence in the study, \nsuch as the insufficient data samples. Additional datasets \ncould be considered in future work in order to validate the \nproposed method by means of fault diagnosis accuracy.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to express their apprecia-\ntion of the support by Hebei provincial Key Research and Development \nProgram (20312101D).\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attri-\nbution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adapta-\ntion, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long \nas you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \nprovide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes \nwere made.
