Humans are able to see, feel,\nhear and so on, using their senses. Our ability to intelligently process this multimodal information\nis what makes us highly effective beings. Currently, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is\ngenerally concerned with developing capabilities for individual data modalities that encode specific\ninformation about our surroundings. In this regard, in the form of recent breakthroughs such as\nGPT-4 [85] for multimodal data (image and text), ChatGPT for text, DALL-E 2 [ 96] and Stable\nDiffusion [100] for the visual data, we are already witnessing human-level intelligence of machines.\nHowever, the ultimate objective to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) demands much more.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee\nprovided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and\nthe full citation on the first page.

(Center) Categories of publication contributions to different sub-fields of Science - generated\nwith data from the Web of Science. (Right) Distribution as document type (data collected from Scopus).\nThe ability to handle and leverage information encoded in multimodal data is one of the basic needs\nof AGI. With the availability of increasingly powerful computational resources, this realization is\nfast re-writing the guiding principles for the research communities in different sub-fields of AI.\nIn the domain of Computer Vision, human action recognition is a long-standing problem [138].\nThis article follows Herath et al. [ 45], treating human action as “the most elementary human-\nsurrounding interaction with a meaning. ” Human action recognition is thus the automated labelling\nprocess of human actions within a given sequence of visual frames. Due to its widespread practical\napplications, ranging from safety [117] to healthcare [161], particularly for COVID [95] and many\nother downstream tasks [32, 35, 94], human action recognition has historically received significant\nattention within the vision research community. Recent years have also seen the emergence of\nnumerous multimodal approaches for this task, which define the research direction of Multimodal\nHuman Action Recognition (MHAR). Multimodal data fusion refers to the mixing of features from\ndata of various modalities. Fusion analysis has been extensively used in several domains including\nactivity recognition [79], 3D shape classification [83] and predicting human eye fixation [47], as\nevident through relevant works.\nPresently, MHAR systems have been explored in various real-world scenarios of indoor and\noutdoor settings that relate to the application domains of healthcare [13, 147], smart homes [68,\n81, 108], surveillance systems [10, 57, 123], social relations recognition [142] and numerous other\ndomains [119, 121]. It is evident from the existing literature that owing to the diversity of data,\nthe research direction of MHAR has its own unique challenges and opportunities when compared\nto conventional action recognition tasks [ 80]. To contextualize this, early research in human\naction recognition was limited to only analysing still color images or videos [40, 157]. The MHAR\nproblem demands accounting for different data modalities while providing the opportunity for\nimproved performance due to the availability of complementary information in different modalities.\nNevertheless, it is worth noting here that the typical challenges of classical action recognition, (e.g.,\nbackground clutter, partial object occlusion, viewpoint variations, lighting changes, and execution\nrate etc.) remain equally pertinent to MHAR techniques.\nThis survey focuses on MHAR approaches that use computer vision and signal-processing\ntechniques to recognize human actions. Generally, techniques based on multimodal data are\nmotivated based on the expectation to achieve better performance than unimodal data techniques.\nHowever, MHAR research has also shown other motivational sources in the form of the development\nof cost-effective sensing (e.g., ASUS Xtion [50], Microsoft Kinect [143], and Intel RealSense [15])\nand widespread gain in the computational power. Combined, these factors currently propel MHAR\n2\nFrom CNNs to Transformers in Multimodal Human Action Recognition: A Survey ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY\nFig. 2. A typical multimodal fusion-based action recognition pipeline.\nresearch to an unprecedented pace. Accordingly, there has been a growing number of MHAR-related\npublications in the last few years - see Fig. 1 (left). Interestingly, these publications have contributed\nto diverse sub-fields of Science as their application domains - Fig. 1 (middle). In Fig 1, we also show\nthe Scopus article-type distribution against the query “multimodal action recognition\" to provide\nan overview of the publication trends in this highly active research direction.\nDue to the emerging popularity of the topic, several survey articles have examined MHAR from\ndifferent perspectives [2, 4, 8, 20, 41, 104, 118, 134, 136, 151, 152, 154–156]. However, this article\nis distinct from all previous studies, as we specifically focus and extensively cover the area of\nmultimodal fusion and learning in action recognition. To the best of our knowledge, no prior\ndetailed review article has thoroughly addressed this research direction. The specific contributions\nof this survey are summarized as follows.\n•To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of MHAR methods from\nthe perspective of multimodality, with a focus on CNNs and transformer-based techniques.\n•It provides a thorough review of fusion approaches beyond the typical early and late splits\nused in the implementation of multimodal action recognition.\n•It provides a comprehensive comparison of the existing methods and their performance on\nbenchmark datasets, along with insightful discussions.\n•It pays special attention to the more recent approaches for MHAR, thereby providing readers\nwith an accessible overview of the current state-of-the-art in MHAR.\nThe article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses multimodal learning methods, covering the\noriginal CNN and Transformer architectures and their derivatives. Section 3 summarizes standard\nbenchmark datasets and their state-of-the-art. Fusion mechanisms in multimodal action recognition\nare explored in Section 4, highlighting recent advancements in various fusion strategies. Section 5\naddresses the challenges in current multimodal action recognition. Section 6 concludes the article.\n2 MULTIMODAL LEARNING METHODS\n2.1 Multimodal Learning\nBefore discussing multimodal learning, we must first understand unimodal learning, where a neural\nnetwork processes a single data type.\n3\nACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY Shaikh and Chai, et al.\nGiven a dataset 𝑇 = {𝑥1,...,𝑥 𝑛,𝑦1,...,𝑦 𝑛}, 𝑥𝑖 is the i-th training example and 𝑦𝑖 is the true label of\n𝑥𝑖. Training on a single modality, say RGB images, can be formalized by the equation:\n𝐿(𝐶(𝜙𝑚(𝑋)),𝑦) (1)\nwhere 𝜙𝑚 is a deep neural network tailored for that modality (like a CNN for images). Its parameters\nare represented by ⊖𝑚. 𝐶is a classifier that predicts the label based on the features extracted by𝜙𝑚.\nThis classifier typically uses one or more fully connected layers, and its parameters are denoted by\n⊖𝑐.\nWhen dealing with real-world problems, often a single data modality is not enough. For example,\nin video understanding tasks, both video frames (RGB) and audio can provide valuable information.\nBy leveraging multiple modalities, a model can potentially achieve better performance than relying\non a single one. A typical multimodal fusion-based system would follow a standard workflow (see\nFig. 2).\nTraining with multiple modalities can be formalized as:\n𝐿multi = 𝐿(𝐶(𝜙audio ⊕𝜙video),𝑦) (2)\nhere, each modality, audio and video, has its respective deep neural network, 𝜙audio and 𝜙video,\ndesigned to extract relevant features. The fusion operation, represented by ⊕, can be a simple\nconcatenation, or more sophisticated operations like weighted sums or attention mechanisms.\n2.2 Learning Methods in CNNs\n2.2.1 Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs). CNN architectures found in the literature are diverse\nwhile sharing common elements. Primarily, they incorporate convolutional layers, where multiple\nkernels compute various feature maps based on input data. Generating a new feature map involves\nconvolving the input with a learned kernel and applying an activation function to the results. Shared\nkernels, applied across all spatial input locations, produce individual feature maps, simplifying\nmodel complexity and improving trainability. The feature value at a specific location (𝑖,𝑗 )in the\n𝑘-th feature map of the 𝑙-th layer, denoted as 𝑧𝑙\n𝑖,𝑗,𝑘, is given by the equation:\n𝑧𝑙\n𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 = 𝑤𝑙\n𝑘\n𝑇\n𝑥𝑙\n𝑖,𝑗 +𝑏𝑙\n𝑘 (3)\nHere, the shared kernel 𝑤𝑙\n𝑘 generates the feature map 𝑧𝑙\n:,:,𝑘. The activation function 𝑎(·)introduces\ncrucial non-linearities, determining the convolutional feature activation value 𝑎𝑙\n𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 as follows:\n𝑎𝑙\n𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 = 𝑎(𝑧𝑙\n𝑖,𝑗,𝑘) (4)\nThe pooling layer enhances shift-invariance by reducing feature map resolution. For each feature\nmap 𝑎𝑙\n:,:,𝑘, the pooling function, denoted as pool(·), is applied as follows:\n𝑦𝑙\n𝑖,𝑗,𝑘 = pool(𝑎𝑙\n𝑚,𝑛,𝑘),∀(𝑚,𝑛)∈ R𝑖𝑗 (5)\nAfter multiple convolutional and pooling layers, fully connected layers may exist for high-level\nreasoning. The output layer, often employing the softmax operator for classification, serves as the\nfinal layer. CNN parameters, denoted by 𝜃, including weight vectors and bias terms, are optimized\nby minimizing a task-specific loss function. For 𝑁 input-output pairs (𝑥(𝑛),𝑦(𝑛)); 𝑛 ∈[1,𝑁 ], the\nCNN loss is calculated as:\nLmulti = 1\n𝑁\n𝑁∑︁\n𝑛=1\n𝜆(𝜃;𝑦(𝑛),𝑜(𝑛)) (6)\n4\nFrom CNNs to Transformers in Multimodal Human Action Recognition: A Survey ACM Trans.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Multimodal\nHuman Activity Recognition (MHAR) approaches can leverage the potential of automated feature\nlearning, wherein varying modalities inform and interact with each other through concealed\nfeatures. For a comparison of these techniques on benchmark datasets, please refer to Table 1. Some\nsignificant studies are summarized below.\nIslam et al. [51] introduced a Hierarchical Multimodal Attention-based Human Activity Recogni-\ntion Algorithm (HAMLET), which uses a unique feature encoder and a multi-head self-attention\nmechanism for each modality to encode spatio-temporal features. HAMLET employs a multimodal\nself-attention-based fusion architecture, called Multimodal Atention-based Feature Fusion (MAT),\nwhich blends attention-based fused features with the use of sum (extracted unimodal features are\nsummed after applying multimodal attention) and concatenate (in this approach the attended mul-\ntimodal features are concatenated) operations. Action classification is done using a fully connected\nlayer that harnesses the computed multimodal features. Contrastingly, [78] developed an intuitive\nmethodology that blends different modalities using a matrix concatenation operation, transforming\nsignals into an image for classification via a 2D CNN.\nAnother distinctive approach put forth by [26], combines spatial embeddings of RGB images and\n3D poses using an attention mechanism for extracting superior discriminatory spatio-temporal\npatterns. Moreover, [27] has proposed the late fusion of feature vectors from infrared (IR) and\n3D pose modules, classified by a multi-layer perceptron. Notably, [124] introduced an innovative\nmethod using intermediate fusion among RGB and 3D pose information through a Multimodal\nTransfer Module (MMTM). Moreover, [77] suggests a multi-task framework for concurrent 2D and\n3D estimation from still images and HAR from video sequences.\nThe work proposed by [90] used a network architecture search-based approach that applies a\nprogressive algorithm for multi-fusion architecture search and the introduction of new fusion layers.\nThis technique executes an explicit fusion of video and pose modalities via a search algorithm.\n5\nACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY Shaikh and Chai, et al.\nFig. 3. The Transformer, as originally proposed in [125], depicted through visualization [101].\nAlternatively, [25] introduced an approach that utilizes a separable spatio-temporal attention model\nand a pose-driven attention model, late fusing scores by averaging softmax scores.\nThe Evolution of Pose Estimation Maps (PEM), proposed by [71], employs spatial rank pooling to\naggregate the evolution of heatmaps as a body shape evolution image, and body-guided sampling\nfor aggregating the evolution of poses as a body pose evolution image. Complementary features of\nboth images are then probed through CNNs for action classification. Further, [9] has proposed a\nmethod that uses unstructured collections of spatio-temporal glimpses with distributed recurrent\ntracking. Additionally, [103] has presented a deep multimodal feature analysis-based learning\nmachine that applies mixed norms for component regularization and group selection for superior\nclassification performance. Lastly, [ 55] has used a 5-CNN-streams approach, based on Motion\nHistory Image (MHI), Front Depth Motion Maps (DMMs), Side DMM, Top DMM, and Skeleton\nimages, fused at the decision level for action classification.\nThese various approaches offer different methods of fusing multimodal information and capitaliz-\ning on their synergies for improved performance in Human Activity Recognition. They demonstrate\nversatility and innovation in this rapidly advancing field.\n2.3 Learning Methods in Transformers\nWe first introduce Transformers here and then illustrate the major trends seen across all Transformer-\nbased architectures that have also been adopted for action recognition.\n2.3.1 Transformers. Transformers, as introduced by Vaswani et al. [125], have redefined neural\nnetwork architectures, primarily due to their superior capability in capturing long-term sequential\ndata dependencies. The Transformer was first proposed as a remedy to some limitations of sequence\nmodeling architectures, originally designed to deal with whole sequences at once (see Fig. 3),\nallowing parallelization of some operations (as opposed to RNNs, which are sequential in nature),\nand reducing the locality bias of traditional networks (such as CNNs). The key innovation in\ntransformers is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the network to selectively focus on\ndifferent parts of the input sequence based on their relevance to the current task. Different from\n6\nFrom CNNs to Transformers in Multimodal Human Action Recognition: A Survey ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY\nRNNs, which operate sequentially, and traditional networks like CNNs that have a locality bias,\nTransformers treat entire sequences in parallel, a major breakthrough enabled by the self-attention\nmechanism.\nThe essence of the self-attention mechanism is computing three vectors for every input element:\nquery, key, and value. The mechanism assigns weights to each input element based on its query\nvector’s similarity, then derives an output from a weighted sum of the value vectors. Additionally,\nTransformers have other modules such as: Multi-head attention: It focuses on multiple sequence\nparts simultaneously by generating multiple sets of query, key, and value vectors. The outputs are\nthen amalgamated using a linear operation.\nAttention(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉 )= softmax\n\u0012𝑄𝐾𝑇\n√𝑑𝑘\n\u0013\n𝑉 (7)\nMultiHead(𝑄,𝐾,𝑉 )= Concat(ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑1,...,ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑 ℎ)𝑊𝑂 (8)\nwhere\nℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖 = Attention(𝑄𝑊𝑄\n𝑖 ,𝐾𝑊 𝐾\n𝑖 ,𝑉𝑊𝑉\n𝑖 ) (9)\nand 𝑊𝑄\n𝑖 , 𝑊𝐾\n𝑖 , 𝑊𝑉\n𝑖 , and 𝑊𝑂 are the learnable weight matrices. Position-wise feedforward net-\nwork: This module applies individual feedforward networks to every sequence element, which\nenhances the model’s sequential data handling.\nPosition-wise FeedForward(𝑥)= max(0,𝑥𝑊1 +𝑏1)𝑊2 +𝑏2 (10)\nwhere 𝑥, 𝑊1, 𝑊2, 𝑏1, and 𝑏2 are input and learnable parameters.\n2.3.2 Transformers-based Learning Methods. Transformer-based methods have also been explored\nfor multimodal action recognition and have shown promising results. The self-attention mechanism\nof the Transformer allows it to selectively attend to different modalities and capture their temporal\nand spatial relationships, leading to improved performance compared to traditional methods [37].\nAdditionally, the use of cross-modal attention can help the model fuse information from different\nmodalities and improve its overall accuracy [160]. Table. 2 presents summary on architectures of\nsome significant transformer-based works in MHAR and refers to various features like Normal-\nization (Norm.), Activation (Act.), Encoder configuration (Heads/Layers), Efficiency (Aggregation,\nRestriction, and Weight-sharing), Positional-Encoding (PE, with type and strategy), and Backbone\nnetworks.\nInitial methods such as VATNet [39], CBT [137], and ELR [93] set a precedent. Their successes\npaved the way for a surge in transformer-based approaches, revealing a shift from traditional\nCNN methods, which primarily hinged on spatial features. Most methods either use Pre or Post\nnormalization. When paired with activation, GeLU and ReLU seem to be dominant choices. The\nvaried combinations indicate exploration to pinpoint the most efficient configuration.\nThe hierarchy of encoder architecture varies across different methods. While some like Actor-T\n[38] showcase simpler design configurations, others like Video Swin [73] take a deep dive with\nrelatively complex design choices. This reflects the diverse depth of transformer models tailored\nfor action recognition. However, notable methods, such as TimeSformer [ 11], ViViT [7], VATT\n[5], MViT [30], SCT [149], and others, have indicated the inclusion of aggregation, restriction, and\nweight-sharing strategies for achieving computational efficiency in design.\nA majority of the methods, including ViViT [ 7], SCT [149], and VTN [139], adopt positional\nencoding mechanisms, with strategies ranging from Learnt (L) to Fixed (F) and from Absolute (A)\nto Relative (R). This underscores the essential role of temporal awareness in videos. For backbone\nchoices, transformer-based methods for MHAR leverage diverse CNN-based backbones to capture\nspatiotemporal features essential for video understanding. In particular, I3D [ 18] is commonly\n7\nACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY Shaikh and Chai, et al.\nadopted, known for its efficacy in video-related tasks, as seen in models like VATNet [39], LapFormer\n[60], and Actor-T [38]. S3D [141] in CBT [137] efficiently separates spatial and temporal information,\nenhancing video content understanding. ResNet-50, utilized in LapFormer [60], LTT [53], PEMM\n[65], TRX [91], and GroupFormer [67], provides a strong foundation with residual connections,\naddressing the vanishing gradient problem. R(2+1)D [ 122], found in LTT [ 53], STiCA [89], and\nGroupFormer [67], decomposes 3D convolutions for efficient spatiotemporal processing. SlowFast\n[33], employed in PEMM [65] and CATE [116], captures both slow and fast motion features, suitable\nfor varied temporal dynamics. The use of HRNet [132] in Actor-T [38] emphasizes maintaining\nhigh-resolution representations for detailed visual information. Additionally, various methods,\nincluding TimeSformer [11], ViViT [7], FAST [145], VATT [5], MViT [30], SCT [149], CATE [116],\nVideo Swin [73], and VTN [139], employ custom linear layers, showcasing a flexible approach to\nmultimodal feature fusion within the Transformer architecture. Overall, the selection of CNN-based\nbackbones reflects a strategic choice to enhance the ability of the model to recognize human actions\nin diverse multimodal contexts.\nTransformers, despite their successes, struggle with challenges. A scarcity of large-scale multi-\nmodal datasets reduces their performance, making valid comparisons with CNN-based methods\ndifficult. Their intricate architecture necessitates high computational power and memory. This\nunderlines an acute need for streamlined transformer architectures. The success of transformer-\nbased models, driven by their flexibility and depth, has steered the action recognition domain\ninto an experimental phase. Their departures and incorporations from CNN techniques not only\nnotice their distinctive design philosophy but also underline the evolutionary trajectory of video\nunderstanding. However, addressing their inherent challenges remains pivotal for yielding their\nfull potential in real-world scenarios.\n3 DATASETS\nA multitude of datasets have been created to develop and evaluate multimodal human activity\nrecognition (MHAR) methods. In Table 3, a series of benchmark datasets are listed along with their\nattributes such as scale, number of categories and provided modalities. For RGB-based MHAR,\nUCF101 [112], HMDB51 [63], and Kinectis-400 [54] are widely used as benchmark datasets, along\nwith Kinetics-600 [16], Kinetics-700 [17], EPIC-KITCHENS-55 [24], and ActivityNet [29]. Addi-\ntionally, the datasets MSR-DailyActivity3D [131] and Northwestern-UCLA [130] are widely used\nfor depth-based MHAR. Moreover, for MHAR, large benchmark datasets suitable for fusion and\nco-learning of different modalities include NTU RGB+D [102], NTU RGB+D 120 [70], and MMAct\n[61]. The datasets UTD-MHAD [19], and PKU-MMD [69] are also popularly used.\nMHAR datasets are generally created using different sensor perspectives and settings. For in-\nstance, there are single-view action datasets, multi-view action datasets and multi-person/interaction\naction datasets. In the single-view action datasets, a specific single viewpoint is captured. In the\nmulti-view datasets, two or more viewpoints of a single action are captured in the frame sequences.\nIn multi-person/interaction action datasets, action/activity is normally performed between two\nor more people [152]. Additionally, action recognition datasets are normally available in different\nmodalities, namely RGB, depth videos, skeleton joint positions, inertial sensor signals, and IR. These\nmodalities often allow capturing different aspects of information for the same action scenario. As\ncan be seen in Table 3, the datasets also vary considerably in terms of the size and number of classes.\nAs there is no public platform similar to YouTube available for MHAR dataset generation, MHAR\ncurrently lacks large-scale benchmark datasets when compared to video-based action recognition.\nMHAR datasets contain continuous (Con) or segmented (Seg) videos as reported in Table 3. The\ncontinuous video datasets comprise more than one action in a single video or frame sequence. They\nare mainly used for localization, detection, and prediction of actions.

It is one of the earliest sources\nof action data, that covers a variety of actions, including the interaction between two subjects,\nlocomotion with uneven terrains, sports and several other human actions. CMU MoCap is a\nsegmented dataset with 45 classes of action performed on 144 subjects containing 2,235 video\nsamples.

This dataset requires some post-processing to remove the\nbackground. In particular, the right arms and legs are known to be preferred in this dataset for\nperforming several related actions.\nThe MSR-DailyActivity3D dataset [131] is collected by Microsoft and Northwestern University,\nfocusing on daily activities in a living room. A total of 16 actions are performed by ten subjects\nwhile sitting on a sofa or standing close to a sofa. This dataset functions as a good baseline for\nmultimodal video analysis, providing a small number of classes. The dataset provides RGB, depth\nand skeleton data modalities.\nThe Berkeley Multimodal Human Action Database (Berkeley MHAD) [84] is the first dataset to\nbe captured with five different modalities. One optical MoCap system, four multi-view cameras,\ntwo Kinect v1 cameras, six wireless accelerometers, and four microphones are used in the creation\nof this dataset. Berkeley MHAD contains eleven actions performed by seven male and five female\nsubjects, each varying in terms of style and speed. These actions are divided into the categories\nof: (1) full body movement actions, e.g., jumping jacks, throwing; (2) high dynamics in the upper\nextremity actions, e.g., waving hands, clapping hands; and (3) high dynamics in the lower extremity\nactions, e.g., sitting down, standing up. Audio and accelerometer data are two rare modalities in\nthis dataset.\nThe NTU RGB+D 120 [70] dataset, as highlighted in Table 3, is currently one of the largest action\nrecognition datasets in terms of the number of samples per action. It has RGB, depth, skeleton, and IR\nmodalities, captured with Kinect sensor v2. The dataset has more than 114,000 action video samples\nand up to 8 million image frames. The dataset contains 120 classes of daily and health-related actions\nperformed by 106 subjects aged around 10 to 57 years, with different cultural backgrounds. Further,\n10\nFrom CNNs to Transformers in Multimodal Human Action Recognition: A Survey ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY\nit consists of 155 different camera viewpoints. This dataset is a strong candidate for evaluating the\nscalability and multimodal nature of algorithms.\nThe Toyota-Smarthome (Toyota-SH) [25] dataset contains approximately 16,100 unscripted video\nsamples with 31 action classes performed by 16 subjects. This dataset is one of the most recent\naction recognition datasets, with three different scenes and seven camera viewpoints. Toyota-SH\ndataset provides several real-world challenges such as improvisational acting, camera framing,\ncomposite activities, multi-view and the same activity using different objects. A unique feature\nof this dataset is that its actions are performed by subjects who did not receive any information\nregarding how to perform them. This dataset provides RGB, depth and skeleton modalities.\n4 FUSION METHODS\nTo this end, recent works have started to explore different fusing methods to incorporate multi-\nsensory data streams effectively. Compared with typical CNNs, a Transformer is naturally appropri-\nate for multi-stream data fusion because of its nonspecific embedding and dynamically interactive\nattention mechanisms. Multimodal data fusion refers to the mixing of features from data of various\nmodalities. The objective of multimodal data fusion is to achieve better accuracy than a single\nmodality. Data fusion supports diversity, enhancing the uses, advantages and analysis of ways that\ncannot be achieved through a single modality. Merging different modalities, as in [144], have many\nbenefits such as enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, improved confidence, increased robustness and\nreliability, enhanced resolution, better precision and discrimination as well as robustness against\ninterference [3].\nIn the context of MHAR, the choice of formulation depends on data characteristics and specific\ntask requirements, necessitating experimentation and empirical evaluation to identify the most\neffective fusion strategy for a given multimodal dataset. Researchers explore diverse architectures\nand fusion methods to optimize accuracy and robustness in MHAR systems. Fusion techniques\ncan be deployed at different stages in the action recognition process to acquire combinations of\ndistinct information. These fusion approaches depend on the type of data and technique used for\naction recognition. Multimodal data fusion approaches could be classified into classical-machine-\nlearning-based and deep learning-based, where latter can be further divided into CNNs- and\nTransformers-based, according to architectural choices. Various fusion approaches are discussed in\nthe following subsections.\n4.1 Fusion in CNNs\nData fusion in deep-learning-based MHAR techniques can be applied at similar stages as in classical-\nmachine-learning-based approaches. In the context of fusion in MHAR, a common strategy involves\nemploying modality-specific networks, where separate CNNs process each modality independently,\nand their outputs are combined through fully connected layers or other fusion techniques. Ad-\nditionally, for video-based action recognition, 3D CNNs capture spatial and temporal features\nsimultaneously, offering a natural approach to fuse information across space and time for multiple\nmodalities.\nFor video-based multimodal action recognition, the utilization of 3D CNNs, which capture spa-\ntiotemporal information simultaneously, presents an effective approach. This mirrors the approach\noften employed in single-modality video action recognition [62] and provides a natural means of\nfusing information over both space and time.\nTo accommodate heterogeneous modalities, studies have adopted the practice of utilizing separate\nCNNs for each modality [129]. Subsequently, the outputs from these modality-specific networks are\ncombined using fusion layers, often comprising fully connected layers or other fusion techniques.\n11\nACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY Shaikh and Chai, et al.\nthe incorporation of temporal convolution layers [18] directly models the temporal dynamics\nwithin the data. This is critical for recognizing the temporal evolution of actions, a key factor in\naccurate action recognition.\nHowever, depending on the nature of the deep neural network, data-level, feature-level and\ndecision-level, techniques are often referred to as “early” [34], “middle” [99] or “intermediate” [88],\nand “late” fusion. Table 1 presents some common deep-learning-based MHAR methods that use\ndifferent data fusion approaches, which are discussed in the following subsections.\n4.1.1 Early Fusion. The early-fusion approach captures information and combines it at the feature\nlevel [34]. In this case, features from different modality sources are concatenated in initial layers\ninto an aggregated feature, which will then be used by the later layers for classification. As this\naggregated feature consists of many features, it increases the training and classification time.\nHowever, these large aggregates and suitable learning techniques can offer much better recognition\nperformance in the end. In Fig. 4, the initial process of feature fusion is illustrated as an example of\nearly fusion.\n4.1.2 Middle Fusion. The middle-fusion approach merges the features extracted from raw data in\nthe entire neural network so that the higher layers have access to more global information [88, 99].\nA CNN-based operation is performed to compute the weights and extend the connectivity of all\nlayers. Middle-level fusion attempts to exploit the advantages of early and late fusion in a common\nframework.\n4.1.3 Late Fusion. The late-fusion approach indicates a combination of the action information\nat the deepest layers in the network i.e., after the classification. For example, a typical MHAR\nnetwork architecture consists of two separate CNN-based networks with shared parameters up to\nthe last convolution layer. The outputs of the last convolution layer of these two separate network\nstreams are processed to the fully connected layer. This step predicts the final output after fusing\nthe classification scores and considers individual class labels at the score layer [ 105]. Different\ndecision rules are deployed to fuse the scores at this stage. Although late fusion ignores some\ninteractions between modality, it adds more simplicity and flexibility in making final decisions\nwhen one or more modalities is missing. The late fusion approach has been relatively successful in\nmost MHAR architectures. As evident in Fig. 4, the stage of Probability fusion is an example of late\nfusion in deep-learning-based methods.\n4.2 Fusion in Transformers\nTransformer-based techniques are commonly used for multimodal data fusion. On the one hand, the\nfusion process typically involves concatenating input sequences from all modalities, or employing\na form of cross-attention mechanism (as shown in Fig. 5c). Attention mechanisms dynamically\nweigh the importance of features from various modalities, allowing the network to focus on task-\nrelevant information and effectively fuse data. The fusion process can occur at different stages of\nthe architecture, including early, middle, or late stages. In this paper, we discuss both the how and\nwhere aspects of the fusion process in Transformer-based multimodal data fusion techniques.\n4.2.1 Early Fusion. This subsection discusses Early Fusion techniques which involve methods in\nwhich the fusion occurs prior to input being supplied to the encoder.\nEncoder Fusion (EF). Prior to being fed into the encoder, token embeddings from different modal-\nities are concatenated either in a sequence-wise manner as in [66, 72, 115] (refer to Fig. 5a) or in a\nchannel-wise manner as in [31]. The former can be likened to the approach of BERT [28] in dealing\nwith pairs of language sentences. To differentiate the tokens belonging to each modality, [ 115]\n12\nFrom CNNs to Transformers in Multimodal Human Action Recognition: A Survey ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY\nFig. 4. An example of multi-level fusion in deep-learning-based action recognition, where the red dotted lines\nrepresent four integration points corresponding to different multimodal fusion methods examined. For a\nspecific integration point, the network is duplicated for 𝐾 different modalities, concatenate the features at\nthe integration point, and the network after the integration point remain unchanged. (adapted from [74])\n(a)\n (b)\n(c)\n (d)\nFig. 5. Four main types of performing multimodal fusion in Transformers (adapted from [101]).\nseparator tokens are used, akin to the [SEP] token in BERT, which originally indicates the start of a\nnew sentence but here signals that the succeeding tokens are from another modality. However,\nmost video transformers (VTs) indicate the modality of a given token by summing or concate-\nnating learned modality embeddings in a manner similar to the addition of position embeddings.\nEncoder fusion significantly increases the computational cost of the self-attention operation up\nto 𝑂((𝑇1 +...+𝑇𝑚)2),where 𝑀 is the number of modalities and 𝑇𝑚 is the number of tokens in the\n𝑚-th modality. It is also worth noting here that we not only explore how but also where the fusion\nis integrated into the architecture, namely at early, middle, or late stages.\nHierarchical Encoder Fusion (HEF). In multimodal learning, Encoder fusion can be performed\nhierarchically by initially enhancing modality-specific token embeddings on individual encoders,\n13\nACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY Shaikh and Chai, et al.\nconcatenating their outputs, and sending them to a multimodal encoder [65, 87, 114] (see Fig. 5b).\nThis approach enables intra-modal information to be dealt with before modelling the inter-modal\npatterns, which is advantageous when handling modalities that are not closely related or accurately\naligned at the input level. Experimentation is necessary to determine when to do this. Furthermore,\nthe computational cost is lower than that of the previous encoder fusion by a constant factor,\ndepending on the number of layers in both the unimodal and the multimodal encoders. Although\nusing multiple encoders increases the number of parameters, this can be mitigated by weight\nsharing [65].\n4.2.2 Middle Fusion. This subsection discusses Middle Fusion techniques which involve methods\nin which the fusion occurs before combining the outputs of the different encoders.\nCross-Attention Fusion (CAF). In the process of modalities fusion using CA, one modality seeks\ninformation from another modality to provide context (refer to Fig. 5c). This simple idea and\nits flexibility have led to different uses in various studies. In [49, 59], separate encoder-decoders\nare proposed for each modality, and each cross-attends to text embeddings before combining the\noutputs of the different encoders. The study of [52] proposes only one stream that keeps augmenting\na small set of latent embeddings by repeatedly cross-attending to the same very long multimodal\ninput sequence of minimal embeddings. In this case, CA layers are interleaved with SA layers\nthat refine the cross-attended information. [159] proposes a three-stream Transformer, where the\ncentral one cross-attends to the other two, and these, in turn, attend to the embeddings generated\nby their respective opposite previous cross-attentions. In contrast, [14] also uses three streams, one\nper modality. However, the fusion is achieved within a master stream that substitutes its SA by\nasymmetric cross-attention over the other two simultaneously (concatenating both sets of keys\nand values).\nCo-Attention Fusion (CoAF). In contrast to the cross-attention fusion, co-attention involves parallel\naugmentation of the two modalities by attending to each other’s embeddings. In this approach, the\nCA sub-layer in each stream generates the queries from its own embeddings, whereas keys and\nvalues are obtained from the other stream (see Fig. 5d). The ViLBERT model [75] originally proposed\nthis method for images and language, where it has since been adopted by several video-related\nworks [22, 48, 113]. While some works entirely replaced SA with CA [ 22, 113], others retained\nit [48]. In contrast to encoder fusion, co-attention reduces the computational cost to 𝑂((𝑇1𝑇2)2).\nAdditionally, [153] has advocated for co-attending to each other and self-attending to themselves\nas a means of maintaining intra-modal and inter-modal dynamics separately.\n4.2.3 Late Fusion. All the aforementioned strategies for fusing modalities offer various early and\nmiddle fusion options. However, an alternative approach is to perform a late fusion of modalities.\nThis involves running different modalities through parallel encoders and combining their outputs.\nIn classification problems, these outputs could be class score distributions [38], as is typically done\nfor Two-stream ConvNets [109]. Although this strategy may be suboptimal for Transformers, it\nmay still be useful when there is limited training data available. However, late fusion could be\nconsidered by concatenating the augmented aggregation token as proposed by [59].\nThere are two concatenation-based approaches, namely Encoder Fusion (EF) and Hierarchical\nEncoder Fusion (HEF), the former of which concatenates the modalities at an early stage while the\nlatter concatenates them at a middle stage, which is more computationally intensive but eliminates\nthe need to experimentally determine the fusion point. In contrast, CAF and CoAF are based on\ncross-attention mechanisms and are inherently limited to fusing only two modalities. Nonetheless,\nrecent studies have attempted to extend these methods to more than two modalities, as evidenced\nby the cumbersome approach proposed by [159] in their ActBERT model. Compared to EF and HEF,\n14\nFrom CNNs to Transformers in Multimodal Human Action Recognition: A Survey ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY\nboth CAF and CoAF are more efficient, but they still suffer from the issue of identifying the optimal\nfusion point. However, middle fusion may be useful when the input modalities are asynchronous\nor differ in nature.\n5 CHALLENGES, FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND LIMITATIONS\nIn this section of the survey article, we will delve into the potential challenges, future directions\nassociated with the field under discussion and limitations of this survey. By exploring the challenges,\nwe aim to shed light on the hurdles that must be overcome to make further progress. Further, by\ndiscussing future directions, we aim to provide insights into the exciting new avenues for research\nand development that lie ahead. Finally, by acknowledging the limitations of this survey, we aim to\nprovide a balanced and realistic view of its current scope and limitations.\n5.1 Challenges and Future Directions\nFuture of Datasets: Extensive and comprehensive datasets hold significant importance for the\nadvancement of MHAR, particularly for MHAR methods based on deep learning. Several factors,\nsuch as the magnitude, diversity, applicability, and modality type, indicate its quality. Despite\nthe availability of numerous datasets that have significantly progressed the MHAR field, the\ndevelopment of novel benchmark datasets is still necessary to further promote research in this\ndomain. For instance, most existing multimodal datasets have been obtained in controlled settings\nwith voluntary participants performing actions. Consequently, gathering multimodal data from\nuncontrolled environments to establish substantial and challenging benchmarks for enhancing\nMHAR’s practical applications would be beneficial. Moreover, constructing large and complex\ndatasets for recognizing each person’s actions in crowded settings warrants further exploration.\nMultimodal Learning: Earlier discussions have outlined various multimodal learning methods,\nincluding multimodal fusion and cross-modality transfer learning, proposed for MHAR. Multimodal\ndata fusion, which can complement each other, has been shown to enhance MHAR performance\nwhile co-learning can address data deficiencies in certain modalities. Nevertheless, as [135] has\nhighlighted, several challenges impede the effectiveness of many existing multimodal methods,\nsuch as the risk of overfitting. This underscores the need to develop more effective strategies\nfor multimodal fusion and co-learning in MHAR. This challenge requires further exploration\nand innovation to develop advanced techniques for addressing the limitations of the existing\nstate-of-the-art multimodal methods.\nLabelled Data Scarcity in Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Learning: The application\nof supervised learning methods, particularly deep learning-based ones, typically necessitates a\nsubstantial amount of labelled data for model training, which can be expensive to obtain. Conversely,\nunsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques [6, 110, 111] have the potential to utilize\nunlabelled data to train models, thereby mitigating the requirement for extensive labelled datasets.\nSince unlabelled action samples are often more easily collected than labelled ones, unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised MHAR has emerged as a crucial research direction that merits further investigation.\nGeneralization: It is acknowledged that while some works have investigated the generalization\ncapabilities of Transformers, this issue remains open and understudied, particularly in the case of\nVTs. Although some studies have examined the generalization of Transformers in natural language\nprocessing, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization [44] and cross-modal transfer learning\nwith minimal fine-tuning [76], the analysis of the generalization capabilities of VTs is scarce. To\nthe best of our knowledge, only one work has thoroughly investigated the topic of generalization\nin VTs [150].\n15\nACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY Shaikh and Chai, et al.\nSelf-Supervised Approaches: There is a need for further investigation about video self-supervised\ntasks and their applicability to VTs. While contrastive techniques dominate self-supervised ap-\nproaches, there are several untapped possibilities for utilizing self-supervised video tasks on VTs,\nincluding temporal consistency [ 36], interframe predictability [ 42], geometric transformations\n[58] and motion statistics [128]. Additionally, the recent emergence of self-supervised vision tasks\nlike SimCLR [21] and Barlow Twins [148] for images, or BraVE [97] for video, warrants further\nexploration for their application to VTs.\nOnline and Mobile MHAR: While some studies have explored the use of deep MHAR on mobile\ndevices, such as smartphones and watches, they still face significant limitations in online and\nmobile deployment [12, 64]. In these approaches, the model is trained offline on a remote server,\nand the mobile device only employs the trained model, which is neither real-time nor efficient\nfor incremental learning. Two potential solutions to address this challenge are to reduce the\ncommunication cost between mobile and server and to improve the computing ability of mobile\ndevices.\nCollaboration in Deep-Shallow MHAR: High computational requirements of deep models\nare often a bottleneck, rendering them unsuitable for wearable devices. Contrastingly, shallow\nneural networks (NN) and traditional pattern recognition (PR) methods are not able to achieve\nhigh-performance levels. Therefore, a middle ground needs to be found by developing lightweight\ndeep models that can still achieve high-performance levels while being efficient enough to run\non mobile devices. In this regard, the collaborative efforts of deep and shallow models have the\npotential to provide accurate and lightweight MHAR solutions. However, several issues need to be\naddressed, such as how to effectively share parameters between deep and shallow models. Moreover,\nthe existing offline training of deep models hinders real-time execution, necessitating the need for\nonline training approaches that can enhance the adaptability of the model to new environments.\nEffective Transfer Learning: The process of data annotation via transfer learning is executed\nthrough the utilization of labelled data from auxiliary domains [ 127]. Various factors related to\nhuman activity can be leveraged as supplementary information through deep transfer learning.\nThis approach poses several challenges, including the sharing of weights between networks, the\neffective exploitation of knowledge between activity-related domains, and the identification of\nrelevant domains. These issues require resolution in order to facilitate the effective application of\ntransfer learning methodologies.\nHybrid Sensor and Context-Aware MHAR: The comprehensive information obtained from\nhybrid sensors is of considerable utility in discerning fine-grained activities [ 126]. Particular\nemphasis must be placed on the recognition of such activities through the collaborative utilization\nof hybrid sensors. In contrast, context refers to any information that can be employed to describe\nthe circumstances surrounding an entity [1]. Contextual data sources, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,\nand GPS, can provide valuable insight into environmental factors associated with a given activity.\nThe effective exploitation of contextual information can greatly enhance the ability to recognize\nboth user states and specific activities.\nBeyond Activity Recognition: The recognition of activities frequently represents the initial stage\nin a variety of applications. For example, professional skill assessment is necessary for fitness train-\ning, while smart home assistants are indispensable components of healthcare services. Early efforts\nin activity recognition include research on climbing assessment [56]. Recent investigations suggest\nthat leveraging the expertise of crowds can substantially facilitate the task [92]. Crowdsourcing\noffers a means of annotating unlabelled activities by utilizing the collective abilities of a large\ngroup. In addition to passive label acquisition, researchers may also develop more sophisticated\n16\nFrom CNNs to Transformers in Multimodal Human Action Recognition: A Survey ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput. Commun. Appl. ’24, , NY\nand privacy-preserving methodologies to collect valuable labels. As deep learning continues to\nadvance, activity recognition applications can be expanded beyond simple recognition tasks.\n5.2 Limitations\nOur study was limited to research papers published within the last 10 years (2012-2022) and only\nincluded papers in English, potentially excluding some studies in other languages. Only studies\nthat utilized visual data were considered and others, such as those using olfactory, infrared, or\ntactile data, were outside the scope of this research. A potential limitation is publication bias, which\nmay lead to an overestimation of the advantages of using multiple forms of data for analysis. The\nstudies reviewed employed different input methods and evaluated various methods for recognizing\nactions on different datasets, making direct comparison of results difficult. Additionally, not all\narticles provided statistical confidence intervals, making it challenging to compare their findings.\n6 CONCLUSION\nIn this survey, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis and synthesis of the primary advance-\nments and emerging trends in adapting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers\nfor multimodal recognition of human actions. Drawing upon the existing literature, we have de-\nvised a robust taxonomy for CNN and Transformer architectures based on their modality, intended\ntask and overall structure. Furthermore, we have investigated diverse techniques for embedding,\nencoding and fusing different multimodal representations to achieve more accurate recognition of\nhuman actions.\nIn addition, we have provided a comparative analysis of the leading approaches on different\ndatasets and suggested key design modifications necessary for improving their performance.\nMoreover, we have discussed the current trends and potential challenges associated with the\ndifferent components of the multimodal action recognition pipeline. Despite the considerable\nprogress that has been made, the potential of multimodal fusion for action recognition remains\nlargely unexplored, and there remain several significant challenges that need to be addressed.\nFinally, we express a keen interest in comparing Transformer architectures to CNNs for multimodal\nunderstanding, given the tremendous promise of global-based learning methods.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is partially funded by Edith Cowan University (ECU) and the Higher Education Commis-\nsion (HEC) of Pakistan under Project #PM/HRDI-UESTPs/UETs-I/Phase-1/Batch-VI/2018.
