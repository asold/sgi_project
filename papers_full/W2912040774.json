The load increase usually requires the addition of new power plants, both in terms of the number of \nunits and the generated power capacity. Consequently, further addition and expansion of transmission and \ndistribution systems infrastructure are required. T he system becomes more complex and susceptible to \ninterference. Continuity of service must also satisfy technical and economical  requirements. Load changes, \ncomposition of generating units in operation as well as the changes in network configuration have a  great \nimpact on the overall variation of voltage levels and power losses in the system. Voltage profile improvement \nto fulfill the assigned operation standard of the entire system  has some impacts to decrease power loss es in \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  ISSN: 2088-8708  \n \nOptimization of the Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifting Transformer Using PSO Algorithm (Hadi Suyono) \n5473 \nthe system [1 ]-[2]. Voltage fluctuation can also be controlled through power system compensation. The \ncompensation both in transmission and distribution system s can be performed using either conventional \ncapacitor banks or Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices [3]-[6]. The FACTS \ndevices implementations include Static VAR Compensator (SVC)  [7]-[9], Thyristor Controll ed Series \nCapacitor (TCSC) [10], Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifting Transformer (TCPST) [11], Unified Power Flow \nControl (UPFC) [12], Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) [13] and many others [14]. Some research results \nalso showed that the use of distributed generation could overcome the voltage profile problem and power \nlosses in distribution system, and also claimed to improve the distribution system performances in term s of \npower quality [13], reliability [15-16], and stability [17]-[18]. \nThis paper presents the investigation results on the use of combination of two FACTS devices, \nwhich are a TCPST and a TCSC, to overcome the voltage profile problem. The TCSC is specifically used to \ncompensate the reactance of the transmission line and commonly used on long transmission line. The main \nissues explored in the study were the optimal location and sizing for the placement of TCPST -TCSC \ncombination. Comparison to the use of conventional capacitor banks h as been performed to justify. There \nhave been many methods proposed to solve the optimization problem, including the heuristic probabilistic \nand artificial intelligent methods. Genetic Algorithm (AG) method was explored to determine the optimal \nlocation of multi-type FACTS [19] and to control the voltage and reactive power [20]-[21]. There were many \nother artificial intelligent methods such as Artificial Bee Colony algorithm [8] , [22], Simulated Annealing \n[23], Fuzzy EP algorithm [24], and others population  algorithm [25], being studied. In this paper, Particle \nSwarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. However, the PSO \nalgorithm has been used in many applications including the SVC location optimization [26]. PSO algorithm \nis a method adopting the social behavior of birds when flying together in search of food. Performance of the \nPSO algorithm to control the voltage profile and power losses have been tested on the 30 -bus system IEEE \nstandard data. \n \n \n2. POWER SYSTEM COMPENSATION \n2.1. Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifting Transformer (TCPST) \nTCPST is a  device with characteristics similar to conventional Phase Angle Regulators (PAR) , \nbeing connected in series to network. The main difference lies in the fact that the tap changer is control led \nusing thyristor to achieve faster operation [14]. The voltage on the primary side is injected thus the phase \nshifted, and therefore the transmission angle can be controlled. The modeling of power injection at the ith and \njth buses is shown in Figure 1. \n \n \nPsi + jQsi Psj + jQsj\n \n \nFigure 1.

The voltage phase -angle \nwhich can be controlled by TCPST is in the range between -5° and 5°.

Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC) \nTCSC is one type of FACTS devices which combines a Thyristor Controlled Reactor (TCR) with \ncapacitor [14]. The TCR consists of inductor being connected in series with thyristor. TCSC is capable to \nadjust reactance of transmission line by controlling the thyristor firing -angle. Figure 3 represents a simple \nmodeling of series TCSC. To avoid over compensation, the inj ection of TCSC is set on 20% inductive \n(0.2Xline) up to 70% capacitive (-0.7Xline) of the line reactance [28], such that: \n \nrTCSCmin=-0.7 and rTCSCmax=0.2  (5) \n \n \ni\nXc Rij +jXij\nTCSC\nj\n \n \nFigure 3.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nIn this study, the proposed solution has been simulated and tested using 30-bus system IEEE \nstandard data. The results of the power flow analysis have been obtained from some scenarios including the \nconditions without any injection of compensation, the condition with injection of optimum capacitor bank \ncompensation, and the condition with injection of optimum TCPST-TCSC compensation. The PSO algorithm \nimplementation to determine the optimum location and sizing of the compensation using the TCPST -TCSC \ncombination has been compared to that using capacitor bank. In addition, the PSO algorithm performance has \nalso been compared with the implementation of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm [8]. \n \n4.1. IEEE 30 Bus System Data \nThe performance of the PSO algorithm has been tested using the 30 -bus system IEEE standard data \nas follows: Bus Nu mber: 30, Slack bus: Bus no#1, Generator: Bus no# 2, 5, 8, 11, and 13, Total demand: \n201.43 MW and 137.80 MVAR. The PSO algorithm will determine the best location and sizing of the \nreactive power required in the system by performing the load flow analysis for each iteration. There are four \n\nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  ISSN: 2088-8708  \n \nOptimization of the Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifting Transformer Using PSO Algorithm (Hadi Suyono) \n5477 \n(4) cases of the system that will be performed to show the performance of the PSO algorithm and the \nimplemented of the compensator devices i.e.:  \n- Case#1: without any injection of compensation,  \n- Case#2: with injection of capacitor bank compensation \n- Case#3: with injection TCPST-TCSC compensation \n- Case#4: with injection SVC compensation by using another optimization method i.e. Artificial Bee \nColony (ABC) Algorithm [8]. \nFor Case#2 and #3, the load flow analyses have been perfo rmed after the determination of optimum \nlocation and capacity of reactive power compensation required in the system using the PSO algorithm. In \naddition, the PSO Algorithm is also compared with ABC algorithm as given in Case#4.  \n \n4.2. Results of Case#1: without any injection of compensation \nIn this analysis, the 30 -bus IEEE system has been tested under the condition without any \ncompensating device. Based on the load flow analysis, the power flow as well as power losses on each \nbranch, and the voltage on each sys tem bus could be determined. Newton Raphson algorithm has been \nadopted to solve the load flow problem based on the following parameters: base power =100 MVA, \naccuracy=0.00001, and maximum iteration number =20. The results of load flow analysis for this case is \nshown in Table 2. \nBased on Table 2, total active and reactive power generated were around 205.489 MW and 118.401 \nMVAR respectively. In addition, the total active and reactive power losses in the system were approximately \n4.061 MW and -19.399 MVAR. There  were three buses experiencing under voltage problem, being lower \nthan the allowable minimum voltage, i.e. 0.95 p.u. The buses with voltage level beyond the limits occurred \non bus# 18, bus#19, and bus#20. The percentage of the active power losses is about 2.02% with respect to the \nactive power load. \n \n \nTable 2.

The same simulation using IEEE 30-bus system as a base-case data have \nbeen made and compared in terms of voltage profile and the best active power loss reached. Based on the \nABC algorithm result shows that the number of SVCs required in the system was two (2) locations with \ncapacity values 36.996 MVAR at bus#5 and 36.971 MVAR at bus#19 respectively.  \nThe simulation results of the system after the placement of SVC for the most minimum power loss \nis shown in Table 7. It can be seen that the total power generated by the generator was equal to 204.21 MW \nand 48.40 MVAR for active power and reactive power. The total active and reactive power losses obtained \nfor this case were 2.7927 MW and -15.2076 MVAR respectively.

Comparison results between cases \nThe results of system simulation on IEEE 30 -bus system with four cases have been compared in \nterms of voltage profile and the best active power loss reached for each case by using the PSO algorithm and \nABC algorithm [8]. Figure 8 shows the voltage profiles  comparison. The worst voltage profile has been \nexperienced in Case#1 where the availability of the reactive power was very limited depending on the \ngenerating unit. There are three buses were below the allowable minimum voltage of 0.95 p.u. \nHowever, the s upply of the reactive power depended on the output of the active power loading for \neach unit. On the other hand, the voltage profiles have been improved in Case#2 and Case#3 by using PSO \nalgorithm and Case#4 by using ABC algorithm, since the reactive power  sources have been implemented to \nsupport the deficiency of the reactive power. All of the buses voltage was above 0.95 p.u., since the reactive \npower compensations required in the system were satisfied using capacitor bank for Case#2, TCSC -TCPST \nfor Case#3, and SVC for Case#4. The Case#3 showed a better voltage profile compared to the other cases.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8.

The percentage of active \npower losses referred to the total active power load is given  in the table. The implementation of the capacitor \nbanks and the TCSC -TCPST combination which had been optimized using the PSO algorithm could reduce \nthe active power losses as much as 1.707 MW (42.03%) and 1.887 MW (46.47%) respectively, being \ncompared to  the condition without any injection of the compensation (Case#1). In addition, the \nimplementation of the SVC compensation by using the ABC algorithm could also reduce the active power \nlosses as much as 1.887 MW (31.23%) with respect to the Case#1. However , the implementation of the \nTCSC-TCPST compensation with PSO algorithm gave a slightly better result than using the capacitor bank \nwith PSO algorithm and SVC with ABC algorithm [8]. \n \n \n5.  CONCLUSION \nThe Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm has been explored to determine the optimum \nlocation and sizing of capacitor banks and TCPST -TCSC combination with the aim to improve the voltage \nprofile and to reduce the power losses of the system. It has been proven that the algorithm performed well \nand required small iterations number, i.e. 5 -14 iterations, in determining the optimum values. The 30 -bus \nsystem IEEE standard was tested to show the performance of the PSO algorithm. The optimum placement \nand sizing of capacitor bank and TCPST -TCSC combination on the transmission lines using the PSO \nalgorithm have been proven to be able to improve the bus voltage bus values within the allowable voltage \nlimits. The result also showed that the implementation of optimum TCPST -TCSC placement was more \neffective than the opt imum placement of capacitor banks in reducing power losses of the system, giving a \nreduction of 46.47% and 42.03% using TCPST -TCSC combination and capacitor bank respectively. The \nperformance of PSO algorithm also have been compared with the ABC algorithm. The implementation of the \nTCSC-TCPST compensation with PSO algorithm gave a slightly better result than using the capacitor bank \nwith PSO algorithm and SVC with the ABC algorithm. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \nWe are grateful to the Institute of Research and Community Service of Brawijaya University for the \nfunding of the research the results of which are presented in this publication and for the Power System \nEngineering and Energy Management Research Group (Pse eMRG), Faculty of Engineering, Brawijaya \nUniversity, for the funding of this publication. \n \n \nREFERENCES  \n[1] V.
