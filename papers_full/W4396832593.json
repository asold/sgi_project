    "abstract": "Growth mindset, the belief in enhancing abilities through effort and dedication, is commonly applied in classroom learning. The Mindset Theory Scale suggests it can be measured by \"effort\" and \"belief in improvement\", while fixed mindset is indicated by \"procrastination\" and \"immutability of belief\". In today's interconnected world, the need for proficiency in multiple languages has grown. However, mastering different languages poses several challenges, including motivational challenges and fear of failure. To address this issue, our study explores the use of an adaptable Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbot to foster growth mindset and aid in language learning. In a user study with this novel chatbot system, we evaluated the impact of a growth mindset teaching style on new language learning and user perception. Our initial findings show that users are more comfortable, confident, and interested in interacting with the growth mindset chatbot compared to the fixed mindset chatbot.",
