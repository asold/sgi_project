INTRODUCTION\nElectronic power transformer (EPT), also called solid-state\ntransformer (SST) [1], or power electronic transformer\n(PET) [2], has been considered as a key component for the\nfuture power grid. It has many advanced features, such as\nrenewable energy integration, main power grid and AC/DC\nmicrogrid connection [3], [4], output voltage regulation, har-\nmonic suppression, reactive power compensation and fault\nisolation.\nFor the three-stage EPT in the high-voltage high-power\napplications, there are several promising topologies which\nhave been researched, such as the cascaded H-bridge\nEPT [5]–[8], the modular multilevel converter (MMC)\nEPT [9], [10] and the clamping multilevel EPT [11], [12].\nIn 2012, a 15-kV 1.2-MV A single-phase cascaded H-bridge\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Alfeu J. Sguarezi Filho.\ntraction EPT was installed on a locomotive to reduce vol-\nume and improve efﬁciency by replacing the 16.67 Hz lin-\near power transformer [13], [14]. In 2015, a 10-kV/400-V\n500-kV A three-phase cascaded H-bridge EPT was installed\nin a distribution power grid to provide high quality power\nsupply [8].\nFor the three-phase cascaded H-bridge EPT, there are gen-\nerally three types of topologies depending on the connections\nof the low-voltage DC-links, which are the common DC-link\ntopology (low-voltage DC-links in three phases are connected\nat one common link) [15]–[17], the partial common DC-link\ntopology (low-voltage DC-links in each phase are connected\nat one common link, and three common links are sepa-\nrated) [18], [19] and the separated DC-link topology (low-\nvoltage DC-links in three phases are separated) [8], [20], [21].\nAmong three types of cascaded H-bridge EPTs, one\nof advantages of the separated DC-link topology may be\nits modular structure, which is beneﬁcial for high-voltage\n38558\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Tianet al.: Individual DC Voltage Balance Control for Cascaded H-Bridge EPT\nhigh-power applications. In [8], a voltage source con-\nverter (VSC) in the input stage and a front-end VSC in the\nisolation stage are packed together as a high-voltage power\ncell (HVPC). A back-end VSC in the isolation stage and a\nVSC in the output stage are packed together as a low-voltage\npower cell (LVPC). A power module (PM) is assembled by\na HVPC, a medium-frequency isolation transformer (MFIT)\nand a LVPC. These PMs can be easily cascaded or paralleled,\nwhich is beneﬁcial for implementation, maintenance and\nextension. Hence, the separated DC-link topology is chosen\nas the study object in this paper.\nWhen EPT is employed in the distribution power grid,\nthere is a realistic demand to provide DC ports for renewable\nenergy sources (e.g., small photovoltaic or wind generators)\nand DC loads (e.g., charging piles for electric vehicles),\nwhile providing high quality AC power for consumers. When\nrenewable energy sources or DC loads are connected with\nsome DC ports of EPT, the power unbalance will occur\namong different PMs. The power unbalance also occurs under\ncomponent parameter mismatch conditions (differences in\nswitching losses, leakage inductances of MFITs, turn ratios\nof MFITs, output ﬁltering impedances and so on). The power\nunbalance will cause DC voltage unbalance, and the unbal-\nanced DC voltages will degrade the performance of EPT and\nmay trigger the DC voltage protection.\nFor EPT with the separated DC-link topology, several\nliteratures have researched the individual unbalanced DC\nvoltage issue. In [20] and [21], an overall individual DC volt-\nage balance strategy has been proposed to balance high-\nvoltage and low-voltage DC-links by adjusting active powers\nin the input and isolation stages. The strategy works well\nunder slight unbalanced conditions (slight component param-\neter mismatches or the proportion of DC power (provided/\nconsumed by DC ports) in the total power (DC and AC\npower) is small). However, the individual dc voltage balance\ncapacity of this strategy is quite limited, since the maximum\nallowed adjusted active power in the cascaded H-bridges is\nrelatively small [22]. Under severe unbalanced conditions\n(severe component parameter mismatches or the proportion\nof DC power is out of limits), the individual DC-links will be\nunbalanced. Even though a current sharing control strategy is\nemployed in the output stage to eliminate the negative effects\nof component parameter mismatches, the control strategies\nremain unhelpful when DC power occupies a large proportion\nin the total power. In [8], [23], and [24], low-voltage DC-links\nare feedback to control the input stage of EPT with an open-\nloop controller in the isolation stage. Individual low-voltage\nDC-link is balanced by adjusting active powers in the out-\nput stage. The low-voltage DC-links can be balanced under\nsevere unbalanced conditions, but the high-voltage DC-links\nwill be unbalanced and vary with different unbalanced con-\nditions. Also, the control strategies bring reactive circulating\ncurrents in the output stage, which increase the current burden\nand power losses of the paralleled inverters. For EPT with\ncommon and partial common DC-link topologies, the indi-\nvidual high-voltage DC-link is balanced by adjusting the\nactive power ﬂowing through the input stage [22] or the isola-\ntion stage [25]. Since these two topologies are not concerned\nin this paper, the individual DC voltage balance issue for\nthese two topologies will not be further discussed. In the\nabove analysis, the high-voltage and low-voltage DC-link\nbalance capabilities of existing individual DC voltage balance\nstrategies for EPT with the separated DC-link need to be\nimproved under severe unbalanced conditions.\nIn this paper, an overall individual DC voltage balance\nstrategy for EPT with the separated DC-link topology is\nproposed. The high-voltage and low-voltage DC-links can\nbe well balanced even under severe unbalanced conditions.\nThe proposed strategy will be analyzed and supported by\nexperimental validation in the rest of this paper.\nFIGURE 1. The main circuit configuration of the three-phase EPT with the\nseparated DC-link topology.\nII. EPT WITH SEPARATED DC-LINK TOPOLOGY\nFig. 1 shows the main circuit of the three-phase EPT with\nthe separated DC-link topology presented in [8]. It is a three-\nstage input-series-output-parallel conﬁguration with n PMs\nper phase. The three stages are the input stage, the isolation\nstage and the output stage. In Fig. 1, there are two AC ports\nand six DC ports. For the PM 1 in each phase, there are a\nhigh-voltage DC port and a low-voltage DC port to connect\nrenewable energy sources and DC loads with different voltage\nlevels.\nIII. THE PROPOSED OVERALL INDIVIDUAL\nDC VOLTAGE BALANCE STRATEGY\nWhen renewable energy sources and DC loads are connected\nwith the DC ports of EPT (e.g., DC ports A_H and A_L,\nshown in Fig. 1) or component parameter mismatch occurs,\nthere will be power unbalance among different PMs. If the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 38559\nJ. Tianet al.: Individual DC Voltage Balance Control for Cascaded H-Bridge EPT\nFIGURE 2. Power flows of the PM which contains the DC ports.\npower unbalance is beyond the adjustment capability of the\nDC voltage balance controller, DC voltages will be unbal-\nanced. In this section, the renewable energy source and DC\nload scenario will be analyzed as an example. Fig. 2 shows\nthe power ﬂows of the PM which contains the DC ports. For\nthe high-voltage DC-link, the DC voltage will be maintained\nat the average value when\nPH_in =Piso +PDC_H , (1)\nwhere PH_in and Piso are the active powers ﬂowing through\nthe input stage and isolation stage, respectively. PDC_H is\nthe DC power provided/consumed by the high-voltage DC\nport. From (1), it can be seen there are two approaches for\nthe high-voltage DC-link to maintain the average value when\nPDC_H changes, one approach is adjusting PH_in and the other\nis adjusting Piso. For the low-voltage DC-link, there are also\ntwo approaches to maintain the average value, one approach\nis adjusting Piso and the other is adjusting PL_out , where is the\nactive power ﬂowing through the output stage.\nCombining the high-voltage and low-voltage DC-link bal-\nance approaches together, there are generally three overall\nindividual DC voltage balance strategies.\nStrategy 1: Balancing individual high-voltage DC-link by\nadjusting individual PH_in ﬂowing through the input stage\nand balancing individual low-voltage DC-link by adjusting\nindividual Piso ﬂowing through the isolation stage. This strat-\negy has been presented in [20] and [21].\nStrategy 2: Balancing individual high-voltage DC-link by\nadjusting individual PH_in ﬂowing through the input stage\nand balancing individual low-voltage DC-link by adjusting\nindividual PL_out ﬂowing through the output stage.\nThe proposed strategy: balancing individual high-voltage\nDC-link by adjusting individual Piso ﬂowing through the\nisolation stage and balancing individual low-voltage DC-link\nby adjusting individual PL_out ﬂowing through the output\nstage.\nThese three overall individual DC voltage balance strate-\ngies contain three active power adjustment approaches, and\nthe maximum adjusted active power for each approach will\nbe carried out in this section.\nA. ADJUSTING PH_in IN THE INPUT STAGE\nIn the input stage, there are n cascaded H-bridges per phase.\nIt is assumed that the input stage of EPT is in the unity\npower factor state. es is the input phase-to-neutral voltage,\nis is the input current, vj is the AC side voltage of the jth(j ∈\n{1,..., n}) H-bridge. Deﬁning es =\n√\n2 Es̸ 0, is =\n√\n2 Is̸ 0\nand vj =\n√\n2 Vdj +j\n√\n2 Vqj, and the active power of the jth\nH-bridge can be expressed as\nPH_in_ j =VdjIs. (2)\nPtotal_in is deﬁned as the total active power ﬂowing through\nthe input stage per phase, and it can be expressed as\nPtotal_in =EsIs. (3)\nIn order to operate the jth H-bridge in the linear range,⏐⏐vj\n⏐⏐should be less than or equal to Vdc_H , where Vdc_H is the\nrated value of the high-voltage DC-link. Assuming Vqj equals\nzero, then Vdj ≤Vdc_H /\n√\n2. From (2) and (3), we can get\nPH_in_ j\nPtotal_in\n=Vdj\nEs\n≤Vdc_H√\n2Es\n. (4)\nWhen the jth H-bridge is in the linear operation range, the\nmaximum adjusted active power is\nPadj_in =Vdc_H Ptotal_in/\n(√\n2Es\n)\n−Ptotal_in/n. (5)\nSince\n√\n2 Es ≈minnVdc_H , Padj_in can be expressed as\nPadj_in ≈Ptotal_in/(minn) −Ptotal_in/n, (6)\nwhere min is the modulation ratio of the rectiﬁer in the\ninput stage. Usually, 0 .7 ≤ min ≤ 1 ( min ≥ 0.7 is to\nimprove the utilization of the DC capacitor.). The max-\nimum allowed power of each H-bridge is set at 1 .2 ∗\nPrated for design and operation redundancy considerations.\nWhen Vdc_H Ptotal_in/\n(√\n2 Es\n)\nis bigger than1 .2 ∗Prated ,\nVdc_H Ptotal_in/\n(√\n2 Es\n)\nwill be limited at 1 .2 ∗Prated . Under\nthis condition, the Padj_in can be expressed as\nPadj_in =1.2 ∗Prated −Ptotal_in/n, (7)\nB. ADJUSTING Piso IN THE ISOLATION STAGE\nIn the isolation stage, there are n dual active bridges (DABs),\nwhich are independent to each other. For the jth DAB, the\nphase-shift control strategy is employed. The transferred\nactive power can be expressed as (presented in [20])\nPiso_ j =mVdc_H Vdc_L\n2πfsls\nϕj\n(\n1 −\n⏐⏐ϕj\n⏐⏐\nπ\n)\n. (8)\nIn (8), m and ls are the turn ratio and leakage inductance\nof the MFIT, respectively. fs is the switching frequency and\nϕj is the phase-shift angle between two H-bridges. For the\njth DAB, when ϕj reaches π/2, the maximum transferred\nactive power is\nmax(Piso_ j) =mVdc_H Vdc_L /(8fsLs). (9)\nPrated is deﬁned as the rated power of each PM, and\nPtotal_iso is deﬁned as the total active power ﬂowing though\nthe isolation stage per phase. Since max( Piso_ j) is far\nbeyond Prated , the value of max(Piso_ j) is limited at 1 .2∗Prated\n38560 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. Tianet al.: Individual DC Voltage Balance Control for Cascaded H-Bridge EPT\nfor design and operation redundancy considerations. Hence,\nwhen the ﬂowing directions of Piso_ j and Ptotal_iso are the\nsame, the maximum adjusted active power of the jth DAB\nreaches\nPadj_iso =1.2 ∗Prated −Ptotal_iso/n. (10)\nWhen the ﬂowing directions of Piso_ j and Ptotal_iso are\nopposite, the maximum adjusted active power of the jth DAB\nreaches\nPadj_iso =1.2 ∗Prated +Ptotal_iso/n. (11)\nFIGURE 3. The phasor diagram of output voltages and currents under a\nsevere unbalanced output active power condition.\nC. ADJUSTING PL_out IN THE OUTPUT STAGE\nTo simplify the analysis, several restricts are employed:\n1) The AC power is resistive, and the currents of ﬁltering\ncapacitors are ignored.\n2) The impedances of ﬁltering inductors are equal.\n3) There are no reactive circulating currents.\nFig. 3 shows the phasor diagram of output voltages and\ncurrents under a severe unbalanced output active power con-\ndition. v1,..., vn and i1,..., in are output voltages and cur-\nrents of paralleled inverters. zL is the impedance of each\nﬁltering inductor. uo and io the voltage and current of the\nAC load. In Fig. 3, vj is ahead of uo to provide active power,\nand v1,..., vj−1,vj+1,..., vn lag behind uo to absorb active\npower. Since there are no reactive power circulating cur-\nrents, ij is in phase with uo, and i1,..., ij−1,ij+1,..., in are\nopposite to uo.\nDeﬁning uo =\n√\n2 Uo̸ 0, vj =\n√\n2 Vj̸ αj, ij =\n√\n2 Ij̸ 0\nand zL =ZL ̸ θ. The RMS value of the output current of the\njth inverter is\nIj =\n(√\nV 2\nj −U2o sin2 θ−Uo cos θ\n)\n/ZL (12)\nThe active power transferred by the jth inverter is\nPL_out_ j =Uo\n(√\nV 2\nj −U2o sin2 θ−Uo cos θ\n)\n/ZL\n+\n(√\nV 2\nj −U2o sin2 θ−Uo cos θ\n)2\ncos θ/ZL .\n(13)\nTo operate the jth paralleled H-bridge in the linear range,\nVj should be less than or equal to Vdc_L /\n√\n2, where Vdc_L is\nthe rated value of the low-voltage DC-link. When Vj reaches\nits maximum value, the maximum output active power is\nmax(PL_out_ j)\n=Uo\n\n\n√\nV 2\ndc_L\n2 −U2o sin2 θ−Uo cos θ\n\n/ZL\n+\n\n\n√\nV 2\ndc_L\n2 −U2o sin2 θ−Uo cos θ\n\n\n2\ncos θ/ZL . (14)\nSince max( PL_out_ j) is far beyond Prated , the value of\nmax(PL_out_ j) is limited at 1 .2 ∗Prated . Ptotal_out is deﬁned\nas the total active power ﬂowing through the output stage per\nphase. Hence, when the ﬂowing directions of PL_out_ j and\nPtotal_out are the same, the maximum adjusted active power\nof the jth inverter reaches\nPadj_out =1.2 ∗Prated −Ptotal_out /n. (15)\nWhen the ﬂowing directions of PL_out_ j and Ptotal_out\nare opposite, the maximum adjusted active power of the jth\ninverter reaches\nPadj_out =1.2 ∗Prated +Ptotal_out /n. (16)\nFIGURE 4. The values ofPadj_in, Padj_iso and Padj_out under different\nload conditions.\nD. DC VOLTAGE BALANCE CAPABILITY COMPARISONS\nOF THREE OVERALL INDIVIDUAL DC VOLTAGE\nBALANCE STRATEGIES\nThe values of Padj_in, Padj_iso and Padj_out under different load\nconditions are shown in Fig. 4. It is assumed that the ﬂow\ndirections of PH_in_ j, Piso_ j, PL_out_ j, Ptotal_in, Ptotal_iso and\nPtotal_out are the same. Also, it is assumed that min =0.85\nand Ptotal_in =Ptotal_iso =Ptotal_out . From Fig. 4, it can be\nseen that the values of Padj_iso and Padj_out are much bigger\nthan that of Padj_in in almost all the load conditions.\nThe DC voltage balance capabilities of three overall\nindividual DC voltage balance strategies depend on the\nactive powers adjusted by the controllers. The more adjusted\nVOLUME 7, 2019 38561\nJ. Tianet al.: Individual DC Voltage Balance Control for Cascaded H-Bridge EPT\nTABLE 1.

For the\nproposed strategy, the required adjusted active power of the\nisolation stage comes from the output stage. Hence, the max-\nimum value of the adjusted active power for the high-voltage\nDC-link balance controller is limited at the smaller value\nbetween Padj_out and Padj_iso.\nSince the values of Padj_iso and Padj_out are much bigger\nthan that of Padj_in in almost all the load conditions, the DC\nvoltage balance capabilities of three overall individual DC\nvoltage balance strategies can be ranked as: the proposed\nstrategy >strategy 2 >strategy 1. From the analysis, it is\nalso can been seen that the proposed strategy has the biggest\nDC voltage balance capability by avoiding adjusting active\npower in the cascaded H-bridges.\nIV. REALIZATION OF THE PROPOSED OVERALL\nINDIVIDUAL DC VOLTAGE BALANCE STRATEGY\nThe proposed strategy contains two parts: an individual high-\nvoltage DC-link balance strategy in the isolation stage and an\nindividual low-voltage DC-link balance strategy in the output\nstage.\nA. REALIZATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL HIGH-VOLTAGE\nDC-LINK BALANCE STRATEGY\nIn the isolation stage, each DAB is controlled by the phase-\nshift strategy described in [20], the equivalent circuit of the\nisolation stage referred to the high-voltage side is shown\nin Fig. 5(a). Fig. 5(b) shows the individual high-voltage\nDC-link balance controller. Vdc_L and Vdc_H are the aver-\nage values of the low-voltage and high-voltage DC-links,\nrespectively. V ∗\ndc_L is the reference value of the low-voltage\nDC-links.\nFIGURE 5. The control of the isolation stage per phase. (a) The isolation\nstage referred to the high-voltage side. (b) The individual high-voltage\nDC-link balance controller.\nFIGURE 6. The control diagram of the individual low-voltage DC-link\nbalance strategy per phase.\nB. REALIZATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL LOW-VOLTAGE\nDC-LINK BALANCE STRATEGY\nFig. 6 shows the control diagram of the individual low-voltage\ndc-link balance strategy. The strategy has three controllers:\nan AC output voltage controller, a DC-link balance con-\ntroller and a reactive current balance controller.

In Fig. 7,\nthe q-axis and d-axis components of 1v are adjusted by\nthe DC-link and reactive current balance controllers to force\n1v to be in phase with z. Hence, this strategy won’t bring\nreactive circulating currents. Although the analysis is carried\nout under the condition that impedances of ﬁltering inductors\nare equal, however, the closed-loop controllers can guarantee\nthere won’t be reactive circulating currents under unequal\nimpedance conditions.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nIn order to verify the performance of the proposed strategy, a\nthree-phase 380-V/ 47-V 4 kV A EPT experimental prototype\nis established. The main circuit of the prototype is the same\nas that shown in Fig. 1. The parameters are shown in Table 2,\nand the experimental prototype is shown in Fig. 8.\nCase 1: The AC port of the output stage is connected with\nan 1 resistor per phase.\nFig. 9(a) shows three-phase phase-to-phase input volt-\nages eab, ebc and eca, three-phase input currents isa, isb\nand isc, three-phase output phase-to-neutral voltages uoan,\nuobn and uocn, and three-phase output currents ioa, iob and ioc.\nFig. 9(b) shows internal voltages and currents of phase c.\nFIGURE 8.

Output voltage and currents of phase c with the individual\nlow-voltage DC-link balance strategy under case 4. (a) The dynamic\nwaveforms. (b) The steady-state waveforms.\nFor the low-voltage DC port, the DC power consumed by\nthis DC port is 469 W, and the AC power consumed by the\nAC load is 92 W. The comparisons of three strategies under\ncase 2 can been seen in Table 3.\nFor strategy 1, it can be seen that the maximum allowed\nadjusted active power of the low-voltage DC-link balance\ncontroller is much smaller than the required value. This will\nlead to unbalanced low-voltage DC-links. For the proposed\nstrategy and strategy 2, it can be seen that the maximum\nallowed adjusted active power of the low-voltage DC-link\nbalance controller is bigger than the required value. This\ncan guarantee the balance of the low-voltage DC-links.\nThe conclusions are also supported by the waveforms\nin Fig. 10.\nCase 3: The AC port of the output stage is connected with\nan 8 resistor per phase. At t1, a 32 resistor is connected\nwith the DC port C_H as a DC load.\nFor the high-voltage DC port, the DC power consumed by\nthis DC port is 488 W, and the AC power consumed by the\nAC load is 92 W. The comparisons of three strategies under\ncase 3 can been seen in Table 4.\nFor strategy 1 and strategy 2, it can be seen that the\nmaximum allowed adjusted active power of the high-voltage\nDC-link balance controller is much smaller than the required\nvalue. This will lead to unbalanced high-voltage DC-links.\nFor the proposed strategy, it can be seen that the maximum\nallowed adjusted active power of the high-voltage DC-link\nbalance controller is bigger than the required value. This\ncan guarantee the balance of the high-voltage DC-links. The\nconclusions are also supported by the waveforms in Fig. 11.\nFrom Fig. 10 and Fig. 11, it can be seen that the DC voltage\nbalance capabilities of three overall individual DC voltage\nbalance strategies can be ranked as: the proposed strategy >\nstrategy 2 >strategy 1.\nCase 4: The AC port of the output stage is connected with\nan 1 resistor per phase. At ﬁrst, EPT is stable under the\ncondition that a 3 mH inductor and a 2 mH inductor are\nparalleled as the ﬁltering inductor of the third inverter of\nphase c. At t3, the 2 mH inductor is tripped.\nUnder case 4, the ﬁltering inductors of three paralleled\ninverters are 3 mH, 3 mH and 1.2 mH at the beginning.\nFig. 12(a) shows the dynamic waveforms of the trip process.\nFig. 12(b) shows the steady-state waveforms before the 2 mH\ninductor is tripped. In Fig. 12(b), three output currents are\nequal and have the same phase with the output voltage,\nwhich indicates there are no reactive circulating currents\nby employing the individual low-voltage DC-link balance\nstrategy.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, an overall individual DC voltage balance strat-\negy has been proposed for EPT with the separated DC-link\ntopology in this paper. The DC voltage balance capabilities\nof the three overall individual DC voltage balance strategies\nhave been analyzed and ranked. The ranking results indicate\nthat the proposed strategy has the strongest DC voltage bal-\nance capability. This conclusion is supported by the exper-\nimental veriﬁcation. The experimental results have shown\nthat the individual high-voltage and low-voltage DC-links can\nbe well balanced with the proposed strategy when there are\nsevere component parameter mismatches or there is a large\nproportion of DC power in the total power. In fact, with\nthe proposed strategy, the individual high-voltage and low-\nvoltage DC-links can be balanced under severe unbalanced\nconditions as long as the powers ﬂowing through the PM are\nwithin the maximum allowed power (e.g., 1 .2 ∗Prated in this\npaper).\nThe proposed strategy is applied in the condition that there\nare only one high-voltage DC port and one low-voltage DC\nport per phase. However, the proposed strategy is irrelevant to\nthe number of the DC ports, and they are also suitable for the\ncondition that there are i(0 ≤i ≤n) high-voltage DC ports\nand j(0 ≤j ≤n) low-voltage DC ports per phase.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.
