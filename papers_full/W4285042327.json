In this\nprocess, the safety and reliability of the power system became important concerns to be addressed.\nWith the narrower proﬁt margin, the system operators face multiple challenges: ensuring safety,\nreducing electricity prices, and increasing efﬁciency. In recent years, the system operator of China,\nState Grid, has found a relatively low age among scrapped samples and a relatively high proportion of\nover-aged samples among the transformer equipment. The problems are as follows: First, the\nscrapping age of substation equipment is usually 6–10 years, and the average service life of main\nequipment is lower than the transformer depreciation period and the pricing depreciation period. To\na certain extent, this will result in a waste of depreciation costs. It is difﬁcult to fully incorporate into\nthe cost of transmission and distribution prices. Second, the over-aged transformers have accounted\nfor 10% of the original value of the physical assets of the power grid. Some of the over-aged\ntransformers can still operate normally. Under strict supervision and examination requirements, the\nover-aged transformers cannot be depreciated, which reduces the electricity price level and the\ncompany’s investment capacity.\nReliability is an important indicator for verifying the safe operation of equipment (Song and\nCheng, 2015). It refers to the ability or possibility of equipment to perform speciﬁed functions\nwithout failure within a certain period and under certain conditions (Song, 2001). Overall, the\noperating life of primary equipment in the power grid is signiﬁcantly different, and this difference\nincreases the difﬁculty of primary equipment reliability assessment and reasonable life estimation.\nParticularly in theﬁeld of reasonable life prediction of transformers, this difference in phenomena is\nrarely studied in current research.\nEdited by:\nYushuai Li,\nUniversity of Oslo, Norway\nReviewed by:\nYin Yao,\nShanghai University of Electric Power,\nChina\nYuan Chen,\nAnhui University, China\nHengrui Ma,\nQinghai University, China\nTongmao Zhang,\nThe University of Manchester,\nUnited Kingdom, in collaboration with\nreviewer HM\n*Correspondence:\nLie Li\nlilie@whu.edu.cn\nSpecialty section:\nThis article was submitted to\nSmart Grids,\na section of the journal\nFrontiers in Energy Research\nReceived: 27 April 2022\nAccepted: 31 May 2022\nPublished: 12 July 2022\nCitation:\nHe L, Li L, Li M, Li Z and Wang X (2022)\nA Deep Learning Approach to the\nTransformer Life Prediction\nConsidering Diverse Aging Factors.\nFront.

The\nreasonable life estimation of the transformer also belongs to the\ncategory of fault prediction. The main method is to predict the\npossible future failures through the historical data obtained by\nmonitoring and to ascertain the remaining life. At present,\ntransformer life prediction models can be divided into\nphysical failure mechanism models and data-driven models\n(Abu-Elanien and Salama, 2012 ; Zhou, 2013; Ignacio et al.,\n2018; Zhang et al., 2018). The physical failure mechanism model\nis based on the transformer failure mechanism and\nmathematically characterizes the material failure process.\nChen and Liu (2020) proposed a transformer life prediction\nmodel based on the hidden Markov model. Shi et al. (2020)\nestablished the Arrhenius equation based on the degradation\nmechanism of variable activation energy and then predicted the\nremaining life of the transformer. Based on the data-driven life\nmodel, the operating parameters that can characterize the\ndegree of transformer degradation are obtained mainly based\non the monitoring technology, and the operating trend of the\nparameters is directly predicted ( Hu et al., 2022). Common\noperating parameters include vibration signal, noise signal, and\ninsulating oil content (Bacha et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2013; Tian\net al., 2013; Guo et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2020). This method does\nnot involve a speciﬁc failure mechanism, so it has a wider scope\nincluding the long-short-term memory network –based life\nprediction model (Dai et al., 2021), the life prediction model\nbased on the SVM algorithm with RBF as the kernel function,\netc. (Wang, 2021).\nHowever, both the physical failure mechanism model and the\ndata-driven model are based on the speciﬁc operating conditions\nof the transformer, that is, monitoring the parameter distribution\nof the equipment in the time series and space series and\npredicting the life through the model (Ishak, 2010; Husnayain\net al., 2016; Qian et al., 2018). However, the model established\nbased on the aforementioned method has some limitations\nbecause the parameters are derived from a single device, so\nthe application object is also limited to a speci ﬁc type of\ndevice. State Grid’s transformers have the characteristics of a\nlarge number of equipments, wide distribution, and complex\nsources. It is difﬁcult to use traditional methods to evaluate the\nlife of all equipment.\nBased on a convolutional neural network, this article proposes\na transformer life prediction method considering the difference in\ntransformer life. First, according to the factory information and\nscrap age information of scrapped transformers provided by a\ncompany, four types of data of rated capacity, voltage level,\nmanufacturer, and workplace are screened out. The\ncharacteristics of its life distribution are analyzed, respectively,\nand data of average life, life concentration, and the proportion of\nhigh-life equipment and low-life equipment were obtained. The\naforementioned total of 16 data were taken as input, and the\ntransformer age was taken as output. The convolutional neural\nnetwork was trained to obtain the life prediction model.\nCompared with the traditional life prediction model, the\nadvantages of the model proposed in this article are 1)\nconsidering the inﬂuence of the life difference phenomenon\non the reliability of the transformer, the prediction accuracy is\nimproved; 2) since the input is the equipment delivery and\noperation information and does not involve the speci ﬁc\noperation conditions, the life prediction can be carried out\nbefore operation, and the operation and maintenance strategy\ncan be formulated as soon as possible according to the prediction\nresults.\nLIFE DIFFERENCE PHENOMENON\nStatistical statistics are carried out on the decommissioned,\nscrapped, and to-be-scrapped transformers of a power supply\ncompany, and a statistical graph is drawn, as shown inFigure 1.I t\ncan be found that the life distribution of the transformer is close\nto the normal distribution. Most of the equipment life is in the\nmiddle interval, and there are few high-life equipment and low-\nlife equipment. However, this phenomenon increases the\ndifﬁculty of equipment operation and maintenance. For\npossible low-life equipment, it should be the focus of attention\nFIGURE 1 |Life distribution.\nTABLE 1 |Corresponding parameters of equipment with rated capacity.\nRated capacity αβ Ex h xl\n1 36.15 4.324 32.91 40% 40%\n1.6 18.73 1.995 16.60 0 17%\n1.8 29.64 4.504 27.05 0 0\n2 22.56 2.218 19.98 0 0\n2.5 25.94 2.516 23.02 15% 0\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9300932\nHe et al. Transformer AI-based Life Prediction”\nand is necessary to increase the frequency of maintenance, timely\nmaintenance, and improve equipment reliability. For possible\nlong-life equipment, appropriate attention can be reduced to save\ncosts, analyzing the life distribution chart; dividing the equipment\ninto older equipment, normal equipment, and younger\nequipment according to the distribution law of equipment life;\nand counting their proportions in the total equipment\nrespectively; and summarizing the distribution law of\nequipment life. The equipment is divided into 5-year intervals.\nWith the increase in service life, the service life in this interval\nincreases ﬁrst and then decreases; The pieces of equipment with a\nservice life of 11–15 years are more than twice that of 6–10 years,\nand the increase is signiﬁcantly greater than that in other ranges.\nThe pieces of equipment with a service life of 36–40 years are less\nthan 1/2 of that of 31–35 years, and the decrease is signiﬁcantly\ngreater than that in other intervals. Therefore, equipment with a\nservice life of 10 years or less (main transformer and\ndisconnector) is de ﬁned as low-life equipment, equipment\nwith a service life of 36 years or more is deﬁned as high-life\nequipment, and other equipment is deﬁned as normal equipment.\nWhen the equipment is put into operation, it is necessary to\nevaluate the reliability of the equipment to facilitate the\nformulation of the operation and maintenance strategy. Due to\nthe lack of operational data as the basis for evaluation, the\nequipment can only be roughly evaluated through historical\ndata, such as manufacturer and operation city before the\nequipment is put into operation. Due to different production\nprocesses, equipment produced by different manufacturers will\nalso have different characteristics in reliability. Similarly, different\noperating cities will have different working environments, which\nwill further affect the reliability of the equipment. The extraction\nof reliable data from this kind of text information is key to the\nreliable evaluation of equipment before operation.\nEXTRACTION OF TRANSFORMER AGING\nFACTORS\nIn the transformer operation and maintenance data, the\naverage life is the most intuitive embodiment of equipment\nreliability, and it is also important data that can be used for\nlife prediction. However, the data on average life cannot reﬂect\nthe impact of life differentiation. Therefore, it is necessary to\nextract the aging factors that can reﬂect the phenomenon of life\ndifferentiation from the transformer life distribution data to\nimprove the accuracy of reasonable life prediction.\nThe life differentiation characteristics of equipment can be\ndescribed by three parameters: life concentration, the proportion\nof high-life equipment, and low-life equipment. Life\nconcentration indicates the concentration degree of\ntransformer life distribution. The more the proportion of main\ntransformers is close to the average life, the higher the life\nconcentration. The proportion of high life and low life is the\nproportion of transformers with a life of more than 35 years and\nless than 10 years in the total number, which can be obtained\ndirectly through statistics.\nBecause the Weibull distribution can be used to describe the\ncharacteristics of equipment life distribution, life concentration\nand average life can be expressed by the relevant characteristics of\nthe Weibull distribution ( Zhou et al., 2013 ). The Weibull\ndistribution was proposed by Swedish physicist W. Weibull in\n1939. It is mainly used to describe the probability distribution of\nmaterial fatigue strength. The Weibull distribution is widely used\nin reliability engineering, especially in the distribution form of\ncumulative wear failure of electromechanical products.

The larger the β, the more concentrated the life\ndistribution. The smaller the β, the more dispersed the life\ndistribution. The average life of the equipment can be expressed\nby mathematical expectations. Therefore, the average life of the\nequipment can be calculated according to the parameters of the\nWeibull distribution and the service life expectation, as shown\nin Eq.

Transformer AI-based Life Prediction”\nAI-BASED APPROACH TO THE LIFE\nPREDICTION MODEL\nConvolutional Neural Network\nIn recent years, with the rapid development of the computer\nﬁeld, deep learning has been applied to all aspects. The\nconvolutional neural network possesses a considerable ability\nfor face recognition and image recognition and has great\napplication prospects in the ﬁeld of transformer fault\ndiagnosis. In this article, a reasonable life prediction model of\na transformer is constructed based on a convolutional neural\nnetwork. A convolutional neural network generally includes an\ninput layer, convolution layer, pooling layer, full connection layer,\nand output layer (Zhou et al., 2017). Taking one-dimensional\ndata as an example, its general structure is shown inFigure 2.\nThe input layer is the input data of some characteristic\nquantities, including rated capacity, voltage level,\nmanufacturer, and workplace. These are transformed into\ndigital features using the Weibull distribution as input, such as\nx\n1,x 2,x 3, as shown inFigure 2.\nThe convolution layer is equivalent to a feature-extraction\nprocess. The important features are extracted through the\nconvolution kernel during the movement of the input layer, as\nshown in Figure 2. Taking the 1*3 convolution kernel as an\nexample, the calculation process is as follows:\nc\nn /equals xn × ω1 + xn+1 × ω2 + xn+2 × ω3 + bn, (5)\nwhere x is input,ω is the weight, and b is the offset. The calculated\nresults can use Relu, Tanh, and other activation functions as the\noutput of each neuron in the convolution layer, that is,\nC\nn /equals f(cn). The expression of the activation function is as\nfollows:\nRelu f(x) /equals max(0,x ), (6)\nTanh f(x) /equals ex − e−x\nex + e−x.( 7 )\nThe pooling layer mainly reduces the amount of calculation in\nthe neural network, as shown in Figure 2. Taking the 1*2\nmaximum pooling layer as an example, the calculation process\nis as follows:\np\nn /equals max(Cn,C n+1).( 8 )\nThe full connection layer is the neural network, as shown in\nFigure 2. Its calculation steps are as follows:\nFIGURE 4 |Training process.\nFIGURE 5 |Prediction results.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9300935\nHe et al. Transformer AI-based Life Prediction”\ndn /equals ∑\n1\nm\npm × ωmn + bn.( 9 )\nSimilarly, the calculated results can use Relu, Tanh, and other\nactivation functions as the output of each neuron in the whole\nconnection layer, that is,D\nn /equals f(dn).\nThe calculation process of the output layer is the same as that\nof the full connection layer. As shown inEq. 9, the Softmax\nfunction is used in the activation function, and the expression is\nas follows:\nSoftmax f(x) /equals exi\n∑\nn\ni/equals 0\nexi\n. (10 )\nLife Prediction Model\nThe life prediction model is shown inFigure 3. First, the four\ncharacteristic quantities of voltage grade, rated capacity,\nmanufacturer, and workplace are obtained using the Weibull\ndistribution, and a total of 16 characteristics are used as the input\nlayer of the model. The data output from the convolution layer is\nfused through the data, integrated into one-dimensional data, and\nsent to the fully connected neural network. The life prediction is\ndivided into eight intervals. 1–5 years is theﬁrst interval, and the\nprobability of the result falling into this interval is P1. 6–10 years\nis the second interval, and the probability of the result falling into\nthis interval is P2, and so on. The last interval is 35–40 years, and\nthe probability of the result falling into this interval is P8. The\nactivation layer of the convolutional neural network adopts the\nRelu function, the fully connected neural network adopts the\nTanh function, and the output layer adopts the Softmax function\n(see Table 5 for speciﬁc parameters).\nACCURACY VERIFICATION OF LIFE\nPREDICTION MODEL\nVeriﬁcation of AI-Based Approach to the\nLife Prediction Model\nK-fold cross-validation is adopted for the data set. That is, the\ndata set is divided into k copies, of which k-1 is used as training\ndata and the remaining one is used as test data. There are 501\ngroups of transformer data in total. A total of 100 groups were\nconsidered test data and the rest as training data. The training\nprocess is shown inFigure 4.\nThe prediction results of the last 100 test data are shown in\nFigure 5. Through TSNE visualization, the classiﬁcation results of\n100 data types are displayed, as shown inFigure 6.\nFIGURE 6 |TSNE visualization results.\nFIGURE 7 |Confusion matrix.\nTABLE 6 |Comparison of different life prediction models.\nLife prediction model Accuracy (%)\nDecision tree 65.4\nRandom forest 71.2\nSupport vector machine 62.6\nNeural network 75.00\nConvolutional neural network 84.83\nFIGURE 8 |Model training process without considering life difference.\nFrontiers in Energy Research | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9300936\nHe et al. Transformer AI-based Life Prediction”\nIt can be seen fromFigure 5that most of the prediction results\nare consistent. Each color inFigure 6 represents a prediction\ninterval. It can be seen that the graphs of each interval are well\ndistinguished. It shows that the life prediction model has high\naccuracy, and the life prediction confusion matrix of each\nclassiﬁcation is shown inFigure 7.\nThe accuracy is low due to the small number of training and\ntests in the eighth division. The prediction accuracy of other life\nintervals is high, which is more than 80%.\nComparison With Other Models\nTo verify the superiority of the model in transformer life\nprediction, the model is compared with the following other\nmodels.\n1) Prediction results of different models\nTo verify the ability of the convolutional neural network in life\nprediction, decision tree, random forests, support vector\nmachine, neural network, and deep conﬁdence network were\nused to simulate the same data. The simulation results are shown\nin Table 6.\nIt can be seen from Table 6 that a convolutional neural\nnetwork has higher prediction accuracy in transformer life\nprediction. Compared with the current common prediction\nalgorithms, the accuracy is improved by more than 10%.\n2) Inﬂuence of life differentiation on life prediction results\nTo verify the impact of life differentiation on life prediction\nresults, only the average life in the data of rated capacity, voltage\nlevel, manufacturer, and the working city was considered. Four\ndata ofk\n1, k5, k9,a n dk11 were used as the input of the convolutional\nneural network. The training results are shown inFigure 8.\nAccording to the results, the prediction accuracy of the\ntransformer life prediction model without considering the\nphenomenon of life differentiation can only reach 40.37%.\nCompared with the model proposed in this article, the\naccuracy was reduced by 52.41%. This is because more\ncharacteristic information was extracted from the transformer\nlife distribution data, which improved the identiﬁcation of the\ntraining data and thus improved theﬁnal accuracy.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the statistics of the scrapped data of transformers\nprovided by power supply companies, this article analyzes the\nimpact of life differentiation on the reliability evaluation of\ntransformers. According to this phenomenon, the information\ncontaining life-differentiation information is extracted from the\ndata and used as the input of the life prediction model based on a\nconvolutional neural network. Compared with other prediction\nalgorithms, the superiority of the convolutional neural network in\nlife prediction is veriﬁed. In comparison with the life prediction\nmodel without considering the phenomenon of life\ndifferentiation, it is veri ﬁed that the life prediction model\nconsidering the phenomenon of life differentiation has higher\nprediction accuracy.\nIn the future, the transformer life prediction method based on\nan AI approach will become the mainstream in the industry.\nHowever, it still needs to overcome the dependence on the data\nsample size.
