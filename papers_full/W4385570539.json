However, pretraining has\nrecently shifted toward larger models and larger\ndata, and this has resulted in significant com-\nputational and energy costs. In this paper,\nwe propose Influence Subset Selection (ISS)\nfor language model, which explicitly utilizes\nend-task knowledge to select a tiny subset of\nthe pretraining corpus. Specifically, the ISS\nselects the samples that will provide the most\npositive influence on the performance of the\nend-task.

With only 0.45% of the data\nand a three-orders-of-magnitude lower compu-\ntational cost, ISS outperformed pretrained mod-\nels (e.g., RoBERTa) on eight datasets covering\nfour domains.\n1 Introduction\nPretrained language models (PTMs) (Peters et al.,\n2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019), trained\non massive and heterogeneous corpora, have sig-\nnificantly improved the state-of-the-art across a\nvariety of natural language processing tasks (Wang\net al., 2022, 2023). Kaplan et al. (2020) found\npower laws relating cross entropy loss to the sizes\nof language models and their training datasets. As\na result, the field has recently shifted toward larger\nmodels and large data (Brown et al., 2020; Rae\net al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al.,\n2022) in hopes of improving performance.\nHowever, training a state-of-the-art language\nmodel requires substantial computational resources\nwhich demand considerable energy, along with\nthe associated financial and environmental costs\n(Strubell et al., 2019). For example, RoBERTa-\nLarge (Liu et al., 2019), which was trained on\n∗ ∗Equal contribution.\n†Corresponding Author\nPLMs TLM ISS\nTraining Data The entireD Subset ofD\n& task dataT\nSubset ofD\n& task dataT\nCompute Cost 240000\nGPU·hours\n240\nGPU·hours\n80\nGPU·hours\nGenerality Task-Agnostic X-Dep X&Y-Dep\nTable 1: Qualitative comparison between PLMs, TLM,\nand ISS(ours). X/Y-Dep means the pretraining data is\nX/Y dependent.\n1000 V100 GPUs for approximately one day, has a\ncomputational cost of4.36×1021 FLOPs. Recently,\nChowdhery et al. (2022) proposes PaLM, which\nconsumes 580 times more FLOPs than RoBERTa-\nLarge. PaLM was trained on 6144 TPU v4 chips\nfor more than 1200 hours, which is unaffordable for\nmost researchers. Therefore, finding ways to speed\nup pretraining is crucial for the development of\npretrained model research.\nIn general, there are three main strategies used\nto speed up pretraining in NLP: parallel archi-\ntectures, efficient model architectures, and novel\npretraining tasks. The first one is to train a single\nmodel utilizing multiple GPUs distributed in many\ncomputational nodes (Wang et al., 2020b; Shazeer\net al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019). Unfortunately,\nthe gains in efficiency of this strategy depend\nentirely on the amount of computing hardware\nused. The second strategy is to improve model\nstructures to reduce the computational complexity\nand therefore improve efficiency (Wang et al.,\n2020a; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021).\nThe last one explores more challenging pretraining\ntasks to accelerate a model’s convergence (Clark\net al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2020; Levine et al., 2020).\nHowever, their improvements are limited, with a\nreduction of less than an order of magnitude in\ncomputational expenses (measured in FLOPs).\nIn this paper, we aim to reduce the computational\ncosts from data level (See Table 1). The PLMs are\ntrained on the entire pretraining corpus D, which\nis task-agnostic. To take the downstream task\n555\ninto account, we hope to select the most relevant\nsamples from the pretraining corpus based on the\ndownstream data. Recently, Yao et al. (2022) pro-\nposes TLM, which retrieves data from a pretraining\ncorpus using task data as queries. However, TLM\nremains task-agnostic, because it only considers\ntext (i.e., X) similarities and ignores the label (i.e.,\nY) information.\nMotivated by influence function (Cook and Weis-\nberg, 1982; Koh and Liang, 2017), we propose\nInfluential Subset Selection (ISS) for language\nmodel, i.e. selecting the samples with the most\npositive influence on the downstream task. To cal-\nculate the label-aware influence value, ISS utilizes\nthe derivation chain rule from a test objective to\ntraining samples. Nevertheless, directly applying\nthe chain rule leads to computing the inverse of\nHessian with the complexity of O(nq2 + q3)(n is\nthe number of examples and q is parameter size),\nwhich is computationally expensive and may run\nout-of-memory in neural networks. To address\nthis problem, we propose a gradient matching\nbased influence approximation method for select-\ning pretraining data, which estimates the influence\nscore by matching the gradient values of pretrain-\ning samples and end-task samples. Our method\navoids the computation of the inverse of Hessian\nand significantly speeds up the estimation time of\ninfluence.\nOur main contributions are summarized as fol-\nlows:\n• We propose Influential Subset Selection for lan-\nguage model, which explicitly utilizes knowledge\nof the end-task to select the pretraining corpus.\n• We design a simple, efficient, gradient matching\nbased method for influence estimation, which\navoids the calculation of the inverse of Hessian\nand significantly speeds up the estimation time.\n• We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on\neight tasks covering four domains. Notably,\nISS outperforms PTMs (e.g. RoBERTa) with\nonly 0.45% of the data and three orders of\nmagnitude reduced FLOPS. Our code can be\nfound at https://github.com/nitwtog/ISS.\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Definition\nWe assume an end-task dataset rep-\nresented as T = ( Zt) where Zt =\n{\n(x1\nt,y1\nt),(x2\nt,y2\nt),..., (xm\nt ,ym\nt )\n}\nrepresents\na set of texts with their ground truth labels. And we\nassume a large-scale pretraining corpus D= (Zp),\nwhere Zp =\n{\nx1\np,x2\np,...,x M\np\n}\nrepresents\nunlabeled data. We define f = f(head) ◦f(feat),\nsuch that f(feat)(·; θ ∈ Θ) is a feature extractor\nthat is transferable across learning stages (e.g.\npretraining to finetuning) and f(head)(·; ϕ∈Φ) is a\ntask-specific head that is not transferable. And we\nassume lp(zp,θ,ϕ p) and lt(zt,θ,ϕ t) are the loss\nfunctions of pretraining and end-task.\n2.2 Influence Function\nInfluence function (Cook and Weisberg, 1982;\nKoh and Liang, 2017) provides an efficient way\nto estimate the importance of a training sample.\nConsidering a training sample z was weighted\nby a small ϵ during training, the empirical risk\nminimizer can be written as\nˆθϵ,z = arg min\nθ∈Θ\n1\nn\n∑\nzi∈D\nl(zi,θ) + ϵ·l(z,θ) (1)\nAssigning −1\nn to ϵis equivalent to removing the\ntraining example zp. Then, the influence of weight-\ning zp on the parameters is given by\nIparam (z) = dˆθϵ,z\ndϵ\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\nϵ=0\n= −H−1\nˆθ ∇θl(z,ˆθ) (2)\nwhere Hˆθ = 1\nn\n∑\nzi∈D∇2\nθl\n(\nzi,ˆθ\n)\nis the Hessian\nand positive definite by assumption, Iparam (z) ∈\nRN , N is the number of network parameters. Then,\nwe can linearly approximate the parameter change\ndue to removing z without retraining the model by\ncomputing ˆθ−z −ˆθ≈−1\nnIparam (z).\n3 Methodology\nWe investigate an influence-based subset selection\nmethod to perform efficient pretraining while at-\ntempting to minimize accuracy loss on the end-task\ndataset (Section 3.1). Due to the high computa-\ntional costs of influence function (Koh and Liang,\n2017), we design an influence approximation strat-\negy to speed up the calculation (Section 3.2).\n3.1 Influence of Pretraining Corpus\nPTMs used in previous works usually adopt lan-\nguage modeling as pretraining tasks, lacking task-\nspecific prior knowledge. However, we often\nknow the end-task beforehand, so we can make\n556\nspecific choices about our pretraining regimen to\nimprove end-task performance. Under this setting,\nwe introduce Influential Subset Selection for lan-\nguage model, which measures the importance of\npretraining samples by considering the X and Y\ninformation of the end-task simultaneously.\nSpecifically, pretraining sample zp affects the\nprediction of end-task sample zt by influencing\nthe parameters of the feature encoder θ. We can\napply the chain rule to measure the influence of\nupweighting pretraining sample zp on the loss at\nend-task sample zt.\nI(zp,zt) ≜\ndl\n(\nzt,ˆθϵ,z\n)\ndϵ\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\nϵ=0\n= ∇θl\n(\nzt,ˆθ\n)⊤dˆθϵ,z\ndϵ\n⏐⏐⏐⏐⏐\nϵ=0\n= −∇θl\n(\nzt,ˆθ\n)⊤\nH−1\nˆθ ∇θl(zp,ˆθ)\n(3)\nThe more negative I(zp,zt) is, the more posi-\ntive influence zp can provide. However, computing\nthe Hessian for the full training dataset is expensive,\nand inverting it is similarly prohibitive: with n\ntraining data points and p parameters, this com-\nputation requires O(n∗p2 + p3) operations. It\nmeans that evaluating the influence of large-scale\npretrained corpus is not achievable. Thus, we\npropose an influence approximation algorithm to\nspeed up the estimation time.\n3.2 Influence Approximation\nMotivated by calculus, the update of the model\nparameters is the result of cumulative updates over\nseveral training iterations. Similarly, the difference\nbetween the loss of test point zt at the end of\ntraining versus at the beginning of training can\nbe decomposed along the path taken by the training\nprocess. Thus, we hypothesize that the influences\nof all training examples on a fixed test point zt is\nexactly the total reduction in loss on zt.\nAssume that we train the feature encoder by\nminimizing the pertaining loss lp(zp; θ,ϕ), via an\niterative optimization procedure (such as SGD)\nwhich utilizes one training example zp in iteration\nt. The parameters of the feature encoder before and\nafter iteration t are θt and θt+1 respectively. The\ninfluence of zt on zp can be approximated in the\nfollowing way.\nI(zp,zt) = lt(zp,θt) −lt(zp,θt+1) (4)\n𝜃𝑔!𝑔\" 𝑔#\n𝑔\"#𝑔#>𝑔!#𝑔#: loss landscape of pre-training: loss landscape of end-task: gradient of pre-training sample: gradient of end-task sample\nFigure 1: Illustration of gradient matching based influ-\nence approximation. g1 and g2 are the loss gradients of\ntwo different pretrained samples respectively, whileg′is\nthe loss gradient of the end-task sample. The influence\nof a pretrained sample is measured by how a small step\nbased on its gradient affects the loss on the end-task\nsample. Compared to g1, the update step of g2 is more\ngeneralized.\nSuppose we are at point θt, and we make a first-\norder Taylor expansion of function lp(zp,θt+1).\nlt(zp,θt+1) =lt(zp,θt) +∇θlt(zp,θt) ·(θt+1 −θt)\n+ O\n(\n∥θt+1 −θt∥2\n)\n(5)\nAssuming the model employs SGD as the opti-\nmizer, then the update in parameters isθt+1 −θt =\n−ηt∇θlp(zt,θt), where ηt is the learning rate at\niteration t. Eq. (5) guarantees approximation\nprecision as long as the update magnitude of θ\nis sufficiently small. By substituting the parameter\nupdate formula and disregarding the higher-order\nterm, we arrive at the following first-order approxi-\nmation.\nlt\n(\nz′,θt\n)\n−lt\n(\nz′,θt+1\n)\n≈ηt∇θlt\n(\nz′,θt\n)\n·∇θlp(zt,θt)\n(6)\nWe refer to this first-order approximation as gradi-\nent matching-based influence estimation. The full\nalgorithm is provided in Algorithm 1.\nVisualisation We visualize our influence es-\ntimation method in Fig 1. g1 and g2 are the\nloss gradients of two different pretrained samples\nrespectively, while g′ is the loss gradient of the\nend-task sample. The influence of a pretrained\nsample can be viewed as the dot product of its\ngradient and the gradient of the end-task sample.\nHigher influence suggests that a network is learning\nparameters that generalize.\n557\nAlgorithm 1: Influential Subset Selection\nfor Language Model\nRequire: Pretraining corpus D; task\ntraining set Tt and validation set\nTv; learning rate α; initial subset\nS; candidates size k.\nRandom initialize network θ,ϕp,ϕt\nˆθ, ˆϕp, ˆϕt = arg min 1\nn\n∑\nzi∈Tt lp(zi) + lt(zi)\nfor zp ∈D do\nCompute ∇θlp\n(\nzp,ˆθ, ˆϕp\n)\nend\nfor z′∈Tv do\nCompute ∇θlt\n(\nz′,ˆθ, ˆϕt,\n)\nfor zp ∈D do\nI(zp,z′) =\n∇θlp\n(\nzp,ˆθ, ˆϕp\n)\n·∇θlt\n(\nz′,ˆθ, ˆϕt,\n)\nend\nSort pretraining samples based on influence\nAdd top k influential samples to S\nend\nReturn influential subset S\n3.3 Implementation Details\nBased on the influence score, we select the most\nrelevant samples from the pretraining corpus. Fol-\nlowing TLM, we first select a subset via a BM25\nretrieval method. Then, we compute the influence\nscore based on this subset to make ISS scalable and\nefficient.\nMoreover, the number of parameters in large-\nscale language models is very large, leading to very\nhigh dimensional gradients. To tackle this problem,\nwe adopt a last-layer gradient approximation by\nonly considering the last layer gradients of pre-\ntrained encoder. We select a subset of mini-batches\nby matching the weighted sum of mini-batch pre-\ntraining gradients to the mini-batch task gradients.\nLet Bp and Bt be the batch size of pretraining and\nend-task. The use of mini-batches considerably\nreduces the number of selection rounds during the\nISS algorithm by a factor of B, resulting inBp∗Bt\nspeed up.\n4 Experimental Setup\nTo evaluate the efficiency and generality of our\napproach, we conduct experiments in two settings:\npretraining from scratch, and further pretraining.\n4.1 Pretraining from Scratch\nDatasets. Following the setting of Gururangan\net al. (2020); Yao et al. (2022), we conduct ex-\nperiments on eight tasks covering four domains,\nincluding biomedical science, computer science,\nnews, and reviews. The tasks represent both\nhigh- and low-resource ( ≤5K samples) settings,\nincluding CHEMPROT (Kringelum et al., 2016),\nRCT (Dernoncourt and Lee, 2017), ACL-ARC\n(Jurgens et al., 2018), SCIERC (Luan et al., 2018),\nHyPERPARTISAN (Kiesel et al., 2019), AGNEws\n(Zhang et al., 2015), HELPFULNESS (McAuley\net al., 2015), IMDB (Maas et al., 2011). Table 2\nreports the statistic results of various target datasets.\nSimilar to TLM (Yao et al., 2022), we collect\ntwo pretraining corpora that respectively match the\noriginal corpora of BERT and RoBERTa. We name\nthem CBERT and CRoBERTa, respectively.\nBaselines. We focus on comparison with general\nPLMs and TLM. Following Yao et al. (2022), we\nfinetuned both BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and\nRoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) of base and large scales\nas our baselines. And we finetuned the released\nTLM models as baselines.\nEvaluation Strategy. The results of the experi-\nment are the average performance of three random\nseeds with the standard deviations. Following\nGururangan et al. (2020), we report the test micro-\nF1 for ChemProt and RCT, and macro-F1 for the\nrest of datasets. Following TLM (Yao et al., 2022),\nwe set three pretraining scales, namely small,\nmedium, and large scales. Differently, at the\nsame scale, our method only utilizes 20% size of\nthe TLM data. More detailed settings are shown in\nTable A.1 in Appendix.\nTraining Details. We utilize the randomly\ninitialized BERT of base scale as our starter mod-\nels. We mostly follow optimization, and hyper-\nparameters choices used in Yao et al. (2022). All ex-\nperiments were conducted on 4 NVIDIA GeForce\nRTX 3090 GPUs.

(2020).\n3 ISS utilizes 20% of the TLM size data, so we implemented the TLM model with the same size version.\n4 For a fair comparison, we implement TLM(Large) with BERT base and TLM large scale dataset.\nTable 3: Evaluation results for ISS at three different training scales. For each task, we report the average F1 score\nacross three random seeds with standard deviations as subscripts. We also show the number of parameters, the total\ntraining compute (FLOPs), and the size of training corpus for comparison.\n4.2 Further Pretraining\nDatasets. We perform further pretraining in\nbiomedical science and computer science domains.\nSpecifically, we conduct experiments on four\ndatasets, including CHEMPROT (Kringelum et al.,\n2016), RCT (Dernoncourt and Lee, 2017), ACL-\nARC (Jurgens et al., 2018), SCIERC (Luan et al.,\n2018). For the pretraining stage, we collect the\nunlabeled datasets from S2ORC (Lo et al., 2020).\nBaselines. We select general PTMs (Devlin\net al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019) and domain-specific\nfurther pretraining models (Lee et al., 2020; Belt-\nagy et al., 2019; Gururangan et al., 2020) as our\nbaselines. Finetuning on the end-task occurs after\nfurther pretraining on domain unlabeled corpora.\nEvaluation Strategy. Similar to pretraining\nfrom scratch, we report the average performance\nacross three random seeds. And we report the\nmicro-F1 for ChemProt and RCT, and macro-F1\nfor ACL-ARC and SCIERC.\nTraining Details. In this setting, we perform\nfurther pretraining on off-the-shelf pretrained mod-\nels, such as BERT and RoBERTa. All experiments\nwere conducted on 4 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090\nGPUs. Detailed hyper-parameters are provided in\nTable A.2 in Appendix.\n5 Experimental Results\nIn this section, we will discuss the results of\ncomparing our methods against other baselines.\n5.1 Pretraining from Scratch\nTable 3 shows the main results of ISS with the ac-\ncording TLM and PLMs baselines at three different\nscales.

In conclusion, our method outperforms\nall the baselines, with significant reductions in\nFLOPs and the size of training data by one order\nof magnitude or more. It proves our approach is\nfeasible.\n5.3 Comparison of Pretraining Steps\nTo validate the effect of pretraining steps, we\ncompare the performance of ISS with TLM at\ndifferent pretraining steps. The test results on the\nfour tasks with different pretraining steps are shown\nin Figure 3. We observe that ISS could achieve the\nbest performance with fewer steps on most of the\ndatasets.\n5.4 Subset Size for Pretraining\nTo compare the performance at different data scales,\nwe extracted subsets from the TLM small-scale\ncorpus at different scales via ISS and TLM, re-\nspectively.

We have studied the\nrelationship between the gradients at the different\nlayers used in ISS and the corresponding perfor-\nmances. Table 3 shows the results on Chemprot and\nSciERC. We can observe that the closer the layer, to\nthe task head, the better the selected subset works.\nThe phenomena suggest that different layers in the\nlanguage model can capture different information,\nwith layers closer to the task head learning more\ninformation about the task.\nTable 7 shows the times required by ISS calcu-\nlating influences at the different layers. Overall,\nthe time cost of selecting a subset is negligible\ncompared to pretraining. In addition, the computa-\ntional speed based on the last layer would be nearly\nLayer name\nCost times\nSmall Large\nEmbedding 2.0 hours 5.2 hours\n3-th Transformer 1.8 hours 4.8 hours\n6-th Transformer 1.6 hours 4.4 hours\n9-th Transformer 1.4 hours 4.0 hours\n12-th Transformer 1.1 hours 3.6 hours\nTable 7: Comparison of the speed of computing in-\nfluences using different layers.

The results are shown\nin Figure 4. We can observe that the different\nclasses of deep features in ISS-small formed tighter\nclusters, suggesting that ISS provides better initial-\nization for downstream tasks. In contrast, the fea-\ntures learned by BERT and Roberta are distributed\nrespectively in separate clusters with overlapping\nparts that could not be distinguished.\n6.2 Analyzing of Task-influential Words\nWe compute the point-wise mutual information\n(PMI) (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) between words\nand their corresponding labels in the task dataset.\nBriefly, PMI is used to measure the likelihood of\ntwo events occurring together, so the higher the\nPMI a word has, the more likely it is to be task-\ninfluential. We select words with high PMI as task-\ninfluential words, and compare their frequency in\nISS-small and TLM-small datasets, respectively.\nAs shown in Table 6, the word frequency in the\nISS-small dataset is higher than that in the TLM-\nsmall dataset. Thus, ISS may focus more on task-\ninfluential words.\n7 Related Work\n7.1 Efficient Pretraining for PLMs\nMany attempts have been made to improve the\nefficiency of pretraining.

For most Transformer-based\nPTMs, as their input sequence goes longer, their\nefficiency is limited by the computation of attention\nweights. Choromanski et al. (2020) and Wang et al.\n(2020a) design low-rank kernels to theoretically\napproximate the original attention weights. Child\net al. (2019) and Roy et al. (2021) introduce spar-\nsity into attention mechanisms by limiting the view\nof each token to a fixed size and separating tokens\ninto several chunks. ELECTRA (Clark et al., 2019)\napplies the replaced token detection which is more\nchallenging. PMI-Masking (Levine et al., 2020)\nselectively masks tokens based on their importance.\nHowever, their improvements are limited, with less\nthan an order of magnitude reduction in computa-\ntional expenses (measured in FLOPs). Orthogonal\nto these works, ISS investigates reducing training\ndata redundancy by the influence of pretraining\ndata points.\n7.2 Further Pretraning in NLP\nContinually pretraining can effectively improve\nPTMs’ performance on new domains or down-\nstream tasks (Gururangan et al., 2020). To achieve\nit, most previous works continually optimize the\npretrained model parameters on a large number\nof corpora collected from the target domain (e.g.,\nscientific (Beltagy et al., 2019), finance(Araci,\n2019) and bio-media (Lee et al., 2020)). However,\nit is computationally expensive to further pretrain\nthe model on a large amount of unlabeled data and\nit may not be feasible to collect such a large scale\nof unlabeled data on certain domains. In contrast,\nISS does not need any additional domain data\nand only utilizes the general corpus. In addition,\nour approach can also be employed for further\npretraining, as we demonstrate in our experiments.\n7.3 Dataset Pruning\nDataset pruning is closely related to the coreset\nselection methods (Mirzasoleiman et al., 2020;\nAgarwal et al., 2004), which try to identify the most\nrepresentative training samples. Several works\n(Killamsetty et al., 2021; Rebuffi et al., 2017;\nToneva et al., 2018) have studied dataset pruning\nfor efficient training of deep learning models in\nsupervised learning and active learning scenarios.\nDataset pruning methods typically rely on a pre-\ndefined criterion to compute a scalar score for each\ntraining example, e.g. the compactness (Rebuffi\net al., 2017), diversity (Sener and Savarese, 2017),\nand forgetfulness (Toneva et al., 2018), and then\nrank and select the training data according to the\ncomputed score. Recently, Yao et al. (2022) pro-\nposed TLM for transfer learning, which retrieves a\nsubset from the pretraining corpus that is more\nsimilar to the task corpus. However, these methods\nare heuristic and lack of generalization guarantee,\nthey also discard the influence interaction between\nthe collected samples. Our proposed method over-\ncomes these shortcomings.\n8 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we propose Influential Subset Selec-\ntion for language model, which aims to reduce the\ncomputational costs of pretraining from data level.\nSpecifically, we introduce influence function to\nmeasure the importance of each pretraining sample.\nMoreover, we design a simple, efficient, gradient\nmatching-based method for influence estimation,\nwhich significantly speeds up the estimation time.\nExperiments on various datasets demonstrate that\nour method achieves comparable performance with\nPTMs, with a reduction of training FLOPs by three\norders of magnitude.\n562\nLimitations\nThere are two potential risks with our method. First,\nISS trades generality for efficiency by learning\nonly task-specific representations. Consequently,\nit may not be suitable for other tasks. Secondly,\nour method is hardly practical for few-shot or zero-\nshot learning, as few or no task data are available\nas anchor points. These potential risks are left to\nfuture work.\nEthics Statement\nPretraining from scratch and further pretraining\nsuch as DAPT need large-scale unlabeled corpus\nto learn general knowledge, which results in cor-\nresponding greenhouse emissions due to energy\nconsumption (Strubell et al., 2019). However, as\nshown in Section 5, our new efficient algorithms\ngreatly increase the data efficiency of PTMs, re-\nducing these harms as well as the various harms\nassociated with labor for data collection. Our\nwork introduces a new subset selection algorithm\nbut leverages pre-existing datasets and models.\nOverall, this work inherits some of the risks of the\noriginal work upon which it is implemented, (such\nas bias (Bender et al., 2021) or privacy leakage\n(Carlini et al., 2021).\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank the anonymous reviewers\nfor their helpful comments.
