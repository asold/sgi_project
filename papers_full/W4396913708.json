This linking process is crucial for en-\nabling integrative analyses, as biomedical concepts obtained from\ndiverse sources offer multifaceted views of biomedical knowledge\nand data [19, 32]. For example, the electronic health record (EHR),\nwhich is regarded as a valuable asset for comprehensive patient\nhealth analysis, contains various digital medical information in-\ncluding tabular data, clinical notes, and other types of patient data\n[1, 33, 39]. Similarly, the knowledge graph (KG), playing an impor-\ntant role in biomedical research, provides structured knowledge,\nsuch as definitions of concepts and their interrelationships [ 21].\nHowever, the cross-source biomedical linking task is challenging\ndue to discrepancies in the biomedical naming conventions used in\ndifferent systems [15]. For example, a KG may mention a disease\nas “Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome”, while an EHR may refer to the\nsame disease as “Chondroectodermal dysplasia”. This inconsistency\npresents a strong barrier to cohesive data analysis.\nThe challenge of biomedical concept linking has motivated the\ndevelopment of various methods. Conventional methods focus\non setting string-matching rules [7, 13] and leveraging constructed\nthesauri [3, 9, 27]. However, their reliance on fixed rules and crafted\nthesauri limits coverage and generalizability in real-world scenar-\nios [30]. Addressing these limitations, machine learning-based\nmethods have been widely explored, avoiding the manual design of\nrules or thesauri. These methods essentially transform biomedical\nconcepts from raw text into embeddings (latent vector representa-\ntions), which are then used to compute similarity scores via distance\nfunctions (e.g. cosine similarity) or learning-based scoring functions\n(e.g. bilinear attention [14]). Various models have been used to ob-\ntain biomedical concept embeddings, includingpre-trained language\narXiv:2405.07500v1  [cs.IR]  13 May 2024\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA. Yuzhang Xie et al\nFigure 1: A toy example of biomedical concept linking. Left:\nconcepts in the EHR. Right: concepts in the biomedical KG.\nmodels (PLMs) [34] that capture fine-grained semantic relations\nthrough extensive training on biomedical corpora [ 2, 16, 17, 38],\nand graph neural networks (GNNs) [42] that capture both semantics\nand relations of biomedical concepts [4, 10, 18]. Despite the notable\nachievements of these ML-based linking methods, they are data-\nhungry and require significant supervision signals when adapted\ninto novel downstream applications. They face challenges due to\nthe costly data annotation and model training processes.\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impres-\nsive performances in various NLP tasks, due to their unprecedent-\nedly rich prior knowledge and language capabilities [ 31, 35, 43],\nenabling various applications in a zero-shot learning setting [19].\nTherefore, LLMs provide a promising solution for linking related\nconcepts across different systems. Meanwhile, LLMs also face chal-\nlenges including the design of effective and cost-efficient prompts\nwithin the context length limits [40], and the NIL prediction capa-\nbility of reliably rejecting all candidates when correct concepts are\nabsent, instead of returning relatively close but incorrect ones [23].\nIn this paper, we proposePromptLink, leveraging LLMs for the\ncross-source biomedical concept linking task. Considering LLMs’\nhigh cost and context length constraints, we first employ a pre-\ntrained SAPBERT language model to generate biomedical-aware\nconcept embeddings and retrieve top candidates based on the co-\nsine similarities of these embeddings. We then design a novel two-\nstage prompting mechanism for the GPT-4 model to derive reliable\nlinking predictions. The first stage efficiently filters out irrelevant\ncandidates, thereby minimizing the response token numbers re-\nquired in the subsequent stage. The second stage generates the\nfinal linking results and incorporates a self-verification prompt to\naddress the NIL prediction challenge, effectively rejecting all can-\ndidates when none are relevant. In the experiments, PromptLink\ndemonstrates exceptional performance, surpassing various existing\nconcept linking methods by over 5% in two scenarios of biomedical\nconcept linking between EHR and external biomedical KG, which\ncould be attributed to LLM’s intrinsic strong biomedical knowledge.\nMoreover, PromptLink works as a zero-shot framework due to the\nutilization of pre-trained language models, eliminating the need for\na training process. It is also a versatile framework that performs\nwell even when only concept names, without concept context or\ntopological structure, are provided. Given its various advantages,\nPromptLink boasts strong generalization capabilities, making it\nsuitable for a wide range of biomedical research and applications.\n2 Biomedical Concept Linking\n2.1 Problem Definition\nThe biomedical concept linking task aims to link biomedical con-\ncepts across sources/systems based on semantic meanings and\nbiomedical knowledge. It solely relies on concept names and can\nthus cover much broader real-world applications. This task differs\nfrom existing tasks such as entity linking [30], entity alignment [19],\nand ontology matching [11], which depend on extra contextual or\ntopological information. In this study, we link the concepts in EHR\nto corresponding concepts in a biomedical KG. We define an EHR\ndatabase D, a biomedical KG G, and the linking task as follows:\nDefinition 1 (EHR). An EHR database Dis a relational database\nD= (𝑃,𝐴,𝑉 ), with 𝑃 being patient identifiers, 𝐴patient attributes,\n𝑉 ∈𝑃×𝐴the values of these attributes. Additionally,𝑀represents\nmulti-token biomedical concepts associated with patient attributes.\nDefinition 2 (Biomedical KG). A biomedical KG is a multi-relation\ngraph G= (𝐶,𝑅,𝑅𝑇 ), where 𝐶 are concepts, 𝑅are relation names,\nand 𝑅𝑇 ∈𝐶×𝑅×𝐶 are the relational triples among them.\nDefinition 3 (Biomedical Concept Linking). Link identified biomed-\nical concepts from an EHR Dto a biomedical KG Gbased on\nsemantic meanings and biomedical knowledge, forming linkages\n𝐿𝐾 = {(𝑚𝑖,𝑐𝑗)|𝑚𝑖 ∈𝑀D,𝑐𝑗 ∈𝐶G∪NIL}. If a concept 𝑚from 𝐷is\nnot in 𝐺, link it to a special “NIL” entity, indicating it is unlinkable.\n2.2 PromptLink\nWe propose PromptLink, a novel LLM-based solution for cross-\nsource biomedical concept linking, as illustrated in Figure 2. Ad-\ndressing LLMs’ high cost and limited input text length, we first\nemploy a biomedical-specialized pre-trained language model to\ngenerate concept embeddings and retrieve top candidates via co-\nsine similarities. Subsequently, we employ a two-stage prompting\nmechanism with GPT-4 to generate the final linking predictions.\nConcept representation and candidate generation. After pre-\nprocessing text by lowercasing and removing punctuation, we use\na pre-trained LM (specifically SapBERT [17]), to create embeddings\n𝒉 ∈R1×𝑑 for EHR concepts 𝑚and KG concepts 𝑐, represented as\n𝒉𝒎 = 𝑃𝐿𝑀(𝑚), 𝒉𝒄 = 𝑃𝐿𝑀(𝑐).\nFor concepts that span multiple tokens, the token-level embeddings\nare averaged to create the concept embedding. This model helps to\nproject the semantic meanings and prior biomedical knowledge into\nthe embedding space. For candidate generation, we compute cosine\nsimilarity 𝑆 ∈[0,1]between pairs of EHR concept embedding 𝒉𝒎\nand KG concept embedding 𝒉𝒄 , represented as\n𝑆 = 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝒉𝒎,𝒉𝒄 ).\nGiven each input query EHR concept𝑚𝑖, We select the top-𝐾(𝐾=10)\nKG concepts [𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐 𝐾]with the highest similarities as candi-\ndates for further GPT-based linking prediction.\nLinking prediction using two-stage prompts. The next step of\nour framework is generating linking predictions of query 𝑚𝑖 over\nthe top-𝐾 candidate [𝑐1,𝑐2,...,𝑐 𝐾]using GPT-4 model, leveraging\nits text comprehension ability, logical reasoning ability, and prior\nPromptLink: Leveraging Large Language Models for Cross-Source Biomedical Concept Linking SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA.\nFigure 2: Overview of our proposed PromptLink framework.\nbiomedical knowledge [5, 31]. In this step, we design a novel two-\nstage prompt for our task, as can be seen in Figure 2. Combining the\ntwo prompts utilizes their strengths and mitigates weaknesses. The\nfirst stage focuses on concept pairs to filter out unrelated candidates.\nThe second stage evaluates all candidates in a broader context to\nidentify the closest match or reject all unmatch candidates.\nIn the first stage, the LLM is prompted to check if a concept\npair (𝑚𝑖,𝑐𝑗)should be linked. By defining the response structure,\nthe LLM can return answers in specified formats. To improve the\nprompt response quality, we adopt the self-consistency [36] prompt-\ning strategy that repeatedly prompts the same question to the LLM\nmultiple times. Specifically, we prompt each concept pair (𝑚𝑖,𝑐𝑗)\nfor 𝑛= 5 times, thus obtaining the belief score 𝐵𝑖,𝑗 ∈[0,1]by:\n𝐵𝑖,𝑗 = number of “yes” responses\n𝑛 .\nConsidering the belief scores across different candidates, we derive a\ncomprehensive filter strategy to exclude irrelevant candidates, using\nparameter 𝜏 (set as 0.8 ×𝑛). This approach ensures that irrelevant\ncandidates are not considered in the next stage, optimizing both\nefficiency and effectiveness. The approach is described as follows:\n•If 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐵𝑖,1,··· ,𝐵𝑖,𝐾)≥ 𝜏, this indicates some candidates closely\nalign with the query concept. In such cases, candidates with belief\nscores of zero will be filtered out as they are deemed irrelevant\nto the query concept and there are closely aligning alternatives.\nThis filtering strategy effectively removes many irrelevant candi-\ndates, thereby optimizing both efficiency and effectiveness for\nthe subsequent stage.\n•Otherwise, the range of different candidates’ belief scores is not\nwide enough to justify filtering. Thus, all 𝐾 candidates will be\nsubjected to double-checking by the second-stage prompt.\nIn the second stage, the LLM evaluates the 𝐾1 candidates re-\ntained from the first stage’s filtering process[𝑐′\n1,𝑐′\n2,...,𝑐 ′\n𝐾1\n], where\n𝐾1 ≤𝐾 , using a compositional prompt that consists of two con-\nsecutive questions to perform complex reasoning. Specifically, the\nLLM is asked to (1) label the relationship between the query con-\ncept and all candidate concepts as “exact match”, “related to”, or\n“different from”; (2) use self-verification prompts to either identify\nthe closest candidate or dismiss all candidates if none are close,\nthus the final concept linking result of this prompt is 𝐾2 (usually\n𝐾2 = 1) item from [𝑐′\n1,...,𝑐 ′\n𝐾1\n]∪[ NIL]. In this stage, we also use\nthe self-consistency strategy that prompts one question for the\nsame 𝑛times. Subsequently, we calculate the occurrence frequency\n𝑓𝑖,𝑗 ∈[0,1]for answers in [𝑐′\n1,𝑐′\n2,..., NIL]and retrieve the final\nlinking result for query EHR concept 𝑚𝑖 as follows:\n•If 𝑓𝑖, NIL > 0.5, this indicates a high probability that none of the\ncandidates are appropriate. Thus, “NIL” is chosen as the final\nlinking prediction.\n•Otherwise, the candidate 𝑐𝑗 with the highest frequency 𝑓𝑖,𝑗 is\ndecided as the final linking result. If two candidates tie for the\nhighest frequency, the one 𝑐𝑗 with higher embedding similarity\n𝑆𝑖,𝑗 to the query concept 𝑚𝑖 is chosen.\n3 Experiments & Discussions\n3.1 Implementation Details\nDatasets. In our experiments, we curate two biomedical concept\nlinking benchmark datasets: MIID (MIMIC-III-iBKH-Disease) and\nCISE (CRADLE-iBKH-Side-Effect). MIID comprises 1,493 diagnosis\nconcepts from MIMIC-III [12], which is an EHR dataset including\nover 53,423 hospital patient records, and 18,697 disease concepts\nfrom iBKH [32], which is a KG dataset with 2,384,501 entities. To\nconstruct MIID, we first remove exact matches between MIMIC-III\ndiagnosis concepts and iBKH disease concepts. Then, we link the\nremaining MIMIC concepts to iBKH using ICD-9 [ 8] and UMLS\nCUI [28] codes. We use the linked concept pairs as ground-truth la-\nbels only for evaluation purposes. CISE contains 1,500 CRADLE [39]\ndiagnosis concepts and 4,251 iBKH drug side-effect concepts, con-\nstructed by using CUI [28] and SNOMED CT [6] codes. Ground-\ntruth matched pairs are also only used for evaluation purposes.\nExperimental Settings. Following the definition in Sec. 2.1 and\nrecognizing the scarcity of supervision in the biomedical domain,\nwe mainly focus on the biomedical concept linking under the zero-\nshot setting. Additionally, our biomedical concept linking task\nsolely relies on concept names for broad real-world application\ncoverage. Given this characteristic of our data input, graph-based\nlinking methods, such as selfKG [ 18], are not applicable as they\nneed topological information to establish concept alignment. Simi-\nlarly, thesauri-based methods, such as MetaMap [3], are unsuitable\nas they only establish links between EHR concepts and KG concepts\nexisting in the pre-defined vocabulary. Therefore, the following\nbaseline methods are compared:\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA. Yuzhang Xie et al\n•Conventional methods: Cosine Distance , Jaccard Distance ,\nLevenshtein Distance [24], Jaro-Winkler Distance [37], BM25\n[25]. These methods measure the concept pairs’ string similarity\nand relevance and then obtain the linking prediction result.\n•Machine learning-based methods: Pre-trained language mod-\nels are used to generate concept embedding and linking predic-\ntion results (according to embedding cosine similarity). Specif-\nically, we select representative PLMs including BioBERT [16],\nBioGPT [20], BioClinicalBERT [2], BioDistilBERT [26], KRISS-\nBERT [41], ada002 [22], and SAPBERT [17].\n3.2 Concept Linking Experiment Results\nTable 1: Comparison of the zero-shot accuracy for different\nmethods on MIID and CISE.\nMethod Acc-MIID Acc-CISE\nCosine Distance 0.2981 0.2907\nJaccard Distance 0.2123 0.3280\nLevenshtein Distance 0.1995 0.3033\nJaro-Winkler Distance 0.3141 0.3693\nBM25 0.4722 0.3993\nBioBERT 0.3423 0.5280\nBioClinicalBERT 0.3007 0.5007\nBioGPT 0.3530 0.5093\nBioDistilBERT 0.4240 0.5293\nKRISSBERT 0.5265 0.5787\nada002 0.5968 0.6773\nSAPBERT 0.7213 0.8167\nPromptLink 0.7756 0.8880\nTable 1 shows the accuracy of our proposed PromptLink along\nwith baseline methods, when every method links a query EHR\nconcept 𝑚𝑖 with their predicted top-1 KG concept 𝑐𝑗. As can be\nseen, PromptLink outperforms competing approaches across both\ndatasets in terms of zero-shot accuracy, underscoring the supe-\nriority of our LLM-based concept linking methodology. Among\nthe compared methods, SAPBERT, a SOTA biomedical entity link-\ning method, achieves the second-highest performance. Moreover,\nconventional methods based on string similarity lag behind ma-\nchine learning techniques, which leverage embeddings from pre-\ntrained language models to effectively match conceptually similar\nbut lexically distinct entities like “Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome” and\n“Chondroectodermal dysplasia”.\n3.3 Ablation Studies\nTable 2: Ablation results with different prompting methods\nused by PromptLink on the MIID dataset.\nPrompting Methods Acc Token Cost\nBefore Prompting 0.7213 N/A\nFirst-stage Prompt 0.7595 995,836 ($36.59)\nSecond-stage Prompt 0.7634 1,681,987 ($88.69)\nTwo-stage Prompts 0.7756 1,594,996 ($66.25)\nPrompt Effectiveness and Efficiency. We conduct ablation stud-\nies to reveal the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the prompt used\nin our approach, as shown in Table 2. This comparison uses the same\ninput data and 10 linking candidates across various prompts. In the\ntable, the “Before prompting” denotes the performance of using only\nembedding similarity obtained from the pre-trained LM, while other\nmethods use LLM to predict linking results based on LM-generated\ncandidates. From Table 2, the “Before Prompting” method achieves\nthe worst accuracy, demonstrating that linking performance could\nbe improved by using LLM. Notably, PromptLinkwith both two-\nstage prompts achieves the best accuracy with the second-highest\ncost (∼1.7M total tokens, costing approximately $66.25), indicating\nthat the combined effect of the prompts substantially enhances accu-\nracy, with the costs being moderated by the first stage’s proficiency\nin eliminating unrelated candidates.\nNIL Prediction. Another ablation study examines PromptLink’s\nNIL prediction ability. In our built MIID and CISE datasets, each\nquery EHR concept 𝑚𝑖 is designed to have a ground-truth linking\nKG concept 𝑐𝑗. To reflect the real-world unlinkable scenario, we ex-\ntend our MIID dataset into “MIID-NIL” which contains a proportion\n(25%) of unlikable EHR concept𝑚𝑖. In Figure 3, the overall accuracy\nof PromptLink in the MIID-NIL dataset is 0.8145. Specifically for the\nunlikable concepts, PromptLink outputs the expected “NIL” with\n0.9290 accuracy, which validates the NIL prediction ability of our\nproposed method. Existing methods highly rely on the hard-coded\nthreshold. For example, we could threshold SAPBERT’s generated\nembeddings’ cosine similarity, then output the KG concept with\nthe highest similarity above the threshold or “NIL” when none are\nabove. However, this straightforward idea, requiring a manually\nset threshold, is less effective than PromptLink. As shown in Figure\n3, SAPBERT achieves lower accuracy (maximum value 0.7920) no\nmatter what the threshold value is, which corresponds to our as-\nsumptions. When the threshold value is low, SAPBERT generates\nmany wrong predictions to unlinkable query concepts; otherwise,\nSAPBERT continues to output “NIL” for many linkable concepts.\nFigure 3: Accuracy on\nMIID-NIL: Traditional ML-\nbased methods outputting\nmatching scores have varying\nNIL prediction performance\nbased on the selected thresh-\nold, while PromptLink does\nnot need a threshold yet\nconsistently performs better.\n3.4 Case Studies\nIn case studies on linking EHR concepts to MIID’s KG disease con-\ncepts, three scenarios are presented: (1) concepts assessed by both\nground-truth labels and a clinician; (2) concepts evaluated by a\nclinician due to missing ground-truth labels; (3) irrelevant concepts\njudged by a clinician. The linking results of PromptLink and SAP-\nBERT are presented in Table 3. Overall, PromptLink could link\nbiomedical concepts more accurately and appropriately. For casse\nI-V, PromptLink’s linking results are justified by the ground-truth\nPromptLink: Leveraging Large Language Models for Cross-Source Biomedical Concept Linking SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA.\nlabel and clinician. Specifically, for cases I and II, PromptLink accu-\nrately links the EHR concepts to conceptually similar but lexically\ndistinct KG concepts, while SAPBERT links to lexically similar but\nconceptually different KG concepts. This difference showcases the\neffective use of LLM’s biomedical knowledge. SAPBERT also shows\ninaccuracies in cases III-IV, and provides a broader prediction in\ncase V, whereas PromptLink’s predictions are more accurate and\nspecific. For cases VI-IX, where linking ground truth labels are\nlacking, PromptLink’s predictions also align more accurately with\nEHR concepts than SAPBERT’s, according to a clinician’s review.\nIn cases VI and VII, PromptLink closely matches the EHR concepts,\nwhile SAPBERT’s predictions are overly specific. In cases VIII and\nIX, PromptLink correctly and automatically identifies no match-\ning KG disease concepts, while SAPBERT fails to resolve that NIL\nprediction challenge unless manual thresholds are set and adjusted.\nTable 3: Analyzed cases.\nID EHR Concept PromptLink’s Prediction SAPBERT’s Prediction\nI Chondroectodermal dysplasia Ellis-van Creveld syndrome\nCranioectodermal dysplasia\nII Dermatophytosis of hand Tinea manuum\n Hand dermatosis\nIII Late syphilis, unspecified Tertiary syphilis\n Secondary syphilis\nIV Hypopotassemia Hypokalemia\n Hypocupremia nos\nV Epidemic vertigo Vestibular neuronitis\n Vertigo\nVI Postprocedural fever Postoperative complications\nPostcardiotomy syndrome\nVII Acquired cardiac septal defect Heart septal defect\nAtrial heart septal defect\nVIII Height of bed NIL\n Binge eating disorder\nIX Level one NIL\n Glaucoma 1 open angle\nNote: “\n ” indicates this prediction is justified by the clinician. “\n ” indicates this prediction is\njustified by the ground-truth label.\n4 Conclusion\nIn this study, we introduce PromptLink, a novel framework lever-\naging LLMs and multi-stage prompts for effective biomedical con-\ncept linking. Compared with previous concept linking methods,\nPromptLink achieves better linking accuracy, attributed to LLM’s\nintrinsic strong biomedical knowledge. PromptLink further em-\nploys multi-stage prompts to maintain cost-efficiency and handle\nthe NIL prediction problem. Moreover, PromptLink functions as\na zero-shot framework, requiring no training and demonstrating\nstrong flexibility and generalizability across biomedical systems.\nPromising future work can focus on further enhancing the prompt\neffectiveness, reducing costs, and minimizing manual efforts, aim-\ning to extend PromptLink’s application to broader systems.\nAcknowledgements\nResearch reported in this publication was partially supported by\nthe National Institute Of Diabetes And Digestive And Kidney Dis-\neases of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number\nK25DK135913.
