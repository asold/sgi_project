For this\nreason, parent-child interaction is crucial in the overall cognitive\narXiv:2201.04990v1  [cs.LG]  12 Jan 2022\nICMI ’21, October 18–22, 2021, Montréal, QC, Canada Junseok Park, Kwanyoung Park, Hyunseok Oh, Ganghun Lee, Minsu Lee, Youngki Lee, and Byoung-Tak Zhang\ndevelopment process, including linguistics and object understand-\ning [28]. Adequate supervision in the early stages of learning is\nalso important for machine learning (ML), as the sample efficiency\nof supervised learning is in general much higher than that of un-\nsupervised approaches [26]. Prior works have investigated diverse\nforms of guided learning on ML agents such as distillation [2], im-\nitation learning, weakly-supervised RL [ 23]. However, there has\nbeen limited cross-domain research to find an optimal guidance\nstrategy for a given task.\nIn this work, we are inspired by the concept of critical periods\nin the infant-toddler learning, a specific period in which the acqui-\nsition of language and visual/auditory processing capabilities are\nhighly accelerated [10, 16, 21, 22, 34, 40, 41], and we explore the\nquestion, \"does such a critical period also exist for machine learning\n(ML) agents?\". In particular, we aim to identify the optimal guidance\nduring training on a certain task, and study the correspondence\nbetween the optimal duration of guidance in ML algorithms and the\ncritical period in human learning. This study is significant in that\nthe optimal guidance strategy for a task can significantly enhance\nthe training efficiency of the ML model.\nTo this end, we define and empirically study the optimal initial\ntime of mentor guidance as the counterpart of the critical period\nin AI agents. To do this we formulate a reward structure that is\nvariable through the training iterations, in terms of the Partially\nObservable Markov Decision Process(POMDP) in RL framework.\nWe then formalize mentor guidance as a policy-invariant mutable\nreward structure on a given task. Finally, we formally define the\noptimal initial time of mentor guidance, and study it as the AI\nagent’s equivalent to the critical period seen in toddlers.\nOur key finding from experiments is that reinforcement learn-\ning agents indeed have a critical period much like toddlers in the\nmoderate guidance learning setting. To demonstrate this, we have\nimplemented guidance inside the VECA [29] virtual environment in\na multimodal agent RL framework to model mentor guidance. First,\nwe have modeled learning-through-play of toddlers with an object\nnavigation RL task using VECA. Second, we introduce the EAVE\ndataset, a real-world image and audio dataset accurately reflecting\nthe toddler’s point of view. For our experiments, we have imposed\nthree levels of guidance as seen in Fig 2: weak-mentor guidance\n(sparse reward), moderate mentor guidance (helper-reward), and\nmentor demonstration (behavioral cloning) and we adjust these\nguidances and their duration to find the best-performing setting.\nOur studies on unimodal and multi-modal RL agents show that the\ncritical period has appeared only when the toddler agent has mod-\nerate guidance while learning. Moreover, we validate our results\nusing the EAVE dataset via transfer learning. Results confirm that\nthe models trained on their appropriate critical period (1M&2M\niterations) noticeably outperform the models trained after (3M&4M\niterations) their critical period.\nTo summarize, this paper’s contributions are threefold:\n•We use a policy-invariant mutable reward structure to for-\nmulate the human toddler’s critical period in an ML model,\nespecially the multimodal humanoid RL agent we developed.\n•We construct a multimodal Navigation RL task and a real-\nworld EAVE dataset that can effectively demonstrate the\ncritical period in a multimodal RL agent.\nFigure 2: Three types of guidance. (a) Weak-Mentor Guid-\nance (green) and Moderate-Mentor Guidance (blue) use a re-\nward bonus method based on RL. (b) Mentor demonstration\n(red) use behavioral cloning (Imitation Learning)\n•We empirically study the critical period in a unimodal and\nmultimodal RL task with four different periods: 1/2/3/4 mil-\nlion training iterations. Agent trained in a critical period\noutperforms others significantly with proper guidance. Fur-\nthermore, the performance advantage transfers well to the\nreal-world downstream task.\n2 RELATED WORKS\nCurriculum Learning [4, 9, 31, 37, 44, 50] is an easy-to-hard train-\ning strategy in ML that gradually increases the complexity of the\ndata samples used during the training process [43]. Humans learn\nthe easy and preliminary concepts sooner and the difficult and ad-\nvanced concepts later. Moreover, humans learn much better when\nthe examples are not randomly presented but are organized in a\nmeaningful order [13, 43]. Curriculum learning applies a similar\nstrategy for ML model training, and achieves two major advantages:\nfaster convergence and better performance. There is a number of\ndomains including face recognition [24], object segmentation [55]\nand reinforcement learning [46] in which curriculum learning has\nbeen successfully applied. However, using curriculum learning does\nnot always benefit performance. It requires careful design of the\ndifficulty hierarchy before training. For instance, the diversity of the\ndata samples may be restricted if the task difficulty measure prefers\nchoosing easy examples only from a small subset of classes [42, 43].\nAn approach diametrical to easy-to-hard curriculum learning, that\nis emphasizing harder examples as in hard example mining [18, 39]\nor anti-curriculum learning [7, 32], can achieve improved results\nin some cases.\nML researchers have recently taken interest in ideas from child\nlearning further technical advances [ 3, 36, 49, 51, 52]. Learning\nproperly in a child stage is crucial for learning-to-learn capabilities\nlike goal-setting and self-control [48, 56]. Life experiences and prior\nknowledge learned in one’s childhood are known to influence adult\nlearning as well. The latest works in deep learning like visual object\nlearning [3] are inspired by the way children learn. Achille et al. [1]\nis the first work to show that deep artificial neural networks also\nexhibit critical periods like humans, a decisive time window for the\npost-natal developmental stage. In deep neural network training, a\nrapid growth in information is followed by a reduction of informa-\ntion from an analysis with Fisher Information. Unfortunately, their\nanalysis is limited to supervised learning in convolution neural\nToddler-Guidance Learning: Impacts of Critical Period on Multimodal AI Agents ICMI ’21, October 18–22, 2021, Montréal, QC, Canada\nnetworks (CNNs), and not executed on either RL or multimodal\nsetup. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt\nto apply the toddler’s developmental characteristic of humans to\neffective RL training. We aim to understand how the functionality\nand learning-to-learn capabilities are nurtured through appropriate\nsupervision.\nSeveral works in developmental psychology note that more guid-\nance does not mean better human development. A general under-\nstanding of objects develops in an early stage of toddler learn-\ning with weak supervision as well as through interactions like\nmouthing, chewing, and rotating [14, 33]. Furthermore, teaching\nformal subjects too early for a child is counterproductive in the\nlong run [45]. Inspired by human toddler learning, we conjecture\nthat there is also a form of optimal supervision and an optimal\ntime period for RL training of intelligent machines. We empirically\nsearch for a type of guidance that accelerates the training, but does\nnot change the optimal policy of the environment.\n3 METHOD\nReinforcement Learning. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a frame-\nwork for experience-driven autonomous learning [46] in which an\nagent interacts with the environment to learn optimal behaviour,\nimproving over time through trial and error [2]. Upon observing\nthe consequent state, an agent learns to alter its policy in response\nto received rewards. The environment in RL is typically assumed\nto be a Markov Decision Process (MDP). MDP is memoryless; the\nconditional probability of the next state and reward are stochasti-\ncally determined only from the current state and action, and do not\ndepend on the past [38].\n3.1 Guidance in a POMDP\nIn social psychology, a social behavior or social action is a behav-\nior that affects the other person and provokes a response [17, 47].\nA general social interaction sequence is defined as a sequence of\na person acting toward another (under the expectation), and the\nother acting towards the person in response (under the interpre-\ntation) [11]. Guided learning, or mentor guidance , can be defined\nas a process in which learners achieve their learning goal with the\nsupervision of a more experienced mentor [5].\nInspired by these psychological discoveries, we formalize the\nnotion of Guidance in the context of Partially Observable Markov\nDecision Process (POMDP). We find it analogous of a person as an\nagent, and an effect of the behavior as a change in the observation.\nPartially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) extend\nRL frameworks so that an agent observes only part of the world\nstate [12]. A POMDP is a 7-tuple ⟨𝑆,𝐴,𝑇,𝑅, Ω,𝑂,𝛾 ⟩consisting of:\n𝑆, a set of possible states; 𝐴, a set of actions; 𝑇, a set of transition\nprobabilities; 𝑅, a reward function 𝑅(𝑠,𝑎)for a state 𝑠 and action 𝑎;\nΩ, a set of possible observations,𝑂, a set of observation probabilities\n𝑜(𝑠,𝑎)= 𝑃𝑟(𝑜|𝑎,𝑠)for given state 𝑠 and action 𝑎; and 𝛾 a discount\nfactor. We extend this to include a no-op action (do nothing) in the\naction space as 𝐴′= 𝐴Ð{𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑝}.\n3.1.1 Mutable Reward Structure. Mutable reward structure is a\nreward function that is variable under number of iterations. Since\nMDP is memoryless, the state should incorporate the number of\ntraining iteration as a reference. Suppose the state consists of (𝑠,𝑡)\nwhere 𝑡 ∈N is the training iteration. The reward structure ˜𝑅 is\nmutable if such state 𝑠 ∈𝑆, action 𝑎 ∈𝐴exists.\n˜𝑅((𝑠,𝑡),𝑎)≠ ˜𝑅((𝑠,𝑡 +1),𝑎) (1)\nThe mutable reward structure is dependent on the past, so the prop-\nerties under the MDP do not hold anymore. However, the policy\nis invariant [ 27] if two MDPs become graph-isomorphic after a\npositive linear transformation 𝑓 : R →R is applied between corre-\nsponding weights. Policy invariance also holds when the reward\nstructure is a potential-based shaping function. Reward structure\nmorphing to a policy-invariant MDP preserves the optimal policy,\nand the value of the current policy. We further define such reward\nfunction as a policy-invariant mutable reward structure.\n3.1.2 Mentor Guidance. Mentor guidance can be interpreted as a\npolicy-invariant mutable reward structure that efficiently trains\nthe learner (mentee). Parent-child interaction, one of the major\nmentor guidance in human, is a special form of interaction which\nestablishes a strong bond between the parent and the child and\ngreatly facilitates the cognitive development of a child [ 28]. The\nparent agent observes the child’s state and has interactions with\nthe child to optimize the child’s ability on various tasks. It shows\nthat continuous care and guidance of mentor can hugely facillitate\nthe mentee’s performance. Motivated by it, we investigate a specific\ncase of policy-invariant mutable reward structure, e.g. helper re-\nward, aiming to optimize the learner’s performance. We also study\nthe behavior cloning, a mutable reward structure that the policy\ninvariance is not known. The guidance 𝐺𝑇 on a task 𝑇 is defined as\na reward structure 𝐺𝑇 = ˜𝑅𝑇(𝑠,𝑎)where 𝑠 ∈𝑆, 𝑎 ∈𝐴with agents\nperformance metric as 𝐽𝑇.\n3.2 Critical Period\nCritical periods are maturational stages in the lifespan of humans\nthat act as decisive period of learning in a particular learning do-\nmain as human grow up [16]. The critical period for the develop-\nment of the human visual system is considered to be between three\nand eight months [34]. Other critical periods have also been identi-\nfied for the development of hearing and the vestibular system [6, 21].\nBesides, critical periods for language acquisition indicate that the\nfirst few years of life constitute the time during which language\ndevelops readily, and after which language acquisition is much\nmore difficult. [40] To sum up, critical period stands for the effec-\ntive initiation time for supervising the cognitive development after\nbirth. We can see the correspondence between the critical period\nof a toddler and the morphing of a reward structure. In this work,\nwe seek the critical period of an ML agent. We empirically search\nwhether the initial morphing period of best guidance is finite, and\ncan be reached in a reasonable number of training iterations.\n3.3 Optimal Guidance as a Critical Period\n3.3.1 Initial Time of Guidance. For human, the parent’s guidance\ninitiates from the beginning of the child’s life. For the machine\nintelligence however, the guidance should persist only for a certain\nperiod for a learner to solve the task and learn on their own. We\nmodel this characteristic to the RL setting. Given the guidance, the\nreward morphing starts from an initial time 𝑡𝐺 and continues only\nfor a certain amount of time. The guidance resets from this point on.\nICMI ’21, October 18–22, 2021, Montréal, QC, Canada Junseok Park, Kwanyoung Park, Hyunseok Oh, Ganghun Lee, Minsu Lee, Youngki Lee, and Byoung-Tak Zhang\nObject Finding Query\n(One-Hot Encoding)\n(b) Transfer Learning\nImage Classification\n“Teddy Bear”\nReal-World Observation\nLinear Regression\nInteraction\nFeature Maps\n3136\n256\n84\n84\n6\n20\n2032\n99\n64\n7\n64\n8\n8\n44\n3\n7\nCNNs\nMLP\n⋰ ⋰\n⋰\n(a) Training Process\nLinear proj.\nMasking \n𝜋 𝑎 𝑠\n𝑄(𝑠,𝑎)\n7\n3136 256\nCNNs\nMLP\nInteraction\nFeature Maps\nVECA Visual Observation\n(Binocular Eyesight)\n84\n84\n6\n20\n20\n32\n7\n64\n8 8\n4\n4 3\n7\n9\n9\n64\n3\n500 256\nMLP\nRight-Ear HRTF\nFlatten\n𝑅∈500\nLeft-Ear HRTF\n250\n250\n1\n1\n𝐿𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑐\n𝐿𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟\nMLP\n512 512\nRight-Eye(RGB channel)\n512 256 5\nVECA  Audio \nObservation\n(3D spatialized audio)\n512\n1\nLeft-Eye(RGB channel)\nFigure 3: Architecture of the baby agent.

These feature maps are concatenated and linearly combined to make\nan interaction feature map. It is masked with a linearly projected object embedding and fed to an MLP, which outputs the\nQ-function 𝑄(𝑠,𝑎)and movement policy 𝜋(𝑎|𝑠). (b) We validate helper models in another relevant task via transfer learning\nWe denote the initial morphing time of the guidance as 𝑡𝐺. So for a\nseries of learning episodes{𝐸𝐺\n𝑖 }with guidance𝐺and their duration\n{𝑡𝑖}, the time interval of guidance lies in[𝑡𝐺,𝑡𝐺+Í\n𝑖𝑡𝑖]. This raises\nthe question: What is the optimal initial period of guidance for the\nlearner’s performance?\n3.3.2 Optimal Guidance. We can define an optimal guidance policy\non a set of guidance reward structures{𝐺𝑗}as the one which results\nin the best performance with their optimal initial morphing time.\nSuppose the 𝐽𝑇(𝜋𝜃)is the performance of policy parameter 𝜃 on\ntask 𝑇, and Pr(𝜃|𝐺,𝑡𝐺)is a trained policy distribution under the\nguidance 𝑅 = 𝐺 ∈{𝐺𝑗}and its duration 𝑡𝐺. The optimal guidance\ncan be defined as the guidance and its initial morphing period tuple\n(𝐺∗,𝑡∗\n𝐺)providing the best performance on a specific task 𝑇.\n(𝐺∗,𝑡∗\n𝐺)= arg max\n𝐺,𝑡𝐺\n\u0012\nmax\n𝜃∼𝑃𝑟(𝜃|𝐺,𝑡𝐺)\nE𝜋𝜃\n\u0000𝐽𝑇(𝜋𝜃)\u0001\u0013\n(2)\n3.4 Transfer Learning\nTransfer learning aims to help improve learning of some task in\nthe target domain using knowledge learned from the source do-\nmain [53]. Transfer learning is used for few-shot learning on new\ndatasets or in previously unseen domains both to reduce training\neffort and to transfer some of the knowledge and inductive biases\nacquired during training in the source domain. One recent work\nmodeled learning-through-play of a toddler by training a Deep\nNeural Network (DNN) model in a RL framework and transfer this\nmodel to a different domain to evaluate it in terms of visual object\nunderstanding [30]. They aim to acquire a general understanding\nof objects by exploring the environment and actively interacting\nwith the objects, as a toddler does.\nHyperparameter Candidate values Optimal value\n𝛼 (entropy coefficient) {0.003, 0.01, 0.03} 0.01\nLearning rate {0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001} 0.0003\n𝛾 (discount factor) {0.95, 0.99} 0.99\nTable 1: Tuned hyperparameters used in SAC.\n4 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\n4.1 Implementation Details\nWe designed the architecture of the agent as seen in Fig. 3 (a) to\nlearn and store transferable knowledge. We used Soft Actor-Critic\n(SAC) [15] to train the agent. In particular, we used 8 workers and\nupdated the parameter per 256 steps with batch size 512 using the\nreplay buffer size of 20,000. Other important hyperparameters of\nSAC are tuned as shown in Table. 1.\nVisual observations of the agent are encoded using a Convolu-\ntional Neural Network (CNN) encoder and an Multi-Layer Percep-\ntron (MLP), resulting in interaction feature maps . These features\nare masked with a linearly embedded representation of the object\nand determine the action of the agent. Since the agent’s movement\nonly depends on masked features, the agent must learn to represent\nabstract features of its observation corresponding to the target ob-\nject. Then the visual feature extractor of the agent is transferred to\nthe EAVE dataset and learned with the Adam [19] gradient descent\noptimizer. We trained the network on a server with Ubuntu 18.04\nLTS, Xeon Gold 5128 Scalable CPU and six RTX3090 GPUs.\n4.2 Interactive Virtual Environment\nWe implemented an interactive virtual environment supporting\ntoddler-like visual observations and active physical interaction\nwith objects, to train and evaluate guidance on different levels\nToddler-Guidance Learning: Impacts of Critical Period on Multimodal AI Agents ICMI ’21, October 18–22, 2021, Montréal, QC, Canada\nFigure 4: VECA engine characteristics. Unlike other existing\nRL environments, we trained the toddler AI agents in a set-\nting endowed with various human features and characteris-\ntics (e.g. binocular vision).\nand for different durations. We used VECA toolkit [29], a virtual\nenvironment generation toolkit for human-like agents, to build the\ntoddler-guidance learning environment. In particular, we leveraged\na toddler AI agent to be a humanoid avatar including several human\ncharacteristics: 1) binocular vision, 2) 3D spatialized audio, 3) mesh-\nbased tactiles, 4) joint-level physics, 5) objective interaction, and\na 6) realistic collider as seen in Fig. 4. The concept of the critical\nperiod was founded on human learning. Therefore, we believe that\na humanoid agent is able to more precisely learn from observations\nthan most of the existing RL environment agents, which don’t\nreflect the human features for testing the critical period [8, 20, 35,\n54]. The agent’s goal is to learn the ability to visually locate distant\nobjects, which are the same 10 objects as in the EAVE real-world\ndataset seen in Fig. 5 (b), while freely exploring and observing\nnearby objects as seen in Fig 6 (b) and (c). The environment’s\nreward structure is modified to implement the different levels and\ndurations of guidance. We aim to observe the influence of guidance\non establishing a profound visual understanding of an object during\nthe RL stage.\n4.3 EAVE Dataset Collection\nWe have collected an Egocentric Audio-Visual Exploration Dataset\nfor Unsupervised Alignment Learning (EAVE dataset) in order to\napproximate everyday images observed by toddlers. Most existing\nvisual image datasets [25] do not take into account how humans\nactually perceive the input, meaning their “first-person” perspective,\nthus they cannot fully capture the features of real human-visual\ninput. In particular, the way toddlers perceive the world has two\nmain unique aspects: 1) in the input observed by toddlers objects\noccupy a relatively larger size compared to an adult’s view of the\nscene (so the image has a much higher resolution); 2) the world is\nobserved by toddlers from a larger variety of different angles than by\nadults [3]. To complement the aforementioned characteristics of the\ntoddler’s point of view, we used 10 toys in red, green and blue (for\na total of 30 objects) as can be seen in Fig. 5 (a) and collected 30,000\nimages using a depth camera. Because toddlers do not typically\nsee only a single object in real-world environments, each image\nincludes three objects much like the “real-world observations” from\nFig. 5 (a). We are attempting to collect the image perspectives by\nassuming the baby’s point of view from a variety of angles Fig. 5 (c).\nFigure 5: (a) Example of visual images with bounding boxes\nand the 10 objects used in the EAVE dataset, (b) The same\n10 objects in the Virtual Environment (VECA), (c) The EAVE\nvisual dataset includes egocentric images from the toddler’s\nPOV at various angles.\nMoreover, each image has one main object which has the baby’s\nattention. For each image, we label the bounding box information\nof the three objects and the main object such that it is possible to\ncrop each object individually as a single-object image. Note that\nthe EAVE dataset is only used for transfer learning experiments in\nthe Study 3.\nFigure 6: Various viewpoints of our 3D environment. (a)\nDeveloped 3D-toddler playroom Environment top view, (b)\nThird-person point of view, (c) First-person point of view of\na toddler agent while learning the objects.\n4.4 Study 1: Examining the impact of the level\nof interaction in unimodal learning\nThe purpose of study1 is to compare the performance of the agent\nin a visual (unimodal) environment trained with various start times\n(for a fixed duration of guidance) and mutual interaction in the\nform of guidance, and find if there exists a critical period for each\nmutual interaction. To observe the effect of mutual interaction, we\ndesigned the procedure of the experiment as shown in the left side\nof Fig. 3. We first trained the agent for 1/2/3/4 million frames only\nwith sparse rewards. For each pre-trained agent, we then continued\ntraining the agent with guidance (helper-reward, behavior cloning)\nor without guidance for 2 million frames as seen in Fig 1.\nICMI ’21, October 18–22, 2021, Montréal, QC, Canada Junseok Park, Kwanyoung Park, Hyunseok Oh, Ganghun Lee, Minsu Lee, Youngki Lee, and Byoung-Tak Zhang\nFigure 7: Performance of the agents during the guidance. Vertical axis indicates the average reward while the gray dotted\nline indicates average reward of the ideal policy (0.069/0.028 and 0.077/0.031 for unimodal and multimodal environment\nwith/without helper reward). Horizontal axis indicates the number of frames that the guidance is provided. Agents guided\nwith helper-reward show a remarkable difference in the performance. Agents guided with behavior-cloning improves, but the\ndifference is negligible. Without guidance, agents fail to improve. For helper-reward in multi-modal environment, we used\ntwo seeds to ensure that the result is not by the randomness of training. For other experiments, we used single seed.\n4.4.1 Task Design. We designed an object-finding task to train the\nagent in the virtual environment. We used the VECA [29] toolkit to\nimplement and built up an interactive 3D environment that includes\nten objects (of the same categories as in the EAVE dataset) and a\nbaby agent. For each episode, two objects are colored randomly (in\nred, green, blue) and randomly placed with the agent in the square\nroom with length of 18 units, with the distance of at least 4 units\nfor each other as seen in Fig 6 (a). The agent receives the reward\n+1 for reaching the target object, and receives -1 for reaching the\nwrong object. We say that the agent reached the object if the agent\nis looking towards the object and the distance is less than 2.5 units.\nNote that the distance is necessary because the object, which is on\nthe floor, will disappear from the eyesight if it gets closer since the\nagent can’t move its head vertically. The maximum length of each\nepisode is 256. The agent receives RGB 84x84 binocular vision and\nreceives the information about the target object as a 10-dimensional\none-hot vector. The agent can walk around the environment with\nmaximum speed of 0.33 units per frame, which is represented by\ntwo continuous action variables 𝑎𝑓 (within [0, 1], forward walking\nspeed) and 𝑎𝑟 (within [-1, 1], direction of walking).\nPlease note that this task is not easy to solve with SAC without\nguidance. First, random (maximum-entropy) actions in this envi-\nronment are likely to lead the agent to head into the wall, which\nfills most of the replay buffer with unhelpful data. Moreover, the\nagent has to learn color- and perspective-independent features of\nthe object since the object is placed and colored randomly. Also, the\npresence of a wrong object requires the agent not only to navigate\nto the target object, but also to avoid the wrong object.\nThis reward function (3) encourages the agent to look towards\nthe object, visually recognize it, and move towards the object.\n4.4.2 Design of guidance. For moderate mentor guidance, we gave\nthe agent helper reward formulated as follows:\n𝑟\n′\n=\n \n\n−0.03𝑎𝑓 If target is out of eyesight\n0.05𝑎𝑟 +0.03𝑎𝑓 If target is left of eyesight\n−0.05𝑎𝑟 +0.03𝑎𝑓 If target is right of eyesight\n(3)\nFor mentor demonstration, we set the mentor’s policy according\nto its visual information. In particular, if the target object is out of\neyesight then the agent turns right to find the object. If the target\nobject is in its eyesight then the agent walks forward and turns\nslightly left/right if the object is on the right/left side of eyesight.\n4.4.3 Results. For guidance from helper-rewards, we found that\nthere exists a noticeable difference in performance depending on\nthe time from which the guidance is provided as shown in Fig.\n7(1)(a). For convenience, we denote 𝑛M-helper as the model that is\ntrained with helper reward guidance starting from𝑛million frames.\nIn detail, the 2M-helper had much higher average reward (0.03) than\nthe other agents (0.00/-0.01/-0.01 for 1M/3M/4M). This shows that\na critical regime indeed exists for guidance from helper-rewards in\nthe object-finding task. Note that for guidance from helper-rewards,\nhelper reward is included when calculating the reward plotted in\nFig. 7(1)(a) so the reward is negative on the early stage. Fig. 8(1)(a)\ncompares the trajectories of the agents, visually showing that the\npolicy of the 2M-helper performs better than the other agents.\nToddler-Guidance Learning: Impacts of Critical Period on Multimodal AI Agents ICMI ’21, October 18–22, 2021, Montréal, QC, Canada\nFigure 8: Visualization of the trajectory for each agent’s policy in unimodal and multimodal environments. Blue dots represent\nstarting points of the agents. Green/red dots and circles represent the target/wrong object and the boundary for reaching it\nrespectively. Note that the agent has to get inside the boundary and also face towards the object to clear the task.\nHowever, we found that there was no remarkable difference\nbetween the performance for behavior-cloning. As shown in Fig.\n7(1)(b), the average rewards are similar (around 0.01) for all agents.\nThese agents learned how to navigate to the target object, but could\nnot learn how to avoid the wrong object as shown in Fig. 8(1)(b).\nWithout guidance, the agent was unable to learn to solve the\ntask properly as shown in Fig. 7(1)(c) and Fig. 8(1)(c). Compared to\nthe results with guidance, these experiments show that guidance\ndoes aid in the agents’ learning process.\n4.5 Study 2: Examining the impact of the level\nof interaction in multimodal learning\nThe purpose of study2 is to examine the effect of interaction in\na multimodal environment and observe how the modality of the\nagent affected its performance and the critical period. To do so,\nwe modified the object-finding task in Study 1 to an audio-visual\ntask. Specifically, each object has its unique sound and makes this\nsound during the whole episode. Since the audio observation of the\nagent is 3D-spatialized, the agent can recognize the direction of\neach sound source. Thus, we expect that this task would be easier\nthan Study 1, but still challenging since the agent has to learn the\nrelation between the object and the sound. Other detailed setups\nabout the learning process and guidance are identical to Study 1.\n4.5.1 Results. Similar to Study 1, we find that there exists a notice-\nable difference in performance for guidance from helper-rewards,\nas shown in Fig. 7(2)(a). This shows that a critical regime also exists\nfor guidance from helper-rewards in the multimodal object-finding\ntask. However, the critical regime differed from Study 1: the 1M-\nand 2M-helper had much higher average reward (0.046 and 0.050)\nthan 3M-(0.02), 4M-(0.02) agents. Fig. 8(2)(a) compares the trajecto-\nries of the agents, visually showing that the policy of the 1M- and\n2M-helper performs better than the other agents. We observed that\nthe agent majorly uses the audio to get the direction of the object,\nso it turns right/left even if the object is slightly left/right, which\nresults in wiggling behavior.\nThe agents guided with behavior-cloning had only a negligible\ndifference in performance as shown in Fig. 7(2)(b). These agents\nshowed behavior similar to the agents in Study 1: they learned to\nnavigate to the target object but didn’t learn to avoid the wrong\nobject as shown in Fig. 8(2)(b). However, the average reward was\nlower than in the unimodal environment. We think that because\nthe target policy is only based on visual observation, so the audio\nobservation worked as noise during behavior cloning.\nWithout guidance, the agent couldn’t solve the task properly as\nshown in Fig. 7(2)(c) and Fig. 8(2)(c). These results show that the\nmulti-modality of the agent didn’t give rise to a new critical period\nfor guidance methods without critical regime, but affected the time\nof critical period of the guidance with a critical regime.\n4.6 Study 3: Transfer to a real-world dataset\nIn study1, we trained with three levels of guidance learning (Sparse-\nreward, helper-reward, and behavioral cloning) Fig. 2. This leads\nto three distinct sets of CNN and MLP weights from the trained\nmodels, and we can evaluate each of these sets of weights in another\nrelevant task via transfer learning as seen in Fig. 3 (b).\nWe previously observed that the 2M- and 1M-helper models\nshowed a noticeable difference in performance compared to the\nmodels with no critical period (3M-, 4M-helper) on both uni- and\nmultimodal AI agents. If such a disparity in performance is valid, we\nbelieve that the models pre-trained with helper-reward guidance\nshould show comparable results on real-world data input which\nbetter reflects the characteristics of toddlers’ observations.\nTo verify the validity of our claims, we evaluated the transfer\nperformance of image encoders (consisting of the CNN and the\nMLP) from 1M-, 2M-, 3M-, and 4M-helper models. Specifically, we\nfixed the parameters of the image encoders after pre-training and\nconnected additional linear layers for image classification. Next,\nwe used the EAVE dataset images, which was collected in the real\nworld in accordance with the toddler’s viewpoint, as input (size\n84x84) with a total of 6 channels, consisting of the toddler agent’s\nICMI ’21, October 18–22, 2021, Montréal, QC, Canada Junseok Park, Kwanyoung Park, Hyunseok Oh, Ganghun Lee, Minsu Lee, Youngki Lee, and Byoung-Tak Zhang\nFigure 9: Transfer learning performance with the moderate\nguidance learning (helper-reward) using the EAVE dataset\non unimodal (1) and multimodal (2) agents.\nbinocular vision with RGB channels each to the right and left side.\nWe trained the model for 500 000 iterations with batch size 32.\nAs shown in Fig. 9, we found that the transferred 2M- ( Uni:64.6/\nMulti:65.8%) and 1M-helper ( Uni:64/Multi:64.9%) models with a crit-\nical period achieved a better performance in terms of accuracy than\nthe 3M- (Uni:63.3/multi:64.9%) and 4M-helper ( Uni:62.1/multi:64.2%)\nmodels without a critical period on the EAVE dataset. The multi-\nmodal agent’s set of CNN and MLP weights has shown a much\nhigher average accuracy than the unimodal agent. Hence, we con-\nfirm that multimodal learning rather than unimodal can be helpful\nin efficiently learning the representation of objects during learning.\nFurthermore, similar to study1 (see Fig. 7 (1),(2)-(a)). we see a dis-\ntinct difference in moderate guidance learning performance with\na helper-reward and can accordingly rank the models in the same\norder where the models (2M,1M) with a critical period significantly\noutperform the ones without. Through this, we validate that the\nlearning performance of toddler AI agents indeed depends on the\ncritical period for the setting with moderate guidance learning.\n5 DISCUSSIONS\nOur paper has made three key contributions as a first step toward\ndiscovering the optimal guidance corresponding to critical periods\nin AI agents. First, to prove that RL-based humanoid AI agents\nalso have critical periods like a toddler has, we found for the first\ntime that AI agents also show specific critical periods (2M, 1M-\nhelper) within the only moderate guidance learning setting (see\nFig. 7 (1),(2)-(a)). We assume that 3M/4M frames are past the critical\nperiod, so the policy overfits more to the sparse reward, unable to\nreach the performance of the 2M/1M model. Behavioral Cloning\nmerely imitates the mentor’s trajectory, unable to generalize beyond\nthe mentor-given policy. However, the helper reward is the optimal\nguidance among them.\nSecond, we collected the EAVE dataset, which contains images\nthat imitate a toddler’s point of view and its special characteristics\nand which, along with the developed virtual environment with\na humanoid agent, allowed us to verify the qualitative notion of\ncritical periods in a computational and cognitive way. Furthermore,\nwe specifically designed the agent as a humanoid agent, mimick-\ning the toddler’s viewpoint’s characteristics in VECA, so that a\nhumanoid agent can closely learn and more efficiently observe the\nfeatures of objects in the same way a toddler does. We believe that\nthose human-like learning features enable us to test and validate\nthe critical learning period more reliably.\nLastly, Our findings are especially significant for both Human-AI\ninteraction domain and Human-in-the-loop RL, possibly used to\ndetermine the best time for human intervention in the training of\nAI agents. We developed and designed both uni- and multimodal\nagents, and confirm that the multimodal agent achieves a consider-\nable improvement over every result of the unimodal agent, inspired\nby actual human cognitive development. The multimodal agent\nhas a higher average reward and accuracy on object-finding task (\nFig. 7 (2)-(a)) and transfer learning on the EAVE dataset (Fig. 9 (b)).\nWe validate that multimodal learning at 2M&1M accompanying the\ncritical period is more effective for learning useful representation\ncompared to the unimodal approach.\nIn the future, we aim to analyze the critical period based on a\nmore toddler-like RL algorithm deeper in the multi-task&meta-RL\ndomain or develop an algorithm that automatically finds the critical\nlearning period of the agent with additional verification studies.\nIn this work, however, we employed a conventional RL algorithm\nwith a light deep learning structure as a first step towards this goal.\nAlso, testing the generalizability of the critical period concept\nrequires further experiments. Since the concept is from humans,\nwe speculate that physically grounded humanoid agents will more\nlikely show critical periods here. We plan to study this in various\nenvironments including non-humanoid agent in the future.\n6 CONCLUSION\nToddlers usually have a distinctive increase in performance during\nthe critical period [34]. At this time, the increase in learning perfor-\nmance depends on the timing of mutual interaction. To investigate\na similar effect in learning in AI agents, we studied three levels\nof mutual interaction learning (forms of guidance) in the virtual\nenvironment based on our formulation of toddler guidance learning\nterms in the RL framework. We validated our observations of the\nmodel’s critical period on real-world observations (EAVE dataset).\nCorresponding to the critical period in toddlers, we observed a\nsimilar increase in performance using optimal guidance during the\ntraining of an AI agent. Specifically, we found that only moder-\nate mutual interaction with a multimodal agent leads to a distinct\nincrease in performance within the critical period and further af-\nfects the period during which the AI agent achieves remarkable\nperformance compared to the unimodal agent.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was partly supported by the IITP (2015-0-00310-SW.Star-\nLab/16%, 2017-0-01772-VTT/16%, 2018-0-00622-RMI/16%, 2019-0-\n01371-BabyMind/20%) grants and the NRF of Korea (2021R1A2C10-\n10970/16%) grant funded by the Korean government, and the CARAI\n(UD190031RD/16%) grant funded by the DAPA and ADD.\nToddler-Guidance Learning: Impacts of Critical Period on Multimodal AI Agents ICMI ’21, October 18–22, 2021, Montréal, QC, Canada\nREFERENCES\n[1] Alessandro Achille, Matteo Rovere, and Stefano Soatto. 2018.
