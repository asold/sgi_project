  "abstract": "The emergence of large language models has sparked discussion about their role in academic and scholarly publishing and whether their use poses threats to academic integrity. This paper argues for the ethical acceptance and integration of language models into the scholarly publishing process for the purposes of improving writing quality without the need for explicit acknowledgment or additional scrutiny, on the basis that this policy is critical for closing the equity gap for non-native English speakers and researchers from developing countries. Journal-wide policies are proposed that would allow the use of AI for revising writing quality, without singling out specific authors or articles, aligning with existing practices for language editing services, and ensuring confidentiality while promoting fairness and transparency in the publishing process. By removing artificial barriers to participation and acknowledging the diverse linguistic backgrounds of researchers, the scholarly ecosystem can advance toward greater equity and innovation.",
