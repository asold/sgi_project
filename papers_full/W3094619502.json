According to estimates, there are more\nthan 325,000 mHealth apps for the most popular mobile\nplatforms, iOS and Android [2]. Categories of mHealth products\nencompass monitoring, treatment, diagnosis, health professional\nsupport, well-being, health surveillance support, and health care\nadministration [3]. Although download indexes and apps in the\nmarket have increased in the last 5 years, clinicians, researchers,\nand patients remain skeptical about the reliability of the data\ngenerated [4]. These limitations have led to a lack of knowledge\nregarding the efficiency, efficacy, and safety associated with\nmobile app utilization in clinical practice. Furthermore, health\norganizations recommend making assessments before software\nimplementation to ensure safety and accurate data quality [5].\nUsability is an essential part of software development and is\ncommonly evaluated through questionnaires [4,6].\nQuestionnaires reflect users’ opinions and have the advantages\nof low cost, easy execution, and lack of necessary test\nequipment. Usability can be defined as the extent to which a\nproduct can be used by specific users to achieve specified goals\neffectively and efficiently while providing user satisfaction in\na specific context of use (user technology interface) [7]. Due to\nthe high demand for mHealth apps, usability evaluations are\ninsufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to implement a usability\nmetric that is context driven and standardized to efficiently\nassess clinically related software. There is no usability\nquestionnaire specifically designed for mHealth apps. Previous\nstudies have investigated usability models for mobile apps and\nhave also modified existing usability questionnaires for use in\nmobile app usability studies [8].\nThe System Usability Scale (SUS) proposed by Brooke [9] in\n1986 is a widely used questionnaire to assess the usability of a\nsystem, such as standard operating system–based software\ninterfaces, webpages, and mobile apps. It has been implemented\nin several mHealth fields, including mental health (n=12), cancer\n(n=10), nutrition (n=10), pediatrics (n=9), diabetes (n=9),\ntelemedicine (n=8), cardiovascular disease (n=6), HIV (n=4),\nsanitary information systems (n=4), and smoking (n=4) [2]. The\nSUS questionnaire has been translated into several languages,\nsuch as Portuguese [10], Indonesian [11], and more recently,\nMalay [12]. All translated versions have shown similar internal\nreliability compared with the original English version. Although\nthere is a Spanish version [13], there is no evidence of the\nvalidity and reliability process. Therefore, it is necessary to\nhave a Spanish version of the SUS that documents the validation\nprocess in order to guarantee the quality of the resulting\nquestionnaire. The objective of this study is to develop and\nvalidate a Spanish version of the original English SUS,\nguaranteeing conceptual, semantic, and contextual equivalence\nbetween both questionnaires.\nMethods\nSUS Scale\nThe SUS scale is a 10-item questionnaire scored on a 5-point\nLikert-type scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).\nIts advantages include versatility, simplicity, low cost, accuracy,\nand validity. Its reliability (Cronbach α=.85) has been reported\n[11,12,14-16]. The questionnaire is designed to be answered\nafter the user’s interaction with the system. It is arranged to\nalternate between positive and negative statements to avoid\nhabitual bias from the respondent. The score contribution for\nthe odd items (the positive statements) is the scale position\nminus 1 and the contribution for the even items (the negative\nstatements) is 5 minus the scale position. The overall score is\ncalculated from the sum of all item scores multiplied by 2.5,\nwith the overall score ranging from 0 to 100. A system with a\nscore above 85 is considered to have excellent usability, whereas\na system with a score between 68 and 84 is considered to have\ngood usability.\nTranslation\nThe original SUS questionnaire was translated into a new\nSpanish version using the methodology described by\nOrtiz-Gutiérrez and Cruz-Avelar [17], following the\ninternational guidelines proposed by the World Health\nOrganization [5] to ensure the semantic equivalence, quality,\nand consistency of meaning with the original version. The\nmethodology included 9 steps: (1) preparation, (2) forward\ntranslation, (3) synthesis, (4) back translation, (5) review of the\nback translation, (6) revision of the target language phrasing,\n(7) harmonization, (8) piloting, and (9) completion.\nFirst, for the preparation, we evaluated the measurement\nproperties of the original tool, identifying differences and\nsimilarities among them. The author’s permission was requested\nto work with the scale.\nSecond, to achieve the forward translation, the original version\nof the SUS was translated into Spanish by 2 independent\ntranslators with an adequate understanding of the source\nlanguage: one individual had a master’s degree in translation\nstudies and the other was a professional certified in English\nlanguage and linguistics whose native language was Spanish.\nEach of the 2 translators provided their own translated version\nin Spanish. The translators were blind regarding the usage of\nthe tool. Both translations were compared by the working group\nto combine them into one preliminary version.\nThird, the working group for the synthesis was composed of 5\nhealth professionals who were native Spanish speakers. Two\nof them were research coordinators, another held a master’s\ndegree in clinical epidemiology, and 2 had PhD degrees in\nclinical epidemiology. The team had knowledge and experience\nin clinical and epidemiological research. They compared both\ntranslations and adjusted them, focusing on semantic\nequivalence and language reliability, to obtain the first\nconsensual version.\nFourth, for the back translation, the first consensual version of\nthe new Spanish version of the SUS was translated into English\nby a native English speaker whose second language was Spanish\nJMIR Hum Factors 2020 | vol. 7 | iss. 4 | e21161 | p. 2http://humanfactors.jmir.org/2020/4/e21161/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSevilla-Gonzalez et alJMIR HUMAN FACTORS\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nto ensure its compatibility with the original English version.\nThe translator was blind to the final use of the translation. The\noutput was an English version of the SUS translated from the\npreliminary SUS Spanish version (Table S1 in Multimedia\nAppendix 1).\nFifth, we conducted the review of the back translation. The\nworking group compared the translation of the reconciled\nversion to the original version to assess the conceptual\nequivalence between the 2 versions.\nSixth, to achieve a revision of the target language phrasing, we\nrevised the semantic equivalence and worked to improve the\nphrasing of the new Spanish SUS version. In this step, we\nintentionally checked the presence of double-negative statements\nand the usage of words that are easily understandable by a\npopulation of different backgrounds and educational attainments.\nSeventh, for the harmonization step, all the translations produced\nduring the process were reviewed to detect possible\ndiscrepancies and to obtain the prefinal version.\nEighth, the pilot was planned following the methodology\ndescribed by Ortiz-Gutiérrez and Cruz-Avelar [17], ensuring\nsimilar and appropriate conditions for answering the\nquestionnaire. Target participants for the piloting were part of\na clinical trial that aimed to measure environmental exposure\nusing electronic tools that was taking place at the Unidad de\nInvestigación de Enfermedades Metabólicas at the Instituto\nNacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán in\nMexico City. All participants provided written informed consent,\nand the study was approved by the institution’s ethics\ncommittee. The study follows the principles of the Declaration\nof Helsinki.\nNinth, after the pilot data were collected, they were carefully\nanalyzed to detect time spent, possible questions that emerged\nfrom the participants over the process, and semantic\nunderstanding during the usage.\nValidation and Reliability Process\nThe SUS questionnaire was validated for content validity, face\nvalidity, and reliability. The method for quantifying content\nvalidity was the content validity index (CVI) [18], which is\nbased on expert relevance ratings. The questionnaire (Table S2\nin Multimedia Appendix 1) was given to 10 mobile app\ndeveloper experts, or computer system engineers who had been\nworking on mobile app development for at least 3 years. They\nwere asked to give a score from 1 (question not relevant to\nassess usability’s tool) to 4 (relevant question to assess\nusability’s tool) for the relevance of each item of the SUS\nquestionnaire to assess the usability of an electronic tool.\nAccording to the method, scores of 3 and 4 were recategorized\nas 1 (relevant) and scores of 1 and 2 were recategorized as 0\n(not relevant). The CVI was calculated for each item on the\nSUS questionnaire, and then the CVI average across items was\ncalculated.\nThe face validity index (FVI) aims to assess the clarity and\ncomprehensibility of the translated items. This was performed\nby 10 users, who were asked to give a score from 1 (item not\nclear and not understandable) to 4 (item very clear and\nunderstandable) to assess the clarity and comprehensibility of\nthe translated items of the SUS questionnaire. Scores of 3 and\n4 were recategorized as 1 (clear and understandable) and scores\nof 1 and 2 were recategorized as 0 (not clear or understandable)\n[18]. The FVI was calculated for each item on the SUS\nquestionnaire and then computed by calculating the scale\naverage.\nReliability testing was conducted with 88 respondents, based\non the minimum sample size estimation to assess internal\nconsistency. The sample size was computed according to the\nCronbach α estimation [19] by considering an α of .70 with a\nprecision of 0.10 and a 2-tailed significance level of .05 for 10\nitems. The sample size required was 82 participants. For the\nreliability testing, we invited participants aged 18 to 75 years\nwho had used Zoom (Zoom Video Communications) at least\ntwice over the last month. We selected Zoom because it is a\nwidely known application that can be used on different\nelectronic devices, such as cell phones, laptops, and tablets,\ncovering different modalities of a system. The respondents were\nasked to use the SUS to assess the usability of Zoom. All the\nsurveys were conducted using Google Forms. The URL was\nsent through WhatsApp to each participant.\nThe reliability analysis was computed using Cronbach α, a\nmeasure of internal consistency. A coefficient of .70 or higher\nis considered acceptable for internal reliability [20]. Statistical\nanalysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 21.0\nfor Macintosh (IBM Corp).\nResults\nAfter reviewing all translated versions, we re-evaluated the\ncomplete questionnaire to ensure the syntax and grammar had\nmeaning as a whole. In the back translation, the most important\ndifferences from the original version were the terms “technical\nperson” and “cumbersome,” since the literal translations in\nSpanish are different from the conceptual meaning. We\nconsidered it appropriate for this translation to use “personal\nexperto,” and “tedioso,” respectively. Likewise, the word\n“system” was changed to the Spanish words for “electronic\ntools,” namely “herramienta,” as this version attempts to\ndetermine the usability of mobile apps and websites. The output\nof this step was a preliminary version of the new Spanish SUS\nversion.\nThe pilot study was conducted with 10 users who answered the\nquestionnaire in person after using a website to record diet and\nexercise. The time spent to answer the questionnaire was 10 to\n12 minutes. The pilot data were carefully analyzed by the\nworking group. A total of 3 questions—numbers 2, 5, and\n9—were difficult to understand for most users due to the use\nof complex words. The misunderstood words were changed for\nsynonyms such as “funciones,” “compleja,” and “confiado,”\nwhich made the questionnaire easier to understand.\nThe output of the translation process was a questionnaire of 10\nitems in Spanish, equivalent to the SUS version in English, that\nmeasures the usability of electronic tools (Multimedia Appendix\n2).\nJMIR Hum Factors 2020 | vol. 7 | iss. 4 | e21161 | p. 3http://humanfactors.jmir.org/2020/4/e21161/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nSevilla-Gonzalez et alJMIR HUMAN FACTORS\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nThe CVI (Table 1) and FVI (Table 2) of the new Spanish version\nof the SUS were calculated to be 0.92 and 0.94, respectively.\nCVI and FVI scores above 0.80 for both tests indicates that all\nitems in the questionnaire are relevant to the domain, clear, and\ncomprehensible to experts and users.\nTable 1.

The results of the validation process\nindicate that the elements were easy to understand and there\nwere no semantic or content-related problems. The translated\nitems were considered equivalent to the original version;\ntherefore, the Spanish questionnaire is a reliable tool to assess\nthe usability of tools for Spanish-speaking users.\nSpanish is the native language of most countries in Latin\nAmerica and the second most widely spoken native language\nin the world, with more than 400 million speakers. In addition,\nit is important to develop multilingual strategies to assess each\nnew electronic tool for health research with a wide array of\nindividuals. Although there is a Spanish version of the SUS\nscale in existence, to our knowledge the translation process is\nnot documented and there is no information about its validity\nand reliability.\nSimilarly, some broad concepts of the first Spanish translation\nmake adaptation difficult for current mobile software and\nwebsites. With the advent of mobile apps and websites for\nresearch proposes in Spanish-speaking countries and around\nthe world, is necessary to develop tools with supporting local\nevidence to evaluate specifications of new devices to ensure the\ndata collected are accurate to the user. However, the\ndevelopment of new tools requires additional cost and time.\nTherefore, adapting available questionnaires into other languages\nand ensuring their validity is the best alternative.\nThe new SUS scale in Spanish will allow researchers and\nclinicians to evaluate a Spanish tool’s usability in an accurate,\npractical, and low-cost manner. In our study, the questionnaire\nwas proven to be easy to comprehend and apply.\nFor this study, we applied the methodology proposed by\nOrtiz-Gutiérrez and Cruz-Avelar [17], which is consistent with\nthe guidelines of the World Health Organization [5]. This\nmethodology was combined with the process reported by\nMohamad Marzuki et al [13] in 2018, who translated the same\ntool to Malay. Among the strengths of this methodology, the\nplanning of each of the steps of the process particularly\nenhanced the quality of the translation.\nOnly young adults were included in the study. Therefore, the\napplicability to other age ranges may be questioned. In addition,\nthe representativeness of the sample in reflecting the rest of\nLatin America may need further studies, as results might vary\nby region. Although only individuals of Mexico City were\nincluded, Mexico City constitutes an important representation\nof several states and regions of the country, including the south,\ncenter, east, and west coast of Mexico. This characteristic makes\nit appropriate to carry out representative studies when the\npossibility to extend them to several regions across the country\nis limited.\nIn conclusion, the new Spanish version of the SUS is a valid\nand reliable version of the original English version, adapted to\nbe used for electronic tools in clinical and health research\nsettings.\nAcknowledgments\nLML is a doctorate student of the Programa de Maestría y Doctorado en Ciencias de la Salud at the Universidad Nacional\nAutónoma de México.\nAuthors' Contributions\nMRSG conceived of the idea, determined the study design, and drafted the manuscript.
