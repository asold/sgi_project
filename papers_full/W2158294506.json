  "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to present a VRML exploration of the Erechtheum in Athens. It addresses the 4th grade students and it constitutes a teaching approach trough the use of various representations created with VRML language. The design principles of the applications are described in detail as well as the technical characteristics of the application. A pilot evaluation of the teaching approach is also presented and the results indicate a strong positive impact on studentsÃ¢ÂÂ performance. The application also aims to emphasize the significant advantages of VRML as an efficient way of offering ICT course materials to students.\\n\\n",
