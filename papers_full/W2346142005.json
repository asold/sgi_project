Such \nopposition is ostensibly articulated most strongly by populist parties, which can be seen as the \nultimate challengers to the (politica l) ‘elites’. By means of two often -identified cases of populism in \nthe Netherlands (the radical right Freedom Party and left -wing Socialist Party), this study explores \nhow populist party leaders use Twitter messages (tweets) to give form to their adversarial rhetoric in \npractice. Irrespective of the different ways in which the politicians utilised the medium, our study \nshows that Twitter can serve as a valuable source to study the oppositional discourse of populist \nparties, and (shifting) party strategies more generally.  \n \nKeywords \nPopulism; political parties; the Netherlands; Twitter; content analysis  \n \n \n \nTwitter has grown out to be one of the most prominent microblogging and social networking \nservices. For politicians, the medium provides a tool to engage in unmediated communication with a \nbroad group of potential voters (Lassen and Brown 2011). In practice, Twitter is regularly used by \npoliticians to voice their opinions, and tweets can be seen as typical vehicles for self -promotion \n(Golbeck et al. 2010). Even though a relatively small number of people ‘follow’ politicians on Twitter \ndirectly, tweets often lie at the basis of more widely consumed media coverage (see Larsson and \nMoe 2012; Jacobs and Spierings 2016). \nWhile Twitter allows for a more general a nalysis of party positions and political ideologies, the focus \nof this article is narrower, as we are interested in the manner in which the medium is used as a \nmeans of political opposition. Several authors have noted the suitability of social media for so -called \npopulist politicians, who are characterised by their appeal to the ‘ordinary’ people and hostility \ntowards the (political) elites (Bartlett et al. 2011; Gerbaudo 2015). Yet research on how populist \nparties give shape to their anti -establishment rhetoric through Twitter remains sparse. In our study, \nwe assess how leaders of two alleged populist parties at the ideological fringes of the Dutch political \nspectrum, Geert Wilders of the Freedom Party (Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV) and Emile Roemer of the \nSocialist Party (Socialistische Partij, SP), use Twitter to criticise their political opponents, and respond \nto changing political opportunities. Both these parties have habitually been associated with \npopulism, not least due to their critical attitude tow ards the Dutch political elite. In our analysis we \ntrace developments in the party leaders’ ‘adversarial tweets’; more specifically, we consider which \nactors they blamed over time, and which issues were at the centre of their adversarial tweets.  \nThe following sections outline in more detail our theoretical starting points. Subsequently, a brief \ndescription of the Socialist Party and Freedom Party is provided. The article then moves on to \npresent the research design and the results of this study. We find th at the frequency in which the \nparty leaders used Twitter has varied over time, but that the politicians’ adversarial tweets reflected \nwell their (electoral) strategies. They were selective in criticising particular opponents and shifted \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n596 \n \ntheir targets and ‘blame topics’ throughout time, largely depending on who was in government, and \nwhich issues dominated their political agendas. Tweets thus proved a suitable source to track the \nstrategies of political actors, and the findings point to the relevance of stud ying new means of \npolitical communication (see e.g. Lassen and Brown 2011; Towner and Dulio 2012). Indeed, much \nmore than party manifestos, tweets allow researchers to map short -term developments in party \nstrategies in between elections. The results also s how that political actors branded as ‘populist’ do \nnot necessarily voice criticism just for the sake of protest against the entire political system, but that \nthey can act in a calculating manner, just like other political actors do.  \n \nTWITTER AS A TOOL OF POLITICAL OPPOSITION  \nDue to, inter alia, its low operating costs, interactive, unmediated and personal character, and \n‘virality potential’, Twitter can be viewed as an important new political communication tool (see \nVergeer and Hermans 2013; Jacobs and Sp ierings 2016). Compared with party manifestos, which \nprimarily outline preferred policies and are only published prior to elections, tweets are also more \nsuitable as means to react to current affairs and to criticise other politicians. This applies not lea st to \npoliticians challenging the political establishment, for whom tweets provide the means to engage in \na ‘permanent campaign’ against the political elites, and governing parties in particular (see Vergeer \net al. 2013). Indeed, radical fringe parties hav e been observed to be among the most active users of \nonline technology (Gibson and Ward 2012, p. 65), and also attract many ‘followers’ on social media \nrelative to their mainstream competitors (Economist 2015). The format of tweets – which are limited \nto 1 40-characters – arguably offers more opportunities for politicians with a succinct and \nunambiguous message than for mainstream politicians whose positions are marked by more nua nce \nand opacity. \nParties at the ideological fringes are often associated with ‘populism’, which can broadly be defined \nas an ideology or discourse which makes a Manichean distinction between the corrupt ‘elites’ and \nthe virtuous ‘people’, and supports the idea of popular so vereignty (e.g. Taggart 2000; Mudde 2004; \nLaclau 2007; Albertazzi and McDonnell 2008). It is debated whether populism is an element of \ncertain politicians or parties only, or rather a strategic rhetorical devise or style which can in \nprinciple be applied b y all political actors (to a certain degree) (e.g. Jagers and Walgrave 2007; \nMoffitt and Tormey 2013; Rooduijn et al.  2014; Van Kessel 2014). It may well be argued that for \nsome parties populism is an essential element of their ideology – i.e. those parties which are marked \nby a consistent and frequent use of populist language – while for others populism is not more than a \nsporadic (strategic) devise to put distance between them and the parties they compete with. Be that \nas it may, in the Western European context populism tends to be associated primarily with parties of \nthe radical left and radical right (e.g. Mudde 2007; March 2011). These parties have in common a \ncriticism of the political establishment, but also of other ‘elite’ actors. Depending on the parties’ \nbroader ideological characteristics, these can be the corporate rich, bankers, but also the media or \nintelligentsia, whose (liberal) ideas, values and interests are at odds with those of the ‘silent \nmajority’ (Canovan 1999, p. 3).  \nIn their cross -national study, surveying Facebook fans of populist par ties, Bartlett et al. (2011: 15,  \n30) observed that these parties are ‘adept at using social media to amplify their message, recruit and \norganise’, and that the Internet is ‘deeply ingrained’ in their strategy and identity (see also Mazzoleni \n2015). Paulo Gerbaudo (2015: 68) similarly argued that for protest movements and parties ‘social \nnetwork sites such as Twitter and Facebook have become the means through which to address \nInternet users as the new pr ototypes of the ‘common man’ of populism: the ordinary hard -working \ncitizens, victimised by an unfair political and economic establishment’. Through social media, an \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n597 \n \notherwise diversified mass can be mobilised against economic and political elites. Indeed, the format \nof social media outlets such as Twitter allows politicians with an anti -establishment agenda to voice \nunambiguous criticism and identify the culprits of social problems. In other words, tweets can be \nused as vehicles for these politicians’ ‘inj ustice frames’, through which they identify the victims of a \ngiven injustice (‘the people’) and focus blame or responsibility on established (political) authorities \n(Gamson 1992; Benford and Snow 2000: 615 -6). While in the past politicians and social movem ents \nwere tied to traditional media as a resource though which to construct their injustice frames \n(Gamson 1995), social media such as Twitter  now allow them to voice their discontent without an \nintermediary channel (see Schulz 2014).  \nThat said, not all s tudies have come to the conclusion that Twitter is the ultimate medium for \npopulist parties. From their analysis of Twitter use among Dutch politicians at the time of the 2010 \nparliamentary election, Vergeer and Hermans (2013) conclude that candidates from  less established \nand smaller parties did n ot use Twitter more extensively. They  found that the (populist) PVV and SP \nwere actually among the parties with the lowest ‘adopter rates’ (see also Vergeer et al. 2013). Jacobs \nand Spierings (2016) also studied t he political use of social media in the Netherlands, and similarly \nobserved that the PVV and SP – which they also identified as ‘populist parties’ – lagged behind in \nterms of the number of candidates represented on social media platforms and the \nprofessionalisation of their online activities. What is more, particularly the PVV refrained from \nmaking use of Twitter’s more advanced interactive features, and ‘seemed to consider Twitter merely \nas an alternative to sending out press releases’ (Jacobs and Spierings 2016, p. 181).  \nIt is thus a moot poi nt whether populist parties are truly that Twitter -savvy. However, even if only \nused as top-down ‘press release centres’, populist politicians’ Twitter profiles may well feed into the \npolitical debate, not least because tweets are picked up by the mass media. It is therefore important \nnot only to study the nature of politicians’ use of Twitter, for instance in terms of adopter rates \namong party candidates, but also to focus on the contents of their tweets. For one, bea ring in mind \nthat tweets provide suitable vehicles for succinct and unambiguous criticism of other political actors, \nit is worthwhile to investigate how populist parties (i.e. those parties for which populism is a more or \nless consistent element) utilise T witter in their opposition to the (political) elites. Does their Twitter \nusage reflect well their anti -establishment strategies, and can the medium therefore be considered \nsuitable to study the construction of populist actors’ injustice frames? This articl e has an explorative \ncharacter and focuses on tweets with an explicit adversarial character; those which target actors for \nignoring or causing social problems. We start out from the assumption that populist parties can be \nseen as rational and calculating p layers in the political ‘market place’ (see Scammell 1999). On the \nbasis of this, several expectations can be formulated.  \nFirst of all, populist parties are likely to direct their criticism towards traditionally dominant parties, \nwhich are often in govern ment and can most convincingly be portrayed as members of the political \nelite. As they are typically political outsiders in opposition, populist parties can often freely target \nparties in government (see Walter and Van der Brug 2014). It is wrong to assume , however, that \nthey have no ambition to enter gove rnment themselves; several European populist parties have in \nfact entered, or supported, governing coalitions in the past few decades (De Lange 2012 ; Albetazzi \nand McDonnell 2015 ). In order not to destroy their ‘coalition potential’, populist parties may limit \ntheir criticism of prospective partners, whilst directing their criticism towards parties with whom \nthere is less scope for cooperation.  \nRelated to this, we further expect that populist parties predo minantly criticise parties with \ncontrasting ideological positions. This relates to their presumed caution not to antagonise potential \ncoalition partners with similar programmes, but also their need to construct a consistent ideological \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n598 \n \nnarrative. In view of their nativist and authoritarian character, populist radical right parties are likely \nto criticise those parties that subscribe to ‘progressive’ values and have more favourable attitudes \ntowards immigration and multiculturalism (see Mudde 2007). On the o ther hand, considering their \n‘emphasis on egalitarianism and the espousal of collective economic and social rights’ (March 2011, \np. 118), left -wing populist parties are more likely to criticise parties that are supportive of laissez \nfaire capitalism (in ad dition to economic elites outside of the political sphere, such as bankers, \nmanagers and large companies).i \nIt would also be conceivable to hypothesise  that populist parties primarily express criticism of \nideologically proximate parties, since these are their main electoral competitors (see Walter 2014). \nWe expect, however, that populist parties are more likely to focus on their ideological nemeses, in \norder to construct an anti -establishment message, which is consistent with their wider ideological \nattributes. Indeed, we also expect that the adversarial tweets of populist par ties primarily relate to \nissues, which are at the centre of their programmatic a ppeal, with left -wing populists primarily \nplacing emphasis on the malicious socio -economic policies of their political opponents, and right -\nwing populists blaming their adversaries for their welcoming attitude towards immigrants and \npromotion of cultural d ecay.  All in all, we expect that populist parties, at least when they are in \nopposition, primarily target dominant mainstream parties which often take part in government. In \naddition, we presume that populist parties will be less critical of ideologically  proximate parties with \nwhom they seek to cooperate in office, and that their criticism is mainly focused on the issues that \nare central to their own political programme.      \n \nCASE SELECTION \nWe focus our analysis on two parties in the Netherlands. The cou ntry offers an ideal testing ground, \nas two different types of populist parties have been identified in the contemporary Dutch party \nsystem: the left-wing SP and the radical right PVV (see e.g. Lucardie and Voerman 2012). This allows \nus to assess the adversarial rhetoric of two ideologically distinct populist parties, while controlling \nfor general developments in the domestic political context. The PVV, furthermore, provides us with a \ncase that has acted as a support partner for a minority government (the Rutte I Cabinet, October \n2010 – April 2012). By focusing on the PVV, we are able to explore developments in the adversarial \ntweets of a populist party leader once this party departs from its (natural) role as full -fledged \nopposition party.  Further, the Dut ch technological context is also suitable for our analysis of \npoliticians’ tweets. In addition to the relatively large presence of Dutch political actors on social \nmedia, the country is characterised by a high proportion of social network users in comparis on with \nother European countries (see Jacobs and Spierings 2016, p. 13-4). This implies that Dutch politicians \nhave a real incentive to use Twitter as a means of political communication, as they are able to reach \na relatively large audience.  \nAs far as the  background of the two selected parties is concerned, the SP entered the Dutch \nParliament first in 1994 (having won 1.3 per cent of the vote). The party steadily expanded its \nsupport base until its electoral high point in 2006, when it won 16.6 per cent of  the national vote. In \nthe subsequent parliamentary elections of 2010 and 2012, the SP failed to repeat this achievement – \nit received 9.9 and 9.6 per cent of the vote, respectively – but the party remained a substantial force \nin the fragmented Dutch party system.  \nBy the time of its parliamentary entrance, the SP had moved away from its Maoist roots and could \nbetter be described as a radical left -wing protest party, exemplified by its slogan: ‘vote against, vote \nSP’. The party was also populist in its appe als to the ‘common man’ and its denunciation of the \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n599 \n \npolitical and economic elites (see Lucardie and Voerman 2012). Around the turn of the 21 st century, \nthe SP downplayed its anti -establishment image – in 2002 its slogan had remarkably changed to \n‘Vote for, vote SP’ (see also Lange and Rooduijn 2011). Populist rhetoric could nevertheless still be \nfound in the discourse of the party and its politicians (Lucardie and Voerman 2012, pp. 64 -9), and \nthe financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent economic downturn  seemed to fuel the SP’s \npopulism; the party, for instance, held the ‘political and economic elites’ responsible for the crisis at \nthe time of the 2010 parliamentary election (SP 2010, p. 5). In the recent literature, the SP has thus \nregularly been identif ied as a populist party (e.g. Schumacher and Rooduijn 2013; Akkerman et al. \n2014; Otjes and Louwerse 2015). It is nevertheless evident that over the years populism became a \nmore irregular and sporadic element in the party’s discourse (see Rooduijn 2014; Va n Kessel 2015) – \nmaking the SP a prominent case in the debate about whether populism is a matter of degree or kind. \nThe ‘borderline character’ of the SP has to be borne into mind when analysing the results. In terms \nof concrete policy positions, the SP’s signature issues have always related to socio-economic themes. \nAfter the party dropped its more radical communist policies, the SP continued to denounce the \nsupposed supremacy of the neo-liberal philosophy. The party has advocated higher minimum wages, \nand opposed welfare state reforms, restricting unemployment benefit requirements, and \nprivatisation of health care provision. The SP has also been sceptical of European integration, and \nhas taken issue with the EU’s supposed neo-liberal character in particular. \nThe Freedom Party, in turn, has been the dominant populist radical right party in the Netherlands \nsince its entrance into parliament in 2006, when it won 5.9 per cent of the vote in the national \nelection. The party filled the gap on the populist right le ft vacant after the electoral demise of the \nList Pim Fortuyn (LPF), which fell into organisational disarray soon after the assassination of its \nfounder in May 2002. The PVV was founded and ever -since controlled by Geert Wilders, a former \nMP for the Liberal  party (VVD). Wilders has appealed explicitly to the ‘ordinary people’, and his \ndiscourse has been marked by a strong hostility towards the political elite. In his ‘declaration of \nindependence’, written after his departure from the Liberals, Wilders (2005,  p. 1) for instance spoke \nof a ‘range of interlinked crises flowing from the incompetence of the political elite in Brussels and \n[Dutch political capital] The Hague’. Wilders (2005, p. 2) declared that he intended ‘to return this \ncountry to its citizens’. With this declaration Wilders set the tone for later statements in which \npopulist rhetoric recurred frequently.   \nBesides its populism, the PVV has primarily become known for his anti -immigration policies and \noutspoken criticism of Islam. In terms of socio -economic policies, the PVV’s programme had a neo -\nliberal character from the outset, favouring laissez-faire policies such as tax cuts and deregulation. \nThe party’s policy positions became more eclectic in 2010, and Wilders’ party now called for the \npreservation of various welfare entitlements (see Vossen 2011, p. 186). During the election \ncampaign of 2012, Wilders focused more than ever on the theme of European integration. Wilders \ncondemned unelected ‘Eurocrats’, and opposed financial aid to troubled Eurozone members, as well \nas labour immigration from Eastern Europe. The Freedom Party had always been Eurosceptic, but \nnow went so far as to support a Dutch ‘exit’ from the European Union altogether.  \nAfter its breakthrough in 2006, the PVV won 15.5 per cent of the vote in the parliamentary election \nof June 2010. The PVV subsequently provided parliamentary support for a governing minority \ncoalition made up of the Christian Democrats (CDA) and the Liberals (VVD), in exchange for the \nimplementation of some of it s key policies. This Cabinet (Rutte I) fell in April 2012 when Wilders \nrefused to sign up to newly drafted austerity measures, and withdrew his support. In the early \nelection that followed in September 2012, the PVV suffered a substantial loss. The party r eceived \n10.1 per cent of the vote, yet remained the third largest party in parliament, at par with the SP.  \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n600 \n \n \nDATA AND METHOD \nAs we are interested in the populist politicians’ use of tweets as means to focus blame or \nresponsibility on established (political ) authorities, t he study considers the tweets with an explicit \nadversarial character; those which target actors for ignoring or causing social problems. This is done \nthrough hand -coding Twitter messages (‘tweets’) of the PVV and SP party leaders: Geert Wil ders \n(@geertwilderspvv) and Emile Roemer (@emileroemer).  \nAs national party leaders can be seen as the most prominent representatives of political parties in \nthe Netherlands, their personal tweets are considered good indicators of the general stance of the  \nparty. In case of the hierarchically organised SP and PVV, moreover, rank and file candidates have \nseemingly been discouraged to become Twitter -active in an effort to preserve party discipline and \norganisational unity (Jacobs and Spierings 2016). This app lies in particular to the Freedom Party, \nwhich can be considered as the personal party of Geert Wilders (see De Lange and Art 2011). Except \nfor the European Parliament fraction (@pvveuropa), the PVV does actually not have an official \nTwitter account, and a  link on the party’s website leads directly to the personal Twitter page of \nGeert Wilders. The SP does have its own account (@SPnl), but many tweets refer directly to the \ntweets of party leader Roemer. To secure equivalence across the units of observation,  we chose to \nanalyse the personal tweets of Roemer rather than the SP’s party account messages. \nThe previously stated assumption that Twitter is a more suitable tool than party manifestos to \nexpress adversarial rhetoric is corroborated by the case of the S P. The 76 -pages SP programme of \n2012, for instance, was mainly filled with policy proposals and only included five critical comments \nabout other parties or the incumbent government (SP 2012). The PVV manifestos included \nconsiderably more criticism of other  actors (PVV 2010; 2012). In the 2012 document, we found that \n52 of the 133 paragraphs (39 per cent) contained derogatory remarks, mainly targeted at domestic \npolitical- or EU actors. In this study we therefore also occasionally refer to the contents of PV V \nmanifestos in order to compare these with the Twitter statements. \nWe gathered tweets in the period between the run up to the 2010 parliamentary election and the \naftermath of the parliamentary election of September 2012. This particular period was selecte d, \nbecause it allowed us to track whether Wilders’ rhetoric changed during and after the PVV’s role as \nsupport partner. Four analytically meaningful periods can be distinguished within the period of \nstudy:     \n1. 20 February 2010 – 9 June 2010 : Period in betw een fall of Cabinet Balkenende IV \n(CDA-PvdA) and new parliamentary elections. \n2. 10 June 2010 – 22 April 2012: Period of formation and tenure Cabinet Rutte I (VVD -\nCDA minority coalition, with parliamentary support from the PVV). \n3. 23 April 2012 – 12 September 2 012: Period in between fall of Rutte I and new \nparliamentary elections. \n4. 13 September 2012 – 30 June 2013 : Period of formation and first seven months of \ntenure Cabinet Rutte II (VVD-PvdA). \nEmile Roemer only started using Twitter on 12 January 2011, and his tweets were thus gathered \nsince this date. Tweets were collected primarily from the front pages of both politicians’ Twitter \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n601 \n \naccounts, but to retrieve older (unavailable) tweets, and to ensure the completeness of the data, we \nalso used the search engine http://www.twimemachine.com. Only original tweets from Wilders and \nRoemer were selected (hence: no ‘re -tweets’ in which users share a message from someone else). \nTweets were also excluded if they included personal messages directed to another user (i.e. when  \nthe message started with ‘@’). It can be noted that these decisions were mainly relevant for SP \nleader Roemer, since Wilders’ tweets were mostly original and directed at the public in general. \nThroughout the four periods, we collected 660 tweets from Wilders and 445 from Roemer.   \nAll tweets were double coded by the two authors, based on mutual agreement. We approached the \ndata inductively at first, in order to determine which tweets could be considered to contain criticism. \nIn cases of doubt, we came to an agreement on how to code ambivalent tweets – these decisions \nare reflected in the text and footnotes of this article. ii In the end, we selected all the tweets that \ncontained a negative statement about another actor or a critical remark about proposed or enacted \npolicies. These were coded as ‘adversarial tweets’. Across the four periods under consideration, \nWilders published 272 such tweets (41.2 per cent of his total), and Roemer 164  (36.9 per cent of his \ntotal).  \nThe next step was to assess who was criticised or blamed for bad decisions or certain problems in \nsociety, using the tweets as coding units. The categories we created for this were non -exclusive, as a \nsingle tweet could target multiple actors at once. A first category was created for adversarial \nremarks aimed explicitly at specific domestic politicians, parties and cabinets. This category was \nespecially relevant to test our assumptions about which political actors and parties were likely to be \nthe prime targets of the tweets.  \nSince populist parti es do not only blame domestic political opponents, we also kept track of \npejorative references to certain other actors. A second category was created for the European Union \nand related actors (Commissioners, MEPs etc.). Populists typically view the EU as a n elitist project \nand criticise its complex and opaque decision -making procedures (Canovan 1999). Populist radical \nright parties, in addition, tend to see European integration as a ‘foreign’ threat to the sovereignty of \ntheir nation, while left-wing populists often portray the EU as a neo-liberal project that encourages a \n‘race to the bottom’ in terms of welfare entitlements and working conditions (e.g. Hooghe et al. \n2002). \nThird, we coded pejorative references to ‘economic elites’ (e.g. bankers, managers, companies) and, \nfourth, negative references to the media, as these are often portrayed by populist parties as \nmouthpieces of the establishment. A final ‘other/unspecified’ category was created for critical \nremarks directed at other actors; Dutch political institutions in general (such as ‘parliament’, Tweede \nKamer); unspecified ‘politicians’; or for criticism of policies without an explicit reference to whom \nexactly was to blame.  \nBesides keeping track of the targets of the adversarial tweets, we also consi dered for which reasons \nactors were blamed. Several broad categories were identified after a first inductive assessment of \nthe data. Again, these categories are non -exclusive, as a single critical tweet could relate to more \nthan one of these themes:  \n Social, economic and financial issues (e.g. welfare state, health care, economy, \nbudget) \n Immigration and culture (e.g. immigration, multiculturalism, national identity) \n Law and order (e.g. crime and safety, sentences for criminals) \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n602 \n \n European integration (e.g. threats to national sovereignty, contributions to EU \nbudget) \n Democracy (e.g. elite responsiveness, citizen representation and influence)  \n Counter-criticism (e.g. countering criticism of other actors)  \n Other or idiosyncratic issues    \n \nFINDINGS \nGeneral observations \nWe start with some general observations concerning the Twitter use of Wilders and Roemer. Figure \n1 shows how many times the politicians tweeted in each quarter between January 2010 and July \n2013, excluding tweets addressed to another user  and retw eets. Generally speaking, Wilders has \nused Twitter increasingly over time, irrespective of a few dips in 2010 (Q3) and 2012 (Q4). \nParticularly after the fall of the PVV -supported minority coalition in April 2012, the number of \nWilders’ tweets surged. Roeme r’s Twitter behaviour was somewhat more erratic; there is a \nremarkable dip in the third quarter of 2012, which happens to be the period in which (the campaign \nfor) the parliamentary election of 2012 took place.  \n \nFigure 1. Number of tweets per quarter  \n \n \nFigure 2 shows the percentage of adversarial tweets; those that contained criticism of a certain \nactor, or an explicit pejorative reference to government policy. One notable observation is that \nGeert Wilders did not only use Twitter more frequently after t he fall of the Rutte I minority \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n2010\nQ1\n2010\nQ2\n2010\nQ3\n2010\nQ4\n2011\nQ1\n2011\nQ2\n2011\nQ3\n2011\nQ4\n2012\nQ1\n2012\nQ2\n2012\nQ3\n2012\nQ4\n2013\nQ1\n2013\nQ2\nWilders\nRoemer\nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n603 \n \ngovernment, but also that his tweets became more adversarial. Roemer’s tweets, on the other hand, \ncontained much less criticism in the run up to the September 2012 election than before. Roemer’s \n(relatively few) tweets during the campaign had a rather optimistic character, for instance reporting \nabout the SP leader’s local visits. His adversarial tweets soared after the instalment of the new \ncoalition government in November.  \n \nFigure 2. Percentage of adversarial tweets per quarter \n \n \nIf we divide the time according to the four periods identified, we observe similar results (see Table \n1). In the run up to the election of June 2010 (P1), 42.9 per cent of Wilders’ tweets contained \ncriticism, while in the period of the formation a nd tenure of the Rutte I minority government (P2) \nthe relative number of adversarial tweets was lower (34.5 per cent). After Wilders withdrew his \nsupport from the minority coalition, the percentage of adversarial tweets of the PVV leader soared \n(P3 and 4).  In the last period, nearly half of Wilders’ tweets contained accusatorial statements. The \ntweets of SP leader Roemer were also most critical during the latter period, and least adversarial in \nthe run up to the 2012 election (P3).   \n \nTable 1.

Table 2 shows that most derogatory comments of Wilders were directed towards \nnational-level political actors (politicians, parties, governments or party coalitions). Across the entire \nperiod of investigation, almost two -thirds of Wilders’ adversarial tweets included an explicit \nreference to domestic political actors. It is further apparent that Wilders’ criticism of EU actors \n(‘Brussels’, ‘pocket-lining Eurocrats’, European Commissioners etc.) mounted in the period between \nthe fall of the Rutte I minority cabinet and the new election of September 2012 (P3). This finding is \nconsistent with the observation that European integration became a more impor tant theme for \nWilders in this election campaign. Indeed, also the PVV manifesto of 2012 was filled with criticism of \nEU elites: 29 out of the 133 paragraphs (21.8 per cent) contained pejorative references to EU actors, \ncompared with 12 out of 118 paragraphs (10.2 per cent) in the manifesto of 2010. In the period after \nthe 2012 election (P4) we see a decline in criticism directed at the EU. However, an important caveat \nis that, during this period, Wilders still frequently blamed the Dutch government for its  submissive \nattitude towards ‘Brussels’. The EU issue thus remained a relatively salient theme for Wilders.  \nOther actors were criticised only sporadically. Exa mples are certain media outlets, which received \ncriticism after they had given the PVV bad publi city. In Period 2, Wilders targeted Queen Beatrix \nseveral times in relation to her visit to Islamic countries in the Middle East, and Dutch judges at the \ntime when the PVV leader had to stand trial for inciting hatred against Muslims. iii \n \nTable 2.

The ‘Political actors’ category \nincludes national level politicians, parties, governments or party coalitions. General unspecified references to ‘politicians’, ‘parliament’ or \ngovernment policies were placed in the ‘other/undefined’ category. \n \n \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n605 \n \nTable 3.

Yet, \ncompared with Wilders, the percentages in the ‘other/undefined’ category are much higher (see \nTable 3). An important reason for this is that Roemer had the tendency to criticise government \npolicies – not least austerity measures – without explicitly naming and shaming individual politicians \nor the incumbent cabinet. Since these messages evidently, albeit more implicitly, expressed criticism \nof the government, they were nevertheless coded as adversarial tweets.  \nIt is further clear that Roemer criticised EU actors to a much lesser extent than Wilders. This suggests \nthat the selection of targets depends very much on the (electoral) strategies of populist parties; \nunlike the PVV, the SP did not make European int egration the central theme of its 2012 election \ncampaign. SP leader Roemer did, on the other hand, devote more of his criticism to economic elites, \nsuch as bankers, money -grabbing managers, and high -income groups in general. This is not entirely \nsurprising, as left -wing populist parties are more disposed to criticise the agents and presumed \nbenefactors of capitalism. Despite his more pronounced welfare chauvinist appeal in 2012, Wilders \nremained a proponent of entrepreneurship, tax cuts and deregulation, an d attacked economic elites \nonly very sporadically. \n \nThe Domestic Political Targets \nIn order to assess which specific domestic political actors and parties were targeted, we dissected \nthe ‘political actors’ category. As expected, within this category it is evident that most criticism of \nRoemer and Wilders was directed towards either the i ncumbent government as a whole, or at \n(politicians from) the three traditionally dominant parties: the Christian Democrats (CDA), Liberals \n(VVD) and Labour (PvdA).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n606 \n \nFigure 3. Political actors criticised by Wilders, as percentage of the tweets explici tly directed at \ndomestic political actors \n \nAs can be seen in Figure 3, Geert Wilders’ pejorative references to incumbent cabinets were rather \nscarce in the first three periods. Regarding P1 and P3 – covering the months before the elections of \n2010 and 201 2, respectively – this does not come as a great surprise, as the governments were \n‘demissionary’ and thus refrained from making politically sensitive decisions. More interesting is that \nWilders was seemingly less critical of the PVV -supported Rutte I (VVD-CDA) Cabinet (P2) than of the \nRutte II Cabinet, which was formed by the VVD and the PvdA (P4).  \nMatters are a bit more complex, however, if we consider the political affiliation of the individual \npoliticians criticised. In the run -up to the 2010 election, PvdA leader Job Cohen was Wilders’ \nfavourite target. Cohen was portrayed as a multiculturalist soft touch on integration -related issues \nand problems with criminal Moroccan youths. In the PVV manifesto of 2010, too, the political left \nwas the primary target. The terms ‘left-wing elites’ or ‘clique’ were used repeatedly, and four out of \nthe five times a political actor or party was explicitly criticised, this was (a politican from) the PvdA.  \nIn the subsequent period, however, CDA and VVD members received mor e criticism than the PvdA \nand its representatives. Wilders for instance attacked CDA and VVD politicians after they \ncommented negatively on the PVV. In addition, the PVV leader occasionally criticised the actions of \nImmigration Minister Leers (CDA). Furthe r, PM Rutte (VVD) and Finance Minister De Jager (CDA) \nwere criticised several times in May and June 2011 for the decision to sign up to Eurozone bailout \npackages. Thus, even though Wilders made relatively few negative comments about the Rutte I \ngovernment as a whole, he did occasionally criticise individual cabinet members for taking a ‘soft’ \nstance on the PVV’s signature issues, which were not covered by the support agreement.  \nThis finding is not completely in line with our expectation that the radical ri ght PVV leader would \ncriticise mainly political actors on the ‘left’ with whom there was little coalition potential. What is \nmore, centre -right politicians, not least PM Rutte himself, actually became subject to most of \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\nCabinet CDA PvdA VVD Other\nP1 (N=13)\nP2 (N=55)\nP3 (N=32)\nP4 (N=73)\nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n607 \n \nWilders’ negative judgements from Period 3 onwards. The PVV leader presumably anticipated that a \nrenewed partnership with the VVD was unlikely after he withdrew his support from the Rutte I \nminority coalition.  \nIn the third period we also see that Wilders directed a considerable amount of cr iticism towards the \nso-called ‘Kunduz coalition’, which is placed in the ‘Other’ category in Figure 3. This coalition of \nparties was formed after the break -up of Rutte I, when the CDA and VVD struck a deal on a new \nbudget with three opposition parties, in order to comply with the EU’s 3 per cent budget deficit \nrule.iv The centre-left PvdA remained outside of the Kunduz coalition and the party was also hardly \ntargeted in Wilders’ tweets in the run up to the early 2012 election. In the PVV manifesto of 2012 we \nalso observe critical references to Kunduz in eight paragraphs, and only one to a PvdA politician \n(Cohen). The PVV still spoke derogatively of ‘progressive elites’ or ‘politically -correct politicians’ five \ntimes, but used the adjective ‘left-wing’ only once.        \nOnly after the PvdA entered a coalition government with the Liberals, criticism of Labour politicians \nsoared again. In Period 4, the government was frequently criticised for its austerity measures (e.g. \nconcerning pensions and health care provis ion), proposed tax increases, and for slavishly following \norders from ‘Brussels’ to fund the EU budget and support southern European countries. The VVD \nclearly remained Wilders’ favourite target. v VVD Prime Minister Rutte was criticised personally on a \nregular basis, and on one occasion characterised as a ‘walking ATM’ for poorer EU countries (27 -03-\n2013). In fact, even though negative references to Mark Rutte personally were all coded under the \n‘VVD’ category, Wilders’ criticism of ‘Rutte’ often seemed to denote a denunciation of the \ngovernment as a whole. During this period we only observe a few negative references to the CDA, \nwhich lost heavily in the election of 2012 and ended up in opposition.  \n \nFigure 4. Political actors criticised by Roemer, as percen tage of the tweets explicitly directed at \ndomestic political actors \n \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\nCabinet CDA PvdA VVD Other\nP2 (N=36)\nP3 (N=4)\nP4 (N=39)\nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n608 \n \nAs discussed, SP leader Roemer did not explicitly direct his criticism to specific domestic political \nactors as frequently as Wilders. In the months before the parliamentary election of 2012 (P3) only \nfour such tweets were aired – which is reason to approach the corresponding distributions in Figure \n4 with caution. Compared with Wilders, Roemer criticised the Rutte I Cabinet more frequently (P2). \nIn fact, Roemer also targeted the support partner PVV six times. In the fourth period, Roemer \ndirected more crit icism towards PvdA than VVD actors, and the Rutte II Cabinet was also criticised \nrepeatedly as a whole.  \nIt is further noteworthy that, unlike Wilders, the SP leader devoted several tweets reporting about \nhis cooperation with other parties, including the G reens (GroenLinks) and the PvdA. The conciliatory \ntone of these tweets sits somewhat uneasily with the notion that the SP is a populist party, as the \nPvdA can certainly be considered to be an established party. The fact that Wilders’ references to the \nestablished parties were hardly ever positive suggests that populism is a more consistent and central \nelement of the PVV’s ideology, than it is for the SP (see Lucardie and Voerman 2012). This \nobservation is also in line with the previously mentioned caveat th at the SP seriously moderated its \nanti-establishment discourse since the turn of the century. There is, in any case, little evidence for \nour expectation that left -wing populist parties mainly direct criticism towards right -wing politicians \nand parties. Emile Roemer primarily attacked whichever parties were in office: CDA, VVD (and PVV) \nin Period 2; PvdA and VVD in Period 4.  \n \nWhat were Actors Criticised for? \nWe finally assessed the substance of the adversarial tweets of Wilders and Roemer. Table 4 shows to \nwhich issues the criticism of PVV leader Wilders related in the four different periods. Although issues \nrelated to immigration and culture were initially quite prominent in Wilders’s adversarial tweets, \ntwo different themes stand out overall: socio -economic and financial issues, and European \nintegration. Particularly in the third and fourth period, Wilders’s criticism often related to austerity \nmeasures (e.g. concerning pensions and health care provision), proposed tax increases, and the \nmalign effects of EU membership. Wilders regularly connected the themes of austerity and Eurozone \nbailout packages to deliver welfare chauvinist messages, as is for instance evident in a tweet of 19 \nJuly 2012: ‘Incomprehensible: cabinet grants billions to Southern European c ountries, but our own \npensions are being cut’. Again, the increased attention towards the theme of European integration is \nin line with the programmatic developments of the PVV. \n \nTable 4.

However, the PVV leader did not always relate \nthese issues explicitly to the failu re of political actors, which is a reason why the themes of \nimmigration and culture – and law and order for that matter – were not more prominent in \nWilders’s adversarial tweets. Furthermore, not all tweets could be related to specific substantive \nissues; particularly in the first and second period, for instance, Wilders regularly used tweets in a \npersonal attack against politicians who had criticised the PVV.  \n \nTable 5.

In essence, Roemer’s criticism of the Rutte I and Rutte II cabinets was very similar. The SP \nleader frequently condemned cuts in the education and health care sectors, and criticised austerity \nmeasures that were deemed to hamper economic growth and hit low -income groups. Socio -\neconomic themes were thus more dominant in Roemer’s adversarial tweets than in Wilders’s, \nwhereas the PVV leader focused more than Roemer on themes related to immigration and culture, \nlaw and order, and European integration. It is notable, however, that Wilders only truly began to \ncriticise austerity measures after the breakup of the PVV -supported Rutte I go vernment, whereas \nRoemer criticised the policies of both Rutte I and Rutte II. These results again suggest that Wilders \nhas been selective in targeting opponents, and also that he has criticised different actors for \ndifferent reasons across time.    \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n610 \n \n \nCONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION \nTwitter has become a potentially potent new political communications tool, and several authors \nhave noted the suitability of social media for populist politicians in particular (Bartlett et al. 2011; \nGerbaudo 2015). Tweets – which are limited to 140-characters – are suitable means for populist \npoliticians to express their unambiguous and succinct criticism of (political) elites, and to construct \ntheir ‘injustice frames’ (Gamson 1992). Although it is questionable whether populist parties  always \nmake full use of the more advanced (interactive) features of Twitter (Vergeer and Hermans 2013; \nJacobs and Spierings 2016), the mere use of the medium as a top -down advertisement tool may \nboost the impact populist parties have on the political deba te. In our explorative study we assessed \nhow populist parties used Twitter as a means of political opposition. Did their Twitter usage reflect \nwell the anti -establishment strategies of populist parties, and can the medium therefore be \nconsidered suitable to study the construction of populist injustice frames? \nWe aimed to answer these questions by studying the adversarial tweets of the party leaders of two \n(alleged) populist parties in the Netherlands: Geert Wilders of the radical right PVV and Emile \nRoemer of the left-wing SP. Our results indicated that populists tend to be selective in choosing their \nenemies, and that the targets of their criticism can change over time. This was clear in the Twitter \nbehaviour of the radical right PVV leader Geert Wilders in  particular. From the outset, Wilders’ \ncriticism – in tweets as well as in the 2010 election manifesto – focused more often on cultural \nissues than on the economy, blaming primarily politicians from the ‘left’. Especially after his party \nwithdrew its suppo rt from the centre -right VVD -CDA minority government, Wilders shifted his \ntargets. The PVV leader now condemned the representatives of the EU elite, and also the ‘Kunduz \ncoalition’ and the Rutte II government for giving in to the demands from ‘Brussels’ an d passing ‘a -\nsocial’ austerity measures. Thus, even though Wilders remained a fierce opponent of progressive \nelites, immigration and Islam, the nature of his adversarial tweets changed throughout the years, \nboth in terms of actors targeted and issues at stake.  \nThe Twitter behaviour of SP leader Roemer, on the other hand, was characterised by more \ncontinuity as far as the substance of his criticism was concerned. In both the Rutte I and Rutte II \ngoverning periods, Roemer criticised the enacted or proposed austerity measures and spending cuts, \nand mainly targeted the responsible parties in power. Unlike the PVV, the SP did not make European \nintegration a central theme of its 2012 parliamentary election campaign – even though the part y \nwas clearly Eurosceptic – and this was reflected in SP leader Roemer’s tweets. It was remarkable that \nthe SP leader expressed little criticism through his tweets in the run up to the 2012 election. This \nmay be a reflection of the party’s office -seeking strategy, and aim to portray itself as a responsible \ncoalition partner (see Lucardie and Voerman 2012). The ‘moderate’ course of the SP was also \napparent in the party’s manifesto of 2012, which contained few critical remarks of other political \nactors, certa inly in comparison with the PVV document. Indeed, these findings corroborate the \nobservation that the SP’s populist rhetoric has become more episodic and muted after the turn of \nthe 21st century (see also Rooduijn 2014).  \nIn general, the results show that,  quite unsurprisingly, populist parties mainly target incumbent \nmainstream parties and politicians in their adversarial tweets, even though their criticism may be \nmore muted once they are in power themselves (see Walter 2014; Walter and Van der Brug 2014).  \nOur findings further suggest that populist parties do not always target domestic opponents on the \nbasis of their ideological proximity. Consistent with the socialist character of his party, SP leader \nRoemer criticised economic elites more often than Wilde rs, but also targeted the ideologically \nproximate PvdA when this party was in office. Wilders, in turn, shifted his focus from the PvdA to the \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n611 \n \ncentre right VVD, and Prime Minister Rutte in particular. As a direct electoral competitor, the VVD \nhad ostensibly become a more logical target after relations with the PVV had soured and a renewed \ncooperation appeared unlikely. Thus, concerning the domestic targets of populist parties’ criticism, \nthe two cases in the Netherlands suggest that the incumbency status of  mainstream parties, as well \nas the potential for cooperation, play a larger role than ideological proximity as such.   \nThe analysis has shown that developments in the politicians’ adversarial tweets were in line with the \nwider ideological characteristics and developments of their parties. This suggests that Twitter \nmessages can be a valuable source to assess the ideological course and strategies of political parties. \nAs expected, tweets proved to be particularly useful in assessing whom politicians seek to blame and \ncriticise. Even though PVV programmes did contain many derogatory remarks as well, we have seen \nthat critical comments were much more frequent in Emile Roemer’s tweets than in SP party \nmanifestos. Furthermore, the fact that many politicians use Twitter on a day -to-day basis allows for \nan assessment of the discourse of political actors continuously over time and outside of election \nperiods. Indeed, Twitter is a particularly useful source for the observation of short -term strategic \nshifts.  \nFor pop ulist parties in particular, tweets provide a good insight into their anti -establishment \nstrategies and the targets of their criticism. Although further research focusing on other cases \n(beyond the Netherlands) is required to verify this, our analysis also  suggests that ‘genuine’ populist \nparties are more likely to use Twitter as a means to construct injustice frames than parties with a \nless outspoken populist character. It is evident that the leader of the PVV used Twitter as a tool of \npolitical opposition  quite consistently throughout time, while the leader of the SP, a party which \ntoned down its populism substantially over the years, was found to air more ‘positive’ tweets. In \nterms of content, furthermore, Wilders’ adversarial tweets had a personal chara cter more often \nthan Roemers’, explicitly naming and shaming the political actors held responsible for societal \nproblems or bad decisions. The differences between the two cases thus suggest that genuine \npopulist actors use Twitter more consistently as a tool of opposition than politicians and parties who \ndo not, or only sporadically, voice populist rhetoric. Again, comparative analyses focusing on more \ncases are required to explore this suggestion further. Relatedly, while it was not our aim to measure \npopulism as such, Twitter also seems to provide a good source for measuring degrees of populism, \nor, if the concept is used as a means of dichotomous classification, to determine whether or not a \nparty can be classified as a genuine populist party (see e.g. Rooduijn et al. 2014).  \nThat said, not all politicians use Twitter for the same purpose or with a similar frequency (see \nGolbeck et al. 2010; Lassen and Brown 2011). Roemer, unlike Wilders, tweeted remarkably little in \nthe run-up to the 2012 election, and di d not appear to use the medium as an important tool in his \ncampaign. This implies that Twitter can be seen as an addition to, rather than a replacement of, \nother sources to study party discourse and campaigning strategies. Indeed, while the medium can be \nseen as a potent new campaigning tool  (see Towner and Dulio 2012), Twitter  is unlikely to replace \nofficial party documents or traditional media as means of political communication. At the same time, \nthe differences in Twitter usage, and developments in this  over time, as such provide room for \nfurther research. Future studies may also focus on the actual impact of twitter messages on people’s \nattitudes or voting behaviour (see Gibson and McAllister 2011; Spierings and Jacobs 2014).  \nFinally, our findings related to the tweets of Geert Wilders in particular tell us something about the \ngeneral behaviour of populist parties. Assuming that developments in the adversarial tweets of \nWilders were driven by strategic considerations, it is evi dent that the PVV leader responded to \nchanging political opportunities, similar to any other vote - and office seeking politicians. The case \nthus suggests that populist parties behave like normal players in the electoral marketplace, and do \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n612 \n \nnot voice critic ism just for the sake of protest against the entire established political system. This \nalso means that we have to qualify the notion that populists portray the two groups central to their \ndiscourse (‘the people’ and ‘the elite’) as homogeneous entities (se e e.g. Mudde 2004). While in \npopulist discourse ‘the elite’ often constitutes ‘a broad and indeterminate amalgam of political, \neconomic and cultural actors’ (Mudde 2007, p. 65), it is not the case that the criticism of populist \nparties is unfocused or unre lated to political developments. Populist parties blame specific political \nactors and parties for their supposed failures concerning concrete policies. There is thus reason to \nbe cautious about treating populist parties as extraordinary, or inherently dang erous, players in the \ndomain of party competition, and to take seriously their claims and demands. vi \n \n \n \n*** \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  \nStijn van Kessel’s research was supported by the Alexander von Humboldt -Stiftung through a \nPostdoctoral Fellowship.

No inter-coder reliability tests were run; the coding was a mutual exercise and we \ndid not make use of a team of trained coders. \niii In the fourth period the relatively high percentage in the ‘other/undefined’ category is partly due to Wilders’ references \nto his protest (‘ teken verzet aan ’) campaign against the government. Since several of these tweets did not mention the \ngovernment explicitly, they have been coded under the ‘other/undefined’ category.   \niv These three parties were the social liberals (Democrats 66), the greens (GreenLeft) and the Christian Union. Oddly \nenough, the agreement was soon dubbed the ‘Kunduz Agreement’, since the five parties tha t signed up to it were the \nsame, which previously supported a ‘police mission’ to the Afghan province of Kunduz in 2011. \nv In the fourth period Wilders occasionally blamed the VVD for making too many concessions to the PvdA, for instance \nregarding its position on the mortgage interest relief and illegal immigrants. In these cases, only the VVD was coded as the \nparty being criticised, unless an explicit critical judgement is made about the PvdA as well. \n \n \n \n \nVolume 12, Issue 2 (2016)                 Stijn van Kessel and Remco Castelein                                                 \n \n613 \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAkkerman, A., Mudde, C., and Zaslove , A.
