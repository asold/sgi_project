    "abstract": "In this paper, the results of tests on a 0.76-TW linear transformer driver (LTD) module for Z-pinch research are presented for the first time. Ten LTD cavities, each generating a 1-MA/90-kV pulse on a matched load, were connected in series with a magnetically insulated voltage adder to drive the e-beam diode. Three inner stalks with different radii were tested, and the results indicate that the output parameters of the ten cavities are sensitive to the cathode radii. As an intermediate step, a high-current pulse with 832 kV/912 kA/130 ns was obtained on the e-beam diode. To date, this is the maximum power generated directly by a fast LTD with mega-ampere current output.",
