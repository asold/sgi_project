INTRODUCTION\nSince the Kyoto agreement was ratiﬁed by most of the\nnations, there has been a global common goal for reducing\ngreenhouse gas emissions through adopting more renewable\nenergy sources such as photovoltaic (PV) and wind power\ngeneration [1]–[3]. Due to the intermittent characteristics of\nthese sources such as solar irradiations and wind speed ﬂuctu-\nations and impact of diffused solar irradiations resulting from\npassing clouds, power transformers are expected to exhibit\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Mehdi Bagheri.\nfrequent daily generation and load variations [2], [3]. For\ninstance, the daily PV generation proﬁle on a typical distribu-\ntion feeder in Perth, Western Australia from a range of rooftop\nPV installations at various locations is shown in Fig. 1. The\nﬁgure shows a ramped power generation during the day time\nwith a maximum generation at about mid-day that gradually\nreduces to zero level at sunset. There are however some\ninstantaneous pulsations in the generated power that may\nbe attributed to a passing cloud during the entire generation\nperiod.\nDissolved gas analysis (DGA) of transformer oil has\nbeen widely accepted as an effective technique to monitor\nVOLUME 7, 2019 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Typical daily PV generation at various locations in Western\nAustralian residential sites.\nand diagnose the condition of oil-ﬁlled power transformers\n[4]–[6]. Due to the high thermal and electric stresses that the\noperating transformer insulation system experiences, decom-\nposition of oil and paper takes place and results in chemical\nby-products that dissolve in the insulation oil and decrease its\ndielectric strength [7].\nThese products include gases such as hydrogen (H 2),\nmethane (CH 4), acetylene (C 2H2), ethylene (C 2H4), and\nethane (C 2H6) that are mainly generated due to oil decom-\nposition [8]–[10]. On the other hand, cellulose degradation\nresults in carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and\nsome furanic compounds [4]. The type and level of each gas\ncan be used to detect various incipient faults within the trans-\nformer such as partial discharge, thermal faults and arcing [4].\nPartial discharge as a low energy phenomenon generates\nhydrogen and traceable amounts of methane and ethane [8].\nOnce high energy discharge has been reached, the phe-\nnomenon of arcing emerges in oil, which produces all fault\ngases especially acetylene [8]. Several guidelines including\nIEEE C57.104, IEC 60599 and IEC 61464 conﬁrm that com-\nbustible gases (except CO 2) dissolved in transformer oil are\nmore representative to indicate the condition of power trans-\nformer [11]–[13]. Factors such as metal and deactivators can\nproduce stray gases in transformer oil. However, the tendency\nof fault gases will not be signiﬁcantly affected by such stray\ngassing [14].\nDGA measurement can be conducted off line using\ngas chromatography based on ASTM D3612-02 stan-\ndards [15] or by using variety of online DGA sensors that\nare currently available in the market [16]–[18]. Several DGA\ninterpretation methods such as key gas method, Doernenburg,\nRogers and IEC ratio methods, and Duval triangle method\nare currently used by industry practice [19], [20]. While\nsigniﬁcant research effort has been conducted to improve\nthe accuracy of dissolved gas analysis measurements and\ninterpretation techniques [8], no much attention was given to\ncorrelate the oil sampling time with the transformer loading\nproﬁle. As shown in Fig. 2, instantaneous load ramping leads\nto an instantaneous variation in the transformer operating\ntemperature [21]–[24]. Practical measurements in Fig. 2 indi-\ncate that a 0.4 pu step change in transformer load current\nduring the period 350 min to 550 min results in a tempera-\nture change between 50 ◦to 115◦. This temperature variation\naffect the evolution of the characteristic gases dissolved in the\ntransformer oil and hence may result in a false diagnostic of\nthe transformer condition. This will not be due to the inaccu-\nracies of the DGA results but measurements being blinded by\nmomentary variations of gas generation or degeneration.\nFIGURE 2. Temperature response to step changes in the transformer load\ncurrent, (a) temperature (b) load current (k is a load factor in pu) [21].\nThis paper investigates the impact of variable power gen-\neration and power market demand on oil ﬁlled power trans-\nformer gas evolution. In this context, a controllable thermal\noil tank embedding paper wrapped-copper conductor sam-\nples to emulate an oil-paper transformer insulation system\nis used to conduct the experiments in this paper. The insula-\ntion samples were subjected to temporary linear temperature\nvariation of different slopes to simulate load and generation\nvariations that a real transformer exhibits during its opera-\ntional life. Three different thermal cycles were used to mimic\nthe nature of PV/wind ramping, cloud coverings and power\nmarket ﬂuctuations. In each cycle, three stages are used to\nextract transformer oil samples for DGA measurement. These\nstages are: temperature rising that emulates rising PV/wind\npower or generation increases due to power market demand,\nconstant temperature that emulates stable loading and falling\ntemperature resulting from cloud covering, sudden drop in\nwind speed or drop in power market demand.\n170344 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH. Cuiet al.: Impact of Load Ramping on Power Transformer DGA\nFIGURE 3. (a) Controllable temperature tank and (b) schematic diagram\nof the experimental setup.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nGas chromatography (GC) has been approved by current\nindustry practice to be the most reliable tool to measure\ndissolved gases in transformer oil. In spite of some disadvan-\ntageous such as the complexity of the equipment, the several\nstandards that must be followed in extracting, transporting\nand storing the oil sample, GC is still a preferred reliable\nDGA measurement technique for most of worldwide utili-\nties. The experimental measurements in this paper followed\nthe IEEEC57.104-2008 standards to store and transport the\ntransformer oil samples [11]. According to this standard,\nall oil samples can be stored using calibrated stainless-steel\ncylinders, ﬂexible metal cans, syringes, or glass bottles that\nshould meet the standards of leak criteria. Amber or clear\nglass bottles ﬁtted with glass stoppers or screw caps incor-\nporating a pulp board liner face with tin or aluminum foil,\ncan be also used according to ASTM D923-15 standards\n[25], [26]. Headspace sampler equipped with an injection\nloop and a line to connect GC was used to measure dissolved\ngases in oil samples based on ASTM D3612-02 standards,\nmethod C [15].\nTo emulate the insulation system within a power trans-\nformer, 25 g circular section of Weidmann T4 insulating\npaper pressboard with a thickness of 1 mm and diameter\nof 17 cm is inserted between two identical copper rings\nof 3 mm thickness and 15 cm diameter each. The oil to\npressboard mass ratio is 106:1. The copper-paper set is\nimmersed in 3-liter of transformer insulating mineral oil\n(Kl50X Karamay or FR3) as shown in the schematic dia-\ngram of Fig. 3. Considering gas leakage and security con-\nditions, the 5-liter tank was fully sealed with nitrogen cush-\nion. To remove any residual moisture, the insulating paper\npressboard was ﬁrst placed in a drying oven at a temperature\nof 105 ◦C for 48 hours after which the moisture content in the\npaper was found to be 0.3% based on ASTM D644-09 stan-\ndards [27]. A brand-new oil was ﬁltered to eliminate any\nparticles using transformer oil ﬁltration system following the\nIEC 60296-2012 standards [28]. The ﬁltered oil was then\nﬁlled into a suction ﬂask with a magnetic stirrer of an agitator\nspeed of 400 rpm. In the same time, the oil was heated up\nto 80 ◦under a pressure of 50 Pa for at least 12 hours after\nwhich the moisture in oil was found to be 5 ppm. Moisture in\noil sample was measured using Karl Fischer titration method\nbased on ASTM D1533-12 standards [29]. The paper sample\nwas then immersed in the ﬁltered transformer oil at 48 ◦C\nfor 48 hours under vacuum conditions to fully impregnate the\npaper pressboard.\nThe experimental specimen including the oil, paper and\ncopper rings was then placed in a controllable temperature\ntank as shown in Fig. 3. To emulate load ramping, the tem-\nperature of the specimen was raised from 25 ◦to 60◦at a rate\nof 0.0714◦/s. During this stage, oil samples were pumped out\nfrom the tank at 30 ◦, 40 ◦and 50 ◦for DGA measurements.\nWhen the temperature of the oil reached 60 ◦, it was main-\ntained for 2 hours and oil samples were pumped out from the\ntank three times at 30 min intervals. The thermal controllable\ntank was turned off after these 2 hours to allow ramping down\nof the oil temperature and oil samples were pumped out again\nduring this stage when the oil temperature reached 50 ◦and\n30◦. This heating process is shown schematically in the ﬁrst\ncycle of Fig. 4. To investigate the effect of oil temperature\nand its rate of change on the gas evolution, the temperature\nFIGURE 4. Thermal cycles used to emulate power transformer generation and load ramping.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 170345\nH. Cuiet al.: Impact of Load Ramping on Power Transformer DGA\nFIGURE 5. Oil samples used in the experiment (a) brand-new mineral oil\n(b) aged mineral oil #1 (c) aged mineral oil #2 (d) brand-new FR3 fluid.\nof the same specimen was raised from 25 ◦to 90 ◦at a rate\nof 0.208◦/s. During the temperature rising stage, oil samples\nwere pumped out at oil temperatures of 50 ◦, 60◦and 80◦for\nDGA measurements. When the temperature of the oil reached\n90◦it was maintained at this level for 2 hours and oil samples\nwere pumped out three times every 30 min. Similar to the\nprevious cycle, after 2 hours, the thermal controllable tank\nwas turned off to allow the cooling down of the investigated\noil. During this cooling down stage, oil samples were pumped\nout when the oil temperature reached 80 ◦ and 60 ◦. This\nprocess is shown in the second cycle of Fig. 4.\nThe third heating cycle in Fig. 4 shows oil temperature\nrise from 25 ◦to 120 ◦at a rate of 0.225 ◦/s after which the\noil temperature was maintained at 120 ◦for 2 hours, then the\nthermal controllable tank was turned off. Similar to the above\ntwo cycles DGA was performed on oil samples that were\npumped out at 60 ◦, 90◦and 110◦during thermal ramping up\nand 3 samples at 30 min intervals when the oil temperature\nwas maintained at 120 ◦.\nDuring the cooling down stage, two oil sample were\npumped out at 100 ◦and 80 ◦for DGA measurements. This\nprocess was conducted using a brand-new mineral oil and\nFR3 ﬂuid as well as mineral aged oil as shown in Fig. 5.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nFig. 6 shows the DGA results for the 27 brand-new mineral\noil samples that were pumped out during the three heating\ncycles along with the reference DGA measurements for the\nnew oil. The investigated reference new oil (sample number\n0 in Fig. 6) comprises zero ppm of all dissolved key gases.\nResults show that all characteristic gases are impacted by\nthe momentary thermal change in the entire thermal cycles\nand hence generation and load ramping in real transformer\noperation. For instance, CH 4 concentration is increasing from\nthe reference level (0 ppm) to 10 ppm when the temperature\nincreases from 25 ◦ to 30 ◦ after which it slightly reduces\nand stabilizes at a level of 6 ppm when the temperature is\nmaintained at 60 ◦. The same pattern is repeated in the second\nand third cycle as shown in Fig. 6(a). Also, it can be observed\nthat the concentration of CH 4 does not settle down to the\noriginal reference value after each heating cycle.\nDuring the entire process the CH 4 average increment is\nfound to be 0.052 ppm/ ◦. As shown in Fig. 6(a), CH 4 is\nincreasing from 0 ppm to 3.4 ppm, at the end of ﬁrst cycle,\n7.46 ppm at the end of the second cycle and to 13.98 ppm\nat the end of the third heating cycle. Fig. 6(b) shows that\nC2H4 exhibits a continuous increment with a slight drop at\nthe end of each ramping stage. The concentration of C 2H4\nhas been increased from 0 ppm at the beginning to more\nFIGURE 6. Changes in dissolved characteristic gases in mineral oil due to the thermal ramping pattern shown in Figure 4.\n170346 VOLUME 7, 2019\nH. Cuiet al.: Impact of Load Ramping on Power Transformer DGA\nFIGURE 7. Changes in dissolved characteristic gases in FR3 due to the thermal ramping pattern of cycle 3 shown in Figure 4.\nthan 7.5 ppm at the end of the three thermal cycles. C 2H6\npattern shown in Fig. 6(c) is almost following the thermal\nthree cycle patterns. This gas exhibits an overall increment\nof 4.81 ppm over the entire ramping process. Fig. 6(d) shows\nthat CO concentration is reducing with the cooling down\nstages in the three cycles. However, it does not settle down\nto the reference value as it records 1.23 ppm at the end of\ncycle one, 3.41 ppm at the end of cycle two and 11.67 ppm at\nthe end of cycle three. The CO 2 pattern in Fig. 6(e) is similar\nto the CO pattern. The signiﬁcant increase in CO 2 may be\nattributed to some atmospheric leak or oil oxidation during\nthe experimental measurements. Fig. 6(f) shows that H 2 is\nﬂuctuating between maximum and minimum levels during\nthe three thermal cycles. Cycle 3 in the thermal pattern shown\nin Fig. 4 is conducted to investigate the effect of thermal\nramping on FR3 ﬂuid. Comparing the results in Fig. 7 by\nthat in Fig. 6 reveals the similar trend of gases changes in\nFR3 ﬂuid and mineral oil. It can be observed that at the end\nof the thermal cycle, each gas will settle at a different level\nthan the beginning of the cycle. Also, the evolution of all\ngases almost follows the thermal pattern of cycle 3 in Fig. 4.\nTable I shows the increment of each gas concentration for the\nthree stages; ramping up, leveled and ramping down during\neach thermal cycle. Numerical results in Table I reveal that,\nany variations in the operating temperature will lead to a\nvariation in the concentration of all characteristic gases. The\ngas evolution depends on the type of gas, range and rate of\ntemperature change. This can be clearly observed in Table II\nthat shows the rate of generation of each gas for each 1 ◦\nchange in the operating temperature based on the following\nequation:\nGas evolution = Cf −Ci\nTmax −Tmin\n(1)\nwhere Cf and Ci are the ﬁnal ppm of each gas at the end and\nbeginning of the entire thermal cycle, respectively; Tmax, Tmin\nTABLE 1. Increment of each gas during the three stages of each thermal cycle.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 170347\nH. Cuiet al.: Impact of Load Ramping on Power Transformer DGA\nTABLE 2. Rate of gas generation after each entire thermal cycle.\nare the maximum and minimum temperature of the entire\nthermal cycle, respectively.\nTable II shows that the maximum gas evolution in mineral\noil due to the emulation of load ramping is observed in carbon\ndioxide during the ﬁrst thermal cycle while hydrogen exhibits\nthe least evolution as can be seen in the third thermal cycle.\nOn the other hand, C 2H6 exhibits the maximum generation\nrate for FR3 ﬂuid while C 2H4 shows the lowest generation\nrate. It is to be noted that C 2H2 did not exhibit any change\nfor all investigated brand-new oil samples (mineral oil and\nFR3 ﬂuid). Results in Table II reveals that each gas concen-\ntration will exhibit a change due to the increase or decrease\nin the operating temperature due to load variation. To vali-\ndate this claim, the investigated specimen with a brand-new\nFR3 sample was subjected to one heating cycle with a small\ntemperature rise from 25 ◦ to 28 ◦. The temperature of the\noil was maintained at 28 ◦ for an hour after which it was\ncooled down to 25◦again. Oil samples for DGA were pumped\nout at 25 ◦ (reference sample that shows almost zero ppm\nfor all gases) during thermal ramping up and 2 additional\nsamples were extracted at 30 min intervals when the oil\ntemperature was maintained at 28 ◦. During the cooling stage,\none more sample was extracted at 25 ◦again to be compared\nwith the reference sample. Results of this case study are\nshown in Fig. 8 which reveals a variation in all characteristic\ngases even with such small operating temperature variations.\nFig. 9 shows a comparison between the patterns of the charac-\nteristic gases generated in brand new mineral oil and two aged\nmineral oil samples during the third thermal cycle of Fig. 4.\nThe DGA has been performed on the two aged oil samples\nsimilar to the brand-new oil described above. Fig. 9(a) shows\nthat a temperature changes from 25 ◦ to 120 ◦ results in an\nincrease in CH 4 by 6.52 ppm for the brand-new oil while\nthe increase in the same gas is 41.18 ppm and 25.51 ppm\nfor the two aged oil samples, respectively. The CH 4 patterns\nfor the three oil samples used in the investigation are almost\nsimilar with a change in the generation rate and the ﬁnal\nconcentration. This observation is applied for all other gases\nincluding C 2H2 that was detected in the aged oil samples.\nAs shown in Fig. 9(g), acetylene was not detected in the\nnew oil. The oil-paper sample should undergo a prolonged\nseverely overheating condition to detect a traceable amount of\nacetylene. It is also to be noted that in the early aging stage of\nthe new oil, dissolved gas generation may not be stable as can\nbe seen in the generation of methane and ethylene in Fig. 9(a)\nand (b), respectively.\nIV. DISCUSSION\nIt is noted that ethane exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in\nFR3 ﬂuid as shown in Fig. 7(c) and 8(c). This is attributed\nto the fact that ethane can be produced from non-fault condi-\nFIGURE 8.

For instance, linolenic acid content in ester oil produces\nethane as a by-product of oxidation [30], [31].\nKaramy mineral oil used in this experiment consists of\ndivergent hydrocarbon molecules that makes the physics of\ngas formation during thermal aging process hard to explain.\nFundamentally, thermal stress can break the C-H and C =C\nbonds of the oil molecule to form active hydrogen atoms\nand hydrocarbon fragments. The dissolved gases are then\nproduced by the combination of these free radicals under\ncontinuing decomposition process [11], [30]. Although the\nchemical structure of FR3 ﬂuid is different from mineral\noil, the fundamental gas formation process in FR3 ﬂuid is\nquite similar to mineral oil. The detailed gas formation mech-\nanism in transformer oil has been presented in the litera-\ntures [32], [33].\nIt is to be noted that gas solubility depends on several\nfactors including the type of gas and the solvent it dis-\nsolves in as well as on the operating temperature and pres-\nsure. Depends on all of these factors, gases solubility may\nincrease or decrease with the temperature change. According\nto Henry’s law, if the temperature goes up, the solubility\nof gases in transformer oil may increase, decrease or not\nbe affected [34]. At constant temperature, the solubility of\nthe gas is proportional to its partial pressure which may\nbe the cause of gas decrement during constant temperature\ncycles as seen in the results above. Solubility of each gas\nduring thermal ramping up or down cycles depends on com-\nbination effects of temperature, pressure and other chem-\nical byproduct in the oil. In addition, in order to mimic\ntransformer real operation, insulating paper was used in all\nexperiments which will add another effect on gas solubility.\nAccording to gas isothermal adsorption [35], under constant\ntemperature condition, the gas partial pressure increases and\nthe adsorption capacity of insulating paper to gases also\nincreases. This means that the distribution ratio of the gas\nin the oil will decrease. In the conducted experiments, it is\nassumed that the effect of insulating paper adsorption con-\ntributes to the decreasing trend of dissolved gases during\nstable and cooling down thermal cycles.\nIn general, the above results conﬁrm the strong correlation\nbetween load ramping and the rate of gas generation within\ntransformer oil. As such, measurement of dissolved gases\nVOLUME 7, 2019 170349\nH. Cuiet al.: Impact of Load Ramping on Power Transformer DGA\nwithin transformer oil, in particular using online sensors that\ncontinuously detect such gases in real time, must be com-\npensated according to this correlation for accurate diagnosis.\nWithout such compensation, a false diagnosis is most likely to\nbe reported as continuous gas evolution due to load ramping\neven with a small amount will be interpreted as a fault. Initial\ninvestigation in this paper proposes that, appropriate oil sam-\npling time is during a stable load after a cooling down thermal\nramping. This implies that oil sampling for DGA must be\ncorrelated to the transformer loading proﬁle. For accurate\nDGA results, oil should be sampled during a stable nominal\ntransformer load. However, further research efforts need to\nbe conducted to quantify this correlation and identify ideal\nDGA oil sampling time for several in-service transformers of\nvarious loading and operating conditions.\nV. CONCLUSION\nAs the transformer load ramping and DGA correlation has\nnot yet been given much attention at the research and industry\npractice levels, this paper presents an initial investigation to\nexplore such correlation. Experimental results indicate that\nload and generation ramping lead to a change in the trans-\nformer operating temperature. Temperature change even in a\nsmall range affects the generation rate of all key gases. The\ngas evolution depends on the gas type and temperature rate of\nchange. Aged oil samples are more sensitive to load ramping\nthan new oil. Results also show that mineral oil and natural\nester (FR3) ﬂuid have almost similar trends when subjected\nto the same thermal cycles.\nTo avoid false transformer online/ofﬂine DGA-based diag-\nnosis, load variation during oil sampling time must be\nrecorded and compensated. According to the initial experi-\nmental results in this paper, it may be more accurate to extract\noil samples for DGA during a stable transformer nominal\nload.\nThe trend of gas evolution during a stable and cooling down\nstages along with a quantiﬁed correlation between each gas\nevolution and load ramping for accurate compensation need\nfurther investigation in the future research work.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
