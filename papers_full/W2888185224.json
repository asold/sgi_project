I NTRODUCTION\nReal-time Analog Processing (RAP) is a microwave-\nterahertz-optical technology that consists in manipulating elec-\ntromagnetic signals in real-time using dispersion-engineered\ncomponents called phasers [1]. This technology has re-\ncently been introduced as a potential high-speed and low-\nlatency alternative to dominantly digital technologies, given\nits unique features of real-time operation, low-power con-\nsumption and low-cost production [1]. RAP phasers have\nbeen realized in different architectures, including C-sections\nand D-sections [2]–[6], coupled resonators [7], [8], nonuni-\nform delay lines [9], [10], metamaterial transmission-line\nstructures [11], loss-gain pairs [12], and RAP has been\ndemonstrated in several applications, including compressive\nreceiving [11], real-time spectrum analysis [13], [14], real-\ntime spectrum snifﬁng [15], [16], Hilbert transformation [17],\nSNR enhanced impulse radio transceiving [18], dispersion\ncode multiple access (DCMA) [19], signal encryption [20],\nradio-frequency identication [21] and scanning-rate control in\nantenna arrays [22].\nEfﬁciently performing mathematical operations is central\nto any type of processing. Whereas mathematical operations\nare completely natural in digital signal processing, they are\nmuch less obvious in RAP, where they are still essential\nto help making this technology more ﬂexible and efﬁcient.\nFortunately, several real-time analog mathematical operations\nXiaoyi Wang, Lianfeng Zou, Zo ´e-Lise Deck-L ´eger and Christophe Caloz\nare with department of electrical engineering, Polytechnique Montr ´eal,\nMontr´eal, Qu ´ebec, H3T 1J4, Canada. xiaoyi.wang@polymtl.ca\nJos´e Aza ˜na is with Institut National de la Recherche Scientiﬁque – ´Energie\nMat´eriaux et T ´el´ecommunications (INRS-EMT), Varennes, Qu´ebec, J3X 1S2,\nCanada.\nhave already been successfully demonstrated, including dif-\nferentiation [23], integration [24], expansion and compres-\nsion [11], time reversal [25], Fourier transformation [9] and\nHilbert transformation [26].\nThe Hilbert transformation is a particularly fundamental\noperation in both physics and engineering. It has already\nbeen implemented in a few RAP applications, such as single\nside-band (SSB) modulation [24], [27], band-pass and band-\nstop ﬁltering [26] and edge/peak detection [28]. However, the\nHilbert transformers reported to date have been exclusively\ndesigned in the optical regime using optical ﬁber structures\nthat are not transposable to lower frequencies, and they have\nbeen mostly described in purely mathematical terms with little\ninsight into the device physics. This paper reports a RAP\nmicrowave Hilbert transformer, based on branch-line couplers\nand resonant loops, and explains the physical operation of\nthis transformer, using both time-domain and steady-state\nperspectives.\nII. R ECALL ON THE HILBERT TRANSFORMATION\nThe Hilbert transformation, Hr¨s, is the linear operation\ndepicted in Fig. 1.

In a physical RAP realization, the closest\npossible magnitude response is the band-pass response shown\nin Fig. 2(e) associated with the gradual phase response shown\nin Fig. 2(f) and corresponding to the impulse function plotted\nin Fig. 2(d). If the signal to process is completely included in\nthe pass-band [Fig. 2(e)] of transformer, then the magnitude\nlimitation is practically not problematic. The consequence\nof the phase deviation is more subtle, but also not funda-\nmentally problematic in practice. The (nonzero) asymptotic\nslopes around ω0 correspond to simple nondispersive delays,\nwhich play no processing role other than shifting the entire\nprocessed pulse in time. On the other hand, the progressive\nphase transition is not prohibitive if the signals of interest do\nnot carry energy in that region.\nNote that applying the Hilbert transform twice restores the\ninitial function except for a negative sign.

C OUPLER -RESONATOR BASED HILBERT\nTRANSFORMER ANALYSIS\nHow can one realize a physical component with a transfer\nfunction of the type shown in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f)? Such a\ncomponent should pass all the signal power in the operation\nfrequency band, according to Fig. 2(e), and exhibit a sharp\nphase rotation, and hence a group delay [ τpωq“|B φpωq{Bω|]\npeak, at the center frequency ω0, according to Fig. 2(f).\nThe ﬁrst requirement suggests a waveguide and the second a\nresonant delay element coupled to it. This leads to the structure\nshown in Fig. 3(a), which is composed of a straight waveguide\nconnecting the input ( 1⃝) to the output ( 2⃝) and coupling to\na transmission-line loop resonator ( 3⃝- 4⃝- 3⃝) with coupled\nsection 3⃝- 4⃝.\n1\n1 2\n2\n3\n34\n4\ninput output\nforward coupler\ntransmission line\n(a)\n(b)\nT\nT\nT\nD\nD\nCC\nC\nFig. 3. Typical implementation of a RAP Hilbert transformer. (a) Physical\nschematics. (b) Signal ﬂow chart.\nThe structure of Fig. 3(a) may be modeled by the signal ﬂow\nchart drawn in Fig. 3(b), where T and C, denote the trans-\nmission and coupling coefﬁcients of the coupler, respectively,\nDdenotes the transmission coefﬁcient of the transmission-line\nloop, and where the coupler isolation is assumed to be inﬁnite.\nUsing standard ﬂow-chart rules [30] yields then the transfer\nfunction\nS21 “T ` C2D\n1 ´TD, (6)\nwhere T, C and D are complex quantities.

Moreover, assuming that the transmission-\nline loop (minus the part common with the coupler section)\nis lossless and characterized by the time delay of the τ0, we\nhave\nD“e´jωτ0 . (10)\nSubstituting (9) and (10) into (6) ﬁnally yields the\nfollowing expression for the transfer function of the Hilbert\ntransformer as a function of the complex quantity T1:\nS21pω; Tq“ T ´e´jpω0τ0´2θq\n1 ´Te´jωτ0\n, (11)\nfrom which the system phase and group delay may be com-\nputed as\nφpω; Tq“ =tS21pω; Tqu (12a)\nand\nτpω; Tq“´ Bφpω; Tq\nBω , (12b)\nrespectively.\nIf the coupled part of the loop is λ{2-long, or θ “ π, as\nwill be the case with the ﬁnal (cascaded double) branch-line\ncoupler (Fig. 8), the shortest possible length of the uncoupled\npart of the transmission-line loop is 3λ{2, or τ0 “ 3π{ω0,\ncorresponding to a 2λ resonant loop. Figures 4(a) and 4(b)\nplot the phase and group delay obtained by (12a) and (12b) for\nthis scenario with center frequency f0 “ω0{p2πq“ 10 GHz.\nThese results will be commented in Sec. IV and physically\nexplained in Sec. VI.\nIV. T RANSFORMER CHARACTERIZATION\nAs announced in Fig. 2(f) and veriﬁed in Fig. 4(a), the phase\nresponse of a RAP Hilbert transformer signiﬁcantly departs\nfrom that of the ideal mathematical Hilbert transformer, plotted\nin Fig. 2(c): speciﬁcally, 1) the asymptotic slopes for ω!ω0\nand ω \" ω0 are nonzero, and 2) the transition bandwidth\nbetween the asymptotic slopes is nonzero.\nIn order to quantitatively characterize physical Hilbert trans-\nformers in terms of these two aspects, we deﬁne here related\nquantities, with the help of Fig. 5.\nWe deﬁne the rotated phaseas the phase difference between\nthe tangents to the phase curves at 80% and 120% of ω0 (40%\ncentered bandwidth), namely\n∆φp|C|q“ φp0.8ω0q´ φp1.2ω0q` 0.4ω0\ndφpωq\ndω\nˇˇˇˇ\n0.8ω0\n, (13)\nwhich depends on the coupling level, |C|, according to Fig. 4.\nMoreover, we deﬁne the transition bandwidth, which is also\na function of |C|, as the symmetric band delimited by the\n1Later studies will investigate the response of the Hilbert transformer in\nterms of the coupling, which would suggest to express S21 as a function\nof C rather than T. However, it turns out that the latter expression is much\nmore complicated than the former, while offering no speciﬁc beneﬁt. For\nthis reason, we have decided to give here S21 as a function of T, where\nT “\na\n1 ´|C|2ejp=C`π{2q according to (7) ( |T|“\na\n1 ´|C|2) and (8)\n(=T “=C`π{2).\n7 8 9 10 11 12 13 \n-630 \n-540 \n-450 \n-360 \n-270 \n-180 \n-90 \n7 8 9 10 11 12 13 \n0\n0.5 \n1\n1.5 \n2\n2.5 \n3\n0\n0.1 \n0.2 \n0.3 \n0.4 \n0.5 \n0.6 \n0.7 \n9.4 10.6 9.6 9.8 10 10.2 10.4 \n|C| “ 0\n|C| “ 0\n|C| “ 0.1\n|C| “ 0.1\n|C| “ 0.5\n|C| “ 0.5\n|C| “ 0.9\n|C| “ 0.9\n|C| “ 1\n|C| “ 1\n∆φp|C|q\nfrequency – f (GHz)\nfrequency – f (GHz)\nphase – φ (˝)group delay – τ (ns)\n(a)\n(b)\nFig. 4.

It shows that the rotated phase ( ∆φ)\nis inversely proportional to the coupling level ( |C|) while\nthe transition bandwidth ( ∆ω), being inversely proportional\nto the rotated phase, is proportional to the coupling level.\nThis may be mathematically explained in terms of the group\ndelay, plotted in Fig. 4(b): since the phase is the integral of the\ngroup delay [Eq. (12b)], the transition bandwidth (resp. rotated\nphase) is necessarily proportional (resp. inversely proportional)\nto the group delay bandwidth, and hence inversely proportional\n(resp. proportional) with the coupling level.

M ICROWAVE IMPLEMENTATION\nFigure 6 shows that the 180˝ rotated phase needed for\nthe RAP Hilbert transformer [Fig. 2(f)] would require a\ncoupling coefﬁcient of |C| “ 0.87. Such a high coupling\nlevel is difﬁcult to attain in microwave couplers. Moreover,\nalso according to Fig. 6, it would lead to a relatively large –\nperhaps undesirably large - transition bandwidth.\nTo avoid these two issues, we propose to cascade two\nidentical couplers of lower coupling (and hence also of\nsmaller transition bandwidth) to realize the required total 180˝\nrotated phase. Speciﬁcally, we choose a single-coupler rotated\nphase of 270˝, corresponding to a total rotated phase of\n2ˆ270˝ “540˝ ﬁ 180˝. This, according to Fig. 6 corresponds\nto a coupling coefﬁcient of |C| “0.71, associated with a\ntransition bandwidth that is narrower than that associated with\n|C|“ 0.87.\nThe largest coupling bandwidths at microwaves are pro-\nvided by coupled-line couplers. However, these couplers are\nrestricted to low coupling levels, typically substantially smaller\nthan 3-dB. Therefore, we decide to use here a branch-line\ncoupler [30], whose coupling level of |C|“ 1{\n?\n2 “0.707 «\n0.71 is the most commonly used in practice.\nFigure 7 shows the corresponding layout composition for a\nsingle unit, with the input-output connections, the branch-line\ncoupler itself, the loop resonator and the assembly of the last\ntwo given in Figs. 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d), respectively.\n1 2 1 2\n3 4\n3 4\n1 2\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFig. 7.

The transmission-line sections within the red boxes\nin (b) and (c) are merged together in (d).\nAs explained above, the single-unit assembly in Fig. 7(d)\nwill be designed to provide a 270˝ rotated phase, and two such\nunits will be cascaded to achieve the required 2 ˆ270˝ “\n540˝ ﬁ 180˝ rotated phase. However, the bandwidth of a\nbranch-line coupler is typically in the order of 15% [30]\nwhile the transition bandwidth for the selected coupling level\n(|C|“ 0.71) is of around 20%, according Fig. 6. Therefore,\nwe replace the single-section branch-line coupler by a double-\nsection branch-line coupler [30].

Steady-State Regime\nTable I compares the steady-state harmonic regime oper-\nation of the RAP Hilbert transformer at the four different\ncoupling levels indicated in Fig. 9. Let us consider these four\ncases one by one.\n1) C “ 0: This is a very particular case, where the\nresonant loop brutally becomes invisible (or inﬁnitely far),\nso that the transformer structure degenerates into a simple\nstraight transmission line. As a result, and according to (6),\nS21pC “ 0q “ T, and hence the group delay is τ0 “\npλ{2q{pλf0q“ 1{p2f0q“ 0.05 ns (constant). The bandwidth\nis naturally inﬁnite, assuming an ideal transmission line.\n2) |C| “ 0.1: As soon as C ‰ 0, the system recov-\ners its coupled resonator, and therefore behaves completely\ndifferently. Figure 9 shows that lim|C|Ñ0 τ0 “ 8. Why is\nthis the case? If |C| is nonzero but very small, a small\namount of energy per harmonic cycle ( 1% for |C| “0.1)\ncouples into the resonant loop, but an even smaller amount\nof energy ( 1% of the remainder for |C| “0.1) couples out\nat each turn, so that most of the coupled energy loops in the\nresonator for a very long time, hence yielding a very high\ngroup delay ( 1158τ0 “79.4 ns for |C|“ 0.1). Moreover, the\nTABLE I\nSTEADY -STATE EXPLANATION FOR THE GROUP DELAY RESPONSE OF THE\nRAP H ILBERT TRANSFORMER .\nCase 1: |C|“ 0 Case 2: |C|“ 0.1\nwave\nﬂow\ngroup\ndelay\nτ0 0.05 ns\nτ\nω\n1588τ0\n79.4 nsτ\nω\nCase 3: |C|“ 0.9 Case 4: |C|“ 1\nwave\nﬂow\ngroup\ndelay\n11.6τ0\n0.58 ns\nτ\nω\n5τ0 0.25 ns\nτ\nω\nbandwidth is very narrow because the resonator is seen by the\nstraight transmission line as a lossy load with loss proportional\nto coupling, leading to an effective quality factor inversely\nproportional to the coupling level, i.e. Q91{∆ω91{|C|.\n3) |C|“ 0.9: At large coupling levels, most of the energy\n(81% for |C|“ 0.9) of each harmonic cycle is coupled into\nthe resonant loop, but a lot of energy is still coupled out of\nit (66% after the ﬁrst turn for |C|“ 0.9), so that most of the\nenergy is mostly evacuated after a small number of turns in the\nloop, yielding a much smaller group delay ( 11.6τ0 “0.58 ns\nfor |C| “0.9). At the same time, the quality factor of the\nsystem, Q91{|C|, is now much smaller, and therefore the\ngroup delay bandwidth is strongly increased.\n4) |C|“ 1: In contrast to C “0 with |C|Ñ 0, the case\n|C|“ 1 is in continuity with |C|Ñ 1.

Transient Regime\nThe steady-state harmonic regime is most informative, as\nit corresponds to the operation regime of the RAP Hilbert\ntransformer. However, it is somewhat difﬁcult to apprehend\nthe notion of group delay for a continuous wave, since such\na wave has neither beginning nor end. Therefore, we offer\n6\nhere an alternative perspective, the transient harmonic regime\nperpspective, where a continuous wave of frequency ω0 is\ninjected into the system at time t“0.\nFigure 10 shows the full-wave simulated evolution of this\nwave into a simpliﬁed (single section with mono-section\nbranch-line couplers) version – for easier visualization – of\nthe microwave Hilbert transformer in Fig. 8 for two different\ncoupling levels. In both cases, one sees that the energy ﬁrst\ngradually penetrates into the structure, loads the resonant loop,\nand ﬁnally reaches the steady-state regime. However, it is\nobserved – particularly by inspecting the output branch of the\nstructure — that the steady-state regime is reached later in\nthe low-coupling transformer and earlier in the high-coupling\ntransformer. Moreover, the time taken by the harmonic wave\nto reach the steady state is found to be close to the simulated\ngroup delay, taken here as the maximal delay ( τ0). This time\ncorresponds indeed to the transmission time of a harmonic-\nwave “packet” within the observation time, and is hence an\nan excellent proxy for the group delay.\nt “ 0.025 ns\nt “ 0.2 ns\nt “ 0.82 ns\nt “ 1.36 ns\n(a) (b)\n|C| “ 0.7|C| “ 0.3\nsteady state reached now\nsteady state reached now\nFig. 10.

The simulated and\nmeasured results are in fair agreement with each other. The\npassband extends from 7.8 GHz to 12.2 GHz, except for a\nnotch at the center frequency, 10 GHz. This notch is due to\nthe losses of the material and microstrip line radiation, which\nare naturally maximal at the frequency, where energy is stored\nin the structure for the longest time (group delay peak), i.e.\nthe resonance frequency. However, if no energy is injected in\nits frequency range, this notch does not pose any practical\nproblem.\n6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \n-50\n-40\n-30\n-20\n-10\n0\n6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \n-2000\n-1500\n-1000\n-500\n0\n500\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nsimulated S21\nmeasured S21\nsimulated S11\nmeasured S11\nsimulated\nmeasured\naround 540˝\np360˝ ` 180˝q\ntransitionarea\nfrequency (GHz)\nfrequency (GHz)\nS-Parameters (dB)phase(S21)\nFig. 11.

A PPLICATIONS\nIn order to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed mi-\ncrowave RAP Hilbert transformer, we present here three\napplications of it. In each case, the results have been obtained\nby applying the scattering matrix of the experimental prototype\nof Fig. 11 to the test signals.\nA. Edge Detection\nThe Hilbert-transformer is essentially an edge detector, and\ncan thus be used for instance to increase contrast in image\n7\nprocessing or enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in differential-\nmodulation communication schemes.\nThe detection operation can be mathematically demon-\nstrated by convolving the input rectangular pulse\nxptq“ Πptq“\n#\n1, if |t|ď 1,\n0, if |t|ą 1 (15)\nwith the impulse function hptqin (1), according to the deﬁni-\ntion (2), which yields\nyptq“ 1\nπP.V.\nż`8\n´8\nΠpτq 1\nt´τdτ “ 1\nπP.V.\nż1\n´1\n1\nt´τdτ\n“1\nπP.V.\nżt´1\nt`1\n1\nudp´uq psubstitution u“t´τq\n“´ 1\nπln |u|\nˇˇˇˇ\nt´1\nt`1\n“ 1\nπln\nˇˇˇˇ\nt`1\nt´1\nˇˇˇˇ “HrΠptqs.\n(16)\nFigure (16) plots both (15) and (16), and clearly shows the\nannounced edge detection effect, associated with the poles\nof (16) at t“˘1.\n1 3-3 \n-2 \n-1 \n0\n1\n2\n3\n-1 -3 \ntime-t\nmagnitude\nxptq “ Πptq\nyptq “ HrΠptqs\nFig. 12. Hilbert transform of a square pulse [Eqs. (15) and (16)].\nFigure 13 offers an intuitive explanation for the edge de-\ntection just mathematically demonstrated. The pulse function\nxptq“ Πptqmay be constructed as a continuous superposition\nof Dirac functions across the duration of the pulse, as sug-\ngested in Fig. 13(a), since Πptq“ Πptq˚δptq“\nş1\n´1 δpt´t1qdt1.\nBut one knows from (2) that yptq “ hptq [Eq. (1)] for\nxptq “ δptq. Therefore, by superposition (linearity), the\nresponse yptqis the (continuous) sum of the functions hpt´t1q\nwith t1 Pr´1,1s. Since hpt´t1qis odd, the signal within the\nrange vanishes due to mutually canceling opposite branches of\nh, and only the edge branches remain, as shown in Fig. 13(b),\nconsistently with Fig. 12.\nFigure 14(b) shows the response of the RAP Hilbert trans-\nformer in Fig. 11 to the modulated periodic rectangular pulse\ntrain in Fig. 14(a). Since, in contrast to the case of Fig. 13,\nthe pulse is modulated, the detected edges have no speciﬁc\npolarity, but the experiment perfectly shows the edge detection\noperation of the Hilbert transformer.\n00\n(a) (b)\nxptq Hrxptqs\nt t\nFig. 13.

Peak Clipping\nThe Hilbert-transformer is also a peak clipper, and can\nthus be used as a peak-to-average ratio reducer in radar and\nswitched power ampliﬁers, where the peak information can\nbe recovered by a second Hilbert transformation, according\nto (5). The clipping effect naturally exists in Fig. 12, where\nthe center of the rectangular pulse is mapped onto zero, but\nthe effect is not very signiﬁcant there due to the ﬂatness of\nthe pulse.\nTo better appreciate it, let us consider the triangular input\n8\nsignal\nxptq“ triptq“\n$\n’&\n’%\nt`1, if ´1 ďtă0,\n´t`1, if 0 ďtď1,\n0, otherwise.\n(17)\nComputing the mathematical Hilbert transform of this function\nyields\nyptq“ 1\nπP.V.\nż`8\n´8\ntripτq 1\nt´τdτ\n“1\nπ\nˆ\nP.V.\nż0\n´1\nτ `1\nt´τdτ `P.V.\nż1\n0\n´τ `1\nt´τ dτ\n˙\n“1\nπ\nˆ\nP.V.\nż0\n´1\nt`1\nt´τdτ ´\nż0\n´1\n1dτ `P.V.\nż1\n0\n1 ´t\nt´τdτ `\nż1\n0\n1dτ\n˙\n“1\nπ\nˆ\nP.V.\nżt\nt`1\nt`1\nu dp´uq` P.V.\nżt´1\nt\n1 ´t\nu dp´uq\n˙\n“´ 1\nπ\nˆ\npt`1qln\nˇˇˇˇ\nt\nt`1\nˇˇˇˇ`p1 ´tqln\nˇˇˇˇ\nt´1\nt\nˇˇˇˇ\n˙\n“´ 1\nπ\nˆ\nln\nˇˇˇˇ\nt´1\nt`1\nˇˇˇˇ` t\n1 ln\nˇˇˇˇ\nt2\nt2 ´1\nˇˇˇˇ\n˙\n“HrΠptqs,\n(18)\nwhich maps xp0q into yp0q, and thus indeed suppresses the\npeak value, as shown in Fig. 15\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1 3-1 -3 \ntime\nmagnitude\ntriptq\nHrtriptqs\nFig. 15.

Again, the response exhibits no spe-\nciﬁc polarity due to its modulated nature, but the experiment\nperfectly shows the peak suppression operation of the Hilbert\ntransformer.\nC. Single-Sideband (SSB) Modulation\nThe Hilbert transformer may be combined with a delay line\nto provide a single side-band (SSB) modulator, as shown in\nFig. 18.

It reverses the\nsign of one of the two sidebands and combines the result with\na delayed copy of the input signal, as shown in the ﬁgure,\nwhich results in the suppression of the undesired sideband.\nThe effect is identical to that of a low-pass (lower SSB) or\nhigh-pass (upper SSB) ﬁlter, but this implementation allows\nmuch easier SSB switching by simply tuning the length of the\ntransmission line using a U-shaped detour loaded by a PIN\ndiode.\nThe response of the Hilbert transformer based SSB modu-\nlator is experimentally demonstrated in Fig. 19.

C ONCLUSION\nA microwave Hilbert transformer, based on the combination\nof a branch-line coupler and a loop resonator, has been intro-\nduced, characterized, physically explained, and applied to edge\ndetection, peak suppression and single side-band modulation.\nThe device represents a new component for Real-time\nAnalog Processing (RAP), and is hence expected to help the\ndevelopment of this technology in the forthcoming years.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C.
