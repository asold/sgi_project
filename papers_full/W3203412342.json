    "abstract": "The widespread use of social networks has brought to the foreground a very important issue, the veracity of the information circulating within them. Many natural language processing methods have been proposed in the past to assess a post’s content with respect to its reliability; however, end-to-end approaches are not comparable in ability to human beings. To overcome this, in this paper, we propose the use of a more modular approach that produces indicators about a post’s subjectivity and the stance provided by the replies it has received to date, letting the user decide whether (s)he trusts or does not trust the provided information. To this end, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art transformer-based language models and compared their performance with previous related work on stance detection and subjectivity analysis. Finally, we discuss the obtained results.",
