In this article\nthe Harmonic Stability of a Smart Transformer-fed microgrid\nis investigated under different control strategies. The considered\nmicrogrid is composed by a Smart Transformer and three\nDistributed Generators, considering the bandwidth of the DGs\nunknown. The robustness is evaluated analysing the eigenvalues\nas a consequence of a variation of the DGs bandwidth. The system\nis modelled as a Multi Input Multi Output System (MIMO); the\neigenvalue based analysis is carried out to assess the stability and\ncompare the robustness of the traditional double-loop PI and a\nstate-feedback (SF) integral controller. The results show that the\nSF controller ensures a higher robustness than the traditional PI\ncontroller with respect to increasing bandwidths of the DGs.\nIndex Terms—Smart Transformer, State Space Control, Ro-\nbustness\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThe evolution of the electric grid with the integration of\ndistributed generators, electric vehicle charging stations and\nenergy storage systems brings new challenges for the grid\nstability. The Smart Transformer (ST), which is a promising\nsolution for the grid of the future, is a power electronic based\ntransformer with control and communication capabilities [1].\nIt has the potential to integrate advanced control in order\nto ensure the stability, the compensation of disturbances and\nthe optimization of the system under extremely challenging\nconditions. Moreover, the ST can provide low voltage DC\nnetwork connectivity for the interface of DC DG and electric\nvehicles charging stations; that can save the costs for the\ninfrastructures reinforcement [2].\nFor the ST converter control, to adopt PI in dq frame or PR\nin αβ frame double loop controller is the standard methodol-\nogy, for its simplicity and effectiveness [6]. Nevertheless, in\nliterature other possibilities like sliding mode, deadbeat, H∞\n[3]–[5] have been studied. In the case that the converter is\nplugged into a system with a huge number of dynamics like the\nelectric grid, the traditional PI/PR double control loop without\nany damping strategy may lead to critically low robustness\nagainst parameter variations, and the interaction of different\ngrid connected converter can bring problems like harmonic\ninstability [7], [8].\nTo address Harmonic Instability, at ﬁrst it is necessary\nto investigate in which conditions it occurs, thus to state a\nstability condition, and afterwards to ﬁnd a robust control\nstrategy which ensures the stability also under grid parameter\nvariations or disturbances. Impedance-based stability analysis\nand eigenvalue-based analysis are the two most common\nstability evaluation methods [7], [8].\nImpedance-based stability analysis does not require a de-\ntailed system model and can assess the stability by using\nthe ratio of the output impedance of the component to the\nequivalent input impedance of the series connected compo-\nnents [9]. However, this method is developed for Single Input\nSingle Output (SISO) modelled system, is conﬁned only to\nan interconnection point and gives only a local information\nabout the stability [7]. Based on impedance-based condition,\nreshaping the converter impedance in order to satisfy the\nstability condition, has been proposed [11].\nThe advantage of the above-mentioned method is that it\nprovides a general way to damp resonances and stabilize the\ngrid without the need of deep information of grid model.\nNevertheless, this method can introduce undesired dynamics,\nbecause of the lack of detailed model information.\nThe eigenvalue-based approach requires the state space\nmodel of the system and investigates the characteristics of\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of state matrix to analyse the\nstability with a MIMO modelling [10]. Unlike the impedance-\nbased approach, it allows a global analysis of the system, and\nalso deeper analysis such as participation factor analysis and\neigenvalue perturbation analysis [7], [10]. Building a global\nstate space model of the system reserves several challenges:\nwhile the model of the ST is available, the model of grid\nis often not completely known in its structure and in its\nparameters.\nIn this article the eigenvalue-based approach is chosen for the\nstability analysis. Starting from the global MIMO model of the\nsystem, a full State Feedback control law (SF) is developed,\nin order to address Harmonic Instability. The structure of the\ngrid is assumed to be known, and the DGs control bandwidth\nunknown. This bandwidth is varied along a wide range in\norder to study its impact on the microgrid stability through\neigenvalue based analysis, both for the PI and for the SF\ncontroller.\nDG1\nAC\nAC\nMV LVST\n20 kV\nDG2 DG3\n0.4 kV\nFig. 1: Microgrid schematic: the ST is the grid forming converter\nand is connected to three DGs, which act as grid feeding converters.\nAt ﬁrst, the traditional PI double loop controller is modelled\nin the state space in order to realize an eigenvalue analysis\nunder different bandwidth values. Afterwards, starting from\nthe state space model computed for the eigenvalue analysis, a\nstate feedback control strategy is designed and implemented,\ncomparing its performance with the PI controller, in term of\nrobustness against parameter variations.\nThe article is structured as follow: Section II describes\nthe microgrid structure and the traditional PI double loop\ncontroller; Section III shows the control systems structures\nand the procedure used for the model deduction, both in the\ncase of the PI controller and State-Feedback Integral controller.\nSection IV provides an analysis of the robustness respect to\nbandwidth variation on the DG both in the case of the PI\ncontroller and State-Feedback Integral controller; eigenvalue\nperturbation analysis and time domain simulation for the PCC\nvoltage are shown to compare the control approaches.

S YSTEM DESCRIPTION AND TRADITIONAL DOUBLE\nLOOP CONTROL\nThe system under consideration is shown in Fig. 1 and\nincludes a ST with three DGs with LCL ﬁlter. The ST is mod-\nelled through an average model, as an ideal voltage source with\na RL series impedance. In the control design, the converter\nmodulations and the digital computations are modelled as a\ndelay of 1.5Ts using 2nd order Pad`e approximation, where Ts\nis the sampling period of the converter: the sampling frequency\nof the ST is 10 kHz, whereas the sampling frequency of the\nDG is 5 kHz.\nThe line impedances ˙Zb are modelled in series with the\ngrid-side inductor of the DGs ﬁlter. For this reason, the value\nof LfDG in Fig. 2 is the sum of the LCL ﬁlter grid-side\ninductance of the DG and the line inductance. Analogously,\nthe ST output impedance includes also the line impedance\n˙Zl.\nThe standard control structure in the dq frame for a grid\nforming converter is shown in Fig. 3, and presents an inner\ncurrent controller and an outer voltage controller [6]. The\ndynamic of the converter is approximated with a delay transfer\nfunction Gd and a RL series impedance. The current of the DG\nis added to the voltage controller output as a feedforward term\nPCC\nST DG\nFig. 2: Average model of a ST-fed grid with one DG connected to\nthe PCC.\nCC Plant\nVC Plant\nFig. 3: Traditional PI-based double loop controller: the inner current\ncontroller plant is composed by the delay and a ﬁrst order transfer\nfunction, controller through a PI. The voltage control is done through\na outer PI loop with the addition of a idg feedforward term.\nto better compensate disturbances from the DG. For the tuning\nof the double loop the used technique is the Symmetrical\nOptimum, in order to maximize the phase margin, maintaining\na good dynamic response [15].\nThe controller proposed in this article is based on a full\nState-Feedback, which exploits the informations available\nfrom the model used for the eigenvalue analysis to design\nthe feedback law as well [12]. It includes a higher number of\nfeedback terms, which contribute to increase the robustness\nunder DGs parameter variations.\nIII. S YSTEM MODELLING\nThe representation of the system with a single DG,\ncontrolled through the traditional PI and State-Feedback\nIntegral controller are shown in Fig. 4a and 4b respectively. It\nis supposed to have current sensors on each inductor branch\nand voltage sensors on each capacitor. Based on Fig. 2,\nwhich for simplicity of representation shows only one DG,\nthere is the availability of the current ist at the output of\nthe ST, the voltage vpcc at the PCC, the current injected by\nthe DG im, the ﬁlter capacitor voltage vfil, and the current\nat the output of the DGs idg. In the case of three DGs, the\nabove mentioned DG variables im1,2,3 vfil1,2,3 idg1,2,3 are\navailable for all the DGs. The voltage vdg is regulated by a\nlocal PI current controller which tracks a current set-point i∗\ndg\nprovided by a Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT); the\ncurrent set-point is considered unknown and modelled as a\ndisturbance. The voltage vst is the voltage provided by the ST,\nand represents the actuation variable u, while the output y in\nGrid Feeding\nConverter\nGrid Forming\nConverter\nPCC\nCurrent\nController\nV oltage\nController\nCurrent\nController\nDG Local Controller\nMPPT\n(a)\nGreed Feeding\nConverter\nGrid Forming\nConverter\nPCC\nReference\nCalculator\nDG Local Controller\nMPPT (b)\nFig. 4: Control implementation scheme in the case of a ST connected with a single DG: (a) PI controller scheme, (b) SF controller scheme\nFig. 4b is the voltage vpcc, that is the variable to be controlled.\nA. Converter modelling\nThe MIMO model of the system is realized with a modular\napproach in the state space and analysed with eigenvalue based\napproach. Both PI and SF controller are tested. The whole\npower system is divided into several fundamental subsystems;\nfor each subsystem the state space model is derived. The\nobtained matrices of the subsystems are combined together\nin the overall system matrix and interconnected through\nproper interconnection matrices. At the beginning, the model\nis done for a single DG plugged to the ST, as shown in Fig. 2.\nThe global system can be deﬁned in state space form as\n{\n˙x= Ax+ Bu+ Fi∗\ndg\ny= Cx+ Du (1)\nThe output y is the variable to be controller,\nnamely vpcc. The state x is deﬁned as the\nconcatenation of the states of each single grid\ncomponent, thus x =\n( xST xDG1 xDG2 xDG3\n)T\nwhere xST =\n( dst ist vpcc\n)T\nand xDGk =( imk vfilk idgk zdgk ddgk\n)T\nfor k = 1 ,2,3;\neach voltage and current variable of the ST and DG state\nvector includes the d and q component, so it is a vector\nof dimension two. zdg represent the integral of the current\nerror, and it is used to model the PI current controller. The\nvariables dst and ddgk represent the states of the delay which\napproximates the power converter dynamics. They have no\nphysical meaning, but they are fundamental to model the\ndelay in the state space. The input u is the voltage vst, the\noutput y is the variable to be controller, namely vpcc, i∗\ndg is\nthe vector\n( i∗\ndg1 · · · i∗\ndgk\n)T\nof the reference currents\nprovided by the k-th MPPT to its DG.\nThe delay dynamics is derived by the canonical realization\nin the state space of the delay transfer function, obtaining\nthe quadruple (Ad,Bd,Cd,Dd). Since the inputs are two,\none for the d component and one for the q component,\ntwo delay systems are necessary. The resulting quadruple\n(ADEL,BDEL,CDEL,DDEL) for a dq input is deﬁned as\n\n\n\nADEL =\n(\nAd 02x2\n02x2 Ad\n)\nBDEL =\n(\nBd 02x1\n02x1 Bd\n)\nCDEL =\n(\nCd 01x2\n01x2 Cd\n)\nDDEL =\n(\nDd 0\n0 Dd\n)\n(2)\nand the delay dynamics in the ST is given by\n{ ˙dst = ADELdst + BDELu\nudst = CDELdst + DDELu (3)\nwhere u is the input and ud is the delayed input; the delay\nmodel for the DGs is analogous.\nThe ST and the DG model are deduced through Kirchhoff\nlaws, and the delay model is then incorporated in the ma-\ntrices. For compactness of notation, the model is expressed\nthrough the following block notation: each term contained\nin the elements of the matrix implicitly multiplies the 2x2\nidentity matrix, thus is a 2x2 matrix. The dq cross coupling\nis expressed through a 2x2 matrix jω deﬁned as\njω =\n( 0 ω\n−ω 0\n)\n(4)\nThe obtained model of the ST, expressed with block notation,\nis\nA′\nST =\n( −RST\nLST\n− jω − 1\nLST\n1\nCPCC\n−jω\n)\n(5)\nB′\nST =\n( 1\nLST\n0\n)\nC′\nST =\n( 0 1 )\n(6)\nWith the same notation, that will be used from now on, the\nmodel of the DG is given by:\nA′\nDG =\n\n\n−jω 1\nLfDG\n0 0\n1\nCDG\n−jω 1\nCDG\n0\n0 − 1\nLbDG\n−(RDG+Kp)\nLbDG\n− jω − Ki\nLbDG\n0 0 −1 0\n\n\n(7)\nF′\nDG =\n\n\n0\n0\nKp\nLDG\n1\n\n (8)\nThe DG model of (7) and (8) includes also the local PI\ncontroller: Kp and Ki are the proportional and integral gains.\nKp determines the bandwidth of the controller, and is the\nparameter that is varied in the simulation to analyse the\nstability under different DGs bandwidth.\nAt these point the delay model can be incorporated in the\nmodel of the ST and the DG. Considering (3), the ST model\nis\n\n\n\nAST =\n(\nADEL 04x4\nB′\nSTCDEL A′\nST\n)\nBST =\n(\nBDEL\nB′\nSTDDEL\n)\nCST =\n(\nC′\nST 02×4\n)\n(9)\nThe model of the DG can be deduced in the same way,\nconsidering also the PI current controller:\n\n\n\nADG =\n(\nA′\nDG ¯FDGCDEL\nBDELGDG ADEL\n)\nFDG =\n( ¯FDGDDEL\nBDEL\n) (10)\nwhere ¯FDG and GDG are deﬁned as\n¯FDG =\n( 0 0 − 1\nLDG\n0 )T\n(11)\nGDG =\n( 0 0 −Kp Ki\n)\n(12)\nThe interconnection between the ST and the DGs is realized\nby two interconnection matrices denominated Mu and Md,\nderived through Kirchhoff laws as well, that are:\nMd =\n\n\n0 0 0 1\nLfDG\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n\n\n(13)\nMu =\n\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n− 1\nCpcc\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n (14)\nThe overall system is realized by concatenating the models\nof the ST and the DGs in the diagonal of the state matrix,\nand using the matrices deﬁned in (13) and (14) outside the\ndiagonal to realize the interconnections. The model is given\nby (1) with:\nA=\n\n\nAST Mu · · · Mu\nMd1 ADG1 · · · 012×2\n...\n... ... ...\nMdk 012×2 · · · ADGk\n\n (15)\nB =\n\n\nBST\n012×2\n...\n012×2\n\n (16)\nF =\n\n\n08×2 · · · 08×2\nFDG1 012×2 012×2\n012×2\n... 012×2\n012×2 012×2 FDGk\n\n (17)\nC =\n( CST 02×12 02×12 02×12\n)\n(18)\nD= 02×2 (19)\nIn this paper a circuit with three DGs is used, so this model\nis considered with k= 3.\nB. PI double loop modelling\nIn order to realize the eigenvalue perturbation analysis, the\nPI double loop controller must be modelled in the state space.\nThat is done starting from Fig. 3 which shows the block\ndiagram of the controller. The implementation of the control\nsystem on the real system is shown in Fig. 4a. The double\nloop can be written as\ni∗\nST =\n(\nKvp\n(\nv∗\nPCC −vPCC\n)\n+ Kvi\n∫ t\n0\n(\nv∗\nPCC −vPCC\n)\ndτ\n)\n+ iDG\n(20)\nu= Kip\n(\ni∗\nST −iST\n)\n+ Kvi\n∫ t\n0\n(\ni∗\nST −iST\n)\ndτ (21)\nImplementing the double loop controller in the state space\nrequires a system augmentation, which includes among the\nstates the integral errors of the voltage and the current,\nnamely\n∫t\n0 (v∗\nPCC − vPCC) dτ and\n∫t\n0 (i∗\nST − iST) dτ. These\nstates will be called zPCC and zST respectively; therefore the\nstate of the ST for the PI double loop control is deﬁned as\nxSTPI =\n( d1 d2 iST zST vPCC zPCC\n)T\n.\nThe model of the ST with the addition of the integrators,\nwithout the delay is\nA′\nSTPI =\n\n\n−Kpi+RST\nLST\n− jω Kii\nLST\n−Kpi Kpv+1\nLST\nKiv Kpi\nLST\n−1 0 −Kpv Kiv\n1\nCPCC\n0 −jω 0\n0 0 −1 0\n\n\n(22)\nB′\nSTPI =\n\n\nKpiKpv\nLST\nKpv\n0\n1\n\n (23)\nBy the delay inclusion the model becomes:\nASTPI =\n( ADEL BDELGST\n¯BSTPI CDEL A′\nSTPI\n)\n(24)\nBSTPI =\n( BDEL\nB′\nSTPI\n)\n(25)\nwhere\n¯BSTPI =\n( 1\nLST\n0 0 0 )T\n(26)\nGST =\n( −Kpi Kii −KpiKpv KpiKiv\n)\n(27)\nAfter deducing the model of the ST, it must be included in\nthe whole system model through the interconnection matrices.\nThe matrices Md and Mu deﬁned in (13) and (14) are not\ndimensionally correct for the new augmented model, and\nmust be augmented as well. The matrix Md is augmented\nwith the inclusion of two columns of zeros on the left for\nbeing consistent with the dimension of the matrix ASTPI ,\nand is deﬁned MdPI . The matrix Mu, in the case of the PI\ndouble loop, includes new terms derived from the grid current\nfeedforward, and is deﬁned as:\nMuPI =\n\n\nBDELKpi 04x2 04x2 04x2 04x2 04x2\nKpi\nLST\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n− 1\nCpcc\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n(28)\nOnce the matrices ASTPI , MdPI and MuPI are deﬁned, the\nwhole system model, with the inclusion of the ST PI double\nloop, can be written with in a form analogous to (19) as\nAPI =\n\n\nASTPI MuPI · · · MuPI\nMdPI1 ADG1 · · · 012×12\n... ... ... ...\nMdPIk\n012×12 · · · ADGk\n\n (29)\nwhich can be used for the eigenvalue perturbation analysis.\nC. State-Feedback Integral controller modelling\nThe state space form of the system, built initially for the\neigenvalue based stability analysis, is particularly suitable for\nthe application of a full State-Feedback controller. In fact, once\nhaving the state space model, the design of a State-Feedback\ncontroller can be done through eigenvalue placement or opti-\nmal control techniques. The schematic of implementation of\nthe controller on the whole scheme is shown in Fig. 4b.\nThe proposed control law has the form:\n\n\n\n˙z= y− yref\nu=\n(\nK K i\n)(\n(ˆx− xss)\nz\n)\n+ uss\n(30)\nwhere three fundamental parts can be identiﬁed.\n1) Steady-state reference calculator: The objective of this\nblock is to compute xss and uss that are the steady-state state\nand input respectively to track the given reference yref. This\nis done by considering xss and uss linear function of the\nreference, so xss = Nxyref and uss = Nuyref.\nThe computation of the matrices Nx and Nu can be done\nby the solution of the linear system.\n( A B\nC D\n)( Nx\nNu\n)\n=\n( 0nx1\n1mx1\n)\n(31)\n2) Integrator: The integrator is composed by the ﬁrst order\nlinear differential equation ˙z= y− yref, that has as solution\nz=\n∫ t\n0\n(y(τ) − yref) dτ (32)\n3) State-Feedback Integral controller:The State-Feedback\nIntegral controller is described by equation (30), composed\nby an integrator for the tracking error and a feedback law\ncomposed from a state feedback, an integral feedback, and\nthe steady-state input term. The gain matrix\n( K K i\n)\nis\ncomputed by solving the eigenvalue placement problem with\nthe system\n(\n˙x\n˙z\n)\n=\n(\nA O\n−C O\n)(\nx\nz\n)\n+\n(\nB\n−D\n)\nu (33)\nIV. R OBUSTNESS EVALUATION\nThe stability analysis is realized simulating the system with\ndifferent DGs controller bandwidths. The eigenvalue analysis\nare shown in Fig. 5 and point out the motion of the eigenvalues\nunder the increase of the DGs bandwidth, for the PI and the\nSF. The simulated DG bandwidth range goes from 581 Hz to\n1040 Hz. The arrow direction indicates increasing bandwidths.\nA time domain simulations to conﬁrm the result of eigenvalue\nanalysis is done in the dq frame, shown in ﬁgure. The d\ncomponent of the PCC reference voltage is initially posed to\n100V; at time 0.3s the voltage d component reference steps\nto 150V and ﬁgure 6 shows the dq time domain simulation\nduring the voltage step, for the PI and the SF respectively.\n(a)\n (b)\nFig. 5: Eigenvalue perturbation analysis for different bandwidths: (a) PI double loop controller, (b) State-Feedback Integral controller.\n(a)\n0.3 0.305 0.31 0.315 0.32\nTime (s)\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\nVpcc (V)\nVoltage at the PCC (d)\nBW=581Hz\nBW=697Hz\nBW=797Hz\nBW=878Hz\nBW=903Hz\nBW=1040Hz\nREFERENCE\n0.3 0.305 0.31 0.315 0.32\nTime (s)\n-20\n-10\n0\n10\n20\nVpcc (V)\nVoltage at PCC (q) (b)\nFig. 6: PCC voltage time domain simulations in the dq frame for different bandwidths: (a) PI double loop controller, (b) State-Feedback\nIntegral controller.\nA. PI controller robustness\nThe eigenvalue perturbation analysis for the PI double loop\ncontroller can be observed in Fig. 5a. On the one hand, in-\ncreasing the bandwidth brings a faster response in the voltage\nat the PCC, which is denoted by the left shift of a group\nof eigenvalues. On the other hand, the increase of bandwidth\nbrings to instability and resonance phenomena, which are\ndenoted by the right shift of the other eigenvalues. The\nmaximum tested stable bandwidth is 878 Hz. Fig. 6a shows\nthe time domain simulation only for the stable bandwidths;\nit can be noticed that for eigenvalues closer to the imaginary\naxis, the oscillations becomes bigger. The bandwidths bigger\nthan the maximum stable bandwidth are not shown in Fig. 6a\nbecause they are not stable.\nB. SF controller robustness\nThe SF controller differs from the PI double loop for\nproviding a full state feedback. Moreover, it includes also\nintegral actions which ensures a performant voltage tracking\nand increases the robustness. The tuning methods available\nfor the State-Feedback Integral controller are several: in these\npaper a LQ tracking controller has been used. The weight\nmatrices have been chosen according to [18] in order to obtain\na rising time comparable to the case of PI double loop. Fig.\n5b shows the eigenvalue map done with the same bandwidth\nvalues simulated in the PI case. It can be noticed that, with\nrespect to the PI, the robustness is much higher, and the system\nis stable with high margin also in the cases in which the PI is\nnot. The poles close to the imaginary axis, that are present both\nin the PI case in Fig. 5a and in the SF case in Fig. 5b are not\ndangerous for the stability. (c) The time domain simulation\nin Fig. 6b conﬁrms the high robustness of the controller which\nachieves a fast tracking with a modest overshoot and no\npersistent oscillations also with high bandwidth values.\n(a)\n (b)\nFig. 8: Experimental results of the controller response to a PCC voltage step from 100V to 150V with a DG bandwidth of 797 Hz: (a) PI\ndouble loop controller, (b) State-Feedback Integral controller.\n(a)\n (b)\nFig. 9: Experimental results of the controller response to a PCC voltage step from 100V to 150V with a DG bandwidth of 886 Hz: (a) PI\ndouble loop controller, (b) State-Feedback Integral controller.\nFig. 7: Photograph and system structure of the Setup.\nV. E XPERIMENTAL RESULT\nIn this section the experimental results of the system with a\nhigh DGs bandwidth are shown. A MicroLabBox-based 15kW\nsetup including a ST and DGs has been built in the laboratory\nto validate the aforementioned analysis, and is shown in Fig.\n7. The switching frequency is 5 kHz for ST and 5 kHz for\nthe DG. In AC side of ST and DG, a LC ﬁlter with 1.6 mH\ninductance and 5 µF capacitance is used.\nThe tests, shown in Fig. 8 and 9, have been done with an\ninitial voltage at the PCC of 100V , which steps to 150V . The\ncurrent injected from the DG is set to 2A. At the PCC it is\nplugged a resistive load of 50Ω.\nThe ﬁrst tested bandwidth for the DG controller is 797\nHz and the experimental results are shown in Fig. 8. The\nobtained result is the same of the one obtained in the computer\nsimulations reported in Fig. 6. The controller is stable in both\ncases, but at the moment of the voltage step it presents a most\nsevere voltage spike and bigger oscillations in the case of PI.\nThe second tested bandwidth is 886 Hz shown in Fig. 9.\nAs in the computer simulation, the PI controller is unstable\nunder this bandwidth, while the SF controller is stable without\nsigniﬁcant oscillations.\nVI. C ONCLUSIONS\nThe simulations analyse the impact of the DGs bandwidth\nvariations on the system stability, comparing the traditional\nPI double loop with the SF controller. It is observed that the\nbandwidth of the DGs is a parameter of crucial importance\nfor the system stability. In the case of the PI controller, by\nincreasing the DGs bandwidth, the interaction of ST and DGs\nintroduces a resonance phenomenon, which drives the system\nthrough harmonic instability. The SF controller, thanks to the\nfeedback terms from the DGs, provides a better decoupling be-\ntween the ST and the DGs dynamics, and reduce signiﬁcantly\nthe inﬂuence of DGs bandwidths on the system stability and\ntransient response.\nIn the case of the PI controller, DGs unknown bandwidth\nvariations result in a signiﬁcant change of the eigenvalue\nconﬁguration in the global system. A bandwidth of 797 Hz\nis tested at ﬁrst. The voltage and the current of the Smart\nTransformer present a spike and a slightly damped high\nfrequency resonance after the reference voltage step. With a\nDG bandwidth of 886 Hz, the Smart Transformer voltage and\ncurrent present an undamped high frequency oscillation that\nturn to harmonic instability at the moment of the voltage step.\nIn the case of the SF controller, unknown DGs parameter\nvariation are reﬂected in the eigenvalue conﬁguration to a min-\nimum extent. The experimental results conﬁrm the theoretical\nones, and demonstrate that both with a bandwidth of 797 Hz\nand 866 Hz, the voltage and current spikes are modest and\nno oscillatory phenomena appear during and after the voltage\nstep.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge funding by the Euro-\npean Research Council under the European Union’s Seventh\nFramework Programme (FP/2007-2013)/ERC Grant Agree-\nment 616344 ”HEART - the Highly Efﬁcient And Reliable\nsmart Transformer”, by German Federal Ministry for Eco-\nnomic Affairs and Energy within the research project ”Add-\nOn” (0350022B) and by Gesellschaft f ¨ur Energie und Kli-\nmaschutz Schleswig-Holstein GmbH (EKSH) doctoral studies\ngrant.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
