    "abstract": "Primary windings of transformers are fed with alternating sinusoidal voltage, but often this voltage contains small DC offset&#13;\\ndue to unsymmetrical voltage levels. To emulate such working conditions in a controlled environment (Epstein frame) the excitation&#13;\\nwaveforms were emulated as a DC voltage superimposed on an AC waveform. This resulted in non symmetrical excitation of&#13;\\nthe core steel. The harmful effects of this type of excitation on magnetising current, power loss and the B-H characteristics of the&#13;\\nsteel are shown.",
