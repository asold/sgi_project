Although \nAI technology has been available for many decades now, \nthe last decade has forced countries to seek reasonable \nand acceptable rapid solutions in areas such as drug dis -\ncovery, the delivery of medical services, and vaccine for -\nmulation development.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has forced federal \ngovernments and multinational companies to explore \nquick and acceptable approaches, which may require \nintegrating AI into the medical system. In Novem -\nber 2016, the USA Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) approved the first AI-based diagnostic software. \nApproval was given to Arterys Inc. (San Francisco, CA, \n†Srijan Chatterjee, Manojit Bhattacharya and Chiranjib Chakraborty \ncontributed equally to this work.\n*Correspondence:\nSang‑Soo Lee\n123sslee@gmail.com\nChiranjib Chakraborty\ndrchiranjib@yahoo.com\n1 Institute for Skeletal Aging & Orthopaedic Surgery, Hallym University‑\nChuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon‑Si 24252, Gangwon‑Do, \nRepublic of Korea\n2 Department of Zoology, Fakir Mohan University, Vyasa Vihar, \nBalasore 756020, Odisha, India\n3 School of Mechanical Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, \nVellore, Tamil Nadu, India\n4 Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Science \nand Biotechnology, Adamas University, Kolkata, West Bengal 700126, \nIndia\nPage 2 of 10Chatterjee et al.

Subsequently, several AI-\nbased medical products were approved [4, 5]. Zhu et al. \nanalyzed the status of USAFDA-approved AI-enabled \nmedical devices and found that the number of AI-based \nmedical products has increased sharply over the past \ndecade; additionally, they analyzed the trends and pat -\nterns of these devices [6, 7].\nPhysicians are adopting AI in the medical sciences, \nparticularly in radiological diagnostics. Recently, Jha \nand Topol argued for the implementation of AI in the \nradiological diagnostics field in developed countries, \nsuch as the USA [8 ]. AI has made significant progress \nin medicine, particularly in cancer diagnosis, using IBM \nWatson’s reliability, as demonstrated by Somashekhar \net al. and Esteva et al., who used AI to identify skin can -\ncer subtypes from clinical images [3 , 9, 10]. In neurol -\nogy, Bouton et al. developed an AI system for restoring \nmovement control in quadriplegia patients [11], and \nFarina et  al. tested an offline human/machine interface \nto control upper-limb prostheses using spinal motor \nneuron discharge timings [12].\nIn cardiology, Dilsizian and Siegel explored the poten -\ntial of AI in diagnosing heart diseases using cardiac \nimaging [13]. Arterys has received FDA clearance for its \nArterys Cardio DL application, which automatically gen -\nerates editable ventricle segmentations from cardiac MRI \nimages; this marks a significant step toward integrat -\ning AI into cardiology [4]. These examples highlight the \ndiverse applications of AI in medicine, which are prom -\nising for enhancing patient care and medical outcomes. \nTherefore, the use of AI is experiencing a boom in medi -\ncal sciences. Currently, AI-enabled ChatGPT is an addi -\ntion to AI.\nChatGPT, an AI-enabled large language model (LLM), \nwas developed using OpenAI (California, USA). It was \nreleased in November 2022 and became quickly popu -\nlarized [14]. ChatGPT uses natural language processing \n(NLP) and DL to process vast amounts of data [15]. This \nchatbot has been applied in medical science, from essay \nwriting and exam writing to diagnostic suggestions [16–\n18]. Researchers are exploring more medical applications \nof ChatGPT, and several articles have been published in \ndifferent areas of medicine [19–23]. From students to \nresearchers, everybody is exploring novel medical appli -\ncations of ChatGPT to demonstrate its capability to per -\nform a new functions.\nOutpatient clinic letters are an important method of \ncommunication for most hospital specialists and general \npractitioners (GPs), and are significantly important in \nthe medical field. These letters are the primary method \nof contact and communication between the hospital staff  \nand GPs, and are often the sole record of consultation \nheld by the outpatient department and hospital. Recently, \nChatGPT was utilized to write clinical letters [24].\nChatGPT has also been applied to orthopedics. He \net  al. highlighted the significant medical applications of \nAI-enabled ChatGPT in orthopedics. They illustrated \nhow ChatGPT/GPT-4 can help spinal surgeons by facili -\ntating communication, streamlining data collection and \nanalysis, assisting in surgical planning, and providing \nreal-time support during endoscopic spinal surgery, thus \nultimately improving patient care and outcomes when \nused appropriately and responsibly [25]. Thus, the appli -\ncations of LLM and ChatGPT are being explored in vari -\nous medical domains, including cardiology, nephrology, \northopedics, and ophthalmology, must be systematically \ndocumented.\nIn this light, this study mapped the different applica -\ntions of LLMs and ChatGPT in orthopedics that have \nrecently been explored. Additionally, various examples of \nLLMs and ChatGPT assisting orthopedic clinicians and \nsurgeons in performing various medical tasks (such as \northopedic education, surgery, and research), and help -\ning patients, clinicians, and researchers were explored \nto provide suggestions and guidelines. Finally, the draw -\nbacks, limitations, and ethical concerns of ChatGPT were \ndiscussed.\nPotential of AI in orthopedics\nThe integration of AI in orthopedics offers the potential \nto improve patient outcomes and alleviate the workload \nof healthcare professionals. An exciting future prospect \ninvolves the creation of a digital twin, which virtually \nrepresents an individual and holds promise for advanc -\ning precision medicine by forecasting diseases, treat -\nment results, and personalized preventive measures, \neven at the genetic level. This innovation has the poten -\ntial to transform the fields of orthopedic surgery and \nmedicine. AI applications in orthopedic surgery have \nthe potential to identify problems with implants, such \nas misalignment and loosening; additionally, they can \npredict variables such as hospital stay, cost, functional \nrecovery, and prognostic scores. However, the current \nstate of AI technology necessitates a collective effort to \ntransform theoretical concepts into practical clinical \nimplementation. Thus, systematic and robust valida -\ntion and reporting frameworks must be established to \nensure the safe and effective adoption of AI in orthope -\ndics [26]. The increasing significance of AI systems in \nthe medical and orthopedic surgery fields is closely tied \nto the rapid growth of computer processing capabilities \nand cloud computing, and the continuous development \nand improvement of specialized software algorithms tai -\nlored for medical tasks. Given its substantial reliance on \nPage 3 of 10\nChatterjee et al. Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics          (2023) 10:128 \n \ntechnologies such as medical imaging, which offer high \nsensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative prognostic \nindicators for managing orthopedic conditions, this field \nis exceptionally suitable for the utilization of machine-\nbased integration for interpreting imaging studies and \nother applications [27].\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and ChatGPT\nSeveral LLM applications are used by AI to generate \nvarious text-based content based on the provided textual \ninstructions. Recurrent neural network (RNN) models \nwere employed in earlier LLMs to comprehend text. RNN \nmodels are a type of artificial neural network that is typi -\ncally employed in speech recognition and NLP . RNNs can \ncomprehend the sequential characteristics of data, utilize \npatterns, and forecast. However, they face difficulties in \nprocessing lengthy text sequences. They struggle to retain \ninformation from the start of a paragraph and need help \nin simultaneously absorbing numerous words. With the \ndevelopment of transformer architectures, which are DL \nmodels, breakthroughs were made in 2017. These trans -\nformers enhance positional encoding and can simulta -\nneously absorb numerous words while enabling parallel \nprocessing. LLMs constructed using these transformer \ntopologies can include trillions of parameters [28–31].\nAn LLM is a sophisticated DL algorithm capable of \nhandling diverse tasks in NLP . These models are trained \non extensive datasets, which account for their consid -\nerable size. Consequently, they can identify, translate, \nforecast, and produce text and other forms of content. \nLLMs predict text based on the input by considering the \ncontext and varied meanings of words. They outperform \ntraditional word-counting methods by offering a more \nauthentic representation of the human language. LLMs \nare trained on vast amounts of text from online sources, \nwhich enables them to capture the nuanced expressions \nof mental states, generate human-like text, integrate \ninformation from diverse sources, engage in natural con -\nversations, and simulate different linguistic styles and \npersonas [32].\nChatGPT 3.5 is a sophisticated chatbot that generates \nconversational text using an LLM. Since its release to the \npublic by OpenAI in November 2022, it has significantly \ninfluenced the field of higher education [33]. ChatGPT is \nbuilt on the transformer model, a deep neural network \nthat uses self-attention to understand the significance of \ndifferent input data parts. It undergoes pretraining with \nextensive text data to learn the context and relation -\nships in sequential data; this enables it to generate natu -\nral language responses. When users input text prompts, \nChatGPT responds based on its understanding and the \npatterns from the training data. It is versatile, produces \ndifferent response formats, from brief answers to detailed \nessays, and engages in conversations [2, 34].\nLLMs such as ChatGPT have numerous applications \nin surgical science. One notable application involves \nutilizing them for writing tasks, which can significantly \nimprove the effectiveness and efficiency of surgeons, \nscientists, and editors. Moreover, LLMs can be used to \nextract data and make clinical decisions, thus offering a \npromising avenue for their potential applications [35, \n36]. This, in turn, demonstrates the trajectory of Chat -\nGPT-type chatbots as a prospective model in orthopedic \nresearch, encompassing domains ranging from education \nto surgical practice.\nEvolution of chatbots\nIn 1950, Alan Turing first coined the term AI and \nexplored its ideas. In this direction, his question was, \n“Can machines think?” [37]. The first chatbot, released \nunder the name ELIZA, was based on NLP and was \ndeveloped by Weizenbaum in 1966 at MIT [38]. It was \nconsidered the first program capable of attempting the \nTuring test, that is, to understand whether machines are \nable to think. Successively, its sensitivity was performed \nby a psychotherapist, who noted that it used simple pat -\ntern matching and a template-based response mecha -\nnism to match the conversational style [39]. Essentially, it \noperated on an applied pattern-matching interface [33]. \nSubsequently in 1972, an improved version of the chat -\nbot ELIZA was released with added features; this version \nwas called PARRY [38, 40]. Later in 1995, based on the \npattern-matching algorithm and artificial intelligence \nmarkup language (AIML) for creating virtual assistance, \na new chatbot, Alicebot, was released [19, 41]. Consecu-\ntively, several chatbots have been developed over time; \nthese include the voice-driven digital assistants Apple \nSiri and IBM Watson in 2010, Amazon Alexa and Micro -\nsoft Cortona in 2014, and Google Assistant in 2016, \nwhich are all able to keep track of a conversation [29]. \nThe newly developed chatbot is ChatGPT in its 3.5 ver -\nsion. Recently, OpenAI released a more improved form, \nGTP-4 (Fig. 1). Other organizations have launched com -\npetitors for ChatGPT and these include: Bard by Google, \nBing Chat by Microsoft, Llama 2 by Meta, and Claude 2 \nby Claude.\nApplications of ChatGPT in orthopedics\nConversational AI is a revolutionary technology \nexpected to advance further, thus offering the potential \nto enhance various aspects of our lives. Utilizing AI for \ntasks such as paperwork in the medical field can signifi -\ncantly improve efficiency [32]. Healthcare and medical \nPage 4 of 10Chatterjee et al. Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics          (2023) 10:128 \nindustries can profit considerably from ChatGPT, a \nsophisticated language model. Essentially, ChatGPT \ncan help doctors in various ways, including research, \ndiagnosis, patient tracking, and providing medical \ninstructions. However, ChatGPT has ethical drawbacks \nand restrictions such as biases, credibility, plagiarism, \nand copyright breaches. Thus, before using ChatGPT, \nthese potential problems must be properly assessed and \naddressed. Future research should focus on determining \nhow to reduce these drawbacks while keeping utilizing \nChatGPT’s benefits in the healthcare and medical sec -\ntors [42]. AI technology has made significant advance -\nments in the field of surgery and has already been used \nin some surgical operations. The adoption of ChatGPT \nhas resulted in several surgical breakthroughs. Addi -\ntionally, the accuracy of diagnoses can be improved by \nleveraging the ability of ChatGPT to analyze vast medi -\ncal databases and assist in identifying rare conditions \nor recommending relevant tests. Furthermore, Chat -\nGPT can be utilized to render surgical planning more \nefficient and safer by creating personalized preopera -\ntive plans. Postoperative care and rehabilitation can be \nstrengthened by providing tailored recovery guidance \nand monitoring for patients through continuous com -\nmunication and other improvements [11]. Recently, \nAI has been increasingly used to address problems in \northopedics, with various doctors and researchers uti -\nlizing this technology [43]. AI-enabled ChatGPT has \nbeen adopted to perform several functions in orthope -\ndics, such as helping in education, suggesting medical \ncare, and individual case analysis in surgery (Table  1). \nChatGPT has several applications, such as orthopedic \neducation, surgery, and research (Fig.  2), and these are \ndiscussed as follows.\nImplication of ChatGPT in orthopedic education\nA range of viewpoints has been expressed in response \nto ChatGPT in the academic and scientific community, \nessentially reflecting the ongoing discussion on the ben -\nefits and limitations of cutting-edge AI technologies \n[52–55].\nWriting assignment\nChatGPT and other LLMs are useful for conversational \nand writing assignments as they increase output accuracy \nand productivity [56]. Hernigou and Scarlat suggested \nthat ChatGPT could be a valuable asset in orthopedics. \nThey explored various roles for ChatGPT, such as acting \nas author, reviewer, publisher, and editor, and its potential \nto address numerous questions related to the technology \n[49]. LLMs are used in ChatGPT, a general-domain AI \nmodel that has attracted considerable interest.\nPerformance in orthopedic examinations\nLum investigated how well the ChatGPT LLM responds \nto questions on orthopedic in-training examinations [36]. \nReportedly, of the 400 OITE  (Orthopaedic In-Training \nExamination) questions selected, 48% (193  questions) \nwere excluded because they contained non-text data, \nsuch as images or figures, which could not be processed \nby the text-based LLM chatbot. To avoid memory reten -\ntion bias, each of the 212 text-based questions was \nadministered during separate chat sessions. The authors \ncompared the performance of ChatGPT to that of vari -\nous degrees of orthopedic surgery residents and found \nthat ChatGPT could accurately respond to 47% of the \nquestions; however, as the complexity of the ques -\ntions increased, so did its performance. According to \ntheir results, ChatGPT can succeed in written boar for \nFig. 1 Timelines shows the different chatbots evolution\nPage 5 of 10\nChatterjee et al. Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics          (2023) 10:128 \n \northopedic surgery. Essentially, its performance and \nknowledge were on par with those of an orthopedic sur -\ngery resident in their first year. Thus, they suggest that \nAI such as ChatGPT may serve as an additional tool \nfor orthopedic learning and education, particularly in \nknowledge- and interpretation-based inquiries [57]. In \naddition, Cuthbert and Simpson noted that ChatGPT \ncannot use sophisticated judgment and complex reason -\ning required to perform critical evaluations. ChatGPT \nhad a score of 35.8%, which is 30% lower than that of the \nTrauma & Orthopedic Examination (FRCS) pass rate. \nMoreover, this score is 8.2% lower than the optimal score \nTable 1 Application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and ChatGPT in orthopedics\nSl.

Consequently, standards of patient care and \neducation have improved. Thus, to enhance healthcare \nprofessionals’ learning opportunities, ChatGPT should \nbe used in other fields, such as medicine and healthcare \neducation [58].\nImplications of ChatGPT in orthopedic surgery\nGuidelines in orthopedic surgery\nChatGPT and other language models have several poten -\ntial applications in orthopedic surgery. These applications \ncover a plethora of functions, such as producing and \nimproving textual content, extracting useful informa -\ntion from data, and supporting clinical decision-making. \nThese models can help surgeons in several areas of their \nprofessions, including composing assignments, locat -\ning pertinent information, and handling patient-related \nissues [35]. An LLM can create notes far more quickly \ncompared with manual note-making, while closely \nadhering to guidelines; these notes are well received by \nboth surgeons and patients. These operative notes are \neven better with the addition of hyperrealistic graphics \ncreated by AI, which is possible in ChatGPT Plus with the \nDALL.E 3 feature. Although AI cannot entirely replace \nhuman input, these findings demonstrate the potential \nof AI in the medical field and present opportunities for \nfuture development [59]. Some applications of ChatGPT \nin orthopedic surgery are discussed below.\nDisease diagnosis in assisting surgeons\nThe detection and prediction of osteoarthritis and \nimaging of bone and cartilage are among the areas of \nspine disease that have been the subjected of significant \nresearch, according to Cabitza et al. [42]. Medical imag -\ning data has become the primary source of input data in \nnumerous studies [43]. He et al. examined the potential \nadvantages of utilizing ChatGPT in various aspects of \nspinal surgery, particularly in assisting surgeons in the \naftercare of patients undergoing endoscopic spinal sur -\ngery for lumbar disc herniation. This AI-powered chatbot \ncan enhance communication between surgeons, patients, \nand their families; simplify the gathering and evaluation \nof patient data; and assist in the preoperative prepara -\ntion phase (Fig.  3). By providing immediate surgical \nFig. 3 LLMs and ChatGPT in orthopedics. Applications in medicine, especially orthopedics, and its concern and future perspective in clinical \nand surgical orthopedics\nPage 7 of 10\nChatterjee et al. Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics          (2023) 10:128 \n \nnavigation details, monitoring of physiological markers, \nand guidance for postoperative recovery, ChatGPT has \nthe potential to enhance intraoperative assistance.\nThis study explored the multifaceted utility of Chat -\nGPT/GPT-4 for spinal surgeons, including in pre -\noperative patient communication, surgical planning, \nintraoperative assistance, rehabilitation guidance, and \ndata management. Additionally, the potential benefits \nof using ChatGPT in these areas were illustrated, with \nemphasis on its role in enhancing patient care and surgi -\ncal outcomes. However, this underscores the importance \nof maintaining data security and responsible use [25]. \nWithout the need for sophisticated programming knowl -\nedge, doctors with basic programming skills can also use \nChatGPT to create tailored DL models for medical imag -\ning applications, such as spotting bone metastases in \nbone scintigraphy.\nSon et  al. used ChatGPT to build a DL model, thus \ndemonstrating the possibility of leveraging AI chat -\nbots such as ChatGPT to develop DL models for medi -\ncal images [60]. These findings were promising, as their \nmodel demonstrated the potential for correctly detect -\ning bone metastases in the bone scans of 4,626 cancer \npatients. Statistical analysis revealed that the model \narea under the curve (AUC) was 0.8156, which focused \non enhancing data exclusively for positive cases [31]. \nAdditionally, although slightly less impressive than the \nresults of earlier trials, the diagnostic performance of the \nmodel, with 56.0% sensitivity and 88.7% specificity, was \nnotable [60].\nExamining certain instances in more detail revealed the \ndominance of AI over traditional medical intervention. \nFor example, Zhao et  al. utilized a deep neural network \nto create an AI model using a dataset of 12,222 instances \nof 99mTc-MDP bone scintigraphy [7]. The ability of the \nmodel to diagnose bone metastasis was evaluated and \nfound to be similar to that of individual human physi -\ncians. Moreover, when an AI model was used to assist \ninterpretation, it enhanced the diagnostic sensitivity and \naccuracy of human physicians. The diagnostic efficiency \nwas represented by the receiver operating characteristic \n(ROC) curve, which showed values of 0.988 for breast \ncancer, 0.955 for prostate cancer, 0.957 for lung can -\ncer, and 0.971 for the different cancer categories. This \nAI model also demonstrated its usefulness to nuclear \nmedicine practitioners by delivering prompt and precise \nassessments of cancerous bone metastasis, which ulti -\nmately proved advantageous [50, 61].\nWeight‑bearing computed tomography (WBCT)\nWeight-bearing computed tomography (WBCT) is a \npromising method for evaluating different lower-extrem -\nity deformities and ailments, such as knee osteoarthritis, \nankle arthritis, progressive collapsing foot deformity, \nand hallux valgus. WBCT provides more accurate bone-\npositioning measurements than conventional weight-\nbearing radiographs and non-weight-bearing CT scans. \nRecent advancements in this area focus on a three-\ndimensional approach, utilizing automated joint map -\nping and machine learning (ML)-based segmentation \ntechniques. AI-enhanced ChatGPT can be used in these \napplications [47].\nImplications of ChatGPT in orthopedic research\nAssistance in orthopedic research\nLLMs can assist researchers in generating clear and con -\ncise text, distilling large volumes of data, and performing \nvarious language-related tasks [32]. ChatGPT has made \nits way into scholarly writing, appearing in both preprints \nand published works. Although this undoubtedly ben -\nefits authors from various backgrounds, its advantages \nand disadvantages must be analyzed in the context of \nmedical research [62]. The widespread use of ChatGPT \nhas significantly disrupted the scientific community and \nsparked debates about the moral ramifications of using \nartificial intelligence (AI) to write scientific papers that \ncould impact the decisions of policymakers, scientists, \nand medical professionals [63, 64]. However, whether to \nallow “it” to be a co-author on scientific publications has \nprovoked heated debates [53, 65].\nDomain‑specific ChatGPT in orthopedic research\nThe exploration of several domain-specific ChatGPT \nindicates that they have the potential to significantly \nenhance orthopedic research, assisting in tasks ranging \nfrom literature review and data analysis to hypothesis \ngeneration and conclusions. However, the specific poten-\ntial challenges and limitations associated with the use of \nChatGPT in orthopedic research must be acknowledged. \nThe model’s responses may require more context-specific \nknowledge and expertise from experienced orthopedic \nspecialists to avoid errors or incomplete information.\nDrawbacks and limitations\nWhether AI should be implemented into decision sup -\nport systems has been a topic of discussion for several \nyears [66]. As AI is increasingly used in radiology and \northopedic traumatology, several areas will be of great \nvalue in the future [4]. As is generally acknowledged, \nusing AI in radiology and other image-based fields \nincreases diagnostic precision [56]. However, before \nbeing included in clinical decision support systems, these \ntools must be carefully analyzed and interpreted [67, \n68]. In addition, ChatGPT has identified many barriers \nand limitations affecting the successful incorporation \nof AI into surgical practice. These include lack of data \nPage 8 of 10Chatterjee et al. Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics          (2023) 10:128 \navailability, ethical concerns, complexity of surgical pro -\ncedures, opposition to change, and budgetary limitations. \nThese elements align with previous studies and scholarly \ndiscussions in this area, thus providing a thorough pic -\nture of the potential barriers to the practical application \nof AI in surgery [34, 40]. Moreover, concerns regarding \nthe potential bias in ChatGPT resulting from training \ndatasets need to be addressed. These biases could limit \ntheir skills and result in factual mistakes, a worrying con -\ndition known as hallucinations, in which results seem \nscientifically logical but may not be accurate. In addi -\ntion, security concerns and the possibility of cyberattacks \ninvolving the spread of false materials via LLMs must be \nconsidered [60].\nChatGPT has attracted attention for several issues that \ncould arise from the broad use of AI in surgical settings. \nThese concerns include job losses, moral reasons, legal \nconcerns, dependence on technology, and financial rami -\nfications. These issues highlight the importance of care -\nfully considering AI’s potential effects and consequences \nin surgery, and developing solutions for any problems \nthat may arise [30]. However, the LLMs and ChatGPT \nprovided inappropriate content and information (Fig.  3). \nTherefore, an AI-based LLM model should be adequately \ntrained with the appropriate medical content to provide \nerror-free and accurate medical information.\nEthical concern\nFollowing the pandemic, medical chatbots have made \nconsiderable strides as patient communication tools. \nMedical ethicists have accelerated the development \nand application of ethical standards to control trans -\nformative innovation. Medical chatbots face several \nlegal and ethical difficulties that need to be addressed \nand resolved [48]. Owing to ChatGPT’s lack of wide -\nspread adoption in other medical applications, most \nscholarly research is focused primarily on ethical issues \nsurrounding its use in medical contexts. Although \nChatGPT reduces plagiarism, it requires human edit -\ning. Additionally, the validity of works produced by \nChatGPT for personal remarks or letters of reference \nis questionable [5 ]. Additionally, AI-generated text \nmust be ensured not to violate any existing copyrights \nbefore it is used for commercial purposes. Publish -\ners and preprint servers claim that ChatGPT cannot \nbe regarded as a study author because it is unable to \nassume responsibility for the veracity and legitimacy of \nscientific research, according to the Nature news team \n[13]. The ethical implications of ChatGPT for users \nmust be investigated continuously and methodically. \nThus, international collaboration must be promoted \nto establish a global ethical framework controlling the \nuse of ChatGPT as a medical chatbot. The effective \nresolution of cybersecurity, privacy, seamless integra -\ntion, and data content challenges relies heavily on the \ncooperation of diverse stakeholders, including medical \npractitioners, patients, hospital delegates, and com -\nputer security experts. Their joint efforts should con -\ncentrate on developing regulations for patient data \nownership and security [69]. Thus, by addressing its \ndifficulties and moral consequences, researchers can \nethically use AI to further human understanding and \nknowledge. This strategy enhances the performance, \nusability, and overall user experience of ChatGPT and \nrelated conversational AI models across a range of \ndomains and applications [70].\nConclusions\nThe cutting-edge language models have expanded the \npossibilities for medical professionals and patients, \naltered surgical procedures, and increased education. \nIt has developed into a priceless resource that provides \nimmediate access to the information and experiences of \northopedic students and professionals. It can read intri -\ncate medical literature, examine patient data, and provide \nsuggestions based on solid facts. Although there is great \npotential for using AI models such as ChatGPT in ortho -\npedic research and surgery planning, several important \nissues must first be addressed. These include ensuring \ndata privacy, mitigating bias, and establishing responsi -\nbility. By doing this, moral norms can be respected and \negalitarian healthcare practices can be encouraged while \nutilizing the full potential of these AI technologies in \northopedics. For AI models, such as ChatGPT, continu -\nous updates and enhancements are required to continue \nto be effective in orthopedic research. AI models must be \ncontinually trained on the most recent information and \ndevelopments as the field of orthopedics develops with \nnew techniques, treatments, and research. These models \nneed to be kept current to provide orthopedic surgeons \nwith precise and up-to-date advice. The focus must be on \ndiminishing the growing gap between AI, LLM techno -\nlogical capabilities, and orthopedic professionals, such \nas doctors, surgeons, and researchers. Simultaneously, \northopedic doctors and surgeons must adopt next-gener-\nation LLMs to obtain a better clinical perspective. Thus, \nthe primary objective of this study was to examine the \ndiverse applications of ChatGPT and LLMs in the field of \northopedics, including education, surgery, and research. \nFurther, this study sought to illustrate how these \nadvanced language models can be utilized to enhance \northopedic practices, from facilitating education and \nsurgical planning to supporting scientific research and \ndata management. This article was written for healthcare \nPage 9 of 10\nChatterjee et al. Journal of Experimental Orthopaedics          (2023) 10:128 \n \nservice providers, doctors, patients, researchers, and \nstudents involved in orthopedic research. Although \nLLMs and ChatGPT may not be able to replace doctors, \nthey can provide satisfactory information, knowledge, \nand guidance, which are of great assistance to patients, \ndoctors, healthcare service providers, and researchers. \nThis study can serve as a guide and help the concerned \nauthorities, such as doctors and researchers, by easing \nthe process to a certain extent when using LLMs and \nChatGPT appropriately. When using these LLMs and \nChatGPT, their limitations must be considered to ensure \naccurate results.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was supported by Hallym University Research Fund and by Basic \nScience Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea \n(NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF‑ 2020R1I1A3074575).\nAuthors’ contributions\nSC: original draft writing, editing, CC: conceptualization, original draft writing, \nreview and editing.
