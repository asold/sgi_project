  "abstract": "Malfunctions in relay protection devices are predominantly caused by current transformer (CT) saturation which produces distortion in current measurements and disturbances in power system protection. The development of deep learning in power system protection is on the rise recently because of its robustness. This study presents a CT saturation detection where the secondary current becomes distorted. The proposed scheme offers a wide range of saturation detection and consists of a moving-window technique and stacked denoising autoencoders. Moreover, Bayesian optimization was used to minimize the difficulty of determining neural network structure for the proposed approach. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated for a-g faults on 154 kV and 345 kV overhead transmission line in South Korea. The waveform variation has been generated by PSCAD for different scenarios that heavily influence CT saturation. Moreover, a comparative analysis with other methods demonstrated the superiority of the proposed DNN method. With the proposed algorithm to detect CT saturation, it significantly yielded high accuracy and precision for CT saturation detection which were approximately 99.71% and 99.32%, respectively.",
