R. China\nAbstract\nIn this note we revisit the Lin, Lunin, Maldacena (LLM) class of d = 11\nsupergravity solutions with symmetry SO(6)×SO(3)×R, but generalise\nto allow for all ﬂuxes consistent with the isometries. Using the Killing\nspinor equation, we prove there are no supersymmetric geometrie s with\nadditional ﬂuxes beyond the LLM ansatz. In addition, the LLM relat ion-\nship between Killing spinors, ǫ− = −γ5ǫ+, may be seen as a consequence\nof identifying two Killing directions identiﬁed through the Killing spinor\nequation corresponding to candidate R-symmetry directions.\n1 Introduction\nA reputed most general gravity solution of eleven dimensional supe rgravity which\npreserves N = 2 superconformal symmetry was constructed in [1]. Despite the\ncommonly held belief that it is the most general class of solutions, a qu estion exists\nover the existence of solutions with an additional ﬂux term. If such a supersymmetry\npreserving ﬂux term could be incorporated into the ansatz, then it raises pressing\nquestions about the ﬁeld theory interpretation, and with the rece nt interest in dual\ngeometries (e.g. [2]), a thorough analysis is well overdue. In this not e we address\nthat question by adopting the same S5 ×S2 ×M4 ansatz as LLM 1, but in contrast we\ntreat the two Killing spinors ǫ+, ǫ− on the spacetime M4 independently to see how\nthe Killing spinor equation (KSE) constrains the geometry. We begin b y reviewing\nthe arguments and assumptions of LLM [1].\nWe recall that [1] argued that the presence of a four-form ﬂux te rm G, propor-\ntional to the volume of the external spacetime M4, should be set to zero to avoid\nspheres shrinking in an irregular fashion. The reason being that ﬂux density would\ndiverge at the points where the spheres shrink. Once this simpliﬁcat ion is adopted,\nit was subsequently noted that the Killing spinor equations simplify into two decou-\npled systems for the linear combinations ǫ− ±γ5ǫ+. A choice of sign ǫ− = −γ5ǫ+ then\nleaves one with a single independent spinor and generates the geome try through the\npowerful techniques of G-structures (see [3, 4] for similar exam ples with less super-\nsymmetry and d = 4 dual SCFTs). The authors ﬁnally show that starting from the\nLLM class of solutions, one cannot perturbatively turn on G, however this does not\nrule out geometries where G exists and cannot be set to zero. The aim of this work\nis to challenge the generality of these assumptions by relaxing them.\nOur work builds on the KSE decomposition presented in [1] by retainin g G and\ntreating ǫ+ and ǫ− initially in an independent fashion, though of course they will be\nrelated through supersymmetry. While our approach does have so me overlap with\nthe work of [4], we follow largely in the footsteps of a classiﬁcation of AdS3 × S2 ge-\nometries with SU (2)-structure dual to chiral N = (4 , 0) SCFTs [5], though here the\nspace to be determined is of dimension four and not six, leading to a sim pliﬁcation\nand more generality. In other words, as we are working in four-dime nsions, one can\nassume that a generic Killing spinor ǫ+ (non-chiral, non-Majorana) may be related\nto another ǫ− simply through complex functions ai such that\nǫ− =\n4∑\ni=1\naiηi, where ηi ∈ { ǫ+, γ5ǫ+, ǫc\n+, γ5ǫc\n+}. (1.1)\n1The S5 is easily analytically continued toAdS5 as explained in [1].\n1\nOur strategy for determining the ai will hinge largely on the algebraic constraints\narising from the KSE. These place strong constraints on the scalar and vector bi-\nlinears one may construct from the Killing spinors. Though one may de rive many\nconstraints, the ones we present later are suﬃcient for our purp oses. In the present\nsetting of the LLM ansatz one also beneﬁts from a particular linear c ombination of\nthe algebraic constraints in which a two-form ﬂux term F on M4 does not appear\n[1]. We will see in the ﬁrst half of this note that if one insists on G ̸= 0, then there is\nno non-trivial solution to the KSE. However, when one sets G to zero, it is possible\nto ask if the choice ǫ− = −γ5ǫ+ is the most general consistent with the ansatz and\nsupersymmetry. We show that if the two Killing directions we note late r in the text\nare identiﬁed 2, so that they correspond to the R-symmetry, as in the case of LLM,\nthen this relationship is the only possibility.\n2 Warm-up\nWe begin this section by reviewing the ansatz of LLM [1]. The d = 11 supergravity\nansatz may be written as a warped product of S5, S2 and a non-compact M4\nspacetime,\nds2 = e2λ\n[ 1\nm2 dΩ 2\n5 + e2AdΩ 2\n2 + ds2\nM4\n]\n,\nF (4) = G + vol(S2) ∧ F , (2.1)\nwhere λ, A are functions only of the coordinates on M4 and F and G are respectively\n2-forms and 4-forms on M4. The Bianchi identity will be satisﬁed through the\nclosure of these forms, while the ﬂux equations of motion are\nd(e3λ+2A ∗4 G) = 0 ,\nd(e3λ−2A ∗4 F) = 0 . (2.2)\nProvided these equations of motion are satisﬁed, it is at this stage w ell established\nthat Einstein equations follow from integrability of the KSE [7], a fact that guaran-\ntees the existence of a genuine d = 11 supergravity solution.\nWe next reproduce the results of the Killing spinor decomposition, th e details\nof which may be found in appendix F of [1], to get the following equations in our\n2See [6] for a recent study of LLM geometries with an additionalU(1) isometry.\n2\nnotation:\n(\nγµ ∂µ λ − i\n6e−6λ−2AIγ5\n)\nǫ± ∓\n( 1\n12e−3λ−2Aγµν Fµν + mγ5\n)\nǫ∓ = 0 , (2.3)\n(\n±ie−Aγ5 + γµ ∂µ A\n)\nǫ± ±\n(\nmγ5 + 1\n4e−3λ−2Aγµν Fµν\n)\nǫ∓ = 0 , (2.4)\n(\n∇µ − i\n4γ5γµ e−6λ−2AI\n)\nǫ± ±\n( m\n2 γµ γ5 + 1\n4e−3λ−2Aγν Fµν\n)\nǫ∓ = 0 . (2.5)\nA linear combination of (2.3) and (2.4) leads to an algebraic condition ind ependent\nof F (\nγµ ∂µ (3λ + A) ± ie−Aγ5 − i\n2e−6λ−2AIγ5\n)\nǫ± ∓ 2mγ5ǫ∓ = 0 . (2.6)\nNote as in LLM, we have also imposed the equations of motion on G through\nthe redeﬁnition\nG = e−3λ−2AIvol(M4), (2.7)\nwhere I is now simply the constant appearing in the above equations.\nBefore proceeding with the analysis, consistent with the conventio ns of LLM\n(appendix A) 3, we start by making an exhaustive list of the scalars\nS1 = i\n2(¯ǫ+ǫ+ + ¯ǫ−ǫ−), S 2 = i\n2(¯ǫ+ǫ+ − ¯ǫ−ǫ−), S 3 = ¯ǫ+ǫ−,\nT1 = 1\n2(¯ǫ+γ5ǫ+ + ¯ǫ−γ5ǫ−), T 2 = 1\n2(¯ǫ+γ5ǫ+ − ¯ǫ−γ5ǫ−), T 3 = ¯ǫ+γ5ǫ−,\nU1 = ¯ ǫc\n+ǫ−, U 2 = ¯ǫc\n+γ5ǫ−, (2.8)\nand the vectors\nK1\nµ = 1\n2 (¯ǫ+γµ ǫ+ + ¯ǫ−γµ ǫ−), K 2\nµ = 1\n2 (¯ǫ+γµ ǫ+ − ¯ǫ−γµ ǫ−)\nK3\nµ = 1\n2 (¯ǫ+γ5γµ ǫ+ + ¯ǫ−γ5γµ ǫ−), K 4\nµ = 1\n2 (¯ǫ+γ5γµ ǫ+ − ¯ǫ−γ5γµ ǫ−),\nK5\nµ = 1\n2 (¯ǫc\n+γµ ǫ+ + ¯ǫc\n−γµ ǫ−), K 6\nµ = 1\n2 (¯ǫc\n+γµ ǫ+ − ¯ǫc\n−γµ ǫ−),\nK7\nµ = ¯ ǫ+γµ ǫ−, K 8\nµ = ¯ǫ+γ5γµ ǫ−,\nK9\nµ = ¯ ǫc\n+γµ ǫ−, K 10\nµ = ¯ǫc\n+γ5γµ ǫ−. (2.9)\nthat will appear later. The omitted scalar and vector bilinears may be shown to\nbe zero by employing the symmetry properties of the gamma matrice s. It should\nbe borne in mind that depending on the choice of ǫ+, ǫ−, some of these bilinears\nwill be trivially zero. As we are also working in four dimensions, we expec t that\nthese vectors are related - they cannot be independent. In fact , some relationships\n3We are grateful for correspondence with Oleg Lunin on this matter.\n3\nbetween them may be deduced by playing around with the algebraic co nstraints.\nThe results of some of those eﬀorts we will see later.\nAs the sight of all these bilinears may be a bit overwhelming, it is helpful to\norient ourselves by recording the non-zero bilinears in the case of L LM i.e when\nǫ− = −γ5ǫ+. For LLM only the following scalars\nT3 = iS2 = i, S 3 = −T2 = sinh ζ, (2.10)\nand vectors\nK1 = K8 = −1\n2 K, K 3 = K7 = − 1\n2m L, K 6 = K10 = −ω, (2.11)\nare non-zero. Here we have written the non-zero bilinears in the no tation of [1].\nWe begin by using (2.6) and the symmetry properties of the gamma ma trices to\nderive some constraints linking the various scalars 4:\n2mS2 + e−Aℜ(S3) = 0 , (2.12)\nℑ(S3) = 0 , (2.13)\n4mT1 + e−6λ−2AIℑ(T3) = 0 , (2.14)\nK1 · d(3λ + A) = 0 , (2.15)\n2T1 − e−6λ−AIT2 = 0 , (2.16)\n2e−AT2 − e−6l−2AIT1 − 4mℑ(T3) = 0 , (2.17)\nU1 = 0 . (2.18)\nAs with all the relationships presented in this note, a valuable consist ency check is\nprovided by checking against LLM.\nHowever, the important point not to be overlooked here is that with out doing\nmuch work, we have already arrived at a diﬀerent perspective of ho w the KSE\nconstrains the geometry. If one follows the analysis of LLM, one is le ft with the\nimpression that one ﬁrst needs to set I = 0 before one imposes ǫ− = −γ5ǫ+ to\nsimplify the KSE. However, by rewriting the information inherent in th e algebraic\nconstraints in terms of bilinears, we immediately see that I = 0 follows from the\nrelationship between the spinors. This is evident from (2.16) where T1 is zero for\nLLM, while T2 is non-zero.\nIn addition, the following list can be found from manipulating (2.3):\nℜ(T3)I = 0 , (2.19)\nT2I = 0 , (2.20)\nK1 · dλ = 0 . (2.21)\n4Here we employ the notationA · B ≡ Aµ Bµ and henceforth ℜ and ℑ will denote real and\nimaginary parts of expressions.\n4\nAt this early stage, we are also seeing evidence of the direction K1 emerging\nas a Killing direction, since it may be noted that the warp factors λ and A are\nindependent of K1. Combining some of the above equations, it is possible to infer\nthat\nT1 = Iℑ(T3) = 0 . (2.22)\nSo far, we have made use of the algebraic constraints, but one can also use the\ndiﬀerential equation to write out torsion conditions for the scalars\nd(e−AS1) = −1\n2 e6l−3AIK3 + e−2AK4, (2.23)\ndS2 = −1\n2 e6l−2AIK4, (2.24)\nd(e−AT2) = 0 , (2.25)\nd(e−Aℜ(T3)) = −e−2Aℑ(K7), (2.26)\ndℑ(T3) = 0 , (2.27)\ndU2 = = −mK5, (2.28)\nwhich are all satisﬁed for LLM. From here we see that ℑ(T3) is a constant, which we\nhenceforth denote t. Similarly, one can derive algebraic and diﬀerential relationships\nfor the vectors. Despite only having four directions, we see from t he text that one\ncan deﬁne ten vectors. As they cannot all be independent, we not e the following\nrelations for the vectors:\nIK10 = 0 , (2.29)\nT2d(3λ + A) + 2 mℜ(K7) = 0 , (2.30)\n−ℜ(T3)d(3λ + A) + e−Aℑ(K7) + 2 mK2 = 0 , (2.31)\n−2S1d(3λ + A) + e−6λ−2AIK3 − 2e−AK4 + 4mℑ(K8) = 0 , (2.32)\n2S2d(3λ + A) − e−6λ−2AIK4 + 2e−AK3 = 0 , (2.33)\n2ℑ(S3)d(3λ + A) + e−6λ−2AIℜ(K8) = 0 , (2.34)\n−2ℜ(S3)d(3λ + A) + e−6λ−2AIℑ(K8) + 4 mK3 = 0 , (2.35)\n2mK5 − ie−AK9 − U2d(3λ + A) = 0 . (2.36)\nOne may also derive the torsion conditions for the vectors which we r ecord in the\nappendix. These vector torsion conditions complete the geometric data required to\nconstruct a geometry by relating the ﬂuxes F and I to vectors appearing in the\nmetric.\n5\n2.1 Killing directions\nThe Killing directions from the possible list of vectors KA may be determined by\nusing (2.5) to determine ∇µ KA\nν and inspecting whether the symmetric part vanishes\nor not. As was observed in [5], when one treats the Killing spinors on an independent\nfooting, it is not too surprising to ﬁnd additional Killing directions. It m ay be\nconﬁrmed that the two solutions to the Killing equation\n∇(µ KA\nν) = 0 (2.37)\nare K1 and ℜ(K8). We stress that this is a general result, irrespective of whether I\nis zero or not, though ℜ(K8) requires ℑ(S3) = 0 for it to be a solution. Fortunately,\nthis is the case as may be conﬁrmed from (2.13).\nWe now show that both these directions are isometries of the full so lution by\nshowing that the Lie derivatives LX ≡ iX d + diX of the warp factors λ and A and\nthe ﬂux terms F and G with respect to X ∈ { K1, ℜ(K8)} are zero. Firstly it is easy\nto show from any of (2.3), (2.4) or (2.6) that\nLK1 λ = LK1 A = 0 , (2.38)\nand similarly for ℜ(K8).\nNow we would like to show that the Lie derivative of the ﬂux term F is also zero\nw.r.t. K1 and ℜ(K8). It is easy to show using (2.4) that\niK1 F = −2e3λ+2A [\nℜ(S3)dA + mK3]\n,\niℜ(K8)F = 2 e3λ+A [\nT2dA − mℜ(K7)\n]\n. (2.39)\nTaking a derivative and using (2.12), (2.30) and (2.33) we ﬁnd the follo wing\nLK1 F = −2me−Ad(3λ + A) ∧ K3, (2.40)\nLℜ(K8)F = 0 . (2.41)\nThough the second line might be expected, the ﬁrst line which is trivially zero for\nLLM has to be set to zero if we are to consider K1 to be a symmetry of the complete\nsolution. This in turn tells us that d(3λ + A) is a form in the K3 direction. After\neliminating the possibility of non-zero I in the next section, K1 will become an\nisometry of the full solution. This may be seen clearly from (2.33) whe re with I = 0\nand non-zero S2, d(3λ + A) is along the K3 direction.\nFinally, one may want to show that the Lie derivative of G = e−3λ−2AIvol(M4)\nis zero. This may be easily done by taking the Hodge dual, in which case, the result\nis immediate using the fact that I is constant and the warp factors are independent\nof the Killing directions (2.38).\n6\n3 No geometries with I\nHaving established some algebraic and diﬀerential relationships betw een the bilinears\narising from the KSE, we are now in a ﬁt position to comment on this cas e. When\nI is non-zero, we necessarily have to set the following bilinears to zero :\nT1 = ℑ(S3) = U1 = 0 (3.1)\nT2 = T3 = K2 = K7 = ℜ(K8) = K10 = 0 . (3.2)\nThe ﬁrst line here is true in general i.e. for all geometries, while the se cond line\nfollows as a result of insisting that I be non-zero. In deducing that the above vectors\nare zero, we have utilised (2.26), (2.29), (2.30), (2.31) and (2.34). In retaining I, we\nhave been forced to set to zero bilinears that are non-zero for LL M, so there is no\nway to reconcile the LLM class of solutions in [1] with I.\nIt is also worth noting that through naive counting, we have 16 real components\nof ǫ+, ǫ− to be determined, while we have ﬁve scalar and four vector constra ints\nmaking a total of twenty-one real constraints, therefore sugg esting the system is\noverconstrained. Indeed, it is a straightforward, but lengthy ex ercise in linear algebra\nto show that the only solution to the above constraints is ǫ+ = ǫ− = 0. This may be\nmost easily done by introducing an explicit representation for the ga mma matrices as\nin the appendix and then writing ǫ+ and ǫ− in terms of general complex components.\nWe are thus led to the following conclusion:\nThere are no supersymmetric geometries within the LLM warped product\nansatz with non-zeroI.\nThis unequivocal statement improves on the analysis in [1] where it wa s shown\nthat I could not be turned on perturbatively from the known class of solut ions.\nThis did not rule out the existence of I completely as we have done here.\n4 Geometries generalising LLM\nIn this section we turn our focus to the relationship between the sp inors ǫ− =\n−γ5ǫ+ to investigate to what extent it is determined by supersymmetry. O ne naively\nimagines, if one relaxes it, there is a small chance that more bilinears m ay be turned\non in a way that leads to a generalisation. To extract suﬃcient inform ation about\nthe geometry to make a deﬁnite statement, we opt to initially study t he algebraic\nFierz identities.\n7\nFollowing [4] one can expand in terms of another basis of generic spino rs ηa ∈\n{ǫ+, ǫ−ǫc\n+, ǫc\n−} and construct the identity operator\n1 = ηa(m−1)ab ¯ηb, (4.1)\nwhere mab = ¯ηaηb. One may now use this completeness relation and (2.6) with I = 0\nto write\nγµ ∂µ (3λ + A) = Σ c\na (m−1)abηc ¯ηb. (4.2)\nPerforming Fierz identities on ηc ¯ηb one ﬁnds that the γµ coeﬃcient gives the following\nuseful relationship:\nd(3λ + A)\n[\nS2\n2 − S2\n1 + |S3|2]\n=\n{\ne−AS1K4 + (2mS3 − e−AS2)K3 − 2mS1ℑ(K8)\n}\n(4.3)\nNote the 1 and γ5γµ coeﬃcients recover (2.17) and (2.12) respectively, while γ5\ncoeﬃcient is trivially satisﬁed. One may also extract information from the γµν\ncoeﬃcient, but the relationship is in terms of 2-forms which we ﬁnd les s useful.\nMoreover, one may repeat with the other algebraic constraints fr om the KSE, but\none recovers known relationships for the scalars and vectors.\nNote also now for K1 to be an isometry of the overall solution, we require d(3l +\nA) ∧ K3 = 0 which as we have seen is true when I = 0. This in turn implies from\n(4.3) that\nsK4 − 2meAℑ(K8) = S1K3, (4.4)\nwhere we have determined the factor on the right hand side by using the vector iden-\ntity (2.31). The outstanding independent vector identities may the n be expressed\nas\nsd(3λ + A) + e−AK3 = 0 ,\nsℜ(K7) − tK3 = 0 ,\nℜ(T3)K3 + sℑ(K7) + 2 mseAK2 = 0 ,\nU2K3 + 2mseAK5 − isK9 = 0 , (4.5)\nwhere we have eliminated factors of d(3λ + A) which are non-zero in general. As\nS2 is a constant when I = 0, in addition to the constant ℑ(T3) = t, we also have\nS2 = s. Both these constants we take to be real and non-zero as is the c ase in LLM.\nWith the above relations between the vectors (4.4) and (4.5) derive d from su-\npersymmetry, we are now in an adequate position to address wheth er there is a\ngeneralisation within the LLM class of solutions. Some details may be fo und in\nappendix B, so here we just present an overview of the arguments .\n8\nWe now consider ǫ+ to be generic as in LLM, but allow for it to be related to ǫ−\nthrough complex functions a, b, c, d\nǫ− = aǫ+ + bγ5ǫ+ + cǫc\n+ + dγ5ǫc\n+. (4.6)\nNote as we are only expecting one Killing direction from M4 corresponding to\nthe R-symmetry5, it is most natural that K1 and ℜ(K8) should be the same 6. As we\nhave seen earlier in (2.11), this is true for LLM. Note also from (2.11) that setting\none of these vectors to zero, takes one out of the LLM class of so lutions. In addition,\none may imagine that some linear combination of these two vectors co uld be an R-\nsymmetry direction, while another may correspond to a normal isom etry direction.\nIt would be interesting to explore this option, but it would take us out of the LLM\nclass, so we do not consider this possibility here.\nThe strategy then is to simply plug this expression for ǫ− into the above vector\nconditions, while also taking into account the scalar constraints:\nT1 = ℑ(S3) = U1 = 0 ,\n0 = 2 ms + e−AS3,\n0 = T2 − 2meAt. (4.7)\nOne then ﬁnds a series of equations in terms of the original scalars a nd vectors\n(K, L, ω ) of LLM - we are assuming these are not trivially zero, so that any so lution\nto the KSE will include the solution presented in [1]. As it is possible to use the\nFierz identities to show that K, L and ω are orthogonal, K · L = K · ω = L · ω = 0,\none can use them as a basis to expand the vector identities above. B y identifying\ntheir coeﬃcients, one is lead to a collection of algebraic equations on a, b, c and d.\nIt is possible to quickly see that the condition K1 = ℜ(K8) is very strong. In\nterms of component vectors one ﬁnds the following relationships am ong a, b, c, d :\nℜ(b) = −1\n2(|a|2 + |b|2 + |c|2 + |d|2 + 1),\nℜ(a) = −ℜ(a∗b − c∗d),\nd = −(a∗c + b∗d). (4.8)\nThen using the vector torsion identities (C.1) and (C.8) and the fact that terms\nproportional to m and F will in general vanish independently, one ﬁnds another set\n5Typically inAdS × M geometries with enough supersymmetry, if anR-symmetry is expected,\nthen it must come out from the Killing spinors.\n6They can be related up to a constant and the result is unchanged.\n9\nof identities:\ns = t,\nℜ(b) = −1\n2(1 − |a|2 + |b|2 − |c|2 + |d|2),\nℑ(a) = ℑ(a∗b + c∗d),\nc = a∗d − b∗c,\nd = a∗c − b∗d. (4.9)\nWe can reconcile these two only when a = c = 0. Now, it is a simple task to use the\nscalar constraints as rewritten in appendix B to see that the only so lution is\na = c = d = 0 , b = −1. (4.10)\nIn other words, it appears that the most general relationship bet ween the Killing\nspinors permitted by supersymmetry is ǫ− = −γ5ǫ+, so it appears that there is no\nway to generalise the LLM solution when I = 0 by relaxing the original relationship\nassumed in [1]. Interestingly, this result is an immediate consequence of identify-\ning the two Killing directions K1 and ℜ(K8). It is certainly interesting to see if\nthere are any geometries with non-parallel K1 and ℜ(K8). It is possible that such\nsupersymmetric geometries are all maximally supersymmetric.\nIn conclusion, we have examined the assumptions leading to the LLM c lass of\nsolutions in M-theory using Killing spinor bilinears and the KSE. In this lan guage\nit is easy to see that there are no supersymmetric solutions with I and when one\nsets this ﬂux term to zero, there is no more general class of LLM so lutions.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Oleg Lunin for helpful and supportive comments both at the start\nand end of this project.

Here we provide a brief summary. On the external space M4 with signature\n10\n(−, +, +, +) we will take ǫ0123 = 1. As a result, deﬁning γ5 = iγ0123, we have\nγ2\n5 = +1. We will then adopt\n(γ0)† = −γ0, (γi)† = γi, (A.1)\nAlso from LLM [1], we see that the intertwiners A and C are given by\nA ≡ γ0, C ≡ γ2. (A.2)\nFrom (A.1) this means that\nAγµ A−1 = −γ†\nµ . (A.3)\nIn LLM γ2 is antisymmetric and γ0, γ1, γ3 symmetric so that\nC−1γT\nµ C = −γµ . (A.4)\nNote that subject to these choices\nγ†\n5 = γ5, γ T\n5 = −γ5. (A.5)\nThen deﬁning D = CAT in the usual fashion, we can deﬁne the conjugate spinor\nto ǫ as ǫc = Dǫ∗ = γ2γ0ǫ∗. This implies that ¯ ǫc = −ǫT γ2. Note also that D = γ2γ0\nand that DD∗ = +1, so that we have the freedom to take ǫ to be a Majorana spinor\nprovided we impose ǫc = ǫ.\nGiven spinors χ, ξ and spinor bilinears constructed from p antisymmetrised gamma\nmatrices γ(p) ≡ γµ 1···µ p , we have the following symmetry properties for the spinor\nbilinears\n( ¯χγ(p)ξ)† = ( −1)\np(p+1)\n2 +1 ¯ξγ(p)χ,\n( ¯χcγ(p)ξ)T = ( −1)\np(p+1)\n2 +1 ¯ξcγ(p)χ. (A.6)\nFinally, an explicit representation of the above γ matrices may be written:\nγ0 = 1 ⊗ iσ3, γ 1 = 1 ⊗ σ1, γ 2 = σ1 ⊗ σ2, γ 3 = σ2 ⊗ σ2. (A.7)\nEmploying this choice γ5 ≡ iγ0123 = σ3 ⊗ σ2.\nB Relaxing LLM Killing spinor relation\nIn this appendix we present some relationships that are useful in de termining ǫ− =\n−γ5ǫ+ from the identities we have derived in section 4, namely (4.4), (4.5) an d (4.7).\n11\nAs explained in the text, given two generic spinors in four-dimensions , they can be\nrelated via\nǫ− = aǫ+ + bγ5ǫ+ + cǫc\n+ + dγ5ǫc\n+, (B.1)\nwhere a, b, c, d are complex-valued functions. Slotting this expression for ǫ− into the\nscalar equations (4.7), they may be rewritten as\nf1(−1 + |a|2 − |b|2 − |c|2 + |d|2) + 2 f2ℑ(a∗b − c∗d) − 2s = 0 , (B.2)\nif1c + f2d = 0 , (B.3)\niaf1 + bf2 + 2mseA = 0 , (B.4)\nf2 − 2mteA = 0 , (B.5)\nf2ℑ(a) + f1ℜ(b) − t = 0 , (B.6)\nf2(1 + |a|2 − |b|2 − |c|2 + |d|2) − 2f1ℑ(a∗b − c∗d) = 0 . (B.7)\nHere we have introduced the added notation ¯ ǫ+ǫ+ = −¯ǫc\n+ǫc\n+ = if1 and ¯ǫ+γ5ǫ+ =\n−¯ǫc\n+γ5ǫc\n+ = f2, with fi ∈ R. Note that (B.3) to (B.6) may be satisﬁed if\nb = −s\nt + i ˜da, (B.8)\nwhere we have deﬁned a new real function ˜d = −f1/f2. Note that this function is\nnon-zero in LLM.\nMoving along to the vector expressions, (4.4) and (4.5), we can writ e all the\nvector expressions in terms of the vectors in LLM [1] as they cons titute a basis.\nThey may be written\nKµ = −2¯ǫ+γµ ǫ+ = −2¯ǫc\n+γµ ǫc\n+ (B.9)\nLµ = −2m¯ǫ+γ5γµ ǫ+ = 2 m¯ǫc\n+γ5γµ ǫc\n+ (B.10)\nω = −¯ǫc\n+γµ ǫ+ (B.11)\nIt is also easy to show that ω∗ = −¯ǫ+γµ ǫc\n+ and that\nK · L = K · ω = L · ω = 0 , (B.12)\nso they are all orthogonal and constitute a basis. It is useful to d ocument all the\n12\nvectors in our text KA in terms of the original LLM vectors and a, b, c, d as follow\nK1 + K2 = −1\n2K (B.13)\nK1 − K2 = −1\n2(|a|2 + |b|2 + |c|2 + |d|2)K + 1\nmℜ(a∗b − c∗d)L (B.14)\n−2ℜ ((a∗c + b∗d)ω∗) (B.15)\nK3 + K4 = − 1\n2mL (B.16)\nK3 − K4 = ℜ(a∗b + c∗d)K − 1\n2m(|a|2 + |b|2 − |c|2 − |d|2)L (B.17)\n+2ℜ ((a∗d + b∗c)ω∗) (B.18)\nK5 + K6 = −ω (B.19)\nK5 − K6 = ( bd − ac)K + 1\nm(bc − ad)L + (b2 − a2)ω + (d2 − c2)ω∗ (B.20)\nK7 = −1\n2aK + 1\n2mbL − cω∗ (B.21)\nK8 = 1\n2bK − 1\n2maL + dω∗ (B.22)\nK9 = −1\n2cK − 1\n2mdL − aω (B.23)\nK10 = 1\n2dK + 1\n2mcL + bω. (B.24)\nC Vector torsion conditions\nIn this section we illustrate the result of converting the KSE equatio ns into diﬀer-\nential conditions on the various vectors. Some of the expressions below allow one\nto determine an expression for the two-form ﬂux term F, thus completing the in-\nformation about the geometry. By using the KSE and the algebraic c onstraints on\n13\noccasion, one can rewrite the following vector torsion conditions:\ndK1 = e−6λ−2AI i\n4 [¯ǫ+γ5γµν ǫ+ + ¯ǫ−γ5γµν ǫ−] dxµν\n+ m\n2 [¯ǫ+γ5γµν ǫ− − ¯ǫ−γ5γµν ǫ+] dxµν − e−3λ−2Aℜ(S3)F, (C.1)\nd(e3λ K2) = e−3λ−2AI i\n8 [¯ǫ+γ5γµν ǫ+ − ¯ǫ−γ5γµν ǫ−] dxµν , (C.2)\nd(e−AK3) = 0 , (C.3)\ndK4 = m\n2 [¯ǫ+γµν ǫ− + ¯ǫ−γµν ǫ+] dxµν − e−3λ−2Aℜ(T3)F, (C.4)\ndK5 = e−6λ−2AI i\n4\n[\n¯ǫc\n+γ5γµν ǫ+ + ¯ǫc\n−γ5γµν ǫ−\n]\ndxµν , (C.5)\nd(e3λ K6) = e−3λ−2AI i\n8\n[\n¯ǫc\n+γ5γµν ǫ+ − ¯ǫc\n−γ5γµν ǫ−\n]\ndxµν\n− e3λ m\n4\n[\n¯ǫc\n+γ5γµν ǫ− + ¯ǫc\n−γ5γµν ǫ+\n]\ndxµν , (C.6)\ndK7 = e−6λ−2AI\n[i\n2 ℜ(¯ǫ+γ5γµν ǫ−) − 1\n4 ℑ(¯ǫ+γ5γµν ǫ−)\n]\ndxµν\n− m\n2 [¯ǫ+γ5γµν ǫ+ + ¯ǫ−γ5γµν ǫ−] dxµν − 3dλ ∧ ℜ(K7)\n− iS1F, (C.7)\ndK8 = −m\n2 [¯ǫ+γµν ǫ+ − ¯ǫ−γµν ǫ−] dxµν − 3idλ ∧ ℑ(K8)\n+ e−3λ−2AT2F, (C.8)\nd(e3lK9) = e−3λ−2AI i\n4 ¯ǫc\n+γ5γµν ǫ−dxµν\n+ e3λ m\n4\n[\n¯ǫc\n+γ5γµν ǫ+ − ¯ǫc\n−γ5γµν ǫ−\n]\ndxµν , (C.9)\nd(e−AK10) = −e−A m\n4\n[\n¯ǫc\n+γµν ǫ+ + ¯ǫc\n−γµν ǫ−\n]\ndxµν + e−2A i\n2 ¯ǫc\n+γµν ǫ−dxµν .(C.10)\nNote (C.1) & (C.8), (C.3) & (C.7), (C.6) are consistent with (F.25), (F .30),\n(F.70) of LLM [1] respectively. In contrast, (C.2), (C.4), (C.5), (C .7), (C.9) are\ntrivial for LLM. There is a factor of two diﬀerence between our F and that of LLM.\nAlso, we have made use of the following form notation:\nA ≡ 1\np! Ai1···ip dxi1···ip, (p-form),\ndxi1···ip ≡ dxi1 ∧ dxi2 ∧ · · · ∧ dxip . (C.11)\nReferences\n[1] H. Lin, O. Lunin and J. M.
