Qualitative coding can be a challenging process because it requires the\nresearcher to understand and analyze data that is often complex, nuanced, and open to multiple\ninterpretations. Multiple researchers need to spend a significant amount of time and effort to review\nthe data, develop a codebook that can accurately describe each label, and iteratively code the data\nuntil reaching a reasonable inter-rater agreement.

In this study, we explore a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to\nfacilitate qualitative coding.\nResearchers have built AI-based tools to assist qualitative analysis [7, 10–12]. These tools use\nnatural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to help researchers\nidentify patterns and themes in qualitative data. Two categories of models are often used, 1)\nunsupervised models, e.g., topic models, to help researchers discover themes, or 2) supervised\nmodels, e.g., logistic regression, to classify data into labels. However, both methods face their own\nchallenges. Unsupervised models are difficult to steer. It is difficult for researchers to use those\nmodels for their complex or nuanced research questions. And supervised models often require\nhigh-quality large datasets or computing resources to achieve reasonable performance. Therefore,\nmost of today’s qualitative coding still relies on manual effort.\nThe recent advent of LLMs (e.g., GPT-3 [2], PaLM [3], OPT [16]) offers new capabilities, including\ncreative writing [14], programming 1, etc. Unlike traditional task-specific models, LLMs accept\nnatural language prompts as input to perform various tasks [8]. For example, LLMs could perform\nclassification tasks if the prompt specifies a set of labels as the output space [ 4]. Compared to\nunsupervised models, the prompt could include specific instructions and examples (e.g., a codebook)\nto increase LLMs’ performance in a new task with unseen data in a zero-shot/few-shot fashion.\nPrior work shows that LLMs can be prompted to boost an NLG system’s performance by selecting\nbetter outputs from sampled candidates, according to some pre-defined metrics [15]. Since LLMs\noperate effectively with natural language input and do not require training datasets, they lower the\nbarriers for researchers without extensive AI expertise or resources to leverage AI capabilities in\ndata analysis (although many of today’s LLMs are proprietary).\nAlthough recent studies have demonstrated LLMs utility in many domains, studies have shown\nLLMs are error-prone and have limited capability in capturing language structure and nuanced\nmeanings [6], which are crucial in qualitative analysis. Therefore, in this preliminary study, we\nasked two research questions,\n•RQ1: To what extent does our LLM-based approach agree with experts in a deductive coding\ntask?\n•RQ2: How do different prompt designs affect the coding results?\nWe examined LLMs’ capability in facilitating a deductive coding task where we combined GPT-3\nwith expert-developed codebooks to analyze children’s curiosity-driven questions in terms of\nquestion complexity and syntactic structure. We found our proposed approach achieved fair to\nsubstantial agreements with experts (Question complexity: Cohen’s 𝜅 = 0.61; Syntactic Structure:\nCohen’s 𝜅 = 0.38). Based on our preliminary findings, we present challenges and opportunities for\nutilizing LLMs in qualitative analysis.\n2 DEDUCTIVE CODING TASK\nWe selected a deductive coding task as our starting point. The goal of deductive coding is to label\nthe data based on a codebook. It is a top-down process where the researchers start by developing a\ncodebook with an initial set of codes along with descriptions and examples based on the research\nfocus or theory [5]. Note that a coding process often involves both inductive coding (e.g. developing\nthe code book) and deductive coding (coding all the data according to a code book). Our approach\ncan be used to complete the second part or combined with the first part to help coders rapidly\niterate on their codebook.\n1https://github.com/features/copilot\n2\nSupporting Qualitative Analysis with Large Language Models IUI ’23 Companion, March 27–31, 2023, Sydney, NSW, Australia\n2.1 Case Study: Curiosity-driven questions Analysis\nWe examined our approach in analyzing children’s curiosity-driven questions. Understanding\nchildren’s ability to ask curiosity-driven questions informs psychologists of a child’s learning stage.\nWe looked at two dimensions of a curiosity-driven question, question complexity and syntactic\nstructure. The question complexity looks at if the answer to a question is a simple fact (e.g., “How big\nis a dinosaur?”) or requires explaining a mechanism, a relationship, etc.(e.g., “Why were dinosaurs\nso big?”) [13]. The syntactic structure has four categories, 1) ‘closed’ or declarative questions (e.g.,\n“Dinosaurs were big?”), 2) questions with questioning words in the middle of the sentence (e.g.,\n“The dinosaurs were how big?”), 3) questions without an interrogative formulation (e.g., “Why the\ndinosaurs are big?”), and 4) questions with a questioning word at the beginning of the sentence\nthat has interrogative syntax (e.g., “Why are dinosaurs big?”).\nWe collected a dataset with 668 children’s questions in French [1] 2. A team of psychologists\nhas developed a codebook and coded each question on the dimension of question complexity and\nsyntactic structure. Our chosen dimensions cover two main categories of deductive coding, binary\ncoding, and multi-level coding, with one focusing on the semantic meaning and the other looking\nat the syntactic structure. Additionally, the dataset and codebook have never been published online\nwhich is unseen by LLMs.\n3 GPT-3 SETUP AND PROMPT DESIGN\nWe chose GPT-3 (davinci-text-002) with a temperature of 0.0 during the prompting process, because\nit was the most advanced version of GPT-3 that was publicly available when we conducted the\nexperiments and 0.0 temperature (greedy decoding) guarantees the reproducibility of this study.\nWe explored two design dimensions of the prompt,\n•Codebook-centered vs. Example-centered: This dimension regards the structure of a prompt.\nIn the codebook-centered prompt, we designed the prompt similar to how researchers read a\ncodebook. The prompt follows the structure of [Code/ Description/ Examples]. For exam-\nple, Code: HIGH; Description: the answer to this question is not a simple fact but requires\nexplaining a mechanism, a relationship, etc.; Examples: Why were dinosaurs so big? The\nexample-centered approach is inspired by the in-context learning in recent LLM works\nwhere the prompt explains the rationale behind each example [8]. For example, “Why were\ndinosaurs so big?” is an example of “HIGH” because the answer to this question is not a sim-\nple fact but requires explaining a mechanism, a relationship, etc. The code, examples, and\ndescriptions are the same for both designs.\n•Zero-shot vs. One-shot vs. Few-shots: Since recent work showed conflicting results on the\nnumber of examples in a prompt [8], we explored different prompt settings. In the Zero-shot\nsetting, we give only Code and Description in Codebook-centered prompts 3. For the One-\nshot setting, we provided only one example for each code. And for the few-shot setting, we\nprovided five examples for each code.\nFor all prompt variants, we included an identity modifier, “I am a developmental psychologist\nwho has expertise in linguistics. ” and an instruction to constrain output space, “Choose from the\nfollowing candidates: [Code Set]”.\n2For question complexity, we first used GPT-3 to translate questions into English. For the syntactic structure, we kept\nquestions in French to preserve its syntactic structure.\n3Since the example-centered approach requires at least one example, we did not have the zero-shot setting for the example-\ncentered approach\n3\nIUI ’23 Companion, March 27–31, 2023, Sydney, NSW, Australia Xiao et al.\n0.0\n0.3\n0.5\n0.8\n1.0\nCodebook-based Example-based Expert\n0.52\n0.61\n0.88\n0.40\n0.60\n0.40\nZero-shot\nOne-shot\nFew-shot\n(a) Cohen’s 𝜅 for Question Complexity\n0.0\n0.3\n0.5\n0.8\n1.0\nCodebook-based Example-based Expert\n0.30\n0.35\n0.90\n0.13\n0.38\n0.11\n(b) Cohen’s 𝜅 for Syntactic Structure\nFig. 1. The Cohen’s 𝜅 between GPT-3 and experts shows substantial agreement in Question Complexity coding\nand fair agreement in Syntactic Structure coding. In general, Codebook-centered prompts with examples\nachieves the highest agreement.\n4 RESULTS\nWe measured the performance of our GPT-3 based approach with Cohen’s Kappa [ 9]. Cohen’s\nKappa measures inter-rater reliability, which indicates how two coders agree with each other. We\ncomputed two sets of Cohen’s Kappa, between GPT-3 with the expert’s final coding results and\nbetween two experts who originally coded the dataset using the same codebook.\nFor RQ1, our results suggest that it is feasible to use GPT-3 with an expert-developed codebook for\ndeductive coding. When analyzing curiosity-driven questions, our GPT-3-based approach achieved\nfair (Syntactic Structure: Cohen’s 𝜅 = 0.38) to substantial (Question complexity: Cohen’s 𝜅 = 0.61)\nagreement with expert rating (Cohen’s 𝜅’s interpretation is based on [ 9]), see Fig. 1. However,\nthere is a gap between experts’ agreement with our approach and the agreement among experts\n(Question complexity: Cohen’s 𝜅 = 0.88; Syntactic Structure: Cohen’s 𝜅 = 0.90).\nFor RQ2, we examined the different prompt designs. We found the codebook-centered design\nperforms better than the example-centered designs, see Fig. 1. And examples play an important role.\nWe observed the largest performance gain when shifting from a zero-shot to a one-shot setting.\nHowever, the performance between one-shot and few-shot settings did not differ much.\n5 OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES\nOur preliminary findings indicate the feasibility of using LLMs for qualitative analysis. In a deductive\ncoding task, by combining GPT-3 and a codebook, our LLM-based approach achieved fair to\nsubstantial agreement with experts. Considering the accessibility and flexibility of LLMs, we believe\nthis approach has the potential to effectively help researchers to analyze qualitative data, especially\nfor increasingly large datasets. We lay out a few challenges and opportunities for our future studies,\n•Interrogate Model Capability: In this preliminary exploration, we only measured the level of\nagreement. To better understand model capability, we ought to conduct more detailed error\nanalyses on disagreed items. Also, it is unclear if the LLM-based method could be extended\n4\nSupporting Qualitative Analysis with Large Language Models IUI ’23 Companion, March 27–31, 2023, Sydney, NSW, Australia\nto different contexts and different coding schemes where the coder needs to capture more\nnuanced signals.\n•Design for Appropriate Reliance: Although our preliminary results show fair to substantial\nagreement with expert rating, the model produces incorrect labels. When deploying such\nan imperfect AI system, we must design for appropriate reliance to prevent over-trusting\nand misuse. For example, when designing the interface, we could consider explainable AI\nmethods to calibrate user trust over time.\n•Design Codebook for LLMs: We constructed our prompts using the codebook for experts.\nAlthough it provides transparency and explicit control, it may limit the model’s performance.\nFuture study is required to understand how to design a more effective codebook for task\nperformance and model understanding.\n•Support Inductive Coding: We demonstrated the feasibility of using LLMs in deductive coding.\nHowever, for inductive coding, where the process is more bottom-up and exploratory, novel\ninteraction and Human-AI collaboration diagrams are required. We should study interaction\ntechniques and controls to let researchers use LLMs more effectively in the qualitative\nanalysis.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Rania Abdelghani, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Edith Law, Catherine de Vulpillieres, and Hélene Sauzéon. 2022.
