Kotb1*, Attia A. El‑Fergany2 & Eid A. Gouda1\nThis paper offers an efficient tool to define the unknown parameters of electrical transformers. The \nproposed methodology is developed based on artificial hummingbird optimizer (AHO) to generate \nthe best values of the transformer’s unknown parameters. At initial stage, the parameters’ extraction \nof the transformer electrical equivalent is adapted as an optimization function along with the \nassociated operating inequality constraints. In which, the sum of absolute errors (SAEs) among many \nvariables from nameplate data of transformers is decided to be minimized. Two test cases of 4 kVA \nand 15 kVA transformers ratings are demonstrated to indicate the ability of the AHO compared to \nother recent challenging optimizers. The proposed AHO achieves the lowest SAE’s value than other \ncompeting algorithms. At advanced stage of this effort, the capture of percentage of loading to \nachieve maximum efficiency is ascertained. At later stage, the performance of transformers utilizing \nthe extracted parameters cropped by the AHO to investigate the principal behavior at energization of \nthese transformer units is made. At the end, it can be confirmed that the AHO produces best values \nof transformer parameters which help much in achieving accurate simulations for steady‑state and \ninrush behaviors.\nThe power transformers are one of the essential and major equipment in power systems. Transformers can \ntransfer energy form generation plants to distribution areas via transmission lines with high efficiency reaches \n99% based on its parameters and the related  losses1. Several research have been introduced to envisage trans-\nformer parameters as to minimize its losses, improve its performance and minimize the operational cost. The \nunknown transformer parameters are nonlinear because of their frequency dependance which makes the trans-\nformer modelling accurateness more  complex2. Transformer parameters estimation became an immense and \nmandatory challenge for optimal transformer design to realize compulsory standards and  specifications3,4. The \ntransformer non- linear performance has been addressed as  in2,5. The determination of transformer unknown \nparameters is affected by the state of its operation; steady or transient  conditions5,6. These parameters can be \nestimated using different methods: the well-known tests; no-load and short circuit  tests7,8, physical sizing of \n transformer9, manufacturer’s  data10, and under various load  information7. Primarily, the analytical methods have \nbeen used for fast evaluation of the transformer physical sizing based on finite element analysis (FEA). Recently, \nnon-conventional exploratory and/or evolutionary calculation algorithms have been  applied11. The evolutionary \nalgorithms have high capability to solve the optimization problems as it can randomly achieve the  objective7. The \noptimization methods have been utilized to extract transformer unknown parameters as well as other electrical \ndevices as electric motors, fuel cells, and storage units in addition to find out the electrical operation parameters \nas optimal load flow and distribution management  systems12–15. The accuracy of the optimization algorithms \nis tested by comparing the extracted parameter values against the actual  ones16–18. A gray box model has been \nproposed to estimate transformer parameters and study its terminals behaviors at frequencies between 20 kHz to \n1 MHz via particle swarm optimization (PSO). This method depends on evaluating the physical dimensions to \ndefine winding inductance, capacitance, and loss  parameters6. The data driven from load testing has been used \nto extract both single and three phase power transformer parameters via  PSO12 and Forensic-Based  algorithm1 \nhas been applied only for single-phase transformer (SPT). Also, slime mold optimizer has been applied to both \nsingle and three phase transformers parameter estimation and compared with other  optimizers19.

The \nno load losses have been included in the objective function (OF) using manta rays foraging optimizer (MRFO) \nand chaotic  MRFO3. Other optimizers have been proposed to evaluate transformer parameters and conducted \npractical tests for confirmation as coyote optimizer for three and single  transformers21, and Jellyfish search opti-\nmizer, gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and machine learning approach for SPT with 4 kV A rating  in10,22,23. \nMulti-objective evolutionary optimization has been adapted to evaluate the transformer parameters, improved \nusing the FEA and verified by comparing the results with the actual measures and  behavior11. Online transformer \nparameters evaluation using practical measurements, different slow frequencies and involving transformer turns \nratio have been applied to get fast results and save the need for high frequency  instruments24. Straightforward \nblack-box algorithm through an optimization method with the help of transfer functions estimated by measured \nvoltage ratios has been introduced to extract distribution transformers parameters at frequency between 1 kHz \nand 1 MHz and in time  domain25.\nExperimental measures of the nonlinear characteristics of inrush current have been used to calculate trans -\nformer parameters with the aid of no-load tests with the help of logic function and load tests via PMU  in26.\nEach one of the metaheuristic optimizers has advantages and some difficulties to solve all the problems. \nAlthough, genetic algorithm (GA) can solve the multifaceted problems, but it has some drawbacks as it has early \nconvergence, and its precision depends on many selected  terms27. PSO overcomes the slow convergence, but it \nhas the obstacle of local optima for large scale problems and comparatively affects its control  parameters28. Ant \ncolony optimizer succeeded in solving dynamic problems, but it has long time for convergence and complicated \n investigations29,30. Artificial bee colony succeeded in making stability between exploration and exploitation but \nfailed in solving the early convergence problem in last iterations and sometimes  inaccuracy31. Cuckoo search \nintroduced a better performance than PSO and GA for the sophisticated optimization  problems32 but it has \nunsatisfactory convergence and local search  capability33,34.\nThe main goal of this work is to accurately identify the optimum SPT unknown parameters via new prom -\nising metaheuristic optimizer and to study its performance at steady state and inrush conditions. Artificial \nhummingbird optimizer (AHO) 35 has been adapted to represent and investigate the SPT. The AHO simulates \nhummingbirds’ skills and behaviour in looking for its food. It exceeds other meta-heuristic optimizers in reach-\ning objectives with higher precision using lesser control parameters. It has a unique property in its specific \nenvironmentalism  experience35. Zhaoa and el al. have successfully assessed the AHO by applying three tests: \nfifty mathematical functions with complex characteristics, the IEEE CEC 2014 benchmark functions and ten \nengineering design problems which proofed the effectiveness of the  algorithm35.\nIn this work, the AHO is applied to 15  kV A7 and 4  kV A1 SPTs, its performance has been studied and compared \nwith other recognized optimizers and works. For more confirmation, the 4 kV A transformer has been simulated \nusing MATLAB/Simulink, comprehensive study has been conducted at steady state and inrush conditions and \ncompared with the calculated well-known behaviour. Also, Interior search algorithm (ISA) has been utilized \nto investigate the same two cases and held an extensive comparison between the proposed AHO optimizer and \nother well-known optimizers. The results prove AHO accurateness and its superiority between other optimizers.\nThe paper contains seven parts: Part 1 declares the Introduction, In Part 2, the SPT mathematical model is \nintroduced. The transformer optimization problem is expressed and adapted in Part 3. In part 4, the AHO pro-\ncedures are expressed and summarized. The application and assessment of the proposed algorithm to represent \nSPT and extract its unknown parameters is tested in Part 5. Also, the performance of the proposed algorithm at \nsteady state and at the inrush condition is examined in Part 6. Finally, the remarkable outcomes and conclusions \nof this search are highlighted in Part 7.\nMathematical modeling of single‑phase transformer and statement\nThe equivalent circuit of SPT refereed to the primary side is shown in Fig. 1.

This bird feeds on mosquitoes, weevils, and aphids. It could shatter its wings \nwith high frequency reaches 80 times/second to follow and hunt its prey. So, the hummingbird is in bad need \nof plentiful energy that is provided by sucking large amounts of flower syrup and sweetened fluid inside plants. \nThe hummingbird movement, behaviour, skills, and memorization capability have been studied and followed to \nrepresent the suggested optimizer. The hummingbird activities can be categorized as three ways for food search-\ning, retention of food resources task and the bird flying forms. A certain number has been proposed for each \nfood resource with a specific plant category. The syrup re-suction rate from the food resource is signified by the \nvalue of the OF . The higher fitness value, the higher the syrup re-suction rate and vice versa. Each hummingbird \nis allocated to a certain location with defined food resource. The location, syrup and sweetened fluid re-suction \nrate are saved in bird mind and shared with the remaining birds within the population. Also, the location of the \nunused food resources by the bird can be defined by itself and shared with the others in the population. Each \nfood resource utilization and the last time it was used for a specific bird are registered in a lookup table is initiated \nand updated. The highest utilization of the food resources is taken as indicator to the better resources to be used \n(16)\n/afii9838\n(\ntj\n)\n= /afii9838\n(\ntj−1\n)\n− V m\nω ×\n[\ncos\n(\nωtj + θ\n)\n− cos\n(\nωtj−1 + θ\n)]\n+ R11 i\n(\ntj−1\n)\n.σ\n+ R11 V m\nL11\n√\nρ2 + ω2 ×\n{\ncos\n(\nωtj + θ − ϕ\n)\nω − cos\n(\nωtj−1 + θ − ϕ\n)\nω − sin\n(\nωtj−1 + θ − ϕ\n)\n.σ\n}\n− R11 γ h\n(\ntj−1\n)\nρ [�τ + σ] − L11\n[\ni\n(\ntj\n)\n− i\n(\ntj−1\n)]\nσ =\n(e−ρ�τ − 1\nρ\n)\n(17)Fobj = minimize (|I11 − I11act| + |I21 − I21act| + |V 21 − V 21act| + |η − ηact|)\n(18)\n\n\n\nR11−min ≤ R11(�) ≤ R11−max\nR21−min ≤ R21(�) ≤ R21−max\nX11−min ≤ X11(�) ≤ X11−max\nX21−min ≤ X21(�) ≤ X21−max\nRm 1−min ≤ Rm 1(�) ≤ Rm 1−max\nXm 1−min ≤ Xm 1(�) ≤ Xm 1−max\n\n\n\nDirected  Sea rch\nRe gion al sea rch\nRe loca/g415on search\nFigure 2.

The food supply lookup table can be initialized as indicated in (20 ). Null means the \nhummingbird is fed from its own food supply and zero means the  kth hummingbird is fed from  jth food supply.\nDirected food search. Hummingbird can fly in omnidirectional, diagonal, and axial to look for the food as \nin Fig. 3. The used directions diri for the food source i can be recorded in a matrix and taken as a guide for the \nbirds as represented in (21).\nwhere iǫm  ,   Randi{1, m}   and Rand _trans(p)  produce random integer number from 1 to m and from 1 to k \nrespectively but Ran1 is a random number from 1 to 0.\nSkills of hummingbird leads to reach its food supply goal and nominate the new updated one from the avail-\nable surrounding sources. The directed food search can be represented as in (22) and (23).\nwhere µi(IT + 1) is the updated location of the ith food supply at iteration (IT + 1) , LOC i(IT) is the existing \nlocation of the  ith food supply, and g is the directed factor according to normal distribution ND(0, 1) with the \nmean value zero and the standard deviation one.

Hummingbirds is used \nto transfer to the goal resources with advanced investigations preventing apparent local solutions.\nRegional food search. After sucking the available syrup and food at the existing source, the hummingbird \nstarts to look for other sources in the same surrounding as in (25) and (26).\nwhere h is the regional factor based on the normal distribution ND(0, 1) when the mean value is zero and the \nstandard deviation is one.\nRelocation food search. When the modified location (MLOC) in the presented region became poor with \nthe food resources, the hummingbird begins to transfer to other locations to search for the required food.

For more verifications, the established ISA optimizer is also \napplied to the two cases and the results of both AHO and ISA compared to other published results in addition to \nthe actual transformers parameters values. Five optimizers are used for the comparisons:  PSO16,  GA16, imperialist \ncompetitive algorithm (ICA)10, chaotic optimization approach (COA) 10, and  GSA10 for test case 1. On the other \nhand, comprehensive comparisons among  PSO1, forensic-based investigation (FBI)1,  JS21,  GA17,  ICA10,  GSA10, \nblack-hole optimization (BHO)41, and hurricane optimization algorithm (HOA)42 to the AHO for test case 2.\nTo assure the stabilization of the AHO’s performance, 1000 population members, 1000 iterations and 10 \nindependent trials are used using Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-4710HQ CPU@ 2.5GHZ, and 8 GB RAM PC.\nTest case 1. The proposed AHO is executed and applied to 15 kV A SPT based on the nameplate data: 15 \nkV A, one-phase, 2400 V/240 V , and 50 Hz. The measured transformer currents and voltages at full load are: I11act \n= 6.2 A, I21act = 6.2 A, V 21act = 2383.8 V , and ηact = 99.2%7,10.\nComparisons between the transformer parameters obtained by different algorithms previously published \nresults of ICA, GSA, and COA  in10, and PSO and GA  in16 are arranged in Table 1. The OF represented by (17) \nis applied considering the values referred to the primary side of the transformer using standard Z-circuit and \nshort-circuit tests.\nTable 2 indicates the four terms of the OF resulted from AHO and ISA optimizers against other recognized \noptimizers. It can be concluded that the errors sum is very close to zero where it is in the range between nearly \n6 to 12 for the other optimizers. The results prove the superiority of the proposed AHO-based approach for the \nparameter estimation of a SPT. For more assessment of the of the applied optimizers, the convergence for case 1 is \ndepicted in Fig. 5. The proposed optimizer produces the minimum SAE’s value which equals to 0.033514. on the \nother hand, the ISA optimizer error is equal to 0.0335284 which assures the high-quality outcome of the AHO.\nTest case 2. The capability of the proposed AHO optimizer to evaluate the SPT parameters is also tested \nby applying it to 4 kV A, one-Phase, 250/125 V , 50 Hz and the obtained parameters compared with other docu-\nmented works as shown in Table  3. Also, the nominal load currents, voltage, and efficiency at full load of the \ntest system are estimated and compared with the well-known optimizers as in Table  4.
