INTRODUCTION\nWith grid size and customer demand level increasing,\nthe power transmission equipment operating safely and eco-\nnomically becomes a signiﬁcant issue to electric enterprises.\nAs one of the keys to electrical equipment, a large power\ntransformer plays an important role in a power system, and\nits abnormal operating is one of the most general causes of\npower system blackout accidents. Therefore, the performance\nof transformers which is more than any other components\nis the main factor to inﬂuence the reliability and economy\nof power system [1]. By conservative estimation, there are\nmore than 30,000 transformers (more than 66kV) in China.\nTheir condition and operation lives are mostly depended\non the practical running environment including load rate,\nrunning temperature, family defects, and running time. If in\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Lorenzo Ciani.\ngood conditions they could work unceasingly without any\nmaintenance but if they were in poor conditions without\nproper maintenance they would cause transformer faults or\neven severe electrical accidents. In that case, conducting\ntraditional transformer maintenance (ﬁrst major repair in the\n10th operation year, and then major repairs in every 5 years;\nminor repairs in every one year) will cause ‘‘over repair’’\nor ‘‘lack of repair’’, which will cause large ﬁnancial losses.\nRecently, condition based maintenance decision making is\nan effective method to solve the ‘‘over repair’’ and ‘‘lack of\nrepair’’ problems. However, only considering the condition\nof a transformer may result in selecting a transformer main-\ntenance strategy without optimizing the cost impact, which\nwill cause ﬁnancial losses. Considering the reliability and\neconomy operation of transformers, effective maintenance\nselection can save 25%-30% of the total transformer life\ncycle cost based on a survey conducted by the Electric Power\nResearch Institute. Therefore, considering both the reliability\n28778\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Donget al.: Novel Maintenance Decision Making Model of Power Transformers\nand economy assessment of a transformer, it is a critical issue\nfor electrical enterprises to select a transformer maintenance\nprogram [2].\nIn recent years, it mainly focused on the reliability\nbased maintenance for the transformer maintenance strategy\nresearches, whose pivotal content is fault diagnosis and con-\ndition assessment of transformers. For the fault diagnosis of\ntransformers, some methods were reported to assess the insu-\nlation condition of a transformer, such as insulation dielectric\nspectrum analysis [3], [4], partial discharge method [5]–[8],\nand dissolve gas analyses [9]–[12]. However, the effective-\nness of dielectric spectrum analysis and partial discharge\nmethod had not been largely demonstrated in practical trans-\nformers; besides, dissolved gas analyses (DGA) was a help-\nful and practical method to assess transformer condition in\nthe past few years. Some DGA related methods, including\ngenetic programming [9] and support vector machine [10],\nwere applied to diagnose the faults of transformers and\nassess the condition of the transformers. Furthermore, some\nmethods, including PSO-least squares support vector [11],\nLSSVM [12], were used to forecast faults of power trans-\nformers based on DGA and assess the future condition of the\ntransformers. However, the accomplishments of these DGA\nmethods are often limited in their failure classiﬁcations of the\nfault condition. In fact, the condition of power transformers\nis often somewhere between normal condition and failure\ncondition [13], [14].\nTherefore, for condition assessment of transformers, trans-\nformer condition is usually depended on main body condition\n(determined by DGA, electrical tests, and oil tests), bush-\ning condition, and accessories condition. The aging mech-\nanism of inner transformer is complex, and some attention\nvalues of indexes are ambiguous and hard to be deﬁned.\nThus, it is hard to obtain the accurate result when assessing\nthe transformer condition. To handle these problems, refer-\nence [13]–[15], and [16] proposed a method of condition\nassessment for transformers using fuzzy theory, evidential\nreasoning approach, and fuzzy evidential reasoning model.\nSome researchers Krishnavel et al.[17] reported an excellent\nwork on the well-being analysis of generator step-up (GSU)\ntransformer insulation which offers a novel thinking for trans-\nformer condition assessment.\nThe above researches only consider the condition of a\ntransformer without considering the overall operation eco-\nnomics. The drawback of the condition based maintenance\nis that it may result in selecting a transformer maintenance\nstrategy which does not optimize the cost impact [18].\nOn the other hand, some models only consider the overall\neconomics of the transformer that was proposed, including\nasset management techniques for transformers [19], life cycle\ncost model of power transformers under the new environ-\nment [20], and small power transformer selection and spec-\niﬁcation [21]. However, research on maintenance decision\nmaking for power transformers by considering both reliability\nand economy synthetically is scarce. It is because the impact\nfactors of maintenance decision making, including reliability\ncondition assessment, fault rate charges after different main-\ntenance types, fault risk evaluation, and optimal maintenance\nselection, are complex and hard to be measured.\nTherefore, an ideal maintenance strategy was proposed\nto address the problem, which was based on the combined\nconsiderations of operational reliability, failure risk and asso-\nciated cost impact. A reliability assessing model of transform-\ners and the impact mechanism of the reliability model under\ndifferent maintenance types were studied in Section II. The\nmaintenance strategy decision making model based on the\noperation risk evaluation and optimal function was developed\nin Sections III. The proposed method was suitable to decide\nthe maintenance strategy of transformers in Sections IV. The\nconclusions are given in Section V.\nII. OPERATION RELIABILITY MODEL\nOF OIL-FILLED TRANSFORMER\nIn general, the transformer operation reliability (negatively\ncorrelated with fault rate) has a huge inﬂuence on mainte-\nnance decision making, and the fault rate of a transformer\nis usually inﬂuenced by some factors including insulation\nhealth, operation environment, maintenance records, and dif-\nferent maintenance actions. Therefore, indices were selected\nin section II.A for calculating the insulation health. The\noperation environment and maintenance records were chosen\nto be corrected parameters for calculating the comprehen-\nsive health index in section II.B. The relationship between\nthe comprehensive health index and fault rate was built in\nsection II.C to obtain the fault rate model. The inﬂuence of\nthe maintenance actions towards the fault rate was studied to\nobtain the maintenance impact mechanism in section II.D.\nA. INDICES SELECTION OF INSULATION ASSESSMENT\nIndices selection is necessary for insulation health assess-\nment. Some indices which are easily measured and have\nan important impact on transformer insulation condition are\nselected to form the insulation assessing index system accord-\ning to relevant standards [22]–[25].\nThe assessing index system of transformer insulation con-\ndition is shown in Figure 1. Different indices offer somewhat\ndifferent pictures of transformer insulation condition, there-\nfore how to determine the weights of assessing indices is\nextremely important. The improved AHP method (an effec-\ntive method to weights decision) was applied to determine\nthe weights of the assessing index system. In Fig. 1, after\nusing the improved AHP method, the weights of the DGA,\noil test, and electrical test are 0.3974, 0.2361, and 0.3665,\nrespectively.\nThe weights of the subset of the DGA, oil test, and elec-\ntrical test are {0.3581, 0.1154, 0.2362, 0.1749, 0.1154},\n{0.1964, 0.1964, 0.1710, 0.4362} and {0.2305, 0.1402,\n0.1402, 0.3041, 0.1850}, respectively.\nB. ASSESSING INDEX SYSTEM OF THE\nCORRECTED PARAMETERS\nThe comprehensive health condition of a transformer is not\nonly related to the insulation condition of the transformer\nVOLUME 7, 2019 28779\nM. Donget al.: Novel Maintenance Decision Making Model of Power Transformers\nFIGURE 1. Assessing index system of transformer insulation condition.\nbut also related to its operation environment condition and\nmaintenance records. The operation environment condition\ncontains indices including operation years, average life-\ntime, operation environment, and load rate. The maintenance\nrecords include indices including family defects, short cir-\ncuit of near zone, cooling system condition, defect records,\nfault records, and partial discharge. These indices depict or\ninfer an impact on the aging rate of transformer insulation.\nTherefore, the indices were used to establish the corrected\nparameter of the operation environment condition a1 and the\ncorrected parameter of maintenance records a2. The relation-\nships between the indices and the corrected parameters are\nbuilt by expert experience and shown in Table 1, and assessing\nindex system of the corrected parameters is shown in Fig. 2.\nIf any of the indices is missed, the corrected parameter of the\nindex is set to 1 in the paper.\nC. FAULT RATE CALCULATION OF TRANSFORMERS\nThe comprehensive health index of a transformer is not only\nrelated to the insulation condition of the transformer but also\nrelated to the condition corrected parameters. The compre-\nhensive health index is calculated by (1) and (2).\na1 =\n4∏\nn=1\nX1na2 =\n6∏\nn=1\nX2n (1)\nTH =HI ×a1 ×a2 (2)\nTABLE 1.

HI is the insulation health index\nof the transformer; a1 and a2 are the corrected factors of\noperation environment condition and maintenance records,\nrespectively.\nIn order to establish a model considering health index, fault\nrate, and practical operation years synthetically, a calculation\nequation of the comprehensive health index was applied and\nshown in (3). This equation has been widely used in condition\n28780 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM. Donget al.: Novel Maintenance Decision Making Model of Power Transformers\nassessment of electrical equipment [26].\nTH =TH0 ×eB×(T2−T1) (3)\nwhere TH is the comprehensive health index; TH0 is the initial\nvalue of the comprehensive health index, and it was set to\nbe 5 in the paper; B is the aging parameter; T1 is the ﬁrst\noperation year; T2 is the current operation year.\nIf the initial value and life end value of the comprehensive\nhealth index can be obtained, the aging parameter B can be\ncalculated by (4) and (5). Assuming that the initial value\nof the comprehensive health index is set to be 5; Texp is the\nexpected lifetime of the transformer. It is expected that, after\nTexp years operation, the fault rate of the transformer will rise\nrapidly and the health index will increase to 100. Texp can\nbe obtained by the relationship among the design lifetime,\nthe corrected factors of operation environment condition, and\nmaintenance records. The relationship among them is shown\nin (4).\nTexp = Tdes\na11 ×a21\n(4)\nwhere Texp is the expected lifetime of the transformer; Tdes is\nthe design lifetime of the transformer. ( Tdes =40 in this study\nbased on the service life of the actual transformers in China’s\npower companies; a11 and a21 are the corrected factors of\naverage lifetime and family defect, respectively.)\nTherefore, the aging parameter B can be calculated by (5):\nB =lnTHend −lnTH0\nTexp\n(5)\nAfter obtaining the value of the aging parameter B, the pre-\ndicted health index of the transformer can be calculated\napproximately by (6). Considering the inﬂuence of mainte-\nnance types, the equation of (3) can be revised to (6).\nTH =TH0 ×eB×1T ′\n(6)\nwhere 1T ′is the equivalent service age of the transformer.\nFuzzy theory is an easy and effective method for solving\nthe insulation condition assessment problem [16]. Therefore,\nwith the assessing index system and weights information\nin section II.A, fuzzy theory was applied to calculate the\ninsulation health index of the transformer. The calculating\nsteps are show as follows:\n1. Normalize the index value, obtain the membership matrix\nof the indices according to the fuzzy membership function.\n2. Using the weights information and membership function\ninformation, apply the fuzzy evaluation matrix to calculate\nthe evaluation matrixes of the three factor layers.\n3. Use these evaluation matrices to conduct fuzzy calculation\nto obtain an evaluation matrix of the insulation condition.\n4. Establish the relationship between the evaluation matrix\nand the insulation health index of the transformer. Trans-\nform the information of the evaluation matrix to a health\nindex value between 0-100 according to (7).\nHI =mr (H1)×0 +mr (H2)×25 +mr (H3)×50\n+mr (H4)×75 +mr (H5)×100 (7)\nwhere HI is the insulation health index; its range is within\n[0, 100]; 0 refers to the insulation condition of the trans-\nformer is very good, while 100 refers to the insulation\ncondition is extremely severe. mr is the ﬁnal evaluation\nmatrix;mr (Hn) is the possibility that the evaluation matrix\nsupports the nth grade.\n5. According to the historical records and Table 1, the cor-\nrected factors of the comprehensive health condition are\ndetermined by (1).\n6. Calculate the comprehensive health index of the\ntransformer by (2).\n7. Establish the reliability model of the transformer by (8).\nλ=K ×eC×TH (8)\nwhere λis the fault rate of the equipment; K is the pro-\nportional factor; C is the curvature coefﬁcient; TH is the\ncomprehensive health index of the transformer.\nAccording to the data of Table 1 in [27], C and K were\ncalculated by method of inversion in (9) and K = 0.011,\nC = 0.045. The real data sets of TH and fault rate are\nobtained, and set TH =[16.5 25.4 35.2 41.6 53.7], set fault\nrate =[0.03 0.028 0.048 0.084 0.121]. The parameters esti-\nmation coefﬁcients are shown as follows: K =0.011 (95%\nconﬁdence bounds: [0.0073, 0.0147]), C = 0.045 (95%\nconﬁdence bounds: [0.025, 0.065]); SSE (the sum of squares\ndue to error): 0.0002756, R-square (coefﬁcient of deter-\nmination): 0.9565, Adjusted R-square (degree-of-freedom\nadjusted coefﬁcient of determination): 0.942, RMSE (root\nmean squared error): 0.009585.\nλ=l\nL ×100% =\n10∑\nn=1\nLn×K ×eC×THn ×100% (9)\nwhere λis the fault rate of the equipment; l is the fault amount\nof the transformers; L is the total amount of the transformers,\nn =1,2,..., 10;Ln is the amount number of the nth grade\ntransformer; THn is the average value of the bound value of\nthe nth grade.\nIII. MAINTENANCE STRATEGY SELECTION\nBASED ON RELIABILITY AND COST\nANALYSIS OF TRANSFORMERS\nA. OPERATION RISK EVALUATION MODEL\nOF TRANSFORMERS\nOperation risk evaluation model of a transformer is usually\nrelated to ﬁnancial losses. Financial losses of transformer\nfailures not only include the repair or replacement cost of\nthe transformer, but also contain the costs caused by the\nfailure including environmental risk, injury risk, and service\ndisruption risk. The operation risk of a transformer can be\ncalculated by (10).\nRisk =POTF ×LOTF (10)\nwhere Risk is the risk value of a transformer (unit: RMB);\nPOTF is the probability of fault occurrence (fault rate λ),\nwhich is determined by II.C; LOTF is the ﬁnancial loss of the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 28781\nM.

Ci(i =1,2,3) refers to the repair\ncosts of the transformer in different fault types. Under C1 con-\ndition (normal fault), the fault repair costs of 110kV, 220kV,\nand 500kV transformers are 10,000 RMB, 20,000 RMB,\nand 30,000 RMB, respectively; under C2 condition (seri-\nous fault), the fault repair costs of 110kV, 220kV, and\n500kV transformers are 100,000 RMB, 200,000 RMB, and\n280,000 RMB, respectively; under C3 condition (extremely\nserious fault), the fault repair costs of 110kV, 220kV, and\n500kV transformers are 1,800,000 RMB, 5,000,000 RMB,\nand 8,000,000 RMB, respectively. β2 is the corrected factor\nof the repair cost.

INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE\nTYPES ON FAULT RATE\nThe maintenance recover effect always depends on the exe-\ncuting maintenance types of the transformer. According to\nengineering experience, when the value of the fault rate of a\ntransformer is small, the condition of the transformer is good\nand the recover effect of the maintenance towards the fault\nrate is small. With the aging of the transformer insulation,\nthe fault rate becomes bigger than before, the health condition\nof the transformer becomes worse, and the recover effect of\nthe maintenance towards the fault rate is bigger than that of\nthe small fault rate. If the no maintenance (including routine\npreventive inspection and condition monitoring) is taken,\nthe recover value of fault rate is 0; If the minor repair is\ntaken, the recover value of the fault rate is 0.2 λ; If the major\nrepair is taken, the recover value of the fault rate is 0.5 λ;\nIf the replacement maintenance is taken, the fault rate of the\ntransformer is the same as a new one and λ=λ0.\nAccording to equations (3) to (8), the relationship between\nthe equivalent service age T of the transformer and the fault\nrate λcan be described by (19).\nλ=K ×eC×TH0×eB×T\n(19)\nFIGURE 3. The relationship between the equivalent service age and the\nfault rate.\nThe relationship between the equivalent service age and the\nfault rate is shown in Figure 3. As shown in Fig.3, assuming\nthat t0 is the equivalent service age and λt0 is the fault rate\nof the transformer at the time; tx is the best maintenance\noperation time and λtx is the fault rate at that time; t1 is\nthe equivalent service age after the best maintenance oper-\nation time and λt1 is the fault rate at that time; ta (a =\n0,1,2,3,4 representing no maintenance, minor repair, major\nmaintenance, and replacement, respectively) is the equivalent\nrollback service age and its value is determined by executing\nthe maintenance types. In other words, four maintenance\ntypes extend the transformer equivalent service age ta (a =\n0,1,2,3,4) years.\nWith the different maintenance types, the relationship\nbetween the equivalent service age and the recover value of\nthe fault rate were built and shown in (20).\nRecovera =\n\n\n\n0 a =0\n0.2λ a =1\n0.5λ a =2\nλ−λ0 a =3\n(20)\nAssuming that the relationship between the maintenance\ncosts and the maintenance types are calculated by (21).\n\n\n\nOverhaula110kV =\n\n\n\n0 a =0\nCa1 ×(1 +λ) a =1\nCa2 ×(1 +λ) a =2\nCa3 a =3\nOverhaula220kV =\n\n\n\n0 a =0\nCa1 ×(1 +λ) a =1\nCa2 ×(1 +λ) a =2\nCa3 a =3\nOverhaula500kV =\n\n\n\n0 a =0\nCa1 ×(1 +λ) a =1\nCa2 ×(1 +λ) a =2\nCa3 a =3\n(21)\nwhere Ca1 of the 110kV, 220kV, and 500kV transformers are\n100,000 RMB, 200,000 RMB, and 280,000 RMB, respec-\ntively; Ca2 of the 110kV, 220kV, and 500kV transformers are\n480,000 RMB, 1,000,000 RMB, and 3,600,000 RMB, respec-\ntively (the major repair costs of the 110kV, 220kV, and 500kV\ntransformers are 6% of their purchase cost [31]; Ca3 of the\n110kV, 220kV, and 500kV transformers are 8,000,000 RMB,\n17000000 RMB, and 60,000,000 RMB, respectively.\nC. MAINTENANCE SELECTION MODEL\nOF TRANSFORMERS\nThe aim of the maintenance selection model is to ensure the\nfault rate of the transformer within an acceptable range and\nto obtain the maximum power supply beneﬁt under mini-\nmum maintenance costs. Some regulations are provided for\nselecting the best maintenance strategy including the equal\ncost regulation (the best maintenance strategy is obtaining the\nmaximum beneﬁt under the same cost and the constraint con-\nditions), the equal beneﬁt regulation (the best maintenance\nstrategy is to obtain the minimum cost under the same beneﬁt\nVOLUME 7, 2019 28783\nM. Donget al.: Novel Maintenance Decision Making Model of Power Transformers\nand the constraint conditions), and the cost-to-income ratio\nregulation (the best maintenance strategy is to acquire the\nminimum cost-to-income ratio under the constraint condi-\ntions). The equal beneﬁt regulation is selected in the paper\nbecause it can simplify the maintenance selection model [32].\nThe ﬁrst task of the maintenance selection model is to ana-\nlyze and determine the beneﬁt function and the cost function\nof a transformer. The beneﬁt function and the cost function\ncan be analyzed and built by Figure 3. As shown in Figure 3,\nt0 is the equivalent service age and λt0 is the fault rate of the\ntransformer at the time; tx is the best maintenance operation\ntime and λtx is the fault rate at that time; t1 is the equivalent\nservice age after the best maintenance operation time and λt1\nis the fault rate at that time; ta (a =0,1,2,3,4 representing\nno maintenance, minor repair, major repair, and replacement,\nrespectively) is the equivalent rollback service age and its\nvalue is determined by the maintenance types. In other words,\nfour maintenance types extend the transformer equivalent\nservice age ta (a =0,1,2,3,4) year. Therefore, the reward\nfunction of different maintenance types can be calculated\nby (22).\nRewarda =\n∫ tx\nt1\npowerearnadt −\n∫ tx\nt1\nRiskadt\n−\n∫ tx\nt1\npowerlossadt −overhaul cos ta\n=\n∫ tx\nt1\n(\nSN ×cos ϕ×l ×b1 ×c11 ×tyear ×d11\n)\ndt\n−\n∫ tx\nt1\n(λa ×LOTFa)dt\n−\n∫ tx\nt1\n(\nPKl ×tyear +Pk0 ×l ×l ×tτ\n)\ndt\n−overhaulcosta (22)\nThe best maintenance strategy is executing the ath (a =\n0,1,2,3,4 representing no maintenance, minor repair, major\nrepair, and replacement, respectively) at tx time. Considering\nthe fault rate should be in an acceptable range, therefore,\nthe maintenance selection problem was transformed to the\nmaximization problem in (23).\n\n\n\nF =Max (Rewarda)\n=Max\n(∫tx\nt1 powerearnadt −\n∫tx\nt1 Riskadt\n−\n∫tx\nt1 powerlossadt −overhaulcosta\n)\n=Max\n[∫tx\nt1\n(\nSN ×cos ϕ×l×b1 ×c11 ×tyear ×d11\n)\ndt\n−\n∫tx\nt1 (λ×LOTFa)dt\n−\n∫tx\nt1\n(\nPkl ×tyear +Pk0 ×l×l×tτ\n)\ndt −overhaulcosta\n]\nConstraints :0 ≤λ≤λattention;t1 ≤tx\n(23)\nwhere F is the function expression of the maximization prob-\nlem; Rewarda is the reward of the ath maintenance at tx time;∫tx\nt1 powerearnadt is the power supply beneﬁt value of the\ntransformer by executing the ath maintenance from range\nt1 to tx ;\n∫tx\nt1 Riskadt is the operation risk value of the trans-\nformer by executing the ath maintenance from range t1 to tx ;∫tx\nt1 powerlossdt is the power loss value of the transformer,\nmainly considering the active power loss, by executing the\nath maintenance from range t1 to tx ; overhaulcosta is the\nmaintenance cost by executing the ath maintenance; SN is\nthe capacity of the transformer; cosϕ is the average power\nfactor, and cosϕ=0.9 in the paper; l is the transformer load\nrate; c11 is the cost differential between power generating and\npower supply, and c11 =0.2 RMB/MWh in the paper; tyear\nis the hours in a year, and tyear =8760 h/year; d11 is the\ncontribution rate of the transformer in the total power supply\nchain, and d11 =0.5 in the paper; λis the probability of fault\noccurrence, which is determined by 2.3; LOTF is the ﬁnancial\nloss of the transformer after suffering from fault; Pkl is the\nno-load active loss of the transformer; Pk0 is the short circuit\nactive loss of the transformer; tτ is the average maximum load\nloss hours in one year, tτ =5600h in the paper; λattention is\nthe maximum acceptable transformer fault rate of the trans-\nformer, λattention =0.3 in the paper. If Max( Rewarda) is\nobtained, the best maintenance type a and best maintenance\nexecuting time tx can be determined.\nD. MAINTENANCE OPTIMIZATION MODEL BASED ON\nPARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION (PSO)\nPSO shares some similarities with other evolutionary algo-\nrithms (e.g. genetic algorithms), however the classical PSO\ndoes not use evolution operators including crossover and\nmutation. PSO emulates and works on the social behavior of\nparticles in the swarm. During the iterative search in the d-\ndimensional solution space, each particle in the swarm will\nadjust its ﬂying velocity and position according to its own\nﬂying experience as well as those of the others [33]. The\nmajor advantage of PSO is that it uses the physical move-\nments of the individuals in the swarm and has a ﬂexible and\nwell-balanced mechanism to enhance and adapt to the global\nand local exploration abilities. Another advantage of PSO is\nits simplicity in coding and consistency in performance. So in\nthis study we use the PSO to optimize the model.\nIn each iteration, the velocity vd\ni (t) and position pd\ni (t) of\nparticles are updated by the following equations\n\n\n\nvd\ni (t +1) =vd\ni (t) +c1r(t)\n(\npd\ni (t) −xd\ni (t)\n)\n+c2r(t)\n(\npd\ng (t) −xd\ni (t)\n)\nxd\ni (t +1) =xd\ni (t) +vd\ni (t)\n(24)\nwhere c1 and c2 are two acceleration constants. r(t) is a\nrandom variable that is drawn from an uniform distribution\nin the open interval (0, 1). The velocity vd\ni (t) is restricted\nto the [– vmax , vmax ] range in which vmax is a predeﬁned\nboundary value. pd\ni (t) is the best solution that particle i has\nobtained until iteration t, and pd\ng (t) represents the best solu-\ntion obtained among all particles in the swarm thus far.\nAs PSO has strong global optimization ability, it has\nbeen applied to select the best maintenance method and\n28784 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM.

Using the results of fuzzy membership degrees in\nTable 4 and the weights information in II.A, the calculation\nmethod of fuzzy matrix was applied and the health judg-\nment matrix of the transformer was obtained and E =\n{0.2489,0.6574,0.0937,0,0}. The matrix was transformed to\nhealth index by (7), and the comprehensive health index of the\ntransformer was obtained (the health index of the transformer\nis 21.12).\nStep 2: according to other related information, the other\ncorrected factors were equal to 1, except a11 =1.02, a13 =\n1.02, a14 =0.9694.

Based on\n(10) - (12) and Figure 3, inﬂuence of different maintenance\ntypes on fault rate can be obtained. According to (15) - (21),\nloss1=1.744×105 RMB, loss2=2.250×105 RMB, loss3=\n1.000×104 RMB, loss4=4.592×104 RMB. Based on (14),\nthe ﬁnancial loss after the failure of the transformer was\nLOTF=2.0254×106 RMB.\nStep 5: use the results of step 4 to determine the unknown\nparameters of the equation (23) in section III.D.\nStep 6: Based on (10) - (12) and (22) - (23), accord-\ning to the ﬂowchart of maintenance optimization (Figure 4)\nin III.C, the optimization results under different maintenance\ntypes were established in Fig.6. As shown in Figure 6, four\nsubgraphs were named optimization results under no main-\ntenance, optimization results under minor repair, optimiza-\ntion results under major repair, optimization results under\nreplacement and represented by Figure 6 (a), Figure 6 (b),\nFigure 6 (c), and Figure 6 (d), respectively. As shown in\nFigure 6 (a), horizontal axis (epoch) represents the particle\nevolution generation of PSO; vertical coordinates represent\nthe optimal value of function F; for partial dynamics, dimen-\nsion 1 represents the maintenance type of a transformer;\ndimension 2 represents the optimal TH value under this main-\ntenance type; Some parameters of PSO model were set in\nsection III.D and displayed in Figure 6 (a). Figure 6 (b),\nFigure 6 (c), and Figure 6 (d) shows the similar information as\nFigure 6 (a). The maximum value of the function F under dif-\nferent maintenance types (including no maintenance, minor\nrepair, major repair, and replacement) were 2.5273 ×108,\n2.0759×108, 5.1786 ×108 and 5.0681 ×108, respectively.\nThe best maintenance strategy is executing the major repair\nafter 16.4288 years (35.7799 - 19.3511). According to the\nequivalent service age 1T ′=19.3511, the actual operation\ntime was roughly the same as the equivalent service age.\nTherefore, it can be deduced that the transformer is aging\nin the normal rate. In addition, the health index of the trans-\nformer was 21.30, which represents the transformer was still\nin a normal condition. Only routine preventive inspection\nand condition monitoring are recommended to act to the\ntransformer and there was no need to arrange maintenance for\nthe near term. Therefore, to get the maximum beneﬁt, major\nrepair will be taken after 16.4288 years is reasonable.\n28786 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM.

As shown in Figure 7, four subgraphs\nwere named optimization results under no maintenance, opti-\nmization results under minor repair, optimization results\nunder major repair, optimization results under replacement\nand represented by Figure 7 (a), Figure 7 (b), Figure 7 (c),\nand Figure 7 (d), respectively. As shown in Figure 7 (a),\nhorizontal axis (epoch) represents the particle evolution gen-\neration of PSO; vertical coordinates represent the optimal\nvalue of function F; for partial dynamics, dimension 1 rep-\nresents the maintenance type of a transformer; dimension 2\nrepresents the optimal TH value under this maintenance type;\nSome parameters of PSO model were set in section III.D\nand displayed in Figure 7 (a). Figure 7 (b), Figure 7 (c), and\nFigure 7 (d) shows the similar information as Figure 7 (a).\nThe maximum value of the function F under different main-\ntenance types (including no maintenance, minor repair, major\nrepair, and replacement) were 5.1848 ×107, 7.7528 ×107,\n1.3894×108 and 8.1020 ×108, respectively. The best mainte-\nnance strategy is executing the replacement after 2.1523 years\n(34.4037 - 32.2514). According to the equivalent service\nage 1T ′ = 32.2514, the actual operation time was much\nsmaller than the equivalent service age [36].Therefore, it can\nbe deduced that the transformer was aging in the acceler-\nated rate. In addition, the health index of the transformer\nwas 61.6498, which represents the transformer was still in\na serious condition. Therefore, to get the maximum beneﬁt,\nreplacement will be taken after 2.1523 years is reasonable.\nBy applying the condition assessment methods of fuzzy\nevidential and cloud evidential respectively in [16] and [34],\nthe results of the condition assessment the transformer are\nshown in (27) and (28), respectively. The results demonstrate\n28788 VOLUME 7, 2019\nM.

However, as shown in Figure 7, executing replacement\nis more economic than executing major repair, which means\nthe proposed method is an effective method.\nComparing with the other two methods, the results of the\nthree methods for maintenance decision making is replace-\nment after 2.1523 years, however the proposed method pro-\nvide a quantitative maintenance time which is better than the\nother two methods. The actual situation was that, the trans-\nformer was executed major repair after 1 month; however,\nthe loss and the fault rate of the transformer were too high to\nobtain a well beneﬁt [37]. The transformer was recommended\nto replace in the end, which demonstrated that the proposed\nmodel is an effective method to solve maintenance decision\nmaking problem.\nT 1 ={0.00010.00460.03600.94400.00010.0152} (27)\nT 2 ={0.00110.24450.34320.34720.03360.0042} (28)\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nAccording to some relevant standards and expert experience,\nbased on the establishment of an insulation evaluation system,\na maintenance decision making optimization model of power\ntransformers considering both reliability and economy was\nproposed in the paper. The achievements are shown as the\nfollows:\nA reliability evaluation model of power transformers was\nestablished in the paper. DGA tests, oil tests and electri-\ncal tests were selected to assess the insulation condition of\ntransformers. With the insulation condition assessing result,\nthe operation environment and maintenance records were\nchosen to be corrected parameters for calculating the com-\nprehensive health index of transformers. Based on the rela-\ntionship between the comprehensive health index and fault\nrate and the inﬂuence of the maintenance actions towards the\nfault rate, a reliability evaluation model of the transformer\nwas presented in the paper. Reliability assessing results of\ntransformers shows that the reliability evaluation model is an\neffective method because it not only includes the insulation\nof transformers but also considers the operation environment\nand maintenance records of transformers.\nBased on the PSO method, a maintenance optimization\nmethod considering reliability and economy assessment was\nproposed in the paper, which can be used to determine the best\ntime and the best maintenance type for the transformer main-\ntenance. Two cases were studied and the results demonstrated\nthat the proposed model is effective. The proposed model can\noffer a new thinking to transformer maintenance selection.\nHowever, the research of the condition based maintenance\nand maintenance decision making is still in its infant stage.\nIt is hard to collect plentiful practical economic data and\ntest data before and after maintenance actions. Therefore,\nit is hard to get the precise value of some parameters and\nthe practical inﬂuence of different maintenance actions under\ndifferent comprehensive health index values [38]. In addition,\nsome parameters are obtained by some subject experience in\nthe risk evaluation of the transformer. Therefore, the future\nstudy is to improve the precision of the maintenance decision\nmaking model.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nM.D., H.Z. and Y.Z. designed the algorithms and performed\nthe writing.
