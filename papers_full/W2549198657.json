  "abstract": "Accurate distribution secondary circuit models are needed to effectively monitor and coordinate the distributed energy resources located in the secondary circuits and to enhance overall distribution system operations and planning. Accurate secondary models are also needed to fully leverage the measurement data received from smart meters and distributed energy resources at the customer premises. This paper discusses approaches for creating distribution system secondary low-voltage circuit models utilizing smart meter measurements. This paper also discusses methods to model secondary circuits when the loads and distributed energy resources are only partially metered. The presented methods are demonstrated on a real distribution secondary circuit with smart meter measurements and transformer low voltage measurements. Practical challenges related to real measurement data are discussed.",
