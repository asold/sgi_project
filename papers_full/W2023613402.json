  "full_text": "Reading is arguably the most complex cognitive activity \nin which humans routinely engage (Huey, 1908; Rayner & \nPollatsek, 1989). To appreciate its complexity, consider \nwhat transpires in the mind of a reader during just a few \nseconds of reading (see, e.g., Gough, 1972): When the \neyes move to a new location on the printed page, visual \nfeatures from the input are propagated from the eyes to \nportions of the visual system that extract their shapes and \nlocations in order to generate visual representations of \nboth individual letters and words (McCandliss, Cohen, & \nDehaene, 2003). Some small number of these features are \nselected through attention (McConkie & Rayner, 1975; \nRayner, 1975) and then rapidly converted into nonvisual \nrepresentations, including the orthographic and phono-\nlogical codes that correspond to a word’ s spelling and pro-\nnunciation, respectively, and the codes that correspond to \na word’ s meaning and syntactic category (see, e.g., Taft, \n1991). At some point while this is happening, enough in-\nformation will have accrued from the fixation to warrant \nmoving the eyes to a new location. At this point, the oculo-\nmotor system uses the information about word boundar-\nies available in peripheral vision to begin programming a \nsaccade to move the eyes to another location. While this \nsaccade is being programmed, the lexical information that \nhas become available will be integrated with whatever \nsyntactic and/or semantic information had been extracted \nfrom previously identified words to build a representation \nof the sentence (Frazier, 1998) and of whatever situation \nis being described by the larger text (Kintsch, 1988). And \nfinally, while this integration is being completed, the sys-\ntems involved in visual and lexical processing are directed \ntoward the next unidentified word, causing both the eyes \nand attention to move down the line of text.\nOf course, this description of the cognitive processes \nthat occur during a short interval of reading is a gross \noversimplification. For example, it says nothing about \nthe functional characteristics of the individual processes \n(e.g., how long they take to complete, etc.), nor about the \nrepresentations they operate on. It also ignores the fact \nthat many of these processes are themselves dependent \non even more basic or domain-general cognitive systems \n(e.g., working memory; Baddeley, 1986). Also, this de-\nscription suggests that the cognitive processes involved \nin reading are executed in a strictly bottom-up manner, \nwith the construction of the textual representation being \nentirely driven by the inflow of visual and lexical informa-\ntion. Evidence instead suggests that many of the cognitive \nprocesses involved in reading are highly interactive; for \nexample, highly predictable words (e.g., function words) \nare often identified more rapidly than less predictable \nwords because they are constrained by their semantic and/\nor syntactic contexts (Balota, Pollatsek, & Rayner, 1985; \nEhrlich & Rayner, 1981; Rayner, Ashby, Pollatsek, &  \n Reichle, 2004; Rayner & Well, 1996). Finally, this descrip-\ntion of what transpires in the mind of a reader also ignores \nthe fact that the automatic coordination of so many in-\nterrelated processes is a skill usually acquired only after \nformal training and much practice.\n 1 © 2009 The Psychonomic Society, Inc.\nTHEORETICAL AND REVIEW ARTICLES\nUsing E-Z Reader to model the effects of  \nhigher level language processing on  \neye movements during reading\nERIK D. REICHLE, TESSA WARREN, AND KERRY MCCONNELL\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAlthough computational models of eye-movement control during reading have been used to explain how sac-\ncadic programming, visual constraints, attention allocation, and lexical processing jointly affect eye movements \nduring reading, these models have largely ignored the issue of how higher level, postlexical language processing \naffects eye movements. The present article shows how one of these models, E-Z Reader (Pollatsek, Reichle, & \nRayner, 2006c), can be augmented to redress this limitation. Simulations show that with a few simple assump-\ntions, the model can account for the fact that effects of higher level language processing are not observed on eye \nmovements when such processing is occurring without difficulty, but can capture the patterns of eye movements \nthat are observed when such processing is slowed or disrupted.\nPsychonomic Bulletin & Review\n2009, 16 (1), 1-21\ndoi:10.3758/PBR.16.1.1\nE. D. Reichle, reichle@pitt.edu\n2     R EICHLE, WARREN, AND MCCONNELL\n(e.g., just as one current model has been used to test the \nadequacy of various accounts of lexical ambiguity reso-\nlution; Reichle, Pollatsek, & Rayner, 2007). Similarly, \nsuch models will be extremely useful for generating novel \npredictions that can then be tested by new empirical re-\nsearch (see, e.g., Pollatsek, Juhasz, Reichle, Machacek, \n& Rayner, 2008).\nThe second cost is more directly related to the models \nthemselves: Until now, most of the debate about which \nof the models more accurately describes the processes \nthat guide readers’ eye movements has focused on very \nlow-level phenomena, such as the degree to which the \nmodels successfully explain fixation landing-site distri-\nbutions (see Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 1999; Reilly \n& O’Regan, 1998). Although such phenomena are impor-\ntant, the models have not been evaluated on their potential \ncapacity (or lack thereof) to explain the many phenomena \nrelated to higher level language processing that have also \nbeen well documented in the literature and that are also \nimportant for our understanding of reading (for a review, \nsee Clifton, Staub, & Rayner, 2007). Higher level lan-\nguage processing provides a second basis for comparing \nmodels of eye-movement control—one that may be more \ndiagnostic for evaluating the theoretical adequacy of ex-\nisting and future models.\nFor these reasons, we believe that it is time to attempt \nto model how higher level language processing influences \nthe patterns of eye movements that are observed during \nreading. The remainder of this article will describe our \nattempt to do this. We use the most recent version of the \nE-Z Reader model of eye-movement control in reading \n(Pollatsek, Reichle, & Rayner, 2006c; Reichle, Pollatsek, \n& Rayner, 2006) as a framework for embedding our as-\nsumptions about how higher level language processing \ninteracts with the other systems known to affect readers’ \neye movements. The version of the E-Z Reader model that \nwill be described in this article (E-Z Reader 10) provides a \npreliminary account of how the time course of postlexical \nlanguage processing and its completion influence atten-\ntion and lexical processing, and thereby affect eye move-\nments during reading. Before introducing this version of \nthe model and showing how it describes such effects, how-\never, we will first provide a brief overview of the model’ s \nimmediate predecessor, E-Z Reader 9. (For a complete \ndescription of E-Z Reader 9, see Pollatsek et al., 2006c; \nReichle et al., 2006.)\nE-Z READER\nFigure 1A is a schematic diagram of E-Z Reader 9. \nAs the figure shows, the model describes how a preat-\ntentive stage of visual processing, the allocation of at-\ntention, word identification, and the operating character-\nistics of the oculomotor system affect when and where \nreaders move their eyes during reading. The figure also \nillustrates the two core assumptions of the model: (1) that \nthe completion of an early stage of lexical processing on \nword n, called the familiarity check, or L\n1, is the “trigger” \nthat causes the oculomotor system to begin programming \nOver the past 100 years, a considerable amount has \nbeen learned about what happens in the minds of read-\ners, much of it by studying eye movements (Rayner, 1978, \n1998; Rayner & Pollatsek, 1989). Because printed text—in \ncontrast to spoken language—is arranged along a spatial \ndimension (e.g., in English, lines of text proceed from left \nto right and from top to bottom), one can make inferences \nabout the cognitive processes that occur during reading, \nby measuring when and where readers move their eyes \n(Rayner, 1979). The logic of this method is predicated on \nthe simple assumption that where a reader is looking at \nany point in time reflects, at least to some degree, what-\never is going on in his or her mind at that time (Just & \nCarpenter, 1980). Although a strong version of this as-\nsumption is incorrect (e.g., readers often partially process \nupcoming words before they are actually fixated; Balota \net al., 1985; Rayner, 1975), a weaker form is a reason-\nable approximation, as evidenced by the fact that a large \nvariety of visual and linguistic variables have been shown \nto influence readers’ eye movements (for a review, see \nRayner, 1998).\nIn fact, eye-movement experiments have taught us so \nmuch about the cognitive processes involved in read-\ning that the last decade has witnessed the development \nof a number of new computational models of readers’ \neye movements (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, \n2005; Feng, 2006; McDonald, Carpenter, & Shillcock, \n2005; Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998; Reilly \n& Radach, 2006; Y ang, 2006; for an overview of several \nof these models, see the 2006 special issue of Cognitive \nSystems Research). These models were developed to de-\nscribe and explain how primary constraints related to \nsaccadic programming (e.g., saccadic error), visual pro-\ncessing (e.g., limited retinal acuity), attention allocation \n(e.g., whether attention is allocated to one or more than \none word at a time), and the identification of words affect \nwhere and how long readers direct their gaze during read-\ning. Although these models often make different assump-\ntions about how these various constraints determine the \nmoment-to-moment movement of a reader’ s eyes, each is \nable to reproduce a significant number of eye-movement \nbehaviors observed during reading and to describe how \nthese behaviors are influenced by various oculomotor, \nvisual, and/or lexical constraints. These models share a \ncommon limitation, however, in that they have said very \nlittle or nothing about how higher level language process-\ning influences readers’ eye movements.\nAlthough we acknowledge that the strategy of building \nmodels that explain only the effects of low-level processes \n(e.g., word identification) but that ignore higher level, \npostlexical influences has been successful in advancing \nthe field, we believe that this strategy has incurred at least \ntwo hidden costs. The first is that by focusing exclusively \non low-level variables, experimenters have failed to use \nthese models to their full potential. For example, models \nthat more accurately describe how all aspects of language \nprocessing affect eye movements would hold tremendous \npotential as analytical frameworks for evaluating exist-\ning theoretical assumptions about language processing \nUSING E-Z READER TO MODEL LANGUAGE PROCESSING EFFECTS    3\nduring this stage of processing (e.g., the blank spaces that \ndemarcate individual words) is used by the oculomotor \nsystem to select saccade targets. A small subset of the \nhigh-spatial-frequency information (e.g., the features that \nare necessary for identifying individual letters) is also se-\nlected via attention to be used by the word-identification \nsystem for further lexical processing.\nAs already mentioned, the first stage of lexical process-\ning in the model is L\n1, the familiarity check. The duration \nof L1 on word n during any given Monte Carlo simula-\ntion run, t(L1), is determined by sampling a random devi-\nate from a gamma distribution with a mean specified by \nEquation 1, below (SD \u0015 0.22 L\n1). As Equation 1 shows, \nthe duration of L1 is a function of the natural logarithm of \nword n’ s frequency of occurrence in printed text, as esti-\nmated by using the norms of Francis and Ku kera (1982), \nand its local, within-sentence predictability, as estimated \nby using cloze-task norms (i.e., the proportion of subjects \nwho, when given all of the words up through word n\u00121, \nare able to correctly guess the identity of word n).\n1 Note \nthat in the model, word n can sometimes (with a prob-\nability, p, equal to the word’ s predictability) be “guessed” \nfrom its preceding sentence context. When this happens, \nthe duration of L\n1 for word n is set equal to 0 msec (see \nthe upper branch of Equation 1). This assumption is con-\nsistent with observations that in eye-movement experi-\nments where only the fixated word is displayed (i.e., all \nof the other words are replaced by Xs), readers sometimes \ndo not fixate short, highly predictable words, such as the \nword the (Rayner, Well, Pollatsek, & Bertera, 1982). How-\never, for most words, the duration of L\n1 (in milliseconds) \nis determined by the lower branch of Equation 1, where \n(\n1 (122), (2 (4), and (3 (10) are free parameters that de-\ntermine the rate of lexical processing. Words that are more \ncommon (frequent) are therefore processed more rapidly \nand are the recipients of fewer and/or shorter fixations \nthan are less common words; this is consistent with empir-\nical results (Inhoff & Rayner, 1986; Rayner, 1977; Rayner \n& Duffy, 1986; Schilling, Rayner, & Chumbley, 1998). \nSimilarly, words that are predictable from their sentence \ncontext are processed more rapidly and are the recipients \nof fewer and/or shorter fixations than are less predictable \nwords, which is also consistent with empirical results (Ba-\nlota et al., 1985; Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Rayner et al., \n2004; Rayner & Well, 1996).\nAnother important constraint in the model is related \nto limited visual acuity: Words that are farther from the \ncenter of vision (i.e., from the fovea) and/or are longer \nrequire more time to process than do words near the fovea \nand/or shorter words (Rayner & Morrison, 1981), because \nthe high-resolution vision that is necessary to perceive the \nfine details that comprise letters and words decreases rap-\nidly from the fovea to peripheral vision. The relationship \nbetween word n’ s length, the duration of L\n1, and visual \nacuity is thus specified by Equation 2, where t(L1) is the \nduration of t(L1), as modulated by visual acuity. In Equa-\na saccade to move the eyes from word n to word n\u00111; \nand (2) that the subsequent completion of a second stage \nof lexical processing on word n, called the completion of \nlexical access, or L\n2, causes attention to shift from word n \nto word n\u00111. Thus, the programming of saccades is de-\ncoupled from the shifting of attention, which is allocated \nserially to only a single word at a time.\nAccording to the assumptions of the model, there is \nan early, preattentive stage of visual processing (labeled \n“V” in Figure 1), during which the visual features on the \nprinted page are propagated from the retina to the brain. \nThe time that is needed to do this in the model, t(V), is \nassumed to equal 50 msec. This time reflects recent physi-\nological research showing that the eye-to-brain lag is ap-\nproximately 50 msec (Clark, Fan, & Hillyard, 1995; Foxe \n& Simpson, 2002; Mouchetant-Rostaing, Giard, Bentin, \nAguera, & Pernier, 2000; VanRullen & Thorpe, 2001).

The length of this delay, t(R), is sampled from a \ngamma distribution with a mean of R \u0015 117 msec (SD \u0015 \n0.22 R). Equation 7 specifies how the probability of mak-\ning a refixation increases as a function of saccadic error, \nwith one free parameter,  (0.09), modulating the strength \nof this relationship.\nProb. refixation \u0015\u0000\n |center of word \u0012 initial fixation location| \u0000 (7)\nThese assumptions about saccade programming and \nexecution are sufficient for the model to account for the \nfinding that fixation landing-site distributions resemble \ntruncated normal distributions (with the missing tails re-\nflecting saccades that undershot or overshot their intended \ntargets) that are centered on words and that become more \nvariable with saccade length (McConkie, Kerr, Reddix, \n& Zola, 1988; McConkie et al., 1991; O’Regan, 1981; \nO’Regan & Lévy-Schoen, 1987). The model also ac-\ncounts for the finding that refixations are more likely fol-\nlowing initial fixations near the beginnings and ends of \nwords, presumably because such refixations allow lexi-\ncal processing to continue from better viewing locations \n(Rayner, Sereno, & Raney, 1996; Vitu, McConkie, Kerr, \n& O’Regan, 2001).\nThe model as described thus far was explicitly designed \nto explain only the situation that occurs when the reader \nis proceeding through the text without any problems, \nwith ongoing lexical processing being the “engine” that \n“drives” the eyes forward. Consistent with this concep-\ntualization, the model has only been used to simulate the \ndata from eye-movement experiments in which sentences \ncontaining backward eye movements (i.e., regressions) \nhave been excluded, under the assumption that the major-\nity of these regressions reflect difficulty with higher level \nlanguage processing. Thus, with only a few exceptions, the \nmodel has said almost nothing about how higher level lan-\nguage processing influences eye movements during read-\ntion 2, e (1.15) is a free parameter that controls the degree \nto which visual acuity slows lexical processing, fixation \nis the location of the character space being fixated, let-\nter is the location of the central letter of the word being \nprocessed, and N is the number of letters in word n. The \nexponent in Equation 2 thus reflects the mean disparity \nbetween each of the letters in the word being processed \nand the fixation location from where the word is being \nprocessed.\n t (L\n1) \u0015 t(L1) eÈ|fixation \u0012 letter| /N (2)\nThe second stage of lexical processing in the model \nis L2, the completion of lexical access and the activation \nof word n’ s meaning. The duration of L 2, t(L2), is also \nsampled from a gamma distribution, with a mean speci-\nfied by Equation 3 ( SD \u0015 0.22 L\n2). Note that according \nto Equation 3, L2 is a fixed proportion of the duration of \nL1 (as specified by the lower branch of Equation 1) prior \nto being modulated by visual acuity. The free parameter \n\u0005 (.5) specifies this proportion. The rationale for these \nassumptions is that this later stage of lexical processing \ncorresponds to the process of accessing word n’ s mean-\ning (and therefore requires some nonzero amount of time \nto complete) and involves the processing of nonvisual \ncodes (and hence is not affected by visual acuity or word \nlength).\n t(L\n2) \u0015 L1\u0005\u0000 (3)\nAll of the remaining model assumptions are related to \nthe programming and execution of saccades. They can be \nbriefly summarized as follows (see Figure 1A; see Pol-\nlatsek et al., 2006c, for an in-depth discussion of these as-\nsumptions). First, saccades are programmed in two stages: \nan early, labile stage (M\n1) that can be canceled by the ini-\ntiation of subsequent saccadic programs, followed by a \nnonlabile stage (M\n2) that is not subject to cancellation. \nThe durations of these two programming stages, t(M1) and \nt(M2), are random deviates sampled from gamma distribu-\ntions (M \u0015 100 msec, SD \u0015 0.22; M \u0015 25 msec, SD \u0015 \n0.22, respectively).\nSecond, saccades are always directed toward the cen-\nters of words, but, because of both systematic and random \nmotor error, they often miss their intended targets. Equa-\ntions 4 through 6 specify the precise manner in which \nsaccades are executed in the model. In Equation 4, the \nlength of the saccade that is executed (in character spaces) \nis the sum of three terms: (1) the length of the saccade \nthat is actually being programmed; (2) a systematic error \ncomponent, as specified by Equation 5; and (3) a random \nerror component, as specified by Equation 6. The sys-\ntematic motor error causes short/long saccades to over-/\nundershoot their intended targets by some amount, with \nthe strength of this bias being modulated by the saccade \nlaunch-site fixation duration. In Equation 5, the free pa-\nrameter \u0016 (seven characters) defines the saccade length \nbias, and two other free parameters, \u0012\n1 (7.3) and \u00122 (3), \ndetermine how the strength of this bias is modulated by \nthe launch-site fixation duration. The random error com-\nponent is sampled from a Gaussian having a mean equal \nUSING E-Z READER TO MODEL LANGUAGE PROCESSING EFFECTS    5\nena (e.g., word frequency effects) that have been used to \nevaluate prior versions of E-Z Reader and other models of \neye-movement control, or the phenomena (e.g., interword \nregressions) that motivated the new assumptions of our \nmodel.\nThe preceding examples indicate how, on three separate \noccasions, assumptions about postlexical processing were \nincorporated into E-Z Reader. In all three examples, this \npostlexical processing normally lagged behind lexical pro-\ncessing, but occasionally intervened to slow or halt lexical \nprocessing and the forward progression of the eyes, caus-\ning both attention and the eyes to be directed back to the \nlocation of integration difficulty. In the new version of the \nmodel described below, this basic mechanism is retained, \nbut is more precisely specified.\nNew Assumptions\nFigure 1B is a schematic diagram of E-Z Reader 10. \nAs we will show, this model can be used to examine how \nthe time course of higher level, postlexical language pro-\ncessing might influence readers’ moment-to-moment de-\ncisions about when and where to move their eyes. This \nversion of E-Z Reader differs from its predecessor in that \nit includes two new assumptions.\nThe first new assumption is that shifting attention \nfrom one word to another during reading requires some \namount of time. This is indicated by the box labeled “A” \nin Figure 1B. This assumption was added in response to \ncriticism of the model’ s previous assumption, that atten-\ntion shifts from word n to word n\u00111 were instantaneous \n(Inhoff, Eiter, & Radach, 2005; Inhoff, Radach, & Eiter, \n2006; Radach, Deubel, & Heller, 2003; Radach, Reilly, & \nInhoff, 2007; however, for a rebuttal of these criticisms, \nsee Pollatsek, Reichle, & Rayner, 2006a, 2006b). In E-Z \nReader 10, the mean time required to shift attention, t(A), \nis now a random deviate that is sampled from a gamma \ndistribution with a mean equal to A \u0015 50 msec ( SD \u0015 \n0.22 A). The time required to shift attention from one \nword to the next is thus broadly consistent with several \nempirical estimates of how long it takes to move atten-\ntion (for a review, see Egeth & Y antis, 1997) and may be \nconservative, given evidence suggesting that attention \nshifts require only 4–33 msec per degree of visual angle\n2 \n(Eriksen & Schultz, 1977; Jolicœur, Ullman, & Mackay, \n1983; Posner, 1978; Shulman, Remington, & McLean, \n1979; Tsal, 1983). The fact that previous versions of the \nmodel were used only to simulate the forward progression \nof eye movements meant that attention shifts were always \nprogressive, ensuring that words were always identified in \ntheir correct order. However, in E-Z Reader 10, problems \nwith postlexical integration can occasionally result in re-\ngressive attention shifts.\nThe second new assumption of E-Z Reader 10 is that \na postlexical integration stage (labeled “I” in Figure 1B) \nbegins on word n immediately after its identification (i.e., \nafter the completion of L\n2 on word n). This stage is as-\nsumed to reflect all of the postlexical processing neces-\nsary to integrate word n into the higher level representa-\ntions that readers construct online—for example, linking \ning. These exceptions have mostly involved cases where \nad hoc assumptions were included to allow the model to \nsimulate particular experimental results. \nFor example, an assumption about postlexical process-\ning was added to E-Z Reader 7 (Reichle, Rayner, & Pol-\nlatsek, 2003) to simulate the patterns of eye movements \nobserved when Finnish speakers read Finnish sentences \ncontaining long compound words (Pollatsek, Reichle, \n& Rayner, 2003). Across several experiments (Hyönä & \nPollatsek, 1998; Pollatsek, Hyönä, & Bertram, 2000), the \nlengths and/or frequencies of both the compound words \nand their constituent morphemes were orthogonally ma-\nnipulated. The results of these experiments indicated that \nproperties of both the words and their constituents affected \nreaders’ eye movements, with earlier dependent measures \n(e.g., the durations of the first fixations on the words) \nreflecting properties of the first constituents, and later \nmeasures (e.g., gaze durations, or the sum of all fixation \ndurations during first-pass reading) reflecting properties \nof both the second constituents and the compounds. To \nsimulate these data, it was necessary to add a processing \nstage to the model in which the meanings of the individual \nconstituents (which were processed serially, much like in-\ndividual words in simulations of English) were combined \nto produce the overall meaning of the word. Because this \nprocess of combining the meanings of the two constitu-\nents was assumed to begin only after both of the constitu-\nents had been identified, this additional stage of meaning \ncomposition can be described as being postlexical.\nPostlexical processing was also added to E-Z Reader 9 \n(Pollatsek et al., 2006c) to explain why older readers are \nmore likely to first skip and then regress back to words \nthan are college-age readers (Rayner, Reichle, Stroud, \nWilliams, & Pollatsek, 2006). Three assumptions were \nnecessary to simulate this result. The first was that older \nreaders are more likely to take advantage of their addi-\ntional years of reading experience and use predictability to \nguess upcoming words, but sometimes these guesses are \nincorrect. The second was that incorrectly guessed words \nare identified as such during postlexical processing, pre-\nsumably because the meanings of the misidentified words \nare impossible to integrate into the overall meaning of the \nsentence. The final assumption was that the misidenti-\nfied words have to be reprocessed, resulting in interword \nregressions.\nFinally, prior to our development of E-Z Reader 10, a \npreliminary version of this model (i.e., one containing a \nsubset of the E-Z Reader 10 assumptions) was used to ex-\namine several possible explanations for why readers make \nlonger fixations on nouns in adjective–noun sequences \nwhen the adjectives are short in length, as compared with \nwhen they are long (i.e., the reverse word-length effect; \nPollatsek et al., 2008). This preliminary version included \na stage of postlexical processing and an assumption that \nattention requires some amount of time to shift from one \nword to the next, but differed from E-Z Reader 10 in this \narticle in several important ways (see Pollatsek et al., \n2008). More important, the preliminary version was not \nevaluated with respect to either the benchmark phenom-\n6     R EICHLE, WARREN, AND MCCONNELL\nnomena simulated below (i.e., the pauses that occur at \nclause boundaries; Just & Carpenter, 1980) does not in-\nvolve difficulty with lexical processing per se.\nSecond, regarding the assumption that a word’ s pre-\ndictability may help to constrain its identity only if the \nprior word has already been integrated: This assumption \nis based on the fact that a word’ s cloze predictability re-\nflects all of the lexical and postlexical constraints that are \npredictive of that word’ s identity after all of the preced-\ning words have been fully processed (Balota et al., 1985; \nEhrlich & Rayner, 1981; Rayner et al., 2004; Rayner & \nWell, 1996). As such, cloze predictability reflects a va-\nriety of different constraints, including those that are \nimposed by both low-level (e.g., semantic priming) and \nhigh-level (e.g., syntactic constraints) processing. In the \nsimulations reported below, we adopted the conservative \nassumption that the predictability of word n is set equal \nto 0 when calculating the durations of L\n1 and/or L2 (see \nEquations 1 and 3), if the integration of word n\u00121 has \nnot completed by the time lexical processing (i.e., L1 and/\nor L2) of word n begins. This assumption is conservative \nbecause it ignores the (probably weak) contributions of \nthe lower level sources of predictability (e.g., semantic \npriming), and because it imposes a (nontrivial) constraint \non the rate of lexical processing.\nThird, regarding the assumption that failure to integrate \nword n prior to the identification of word n\u00111 results in \ncomprehension difficulty: The intuition behind this as-\nsumption is that, in some cases, integrative processing \non word n may not converge quickly or even at all, so \nthat integration of word n\u00111 will not be possible. We hy-\npothesize that, in such situations, the default process is \nto interrupt the forward movement of the eyes and atten-\ntion and to make a regression back to the point at which \nprocessing difficulty was first encountered (per the fifth \nassumption; see below).\nFourth, regarding the probability p\nF, that integration \n“fails,” resulting in comprehension difficulty, the intuition \nbehind this assumption is that, for a variety of different rea-\nsons (e.g., perceptual errors; Pollatsek et al., 2008), the in-\ntegration of a word can sometimes fail. Sometimes this fail-\nure occurs rapidly enough to result in an immediate pause \nand/or a regression (again, per the fifth assumption). In the \nsimulations reported below, we will provide examples of \nhow rapidly occurring problems with integration can result \nin patterns of eye movements that have, until now, been ex-\nplained in only a very cursory, verbal manner.\nFifth, regarding our assumption that following com-\nprehension failure, the eyes and attention will, with prob-\nability p\nN, be directed back to word n, the location where \ncomprehension difficulty was first encountered: This is a \nsimplifying assumption based on findings that the aver-\nage length of readers’ initial regressive eye movements \nare often quite short, moving the eyes back only a word or \ntwo (Rayner & Pollatsek, 1989; Vitu & McConkie, 2000), \nalthough this length may be correlated with how much \nsentential material appears before the integration break-\ndown (Apel, Henderson, & Ferreira, 2007). There is also \nsome evidence that readers are capable of accurately di-\nword n into a syntactic structure, generating a context-\nappropriate semantic representation, and incorporating its \nmeaning into a discourse model. Note that, as with our \nassumptions about both attention and lexical processing, \nour assumptions about postlexical language processing \nare intended to be only a high-level description of how \nthis stage of processing interacts with lexical processing \nand attention, and thereby affects readers’ eye movements. \nIn other words, the integration stage shown in Figure 1B \nis a placeholder for a deeper theory of postlexical lan-\nguage processing during reading. Our goal in including \nthis stage is therefore quite modest: to provide a tentative \naccount of how—within the framework of the E-Z Reader \nmodel—postlexical variables might affect readers’ eye \nmovements. Finally, we make six specific assumptions \nabout this postlexical stage: (1) The time required to com-\nplete I, t(I), is sampled from a gamma distribution having \na mean of I \u0015 25 msec (SD \u0015 0.22 I); (2) the predictability \ninformation that is normally used to constrain the identity \nof word n\u00111 (see Equations 1 and 3) is available only after \nword n has been integrated; (3) the failure to integrate \nword n before the identification of word n\u00111 constitutes \nintegration failure, resulting in comprehension difficulty; \n(4) with probability p\nF, the integration of word n fails, \nalso resulting in comprehension difficulty; (5) either type \nof integration failure will, with probability p\nN, cause both \nthe eyes and attention to be directed back to the point at \nwhich the difficulty became evident (i.e., word n), as op-\nposed to some earlier sentence location (with probability \n1 \u0012 p\nN); and (6) regressive saccades require some addi-\ntional amount of time to program, as compared with pro-\ngressive saccades. The new assumptions about attention \nand postlexical integration thus add five new free param-\neters to the model—A, I, p\nF, pN, and the extra time that \nis necessary to program regressions. In what follows, we \nwill provide justifications for these assumptions.\nFirst, regarding the duration of I: Although 25 msec \nmay seem very short, our assumption is that the duration \nof I reflects the minimal amount of postlexical process-\ning that (on average) is necessary to satisfy the language-\n processing system that comprehension is proceeding \nwithout difficulty and that it is not necessary to interrupt \nlexical processing and/or halt the progression of the eyes. \nThis assumption does not preclude the possibility that ad-\nditional postlexical processing occurs on many or even all \nwords. Our conceptualization of postlexical processing is \nthus broadly consistent with the “good enough” view of \nlanguage processing (Ferreira, Bailey, & Ferraro, 2002; \nFerreira & Patson, 2007; Swets, Desmet, Clifton, & Fer-\nreira, 2008) and with work by Sanford and colleagues \n(Sanford, 2002; Sanford & Garrod, 2005), in that we are \nassuming that complete incremental postlexical process-\ning is not always required and may not always occur. Fi-\nnally, although one could hypothesize that words that are \ndifficult to identify should also be difficult to integrate—\nthat is, that t(I) should be correlated with t(L\n1) and t(L2)—\nwe adopted the simplifying assumption of independence \nbetween lexical and postlexical processing to make the \nmodeling less complicated, and because one of the phe-\nUSING E-Z READER TO MODEL LANGUAGE PROCESSING EFFECTS    7\nfix the problem. We make no attempt to explain how the \nlanguage system does this; but to avoid potential problems \nassociated with infinite loops (e.g., due to integration’ s \nalways failing on a particular word), we assumed that the \nprobability of integration failure was very small during \nthe second pass through the sentence.\nFinally, we assumed that regressive saccades take an \nadditional 30 msec to program (i.e., M\n1 for regressions \nis increased by 30 msec), consistent with results showing \nthat regressions to previously fixated viewing locations \nrequire an additional 20–36 msec to initiate or program \n(Rayner, Juhasz, Ashby, & Clifton, 2003). This 30-msec \nconstant is added to all regressive saccades in all of the \nsimulations reported below.\nThe main consequences of the preceding assumptions \nare schematically illustrated in Figure 2. The situation \ndepicted in Figure 2A is the most frequently occurring \none: Comprehension is proceeding without difficulty, \nand the eyes are continuing to move forward along the \nline of text. We will refer to this as the “default” reading \nprocess. In Figure 2A, the first stage of lexical processing \n(L\n1) of word n completes, causing the oculomotor system \nrecting their gaze back to sources of processing difficulty, \nrather than, for example, simply rereading the entire sen-\ntence (Frazier & Rayner, 1982; Kennedy, Brooks, Flynn, \n& Prophet, 2003; Kennedy & Murray, 1987; however, \ncf. Weger & Inhoff, 2007). However, to fully implement \ndirected long-distance regressions like this in our model \nwould require a more detailed account of language pro-\ncessing and reanalysis. It would also require an account of \nhow the spatial coordinates of the words are represented \nin memory. To make our modeling possible in the absence \nof such accounts, we adopted the simplifying assumption \nthat whatever comprehension problem occurred during \nthe integration of word n will, with probability p\nN, cause \nthe eyes and attention to be directed back to word n, and \nwith probability 1 \u0012 pN, cause the eyes and attention to \nbe directed back to some earlier location in the sentence. \nFor the sake of convenience, this earlier location was al-\nways defined to be word n\u00121. Our assumption is that by \nmoving the eyes and attention back to the “problematic” \nword (whether it be n or n\u00121), that word can be repro-\ncessed (i.e., L\n1, L2, and I are completed a second time \non the word), allowing the language system to attempt to \nABC\nword n word n+1 word n word n+1 word n word n+1\nFigure 2. Schematic diagram showing three possible sequences of events that \ncan occur in E-Z Reader 10. In all three panels, arrows indicate completed pro-\ncesses and solid circles indicate terminated processes. Panel A depicts the most \ncommon situation—when integration occurs without difficulty. The completion \nof the first stage of lexical processing (L\n1) of word n results in the continua-\ntion of the second stage (L2) and the initiation of a saccadic program (M1) to \nmove the eyes to word n\u00111. The completion of L2 causes attention (A) to shift \nto word n\u00111 and initiates postlexical integration (I) of word n. As soon as at-\ntention finishes shifting to word n\u00111 (represented by the dotted line labeled \n“a”), lexical processing (L1) of that word begins. The nonlabile stage of saccadic \nprogramming (M2) then completes and the saccade is executed (S), moving the \neyes to word n\u00111 (represented by the dotted line “b”). (Parafoveal processing \nof word n\u00111 thus occurs in the time interval between “a” and “b.”) Finally, the \nmeaning of word n is integrated (indicated by “c”) before lexical processing (L2) \nof word n\u00111 finishes, and the eyes continue to move forward. Panel B shows the \nsituation where the integration (I) of word n fails to complete before the lexical \nprocessing (L2) of word n\u00111 completes. With this “stalling out” of integration, \nthe labile saccadic program to move the eyes to word n \u0011 2 is canceled, and both \nthe eyes and attention are drawn back to the location where comprehension \ndifficulty first became apparent (represented by the gray arrows labeled “A” \nand “M\n1”). Finally, panel C shows what can happen when the early detection of \na violation during the integration (I) of word n results in the termination of in-\ntegrative processing, interrupting lexical processing (A, L1, or L2) of word n\u00111 \nand causing both the eyes and attention to move back.\n8     R EICHLE, WARREN, AND MCCONNELL\nthe eyes back a word or two. Although this is sufficient \nto explain regressions that result from relatively local in-\ntegration problems that are rapidly noticed by the reader, \nour assumptions are not sufficient to explain regressions \nthat result from earlier processing difficulty or problems \nthat are noticed only after some delay. As a result, the \nmodel cannot explain long-distance regressions. How-\never, in order for the model to capture such long-distance \nregressions, it would require a full articulation of lan-\nguage processing, instead of our simple assumptions \nabout how postlexical processing interacts with lexical \nprocessing, and it would also need an account of how a \nreader’ s spatial representation of the text allows him or \nher to regress back to locations indicated by the model \nof language processing. Such an account is beyond the \nscope of our model.\nSimulation Results\nThe simulations reported below were completed using \nthe sentences from the Schilling et al. (1998) corpus as \n“frames” to examine how the variables associated with \nthe target words in each of the experimental conditions \nwould affect the simulated patterns of eye movements on \nthose target words.\n3 The corpus consists of 48 indepen-\ndent sentences, each containing 8–14 words. Although \nsuch sentences are probably not representative of the types \nof sentences that readers normally encounter in naturally \noccurring connected discourse, simulations using French \npassages (Miellet, Sparrow, & Sereno, 2007) and Chinese \nsentences (Rayner, Li, & Pollatsek, 2007) have indicated \nthat the basic principles of the E-Z Reader model seem to \nbe robust enough to generalize beyond the type of simple \nEnglish sentences of our corpus. In addition, in all of the \nsimulations of the experiments reported below, the critical \n(target) words from actual sentences that were used in the \nexperiments were inserted into the Schilling et al. sentence \nframes as proxies for the full sentences. For example, in \nour simulation of the Warren and McConnell (2007) ex-\nperiment examining plausibility and violations of selec-\ntional restrictions, the actual target words that were used \nin that experiment (word n) and the words immediately \nbefore (word n\u00121) and after (word n\u00111) the targets were \nembedded in the Schilling et al. sentences. These critical \nwords were embedded into random locations (but were \nnever the first or last word) in order to avoid potential bi-\nases in what the model was doing immediately before and \nafter encountering the critical words. We will say more \nabout how this was done as the various simulations are \ndescribed.\nEach simulation was completed using 1,000 Monte \nCarlo runs of the model per condition; the predicted mea-\nsures that are reported (e.g., gaze durations) were com-\nputed exactly as in the simulated experiments. With the \nexceptions that are discussed next, the values of the free \nparameters were (unless otherwise indicated) set equal to \nthe values that were used in previously published simula-\ntions and that were based on estimates of the time required \nto identify words, to program saccades, and so on (for an \noverview of these parameters and their values, see Pol-\nlatsek et al., 2006c, or Reichle et al., 2006).\nto begin programming a saccade (M\n1) to move the eyes to \nword n\u00111. While this is happening, the second stage of \nlexical processing (L2) finishes, initiating the postlexical \nintegration (I) of that word and an attention shift (A) to \nthe next. After some amount of time, attention finishes \nshifting to word n\u00111 (indicated by the dotted line labeled \n“a”), and lexical processing (L\n1) of that word begins. Be-\ncause word n is still being integrated, however, the lexical \nprocessing of word n\u00111 does not benefit from whatever \ninformation is known about that word’ s predictability. In-\ntegration of word n and lexical processing of word n\u00111 \ncontinue, while the second stage of saccadic programming \n(M\n2) completes, and a saccade (S) is executed to move the \neyes to word n\u00111 (the dotted line labeled “b”). Parafoveal \nprocessing of word n\u00111 thus occurs from word n in the \ntime interval between “a” and “b.” Finally, integration of \nword n completes (dotted line labeled “c”), while both \nlexical processing and the eyes continue their forward pro-\ngression. It is important to note that although the lexical \nprocessing of word n\u00111 did not benefit from the use of \npredictability information, the relative time course of in-\ntegration versus lexical processing is often such that pre-\ndictable words are processed more rapidly (and sometimes \neven skipped) more than are less predictable words.\nFigure 2B illustrates one situation that can disrupt the de-\nfault reading process—in this case, word n is so difficult to \nintegrate that its integration lags far behind ongoing lexical \nprocessing, causing problems with the postlexical process-\ning of word n\u00111. In the situation depicted in the figure, \nword n\u00111 is identified (i.e., L\n2 completes) before word n \nhas been integrated, which, by our third assumption, halts \nboth the postlexical processing (I) of word n and the forward \nmovement of the eyes (e.g., in this example, M\n1 is canceled), \nso that both attention and the eyes can be directed back to \nthe source of processing difficulty (as indicated by the gray \narrows labeled “A” and “M\n1,” respectively). The intuition \nbehind this assumption is that the severity of comprehen-\nsion problems arising from the slow postlexical processing \nof a word can be minimized by allowing such slowdowns to \n“put the brakes on” the default reading process.\nFinally, Figure 2C illustrates a second situation that \ncan disrupt the default reading process—rapid integra-\ntion failure. In this situation, the early detection of a vio-\nlation results in the termination of integrative process-\ning (e.g., as might occur if one attempts to integrate a \nword into an incompatible syntactic structure; Frazier & \nRayner, 1982). In the example, integration on word n ter-\nminates before the labile saccadic program (M\n1) to move \nthe eyes from word n to word n\u00111 has completed. This \ncauses lexical processing (L 1) of word n\u00111 to stop and \nattention (A) to be directed back from word n\u00111. But \ninstead of the eyes moving back from word n\u00111, the la-\nbile program that would have moved the eyes forward is \ncanceled, increasing the duration of the (first) fixation \non word n, and sometimes resulting in an intraword or \ninterword regression (because of saccadic error) back to \nword n\u00121.\nOf course, we acknowledge that our assumptions re-\ngarding interword regressions are limited, because they \nexplain only the relatively short regressions that move \nUSING E-Z READER TO MODEL LANGUAGE PROCESSING EFFECTS    9\nwould affect the model’ s overall performance. To do \nthis, we first examined the model’ s performance on the \nSchilling et al. (1998) sentence corpus and compared this \nperformance with that of E-Z Reader 9 (Pollatsek et al., \n2006c). The results of this first simulation are shown in \nTable 1, which displays the word-based means for six de-\npendent measures for five classes of words (based on their \nfrequency of occurrence) in the Schilling et al. corpus. \nThese means were calculated excluding trials that con-\ntained interword regressions. Consequently, in the simu-\nlation using E-Z Reader 10, only the inclusion of the two \nnew processes (50 msec for attention shifts and 25 msec \nfor postlexical integration) were evaluated; integration \nfailure was not allowed ( p\nF \u0015 0). The observed data re-\nflected only those sentences that were read by the partici-\npants without difficulty (i.e., trials that did not contain in-\nterword regressions). Any simulation trials that contained \ninter word regressions due to slow integration or oculomo-\ntor error were excluded from our analyses.\nAs Table 1 shows, our new assumptions do not ad-\nversely affect the model’ s ability to fit the Schilling et al. \n(1998) corpus. This can be seen by comparing the means \npredicted by E-Z Reader 10 with its assumptions about at-\ntention and postlexical processing with both the observed \nmeans and those predicted by E-Z Reader 9. More for-\nmally, the model’ s goodness of fit can be quantified using \nthe root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between the \nobserved and predicted means (see note 3), with smaller \nRMSDs indicating better overall fits. Using this measure, \nE-Z Reader 10’ s fit is actually slightly better than that of \nits predecessor: 0.107 versus 0.153, respectively.\n4 This re-\nsult indicates that our new assumptions do not adversely \naffect the model’ s capacity to simulate the empirical re-\nsults that it was originally designed to simulate. \nThe second exploratory simulation investigated how \nthe probability of rapid integration failure, p\nF, affected \nthe model’ s overall performance and the overall rate of \nmaking interword regressions. The results of this second \nsimulation are shown in Figure 3. In this simulation, the \nprobability of integration failure, p\nF, was incrementally \nincreased from 0 to 1 (in 0.1 increments) for all of the \nwords in all of the sentences, in order to determine how \nintegration failure would influence the model’ s overall \nperformance. As in the previous simulation, the values \nof A and I were set equal to 50 and 25 msec, respectively. \nThe changes were as follows: First, the values of the \nfour parameters that control the rate of lexical processing \nwere adjusted to decrease the time required to identify \nwords, and thereby to offset the additional time required \nfor shifting attention between words. The values of (\n1, (2, \n(3, and \u0005 (see Equations 1 and 3) were thus respectively \nchanged from 122, 4, 10, and 0.5 (the values used in E-Z \nReader 9) to 98, 2, 27, and 0.25 (the values used in E-Z \nReader 10). The mean time to complete the labile stage of \nsaccadic programming, M\n1, was increased from 100 msec \n(E-Z Reader 9) to 125 msec (E-Z Reader 10) to compen-\nsate for this speedup in lexical processing; increasing the \nvalue of this parameter slowed saccadic programming, \nwhich in turn increased the mean durations of the fixa-\ntions. The absolute sizes of these adjustments were fairly \nmodest and are still consistent with empirical estimates of \nword identification and saccadic programming latencies. \nFor example, the mean time to identify the most frequent \nword, the, when it is directly fixated and its predictability \nis 0 is 183 msec in E-Z Reader 9 and 159 msec in E-Z \nReader 10. Similarly, the smaller value of the \u0005 parameter \nensures that the mean predicted preview effect (across the \nfull range of word frequencies, with predictability equal \nto 0 and ignoring the effect of visual acuity) is compa-\nrable for the two versions of the model: 75 msec for E-Z \nReader 9 and 78 msec for E-Z Reader 10.\nFinally, the value of R, the parameter that determines the \ndelay between when a word is first fixated and when the \ndecision about whether to refixate the word is made, was \nreduced from 117 msec (E-Z Reader 9) to 0 msec (E-Z \nReader 10). This change was motivated by the assumption \nthat the feedback required to determine that the eyes had \nlanded in a poor viewing location (i.e., one that affords \na poor view of the word) is not based on visual informa-\ntion (as was previously assumed in E-Z Reader 9), but is \ninstead based on efference copies of the saccade programs \n(Carpenter, 2000). This new assumption regarding correc-\ntive refixations is consistent with what is assumed in other \nmodels of eye-movement control during reading (e.g., \nEngbert et al., 2005). To keep the proportion of refixations \ncomparable in E-Z Reader 10, the value of the parameter \nthat modulates the tendency to refix (see Equation 7) was \nalso reduced from  \u0015 0.09 to  \u0015 0.05.\nThe first three simulations were completed in order to \ninvestigate how the new assumptions of E-Z Reader 10 \nTable 1 \nMean Observed (Schilling, Rayner, & Chumbley, 1998) and Simulated (E-Z Reader 9 vs. E-Z Reader 10)  \nFixation Durations (in Milliseconds) and Probabilities, As a Function of Word Frequency\nFirst-Fixation Single-Fixation Probability 1 Probability 2 \u0011\nWord Frequency Duration Duration Gaze Duration Fixation Fixations Probability Skip\n(Occurrences/Million)  Obs.  9  10  Obs.  9  10  Obs.  9  10  Obs.  9  10  Obs.  9  10  Obs.  9  10\n1–10 248 251 246 265 259 256 292 295 293 .68 .75 .69 .20 .15 .16 .10 .09 .15\n11–100 234 239 241 249 244 247 272 275 278 .70 .74 .69 .16 .13 .13 .13 .12 .18\n101–1,000 228 225 230 243 226 233 256 241 249 .68 .75 .68 .10 .06 .07 .22 .19 .26\n1,001–10,000 223 217 224 235 217 225 234 220 228 .44 .52 .50 .02 .01 .01 .55 .47 .50\n10,001\u0011 208 214 214 216 215 214 214 216 217 .32 .42 .38 .01 .00 .01 .67 .58 .61\nNote—Goodness of fit, as measured by the RMSDs (smaller values indicate better fits), between the observed and simulated means are E-Z Reader 9, \nRMSD \u0015 0.153; E-Z Reader 10, RMSD \u0015 0.107.\n10    R EICHLE, WARREN, AND MCCONNELL\na sentence containing one or more interword regressions \nis rather modest (p \u0003 .6) for pF values of 0.4 or less. This \nis interesting because, as previously mentioned, the E-Z \nReader model was designed to explain only what we have \ncalled the “default” reading process; in fitting the model \nto the Schilling et al. (1998) sentence corpus, all trials \nthat included interword regressions were excluded from \nconsideration. As a result, only 36% of the original data \nwere actually included in the corpus, which suggests that \nif the assumptions of the model are correct, integration \nfailure occurred on approximately 40% of the words. Of \ncourse, this conclusion remains tentative, because it ig-\nnores the possibility that some interword regressions may \nhave stemmed from other problems. For example, some \nportion of the regressions may reflect problems associated \nwith incomplete lexical processing, as is posited by the \nSWIFT model of eye-movement control (Engbert et al., \n2005). More will be said about these different possible \nsources of interword regressions in the Discussion.\nFinally, the third exploratory simulation investigated \nhow the parametric manipulation of the duration of the \nintegration stage, t(I), and the probability of rapid inte-\ngration failure, p\nF, would affect the patterns of eye move-\nments on specific target words. To do this, we set the prop-\nerties of the Schilling et al. (1998) target words (word n) \nand the preceding (word n\u00121) and following (word n\u00111) \nwords equal to fixed values (frequencies \u0015 10 per million, \nlengths \u0015 6 letters, predictabilities \u0015 0.05). The proper-\nties of these word triplets were controlled in this manner \nin order to determine how the parametric manipulation of \nt(I) and p\nF would affect the resulting patterns of simulated \neye movements in a context devoid of any variability, due \nto the properties of the words themselves. The values of \nt(I) and p\nF were incrementally and orthogonally varied \nfor word n, and the value of pN was set equal to 1. Four \ndependent measures were then calculated on word n: the \nmean first-fixation and gaze durations, the total viewing \ntimes, and the probabilities of making interword regres-\nsions back to word n. The results of this simulation are \nshown in Figure 4.\nFigure 4A shows the predicted first-fixation durations, \nand Figure 4B shows the predicted gaze durations. Both \nmeasures increase monotonically with values of p\nF, but \nfirst increase and then decrease with values of t(I). The \nformer pattern reflects the situation that was described in \nFigure 2C: As p\nF increases, so does the probability that \nthe resulting integration failure will cancel whatever labile \nsaccade would have otherwise moved the eyes forward, \nresulting in a pause (increasing both the first-fixation and \ngaze durations) and/or a refixation (increasing the gaze \nduration). From a theoretical perspective, this result is in-\nteresting, because it suggests that problems with postlexi-\ncal integration can sometimes have very rapid effects, \ninfluencing the first-fixation duration on the word being \nintegrated, but that this situation happens only when the \nintegration failure occurs before the labile program to \nmove the eyes forward has completed.\nThe nonmonotonic relationship that is observed in Fig-\nures 4A and 4B between t(I) and both the first-fixation and \ngaze durations reflects the fact that after a certain amount \nThe model’ s performance was again evaluated using its \nfit to the Schilling et al. (1998) corpus, as measured using \nRMSDs. Because one of the main reasons for running \nthis simulation is to determine how the inclusion of inter-\nword regressions would affect the model’ s performance, \nthe RMSDs were calculated using all simulation trials. In \nother words, sentences containing interword regressions \nwere not excluded from our analyses, as they had been \nin the previous simulation. For the sake of simplicity, all \nregressions were directed back to the word that was the \nsource of integration difficulty ( p\nN \u0015 1). Finally, we also \ncalculated the mean probability that a given sentence con-\ntained one or more interword regressions, which, along \nwith the RMSDs, are plotted as a function of p\nF values \nin Figure 3.\nAs Figure 3 indicates, for pF values of 0.4 or less, the \nmodel’ s overall capacity to explain the various fixation \nmeasures remains fairly robust, with RMSDs increas-\ning only slightly, from 0.107 to 0.432 (see note 4). This \nsuggests that the inclusion of a 25-msec integration stage \nthat fails for some nontrivial percentage of the words (up \nto 40%) has only a modest effect on the model’ s over-\nall ability to describe what happens during reading when \ncomprehension is proceeding without too much difficulty \nand the dominant pattern of eye movements is normal \n(moving forward), but with occasional regressions.

Similarly, as p\nF increases, the first-fixation \nand gaze durations on word n increase for the reasons \ndiscussed above, and in cases involving large values of \nt(I), an increasing p\nF increases the probability of making \nregressions back from word n\u00111. The latter explanation \ninvolving regressions is supported by Figure 4D, which \nshows the mean probability of making a regression into \nof time has elapsed, the likelihood of completing the la-\nbile stage of saccadic programming increases dramatically, \nmaking the execution of that saccade obligatory, and thereby \nincreasing the proportion of trials in which the eyes move \nfrom word n to word n\u00111 before regressing back to word n \n(similar to the situation described in Figure 2B).

The following results summarize \nwhat has been reported in eye-movement experiments that \nhave examined clause wrap-up: (1) Gaze durations are \nlonger on words ending sentences than on comma-marked \nclauses (Hirotani et al., 2006) and longer on words end-\ning comma-marked clauses than on clause-internal words \n(Hirotani et al., 2006; Rayner et al., 2000); (2) these lon-\nger gaze durations are due to more intraword regressions \n(Rayner et al., 2000); (3) readers are less likely to re-\ngress across a punctuation-marked boundary than across \nno boundary or an unmarked boundary (Hirotani et al., \n2006); and (4) saccades into new clauses or sentences are \nlonger than within-clause saccades (Hirotani et al., 2006; \nRayner et al., 2000). These effects have classically been \nthought to reflect the end-of-clause processing that is as-\nsociated with completing any unfinished, within-clause \ninterpretation and with performing intraclause or sentence \nintegration (Just & Carpenter, 1980). \nIf clause wrap-up effects are related to readers’ comple-\ntion of unfinished, postlexical processing at the end of a \nclause, they are suitable for modeling with E-Z Reader 10. \nThis is because if the final word of a clause or sentence \nis more prone to integration failure, this will increase \nthe probability of either refixating that word or regress-\ning back to the previous word. The model might there-\nfore predict refixations on, and/or regressions back from, \nclause-final words. To test this hypothesis and to examine \nthe model’ s capacity for accounting for clause wrap-up \neffects, we completed a simulation that was loosely based \non the Rayner et al. (2000) experiment that was described \nabove.\nTo complete these simulations, we again used the Schil-\nling et al. (1998) sentence frames (see note 3) in order to \nexamine the consequences of the manipulations of inter-\nest on the simulated eye movements. In the simulations, \nwe examined the consequence of having nouns in either \nclause-final positions (e.g., “. . . owned the instrument, al-\nready . . .”) or non-clause-final positions (e.g., “. . . owned \nthe instrument already, . . .”) within sentences. Table 2 \nshows the observed values of four dependent measures that \nwere observed in these two conditions—the first- fixation \nand gaze durations on the nouns, as well as the probabili-\nword n as a function of t(I) and p\nF; as was true of the \ntotal viewing times, this dependent measure also increases \nmonotonically with both parameters.\nWhat are the implications of the preceding simulations? \nThe first is that the addition of some nonzero amount of \ntime (on average, 50 msec) to move attention from one \nword to another does not disrupt the model’ s overall per-\nformance. The addition of this assumption allows us to \ncounter criticism (Inhoff et al., 2006; Radach et al., 2003; \nRadach et al., 2007) that has been made against earlier \nversions of E-Z Reader—that the model is not plausible, \nbecause it assumes that the process of shifting attention \nfrom one word to the next is instantaneous (Egeth & \nY antis, 1997). As postulated elsewhere (Pollatsek et al., \n2006a, 2000b; Rayner, Pollatsek, & Reichle, 2003), these \ncriticisms can be addressed by simply positing that some \nsmall portion of the time that is normally required for \nidentifying a given word—such as some small portion of \nt(L\n2)—also subsumes the time that is required for shifting \nattention to or from that word. The present simulations \nindicate that this solution is feasible, thus providing proof \nagainst claims that the addition of an explicit attention-\nshifting time would be fatal to the model’ s performance.\nThese simulations also demonstrate that a postlexi-\ncal stage of language processing can run invisibly in the \nbackground of ongoing lexical processing—even though \nthis higher level stage of processing requires a nonzero \namount of time (in our simulations, an average of 25 msec \nper word) to complete, and even though one aspect of lexi-\ncal processing (the use of word predictability information) \nis contingent on its completion. The next set of simula-\ntions provides a more explicit test of the consequences \nof lengthening the duration of the postlexical integration \nstage and the probability of its failing in order to determine \nwhether this manipulation can account for the patterns of \npauses and/or regressions that have been observed when \nreaders encounter problems with postlexical processing. \nIn the first of these simulations, we examined the model’ s \ncapacity to explain clause wrap-up effects.\nA clause wrap-up effect  is an example of a relatively \nrobust effect that has, in the eye-movement literature, \ngenerally been attributed to higher level linguistic pro-\ncessing (Just & Carpenter, 1980; Rayner, Sereno, Mor-\nris, Schmauder, & Clifton, 1989). This effect refers to the \nfinding that readers tend to fixate longer on, and make \nTable 2 \nObserved (Rayner, Kambe, & Duffy, 2000) and Simulated  \n(E-Z Reader 10) Wrap-Up Effects on Clause-Final (CF)  \nand Non-Clause-Final (NCF) Nouns, in Milliseconds\nObserved Simulated\nDependent Measure  CF  NCF  Difference  CF  NCF  Difference\nFirst-fixation duration 272 271  1 263 260  3\nGaze duration 316 294 22 308 287 21\nProbability of refixation .14 .09 .05 .16 .10 .06\nProbability of regression .07 .13 \u0012.06 .08 .13 \u0012.05\nNote—For non-clause-final words, t(I) \u0015 25 msec; pF \u0015 0; pN \u0015 0.59.

These parameter values \nminimized the RMSDs between the observed and simu-\nlated refixation and regression probabilities in the two \nconditions.\nAs Table 2 shows, the model does a fairly good job of \ncapturing the absolute values of the four reported depen-\ndent measures, as well as the effects of the experimental \nmanipulation (e.g., as indicated by the columns show-\ning the difference scores). Note that the model correctly \nsimulates the finding that gaze durations are longer in \nthe clause-final than in the non-clause-final conditions \n(observed difference, M \u0015 22 msec; simulated differ-\nence, M \u0015 21 msec). Moreover, the model accurately \ncaptures the fact that this difference largely reflects the \nhigher probability of making a refixation in the clause-\nfinal condition, and that it is not due to an increase in the \nfirst-fixation durations. Finally, the model accurately pre-\ndicts the correct pattern of regressions, with fewer regres-\nsions being directed back from words that follow clause \nboundaries than from words that do not. These simulation \nresults suggest that the additional time required to com-\nplete the postlexical processing of a clause-final word, \nin conjunction with our assumptions that this processing \nis more prone to failure and more likely to result in in-\nterword regressions back from the sources of integration \ndifficulty, provides a viable explanation of the types of \nclause wrap-up effects that were reported by Rayner et al. \n(2000) and others (Hill & Murray, 2000; Hirotani et al., \n2006; Rayner et al., 1989). Our manipulation of the p\nF pa-\nrameter is loosely consistent with the notion that readers \nmay set a higher threshold for coherence or integration at \nclause boundaries than at clause-internal positions, mak-\ning integration failure more likely to occur.\nUp to this point, our simulations have focused on how \ndifficulty with postlexical integration interrupts the for-\nward movement of the eyes, resulting in regressions back \nfrom the location of the integration difficulty. We believe \nthat our assumptions about postlexical integration have \nbeen successful in this capacity, although we readily ac-\nknowledge that our assumptions are too simple to account \nfor the full range of effects that stem from higher level, \npostlexical language processing. As the last simulation \nshowed, the consequences of integration difficulty can \nbe fairly rapid, influencing the probability of making re-\nfixations and thereby influencing the gaze duration on a \nword.\nRecently, however, there have been some demonstra-\ntions that effects due to higher level, postlexical language \nprocessing can manifest even more rapidly than this, \nsometimes even influencing the duration of the initial \nfixation on a word (for a review, see Clifton et al., 2007). \nSome examples have come from experiments that exam-\nined how world knowledge affects language comprehen-\nsion during reading (e.g., Warren & McConnell, 2007). It \nis important to determine whether—and if so, how—the \nassumptions of E-Z Reader 10 can account for such find-\nings. To make this determination, we used the model to \nsimulate the results of an eye-movement experiment that \nexamined how selectional restriction violations (i.e., vio-\nties of refixating the nouns and the probabilities of mak-\ning regressions back into the nouns from the postnoun \nregion. The latter measure is included, because it indicates \nthe relative likelihood of making regressions across clause \nboundaries in the two conditions. All of these measures \nare collapsed across conditions of the Rayner et al. (2000) \nexperiment involving low-typical versus high-typical \nnouns, because this manipulation was irrelevant to the \nissues being explored—the nature of clause wrap-up ef-\nfects. The important points to note about the observed data \nare that first-fixation durations are not affected by clause \nwrap-up, but gaze durations are, and the probability of \nmaking a regression across the clause boundary (i.e., the \nlocation marked by a comma) is less than the probability \nof making a regression in the same location when it is not \na clause boundary. Our hypothesis was that these effects \ncould be accounted for by manipulating the characteristics \nof postlexical integration in the model.\nTable 2 also shows the values that the model generated \nfor these same dependent measures. These results were \nobtained by first embedding the critical nouns (word n) \nand the words immediately before (word n\u00121) and after \n(word n\u00111) them into 32 of the Schilling et al. (1998) \nsentences. This was done to ensure that the properties of \nthese words were as closely matched as possible across \nthe experiment and simulation. Because the cloze pre-\ndictabilities of these words were not known, the predict-\nabilities of words n and n\u00111 were set equal to 0; however, \nbecause word n\u00121 was the in 29 of the 32 Rayner et al. \n(2000) sentences, its predictability was set equal to 0.9. \n(The qualitative pattern of the simulation results is not \ndependent on these assumptions about predictability.) The \nlength of word n\u00111 was also set equal to nine letters to \nbetter equate these words to the postnouns regions (which \nactually consisted of one to three words) that were used \nby Rayner et al. (2000). Finally, the lengths of the clause-\nfinal words were also increased by one character to repre-\nsent the presence of the clause-marking comma.\nThe simulation used the same parameter values used in \nprevious simulations. Although one could argue that this \nis overly conservative (because the Rayner et al., 2000, \nexperiment used participants and materials different from \nthose that were used to select the model’ s parameter val-\nues), we would counter that this conservative approach \nprovides a stronger test of the model’ s core assumptions. \nTo test our hypothesis about clause wrap-up being related \nto t(I), we attempted to simulate the observed pattern of \nresults by setting the duration of t(I) equal to 86 msec for \nthe clause-final words and 25 msec (i.e., the parameter’ s \ndefault value) for all of the other words. The probabil-\nity that this postlexical processing would result in some \ntype of integration failure, p\nF, was set equal to 0.12 for \nthe clause-final nouns, 0.23 for the postnoun clause-final \nwords, and 0 for all of the other words in the sentences. \nThe probability that such failures would cause the eyes \nand attention to move back to the point where integration \ndifficulty was initially detected, p\nN, was set equal to 0 \nfor clause- final words and 0.59 for all other words. This \nassumption—that p\nN \u0015 0 for clause-final words—meant \nthat more of the regressions resulting from integration dif-\n14    R EICHLE, WARREN, AND MCCONNELL\net al. (1998) corpus sentences as frames. The target nouns \n(word n) and the words immediately before (word n\u00121) \nand after (word n\u00111) these words were then embedded \nwithin these frames in exactly the same manner as in the \nprevious simulation. Because the cloze predictabilities of \nthese critical words were unknown, but the majority of \nthe words before and after the critical nouns were func-\ntion words, the predictabilities of words n\u00121, n, and n\u00111 \nwere set equal to 0.5, 0, and 0.5, respectively. As with the \nprior simulation, the qualitative pattern of the simulation \nresults was not dependent on these assumptions about \npredictability.\nOur specific assumptions about postlexical processing \nwere as follows: First, the overall base-rate of integration \ndifficulty was made to be nonzero by setting the integra-\ntion parameters to t(I) \u0015 25 msec and p\nF \u0015 0.13, for all \nnontarget words. The effects of target-word possibility \nand plausibility were then instantiated by increasing the \nintegration time for target words to t(I) \u0015 34 msec, and \nincreasing the probability of rapid integration failure for \nthese words to a degree concordant with the severity of \nthe possibility–plausibility violation: (1) for possible– \nplausible target words, p\nF \u0015 0.13 (i.e., the base-rate value); \n(2) for possible–implausible target words, pF \u0015 0.31; and \n(3) for impossible–implausible target words, pF \u0015 0.41. \nThe probability of regressing back to the source of inte-\ngration difficulty was set equal to p\nN \u0015 0.21 for all words. \nWith this value of pN, most interword regressions were di-\nrected back to locations before the point at which integra-\ntion difficulty was detected. The results of this simulation \nare shown in Table 3.\nAs Table 3 shows, the model was able to simulate the \ncorrect pattern of results. In the possible–implausible con-\ndition, the violation of plausibility showed up relatively \nlate, inflating gaze durations and total viewing times, \nbut only modestly increasing (by 4 msec) the mean first-\n fixation durations. This type of violation also resulted in \nmore regressions out of the critical nouns, consistent with \nwhat was observed in Warren and McConnell (2007). In \nthe impossible–implausible condition, the violation of \npossibility had a more rapid effect, inflating the durations \nof all of the fixation measures, and again increasing the \nnumber of regressions out of the critical nouns. These pat-\nterns are also consistent with what was observed, and are \nimportant for at least two reasons: First, the fact that the \nmodel was able to account for the basic pattern of results \nlations of the semantic constraints a predicate places on \nits argument) influence readers’ eye movements (Warren \n& McConnell, 2007).\nIn the experiment, we tested three conditions defined \nby whether the situation described in the sentence was \n(1) possible and plausible; (2) possible but implausible; \nor (3) impossible, due to a selectional restriction violation, \nand implausible. Example sentences for each of the three \nconditions follow:\n1. Possible–plausible: “The man used a strainer to drain \nthe thin spaghetti. . . .”\n2. Possible–implausible: “The man used a blow-dryer \nto dry the thin spaghetti. . . .”\n3. Impossible–implausible: “The man used a photo to \nblackmail the thin spaghetti. . . .”\nTable 3 shows the key results of the Warren and Mc-\nConnell (2007) experiment. The table shows four depen-\ndent measures on the target nouns, the first position where \nviolations are evident (spaghetti, in the example sentences \nabove). As the table indicates, the effect of implausibility, \nas evidenced by the comparison between the possible– \nimplausible condition and the possible–plausible condi-\ntion, did not appear in first-fixation durations, but was \nevident in gaze duration and total viewing time. The prob-\nability of making a regression out of the critical noun was \nalso inflated in the possible–implausible condition. This \npattern of results suggests that readers detect implausibil-\nity relatively late, perhaps only when attempting to update \ntheir discourse model.\nThis pattern contrasts with the one associated with vio-\nlations of possibility, in which effects appeared very early. \nComparing the two implausible conditions, it is clear that \npossibility violations lengthened the duration of the first \nfixation on the target nouns. This suggests that such viola-\ntions are detected very early, affecting the decision about \nwhen to move the eyes off the nouns. Within the framework \nof previous versions of the E-Z Reader model, this result \nwould seemingly necessitate that an extremely strong vio-\nlation of the semantic fit of a word with its context can \nslow the first stage of lexical processing, L\n1, on that word. \nHowever, in the context of our present assumptions, this \nresult can be explained by assuming that postlexical in-\ntegration is more likely to fail on the target noun in the \nimpossible than in the possible conditions.\nTo simulate the three conditions of the Warren and Mc-\nConnell (2007) experiment, we again used the Schilling \nTable 3 \nMean Observed (Warren & McConnell, 2007) and Simulated (E-Z Reader 10) Effects of Plausibility \nand Selectional Restriction Violations on Target Words, in Milliseconds\n Observed Simulated\nDependent P ossible– P ossible– Impossible– P ossible– P ossible– Impossible–\nMeasure  Plausible  Implausible  Implausible  Plausible  Implausible  Implausible\nFirst-fixation duration 259 260 273 261 265 270\nGaze duration 308 325 322 316 335 345\nTotal viewing time 360 402 433 359 402 422\nProbability regression out .079 .108 .111 .073 .141 .176\nNote—For nontarget words, t(I) \u0015 25 msec; pF \u0015 0.13; pN \u0015 0.21.

The second reason for including only \na subset of the conditions is that the disambiguating re-\ngion for the minimal attachment sentences occurred at the \nvery ends of the sentences. Because lexical processing \nof the sentence-final words always ends abruptly in the \nmodel, the simulated eye-movement measures on these \nwords are normally excluded from our analyses. We there-\nfore decided to direct our efforts toward explaining the \npatterns of results that were observed with the short vari-\nants of the Frazier and Rayner sentences in three of their \nconditions—the relatively easy-to-process late- closure \nsentences, the more difficult-to-process early closure sen-\ntences, and the nonminimal-attachment sentences.\nTo simulate these results, the overall base-rate of inte-\ngration difficulty was made to be nonzero by setting the \nintegration parameters to t(I) \u0015 25 msec and p\nF \u0015 0.11 \nfor all nondisambiguating words. The difficulty that was \nassumed to arise with the postlexical processing of the \ndisambiguating words was then instantiated by increasing \nthe integration time for disambiguating words to t(I) \u0015 \n66 msec, and increasing the probability of rapid integra-\ntion failure for these words to p\nF \u0015 0.7 for the easier-\nto-process late-closure sentences and to pF \u0015 1 for the \nmore difficult-to-process early-closure and nonminimal-\n attachment sentences. Finally, the probability of regress-\ning back to the source of integration difficulty (i.e., the \nword where the difficulty associated with postlexical pro-\ncessing was assumed to be first noticed by the reader) was \nset equal to p\nN \u0015 0.11 for all words.\nAs Table 4 shows, the model can capture the key ob-\nserved results: The durations of the first fixation in the \ndisambiguating region is longer than the last fixation du-\nration in the ambiguous region, there are a large number \nof interword regressions back to the ambiguous region, \nand both of these trends are much more pronounced for \nthe two difficult conditions (early closure and nonmini-\nmal attachment) than for the easy condition (late closure). \nThe model tends to underpredict both the absolute dura-\ntions of the fixations and the relative differences between \nthat were observed in the Warren and McConnell experi-\nment suggests that the model’ s assumptions about postlex-\nical processing are well founded and broadly applicable. \nSecond, the simulation demonstrates how problems with \npostlexical processing, if they are detected rapidly enough, \ncan affect even the earliest eye-movement measures on the \nword that is being processed. In our final simulation, we \nwill demonstrate that the model can capture syntactic inte-\ngration effects, as well as semantic ones, by simulating the \nresults of Frazier and Rayner’ s (1982) classic experiment \ninvolving garden path sentences.\nFrazier and Rayner (1982) provided evidence for the \ngarden path theory of syntactic parsing by investigating \nreaders’ eye movements to temporarily ambiguous sen-\ntences that either did or did not violate the principles of \nminimal attachment and late closure. Table 4 shows two \nkey results for a subset of the Frazier and Rayner condi-\ntions. The first of these results was that in the conditions \ninvolving integration difficulty (i.e., the early closure \nand nonminimal attachment sentences), the duration of \nthe first fixation in the disambiguating region was lon-\nger than the duration of the last fixation in the ambiguous \nregion. This indicates that disambiguating information \nbecomes available to the reader very rapidly. The second \nkey result was that there were many interword regressions \nfrom the disambiguating region back to the ambiguous \nregion (which was the immediately preceding region), and \nthis trend was more pronounced for the more- difficult-\nto-process sentences. We hypothesized that an explana-\ntion of these results would require both a slowing down \nin postlexical processing and the occasional detection of \npostlexical processing difficulty.\nOur simulation of the Frazier and Rayner (1982) experi-\nments involved only a subset of their conditions—those in-\nvolving the short variants of the sentences, and sentences \ninvolving late closure, early closure, and nonminimal at-\ntachment. The long variants of the sentences and the sen-\ntences involving minimal attachment were not simulated \nfor two pragmatic reasons: First, the results that were ob-\nserved with the longer sentences were qualitatively simi-\nlar to those observed with the short sentences, but were \nTable 4 \nMean Observed (Frazier & Rayner, 1982) and Simulated (E-Z Reader 10) Fixation Durations, in \nMilliseconds, Immediately Prior to and After Fixating  \nthe Disambiguating Region for Three Sentence Types\n Observed Simulated\nLast Prob.

For example, one could argue that postlexical pro-\ncessing interacts with lexical processing much more rapidly \nand directly, perhaps with both types of processing provid-\ning a set of soft constraints on the final representation for \na sentence (MacDonald, Pearlmutter, & Seidenberg, 1994; \nMcRae, Spivey-Knowlton, & Tanenhaus, 1998; Tabor, Ju-\nliano, & Tanenhaus, 1997). Although our simulations do \nnot preclude such a possibility, they do indicate that a small \nset of simple assumptions can explain a variety of impor-\ntant findings related to the effects of postlexical processing \non eye movements during reading. We therefore contend \nthat our approach has two important advantages over these \nother possible approaches: The first is that by implement-\ning our assumptions about postlexical processing within \nthe more general framework of a model of eye-movement \ncontrol, we are able to make direct predictions about \nthe patterns of eye movements that are observed in eye-\nmovement experiments. That is to say, our model makes \npredictions about the actual time (in milliseconds) that is \nrequired for processing real linguistic units (e.g., words), \nrather than making predictions about, for example, the \nnumber of processing cycles required for processing large, \nmultiword sentence regions (McRae et al., 1998; Spivey & \nTanenhaus, 1998; Tabor et al., 1997). The second advan-\ntage of our approach is its conceptual transparency: Each \ncomponent in our model is described by a distinct process-\ning module (Fodor, 1983) whose operating characteristics \ncan, in principle, be studied and described independently \nof the other components.\n5 The alternative approaches have \ntended to be much more interactive in nature, making the \ninner workings of the models more opaque and, therefore, \nless useful as heuristic devices for thinking about what \nhappens in the minds of readers or for making predictions \nabout the outcomes of experiments (for an in-depth discus-\nsion of these issues, see Rayner et al., 2003).\nOne could argue that this comparison is unfair, because \nprevious attempts to model the cognitive processes neces-\nsary for readers to understand sentences have focused on \nexplaining the processes and representations underlying \nlanguage processing, rather than investigating how this \nprocessing is related to the systems that are responsible for \nword identification, attention, and eye-movement control. \nWe acknowledge this; also note that we are not suggesting \nthat these alternative attempts to model sentence process-\ning have not been useful. The main point we are trying \nto make is more modest—that our understanding of both \nsentence processing and eye-movement control might \nbenefit from considering how these two areas of inquiry \nmutually constrain each other. This position is congruent \nwith Newell’ s (1990) argument about the usefulness of \ndeveloping cognitive architectures over developing single, \ntask-specific models. We see our model as being akin to \nattempts to describe the cognitive architecture in that, by \nmodeling the task of reading, we are trying to formally \ndescribe “very many of the most intricate workings of the \nhuman mind” (Huey, 1908, p. 6). With the inclusion of a \nstage of postlexical language processing, our model pro-\nvides the rough outlines of the cognitive architecture that \nis necessary for the task of reading.\nthe two fixation durations of interest, but we contend that \nneither of these shortcomings is fatal. One reason for our \nconviction here is that the simulations were completed \nusing the standard (default) parameter values that were \nused in all of the preceding simulations. Because the Fra-\nzier and Rayner (1982) experiment involved different ma-\nterials and different participants, our approach of using \nthe standard parameter values was very conservative. We \nwould therefore argue that given these constraints, the \nrelatively close correspondence between the observed \nand the simulated results is somewhat remarkable. The \nsecond reason for our conviction is related to the first: \nThe correspondence between the observed and simulated \nvalues can be improved by adjusting the model’ s parame-\nters. This is demonstrated in Table 4; the simulated values \nthat are shown in parentheses were obtained by increas-\ning the amount of additional time required for program-\nming regressive saccades from 30 msec (the value used \nin all of the other simulations reported in this article) to \n60 msec. As Table 4 shows, the adjustment of this single \nparameter is sufficient to increase both the absolute du-\nrations of the fixations and the size of the differences \nbetween the pre- and post disambiguating fixations. With \nthis final demonstration, we now turn to a discussion of \nour model and what it indicates about the relationship \nbetween postlexical processing and other influences on \neye movements during reading.\nDISCUSSION\nThe simulations reported in this article are important \nbecause they show how, within the framework of a com-\nputational model of eye-movement control, the systems \nresponsible for higher level, postlexical language pro-\ncessing might interact with those responsible for iden-\ntifying words, focusing and shifting attention, and pro-\ngramming and executing saccades, in order to produce \nthe patterns of eye movements observed during reading. \nAlthough one could quibble with any of our specific as-\nsumptions about the nature of these interactions, we con-\ntend that our demonstration provides an existence proof \nthat postlexical processing can lag behind ongoing lexi-\ncal processing, often generating no discernable effects \non the progression of the eyes through the text, but that \ndifficulty associated with postlexical processing will oc-\ncasionally manifest very rapidly in the form of pauses \nand/or regressions back to the location where processing \ndifficulty was first encountered. Our assumptions stipu-\nlate that such difficulty can arise whenever the postlexi-\ncal processing of a word fails to complete in a timely \nmanner (i.e., before the next word has been identified) \nor whenever it results in a severe syntactic or semantic \nviolation (Frazier & Rayner, 1982; Warren & McConnell, \n2007). Our assumptions also stipulate that the availability \nof one important source of information that is used to \nidentify words—the degree to which a word is predicted \nin its sentential context—is contingent on the successful \ncompletion of postlexical processing.\nOf course, it is possible that postlexical processing in-\nteracts with lexical processing or affects the forward move-\nUSING E-Z READER TO MODEL LANGUAGE PROCESSING EFFECTS    1 7\ndistance regressions. As we have already mentioned, if one \ncould imagine the replacement of our simple assumptions \nabout integration and regression by a detailed theory of \nlanguage processing, how language processing fails, and \nthe specific types of repair processes that are used to over-\ncome such failures, then one might hope to have a detailed \naccount of both long- and short-distance regressions. Bar-\nring this, our assumptions are capable of explaining only \nwhen regressions occur and—to a much more limited \ndegree—whether the regressions will be directed back to \nthe location where integration difficulty is first noticed by \nthe reader (i.e., the word at which integration fails), or to \nearlier locations in the sentence (i.e., the word immediately \nbefore the source of integration difficulty).\nAnother important issue having to do with regressions \nconcerns why they occur. If one accepts the assertion \n(Vitu, 2005; Vitu & McConkie, 2000) that all interword \nregressive saccades are due to oculomotor error, difficulty \nassociated with the identification of words, or difficulty \nassociated with postlexical language processing, then it \nis interesting that the two most fully developed models of \neye movements, E-Z Reader and SWIFT (Engbert et al., \n2005), make very different assumptions about the causes \nof regressions. In E-Z Reader, the majority of regressions \nare due to difficulty with postlexical processing, with \nonly a very small minority (typically less than 1%) of ad-\nditional regressions being due to oculomotor error, and \nno regressions being due to lexical processing difficulty \nper se. In contrast, in the SWIFT model, the majority of \nregressions are due to difficulty with lexical processing, \nwith some smaller percentage being due to oculomotor \nerror and none being due to postlexical processing. Given \nthese differences, one could ask whether either or both \nmodels would overpredict the absolute number of regres-\nsions if each one included all three sources of regressions. \nFor example, would the E-Z Reader model predict too \nmany regressions if it assumed that problems with lexical \nprocessing could generate regressions? We would argue \nthat because word identification problems are likely to \nmanifest or be detected during postlexical integration \n(e.g., when the meaning of a misperceived word cannot be \nintegrated into the overall meaning of the sentence; Pol-\nlatsek et al., 2008), the failure to include regressions that \nare due to difficulty associated with word identification \nis less problematic than the failure to include regressions \nthat are due to integration difficulty. However, it is clear \nthat further research will be needed to determine the pre-\ncise reasons why interword regressions occur during read-\ning. This future work is likely to benefit from the formu-\nlation of hypotheses about regressions (and other effects \nrelated to language processing) within the frameworks of \ncomputational models.\nAnother implication of our simulations also has to do \nwith the specific assumptions of E-Z Reader versus those \nof SWIFT (Engbert et al., 2005) regarding the relative \ntime course of lexical versus postlexical processing. Ac-\ncording to the E-Z Reader model, words are (on average) \nidentified after 150–250 msec of processing, whereas the \nminimal postlexical processing that is necessary for inte-\nThe points that we have attempted to make thus far have \nbeen quite general, in the sense that not one of them is \nspecific to the E-Z Reader model and might thus apply \nequally well to other models of eye-movement control \n(e.g., SWIFT; Engbert et al., 2005). That is not to say that \nthe simulations reported in this article have no immedi-\nate implications for either the E-Z Reader model or the \non going debate about whether E-Z Reader or some other \nmodel more accurately describes the perceptual, cogni-\ntive, and motor processes that guide eye movements dur-\ning reading. We will now discuss a few of these more spe-\ncific implications.\nFirst, our new assumptions about attention and postlexi-\ncal integration are important, because they demonstrate \nthat the inclusion of these processes does not prevent the \nmodel from explaining the types of data that it was de-\nsigned to explain. This point is not trivial because of the \ncriticism of previous versions of the model (Inhoff et al., \n2006; Radach et al., 2003; Radach et al., 2007), but be-\ncause the time required to shift attention from one word \nto the next was assumed to be instantaneous. Similarly, \nthe model has been criticized (Liversedge & White, 2003; \nMurray, 2003; Perea & Carreiras, 2003; Raney, 2003) be-\ncause it was viewed as making no provisions for explaining \nhow the processing of higher level language affects and is \naffected by lexical processing and eye-movement control. \nThe simulations reported in this article address these criti-\ncisms and furthermore indicate that relatively simple as-\nsumptions about attention and postlexical processing allow \nthe model to explain several findings that have heretofore \nbeen ignored by models of eye-movement control during \nreading. This point is important because, until now, the \ndebate about which is the “best” model of eye-movement \ncontrol has been focused largely on which model provides \nthe most accurate or comprehensive account of relatively \nlow-level variables (e.g., fixation landing- site distribu-\ntions; Reilly & O’Regan, 1998) and has largely ignored \nthe equally important effects of the types of higher level \nvariables (e.g., clause boundaries; Rayner et al., 2000) that \nwere examined in the present article. We predict that con-\nsideration of these higher level variables will prove to be \nimportant diagnostic criteria for evaluating future models \nof eye-movement control in reading.\nA second, related implication of our simulations has to \ndo with the debate about the etiology of regressive sac-\ncades. In the current literature, there is some debate about \nthe degree to which readers can accurately direct their gaze \nback to the source of processing difficulty; although there \nis some evidence suggesting that readers can accurately \nmake long-distance regressions (Frazier & Rayner, 1982; \nKennedy et al., 2003; Kennedy & Murray, 1987), there is \nalso some evidence suggesting that readers initially make \nshort, one-word or two-word regressions and then move \ntheir eyes back further, as necessary (Apel et al., 2007; \nMitchell, Shen, Green, & Hodgson, 2008).\nAlthough our assumptions regarding regressions are ag-\nnostic with respect to which of these two characterizations \nof regressions is more correct, the model is clearly not \nsufficient to provide any type of detailed account of long-\n18    R EICHLE, WARREN, AND MCCONNELL\n& Waters, 1999)? We prefer to remain agnostic about this \nimportant issue, but we acknowledge that future work may \nforce us to adopt one position or the other.\nIn closing, let us briefly address a potential critique of the \nnew assumptions of this model—the fact that they increase \nthe model’ s complexity. This is true, but it is important to \nbear in mind that this added complexity is fairly minimal, \nconsidering that the new model’ s assumptions provide a \nframework for thinking about a theoretical domain that \nhas been largely ignored by models of eye-movement con-\ntrol (see Reichle et al., 2003) and that has only been su-\nperficially addressed by language-processing models that \nmake predictions about reading behavior (McRae et al., \n1998; Spivey & Tanenhaus, 1998; Tabor et al., 1997). Al-\nthough one might argue that the added complexity reduces \nthe model’ s conceptual transparency, making it less useful \nfor generating and evaluating empirical predictions, it is \nimportant to bear in mind that conceptual transparency is \nrelative, and that our model, with its new assumptions, is \nstill simpler than many of the alternative models of eye-\nmovement control (e.g., SWIFT; Engbert et al., 2005) that \nsay little or nothing about higher level language process-\ning, and simpler than the constraint- satisfaction models \nof language processing (McRae et al., 1998; Spivey & \nTanenhaus, 1998; Tabor et al., 1997) that are less trans-\nparent, by virtue of their highly interactive nature. Thus, \nalthough we acknowledge that E-Z Reader 10 may not be \nas simple as its predecessors, we suspect that its enhanced \ntheoretical scope and its relative conceptual transparency \nwill make it—like its predecessors (see, e.g., Reingold \n& Rayner, 2006)—a useful heuristic for generating new \nresearch and enhancing our understanding of the cognitive \nprocesses that operate during reading.\nAUTHOR NOTE\nPreliminary parts of this work were presented at the 2008 CUNY Con-\nference on Human Sentence Processing in Chapel Hill, NC.

Both \nof these assumptions contrast with those of the SWIFT \nmodel, where an autonomous random timer provides the \nsignal to move the eyes forward, with processing diffi-\nculty of the previously fixated word occasionally inter-\nvening to inhibit or delay the onset of the saccades that \notherwise move the eyes to new viewing locations. Ac-\ncording to SWIFT, this saccade inhibition occurs with \nsome delay (after 376 msec, on average). Note that both \nmodels predict that linguistic processes can inhibit the \nforward progression of the eyes; but in SWIFT, this is ac-\ncomplished by lexical processing, whereas in E-Z Reader, \nit is accomplished by postlexical processing. This com-\nparison raises the possibility that the relatively late inhibi-\ntory effects that SWIFT attributes to difficulty with lexi-\ncal processing are more accurately described as reflecting \npost lexical processing. Although evidence for lagged ef-\nfects of lexical processing has been reported in analyses \nof eye-movement corpora (Kliegl, Nuthmann, & Engbert, \n2006), these results are open to multiple interpretations \n(Rayner, Pollatsek, Drieghe, Slattery, & Reichle, 2006), \nmaking future work (perhaps using brain-imaging meth-\nods; see, e.g., Reichle, Tokowicz, Liu, & Perfetti, 2008) \nimportant for resolving this issue.\nAnother implication of our simulations is related to a \ncontrast between the assumptions of E-Z Reader versus \nthose of SWIFT, regarding how attention is allocated dur-\ning reading. Within all versions of E-Z Reader, attention is \nallocated in a serial manner, with the “spotlight” of atten-\ntion corresponding to ongoing lexical processing. Given \nthat postlexical and lexical processing can simultaneously \nproceed on adjacent words in the current version of the \nmodel, the question arises about whether this necessitates \nsome degree of parallelism in attention allocation, making \nthe model’ s assumptions about attention more similar to \nthose of SWIFT. If higher level language processes require \nattention, some limited parallelism would be necessary. \nHowever, there is still strict seriality within levels of repre-\nsentation in the current version of E-Z Reader, with lexical \nprocessing, as well as postlexical processing, proceeding \none word at a time. This means that E-Z Reader never ac-\ncesses the meanings of words out of order. In the SWIFT \nmodel, which allows parallel lexical processing, word n\u00111 \ncan be identified before word n, necessitating either that \nwords be integrated into a higher level representation out \nof order or that they be maintained in some type of buffer \nuntil the meanings of earlier words become available. Re-\nlated to this question of attention allocation is the issue of \nhow to characterize the attention and/or memory resources \nused during lexical and postlexical processing; for exam-\nple, is there one pool of resources divided between the two, \nor are there separate resources for each (see, e.g., Caplan \nUSING E-Z READER TO MODEL LANGUAGE PROCESSING EFFECTS    1 9\nJust, M.

In eye-movement experiments like the ones that are simulated in the \npresent article, each degree of visual angle typically corresponds to three \nto four character spaces.\n3. This method has been used successfully on several occasions (Pol-\nlatsek et al., 2003, 2006b, 2006c; Rayner et al., 2004; Rayner, Reichle, \net al., 2006; Reichle et al., 2007) in lieu of completing simulations using \nthe actual sentence materials that were used in the various experiments. \nDoing the latter is prohibitively expensive, because it is first necessary to \ndetermine the frequency, length, and predictability of all of the words in \nthe sentence corpus. Although frequencies and lengths are easy to deter-\nmine, predictabilities can be determined only by completing a separate \nexperiment to collect cloze-task probability norms. After this information \nhas been obtained, it is then necessary to determine the model’ s best fit-\nting parameter values. This is also a costly process: First, it is necessary \nto compute the mean first-fixation and gaze durations for each word in \nthe corpus, as well as the mean probabilities of making one and two fixa-\ntions on each word. These values are then used to calculate an index of \nthe model’ s overall performance in simulating the observed data (e.g., the \nroot-mean-square deviation, or RMSD, between the observed and pre-\ndicted means), which can then be used in conjunction with a parameter-\n searching heuristic to find the set of parameters that allows the model to \nmost accurately simulate the observed data. For a detailed explanation of \nhow this is done, see the appendix of Reichle et al. (1998).\n4. To provide some basis for comparison, the previously published ver-\nsions of E-Z Reader have had RSMDs ranging from 0.088 (Reichle et al., \n2003) to 0.218 (Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 1999). Generally speak-\ning, RMSD values lower than 0.5 provide fits that are reasonably close to \nthe observed means (see, e.g., Sparrow, Miellet, & Coello, 2003).\n5. We readily acknowledge that we are taking a hard theoretical stance \nby adopting this type of modular (Fodor, 1983) architecture, and that \nthis position may be incorrect. We would nevertheless argue that this \nposition is tremendously useful, because it makes the model architec-\nture more conceptually transparent and computationally tractable than \nthe architectures of highly interactive (e.g., connectionist soft-constraint \nsatisfaction; MacDonald et al., 1994) models.\n(Manuscript received September 5, 2007; \nrevision accepted for publication July 15, 2008.)\nlexical and structural constraints in sentence processing.

Although there are more sophisticated ways of operationally defin-\ning the degree to which a word’ s meaning is constrained by or predicted \nfrom its sentence context (e.g., latent semantic analysis; Landauer, Foltz, \n& Laham, 1998), we used the cloze probabilities because this allowed us \nto directly compare the simulations reported in this article with earlier \nones (which used the same cloze-task norms).",
