    "abstract": "In the scope of a Dutch programme to reinforce the working conditions policy on hazardous substances, an internet-based tool was developed to help small- and medium-sized companies to handle hazardous substances with more care. The heart of this tool, called the Stoffenmanager, is a risk banding scheme. It combines a hazard banding scheme similar to that of COSHH Essentials and an exposure banding scheme based on an exposure model originally presented by Cherrie et al. (1996) and further developed by Cherrie and Schneider (1999). The exposure model has been modified to allow non-expert users to understand and use the model. Exposure scores are calculated based on categorization of determinants of emission, transmission and immission. These exposure scores are assigned to exposure bands. The comparison of exposure bands and hazard bands leads to a risk band or priority band. Following the evaluation of the priority of tasks done with products, generic exposure control measures can be evaluated for their possibility to lower the risks. Relevant control measures can be put into an action plan and into workplace instruction cards. The tool has several other functionalities regarding registration and storage of products. The exposure model in the Stoffenmanager leads to exposure scores. These have been compared with measured exposure levels. The exposure scores correlated well with measured exposure levels. The development of the Stoffenmanager has facilitated a whole range of further developments of useful tools for small- and medium-sized enterprises.",
