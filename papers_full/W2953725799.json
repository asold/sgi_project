On\nthe one hand, these sequences present a real challenge in the process of genome analysis and annotation. On\nthe other hand, they are very interesting biological subjects involved in many cellular processes. Here we\npresent an overview of transposable elements biodiversity, and we discuss different approaches to transpo-\nsable elements detection and analyses.\nKey words Transposable elements, Transposons, Mobile elements, Repetitive elements, Genome\nanalysis, Genome evolution\n1 Introduction\nMost eukaryotic genomes contain large numbers of repetitive\nsequences. This phenomenon was described by Waring and Britten\na half century ago using reassociation studies [1, 2]. It turned out\nthat most of these repetitive sequences originated in transposable\nelements (TEs) [3], though the repetitive fraction of a genome\nvaries signiﬁcantly between different organisms, from 12% inCae-\nnorhabditis elegans[4] to 50% in mammals [3], and more than 80%\nin some plants [5]. With such large contributions to genome\nsequences, it is not surprising that TEs have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence\non the genome organization and evolution. Although much prog-\nress has been achieved in understanding the role TEs play in a host\ngenome, we are still far from the comprehensive picture of the\ndelicate evolutionary interplay between a host genome and the\ninvaders. They also pose various challenges to the genomic com-\nmunity, including aspects related to their detection and classiﬁca-\ntion, genome assembly and annotation, genome comparisons, and\nmapping of genomic variants. They also pose various challenges to\nthe genomic community, including aspects related to their detec-\ntion and classiﬁcation, genome assembly and annotation, genome\nMaria Anisimova (ed.), Evolutionary Genomics: Statistical and Computational Methods, Methods in Molecular Biology, vol. 1910,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9074-0_6, © The Author(s) 2019\n177\ncomparisons, and mapping of genomic variants. Here we present an\noverview of TE diversity and discuss major techniques used in their\nanalyses.\n2 Discovery of Mobile Elements\nTransposable elements were discovered by Barbara McClintock\nduring experiments conducted in 1944 on maize. Since they\nappeared to inﬂuence phenotypic traits, she named them\ncontrolling elements. However, her discovery was met with less\nthan enthusiastic reception by the genetic community. Her presen-\ntation at the 1951 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium was not under-\nstood and at least not very well received [6]. She had no better luck\nwith her follow-up publications [7–9] and after several years of\nfrustration decided not to publish on the subject for the next two\ndecades. Not for the ﬁrst time in the history of science, an unap-\npreciated discovery was brought back to life after some other\ndiscovery has been made. In this case it was the discovery of\ninsertion sequences (IS) in bacteria by Szybalski group in the early\n1970s [10]. In the original paper they wrote: “Genetic elements\nwere found in higher organisms which appear to be readily trans-\nposed from one to another site in the genome. Such elements,\nidentiﬁable by their controlling functions, were described by\nMcClintock in maize. It is possible that they might be somehow\nanalogous to the presently studied IS insertions” [10]. The impor-\ntance of McClintock’s original work was eventually appreciated by\nthe genetic community with numerous awards, including 14 hon-\norary doctoral degrees and a Nobel Prize in 1983 “for her discovery\nof mobile genetic elements” ( http://nobelprize.org/nobel_\nprizes/medicine/laureates/1983/).\nCoincidently, at the same time as Szybalski “rediscovered” TEs,\nSusumu Ohno popularized the termjunk DNA that inﬂuenced\ngenomic ﬁeld for decades [11], although the term itself was used\nalready before [12, 13].1 Ohno referred to the so-called noncoding\nsequences or, to be more precise, to any piece of DNA that do not\ncode for a protein, which included all genomic pieces originated in\ntransposons. The unfavorable picture of transposable and trans-\nposed elements started to change in early 1990s when some\nresearchers noticed evolutionary value of these elements\n[14, 15]. With the wheel of fortune turning full circle and advances\nof genome sciences, TE research is again focused on the role of\nmobile elements played in the evolution of gene regulation\n[16–23].\n1 The historical background of the “junk DNA” term was recently discussed by Dan Graur in his excellent blog\nhttp://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/64504735261/the-origin-of-the-term-junk-dna-a-historical\n178 Wojciech Makałowski et al.\n3 Transposons Classiﬁcation\n3.1 Insertion\nSequences and Other\nBacterial Transposons\nThe bacterial genome is composed of a core genomic backbone\ndecorated with a variety of multifarious functional elements. These\ninclude mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such asbacteriophages,\nconjugative transposons, integrons, unit transposons, composite trans-\nposons, andinsertion sequences(IS). Here we elaborate upon the last\nclass of these elements as they are most widely found and\ndescribed [24].\nThe ISs were identiﬁed during studies of model genetic systems\nby virtue of their capacity to generate mutations as a result of their\ntranslocation [10]. In-depth studies in antibiotic resistance and\ntransmissible plasmids revealed an important role for these mobile\nelements in formation of resistance genes and promoting gene\ncapture. In particular, it was observed that several different ele-\nments were often clustered in “islands” within plasmid genomes\nand served to promote plasmid integration and excision.\nAlthough these elements sometimes generate beneﬁcial muta-\ntions, they may be considered genomic parasites as ISs code only for\nthe enzyme required for their own transposition [24]. While an IS\nelement occupies a chromosomal location, it is inherited along with\nits host’s native genes, so its ﬁtness is closely tied to that of its host.\nConsequently, ISs causing deleterious mutations that disrupt a\ngenomic mode or function are quickly eliminated from the popula-\ntion. However, intergenically placed ISs have a higher chance to be\nﬁxed in the population as they are likely neutral regarding popula-\ntion’s ﬁtness [25].\nISs are generally compact (Fig.1). They usually carry no other\nfunctions than those involved in their mobility. These elements\ncontain recombinationally active sequences which deﬁne the\nboundary of the element, together with Tpase, an enzyme, which\nprocesses these ends and whose gene usually encompasses the\nentire length of the element [26]. Majority of ISs exhibit short\nterminal inverted-repeat sequences (IR) of length 10–40 bp. Sev-\neral notable exceptions do exist, for example, the IS91, IS110, and\nIS200/605 families.\nThe IRs contain two functional domains [27]. One is involved\nin Tpase binding; the other cleaves and transfers strand-speciﬁc\nreactions resulting in transposition. IS promoters are often posi-\ntioned partially within the IR sequence upstream of theTpase gene.\nBinding sites for host-speciﬁc proteins are often located within\nproximity to the terminal IRs and play a role in modulating trans-\nposition activity or Tpase expression [28]. A general pattern for the\nfunctional organization of Tpases has emerged from the limited\nnumbers analyzed. The N-terminal region contains sequence-\nspeciﬁc DNA binding activities of the proteins while the catalytic\ndomain is often localized toward the C-terminal end [28].\nTransposable Elements: Classiﬁcation, Identiﬁcation, and Their Use ... 179\nAnother common feature of ISs is duplication of a target site\nthat results in short direct repeats (DRs) ﬂanking the IS [29]. The\nlength of the direct repeat varies from 2 to 14 base pairs and is a\nhallmark of a given element. Homologous recombination between\ntwo IS elements can result in each having two different DRs [30].\nISs have been classiﬁed on the basis of (1) similarities in genetic\norganization (arrangement of open reading frames); (2) marked\nidentities or similarities in their Tpases (common domains or\nmotifs); (3) similar features of their ends (terminal IRs); and\n(4) fate of the nucleotide sequence of their target sites (generation\nof a direct target duplication of determined length). Based on the\nabove rules, ISs are currently classiﬁed in 30 families (Table1)[ 31].\n3.2 Eukaryotic\nTransposable\nElements\nThe ﬁrst TE classiﬁcation system was proposed by Finnegan in\n1989 [32] and distinguished two classes of TEs characterized by\ntheir transposition intermediate: RNA (class I or retrotransposons)\nor DNA (class II or DNA transposons). The transposition mecha-\nnism of class I is commonly called “copy and paste” and that of class\nII, “cut and paste.” In 2007 Wicker et al. [33] proposed hierarchi-\ncal classiﬁcation based on TEs structural characteristics and mode of\nreplication (see Table 2 and Fig. 2). Below we present a brief\noverview of eukaryotic mobile elements that in general follows\nthis classiﬁcation.\n3.2.1 Class I: Mobile\nElements\nAs mentioned above, class I TEs transpose through an RNA inter-\nmediary. The RNA intermediate is transcribed from genomic DNA\nand then reverse-transcribed into DNA by a TE-encoded reverse\ntranscriptase (RT), followed by reintegration into a genome. Each\nreplication cycle produces one new copy, and as a result, class I\nelements are the major contributors to the repetitive fraction in\nlarge genomes. Retrotransposons are divided into ﬁve orders: LTR\nretrotransposons, DIRS-like elements, Penelope-like elements\n(PLEs), LINEs (long interspersed elements), and SINEs (short\ninterspersed elements). This scheme is based on the mechanistic\nfeatures, organization, and reverse transcriptase phylogeny of these\nretroelements. Accidentally, the retrotranscriptase coded by an\nautonomous TE can reverse-transcribe another RNA present in\nthe cell, e.g., mRNA, and produce a retrocopy of it, which in\nmost cases results in a pseudogene.\nThe LTR retrotransposons are characterized by the presence of\nlong terminal repeats (LTRs) ranging from several hundred to\nseveral thousand base pairs.

Unlike LTR retrotransposons, exogenous retroviruses con-\ntain an env gene, which encodes an envelope that facilitates their\nmigration to other cells. Some LTR retrotransposons may contain\nremnants of anenv gene, but their insertion capabilities are limited\nto the originating genome [35].

Interestingly, LTR\nretrotransposons target their reinsertion to speciﬁc genomic sites,\noften around genes, with putative important functional implica-\ntions for a host gene [35]. Lander et al. estimated that 450,000\nLTR copies make up about 8% of our genome [38]. LTR retro-\ntransposons inhabiting large genomes, such as maize, wheat, or\nbarley, can contain thousands of families. However, despite the\ndiversity, very few families comprise most of the repetitive fraction\nin these large genomes. Notable examples are Angela (wheat) [39],\nBARE1 (barley) [ 40], Opie (maize) [ 41], and Retrosor6\n(sorghum) [42].\nThe DIRS order clusters structurally diverged group of trans-\nposons that possess a tyrosine recombinase (YR) gene instead of an\nintegrase (INT) and do not form target site duplications (TSDs).\nTheir termini resemble either split direct repeats (SDR) or inverted\nrepeats. Such features indicate a different integration mechanism\nthan that of other class I mobile elements. DIRS were discovered in\nthe slime mold (Dictyostelium discoideum) genome in the early\n1980s [43], and they are present in all major phylogenetic lineages\nincluding vertebrates [44]. It has been showed that they are also\ncommon in hydrothermal vent organisms [45].\nAnother order, termedPenelope-like elements (PLE), has wide,\nthough patchy distribution from amoebae and fungi to vertebrates\nwith copy number up to thousands per genome [46]. Interestingly,\nno PLE sequences have been found in mammalian genomes, and\napparently they were lost from the genome of C. elegans\n[47]. Although PLEs with an intact ORF have been found in\nseveral genomes, includingCiona and Danio, the only transcrip-\ntionally active representative,Penelope, is known fromDrosophila\nvirilis. It causes the hybrid dysgenesis syndrome characterized by\nsimultaneous mobilization of several unrelated TE families in the\nprogeny of dysgenic crosses. It seems that Penelope invaded\nD. virilisquite recently, and its invasive potential was demonstrated\nin D. melanogaster[46]. PLEs harbor a single ORF that codes for a\nprotein containing reverse transcriptase (RT) and endonuclease\n(EN) domains. The PLE RT domain more closely resembles telo-\nmerase than the RT from LTRs or LINEs. The EN domain is\nrelated to GIY-YIG intron-encoded endonucleases. Some PLE\nmembers also have LTR-like sequences, which can be in a direct\nor an inverse orientation, and have a functional intron [46].\nLINEs [48, 49] do not have LTRs; however, they have a poly-A\ntail at the 30 end and are ﬂanked by the TSDs. They comprise about\n21% of the human genome and among them L1 with about\n850,000 copies is the most abundant and best described LINE\nfamily. L1 is the only LINE retroposon still active in the human\ngenome [50]. In the human genome, there are two other LINE-\nlike repeats, L2 and L3, distantly related to L1. A contrasting\n184 Wojciech Makałowski et al.\nsituation has been noticed in the malaria mosquitoAnopheles gam-\nbiae, where around 100 divergent LINE families compose only 3%\nof its genome [51]. LINEs in plants, e.g., Cin4 in maize and Ta11\nin Arabidopsis thaliana, seem rare as compared with LTR retro-\ntransposons. A full copy of mammalian L1 is about 6 kb long and\ncontains a PolII promoter and two ORFs. The ORF1 codes for a\nnon-sequence-speciﬁc RNA binding protein that contains zinc ﬁn-\nger, leucine zipper, and coiled-coil motifs. The ORF1p functions as\nchaperone for the L1 mRNA [52, 53]. The second ORF encodes\nan endonuclease, which makes a single-stranded nick in the geno-\nmic DNA, and a reverse transcriptase, which uses the nicked DNA\nto prime reverse transcription of LINE RNA from the 30 end.\nReverse transcription is often unﬁnished, leaving behind fragmen-\nted copies of LINE elements; hence most of the L1-derived repeats\nare short, with an average size of 900 bp. LINEs are part of the CR1\nclade, which has members in various metazoan species, including\nfruit ﬂy, mosquito, zebraﬁsh, pufferﬁsh, turtle, and chicken\n[54]. Because they encode their own retrotransposition machinery,\nLINE elements are regarded as autonomous retrotransposons.\nSINEs [48, 49] evolved from RNA genes, such as 7SL and\ntRNA genes. By deﬁnition, they are short, up to 1000 base pair\nlong. They do not encode their own retrotranscription machinery\nand are considered as nonautonomous elements and in most cases\nare mobilized by the L1 machinery [55]. The outstanding member\nof this class from the human genome is the Alu repeat, which\ncontains a cleavage site for theAluI restriction enzyme that gave\nits name [56]. With over a million copies in the human genome,\nAlu is probably the most successful transposon in the history of life.\nPrimate-speciﬁc Alu and its rodent relative B1 have limited phylo-\ngenetic distribution suggesting their relatively recent origins. The\nmammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs), by contrast, spread\nbefore eutherian radiation, and their copies can be found in differ-\nent mammalian groups including marsupials and monotremes\n[57]. SVA elements are unique primate elements due to their\ncomposite structure. They are named after their main components:\nSINE, VNTR (a variable number of tandem repeats), and Alu\n[58]. Usually, they contain the hallmarks of the retroposition, i.e.,\nthey are ﬂanked by TSDs and terminated by a poly(A) tail. It seems\nthat SVA elements are nonautonomous retrotransposons mobilized\nby L1 machinery, and they are thought to be transcribed by RNA\npolymerase II. SVAs are transpositionally active and are responsible\nfor some human diseases [59]. They originated less than 25 million\nyears ago, and they form the youngest retrotransposon family with\nabout 3000 copies in the human genome [58].\nRetro(pseudo)genes are a special group of retroposed\nsequences, which are products of reverse transcription of a spliced\n(mature) mRNA. Hence, their characteristic features are an absence\nTransposable Elements: Classiﬁcation, Identiﬁcation, and Their Use ... 185\nof promoter sequence and introns, the presence of ﬂanking direct\nrepeats, and a 30-end polyadenosine tract [60]. Processed pseudo-\ngenes, as sometimes retropseudogenes are called, have been gener-\nated in vitro at a low frequency in the human HeLa cells via mRNA\nfrom a reporter gene [60]. The source of the reverse transcription\nmachinery in humans and other vertebrates seems to be active L1\nelements [61]. However, not all retroposed messages have to end\nup as pseudogenes. About 20% of mammalian protein-encoding\ngenes lack introns in their ORFs [62]. It is conceivable that many\ngenes lacking introns arose by retroposition. Some genes are known\nto be retroposed more often than others. For instance, in the\nhuman genome there are over 2000 retropseudogenes of ribosomal\nproteins [63]. A genome-wide study showed that the human\ngenome harbors about 20,000 pseudogenes, 72% of which most\nlikely arose through retroposition [64]. Interestingly, the vast\nmajority (92%) of them are quite recent transpositions that\noccurred after primate/rodent divergence [64]. Some of the retro-\nposed genes may undergo quite complicated evolutionary paths.\nAn example could be the RNF13B retrogene, which replaced its\nown parental gene in the mammalian genomes. This retrocopy was\nduplicated in primates, and the evolution of this primate-speciﬁc\ncopy was accompanied by the exaptation of two TEs, Alu and L1,\nand intron gain via changing a part of coding sequence into an\nintron leading to the origin of a functional, primate-speciﬁc retro-\ngene with two splicing variants [65].\n3.2.2 Class II: Mobile\nElements\nClass II elements move by a conservative cut-and-paste mechanism;\nthe excision of the donor element is followed by its reinsertion\nelsewhere in the genome. DNA transposons are abundant in bacte-\nria, where they are called insertion sequences (see Subheading 3.1),\nbut are present in all phyla. Wicker et al. distinguished two sub-\nclasses of DNA transposons based on the number of DNA strands\nthat are cut during transposition [33].\nClassical “cut-and-paste” transposons belong to the subclass I,\nand they are classiﬁed as the TIR order. They are characterized by\nterminal inverted repeats (TIR) and encode a transposase that binds\nnear the inverted repeats and mediates mobility. This process is not\nusually a replicative one, unless the gap caused by excision is\nrepaired using the sister chromatid. When inserted at a new loca-\ntion, the transposon is ﬂanked by small gaps, which, when ﬁlled by\nhost enzymes, cause duplication of the sequence at the target site.\nThe length of these TSDs is characteristic for particular transpo-\nsons. Nine superfamilies belong to the TIR order, includingTc1-\nMariner, Merlin, Mutator, andPiggyBac. The second order Cryp-\nton consists of a single superfamily of the same name. Originally\nthought to be limited to fungi [66], now it is clear that they have a\nwide distribution, including animals and heterokonts [ 67]. A\n186 Wojciech Makałowski et al.\nheterogeneous, small, nonautonomous group of elements MITEs\nalso belong to the TIR order [68], which in some genomes ampli-\nﬁed to thousands of copies, e.g.,Stowaway in the rice genome [69],\nTourist in most bamboo genomes [70], orGalluhop in the chicken\ngenome [71].\nSubclass II includes two orders of TEs that, just as those from\nsubclass I, do not form RNA intermediates. However, unlike “clas-\nsical” DNA transposons, they replicate without double-strand\ncleavage. Helitrons replicate using a rolling-circle mechanism, and\ntheir insertion does not result in the target site duplication\n[72]. They encode tyrosine recombinase along with some other\nproteins. Helitrons were ﬁrst described in plants, but they are also\npresent in other phyla, including fungi and mammals\n[73, 74]. Mavericks are large transposons that have been found in\ndifferent eukaryotic lineages excluding plants [75]. They encode\nvarious numbers of proteins that include DNA polymerase B and an\nintegrase. Kapitonov and Jurka suggested that their life cycle\nincludes a single-strand excision, followed by extrachromosomal\nreplication and reintegration to a new location [76].\n4 Identiﬁcation of Transposable Elements\nWith the ever-growing number of sequenced genomes from differ-\nent branches of the tree of life, there are increasing TE research\nopportunities. There are several reasons why one would like to\nanalyze TEs and their “offsprings” left in a genome. First of all,\nthey are very interesting biological subjects to study genome struc-\nture, gene regulation, or genome evolution. In some cases, they\nalso make genome assembly and annotation quite challenging,\nespecially with the current NGS technology that generates reads\nshorter than TEs. Nevertheless, TEs should be and are worthy to\nstudy. However, it is not a simple task and requires different\napproaches depending on the level of analysis. We will walk through\nthese different levels starting with raw genome sequences without\nany annotation and discuss different methods and software used for\nTE analyses. In principle, we can imagine two scenarios: in the ﬁrst\none, genomic or transcriptome sequences are coming from a spe-\ncies for which there is already some information about the transpo-\nson repertoire, for instance, a related genome has been previously\ncharacterized or TEs have been studied before. In the second\nscenario, we have to deal with a completely unknown genome or\na genome for which little information exists with regard to TEs. In\nthe former case, one can apply a range of techniques used in\ncomparative genomics or try to search speciﬁc libraries of transpo-\nsons using the “homology search” approach. In the latter, which is\nbasically an approach to identify TEs de novo, ﬁrst we need to ﬁnd\nTransposable Elements: Classiﬁcation, Identiﬁcation, and Their Use ... 187\nany repeats in a genome and then attempt characterization and\nclassiﬁcation of newly identiﬁed repetitive sequences. In this\napproach, we will ﬁnd any repeats, not necessarily transposons.\nThere are many algorithms, and even more software, that can be\napplied in both approaches.\n4.1 De Novo\nApproaches to Finding\nRepetitive Elements\nThere are several steps involved in the de novo characterization of\ntransposons. First, we need to ﬁnd all the repeats in a genome, then\nbuild a consensus of each family of related sequences, and ﬁnally\nclassify detected sequences. For the ﬁrst step, three groups of\nalgorithms exist: the k-mer approach, sequence self-comparison,\nand periodicity analysis.\nIn the k-mer approach, sequences are scanned for overrepre-\nsentation of strings of certain length. The idea is that repeats that\nbelong to the same family are compositionally similar and share\nsome oligomers. If the repeats occur many times in a genome, then\nthose oligomers should be overrepresented. However, since repeats\nand transposons in particular are not perfect copies of a certain\nsequence, some mismatches must be allowed when oligo frequen-\ncies are calculated. The challenge is to determine optimal size of an\noligo (k-mer) and number of mismatches allowed. Most likely,\nthese parameters should be different for different types of transpo-\nsons, i.e., low versus high copy number, old versus young transpo-\nsons, and those from different classes and families. Several programs\nhave been developed based on thek-mer idea using a sufﬁx tree data\nstructure including REPuter [77, 78], Vmatch (Kurtz, unpub-\nlished; http://www.vmatch.de/), and Repeat-match\n[79, 80]. Another approach is to use ﬁxed lengthk-mers as seeds\nand extend those seeds to deﬁne repeat’s family as it was imple-\nmented in ReAS [ 81], RepeatScout [ 82], and Tallymer\n[83]. Another interesting algorithm can be found in the FORRe-\npeats software [84], which usesfactor oracledata structure [85]. It\nstarts with detection of exact oligomers in the analyzed sequences,\nfollowed by ﬁnding approximate repeats and their alignment.\nThe second group of programs developed for de novo detec-\ntion of repeated sequences is using self-comparison approach.\nRepeat Pattern Toolkit [86], RECON [87], PILER [88, 89], and\nBLASTER [90] belong to this group. The idea is to use one of the\nfast sequence similarity tools, e.g., BLAST [91], followed by clus-\ntering search results. The programs differ in the search engine for\nthe initial step, though most are using some of the BLAST algo-\nrithms, the clustering method, and heuristics of merging initial hits\ninto a prototype element. For instance, RECON [87], which was\ndeveloped for the repeat ﬁnding in unassembled sequence reads,\nstarts with an all-to-all comparison using WU-BLAST engine.\nThen, single-linkage clustering is applied to alignment results that\nis followed by construction of an undirected graph with overlap-\nping. The shortest sequence that contains connected images\n188 Wojciech Makałowski et al.\n(aligned subsequences) creates a prototype element. However, this\nprocedure might result in composite elements. To avoid this, all the\nimages are aligned to the prototype element to detect potential\nillegitimate mergers and split those at every point with a signiﬁcant\nnumber of image ends.\nPILER [88, 89] is using a different approach to ﬁnd initial\nclusters. Instead of BLAST, it uses PALS (pairwise alignment of\nlong sequences) for the initial alignment. PALS records only hit\npoints and uses banded search of the deﬁned maximum distance to\noptimize its performance. To further improve performance of the\nsystem, PILER uses different heuristics for different types of\nrepeats, i.e., satellites, pseudosatellites, terminal repeats, and inter-\nspersed repeats. Finally, a consensus sequence is generated from a\nmultiple sequence alignment of the deﬁned family members.\nDot matrix is a simple method to compare two biological\nsequences. The graphical output of such an analysis is called a dot-\nplot. Dotplots can be used to detect conserved domains, sequence\nrearrangements, RNA secondary structure, or repeated sequences. It\ncompares every residue in one sequence to every residue in the other\nsequence or to every residue of the same sequence in the self-\ncomparison mode. In the latter case, there will be a main diagonal\nline representing a perfect match and a number of short diagonal\nlines representing similar regions (red circles in Fig.3). Interestingly,\nsimple repeats appear as diamond shapes on a main diagonal line or\nshort vertical and horizontal lines outside the main diagonal line (red\nsquares in Fig.3). The method was introduced to biological analyses\nalmost a half century ago [92, 93]. However, the ﬁrst easy-to-use\nsoftware with a graphical interface, DOTTER, was developed much\nlater [94]. The major problem of this approach is the time required\nfor the dotplot calculation, which is of quadratic complexity. This\nproved to be prohibitive for comparison of the genome-size\nsequences. One of the solutions to this problem is using a word\nindex for the fast identiﬁcation of substrings. Gepard implements\nthe sufﬁx array data structure to improve the execution time [95]. It\nis written in Java, which makes it platform-independent. Gepard\nenables analyses of sequences at the mega-base level in the matter\nof seconds, and it takes about an hour to analyze the whole human\nchromosome I [95]. The example of the dotplot produced by the\nGepard is presented in Fig.3.\n4.2 Transposable\nElements\nDetermination in\nNGS Data\nWith constant improvement of sequencing technology associated\nwith decreasing sequencing cost, the number of new sequenced\ngenomes is exploding. As of January 2019, there are more than\n7000 eukaryotic and almost 180,000 prokaryotic genomes publicly\navailable (information retrieved on January 16, 2019, fromhttps://\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/). However, this comes\nwith a price; most of the recently sequenced genomes, due to the\nshort read sequencing technology, are available at various levels of\nTransposable Elements: Classiﬁcation, Identiﬁcation, and Their Use ... 189\n“completeness” or assembly. For most non-model organisms, we\nare presented with draft assemblies of rather short contigs. More-\nover, these genomes usually are not very well annotated, with TEs\nnot being on the annotation priority list. Unfortunately, genome\nannotation pipelines do not include TE annotation, focusing on\nprotein-coding and RNA-coding genes. To ﬁll the gap, a number of\nmethods have been developed to detect repeats from short reads.\nTwo algorithms dominate in attempts to determine repeats in NGS\nraw reads: clustering andk-mer. Transposome [96] and RepeatEx-\nplorer [97] employ the former approach, while RepARK [98],\nREPdenovo [99], and dnaPipeTE [100] utilize the latter one.\nSince NGS results in the relatively short reads, assembly of selected\nsequences into longer contigs representing TEs is required after\ninitial clustering of the raw reads.\n4.3 Population-Level\nAnalyses of\nTransposable\nElements\nRecent advances in sequencing technology and the sharp decrease\nin sequencing costs allow genomic studies at population level.\nAlthough initially focused on human populations [ 101–103],\nrecent population studies of other species have been initiated as\nwell [104, 105]. One of the common questions in such studies is\nFig. 3 Graphical output of the Gepard. A 30 kb fragment of mouse chromosome\n12 was compared to itself. Similar sequences are represented by diagonal lines\nif both fragments are located on the same strains or by reverse diagonal lines if\nthe fragments with signiﬁcant similarity are located on opposite strands. Some\nof the examples are marked with the red circles. Simple repeats are represented\nby either diamond shapes on the main diagonal or horizontal and vertical lines.\nSome of the examples are marked with the red squares\n190 Wojciech Makałowski et al.\nhow much structural variation (SV) exists in different populations.\nTE insertions are responsible for about 25% of structural variants in\nhuman genomes [106]. In general, any tool designed for detection\nof SV should work for TE insertion analysis, but specialized soft-\nware can take advantage of speciﬁc expectations related to inser-\ntions of TEs. Most of the SV-detection algorithms rely on paired-\nend reads and are based on discordant read pair mapping and/or\nsplit reads mapping (Fig.4). A discordant pair read is deﬁned as one\nthat is inconsistent with the expected insert size in the library used\nfor sequencing. For example, if the insert size of the library used for\nsequencing is 300 nt but the reads map to a reference genome\nwithin much larger distance or to two different chromosomes,\nsuch a pair is considered to be discordant. If, additionally, one of\nthe reads maps to a TE, it might be an indication of a polymorphic\nTE. Usually some ﬁltering is used to reduce a chance of false\npositives. These include minimum read number in the cluster\nmapped to a unique position, quality score of the reads, or consis-\ntency in reads orientation. However, the discordant read mapping\ncannot detect exact insertion position. Therefore another step is\nrequired that may include local assembly and split-read mapping.\na\nb\nd\nc\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nk\nl\nn\nm\no\np\nq\nr\ns\nt\nActual genomic fragment with a TE insertion\nReference genome - a TE missing\na\nb\nd\nc\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nk\nl\nn\nm\no\np\nq\nr\ns\nt\nk\nl\nn\nm\no\np\nq\nr\ns\nt\nFig. 4 Detection of a TE insertion (polymorphic TE) from the NGS data.

The hypothetical split reads (c, e, h, m, p, and r) will have\npart of the sequence mapped to the reference genome and the other to a TE consensus sequence\nTransposable Elements: Classiﬁcation, Identiﬁcation, and Their Use ... 191\nA split read is deﬁned as a read for which part of it maps\nuniquely to one position in the genome and the other part to\nanother position. This is, for example, a very common feature of\nthe mapping of RNA-seq data to eukaryotic genomes when reads\nspan two exons. Split reads are being also observed if structural\nvariants exist. In a case of a TE insertion, a part of the read will be\nmapped to a unique location and the rest to a TE in some other\nlocation or may not be mapped at all (Fig.4).\nDifferent methods for structure variant detection return differ-\nent results on the same data. Recently published benchmarking\ndemonstrates that TE detection is not an exception\n[107, 108]. Ewing [107] compared TranspoSeq [109] with two\nother tools, Tea [110] and TraFIC [111], on the same data sets.\nResults were not very encouraging as in both comparisons there\nwas a high fraction of insertions detected only by a single program\n[107]. Similar conclusion was drawn by Rishishwar et al. [108]i na\nbenchmark of larger number of tools including MELT [106],\nMobster [112], and RetroSeq [113]. It is clear that different soft-\nware have different biases, and each one can produce a high number\nof false positives. It is recommended then to employ several pro-\ngrams for high conﬁdence results. Exhaustive tests run on real and\nsimulated human genome data showed superior performance of\nMELT [106, 108]. TIPseqHunter is another tool developed to\nidentify transposon insertion sites based on the transpose insertion\nproﬁling using next-generation sequencing [ 114]. It employs\nmachine learning algorithm to ensure high precision and reliability.\nIt is worth to note that all these tools were designed for short read\nsequencing methods. However, with current development of\nsingle-molecule long reads, sequencing technologies such as Pac-\nBio and Oxford Nanopore may make these methods irrelevant and\nobsolete. Long reads should be of superior performance and make\nTE insertion detection relatively easy with more traditional\naligners, such as MegaBLAST [115], BLAT [116], or LAST [117].\n4.4 Comparative\nGenomics of TE\nInsertions\nTo understand the general pattern of TE insertions in different\ngenomes and evolutionary dynamics of TE families, a comparative\napproach is necessary. Although precomputed alignments of differ-\nent genomes are publicly available, for example, the UCSC\nGenome Browser includes Multiz alignments of 100 vertebrate\ngenomes [118], not many tools are available for such analyses.\nOne of them is GPAC (genome presence/absence compiler) that\ncreates a table of presence and absence of certain elements based on\nthe precomputed multiple genomes alignment [119]( http://bioin\nformatics.uni-muenster.de/tools/gpac/index.hbi). The tool is\nquite generic, but is well suited for the TE comparative analysis\n(see Fig. 5 for an example).\n192 Wojciech Makałowski et al.\nFig. 5 The output table of the GPAC software. Several Alu elements were analyzed for presence/absence in 11 primate species. The human genome was used a reference, and\n“hit coordinates” refer to that genome along with the information on the annotated elements in the hit region and a type of the region. For each genome, the presence (+) or\nabsence (/C0 ) of the hit is presented. x/ denotes that only part of the original insertion (less than 20%) is present in a given genome, and¼¼ indicates that more than 80% of the\nexpected sequence is not alignable in a given locus. The optional phylogenetic tree constructed based on the obtained data is shown in the lower right corner\n4.5 Classiﬁcation of\nTransposable\nElements\nOnce the consensus of a repetitive element has been constructed, it\ncan be subjected to further analyses. There are two major categories\nof programs dealing with the issue of TE classiﬁcation: library or\nsimilarity-based and signature-based. The latter approach is very\noften used in specialized software, i.e., tailored for speciﬁc type of\nTEs. However, some general tools also exist, e.g., TEclass [120].\nThe library approach is probably the most common approach\nfor TE classiﬁcation. It is also very efﬁcient and quite reliable as long\nas good libraries of prototype sequences exist. In practice, it is the\nrecommended approach when we analyze sequences from well-\ncharacterized genomes or from a genome relatively closely related\nto a well-studied one. For instance, since the human genome is one\nof the best studied, any primate sequences can be conﬁdently\nanalyzed using the library approach. Most likely, the ﬁrst software\nusing the similarity-based approach for repeat classiﬁcation was\nCensor developed by Jerzy Jurka in the early 1990s [121]. It uses\nRepBase [122] as a reference collection and BLAST as a search\nengine [91]. However, the most popular TE detection software is\nRepeatMasker (RM) ( http://www.repeatmasker.org). Interest-\ningly, RM is also using RepBase as a reference collection and\nAB-BLAST, RM-BLAST, or cross-match as a search engine. In\nboth cases, original search hits are processed by a series of Perl\nscripts to determine the structure of elements and classify them to\none of known TE families. Both Censor and RM also employ user-\nprovided libraries, including “third-party” lineage-speciﬁc libraries,\ne.g., TREP [123]. Over the years, RepeatMasker has become a\nstandard tool for TE analyses, and often its output is used for\nmore biologically oriented studies (see below). The aforemen-\ntioned programs have one important drawback: since they are\ncompletely based on sequence similarity, they can detect only TEs\nthat had been previously described. Nevertheless, similarity\nsearches, like in many other bioinformatics tasks, should be the\nﬁrst approach for the analysis of repetitive elements.\nSignature-based programs are searching for certain features\nthat characterize speciﬁc TEs, for example, long terminal repeats\n(LTRs), target site duplications (TSDs), or primer-binding sites\n(PBSs). Since different types (families) of elements are structurally\ndifferent, they require speciﬁc rules for their detection. Hence,\nmany of the programs that use signature-based algorithms are\nspeciﬁc for certain type of transposons. There are a number of\nprograms specialized in detection of LTR transposons, which are\nbased on a similar methodology. They take into account several\nstructural features of LTR retroposons including size, distance\nbetween paired LTRs and their similarity, the presence of TSDs,\nand the presence of replication signals, i.e., the primer-binding site\nand the polypurine tract (PPTs). Some of the programs check also\nfor ORFs coding for thegag, pol, andenv proteins. LTR_STRUC\n[124] was one of the ﬁrst programs based on this principle. It uses\n194 Wojciech Makałowski et al.\nseed-and-extend strategy to ﬁnd repeats located within user-\ndeﬁned distance. The candidate regions are extended based on\nthe pairwise alignment to determine cognate LTRs’ boundaries.\nPutative full-length elements are scored based on the presence of\nTSD, PBS, PPT, and reverse transcriptase ORF. However, because\nof the heuristics described above, LTR_STRUC is unable to ﬁnd\nincomplete LTR transposons and in particular solo LTRs. Another\nlimitation of this program is its Windows-only implementation that\nsigniﬁcantly prohibits automated large-scale analysis. Several other\nprograms have been developed based on similar principles, e.g.,\nLTR_par [125], ﬁnd_LTR [ 126], LTR_FINDER [ 127], and\nLTRharvest [128]. Lerat tested performance of these programs\n[129], and although sensitivity of the methods was acceptable\n(between 40% and 98%), it was at the expense of speciﬁcity, which\nwas very poor. In several cases, the number of falsely assigned\ntransposons exceeded the number of correctly detected ones.\nAnother group of transposons that have a relatively conserved\nstructure are MITEs and Helitrons. Several specialized programs\nwere developed that take advantage of their speciﬁc structure.\nFINDMITE [130] and MUST [131] are tailored for MITEs,\nwhile HelitronFinder [132] and HelSearch [133] were developed\nfor Helitron detection.\nA further interesting approach to transposon classiﬁcation was\nimplemented by Abrusan et al. [120] in the software package called\nTEclass, which classiﬁes unknown TE consensus sequences into\nfour categories, according to their mechanism of transposition:\nDNA transposons, LTRs, LINEs, and SINEs. The classiﬁcation\nuses support vector machines, random forests, learning vector\nquantization, and predicts ORFs. Two complete sets of classiﬁers\nare built using tetramers and pentamers, which are used in two\nseparate rounds of the classiﬁcation. The software assumes that the\nanalyzed sequence represents a TE and the classiﬁcation process is\nbinary, with the following steps: forward versus reverse sequence\norientation > DNA versus retrotransposon > LTRs versus\nnonLTRs (for retroelements)> LINEs versus SINEs (for nonLTR\nrepeats). If the different methods of classiﬁcation lead to conﬂicting\nresults, TEclass reports the repeat either as unknown or as the last\ncategory where the classiﬁcation methods agree (http://bioinfor\nmatics.uni-muenster.de/tools/teclass/index.hbi).\n4.6 Pipelines Recent years witnessed some attempt to create more complex,\nglobal analyses systems. One such a system is REPCLASS\n[134]. It consists of three classiﬁcation modules: homology\n(HOM), structure (STR), and target site duplication (TSD). Each\nmodule can be run separately or in the pairwise manner, whereas\nthe ﬁnal step of the analysis involves integration of the results\ndelivered by each module. There is one interesting novelty in the\nSTR module, namely, implementation oftRNAscan-SE [135]t o\nTransposable Elements: Classiﬁcation, Identiﬁcation, and Their Use ... 195\ndetect tRNA-like secondary structure within the query sequence,\none of the signatures of many SINE families. The REPPET is\nanother pipeline for TE sequence analyses. It uses “classical”\nthree-step approach for de novo TE identiﬁcation: self-alignment,\nclustering, and consensus sequences generation. However, the\npipeline is using a spectrum of different methods at each step,\nfollowed by a rigorous TE classiﬁcation step based on recently\nproposed classiﬁcation of TEs [136]. Unfortunately, a complex\nimplementation that makes installation and running the system\nrather difﬁcult limits usage of the pipeline. The classiﬁcation step\nseems to be unreliable as it may annotate lineage-speciﬁc TEs in\nwrong taxonomical lineages (Kouzel and Makalowski,\nunpublished data).\nThere are other attempts to create comprehensive systems for\n“repeatome” analysis. One of them is dnaPipeTE developed for\nmosquito genomes’ analyses [ 100]. Interestingly, dnaPipeTE\nworks on the raw NGS data, which makes the pipeline well suited\nfor genomes with lower sequencing depth. The raw reads are ﬁrst\nsubjected tok-mer count on the sampled data. The sampling of the\ndata to size less than 0.25/C2 of the genome is required to avoid\nclustering reads representing unique sequences. The determined\nrepetitive reads are assembled into contigs using Trinity\n[137]. Although Trinity was originally developed for transcriptome\nassembly from RNA-seq data, it proves to be very useful for TEs\nassembly from short reads as it can efﬁciently determine consensus\nsequences of closely related transposons. In the next step, dnaPi-\npeTE annotates repeats using RepeatMasker with either built-in or\nuser-deﬁned libraries. This is probably the weakest point of the\npipeline as it will not annotate any novel TEs, which have no similar\nsequences present in the provided libraries. It would be useful to\ncomplement this step with model-based or machine learning\napproaches (see Subheading 4.5). After contigs’ annotation, copy\nnumber of the TEs are estimated using BLAST algorithm\n[91]. Finally, sequence identity between an individual TE and its\nconsensus sequence is used to determine the relative age of the TEs.\nThe pipeline produces a number of output ﬁles including several\ngraphs, i.e., pie chart with the relative proportion of the main\nrepeat classes and graph with the number of base pairs aligned on\neach TE contig and TE age distribution. Overall, the dnaPipeTE is\nvery efﬁcient, outperforming, according to the authors, RepeatEx-\nplorer by severalfold [100].\n4.7 Meta-analyses Most of the software developed are focused on the TE discovery\nand rarely offer more biological oriented analyses. Consequently,\nresearchers interested in TE biology or using TE insertions as tools\nfor another biological investigations need to utilize other resources.\nOne of them is TinT (transposition in transposition), tool that\napplies maximum likelihood model of TE insertion probability to\n196 Wojciech Makałowski et al.\nestimate relative age of TE families [138]( http://bioinformatics.\nuni-muenster.de/tools/tint/index.hbi). In the ﬁrst steps, it takes\nRepeatMasker output to detect nested retroposons. Then, it gen-\nerates a data matrix that is used by a probabilistic model to estimate\nchronology and activity period of analyzed families. The method\nwas applied to resolve the evolutionary history of galliformes [139],\nmarsupials [140], lagomorphs [141], squirrel monkey [142], or\nelephant shark [143].\nAnother interesting application that takes advantage of TEs is\ntheir use for detecting signatures of positive selection [144], a\ncentral goal in the ﬁeld of evolutionary biology. A typical research\nscenario for this application would be investigating whether a spe-\nciﬁc TE fragment exapted into resident genomic features, such as\nproximal and distal enhancers or exons of spliced transcripts, has\nundergone accelerated evolution that could be indicative of gain of\nfunction events. In short, the test ﬁrst requires the identiﬁcation of\nall genomically interspersed TE fragments that are homolog to the\nTE segment of interest, which can be done through alignments\nwith a family consensus sequence. Based on multi-species genome\nalignments, a second step involves identiﬁcation of lineage-speciﬁc\nsubstitutions in every single homolog fragment, which are then\nconsolidated into a distribution of lineage-speciﬁc substitutions\nthat provides the expectation (null distribution) for a segment\nevolving largely without speciﬁc constraints (neutrally). A signiﬁ-\ncantly higher number of lineage-speciﬁc substitutions observed in\nthe TE fragment of interest compared to the null distribution could\nthen be interpreted as a molecular signature of adaptive evolution.\nHowever, the possibility of confounding molecular mechanisms,\nsuch as GC-biased gene conversion [145–147], needs to be eval-\nuated. We note that building the null distribution based only on\ndata from intergenic regions, where transcription-coupled repair is\nabsent, results in a more liberal estimate of the expected substitu-\ntions, which in turn leads to a more conservative estimate of the\nadaptive evolution. Additionally, building the null distribution\nrequires the detection of many homolog fragments, which limits\nthe applicability of the test to TE families with numerous members\nin a given genome. Prime examples would be human Alu or murine\nB1 SINEs. In theory, this test could also be used for detecting\nsignatures of purifying selection by searching for fragments\ndepleted of lineage-speciﬁc substitutions. However, the low level\nor complete lack of lineage-speciﬁc substitution is characteristic to\nmany TE fragments, obscuring the effect of potential purifying\nforces.\nTransposable Elements: Classiﬁcation, Identiﬁcation, and Their Use ... 197\n5 Concluding Remarks\nAnnoying junk for some, hidden treasure for others, TEs can hardly\nbe ignored [148]. With their diversity and high copy number in\nmost of the genomes, they are not the easiest biological entities to\nanalyze. Nevertheless, recent years witnessed increased interest in\nTEs. On the one hand, we observe improvement in computational\ntools specialized in TE analyses.
