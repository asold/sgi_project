Particular atten-\ntion is typically given to protein-coding changes often neglecting the potential impact of\nexonic variants on RNA splicing. Here, we used the exon 10 ofMLH1, a gene implicated\nin hereditary cancer, as a model system to assess the prevalence of RNA splicing mutations\namong all single-nucleotide variants identified in a given exon by using minigene-based\nassays. Our study revealed an unexpected high proportion of splicing mutations inMLH1\nexon 10 mostly affecting potential exonic splicing regulatory elements (ESRs), which are\ntypically difficult to predict by usingin silicotools. We then used five experimental data-\nsets (MLH1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CFTR and NF1) to evaluate the predictive power of 3in silico\napproaches recently described for pinpointing ESR-mutations. What’s more, besides pre-\ndicting which exonic variants affect splicing,ΔtESRseq andΔHZ\nEI values also indicated\nthe direction and severity of the induced splicing defects. In contrast, theΔC-based\napproach did not show a compelling predictive power. Our data indicates that exonic\nsplicing mutations are more prevalent than currently appreciated and that they can now\nbe predicted by using bioinformatics methods. These findings have implications for all\ngenetically-caused diseases.\nIntroduction\nTremendous progress has been made in recent years in high-throughput technologies enabling\nfast and affordable massive parallel DNA sequencing. These methods are now being imple-\nmented both in molecular diagnostic settings and in basic research laboratories and hold great\npromise for discovering the genetic bases of rare and complex diseases [\n1]. However, even if\nnext-generation sequencing has greatly improved the detection of nucleotide changes in the\ngenome of each individual, the biological and clinical interpretation of most variants remains\nchallenging, representing one of the major hurdles in current medical genetics [\n2,3]. Several\nreasons account for the difficulty in distinguishing which variants may cause or contribute to\ndisease [4,5]: (i) the number of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected in each genome is\nvery high, (ii) many disorders are genetically heterogeneous and often caused by rare variants,\n(iii) access to clinical and family data, such as pedigrees, is frequently limited, (iv)in silicotools\naiming at identifying deleterious changes are still imperfect, and (v) biological samples from\nvariant carriers are rarely available for functional analysis. There is obviously a great need for\novercoming these limitations, and considerable efforts are now deployed for developing strate-\ngies allowing prioritization of variants for functional testing [\n4,6].\nIn general, scrupulous attention is given to exonic SNVs mapping to protein coding regions,\nespecially to those producing missense changes. Indeed, one of the most widely used strategies\nfor narrowing down the number of variants susceptible of causing disease is to use a combina-\ntion ofin silicotools that focus on protein features (such as PolyPhen-2, SIFT and Mutation\nAssessor, among others) [7– 9]. Yet, such protein-centric view of the exome landscape merely\nrepresents a fraction of the“expression code” underlying each gene sequence. Current knowl-\nedge clearly indicates that, besides their protein coding potential, exonic sequences can play an\nimportant role in RNA splicing (reviewed in [10,11]). Notably, (i) the first and the last 3 exonic\npositions are an integral part of 3’and 5’splice site (3’ss and 5’ss) consensus sequences, and (ii)\nexons may also contain splicing regulatory elements (ESRs), such as exonic splicing enhancers\n(ESEs) and exonic splicing silencers (ESSs). ESEs and ESSs usually correspond to 6– 8\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 2/2 6\nCompeting Interests:The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\nnucleotide stretches that serve as landing pads for splicing activator or splicing repressor pro-\nteins, respectively, thereby influencing the recruitment and activity of the splicing machinery.\nWhereas 3’ss and 5’ss consensus sequences have been extensively characterized leading to the\ndevelopment ofin silicotools that reliably predict alterations in splice site strength (such as\nMaxEntScan, SpliceSiteFinder-like and Human Splicing Finder, among others), ESRs are still\npoorly understood and generally regarded as difficult to predict by using bioinformatics\napproaches [12– 15].\nLately, three newin silicoapproaches were described as promising tools to predict variant-\ninduced ESR alterations. The first approach relies on ESRseq scores established through experi-\nmental assessment of the ESR properties of all possible 6-nucleotide motifs [16]. Calculation of\ntotal ESRseq score changes (ΔtESRseq), taking into account overlapping hexamers and variant-\ninduced changes, was then implemented by our group as a tool to predict the impact on splic-\ning produced by exonic variants [17]. The second approach is based on ZEI scores derived from\na RESCUE-type analysis that computed the relative distribution of hexamer motifs in exons\nand introns [18]. According to this study, the value of total HZEI score changes (ΔHZEI, also\ncorresponding to overlapping hexamers) can be applied for predicting the impact on splicing\nof any exonic variant. The third and last approach relies onΔC values (C, percent spliced in)\nthat were bioinformatically established upon compilation of RNAseq data obtained from dif-\nferent tissues, and integration of a large set of pre-established sequence features [\n19]. TheΔC-\nbased approach was developed to predict splicing aberrations induced by any sequence change,\neither intronic or exonic, including variants affecting splice sites or splicing regulatory signals.\nToday, it is estimated that ~15% of all point mutations causing human inherited disorders\ndisrupt splice-site consensus sequences, particularly at intronic positions [\n20]. Yet, it is now\nspeculated, based onin silicodata, that disease-causing aberrant RNA splicing may be more\nwidespread than currently appreciated, with up to 25% of exonic disease-associated variants\nbeing expected to disturb ESRs [11,21]. Here, we decided to use the exon 10 of theMLH1 gene\nas a paradigm to experimentally evaluate these assumptions.MLH1 exon 10 was selected as\nmodel system for 3 main reasons: (i)MLH1 is the major gene implicated in Lynch syndrome,\none of the most frequent forms of hereditary cancer worldwide, formerly known as hereditary\nnonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), (ii) this gene exhibits a large mutational spectrum,\nwith at least 30% of variants being currently classified as variants of unknown significance and\nfor which large national and international efforts persist in bringing clarification [\n22,23], and\n(iii) alterations of potential ESRs were already reported for 3 SNVs in this exon [13,24].\nWe retrieved all SNVs identified inMLH1 exon 10 and analyzed their impact on splicing by\nresorting to both minigene-based assays and analysis of patient’s RNA when available. More-\nover, we used our experimental data to perform a comparative analysis of the 3 newly devel-\noped in silicotools aiming at predicting variant-induced ESR alterations. Our results revealed\nan unexpected high number of splicing mutations inMLH1 exon 10, most of which affecting\npotential ESRs, thus corroborating our initial hypotheses. Moreover, we confirmed the predic-\ntive power ofΔtESRseq- andΔHZ\nEI- based approaches, but not that ofΔC, for pinpointing\nthis type of mutations.\nResults\nIdentification of an unexpected high proportion of splicing mutations in\nthe exon 10 ofMLH1\nWe have recently shown that a high number of variants (15 out of 36, i.e. 42%) identified in the\nexon 7 of theBRCA2 gene have a negative impact on splicing [17], a finding strongly suggesting\nthat eitherBRCA2 exon 7 is exceptionally sensitive to exonic splicing mutations, or that this\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 3/2 6\ntype of mutations is more frequent than currently estimated. To test these hypotheses, we\ndecided to study the impact on splicing of SNVs identified in another gene, more specifically in\nMLH1, a gene implicated in Lynch syndrome. Our approach was to use the exon 10 ofMLH1\nas a model system. We began by interrogating National and International public databases in\norder to retrieve all single substitutions reported in this exon (\nTable 1and Fig 1A). As a result,\nwe found a total of 22 SNVs, most of which identified in cancer patients suspected of Lynch\nsyndrome, including 15 missense, 3 nonsense and 4 synonymous variants. Only 9 of these\nSNVs are currently classified as clearly pathogenic, and 1 as clearly not pathogenic (\nTable 1).\nTo assess the impact of all 22 variants onMLH1 exon 10 splicing, we performed anex vivo\nsplicing assay with pSPL3m-M1e10-derived minigenes (Fig 1B). As shown on Figs1C and S1,\nthe wild-type pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene predominantly generated transcripts containing exon\n10 (79% exon inclusion), and a minority of transcripts without exon 10. These results are in\nagreement with those previously reported by using the same minigene system [13], and indi-\ncate that wild-type pSPL3m-M1e10 mimics, at least in part, the alternative splicing pattern of\nendogenous MLH1 transcripts [25– 27] (~35% to 67% exon 10 inclusion in normal blood sam-\nples, according to a study from Charbonnier and collaborators [25]). Importantly, the mini-\ngene assay results revealed that 17 out of the 22 SNVs (77%) altered the splicing pattern of\nexon 10 relative to wild-type (Figs\n1C and S1). More precisely, 13 variants increased exon skip-\nping, 4 variants increased exon inclusion, and only 5 variants showed no effect on splicing.

A bioionformatics analysis using splice\nsite-dedicated algorithms revealed that both variants, c.840T>A and c.842C>T, create a\n5’splice site at exonic position +46 (MLH1 c.836, S1C Fig), which explains the 48-nucleotide\ndeletion at the end of the exon but not the predominant exclusion of the entire exon.\nTo gain further insight into the severity of the splicing defects of the 13 mutants that\ninduced exon 10 skipping in pSPL3m-M1e10, we tested these variants in the context of\nanother splicing reporter minigene, pCAS2-M1e10 (\nS2 Fig), previously shown to be less sensi-\ntive to splicing mutations than pSPL3m-M1e10 [13]. Our results indicate that, in contrast to\npSPL3m-M1e10 and as expected, wild-type pCAS2-M1e10 exclusively generated transcripts\ncontaining exon 10. We also observed that 5 out of 6 variants from the first category exhibited\na behavior similar to the one observed with the pSPL3m minigenes, i.e. near-total exon 10\nskipping; the exception being c.882C>T that induced partial, though strong, exon 10 skipping\nin the pCAS2 system. Four out of 5 variants from the second category showed splicing defects\nless severe than the ones observed with pSPL3m-M1e10 and, in one case, c.851T>A, no splic-\ning anomaly was detected. One should note that the level of exon skipping induced by this last\nvariant was borderline noticeable in the pSPL3m-derived minigene (\nFig 1Cand S1 Table). As\nfor the third category group, we observed that the splicing defects detected in the pSPL3m\nminigene were faithfully reproduced in pCAS2 for one of the variants (c.842C>T, which pre-\ndominantly yielded exon-skipped products) but not for the other (c.840T>A). The fact that,\nin the pCAS2 system, c.840T>A predominantly produced transcripts containing exon 10\ndeleted of its last 48 nucleotides and almost no exon-skipped products (\nS2 Fig) suggests that\nthe type and severity of the splicing defect caused by this variant depends on surrounding\nnucleotide context.\nWe surmise, given their position at the termini of the exon, that 7 out of the 17 splicing\nmutations detected in exon 10 directly affect the definition of the reference splice sites, either\nat the level of the 3’splice site (YAG│G, first exonic position underlined) or of the 5’splice site\n(CAG│GURAGU, 3 last exonic positions underlined) [10]. Accordingly, the effects produced\nby these 7 variants (c.791A>G, c.882C>G, c.882C>T, c.883A>C, c.883A>G, c.884G>Aa n d\nc.884G>C) could have been predicted by algorithms commonly used to predict the strength\nof splice sites, such as Splice Site Finder, MaxEntScan, and Human Splice Finder (HSF-ss). As\nshown on\nS3 Fig, in silicodata derived from these programs strongly suggest that c.791A>G\nimproves exon inclusion by directly increasing the strength of the 3’splice site, and that the\nvariants at the last three positions of the exon (c.882 to c.884), induce exon skipping by\ndecreasing, to different extents, the strength of the 5’splice site. Moreover, according to this\nbioinformatics analysis, especially with MaxEntScan (MES), one could have correctly pre-\ndicted that the splicing defect produced by c.882C>G is less severe than the one induced by\nc.882C>T. Our data further indicates that a decrease in 5’ss MES score of/C2119% predicts very\ndrastic exon 10 skipping.\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 6/2 6\nBecause the 10 remaining splicing mutations detected inMLH1 exon 10 are located outside\nthe positions directly defining the splice sites, we strongly suspect that they interfere with exon\nrecognition by altering ESRs. This type of splicing mutations includes variants that map within\nthe first two thirds of exon 10 and are responsible for inducing either exon skipping\n(c.793C>A, c.793C>T, c.794G>A c.840T>A, c.842C>T, c.845C>G and c.851T>A) or exon\ninclusion (c.814T>G, c.815T>C and c.855C>T).\nDetection of potential splicing regulatory elements in the exon 10 of\nMLH1\nTo better understand howMLH1 exon 10 splicing is regulated and how certain SNVs disturb\nthis process, we decided to functionally characterize different regions of the exon in the context\nof pcDNA-Dup. This three-exon minigene contains a middle exon particularly sensitive to alter-\nations of splicing regulatory elements [13,17,28]. For this purpose, four partially overlapping\nsegments covering the entire exon 10 ofMLH1 (R1 to R4, ~30 bp-long each) were individually\ninserted into the middle exon of this construct and then tested in the context of anex vivosplic-\ning assay (Fig 2A and 2B). As shown inFig 2C, our results revealed that region R1 (MLH1\nc.791-819) strongly contributed to the recognition of the middle exon. Regions R2 (c.809-c.840),\nR3 (c.828-c.859) and R4 (c.856-c.884) had a positive effect on exon inclusion as well, although\nmore moderate for R2 and R3 (in comparison to R1), and weak for R4. Next, we tested all\nMLH1 exon 10 splicing mutations suspected of altering splicing regulatory elements (n = 10,\nFig\n2A). Importantly, we found that 8 out of these 10 variations altered the splicing efficiency of the\nmiddle exon relative to wild-type (Fig 2D). Variants c.793C>A and c.793C>T (both tested in\nthe context of the R1 segment) induced exon skipping, with c.793C>A having an effect stronger\nthan c.793C>T and thus faithfully recapitulating the defects initially detected in pSPL3m-\nM1e10 and pCAS2-M1e10 minigene assays. The impact on splicing of variants c.814T>G and\nc.815T>C was also reproduced in the context of pcDNA-Dup as both variants led to an increase\nin middle exon inclusion (R2 segment). Finally, variants c.840T>A, c.842C>T, c.845C>G and\nc.851T>A induced middle exon skipping (R3 segment), with c.842C>T having the more pro-\nnounced effect, reminiscent of the effects observed in the pSPL3m-M1e10 and pCAS2-M1e10\nassays. Results obtained with c.793C>T and c.842C>T agree with those previously reported by\nusing the pcDNA-Dup system [\n13]. In contrast, we found that the splicing alterations induced\nby c.794G>A and c.855C>T in the context of pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene could not be repro-\nduced in the pcDNA-Dup assay. As shown onFig 2D, c.794G>A did not induce middle exon\nskipping (R1 segment), and c.855C>T did not lead to an increase in exon inclusion (R3 seg-\nment), on the contrary, it slightly increased middle exon skipping. We hypothesize that the\neffect on splicing of these particular variants depends on surrounding nucleotide context. In\nconclusion, these experiments point to an apparent asymmetry in the distribution of ESRs in\nMLH1 exon 10, with a potential ESE-enrichment at the 5’portion, corresponding to about the\nfirst 2/3 of the exon, and/or an ESS-enrichment towards the 3’end. Moreover, the evidence of\nportability, i.e. that the splicing defects caused by most of the analyzed SNVs can be reproduced\nin a completely heterologous system, further supports the hypothesis that these variants modify\nbona fidesplicing regulatory elements.\nBioinformatics approaches based onΔtESRseq or onΔHZEI can predict\nwhich exonic variants affect splicing regulatory elements\nThree independentin silicoapproaches based on the calculation of eitherΔtESRseq [17],\nΔHZEI [18], orΔC [19] values were recently described as promising tools for predicting vari-\nants that potentially modify splicing regulatory elements.

We started by separating the fifteenMLH1 exon 10 SNVs located at dis-\ntance from the splice sites into three groups based on the minigene results (S1 Table). The first\ngroup included mutations that increased exon 10 skipping (n = 7), the second group included\nvariations with no effect on exon 10 splicing (n = 5) and the third group included those that\nincreased exon 10 inclusion (n = 3). Then, score differences (ΔtESRseq, ΔHZEI, andΔC)w e r e\ncalculated for each variant and plotted in a parallel fashion in order to easily confront the dis-\ncriminating power of the three bioinformatics approaches (Fig 3). Visual inspection of the\nplots revealed a striking distribution ofΔtESRseq clearly distinguishing the 3 groups of vari-\nants. More specifically, most variants with no effect on exon 10 splicing seemed to display\nΔtESRseq values higher than those increasing exon skipping and lower than those increasing\nexon inclusion. This feature was not so clearly noticeable forΔHZEI or ΔC. A statistical analy-\nsis further confirmed thatΔtESRseq values were overall concordant with the separation of vari-\nants in 3 groups according to minigene data (ANOVA test, p-value of 0.03), whereasΔHZEI\nand ΔC were not (ANOVA test, p-values of 0.15 and 0.59, respectively) (Fig 3and S1 Table).\nTo better assess the performances of the threein silicoapproaches, we set preliminary upper\nand lower thresholds for predicting variant-induced exon skipping and variant-induced exon\ninclusion: -0.5 and +0.5 forΔtESRseq, -20 and +20 forΔHZEI, and -0.05 and +0.05 forΔC\n[19], respectively (Fig 3). As a consequence, score differences (Δ) smaller than the pre-estab-\nlished negative thresholds were considered indicative of increased exon skipping, whereas\nthose higher than the positive thresholds were considered indicative of increased exon inclu-\nsion. We then determined the relative number of true calls produced by eachin silicoapproach\ngiving a particular attention to predictions of exon skipping, the most dreaded variant-induced\nsplicing defect. As shown inFig 3and S1 Table, we observed that theΔtESRseq approach pro-\nduced the highest number of true calls, outperformingΔHZEI and ΔC in discriminating vari-\nants that induce exon skipping from those that do not. More specifically, one can reckon 13\n(87%) true calls forΔtESRseq against 9 (60%) true calls for bothΔHZ\nEI and ΔC. Overall, our\nresults revealed a better sensitivity (86% versus 57%) and specificity (88% versus 63%) for\nΔtESRseq than forΔHZEI (S1 Table). In spite of displaying a level of specificity similar to\nΔtESRseq (88%),ΔC showed a very high false negative rate (29% sensitivity). Finally, a statisti-\ncal analysis further confirmed thatΔtESRseq values could discriminate variants that increased\nMLH1 exon 10 skipping from those that did not, whereasΔHZEI and ΔC could not (t-test, p-\nvalues of 0.01, 0.11 and 0.42, respectively).\nResults discordant with experimental data, such as theΔtESRseq values obtained forMLH1\nc.845C>G and c.855C>T (outliers inFig 3) may be due to features not taken into account by\nthe in silicoapproach such as the RNA secondary structure, the chromatin structure, the pres-\nence of ESRs longer than six nucleotides, or to a crosstalk with other splicing regulatory ele-\nments located nearby.\nNext, we wondered if these bioinformatics methods could predict the severity of the splicing\ndefects, i.e. if there was a correlation between the level of exon inclusion detected in the\npSPL3m-M1e10 assay and the score differences produced by theΔtESRseq, ΔHZEI and ΔC\napproaches. To answer this question, we plotted the minigene data against the score differences\ngenerated by thein silicoapproaches, and performed a regression analysis with both variables.\nAs shown on\nFig 4and S1 Table, our results revealed a linear distribution of thein silicoscore\ndifferences as a function of exon inclusion levels forΔtESRseq andΔHZEI but not for theΔC\napproach (Pearson correlation, p-values of 0.001, 0.004 and 0.93, respectively).\nThen, we decided to compare the performance of these three new ESR-dedicatedin silico\ntools with that of three previously used methods, more precisely EX-SKIP [29], ESEfinder\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 9/2 6\n[30,31] and HSF-SR [32]. As shown inS2 Table, EX-SKIP displayed relatively high specificity\n(75%) but low sensitivity (43%) in predicting exon-skipping mutations. Statistical analyses\nfurther revealed that EX-SKIP could not significantly distinguishMLH1 exon 10 variants that\nhad an effect on splicing from those that did not (t-test and ANOVA test, p-values of 0.22\nand 0.26, respectively). Still, we found that there was a correlation between the level of exon\n10 inclusion and EX-SKIP values (Pearson correlation, p-value of 0.02). Data derived from\nESEfinder, and especially HSF-SR, were difficult to interpret because of the presence of\nFig 3.

The\nprecise correspondence between eachΔ value (ΔtESRseq, ΔHZEI or ΔΨ), the level of exon inclusion observed in the pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene assay, and\nthe identity of the correspondingMLH1 exon 10 variant, is indicated onS1 Table.

Moreover, given their lack of comprehensiveness and global\nquantitation, the performance of these twoin silicotools could not be statistically analyzed,\nnor properly compared to that ofΔtESRseq, ΔΔHZEI, ΔC or EX-SKIP.\nTo further evaluate the performance of the recently developedΔtESRseq, ΔHZEI and ΔC-\nbased approaches, we extended our study to the dataset that first revealed the predictive poten-\ntial ofΔtESRseq [17]. This dataset includes a total of 32BRCA2 exon 7 variants located outside\nthe reference splice sites, some of which cause exon skipping (n = 11, suspected of altering\nESRs) and some do not (n = 21), as determined experimentally. As shown in\nS5 Figand S3\nTable, we found again by using this dataset thatΔtESRseq displayed a slightly better sensitivity\nand specificity thanΔHZEI (in this case, 100% versus 91%, and 86% versus 76%, respectively)\nwhereas ΔC showed very low sensitivity but high specificity (18% and 94%, respectively). Inter-\nestingly, not onlyΔtESRseq but alsoΔHZEI could distinguish variants that increased exon skip-\nping from those that did not (t-test, p-values of 3.5 e-6 and 5.7 e-6, respectively). Again,ΔC\ncould not discriminate these 2 groups of variants (t-test, p-value of 0.56). Moreover, we\nobserved a statistically significant correlation between the level ofBRCA2 exon 7 inclusion and\nthe score differences produced by theΔtESRseq andΔHZEI approaches (Pearson correlation,\np-values 1.1 e-6 and 0.9 e-3, respectively), whereasΔC showed no correlation (Pearson correla-\ntion, p-value = 0.15) (S6 Figand S3 Table). Finally, we completed our study by analyzing three\nadditional datasets experimentally characterized by other laboratories, namely: (i) a set of 42\nBRCA1 exon 6 variants [29], (ii) a set of 41CFTR exon 12 variants [33,34] and (iii) a set of 24\nNF1 exon 37 variants [35]. As shown inS4, S5 and S6 Tables, here again, we found thatΔtESR-\nseq andΔHZEI.had better sensitivity thanΔC for predicting which variants induce exon skip-\nping (67– 100% and 68– 100% versus 0– 33% sensitivity, respectively, depending on the dataset).\nStatistical analyses further highlighted the good performance ofΔtESRseq and especially\nΔHZEI, but not that ofΔC for discriminating variants that lead to exon skipping and for pre-\ndicting the severivity of the splicing defect within these 3 additional datasets (S7 Table).\nWe surmise that out of the three newin silicoapproaches expected to predict ESR-muta-\ntions [17– 19], ΔtESRseq andΔHZEI show the best performance at least for the five datasets\nanalyzed in our study. Indeed, these two approaches displayed a better balance between sensi-\ntivity and specificity thanΔC, or the priorin silicomethod EX-SKIP, for predicting exon skip-\nping-mutations (S8 Table). Importantly, we found thatΔtESRseq andΔHZEI can be used to\npredict not only the direction but also the severity of the induced splicing defects, more nega-\ntive score differences being indicative of higher exon skipping levels (S7 Table).\nMLH1 c.793C>T and c.842C>T are associated with drastic splicing\ndefects in patients’cells\nTo evaluate the physiological pertinence of theMLH1 exon 10 minigene assays and the above\ndescribed in silicopredictions, we set to compare our results with data derived from the analysis\nof RNA obtained from carriers ofMLH1 exon 10 variants, especially of those located outside\nsplice sites.

These data are concordant with previous\nstudies describing exon 10 as an alternative exon that is naturally partially skipped, either alone\nor in combination with exon 9 and/or exon 11 [25– 27]. We also observed that, as compared to\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 12 / 26\nFig 5.

Sequencing of the FL products revealed the presence of WT (c.793C) exon 10 only\n(Fig 5A, right panel), which suggests that in this sample the exon 10-skipped products mostly\nderive from the mutant allele (c.793T), and that the variant-associated splicing defect is very\nsevere. Importantly, the observation that c.793C>T is associated with a drastic splicing defect\nin endogenousMLH1 transcripts agrees with the data obtained in the minigene assays (Figs\n1,\n2 and S2), especially in the context of pSPL3m-M1e10 c.793C>T, which showed a very high\nlevel of exon skipping. To better evaluate the consequences of c.793C>To nMLH1 expression,\nand because Sanger sequencing is known to have low detection sensitivity, we then decided to\nmeasure the relative contribution of the WT and mutant alleles to the production of the full-\nlength (FL) transcripts by using an allele-specific primer extension method. Our findings,\nshown on\nFig 5B and 5C, indicate that the FL transcripts expressed from the mutant allele were\nin fact present in the blood cells of patient P793CT.1 but at very low level as compared to the WT\nallele (~10%). Given the results of our minigene assays, and RT-PCR analysis of patient’s RNA,\nwe conclude that this allelic imbalance is mostly due to c.793C>T-induced exon 10 skipping.\nMoreover, if one assumes that, in the blood cells of Patient P793CT.1, both alleles are transcribed\nin equal amounts, then one can deduce that the pSPL3m-M1e10 assay closely reflects the\neffects detectedin vivoin patient’s peripheral blood, at least for this variant.\nWe then analyzed LCL RNA from patient P\n842CT.1 (heterozygous forMLH1 c.842C>T) by\ncomparing to those from 5 controls, including: 3 healthy individuals, and 2 Lynch syndrome\npatients (P\n791-5TG.1 and P882CT.1) carryingMLH1 c.791-5T>G and c.882C>T mutations\ndirectly altering the 3’ss or 5’ss of exon 10, respectively [36]. Results shown onS7 Figindicate\nthat patient P842CT.1 has a splicing pattern similar to that of patients P791-5TG.1 and P882CT.1, i.e.\nan apparent decrease in the amount of FLMLH1 transcripts, a mild increase in exon 9– 10 skip-\nping (Δ9– 10) and a drastic increase in exon 10 skipping (Δ10), as compared to healthy controls.\nΔ10 transcripts were detected in LCLs treated with puromycin, strongly suggesting that the\naberrant Δ10 out-of-frame transcripts (S4B Fig) are degraded by the NMD pathway in these\ncell lines. As expected, the level ofΔ9– 10 in-frame transcripts did not increase in the presence\nof the NMD-inhibitor puromycin. Sequencing of the FL RT-PCR products of patients P842CT.1\nand P882CT.1 revealed the absence of c.842T and c.882T mutant FL transcripts (S7C Fig), indi-\ncating that c.842C>T and c.882C>T cause very severe splicing defects. Thesein vivoresults\nclearly agree with the pSPL3m and pCAS2 minigene assays, which revealed predominant exon\n10 skipping for both c.842C>T and c.882C>T (Figs1, 2 and S2).\nImportantly, these results highlight the physiological pertinence of thein silicopredictions\nproduced by theΔtESRseq andΔHZEI approaches. Indeed, these methods accurately pre-\ndicted the variant-induced splicing aberrations observedin vivoin patients carrying exonic\nSNVs, as shown here forMLH1 variants c.793C>T and c.842C>T, and (ii)BRCA2\nc.520C>To rc . 6 1 7 C>G[ 17,37].

We conclude thatΔtESRseq andΔHZEI,\nbut notΔC, are promising tools for prioritizing exonic variants for splicing assays.\nDiscussion\nThe present study was initiated to follow up on our observation that a large number of variants\nin the exon 7 ofBRCA2 induce exon skipping [17]. Our hypothesis was that exonic splicing\nmutations were also underestimated in other exons and genes. We thus decided to analyze the\nimpact on splicing of all SNVs identified in the exon 10 ofMLH1 (n = 22), a gene implicated in\nLynch syndrome. Before this study, only 5 SNVs inMLH1 exon 10 had been reported as caus-\ning aberrant splicing; more specifically, they were all shown to increase exon 10 skipping\n[13,24,36]. Our work not only confirmed those initial findings but, importantly, uncovered 12\nnew splicing mutations (8 exon skipping-, and 4 exon inclusion-mutations), bringing the num-\nber ofMLH1 exon 10 splicing mutations to a total of 17. Hence, our results revealed a striking\nhigh proportion of splicing mutations inMLH1 exon 10 (77%), largely exceeding the fraction\nof splicing mutations detected inBRCA2 exon 7 (42%) [\n17]. Moreover, we found that the\nmajority ofMLH1 exon 10 splicing mutations (~60%) map outside the reference splice-site\nconsensus sequences, indicating an important contribution of variant-induced ESR alterations\nin this exon.\nImportantly, among the 12 new splicing mutations inMLH1 exon 10, we identified 4 SNVs\ncausing increased exon inclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SNVs having a\npositive impact onMLH1 splicing. Besides full-length transcripts,MLH1 is known to normally\nproduce a fraction of transcripts lacking exon 10, such asΔ10, Δ9/10, Δ10/11 andΔ9/10/11\n[25,26], withΔ9/10 being one of the most frequently reported alternativeMLH1 isoforms [27].\nIt is possible that the 4 variants that increased exon 10 inclusion in our minigene assays also\ndisturb MLH1 physiological alternative splicing leading to a higher production of FL tran-\nscripts and lower amount ofΔ10, Δ9/10 andΔ9/10/11. Because the role of alternativeMLH1\nisoforms is still unknown [27], it is difficult to predict the biological and clinical consequences\nof these splicing alterations. Of note, a few cases of variant-induced exon inclusion have already\nbeen described in other genes. Particularly, previous studies have shown that mutations that\nincrease exon inclusion can have a significant clinical impact. For instance, they can behave as\nprotective factors, as is the case ofSMN2 c.859G>C (p.Gly287Arg), a variant that attenuates\nthe severity of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) by increasing inclusion ofSMN2 exon 7 [\n28,38].\nMoreover, mutations inducing exon inclusion can also be harmful, as is the case for the major-\nity of mutations identified in the exon 10 of theMicrotubule Associated Protein Taugene\n(MAPT) (reviewed in [39]). It has been shown that dysregulation ofMAPT exon 10 splicing\ndisrupts normal tau isoform ratio and leads to neurodegeneration and dementia: increased\nMAPT exon 10 skipping causes Pick disease, whereas increased inclusion typically causes\nFTDP-17 (frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17).\nGiven the challenging need in medical genetics for stratifying exonic variants for functional\nanalyses, we decided to use the experimental data generated in this study to evaluate the predic-\ntive power ofin silicotools at discerning splicing mutations. We found that the impact on splic-\ning of the sevenMLH1 exon 10 variants mapping within the splice-site consensus sequences\n(potential splice site-mutations) were correctly predicted by splice site-dedicatedin silicotools\n(SSF, MES and HSF-ss). These findings confirm and extend previous studies that highlighted\nthe good reliability of these algorithms for predicting exon skipping-mutations [12– 15], further\npinpointing their interest as filtering tools in variant stratification strategies. As for the variants\nlocated outside the reference splice sites, our minigene data revealed 10 ESR-mutations and 5\nvariants with no impact on splicing. We took advantage of these results and selected four\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 15 / 26\nadditional experimental datasets previously described in other genes [17,29,33– 35] to evaluate\nthe discriminating power of 3 bioinformatics approaches recently described as suitable for pre-\ndicting variant-induced ESR alterations [16– 19]. Our findings revealed that theΔtESRseq and\nΔHZEI ESR-dedicated tools show the best performance in identifying ESR-mutations, outper-\nforming the previous bioinformatics method EX-SKIP, whereasΔC did not show compelling\npredictive power. Our results further indicate that bothΔtESRseq- andΔHZEI- based\napproaches can predict the severity of the variant-induced splicing defects, underlining the\nquantitative character of these methods. It is possible that theΔtESRseq- andΔHZ\nEI-based\napproaches produced somewhat similar results because they both rely on the appreciation of\nhexamer sequences as ESRs. Interestingly, a correlation between ESRseq and ZEI scores has\nalready been reported [18] suggesting that most ESRs are indeed defined by 6-nucleotide\nstretches and that ESE sequences are more frequently represented in exons than in introns.\nContrary to our initial expectations,ΔC displayed the weakest predictive power out of the 3\nnew in silicotools dedicated to identifying ESR alterations. This was unexpected as this method\nhad been validated by using a large set of previously published splicing data, such as data on a\nplethora ofMLH1 nucleotide variants [19]. Close inspection of the validation set used on that\nstudy revealed a large excess of intronic variants relative to exonic changes, and also a consider-\nable under-representation of known ESR-mutations relative to the total number of variants\nincluded in the dataset. Most of the positive predictions reported forΔC [\n19] thus correspond\nto intronic mutations directly affecting splice sites. This may explain why we detected an excess\nof true negative calls relative to true positive calls when usingΔC-values for predicting ESR-\nmutations in the five datasets analyzed in this study, and suggests that theΔC-based method\nmay be overall suitable for predicting mutations directly modifying splice sites but not entirely\nreliable for predicting those affecting ESRs. In sum, our findings suggest that bothΔtESRseq-\nand ΔHZ\nEI-, based approaches can be used to stratify exonic variants for functional testing, and\nthat this strategy may help identifying disease-causing variants. We cannot exclude thatΔC-\nvalues may be useful in particular conditions and, conversely, that theΔtESRseq- andΔHZEI-,\nbased approaches may not be suitable for the analysis of certain exons or genes.\nIn the case ofMLH1, it is clear that severe exon 10 skipping causes Lynch syndrome\n(reviewed in [27]). Skipping ofMLH1 exon 10 leads to a shifted reading frame, resulting in a\npremature stop codon in exon 11 (MLH1 p.His264Leufs/C32) and probable degradation of the\naberrant transcripts by NMD. Variants inducing total exon 10 skipping cause a drastic loss in\nFL MLH1 protein and are therefore considered deleterious. In contrast, the clinical significance\nof variants inducing partial exon 10 skipping is still unknown. First, it is unclear if the amount\nof FL transcripts produced in the presence of such variants is enough to fulfillMLH1 function.\nSecond, it is possible that remaining FLMLH1 transcripts carrying missense variants lead to\nproduction of nonfunctional proteins. Additional analyses are thus necessary to determine the\nbiological and clinical significance of partial exon skipping-variants, including protein assays,\nassessment of patient clinical history and family data. Given that exon 10 codes for part of an\nimportant domain of the MLH1 protein (interaction with MUTSα)[\n40], we suspect that SNVs\nincreasing exon 10 inclusion can either have a protective impact if co-occurring with variants\nshowing the opposite effect, or a deleterious effect if introducing a missense change that\nseverely impairs protein function. Thus, in the absence of further information,MLH1 missense\nSNVs inducing exon 10 inclusion, as well as those not affecting splicing, should be considered\nas variants of unknown significance (VUS). In contrast, the clinical classification of synony-\nmous substitutions not affecting RNA splicing can eventually evolve from VUS to likely not\npathogenic depending on expert panel assessment [\n22,23].\nIn conclusion, our results revealed an unexpected high number of splicing mutations in the\nexon 10 ofMLH1, most of which affecting potential ESRs, and confirmed the predictive power\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 16 / 26\nof ΔtESRseq- andΔHZEI-based approaches for pinpointing this type of mutations, at least in\nMLH1 exon 10,BRCA2 exon 7,BRCA1 exon 6,CFTR exon 12 andNF1 exon 37. In principle,\nthe bioinformatics methods described in our study are amenable to automation and, as such,\nhave the potential to be used as filtering tools for identifying disease-causing candidates among\nthe large number of variants detected by high-throughput DNA sequencing.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics statement\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all individuals.\nRetrieval ofMLH1 exon 10 variants\nWe collected all SNVs reported in the exon 10 ofMLH1, until January 2013, by interrogating\nthe following public databases: UMD-MLH1 (Universal Mutation Database-MLH1,http://\nwww.umd.be/MLH1/)[ 22], LOVD (Leiden Open Variation Database,http://chromium.liacs.\nnl/LOVD2/colon_cancer/variants.php?select_db=MLH1), dbSNP (the Single Nucleotide Poly-\nmorphism databasehttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/), and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (the\nEuropean protein sequence database,http://swissvar.expasy.org/cgi-bin/swissvar/result?\nglobal_textfield=MLH1)( Table 1and Fig 1A).\nNomenclature\nNucleotide numbering is based on the cDNA sequence ofMLH1 (NCBI accession number\nNM_000249.3), c.1 denoting the first nucleotide of the translation initiation codon, as recom-\nmended by the Human Genome Variation Society.\nSplicing minigene reporter assays\nIn order to evaluate the impact on splicing of eachMLH1 exon 10 variant, we performed func-\ntional assays based on the comparative analysis of the splicing pattern of wild-type and mutant\nMLH1 reporter minigenes. These minigenes were prepared by using two different vectors:\npSPL3m and pCAS2. The pSPL3m plasmid, a modified version of the exon-trapping vector\npSPL3 (Invitrogen) which in turn derives from pSPL1 [\n41], carries two chimeric exons (here\nnamed I and II, both containing rabbitβ-globin and HIVTat sequences) separated by an intron\ncontaining BamHI and MluI cloning sites (Fig 1B)[ 13]. Expression of the pSPL3m minigene is\ndriven by the SV40 promoter. The pCAS2 vector carries two exons (here named A and B) with a\nsequence derived from the humanSERPING1/C1NH gene, separated by an intron with BamHI\nand MluI cloning sites (S2A Fig). Expression of the pCAS2 minigene is under the control of a\nCMV promoter. The pCAS2 is a modified version of the previously described pCAS1 plasmid\n[13,42]. Two modifications were introduced into the exon A of pCAS2 relative to pCAS1: (i) the\nfirst 114 bp of exon A were deleted, and (ii) theSERPING1/CINH translation initiation codon\nwas disrupted by replacing the sequence GATG (initiation codon underlined) by TCAC.\nThe wild-type genomic fragmentMLH1 c.791-168_c.884+187 (MLH1 exon 10 and flanking\nintronic sequences) was inserted into the BamHI and MluI cloning sites of the reporter plas-\nmids pSPL3m and pCAS2, yielding the three-exon hybrid minigenes pSPL3m-M1e10 and\npCAS2-M1e10, respectively (Figs\n1B and S2A). Minigenes carryingMLH1 exon 10 variants\nwere prepared by site-directed mutagenesis by using the two-stage overlap extension PCR\nmethod [\n43] and the wild-type pSPL3m-M1e10 construct as template. Then, the mutant ampli-\ncons were digested with BamHI and MluI, and introduced into BamHI and MluI cloning sites\nof the pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene to replace the wild-type fragment. The inserts of all constructs\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 17 / 26\nwere sequenced to ensure that no other mutations had been introduced during the cloning pro-\ncess. In some cases, as indicated (S2 Fig), mutant inserts were digested from the pSPL3m-\nM1e10 minigene with BamHI and MluI and then subcloned into pCAS2.\nNext, wild-type and mutant minigenes (1μg/well) were transfected in parallel into HeLa\ncells grown at ~60% confluence in 6-well plates using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent\n(Roche Applied Science). HeLa cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium\n(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C.\nTotal RNA was extracted 24 hours after transfection using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit\n(Macherey Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the minigene transcripts\nwere analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (30 cycles of amplification) in a 25μl reaction vol-\nume by using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), 100 ng total RNA, and pSPL3m- or pCA-\nS2-appropriate forward and reverse primers (SD6 and SA2 or pCAS-KO1-F and pCAS-2-R,\nrespectively, as described in [\n13] and [37]). RT-PCR products were separated by electrophore-\nsis on 2.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and visualized by exposure to ultraviolet\nlight under non-saturating conditions using the Gel Doc XR image acquisition system (Bio-\nRAD). Semi-quantitative analysis, gel extraction and sequencing of the RT-PCR products were\ncarried out as previously described [\n42].\nESR-dependent minigene reporter assay\nMLH1 exon 10 fragments (~30 bp-long) were analyzed for their splicing enhancer properties\nby performing a functional assay based on the splicing pattern of the pcDNA-Dup minigene\n[\n13]. This vector contains aβ-globin-derived three-exon minigene with a middle exon particu-\nlarly sensitive to the presence of exonic splicing regulatory signals. Expression of the minigene\nis under the control of the CMV promoter (Fig 2B). The exonic fragments of interest, wild-\ntype or mutant, were obtained by annealing complementary 5’-phosphorylated oligonucleo-\ntides carrying 5’-EcoRI and 3’-BamHI compatible ends. Then, the exonic segments were\ninserted into the EcoRI and BamHI cloning sites of the middle exon of pcDNA-Dup to produce\nhybrid pcDNA-Dup-M1e10-R minigenes. All constructs were sequenced to ensure that no\nother mutations were introduced into the middle exon during the cloning process. Transfec-\ntion, RNA extraction and RT-PCR analysis were performed as described for the splicing mini-\ngene reporter assay except that RT-PCR reactions were performed with 150 ng total RNA as\ntemplate, T7-Pro (5’-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3’) and Dup-S4-Seq-3R (5’-CGTGCAG\nCTTGTCACAGTGC-3’) as forward and reverse primers respectively, and 28 cycles of amplifi-\ncation. RT-PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis as described above for the splicing\nminigene reporter assay.\nBioinformatics predictions of splice site-mutations\nThree in silicotools were used to predict variant-induced alterations in 3’and 5’splice site\nstrength, namely: SpliceSiteFinder-like (SSF,http://www.interactive-biosoftware.com), Max-\nEntScan (MES,http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/maxent/Xmaxentscan_scoreseq.html; Maximum\nEntropy Model) and the splice site module of Human Splicing Finder (here named HSF-ss for\nsplice site-dedicated HSF,\nhttp://www.umd.be/HSF/). These algorithms were interrogated\nsimultaneously by using the integrated software tool Alamut (Interactive Biosoftware, France,\nhttp://www.interactive-biosoftware.com), as previously described [17].\nBioinformatics predictions of ESR-mutations\nThree newly developedin silicoapproaches were used to predict variant-induced alterations in\nexonic splicing regulatory elements (ESRs): (i) calculation of total ESRseq score changes\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 18 / 26\n(ΔtESRseq) by using the method previously described by our group [17] with a small modifica-\ntion (here, only exonic positions were taken into account), (ii) calculation ofΔHZEI values by\nusing the HEXplorer method [18], and (iii) assignment ofΔC values based on the Splicing Reg-\nulatory Model (http://tools.genes.toronto.edu) recently described by Xiong and co-workers\n[19]. Moreover, as indicated, we also resorted to three previously established ESR-dedicatedin\nsilico tools: (i) EX-SKIP (http://ex-skip.img.cas.cz/)[ 29] in which we took into account the full\nnucleotide sequence of the exon of interest, (ii) ESEfinder (http://rulai.cshl.edu/cgi-bin/tools/\nESE3/esefinder.cgi?process=home)[ 30,31], and (iii) the ESR module of Human Splicing Finder\n(here named HSF-SR for ESR-dedicated HSF,http://www.umd.be/HSF3/)[ 32].\nStatistical analysis\nResults are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. Data derived from\ncomparisons of experimental andin silicoanalyses were compared by using either the one-way\nANOVA test or the Student’s t-test, and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient, as indicated.\nMore specifically, the ANOVA test was used for assessing the performance of the bioinformat-\nics tools in discriminating 3 groups of variants (i.e. variants that increase exon skipping versus\nthose with no effect on splicing versus those that increase exon inclusion), whereas Student’st -\ntest was used when only 2 groups of variants were taken into account (i.e. variants that increase\nexon skipping versus those that do not). Correlation between exon inclusion levels andin silico\npredictions was measured by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients (r). p-values and r are\nindicated in the figures. Results were considered significant when p-value<0.05. Statistical\ntests were performed by using BiostaTGV (\nhttp://marne.u707.jussieu.fr/biostatgv/).\nThe power to distinguish mutations that induce exon skipping from those that do not was\nfurther assessed, for each ESR-dedicatedin silicomethod, by calculating sensitivity and speci-\nficity values (true positives x 100/(true positives + false negatives) and (true negatives x 100/\n(true negatives + false positives), respectively). Sensitivity and specificity were determined by\ntaking into account the following thresholds: -0.5 forΔtESRseq (arbitrary threshold), -20 for\nΔHZ\nEI (arbitrary threshold), and -0.05 forΔC (threshold previously established by the\nauthors, [19].\nAnalysis of the splicing pattern ofMLH1 in peripheral blood samples and\nlymphoblastoid cell lines of patients and controls\nPeripheral blood samples were directly collected into PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (Qiagen)\nfrom which total RNA was extracted by using the PAXgene Blood RNA kit, according to the\nmanufacturer’s instructions. EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were culti-\nvated in RPMI medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2 mM of L-glutamine and 10%\nfetal calf serum, at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Before RNA extraction, LCLs were trans-\nferred into 6-well plates, at 2.5x106 cells/well, and incubated for 5.5 hours with/without 200μg/\nml puromycin. Then, total RNA was extracted by using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey\nNagel). Written informed consent was obtained from all individuals.\nThe splicing pattern ofMLH1 transcripts expressed in peripheral blood and in LCLs was\nanalyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in 25μl-final\nvolume reactions containing 100 ng of total RNA, a forward primer located inMLH1 exon 8\n(MLH1-RT-8Fbis, 5’-AAGGAGAGACAGTAGCTGATGTT-3’) and a reverse primer located\nin exon 12 (MLH1-12R, 5’-TGCTCAGAGGCTGCAGAAA-3’). To ensure that the assay was\nin the linear range, RT-PCR reactions were performed with 34 cycles of amplification (S4 Fig).\nThen, RT-PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel, gel-purified\nand sequenced.\nExonic Splicing Mutations Are Currently Underestimated\nPLOS Genetics | DOI:10.1371/journal.pgen.1005756 January 13, 2016 19 / 26\nAllele specific expression analysis\nAllele specific expression (ASE) was measured by performing a SNaPshot assay (ABI Prism\nSNaPshot, Fig 5B). First, RT-PCR products spanningMLH1 exons 8 to 12 were obtained, as\ndescribed above, from a peripheral blood RNA sample of a patient carrying the heterozygous\nc.793C>T substitution inMLH1 exon 10 (Patient P\n793CT.1). In parallel, a segment encompass-\ning MLH1 exon 10 was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of the same patient by using\nthe Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, PCR\nreactions (35 cycles of amplification) were performed in a final volume of 25μl with 100 ng of\ngenomic DNA as template, a forward primer inMLH1 intron 9 (MLH1-10-Bam-F, 5’-\nGACCGGATCCTTGGAAAGTGGCGACAGG-3’) and a reverse primer in intron 10 (MLH1-\n10-Mlu-R, 5’-GACCACGCGTAATTAGTGAATAAATGAAGGAAAA-3’). Then, 5μl aliquots\nof RT-PCR and PCR products were treated with one unit of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase\n(SAP, USB) and 8 units of Exonuclease I (Thermo Scientific) in the presence of SAP buffer in a\nfinal volume of 10μl. After 1 hour at 37°C, the reactions were terminated by incubating at 75°C\nfor 15 minutes. Next, 2μl aliquots of treated RT-PCR and PCR products were subjected to\nSNaPshot reactions, in a final volume of 10μl, by using the SNaPshot Multiplex Kit (Applied\nBiosystems) and a reverse primer targeting the sequence immediately downstreamMLH1\nc.793C>T (SNAP-M1.793-R, 5’-GGAAGTTGATTCTACCAGAC-3’). SNaPshot reactions\nwere carried out by performing 25 cycles of primer extension (denaturation at 96°C for 10 sec,\nannealing at 50°C for 5 sec and elongation at 60°C for 30 sec). Next, the reactions were incu-\nbated with 1 unit of SAP at 37°C for 1 hour, and terminated at 75°C for 15 minutes. Finally, the\nextension products were separated by electrophoresis and analyzed quantitatively by using an\nABI PRISM-3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). SNaPshot results obtained from\npatient cDNA were normalized by those obtained from gDNA.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Fig. Description of the RT-PCR products obtained in the pSPL3m-M1e10 minigene\nsplicing reporter assay.(A) Comparative RT-PCR analysis of the splicing patterns of wild-\ntype and mutant pSPL3m-M1e10 minigenes, as indicated.
