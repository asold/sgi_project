Using hardware platforms combined with other paradigms stimulates\nlearning and has become an apparent trend in education. The Multi-Agent Sys-\ntems domain studies the use of autonomous entities to solve complex problems.\nWhen combined with the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI), a cognitive model close\nto human thinking, it can contribute to facilitating the teaching of Artificial In-\ntelligence (AI) and Computational Thinking (CT). This work presents a toolkit\nto support the teaching of AI supported by BDI intelligent agents using a pro-\ntotyping approach. Four workshops were held at different levels, and a techno-\nlogical acceptance questionnaire was designed to analyze the proposed toolkit.\n1. Introduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) concepts have been presented as a motivating element for\nComputational Thinking (CT) practices in the classroom. The integration between AI\nand CT tends to cooperate to construct knowledge, simplifying abstraction and algo-\nrithmic thinking, especially in high school classes [Caruso and Cavalheiro 2021]. One\nof the fields of AI is Intelligent Agents, which are virtual or physical entities, autono-\nmous, endowed with cognitive abilities, social ability, and adaptability to adverse situa-\ntions. Such agents can be part of a Multi-agent System (MAS), where intelligent agents\ncoexist in pursuit of their individual and collective goals, whether mutual or conflic-\nting [Wooldridge 2009].\nOver time, cognitive models that try to understand the functioning of human\nreasoning have been studied in sociology and philosophy. Remarkably, the Belief-\nDesire-Intention model (BDI) [Bratman 1987] models the functioning of the human\npsyche through its beliefs, desires, and intentions in practical reasoning. It descri-\nbes how the experience and knowledge obtained from social interactions and with the\nworld can influence decision-making, reflected in a chain of plans and actions to achi-\neve individual goals. Technologically, there are frameworks for developing intelligent\nagents that allow applications in different domains to be created, such as community\n[Pereira dos Santos et al. 2016], biology [Souza de Jesus. et al. 2021], social modeling\n[Rocha Costa 2022], among others.\nThe BDI model adds a cognition layer closer to human thinking to software and\nhardware computational entities. Educationally, a BDI agent-based approach allows abs-\ntractions such as beliefs and intentions to be used in constructing computational entities.\nIt can lead to a natural learning of the process of building intelligent applications, as the\nstudent can understand the reasoning from explaining how he does it in the real world.\nTeaching supported by hardware platforms (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) is beco-\nming a technological learning trend that contributes to improving the teaching-learning\nprocess, promoting proactive thinking in the classroom, and training students in the\nsearch for solutions to real-world problems [Korom and Ill ´es 2022, Nov ´ak et al. 2018,\nAl-Masri et al. 2020]. Allied with this, adopting emerging technologies in the applica-\ntion of project-based learning, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber-physical sys-\ntems, and ubiquitous computing, among others, contribute to the cohesion and intersec-\ntion of computing with other areas [Al-Masri et al. 2020]. However, regarding solutions\nthat support embedding MAS in hardware, there is still a lack of an integrated tool that\nfacilitates the teaching and development of applications supported by intelligent agents\n[Brand˜ao et al. 2021].\nWithin this scenario, this work aims to present a proposal of a toolkit applied\nto teaching of AI supported by BDI intelligent agents using a prototyping approach. The\napproach consists of programming technologies to support the development of Embedded\nMAS and a teaching methodology mixing theory and practice. Our philosophy relays on\nthe ability to add cognition to collaborative networked devices —Cognitive Hardware On\nNetwork (Chon). The toolkit comprises an operating system distribution, a development\ninterface, a middleware IoT, and a standard prototype architecture. Five workshops were\nheld to analyze the toolkit and the methodology: three in scientific workshops, one during\nan undergraduate class in an Information Systems course, and the last during a master’s\nclass in Computing. A Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire was applied\nto analyze the participants’ responses regarding the acceptance of the proposed toolkit.\nThis work is structured as follows: some related works are presented in Section 2;\nSection 3 presents the toolkit proposed in this paper; the experiments and the results of\nthe toolkit evaluation are presented in Section 4; Finally, the conclusions are presented in\nSection 5.\n2. Related works\nThere are several approaches to promoting CT and teaching AI and agents by adopting\nhardware and robotic platforms. For example, Frankie [Pimentel et al. 2018] is an intel-\nligent robot used in Educational Robotics activities to present AI concepts and intelligent\nagents to high school students. The approach is divided into two steps: in the first, stu-\ndents train the robot to recognize pre-established figures; in the second, the robot runs on a\nplayful carpet with several possible destinations, where students must present images for\nthe robot to recognize the path to follow. A motor, a display, an ultrasonic sensor, a line\nfollower, and a camera are used in the hardware layer. The firmware layer uses the Ar-\nduino Mega 2560. The interface layer uses serial communication via Python commands.\nThe reasoning layer is hosted on a Single-Board Computer (SBC) Raspberry Pi and uses\na neural network to interpret figures that indicate what to do next in the environment.\nRobotic platforms that integrate agents, including educational solutions, usually\nuse a four-layer architecture (hardware, firmware, serial communication, and reasoning)\nto interconnect the reasoning of high-level cognitive models to control physical devi-\nces of hardware to try to abstract user intervention in these layers [Pantoja et al. 2016,\nOnyedinma et al. 2020, Silva et al. 2020]. From the student’s perspective, the greater the\ntechnical abstractions at the structural level, the tendency for the CT learning process to\nbe optimized. For example, in the case of Frankie, the student needs to carry out manual\ntraining directly on Raspberry, requiring prior knowledge of operating systems besides\nAI structures. Similarly, the student only has access to this system in a wired way when\nphysically connecting a monitor. Ideally, the student should focus on AI and CT in the\nlearning process, and the architectural and technological integration issues should be abs-\ntracted during the teaching process.\nThe Multi-agent System for non-Holonomic Racing (MuSHR) is a full-stack robo-\ntic platform applied in AI and Mobile Robot classes at undergraduate and graduate levels,\nwhich uses rapid prototyping techniques acting on all layers [Srinivasa et al. 2019]. A\nVESC Driver hosts the firmware layer. In the Interface layer, messages from the Robot\nOperating System (ROS) are used, and the reasoning layer is hosted on an Nvidia Jet-\nson Nano. Although the educational prototype is standardized, abstracting some levels of\nstudent intervention (hardware and interfacing), technical and specialized knowledge in\ncertain technologies is still required. Highly specialized technologies are excellent can-\ndidates for teaching support tools at the undergraduate and graduate levels. When the\ntoolkit is intended to be applied at Elementary, Technical, and High School levels, the\nneed for prior knowledge or the learning curve of such technologies can muddle the AI\nlearning process. It may cause disinterest due to the delay in achieving results or require\nhigh student commitment.\nBesides, other initiatives for teaching AI and BDI that do not use hardware exist.\nOne example is Edubot [Lima et al. 2018], a serious game that, through the Problem-\nBased Learning approach, enables the practice of concepts of intelligent agents from the\nAI class of a bachelor’s degree course. In it, the player must program the agent’s action\nlogic according to the availability of sensors and logical actuators. The first phase requires\nthe student to program an agent using conditional rules based on the agent’s perceptions to\navoid contact with moving obstacles in the scenario. The other phase requires the student\nto map the scenario and build a model where the agent, when finding an object, must\nreturn to the initial position, avoiding contact with static obstacles. Edubot abstracts the\nentire structural part of the student, providing a simulated panel displaying the steps that\nagents perform dynamically. It allows the student to focus on the development activities\nof the agent’s reasoning layer. However, in practical experimentation with 22 students,\na previous study of the syntax of the Python language was recommended, which uses\ntraditional algorithms and object orientation structures.\nFinally, using cognitive models like the BDI, an IDE [Burattini et al. 2022] pre-\nsents a visual programming approach, allowing students with no experience in agent-\noriented programming to develop autonomous systems. Each agent is composed of an\ninitial block and a library of plans. The initial block defines the initial beliefs and plans\nto which the agent is committed. Each agent’s plan is constructed and stored in sepa-\nrate blocks, forming the agent’s procedural knowledge library. Visual tools based on\nbuilding the CT by composing blocks have been successful at different educational le-\nvels [Queiroz et al. 2019]. Nevertheless, the expected result of applying block approa-\nches to AI thinking supported by agents tends to be positive, but it still lacks tool support\nto deal with embedded systems.\n3. Proposal of a toolkit for teaching AI supported by robotic-agents\nThis section will present the technological toolkit for teaching AI and intelligent agents\nembedded in robotic platforms to act at different levels of education. It abstracts the\nstudent’s intervention at technological levels to facilitate the learning process. However,\ndepending on the educational level, it still leaves the possibility of intervention for the\nteacher or professor to decide.\nThe toolkit aims to make the learning process of the concepts of autonomous and\ncognitive agents practically and tangibly feasible. It includes a GNU/Linux distribution\nthat integrates several solutions to abstract technological dependencies; a development\nenvironment; an agent-oriented programming language adapted to control hardware; a\ncommunication infrastructure using IoT, and standardized models of low-cost prototypes.\nIn this scenario, the student can use a computer with the development environment\nfor programming cognition and send it remotely to the prototypes without needing a phy-\nsical wired connection or disassembly. With the toolkit’s support, the student can program\nthe interaction between the prototypes using the IoT. However, the students do not need\nto know the technical details. The student can focus on the reasoning layer with stan-\ndardized prototype models. Furthermore, if want, the student can program the firmware\nlayer too. It allows flexibility of the toolkit for various educational purposes, supporting\nthe production of CT in AI and the programming of robotic platforms. Figure 1 presents\nthe interconnection of all tools in an educational environment.\nFigura 1. Use of Chon toolkit for practical teaching of intelligent agents.\nUsing the development environment (ChonIDE), the student can program the rea-\nsoning of the prototypes (ChonBots) remotely through a wi-fi connection. These prototy-\npes can collaborate to perform complex tasks through the IoT network (ChonNet). The\nhardware of the prototypes is standardized to facilitate the manipulation and learning of\nAI. It executes a specific-purpose operating system to support the development of these\nactivities (ChonOS). Technologically described below are each of the components of the\ntoolkit:\n• ChonBots: Chon - Basic Prototypes ( http://bots.chon.group/) are low-\ncost prototype models for Embedded MAS. They comprise an SBC, a prototyping\nplatform, sensors, and actuators. Each model has a list of supported actions so\nthat a robotic agent (thinking layer) could manage the prototype. In addition, the\nschematics from the hardware layer, the source code from the firmware layer, and\nthe library from the interface layer are provided. Figures 2a, 2b and 2c present\nthe schematic, a 2WD prototype built, and the list of actions still supported. The\nprototype had light, distance, and line-follower sensors. The actuators are LED,\nbuzzer, and 2WD robotic platform.\n(a) Schematic.\n (b) Prototype.\n(c) Supported Actions and\nPerceptions.\nFigura 2. Schematic, prototype, actions and perceptions of the ChonBot 2WD.\n• ChonOS: Chon - Operational System (http://os.chon.group/) is a specific-\npurpose GNU/Linux distribution for Embedded MAS. It uses Jason Embedded,\nan extended version [Bordini and H ¨ubner 2006] of an AgentSpeak(L) language\n[Rao 1996] interpreter, to enable agents to control embedded systems, commu-\nnicability, and mobility over an IoT infrastructure. This distribution facilitates\ndevice configuration; loading the firmware and reasoning; and Embedded MAS\nmanagement (start, stop, or debug). All these functionalities are carried out remo-\ntely without disassembling or turning off the prototype. In the first run, ChonOS\nstarts a Wi-Fi Hotspot where the teacher has access to the configuration panel to\ndefine a name for the prototype and include it in a nearby wireless local network.\n• ChonIDE: Chon - Integrated Development Environment (http://ide.chon.\ngroup/) is a development environment for the firmware and reasoning layers\nof the Embedded MAS. The student can develop, send, start, or stop\nthe execution of reasoning and develop, compile, or deploy the firmware\n[Souza de Jesus et al. 2022]. The development environment can be installed and\nexecuted on a computer, transmitting the software for execution on the prototype,\nor accessed directly via a mobile phone or browser.\n• ChonNet: Chon - Network Services (http://net.chon.group/) is a layer\nof cloud services that implements a dynamic device name update architec-\nture [Lu and Liu 2009] and a context services architecture for collaborative, per-\nvasive, and large-scale applications [Endler et al. 2011]. ChonNet facilitates the\nmanagement and development of the prototypes because even if it moves through\ndifferent networks, the connection is made by mnemonics (robot name) instead of\na network address that can change each time it is used. Furthermore, it enables\ncommunication protocols [Souza de Jesus. et al. 2021] between intelligent agents\nfrom different Embedded MAS, as it assigns a universal identifier, allowing IoT\ncommunication inside or outside the local network.\nAll the technical details of the toolkit are abstracted from the student, who needs\nto focus only on learning AI and their allowed reflection on how cognitive models thought\nof in human thinking can be used to generate computational entities with the autonomous\ncapacity to control. It is possible to explore teaching methodologies applied at different\neducational levels by simplifying access to technical tools. At levels such as undergra-\nduate and graduate, it is evident, given the diverse previous educational experiences, that\nthere is an application and facilitation of learning. However, a smaller learning curve is\nexpected on another educational level, given the possibility of the student performing the\nCT using a cognitive model close to human thinking.\n3.1. AI teaching approach supported by robotic agents\nA practical approach contributes to transforming theoretical concepts into examples of\neasy assimilation, stimulates learning, increases commitment, and improves interaction\nin the classroom [Fernandes et al. 2018]. This section presents a method that seeks to\nenable the teaching of AI supported by using intelligent agents in a practical approach.\nFigure 3 presents the proposed approach with six steps, from the conceptualiza-\ntion of AI and IoT to the development of integrated cognitive systems. Each step of the\napproach is described below:\nFigura 3. Teaching AI supported by robotic agents.\n1. Introduction: Initially, introductory concepts about the different paradigms that\nenable the development of projects for embedded cognitive systems and their\nlayers are presented. The practical activity in this step involves installing Cho-\nnIDE on the student’s computer and running the hello world. The objective is for\nthe student to learn to use the development environment, consult the MAS logs,\nand inspect the mind of a BDI agent.\n2. Agent: The second step presents concepts about intelligent agents, BDI architec-\nture, and the AgentSpeak(L) language. The hands-on activity involves program-\nming a reactive agent. The goal is for the student to be able to manipulate the\nbeliefs, goals, and plans of a BDI agent.\n3. Multi-agent: This step presents the concepts of the BDI agent’s reasoning cycle\nand the communication between agents of the same system. The practical activity\ninvolves programming a MAS with two agents that share beliefs and plans. The\nobjective is for the student to know the BDI agent’s communication.\n4. Communicator: The fourth step presents concepts about communication between\ndifferent multi-agent systems through IoT communication middleware. The prac-\ntical activity, preferably in pairs, involves programming two MAS who share beli-\nefs and plans. The objective is for the student to know the communication between\ndifferent MAS.\n5. Mobile: Later, the concepts of mobile agents and Open MAS are presented. The\npractical activity, preferably performed in pairs, involves programming two MAS\nthat allow agents to enter and exit. The objective is for the student to know bio-\ninspired communication protocols for agents.\n6. Embedded: Finally, concepts about robotic agents, actions, and perceptions of\nthe environment are presented. The practical activity preferably carried out in\npairs, involves installing or configuring ChonOS and programming two MAS, one\ncapable of handling the prototype (previously built) and another that requests the\nexecution of tasks. The objective is to enable the student to program embedded\ncognitive systems.\n4. Workshops\nWe performed five workshops to evaluate the toolkit use and the proposed approach. Th-\nree are offered as a mini-course, and two during a regular course. The first workshop was\nheld during the XVI Workshop-School on Agents, Environments and Applications (WE-\nSAAC 2022), held at UFSC in Blumenau. The audience was mostly made up of specialists\nin the field of MAS. The objective was to analyze the acceptance of using the proposed\ntoolkit for Embedded MAS and gather suggestions for improvements. ChonIDE was in\nthe alpha version during the first edition, allowing only the upload and deployment of the\nreasoning and firmware layers. It was still necessary to code the MAS in an additional\neditor, zip the project folder and send it to the prototype.\nThe objective of the last four workshops was to analyze the improvements made\n(ChonIDE beta version) in the toolkit and gather feedback from students. The second\nworkshop was held during a Scientific Workshop at UTFPR in Ponta Grossa. The au-\ndience was primarily undergraduate and graduate students with experience in MAS. The\nthird workshop was held during a class on Multi-agent Systems at the Institute of Com-\nputing at UFF. The audience consisted of graduate students in their first contact with\nMAS. The fourth workshop was held during a class on Specialist Systems for the bache-\nlor’s degree in Information Systems at Cefet/RJ. The audience consisted of undergraduate\nstudents in their first contact with MAS. The last workshop was at IFSP in Campos do\nJord˜ao with undergraduate, technical, and high school students and too last-grade students\nin elementary school, everyone in their first contact with MAS.\n4.1. Acceptance of the proposed tollkit\nA test using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was applied to evaluate the use of\nthe toolkit. The questionnaire1 was performed anonymously and online after the comple-\ntion of the workshop. We sought to analyze the participant’s profiles on their performance\nlevel, familiarity with the agent-oriented paradigm compared to other paradigms, and ex-\nperience in development. We sought to assess: acceptance of the command and firmware\nlayer management functionalities; the usability perception of the toolkit; and finally, the\nintention to use the toolkit.\nThe results of the profile are as follows: 100% of the interviewees knew program-\nming and the object-oriented paradigm; 75% knew of the agent-oriented paradigm; 87%\nalready had some experience with embedded systems; finally, 63% already had experi-\nence with multi-agent and embedded multi-agent systems.\n1http://csbc23.chon.group - presentations and photos of the workshops are also available.\nFigura 4. Level of experience in programming paradigm and development know-\nhow of workshop participants.\nAbout the toolkit functionalities, the respondents: 100% strongly agreed that the\nUPLOAD functionalities, Boards and libraries management, compilation, and firmware\ndeployment facilitate the development; 100% agreed that MAS code editor, Mind Ins-\npector, and MAS Log make development easier. 85% agree that remotely starting and\nstopping MAS facilitates development.\nAbout the perception of the use: 100% strongly agree that using the toolkit facili-\ntates the development process, and 100% agree that the usability is easy, and they learned\nto use ChonIDE easily. About the intention of use: 87% strongly agree that they would\nuse the toolkit daily; Finally, 100% strongly agree that they would recommend using it.\nFigura 5. Acceptance results about the proposed tool kit.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper presented a set of tools for teaching AI using intelligent agents embedded in\nrobotic platforms. The toolkit makes it possible to abstract the need for student interven-\ntion in technological parts. The toolkit consists of a GNU/Linux distribution, an IDE,\nan IoT communication service, a teaching methodology, and low-cost prototype models.\nCurrently, the toolkit has been validated by users with experience in agent-oriented pro-\ngramming and by undergraduate and graduate users. The results were positive, and it is\nbelieved that this practical approach can facilitate teaching AI to students at other levels\nof education.\nFuture works may evaluate the use of the toolkit in teaching AI in high\nschool/technical students’ classes. In addition, can address educational aspects and te-\nachers’ perceptions of using the toolkit. Another possibility is evaluating the tool’s usabi-\nlity integrated with other classes, such as robotics and networks.\nReferˆencias\nAl-Masri, E., Kabu, S., and Dixith, P. (2020).
