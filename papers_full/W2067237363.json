Faithful social learning of incremental improvements in technique is considered to be a\ndefining feature of human culture, differentiating human from non-human cultures. This study presents the first\nexperimental evidence for chimpanzees’ social transmission of a more efficient tool-use technique invented by a conspecific\ngroup member.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: The chimpanzees were provided with a straw-tube, and spontaneously demonstrated\ntwo different techniques in obtaining juice through a small hole: ‘‘dipping’’ and ‘‘straw-sucking’’. Both the ‘‘dipping’’ and\n‘‘straw-sucking’’ techniques depended on the use of the same tool (straw-tube) for the same target (juice) accessible from\nexactly the same location (small hole 1 cm in diameter). Therefore the difference between ‘‘dipping’’ and ‘‘straw-sucking’’\nwas only in ‘‘technique’’. Although the two techniques differed significantly in their efficiency, their cognitive and\nperceptuo-motor complexity were comparable. All five chimpanzees who initially performed the ‘‘dipping’’ technique\nswitched to using the more efficient ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique upon observing a conspecific or human demonstrate the\nmore proficient alternate ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique.\nConclusions/Significance: The social learning mechanism involved here was clearly not local or stimulus enhancement, but\nimitation or emulation of a tool-use technique. When there is no biologically relevant difference in cognitive or perceptuo-\nmotor complexity between two techniques, and when chimpanzees are dissatisfied with their own technique, chimpanzees\nmay socially learn an improved technique upon close observation of a proficient demonstrator. This study provides\nimportant insights into the cognitive basis for cumulative culture in chimpanzees, and also suggests possible conditions in\nwhich cumulative cultural evolution could arise even in non-human animals.\nCitation: Yamamoto S, Humle T, Tanaka M (2013) Basis for Cumulative Cultural Evolution in Chimpanzees: Social Learning of a More Efficient Tool-Use\nTechnique.

Candidate examples of culture\nacross the animal kingdom have been accumulating incrementally\nover the course of the past two decades [1–3]. However, many\nargue that humans are still unique in their capacity for cumulative\ncultural evolution, with successive generations building on earlier\nachievements [4–7]. This process depends upon faithful, high\nfidelity social transmission of improved, more efficient techniques.\nIn humans, imitation and teaching are viewed as the key processes\nunderlying cumulative cultural evolution and some researchers\nargue that these social learning mechanisms are absent or rare in\nnon-human cultures [8–9].\nChimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives, display in the\nwild not only an array of different tool-use types but also tool-use\ntechniques that vary among communities [10–12]. For example,\nwhen ant-dipping and gathering army ants ( Dorylus sp.) off a tool,\nchimpanzees may exhibit one of two techniques: ‘‘direct mouth-\ning’’ which involves the chimpanzee passing the tool through its\nlips, and ‘‘pull-through’’ which requires the chimpanzee to swipe\nthe length of or a portion of the wand with its free hand.\nChimpanzees in Taı¨,C oˆte d’Ivoire, rely predominantly on the\n‘‘direct mouthing’’ technique [13], while in Gombe, Tanzania, the\nmajority of chimpanzees demonstrate the ‘‘pull-through’’ tech-\nnique [14], although Bossou chimpanzees in Guinea exhibit both\n[11,15]. Although tool length does to some extent explain these\ndifferences, variations in technique cannot solely be accounted for\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e55768\nby tool length attributes alone [16–17]. In addition, Goualougo\nchimpanzees in the Congo employ a tool set when targeting army\nant nests; they use a woody tool to perforate the nest and then a\nmore slender probing tool or wand to dip for the ants [18]. The\nuse of a tool set in this context is thought to improve harvesting\nefficiency and prey exploitation over longer periods of time.\nCumulative innovation in techniques is also suggested from\nobservational and archaeological studies on chimpanzee nut-\ncracking [10,19–20]. Complex techniques in nut-cracking involv-\ning the use of a wedge stone [21] are also plausible examples of\ncumulative culture. However, the mechanisms of acquisition and\ndiffusion of these differing techniques are still not fully understood.\nIt remains to be examined how this variation in tool-use\ntechniques emerges and how it is maintained within communities\n[22]. Although chimpanzees can learn socially a variety of\nbehaviors including tool-use [23–25], the social learning mecha-\nnisms involved can sometimes be described parsimoniously as\nsimple local or stimulus enhancement. Social learning of improved\ntool-use techniques requires more sophisticated mechanisms, since\nindividuals have to differentiate two techniques which target the\nsame goal at the same location and also involve reliance upon the\nsame tool. Previous experimental studies have revealed that\nchimpanzees can socially learn different techniques [26–29].\nHowever, while most of these studies have focused on the social\ntransmission of behavioral techniques not involving tools [27–28],\nothers reported social learning of two optional tool-uses whose\nperformance differed in the target location of the tool-use action\n[29]. Based upon the strict criteria of same tool, same target, and\nsame location, there is to date little experimental evidence for\nsocial transmission of tool-use techniques in non-human animals,\neven in chimpanzees.\nIt is also unclear whether or not chimpanzees are able to switch\ntheir technique to a more efficient one via social learning.\nChimpanzees appear to be conservative when it comes to\nincorporating novel and more efficient techniques into their\nbehavioral repertoire. Captive studies suggest that when chim-\npanzees become proficient at employing a particular technique,\nthey stick to this technique even if given the opportunity to observe\nothers demonstrating an alternate more efficient technique [30–\n31]. Many researchers therefore consider that only humans are\ncognitively capable of cumulative cultural evolution. However,\nexperimental conditions or motivational factors may undermine\nthe chimpanzees’ abilities and performance. Here we present the\nfirst experimental evidence, to our knowledge, for chimpanzees’\nsocial learning of a more efficient tool-use technique in an intuitive\ntool-use situation, suggesting that the limitation for chimpanzees’\ncumulative cultural evolution might be due to ecological, social,\nand motivational factors rather than cognitive inabilities per se.\nResults and Discussion\nWe tested nine captive chimpanzees at the Primate Research\nInstitute, Kyoto University. Each participant was provided with an\n18 cm-long silicon straw-tube. This tube could be used as a tool to\nobtain juice contained in a bottle externally fixed to the panel wall\nof the experimental booth, and accessible via a small hole (1 cm in\ndiameter). In a pre-test examination, four of the nine chimpanzees\nperformed the ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique, while the other five\nadopted the ‘‘dipping’’ technique (Figure 1; Movie S1). The\n‘‘dipping’’ technique was much less efficient than the ‘‘straw-\nsucking’’ technique. A chimpanzee participant could normally\ndrink up to 50 ml of juice contained in the bottle within 30 sec\n(.100 ml/min) when employing the ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique,\nwhile at most 20 ml during a 10 min trial ( ,2 ml/min) when\nemploying the ‘‘dipping’’ technique. ‘‘Dipping’’ participants failed\nto innovate the ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique by themselves when\ntested for 5 days individually, i.e., in the individual condition\n(10 min a day).\nWhen we paired each of the five ‘‘dipping’’ participants with a\n‘‘straw-sucking’’ conspecific non-kin demonstrator in the same\nbooth, four of the five participants subsequently adopted the\n‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique (Table 1). Those chimpanzees who\nmost closely and attentively observed the demonstrator perform\nthe alternate ‘straw-sucking’ technique switched more rapidly to\nusing the novel technique. In the paired condition, three of the\nparticipants (Pal, Ayumu and Puchi) paid close attention to the\ndemonstrator. They observed intently the ‘‘straw-sucking’ tech-\nnique within a distance of 50 cm, and subsequently switched their\ntechnique (Movie S2). One participant, Pan, failed to observe\nclosely the demonstrator and to show such a rapid switch in\ntechnique. Her subordinate status to the demonstrator (Pendesa)\nmight have limited her access to the juice devices as Pendesa often\noccupied both juice sites available in the experimental booth.\nHowever, we never observed any displacement or agonistic\ninteractions between the two throughout the experiment. When\nwe placed Pan and the demonstrator separately into two adjacent\nbooths divided by a transparent wall and each was equipped with\na juice bottle device (paired 2 condition), Pan then finally switched\nto using the ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique. Mari, who never closely\nattended conspecific demonstrations of the ‘‘straw-sucking’’\ntechnique and consequently never learned this alternate tech-\nnique, only finally switched her technique after watching\nconsecutive demonstrations performed by a familiar human. Once\nthe chimpanzees switched to using the ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique,\nthey never again reverted to using the less efficient ‘‘dipping’’\ntechnique.\nThe chimpanzees appeared to socially learn the tool-use\n‘‘technique’’ they observed their partner perform. Both the\n‘‘dipping’’ and ‘‘straw-sucking’’ techniques involved the same tool\n(straw-tube), the same target (juice), and exactly the same location\n(a hole of 1 cm in diameter drilled into the panel wall). When\ndipping, the chimpanzees sometimes used their mouth to\nmanipulate and insert the tube into the bottle to dip for juice\n(Figure 1; Movie S1). In these cases, the form was identical to that\nseen in the ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique. This suggests that the\nchimpanzees actually learned the ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique by\nimitation or emulation rather than via simple local or stimulus\nFigure 1. Both the ‘‘dipping’’ and ‘‘straw-sucking’’ techniques\nentailed the same tool (straw-tube), the same target (juice),\nand exactly the same location (small hole).Actually in the scene\ndepicted in this photo, the chimpanzee thereafter retrieved the tube\nand licked its tip (‘‘dipping’’).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0055768.g001\nChimpanzee Social Learning of a Tool-Use Technique\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e55768\nenhancement. Since the straw-tube was not opaque, we could not\ndistinguish true imitation (copying the form of the action) and\nemulation (replicating the visible environmental result) [32]. Even\nwithout true imitation, however, cultural differences can be\nmaintained and transmitted as long as social learning reliably\nleads to the same result that was demonstrated [33].\nThe chimpanzee participants of this study switched their\ntechnique to a more efficient one through social learning, although\nprevious studies [30–31] failed to uncover such improvements in\ntechnique. We propose two explanations for this difference in\nresults. First, in the present study, there was no pertinent difference\nin perceptuo-motor and cognitive complexity between the two\ntechniques, while there was in a previous study [30]. Both the\n‘‘dipping’’ and ‘‘straw-sucking’’ techniques emerged spontaneously\nduring the pre-test examination phase. In addition, the behavioral\nact of inserting the tube into the bottle was identical for the two\ntechniques and both ‘‘dipping’’ and ‘‘sucking’’ were components of\nthe chimpanzees’ customary behavioral repertoire. Second, the\nchimpanzees in previous studies [30–31] appeared satisfied with\ntheir own existing technique, while the participants in the present\nstudy may not have been. This latter hypothesis may best explain\nthe observed switch in technique reported here, suggesting\ntherefore that chimpanzees do not ‘‘copy-if-better’’ but rather\n‘‘copy-if-dissatisfied’’ which does not necessarily imply any\nsophisticated cognitive judgment of efficiency [34]. Puchi, Pan,\nand Mari stopped dipping during the first individual condition,\nwhich suggests that they were not satisfied with their own dipping\ntechnique. Pal and Ayumu, who continued dipping throughout the\nfirst individual condition, observed the demonstrator’s sucking\nbefore she even finished drinking up the juice in the first trial of the\npaired condition. Therefore, Ayumu and Pal could not have\nreadily noticed or evaluated the difference in efficiency between\nthe two techniques. These results support the ‘‘copy-if-dissatisfied’’\nhypothesis. The present study also demonstrates that even older\nchimpanzees (e.g. 41-year-old Puchi in this study) can socially\nlearn a novel technique, if they are not satisfied with their own and\nare motivated enough to explore alternatives.\nChimpanzees can therefore rely on simpler cognitive mecha-\nnisms for cumulative culture than previously assumed. A study of\nwild chimpanzees indicated that a young chimpanzee invented\nand modified a novel tool-use behavior based on the existing\nbehavioral repertoire customary of his community [35]. Although\nevidence for cumulative culture, i.e. the ‘‘ratchet effect’’, in\nchimpanzees in the wild remains circumstantial and speculative\n[3–4,7–9], the present study suggests that individuals can acquire\nimproved tool-use techniques through social learning. However,\nwho invents this novel technique may dictate its future spread and\nwho learns thereafter from whom [23,25,36]. The present study\nalso reveals that the latency to adopt the more efficient method\nwas related to how attentive the observers were to the\ndemonstrations. Even if a subordinate individual innovated a\nnew technique, this novel behavior might not spread, as he or she\nwould likely fail to act as a salient demonstrator and catalyst for\nthe diffusion of this new behavior, albeit more efficient [29,37].\nMeanwhile, if a high-status individual or a mother acquired the\nnew behavior, the improved behavior and technique could spread\nto other group members either due to the prestige of the\ndemonstrator [37] or the inter-generational transmission from\nmother to offspring [38]. However, our study failed to reveal any\nclear effect of the non-kin demonstrator’s middle-ranked status on\nsocial transmission. As previously argued [39], strong mutual\ntolerance to close observation, added to individual motivation,\nmay therefore also act to promote diffusion of novel behavioral\nvariants.\nOur results also indicate that clear evidence of cumulative\ncultural evolution among our closest evolutionary neighbors may\nbe constrained by other factors than their cognitive capacity. It is\npossible that we are currently unable to appreciate the extent of\ncumulative cultural evolution in chimpanzees because of the\nrelatively short timescale of studies conducted in the wild. In\naddition, chimpanzees may infrequently experience ecological\nand/or social selective factors that would give rise to innovations\nreflecting improved increments in technology in combination with\nconditions favorable to the social transmission of the novel\nbehavior [10]. The present study, combined with previous studies\n[30–31], suggests that chimpanzees switch technique when not\nsatisfied with their own. Hence, necessity and opportunity appear\nto act as key prerequisites for cumulative cultural evolution.\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nParticipants were socially housed chimpanzees at the Primate\nResearch Institute, Kyoto University (KUPRI). The participants\nspend their daily life with other group members in enriched\nfacilities [40], and had ad libitum access to water and were not\nfood deprived. Participation in our experiment was dependant on\nthe participant’s motivation: the experimenter called the name of a\nparticipant (who was in the outdoor enclosure with other group\nmembers), and he/she could decide whether or not to take part in\nthe study. The present study was approved by the Animal Care\nCommittee of the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University\n(approval ID; 07-1544), and the chimpanzees were tested and\ncared for according to ‘‘the Guide for the Care and Use of\nLaboratory Primates, 2\nnd edition’’ produced by the ethics\nTable 1.Switch in tube-use techniques from ‘‘dipping’’ to ‘‘straw-sucking’’.\nIndividual Paired 1 Individual Paired 2\nP a l DDDDDD S S S S SSSSSS\nA y u m u DDDDDD D S S S SSSSSS\nP u c h i D - - - - D - - SSSSSSS\nP a n D D ---D - ---D ----- SSSS\nM a r i ------ - D -D --D --- DDDD\nNote: Individual: condition where each participant was tested individually; Paired: condition where each participant was tested with the conspecific ‘‘straw-sucking’’\ndemonstrator (1: together in a booth with two juice bottles; 2: separated in two adjacent booths each equipped with a juice bottle); D: ‘‘dipping’’ technique; S: ‘‘straw-\nsucking’’ technique; ‘‘DS’’: firstly ‘‘dipping’’ technique, and then ‘‘straw-sucking’’ technique after observing the demonstrator’s straw-sucking; -: no try; trials highlighted\nin grey indicate that a participant observed the demonstrator’s ‘‘straw-sucking’’ within a distance of 50 cm.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0055768.t001\nChimpanzee Social Learning of a Tool-Use Technique\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e55768\ncommittee of the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University\n(2002). Our procedure also followed the recommendations of the\nWeatherall report, ‘‘The use of non-human primates in research’’.\nAll participants, nine chimpanzees in total, had previously taken\npart in a variety of perceptual and cognitive studies, including\nexperiments which examined their honey-dipping behavior and\nsocial learning of tool-use [24,38]. The participants (Pal: 7-year-\nold female, Ayumu: 7 y male, Pan: 23 y female, Mari: 31 y\nfemale, and Puchi: 41 y female) who initially demonstrated the\n‘‘dipping’’ technique were the focal subjects of the present study.\nThe ‘‘straw-sucking’’ demonstrator was a middle-ranked 30-year-\nold female, Pendesa, who had no kin-relationship with any of the\n‘‘dipping’’ participants, ‘‘Dipping’’ was defined as inserting a\nflexible tube into a hole providing access to a juice reward\ncontained in a small bottle externally affixed to the booth’s panel\nwall, retrieving the tool, and licking the tip. ‘‘Straw-sucking’’ was\ndefined as inserting the tube into the same hole and drinking the\njuice reward using the tube as a straw.\nThe chimpanzee participants were tested in an experimental\nbooth (291 cm 6192 cm, 200 cm high). In the ‘‘individual’’ and\n‘‘paired 1’’ conditions, two juice bottle containers (2 m apart) and\ntwo portable translucent silicon tubes (18 cm long, 8 mm in\nexternal diameter and 3 mm in internal diameter) were available\nto the subjects. In the ‘‘paired 2’’ condition, when the subjects\nwere tested separately in two adjacent experimental booths divided\nby a transparent wall (136 cm 6142 cm and 155 cm 6142 cm,\n200 cm high), each booth was equipped with a tube and a juice\ncontainer affixed to the panel wall. We first examined individually\neach participants’ spontaneous tube-use behavior. We then\nselected all five ‘‘dipping’’ participants and one ‘‘straw-sucking’’\ndemonstrator. The participants were thereafter tested in at most 4\nblocks of 5 trials in the individual and the paired conditions\nalternately (Table 1). We conducted one 10 min trial per day for\neach focal participant. We recorded the participants’ behavior and\ninteraction with three video cameras (Panasonic NV-GS150).\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary data, with video clips of the two tool-use\ntechniques and observational learning, are available as supporting\nmaterials.\nSupporting Information\nMovie S1 The ‘‘dipping’’ technique performed by a chimpanzee\nAyumu. Note that he uses his mouth to insert the tube into the\nbottle. In form, his technique is identical to the ‘‘straw-sucking’’\ntechnique. However, instead of leaving the tube in and retrieving\nthe juice via sucking, he removes the tube and licks the tip.\n(MPG)\nMovie S2 Close observation and subsequent switch in technique\nused. Pal (out of sight in the first view) closely observes the\ndemonstrator, then fetches a tube from the floor (out of sight), and\nthen proceeds to suck the remainder of the juice in the bottle\ncontainer. Pal had just performed the ‘‘dipping’’ technique prior to\nobserving the alternate technique being demonstrated during the\nsame trial.\n(MPG)\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank T. Matsuzawa, M. Tomonaga, C.
