INTRODUCTION \nWITCHING frequency is an important factor in determining \nthe size of the passive components, in a power electronic s \nconverter. Objectives such as miniaturization, cost reduction, \nand ease of manufacturing have resulted in  the converters with \nhigher switching frequencies [1]. In spite of some advantages \nsuch as better transient performance and imp roved integration \nof passive components at higher frequencies, achieving a \nreliable and an efficient high frequency converter , is still \nchallenging [1,2]. Although, a higher switching frequency can \nreduce the overall volume of magnetic elements, it will ad d to \nthe core/copper losses and will generate further electromagnetic \ninterference (EMI) especially at high frequency (HF) (3 MHz < \nFsw < 30 MHz) and very high frequency (VHF) (30 MHz < Fsw \n< 300  MHz) applications [2]. Leakage inductance and AC \nresistance of the windings can significantly impact the \nperformance and efficiency of the transformer. \n    In order to reduce switching losses in the HF converters, zero \nvoltage switching (ZVS) and zero current switching (ZCS) are  \ncommonly used. In such scenarios, if the leakage inductance \nand parasitic capacitance of the inductors are not considered \nand accurately estimated, additional modes of oscillation can \n                                                           \n \nappear in the circuit, and can lead to lower efficiencies as well \nas creating problems in control systems , especially in new \ncontrol techniques for power electronics converters [3 -5].  \nHowever, if these parameters are known, they can be \nincorporated in the ZVS/ZCS resonant tanks to reduce the \noverall size of the converter [6]. Leakage inductance is directly \nrelated to the winding topology and transformer structure. \nTherefore, to see the effectiveness and impact of the \ntransformer structure on the values of leakage inductance, \nanalyzing transformers with different winding arrangements , \nconsidering the skin effect, can be beneficial.   \n    To obtain an accurate estimate of the leakage inductance and \nAC resistance in HF/VHF applications, it is necessary to \nconsider the skin effect. Because of the magnetic field \ngenerated by the passing current, the current is pushed towards \nthe surface of the conductor. This phenomenon is called skin \neffect and leads to a lower utilization of the inner surface of the \nconductor; and consequently , a smaller effective current \ncarrying cross section area. As the frequency goes higher , the \nskin effect intensifies. Therefore, the cross -sectional area \ndecreases. As the inductance value is also related to  the cross \nsectional area, the leakage inductance decreases. Moreover, the \nresistance is inversely proportional to the effective area of the \ncross section. Thus, by increasing the frequency , it is expected \nto see higher resistance in the windings. Hence, inclusion of the \nskin effect in the analysis of HF inductors is crucial.  \n    In this paper, a transformer with different winding \narrangements and different conductor types, were designed and \nconsidered at 20  MHz. By considering the skin effect, the \nmagnetic fields are depicted by using FEM simulations. Then, \nleakage inductance and winding AC resistance are obtained and \ncompared with each other. The results show a range of leakage \ninductance and AC resistance , which can be used in VHF \napplications. Also, comparing different structure s can help to \nunderstand, which topology and structure is better for which \napplication.  \nII. TRANSFORMER MODEL AND STRUCTURE   \n    In this section, the transformer topology, which used in this \nstudy is displayed. The trans former dimensions are selected , \nbased on the procedure discussed in [1, 7]. As the frequency \nincreases, the passive component size decreases , but core loss \nmay limit further decrease in the transformer size. Equation (1) \nshows the relation between cross sectional area and frequency.  \nMohamad Saleh Sanjarinia, Sepehr Saadatmand, Pourya Shamsi, and Mehdi Ferdowsi  \nDepartment of Electrical and Computer Engineering \nMissouri University of Science and Technology \nRolla, Missouri, USA \nCorresponding Author: Mohamad Saleh Sanjarinia (mswvq@mst.edu) \nAnalysis of Skin Effect in High Frequency \nIsolation Transformers \nS \n \n𝐴 =\n𝐸\n𝐾𝑁𝑓𝐵                 (1) \n    In equation (1), 𝐴 is the cross sectional are of the core, 𝐸 is \nthe RMS voltage produced by the flux change over time based \non the Faradays law, 𝐾 is the waveform constant, 𝑁 is number \nof turns, 𝑓 is the frequency, and 𝐵 is amplitude of flux peak.   \n     By using Steinmetz equation loss density of the core can be \nfound. \n \n𝑃 = 𝐾. 𝑓𝛼.

As \nthe very high frequency is the goal, involving skin depth as a \nparameter which show the depth of penetrating current into the \nconductor, is very influential. \n \n𝑃 =\n1\n2 𝐼𝑎𝑐\n2 𝑅𝑎𝑐 =\n1\n2 𝐼𝑎𝑐\n2 𝜌𝜄𝜔\n𝜔𝜔𝛿 =\n1\n2 𝐼𝑎𝑐\n2 𝜌\n𝜔𝜔\n√𝜋𝜌𝜇0𝑓              (3) \n \n    In equation (3), 𝐼𝑎𝑐\n  is the sinusoidal ac current am plitude, 𝜌 \nis the conductor resistivity, 𝜄𝜔 is the length of the winding, \n𝜔𝜔 is the effective width of the conductor, and δ is the skin \ndepth. It is clear that, the skin depth is inversely proportional to \nthe frequency value.  \n    The VHF transformer studied here, is an EE core with ferrite-\nNiZn 67-Material core type, which B-H curve of the core used \nfor simulations are depicted in Fig. 1. The ferrite is a suitable \ncore for high frequency applications. Low core losses, low \nrelatively cost, and good tem perature stability are some of the \nfeatures of the ferrite cores. 67-Material is a low loss magnetic \ncomponent that is suitable for very high frequency applications \n(up to 50 MHZ). But most of its applications are between 2 -20 \nMHz. Over 20  MHz lack of mate rial performance data is a \nchallenging issue for designing magnetic material components. \nFor the core loss, equation (2) for the 67 -material at 20  MHz \ncan be displayed by the equation (4) (at duty cycle of 0.5).

To calculate the leakage inductance , by short \ncircuiting the secondary and injecting nominal current to the \nprimary the magnetic field strength (H) are depicted. For the EE \ncores, the leakage inductance can be found by calc ulating \nmagnetic energy between two window areas, while the \nsecondary is short circuited.

Field Distribution and Skin Effect \n    Fig. 5 shows the current density distribution in the circular \nand the square wires during the full load working of the \ntransformer. As it is clear , in center parts of the wires , the \ncurrent density is very low, but at the parts near the surface the \ncurrent density is much higher. \n \n \n                                             \n(a)                                      (b) \nFig. 5.

In Fig. 6 it is clear that , the current penetrated much \ndeeper inside wires than Fig. 5 which shows J at 20  MHz. On \nthe other word, the skin depth difference, which is clear \nequation (3) at higher frequencies  is much lower than lower \nfrequency. It is expected that the skin effect decreases the \nleakage inductance and increase s the AC resistance of the \nwindings, because of lowering the cross sectional area in the \nconductors. Moreover, to show how the current density values \nchange in the conductors, at very high frequency, and see   the   \nnumeric variations of the skin effect at 20 MHz, by defining the \ncutline that are shown in Fig. 7 the current density across the \nconductors are displayed at the graphs of Fig. 8. It is clear in \nFig. 8 (a) and (c) that current density at the center part o f the \nconductors reaches near to zero but at the skin parts there are \nvery much current density values. Fig. 8 (b) and (d) show the \nskin effect in a cross section of one conductor, explicitly. In \nthese two figures, at both circular and square shape conductors, \nthe current density decreases with a steep slope to almost zero \nand again increase with a fast slope to around 70 A/mm2 and 30 \nA/mm2 for circular and square shape conductors, respectively. \nIt seems that current density in the AWG18 circular shape is \nmuch higher than the current density at the square shape \nconductor that is equivalent to the same AWG.  \n    Also, the numeric variations of the current density for both \ntypes of the transformers at 20 kHz are displayed in Fig. 9 with \nthe same condition for the transformer as 2 0 MHz, to compare \nthe influence of the skin effect on both types.   \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \n     \n                      (c) \n(d) \nFig. 9. Current density norm (A/mm2) across the defined cutline in Fig. 7 from \nbottom to above at 20 kHz. a) Current density on the cutline of Fig.7 (a) across \nthe primary conductors at the right window. b) Current density on the cutline \nof Fig.7 (b) across the primary conductors at the right window. c) Current \ndensity on the cutline of Fig.7 (c) across the primary conductors at the right \nwindow. d) Current density on the cutline of Fig.7 (d) across the primary \nconductors at the right window. \n \nIt is obvious from the Fig. 9 that current density distribution is \nmore even , in comparison  to the 20 MHz a nd there is \nremarkable current density at the center parts of the conductors, \nwhich is expected to lead more leakage inductance and less \nwindings AC resistance.     \n    The maximum of current density in the conductors at 20 kHz \nis much lower than maximum of the current density at 20 MHz \nand the distr ibution is very even. Also, it is clear that in the \nsquare shape conductors, the skin effect is slightly weaker than \nthe AWG18 circular shape conductors. This feature can help in \nthe transformers with high number of turn windings to reduce \nthe skin effect , even marginally ; because it may lead to less \nwinding losses. Furthermore, in some applications , which may \nuse litz wire to reduce skin effect, choosing the shape of the \nstrands can lead to lowering litz wire loss. \n\n \nB. Leakage Inductance Calculations \n    To find the leakage inductance for al l types of the \ntransformers, by considering (5) it is clear that magnetic field \ndistribution strength (H) is a significant factor. H distribution as \nthe key factor of calculating leakage inductance by short \ncircuiting the secondary for all four types of the transformer are \ndepicted in Fig. 10. Also, m agnetizing inductance, leakage \ninductance, and AC resistance of the windings seen on the  \nprimary side, are displayed in TABLE III by considering the \nskin effect at 20  MHz; it is noted that, a s the magnetic field \nstrength get intensified in the space -especially in the window \narea-the leakage inductance goes higher.  \n    To compare the influence of the skin effect on the results, the \nleakage inductance and AC resistance at 20 KHz are shown in \nTABLE IV. As was expected, the leakage inductance changes \ndirectly and  the AC resistance  changes indirectly with the \nfrequency due to the skin effect and eddy current. I n all of the \ntransformer types this pattern is observable , except t ype c.  \nBecause the structure and the winding arrangement of type c , \ncancel the skin effect and prevent the eddy current to flow.    \n    TABLE III shows a range of different values for the leakage \ninductance and  the AC resistance in each of the transformer \ntypes. Lowering the parasitic parameters and loss parameters  \nhelp to a better performance for the  power electronics devices, \nin very high frequency. Also, changing the parameters can lead \nto remove unwanted resonant frequencies. As it is clear in this \ntable, by using the foil conductors, AC resistance reduces, up to \n400 times for the type c (overlaid foil windings ) and 12 times  \nfor the type d (non-overlaid foil windings), compared  to the \nAWG conductors. The leakage inductance in the AWG circular \nshape conductors is 2 times greater than the square shapes. By \nusing the foil conductors of the type c, in spite of lowering \nwinding loss , the leakage inductance is 2 times and 4 times \ngreater than the AWG circular shape and the square shape \nconductors, respectively. Also, using foil conductors of type d \ndecreases winding loss significantly too, but in this case the \nleakage inductance is 8 times, 14 times, and 4 times greater than \nthe AWG circular shape, square shape conductors and foil of \nthe type c, respectively. It is noted that the type d AC resistance \nis 30 times greater than  the  type c. Hence, deciding to choose \nwhich topol ogy and structure needs a compromise between \nparameters. \n    Fig. 11 illustrates the leakage inductance and the winding AC \nresistance of the transformers at  the different frequencies from \n20 kHz to 20  MHZ. Fig 11 (c) shows the absence of the eddy \ncurrent in the transfor mer windings at all frequencies. Fig 11 \n(d) shows that at the frequencies  higher than 200 kHz eddy \ncurrents cannot flow in the foil windings of this transformer , \nwhile at the lower frequencies , the windings show some \nportions of eddy currents. \n \n                      (a)                                                              (b) \n      \n                       (c)                                                              (d) \nFig. 10.

CONCLUSION \n    The s kin effect is responsible  for leakage inductance \ndecrement and winding AC resistance increment at higher \nfrequencies. In conductors such as circular and square shaped \nwires, which are studied in this paper, the skin effect leads to \nvariations in the leakage inductance and the winding losses. To \nmitigate this, foil con ductors are a suitable choice for the  \nconductor shape. By using foil conductors, the winding \narrangements in the transformers play an effective role as well. \nAs it is shown in the previous section, the winding \narrangements, the conductor shapes, and structures can change \nthe results of parasitic and loss behavior of the high frequency \ntransformers significantly, while giving the same value for the \nmagnetizing inductance. According to  the results of this study \nfor the  same value of the magnetizing inductance, the \ntransformer structure and the winding topology can change the \nleakage inductance and the winding AC resistance up to 13 \ntimes and 400 times, respectively. Moreover, in the wire \nconductors, shape of the wires despite of the same value for \ncross sectional area, can affect the parasitic an d loss behavior . \nThe reason is that, this shape can slightly change the skin effect \nbehavior in the conductors. In this study , by changing the \nsquare shape to the circular shape the leakage inductance and \nthe winding loss increase up to 2 times and 1.2 times, \nrespectively. Furthermore, the frequency responses for all of the \nwinding structures studied, show  that in wire conductors , the \nleakage inductance and the winding AC resistance change \nsignificantly between lower and higher frequencies. However, \nthis behavior is not noticeable in the foil conductors. Lastly, to \nchoose the best structure, winding arrangement, and conductor  \nat very high frequency domain, for having a better parasitic and \nloss behavior, it is essential to make a trade-off in designs.   \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENT \nThis material is based upon work supported by the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy, \"Enabling Extreme Fast Charging with \nEnergy Storage\", DE-EE0008449.  \nREFERENCES \n[1] Perreault, David J., et al. “Opportunities and Challenges in Very High \nFrequency Power Conversion.” 2009 Twenty -Fourth Annual IEEE Applied \nPower Electronics Conference and Exposition , 2009, \ndoi:10.1109/apec.2009.4802625. \n[2] Shamsi, Pourya, and Babak Fahimi. “Design and Development of Very \nHigh Frequency Resonant DC –DC Boost Converters.” IEEE Transactions on \nPower Electronics , vol. 27, no. 8, 2012, pp. 3725 –3733., \ndoi:10.1109/tpel.2012.2185518. \n[3] S.
