    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose To study the role of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify key risk factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening and develop recommendations based on clinician and large language model (LLM) based AI platform opinions for newly detected diabetes mellitus (DM) cases. Methods Five clinicians and three AI applications were given 20 AI-generated hypothetical case scenarios to assess DR screening timing. We calculated inter-rater agreements between clinicians, AI-platforms, and the “majority clinician response” (defined as the maximum number of identical responses provided by the clinicians) and “majority AI-platform” (defined as the maximum number of identical responses among the 3 distinct AI). Scoring was used to identify risk factors of different severity. Three, two, and one points were given to risk factors requiring screening immediately, within a year, and within five years, respectively. After calculating a cumulative screening score, categories were assigned. Results Clinicians, AI platforms, and the “majority clinician response” and “majority AI response” had fair inter-rater reliability (k value: 0.21–0.40). Uncontrolled DM and systemic co-morbidities required immediate screening, while family history of DM and a co-existing pregnancy required screening within a year. The absence of these risk factors required screening within 5 years of DM diagnosis. Screening scores in this study were between 0 and 10. Cases with screening scores of 0–2 needed screening within 5 years, 3–5 within 1 year, and 6–12 immediately. Conclusion Based on the findings of this study, AI could play a critical role in DR screening of newly diagnosed DM patients by developing a novel DR screening score. Future studies would be required to validate the DR screening score before it could be used as a reference in real-life clinical situations. Clinical trial registration Not applicable.",

International Journal of Retina and Vitreous            (2024) 10:11 \nIntroduction\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) is a worldwide epidemic that \ncauses a variety of complications in the human body [ 1]. \nDM-related vascular complications usually develop after \na few years, and many individuals, especially those from \nmiddle- and low-income countries, do not have annual \nDM diagnosis check, leaving a large group undiagnosed \n[2]. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the many serious \neye-related complications of DM [ 3, 4]. DM patients are \nscreened for DR to identify and treat sight-threatening \nDR (proliferative DR and/or diabetic macular edema) \nand to recommend follow-up for those without DR or \nnon-proliferative DR without diabetic macular edema \n[5, 6]. Several population-based studies have found a \ndisproportionate prevalence of DR around the world, \nwith countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and the \nWestern Pacific having the highest prevalence and coun -\ntries in the South and Central America having the lowest \n[7]. In comparison to Western countries, the prevalence \nof DR in India is low, with estimates ranging from 5 to \n16%. The most recent publication from the SMART India \nStudy group found a national prevalence of 12.5% for DR \nand 4.0% for sight-threatening DR [ 6, 8]. This is despite \nthe fact that India has the world’s second-highest num -\nber of people with DM [9]. The main reason cited for this \nuneven distribution of DR cases worldwide is the differ -\nent screening strategies followed by different countries \n[10]. Furthermore, the personnel conducting the DR \nscreening, the DR classification used, and the presence \nof other systemic co-morbidities all have an impact on \ndetermining the exact prevalence of DR [11, 12].\nOther than the retina specialists, the initial DR screen -\ning for newly detected cases of DM is usually carried out \nby other ophthalmologists, and non-ophthalmologists \nsuch as optometrists and diabetologists using dilated \nfundoscopy or teleophthalmology tools such as mydriatic \nand non-mydriatic fundus cameras [ 10]. There are differ-\nences in the initial timing for DR screening even among \nophthalmologists. These distinctions are primarily due to \nthe area (urban/rural) in which they practice, the type of \ninstitution to which they are affiliated, and the types of \npatients they screen [ 13]. Diabetes patients have a large \nurban-rural divide, which hinders disease understand -\ning and prevents routine screening as per established \nprotocols. A streamlined strategy for initial DR screen -\ning would assist medical screening staff and patients in \ndetermining when to be screened.\nAI has been debated for its potential benefits and \ndrawbacks in medicine, including ophthalmology. Sev -\neral studies have used fundus photos and deep machine \nlearning AI for DR screening [ 14–16]. However, there \nare concerns about data acquisition, bias in data, bias \nin identifying ground truth, difficulty comparing dif -\nferent algorithms, challenges in machine learning, its \napplication in different groups of people, and human bar-\nriers to AI adoption in health care [ 17]. A large language \nmodel (LLM) or natural language processing algorithm \nis a form of generative AI that uses massive data sets \nto understand, summarize, generate, and predict new \ntext-based content [ 18]. Many such open source LLM-\nbased generative AI algorithms are currently freely and \neasily available, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT3.5v and \nChatGPT4.0v Google’s BARD, Microsoft’s Bing AI, and \nothers [19]. Most researchers and clinicians believe that \nAIs based on LLM could help reduce physician burden if \nintegrated into the electronic health record [20].\nIn countries with a large population and a low oph -\nthalmologist-to-patient ratio, retina specialists screening \nall newly detected diabetic patients with dilated fun -\ndus examination would be demanding, not enhance the \nyield of DR cases, and reduce the ophthalmologist’s time \nfor other patients [ 21]. We believe that AI can simplify \nscreening recommendations for non-ophthalmologists \nlike medical internists and DM specialists, as well as \ngeneral ophthalmologists, to guide newly diagnosed DM \npatients to retina specialists for DR screening. We found \nno literature on LLM-based AI for DR screening in newly \ndiagnosed DM.\nThus, the primary goal of this study was to investigate \nthe role of AI in establishing a streamlined method for \ndetermining the appropriate timing of initial screening \nfor DR with the help of ophthalmologists and various AI \nplatforms.\nMethods\nThis was a prospectively conducted questionnaire-based \nstudy. The study commenced by requesting ChatGPT \n3.5v (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA, USA) to generate 20 \nhypothetical clinical case scenarios pertaining to DM \nand the necessity and timing for an initial dilated fundus \nexamination conducted by an expert retina specialist. \nThis was accomplished by utilizing various combinations \nand permutations of the specified keywords, including \nage, gender, duration, type and control of DM, obesity, \nkidney disease, blood pressure, cholesterol, tobacco use, \npregnancy status, and family history of DM (Supplement \n1).\nThe clinical case scenarios were subsequently dis -\ntributed to a group of five retina specialists/clinicians \nwho possessed at least over five years of clinical experi -\nence in the field of retina and DR screening. These ret -\nina specialists have professional experience in various \norganizational settings, including government hospitals, \nindependent private practices, tertiary eye care hospi -\ntals serving both free and paying patients, and tertiary \neye care corporate hospitals exclusively serving pay -\ning patients. The responses provided by the clinicians \nto the clinical case scenarios were collected using a \nPage 3 of 8\nGopalakrishnan et al. International Journal of Retina and Vitreous            (2024) 10:11 \n3-point multiple-choice format, where each clinician was \nrequired to select only one response that best addressed \nthe appropriate timing for DR screening in each clini -\ncal case scenario. The three response options were \nwhether the DR screening should be done immediately, \nwithin one year, or within five years. The ‘majority clini -\ncian response’ for each specific case scenario was deter -\nmined by identifying the maximum number of identical \nresponses provided by the clinicians.\nSubsequently, an exact same set of clinical case sce -\nnarios with options was presented to various important \nAI platforms, including ChatGPT 3.5v, ChatGPT 4.0v, \nand Bing AI. ChatGPT 3.5v, ChatGPT 4.0v, and Bing AI \nwere last trained in January 2022, April 2023, and some -\nwhere in 2021, respectively. The text was entered into \nvarious AI platforms, with a specific request to provide \nthe most appropriate single response for each clinical \ncase scenario. The responses were generated using the \nsame set of multiple-choice options that were presented \nto the clinician. The query was formulated in a manner \nthat implies the clinician is asking about the most suit -\nable time for a patient’s first dilated retinal examination, \nrather than the patient seeking advice from the AI on \nwhen to schedule a visit to a retina specialist for a dilated \nfundus examination. The AI did not receive any feedback \nafter each case scenario, and the case descriptions were \ninputted in a sequential manner without initiating a new \nchat session. Figure  1 depicts the prompt used to gen -\nerate an opinion as well as the AI response. The formal \nresponses for each case scenario were documented based \non the outcomes generated by various AI platforms. The \ndetermination of the ‘majority AI response’ for each spe -\ncific case scenario was made by identifying the highest \ncount of identical responses among the three distinct AI \nFig. 1 Prompt applied to request an opinion from the ChatGPT3.5v AI platform, accompanied with the AI’s response to a specific scenario from the study\n \nPage 4 of 8\nGopalakrishnan et al. International Journal of Retina and Vitreous            (2024) 10:11 \nplatforms. For each individual clinical case scenario, the \n‘majority clinician response’ was compared to the ‘major-\nity AI response’ for agreement.\nBased on the responses obtained from the clinicians \nand different AI platforms, a consensus was reached on \nthe ‘most common’ response for each individual case \nscenario for determining the optimal timing for ini -\ntial screening for diabetic patients with dilated fundus \nexamination by a retina specialist. The determination of \nthe ‘majority response’ involved identifying the response \nwith the highest frequency among the clinicians and AI \nplatforms. Specifically, a maximum of eight responses \nwere considered, consisting of five from the clinicians \nand three from the various AI platforms.\nThe next stage of this study involved the development \nof a scoring system for DR screening. This scoring system \naimed to assist healthcare professionals in considering \nthe diverse risk factors associated with the development \nof DR. The scoring system was based on the responses \nprovided by the clinician and the outputs generated by \ndifferent AI platforms in response to various clinical \ncase scenarios. Six risk factors were identified from the \nclinical case scenarios used in the questionnaire that \nappeared to be relevant in determining the right timing \nfor DR screening. These include: (1) the patients’ age; (2) \nthe type of diabetes; (3) diabetes control; (4) the pres -\nence of concurrent systemic conditions such as obesity, \nhigh BMI, renal disease, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, \nand tobacco use; (5) familial predisposition to diabetes; \nand (6) pregnancy status. The identification of risk fac -\ntors that require prompt screening were assigned a score \nof three points for each risk factor based on the urgency \nof requiring DR screening. Risk factors that require \nscreening within a year were assigned two points, while \nrisk factors that require screening within five years were \nassigned one point for each risk factor. In the absence \nof a risk factor, a score of 0 would be assigned to it. The \ncomputation of a cumulative DR screening score would \nbe conducted, followed by the provision of a categorical \nclassification for the timing of screening based on the DR \nscreening scores. The DR scores were classified into three \ngroups according to the range of scores obtained during a \nspecific timing for DR screening.\nConsidering the nature of the study, the study was \nexempted from institutional review board.\nStatistical analysis\nThe inter-rater reliability agreements between the differ -\nent clinicians, different AI platforms, and the ‘majority \nclinician response’ and ‘majority AI response’ were calcu-\nlated on DATAtab: Online Statistics Calculator (DATAtab \ne.U. Graz, Austria. URL https://datatab.net) using Fleiss \nKappa and Cohen’s Kappa analysis. The Kappa result \nis interpreted as follows: ĸ values ≤ 0 as indicating no \nagreement and 0.01–0.20 as none to slight, 0.21–0.40 as \nfair, 0.41– 0.60 as moderate, 0.61–0.80 as substantial, and \n0.81–1.00 as almost perfect agreement [22].\nResults\nIn the first phase of the study, the inter-rater reliability \ncalculated by the Fleiss kappa test showed that there was \na fair agreement between the 5 clinicians with κ = 0.25. \nThe Fleiss Kappa showed that there was a fair agree -\nment between ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0 and Bing AI \nwith κ = 0.29. There was complete agreement between \nthe ‘majority clinician response’ and the ‘majority AI \nresponse’ in 45% (n = 9) of the real-life clinical case sce -\nnarios. The Cohen’s Kappa showed that there was a fair \nagreement between ‘majority clinician response’ and \n‘majority AI response’ with κ = 0.32. The inter-rate reli -\nability agreements between the individual AI platforms \nand the ‘majority clinician response’ for ChatGPT 3.5v, \nChatGPT 4.0v, and Bing AI were 0.24, 0.37, and 0.25, \nrespectively.\nWe noted six risk factors that appeared to be relevant \nin determining the right timing for DR screening based \non clinicians’ and different AI platforms’ responses to \na set of 20 hypothetical AI-generated real-life clinical \ncase scenarios. Individuals with poorly controlled or \nuncontrolled diabetes, as well as those with systemic co-\nmorbidities, required prompt screening and were thus \nassigned a score of 3 points for each risk factor. Individu -\nals with a family history of diabetes and pregnant women \nwith diabetes were required to be screened within a year \nand were given two points for each risk factor. Addition -\nally, individuals without the aforementioned risk fac -\ntors required screening within the first five years of DM \ndiagnosis. The patient’s age and type of diabetes had little \ninfluence on the need for immediate or early screening \nstrategies for DR. As a result, patients over the age of 45 \nor with type 2 diabetes were assigned a score of one for \neach criterion, whereas patients under the age of 45 or \nwith type 1 diabetes were not assigned any points. The \nDR screening score ranged from 0 to 10 for each clini -\ncal case scenario in this study, and three categories were \nformed based on these DR screening scores: (a) scores \nbetween 0 and 2 for cases requiring screening within 5 \nyears, (b) scores between 3 and 5 for cases requiring \nscreening within 1 year, and (c) scores between 6 and 12 \nfor cases requiring immediate screening (Table 1).\nDiscussion\nWith the support of AI and clinicians, this one-of-a-kind \nstudy identifies risk factors of varying significance that \nmay be important and relevant in determining the timing \nof DR screening in a newly diagnosed case of DM.

International Journal of Retina and Vitreous            (2024) 10:11 \nspecialties decide when to refer patients for DR screening \nto a trained retina specialist.\nThe prevalence of DM and, consequently, DR, as well \nas the availability of medical personnel and retina imag -\ning tools for screening, differ by geographic area [ 7]. \nA number of risk factors influence the DR screening of \nnewly diagnosed diabetic cases, which are either inde -\npendent or interdependent on one another. The Ameri -\ncan Diabetes Association’s (ADA) recommendations for \nDR screening in newly diagnosed DM cases are the most \nwidely accepted guidelines worldwide. According to the \nADA, screening recommendations for DM patients were \nprimarily based on two risk factors: type of DM and preg-\nnancy status [ 5]. Community-based studies have identi -\nfied over 12 risk factors that can hasten the development \nor progression of DR over time [ 23]. Therefore, the ADA \nguidelines appear to be overly simplified and inadequate. \nAlso, it is not always possible for a retina specialist to \ninquire about and diagnose these risk factors using vari -\nous laboratory tests in real-time situations. As a result, \ndeveloping a strategy and scoring system based on a few \nkey risk factors that is acceptable and routinely followed \nin clinical practice is becoming increasingly important. \nIndividual national screening strategies have been devel -\noped to determine the timing of retina screening, the \npersonnel who will conduct the screening, and the man -\nner in which the screening must be performed based on \ndisease prevalence and other risk factors [ 10]. These rec-\nommendations are intended to serve as a guide for oph -\nthalmologists rather than for referring DM specialists. \nThere is no uniform strategy for DR screening, even \namong retina specialists. Even in the current study, we \nfound only a moderate level of agreement among retina \nspecialists. In order to address this, we used the ‘majority \nclinician response, ’ i.e., the best response was chosen as \nthe most preferred timing for screening, establishing the \nmost preferred practice pattern followed by clinicians.\nSeveral latest generation chatbots developed using \nLLM-based generative AI applications have demon -\nstrated promising results in generalizing to previously \nunseen tasks, including medical question-answering \nrequiring scientific expert knowledge [ 24–26]. In order \nto formulate an answer, LLM understands the medi -\ncal context, recall, and interpret relevant medical infor -\nmation and produces a response in a text-based format. \nAlthough reported performance in ophthalmology has \nbeen mixed, LLM appear to have potential for use in eye \nhealth care applications. LLM-based generative AI with \nChatGPT and ChatGPT 4.0v has been used in retina for \na variety of indications, including International Coding \nof Diseases (ICD) for various case encounters [ 27, 28]. \nAI’s current role in DR is limited to preventive care, i.e., \nscreening [14, 17]. According to the ADA, AI can be used \nas an alternative to traditional screening methods in DR \n[29]. AI’s current role in DR is to screen retinal images \nfor the presence or absence of DR or sight-threatening \nDR [30]. However, AI should not be used in patients who \nhave known DR, have received prior DR treatment, or \nhave symptoms of vision impairment. Different chatbot \napplications respond to the same situations in different \nTable 1 Evaluation of risk factors and calculation of diabetic retinopathy screening scores for individual clinical case scenarios\nCase No. Age Type of DM DM control Systemic co-morbidities Family History of DM Pregnancy Majority Response DR Screening\nScore\n1 46 2 Poor Yes No No Immediate 8\n2 30 1 Good No Yes No Within 5 years 2\n3 55 2 Poor Yes No No Immediate 8\n4 28 2 Good No Yes Yes Within 1 year 5\n5 50 2 Poor Yes Yes No Immediate 10\n6 35 2 Good No No No Within 5 years 1\n7 60 2 Poor Yes Yes No Immediate 10\n8 40 2 Good Yes Yes Yes Immediate 8\n9 48 2 Poor Yes No No Immediate 8\n10 25 1 Good No No No Within 5 years 0\n11 55 2 Poor Yes Yes No Immediate 10\n12 33 2 Good No No Yes Within 1 year 3\n13 52 2 Poor Yes No No Immediate 8\n14 38 1 Good No Yes No Within 5 years 2\n15 58 2 Poor Yes Yes No Immediate 10\n16 29 1 Poor No Yes Yes Immediate 7\n17 46 2 Poor Yes No No Immediate 8\n18 22 1 Good No No No Within 5 years 0\n19 56 2 Poor Yes Yes No Immediate 10\n20 31 2 Good No No Yes Within 1 year 3\nAbbreviations: DM– diabetes mellitus; DR– diabetic retinopathy\nPage 6 of 8\nGopalakrishnan et al.

Even in the current study, the different AI \nplatforms only agreed on a moderate level for the same \nclinical case scenario. To address this issue, the ‘majority \nAI response’ was selected as the most preferred time for \nDR screening based on AI. In order to improve both the \nprecision and speed of responses, the AI platform must \nreceive the most up-to-date information and have real-\ntime access to the internet. In this study, we observed \nthat ChatGPT 4.0v performed better and had closer \nagreements with clinician responses than the other two \nAI platforms.\nDR is a retinal complication of prolonged DM that \naffects the retinal microvasculature [ 32]. As a result, the \nlonger the duration of DM, the higher the risk of devel -\noping DR or sight-threatening DR is usually consid -\nered. Individual national screening guidelines for DR, as \nwell as global guidelines developed by the International \nCouncil of Ophthalmology, have identified uncontrolled \nDM and presence of hypertension and other systemic co-\nmorbidities as risk factors which could alter the course of \nDR [10]. This study identified six factors based on clini -\ncians’ and AI’s responses. According to the findings of \nthis study, patients with poorly controlled blood sugar \nlevels or those with co-existing systemic co-morbidities \nrequired immediate DR screening, whereas those with a \nfamily history of DM or diabetic patients who were preg -\nnant preferred to be screened within a year. The absence \nof any of these risk factors made these cases less urgent \nfor screening, and they were screened over a 5-year \nperiod. The ADA guidelines instruct patients with type \n2 diabetes to undergo screening immediately after diag -\nnosis because many patients with type 2 diabetes have \nthe disease for a long time before being diagnosed, and \nimmediate screening is therefore recommended. Patients \nwith type 1 diabetes, on the other hand, must be screened \nwithin 5 years of disease diagnosis [ 5]. Based on this, we \nassigned one point to each risk factor, such as patients \nover the age of 45 and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we \ndiscovered that the patient’s age and type of diabetes \nhad less of an impact on the timing of DR screening in \nthe absence of other risk factors such as poor DM con -\ntrol, co-existing systemic comorbidities, pregnancy, and \na family history of DM. As a result, this study identified \nrisk factors of varying significance that may influence the \nprogression of DR and, as a result, the timing of screen -\ning in newly diagnosed cases of DM.\nThe study has some limitations. The number of clini -\ncal case scenarios generated hypothetically could have \nbeen increased, or the clinical case scenarios could have \nbeen presented to a larger number of clinicians and AI \napplications. The study placed little emphasis on com -\nparing the responses of various AI applications. Another \nlimitation of this study was that when developing the \ncase scenarios, the race of the patient was not taken \ninto account, and the questions were only presented to \nIndian ophthalmologists. Instead, the clinical case sce -\nnarios could have been presented to international oph -\nthalmologists, increasing the study’s global acceptability. \nThe term ‘majority’ clinician and AI responses used in \nthis study may mislead readers and be misinterpreted as \nthe best response from the entire field of retina special -\nists and AI platforms. The recommendations made in this \nstudy are based on expert opinions and clinically unvali -\ndated LLMs that have not consistently performed well \nin ophthalmologic field expertise in many other studies. \nFurthermore, inter-rater agreement was at the best only \nmoderate between LLMs and ophthalmologists, as well \nas between ophthalmologists themselves. As a result, \nwithout proper clinical validations, the study recommen -\ndations may be true and beneficial to some patients but \nnot to all. Nonetheless, the study has the advantage of \ndeveloping a simplified screening strategy for non-oph -\nthalmologists to send newly detected diabetic cases for \nretina screening by combining real-world clinical expe -\nrience with up-to-date AI information. After validating \nthese screening recommendations, it is possible that they \nwill be integrated into the hospital’s electronic medical \nrecord system, alerting ophthalmologists and non-oph -\nthalmologists to refer patients with newly detected DM \nfor timely DR screening and thus helping to reduce the \nnumber of unnecessary referrals to retina specialists who \nare less likely to have any form of DR.\nIn conclusion, AI has the potential to be highly influ -\nential in the screening of DR in newly diagnosed patients \nwith DM by creating an innovative DR screening score. \nFurther studies are necessary for validating the DR \nscreening score prior to its application as a guide in prac -\ntical clinical scenarios.\nAbbreviations\nDM  diabetes mellitus\nDR  diabetic retinopathy\nAI  artificial intelligence\nLLM  large language model\nADA  American Diabetes Association\nSupplementary Information\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi.\norg/10.1186/s40942-024-00533-9.\nSupplementary Material 1: Supply Clinical case scenarios generated by \nChatGPT 3.5v\nAcknowledgements\nNone.\nAuthor contributions\nRV, JC– conceptualising the study, data acquisition, analysing the data, \nstatistics and results, interpreting the findings, writing & reviewing the \nmanuscript.
