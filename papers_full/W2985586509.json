  "abstract": "In electric power systems, health index algorithms are mostly used for evaluation of the transformer population. In this method, some assessment criteria are insensitive when it comes to judging the technical state of the edges of the age spectrum. This paper presents a new health index calculation method that aims to improve the overall effectiveness of the assessment. The proposed algorithm is based on regularly conducted oil diagnostics and easily available maintenance data to enable estimation and updating of the device’s health status in short intervals from an operational point of view. This method is compared to another health index algorithm built from the same parameters, but with different weights and an alternative result assessment philosophy. The two health index calculation methods are tested on a population of 96 power transformers and then compared to results obtained with an expert system, which is based on much more advanced diagnostic tests to determine the technical condition of the unit. The results of the experiment show that proper selection of weighting factors of the transformer’s technical condition parameters during health index calculation may help in simplifying its assessment while maintaining satisfactory accuracy in comparison to a highly advanced expert method.",
