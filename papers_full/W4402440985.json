  "abstract": "In recent years, an increasing number of studies have begun to use conversational data in spontaneous speech to estimate cognitive function in older people. The targets of spontaneous speech with older people used to be physicians and licensed psychologists, but it is now possible to have conversations with fully automatic AI agents. However, it has not yet been clarified what difference there is in conversational communication with older people when the examiner is a human or an AI agent. This study explored the psychological burden experienced by elderly participants during cognitive function assessments, comparing interactions with human and AI conversational partners. Thirty-four participants, averaging 78.71 years of age, were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The objective was to assess the psychological impact of different conversational formats on the participants. The results indicated that the mental strain, as measured by VAS and STAI scores, was significantly higher during the MMSE sessions compared to other conversational interactions (p &lt; 0.01). Notably, there was no significant difference in the mental burden between conversations with humans and AI agents, suggesting that AI-based systems could be as effective as human interaction in cognitive assessments.",
