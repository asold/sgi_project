As early as in toddlerhood, humans learn how tools\nallow for reaching goals that would otherwise be out of reach. This learning involves transferring\nsolutions between problems, which, in turn, requires both an ability to identify those aspects of\nthe problem that are relevant for the solution, and remember a solution long enough to be able\nto apply it again. While both these capacities allegedly begin to develop in infancy (Träuble and\nPauen, 2007), they have – to date – only been studied separately from each other. The present\nstudy focuses on the joint contribution of these capacities at early stages of development of\ntool-dependent problem solving: a skill that underpins impressive human technological culture\n(Osiurak and Reynaud, 2019).\nTo discover which features of a tool are relevant for reaching a desired goal, infants attend to\nboth the tool itself and its interactions with objects in the environment (Rakison and Woodward,\n2008). In the ﬁrst year of life, infants rapidly acquire knowledge about objects and interactions,\nboth through own actions and through observing others (Leslie, 1984; Luo et al., 2009). In this\nprocess, perceptual features of the tool are linked to the eﬀect that it exerts, that is, to the function it\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 573730\nfpsyg-11-573730 October 2, 2020 Time: 11:52 # 2\nBobrowicz et al. Flexibility in Problem Solving\nserves (Bates et al., 1980). This allows the infant to, by the end of\nthe ﬁrst year, shift from attending to overall perceptual similarity\nto attending to functional similarity when faced with unfamiliar\nobjects, as long as the common function is demonstrated\nbeforehand (Träuble and Pauen, 2007).\nThus, it seems that 11- and 12-month-olds not only acquire,\nbut also transfer knowledge about the functional parts of objects;\nfor instance, they can identify a toothbrush and a dish brush\nas sharing the same functional part after observing washing the\ndishes with the latter. However, at this age, if a shovel had a\nhandle similar to that of a dish brush but diﬀerent from that of\nthe toothbrush, the child would most likely group the dish brush\nand the shovel as similar to each other, and as diﬀerent from the\ntoothbrush. In other words, 12-month-olds still fail to prioritize\nthe object’s functional features over conﬂicting perceptual ones\n(Madole et al., 1993; Booth and Waxman, 2002). Resolving such\nconﬂicts may develop much later, as even 24-month-olds may\nstruggle with disregarding the perceptually salient yet misleading\nfeatures of a tool in favor of the functionally relevant ones (Baker\nand Keen, 2007; Bechtel et al., 2013; Pauen and Bechtel-Kuehne,\n2016 but Chen et al., 1997). Although 24-month-olds still\nprioritize perceptual saliency over the tool’s function, contrary to\nyounger infants, they rapidly improve their performance upon\nfeedback. The improvement in selectively attending to the object’s\nfunction in the second year of life coincides with the onset of\ntool use in everyday life, e.g., eating with a spoon (Conolly and\nDalgleish, 1989; McCarty et al., 2011; Bechtel et al., 2013).\nSolving problems with tools poses a twofold diﬃculty: one\nmust identify the functionally relevant features within the tool\non the one hand, and the functionally relevant features within\nthe problem on the other. For instance, to open a door, one\nneeds to ﬁnd not only the right key, but also the keyhole. Relying\non such functional matches between problem and tool supports\ntransferring solutions across problems and therefore boosts\nbehavioral ﬂexibility. The ability to detect common principles for\nsolution across problems, termed analogical transfer, improves\nbetween the second and fourth year of life. For instance, Crisaﬁ\nand Brown (1986) showed that 2-year-olds failed to transfer\nspontaneously across problems, several 3-year-olds transferred\na solution across physically similar problems, and many 4-year-\nolds transferred across physically dissimilar problems that did not\nrequire tool use. Likewise, Brown and Kane (1988) showed that\n3-year-olds spontaneously transferred tool knowledge to a target\nstory but needed a slightly longer exposure to the source story\ncompared to 4- and 5-year-olds. Other studies have corroborated\nthis developmental trajectory (Holyoak et al., 1984; Brown, 1989;\nBrown et al., 1989; Goswami, 1991; Chen, 1996). Importantly,\nnone of these studies required actual tool use.\nBetween the second and fourth year of life, children rapidly\ndevelop a skill that is a hallmark of everyday human life: ﬂexible\ntool-dependent problem solving. Its ﬂexibility in adults is boosted\nby well-developed long-term memory, which allows for transfer\nacross both immediate and delayed situations (Bobrowicz,\n2019), but the interaction between long-term memory and\nanalogical transfer of tool use has been overlooked in research,\nregarding both adults and children. This is somewhat surprising,\nconsidering the role that analogical transfer of tool use has\nplayed in the development of human technological culture\n(Osiurak and Reynaud, 2019). Such development cannot rely\nsolely on analogical transfer of tool use; it must be supported\nby long-term memory that allows transferring technical skills\nbetween dissimilar contexts. The present study focuses on the\ninteraction between analogical transfer, tool use and long-term\nmemory in development.\nLong-term memory, including episodic and procedural\nmemory, supports analogical transfer across situations that,\nin everyday life, are often separated by hours, days or even\nmonths. It is unclear when long-term memory begins to support\nanalogical transfer in young children, but previous ﬁndings\nsuggest that immaturity of long-term memory, especially episodic\nmemory, may limit transfer between contexts before the age of\n3. While procedural memory allows for issuing motor actions\nacquired in the past, episodic memory warrants ﬂexible retrieval\nof relevant previous situations. While not much is known about\nthe development of procedural memory between the second and\nfourth year of life, brain structures associated with procedural\nmemory mature ahead of the structures associated with episodic\nmemory. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that procedural\nmemory matures earlier than episodic memory (Bauer, 2008) but\nﬁndings are scarce and contradictory (Lum et al., 2010). In any\ncase, it seems that episodic memory is available to 3-year-olds,\nbut improves further between the ages of 3 to 5, particularly in\nterms of richness of information about past situations (Hayne\net al., 2011), retention interval (from 15 min in 3-year-olds to 24 h\nor even a week in 4-year-olds; Scarf et al., 2013), and recollection\nof the temporal aspects of past situations (Scarf et al., 2017). What\ndoes not improve, however, is the accuracy of recollection (Hayne\net al., 2011), the ability to form episodic memories (Scarf et al.,\n2013), and the recollection of “what” and “where” happened in\nthe past situation (Scarf et al., 2017).\nFindings from episodic memory research suggest that children\nyounger than 4 years could struggle with applying knowledge\nto a target problem 24 h after training on a relevant source\nproblem. However, previous studies with deferred imitation\n(Herbert and Hayne, 2000) and object search (DeLoache et al.,\n2004) tasks demonstrated that even 2.5-year-olds can use long-\nterm memory to transfer knowledge across problems, both\nimmediately after training on the source task and 24 h later.\nThis suggests that even before the age of 3, children can identify\nand ﬂexibly apply relevant knowledge acquired on another,\nfunctionally similar task.\nIn the current study, we investigated the development of\nﬂexible tool-dependent problem solving in children 2- to 4-years\nold, focusing on tool use and analogical transfer across immediate\nand delayed situations. We limited language demands of the task\nto a minimum so that language abilities would not inﬂuence\nthe children’s performance. We designed a novel experimental\nsetup that required solving a problem through physical tool use,\nafter training on an analogical problem. A control group did not\nreceive this training. Children carried out the test task either\nshortly after training, or after a 24-h delay. This manipulation\nallowed for investigating the impact of short-term and long-term\nmemory on analogical transfer. Children who failed to solve the\ntest task with the perceptually incongruent tool set were further\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 573730\nfpsyg-11-573730 October 2, 2020 Time: 11:52 # 3\nBobrowicz et al. Flexibility in Problem Solving\ntested with another tool set, where the perceptual mismatch\nhad been removed. This manipulation, to a limited extent,\nallowed for investigating the impact of perceptual mismatch on\nanalogical transfer.\nWe predicted that:\n(H1) With age, children would be more likely to solve\nthe test task after training, regardless of the perceptual\nmismatch within the tool set.\n(H2) Compared to older children, younger children would\nbe less likely to solve the test task after 24-h delay.\nIn order to investigate ability to focus on the aspects relevant\nfor solving the problem, the setup involved a twofold diﬃculty –\nprioritizing the functionally relevant features of the problem over\nthe irrelevant ones, and prioritizing the functionally relevant\nfeatures of the tools over the irrelevant ones. Therefore, children\nneeded to not only transfer a solution between two perceptually\ndissimilar problems, but also overcome a mismatch (conﬂict)\nbetween the perceptual and the functional features of the tools.\nWe predicted that:\n(H3) With age, children who received training would\ninteract longer with the functional tool and the relevant\ncomponents of the apparatuses; showing that they\nsuccessfully identiﬁed the relevant aspects of the target\nproblem. Thus, with age, children who received training\nwill also interact shorter with the functional tool and the\nirrelevant components of the apparatuses.\n(H4) Compared to older children, younger children\nreceiving the test task with a 24-h delay would interact\nshorter with the functional tool and the relevant\ncomponents, but longer with the irrelevant components,\nshowing diﬃculties with identifying the relevant aspects of\nthe target problem.\n(H5) Children who solved the test task would interact\nlonger with the functional tool and the relevant\ncomponents of the apparatuses, compared to children\nwho did not. While interacting with the functional tool\nand the relevant components is critical to solving the\ntarget problem, such interactions do not guarantee the\nsolution if children do not know how to correctly apply the\ntool’s function.\n(H6) Removing the perceptual mismatch may not beneﬁt\nchildren who failed to solve the test with the perceptually\nmismatching tool set, since children between 2 and 4.5 years\nshould be able to prioritize tool function over irrelevant\nperceptual similarities.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nParticipants\nIn total, 122 children were recruited from eleven public\npreschools in urban and semi-urban areas of southern Sweden.\nFocusing on the ages of 2 to 4 years, we aimed at children 21–\n51 months old, but seven children who were 52–55 months old\nwere also included. The children’s average age was 40.42 months\n(SD = 7.49). Parental education was high, with 86.6% having\na college or university degree. Most children (57.7%) had one\nsibling, 13.8% had no siblings, and 21.1% had two siblings or\nmore. Only data from 105 children (51 boys/54 girls) were\nincluded in the present analysis. Data from 17 children were\nexcluded because of missing or distorted video recordings\n(n = 12), successful solution of all test tasks upon the ﬁrst\npresentation (n = 2, 43, and 48 months), or missing the second\nday of testing ( n = 3). Out of all children, 90 received training\nwhile 15 did not, serving as a control group. The control\ngroup was limited to 15 children as a trade-oﬀ, to increase the\npower of the statistical analyses conducted for the experimental\ngroup. The children’s mean age in the control group was\n38.53 months (SD = 9.09).\nThis research was approved by Swedish Ethical Review\nAuthority in Lund (DRN 2018/572, PI Psouni). No sensitive data\nabout participants was gathered, and only those children, whose\nparents submitted a written consent, either on paper or digitally,\nwere included in the study.\nMaterials\nSeven sets of tool-use tasks were developed, each with two puzzle\nboxes and three tools (see Figure 1 ). Each set consisted of a\ntraining task and a test task, which looked diﬀerent but required a\nsimilar solution. The puzzle boxes were made of medium-density\nﬁbreboard (MDF) and each had a transparent plexiglass surface\nthrough which the child could peek at a toy bee trapped inside.\nThe MDF was covered with non-toxic paint to make the boxes\nseem “dirty” and so discourage the children from touching them\nwith bare hands and try to retrieve the bee using tools instead.\nThe experimenter always wore gloves or used a paper towel to\nhandle the boxes to make this story more believable, and children\nwere playing along.\nEach set of tasks was accompanied by a set of three tools: a\nfunctional, a non-functional and a useless one, all made of white\nFIMO clay. The functional and the non-functional tools had the\nsame length and rigidity, but diﬀerent ends. The functional tool\nhad a functional element on both ends, and, paired with a correct\nmotor action on the child’s part, allowed for retrieving the bee.\nThe non-functional tool likewise had a non-functional element\non both ends, so regardless of the motor action executed by the\nchild, it did not allow for retrieving the bee. Finally, the useless\ntool diﬀered in length, shape and rigidity from the other two and\ndid not allow for solving the task ( Figure 1 ). Within each set,\nsolving both the training and the test task required the same tool\nand the same motor action (see Supplementary Figure S1). Each\nchild was tested with one set.\nAlthough the same set of tools was used in both the training\nand the test task, we manipulated the appearance of the tools.\nIn the baseline and the training, each of the tools had a unique\nsalient pattern painted on the white clay with a non-toxic dark-\nblue pen. The patterns on the functional and the non-functional\ntools were swapped in the test, leading to a perceptual mismatch\nbetween the baseline/training and the test.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 573730\nfpsyg-11-573730 October 2, 2020 Time: 11:52 # 4\nBobrowicz et al.

Within each set of apparatuses, the\ntraining task is depicted to the left and the test task to the right. Within each set of tools, the functional tool is depicted to the left, the non-functional in the middle,\nand the useless to the right. Simple motor actions were required to open each box: (A) inserting the tip of the functional tool into the gap in the upper part of the\napparatus (training) or the middle (test), and then lifting the tool’s handle;(B) hooking the tip of the functional tool onto the upper part of the door (training) or the hole\nin the front part of the lid (test), and then pulling the tool’s handle;(C) inserting the tip of the functional tool into the tube’s opening, and pushing the tool’s handle to\nthe side (training) or downward (test); (D) casting the loop-like tip of the functional tool onto the car’s hook (training) or the hook on the doors (test), and pulling the\ntool’s handle;(E) casting the rake-like tip of the functional tool onto the car (training) or the handle on the doors (test), and pulling the tool’s handle;(F) inserting the\ntips of the pincette-like functional tool, grasping the bee, and pulling the tool (training) or using the tips to grasp the string protruding from the tube, and pulling the\ntool (test); (G) inserting the tip of the hockey-bat-like functional tool, and raking the bee out (both training and test).\nIn an extra testing round that commenced after a failed test,\nthe perceptually mismatching set of tools was substituted with\nanother set, comprising a functional, non-functional and useless\ntool, all decorated with a uniform x-pattern (see Figure 2).\nProcedure\nChildren were recruited through announcements at\nthe preschools, after active, informed consent by their\nparents/guardians. Information about the study was both\nphysically and digitally available to parents. Test leaders spent a\nday in each preschool to become acquainted with the children.\nChildren were tested individually, at their preschools, at a\nroom arranged for the purposes of the experiment. All trials\nwere video-recorded, capturing the experimental setup and the\nparticipant’s hands. Before each trial, children were engaged in a\nshort chat about the box being dirty and the bee trapped inside\nthe box. If the children had not been interested in the task at\nthis point, the experimenter would not have proceeded with the\nbaseline. However, such problems did not occur, as all children\nwere interested in the trapped bee and releasing it, interacting\nwith tools and the apparatus.\nThe experiment employed a 2 × 2 factorial design,\nmanipulating condition (training vs. no training) and delay\n(short/10 min vs. long/24 hrs). At baseline, the child received a\nsingle opportunity to interact with the test task, from picking up\na tool, through using it on the apparatus, to abandoning the tool,\nto ensure that he/she could not solve the task spontaneously. All\nthree tools were available: a dot-patterned functional, a stripe-\npatterned non-functional and a wave-patterned useless one. If\nthe child chose the functional tool, used it in a correct way and\nreleased the bee, a test task from another set was presented.\nUpon failure to solve the task at baseline, children were\nassigned into either training (experimental) or no training\n(control). Children in the experimental group began the training\nimmediately after baseline.

Flexibility in Problem Solving\nFIGURE 2 |An overview of the procedure in the two experimental conditions: without training (A) or with training (B). Each child was ﬁrst presented with a puzzle\nbox containing a toy bee visible behind a transparent surface and three tools. If the child could not open the box, s/he either waited 10 min or 24 h before another\nchance to open the box (A) or s/he received a training on another box that required the same solution (B). After the training, she had another chance to open the\noriginal box, either right afterward or 24 h later. This ﬁgure shows the “B” set that required either hooking the tip of the functional tool onto the upper part of the door\n(training) or the hole in the front part of the lid (test) to solve the task.\none. Now, the child learned, with the help of the experimenter,\nhow to use the functional tool to retrieve the bee from the training\ntask. The child was ﬁrst encouraged verbally to try to release the\n“trapped” bee from the box. If the child did not succeed, the\nexperimenter would demonstrate once how to use the functional\ntool on the relevant components of the task. The child did not\nreceive any verbal instructions and, therefore, relied solely on\nthe motor demonstration. After each demonstration, the child\nwas verbally invited to try on his/her own. This sequence of\ndemonstrations by the experimenter and attempts by the child\nwere repeated until the child succeeded to retrieve the bee thrice\nwithout any help from the experimenter. Children assigned to the\ncontrol group did not receive training. Instead, they were allowed\nto play with the experimenter for an equivalent time period\nof 10 min (the training was estimated to last around 10 min).\nTherefore, children in the control group did not acquire, through\ntraining, relevant knowledge to apply to the test task and de facto\ndid not participate in a transfer procedure. Children were also\nassigned into either a 10-min short delay or a 24-h long delay\nbefore being presented with the test task.\nThe test task included three tools: a stripe-patterned functional\ntool (dot-patterned in the baseline), a dot-patterned non-\nfunctional tool (stripe-patterned in the baseline), and a wave-\npatterned useless tool (same as in the baseline). Therefore,\nalthough the functional features of the tools remained the same,\nthere was now a salient perceptual mismatch between the current\nand the previously used tools. Children received up to three\nopportunities to interact with the test task, from picking up\na tool, through using it on the apparatus, to abandoning the\ntool. Independently of whether they solved the tests or not,\nchildren received stickers and age-appropriate toys as tokens of\nappreciation for their participation.\nImmediately after three unsuccessful attempts at solving\nthe test task, the perceptually mismatching set of tools was\nsubstituted with another set, comprising a functional, non-\nfunctional and useless tool, all decorated with a uniform x-pattern\n(see Figure 1). In this extra testing round, the child was allowed\nthree new attempts at solving the test task with the set of tools.\nCoding and Statistical Analysis\nFor each video, the child’s score and interactions with the\napparatus were coded frame-by-frame in ELAN 4.9.4. An\ninteraction was deﬁned as the time interval between onset and\noﬀset of physical contact of a tool held by the participant and\na component of the apparatus. The tool could be functional\n(F), non-functional (NF) or useless (U), and the component\nof the apparatus could be relevant (rel) or irrelevant (irrel; see\nSupplementary Datasets 1 and 2 ).

For each recording, several variables\nwere computed from the coded interactions (see Supplementary\nDataset 1 and 2).\nBecause of its small size, the control group was not included\nin the main statistical analyses. However, Fisher’s exact test was\nrun to statistically compare performance between the control and\nthe experimental group.

For hypotheses testing, best model\nselection for generalized linear models was carried out with\nthe following functions: glm (glmulti package; Calcagno, 2013),\ndredge, get.models (MuMIn package; Barton, 2020), and Anova\n(car package; Fox and Weisberg, 2011). Contrasts were calculated\nwith glht function from multcomp package (Hothorn et al., 2008)\nand power was estimated with Nagelkerke’s R2, using PseudoR2\nfunction from DescTools package Signorell et al., 2019). Weights\nequal to the total interaction time per child were speciﬁed in each\nmodel, so that children who did not interact with the box would\nbe excluded from the interactions’ analyses. The results were\nplotted with the interactions package (Long, 2019). Signiﬁcance\nlevel was set at 0.05.\nRESULTS\nAll children between 24 and 29 months ( n = 10) failed to\nsolve the test, and therefore this group was excluded from\ngeneralized linear models. Instead, Fisher’s exact test was run\nto statistically compare performance between children between\n24 and 29 months and children older than 29 months. Among\nchildren who received training ( n = 90), 46% ( n = 41) solved\nthe test, 43% ( n = 18) of whom after the short delay (for\ndetails see Table 1). None of the children who did not receive\ntraining (n = 15) solved the test, and the probability of doing so\nwas signiﬁcantly lower than for children who received training\n(p = 0.004). Therefore, training was prerequisite for solving the\ntest. In the short delay group, the delay between baseline and test\nwas much shorter than 10 min as children in the experimental\ngroup needed shorter trainings than planned, 2 min on average\n(M = 2.02, SD = 0.87), and children in the control group played\nshorter with the experimenter than planned, 5.5 min on average\n(M = 5.36, SD = 0.88). Five children who received training (29,\n31, 37, 43, and 47 months; compared to two who did not receive\ntraining, 32 and 49 months) did not interact with the test task and\nwere excluded from the interactions’ analyses.\nAmong 54 children who failed to solve the test with a\nperceptually incongruent set of tools and proceeded to the extra\ntest (N = 54, 26 boys/28 girls), the children’s ages ranged between\n1http://www.R-project.org\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 573730\nfpsyg-11-573730 October 2, 2020 Time: 11:52 # 7\nBobrowicz et al.

Due to the small size of this group, further\nstatistical analyses based on generalized linear modeling were not\npossible. Only categorical data analysis with Hildebrand’s Del was\npossible (Hildebrand et al., 1977; Drazin and Kazanjian, 2017)\nand showed that, after the perceptual mismatch was removed,\nchances of solving the test were low, but not non-existent.\nH1: Children Are More Likely to Solve the\nTest Task After Training\nIn line with our hypothesis, none of the children who did not\nreceive training solved the test. Further, all children younger than\n30 months also failed to solve the test, regardless of the delay\nbetween the training and the test and were signiﬁcantly more\nlikely to fail the test than older children ( p = 0.015). However,\neven in older children that received the training, the Score did\nnot depend on Age, as the main eﬀect of Age was not signiﬁcant\n[χ2(1) = 0.561, p = 0.454, R2 = 0.026].\nH2: Compared to Older Children,\nYounger Children Are Not Less Likely to\nSolve the Test Task After 24-h Delay\nContrary to our hypothesis, compared to older children, younger\nchildren were not less likely to solve the test task after a 24-\nh delay, as the Age × Delay interaction was not signiﬁcant\n[χ2(1) = 1.039, p = 0.308, R2 = 0.026].\nH3 and H4: After a Long Delay, Older\nChildren Interact Shorter With the\nFunctional Tool and the Relevant\nComponents\nContrary to hypothesis H3, older children who received training\ndid not interact longer with the functional tool and the relevant\ncomponents of the apparatuses, as the main eﬀect of Age was\nnot signiﬁcant [ F(1,74) = 0.13, p = 0.718]. Further, in line\nwith hypothesis H4, there was a signiﬁcant interaction eﬀect for\nAge × Delay [F(2,74) = 6.385, p = 0.003, R2 = 0.28]. However,\nthe eﬀect was partially diﬀerent than the predicted one. After\nthe short delay, there was no diﬀerence in interacting with the\nfunctional tool and the relevant components across ages, but\nafter the long delay, older children engaged in such interactions\nsigniﬁcantly less than younger children. Note that this eﬀect is\nopposite to the predicted one (see Figure 3).\nA more complex picture emerged from the analysis of\ninteractions with the functional tool and the irrelevant\ncomponents, since interaction Age × Delay was implicated\nin a three-way eﬀect for Age × Delay × Success ( β = 0.092,\nSE = 0.001, z = 147.51, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.105). Namely, after both\ndelays, with age, children that failed the test interacted more with\nthe functional tool and the irrelevant components (see Figure 3).\nThis was somewhat diﬀerent for children that solved the test.\nAfter the long delay, the older children interacted more with the\nfunctional tools and the irrelevant components than the younger\nchildren, but after the short delay, this pattern was reversed\n(see Figure 3).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 573730\nfpsyg-11-573730 October 2, 2020 Time: 11:52 # 8\nBobrowicz et al.

Flexibility in Problem Solving\nthey can transfer solutions that depend on prioritizing tool\nfunction over appearance across problems, regardless of the delay\nbetween the problems. Contrary to previous studies with so\nyoung children, language demands of the task were kept to a\nminimum, as children received puzzle boxes instead of stories\nand tackled the test without any verbal or non-verbal guidance\nfrom the experimenter.\nAnalogical Transfer Was Not Possible\nBefore the Age of 2.5 Years\nChildren younger than 2 1/2 years did not manage to solve the\nproblem, even if they learnt the correct solution on a perceptually\ndissimilar problem ten min earlier. However, this was not the\ncase for the children between 21/2 and 41/2, who, after learning the\ncorrect solution 10 min or 24 h earlier, could solve the problem\nregardless of the delay. Therefore, it seems that neither the delay\nnor the perceptual mismatch within the tool set impeded the\ntransfer at these ages. Given previous ﬁndings from analogical\ntransfer studies (Crisaﬁ and Brown, 1986), it is not surprising\nthat children younger than 21/2 years did not transfer the solution\nbetween two physically dissimilar problems, but it is surprising\nthat ability to transfer was independent of age in children between\n30 and 55 months of age.\nThe current analogical transfer task perhaps required simpler\nanalogical reasoning that other classical tasks, e.g., of the A:B:C:D\ntype (Thibaut and French, 2016). Typically, such tasks require\ndetecting how A is related to B (e.g., A ﬁts in B, the shirt ﬁts in\nthe suitcase) and then applying this relation to a pair of C and\nD items (e.g., C ﬁts in D, the toy car ﬁts in the box). This is a\ncomplex task that involves holding “online” and transferring an\nabstract rule, an operation that lies at the core of adult analogical\nreasoning. However, from the child’ point of view, the task is\nfairly abstract, requires well-developed verbal skills and does not\nallow any agency on the child’s part. On the contrary, in the\ncurrent task, children needed only to hold and transfer a concrete\nrule across one pair of items (A can be solved as B), use no\nlanguage and act as agents. This may explain why children’s\nanalogical transfer was independent of age in children between 30\nand 55 months of age. In the future, our task could be, however,\nused as an A:B:C:D task, as we devised several pairs of boxes, all\nrelying on the same rule: that both boxes in the pair can be solved\nwith the same tool.\nTransferring a solution across problems arguably requires\nthe ability to mentally represent objects and actions involved\nin the solution. To transfer the solution across two problems,\nchildren need to simultaneously consider the source problem,\nfamiliar but currently absent, and the target problem, currently\npresent but unfamiliar. In other words, the child needs to\nactivate a mental representation of the source problem in the\nservice of problem solving, which, according to neo-Piagetian\naccounts may be available in 2-year-olds at the earliest (e.g.,\nMorra et al., 2008). While our ﬁndings could be taken to\nindicate that representational ability is still immature before\nthe 30th month of life, hindering analogical transfer, 2-year\nolds have been shown to succeed in transfer tasks as long\nas the similarity between the problems is explicitly stated\nby the experimenter (Crisaﬁ and Brown, 1986; Goswami,\n1991), suggesting at least some capacity to mentally represent\nthe source problem.\nThat children below 30 months have diﬃculties in transferring\nacross conceptually similar problems has been shown before\nalso in other tasks, using deferred imitation (Herbert and\nHayne, 2000) and object search (DeLoache et al., 2004).\nAlthough analogical transfer may be available even for 2-\nyear-olds, they may require the experimenter to highlight the\nconceptual similarity between the source and the target problem.\nFor instance, Hayne and Gross (2015) showed that 2-year-\nolds can transfer a sequence of actions across perceptually\ndissimilar tasks, as long as the experimenter provided the same\nverbal label to highlight the underlying functional similarity.\nAfterward, children were also shown to map this similarity\nonto another set of problems, but only as long as the\nfunctional similarity was highlighted with the verbal label within\nthe initial set.\nTherefore, in principle, 2-year-olds are able to transfer\nknowledge across functionally similar contexts but may be less\nlikely to spontaneously notice the link between the source and\nthe target than 21/2-year-olds. The challenges posed by the target\nproblem can be also viewed from the sensorimotor perspective,\nas it demands activating and coordinating several sensorimotor\nschemes regarding essential features of the problem (the puzzle\nbox, its relevant components, the toy bee inside, the tools), the\ngoal of the problem (selecting a tool and retrieving the toy bee)\nand the strategy of arriving at this goal (applying the tool to\nthe components of the box; e.g., Morra and Panesi, 2017). Such\nactivation and coordination may limit children’s spontaneous\ntransfer below 30 months.\nAlternatively, our youngest participants could have failed\nto prioritize attending to relevant over irrelevant aspects of\nthe target problem. Between 2 and 2 1/2, children’s attention\nundergoes a transition, as it becomes increasingly governed\nby top-down (executive functions), not bottom-up inﬂuences\n(attractiveness and novelty of stimuli; Ruﬀ and Capozzoli, 2003).\nThen, the participants in this age range would focus to a greater\nextent than older children on the irrelevant aspects of the\nproblem. This was not the case, however, as the youngest children\ninteracted with the functional tool and the irrelevant aspects to a\nsimilar extent as the older children who failed to solve the test.\nIn fact, it has recently been shown that the capacity to attend to\nrelevant, rather than irrelevant, information in children around\nthe age of 3 years can be substantially boosted by jointly attending\nto the problem tasks (Psouni et al., 2019). Future studies should\naddress whether the experimenter jointly attending to the task\nwith the youngest children or providing verbal cues that highlight\nthe similarity between the source and the target might boost the\nyoungest participants’ capacity to analogical transfer.\nAllowing children to manipulate the tools in future studies,\neven in the youngest group, may further illuminate whether\nchildren’s motor programs for tools change with age. Since tools\nin the current study were made-up and their function was the\nsame for the source and the target, it is unlikely that previous\nmotor programs for familiar tools, e.g., a spoon, impacted on\nchildren’s tool-use ﬂexibility (Barrett et al., 2007). In the future,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 573730\nfpsyg-11-573730 October 2, 2020 Time: 11:52 # 10\nBobrowicz et al. Flexibility in Problem Solving\nhowever, our set-up could be used to study how robust tool-\ndependent transfer is when the function and motor programs\nassociated with the tools is manipulated across tasks.\nThe Interplay of Age and Memory\nOur ﬁndings suggest that once children are able to transfer,\nthey can do so also with a delay between initial problem and\ntest problem, beyond the 15-min limit identiﬁed by Scarf and\ncolleagues for 3-year-olds in another task (Scarf et al., 2013).\nChildren could not simply repeat the previously learnt motor\naction in order to succeed, as the training and test puzzles\nwere distinctively diﬀerent in that sense; instead, they needed\nto generalize the action to a diﬀerent looking problem. Thus,\nit is unlikely that children could solve the problem relying on\nprocedural memory (note also that procedural learning does not\ngeneralize well, see, e.g., Doll et al., 2015).\nInterestingly, our result mirrors the ﬁndings from Herbert\nand Hayne’s deferred imitation study with 30-month-olds, where\nchildren’s transfer was immune to a similar 24-h-delay (2005).\nIn another above-mentioned study, this performance was also\nachievable for 2-year-olds as long as their attention was drawn\nto the functional similarity between two perceptually dissimilar\ntasks, suggesting that 2-year-olds’ working memory resources\nmay suﬃce for analogical transfer (Herbert and Hayne, 2000).\nAssuming that working memory is not separate from long-\nterm memory, but rather a state of activation encompassing\ncertain information stored in long-term memory (Oberauer,\n2002; Pascual-Leone and Johnson, 2005), it is possible that once\nanalogical transfer is permitted by working memory maturity,\nit works equally well for the immediate and delayed problems,\nat least by 24 h.\nIn terms of outcome, children performed similarly regardless\nof the delay and age in our analogical transfer task, that is,\nchildren were equally likely to solve the test after 10 min and\n24 h. However, the analysis of the interaction patterns reveals\na diﬀerent picture. In the short-term, attending to the relevant\ncomponents of the problem was similar in children of diﬀerent\nages, and lower in those that did not solve the task than those that\ndid. In the long term, however, among children above 30 months,\nolder children attended shorter to the relevant components of\nthe problem than the younger children. Note that this was true\nboth for the children that failed and those that passed the test.\nTaken together, these results suggest that, even if children reach\nthe same outcome in the short and in the long term, retrieval from\nlong-term memory does not pose a uniform challenge in children\nof diﬀerent ages.\nWe posit that it is highly unlikely that retrieving a relevant\nexperience from long-term memory is increasingly diﬃcult as\nchild’s memory matures. Instead, we suggest that in the long term,\nolder children may adopt a more ﬂexible, explorative approach\nthan younger children, spending more time on interactions\nwith the irrelevant aspects of the target problem. Perhaps with\nage, the solution to the target problem becomes increasingly\nstraightforward and children seek additional ways of solving it\nbefore acting on the relevant aspects of the problem.\nThis reasoning seems to be supported by the analysis\nof interactions with the functional tool and the irrelevant\ncomponents. Among children that passed the test, the older\nchildren interacted more with the functional tool and the\nirrelevant components than the younger ones, but only in the\nlong term. This pattern was diﬀerent among children that failed\nthe test, since there was no diﬀerence in interactions with the\nfunctional tool and the irrelevant components across ages, both\nin the short and in the long term.\nRepeating the previously learnt motor action clearly did not\nsuﬃce for successful transfer, as focusing on the functional tool\nwithout focusing on the relevant components did not diﬀer\nbetween children that succeeded and those that did not, at\nleast in the short-term. In other words, it was not suﬃcient\nfor the child to pick up the functional tool and apply it\nto diﬀerent components; rather, the child had to understand\nwhich components matched the tool’s function. Further, children\nhad to transfer the solution acquired in a speciﬁc one-time\npersonal episode and ﬂexibly apply it to the novel situation,\nwhich requires episodic memory (Tulving, 2005). Therefore, the\npresent results suggest that the ability for non-verbal transfer\nacross physically dissimilar problems in young children has been\nunderestimated. It seems that between 2 1/2 and 41/2 years of age\nchildren can perform such transfers, using episodic memory,\nas long as the success does not require the comprehension of\nverbal instructions.\nLimitations\nThe manipulations introduced in the current experiment could\nnot disentangle between two possible reasons behind children’s\nfailures: a diﬃculty caused by analogical transfer or by the\nperceptual mismatch within the tool set. When the perceptual\nmismatch was removed, very few children improved their\nperformance, suggesting that the failures were predominantly\ncaused by the diﬃculty in analogical transfer. However, as this\nextra test involved the same children and followed immediately\nafter the test, failure to solve the task could also be due to a drop\nin children’s motivation after failure, interference between the\nperceptually incongruent and the uniform tool sets, or fatigue\ndue to prolonged testing. Future studies ought to disentangle\nbetween these possible explanations through, for instance, testing\none group of children with the perceptually mismatching tools,\nand another group with the same tools as in the training.\nIn the present study, group sizes for the youngest and\noldest children were small ( n = 10 and n = 9, respectively).\nSince it is possible that the youngest children were motorically\ndisadvantaged compared to older children, future studies might\ninclude a preferential looking test for the youngest children.\nAlternatively, to limit the motor involvement on the child’s\npart but retain the current setup, the experimenter could\nuse tools indicated by the child, as in Pauen and Bechtel-\nKuehne’s study (2016). However, the present experimental setup\nallowed executing multiple motor actions with the chosen tool,\nenhancing the child’s active involvement and independence\nwhile maintaining a minimal language task demand. Having the\nexperimenter handle the tools as instructed by the child would\nsigniﬁcantly increase language task demands, thereby hindering a\ncomparison of performance across age groups and children with\nvarying language abilities.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 573730\nfpsyg-11-573730 October 2, 2020 Time: 11:52 # 11\nBobrowicz et al. Flexibility in Problem Solving\nThe current design could not disentangle whether children\nattended to the perceptual diﬀerences between tool handles\nand disregarded them in favor of the tools’ functionality, or\nwhether they did not attend to the tools’ appearance at all.\nDrawing the children’s attention to the tools’ appearance would,\nagain, have resulted in increased language demands of the task.\nFuture investigations may opt to in retrospect ask the children\nabout the tools’ appearance, in an eﬀort to disentangle these\ntwo possibilities.\nCONCLUSION\nWe tested a novel set-up to investigate analogical transfer of\ntool use in 2–4 1/2-year-olds and showed that transfer between\nfunctionally similar, but perceptually dissimilar problems can be\nas robust after 10 m to a 24-h delay. Children below 30 months\ndid not demonstrate such transfer, in line with previous studies\nthat, like ours, limited verbal cues pointing to the similarity\nbetween the source and the target task. Interestingly, we found\nthat, even when children’s behavior in the test led to the same\noutcome regardless of age and delay, this behavior had diﬀerent\ntrajectories. Therefore, we posit that future studies should focus\nnot only on the outcome of children’s actions but also on\nbehavioral patterns that lead to those outcomes.\nThe ability of ﬂexible tool-dependent problem solving has\na remarkable impact on everyday life and decision making,\nboth in the local and the global context (Keen, 2011).\nRecognizing the principles for solution across physical and\nabstract problems allows for eﬃcient and timely action in\nresponse to grave and actual challenges, such as climate change\n(Keen, 2011). Understanding how children spontaneously shift\nattention toward relevant aspects of solutions and problems\ncould inform future interventions, on the one hand, enhancing\neﬃcient problem solving from a young age, and on the other,\nenhancing spontaneous focusing on relevant aspects of abstract\nproblems in adults. Furthermore, as analogical transfer of tool\nuse in the current setup did not require verbal instructions,\nthe pairs of problems and tools could be tested with clinical\npopulations of children and adults with speech and/or hearing\nimpediments or impairments.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nAll datasets generated in this study are included in the\narticle/Supplementary Material.\nETHICS STATEMENT\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and\napproved by Swedish Ethical Review Authority in Lund\n(DRN 2018/572, PI Psouni).
