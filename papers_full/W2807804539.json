Single trace operators in the conformal\n\feld theory (CFT) are identi\fed with states of the spin chain, and the dilatation operator\nof the CFT with the Hamiltonian of the spin chain. This allows the exact computation of\nanomalous dimensions and hence precision tests [ 2, 3] of the duality with string theory on\nAdS5\u0002S5 [4{6]. Excitations of the closed string are identi\fed as magnons. The magnons\nare visible in the dual string theory description [ 7, 8]. After projecting the closed string\nsolution to a plane (the so called bubbling plane [ 9]) and using coordinates suited to 1/2\nBPS supergravity geometries, the string worldsheet traces out a polygon [ 8]. The sides\nof the polygon are the magnons. Geometrical properties of these sides (their length and\norientation) determine the conserved charges (momentum and energy) labeling the magnon.\nThe S-matrix for magnon scattering is determined up to a single overall phase simply by\nkinematics [10]. Integrability then \fxes this phase. The S-matrix computed in string theory\nis in exact agreement with the S-matrix computed in the CFT.\n{ 1 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nHow much, if anything, of this story survives for string excitations of new geometries?\nThe geometries that we have in mind are the LLM geometries [ 9]. An LLM geometry is\ndual to an operator with a dimension that grows as N2 in the large N limit. Consequently,\ncorrelators of operators with dimensions of order N2 encode the physics of excitations of\nthese geometries. For operators with such a large dimension the planar approximation is\nnot justi\fed [11]. Consequently, mixing between di\u000berent trace structures is not suppressed.\nThe identi\fcation between single trace operators in the CFT and spin chain states is spoiled\nand it seems that the link to an integrable spin chain is lost. In this introduction we will\ngive some physical arguments which suggest that, at least for a subset of excitations, this\nis not the case. The rest of the paper then carries out detailed CFT computations that\ncon\frm the details of this physical picture.\nThe LLM geometries are dual to a 1/2 BPS sector of the CFT. This 1/2 BPS sector\ncontains all gauge invariant operators built from a single complex matrixZ. Since we study\nsingle matrix dynamics, there is a simple free fermion description, obtained by working in\nterms of the eigenvalues of Z [12, 13 ]. There is also a closely related description which\nemploys Schur polynomials in Z [13, 14 ]. We mainly use this second description as we\nknow how to generalize it when including more matrices [ 15, 16 ]. This is needed when\nstudying small \ructuations of the LLM geometries. A Schur polynomial dual to an LLM\ngeometry is labeled by a Young diagram with order N2 boxes [9]. An operator dual to a\nsmooth supergravity geometry has a Young diagram with O(1) corners and the distance\nbetween any two adjacent corners (that is, the number of rows or columns ending on the\nside between the two corners) is orderN. The string theory understanding of this geometry\nis that it is the state obtained from back reaction of condensed giant gravitons [17{19]. The\ntranslation between the CFT and string theory descriptions is direct: we read the rows of\nthe Young diagram as dual giant gravitons or the columns as giant gravitons [ 13].\nTo excite the geometry in the CFT description, add boxes at a particular corner of\nthe Young diagram describing the LLM geometry [ 20{22]. In string theory we understand\nthis as exciting the giants that condensed to produce the geometry. The description of\nworldvolume excitations of these D3 brane giant gravitons is in terms of some open string\n\feld theory whose low energy limit gives rise to a new emergent Yang-Mills theory [ 23,\n24]. Relative to the original Yang-Mills theory we started with, the space of the giant's\nworldvolume is an emergent space. The new emergent Yang-Mills theory may itself have\na holographic description so we might have new holographic dualities in this large charge\nlimit [23].\nThe intuitive picture sketched above suggests that excitations arising from any partic-\nular corner give rise to a distinct super Yang-Mills theory. We will study the planar limit\nof these emergent gauge theories, to provide detailed support for this intuition. To restrict\nto the planar limit consider excitations with a bare dimension of at most O(\np\nN), i.e. add\nat most O(\np\nN) boxes to any given corner. Concretely we will demonstrate three things\n1. An isomorphism between the planar Hilbert space of the original N= 4 super Yang-\nMills theory and the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge theory arising at\na corner. When restricted to the 1/2 BPS sector, these Hilbert spaces are in fact a\ngeneralization of the code subspaces constructed by [ 25] (see also [ 26{28]).\n{ 2 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\n2. Three point functions of operators in the planar emergent gauge theory vanish. We\ndemonstrate this in the free \feld theory. In the planar limit of matrix models the\nvanishing follows because to mix three single traces we have to break some index\nloops which costs (at least) a factor of N. This is a general conclusion true for both\nfree and interacting matrix models. Consequently we conjecture that our free \feld\ntheory result holds after interactions are turned on. Since operator product expansion\n(OPE) coe\u000ecients can be read from the three point functions, this implies the OPE\ncoe\u000ecients of the planar emergent gauge theory vanish.\n3. The correct spectrum of planar anomalous dimensions of the emergent gauge theory.\nWe know the planar spectrum of anomalous dimensions of N= 4 super Yang-Mills\ntheory. We \fnd the same spectrum for the emergent gauge theory. This demonstrates\nintegrability for the emergent gauge theories.\nNotice that since any CFT is determined by its spectrum of anomalous dimensions\nand OPE coe\u000ecients, and that in the strict planar limit all OPE coe\u000ecients vanish, this\ndemonstrates that the planar limit of the emergent gauge theories are planar N= 4 super\nYang-Mills theory. We will see that although these di\u000berent emergent gauge theories all\nshare the same coupling constant (which is expected since this coupling is equal to the\nstring coupling constant of the original string theory on AdS 5\u0002S5), they generically have\ndistinct gauge groups U( Ne\u000b). The rank of the gauge group Ne\u000b receives contributions\nboth from the \rux of the original N D3 branes that gives rise to the N= 4 super Yang-\nMills theory we start with and from the giants which have condensed. By considering a\nlarge charge state, its possible to have an emergent gauge theory with gauge group that\nhas rank larger than N.\nWhat we are \fnding is that a subset of the excitations of large charge states of theN=\n4 super Yang-Mills theory are equivalent to excitations of the vacuum. There are of course\nexcitations that go beyond the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory. The excitation\nis constructed by adding boxes to the Young diagram describing the LLM geometry. We\nmight add so many boxes that we reach beyond two corners of the Young diagram de\fning\nthe LLM geometry. The excitation is \\too big\" to sit on the Young diagram and in\nthis way we can detect features of the background Young diagram. These excitations are\nobtained by adding \u0018N boxes and hence do not belong to the planar limit of the emergent\ngauge theory - they are giant graviton like operators of the emergent theory. There are\nalso excitations constructed by adding order\np\nN boxes, with the boxes added at di\u000berent\ncorners [21, 22, 45]. These (delocalized) states can be described as strings with magnon\nexcitations that stretch between two corners. We will show that at large N these states are\ndecoupled from (localized) states in the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge theory,\nso that if we start from a state in the planar Hilbert space, the large N dynamics will not\ntake us out of this space. This is an important point to demonstrate since the coupling\nof the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge theory to other degrees of freedom will\nalmost certainly ruin integrability.\nThe free fermion description of the system is a powerful description because of its\nsimplicity. The large charge state corresponds to exciting the fermions as illustrated in\n{ 3 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nFigure 1. The free fermion description of a state labeled by a Young diagram. On the left we have\nthe Fermi sea corresponding to the AdS5\u0002S5 geometry. The states are simply \flled from the lowest\nto highest energy with no unoccupied states. On the right, the Young diagram corresponding to a\nparticular LLM geometry is shown. Each vertical edge of the Young diagram maps into occupied\nstates while the horizontal edges map into unoccupied states. The number of fermions that were\nnot excited at all is equal to the number of rows with no boxes. Thus, the excited state has broken\nthe Fermi sea up into a series of occupied blocks.\n\fgure 1. The idea that a subset of the excitations of large charge states of the CFT are\nequivalent to excitations of the vacuum has a natural interpretation in this free fermion\nlanguage. We are saying that exciting any edge of the blocks appearing in the excited state\nis equivalent to exciting the edge of the original Fermi sea. The only di\u000berence between the\ndi\u000berent blocks is their extent. By restricting to the planar limit we consider excitations\nthat are not able to detect that the Fermi sea is not in\fnite, so the extent of each block\nis irrelevant.\nWe will be using group representation theory methods to approach the problem of\ncomputing correlators of operators with a bare dimension of order N2. This approach has\nbeen developed in a series of articles [ 13, 15, 16, 29{38], which has developed a number of\nbases for the local operators of the theory. These bases diagonalize the two point function\nof the free theory to all orders in 1 =N, and they mix weakly at weak coupling [ 30, 39, 40].\nThey therefore provide a very convenient tool with which to tackle the large N but non-\nplanar limit of the CFT.\nThe representation theory methods sum the complete set of ribbon graphs. In this\napproach, operators are constructed using projection operators 1 of the symmetric group so\nthat the gauge invariant operators are labeled with irreducible representations of the group.\nSumming the ribbon diagrams of the free theory becomes multiplying these projectors and\n1These operators are actually intertwiners since they map between di\u000berent copies of the representations\ninvolved. For simplicity though the reader may think of them as projectors which are more familiar.\n{ 4 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nthen taking a trace. At loop level, we evaluate the dilatation operatorD. Evaluating matrix\nelements of D amounts to computing the trace of the product of commutators of elements\nof the symmetric group with projection operators. The central technical achievement is\nthat in the end computing correlators, i.e. summing the ribbon graphs, is reduced to\nwell de\fned (but technically involved) problems in group representation theory. A helpful\npoint of view in making sense of the details, which we introduce and develop in this article,\nentails classifying the various ingredients of the computation as background independent or\nbackground dependent. By something that is background independent, we mean something\nthat would take the same value on any inward pointing corner of any Young diagram dual\nto an LLM geometry, or even in the absence of a background, i.e. in the planar limit\nof the original CFT. These are quantities that take the same value regardless of which\ncollection of branes we excite, and this is what we signify in the terminology \\background\nindependent\". A quantity that is background dependent does depend on the collection\nof branes we excite. As we discuss in section 2 , after making this distinction it is clear\nthat the Hilbert spaces of the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory at any corner are\nisomorphic to each other and to the planar Hilbert space of the theory in the absence of\na background.\nOne of the original motivations for this study are the results [ 21, 22, 41] which suggest\nthe existence of new integrable subsectors of the CFT. We want to explore (and further\nestablish) the existence of these integrable subsectors. As discussed above, a key issue is\nto understand if the integrable sectors are decoupled from the nonintegrable sectors. It is\nuseful to bear in mind that integrability in the planar limit also depends on a decoupling be-\ntween di\u000berent subspaces: it makes use of the fact that di\u000berent trace structures don't mix.\nThanks to this decoupling, it is consistent to focus on the space of single trace operators\nand it is in this subspace that its possible to construct a bijection between operators and\nthe states of an integrable spin chain. The statement of this decoupling is coded into the\nplanar correlation functions: correlators of operators with di\u000berent trace structures vanish\nas N !1. Motivated with this insight we focus on correlation functions of the large N\nbut non-planar limits to establish the decoupling between integrable and non-integrable\nsubsectors. This is discussed in section 2, where we obtain a simple formula for the corre-\nlators in the planar limit of the free emergent gauge theory in terms of correlators of the\nfree planar CFT without background. Consequently the decoupling we establish is closely\nrelated to the absence of mixing between di\u000berent trace structures in the planar limit.\nWe extend these results to the weakly interacting CFT in section 3, giving arguments\nthat the spectrum of planar anomalous dimensions of the emergent gauge theory match the\nspectrum of planar anomalous dimensions of the original N= 4 super Yang-Mills theory.\nWe revisit the issue of coupling between integrable and non-integrable subsectors, arriving\nat the conclusion that the two are decoupled even after interactions are turned on.\nIn section 4 we consider the strongly coupled CFT, using the dual string description.\nWe explain why the excitations considered should be understood as open string excitations\nlocalized on the world volume of giant graviton branes. We also suggest how to describe\nclosed string excitations of the large charge state we consider. In section 5 we summarize\nand discuss a number of promising directions in which to extend this work.\n{ 5 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\n2 Free CFT\nOur basic goal is to organize and study excitations of an LLM background, using the\ndual N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory. Any LLM geometry is speci\fed by a boundary\ncondition, given by coloring the bubbling plane into black and white regions [ 9]. The LLM\nbackgrounds we consider have boundary conditions given by concentric annuli, possibly\nwith a central black disk. The LLM geometry is described by a CFT operator with a\nbare dimension of order N2. Concretely, it is a Schur polynomial [ 13] labeled by a Young\ndiagram with O(N2) boxes and O(1) corners. Large N correlators of these operators are not\ncaptured by summing only planar diagrams, so we talk about the large N but non-planar\nlimit of the theory. The excitation is described by adding J boxes to the background, with\nJ2 \u001cN. Consequently, we can ignore back reaction of the excitation on the LLM geometry.\nThe CFT operators corresponding to the background and excitation are given by\nrestricted Schur polynomials [15, 16]. Construction of these operators and their correlators\nbecomes an exercise in group representation theory. In section 2.1 we discuss elements of\nthis description, placing an emphasis on if the quantity being considered depends on or is\nindependent of the collection of branes being excited. This distinction will clarify general\npatterns in the CFT computations that follow.\nWe begin our study in the free \feld theory. The Hilbert space of possible excita-\ntions can be written as a direct sum of subspaces. There are subspaces that collect the\nexcitations localized at the outer or inner edge of a given annulus, or at the outer edge\nof the central disk. The excitations are obtained by adding boxes to the Young diagram\ndescribing the background, at a speci\fc location. They are also localized in the dual grav-\nitational description, at a speci\fc radius on the bubbling plane [ 21, 22 ]. Each localized\nHilbert space is labeled by the edge at which it is localized. There are also delocalized\nexcitations, where the description of the excitation involves adding boxes at di\u000berent lo-\ncations on the background Young diagram [ 21, 22]. We will not have much to say about\ndelocalized excitations.\nThe excitations belonging to the localized Hilbert spaces play a central role in our\nstudy. These are the Hilbert spaces of the emergent gauge theories. We give a bijection\nbetween the states belonging to the planar Hilbert space of an emergent gauge theory, and\nthe states of the planar limit of the original CFT without background. To show that the\nbijection takes on a physical meaning, we argue that correlation functions of operators that\nare in bijection are related in a particularly simple way, in the large N limit. This result\nis signi\fcant because the basic observables of any quantum \feld theory are its correlation\nfunctions and many properties of the theory can be phrased as statements about correlation\nfunctions. Thanks to the map between correlation functions, any statement about the\nplanar limit that can be phrased in terms of correlators, immediately becomes a statement\nabout the planar emergent gauge theories that arise in the large N but non-planar limits\nwe consider.\n2.1 Background dependence\nIrreducible representations of the symmetric group Sn are labeled by Young diagrams with\nn boxes. States in the carrier space of the representation are labeled by standard tableau,\n{ 6 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nin which we populate the boxes with numbers f1;2;:::;n gsuch that the numbers are\ndecreasing along the rows (from left to right) and along the columns (from top to bottom).\nA representation for Sn is given by specifying the action of any element \u001b 2Sn on the\nstandard tableau. We will use Young's orthogonal representation. For example, here is the\naction of the two cycle \u001b= (12) 2S4 on a speci\fc tableau\n(12) 4 3 1\n2 = 1\n3\n4 3 1\n2 +\ns\n1 \u0000\n\u00121\n3\n\u00132\n4 3 2\n1 (2.1)\nThe number 1\n3 that appears in the above equation is counting the number of boxes in the\nshortest path from the box labeled 1 to the box labeled 2. The only thing that matters is\nthe relative position of boxes 1 and 2. Consequently, \u001b has the same action on all three\nstates shown below.\n4 3 1\n2\n4 3 1\n2\n4 3 1\n2\n(2.2)\nFor example\n(12)\n4 3 1\n2\n= 1\n3\n4 3 1\n2\n+\ns\n1 \u0000\n\u00121\n3\n\u00132\n4 3 2\n1\n(2.3)\nThis demonstrates that the action of the symmetric group on the boxes belonging to the\nexcitation is background independent. In what follows we will use R (or r) to denote the\nYoung diagram describing the excitation and +R(or +r) to denote the Young diagram after\nit has been placed at an inward pointing corner of the Young diagram for the LLM geometry.\nWhen our excitation has more than one type of \feld, the gauge invariant operator is\nconstructed by restricting to the subgroup that permutes \felds of a speci\fc type. For exam-\nple, if we have nZ \felds and mY \felds, we would start with an irreducible representation\nR`n+ mof Sn+m and restrict to some representation ( r;s);r `n;s `m;of the Sn\u0002Sm\nsubgroup. Upon restricting ( r;s) may appear more than once, so we need a multiplicity\nlabel \u000b to distinguish the di\u000berent copies. Since we use only the action of the symmetric\ngroup to perform the restrictions, the multiplicity labels are also background independent.\nTo diagonalize the one loop dilatation operator [ 42, 43] traded the multiplicity labels for\ndirected graphs recording how open strings are connected between giant gravitons. These\ngraphs summarize basic physics coming from the Gauss Law on the brane worldvolume\n{ 7 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nthat is true for any collection of compact branes. This is why the multiplicity labels are\nbackground independent.\nThere is a potential \ry in the ointment that deserves discussion. In the absence of the\nbackground, R is used to put the Zs and Ys together while r is used to organize the Zs\nand s the Ys. In the presence of the background, constructed using Zs, we must replace\nR !+R and r !+r, while s is unchanged. The \frst m boxes labeled in the standard\ntableau made by \flling R are Y \felds, and are among the impurity boxes added to the\nbackground Young diagram. The remaining boxes are then labeled in all possible ways\nto give the states of the subspace. Imagine that n = m = 2. Two possible labeling are\nas follows\n4 3 1\n2\n4\n3 1\n2\n(2.4)\nOn the left we have the usual action of the symmetric group on the added boxes. For the\nstate on the right, we \fnd a di\u000berent answer. At large N, when the number of boxes in\nthe shortest path linking distant box 4 to any local labeled box (where the excitation was\nadded) is of order N, any permutation swapping box 4 with another box, will just swap the\ntwo labels. This is orthogonal to the state before the swap. We will always land up taking\na trace over group elements of the subgroup that permutes excitation boxes. For the traces\nwe need only states on the left contribute. As a consequence, although the action of the\nsymmetric group on impurities is not background independent traces over these elements\nare.2 Notice that the problem of resolving multiplicities is phrased entirely in terms of the\nsubgroup acting on Y \felds i.e. we can set the problem up so that the multiplicities are\nassociated to representation s. For this reason the above potential spanner in the works\ndoesn't threaten our conclusion that multiplicity labels are background independent.\nThe operators which generalize the Schur polynomials when more than one type of\n\feld is present are called restricted Schur polynomials [ 15, 29]. The Schur polynomial is\nconstructed using characters of the symmetric group. The restricted Schur polynomial is\nconstructed using a restricted character \u001fR;(r;s);\u000b\f(\u001b) [29]. Recall that the character \u001fR(\u001b)\nis given as a trace over the matrix \u0000R(\u001b) representing \u001bin irreducible representation R. For\nthe restricted character we restrict the trace to the subspace carrying the representation of\nthe subgroup (r;s). Because there are di\u000berent copies of ( r;s) in the game, there are many\nways to do this. The restricted character \u001fR;(r;s)\u000b\f(\u001b) is given by summing the row index\nof \u0000R(\u001b) over the \u000b copy of (r;s) and the column label over the \f copy of (r;s). This can\nbe accomplished by making use of an intertwining map PR;(r;s)\u000b\f which maps from the \u000b\ncopy of (r;s) to the \f copy of (r;s). This map can be constructed using only elements of\n2This is of course up to a factor which is determined by the dimension of the irreducible representation\nof the background. This factor is from summing over all the possible standard tableau obtained by \flling\nboxes associated to the background.\n{ 8 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nthe symmetric group that act on the impurities. In terms of PR;(r;s)\u000b\f we have\n\u001fR;(r;s)\u000b\f(\u001b) = Tr\n\u0000\nPR;(r;s)\u000b\f\u0000R(\u001b)\n\u0001\n(2.5)\nIn the presence of the background this becomes\n\u001f+R;(+r;s)\u000b\f(\u001b) = Tr\n\u0000\nP+R;(+r;s)\u000b\f\u0000+R(\u001b)\n\u0001\n(2.6)\nwhere \u001b is the same permutation as in ( 2.5). It is clear that the restricted character is\nbackground independent, up to the remark of footnote 2.\nThe operators of the planar limit are dual to strings and gravitons in the AdS 5\u0002S5\ngeometry. Since the restricted Schur polynomials provide a basis, any such operator can\nbe expressed as a linear combination of restricted Schurs. For simplicity we will discuss\noperators constructed from two complex matrices Z and Y, but it will be clear that our\nconclusions generalize for an arbitrary local operator. The de\fnition of the restricted Schur\npolynomial is [ 15]\n\u001fR;(r;s)\u000b\f(Z;Y ) = 1\nn!m!\nX\n\u001b2Sn+m\n\u001fR;(r;s);\u000b\f(\u001b)Yi1\ni\u001b(1)\n\u0001\u0001\u0001 Yim\ni\u001b(m)\nZim+1\ni\u001b(m+1)\n\u0001\u0001\u0001 Zin+m\ni\u001b(n+m)\n: (2.7)\nAn arbitrary operator OA can be expanded in the basis of restricted Schur polynomials as\nfollows [16]\nOA =\nX\nR;r;s;\u000b;\f\na(A)\nR;(r;s);\u000b;\f\u001fR;(r;s)\u000b\f(Z;Y;X; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ) (2.8)\nWe will argue that the expansion coe\u000ecientsa(A)\nR;(r;s);\u000b;\f are background independent. Imag-\nine that OA is the operator in the planar Hilbert space corresponding to some speci\fc state,\nlabeled by its dimension, R-charge and whatever other labels we need to specify it com-\npletely. The operator in the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge theory, dual to\nthe state that shares the same labels, is given by\nO+A =\nX\nR;r;s;\u000b;\f\na(A)\nR;(r;s);\u000b;\f\u001f+R;(+r;s)\u000b\f(Z;Y;X; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ) (2.9)\nIt is in this sense that the expansion coe\u000ecients are background independent. We will\nargue for ( 2.9) below by demonstrating that with this rule the correlation functions of\nthe set of operators fO+Agare given in terms of those of fOAg, essentially by replacing\nN !Ne\u000b. The two operators should then represent the same physical state since the\nphysical interpretation of any operator is coded into its correlation functions.\nWe now consider quantities that are background dependent. The two point function\nof restricted Schur polynomials includes a product of the factors of the Young diagram. A\nbox in row iand column j of a Young diagram has factor N\u0000i+ j. This quantity clearly\ndepends sensitively on where you are located within the Young diagram and is not simply\na function of the relative position of two boxes. The factors of the boxes added at di\u000berent\ncorners will depend on the corner and on the details of the shape of the Young diagram.\n{ 9 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nWe will see in what follows that all of the N dependence of the correlators comes from\nfactors, so that moving between di\u000berent corners shifts N !Ne\u000b, which changes the rank\nof the emergent gauge group. The only di\u000berence between the planar limit of the emergent\ngauge theories at each corner is this shift in N.\nA second ingredient in the two point function of restricted Schur polynomials, is a\nratio of the product of the hook lengths of the Young diagram. Assume that we have a\ntotal of C outward pointing corners and further that our localized excitation is stacked in\nthe ith corner. In the appendix A we prove the following result\nhooks+R\nhooks+r\n= hooksR\nhooksr\n(\u0011B)jRj\u0000jrj\n\u0012\n1 + O\n\u00121\nN\n\u0013\u0013\n(2.10)\nwhere jRjstands for the number of boxes in the Young diagram R and\n\u0011B =\niY\nj=1\nL(j;i)\nL(j;i) \u0000Nj\nCY\nl=i+1\nL(i+ 1;l)\nL(i+ 1;l) \u0000Ml\n(2.11)\nL(a;b) =\nbX\nk=a\n(Nk + Mk) (2.12)\nThe notation in the above formulas is de\fned in \fgure 2 . Formula ( 2.10) is telling us\nthat although hooks +R=hooks+r depends on the background this dependence is a simple\nmultiplicative factor that is sensitive to the shape of the Young diagram for the LLM\ngeometry and the number of \felds in the excitation that are not Z \felds. Its dependence\non R and r nicely matches hooks R=hooksr. Note that ( 2.10) is not exact | it receives\n1\nN corrections.\nOur discussion in this section has focused on operators constructed using only 2 \felds,\nZ and Y. The generalization is straight forward. For k di\u000berent species of \felds (which\nmay include additional scalars, fermions or covariant derivatives), with nk \felds of each\nspecies, we consider a subgroup Sn1 \u0002Sn2 \u0002\u0001\u0001\u0001\u0002 Snk of Sn1+n2+\u0001\u0001\u0001+nk. By including enough\ndi\u000berent species we can describe any operator in the planar limit of the CFT. It is again\nclear that although the action of the symmetric group on impurities is not background\nindependent, traces over these elements are and that multiplicity labels and expansion\ncoe\u000ecients are again background independent.\n2.2 Excitations of AdS5\u0002S5\nStart in the simplest setting in which no giant graviton branes have condensed and consider\nexcitations that are dual to operators with a bare dimension of order J with J2 \u001cN. This\ncorresponds to the planar limit of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills. In this limit there are\nimportant simpli\fcations. First, di\u000berent trace structures don't mix. 3 This is phrased as\na statement about correlation functions. To see this, consider loops constructed from a\nsingle complex adjoint matrix Z. In terms of the normalized traces OJ \u0011Tr(ZJ)=\np\nJNJ\n3For a careful study of this point see [ 44].\n{ 10 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nwe have\nhOy\nJ(x1)OJ(x2)i= 1\njx1 \u0000x2j2J + O\n\u0012J2\nN\n\u0013\nhOy\nJ1+J2(x1)OJ1(x2)OJ2(x2)i=\np\nJ1J2(J1 + J2)\nNjx1 \u0000x2j2J1+2J2\n+ :::\n!0 as N !1 (2.13)\nThe two point function of single traces is of order 1, while the two point function of a\ndouble trace with a single trace operator goes to zero. We have considered mixing between\nsingle and double traces, but the conclusion is general: to mix di\u000berent trace structures, we\nbreak color index loops to match traces structures and every time we break an index loop it\ncosts a factor of N. The fact that di\u000berent trace structures do not mix in the planar limit\nis an important result, ultimately responsible for the existence of the spin chain language.\nIndeed, the absence of mixing implies it is consistent to restrict to single trace operators\nand each single trace operator can be identi\fed with a speci\fc spin chain state. We will\nderive a formula for the correlation functions of certain excitations of a (heavy) operator\nwith an enormous \u0018N2 dimension in terms of the correlation functions of the planar\nlimit. As a consequence of this formula, we will see that simpli\fcations of the planar limit\nencoded in correlation functions are then automatically present in correlation functions of\ncertain excitations of the background.\nWe will make extensive use of the two point function of the restricted Schur polynomial,\ngiven by [15]\nh\u001fR;(r;s)\u000b\f(Z;Y )\u001fT;(t;u)\u000e\r(Z;Y )yi= \u000eRS\u000ert\u000esu\u000e\u000b\u000e\u000e\f\r\nfRhooksR\nhooksrhookss\n(2.14)\nIn the above formulafR stands for the product of factors of Young diagramR, while hooksR\nstands for the product of hook lengths of Young diagram R. This result is exact for the\nfree \feld theory, i.e. all ribbon diagrams have been summed. Thus, the above formula is\nreliable for correlators of operators regardless of their dimension. This is why its useful to\nexpress our computations in the restricted Schur polynomial language: we can tackle both\nthe planar correlators (with dimension \u0014O(\np\nN)) and correlators in the background of a\nheavy operator (with dimension of O(N2)) using a single formalism.\nThe computation of correlation functions most useful for our goals, starts by expressing\nthe operators of interest as linear combinations of restricted Schur polynomials. This is\nalways possible because the restricted Schur polynomials furnish a basis for the local gauge\ninvariant operators of the theory.

Taking linear combinations of these terms, we can easily construct, for example,\nthe operators that would map into the states of the spin chain.

The planar\napproximation to the correlation function in free \feld theory is obtained by truncating the\nabove exact result to its leading term in a large N expansion.\nUp to now we have focused on operators constructed using only the Z and Y \felds.\nThe most general operator will be constructed from adjoint scalars, adjoint fermions or\ncovariant derivatives of these \felds. The construction of restricted Schur polynomials with\nan arbitrary number of species of adjoint scalars and an arbitrary number of species of\nadjoint fermions was given in [ 46]. The construction of restricted Schur polynomials using\ncovariant derivatives has been described in [ 47]. Each power of the covariant derivative\nDp\n\u0016Z must be treated as a new species of \feld. If the operator we consider is constructed\nusing a total of k species of \felds, then the restricted Schur polynomial becomes \u001fR;frg;\u000b\f,\nwith frga collection of kYoung diagrams, one for each species. If we use ni \felds of species\nithe corresponding Young diagram ri has ni boxes. Young diagram r1 corresponds to the\nZ \feld. Young diagram R has n1 + n2 + ::: + nk boxes.

An example of a possible Young diagram B, with 5 outward pointing\ncorners is shown in \fgure 2 .\nAll of the horizontal edges Mi, and vertical edges Ni have a length of O(N). Excita-\ntions are obtained by adding J = O(\np\nN) boxes to B. These new boxes could be stacked at\nany of the inward pointing corners, below or to the right 4 of B. The possible locations for\nthe new boxes are labeled 0 to 5 in \fgure 2 . We will distinguish between excitations con-\nstructed by adding all extra boxes at a single inward pointing corner (localized excitations)\nand excitations constructed by adding extra boxes at more than one corner ( delocalized\nexcitations). In the free \feld theory, thanks to the fact that the two point function of\nthe restricted Schur polynomial is diagonal in all of its labels, the local and delocalized\n4We could also create excitations by eroding the outward pointing corners. We will not study these\nexcitations here.\n{ 13 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nFigure 3.

This Hilbert space can be decomposed as a direct sum as follows\nHCFT;LLM = HCFT;Local\nM\nHCFT;Delocalized (2.22)\nOur study will focus on the local excitations. The Hilbert space of local excitations can\nfurther be re\fned as a direct sum of subspaces, one for each corner of the background\nYoung diagram\nHCFT;Local =\nM\ni\nH(i)\nCFT (2.23)\nwhere i runs over inward pointing corners with the understanding that below or to the\nright6 of B count as corners. Each factor H(i)\nCFT in the above sum is the Hilbert space of\nan emergent gauge theory and is isomorphic to the space of local operators in the planar\nlimit of the original CFT, as we now explain. We do this by giving the bijection between\noperators of dimension J with J2 \u001cN and operators in H(i)\nCFT. The bijection maps the\noperator given in ( 2.20) above into\nO(B)\nA =\nX\nR;r;s;\u000b;\f\na(A)\nR;fr1;r2;\u0001\u0001\u0001g;\u000b;\f\u001f+R;f+r1;r2;\u0001\u0001\u0001g\u000b\f(Z;Y;X; \u0001\u0001\u0001 ) (2.24)\nThe coe\u000ecients of the expansion appearing in ( 2.20) are identical to the coe\u000ecients ap-\npearing in (2.24). It is only the Rand r1 labels in the restricted Schur polynomials in (2.20)\nand (2.24) that have changed. The Young diagram + R is obtained by stacking R at the\nith corner of B and similarly, the Young diagram + r is obtained by stacking r at the ith\ncorner of B. For an example of how this works, see \fgure 3 .\nThis mapping is a bijection. Operators with distinct labels are orthogonal. Operators\nwith distinct labels before the map have distinct labels after the map. Thus, the mapping\nis injective. Any operator with a bare dimension J and J2 \u001cN can be mapped to an\n5When we make this comment we have the operator/state correspondence of the CFT in mind.

What is important here is that, since each edge of the\nYoung diagram has a length of order N, there is no danger that when we stack R it\nwill not \ft onto the corner. Of course, the converse is also true: any excitation of the\nbackground can be mapped to an operator of dimension J by deleting the boxes in + R\nand + r1 which belong to B. Thus, the map is surjective. This demonstrates that our\nmapping is a bijection.\nIn the remainder of this section we will argue that the correlation functions of operators\nthat are in bijection are related in a particularly simple way, in the largeN limit.

The only di\u000berence, apart from the overall factor\n(\u0011B)nI, is that fR in the planar result is replaced by f+R\nfB\nin the emergent gauge theory\nresult. Now, recall that fR is the product of factors in Young diagram R and that a box\nin row j and column k has factor N \u0000j+ k.

Finally, recalling that the only\nsource of N dependence is in fR (for the planar correlators) or f+R\nfB\n(for the emergent gauge\ntheory correlators) we \fnally obtain\nhOA(x1)OB(x2)yi= FAB(N) 1\njx1 \u0000x2j2J\nhOA(x1)OB(x2)yiB = FAB(Ne\u000b) (\u0011B)nI\njx1 \u0000x2j2J\n\u0012\n1 + O\n\u00121\nN\n\u0013\u0013\n(2.34)\nThis demonstrates a remarkable relationship between correlators in the planar and non-\nplanar limits.\nThis result has a number of immediate applications. As we have stressed above, the fact\nthat operators with di\u000berent trace structures don't mix in the planar limit is a statement\nabout correlators. This no-mixing result allows focus on the single trace operators which\nis needed to develop the spin chain connection for the planar CFT. Our result ( 2.34)\nimmediately implies that operators that are the image of operators with di\u000berent trace\nstructures, will not mix. Thus, we too can focus on the image of single trace operators\nand then develop a spin chain description of the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory.\nStates of the spin chain that were identi\fed with a given operator in the planar limit will\nnow be identi\fed with the image of the same operator.\n{ 16 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nThree point functions of single trace operators are suppressed in the planar limit of the\noriginal CFT. Is there a similar statement for three point functions of single trace operators\nin the emergent gauge theory? In any Poincare invariant CFT the spacetime dependence\nof the three point function is \fxed by conformal invariance. We can thus simply factor this\ndependence out and consider the problem of the combinatorics of the Wick contractions.\nThis is also a complicated problem, but for some well chosen examples it can be solved.\nConsider the following correlator\nhTr (Zn1Yn2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 )Tr (Zm1Ym2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 )Tr (Zyp1Yyp2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 )i (2.35)\nThe Wick contractions are all between the \frst trace and the third trace, and between\nthe second trace and the third trace. In particular, there are no contractions between the\n\frst and second traces. For the combinatorics of the Wick contractions, we can treat the\ndouble trace Tr (Zn1Yn2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 )Tr (Zm1Ym2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 ) as a single operator and apply the bijection\nand treat Tr (Zyp1Yyp2 \u0001\u0001\u0001 ) as a single operator and apply the bijection. Thus, we have\nreduced the computation to a two point function. This two point correlator correctly sums\nthe contractions between the three traces with each other and with the background. The\nresult ( 2.34) then implies that this correlator, which is giving the three point function,\nis suppressed in the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory. Since OPE coe\u000ecients\nare read from three point functions, the OPE coe\u000ecients vanish in the planar limit of\nboth N = 4 super Yang-Mills and the emergent gauge theory. We have proved this in\nthe free \feld theory, for a speci\fc class of correlators. We conjecture that it holds quite\ngenerally and continues to hold when interactions are turned on. The usual suppression\nholds because we need to break index loops (which costs N\u00001 for each loop we break) to\n\fnd a non-zero correlator between three single traces. This does not rely on any detailed\nstructure of the interaction and is quite generally true for a matrix model. Of course, this\nis one point in our analysis that could be improved.\nOur argument in this section considers only the local operators. One might wonder if\nmixing between di\u000berent trace structures of delocalized operators is also suppressed or not.\nIn this case the argument is more involved. It is unlikely that there is a simple relationship\nbetween correlators of delocalized operator and correlators computed in the planar limit.\nExplicit computations using concrete examples support the conclusion that again, di\u000berent\ntrace structures don't mix. See appendix C for a discussion of this point.\nTo summarize, we have arrived at a rather detailed picture of the structure of the\nHilbert space. We have decomposed the Hilbert space of excitations of the LLM geometry\ninto a direct sum\nHCFT;LLM =\n M\ni\nH(i)\nCFT\n!M\nHCFT;Delocalized (2.36)\nRestricted Schur polynomials are orthogonal if their labels don't match. This immediately\nimplies that in the free \feld theory operators belonging to di\u000berent Hilbert spaces in the\nabove sum have vanishing two point functions and hence that the corresponding subspaces\nare orthogonal. We have further argued that each subspace can be decomposed into a direct\n{ 17 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nsum of orthogonal components, with each component collecting operators of a de\fnite\n\\trace structure\". Here the trace structure is read from the preimage of the operator\nunder the bijection ( 2.24). At large N these di\u000berent trace structures do not mix.\nOur study has focused on the free \feld theory. Of course, the bijection we have de\fned\nholds for any coupling. The free \feld limit has been used to obtain the relationship between\ncorrelators of operators and correlators of their images. It is this discussion that we will\nextend to weak coupling in the next section.\n3 Weak coupling CFT\nWe expect that the gravitational physics dual to the CFT is coded into the large N cor-\nrelators. Consequently, it is attractive if we can \fnd relationships between correlators of\nthe planar limit and correlators in the background of a heavy operator. In the previous\nsection we have exhibited relationships of this type, all in the free limit of the CFT. We\nexpect the dual gravitational description is simplest when the CFT is strongly coupled. It\nis natural to ask if the simple relations between correlation functions exhibited in the free\ntheory survive when interactions are added. Answering this question is the goal of the cur-\nrent section. We start with a careful discussion of the one loop dilatation operator, which\ndevelops the relation between correlators at one loop. This argument also gives insight into\nwhy the relationship we have uncovered between correlators holds even when higher loop\ncorrections are included.\nThe article [21] argued that matrix elements of the planar dilation operator are identical\nto matrix elements of the dilatation operator computed using local excitations, localized\nat corner8 i of the Young diagram for the LLM geometry, after replacing \u0015 = g2\nYMN by\n\u0015e\u000b = g2\nYMNe\u000b where Ne\u000b is the factor of the \frst box added to corner i. This again\namounts to replacing N !Ne\u000b so it is the rule we derived in section 2.3 ! We will revisit\nthis argument below adding two new improvements\n1. By carefully tracking what is background independent and what is not we will develop\na much simpler technical analysis.\n2. We will phrase the result using the bijection we developed in section 2.3 . The advan-\ntage of the rephrasing is that it supports the conclusion that the planar limit of the\nemergent gauge theory is planar N= 4 super Yang-Mills.\nThe \fnal result is remarkable: in the large N but non-planar limit we need to sum a huge\nset of Feynman diagrams. The net e\u000bect of summing the huge set of non-planar diagrams,\nis a simple rescaling of the 't Hooft coupling. This is in complete harmony with the physical\nargument we developed in the introduction.\nThe fact that we simply need to rescale the 't Hooft coupling has far reaching con-\nsequences: since the dilatation operator in the planar CFT matches the Hamiltonian of\nan integrable spin chain, we know that the dilatation operator describing the anomalous\ndimensions of the emergent gauge theory will also match the integrable spin chain. As\n8These operators belong to H(i)\nCFT.\n{ 18 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nlong as the dilatation operator does not mix operators that belong to the Hilbert space\nH(i)\nCFT with operators that don't belong to this space, we conclude that there are integrable\nsubsectors in the large N but non-planar limit we consider. Demonstrating the absence of\nthis mixing is one of the main goals of this section.\nBefore turning to a detailed technical analysis we will brie\ry review the evidence\nsupporting the above result. It implies that the anomalous dimensions of the operators of\nthe planar emergent gauge theory are determined in terms of the corresponding dimensions\ncomputed in the planar CFT. Explicit computations of anomalous dimensions of the\nemergent CFT, when developed in a perturbative expansion, con\frm this prediction both\nin the weak coupling CFT and at strong coupling using the dual string theory [ 21, 45 ].\nUsing the su(2j2) symmetry enjoyed by the su(3j2) subspace of local excitations, the two\nmagnon S-matrix has been determined and it agrees up to two loops with a weak coupling\ncomputation performed in the CFT [22]. The \frst \fnite size corrections to both the magnon\nand the dyonic magnon have been computed by constructing solutions to the Nambu-Goto\naction that carry \fnite angular momentum. These computations [ 22] again show that the\nnet a\u000bect of the background is a scaling of the 't Hooft coupling. This constitutes strong\ncoupling evidence for our result. Since these corrections are sensitive to the overall phase\nof the S-matrix, which is not determined by kinematics (i.e. the su(2j2)2 symmetry of the\ntheory), this is a non-trivial test. Finally, strings spinning on the three sphere that belongs\nto AdS5 have been considered in [41]. These strings are dual to operators belonging to the\nSL(2) sector of the gauge theory. Once again, the net a\u000bect of the background is a scaling\nof the 't Hooft coupling as predicted [ 41].\nIn the subsection that follows we revisit the analysis of [ 21], phrasing things in terms\nof the bijection of section 2.3 and paying attention the background dependence of the\nvarious ingredients in the analysis. This signi\fcantly simpli\fes the original analysis. We\npay careful attention to operator mixing, to give evidence supporting the conclusion that\nthe integrable subsectors are decoupled at large N. This closes an important hole in the\nanalysis of [ 21]. Finally, we consider how the one loop discussion generalizes when we\ninclude higher loops.\n3.1 One loop mixing of local operators\nFrom now on we normalize the two point function of our operators to 1. To simplify the\ndiscussion again focus on operators constructed using only Z and Y \felds. It is a simple\ngeneralization to include more \felds. Consider the mixing between two restricted Schur\npolynomials, O+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162(Z;Y ) and O+T;(+t;u)\u00171\u00172(Z;Y ). The capital letter O for the\nrestricted Schur polynomial instead of the \u001fstresses the fact we are considering normalized\noperators\nhO+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162(Z;Y )yO+T;(+t;u)\u00171\u00172(Z;Y )i= \u000e+R;+T\u000e+r;+t\u000esu\u000e\u00161\u00171\u000e\u00162\u00172 (3.1)\nThese operators are the image under the bijection of OR;(r;s)\u00161\u00162(Z;Y ) and\nOT;(t;u)\u00171\u00172(Z;Y ). The operators O+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162(Z;Y ) provide a basis for H(i)\nCFT. The start-\n{ 19 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\ning point of our analysis is the one loop dilatation operator in this basis [ 39]\nDO+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162(Z;Y ) =\nX\nT;(t;u)\u00171\u00172\nN+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162;+T;(+t;u)\u00171\u00172O+T;(+t;u)\u00171\u00172(Z;Y ) (3.2)\nwhere\nN+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162;+T;(+t;u)\u00171\u00172\n= \u0000g2\nYM\n8\u00192\nX\n+R0\nc+R;+R0 d+Tnm\nd+R0 d+tdu(n+ m)\ns\nf+Thooks+Thooks+rhookss\nf+Rhooks+Rhooks+thooksu\n(3.3)\n\u0002Tr\n\u0000\u0002\n(1;m + 1);P+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162\n\u0003\nI+R0+T0\n\u0002\n(1;m + 1);P+T;(+t;u)\u00172\u00171\n\u0003\nI+T0+R0\n\u0001\nIn the above expression Young diagram + R0 is obtained by dropping one box from + R\nand c+R;+R0 is the factor of the box that is dropped. Also, dr is the dimension of sym-\nmetric group irreducible representation r. Use n to denote the total number of Z \felds\nin O+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162 and nB to denote the number of Z \felds in the background. Also, nZ\ndenotes the number of Z \felds in OR;(r;s)\u00161\u00162 and m denotes the number of Y \felds. We\nhave n= nB+ nZ. The above result ( 3.2), (3.3) was derived using the convention that the\nY \felds occupy slots 1 to mexactly as shown in ( 2.7). In the standard tableau labeling of\nthe states in + R, the Y's would be associated to the boxes labeled 1 to m. This result is\nthe exact one loop result - we have not made use of any of the simpli\fcations that come\nfrom taking N !1. Notice that the N dependence of the matrix elements appears in\nc+R;+R0 , f+R or f+T. This immediately implies that we will again have a dependence on\nNe\u000b and not on N.\nTo proceed further, begin by discussing the intertwining map P+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162. Our goal\nis to give a careful argument concluding that P+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162 is background independent.\nThis map acts within a direct sum of the carrier space of + T and the carrier space of + R.\nIt gives zero on + T and projects the row and column labels of the + R subspace to an\n(r;s) irreducible representation of Sn\u0002Sm. Our convention is that the \frst boxes removed\nare associated to Y. This projection operator simply has to assemble these boxes into an\nirreducible representation s of Sm. The remaining boxes are already in + r. Thus, the\nprojection operator is\nP+R;(+r;s) = 1\nm!\nX\n\u001b2Sm\n\u001fs(\u001b)\u0000+R(\u001b) (3.4)\nIn writing the above projection operator it is understood that we are acting in the subspace\nof +R in which states are labeled by standard tableau such that labels 1,. . . , m only \fll\nboxes that belong to + R and not to + r. This is the subspace in which the remaining\nboxes are already in + r. To get the intertwining map, restrict the above row and column\nlabels. The key point is that the projection operator acts only on boxes associated to the\nY \felds. Restricting indices to get the intertwining map will not change this so that the\nintertwining map P+R;(+r;s)\u000b\f only has a nontrivial action on the Y boxes, that is, on the\nboxes that are removed from + R to get + r. With the discussion of section 2.1 in mind,\nits clear that P+R;(+r;s)\u000b\f is background independent.\n{ 20 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nTo evaluate the matrix elements of the dilatation operator, we need to perform the\nfollowing trace\nTr\n\u0000\u0002\n(1;m + 1);P+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162\n\u0003\nI+R0+T0\n\u0002\n(1;m + 1);P+T;(+t;u)\u00172\u00171\n\u0003\nI+T0+R0\n\u0001\n(3.5)\nThe intertwining maps I+R0+T0 and I+T0+R0 map from the subspace + R0 obtained by\ndropping a single box from + R, to the subspace + T0 obtained by dropping a single box\nfrom +T. As a result, these maps act only on the box in the standard tableau labeled 1\nwhich is associated to a Y and hence these maps are background independent. The results\nof section 2.1 imply that the above trace is background independent. Lets pursue this\nfurther in our current example. The intertwining maps P+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162 and P+T;(+t;u)\u00172\u00171\nact only on the boxes labeled 1 to m | all Y boxes, and the permutation (1 ;m + 1) acts\nonly on boxes labeled 1 or m+ 1. One is a Y box, one is a Z box and both belong to the\nexcitation. Consequently, in the above trace the very vast majority of boxes | those with\nlabels >m+1 and there are O(N2) of them | are simply spectators and can be traced over.\nRecall that we are focusing on operators that belong to a given emergent gauge theory.\nThe non-trivial structure of the matrix elements is determined by the Young diagrams R, r\nand sand it will agree with the non-trivial structure of the planar matrix elements - this is\nthe background independence. The only di\u000berence between the planar result for the trace\nand what we consider above, is that the sum over the inert boxes produces a factor d+r0\ni\nwhere +r0\ni is obtained by dropping a box from row iof r in +r while in the planar case we\nget a factor of dr0\ni\n. If we now consider mixing with operators outside of the emergent gauge\ntheory, in principle we could drop a box from + r at any location - even a corner that is\ndistinct from where our excitation is located. These matrix elements arise when there is\nmixing with states that don't belong to the integrable subsector. We will consider these\ncorrections in detail in the next section. Our conclusion is that these matrix elements vanish\nat large N. Using this result, we can restrict to mixing between operators that belong to\nthe planar limit of the emergent gauge theory. Consequently, the bijection of section 2.3\nrelates these operators to two operators, OR;(r;s)\u00161\u00162(Z;Y ) and OT;(t;u)\u00171\u00172(Z;Y ) de\fned\nin the planar CFT. We will now derive a relationship between the matrix elements for\nmixing O+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162(Z;Y ) and O+T;(+t;u)\u00171\u00172(Z;Y ) and those for mixingOR;(r;s)\u00161\u00162(Z;Y )\nand OT;(t;u)\u00171\u00172(Z;Y ).

This is then\na simple proof that at large N, the matrix elements of the one loop dilatation operator\nwith respect to states of the emergent gauge theory are given by replacing N !Ne\u000b in\nthe matrix elements of the planar dilatation operator, taken with respect to the preimages\nof these states.\nHow does this generalize to higher loops? The two loop dilatation operator has been\nconsidered in [ 48] and from that analysis it is clear what the general results are. The\nstructure of the matrix elements are very similar to the form shown in ( 3.3). One again\nlands up computing a trace. The same intertwining maps P+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162 and P+T;(+t;u)\u00171\u00172\nappear in the trace. The maps IR0T0 ;IT0R0 are replaced at L loops by maps which map\nfrom a representation R(L) obtained by dropping Lboxes from R to a representation T(L)\nobtained by dropping L boxes from T. There are also again permutations that act on the\nboxes associated to the excitation. Finally, the trace is multiplied by the square root of\nthe factors of the boxes dropped from R and T. Arguing as we did above, its clear that\nthe trace is background independent and the product of factors implies that the simple\nrule N !Ne\u000b again applies. These observations imply that our one loop conclusion goes\nthrough when higher loop corrections are included.\nTo summarize, we have found integrable subsectors in the largeN but non-planar limit\nthat we are considering. Each integrable subsector is an emergent gauge theory, with its\nown gauge group U(Ne\u000b). To complete this discussion, in the next section we will consider\nthe mixing between the integrable and non-integrable subsectors.\n3.2 Mixing with delocalized operators\nThe operators that belong to the planar limit of a given emergent gauge theory are localized\nat a given corner and de\fne an integrable subsector of the theory. There are operators that\nare not localized at one corner - they straddle two or more corners. If these delocalized\noperators mix with the localized operators they will almost certainly ruin integrability of\nthe emergent gauge theory. In this section we consider the mixing between localized and\n{ 22 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\ndelocalized operators. Our main result is that\nh\u001ejDj i= 0 j\u001ei2H CFT;Local j i2H CFT;Delocalized (3.7)\nat large N.\nWe make extensive of two basic observations. First, in computing the matrix ele-\nment (3.3), it is clear that the reason why two di\u000berent states can have a non-zero matrix\nelement, is because the permutation group element (1 ;m + 1) acts to change the iden-\ntity of the state. It is thus important to have a good understanding of the action of this\npermutation on a standard tableau. Since we are computing a trace which has the same\nvalue in any equivalent representation, we can carry this computation out in any conve-\nnient representation. In what follows, we will use Young's orthogonal representation. This\nrepresentation is speci\fed by giving the action of adjacent swaps which are two cycles of\nthe form ( i;i + 1). Given the matrices representing the complete set of adjacent swaps,\nit is easy to generate the rest of the group. Let j idenote a valid standard tableau and\nlet j ii$i+1 denote the state obtained from j iby swapping i and i+ 1. The content of\nthe box labeled i, denoted c(i) is given by b\u0000a if the box is in row a and column b. Our\nconvention for the standard tableau labeling is spelled out in the following example\n5 4 3 2 1 (3.8)\nThe rule specifying the matrix representing the adjacent swap is\n(i;i + 1)j i= 1\nc(i) \u0000c(i+ 1)j i+\ns\n1 \u0000 1\n(c(i) \u0000c(i+ 1))2 j ii$i+1 (3.9)\nIf boxes i and i+ 1 are located at di\u000berent corners, the \frst term above is of order N\u00001\nand can be neglected in the large N limit while the coe\u000ecient of the second term is 1, to\nthe same accuracy.\nThe second observation is a relationship between the loop order and the number of\nboxes that can di\u000ber in the Young diagram labels of the operators that are mixing. To\nadd loop e\u000bects, we consider Feynman diagrams with a certain number of vertices included\nin the diagram. Contracting two \felds in a restricted Schur polynomial with a vertex has\nthe e\u000bect of setting the indices of two di\u000berent \felds equal. This Kronecker delta function\nrestricts the sum over permutations in ( 2.7) from Sn+m to Sn+m\u00001. Two operators which\nbegin as distinct representations of Sn+m may well produce the same representation of\nSn+m\u00001. For this to happen, their Young diagram labels must di\u000ber in the placement of at\nmost one box. This is manifest in the matrix element ( 3.3), because the maps IT0R0 which\nappear are only non-zero if T0(obtained by dropping one box from T) has the same shape\nas R0(obtained by dropping one box from R). At Lloops we have added Lvertices which\nlands up restricting the sum in ( 2.7) from Sn+m to Sn+m\u0000L. In this case operators that\ndi\u000ber by at most L boxes will mix.\nAs a warm up example, consider the mixing of localized operators that belong to\ndi\u000berent corners\nh\u001ejDj i= 0 j\u001ei2H (i)\nCFT j i2H (j)\nCFT (3.10)\n{ 23 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nwith j 6= i. This represents a mixing between states of two di\u000berent planar emergent\ngauge theories, i.e. two distinct integrable subsectors. For concreteness imagine that these\ntwo operators are the images of R(r;s)\u000b\f and T(t;u)\r\u000e under the bijection described in\nsection 2.3. These two operators disagree in the placement of J \u0018O(\np\nN) boxes, since\nthe excitation which has J boxes is located at corner i for state j\u001eiand at corner j for\nstate j i. Thus, these two operators will start to mix at the J loop order. Further, for\na non-zero intertwining map IR(J);T(J) we need to drop the boxes that disagree between\nthe two operators. 10 This implies that, after expressing permutations that appear in the\ndilatation operator in terms of adjacent swaps, only the \frst term on the right hand side\nof ( 3.9) contributes. We need to swap all of the distant and local boxes which leads to\na suppression of O(N\u00001), for every box in the excitation. Consequently this mixing is\ncompletely suppressed at large N and (3.10) holds.\nWe are now ready to tackle ( 3.7). Consider a localized excitation, located at corner i.\nWe study the mixing of this localized excitation with a delocalized excitation, that has k\nboxes at corner j 6= i and is otherwise located at corner i. These two operators disagree\nin the placement of at least k boxes and so the \frst time they can possibly mix is at k\nloops. To get a non-zero answer, for the interwining map, we need to drop the boxes that\ndon't agree and this means that we must keep terms in which distant boxes remain distant.\nThis again amounts to retaining the \frst term on the right hand side of ( 3.9) and hence a\nsuppression of O(N\u00001), for every distant box. Consequently this mixing is suppressed as\n\u0018N\u0000k at large N. This demonstrates that ( 3.7) holds at large N.\nWe will end this section with a simple example illustrating the above argument. The\noperators which mix are labeled by the Young diagrams shown in (3.11). They have a total\nof 2 Y \felds and many Z \felds.\nA=\n\u0003\n\u0003Y\n\u0003\nY\nB =\n\u0003Y\n\u0003Y\n\u0003\n(3.11)\nA and B are the Young diagrams for the excitations in the background. They both have\nO(N2) boxes. The boxes labeled with a Y correspond to Y \felds and they may be labeled\n1. The boxes with a \u0003are Z \felds and may be labeled with m+ 1 = 3. For a non-zero\nanswer, the states in Awhich contribute have the bottom Y labeled with a 1. Only in this\ncase can we match the shape of B, after one box - the upper Y box - is dropped. Using\nDirac notation, the structure of the terms contributing to ( 3.5) are\nX\ni;j\nhA0;ijP+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162(1;m + 1)jA0;jihB0;jjP+T;(+t;u)\u00171\u00172(1;m + 1)jB0;ii (3.12)\nIt is clear that the only way that hA0;ijP+R;(+r;s)\u00161\u00162(1;m + 1)jA0;jican be non-zero is if\nwe keep the \frst term in ( 3.9) when the permutation acts. Since the only boxes labeled\nwith m+ 1 (the starred boxes) are distant from the bottom Y box in A, this is suppressed\nas 1\nN.\n10We use R(J) to denote a Young diagram obtained by dropping J boxes from R and similarly for T(J).\n{ 24 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\n4 Strong coupling CFT\nIn this section we want to explore the string theory interpretation of our results, adding to\nthe discussion of the introduction. The excitations we have considered in the CFT are all\ndual to excitations of the D3-brane giant gravitons that condensed to produce the geometry.\nThese are all open string excitations and we have demonstrated that they lead to emergent\ngauge theories. In this section we will motivate why adding boxes to the Young diagrams\ngive excitations that are localized to the brane, that is, why they are open strings. There\nare also closed string excitations in the dual string theory. We will give an example of a\nclosed string excitation. For relevant earlier literature see [ 49{52].\nWhy does adding extra boxes to a Young diagram as we have done above, lead to open\nstrings excitations? We can also phrase this question as: why does adding extra boxes\nto a Young diagram lead to excitations localized on the branes? Recall that there is an\nintimate connection between the entanglement of the underlying degrees of freedom and\nthe geometry of spacetime. This is manifested in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for entan-\nglement entropy in terms of the area of a minimal surface [ 53]. Further, Van Raamsdonk\nhas conjectured that the amount of entanglement between two regions is related to the\ndistance between them: the more the entanglement the less the distance between the two\nregions [54]. For a recent relevant discussion see [ 28]. To apply this to our set up, recall\nthat the Young diagram is an instruction for how an operator composed of many \felds\nis to be constructed. Each box corresponds to a distinct \feld and the indices of \felds in\nthe same row are to be symmetrized, while the indices of \felds in the same column are\nto be antisymmetrized. This will in the end produce a highly entangled state, with \felds\ncorresponding to boxes that are nearby on the Young diagram being more entangled than\nboxes that are more distant. The Young diagram becomes a convenient way to visual-\nize the entanglement so that boxes that are nearby on the Young diagram, are nearby in\nspacetime. To make these comments more precise we would need a better understanding\nof entanglement for multi part quantum systems.\nIf this interpretation is correct, then to produce a closed string excitation (which is not\nlocalized on the brane), we should construct an operator whose indices are not symmetrized\nor antisymmetrized with indices of the \felds making up the background. An example of\nsuch an operator is given by Ofkg = Tr (Yk1Xk2Yk3 \u0001\u0001\u0001 ). Since this is a closed string\nstate, we expect that the mixing of this operator with the background will correspond to\nclosed string absorption by a brane. Intuition from a single brane suggests that this is\nhighly suppressed because gs \u0018O(N\u00001) at large N. However, we are dealing with O(N)\nbranes so that we can't neglect mixing of Ofkg with the background. If this mixing were\nsuppressed, we would be dealing with an SU(2) sector of the planar Yang-Mills theory\nwhich is integrable. We will explore this issue at strong coupling using string theory.\nThe state dual to Ofkg should be a closed string moving in an LLM geometry. The\ngeneral LLM geometry is described by the metric [ 9] (i;j = 1;2)\nds2 = \u0000y(eG + e\u0000G)(dt+ Vidxi)2 + 1\ny(eG + e\u0000G)(dy2 + dxidxi) + yeGd\n3 + ye\u0000Gd~\n3\n(4.1)\n{ 25 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nwhere\nz= ~z+ 1\n2 = 1\n2 tanh(G) y@yVi = \u000fij@j~z y (@iVj \u0000@jVi) = \u000fij@y~z (4.2)\nThe metric is determined by the function z which depends on the three coordinates y;x1\nand x2 and is obtained by solving Laplace's equation\n@i@iz+ y@y\n@yz\ny = 0: (4.3)\nIn what follows we often trade x1;x2 for a radius and an angle, r and '.

This is dual to the gauge theory operator Ofkg =\nTr (Yk1Xk2Yk3 \u0001\u0001\u0001 ) described above. It is not dual to an open string and is hence not an\nexcitation of any of the emergent gauge theories we described in previous sections.

In writing this formula we specialized to a geometry with a central\nblack disk of area N1, a white ring of area M and a black ring of area N2. Consequently\nwe have a geometry described by three radii\n\u0019R2\n1 = N1 \u0019R2\n2 = N1 + M \u0019R 2\n3 = N1 + N2 + M (4.14)\nBy using these values in the expression for b(0) we \fnd 4.13 . If we take N2 = O(1) = M\nat large N we \fnd Ne\u000b = N1 = N(1 + O(N\u00001)). This is exactly as expected since this\nboundary condition corresponds to exciting so few giant gravitons that backreaction can\nbe neglected and we must recover the AdS 5\u0002S5 result as we have done. The above result\nshows that the closed string is exploring the geometry at r = 0 in the bubbling plane.\nThis region simply can't be explored by adding boxes to any corner of the background\nYoung diagram. The result depends in a nontrivial way on the details of the background,\nas we might expect for an excitation that is not localized on a speci\fc set of branes. This\nsupports our interpretation that this is a closed string excitation. For this closed string\nexcitation once again the only change as compared to the planar limit is the replacement\nN !Ne\u000b. This is probably only a property of the strong coupling limit.

The excitations are\nconstructed by adding boxes (representing the excitation) to a Young diagram with O(N2)\nboxes (representing the LLM geometry). Adding a box to a row of a Young diagram\nimplies that the indices of the added operator will be symmetrized or antisymmetrized with\nthe indices of adjacent boxes, so that the \felds associated to the boxes added are highly\nentangled with the \felds associated to adjacent boxes. Two objects that are entangled\nare nearby in spacetime, so that we produce excitations that are localized to the brane\nworldvolume. These excitations are open strings and hence give rise to an emergent gauge\ntheory. We have constructed a bijection between operators in the Hilbert space of planar\nN= 4 super Yang-Mills and operators in the planar Hilbert space of the emergent gauge\ntheory. Free \feld correlators of operators that are in bijection are related in a very simple\nway. This immediately implies that since three point functions of single trace operators\nare suppressed in the planar limit of the original free CFT, they are also suppressed in the\nplanar limit of the free emergent gauge theory. Since OPE coe\u000ecients are read from three\npoint functions, the OPE coe\u000ecients vanish in the planar limit of both free N= 4 super\nYang-Mills and the free emergent gauge theory. We have conjectured that this continues\nto be the case when interactions are turned on. By considering the weak coupling CFT we\nhave also given arguments concluding that the anomalous dimensions match the dimensions\nof an N= 4 super Yang-Mills with gauge group U(Ne\u000b), where Ne\u000b is read from the factor\nof the boxes associated to the excitations. Since any CFT is determined by its OPE\ncoe\u000ecients and spectrum of anomalous dimensions, this strongly suggests that the planar\nlimit of the emergent gauge theories are planar N= 4 super Yang-Mills theories.\nWe have been careful to stress that the planar limit of the emergent gauge theory agrees\nwith planar N = 4 super Yang-Mills. The stronger statement, that the emergent gauge\ntheory is N= 4 super Yang-Mills is not true: there are important di\u000berences between the\ntwo theories that are only apparent when going beyond the planar limit. The emergent\ngauge theory has gauge group U( Ne\u000b). If this gauge theory really is N=4 super Yang-\nMills theory we expect a stringy exclusion principle cutting o\u000b the angular momentum of\nthe giant graviton at momentum Ne\u000b. In actual fact, the maximum angular momentum\nfor a giant graviton is in general below this and it is set by the shape of the background\nYoung diagram. Similarly, dual giant gravitons can usually have an arbitrarily large angular\nmomentum. In the emergent gauge theory, the dual giant must \ft inside the corner at which\nthe emergent gauge theory is located, so there are no dual giant excitations with arbitrarily\nlarge momentum. These discrepancies arise because the giant graviton excitations detect\nthe structure of the bubbling plane. They can probe the di\u000berence between a black disk\nin a sea of white or just one ring among many or something else. So even in the large N\nlimit, the emergent gauge theory and N= 4 super Yang-Mills theory are di\u000berent. They\ndo however share the same planar limit.\nAn interesting technical result that has been achieved is the description of states when\nsome of the rows of the Young diagram describing the giant graviton branes are equal in\nlength. Previous studies [ 42, 43, 56] have considered the displaced corners approximation\n{ 28 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nin which the length between any two rows (for a system of dual giant gravitons) scales as\nN in the large N limit. In this situation, the action of the symmetric group simpli\fes and\nexplicit formulas for the restricted characters can be developed [ 42, 56]. Here we have the\ncase that many row lengths are of comparable size. Progress is achieved by uncovering the\nrelationship between the relevant restricted Schur computations and those of the planar\nlimit. We also allowed some Z \felds in the excitation which includes the case that the row\nlengths are similar but not identical.\nThere are a number of interesting directions that could be pursued. First, perhaps\nthere are new holographic dualities: each emergent gauge theory might itself be dual to an\nAdS5\u0002S5 geometry, in a suitable limit. There maybe a limit of the geometry that zooms\nin on the edge of the black regions in the bubbling plane to give an AdS 5\u0002S5 geometry\nwith Ne\u000b units of \fve form \rux. Restricting to excitations that belong to H(i)\nCFT is how\nwe restrict to the integrable subsector in the CFT. The limit that isolates an AdS 5\u0002S5\ngeometry would restrict us to the integrable subsector in the string theory. This is currently\nunder active investigation [55].\nThere are a number of questions we could pursue to further explore the dynamics of\nthe emergent gauge theory. As we have mentioned, the worldvolume of the giant gravitons\nis a distinct space from the space on which the original CFT is de\fned. How is locality\nin this emergent space of the emergent gauge theory realized? This may provide a simple\ntesting ground for ideas addressing the emergence of spacetime. We have argued that\nthere are integrable subsectors in large N but non-planar limits of N = 4 super Yang-\nMills. Can we \fnd further evidence for the integrability of these subsectors? Even more\nimportant, how can this integrability be exploited to explore the physics of emergent gauge\ntheories in interesting and non-trivial ways? For other promising indications of integrability\nbeyond the planar limit see [ 57{59]. Besides the local observables we have considered, the\nemergent gauge theory will have Wilson loops. It maybe interesting to explore these non-\nlocal observables.\nThe emergent gauge theory that we have explored in this article is only a decoupled\nsector at large N. What are the \frst corrections which couple the emergent gauge the-\nory to the rest of the theory? Presumably these corrections correspond to closed string\nabsorption/emission by branes. This is something concrete that can be evaluated.\nFinally, decoupling limits for gauge theory living on the intersections of giant gravitons\nhave been considered in [60{64]. It would be interesting to see if the methods developed in\nthis article can be used to clarify the emergent gauge theories arising in these cases, which\nmay shed light on the microstates of near-extremal black holes in AdS 5\u0002S5.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by the South African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department\nof Science and Technology and National Research Foundation as well as funds received\nfrom the National Institute for Theoretical Physics (NITheP).

The hook-length hR(i;j) is the number of boxes in the\nhook HR(i;j). To visualize the hook associated to a given box, imagine an elbow with its\njoint in the box and one arm exiting R by moving to the right through the row of the box\nand one arm exiting by moving down through the column. The hook length is the number\nof boxes the elbow passes through. We use hooks R to denote the product of hook lengths\nfor each box in R.

In this appendix we will compute the ratio of the\nproduct of factors for a Young diagram + R and Young diagram B. + R is obtained by\nattaching a smaller Young diagram R to the Young diagram B. The argument is rather\nsimple and most easily illustrated with an explicit example.\nConsider the Young diagrams shown in \fgure 4 above. It is simple to see that\nfR = N(N \u00001)(N + 1) (B.1)\nand\nf+R\nfB\n= (N + \u000e)(N + \u000e\u00001)(N + \u000e+ 1) (B.2)\nwhere \u000e= 1 = 5 \u00004. In general, if the top most and left most box of R is added to row a\nand column b of B, we will have \u000e= b\u0000a.\n{ 31 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nC Delocalized trace structures are preserved\nIn this appendix we compute correlation functions of delocalized operators. Our results\nsuggest that, in general, there is no simple relationship between correlation functions of\ndelocalized operators and correlation functions of operators in the planar limit, even in\nthe free CFT. The results of our computation do however provide evidence that mixing\nbetween di\u000berent trace structures is suppressed, even for the delocalized operators.\nTo keep the discussion simple consider operators constructed from a single \feld Z.\nThis will already probe aspects of the operator mixing issue. As a simple warm up ex-\nample, consider delocalized excitations constructed by starting with operators of the form\nTr(\u001b1Z\nn1)Tr(\u001b2Z\nn2). To construct a delocalized excitation, begin by writing\nTr(\u001b1Z\nn1) =\nX\nR1`n1\n\u001fR1(\u001b1)\u001fR1(Z)\nTr(\u001b2Z\nn2) =\nX\nR2`n2\n\u001fR2(\u001b2)\u001fR2(Z) (C.1)\nThe delocalized excitation is given by\nO(B)(\u001b1;\u001b2) =\nX\nR1;R2\n\u001fR1(\u001b1)\u001fR2(\u001b2)\u001f+(R1;R2)(Z) (C.2)\nThe Young diagram +(R1;R2) is obtained by adding R1 at the ith inward pointing corner\nand adding R2 at the jth inward pointing corner. This corresponds to localizing Tr(\u001b1Z\nn1)\nat the ith corner and localizing Tr( \u001b2Z\nn2) at the jth corner. It is now rather simple to\nevaluate the correlator\nhO(B)(\u001b1;\u001b2)(x1)O(B)(\u001c1;\u001c2)y(x2)iB\n=\nX\nR1`n1;R2`n2\n\u001fR1(\u001b1)\u001fR2(\u001b2)\u001fR1(\u001c1)\u001fR2(\u001c2) f+(R1;R2)\nfBjx1 \u0000x2j2n1+2n2\n=\nX\nR1`n1\n\u001fR1(\u001b1)\u001fR1(\u001c1) fR1(Ne\u000b;1)\njx1 \u0000x2j2n1\nX\nR2`n2\n\u001fR2(\u001b2)\u001fR2(\u001c2) fR2(Ne\u000b;2)\njx1 \u0000x2j2n2\n(C.3)\n= hTr(\u001b1Z\nn1)(x1)Tr(\u001c1Z\nn1)(x2)iN!Ne\u000b;1hTr(\u001b2Z\nn2)(x1)Tr(\u001c2Z\nn2)(x2)iN!Ne\u000b;2\nIn the above expression, fR(M) means the product of the factors of Young diagram Rwith\nN replaced by M. Further Ne\u000b;1 is the factor of the \frst box added to corner iand Ne\u000b;2 is\nthe factor of the \frst box added to corner j. The above result implies that the delocalized\ncorrelator has factorized into two factors, one for each corner on which the operator is\nlocated. Each factor is a correlation function. The value of N is replaced by an e\u000bective\nvalue of N for each corner. It is worth emphasizing that the expressions on the last line\nof (C.3) are exact. This result implies that trace mixing is even more constrained for the\ndelocalized excitation than it is in the planar limit. Indeed, in the planar limit we will\nhave mixing if the trace structure of Tr( \u001b1Z\nn1)Tr(\u001b2Z\nn2) matches the trace structure\nof Tr(\u001c1Z\nn1)Tr(\u001c2Z\nn2). For the delocalized excitation we will only have mixing if the\n{ 32 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\ntrace structure of Tr(\u001b1Z\nn1) matches Tr(\u001c1Z\nn1) and the trace structure of Tr( \u001b2Z\nn2)\nmatches Tr(\u001c2Z\nn2).\nThere is a second type of delocalized excitation we could consider: a single trace\noperator that is itself delocalized. As an example, consider a single trace operator that\nis distributed between corners i and j. To write such a loop we introduce the space time\nindependent auxiliary \feld Xa\nb , which has two point function\nhXa\nb Xc\ndi= \u000ea\nd\u000ec\nb (C.4)\nUsing this auxiliary \feld we can split any single trace operator into two traces, that re-\nassemble to give a single trace when the average over Xis performed. For example, we can\nreplace\nTr(Y5) \u0000! Tr(Y2X)Tr(Y3X) (C.5)\nPerforming the average over X, we recover our original loop\nhTr(Y2X)Tr(Y3X)i= (Y2)b\na (Y3)d\nchXa\nb Xc\ndi= Tr(Y5) (C.6)\nThe advantage of splitting things in this way, is that we can now follow exactly the same\nlogic that we used for the \frst example above. We will take this to be the de\fnition of\nthe delocalized single trace operator. For the general operator constructed from Ys, the\nresulting expression is of the form 11\nOA(Y) =\nX\nR1;R2;r1;r2\na(A)\nR1;R2;r1;r2\u001fR1;(r1; )(Y;X)\u001fR2;(r2; )(Y;X) (C.7)\nThe single extra box in the labels for the restricted Schur polynomial represents the aux-\niliary X\feld. We can now, following the example we studied above, attach R1 and R2 to\ndi\u000berent corners and in this way obtain the delocalized single trace operator. For operators\nthat involve more than two corners, we would need to introduce more than one auxiliary\n\feld. Concretely, for the case we consider, we have\nO(B)\nA =\nX\nR1;R2;r1;r2\na(A)\nR1;R2;r1;r2 \u001f+(R1;R2);(+(r1\n1;r1\n2); \u0002)(Z;Y; X) (C.8)\nThe notation \u0002 is just to re\rect the fact that we have not organized the auxiliary \felds\ninto representations of S2. We can now average over X in ( C.8) to obtain an operator\nthat does not depend on the auxiliary \felds. This averaging is easily performed using the\nmethods developed in [ 65]. It is straight forward, but tedious and messy, to check that\nmixing between di\u000berent trace structures of these delocalized excitations is also suppressed.\nLets illustrate the above construction with the simplest possible example: we consider\ntwo delocalized operators. The \frst, OA, is given by placing Tr( Y) at corner i and Tr(Y)\n11Imagine that our operator is constructed using n Zs. The restricted Schur polynomials needed for this\ncomputation involve restricting Sn+1 to Sn. There is no need for multiplicity labels when studying this\nrestriction.\n{ 33 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nat corner j. The second, OB, is obtained by distributing Tr( Y2) between the two corners.\nWhen the background is not present, the relevant correlators are\nhTr(Y2)(x1)Tr(Yy2)(x2)i= 2N2\njx1 \u0000x2j4\nhTr(Y)2(x1)Tr(Yy)2(x2)i= 2N2\njx1 \u0000x2j4\nhTr(Y)2(x1)Tr(Yy2)(x2)i= 2N\njx1 \u0000x2j4 (C.9)\nIt is clear that the last correlator, which mixes di\u000berent trace structures, is down by a\nfactor of N. If we had normalized the two point functions to one, the last correlator above\nvanishes at large N which shows that di\u000berent trace structures don't mix. The delocalized\noperator with Tr(Y) at corner i and Tr(Y) at corner j is obtained by adding a single box\nat corner iof B and a single box at corner j. Denote the factor of the box added at corner\ni by Ne\u000b;1 and the factor of the box added at corner j by Ne\u000b;2. It is a simple matter\nto \fnd\nhO(B)\nA (x1)O(B)\nA (x2)yi= \u0011B~\u0011B\nNe\u000b;1Ne\u000b;2\njx1 \u0000x2j4 (C.10)\nin complete agreement with ( C.3). The coe\u000ecient \u0011B~\u0011B is an order 1 number that arises\nfrom computing the ratios of hooks. After averaging over the X\felds we \fnd that O(B)\nB (x2)\nis a sum of two terms. One is clearly leading and has coe\u000ecient\nq\n1 \u0000 1\n(Ne\u000b;1\u0000Ne\u000b;2)2 . The\nsubleading term have coe\u000ecient 1\nNe\u000b;1\u0000Ne\u000b;2\n. The leading term involves a twisted character\nin the notation of [29], while the subleading term is a normal restricted character. We \fnd\nthat both terms contribute to the correlator\nhO(B)\nB (x1)O(B)\nB (x2)yi= \u0011B~\u0011B\nNe\u000b;1Ne\u000b;2\njx1 \u0000x2j4 (C.11)\nwhile only the subleading term contributes to the mixed correlator\nhO(B)\nA (x1)O(B)\nB (x2)yi= \u0011B~\u0011B\nNe\u000b;1Ne\u000b;2\n(Ne\u000b;1 \u0000Ne\u000b;2)jx1 \u0000x2j4 (C.12)\nSince Ne\u000b;1 \u0000Ne\u000b;2 is of order N, this clearly demonstrates the suppression. Although there\nis little doubt that mixing between di\u000berent trace structures is suppressed for the general\ndelocalized excitations, at this point in time we do not have a simple general argument for\nthis conclusion.\nD Localized and delocalized mixing at one loop\nIn this appendix we study a simple example of mixing between a localized and a delocalzied\noperator at one loop. Since we don't want a selection rule to prevent the operators from\nmixing, we need to consider operators that di\u000ber in the placement of at most one box.\nTo make the computation as transparent as possible choose particularly simple operators.\n{ 34 {\nJHEP07(2018)146\nOur goal is to show that this mixing is of order N\u00001. This is a simple illustration that the\nmixing between a delocalized operator and a local operator, is suppressed at large N.\nThe local operator that we consider is O+ ;(+ ; )(Z;Y ). The representation\nproduces (+ ; ) once upon restricting from S4 to S2 \u0002S2 so that there is no need\nfor multiplicity labels. Lets assume that this excitation is localized at corner i. For the\ndelocalized operator, we assume that we have ( ;( ; )) at corner iand ;(\u0001; ) at corner\nj. For this example we can evaluate the matrix element ( 3.3) exactly. The result is\nN+ ;(+ ; );+\n\u0010\ni; j\n\u0011\n;(+ i;( i; j)) = \u0015e\u000b;i\n4\u0019\ns\nNe\u000b;i\nNe\u000b;j\n1\nNe\u000b;j \u0000Ne\u000b;i\n\u0012\n1 + O\n\u00121\nN\n\u0013\u0013\n(D.1)\nwhere Ne\u000b;i is the factor of the \frst box added at corner i, Ne\u000b;j is the factor of the \frst\nbox added at corner j and \u0015e\u000b;i \u0011g2\nYMNe\u000b;i. The fact that this mixing is of order N\u00001 is\nin perfect accord with the arguments of section 3.2 .\nE Correcting the planar limit\nThe emergent gauge theory has 't Hooft coupling g2\nYMNe\u000b with g2\nYM the coupling of the\noriginal CFT. It is natural to ask if (non-planar) higher genus corrections are suppressed\nby powers of N or powers of Ne\u000b. This appendix gives a discussion of the issue.\nThe article [ 66] studied excitation of the annulus LLM background, with boundary\ncondition given by a single black annulus (of area N) with a central white disk (of area\nM). The Young diagram describing this geometry has a total of N rows and M columns. A\nsimple and clean argument shows that the 1/2 BPS correlators, with excitations constructed\nusing only Z \felds, admit an expansion with N\u00002\ne\u000b playing the role of the genus counting\nparameter [66]. In the 1/2 BPS sector, this result generalizes to multi ring geometries and\nagain the genus counting parameter is N\u00002\ne\u000b .\nTo go beyond the half BPS sector the result ( 2.34) can be used. After rescaling the\n\felds which are not Z \felds, by a factor of 1 =p\u0011B, we \fnd a product of two terms\nhOA(x1)OB(x2)yiB = FAB(Ne\u000b) 1\njx1 \u0000x2j2J\n\u0012\n1 + O\n\u00121\nN\n\u0013\u0013\n(E.1)\nThe \frst factor on the r.h.s. above admits an expansion inN\u00001\ne\u000b . The second factor does not.\nThus, in general our amplitude can't be developed as a series in the two small parameters\n\u0015e\u000b and N\u00002\ne\u000b .\nOpen Access.
