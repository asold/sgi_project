Introduction\n1.1 The Speciﬁcity of Wood Machining Tools and the Choice\nof Nitriding Technology\nThe speciﬁcity of machining conditions of wood and wood-\nderivative materials consists of simultaneous occurrence of\nseveral factors that contribute to intensive wear of woodwork-\ning tools. These are (Ref1-3):\n• application of very high rate of feed,\n• extremely sharp cutting edges of the tools,\n• intensive abrasive wear and high working temperature,\n• low thermal conductivity and high anisotropy of mechani-\ncal properties of the machined material.\nLow alloy and high speed steels are common materials used\nfor planing and shaping knives fabrication. Because of the\nadvantageous features of these steel grades, i.e., relatively low\nprice and easy manufacturing of special knifes, e.g., very long,\nwith extremely low wedge angles or with special complex\nshapes, they cannot be replaced in many applications by any\nother harder and more abrasion resistant material like stellites,\ncarbides, or PCD (Ref3, 4).\nResearch described in the paper concerns development of\nthe nitriding technology of planing knives made of high speed\nsteel (HSS) AISI M2. Most nitriding systems operate with the\nsubstrates maintained at cathodic potential. This technique is\nreferred to as direct current plasma nitriding (DCPN). However,\nit is also possible to produce a nitriding effect while the\nsubstrates are separated from direct plasma, where active\nnitriding species are produced. Such a method is utilized in\npost-discharge nitriding and in the newest plasma nitriding\ntechnique—Active Screen Plasma Nitriding (ASPN) (Ref5-9).\nIn the ASPN technology, developed by Georges (Ref10),\nthe high potential is applied to a mesh screen (cathodic cage)\nsurrounding the parts to be treated. The ASPN technique is\nbased on the general principle of post-discharge nitrid-\ning—plasma species are generated at the active screen and\nﬂow through it towards the nitrided substrates (Ref5, 11, 12).\nSubstrates are placed on the central worktable, which is\ninsulated from the screen (cathode) and from earthed chamber\nwalls (anode). Radiation from the surrounding screen heats the\nsubstrates to the nitriding temperature. Working gaseous\nmixture enters between the chamber walls and the screen and\nis ionized in the discharge operated on the screen. The\nproduced plasma contains a mixture of highly energetic ions,\nelectrons and excited neutral gaseous particles. The gas ﬂow\nhas been intentionally directed to induce the motion of active\nparticles through the mesh screen and the center of the chamber\ntowards the center of the worktable, from where it is pumped\nout. An additional power supply can be used to bias the\nworktable and treated substrates relative to the screen.\nThe main technological consequence of different discharge\nconﬁgurations in DCPN and ASPN systems is that in DCPN\ntechnique nitrogen mass transfer depends on the discharge\ncurrent density which is the highest at the blades of cutting\nJ.

In contrast to the DCPN, in ASPN\ntechnique the edge effect does not occur—there is no local\noverheating and overnitriding of tool blades, therefore this\ntechnique is more suitable for nitriding cutting tools with very\nsharp wedge angles, such as woodworking tools and was used\nin the research described in the paper.\n1.2 The Aim and the Scope of the Research\nThe aim of the research was to develop technological\nparameters for bright nitriding of woodworking planing knives\nmade of HSS AISI M2 in the newly built ASPN device. In\norder to speed up the process of the nitriding parameters\noptimization the design of experiments using the Taguchi\napproach was applied for development of the plan of exper-\niments and elaboration of obtained experimental results.\nTaguchi method was developed for experimental optimization\nof multiparameter technological processes and allows to reduce\nsigniﬁcantly the number of experiments necessary to study the\neffect of particular process parameters on the ﬁnal product of\nthe process (Ref13). The method proved to be very effective in\noptimization of surface engineering processes (Ref14-17). The\nTaguchi method uses the summary statistic g called signal-\nto-noise (S/N) ratio, which allows to evaluate the inﬂuence of\nprocess parameters on the obtained properties of the product.\nThe statistical analysis of S/N ratio and analysis of the\nexperimental data using the analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nprovide information about statistically signiﬁcant factors of the\nprocess and allow to ﬁnd optimum levels of process parameters\n(Ref 16). The value ofg (S/N) is calculated from the formula\nthat expresses the criterion for the quality characteristic to be\noptimized. When it is appropriate to maximize certain desirable\ncharacteristics of the product the criterion/C212the larger-the-better/C213\nis used and the signal-to-noise ratiog is given by the formula:\ng ¼/C0 10 log\n10\n1\nn\nXn\ni¼1\n1\ny2\ni\n !\n:\nIn the case when it is appropriate to minimize certain\nundesirable characteristics of the product the criterion /C212the\nsmaller-the-better/C213is applied and the formula forg calculation\nis:\ng ¼/C0 10 log10\n1\nn\nXn\ni¼1\ny2\ni\n !\n:\nIn both formulasy is the quality characteristic. Note that the\nsummary statistics g are formulated in such a way that\nindependently of the type of the problem the aim of the\noptimization procedure is maximization ofg (signal-to-noise\nratio S/N).\nFor planning experiments within the Taguchi/C213s procedure\northogonal arrays are used—the system of experimental plans\n(tables) that allow the calculation of the maximum number of\nindependent (orthogonal) main characteristic of the product\nwith a minimum number of experiments. Within described\nresearch the computer programme STATISTICA developed by\nStatSoft\n/C210 was used for generation of the experimental plan,\nstatistical analysis of the results and calculation of the optimal\nparameters of the ASPN process.\n2. Experimental\n2.1 The ASPN Device and Nitrided Tools\nNitriding processes were carried out in an own construction\nASPN device, developed and manufactured in the Institute of\nMechatronics, Nanotechnology and Vacuum Technique of the\nKoszalin University of Technology. The view and the schematic\ndiagram of the device are presented in Fig. 1(a) and (b),\nrespectively. The vacuum chamber of the device has a diameter\nof 800 mm and a height of 1000 mm. The main elements of the\ntechnological equipment installed inside the vacuum chamber\nare:\n– system of gaseous atmosphere supply and evacuation con-\ntaining gas inlet located axially under the upper cover of\nthe chamber, gas deﬂector of a diameter of 660 mm and\ngas outlet located axially in the center of the worktable,\nFig. 1 The ASPN device used in the research: (a) the general view,\n(b) the schematic diagram\nJournal of Materials Engineering and Performance Volume 22(2) February 2013—411\n– system of discharge electrodes containing mesh active\nscreen (cathode) 620 mm in diameter and 490 mm high\nand the anode of a diameter of 720 mm,\n– worktable of a diameter of 600 mm,\n– substrate holder.\nPlaning knives made of HSS AISI M2 were used as substrates\nin all the experiments. The knives, selected from normal\nproduction batch, were 100 mm long, 30 mm wide, 3 mm thick\nand had the wedge angle of 41/C176 . They were quenched and\ntempered to the hardness of 62± 1 HRC and pre-sharpened by\nthe producer. No surface ﬁnish of the knives was applied before\nnitriding—the knives were only cleaned using standard PVD\ncleaning procedure and then installed in the substrate holder.\n2.2 Development and Optimization of the ASPN\nProcess Parameters\nThe optimization of the ASPN process parameters has been\ndone in two series of experiments planned and carried out\naccording to the Taguchi approach. The ﬁrst series contained\nnine experiments planned using the orthogonal table L9\n(3\n4)—four process parameters at three value levels. The\nparameters optimized in the ﬁrst experimental series were:\nprocess duration, composition of the gaseous atmosphere, the\nsubstrate BIAS voltage and the substrate temperature (Table1).\nThe mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen were used as nitriding\natmospheres, but for safety reasons the maximum percentage\ncontent of hydrogen was limited to 50%, therefore in the\nprocesses carried out at the lowest nitrogen content argon was\nadded to the nitriding atmosphere. The pressure of the gaseous\natmosphere during nitriding and the conditions of heating and\ncooling phases were set constant (Table2). The plan of nine\nexperiments prepared according to the Taguchi/C213s orthogonal\ntable L9 (3\n4) is presented in detail in Table3.\nAs measures of the nitrided layers quality the total layer\nthickness, compound layer thickness and the fracture toughness\ncoefﬁcient were used. The aim of the ﬁrst stage of the process\noptimization was to achieve the nitrided layer without the\ncompound zone, but with maximum possible thickness and\nmaximum fracture toughness coefﬁcient. Based on the results\nobtained in the ﬁrst series of experiments, in the second series\nthe substrate BIAS voltage, the substrate temperature and\natmosphere total ﬂow during nitriding phase were ﬁxed at the\nvalues: BIAS =/C0 100 V ,T =5 0 0/C176 C, Q\nR = 1400 mL/min. The\noptimized parameters were: process duration, composition of\nthe gaseous atmosphere, and the pressure of the gaseous\natmosphere (Table 4). The parameters of heating and cooling\nphases were kept at the same levels as in the ﬁrst series.\nAccording to the Taguchi approach for three parameters at two\nvalue levels the orthogonal table L4 (2\n3) was applied and the\nsequence of four experiments was performed (Table5). In the\nsecond part of the optimization procedure the total layer thickness,\nsurface hardness, and the fracture toughness coefﬁcient were used\nas measures of the nitrided layers quality. After execution of both\nexperimental series ﬁnal experiments were carried, which allowed\nﬁne adjustment of the ASPN process parameters.\n2.3 Investigation of the Nitrided Layers Properties\nBesides the properties used in both experimental series as\nmeasures of the layers quality, i.e., total layer thickness,\ncompound layer thickness, fracture toughness coefﬁcient and\nsurface hardness, the phase composition of the layers, their\nhardness proﬁles and metallographic structure were investi-\ngated. Total thickness of the layers and the thickness of the\ncompound zones were determined optically on the etched\nmicrosection of the layers using metallographic microscope\nNikon MA 200. Fracture toughness coefﬁcient was determined\naccording to the procedure given in Ref18 from the formula:\nK\nIc ¼ 0:0319 P\nal1=2\n/C18/C19\nwhere P is the indentation load, a the mean diagonal half\nlength, and l the mean crack length.\nSurface hardness of the nitrided substrates was measured\nwith Future-Tech Vickers hardness tester FV-700 at the applied\nload of 100 N (HV10), whereas hardness proﬁles of the layers\nwere determined on the microsections of the layers using\nnanohardness tester Fischerscope HM 2000 XYp at the applied\nload of 500 mN (HV0.05). The phase composition of the layers\nwas determined by XRD technique with diffractometer DRON\n2.0 using Co Ka radiation.\nThe results of the optimization procedure were veriﬁed by the\ntools/C213behavior in the sharpening operation performed according\nto normal industrial practice after ﬁtting the knives in the 8 knife\nhydro head. Sharpening was performed using Weinig Rondamat\n980 Automatic Grinder working according to standard procedure\nof planing knives sharpening.

Results and Discussion\n3.1 Results of the First Series of Experiments Executed\nAccording to Taguchi /C213s Orthogonal Table L9 (3 4)\nThe transverse cross-section of the planing knife after\nnitriding is presented in Fig. 2(a). During sharpening the\nnitrided layer is removed from the clearance face of the knife\nand only the rake face remains hardened (Fig. 2b). The\nexemplary microsection of the nitrided layer after measurement\nof the microhardness distribution is shown in Fig.2(c). The\nproperties of the nitrided layers created in the processes\nperformed within the ﬁrst series of experiments are summarized\nin Fig.3. The phase composition and structure of the layers are\ngiven in Fig.3(a) and (b). X-ray diffraction patterns presented\nin Fig.3(a) indicate that the created layers consist of diffusion\nzone of nitrogen solutiona-Fe(N) and the compound zone of\niron nitride c¢-Fe\n4N, but no iron nitride e-Fe2-3N of higher\nnitrogen content was found. Besides the peaks froma-Fe(N)\nand c¢-Fe4N phases of the nitride layer, in the recorded XRD\nspectra the peaks from Me6C carbides are visible. These peaks\noccur in the x-ray diffraction patterns of non-nitrided M2 steel.\nIn alloy steels various types of carbides are formed depending\non the contents of strong carbide forming elements. In the\ninvestigated M2 (HS6-5-2) steel carbides of MC, M\n2C, and\nM6C type occur in the form of: (Fe 0,06W0,1Mo0,15V0,65-\nCr0,07)C0,89, (Fe0,27W0,44Mo0,55V0,43Cr0,29)C, and (Fe2,52W0,76-\nMo0,79V0,26Cr0,29)C, respectively (Ref19). The thickness of the\ndiffusion zone in the layers ranged from 50.7lm (process 1) to\n102.5 lm (process 8), while the compound zone thickness\nvaried from 0 (processes 1 and 4) to 5.9lm (process 3). As it is\nseen from Fig.3(b) the thickness of the compound zone does\nnot correlate with the thickness of the diffusion zone—the\nthickest compound zone of 5.9lm was obtained in the layer\nwith the diffusion zone 87.7lm thick, while in the layer with\nthe thickest diffusion zone (102.5lm) the compound zone of\nthe thickness of only 2.6lm was obtained. This observation\ncan be explained based on the ANOVA analysis, which shows\nthat the nitride layer thickness is determined ﬁrst of all by the\nsubstrate temperature, while the thickness of the compound\nlayer depends mainly on the composition of the gaseous\natmosphere (Fig. 4a, b). Also the mechanical properties of the\nTable 4 The parameters optimized in the second experimental series and their value levels applied in the experiments\nParameter\nvalue level\nParameter\nNitriding phase\nduration, h Atmosphere composition, %\nAtmosphere\npressure, hPa\nLevel 1 4 20% N 2/30% H2/50% Ar 2\nLevel 2 5.5 25% N 2/25% H2/50% Ar 3.5\nTable 5 Plan of experiments of the second series prepared according to the Taguchi/C213s orthogonal table L4 (23)\nProcess\nnumber\nParameter values\nNitriding phase\nduration, h Atmosphere composition, %\nAtmosphere\npressure, hPa\nProcess 1 4 20% N 2/30% H2/50% Ar 2\nProcess 2 4 25% N 2/25% H2/50% Ar 3.5\nProcess 3 5.5 20% N 2/30% H2/50% Ar 3.5\nProcess 4 5.5 25% N 2/25% H2/50% Ar 2\nTable 3 Plan of experiments of the ﬁrst series prepared according to the Taguchi/C213s orthogonal table L9 (34)\nProcess\nnumber\nParameter values\nNitriding phase\nduration, h Atmosphere composition, %\nBIAS\nvoltage, V\nSubstrate\ntemperature, /C176C\nProcess 1 4 25% N 2/50% H2/25% Ar /C0 100 500\nProcess 2 4 50% N 2/50% H2/0% Ar /C0 150 525\nProcess 3 4 75% N 2/25% H2/0% Ar /C0 200 550\nProcess 4 5 25% N 2/50% H2/25% Ar /C0 150 550\nProcess 5 5 50% N 2/50% H2/0% Ar /C0 200 500\nProcess 6 5 75% N 2/25% H2/0% Ar /C0 100 525\nProcess 7 6 25% N 2/50% H2/25% Ar /C0 200 525\nProcess 8 6 50% N 2/50% H2/0% Ar /C0 100 550\nProcess 9 6 75% N 2/25% H2/0% Ar /C0 150 500\nJournal of Materials Engineering and Performance Volume 22(2) February 2013—413\nobtained layers, i.e., surface hardness, maximum microhard-\nness, microhardness proﬁles, and the values of the fracture\ntoughness coefﬁcient (KIc) are highly diversiﬁed (Fig.3c, d).\nThe maximum microhardness does not follow exactly the\nchanges of the surface hardness, because the ﬁrst one depends\nmainly on the thickness of thec¢-Fe\n4N compound layer, while\nthe second one depends on thea-Fe(N) solution zone thickness.\nThe comparison of the fracture toughness coefﬁcient values\nwith the thickness and the hardness of the layers (Fig. 3d)\nindicate a correlation existing betweenKIc values and the total\nthickness of the layers. The highest value ofKIc was obtained\nfor the nitrided layer with the lowest thickness of 50.7lm. This\nobservation is consistent with that formulated in (Ref20) that a\ndecrease in the wear resistance of high speed tool steels could\noccur with nitrided depths higher than 50lm due to increasing\nembrittlement. Moreover the occurrence of such a correlation in\nthe layers nitrided using ASPN technology indicate that the\nincrease in brittleness with increasing thickness of the layers is\nnot caused by the edge effect, which does not occur in this\nnitriding method. The increase in brittleness should be rather\nascribed to the stress level in thicker layers. Although the\nhighest value ofK\nIc was shown by the layer of bright nitriding,\nit would be difﬁcult to indicate the correlation between the\nfracture toughness coefﬁcient and the thickness of the com-\npound layer—layers obtained in the processes 4 and 5 contradict\nthe existence of such correlation. And similarly, hardly one can\nshow the correlation betweenK\nIc and the surface hardness or\nmaximum hardness of the layers.\nThe inﬂuence of the individual process parameters on the\ntotal thickness, the compound zone thickness, and the fracture\ntoughness of created nitrided layers were determined by the\nTaguchi approach using computer programme STATISTICA\n(StatSoft\n/C210 ) and is shown in Fig.4. The aim of the ﬁrst series of\nexperiments was to achieve the nitrided layer without the\ncompound zone, with maximum thickness, and with maximum\nfracture toughness. Accordingly, the criterion /C212the larger-\nthe-better/C213was applied to evaluate the inﬂuence of process\nparameters on the layer thickness and its fracture toughness,\nwhile the dependence of the compound zone thickness on the\nnitriding conditions was estimated using the criterion /C212the\nsmaller-the-better/C213. As it follows from the diagram in Fig.4(a),\nin order to obtain maximum thickness of the nitrided layer the\nASPN process should be performed at following process\nparameter values: duration of 4 h (level 3), atmosphere\ncontaining 75% N\n2 and 25% H2 (level 3), substrate BIAS of\n/C0 150 V (level 2), and the substrate temperature of 550/C176 C\n(level 3). Moreover, the analysis showed insigniﬁcant effect of\nthe substrate BIAS on the layer thickness. The diagram shown\nin Fig.4(b) indicates that the thickness of the compound layer\nis determined ﬁrst of all by the composition of the gaseous\natmosphere. The lowest thickness of the compound layer can be\nobtained in the process carried out for 5 h (level 2 of the\nprocess duration), in the atmosphere containing 25% N\n2, 50%\nH2, and 25% Ar (level 1), at the substrate BIAS of/C0 100 V\n(level 1) and at the substrate temperature of 500/C176 C (level 1).\nThe same set of the value levels of the atmosphere composition,\nthe substrate BIAS, and the substrate temperature lead to the\nmaximalization of the fracture toughness of the created nitrided\nlayer (Fig.4c). Process duration has negligible inﬂuence on the\nlayer fracture toughness.\nThe presented results of the ﬁrst series of experiments\nallowed to deﬁne the ASPN process parameters that determine\nanalyzed properties of the nitrided layer, i.e., its total thickness,\ncompound zone thickness, and the fracture toughness of the\nlayer. They also show that in order to reach the planned aim of\nthe experiments, i.e., to achieve the nitrided layer without the\ncompound zone, with maximum thickness and with maximum\nfracture toughness, the compromise combination of ASPN\nprocess parameters must be selected from among those\nindicated by the Taguchi procedure as optimal for individual\nproperties of the layers. Before selection of such an optimal set\nof process parameter values the second series of experiments\nwas performed in order to get additional information on the\nvariation of the nitrided layer properties at lower nitrogen\ncontent and higher pressure of the process atmosphere.\nFig. 2 Nitrided layer created on the planing knife: (a) cross-section\nof the planing knife after nitriding, (b) cross-section of the nitrided\nplaning knife after sharpening, (c) microsection of the nitrided layer\nafter measurement of the microhardness distribution\n414—Volume 22(2) February 2013 Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance\n3.2 Results of the Second Series of Experiments Executed\nAccording to Taguchi /C213s Orthogonal Table L4 (2 3)\nThe properties of the nitrided layers created within the\nsecond series of experiments are presented in Table 6. All\ncreated layers were bright nitriding layers, i.e., did not contain\nthe compound zone of iron nitrides, but their thickness and\nmechanical properties differed signiﬁcantly. Wide ranges of the\nvalues of the obtained layers properties, selected as the measures\nof the layers quality in the second series of experiments, i.e.,\nthe total layer thickness (11.0-48.3 lm), surface hardness\n(832-996 HV10) and the fracture toughness coefﬁcient\n(15.50-38.78 MN/m\n3/2), indicate that the ASPN process is very\nsensitive to analyzed parameters, particularly to the pressure of\ngaseous atmosphere. The results of the analysis performed with\nthe Taguchi procedure using computer programme STATISTICA\nare shown in Fig.5. From the presented diagrams it follows that\nin the conditions of the experiments executed within the second\nseries the fracture toughness of the nitrided layer, which is\ncritical for the performance of the planing knives because of\ntheir speciﬁc geometry, is almost completely determined by one\nprocess parameter—atmosphere pressure (Fig. 5c). At low\nprocess pressure (2 hPa) the fracture toughness of the layer\ndrops dramatically. This result conﬁrms the observation formu-\nlated in (Ref 21) about higher fracture of the nitrided layers\ncreated in low pressure (2 hPa) DCPN processes and means that\nthis tendency occurs also in ASPN despite the lack of energetic\nion bombardment of the nitrided substrates in this technology.\nOn the other hand, at higher pressure of the ASPN process the\nthickness and surface hardness of the nitrided layer drop\nsigniﬁcantly (Fig. 5a, b). It means that in the ASPN processes\noptimized for planing knives, higher pressure should be applied\nin order to achieve high fracture toughness of the tools. The\nthickness and surface hardness of the nitrided layer should be\nimproved by increasing process duration rather, which has\npositive inﬂuence on the layer thickness and hardness without\nsigniﬁcant detrimental effect on the phase structure, than by\nincreasing nitrogen content in the gaseous atmosphere, which\nleads to the formation of the compound zone of iron nitrides\n(Fig. 4b).\n3.3 Final Adjustment of the ASPN Process Parameters\nfor Planing Knives Made from High Speed Steel\nThe aim of the ﬁnal stage of process optimization was to\nadjust the technological parameters of ASPN process so as to\nachieve the main goal of the research, i.e., to create on the\nsurfaces of the planing knives made of HSS the nitrided layers\nof high fracture toughness and maximum possible thickness\nand hardness, which would pass the standard industrial\noperation of sharpening and could be subjected to the ﬁeld\ntest on highly effective planing machine.\nFig. 3 The properties of the nitrided layers created in the processes performed within the ﬁrst series of experiments: (a) phase composition,\n(b) structure of the layers, (c) microhardness proﬁles, (d) hardness and fracture toughness\nJournal of Materials Engineering and Performance Volume 22(2) February 2013—415\nBased on the results of two series of experiments, which\nwere planned, executed and elaborated using the Taguchi\napproach, a ﬁnal series of six experiments was planned for ﬁnal\nveriﬁcation. In the ﬁnal series of processes the substrate BIAS\nvoltage, the substrate temperature and atmosphere total ﬂow\nwere kept at the levels set for the second series of experiments,\ni.e., BIAS = /C0 100 V ,T = 500 /C176 C, Q\nR = 1400 mL/min. The\nprocess duration, as well as composition and pressure of the\ngaseous atmosphere were used as variable parameters for\nprecise tuning of the nitrided layers properties (Table7). These\nparameters varied only slightly around the values indicated as a\nresult of analysis done using the Taguchi procedure.\nThe values of the fracture toughness coefﬁcient and the\nmain properties of the nitrided layers created in the ﬁnal series\nof experiments are presented in Fig.6. Despite narrow intervals\nof variation of the process parameters, the properties of the\nnitrided layers produced in individual processes differ signif-\nicantly. The thickness and the fracture toughness coefﬁcient are\nin the ranges of 25.0-42.5 lm and 17.82-28.78 MN/m\n3/2,\nrespectively. The presented results conﬁrm the trends, indicated\nas a result of the analysis made using the Taguchi approach,\nthat the atmosphere pressure is the most important parameter of\nthe ASPN process in adjusting the fracture toughness of the\nlayers. Even as small as 0.2 hPa, variation of the pressure is\nsigniﬁcant for the fracture toughness coefﬁcient. Its value is\nhigher in the layers created at the atmosphere pressure of\n2.5 hPa in comparison with these nitrided at 2.3 hPa, even for\nthe layers similar in thickness and hardness, e.g., obtained in\nthe processes V2 and V6. The layers obtained in these two\nprocesses conﬁrm also the above mentioned indication, that\nFig. 4 The inﬂuence of the individual process parameters used in the ﬁrst series of experiments on the properties of nitrided layers: (a) the\neffect of each parameter on total thickness of the layer, (b) the effect of each parameter on the compound layer thickness, (c) the effect of each\nparameter on the fracture toughness coefﬁcient\nTable 6 The properties of the nitrided layers created within the second series of experiments\nProcess\nnumber\nLayer\nthickness, lm\nSurface\nhardness HV10\nMaximum hardness\nHV0.05max\nFracture toughness\n(KIc), MN/m3/2\nProcess 1 31.0 888 1185 18.33\nProcess 2 11.0 832 941 38.78\nProcess 3 16.4 849 992 38.72\nProcess 4 48.3 996 1318 16.50\n416—Volume 22(2) February 2013 Journal of Materials Engineering and Performance\nwhen increasing the pressure, to compensate the layer thickness\ndrop, instead of increasing the nitrogen content it is better to\nenlarge duration of the process.\n3.4 Veriﬁcation of the Created Nitrided Layers\nin the Sharpening Operation\nThe planing knives nitrided in the processes V1-V6 were\ninstalled in the 8 knife hydro head (Fig.7) and subjected to the\ntest of sharpening performed according to standard industrial\nprocedure applied for such types of woodworking tools. In the\ntwo remaining seats of the head the standard, non-nitrided\nknives were installed for comparison. As a measure of the\nnitrided knives quality the spalling depth of the cutting edge\nwas applied. The results of the sharpening test are presented in\nTable 8 and Fig.8. The cutting edge of non-nitrided knife after\nsharpening is shown in Fig. 8(a). The susceptibility of the\nnitrided knives /C213cutting edges to spalling shown in the\nsharpening test correlate with the measured values of fracture\ntoughness coefﬁcient. The deepest cavities, up to 25lm, were\nidentiﬁed on cutting edges of the knives nitrided in the\nprocesses V2 and V3 carried out at the pressure of 2.3 hPa\nFig. 5 The inﬂuence of the individual process parameters used in the second series of experiments on the properties of nitrided layers:\n(a) the effect of each parameter on total thickness of the layer, (b) the effect of each parameter on surface hardness of the layer, (c) the effect of\neach parameter on the fracture toughness coefﬁcient\nTable 7 The parameters of the veriﬁcation processes\nProcess number\nParameter values\nNitriding phase\nduration, h Atmosphere composition, %\nAtmosphere\npressure, hPa\nProcess V1 6 25% N 2/25% H2/50% Ar 2.5\nProcess V2 6.5 25% N 2/25% H2/50% Ar 2.3\nProcess V3 7 25% N 2/25% H2/50% Ar 2.3\nProcess V4 6 20% N 2/30% H2/50% Ar 2.5\nProcess V5 6.5 20% N 2/30% H2/50% Ar 2.5\nProcess V6 7 20% N 2/30% H2/50% Ar 2.5\nJournal of Materials Engineering and Performance Volume 22(2) February 2013—417\n(Fig. 8c), i.e., these which also showed the lowest values of the\nfracture toughness coefﬁcient.

Conclusions\nThe studies described in the article related to the develop-\nment of the technological parameters of the ASPN process in\nthe prototype, the newly built device and their optimization for\nnitriding planing knives for woodworking made of HSS AISI\nM2. The main challenge in the carried out research was to\ndevelop, in the possible shortest time, the industrial technology\nfor nitriding the tools used in woodworking production in the\nnewly constructed device, which characteristics were com-\npletely unknown. To speed up the process of the technology\ndevelopment the Taguchi approach of planning experiments\nwas used, moreover from the very beginning of the research the\nnitriding processes and investigations of the nitrided layers\nproperties were carried out using real tools as the substrates.\nAlso the veriﬁcation of the suitability of the obtained nitrided\nlayers on planing knives for woodworking was done in the\nsharpening operation performed in industrial conditions accord-\ning to standard sharpening procedure. The results of the\npresented research indicate that:\n1. The Taguchi method of design of experiments proved to\nbe very effective for processing the experimental results\nand optimization the technological parameters of the\nASPN process. Thanks to the Taguchi approach it was\nenough to carry out two series of experiments containing\nthirteen experiments in total to determine individual inﬂu-\nence of each investigated process parameter on the proper-\nties of created nitrided layers. Without using the Taguchi\nscheme as much as 89 (3\n4 +2 3) experiments would have\nbeen necessary to get such a set of information.\n2. The results of the carried out research conﬁrmed suitabil-\nity of the ASPN technology for nitriding cutting tools\nmade of HSS with extremely sharp wedge angles, like\nwoodworking planing tools.\n3. The critical parameter of the nitrided woodworking plan-\ning knives is the fracture toughness of their cutting\nedges. The carried out research proved that the values of\nfracture toughness coefﬁcient K\nIc are in correlation with\nmaximum spalling depths of the cutting edge measured\nafter sharpening, and therefore may be used as a measure\nof the nitrided planing knives quality.\n4. The main technological indications for nitriding HSS\nplaning knives are:\n– the total thickness of the nitrided layer is determined\nmainly by the substrate temperature and the pressure of the\ngaseous atmosphere, process duration and atmosphere com-\nposition have moderate effect, while the effect of the sub-\nstrate BIAS is insigniﬁcant;\n– the thickness of the compound layer is determined ﬁrst of\nall by the composition of the gaseous atmosphere;\n– the fracture toughness of the nitrided layer, which is critical\nfor the performance of the planing knives, is almost com-\npletely determined by one process parameter—atmosphere\npressure;\n– in the ASPN processes optimized for planing knives, high-\ner pressure and low nitrogen content should be applied in\norder to achieve high fracture toughness of the tools,\nwhereas the thickness and surface hardness of the nitrided\nlayer should be improved by increasing process duration.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors wish to thank the Directors of FABA S.A.\nBaboszewo for providing the tools for the research.
