  "abstract": "Background The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into healthcare sector has fundamentally transformed patient care paradigms, particularly through the creation of patient education materials (PEMs) tailored to individual needs. This Study aims to assess the precision and readability AI-generated information on kidney cancer using ChatGPT 4.0, Gemini AI, and Perplexity AI., comparing these outputs to PEMs provided by the American Urological Association (AUA) and the European Association of Urology (EAU). The objective is to guide physicians in directing patients to accurate and understandable resources. Methods PEMs published by AUA and EAU were collected and categorized. kidney cancer-related queries, identified via Google Trends (GT), were input into CahtGPT-4.0, Gemini AI, and Perplexity AI. Four independent reviewers assessed the AI outputs for accuracy grounded on five distinct categories, employing a 5-point Likert scale. A readability evaluation was conducted utilizing established formulas, including Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Formula (FKGL). AI chatbots were then tasked with simplifying their outputs to achieve a sixth-grade reading level. Results The PEM published by the AUA was the most readable with a mean readability score of 9.84 ± 1.2, in contrast to EAU (11.88 ± 1.11), ChatGPT-4.0 (11.03 ± 1.76), Perplexity AI (12.66 ± 1.83), and Gemini AI (10.83 ± 2.31). The Chatbots demonstrated the capability to simplify text lower grade levels upon request, with ChatGPT-4.0 achieving a readability grade level ranging from 5.76 to 9.19, Perplexity AI from 7.33 to 8.45, Gemini AI from 6.43 to 8.43. While official PEMS were considered accurate, the LLMs generated outputs exhibited an overall high level of accuracy with minor detail omission and some information inaccuracies. Information related to kidney cancer treatment was found to be the least accurate among the evaluated categories. Conclusion Although the PEM published by AUA being the most readable, both authoritative PEMs and Large Language Models (LLMs) generated outputs exceeded the recommended readability threshold for general population. AI Chatbots can simplify their outputs when explicitly instructed. However, notwithstanding their accuracy, LLMs-generated outputs are susceptible to detail omission and inaccuracies. The variability in AI performance necessitates cautious use as an adjunctive tool in patient education.",
