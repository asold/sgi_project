I NTRODUCTION\nA\nS AN advanced manufacturing pattern, smart manufac-\nturing has received high regard in many countries, which\nhave proposed corresponding development strategies accord-\ning to their national conditions, such as Industry 4.0 [ 1], Made\nin China 2025 [2], and Industrial Internet [3]. With the contin-\nuous development of social networks and informationization,\nthe engineering systems are also evolving with the integration\nof human society and physical industry, which is far beyond\nthe ability of cyber–physical systems (CPSs) and the Internet\nof Things (IoT) to deal with [4], [5], and [6]. Therefore, cyber–\nphysical–social systems (CPSSs) and the Internet of Minds\n(IoM) have become new infrastructures of smart manufac-\nturing [ 7], [ 8], where knowledge automation (KA) exerts a\nvital role in the exploration of their applications, whereby\nIndustry 5.0 will become a reality [ 9], [10].\nTo achieve smart manufacturing, there are several challenges\nto overcome for the current manufacturing pattern. First, in\nCPSS, human, and social behaviors with the characteristics of\nuncertainty, diversity, and complexity exacerbate cognitive or\nmodeling gaps between actual systems and their models [ 11];\nsecond, long-delayed responses to market changes and fail-\nure to properly comprehend customer requirements result in\nless competitive products and inventory accumulation; ﬁnally,\nthe operations of some equipment rely on human engineers’\ndemonstrations and even quite a few manual interventions\nare required in automated production processes, which is nei-\nther ﬂexible nor efﬁcient [ 12]. Most of the existing works on\nsmart manufacturing are still limited to the theoretical level,\nand some small manufacturing issues are solved. But speciﬁc\nmethods for systematic applications are deﬁcient and need to\nbe explored [ 13], [14], [15], [16].\nIn this article, the artiﬁcial systems, computational exper-\niments, and parallel execution (ACP) method is applied for\nsolving manufacturing issues to develop a new manufacturing\nframework and explores its systematic application for produc-\ning shoes. Therefore, the main contributions of this article are\nhighlighted as follows.\n1) Based on the ACP method, DeFACT is introduced as a\nframework for parallel manufacturing in ManuVerse to\ntake full advantage of collective wisdom and real-virtual\ninteractions for achieving the rapid transformation from\ndemands to products, contributing to strongly competi-\ntive products and low inventory.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Section II introduces\nrelated works about CPS, CPSS, Metaverse, and ManuVerse\nas well as smart manufacturing. The DeFACT framework for\nparallel manufacturing, including parallel workers and manu-\nfacturing foundation models (MF) is elaborated in Section III\nand then a DeFACT-based case is studied from three aspects:\nworkﬂow and production line named FlexVega, collaborations\nbetween parallel workers, and challenges and solutions for\nﬂexible manufacturing, in Section IV. Finally, we conclude\nthis article in Section V.\nII. R\nELATED WORKS\nIn this section, we introduce the concepts of CPS, CPSS,\nmetaverses, and ManuVerse as well as the relationships\nbetween them at ﬁrst. Then, we give a brief description of\nresearch works about smart manufacturing from CPS-based\nand CPSS-based aspects and analyze the existing issues.\nA. CPS, CPSS, Metaverse, and ManuVerse\nThe term CPS was created by National Science Foundation\n(NSF) in the United States around 2006 [ 17], which describes\nmultidimensional complex systems occupying cyber and phys-\nical dimension, and is marked by a tight integration between\ncomputation, communication, and control in their operations\nand interactions with their surroundings [ 18]. The continuous\nimprovement in networked levels enables humans to become\nthe most agile social sensors and be pulled into an information\necosystem that combines cyberspace and physicspace [ 19],\nwhich conversely exert a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on human think-\ning and behaviors. As a result, CPS is no longer suitable for\nhuman-in-the-loop manufacturing systems.\nFor exhaustive consideration of human and social factors\nin complex systems, the concept of CPSS was introduced\nin the late 1990s [ 7], which is based on Karl Popper’s the-\nory of reality that states our universe is composed of the\nphysical, mental, and artiﬁcial world, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nThe development stage of the concept of IT has been under-\ngoing from “Old IT (Industrial Technology)” to “Past IT\n(Information Technology),” and then to “New IT (Intelligent\nTechnology),” tackling the resource disparity, the information\ndisparity and the intellectual disparity, respectively [ 11]. In\nCPSS, three types of IT coexist, whereby cyber systems, phys-\nical systems, and social systems interact and entangle with\neach other, contributing to unifying the contradiction between\nFig. 1. CPSS based on popper’s three worlds.\nemergence and convergence. CPSS is taken as the infrastruc-\nture of smart manufacturing in the next stage of Industry 4.0,\nnamely, Industry 5.0, which will elevate AI to hybrid intel-\nligence (HI) [ 11]. Based on CPSS, complex manufacturing\nsystems can be managed and controlled more efﬁciently to\nbetter coordinate and integrate assorted resources, such as\nphysics, computing, and society.\nThe concept of metaverse, which is becoming a hot trendy\nconcept all over the world, is explained by Matthew Ball\nas “a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-\ntime rendered three-dimensional (3-D) virtual worlds,” which\nany number of users can “synchronously and persistently”\nenter by using “continuity of data,” such as “identity, his-\ntory, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments” for\nimmersive experience [ 20]. As stated in [ 21] and [ 22], the\nmetaverse is essentially equivalent to CPSS and both are only\ndifferent names. The use of metaverses in the manufacturing\nﬁeld can form a new manufacturing ecology involving econ-\nomy, trust, and immersive experience, named as ManuVerse,\nthrough a series of ITs, such as digital twins, social comput-\ning, blockchain, and DAO [ 10], [ 23], [ 24], [ 25], [ 26], [ 27].\nIn ManuVerse, humans, machines, and objects are seamlessly\nconnected and incorporated into the physical industry, and they\nhave their own avatars that live and run in parallel.\nB. Smart Manufacturing\nSmart manufacturing is the application of advanced intel-\nligent technologies in manufacturing industry, where engi-\nneers’ skills and experts’ knowledge are modeled through the\nintegration of knowledge engineering, machine control, soft-\nware systems, and artiﬁcial intelligence to enable intelligent\nrobots perform customized production without human inter-\nvention [1], [28], [29]. The main target of smart manufacturing\nis to achieve a new production way of various properties, such\nas self-perception, self-learning, self-decision, self-execution,\nand self-adaptation. As time passed by, smart manufacturing\nhas experienced two stages: 1) CPS-based manufacturing and\n2) CPSS-based manufacturing.\nCPS-based manufacturing has developed some typical rep-\nresentatives from different perspectives [ 30], [31], [32], [33],\n[34], [35], [36]. wireless manufacturing (WM), and ubiquitous\nmanufacturing (UbiM) are dedicated to the effective collection\nand processing of real-time data in manufacturing and are uti-\nlized to construct advanced functionality and infrastructures\n2190 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS: SYSTEMS, VOL. 53, NO. 4, APRIL 2023\nfor operations of physical devices in CPS [ 30], [ 31], [ 32].\nDifferent from them, service-oriented manufacturing (SOM)\nfocuses on the cyber dimension of CPS-based manufactur-\ning, aiming at managing the service composition and business\nprocesses [ 15], including industrial product-service systems\n(IPSS) [33] and cloud manufacturing [34], [35]. As SoM mod-\nels, IPSS integrates products and services into a system for\nthe servitization of enterprises so as to put the company at\nan advantage in completion with others [ 33], whereas cloud\nmanufacturing pays more attention to the improvement on\nuser experience by delivering ﬂexible and on-demand man-\nufacturing services [ 34], [ 35]. Recently, digital twin-based\nmanufacturing (DTM) has attracted extensive attention. DTM\ndigitalizes physical production resources as their digital coun-\nterparts and contributes to making full use of production data\nthrough interactions between physical and virtual systems for\neffective control and real-time optimization of manufactur-\ning [ 36]. Obviously, CPS-based manufacturing ignores the\nimportant impact of human and social factors on the actual\nmanufacturing process, although it is capable of achieving\npassable conjoining and interactions between cyberspace and\nphysicspace.\nSince the emergence of CPSS, which further enhances\nthe fusion of cyberspace and physicspace and incorpo-\nrates the complexity of human and social factors into\nconsideration, research on CPSS-based manufacturing has\nbeen carried out [ 13], [ 14], [ 15], [ 16]. new generation\nAI-driven intelligent manufacturing (NGAIIM) integrates\nhuman/machine/environment/information into product lifecy-\ncle activities with an emphasis on the introduction of new\ngeneration AI for realizing manufacturing intelligence [ 13].\nWisdom manufacturing is a manufacturing paradigm of\nhumans–computers–things collaboration with the integration\nof IoT, Internet of Services (IoS), Internet of Knowledge (IoK),\nand Internet of People (IoP), which combines and extends the\nconcepts of cloud manufacturing, semantic network manufac-\nturing, enterprise 2.0, and IoT manufacturing [ 15]. Inspired by\na 5C level structure of CPS [37], a data-centric 7C level frame-\nwork of CPSS serves to handle heterogeneous data along the\ndata-information-knowledge-wisdom pyramid for the support\nof social manufacturing [16]. As we can see, the existing work\nfor CPSS-based manufacturing is still conﬁned to the frame-\nworks and structures for the organization of resources and few\nspeciﬁc methods are provided to deal with the complexity and\nunpredictability of human-in-the-loop manufacturing systems.\nParallel manufacturing, as an important milestone of smart\nmanufacturing, is based on the ACP method, providing a\nfeasible solution to make human-in-the-loop manufacturing\nsystems computable, testable, and veriﬁable. It constructs par-\nallel production systems to achieve real-virtual interactions and\ninteractive optimization for the management and control of\ncomplex systems during the manufacturing process [ 38], [39],\n[40], [41]. To further develop more intelligent parallel manu-\nfacturing, in this article, DeFACT is introduced as a framework\nfor parallel manufacturing in ManuVerse, where the coopera-\ntion of parallel workers and a manufacturing foundation model\nnamed MF-PC to aid in the development of digital workers\nare elaborated.\nIII. D\nEFACT FOR PARALLEL MANUFACTURING\nIn this section, the framework of DeFACT for parallel man-\nufacturing is introduced and then the DAO-based interactions\nbetween parallel workers consisting of robotic workers, digital\nworkers, and human workers are elaborated to transform from\nprofessional division to real-virtual division. Finally, as the\ncornerstone of digital workers, MF-PC is proposed to further\nintensify their perceptual and cognitive intelligence, achieving\nindustrial development for fragmented applications.\nA. DeFACT Framework: Management and Control\nThe framework of DeFACT in ManuVerse is illustrated in\nFig. 2 for the management and control of parallel manufac-\nturing, which aims at upgrading six indexes of manufactur-\ning systems, i.e., safety index, security index, sustainability\nindex, sensitivity index, service index, and smartness index,\nto realize six kinds of intelligence, i.e., cognitive intelli-\ngence, parallel intelligence, encrypted intelligence, federated\nintelligence, social intelligence, and ecological intelligence,\nthrough advanced intelligent technology, such as ACP [ 21],\nKA [10], blockchain [ 9], smart contracts [ 26], cognitive com-\nputing [ 42], scenarios engineering (SE) [ 43], and foundation\nmodels [44].\nIn DeFACT, social intelligence is collected, integrated, and\nanalyzed into social demands for rapid response to market\nand policy changes, thus leading to zero inventory produc-\ntion. Collective wisdom is gathered and taken full advantage\nof to create products through crowdsourcing [ 45] via com-\nputers and mobile phones, which breaks the limitation of\nindividual capacities and the communication barriers. Inspired\nby circular causality [ 46], based on ACP, parallel evolu-\ntion, closed-loop feedback, and collaborative optimization for\na series of manufacturing operations are achieved through\nreal-virtual interactions between actual systems and artiﬁ-\ncial systems in factories. Digital workers and robotic workers\nundertake almost all the work, accounting for 80% and 15%,\nrespectively, while human workers concentrate on the more\ncomplex and creative rest, with a proportion of 5%. The\nparadigm is more ﬂexible and robust against disturbances,\nwhereby human workers can pay more attention to extremely\ncomplex and creative tasks.\nA manufacturing system is regarded as a typical CPSS\naccording to DeFACT, which consists of physical systems\nfor totally integrated automation, cyber systems for product\nlife-cycle management, and social systems for manufacturing\nintelligence. Physical systems are collections of production\nelements that exist objectively, including human workers,\nequipment, robotic workers, materials, sensors, semi-ﬁnished\nproducts, etc. Compared to traditional manufacturing systems,\nthose systems have the ability to perceive, access and inte-\ngrate heterogeneous real-time data from sensors supported\nby different protocols, that is, the heterogeneous network\nand data fusion technology play a vital role [ 47], [48], [49].\nCyber systems are used for the operation and management\nof physical systems and social systems, including com-\nputer hardware, communication equipment, computer soft-\nware, information resources, etc., where the utilization of\nY ANG et al.: DeFACT IN ManuVerse FOR PARALLEL MANUFACTURING 2191\nFig. 2. Framework of DeFACT for parallel manufacturing in ManuVerse: parallel manufacturing management and control.\ncloud/fog/edge computing for high computational efﬁciency\nrequires the data security and privacy protection technology\nto avoid causing ﬁnancial loss or reputational damage for\nhumans and enterprises [ 50], [51]. Humans in social systems\nare incorporated into the manufacturing system, acting as dif-\nferent roles, such as human–machine symbiosis, humans as\noperators of complex systems, humans as agents in multiagent\nsystems, and the human as a part of a controlled system,\nthrough the human–computer interaction technology, such as\nvirtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality\n(MR) [52], [53], [54].\nIn terms of ACP, DeFACT constructs one or many artiﬁcial\nsystems as software-deﬁned social laboratories for compu-\ntational experiments, namely, descriptive intelligence, which\nare not direct, mechanical, passive, and mirror reﬂections of,\nand thus not completely consistent with the actual manu-\nfacturing system [ 22]. Those systems are treated as some\nalternative realities of different evolutionary directions [ 55],\nwhere a variety of manufacturing behaviors and phenomena,\nespecially those involving human and social factors, are repro-\nduced and analyzed to acquire their occurrence reasons and\ndifferent related solutions are tested and evaluated for choos-\ning the optimal, whereby predictive intelligence is generated.\nOnce chosen, the optimal solution is straightforwardly applied\nfor the actual system. It is worth nothing that the solution\nis not static but dynamically optimized during parallel exe-\ncution through real-virtual interactions between the actual\nsystem and its artiﬁcial counterparts for prescriptive intelli-\ngence. This contributes to adaptation to unanticipated external\nchanges in a timely manner. In addition, during computational\nexperiments, to handle prevalent problems in industrial scenar-\nios, i.e., insufﬁcient and unbalanced data, some methods are\nused to built and generate virtual data based on real data for\ndata augmentation, such as SE [ 43], variational autoencoder\n(V AE) [56], generative adversarial network (GAN) [ 57], and\ndiffusion model (DM) [ 58].\nBesides, DeFACT conjoins the actual system with its arti-\nﬁcial counterparts in three modes for different intentions, i.e.,\nlearning and training, experimentation and evaluation, and\ncontrol and management [ 59]. In the learning and training\nmode, artiﬁcial systems are treated as a center of learning\nand training operational procedures for parallel workers. In\nthe experimentation and evaluation mode, artiﬁcial systems\nare used as social laboratories combining computers and\ncyberspace, where “small data” is transformed into “big data”\nand then “deep intelligence” is extracted and condensed. By\nthis means, different solutions can be tested and evaluated\nquickly and efﬁciently. In the control and management mode,\nbased on generalized circular causality and circular logic, his-\ntorical data, current scenarios and future visions form a closed\n2192 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS: SYSTEMS, VOL. 53, NO. 4, APRIL 2023\nFig. 3. DAO-based organization and interaction mode between robotic workers, digital workers, and human workers in smart factories.\nloop that leads the actual system to approach the desired states\nportrayed by artiﬁcial systems.\nB. Parallel Workers: From Professional Division to\nReal-Virtual Division\nIn DeFACT, there are three types of workers named parallel\nworkers: 1) human workers with intuitive rationality; 2) digital\nworkers with computational rationality; and 3) robotic workers\nwith adaptive rationality, in collaboration with each other for\naccomplishing production, which brings about transforming\ntraditional professional division into real-virtual division [ 46].\nRobotic workers are intelligent machines that dominate physi-\ncal work, digital workers are comprised of intelligent programs\nand information machines, with the same appearances as\nhumans, which are equivalent to the “brain” of humans for\nmental work; whereas human workers mainly concentrate\non more difﬁcult and creative tasks beyond the capabilities\nof the former two, such as the maintenance and upgrades\nof equipment and the correction of failed results, in liber-\nation from tedious noncreative labor. This mode contributes\nto sufﬁciently leveraging intellectual resources. Additionally,\nnonhuman workers can run efﬁciently and continuously with-\nout salaries, resulting in increased productivity and reduced\ncosts.\nFig. 3 illustrates the DAO-based organization and\ninteraction mode between parallel workers. Digital workers\nacting as the core of interactions are organized into a DAO\nwhere information is communicated and exchanged. A DAO\nis a ﬂexible and open organization without central authority or\nmanagement hierarchy, of which all operational rules depend\non collective decisions and are encoded on tamper-resistant\nblockchains [ 25]. Robotic workers are execution units for\nphysical tasks according to control commands mostly from\ndigital workers. Due to enjoying the top priority, human\nworkers have the ability to enforce the direct command\nof robotic workers and the modiﬁcation of knowledge and\ndecisions of digital workers via human–machine interfaces\n(HMIs). The correspondence between parallel workers and\ntasks can be not only one-to-one but also one-to-many as\nwell as many-to-many, which is dependent on the required\ncomputational or operational capabilities and the complexity\nof tasks. Once digital workers become available, they will\ncompute and rank the remaining tasks and list the related\nrequirements for accomplishing them, such as time and\nresources, especially idle robotic workers. Based on those\nranking and requirements, every digital worker can draft and\nlaunch proposals for the allocation of missions and resources.\nAfter considerable discussions about the proposals in the\norganization, every member must make decisions: agreement\nor disagreement. If the proposals meet with the approval of\nthe majority, they will be recorded by smart contracts and\nexecuted by everyone.\nClearly, digital workers exert a critical part in DeFACT-\nbased production and their intelligence is divided into two\naspects: 1) cognitive intelligence and 2) perceptual intelli-\ngence. For perceptual intelligence, digital workers should have\nsimilar perceptual abilities to humans, such as vision, hearing,\nand touch, [ 60] and can interact with external surroundings\nthrough machine learning technologies, such as natural lan-\nguage processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and speech\nrecognition (SV) [ 61], [ 62], [ 63]. For cognitive intelligence,\ndigital workers should be capable of reasoning analogous with\nhuman brains by using methods of psychology, biology, sig-\nnal processing, information theory, physics, mathematics, and\nstatistics, called as cognitive computing [ 64]. Cognitive com-\nputing is a core technical ﬁeld of cognitive science, with the\nproperties of assistance, understanding, decision, and discov-\nery, which studies humans’ cognitive behaviors and integrate\nthem with intelligent algorithms to solve highly complex prob-\nlems [64], [65]. Currently, robotic process automation (RPA)\nis widely used to perform duplicate work in computers accord-\ning to human demonstration, which represents the beginning\nof digital workers, and obviously more intelligence needs to\nbe developed [ 66].\nY ANG et al.: DeFACT IN ManuVerse FOR PARALLEL MANUFACTURING 2193\nFig. 4. Basic structure of MF-PC.\nC. Manufacturing Foundation Models: The Cornerstone of\nDigital Workers\nCustomized small models for specialized tasks have dif-\nﬁculties in adapting to fragmented manufacturing scenario\nrequirements due to long periods and high costs of devel-\nopment. And, the prevalence of small data scenes results\nin difﬁculties in guaranteeing the accuracy of those mod-\nels [ 67], [ 68]. The birth of transformer architecture allows\ndeep learning models to have hundreds of millions of parame-\nters [69], improving their expressiveness, so a huge paradigm\nshift toward big models has been occurring, transforming\ndevelopment from workshop to industrialization, without large\namounts of labeled data [ 44]. A big model is also known as a\nfoundation model or a pretrained model, which is regarded as\nthe cornerstone of digital workers and can further enhance\ntheir perceptual and cognitive intelligence. Currently, NLP\nbig models (e.g., BERT [ 70] and GPT-3 [ 71]), CV big mod-\nels (e.g., V-MoE [ 72] and ViT [ 73]), and multimodal big\nmodels (e.g., DALL ·E[ 74], DreamFusion [ 75], and Make-\nA-Video [ 76]) have been developed, which are ulteriorly\nspecialized as ﬁeld big models or business big models accord-\ning to speciﬁc ﬁelds or tasks [ 77] and thus realize the “small\nproblems, big models, small tasks, and big operations” target.\nTo strengthen the intelligence of digital workers in manufac-\nturing scenarios and improve the efﬁciency of development for\ncustomized models, this article proposes an MF with percep-\ntual intelligence and cognitive intelligence (PC), as illustrated\nin Fig. 4, which is composed of ﬁve modules: 1) SE; 2) knowl-\nedge graph embedding; 3) single-modal feature extraction;\n4) multimodal feature and knowledge fusion; and 5) pretrained\ntasks.\nTraditionally, before algorithms are trained, feature engi-\nneering must be performed to extract the most appropri-\nate features of the raw data in order to achieve the best\nperformance [78], [79], [80]. Currently, although it has become\nthe mainstream of feature engineering in machine learn-\ning [ 81], [ 82], which greatly exploits the feature potential\nfor raw data, representation learning reduces interpretability\nand reliability to humans [ 83], [84], [85]. To deal with those\nissues, in MF-PC, SE, including calibration and certiﬁcation\n(C&C), and veriﬁcation and validation (V&V) are applied to\nguarantee humans’ visibility into the work of the machine\nand the controllability of learning features, thus achieving\ntrust in AI [ 43], so in the module, multisource heteroge-\nneous knowledge and data embedded in manufacturing CPSS\nare preprocessed to prepare for subsequent operations, such\nas generating knowledge graph embedding and augmenting\ndata [57], [86], [87].\nTo learn the implicit laws behind the data, considering\nthe different data formats, a single-modal featured extraction\nmodule is designed based on transformers to extract single-\nmodal features from data in various formats, respectively.\nBeneﬁting from their advantages, including better capture\nof long-term dependencies than convolution neural networks\n(CNNs) and suitability for parallel computing [ 69\n], [88], self-\nattention mechanisms are introduced to acquire the internal\ncorrelation of data or features. Because of the strong corre-\nlation between signal-modal features, a multimodal feature\nand knowledge fusion module with cross-modal attention is\ndeveloped to integrate cross-modal interactions and achieve\nmultiview portrayals of manufacturing scenes, inspired by\nthe multimodal transformer [ 89], [ 90]. Additionally, knowl-\nedge graph embedding [ 91] is incorporated to contribute to\nimproving the expression of models.\nMF-PC is trained by self-supervised learning, whereby the\nsupervised information is mined from a large amount of unsu-\npervised data by using the auxiliary tasks and then networks\nare trained with the constructed supervised information with-\nout the prelabeled data [ 92]. Therefore, the design of pre-\ntrained tasks is crucial to the effectiveness of models adapted\nto downstream services. For example, pretrained tasks of\nself-supervised learning for NLP include masked language\nmodeling (MLM), next sequence prediction (NSP), sentence\norder prediction (SOP), etc; pretrained tasks for CV include\n2194 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS: SYSTEMS, VOL. 53, NO. 4, APRIL 2023\nFig. 5. Automated workﬂow of customized shoes based on DeFACT: from personalized demands to competitive products.\njigsaw puzzle (JP), image inpainting (II), image coloriza-\ntion (IC), etc. [ 93]. Based on the aforementioned instances,\ncombined with the actual manufacturing applications, this\narticle proposes some pretrained tasks, such as system state\nprediction, masked state modeling, design drawing in-painting,\nand design drawing JP, which enable models to sufﬁciently\nunderstand the acquired data.\nIV . C\nASE STUDY\nA. Workﬂow and Production Line: FlexVega\nThe DeFACT framework has been realized successfully in\nSANBODY Technology Company, which possesses the auto-\nmated workﬂow of shoes with transformation for demands,\nsuch as personalized customization to competitive products\n(see Fig. 5), making it possible for on-demand production. The\ncontours of customers’ feet are captured via 3-D scanners and\nmodeled by using 3-D construction algorithms. Subsequently,\nthe 3-D models of shoe lasts are designed and made auto-\nmatically rather than manually, which the styles and comforts\nof shoes rely on. And everyone, including prosumers can\nparticipate and cooperate in the creation of shoe fashions\nthrough Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) [ 24]. After\ncustomers’ satisfaction with the design, the closed contracted\nfactories to their locations are found to execute production\nin a real-virtual interactive way. The ﬁnished shoes can be\ndelivered to customers through logistics distribution.\nIn the factory, based on CV , an unmanned production line\nof shoes named FlexVega (see Fig. 6) has been established,\nwhere 25 structured light sensors and ten mechanical arms are\ndeployed, resulting in a gratifying achievement, i.e., a decrease\nfrom 36 to 1 in the number of human workers while double\nproduction capacity. Almost all of the operations, including\nloading and unloading, edge roughing, spraying glue, and\ndetaching shoe lasts, are completely automated, allowing sim-\npletons to switch the production of different styles via a\ncontrol system. As a result, human workers do not need to\nbe exposed to unpleasant and potentially harmful working\nconditions. Obviously, DeFACT can get rid of the time and\nspace restrictions, reduce human intervention, and avoid pro-\nduction waste resulting from aesthetic discrepancies between\nconsumers.\nFig. 6.

Collaborations Between Parallel Workers\nFor a better understanding of the cooperative relationships\nbetween three types of parallel workers, their collaborative\nprocess of spraying glue on the soles is demonstrated as\nan instance in Fig. 7. After two-dimensional (2-D)/3-D data\nof soles is sensed and obtained by structured light sensors,\nglue-spraying trajectories are computed based on redeﬁned\nalgorithms by digital workers and then are transmitted to the\nrobotic workers. Thereafter, the received commands are fol-\nlowed to spray glue on soles along those trajectories by robotic\nworkers, that is, mechanical arms. To evaluate whether the\nqualities of glue-spraying meet the requirements (precision ≤\n1 mm), sensors are leveraged to remeasure 2-D/3-D data of\nglue-sprayed soles, and then digital workers compute their\nprecision by using the predeﬁned evaluation algorithm. If the\nprecision is more than 1 mm, which means their spraying\neffects are terrible, rectiﬁcation should be executed by human\nworkers, so robotic workers should place the corresponding\nsoles in a speciﬁed convenient location. Otherwise, this means\nthat the success of spraying is reached and the soles will be\nsent to the next step, where digital workers are taken as a\nbridge of communication. Afterward, human workers will do\ntheir efforts to correct the faults caused by nonhuman workers.\nDuring the current step, the evaluation algorithm is con-\nstructed through CNNs in digital workers. To solve the\nY ANG et al.: DeFACT IN ManuVerse FOR PARALLEL MANUFACTURING 2195\nFig. 7. Collaborative process of parallel workers during spraying glue on\nthe soles.\nFig. 8. Three-dimensional trajectory before and after interpolation. Green:\nBefore interpolation (Point number: 90) versus Orange: After interpolation\n(Point number: 165).\nproblem of insufﬁcient and unbalanced data, synthetic data,\nincluding real and virtual data is generated through SE [ 94]\nto train CNNs for excellent performance. According to corpo-\nrate statistics, in collaboration between nonhuman workers, the\nsuccess rate of spraying glue reaches approximately 99.9%.\nTo avoid dramatic movement of robot workers due to dis-\ncontinuities paths, nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) is\nused to interpolate original trajectories to produce smooth\ncontinuous trajectories (see Fig. 8). Clearly, the majority of\nproduction activities are conducted by nonhuman workers,\nrather than human workers, resulting in fewer employees,\ncheaper production costs, and greater labor productivity.\nFig. 9. Challenges and solutions for soft manufacturing.\nFig. 10. Procedures of 3-D deformation simulation and roughing trajec-\ntory planning for an upper. The white line represents an engineer’s manually\nmarked path as ground truth. The contour of a sole (blue line) is extracted as\ninput and then deformed to the roughing trajectory of the upper (red line) as\noutput by adapting the sole to the upper.\nC. Flexible Manufacturing: Challenges and Solutions\nFor the achievement of great glue-spraying effects of shoes,\nedge roughing around upper contours and spraying trajectory\nplanning are critical steps, where two issues that contribute to\nincreased errors must be addressed (see Fig. 9).\n1) The 3-D contours of shoes are intricate and unique,\nespecially their uppers. Even shoes of identical styles\nand sizes are different in their subtleties because of the\nprocess precision.\n2) The edges of soles and their corresponding uppers can\nnot match perfectly and they are nonrigid and prone to\ndeformation when bonded.\nGenerally, most companies perform the related procedures\nbased on the following assumptions: 1) shoes of identical\nstyles and sizes have the same 3-D contours; 2) shoes are\nregarded to be rigid and not deformable; and 3) the edges\nof soles can match perfectly with their corresponding uppers.\nIn those companies, engineers conduct manual glue spray-\ning once as a demonstration and then automated equipment\nfollow the demonstrated trajectories to spray all the shoes\nexactly [12]. As a consequence, if shoes are identical in styles\nand sizes but different in subtleties, they will be sprayed along\nthe same paths, which suffers from large errors of spraying\nglue.\nTo tackle those issues, FlexVega leverages 3-D visual\nscanning, 3-D deformation simulation, and deformation-based\ntrajectory planning as three vital technologies for the achieve-\nment of ﬂexible manufacturing with regard to spraying glue\n2196 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS: SYSTEMS, VOL. 53, NO. 4, APRIL 2023\nFig. 11. Results of roughing trajectory planning for uppers of different sizes and styles. L: Left. R:Right. PN: Point Number.\non soles and uppers. By using CV-based 3-D visual scan-\nning, the sophisticated shapes of every sole and upper are\ncaptured to contribute to customized calculation of spraying\npaths. Deformation created by bonding soles with uppers is\nsimulated and then the roughing trajectories of uppers are reli-\nably abstracted by aligning and ﬁtting sole contours to uppers\nbecause edges of soles are deﬁned clearly. The 3-D deforma-\ntion simulation technology is the most important technology\nthat can guarantee the perfect bonding of soles and uppers.\nAfter uppers are roughed for ensuring great peel strength, the\ndeformation-based trajectory planning technology is applied\nto compute roughing and spraying trajectories according to\nupper and sole contours, where CNNs are constructed for\nself-learning correction. Similarly, NURBS serves interpola-\ntion for generating smooth and continuous paths. Afterward,\nrobotic workers perform the movements of roughing and\nspraying glue ﬂexibly along the acquired paths without the\nengineer’s demonstrations. Fig. 10 illustrates the procedures of\n3-D deformation simulation and roughing trajectory planning\nfor an upper, where output and ground truth almost overlap,\nwhich proves the effectiveness of our solution. To further ver-\nify that our solution is applicable to shoes of any size and\nstyle, two types of shoes with three sizes: 39, 40, and 41 are\nutilized to test the effects of roughing trajectory planning, as\nshown in Fig. 11. Due to the lack of soles of style 2 and size\n39, we try to leverage size 40 soles to match size 39 uppers\nand still obtain a good trajectory planning effect. In conclu-\nsion, FlexVega can produce them no matter what type of shoes.\nThis means that the most challenging core difﬁculties of ﬂex-\nible manufacturing have been addressed, which stands for a\nrevolutionary advance.\nV. C\nONCLUSION\nWe introduced the DeFACT framework for smart manu-\nfacturing, speciﬁcally for the parallel manufacturing paradigm,\nand illustrated how it solves the problems of uncertainty, diver-\nsity, complexity in modeling, long-delayed responses to market\nchanges, and human engineer dependency in smart factories.\nThe DAO-based interaction, ACP, and MF-PC are introduced\nas core methodologies in DeFACT. Also, a case study of cus-\ntomized shoe workﬂow, especially the unmanned production\nline named FlexVega is taken as an example of DeFACT.\nAccordingly, DeFACT is proved to be a revolutionary break-\nthrough for solving the most difﬁcult core problems of ﬂexible\nmanufacturing.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] J.
