  "abstract": "This topic explores the integration of Retrievable Augmented Generation (RAG) with threat intelligence platforms to automate the analysis and interpretation of cyber threats. It aims to discuss how RAG can be leveraged to synthesize and contextualize vast amounts of data from various sources, including logs, threat feeds, and incident reports, to generate actionable insights. The focus would include the potential of RAG to improve the speed and accuracy of threat detection, streamline response strategies, and enhance overall cybersecurity measures by providing a deeper understanding of the threat landscape and its implications on security policies and defenses.",
