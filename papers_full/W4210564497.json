    "abstract": "The lifetime of a cast-resin transformer mainly depends on the condition of insulation material. Partial discharge (PD) is an important reason for insulation deterioration in cast-resin transformers. Identifying the position of PD is very necessary for damage assessment while the transformer is still operating, and the transformer is covered by housing. This paper proposes the investigation of a cast-resin transformer using an AE sensor and HFCT sensor to specify the precise source of PD. In this study, four AE sensors were used to find PD sources, and the high-frequency current transducer (HFCT) technique was used to identify the PD source and the criteria level. The experiment, in the first two parts, identified the possibility of PD, which includes the position of PD. The final part of the experiment verified the position of the PD source of a cast-resin transformer and confirmed the inspection results. AE and HFCT sensors can be used to detect the location of PD sources, confirming the position of the PD source by sensor detection. In addition, the evident partial discharge picture on the insulator surface of high voltage side. The process successfully and accurately identifies and locates the PD source.",
