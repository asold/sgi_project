    "abstract": "Abstract: Mental health issues that influence your emotions, thinking, and behaviour are referred to as mental illnesses, often known as mental health disorders. Depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and addictive behaviours are a few examples of mental illnesses. Many people occasionally experience issues with their mental health. Yet when persistent symptoms create regular worry and impair your capacity to perform, a mental health problem turns into a mental disorder. Mental health care is crucial in today's increasingly technological world, and neglecting such issues might have serious consequences. Thus, in order to address this issue, we are going to develop a Psychological healthcare system that is a functional retrieval based conversational artificial intelligence system that will analyze user’s psychological behaviour and provide the necessary advice for addressing these issues. The Conversational AI agent allows the User to ask any personal question about mental healthcare without having to visit the hospital in person. When a question is delivered to the Conversational AI agent, it receives a relevant response and displays it. The agent uses Natural language processing to transform the questions.",
