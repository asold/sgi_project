Though vegetable oils are eco-friendly in nature and potentially \ncould be used in transformers as a replacement for the mineral oil, ther e usage is restricted because of \ntheir oxidative instability. The present work focuses on using rapeseed oil and pongamia (pongamia \npinnata) oil as effective alternatives for the trad itional mineral oil in power transformer. The oxidative \nstability of the rapeseed oil and pongamia oil is increased by using combinations of the natural and \nsynthetic anti-oxidants as additives. The parameters like breakdown voltage, viscosity, flash point, fire \npoint are measured for the rapeseed oil and pongamia oil with and without the additives as per IEC and \nASTM standards. The results shown encouraging changes in the parameter values and ensures the use \nof the oils as a potential alternative insulation in power transformers.  \n \nKeywords: Anti-oxidants, Eco-friendly oil, Oxidative stability, Power transformers. \n \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nThe Polychloro biphenyl (PCB) was used as a non-\nflammable insulating fluid in transformers since 1932[1] \nand until 1979. PCB a highly toxic material and is \nclassified as persistent organic pollutant. Hence PCB \nproductions were banned by the United States Congress \nin 1979 and by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent \nOrganic Pollutants in 2001[2]. Later in 1978 as an \nalternative for the PCB, Isopropyl biphenyl was used as the \ndielectric insulating fluid in the power transformers [3]. \nIn addition, silicone fluids like polydimethyl siloxane \n(PDMS) and high temperature hydro carbons (HTH) were \nalso used [4, 5]. Though their insulating property was \nfound to be excellent both of them are flammable liquids \nwith high fire point. Synthetic liquids like Ester, Perchloro \nethylene are also used, as they have good dielectric \nstrength and heat transfer ch aracteristics, their high cost \nnotwithstanding. Crude oil based mineral oil are refined \nin such a way as to get the desirable property of insulation. \nThe transformer mineral oil is non-biodegradable, besides \nheavily polluting land and water. Several billion litres of \ntransformer oils are being used worldwide in the power \ntransformers as insulating and cooling medium [6]. \nNowadays, the faster exploitation of petroleum products \nmakes it necessary to conserve and reduce its usage. \nConsidering the environmental pollution it creates the need \nfor alternative sources for re placement of the transformer \nmineral oils. Vegetable oils are the alternative sources \nwhich come in handy and are available in plenty. The \nusage of vegetable oils for power capacitors was suggested \nin 1990s [7, 8]. The vegetable oils like coconut oil, \nsunflower oil were used in transformers [9, 10]. The \nvegetable oils are being used in transformers and they \nsatisfy the industry standards with regard to performance \nand other aspects [11]. \nThough we have advantages in using the vegetable oils, \nthere are some disadvantages too like high viscosity and \npoor oxidative stability [12]. As the vegetable oils are \nlacking in oxidative stability, they are used less in the \nindustries. The natural ester’s [Vegetable oil] oxidation \nstability and performance depends on the composition of \nthe fatty acids. The decrease in the oxidative stability and \nthe shelf life of the oil is due to the removal of antioxidants \n[13].The antioxidants are the chemical compounds which \nforbid the oxidation process due to oxygen. Its function is \nto interrupt the propagation of the free radical chain. The \npopular antioxidants are hydroxyl phenol compounds. \nSome of the phenolic antioxidants include Butylated \nHydroxyanisole (BHA), Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT), \nPropyl Gallate (PG) and the natural antioxidants ascorbic \nacids, α – tocopherole and these were selected after careful \nstudy. Raymon et al., performed various analyses in natural \noils like sunflower, soya bean, rice bran, corn oil [14] and \nin this work the rapeseed oil and pongamia oil in \ncombination with and without additives were selected and \nstudied their insulating properties. \n \n \n2.

Sree Renga Raja and R.Karthik \n http://www.jeet.or.kr │2349\nand catalysts respectively for improvement of the oxidation \nstability. \n \n2.1 Antioxidant \n \nAn antioxidant is a chemical  substance that forbids the \nattack of oxygen which is the oxidation process [15]. The \nantioxidants interrupt the oxidation process by reacting \nwith fat radical to form a stable radical; this does not \nreact with oxygen. In food industry it is called food \nadditive which increases the shelf life of foods by \nprotecting them against deterioration due to oxidation. \nAntioxidants decrease the action of formation of free alkyl \nradicals and thereby interrup ting the dispersion of free \nradical chain. It also acts as hydrogen donor which helps in \nreducing the dispersion of free radical chain. The general \nform of the reaction is shown as  \n \n R· + AH → RH+A·  (1) \n RO· + AH → ROH+ A·  (2) \n ROO· + AH → ROOH+ A·  (3) \n R· + A· → RA  (4) \n RO· +A· → ROA  (5) \n ROO· + A· → ROOA  (6) \n Antioxidant+O\n2 → Oxidized Antioxidant  (7) \nR· - Alkyl radical of fatty acid \nAH – Antioxidant \nRH, ROH, ROOH – Fatty acid  \nA· - Antioxidant radical  \nRO· - Alkoxy radical \nROO· - Peroxy radical \n \nThe alkyl radical (R·), alkoxy radical (RO·), peroxy \nradical (ROO·) of fatty acid reacts with the antioxidant \n(AH) and gives the fatty acid RH, ROH, ROOH and \nantioxidant radical (A·)(Eq. 1,2,3). The alkyl radical, \nalkoxy radical and peroxy radical with antioxidant radical \nreacts and gives a non-radical  product such as RA, ROA \nand ROOA (Eq. 4, 5, 6). In the process of neutralizing the \nfree radicals, the antioxidant s become oxidized, thereby \nincreasing the process of oxida tion (Eq. 7). Hence, there is \na constant need of filling of antioxidant sources [16]. \nThe most popular antioxidants are hydroxylphenol \ncompounds. They have low activation energies for hydrogen \ndonation process. The antioxidant free radicals do not \ninitiate other free radicals immediately. They react with \nthe lipid free radicals to form stable compounds. It \nfunctions as oxygen interceptors in the oxidative process \nthereby breaking the chain reaction which slows down the \noxidation process. Some common phenolic antioxidants are \nButylated Hydroxy Anisole (BHA), Butylated Hydroxy \nToluene (BHT), Propyl Gallate (PG) and Tertiary Butyl \nHydro Quinone (TBHQ). Obviously, they donate hydrogen \nto the free radicals and form as a complex between a lipid \nradical and the antioxidant radical because of the loss of \nthe hydrogen. The types of antioxidants are listed in Table 1. \nTable 1.

Synergists are the \nchemical substances which used to increase the \neffectiveness of a primary antioxidant. The copper and iron \nmetallic ions act as pro oxidants which are the catalyst in \noxidation process. Synergists are more effective when used \nalong with an antioxidant rather than in isolation. Some of \nthe synergists are citric acid, phosphoric acid, and some of \ntheir derivatives. The study shows that citric acid can be \nused in conjunction with the phenolic acid as a synergist \n[17, 18]. \n \n2.3 Eco-friendly fluids  \n \nThe rapeseed oil [19, 20] and pongamia oil [21, 22] were \nused as base fluid for testing. These oils are rich in oleic \nacid and were selected due to inherent higher stability of \nhigh oleic oils over commercial oils [23]. The Table 2 \nshows the fatty acid composition of oils [24]. The oils were \nsubjected to vacuum chamber and pressure of 50 Pa was \nmaintained upto 48 hours for degasifying to remove the \nmoisture content from it. The various parameters like \nflash point, fire point, viscosity, breakdown voltage of the \nbase fluids were tested and the results are shown in the \nTable 2.The base fluid 1 and 2 were mixed with various \ncombinations in the proportions of 2.5 g and 5 g of \nantioxidants to measure the performance of it. In addition, \nTable 2.

The breakdown voltages \nwere measured as per the standard IEC 60156 at ambient \ntemperature. The results of the samples with and without \nadditives were compared and discussed. \n \n \n3. Sample Preparation \n \nThe base oil of required quantity was taken and moisture \ncontent was measured using the Karl Fisher iteration \nmethod according to ASTM D 6304. The moisture content \nwas removed by drying the oil with silica gel pellets in \nthe ratio of 1 g of silica to 100ml of oil with a constant \nstirring of 500 rpm for 6 hours. The moisture content of \noil was less than 10ppm after drying. The antioxidants \nused as additives were of the purity grades above 99% \nand for investigation purpose the weight of 2.5 g and 5 g \nwith ratio of 1:1 was chosen. Each antioxidant of 2.5 g \nand 5 g (1:1) was directly dissolved in 500ml of base oils. \nAs there is no particular standard of temperature for mixing \nantioxidant with oil, we have maintained the room \ntemperature with an increase up to 40\n0C. The combinations \nof them were heated to a temperature of 40 0C. Then the \nmixing of antioxidant and base oil was carried out \nthoroughly by means of vigoro us mechanical agitator like \nultra sonicator. The additives were dissolved completely \nin base oils. Around forty samples were prepared \naccording to standards and Table 5 shows the samples \nprepared with two base fluids  and their combinations with \nantioxidants. \n \n \n4. Testing of Samples \n \nThe samples were prepared with several combinations \nof antioxidants and synergists according to the standard \nprocedures. The measurements of breakdown voltage, \nFlash point, Fire point, and viscosity of the prepared \nsamples were carried out with standard test procedure as \nfollows: \n \n4.1 Breakdown voltage \n \nThe dielectric breakdown voltage of an insulating liquid \nis a measure of liquid’s ability to withstand electric stress \nTable 3.

The dielectric breakdown voltage indicates \nthe presence of contaminating agents such as water, air \nbubble, dirt, cellulosic fibers, or conducting particles in the \nliquid. The breakdown voltage was measured as per the \nstandard IEC 60156 with the kit voltage capacity of 60KV . \nThe test was conducted with spherical head electrodes of \nstandard diameter with a gap of 2.5 mm between them. \nThe oil sample of 500ml was f illed up to a level of 40mm \nabove the electrodes. After filling of sample, a time \nperiod of 5 – 10 minutes was allowed for settling of air \nbubbles in the container. Then the test voltage was increased \nat the rate of 2 kV/s. Five consecutive breakdown voltages \nwere measured with a stand time of 3-5 minutes for each \nmeasurement in order to ma ke the byproducts disperse. \nThe average of five voltages was taken as the breakdown \nvoltage of the sample [25]. The sample was tested at room \ntemperature. \n \n4.2 Flash point and fire point \n \nThe flash point of the sample was measured with \nPensky-Martens closed cup tester according to the standard \nof ASTM D 93. The brass test cup was filled with the \nsample of 50ml and fitted with a lid. Sample in the \ncontainer was heated and stirred at specified rates and a test \nflame was introduced into the cup at regular intervals \nwith the interruption of stirring until a flash that spreads \nthroughout inside the cup was seen for one second. The \ncorresponding temperature measured is the flash point of \nsample. The temperature at which flash in the sample \nsustains for more than five seconds after ignition by open \nflame is the fire point and it is also measured for the \nsample. The sample was tested at the room temperature. \n \n4.3 Viscosity  \n \nThe viscosity of sample was measured using the Saybolt \nUniversal viscometer. The oil sample of 60ml was taken \nin brass cup with the size of orifice according to the \nstandard ASTM D88. The cup was surrounded by constant \ntemperature bath to maintain the sample at constant \ntemperature. After filling the cup, the cap was removed so \nthat the oil would flow into receiving flask and at the \nsame time the timer was started. The time taken for the \nflow of 60ml was measured and the viscosity of the sample \ncalculated. The sample was tested at room pressure. The \nviscosity helps in the process of heat convection in the \ntransformers. The smaller the value of viscosity, higher the \nrate of heat transfer in transformers [26, 27]. \n \n \n5. Results and Discussions \n \n5.1 Breakdown voltage \n \nThe breakdown voltage values of samples are tabulated \nin Table 6 and these are represented in Figs. 1 - 6. The \nsamples S14 and S19 of base fluid 1 show increase in \nbreakdown voltage by 59% and 63% respectively. The \nsamples S33, S39 of base fluid 2 show increase in \nbreakdown voltage by 88% and 59% respectively. Though \nit seems that the percentage enhancement in breakdown \nvoltage is more for base fluid 2, the mean value of \nbreakdown voltage is less than that of the base fluid 1. The \ncombination of Butylated Hydroxy Anisole and Butylated \nHydroxy Toluene, Butylated Hydroxy Anisole and α-\nTocopherol enhances the dielectric strength to a satisfied \nlevel. The base fluid treated w ith antioxidants releases less \namount of carbon and this helps in reducing the gas \nTable 6.

The \nflash and fire point of samples are tabulated in Table 8 and \nthese are represented in the Figs. 7 and 8. The samples 13, \n19, 33, 39 prepared with the combination of the Butylated \nHydroxy Toluene and α-Tocopherol, Butylated Hydroxy \nAnisole, and Butylated Hydroxy Toluene with higher \nconcentration have more thermal stability and show a \ngood enhancement of flash and fire points because of the \npresence of natural tocopherol and Butylated Hydroxy \nAnisole. The antioxidant reacts with free radicals and \nreduces the formation of peroxides thereby reducing \noxidation. And also the ability of antioxidant to protect \nthe base fluid depends upon the content of fatty acid of it. \nThe sample prepared with citric acid shows a lesser \nenhancement of flash and fire points due to the higher rate \nof ignition mixture formed during the reaction.\n \nFig. 1.

The samples were tested at \ntemperature of 40°C. Even at higher temperature the \nviscosity value will get reduced but this leads to formation \nof free radicals which results in sludge formation. The test \nresults of samples are shown in Table 7 and are represented \nin Figs. 9 and 10. The viscosity is inversely proportional \nto flow rate. As the viscosity  decreases, the flow rate \nincreases thereby enhancing the heat absorption. The \nsamples S14, S20 of base fluid 1 and S24, S32 of base \nfluid 2 with the combination of antioxidants have shown \ndecrement of viscosity value giving a better scope for high \nflow rate thereby making them worthy of heat absorption \nproperty. \n \n \n6. Conclusion  \n \nThe test results show the effective performance of \nnatural esters with the antioxidants. The breakdown voltage \nand Flash/Fire point of base fluid 1 and 2 have been \nenhanced with the additives of BHA, BHT, and α–T. The \nviscosity of test fluids has been decremented by the \nadditives BHT, α–T, and PG. Thus the vegetable oils \nselected for this study can be used as alternative insulating \nfluids in transformers. \nThe transformed natural esters  are better alternatives for \ntransformer mineral oil as they offer higher oxidation \nstability and less formation of  gas during reaction. The \nnatural esters are eco-friendly and the aged oil can be \neasily disposed. The costs of transformed natural esters are \nmore compared with transformer mineral oil. Nevertheless, \nthey are preferable because of their long life and less \nenvironmental pollution. \n \n \nReferences \n \n[1] Vishal, Saurabh, Vikas and Prashant, “Transformer’s \nHistory and its Insulating Oil”, 5th National Con-\nference INDIACom-2011 , Computing For Nation \nDevelopment, March 10 - 11, 2011. \n[2] M.
