    "abstract": "This paper focuses on commonalities and differences between the two mixed-signal hardware description languages VHDL-AMS and Verilog-AMS in the case of modeling heterogeneous or multi-discipline systems. The paper has two objectives. The first one consists of modeling the structure and the behavior of an airbag system using both the VHDL-AMS and the Verilog-AMS languages. Such a system encompasses several time abstractions (i.e. discrete-time and continuous-time), several disciplines, or energy domains (i.e., electrical, thermal, optical, mechanical, and chemical), and several continuous-time description formalisms (i.e., conservative-law and signal-flow descriptions). The second objective is to discuss the results of the proposed modeling process in terms of the descriptive capabilities of the VHDL-AMS and Verilog-AMS languages and of the generated simulation results. The tools used are Advance-MS from Mentor Graphics for VHDL-AMS and AMS Simulator from Cadence Design Systems for Verilog-AMS. The paper shows that both languages offer effective means to describe and simulate multi-discipline systems, although using different descriptive approaches. It also highlights current tool limitations since full language definitions are not yet supported.",
