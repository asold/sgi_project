    "abstract": "Abstract Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various applications in natural language processing and exhibited proficiency in generating programming code. We propose a framework for evaluating the code generation ability of LLMs and introduce a new metric, , which captures the granularity of accuracy according to the pass rate of test cases. The framework is intended to be fully automatic to handle the repetitive work involved in generating prompts, conducting inferences, and executing the generated codes. A preliminary evaluation focusing on the prompt detail, problem publication date, and difficulty level demonstrates the successful integration of our framework with the LeetCode coding platform and highlights the applicability of the metric.",
