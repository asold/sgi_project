  "abstract": "As technology continues to advance, an increasing number of entities are connecting to the internet, presenting significant security challenges in daily operations.Addressing these challenges has become an urgent priority.Cybersecurity threats are also evolving alongside technological progress.While rule-based and signature-based techniques have been effective in mitigating risks, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language Models (LLMs) is now essential for bolstering cybersecurity defenses against these evolving threats.This study investigates the applications, obstacles, and prospects of AI, ML, and LLMs in cybersecurity.Through an examination of various use cases, analysis of associated risks, and proposition of strategic solutions, this research aims to advance cybersecurity practices for safeguarding the digital landscape of tomorrow.",
