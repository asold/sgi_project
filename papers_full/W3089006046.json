To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst toolkit to\nsupport six Chinese NLP fundamental tasks.\nSource code, documentation, and pre-trained\nmodels are available at https://github.\ncom/HIT-SCIR/ltp.\n1 Introduction\nThere is a wide of range of existing natu-\nral language processing (NLP) toolkits such as\nCoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014), UDPipe (Straka\nand Straková, 2017), FLAIR (Akbik et al., 2019),\nspaCy,1 and Stanza (Qi et al., 2020) in English,\nwhich makes it easier for users to build tools with\nsophisticated linguistic processing. Recently, the\nneed for Chinese NLP has a dramatic increase in\nmany downstream applications. A Chinese NLP\nplatform usually includes lexical analysis (Chinese\n1https://spacy.io\nResultAnalysis\nEasy-to-useAPI\nVisualizationTool\nOutputSentenceSplitWordSegmentationPart-of-SpeechTaggingNamed Entity Recognition\nToolkit\nlexical analysis\nDependency Parsingsyntactic parsing \nSemantic Dependency Parsingsemantic parsing\npreprocess\nCorpus\nInput Processor\nSemantic Role Labeling\nFigure 1: Workﬂow of the N-LTP.

In addition, we provide the visualiza-\ntion tool and easy-to-use API to help users easily use\nN-LTP.\nword segmentation (CWS), part-of-speech (POS)\ntagging, and named entity recognition (NER)), syn-\ntactic parsing (dependency parsing (DEP)), and\nsemantic parsing (semantic dependency parsing\n(SDP) and semantic role labeling (SRL)). Unfortu-\nnately, there are relatively fewer high-performance\nand high-efﬁciency toolkits for Chinese NLP tasks.\nTo ﬁll this gap, it’s important to build a Chinese\nNLP toolkit to support rich Chinese fundamen-\ntal NLP tasks, and make researchers process NLP\ntasks in Chinese quickly.\nRecently, Qi et al. (2020) introduce the Python\nNLP toolkit Stanza for multi-lingual languages,\nincluding Chinese language. Though Stanza can\nbe directly applied for processing the Chinese texts,\nit suffers from several limitations. First, it only\nsupports part of Chinese NLP tasks. For example, it\nfails to handle semantic parsing analysis, resulting\nin incomplete analysis in Chinese NLP. Second, it\ntrained each task separately, ignoring the shared\nknowledge across the related tasks, which has been\nproven effective for Chinese NLP tasks (Qian et al.,\narXiv:2009.11616v4  [cs.CL]  23 Sep 2021\nSystem Programming Language Fully Neural State-of-the-art\nPerformance\nRich Chinese\nFundamental Tasks\nMulti-task\nLearning\nLTP (Che et al., 2010) C++ √\nUDPipe (Straka and Straková, 2017) C++ √\nFLAIR (Akbik et al., 2019) Python √ √\nStanza (Qi et al., 2020) Python √ √\nN-LTP Python √ √ √ √\nTable 1: Feature comparisons of N-LTP against other popular natural language processing toolkits.\n2015; Hsieh et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2018). Third,\nindependent modeling method will occupy more\nmemory with the increase of the number of tasks,\nwhich makes it hard to deploy for mobile devices\nin real-word scenario.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we intro-\nduce N-LTP, a PyTorch-based neural natural lan-\nguage processing toolkit for Chinese NLP, which\nwas built on the SOTA pre-trained model. As\nshown in Figure 1, given Chinese corpus as input,\nN-LTP produces comprehensive analysis results,\nincluding lexical analysis, syntactic parsing, and\nsemantic parsing. In addition, N-LTP provides\neasy-to-use APIs and visualization tool, which is\nuser-friendly.\nAs shown in Table 1, compared to the existing\nwidely-used NLP toolkits, N-LTP has the follow-\ning advantages:\n• Comprehensive Tasks.N-LTP supports rich\nChinese fundamental NLP tasks including\nlexical analysis (word segmentation, part-of-\nspeech tagging, named entity recognition),\nsyntactic parsing, and semantic parsing (se-\nmantic dependency parsing, semantic role la-\nbeling). To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe ﬁrst neural Chinese toolkit that support six\nChinese fundamental NLP tasks.\n• Multi-Task Learning. The existing NLP\ntoolkits for the Chinese language all adopt\nindependent models for each task, which ig-\nnore the shared knowledge across tasks.\nTo alleviate this issue, we propose to use the\nmulti-task framework (Collobert et al., 2011)\nto take advantage of the shared knowledge\nacross all tasks. Meanwhile, multi-task learn-\ning with a shared encoder for all six tasks can\ngreatly reduce the occupied memory and im-\nprove the speed, which makes N-LTP more\nefﬁcient, reducing the need for hardware.\nIn addition, to enable the multi-task learning\nto enhance each subtask performance, we fol-\nlow Clark et al. (2019) to adopt the distillation\nmethod single-task models teach a multi-task\nmodel, helping the multi-task model surpass\nits all single-task teachers.\n• Extensibility. N-LTP works with users’ cus-\ntom modules. Users can easily add a new\npre-trained model with a conﬁguration ﬁle, in\nwhich users can change the pretrained model\nto any BERT-like model supported by Hug-\ngingFace Transformers (Wolf et al., 2019) eas-\nily by changing the conﬁg. We have made all\ntask training conﬁguration ﬁles open-sourced.\n• Easy-to-use API and Visualization Tool.\nN-LTP provides a collection of fundamental\nAPIs, which is convenient for users to use the\ntoolkit without the need for any knowledge.\nWe also provide a visualization tool, which\nenables users to view the processing results\ndirectly. In addition, N-LTP has bindings for\nmany programming languages (C++, Python,\nJava, Rust, etc.).\n• State-of-the-art Performance.We evaluate\nN-LTP on a total of six Chinese NLP tasks,\nand ﬁnd that it achieves state-of-the-art or\ncompetitive performance at each task.\nN-LTP is fully open-sourced and can support six\nChinese fundamental NLP tasks. We hope N-LTP\ncan facilitate Chinese NLP research.\n2 Design and Architecture\nFigure 2 shows an overview of the main architec-\nture of N-LTP. It mainly consists of the compo-\nnents including a shared encoder and different de-\ncoders for each task. Our framework shares one\nencoder for leveraging the shared knowledge across\nall tasks. Different task decoders are used for each\ntask separately. All tasks are optimized simulta-\nneously via a joint learning scheme. In addition,\nthe knowledge distillation technique is introduced\nto encourage the multi-task model to surpass its\nsingle-task teacher model.\nELECTRA\nCWS\nPOSNERDEPSRLSDP\ns! s\" … s#[CLS] [SEP]\nℎ! ℎ\" ℎ$ℎ[&'(] ℎ[(*+]\nOther Tasks\nCWS\nShared Encoder\nInput Sentences\n…\nFigure 2: The architecture of the proposed model.\n2.1 Shared Encoder\nMulti-task framework uses a shared encoder to ex-\ntract the shared knowledge across related tasks,\nwhich has obtained remarkable success on various\nNLP tasks (Qin et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020;\nZhou et al., 2021). Inspired by this, we adopt\nthe SOTA pre-trained model (ELECTRA) (Clark\net al., 2020) as the shared encoder to capture shared\nknowledge across six Chinese tasks.\nGiven an input utterance s = ( s1,s2,...,s n),\nwe ﬁrst construct the input sequence by adding\nspeciﬁc tokens s= ([CLS],s1,s2,...,s n,[SEP]),\nwhere [CLS] is the special symbol for represent-\ning the whole sequence, and [SEP] is the spe-\ncial symbol to separate non-consecutive token se-\nquences (Devlin et al., 2019). ELECTRA takes\nthe constructed input and output the corresponding\nhidden representations of sequence H = (h[CLS],\nh1,h2,..., hn, h[SEP]).\n2.2 Chinese Word Segmentation\nChinese word segmentation (CWS) is a prelim-\ninary and important task for Chinese natural lan-\nguage processing (NLP). InN-LTP, following Xue\n(2003), CWS is regarded as a character based se-\nquence labeling problem.\nSpeciﬁcally, given the hidden representations H\n= (h[CLS], h1,h2,..., hn, h[SEP]), we adopt a\nlinear decoder to classify each character:\nyi = Softmax(WCWShi + bCWS), (1)\nwhere yi denotes the label probability distribution\nof each character; WCWS and bCWS are trainable\nparameters.\n2.3 POS Tagging\nPart-of-speech (POS) tagging is another fundamen-\ntal NLP task, which can facilitate the downstream\ntasks such as syntactic parsing. Following the dom-\ninant model in the literature (Ratnaparkhi, 1996;\nHuang et al., 2015), POS tagging can be treated as\na sequence labeling task.\nSimilar to CWS, we take the sequence of hidden\nrepresentations H as input and output the corre-\nsponding POS sequence labels, which is formu-\nlated as:\nyi = Softmax(WPOShi + bPOS), (2)\nwhere yi denotes the POS label probability distri-\nbution of the i-th character; hi is the ﬁrst sub-token\nrepresentation of word si.\n2.4 Named Entity Recognition\nThe named entity recognition (NER) is the task\nof ﬁnding the start and end of an entity (people,\nlocations, organizations, etc.) in a sen-\ntence and assigning a class for this entity.\nTraditional, NER is regarded as a sequence la-\nbeling task. After obtaining the hidden representa-\ntions H, we follow Yan et al. (2019a) to adopt the\nAdapted-Transformer to consider direction-\nand distance-aware characteristic, which can be\nformulated as:\nˆhi = AdaptedTransformer(hi), (3)\nwhere ˆH = (ˆh[CLS], ˆh1,ˆh2,..., ˆhn, ˆh[SEP]) are\nthe updated representations.\nFinally, similar to CWS and POS, we use a linear\ndecoder to classify label for each word:\nyi = Softmax(WNER ˆhi + bNER), (4)\nwhere yi denotes the NER label probability distri-\nbution of each character.\n2.5 Dependency Parsing\nDependency parsing is the task to analyze the se-\nmantic structure of a sentence. In N-LTP, we im-\nplement a deep biafﬁne neural dependency parser\n(Dozat and Manning, 2017) and einser algorithm\n(Eisner, 1996) to obtain the parsing result, which\nis formulated as:\nr(head)\ni = MLP(head)(hi)\nr(dep)\nj = MLP(dep)(hj)\n(5)\nAfter obtaining r(head)\ni and r(dep)\nj , we compute\nthe score for each dependency i↶jby:\nyi↶j = BiAfﬁne(rdep\ni ,rhead\nj ). (6)\nTask 1ModelTask 2Model\nTask kModel\nMulti-TaskModel\nTask 1LabelsTask 2Labels\nTask kLabels⋮ ⋮1−𝜆 𝜆\ndistill train\nFigure 3: We follow Clark et al. (2019) to adopt the dis-\ntillation method. This is an overview of the distillation\nmethod. λ is increased linearly from 0 to 1 over the\ncurriculum of training.\nThe above process is also used for scoring a\nlabeled dependency i\nl\n↶j, by extending the 1-dim\nvector s into Ldims, where Lis the total number\nof dependency labels.\n2.6 Semantic Dependency Parsing\nSimilar to dependency parsing, semantic depen-\ndency parsing (Che et al., 2012, SDP) is a task\nto capture the semantic structure of a sentence.\nSpeciﬁcally, given an input sentence, SDP aims at\ndetermining all the word pairs related to each other\nsemantically and assigning speciﬁc predeﬁned se-\nmantic relations. Following Dozat and Manning\n(2017), we adopt a biafﬁne module to perform the\ntask, using\npi↶j = sigmoid(yi↶j). (7)\nIf pi↶j >0.5, wordi to wordj exists an edge.\n2.7 Semantic Role Labeling\nSemantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task of de-\ntermining the latent predicate-argument structure\nof a sentence, which can provide representations\nto answer basic questions about sentence meaning,\nincluding who did what to whom, etc. We adopt\nan end-to-end SRL model by combining a deep\nbiafﬁne neural network and a conditional random\nﬁeld (CRF)-based decoder (Cai et al., 2018).\nThe biafﬁne module is similar to Section 2.5 and\nthe CRF layer can be formulated as:\nP(ˆy|s) =\n∑\nj=1 exp f(yi,j−1,yi,j,s)∑\ny′\ni\n∑\nj=1 exp f(y′\ni,j−1,y′\ni,j,s) (8)\nwhere ˆy represents an arbitrary label sequence\nwhen predicate is si, and f(yi,j−1,yj,s) computes\nthe transition score from yi,j−1 to yi,j.\nFigure 4: A minimal code snippet.\n2.8 Knowledge Distillation\nWhen there exist a large number of tasks, it’s dif-\nﬁcult to ensure that each task task beneﬁts from\nmulti-task learning (Clark et al., 2019).\nTherefore, we follow BAM (Clark et al., 2019)\nto use the knowledge distillation to alleviate this\nissue, which is shown Figure 3. First, we train each\ntask as the teacher model. Then, N-LTP learns\nfrom each trained single-task teacher model while\nlearning from the gold-standard labels simultane-\nously.\nFollowing BAM (Clark et al., 2019), we adopt\nteacher annering distillation algorithm. More\nspeciﬁcally, instead of simply shufﬂing the datasets\nfor our multi-task models, we follow the task sam-\npling procedure from Bowman et al. (2018), where\nthe probability of training on an example for a\nparticular task τ is proportional to |Dτ|0.75. This\nensures that tasks with large datasets don’t overly\ndominate the training.\n3 Usage\nN-LTP is a PyTorch-based Chinese NLP toolkit\nbased on the above model. All the conﬁgurations\ncan be initialized from JSON ﬁles, and thus it is\neasy for users to use N-LTP where users just need\none line of code to load the model or process the in-\nput sentences. Speciﬁcally, N-LTP can be installed\neasily by the command:\n$ pip install ltp\nIn addition, N-LTP has bindings available for\nmany programming languages, including C++,\nPython, Java and RUST directly.\n3.1 Easy-to-use API\nWe provide rich easy-to-use APIs, which enables\nusers to easily use without the need for any knowl-\nedge.

The output\nis visualized by our visualization demo.\na minimal usage of N-LTP for downloading mod-\nels, annotating a sentence with customized models,\nand predicting all annotations.\n3.2 Visualization Tool\nIn addition, a visualization tool is proposed for\nusers to view the processing results directly. Specif-\nically, we build an interactive web demo that runs\nthe pipeline interactively, which is publicly avail-\nable at http://ltp.ai/demo.html. The vi-\nsualization tool is shown in Figure 5.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Experimental Setting\nTo evaluate the efﬁciency of our multi-task model,\nwe conduct experiments on six Chinese tasks.\nThe N-LTP model is based on the Chinese\nELECTRA base (Cui et al., 2020). The learning\nratio (lr) for teacher models, student model and\nCRF layer is {1e−4}, {1e−4}, {1e−3}, re-\nspectively. The gradient clip value adopted in our\nexperiment is 1.0 and the warmup proportion is\n0.02. We use BertAdam (Devlin et al., 2019) to\noptimize the parameters and adopted the suggested\nhyper-parameters for optimization.\n4.2 Results\nWe compare N-LTP with the state-of-the-art\ntoolkit Stanza. For a fair comparison, we\nconduct experiments on the same datasets that\nStanza adopted.\nThe results are shown in Table 2, we have the\nfollowing observations:\n• N-LTP outperforms Stanza on four common\ntasks including CWS, POS, NER, and DEP by\na large margin, which shows the superiority\nof our proposed toolkit.\n• The multi-task learning outperforms the\nmodel with independently trained. This is\nbecause that the multi-task framework can\nconsider the shared knowledge which can pro-\nmote each task compared with the indepen-\ndently training paradigm.\n4.3 Analysis\n4.3.1 Speedup and Memory Reduction\nIn this section, we perform the speed and memory\ntest on the Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB and all models\nwere speed-tested on the 10,000 sentences of the\nPeople’s Daily corpus with a batch size of 8. In\nall experiments, N-LTP performs six tasks (CWS,\nPOS, NER, DEP, SDP, SRL) whileStanza only\nconduct four tasks (CWS, POS, NER, DEP).\n210 corpus for training CWS task includes PKU, MSR,\nAS, CITYU, XU, CTB, UDC, CNC, WTB and ZX.\n3http://ir.hit.edu.cn/sdp2020ccl\nTask Model Dataset Metric State-of-the-art N-LTP N-LTP\nPerformance trained separately trained jointly\nCWS BERT (Huang et al., 2019) 10 Corpus 2 F1 97.10 97.42 97.50\nPOS Glyce+BERT (Meng et al., 2019) CTB9 F1 93.15 94.57 95.17\nNER ZEN (Diao et al., 2020) MSRA F1 95.25 94.95 95.78\nNER DGLSTM-CRF (Jie and Lu, 2019) OntoNotes F1 79.92 84.08 84.38\nSRL BiLSTM-Span (Ouchi et al., 2018) CONLL12 F1 75.75 78.20 81.65\nDEP Joint-Multi-BERT (Yan et al., 2019b) CTB9 F1LAS 81.71 81.69 84.03\nSDP SuPar 3 CCL20204 F1LAS 80.38 76.27 75.76\nTable 3: The results of N-LTP comparation to other state-of-the-art performance..\nStanza N-LTP (separately) N-LTP (jointly)0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300Sents/s\n56.16\n93.98\n242.03\nSpeed\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\nMB1227.70\n2471.60\n651.00\nMemory\nFigure 6: Speed and Memory test for N-LTP.\nSpeedup We compare the speed be-\ntween Stanza, N-LTP-separately and\nN-LTP-jointly and the results are shown\nin Figure 6. From the results of speed test, we\nhave two interesting observations: (1) N-LTP\ntrained separately achieves the x1.7\nspeedup compared with Stanza. We attribute\nthat N-LTP adopts the transformer as an encoder\nthat can be calculated in parallel while Stanza\nuses LSTM which can only process sentences\nword by word; (2) N-LTP trained jointly\nwith distillation obtains the x4.3 speedup\ncompared with separate modeling paradigm. This\nis because that our model utilizes the multi-task\nto perform all tasks while the independent models\ncan be only processed all tasks in a pipeline mode.\nMemory Reduction For memory test, we\nhave the following observation: (1) N-LTP\ntrained separately occupy more memory\nthan Stanza. This is because N-LTP per-\nforms six tasks while Stanza only conduct four\ntasks. (2) Though performing six tasks, N-LTP\ntrained jointly only requires half the mem-\nory compared to Stanza. We attribute it to the\nfact that the multi-task framework with a shared\nencoder can greatly reduce the running memory.\n4.3.2 Comparation with Other SOTA Single\nModels\nTo further verify the effectiveness of N-LTP, we\ncompare our framework with the existing state-of-\nthe-art single models on six Chinese fundamental\ntasks. In this comparison, we conduct experiments\non the same wildly-used dataset in each task for a\nfair comparison. In addition, we use BERT rather\nthan ELECTRA as the shared encoder, because the\nprior work adopts BERT.\nTable 3 shows the results, we observe that our\nframework obtains best performance on ﬁve out\nof six tasks including CWS, POS, NER, SRL, and\nDEP, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our\nframework. On the SDP task, N-LTP underper-\nforms the best baseline. This is because many tricks\nare used in the prior model for SDP task and we\njust use the basic multi-task framework.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we presentedN-LTP, an open-source\nneural language technology platform supporting\nChinese. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nﬁrst Chinese toolkit that supports six fundamen-\ntal Chinese NLP tasks. Experimental results show\nN-LTP obtains state-of-the-art or competitive per-\nformance and has high speed.. We hope N-LTP\ncan facilitate Chinese NLP research.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their de-\ntailed and constructive comments. The ﬁrst three\nauthors contributed equally.
