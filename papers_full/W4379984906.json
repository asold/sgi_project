INTRODUCTION\nAs a well-known power system element, the transformer\nis an electromagnetic device that transforms the voltage\nlevel at the same power transfer and frequency in the elec-\ntrical network [1]. There are two types of transformers:\npower transformers that supply electric energy and instru-\nment transformers that measure power system signals [2].\nThe protection of this critical device is essential for the\nsystem’s operation [3].\nResonance is one of the most significant phenomena affect-\ning transformers’ operation [4]. Various types of resonances\nmay influence the operation of transformers [5]. Transformer\nresonance may occur due to the inductive and capacitive\nnature of the transformer windings and the connected power\nsystem, which can occur at a frequency different than the\npower frequency [6]. Most of the resonances in the trans-\nformer cause a harmful effect that needs to be prevented by\nprotection methods [7]. The Diverse nature of transformers’\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Hui Ma\n.\nresonance is classified in [8] based on how they affect the\nsystem.\nMeasurement and modeling of transformers in a wide\nfrequency range not only help to optimize the design of\nthe transformer but also provide insight into the risk of\nresonance during various transformer operations [9], [10].\nSeveral types of solutions have been investigated to protect\ntransformers against resonance faults [11]. These solutions\nare categorized as parallel damper circuits [12], series com-\nponents [13], and solid-state protection devices [14]. Parallel\ndampers are nonlinear resistors known as surge arresters,\nor R-C circuits, which are mature solutions for transformer\novervoltage protection [15]. They can be series components\nsuch as fast frequency suppressing circuits (FTSC) [16] and\nfrequency-dependent devices (FDDs) [17]. In addition, the\nsolid-state device includes controllable switches, a capacitor\nbank, or a reactor that can help to eliminate the overvoltages\ndue to transformer resonance successfully [18], [19].\nThis paper aims to provide a clear review of significant\nconcerns of resonance occurrence for the most crucial part\nof the power system (transformers). The main purpose of this\npaper is to provide a review of the most important reasons\n58692 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Heidary et al.: Transformer Resonance: Reasons, Modeling Approaches, Solutions\nfor transformer resonance occurrence, transformer modeling\napproaches, and the industrial methods to suppress trans-\nformer resonance overvoltage.\nThis paper is organized in the following way. Section II\ndeals with the reasons for resonance occurrence in transform-\ners, presented based on recently reported scientific research.\nIn section III, different methods to measure the resonance of\ntransformers are expressed. Next, the methods to suppress\nthe resonance of transformers are debated, and their main\nfeatures are extracted. Section IV deals with the existing pro-\ntection topologies. Finally, section V summarizes the results\nand provides insight for future work in this field.\nII. REASONS FOR TRANSFORMERS’ RESONANCE\nTwo main reasons for the resonance occurrence are the\nhigh voltage multiple restrikes or the power line switch-\ning because of either the fault and protection equipment\noperation or renewable resources management [20]. When\nthe system’s topology changes, the predominantly induc-\ntive circuit changes to capacitive and the other way around.\nConsequently, the system is exposed to oscillations with\ndifferent frequencies and amplitudes [21], and therefore, the\ncomponents like transformers may experience resonances\nduring the system transient [22]. The reasons for resonance\noccurrence are presented in the following subsections.\nA. TRANSFORMER RESONANCE OCCURRING DUE TO\nLIGHTNING EFFECT\nLightning overvoltages are the crucial source of transformer\nresonance when the lightning impulse occurs in the vicinity\nof a power transformer [23]. Lightning modeling is explained\nin [24], [25], [26], and [27]. These models include electro-\nmagnetic models, distributed-circuit models, and engineering\nmodels. In the case of the electrical system studies engi-\nneering model comprises of Duality of Engineering models,\nlightning striking tall objects, and ground-truth testing are\nemployed [24]. As shown in Fig. 1, there are four types\nof lightning strikes in power systems: lightning strike to\na ground wire, phase conductor, ground near towers [24],\nas well as to a wind generator tower, which causes a surge that\nproceeds toward the transformer [28]. Generally, it occurs\ndue to their height and installation location. Under these cir-\ncumstances, several tens of kilo amperes may flow from the\ntower, which can induce a high overvoltage nearby the power\ntransformers [28]. The lightning current usually includes a\ncurrent with a high rate of rise, around 10 kA/µs, and a slower\nrate of fall, such as 0.6 kA/µs [29], demonstrating a variety\nof harmonic contents.\nThis signal can induce a voltage with different harmon-\nics and stimulate the transformer’s resonance frequency\nafter the lightning strike takes place [30]. The explained\nphenomenon can easily affect transformers with resonance\novervoltage, partially or totally damaging the transformer’s\nisolation [30]. Therefore, the best approach is to examine\nthe transformer using the lightning test before finalizing the\nFIGURE 1. Various types of lightning strict to the power line and wind\ntower.\nFIGURE 2. Transformer lightning test, described on voltage diagram.\nFIGURE 3. Configuration of transformer and circuit breaker.\nmanufacturing process [31] and protect transformers against\nlightning effects [32], which this standard is provided in IEEE\nStd 998™ -2012. In this standard, firstly, the detail of charge\nformation in the cloud is expressed to show various charge\ndistributions in lightning, and then the shield wire design is\ndefined in detail to protect the transformer of the substation\nfrom lightning strikes [32]. The standard test of the induced\nvoltage of lightning (transformer lightning test) is shown in\nFig. 2 [33], considering that this voltage waveform is similar\nto a lightning impulse [34].\nB. TRANSFORMER RESONANCE OCCURRED DUE TO\nBREAKER SWITCHING\nCircuit breakers are a crucial part of the power system,\nwhich generally either operate to protect the power system\nfrom fault current damage or disconnect the unloaded trans-\nformer [35]. Fig. 3 depicts the configuration of the circuit\nbreaker and the transformer.\nBy opening the circuit of the unloaded transformer, over-\nvoltage occurs on both the circuit breaker and the transformer\nVOLUME 11, 2023 58693\nA. Heidary et al.: Transformer Resonance: Reasons, Modeling Approaches, Solutions\nFIGURE 4. Operation procedure of the circuit breaker.\ndue to the magnetic energy stored in the transformer [36].\nEquations (1) and (2) define the transformer and the circuit\nbreaker voltages, respectively, throughout the breaking pro-\ncess by ignoring the damping effect [36].\nUt = Ich\n√\nLm\n/\nCt (1)\nUcb = Ekr .v.t (2)\nHere, Ut and Ucb are the voltage of the transformer and the\ncircuit breaker, respectively. Ich is the chopping current of the\ncircuit breaker, Lm and Ct are the magnetization inductance\nand the transformer capacitor, Ekr is the electric field between\nthe contacts, v is the speed of contact separation, and t refers\nto the time.\nFig. 4(a)-(e) depicts the operation sequence of the circuit\nbreaker. It clarifies that during the operation of the circuit\nbreaker, the electric arc will be formed and interrupted several\ntimes. Finally, the breaker reaches the end of the cycle, where\nmaximum isolation is applied, and the arc interrupts perma-\nnently [37]. The no-load transformer can easily face reso-\nnance overvoltage considering harmonically polluted voltage\nduring the breaker’s operation [38], [39].\nFig. 5 illustrates an example of the open no-load trans-\nformer voltage during the vacuum circuit breaker operation to\nopen no-load transformer. Reference [38] provides analytical\nand experimental tests of CB prestrike and restrike effects\non the winding of the transformer. By performing a test\nsetup of three-phase switching of a CB by applying different\ncable lengths at different loading conditions, the occurred\nresonance overvoltage of the transformer was studied. The\nobtained results clarify the effects of vacuum CB operation\non the transformer overvoltage. This operation may cause the\ntransformer resonance.\nAnother reason that may cause resonance is the no-loaded\ntransformer energization. By closing the breaker to the ener-\ngized transformer, the fast transient phenomenon may excite\nresonance in the internal transformer windings, causing high\nvoltage overvoltages [10].\nC. TRANSFORMER RESONANCE OCCURRED DUE TO THE\nOPEN BREAKER EFFECTS\nAfter power line interruption, the no-loaded transformer\nis always connected in series with the circuit breaker,\nFIGURE 5. The voltage of the transformer during circuit breaker operation.\nFIGURE 6. Equivalent circuit of the transformer and open circuit breaker.\nFIGURE 7. Ferroresonance overvoltage of the transformer.\nconsidering there is no transient phenomenon in the power\nsystem. In this state, the circuit breaker behaves as a series\ncapacitor, and the transformer (power or voltage transformer)\nis a large reactor [40]. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 6.\nConsidering the open circuit breaker capacitive model,\na series resonance [41] may occur. However, by increasing\nthe transformer current, the core will reach the saturation\nregion, and the ferroresonance may happen [42].\nIn addition, the harmonic content of voltage during the\nferroresonance can cause many harmonic for nearby trans-\nformers [43], [44]. An example of the voltage signal of\nthe transformer in the ferroresonance state is presented in\nFig. 7 [19].\nObserving Fig. 8, the nonlinear ferroresonance voltage\nof the transformer causes overvoltages higher than 2 p.u.\nAdditionally, in the case of transformer ferroresonance, equa-\ntion (3) presents the nonlinear characteristic of the trans-\nformer as a generic n-order polynomial. The order n is\ndefined by the character of the transformer’s core. Then\napplying the derivative to (3) transformer voltage can be\n58694 VOLUME 11, 2023\nA.

TRANSFORMER RESONANCE DUE TO NONLINEAR\nLOADS\nThe introduction of DC systems and DC nonlinear loads con-\ntribute to the increase of power system harmonic content [45].\nSome harmonics may be close to the resonance frequency\nof large transformers [46]. Considering the power quality\nstandard IEC 61000 in the power system, the magnitude\nof these harmonics should not exceed the values defined\nin the standard. However, the harmonics’ magnitude might\nrise because of a power system malfunction, faults, or heavy\nnonlinear load switching [47], [48], resulting in transformer\nresonance and overvoltage. Due to the injection of harmonics\nin the transformer [49], as depicted in Fig. 8.\nAccording to IEEE Std 1159-1995, the amplitude of the\nharmonics and the total harmonic distortion should be below\nthe permissible values [50]. However, in system dynam-\nics and power equipment interactions, the harmonic content\ncan be increased and induce transformer resonance [51].\nAn example of the resonance possibility due to generated\nharmonics of the HVDC voltage source converter (VSC) in\nthe High V oltage Direct Current (HVDC) power system is\ngiven in Fig. 9 [52]. It is shown that the transformer can be\nexposed to a risk of resonance caused by nonlinear power\nelectronic devices, mainly triggered by the harmonics of the\n30th-60th order.\nE. TRANSFORMER RESONANCE CAUSED BY CABLE\nMODEL\nIn the power system, the high-voltage cable is used for\npower transmission or distribution between substations\naround urban areas. Accurate cable modeling is needed\nto investigate the interaction between the cable and the\ntransformer [53]. The theoretical formulation of the cable,\nconsidering bundle-shielded cable as the most common cable,\nshows the capacitive cable’s impedance in various har-\nmonic domains [54], which may interact with the inductive\nimpedance of the transformer.\nFIGURE 9. Harmonic pollution of the transformer connected to VSC.\nFIGURE 10. Cable-transformer model.\nThe cable’s analysis conducted in the power system tran-\nsient studies [55] proves its influence on the overvoltage and\nresonance [56], as it is illustrated in Fig. 10.\nConsidering the R-L-C models of the transformer and the\ncable, many resonance points may appear, which can be\nstimulated by the harmonic content of fast transients and\ncause transformer overvoltage. The critical length of the\nconnected cables in both the primary and secondary of the\ntransformer is determined by the travel time or the cable’s\nresonance frequency and the transformer’s resonance fre-\nquency which can be the main reason for transformer dam-\nage by overvoltage [57]. Mostly, cables have been modeled\nusing frequency-dependent models designed using the cable’s\ngeometry [58] to study their effects. One of the cases in which\nresonance overvoltage occurs is where the transformer’s sec-\nondary side is not loaded, and its primary winding is con-\nnected to the grid by a cable [59].\nIII. METHODS OF TRANSFORMER RESONANCE\nMEASUREMENT AND MODELING\nThis section presents the method which is currently applied\nfor the transformer’s frequency-dependent modeling and\nmeasurement. Data is categorized, including theoretical mod-\neling of transformer resonance and measurement methods.\nA. FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT MODELING OF THE\nTRANSFORMER\nThe possibility of resonance between the transformer and\nthe rest of the power system equipment concerns designers\nVOLUME 11, 2023 58695\nA. Heidary et al.: Transformer Resonance: Reasons, Modeling Approaches, Solutions\nFIGURE 11. Example configuration of transformer black box model.\nand system providers. Thus, the transient analysis of the\ntransformer and its accurate modeling is vital for protecting\ntransformers against resonance overvoltage [60]. The mostly\nused transformer modeling approaches are:\n• Black box model [61], [62], [63], [64],\n• White box model (physical model) [65], [66], [67], [68],\n• Gray box model (hybrid model) [65], [69], [70], [71],\n[72].\n1) BLACK BOX MODEL\nIn this model, the transformer is considered a black box,\nand then the electrical behavior of internal circuits is studied\nbased on measurements [61]. The back box model is the\nstandard and traditional method proposed in 1988, which\nhelps to understand power transformers’ behavior within the\nhigh-frequency range [61].\nAs a black box, the three-phase transformer is connected\nto the source and the measurement device, and its behavior\nis examined [62]. In this model, the source can be considered\nas a sinusoidal variable frequency [62] or an impulse gen-\nerator [63], while the oscilloscope records measured signals\nfrom a terminal of the black-boxed transformer [62], [63].\nApplying different configurations to this black box (short\ncircuit or open circuit connection), connecting specific ter-\nminals with the source, and measuring currents and/or volt-\nages is used to approximate admittance matrix elements [64].\nAn example of a black box model setup for the single phase\nand zero phase injection test for the black box model of the\ntransformer is illustrated in Fig. 11 [62].\n2) WHITE BOX MODEL\nWhite box models, also known as physical models, are based\non either FEM (Finite Element Method) or analytical analysis\nof R-L-C elements that define the transformer’s characteristic\n(also called a detailed model). The white box is a model\nconsidering the geometry of all layers in the transformer, such\nas conductors, isolators, and core, as well as their interaction.\nThe simulation of the transformer used to extract the results\nrequires a long computational processing time due to the large\nmatrices, with elements that should be computed for each\nfrequency of the selected bandwidth [65].\nThe geometrical position of winding turns, the cross-section\nof the core, and the cross-section of the windings’ wire\nare considered in a FEM transformer model [66]. More-\nover, the capacitor calculation method between winding\ndisks can be implemented using series-parallel capacitors,\nFIGURE 12. Example configuration for transformer’s white box model.\nwhich improves the accuracy of the transformer white box\nmodel [67]. A 3D design and a 2D scheme can focus on a\nsimplified simulated model of a section of the transformer\nto increase the accuracy of the transformer FEM model.\nAccording to the procedure of the white box model, the\nself-inductance of each turn or disk can be calculated, and\nthen the mutual inductance of windings (between the disk\nof windings or between HV-LV) is studied. In addition,\nthe capacitance of each disk to the transformer tank and\ncapacitance between disks and between HV to LV winding is\nneeded to create a comprehensive model [68]. An example of\nan accurate calculation of the inductance and capacitance of\na transformer coil is illustrated based on geometrical features\nin Fig. 12.\n3) GRAY BOX MODEL\nThe gray box model (so-called hybrid model) comprises a\ncombination of black box and white box models, which is\nthe method to provide faster and more accurate analysis [69].\nIn this method, firstly, a signal is applied as input of the\ntransformer, and the output as a system response is measured.\nThen, the transfer function is calculated using the transformer\ninput and output. This model is improved by considering the\nwinding geometry and FEM to calculate self- and mutual\ninductance [70]. In [71], the R-L-C model of the trans-\nformer is described, and it shows that the most critical issue\nof the gray box model is its ability to identify the model\nparameters when no information about the geometry of the\ntransformer is available. Therefore, it is a practical method\nto model transformers with unidentified geometry or an old\ntransformer (referred to as dielectric aging) and to diagnose\nthe problem of the power system-connected transformer [72].\nIn addition, by simplifying the gray box model, it will be\npossible to improve the analysis and parameter estimation\nof the model faster and more accurately [65]. By developing\nSTM (Simplified Transient Model) in [65], the advantages of\nthe method are presented as follows:\n• The time simulation is adequately low.\n• Using STM along with the other models of power net-\nwork elements for power system studies and analysis is\npossible.\n• The parameter identification of STM does not need any\ncostly and time-consuming measurements.\n• Considering the effects of faults on STM is possible.\nB. TRANSFORMER RESONANCE STUDY BASED ON\nTRANSFORMER MODEL\nOne of the vital goals of studying transformer models in the\nwideband frequency domain is the detection of the resonance\n58696 VOLUME 11, 2023\nA. Heidary et al.: Transformer Resonance: Reasons, Modeling Approaches, Solutions\nFIGURE 13. Example of transformer resonance diagnosed by frequency\nsweep.\nfrequencies of the transformer [73]. The resonance frequen-\ncies closely depend on the type of transformer and its design\nconditions, which can be estimated by the nodal admittance\nmeasurement [73]. The frequency-dependent impedance of\nthe transformer is a crucial issue that has to be studied to find\nextreme impedance points that show the resonance frequency\npoints and transformer phase changes [9]. By studying the\nresonance frequency of the transformer, it is observed that it\nmay cause disk overvoltage. This overvoltage can occur for\nseveral resonance frequencies, and the overvoltage magnitude\nmight reach more than 5 p.u [74].\nFor monitoring power transformer resonance, electromag-\nnetic simulation by EMTP software and using algorithms to\ndiagnose resonance class is suggested in [75]:\nFor the transformer resonance determination and voltage\ndistribution in each coil, it is investigated that a sinusoidal\nimpulse with a 250 ns period is applied to the transformer\nwinding. Then in [76], it is recommended that before apply-\ning the single-transmission line model (STLM) method to\ncalculate transformer overvoltage against the transient, actual\nmeasurement of the frequency characteristic of the inter-turn\nvoltage distribution, the resonant frequencies and the ampli-\ntude of the inter-turn overvoltage should be considered.\nFig. 13 depicts an example of the magnitude of the trans-\nformer’s impedance as a function of frequency and points out\nthe resonance frequencies.\nC. TRANSFORMER RESONANCE MEASUREMENT\nMETHODS\nIn this subsection, the methods of transformer measurement\nare introduced. These methods are widely used to extract\nthe resonance frequency of transformers in practice. These\nmethods provide appropriate protection of the transformer\naround the resonance frequency points [10].\nThe frequency response analysis (FRA) test is based on\nmeasuring the transformer response in a wide frequency\nbandwidth, which is known as a vital method to diagnose\nresonance frequencies of transformer [6]. This method is\npresented in IEC 60076-18. The FRA device consists of three\nchannels. The first channel comprises a source connected in\nseries with a resistor. The second channel provides a reference\nvalue using a voltage drop on a 50  resistor, and the third\nFIGURE 14. Example of transformer measurement using omicron SFRA.\nFIGURE 15. Example of transformer measurement using bode 100 VNA.\nchannel is the measurement port [77]. There are two types\nof FRA, depending on their internal source. The first type\nis designed based on an impulse source frequency response\nanalyzer (IFRA), and the second one is designed using a\nsinusoidal sweep frequency response analyzer (SFRA) [77].\nSFRA is the most commonly used device.\nFRA test is a method to test the terminal or internal reso-\nnance of various types of transformers as complex electrical\ncircuits [78]. In addition, it is an appropriate test method\nto study wideband analysis of transformer admittance and\nmodeling of transformer [79], [80], [81]. Omicron SFRA is\na commonly utilized device to test power transformers to\ndiagnose their internal faults or resonance overvoltage [82].\nFig. 14 depicts the interface of the Omicron device in fre-\nquency sweep [83].\nThe second wideband measurement method uses a vec-\ntor network analyzer (VNA) device [84]. The most crucial\ndifference between VNA and SFRA is the different types\nof connection to the transformer, and only SFRA passes\nthe requirement of the standard for transformer measure-\nment [84], [85]. In [85], transformer measurements were\ncompared for black-box modeling by employing two differ-\nent methods and measurement equipment (sFRA and VNA).\nThese two methods had a close agreement in the different\nranges of frequencies (up to several MHz). For the frequen-\ncies higher than the MHz range, the results obtained by the\nVNA device were shifted to higher frequencies compared\nwith the results measured with the SFRA. Fig. 15 shows\nVNA (Bode 100) and its measurement interface.\nIV. SOLUTIONS FOR TRANSFORMER RESONANCE\nBy taking into account the state-of-the-art about transformer\nprotection against resonance overvoltage, several solutions\nVOLUME 11, 2023 58697\nA. Heidary et al.: Transformer Resonance: Reasons, Modeling Approaches, Solutions\nFIGURE 16. Configuration of surge arrester to protect transformer\nresonance.\nFIGURE 17. Configuration of surge capacitor to prevent transformer\nresonance.\nhave been introduced to suppress transient effects in power\ntransformers. These structures are series or parallel protection\ndevices that can act as filters to reduce and suppress transient\nresonance overvoltage [11]. Due to the operation, the con-\ntent of harmonics that stimulate the transformer’s resonance\nfrequency will decrease to the acceptable value. The parallel\nprotection equipment imposes mainly the capacitive-resistive\nmodel in parallel with the transformer, and series protection\ncomponents impose the inductive-resistive model in series\nwith the transformer; their operation is based on magnetic\neffects [12], [86], [87], [88], [89], [90], [91], [92], [93], [94],\n[95], [96], [97], [98].\nA. THE PARALLEL-CIRCUIT SOLUTION AGAINST\nTRANSFORMER RESONANCE\n1) SURGE ARRESTER PROTECTION\nThe most practical protection device against resonance\n(PDAR), which only limits the occurred overvoltage of a\ntransformer, is the use of surge arresters connected in parallel\nto the transformer terminals. Surge arresters are known as\novervoltage protection, developed mainly from Zinc oxide\nmaterial [86]. Nevertheless, it can just chop overvoltage\noccurred by each reason. Moreover, it cannot behave as a\nharmonic filter [12], [87]. Surge arresters are categorized\nbased on the voltage level, particularly between 24-800 kV\n(RMS) [87]. The configuration of the surge arrester is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 16 [88].\n2) SURGE CAPACITOR PROTECTION\nThe solution of transformer resonance through a surge capac-\nitor is very similar to the surge arrester protection. In this\nmethod, a surge capacitor is able to tolerate high dU/dt values\nin parallel with the transformer to suppress the transient\nvoltage of the system as a low-pass filter. In contrast with\nFIGURE 18. Configuration of RC snubber to protect the transformer.\nFIGURE 19. Configuration of ZORC to protect the transformer.\nFIGURE 20. Configuration of the pre-inserted resistor to protect the\ntransformer.\nthe surge arrester, the surge capacitor damps the magnitude of\nhigh-frequency overvoltage and decreases the transient’s har-\nmonic content, which may stimulate transformer inter-disk\nor terminal resonance [89]. Fig. 17 [90] shows an in-market\nsurge capacitor and its configuration to protect the trans-\nformer. The conventional surge capacitors are designed for\na 7.2-36 kV (medium voltage) range, and their capacity is\nbetween 0.05-0.8 µF [90].\n3) R-C SNUBBER\nUsing a shunt R-C circuit as a snubber is a standard method\nto protect transformers from transient and resonance. This\nmethod connects a high-impedance R-C in parallel to the\ntransformer [91]. The operation of R-C acts as a low-pass\nfilter and absorbs the energy of the transient signal in the\nresistor. The voltage range of the conventional R-C snubber\nof the power system is between 7-34.5 kV , and the range of\nthe resistor is 20-500  (300-750 W). Also, the range of the\ncapacitance is 0.08-0.75 µF [92]. Fig. 18 shows a configura-\ntion of RC snubber with a transformer [92].\n4) ZNO-RC PROTECTION\nA modified structure of the R-C snubber has been developed\nas a solution to prevent transformer resonance, known as\n58698 VOLUME 11, 2023\nA. Heidary et al.: Transformer Resonance: Reasons, Modeling Approaches, Solutions\nFIGURE 21. Configuration of FDD to protect the transformer.\nFIGURE 22. Configuration of choke to protect the transformer.\nFIGURE 23. Configuration of solid-state suppressor to protect the\ntransformer.\nZORC. This structure comprises Zinc Oxide (ZnO) surge\narresters, resistors, and capacitors, which are very effective\ndevices for suppressing the transient oscillations and protect-\ning the transformer against resonance. Its operation is very\nsimilar to RC snubber; however, it includes a nonlinear resis-\ntor which can improve the operation of RC snubber [93], [94].\nA conventional ZORC is designed for a 3-40 kV voltage level.\nFig. 19 illustrates a ZORC to protect the transformer [94].\nB. SERIES-CIRCUIT SOLUTION AGAINST TRANSFORMER\nRESONANCE\n1) PRE-INSERTION RESISTOR PROTECTION\nA practical way to mitigate the high rate of transient\nvariations in the power system is by using pre-inserted\nresistors (PIR) before switching [95]. Two types of PIRs\nexist: series switches PIR or parallel switches connection\nPIR. Both can protect the transformer against resonance.\nThis method’s advantage is that it applies to high volt-\nage transformers up to 400 kV , and its challenge is\nvery high power loss during power switching. Also, this\nmethod suppresses only the transients occurred by switch-\ning [96]. Fig. 20 shows the configuration of PIR with a\ntransformer [97].\nTABLE 1. Summary of the transformer resonance review.\n2) FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT PROTECTION DEVICE\nThe series R-L circuit is a recently presented solution for\nprotecting the transformer against transient phenomenon and\nresonance. This circuit can be realized by using ferromagnetic\nshielded wire as a frequency-dependent device (FDD) [98].\nThis device comprises a multilayer wire using both aluminum\nand ferromagnetic material, which are wounded as a reactor\nand connected to input cables of a power substation. FDD\nprovides meager resistance for grid frequency (50 or 60 Hz)\nand imposes high resistance of nearly 200  for frequencies\naround 200 kHz [99]. In [99], it is obtained that FDD protects\nwell from short pulses and has little effect on long pulses.\nThe designed device parameters must be developed or inte-\ngrated with devices like the arrester to protect the transformer\nproperly. The variable resistor of FDD is created based on\nthe skin effect of composite ferromagnetic material [100].\nFig. 21 depicts the equivalent circuit of FDD and in-practice\nconfiguration [99].\n3) CHOKE PROTECTION\nChoke is a series device that protects the medium volt-\nage power transformer against transients and resonance.\nVOLUME 11, 2023 58699\nA. Heidary et al.: Transformer Resonance: Reasons, Modeling Approaches, Solutions\nThe R-L choke model can appropriately mitigate tran-\nsient harmonic content and drastically reduce the trans-\nformer’s resonance overvoltage [16]. In normal operation,\nthe impedance of this component (power network 50/60Hz\nfrequency) is nearly zero. During high-frequency transient,\nthese applications behave as a parallel R-L and suppress\nthe high-frequency oscillation by using the effect of fer-\nromagnetic core [101], [102]. Fig. 22 shows the choke\nconfiguration [11].\n4) POWER ELECTRONIC-BASED PROTECTION\nThe solid-state DC reactor suppressor (DCRS) component\nis normally used to protect transformers against transient\nand transformer resonance. This practical method protects\nthe transformer against nonlinear resonance comprised of a\nsolid-state bridge (including four diodes) and parallel R-L.\nIt can appropriately protect the transformer by suppressing\nnonlinear oscillations of voltage transformer ferroresonance,\nand mitigating harmonic overvoltage on the transformer ter-\nminal [103]. The topology of this power electronic-based\ntransient suppressor device is presented in Fig. 23.\nTABLE 1 summarizes the essential data concerning\nreasons, measurement, and associated protection methods.\nConsidering the transformer resonance issue, it is crucial\nto determine the reason for transformer resonance and then\nprovide an accurate model for the studied transformer. In the\nfinal stage, providing the appropriate compound solution for\nthe resonance occurrence of the studied transformer should\nbe considered.\nBy observing in the summary TABLE 1, it is clear that\nthere is no comprehensive solution to protect transmis-\nsion level transformers against grid transients and resonance\novervoltage.\nConsidering the circumstance, the applicability of the\navailable solution in the next section is briefly studied to\nobtain the next step of the research in this field.\nV. STUDY OF APPLICABLE PROTECTION AGAINST\nTRANSMISSION TRANSFORMER RESONANCE\nThis section provides a brief overview of the limitations of\nthe already used protection methods for the protection of\nhigh-voltage transmission transformers. The evaluation of the\navailable protection solutions at a 200 kV voltage level has\nbeen considered.\nA. PARALLEL PROTECTION METHODS EVALUATION\n1) SURGE ARRESTER\nThis component is connected in parallel with the transformer\nto protect it from overvoltage. There are two operating con-\ncerns: The transformer model is inductive and dependent on\nthe voltage magnitude. An equivalent model of the surge\narrester is illustrated in Fig. 24 [12].\nWhen the transients do not exceed the arrester’s continuous\noperation voltage, the equivalent arrester circuit is a series\nRLC. The circuit depicted in Fig. 25 (a) is a middle-passed\nFIGURE 24. Equivalent circuit of the surge arrester.\nFIGURE 25. Split equivalence circuit of the surge arrester against\ntransient.\nfilter around its resonance frequency. However, the remaining\nfrequency content can cause the transformer’s inter-disk res-\nonance while the transformer’s terminal voltage never expe-\nriences an overvoltage due to the surge arrester suppressing\nthe voltage.\nThe next concern about surge arrester protection is caused\nby high voltage and high-frequency transients. In this case,\nthe surge arrester behaves as an R-L circuit, as shown in\nFig. 25 (b). This circuit can cause an operational delay against\na very fast transient, resulting in transformer resonance before\nthe arrester operates. These two reasons show that surge\narresters cannot provide comprehensive protection for trans-\nformer resonance:\n1) Surge arrester cannot protect transformer against low\nvoltage high-frequency transients.\n2) Operational delay considering its inductive circuit\nagainst high voltage high-frequency transients.\n2) PARALLEL CAPACITIVE PROTECTION\nThe capacitive transformer protection consists of three\ntypes [89], [92], and [93]: surge capacitor, R-C snubber, and\nZORC. Considering the industrial datasheets, to protect a\n200 kV transformer, using 0.1 µF, 200  (for R-C snubber\nand ZORC), and at least 360 kV capacitor (considering that\ntransient impulse adds 50-100 kV to the standard voltage of\nsystem) is needed. Condition from equation (5) proves that\nthe steady-state impedance of the capacitor is much higher\nthan the resistance. Therefore, its effect can be ignored in\ncalculating the reactive power consumption of the protection\nbranch.\nR ≪ 1\n/\nωCs (5)\nIn addition, the nominal voltage of each industrial capaci-\ntor module (existing in the market) is 36 kV , 0.1 µF. Hence,\nto create a 360 kV , a 0.1 µF series-parallel connection of\n100 capacitors is needed. This number is estimated under the\n58700 VOLUME 11, 2023\nA. Heidary et al.: Transformer Resonance: Reasons, Modeling Approaches, Solutions\nFIGURE 26. 2D illustration of choke and FDD.\nassumption of linear voltage distribution. The leakage capac-\nitor affects the high-frequency content if it is not distributed\nlinearly. Thus, the number of capacitors should be higher\nthan 100.\nIn the steady state, the protection capacitor bank will con-\nsume reactive power Q as calculated by:\nQ = ωCsV 2\ns (6)\nWhere ω is the angular frequency of the grid, Cs is the\ncapacity of the surge capacitor, and Vs is grid voltage. For\nthe described example, the value of consumed reactive power\nwill be 1.25 MV AR.\nFurthermore, a higher capacitor number can decline the\ndevice’s reliability. Moreover, the reliability of the capacitor\nbank will decrease considering the grid’s harmonic pollution,\nwhich might increase the consumed reactive power in the\nsteady state even more. Therefore, the surge capacitor for\nhigh-voltage transformer protection is not applicable.\n3) SERIES INDUCTIVE PROTECTION METHOD EVALUATION\nThe FDD and the choke [99], [102] are the two main methods\nfor protecting the transformer from resonance overvoltage.\nThe design relies on the ferromagnetic power conductor.\nHowever, there are some differences between these two\nschemes. Fig. 26 depicts a 2D illustration of FDD and the\nchoke structure cross-section.\nNamely, the choke contains the core isolated from the main\nconductor, whereas, in the FDD, the ferromagnetic shield is\nconnected electrically to the main conductor. Furthermore,\nchoke has a resistive secondary turn, while FDD does not.\nAlso, FDD is built by wounding the extensive length of the\nillustrated cross-section, but choke lengths are very shorter.\nFDD’s ferromagnetic thickness is much smaller than the\nchoke.\nBoth structures modeled as series R-L can protect trans-\nformers against resonance because they do not meet power\ngrid voltage during a steady state. They can filter the har-\nmonic content of transients and protect transformers.\nHowever, the concerns are the deep saturation of the choke\ncore, high power losses, and thermal desaturation of FDD\nduring steady state. This concern can also affect the correct\ntransient operation of these devices. Besides, the wideband\noperation of these series filters needs to increase the induc-\ntance, which causes reactive power loss in the steady state.\nEquations (7) and (8) show that core saturation depends on\ncore cross-section and component inductance. The consumed\nreactive power depends on the inductance value, as seen in\nequation (9). Finally, equation (10) shows that the protection\ncomponent’s imposed impedance should be comparable to\nthe transformer impedance.\nB ≪ B(max) (7)\nL.It\nAcore\n≪ B(max) (8)\nI2\nT ωL ≪ 10kVAR (9)\nZT (min)(f ) < ωT L < ZT (max)(f ) (10)\nHere, B, L, and Acore are the protection component’s mag-\nnetic flux density, inductance, and core cross-section. ZT , and\nIT are the transformer’s impedance and current, and ωT is the\nangular frequency of the transformer’s resonance.\nIt should be mentioned that the consumed active and reac-\ntive power can be reduced using the solid-state DC reactor\nmethod.\nHowever, the positive aspects of the presented inductive\nprotection methods are as follows:\n1) The component is not too bulky,\n2) It does not add any electric elements to the power\nconductor,\n3) It is a reliable component.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThis paper reviews the crucial issue of power transformers’\nresonance, addressing the reasons of transformer resonance\noccurrence, transformer wideband frequency model, and pro-\ntection solution. Eight series and parallel protection strategies\nare reviewed concerning transformer resonance protection.\nHowever, there are limited transformer protection solutions\nfor different inter-disk and terminal resonance frequencies in\nhigh-voltage (transmission voltage level) applications. The\nmain shortcoming is expressed by comparing the most signif-\nicant limitations of the presently used protection devices. The\nnext step of this research field will be the development of a\nprotection device for transmission transformers against tran-\nsient for both inter-disk and terminal resonance overvoltage.\nREFERENCES\n[1] E.
