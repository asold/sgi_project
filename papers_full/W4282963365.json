  "abstract": "This paper evaluates an electronic current transformer’s wideband accuracy in the transformation of distorted current harmonics. The tests were performed in the range of frequencies from 50 Hz to 5 kHz. The utmost importance was dedicated to the transformation of the low-order higher harmonics. The novelty of this paper involves the analysis of the self-generation of the third and fifth higher harmonics caused by the nonlinearity of magnetic core magnetization characteristics. Therefore, what is considered new in this investigation is that this phenomenon has a significant influence on values of current errors and phase displacements despite the presence of the operational amplifiers and the Hall sensors in the output circuits. Another important factor to consider is the influence of the RMS value of the primary current and output load of the ECT on wideband accuracy. To show the backgrounds of the performed laboratory studies, we also discuss the operation principles of the ECTs with closed and open feedback loops. The accuracy of the tested ECT deteriorated—as with the inductive CT—by the self-generation phenomenon. This resulted in rapid changes in the values of current errors and phase displacements determined for the low-order higher harmonics.",
