INTRODUCTION\nTransformers is the core equipment of power system, which\nplays an important role in power generation, transmission,\nsubstation and distribution [1]–[3]. Therefore, the operation\nstatus of transformers directly affects the stability of power\nsystem [4], [5]. Once the transformer breaks down, it will not\nonly destroy the normal operation of power grid and cause\nwidespread power failure, but also cause huge national econ-\nomy losing [6], [7]. Thus, it is vital to monitor the operation\nstatus of power transformer over times.\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Ting Yang.\nMonitoring the degradation of transformer oil can effec-\ntively evaluate the lifetime of power transformer [8]. Thus,\nmonitoring the condition of transformer oil is regarded as\none of the preventive measures and it is very important\nin ensuring the safety of the power transformer [9]. The\ndielectric response of transformer oil is an important indi-\ncator for evaluating oil aging, but dielectric response test\ndata are strongly dependent on status of the insulation in\naddition to variations in test and environmental conditions.\nThus, it is complicated to interpret and analyse the dielectric\nresponse [10]–[12]. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA), which\nhas been the widest applied technique in estimate of faults\n182624 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Yanget al.: Novel Measuring Method of IFT of Transformer Oil Combined PSO Optimized SVM\nin transformers, is based on the different concentrations of\ndifferent gases in the oil to determine the failure in trans-\nformer [13], [14]. Interfacial tension is an important index\nreﬂecting polar contaminants in oil, which can evaluat the\ndegree of oil degradation [15], [16]. Therefore, the interfacial\ntension of transformer oil can be used as an important state\nparameter to judge and evaluate the operation status of power\ntransformer.\nConventionally, the interfacial tension of transformer oil\nis measured using ASTM D971 standard [17]. Gener-\nally, measuring the interfacial tension by the Ring Method\nrequires the sample to be sent to an external laboratory\nand requires professionals to make measurements to avoid\nlarge error [18]. Thus, some scholars have studied another\nmethod to measure the interfacial tension of transformer\noil. Norazhar Abu Bakar et al. predicted IFT by means of\nusing UV-Vis spectroscopy and artiﬁcial neural network [19].\nGodinho et al. in [20] proposed a method based on image\nanalysis and orthogonal experiment to detect the interfacial\ntension of transformer oil. A prediction model of interfacial\ntension of transformer oil, using near infrared, molecular ﬂu-\norescence, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy\nmethods and chemometric multivariate calibration methods\nwas proposed in [21].Transformer oil is a very complex\nmixture in which the presence of polar molecules may cause\nred or blue shifts in the detected spectrum, affecting spec-\ntral intensity and ﬁne structure [22], thereby affecting the\naccuracy of spectral detection techniques for predicting the\ninterfacial tension of transformer oil.\nTherefore, this paper proposes to use multi frequency ultra-\nsonic combined with PSO-SVM to measure the interfacial\ntension of transformer oil. The application of ultrasonic tech-\nnology in liquid quality inspection as early as 1991 where\nNorami et al.[23] analyzed the content of sugar by using the\nvariation of ultrasonic sound velocity in fruit juice and bev-\nerage. Mohanan et al.[24] compared the acoustic impedance\ncurves of different additives in milk, and the results showed\nthat ultrasonic can effectively identify different additives.\nThis work offers a new method to measure interfacial tension\nof real transformer oil samples via multi frequency ultra-\nsonic detection technology combined with PSO-SVM. The\nmulti-frequency ultrasound data was obtained by the exper-\niment was input into the SVM, then the Ring method was\nused to measure the interfacial tension as SVM output. The\nC and g of the SVM was optimized by PSO which improved\nthe prediction accuracy. Finally, a case study of test set was\ncarried out to verify the validity of the proposed empirical\nmodel.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The\nMulti frequency ultrasonic testing system is described in\nSection 2. Experimental method are discussed in Section 3.\nThe SVM and PSO algorithms are represented in Section 4.\nThe simulation and analysis of the prediction model of inter-\nfacial tension are presented in Section 5. Finally, a conclusion\nis provided in Section 6.\nII. MULTI FREQUENCY ULTRASONIC TESTING SYSTEM\nUltrasonic measurements play an important part in var-\nious power transformer condition monitoring applica-\ntions [25]–[27]. The difference in polar molecules in the\ntransformer oil causes different strained condition on the\nmolecules in the thin layer of the liquid surface [28], resulting\nin a difference in the interfacial tension of the transformer\noil. The difference of polar molecules has different acoustic\nattenuation characteristics for ultrasonic waves, so the inter-\nfacial tension of transformer oil can be detected by studying\nthe acoustic attenuation characteristics of multi frequency\nultrasonic detection signals. We made IFT measurements on\nseveral samples of transformer oil, using Multi frequency\nultrasonic in accordance with ASTM E275. Our Multi fre-\nquency ultrasonic experimental setup is shown in Figure 1.\nFIGURE 1. Multi frequency ultrasonic measurement system.\nMulti frequency ultrasound signal in the frequency of\n600kHz-1000kHz and the central resonance frequency was\nabout 750 kHz. The both piezo-ceramic elements create the\ntransceiver unit, and the center frequency is determined by\nthe piezo-ceramic material properties and the thickness of\npiezo-ceramic element. Thus, the center frequency fc can\nbe related to the electromechanical piezo-ceramic parameter\n(Nt ) and the piezo-ceramic elements thickness ( Th) through\nthe following equation: fc =Nt\n/\nTh. The MFU testing system\nchose 20 frequencies, which include the central resonance\nfrequency and the other frequencies were distributed around\nthis value. Multi frequency ultrasound signal travels through\nan optical ﬁber and enters the oil sample, which is placed\nin an aluminum can. When measuring, Tx will emits a set\nof multi frequency ultrasonic signals. The multi frequency\nultrasonic signal received by Rx1 for the ﬁrst time is called\nL1, and the second received signal is called L2. The multi\nfrequency ultrasonic signal received by Rx2 for the ﬁrst\ntime is called L3.The ultrasonic measurement device (Yucoya\nEnergy Safety GmbH, GER) is connected to a computer\nwhich displays and analyzes the spectral response of the oil\nsample. The interfacial tension of the oil sample is related to\nVOLUME 7, 2019 182625\nZ. Yanget al.: Novel Measuring Method of IFT of Transformer Oil Combined PSO Optimized SVM\nthe ultrasonic attenuation response which includes amplitude\nresponse and phase response. The amplitude response and\nphase response can be calculated by the measurement soft-\nware (Yucoya Ultrasound Manager, Yucoya Energy Safety\nGmbH, GER) as follows.\nThe received signals can be written as :\nxi (t)=Aisin (ωit +θi) (1)\nwhere Ai is signal amplitude, θi is signal phase, ωi =2πfi,\nfi is signal frequency and i =1,2,3,..., 20.\nThis signal can be written as :\nxi (t)=Misin (ωit)+Nicos (ωit) (2)\nwhere Mi =Aicos(θi) and Ni =Aisin(θi).\nThe amplitude and phase can be determined as follows :\nAi =\n√\nM2\ni +N2\ni (3)\nθi =arctan\n[Ni\nMi\n]\n+⌈1 −sgn(Mi)⌉π\n2 (4)\nThe amplitude response and phase response, which charac-\nterizes the attenuation characteristics of the test sample, at 20\ndifferent frequencies can be obtained by (3) and (4).\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD\nIFT measurements were made, following the ASTM D971\nring method, on 210 mineral oil samples. To minimize the\nimpact of the temperatures on the measurements, a thermostat\nwater bath was used in multi frequency ultrasonic measure-\nments. Multi frequency ultrasonic measurements were made\nat 27◦C on the same samples. Approximately 500 ml of each\noil sample was then placed in an aluminum can and scanned.\nSamples of oil spectral response measurements are shown in\nFigure 2.\nIt will be observed that, as the frequency falls, the ampli-\ntude response of each sample falls in L1 and L2, and the\nsmaller the interfacial tension, the smaller the amplitude\nchange between the different frequencies. In addition, at the\nsame frequency, the larger the interfacial tension, the larger\nthe amplitude response of the oil sample.\nIV. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELS\nA support vector machine (SVM) model, which is optimized\nby particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, have been\ndeveloped to investigate the correlation between the IFT of an\noil sample and it’s ultrasonic response parameters (amplitude\nand phase).\nA. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE\nSVM is a machine learning technique modelled that devel-\noped from the optimal classiﬁcation plane in the case of\nlinear separability [29], [30]. In order to ensure the robust-\nness, SVM adopts the structural risk minimization principle,\nwhile minimizing the empirical risk and conﬁdence range\nof training samples, and has better generalization perfor-\nmance for small sample cases [31], [32]. Given sample sets\nFIGURE 2. Spectrum response of ultrasonic signal.

Equation (5) represents\nthe optimal decision function f (x).\nf (x)=ωT ϕ(x)+b (5)\nwhere ϕ(x) is a nonlinear mapping function that converts\nthe sample input into a high-dimensional feature space,\n182626 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Yanget al.: Novel Measuring Method of IFT of Transformer Oil Combined PSO Optimized SVM\nωT is the weight vector and b denotes the threshold vector.\nIn order to make the SVM have better sparsity, and introduce\nthe insensitive loss function ε, the obtained insensitive loss\nfunction Lε is:\nLε =|y −f (x)|=\n{\n0 |y −f (x)|≤ε\ny −f (x)−ε |y −f (x)|>0 (6)\nThe essence of SVM is to solve the weight vector ωT and\nthe threshold vector b in (5). Under the condition that ε is\nsatisﬁed, the weight vector ωT must be minimized. Thus,\nby introducing the slack variables ξi and ξ∗\ni , the SVM is\ntransformed into a minimization problem for solving the\nfollowing objective function.\nmin ψ\n(\nw,ξ,ξ ∗)\n=1\n2ωωT +C\n∑l\ni=1 (ξi +ξ∗\ni ) (7)\nwhere C is the penalty function and its constraints is :\n\n\n\nyi −ωT ϕ(xi)−b ≤ε+ξi\nωT ϕ(xi)+b −yi ≤ε+ξ∗\ni\nξi,ξ∗\ni ≥0 i =1,2,..., l\n(8)\nUsing the duality principle and the Lagrangian multiplier\nmethod, the nonlinear regression problem is transformed into\na quadratic programming problem and the dual form of the\noptimization problem is obtained :\n\n\n\nmin [−1\n2\n∑l\ni=1\n∑l\nj=1\n(\nai −a∗\ni\n)(\naj −a∗\nj\n)\nK\n(\nxi,xj\n)\n−ε∑l\ni=1\n(\nai +a∗\ni\n)\n+∑l\ni=1 yi\n(\nai +a∗\ni\n)\n]\nst. ∑l\ni=1\n(\nai −a∗\ni\n)\n=0, 0 ≤ai ≤C, 0 ≤a∗\ni ≤C\n(9)\nwhere ai and a∗\ni are Lagrangian operators, and K\n(\nxi,xj\n)\nis\na valid kernel function. Solve (9), thus obtaining a SVM\nregression model as follows :\nw =\n∑l\ni=1\n(\nai −a∗\ni\n)\nK\n(\nxi,xj\n)\n+b (10)\nKernel function, which play an important part in the study\nof SVMs, decides the nonlinear mapping ability of the model,\nand radial basis function (RBF) is used in this study [28], [29].\nK\n(\nxi,xj\n)\n=exp(−g\nxi −xj\n2) (11)\nwhere g is the important parameter of the kernel function.\nB. PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM\nPSO is a form of evolutionary computation technique orig-\ninally developed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995, the\nmain ideas of PSO originated from the foraging behavior\nof birds [33]. The solution of each optimization problem\nis considered as a particle which has initial velocity, initial\nposition and ﬁtness value that is calculated by ﬁtness func-\ntion [34]. In order to facilitate searching in the optimal solu-\ntion space, the ﬂight direction and distance of each particle\nis dynamically adjusted according to its own velocity, and\nit can remember the optimum location that was searched.\nIn each iteration, particles update their velocity and location\nby comparing ﬁtness value and two extremums (individual\nextremum and global extremum) [35], [36].\nvij (t +1)=ωvij (t)+c1r1j (t)\n[\npij (t)−Xij (t)\n]\n+c2r2j (t)\n[\npgj (t)−Xij (t)\n]\n(12)\nXij (t +1)=Xij (t)+vij (t +1) (13)\nwhere i ( =1,2,..., M) is the i-th particle, j ( =1,2,..., n)\nis the j-th dimension of particle, t is the iterations, ω(<0)\nis the weight factor, vij (t) is the velocity of i-th particle\nin j-th dimension at t-th iteration, c1 and c2 are the accel-\nerated factor, r1j and r2j are two random number in the\nrange of 0-1, pij (t)is the individual extremum, pgj (t)is the\nglobal extremum, Xij (t) is the location of i-th particle in\nj-th dimension at t-th iteration. In this paper, according to [37]\nc1 =c2 =2 and 0 .4 ≤ω≤0.9.\nC. SVM BASED ON PSO\nIn order to solve the problem of SVM nonlinearity and dimen-\nsionality disaster, kernel functions are often used to improve\nthe accuracy of the operation [38]. However, in the past,\nthe selection of nuclear functions was often determined by\nhumans. Excessive subjective factors may cause over-ﬁtting\nor under-learning [39]. In order to improve the accuracy\nof SVM operation, it is necessary to select an optimization\nalgorithm to adjust its internal operation parameters. When\nthe SVM model is established, the PSO algorithm, which is\ncharacterized by the special memory function and dynamic\ntracking global optimization characteristic, is used to globally\noptimize the kernel function and the penalty factor to estab-\nlish the PSO-SVM algorithm. The steps are as follows.\n1) Initialization parameters. Initialize parameters of PSO\nlike c1, c2, initial velocity matrix, the optimal position\nof each individual initial particle and the global optimal\nposition and so on.\n2) Select the ﬁtness function. The ﬁtness function of each\nparticle in the particle swarm is calculated by this func-\ntion. In this paper, The ﬁtness function of the model\nwas described as :\nF(x) =1\nn\n∑n\ni=1 (yi −ˆyi)2 (14)\nwhere yi is predicted value, ˆyi is observed value, i and\nis sample size.\n3) Calculated ﬁtness. The ﬁtness of contemporary parti-\ncles is calculated according to (14)\n4) Update particle state. Update the contemporary parti-\ncles according to the (12) and (13) to get the offspring\nparticles.\n5) The end of the optimization. Repeat steps 3) -4) until\nthe particle ﬁtness function value meeting the require-\nments is obtained, or when the maximum number of\niterations is reached, the iteration is terminated and the\nresult is output.\n6) Model Establishment. Input the obtained optimal\nparameters into the SVM model and train the model\nwith the training set.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 182627\nZ. Yanget al.: Novel Measuring Method of IFT of Transformer Oil Combined PSO Optimized SVM\n7) Forecast the interfacial tension. According to the\nPSO-SVM model, it will accurately forecast the inter-\nfacial tension of transformer oil.\nThe diagram of the SVM-PSO forecasting model is shown\nin Figure 3.\nFIGURE 3. Diagram of the SVM and PSO forecasting model.\nV. SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS\nIn order to make the prediction model of interfacial ten-\nsion of transformer oil more reliable, effective and practical,\nwe adopt experimental sample collected from 200 inservice\ntransformers of various voltage classes and with various times\nin service and 10 new oils, and effectively achieves the pre-\ndiction of the interfacial tension of transformer oil based on\nmulti frequency ultrasonic.\nA. DATA PREPROCESSING\nIn this study, the collected samples were randomly classify\ninto training set and test set. The training set consisted of\na random set of 200 samples in the data set. The test set\nconsisted of the remaining 10 sets of samples in the data\nset, which contained all the attributes except the interfacial\ntension data that the model is supposed to predict. The test\nset was never used for the training of any of the models.\nAs described in Section 3, multi frequency ultrasonic\ndetection data of oil samples is high dimensional data. Aim-\ning at the problem that high dimensional data is easy to cause\ndimensional curse, multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) is used\nin this article to reduce the dimensions of dataset. The dimen-\nsion reduction matrix was obtained by MDS, as described\nbelow [40], [41].\nStep 1:Calculate the distance matrix :\nD =\n\n\nd1,1, d1,2, ..., d1,N\nd2,1, d2,2, ..., d2,N\n. . . .\n. . . .\n. . . .\ndN,1, dN,2, ..., dN,N\n\n\n(15)\nwhere di,j =∑k\nl=1 [xi (l)−xj(l)]2; xi (l)and xj (l)are the l-th\nelements of xi and xj, respectively; xi is a variable of original\nmatrix, i (=1, 2,..., N) is the number of variable.\nStep 2:Calculate the double centering matrix :\nB =−1\n2JDJ (16)\nwhere J =E−1\nN eeT is centering matrix, EN×N is unit matrix\nand e =[1,1,1,..., 1]T is N dimensional vector.\nStep 3:Calculate the low dimensional matrix matrix :\nZ =SV\n1\n2 (17)\nwhere Z is the low dimensional matrix matrix, V is the\nsingular valued diagonal matrix of B, S is the singular value\nvector. In other words, B =SVST .\nFIGURE 4. Dimension reduction by MDS.\nFIGURE 5.

It was observed as\nconspicuous from Figure 4 that the accuracy of the First\neight-dimensional data reached 90%.

The\naccuracy of the ﬁrst 30 dimensional data obtained by PCA\nand MDS can reach 96%, and the accuracy increased with\n182628 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Yanget al.: Novel Measuring Method of IFT of Transformer Oil Combined PSO Optimized SVM\nthe increase in the dimensions. But the performance of MDS\nis better than PCA, namely, when 95% accuracy is required,\nthe low-dimensional matrix obtained by MDS has only 11\ndimensions, while the low-dimensional matrix obtained by\nPCA has 18 dimensions. In this paper, the ﬁrst 11 dimensional\ndata obtained by MDS as the input of model, and the IFT as\nthe output of model.\nB. ALGORITHM VALIDATION\nIn this article, the prediction model of interfacial tension\nwas established and validated in simulation environment of\nMATLAB (2018a). The training set pre-processed in Section\n5.1 was used to train the model, and the pre-processed test\nset was used to test the validity of the model. The prediction\nmodel of interfacial tension was established and trained as\nshown in Section 4. The quality of the solution depends on\nthe ﬁtness of the solution during the pso optimization process.\nFigure 6 shows the ﬁtness curve of PSO ﬁnding the best\nparameters (C, g).\nFIGURE 6.

When the parameters (C, g) take the optimal value,\nits MSE is the smallest, which is 0.05074%.\nIn order to verify the predictive ability of prediction model\nof interfacial tension based on the PSO-SVM, the model was\ncompared with the traditional SVM, the BPNN (Back Prop-\nagation Neural Network) and the PSO-BPNN (Back Prop-\nagation Neural Network with Particle Swarm optimization\nAlgorithm) interfacial tension prediction model.\nFigure 7 shows the prediction accuracy of SVM increases\nwith the increase of sample size, when the sample size\nreached 120, the prediction accuracy of SVM was stable\naround 90%. However, when the sample size reached 80,\nthe prediction accuracy of BPNN was stable around 80%.\nObviously, with the increase of sample size, SVM is more\nadaptable than BPNN.\nFigure 8 evaluates the prediction ability of PSO-SVM from\nthe horizontal comparison, highlighting the superiority of the\nFIGURE 7.

As shown in the Figure 8, the PSO-SVM\nmethod converged in 114-th iterations, the minimum train-\ning error of BPNN and SVM is higher than PSO-BPNN\nand PSO-SVM, and the minimum error of PSO-BPNN and\nPSO-SVM is almost the same. However, the training error\nof PSO-SVM reached minimum error faster than the training\nerror of PSO-BPNN, which thus proved that using PSO-SVM\nmodel to predict the interfacial tension of transformer oil\ncould obviously improve ability. Table 1 shows the con-\nvergence time of four prediction modles. As shown in the\nTable 1, the convergence time of the PSO-SVM is the\nshortest, which is 129.31s. Furthermore, through the evalu-\nation indicators, the error between the true values that were\ndetected by the Ring Method and the prediction values of\nthe four methods can be directly reﬂected. Commonly used\nevaluation indicators have sum of squared error (SSE), mean\nVOLUME 7, 2019 182629\nZ. Yanget al.: Novel Measuring Method of IFT of Transformer Oil Combined PSO Optimized SVM\nTABLE 2.

Prediction errors of IFT.\nAs can be seen from Table 2, Table 3 and Figure 9,\nthe prediction accuracy of the PSO-SVM model is higher\nthan that of the BPNN model, the SVM model and the\nPSO-BPNN model, and the SSE, MSE, MAPE and MSPE\nof the PSO-SVM model are also the smallest of all the mod-\nels established in this paper. The experimental results show\nthat the PSO-SVM model can effectively realize the nonlin-\near mapping relationship between multi frequency ultrasonic\ndata and interfacial tension.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nThis work was carried out to explore the acoustical properties\nof transformer oil using multi frequency ultrasonic detec-\ntion. It focuses on the determination of interfacial tension of\nthe transformer oil using multi frequency ultrasonic. In this\npaper, a multi frequency ultrasonic combined with PSO-SVM\nmethod was presented as the effective alternative of an accu-\nrate tool for interfacial tension prediction. The kernel function\ng and penalty factor C of SVM are optimized by particle\nswarm optimization which is characterized by the special\nmemory function and dynamic tracking global optimization\ncharacteristic, so as to improve the prediction accuracy and\nprecision. The best g =1.356 and C =2.831. The experimental\nresults show that the accuracy rate of this model reached 93%.\nIn this work, the nonlinear relationship between the param-\neters of the transformer oil, which were obtained by multi\nfrequency ultrasonic testing, and the interfacial tension of\nthe oil was effectively realized by the PSO-SVM model. The\ninterface tension of transformer oil prediction method, which\nwas proposed in this work, is very promising in the power\nindustry. It also has the potential to be applied to the detection\nof other parameters.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T. K.
