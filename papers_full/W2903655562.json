The purpose of this present review was to improve the consistency of future \nresearch, by documenting the outcomes reported in recent studies of musicians’ MSS and the \ndata collection tools used. All English language, peer-reviewed studies, published 2007–2016 that \nreported musicians’ self-reported MSS outcomes were identified. Details of the types of outcomes \nreported and the tools used were extracted, and synthesised descriptively. A range of MSS out-\ncomes were reported, including MSS with a temporal relationship to activities performed, and the \nconsequences of symptoms. Only 24% of studies used standardised questionnaires, with the Nordic \nMusculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) being the most commonly used. To improve the homogene-\nity of outcomes and data collection tools when investigating musicians’ MSS, we recommend using \nthe NMQ, where appropriate. Recall periods of 12-months and 7-d are the most appropriate for \nprevalence, and 7-d recall periods for ratings. Importantly, outcomes and the tools used to collect \ndata should be reported in sufficient detail to ensure that the study can be replicated, critiqued, and \naccurately interpreted.\nKey words: Musicians, Outcomes, Measures, Rating scales, Questionnaires, Musculoskeletal, Pain, Review\nBackground\nMusculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) include pain, stiff-\nness, weakness, numbness, and loss of control in soft tis-\nsue, peripheral joints and the axial spine 1, 2). When assess-\ning MSS, there are a number of parameters that need to \nbe considered. These parameters include the MSS quality \n(e.g. pain, tingling), intensity, location, and frequency of \nsymptoms, and temporal relationship of MSS to a particu -\nlar activity, as well as activity and participation limitations \ndue to MSS, and whether MSS are perceived to be due to a \nparticular factor (e.g. resulting from work). The variability \nin the assessment of each of these parameters (e.g. which \nscale was used to measure MSS intensity), the potential \ncombination of parameters, and the recall periods of inter -\nest (e.g. last 12-months, current) result in a seemingly \nendless range of potential outcomes relating to MSS.\nRecent systematic reviews of various occupational \ngroups\n3–7), including musicians8–14), have identified incon-\nsistencies in the case definitions used for MSS, the specific \noutcomes of interest, and the methods of data collection \n(e.g. questionnaires). In the first systematic review\n12) of \nmusicians’ MSS, published in 1998, the authors recom-\nmended that clear case definitions be used and reported, \nand that these allowed for comparison with other studies. \nDespite this recommendation, issues remain\n8–11, 13, 14).\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.\nE-mail: Jessica.stanhope@adelaide.edu.au\n©2019 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health\nIndustrial Health 2019, 57, 454–494 Review Article\nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives (by-nc-nd) License. \n(CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)\nASSESSING MUSICIANS’ MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS 455\nRecently there have been calls for guidelines regarding \nthe data collection tools used to assess musicians’ MSS 14). \nOne of the potential barriers to improving the consistency \nof terminology and case definitions is that there has not \nbeen a comprehensive investigation of the outcomes and \ntools used for studies examining musicians’ MSS. The \npresent review builds on previous systematic reviews \nregarding the prevalence\n8–12) and incidence of11, 12), or risk \nfactors for 8, 13, 14)  MSS in musicians, by looking specifi-\ncally at the types of outcomes reported and the data col-\nlection tools used, rather than focusing on study findings. \nAdditionally, the present review considers types of studies \nwhich have not been addressed in existing reviews (e.g. \ninterventions) and includes a broader range of outcomes \n(e.g. symptom intensity, seeking treatment). In addition, \nwe include all types of musicians, making this review \nthe most comprehensive examination of the topic to date, \nand providing the foundation for the suggested guidelines \nregarding future data collection tools to assess musicians’ \nMSS\n14).\nWe aimed to improve the consistency of research \nregarding musicians’ MSS, by reviewing the reported \noutcomes (e.g. recall periods, severity), and data collection \ntools used (e.g. questionnaires, rating scales). By doing \nso, future research can be designed to ensure that findings \ncan be compared and/or synthesised with the existing \nliterature, thus improving the overall evidence base for \ndeveloping and testing appropriate strategies to reduce the \nburden of MSS for musicians.\nMethods\nA broad systematic search was first performed to \nidentify any studies regarding musicians’ MSS (including \nreviews). Studies were identified through a systematic \nsearch seven library databases, and screening of the table \nof contents and abstracts section of Medical Problems of \nPerforming Artists to identify any studies regarding musi-\ncians’ MSS (Appendix 1). The citation and reference lists \nof musicians’ MSS were screened to identify additional \npotentially relevant studies. From the resultant list of stud-\nies, we included studies reporting self-reported MSS out-\ncomes. Outcomes included, but were not limited to: MSS \nwhich were attributed to or aggravated by specific factors; \nthe consequences of MSS (e.g. sick leave, consulting a \nhealth professional); MSS with a temporal relationship to \nan activity (e.g. MSS while playing); and more general \noutcomes, which were reported as the presence or absence \nof an outcome, and ratings of frequency or intensity. Stud-\nies were only eligible if they were published in English \nlanguage, within peer-reviewed journals from 2007–2016. \nThe first author determined study inclusion and exclusion, \nwith another reviewer consulted where there was any \nuncertainty.\nExtracted data included: the questionnaire(s) and ratings \nscales used (including scale type, rating type, scale length, \nanchors); body charts used; ‘music-related’ MSS terminol-\nogy and definitions; MSS quality, recall-period, location, \nduration, severity, and frequency; MSS with a temporal \nrelationship to activities; MSS resulting from perceived \naggravating or risk factors; and MSS consequences (e.g. \nimpact on playing, management strategies used). Data \nfrom included studies were manually extracted twice \nby one reviewer, and checked by another reviewer, with \ndiscrepancies resolved through discussion with a third \nreviewer, if required. Verification by a second reviewer \nis an accepted approach for systematic reviews\n15), with \nevidence suggesting that review findings do not differ \nwhether there has been double extraction or single extrac -\ntion with verification\n16).\nFollowing the methods used by Smith et al. 17), if the \nquestionnaire was included in the appendix, or a published \nquestionnaire was cited with no mention of any modifica -\ntions having been made, the data extracted were checked \nagainst the questionnaire used, to fill in gaps from the text \nand to identify discrepancies. If the modifications made to \nquestionnaires were described, it was assumed that other \nelements of the questionnaire remained the same and thus \nthese questionnaires were also checked. If papers reported \non the same study, it was assumed the same questionnaire \nwas used.\nData were reported descriptively, and in tabulated form. \nOutcomes were only reported where the recall-periods \nwere clearly stated, as this is integral to defining outcomes. \nThe outcomes were classified as temporal relationship of \nMSS to an activity, MSS with perceived aggravating or \nrisk factors, the consequences of MSS (including manage -\nment strategies), and MSS in general. The latter category \nincluded outcomes where the term music-related or similar \n(e.g. playing-related) was used, but not defined in such a \nway that the relationship between MSS and musical activ -\nity could be determined.\nBecause we were interested in describing the types of \noutcomes and the tools used to collect the data, rather than \nthe findings of the included studies per se, we did not as-\nsess methodological bias, as is typical of reviews of this \nnature (e.g.\n18–26)).\nJ STANHOPE et al.456\nIndustrial Health 2019, 57, 454–494\nResults\nA total of 125 articles met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). \nOf these articles, there were 110 unique studies, with some \narticles reporting on the same dataset27–50). Values reported \nthroughout this review refer to the 110 unique studies, un-\nless otherwise indicated.\nQuestionnaires used\nFew studies (24%) used existing standardised question-\nnaires that have been used with the general population; \nhowever, there appears to be an increase in their usage \nwith 33% of studies published from 2012 onwards us-\ning such questionnaires. The most commonly used \nquestionnaires (including translations) were the Nordic \nMusculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ, also known as the \nStandardised Nordic Questionnaire)\n51), the Disabilities of \nthe Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire 52), \nand the Neck Disability Index 53–55)  (Table 1). Of note, \nwhile there was no mention of modifications to the NMQ \nthere appear to have been some discrepancies in the symp-\ntoms reported\n43, 44, 56, 57), recall periods58, 59), and the body \nregions60) in some studies.\nIn addition to the published modifications of the NMQ \n(Table 1), seven studies reported modifying the NMQ. \nKaufman-Cohen and Ratzon\n75) added additional up-\nFig. 1.

Paarup et \nal.32) did not cite the modified Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire used, but appears to report on the same study33) where the \nquestionnaire was published. cLima et al.85) also referred to it by its former name the Wisconsin’s Pain Inventory.\nJ STANHOPE et al.458\nIndustrial Health 2019, 57, 454–494\nper limb regions, while Leaver et al. 134) added a 4-wk \nrecall period and also added items regarding ‘disabling \npain’, which they defined as “pain in the past 12 months \npresent for at least a month which prevented attendance \nat work for at least 1 d”\n75). Similarly, Kok et al. 79) and \nBruno et al. 135) integrated Zaza et al.’s 2) definition for \nplaying-related musculoskeletal disorders into the NMQ, \nalthough different variations of the definition were used, as \nwill be discussed below. Bruno et al.\n135) also changed the \ntime period to 4-wk, and both studies79, 135) appear to have \nchanged the body regions. Changes made to the NMQ \nwere reported, but not described, in three studies\n32, 136, 137). \nRegarding Paarup et al.’s 32) study, it is possible that the \nchanges to the NMQ were using a rating scale for MSS \nin the last 7-d rather than a dichotomous response, as this \nmodification was published in their other article\n33), which \nappears to report on the same study.\nTo guide the collection of data for specific body regions, \n14 studies reported using a body chart27–30, 33, 35, 38, 39, 43–46, \n56, 66, 68, 74, 80, 89, 131, 138) ; six studies including the body \nchart within the article 33, 80, 89), or the questionnaire in the \nappendix39, 131, 138) . While 11 studies did not specifically \nreport that a body chart was used 31, 32, 34, 36, 37, 57–60, 72, 116, \n118, 124) , they reported using questionnaires that include \nbody charts30, 33, 51, 64, 71, 114, 117, 123). Based on the question-\nnaire 123) used in one study 34–37)  a body chart was only \nused for current pain, with lifetime prevalence determined \nwithout a body chart. Assuming no changes were made \nto the questionnaire body charts, nine studies used blank \nbody charts\n27–29, 34–37, 45, 46, 80, 89, 116, 118, 124, 131, 138) , and 11 \nused body charts with the regions marked 30–33, 38, 39, 43, 44, \n57–60, 66, 68, 72)  (10 of which used the NMQ body chart 33, 43, \n44, 56–60, 66, 68, 72) ). While Bragge et al.’s138) questionnaire \nhad a blank body chart, the body chart reported included \nthe regions marked; hence the reader can ascertain how \nthe authors defined each body region.\nMusic-related terminology\n‘Music-related’ terminology refers to the use of terms \nsuch as ‘playing-related’, ‘performance related’ and ‘as-\nsociated with playing’. There were 53 studies (49%)\n27–31, \n34–39, 43, 45, 46, 49, 50, 57, 60, 75, 77, 79, 80, 89, 91–93, 113, 116, 118, 120, \n121, 124, 125, 127, 128, 133, 135, 136, 138–161)  that used ‘music-\nrelated’ MSS terminology in the title or aim of the study, \nfor inclusion into the study, and/or to describe a MSS out-\ncome. The terms ‘non-playing-related problems’\n147, 162) , \nwork-related 56, 85, 163, 164) , ‘relative to profession’ 70), or \neducation-related165) were also used, and while it could be \nargued that work or education was music-related, because \nthis remained uncertain, these outcomes have not been \nreported further within this section.\nThe specific musical tasks reported were: playing\n27–29, \n38, 39, 43, 45, 46, 49, 50, 57, 60, 75, 79, 80, 91–93, 116, 118, 120, 121, 125, 128, \n135, 136, 138, 142–145, 147, 149–153, 155, 157, 159) , performance30, 31, \n34–37, 77, 127, 133, 140–142, 146, 148, 154, 156, 158, 160) , practice/per-\nformance133), marching 140), drum-corp 140), instrument 135), \nflute148, 150), trombone 89), piano166), and ‘voice usage’ 161). \nTwo studies used the term ‘music-related’ 113, 139) . Some \nterms were used interchangeably 133, 135, 140, 142, 146, 148, 150) , \nalthough in the case of Wood 133) the author made it clear \nthat the term performance-related musculoskeletal disor -\nders included both practice and performance. A further \nstudy124), reported ‘PRMD’ without indicating what this \nstood for, however the questionnaire used 123) indicates \nthat this referred to ‘performance-related musculoskeletal \ndisorders’.\n‘Music-related’ and more generic terminology, e.g. \npain or injuries, appear to have been used interchange-\nably in 25 articles (21 studies)\n34–39, 43, 50, 57, 60, 75, 80, 89, \n118, 121, 124, 136, 138, 140, 142, 146, 150, 151, 161, 166) . How musi-\ncal activity and MSS were related was not clear in 31 \nstudies\n34, 38, 39, 43, 46, 50, 57, 60, 75, 77, 89, 91, 92, 113, 120, 121, 125, \n139–142, 145–151, 157–159, 162) . A total of 17 studies defined \n‘music-related’ MSS as MSS that interfered with musical \nactivity\n27–31, 35–37, 45, 46, 79, 93, 116, 118, 124, 128, 135, 136, 138, 143, \n153, 154, 156, 160)  (all bar one, 143) using Zaza et al.’s2, 167, 168)  \ndefinition of playing-related musculoskeletal disorders \n(“any pain, weakness, numbness, tingling or other physi-\ncal symptoms that interfere with your ability to play your \ninstrument at the level you are accustomed”\n2)) or a slight \nvariation thereof). ‘Music-related’ MSS were also defined \nas MSS attributed to musical activity\n80, 133, 155) , or MSS \nwith a temporal relationship with musical activity 27–29, \n45, 46, 116, 127, 143, 144, 161, 166) , with one additional study 152) \ndefining ‘music-related’ MSS as MSS that were caused \nby or affected performance. One study\n127) stated defining \n‘performance-related musculoskeletal disorders’ according \nto Zaza et al.’s\n2), stating this term referred to “neuromus-\nculoskeletal disorders that develop from playing an instru-\nment, rather than problems that may interfere with play-\ning”\n127), which is in contrast with Zaza et al.’s2) definition. \nThe authors127) later went on to state with regards to data \ncollection that pain while playing was deemed a symptom \nassociated with performance-related musculoskeletal dis-\norders, again citing Zaza et al\n2). This example highlights \nthe need to clearly state the definition used.\nTwo studies27–29, 45, 46, 116) used the term playing-related \nMSS to refer to symptoms that had a temporal relationship \nASSESSING MUSICIANS’ MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS 459\nwith musical activity, and playing-related musculoskeletal \ndisorders to refer to MSS that impaired musical activ-\nity; these were collectively referred to as playing-related \nmusculoskeletal problems. Yoshimura et al.\n143) used the \nterm ‘playing-related pain’ as an over-arching term to \nencompass questions regarding pain when playing, pain \nafter playing, pain that stopped the pianist from playing \nand how much playing was affected.\nSteinmetz et al.\n49) stated that the term ‘playing-related \nmusculoskeletal disorders’ was used as an umbrella term \nencompassing both musculoskeletal pain and disorders, \ncontrasting their definition with that of Zaza et al.\n167), \nsuggesting that within their study 49) playing-related mus-\nculoskeletal disorders simply refer to MSS experienced by \nmusicians. It is possible that this interpretation is also the \ncase in the studies that did not state how musical activity \nand MSS were related, however unlike Steinmetz et al.\n49) \nthe definition was not made clear.\nIn some studies27–29, 35, 36, 43, 45, 46, 57, 60, 80, 124, 161) , where \nthe questionnaire used was reported, we were unable to \nfind corresponding questionnaire items for some or all of \nthe reported ‘music-related’ MSS outcomes, even where \nthe author had indicated the items specifically related to \nthe corresponding outcome\n80). Additionally, two articles43, \n44) reported one study, with many of the same outcomes, \nhowever one reported the same MSS finding as ‘playing-\nrelated’\n43) while the other did not44).\n‘Music-related’ terminology referred to MSS which: \nimpaired musical activity; were attributed to musical \nactivity; and/or had a temporal relationship with musi-\ncal activity; or were not clear in their relationship with \nmusical activity. Notably, not all outcomes where musical \nactivity was in some way related to MSS (e.g. impaired \nmusical activity) used ‘music-related’ terminology, instead \ndescribing the outcome. The outcomes described in the \nfollowing sections relate to the type of outcome reported \n(e.g. temporal relationship between MSS and an activity), \nirrespective of whether the authors of the included studies \nused ‘music-related’ terminology, or not.\nOutcomes reported\nOf the included studies, only 35 had all outcomes \nextracted\n27, 28, 32, 33, 38, 39, 45, 46, 56, 58, 59, 66, 75, 79, 103, 116, 118, \n122, 126, 134, 135, 138–140, 142, 145, 152, 154, 160, 166, 169–175) , 42 had \nsome29, 34–37, 40–44, 49, 50, 57, 60, 68, 70, 72, 74, 77, 80, 83, 89, 91, 93, 94, \n98, 120, 121, 124, 128, 130, 131, 133, 137, 149–151, 153, 159, 177, 178) , and \n44 had no outcomes extracted 30, 31, 47, 48, 85, 87, 90, 92, 101, 107, \n109, 110, 113, 125, 127, 129, 136, 141, 143, 144, 146–148, 155–158, 161–165, \n180–192) as the recall periods could not be determined.\nTemporal relationship to activity\nMSS with a temporal relationship to musical activ-\nity were reported in 10 studies 27–29, 37, 45, 46, 116, 121, 126, \n130, 139, 145, 149, 166) , and non-musical activities in three \nstudies46, 74, 116) (Table 2). A total of 10 of these studies re-\nported MSS during specific activities27–29, 37, 45, 46, 74, 116, 121, \n126, 139, 145, 149, 166) , while others reported MSS before 145), \nor after the activity121, 126, 145), or reported combinations of \nbefore, during and after activity145, 166). Four reports of one \nstudy27–29, 46) indicate that playing-related musculoskeletal \nsymptoms referred to symptoms during and after, while \nanother report of the same study referred to during or after \nplaying\n45). However, the questionnaire114) used only asked \nabout symptoms during playing; hence we have classified \nthe outcome as symptoms during playing only. With the \nexception of two studies\n126, 166) , all reported the percent-\nage of participants who had experienced MSS while doing \nthe specified activity. Three studies\n28, 46, 126)  reported the \nfrequency of MSS 46, 126) , and another 166)  reported the \nintensity of pain, and tension while playing (Table 2).\nIn addition to the abovementioned outcomes, Damian \nand Zalpour94) reported the mean rating from the pain sub-\nscale of the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index 99), which \nincludes items relating to pain during certain activities \ncombined with pain at its worst, which will be reported in \nfull in the other outcomes section.\nSymptoms attributed to an activity\nThe prevalence of MSS aggravated by\n145), or caused \nby35, 36, 121, 133, 138, 178)  various factors were reported in \nsix studies.

In one study 138) the \nparticipants were asked an open-response question, and \nin another 35) participants were asked to rate the effect of \neach factor on an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) \n“no effect at all” to “greatest effect of all”, reporting the \npercentage who endorsed each factor, and the percentage \nwho indicated that the factor was “important”; however \ncut-point for this classification was not reported\n35). In the \nremaining studies, participants appear to have been asked \nto endorse each factor.

Grier \net al. 173) reported an outcome that combined MSS being \nattributed to band activities, and the impact on daily life, \nhence this combined outcome will be reported in detail in \nthe Other Outcomes section.\nConsequences outcomes\nImpact on musical activity\nThe prevalence of MSS that influenced musical activity \nwas reported in 18 studies (Table 4 ). Eight studies\n27–29, \n45, 46, 79, 116, 118, 128, 135, 138, 153)  used Zaza et al.’s 2, 167, 168)  \ndefinition of playing-related musculoskeletal disorders, or \nslight variations thereof.\nIn addition to the outcomes summarised in Table 4, \none study\n153) reported the prevalence of current MSS that \nimpaired playing for periods of >7 d, <4 wk, 4–12 wk, \nand ≥3 months, and another\n138) reporting the prevalence of \nMSS in the last 7-d that impaired playing, for 1–7, 8–30 \nand ≥30 d duration.\nBerque et al.\n118) also reported the percentage of musi-\ncians reporting one, two or three or more body regions af-\nfected by symptoms that impaired playing, during the last \n7-d (reported as ‘current’), and Bruno et al.\n135) reported \nthe percentage of participants who reported MSS that \nimpaired their playing in more than one body region in the \nlast 4-wk. What defined a region was not clear from the \npaper.\nThe lifetime prevalence of self-reported carpal tunnel \nsyndrome, hypermobility, tendinitis, and scoliosis that  \naffected playing were also reported in one study, as well \nas the lifetime prevalence of ‘temporomandibular joint’ \naffecting playing\n151); presumably referring to MSS in this \nregion.\nSix studies used the performing arts module from the \nDisability of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH) ques-\ntionnaire\n52), to provide a measure of musical disability in \nthe last 7-d. Two studies68, 80) reported the percentages for \neach response category (Table 4), while others reported \nthe overall mean\n77, 83) or median score 72), or were unclear \nas to whether the mean, median, or another statistic was \nreported\n79).\nThe Patient Specific Functional Scale 112) was used by \nSteinmetz et al. 91) to collect data regarding the musical \nimpairment from pain. Participants are asked to “rate any \nreduced function due to pain in up to three issues related to \nplaying their instrument”\n91), with these issues nominated \nby the participant. The degree of impairment on the day of \ndata collection was rated on a scale from 0 “unable to per -\nform activity” to 10 “able to perform activity at the same \nlevel as before”\n112). It was not specified whether these \nratings were for the impairment at its worst, on average, or \nits least.\nThe degree or frequency of musical impairment \noutcomes for the remaining four studies are reported in \nTable 5, where three used Zaza et al.’s\n2, 167, 168) definition, \nor a slight variation thereof 153, 154, 160) . Although Árnason \net al.153) reported that the career rating was for the worst \nplaying-related musculoskeletal disorder (using Zaza et \nal.’s\n2, 167, 168)  definition) experienced, they did not specify \nwhether this rating was for the disorder at its worst, on \naverage, or at its least. Similarly, the other studies report-\ning the degree of musical impairment failed to report this \ndetail. Finally, the mean number of days off playing due \nto MSS in the last 12-months was also reported in one \nstudy\n137).\nNon-musical consequences\nThe impact of MSS on daily life was reported in 10 \nunique studies32, 68, 72, 74, 75, 77, 83, 94, 98, 126), five studies32, 35, \n36, 68, 121, 134) reported consequences related to work, seven \nstudies 32, 40, 68, 121, 131, 145, 150)  reported the management \nstrategies used, and one 28) combined impairment of musi-\ncal activity and management strategies used (Table 6). \nFor consequences, the percentage of affected participants \nwere reported, with the exception of two studies\n36, 75) that \nused the number of days off from work as an outcome in \na regression analysis only. For the interference of MSS \non general life, ratings were reported as the mean and/or \nmedian.\nRatings of interference tended to have a 7-d recall pe-\nriod, while the prevalence of MSS consequences was most \ncommonly reported over a 12-month period (Table 6).\nChimenti et al.\n121) also reported the 12-month preva -\nlence of playing-related symptoms that influenced daily \nactivities, as part of a broader scale. Similarly, Grier et \nal.\n173) reported an outcome that combined consequence \non daily life and attribution of MSS to band activities. \nBoth combined outcomes will be reported in the Other \nOutcomes section.\nSymptoms in general\nThis section includes outcomes that did not have a \nASSESSING MUSICIANS’ MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS 463\nTable 4.

It also includes ‘music-related’ MSS \noutcomes, where the relationship between musical activity \nand MSS remained unclear.\nHow common these outcomes are\nThe majority of studies reporting outcomes in this sec-\ntion relate to the prevalence of general MSS\n32–36, 40–44, 49, \n50, 56–60, 66, 68, 72, 75, 83, 103, 124, 134, 135, 139, 140, 142, 145, 150, 151, \n170–172, 176–178). Exceptions were the episodic incidence of \nMSS122), the number of participants who had experienced \nMSS131, 152, 174, 177, 178), or where MSS outcomes were used \nonly to investigate the association with other variables 37). \nOf note, Chimenti et al.’s 121) report of the body regions \nwhere musicians experienced injuries, referred to the per -\ncentage of injuries in those body regions, rather than the \npercentage of affected musicians, while Heredia et al. 152) \nreported the number of musculoskeletal complaints per \nmusician. It is, however, unclear whether this outcome re-\nfers to the body regions affected, the quality of symptoms, \nor a combination.\nMost studies used generic terms, like ‘injury’  or \n‘symptoms’, or had more than three specific symptom \nqualities listed. In a number of studies there appeared to \nbe interchangeable or inconsistent use of terms\n33–36, 43, 56, \n83, 121, 124, 150, 151) , including specific (e.g. pain) and more \ngeneral (e.g. injury) terms 34, 35, 43, 56, 150, 151) ; for these we \nextracted the most general term. When a specific symptom \nquality was considered, the most common was pain, with \ncombinations of pain with ache, discomfort and/or tension \nalso being used commonly (Table 7). Only one of the eight \nstudies\n68) that used the NMQ 51) reported the outcome as \nache, pain or discomfort, as per the original questionnaire, \nwith others reporting pain\n43, 44, 58–60) , pain or ache 56), or \nmore general MSS terms 57, 66) . None of these studies \nreported modifying the NMQ, hence it is unclear whether \nthe questionnaire was changed to reflect these reported \noutcomes, or whether the reporting did not match the data \ncollection. It is therefore possible that additional studies \nreported ache, pain or discomfort outcomes.\nThe most commonly used recall periods were lifetime, \n12-months, 7-d and current (Table 7). A wide range of \nbody areas were investigated, with the most common \nbeing those that match the NMQ\n51) body chart, with the \nlaterality of MSS most commonly reported for the upper \nlimbs (Table 8).\nIn addition to the outcomes reported in Tables 7 and 8, \nthree studies reported the prevalence of MSS of various \ndurations. Ackermann et al.\n34) reported the prevalence of \nthose with current performance-related musculoskeletal \ndisorders (a term used interchangeably with others) \nexperienced for more than one week, and for at least \nthree months. In another report of the same study\n35), the \nprevalence of current pain of <4-wk, 4- to 12-wk and >12-\nwk duration was reported. Paarup et al.\n32) reported the per-\ncentage of participants who had ache, pain or discomfort \nfor more than seven days, and more than 30 d over the last \n12-months, which was reported for the neck, upper back, \nlower back, left and right shoulder, left and right elbow, \nand left and right hand, and these regions combined (i.e. \nspine and upper limb).\nKok et al.\n40) reported the prevalence of current mus-\nTable 5.

For one study 118), \nhowever, adequate details were included within the pub-\nlished questionnaire\n117).\nIn addition to the outcomes reported in Table 9, Kreutz \net al. 172) reported the number of body regions (0, 1, 2, \n…, 10, >10) for which pain ratings of 4–5, then 3–5 were \nmade on a scale from 1 “non existent” to 5 “severe” pain \nin the last 7-d.

These out-\ncomes do not match what was asked in the questionnaire.\nRanelli et al.28) reported a combined outcome, whereby \nthe percentage of those with MSS that impaired their \nplaying, who took medication, and who saw a health pro-\nfessional, during the last month. Similarly, Grier et al.\n172) \ncombined the attribution and consequences, such that their \noutcome was foot MSS within the last 12-months that \nimpacted upon daily activities and that foot MSS was at-\ntributed to band activities.\nThe mean pain sub-scale ratings from the Shoulder Pain \nand Disability Index\n99), was reported by Damian and Zal-\npour94). The measure refers to pain at its worst and during \nspecific activities during the last 7-d with responses given \non 11 point numeric rating scales for each item, from “no \ndifficulty” to “so difficult it requires help”, with an overall \nscore produced\n99).\nOne study 35) reported the lifetime prevalence of MSS \namong participants with a past injury who had recovered \nfrom it, reporting this for whole body, as well as the head/\nface/lips, neck, left and right upper limb, back, jaw, mid \nback, lower back, left and right shoulders, left and right \nelbows, left and right forearms, left and right wrists, left \nand right hands, left and right fingers, left and right hip, \nleft and right knee, and left and right ankle/foot. Another \narticle\n34) from the same project reported this outcome only \nfor the shoulder region, as well as the percentage of those \nwith a history of playing-related injury who had recovered \nfully. These data were collected using a questionnaire de-\nveloped specifically for that project\n123), where participants \nwere asked to rate the amount they had recovered from \ntheir injury on a NRS (0% not recovered at all to 100% \nfully recovered), in 10% increments. Because the time be-\ntween the onset of symptoms, and data collection was not \nconsidered, this outcome is perhaps better described as the \nintensity of symptoms in relation to what they were when \nat their worst. There were inconsistencies in the terminol -\nogy used between these two reports.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first targeted review of the types of outcomes \nreported and data collection tools used in studies of musi-\ncians’ MSS. We built on previous systematic reviews\n8–14), \nthat identified the heterogeneity of outcomes and data \ncollection tools used, but have been limited in their inclu -\nsiveness of musical populations, in the types of studies \n(e.g. prevalence) covered, and in that they have focused \non study findings, rather than an in-depth examination of \noutcomes and data collection tools.\nConsistent with the existing systematic reviews\n8–14) , \nwe found heterogeneity in the types of outcomes reported \nand the data collection tools used, limiting the opportuni-\nties for synthesis of findings or comparison of findings \nacross studies. The most common outcome type was MSS \nin general, following by the musical impact of MSS; \nmost frequently using Zaza et al.’s\n2, 167, 168)  definition of \nplaying-related musculoskeletal disorders or slight varia-\ntions thereof.\nQuestionnaires\nRelatively few studies (24%) used existing, standard-\nized questionnaires that had previously been used with the \ngeneral population. The use of standardized questionnaires \nthat had been used with the general population appears to \nbe increasing, with 33% of studies published 2012–2016 \nusing such questionnaires.\nWhere existing questionnaires were used, the most \ncommonly used was the Nordic Musculoskeletal Ques-\ntionnaire (NMQ)\n51). The NMQ is valid and reliable, in \nits original, translated and extended forms 51, 61, 62, 64, 67) , \nand has been used in studies with a wide range of popula-\ntions\n194), including a national study of workers 195, 196) . \nThus, its use with musicians allows for comparison with \nother groups. The recall periods (7-d and 12-months), and \nthe body regions from the NMQ were also commonly \nused, suggesting that NMQ is an appropriate tool for use \nin most studies, which would improve the consistency of \noutcomes.\nFor functional impairment, the Neck Disability In-\ndex\n53–55) was also commonly used, however as the Index \ndoes not have a clear recall period, we do not recommend \nits use in future studies of musicians’ MSS, unless a recall \nperiod is added.\nOne of the potential reasons for the large number of \nstudies not using existing standardized questionnaires is \nthe interest in music-specific outcomes. The DASH per -\nforming arts/sports module\n52) was an existing measure for \nmusic-specific outcomes relating the upper limb disability \ndue to MSS in the last 7-d. The performing arts module \nhas only recently been investigated in terms of validity\n197). \nASSESSING MUSICIANS’ MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS 475\nWhile the DASH performing arts module was found to \nhave good construct validity, discriminative validity and \ninternal consistency\n197) , only traditional psychometric \nmethods were used. Traditional psychometric methods, \nincluding Cronbach’s alpha, are underpinned by Classical \nTest Theory, and both the Cronbach’s alpha and Classical \nTest Theory have a range of limitations\n198–201) . As with \nany measure where items are combined (e.g. summed, \naveraged), Rasch analysis should be used to examine the \nmeasures’ utility\n202, 203). Further limitations of the DASH \ninclude that it focuses on the upper limb, and that it does \nnot specify whether ratings relate to interference at its \nworst, on average or at its least, which may influence the \nvalidity of the scale. For studies of musicians, it may be \nimportant that the items reflect only musical activity, rath-\ner than “playing your musical instrument or sport”\n52), and \nto make this clear when reporting the study. The DASH \nperforming arts module may be a useful tool for data col-\nlection when investigating musicians’ MSS, however these \nlimitations must be overcome.\nRegarding the prevalence of music-specific outcomes, \nthe approach taken by Kok et al.\n79) and Bruno et al. 135) \nmay provide a valid means of collecting these data, by \nsubstituting Zaza et al.’s\n2) definition for playing-related \nmusculoskeletal disorders, into the NMQ51). An advantage \nof such an approach is that when used with the original \nNMQ\n51) , perhaps with the added regions, researchers \ncan investigate the transition of MSS that do not impair \nmusical activity to MSS which do impair musical activity. \nAs this approach currently only has face validity, future \nresearch should investigate its validity and reliability.\nThere have only been two other questionnaires validated \nfor use with musicians specifically\n117, 119). Both integrated \nmodified items from the DASH 52) sports/performing arts \nmodule, along with either the Brief Pain Inventory 204) \nor Chronic Pain Classification Scale 205) . As with the \nDASH sports/performing arts module, testing of these \nscales\n117, 119) did not use modern psychometric methods, \nlike Rasch analysis, which should be considered in further \ntesting of these scales.\nWe identified a range of discrepancies between reported \noutcomes and the questionnaires used. These may be due \nto inaccurate reporting of the outcomes, or modifications \nbeing made to the questionnaires without acknowledge -\nment and description of these changes. Accurate reporting \nof data collection methods and outcomes is paramount in \nallowing for critique of the methods used, as well as repli -\ncation of, or comparison between, studies.\nMusic-related outcomes\nAlmost half (49%) of the included studies\n27–31, 34–39, 43, \n45, 46, 49, 50, 57, 60, 75, 77, 79, 80, 89, 91–93, 113, 116, 118, 120, 121, 124, 125, \n127, 128, 133, 135, 136, 138–161)  reported on ‘music-related’ out-\ncomes, with the relationship between musical activity and \nMSS being unclear in 58% of these studies 34, 38, 39, 43, 46, 50, \n57, 60, 75, 77, 89, 91, 92, 113, 120, 121, 125, 139–142, 145–151, 157–159, 162) . \nThis lack of clarity is a problem also present in qualitative \nstudies (e.g.\n206–210) ), as well as studies where clinicians \n‘diagnose’ ‘music-related’ MSS without reporting the \ndiagnostic criteria (e.g.\n47, 48, 211)).\nWhere the relationship between musical activity and \nMSS was clearly reported, it referred to MSS which im-\npaired musical activity\n27–31, 35–37, 45, 46, 79, 93, 116, 118, 124, 128, \n135, 136, 138, 143, 153, 154, 156, 160) , with all bar one of the stud-\nies143) using Zaza et al.’s 2, 167, 168)  definition of playing-\nrelated musculoskeletal disorders. We therefore suggest \nthat ‘music-related’ terminology be reserved for MSS that \nimpair musical activity, using Zaza et al.’s\n2, 167, 168) defini-\ntion. As there are some discrepancies in the definitions \nreported by Zaza et al.’s\n2, 167, 168), the definition should still \nbe stated to allow for accurate interpretation of the study \nfindings. Zaza et al.\n2) developed the definition and ques-\ntion regarding ‘playing-related musculoskeletal disorders’ \nthrough focus groups with professional musicians and \nhealth professionals, with the question posed as “do you \nhave pain, weakness, lack of control, numbness, tingling, \nor other symptoms that interfere with your ability to play \nyour instrument at the level you are accustomed to?”\n2) We \nrecommend this question be used in data collection, where \nappropriate. The applicability of Zaza et al.’s\n2) definition \nof ‘playing-related musculoskeletal disorders’ to children \nshould be examined.\nA limitation of the term ‘playing-related musculoskeletal \ndisorder’ and corresponding definition\n2, 167, 168)  is that it \nonly relates to instrumentalists. Hence, where other musi-\ncians (e.g. singers, conductors) are being investigated \nthe term ‘music-related musculoskeletal disorders’ may \nbe more appropriate, and ‘musical activities’  substi-\ntuted for ‘playing’. We would caution against the term \n‘performance-related’ which has been used in a number of \nstudies\n30, 31, 34–37, 77, 124, 127, 133, 140–142, 146, 148, 154, 156, 158, 160), \nbecause it implies the symptoms relate to undertaking a \npublic performance. However, where a definition was pro-\nvided for these studies\n35–37, 124, 127, 133, 154, 156, 160) it referred \nto playing, not performing per se, which may lead to \nconfusion. Similarly, statements such as ‘associated with \nplaying’ which was used in some studies\n121, 145, 155, 157)  \nshould be avoided due to potential confusion with a statis-\nJ STANHOPE et al.476\nIndustrial Health 2019, 57, 454–494\ntical association between playing and MSS179).\nRating scales\nRegarding the rating scales used, only two studies 33, 93) \nreported the measure in sufficient detail to allow for ac-\ncurate interpretation of the findings. The key problems \nwere ambiguity in the types of scales being reported, not \nreporting of the scale length and anchors, as well as not \nreporting the type of rating made (e.g. at its worst, or on \naverage). Such problems are not isolated to this group of \nstudies. Smith et al.\n17) recently reviewed pain intensity \nratings used in studies published in the three main pain \njournals and identified similar issues concerning reporting.\nBoth the V AS and NRS were used frequently, with no \nclear difference between the two regarding improving con-\nsistency. Looking at the broader literature, both the NRS \nand V AS have good reliability and validity\n212), however \nthe 11-point NRS is generally recommended, over the \nVA S\n212, 213) , as it is preferred by both respondents 214, 215) \nand researchers (given it has better compliance than the \nVA S\n212, 213, 215, 216) , and is considered easier to use 212)). \nThe NRS appears to be the most commonly used rating \nscale for pain intensity\n17), and it has also been deemed an \nappropriate measure of pain intensity for children and ado-\nlescents\n217), potentially allowing for comparisons between \nchild and adult musicians’ MSS experiences.\nThe advantage of the NRS is that it is easy to compre -\nhend212), which may be more important in self-adminis-\ntered questionnaires where clarification of the instructions \ncannot be sought. As the V AS requires participants to \nindicate their level of pain on a 100 mm line, resulting in \na 101-point scale, the V AS requires high levels of motor \ncontrol to provide an accurate rating\n212), which may be \nan important consideration when administering to people \nwho may be experiencing upper limb symptoms. The NRS \ndoes not require this level of fine motor control. The NRS \ncan also be completed verbally, allowing for data to be \ncollected over the telephone\n212).\nThe disadvantage of the NRS is that it might not have \nratio properties 212). While it has been argued in the past \nthat the V AS does 212) , recent studies have questioned \nthis 218, 219) . Ordinal data should not be analysed using \nparametric statistics 202), however we identified a number \nof studies68, 72, 74, 77, 83, 93, 94, 98, 118, 130, 160, 171, 177)  analysing \nordinal data using parametric statistics. Ordinal data are \ninappropriate for longitudinal studies (e.g. intervention \nstudies)\n202), however a number of included longitudinal \nstudies reported changes in ordinal data 94, 98, 130, 160) . \nAlthough the NRS appears to be the most appropriate \nmeasure for rating the intensity and frequency of MSS and \ntheir consequences; the accurate and complete reporting \nof the scales and correct selection of statistical methods is \nvital, and for longitudinal studies aggregate scales should \nbe used, so that the data can be transformed into interval \nlevel data, via Rasch analysis.\nFew studies specified the type of intensity rating be-\ning made (e.g. at its worst or on average), which may \ninfluence the validity of the scales; an issue again evident \nin the broader literature\n17). There is evidence to suggest \nthat aggregate measures 212), like those in the Brief Pain \nInventory204), of pain at its worst, on average, at its least, \nand sometimes current pain improve the validity of the \nratings\n220–222) , as was done in two studies 118, 120) . This \napproach has not however been tested using modern psy-\nchometric methods, such as Rasch analysis; hence, it can-\nnot be assumed a valid and reliable measure. Where only \na single item is included, it has been recommended that \nparticipants be asked to rate the intensity of their MSS on \naverage over specific time period\n212), an approach which \nhas been found to be valid 223); however, the implications \nof using ordinal data must be considered. Caution should \nbe exercised when asking participants about their current \npain intensity, as pain intensity is susceptible to diurnal \nvariation, as well as to changes in behaviour (e.g. medica -\ntions, activities\n212, 221, 222) ). As such, these factors should \nbe controlled when current measures as taken. Regardless \nof the scales being used, future studies should refer to the \nrecommendations made by Smith et al.\n17), to ensure that \nthese scales are adequately reported.\nWe found little consistency in the anchors used for pain \nrating scales, which may impact upon findings 224). For \nconsistency, we recommend using “no pain” and “pain as \nbad as you can imagine”, which are the anchors from the \nBrief Pain Inventory\n204), that have been recommended for \nuse to improve consistency for chronic pain trials215).\nBody regions\nRegarding the body regions reported, the regions from \nthe NMQ51) were most frequently reported, and the lateral-\nity of symptoms most commonly investigated in the upper \nlimb, as per the NMQ\n51). As musicians have unique physi-\ncal demands, other regions may be of interest. We have \nseen the diaphragm/abdominal muscle and lip/oral regions \nadded in Engquist et al.’s\n69) modified NMQ, while Kok et \nal.79) added the head and jaw/mouth regions.\nFew studies referred to using body charts, while oth-\ners are likely to have used the body charts from the cited \nquestionnaires. Body charts assist in terms of identifying \nASSESSING MUSICIANS’ MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS 477\nwhat is meant by terms like the ‘arm’  where in some \ncases this appears to be the area between the shoulder and \nwrist, while others may indicate that the arm includes the \nshoulder, wrist and hand. Body charts make this clearer \nboth for the participants, and for the users of the research. \nAgain clear reporting of the body regions, ideally with the \naid of a body chart, is required to allow for synthesis and \ncomparison of findings between studies.\nRecall periods\nThe recall periods used were generally not reported \nclearly enough to allow meaningful data to be extracted. \nA total of 28 studies did not report recall periods for any \noutcome, and 32 did not do so for some outcomes. The \nlack of reporting regarding time periods has been identi -\nfied in reviews of pain outcomes\n17), and broader health \nissues in other groups 225, 226), indicating that this is not an \nissue unique to the research of musicians’ MSS, but rather \na widespread issue which needs addressing.\nThe most commonly used recall periods identified in \nthis review were lifetime, 12-months, 7-d, and current. \nThere were a number of examples of recall periods be -\ning used interchangeably and/or not matching the recall \nperiods used in the questionnaire\n28, 35, 57, 79, 83, 118, 121, 153) . \nOne of the most common problems was with use of the \nterms ‘point prevalence’  or ‘current MSS’  where this \nreferred to recall periods as long as three months\n177) . \nFurthermore, the studies 34–37, 124)  using Ackermann and \nDriscoll’s123) questionnaire have ambiguous estimates of \ncurrent symptoms or the intensity of symptoms because \nthe questionnaire specifies that these outcomes referred to \ncurrent pain/injury as “pain or injury present, or that has \nbeen present for at least the past 7 d”\n123). Reference to this \nstatement was not made in any of these studies 34–37, 124) . \nThe terms current and point prevalence should be reserved \nfor MSS at the time of data collection, consistent with nor-\nmal epidemiological practice\n227). As discussed earlier, data \nregarding current symptoms may be susceptible to diurnal \nvariation and behaviours prior to data collection\n212, 221, 222); \nhence caution must be applied with these measures.\nBoth lifetime and career prevalence may be problematic \ngiven the differences in one’s age or career duration; \nhowever career prevalence highlighted some additional \nconcerns. For instance, Árnason et al.\n153) referred to career \nprevalence, however their population of interest was uni-\nversity students; hence this may indicate university career, \nor perhaps the time from commencing their musical stud-\nies. Regarding the selection of recall periods, it has been \nsuggested that prevalence studies use recall periods of \n12-months or less, to reduce the influence of memory de-\ncay\n21). As the most common recall periods for prevalence \nof MSS were 12-months and 7-d, we suggest these recall \nperiods be used in future studies.\nRegarding the ratings of the intensity of MSS or their \nconsequences, we saw that most studies used 7-d or cur -\nrent ratings. The 7-d recall periods for pain intensity are \nvalid\n223, 228–230)  and reliable 229), and are not considered \ndifficult for most people 228). The 7-d recall period is also \nin keeping with the recommendation that recall periods for \npain intensity ratings be less than 3-months to maintain \nvalidity of the ratings\n212). While current ratings reduce re-\ncall bias, they are also susceptible to diurnal variation 212); \nhence current pain ratings for research purposes may be \ninappropriate. Where these are used, there should be stan-\ndardisation of the data collection methods to minimise the \ninfluence of potential confounders (e.g. time of day).\nFor ratings of MSS consequences, we found the most \ncommonly used recall periods were 7-d. In other popula-\ntions, it has been recommended that recall periods should \nnot exceed one month\n231), with no significant differences \nin 1-, 3–7- and 28-d recall periods for pain interference231). \nConsidering the findings of our review, and the broader lit-\nerature, 7-d recall periods are therefore also recommended \nfor ratings of the consequences of MSS.\nLimitations\nAs outlined above, this is the first review to focus on the \ntypes of MSS outcomes reported in studies of musicians, \nand the data collection methods used, without restricting \nthe review to a type of musician or type of study.\nGiven the broad nature of the review, and to maximise \nthe relevance to future research, we focused on studies \npublished in a 10  year period (2007–2016). While there \nmay be other outcomes or data collection methods used \nin studies prior to 2007, if these have not been used more \nrecently, the inclusion of earlier studies would not have \naltered the recommendations of our review.\nOur review was restricted to studies published in Eng-\nlish language, and we may therefore have missed some \npotentially relevant studies published in other languages; \nhowever, the addition of non-English studies would be \nunlikely to change the findings and recommendations of \nthe present review. As recently discussed by Tsertsvadze et \nal.\n232) excluding non-English studies in reviews does not \ntend alter the findings 233–235), however this may depend \nupon the study topic 234, 236, 237) . It has been suggested \nthat as the proportion of studies published in English in-\ncreases, language biases decrease\n238); hence our review is \nJ STANHOPE et al.478\nIndustrial Health 2019, 57, 454–494\nunlikely to be impacted by such a bias. Further, two recent \nreviews9, 14) of musicians’ musculoskeletal symptoms did \nnot restrict the language of included studies, yet no non-\nEnglish studies were included. Although these reviews\n9, 14) \nconsidered a narrower range of topics and musician types, \nthis finding again indicates that the findings of the present \nreview would not be expected to change.\nThe search, study selection and data extraction were \ncarried out by one reviewer, with uncertainties regarding \nstudy selection checked by a second reviewer and data \nextraction performed twice by one reviewer and checked \nby another reviewer. With a comprehensive search strat-\negy employed, involving searching databases, screening \nthe titles of Medical Problems of Performing Artists, and \nscreening the citation and reference lists of relevant stud-\nies it is unlikely that any relevant studies were missed. \nRegarding data extraction, evidence suggests that review \nfindings do not change whether double extraction or single \nextraction with verification is performed\n16), and the latter \nis therefore deemed an acceptable approach15).\nSummary of recommendations\nOur recommendations regarding MSS assessment for \nmusicians, based on the current evidence for both the \ntypes outcomes and data collection methods used, and on \nthe broader literature around validity and reliability, are \nsummarized in Table 10. Regardless of the MSS assess-\nment tools used, these must be reported in sufficient detail \nto allow for replication (e.g. recall period, body regions, \nquestionnaires used, the type and length of rating scales \nused).\nConclusion\nWe aimed to improve the consistency of reported \noutcomes and tools used in musicians’ MSS research, by \ndocumenting and reviewing parameters from published pa-\npers. Based on the most common outcomes and tools used \nwith musicians, and the broader literature, we developed \nrecommendations, as summarised in Table 10, to improve \nthe consistency of outcomes and data collection tools used \nin future studies of musicians’ MSS. We also identified \nthat there is a need for consistency and clear reporting of \nthe tools used and outcomes reported for musicians’ MSS \nresearch. Opportunities for future research into music-spe-\ncific data collection tools, as well as validation of existing \ntools for use with musicians were identified. By improv-\ning this consistency, as well as developing valid tools of \nmusic-specific MSS outcomes, it is anticipated that the \nquality and consistency of research into musicians’ MSS \nwill improve, along with opportunities for synthesis and \ncomparison of research findings across studies. Strength -\nening the body of evidence around musicians’ MSS should \nlead to improved recommendations for prevention and \nmanagement of MSS for this population.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Maureen Bell (The \nUniversity of Adelaide) for assisting with the development \nof the search strategy.

Search strategy\nDatabase search\nUsing the search terms reported in Appendix Table 1, seven databases (Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Li-\nbrary, EbscoHost Music Index, EbscoHost Health Source: Nursing and Academic Edition, EbscoHost Cumulative Index \nto Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Ovid Embase and Ovid Medline) were searched in January 2017. Where possible \nthe search was limited to English language and the publication dates 2007–2016.\nTitles of articles published in Medical Problems of Performing Artists from 2007–2016 were screened, as well as the \nAbstracts section of the journal. Any titles that reported performing artists or musicians, and health, medical or musculo-\nskeletal conditions were added to the Endnote library.\nWithin the Endnote library, duplicates were removed, before the titles and abstracts were screened. At this stage any \nstudies that were not published in English language, in full text, within peer reviewed journals (according to Ulrich’s Web \nSerial Analysis System), from 2007–2016 were excluded, as were studies where musicians’ musculoskeletal symptoms \n(MSS) were not reported, nor broader terminology (e.g. performing artists’ health problems) which may have included \nmusicians’ MSS. Full texts were then screened using the same criteria, however at this stage they had to clearly report \nmusicians’ MSS. In addition, full text screening excluded studies that only reported symptoms during clinical examina -\ntions (e.g. trigger point pain) or musculoskeletal signs in the absence of symptoms.
