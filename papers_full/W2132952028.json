I NTRODUCTION\nM\nANY investigations of ferroresonance phenomena in\npower and instrument transformers have been per-\nformed, spanning nearly a century of accumulated research [1],\n[2]. Much progress has been made in the modeling and under-\nstanding of single-phase transformer ferroresonance. However,\none of the weakest areas in ferroresonance research remains in\nthe modeling of (a)symmetric three-phase transformers.\nA. Description of Ferroresonance Problem\nFerroresonance is a complex oscillatory interaction of en-\nergy exchanged between nonlinear magnetizing inductances of\nferromagnetic cores and system capacitances (e.g., series com-\npensated lines) [1], [3]. These oscillations manifest as large\ndistorted voltages and currents potentially leading to excessive\nheating and insulation failure in transformers as well as signiﬁ-\ncant disruptions to power networks [4]–[11].\nManuscript received May 19, 2010; revised August 23, 2010; accepted\nOctober 4, 2010.

These modes typically\ncome in four types. The fundamental mode oscillates at the\nsystem frequency f and usually contains harmonics. The sub-\nharmonic mode is periodic and oscillates at1/n multiples of the\nsystem frequency (f/n). Quasi-periodic modes exhibit irregu-\nlar patterns of periodicity due to incommensurable frequencies\nnf1 + mf2, where f1/f2 is irrational with integer n and m.\nThese modes are strictly nonperiodic and produce a discon-\ntinuous frequency spectrum. Chaotic modes exhibit no peri-\nodicity and produce a continuous frequency spectrum resem-\nbling broadband noise. Sudden jumps (bifurcations) to different\nmodes are also possible due to gradual system variations and\nperturbations (e.g., switching transients) [3].\nB. Historical Review of Ferroresonance Research\nFerroresonance research has its origins in ordinary trans-\nformer resonance studies performed as early as 1907 [12]. It\nwas not until 1920 that the vernacular “ferroresonance” was\nﬁrst documented by Boucherot [13] describing the unusual co-\nexisting operating points in a series resistor, nonlinear inductor\nand capacitor circuit. Much early experience in ferroresonance\nwas gained through extensive ﬁeld observations when digital\ncomputer models and analytical methods were in their infancy.\nNotable examples are the studies conducted in [14]–[17] on dis-\ntribution systems exhibiting ferroresonance with voltage regu-\nlation capacitors, and the triggering of ferroresonance in three-\nphase systems from single-pole switching.\nAnalytical approaches based on simple graphical solutions\nwere proposed early on [18], [19] to predict particular bifurca-\ntions in single-phase ferroresonant circuits. It was not until the\nlate 1980s that signiﬁcant breakthroughs were made in nonlinear\ntransformer models and analytical techniques. This was largely\ndriven by advancements in computing power and the founda-\ntion of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory, which Kieny [20]\nand Mork and Stuehm [21] ﬁrst proposed as a suitable frame-\nwork for ferroresonance study. Henceforth, new useful analyti-\ncal approaches have emerged (e.g., bifurcation, phase-plane and\nPoincar´e techniques [22]–[24]) which are now the benchmark\nfor modern ferroresonance analyses.\nToward the end of the 20th century, the study area has\nbranched into four main directions: 1) practical system level case\nstudies [6], [25], [26]; 2) ferroresonance identiﬁcation meth-\nods [27], [28]; 3) development of ferroresonance mitigation\n0885-8969/$26.00 © 2010 IEEE\n582 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, VOL. 26, NO. 2, JUNE 2011\napproaches [29]–[33]; and most prominently, 4) the improve-\nment of analytical techniques and the modeling of electromag-\nnetic transients in transformers, which is the main contribution\nof this paper.\nC. Modeling of Three-Phase Ferroresonance Phenomena\nThere have been very few attempts at studying three-phase\ntransformers under ferroresonance conditions. The work given\nin [34]–[36] implement models considering core topology and\nemploy single-value nonlinear functions for core effects. An-\nalytical and numerical approaches are developed in [37]–[39]\nto calculate ferroresonance modes. However, these approaches\ndo not consider dynamic hysteresis effects with core asymme-\ntry and associated magnetic leg couplings. Furthermore, these\nmodels lack experimental validation.\nD. New Ferroresonance Studies With Hysteretic Core Models\nA new class of transformer models is emerging with the in-\nclusion of hysteresis nonlinearities into core representations.\nRecent studies have shown that accurate representation of fer-\nromagnetic iron-core nonlinearities (e.g., saturation, hysteresis,\nand eddy currents) is important in ferroresonance. Hysteresis\nformation signiﬁcantly impacts the stability domain of ferrores-\nonance, especially for subharmonic and chaotic modes in single-\nphase transformer core models [40], [41]. The common ap-\nproach of approximating core nonlinearities with nonhysteretic\nsingle-value functions (e.g., piece-wise, exponential and poly-\nnomials) has proven to be inadequate for ferroresonance studies\nin single-phase transformers. The impacts of dynamic hystere-\nsis nonlinearities (e.g., major and minor loops) and magnetically\ncoupled asymmetric legs on three-phase transformer ferroreso-\nnance have not been explored.\nFor the ﬁrst time, this paper studies ferroresonance in asym-\nmetric three-phase transformers using a newly developed and\ndetailed nonlinear electromagnetic circuit model for multi-leg\ntransformer cores. The model is implemented in time domain\nand considers core asymmetry and topology, magnetic cou-\nplings of the legs, as well as nonlinearities in the iron-core\nstructure. Accurate dynamic hysteresis nonlinearities including\nmajor and minor loop effects are implemented for each mag-\nnetically coupled core-leg. Experimental validation tests have\nbeen performed to demonstrate the models high accuracy in du-\nplicating ferroresonance behavior in three-phase transformers.\nII. T HREE-PHASE TRANSFORMER MODELING APPROACH\nThere has been signiﬁcant progress in the understanding\nand modeling of single-phase transformer ferroresonance [23],\n[42]–[45]. However, exact behavior of three-phase transformers\nunder ferroresonance conditions is largely unexplored due to the\nlack of adequate core models. These models present signiﬁcant\nchallenges due to the magnetic circuits of different core topolo-\ngies (e.g., three-leg, ﬁve-leg) and associated magnetic couplings\nin the iron-core structure. Moreover, a three-phase transformer\ncore model cannot be simpliﬁed to three single-phase transform-\ners. Each branch of the three- phase core structure has unique\nFig. 1. Asymmetric three-phase three-leg transformer core.\nFig. 2. Three-phase transformer electric equivalent circuit (wye/wye).\nnonlinear leg and yoke reluctance characteristics due to varying\ncore geometries and ﬂux path lengths. This is referred to as an\nasymmetric three-phase transformer which has not been studied\nunder ferroresonance conditions.\nIn this paper, a newly developed three-phase transformer\nmodel [46] is implemented and its performance under ferrores-\nonance conditions is examined. The most signiﬁcant feature of\nthe developed model is the inclusion of detailed hysteresis core\nmodels considering major and minor loop effects combined with\nan asymmetric three-leg electromagnetic structure (see Fig. 1).\nA. Transformer Electromagnetic Circuits\nThe duality principle is applied in the development of coupled\nelectric and magnetic equivalent circuit models where ﬂuxes are\ncomputed as currents, magnetomotive forces (MMFs) as volt-\nages and reluctances as resistances [2], [47]–[49]. The electric\ncircuit represents the ohmic losses in the windings as well as\nleakage ﬂux inductances and eddy-current core losses. The elec-\ntric couplings in the phases due to winding connections (e.g.,\nwye, delta) are accounted for in the electric circuit (see Fig. 2).\nThe magnetic circuit is necessary for modeling the different\ncore topologies, multiple ﬂux paths and corresponding cou-\nplings in the magnetic legs (see Fig. 3). Each magnetic leg\nuses an expanded nonlinear core model to represent dynamic\nhysteresis nonlinearities in each leg. In this way, the hysteresis\nfunctions in each core leg can be individually adjusted to rep-\nresent core asymmetry in the magnetic circuit. The governing\nelectric and magnetic circuit relationships based on Kirchoff’s\nMOSES et al.: IMPACTS OF HYSTERESIS AND MAGNETIC COUPLINGS ON THE STABILITY DOMAIN OF FERRORESONANCE 583\nFig. 3 (a) Three-phase three-leg transformer magnetic equivalent circuit and\n(b) expanded view of hysteresis subcircuit for modeling each core leg.\nvoltage and current laws are\nvp,x (t)= Rp,x ip,x (t)+ Lp,x\ndip,x (t)\ndt + dλp,x (t)\ndt\nvs,x (t)= Rs,x is,x (t)+ Ls,x\ndis,x (t)\ndt + dλs,x (t)\ndt\n(x = a, b, c) (1)\nφa + φb + φc + φ0 =0 (2)\nwhere the respective primary/secondary terminal voltages,\nwinding currents, and ﬂux linkages for each phase x are vp,x ,\nvs,x , ip,x , is,x , λp,x , and λs,x . The primary/secondary phase\nwinding resistances and inductances are Rp,x , Rs,x , Lp,x , and\nLs,x , respectively. The magnetic circuit ﬂuxes in each leg are\nφa, φb, and φc with zero-sequence leakage ﬂux φ0.\nB. Magnetic Hysteresis Core Models\nThe ferroresonance phenomenon is very much dependent on\nthe complex magnetization processes of ferromagnetic iron-core\nstructures. Therefore, accurate core models for true hysteresis\nbehavior including major and minor loop effects are crucial for\nreliable ferroresonance predictions. The approach adopted in\nthis paper is to modify the scalar hysteresis model of [50] and\nintegrate it into the three-leg magnetic circuit.\nIn order to integrate the model into the electromagnetic cir-\ncuit, the original hysteresis functions [50] have been modi-\nﬁed to compute magnetic ﬂux and MMFs instead of B and H\n(e.g., B → φ and H → f)\ndφx\ndt = dfx\ndt\n[\nρx + φ−\nx (fx) − φx\nφ−x (fx) − φ+x (fx)\n( dφ+\nx (fx)\ndfx\n− ρx\n)]\nif dφx\ndt ≥ 0 (3a)\ndφx\ndt = dfx\ndt\n[\nρx + φx − φ+\nx (fx)\nφ−x (fx) − φ+x (fx)\n( dφ−\nx (fx)\ndfx\n− ρx\n)]\nif dφx\ndt < 0( x = a, b, c) . (3b)\nThe major hysteresis loop limiting ascending and descending\ncurve functions, and instantaneous leg ﬂuxes for each phase x\nare φ+\nx (fx), φ−\nx (fx), and φx, respectively, where the leg MMF\npotential is fx. The slope of the fully saturated region along the\nlimiting hysteresis curves is approximated byρx.\nIn order to compute the hysteresis response through (3), the\nascending and descending limiting curves (φ+\nx (fx), φ−\nx (fx))\nmust be determined for the major hysteresis loops in each core\nleg. The following nonlinear function is used for this purpose:\nφ(f)=s g n(f) · α loge (β |f| +1 ) (4)\nwhere αx and βx inﬂuence the vertical and horizontal scaling\nof φ (f), respectively. If (4) is transposed to the right (or left)\nby σx, the limiting ascending (or descending) curve functions\ndeﬁned for the major hysteresis loop are as follows:\nφ+\nx (fx)=s g n(fx − σx) · αx loge (βx |fx − σx| +1 )\nφ−\nx (fx)=s g n(fx + σx) · αx loge (βx |fx + σx| +1 )\n(x = a, b, c) (5)\nTherefore, σx allows the width of the major hysteresis loop\nto be speciﬁed. Furthermore, by separately deﬁning φ+\nx (fx)\nand φ−\nx (fx), nonsymmetrical hysteresis loops can be deﬁned.\nThe advantage of these functions is that only two parameters\n(αx,βx) are required to ﬁt the curve to measured data. How-\never, the curve ﬁtting process must be carefully performed for\nindividual core legs because the strong magnetic leg couplings\ncan increase sensitivity to ﬁtting errors.\nThe required slope functions for (3) are obtained through\ndifferentiation of (5) with respect to MMF (fx)\ndφ±\nx (fx)\ndfx\n= αxβx\nβx |fx ∓ σx| +1 (x = a, b, c) . (6)\nIn this paper, the limiting functionsφ+\nx (fx) and φ−\nx (fx) were\ncurve ﬁtted to measured major hysteresis loops for each core leg\nobtained from the test procedures of [51] (see the Appendix for\nfunction parameters).\nThe modiﬁed hysteresis equations (3)–(6) estimate minor\nhysteresis loops based on domain wall motion theory of fer-\nromagnetic material. The model assumes domain wall motion\ndensities (Barkhausen jumps) vary proportionally to the growth\nor recession of domain regions corresponding to changes in\nﬁeld strength [50]. It is therefore important to note that even\nthough the major hysteresis loop curve functions are estimated\nfrom sinusoidal excitation measurements, the model is capa-\nble of accurately estimating the magnetic response for arbitrary\n584 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, VOL. 26, NO. 2, JUNE 2011\nFig. 4. Ferroresonance in an unloaded transformer fed through series and shunt capacitors (e.g., cable capacitance). The blue lines indicate the fer roresonance\npath when phase b circuit breaker is opened (red).\nnonsinusoidal excitations (e.g., ferroresonance) provided they\nfall within the domain of the major hysteresis loop. This is be-\ncause the hysteresis equations (3) are based on the variation of\nexcitation to compute the variation of ﬂux for estimating minor\nloop formations.\nFinally, the formulated hysteresis functions are realized with\ncurrent sources in the electromagnetic circuit controlled by\n(3) and solved in time domain in PSPICE using the Newton–\nRaphson numerical approach (see Fig. 3). At every time step, an\n“IF statement” selects one of the equations (3) based on the sign\nof the induced voltage or ﬂux derivative, e.g., whether magne-\ntization is increasing or decreasing. The model parameters and\ntransformer data are included in the Appendix.\nIII. F ERRORESONANCE SYSTEM CASE STUDY\nThe ferroresonance study for this paper is performed for an\nunloaded wye/wye three-phase three-leg transformer supplied\nby a three-phase source (see Fig. 4). The transformer primary\nand secondary windings are rated at 440 and 55 V (10 A), re-\nspectively, and operate at a nominal frequency of 50 Hz. The\nferroresonance circuit consists of series and shunt capacitances\ninteracting with the magnetizing inductances of the wound trans-\nformer core legs. The origin of Cshunt and Cseries can typically\nbe from circuit breakers equipped with grading capacitors, shunt\nand series transmission line capacitances (overhead and under-\nground cables), reactive power compensation capacitor banks,\nand lumped stray capacitances in transformer windings, bush-\nings, bus bars, and feeders.\nIn order for ferroresonance to occur, a system perturbation\n(e.g., switching transient) with initial conditions conducive to\nferroresonance is usually necessary. For the studied system,\nphase b circuit breaker is used to impose switching transients\nto initiate ferroresonance. There have been many such practi-\ncal occurrences where unsynchronized three-phase switching or\nsingle-phase circuit breaker operations resulted in one or two\nphases suddenly lost while the transformer is unloaded or lightly\nloaded, giving rise to ferroresonance [3]. For example, feeders\nemploying single-phase circuit breakers or fuses can suddenly\ndevelop faults causing one of the phases to deenergize. The\nswitching transient and resulting unbalanced excitation of the\ntransformer can lead to a ferroresonance path involving magne-\ntizing inductances in series with capacitances. Furthermore, in\nunloaded or lightly loaded systems (e.g., rural distribution feed-\ners), there may be insufﬁcient damping for ferroresonance. The\nresulting large distorted currents and over-voltages can cause\nsevere damage to networks.\nIV . SIMULATION RESULTS\nDetailed time-domain simulation analysis based on the devel-\noped three-phase three-leg transformer model is carried out for\nthe system described in Section III. Simulations are performed in\nPSPICE using the Newton–Raphson numerical algorithm with\na variable time step limited to 50 μs.\nAt the start of each simulation run, the voltage is ramped\nlinearly to its rated value to reach steady-state conditions and\nto avoid transformer inrush effects. Ferroresonance considering\ndifferent combinations of Cseries and Cshunt parameters (see\nFig. 4) with single-phase switching actions are tested. The initial\nconditions of the system must be considered as they highly\ninﬂuence ferroresonance behavior. Unless otherwise stated, the\nreported simulation results maintain the same initial values (e.g.,\npoint-on-wave of ac voltage when the circuit breaker is opened,\nresidual ﬂuxes and capacitance charge). Att = 0 s, the simulated\ncore is assumed to have zero residual ﬂux and all capacitors have\nno initial charge. The initial phase angle between the switch\nopening instant with respect to the phase a voltage peak is\nstated in degrees as ψ.\nFor selected cases, time-domain waveforms of primary volt-\nages and currents including core leg ﬂuxes are computed. Fur-\nthermore, bifurcation diagrams, Poincar´e maps, phase-plane tra-\njectories, and hysteresis formations are plotted to better analyze\nthe complicated stability domain of ferroresonance modes. In\nSection V , experimental tests are performed to verify simulated\nresults and model accuracy.\nA. Bifurcation Analysis\nA useful and effective approach for identifying system pa-\nrameters conducive to ferroresonance is carried out through\nbifurcation analysis. The shunt capacitance is chosen as the bi-\nfurcation parameter and the primary phase voltages are studied.\nTests are repeated for Cshunt ranging from 0.1 to 10 μF under\nMOSES et al.: IMPACTS OF HYSTERESIS AND MAGNETIC COUPLINGS ON THE STABILITY DOMAIN OF FERRORESONANCE 585\nFig. 5. Bifurcation diagram of ferroresonance modes (phase b voltage) for\nﬁxed Cseries (=30 pF) and different Cshunt values.

Note the absence of chaotic\nferroresonance modes and the generation of false period-3 modes in the lower\ndiagram when using single-value (nonhysteretic) core models.\nthe same single-phase fault clearing condition. The bifurcation\ndiagram is constructed from each Cshunt parameter change by\nsampling at the power system frequency (50 Hz) the primary\nvoltage for the open phase b. The transient period is ignored\nin the sampling process to only analyze the subsequent stable\nferroresonance oscillations. Poincar´e maps are constructed in a\nsimilar way by sampling the phase-plane trajectory orbits. The\nresulting patterns can be interpreted for visual classiﬁcation of\nferroresonance modes [22].\nFig. 5 illustrates the existence of multiple ferroresonance\nmodes in the bifurcation diagram based on the developed hys-\nteresis core model. For Cshunt = 0.1 to 0.5 μF, there is a small\njump (bifurcation) in the operating point from normal condi-\ntions to fundamental ferroresonance mode. Fundamental fer-\nroresonance mode is shown in Fig. 6 for Cshunt = 200 pF. The\ncircuit breaker transient is indicated by the large orbit excursions\nwhich eventually settle to a stable attracting limit cycle. The dis-\ntorted noncircular orbit indicates the presence of harmonics in\nthe voltage waveforms.\nFor Cshunt = 3.6 μF, another bifurcation occurs where the\ntransformer enters period-3 type ferroresonance mode as indi-\ncated by the branching into a three line trajectory (see Fig. 5).\nThis mode is stable up to Cshunt = 5.5 μF. Simulated time-\ndomain waveforms and hysteresis formation for this mode are\nshown for Cshunt = 4 μF in Fig. 7. The voltages, ﬂuxes and\ncurrents exhibit highly distorted waveforms reaching in excess\nof 1.2, 2, and 0.4 pu of rated peak values, respectively. The\nphase-plane trajectory of this mode indicates multiple compet-\ning solutions (known as attractors) which inﬂuence the trajectory\norbits to form subharmonic oscillations.\nBeyond Cshunt = 5.5 μF, a bifurcation from period-3 into\nchaotic ferroresonance modes is detected. This is indicated\nby the nonrepeating structure of the bifurcation diagram cor-\nresponding to the sampling of chaotic voltage waveforms. This\nbehavior is due to the existence of a strange attractor in the\nstability domain.\nB. Sensitivity of Ferroresonance to Initial Conditions\nThe previous simulation studies have assumed ﬁxed circuit\nparameters for a varying Cshunt . To illustrate the sensitivity of\nferroresonance to initial conditions, the circuit breaker opening\ninstant for the previous case (see Fig. 7) is now changed to\nψ =6 0◦. The resulting waveforms and phase-plane trajectories\nin Fig. 8 now indicate a momentary ferroresonant oscillation\nwhich loses its stability and dampens out.\nC. Impact of Hysteresis on Three-Phase Three-Leg\nTransformer Ferroresonance\nThe bifurcation diagram of Fig. 5(b) demonstrates the es-\ntimated ferroresonance modes based on a nonhysteretic core\nmodel. A single-value nonlinear saturation curve based on (4)\nwith zero hysteresis width in each core leg is implemented for the\nprevious case study. The predicted stability domain of ferrores-\nonance is signiﬁcantly different when compared to Fig. 5(a).\nThe bifurcation transition into period-3 ferroresonance occurs\nat a lower Cshunt value (3.1 μF) without hysteresis compared to\nCshunt = 3.6 μF with hysteresis, and extends for a wider range\nof capacitance. More importantly, when hysteresis is neglected,\nthe model does not detect the chaotic modes and falsely re-\nplaces them with extended period-3 subharmonic modes. These\nﬁndings are consistent with the single-phase transformer study\nperformed in [41] in which chaotic modes were also misrepre-\nsented in nonhysteretic core models. The bifurcation diagram of\nFig. 5(a) has been conﬁrmed through extensive measurements.\nD. Impact of Magnetic Couplings on Three-Phase\nThree-Leg Transformer Ferroresonance\nIn order to assess the impact of magnetic leg couplings\non three-phase transformer ferroresonance, a transformer bank\n(i.e., three single-phase transformers) was simulated under the\n586 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, VOL. 26, NO. 2, JUNE 2011\nFig. 6.

The corresponding bifurcation\ndiagram is very similar to Fig. 5 (not shown) and similar fer-\nroresonance modes are predicted.

E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND MODEL VALIDATION\nFurther investigations of three-phase transformer ferroreso-\nnance were carried out through experimental tests for the system\nof Fig. 4. The validity of the developed transformer model under\nferroresonance conditions is examined by comparing simula-\ntions of ferroresonance with real measurements obtained from\na dry-type three-leg 440/55-V laboratory test transformer (see\nFig. 15 in the Appendix). The transformer electrical parameters\nhave been determined from three-phase open and short circuit\ntests. The nonlinear asymmetric core magnetizing characteris-\ntics were measured by single-phase sinusoidal excitations of\neach leg. Based on the parameters given in the Appendix, the\ncore models for each magnetic leg closely agree with mea-\nFig. 9.

Measurement Apparatus and Method\nThe three-phase experimental setup (see the Appendix) con-\nsists of an autotransformer source, isolation transformers, three\nsingle-phase circuit breakers for imposing unbalanced switching\ntransients, capacitor banks, and a 440/55-V three-phase three-\nleg transformer. Each circuit breaker has a ﬁxed measured open-\ncircuit capacitance of approximately 30 pF. The switchable ca-\npacitor banks operate in the microfarad range and are connected\nin shunt arrangement, as shown in Fig. 4. Two synchronized\noscilloscopes were setup to capture the transformer primary\nphase-to-neutral voltages and phase winding currents.\n588 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION, VOL. 26, NO. 2, JUNE 2011\nFig. 10. Measured (solid line) versus modeled (dashed line) core magneti-\nzation hysteresis loops (major and minor) for (a) outer and (b) center legs at\ndifferent excitation levels.\nIn order to obtain good comparisons of measured and simu-\nlated waveforms, the initial conditions (i.e., the instant of voltage\nphase angle the circuit breaker operates) at the onset of ferrores-\nonance must be determined precisely. The slightest phase mis-\nmatch can lead to large discrepancies. The two oscilloscopes\nwere triggered simultaneously at the moment of circuit breaker\noperation to capture initial conditions and subsequent ferrores-\nonance oscillations. Measurements of ferroresonance were ob-\ntained with different shunt capacitance values and switching of\nphase b circuit breaker.\nB.

Note that the wave shapes are not identi-\ncal amongst all phases. The wave shape of the faulted phase\nb is markedly different to phases a and c, but is still period-3\nmode. This is because the ferroresonance path of the center leg\nis not identical to the other legs due to the open phase b con-\ndition. The center phase magnetizing inductance has a direct\npath to the shunt capacitance compared to the other two phases\n(see Fig. 4). Furthermore, the core is asymmetric because the\ncenter leg (phase b) has a shorter ﬂux path length. Since phase\nb is open, the voltage is not being supplied by the source, but\nMOSES et al.: IMPACTS OF HYSTERESIS AND MAGNETIC COUPLINGS ON THE STABILITY DOMAIN OF FERRORESONANCE 589\nFig. 13.

It is interesting to note that\nphases a and c exhibit subharmonic ferroresonance oscillations\nwhile phase b waveforms are chaotic. This has not been docu-\nmented in prior studies. This behavior is due to the complicated\nelectromagnetic phase couplings in the core. The developed\ntransformer model accurately duplicates this behavior under the\nsame conditions. Further experimental tests determined more\nchaotic modes for larger Cshunt values.\nFig. 13 depicts the measured and simulated phase volt-\nages and winding currents for Cshunt = 9 μF.

The maximum peak voltage is\napproximately 1.5 pu forCshunt between 8.0 and 9.5μF.

C ONCLUSION\nA new analysis of the stability domain of three-phase trans-\nformer ferroresonance in multi-leg core structures is presented\nin this paper. For the ﬁrst time, a newly developed three-\nleg core model considering dynamic leg hysteresis nonlin-\nearities, core topology and asymmetric leg couplings is ap-\nplied to ferroresonance. Extensive experimental tests of trans-\nformer ferroresonance have been performed to conﬁrm the\naccuracy of model predictions. The main conclusions are as\nfollows.\n1) The study results indicates that the stability domain of fer-\nroresonance modes and amplitude oscillations (e.g., volt-\nage, current and ﬂuxes) are highly dependent on the correct\nmodeling of magnetic couplings and nonlinearities of the\niron-core structure.\n2) Predicted ferroresonance modes (e.g., subharmonic and\nchaotic modes) are shown to be misrepresented in three-\nphase transformer models that neglect hysteresis nonlin-\nearities (e.g., using single-value functions). False ferrores-\nonance modes and the omission of more severe chaotic\nmodes are shown for nonhysteretic core models.\n3) Likewise, the magnetic couplings in the legs are shown to\nsigniﬁcantly impact the accuracy of predicted wave shapes\nand trajectories of ferroresonance oscillations.\n4) For the ﬁrst time, measured and modeled ferroresonance\noscillations are shown to exhibit different behavior in each\nphase. For particular conditions, chaotic voltage wave-\nforms were observed in the open circuited phase and sub-\nharmonic or quasi-periodic modes in the other phases.\nTherefore, extending per-phase modeling approaches and\nanalysis techniques to the study of three-phase trans-\nformer ferroresonance behavior can lead to incorrect\nresults.\n5) The developed three-leg core model correctly predicted\nferroresonance modes observed in laboratory tests. Re-\nsults show that the model duplicates the three-phase termi-\nnal voltage waveforms with high accuracy under transient\nand steady-state ferroresonance conditions.\n6) Moreover, for stable periodic modes (e.g., subharmon-\nics), the model accurately predicted their existence for the\nrange of capacitance values observed experimentally. For\nnonperiodic modes (e.g., quasi-periodic and chaotic), the\nmodel can reproduce waveforms accurately for a few cy-\ncles after the bifurcation point if initial conditions are\nknown precisely. However, due sensitivity of chaos to\nminute differences in initial conditions (e.g., switching\ntransient) and small unaccountable perturbations (e.g.,\nsupply harmonics), incorrect predictions occur for long\nterm behavior under chaotic conditions.\n7) The proposed three-leg transformer modeling approach\nis general and expandable to the study of ferroresonance\nand other transient disturbances in different electrical ma-\nchines, transformer types and conﬁgurations (e.g., ﬁve-\nleg transformers, induction machines, etc.). The model-\ning approach is useful for evaluating transformer stresses\n(e.g., insulation) and testing dynamics of three-leg core\ndesigns.\nAPPENDIX\nMODEL PARAMETERS AND EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nTABLE II\nHYSTERESIS AND MAGNETIC CORE MODEL DATA\nTABLE III\nTRANSFORMER DATA AND ELECTRIC EQUIV ALENTCIRCUIT PARAMETERS\n\nMOSES et al.: IMPACTS OF HYSTERESIS AND MAGNETIC COUPLINGS ON THE STABILITY DOMAIN OF FERRORESONANCE 591\nFig. 15.
