Introduction \n    Thermal error is responsible for as much as 60-70% of the total error in a machine tool \nduring operation. Although part of the thermal error can be reduced through methods such \nas structural improvement or heat-source isolation, their effectiveness is still limited. An \neffective method to address this issue is the adoption of thermal error compensation. The \nmethodology of this scheme aims to perform heat error forecasting for machine tools by \nmeasuring the temperature ascent and thermal deformation in given machining conditions, \nand then applying certain theories and rules to analyze the experimental results, and thereby \npredict the machine’s thermal deformation in processing. Particularly, it is noted that the \nperformance of a thermal error compensation system significantly depends on the thermal \nerror model used. The thermal error model becomes one of the most critical factors in \ncompensating for errors generated in machine tools on account of the temperature ascent of \nthe various machine tool elements.  \n*Received 20 May, 2009 (No. 09-0211) \n[DOI: 10.1299/jamdsm.4.516] \nCopyright © 2010 by JSME \n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n517 \n    Extensive research has been carried out in the past in the area of thermal error \nmodeling )191( − . There are two main research areas related to thermal error modeling. The \nfirst area is numerical analysis techniques such as the finite element method )2)(1(  and finite \ndifference method (3) . These techniques are restricted to a qualitative analysis because the \nboundary conditions and heat transfer characteristics cannot be clearly defined. The second \narea is empirical modeling based on the measurement of thermal deformation and \ntemperature at discrete representative points on the machine tools. Examples include \nengineering judgment (4) , regression analysis (6) , neural network 9)-(7 , grey system \ntheory (13) , fuzzy logic (16) , and adaptive network fuzzy inference system (20) , and a \ncombination of feed-forward neural network and hybrid filter schemes (21) . Further, some \nresearchers (22,23) have remarked upon how the different operating conditions influence the \nbuilding of thermal error compensation systems.  \n    In summary, empirical models have been demonstrated to show satisfactory predictive \naccuracy in many applications even though each method has its own limitations. However, \nsome prime difficulties arise. Most of the proposed thermal-error modeling techniques are \nhighly sophisticated and not easy to understand or apply. In addition, it is very difficult and \nuneconomical to deal with many different machining conditions (including cutting material) \nin modeling, even more so to build a real-time, accurate thermal error model corresponding \nto these machining conditions. Furthermore, there is another important problem requiring \nsolution: A great amount of collected measured data is imperfect, ambiguous, ineffective or \nuseless. Using these data in building a thermal error model may cause serious deviations to \noccur.    \n    This work aims to establish an effective thermal-error modeling technique which \nsatisfies the following requirements: (1) Real cutting conditions should be simple and as \nfew as possible. (2) Measured imperfect and/or ambiguous data should be handled before \nmodeling. (3)The modeling technique should be transparent for easy understanding as well \nas being easily modifiable to adapt to diff erent usage environments. (4) Modeling results \nshould be accurate and meaningful. \n    To address this issue, a data mining based integrated scheme, including K-means (KM) \ntheory, rough set (RS) theory, and linear regression (LR) model, was adopted. This \nintegration scheme is called KRL. The development of our proposed KRL scheme is \nfocused on the techniques of data reduction.  For demonstration, a C-type vertical CNC \nmachining center is chosen as our application target. Through the manipulation of KRL, a \ntransparent, easy-to-understand, easy-to-progr am, easily adaptable, and accurate thermal \nerror model is established. A brief explanation of the theories of KM and RS is presented in \nthe next section before showing the details of the model and its features. \n \n2. Theoretical Bases \nIn order to build an effective thermal error model, three different knowledge discovery \ntechniques are included in our study: the K-means theory, the rough set theory, and the \nlinear regression theory. The KM theory is prim arily used to classify measured temperature \nascents and thermal deformations, to acquire valuable information from these data. The RS \ntheory is used to further handle previously obtained information to obtain the useful \nknowledge elements in order to build a transparent, accurate, and simple thermal error \nmodel. The modeling result expressed in the form of linear regression is essential since it is \ntransparent (easy to understand) to users. Through the LR model, users can quickly perceive \nthe influence weighting of each independent parameter and easily apply this knowledge to \nfurther refine the established models in order to adapt to sophisticated cutting conditions \nduring usage. Following are brief introductions of KM and RS theories. \n \n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n518 \n2.1 K-means theory \nThe KM clustering was brought forward by J. B. McQueen (24) in 1967, which is an \nearly clustering algorithm and a popular method for solving grouping problems. It is easy to \npractice because its concepts are easy to understand. It aims at looking for points \njc (j=1~k), called center or centroid, from d-dimension space ( Rd), and minimizing the \nsquare of the distances of n points ip  ( i=1~n) to its closest centroid (square error), which \nis also called the K-means error.  \nThe KM clustering is one kind of cutting grouping. Since it must calculate the distances \nof every data point and its closest controid in each process bout, the calculation time is in \npositive proportion to the data amount, number of dimensions and number of groups. A \ngood attribute selection institute plays a vitally important role in the quality and efficiency \nof data mining processing and results. \nIt is required to designate the number of group k first, and k≧2. There is a centroid \nrepresenting the group itself, which is also the center of the group. The steps of KM \nclustering are: First, select k items from the data set at random as centroids, then assign each \nitem to its closest centroid according to the Euclid distance between them to form relevant \nclusters. Second, solve for the new centroid of each cluster then allocate each item to its \nclosest, just generated, controid, repeating this step until no item moves from one cluster to \nanother, i.e. the clustering results approach stability (the centroids also). \nFor example, we divide the 21 items in into 3 groups ( k=3), following the above steps, \nand choose 3 items at random as centroids, then assign all items to its closest centroid. The \nformula is \n                       ( 1 )  \n \nwhere: )i(fc  is the centroid of the cluster ip  belongs to.  \nThe basic algorithm is: \nStep 1  Determining the number of cluster you want k (This is a fixed and artificial     \nvalue).  \nStep 2  Generating k centroids at random or by experience ( jc , j=1~k).  \nStep 3  Allocating n points ( ip , i=1~n) to the relative closest centroid. \nStep 4  Averaging the coordinates of all points of each cluster to make its new centroid.  \nStep 5  Adding up the square of the distances of each points and its new centroid, i.e. \nnew k-means error. \nStep 6  Repeating step 3 until satisfying stopping conditions. \nThe complexity of this method exists in Step 3 because the distances of each point and k \ncentroid should be calculated before the closest centroid is determined.  \n \n2.2 Rough set theory \nThe RS theory, first described by Zdzishaw I. Pawlak (25) , is a formal approximation of \na crisp set (i.e., conventional set) in terms of a pair of sets which give the lower and upper \napproximation of the original set. In the standard version of rough set theory, the lower and \nupper approximation sets are crisp, but in other variations, the approximation sets may be \nfuzzy sets. \n \n2.2.1 Definitions \n(1) Information system framework \nLet )A,U(I =  be an information system (attribute-value system), where U is a \nnon-empty set of finite objects (the universe) and A  is a non-empty, finite set of attributes \nsuch that aVU:a →  for every Aa ∈ . aV  is the set of values that attribute a may take. \nWith any AP ⊆ , there is an associated equivalence relation )P(IND : \n            { })y(a)x(a,PaU)y,x()P(IND =∈∀∈=\n2\n               ( 2 )  \nk~)i(f,)cp( )i(f\nn\ni\ni 1\n2\n1\n=−∑\n=\n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n519 \nThe partition of U generated by )P(IND is denoted )P(IND/U  and can be calculated \nas follows: \n{ } }Pa)a(IND/U{)P(IND/U ∈⊗=                   ( 3 )  \nIf )P(IND)y,x( ∈ , then x and y are indiscernible by attributes from P. These \nindistinguishable sets of objects therefore define an equivalence or indiscernibility relation, \nreferred to as the P-indiscernibility relation. The equivalence classes of the \nP-indiscernibility relation are denoted [ ]Px . \n \n(2) Definition of rough set \nLet UX ⊆ be a target set that we wish to represent using attribute subset P; and we \nwish to express this class using the equivalence classes induced by attribute subset P. In \ngeneral, X cannot be expressed exactly, because the set may include and exclude objects \nwhich are indistinguishable on the basis of attributes P. However, the target set  X can be \napproximated using only the information contained within P by constructing the P-lower \nand P-upper approximations of X. \n           [ ]{ }XxxXP P ⊆= ,   []{} 0≠∩= XxxXP P              ( 4 )  \n \n(3) Lower approximation and positive region \nThe P-lower approximation, or positive region, is the union of all equivalence classes \nin [] Px which are contained by the target set of X. The lower approximation is the complete \nset of objects in )P(IND/U  that can be positively (i.e., unambiguously) classified as \nbelonging to target set X. \n \n(4) Upper approximation and negative region \nThe P-upper approximation is the union of all equivalence classes in [ ]Px which have \nnon-empty intersection with the target set. The upper approximation is the complete set of \nobjects in )P(IND/U  that cannot be positively (i.e., unambiguously) classified as \nbelonging to the complement of the target set X . The set XPU −  therefore represents the \nnegative region, containing the set of objects that can be definitely ruled out as members of \nthe target set. \n \n(5) Boundary region \nThe boundary region, given by XPXP − , consists of those objects that can neither be \nruled in nor ruled out as members of the target set X. \n \n(6) The rough set \nThe tuple )XP,XP(  composed of the lower and upper approximation is called a rough \nset; thus, a rough set is composed of two crisp sets, one representing a lower boundary of \nthe target set X, and the other representing an upper boundary of the target set X. The \naccuracy of the rough-set representation of the set X can be given by the following: \n            XP/XP)X(P =α                                ( 5 )  \n(7) Definability \nIn general, the upper and lower approximations are not equal; in such cases, we say that \ntarget set X is indefinable or roughly definable on attribute set P. When the upper and lower \napproximations are equal, XPXP = , then the target set is definable on attribute P.  \n \n(8) Reduct and core \nOften we wonder whether there is a subset of attributes which can, by itself, fully \ncharacterize the knowledge in the database; such an attribute set is called a reduct. Formally, \na reduct is a subset of attributes PRED ⊆  such that: (a) [] [] PRED xx = , that is, the \nequivalence classes induced by the reduced attributes set RED are the same as the \n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n520 \nequivalence class structure induced by the full attribute set P, (b) the attribute set RED is \nminimal, in the sense that [ ] {} [ ]P)aRED( xx ≠−  for any attribute REDa ∈ . \nThe set of attributes which is common to all reducts is called the core: the core is the set \nof attributes which is possessed by every legitimate reduct, and therefore consists of \nattributes which cannot be removed from the information system without causing collapse \nof the equivalence-class structure. The core may be thought of as the set of necessary \nattributes.  \n \n2.2.2 Rule extraction \n(1) Logical representation of decision tables \nConsider an information system: \n)V,QP,U()A,U(I a∪== ,  },O,O{U \"21=                    ( 6 )  \nin which iO means objects under consideration, jP means attributes belonging to iO , \nand Q means decision attribute. This knowledge system initially may be easily expressed in \na tabular form. The table can be transformed into logical form by simply expressing the set \nof objects as the following (example) disjunction, which corresponds to the disjunctive \nnormal form (DNF) of propositional logics. \n\"∨=∧=∧=∨=∧=∧= )]P()P()P[()]P()P()P([ 011121 32321         ( 7 )  \nThe above form can be written much more compactly by the logical formula: \n\"∨∨ )PPP()PPP(\n0\n3\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n3\n2\n2\n1\n1                        ( 8 )  \n(2) Extracting rules \nOur final purpose is to find the minimal set of consistent rules that characterize the \nsystem. For a set of condition attributes { }NP,,P,PP \"21= and a decision attribute Q, PQ ∉  \nthese rules should have the form  \ndc\nk\nb\nj\na\ni QPPP →\"                             ( 9 )  \nwhere { }c,b,a are legitimate values from the domains of their respective attributes. This is a \nform typical of association rules, and the number of items in U that match the \ncondition/antecedent is called the support for the rule. The method for extracting such rules \ngiven in is to form a decision matrix corresponding to each individual value d of decision \nattribute Q. Informally, the decision matrix for value d of decision attribute Q lists all \nattribute–value pairs that differ between objects having Q = d and dQ ≠ . \n \n(3)The decision matrix \nFirst, we look at the case Q = 1, and we separate into objects that have Q = 1 and those \nthat have 1≠Q . The decision matrix for  Q = 1  lists all the differences between the objects \nhaving Q = 1 and those having 1≠Q . \n \n(4) Writing the rules \nNext, from each decision matrix we form a set of Boolean expressions, one expression \nfor each row of the matrix. The items within each cell are aggregated disjunctively, and the \nindividual cells are then aggregated conjunctively. In general, the procedure will be repeated \nfor each possible value of the decision variable. \n \n3. Experiment Design \n3.1 Experiment apparatus \nThe experiment apparatus was composed of a CNC vertical machining center (Model \nVcenter 205, Victor Taichung Machinery) and sensing units. The experimental sensing \napparatus include thermal sensors and a displacement sensor. Semi-conductor type sensors \n(AD590J) were used as thermal sensors to detect temperature variation in the machine \nstructure due to their advantages of fine calibration, high precision, and easy installation. A \n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n521 \n(Nut and lead  \nscrew bearing) \nRenishaw TS27R tool length detection system was used as the displacement sensor for  \ndetecting spindle drift error in the Z-axis direction. In measurement, the standard bar \nquickly moves to the right-up position of the TS27R and then triggers the TS27R probe. \nAfter the initial trigger (with feeding rate 100 mm/min), the original touch position (original \nlength of standard bar) can be detected. For the second and sequential triggers, the feeding \nrate is set at 10 mm/min and the positional changes (due to deformation of standard bar or \nspindle nose) can be detected. The DSP digital signal processor of model \nTMS320C6713DSK was used for data processing because of its simple structure, high \nprocessing speed, easy programming and easy learning curve. The integrated measurement \nsystem of temperature and deformation detection as well as signal processing units is \ndemonstrated in Fig.1.   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n     \n \nFig. 1  Schematic diagram of integrated measurement system \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2   Characteristic points for temperature ascent measurement \n \n3.2 Characteristic points \nIn total ten temperature sensors were stamped at critical points on the machine, which \nare known as important heat generation locations to detect temperature ascents, as \nillustrated in Fig.2. For the X-axis motion, sensor T8 measures temperatures on the nut and \n\n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n522 \nlead screw bearing. For the Y-axis motion, T7 measures temperatures on the nut and lead \nscrew bearing. For the Z-axis motion, there is no sensor placed on the machine structure \nsince major machine parts here all move relatively slowly compared to those parts of the \nX-axis and Y-axis. However, friction effects cannot be ignored since the spindle unit \n(including the drive motor) may generate significant heat because of relative motion. Thus \nwe choose T6, located at the trail of the machine column, to monitor the effect of heat \nformation for the Z-axis motion. For the machine base, T9 measures temperatures on the \nmachine bed. For the most crucial component for heat generation, the spindle unit, we \ninstall five sensors to monitor its temperature at different locations. Among them, sensors \nT1, T2, and T4 read temperatures on the spindle case; sensors T3 and T5 measure \ntemperatures on the front and rear housings of the spindle motor respectively. Finally, \nsensor T10 is placed outside the machine to monitor the environmental temperature \nvariations.  \nIt should be noted that too many characteristic points will cause excessive measurement \ntime as well as a great deal of time for modeling computation. On the other hand, too few \ncharacteristic points will cause the loss of valuable information about thermal errors. Here, \nbased on engineer’s experiences, we carefully choose ten characteristic points in \nconjunction with the adoption of the RS theory, to handle the measured inaccurate, residual, \nor grey data at these points. A proper thermal error model being established in this way is \nmuch more reliable and efficient.   \n \n3.3 Real-cutting experiment \nTo investigate the machinery’s thermal behavior, experiments are performed under \nreal-cutting conditions which are fundamental machining processes for users in work-piece \nmachining. These designed real-cutting conditions are listed in Table 1.  \nTable 1   Real-cutting test conditions. \n   \n4. Modeling and Discussion \n4.1 Thermal behavior of machine tool \nThe temperature ascents at selected critical points on the machine and the thermal drifts \nof the spindle nose in the Z-axis direction were measured simultaneously using the \nintegrated experiment apparatus and test conditions described previously. The measured \nresults of temperature ascent and thermal deformation are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 \nrespectively. Fig. 3 shows that the maximum temperature ascent occurs at the spindle motor \n(T8), reaching nearly 18 C0  after 60 minutes of operation. Fig. 4 shows that maximum \nthermal drift occurs at the spindle nose in the Z-axis direction, which is 83 mµ after 90 \nminutes of operation, and then approximately maintains this value when the machine is in a \nthermally balanced state. \n \n4.2 Knowledge discovery \n4.2.1 Data Classification Using KM Method  \nThere are a total of ten selected critical points for temperature ascent measurements \n(marked as T1~T10) and 90 data were sampled (recorded every minute) at each critical \npoint. At each critical point, we choose 14 observation time scales (every 5 minutes) as \nSpeed \n \nCutting \nDepth \nFeed rate  \n \nCuttingWay \n \nWork Piece \n700(rpm) \n \n3(mm) \n \n1200(mm/min) Zig-Zag  Medium Carbon \nSteel 45C \n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n523 \nsampling bases, marked as X1~X14. First, ten least-square approximate lines of temperature \nascent versus time are obtained using these sampling data. Similarly, one least-square \napproximate line of thermal deformation versus time is obtained using data shown in Fig. 4. \nSecondly, the temperature variation ( refii TTT −=∆ ) is obtained by subtraction of the \nreference temperature refT (temperature ascent on the correlation straight line) from iT  \n(measured temperature ascent). Similarly, the deformation change ( ziδ∆ ), \n2\n)( zizizi δδδ∆ −= , obtained by a square root of the subtraction of reference deformation \nziδ  (average deformation on the correlation straight line) from ziδ (measured thermal \ndeformation), is used as the decision attribute to represent the linearization extent of each \ntemperature ascent.

Using the KM data mining scheme, the value of ziδ∆  (marked as Q and called \nas the decision attribute) may be appropriately classified into two groups, represented as \n“Yes (centered at 4.088),” representing small linearization error, and “No (centered at \n12.28),” representing large linearization error, according to its deviation magnitude. The \nabove results can be found in Table 4.   \nApparently, two kinds of sampling time scales are obtained: \n(1)Good linearization group of time scales: X3, X4, X5, X6, X10, X11, X12. \n(2)Bad linearization group of time scales: X1, X2, X7, X8, X9, X13, X14. \nIf we want to build a linear thermal error model, the data sampled at the time scales of \nthe first group should be considered as the first priority.  \n \nTable 2   Linearization error results at different time scales \n \n \n \n \nTable 3   Range of condition attributes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n525 \nTable 4 Level values of condition and decision attributes at different time scales     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.2.2 Determination of Linear Attributes Combination Using DM \nAccording to the previously mentioned RS theory, we now adopt a simple attribute \ncriterion to form the discernibility matrix (DM), as following: \n \n \n       ( 1 0 )  \n \n \nwhere Q  is the decision attribute and P is the condition attribute. \nUsing the data listed in Table 4, a discernibil ity matrix is established via Eq.(10). The result \nis shown in Table 5. \nIn the discernibility matrix, “OR” operation is applied to each column and the results are \nmanipulated with “AND” operation. The simplest reduced attributes or core attributes can \nbe obtained with further logic operations. If we obtain only one individual attribute, then we \ncan call this attribute “core attribute”, otherwise we call these attributes as “simplest \nreduced attributes.”   \nAccordingly, the discernibility relation of condition attributes can be reduced as  \n(1 0P ) ∨(6 4 PP ∨ ) ∨(8 7321 PPPPP ∧∧∧∧ )             ( 1 1 )  \nEventually, there are a total of ten possible combinations for the above condition attributes: \n(1)P1, P4, P10; (2) P2 , P4 , P10; (3) P3, P4, P10; (4) P4, P7, P10; (5) P4, T8, P10; (6) P1, \nP6, P10; (7) P2, P6, P10; (8) P3, P6, P10; (9) P6, P7, P10; (10) P6, P8, P10. \nIn other words, the resultant discernibility relation can be expressed as  \ndcba\nQPkPjPi →                          ( 1 2 )  \nin which Pi, Pj, Pk may be any one of the above ten combinations a, b, c, and d are “true”; \nand Q means “YES.” \nThere is one question remaining: If we use the above factor combination individually to \nperform its own linear regression model, then which combination can provide the best \np r e d i c t i o n  r e s u l t ?

The \ncalculated result of least square error is shown in Table 6. It is seen that, among ten possible \ncombinations, only the attributes combination P3, P6 , and P10 gives the smallest least \nsquare error (52.6) and the largest correlation coefficient (0.995). Hence, a LR thermal error \nmodel using this factor combination will lead to a better prediction compared to others. This \nLR equation is obtained as \nZδ = −255.57 + 11.91 (T3) − 3.57 (T6) + 1.11 (T10)          ( 1 2 )  \n \nTable 6 Least square error and correlation coefficient of regression results for different \ntemperature ascent combinations \n \n \n \n4.3.2 ANFIS Modeling \nTo understand the effectiveness of our proposed KRL model, a comprehensive artificial \nintelligence mapping scheme: the adaptive fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) (20,27)  scheme \nis introduced for comparison.  \nFrom previous discussions, it is known that T3, T6, and T10 have high linear rankings \n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n527 \neffects on the thermal drift of spindle nose in the Z-axis direction. Therefore, these three \ntemperature ascents are adopted as fuzzy input variables of ANFIS.   \nThrough table investigation method, choosing T3, T6, and T10 as input variables and the \ndisplacement of spindle nose in the Z-axis direction as output variable, the fuzzy rule library \ncan be constructed. The constructed rule library is a 777 ××  three dimensional array \nand in total thirteen rules can be obtained. For all measured data, 70% are used for training \nand 30% are used for checking. In training, a convergent criterion is set as error being less \nthan or equivalent to m. µ20 .  \nThrough a compound learning algorithm (28) , the membership functions describing the \ninput and output variables are modified. After 23 epochs, the convergent condition is \nattained with a maximum error of m. µ1480 . The obtained control parameters of all \nmembership functions before and after training are listed in Table 7. Using the modified \nANFIS model, the maximum checking error is obtained as m. µ1680 . \nTable 7 Membership functions (MF) before and after training \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n5. Model Comparison and Verification (real-cutting test) \nA new run of real-cutting tests is performed to compare the prediction ability of our \nproposed KRL model with ANFIS model and experimental results. The real-cutting \ncondition was set as following: (1) end milling with 6 flutes and an 80 mm (diameter) cutter, \n(2) spindle speed 1000 rpm, (3) feed rate 1000 mm/min, (4) cutting depth 3.5 mm, (5) \nreciprocating ZigZag cutting, and (6)cutting material: medium carbon steel 45C.  \nThe temperature information read by the thermal sensor AD590J was sent to the \ntemperature management program on a personal computer. The compensation value was \ntestified in the cutting experiment for 1.5 hours. The comparison results are shown in Fig. 5. \nIt is seen that thermal deformation of spindle nose in the Z-axis can be effectively reduced \nfrom mµ80  to less than mµ8 . And, the maximum prediction errors for both models are \nless than 5%. This phenomenon indicates that the prediction ability of the KRL scheme is as \ngood as the ANFIS. This feature is very important for engineering application concerns. \n \n \n \n \nJournal of  Advanced Mechanical Design,\nSystems, and   \nManufacturing  \nVol. 4, No. 2, 2010\n528 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 5 Comparison of predictive and experimental results \n6. Conclusions  \nA novel thermal error modeling technique including three knowledge discovery \nmethods: KM, RS, and LR theories (called KRL model) were proposed in this study in \norder to map the temperature ascent against ther mal drift of the machine tool in an accurate \nand economic way. The following conclusions are drawn by this study. \n(1)The proposed KRL modeling scheme has the advantages of providing a transparent, \nsimple and accurate thermal error model using as little measurement data as possible. \n(2)Using the proposed KRL model, the thermal deformation of the spindle nose in the \nZ-axis direction can be compensated from mµ80  to less than mµ8 . \n(3)The KRL model has comprehensive mapping ability and its prediction accuracy is as \ngood as that predicted by the ANFIS scheme. Predictions via the KRL and the ANFIS \nschemes deviates the experimental results (under a new test, real-cutting condition) less \nthan 5%. \n(4)Such a KRL model is especially useful in a production environment in which engineers \nare facing the urgent requirement for a fast, transparent, easily-programmed and \nsimply-installed modeling method. \n(5)Our proposed model uses a C-type CNC machining center as application target. \nHowever, the proposed methodology of KRL model in this study can be applied to any \ntype of CNC machining center with few adjustments needed in the modeling procedures. \nAcknowledgement   \nThe authors would like to thank the National Science Council of the Republic of China, \nTaiwan, for financially supporting this research under Contract No. \nNSC96-2622-E-275-003-CC3. \n \nReferences \n(1) M.
