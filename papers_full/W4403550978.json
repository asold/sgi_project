  "abstract": "Abstract Background Accurate medical coding is essential for clinical and administrative purposes but complicated, time-consuming, and biased. This study compares Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced LLMs to provider-assigned codes in producing ICD-10-CM codes from emergency department (ED) clinical records. Methods Retrospective cohort study using 500 ED visits randomly selected from the Mount Sinai Health System between January and April 2024. The RAG system integrated past 1,038,066 ED visits data (2021-2023) into the LLMs’ predictions to improve coding accuracy. Nine commercial and open-source LLMs were evaluated. The primary outcome was a head-to-head comparison of the ICD-10-CM codes generated by the RAG-enhanced LLMs and those assigned by the original providers. A panel of four physicians and two LLMs blindly reviewed the codes, comparing the RAG-enhanced LLM and provider-assigned codes on accuracy and specificity. Findings RAG-enhanced LLMs demonstrated superior performance to provider coders in both the accuracy and specificity of code assignments. In a targeted evaluation of 200 cases where discrepancies existed between GPT-4 and provider-assigned codes, human reviewers favored GPT-4 for accuracy in 447 instances, compared to 277 instances where providers’ codes were preferred (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, GPT-4 was selected for its superior specificity in 509 cases, whereas human coders were preferred in only 181 cases (p&lt;0.001). Smaller open-access models, such as Llama-3.1-70B, also demonstrated substantial scalability when enhanced with RAG, with 218 instances of accuracy preference compared to 90 for providers’ codes. Furthermore, across all models, the exact match rate between LLM-generated and provider-assigned codes significantly improved following RAG integration, with Qwen-2-7B increasing from 0.8% to 17.6% and Gemma-2-9b-it improving from 7.2% to 26.4%. Interpretation RAG-enhanced LLMs improve medical coding accuracy in EDs, suggesting clinical workflow applications. These findings show that generative AI can improve clinical outcomes and reduce administrative burdens.

Twitter Summary A study showed AI models with retrieval-augmented generation outperformed human doctors in ED diagnostic coding accuracy and specificity. Even smaller AI models perform favorably when using RAG. This suggests potential for reducing administrative burden in healthcare, improving coding efficiency, and enhancing clinical documentation.",
