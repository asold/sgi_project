Gemelli, 8, Rome, Italy\n2946 Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology (2024) 262:2945–2959\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) natural language processing has \nwitnessed a significant transformation with the advent of \nadvanced large language models (LLMs) [1 ]. Two of the \nmost important LLM models are Chat Generative Pretrained \nTransformer (ChatGPT, created by OpenAI, San Francisco, \nCA, USA) and Google Gemini (formerly Google Bard, \nGoogle, Mountain View, CA). Recently, the role of these \nmodels in medical settings has been explored [2].\nIn the ophthalmological panorama, ChatGPT has shown \ngood results in comprehending clinical information and gen-\nerating appropriate replies [3, 4]. ChatGPT models are trained \non a textual database and are able to produce responses that \nare both coherent and contextually appropriate, based on the \nabstract relationship between words (tokens) within the neural \nnetwork [1]. The capabilities of this LLM in answering to mul-\ntiple-choice questions from the US Medical Licensing Exami-\nnation (USMLE) were studied, and it was shown that ChatGPT \nnot only answered properly to more than half of the questions, \nbut also supplied good supporting justifications for the chosen \noptions [5]. Additional features and restrictions of ChatGPT in \nophthalmology have been discussed in literature [6].\nOn March 21, 2023, Google debuted its AI chatbot, Google \nBard, an AI chatbot, which uses machine learning and natural \nlanguage processing to simulate human-like dialogue. Bard can \nbe accessible on several digital platforms, providing accurate \nanswers and assistance in fields such as public health and disas-\nter relief [7]. In the recent months, some research compared the \nperformance of Google Bard to those of ChatGPT in other medi-\ncine subspecialties, such as neurology, neurosurgery, or emer-\ngency [8–10]. Recently, on February 8, 2024, Google presented \nthe update to a new AI-based platform, called Gemini, embrac-\ning optimized features and enhancing multimodal analysis [11].\nIn a glaucoma setting, several research showed the efficacy \nof AI models [12–14]. Globally, glaucoma is a prevalent cause \nof permanent blindness, with a unique modifiable risk factor: \nintraocular pressure (IOP) [15–17]. Current treatment options \ninclude pharmacologic topical therapies reducing aqueous \nhumor production or increasing its outflow, lasers targeting the \ntrabecular meshwork and ciliary body, and surgical treatment \n[18]. The latter includes a variety of techniques, starting from \nthe gold standard trabeculectomy to the newly developed micro-\ninvasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS) and, in more challenging \ncases, glaucoma draining devices (GDDs). A tailored approach \nto surgery, including the search for risk factors for surgical fail-\nure, is now required to ensure a long-term IOP control. In order \nto use the optimum approach, certain risk variables, including \nage, race, conjunctival status, and past medical or surgical pro-\ncedures, must be addressed specifically for each patient [19].\nThe aim of this study was to define the capability of two \ndifferent LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5 and Google Gemini) in analyz-\ning detailed case descriptions in a glaucoma setting and sug-\ngesting the best possible surgical choice. In order to evaluate \nthe accuracy of the two chatbots, the answers were compared \nto glaucoma specialists’ responses and the level of agreement \nbetween them was assessed.\nMaterials and methods\nCase collection\nWe conducted a retrospective review of the files of glau-\ncomatous patients who underwent any type of surgical or \nKey messages\nWhat is known:\nArti/f_icial Intelligence-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini, have been heralded as revolutionary\nturning points in the current AI revolution and tested in other medicine subspecialties, such as neurology, \nneurosurgery or emergency.\nWhat is new:\nChatGPT showed promising results in the analysis of glaucoma clinical cases, being able to produce a coherent\nsurgical plan in the majority of cases.\nGoogle Gemini showed high rates of unprecise and missed answers, along with less detailed and more synthetic\nanalysis of clinical scenarios.\nIn complicated scenarios, the dif/f_iculty in computing heterogeneous conditions emerge, but ChatGPT was able to\nprovide accurate and complete answers, demonstrating multimodal reasoning skills and signi/f_icantly outperforming\nGoogle Gemini.\n2947Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology (2024) 262:2945–2959 \npara-surgical glaucoma treatment in Policlinico Univer -\nsitario Agostino Gemelli between May 2019 and October \n2023. This study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration \nof Helsinki, and the Institutional review board (IRB) \napproval was obtained from the Policlinico Universitario \nAgostino Gemelli Institutional Ethics Committee.\nWe selected a total of 66 medical records from a pool \nof over 250. Patient demographics and medical or ocular \nanamnesis, actual ocular diseases and topical medica -\ntion, referred symptoms, and examination results were all \ndescribed in detail in each instance. Finally, this informa -\ntion was summarized in a complete case description and \nsubmitted at the same time to the ChatGPT and Google \nGemini interfaces.\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma, normal-tension glau -\ncoma, primary angle-closure glaucoma, pseudoexfoliation \nglaucoma, pigment dispersion glaucoma, glaucomatocy -\nclitic crisis glaucoma, aphakic glaucoma, neovascular \nglaucoma, and uveitic glaucoma were among the pheno-\ntypes represented.\nSuccessively, we separated the mentioned instances into \ntwo categories one by one:\n1. “Ordinary” scenarios (n = 42): patients who had no pre-\nvious eye surgery other than cataract surgery and no \nsevere concurrent illnesses or ocular disorders. Only \ntopical medication and/or prior laser treatments were \nused to control IOP.\n2. “Challenging” scenarios (n  = 24): individuals with a \nconsiderably more complicated medical history, includ-\ning past ocular operations such as unsuccessful glau-\ncoma procedures, vitreoretinal surgeries, anterior seg-\nment surgeries, or other ocular diseases influencing the \neye’s homeostasis. Furthermore, instances with concur-\nrent systemic illnesses that may have influenced surgical \ndecisions were included in this sample.\nChatGPT\nBuilt on the “gpt-3.5-turbo” model from the GPT-3.5 \nseries, ChatGPT (OpenAI, https:// chat. openai. com/) is \nan optimized LLM. Up to September 2021, billions of \ntext data taken from online articles were used to train \nGenerative Pretrained Transformer 3 [1 ]. The model is \ntrained to minimize the difference between the predicted \nand actual words in the training data set. After the model \nis trained, fresh text may be produced by giving it an \ninstruction and letting it guess what word will come next. \nThe process is then repeated until the model generates a \nwhole sentence or paragraph, using the predicted word as \nthe background for the next prediction [20]. In compari-\nson to its predecessor, the most recent version, GPT-4, \nwas recognized for having more accuracy and efficiency. \nThe main breakthroughs were increased knowledge base, \nbetter language proficiency, and better contextual com-\nprehension [21].\nGoogle Gemini AI\nGoogle Bard AI (Google, https:// bard. google. com/ chat/) \nis built on the Pathways Language Model 2 (PaLM 2), a \nmassive language model designed to be very effective at \nunderstanding facts, logical thinking, and arithmetic [22]. \nIt is able to respond to a broad range of user queries and \nprompts by simulating human-like interactions, providing \nalso thorough and educational answers to user inputs after \nbeing trained on a large corpus of text data [22]. Due to its \nintegration with Google’s vast search network, Bard AI has \naccess to up-to-date online data [23].\nGemini 1.0 is a new AI model built in three various sizes \n(Ultra, Pro, and Nano); a result of extensive collaborative \nefforts of the Google Team, was announced by the Google \nTeam on December 6, 2023, marking a major platform \nupgrade. With plans to soon include multimodal reasoning \nskills, Gemini Pro (Google, https:// gemini. google. com/ app/) \nis the first model that is now available and can respond to \ntext-based cues [24].\nAlthough Gemini and ChatGPT are comparable in several \nways, Gemini has a remarkable aptitude for comprehend -\ning and responding to inquiries that need for exact details, \nwhile, on the other hand, ChatGPT may effectively produce \na wide range of imaginative and varied texts, including arti-\ncles, scripts, code, and more, all of which may or may not \nbe entirely correct [22].\nChatbot‑aided surgical choice\nWe entered every case description into either ChatGPT \n(version 3.5) or Google Gemini interface. Both platforms \nwere accessed on March 8 and 9, 2024. Firstly, we left the \nLLM analyze the entire case and highlight key findings. \nSuccessively, we investigated about the model’s ability \nto provide coherent surgical choices, writing the ques-\ntion “What kind of surgery would you perform?” (Figs.  1 \nand 2). In some instances, when the answers were overly \ngeneralist, we asked the model for further explanations \nregarding the treatment of choice, based on the specific \nconditions of the clinical case, asking the chatbots to \nchoose only one treatment. We logged all of the com-\nments based on our initial inquiry about provisional and \ndifferential surgical choices so that the two chatbots might \nlearn from the past. Finally, in order to assess chatbots’ \nanswers consistency, all questions were repeated three \ntimes, and possible changes in surgical suggestions were \ncollected.\n2948 Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology (2024) 262:2945–2959\nIn addition, three senior glaucoma specialists (G.G., A.B., \nand S.R.) were asked to analyze the same 66 cases and to \ndefine a shared surgical choice. Cohen coefficient analysis \nwas used to ensure that the concordance was at least 0.90. \nIf all three operators agreed, the ideal surgical treatment \nfor that specific case was identified. Otherwise, the experts \nFig. 1  Screenshot of ChatGPT-4 responses in a “challenging” case.

A Case description and Gemini analysis of \nthe case; B when asked for surgical advice, Google Gemini provided \nmore synthetic answers rich of web sources; C when asked to choose \nonly one treatment, Gemini frequently answered “I can’t choose one \ntreatment for this case.” However, it was able to present a list of sur -\ngical options, even though none of them was analyzed in details\n2949Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology (2024) 262:2945–2959 \ndiscussed the case, and if a univocal choice could not be \nreached, the case was excluded from the study. Since it was \nimpossible to obtain a comprehensive scenario outline, six \npatients with incomplete medical histories or anamnesis, \nmissing preoperative data or surgical records on the com -\nputer system, or receiving surgery straight from the emer -\ngency department were excluded from the study. In fact, the \nlack of complete pre-operative data raised doubts between \nthe specialists and determined inconsistent results derived \nfrom chatbots’ answers.\nA correct agreement between chatbots and specialists was \nconsidered real only if the chosen treatment of both were \nthe same. If the chatbot was not able to pick one treatment \namong the presented list, but the answer was indeed pre-\nsent in the list, we defined it as “partial agreement.” In the \nremaining cases, the answer was considered incorrect. At the \nend of the dialogue with ChatGPT and Gemini, the 7 oph-\nthalmologists included in this research graded the quality of \nthe answers provided by the two chatbots from 1 (poor qual-\nity) to 5 (excellent quality), according to the Global Quality \nScore (GQS) [25].\nAs the main outcome of this research, we wanted to define \nthe frequency of accurate surgical choice made by ChatGPT \nand Google Gemini, compared to those of glaucoma special-\nists facing the same clinical cases. As secondary outcome, \nwe compared the GQS of the two chatbots.\nGlobal Quality Score\nThe GQS, introduced by Bernard et al., is a subjective rate \nof the overall quality of each web site [25]. It consists in a \n5-point Likert scale, taking into account the flow and ease \nof use of each web site [25]. The complete scale is visible \nin Table 1.\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad \nPRISM software, (Version 9.5; GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). \nData were presented as mean ± standard deviation. χ2 test, \nFisher’s exact test, and Student’s t-test were conducted where \nappropriate. Correlation was calculated using Spearman’s \ncoefficient. For the GQS, the average score of each answer \nwas collected, and an overall average score was then cal-\nculated. In all cases, p  < 0.05 was considered statistically \nsignificant.\nResults\nOverall, a total agreement between specialists, in terms of \nsurgical choices, was reached in 60 cases (40 in the “ordi-\nnary” and 20 in the “challenging” subgroups. Glaucoma \nphenotypes of the studied cases are summarized in Table 2.\nOverall, when repeated questions were inserted three \ntimes in chatbots’ interfaces, ChatGPT gave consistent \nresults in 75% of cases (n = 57). In 18% of cases, the answers \nwere consistent in 2 out of the 3 repetitions, while on the \nother side, repeating the question to Google Gemini led to a \n72% rate of inconsistency. Google’s chatbot often answered \n“I cannot choose a specific treatment for this case,” “I cannot \ndefinitively recommend one specific treatment for glaucoma \nsurgery,” or “As a large language model, I am not a medical \nprofessional and cannot perform surgery.” In these cases, the \nmedical scenarios were presented up to 5 times to the chat-\nbots, and the most frequent answer was taken into account \nfor statistical analysis. When answers were completely \ninconsistent, the scenario analysis was considered incorrect.\nOverall, ChatGPT definitive surgical choice was consistent \nwith those of glaucoma specialists in 35/60 cases (58%), while \nTable 1  Description of the Global Quality Score 5-point scale for web site evaluation\nGlobal score Global score description\n1 Poor quality, poor flow of the site, most information missing, not at all useful for patients\n2 Generally poor quality and poor flow, some information listed but many important topics missing, of very limited use to patients\n3 Moderate quality, suboptimal flow, some important information is adequately discussed but others poorly discussed, somewhat \nuseful for patients\n4 Good quality and generally good flow, most of the relevant information is listed, but some topics not covered, useful for patients\n5 Excellent quality and excellent flow, very useful for patients\nTable 2  Glaucoma phenotype of the 60 selected medical records\nGlaucoma phenotype N = 60 (%)\nPrimary open-angle glaucoma 20 (33.3%)\nPrimary angle-closure glaucoma 10 (16.7%)\nPigmentary glaucoma 6 (10.0%)\nPseudoexfoliative glaucoma 6 (10.0%)\nNeovascular glaucoma 8 (13.3%)\nPost-vitrectomy glaucoma 4 (6.7%)\nUveitic glaucoma 3 (5.0%)\nSecondary angle-closure glaucoma 2 (3.3%)\nPost-traumatic glaucoma 1 (1.7%)\n2950 Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology (2024) 262:2945–2959\nGoogle Gemini showed concordance in surgical choices in \nonly 19/60 cases (32%). In the remaining 42% of cases, the \nspecialists’ choice was among the list proposed by ChatGPT \nin 21 cases (35%), while a completely incorrect answer was \ngiven in 4 cases. Conversely, Google Gemini was not able to \ncomplete the task when asked to perform a surgical choice, in \n16 cases (27%). This statement was presented 11 times among \n“ordinary” cases and 5 times among “challenging” case. Out \nof the remaining 26 cases, the specialists’ choice was among \nthe list proposed by Gemini in 18 of cases (30%), while 7 \nanswers were considered incorrect (12%).\nChatGPT’s most frequent advice was trabeculectomy \n(n = 32, 53%), followed by glaucoma draining devices \n(n = 11, 18%), MIGS ( n = 9, 15%), and laser trabeculo -\nplasty (n = 4, 7%). Similarly, out of the 44 completed tasks, \nGemini’s favorite answer was trabeculectomy (n = 22, 50%), \nfollowed by MIGS and GDD (n = 9 for both, 20%).\nContingency analysis showed significantly better results \nfor ChatGPT when compared to Gemini’s performances \n(p = 0.0001).\nChatGPT vs. Google Bard in “Ordinary” cases\nWhen considering the 40 aforementioned “ordinary” sce-\nnarios, ChatGPT showed 65% of consistency with glaucoma \nspecialists (26/40), while Gemini was consistent in 15/40 \ncases (38%). The difference in performance between the two \nwas statistically significant (p = 0.004).\nA comparison of the answers in some “ordinary” cases \nis visible in Table 3.\nChatGPT vs. Google Bard in “Challenging” cases\nSimilar results were reported when considering “challeng-\ning” cases. In particular, ChatGPT was consistent with the \nspecialists’ opinion in 9 out of 20 surgical choices, 45%, \nwhile Google Gemini performances were significantly lower \n(4/20 concordant answers, 20%), and in 10 cases (50%), the \nchatbot was not able to complete the task. Once again, con-\ntingency analysis showed significant differences regarding \nthe performances of the two chatbots (p = 0.001).\nA comparison of the answers of the two chatbots in “chal-\nlenging” cases is presented in Table 4.\nThe percentage of agreements between specialists’ opin-\nion and ChatGPT and Google Bard answers is summarized \nin Fig. 3.\nGlobal Quality Score results\nOverall, ChatGPT’s GQS was 3.5 ± 1.2, being significantly \nhigher than Google Gemini’s score (2.1 ± 1.5, p  = 0.002). \nIf only “ordinary” cases were considered, ChatGPT scored \n3.8 ± 0.7, while Google Gemini 2.6 ± 0.9, highlighting the \nsignificant difference between the two (p = 0.02). Similarly, \na significant difference was reported regarding “challeng-\ning” conditions, in which the Google Gemini score was sig-\nnificantly lower when compared to ChatGPT (1.5 ± 1.4 vs. \n3.0 ± 1.5, p = 0.001) (Fig. 3).\nThe aforementioned Google Gemini missing answers det-\nrimentally affected the GQS, since the platform appeared \nsignificantly less user-friendly for the ophthalmologists \nseeking for an advice in terms of surgical planning.\nDiscussion\nArtificial intelligence–powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT \nand Google Bard, have been heralded as revolutionary turn-\ning points in the current AI revolution. These chatbots are \nLLMs that employ machine learning and natural language \nprocessing to interact with people via text or voice inter -\nfaces. The possible application of LLMs in medicine has \ngarnered a lot of hype in recent months [2 , 26]. Healthcare \nprofessionals may get evidence-based real-time advices from \nchatbots to enhance patient outcomes [27]. For complicated \nmedical situations, they may provide clinical recommenda-\ntions, identify possible medication interactions, and recom-\nmend suitable courses of action [28]. Chatbots are able to \nidentify possible issues that human providers would not \nimmediately notice, thanks to their rapid access to vast vol-\numes of data and processing speed. They might also provide \nthe most recent information on recommendations and treat-\nment alternatives, guaranteeing the patients the best possible \ncares [27, 28].\nIn this research, we gathered 60 medical records to exam-\nine ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini’s capacity to define a \ncorrect surgical plan for glaucomatous patients. In particular, \nin order to test the two chatbots’ capacity on performing cor-\nrect differential diagnoses and deriving a coherent surgical \nplanning, we divided our sample into “ordinary” and “chal-\nlenging” scenarios and compared the given answers, to those \ngiven by glaucoma experts, which were asked to analyze the \nsame pool of clinical cases. Furthermore, we exploited the \n5-point Global Quality Score as a subjective parameter of \nchatbots’ quality, in terms of user-friendliness, speed of use, \nand accuracy and exhaustiveness in responses.\nOverall, ChatGPT showed an acceptable rate of agree -\nment with the glaucoma specialists (58%), while being able \nto provide a coherent list of answers in another 35% of cases, \nlimiting completely incorrect answer to 7%. ChatGPT’s \nresults significantly outperformed Gemini in this setting. \nGoogle’s chatbot indeed showed high unreliability, with \nonly 32% rate of agreement with specialists and a 27% rate \nof non-completed tasks. In particular, Gemini often stated \n2951Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology (2024) 262:2945–2959 \nTable 3  Comparison of ChatGPT and Google Gemini’s answers in “ordinary” cases, along with the Global Quality Score (mean ± standard deviation) reported from the ophthalmologists\nQuestion ChatGPT answer Google Gemini answer ChatGPT GQS Google \nGemini \nGQS\nCase of a 75-year-old female with a 15-year history \nof primary open angle glaucoma.

The patient suffered a \nclosed globe injury associated with left retinal detachment, which \nwas treated with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and silicone oil (SO) \ntamponade. He was already pseudophakic. His best-corrected \nvisual acuity (BCVA) was counting fingers and intraocular pressure \n(IOP) was 30 mmHg, without ocular hypotensive agents. Slit-lamp \nexamination showed total iris absence associated with partial (< 2 \nclock h) loss of zonules. The intraocular lens (IOL) was inside the \ncapsular bag, centered, and not tilted. There was accumulation of \nSO droplets (fish eggs) in the anterior chamber. Retina was attached \nwith no signs of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. The cup to disk \n(C/D) ratio was 0.7. Glaucoma eyedrops (dorzolamide-timolol com-\nbination), combined with dexamethasone, were started. One month \nlater, the patient underwent removal of SO (ROSO). During the \n2 months following ROSO, IOP was 15 mm Hg with (dorzolamide-\ntimolol combination). Unfortunately, the IOP gradually increased \nto 40 mm Hg and became refractive to antiglaucoma medications, \nwith the patient complaining of increasing glare and photophobia\nWhat kind of surgery would you perform?\nChoose only one treatment\nIn managing a case like the one described, where a 65-year-old male presents with \npost-traumatic aniridia and glaucoma, refractory to medication with a history of \nclosed globe injury, retinal detachment treated with pars plana vitrectomy and \nsilicone oil tamponade, and now experiencing increasing intraocular pressure \n(IOP) and symptoms of glare and photophobia, a multifaceted surgical approach \nis needed. The management goals would focus on controlling the IOP, addressing \nthe structural issues in the eye (like the aniridia and the zonular instability), and \nmanaging the patient's symptoms\n1. Glaucoma Surgery: Given the IOP's refractory nature to medical management, \nsurgical intervention is warranted. Options include trabeculectomy or glaucoma \ndrainage device implantation. These surgeries aim to create a new pathway for \naqueous humor to leave the eye, thereby reducing IOP. The choice between these \noptions would depend on the specifics of the case, including the severity of the \nglaucoma, the eye's anatomy, and the surgeon's experience and preference\n2. Aniridia and Zonular Instability Management: The absence of the iris (aniridia) and \npartial loss of zonules can contribute to the patient's symptoms of glare and pho-\ntophobia, as well as potentially complicate intraocular surgeries. Custom artificial \niris devices could be considered for implantation to reduce these symptoms and \nimprove cosmetic appearance. If there is significant zonular instability, a capsular \ntension ring (CTR) or specialized intraocular lens (IOL) with zonular support might \nbe necessary to stabilize the lens capsule and maintain IOL centration\n3. Management of Complications from Previous Interventions: The presence of sili-\ncone oil droplets in the anterior chamber (SO droplets) suggests that there may have \nbeen complications from the previous vitrectomy and tamponade. Removal of these \ndroplets may be considered during the surgical intervention to improve the patient's \nvisual quality and reduce the risk of further complications\n4. Consideration for Visual Rehabilitation: Given the patient's complex ocular history \nand current visual acuity, a thorough evaluation of potential for visual rehabilitation \nshould be considered post-surgery. This could involve low vision aids and adaptive \ntechnologies, depending on the final visual outcome\nConsidering the scenario presented and the advancements in the management of \nrefractory glaucoma, I would recommend the use of glaucoma drainage devices. \nThis recommendation is based on their effectiveness in controlling IOP in patients \nwith glaucoma refractory to medical treatment and their utility in situations where \ntraditional surgeries like trabeculectomy might have a higher risk of failure or com-\nplications. Glaucoma drainage devices have been shown to be an effective option \nfor managing complex glaucoma cases, providing long-term IOP control\nThe patient has silicone oil-induced glaucoma which is a known \ncomplication after vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade.

He had no history \nof trauma or previous eye surgeries and had never undergone an \nophthalmological examination. Examination revealed a vision of \n6/36 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye (OS). The right eye had \na conjunctival injection and corneal edema with 360° of rubeosis \niridis (NVI). The left eye showed a clear cornea with subtle vessels \nat the pupillary margin. His IOP was 52 mmHg in the right eye \nand 12 mmHg in the left eye. Dilated fundus examination (DFE) \nof the right eye was limited due to corneal edema, but it was highly \nsuggestive of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). DFE of the \nleft eye fundus showed a clear vitreous with PDR. Gonioscopy \nrevealed Shaffer grade 1 over 360° with neovascularization of the \nangle OD and Shaffer grade 3 over 360° and no neovascularization \nof the angle in the left eye. On initial presentation, the patient was \ndiagnosed with neovascular glaucoma (NVG) OD with a high-risk \nPDR in both eyes (OU).

His IOP was still \nabove 40 mmHg and pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) could not \nbe performed due to corneal edema\nWhat kind of surgery would you perform?\nChoose only one treatment\nGiven the complexity and severity of the patient's condition with neovascular \nglaucoma (NVG) secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and con-\nsidering the failure of initial medical management to control intraocular pressure \n(IOP), surgical intervention is indeed warranted. The patient's IOP remains elevated \ndespite aggressive medical therapy, including intravitreal injection of bevacizumab, \nindicating refractory NVG. In cases like this, where there is significant neovascu-\nlarization and high IOP refractory to conservative management, options for surgical \nintervention may include:\n1. Panretinal Photocoagulation (PRP): Although initially not feasible due to corneal \nedema, PRP should be considered once the cornea clears. PRP is effective in \nregressing neovascularization by treating the ischemic retinal areas that produce \nangiogenic factors leading to NVG\n2. Trabeculectomy with Mitomycin C (MMC): This procedure aims to create a new \ndrainage pathway for aqueous humor to decrease IOP. MMC is used to reduce scar-\nring and increase the success rate of the surgery. However, the success rate can be \nlower in eyes with NVG due to the risk of fibrosis and neovascularization at the site\n3. Glaucoma Drainage Devices (GDDs): In cases where trabeculectomy is unlikely \nto succeed or has failed, implantation of a GDD can help control IOP by diverting \naqueous humor to an external reservoir\n4. Cyclophotocoagulation: For eyes with poor visual potential or when other surgical \noptions are not viable, cyclophotocoagulation can reduce aqueous production and \nlower IOP. It's less invasive but also less predictable in its outcomes\n5. Vitreoretinal Surgery: In cases with concurrent vitreoretinal pathology, such as \ntractional retinal detachment associated with PDR, vitreoretinal surgery may be \nnecessary in addition to addressing the NVG\nThe choice of surgical intervention should be tailored to the patient's specific clinical \nscenario, including the severity of NVG, the potential for visual recovery, and the \npresence of other ocular or systemic conditions. Close collaboration with a retinal \nspecialist may also be beneficial, given the underlying PDR. The ultimate goal is to \ncontrol IOP to prevent further optic nerve damage while addressing the underlying \nproliferative disease to halt the progression of NVG\nGiven the condition of neovascular glaucoma (NVG) and considering the available \nevidence and treatment outcomes, I would recommend glaucoma drainage implant \n(GDI) surgery as the preferred surgical intervention. This option is particularly \nviable for late-stage NVG, where conventional surgeries like trabeculectomy might \nhave limited success due to the high risk of failure from fibrovascular growth and \npotential intraoperative complications such as bleeding. GDIs have been shown \nto effectively manage intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with NVG by provid-\ning an alternative pathway for aqueous humor drainage, thereby bypassing the \ncompromised trabecular meshwork. This surgical option is typically recommended \nwhen medical management and other surgical options are insufficient or have failed \nto control IOP adequately\nIt is not advisable for me to recommend a specific surgery as I am \nnot a medical professional. However, the search results suggest \nthat surgery for neovascular glaucoma is typically performed when \nother treatments fail to control intraocular pressure. Here are some \nsurgical approaches that may be considered depending on the \nspecific case\n1. Trabeculectomy with anti-VEGF medications\n2.

However, ordinary \ncases often allow multiple surgical or parasurgical possi-\nbilities based on surgeons’ preference.

Surely, it is important to \nacknowledge that complex cases require a multimodal man-\nagement and, meantime, that different kind of treatments \nshould be evaluated. Nevertheless, even not always being \nconcordant with specialists’ opinions, ChatGPT showed an \nincredible capability to analyze all parts of the scenario, \nas visible in the answers in Table  3, being able to propose \ncombined surgeries (e.g., cataract, vitrectomy, artificial iris \nimplantation) in a comprehensive treatment. On the other \nhand, Gemini analysis in these cases was often scarce and \nincomplete, thus not being able to define a thorough surgi-\ncal plan.\nThese results reflected also on GQS, which were signifi-\ncantly higher for ChatGPT (3.5 ± 1.2) rather than Gemini \n(2.1 ± 1.5), and this difference augmented when focusing \non “challenging” cases. ChatGPT was indeed more user-\nfriendly and able to perform a more in-depth analysis of the \nclinical cases, giving specific and coherent answers even in \nthe highly specific context of surgical glaucoma. Moreover, \nwhen asked to choose only one treatment, it was always able \nto pick one of the previously listed treatments, different from \nGemini’s approach.\nThe effectiveness of ChatGPT in ophthalmology pano-\nrama was already investigated: a resent research showed that \nChatGPT scored an accuracy of 59.4% answering questions \nof the Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) \ntest, while on the OphthoQuestions testing set, it achieved \n49.2% [6]. ChatGPT also was much more accurate than Isa-\nbel Pro, one of the most popular and accurate diagnostic \nassistance systems, in terms of diagnostic accuracy in oph-\nthalmology cases [29]. Similarly, the diagnostic capabili-\nties of this LLM were studied by Delsoz et al. on glaucoma \npatients, reporting a 72.7% accuracy in preliminary diagno-\nsis [30]. Furthermore, compared to ophthalmology residents, \nChatGPT constantly showed a higher number of differential \ndiagnoses [30]. Recently, Kianian et al. highlighted Chat-\nGPT’s effectiveness in creating content and rewriting infor-\nmation regarding uveitis, in order to make them easier to \ndigest and aid patients in learning more about this pathology \nand treat it more adequately [31].\nFig. 3  Histograms showing A the level of agreement between Chat-\nGPT and Google Gemini’s answers and those provided by glaucoma \nspecialists in all cases and in “ordinary” and “challenging” scenarios. \nComplete agreement was assessed when the final choice of the chat-\nbot was consistent with the one provided by specialists, while par -\ntial agreement included cases in which the correct answer was listed \nbut not picked as preferred choice by the chatbot; B the comparison \nbetween the Global Quality Scores assigned by ophthalmologists to \nthe two chatbots’ performance and usability (showed as mean and \nstandard deviation).

Gan et al. compared the performance \nof the two chatbots in triaging patients in mass casualty inci-\ndents, showing that Google Bard was able to make a 60% \nrate of correct triages, similar to that of medical students. \nOn the other side, ChatGPT had a significantly higher rate of \nover-triage [9]. Koga et al. analyzed LLMs’ ability to gener-\nate differential diagnoses about neurodegenerative disorders, \nbased on clinical summaries. ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and \nGoogle Bard included correct diagnoses in 76%, 84%, and \n76% of cases, respectively, demonstrating that LLMs can \npredict pathological diagnoses with reasonable accuracy [8].\nThe theoretical advantage of using a LLM in a clinical \nsetting relies on more accurate, fast, and impartial answers, \nindeed available at any time. Moreover, these models are \nable to actively train, based on reinforcement-learning \ncapabilities, allowing the models to improve over time and \nrectify prior errors [30]. Although these models require \nless human monitoring and supervision for active training \nthan supervised learning models, their training data con -\ntain non-peer-reviewed sources which could include factual \ninaccuracies [32]. It is important to say that due to a large \noverlap between physiological and pathological parameters, \nglaucoma management is extremely subjective and has low \nagreement, even among highly competent glaucoma experts \n[33]. In this setting, AI chatbots may not be able to han-\ndle circumstances requiring human judgment, empathy, or \nspecialized knowledge due to their limits, making regular \nhuman oversight essential; before making any final judg-\nment and doing the necessary steps, their regular oversight \nand evaluation are thus essential [34]. In our research, \nChatGPT outperformed Google Gemini in terms of surgi -\ncal choice, giving more specific answers on the majority \nof clinical cases. These results are consistent with a previ-\nous research conducted by our group, in which ChatGPT \nand Google Gemini were asked to face surgical cases of \nretinal detachment. In that setting, GPT-4 reached an 84% \nrate of agreement with vitreoretinal surgeons, while Gemini \nonly reached 70% of agreement [35]. Notably, those results \nare significantly higher than those reported in a glaucoma \nsetting. We indeed hypothesize that surgical decisions in \nvitreoretinal surgery are much more limited and follow \nmore precise hinges, when compared to the immensity \nof glaucoma surgical treatments and the possible overlap \nbetween them. However, in both studies, ChatGPT showed \nbetter performances in terms of scenario analysis and surgi-\ncal planning, suggesting that the newly presented Google \nGemini still lacks optimization in the medical field.\nFurthermore, although ChatGPT has demonstrated \nencouraging results, its immediate application in clinical \ncare settings may be constrained. The incapacity to interpret \ndiagnostic data, such as eye fundus pictures or visual fields, \nmay impair the ability to conduct comprehensive examina-\ntions and furnish glaucoma specialists with accurate diag -\nnoses. Considering how much ophthalmology depends on \nvisual examination and imaging for patient diagnosis and \ntreatment, it appears necessary to include additional trans-\nformer models—like the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-\ntraining model—that can handle different data sources [36].\nAs far as we know, this is the first investigation in which \nAI-chatbots were asked to outline a surgical approach in a \nglaucoma setting. Moreover, we focused on a very specific \nsubject, such as surgical glaucoma, to analyze the computing \nperformances of ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Indeed, our \nresearch is affected by several limitations. First off, since the \ncase description was retrospective in nature, missing data \ncould have influenced chatbots’ answers. Second, we con-\ncentrated on a limited sample size, making further studies \nnecessary to assess the large-scale applications of our find-\nings. Additionally, the comparison with glaucoma surgeons’ \nchoices not always defines the best possible treatment, pos-\nsibly limiting the repeatability of these results.\nIn conclusion, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize \nophthalmology. In the future, particularly with the imple -\nmentation of new inputs, such as video or images, AI-based \nchatbots might become reliable mates in clinical and surgical \npractice. Having already showed their role in ophthalmology \nteaching, we demonstrated that ChatGPT-4 has the poten-\ntial to coherently analyze medical records of glaucomatous \npatients, showing a good level of agreement with knowl-\nedgeable glaucoma experts. On the other side, Google Gem-\nini showed strong limitations in this setting, presenting high \nrates of unprecise or missed answers, thus still requiring \nsignificant updates before effective application in the clinic.\nAcknowledgements None.\nAuthor contribution Conceptualization, M.M.C.; methodology, \nM.M.C. and G.G.; validation, A.S.; formal analysis, E.C.; investigation, \nM.M.C.; writing—original draft preparation, M.M.C; writing—review \nand editing, F.G. and F.B.; project administration, S.R.
