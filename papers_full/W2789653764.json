  "full_text": "Application of thyristor controlled phase shifting transformer\nexcitation impedance switching control to suppress short-circuit\nfault current level\nJun LIU 1 , Xudong HAO 1, Xu WANG 1, Yefu CHEN 1,\nWanliang FANG 1, Shuanbao NIU 2\nAbstract Short-circuit fault current suppression is a very\nimportant issue in modern large-interconnected power\nnetworks. Conventional short-circuit current limiters, such\nas superconducting fault current limiters, have to increase\nadditional equipment investments. Fast power electronics\ncontrolled ﬂexible AC transmission system (FACTS)\ndevices have opened a new way for suppressing the fault\ncurrent levels, while maintaining their normal functionali-\nties for steady-state and transient power system operation\nand control. Thyristor controlled phase shifting transformer\n(TCPST) is a beneﬁcial FACTS device in modern power\nsystems, which is capable of regulating regional power\nﬂow. The mathematical model for TCPST under different\noperation modes is ﬁrstly investigated in this study. Intu-\nitively, the phase shifting angle control can adjust the\nequivalent impedance of TCPST, but the effect has been\ndemonstrated to be weak. Therefore, a novel transformer\nexcitation impedance switching (EIS) control method, is\nproposed for fault current suppressing, according to the\nimpedance characteristics of TCPST. Simulation results on\nIEEE 14-bus system have shown considerable current\nlimiting characteristic of the EIS control under various\nfault types. Also, analysis of the timing requirement during\nfault interruption, overvoltage phenomenon, and ancillary\nmechanical support issues during EIS control is discussed,\nso as to implement the proposed EIS control properly for\nfast fault current suppression.\nKeywords Excitation impedance switching (EIS) control,\nInterruption time sequence, Phase shifting angle (PSA)\ncontrol, Short-circuit fault current suppression, Thyristor-\ncontrolled phase shifting transformer (TCPST)\n1 Introduction\nPower system short-circuit fault current level has kept\nrising due to a variety of reasons, such as the increasing\ndemand for electricity with economic development [ 1, 2],\nincreasing installed generation capacity of power systems,\nincreasing construction of the transmission network, etc.\nThe peak value of short-circuit fault current is the primary\nconcern for selecting power circuit breakers and other\npower equipments [ 3, 4].

Therefore, short-circuit fault current\nmagnitude expansion has become a nonnegligible problem\nof large interconnected power systems. To suppress the\nfault current level has become one of the research hotspots\nin modern power system operation and control area.\nThere are two possible stages to handle the short-circuit\ncurrent increasing issue, one is power system level, through\nnetwork operation and reconﬁguration; and the other is\ncomponent level, through the application of additional fault\ncurrent limiting power equipments.\nFor the ﬁrst power system operation and reconﬁguration\nrelated method, power engineers may adopt the following\ntechniques, such as: using higher voltage level, which might\nreduce the fault current level with equal MVA capacity;\nperforming load shedding and islanding operations when\npermitted [ 5], which can separate the system into some\nsmaller subsystems with lower short-circuit level; or\napplying intelligent switchgear for smart transmission\nswitching under the smart grid environment [ 4, 6], etc.\nIn practice, it is always not so easy to suppress the short-\ncircuit fault current by power system level operation and\ncontrol in real-time, because the slower speed of system\nlevel scheduling. However, the response of fault current\nlimiting devices is always much faster, and various models\nof fault current limiters have been designed during the last\nfew decades, including:\n1) Superconducting fault current limiters (SFCL), when\nthe fault current value exceeds the conductor’s critical\nvalue, they can change their resistance values from the\nsuperconducting state to the resistive state very fast\n[7, 8].\n2) Microprocessor-controlled fault current limiters\n[9–12], which might be comprised of either LC\nresonant circuits or reactors, and they can also adjust\ntheir impedances during faults.\n3) Current limiting type fuses, they can be considered as\nnonlinear resistances that are able to force a current\nzero rapidly [ 13–15].\n4) The current limiters based on FACTS type devices, for\nexample, thyristor controlled series compensation\n(TCSC), which is able to limit the current by\nincreasing the series inductance of the attached lines\n[16]. Interphase power controller (IPC) that is com-\nposed of a conventional phase-shifting transformer\n(PST) and a static synchronous series compensator,\nand it has the ability of short-circuit current mitigation\nand power ﬂow control [ 17]. Bridge-type fault current\nlimiter (BFCL) that uses a switched transformer-type\nDC reactor, whilst the load current exceeds a prede-\nﬁned threshold, the secondary side of the transformer\ncan be opened by an insulated gate bipolar transistor\n[18].\nThese FACTS type devices have possible capability of\nbeing applied for fault current suppression, because they\ncan perform power ﬂow regulation functions under steady-\nstate operation conditions [ 19], and can also be switched to\nan emergency control status during serious faults. Thyris-\ntor-controlled phase shifting transformer (TCPST) is a\nspecial FACTS device with a series and a parallel power\ntransformer, which fulﬁlls fast phase angle adjustment of\nthe voltage across the device to regulate regional power\nﬂow [ 20–22]. However, the fault current suppressing\ncapability for the TCPST device has seldom been referred\nby past researches. Since the investments on TCPST would\nbe rather expensive, it is necessary to perform other\nfunctions besides voltage phase shifting and power ﬂow\ncontrolling, such as short-circuit current suppressing, con-\nsidering the fast control properties of power electronic\nswitches inside the TCPST.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. The varying\nequivalent impedance of TCPST is derived in Section 2,\naccording to the working mode of the power electronic\nswitches. The phase shifting angle (PSA) control for fault\ncurrent limiting, is brieﬂy analyzed in Section 3. Since it\nhas been proven to have not very good suppression effect\non the short-circuit fault current in our previous work [ 20],\na novel short-circuit fault current suppression method\nnamed as transformer excitation impedance switching\n(EIS) control is proposed, based on the varying impedance\ncharacteristics of TCPST. Simulation results have shown\nthat the novel EIS control method has a more remarkable\ncurrent suppressing performance. Then, Section 4 evalu-\nates the potential interruption time sequence for power\ncircuit breakers and the mechanical support issues that\nmight be induced by the EIS control scheme. Finally, the\nconclusions are given in Section 5.\n2 Modeling of TCPST based on its equivalent\nimpedance\nPower system PSTs usually comprise of two trans-\nformers to fulﬁll voltage phase angle shifting operation,\none parallel excitation transformer (ET) and one series\nbooting transformer (BT). The two transformers can be\nconnected through wye-wye or wye-delta wiring, then the\nvoltage vector of the BT winding is able to be regulated by\nthe switching control circuit, which can turn the original\nvoltage vector into a different voltage vector with the\nobjective amplitude and phase angle. Two types of com-\nmon connections for PSTs are shown in Fig. 1. Typically,\nif the input ( i) and output ( j) of the PST have equal voltage\namplitudes, it is called a symmetric type PST, as shown in\nFig. 1b. Otherwise, it is asymmetric type PST, as shown in\nFig. 1a.\n822 Jun LIU et al.\n123\nThe control circuit of PSTs might have plenty of dif-\nferent topology structures, with different operation mech-\nanisms and mathematical models correspondingly; several\ntypes of controllable PSTs can be obtained in the relevant\nliteratures [ 23–25]. Due to space limit, it is not suitable to\nanalyze every different types of PSTs in-depth about their\ninﬂuence on short-circuit fault current suppression, or their\neffectiveness as new types of short-circuit current limiters.\nTherefore, one newer type of PST, named two core sym-\nmetrical discrete phase shifting transformer (TCSD type\nPST) [ 25], is chosen in this study to investigate its potential\nfor short-circuit fault current suppression.\nThe main electrical circuit of TCPST (short for TCSD\ntype PST in this study) is presented in Fig. 2a, which\ncontains a transformer (ET) in parallel, a transformer (BT)\nin series, and the power electronics control circuit to switch\namong different connection modes [ 26, 27]. To make it\nmore convenient for writing, the ET winding connected\ndirectly to the transmission line is named primary winding\nE1, and the winding that has magnetic coupling with the\nprimary winding E1 is called secondary winding, which\ncan be divided into three parts, denoted by E2, E3 and E4.\nThe taps ratio of ET’s secondary winding E2 and E3 and\nE4 is set as 1:3:9. BT’s primary winding is separated into\ntwo segments, named as B1 and B2 respectively; the sec-\nondary winding for BT is expressed as B3. The connection\ntopology of the power electronic switches for ET’s three\nsecondary windings is shown in Fig. 2b. Different on/off\nstatus combinations of the electronic switches can provide\n27 operation modes T, corresponding to 27 different phase\nshifting angle values u. To fulﬁll the function of voltage\nregulation, the tap positions of ET’s secondary winding can\nbe adjusted through the 12 power electronic switches inside\nthe switching control circuit. Each power electronic switch\ncontains a pair of reverse parallel thyristors, the structural\ndiagram is shown in Fig. 2c. The detailed relationship\nbetween operation mode T and the status of the three ET’s\nsecondary windings are listed in Fig. A1 and Table A1 in\n‘‘Appendix A ’’. It should be noted that the power thyristors\nused in this study are taken as ideal switches, neglecting\nthe transients and harmonics inside these power electronic\ndevices.\nSwitching\ncircuit\nY    Y\nBT\n(a)\nVj\nVB\nϕ\nSwitching\ncircuit\nY    Y\n(b)\nET\nϕ\nVi\n.\n. .\nVi\n.\nVB\n.

Assuming that the three-phase parameters\nfor the TCPST are symmetric, make Z\nB1, ZB2, ZB3, ZE1 and\nZT be BT and ET’s winding impedances of the TCPST, and\nZBM1, ZBM2 and ZEM denote respectively the excitation\nimpedances for transformers BT and ET.\nAccording to Fig. 3, the turns ratio of the BT winding\ncan be expressed as:\nUB3\nUB1\n¼ NB3\nNB1\n¼ nB\nUB3\nUB2\n¼ NB3\nNB2\n¼ nB\n8\n>>\n<\n>>:\nð1Þ\nwhere U\nB1, UB2, UB3 are the induced voltage amplitudes\nfor BT’s windings 1, 2, 3, respectively; NB1, NB2, NB3 are\nthe numbers of turns of the BT’s windings, respectively; nB\nis the turn ratio for BT winding 3 to 1, or 3 to 2. These\nnumber of turns are determined by transformer design, and\nthe turns ratio is decided by the system phase-shifting angle\ntaps, all the number of turns and turns ratio values are ﬁxed\nconstants after the completion of phase shifter\nmanufacturing.\nThe turns ratio of transformer ET is:\nUE1\nUT\n¼ NE1\nTNT\n¼ nT T ¼/C6 1; /C6 2; /C1/C1/C1 ; /C6 13 ð2Þ\nwhere UE1 is the voltage magnitude of ET’s primary\nwinding; UT is the voltage magnitude of ET’s secondary\nwinding; nT is the corresponding turns ratio under\noperation mode T; NE1 is the number of turns for the\ntransformer ET’s primary winding; NT is the number of\nturns inside each tap of the transformer ET’s secondary\nwinding.\nFor BT’s primary side, the original winding is separated\ninto two equal segments, it is obvious to acquire the fol-\nlowing magnetic potential balance equation, while ignoring\nthe exciting current.\nNB1 _IB1 þ NB2 _IB2 þ NB3 _IB3 ¼ 0 ð3Þ\nAccording to ( 1), we have:\n_IB1 þ _IB2 þ nB _IB3 ¼ 0 ð4Þ\nwhere _IB1 and _IB2 are the currents through windings B1 and\nB2; _IB3 is the current of BT’s secondary winding.\nUnder operation mode T, the current magnitude of ET’s\nprimary and secondary winding has the following\nrelationship:\nIT\nIE1\n¼ NE1\nTNT\n¼ nT ð5Þ\nConsidering the symmetric characteristic of three phase\ncurrents, it can be derived that:\n_IE1a ¼/C0\n_ITa\nnT\n¼/C0 1\nnT\nð_IB3b /C0 _IB3cÞ¼ j\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\nnT\n_IB3a ð6Þ\nThus, the current of ET’s primary winding _IE1 in the\nsingle-phase expression is:\n_IE1 ¼ j\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\nnT\n_IB3 ð7Þ\nAt the point ‘‘O’’ of Fig. 3, the current relationship can\nbe written as:\n_IE1 ¼ _IB1 /C0 _IB2 ð8Þ\nEliminating the current of BT’s secondary winding _IB3,\nand considering ( 3), ( 7) and ( 8), we have:\n_IB2 ¼ 1 þ j\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\n=ðnT nBÞ\n1 /C0 j\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\n=ðnT nBÞ\n_IB1 ð9Þ\n_IE1 ¼ 2\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\nþ jnT nB\n_IB1 ð10Þ\nFrom ( 9), the currents through windings B1 and B2,\nnamely _IB1 and _IB2 are equal, so the phase shifting angle u\ncan be deﬁned as:\neju ¼ 1 þ j\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\n=ðnT nBÞ\n1 /C0 j\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\n=ðnT nBÞ\nð11Þ\nConsidering the turns ratios in ( 1) and ( 2), the angle u\ncan be further expressed as:\nFig. 3 ‘ ‘T’’ shape equivalent circuit of transformers BT and ET\nconsidering impedances of all windings\n824 Jun LIU et al.\n123\nu ¼ 2 arctan\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\nnT nB\n¼ 2 arctan\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\nNB2NT\nNB3NE1\nT\n/C18/C19\nð12Þ\nTherefore, ( 9) can be rewritten as a function of the phase\nshifting angle u:\n_IB2 ¼ eju _IB1 ð13Þ\nAccording to Ohm’s Law, the voltage relationship\nacross the TCPST can be obtained from Fig. 3.

However, most\nresearches have neglected the varying impedance of\nTCPST during steady-state and transient studies in the\npast [ 23–26].\n3 Effect of EIS control on short-circuit current\nsuppression\nAccording to the mathematical modeling of TCPST in\nSection 2, a very natural way to suppress the fault current\nlevels on the transmission lines by TCPST, is the phase\nshifting angle (PSA) control method. The current sup-\npression effect by PSA control can be referred to our\nprevious paper [ 20]. However, the current limiting capa-\nbility of PSA control seems not high enough to assist the\nfault interrupting for power circuit breakers. Therefore,\nanother method by transformer EIS control is presented in\nthis study.\n3.1 Principle of transformer EIS control\nAccording to ( 30), the equivalent series impedance Z\neq\nof the TCPST varies with the operation mode T of the\ncontrol circuit. The novel EIS control principle is to adjust\nthe control circuit to the operation mode T = 0. It can be\ndrawn from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 that, when stopping the\ntriggering pulse for the parallel transformer ET’s secondary\nwinding, namely, blocking all power electronic devices, the\nparallel transformer ET’s secondary side will enter the\nopen-circuit status. Under this mode T = 0, the trans-\nformer ET’s tap ratio n\nT can be seen as inﬁnity, thus the\nequivalent circuit can be simpliﬁed to Fig. 5, according to\npositive sequence fault analysis. And it can be clearly seen\nthat the EIS control means to insert a huge impedance into\nthe transmission line between supplying end S and loading\nend L.\nAs the series transformer BT’s secondary winding is\nconnected to parallel transformer ET’s secondary side in\nFig. 4 Simpliﬁed equivalent circuit diagram for TCPST according to\nmathematical model\n826 Jun LIU et al.\n123\nthis situation, thus the delta connection for the series\ntransformer BT’s secondary winding is suspended, looking\nlike that it is also open-circuit, then the equivalent circuit\ncan be further simpliﬁed to Fig. 6.\nIt can be observed from Fig. 6 that, when BT’s sec-\nondary winding is open-circuit, the equivalent impedance\nof the TCPST becomes:\nZ\nTCPST ¼ ZB1 þ ZBM þ ZB2 ð31Þ\nwhere ZBM ¼ ZBM1 þ ZBM2 is the combination of BT’s\nexcitation impedances, in series with its leakage impedance\nZB1 and ZB2, together forms the equivalent impedance\nunder the open-circuit condition of BT’s secondary\nwinding.\nBecause of the extremely large value of excitation\nimpedance Z\nBM for typical transformers, the proposed EIS\ncontrol can be used to limit the short-circuit current to a\nrather small value. Noting that _Ið1Þ\nB1 ¼ _Ið1Þ\nB2 in this situation,\nnone phase shifting angle is applied during EIS control,\nonly the huge impedance in ( 31) is applied in the\ntransmission line, which is a completely new control\nscheme for short-circuit fault current suppression.\n3.2 TCPST parameter description\nAccording to the mathematical model and equivalent\ncircuit of TCPST in the previous section, the simulation\nparameters are chosen according to a base voltage of\n525 kV and base capacity of 100 MVA. The three phase\ncapacity for the TCPST is 2274 MVA, with a symmetric\ntype, the switching modes as ± 13, and the rated shifting\nangle is ± 25/C176. All the other parameters for this TCSD\ntype PST are acquired from Electric Power Research\nInstitute of Shanghai Electric Power Company [ 28], as\nlisted in Table 1.\n3.3 Validation of EIS control under various fault\ntypes\nPSCAD simulation is used to test the short-circuit cur-\nrent suppression effect by the proposed EIS control\nmethod. The test system is IEEE 14-bus standard system,\nand only one TCPST is applied to the line 13–14. Impose a\nthree-phase symmetrical short-circuit fault at 0.2 s on\ntransmission line 13–14 close to the bus 14 side. Assuming\nthe identiﬁcation of short-circuit fault is exactly at 0.2 s\ninstantaneously, and the switching time of ET’s secondary\nside power electronic devices is set as 0.01 s after the fault.\nThe simulated three phase transient current waveforms are\nshown in Fig. 7a, with the red, blue and green curves\ndenote the corresponding three phases, respectively. It can\nbe seen in Fig. 7a that, the amplitudes of the short-circuit\ncurrent are greatly reduced after the application of EIS\ncontrol of TCPST, the peak current value of the ﬁrst cycle\nis about 19.33 kA (without EIS control of TCPST), and it\ncan be reduced to about 4.56 kA in the following cycles\n(with EIS control of TCPST), which means that the current\namplitude has decrease by about 76.4%, the results are also\ngiven in Table 2.\n(1)\nLS\nBT\nIB1 ZB1(1)\nUS\n(1)..

And the short-circuit current\namplitude will decrease by 75.1%, 64.0% and 62.0%,\nrespectively.\n3.4 Comparison of EIS control with PSA control\nmethods\nIt can be seen from Fig. 7 that, before excitation\nimpedance being injected to the system, the instantaneous\nvalue of short-circuit current goes extremely high as the\npeak value is several times bigger of its rated peak value\nbefore 0.2 s. After 0.21 s, the secondary side of the series\ntransformer BT is switched to an open-circuit condition,\nfault current decreases enormously due to the inﬂuence of\ntransformer excitation impedance, to about 1/4 of its\noriginal short-circuit current peak value. It can be seen in\nTable 2 that the fault current suppression can reach of\n62.0% to 76.4%, much more effective than the effect of\nbelow 10% of PSA control in our previous researches [ 20].\nBecause the series transformer’s secondary side is switched\nto an open-circuit status by EIS control, the TCPST can act\nas a new type of short-circuit current limiter.\n4 Discussion\nThrough EIS control, TCPST can be acted as a new type\nof short-circuit current suppresser for power system secure\noperation, it might also have several potential issues from\nthe viewpoint of power equipments, including fault inter-\nruption time requirements for power breakers and the\npotential ancillary mechanical support.\n4.1 Time sequence analysis for fault clearing\nThe prerequisite of using EIS control of TCPST to\nsuppress short-circuit fault current level is that, it has to\ncomplete the operation mode adjustment before the inter-\nrupting operation of high voltage circuit breakers; other-\nwise, it would be of no use to the power breakers. The time\nsequence for protective relay operation and breaker inter-\nruption has been shown in Fig. 8. In the ﬁrst period, the\naction of protective relays including short-circuit fault\nFig. 7 Short-circuit current simulation by EIS control with BT’s\nsecondary side open\nTable 2 Short-circuit current suppression effect of EIS control of\nTCPST\nShort-circuit\ncurrent peak\nvalues\nThree-\nphase\nfault\nTwo-\nphase\nfault\nDouble\nphase-\ngrounded\nfault\nSingle\nphase-\ngrounded\nfault\nWithout EIS\ncontrol (kA)\n19.33 14.94 - 19.55 19.33\nWith EIS\ncontrol (kA)\n4.56 3.72 - 7.03 7.35\nDecrease per-\ncentage (%)\n76.4 75.1 64.0 62.0\n828 Jun LIU et al.\n123\nidentiﬁcation, calculation time of protection setting, trip-\nping delay; and then an opening instruction is given to\ncircuit breakers according to safety setting parameters of\nthe protective relays. During the interruption period of\ncircuit breakers, the short-circuit opening time includes two\nparts: the contact parting time, and the arcing time before\ncurrent zero, according to standard ANSI/IEEE-\nC37.010.\nAccording to another standard IEC-62271, breaker\ninherent breaking time is usually provided by the manu-\nfacturer. As for the 500 kV level breakers, i.e. Siemens\nGermany 3AP live tank circuit breaker is not more than\ntwo fundamental cycles 40 ms [ 29], Pinggao Electric\nChina LW6-550 series breaker has an inherent breaking\ntime of 28 ms [ 30]. And the triggering pulse for modern\npower electronic devices can be as fast as less than 10 ms\n[31, 32], which is sufﬁcient to implement the proposed\ntransformer EIS control method before the contact sepa-\nration of breakers so as to interrupt a comparatively small\nshort-circuit fault current.\n4.2 Overvoltage analysis for proposed EIS control\nPSCAD simulations are performed to investigate the\novervoltage phenomenon induced by the EIS control\noperation of TCPST. Since the EIS control is initiated by\nblocking all power electronic devices on the parallel\ntransformer ET’s secondary side, the protection of the\nswitching circuit is not part of this study. Then the over-\nvoltage analysis is performed to check the tolerability of\nboth of the TCPST transformers during the proposed EIS\ncontrol.\nThe TCPST current and voltage parameters are the same\nwith Section 3.3, take the most serious three phase fault as\nan example, the phase voltage curves of ET’s and BT’s\nsecondary side during fault are shown in Fig. 9.\nAs shown in Fig. 9a, the fault also occurs at 0.2 s as the\nprevious simulations, the peak voltage of the ET secondary\nside under normal operation is very close to 0 kV, because\nthe equivalent series impedance Z\neq is rather small so as to\ntransmit power through TCPST to the loading end. Then\nEIS control initiated at 0.21 s, the ET’s secondary side\nworks as open-circuit, the voltage peak value of phase a\nreaches up to 170.4/\nﬃﬃﬃ\n2\np\n= 120.5 kV, which does not\nexceed the system voltage level 525/3 = 175 kV. How-\never, in Fig. 9b, the voltage peak value of phase a of BT’s\nsecondary side ramps up to about 309.2/\nﬃﬃﬃ\n2\np\n= 218.6 kV\nafter EIS control, 1.637 times larger than the rated\ndesigning value of 231.25/\nﬃﬃﬃ\n3\np\n= 133.51 kV, which might\nimpose great challenge to the insulation and protection of\nBT transformer.\nTypically, surge arresters and multi-column MOVs in\nparallel, are suggested to avoid overvoltage phenomenon\nfor FACTS devices, during actual power system transient\noperations [ 33]. However, since the BT transformer are not\nselected equal to the 500 kV system voltage level, the\novervoltage and insulation issue would be no big problem\nfor our TCPST, as analyzed bellow:\n1) After applying EIS strategy, it can be seen in Fig. 9\nthat the high-frequency switching overvoltage (SOV)\nis not apparent on both ET and BT’s secondary side\nbecause the EIS control is only stopping the ﬁring of\nthe electronic switches. The transformer is able to\nwithstand several times of switching overvoltage as it\nis usually no bigger than the lightning impulse. The\nbasic insulation level (BIL) are typically 3 to 5 times\nof the system voltage for lightning impulse on power\nequipments according to IEEE Std C62.82.1 [ 34].\nAnd for the short duration temporary overvoltage\n(TOV) induced by the open-circuit control, the\nArcing \ntime\nContact parting \ntime\nRelay setting \ntime\nMode switching \ntime for TCPST\nFault \nindentifi-\ncation \nTripping \ndelay\nRelay operation time\nt\nInterrupting time\nOpening insturction \ngivenInitiation of\nshort-circuit\nExtinction\nof arc\nFault current limiting instruction given\nFig. 8 Interruption sequence for high voltage circuit breakers\nFig. 9 Phase voltages of ET’s and BT’s secondary side before and\nafter EIS control\nApplication of TCPST EIS control to suppress short-circuit fault current level 829\n123\ntransformers of 121 kV level is able to withstand\n230 kV of the temporary overvoltage, and the value\ncan reach up to 275 kV for the 145 kV level by IEEE\nStd C62.82.1 [ 34]. Therefore, it is feasible to select the\n230 kV-withstanding type transformer for the BT in\nour TCPST (275 kV-withstanding type would be more\nqualiﬁed for this study), which is larger than the\n218.6 kV overvoltage during the EIS control.\n2) As for the power electronic devices inside the TCPST,\ngenerally each power electronic switch contains a RC-\nsnubber circuit for overvoltage protection. On the\nother hand, because the breakthrough voltage of\nthyristor is very close to its rated voltage, the rated\nvoltage of the thyristor should always retain a certain\nmargin through the planning stage, typically 2 to 3\ntimes of the withstand peak voltage [ 35]. The over-\nvoltage under EIS control in this study is no bigger\nthan 2 times of the phase-ground voltage of the\nTCPST in our simulations. Therefore, the SOV and\nTOV overvoltage will not exert damage on the\nthyristors.\n4.3 Other potential issues for proposed EIS control\nIt is also worth noting that, the proposed EIS control\nscheme cannot avoid the ﬁrst-cycle peak of the fault current\nas typical fast current-limiting fuses do, because of the\napproximate 10 ms time required for operation mode\nswitching of the power electronic devices. Thereby, it might\nnot reduce the electrodynamic forces induces by the peak\ncurrent of the ﬁrst cycle, and possible mechanical support are\nstill needed for the transformer design for the TCPST.\nIn addition, the switching transient duty for thyristors in\nthe TCPST is beyond the scope of this study, and many\nprevious prototype tests have been performed for power\nelectronic switches in other FACTS devices, such as TCSC\n[16], IPC [ 17], etc, to provide fast and reliable switching\nduring short-circuit transients of power systems. The main\ncontribution of this study is providing new thoughts of\nchanging the equivalent series impedance of TCPST that is\nassociated with the transmission line, thus suppressing the\nshort-circuit fault current level when the power breakers\nare ordered to interrupt the fault.\n5 Conclusion\nIn order to suppress the power system short-circuit fault\ncurrent level, a novel fault current suppression control\nscheme for TCPST is proposed, without installing any\nadditional power equipments. From the electric circuit of\none typical TCPST, the varying equivalent impedance\nproperties are analysed theoretically, according to different\noperation modes of the power electronic switches. The\ntransformer EIS control is then proposed, by opening the\nsecondary winding of transformer ET after the fault being\ndetected, the TCPST can act as a large impedance being\ninjected to the associated transmission line. Through\nmathematical analysis and simulation, fault current sup-\npression by the EIS control has shown more excellent\ncurrent limiting capability by reducing the fault current by\n62.0% to 76.4% within one cycle, comparing with those of\nno more than 10% by PSA control of TCPST [ 20]. Further\nanalysis for the fault clearing time sequence and possible\nmechanical support issues, is also discussed so as to\nimplement the proposed EIS control appropriately for fast\nfault current suppression.\nAcknowledgements This work was supported in part by National\nNatural Science Foundation of China (No. 51507126) and in part by\nNational Key Research and Development Program of China (No.\n2016YFB0901903).\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Crea-\ntive Commons Attribution 4.0 International License ( http://\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted\nuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give\nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link\nto the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.\nAppendix A\nThe bidirectional power electronic switches connected\nto E2, E3 and E4 can make different combinations of\nwinding topologies with different impedances; the switches\nin red are ‘‘on’’, and switches with ‘‘off’’ state are not\nplotted.\nSee Fig. A1 and Table A1.\n1\n2\n6\n9\n10\nE3\nE4\nE2\n5\nTo BT\nMode T=0\n9\n10\n2\n3\n8\n5\nE3\nE4\nE2\nMode T=2\nTo BT\nFig. A1 Two typical operation modes with their corresponding on/\noff status of twelve bidirectional power electronic switches\n830 Jun LIU et al.\n123\nReferences\n[1] Sarmiento HG, Castellanos R, Pampin G et al (2003) An\nexample in controlling short circuit levels in a large\nmetropolitan area.
