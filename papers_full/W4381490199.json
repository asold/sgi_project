  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to develop a scale for measuring lifelong learning skills in both young and adult individuals. A total of 275 participants, ranging in age from 14 to 55, took part in the study. The first step in creating the scale item pool involved conducting a thorough literature review. Existing scales related to the subject were examined, and based on these findings, an initial 18-item form was developed. The scale item pool was then presented to two experts who are academicians in the field of lifelong learning, as well as a scale development expert. Their input was taken into account, resulting in corrections and refinements to the scale trial form. Following this, the revised scale trial form was administered to the participants. To assess the construct validity of the scale, an exploratory factor analysis was conducted. This analysis revealed that 7 items needed to be removed from the scale. Ultimately, the scale was found to consist of five factors. The first factor included 5 items, while the remaining factors consisted of 3 items each. Next, a confirmatory factor analysis was performed to determine the relationships between the factors, the relationships between the variables and the factors, the relationships between the factors themselves, and the degree to which the factors explained the model. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient for the scale was found to be .646. Based on these results, the Lifelong Learning Motivation Scale (LLMSS) was developed to address the existing gap in the literature and provide a useful tool for future research and applications related to lifelong learning.",

As a result of this change, the age we are \nin is called the ‘information age’. “Knowledge has become a superior economic resource, more important than \ngoods and often more important than money. Information and knowledge, which are considered as economic \ngoods, are now more important than cars, oil, steel or other products of the industrial age” (Ata, 2006). Thanks \nto technological tools such as the Internet, the breadth and depth of information has increased. The effects of \nthis change on the people needed by society are inevitable. That is why nowadays almost all students take a \ncourse outside school and many adults attend courses and certificate programmes for various knowledge and \nskills. Therefore, the concepts of education and learning are no longer the concern of educators only, but have \nbecome more relevant to the general public than ever before. At this point some questions arise. These are: - \nHow can we create autonomous (continuous, stimulating and resource -rich) learning environments that \ndevelop learners ’ abilities? - How can we create lifelong learning environments in which cog nitive and \npsychological conditions are favourable to the development of learners’ achievement and personal autonomy \n(Derrick, 2003). \nToday, the aim of education is to ensure that individuals become individuals with active adaptation \ncapacities that will carry the society beyond its current level and be the change itself, rather than unquestioning \ncompliance with environmental conditions and remaining as they are (Yeşilyaprak, 2010). Obligations such as \nadapting to change, not being indifferent to change, a nd moving oneself and the society forward have \ninvalidated the limitation of education only to schools in terms of space and years covering basic education in \nterms of time. This has led to the birth and development of the concept of lifelong learning. \nKulich (1982) defined lifelong learning as the provision of education to individuals throughout their \nlives, while White (1982) saw it as the acquisition of the knowledge necessary for individuals to manage their \nlives (Günüç, S., Kuzu, A., & Odabaşı, H. 2012). In other words, lifelong learning refers to various activities \ncarried out for learning from birth to death. \nIn the ‘Strategy Document on Lifelong Learning in Turkey ’ prepared by the Ministry of National \nEducation and approved by the High Planning Council on 5 June 2009, lifelong learning is defined as ‘all kinds \nof learning activities in which individuals participate throughout their lives in order to improve their \nknowledge, skills, interests and competences in personal, social, community and professional fields’. \nToday, lifelong learning is a contemporary phenomenon that constitutes the guiding element of \neducational policies. In order to analyse this phenomenon in all its aspects, it is necessary to define it \nconceptually and to determine what is unde rstood and attributed to it. The terminology and definition of \nlifelong learning have changed within various systems and due to social, psychological and economic \ninfluences. Based on these changes, it is possible to draw a general picture of lifelong lear ning. “The reason \nwhy almost all of the educational experiences usually referred to as lifelong learning/education practices are \nadult education activities is due to the ambiguity of the dividing lines between the concepts of adult education \nand lifelong l earning/education. However, at the point where lifelong learning/education discussions have \nreached, it is stated that the concept has a broader content summarised as “from cradle to grave ”, which \nincludes restructuring at all levels of education systems, and although it includes the dissemination and \ndevelopment of adult education practices, this concept cannot be reduced to this” (Bağcı, 2007). \nThe four main objectives of lifelong learning are learning to know, learning to do, learning to be and \nlearning to live together. Learning is understood as acquiring knowledge from different sources and using this \nknowledge in problem solving, planning or decision making phases of everyday life; it is also understood as \nusing the computer as a tool to access information. Lifelong learning requires specific skills such as supporting \nlearning and organising the learning process itself. In order to realise lifelong learning, literacy skills such as \ninformation literacy, digital literacy and media literacy are needed to acquire, process, assimilate and evaluate \nnew knowledge and skills. Lifelong learning involves questioning one’s environment, knowledge, skills and \nJournal of Teacher Education and Lifelong Learning Volume: 5 Issue: 1 2023\n431 \ninteractions, as well as exploring and appreciating new ideas to gain a new perspective. It develops the ability \nto use the mind actively (Edwards, 2008). \nWhen the studies conducted in Turkey are examined, lifelong learning dispositions in university students \n(Demirel & Coşkun, 2012), prospective teachers (Tatlısu, 2016, Erdoğan, 2014), educational administrator s \n(Gürkan, 2017), adult employees (Babanlı, 2018) and graduate students (Adabaş, 2016) samples were \naddressed. Lifelong learning tendency (Gür Erdoğan & Arsal, 2016; Diker Coşkun, 2009; Yaman, 2014), \nattitude (Karaca, Çalışkan, Dönmez, & Durak, 2021), perc eption (Ünal & Kalçık, 2017),  online interaction \n(Kara, Kukul & Çakır, 2021),  skill (Çiftcibaşı, Korkmaz, & Karamustafaoğlu, 2020) and competence \n(Uzunboylu & Hürsen, 2011) were also addressed in the scales developed. In this study, the motivation \nvariable, which is one of the necessary conditions for learning, is discussed. A scale was developed aiming to \nreveal the motivation status of lifelong learners. \nTherefore, this study aims to examine the digital well-being of individuals. Depending on this purpose, \nthe following sub-objectives will be sought: \n➔ What is the construct validity of the Motivation for Lifelong Learning Scale?\n➔ What is the reliability of the Lifelong Learning Motivation Scale?\n➔ What is the level of lifelong learning motivation of the participants?\nMETHOD \nThis research is a scale development study. The processes applied in the validity and reliability study \nof the Lifelong Learning Motivation (LLMS) Scale and the characteristics of the research group are\npresented below. \nResearch Design \nThis study, which aims to develop a valid and reliable scale to determine the cognitive, affective and \npsychomotor motivation of a lifelong learner, was conducted in a descriptive survey model. Descriptive survey \nmodel is a research model that serves to  describe the  situations that have been experienced or  are  being \nexperienced as they are (Karasar, 2007) and summarises the characteristics of the collected data (Büyüköztürk, \nÇakmak, Akgün, Karadeniz, & Demirel, 2017). For this reason, the survey model was used in this study. \nResearch Universe and Sample \nWhile creating the item pool,  87 sentences were written in  total. Overlapping, distancing from  the \ndefinition framework, etc. were taken into consideration and as a result, it was decided to include 31 items in \nthe item pool. As a result of the opinions of educational technology, psychological counsellor and language \nexperts, it  was  decided to  include 18  items  in  the pilot application. In  scale  development studies, it  is \nrecommended that it would be correct to reach at least 10 times the number  of participants in the item pool \n(Korkmaz, Usta, & Kurt, 2014). Research data were obtained from 275 participants in the first half of 2023. \nThe demographic information of the participants is presented in the table below. \nTable 1. Demographic data \nGender Male Female Total \n14-24 years 25 28 53 \n25-34 years 30 47 77 \n35-44 years 52 35 87 \n45-55 years 28 30 58 \nTOTAL 135 140 275 \nJournal of Teacher Education and Lifelong Learning Volume: 5 Issue: 1 2023\n432 \nEstablishing the Item Pool \nThe European Framework of Key Competences for Lifelong Learning has identified eight key \ncompetences that need to be developed for personal success, active citizenship, social inclusion and \nemployment in the knowledge society (European Commission, 2007; as cited in Beycioğlu & Konan, 2008). \nIn the first step of the scale development process, the relevant literature was analysed in a wide range (Bryce \n2006; Knapper & Cropley, 2000) including skills, perceptions, attitudes, dispositions and knowledge variables. \nThe item pool was started to be formed by considering many dimensions, especially the items in the \nscales. The researchers wrote 87 sentences for all dimensions. 31 items were included in the item pool, and 31 \nitems were kept in the pool as a result of the pilot study and new expert opinion. After the necessary \narrangements were made, the scale form consisting of 18 items (14 positive and 4 negative) was made ready \nfor the actual application. The scale was coded on a 5-point Likert scale with the premises of fully reflects (5), \nreflects a lot (4), reflects moderately (3), reflects a little (2) and does not reflect at all (1) for pos itive items; \nnegative items were coded in the opposite way. \nData Analysis \nDuring the development of the scale, SPSS and AMOS software were used to analyse the data. Principal \ncomponent analysis was used to determine the construct validity and factor loadings of the scale developed to \nmeasure the motivation of lifelong learners (Büyüköztürk, 2002). In case of suitability for factor analysis, \nKaiser- Meyer- Olkin (KMO) coefficient and Barlett Sphericity test results were examined. In the exploratory \nfactor analysis (EFA), 18 items, 4 of which were negative, were coded and factor loadings of 0.40 and above \nwere applied to examine the suitability of the items to the selected model (Büyüköztürk, 2002). Therefore, this \nlower limit was determined as 0.40 in this st udy. Eigenvalue and scree plot were analysed to determine the \nnumber of factors. With 11 items, item discriminations were analysed by independent sample t-test. In addition, \nthe significance of the 27% lower and upper group item scores were analysed to see  how the scale items \naffected the motivation levels of individuals. The validity of the scale consisting of 11 items in total was \nensured. After the exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis was performed. Some value ranges \n(CFI, GFI, RMSEA, AGFI, NFI) were taken into consideration to verify the acceptability of the scale (Byrne, \n2011; Çokluk, 2014). \nInternal consistency coefficient was calculated for the reliability of the scale. Crobach alpha, Guttmann \nsplit-half, Sperman-Brown values were analysed for internal consistency coefficient. \nFINDINGS  \nFindings Related to Validity \nThe construct validity and item discrimination values of the lifelong learning motivation scale were \ncalculated. The results obtained are as follows. \nConstruct Validity \nFindings Related to Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA): The KMO coefficient and Barlett ’s test are \nused to determine whether exploratory factor analysis should be performed. KMO coefficient greater than 0.60 \nand Barlett’s test being significant (p<0.05) indicate that the data are suitable for factor analysis (Büyüköztürk, \n2002). KMO= 0.712 and Barlett’s test χ2= 745.00 sd= 55 (p= 0.000). As a result of the analysis, a structure \nconsisting of 5 dimensions was obtained. Item loadings were analysed and items with loadings lower than 0.40 \nwere not included in the analysis. Care was taken to ensure that the content validity was not impaired, and the \nfactor loadings were re-examined according to the difference of 0.1 between the factor  loadings for overlap \ncontrol. As a result, it was determined that the items were grouped under 3 factors and explained 49.72% of \nthe total variance. Accordingly, the distribution of factor eigenvalues is given in Graph 1. \nJournal of Teacher Education and Lifelong Learning Volume: 5 Issue: 1 2023\n433 \nFigure 1. Slope Slope Graph \nTable 2 shows the exploratory factor analysis. As seen in the table, a three-factor structure dimension \nwas analysed.

When we look at the whole scale for this factor, it is seen that the eigenvalue is 1.738. It is \nseen that it has the power to explain 15.800% o f the overall variance. The second factor of the scale has 3 \nitems. The factor loadings are in the range of 0.403-0.767, the eigenvalue is 1.360 and the variance is 17.362. \nThe third factor consists of 2 items. Factor loadings are in the range of 0.456 -0.546. The eigenvalue of the \nfactor is 1.283 and its variance is 16.558%. \nFindings Related to Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA): As a result of the exploratory factor analysis, \na scale consisting of 11 items with 3 factors was obtained. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using \nAMOS software with the data obtained from the analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to determine \nthe relationship between factors, the relationship between variables and factors, and the level of explanation \nof factors to the model (Brown, 2015). \nTable 3.

According to these results, when the fit index \nvalues of the CFA model established with 275 data were examined, it was determined that the scale exhibited \nan excellent fit with a chi -square value of 2.212 (Byrne, 2013). When the RMSEA value is examined, it is \nbelow the criti cal value, indicating that it is within the acceptable fit index range (Schermelleh -Engel, \nMoosbrugger, & Müller, 2003). When the remaining GFI, AGFI, CFI and NFI values are examined, it is seen \nthat they exhibit acceptable fit according to the critical values (Marsh, Balla & Mcdonald, 1988; Byrne, 2013). \nItem Discrimination \nIn the method of calculating the discrimination power of the scale items, the results obtained from the \nindividual items are sorted from largest to smallest and the lower 27% and upper 27% groups are found. At \nthis stage, independent sample t -test analysis was applied with the lower and upper groups and the t values \nindicating the discrimination powers are shown in Table 4. \nTable 4.

The total t-value of the scale was -42.054 and \nthe results were found to be significant (p<0.001). Accordingly, it can be stated that the discrimination level \nof the scale is high. \nJournal of Teacher Education and Lifelong Learning Volume: 5 Issue: 1 2023\n435 \nItem factor correlations \nItem-total correlation method was used to find out the level of serving the purpose of the items. The \nitem-factor correlation values of the items are given in Table 5. \nTable 4.

Each item was found to have a positive and significant relationship with the whole scale (p<0.001). \nAccording to this result, considering the item factor correlation values, it is seen that each item in the scale \nserves the purpose. \nFindings Regarding the Reliability of the Scale \nIn order to calculate the reliability of the scale, the following analysis results were examined. \nInternal Consistency Level \nSpearman Brown, Cronbach’s Alpha and Guttmann Split-Half coefficients were examined for the five \nfactors and the whole scale. Table 6 shows the reliability coefficients. \nTable 5.

It can be said that \nthe reliability coefficients of the scale on item basis and in its entirety are within the appropriate value range \n(Eroğlu, 2008; Kline, 1994). Accordingly, it can be concluded that the items and the whole scale are reliable \nand consistent. \nDISCUSSION, CONCLUSION, RECOMMENDATIONS \nIn \nthis study, a  scale  for measuring lifelong learning motivation was  developed and  a  validity and \nreliability study was conducted. As a result of the research conducted in this direction, the Lifelong \nLearning Motivation Scale (LLMS) consisting of 3 factors and 11 items was developed. The first factor \nconsists of 5 items and the other two factors consist of 3 items each. \nThe scale was  prepared in  a  5-point  Likert scale.  Positive items  were coded  with  the  premises of \ncompletely reflects (5), very reflects (4), moderately reflects (3), slightly reflects (2) and not reflects at all (1); \nnegative items were coded in the opposite way. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a five-dimensional scale. \nIn the process of factor allocation, items with factor loadings greater than 0.40 were assigned to the factors. In \nthe construct  validity  analysis  stage, factor loadings,  variance  explanatory  power  and  eigenvalues  were \nanalyzed and as a result, it was seen that the construct validity of the scale was at an appropriate level. After \nthe exploratory factor analysis revealed that the scale consisted of five factors, confirmatory factor analysis \nJournal of Teacher Education and Lifelong Learning Volume: 5 Issue: 1 2023\n436 \nwas conducted to confirm the factor structures. As a result of the confirmatory factor analysis, it was seen that \nthe scale model was confirmed by the data. The validity and reliability studies of the scale were conducted \nwith 275 individuals between the ages of 14 -55. The reliability analysis of the scale was examined with \nSpearman Brown, Guttman split -half and Cronbach ’s alpha values. These values show that the scale can \nprovide reliable measurements (Büyüköztürk, 2002). As a result of the independent samples t-test conducted \nto determine the difference between the upper and lower 27% groups in item discrimination, the discrimination \nof the scale items and the entire scale is high. With this scale, it is thought that a measurement tool measuring \nlifelong learning motivation has been introduced to the literature. Today, one of the attitudes required from \nstudents in primary, secondary and higher education is li felong learning. In a way, we can say that our \neducation system is shaped on the basis of this phenomenon. However, this process needs to be examined in \nmore detail in terms of adult design in order to shed light on all learning activities. Ertürk (1979) l isted the \nbasic questions that educators who develop curricula should answer and stated that efficient educational \nexperiences can be organized to the extent that these questions can be answered. In this sense, the aim is to \nexamine lifelong learning with curriculum development methods and to offer suggestions for the identification, \norganization and evaluation of effective educational experiences. In this way, new programs can be developed \nmore effectively. Curriculum development is defined as a set of dynamic relationships between the objectives, \ncontent, teaching-learning processes and evaluation elements of an educational program (Demirel, 2004). At \nthis point, how all components of an educational program will be structured according to the lifelong learning \napproach gains importance. \nLifelong learning is a characteristic that students need to develop throughout their educational life. \nUniversity education is not sufficient to acquire this characteristic. For this reason, the philosophy of lifelong \nlearning should be taken as a basis at all levels of education, starting from pre-school education, and ‘learning \nto learn’ should be essential. “Learning to learn”, “using learning resources effectively”, “setting and achieving \nlearning goals”, “valuing knowledge and personal development”. These educational experiences should be part \nof the basic practices of national education rather than slogans. Lifelong learning should not be perceived as a \nnew teaching method. It should be adopted as the philosophy of all educational environments where ‘learning’ \ntakes place. \nREFERENCES \nAdabaş, A. (2016).
