  "abstract": "In recent years, many incidents have been reported where machine learning\\nmodels exhibited discrimination among people based on race, sex, age, etc.\\nResearch has been conducted to measure and mitigate unfairness in machine\\nlearning models. For a machine learning task, it is a common practice to build\\na pipeline that includes an ordered set of data preprocessing stages followed\\nby a classifier. However, most of the research on fairness has considered a\\nsingle classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the\\npreprocessing stages in machine learning pipeline? Furthermore, studies showed\\nthat often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather\\nthan the model. But no research has been conducted to measure the unfairness\\ncaused by a specific transformation made in the data preprocessing stage. In\\nthis paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the\\nfairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged\\nexisting metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages. Then we\\nconducted a detailed fairness evaluation of the preprocessing stages in 37\\npipelines collected from three different sources. Our results show that certain\\ndata transformers are causing the model to exhibit unfairness. We identified a\\nnumber of fairness patterns in several categories of data transformers.\\nFinally, we showed how the local fairness of a preprocessing stage composes in\\nthe global fairness of the pipeline. We used the fairness composition to choose\\nappropriate downstream transformer that mitigates unfairness in the machine\\nlearning pipeline.\\n",
