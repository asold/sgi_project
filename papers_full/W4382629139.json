  "abstract": "With the remarkable success of change detection (CD) in remote sensing images in the context of deep learning, many convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been proposed. In the current research, to obtain a better context modeling method for remote sensing images and to capture more spatiotemporal characteristics, several attention-based methods and transformer (TR)-based methods have been proposed. Recent research has also continued to innovate on TR-based methods, and many new methods have been proposed. Most of them require a huge number of calculation to achieve good results. Therefore, using the TR-based mehtod while maintaining the overhead low is a problem to be solved. Here, we propose a GNN-based multi-scale transformer siamese network for remote sensing image change detection (GMTS) that maintains a low network overhead while effectively modeling context in the spatiotemporal domain. We also design a novel hybrid backbone to extract features. Compared with the current CNN backbone, our backbone network has a lower overhead and achieves better results. Further, we use high/low frequency (HiLo) attention to extract more detailed local features and the multi-scale pooling pyramid transformer (MPPT) module to focus on more global features respectively. Finally, we leverage the context modeling capabilities of TR in the spatiotemporal domain to optimize the extracted features. We have a relatively low number of parameters compared to that required by current TR-based methods and achieve a good effect improvement, which provides a good balance between efficiency and performance.",
