    "abstract": "Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy due to its ease of understanding and deployment in engineered robot architectures. However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in real-world, highly dynamic, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance in planning domains where action effects may not be immediate, or when frequent re-planning is needed due to changed circumstances in the robot workspace. The validity of plans in the long term, plan length, and planning time could hinder the robot's efficiency and negatively affect the overall human-robot interaction's fluency. We present a framework, which we refer to as Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs' response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the output, instead of super-linearly as in the case of symbolic task planners, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of end-to-end, and to make each action available for execution as soon as it is generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn enables concurrent planning and execution. In the past year, significant efforts have been devoted by the research community to evaluate the overall cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to providing an overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities in other metrics, specifically those related to their short- and mid-term generative capabilities, which are used to build a look-ahead predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000 samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by up to 61.4%.",
