Therefore, no ethical approval is required. After the \npublication of this protocol and the conduct of the review, \nits results are going to be published in an open access \njournal dedicated to biomedical informatics/digital health.\nINTRODUCTION\nDiagnostic tests, such as many types of radio-\nlogical imaging, are the basis for decision-\n \nmaking in \nmodern medicine1: For example, \n74.5% of Austrian women aged 50–69 years \nhave received bilateral mammography \nduring the timeframe of 2 years according \nto the Austrian Health Interview Survey in \n2019.\n2 With breast cancer being the ‘second \nmost common malignancy in the world’, 3 \nmammography shows to reduce the risk of \nbreast cancer mortality of women aged 50–69 \nyears with high certainty. This risk reduction \nis based on the treatment decisions that are \nin turn based on radiology reports, where \nexperts describe the findings from the images. \nTraditionally, radiologists create semistruc-\ntured free-\n text radiology reports describing \nfindings \nand their interpretation based on \nacquired images. Structured reporting, on \nthe other hand, aims at improving clinical \noutcomes and standardisation by providing \nframeworks for report layouts and contents. \nHowever, implementing structured reporting \noften requires changes to existing clinical \nprocesses. A consequent temporary increase \nin workload for radiologists makes it difficult \nto transfer structured reporting into clinical \npractice due to resistance among clinicians.\n4 \nExisting information could be made avail-\nable by extracting clinically relevant informa-\ntion including its semantics and relations by \napplying natural language processing (NLP) \nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY\n ⇒ This scoping review protocol strictly adheres to \nstandardised guidelines for scoping review conduc-\ntion, including the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis \nand the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic \nReviews and Meta-\n Analyses Extension for Scoping \nReviews (PRISMA-\n ScR) guideline.\n ⇒ The search strategy comprises four databases: \nPubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science Core Collection \nand ACM Digital Library.\n ⇒ This scoping review will close the knowledge gap \npresent in the field of information extraction (IE) \nfrom radiology reports caused by the recent rapid \ntechnical progress.\n ⇒ According to the nature of a scoping review, identi-\nfied sources of evidence are not critically appraised.\n ⇒ The results of the scoping review will serve as a ba-\nsis for defining further research directions regarding \nIE from radiology reports.\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . by guest on November 5, 2025 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/Downloaded from 9 December 2023. 10.1136/bmjopen-2023-076865 on BMJ Open: first published as \n2\nReichenpfader D, et al. BMJ Open 2023;13:e076865. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-076865\nOpen access  \nmethods. NLP is defined as the ‘tract of artificial intel-\nligence and linguistics, devoted to making computers \nunderstand the statements or words written in human \nlanguages’.\n5 The extracted information could be made \navailable for secondary use purposes, for example, for \nprediction or research, based on methods related to \ninformation extraction (IE).\nIE is a subfield within NLP to extract relevant infor -\nmation from text. Subtasks of IE include among \nothers, named entity recognition, relation extraction \nand template filling. To solve these subtasks, different \napproaches might be applied: Basic approaches are based \non heuristics. Machine learning-\n based approaches, on \nthe contrar\ny, include traditional methods (eg, support \nvector machine, Naïve Bayes), or methods based on \ndeep learning. Deep learning, in turn, comprises, among \nothers, recurrent and convolutional neural networks \nas well as—most recently developed—large language \nmodels (LLMs).\n6\nLLMs are ‘deep learning models with a huge number \nof parameters trained in an unsupervised way on large \nvolumes of text’.\n7 We narrow this definition and only \nregard models with at least one million parameters as \nLLMs. Most of today’s models are based on the trans-\nformer architecture, which was first described in 2017.\n8 \nSince then, new LLMs have been published on an ongoing \nbasis, being trained on growing datasets and surpassing \nstate-\n \nof-\n \nresearch performance regularly. Well-\n \nknown \nmodels include BERT (2018) 9, Megatron-  ML (2019) 10, \nGPT-\n \n3 (2020)11, GPT- 4 and PaLM 2 (2023)12 13.\nRegarding existing literature concerning IE from \nradiology reports, several reviews are available, although \nthese sources either miss to include current developments \nor only focus on a specific aspect or clinical domain. The \napplication of NLP to radiology reports for IE has already \nbeen subject to two systematic reviews in 2016\n14 and \n2021.15 While the former is not freely available, the latter \nsearches only Google Scholar and includes only one study \nbased on LLMs. More recent reviews include a specific \nscoping review on the application of NLP to reports, \nspecifically related to breast cancer\n16 and a systematic \nreview on the application of deep learning-\n based \nNLP \nmethods in radiology, although this only includes sources \nof evidence (SOE) up to 2019.\n17 Recent studies have \nbeen conducted on deep learning methods, including \nthose based on architectures such as bidirectional long \nshort-\n term memor\ny, recurrent neural network and gated \nrecurrent unitarchitectures.18–20\nA search in PROSPERO, conducted on 30 May 2023, \nwith the search query ‘Natural Language Processing \nAND radiology’ yielded 12 results. Eleven results are \nnot related to IE from radiology reports. One registered \nreview describes named entity recognition and relation \nextraction in clinical documents using NLP. However, this \nreview is neither focused on radiology reports nor LLM, \nand the search process was last updated on 7 July 2021, \npotentially missing many of the recently published articles \nregarding the application of LLMs.\n21 Therefore, as LLMs \nhave only recently gained momentum, a research gap \nexists and there is no overview of LLM-\n based \napproaches \nto IE from radiology reports available.\nAs compared with a systematic review, a scoping review \nusually does not include a critical appraisal of the iden-\ntified SOE. On the other hand, conducting a scoping \nreview takes fewer resources to perform and is therefore \nespecially suitable for the dynamically changing research \narea focused on IE from radiology reports. With this \nprotocol for a scoping review, we therefore intend to \nfill the identified research gap and answer the following \nresearch question:\nWhat is the state of research regarding information extraction \nfrom free-\n text radiology r\neports based on LLMs?\nTable 1 Resear ch subquestions to be answered based on the scoping review\nRQ.01—Performance What is the performance of LLMs for information extraction from radiology reports?\nRQ.02—Training and modelling Which models are used and how is the pretraining and fine-\n tuning pr\nocess designed?\nRQ.03—Use cases Which modalities and anatomical regions do the analysed reports correspond to?\nRQ.04—Data and annotation How much data was used to train the model, how was the annotation process designed \nand is the data publicly available?\nRQ.05—Challenges What are open challenges and common limitations of existing approaches?\nLLMs, large language models.\nTable 2 Inclusion criteria\nC.01 The full-  text SOE is r etrievable.\nC.02 The SOE was published after 31 December 2017.\nC.03 The SOE is published in a peer-\n r\neviewed journal \nor conference proceeding.\nC.04 The SOE describes original research, excluding \nreviews, comments, patents and white papers.\nC.05 The SOE describes the application of NLP \nmethods for the purpose of IE from free-\n text \nradiology r\neports.\nC.06 The described approach is LLM-\n based (defined \nas deep lear\nning models with more than one \nmillion parameters, trained on unlabelled text \ndata).\nIE, information extraction; LLM, large language model; NLP , natural \nlanguage processing; SOE, sources of evidence.\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . by guest on November 5, 2025 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/Downloaded from 9 December 2023. 10.1136/bmjopen-2023-076865 on BMJ Open: first published as \n3\nReichenpfader D, et al. BMJ Open 2023;13:e076865. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-076865\nOpen access\nSpecifically, we are interested in the subquestions that \narise from the posed research question, see table\n \n1.\nThe objective of this scoping review protocol is to \nanswer the above-\n mentioned aspects, give an over\nview \nof recent developments, identify main trends and guide \nfuture research by showing open challenges and limita-\ntions of current approaches.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS\nThe scoping review will adhere to the JBI Manual for \nEvidence Synthesis, chapter 11: Scoping reviews.\n22 This \nmanual in turn complies with the specifications of the \nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and \nMeta-\n Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA) \nExtension for Scoping Reviews, which provides a guide\n-\nline on the design and methodology of a scoping review.23 \nThe completed PRISMA Protocols checklist is available as \nan online supplemental file.\nThis protocol is designed specifically based on chapter \n11.2 of the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis: ‘Develop-\nment of a scoping review protocol’. The manual defines \nsections and their contents to be included in the protocol, \ncomprising inclusion criteria, search strategy, source \nof evidence selection, data extraction, analysis of the \nevidence and presentation of results. These aspects are \ndescribed in the following chapters.\nInclusion criteria\nIn table\n \n2, we describe the criteria to be applied in \nselecting SOE. Focus was put on aligning these criteria \nwith the title as well as the research question and subques-\ntions of the scoping review.\nSearch strategy\nThe chosen search strategy comprises three steps: First, \na limited search of at least two databases (PubMed and \nGoogle Scholar) is used to obtain a list of relevant index \nterms and keywords, see table\n \n3. Next, based on this list \nof terms, a comprehensive and systematic search query is \ndeveloped iteratively.\nWe include four databases to be searched using the \ndeveloped query: PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science \nCore Collection and ACM Digital Library. The search \nquery will be initially designed for use in PubMed and \nthen adapted for compatibility with the other three data-\nbases, with the aim of automating this process wherever \npossible.\n24 The full draft search strategy for this database \n(PubMed) is documented in an online supplemental file. \nEach search will include all indexed SOE from the incep-\ntion of the database to 1 August 2023. Each of the four \nsearch strings, including the number of retrieved records, \ndate coverage and date of search, will be documented \nusing a standardised template provided by the Karolinska \nInstitutet.\n25\nAs a third and last step, after the selection process, \nreference lists of studies that are included in the review \nare searched for additional SOE (‘forward search’). This \nprocess might be supported by automation tools.\nSource of evidence selection\nThe SOE selection process will be conducted by two \nreviewers individually. The review process is performed \nand managed using the software platform Rayyan.\n26 \nBefore screening, duplicate records are removed semi-\nautomatically (manual check of automatically identified \nduplicates) and a pilot testing procedure is carried out to \nensure agreement of both reviewers on inclusion criteria: \nA random sample of 25 SOE entries is selected and \nassessed by both reviewers. Then, decisions are compared. \nIn case of any differences, inclusion criteria are clarified \nand/or adapted. Screening is started only when an agree-\nment of >75% is achieved—otherwise, additional batches \nof 10 SOE entries are assessed similarly until the specified \nlevel of agreement is reached.\nNext, all records, consisting of titles and abstracts, are \nscreened by both reviewers and included if they fulfil \nall inclusion criteria. After completion, disagreements \nTable 3 Primary sear ch terms\nPubMed (information extraction) AND (radiolog*) AND (report*) AND (large language model)\nGoogle Scholar ‘information extraction radiology reports large language model’\nFigure 1 Sour ce of evidence selection process.\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n . by guest on November 5, 2025 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/Downloaded from 9 December 2023. 10.1136/bmjopen-2023-076865 on BMJ Open: first published as \n4\nReichenpfader D, et al.

Then, \nfull-\n text \nretrieval is performed for all included records. \nRecords that cannot be retrieved are excluded. Retrieved \nfull texts are assessed for eligibility: Sources that do not \ncomply with all defined inclusion criteria are excluded. \nLast, a forward search is performed using reference lists \nof remaining SOE. See figure\n \n1 for an illustration of the \ndescribed process.\nData extraction\nAs a next step, key information is extracted from the \nfinal set of included studies. A charting table was created \nbased on the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, Appendix \n11.1, and adapted as well as augmented in accordance \nwith the research question and subquestions this scoping \nreview addresses, see box\n \n1.22 Before extraction, a pilot \ntest is conducted first to ensure the validity of the data \ncharting table: Two SOE are extracted by two reviewers \neach. Results and possible adaptions of the charting table \nare discussed and agreed on. Upon agreement, data \nextraction is performed by one reviewer.\nAnalysis of the evidence and presentation of results\nAnalysis of evidence is limited to descriptive mapping and \ndoes not include synthesis or critical appraisal. Aspects \ndescribed in the data charting table are described by \nfrequency counts where possible. These frequencies \nprovide the basis to answer the research subquestions \ndescribed in table\n \n1. The results are presented using \neither tables, lists, cross tabulations, bar charts, pie charts \nor other diagram types. Diagrams and tables are accom-\npanied by descriptive texts.\nPatient and public involvement statement\nNone.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION\nThis scoping review protocol does not include any \nresearch with or related to humans, animals or their data, \nhence no ethical approval is sought for. After the publi-\ncation of the protocol, the scoping review itself is carried \nout. Its results are then published in an open access \njournal dedicated to the field of biomedical informatics. \nAny changes to this protocol will be documented in the \noutcome document, including the date of the change \nand a justification for it.\nContributors DR:  Guarantor, conceptualisation, methodology and writing—original \ndraft.
