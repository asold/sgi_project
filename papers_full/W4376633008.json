ACM, New York, NY, USA, 7 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3604915.\n3608860\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe great development of Large Language Models (LLMs) [12, 30,\n34, 40] can extend channels for information seeking, i.e., interact-\ning with LLMs to acquire information like ChatGPT [3, 5, 20, 41].\nThe revolution of LLM has also formed a new paradigm of recom-\nmendations which makes recommendations through the language\ngeneration of LLMs according to user instructions [7, 14]. Figure 1\nillustrates some examples under this Recommendation via LLM (Re-\ncLLM) paradigm, e.g., users give instructions like “Provide me 20\nsong titles ...? ” and LLM returns a list of 20 song titles.\nHowever, directly using LLM for recommendation may raise\nconcerns about fairness. Previous work has shown that LLMs tend\nto reinforce social biases in their generation outputs due to the\nbias in the large pre-training corpus, leading to unfair treatment\nof vulnerable groups [ 4, 13, 19]. Fairness is also a critical crite-\nrion of recommendation systems due to their enormous social im-\npact [10, 24, 29, 38]. Despite the tremendous amount of analysis on\nthe fairness issue of conventional recommendation systems [24, 38],\nfairness in RecLLM has not been explored. It is essential to bridge\nthis research gap to avoid the potential risks of applying RecLLM.\nIn this paper, we analyze the fairness of RecLLM w.r.t. the sen-\nsitive attribute of users. Some users may choose not to disclose\ncertain sensitive attributes such asskin color and race due to privacy\nconcerns [11, 27] when giving instruction for generating recom-\nmended results (Figure 1). Hiding sensitive attributes may result\nin unfairness on the user side since the LLM has a preference for a\nspecific attribute based on its training data. For instance, Figure 1\nshows that the recommendation results without sensitive attributes\nprovided are biased towards some specific user groups, leading to\narXiv:2305.07609v3  [cs.IR]  17 Oct 2023\nRecSys ’23, September 18–22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore Jizhi Zhang*, Keqin Bao*, Yang Zhang, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng †, and Xiangnan He†\nUser\nRecLLM\nI am a fan of \nAdele\n.

Specifically, we judge\nfairness by comparing the similarity between the recommended results of different sensitive instructions and the neutral\ninstruction. Under ideal equity, recommendations for sensitive attributes under the same category should be equally similar to\nrecommendations for the neutral instruct. On the right are the sensitive attributes we explored and their specific values.\nunfairness for vulnerable groups. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate\nthe user-side fairness in the RecLLM.\nHowever, directly using the traditional fairness benchmark to\nmeasure the fairness of RecLLM has some problems. In detail, on the\none hand, traditional fairness measurement methods often require\nscores of model prediction results to calculate fairness metrics,\nwhich is difficult to obtain in RecLLM. On the other hand, traditional\nmethods need to calculate fairness on a fixed candidate set based on\nthe specific dataset. Due to the universality of RecLLM, limiting its\noutput range seriously damages its upper limit of recommendation\nability, and can’t really measure its fairness in practical applications.\nTo address these problems, we come up with a Fairness of\nRecommendation via LLM benchmark called FaiRLLM tailored\nspecifically for RecLLM. FaiRLLM evaluates the fairness of RecLLM\nby measuring the similarity between the recommendation results of\nneutral instructions that do not include sensitive attributes andsensi-\ntive instructions that disclose such attributes (as shown in Figure 1).\nIt assesses the fairness of RecLLM by analyzing the divergence of\nsimilarities across different values of the sensitive attributes (e.g.,\nAfrican American, black, white, and yellow in the case of race). In\nparticular, we have defined three metrics for evaluating the simi-\nlarity of two recommendation lists generated by LLMs, which can\naccommodate newly generated items. Moreover, we have created\ndatasets for two common recommendation scenarios, namely music,\nand movies, taking into account eight sensitive attributes, as illus-\ntrated in Figure 1. On these datasets, we have evaluated ChatGPT,\nshowing its unfairness on various sensitive attributes.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n•To our knowledge, this is the first investigation into the fair-\nness issues of the emerging LLM for recommendation paradigm,\npresenting a novel recommendation problem.\n•We build a new FaiRLLM benchmark which includes carefully\ndesigned evaluation methods and datasets in two scenes of rec-\nommendation with consideration of eight sensitive attributes.\n•We extensively evaluate ChatGPT with the FaiRLLM benchmark\nand reveal fairness issues on several sensitive attributes.\n2 RELATED WORK\nIn this section, we briefly discuss the related work on fairness in\nboth the LLM field and in recommendation.\n•Fairness in Large Language Models. Researchers have found\nthat bias in the pretraining corpus can cause LLMs to generate\nharmful or offensive content, such as discriminating against disad-\nvantaged groups. This has increased research focus on the harmful-\nness issues of LLMs, including unfairness. One line of such research\nis aimed at reducing the unfairness of an LLM (as well as other\nharmfulness). For instance, RLHF [30] and RLAIF [6] are used to\nprevent reinforcing existing stereotypes and producing demeaning\nportrayals. Additionally, another emerging research area in the\nNLP community focuses on better evaluating the unfairness and\nother harmfulness of LLMs by proposing new benchmarks. Specific\nexamples include CrowS-Pairs [28], which is a benchmark dataset\ncontaining multiple sentence pairs where one sentence in each pair\nis more stereotyping than the other; RealToxicityPrompts [16] and\nRedTeamingData [13], which are datasets for the prompt genera-\ntion task containing prompts that could induce models to generate\nharmful or toxic responses; and HELM [ 26], which is a holistic\nevaluation benchmark for large language models that evaluates\nboth bias and fairness. Despite the existing research on fairness in\nLLMs in the field of NLP, there is currently no relevant research on\nthe fairness of RecLLM, and this work aims to initially explore this\nfield.\n•Fairness in Recommendation. With increasing concerns about\nthe negative social impact of recommendation systems [29, 32, 33],\nIs ChatGPT Fair for Recommendation? Evaluating Fairness in Large Language Model Recommendation RecSys ’23, September 18–22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\nboth item-side [1, 2] and user-side [ 22, 23, 31] unfairness issues\nin recommendation have received significant attention in recent\nyears [24, 38]. Existing recommendation fairness can be categorized\ninto individual fairness [9, 25, 42] and group fairness [15, 23, 37]. In-\ndividual fairness, such as counterfactual fairness [25], requires that\neach similar individual should be treated similarly [25], while group\nfairness emphasizes fair recommendations at the group level [15].\nConceptually, the investigated fairness for RecLLM can be catego-\nrized as user-side group fairness. However, there is a distinct differ-\nence between our fairness and traditional group fairness: traditional\ngroup fairness is directly defined by the difference in recommen-\ndation results/qualities across different sensitive groups [ 24, 38],\nwhereas we focus on the difference in a specific similarity, namely,\nthe similarity of the sensitive group to the neutral group, across\ndifferent sensitive groups. This difference would further raise dif-\nferent requirements for evaluation methods and metrics, compared\nto the traditional ones.\n3 FAIRLLM BENCHMARK\nWe introduce the fairness evaluation and dataset construction in\nthe FaiRLLM benchmark in §3.1 and §3.2, respectively.\n3.1 Fairness Evaluation in RecLLM\nFairness Definition. As an initial attempt, we focus on the user-\nside fairness in RecLLM. Given a sensitive attribute (e.g., gender) of\nusers, we define the fairness of RecLLM as the absence of any preju-\ndice or favoritism toward user groups with specific values (e.g., female\nand male) of the sensitive attribute when generating recommendations\nwithout using such sensitive information .\n3.1.1 Evaluation Method. The key is to investigate whether Re-\ncLLM exhibits prejudice or favoritism towards specific user groups\nwhen receiving instructions without sensitive information. To de-\ntermine the existence of prejudice or favoritism, we first construct\nthe reference status, i.e., obtaining recommendation results with-\nout sensitive attributes in the user instruction. We then compute\nsimilarities between the reference status and recommendation re-\nsults obtained with specific values of the sensitive attribute, and\ncompare these similarities to quantify the degree of fairness. Let\nA= {𝑎}denote a sensitive attribute where 𝑎 is a specific value\nof the attribute. Note that 𝑎is a word or phrase. Given 𝑀 neutral\nuser instructions, the main steps of our evaluation method for each\ninstruction are as follows:\n•Step 1: Obtain the top-𝐾 recommendations (R𝑚) of each neutral\ninstruction 𝐼𝑚, where 𝑚is the index of instruction;\n•Step 2: Construct sensitive instructions {𝐼𝑎𝑚 }for each value of\nthe sensitive attribute Aby injecting the value 𝑎into the neutral\ninstruction 𝐼𝑚, and obtain the top-𝐾 recommendations of each\nsensitive instructions denoted as {R𝑎𝑚 };\n•Step 3: Compute 𝑆𝑖𝑚(R𝑎𝑚,R𝑚), the similarity between R𝑎𝑚 and\nR𝑚 for each 𝑎 ∈A.\nFor each value 𝑎, we aggregate its similarity scores across all 𝑀\ninstructions as 𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎):= Í\n𝑚 𝑆𝑖𝑚(R𝑎𝑚,R𝑚)/𝑀 and then evaluate\nthe level of unfairness in RecLLM as the divergence of these aggre-\ngated similarities across different values of the sensitive attribute,\n{𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎)|𝑎 ∈A}.\n3.1.2 Benchmark Metrics. To quantify the level of unfairness, we\nintroduce new fairness metrics based on the obtained similarities\n{𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎)|𝑎 ∈A}. We next present the fairness metrics and elaborate\non the utilized similarity metrics.\nFairness metrics. We propose two fairness metrics — Sensitive-to-\nNeutral Similarity Range (𝑆𝑁𝑆𝑅) and Sensitive-to-Neutral Similarity\nVariance (𝑆𝑁𝑆𝑉 ), which quantify the unfairness level by measuring\nthe divergence of {𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎)|𝑎 ∈A} from different aspects. Specifi-\ncally, 𝑆𝑁𝑆𝑅 measures the difference between the similarities of the\nmost advantaged and disadvantaged groups, while𝑆𝑁𝑆𝑉 measures\nthe variance of 𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎)across all possible 𝑎of the studied sensitive\nattribute Ausing the Standard Deviation. Formally, for the top-𝐾\nrecommendation,\n𝑆𝑁𝑆𝑅@𝐾 = max\n𝑎∈A\n𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎)− min\n𝑎∈A\n𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎),\n𝑆𝑁𝑆𝑉 @𝐾 =\nvuut 1\n|A|\n∑︁\n𝑎∈A\n \n𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎)− 1\n|A|\n∑︁\n𝑎′∈A\n𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎′)\n!2\n,\n(1)\nwhere |A|denotes the number of all possible values in the stud-\nied sensitive attribute. For both fairness metrics, a higher value\nindicates greater levels of unfairness.\nSimilarity metrics. Regarding the similarity 𝑆𝑖𝑚(𝑎), we compute\nit using three similarity metrics that can measure the similarity\nbetween two recommendation lists:\n•Jaccard similarity [ 17]. This metric is widely used to measure\nthe similarity between two sets by the ratio of their common\nelements to their total distinct elements. We directly treat a recom-\nmendation list as a set to compute the Jaccard similarity between\nthe neutral group and the sensitive group with the sensitive\nattribute value 𝑎as:\n𝐽𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑@𝐾 = 1\n𝑀\n∑︁\n𝑚\n|R𝑚 ∩R𝑎𝑚 |\n|R𝑚 |+|R 𝑎𝑚 |−|R 𝑚 ∩R𝑎𝑚 |, (2)\nwhere R𝑚, R𝑎𝑚, and 𝑀still have the same means as Section 3.1.1,\n|R𝑚 ∩R𝑎𝑚 |denotes the number of common items between the\nR𝑚 and R𝑎𝑚, similarly for others. Functionally, 𝐽𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑎𝑟𝑑@𝐾 mea-\nsures the average overlapping level of neutral and sensitive rec-\nommendation list pairs, without considering the item ranking\ndifferences.\n•SERP*. This metric is developed based on the SEarch Result\nPage Misinformation Score (SERP-MS) [35], which we modify\nto measure the similarity between two recommendation lists\nwith the consideration of the number of overlapping elements\nand their ranks. Formally, for the top- 𝐾 recommendation, the\nsimilarity between the neutral and the group with a specific value\n𝑎of the sensitive group is computed as:\n𝑆𝐸𝑅𝑃∗@𝐾 = 1\n𝑀\n∑︁\n𝑚\n∑︁\n𝑣∈R𝑎𝑚\nI(𝑣 ∈R𝑚)∗( 𝐾−𝑟𝑎𝑚,𝑣 +1)\n𝐾∗(𝐾+1)/2 , (3)\nwhere 𝑣 represents an item in R𝑎𝑚, 𝑟𝑎𝑚,𝑣 ∈{1,...,𝐾 }represents\nthe rank of the item𝑣in R𝑎𝑚, and I(𝑣 ∈R𝑚)= 1 if 𝑣 ∈R𝑚 is true\nelse 0. This metric can be viewed as a weighted Jaccard similarity,\nwhich further weights items with their ranks in R𝑎𝑚. However,\nit does not consider the relative ranks of two elements, e.g., if\n𝑣1 and 𝑣2 belonging to R𝑎𝑚 both appear in the R𝑚, exchanging\nthem in R𝑎𝑚 would not change the result.\nRecSys ’23, September 18–22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore Jizhi Zhang*, Keqin Bao*, Yang Zhang, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng †, and Xiangnan He†\n•PRAG*. This similarity metric is designed by referencing the\nPairwise Ranking Accuracy Gap metric [8], which could consider\nthe relative ranks between two elements. Formally, the similarity\nbetween the neutral and sensitive groups about the top-𝐾 LLM’s\nrecommendation is computed as:\n𝑃𝑅𝐴𝐺∗@𝐾\n=\n∑︁\n𝑚\n∑︁\n𝑣1,𝑣2 ∈R𝑎𝑚\n𝑣1≠𝑣2\n\u0002\nI (𝑣1 ∈R𝑚)∗I \u0000𝑟𝑚,𝑣1 < 𝑟𝑚,𝑣2\n\u0001 ∗I(𝑟𝑎𝑚,𝑣1 < 𝑟𝑎𝑚,𝑣2 )\n\u0003\n𝐾(𝐾+1)𝑀 ,\n(4)\nwhere I(·)still has similar means as Equation(3), 𝑣1 and 𝑣2 denote\ntwo different recommended items in R𝑎𝑚, and 𝑟𝑎𝑚,𝑣1 (or 𝑟𝑚,𝑣1 )\ndenotes the rank of 𝑣1 in R𝑎𝑚 (or R𝑚). Specifically, if 𝑣1 is not in\nR𝑚, then 𝑟𝑚,𝑣1 = +∞, similarly for 𝑣2. As shown in the equation,\na higher metric does not only require high item overlap but also\nrequires the pairwise ranking order between an item and another\nitem to be the same inR𝑚 and R𝑎𝑚. This allows us to measure the\nagreement of pairwise ranking between recommendation results\nfor the natural and sensitive instructions.\n3.2 Dataset Construction\nRecLLM differs from conventional recommender systems in terms\nof the data requirements for both the model input and fairness eval-\nuation, raising the need of constructing a new benchmark dataset\nthat is suitable for RecLLM fairness evaluation. In this section, we\ndetail how to construct such a new benchmark dataset, beginning\nby presenting the data format and then moving on to the detailed\ndata collection process.\n3.2.1 Data Format. RecLLM usually relies on user instructions\n(i.e., recommendation requests) in natural language, in which the\nuser preference is explicitly expressed, to make recommendations.\nTherefore, the core of constructing a dataset for RecLLM fairness\nevaluation is to collect suitable user instructions. Without losing\ngenerality, we further assume user instructions are expressed fol-\nlowing a fixed template, which includes both the user preference\ninformation and the task information. Specifically, we take the fol-\nlowing template for neutral and sensitive instructions, respectively:\nNetrual: “I am a fan of [names]. Please provide me with a list\nof 𝐾 song/movie titles... ”\nSensitive: “I am a/an [sensitive feature] fan of [names]. Please\nprovide me with a list of 𝐾 song/movie titles... ”,\nwhere “I am a [sensitive feature] fan of [name] ” is used to express\nuser preference, “Please provide me with a list of 𝐾 item titles... ”\ndenotes the task description. With these templates, we can simulate\nusers with different preference by varying the “ [name]” field to\nobtain different neutral instractions, and inject different sensitive\ninformation by varying the “[sensitive feature]” field to construct\ndifferent sensitive instructions. Here, we consider the top-𝐾 recom-\nmendation scenario and take item titles to represent item identities.\n3.2.2 Data Collection. We next select data to fill in the “[names]”\nand “[sensitive feature] ” fields to construct our dataset. To ensure\nthe recommendation validity of RecLLM, we use a selection pro-\ncess designed to increase the likelihood that the LLM has seen\nthe selected data. Specifically, for the “[sensitive feature] ” field, we\nconsider eight commonly discussed sensitive attributes: age, coun-\ntry, gender, continent, occupation, race, religion , and physics. The\npossible values for each attribute are summarized in Figure 1. For\nthe “[names]” field, we choose famous singers of music or famous\ndirectors of movies as potential candidates. Then, we enumerate\nall possible singers/directors, as well as all possible values of the\nsensitive attributes, resulting in two datasets:\n- Music. We first screen the 500 most popular singers on the Mu-\nsic Television platform2 based on The 10,000 MTV’s Top Music\nArtists3. Then, we enumerate all singers and all possible values\nof each sensitive attribute to fill in the “[name]” and “[sensitive\nfeature]” fields, respectively, to construct the music dataset.\n- Movie. First, we utilize the IMDB official API4, one of the most\nreputable and authoritative websites of movie and TV informa-\ntion, to select 500 directors with the highest number of popular\nmovies and TV shows from the IMDB dataset. Popular movies\nand TV shows are defined as those with over 2000 reviews and\nhigh ratings (>7). We then populate the selected directors and all\npossible sensitive attribute values into the corresponding fields\nof our data templates in the enumeration method, resulting in\nthe movie dataset.\n4 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\nIn this section, we conduct experiments based on the proposed\nbenchmark to analyze the recommendation fairness of LLMs by\nanswering the following two questions:\n•RQ1: How unfair is the LLM when serving as a recommender\non various sensitive user attributes?\n•RQ2: Is the unfairness phenomenon for using LLM as a recom-\nmender robust across different cases?\n4.1 Overall Evaluation (RQ1)\nConsidering the representative role of ChatGPT among existing\nLLMs, we take it as an example to study the recommendation fair-\nness of LLMs, using the proposed evaluation method and dataset.\nWe feed each neutral instruction and corresponding sensitive in-\nstruction into ChatGPT to generate top-𝐾 recommendations (𝐾=20\nfor both music and movie data), respectively. And then we compute\nthe recommendation similarities between the neutral (reference)\nand sensitive groups and the fairness metrics. Specifically, when us-\ning ChatGPT to generate the recommendation text, we use ChatGPT\nin a greedy-search manner by fixing the hyperparameters including\ntemperature, top_p, and frequency_penality as zero to ensure the\nreproducibility of the experiments. We summarize the results in\nTable 1 and Figure 2. The table presents fairness metrics, as well as\nmaximal and minimal similarities, where the maximal/minimal sim-\nilarity corresponds to the most advantaged/disadvantaged group,\nrespectively. The figure depicts the similarity of each sensitive\n2https://www.mtv.com/.\n3https://gist.github.com/mbejda/9912f7a366c62c1f296c.\n4https://developer.imdb.com/.\nIs ChatGPT Fair for Recommendation?

Based\non the table and figures, we have made the following observations:\n•For both movie and music recommendations, ChatGPT demon-\nstrates unfairness across the most sensitive attributes. In each\ndataset, each similarity metric exhibits a similar level of values\nover different sensitive attributes ( c.f., Max and Min), but the\ncorresponding fairness metrics (𝑆𝑁𝑆𝑅 and 𝑆𝑁𝑆𝑉 ) exhibit vary-\ning levels of values. This indicates that the degree of unfairness\nvaries across sensitive attributes. In the music dataset, the four\nattributes with the highest value of𝑆𝑁𝑆𝑉 for 𝑃𝑅𝐴𝐺∗are religion,\ncontinent, occupation , and country. In the movie dataset, the four\nattributes are race, country, continent , and religion.\n•As shown in Figure 2, the difference in similarity consistently\npersists when truncating the recommendation list to different\nlengths (𝐾), and the relative order of different values of sensitive\nattributes remains mostly unchanged. This suggests that the issue\nof unfairness persists even when the length of recommendation\nlists is changed. Similar phenomena are observed for the undrawn\nattributes, but we omit them to save space.\n•In most cases, ChatGPT’s disadvantaged groups (i.e., those with\nsmaller values of similarity metrics) regarding different sensitive\nattributes align with the inherent social cognition of the real\nworld. For example, in terms of the attribute —continent, “African”\nis the disadvantaged group. Such unfairness should be minimized\nin the recommendations made by RecLLM.\n4.2 Unfairness Robustness Analyses (RQ2)\nWe analyze the robustness of unfairness, i.e., whether similar un-\nfairness persists when there are typos in sensitive attributes or\nwhen different languages are used for instructions. Due to space\nconstraints, we conduct the robustness analysis on the attribute\n— continent, which is one of the most consistently unfair sensitive\nattributes in Table 1.\n4.2.1 The Influence of Sensitive Attribute Typos. To investigate the\ninfluence of typos in sensitive attributes on the unfairness of Re-\ncLLM, we focus on two values of the attribute —continent: “African”\nand “American”. Specifically, we create four typos by adding or sub-\ntracting letters, resulting in “Afrian”, “Amerian”, “Americcan”, and\n“Africcan”. We then conduct experiments on these typos and the\nright ones and compute their similarity to the neutral group. The\nresults are shown in the left two subfigures of Figure 3. We observe\nthat “Afrian” and “Africcan”, which are closer to the disadvantaged\ngroup “African”, are less similar to the neutral group, exhibiting rel-\natively higher levels of disadvantage. This indicates that the closer a\ntypo is to a vulnerable sensitive value, the more likely it is to result\nin being disadvantaged, highlighting the persistence of unfairness\nin RecLLM.\n4.2.2 The Influence of Language. In addition, we analyze the influ-\nence of language on unfairness by using Chinese instructions. The\nright two subfigures of Figure 3 summarize the similarity results for\nthe attribute “continent”.

This\nindicates the persistence of unfairness across different languages.\nAnother notable observation is that the similarity in the movie data\nis significantly lower when using Chinese prompts compared to\nEnglish prompts. This is because using a Chinese prompt on the\nmovie data can result in recommendation outputs that randomly\nmix both Chinese and English, naturally decreasing the similarity\nbetween recommendation results.\n5 CONCLUSION\nWith the advancement of LLMs, people are gradually recognizing\ntheir potential in recommendation systems [ 5, 7, 21, 39]. In this\nstudy, we highlighted the importance of evaluating recommenda-\ntion fairness when using LLMs for the recommendation. To better\nevaluate the fairness for RecLLM, we proposed a new evaluation\nbenchmark, named FaiRLLM, as well as a novel fairness evaluation\nmethod, several specific fairness metrics, and benchmark datasets\nspanning various domains with eight sensitive attributes. By con-\nducting extensive experiments using this benchmark, we found\nthat ChatGPT generates unfair recommendations, indicating the\npotential risks of directly applying the RecLLM paradigm. In the\nfuture, we will evaluate other LLMs such as text-davinci-003 and\nLLaMA [18], and design methods to mitigate the recommendation\nunfairness of RecLLM. Furthermore, the generative recommenda-\ntion has the potential to become the next recommendation par-\nadigm [36]. Our approach can also be regarded as a preliminary\nattempt to evaluate fairness in the generative recommendation of\ntext. In the future, we will also explore ways to measure fairness in\nother generative recommendation approaches.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation\nof China (62272437), and the CCCD Key Lab of Ministry of Culture\nand Tourism.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Himan Abdollahpouri, Robin Burke, and Bamshad Mobasher. 2017.
