INTRODUCTION\nThe distribution transformers or line transformers provide\nthe ﬁnal voltage transformation in the electric power distri-\nbution system, stepping down the voltage used in the dis-\ntribution lines to the level used by the customers [1], [2].\nDistribution transformers normally have ratings of less than\n200 kV A [3], [4]. Since distribution transformers are ener-\ngized for 24 hours a day (even when they don’t carry any\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Yu Liu\n.\nload), failures of distribution transformer have a serious\nimpact on the reliability and operational stability of the\nelectric power system [5], [6]. Many factors may have an\nimpact on the life of distribution transformer, e.g. surround-\ning weather conditions [7], high penetration of distributed\ngeneration [8], especially PV [9], high penetration of electric\nvehicles [10]. Also, gradual insulation aging (of paper and\nwinding insulation) caused by thermal effects in transform-\ners is one of the signiﬁcant factors which harm operation\nstability [11]–[13]. To ensure that distribution transformers\nprovide long and worry-free service, several diagnostic tests\n37456 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

For the oil-ﬁlled transformers, more pre-\ndominantly which are in service for more than or around\n20 to 25 years, it is suitable to estimate the remaining life\nof the transformers [14], [15]. It can be done by assessing\nthe details of degradation of the paper and winding insulation\nand development of furan and moisture content in transformer\noil [16]–[18]. Due to this, the dielectric strength of insulation\noil is affected [19].\nMain parameters like furan content, pollution index and\ndielectric strength of transformer oil are the parameters asso-\nciated with the oils quality as the overall performance of the\ntransformer is dependent on its cooling and dielectric strength\nof oils.\nBut in this article, there are considered 3 electrical factors\nthat may have an impact on the life of the distribution trans-\nformer. Thus, by generating the graph between intervals (in\nterms of time, yearly up to 30 years) [20] versus parameters\nlike:\n• furan content (FC),\n• pollution index (PI),\n• dielectric strength (DS) of transformer oil, it is possible\nto describe the life duration and the exact oil changing\nfrequency.\nThe measurements of the indicated parameters content are\ngenerally conducted ofﬂine and include electrical tests on the\ndevice terminals and physicochemical tests of insulating oil\nsamples taken from the transformer tank. However, recent\ntrends are towered to analyze the spectral response of trans-\nformer oil [21]–[23]. The example may be indicated for furan\ncontent: the quantitative spectral analysis of dissolved gas in\ntransformer oil based on the method of optimal directions\nis proposed in the paper [24]. The described model can be\nused for quantitative spectral analysis of dissolved gas in\ntransformer oil and can predict the component concentrations\nof the dissolved gas in transformer oil correctly and has high\neffectiveness [24]. In w paper [25], the authors proposed the\nuse of a laboratory measurement technique using gas chro-\nmatography with mass spectrometry (GC / MS) to determine\nthe number of gases dissolved in oil. In the case of infrared\nspectroscopy (IR), the tested oil sample is placed on the\npath of an infrared beam of a different wavelength, which\nabsorbs light when the energy of a typical molecular vibration\ncorresponds to the incident radiation [25]. After this beam has\npassed through the sample, the beam from the same source is\ninterfered with but has not passed through the sample, and\nthe spectrum is \"extracted\" using the Fourier transform of\nthe recorded interference spectrum. This method is named as\nFourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.\nIn this paper, there is a position on how to calcu-\nlate the life cycle of the distribution transformer and the\nexact oil changing frequency. To realize this task the\nnew equations are proposed. Equations were deﬁned in\naccordance with IEEE standards: IEEE Guide for Load-\ning Mineral-Oil-Immersed Transformers and Step-V oltage\nRegulators (IEEE Std. C57.91-2011) and IEEE Guide for\nthe Reclamation of Insulating Oil and Criteria for Its Use\n(IEEE Std C57.637-2015). Then, using proposed equation\n3 models in Matlab/Simulink are deﬁned for furan content\nformation, pollution index, and dielectric strength of the\noil. Additionally, the case study for a 100 kV A distribution\ntransformer is presented. Thus, the organization of the article\nis as follows: section 2 concerns life accession of distribu-\ntion transformer; section 3 describes methods of parameters\ncalculation; section 4 is results and discussion; section 5\nconcludes.\nII. SECTION LIFE ACCESSION OF DISTRIBUTION\nTRANSFORMER\nDistribution transformers are designed for paramount efﬁ-\nciency at a 60-70% load and do not normally operate at full\nload every time [26]. The load of the distribution transformer\nrests on distribution demand. However, in most cases dis-\ntribution transformer runs on 90% loading [27], [28]. Due\nto this loading in the transformer minor faults are always\navailable. Those minor faults after a long time change into\nthe major fault and this results in the failure of the dis-\ntribution transformer [29], [30]. Mainly such minor faults\nproduce because of the overloading of transformers [31].\nOverloading can be categorized into two types: over voltage\nand over current loading, consequences as increasing in the\ntemperature of the transformer winding and paper insula-\ntion mentioned in [20], they degrade then mix with oil and\nweaken oil’s dielectric property. This over thermal effect\nin winding and oil degrades their insulating quantity [32].\nAs the life of the distribution transformer increases their\noil quality also decreases [33]. Mainly by changing of oil\nof the transformer after a particular time this will increases\nthe average life and reduce the maintenance cost of the\ntransformer.\nBy maintaining quality or by changing the oil after a\nspeciﬁed time the life of the distribution transformer can be\nincreased. So, to provide oil changing frequency of distribu-\ntion transformer, it needs to consider the pollution index in\noil. The pollution index in transformer oil can be deﬁned as\nand the oil changing frequency depends on:\n• furan content formation.\n• pollution index.\n• dielectric strength of the oil.\nAll three factor depends on time. As the life of the trans-\nformer increases, the furan content formation and pollution\nindex is increases, because of this the dielectric strength of oil\nis reduced. By developing the mathematical Simulink model\nit is possible to plot curves with respect to time versus furan\ncontent formation, pollution index, and dielectric strength of\nthe oil. Also elaborate the rate of degradation in oil, oil chang-\ning frequency, and also the total life span of the transformer\n(for a speciﬁc rating of the transformer) and give desirable\nsolution to the utility for repair or replace the distribution\ntransformer and also provide data of periodically oil change\nrequirement.\nVOLUME 9, 2021 37457\nR. Soniet al.: Estimation of Life Cycle of Distribution Transformer\nA. FURAN CONTENT FORMATION\nFuran is a heterocyclic organic compound, consisting of a\nﬁve-membered aromatic ring with four carbon atoms and\none oxygen. Chemical compounds containing such rings are\nalso referred to as furans. Furan analysis of transformer oil\nindicates the degree of degradation of the transformer paper\ninsulation. This is usually done in transformers aging above\n15 years [34]. Furan indicates the compounds of carbon and\nhydrogen. When the furan count is above 2500 ppb [41],\nit means the transformer is about to fail or oil must have to\nchange or replace. Furan analysis is important in deciding\nwhen to discard a transformer unit or retain it.\nThis proposed formula of Furan content formation does not\nrequire any physical check or spectral oil analysis.\nThe calculation for furan content formation, F(t) Furan\ncontent formation is taken as a function of time because it’s\nincreasing with time due to temperature.\nLet consider F(t) is furan formation and it possible to obtain\nas\nF (t)=\n(\ne\n√\nt∗ξ\n)\n−1, (1)\nwhere ξis the heating factor depends on hotspot temperature\n(2bubble) and full load current. 2bubble is possible to ﬁt the hot\nspot temperature as a function of moisture and gas content\nand the total external pressure (atmospheric plus oil head).\nThe equation is as,\n2bubble =\n[ 6996.7\n22.454 +1.4495 ln Wwp −lnln P pres\n]\n−\n[(\ne(0.473Wwp)\n)(Vg(1.585)\n30\n)]\n−273a, (2)\nwhere 2bubble is the temperature of bubble evolution ◦C,\nPpres is total pressure, mm mercury (torr.) V g is the gas\ncontent of oil % (v/v), W wp is the percentage by weight of\nmoisture in the paper (dry basis) formula from IEEE guide for\nloading mineral-oil-immersed transformers and step-voltage\nregulators (IEEE Std. C57.91-2011) [35].\nB. POLLUTION INDEX\nThe pollution index can be deﬁned as the life of the trans-\nformer’s oil increases the pollution in oil in terms of furan\ncontent formation and another factor like insulation aging\nacceleration factor, due to this they degrade the dielectric\nquality of the oil. The quality of your transformer oil will\naffect its insulation and cooling properties. Under normal\noperating conditions, a minimal breakdown of oil quality will\noccur from oxidization and contamination [36]. These are\nsummarized as follows:\n• Contamination commonly found in transformer oil\nincludes water and particulate. The presence of either\nof these contaminants will reduce the insulating qual-\nities of your transformer oil. Oxidization is acid that\nforms in the oil when it comes in contact with oxygen.\nThe acid will form sludge which settles on the windings\nof the transformer resulting in reduced heat dissipation.\nThe windings will run hotter thereby creating more\nsludge which in turn will create even more heat. The high\nacid content and increased temperatures will accelerate\nthe deterioration of the insulating qualities of the oil and\nif left untreated will reason the transformer to fail.\nPollution Index Formulation can be obtained as,\nP.I.=F (t) +$FAA(t), (3)\nwhere F (t) is furan content formation, $ is relative factor\nwhich deﬁne the percentage for FAA ($ =0.42), FAA is\nInsulation Aging Acceleration Factor (function of time) [37].\nHere, FAA is based on transformer standards and calculates\nan insulation aging acceleration factor (FAA) which indicates\nhow fast the transformer insulation is aging [35]. The FAA for\neach time interval (1t) can be obtained as:\nFAA =e\n[ B\n(θHR+273) − B\n(θH+273) ]\n, (4)\nwhere FAA is the insulation aging acceleration factor, B is\ndesigned constant (typically 15000 oC), 2HR is winding\nhottest-spot temperature at rated load 90 ◦C if 1θW\nA ,R is\n55◦C and 110 ◦C if 1θW\nA ,R is 65 ◦C, 1θW\nA ,Ris aver-\nage winding rise over ambient at rated load (setting).\nThe formula from the IEEE guide for loading mineral-\noil-immersed transformers and step-voltage regulators.\n(IEEE Std. C57.91-2011) [35].\nC. DIELECTRIC STRENGTH OF OIL\nDielectric strength is an indicator used to assess the insulation\nproperties of transformer oil. It is very often equated with\nbreakdown voltage, but their numerical values are not equal.\nThe breakdown voltage is a minimum voltage applied to\ninsulation, resulting in its breaking down and becoming elec-\ntrically conductive [38]. At the same time, dielectric strength\nis a maximum electric ﬁeld that the insulation can withstand\nin ideal conditions without breaking down. The dielectric\nstrength of transformer oil is also known as the breakdown\nvoltage of the transformer oil. The ‘‘Breakdown V oltage’’\n(BDV) is measured by observing the voltage that is required\nto jump a spark between two electrodes immersed in the oil\nseparated by a speciﬁc gap or distance [36]. Also known\nas the sparking strength, the higher the voltage required to\njump the spark, the higher the BDV will be in the oil. The\nlower the voltage required to jump the spark, the BDV will\nbe lower indicating the presence of moisture content and\nother conducting substances in the oil. The value of dielectric\nstrength of fresh oil is 38.63 kV/mm, so as the life of the oil is\nincreasing it needs to replace oil around its value reduces to\n60% of 38.63kV/mm which is around 23.17 8kV/mm (after\n23 to 24 years). As per the IEEE Guide for the Reclamation\nof Insulating Oil and Criteria for Its Use [39] criteria for\nreclamation of insulating oil is when dielectric strength less\nthan 17kV , so here we assume at least 60% (average range\npercentage of total value) because after this it’s not safe to\nrun transformer. It is known that the dielectric strength of\nTransformer oil degrades with time when the increasing life\n37458 VOLUME 9, 2021\nR.

CALCULATIONS OF FC, PI, AND DS FOR 100 kVA\nDISTRIBUTION TRANSFORMER\nConsider a 100 kV A distribution transformer and detail tech-\nnical speciﬁcations are given in Table 1. It needs to calculate\noil changing frequency and life scale (in terms of furan\ncontent formation, PI, and dielectric strength) of 100 kV A\ndistribution transformer.\nA. CALCULATION FOR FURAN CONTENT FORMATION F (T)\nF (t) furan content is taken as a function of time because\nit’s increasing with time due to temperature [40]. In case\nthe total furan content formation is more than 2500 ppb,\nthe transformer oil needs to be replaced. The calculated value\nof 2bubble is 167 ◦C. With a gas content of 8%, the bubble\nevolution temperature would drop by only a degree.\nAssume 1.2% water in the paper insulation. To compute\nthe bubble evolution temperature from a winding at a depth\nof 2.4384 m from the top oil level of a large power trans-\nformer, the oil head must be added to the pressure in the gas\nspace above the oil. Assume 1% gas content in the oil.

So with the life of the transformer’s oil is\nincreases the pollution in oil in terms of Furan content For-\nmation and another factor like Insulation Aging Acceleration\nfactor [37], due to this they degrade the Dielectric quality of\nthe oil.

Soniet al.: Estimation of Life Cycle of Distribution Transformer\npolluted and by changing the oil of transformer at this age\nthis can be increased remanent life and also this process is\nmore economical than changing the solid insulation. Table 3\nshows Furan content formation versus time and Table 4 shows\nPollution index versus time. In this paper, the MATLAB script\nis used for the validation of results. After validation of results\nMATLAB Simulink tool used for creating Simulink models\n(Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3).\nFig. 4 shows the furan content formation increases with\ntime and in case the total furan content formation is more\nthan 2500 ppb, the transformer oil needs to be replaced,\nwhich is occurs in years around 27 to 28 years. So, around\nthis period oil must need to change. Fig. 5 the graph (PI vs.\ntime) shows that as the increasing life of the transformer the\nvalue of PI also increases. Fig. 6 shows that the dielectric\nstrength of transformer oil is decreasing with time as furan\ncontent formation and pollution index increases. Therefore,\nfor 100 kV A distribution transformer oil must need to change\nat the age of 22 to 23 years. The comparison plot of furan\ncontent, pollution index, and dielectric strength versus time\nare shown in Figs. 7 - 10 show MATLAB Simulink scope\nresult of furan content formation versus time, pollution index\nversus time, and dielectric strength versus time respectively.\nV. CONCLUSION\nTo ensure that distribution transformers provide long and\ntrouble-free service, it can be done by assessing the extent of\ndegradation of the paper insulation through furan content for-\nmation in transformer oil and dielectric strength of insulation\noil. This can help the utilities in making optimum use of the\nTransformers and also taking timely decisions regarding the\nrefurbishment/replacement of transformers. With the help of\nthe Simulink model, the solution to the utility for distribution\ntransformer (of any rating) is that calculate the accurate oil\nchanging frequency and life cycle of the transformer. The\nmainly required data for inserting in this model for generating\nthe life cycle of a distribution transformer is the full load\ncurrent of the transformer (secondary current), ﬂash point,\nand dielectric constant of oil. From the above solution, the life\nof transformers can also be increased.\nIt’s important to notice that the measurement of furan\ncontent, pollution index, and dielectric strength we have per-\nformed with the help of IEEE standards IEEE Std. C57.91-\n2011 and IEEE Std C57.637-2015.\nThe dielectric strength of transformer oil is decreasing with\ntime as furan content formation and pollution index increases.\nSo, for 100 kV A distribution transformer oil must need to\nchange at the age of 22 to 23 years, at this age its cross the\nlimit of 2500ppb, so it is suggested to change the oil at this age\nand by this we can increase the remnant life of transformer.\nThe indicated standards are deﬁned for natural mineral\noil and kraft paper, so we have proposed the mathematical\nmodel by assuming the mineral insulation oil and kraft paper\ninstead of thermally upgraded paper and bio-dielectric paper.\nSo, the mathematical model is not compatible with thermally\nupgraded papers and for biodegradable dielectric oil.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
