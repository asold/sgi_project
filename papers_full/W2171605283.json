An\nIshikawa diagram, also known as a cause-and-effect diagram or fishbone diagram, is often used in quality\nmanagement in manufacturing industries.\nIn this report, an Ishikawa diagram is used to demonstrate how to relate potential causes of a major presenting\nproblem in a clinical setting. This tool can be used by teams in problem-based learning or in self-directed learning\nsettings.\nAn Ishikawa diagram annotated with references to relevant medical cases and literature can be continually\nupdated and can assist memory and retrieval of relevant medical cases and literature. It could also be used to\ncultivate a lifelong learning habit in medical professionals.\nIntroduction\nDoctors are accustomed to learning from their more\nexperienced peers as well as from their own experiences\nin treating their patients [1]. Because of this, it is impor-\ntant that they develop learning techniques that are\nproactive and encourage a lifelong learning orientation.\nCase reports can provide valuable sources of informa-\ntion for others to learn from. Studying medical cases is\nan effective way to enhance clinical reasoning skills and\nreinforce clinical knowledge [2]. A case report provides\nimportant and detailed information about a patient that\nis often lost in larger studies [3]. Reading case reports is\nalso intellectually stimulating. When clinicians or medi-\ncal students analyze a clinical problem, they usually start\nwith potential common causes. For example, if a patient\npresents with secondary amenorrhea, a clinician will\nconsider common causes such as pregnancy and use of\ncontraceptive medications before exploring other less\ncommon but critical causes such as hyperprolactinemia,\novarian cancer and so on.\nWhen clinicians are faced with a puzzling clinical pro-\nblem, they may search journals that publish clinical\ncases for information about the condition [4]. There are\nvarious sources for medical cases such as theJournal of\nMedical Case Reports , BMJ Case Reports and the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine. However, because of the\ndiversity of the case reports, it may be difficult to recall\nand organize the located material in a systematic man-\nner in order to explain a clinical problem. Ishikawa dia-\ngrams are an efficient way of organizing case reports in\na clinical setting.\nMethods\nThe Ishikawa diagram was invented by Kaoru Ishikawa,\nwho pioneered quality management techniques in Japan\nin the 1960 s. The diagram is considered one of the\nseven basic tools of quality control [5]. It is also known\nas a fishbone diagram because of its shape. The ‘fish\nhead’ represents the main problem. The potential causes\nof the problem, usually derived from brainstorming ses-\nsions or research, are indicated in the‘fish bones’ of the\ndiagram.\nAs an example for illustration,‘secondary amenorrhea/\noligomenorrhea’ h a sb e e nc h o s e na st h em a i np r e s e n t i n g\nproblem. ‘Secondary amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea ’\nis indicated in the head of the Ishikawa diagram (Figure 1).\nWhen searching for the potential causes of the main pre-\nsenting problem, one can either work in a team with others\nCorrespondence: kam.wong@sydney.edu.au\n1University of Sydney, Sydney Medical School, NSW, Australia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nWong Journal of Medical Case Reports2011, 5:120\nhttp://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/5/1/120 JOURNAL OF MEDICAL\nCASE REPORTS\n© 2011 Wong; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Clinicians would\nconduct brainstorming sessions and search the relevant\njournals to find potential causes for secondary amenor-\nrhea/oligomenorrhea, lis ting them on a whiteboard or\nflipchart. The list would then be reviewed to extract rele-\nvant causes in the context of the main presenting pro-\nblem. These causes would then be organized in the‘fish\nbones’ of an Ishikawa diagram (Figure 1). There is no\nlimit to the number of‘fish bones’ in the diagram. Each\n‘fish bone’ can be subdivided into smaller‘bones’ if neces-\nsary to show the relationship of all potential causes to the\npresenting problem. For example, ‘chemotherapy and\nradiotherapy’ are indicated in the branch of the‘fishbone’\nthat shows the cause of ovarian failure, a potential cause\nfor secondary amenorrhea/oligomenorrhea (Figure 1).\nThe cited references for the relevant case reports and lit-\neratures are also indicated in the Ishikawa diagram so\nthat readers can retrieve the case reports and relevant lit-\neratures easily.\nThe potential causes for secondary amenorrhea/oligo-\nmenorrhea have been identified and categorized in four\ngroups related to ‘women’s reproductive systems’, ‘other\nsystems in the body’, ‘psychosocial ’,a n d‘miscellaneous,\nfor example drugs’. The causes include pregnancy [6],\npolycystic ovarian syndrome [6], amenorrhea after oral\ncontraceptive/depot medroxyprogesterone treatment [7],\neating disorder (for example ,a n o r e x i an e r v o s a )[ 7 ] ,\npremature ovarian failure [8], excessive physical exercise\n[9,10], excessive stress [11], prolonged use of\nanti-psychotic [7,12], hypothyroidism [13], hyperprolac-\ntinemia [14], ovarian cancer [15], and Cushing syn-\ndrome [16]. Thus the Ishikawa diagram illustrates and\nsummarizes the potential causes for secondary amenor-\nrhea/oligomenorrhea (Figure 1).\nConclusions\nRare but critical cases should be studied and included in\nan Ishikawa diagram to remind clinicians of relevant\ninformation during their clin ical reasoning processes.\nFor example, the Journal of Medical Case Reports has\npublished the case of a 22-year-old lactating woman\nwho presented with four months of amenorrhea asso-\nciated with signs of virilization. The patient was diag-\nnosed as having an androgen secreting steroid cell\nSecondary \nAmenorrhea/ \nOligomenorrhea\nWoman \nreproductive \nsystem\nPsycho-social\nOther systems in \nthe body\nMiscellaneous\nPost oral contraceptive/ depot \nmedroxyprogesterone [7]\nPolycystic ovary \nsyndrome [6]\nPregnant [6]\nCushing syndrome [16]\nHypothyroidism [13]\nProlonged use of  \ndrugs e.g. \nantipsychotic [7, 12]\nEating disorder (e.g. \nAnorexia nervosa) [7]Excessive stress [11]\nOvarian failure\nHyperprolactinaemia [14]\nExcessive  physical \nexercise [9, 10]\nChemo & radiotherapy [8]\nOvarian tumor [15]\nFigure 1 Ishikawa diagram. ‘Woman’s reproductive system’ includes causes such as pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian tumor, and\novarian failure. ‘Other systems in the body’ includes causes such as hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, and eating\ndisorders. ‘Psychosocial’ includes causes such as excessive stress and excessive physical exercise.‘Miscellaneous’ includes causes such as\nprolonged use of drugs, for example anti-psychotics, and after oral contraceptive/depot medroxyprogesterone treatment.\nWong Journal of Medical Case Reports2011, 5:120\nhttp://www.jmedicalcasereports.com/content/5/1/120\nPage 2 of 3\ntumor of the ovary [15]. In addition,BMJ Case Reports\nhas published a case demonstrating the relationship\nbetween hypothyroidism and secondary amenorrhea.\nImportant learning points are highlighted: serum thyroid\nstimulating hormone (TSH) should be measured in\nevery adolescent with menstrual irregularities, multicys-\ntic ovaries as a presenting manifestation of juvenile\nhypothyroidism is a rare occurrence and represents\nadvanced disease, and appropriate diagnosis and\nlevothyroxine replacement therapy is effective and it can\nprevent inadvertent surgery [13].\nFurthermore, the reader should appraise the published\ncase to assess the credibility of the information and\nshould look for updated infor m a t i o ni nt h ef u t u r e .F o r\nexample, if the readers are not fully convinced of the\nexplanation for the pathophysiology of ‘specificity spill\nover’ phenomenon that may contribute to multicystic\novaries [13,17], he or she should search for more infor-\nmation about it and look out for future publications on\nthis topic. Information gathered from other sources can\nbe included in the diagram as well, such as the paper\npublished in theBritish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynae-\ncology, which has substantiated information about ovar-\nian cancers and amenorrhea [8]. In this way, continually\norganizing and updating information on an Ishikawa\ndiagram can cultivate lifelong learning habits in medical\nprofessionals.\nMedical educators can also apply Ishikawa diagrams to\nfacilitate problem-based learning when teaching medical\nstudents and junior doctors. Starting with a clinical\nvignette, facilitators can help medical students and\njunior doctors to identify the main presenting problem\nof a patient, conduct brainstorming sessions and search\nin the literature to find the potential causes, then cate-\ngorize these causes in an Ishikawa diagram. The Ishi-\nkawa diagram can then be kept by individual learners\nfor continual updating when they acquire new or rele-\nvant information. In shor t, an Ishikawa diagram can\nassist memory and the retrieval of relevant medical case\nreports and literatures.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank theJournal of Medical Case Reportsand BMJ Case\nReports for providing access to the case reports, and the peer reviewers and\nDr Myra Dunn (Education Officer at Beyond Medical Education, Australia) for\ntheir comments and suggestions.
