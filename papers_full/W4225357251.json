Due to the high blocking voltage, fast switching\nspeed, low switching loss, and high-temperature endurability,\nnewly emerged MV SiC MOSFETs have a great potential to\nimprove the efﬁciency and power density of MV converters and\ndrive down the system complexity [4], [5]. On the other hand,\nthe isolated gate driver (GD) is required to provide the sufﬁcient\ngalvanic isolation and high common-mode transient immunity\n(CMTI) for MV SiC MOSFET applications [6].\nManuscript received August 23, 2021; revised January 26, 2022; accepted\nMarch 1, 2022.

The signal- and power-isolation methods of GDs for\nSiC devices with different voltage rating are summarized in\nFig. 1(b). The signal isolation of GDs can be implemented\nby the GD integrated circuit (GDIC) [7], digital isolator [8],\ntransformer [9], and ﬁber-optic (FO) [10]–[15]. For MV SiC\nMOSFETs, FOs are usually adopted to transmit the signal with a\nsufﬁcient galvanic isolation and little coupling capacitance Ccp\non the signal path but with a size and cost penalty [10]–[15].\nLike the other signal-isolation method based GDs, secondary\ncircuits of the FO-based GD are tied to the source terminal of SiC\nMOSFET, the signal-processing circuit is therefore susceptible\nto the common-mode (CM) current noise induced by the high\ndv/dt and may be malfunctioning [10]. The effect of CM current\nnoise can be mitigated by unbalanced impedance paths, but one\nadditional GDPS and one additional GDIC or digital isolator are\nrequired [11], [12].\nThe power-isolation methods of GDPSs can be categorized\ninto four types: magnetic-core transformer coupling (MCTC)\n[13]–[18]; wireless power transfer (WPT) [19], [20]; optical\npower transfer (OPT) [21], [22]; and coreless transformer cou-\npling (CLTC) [23]–[25]. MCTC GDPSs have been widely\napplied for low-voltage (LV) SiC MOSFETs. To reduce the\nCcp of MCTC GDPS for 10 kV SiC MOSFETs, printed circuit\nboard (PCB) windings are developed to reduce the overlap of\nmagnetic-core and windings and, thus, enable a Ccp <3p F ,b u t\nthe clearance and creepage distances among the magnetic-core\nand windings result in a bulky GDPS size [13], [14]. A small\nmagnetic-core transformer (16 mm × 16 mm × 14 mm) using\nseparated E-cores is built for a MCTC GDPS with a Ccp of\n4.1 pF; however, these E-cores require a complex and costly\nmanufacturing process, such as the graphite spray and cores\nmounting/alignment [15]. Another MCTC GDPS acts like a\ncurrent-source to supply multiple secondary loads with a single-\nturn primary winding, where the long cable connection as well as\nthe air gap between magnetic-cores and primary-winding make\nthe GDPS bulky, and extra efforts are needed for the mechanical\ninstallation and the fault diagnostic of GD system [16]–[18].\nWPT GDPSs for MV SiC MOSFETs utilizes the air gap between\ntransmitter and receiver coils as the isolation barrier [19], [20].\nDue to a low dielectric breakdown (2.5–3 kV/mm) of the air, the\nlarge air gap is required and, thus, WPT GDPSs usually have a\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

OPT GDPSs deliver the GD power by the laser\nlight via the optical ﬁber, which ensures an unlimited isolation\nand eliminates the Ccp [21], [22]. However, the transmitted\nGD power is < 1 W and the transmission efﬁciency is < 25%\n[21]. Moreover, the laser transmitter has a very bulky volume\n[22]. CLTC GDPSs utilizing the solid and liquid dielectrics are\nexplored recently [23]–[25]. They not only remove the insulation\nissue among the magnetic core and windings but also enable\na thinner barrier thickness than the air-based WPT GDPSs. A\nnonoverlapped PCB windings potted in Epoxy is designed for\nMV GDPS with a low Ccp of 3.89 pF, but the nonoverlapping\ncoils have a relatively large footprint (69 mm × 69 mm) and\ndecrease the GDPS efﬁciency ( <50%) [23]. The coreless PCB\ntransformer with FR4 dielectric has an estimated insulating\nvoltage > 40 kV and a Ccp < 10 pF [24]. The coreless PCB\ntransformers immersed in the liquid Midel-7131 are veriﬁed to\nwithstand the insulating voltage of 33–73 kV RMS [25].\nDue to the separate signal and power transmissions and the\nbulky size of GDPSs, state-of-the-art isolated GDs for MV\nSiC MOSFETs still exhibit large size and high cost. Moreover,\nintegrating the GD into the MV SiC MOSFET module package\nwill help to improve the reliability and enhance the switching\nperformance, which requires a compact GD design [16], [17].\nThe pulse-transformer GD has a good potential to achieve the\ncompact design since both signal isolation and power transfer\nare implemented via the pulse transformer [26]–[29]. However,\nmost pulse transformers operate at the pulsewidth modulation\n(PWM) frequency and suffer the voltage-second limitation. In\naddition, these pulse-transformer GDs only can operate in a\nnarrow duty-cycle range and cannot allow the fast change of\nduty cycle, which limits their applications. Moreover, these\npulse-transformer GDs cannot transfer the power at low or zero\nduty cycle; therefore, the GD secondary circuits, especially the\nprotection circuits, cannot be powered on all the time [26],\n[27]. High frequency (HF) modulated pulse-transformer GDs\nare developed to solve these problems [28], [29]. However, the\nmodulation frequency is only 1 MHz due to the high switching\nloss, which causes a large propagation delay and low duty-cycle\nresolution [29]. Moreover, magnetic cores are usually adopted\nby these pulse transformers to achieve high coupling factor,\nwhich, however, is challenging to meet the insulation require-\nments if they are applied for MV SiC MOSFET GDs.\nThis article proposes a signal-power integrated GD using\n20 MHz pulse transformer to transmit the PWM signal and\nGD power simultaneously for MV SiC MOSFETs, shown in\nFig. 1(c). The proposed circuit schematic and modulation prin-\nciple enables the GD to achieve a constant power transmission\nregardless of the varied PWM duty cycle. Compared to the\nexisting high-frequency modulated pulse-transformer GDs, the\nproposed GD has a lower total propagation delay time (i.e., <75\nns) and a higher PWM duty-cycle resolution (i.e., ≤0.2%). The\n20 MHz class-E resonant ﬂyback converter (RFC) is selected\nto excite the pulse transformer with the minimum component\ncount. Active clamping circuits are proposed to allow the GD\nto operate in the full PWM duty-cycle range (i.e., 0%–100%).\nAiming at MV SiC MOSFET applications, a PCB-based coreless\ntransformer is adopted to achieve an insulation voltage higher\nthan 10 kV RMS,al o w Ccp of 5.85 pF and a compact GD size.\nThe proposed GD does not need additional GDPSs and FOs,\nwhich achieves a smaller size and enables a higher power density\nfor MV SiC-based converters. The CMTI of proposed GD is\ncharacterized as >100 V/ns. The proposed GD is experimentally\nveriﬁed on 3.3 and 10 kV SiC MOSFETs.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II\nintroduces the operation principle and key subcomponents of\nproposed GD. The low propagation delay time analysis and\nfull PWM duty-cycle range implementation of proposed GD are\npresented in Section III. Section IV provides the experimental\nveriﬁcations. Finally, Section V concludes this article.\nII. O PERATION PRINCIPLE AND CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION\nA. Introduction of Proposed GD and Design Requirement\nThe block diagram of the proposed signal-power integrated\nGD is shown in Fig. 2(a). It consists of ﬁve subcomponents:\nan ON/OFF control unit; two identical isolated dc–dc converters\n(ID2DCs) in input-parallel-output-parallel (IPOP) architecture;\na PWM signal regenerator; a dc–dc voltage regulator; and a\nGD actuator. The ON/OFF control unit is triggered by the PWM\ninput signal to generate complementary ON/OFF control signals\nthat regulate ON/OFF status of two ID2DCs. ID2DC #1 is at ON\nstatus when PWM = “1” while ID2DC #2 is at ON status when\nPWM =“0.” Due to the IPOP architecture and complementary\noperation manner, there is always one ID2DC transmitting the\npower to supply the GD secondary circuits. Therefore, the output\nvoltage of ID2DCs Vo is maintained constant within the full\nGUO AND LI: MHz-PULSE-TRANSFORMER ISOLATED GD WITH SIGNAL-POWER INTEGRATED TRANSMISSION 9417\nFig. 2. Proposed signal-power integrated GD. (a) Block diagram.\n(b) Key waveforms.\nPWM duty-cycle range (i.e., 0%–100%). At GD secondary side,\nthe PWM signal regenerator detects the ON/OFF status of two\nID2DCs to synchronize the edge signals of the regenerated\nPWM signal. As shown in Fig. 2(b), OFF-to-ON transitions of two\nID2DCs are detected to trigger the rising edge and falling edge,\nrespectively, for the PWM signal regeneration. With the identical\nedge-triggering mechanism and same circuit parameters, the\npropagation delay times from low to high and from high to low\nare the same.\nThe voltage regulator is fed by Vo of ID2DCs and supplies\nthe positive and negative GD voltages Vdd and Vee for the GD\nactuator, as well as the Vcc for PWM signal regenerator and\nother secondary circuits, such as DESAT and UVLO protection\ncircuits. With the regenerated PWM signal, Vdd and Vee,t h eG D\nactuator outputs the drive voltage vdr with the desired timing and\nmagnitude. The GD actuator utilizes the MOSFET or BJT based\ntotem-pole bridge to ensure the fast rising/falling time of vdr and\nthe sufﬁcient peak gate current, which could fully leverage the\nfast switching capability of MV SiC MOSFETs.\nThe complimentary ON/OFF operation manner of the IPOP\nID2DCs not only transfers the GD power continuously, but\nalso transmits the PWM signal. The proposed signal-power\nintegrated GD needs to consider following design aspects.\n1) ID2DCs need to operate at the HF or the very HF (VHF)\nto achieve a low propagation delay time and a high PWM\nduty-cycle resolution. The PWM duty-cycle resolution,\nD.R., is determined by the ID2DC’s switching frequency\nfid2dc as\nD.R. = fpwm\nfid2dc\n×100%. (1)\nGiven fpwm =40 kHz, fid2dc must be ≥4 MHz to obtain the\nD.R. of ≤ 1%, and ≥ 20 MHz to obtain D.R. of ≤ 0.2%.\n2) Soft switching is required for ID2DCs to obtain the high\nefﬁciency at HF/VHF range, which can reduce the ther-\nmal stress and thus enable a embedment design into the\npackages.\nTABLE I\nCOMPONENT COUNTS COMPARISON OF THREE TOPOLOGY CANDIDATES\n3) ID2DCs should have a simple topology with the minimum\ncomponent counts for a higher reliability and a smaller\nsize.\n4) The galvanic isolation of the proposed GD is provided\nby the ID2DCs, which must meet the MV insulation\nrequirement and have a low Ccp to enhance the CMTI.\nIn addition, a compact size is desired for the insulation\nsolution.\n5) The PWM signal regenerator needs to operate normally\nwithin the full PWM duty-cycle range (i.e., 0%–100%)\nand have a minimized propagation delay time.\nThe detailed description of key sub-components with their\nfeatures is presented as follows.\nB. ID2DC Topology With Minimum Component Counts\nSeveral isolated resonant converter topologies are available\nfor HF and VHF operation with the soft-switching realization.\nTo achieve the high reliability and high power density, the\ntopology with the minimum counts of components, especially\nactive switches and discrete inductors, is desired to implement\nthe ID2DCs of proposed GD. The general architecture of these\nisolated resonant converter topologies consists of an inverter, a\ntransformer, and a rectiﬁer. In these topologies, the ones with\nclass-E or class- Ф2 inverter have only one active switch, and\nthis active switch is at the low side and thus easy-to-drive; the\nones with class-E rectiﬁer have the minimum count of rectiﬁer\ndiodes. Therefore, the topologies with both class-E or class- Ф2\ninverter and class-E rectiﬁer become candidates, which include\nclass-E RFC [30], class- Ф2 RFC [31] and isolated class- Ф2\nconverter [32]. The component counts of these three topologies\nare compared in Table I, where the main difference is the count\nof discrete inductors and resonant capacitors. From Table I, the\nclass-E RFC has zero discrete inductor and the minimum count\nof resonant capacitors, so it is selected to implement the ID2DCs\nof proposed GD. To achieve a low propagation delay time and\nah i g hP W MD.R.,t h e fid2dc is set as 20 MHz.\nThe circuit schematic of ID2DCs and ON/OFF control unit is\nshown in Fig. 3. A 20-MHz VHF signal is generated by the\noscillator (OSC). The PWM signal is modulated with 20-MHz\nVHF signal to produce the gate signals of two class-E RFCs. As\nthe switching frequency of RFCs enters VHF range, a coreless\ntransformer is typically adopted. As shown in Fig. 3, all the\ninductances Ll1, LM, and Ll2 are absorbed by the coreless\ntransformer without the extra discrete inductors. The class-E\nRFC features the high efﬁciency by the zero-voltage switching\n(ZVS) for switches Q1∼2 and zero-current switching (ZCS) for\ndiodes Dr1∼2. The resonant driving method is applied to reduce\nthe driving loss of Q1∼2. To eliminate another high isolation\n9418 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 37, NO. 8, AUGUST 2022\nFig. 3.

(b) Key waveforms.\nvoltage requirement and extra Ccp by the isolated feedback loop,\nclass-E RFCs are operated in the open loop.\nC. PWM Signal Regenerator With Minimized Propagation\nDelay Time\nThe circuit schematic of PWM signal regenerator is shown\nin Fig. 4(a), where the edge-based signal-processing circuits,\nincluding the envelope detector and RC differential circuit, are\nadopted to minimize the propagation delay time.\nTo detect the ON/OFF status of two class-E RFCs shown in\nFig. 3, two envelope detectors, formed by D1, C1, R1 and D2,\nC2, R2, are connected to the anodes of Dr1 and Dr2, respectively.\nFig. 5. PCB-based coreless transformer integration into the proposed GD.\nThe output voltage of the envelope detector, also the envelope\nvoltage (i.e., the voltage on C1∼2), has a step rising edge since\nC1∼2 is charged abruptly to Vo via D1∼2 at RFCs’ OFF-to-ON\ntransitions. So, the rising edge of the envelope voltage can track\nRFCs’OFF-to-ON transitions with a negligible propagation delay.\nTwo RC differential circuits, formed by C3, R3, D3 and C4, R4,\nD4, respectively, are used to extract the rising edges of envelope\nvoltage with no propagation delay. The extracted edge signals are\nthen buffered as the PWM rising- and falling-edge signals, both\nof which are sent into a RS ﬂip-ﬂop to regenerate PWM signal.\nThe key waveforms of PWM signal regenerator are shown in\nFig. 4(b). The propagation delay time of PWM signal regenerator\nis only contributed by the Buffer 3∼4 and RS ﬂip-ﬂop, which is\nless than the comparator-based signal-processing circuits.\nD. Transformer Integration With Compact Size\nThe PCB-based coreless transformer is adopted to achieve\na compact size, where PCB itself (a solid dielectric) is uti-\nlized as the isolation barrier. The transformer integration into\nthe proposed GD is shown in Fig. 5. The proposed GD is\ndesigned within a vertically stacked structure, consisting of\nthe primary PCB, transformer PCB, and secondary PCB. The\ncoreless transformer is printed on the transformer PCB with\na spiral winding structure so that the primary and secondary\nwindings are separated at the top and bottom layers of the\ntransformer PCB, respectively. Compared to the helical winding\nstructure, the spiral winding structure avoids the vias and enables\nthe use of two-layer PCB, which simpliﬁes the insulation design\nand reduces PCB cost. Although only one transformer is visible\nin Fig. 5 given in the side view, there are two transformers in the\nproposed GD. With the proposed integration method, only the\ntransformer PCB provides the isolation barrier and contributes\nthe Ccp.T h e Ccp is mainly determined by the geometry of\ntransformer windings and PCB dielectric constant, that is\nC ∝ ε0εrS\nd (2)\nwhere ε0εr is the dielectric constant of transformer PCB, d is\nthe thickness of transformer PCB, and S is the area of windings.\nTo ensure a sufﬁcient insulation voltage and a low coupling\ncapacitance, dielectrics with the high breakdown strength and\nlow dielectric constant are preferred. Arlon-DiClad-880, a type\nof polytetraﬂuorethylene material, with the dielectric strength >\n45 kV/mm and εr of ∼2.2 is selected. d =1.6 mm is set consid-\nering a tradeoff between the coupling factor and the coupling ca-\npacitance. The Ccp of coreless transformer is extracted by Ansys\nGUO AND LI: MHz-PULSE-TRANSFORMER ISOLATED GD WITH SIGNAL-POWER INTEGRATED TRANSMISSION 9419\nFig. 6. Simulated E-ﬁeld distribution of the proposed GD.\nQ3D extractor, which is only 2.3 pF for a single transformer and\n5 pF for a pair of transformers. To avoid the surface ﬂashover\nalong the transformer PCB and eliminate the large creepage\ndistance, the silicone gel (SilGel 612) encapsulation is applied to\nthe transformer PCB and primary PCB as shown in Fig. 5. Please\nnote that to enhance the insulation, the secondary PCB can also\nbe encapsulated after GD secondary circuit parameters, such as\ngate resistances, GD supply voltages ( Vdd/Vee) and protection\ncircuits are tuned to optimize the device switching performance\nand protection.\nFig. 6 shows the simulated electric-ﬁeld distribution of the\nproposed GD. The electric-ﬁeld stress mainly occurs in the\ndielectric of transformer PCB and the surrounding silicone gel.\nWith a potential difference of 5 kV between the primary and\nsecondary sides of GD, the maximum electric-ﬁeld is observed\nto be 8.6 kV/mm, which is lower than the dielectric strength of\ntransformer PCB (45 kV/mm) and silicone gel (23 kV/mm).\nIII. L OW PROPAGATIONDELAY TIME ANALYSIS AND FULL\nPWM DUTY-CYCLE RANGE IMPLEMENTATION\nA. Propagation Delay Time Analysis\nAs illustrated in Fig. 7, the total propagation delay time\nTpd,total is the sum of four subintervals ( ti ∼ ti+1, i = 1 ∼\n4), that is\nTpd,total =\n4∑\ni=1\n(ti+1 −ti)= Tpd,gate\n+Tpd,RFC +Tpd,buf +Tpd,RS (3)\nwhere Tpd,gate = t2 – t1 is the propagation delay time of GD\nprimary-side logic gates. Tpd,RFC = t3 – t2 is the delay time\nFig. 7. Total propagation delay time. (a) Minimum propagation delay time.\n(b) Maximum propagation delay time.\ncaused by class-E RFCs. Tpd,buf = t4 – t3 and Tpd,RS = t5 – t4\nare the propagation delay times of GD secondary-side Buffer3∼4\nand RS ﬂip-ﬂop, respectively.Tpd,gate, Tpd,buf, and Tpd,RS are all\ndetermined by the selected ICs and, thus, remain constant, while\nTpd,RFC varies in a speciﬁc range due to the asynchronization\nof OSC’s output signal and PWM signal.\nThe minimum Tpd,RFC occurs when the OSC’s output signal\nand PWM signal are synchronized, which is shown in Fig. 7(a).\nIn this case, the ﬁrst pulse of Q1’s gate signal after t1 has a\ncomplete pulse width (i.e., one half of OCS’s cycle, 1/2 Tosc),\nand the envelope voltage (i.e., the voltage on C1) reaches Vo\nwithin 1/4 Tosc. So, the minimum Tpd,RFC approximately equals\nto\nTpd,RFC,min = Vth\n4Vo\nTosc (4)\nwhere Vth is Buffer3∼4’s threshold voltage for high-level input.\nThe maximum Tpd,RFC occurs when the OSC’s output signal\nis leading PWM signal by around 1/4 Tosc, which is shown in\nFig. 7(b). In this case, the ﬁrst pulse of Q1’s gate signal after t1\nhas a pulse-width shorter than 1/4 Tosc, and the envelope voltage\n(i.e., the voltage on C1) cannot reach Vo until the next OSC cycle.\nTherefore, the maximum Tpd,RFC approximately equals to\nTpd,RFC,max = 1\n4Tosc + 1\n2Tosc +Vth\n4Vo\nTosc\n= 3\n4Tosc +Tpd,RFC,min. (5)\nTable II gives the breakdown of total propagation delay time\nwith the selected ICs.

False PWM signal regeneration with D close to 100%.\nsignal are synchronized, the total propagation delay time of\nproposed GD is only 36.5 ns. When OCS’s output signal and\nPWM signal are asynchronized, the total propagation delay time\nof proposed GD has a range of 36.5–74 ns. This low propagation\ndelay time is comparable with the state-of-the-art commercial\nisolated GDICs. When OSC’s output signal and PWM signal are\nasynchronized, the difference of Tpd,RFC,max and Tpd,RFC,min\nmay result in a propagation jitter. Like commercial GDICs, this\npropagation jitter should be considered for setting the dead-time\nfor a phase-leg circuit. This propagation jitter can either be\nshortened by increasing the operation frequency of ID2DCs, or\nbe eliminated by synchronizing OSC’s output signal and PWM\nsignal.\nB. Duty-Cycle Range Limitation and Extension\nAs shown in Fig. 4, C1∼2 is discharged via R1∼2 during RFCs’\nOFF status and the envelope voltage has a smooth falling edge,\nwhich results in a false PWM signal regeneration when the PWM\nduty cycle D is close to 0% or 100%. For example, the false PWM\nsignal regeneration with D close to 100% is illustrated in Fig. 8.\nWhen D is not close to 100% during tx0 ∼ tx2, the envelope\nvoltage decreases exponentially during tx1 ∼ tx2 and drops to\n0 before tx2. With a large time constant R1∼2C1∼2, the voltage\nripple of envelope voltage during class-E RFC’s ON status is\nignored, so the envelope voltage ve during the discharging\ninterval (tx1 ∼ tx2)i se x p r e s s e da s\nve = Voe− t\nR1C1 = Voe− t\nτo (6)\nwhere τo is the original time constant and τo = R1∼2C1∼2.\nSince ve drops to 0 within 5 τo < (tx2 – tx1) and remains 0\nbefore tx2, the output voltage of RC differential circuit (i.e., the\nvoltage on R3) steps from 0 to Vo (Vo > Vth)a t tx2, which will\nnormally trigger the PWM rising-edge signal. However, when\nD is close to 100% during tx2∼tx4, ve cannot drop to 0 during\ntx3 ∼ tx4 (Δt = tx4 – tx3 = (1–D)/fpwm), and the magnitude of\nve at tx4 is\nve (tx4)= Voe−(tx4−tx3)\nτo = Voe−Δt\nτo . (7)\nSince ve(tx4) >0, the output voltage of RC differential circuit\n(i.e., the voltage on R3) steps from 0 to Vm (Vm < Vo)a t tx4,\nand Vm equals to the difference of Vo and ve(tx4), that is\nVm = Vo −ve (tx4)= Vo\n(\n1−e−Δt\nτo\n)\n= Vo\n(\n1−e− (1−D)\nτofpwm\n)\n.\n(8)\nAccording to (8), a larger D results in a lower Vm. When Vm\n< Vth, the rising-edge signal in Fig. 4(a) cannot be triggered\nnormally and a false PWM signal will be generated. Substitute\nVm = Vth into (8), leading to the critical value of Δt\nΔtcrit = τo ln\n( Vo\nVo −Vth\n)\n. (9)\nD should meet (10) to normally trigger the PWM rising-edge\nsignal when D is close to 100%\nΔtcrit < 1−D\nfpwm\n. (10)\nSimilarly, D should meet (11) to normally trigger the PWM\nfalling-edge signal when D is close to 0%\nΔtcrit < D\nfpwm\n. (11)\nSubstitute (9) into (10) and (11), leading to a limited PWM\nduty-cycle range Dlimited as\nfpwmR1∼2C1∼2 ln\n( Vo\nVo −Vth\n)\n<D limited\n< 1−fpwmR1∼2C1∼2 ln\n( Vo\nVo −Vth\n)\n. (12)\nGiven R1∼2 = 1.2 k Ω, C1∼2 = 1.2 nF and fpwm = 40 kHz,\nΔtcrit = 1.26 μs, and Dlimited = [5%, 95%] are calculated\naccording to (9) and (12). To extend the PWM duty-cycle\nrange, the active clamping circuits, consisting of resistors R5∼6,\nswitches Saux1∼2 and one-shot triggers, are added into the pre-\nvious envelop detectors, which are shown in Fig. 9. The gate\nsignal of Saux1∼2 is provided by the one-shot trigger that is\nsynchronized with the opposite edge signal. The key waveforms\nof PWM signal regeneration with proposed active clamping\ncircuits are shown in Fig. 10. Since R5∼6 has a much smaller\nresistance than R1∼2, the envelope voltage can decrease faster\nthan that without the active clamping circuits, the improved\nenvelop detector therefore has a step falling edge.\nWith the proposed active clamping circuits, the extended\nPWM duty-cycle range Dextended is determined by the pulse\nwidth of gate signals for Saux1∼2, Δtw, that is\nfpwmΔtw <D extended < 1−fpwmΔtw.

Δtw = 50 ns\nis compatible with the expected PWM D.R. of 0.2%, so the\nproposed GD can operate in the full PWM duty-cycle range\n[0%, 100%] with the active clamping circuits.\nFig. 11.

Therefore, the proposed GD\ncan provide a low total propagation delay time and thus is\nsuitable for SiC MOSFETs with a high switching frequency.\nC. High-V oltage Insulation V eriﬁcation of GD Transformer\nThe high-voltage (HV) insulation of GD transformer is ver-\niﬁed using the HV test setup shown in Fig. 17(a). A 60-Hz ac\nvoltage is applied across the primary and secondary side of\ntransformer. The partial discharge (PD) test is ﬁrst conducted\nat ac voltage of 10.4 kV RMS (14.7 kVpk) for 60 min. The\nrecorded PD data are shown in Fig. 17(b), which is free of PD\nor breakdown failure. The PD inception voltage (PDIV) is also\ncharacterized by increasing the ac voltage until the PD reaches\nthe threshold 10 pC. As shown in Fig. 17(c), the measured PDIV\nis 16.4 kV RMS. The breakdown test is conducted by increasing\nthe ac voltage until electric breakdown occurs. As shown in\nFig. 17(d), the measured breakdown voltage is 34.4 kV RMS.\nThese test results demonstrate that the GD transformer can\nwithstand an insulation voltage higher than 10 kV RMS.\nD. CMTI Characterization and V eriﬁcation\nTo evaluate the robustness of proposed GD to high dv/dt,t h e\nCMTI of proposed GD is characterized experimentally based\non the method of [33]. The CMTI test setup is shown in Fig. 18\nwhere a SiC-based half-bridge circuit is built to generate CM\nvoltage pulses with a 2-kV magnitude, 50% duty cycle and a\ndv/dt > 100 V/ns. The vdr of proposed GD is measured by\nTektronix IsoVu Probe TIVH08L; the vcm across the primary\nand secondary side of the proposed GD is measured by Tektronix\nHV differential probe THDP0100; the CM current through\nFig. 18. CMTI test setup.\nproposed GD icm is measured by Pearson Electronics current\nmonitor 2877.\nFig. 19(a)–(c) shows CMTI testing waveforms. The static\nCMTI testing waveforms with PWM signal tied to logic low\n(D = 0%) and logic high ( D = 100%) are shown in Fig. 19(a)\nand (b), respectively. The dynamic CMTI testing waveform with\nD =50% and 40 kHz PWM frequency is shown in Fig. 19(c). It\nis important to note that no CM choke is added into the proposed\nGD during CMTI tests, the proposed GD operates normally\nwithout false-triggering or missing pulses. Transient waveforms\nduring rising and falling intervals of vcm are shown in Fig. 19(d)\nand (e), respectively. The maximum rising and falling dv/dt of\nvcm are 106 V/ns and 101 V/ns, respectively, but vdr of the\nproposed GD still remains clear and stable during transients.\nTherefore, it is concluded that the proposed GD has a CMTI >\n100 V/ns, which is qualiﬁed for MV SiC MOSFET applications.\nWith the measured peak icm and maximum rising and falling\ndv/dt,t h e Ccp of the proposed GD is extracted as 5.85 pF. This\nresult is slightly larger than Q3D simulation result (i.e., 5 pF),\nwhich may be caused by the coupling effect of different PCBs.\nIn the real application, CM chokes can be further utilized to\nsuppress the CM noise current to enhance the GD’s robustness.\nE. Switching Performance V eriﬁcations for 3.3 and 10 kV SiC\nMOSFETS\nThe multiple pulse test (MPT) is ﬁrst conducted on 3.3 kV\ndiscrete SiC MOSFET and 10 kV SiC MOSFET half-bridge power\nmodule, respectively, to demonstrate their dynamic switching\nperformance with proposed GD. The continuous operation of\nproposed GD is then veriﬁed on 10 kV SiC MOSFET half-bridge\npower module.\nThe MPT testbed schematic is shown in Fig. 20(a). The photos\nof MPT testbed for 3.3 kV SiC MOSFET GR40MT33N and 10 kV\nSiC MOSFET half-bridge power module are shown in Fig. 20(b)\nand (c), respectively. The proposed GD is used to drive the upper\nswitch S1, where the galvanic isolation and CMTI to the high\ndv/dt is more challenging.\nMPT waveform for 3.3 kV SiC MOSFET is shown in Fig. 21(a),\nwhere Vdc = 2k V , id_S1,max = 45 A, Rgon = 2.5 Ω, Rgoﬀ =\n3.3 Ω, Lload = 1.3 mH, Cbus = 80 μF, and Cdec = 940 nF.\nZoomed switching transients are shown in Fig. 21(b) and (c).\nThe maximum turn- ON dv/dt of S1 is 92 V/ns occurring at\nzero load current, and the maximum turn- OFF dv/dt of S1 is\n9424 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 37, NO. 8, AUGUST 2022\nFig. 19.

The maximum turn- OFF dv/dt of S1\noccurs at the maximum load current (i.e., 60 A) and it can reach\n80 V/ns. Figs. 21 and 22 have demonstrated that the proposed\nGD is free of false-triggering, missing pulse or undesired delay\nwhen driving 3.3 kV and 10 kV SiC MOSFETs under high dv/dt.\nThe existing DESAT protection method for 10 kV SiCMOSFET\nis applied to the proposed GD. Using MPT testbed of Fig. 20(c),\nan overcurrent (OC) fault is tested on the upper switch S1 at\n5-kV dc-link voltage. The experimental waveform is presented\nin Fig. 23. The DESAT protection is activated when S1 current\nreaches OC protection threshold 75 A.

C ONCLUSION\nThis article presents a 20 MHz-pulse-transformer isolated\nGD with the signal-power integrated transmission for MV SiC\n9426 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS, VOL. 37, NO. 8, AUGUST 2022\nMOSFETs. The proposed GD transmits both the PWM signal\nand GD power simultaneously, so isolated GDPSs and FOs are\nnot required, which reduces the size and cost of GD for MV\nSiC MOSFETs. The proposed GD utilizes two 20 MHz class-E\nRFCs in the IPOP architecture and complementary operation\nmanners to transmit a constant GD power with varied PWM\nduty cycle. The proposed GD can achieve a total propagation\ndelay time < 75 ns, which is enabled by 20 MHz operation\nand edge-based signal-processing circuits. The active clamping\ncircuit is proposed to avoid the false PWM regeneration, which\nensures the proposed GD operate within full PWM duty-cycle\nrange. The PCB-based coreless transformer is integrated into the\nproposed GD with an insulating voltage higher than 10 kV RMS\nand a low Ccp of 5.85 pF. A prototype of the proposed GD has\nbeen developed in laboratory with a small footprint (51 mm\n× 36 mm). The CMTI of proposed GD is characterized as >\n100 V/ns at 2 kV CM voltage. The proposed GD can drive\nMV SiC devices with the desired timing and driving voltage\nof +15 V/ −5 V . The experimental results have veriﬁed the\nvalidity of proposed GD for 3.3 kV and 10 kV SiC MOSFETs.\nThe proposed GD can also be applied to other voltage (e.g.,\n6.5 kV) rated MV SiC MOSFET.\nREFERENCES\n[1] S.
