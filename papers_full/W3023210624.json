    "abstract": "The distribution electric grid has become a highly complex and intelligent network with changing load and customer types. This has generated unprecedented challenges and opportunities for utility companies–opportunities especially in the area of asset health/performance management. Moreover, several utilities are increasingly moving from the traditional reactive and time-based asset monitoring approach to a more proactive condition based method. However, this needs to be done in a low-cost and efficient manner. Here, this paper explores how existing sensor infrastructure such as smart meters can be utilized to provide utility operators with more visibility into the health and operation of their assets. The paper focuses primarily on service transformers.",
