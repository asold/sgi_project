The series is intended\nto help such people ensure that their decisions are well-informed\nby the best available research evidence. The SUPPORT tools\nand the ways in which they can be used are described in more\ndetail in the Introduction to this series [1]. A glossary for the\nentire series is attached to each article (see Additional File 1).\nLinks to Spanish, Portuguese, French and Chinese translations\nof this series can be found on the SUPPORT website http://\nwww.support-collaboration.org. Feedback about how to\nimprove the tools in this series is welcome and should be sent to:\nSTP@nokc.no.\nScenarios\nScenario 1: You are a senior civil servant and have been invited\nto a policy dialogue about an issue that is of growing interest to\nthe Minister. You are concerned about whether the policy dia-\nlogue is being organised in way that will inform different ele-\nments of the issue, and recognises the importance of drawing on\nboth research evidence and stakeholder views and experiences.\nYou also want to ensure that the policy dialogue does not con-\nclude with a recommendation that is politically or economically\nunfeasible and hence potentially awkward for the Minister con-\ncerned.\nScenario 2: You work in the Ministry of Health and have been\ngiven a few hours to prepare an assessment of a planning doc-\nument for a policy dialogue that will address a high-priority\nissue for the Ministry. All that you have been told is that this\npolicy dialogue is different in a number of ways from the type\nof stakeholder engagement processes that you have organised in\nthe past for the Ministry, including how it will be informed by\na pre-circulated summary of the best available research evi-\ndence on the problem, options to address it, and implementa-\ntion considerations.\nScenario 3: You work in an independent unit that supports the\nMinistry of Health in its use of research evidence in policymak-\ning. You are organising a policy dialogue for senior Ministry\nofficials and key stakeholders to deliberate about a problem,\noptions to address it, and implementation considerations. You\nhave been told to organise the policy dialogue in a way that is\nlikely to enhance its potential impact, but you want guidance on\nhow to do so.\nBackground\nFor policymakers (Scenario 1), this article suggests a\nnumber of questions that they might ask their staff to con-\nsider when deciding whether to participate in a policy dia-\nlogue or how to maximise the value of a policy dialogue\nthat they are sponsoring. For those who support policy-\nmakers (Scenarios 2 and 3), this article suggests a number\nof questions to guide their assessment of a plan for a pol-\nicy dialogue or their organisation of one.\nThere has been growing interest in identifying interactive\nknowledge-sharing mechanisms that allow research evi-\ndence to be brought together with the views, experiences\nand tacit knowledge of those who will be involved in, or\naffected by, future decisions about high-priority issues\n[2,3]. This interest has been fuelled by a number of devel-\nopments:\n1. The recognition of the need for locally contextualised\n'decision support' for policymakers and other stakehold-\ners [4,5]\n2. The recognition that research evidence is only one input\ninto the decision-making processes of policymakers and\nother stakeholders [6,7]\n3. The recognition that many stakeholders can add signif-\nicant value to these processes [8,9], and\n4. The recognition that many stakeholders can take action\nto address high-priority issues - not just policymakers\nPolicy dialogues constitute a promising 'interactive\nknowledge-sharing mechanism'. The development of\nthese dialogues has been informed, at least in part, by\nfindings from two systematic reviews of the factors influ-\nencing the use of research evidence in policymaking\n[10,11]. While the reviews identified that research in this\nfield was not extensive, rigorous or consistent, a few fac-\ntors did emerge consistently:\n• Higher levels of interaction between researchers and\npolicymakers increased the likelihood of research evi-\ndence being used (particularly when the interactions were\nbased on informal relationships). Conversely, a lack of\ninteraction decreased the likelihood of research evidence\nbeing used\n Timeliness increased the likelihood of research evidence\nbeing used in policymaking, while a lack of timeliness\ndecreased this likelihood\n The likelihood of research evidence being used in poli-\ncymaking increased when available research evidence\naccorded with the beliefs, values, interests or political\ngoals and strategies of politicians, civil servants and stake-\nholders (or when particular political stances had not yet\nbeen decided). Conversely, a lack of accord decreased the\nprobability of research evidence being used.\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S14 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S14\nPage 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nPolicy dialogues have the potential to improve the use of\nresearch by shaping the factors listed above. This potential\ncan be realised through support related directly to:\n1. Interactions between researchers and policymakers\n(and among a wider range of stakeholders who are able to\ntake action)\n2. The timely identification and interpretation of the\navailable research evidence (when a policy dialogue is\norganised urgently to address a high-priority issue), and\n3. The 'real time' identification of accord between research\nevidence and the beliefs, values, interests or political goals\nand strategies of policymakers and stakeholders.\nTable 1 provides a simple framework for distinguishing\nthe differences between 'dialogue' and 'debate'. While dia-\nlogue is the goal of policy dialogues, debate does not typi-\ncally offer suitable opportunities for the support of\nconstructive interaction and the identification of shared\nground. This does not mean that debate does not have a\ncritical and complementary role in policymaking. Indeed,\nforums are also needed to enable contesting value posi-\ntions to be articulated. In these, the extent and quality of\nthe research evidence supporting alternative problem def-\ninitions, options, and implementation strategies (sup-\nported by very different value positions) can be publicly\npresented and debated.\nModels for policy dialogues can be distinguished in three\nways both from each other and from other stakeholder\nengagement processes in terms of their:\n Goals - which can include information sharing, net-\nworking, discussion, consensus statement development,\nand action planning about related goals and/or processes\n Group composition, and\n Group processes - which can includes pre- and post-cir-\nculated materials and format (e.g. concurrent delibera-\ntions in several groups or sequential deliberations in a\nsingle group, and rules)\nConsiderable attention has been paid to these distinctions\n(and their implications) in public engagement initiatives\n[12,13] and in clinical practice guideline development\n[14-16]. For example, researchers have developed an evi-\ndence base to inform choices about the design of guide-\nline development processes. This includes approaches to\npanel composition, the format of pre-circulated evidence\nsummaries, and consensus rules [17].\nFar less attention has been given to the benefits, harms\nand costs of alternative approaches to policy dialogues\nthat seek to support evidence-informed policymaking, or\nto support other types of evidence-informed action\nrelated to health systems. A systematic review found no\nrigorous evaluations of the effects of policy dialogues [3].\nHowever, the review did identify a variety of policy dia-\nlogue characteristics that appear promising, including\nconsultation with all parties affected by an outcome, the\nfair representation of scientists and stakeholders, high-\nquality syntheses of the scientific evidence, and skilful\nchairing [2,3]. Our own formative evaluation of a policy\ndialogue that involved policymakers, civil society groups\nand researchers from 20 low- and middle-income coun-\ntries found that pre-circulated evidence summaries,\nskilled facilitation, the application of the Chatham House\nRule (prohibiting the attribution of particular com-\nments), and a lack of emphasis on achieving consensus,\nwere among the highly-valued design features [18].\nQuestions to consider\nThe following questions can guide how to organise and\nuse policy dialogues to support evidence-informed policy-\nmaking:\n1. Does the dialogue address a high-priority issue?\n2. Does the dialogue provide opportunities to discuss the\nproblem, options to address the problem, and key imple-\nmentation considerations?\n3. Is the dialogue informed by a pre-circulated policy brief\nand by a discussion about the full range of factors that can\ninfluence the policymaking process?\n4. Does the dialogue ensure fair representation among\nthose who will be involved in, or affected by, future deci-\nsions related to the issue?\nTable 1: Differences between dialogue and debate\nDialogue Debate\nCollaborative Oppositional\nCommon ground Winning\nEnlarges perspectives Affirms perspectives\nSearches for agreement Searches for differences\nCauses introspection Causes critique\nLooks for strengths Looks for weaknesses\nRe-evaluates assumptions Defends assumptions\nListening for meaning Lis tening for countering\nRemains open-ended Implies a conclusion\nSource: Adapted from the Co-Intelligence Institute and appearing in \nJones CM, Mittelmark MB.

Does the dialogue engage a facilitator, follow a rule\nabout not attributing comments to individuals, and not\naim for consensus?\n6. Are outputs produced and follow-up activities under-\ntaken to support action?\n1. Does the dialogue address a high-priority issue?\nPolicy dialogues should ideally address an issue consid-\nered high priority by some or all stakeholders. If a partic-\nular issue has been on the agenda of key stakeholders for\nsome time, then policy dialogues, like policy briefs (dis-\ncussed further in Article 13 in this series), may act as a way\nto spur action [19]. The Evidence-Informed Policy Net-\nwork (EVIPNet) in both Burkina Faso and Cameroon, for\nexample, convened a national policy dialogue to address\nthe long-standing challenge of low coverage rates for\nartemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) to treat\nuncomplicated falciparum malaria. If an issue in a policy\nbrief is relatively new, then the associated policy dialogue\nmay potentially play an agenda-setting role. But irrespec-\ntive of whether it does so or not, the focus of a policy dia-\nlogue would always ideally be an issue deemed to be a\npriority by at least some key stakeholders.\nThe process of obtaining consensus on the selection of a\npriority issue for a policy dialogue, however, may leave\norganisers hostage to policymakers and stakeholders who\nsupport the status quo or are seeking to avoid change.\nIssues related to obtaining consensus on how a problem\ncan best be clarified or options best framed, may also priv-\nilege those seeking to avoid change. Such groups may be\nalso be privileged by the choice of dialogue invitees or\nfacilitator, and decisions related to follow-up activities to\nsupport action. (These concerns from the focus of Ques-\ntions 2 to 6 below).\nWhile our focus in this article is primarily on policy dia-\nlogues organised with the active engagement of existing\npolitical regimes, other policy dialogue scenarios are pos-\nsible. These may include dialogues organised by those\nworking with opposition leaders, 'shadow' health minis-\nters, and others who might not share the prevailing ortho-\ndoxy about what constitutes a high-priority issue or a\nfeasible set of approaches to addressing it.\nBecause of the way in which priorities change, the timing\nof policy dialogues is also often critical. In order to\naddress issues when they are considered a high priority\nand 'windows of opportunity' for change are evident, it\nmay be necessary to organise policy dialogues rapidly.\n2. Does the dialogue provide opportunities to discuss the \nproblem, options to address the problem, and key \nimplementation considerations?\nPolicy dialogues, like policy briefs, focus on:\n1. Different features of a problem, including (where pos-\nsible) how it affects particular groups\n2. Options to address the problem, and\n3. Key implementation considerations\nDuring policy dialogues, participants may conclude that\nnone of the options are optimal. In these instances, they\nmay advocate 'borrowing' additional features from other\noptions in order to create a new hybrid (or 'bundled')\noption. Dialogues may also be convened at different\nstages of the policymaking process, giving greater focus to\nproblem definition earlier in the process and to implemen-\ntation later.\nPolicy briefs present the best available synthesised research\nevidence. But (as described in Article 13 in the series) they\ndo not speak explicitly to potential actions based on that\nevidence [19]. Policy dialogues, in contrast, can do this.\nThe focus, in these instances, could be on working\nthrough what actions can be taken individually (by a poli-\ntician, for example) and collectively (by a coalition, for\ninstance, of health professional associations). The fact\nthat this may be done 'collectively', however, does not\nimply that everyone will be included. It may instead mean\nthat only several of the groups whose members are partic-\nipating in a policy dialogue will move forward collec-\ntively. And as we discuss below, consensus on the type of\ncollective action chosen is usually not actively sought.\n3. Is the dialogue informed by a pre-circulated policy brief \nand by a discussion about the full range of factors that can \ninfluence the policymaking process?\nA policy brief, as described in Article 13 in this series, is a\nhighly efficient way of introducing global and local\nresearch evidence about a problem [19]. It also provides\noptions to address a problem, as well as introducing key\nimplementation considerations to dialogue participants.\nThe goal of a policy dialogue is to support the full discus-\nsion of relevant considerations (including research evi-\ndence) about a high-priority issue in order to inform\npolicymaking and other types of action. Dialogues pro-\nvide a vehicle for harnessing many types of information\nand creating locally contextualised knowledge that can\ninform policymaking and other types of action.\nTo ensure that key relevant research evidence is taken into\naccount, it is important to have policy briefs pre-circu-\nlated. This is also critical because policy briefs provide\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S14 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S14\nPage 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ncommon ground from which discussions about the issues\ncan be launched. At the start of each set of deliberations\n(about a problem, options and implementation consider-\nations, respectively), highlights from the corresponding\nsection of a policy brief may be introduced informally.\nThese final highlights would ideally be informally pre-\nsented and discussed. The alternative of a more formal\nmethod of presentation may give some participants the\nimpression that research evidence constitutes the sole\nfocus of the deliberations, or takes precedence over other\nconsiderations. A final round of deliberations focusing on\nwho may be able to support the implementation of possi-\nble actions has no corresponding written section in a pol-\nicy brief.\nWhile research evidence can be codified in the form of a\npolicy brief, it is perhaps the views, experiences and tacit\nknowledge of those who will be involved in, or affected\nby, future decisions about a high-priority issue that can\nbest emerge spontaneously in the course of a policy dia-\nlogue. Dialogue participants would ideally be invited to\nintroduce their own understanding about factors that\nneed to be considered. These include on-the-ground real-\nities and constraints, the values and beliefs of citizens and\ncommunities, the power dynamics among interest groups,\ninstitutional constraints, and considerations related to\n'external' factors (such as the broader economy or, in the\ncase of low- and middle-income countries, the strategic\npriorities of donors). These understandings are particu-\nlarly important given that they shape participant\napproaches to a problem, the options they may choose to\naddress the problem, the implementation of the options,\nand future decisions related to who should undertake par-\nticular actions.\n4. Does the dialogue ensure fair representation among \nthose who will be involved in or affected by future \ndecisions related to the issue?\nA policy dialogue would ideally bring together the many\nparties involved in, or affected by, future decisions related\nto a high-priority issue in order to ensure fair representa-\ntion. As a first step, this requires the careful mapping of\nthe full range of stakeholders related to the issue at hand.\nStakeholder mapping may be achieved by creating an\ninventory of role categories specific to the issue. Those\ninvolved could include:\n Policymakers (including elected officials, political staff\nor civil servants) in the national government and/or in\nsub-national governments if independent public policy-\nmaking authority related to the issue exists at the sub-\nnational level. These policymakers may be drawn from\nmany different departments, and not just health or\nfinance departments\n Managers in districts/regions, healthcare institutions\n(e.g. hospitals), and non-governmental organisations,\nand other relevant types of organisations\n Staff or members of civil society groups, which could\ninclude consumer groups, health professional associa-\ntions, and industry associations, among others, and\n Researchers in national research institutions, universi-\nties, and from other jurisdictions.\nIn some countries, individuals may play several of these\nroles concurrently (or have played them sequentially).\nAs a second step, individuals will need to be carefully\nselected from the role categories above. Two criteria may\nbe useful:\n1. The ability of the individuals to articulate the views and\nexperiences of a particular constituency on the issue,\nwhile constructively engaging at the same time with par-\nticipants drawn from other constituencies and learning\nfrom them, and\n2. The ability of the individuals to champion the actions\nthat will address the issue within their constituencies\nDifferent political systems will have different traditions\nrelating to which individuals - and how many individuals\n- will be invited to meetings to discuss high-priority issues.\nIt may or may not be possible, or desirable, to adapt a tra-\ndition for a specific policy dialogue. But when determin-\ning the number of invitees, a key consideration should be\nthe balanced representation of all key constituencies, on\none hand, and the opportunity for all individuals to con-\ntribute, on the other hand. A total of between fifteen and\ntwenty participants might achieve such a balance for some\nissues and in some contexts. A group twice this size might\nbe needed for other issues and in other contexts. In some\nFrench-speaking African countries, for example, EVIPNet\nteams have organised policy dialogues that were even\nlarger (this is discussed further in Table 2). In order to\nallow all individuals to contribute in these instances, the\nlocal organisers included frequent concurrent delibera-\ntions among subgroups.\nInvitation letters to policy dialogue can prove critical to\nengaging key individuals. The title for a policy dialogue\nwould ideally be worded in a way that will engage invited\npolicymakers and stakeholders and may, for example,\ntake the form of a compelling question. The invitation let-\nter would ideally provide a list of those involved in plan-\nning the dialogue and a list of funders (of the organisation\nconvening the dialogue and of the dialogue itself), as well\nas their affiliations.\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S14 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S14\nPage 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n5. Does the dialogue engage a facilitator, follow a rule \nabout not attributing comments to individuals, and not \naim for consensus?\nA skilled, knowledgeable and neutral facilitator is\nrequired to ensure that a policy dialogue is run well. Skill\nis needed to keep the deliberations focused on the issue at\nhand, to ensure that all dialogue participants have a voice\nin the deliberations, and to challenge constructively any\npossible misinterpretations of the issue under discussion,\nand evidence of the other factors that may influence deci-\nsion making. It is particularly important for the facilitator\nto guard against the possibility that perceptions about the\nrelative status of participants (whether based on position\nin an organisation, educational background or other fac-\ntors) or other considerations such as language barriers, do\nnot privilege some participants in the dialogue over oth-\ners. An intermediate level of knowledge about the issue at\nhand and the local context is required in order to interpret\nthe contributions of the policy brief and to manage the\ndynamics during the deliberations. Neutrality is also\nrequired in order to ensure that all participants perceive\nthe dialogue as a 'safe harbour' for deliberation and not as\na vehicle for facilitators to steer deliberations in a direc-\ntion that they may prefer.\nArranging such a safe space for deliberation requires some\ncommonly agreed rules to reassure individuals that they\nmay speak frankly and without fear of repercussion in the\nmedia - or elsewhere - for having done so. Many policy\ndialogues follow the Chatham House Rule: \"Participants\nare free to use the information received during the meet-\ning, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the\nspeaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be\nrevealed\" http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/about/\nchathamhouserule/. This rule ensures that dialogue par-\nticipants feel empowered to act on what they have learned\nwhile knowing that their contributions will not be used to\nhurt them in the future.\nNot aiming for consensus may seem paradoxical at first.\nBut this is an important provision for many policymakers\nand stakeholders. Policymakers are ultimately responsible\nfor setting policies. Therefore, while actual policy develop-\nment typically occurs through a complex set of interac-\ntions involving government officials and stakeholders,\nmost policymakers would be very hesitant to commit\nthemselves to one approach after only a single dialogue,\nor without the opportunity to confer with policymakers in\nother parts of government or with other stakeholders.\nSimilarly, some stakeholders will need to return to their\ngroups or organisations in order to decide what actions\nthe groups or organisations should take. All of this said,\nalthough seeking consensus may not be an appropriate\ngoal in most contexts, consensus can and probably should\nbe embraced if it emerges spontaneously.\n6. Are outputs produced and follow-up activities \nundertaken to support action?\nAction to improve health is the preferred outcome for pol-\nicy dialogues, and therefore mechanisms are needed to\nequip both dialogue participants and others with the tools\nto support such action. As a minimum, both the policy\nbrief and a high-level summary of the policy dialogue (i.e.\na summary of key points rather than a detailed report)\nshould be actively disseminated. The dialogue summary\nwould need to remain true to the Chatham House Rule\nthat requires comments not to be attributed to identified\nindividuals or to individuals with identified affiliations.\nUnder this same rule, the dialogue summary may not\ninclude a list of dialogue participants.\nAdditional steps can also be taken to support any required\naction. For example, the McMaster Health Forum, a uni-\nversity-based convenor of policy dialogues:\n1. Offers dialogue participants the opportunity to partici-\npate in a brief video interview in which they can describe\nthe insights drawn from the dialogue, or the actions they\nsee as critical to addressing a high-priority issue. At the\nsame time, it is made clear to them that their personal\nchoice to relax the way in which the Chatham House Rule\napplies to them does not alter the way in which the rule\napplies to others\n2. Offers a personalised briefing about the implications of\nthe dialogue to key stakeholder groups in order to support\nTable 2: Policy dialogues about improving malaria treatment\nTwo EVIPNet teams, one in Burkina Faso and one in Cameroon, convened national policy dialogues to support a full discussion of relevant \nconsiderations (including research evidence) about how to support the widespread use of artemisinin-based combination therapy to treat \nuncomplicated falciparum malaria.\nThe dialogue in Burkina Faso brought together 38 stakeholders in May 2008 to discuss this problem, three options to address it, and key \nimplementation considerations. The insights derived from the policy dialogue directly informed the preparation of the Burkina Faso government's \nsuccessful application to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.\nHeld in January 2009, the dialogue in Cameroon included almost twice the number of stakeholders involved in Burkina Faso, and worked through \nthe particular features of the same problem of malaria treatment in Cameroon, three options appropriate to the problem, as well as related \nimplementation considerations. This group was divided into four smaller 'working groups' for each set of deliberations. The dialogue received \nsignificant media attention and increased the likelihood of meaningful action in the following months.\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S14 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S14\nPage 7 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntheir understanding of what the policy brief and dialogue\nsummary mean for them, and\n3. Offers a year-long evidence service that brings to atten-\ntion newly published or newly identified systematic\nreviews. This provides added momentum to proposed\nactions or the need for changes. The video interviews and\nevidence service are all posted on the Forum's website to\ninspire and inform others.\nAs with all efforts in this nascent domain, such follow-up\nactivities warrant further evaluation.\nOver time, consideration can be given to how policy dia-\nlogues might 'fit' with the rest of an evidence-informed\npolicymaking process and whether they can become the\nnorm for important issues.\nConclusion\nPolicy dialogues represent a new and evolving approach\nto supporting evidence-informed policymaking. They are\none of many forms of political interaction that could use-\nfully be more evidence-informed. The organisation and\nuse of policy dialogues continues to evolve through prac-\ntical experience. Evaluations of this approach are needed\nin order to improve our understanding of which particular\ndesign features and follow-up activities are well received\nfor particular types of issues and in particular types of con-\ntexts. For example, the Chatham House Rule may be per-\nceived as being particularly important for highly\npoliticised topics. Similarly, the objective of not aiming for\nconsensus may be perceived as inappropriate in political\nsystems that have a long tradition of civil society engage-\nment in policymaking. Evaluations are also necessary as a\nway of improving our understanding of whether, and\nhow, policy dialogues and related follow-up activities\nsupport evidence-informed policymaking. Table 3 pro-\nvides a description of one approach to the formative eval-\nuation of policy dialogues.\nResources\nUseful documents and further reading\n- Lomas J, Culyer T, McCutcheon C, McAuley L, Law S:\nConceptualizing and Combining Evidence for Health System\nTable 3: An example of an approach to the formative evaluation of policy dialogues\n• The McMaster Health Forum surveys participants in all of the policy dialogues it convenes and has the long-term goal of identifying which particular \ndesign features work best for which particular types of issues and in which types of health system contexts. Participation is voluntary, confidentiality \nis assured, and anonymity safe-guarded\n• Dialogues are characterised by twelve features and these are the focus of the questions in the formative evaluation survey. A dialogue:\n• Addresses a high-priority issue\n• Provides an opportunity to discuss different features of the problem, including (where possible) how these affect particular groups\n• Provides an opportunity to discuss three options to address the policy issue\n• Provides an opportunity to discuss key implementation considerations\n• Provides an opportunity to discuss who might take what action\n• Is informed by a pre-circulated evidence brief that mobilises both global and local research evidence about the problem, three options to \naddress the problem, and key implementation considerations\n• Is informed by a discussion about the full range of factors that can inform how to approach the problem, options to address the problem, and \nthe implementation of these options\n• Brings together many parties who would be involved in, or affected by, future decisions related to the issue\n• Ensures fair representation among policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers\n• Engages a facilitator to assist with the deliberations\n• Allows for frank, off-the-record deliberations by following the Chatham House Rule: \"Participants are free to use the information received \nduring the meeting, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed\", and\n• Does not aim for consensus\n• For each design feature the survey asks:\n• How useful did they find this approach on a scale ranging from 1 (Worthless) to 7 (Useful)?\n• Comments and suggestions for improvement?\n• The survey also asks:\n• How well did the policy dialogue achieve its purpose, namely to support a full discussion of relevant considerations (including research \nevidence) about a high-priority issue in order to inform action on a scale from 1 (Failed) to 7 (Achieved)?\n• What features of the dialogue should be retained in future?\n• What features of the dialogue should be changed in future?\n• What others can do better or differently to address the high-priority issue and what they personally can do better or differently?\n• Their role and background \n(so that the McMaster Health Forum can determine if different groups have different views about, and experiences with, the dialogues)\n• The McMaster Health Forum also plans to conduct brief follow-up surveys six months after a dialogue, with the objective of identifying what, if \nany, actions have been undertaken by dialogue participants and what, if any, impacts have been achieved. Here again, participation is voluntary, \nconfidentiality is assured, and anonymity safeguarded\n• The Evidence-Informed Policy Networks (EVIPNet) operating in Africa, Asia and the Americas plan to use a similar approach in the formative \nevaluation of their policy dialogues\nPublish with BioMed Central   and  every \nscientist can read your work free of charge\n\"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for \ndisseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\"\nSir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK\nYour research papers will be:\navailable free of charge to the entire biomedical community\npeer reviewed and published immediately upon acceptance\ncited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central \nyours — you keep the copyright\nSubmit your manuscript here:\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/info/publishing_adv.asp\nBioMedcentral\nHealth Research Policy and Systems 2009, 7(Suppl 1):S14 http://www.health-po licy-systems.com/content/7/S1/S14\nPage 8 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nGuidance.
