Previous reports estimated that approximately 10% of its 6.6 Mbp\ngenome varies from strain to strain and is therefore referred to as“accessory genome”. Elements within the\naccessory genome ofP. aeruginosa have been associated with differences in virulence and antibiotic resistance. As\nwhole genome sequencing of bacterial strains becomes more widespread and cost-effective, methods to quickly\nand reliably identify accessory genomic elements in newly sequencedP. aeruginosa genomes will be needed.\nResults: We developed a bioinformatic method for identifying the accessory genome ofP. aeruginosa. First, the\ncore genome was determined based on sequence conserved among the completed genomes of twelve reference\nstrains using Spine, a software program developed for this purpose. The core genome was 5.84 Mbp in size and\ncontained 5,316 coding sequences. We then developed anin silico genome subtraction program named AGEnt to\nfilter out core genomic sequences fromP. aeruginosa whole genomes to identify accessory genomic sequences of\nthese reference strains. This analysis determined that the accessory genome ofP. aeruginosa ranged from 6.9-18.0%\nof the total genome, was enriched for genes associated with mobile elements, and was comprised of a majority of\ngenes with unknown or unclear function. Using these genomes, we showed that AGEnt performed well compared\nto other publically available programs designed to detect accessory genomic elements. We then demonstrated the\nutility of the AGEnt program by applying it to the draft genomes of two previously unsequencedP. aeruginosa\nstrains, PA99 and PA103.\nConclusions: The P. aeruginosa genome is rich in accessory genetic material. The AGEnt program accurately\nidentified the accessory genomes of newly sequencedP. aeruginosa strains, even when draft genomes were used.\nAs P. aeruginosa genomes become available at an increasingly rapid pace, this program will be useful in cataloging\nthe expanding accessory genome of this bacterium and in discerning correlations between phenotype and\naccessory genome makeup. The combination of Spine and AGEnt should be useful in defining the accessory\ngenomes of other bacterial species as well.\nKeywords: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Core genome, Accessory genome, Comparative genomics, Spine, AGEnt,\nWhole-genome sequencing\n* Correspondence:e-ozer@northwestern.edu\n1Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Northwestern\nUniversity, 645 North Michigan Avenue, Suite 900, Chicago, IL 60611, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2014 Ozer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Genomics2014, 15:737\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/737\nBackground\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium\nubiquitously found in the environment. The organism dis-\nplays a striking propensity for survival in highly diverse\necological niches and causes infections in a wide range of\nhost organisms, including plants, nematodes, insects, and\nvertebrates [1]. As an opportunistic pathogen in humans,\nP. aeruginosa primarily causes infections in individuals\nwith compromised host defenses, such as burn patients,\nthose requiring mechanical ventilation, and patients with\nimmune deficiencies [2-5]. The key to its survival in di-\nverse environments as well as its broad infectious host\nrange lies in its metabolic versatility and adaptability. For\nexample, P. aeruginosacan utilize multiple carbon sources\nfor energy, respire under aerobic and anaerobic condi-\ntions, grow at temperatures up to 42°C, form biofilms,\nand resist many biocides and antibiotics [6-8]. Reflective\nof this diversity,P. aeruginosa has one of the largest ge-\nnomes among bacterial human pathogens, averaging\n6.6 Mbp in size. As opposed to other bacterial species with\nexpanded genomes representing gene duplication events\n[9], the genome ofP. aeruginosa is made up of an assort-\nment of genes encoding functionally diverse products.\nThis includes a large number of genes encoding outer\nmembrane proteins, transport systems, and enzymes in-\nvolved in nutrient uptake and metabolism, as well as one\nof the largest proportions of regulatory genes (8.4%)\namong bacterial genomes [10].\nThe increasing availability of multiple genome sequences\nhas made comparative genomic analyses ofP. aeruginosa\npossible. T h e s ea n a l y s e sh a v ed e f i n e dac o n s e r v e d“core”\ngenome shared among nearly all members of the species\ninterspersed with “accessory” genomic elements that are\npresent in some but absent in other strains ofP. aerugi-\nnosa. Prior studies suggest that the core genome represents\napproximately 90% of the totalP. aeruginosagenome and\nis highly conserved [11], containing the majority of genes\nwith housekeeping functions [12]. The accessory genome\nof P. aeruginosa consists of variable-length stretches of\nDNA separated by core genome segments. These accessory\nelements are sometimes referred to as genomic islands\n(>10 kb) or islets (<10 kb), although the definitions of these\nterms are evolving to refer more specifically to genetic\nmaterial with signatures suggesting horizontal transfer\n[13-15]. To avoid confusion,we will use the term accessory\ngenomic element (AGE) to indicate any contiguous stretch\nof genetic material that is not a part of the conserved core\ngenome, regardless of its source or structure. Major com-\nponents of theP. aeruginosaaccessory genome are integra-\ntive and conjugative elements (ICEs), replacement islands,\nprophages and phage-like elements, transposons, insertion\nsequences, and integrons [16]. Extra-chromosomal plas-\nmids, harbored by some strains ofP. aeruginosa,may also\nbe considered part of the accessory genome.\nThe accessory genome of an individualP. aeruginosa\nstrain is an important driver of its ability to persist in a\nparticular environment. For instance, genes found in the\naccessory genomes of strains cultured from sites con-\ntaining heavy metals and toxic organic compounds pro-\nmoted persistence in these environments, which are\notherwise unsuited for P. aeruginosa habitation [17,18].\nThe bacterial accessory genome can have important clin-\nical implications as well. In many bacteria, the accessory\ngenome is enriched in virulence genes [19], andP. aeru-\nginosa is no exception. A screen of accessory sequences\nin clinical strains ofP. aeruginosa showed several open\nreading frames encoding proteins with homologies to\nbacterial virulence factors not previously seen inP. aeru-\nginosa [20]. The P. aeruginosa genomic islands PAPI-1\nand PAPI-2 encode multiple genes necessary for full\nvirulence in animal and plant infection models [21]. For\nexample, PAPI-2 and related islands contain the gene\nencoding ExoU, a type-III-secreted effector protein\nlinked to increased virulence in animal models and hu-\nman patients [22-26]. Although intrinsic antibiotic re-\nsistance mechanisms are encoded within the core\ngenome of P. aeruginosa\n, acquired antibiotic resistance\ngenes are present in the accessory genome [27]. The\ntransfer of these genes between strains can contribute\nto outbreaks of multiply-anti biotic-resistant strains in\nhealthcare settings [28-31].\nIdentification of accessory genomic elements in P.\naeruginosa is important to the study of this organism’s\nevolution, niche adaptation, and infectious potential.\nWith advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS),\nthe sequencing of entire bacterial genomes is becoming\nfaster, cheaper, and more accurate. For example, complete\nor draft sequences of 73 strains ofP. aeruginosahad been\ndeposited in the NCBI database at the time of this writing.\nThus there is a need for a rapid method to reliably identify\naccessory genomic elements in newly sequenced strains\nof P. aeruginosa . Many analyses of bacterial core and\naccessory genomes to date have relied on annotation of\nquery genomes and time- and resource-intensive align-\nment analyses to identify homologous genes among\nmembers of the species [32-34]. Several bioinformatic\ntools have been developed to identify genomic islands\n(GIs) and other non-conserved genomic elements in\nbacteria, but they have suffered from a variety of limita-\ntions. Comparative-genomics-based tools compare the\nsequence of a query genome to one or more reference\ngenomic sequences to identify elements shared by or\ndiffering between the sequences. Examples of compara-\ntive genomics software applications include IslandPick\n[35], which uses sequential pair-wise alignments of the\nquery genome against each member of a group of phylo-\ngenetically related reference genomes to identify regions\nin the query genome not present in any of the accessory\nOzer et al. BMC Genomics2014, 15:737 Page 2 of 17\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/737\ngenomes, and Panseq [36,37], which builds a nucleotide\npangenome from the sequences of input genomes, then\nidentifies presence or absence of pangenome elements\nin the input sequences by BLAST alignment. Limita-\ntions of currently available software for core/accessory\ngenome analysis include restrictions on reference se-\nquences and query file inputs to finished genomes or\nthe inability to specifically isolate and output core and\naccessory sequences from query or reference genomes.\nThe results of these and other comparative genomics\nbased approaches will also be dependent on the selec-\ntion of comparator sequences. In cases where only few\npoor quality and/or homogeneous reference genomes\nare available for comparison to the query genome, ac-\ncurate and complete identification of core and accessory\nregions can be compromised.\nSeveral bioinformatic tools and approaches have been\ndeveloped to utilize sequence characteristics rather than\ncomparative genomics to identify accessory elements.\nMany of these methods rely on the observation that\nhorizontally-transferred elements will reflect the sequence\ncomposition of the donor genome and differ from the\nrecipient genome. For instance, SIGI-HMM [38] identi-\nfies regions of codon usage dissimilar from comparator\nspecies and IslandPath-DIMOB [39] examines query se-\nquence for the presence of flanking repeats, mobility\ngenes, nearby tRNAs, and atypical dinucleotide sequence\nto identify genomic regions that were potentially acquired\nby horizontal transfer. Other tools, such as Alien_hunter\n[40], use variable order compositional distributions in the\nquery genome to identify regions likely to have been hori-\nzontally transferred. These sequence-based approaches\navoid some pitfalls associated with comparative genomic\napproaches such as choice or availability of comparator\ngenomes. However, sequence-composition-based approaches\ncan suffer in situations where the composition of the donor\nand recipient genomes is similar, as in the case of older\nhorizontal-gene transfer events in which the sequence\ncomposition characteristics of the accessory element can\ncome to resemble the host after sufficient generations\n[41]. To try to address the limitations of the comparative\ngenomics and sequence-based approaches, some tools\nhave been developed that combine both approaches. For\ninstance, IslandViewer [42] combines the IslandPick,\nSIGI-HMM, and IslandPath-DIMOB algorithms to im-\nprove sensitivity of genomic island prediction in bacter-\nial genomic sequences.\nIn this study, we propose a new comparative genomics\napproach to identify accessory genomic elements in draft\ngenomes produced by NGS. We applied this approach,\nwhich addresses many of the limitations of currently\navailable programs, toP. aeruginosa. We first compared\ntwelve finished P. aeruginosa genomes to identify com-\nmon sequences that are defined as the core genome of\nthis bacterium. The core genome was then subtracted\nfrom the total sequences of these strains to identify their\naccessory genomes. Using this approach, we found that\nthe core genome of P. aeruginosa was 5.84 Mbp. The\naccessory genome ofP. aeruginosa accounted for 7-18%\nof the total genome and was enriched for genes associ-\nated with mobile genetic elements. We show the utility\nof this approach by applying it to two newly sequenced\nstrains ofP. aeruginosa: PA103 and PA99.\nResults\nDetermination of the core genome ofP. aeruginosa\nThe core genome of a bacterial species consists of those\nsequences conserved among members of that species.\nTo calculate the core genome ofP. aeruginosa,w eu s e d\ntwelve reference strains (B136-33, DK2, RP73, PAO1,\nPA14, PA7, LESB58, PACS2, M18, NCGM2.S1, 19BR, and\n213BR) for which a single completed or mostly-completed\nchromosome without gaps or large numbers of ambiguous\nbases was available in GenBank. Only completed genomic\nsequences were used to calculate the core genome to\nminimize the potential for core sequence to be excluded\nas the result of undersequencing or misassembly in in-\ncomplete draft sequences. One of these strains, M18, is an\nenvironmental isolate [43], whereas the remaining eleven\nare human clinical isolates from diverse body sites. The\ngenomes ranged in size between 6.26 and 6.76 Mbp (with\nan average size of 6.52 Mbp). To identify conserved se-\nquences among the reference strains, we aligned the ref-\nerence genomes using the NUCmer function of the\nMUMmer software package (Figure 1). The size of the\ncore genome as a function of the number of reference\ngenomes included in the analysis was calculated using\nan adaptation of the method described by Tettelin and\ncolleagues [32]. As expected,the average size of the core\ngenome decreased as more strains were included in the\nanalysis (Figure 2). Of note, two distinct clusters of core\ngenome size estimates were apparent, depending on\nwhich reference strains were included in the analysis\n(Figure 2). The cluster of smaller core genome sizes was\nobtained when strain PA7, a taxonomic outlier of theP.\naeruginosa species [44], was included in the analysis.\nSince it is relatively dissimilar to the other PA strains,\nthe apparent size of the core genome decreased mark-\nedly when PA7 was used to define the core genome.\nThe preceding analysis illustrates how inclusion of a\nsingle outlier strain can dramatically impact the size of\nt h ec o r eg e n o m eo fP. aeruginosa .T oe v a l u a t et h i s\nphenomenon further, we calculated the core genome\nsize based on varying definitions of the core genome:\nsequences shared by all strains, by at least eleven of the\ntwelve strains, by at least ten of the twelve strains, etc.\nT h ec o r eg e n o m es i z ei n c r e a s e ds u b s t a n t i a l l yw h e ns e -\nquences were allowed to be absent from one strain, but\nOzer et al. BMC Genomics2014, 15:737 Page 3 of 17\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/737\nmuch less so as further flexibility was introduced in\nthe definition of “core genome” (Figure 3). This sub-\nstantial difference was the result of 436 kb of DNA\nconserved among the other eleven reference strains\nbut absent from PA7. These sequences encode several\nfeatures characteristic of theP. aeruginosa species such\nas the exotoxin A gene,toxA. This again suggests that\ninclusion of outlier strain s can dramatically bias core\ngenome size. In other words, as u b s t a n t i a lp o r t i o no f\nt h eg e n o m et h a ti ss h a r e db yt h el a r g em a j o r i t yo fP.\naeruginosa isolates and therefore typical of its mem-\nbers may be excluded by inclusion of outlier strains.\nFor this reason, we hereafter define the core genome as\nthose sequences present in at least eleven of twelve\n(≥90%) of theP. aeruginosa reference genomes.\nCharacteristics of theP. aeruginosa core genome\nThe DNA sequence of the P. aeruginosa core genome,\nas defined by sequences present in≥90% of the reference\ngenomes, was extracted from the total sequence using\nthe script nucmer_backbone.pl, which parses the NUC-\nmer alignment data to generate a nucleotide sequence of\nFigure 1Approach to accessory genomic element\nidentification. Programs used to accomplish the listed steps are\nindicated by circled numbers: 1, 3, NUCmer (whole-genome aligner);\n2, nucmer_backbone.pl (converts coordinates of conserved regions\nto DNA sequence); 4, nucmer_difference.pl (subtracts regions not\naligning to core). See Methods section for further details.\nFigure 2Core genome analysis ofP. aeruginosa. The amount of\ncommon nucleotide sequence is plotted as a function of the number of\nstrains sequentially added (n). Gray circles represent core genome size\nwith each possible strain combination ofn genomes. Colored squares\nrepresent the average core genome size at eachn. The continuous curve\nshows the least-squares fit of an exponential decay function (R2 = 0.996).\nThe inset shows the size of the nucleotide pangenome as a function of\nthe number of strains sequentially added. The functions for both the\ncore genome and pangenome continuous best-fit curves were derived\nas described in Tettelin et al. [32].\nFigure 3The P. aeruginosa core genome size based on variable\ndefinition of“core” sequences. The nucleotide core genome size\nis plotted as a function of the minimum number of the twelve\nreference genomes in which a particular genomic element must be\npresent to be considered“core”. As flexibility is introduced into the\ndefinition of the core genome (i.e. an element is considered“core” if\nit is present in eleven of the twelve genomes, or ten of the twelve\ngenomes, etc.), the“core” genome size increases. A“core” genome\nrequirement of presence in only one of the twelve genomes therefore\nyields the pangenome of these twelve strains. Each symbol represents\nthe average core genome size of all possible permutations of genome\norders for twelve (12 permutations), eleven (132 permutations), and\nten (1320 permutations) genome minimums, and the average core\ngenome size for 10,000 randomly generated permutations at all other\nminimum genome numbers. Standard errors of the means at each\nvalue are too small to be visible at the scale of the figure.\nOzer et al. BMC Genomics2014, 15:737 Page 4 of 17\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/737\nthe core genome (Figure 1). The characteristics of theP.\naeruginosa core genome based on these twelve reference\ngenomes are presented in Table 1. The core genome\ncontains 5.84 Mbp of nucleotide sequence, representing\n89.7% (range: 86.4-93.3%) of the total genome. The aver-\nage G + C content of the core genome is 67.0%, com-\npared to 66.1– 66.6% of the complete reference genomes.\nThe total number of predicted genes contained within\nthe core genome sequence is 5,316 out of 5,892 (90%)\ntotal coding sequences in PA14 and 5,570 (95%) total\ncoding sequences in PAO1. As more completed genomes\nbecome available and are added to this analysis, it is antic-\nipated that the size of the core genome will decrease. A\ncurve fit to the data in Figure 2 suggests that the core gen-\nome size may plateau at approximately 5.10 Mbp, or 78%\nof theP. aeruginosagenome.\nThe cumulative genetic information within a bacte-\nrium’s genome is referred to as its pangenome. The size\nof the P. aeruginosa pangenome was a function of the\nnumber of reference strains included in the analysis,\nwith each additional strain contributing further genetic\ninformation to the pangenome (Figure 2, inset). Thus, as\nobserved by others [45],P. aeruginosa has a theoretically\nopen genome (i.e. the pangenome will continue to in-\ncrease in size with each additional strain sequenced). Ex-\ntrapolation of the best-fit line of the average pangenome\nsize as a function of genome number suggests that each\nadditional sequenced strain will yield 197 kb of novel\ngenetic information. Since our best-fit line is based on\nonly 12 strains, it is likely that this estimate will need\nto be revised as additional genome sequences become\navailable.\nCharacteristics of theP. aeruginosa accessory genome\nFollowing extraction of the core genome sequences, the\nremaining sequences of the twelve reference strains were\ndesignated the accessory genome. Since P. aeruginosa\nhas a theoretically open genome [45], these sequences in\nactuality represent only a small sampling of the entireP.\naeruginosa accessory genome, but nonetheless provide\ninsight into the features of these sequences. The average\nsize of the accessory genome of a P. aeruginosa strain\nwas 727 kbp, representing 11.1% (range: 6.9-18%) of the\ntotal genome (Table 1). Accessory genome G + C content\nwas lower than that of the core genome, averaging 61.2% for\nthe twelve reference strains. Among the reference genomes\nexamined, an average of 608 genes (range: 348-1,090) were\ncontained in the accessory genome of each strain. Although\nthe majority of accessory genomic segments are smaller\nthan 5 kb, contiguous accessory elements >100 kb in size\nwere identified (Figure 4).\nComparison of the core and accessory genomes\nThe accessory genome was enriched for a number of\nmobile genetic elements [16] (Table 1). Sequences with\nhomology to ICE and phage genes were concentrated in\nthe accessory portions of the referenceP. aeruginosa ge-\nnomes. In addition, several sequences associated with\ntype 1 integrons were found in the accessory genomes\nof the strains, but none were present in the core gen-\nome. Putative transposases were found in equal num-\nbers within both the accessory and core genomes; those\nTable 1P. aeruginosa core and accessory genome\ncharacteristics\nCorea Accessory\nAvg (range) Avg (range)\nSize (kbp) 5,844 727 (430 – 1,192)\n% of total genome 89.7 (86.4 – 93.3) 11.1 (6.9 – 18.0)\nAverage G + C % 67.0 61.2 (60.5 – 62.2)\nTotal # of genesb 5,316 608 (348 – 1,090)\nGene length (bp) 990 (72 – 13,029) 939 (51 – 17,019)\nOverlapping genesc (%) 28.3 33.8 (26.3 – 40.7)\nTransposasesd 76 ( 3 – 14)\nType I integron genese 02 ( 0 – 10)\nICE-associated genesf 5 127 (4 – 192)\nPredicted phage genesg 18 124 (19 – 271)\naCore genome defined as that sequence present in≥90% of the twelve\nreference genomes, using PA14 as the primary reference sequence and PAO1\nas the secondary reference.\nbNumber of annotated coding sequences.\ncPercentage of coding sequences sharing at least 1 base with a neighboring\ncoding sequence.\ndCoding sequences with homology to proteins labeled as transposases or\ninactivated derivatives in COG database.\neGenes flanked bysul1 and intI1 homologs inclusive of these two genes.\nfGenes with homologs in ICEberg protein database.\ngGenes contained within intact, questionable, and incomplete prophage\nregions predicted by PHAST.\nFigure 4Sizes of accessory genomic regions.The size\ndistribution of all accessory genomic elements identified among\nthe twelve reference genomes are plotted.

These results confirmed that sequences\nassociated with mobile elements were concentrated in the\naccessory genome ofP. aeruginosa and further validated\nour method of separating core and accessory genomes.\nCoding sequences belonging to the core and accessory\ngenomes were assigned to put ative super-functional\n(Figure 5A) and functional (Figure 5B) categories using\nthe Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG)\ndatabase [46,47]. Approximately one-third of the pre-\ndicted genes in the core genome were dedicated to\nmetabolic functions. One-third was roughly evenly split\nbetween cellular process/signaling functions and infor-\nmation storage/processing functions. Functions of those\npredicted genes in the remaining third of the core gen-\nome were either poorly categorized or uncategorized. In\nthe accessory genomes of the reference P. aeruginosa\nstrains, on the other hand, more than two-thirds of the\naccessory genes fell into the categories of poorly charac-\nterized or uncharacterized functions, and almost half had\nno identifiable ortholog in the COG database (Figure 5B).\nWe next examined the architecture of the pangenome\nof the twelve reference P. aeruginosa genomes and the\nrelative locations of the core and accessory genomic ele-\nments. As has been shown previously [12], accessory ele-\nments were more concentrated in some regions of the\nchromosome than others (Figure 6). However, the overall\ndistribution of accessory elements was actually quite broad.\nThe core genome derived from the twelveP. aeruginosa\nreference strains consisted of 884 segments 10 bp or lar-\nger and was interrupted on average every 6.6 kb by an\naccessory element (data not shown). The largest un-\ninterrupted stretch of core genome consisted of 82 kb of\nsequence (data not shown).\nA method for rapidly identifying accessory genomic\nelements in newly-sequencedP. aeruginosa strains\nThe theoretically open genome ofP. aeruginosa implies\nthat novel accessory genomic elements are likely to be\npresent in each newly sequenced strain. As additional\nstrains ofP. aeruginosa are sequenced, a method for rap-\nidly identifying their AGEs will be necessary. Here we\ndescribe AGEnt, an algorithm developed for this purpose\n(Figure 1). AGEnt computationally subtracts previously\nderived core genome sequences from a query draft or\ncomplete genome sequence to yield the accessory genome.\nThe program has two inputs: 1) the sequence of a query\ngenome as contigs, scaffolds, or completed chromosome(s)\nand 2) a core genome sequence. It outputs sequences\nthat belong to the accessory genome of the query\nstrain [48].\nTo test the fidelity of this approach, we applied it to\neach of the twelve reference strains and compared its re-\nsults to the accessory genome sequences previously\nFigure 5Functional annotations of core and accessory genes.

Only pre-\ndicted elements with a minimum length of 10 bases\nwere included. Comparison of accessory element se-\nquences in each genome identified by AGEnt with those\nidentified in the preceding analysis (“non-core”) showed\nthat in all cases agreement was good (Additional file 1:\nTable S1). Nearly all (99.06%) of the non-core sequence\nwas also identified by AGEnt. The amount of genomic\nsequence identified by AGEnt that was not found in the\nnon-core sequence set was also very low, ranging be-\ntween 0.01% and 0.30% (average 0.20%) of the total\namount of AGE sequence identified. The taxonomic out-\nlier PA7 showed the most discrepancy between the AGEnt\noutput and previously identified non-core sequence. Thus\nthe AGEnt algorithm accurately identifies accessory gen-\nomic sequences.\nTo further evaluate its performance, AGEnt was com-\npared to other algorithms for identifying accessory gen-\nome. These included the following: 1) IslandViewer [42], a\nweb-based application that combines three algorithms\nfor identifying potential genomic islands in bacterial\nsequences using whole-genome alignments with reference\nstrains, sequence composition, codon usage characteris-\ntics, and homology with known mobility genes, and 2) the\nPan-Genome Analysis module of Panseq [36], which uses\nBLASTn and NUCmer to evaluate for presence or ab-\nsence of genomic segments among a set of user-provided\nbacterial genome sequences. The AGEnt algorithm identi-\nfied substantially more coding sequences in each reference\nP. aeruginosa strain as accessory than did IslandViewer\n(Figure 7A). The amount of sequence identified as\naccessory by both of these methods was relatively\nsmall. In contrast, most of the sequences identified as\naccessory elements by Panseq were also identified as\naccessory by AGEnt (Figure 7A). Panseq did, however, also\nidentify a large amount of sequence as accessory that was\nnot identified as such by AGEnt.\nAnother method to identify accessory genome sequences\nrelies upon genomic context. Mathee and colleagues com-\npared five sequencedP. aeruginosastrains to identify clus-\nters of genes not shared among all five genomes [12].\nThe authors identified 52 such regions they designated\nFigure 6Pangenome and core genome of twelve strains ofP. aeruginosa.

As more genome sequences\nbecame available, further P. aeruginosa RGPs were de-\nscribed [44,49-51]. Comparison of genes contained within\nRGP borders against coding sequences in the accessory\ngenome identified by AGEnt revealed that an average of\n39% of genes in accessory sequence called by AGEnt were\nnot contained within described RGP borders (Figure 7A).\nTo further evaluate the accuracy of AGEnt relative to\nthe other methods of identifying accessory genome, we\nused homology searches to designate genes (rather than\nsequences) as core or accessory. All annotated coding se-\nquences in each strain were screened to determine\nwhether homologs of each gene were present in the other\nreference strains. A minimum of 50% sequence identity\nacross at least 50% of the gene length was defined as a\ngene homolog. For the purposes of analysis, genes found\nto have homologs in≥90% (11 or 12) of the 12 reference\nstrains were considered to be core genes, and genes found\nto have homologs in <90% (≤10) of the reference strains\nwere considered accessory genes. All genes designated as\naccessory by each of the prediction methods (AGEnt,\nIslandViewer, Panseq, or RGPs) were categorized as core\nor accessory by gene homology in this fashion (Figure 7B).\nAn average of 89.7% of genes predicted to be within the\naccessory genomes of the reference strains by AGEnt were\nalso found to belong within the accessory genomes by\ngene homology, versus 68.5% of accessory genes pre-\ndicted by IslandViewer, 73.1% of genes predicted by\nPanSeq, and 71.6% of genes predicted by RGP analysis\n(p < 0.001 in comparison to AGEnt in all three cases).\nGenes that were not found within the accessory genome\nin each method were also evaluated. Less than 0.1% of\ngenes predicted to be core by AGEnt were not predicted\nto be core by gene homology, versus 6.4% (p < 0.001),\n< 0.1% (p = 0.27), and 3.6% (p < 0.001) of genes identi-\nfied as core by IslandViewer, PanSeq, and RGP analysis,\nrespectively (Figure 7B). When a more conservative\ndefinition of gene homology was used (at least 80%\nsequence identity across at least 80% of the gene\nlength), predicted accessory genes determined to also be\naccessory by gene homology increased to 99.2% for\nAGEnt, but concordance among the other prediction\nmethods remained significantly lower at 72.0%, 82.3%, and\n78.2% for IslandViewer, PanSeq, and RGP analysis, re-\nspectively (p < 0.001 for all three comparisons to AGEnt).\nThese results suggest that AGEnt successfully identifies\ngenomic regions containing genes that are accessory to\nthe P. aeruginosagenome and that few potential accessory\ngenes are being missed by this method.\nIdentification of accessory genomic elements in\nnewly-sequenced P. aeruginosa genomes\nSince most newly sequenced bacterial genomes are re-\nleased as draft (as opposed to finished) sequences, we\nevaluated the utility of AGEnt in the identification of the\naccessory genome from draft sequences. In particular,\nwe applied it to draft sequences of two commonly used\nbut previously unsequenced strains ofP. aeruginosa, PA99\nand PA103. PA99 is a clinical isolate obtained from the\nurine of an adult patient [52]. This strain is characterized\nby secretion of the three type III secreted effectors ExoS,\nExoT, and ExoU [53]. Most strains ofP. aeruginosasecrete\nFigure 7Performance of AGEnt compared to other predictors ofP. aeruginosa accessory genome.AGEnt was compared to IslandViewer,\nPanseq, and RGPs for identification of accessory genome sequences.(A) Colored bars represent the proportion of accessory genome coding\nsequences (CDS) identified by both AGEnt and the comparator method (red), identified by AGEnt but not the comparator method (purple), or\nidentified by the respective comparator method but not AGEnt (green).(B) Evaluation of the accuracy of accessory genome identification by AGEnt\nand the comparator methods using gene homology searches as a gold-standard. Genes were considered homologous if they shared at least 50%\nsequence identity across at least 50% of the gene length.

PA99 has been\nused extensively to study theP. aeruginosa type III secre-\ntion system [54-56]. PA103 was first isolated from the spu-\ntum of a patient [57] and has been frequently used in\nstudies of P. aeruginosa virulence [25,58-60]. Sequencing\nof both strains was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000\nplatform generating 18.30 and 12.65 million paired-end\n100-bp reads for PA99 and PA103, respectively.De novo\nassembly of the draft genome sequences was performed\nusing Ray assembly software [61] and annotation was per-\nformed with the RAST automated annotation server [62].\nAssembly and annotation characteristics of both genomes\nare found in Table 2.\nPA99 and PA103 accessory genomes were identified by\nAGEnt using the core genome derived from the 12 refer-\nence strains of P. aeruginosa. The accessory genome of\nPA99 was 688 kb in size and contained 493 ORFs\n(Table 2). The accessory genome of PA103 was 918 kb in\nsize and contained 732 ORFs (Table 2). Similar to the ref-\nerence strains, the accessory genomes of PA99 and PA103\nwere enriched for transposases, ICE genes, and phage-\nassociated genes, whereas no type I integron genes were\nfound in either PA99 or PA103 (Table 2). The perform-\nance of AGEnt on these draft genomes was compared to\nother methods for determining the accessory genome. As\nwith the reference genomes, a large number of ORFs that\nAGEnt designated as accessory were not also identified as\naccessory by IslandViewer or RGP analysis (Figure 8).\nSimilar to the pattern of Panseq identification of accessory\ngenome in the reference strains, there was a greater overlap\nof ORFs called by both AGEnt and Panseq in PA99 and\nPA103, but several more ORFs identified by Panseq were\nnot also called accessory by AGEnt (Figure 8). To evaluate\nthe accuracy of AGEnt, the ORFs of the accessory ge-\nnomes of PA99 and PA103 were compared to the coding\nsequences of the twelve reference genomes by BLAST\nanalysis. Using the criteria of at least 80% sequence iden-\ntity across at least 80% of the gene length, more than 98%\nof the ORFs in PA99 and more than 99% of the ORFs in\nPA103 identified as accessory by AGEnt were found to\nhave homologs in <90% of the 12 reference strains. By\ncontrast, fewer than 1% of the coding sequences in either\nstrain that were not contained in the identified accessory\nregions had homologs in <90% of the reference strains.\nThese results indicate that AGEnt can effectively distin-\nguish accessory genomic elements from core elements in\ndraft genomes ofP. aeruginosaproduced by NGS.\nDiscussion\nComparative genomic studies have demonstrated that the\naccessory genomes of bacteria play important roles in\nniche adaptation and virulence. It is anticipated that\ncontinued study will result in descriptions of core genomes\nthat are progressively better characterized and defined, but\nTable 2 Genome characteristics ofP. aeruginosa strains\nPA99 and PA103\nPA99 PA103\n# of contigs 142 270\nTotal contig size (bp) 6,343,993 6,716,795\nContig N50 (bp) 92,875 53,587\nAverage contig G + C (%) 66.1 66.1\nPredicted CDSs (#) 5,739 6,103\nAccessory genome size (bp) 688,597 918,208\n% of total contigs size 10.8 13.7\nAverage accessory G + C (%) 59.9% 60.8%\nAccessory ORFs (#) 493 732\nTransposasesa 21\nType I integron genesb 00\nICE-associated genesc 101 216\nPredicted phage genesd 25 69\naCoding sequences with homology to proteins labeled as transposases or\ninactivated derivatives in COG database.\nbGenes flanked bysul1 and intI1 homologs inclusive of these two genes.\ncGenes with homologs in ICEberg protein database.\ndGenes contained within intact, questionable, and incomplete prophage\nregions predicted by PHAST.\nFigure 8Performance of AGEnt in identifying accessory\nsequences in the draft genomes ofP. aeruginosa strains PA99\nand PA103.AGEnt was compared to IslandViewer, Panseq, and\nRGPs for identification of accessory genome sequences.

BMC Genomics2014, 15:737 Page 9 of 17\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/737\nnovel accessory genomic sequences will continue to be\nforthcoming, especially in bacteria such asP. aeruginosa\nwith theoretically open genomes. For this reason,\nmethods for rapidly and accurately identifying accessory\ngenome sequences are needed. To accomplish this, we\ndeveloped a new software algorithm for identification of\nboth core and accessory genomes from bacterial genome\nsequences. First, Spine determines the “core” genome\nfrom a group of genomic sequences. This information\nis then used in conjunction with AGEnt to identify accessory\ngenome in draft genomic sequences. Here we applied this\napproach to the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa.\nComparison to results generated by previously published\nprograms indicated that AGEnt performed well and is\ncapable of accurately identifying accessory genome se-\nquences in draft genomes produced using NGS technology.\nIn our analysis, the P. aeruginosa core genome was\nfound to be 5.84 Mbp in size, containing 5,316 genes.\nThese results are based on a‘soft’ definition of core gen-\nome as consisting of those regions present in≥ 90% of the\nreference strains. Previous studies had found theP. aerugi-\nnosa core genome to contain 4,934– 5,021 genes [12,51]\nrepresenting roughly 86% to 88% of the totalP. aeruginosa\ngenome. These earlier analyses, however, were based on\nfewer genome sequences (4– 5) and used a‘strict’ defin-\nition of core genome, including only genes that were\npresent in 100% of strains. In our analysis, the accessory\ngenome of P. aeruginosa was found to comprise 11% of\nthe total genome size, which compares well to previous\nestimates of approximately 10% [12,63,64]. Therefore, the\naccessory genome ofP. aeruginosa, as a proportion of the\ntotal genome size, is smaller than that of some other\npathogenic bacteria, such asE. coli(20% [65]),Acinetobac-\nter baumannii (12 – 19% [66]), Listeria monocytogenes\n(12 – 23% [67]), andStaphylococcus aureus (25% [68]),\nbut larger than other bacteria with closed pangenomes,\nsuch asBacillus anthracis[69] andFrancisella tularensis[70].\nOur approach to identifying a strain’s accessory genome\noffers several advantages over other methods. By defining\nthe P. aeruginosa core genome based on conserved se-\nquence rather than conserved genes, potential bias intro-\nduced by gene-calling was eliminated and non-coding\nregions were also included in the defined core genome\n[71]. This is advantageous, as non-coding elements such as\nsmall RNAs are increasingly being recognized as important\nin the physiology ofP. aeruginosa [72]. By circumventing\nthe requirement for annotation, this approach allows for\nidentification of accessory genome sequences from newly\nsequenced strains in minutes through a web application\nor on a desktop computer. As NGS whole-genome se-\nquencing technology becomes more widespread, easily ac-\ncessible, and affordable, researchers are able to quickly\ngenerate draft sequences of dozens of bacterial strains in a\nsingle sequencing run. As a result, the number of draft\ngenomes being generated is far outpacing“finished” ge-\nnomes with complete annotations [73]. Because of the\nshorter sequencing reads generated by NGS technologies\nand the corresponding inability to unambiguously resolve\nlonger nucleotide repeat structures within the genome,\nthese draft genomes contain many gaps [74]. The ability\nto easily and accurately identify the accessory genomic se-\nquences from these draft sequences without slow and\ncomputationally demanding cross-comparisons of coding\nsequences to group homologous proteins will become in-\ncreasingly important in comparative genomic studies.\nSuch analyses would be of particular utility in studies of\nthe contribution of accessory elements to phenotypes such\nas virulence, antibiotic resistance, or metabolic diversity.\nGiven that some complex phenotypic characteristics such\nas virulence have been shown to be combinatorial inP. aer-\nuginosa [75], the complete capture of a strain’s accessory\ngenomic content will be of considerable importance to\nfuture studies correlatingP. aeruginosa phenotypes with\nspecific accessory genomic elements.\nCompared to other currently available applications,\nSpine/AGEnt shows improved accuracy and flexibility.\nIn the case of IslandViewer, some reasons for the discrep-\nancies observed may include IslandViewer’s potential to\nmiss smaller accessory regions since islands smaller than\n3 kb are not included in the results, and only a limited\nnumber of reference genomes for comparison are avail-\nable in the site’s online database. In addition, the Island-\nPick application in IslandViewer excludes as GIs regions\nthat are found in any of the comparator reference ge-\nnomes. Thus this method is best suited for identifying\nnovel accessory sequences that are unique to the query\nstrain and have not been previously observed in the refer-\nence strains. Finally, as some of the IslandViewer methods\nrely on identifying typical architectural characteristics of\nGIs to call accessory regions, the input of randomly scaf-\nfolded contigs from the draft assemblies of PA99 and\nPA103 could conceivably have resulted in reduced sensi-\ntivity for identifying accessory elements.\nThere are more similarities between the approaches\ntaken by Panseq and Spine/AGEnt. Like AGEnt, Panseq\ndoes not require the input sequences to be either\ncomplete or annotated. The software, however, is not\nas directed at defining core or accessory sequences or\ngenomic coordinates from input genomes and therefore\nsome post-hoc manipulation of the standard Panseq out-\nput was necessary for comparison to AGEnt. The standard\noutput by the web version of Panseq provides the align-\nment coordinates of each of the reference genomes against\nthe pangenome sequence rather than against the input se-\nquences. To allow direct comparison of the performance\nof Panseq to AGEnt, the additional step of converting\nthese pangenome alignment coordinates to accessory\ncoordinates (i.e. the coordinates of regions in each strain\nOzer et al. BMC Genomics2014, 15:737 Page 10 of 17\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/737\naligning to <90% of the reference strains) was necessary\n(see Methods). The Panseq analysis results were also\ndependent upon the values used for several adjustable\nparameters. For our comparison, we used the web version\nof Panseq’s default settings: 500 bp minimum novel region\nsize, 500 bp fragmentation size, and 90% sequence identity\ncutoff. It is conceivable that Panseq could perform\ncomparatively better against Spine/AGEnt with different\nparameter settings. However, using settings of 50 bp mini-\nmum novel region size, 50 bp fragmentation size, and 85%\nsequence identity cutoff, we found even more core gen-\nome sequence was misidentified as“accessory” by Panseq\n(data not shown).\nAs described above, regions of genomic plasticity\n(RGPs) represent locations in theP. aeruginosa genome\nwhere accessory elements are likely to be found, but our\nresults suggest that examining only these sites in a given\nstrain may miss almost half of accessory genomic se-\nquences. Relying on defined insertion“hotspots” in theP.\naeruginosa genomes suffers from the limitation that novel\ninsertion sites may only become apparent as more se-\nquences are examined [76]. Thus it is anticipated that the\naccuracy of this approach will improve as more genome\nsequences become available. It is also apparent from our\nresults that a non-trivial percentage of coding sequences\nwithin RGPs do not belong to the accessory genome\n(Figure 7B). This may be explained by RGPs having been\ndefined from a smaller group of reference genomes and\nabsence or deviation in content from even one of the\ngenomes was sufficient to warrant definition as an RGP.\nAnother explanation for this finding may be that certain\ngenes are found between different RGP anchors in differ-\nent strains, yet are present in most or allP. aeruginosa\nstrains. The RGP approach would define such genes as\naccessory. In contrast, AGEnt, which does not take loca-\ntion of genes in the genome into account when defining\naccessory versus core would label these genes as core. This\nminimizes false calls in cases of genome rearrangements\nor mosaic accessory elements.\nOur analysis and comparison of Spine/AGEnt to other\nbioinformatic tools was not exhaustive. Other than the\nP. aeruginosa-specific RGP method, we tried to choose\nfunctional web-based applications representative of both\ncomparative genomic and sequence-based approaches to\naccessory genome identification. We did not evaluate\nsome other applications available for identifying accessory\nsequences in bacterial genomes that made use of similar\napproaches. Examples include, but are not limited to,\nMobilomeFINDER [77], Mosaic [78,79], mGenomeSubtractor\n[80], PIPS [81], and Alien_hunter [40].\nThe Spine/AGEnt approach to identifying accessory\ngenomic elements inP. aeruginosahas certain limitations.\nWhole-genome alignment of reference genomes and core\ngenome identification with Spine can be time-consuming\nwith standard computer resources. We have tried to\nminimize this bottleneck by designing Spine to run ana-\nlyses in parallel processes when computing hardware al-\nlows. However, once the step of core genome definition by\nSpine has been performed, subsequent backbone subtrac-\ntion with AGEnt is a much more rapid process, requiring\nseconds or minutes to complete. A second limitation is\nthat only 12 genomes were used to define theP. aerugi-\nnosa core genome. As moreP. aeruginosa genomes are\nsequenced and finished, updating of the core genome\ndefinition by adding these new genomes to the whole-\ngenome alignment will undoubtedly reassign some se-\nquences currently defined as core to the accessory genome\nand vice versa. For this reason, we have designed both\nSpine and AGEnt with the flexibility to accept any user-\ndefined set of genome sequences. This will allow for easy\nupdating of the core sequence definition as more com-\npleted genomes become available.\nWe defined the core genome as sequences present\nin ≥90% (at least 11 of 12) of reference genomes. We\nchose this less restrictive definition rather than requir-\ning that core sequences be present in all members of\nthe species [69] for several reasons. Although such a\nset of “core” genes may contain genes that are absent\nin a few members of the species, it will nonetheless\ncapture genes that define the vast majority of strains\nin the species and might reasonably be considered typ-\nical of the species. This approach prevents a few out-\nlier strains from dramatically biasing the set of core\ngenes characteristic of a bacterial species. For example, the\nmajor exotoxin genetoxA and the quorum sensing regula-\ntor mvfR are commonly found inP. aeruginosastrains but\nare missing from strain PA7 [44]. A strict definition ofP.\naeruginosa core genome would exclude these genes from\nthe core genome ofP. aeruginosa despite their near ubi-\nquitous presence and prominent role in defining the char-\nacteristics of the species. The 90% threshold also makes\nthe core genome less sensitive to future reclassification of\na minor subset of strains to different species. It has been\nproposed that as more genome sequences become avail-\nable, bacterial species classification will become more de-\nfined by genome characteristics and less by DNA-DNA\nhybridization patterns [82]. If this is indeed the case,\nstrains such as PA7 may one day be excluded from theP.\naeruginosa species. These concerns are not unique toP.\naeruginosa but have also been observed in other species\n[83]. For this reason, we feel a less restrictive definition of\nthe P. aeruginosa core genome, as used in this study, has\nbetter utility in defining the core genome of a bacterial\nspecies. As the number of strains used to define core gen-\nome increases with future sequencing projects, a more\nrigorous definition of core (i.e. present in≥ 95% of strains)\nmay provide a better balance between over- and underesti-\nmating the true species core genome.\nOzer et al. BMC Genomics2014, 15:737 Page 11 of 17\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/737\nA limitation of comparative genomics approaches to\ncore/accessory definition, including Spine/AGEnt, is that\nthe selection of reference sequence(s) for comparison\ncan bias the output. In this study, for example, eleven of\nthe twelve finished P. aeruginosa genomes available to\nserve as reference genomes were clinical isolates ob-\ntained from infections, Therefore it is conceivable that\nsome genomic regions determined to be“core” by this\nanalysis may be common to clinical strains but not rep-\nresented in environmental strains. The identification of a\nmore generally species-specific core genomes will likely\nbe facilitated by inclusion of a greater number of gen-\nomic sequences from a diversity of sources as they be-\ncome available. Additionally, combination of the results\nof Spine/AGEnt with a sequence-based approach to identi-\nfying horizontally transferred genetic elements, such as\nAlien_hunter [40], SIGI-HMM [38], or IslandPath-DIMOB\n[39], could also potentially increase accessory element de-\ntection sensitivity through examination of sequence com-\nposition characteristics and/or mobility gene locations\nthat would be independent of any comparator reference\ngenome(s).\nDefinition of a representative species core genome se-\nquence could assist in assigning newly sequenced strains\nto a species. Bacterial species definitions have been sub-\nject to debate [82] and several definitions have been in-\ntroduced. For example, Stackebrandt & Goebel proposed\nthat two strains belong to a species if they share 97% or\nmore sequence similarity in their 16S rRNA genes [84].\nOthers have proposed that average nucleotide identity\n(ANI) of less than 95% in the alignment of two whole-\ngenome sequences can be used to differentiate species\n[85,86]. Previous reports have suggested a role for using\ncore genome contents to define taxonomic boundaries\n[87,88]. Core genome gene alignments were used to show\nthat Azobacter vinelandii clusters closely with other\nPseudomonas species, suggesting it may belong to the\nPseudomonas genus [89]. Core genome sequence ana-\nlyses were used in other recent genomic studies of P.\naeruginosa to define strain relatedness [90,91]. A spe-\ncies majority core genome, such as that identified by\nSpine, could serve as a basis for assigning newly se-\nquenced strains to species. Similar to an ANI calcula-\ntion between two strains, a strain could be assigned to\na species based on the total amount of the core gen-\nome it contained and a threshold for the amount of\ncore genome in common could be established, below\nwhich a strain would be considered to belong to a dif-\nferent species. Further analyses and genome compari-\nsons would be required to evaluate the feasibility of\nsuch an approach to taxonomic designation.\nAlthough this report focuses on characteristics of the\nP. aeruginosa core and accessory genomes, the methods\ndescribed can be generalized to other prokaryotes. As\nlong as multiple complete, finished genomes of the organ-\nism of interest are available, it will be possible to define a\ncore genome and to apply it to derive accessory genomic\nsequence from query genomes using these tools. Indeed,\nSpine also allows inclusion of incomplete or draft ge-\nnomes when generating the core genome sequence al-\nthough at the possible expense of some specificity in\nidentifying the accessory genome. Further studies using\nSpine and AGEnt to identify the accessory genomes of\nother bacterial species are ongoing.\nConclusions\nWe have developed new software tools, Spine and AGEnt,\nto identify core and accessory genome from nucleotide se-\nquences of finished or draft genomic sequences. We have\nused this software to determine aP. aeruginosa core gen-\nome from the sequences of twelve reference genomic se-\nquences and used this to define the accessory genome of\ntwo newly sequenced strains, PA99 and PA103. Spine and\nAGEnt compared favorably to other methods for differen-\ntiating core and accessory genome inP. aeruginosa. This\nstudy increases our understanding of the composition and\ncharacteristics of theP. aeruginosagenome as well as pro-\nvides new tools for studying the variable component of\nbacterial genomes.\nMethods\nReference strains, mobile element prediction, and\nwhole-genome sequencing\nT h ea n n o t a t e dc o m p l e t eg e n o m es e q u e n c e so fP. aeruginosa\nstrains B136-33 (CP004061.1), DK2 (CP003149.1), LESB58\n(FM209186.1), M18 (CP002496.1), NCGM2.S1 (AP012280.1),\nPA7 (CP000744.1), UCBPP-PA14 (CP000438.1), PACS2\n(NZ_AAQW01000001.1), PAO1 (AE004091.2), and RP73\n(CP006245.1) were obtained from NCBI GenBank. The\nnucleotide sequences of 19BR (AFXJ01000001.1) and\n213BR (AFXK01000001.1), which were not yet annotated\nin GenBank, were downloaded and automated annotation\nperformed using the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems\nTechnology (RAST) web service [62]. Functional annota-\ntion of genes and transposase identification was accom-\nplished by BLASTp alignment of annotated ORFs against\nthe COG database [46,47] using BLAST + v2.2.24 [92,93].\nProphage sequence was predicted in the reference strains\nusing the web-based service PHAST [94], which detects\nprophage sequences in bacterial genomes using database\ncomparisons and feature identifications. ICE genes were\nidentified by BLAST homology to proteins in the ICEberg\ndatabase [95] using homology cutoffs of Evalue≤1e-6 and\npercent identity ≥ 85%. To identify integron sequences,\nthe type 1 integron flanking sequences ofsul1 and intI1\nfrom NCGM2.S1 were obtained from thePseudomonas\nGenome Database [96]. Nucleotide BLAST alignment of\nOzer et al. BMC Genomics2014, 15:737 Page 12 of 17\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/737\nthese sequences against the reference genomic sequences\nwas used to identify potential type 1 integron structures.\nGenomic sequencing of theP. aeruginosastrains PA103\nand PA99 was performed on the Illumina Hi-Seq 2000\nplatform by the Genomics Resource Center at the Univer-\nsity of Maryland School of Medicine Institute for Genome\nSciences with 100 bp paired-end reads yielding at least\n100-fold average read coverage across each strain. The\nreads were de novo assembled using Ray v2.0.0-rc5 [61]\nand resulting contigs annotated using RAST. Open read-\ning frames smaller than 50 amino acids were discarded\nand annotations manually edited as needed. The Whole\nGenome Shotgun projects have been deposited at DDBJ/\nEMBL/GenBank under the accessions JARJ00000000\n(PA99) and JARI00000000 (PA103). The versions de-\nscribed in this paper are versions JARJ01000000 (PA99)\nand JARI01000000 (PA103).\nCore genome identification\nFor the purposes of this study, the core genome was de-\nfined as those sequences present in nearly all genomes\nfrom bacteria of a given species. Spine, a program wrapper\nwritten in Perl was developed to identify core genome\nfrom genomic DNA sequences (Figure 1). The software is\navailable as a web-based application or for download as a\ncommand-line script [48]. Spine identifies core genome\nsequences by first performing genome alignments of user-\nsupplied reference strain sequences using the NUCmer\nfunction of the MUMmer software package v3.23 [97,98].\nAn all-vs.-all alignment of the reference strains is per-\nformed using the “--maxmatch” option to preserve all\nunique and non-unique matches. Otherwise default\nNUCmer parameters are used. The resulting alignment\nfile is converted to alignment coordinates and sorted by\nreference ID using MUMmer’s “show-coords” function.\nSpine then outputs DNA sequence and genomic coordi-\nnates of regions present in a user-defined subset of the ref-\nerence genomes using the NUCmer alignment coordinate\nfile and the sequences of the reference genomes. For this\nstudy of twelve P. aeruginosa reference genomes, only\nalignments with at least 85% sequence identity were con-\nsidered homologous. Note that this analysis allows for and\nincludes as core those conserved sequences that are dupli-\ncated or repeated in certain strains. Spine also outputs\naccessory genome sequences and their genomic coordi-\nnates (see below). An individual annotatedP. aeruginosa\ngene was categorized as core if≥ 50% of the nucleotide se-\nquence of that gene was contained within the core coord-\ninate set or as accessory if > 50% of the gene sequence was\ncontained within the accessory coordinate set. For the\ncore genome description, sequence and gene definitions\nfrom the annotated PA14 genome were used primarily, i.e.\ngenomic sequence regions in PA14 found to have homolo-\ngous regions in at least 10 of the other reference strains\nand the annotated genes in those PA14 regions were used\nto define most of the core sequence. PAO1 genomic se-\nquence was used for core regions found in 10 of the refer-\nence genomes, but not PA14.\nThe alignments generated by Spine were also used to\nestimate nucleotide core genome and pangenome size\nbased on an adaptation of a method described by Tettelin\net al. [32]. Briefly, all possible combinations of sequential\ninclusion of up to twelve reference strains were evaluated\nto determine the impact on the amount of conserved se-\nquence present in the included genomes (“core genome”)\nand the amount of unique sequence among the included\ngenome sequences (“pangenome”). Locations of core and\naccessory genomic regions in theP. aeruginosa pangen-\nome were plotted using the program CGView [99].\nAccessory genome prediction\nFor the purposes of this study, the accessory genome\nwas defined as those sequences found in someP. aerugi-\nnosa strains but not others (i.e. all sequences not part of\nthe core genome). Accessory genome prediction in bac-\nterial genomic sequences was performed using the algo-\nrithm AGEnt, which relies on a combination of the\nNUCmer function of the MUMmer software package\nv3.23 [97,98] and our Perl script nucmer_difference.pl\n(Figure 1). Briefly, NUCmer is used to create an alignment\nof the query genome against the core genome sequences\ngenerated as described above. The resulting“delta” align-\nment file is used as input for nucmer_difference.pl, which\nidentifies the genomic coordinates of regions not aligning\nto the core genome. The nucmer_difference.pl script then\nproduces a table of coordinates of non-core regions in the\nquery genome and the nucleotide sequences of these re-\ngions. If provided with a list of gene coordinates, nuc-\nmer_difference.pl will also output the genes within these\nregions that are part of the accessory genome. AGEnt is\nimplemented in Perl and is available as both a web-based\napplication and for download [48]. Output parameters are\ncustomizable, but for these analyses, an individual gene\nwas considered to belong to the accessory genome if≥\n50% of its sequence was contained within the coordinates\nof an accessory region.\nGenomic islands in the genomic sequences were pre-\ndicted using the IslandViewer web service [42]. The“pan-\ngenomic sequence analysis” function of PanSeq [36,37]\nwas run on the twelve reference genomes using default\nparameters except that “coreGenomeThreshold” was set\nat 11. To allow the results of the Panseq analysis to be dir-\nectly compared to AGEnt results, the“pan_genome.txt”\noutput file was used to determine coordinates of all\nreference sequences present in less than eleven of the\ntwelve input strains. P. aeruginosa regions of genomic\nplasticity (RGPs) were identified in the reference strains\nbased on nucleotide BLAST homologies to flanking coding\nOzer et al. BMC Genomics2014, 15:737 Page 13 of 17\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/15/737\nsequences of those RGPs summarized by Klockengether\net al. [51]. Only RGPs containing at least one and no more\nthan two hundred coding sequences in a particular strain\nwere included in the analysis. For IslandViewer, accessory\nregions were predicted in unfinished, draft genomes by first\nconcatenating scaffolds, separating each scaffold with a\nstring of 20 ambiguous bases. Accessory regions of draft\ngenomes were predicted in Panseq by first producing a\ncore genome sequence consisting of regions present in\nat least eleven of twelve reference genomes from the\n“pan_genome.txt” output file, as above. This core genome\nsequence was then uploaded as“reference” and the draft\ngenome sequence as“query” in the“Novel Region Finder”\nmodule on the Panseq site. For RGP analysis of draft\ngenomes, only RGPs with anchors on the same scaffold\nwere included as accessory genome.\nTo compare the performance of the AGEnt algorithm\nto conventional definitions of core and accessory genomes\nthat rely on the presence or absence of discrete genes (as\nopposed to sequences), classification of individual coding\nsequences as being present or absent in each genome was\ndetermined by gene sequence homology as previously\ndescribed by Kittichotirat et al. [34]. Briefly, coding se-\nquences in each query genome were compared to the\ntwelve reference genomes by four separate alignments: i)\ncomparison of the DNA sequence of the query gene to all\ngene sequences in the reference genomes; ii) comparison\nof the DNA sequence of the query gene to the genomic\nDNA sequences of the reference genomes; iii) comparison\nof the protein sequence of the query gene to all protein se-\nquences in the reference genomes; and iv) comparison of\nthe query protein sequence of the query gene to all trans-\nlated proteins from the genomic DNA sequences of the\nreference strains. BLASTn was used to produce align-\nments in steps i and ii. tBLASTn was used to produce\nalignments in step iv. The ublast function of usearch\nv6.0.307 [100] was used in step iii for improved speed over\nBLASTp. To allow sufficient specificity for identifying\ngenes belonging to the accessory genome, alignment hits\nwith at least 50% sequence identity and at least 50%\nsequence coverage between query and hit sequences in\none or more of the analysis steps were considered\nhomologous. If a homolog to a particular gene was found\nin at least eleven of the twelve reference genomes, it was\nconsidered a “core” gene, whereas genes with potential\nhomologs in less than eleven of the twelve reference\ngenomes were classified as “accessory” genes. Statistical\nanalysis of the means was performed using the Student’s\nt-test.\nAvailability of supporting data\nThe software developed for this study can be found\nfor online use (Spine, AGEnt) or download at\nhttp://vfsmspineagent. fsm.northwestern.edu.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.Prediction of accessory elements in\nreference P. aeruginosa genomes using AGEnt and comparison to regions\nexcluded from core genome generation in each reference strain.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nEAO designed and created the software applications, performed sequence\nalignments and analyses, assembled NGS sequencing reads and drafted the\nmanuscript.
