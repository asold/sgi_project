Codes and\ndata are available at https://github.com/Waste-\nWood/FORD.\n1 Introduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT re-\ncently demonstrate general intelligence (Bubeck\net al., 2023) and have been widely used as a foun-\ndation model in various applications (Wei et al.,\n2022b; Wu et al., 2023). To solve complex tasks,\nmultiple LLMs are further introduced to collab-\norate, with each targeting a different subtask or\naspect (Schick et al., 2022; Park et al., 2023). Inter-\nestingly, do these LLMs possess a spirit of collabo-\nration? Are they capable of cooperating effectively\nand performantly towards a shared goal?\nIn this paper, we dive into the inter-consistency\namong LLMs, complementary to existing work\n†Corresponding Authors\nQuestion: The ship wrecked.

Based on the observations, we highlight two\nmain inter-consistent concerns for LLMs’ collab-\noration. First, the viewpoints of LLMs are easily\nshifted. As shown in Figure 1 (a), the proponent\nand opponent LLMs are showing different predic-\ntions, while the proponent quickly compromises\nwith the answer of the opponent. To which extent\ndo LLMs easily change their viewpoints, or adhere\nto their perspectives? Second, when some LLMs\nremain steadfast in Figure 1 (b), can a consensus\nultimately be achieved for the shared goal?\nInspired by the debate theory (Mayer, 1997),\nwe devise a Formal Debate framework (FORD)\nto systematically and quantitatively investigate the\ninter-inconsistency issue in LLMs collaboration.\nBased on FORD, we allow LLMs to explore the\ndifferences between their own understandings and\nthe conceptualizations of others via debate (Mayer,\n1997). Thus, the results can not only shed light to\nencourage more diverse results, but also make it\npossible for performance gains by mutual learning.\nIn specific, we take multi-choice commonsense\nreasoning as the example task as it can accurately\nquantify the inter-inconsistency of LLMs collab-\noration. Then we formulate a three-stage debate\nto align with real-world scenarios: (1) Fair de-\n7572\nbate between two LLMs with comparable capa-\nbilities. (2) Mismatched debate between two\nLLMs who exhibit vastly different levels of abili-\nties. (3) Roundtable debate including more than\ntwo LLMs for debates. Besides, due to the leading\nperformance of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), we con-\nduct an in-depth analysis to adopt GPT-4 as a more\npowerful judge to summarize the debates and offer\nfinal conclusions. Note that FORD is flexible if\nstronger or more LLMs emerge.\nWe summarize our main findings as follows.\n(1) Different types of LLMs (e.g., chat and text\ncompletion models) have large inter-inconsistency,\neven if they are developed from the same base\nmodel. (2) For different versions of an LLM within\nthe same series (e.g., GPT-3.5), although their over-\nall performance keeps improving, the more ad-\nvanced models do not completely supersede the\ncapabilities of the early ones. (3) Through FORD,\nmultiple LLMs hold the potential to collaborate\nand reach a consensus, while the final results are\nnot always so desirable. (4) For LLMs with com-\nparable abilities, they can effectively and perfor-\nmantly achieve a shared goal. (5) On the other hand,\nfor LLMs with mismatched abilities, the superior\nLLMs are more likely to insist on their perspec-\ntives and dominate the debate, while weaker ones\nare more likely to compromise and change their\nviewpoints. (6) Nevertheless, the stubborn and less\ncapable LLMs may distract the superior ones and\nlower the overall performance.\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\n• We systematically and quantitatively study the\ninter-consistency among two and more LLMs.\n• We adopt debate theory and design a formal\ndebate framework FORD towards quantitative\nanalysis and LLMs collaboration.\n• We design a three-stage debate and have con-\nducted extensive experiments to offer insights\nfor future research.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe first describe the datasets and LLMs used in\nthis paper. Then we define a metric INCON to quan-\ntify the inter-inconsistency among multiple LLMs.\nFinally, we define the baselines to verify our pro-\nposed formal debate framework FORD.\nDataset Task Type Size\nαNLI (Bhagavatula et al., 2019) 2 Choices 1,507\nCSQA (Talmor et al., 2019) 5 Choices 1,221\nCOPA (Gordon et al., 2012) 2 Choices 500\ne-CARE (Du et al., 2022a) 2 Choices 2,122\nSocial IQa (Sap et al., 2019) 3 Choices 1,935\nPIQA (Bisk et al., 2020) 2 Choices 1,838\nStrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) Yes or No 2,290\nTable 1: Commonsense reasoning dataset statistics.\n2.1 Commonsense Reasoning Datasets\nFor better coverage, we choose 7 multi-choice com-\nmonsense reasoning datasets for experiments: one\nabductive reasoning dataset αNLI (Bhagavatula\net al., 2019), one commonsense question answer-\ning dataset CSQA (Talmor et al., 2019), two causal\nreasoning datasets COPA (Gordon et al., 2012) and\ne-CARE (Du et al., 2022a), one social interaction\nreasoning dataset Social IQa (Sap et al., 2019),\none physical interaction question answering dataset\nPIQA (Bisk et al., 2020), and one implicit reason-\ning strategy dataset StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021).\nTable 1 shows the statistics of the above datasets.\n2.2 Large Language Models\nWe choose 6 LLMs from multiple sources for ex-\nperiments. We first choose 4 LLMs from OpenAI:\nthree chat completion LLMs gpt-3.5-turbo (de-\nnoted as ChatGPT), gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 (de-\nnoted as ChatGPT-0301), and gpt-4 (denoted\nas GPT-4), as well as one text completion\nLLM text-davinci-003 (denoted as Davinci-\n003). Then we adopt two open-source 13B LLMs:\nan efficient foundation LLM LLaMA (Touvron\net al., 2023), and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\nwhich is trained on 70K data from ShareGPT.\n2.3 Definitions: INCON\nHere we define the metric INCON to quantify the\ninter-inconsistency among multiple LLMs. Specifi-\ncally, suppose there are nLLMs L= {l1,··· ,ln},\nand a dataset with msamples X = {x1,··· ,xm}.\nWe define pi\nj as the prediction of li on xj. Then the\nINCON of Lon X can be defined as:\nINCON =\nm∑\nk=1\nΦ(p1\nk,· · · ,pn\nk )\nm , (1)\nΦ is a sign function, it will be assigned a value of\n1 if there are any two variables in Φ that are not\nequal, otherwise, Φ takes a value of 0.\n7573\n⚖\nOptions:(A)Ideletethewholedocument.(B)Ihitthebackspace.\nQuestion:Iducked.Whatwasthecause?Options:(A)Thefireworkslaunchedup.(B)Thefrisbeesoaredtome.\nSamples\nStep 1: StanceSelection and ArgumentGeneration\nQuestion: I made a grammatical error.

Step 2: LLMs debate alternately on the inconsistent\nsamples. Step 3: A judge summarizes the whole debate process and gives the final conclusion.\n2.4 Baseline Methods\nWe define three kinds of baselines to verify our\nproposed formal debate framework: (1) Single\nLLM use only one LLM to conduct experiments.\n(2) Collaboration-Soft (Col-S) aligns the loose\nscenario that we randomly trust one of the LLMs\nwhen they are inconsistent, so Col-S averages\nthe accuracy of the LLMs. (3) Collaboration-\nHard (Col-H) aligns the conservative scenario that\nwe only trust consistent prediction, so Col-H pre-\ndicts correctly when all LLMs predict correctly.\n3 FORD: Formal Debate Framework\nTo further explore the inter-inconsistency, inspired\nby the structure of debate (Bell, 1998), we design\na formal debate framework (FORD) for LLMs col-\nlaboration to solve shared tasks. In Figure 2, we\nuse two LLMs for illustration, FORD consists of 3\nsteps: (1) Stance selection and argument genera-\ntion expects LLMs to choose a stance and give an\nargument for each sample, aiming to select the in-\nconsistent samples for future collaboration in step 2.\n(2) Alternate debate process makes LLMs alter-\nnately refute each other or seek a compromise to in-\nvestigate whether LLMs can collaborate effectively\ntowards a consensus. (3) Debate summarization\nuses a judge to summarize the debate, then draw a\nfinal conclusion in case does not reach a consensus.\n3.1 Stance Selection & Argument Generation\nThe first step of FORD is to choose a stance, then\nprovide an argument to support the stance. Hence,\nwe ask each LLM to independently choose a choice\nand a short explanation as the stance and argument,\nrespectively. Experimental details and prompts\ncan refer to Appendix A. As shown in step 1 of\nFigure 2, when asked about the cause of “I ducked”,\nthe proponent would hold the stance “ (B)” and\ngives the argument “Frisbee is usually a potential\nthreat to safety” to support its stance.\nWe focus on the inconsistent samples in the sub-\nsequent steps to investigate LLMs collaboration.\n3.2 Alternate Debate Process\nTo investigate whether LLMs can effectively col-\nlaborate and achieve a consensus, we design an\nalternate debate process. Given the arguments in\nstep 1, the proponent conducts round 1 debate to\nfirst counter the opponent by presenting an updated\nargument or to seek a compromise. If no compro-\nmise, the opponent would conduct round 2 to do the\nsame to the proponent by additionally considering\nthe arguments produced in previous rounds. The de-\nbate process will be conducted alternately until the\nLLMs achieve a consensus, or the debate rounds\nreach the maximum number. To make LLMs less\nswing, the stance will not explicitly show in step 2.\nPrompts and details can refer to Appendix B.\nAs shown in step 2 in Figure 2, the proponent\ndefends itself by claiming “deleting is a more direct\nway”, while the opponent adheres to its perspective\nby stating “hitting backspace” is less costly. Finally,\nthe proponent compromise with the opponent.\n7574\nDebate Method αNLI CSQA COPA e-CARE Social IQa PIQA StrategyQA Average\nChatGPT &\nDavinci-003\nChatGPT 77.17 76.17 96.80 81.53 72.71 80.74 69.34 79.21\nDavinci-003 79.96 78.62 95.20 79.69 73.33 76.88 71.48 79.31\nCol-S 78.75 77.40 96.00 80.61 73.02 78.81 70.41 79.29\nCol-H 69.14 68.22 93.80 71.96 62.69 68.55 58.12 70.35\nFORD (Ours) 81.35 78.79 97.00 83.74 74.32 84.60 71.62 81.63\nChatGPT &\nChatGPT-0301\nChatGPT 77.17 76.17 96.80 81.53 72.71 80.74 69.34 79.21\nChatGPT-0301 77.70 75.43 97.20 81.53 73.54 80.79 69.17 79.34\nCol-S 77.44 75.80 97.00 81.53 73.13 80.77 69.26 79.28\nCol-H 74.78 73.46 96.00 79.55 70.96 77.97 67.25 77.14\nFORD (Ours) 78.30 76.41 97.60 81.95 73.75 82.70 69.65 80.05\nLLaMA &\nVicuna\nLLaMA 63.04 66.18 90.20 66.97 58.98 71.60 63.10 68.58\nVicuna 70.60 59.87 89.20 68.05 64.65 60.45 55.28 66.87\nCol-S 66.82 63.02 89.70 67.51 61.82 66.03 59.15 67.72\nCol-H 54.74 47.91 83.40 53.72 46.77 48.26 41.35 53.74\nFORD (Ours) 70.80 66.75 93.80 71.54 63.67 72.25 64.10 71.84\nTable 2: The overall performance of FORD and baselines in the fair debates. Underlined numbers represent the best\nperformance among the collaboration methods on each dataset. Bold numbers denote the best performance among\nall methods on each dataset. “Average” denotes the mean accuracy across different datasets for each method.\n3.3 Debate Summarization\nTo obtain the final result of the debate, we adopt\na judge to summarize the whole debate and draw\na conclusion. We design a template to obtain the\nsummary by filling it with the arguments, which\ncan provide an overview of the debate process to en-\nhance the interpretability. The conclusion is about\nthe result of the debate. For samples that reached a\nconsensus, the conclusion is the consensus stance.\nFor samples without a consensus, we assign equal\nweights to all arguments for the conclusion. Refer\nto Appendix E for more details.\nNext, based on the above framework, we simu-\nlate three debate scenarios for comprehensive inves-\ntigation: (1) Fair debate between two LLMs with\ncomparable capabilities (Sec 4). (2) Mismatched\ndebate between two LLMs with mismatched capa-\nbilities (Sec 5). (3) Roundtable debate including\nmore than two LLMs for debate (Sec 6).\n4 Fair Debate\nGiven multi-choice questions, we conduct fair de-\nbates on three pairs of LLMs: different types of\nLLMs (ChatGPT & Davinci-003 and LLaMA & Vi-\ncuna), and different versions of LLMs (ChatGPT &\nChatGPT-0301). LLMP & LLMO denotes LLMP\nas the proponent, and the LLMO is the opponent.\n4.1 Initial INCON of LLMs Pairs\nWe first conduct step 1 on each LLM on each\ndataset.

The initial INCON of each LLMs pair on each\ndataset is categorized in Figure 3:\n(1) Different types of LLMs hold nearly 20%-\n30% INCON on almost all datasets, even if they are\nbased on the same underlying model. The over-\nlapped part in each bar contributes nearly 50% to\nINCON, which means LLMs in each LLMs pair pos-\nsess comparable yet vastly different capabilities.\n(2) For ChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301, ChatGPT-\n0301 does not supersede ChatGPT in capabilities.\nThis indicates LLMs gain new abilities as they it-\nerate but lose some existing ones. Hence, it is not\nconvincing to use the updated LLMs to reproduce\nthe results of the unavailable early versions.\n4.2 Results of Fair Debate\nThrough steps 2 & 3 in FORD, we intervene the\npredictions under the setting of fair debate. Heuris-\ntically, for ChatGPT & Davinci-003 and LLaMA\n& Vicuna, the maximum rounds of debate is 6.\n7575\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nDebate round\n0\n10\n20INCON (%)\n(a) ChatGPT & Davinci-003\nNLI\nCSQA\nCOPA\ne-CARE\nSocial IQa\nPIQA\nStrategyQA\n0 1 2 3 4\nDebate round\n0\n2\n4\n6INCON (%)\n(b) ChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301\nNLI\nCSQA\nCOPA\ne-CARE\nSocial IQa\nPIQA\nStrategyQA\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nDebate round\n0\n10\n20\n30INCON (%)\n(c) LLaMA & Vicuna\nNLI\nCSQA\nCOPA\ne-CARE\nSocial IQa\nPIQA\nStrategyQA\nFigure 4: The INCON of (a) ChatGPT & Davinci-003, (b)\nChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301, and (c) LLaMA & Vicuna\nacross different debate round. Round 0 denotes the\ninitial INCON (Figure 3) before the debate process.\nWhile for ChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301, the maxi-\nmum rounds of debate is 4.\nTable 2 shows the overall performance of FORD\nand corresponding baselines. We can find that:\n(1) FORD defeats Col-S, Col-H, and corre-\nsponding single LLMs on almost all datasets (ex-\ncept for LLaMA & Vicuna on Social IQa). It is\nbecause FORD can make LLMs obtain more com-\nprehensive and precise perspectives of the question.\nThis signifies that LLMs with comparable abili-\nties possess a spirit of collaboration to effectively\nand performantly achieve a shared goal.\n(2) While FORD on ChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301\ndoes not gain as much improvement as the other\ndebates. Due to their very similar capabilities, they\nusually have similar opinions on each sample, lead-\ning to insignificant improvement.\n(3) On each dataset, ChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301\nhas higher performance floors ( Col-H), this sug-\ngests we choose similar models for conservative\ngains. While ChatGPT & Davinci-003 has higher\nperformance ceilings (FORD), this suggests we\nchoose LLMs with greater variance in capabilities\nto debate for better performance.\nEffect of Debate Rounds: We track the INCON in\neach round of each fair debate on each dataset. The\noverall results are shown in Figure 4. We can find:\nDebate Method e-CARE PIQA\nChatGPT &\nGPT-4\nChatGPT 81.53 80.74\nGPT-4 85.96 95.21\nCol-S 83.75 87.98\nCol-H 77.33 79.00\nFORD 85.96 92.71\nLLaMA &\nChatGPT\nLLaMA 66.97 70.51\nChatGPT 81.53 80.74\nCol-S 74.25 75.63\nCol-H 57.82 61.26\nFORD 74.88 75.84\nTable 3: The overall results of the mismatched debates.\n(1) For each fair debate, the INCON decreases\nprogressively after each round on each dataset.\nIt is because LLMs can learn from differences\namong themselves to reach agreements, demon-\nstrating comparable LLMs can debate to ulti-\nmately achieve a consensus for the shared goal.\n(2) For ChatGPT & Davinci-003 and ChatGPT &\nChatGPT-0301, the INCON drops almost to 0 on all\ndatasets, while LLaMA & Vicuna still has an obvi-\nous inter-inconsistency after debates. We suppose\nthis is attributed to the gap in their capabilities.\n(3) The INCON of ChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301\nachieves coverage after 2 rounds, which is earlier\nthan the other fair debates. This is mainly due\nto their very similar capabilities, causing similar\nopinions to reach a consensus earlier.\n5 Mismatched Debate\nIn human discourse, when interacting with a dom-\ninant individual, we often tend to be influenced\nby their cognition, leading us to adopt their ideas\nand thought processes (Jayagopi et al., 2009). We\ninvestigate this scenario in Mismatched Debate.\nWe adopt two pairs of LLMs in experiments:\nChatGPT & GPT-4 and LLaMA & ChatGPT. For\nefficiency, we select e-CARE and PIQA for analy-\nsis. Experimental details of the mismatched de-\nbates are the same as fair debate ChatGPT &\nDavinci-003. The initial INCON of the mismatched\ndebates can refer to Appendix C.\n5.1 Results of Mismatched Debate\nThe overall results of the mismatched debates are\nshown in Table 3. Figure 5 presents the INCON of\neach debate round. From the results, we can find:\n(1) FORD can easily outperforms Col-S, Col-H,\nand the weaker LLMs, but lose to the stronger\nLLMs. There seems to be a performance ceiling,\n7576\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nDebate round\n0\n10\n20\n30INCON (%)\ne-CARE (ChatGPT & GPT-4)\nPIQA (ChatGPT & GPT-4)\ne-CARE (LLaMA & ChatGPT)\nPIQA (LLaMA & ChatGPT)\nFigure 5: The overall INCON of the mismatched debates\non e-CARE and PIQA across different debate rounds.\nDebate Dataset Proponent Opponent\nChatGPT &\nDavinci-003\ne-CARE 53.69 46.31\nPIQA 53.04 46.96\nChatGPT &\nGPT-4\ne-CARE 7.64 92.36\nPIQA 10.60 89.40\nLLaMA &\nChatGPT\ne-CARE 39.94 60.06\nPIQA 32.08 67.92\nTable 4: The dominance of different LLMs across dif-\nferent debates and datasets.\nwhich is tied to the accuracy of the stronger LLMs.\nLLMs with mismatched abilities struggle to ef-\nfectively collaborate toward a shared goal.\n(2) Even if the capabilities are mismatched, the\nINCON still continues to drop. These demonstrate\nLLMs with mismatched abilities still possess a\nspirit of collaboration to reach a consensus yet\nare disturbed by less capable LLMs.\n(3) Compared with Fair Debates, the dominant\nLLMs (GPT-4 and ChatGPT) may be distracted,\nbut they still bring significant improvements to\nFORD of ChatGPT & Davinci-003 and LLaMA &\nVicuna, respectively.\n(4) FORD of LLaMA & ChatGPT seems to per-\nform far from the ceiling, this is because LLaMA\nis not capable to evaluate the arguments and only\nclaims its stance, which distracts ChatGPT more.\n5.2 The dominance of LLMs\nFor further analysis, we introduce a new met-\nric dominance for LLMs. For example, the\ndominance of the proponent LLM is defined as the\nportion of inter-inconsistent samples that the op-\nponent LLM compromises, and vice versa. The\ndominance directly reflects the extent that the\nLLMs adhere to their viewpoints.\nTake a fair debate (ChatGPT & Davinci-003)\nfor example, Table 4 shows ChatGPT and Davinci-\n003 achieve similar dominance on both datasets.\nIt explains why Comparable LLMs can debate\nto compromise or adhere to more reasonable\nperspectives to improve the performance.Hence,\nLLMs Method e-CARE PIQA\nChatGPT Single LLM 81.53 80.74\nDavinci-003 Single LLM 79.69 76.88\nChatGPT-0301 Single LLM 81.53 80.79\nGPT-4 Single LLM 85.96 95.21\nChatGPT & Davinci-003 FORD (F) 83.74 84.60\nChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301 FORD (F) 81.95 82.60\nChatGPT & GPT-4 FORD (M) 85.96 92.71\nChatGPT &\nDavinci-003 &\nGPT-4\nCol-S (M) 82.39 84.28\nCol-H (M) 69.75 67.57\nFORD (M) 84.78 86.02\nChatGPT &\nDavinci-003 &\nChatGPT-0301\nCol-S (F) 80.92 79.47\nCol-H (F) 70.64 66.38\nFORD (F) 83.79 84.06\nTable 5: The overall performance of roundtable debates.\n(F) denotes fair debate, (M) denotes mismatched debate.\nwe use it as a reference for the mismatched debates,\nas shown in Table 4, we can conclude:\n(1) Stronger LLMs (GPT-4 and ChatGPT) in the\nmismatched debates have absolute advantages in\ndominance. This mirrors human circumstances.\nThus, stronger LLMs hold a larger probability\nto adhere to their perspectives. When superior\nLLMs are less confident in a few samples, they are\neasier to be disturbed by the weaker LLMs.\n(2) However, LLaMA & ChatGPT does not ex-\nhibit such a large gap indominance. This is mainly\nbecause LLaMA is a bad debater. It is not capable\nto evaluate the arguments of others and only gener-\nates the sentence like“Option (x) is more plausible”\nmost of the time, this would make ChatGPT swing.\n6 Roundtable Debate\nIn many scenarios, the debates or discussions of-\nten involve more than two participants, such as\nlaw (Ransom et al., 1993) and healthcare (Chassin\net al., 1998). Since LLaMA and Vicuna are not\ngood at debate, we design two roundtable debates\namong three LLMs: one mismatched debate Chat-\nGPT & Davinci-003 & GPT-4 (denoted as R1),\nand one fair debate ChatGPT & Davinci-003 &\nChatGPT-0301 (denoted as R2).\nFollowing Sec 5, we select e-CARE and PIQA\nfor experiments. In step 1 of FORD, the samples\nthat not all LLMs reach agreements would be sent\nto step 2. For R1 and R2 in step 2, ChatGPT de-\nbates first, Davinci-003 second to align with the fair\ndebates between two LLMs. GPT-4 and ChatGPT-\n0301 speak last in R1 and R2, respectively. The\nLLMs debate up to 9 rounds. Refer to Appendix D\nfor more details and the prompts.\n7577\n0 2 4 6 8\nDebate round\n0\n10\n20\n30INCON (%)\ne-CARE (R1)\nPIQA (R1)\ne-CARE (R2)\nPIQA (R2)\nFigure 6: The overall INCON of the roundtable debates\non e-CARE and PIQA across different debate rounds.\nThe overall results of the roundtable debates are\nshown in Table 5, and Figure 6 shows theINCON of\neach debate round. We can conclude that:\n(1) In both roundtable debates, FORD signifi-\ncantly outperforms Col-S and Col-H. While FORD\nin R1 is much inferior to GPT-4, highlighting a su-\nperior LLM is likely to be more misled and less\ndominant (refer to Table 10 in the Appendix) if\nthere are more weaker LLMs. FORD in R2 outper-\nforms all single LLMs, this proves more than two\ncomparable LLMs can collaborate effectively\nand performantly towards a shared goal.\n(2) The INCON is significantly alleviated, indicat-\ning more than two LLMs still possess the spirit\nto collaborate and achieve a consensus.\n(3) FORD in R1 surpasses FORD in R2. It in-\ndicates adopting a stronger LLM can improve the\nperformance of the debates despite the stronger\nLLM might be misled by the other weaker LLMs.\n(4) In R2, FORD outstrips ChatGPT & ChatGPT-\n0301, while achieving similar results with Chat-\nGPT & Davinci-003, this is because ChatGPT and\nChatGPT-0301 do not possess many distinctions,\nleading to little new information to debates.\n7 Analysis\n7.1 GPT-4 as the Judge\nDifferent arguments in each debate might have dif-\nferent persuasions. Moreover, in human debates,\nthere is a human judge with strong evaluation abil-\nities to summarize the debate and draw the final\nconclusion. Inspired by this, we investigate GPT-4\nas the judge to replace step 3 in FORD and conduct\nexperiments on two fair debates.\nSpecifically, we adopt two fair debates ChatGPT\n& Davinci-003 and ChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301 for\nexperiments. GPT-4 would be prompted to give the\nsummarizations and conclusions only based on the\ndebate process (refer to Appendix F). Table 6 shows\nthe results on ChatGPT & Davinci-003 (Table 8\nin the Appendix presents the results of ChatGPT\nDataset FORD (w/o GPT-4) FORD (w/ GPT-4)\nαNLI 81.35 82.48\nCSQA 78.79 80.10\nCOPA 97.00 97.60\ne-CARE 83.74 83.88\nSocial IQa 74.32 74.57\nPIQA 84.60 85.15\nStrategyQA 71.62 71.70\nAverage 81.63 82.29\nTable 6: The effect of GPT-4 as the judge on the debates\nbetween ChatGPT and Davinci-003.\nDataset LLMs Best Col-S Col-H FORD FORD ∗\ne-CARE 81.53 80.61 71.96 84.74 82.52\nPIQA 80.74 78.81 68.55 84.60 84.44\nTable 7: The results of ablation study on ChatGPT &\nDavinci-003.

It is mainly because GPT-\n4 can assign higher weights to more convincing\narguments, then draw more precise conclusions.\n7.2 The Effect of Debate Order\nLike different initializations may yield different re-\nsults during model training, the debate order in step\n2 might influence the results, we conduct ablation\nstudies to investigate the effect of the debate order.\nSpecifically, we use ChatGPT & Davinci-003\nand ChatGPT & ChatGPT-0301 on e-CARE and\nPIQA for explorations. We will reverse the debate\norder in step 2 of FORD in each debate. The other\nsettings are the same with Sec 4.\nTable 7 and Figure 7 respectively show the re-\nsults and INCON of ChatGPT & Davinci-003 when\nreversing the debate order. Results of ChatGPT &\nChatGPT-0301 can refer to Appendix G. We can\nsummarize the following completions:\n(1) When we exchange Davinci-003 as the pro-\nponent and ChatGPT as the opponent, FORD still\noutperforms Col-S, Col-H, and corresponding sin-\ngle LLMs, yielding similar results to the original\ndebate order. This further supports the earlier find-\nings are not sensitive to the debate order.\n(2) Reversing the debate order of ChatGPT &\nDavinci-003 reduces performance but speeds up\nthe convergence of INCON. It is due to Davinci-003\nbeing a text completion model, initializing debates\n7578\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nDebate round\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20INCON (%)\ne-CARE (Davinci-003 & ChatGPT)\nPIQA (Davinci-003 & ChatGPT)\ne-CARE (ChatGPT & Davinci-003)\nPIQA (ChatGPT & Davinci-003)\nFigure 7: The overall INCON of ChatGPT & Davinci-\n003 with different debate orders on e-CARE and PIQA.\nwith Davinci-003 might mislead the whole debate.\n7.3 Case Study\nTo intuitively investigate how FORD improves the\ninter-consistency and enhances the interpretability,\nwe present an example output by FORD.\nIn Debate 1, the proponent (ChatGPT) holds the\nstance that option (A) is more plausible while the\nopponent (Davinci-003) supposes option (B) is bet-\nter. The proponent pointed out that the key to this\nquestion is the “old yearbook”. The opponent even-\ntually conceded to the proponent. Through this\ndebate, one LLM can supply the aspects that the\nother LLM overlooked, resulting in more convinc-\ning interpretability and accurate decision.\n8 Related Work\n8.1 Reasoning with LLMs\nLLMs have subverted the research paradigm of\nNLP. Using LLMs for reasoning can be catego-\nrized into instruction-tuning-based (IT) and chain-\nof-thought-based (CoT) methods.\nThe IT methods start from FLAN (Wei et al.,\n2022a) and T0 (Sanh et al., 2022). FLAN fine-\ntuned 137B LaMDA-PT (Thoppilan et al., 2022)\nand T0 finetuned T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) on numer-\nous NLP tasks to make LLMs follow instructions,\nthen they achieve impressive performance on un-\nseen tasks. Differently, InstructGPT (Ouyang et al.,\n2022) adopted RLHF to let LLMs learn human\npreferences. Flan-PaLM (Chung et al., 2022) and\nTk-INSTRUCT (Wang et al., 2022c) further scaled\nup LLMs sizes and task size.\nAs for CoT methods, Wei et al. (2022c) proposed\na few-shot CoT to elicit reasoning in LLMs and\nachieve remarkable improvements. Kojima et al.\n(2022) designed zero-shot CoT to get rid of human\nannotations. Then Zhang et al. (2022) proposed\nAutoCoT to automatically generate few-shot CoT\nfor experiments. Wang et al. (2022a) and Fu et al.\n(2023) devised complex CoT for reasoning.\nDebate 1 ChatGPT & Davinci-003 (Judge: GPT-4)\nQuestion: I found my old yearbook today while cleaning.\nWhich event could cause the day was almost over and I\nhadn’t cleaned anything?\nOptions: (A) I became lost in a huge world of fond memories.\n(B) I kept looking through things for more discoveries.\n🤖\n: While going through the yearbook, the person may\nhave become engrossed in looking at old photos and remi-\nniscing about past memories. This could have caused them\nto neglect their cleaning duties, resulting in the day almost\nbeing over without any cleaning being done.\n👾\n: Option (B) suggests that I was looking through things\nwhile I cleaned, which would explain directly why the day\nwas almost over and I hadn’t cleaned anything.\n🤖\n: The scenario of getting lost in fond memories while\nlooking through an old yearbook is a common experience\nthat can cause a person to lose track of time and neglect\ntheir cleaning duties. While option (B) may not be as likely\nas getting caught up in nostalgia.\n👾\n: I think you are right. Getting lost in fond memories\nwhile looking through an old yearbook is a common ex-\nperience that can cause a person to lose track of time and\nneglect their cleaning duties.\n⚖\n: The proponent argues that getting lost in fond mem-\nories (A) is more plausible as it’s a common experience\nthat can cause a person to lose track of time and neglect\ncleaning duties. The opponent initially argues for option\n(B), but eventually agrees with the proponent’s point about\ngetting lost in nostalgia. Therefore, the answer is (A).\nThese methods mainly focused on eliciting rea-\nsoning abilities. While we utilize these methods to\nmake multiple LLMs collaborate for consensuses.\n8.2 Inconsistency in LLMs\nInconsistency is an important issue in existing\nLLMs. Wang et al. (2022b) investigated the self-\nconsistency of LLMs by sampling multiple CoT for\neach example. Jung et al. (2022) proposed to study\nthe logical consistency in LLMs and designed a\nmaieutic prompt to improve the performance on\nyes/no questions. Sahu et al. (2022) devised a con-\nceptual consistency metric to measure the align-\nment between LLMs and the real world. Li et al.\n(2022) proposed a multi-prompt method to obtain\nbetter consistency on each example.\nThese methods investigate inconsistency in a\nsingle LLM, while we complementary investigate\nthe inter-consistency between two or more LLMs.\n9 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we explore inter-inconsistency issues\namong LLMs. Then we propose FORD to examine\nwhether LLMs can effectively collaborate to ulti-\nmately achieve a consensus through debate. With\nFORD, we explore three real-world debate scenar-\n7579\nios: fair debate, mismatched debate, and roundtable\ndebate. We find LLMs possess the spirit of collab-\noration to achieve a consensus for solving a shared\ngoal. Debates can improve the performance and\ninter-consistency of LLMs. Stronger LLMs can\nbe distracted by weaker LLMs when the debates\nare mismatched. These findings contribute to the\nfuture development of collaboration methods.\nLimitations\nThis work still has the following limitations\nwhich can be investigated and improved in the fu-\nture: On the one hand, we should not limit our-\nselves to the commonsense reasoning task and\ncover more tasks, such as mathematical reason-\ning, MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021). On the other\nhand, we should extend the multi-choice task to\nnatural language generation tasks like entailment-\nbank (Dalvi et al., 2021) or complex reasoning\ntasks like causal chain reasoning (Xiong et al.,\n2022) to align the trends of LLMs. Incorporat-\ning more kinds of LLMs and real-world tasks (Du\net al., 2022b; Cai et al., 2023) is also worth further\nexploration. Trading reproducibility for diverse\ndebate behaviors is also a good topic to discuss.\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of the\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China\n(U22B2059, 62176079), the Natural Science Foun-\ndation of Heilongjiang Province (YQ2022F005),\nand the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE)\nAcademic Research Fund (AcRF) Tier 1 grant.\nReferences\nPhilip LaVerne Bell. 1998.

The debate is about choosing a more plausible Option (A or B) to\nanswer the Question below. The opinions of the other two users are not always true, you can ignore any incorrect part of their\nopinion. And you can refer to their opinions to revise your choice or defend your own. Please remember there should and must\nbe a more plausible answer in the choices.\nQuestion: He found out that cytokines worked in it. What was the cause of this? Choices: (A) Tom was studying how body\ntemperature rises. (B) The scientist testing lipoproteins.\nuser2: Colonoscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of the colon and rectum. It is not likely to result in a diagnosis\nof prolapse.\nuser3: The question asks about the result of the colonoscopy check, and option (A) is more plausible as it describes a\npossible reaction to the procedure. Option (B) is not a guaranteed result of a colonoscopy, as the diagnosis could show various\noutcomes.\nuser1: A colonoscopy is a medical procedure that allows a doctor to examine the inside of the colon for any abnormalities or\ndiseases. If the diagnosis showed that the individual had prolapse, it means that there was a displacement of an organ or tissue\nfrom its normal position. This could be a serious condition that requires further medical attention and treatment. It is unlikely\nthat the individual would be terrified of the instrument used for the examination as it is a routine procedure and the doctor\nwould have provided adequate information and reassurance beforehand.\nRemember you are user2.

Which event could cause It worked Choices: (A) Lisa and\nTim went to a fertility clinic to get pregnant. (B) They decided to try the advice given in a book about guitar playing.\nuser1: It is more plausible that Lisa and Tim, who have been married for a long time, would try to improve their skills in a\nhobby they both enjoy, such as playing the guitar, rather than going to a fertility clinic to get pregnant. Improving their guitar\nplaying skills could bring them closer together and strengthen their bond, while trying to conceive a child may not necessarily\nguarantee a successful pregnancy.\nuser2: Option (A) suggests that Lisa and Tim went to a fertility clinic to get pregnant, which could lead to the statement “It\nworked” if they were successful in conceiving a child. Option (B) is about guitar playing and doesn’t relate to the statement\n“It worked”.\nJudge (GPT-4):\n7590"
