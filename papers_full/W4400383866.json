  "abstract": "Abstract Infrared images have important applications in military, security and surveillance fields. However, limited by technical factors, the resolution of infrared images is generally low, which seriously limits the application and development of infrared images in various fields. To address the problem of difficult recovery of edge information and easy ringing effect in the super-resolution reconstruction process of infrared images, an edge-enhanced infrared image super-resolution reconstruction model TESR under transformer is proposed. The main structure of this model is transformer. First, in view of the problem of difficult recovery of edge information of infrared images, an edge detection auxiliary network is designed, which can obtain more accurate edge information from the input low-resolution images and enhance the edge details during image reconstruction; then, the CSWin Transformer is introduced to compute the self-attention of horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel, so as to increase the receptive field of the model and enable it to utilize features with higher semantic levels. The super-resolution reconstruction model proposed in this paper can extract more comprehensive image information, and at the same time, it can obtain more accurate edge information to enhance the texture details of super-resolution images, and achieve better reconstruction results.",
