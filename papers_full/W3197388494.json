  "abstract": "Hackers are increasingly launching phishing attacks via SMS and social media. Games and dating apps introduce yet another attack vector. However, current deep learning-based phishing detection applications are not applicable to mobile devices due to the computational burden. We propose a lightweight phishing detection algorithm that distinguishes phishing from legitimate websites solely from URLs to be used in mobile devices. As a baseline performance, we apply Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to URL-based and HTML-based website features. A model search results in 15 ANN models with accuracies >96%, comparable to state-of-the-art approaches. Next, we test the performance of deep ANNs on URL-based features only; however, all models perform poorly with the highest accuracy of 86.2%, indicating that URL-based features alone are not adequate to detect phishing websites even with deep ANNs. Since language transformers learn to represent context-dependent text sequences, we hypothesize that they will be able to learn directly from the text in URLs to distinguish between legitimate and malicious websites. We apply two state-of-the-art deep transformers (BERT and ELECTRA) for phishing detection. Testing custom and standard vocabularies, we find that pre-trained transformers available for immediate use (with fine-tuning) outperform the model trained with the custom URL-based vocabulary. Using pre-trained transformers to predict phishing websites from only URLs has four advantages: 1) requires little training time (~8 minutes), 2) is more easily updatable than feature-based approaches because no pre-processing of URLs is required, 3) is safer to use because phishing websites can be predicted without physically visiting the malicious sites and 4) is easily deployable for real-time detection and is applicable to run on mobile devices.",
