  "abstract": "Abstract Motivation The identification and understanding of drug–target interactions (DTIs) play a pivotal role in the drug discovery and development process. Sequence representations of drugs and proteins in computational model offer advantages such as their widespread availability, easier input quality control, and reduced computational resource requirements. These make them an efficient and accessible tools for various computational biology and drug discovery applications. Many sequence-based DTI prediction methods have been developed over the years. Despite the advancement in methodology, cold start DTI prediction involving unknown drug or protein remains a challenging task, particularly for sequence-based models. Introducing DTI-LM, a novel framework leveraging advanced pretrained language models, we harness their exceptional context-capturing abilities along with neighborhood information to predict DTIs. DTI-LM is specifically designed to rely solely on sequence representations for drugs and proteins, aiming to bridge the gap between warm start and cold start predictions. Results Large-scale experiments on four datasets show that DTI-LM can achieve state-of-the-art performance on DTI predictions. Notably, it excels in overcoming the common challenges faced by sequence-based models in cold start predictions for proteins, yielding impressive results. The incorporation of neighborhood information through a graph attention network further enhances prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, a disparity persists between cold start predictions for proteins and drugs. A detailed examination of DTI-LM reveals that language models exhibit contrasting capabilities in capturing similarities between drugs and proteins.
