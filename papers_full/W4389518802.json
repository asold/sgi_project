The code\nis publicly available at https://github.com/\nknowledge-computing/geolm.\n1 Introduction\nSpatial reasoning and semantic understanding of\nnatural language text arise from human communi-\ncations. For example, “I visited Paris in Arkansas\nto see the smaller Eiffel Tower”, a human can eas-\nily recognize the toponyms “Eiffel Tower”, “Paris”,\n“Arkansas”, and the spatial relation “in”. Implic-\nitly, a human can also infer that this “Eiffel Tower”\nmight be a replica 1 of the original one in Paris,\n1 The small Eiffel Tower in Paris, Arkansas, United States:\nhttps://www.arkansas.com/paris/accommodations/\neiffel-tower-park\nFrance. Concretely, the process of geospatially\ngrounded language understanding involves core\ntasks such as recognizing geospatial concepts be-\ning described, inferring the identities of those con-\ncepts, and reasoning about their spatially qualified\nrelations. These tasks are essential for applications\nthat involve the use of place names and their spa-\ntial relations, such as social media message analy-\nsis (Hu et al., 2022), emergency response (Gritta\net al., 2018b), natural disaster analysis (Wang et al.,\n2020), and geographic information retrieval (Wall-\ngrün et al., 2018).\nPretrained language models (PLMs; Devlin et al.\n2019; Liu et al. 2019; Raffel et al. 2020) have seen\nbroad adaptation across various domains such as\nbiology (Lee et al., 2020), healthcare (Alsentzer\net al., 2019), law (Chalkidis et al., 2020; Douka\net al., 2021), software engineering (Tabassum et al.,\n2020), and social media (Röttger and Pierrehum-\nbert, 2021; Guo et al., 2021). These models ben-\nefit from in-domain corpora (e.g., PubMed for\nthe biomedical domain) to learn domain-specific\nterms and concepts. Similarly, a geospatially\ngrounded language model requires training with\ngeo-corpora. The geo-corpora should cover world-\nwide geo-entity names and their variations, geo-\ngraphical locations, and spatial relations to other\ngeo-entities. Although some geo-corpora are avail-\nable, e.g., LGL (Lieberman et al., 2010) and Spa-\ntialML (Mani et al., 2010), the sizes of the datasets\nare relatively small.\nIn contrast, Wikipedia stores many articles de-\nscribing places worldwide and can serve as com-\nprehensive geo-corpora for geospatially grounded\nlanguage understanding. However, training with\nWikipedia only solves partial challenges in geospa-\ntial grounding, as it only provides the linguistic\ncontext of a geo-entity with sentences describing\nhistory, demographics, climate, etc. The infor-\nmation about the geospatial neighbors of a geo-\nentity is still missing. On the other hand, large-\n5227\nFigure 1: Outline of GEOLM. Wikipedia and Wikidata form the NL corpora, and OpenStreetMap (OSM) form\nthe pseudo-sentence corpora (Details in §2.2). GEOLM takes the NL and pseudo-sentence corpora as input, then\npretrain with MLM and contrastive loss using geo-entities as anchors. (See §2.3)\nscale geographical databases (e.g., OpenStreetMap)\nand knowledge bases (e.g., Wikidata) can pro-\nvide extensive amounts of geo-entity locations\nand geospatial relations, enriching the information\nsourced from Wikipedia. Additionally, the geo-\nlocations from OpenStreetMap can help connecting\nthe learned geo-entity representations to physical\nlocations on the Earth.\nTo address these challenges, we propose GE-\nOLM, a language model specifically designed to\nsupport geospatially grounded natural language un-\nderstanding. Our model aims to enhance the com-\nprehension of places, types, and spatial relations\nin natural language. We use Wikipedia, Wikidata,\nand OSM together to create geospatially grounded\ntraining samples using geo-entity names as anchors.\nGEOLM verbalizes the Wikidata relations into nat-\nural language and aligns the linguistic context in\nWikipedia and Wikidata with the geospatial con-\ntext in OSM. Since existing language models do\nnot take geocoordinates as input, GEOLM further\nincorporates a spatial coordinate embedding mod-\nule to learn the distance and directional relations\nbetween geo-entities. During inference, our model\ncan take either natural language or geographical\nsubregion (i.e., a set of nearby geo-entities) as in-\nput and make inferences relying on the aligned\nlinguistic-geospatial information. We employ two\ntraining strategies: contrastive learning (Oord et al.,\n2018) between natural language corpus and lin-\nearized geographic data, and masked language\nmodeling (Devlin et al., 2019) with a concatena-\ntion of these two modalities. We treat GEOLM as\na versatile model capable of addressing various ge-\nographically related language understanding tasks,\nsuch as toponym recognition, toponym linking, and\ngeospatial relation extraction.\n2 G EOLM\nThis section introduces GEOLM’s mechanism for\nrepresenting both the linguistic and geospatial con-\ntext (§2.1), followed by the detailed development\nprocess of pretraining tasks (§2.3) and corpora\n(§2.2), and how GEOLM is further adapted to vari-\nous downstream geospatial NLU tasks (§2.4).\n2.1 Representing Linguistic and Geospatial\nContext\nThe training process of GEOLM aims to simul-\ntaneously learn the linguistic and geospatial con-\ntext, aligning them in the same embedding space to\nobtain geospatially grounded language representa-\ntions. The linguistic contextrefers to the sentential\ncontext of the geographical entity (i.e., geo-entity).\nThe linguistic context contains essential informa-\ntion to specify a geo-entity, including sentences\ndescribing geography, environment, culture, and\nhistory. Additionally, geo-entities exhibit strong\ncorrelations with neighboring geo-entities (Li et al.,\n2022b). We refer to these neighboring geo-entities\nas the geospatial context. The geospatial context\nencompasses locations and implicit geo-relations\nof the neighbors to the center geo-entity. 2\nTo capture the linguistic context, GEOLM takes\nnatural sentences as input and generates entity-level\nrepresentations by averaging the token representa-\ntions within the geo-entity name span. For the\ngeospatial context, GEOLM follows the geospatial\ncontext linearization method and the spatial em-\nbedding module in our previous work SPABERT\n(Li et al., 2022b), a PLM that generates geospa-\ntially contextualized entity representations using\n2Here, we assume that all geo-entities in the geographical\ndataset are represented as points.\n5228\nFigure 2: Sample inputs to GEOLM. Note that segment IDs for the NL tokens are zeros, and for the pseudo-sentence\ntokens are ones.\npoint geographic data. Given a center geo-entity\nand its spatial neighbors, GEOLM linearizes the\ngeospatial context by sorting the neighbors in as-\ncending order based on their geospatial distances\nfrom the center geo-entity. GEOLM then concate-\nnates the name of the center geo-entity and the\nsorted neighbors to form a pseudo-sentence. To\npreserve directional relations and relative distances,\nGEOLM employs the geocoordinates embedding\nmodule, which takes the geocoordinates as input\nand encodes them with a sinusoidal position em-\nbedding layer.\nTo enable GEOLM to process both natural lan-\nguage text and geographical data, we use the fol-\nlowing types of position embedding mechanisms\nfor each token and the token embedding (See\nFig. 2). By incorporating these position embed-\nding mechanisms, GEOLM can effectively process\nboth natural language text and geographical data,\nallowing the model to capture and leverage spatial\ninformation.\nPosition IDdescribes the index position of the\ntoken in the sentence. Note that the position ID for\nboth the NL and geospatial input starts from zero.\nSegment ID indicates the source of the input\ntokens. If the tokens belong to the natural language\ninput, then the segment ID is zero; otherwise one.\nX-coord and Y-coord are inputs for the spatial\ncoordinate embedding. Tokens within the same\ngeo-entity name span share the same X-coord and\nY-coord values. Since NL tokens do not have as-\nsociated geocoordinate information, we set their\nX-coord and Y-coord to be DSEP, which is a con-\nstant value as distance filler.\nIn addition, GEOLM projects the geocoordinates\n(lat, lng) into a 2-dimensional World Equidistant\nCylindrical coordinate system EPSG:4087.3 This\nis because (lat, lng) represent angle-based values\nthat model the 3D sphere, whereas coordinates in\nEPSG:4087 are expressed in Cartesian form. Ad-\nditionally, when generating the pseudo-sentence,\nwe sort neighbors of the center geo-entity based on\nthe Haversine distance which reflects the geodesic\ndistance on Earth instead of the Euclidean distance.\n2.2 Pretraining Corpora\nWe divide the training corpora into two parts:\n1) pseudo-sentence corpora from a geographical\ndataset, OpenStreetMap (OSM), to provide the\ngeospatial context; 2) natural language corpora\nfrom Wikipedia and verbalized Wikidata to pro-\nvide the linguistic context.\nGeographical Dataset.OpenStreetMap (OSM) is\na crowd-sourced geographical database containing\na massive amount of point geo-entities worldwide.\nIn addition, OSM stores the correspondence from\nOSM geo-entity to Wikipedia and Wikidata links.\nWe preprocess worldwide OSM data and gather\nthe geo-entities with Wikidata and Wikipedia links\nto prepare paired training data used in contrastive\npretraining. To linearize geospatial context and\nprepare the geospatial input in Fig. 2, For each\ngeo-entity, we retrieve its geospatial neighbors and\nconstruct pseudo-sentences (See Fig. 1) by con-\ncatenating the neighboring geo-entity names after\nsorting the neighbors by distance. In the end, we\ngenerate 693,308 geo-entities with the same num-\nber of pseudo-sentences in total.\n3 EPSG:4087: https://epsg.io/4087\n5229\nNatural Language Text Corpora.We prepare\nthe text corpora from Wikipedia and Wikidata.\nWikipedia provides a large corpus of encyclope-\ndic articles, with a subset describing geo-entities.\nWe first find the articles describing geo-entities by\nscraping all the Wikipedia links pointed from the\nOSM annotations, then break the articles into sen-\ntences and adopt Trie-based phrase matching (Hsu\nand Ottaviano, 2013) to find the sentences contain-\ning the name of the corresponding OSM geo-entity.\nThe training samples are paragraphs containing\nat least one corresponding OSM geo-entity name.\nFor Wikidata, the procedure is similar to Wikipedia.\nWe collect the Wikidata geo-entities using the QID\nidentifier pointed from the OSM geo-entities. Since\nWikidata stores the relations as triples, we convert\nthe relation triples to natural sentences with a set\nof pre-defined templates (See example in Fig. 1).\nAfter merging the Wikipedia and Wikidata samples,\nwe gather 1,458,150 sentences/paragraphs describ-\ning 472,067 geo-entities.\n2.3 Pretraining Tasks\nWe employ two pretraining tasks to establish con-\nnections between text and geospatial data, enabling\nGEOLM to learn geospatially grounded represen-\ntations of natural language text.\nThe first is a contrastive learningtask using an\nInfoNCE loss (Oord et al., 2018), which contrasts\nbetween the geo-entity features extracted from the\ntwo modalities. This loss encourages GEOLM to\ngenerate similar representations for the same geo-\nentity, regardless of whether the representation is\ncontextualized based on the linguistic or geospatial\ncontext. Simultaneously, GEOLM learns to dis-\ntinguish between geo-entities that share the same\nname by maximizing the distances of their repre-\nsentations in the embedding space.\nFormally, let the training data Dconsist of pairs\nof samples (snl\ni ,sgeo\ni ), where snl\ni is a linguistic\nsample (a natural sentence or a verbalized rela-\ntion from a knowledge base), and sgeo\ni is a pseudo-\nsentence created from the geographic data. Both\nsamples mention the same geo-entity. Let f(·) be\nGEOLM that takes both snl\ni and sgeo\ni as input and\nproduces entity-level representation hnl\ni = f(snl\ni )\nand hgeo\ni = f(sgeo\ni ). Then the loss function is:\nLcontrast\ni = −log esim(hnl\ni ,hgeo\ni )/τ\n∑2N\nj=1 1 [j̸ =i]esim(hnl\ni ,hgeo\nj )/τ,\nFigure 3: Downstream tasks to evaluate geospatially\ngrounded language understanding.\nwhere τ is a temperature, and sim(·) denotes the\ncosine similarity.\nTo improve GEOLM’s ability to disambiguate\ngeo-entities, we include in-batch hard negatives\ncomprising geo-entities with identical names. As\na result, each batch is composed of 50% random\nnegatives and 50% hard negatives.\nAdditionally, we employ a masked language\nmodeling task (Devlin et al., 2019) on a concate-\nnation of the paired natural language sentence and\ngeographical pseudo-sentence (Fig. 2). This task\nencourages GEOLM to recover masked tokens by\nleveraging both linguistic and geographical data.\n2.4 Downstream Tasks\nOur study further adapts GEOLM to several down-\nstream tasks to demonstrate its ability for geospa-\ntially grounded language understanding, including\ntoponym recognition, toponym linking, geo-entity\ntyping, and geospatial relation extraction (Fig. 3).\nToponym recognitionor geo-tagging (Gritta et al.,\n2020) is to extract toponyms (i.e., place names)\nfrom unstructured text. This is a crucial step in\nrecognizing geo-entities mentioned in the text be-\nfore inferring their identities and relationships in\nsubsequent tasks. We frame this task as a multi-\nclass sequence tagging problem, where tokens are\nclassified into one of three classes: B-topo (begin-\nning of a toponym), I-topo (inside a toponym),\nor O (non-toponym). To accomplish this, we ap-\npend a fully connected layer to GEOLM and train\nthe model end-to-end on a downstream dataset to\nclassify each token from the text input.\nToponym linking, also referred to as toponym res-\n5230\nolution and geoparsing (Gritta et al., 2020, 2018a;\nHu et al., 2022), aims to infer the identity or geoco-\nordinates of a mentioned geo-entity in the text by\ngrounding geo-entity mention to the correct record\nin a geographical database, which might contain\nmany candidate entities with the same name as the\nextracted toponym from the text. During inference,\nwe process the candidate geo-entities from the ge-\nographical databases the same way as during pre-\ntraining, where nearby neighbors are concatenated\ntogether to form pseudo-sentences. For this task,\nwe perform zero-shot linking by directly applying\nGEOLM without fine-tuning. GEOLM extracts\nrepresentations of geo-entities from linguistic data\nand calculates representations for all candidate en-\ntities. After obtaining the representations for both\nquery and candidate geo-entities, the linking results\nare formed as a ranked list of candidates sorted by\ncosine similarity in the feature space.\nGeo-entity typingis the task of categorizing the\ntypes of locations in a geographical database (e.g.,\nOpenStreetMap) (Li et al., 2022b). Geo-entity typ-\ning helps us understand the characteristics of a\nregion and can be useful for location-based recom-\nmendations. We treat this task as a classification\nproblem and append a one-layer classification head\nafter GEOLM. We trainGEOLM to predict the type\nof the central geo-entity given a subregion of a geo-\ngraphical area. To accomplish this, we construct a\npseudo-sentence following Fig. 1, then compute the\nrepresentation of the geo-entity using GEOLM and\nfeed the representation to the classification head\nfor training.\nGeospatial relation extractionis the task of clas-\nsifying topological relations between a pair of lo-\ncations (Mani et al., 2010). We treat this task as\nan entity pair classification problem. We compute\nthe average embedding of tokens to form the entity\nembedding and then concatenate the embeddings\nof the subject and object entities to use as input\nfor the classifier, then predict the relationship type\nwith a softmax classifier.\n3 Experiments\nWe hereby evaluate GEOLM on the aforemen-\ntioned four downstream tasks. All compared mod-\nels (except GPT3.5) are finetuned on task-specific\ndatasets for toponym recognition, geo-entity typ-\ning, and geospatial relation extraction.4\n4Toponym linking is an unsupervised task.\n3.1 Toponym Recognition\nTask Setup.We adoptGEOLM for toponym recog-\nnition on the GeoWebNews (Gritta et al., 2020)\ndataset. This dataset contains 200 news articles\nwith 2,601 toponyms.5 The annotation includes the\nstart and end character positions (i.e., the spans)\nof the toponyms in paragraphs. We use 80% for\ntraining and 20% for testing.\nEvaluation Metrics.We report precision, recall,\nand F1, and include both token-level scores and\nentity-level scores. For entity-level scores, a pre-\ndiction is considered correct only when it matches\nexactly with the ground-truth mention (i.e., no miss-\ning or partial overlap).\nModels in Comparison.We compare GEOLM\nwith fine-tuned PLMs including BERT, SimCSE-\nBERT6 (Gao et al., 2021) , SpanBERT (Joshi et al.,\n2020) and SapBERT (Liu et al., 2021). SpanBERT\nis a BERT-based model with span prediction pre-\ntraining. Instead of masking out random tokens,\nSpanBERT masks out a continuous span and tries\nto recover the missing parts using the tokens right\nnext to the masking boundary. SapBERT learns to\nalign biomedical entities through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning.7 We compare all models in\nbase versions.\nResults and Discussion. Tab. 1 shows that our\nGEOLM yields the highest entity-level F1 score,\nwith BERT being the close second. Since GE-\nOLM’s weights are initialized from BERT, the\nimprovement over BERT shows the effectiveness\nof in-domain training with geospatial grounding.\nFor token-level results, SpanBERT has the best\nF1 score for I-topo, showing that span prediction\nduring pretraining is beneficial for predicting the\ncontinuation of toponyms. However, GEOLM is\nbetter at predicting the start token of the toponym,\nwhich SpanBERT does not perform as well.\n3.2 Toponym Linking\nTask Setup.We run unsupervised toponym linking\non two benchmark datasets: Local Global Corpus\n(LGL; Lieberman et al. 2010) and Wikipedia To-\n5We only consider the place names associated with valid\ngeocoordinates as toponyms and do not count the literal ex-\npression (e.g., the word “street”, “blocks” and “intersection”)\nas toponyms.\n6We use the unsupervised pretrained weights.\n7Although SapBERT is trained with biomedical corpus, it\ngeneralizes well on geo-entity recognition and linking since\nthe study of diseases often relates to places and regions.\n5231\nGeoWebNews Token(B-topo) Token (I-topo) micro- Entity\nPrec Recall F1 Prec Recall F1 F1 Prec Recall F1\nBERT 90.00 89.28 89.64 78.55 79.44 78.99 84.46 77.03 83.42 80.10\nSimCSE-BERT 83.86 90.26 86.95 74.61 82.07 78.16 82.67 72.76 83.68 77.84\nSpanBERT 85.98 88.37 87.16 86.13 89.19 87.63 87.38 75.32 81.16 78.13\nSapBERT 83.12 88.32 85.64 76.26 81.11 78.61 82.22 72.48 80.16 76.12\nGEOLM 91.15 90.43 90.79 79.16 84.27 81.63 86.33 82.18 85.67 83.89\nTable 1: Toponym recognition results on GeoWebNews dataset.

The\ntwo left figures are BERT results, and the two right figures are GEOLM results. The colored circles in the figure\ndenote all the geo-entities named “Paris” in the GeoNames database. The circle’s color represents the cosine\nsimilarity (or ranking score) between the candidate geo-entitity from GeoNames and the query toponym Paris. It is\nworth noting that the BERT predictions are almost the same given the two sentences because BERT does not align\nthe linguistic context with the geospatial context.\nponym Retrieval (WikToR; Gritta et al. 2018b).\nLGL contains 588 news articles with 4,462 to-\nponyms that have been linked to the GeoNames\ndatabase. This dataset has ground-truth geoco-\nordinates and GeoNames ID annotations. This\ndataset has only one sample with a unique name\n(among 4,462 samples in total). On average, each\ntoponym corresponds to 27.52 geo-entities with\nthe same in GeoNames. WikToR is derived from\n5,000 Wikipedia pages, where each page describes\na unique place. This dataset also contains many\ntoponyms that share the same lexical form but refer\nto distinct geo-entities. For example, Santa Maria,\nLima, and Paris are the top ambiguous place names.\nFor WikToR, there is no sample with a unique\nname. The least ambiguous one has four candidate\ngeo-entities with the same name in GeoNames. On\naverage, each toponym corresponds to 70.45 geo-\nentities with the same name in GeoNames. This\ndataset is not linked with the GeoNames database,\nbut the ground-truth geocoordinates of the toponym\nare provided instead.\nEvaluation Metrics.For LGL, we evaluate model\nperformance using two metrics. 1) R@kis a stan-\ndard retrieval metric that computes the recall of\nthe top- k prediction based on the ground-truth\nGeoNames ID. 2) P@D, following previous studies\n(Gritta et al., 2018b), computes the distance-based\napproximation rate of the top-ranked prediction. If\nthe prediction falls within the distance threshold\nD from the ground truth geocoordinates, we con-\nsider the prediction as a correct approximation. 8\n8Here, P@D161 is the same as Acc@161km (or\nAcc@100miles ) reported by Gritta et al. (2018b).\n5232\nLGL R@1 R@5 R@10 P@D 161\nBERT 34.6 67.5 78.1 41.2\nRoBERTa 24.2 48.7 60.6 27.9\nSpanBERT 25.2 48.8 61.0 28.8\nSapBERT 30.8 58.8 72.2 35.1\nGEOLM 38.2 65.3 72.6 44.1\nWikToR P@D20 P@D50 P@D100 P@D161\nBERT 16.1 16.3 16.9 17.6\nRoBERTa 11.7 11.9 12.4 13.0\nSpanBERT 5.5 5.7 5.9 6.3\nSapBERT 25.9 26.3 27.0 28.3\nGEOLM 32.5 33.4 34.3 35.8\nTable 2: Toponym linking results on LGL and Wik-\nTOR datasets. Bolded numbers are the best scores\nand underlined numbers are the second-best scores.\nR@k measures whether ground-truth GeoNames ID\npresents among the top kretrieval results. P@D mea-\nsures whether the top retrieval is within the distance D\nfrom the ground-truth. D20, D50 , D100 and D161 indi-\ncate the distance thresholds of {20, 50, 100, 161} km.\nFor WikToR, the ground-truth geocoordinates are\ngiven, and we follow Gritta et al. (2020, 2018b) to\nreport P@D metrics with various D values.\nModels in Comparison.We compare GEOLM\nwith multiple PLMs, including BERT, RoBETRa,\nSpanBERT (Joshi et al., 2020) and SapBERT (Liu\net al., 2021). In the experiments, we use all base\nversions of the above models. For a fair compar-\nison, to calculate the representation of the candi-\ndate entity, we concatenate the center entity’s name\nand its neighbors’ names then input the concate-\nnated sequence (i.e., pseudo-sentence) to all base-\nline PLMs to provide the linguistic context, follow-\ning the same unsupervised procedure as in §2.4.\nResults and Discussion. One challenge of this\ntask is that the input sentences may not have any\ninformation about their neighbor entities; thus, in-\nstead of only considering the linguistic context or\nrelying on neighboring entities to appear in the\nsentence, GEOLM’s novel approach aligns the lin-\nguistic and geospatial context so that GEOLM can\neffectively map the geo-entity embeddings learned\nfrom the linguistic context in articles to the embed-\ndings learned from the geospatial context in geo-\ngraphic data and perform linking. The contrastive\nlearning process during pretraining is designed to\nhelp the context alignment. From Tab. 2, GEOLM\noffers more reliable performance than baselines.\nOn WikTor and LGL datasets,GEOLM obtains the\nbest or second-best scores in all metrics. On LGL,\nGEOLM demonstrates more precise top-1 retrieval\n(R@1) than other models, and also the highest\nscores on P@D161. Since baselines are able to har-\nness only the linguistic context, while GEOLM can\nuse the linguistic and geospatial context when tak-\ning sentences as input. The improvement of R@1\nand P@D161 from BERT shows the effectiveness\nof the geospatial context. On WikToR, GEOLM\nperforms the best on all metrics. Since WikToR\nhas many geo-entities with the same names, the\nscores of GEOLM indicate strong disambiguation\ncapability obtained from aligning the linguistic and\ngeospatial context.\nFig. 4 shows the visualization of the toponym\nlinking results given “Paris” mentioned in two sen-\ntences. The input sentences are provided in the\nfigures. Apparently, the first Paris should be linked\nto Paris, France, and the second Paris goes to\nParis, AK, US. However, the BERT model fails\nto ground these two mentions into the correct loca-\ntions. BERT ranks the candidate geo-entities only\nslightly differently for the two input sentences, in-\ndicating that BERT relies more on the geo-entity\nname rather than the linguistic context when per-\nforming prediction. On the other hand, our model\ncould predict the correct location of geo-entities.\nThis is because even though the lexical forms of\nthe geo-entity names (i.e., Paris) are the same, the\nlinguistic context describing the geo-entity are dis-\ntinct. Fig. 4 demonstrate that the contrastive learn-\ning helps GEOLM to map the linguistic context to\nthe geospatial context in the embedding space.\n3.3 Geo-entity Typing\nTask Setup. We apply GEOLM on the super-\nvised geo-entity typing dataset released by Li et al.\n(2022b). The goal is to classify the type of the cen-\nter geo-entity providing the geospatial neighbors\nas context. We linearize the set of geo-entities to a\npseudo-sentence that represent the geospatial con-\ntext for the center geo-entity then feed the pseudo-\nsentence into GEOLM. There are 33,598 pseudo-\nsentences for nine amenity classes, with 80% for\ntraining and 20% for testing. We train multiple\nlanguage models to perform amenity-type classifi-\ncation for the center geo-entity.\nEvaluation Metric.Following (Li et al., 2022b),\nwe report the F1 score for each class and the micro\nF1 for all the samples.\nModels in Comparison. In addition to BERT,\nSpanBERT and SimCSE-BERT, this task also takes\nLUKE (Yamada et al., 2020) and SpaBERT (Li\n5233\nClasses → Edu. Ent. Fac. Fin. Hea. Pub. Sus. Tra. Was.

LUKE is designed\nto solve entity-related tasks with a specially de-\nsigned entity tokenizer. SpaBERT generates geo-\nentity representations given small geographical re-\ngions as input. In addition, BERT, SpanBERT,\nSimCSE-BERT, and LUKE rely only on linguistic\ninformation, and SpaBERT relies only on geospa-\ntial context to make predictions.\nResults and Discussion. Tab. 3 shows that the\nperformance of GEOLM surpasses the baseline\nmodels using only linguistic or geospatial informa-\ntion. The experiment demonstrates that combining\nthe information from both modalities and aligning\nthe context is useful for geo-entity type inference.\nCompared to the second best model, SpaBERT,\nGEOLM has robust improvement on seven types.\nThe result indicates that the contrastive learning\nduring pretraining helps GEOLM to align the lin-\nguistic context and geospatial context, and although\nonly geospatial context is provided as input during\ninference, GEOLM can still employ the aligned\nlinguistic context to facilitate the type prediction.\n3.4 Geospatial Relation Extraction\nTask Setup.We apply GEOLM to the SpatialML\ntopological relation extraction dataset released\nby Mani et al. (2010). Given a sentence containing\nmultiple entities, the model classifies the relations\nbetween each pair of entities into six types9 (includ-\n9The types come from the RCC8 relations, which contain\neight types of geospatial relations. The SpatialML dataset\nmerges four of the relations (TPP, TPPi, NTTP, NTTPi) into\nthe “IN” relation thus resulting in five geo-relations in the\ndataset.\nFigure 5: Relation extraction results on SpatialML com-\nparing with other baseline models.\ning an NA class indicating that there is no relation).\nThe dataset consists of 1,528 sentences, with 80%\nfor training and 20% for testing. Within the dataset,\nthere are a total of 10,592 entity pairs, of which\n10,232 pairs do not exhibit any relation.\nEvaluation Metric.We report the micro F1 score\non the test dataset. We exclude the NA instances\nwhen calculating the F1 score.\nModels in Comparison.We compare GEOLM\nwith other pretrained language models, including\nBERT, RoBERTa, and SpanBERT, as well as a\nlarge language model (LLM), GPT-3.5.\nResults and Discussion. Fig. 5 shows that GE-\nOLM achieves the best F1. The results suggest that\nGEOLM effectively captures the topological rela-\ntionships between entities. Furthermore, GEOLM\ndemonstrates a better ability to learn geospatial\ngrounding between the mentioned entities.\n3.5 Ablation Study\nWe conduct two ablation experiments to validate\nthe model design using toponym recognition and\ntoponym linking: 1) removing the spatial coordi-\nnate embedding layer that takes the geo coordinates\nas input during the training; 2) removing the con-\ntrastive loss that encourages the model to learn\nsimilar geo-entity embeddings from two types of\ncontext (i.e., linguistic context and geospatial con-\ntext) and only applying MLM on the NL corpora.\nFor the toponym recognition task, we compare\n5234\nthe entity-level precision, recall, and F1 scores on\nthe GeoWebNews dataset. Tab. 4 shows that re-\nmoving either component could cause performance\ndegradation. For the toponym linking task, in\nthe first ablation experiment, the linking accuracy\n(P@D161, i.e., Acc@161km or Acc@100miles)\ndrops from 0.358 to 0.321 after removing the spa-\ntial coordinate embedding, indicating that the geo-\ncoordinate information is beneficial and our em-\nbedding layer design is effective. In the second ab-\nlation experiment, the linking accuracy (P@D161)\ndrops from 0.358 to 0.146, showing that contrastive\nlearning is essential.\n4 Related Work\nGeospatial NLU.Understanding geospatial con-\ncepts in natural language has long been a topic of\ninterest. Previous studies (Liu et al., 2022; Hu,\n2018; Wang and Hu, 2019) have used general-\npurpose NER tools such as Stanford NER (Finkel\net al., 2005) and NeuroNER (Dernoncourt et al.,\n2017) to identify toponyms in text. In the geo-\ngraphic information system (GIS) domain, tools\nsuch as the Edinburgh geoparser (Grover et al.,\n2010; Tobin et al., 2010a), Yahoo! Placemaker10\nand Mordecai (Halterman, 2017, 2023) have been\ndeveloped to detect toponyms and link them to\ngeographical databases. Also, several heuristics-\nbased approaches have been proposed (Woodruff\nand Plaunt, 1994; Amitay et al., 2004; Tobin et al.,\n2010b) to limit the spatial range of gazetteers\nand associate the toponym with the most likely\ngeo-entity (e.g., most populous ones). More re-\ncently, deep learning models have been adopted\nto establish the connection between extracted to-\nponyms and geographical databases (Gritta et al.,\n2017, 2018a; DeLozier et al., 2015). For instance,\nTopoCluster (DeLozier et al., 2015) learns the as-\nsociation between words and geographic locations,\nderiving a geographic likelihood for each word in\nthe vocabulary. Similarly, CamCoder (Gritta et al.,\n2018a) introduces an algorithm that encodes to-\nponym mentions in a geodesic vector space, predict-\ning the final location based on geodesic and lexical\nfeatures. These models utilize supervised training,\nwhich assumes that the testing and training data\ncover the same region. However, this assumption\nmay limit their applicability in scenarios where the\ntesting and training regions differ. Furthermore, Yu\n10Yahoo! placemaker: https://simonwillison.net/\n2009/May/20/placemaker/\nand Lu (2015) use keyword extraction approach\nand Yang et al. (2022) use language model based\n(e.g., BERT) classification to solve the geospatial\nrelation extraction problem. However, these mod-\nels often struggle to incorporate the geospatial con-\ntext of the text during inference. Our previous work\nSpaBERT (Li et al., 2022b) is related to GEOLM\nin terms of representing the geospatial context. It is\na language model trained on geographical datasets.\nAlthough SpaBERT can learn geospatial informa-\ntion, it does not fully employ linguistic information\nduring inference.\nGEOLM is specifically designed to align the lin-\nguistic and geospatial context within a joint embed-\nding space through MLM and contrastive learning.\nLanguage Grounding. Language grounding in-\nvolves mapping the NL component to other modal-\nities, and it encompasses several areas of research.\nIn particular, vision-language grounding has gained\nsignificant attention, with popular approaches in-\ncluding contrastive learning (Radford et al., 2021;\nJia et al., 2021; You et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022a)\nand (masked) vision-language model on distantly\nparallel multi-modal corpora (Chen et al., 2020,\n2021; Su et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Addition-\nally, knowledge graph grounding has been explored\nwith similar strategies (He et al., 2021; Wang et al.,\n2021). GEOLM leverages both contrastive learn-\ning and MLM on distantly parallel geospatial and\nlinguistic data, and it represents a pilot study on the\ngrounded understanding of these two modalities.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we propose GEOLM, a PLM for\ngeospatially grounded language understanding.\nThis model can handle both natural language in-\nputs and geospatial data inputs, and provide con-\nnected representation for both modalities. Tech-\nnically, GEOLM conducts contrastive and MLM\npretraining on a massive collection of distantly par-\nallel language and geospatial corpora, and incorpo-\nrates a geocoordinate embedding mechanism for\nimproved spatial characterization. Through evalua-\ntions on four important downstream tasks, toponym\nrecognition, toponym linking, geo-entity typing\nand geospatial relation extraction, GEOLM has\ndemonstrated competent and comprehensive abili-\nties for geospatially grounded NLU. In the future,\nwe plan to extend the work to question answering\nand autoregressive tasks.\n5235\nLimitations\nThe current version of our model only uses point ge-\nometry to represent the geospatial context, ignoring\npolygons and polylines. Future work can expand\nthe model’s capabilities to handle those complex\ngeometries. Also, it is important to note that the\nOpenStreetMap data were collected through crowd-\nsourcing, which introduces possible labeling noise\nand bias. Lastly, model pre-training was conducted\non a GPU with at least 24GB of memory. Attempt-\ning to train the model on GPUs with smaller mem-\nory may lead to memory constraints and degraded\nperformance.\nEthics Statement\nThe model weights in our research are initialized\nfrom a pretrained BERT model for English. In ad-\ndition, the training data used in our research are\nprimarily extracted from crowd-sourced databases,\nincluding OpenStreetMap (OSM), Wikipedia, and\nWikidata. Although these sources provide exten-\nsive geographical coverage, the geographical distri-\nbution of training data exhibits significant dispar-\nities, with Europe having the most abundant data.\nAt the same time, Central America and Antarctica\nare severely underrepresented, with less than 1% of\nthe number of samples compared to Europe. This\nuneven training data distribution may introduce bi-\nases in the model’s performance, particularly in\nregions with limited annotated samples.\nAcknowledgements\nWe appreciate the reviewers for their insightful\ncomments and suggestions.

IEEE.\nA Distribution of Geo-entities\nWe analyze the distribution of geo-entities in the\npretraining corpora and the downstream datasets.\nWhen considering only the name (without geoco-\nordinates), the overlapping percentages of the pre-\ntraining data and downstream datasets are shown in\nTab. 5. Ablation experiments show that for the geo-\nentities already included during the pretraining, the\naverage P@D161 score is 0.362. For the ones that\nare not included during the pretraining, the average\nP@D161 score is 0.341, which is not significantly\ndifferent from the prior one. This indicates that the\nimproved performance of GEOLM comparing with\nother models benefits from enhancing the geospa-\ntial representations.\nB Comparison with Other Methods\nFor the toponym recognition task, we compare\nthe results of GEOLM with other existing mod-\nels designed specifically for this problem. Ac-\ncording to (Gritta et al., 2020), the token-level F1\nachieved by Yahoo! Placemaker, Edinburgh Geop-\narser, Spacy NLP, Google Cloud Natural Language,\nand NCRF++ are 63.2%, 63.6%, 74.9%, 83.2%\nand 88.6% respectively. GEOLM has a token-level\nF1 of 86.3%, which is better than all existing ones\nexcept NCRF++. The reason is that NCRF++ uses\nfine-grained toponym taxonomy to boost the to-\nponym recognition performance. However, the fine-\ngrained labels can sometimes be difficult to collect\nfor large-scale datasets. In addition, NCRF++ is a\nspecific toponym recognition model that does not\nsupport other geospatial-inference tasks. With GE-\nOLM, we can generate representations useful for\nvarious tasks.\nFor the toponym linking task, we compare our\nmodel with the other existing geoparser models\nmentioned in EUPEG (Hu, 2018) and V oting (Hu\net al., 2023), including CLA VIN 11, TopoClus-\nter (DeLozier et al., 2015), CamCoder (Gritta\net al., 2018a), Modecai (Halterman, 2017), GENRE\n(De Cao et al., 2020), and V oting (Hu et al., 2023).\nSince EUPEG evaluates the toponym resolution\nand toponym linking together and does not provide\n11CLA VIN:https://github.com/Novetta/CLAVIN\nFigure 6: Example of the constructed Trie if Open-\nStreetMap only contains “Los Angeles”, “Los Angeles\nCounty”, “Los Angeles Elementary School”, “Los Ca-\nbos” and “Las Vegas”. Each node is a word in a place\nname. The gray color indicates that this node is the last\nword of a place name.\nthe scores for linking only, we use the scores re-\nported in V oting, which assumes gold toponyms as\ninputs for toponym linking (same as ours).\nThe scores in P@D161 (or Accuracy@161km)\nare shown in Tab. 6. The models that perform better\nthan GEOLM are all supervised learning models\n(i.e. CamCoder, GENRE and V oting) while GE-\nOLM is unsupervised. Within the unsupervised\ngroup, GEOLM performs the best. The benefit\nof the unsupervised nature of GEOLM is that GE-\nOLM can handle new samples without the need for\nextra training data, which is often difficult to gather.\nAlso, new geo-entity names can appear in docu-\nments and the way people call the same geo-entity\ncan change over time, the unsupervised approach\nhas the advantage of handling ever-changing doc-\numents, e.g., online text, while the supervised ap-\nproach focuses on existing names of geo-entities.\nWe acknowledge that there is a gap between GE-\nOLM and the domain-specific geoparsers, and we\nwill aim to narrow this gap in the future.\nC Trie\nTrie supports a tree structure for efficient search\nfor geo-entity names, and it helps distinguish be-\ntween two geo-entities with shared substrings in\ntheir names. For example, Trie helps extract the\ngeo-entity “Los Angeles High School” from the\nsentence “I work at the Los Angeles High School,”\ninstead of extracting the geo-entity “Los Angeles”.\nFig. 6 shows an example Trie constructed from a\nset of geo-entity names.\nWe use all geo-entity names in the worldwide\nOpenStreetMap database to construct a worldwide\nTrie, where each node is a single word in the name.\nWhen using Trie to preprocess the Wikipedia doc-\numents, we apply the Trie searching to find all\n5239\nTasks Dataset # Total Records # Intersection Percentage\nToponym Recognition GeoWebNews 912 325 35.6%\nToponym Linking WikToR 1886 1280 67.9%\nGeo-entity Typing OpenStreetMap Subset 23195 544 2.3%\nRelation Extraction SpatialML 309 91 29.4%\nTable 5: The number of geo-entities in the downstream datasets, and the overlapping portion of geo-entities with\nthe pretraining corpora.\nUnsupervised Supervised\nModecai 0.15 CamCoder 0.63\nCLA VIN 0.22 GENRE 0.81\nTopoCluster 0.24 V oting 0.85\nGEOLM (ours) 0.35\nTable 6: Comparison with other toponym linking mod-\nels in both unsupervised and supervised category.\nTypes Keywords\nOthers Other; No relation\nEqual (EQ) EQ\nDisconnected (DC) DC\nExternally connected (EC) EC\nWithin (IN) In; Within\nPartially overlapping (PO) PO\nTable 7: Relation types and the corresponding accept-\nable keywords in GPT outputs\nthe mentioned geo-entity names. To mitigate the\ndisambiguation error, we use the Wikipedia page\ntitle to filter out the mentions that do not describe\nthe “entity-of-interest”. After this step, the dis-\nambiguation error only occurs when two distinct\ngeo-entities with the same name occur on the same\nWikipedia page, which is pretty rare. This does\nnot fully resolve the disambiguation error issue,\nand there may still be noises in the training data.\nHowever, as long as most of the data is clean,\nthe model can still learn meaningful information\nfrom the data. Thus we have compiled a quite\nlarge pretraining NL corpora with 1,458,150 sen-\ntences/paragraphs describing 472,067 geo-entities.\nD GPT-3.5 Prompt\nWe use GPT-3.5-turbo to help predict the rela-\ntions between two geo-entities. With the system\nrole, we prompt the model with the general task\ndescription and ask the model to choose from one\nof the possible relationships. With theuser role, we\nprovide the input sentence and the two geo-entity\nnames. The example prompt is shown below.\n• System:Given a sentence, and two entities\nwithin the sentence, classify the relationship\nbetween the two entities based on the pro-\nvided sentence. All possible Relationships are\nlisted below: [ disconnected (DC): Entity A\nand B have no spatial intersection, both in\nterms of interiors and boundaries; externally\nconnected (EC): Entity A and B touch each\nother only at their boundaries; equal (EQ):\nEntity A and B are identical; partially overlap-\nping (PO): Interiors of entity A and B overlap\nbut neither is completely contained within the\nother; within (IN): One entity is part of the\nother entity; Others: No relation between en-\ntities]\n• User: Sentence: {input-sentence} Entity1:\n{entity1-name} Entity2: {entity2-name} Re-\nlationship:\nTo address the randomness in the GPT outputs\nand robustly evaluate the performance, we only\nlook for some particular keywords from the GPT\noutputs. If the output contains the desired keyword,\nwe consider the prediction as correct. Tab. 7 lists\nthe keywords for each relation type.\n5240",
