    "abstract": "We present an extensible API for integrating language modeling and realization, describing its design and efficient implementation in the OpenCCG surface realizer. With OpenCCG, language models may be used to select realizations with preferred word orders, promote alignment with a conversational partner, avoid repetitive language use, and increase the speed of the best-first anytime search. The API enables a variety of n-gram models to be easily combined and used in conjunction with appropriate edge pruning strategies. The n-gram models may be of any order, operate in reverse (\"right-to-left\"), and selectively replace certain words with their semantic classes. Factored language models with generalized backoff may also be employed, over words represented as bundles of factors such as form, pitch accent, stem, part of speech, supertag, and semantic class.",
