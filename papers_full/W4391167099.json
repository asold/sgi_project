The forum was attended by over 40 \nindividuals, representing 30 biomedical imaging jour -\nnals from 9 countries. In addition to considering the May \n2023 ICMJE update [1], the editors considered relevant \nstatements regarding contributions by AI-assisted tech -\nnologies from other publication committees, associa -\ntions, and societies, including the World Association of \nMedical Editors (WAME), the Committee on Publication \nEthics (COPE), and the Council of Science Editors (CSE) \npolicies [2–4]. New NIH guidelines to address the role of \ngenerative AI-assisted review of submitted applications \nwere also reviewed [5], as well as policies developed by \nvarious medical journals and medical publishers [6–12]. \nAt the conclusion of the forum, the following policies \nwere endorsed in principle. With this article, the Editors-\nin-Chief of the ESR Journals adapt these policies to their \njournals. It is obvious that generative AI tools will con -\ntinue to quickly evolve and develop new possibilities in \nour daily lives. The statements and policies will need to \nbe re-evaluated and updated regularly.\nAI or AI‑assisted technologies do not qualify as authors \nand must not be listed as authors or co‑authors [1–3, 6–11]\nNonhuman AI, LLMs, chatbots, machine learning, or \nsimilar generative AI technologies do not meet the four \nICMJE criteria for authorship. These qualifications \nwere developed to guarantee that all authors accept full \nresponsibility and stand for the integrity of the entire \nwork. Accordingly, only humans can be authors [2]. \nAI-assisted technologies that were used to generate \nresults should be reported in the article as methodologi -\ncal devices used in the completion of the work, but not \nincluded as authors.\nAuthors must disclose at submission whether they used AI \nor AI‑assisted technologies in their work\nAuthors who use such technology must clearly describe \nhow AI or AI-assisted technologies were used in the \nstudy and/or manuscript preparation. Authors should \nbe transparent when AI-assisted technologies are used \nand provide information about their use [2, 3]. If the \ntools were part of carrying out the research and to gener -\nate results, authors must provide this information in the \nMaterials and Methods section or in the relevant section \nof the manuscript (e.g., figure legends for AI-generated \nfigures) [9]. In all cases of use of AI-assisted technolo -\ngies, authors should include specific details, such as the \nThis article is a joint statement by the three Editors‑in‑Chief of the ESR \nJournals, published simultaneously in European Radiology (DOI: https:// doi. \norg/ 10. 1007/ s00330‑ 023‑ 10511‑8), Insights into Imaging (DOI: https:// doi. org/ \n10. 1186/ s13244‑ 023‑ 01600‑9), and European Radiology Experimental (DOI: \nhttps:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s41747‑ 023‑ 00420‑2).\n*Correspondence:\nBernd Hamm\nbernd.hamm@european‑radiology.org\nLuis Marti‑Bonmati\neic@i3‑journal.org\nFrancesco Sardanelli\neditor@er‑x.org\n1 European Society of Radiology (ESR), Vienna, Austria\nPage 2 of 3Hamm et al. Insights into Imaging           (2024) 15:18 \nname and version of the AI tool, date of access, name of \nthe manufacturer/creator [6, 7, 9, 10].\nAuthors must disclose at submission whether they used \nAI or AI‑assisted technologies for writing or editing \nthe manuscript\nAuthors may use LLMs to assist with medical writ -\ning and for content editing to effectively communicate \ntheir work. These tasks include assistance with medi -\ncal writing, grammar, language and reporting stand -\nards. Authors must transparently report how they \nused such tools in the writing or editing of their sub -\nmitted work in the Acknowledgment section. Authors \nare encouraged to include specific details, such as the \nname of the language model or tool, version number, \nand manufacturer [9 , 10].\nAll authors are fully responsible for any submitted material \nthat includes AI‑assisted technologies\nAI-assisted technologies cannot distinguish between true \nand false information. Humans, i.e., the authors, are and \nremain fully responsible for the submitted manuscript. \nAuthors should carefully review and edit the results of \nAI-assisted content, because AI can generate authorita -\ntive-sounding output that can be biased, incomplete, or \npartially or completely incorrect [1].\nAuthors should be able to assert that there is no plagiarism \nin their paper, including in text and images produced by AI\nHumans must ensure appropriate attribution to all \nquoted material, including full citations [1]. Authors \nshould acknowledge all sources (including material pro -\nduced by AI-assisted tools) [2, 6–11]. Authorship attri -\nbution requires accountability for the submitted work. \nFurther, authors are responsible for any text generated \nby an AI-assisted tool in their manuscript (including the \naccuracy of what is presented and the absence of plagia -\nrism) and for acknowledging all sources (including mate -\nrial produced by the AI-assisted tool) and ensuring the \naccuracy and completeness of citations [2]. AI-generated \nmaterial cannot be referenced as primary source [1].\nAny content created by AI or AI‑assisted tools must be \nlabelled\nThe submission and publication of content/images cre -\nated by AI, language models, machine learning, or sim -\nilar technologies is discouraged, unless it is part of the \nformal research design or methods, and is not permit -\nted without clear labelling, meaning a description of \nthe content that was created, the name of the model or \ntool, version and extension numbers, and manufacturer \n[6]. Authors are fully responsible for the integrity of the \ncontent generated by these models and tools [6 ]. When \ngenerative AI itself is the focus of a study, the use of AI \nshould be explicitly detailed in the Materials and Meth -\nods section [9].\nReviewers and editors are obligated to confidentiality \nand should not upload manuscripts to software or other \nAI‑assisted tools where confidentiality cannot be assured \n[1, 2]\nReviewers and editors are trusted and required to main -\ntain confidentiality throughout the manuscript review \nprocess. Authors trust the reviewers and editors to protect \ntheir proprietary, sensitive, and confidential ideas. The use \nof AI-assisted tools may violate peer review confidential -\nity expectations, and several journals have followed the \nICJME and WAME guidelines and state that entering \nany part of the manuscript or abstract or the text of your \nreview into a chatbot, language model, or similar tool is \na violation of the journals’ confidentiality agreement [7 , \n9, 12]. The review process is valued for its human expert \nperspective and human oversight with decision-making in \nscholarly publication, including the need for accountability \nand human oversight [9, 13]. If a reviewer or editor used \nan AI tool as a resource for his/her review in a way that \ndoes not violate the journal’s confidentiality policy, he/she \nmust provide the name of the tool and how it was used.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Editors‑in‑Chief of the ESR Journals thank Linda Moy for leading the \nconsensus and writing process.
