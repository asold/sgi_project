INTRODUCTION \nThe power transformer is one of the most important and expensive facility in the power \nsystem [1]. It holds the balance in guaranteeing the secure operation of the power system. \nUsually, power transformers in the operating process are often subject to various factors kinds \nof stresses as electrical, mechanical, chemical, and thermal stress from internal and external \nenvironments. If some accidents happen in the power transformer, it will destroy the normal \nrunning of the power system s, even thorough disruption of  power systems. The power \ntransformer is a complicated structure that involves several parts such as iron core, tap switch, \ncooling system, non-electric quantity protection, winding, bush, and body part [2]. The running \nfailure risk of the power transformer is closely correlated with the risks of the power \ntransformer parts. Through decomposing the power transformer into several parts and \nachieving the quantitative risk assessment and priority evaluation of these parts, one can  \nidentify the weak link of the system and determine the risk factor which does highly affect the \nequipment reliability [3]. The risk priority evaluation of power transformer parts significantly \nenhances the pertinence on transformer repair and maintenance and prevents and reduces \nfailure risk in electricity -management systems. Consequently, the study on risk priority \nevaluation of power transformer parts has essential significance in both theory and practice [4]. \nThe FMEA (failure mode and effect analysis) method, known as one of the most \neffective risk analysis tools, has been widely applied in prioritizing the risk failure modes \n(FMs) in electro-medic industry [5], supply chain system [6], and the chemical industry \n[7]. Diverse disciplines and fields like evidential reasoning method [8], prospect theory [9], \nprobabilistic graphic [10], and logistic regression  [11] have also been performed to boost \nthe development of the theoretical researches on FMEA. As for the  traditional FMEA, \nexperts employ a 1-10 numerical scale to offer the risk priority number (RPN) to measure \nthe risk value and the overall risk prioritization. A large value implies a high -risk degree. \nFor more  details about the FMEA implementation process, one can read [12, 13]. \nNevertheless, the RPN ignores uncertainty when experts present their reference opinions. \nOwing to the uncertain and complex nature of risk, one cannot accurately estimate the risk \npriority evaluation in real life. Plenty of uncertain tools have  been set to overcome the \ndeficiencies of RPN in classical FMEA [14, 15]. The fuzzy technique is one of  the most \nactive and the broadest fields of application research in improving FMEA [16 -18]. \nThe fuzzy technique is a flexible means of representing subjective uncertainty and \nfuzziness w hen experts declare their opinions. With the scholars increasingly focusing \nattention on fuzzy sets (FSs) theory,  there are various types of FSs supporting the \napplicability and convenience of uncertain FMEA for risk  evaluation and prioritization. \nSome famous FSs such as the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) [19], Z -numbers [20], and \nPythagorean fuzzy sets [21] were used in the FMEA successfully, which improved the \nrobustness of the risk analysis procedure. However, there often exist conditions that \nexperts are hesitant to offer a precise risk value. Then, the classical FSs will be inadequate \nand incapable of describing such hesitant  evaluation information. As an expansion of the \ntraditional FSs and IFSs, the hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs)  has several possible me mbership \nvalues, making it more flexible and comprehensive in representing fuzzy information [22]. \nThe HFSs also has the simple mathematical expression form and numerical computation  \n[23]. It has already successfully been used in various decision -making fi elds like green \nsustainable airport design [24], supplier selection [25], and E -learning website evaluation \n[26]. This paper uses the HFSs to  appraise the fuzzy evaluation of risk indicators under \neach FM to better express the complicated vagueness and hesitancy in the risk assessment. \n Risk Priority Evaluation of Power Transformer Parts Based on Hybrid Risk FMEA Framework...  401 \nThe risk assessment in the FMEA framework could be thought of as a multi -criteria \ngroup decision-making (MCGDM) problem [27, 28]. Under the MCGDM term for FMEA, \nthe FMEA experts’ weights and the risk indicators’ weights play crucial roles in deciding \nthe group risk evaluation and the final collective risk values of the FMs. In the FMEA \nteam, the FMEA experts might own different perspectives of the  risk assessments as they \nhave diverse professional backgrounds and specialized s kills. Concerning experts’ \nweights, because the risk analysis process needs to cooperate mutually, the principle of the \nsupport degrees among their opinions provides a new angle for fusing their risk evaluations. \nRegarding the weights of risk indicators, existing objective weighting methods like the entropy \nmethod [9] and the maximizing  deviation method [29] think mostly about the differences \namong the risk indicators. They do not take the possible correlations among risk indicators into \naccount. Hence the objective weighting method that can consider the correlations among risk \nindicators when operating the risk analysis is welcome. Meanwhile, the subjective weights \ncannot be negligible when processing the risk evaluation. As a result, it could be imperative to \nincorporate both subjective and objective weights for FMEA experts and risk indicators to \nachieve a comprehensive risk evaluation result. \nEven though the classical and improved FMEA framework for risk evaluation and \nprioritization have made fruitful ac hievements. As the current risk analysis environment \ngets more complex, FMEA still holds some space for its self -exploitation in mathematical \nmodeling. In summary, the following three research motivations will increase the feasibility \nand practicability of the FMEA problems: \n▪ The precise numerical risky evaluations are unavailable to the FMEA experts. Even \nthough the FSs  have numerous domains to FMEA problems, few studies paid \nattention to the HFSs for FMEA risk  evaluation. It is meaningful to research the \nFMEA disposing of uncertain information under the HFSs environment. \n▪ Despite many successful application fields using the HFSs, there is still a gap in the \ntheoretical research results of the HFSs, especially in dealing with HFSs of different \nlengths. It is beneficial to develop a solution that can not only ensure the integrity of \nthe HFSs but also offer a computational model and some information measures for \nthe HFSs with different lengths. \n▪ Most of the existing FMEA frameworks for risk evaluation support tha t mutual \nindependence exists among the risk indicators. However, there are often some \ncorrelations among risk indicators in actual risk analysis. Thus, it is necessary to \nintegrate the objective weights for risk indicators with the FMEA approach.  \nThis pape r will develop a risk priority evaluation model using a hybrid FMEA \napproach under the HFSs environment, and the main contributions of our paper include: \n▪ The HFSs representation model is an efficient tool for expressing the hesitant fuzzy \nevaluation offered by the FMEA experts. Using the least common multiple rule to deal \nwith HFSs of different lengths and utilizing the novel hesitant fuzzy aggregation \noperators and distance measures for hesitant fuzzy modeling and calculation can enrich \nthe theoretical research results of the HFSs. \n▪ Consider the evaluation similarity between experts and the correlations among risk \nindicators. The novel HFWA operator with the support degree is developed to fuse \nthe individual risk evaluation matrix. Then the novel HFWGA opera tor with \nCRITIC weights is applied to decide the risk priorities of FMs. The subjective and \nobjective combined weights will help get a complete risk evaluation result. \n402 B. ZHOU, J. CHEN, Q. WU, D. PAMUČAR, W. WANG, L. ZHOU  \n \n▪ To illustrate the validity of our proposed novel FMEA methodology, a case study of \nrisk priority evaluation of power transformer parts is provided. Then the comparative \nanalysis with some existing FMEA models is implemented, which also vastly \nguarantees the persuasive power. \nThe rest of our paper is: Some literature is reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 are some \nbasic theoretical concepts about the HFSs, including the definition, new operational laws \nand aggregation operators, and the distance measure. Section 4 constructs a hybrid FMEA \nframework with hesitant fuzzy aggregation tools and combined weights for FMEA experts \nand risk indicators. Section 5 employs the proposed model for the risk prioritization of \npower transformer parts. In Section 6, sensitivity and comparative analyses are performed \nto verify the validity of the proposed model. Some conclusions are drawn in Section 7. \n2. LITERATURE REVIEW \n2.1. FMEA Approach Using FSs Theory  \nFMEA is one of the most powerful tools for analyzing system reliability and safety. \nResearch showed that the FMEA plays a significant role in maintenance manageme nt \nstrategies in risk analysis. With the relentless march of technological progress, the mathematic \nmodel, MCDM approach, and artificial intelligence are adopted more and more when solving \nFMEA problems. The risk priority evaluation involves high complexity and various angles, \nand the FMEA method is proven to be valid to assist experts in making a reasonable decision. \nIn recent years, many scholars have focused on research in the FMEA area using fuzzy \ntechniques and achieved encouraging results [30, 31]. Zhang et al. [32] developed a linguistic \ndistribution opinion evolution-based social network consensus model to help FMEA experts \nreach a consensus. Using an extended COPRAS method to solve the risk evaluation issues and \ndetermine the weights with the Kemeny Median and SWARA methods, Shen and Liu [33] \nproposed a novel risk assessment model in a free double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic \nterm set environment. Jin et al. [34] ranked FMs using interval-valued q-rung orthoptic fuzzy \nsets (IVq -ROFSs). They de veloped a scientific risk evaluation model combining the \nIVq-ROF-deviation maximization method with the IVq -ROF-additive ratio assessment \nmethod. Huang and  Xiao [35] developed a novel improved FMEA framework for risk \nevaluation with a novel concept named the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy clouds. \nThe risk analysis in FMEA is uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. It would be an excellent \nchoice for the experts to use the FSs tools to represent their vagueness in the FMEA execution. \nThis way can preserve information integrity and improve the accuracy of quantitative analyzes. \n2.2. Decision-Making Evaluation Model with HFSs \nDue to the subjective and objective complexity in real -world risk analysis, experts \nwould have difficulties giving their perspectives pre cisely. By contrast, experts often feel \nmore comfortable hesitantly giving their opinions. The HFSs expressed by several possible \nmembership values have proven solid in modeling the fuzzy evaluation. \nIn recent years, many researchers have modelled the unce rtain information using the \nHFSs [36–40]. With the early screening of lung cancer is becoming exceedingly significant \nfor the effective treatment of lung cancer, Liao et al. [36] constructed a framework uses the \ndouble normalization-based multi-aggregation (DNMA) and Delphi methods with HFSs to \n Risk Priority Evaluation of Power Transformer Parts Based on Hybrid Risk FMEA Framework...  403 \nsolve the lung cancer screening problem. Mishra et al. [37] established a hybrid framework \ncontaining the ARAS method and a novel divergence measure for HFSs, to find the best \nantiviral therapy which can be reliable for COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Liao \net al. [38] put forward a Choquet integral -based hesitant fuzzy gained and lost dominance \nscore method considering the interactions among criteria and the experts’ preference \ncharacteristics in MCGDM problems and then applied their model to the higher business  \neducation evaluation. Considering that energy storage  technologies (ESTs) enable coping \nwith the intermittency of energy sources by storing excess energy for  use when needed, \nColak and Kaya [39] establish ed an integrated MCDM model consolidating the Delphi,  \nAHP, and VIKOR methods with HFSs to evaluate ESTs for Turkey. \nAs reviewed beforehand, it is regularly hard for FMEA experts to give their appraisal \nutilizing exact value on a mathematical size of 1-10. Compared with other fuzzy tools, the \nHFSs is more successful in displaying the hesitant uncertainty in real applications. Hence, \nHFSs are applied to manage the ambiguous risk evaluations in this paper.  \n2.3. The Objective CRITIC Weighting Approach \nWhen computing the risk priority of FMs, the final evaluation and ranking are highly \ndependent on the  weights of the risk indicators. The weighting determination methods \nusually incorporate subjective and  objective weighting strategies. The subjective weights \nmainly rely on the expert’s judgments,  which are impacted by the experts’ professional \nknowledge structure and expertise and skills in the related  areas. The objective weighting \ntechnique decides the weights with the given assessment data  by addressing mathematical \nmodels. These objective weights are beneficial in cases where the subjective weights given \nby the experts are inconsistent so that one can achieve more objective results.  \nThe well-known objective CRITIC weighting method was initiated by Diakoulaki et al. [41] \nin 1995. It relies on the analysis of the assessment matrix for collecting all preference \ninformation included in the assessment criteria. The calculation of acquiring the objective \nweight contains the standard deviation of the criteria and the correlation between the criteria. \nCRITIC method has been successfully utilized in accomplishing various decision -making \nscenarios [42–46]. Lai and Liao [42] focused on solving the blockchain platform evaluation \nissues by incorporating linguistic D numbers (LDNs), DNMA method, and CRITIC method. In \ntheir model, the CRITIC technique is combined with the LDN -based DNMA approach to \nmirror the correlations between criteria in the blockchain platform assessment course. As for \nthe sustainable supply chain risk management (SSCRM), to characterize the principal risk \nfactors and rank the business alternatives based on these factors, Abdel-Basset and Mohamed \n[43] developed a joined pathogenic methodology dependent on the TOPSIS-CRITIC strategy \nto gauge the SSCRM factors. Peng and Huang [44] presented a novel q-ROF financial risk \ndecision-making method based on CoCoSo with CRITIC methods. They applied the combined \nweight method based on CRITIC and the linear weighted comprehensive process to \nsimultaneously consider subjective and objective information. Wu et al. [45] offered a practical \nmodel for site determination of photovoltaic hydrogen production project based on the MCDM \nmethod. Their model determines the subjective and objective weights by applying BWM and \nCRITIC, respectively. Then the collective weights are derived by using the game theory. \nThe execution of FMEA is a run of the MCGDM issue, and the weights of both FMEA \nexperts and risk indicators ought to be fundamental components in FMEA. In a MCGDM, \nexperts’ opinions will be supported by each other, and there are often correlations between \n404 B. ZHOU, J. CHEN, Q. WU, D. PAMUČAR, W. WANG, L.

Thus, it is necessary to consider the \nsimilarity measure among FMEA experts and the amount of  information contained in the \nrisk indicators to offer objective weights for real-world FMEA problems. \n3. METHODOLOGY \n3.1. Hesitant Fuzzy Sets \nDefinition 1. [23] Let X be a nonempty set. A HFSs H on X is a function that maps each \nelement of X to a subset of [0,1] such that \n \n{ , ( ) | }H x h x x X=     (1) \nwhere h(x) is a set of possible values in [0,1], denoting the possible membership degrees of \nan element x\n X to the set H.  \nXia and Xu [23] called h(x)={γ1,…,γ#h} a hesitant fuzzy element (HFE), and let Ω be \nthe set of all HFEs.  γ1 (l=1,…,#h) and #h are the possible elements and the elements \nnumber of h, respectively. Without loss of generality, the elements in h(x) are in increasing \norder, and #h is called the length of h.  \nDefinition 2.  [23] For a HFE  h, \n#\n1\n1() #\nh\nllsh h ==   is called the score  function of h. \nFor two HFEs h1 and h2, if s(h1)>s(h2), then h1 is superior to h2, denoted by h1≻h2; if \ns(h1)=s(h2), then h1 is indifferent to h2, denoted by h1~h2. \n3.2. New Operational Laws and Two Novel Aggregation Operators for HFSs \nOne can find that different HFEs may have different lengths, leading to difficulties in \nmaking operations on HFEs. The least common multiple (LCM) rule is widely used in \nnumber th eory and statistics. It gives valuable references and ideas in studying the \nmulti-fuzzy sets. Inspired by [47], the concept of r-HFE is: \nDefinition 3. Let h={γ1,γ2,…,γ#h} be a HFE, and #h be its length, then  hr is a bag (or \nmultiset) with r#h elements in hr such that \n \n1 1 1 2 2 2 # # #{ , ,..., , , ,..., ,..., , ,..., }.r\nh h h\nr times r times r times\nh         =\n  (2) \nExample 1. Let h1={0.2,0.3} and h2={0.5,0.6,0.7} be two HFEs. As the lengths of h1 \nand h2 are different, we use t he proposed LCM principle to normalize the two HFEs. The \nlcm of 2 and 3 is 6, then h\n3 \n1 ={0.2,0.2,0.2,0.3,0.3,0.3} and h\n2 \n2 ={0.5,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.7,0.7}. \nAccording to Theorems 2 -5 in [48], it has shown that some significant information \nmeasures of a  HFE stay u naltered under the LCM rule, so next we propose some new \noperational laws and two novel aggregation operators for HFSs based on the LCM rule \nDefinition 4 . Let h, h1, and h2 be three HFEs, #h, #h1 and #h2 are their lengths, \nrespectively, L=lcm(#h1,#h2), and λ be a real number.

PROPOSED HYBRID FMEA FRAMEWORK FOR RISK ASSESSMENT  \nUNDER HFSS ENVIRONMENT \n4.1. Problem Description \nThe risk evaluation and prioritization in the FMEA framework can be naturally view as \na MCGDM problem, i.e., the m risk failure modes FMi (i=1,2,…,m) are alternatives, the n \nrisk factors Cj (j=1,2,…,n) are criteria, and there are g FMEA experts Ek (k=1,2,…,g) \njoining in the risk evaluation. The criteria and experts’ weighting vectors w=(w1,w2,…,wn)T \nand λ=(λ1,λ2,…,λg)T satisfying wj, λk ≥0, ∑jwj =1 and ∑kλk =1. Let Rk=(r\nk \nij ) m×n (k=1,2,…,g) be \nthe risk evaluation matrix given by Ek (see Table 1), where r\nk \nij  implies the risk value for the \nFMi with respect to criterion Cj offered by expert Ek. \nTable 1 Risk priority evaluation in the FMEA framework based on MCGDM method  \n E1  E2  Eg \n C1 C2 … Cn C1 C2 … Cn … C1 C2 … Cn \nFM1 r\n1 \n11 r\n1 \n12 … r\n1 \n1n r\n2 \n11 r\n2 \n12 … r\n2 \n1n \n  r\ng \n11 r\ng \n12 … r\ng \n1n \nFM2 r\n1 \n21 r\n1 \n22 … r\n1 \n2n r\n2 \n21 r\n2 \n22 … r\n2 \n2n \n  r\ng \n21 r\ng \n22 … r\ng \n2n \n… … … … … … … … … … … … … … \nFMm r\n1 \nm1 r\n1 \nm2 … r\n1 \nmn r\n2 \nm1 r\n2 \nm2 … r\n2 \nmn \n  r\ng \nm1 r\ng \nm2 … r\ng \nmn \nThe hybrid FMEA framework under the HFSs environment with the MCGDM \ntechnique contains three major stages (also see the flowchart exhibited in Fig. 1): \n1. Risk evaluation of each FM: The HFSs are utilized to represent the risk evaluation. \n2. Aggregation of the individual risk evaluation: The new HFWA operator with \ncombined weights is utilized to fuse the individual risk evaluation matrix. \n3. Risk prioritization of each FM: The novel HFWGA operator with the CRITIC \nweights is applied to determine the risk priorities of FMs. \n Risk Priority Evaluation of Power Transformer Parts Based on Hybrid Risk FMEA Framework...  407 \n \nFig. 1 The flow chart of the proposed decision-making process \n4.2. Risk Evaluation Procedure \nStep 2.1: Determine all the potential FMs \nFirst, invite the FMEA experts to carry on the discussion on the risk analysis. According \nto the expertise and experience of the FMEA experts, different experts can complement each \nother with their advantages to identify and determine all the potential FMs. \nStep 2.2: Form the hesitant fuzzy risk evaluation matrix \nAfter identifying and selecting all the potential FMs, each FMEA expert is asked to \noffer their opinions on the risk levels towards the risk indi cators O, S, D using several \npossible membership values concerning the linguistic term ‘Very high’. Then, all the \nhesitant fuzzy risk values of FMi on risk indicator Cj offered by expert Ek can be recorded \nas r\nk \nij (i=1,…,m;j=1,…,n;k=1,…,g). Finally, all the r\nk \nij values form g decision matrix Rk=(r\nk \nij)m×n \n(k=1,2,…,g) corresponding to the FMEA expert Ek (k=1,2,…,g). \n408 B. ZHOU, J. CHEN, Q. WU, D. PAMUČAR, W. WANG, L. ZHOU  \n \n4.3. Risk Evaluation Information Aggregation \nWhen it comes to aggregating the group risk evaluation information, in most existing \nFMEA analyses, the weights of FMEA experts are often subjectively given in advance. \nHowever, this will lead to the collective risk evaluation being more dependent on experts \nwith larger weights. Using objective weights for FMEA experts, on the one hand, can \neliminate the extreme aggregation mode and, on the other hand, may also achieve more \nobjective aggregation results. Based on the subjective trust relationship and the objective \nsimilarity measure, we propose a combined weighting method to determine the weights of \nFMEA experts. Then, we employ the newly developed HFWA operator to fuse the \nindividual risk evaluation information under HFSs environment. \nStep 3.1: Compute the support degree among the risk evaluation values \nAs for the risk values r\nk \nij  representing FMi on risk indicator Cj offered by FMEA expert \nEk, if it is close to the risk evaluation r\nk’ \nij (k’≠k) given by the other FMEA experts, then it \nshould have higher support degree. Specifically, the support degree between r\nk \nij  and r\nk’ \nij\n(k’≠k) can be formulated as: \n \nsup( , ) 1 ( , ).k k k k\nij ij ij ijr r d r r\n\n=−  (8) \nObviously, when d(r\nk \nij ,r\nk’ \nij )=0, meaning that expert Ek and expert Ek’ have the same \nevaluation result concerning the FMi on risk indicator Cj. They give the largest mutual \nsupport to each other. Then, the support degree between r\nk \nij and all the others experts is \n \n( , )1sup( ) sup( , ) 1 .11\nkk\nij ij\nk k k kk\nij ij ij\nkk\nd r r\nr r r gg\n \n\n= = −−−\n\n  (9) \nStep 3.2: Calculate the weight of expert Ek concerning the FMi on risk indicator Cj \nBased on the support degrees defined in Eqs. (8) and (9), the weight of expert Ek \ntowards the FMi on risk indicator Cj can be obtained directly by using each sup(r\nk \nij ) divide \nthe sum of sup(r\nk \nij ) such that \n \nsup( , ) 1 ( , )sup( ) .sup( ) sup( , ) ( 1) ( , )\nk k k k\nk ij ij ij ij\nijk k k k k\nij k k k k k\nij ij ij ij ij\nk k k k k k k\nr r g d r rr\nr r r k g d r r\n\n\n\n\n−−\n= = = −−\n\n    (10) \nSo an objective weight can be set for each FMEA expert. Assume the subjective \nweighting vector for the experts is λ=(λ1,λ2,…,λg)T. Consequently, the combined weight for \nexpert Ek is \n \n(1 ) ,kk\nij ij k   = + −\n  (11) \nwhere α is a balancing parameter between the objective weight and subjective weight. \nStep 3.3: Form the group risk evaluation matrix \nApplying the weights derived in Step 3.2, the group risk evaluation matrix Rc=(r\nc \nij)m×n \ncan be computed by using the new HFWA operator such that \n \n/#12\n( ) ( )1,2,..., 1\n( , ,..., ) 1 (1 ) | ( ) ,\nkk\nij ij ij\nij ij\nij ij\ng\nLrc g k k k\nij ij ij ij l l ij lL k\nr HFWA r r r r\n\n   \n= =\n= = − −  \n \n  (12) \nwhere Lij is the LCM of #r\nk \nij  (k=1,2,…,g). \n Risk Priority Evaluation of Power Transformer Parts Based on Hybrid Risk FMEA Framework...  409 \n4.4. Risk Priority Calculation \nThe conventional FMEA method often sets the equal weight or the subjective known \nweights for the risk indicators. They cannot tackle the issue with risk indicators interaction \nand unknown weights. CRITIC is one of the most effective MCDM methods that spotlights \nthe objective criteria weight. This method determines the objective weight dependent on \ntwo elements of data, including the distinctions and correlations among various criteria all \nthe while. The first is the contrast intensity  using the standard deviation to illustrate each \ncriterion separately. The second dimension is the conflict  between criteria, the line ar \ncorrelation coefficient between criteria measures the conflict. To solve the risky preference \nindicated by HFSs, we investigate this strategy in the HFSs environment as:  \nStep 4.1: Decide the objective weights of the risk indicators: CRITIC method \nAs for group risk evaluation matrix Rc=(r\nc \nij)m×n derived in Section 4.3, compute the score s\nc \nij \nof each hesitant fuzzy risk evaluation value r\nc \nij, then we form a score matrix Sc=(s\nc \nij) m×n as \n \n11 12 1\n21 22 2\n12\n.\nc c c\nn\nc c c\nc n\nc c c\nm m mn mn\ns s s\ns s sS\ns s s \n\n\n=\n\n  (13) \nThe standard deviation σj of the jth criteri on, which is used to measure the contrast \nintensities of criteria and can be calculated by \n \n11\n()\nwith .\nmm\nc c c\nij j ij\ncii\njj\ns s s\nsmm ==\n−\n==\n  (14) \nThe correlation coefficient between the jth and lth criteria, which is used to measure the \nconflicts between criteria is calculated as \n \n1\n22\n11\n( )( )\n.\n( ) ( )\nm\nc c c c\nij j il l\ni\njl mm\nc c c c\nij j il l\nii\ns s s s\ns s s s\n =\n==\n−−\n=\n−−\n\n  (15) \nThe quantity of information qj contained in the criterion Cj is computed as \n \n1\n(1 ).\nn\nj j jl\nl\nq \n=\n=−   (16) \nThen the objective weighting vector of the risk indicators can be derived as \n \n.\njO\nj\nj\nj\nqw q=\n  (17) \nSo an objective weight can be set for each risk indicator.

They are denoted by FMi \n(i=1,…,7). Fig. 2 gives the statistical failure data of power transformers parts of on e \nspecific region in the past 10 years.

Calculate the Risk Priorities of FMs \nRegarding the group risk evaluation matrix Table 8, we first utilize the CRITIC \nweighting method to derive the objective weights. Based on the score of HFSs and Eq. (14), \nthe standard deviation of each risk indicator can be calcul ated as σ1=0.0932, σ2=0.1833, \nσ3=0.1666. Using Eq. (15), one can obtain the correlation coefficient matrix ρ=(ρjl)3×3 \namong the risk indicators. Then, by using Eqs. (16) and (17), the quantity of information \ncontained in each risk indicator and the objective weigh ts of the risk indicators can be \nderived as q1=0.9016, q2=0.6685, q3=0.8785 and w\nO \n1 =0.2380, w\nO \n2 =0.3472, w\nO \n3 =0.4147. \nCombining with the equal weights of the conventional FMEA model and using Eq. (18) \nwith β=0.5 (implying the equal importance between the objective and subjective weights). \nThen the combined weights for risk indicators are w1=0.2857, w2=0.3403, w3=0.3740. \nTable 9 The global hesitant fuzzy risk evaluation of each FM  \n Global hesitant fuzzy risk evaluation Score Ranking \nFM1 {0.6289,0.6289,0.6439,0.7190,0.7338,0.7338} 0.681 1 \nFM2 {0.4882,0.4882,0.5103,0.5873,0.6242,0.6242} 0.554 2 \nFM3 {0.3286,0.3286,0.3507,0.4336,0.4461,0.4461} 0.387 5 \nFM4 {0.3675.0.3675.0.4073.0.4798.0.5229.0.5229} 0.445  3 \nFM5 {0.3886,0.3886,0.4227,0.4623,0.4974,0.4974} 0.443  4 \nFM6 {0.2948,0.2948,0.3051,0.3802,0.3914,0.3914} 0.343  6  \nFM7 {0.2210,0.2210,0.2534,0.3146,0.3483,0.3483} 0.284 7 \nFinally, based on Eq. (19), one can obtain the global hesitant fuzzy risk evaluation of \neach FM as shown in Table 9. Based on the score of global hesitant fuzzy risk value of each \nFM, then the risk priority ranking order are determined also shown in Table 9.  \nAs a result, we can now rank the FMs in light of the scores values, and the risk priority \nranking of all the FMs is FM1≻FM2≻FM4≻FM5≻FM3≻FM6≻FM7. Apparently, FM1 \nwinding owns the highest risk level, which deserves the greatest attention.  \n6. DISCUSSIONS \n6.1. Sensitivity Analysis \nNext, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the effect of the related parameters \nin our model on the risk calculation and rankings. α and β indicate the importance degree of \nthe objective weights on experts and risk indicators, respectively. Larger α and β imply a \nlarger preference towards the objective weights. Here, α and β are from 0 to 1 t o analyze \nthe sensitivity. The fixed α and β are α=β=0.5. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 indicate how different \nsingle α and β affects the final score values of the 7 FMs, respectively. \nOne can see from Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, changing a single parameter will affect the fin al \nscore values of FMs. The parameters α and β play certain roles in deciding the combined \nweights for the experts and the risk indicators and then affecting the final score values of \nFMs. Specifically, the scores of FMs decrease monotonically with the increase of β, but the \ntrends of the scores of FMs are not the same with α increases. These are mainly because the \nparameter β directly affects the global weights of the risk indicators, while the parameter α \nonly impacts the local weights of the experts. Fur thermore, one can draw the following \nconclusions based on Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. \n414 B. ZHOU, J. CHEN, Q. WU, D. PAMUČAR, W. WANG, L. ZHOU  \n \n \nFig. 3 Variation of the score values of the FMs with different α \n \nFig. 4 Variation of the score values of the FMs with different β \n▪ The effect on the final score values of FMs o f α is less than that of β. The score \nvalues present a stable status as the single parameter α changes, while the score \nvalues decrease with an extensive variation range when a single parameter β \nchanges. In essence, the objective weights for risk indicato rs have more influence \non the final score values than the objective weights for experts. \n Risk Priority Evaluation of Power Transformer Parts Based on Hybrid Risk FMEA Framework...  415 \n▪ Changing either single α and β will make a different ranking for the FMs, especially \nfor FM4 and FM5. The ranking of FM5 increases with the increase of α, and the \nranking of FM4 increases with the rise of β. Although the other FMs’ ranking stays \nthe same, these dynamic changes cannot be negligible since they directly relate to \nthe maintenance and inspection costs. \n▪ The final score values affected by the two combined weig hting methods with two \nparameters α and β can constitute a three -dimensional variation pattern. Here are \ntwo two-dimensional images that present the changing trend of final score values to \nfacilitate sensitivity analysis directly. \nAccording to the above ca lculations and analysis, it is apparent that the combined \nweights for risk assessment are flexible and easy to operate, and experts can select suitable \nparameter values to control the balance between the objective and subjective weights. Due \nto the natural uncertainty and complexity in risk analysis, taking these factors into account \nis necessary and meaningful. \n6.2. Comparative Analysis \nTo verify the effectiveness of our hybrid FMEA framework for risk assessment, this \nsection we compare our method with some  existing FMEA models under the same case \nstudy. These comparative methods contain the classical RPN method [49], the HF-VIKOR \nmethod [50], the HF-TOPSIS method [51], and the generalized TODIM method [52]. \nSpecifically, we first transform the HFSs into precise numerical values in [0,10] based \non their scores, and then we utilize the classical FMEA method [49] to determine the RPN \nof each FM. Next, according  to the distance measure between the HFSs [53] and the \nobjective weights for risk indicators using the maximizing deviation method, we apply the \nHF-VIKOR [50], and HF -TOPSIS [51] to derive the compromise solution and the \ncloseness coefficient of each FM, respectively. Finally, the generalized TODIM  method \n[52] is extended into the hesitant fuzzy environment, and an extended generalized TODIM \nis developed for the risk prioritization. \nTable 10 The comparisons of different methods \n Classical RPN [49] HF-VIKOR [50] HF-TOPSIS [51] Generalized TODIM [52] \n RPN Order Si Ri Qi Order D\n- \ni   D\n+ \ni  CCIi Order πi Order \nFM1 299.78  1 0.139  0.074  0.106  1 0.078  0.497  0.864  1 1 1 \nFM2 134.35  2 0.354  0.221  0.287  2 0.163  0.417  0.719  2 0.803 2 \nFM3 47.19  5  0.645  0.272  0.459  5 0.328  0.240  0.423 5 0.346 5 \nFM4 80.48  3  0.551  0.241  0.396 4 0.283  0.291  0.507  4 0.526 3 \nFM5 71.73  4  0.521  0.255 0.388  3 0.269  0.304  0.530  3 0.477 4 \nFM6 38.00  6  0.736 0.301  0.518  6 0.394  0.171  0.302  6 0.179 6 \nFM7 22.27 7 0.856  0.320  0.588  7 0.480  0.100  0.172  7 0 7 \nThe computed target values and th e corresponding ranking orders of the FMs’ risk \nprioritization gained by these methods are listed in Table 10. From Table 10, one can find \nsome ponderable results. \n▪ First, FM1 always has the highest level of risk priority, and FM7 always has the lowest \nrisk priority in all the five risk evaluation methods. The most crucial and least severe \nFMs are always the same under the five risk evaluation methods. This result coincides \nwith the fault statistics of transformer parts concerning FM1 and FM7 shown in Fig. 2. \n416 B. ZHOU, J. CHEN, Q. WU, D. PAMUČAR, W. WANG, L. ZHOU  \n \n▪ Second, our risk priority ranking results of FMs are consistent with the classical RPN \nmethod and the generalized TODIM method for FMEA, which reveal a relatively high \nhomogeneity between our proposed FMEA approach and the other two methods. This \nalso implies that our proposed hybrid FMEA framework for risk assessment is valid to \nevaluate and rank the risk prioritization of FMs. \n▪ Finally, regarding the HF-VIKOR and HF-TOPSIS methods, FM5 has a higher risk \npriority than FM4, which is opposite with our approach and the other two methods. But \non the whole, there are slight differences between the overall risk values of FM5 and \nFM4. The different decision-making mechanisms cause the ranking difference. \nMore specifically, compared with the above four comparative  models, our method has \nthe following differences and advantages: \n▪ First, the classical FMEA [49] is based on the RPN method that employs precise values \nas the risk evaluation information and treats the risk indicators as equally important. \nCompared with the classical FMEA method, our proposed hybrid FMEA model can \nsuccessfully deal with uncertainty representation (HFSs), uncertain information fusion \n(hesitant fuzzy aggregation techniques), and combined weights effects (combined \nweighting method). The propos ed FMEA  framework for risk analysis is more \ncomprehensive and objective. \n▪ Second, the HF-VIKOR [50], and HF-TOPSIS [51] methods for FMEA are based on \nthe reference level models. The selection of the reference points has a strong influence \non the final risk evaluation results. Our FMEA model directly fuses the risk evaluation, \nand it has a different decision-making mechanism with them. The maximizing deviation \nmethod is used to derive the objective weights for risk indicators. It is based on the \ncontrast intensity of each risk indicator and does not consider the correlations between \nrisk indicators. Hence, our hybrid FMEA model is more straightforward and produces \nmore flexible weights, creating more objective and practical risk analysis results.  \n▪ Third, the g eneralized TODIM method for FMEA [52] is based on the dominant \ncomparative model, and it can consider several parameters and embody diverse experts’ \nrisk attitudes. Nevertheless, certain limitations of this method will exist concerning the \nselection of related parameters in practice. Our model produces consistent results with \nthe generalized TODIM model. Still, the parameters in our combined weights are more \nacceptable, and the decision-making mechanism also corresponds with the multiplicative \nproperty of the classical FMEA. \nBy providing a novel hybrid FMEA framework integrating the hesitant fuzzy aggregation \ntechnique with the combined weights approach, the developed FMEA model is forthright and \nflexible in handling risk assessments issues containing multiple experts and risk indicators. The \ncombined weights help cover the  group experts’ consensus and correlations between risk \nindicators. It is more reasonable and practicable than the FMEA models that direct aggregate \nindividual risk evaluation information and assume that the risk indicators are independent of \neach other in practical risk analysis. \n7. CONCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE STUDIES \nThe FMEA approach served as a practical risk analysis framework is widely adopted in \nrisk assessment and management with remarkable results. With the increasing complexity \nof the engineering system, the uncertain tool is also being accepted by many experts when \n Risk Priority Evaluation of Power Transformer Parts Based on Hybrid Risk FMEA Framework...  417 \nthey express their risk evaluations. The HFSs  has been a very efficient representation \nmodel to describe the hesitant and fuzzy assessments. This paper develops a hybrid FMEA \nframework for risk evaluation and prioritization with a novel hesitant fuzzy computational \nmodel and CRITIC weighting method. Our model efficaciously and  comprehensively \ndeals with informati on representation, information fusion, and risk evaluation. The  novel \nhesitant fuzzy computational representation model can enrich the theoretical research \nresults of the HFSs. The combined weights can obtain a more accurate result as it considers \nboth the support degrees among experts and the subjective  power of FMEA experts. The \nHFWGA operator with CRITIC weights can nicely satisfy the multiplicative property of \nthe classical FMEA model and consider the correlations between risk indicators. Finally, \nthe risk priority evaluation of power transformer parts with sensitivity  and comparative \nanalyses reveals that our model is efficient in providing risk analysis support. \nThis paper has vital significance in theory and practical risk analysis. However, our \nmodel still has deficiencies, which point the way for future study. First, the risk indicators \nused to evaluate the FMs  might remain inadequate. In the FMEA framework, only three \nrisk indicators are considered.  More aspects and risk indicators should help impro ve the \nrisk assessment’s comprehensiveness. Second, two common aggregation tools, including \nthe weighted averaging and geometric weighted  averaging operators, are utilized to fuse \nthe hesitant fuzzy evaluation information. Some more advanced  aggregation te chniques \nsuch as the Choquet average operator [54] and geometric Bonferroni mean [55] can also  \nimprove the interactive effect of the interaction relationships among risk factors. Finally, \nalthough the CRITIC weighting method can determine objective weights  considering the \ndifferences and correlations  among various risk indicators simultaneously, the inherent \nrelation between the risk indicators is worthy of further investigation and exploitation. \nThe research results offer a reference for the FMEA and risk assessment. One can get a \nreasonable risk prioritization if the decision process is implemented correctly. The hesitant \nfuzzy aggregation technique  is involved in these two stages to fuse the individual risk \nevaluation matrix and decide the total risk valu e. Some MCDM methods like the VIKOR \n[56] and the generalized TODIM [57] can also be used in the  second stage. The proposed \nFMEA model uses HFSs as the evaluation representations. Some other uncertain or fuzzy \ntechniques [58, 59] will also be feasible when expressing subjective uncertainties. Finally, the \nproposed FMEA model is applied to the risk prioritization of the power transformer parts. In \nother areas like the logistics management [60], sustainable vehicle facilities [61], emergency \nsituation [62], and railway management [63, 64], the application will also be beneficial. \nAcknowledgement: The work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China \n(Nos. 72101004, 72171002), Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province for Higher Education \nInstitutions (KJ2021A1574), Scholarship from China Scholarship Council (202106090193), Natural \nScience Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Anhui Province (1908085J03).  \nREFERENCES  \n1.
