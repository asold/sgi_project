    "abstract": "Transformer failures are mostly due to partial discharges (PDs) caused by the deteriorated insulation. It is, therefore, important to monitor PD occurrence in insulation system and prevent their deterioration. The presented paper deals with a PD detection method by a capacitive probe, which easily apply to cast - resin dry - type transformers. The PD detection system consists of a capacitive probe and a low noise amplifier having the frequency bandwidth of 500 <TEX>$Hz{\\sim}30$</TEX> MHz. In the experimental set-up, sensitivity of the system is 7.16 mV/pC.",
