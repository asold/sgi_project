However, directional couplers have limited\nbandwidths and their characteristics are highly sensitive to\nfabrication imperfections [9]. Multimode interference (MMI)\ncouplers also have limited bandwidths and non-negligible inser-\ntion losses. It has been reported that bandwidths of directional\ncouplers and MMI couplers can be widened by utilizing struc-\ntures such as curved waveguides, asymmetric waveguides, and\nsubwavelength gratings (SWGs) [10]–[13]. However, they have\nhigh insertion losses and low fabrication tolerances. Whereas\ndirectional couplers and MMI couplers rely on mode beating\nbetween their supermodes or multimodes, adiabatic couplers are\nbased on adiabatic mode evolution offering superior fabrication\ntolerances, and wide bandwidths [14]. However, they typically\nrequire long device lengths for their adiabatic mode evolution.\nSWG-based compact adiabatic couplers have been proposed and\nexperimentally demonstrated [15], [16]. However, they have\nfeatures smaller than 100 nm which make them difﬁcult to\nbe fabricated in typical silicon photonic foundries. It has been\nreported that adiabatic coupler designs having reduced lengths\nbased on optimizing the proﬁles of waveguide widths [17], [18].\nThere are adiabatic coupler designs that optimize not only width\nproﬁles but also gap proﬁles, however, they either have small\nfeature sizes [19], [20] (e.g., 100 nm) or still have a long coupling\nlength [21].\nIn this paper, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated\na compact 2 × 2 3-dB adiabatic coupler based on the shortest\nmode transformer method [22] on a 220-nm silicon-on-insulator\n(SOI) platform. The coupling and total lengths of the proposed\ndevice are 23.2 μm and 46.7 μm, respectively, with the minimum\nfeature size of 200 nm. The demonstrated device exhibits a\nsplitting ratio of 3 ±0.3 dB and an excess loss (EL) of 0.23 dB\nover the wavelength range of 1485-1620 nm. To the best of our\nknowledge, our coupler has the shortest length to date among\nthe adiabatic couplers with a minimum feature size of 200 nm.\nIn addition, our coupler is still shorter than most adiabatic\ncouplers with a minimum feature size of 100 nm except for Ref.\n[20]. This compact size can be achieved with the optimized gap\nproﬁle as well as the optimized waveguide width proﬁle.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

D ESIGN AND SIMULATION RESULT\nThe device was designed for a SOI platform having a 220 nm-\nthick silicon layer and 110 nm-deep partial etch depth for a trans-\nverse electric (TE) mode operation. Fig. 1 shows the schematic\ndiagram of the proposed device consisting of ﬁve regions. For\nRegions 1 and 5, we utilize conventional S-bends where the\ngaps are varied from 1.5 μm to 640 nm, and from 200 nm to\n1.5 μm, respectively. In Region 2, the gap spacing between the\ntwo waveguides is adiabatically reduced from 640 nm to 200 nm\nwhile the widths of the waveguides are ﬁxed. In Region 3, the\nwidth of the upper waveguide (WG1) is adiabatically tapered\ndown while the width of the lower waveguide (WG2) remains\nconstant. The shortest adiabatic mode transformer method [22]\nwas applied to design Regions 2 and 3. Region 4 is the straight\nsection for stabilizing an optical mode after power is evenly\nsplit into the two waveguides. In order to have an adiabatic mode\nevolution in a 3-dB coupler, γ(≡ δ(z)\nκ(z) ) should be varied from /221e\nFig. 3.

There are two supermodes (i.e., even and odd) in the\nFig. 6. Simulated proﬁle of the E-ﬁeld propagating along the coupler which\nshows an even power splitting ratio. Light is inserted into I1.\ncoupled waveguide system, and the presence of only one mode\nis desired while suppressing the excitation of the other mode\nfor ideal adiabatic operation. According to the adiabatic mode\ntransformer method [22], the shortest length can be obtained by\nhaving a proﬁle of γ that satisﬁes the following equation\nγ (z)= u(z)√\n1 −u(z)2\n, (1)\nWhere u(z) ≡ 2√ε∫zl\nz κ(z′)dz′ (0 <z<z l), zl is the phase\nmatching point (i.e., γ (zl)= 0 ), and εis the amount of power\nfraction excited in the unwanted mode. As the device length is\ninversely proportional to κ from Eq. (1), κ should be designed\nas large as possible by narrowing the width of the waveguides\nor by narrowing the gap between the waveguides to realize a\nshort 3-dB adiabatic coupler. However, it is not possible to\nreduce the gap below a resolution limit of lithography tools.\nTherefore, we keep the gap to be ≥ 200 nm, which is readily\nacceptable in typical silicon photonic foundries. In addition, the\nwidths of the waveguides are preferred to be reasonably wide to\navoid excessive scattering losses. Therefore, we set the minimum\nwaveguide widths to be 400 nm, which has acceptable scattering\nloss (<1 dB/cm) [23]. As shown in Fig. 2, the TE 0 mode of WG2\nis coupled with the TE 1 mode of WG1 when the width of the\nupper waveguide is greater than 600 nm. In this case, light can\nbe leaked to TE 1 mode of WG1 when light is inserted to WG2\n(I2). Therefore, we limit the width of WG1 to be ≤ 550 nm.\nIn summary, we deﬁned the following constraints in addition\nto Eq. (1) on our coupler design.\nConstraint 1. For WG1, 400 nm ≤ width ≤ 550 nm.\nConstraint 2. For WG2, width = 400 nm.\nConstraint 3. Gap ≥ 200 nm.\nWith the constraints summarized above, the proﬁle of γalong\nthe z-direction has been found by iteratively solving Eq. (1) from\nz = zl to z =0 while the value of γ was swept from 0 to 10\n(For a realistic implementation, we set the maximum value of γ\nto 10 instead of /221e.). The width of WG2 across the coupler was\nﬁxed at 400 nm (Constraint 2). We started the design by setting\nthe width of WG1 to be 400 nm and the gap to be 200 nm at the\nend of Region 3 ( z = zl ). We then calculated the proﬁle of γ\nalong the negative z-direction by solving Eq. (1) until the width\n6601106 IEEE PHOTONICS JOURNAL, VOL. 13, NO. 4, AUGUST 2021\nFig. 7.

SEM image of the fabricated 2 × 23-dB adiabatic coupler.\nof the upper waveguide reaches 550 nm ( z = zg , beginning of\nRegion 3). Here, the width of the waveguide is determined by the\nrelationship δ(z) ≡ β2−β1\n2 .I nR e g i o n3( zg <z<z l), the gap\nwas ﬁxed to be 200 nm (Constraint 3) for a large κ. Beyond z<\nzg, we could not taper out the width of WG1 due to Constraint\n1. Therefore, we calculate the proﬁle of γ while varying the gap\n(and therefore κ) until γ reaches 10 at the beginning of Region\n2( z = 0). The calculated proﬁle of γ for 0 <z<z l is shown in\nFig. 3(a). It is plotted as a function of a normalized coordinate\nz/zl. The corresponding proﬁles of the gap and the widths are\nplotted in Fig. 3(b) and (c), respectively.\nFor the case when the input light is inserted into I1 (I2),\nwe want to excite only the even (odd) mode. According to\nEq. (1), the fraction of power, ε, coupled into the odd (even)\nmode is inversely proportional to the length of the coupler. The\nexistence of the power fraction in the unwanted mode causes\nmode beating, which results in power oscillation between the\nwaveguides. In order to ﬁnd the length, zl, having sufﬁciently\nlow power oscillation, the transmission characteristics of the\ncoupler is calculated versus the length while maintaining the\nγ proﬁle in Fig. 3(a), using an eigenmode expansion (EME)\nsolver. Fig. 4 clearly shows that the transmissions of the both\noutput ports converged to 3 dB with a reasonably small power\noscillation ( <0.2 dB) when the length is longer than 20 μm.\nTherefore, we designed the length to be 23.2 μm, and the\ncorresponding lengths for Regions 2 and 3 are 7.2 μm and 16 μm,\nrespectively. We also veriﬁed the device characteristics by using\nFDTD simulations. As shown in Fig. 5, the designed coupler\nexhibits a 3-dB power splitting with an imbalance of less than\n± 0.18 dB and an EL of less than 0.1 dB over the wavelength\nrange from 1485 to 1620 nm. Fig. 6 shows the simulated proﬁle\nof the E-ﬁeld intensity when light is inserted into I1.\nIII.

The hard\nmask layer was patterned by a photolithography step with a\nKrF scanner followed by a dry etching process. Subsequently,\nrib waveguides were patterned by a 110-nm-deep silicon etch-\ning. Then, a second lithography step was done followed by\na 220-nm-deep silicon etching. Finally, the remaining hard\nmask was removed via hydrogen ﬂuoride wet etching. Fig. 7\nand Fig. 8 show the optical microscope images and scanning\nelectron microscope (SEM) images of the fabricated devices.\nFor the device characterization, a 127- μm pitch 48-channel\npolarization-maintaining (PM) ﬁber array was used for con-\nsistent ﬁber-to-chip coupling. TE-polarized light was coupled\nthrough vertical grating couplers. The coupling efﬁciency of the\ngrating couplers was measured to be 6 dB/unit in a back-to-back\ngrating coupler pair on the same chip.\nThe power splitting ratio was characterized using the\nunbalanced MZI shown in Fig. 7(a). Rib waveguides with a\nwidth of 500 nm and a partial etch depth of 110 nm were em-\nployed for the two arms of the MZI, and their length difference\nwas designed to be 208 μm. The measured spectral responses\nof the device are shown in Fig. 9. When light was inserted\nat the ﬁrst input (I1), the device exhibited an extinction ratio\nlarger than 25 dB over the wavelength range of 1485–1620 nm,\ncorresponding to a power splitting ratio of 3 ± 0.25 dB. When\nlight was inserted at the second input (I2), the extinction ratio\nwas measured to be 23 dB over the same wavelength range,\ncorresponding to a power splitting ratio of 3 ± 0.3 dB. For the\nreduced wavelength range of 1500–1540 nm, we observed a\nhigh extinction ratio that exceeded 30 dB, which corresponds\nto a splitting ratio of 3 ± 0.13 dB. The slight oscillation of\npower splitting ratio is caused by unwanted mode scattering that\noccurred before light is inserted to the Region2. This oscillation\ncan be reduced by increasing the initial gap, which is currently\ndesigned to be 640 nm in the device. For the EL measurement,\nwe measured the output transmissions of a cascaded structure\nof 16-stage 3-dB couplers. Subsequently, the EL of a single\n3-dB coupler was calculated by dividing the total EL of the\ncascaded structure by the number of the stage. Fig. 10 shows the\nmeasured EL of the 3-dB coupler. We observed ELs less than\n0.23 dB and 0.17 dB over the wavelength range of 1485–1620 nm\nfor light insertions into I1 and I2, respectively. The EL can be\nreduced by employing more gradual waveguide bending at the\nRegion1/Region2 interface.\nTable I shows a summary of state-of-the-art 2 × 23-dB\nadiabatic couplers reported to date.

C ONCLUSION\nWe have experimentally demonstrated a high-performance\nand compact 2 × 2 silicon photonic 3-dB adiabatic coupler\nbased on the shortest mode transformer method. Using the\nmethod thereof, the coupling length of the adiabatic coupler\ncan be reduced to a compact size of 23 μm with a relaxed CD\nof 200 nm, which can be readily acceptable in existing silicon\nphotonics foundries. To the best of our knowledge, our coupler\nhas the shortest length to date among the adiabatic couplers with\na minimum feature size of 200 nm. In addition, our coupler is\nstill shorter than most adiabatic couplers with a minimum feature\nsize of 100 nm except for Ref. [20]. Furthermore, the coupler\nindicated good performances, i.e., <± 0.3 dB oscillation and\n<0.23 dB EL in a broad wavelength range of 1485–1620 nm.\nMoreover, the oscillation of the power splitting ratio is reduced\nto ±0.13 dB in the reduced wavelength range of 1500–1540 nm.\nOur design methodology can be applied to variety of photonic\ndevices based on adiabatic couplers such as Y-splitter, photonic\nswitches, mode division multiplexers, and inversely-tapered\nedge couplers for highly integrated photonic circuits.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors thank Dr. Jong-Bum You for the discussions\nregarding the fabrication process at the National Nanofab Center\nin Republic of Korea.\nREFERENCES\n[1] R.
