INTRODUCTION\nThe transformer, as the basic equipment for power trans-\nmission and transformation, is widely used in power plants,\nconverter stations, and substations. It occupies a pivotal posi-\ntion in the power industry and is also the basic components\nfor industrial transformation. Its demand is increasing with\neach passing day, and the market prospect is very broad. The\nwinding machine is one of the key equipment in transformer\nproduction. With the development of automatic winding tech-\nnology, an automatic winding machine with high efﬁciency,\nlow production cost, compact coil, and high ﬁlling coefﬁcient\nhas been widely used in transformer production [1], [2].\nCoil winding is the core process of transformer manufac-\nturing, which not only determines the mechanical, insulation,\nand heat resistance performance of the transformer but also\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Padmanabh Thakur\n.\naffects the economic indicators of the transformer [3]. It is\nnecessary to add an insulation layer between the winding\nlayers to ensure the insulation performance of the trans-\nformer and reduce the risk of voltage ﬂashover of adjacent\nwinding layers. The traditional placement of transformer\ninterlayer insulation requires workers to cut the surface\ninsulation according to the size of the transformer core and\nthen cover the wide paper sheet on the winding surface. The\nplacement of end insulation is that workers stick the thick\ninsulation strips stacked by multiple layers to both ends of\nthe transformer core mold. As shown in Fig 1 (a), the tension\ncontrol in the winding process depends on the experience\nand proﬁciency of workers. The insulation layer is the part\nthat consumes the longest working time and has the lowest\nefﬁciency in the winding process of the transformer.\nUsing the idea of continuous winding of thin strip insu-\nlation tape instead of wide strip insulation layer covering,\nthe automatic insulation layer winding system of transformer\n95068 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

(c) Gradient winding.\nwinding machine can solve the complicated labor of workers,\nand the equal-spacing and gradient winding of insulation\ntape can be realized in the winding process [4], as shown\nin Fig 1 (b) and (c). The core technology of insulation tape\ntension control in the winding process mainly depends on\nthe design of the tension control system. In order to improve\nand enhance the performance of the tension control system,\nresearchers have done much in-depth research. Industrial\ntension control systems usually use PI controllers with ﬁxed\ngains [5]–[7]. This requires setting the gain according to\nthe working environment and material parameters. Due to\nchanges in operating conditions and web parameters, and\nuncertainty in the system, leading to this is a difﬁcult task.\nThe ﬁxed PI gain cannot well meet the changing needs of\nthe system state and even cause the system to be unstable\nin some cases. T Nishida et al.constructed a self-correcting\nPI controller with an estimator based on an adaptive particle\nswarm algorithm [8]. Pramod R et al. used model-based\nreference and relay feedback methods to design adaptive\nPI controllers [9]. In order to effectively reduce and com-\npensate for the tension disturbance existing in the system,\nS H Liu et al. designed an auto-disturbance-rejection con-\ntroller to improve the stability of the system [10]. As the\nspeed difference between the two axes can cause obvious\ntension disturbances in the system, to reduce the synchro-\nnization speed error between the two axial systems, aim-\ning at the uncertain model of transformer winding system,\nVan Tu Duong et al.proposed a cross-coupling synchronous\nspeed control method based on model reference adaptive [11].\nAdding a tension sensor to the system, direct feedback of the\ntension can be achieved; however, an observer-based tension\ncontrol strategy can be used to avoid measurement errors\ncaused by insufﬁcient accuracy and reduce the cost and com-\nplexity of the control system. The presence of disturbances is\nwell observed [12]–[14]. In order to improve the robustness\nof the tension control system and meet the requirements of\ntension control for real-time performance and response speed,\nVincent Gassmann et al. proposed an improvement method\nbased on H∞[15].\nMany factors need to be considered in the design of the ten-\nsion control system, and the slight change of speed can cause\nobvious ﬂuctuation of tension. This paper needs to realize the\nautomatic winding of the insulation layer of the oval iron core\ntransformer. The geometric shape of the winding core shaft,\nbesides the acceleration and deceleration process, can affect\nthe large ﬂuctuation of tension. During the insulation belt\ntransmission from unwinder to the main shaft, for example,\nin the process of ﬁxation under constant torque, the tension\nof the insulating tape can change with the radius change\nof the unwinder and the transformer core mold [16], [17].\nIf the tension is too small, the main shaft cannot drive the\ninsulating belt forward, resulting in relaxation that will affect\nthe tightness of the next layer of the coil. If the tension\nis too large or suddenly increased, in addition to wasting\ntorque, it will also cause deformation or even damage to\nthe insulating belt. To obtain better winding quality, it is\nessential to keep the uniform tension of the insulating belt,\nand the passive dancer mechanism, which is composed of\nsprings, shock absorbers, and rollers, has the function of\nenergy storage that may attenuate the impact on the system\nwhen the speed and tension change suddenly [18]. The active\ndancer mechanism has an external driver. By measuring the\nposition of the roller, the external actuator forces the roller\nto adjust the tension, which has the function of feedback\ntension [19]. This paper, thus, combines the two to design\na hybrid dancer mechanism for tension and speed degree\ndisturbance buffer. The design of the variable universe fuzzy\ncontroller does not need much experience of experts in rele-\nvant ﬁelds but only needs to know the general trend of rules.\nSince its universe is adjusted in time with the change of error\nequivalent to adding fuzzy rules, the universe division and\nthe membership function selection turns out to be the less\nsigniﬁcant factors [20], [21], also enhancing the fault-tolerant\nability of system control. According to the above analysis,\naiming at the problems of low efﬁciency of insulating layer\nVOLUME 8, 2020 95069\nH. Huanget al.: Design and Analysis of Tension Control System for Transformer Insulation Layer Winding\nplacement, as well as poor product quality and consistency,\na fuzzy PI tension control system with hybrid dancer position\nfeedback is suggested in this study for transformer insulat-\ning layer automatic winding, which realizes automatic and\nefﬁcient winding of insulating layer, stabilizes the tension in\nthe winding process, and decreases the tension disturbance\ncaused by the spindle geometry.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In the second section,\nthe automatic winding system of the insulation layer is\noffered, and the dynamic model is developed. In the third\nsection, the causes of the tension disturbance are analyzed,\nthe frequency of the disturbance is predicted, the tension\ncontrol strategy is presented, and the tension controller based\non a fuzzy theory of the variable universe is designed. In the\nfourth section, the controller is simulated and tested using\nexperiments, and the performance of the proposed tension\ncontrol system is veriﬁed as compared to the traditional PID\ncontrol method.\nII. MECHANICAL STRUCTURE AND DYNAMIC MODELING\nFig 2 is a schematic diagram of the designed automatic\nwinding system for the insulation layer of the transformer.\nThe entire system is divided roughly into three sections,\nthe unwinding section, the transportation section, the rewind-\ning section; the rewinding is the main shaft that primarily\nrealizes speed adjustment. The insulating tape is installed\non the mandrel of the unwinder, and a certain initial speed\nratio exists between the main and the uncoiling shaft, caus-\ning continuous tension in the winding process. The tension\nadjustment is to adjust the pressure in the dancer cylinder by\nthe potentiometer knob of the control panel. If the dancer arm\nremains in the reference position during the system operation,\nthe cylinder pressure on the dancer arm is approximately\nequal to twice the tension setting value (the gravity action of\nthe dancer itself and the insulating tape need to be considered;\nthus, generally, the cylinder pressure is slightly more than\ntwice the expected tension value). Therefore, a displacement\nsensor is added to the dancer part. The unwinder speed is\nadjusted by position feedback so that the dancer may be\nkept near the reference position as far as possible, and the\ncontinuous tracking of tension may be realized. The dynamic\nFIGURE 2. Schematic diagram of transformer insulation tape automatic\nwinding system: 1-Rewind roll 2-Guide roll 3-Counting roll 4-Dancer roll\n5-Cyliner 6-Position sensor 7-Unwind roll 8-Guide roll.\ncharacteristics of free rollers are typically overlooked since\nthey only affect the dynamic characteristics of the system\nthroughout acceleration and deceleration. In the present\nresearch, it is supposed that there is no relative slip, in the\nprocess of transmission, between the paper tape and the roller.\nThe analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the unwinding\nand rewinding section is as the following.\nA. UNWIND ROLL MODELING\nThe unwind section includes the unwinder and the dancer\nmechanism. A servo motor gives rise to the unwinding shaft.\nAs the winding task progresses, the radius of the insulating\npaper tape reel on the unwinding roller continuously reduces.\nThe effective moment of inertia J 1 (t) at time t may be\nexpressed as:\nJ1 (t)=Jm1 +Jc1 +Jw1 (t) (1)\nwhere J m1 is the inertia of all rotating components on the\nmotor side, J c1 is the inertia of uncoiling roller, and J w1 (t)\nis the inertia of insulated paper tape reel and material.\nJm1 and J c1 are constants that do not change with time.\nOwing to the constant transmission of insulating paper tape,\nJw1 (t)changes over time. J w1 (t)may be expressed as:\nJw1 (t)=π\n2 Hp(R4\n1 (t)−R4\nc1 (t)) (2)\nwhere H is the width of insulating paper tape, p is the density\nof insulating paper tape, R c1 is the radius of uncoiling roller,\nand R 1(t) is the radius of insulating paper tape reel. The\ndynamic model of the uncoiling roller may be deﬁned as\nfollows:\n˙J1w1 +J1 ˙w1 =T1R1 −n2\n1U1 −bf 1w1 (3)\nwhere n 1 is the transmission ratio between the servo motor\nshaft and the uncoiling roller, w 1 is the angular speed of\nthe uncoiling roller, and b f1 is the friction coefﬁcient of the\nuncoiling roller. From formula (1), it may be concluded that\nthe rate of change of J 1 (t)is only associated with J w1 (t), and\nthe rate of change of J 1 (t)can be obtained from formula (2)\nas follows:\n˙J1 (t)=˙Jw1 (t)=2πHpR3\n1 ˙R1 (4)\nThe change rate ˙R1 of R1 is a function of the tangent speed\nof V1 the insulating tape and the thickness w of the insulating\ntape that may be deﬁned as follows:\n˙R1 ≈− wV1(t)\n2πR1(t) (5)\n˙R1 in formula (5) is an approximate representation since\nthe radius only changes when the tape winding is completed.\nThe tangential velocity V 1(t) of t at any time is associated\nwith the angular velocity w 1(t) of the uncoiling roller and\nthe radius of the insulating tape at that time; thus, it may be\nachieved:\n˙w1 =\n˙V1\nR1\n−\n˙R1V1\nR2\n1\n(6)\n95070 VOLUME 8, 2020\nH. Huanget al.: Design and Analysis of Tension Control System for Transformer Insulation Layer Winding\nAccording to formulas (3), (4), (5), and (6), the following\ncan be obtained:\nJ1\nR1\n˙V1\n=T1R1 −n2\n1U1 −bf 1\nV1\nR1\n− w\n2πR1\n( J1\nR2\n1\n−2πHpR2\n1)V 2\n1\n(7)\nThe insulating paper tape with a span between uncoiling\nroller and dancer roller is analyzed by using the law of mass\nconservation, and the dynamic characteristics of uncoiling\nroller tension T 1 are given by the following formula:\nL1 ˙T1 =AE (V2 −V1)+V1T 0 −V2T1 +AEld ˙θ(t) (8)\nwhere L1 is the length of the insulating paper tape between the\nuncoiling roller and the dancer roller, A is the cross-sectional\narea of the insulating paper tape, E is Young’s elastic modulus\nof the insulating paper tape, V 2 is the speed of the dancer roll,\nT0 is the entrainment tension of the insulating paper tape on\nthe uncoiling roll, l d is the length of the dancer swing arm,\nand θis the offset angle of the dancer. In the working process\nof the uncoiling rod, the radius and inertia are reducing, and\nthe dynamic characteristics of the system are continuously\nchanging. Under the assumption that the radius change is\nquasi-static, the gain constant between the control signal and\nthe tension of the insulating paper tape is approximately\nproportional to the inverse of the radius, Gain U\n(\nTu\nuu\n)\n= 1\nRu ; if\nthere is a large difference in inertia in the actual system, it will\ndecrease the performance of the controller and even lead to\nsystem instability. It is, therefore, essential to compute the\nmoment of inertia of the uncoiling part and the radius of the\nuncoiling roller in real time and accurately in the unwinding\ncontrol process. They are added to the feedforward control\nsignal to take part in tension control to decrease tension\nﬂuctuations. The feedforward compensation controller has\nbeen designed in reference [12], [13].\nOn the basis of the approximate Archimedes helix length,\nthe approximate length of the insulating tape conveyed from\nthe unwinder may be achieved as follows:\nLweb =πnwinder (2R0 −nwinder H) (9)\nH =2πnwinder R0 −Lweb\nπn2\nwinder\n(10)\nwhere nwinder is the total number of rotation of the uncoiling\nroller, and R 0 is the initial radius of the insulating paper\ntape on the uncoiling roller. To estimate the radius efﬁciently,\nLweb and nwinder can integrate V 1 and ω\n2πH , respectively.\nRest =R0 −wnwinder = Lweb\nπnwinder\n−R0 (11)\nCombining the radius of the current unwinding roll and\nthe initial parameters entered may efﬁciently calculate the\nmoment of inertia. The initial parameters entered com-\nprise the mass and radius of the roll and the hollow core\ndrum, together with the inertia and transmission ratio of the\nunchanged part of the equipment. According to the calcula-\ntion of the radius of the insulating paper tape on the reeling\nroller, the approximate quality of the paper tape on the roll\nmay be achieved initially:\nmwebest =ρwebπ\n(\nR2\nest −R2\ncore\n)\n(12)\nJwebest =1\n2mwebest\n(\nR2\nest −R2\ncore\n)\n(13)\nThe density of insulating paper tape per meter length of the\nreel may be deﬁned as:\nρweb = mfull −mcore\nπ\n(\nR2\nfull −R2core\n) (14)\nTherefore, formula (11) can be expressed as:\nJwebest =1\n2\n(\nmfull −mcore\n)(\nR4\nest −R4\ncore\n)\nR2\nfull −R2core\n(15)\nFor the inertia of the whole system, the insulating tape, reel,\nand roll are essential to be calculated to the motor side.\nJtotal =Jsys +Jcore +Jwebest\nN2 (16)\nB. DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF DANCER MECHANISM\nThe hybrid dancer system is shown in Fig 3. The angular\ndisplacement dynamic characteristics of dancer are obtained\nbased on torque balance, which can be expressed as follows:\nJd\nd2θ\ndt2 =Fclc cos θ−(ld −R2)T1 cos θ\n−Md glg sin θ−Bf −(ld +R2)T2 cos θ (17)\nwhere Jd and Md are the inertia and mass of the whole dancer\nmechanism, F c is the pressure of the cylinder to the dancer\nmechanism, l c is the distance from the ﬁxed center of the\ndancer pendulum circle to the cylinder, T 1 and T 2 are the\nupstream and downstream tension of the dancer, and R 2 is\nthe radius of the dancer roller. Since the spindle mandrel\nis non-circular, the angular displacement θ of the dancer is\nalways ﬂoating, and the ﬂoating of the dancer is larger in\nthe acceleration and deceleration stage that may efﬁciently\nreduce the impact on the system due to the sudden change of\nvelocity.\nFIGURE 3. Dancer subsystem model.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 95071\nH. Huanget al.: Design and Analysis of Tension Control System for Transformer Insulation Layer Winding\nThe cylinder support force for the dancer to keep the dancer\nin the reference position in the steady-state:\nFc =2Ld Tref\nLa\n(18)\nwhere Ld is the distance from the center of the circle around\nthe dancer arm to the center of the dancer roll, L a is the\ndistance from the center of the circle around the dancer arm\nto the support point of the cylinder, and T ref is the expected\ntension.\nBy changing the span length of the upstream and down-\nstream and the inertia of the dancer system, their inﬂuence\non the resonant frequency and response performance of the\nsystem is analyzed and mastered. Figs 4 and 5 demonstrate\nthe bode diagram.\nFIGURE 4. Bode plots with different span lengths.\nBy the increase of the downstream span, the resonant\nfrequency increases, and the bandwidth widens. Shortening\nthe upstream span and increasing the downstream span, thus,\nmake the former smaller than the latter, which may efﬁciently\nimprove the stability and responsibility of the hybrid dancer\nsystem. The smaller the inertia of the dancer mechanism,\nthe higher the resonant frequency. When designing the dancer\nmechanism, decreasing its inertia can moderately improve the\ncontrol performance of large-scale interference. In the design\nof the hybrid dancer tension control system, it is essential to\nachieve a shorter upstream span and less dancer inertia so\nthat the system can maintain a good response even at low\noperating speed, and the PI gain determined at low speed can\nalso meet the requirements of high-speed operation.\nC. REWIND ROLL MODELING\nIn spindle winding process, the spindle radius R 3 becomes\nlarger, and the inertia J3 increases; the dynamics of the spindle\npart is similar to that of the unwinding part that may be\nFIGURE 5. Dancer bode plot with different inertia.\nexpressed as follows:\nJ3\nR3\n˙V3 =−T 2R3 +n2\n3U3 −bf 3\nV3\nR3\n− w\n2πR3\n( J3\nR2\n3\n−2πHpR2\n3)V 2\n3 (19)\nL2 ˙T2 =AE (V3 −V2)+V2T 1 −V3T2 +AEld ˙θ(t) (20)\nIII. CONTROLLER DESIGN\nWhen the PI control method after setting gain is used to\nwind the insulation layer of transformer, the change curve\nof tension and dancer position of the unwind section is as\nshown in ﬁgure 6, the reference tension is 50N, the dancer\nposition and tension overshoot when the unwinder accelerates\nand decelerates, and the tension has an apparent steady-state\nerror when the speed is at the reference value for a while.\nIt may be observed from the ﬁgure that the tension ﬂuctuation\nis greater than ±6% of the working tension, and the maximum\nﬂuctuation exceeds 10% of the reference value. There is a\nstrong coupling between the position of the dancer and the\ntension and the velocity.\nThe fundamental reason for the tension disturbance is the\ncontinuous change of speed. First, in steady-state operation,\ndue to the geometric shape of the rewinding roll, when it\nmoves to the long side of the roll, the radius smaller, and\nthe tangential velocity decreases, whereas, when it moves to\nthe short side of the roll, the radius becomes larger, and the\ntangential velocity increases, resulting in a large tension ﬂuc-\ntuation. Secondly, owing to the continuous reduction of the\nradius of the paper tray in the unwinding process, the tangent\nspeed of the tape changes, resulting in tension disturbance,\nand the tension ﬂuctuation will be transferred to the next\nstage [22].\nTypically, the allowable tension ﬂuctuation is ±4% of the\nworking tension. Therefore, in the controller design process,\n95072 VOLUME 8, 2020\nH. Huanget al.: Design and Analysis of Tension Control System for Transformer Insulation Layer Winding\nFIGURE 6. Experimental results under the fixed gain PI controller.\n(a) Dancer position. (b) Unwind tension. (c) Unwind speed.\nit is essential to consider the performance of the system’s\nresponse to the maximum tension disturbance and improve\nthe speed of the system’s adjustment to the disturbance\nin order to reduce the tension ﬂuctuation caused by speed\nchange and improve the accuracy of insulating tape ten-\nsion control. When the paper tape on the uncoiling roller is\ntransported to the next stage, the diameter of the paper tray\ndecreases, and the frequency of tension increases; the range\nof tension disturbance can be determined by formula (21).\nIf, for instance, the diameter of the uncoiling roller is 0.5m to\n0.2m, the maximum frequency is 66.67rad/s to 116.67rad/s\nwhen the speed is 400m/min to 700m/min.\nωmax = 2v0\nDmin\n, ω min = 2v0\nDmax\n(21)\nThe tension disturbance is transmitted from upstream to\ndownstream.

In some cases, the disturbance is beyond the\nnormal working range since the tension control system shows\na strong nonlinearity, coupling, and uncertainty. The conven-\ntional PID control method may only achieve a normal control\neffect in the local working area of the system, and the control\nparameters cannot be adjusted in real time with the change of\nthe system dynamic characteristics.\nA. VARIABLE UNIVERSE FUZZY PI TENSION CONTROL\nSYSTEM\nAlthough the traditional fuzzy PID may be adjusted in real\ntime, it hinges on too much on the control rules, and the\nrules themselves have redundancy and roughness. The perfor-\nmance of the controller is limited by the ﬁxed fuzzy universe\nand scale factor. Once the input error is reduced, more fuzzy\nrules fail, leading to large static errors in the control process\nthat cannot meet the needs of control accuracy and adjustment\nrange. The design idea of fuzzy controller based on the vari-\nable universe is to change the initial range of input and output\ndomain in real time with the error and error rate of change\nthat may effectively compress the universe when the system\nerror is small, improve the response speed, control accuracy\nVOLUME 8, 2020 95073\nH. Huanget al.: Design and Analysis of Tension Control System for Transformer Insulation Layer Winding\nwithout increasing the number of control rules, and slightly\nextend the universe when the error is large in order to adapt\nto the uncertain disturbance in the system. By introducing the\nscaling factor to adjust the initial universe scope in real time,\nthe controller adjusts the PI parameters on-line and realizes\nthe variable universe fuzzy PI control. It is essential, in the\nprocess of practical application, to multiply all the points in\nthe universe by the scaling factor to simplify the calculation\nand strengthen the application in order to apply the method\nof equivalent processing: the quantization factor Ke of error e\nand the quantization factor Kec of the error change rate ˙e are\ndivided by the corresponding input universe scaling factor\nα(e), α(ec), respectively; the output quantization factor Kus\nis multiplied by the corresponding output universe scaling\nfactors βp, βi. The designed tension adjustment system is dis-\nplayed in Fig 8. K2 is a proportional coefﬁcient that depends\non the unwinding radius and the gear ratio between the roller\nand the motor shaft. The control scheme consists of the speed\ninner ring and the position outer ring; the outer ring adjusts\nthe unwinder speed through position feedback to perform\ntension control, and Beckhoff driver adjusts the inner loop.\nFIGURE 8. Tension control system block diagram.\nB. FUZZY PI CONTROLLER\nThe error e and the rate of error change ˙e are applied as\nthe input of the fuzzy controller; 1Kp and 1Ki are applied\nas the output of the controller. The dynamic range of the\nactual operation of the system is standardized. It is stated\nthat the initial universe of the variables e, 1Kp, and 1Ki is\n[−6,+6], the initial universe of the rate of error change ˙e\nis [ −3,+3], and the dynamic range of the actual operation\nof the system is [emax,emin],\n[\necmax ,ecmin\n]\n,\n[\n1Ksmax ,1K smin\n]\n(wheres =P,I). The standardized transformation formula of\nthe universe is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKe = 12\nemax −emin\n, E =Ke\n(\ne−emax −emin\n2\n)\nKec = 6\necmax −ecmin\n, Ec =Kec\n(\nec −ecmax −ecmin\n2\n)\nKus = 12\n1Ksmax −1Ksmin\n,\n1kus =Kus\n(\n1Ks −1Ksmax −1Ksmin\n2\n)\n(23)\nThe fuzzy subset is {NB, NM, NS, ZO, PS, PM, PB}.

The member-\nship function of the controller input and output is shown\nin Fig 9.\nFIGURE 9. Membership function of state variables. (a) e(k). (b)1e(k).\nCombined with the experience of tension control expert\nand PID parameter setting experience, the fuzzy logic rules of\ntension 1Kp, 1Ki are established, as shown in Tables 1 and 2.\nTABLE 1. 1Kp fuzzy logic rules.\nThe defuzziﬁcation output using weighted average is:\n1ks =Ai\n∑\ni µ(1ksi)∑\ni µ(1ksi)\n(24)\nThe output of 1Kp and 1Ki in the initial universe is shown\nin Fig 10.\n95074 VOLUME 8, 2020\nH.

UNIVERSE ADJUSTMENT FACTOR\nThe design of the scaling factor can be selected based on\nfuzzy reasoning or function form. In practical application,\nthe design of the scaling factor is performed in function form\nto simplify the calculation.\nThe setting of the input universe scaling factor ∝x depends\nonly on the input error e and the error rate of change ˙e,\nthe input universe scaling factor is:\n\n\n\nα(x)=\n(|x|\nE\n)τ\n+ετ\nα(x)=1 −λexp\n(\n−kx2) (26)\nwhere τ and λare constants, 0 <τ <1, 0 <λ< 1, and εis\na sufﬁciently small positive number.\nThe scaling factor of the input universe is selected\nas follows: α(x) = 1 −λexp\n(\n−kx2)\n, where λ=0.6,\nk =0.5 represents the input variable e or e c, i.e., α(e) =\n1 −0.6exp\n(\n−0.5e2)\n, α(ec)=1 −0.6exp\n(\n−0.5e2\nc\n)\n.\nThe scaling factor β of the output universe is deﬁned by\nthe input error e and the error rate of change ˙e at the same\ntime. Based on the corresponding state of the current system,\nthe output universe is stretched to varying degrees, and the\nscaling factor of the output universe is:\nβ(t)=KI\nn∑\ni=1\npi\n∫ t\n0\nei (τ)dt +β(0) (27)\nwhere τ is a constant, 0 <τ <1, and K I is a proportional\nconstant, usually β(0)=1. The scaling factor of the output\nuniverse needs to take into account the inﬂuence of K p and Ki\non the control performance. The scaling factor of the output\nvariable K p is consistent with the monotonicity of the error,\nwhereas the scaling factor of the output variable K i has a\nmonotone inverse with the error. For this reason, the scaling\nfactors of the output variables K p and K i are chosen to be\nβp =2 |e|, βi = 1\n|e|+0.7 .\nTo sum up, the output of variable universe adaptive fuzzy\ncontrol may be deﬁned as the following:\ny (x (t +1))=β\nm∑\nj=1\nn∏\ni=1\nAij\n( xi\nαi(t)\n)\nyj (28)\nwhere A ij is the membership function of the fuzzy subset,\nx and y are the input and output of the system, x i is the\ni-th input, and y j is the j-th output. Combining the theory\nof variable universe and fuzzy PI control, the system state\nadjusts the input and output universe adaptively to make up\nfor the shortcomings of traditional fuzzy PID control.\nIV. EXPERIMENT AND RESULT\nTo test the effectiveness of the proposed control system in\nreducing tension disturbance, a simulation test is performed\naccording to the reference values presented in Table 3 and 4.\nFigs. 11 (a) (b), 12 (a) (b), and 13 (a) (b) are respectively\nthe response results of the corresponding reference tension\nat different start and end velocities. At t =5 s, the unwinding\nsection introduces speed step interference to make the tension\nﬂuctuate.\nTABLE 3. Speed and tension parameters.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 95075\nH. Huanget al.: Design and Analysis of Tension Control System for Transformer Insulation Layer Winding\nTABLE 4. Parameters used in simulation.\nThrough the designed variable universe fuzzy controller,\n1Kp and 1Ki are obtained to adjust the values of K p and Ki.\nFigs 11 (c) (d), 12 (c) (d), and 13 (c) (d) show that\nwhen the reference tension is 20N, 30N, 50N respectively,\nthe initial and ﬁnal speed steps to 100rpm/200rpm, K p,\nand K i are adaptively adjusted with the change of tension\nerror. Fig 14 shows the error peak value of the corresponding\nreference tension at different start and end velocities.\nIt may be evidently observed that compared to the ﬁxed\ngain PI control method, the proposed control method may\neffectively reduce the overshoot and undershoot of tension.\nIn the traditional PID controller, once the speed disturbance\nchanges from 100rpm to 200rpm, the error peak of ten-\nsion increases, and when the speed changes from 200rpm\nto 300rpm, the tension has a larger steady-state error; also,\nthe estimated gain of the proposed controller can compensate\nthe change of speed quickly, improve the response speed\nof the system, and reduce the steady-state error. It shows\nbetter disturbance adjustment ability.\nIn this paper, the stability and accuracy of the control\nmethod proposed are veriﬁed by the insulation winding sys-\ntem shown in Fig 2, In the course of the experiment, follow\nthese steps. First, the insulating paper tape of the unwinding\nroll is passed through the follower roller and the guide roller,\nthrough the dancer mechanism into the counting wheel, then\nthrough the follower roller and the guide roller; the paper\ntape is ﬁxed to the spindle core mold; the air pressure is\nwashed into the cylinder according to the tension set by\nthe potentiometer knob; the cylinder is pushed to the limit\nposition −15◦due to the relaxation pressure of the insulation\nbelt. Secondly, the unwinding section is closed through the\nposition loop feedback by the position sensor, the dancer\nreturns to the reference position (the dancer arm is perpen-\ndicular to the roller and keeps at 0 ◦position), and the tension\nis kept near the expected value based on which the winding\nwork can be started. Finally, the reference speed change of\nthe unwinding roller between the 100 −300rpm is input to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the system for tension and dancer\nposition control. The only other part that controls the tension\nof the insulating paper tape during the test is the spindle\npart of the PID controller that functions in the speed ring\nmode. There is an initial speed ratio N between the winding\nFIGURE 11. Effect of velocity step disturbance on reference tension 20N.\n(a) Initial speed: 100rpm, Final speed: 200rpm.

Throughout the whole\nVOLUME 8, 2020 95077\nH. Huanget al.: Design and Analysis of Tension Control System for Transformer Insulation Layer Winding\nFIGURE 14. Tension error peak.\nwinding process, the tension ﬂuctuates in the range of ±4%\nof the reference tension, and the dancer position ﬂuctuates\nbetween −1.21◦and −1.87◦.\nTo show that the control system proposed in this paper\nhas the better adaptive ability in insulation tape winding of\nelliptical iron core transformer and evaluate its effective-\nness in reducing tension disturbance and steady-state error,\nthe control method proposed, in this paper is compared with\nthe ﬁxed gain PI control method, and reference tension is set\nto 50N; the results of the position ﬂuctuation of the dancer,\nas well as tension change are shown in ﬁgure 16.\nThe speed starts to change at 60s, and the tension under the\nﬁxed gain PI control has a great interference with the change\nof speed that only meets the requirement of working tension\nin part of the time. With the increase of speed, the precision\nof tension control decreases, the peak value of tension error\nincreases with acceleration and deceleration, and the dancer\nﬂoat is quite strong. The tension ﬂuctuation of the control\nmethod proposed in this article remains in a small range\nwhen the speed changes greatly. The overshoot of paper\ntape tension is decreased, and the system response speed is\naccelerated; the gain estimate is constantly adjusted with the\ntension error, the tension ﬂuctuation is effectively limited to\nthe allowable range of ±4% all through the working period,\nand the dancer position may be maintained in a smaller\nﬂoating range.\nThrough experiments, it may be obtained that the\ntangential velocity of the insulating paper tape in the winding\nprocess of the spindle changes periodically according to the\ncurve illustrated in Fig 17(a); the tension changes are illus-\ntrated in Fig 17(b).\nSince the geometric shape of the transformer core is\napproximately oval, the tangent speed of the paper tape varies\nperiodically with the radius of the mandrel throughout the\nwinding process, causing the tension to ﬂuctuate constantly\nand periodically. According to the test results at different\nwinding speeds, it may be observed that the tension ﬂuctu-\nation is within the allowable range of ±4%.\nTwo criteria are deﬁned to assess the performance of\ndifferent controllers in order to compare and analyze the\nFIGURE 15.

Controller performance comparison.\nTable 5 shows the values of the evaluation criteria under the\ntwo control modes. Compared with ﬁxed gain PID control,\nthe proposed control methods in both the reference track-\ning performance and reduced coupling system are improved.\nOn the contrary, under ﬁxed gain PI control mode, the posi-\ntion and tension ﬂuctuate greatly around the reference value,\nand the coupling between the tension and speed is obvious;\nhowever, quicker response speed can still be kept through the\nreasonable setting parameters. Under the control method in\nVOLUME 8, 2020 95079\nH. Huanget al.: Design and Analysis of Tension Control System for Transformer Insulation Layer Winding\nFIGURE 17. Spindle tension under variable universe fuzzy PI control.\n(a) Rewind speed. (b) Rewind tension (VUF PI Controller).\nthis article, although the ﬂuctuation of the tension and the\nposition of the dancer have been signiﬁcantly reduced during\nacceleration and deceleration, a slight oscillation of position\nand tension in the reference attachment can be observed\nduring steady-state operation; the main reason for these phe-\nnomena is the eccentricity and irregularity of the roller. It can\nalso be seen that the average of the tension, in transmission\nand stops, is different due to the dynamic and static friction\nin the process of starting and stopping the driven roller; as\nthe speed increases, the better effect. It is explained that the\ndynamic characteristics of driven roller affect paper tension;\nin the case of need higher control precision, it can be based on\nthe driven roller friction model by adding feedforward control\nto provide effective compensation amount.\nGenerally, the traditional PID controller is applicable in\nindustrial applications; however, for the industrial applica-\ntions with fast-tracking reference signals and high control\nprecision, it is essential to adjust the controller parameters\nonline in order to adapt to the change of system error. Variable\nuniverse fuzzy PI control is suitable to solve this problem, and\nthe controller parameters are adjusted in real time accord-\ning to the change of error; it can well adjust and restrain\nthe speed interference and tension ﬂuctuation caused by the\neccentricity and non-roundness of the roller. The structure\nof the control system based on the dancer position is simple\nand does not need to add a tension sensor that reduces the\ncomplexity and cost in industrial applications and meets the\nrequirements of high tension precision. It provides a reference\nfor the design and application of a tension control system for\nan insulating layer of the elliptical core transformer.\nV. CONCLUSION\n(1) In the unwinding section, the larger deviation of uncoiling\nroll radius and inertia can lead to large tension ﬂuctuation.\nThe larger upstream span length and its inertia in the design\nprocess of the dancer system can reduce the resonant fre-\nquency and response performance of the system.\n(2) During steady-state operation, part of the tension dis-\nturbance of the winding section is caused by the time-varying\ncharacteristics of radius and inertia; however, the tangent\nspeed of the insulating paper tape ﬂuctuates continuously due\nto the periodic change of the core mold radius, resulting in\nperiodic deviation of tension set value.\n(3) In this study, a tension control system with hybrid\ndancer position feedback for transformer insulation winding\nis proposed, and a variable universe fuzzy PI controller is\ndesigned to adjust the unwinder speed. Compared with the\ntraditional PID control method, the proposed model may\neffectively reduce the inﬂuence of tension disturbance in the\ninsulation winding process of the elliptical iron core trans-\nformer. It has strong self-adaptation and anti-interference\nability and can better meet the tension control requirements\nof the system at different winding speeds. It can solve the\nproblems of low efﬁciency and poor consistency in a manual\nwinding of transformer insulation.\nREFERENCES\n[1] F. S.-L. Blanc, J. Fleischer, M. Schmitt, M. Unger, and J.
