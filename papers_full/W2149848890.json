    "abstract": "To study and locate partial discharge(PD) and analyze the transient state of power transformer, there is a need for a high frequency model of transformer winding and calculation of its parameters. Due to the high frequency nature of partial discharge phenomenon, there is a need for an accurate model for this frequency range. To attain this goal, a Multi-Conductor Transmission Line (MTL) model is used in this paper for modeling this transformer winding. In order that the MTL model can properly simulate the transformer behavior within a frequency range it is required that its parameters be accurately calculated. In this paper, all the basic parameters of this model are calculated by the use of Finite Element Method (FEM) for a 20kV winding of a distribution transformer. The comparison of the results obtained from this model with the obtained shape of the waves by the application of PD pulse to the winding in laboratory environment shows the validity and accuracy of this model.",
