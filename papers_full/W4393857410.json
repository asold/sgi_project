I aimed to explore the capacity of the multimodal large \nlanguage model (LLM) in addressing multiple-choice and \nimage-based radiology exam questions.\nLarge language models are advancing in radiology for \ntasks such as report generation, clinical decision support, \nand data analysis [2 ]. ChatGPT has achieved satisfactory \nresults in radiology board exam questions that do not include \nimages [3, 4]. The latest version, GPT-4, a multimodal LLM, \nis capable of providing text output not only from text input \nbut also from image inputs. A sample test consisting of \nseven multiple response questions from the European Board \nof Radiology (EBR) exam organized by the European Soci-\nety of Radiology was reviewed (https:// edir. myebr. org/ pub-\nlic/ sampl e/? id= 52# exam/ 52). Data collection from GPT-4 \nwas conducted in March 2024. The questions indicate that \nmultiple answers could be correct, and one question requires \nthe correct sequencing of anatomical locations. While the \nmaximum score per question is 1, incorrect answers result in \npoint deductions (https:// www. myebr. org/ edir- scori ng- faqs#: \n~: text= Pass% 20mar k(WWS)% 20% 3D% 20Min imum,% \n25)% 20and% 20Max imum(70% 25)). GPT-4 achieved a 50% \naccuracy by scoring 1.5 out of 3 in purely text-based ques-\ntions. In questions including images, it reached 1.67 points, \nachieving 41.75% accuracy. Overall, it secured 3.7 out of 7 \npoints, attaining a performance of 45.3%.\nThe performance of GPT-4 in multiple-choice questions \nthat require medical image analysis and may have multi-\nple correct answers is noteworthy. The performance in a \ncomplete EBR exam, which includes free text responses, is \nof interest. The broad potential of multimodal LLMs from \nradiology reporting to clinical support tools will inspire new \nstudies.\nReferences\n 1. Nakaura T, Yoshida N, Kobayashi N, et al.
