    "abstract": "Phenotype-driven gene prioritization is fundamental to diagnosing rare genetic disorders. While traditional approaches rely on curated knowledge graphs with phenotype-gene relations, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) promise a streamlined text-to-gene solution. In this study, we evaluated five LLMs, including two generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) series and three Llama2 series, assessing their performance across task completeness, gene prediction accuracy, and adherence to required output structures. We conducted experiments, exploring various combinations of models, prompts, phenotypic input types, and task difficulty levels. Our findings revealed that the best-performed LLM, GPT-4, achieved an average accuracy of 17.0% in identifying diagnosed genes within the top 50 predictions, which still falls behind traditional tools. However, accuracy increased with the model size. Consistent results were observed over time, as shown in the dataset curated after 2023. Advanced techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and few-shot learning did not improve the accuracy. Sophisticated prompts were more likely to enhance task completeness, especially in smaller models. Conversely, complicated prompts tended to decrease output structure compliance rate. LLMs also achieved better-than-random prediction accuracy with free-text input, though performance was slightly lower than with standardized concept input. Bias analysis showed that highly cited genes, such as BRCA1, TP53, and PTEN, are more likely to be predicted. Our study provides valuable insights into integrating LLMs with genomic analysis, contributing to the ongoing discussion on their utilization in clinical workflows.",
