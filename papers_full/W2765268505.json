    "abstract": "In this work, the flow effects on an isolation plugging tool in a pipeline were numerically investigated using computational fluid dynamics. The study focused on optimal parameter design for the isolation plugging tool, which reduced the unsteady force effects on the x and y directions of the flow field. First, three-dimensional models of the isolation plugging tool and pipe were built. The velocity, pressure, and force analysis on the flow past the isolation plugging tool were investigated via computational fluid dynamics simulation. Second, a combination of design parameter ratios was selected using the Box–Behnken method for a series of numerical experiments. From the simulation results, three regression total force models were determined for the x, y , and z directions using response surface methodology. A modified genetic algorithm was proposed to optimize the design parameter ratios for the isolation plugging tool based on the regression models. The optimum parameter ratios were chosen and verified using the simulation results.",
