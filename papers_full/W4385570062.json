However, there is limited data\non their safety and performance in real-world\nscenarios. This study uses data collected using\nan autonomous telemedicine clinical assistant.\nThe assistant asks symptom-based questions to\nelicit patient concerns and allows patients to\nask questions about their post-operative recov-\nery. We utilise real-world postoperative ques-\ntions posed to the assistant by a cohort of 120\npatients to examine the safety and appropriate-\nness of responses generated by a recent popular\nLLM by OpenAI, ChatGPT. We demonstrate\nthat LLMs have the potential to helpfully ad-\ndress routine patient queries following routine\nsurgery. However, important limitations around\nthe safety of today’s models exist which must\nbe considered.\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, large language models have gained\nimmense popularity. These models are capable of\ngenerating and understanding natural language at\npreviously unimaginable levels, making them in-\ndispensable in a wide-range of natural language\napplications. In the last few months, this popularity\nhas been fuelled by the recent breakthrough of Ope-\nnAI’s ChatGPT, which has made LLMs accessible\nto the wider public.\nLLMs are versatile and can be repurposed to\nwork in a variety of different domains. Develop-\ners and researchers around the world have demon-\nstrated the usefulness of these transformer-based\nmodels in sectors like retail (Paul et al., 2023), fi-\nnance (Yue et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023) and soft-\nware engineering (Surameery and Shakor, 2023)\nbut one sector that still hasn’t absorbed the bene-\nfits of large language models is healthcare. Most\n*These authors contributed equally to this work\nhealthcare interactions are conversations in natu-\nral language (Simpson et al., 1991), which means\nLLMs have huge potential in this area, but the com-\nplexities around safety and reliability of these mod-\nels raise concerns that have yet to be addressed\n(Harrer, 2023; Bender et al.). There have been at-\ntempts to address this problem by approaches like\nfine-tuning, prompt-engineering, prompt-tuning\n(Lester et al., 2021), RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022),\nbut the lack of benchmarks and consensus around\nobjective evaluation metrics for this domain makes\nthis a challenging problem to solve.\nAuthors of Med-PaLM (Singhal et al., 2022)\nhave attempted to address this issue by releasing\nbenchmarks and strategies that can be used to eval-\nuate the usefulness of these models in the health-\ncare setting. In this work, we adapt these evalua-\ntion strategies to test how a large language model\nresponds to patient questions following cataract\nsurgery. This is a significant clinical use case as ap-\nproximately 20M cataract surgeries are performed\neach year in the world (Rossi et al., 2021). We use\nthe data collected by an autonomous telemedicine\nclinical assistant that elicits post-operative con-\ncerns from patients by asking them symptom-based\nquestions about their operated eye. We use the ques-\ntions asked by patients to this assistant to examine\nthe safety and appropriateness of responses from\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n2 Related Work\nThere has been significant interest in either devel-\noping medical large language models (Lee et al.,\n2020; Singhal et al., 2022; Moor et al., 2023) or\nusing existing large language models like GPT-4\nfor healthcare applications (Lee et al., 2023). How-\never, many authors have pointed out the current\nshortcomings of LLMs for healthcare (Moor et al.,\n2023; Lee et al., 2023) and ethical barriers to their\nadoption (Harrer, 2023).\nWithin healthcare, many authors have demon-\n131\nFigure 1: Clinical evaluation of LLM responses to patient questions without symptom information\nstrated the performance of various LLMs in tasks\nwith clearly defined ‘correct’ answers, such as its\nperformance on physician licensing examinations\nlike the United States Medical Licensing Exami-\nnation (USMLE) or speciality-specific exams like\nthe Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program\n(OKAP) (Singhal et al., 2022; Nori et al., 2023;\nTeebagy et al., 2023; Gilson et al., 2023; Antaki\net al., 2023).\nWhilst impressive in its demonstration of clinical\n‘knowledge’ through its performance in multiple-\nchoice examinations, for the majority of real-world\nclinical tasks such as note-taking and medical con-\nversations, evaluation of what constitutes ‘good’\nfor performance has been challenging (Singhal\net al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023). Indeed, the authors of\nthe landmark holistic evaluation of language mod-\nels (HELM) framework (Liang et al., 2022) high-\nlighted the importance of benchmarking against\nhuman-evaluation metrics to identify issues like\nhallucinations or disinformation.\nCorrespondingly, previous authors have utilised\nvarious human evaluation metrics for healthcare-\ndomain LLM tasks. In a study by Nov et al. (2023),\nlay people assessed ChatGPT’s medical question\nanswers firstly for whether the answers were distin-\nguishable from a human, and secondly via a Likert\nscale for their trust in the use of chatbot responses.\nAlternatively, other authors have used specialist\ngraders to assess the suitability of answers. Tsui\net al. (2023) presented a simplified approach us-\ning only two questions with binary outcomes for\n“precision” and “suitability” as assessed by five\nretinal specialists in response to a set of hypothet-\nical frequently asked questions in the context of\na retina clinic. Liu et al. (2023) evaluated the po-\ntential for ChatGPT as a clinical decision system\n(CDS) with metrics such as understandability, use-\nfulness, bias and redundancy in comparison with\nhuman-generated suggestions. However, an addi-\ntional qualitative analysis was required to capture\nother comments around the presence of inappro-\npriate information or hallucinations not initially\nevaluated as part of the Likert scale-based metrics.\nSinghal et al. (2022)’s approach in evaluating the\nMed-PaLM model has been the most comprehen-\nsive. They introduce a 12-axis evaluation frame-\nwork administered by a clinician, with 2 additional\nquestions to evaluate question utility for lay users.\nThe dataset of questions used for model prompting\nconsisted of general medical knowledge searched\nfor by consumers online, and results were com-\npared between Med-PaLM and clinician responses.\nOur work builds on this by utilising real patient\nquestions about recovery from cataract surgery pro-\nvided to a telemedicine clinical assistant. We adapt\na simplified version of Singhal et al. (2022)’s hu-\nman evaluation framework with ophthalmologist\nevaluation of ChatGPT’s responses to patient ques-\ntions.\n132\nFigure 2: Clinical evaluation of responses with and without symptom information\nExamples of ChatGPT answers that were opposed to scientific consensus and with a medium likelihood of\nthe risk of sight loss or severe harm.\nPatient Question Answer\njust just just one question I do\nhave a slight shadow in my left\neye on the left hand side\nThank you for your question. It is not uncommon for patients to experience some\nchanges in their vision after cataract surgery, and this can include the appearance of\nshadows or halos around lights. It is important to keep in mind that it can take some\ntime for your vision to fully adjust and for any post-surgical effects to resolve. In the\nmeantime, it is important to follow your doctor’s instructions for care and use of any\nprescribed eye drops. If you are experiencing any significant discomfort or if the\nshadow in your vision does not improve over time, it is important to contact your\ndoctor for further evaluation\ni have double vision.\nDouble vision, or diplopia, is a common side effect after cataract surgery. It\nusually goes away on its own within a few days to a week. In the meantime, you\ncan try using a single vision eyeglass or patch over one eye to help reduce the double\nvision. It’s important to continue following your post-operative instructions and\ntaking your prescribed eye drops. If the double vision persists or worsens, it’s\nimportant to let your ophthalmologist know so they can assess the cause and\ndetermine the appropriate treatment. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that\nrequire precise vision, such as driving, until the double vision improves.\nTable 1: Text in red have been highlighted by clinicians as against scientific consensus and introducing the potential\nfor harm. Both double vision and new shadows after cataract surgery typically require urgent further assessment\nand exploration to rule out serious sight or life-threatening pathologies.\n3 Method\n3.1 Data Collection\nWe use an autonomous telemedicine clinical assis-\ntant that conducts natural-language conversations\nover the phone with symptom-based questions and\nallows patients to ask questions about their post-\noperative recovery. The question dataset had 131\nunique questions from 120 patients. These ques-\ntions from patients were collected sequentially dur-\ning their automated follow-up calls following rou-\ntine cataract surgery instead of their 1 month post-\nsurgery visit. The calls took place as the standard\nof care at two UK hospitals with registered service\nevaluations. The patients gave explicit consent to\nuse their anonymised data for research purposes.\n3.2 Model Inference\nWe designed a single zero-shot text prompt with\ncontext and instruction to help the model provide\nhelpful and scientifically grounded answers.\n133\n\"You are a helpful conversational\nassistant speaking on telephone to a\npatient 3 weeks after cataract surgery.\nYou call these patients on behalf of the\nhospital after routine, uncomplicated\nsurgery. Patients with concerns get a\ncall back from a human nurse in a few\ndays. You provide useful, complete and\nscientifically-grounded answers to their\nquestions. <Optional Symptom Context>.\nYou ask: “Do you have any questions\nrelating to your operated eye?” and they\nask you: <Patient question>. You answer:\"\nThe prompt was designed using an iterative ap-\nproach utilising synthetic patient questions, with\nclinician involvement to provide qualitative feed-\nback towards broadly acceptable answers. A zero-\nshot prompt was chosen to provide a ‘baseline’\ngiven unknown complexities with other prompting\nstrategies, as was observed by Zhao et al. (2021)\nwho noted that even changing the order of your\nfew-shot examples can destabilise and change ac-\ncuracy by up to 30%. Since we used a voice-based\nassistant to collect data, there were instances where\nthe speech-to-text system mistranscribed the ques-\ntions. We incorporated the questions with the mis-\ntranscriptions into this prompt to provide a more\nrealistic representation of real-world scenarios. We\nutilised two variations of this prompt - one with\nthe patients’ symptoms context and another with-\nout - before feeding it into ChatGPT. (December\n15, 2022 version). We looked at the presence or\nabsence of five symptoms - eye redness, pain, vi-\nsion problems, flashing lights and floaters for each\npatient.\n3.3 Evaluation\nTwo ophthalmologists independently assessed\nChatGPT’s responses and met to resolve any dis-\nagreements. The seven human evaluation questions\n(Figure 1) used to evaluate the model’s responses\non the domains of helpfulness, clinical harm and\nappropriateness were adapted from the Med-PaLM\n(Singhal et al., 2022) work.\n3.4 Results\nFigure 1 shows that on average, most answers were\nrated as addressing the question’s intent. 21% of\nquestions were not felt to be clear - these were\noften due to mistranscriptions to the system, or\nshort statements instead of questions.\nAcross all responses, 59.9% of responses were\nrated ‘helpful’, and 36.3% ‘somewhat helpful’. Al-\nthough harm was overall unlikely with 92.7% rated\nas ‘low’ likelihood of harm, there were a few an-\nswers where ‘sight loss or severe harm’ were pos-\nsible from the responses (Table 1), and 24.4% had\nthe possibility of ‘moderate or mild harm’. 9.5%\nof answers were opposed to clinical or scientific\nconsensus.\nWe observed that most of the instances where\nqueries were not addressed were due to questions\nfrom patients posed as statements. Responses with\nthe highest extent of harm tended to be from ques-\ntions about symptoms.\nWhen we added symptom information (Figure\n2), we observed an increase in the proportion of an-\nswers with inappropriate or incorrect content with\nno increase in the likelihood of clinical reasoning.\nWe suspect that this may be due to the use of the\nsame prompt for both scenarios, and alternative\nmethods for embedding the context and instruc-\ntion information may have improved the model’s\nperformance.\n4 Conclusion\nEven with no fine-tuning and minimal prompt en-\ngineering, we demonstrate that LLMs like Chat-\nGPT have the potential to helpfully address rou-\ntine patient queries from a real-world dataset of\ntranscribed questions following cataract surgery.\nHowever, it is crucial to acknowledge the poten-\ntial constraints associated with the safety of these\nmodels when deployed for healthcare applications.\n5 Limitations and Future Work\nAlthough this study yielded promising results, there\nare limitations to consider. Firstly, minimal prompt\nengineering was used, and context could have\nbeen provided in the form of few-shot or chain-\nof-thought examples, which have been shown to\nincrease accuracy (Wang et al., 2022; Ye et al.,\n2023). Strategies like self-consistency decoding\n(Huang et al., 2022) and retrieval augmentation are\nalso promising for healthcare where varying factual\ncontent of responses from each model even to the\nsame prompt poses a clinical risk. Additionally,\nwe did not compare the LLM responses to those of\nhuman experts, which is an important comparison\nfor appropriateness and safety.\n134\nReferences\nFares Antaki, Samir Touma, Daniel Milad, Jonathan\nEl-Khoury, and Renaud Duval. 2023.
