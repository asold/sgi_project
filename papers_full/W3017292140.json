INTRODUCTION\nThe penetration of distributed generation (DG) sources and\nelectric vehicles (EVs) are increasing rapidly in the mod-\nern power system [1], [2]. Accommodating the additional\nload/generation in the exiting feeders without violating the\ngrid-code speciﬁed power quality limits is a major challenge.\nViolation of steady-state voltage magnitude limits restricts\nthe higher load/DG inclusion in existing feeders. In order\nto improve the static hosting capability of feeders, several\npower management methods are proposed in the literature.\nThe PV hosting capabilities of the distribution feeder are\nimproved using static compensator (STATCOMs) [3] and\nbattery energy storage system (BESS) [4], [5]. The EV load\nhosting capability improvement in a low voltage (LV) distri-\nbution grid is realized using distributed phase-shifting control\n[2]. The voltage sensitivity factors indicate the dependence\nof bus voltage magnitudes for a corresponding change in the\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Alexander Micallef\n.\nactive and the reactive powers at a particular bus [6]. These\nfactors are used to control the voltage rise by managing the\nactive power ﬂow from PV sources in radial distribution grids\n[7]. In [8], the sensitivity factors are utilized for enhancing the\nload/generation hosting capacity of a distribution system with\nthe help of dc interconnection and BESS.\nIn the distribution grid with substantial DG and BESS\ninstallations, the smart transformer (ST) has emerged as a\nsuitable solution for their integration and power management\nrelated problems [9]–[11]. The ST is a power electronics-\nbased transformer with various functionalities in addition to\nthe features of the conventional power transformer (CPT)\n[12]. The volume and weight reduction is one of the main\nhardware gain achieved by the employment of ST. How-\never, in the distribution system applications, the volume and\nweight reduction impact is relatively small, and the efﬁciency,\nreliability plays an important role [11]. Therefore, in order\nto justify the higher cost involved with ST, more services\nare required to be incorporated with it. The medium voltage\n(MV) and LV dc link connectivity is one service, which ST\nVOLUME 8, 2020 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Single-line diagram of a 5-bus radial feeder. (a) Conventional system [18]. (b) Proposed ST based system.\ncan offer in comparison with CPT. The dc-link connectivity\nenables the reactive power decoupling of MV and LV ac\nsides. Moreover, the dc links are utilized to connect electric\nvehicles, renewable sources, battery storage, etc. [13]. The\nreactive power-decoupling feature is utilized for maintain-\ning the unity power factor currents at the MV AC side [11].\nThe ST also can maintain the balanced sinusoidal voltage\nat the LV AC grid irrespective of the load nature. Harmonic\ncompensation capability is also another feature available with\nthe ST MV converter to improve MV ac current quality.\nUnlike CPT, ST is embedded with the fault isolation and\ncurrent limitation control functions [10]. A detailed design\nand analysis of 100 kV A solid state transformer (SST) in a\ndistribution system is presented in [14]. Reverse power ﬂow\ncontrol capability of ST helps in controlling the voltage rise in\nthe MV grid [15]. The load control capability of ST is utilized\nas a power reserve during grid frequency ﬂuctuation [16].\nThe SST is used for interfacing the wind energy conversion\nsystem with the grid in place of CPT [17].\nThe hosting capability improvement using STATCOM is\neffective in distribution grids with a low R/X ratio since it\nutilizes the reactive power exchange. Similarly, BESS based\nsystems are effective in the resistive grids. Utilization of dc\nlines for active power transfer involves the construction of\nextra dc infrastructure parallel to ac line. The application\nof PV converters for capacity enhancement involves active\npower curtailment and this reduces the overall power extrac-\ntion from the available solar energy. The reactive power\ninjection capability of ST has been explored for providing\nvoltage support. The MV grid voltage support is achieved\nutilizing the reactive power injection of ST in [19]. The BESS\nis integrated to the LVDC link of ST and used for peak\nload shaving operation [20], and MV and LV voltage con-\ntrol [21]. However, in [20], the BESS charging/discharging\nefﬁciency analysis is carried out with an ST based system.\nIn addition, the BESS is used to support LV loads of ST\nduring MV grid voltage sags. Moreover, no investigation is\ncarried out for improving the performance of the MV grid.\nThe ST integrated with BESS has the capability for ﬂexible\nactive and reactive power exchange with the MV grid. This\npotential is not explored in the literature for improving the\nTABLE 1. System parameters.\nhosting capability of distribution system. This paper proposes\na method to enhance the hosting capability of a 5-bus radial\ndistribution system using the power management features of\nBESS integrated ST. A detailed study is carried out using\nsensitivity analysis to arrive at the appropriate rating of ST\nand BESS power converters.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. Section II\ndescribes the system conﬁguration and sensitivity analy-\nsis. A sensitivity-based converter sizing method is provided\nfor load increase in Section III and generation increase in\nSection IV . Principle of operation of power converters is\ndescribed in Section V . The simulation results is explained in\nSection VI. The experimental analysis is given in Section VII.\nSection VIII provides the conclusions of the paper.\nII. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\nAND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nIn the ﬁrst part of this section, the conventional and pro-\nposed radial distribution system structures are explained. In\nthe second part, an introduction to the sensitivity analysis is\nprovided.\nA. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\nFig. 1(a) shows the single-line diagram of an 11-kV (L-L),\n5-bus, radial distribution feeder derived from [18]. The R/X\nratio of the distribution system is considered to be 0.85 [22]\nwith Weasel conductor and other parameters are given in\nTable 1. In each bus, loads and DG are connected through\n11/0.4 kV CPT. The uniform variation of loads and gen-\neration at all buses are considered in this paper to analyze\nthe extreme voltage drop/rise scenarios [8], [23]–[25]. The\n72412 VOLUME 8, 2020\nHrishikesan V. M.et al.: Capacity Enhancement of a Radial Distribution Grid Using Smart Transformer\nFIGURE 2. The three-stage topology of ST.\nloads are considered at a power factor of 0.95 lagging, and\ngeneration is considered at the unity power factor [8].\nFig. 1(b) shows the proposed modiﬁed distribution system.\nIn this conﬁguration, the CPTs at bus-4 is replaced with an\nST. In this paper, a three-stage ST topology, as shown in Fig. 2\nis used due to its advantages over the other ST conﬁgurations\n[10], [26]. This conﬁguration consists of an ST MV converter,\nwhich is a three-level neutral point clamped ac-dc converter\nfor connecting MV AC to MVDC as the ﬁrst stage [11]. The\nsecond stage is a dual active bridge converter, which connects\nMVDC to the LVDC link [27]. ST LV converter, which is a\ntwo-level, three-phase dc-ac converter for connecting LVDC\nto LV AC is the third stage [28]. The BESS consists of a\ndc-dc converter, which connects the battery to the LVDC\nterminal of ST [29]. The ST LV converter maintains a three-\nphase balanced sinusoidal voltage at the LV AC terminal.\nThe loads and DG4 are connected to the LV AC terminal of\nST. All the circuit parameters remain the same as given in\nTable 1.\nB. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nNewton-Raphson load-ﬂow is carried out for the system\nshown in Fig. 1(b) to determine the voltages at each bus.\nBus-0 is assumed as slack bus, and voltage magnitude is\nconsidered as 1 p.u. At bus-4, ST absorbs only active power\nfrom the grid, and no reactive power is exchanged with the\nMV grid. Sensitivity analysis helps in identifying the effect\nof active and reactive powers on the various bus voltages.\nIn this paper, the sensitivity coefﬁcients are derived from\nJacobian matrix of Newton-Raphson load-ﬂow method. The\nloading on bus-1 to bus-4 is uniformly increased from zero at\nthe constant power factor, and the corresponding bus voltage\nmagnitudes are plotted in Fig. 3. For analyzing the worst\nloading condition, generation at all the buses is considered\nas zero. From Fig. 3, it is observed that the bus-4 experiences\nworst voltage variations. Therefore, the objective of this paper\nis to improve the voltage at bus-4 and thereby improving\nthe load hosting capability. The change in voltage at bus-\n4 is related to different active and reactive powers by the\nFIGURE 3.

SIZING BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nDURING LOAD INCREASE\nThis section consists of four sub-sections. In the ﬁrst part, the\nsystem operating conditions based on the load-ﬂow studies\nare explained, which are the basis for sizing analysis. In the\nother three sub-sections, the sizing of converters involved is\ndetailed using sensitivity studies under three different operat-\ning scenarios. In the ﬁrst method, only reactive power injec-\ntion from ST is considered, and in the second, only active\npower injection is considered. In the third sub-section, the\ncombination of active and reactive power is utilized to attain\nthe desired objective.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 72413\nHrishikesan V. M.et al.: Capacity Enhancement of a Radial Distribution Grid Using Smart Transformer\nA. SYSTEM OPERATING CONDITIONS\nIn the proposed method, the ST integrated with BESS is\ncontrolled to manage the power ﬂow at the MV grid for\nimproving the load hosting capability of the feeder. It can be\nobserved that the maximum active power loading is limited to\napproximately 0.29 p.u. due to the violation of voltage limit\n(0.9 p.u.), and the same is marked in Fig. 3. The steady-state\nvoltage variations in a distribution system are not allowed\nbeyond a maximum of 1.1 p.u. and a minimum of 0.9 p.u.,\nrespectively [30]. Therefore, if the bus-4 voltage is within\nthese limits, the ST is operated in normal operating mode,\nand if the limits are violated, it is operated in voltage con-\ntrol mode. This paper considers active and/or reactive power\ncontrol only at bus-4 using BESS integrated ST. The worst\nbus voltage magnitude considered for analysis in this paper is\n0.85 p.u. Therefore, the maximum load hosting capability that\ncan be achieved is the load corresponding to 0.85 p.u. of bus-\n4 voltage. From Fig. 3, the voltage at bus-4 is 0.85 p.u. when\nthe active power loading on all the buses are 0.41 p.u. The\nrating of converters is decided to improve the voltage during\nthis maximum voltage scenario. For the analysis, losses in the\nconverters are neglected.\nThe ST LV converter supplies the load at the LV AC side\nin bus-4. In all the considered cases, the maximum active\npower loading is 0.41 p.u. at a lagging power factor of 0.95.\nTherefore, the ST LV converter is rated at 0.432. p.u.\nB. ST WITH ONLY REACTIVE POWER SUPPORT\nAT MV GRID\nIn this case, the ST MV converter supports the grid with\nreactive power. No active power exchange is scheduled for\nMV grid support and therefore, BESS is not considered in\nthis analysis. The rating requirements for ST dc-dc converter\nand MV converter are explained below.\n1) ST DC-DC CONVERTER\nThe ST dc-dc converter is required to carry the entire active\npower requirement at the LV AC side. Hence, the rating\n(Pdc−rat ) of this converter for satisfactory operation is,\nPdc−rat =Plv−max . (2)\nThe maximum active power loading (P lv−max ) at the ST LV\nconverter is 0.41 p.u.; therefore the dc-dc converter rating is\nconsidered as 0.41 p.u.\n2) ST MV CONVERTER\nST MV converter is rated such that it supplies the reactive\npower required at the MV side to maintain the bus-4 steady-\nstate voltage at 0.9 p.u. This converter should also supply\nthe maximum active power requirement at the LV AC side.\nPmv−rat is the active power rating of ST MV converter for\na maximum LV AC load of Plv−max . Therefore,\nPmv−rat =Plv−max . (3)\nThe ST’s reactive power capability is utilized to maintain the\nrequired steady-state voltage, and no active power exchange\nis considered for the grid support. Modifying (1) based on\nthese considerations,\n1|Vb4|= ∂|Vb4|\n∂Qb4\n1Qb4 (4)\nwhere ∂|Vb4|\n∂Qb4\nis the sensitivity of bus-4 voltage for its reactive\npower change in p.u./p.u. The maximum voltage magnitude\ndeviation that needs to be mitigated is 1|Vb4−max |. The\nreactive power change ( 1Qb4−max ) required at MV grid is\ncomputed as,\n1Qb4−max =1|Vb4−max |\n∂|Vb4−max |\n∂Qb4−max\n(5)\nwhere ∂|Vb4−max |\n∂Qb4−max\nis the voltage sensitivity at the corresponding\nmaximum loading. 1Qb4−max is the reactive power required\nfrom the ST to maintain the voltage at required value.\nThe power rating requirements are calculated to improve\nthe voltage to 0.9 p.u. at a maximum active power load-\ning of 0.41 p.u. From the load-ﬂow studies, the sensitivity\nof reactive power at the maximum active power loading\n(0.41 p.u.) is found to be 0.1471 p.u./p.u. The maximum volt-\nage deviation that needs to be mitigated is 0.05 p.u. Therefore\nfrom (5), the reactive power required to mitigate this voltage\ndeviation is,\n1Qb4−max = 0.05\n0.1471 =0.34 p.u. (6)\nFrom (3) and (6), the active and reactive power capacity\nrequired by the ST MV converter are,\nPmv−rat =0.41 p.u.; Qmv−rat =0.34 p.u. (7)\nFrom (7), the rating of ST MV converter is 0.53 p.u.\nC. ST WITH ONLY ACTIVE POWER SUPPORT AT MV GRID\nIn this case, the active power supply from BESS is consid-\nered for improving the load hosting capability. The ST MV\nconverter reactive power injection is not considered for the\nanalysis. The rating requirements for BESS converter, ST dc-\ndc converter and MV converter are explained below.\n1) BESS CONVERTER\nWhen the bus-4 MV voltage limit is violated due to higher\nloading, active power from BESS is supplied to maintain the\nvoltage magnitude within the steady-state limit. Modifying\n(1) based on these considerations,\n1|Vb4|= ∂|Vb4|\n∂Pb4\n1Pb4 (8)\nwhere ∂|Vb4|\n∂Pb4\nis the sensitivity of bus-4 voltage for its active\npower change in p.u./p.u.\nSimilar to the (5), the active power requirement\n(1Pb4−max ) is computed as follows:\n1Pb4−max =1|Vb4−max |\n∂|Vb4−max |\n∂Pb4−max\n(9)\n72414 VOLUME 8, 2020\nHrishikesan V. M.et al.: Capacity Enhancement of a Radial Distribution Grid Using Smart Transformer\nTABLE 2. Comparison of ratings of converters with different power control methods using ST during load increase.\nwhere ∂|Vb4−max |\n∂Pb4−max\nis the voltage sensitivity at the correspond-\ning maximum loading. Therefore, the BESS converter rating\nrequired to achieve the speciﬁed magnitude of voltage is\ngiven by 1Pb4−max .\nConsider the maximum voltage deviation of 0.05 p.u. sim-\nilar to the previous case of analysis. The sensitivity fac-\ntor corresponding to the maximum loading, ∂|Vb4−max |\n∂Pb4−max\n=\n0.1520 p.u./p.u. Substituting the values in (9), the BESS\nrating is obtained as,\n1Pb4−max = 0.05\n0.1520 =0.329 p.u. (10)\nTherefore, the BESS rating of 0.329 p.u. is required at bus-\n4 to improve the load hosting capability of system from\n0.29 p.u. to 0.41 p.u. at all the four buses.\n2) ST DC-DC CONVERTER\nWhen steady-state voltage is within the limit, the ST dc-dc\nconverter should maintain the active power ﬂow from MV\ngrid and the maximum active power loading considered in this\ncase is 0.29 p.u. Therefore, the rating of the dc-dc converter\nin this condition is selected as 0.29 p.u.\n3) ST MV CONVERTER\nThe ST MV converter active power requirement is calculated\nboth in normal and voltage control modes of operation. The\nhigher value is selected as the rating of the converter for this\ncase of analysis. When the bus-4 voltage is within the steady-\nstate limit, the ST MV converter supplies the active power\nrequirement at the LV AC side and BESS. The active power\nrequirement is 0.29 p.u. When the bus-4 voltage exceeds\nthe steady-state limit, the ST MV converter active power\nrequirement for a BESS power supply of Pb is\nPmv−rat =Plv−max −Pb. (11)\nThe BESS supplies 0.329 p.u. of active power to improve the\nsteady-state voltage at the bus-4. The active power require-\nment from ST MV converter is 0.081 p.u. for a maximum load\nof 0.41 p.u. Since the reactive power injection is not consid-\nered in this analysis, the ST MV converter rating requirement\nis 0.29 p.u.\nD. ST WITH BOTH ACTIVE AND REACTIVE POWER\nSUPPORT AT MV GRID\nIn this section, the active power supply from the BESS is\nutilized along with the reactive power capability of ST MV\nconverter to mitigate the steady-state voltage drop. The rating\nrequirements for BESS converter, ST dc-dc converter and MV\nconverter is explained below.\n1) BESS CONVERTER\nModifying (1) by incorporating bus-4 active and reactive\npower control\n1|Vb4|= ∂|Vb4|\n∂Pb4\n1Pb4 +∂|Vb4|\n∂Qb4\n1Qb4. (12)\nIn this analysis, as a generalized case, the active and\nreactive power contributions are considered equal. All other\ncombinations of active and reactive power injections are also\npossible with the ST. Based on the equal active and reactive\npower contribution, (12) can be modiﬁed to,\n1|Vb4−max |= (∂|Vb4−max |\n∂Pb4−max\n+∂|Vb4−max |\n∂Qb4−max\n)1Pb4−max .\n(13)\nCalculating the BESS size with the ST active and reactive\npower contribution,\n1Pb4−max =1Qb4−max = 0.05\n0.1520 +0.1471\n=0.167 p.u. (14)\nThe BESS converter size required for achieving improved\nload hosting capability is reduced to 0.167 p.u. after the\nincorporation of ST MV reactive power control.\n2) ST DC-DC CONVERTER\nThe rating of ST dc-dc converter remain same as the previous\ncase since during normal operating condition, this converter\nneed to supply LV AC active power load. The rating of dc-dc\nconverter in this condition is selected as 0.29 p.u.\n3) ST MV CONVERTER\nDuring the normal operating mode, the ST MV converter\nsupplies the active power requirement at the LV AC side and\nBESS. The active power requirement is 0.29 p.u. During the\nvoltage control mode, the active power required from the ST\nMV converter is as per (11). The BESS supplies 0.167 p.u. of\nactive power to improve the steady-state voltage at the bus-\n4. The active power requirement from ST MV converter is\n0.243 p.u. for a maximum load of 0.41 p.u. Since the reactive\npower injection is calculated as 0.167 p.u., in this strategy,\nthe ST MV converter rating requirement is 0.295 p.u. The\nratings of different power converters obtained from the above\nanalysis is given in Table 2.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 72415\nHrishikesan V. M.et al.: Capacity Enhancement of a Radial Distribution Grid Using Smart Transformer\nFIGURE 4. Variation of bus voltage magnitudes with uniform increase in\ngeneration.\nIV. SIZING BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS DURING\nGENERATION INCREASE\nIn this section, the sizing analysis is brieﬂy analyzed when\nthe generation is increased along the feeder. Newton-Raphson\nload-ﬂow is carried out for the system shown in Fig. 1(b)\nto determine the voltages at each bus. Bus-0 is assumed as\nslack bus, and voltage magnitude is considered as 1 p.u. In\nthis case, the generation at each bus is increased uniformly\nand the reverse power ﬂow condition is analyzed. Due to\nreverse power ﬂow along the feeder, the voltages increases\nin different buses and Fig. 4 shows the variation of voltages\nat different buses when generation is increased from zero.\nFor analyzing the worst voltage rise phenomenon, the loading\nat all the buses is assumed as zero. From Fig. 4, it can\nbe observed that the maximum active power generation is\nlimited approximately to 0.46 p.u. due to the violation of\nthe upper voltage limit (1.1 p.u.), and the same is marked\nin the plot. The STs’ capability to improve the load hosting\ncapability can also be utilized for increasing DG penetra-\ntion. The sensitivity study explained in case of load host-\ning capability improvement is repeated for the generation\nincrease.\nAs seen in Fig. 4, the bus-4 experiences the worst voltage\nmagnitude rise due to increased generation. The worst bus\nvoltage magnitude considered for analysis in this paper is\n1.125 p.u. Therefore, the maximum DG hosting capabil-\nity that can be achieved is the generation corresponding to\n1.125 p.u. of bus-4 voltage. From Fig. 4, the voltage at bus-4\nis 1.125 p.u. when the active power generation on all the buses\nis 0.59 p.u. This condition is considered to decide the size of\ndifferent converters. The sensitivity-based sizing is explained\nfor the load increase case, and the same methods are repeated\nfor generation increase. The essential ﬁndings related to the\nratings of different converters are tabulated in Table 3.\nThe third scenario shown in the above analysis considers\nthe equal contribution of active and reactive power injection.\nHowever, the ST is capable of operating at other combinations\nof active and reactive powers to improve the voltage at bus-4.\nIn another way, this ﬂexible active, reactive power injection\nshows the multiple power factor operation capability of ST\nfor achieving the same objective.\nV. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION OF CONVERTERS\nIn this section, the principle of operation and control of ST\nMV converter, ST dc-dc converter, ST LV converter and\nBESS converter is explained. Fig. 5(a) shows the overall\ncontrol diagram of ST. The control of converters are explained\nfor load increase case.\nA. ST MV CONVERTER\nDuring the normal operating condition, ST MV converter\nsupplies the active power requirement at the LV AC side and\nBESS charging power requirement in all the three strategies.\nThe ST MV converter active power requirement is given by,\nP∗\nstmv =Pb4l +P∗\nbess (15)\nwhere Pb4l is the active power loading at the ST LV AC\nside and P∗\nbess is the BESS charging power reference. No\nexchange of reactive power is considered at this condition,\nand the reactive power reference (Q ∗\nstmv) is zero. Therefore,\nST operates in unity power factor during normal operating\ncondition.\nIn the voltage control mode, depending upon the strategy\nadopted for capacity enhancement, active and/or reactive\npower references are generated. The ST MV converter active\nand reactive power reference generation strategy is explained\nas follows:\nConsidering a steady-state voltage drop condition, for a\nspeciﬁed lower limit of voltage magnitude Vb4−ll, and bus-4\nvoltage magnitude of Vb4, the ST MV active power reference\nis given by,\nP∗\nstmv =Pb4l +Spd (Vb4 −Vb4−ll) (16)\nwhere Spd is the slope factor for active power (p.u./p.u.). The\nST MV converter reactive power reference is given by,\nQ∗\nstmv =0 +Sqd (Vb4 −Vb4−ll) (17)\nTABLE 3.

Simulation parameters.\nwhere Sqd is the slope factor for reactive power (p.u./p.u.).\nDepending upon the strategy adopted for voltage control,\nactive/reactive power independently or a combination of both\nis utilized for voltage control. The calculation of slope factors\nfor a simultaneous active and reactive power injection strat-\negy is explained as follows:\nThe BESS capacity required for the voltage drop of\n0.05 p.u. beyond the lower limit is calculated in (14) and max-\nimum BESS power required for the mitigation of this voltage\ndrop is 0.167 p.u. Therefore, the BESS power required for a\n1 p.u. voltage change, Spd is given by,\nSpd = 1Pb4−max\n1|Vb4−max |= 1\n(∂|Vb4−max |\n∂Pb4−max\n+∂|Vb4−max |\n∂Qb4−max\n)\n=0.167\n0.05 =3.34 p.u/p.u. (18)\nTABLE 5. Simulation PI controller parameters.\nAs considered in (13), the active and reactive power contri-\nbution from ST are equal. Therefore the reactive power slope\nfactor is given by,\nSqd =3.34 p.u/p.u. (19)\nSimilarly, the slope factors for only active or reactive power\ninjection strategy can be computed. The active and the\nreactive power references are generated using the above-\nmentioned strategies and provided as inputs to the inner\ncontrollers explained in the next part of this section.\nThree-phase bus-4 voltages (v b4) and ST MV converter\ncurrents (i mvac) are converted to its d and q components\nvbd4, vbq4 and idmv, iqmv, respectively. The outer controller\ngenerates the active (P ∗\nstmv) and the reactive (Q ∗\nstmv) power\nreferences based on different control modes explained in\nthe previous section. The MVDC link voltage (V mvdc) is\nVOLUME 8, 2020 72417\nHrishikesan V. M.et al.: Capacity Enhancement of a Radial Distribution Grid Using Smart Transformer\nFIGURE 6.

(20)\nThe d component of current reference (i ∗\ndmvr ) is added\nwith the MVDC link loss component to generate total current\nreference of i∗\ndmv. The q component of reference current\n(i∗\nqmv) is generated directly from (20). The three-phase voltage\nreferences (v ∗\nmvac) for ST MV converter are generated from\nthe above current references using voltage oriented current\ncontrol as shown in Fig. 5(b) [31].\nB. ST DC-DC CONVERTER\nThe primary function of this converter is to maintain the\nLVDC voltage at a constant value and thereby ensuring a\nconstant power ﬂow between MVDC and LVDC links of\nST. The LVDC voltage (V lvdc) is compared with a reference\nvalue (V ∗\nlvdc) and the error is passed through a PI controller\nto generate the phase angle which is maintained between\nFIGURE 7.

ST LV CONVERTER\nThe ST LV converter is controlled as a grid forming voltage\nsource converter. The converter maintains the reference value\nof rms phase voltage (V ∗\nlv) at 50 Hz frequency and 120 ◦phase\ndifference between phases to generate three-phase balanced\nsinusoidal voltage at the LV AC side [22]. Fig. 5(d) shows the\nreference generation block-diagram.\nD. BESS DC-DC CONVERTER\nIn Fig. 5(e), the reference power (P ∗\nbess) generation for BESS\nconverter is shown. During the normal grid operating condi-\ntions, the active power exchange with the MV AC grid main-\ntains the appropriate state of charge (SoC). The BESS current\nreference (I ∗\nbess) is given by,\nI∗\nbess =P∗\nbess\nVbess\n(21)\nwhere Vbess is the voltage across the battery.\nDuring voltage control mode of ST and if the voltage is\ndropped beyond the lower limit, the BESS is activated to\nsupply the active power requirement calculated based on the\n72418 VOLUME 8, 2020\nHrishikesan V.

SIMULATION RESULTS\nThe simulation study is carried out in the PSCAD environ-\nment. The system parameters used for simulation studies\nare given in Table 1, Table 4, and Table 5. Loading on all\nthe four buses are considered to be uniform throughout the\nsimulation study at a constant lagging power factor of 0.95.\nThe ST is installed at the bus-4, and the active power load\nhosting capability of each bus is limited to 0.29 p.u. due to\nthe violation of steady-state voltage limit (0.9 p.u.) at bus-4\nas obtained from the load-ﬂow studies. The aim is to improve\nthe active power load hosting capability to 0.41 p.u., which\ncorresponds to 0.85 p.u. of voltage at bus-4 without any\nactive/reactive power support from ST. The active/reactive\npower requirement from ST in different control strategies\nis explained in the above section, and the simulation results\nFIGURE 9.

PERFORMANCE OF SYSTEM WITH ONLY REACTIVE\nPOWER SUPPORT FROM ST\nThis case analyzes the performance of the system when ST\nMV converter injects only reactive power to the MV grid\nwhen load increases beyond the critical steady-state load\n(0.29 p.u.). Fig. 6 shows the simulation results for this case.\nTill t =10 s, the active power loading in all the buses are\n0.29 p.u. Fig. 6(a) shows the bus-4 voltage, and the magnitude\nis at the steady-state limit of 0.9 p.u. ST MV converter absorbs\nthe active power requirement at the LV AC side, Fig. 6(b)\nshows the currents. ST LV converter maintains a 1 p.u. of\nvoltage at the LV side and shown in Fig. 6(c). ST LV converter\nsupplies the active and reactive power requirement of LV\nloads, and the currents are shown in Fig. 6(d). Fig. 6(e) shows\nthe load active and reactive powers. Fig. 6(f) shows ST MV\nconverter active, reactive powers, and BESS power. At t =10\ns, the load at all buses is increased to 0.41 p.u. The ST injects\nreactive power to the MV grid and the voltage at the bus-4\nis maintained at 0.9 p.u. as shown in the Fig. 6(a). Fig. 6(e)\nshows the active and reactive power increase at the bus-4.

Experimental parameters.\npower injection also increases to supply the additional load at\nthe LV AC side. BESS is not involved in this case of analysis,\nand BESS power remains at zero.\nB. PERFORMANCE OF SYSTEM WITH ONLY ACTIVE\nPOWER SUPPORT FROM ST\nThis case analyzes the performance of the system when ST\nutilizes active power from BESS to the MV grid when the load\nincreases beyond the critical steady-state load (0.29 p.u.).\nFig. 7 shows the simulation results for this case. The loading\nin all the buses increases at t =10 s. Fig. 7(a) shows the\nbus-4 voltage, and the magnitude is at the steady-state limit\nof 0.9 p.u. Fig. 7(b) shows the ST MV converter currents.\nFig. 7(c) and Fig. 7(d) show ST LV AC voltages and currents.\nFig. 7(e) shows the load active and reactive powers, and the\nload increase is visible after t =10 s. Fig. 7(f) shows ST\nMV converter active, reactive powers, and BESS power. After\nt =10 s, the BESS injects active power to the MV grid, and\nthe voltage at the bus-4 are maintained at 0.9 p.u. as shown\nin the Fig. 7(a). In Fig. 7(f), the active power injection from\nBESS is visible, and active power absorption from ST MV\nconverter decreases due to BESS injection. ST reactive power\nis not involved in this case of analysis.\nC. PERFORMANCE OF SYSTEM WITH BOTH ACTIVE AND\nREACTIVE POWER SUPPORT FROM ST\nThis case analyzes the performance of the system when ST\nutilizes active power from the BESS and reactive power\ncapability of the ST MV converter to improve the load host-\ning capability. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 8\nand Fig. 9. Fig. 8 shows the results when the active and\nreactive power contributions are considered equal. The load\nincreases similar to the previous cases. Fig. 8(a) shows the\nbus-4 voltage and the magnitude is at the steady-state limit\nof 0.9 p.u. Fig. 8(b) shows the ST MV converter currents.\nST LV AC voltages and currents are shown in Fig. 8(c) and\nFig. 8(d), respectively. Load increases after t = 10 s and\nFig. 8(e) shows the load active and reactive powers. ST\nMV converter active, reactive powers, and BESS power are\nshown in Fig. 8(f). The active and reactive power required to\nmaintain the steady-state voltage at 0.9 p.u. is calculated from\nthe sensitivity study, and the same is shown in Fig. 8(f).\nIn another case shown in Fig. 9, an unequal contribution of\nactive and reactive power is experimented. Here the reactive\npower contribution is considered as two times that of active\npower to obtain the required voltage support at the bus-4. All\nother conditions remain same. Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 9(b) show\nthe bus-4 voltage and ST MV converter currents, respectively.\nThe voltage magnitude remains the same at the steady-state\nlimit of 0.9 p.u. after the load change at t =10 s. ST LV AC\nvoltages and currents are shown in Fig. 9(c) and Fig. 9(d),\nrespectively. Fig. 9(e) shows the load active and reactive\npowers. ST MV converter active, reactive powers, and BESS\npower are shown in Fig. 9(f). The active and reactive power\nrequired to maintain the steady-state voltage at 0.9 p.u. is\ncalculated from the sensitivity study maintaining the ratio of\ntheir contribution.\nVII. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS\nThe experiment is conducted in a simpliﬁed laboratory setup.\nFig. 10(a) shows the experimental setup conﬁguration. The\nST MV and LV converters are realized using ac-dc convert-\ners. The operation of BESS is realized using a third ac-dc\nconverter whose ac side is connected to another ac grid and\nthe dc side is connected to the ST dc link. Fig. 10(b) shows\nthe photograph. The experimental parameters are given in\nTable 6. The system shown in Fig. 1(b) is simpliﬁed to the\nFig. 10(a) conﬁguration.

The grid voltage contains harmonics, and the\npresent work does not consider any strategies to mitigate\nthat problem. The system is considered to be operating at\nthe limiting load, which corresponds to 90% of the nominal\nvoltage at PCC. The load is increased to a value which leads\nthe voltage to decrease to 85% of the nominal value without\nany control. Three cases are experimented in this paper. In\nall the three cases, ST is controlled to improve the voltage at\nPCC to the maximum allowed limit, i.e., 90% of the nominal\nvalue.\nIn the ﬁrst case, the voltage reduction due to load increase\nis compensated with the reactive power capability of ST MV\nconverter. The experimental waveforms are shown in Fig. 11.\nFig. 11(a) shows the PCC voltages, which is maintained\nat the grid-code speciﬁed limiting value. The load increase\nis marked in the waveform. Fig. 11(b) shows the ST MV\ncurrents, and it increases after load change due to increased\nactive and reactive power exchange. Fig. 11(c) shows the\nST LV voltages which are maintained at the nominal value.\nThe load increase is visible from the increase in LV side\ncurrents, as shown in Fig. 11(d). The dc-link voltage is shown\nin Fig. 11(e), which remains constant. The MV side active\nFIGURE 12. ST supports the grid with active power during load change.\n(a) MV side PCC voltages.

The ST absorbs more power\nto supply the increased loads. Fig. 11(g) shows the reactive\npower supplied for maintaining the voltage. Fig. 11(h) shows\nthe BESS power, which is maintained at zero in this case of\nexperiment.\nIn the second case, the active power supply from BESS is\nused to compensate for the voltage reduction due to increased\nload requirement, and the waveforms are shown in Fig. 12.\nFig. 12(a)-(e) show the waveforms of PCC voltages, ST MV\ncurrents, ST LV voltages, ST LV load currents, and DC link\nvoltage, respectively. The load increase is compensated with\nthe BESS active power and Fig. 12(f) shows the ST MV\nactive power, which remains at the previous value after load\nincrease. No reactive power is exchanged with the grid and\nFig. 12(g) shows the ST MV reactive power. Fig. 12(h) shows\nthe BESS power, which is required to maintain the voltage at\nMV grid.\nIn the third case, simultaneous active and reactive powers\nfrom ST are used to compensate for the voltage reduction\ndue to increased load requirement, and the waveforms are\nshown in Fig. 13.
