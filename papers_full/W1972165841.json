In these situa-\ntions, mineral-oil-based dielectric insulating ﬂuids have shown\ncostly limitations. Mineral-oil-ﬁlled transformer explosions and\nﬁres causing heavy collateral damage have raised major safety\nconcerns. There have also been major environmental concerns\nover the toxic effects of uncontained mineral oil spills. This\nhas given rise to a new class of alternative dielectric insulating\nﬂuids that have historically been developed to answer these\nspeciﬁc concerns.\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were used in transformers\nas dielectric insulating ﬂuids to solve the problem of high\nﬂammability for installations in and near buildings. As their\nnegative aspects began to be fully appreciated (high toxicity),\nother ﬂuids such as silicone oils, high-temperature hydrocar-\nbons, tetrachloroethylenes, and synthetic esters started to be\nused in transformers located in many of the locations where\nPCBs were formerly used. These ﬂuids possessed superior\nﬁre resistance properties compared to mineral oils, although\nthey were not as ﬁre resistant as PCBs with the exception\nmaybe of tetrachloroethylenes. They did not, however, with\nthe possible exception of synthetic esters, possess biodegrad-\nability characteristics that were markedly superior to mineral\noils. In the late 1990s, natural esters, a new class of fully\nbiodegradable dielectric insulating ﬂuids, were developed for\ntransformer applications. These vegetable-oil-based ﬂuids meet\nall the requirements for a high-temperature insulating ﬂuid\nwith the addition of being manufactured from renewable raw\nmaterials.\nThere are, today, a number of published industry standards\nand guides that cover the use of natural ester ﬂuids in trans-\nformer applications, such as the American Society for Testing\nand Materials standard D6871 and the IEEE guide C57.147 in\nNorth America, the Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas\nstandard NBR 15422 in Brazil, and, most recently, the Cigré\nBrochure 436 and the IEC Standard 62770.\nII. N\nATURAL ESTER DIELECTRIC INSULATING FLUIDS\nA. Development of Electrical-Grade Vegetable-Based Oils\nVegetable-based oils were seriously considered as dielectric\ninsulating ﬂuids for capacitors ﬁrst. Castor and cotton seed oils\nwere mentioned for use in capacitors (with cellulose insulation)\nas early as 1962 [1]. Later on in the 1990s, rapeseed oil became\n0093-9994 © 2013IEEE.

Triglyceride ester molecule.\nTABLE I\nTYPICAL FATTY ACID COMPOSITION OF SOME VEGETABLE OILS\nanother center of interest for use in capacitors [2]. Triggered\nby major utilities spending millions annually on cleaning up\nmineral oil spills and leaks from transformers, it is during the\nsame decade that research efforts were started to develop fully\nbiodegradable dielectric insulating ﬂuids based on vegetable\noils for use in transformers [3].\nResearch works soon demonstrated that vegetable oils\nneeded further improvement to be used as transformer oil.\nTransformer oils remain in the unit for many years (as many\nas 30–40 years). Only in the larger power transformer units is\nthe oil periodically changed or reclaimed. Long-term stability\nis therefore of critical importance, and vegetable oils have\ninherently components that degrade in a relatively short time.\nB. Long-Term Stability, A Key Factor\nCrude vegetable oils extracted from oil seeds contain solid\nconstituents such as proteins and ﬁbers, and liquid (fats and oil).\nBoth fats and oil are triglyceride esters of fatty acids (Fig. 1),\nbut fats contain a relatively high percentage of saturated triglyc-\nerides and would solidify below room temperature. Oil usually\nremains as liquid above 0\n◦C (oils with high unsaturation may\nremain as liquid at−15 ◦Ct o−30 ◦C). Table I lists the typical\nfatty acid composition of some vegetable oils [4].\nThe degree of unsaturation of the triglyceride ester molecule\nor fatty acid chains is an indicator of stability to heat, oxidation,\nand light degradation of the oil (the higher the degree of\nunsaturation from mono- to triunsaturation, the more unstable).\nThe relative instability to oxidation is roughly 1:10:100:200\nfor saturated, mono-, di-, and triunsaturated C-18 triglyceride,\nrespectively [5]. In that respect, the high oleic sunﬂower oil\nFig. 2. IEC 61125 oxidation stability test results at 120◦C.\nprovides the best stability with a monounsaturated level of\nabove 80% (even though very stable, fully saturated fatty acids\neasily solidify and are therefore here not desirable).\nOxidation stability tests have been run at 120\n◦C on different\ncommercially available natural ester dielectric insulating ﬂuids\nusing the standard test method IEC 61125. The three natural\nester ﬂuids tested mainly differentiate themselves in the content\nof monounsaturated or oleic fatty acids, i.e., above 75% for\na high oleic sunﬂower-based product, between 50% and 75%\nfor a mid-oleic rapeseed-based product, and below 30% for\na low oleic soybean-based product. The three natural esters\nwere compared to a synthetic ester ﬂuid which is known for\nits greater stability. The change of viscosity of the ﬂuid during\nthe test is a good indication of its degradation. Fig. 2 shows the\nresults obtained over a test duration of 96 h or 4 days.\nWhile the high oleic natural ester showed no degradation,\nboth the mid- and low oleic natural esters showed sign of\nmarked degradation at a very early stage already, with the\nlow oleic product irreversibly polymerizing eventually. These\nresults were further corroborated by visual inspection, infrared\n(IR) spectroscopy analysis, and oxidative induction time mea-\nsurements [6].\nIn transformers, the presence of copper enhances the ten-\ndency for oxidation. Oxidation inhibitors are therefore needed\nfor the oils used in transformers. Another factor is the purity of\nthe oil. The oil has to be free of conducting ionic impurities to\nacceptable levels, and food-grade vegetable oils are not of this\npurity.\nC. Main Characteristics\n1) Preserving the Environment:Natural ester ﬂuids are now\nrecognized by the industry as the environmentally friendly\ndielectric insulating ﬂuid of choice. By nature, these ﬂuids are\nnontoxic and readily biodegradable (Fig. 3). Such properties\nhave been veriﬁed and approved by the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency through their Environmental Technology\nVeriﬁcation program [7]. Natural ester ﬂuids are also classiﬁed\nas nonhazardous to water by the German Federal Environmen-\ntal Agency (Umweltbundesamt) [8].\n136 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS, VOL. 50, NO. 1, JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2014\nFig. 3. Twenty-one-day aquatic biodegradability test results.\nThis environmental friendliness of natural esters may lead to\nsubstantial beneﬁts for the transformer end user. For instance,\nwhen such ﬂuids are used, FM Global1 allows a much larger\noil volume before containment is required and a much smaller\ncontainment when required in some installations [9]. Although\nlocal laws and regulations are still applicable, spills of natural\nesters can be disposed through normal means since they are\nnot characterized as hazardous waste. This can also lead to\npotential relief from local environmental regulatory penalties\n(soil contamination mitigation after spills).\nIn addition, natural esters have a near neutral carbon footprint\ndue to the negative carbon footprint of a vegetable oil produc-\ntion. The by-products of natural esters after combustion are also\nmuch less toxic than the ones of mineral oils, which further\nminimizes their overall impact on the environment.\n2) Preserving Life and Properties:Natural ester ﬂuids have\na ﬂash and ﬁre point above 300\n◦C (versus 160 ◦C–180 ◦C\ntypically for mineral oil). As such, they meet the U.S. National\nElectric Code deﬁnition of and are listed as “less ﬂammable”\ndielectric ﬂuids by both FM Global and Underwriters Labo-\nratories\n2 (UL). They are also classiﬁed as K-ﬁre-hazard-class\ndielectric insulating ﬂuids as per the IEC Standard 61100 [8].\nConsequently, natural-ester-ﬁlled transformers meet ﬁre\nsafety requirements for indoor applications and outdoor ar-\neas of heightened safety sensitivity without additional safety\nequipment. According to FM Global, for example, active ﬁre\nsuppression and barrier walls can essentially be eliminated\nwhen minimal spacing is maintained between the different\nequipment (for transformers with ratings 10 MV A and lower)\n[9]. This, again, can lead to nonnegligible savings on initial\ninstallation costs as well as rehabilitation and maintenance costs\nfor the transformer end user.\nOverall, natural ester ﬂuids greatly reduce the risk of trans-\nformer ﬁre and explosion, hence greatly mitigating collateral\ndamage of such dramatic events and potentially lowering insur-\nance premiums. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, which displays the\nresults of high-energy arcing faults simulated in pole-mounted\ndistribution transformer tanks using pointed conically shaped\nrods as electrodes.\n1FM Global is a global insurance company for commercial and industrial\nproperties.\n2UL is a global independent safety science company.\nFig. 4. High-energy arcing fault test results with (a) mineral oil and (b) a high\noleic sunﬂower-based dielectric insulating ﬂuid.\nA current source was used to supply up to 8000 A through\na short circuit across the electrodes for up to three cycles. At\nthe highest energy level, the lid of the mineral-oil-ﬁlled setup\nblew apart, and a ﬁre started after the hot oil was exposed to the\natmosphere [Fig. 4(a)]. In the corresponding test with a high\noleic sunﬂower-based dielectric insulating ﬂuid, the lid simply\nvented, and a small amount of carbonized and vaporized oil\nspewed out of the tank; however, there was no ﬁre [Fig. 4(b)].\n3) Enhancing Performance: Natural ester ﬂuids are also\nhydrophilic (water-loving substances) by nature and have a\nwater saturation limit of ﬁve to eight times greater than that of\nmineral oil at normal transformer operating conditions (Fig. 5).\nTesting has shown, however, that, even at a level of 500-ppm\nmoisture content in the oil, the dielectric breakdown strength\nof natural esters is still within the standard limits. Because of\nthe natural esters’ greater water saturation limit, less moisture\nis held into the cellulose insulation materials (water moves\nbetween cellulose and oil to reach the same relative saturation\nin each material). The result of this lower moisture content\nin the insulation paper is a reduction in its degradation rate\nover time by up to a factor of four as compared to standard\nASANO AND PAGE: REDUCING IMPACT AND IMPROVING SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE OF POWER TRANSFORMERS 137\nFig. 5. Water solubility test results as a function of temperature.\nFig. 6. Arrhenius life plot according to IEEE guide C57.91.\nmineral-oil-impregnated paper [10]. The chemical reaction of\nwater generated during the cellulose aging process with natural\nesters (hydrolysis) producing free fatty acids and a change\nin the cellulose structure through another chemical reaction\nwith these free fatty acids (transesteriﬁcation) have shown to\nalso contribute to improve the life performance of cellulose\ninsulation when aged in natural esters [11].\nThese phenomena can lead to either a life extension of the in-\nsulation system at normal operating conditions or, alternatively,\nto the ability of operating the transformer at a 20\n◦C higher hot-\nspot temperature while maintaining the same life expectancy\nthan that of an equivalent mineral-oil-ﬁlled transformer operat-\ning at normal conditions (Fig. 6).\nSeveral actual references illustrating the beneﬁts of the\nhigher thermal capability of cellulose paper immersed in natural\nester ﬂuids are given in the next section.\nIII. P\nRACTICAL EXAMPLES\nThere are several applications where energy utility and pro-\ncess industry asset managers have opted for a natural ester\nﬂuid in substitution to mineral oil in their transformers. From\nenvironmental impact to insulation life extension, some of the\nmost common applications of natural ester ﬂuids are reported\nas follows.\nFig. 7. 138-kV compact mobile substation ﬁlled with a high oleic sunﬂower-\nbased dielectric insulating ﬂuid.\nA. Additional Power and Overloadability\nIn [10], the authors presented a survey of several tests\nperformed by different research laboratories worldwide and\ncomparing the aging behavior of cellulose immersed in mineral\noil and in natural ester ﬂuids.\nThis survey shows that higher temperatures and temperature\nrise limits can be allowed with transformers ﬁlled with natural\nester ﬂuids when compared to similar transformers ﬁlled with\nmineral oil.\nWhen designing a new transformer, this increase in temper-\nature limits can be translated in either increase in power rating\nor a more compact transformer.\nThe ultimate approach that is to reduce the transformer\nfootprint in a substation would also imply the use of a high-\ntemperature insulation material. By using the latter in combina-\ntion with natural ester ﬂuid, the authors in [12] have resolved\ntheir customer space limitation and capacity expansion require-\nments by designing a 40/50-MV A (KNAN/KNAF) transformer\nwith the same physical dimensions as the original 20/30-MV A\n(ONAN/ONAF) unit, while in [13], the authors reported a\npower capacity increase from 15 to 25 MV A using the same\ntransformer tank and core. Those examples illustrate the real\npotential in transformer size reduction (ranging from up to\n50%) when compared to conventional transformer technology.\nAlong the same line, compact mobile substations can also\nbe designed even more compact with less risk when a high-ﬁre-\npoint biodegradable ﬂuid is used and hence transported (Fig. 7).\nB. Life Extension\nAlternatively, the same survey [10] also shows that the\ntransformer cellulose insulation life can be extended. Cellulose\npaper used to insulate the transformer windings is the main\ndetermining factor of the transformer lifetime. It is wrapped\naround the wires where it cannot be easily maintained or\nsubstituted. While in operation, cellulose paper is subject to\nthermal, electrical, and mechanical stresses. The retaining of\nits mechanical strength, which is related to the transformer\ncapacity to withstand strong faults, is the most used parameter\nto monitor the transformer aging state.\nAging of cellulose paper is determined by several factors re-\nlated to the maintenance as well as operation of the transformer.\nConsidering proper maintenance practices, the load proﬁle of\nthe transformer and the resulting temperature proﬁle are the\n138 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS, VOL. 50, NO. 1, JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2014\nFig. 8. 69-kV transformer being prepared for retroﬁlling in the ﬁeld with a\nhigh oleic sunﬂower-based dielectric insulating ﬂuid.\nmost important variables that govern the aging of cellulose\npaper.\nThe Arrhenius relationship shows, for example, that cellulose\nlife can be doubled for every 6◦C–7 ◦C decrease in hot-spot\ntemperature when in the transformer operation range of 80◦C–\n100 ◦C, while such a doubled life rate can range from 5.9◦Ct o\n9.7 ◦C in the 80◦C–180 ◦C range [14]. Therefore, if a natural-\nester-ﬁlled transformer operates at similar temperatures as a\nmineral-oil-ﬁlled unit, the higher thermal capability of cellulose\npaper immersed in natural ester ﬂuids will result in a much\nlower aging rate, i.e., the substitution of mineral oil by a natural\nester can extend the remaining life of an old equipment by more\nthan four times in ideal conditions.\nC. Reduced Risk of Fire\nA ﬁre point above 300\n◦C classiﬁes natural ester ﬂuids as\n“less ﬂammable” dielectric insulating ﬂuids, and IEC identiﬁes\ntransformers ﬁlled with liquids that meet this requirement with\nthe letter K instead of the traditional O in the description of the\ncooling code [15].\nDepending on local regulations, those transformers can be\nused in ﬁre-sensitive areas or have reduced installation require-\nments for ﬁre protection and spill containment. Insurance com-\npanies that make use of engineering risk assessment established\nlower installation requirements when “less ﬂammable” ﬂuids\na r eu s e d[ 9 ] .\nImproved ﬁre safety can be a determining factor to keep old\nsubstations operating according to more modern regulations.\nTherefore, retroﬁlling becomes an interesting option when the\nﬂuid exchange can be performed in the ﬁeld for existing units\n(Fig. 8).\nAlthough natural-ester-ﬂuid unique properties and their im-\nplications in the transformer real life have been presented\nseparately, they are all connected whether it is for a new or\nretroﬁlled unit. In [13], a transformer end user presented how\nthe solution met his original expectation when it comes to\nincreased overload capacity and ﬁre safety, while addressing\nhis concerns about soil and water contamination, for which a\nbiodegradable ﬂuid did certainly contribute positively.\nFig. 9. Dependence of positive streamer velocity on lightning impulse (LI)\novervoltages in needle/plane geometry with an electrode gap distance of 25 mm\nfor mineral oil and ester ﬂuids [17].\nIV . IMPACT IN THE TRANSFORMER DESIGN\nWhile natural-ester-ﬂuid biodegradability, ﬁre behavior, and\ncellulose paper aging characteristic do beneﬁt greatly trans-\nformer end users, designers and manufacturers do have, how-\never, to accommodate for the differences in ﬂuid properties in\ntheir design models and processes.\nA. Oxidation Stability\nThe most important functions of an insulating liquid are\ndielectric insulation and cooling capacity. The development\nof free-breathing transformers in Europe pushed, however, for\nmore and more stringent oxidation stability criteria for mineral\noil [16].\nNatural ester ﬂuids are known to not be as stable as mineral\noil, and therefore, the same standards are generally not accepted\nas references. Free-breathing applications are usually not rec-\nommended for natural ester ﬂuids either.\nThe IEC Standard 62770 for the use of natural ester ﬂuids\nin transformer applications deﬁnes speciﬁc methods and limit\nvalues as well as relevant control parameters when it comes\nto oxidation stability that will allow users to perform the right\nselection among the different natural ester ﬂuids commercially\navailable in that respect.\nB. Dielectric\nIn a needle/plane geometry experimental setup with transient\nvoltages, the breakdown voltage of ester ﬂuids is comparable\nto that of mineral oil at positive polarity and in short gap\ndistances (25 mm). However, at longer distances (100-mm gap),\nthe breakdown voltage of ester ﬂuids is noticeably lower than\nthat of mineral oil [17].\nUsing the same experimental setup, differences can be also\nfound in streamer velocity, acceleration voltage, and transition\nto fast event (Fig. 9).\nThe main factor which governs streamer propagation ve-\nlocity in ester ﬂuids and mineral oil is the amplitude of the\napplied voltage. With increasing voltage, streamer propagation\ncan switch from a slow mode with a velocity of less than 5 km/s\nASANO AND PAGE: REDUCING IMPACT AND IMPROVING SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE OF POWER TRANSFORMERS 139\nto a fast mode with a velocity greater than 10 km/s and up to\nthe order of 100 km/s. The acceleration voltage for transition\nto fast streamer in ester ﬂuids is noticeably lower than that in\nmineral oil [17].\nThe transformer manufacturer must acknowledge the simi-\nlarities and differences in the dielectric behavior of the different\nﬂuids and must address them with proper design rules—as well\nas with design assessment in the case of retroﬁlls. Neglecting\nthose differences increases the risk of dielectric failures during\nthe ﬁnal tests or while in operation. While those differences\ndo impact the design of a new or renewed transformer, once\nthe transformer is designed with the correct rules, the dielectric\nperformance of a transformer ﬁlled with natural ester ﬂuids is\nas good as that of a conventional transformer ﬁlled with mineral\noil, and no additional protection is required.\nC. Viscosity\nViscosity of natural ester ﬂuids is greater than that of mineral\noil and also requires some consideration in the design of a\ntransformer. When compared to mineral oil, the ﬂow of natural\nester ﬂuids through the transformer windings, core, and cooling\nequipment is slower, leading to a relative increase of top oil,\nwindings, and core temperatures. At the same time, natural\nester ﬂuids have higher thermal conductivity and slightly higher\nheat capacity than mineral oil. However, these better thermal\nproperties only slightly compensate for the impact of the higher\nviscosity of natural ester ﬂuids [18].\nViscosity also varies with temperature. The higher the tem-\nperature, the closer the viscosity of natural ester ﬂuids to that\nof mineral oil. At lower temperatures however, the difference\nin viscosity is increasing until the ﬂuids solidify. The pour\npoint of a standard mineral oil is typically lower than−40\n◦C,\nwhile natural-ester-ﬂuid pour point is rather in the range of\n−15\n◦Cd o w nt o−25 ◦C. Despite the fact that natural-ester-\nﬂuid dielectric behavior is not inﬂuenced by the change of state,\nspecial cold start procedures may be required at higher subzero\ntemperatures than for mineral oil.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the increase in viscosity\nobserved in the oxidation process of natural ester ﬂuids can\nbe used to determine the degree of deterioration of the ﬂuid\nwith time. The fatty acid composition of each speciﬁc natural\nester ﬂuid will determine its long-term stability. Depending on\nthe application considered, it may be worth assessing the effect\nof heat, oxygen, and/or light (ultraviolet and IR) on the ﬂuid\nviscosity in order to select the most suitable product.\nD. Temperature Rise Limits\nThe beneﬁt of cellulose paper life extension when aged in\nnatural ester ﬂuids has motivated several researchers to quantify\nand investigate its origin as well as to evaluate its potential in\nthe design and manufacturing of power transformers. A way to\nquantify this beneﬁt is by means of temperature increase for the\nequivalent life expectancy. Recent measurements show a tem-\nperature advantage up to 20\n◦C for natural-ester-impregnated\ncellulose insulation [10]. Based on these data, upper temper-\nature rise limits for natural-ester-ﬁlled transformers could be\nselected up to the values given in Table II.\nTABLE II\nTEMPERATURE RISE LIMITS FOR TRANSFORMERS FILLED WITH\nNATURAL ESTER FL U I D SA SI NT H EIEEE STANDARD C57.154 [19]\nIn this case, even without the use of high-temperature in-\nsulating materials, transformers ﬁlled with natural ester ﬂuids\ncould be more than 20% smaller than equivalent mineral-oil-\nﬁlled units when designed for continuous operation at higher\ntemperatures. Alternatively, it can add more ﬂexibility to a\ntransformer designed for standard temperature limits when\noperated above its nameplate.\nV. C\nONDITION ASSESSMENT\nHigher operating temperatures associated to natural-ester-\nﬂuid different chemical composition and characteristics result\nin a different interpretation of the traditional tests used for\ncondition assessment.\nFor an acceptable transformer performance during factory\ntests and/or during the transformer lifetime, both mineral oils\nand natural ester ﬂuids need to meet and maintain certain\ncharacteristics. Properties that directly impact the performance\nof the transformer should then remain stable over time and\ntherefore be addressed in the design of the apparatus and\nmonitored during the transformer lifetime to identify deviations\nand subsequently apply corrective actions. Examples of those\nproperties are dielectric breakdown strength and viscosity.\nOn the other hand, some mineral oil properties commonly\nmonitored due to their direct correlation with the actual trans-\nformer performance may have reduced importance for natural\nester ﬂuids, for example, interfacial tension, dissipation factor,\nmoisture content, and the neutralization number [20].\nDissolved-gas analysis in oil has, for years, been the most\neffective tool for diagnosing incipient faults and troubleshoot-\ning other problems in power transformers. The same set of\ngases associated with various fault conditions in mineral oil is\nalso generated in natural ester ﬂuids. However, the proportions\nof the generated gases in natural ester ﬂuids are somewhat\ndifferent than in mineral oil, requiring different interpretation\nrules [21].\nReliable transformer service providers can support users with\nthe condition assessment of natural-ester-ﬁlled transformers.\nInternational bodies, such as Cigré [8], [22] or the IEEE Power\nand Energy Society Working Group PC57.155—“Guide for\nInterpretation of Gases Generated in Natural Ester and Syn-\nthetic Ester Immersed Transformer,” are also collecting users’\nexperiences in order to provide broader tools for end users.\nVI. R\nETROFILL OF EXISTING UNITS\nFor a number of reasons that range from environmental\nbeneﬁts to compliance with ﬁre safety regulations, natural\nester ﬂuids have been used to retroﬁll transformers already in\noperation. Retroﬁlling of power transformers requires qualiﬁed\nengineering assessment as it would probably require design\nconsiderations to accommodate the differences between min-\neral oil and such alternative ﬂuids [8].\n140 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS, VOL. 50, NO. 1, JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2014\nTABLE III\nNATURAL -ESTER -FLUID BENEFITS AND TRADEOFFS VERSUS\nCONVENTIONAL MINERAL OILS\nWhen the details of the transformer design from the original\nequipment manufacturer are available, one can apply the knowl-\nedge, tools, and rules developed for designing new natural-\nester-ﬁlled transformers to exactly predict the performance of\nthe transformer retroﬁlled with the alternative ﬂuid. However,\ndesign information is typically conﬁdential and not always\nreadily available. In such a case, engineering judgments must\nbe made to estimate the performance of the transformer when\nﬁlled with natural ester ﬂuids. One possibility, for example, is\nto use the data from the factory tests to estimate the internal heat\nﬂow distribution among the windings and, hence, to predict the\nimpact of the different ﬂuid properties on the winding and oil\ntemperatures.\nBefore retroﬁlling, it is also critical to verify the overall\ncondition of the transformer as well as the reliability of the\ninstalled components. Oil analysis and additional ﬁeld tests are\nrequired in that respect and will also provide a new baseline\nfor future monitoring and maintenance operations of the trans-\nformer. The ﬂuid exchange process needs to be well controlled\nin order to minimize the volume of residual mineral oil in the\ntransformer. Although mineral oil and natural ester ﬂuids are\nfully miscible, too much residual mineral oil (typically over\n6%–7%) can reduce natural-ester-ﬂuid ﬁre point below 300\n◦C\nand hence have them losing their “less ﬂammable” listing and\nK ﬁre hazard classiﬁcation.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nNatural ester ﬂuids have originally been developed as a high-\nﬁre-point environmentally friendly alternative to mineral oil in\nliquid-immersed transformers and have demonstrated to have\nadditional characteristics that address current challenges in the\npower industry beyond the safety and environmental aspects.\nLonger lifetime of the equipment to delay reinvestment, higher\npower ratings to increase proﬁtability or to consistently meet\nthe growing power demand, and extra compact transformers\nto increase capacity without expanding substation footprint\n(particularly useful for offshore platform) and improve the sub-\nstation overall safety are just some examples of the performance\nimprovements provided by the use of natural ester ﬂuids as\ntransformer oil.\nNatural-ester-ﬂuid main properties and characteristics have\nbeen presented in this paper and are summarized in Table III.\nActual references of natural ester applications addressing a\nvariety of users’ concerns and needs have also been given.\nThe impact of these unique characteristics in the transformer\nperformance and the considerations that need to be taken when\ndesigning the transformer as well as selecting the right natural\nester ﬂuid for long lasting transformer application has also\nbeen discussed. This discussion should support transformer end\nusers to evaluate the value of natural ester ﬂuids compared to\nother alternative ﬂuids as well as to understand the differences\nbetween the different natural ester ﬂuids available on the market\nin order for them to adequately specify and select the right\nproduct.\nFinally, it has been shown that reduced environmental im-\npact and improved safety and performance with natural ester\ndielectric insulating ﬂuids are also options for aged transform-\ners when driven by an appropriate handling and specialized\nengineering assessment.\nA\nCKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank the global team of scientists\nand transformer specialists in each ﬁeld of knowledge as well\nas implicit authors that have been investigating new solutions\nand making their application possible in transformers and trans-\nformer service.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] F.
