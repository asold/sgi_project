  "abstract": "The research investigates how to optimize prompt engineering techniques used for context-aware Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs). The effectiveness of prompt engineering guides model responses to enhance their output results. Static prompting methods fail to properly adapt to situations with complex dynamic contexts. This research develops adaptive prompt engineering methods which modify themselves through current contextual data and understanding model approaches and changes in input text. The authors use multiple case studies to evaluate these techniques in healthcare along with customer support operations. Adaptive prompts enable enhancements to task performance while improving accuracy and generating better user satisfaction rates in the system. The analysis demonstrates the need for continuous adjustments in order to optimize NLP model outputs while proving their value across multiple sectors. This paper enhances LLM development while establishing fundamental elements for context-sensitive artificial intelligence systems.",
