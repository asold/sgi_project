Comparisons could be pre and post-intervention or \npost-intervention only. \nRandomized comparison Comparisons made between two or more randomized groups. \nComparisons could be pre and post-intervention or post-\nintervention only. \nValidity evidenceb \nContent validity Evaluation of the degree to which the instrument accurately \nand completely represents the construct being assessed. \nInternal structure Evaluation of (1) reliability (inter-rater agreement, internal \nconsistency, temporal stability, parallel forms) and/or (2) \nfactor analysis data of the instrument.  \nRelationship to other variables Evaluation of the statistical association between the \nassessment tool and another measure of performance, or \nexpected developmental/experiential pattern. Other variable \nshould logically be expected to correlate to outcome assessed. \nParticipant characteristics Experience level (e.g., level of training, prior educational \nexperiences) or participant attributes (e.g., personality type).  \nSeparate measure Any assessment external to the target assessment tool or a sub-\ncomponent of the same tool that clearly measures a different \nconstruct (e.g., a tool with both technical and non-technical \nskills). Includes tools assessing teamwork or clinical \nperformance and non-tool based assessments such as patient \ncare metrics.  \nSupplemental digital content for Rosenman ED, Ilgen JS, Shandro JR, Harper AL, Fernandez R.

Observations may be done \nreal time at the bedside or using video recordings of clinical \nencounters. \na Fraenkel J, Wallen N. How to Design and Evaluate Research in Education.
