These instruments mainly cover corporate social responsibility, enterprise resource \nplanning systems and strategic management with selected management models. Enterprise resource planning \nsystems are the information base and support tools that a company’s management uses for making decisions. \nThe aim of these tools is to support a decrease in the consumption of raw materials, energy and other limited \nresources, which in turn increases the company’s performance. This is mainly due to lower costs and increased \ncorporate profitability. On the other hand, all these activities help to reduce the unfavorable ecologic impacts \nof business activities.\nThis paper discusses the various ways to increase business performance through selected strategic manage -\nment models through improving a company’s competitiveness. The last part of the article is aimed at looking \nat the results of a survey that was conducted in the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2013. The research was \nfocused on companies located in this country and it answered questions that surrounded on how these compa -\nnies improved and increased their business performance in the market from the sustainable development point \nof view.\nKeywords: corporate social responsibility, enterprise, enterprise resource planning systems, information \nsystems management by objectives, models of strategic management, resource management, strategic manage-\nment, sustainable development, survey, total quality management.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nIn today’s global world where markets are more connected than ever before, information about the \nfinancial position and performance of companies is becoming more and more important. Enterprises \nhave been continuously striving to boost their performance in order to be able to succeed in this \nhighly competitive market. Though in many cases, the negative social and environmental impacts on \nall of civilization are somehow overlooked. The success of advanced economies was mainly based \non the acquisition and exploitation of new colonies, natural resources and outlets. Many of the enter-\nprises unfortunately developed to the detriment of other natural, social and economic factors, and \nthis situation has subsequently affected multiple generations. However, this way of thinking has \nrecently changed considerably and – in connection with sustainable development principles – many \nenterprises have started to apply a completely different approach with regard to their hunt for \nimproved performance. They obviously realize their responsibility towards the environment and \npopulation and this trend will surely continue to expand even further. The environmental conse -\nquences of companies’ and human actions are obviously more visible and that puts pressure on them \nto ease their impact [1].\nThe CSR concept was first dealt with by foreign theorists who are specialized in management in \nthe second half of the 20th century. The crucial point is considered to have occurred in 1953, when \nAmerican economist Howard Bowen published his book entitled Social Responsibilities of the \n Businessman in which he defined CSR and stated that it was the social responsibility of enterprises \nin modern times [2].\nThe concept of company value management is becoming a new paradigm. From the accounting \nperspective, a company is successful if it generates profit. This view is, however, in terms of the \ntheory of value management, insufficient. It is necessary to achieve such a level of profit that the \nreturn on equity exceeds the alternative costs of equity.\nThe social responsibility concept is today becoming a more and more important part of corporate \nactivities, though it is still a voluntary concept. The reason is that no company is an isolated entity, \nbut rather part of society’s political, economic and social environment. Responsible behavior towards \nboth stakeholders and the environment should become an integral part of any corporate strategy. The \nactivities and behavior of corporations do not remain unknown to their surroundings – more and \nmore often, the media is reporting on various corporate scandals despite the fact that the general \npublic expects more friendly behavior by companies towards the environment in which they work, \nnot just acting to increase their own success.\nTo secure their competitiveness and future development, companies have to adapt to their external \nenvironment. The faster the reaction is, the better results they achieve. Therefore, having a flexible \nstrategy and measuring performance is becoming more important for securing a company’s future \nexistence. This can be achieved with the help of financial management that helps to set up strategic \ngoals, strategy and ways of measuring performance. These goals should be both quantitative and \nqualitative. Classical performance measurement is not sufficient because it is based on historical \ndata. To enable a company to effectively manage their finances, business information systems are \ncontinuously improved. These information systems provide a company’s management with all the \ninformation required to be able to make correct decisions and successfully manage the company. For \nthis purpose, new or modified enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are used. These systems \nallow for faster reactions to the current situation within a company as well as to the changes in its \nenvironment. The term new management system will be understood in the following text as systems \nincluding, but not limited to Balanced Scorecard, Management by Objectives and Total Quality \nManagement. These systems have been used abroad for many years. In the Czech Republic, they \nhave been used more and more frequently [3].\n2 METHODOLOGY\nThe methodology in this paper is based on a literature overview that not only covers scientific pub-\nlications but also some scientific articles that have been published on the subject matter. For the \npurpose, an electronic questionnaire was taken in January and February 2013 in companies situated \nin the Czech Republic. The vast majority of analyzed companies were located in the Central and \nNortheastern parts of Bohemia. First, a pilot questionnaire was issued, through which it was verified \nthat the respondents understood the given questions. The final version of the questionnaire was \nbased on their answers and comments.\nThe questionnaires were answered by company managers – mainly financial managers. The com-\npanies were focused on automotive production and the production of glass components and furniture. \nThe above-mentioned industries are typical in this area. The research team received 104 completed \nquestionnaires. According to data from the Czech Statistical Office, there are approximately 10,000 \nbusiness entities in the Liberec Region. Based on this figure, a relevant 1% sample was selected \nsince, unfortunately, companies in the Czech Republic are not interested in responding to assigned \nquestionnaires and thus participating in research.\nThe survey consisted of three main parts: the first part contained basic information about the busi-\nness entities, the second part was focused on the usage of ERP systems in these companies and the \nlast part analyzed their financial management. The main goal of the survey was to monitor the pre -\nsent situation with regard to the practical use of performance measurement systems, mainly with a \nfocus on strategic management innovated approaches. The survey was prepared in an electronic \nformat and it contained 50 questions. To obtain relevant information about the analyzed companies, \n H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015) 667\n668 H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015)\nboth closed and open questions were asked. The task of the respondents was to answer open ques -\ntions with no options available. These answers were selected by companies at their sole discretion. \nClosed questions included some options from which the respondents could choose. Within the scope \nof the survey, 120 companies were contacted and we received back 104 completed questionnaires. \nNinety-six of them were usable. There was a certain risk that the respondents may understand the \nquestions incorrectly, and this could affect the results of the survey.\nThe data collected by the questionnaires were thoroughly analyzed. These data were processed \nwith the help of an Excel spreadsheet. The results of each of the questions were published as a \n percentage share of the respective responses of all companies analyzed. In this paper, only few \nselected topics are mentioned.\n3 SELECTED DEFINITIONS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\nIn recent years, the question of the existence of a symbiotic relationship between economic growth \nand environmental protection has become quite topical. That is why discussions about sustainable \ndevelopment occur so frequently nowadays. Sustainable development is defined and characterized \nin various ways. The concept of sustainable development is based on the idea of achieving a dynamic \nbalance in various areas. From the practical point of view, it is the balance between production and \nconsumption, the balance between the economy and the environment, and the balance between \ndevelopment and protection. In spite of the differences and open question, most people agree that \nsustainable development involves significant changes in the economy in order to improve environ -\nmental quality and human welfare in a long-term perspective [4].\nWaas, Verbruggen and Wright stated that, ‘contemporary society considers sustainable develop -\nment to be the best way to address these complex and interrelated problems for the sake of current \nand future generations and for the integrity of the planet’ [5].\nThe most widely known and also the simplest definition of sustainable development was pre -\nsented by Gro Harlem Brundtland in 1987: ‘Sustainable development is development that meets the \nneeds of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own \nneeds’ [6]. In other words, as often quoted: ‘We did not inherit this planet from our ancestors, but \nrather borrowed it from our children’. This definition was mentioned in the report entitled ‘Our \nCommon Future’ published by the UN World Commission on Environment and Development (UN \nWCED). The basic principles surrounding the sustainable use of natural resources were formulated \nby Daly and Cobb [7]. According to the cited authors, the permanent sustainability principles may \nbe summarized as follows:\n•\t The level of use of non-renewable resources may not exceed the level of development/growth of \nreplacement renewable resources.\n•\t The level of use of renewable resources may not exceed their rate of regeneration.\n•\t The level of emissions of pollutants into the environment shall not exceed the environment’s \nability to assimilate them.\nThe question of sustainable use of renewable resources is quite obvious and understandable, though \nin practice it is often ignored. The assimilation ability of the environment and the related permissible \nemission levels are often the subject of frequent discussion. Not only should value be admitted to the \nenvironment, nature and landscape, but also should the price; both negative and positive externalities \nmust be internalized so the market may become a truly functioning market with respect to natural \nvalues.\n H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015) 669\nIn the Czech Republic, sustainable development is defined by Act No. 17/1992 Coll., on the Envi-\nronment (Section 6) as follows: ‘Sustainable development is development that maintains for both the \npresent and future generations the possibility to meet their basic life necessities without compromis-\ning the diversity of nature and while preserving the natural functions of ecosystems’. Problems of \nsustainable development in the Czech Republic are being solved with the help of Structural Funds \nof the European Union. The main goal of these funds is to help the development of economic and \nsocial area and thereby to contribute to the improvement of the environment.\nThe question of sustainable development was dealt with by Josef Vavroušek, the first Czechoslo-\nvak Minister of the Environment, who defined it as follows: ‘… sustainable life – or more precisely \nthe way of living – is aimed at looking for the harmony between humans and nature, between society \nand its environment so that we meet the ideals of humanism and respect life and nature in all forms \nand at all times …’ [8].\nRynda defined sustainable development as ‘... a complex set of strategies allowing people – by \nmeans of economic resources and technologies – to satisfy human needs, including material, \ncultural and spiritual, while fully respecting environmental limits. To make this possible within \nthe global scope of the current world, we must redefine these strategies into local, regional and \nglobal’ [9].\nThe aim of sustainable development is to provide society with perspective visions. The activities \nthat meet current needs may be of a short-term nature. Sustainable development is a complex con -\ncept that covers all human activities down to the local levels. The aim of sustainable development is \nto improve the quality of life for both the present and future generations, while protecting Earth’s \nresources. Sustainable development is based on democracy, where the government respects the basic \nrights of freedom, equal opportunities and cultural diversity. It further supports high levels of \nemployment in the economy, with an emphasis on education, innovation, social and territorial cohe-\nsion and the protection of human life and the environment.\n3.1 The basic pillars of sustainable development\nThe concept of sustainable development is an alternative model for the development of society com-\npared with the dominating industrial economy. In general, sustainable development may be \nunderstood as the achievement of balance between economic sustainability, social sustainability and \nenvironmental sustainability. Considering the levels of policy and society, we can conclude that \nsustainable development needs a balanced growth in all four relatively independent areas: environ -\nmental, economic, social and political.\nSustainable development is often understood only as environmental protection. The fact is that \nenvironmental protection is only one-third of it. In addition to the environmental pillar, there are also \neconomic and social pillars. Therefore, we can consider sustainable development to be the effort to \nreach a balance between economic, social and environmental areas. The implementation of basic \nsustainable development principles over the long run is only possible if all of society is involved. \nImpulses for improvement must come not only from the public but also from the private sector and \nnon-governmental non-profit organizations. However, civil responsibility plays a rather important \nand key role in this process as well. We may conclude that environmental protection is the limiting \nfactor of sustainable development, while the economy is its tool. The aim of sustainable develop -\nment is to ensure a quality life for everyone. Sustainable development is often understood as a \nprinciple comprising three pillars – environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and social \nsustainability [10].\n670 H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015)\n3.1.1 The environmental pillar\nThe environmental pillar mainly represents the protection of fauna, flora, air, water, soil, ecosystems \nand natural resources. The key factor is the use of mineral resources, non-renewable energy sources, \nraw materials and also space and waste. To avoid deterioration and to boost improvement of the \nenvironment, we must focus on priorities, such as setting limitations on global warming, inhibiting \nbiodiversity loss, controlling and reducing harmful emissions and their entering the natural water \nand nutrient cycle [11].\n3.1.2 The economic pillar\nThe economic pillar represents economic development and improving economic competitiveness. \nEconomics is a rather strong and efficient tool of sustainable development that may, for instance, \nhelp to ensure the profitability of sustainable investments both in the public and private sectors, to \ntransfer the results of research aimed at sustainable development issues into manufacturing and \neveryday life and to influence the decision-making process by consumers on all levels. The eco -\nnomic pillar covers both incentive tools for those economic subjects that do not want to adapt \nthemselves to the imperative of sustainability voluntarily, as well as parameters – fully market com-\npatible mechanisms – that suddenly allow for a completely functioning market with all its benefits \nto protect the environment, not to put it in danger or to impair it. This pillar influences a company’s \ncapital  structure [12].\n3.1.3 The social pillar\nThe social pillar of sustainable development represents the true meaning of what it is to be a human \nbeing, social appreciation and the development of culture and maintenance of traditions. With regard \nto this pillar, the most important aspect is the correct functioning of the family, municipalities, public \ninstitutions and overall society. The horizontal theme of equal opportunities is also an integral part \nof corporate social responsibility (CSR).\nAs these three pillars of sustainable development mutually interact, a system that does not give \npreference to any one of them must be established. For example, in the field of environmental protec-\ntion, excessive support of environmental features and issues may lead in economic stagnation in the \narea. On the other hand, if economic development issues are preferred, the environmental situation \nmay get worse. Also, excessive stress put on social aspects may result in considerable problems – for \nexample, decreased competitiveness in economic competition between the regions.\nSome authors further divide the social pillar into political and social pillars. That is why we some-\ntimes talk about four basic pillars of sustainable development that are relatively independent:\n•\t environmental\n•\t economic\n•\t social and\n•\t political.\nThe environmental dimension means adopting active measures aimed at preventing existing and \nunsustainable harm to the environment and automatically including them in any strategy that aims to \nbecome sustainable. This does not only apply to governments of individual countries and international \ncommunities, because these strategies must involve consumers who may become an important partner \nfor enforcing changes. The manufacturing sector will then have sufficient motivation to implement \nchanges resulting in continuous sustainability. This is, however, not a problem only for manufacturers \nand technology. In connection with consumption, some environmentally oriented thinkers talk about \n H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015) 671\nthe concept of ‘voluntary modesty’, which means at a certain point, one should realize that from a \ncertain level of richness, the quality of life no longer improves (i.e. with a third or more car, your feel-\ning of happiness will not continue to grow – instead you might experience some frustration). In \nconnection with this, we talk about global problems of the environment, such as climate changes, \ndesertification, emissions, global warming, the greenhouse effect, pollution and smog [13].\n4 THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS  \nOF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\nAt the moment, there is no uniform global definition of CSR. There are only various definitions by \nauthors from the academic sphere, non-government organizations and companies. CSR has its his -\ntorical roots back in the 19th century, when Andrew Carnige published his opinion that rich people \nshould have a moral duty to share their property with others [14]. Then, in the second half of the 20th \ncentury, the concept of CSR conception was explored by foreign management theorists. The break-\nthrough came in 1953 when US economist Howard Bowen released his book entitled Social \nResponsibilities of the Businessman. It contained a definition CSR and the idea that it should be the \nsocial responsibility of modern age corporations [15]. The boom in CSR appreciation came about in \nthe 1960s, especially in the USA, where customers started to place emphasis on how companies \npresented themselves and what values they respected.\nAnother important milestone in the development of CSR was the statements made by CSR oppo-\nnents, including Friedman and Levitt, who argued that corporations should be only responsible for \ngenerating profits and the only responsibility they have should be towards their shareholders. This \nopinion by Friedman and Levitt was rejected by Freemen, who claimed that companies are not \nresponsible towards their shareholders, but rather towards their stakeholders who are affected by \ncorporate activities and who also may influence such activities [16, 17]. Freemen also defined the \nterm ‘stakeholders’ and helped managers who wanted to implement CSR into practice to find the \nright direction. The definition of stakeholders helped to determine the entities managers should be \nresponsible towards.\nOther authors, Aras and Crowther, stated that the concept of CSR should not be aimed only at the \ncurrent impact, but especially at the future [18]. Other authors dealt with CSR in their papers, such \nas Mohr and Webb, who emphasized that it would be beneficial if socially responsible corporations \nwould be managed per the stakeholder theory [19]. The modern concept of CSR was developed in \nthe 1950s, formalized in the 1960s and spread in the 1970s, mainly in the USA. In Europe CSR, \narrived in the 1990s. The basic document for enforcing CSR in EU countries is the Lisbon Confer -\nence of 2000, where the commitment to support CSR in all EU countries was assumed. The European \nUnion characterizes CSR as follows: ‘CSR is a voluntary integration of social and environmental \nviewpoints into everyday corporate operations and integration with the neighborhood’. CSR is the \nactivities of managers that are aimed at improving the working conditions of their employees or \n supplier–customer relationships. Companies also focus their activities on environmental protection, \ncloser cooperation with local administration and other concerned groups.\nThe European Commission prepared a new CSR definition in 2011. It concentrated on corporate \ncompetitiveness with a focus on risk management, cost savings, access to capital, customer relation-\nships, human resource management and innovation capacity. The definition reacted to the developing \nand newly arising conditions in the area of CSR [20].\nCurrently, no standard generally applicable definition comprehensively characterizing the term \nCSR exists. This results from the fact that CSR is based on optionality, so firmly determined \nboundaries do not exist, which gives rise to space in which to construe and interpret the concept \nbroadly and opens up space for holding a broad discussion on both the theoretical and practical \n672 H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015)\nfields.  Alexander Dahlsrud, the most prominent personality dealing with this issue, analysed 37 \ndefinitions of the term in his scientific article entitled ‘How Corporate Social Responsibility is \ndefined: an Analysis of 37 Definitions’. The individual definitions most frequently include the \nenvironmental area, social area, economic area, stakeholders’ area and optionality area. Dahlsrud \ndiscovered that 80% of the CSR definitions contained four of the five above-mentioned areas, and \n97% of them contained three of the five above-mentioned areas. Based on the analysis, he came to \nthe conclusion that although a number of such definitions exist, the definitions were in accord with \neach other [21].\nThe development of the view on CSR has also been dealt with by the prominent theorist A.B. \n Carroll, who splits the contents of CSR definitions into two main schools of thought. The first school \nof thought concentrates on an enterprise and the maximization of its profit regardless of the impact \non society. However, he is of the opinion that that school of thought is wrong, and the scope of \n obligations of individual enterprises towards society should be widened, which he characterizes as \nthe other school of thought. An enterprise should engage in activities that are desirable from the \nviewpoint of societal values and targets [22].\n4.1 The development of corporate social responsibility in the Czech Republic\nThe concept of CSR did not appear in the Czech Republic until the second half of the 1990s because \nit had a central planning system for the previous 40+ years. If we look at the history of undertaking \nin the territory of the former Czechoslovakia, we should not forget the success of the famous \n shoe-maker Tomáš Baťa. He tried to create favorable conditions for his employees, providing them \nwith many employee benefits. When the health and social department was established back in 1924, \nhis employees already enjoyed above-average wages. He also built residential houses of a higher \nstandard and hostels for his employees. Also, he employed the blind or otherwise handicapped \n people and significantly contributed to the development of the town of Zlín [14].\nToday, the Business Leader Forum, a national CSR partner, enforces CSR in the Czech Republic \nand improves its general awareness and implements other related activities. The Business Leaders \nForum was established in 1992 by leading Czech companies in cooperation with the international \norganization, The Prince of Wales International Business Leaders Forum. It is an association of \ninternational and Czech companies promoting the enforcement of ethics in business, the actual \nimplementation of CSR concepts and cooperation amongst the corporate, public and non-profit \n sectors [14].\n4.2 The basic pillars of corporate social responsibility\nCSR is reflected in the integration of positive attitudes, actions or programmes into corporate strate-\ngies at top management levels. It calls for a shift from ‘profit only’ to a more complex and wider \ncombination of people, planet and profit. In general, CSR is divided into three basic areas – eco -\nnomic, social and environmental. These three areas – pillars – cover all interests and activities that \neach socially responsible corporation should meet or adhere to. The three pillars should be as bal -\nanced as possible (Fig. 1).\n4.2.1 The economic pillar\nThe fulfillment of economic pillar principles especially affects customers, suppliers, investors and \nthe public sector. The economic pillar may be further divided into four basic themes. Each of them \n H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015) 673\ncovers specific activities. These basic themes and their breakdown into individual activities, includ-\ning selected examples, can be found in Table 1.\n4.2.2 The social pillar\nThe social pillar should be divided into two areas – internal and external. The internal area is a com-\npany’s social policy. The external area is especially aimed at philanthropy, altruism and cooperation \nwith local communities, i.e. local interest groups. The social policy of each company and all its tools \nmust be directed towards establishing a partnership with their employees. Employees must be \noffered the opportunity to make use of his/her active skills and abilities and  through his/her satisfac-\ntion, the company achieves its goals. Social policy is a tool for making employees satisfied, resulting \nin increased company profits. The social pillar may be divided into seven basic themes. These basic \nthemes and their breakdown into individual activities, including selected examples, can be found in \nTable 2.\n4.2.3 The environmental pillar\nThe last pillar of activities that socially responsible corporations are focused on is the environmental \npillar. An integral part of each entity must be its adherence to the principles of sustainable develop-\nment ensuring a quality life for future generations. A company’s responsible behavior towards the \nenvironment is expected by the general public. Moreover, companies themselves consist of people \nwho should be concerned in reducing/eliminating negative impacts on the environment and sparing \nusing natural resources, not only in favor of future companies, but also for future generations in \ngeneral. Within this pillar, a company is especially aimed at reducing the negative impacts of its \nactivities on the environment. In business practice, this environmental approach is implemented \nthrough environmental management. The main goals of this system are environmental protection, \nthe protection of natural resources, reducing emissions, reducing pollutants, and the protection of the \nhealth and safety of employees and the public. The environmental pillar may be divided into six \nbasic themes. These basic themes and their breakdown into individual activities, including selected \nexamples, can be found in Table 3.\nFigure 1: The pillars of corporate social responsibility.

Not random, sudden or one-shot charity activities that could put the \nwhole CSR concept in jeopardy – but rather, a systematic approach and long-term effects.\n5 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ERP SYSTEMS AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\nIt is clear that most companies located mainly in market developed economies have entered the com-\npetition network that has moved from a local to a global business environment. Due to turbulently \nchanging business and market environments, companies must be very efficient and adaptable if they \nTable 3: The environmental pillar of CSR.\nCSR themes CSR activities Examples of CSR activities\nEnvironmental \npolicy \nManagement Environmental strategy implementation.

Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015) 677\nwant to survive in the market and be successful. One possible way for a company to be more efficient \nand adaptable is through the implementation of ERP systems into their business environment.\nGrabski, Leech and Schmidt define and describe ERP systems as follows: ‘ERP systems are typi-\ncally the largest, most complex and most demanding information systems implemented by firms, \nrepresenting a major departure from the individual and departmental information systems prevalent \nin the past’. ERP systems are one of the components that have a transformative force on the account-\ning profession, recording accounting transactions and evaluating accounting reports with an impact \non auditing, risk management, the design of management control systems, organizational changes \nand strategies, firm benefits (internal, external), business processes, etc. [23].\nAhmad and Zulkifli stated that ERP systems could be a useful tool for companies. The main goal \nis to build a strong information system infrastructure and to enable management to make better deci-\nsions based on accurate and on-time information [24].\nIn the early 20th century, an approach that was focused on the relationship between the usage of \nnatural resources and the costs and benefits resulting from business activities appeared for the first \ntime. The link between natural resources and business needs was used to apply quantitative mode -\nling to understand management options with a focus on the importance of integrating natural \ncomponents and human needs into a solution of the optimal usage of natural resources in accordance \nwith costs, revenues and profit [25].\nResource management gradually developed during the 20th century and since the beginning of the \n21st century, it has been crucial for many highly developed countries. All of this has resulted in a \nsituation that sustainable management must consider these activities as intertwined systems [26]. \nERP systems help to effectively record business processes and manage them. Based on the data \nobtained, information is prepared for management to help them make better decisions. This allows \nfor the more efficient use of resources, including a subsequent decrease of costs and an increase of \ncorporate profitability.\n6 INCREASING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE THROUGH SELECTED  \nSTRATEGIC MANAGEMENT MODELS\nImproving company performance is one of the basic preconditions for success in highly competitive \nenvironments. There are multiple methods that may help a company to improve its performance and \nefficiency. In the companies located in Central and Northeast Bohemia, the most frequently-used \nmethods are the Balance Scorecard, Management by Objectives and Total Quality Management, as \nrevealed answers to the survey (see Section 7). The above-mentioned companies usually have  foreign \nparent companies in which the given methods are commonly used; therefore, they implement them to \nmanage their daughter companies. The last two methods will be described in more detail hereinafter.\n6.1 Management by objectives\nThe Management by Objectives and Self Control method was first described by Peter Ferdinand \nDrucker in his book released in 1955 under the title, The Practice of Management, and later in the \nsecond part of his book entitled Managing Managers. The key principal of this method is to achieve \norganizational goals by involving all persons interested in the relevant processes in the spirit of \nteamwork. The entire system is based on the presumption that people work better if they know what \nis exactly expected from them [27].\nPeter Drucker thinks that ordinary employees should know exactly what they are doing and why, \nincluding what their company is supposed to achieve. In order to ensure this, top management must \nalso know what it is doing and why. People at all levels of an organization must know what exactly \n678 H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015)\nthey are supposed to do, what is expected from them and where they should move their company by \ndoing so. On the other hand, they should know what can happen if their tasks are not fulfilled and \nwhat goals will not be met. Drucker is convinced that in order to run everything smoothly, employ-\nees from the level immediately below the main one involved should always be involved in making \ndecisions regarding plans and in setting goals. Drucker further emphasizes the importance of the \nability of each manager in an organization to correctly set goals. The goal setting process starts at the \ntop management level, by setting the preliminary (overall) goals, including indicators to measure \nwhether the goals have been met. These goals are modifiable and one of the greatest advantages of \nthis method is the motivation felt by employees when they are given a chance to help in setting goals. \nUpon making lower level managers acquainted with preliminary goals and preconditions for plan -\nning, their supervisor may start with discussions regarding more detailed goals. The supervisor \nshould ask his/her subordinates whether the overall goals are achievable, in what time frame and \nwhat resources will be required [27].\nManagement by objectives is a suitable tool that provides both employees and their managers with \nthe opportunity to be actively involved in company operations/management and also to assume \ngreater responsibility. This method has the following benefits and advantages: Management by \nobjectives leads to an improvement of management, especially using the planning process. While \ncompiling plans and schedules, managers must think about the objectivity, efficiency and achievabil-\nity of the set goals. Another benefit is the clarification of the organizational structure and goals. \nDuring management by objectives implementation, organizations often realize weaknesses they \nwould never notice. Competencies are delegated and responsibilities become more transparent. The \nthird benefit is that Management by Objectives allows identification with goals and active participa-\ntion in their achievement. This is why those involved/concerned have an internal feeling of \nresponsibility. The fourth benefit is the development of efficient inspection. When goals are clearly \nset, it is much easier for managers to check on their subordinates. In addition, motivation is sup -\nported when employees set their goals by themselves – in this way, they motivate themselves to \nimprove their individual performance. Another benefit is that during the delegation of tasks from \nupper to lower levels of an organization, weaknesses may be discovered. The last benefit of this \nmethod is the requirement for an objective assessment, i.e. goals must be measurable and clear. The \nlevel of achievement of individual goals may then be easily assessed, are transparent and are of \ncourse more objective [27].\n6.2 Total quality management\nWith general progress, there are some social changes that come about that affect all aspects of \nhuman activities, including business. The shift in customer priorities, their needs and requirements \nis obvious and significant. Performance cannot be judged by quantity alone. The quantity of what is \nmanufactured, the headcount and short-term profit may mean nothing to a company. Not only are \nfinal customers key but so are the relationship between the company and its employees and its com-\nmunication with suppliers, dealers, etc.\nTotal quality management, as a strategic management model, is an integration philosophy based \non a complex approach to management that works horizontally across an entire organization and is \naimed at continuously improving quality and processes. It provides a framework for efficiently \nimproving quality and work efficiency as the basic factors for increasing an organization’s profitabil-\nity and competitiveness. It identifies the challenges within a company and helps to set the goals that \nmake the use of labor and materials most efficient to achieve the goals. The birth of the total quality \nmanagement principle dates back to the first half of the 20th century. It was mainly developed in \n H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015) 679\nJapan where it helped the country to recover from a crisis and join global competition. The Japanese \napproach to total quality management can be divided into four basic concepts – Kaizen, Atarimae \nHinshitsu, Kansei and Miryokuteki Hinshitsu. Kaizen  is based on the continual improvement of \nprocesses through teamwork, personal discipline, high morale, quality meetings and proposals for \ninnovation. Atarimae Hishitsu says that things should work exactly as we expect them to work. The \nKansei philosophy says that the research into how customers actually use a company’s products may \nthe company to improve their quality. And last but not least – products should have some esthetic \nquality – the idea of Miryokuteki Hinshitsu [28].\nThese approaches are clearly understandable and logical, but thoroughly applying them in the \nwestern world is almost impossible. This, however, does not prevent the creation of a certain ideal \nthat we all can look up to and follow – and this is the key message of total quality management.\nTotal quality management is a concept of quality management that is not – as one and only – based \non standards or standardized instructions and recommendations. It is an open system that is based on \nclear principals, but its form must be always fully adapted to a specific organization. To apply total \nquality management efficiently, a specific model is needed. Of course, total quality management \nimplementation starts with the top positions. Then, this principle of management must be gradually \nintroduced to all employees and parties concerned. It must cover all activities and company ele -\nments. In sum, total quality management implementation is quite complex [28].\n7 RESULTS OF THE SURVEY\nFigure 2 presents the structure of the companies that were questioned and analyzed in accordance \nwith EU legislation. Microenterprises are defined as companies with fewer than 10 employees. \nTheir annual turnover and sum of assets shall not exceed 2 million EUR. Small enterprises are com-\npanies with fewer than 50 employees and their annual turnover and sum of assets shall not exceed \n10  million EUR. Medium-sized enterprises are companies with fewer than 250 employees. Their \nannual  turnover shall not exceed 50 million EUR and their sum of assets may not be higher than \n43 million EUR. If a company does not meet any of the previously mentioned criteria, it is consid -\nered a large company [29].\nWithin the scope of the survey, companies were asked to provide information about their legal \nform of business. Fifty-two percent of them were limited companies (Ltd.), 30% of them were pub-\nlic limited companies (Plc.), 12% of them were individual entrepreneurs, 2% of them were \ncooperatives and the rest had other legal forms of business in accordance with the Czech legislation.\nOne part of the survey was focused on the problems associated with the use of ERP systems that \nare intended for recording accounting transactions, managerial accounting and for the needs of stra-\ntegic management in general. Figure 3 shows the structure of ERP systems used in the analyzed \ncompanies situated in the Czech Republic. The majority of the companies were owned by foreign \nFigure 2: The size of a company in accordance with EU legislation. Source: self-produced.\n680 H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015)\nentities and the system was chosen because an ERP system is currently being used by their parent \ncompany or because the system is used by their suppliers or customers. A lot of analyzed companies \nwere involved with automotive manufacturing. The most frequently used ERP system is SAP, which \nwas present in 38% of the companies who responded.\nBased on the ERP System used, the respondents answered their level of satisfaction with the sys-\ntem they use in terms of its functionality. The results revealed that 11.11% of the respondents were \nsatisfied with their ERP system, 66.67% of the respondents were mostly satisfied with it and did not \nhave any crucial critical comments on the functionality of the system. Only 3.7% of the questioned \nrespondents were dissatisfied with the ERP system that was used by the company in which they \nworked. The rest were mostly dissatisfied.\nWith regard to the concept of sustainable development, the companies were asked if they use \nfinancial analysis to evaluate their performance and financial health. Eighty-four percent of them \nanswered yes while the rest do not. This result corresponds with the structure of chosen companies \nthat were analyzed. It is mainly microenterprises that do not prepare data for making management \ndecisions. If a company prepares an annual financial analysis, there is a good possibility that the \ncompany’s resources such as finance, human resources, energy use and production resources will be \nused better. 27.66% of the respondents use financial analysis for making planning decisions. Within \nthe companies analyzed, another major goal (with a share of 21.28%) of the data obtained from a \nfinancial analysis is based on setting strategic goals. Feedback for controlling it was stated by \n20.21% of the companies. The most surprising outcome of the survey was the fact that some of the \ncompanies analyzed do not use the data obtained from a financial analysis for any purpose at all. \nThis may particularly be caused by the fact that the companies might have set management criteria \nthat is different from the standard indicators of a financial analysis, or this reality may be caused by \nfinancial managers’ reluctance to work with outputs from a financial analysis.\nPart of the research dealing with corporate performance is the use of strategic management mod-\nels. From the survey, it was determined that 76.00% of the analyzed companies do not use any model \nof strategic management, 12.00% of them use balanced scorecard, 6% of them total quality manage-\nment and the rest use management by objectives.\nThe next question was based on an analysis of the implementation of the strategic management \nmodel. 63.64% of the companies that use a strategic management model implemented that model \nindividually. 27.27% of the analyzed companies used the services of an external consulting company \nand the rest of the companies were not able to answer the question. Implementing some strategic \nFigure 3:  The structure of used enterprise resource planning systems in the analyzed companies. \nSource: self-produced.\n H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015) 681\nmanagement model helps a company to improve and streamline its business operations with a focus \non better usage of all resources used in production, as shown in Fig. 4. How the strategic manage -\nment model is implemented influences how much the implementation costs and, the speed and \nefficiency of the system’s implementation and the relevance of presented data.\nAs a part of resource management, we must also consider CSR. The companies were asked if they \nincorporate CSR in their corporate environment. 80.00% of the analyzed companies have imple -\nmented it and only 20.00% of the companies have not yet addressed CSR, as shown in Fig. 5. The \nresult was relatively surprising and it can be explained by the fact that a lot of the questioned com -\npanies were owned by foreign entities.\nCompanies in the automotive industry rank tops among the types of companies that include CSR \nin their corporate environment and simultaneously report their individual activities. It is possible to \nstate that the most frequently used method of reporting CSR is the Global Reporting Initiative \nmethod.\n8 CONCLUSION\nA socially responsible corporation is characterized by its responsible behavior and activities towards \nits surroundings. This can be divided into three basic areas – economic, which is mainly oriented on \nprofit, social, which is aimed at people and environmental, which is focused on planet Earth. \nTherefore, we talk about 3P (profit, people, planet). The application of 3P means a company is \nfocused not only on economic growth, but also on the environmental and social aspects of its activi-\nties with regard to the Triple-Bottom-Line. The main idea behind this concept is that the company’s \nperformance may be – in addition to the traditional economic indicators – also measured by its social \nand environmental attitudes [30].\nERP systems allow businesses to accurately and efficiently monitor the costs of the company. \nThese costs can be managed by the company. Cost Management enables more efficient use of inputs \nand leads to a reduction of corporate costs, which leads to better financial performance. This situa -\nFigure 4: Implementing a strategic management model. Source: self-produced.\nFigure 5: The integration of corporate social responsibility in the companies. Source: self-produced\n682 H. Jáčová & J. Horák, Int. J. Sus. Dev. Plann. Vol. 10, No. 5 (2015)\ntion has a positive impact on profit. On the basis of the higher profit enterprises levy higher taxes to \nthe state budget. After that the taxes are being used for redistribution in the economy and may thus \nlead to elimination the negative impact of business activities on the environment. The aim of the \nsurvey was to determine which Enterprise Resource Planning systems companies use to track costs, \nwhat methods are used for improving the financial performance of companies and if the companies \nfollow the rules connected with the CSR.\nThe Management by Objectives methodology provides the opportunity to gain a huge labor \npotential. It is a suitable tool used by a company to achieve its strategic goals and to improve the \nperformance of its individual employees by involving all of them in the organization’s management. \nIt also motivates employees on all levels (including top managers) to perform even better. It allows \nfor a more efficient inspection and coordination of activities as well as for an earlier revision of \nprocedures or even goals. The employees – due to their higher level of motivation, self-fulfillment \nand active involvement in the organization’s activities – achieve greater levels of efficiency and self-\nsatisfaction. It is very important not to underestimate this method and take some time to apply it \nthoroughly in order to avoid the problems mentioned herein. Because of its complexity, it is better-\nsuited for medium-sized and large organizations where it may occur quite often that the employees \ndo not precisely know the organization’s goals (and even their own goals). Managers, who must \ncorrectly set the goals, are quite important for the successful implementation of the Management by \nObjectives method.\nTotal quality management brings many benefits that may be crucial for obtaining a competitive \nadvantage while maintaining quality services and products. By implementing the total quality man-\nagement model, quantities of scrap are significantly reduced and so are the costs, which lead to an \noverall increase in efficiency.\nThe results of our survey confirmed that companies mainly use financial analysis for measuring \ntheir performance and for company management purposes. This result corresponds with the size and \nlegal form of the company. Because of the criticism of the traditional methods used to measure busi-\nness performance, some innovations have been implemented. Recently, due to turbulent changes in \nthe economic environment, companies are more increasingly using complex models for manage -\nment and measuring their performance. These models include balanced scorecard, total quality \nmanagement and management by objectives.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis article was written as one of the outputs of the research project entitled ‘The analysis of data \napplicability from a company’s SAP information system when forming a financial plan’, which was \nconducted at the Faculty of Economics at the Technical University of Liberec in 2013 with the finan-\ncial support from the Technical University in the competition that supported specific projects of \nacademic research (a student grant competition).\nREFERENCES\n[1] Lompo, M.K., Ballet, J. & Dubios, J.-L., Sustainable human development and the capability \napproach: Integrating Environment, Responsibility and Collective Agency.
