Kaplan–Meier for univariable evalu-\nation and Cox regression analyses for multivariable evaluation of the DINO-ViT risk groups were performed for prediction \nof OS and DSS. For validation, a cohort from a tertiary care centre was used.\nResults A significant risk stratification was achieved in univariable analysis for OS and DSS in the training (n = 443, log rank \ntest, p < 0.01) and validation set (n = 266, p < 0.01). In multivariable analysis, including age, metastatic status, tumour size \nand grading, the DINO-ViT risk stratification was a significant predictor for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 3.03; 95%-confidence \ninterval [95%-CI] 2.11–4.35; p < 0.01) and DSS (HR 4.90; 95%-CI 2.78–8.64; p < 0.01) in the training set but only for DSS \nin the validation set (HR 2.31; 95%-CI 1.15–4.65; p  = 0.02). DINO-ViT visualisation showed that features were mainly \nextracted from nuclei, cytoplasm, and peritumoural stroma, demonstrating good interpretability.\nConclusion The DINO-ViT can identify high-risk patients using histological images of ccRCC.

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analy-\nsis of haematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) histopathologi-\ncal tissue sections has demonstrated potential as a low-cost \nmethod to predict genetic mutations and other relevant altera-\ntions in oncology, including genitourinary tumours [5 –7]. \nTherefore, AI has gained popularity in biomarker research.\nOne major drawback in the development of many AI mod-\nels has been the need to provide the model with labelled data. \nNewer approaches aim for models that can be trained on unla-\nbelled data such as self-supervised learning models. When \napplied to image recognition, such model is tasked to identify \nimage features that serve as meaningful representation for the \nimages provided in the dataset. Especially in medical image \nrecognition, where labelled images are scarce, this method \ncan help to build potentially more accurate and generalisable \nmodels.\nVision transformer (ViT) is a transparent deep learning \napproach. In contrast to many other deep learning models, ViT \nuses the position of the different objects and their relationship \nto each other. Furthermore, ViT makes use of the concept of \n“attention” by merging input from multiple “attention heads” \nthat focus on different image structures. Visualisation of the \n“attention” structures provides a high level of transparency. \nThus, ViTs are increasingly used in medical research [8–10].\nIn a recent work, a self-supervised model called DINO \n(self-distillation with no labels) was combined with a ViT [11]. \nThis combination was designed to identify recurring structures \non the images independent of image labels, for example result-\ning in the identification of different animals independent of the \nbackground [11].\nThe application of such models in outcome prediction in \nccRCC has not been investigated. We thus made use of the \ncombination of a ViT and DINO (DINO-ViT) to extract image \nfeatures and use the resulting feature vector in a Cox regres-\nsion model to predict overall and disease-specific survival (OS/\nDSS) directly from H&E histopathological images in ccRCC \nand validate this method on unseen data using an external \ndataset.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy population\nThe framework and reporting of this study were designed \non the basis of the TRIPOD checklist [12]. For patient/slide \ninclusion, the ccRCC cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas \n(TCGA-KIRC) (training) and patients from the University \nMedical Centre Mannheim (validation) who had undergone \npartial or radical nephrectomy between 2006 and 2011 were \nscreened. The following inclusion criteria were applied for \nthe selection:\n– Histologically confirmed diagnosis of ccRCC \n– Availability of a diagnostic H&E-stained slide of the pri-\nmary carcinoma used for routine diagnosis\n– Information on survival status and survival/follow-up \ntime\nPatients/H&E slides were excluded for the following \nreasons:\n– H&E slide containing < 250 patches of ccRCC tissue of \nsufficient quality\nSince no direct information on DSS is available for the \nTCGA cohort, this information was obtained from a work \nthat developed a standardized data set for DSS using an \napproximation for the TCGA KIRC cohort [13]. For the vali-\ndation set, data for the type of death were obtained. Missing \ndata on DSS were only considered an exclusion criterion for \nthe DSS analysis and not for the OS analysis.\nThis study was approved by the local ethics committee \n(#2021-862-AF 11). Informed consent was waived for this \nretrospective analysis.\nStudy design\nAs depicted in Fig.  1, the basic principle of our method is \nto train the DINO-ViT model to extract feature vectors from \nthe images (Fig. 1A) followed by training a Cox regression \nmodel using the extracted feature vectors for prediction of \nOS and DSS (Fig.  1B), resulting in a low- and high-risk \nstratification. The trained DINO-ViT and Cox regression \nmodel was then externally validated using a set of our insti-\ntution (in-house).\nPre‑processing\nSlides from the Mannheim cohort were digitised with \n40-fold magnification using a Leica Aperio AT2 DX \n2235World Journal of Urology (2023) 41:2233–2241 \n1 3\nscanner, resulting in a whole slide images (WSIs) resolu-\ntion of 0.25 µm/px. WSIs from the TCGA-KIRC cohort were \ndownloaded from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data \nportal. For every WSI, tumour regions were annotated under \nexpert pathologists’ supervision (TG, ZP) and subsequently \ntessellated into downscaled square patches of 512px x 512px \nusing QuPath 0.2.3 [14]. The Macenko method was used for \nnormalising variances in staining colours [15]. Additionally, \nblur-detection was implemented in Python version 3.7.7.\nExtracting feature vectors using a DINO self‑supervised ViT\nDINO is a newly developed self-supervised learning method \n[11]. The uniqueness of DINO lies in the use of different \nimage transformations by applying techniques such as crop-\nping and performing the self-supervised learning process \nfrom these different presentations of the same image for \nall images in the dataset. This has proven to achieve more \nrobust underlying features DINO uses to represent the data-\nset. In this study, the dataset consisted of histological images \nof ccRCC. Thus, practically, the model was tasked to find \nrecurring structures in the histological images that define \nccRCC. Since these structures usually have different indi-\nvidual morphological manifestations which can be extracted \nby the model using a feature extractor, the output of this \narchitecture, a feature vector, should represent the histologi-\ncal variety of ccRCC. Similar to the original publication, a \nViT was used as a backbone for the DINO self-supervised \nlearning model. Using this architecture, the model can \nsegment the images and define boundaries. This informa-\ntion is stored and can be visualised in the built-in attention \nheads. Attention is a mechanism that allows the model to \nselectively focus on certain parts of the input image. Each \nattention head is responsible for computing a different type \nof attention, in our model translating to focusing on dif-\nferent parts of the image that the model considers to be of \nFig. 1  Workflow and study design. A The pre-processing of the \nincluded slides is shown. For each slide of the TCGA training and \nin-house test sets, patches were extracted from annotated tumour \nregions. The patches were used as input for the ViT which extracts \nimage features resulting in a feature vector of each patch. This was \ndone in an unsupervised manner, meaning no labels were provided in \nthe training of the ViT. B The resulting feature vectors were used as \ninput for the Cox-Hazard regression model. One model for each end-\npoint (OS and DSS) was trained, again using the TCGA cohort and \nthen tested on the in-house cohort. For the slide-level prediction, the \nscore per patch was averaged to calculate an average slide score\n2236 World Journal of Urology (2023) 41:2233–2241\n1 3\nimportance for the dataset. This Self-attention was thus used \nto attach weight to each region of an image and adjust the \nfeature extraction accordingly (Fig.  1A), a process that is \ncalled attention learning as part of the training of the model.\nThe model was trained for 300 epochs and used as a self-\nsupervised feature extractor. For each epoch, the model used \n1000 randomly sampled patches per WSI. During this pro-\ncess no label was provided. Finally, the model was used to \nextract a feature vector (384 × 1) for every patch from both \nthe TCGA-KIRC and Mannheim cohorts.\nCox regression model\nFor the survival analysis, the learned representations of \neach histological image, more specifically of every patch, \nwere used in the form of a feature vector, the output of the \nDINO-ViT model as described above. A Cox proportional \nhazard model was fitted to predict the endpoints OS and \nDSS using these feature vectors of every patch per WSI from \nthe TCGA-KIRC cohort. A cross-validation was conducted \nto determine the value of the parameter “penalizer” based \non the highest concordance index. The l1_ratio was set to \n1, resulting in a “Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection \nOperator” (LASSO) regression. The model was fitted for \nthe TCGA-KIRC cohort and used to predict a risk score \nfor every patch of a WSI. Subsequently, all patches of the \nsame WSI were averaged, resulting in a slide level prediction \n(Fig. 1B). The risk score represents the time to death. The \nmodel was trained using the TCGA cohort. The median of \nthe risk scores of all images in the training set was used as \na threshold to define low- and high-risk groups. The trained \nmodel was first evaluated on the TCGA training cohort and \nsecondly externally validated on unseen data using the vali-\ndation set from our institution. The median risk score was \nagain used as threshold for the stratification into low- and \nhigh-risk groups.\nStatistics\nA Kaplan–Meier estimator was used to calculate the survival \nfunction for both risk groups. A log-rank test determined \nthe difference between both groups. This was done on the \nTCGA training set and the external validation set after the \ntraining process was completed. To evaluate the significance \nand clinical relevance of the DINO-ViT-based survival pre-\ndiction, it was compared with already known prognostically \nrelevant clinicopathological parameters using multivariable \nCox hazard models. Hazard ratios, confidence intervals and \np values were calculated for each parameter included in the \nmultivariable prediction of OS and DSS. The included clini-\ncal variables were age, grading (G1/G2 vs. G3/G4), tumour \nstage (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4) and metastasis status (M+ vs. M–). \nCalculations were performed using JMP 15.2.1 (SAS Insti-\ntute, Cary, NC, USA).\nResults\nPatient population\n709 patients, with one corresponding WSI each, were \nincluded in this study. For DSS, n  = 7 patients were not \nincluded in the training TCGA set since no information \non DSS was available. Detailed patient characteristics are \nshown in Table 1.\nDINO‑ViT performance\nThe ViT low-risk group showed a significantly longer OS \ncompared to the high-risk group in the training set (log rank \ntest: p < 0.001). As shown in Fig.  2B, DSS in the low-risk \ngroup was also significantly longer (p < 0.001). In the valida-\ntion set, there was a significant difference between groups \nin OS (p < 0.005; Fig. 2C) and DSS (p < 0.001; Fig. 2D).\nTable 1  Patient cohorts\nG grading, IQR interquartile range, M metastasis, n number, TCGA  \nThe Cancer Genome Atlas\nVariable TCGA Mannheim validation\nPatients (n) 443 266\nAge (years)\n Median, IQR 61 (52–69) 64 (56–71)\nSex\n Male, n (%) 287 (65) 186 (70)\nTumour size\n pT1, n (%) 220 (50) 157 (59)\n pT2, n (%) 61 (14) 26 (10)\n pT3, n (%) 151 (34) 79 (30)\n pT4, n (%) 11 (2) 4 (1)\nGrading\n G1, n (%) 10 (2) 39 (15)\n G2, n (%) 181 (41) 207 (77)\n G3, n (%) 177 (40) 20 (7)\n G4, n (%) 72 (16) 0 (0)\n GX, n (%) 3 (1) 2 (1)\nMetastasis,\n M+, n (%) 70 (16) 26 (10)\nFollow-up\n Median follow-up, IQR \n(months)\n37 (17–62) 108 (78–124)\n Deaths during follow-up, n (%) 155 (35) 99 (37)\n2237World Journal of Urology (2023) 41:2233–2241 \n1 3\nSubgroup analysis\nThe established DINO-ViT risk stratification was also exam-\nined in patients with metastases only. With the threshold \ndefined in the training process for the entire cohort, a sig-\nnificant difference in the Kaplan–Meier analysis could also \nbe demonstrated for OS (log rank test: p  < 0.01) and DSS \n(p = 0.03) in the TCGA metastatic subgroup. In the small \nsubgroup of the validation set, no significant difference was \nfound for OS (p = 0.26) and DSS (p = 0.065).\nMultivariable analysis\nThe DINO-ViT risk group was an independent predictor of \nOS in the training set (hazard ratio [HR] 3.03; 95%-con-\nfidence interval [95%-CI] 2.11–4.35; p  < 0.01) but not in \nthe validation set (HR 1.25; 95%-CI 0.76–2.06; p  = 0.38; \nTable 2). Independent predictors in the validation set were \nage, grading, TNM tumour size, and the occurrence of \nmetastasis. DINO-ViT was an independent predictor of \nDSS in the training (HR 4.90; 95%-CI 2.78–8.64; p  < 0.01) \nand validation (HR 2.31; 95%-CI 1.15–4.65; p  = 0.02) sets. \nAgain, grading, tumour size, and metastasis were significant \npredictors of DSS.\nVisualisation of the DINO‑ViT attention heads\nHeads 1, 2, and 5 mainly focused on the peritumoural \nstroma, heads 3 and 4 highlighted the cytoplasm (Fig.  3). \nHead 3 seemed to focus more on the clear cell, whereas head \n4 more on the stained cytoplasm. Head 6 clearly focused \non the cell nuclei. The recurring identification of these \nstructures was quite evident and uniform for all four slides \ndemonstrating the capability of the DINO-ViT in identifying \nrecurrent structures within histological images.\nDiscussion\nIn this work, we investigated the combination of a ViT, \nself-supervised learning using DINO and a LASSO-Cox \nregression analysis to predict survival from H&E-stained \nFig. 2  Kaplan–Meier analysis for OS and DSS in the training and \nvalidation sets.

A significant uni- \nand multivariable risk stratification was achieved with the \ntraining set. The prediction of DSS also remained significant \nin multivariable analysis in the validation cohort.\nThe DINO-ViT architecture [ 11] was chosen mainly \nbecause this model learns recurring structures and image \nfeatures independently of a pre-defined task. In principle, \nthese features can, therefore, be used for many different tasks \nand a prediction model can be selected depending on the \ndesired outcome. This approach provides robustness in out-\nof-distribution data. A similar approach was used by Chen \net al. [16]. Here, extracted pre-defined image features were \nused in a diagnostic and a survival prediction model. The \npositive results of both studies demonstrate the multiplicity \nof tasks that can be performed with such architectures.\nThe positive results in univariable analysis show that the \nrecurrent image features identified by DINO-ViT have prog-\nnostic relevance. Here, the question arises as to the extent at \nwhich the identified structures correspond to known path-\nological risk factors. Tumour size and grading have been \nshown to be significant prognostic factors for survival in \nRCC [17–19]. The results of multivariable analyses under -\nline that our model can extract additional information from \nthe histological tumour sections than can be achieved with \nthe current pathological classifications, at least for the \nendpoint DSS. Even in subgroup analysis, including only \npatients with metastases, the model achieved a significant \nDSS and OS risk stratification in this high-risk population \nin the TCGA cohort, although it was not designed for this \npurpose and the threshold was not adapted. Probably due to \nthe low number of patients, in the external validation cohort, \nthere was no significant difference, although a trend for a \nmeaningful stratification was seen for DSS. To develop a \nmetastasis-specific model using this AI-architecture thus \nseems to be promising.\nVisualisation of the ViTs attention heads demonstrated \nthat the model identified structures similar to the traditional \nconcept of pathological assessment [17]. The possible \nadvantage may be that subtle differences in cell or nucleus \nsize and shape might be captured that are not represented \nin the established classifications, such as grading G1-G4. \nSeveral studies indicate that automated grading in RCC \nTable 2  Multivariable OS and \nDSS Cox Hazard model\n95%-CI 95% confidence interval, DINO self-distillation with no labels, DSS disease-specific survival, G \ngrading, M metastasis, OS overall survival, TCGA  The Cancer Genome Atlas, ViT vision transformer\nHazard ratio 95%-CI p value\nOverall survival\n Training set\n  Age (continuous) 1.03 1.01–1.04  < 0.01\n  Grading (G3/G4 vs. G1/G2) 1.42 0.96–2.09 0.08\n  Tumour size (T3/T4 vs. T1/T2) 1.41 0.97–2.07 0.07\n  Metastasis (M+ vs. M–) 2.69 1.85–3.92  < 0.01\n  DINO-ViT risk group (High vs. Low) 3.03 2.11–4.35  < 0.01\n Validation set\n  Age (continuous) 1.04 1.02–1.06  < 0.01\n  Grading (G3/G4 vs. G1/G2) 3.41 1.79–6.50  < 0.01\n  Tumour size (T3/T4 vs. T1/T2) 1.76 1.14–2.74 0.01\n  Metastasis (M+ vs. M–) 4.22 2.44–7.29  < 0.01\n  DINO-ViT risk group (High vs. Low) 1.25 0.76–2.06 0.38\nDisease specific survival\n Training set\n  Age (continuous) 1.01 0.99–1.03 0.40\n  Grading (G3/G4 vs. G1/G2) 2.14 1.22–3.76 0.01\n  Tumour size (T3/T4 vs. T1/T2) 1.61 0.98–2.65 0.06\n  Metastasis (M+ vs. M–) 4.01 2.57–6.24  < 0.01\n  DINO-ViT risk group (High vs. Low) 4.90 2.78–8.64  < 0.01\n Validation set\n  Age (continuous) 0.98 0.95–1.01 0.22\n  Grading (G3/G4 vs. G1/G2) 3.70 1.71–7.99  < 0.01\n  Tumour size (T3/T4 vs. T1/T2) 3.48 1.72–7.05  < 0.01\n  Metastasis (M+ vs. M–) 6.5 3.32–12.75  < 0.01\n  DINO-ViT risk group (High vs. Low) 2.31 1.15–4.65 0.02\n2239World Journal of Urology (2023) 41:2233–2241 \n1 3\nmay provide a prognostically more relevant grading than \nmanual grading [20, 21]. It has also been shown that certain \ngenetic changes can manifest themselves in different pheno-\ntypic expressions, for example leading to differences in the \ncytoplasm or the stroma in ccRCC [22]. It has already been \nshown that several mutations in different cancer types can \nbe detected on the H&E slide by AI [23, 24]. Additionally, \nstandardisation and lack of interobserver variability might \nimprove the predictive ability.\nDINO-ViT thus has the potential to contribute to \nimproved cancer outcome prediction, for example as part \nof a multivariable prediction model by adding DINO-ViT \nto an existing model or developing a new, even completely \nAI-based multivariable prediction model.\nSimilar works\nWulczyn et al. achieved similar results on the TCGA-KIRC \ncohort for predicting DSS using a convolutional neural net-\nwork (CNN) designed to predict survival data [7]. A signifi-\ncant risk stratification into three risk groups was achieved \nwhich remained significant in multivariable analysis (HR \n1.88; p < 0.01) in addition to the tumour stage (HR 3.20; \np < 0.01) while age was not a significant predictor. Inter -\nestingly, four other tumour types across the TCGA cohorts \nshowed significant DSS prediction with Wulczyns’s model \narchitecture, while in five other cancer types, such as blad-\nder cancer, no significant DSS prediction was achieved. \nTabibu et al. developed a method in which shape features \nwere extracted from RCC histopathology images and sub-\nsequently tested for their predictive value of OS [25]. In \nmultivariable analysis, it remained a significant predictor \n(HR 2.27; p < 0.01). In contrast to work presented here, no \nexternal validation was performed in either study and thus, \nthe robustness and generalisability on unseen data of these \ninteresting architectures remains unclear. An externally \nvalidated method was developed by Chen et al. as described \nabove [16]. The LASSO-Cox model showed a significant \npredictive ability in the validation cohort in multivariable \nanalysis. In contrast to our study, however, the extracted \nimage features were defined beforehand, while the DINO-\nViT model has the potential to use image structures that \nhave not yet been considered relevant. Additionally, the risk \nscore threshold used for dividing the cohorts into low- and \nhigh-risk groups was calculated individually in the training \nand validation sets. In our study, the threshold was defined \nin the training set and this threshold was used for the exter-\nnal validation set since a cohort-specific threshold defini-\ntion significantly increases the risk of overfitting and might \noverestimate external applicability.\nLimitations\nThe retrospective design of our study is the major limitation \nof this work. Additionally, a larger dataset is necessary to \nenhance the robustness of our algorithm. Also, the clinical \ndata appears very robust in the prediction of survival, thus \nthe benefit of adding an AI model is not certain in this regard \nand requires further evaluation. While the TCGA-KIRC \ncohort has proven very useful in recent years, it has some \nshortcomings in the clinical follow-up data. The follow-up \ntime was shorter with a median of 37 months than in our \ncohort (108 months). A longer follow-up would have helped \ntraining the Cox hazard model more accurately. Addition-\nally, for TCGA-KIRC data on DSS is incomplete and an \nestablished approximation of DSS had to be used. Again, \nmore accurate data might have resulted in an even more \nrobust model. However, the successful external validation \nFig. 3  Visualisation of the DINO-ViT attention heads.

Thus, if \nthis model is improved further and our early results can be \nconfirmed in a prospective evaluation, clinical implementa-\ntion as an assessment tool to guide therapy or follow-up \nintervals might be feasible with the goal of advancing cur -\nrent clinicopathological paradigms.\nAcknowledgements The results are in part based upon data gener -\nated by the TCGA Research Network: https:// www. cancer. gov/ tcga. \nWe would especially like to thank all the patients, donors, and research \ngroups who contributed to TCGA.\nAuthor contributions FW had full access to all the data in the study \nand takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy \nof the data analysis.
