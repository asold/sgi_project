Regional-\nscale landslide models primarily rely on shaking intensity parameters obtained by simplifying ground\nmotion time-series into peak scalar values. Such an approach neglects the contribution of ground\nmotion phase and amplitude and their variations over space and time. Here, we address this problem\nby developing an explainable deep-learning model able to treat the entire waveﬁeld and benchmark it\nagainst a model equipped with scalar intensity parameters. The experiments run on the area affected\nby the 2015 M\nw7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake reveal a 16% improvement in predictive capacity when\nincorporating full waveforms. This improvement is achieved mainly on gentle (~25°) hillslopes exposed\nto low ground shaking (~0.2 m/s). Moreover, we can largely attribute this improvement to the ground\nmotion before and much after the peak velocity arrival. This underscores the limits of single-intensity\nmeasures and the untapped potential of full waveform information.\nEarthquakes can cause hundreds of thousands of landslides, and in some\ncases, the losses may exceed those directly associated with the ground\nshaking1. This hazard chain takes place in just few minutes as the waveﬁeld\ntransits and interacts with the terrain, leading to widespread slope\ninstabilities. Such short-term interactions can have repercussions lasting\ntens of years2. Therefore, understanding the failure mechanisms within\nthose few minutes is vital to foresee the full chain of events2– 4.\nPhysics-based and data-driven solutions2 encompass most of the\navailable coseismic landslide models. Physics-based ones rely on geo-\ntechnical data, information hardly accessible for regional scale\nassessments\n5. Therefore, the main difference between these two\napproaches resides in theﬂexibility of data-driven models to be applied\nfor regional or even global scale analyses. As for the physics-based\ncategory, Jibson\n5 mainly divides them into three alternatives: pseudo-\nstatic, stress-deformation, and permanent-deformation5. Permanent-\ndeformation techniques such as the Newmark 6 method and its\nsimpliﬁcations7 are most commonly used for regional coseismic landslide\nmodeling. This approach identiﬁes critical acceleration thresholds in the\nground motion signal, above which a given slope exhibits permanent\ndeformation. This framework assumes that the main factors responsible\nfor higher slope deformation are large amplitude and duration of\nshaking\n8. The main limitation in the applicability of the Newmark\nmethod is in the sparse density9 of seismic stations. Therefore, spatially\ncontinuous records of ground motion data cannot be retrieved even in\ntectonically active regions, where dense seismic networks are deployed9,10.\nD a t a - d r i v e na p p r o a c h e so f f e ra na l ternative by using proxies rather\nthan parameters requiredin physics-based methods11. Statistical methods\nsuch as binomial Generalized Linear12 and Additive13 Models reﬂect most of\nthe literature until recently when they shared the stage with machine\nlearning\n14 approaches. Overall, data-driven models perform analogous\noperations, where a set of explanatory variables is used to optimize the\nnumerical distinction between slopesthat have failed in response to ground\nshaking and those that did not. To date, data-driven approaches incorporate\nseveral ground motion intensity parameters such as peak ground velocity\n(PGV), acceleration (PGA), or Arias intensity\n2. Dahal et al.15 use synthetic\nwaveforms to test 28 ground motion parameters and demonstrate that\nfrequency content, total shaking, and duration can complement the infor-\nmation usually carried by peak proxies.However, even these parameters still\nconvey a scalar representation of the full waveform, and they do not reﬂect\nthe characteristics of seismic waves (e.g., frequency content and duration)\nthat may play a role in the occurrence of landslides.\nThe problem of suitably exploiting time series exists across all scientiﬁc\nﬁelds. For instance, a branch of machine learning known as natural language\nprocessing has been developed to recognize important characteristics in the\ncontinuous signal of written and spoken language. The two most common\nsolutions correspond to long short-term memory\n16 (known as LSTM) and\n1University of Twente, Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), PO Box 217 Enschede, AE 7500, Netherlands.\ne-mail: a.dahal@utwente.nl\nCommunications Earth & Environment|            (2024) 5:75 1\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\ngated recurrent units17 (known as GRU). However, both have limits in\ncapturing long-range dependencies in time-series data because of their\nsequential processing nature\n18– 20. In other words, their structure sequentially\nprocesses the signal, and the inﬂuence estimated at each step is a priori\nconstrained to decay over time. Thus, both models tend to forget the con-\ntribution coming from portions of the time sequence that are far away from\neach other. In geoscience, these models have been demonstrated to be\nconvenient in the context of long-term precipitation analysis and associated\nlandslides because they naturally reﬂect the different contributions coming\nfrom early preparatory\n21 and triggering22 precipitation. However, in the\ncontext of earthquake-induced landslides, the energy released by an earth-\nquake propagates on very short timescales, making sequential models\nunsuited to treat an impulsive signal.\nConversely, a transformer architecture relies on an attention\nmechanism\n23 capable of looking at portions oft h et i m es e r i e sw i t h o u tp r i o r\nassumptions on how certain information should be forgotten moving away\nfrom the start of the sequence24. Due to theirﬂexibility, transformers have\nbecome a staple in computer vision25,26, natural language processing27 and\nconstitute the fundamental backbone of the famous ChatGPT model\nseries28.\nTherefore, here, we aim to remove any scalar simpliﬁcation require-\nment and implement a modeling architecture capable of interpreting the\nground motion time series as a whole. For this reason, we designed an\nexperiment where the prediction of coseismic landslides is tasked to a\ntransformer architecture fed with full waveform. We also translated the\nmodel results to examine which segments of the synthetic waveforms carry\nrelevant information for landslide hazard assessment. This model is\nbenchmarked against a standard scalar counterpart to test whether the use\nof full waveforms is useful in theﬁrst place.\nThe study area where we run our experiment corresponds to the\nNepalese landscape struck by the 7.8 M\nw Gorkha Earthquake in 2015, for\nwhich ground motion simulations15, landslide inventory29, terrain30,a n d\ngeological31 data are available. The earthquake occurred along the Main\nHimalayan Thrust (MHT) fault, and the hypocentre is located in the\nNorthwestern sector (Fig.1). The unilateral rupture propagated 110° east,\nlasting for ~50 s\n32, and the strike and dip of the fault was 293° and 7°,\nrespectively33. Overall, more than 8,800 people were lost, with 23,000\ninjured34, followed by widespread infrastructural damage. An area of\n28,344 km2 was scanned, and a polygonal inventory containing 24,990\ncoseismic landslides associated with this event was mapped (Fig.1)29.W e\ndeﬁned our experiment over the same region to ensure the validity of\nlandslide presence/absence information and obtained ground motion data\nfrom the simulations made by Dahal et al.15. The authors simulated the\nGorkha earthquake by using theﬁn i t ef a u l tm o d e lb u i l tb yW e ie ta l .35,\nincluding the 3D topography through Salvus36,37. The 1D velocity structure\nis the same as proposed by Mahesh et al.38 with a mesh capable of simulating\nup to 3.0 Hz, although the waveforms wereﬁltered down to 1.5 Hz due to the\nlimitations in subsurface data andﬁnite fault model.\nUsing the simulation by Dahal et al.15, full waveforms were extracted at\nthe crown of each landslide reported by Roback et al.29.T h e s el o c a t i o n s\nconstituted our landslide presence data. In binary classiﬁcation, it is also\nnecessary to extract the landslide absence information39. Therefore, we\nextracted a random and equal number ofstable slopes at least steeper than\n10° and located 500 m away from a failed slope. The combination of\nlandslide presence and absence will constitute the modeling target of our\nanalyses.\nResults\nBenchmarking\nWe recall that our transformer model is equipped with a full waveform time\nseries (Mod1) and that we benchmarked its outputs against a standard\nmodel that simpliﬁes the ground motion into its peak velocity (Mod2). The\ndifference between the two is signiﬁcant, as demonstrated by a 22% increase\nin performance. To enrich our experiment, we also added terrain and\nlithological information to the two models above (i.e., Mod3 and Mod4,\nrespectively). As a result, the performance observed in Mod1 (AUC = 0.94)\nincreased to 0.96 in Mod3. As for the jump from Mod2 to Mod4, this\ntranslated into a performance of 0.72 and 0.80, respectively. Therefore, even\nthe more complex benchmark still showed an overall improvement of 16%\nbetween Mod3 and Mod4 (Fig.2a).\nA similar modeling performance among the four models is also\nmaintained when examining accuracy, intersection over union (IOU), and\nF1 scores (Fig.2b). Mod2 and Mod4 appear signiﬁcantly less capable of\ndistinguishing failed slopes compared to Mod1 and Mod3, respectively.\nAlso, the role of terrain and lithological characteristics led to a larger per-\nformance increase from Mod2 to Mod4(i.e., 8%) rather than from Mod1 to\nMod3 (i.e., 2%), likely because the latter can already rely on a large amount of\ninformation carried by the full waveforms.\nAside from the performance metrics, we also presented the spatial\npattern of landslide probabilities for each model (Fig.3). The output of\nMod2 appears spatially smoothed (Fig.3b). Even when including terrain\nand lithology, Mod4 still exhibits a smooth spatial pattern (Fig.3d) repre-\nsented by smeared values that are in the medium to small range without a\nclear distinction between landslide and non-landslide locations. Actually,\nFig. 1 | Study area, ground motion simulation\nextent, and observed landslides. aDashed polygon\nshows the ground motion simulation domain\ndeﬁned by Dahal et al.15; the black solid polygon\nrepresents the study area where Roback et al.29 per-\nformed the landslide mapping.

As a\nresult, Mod4 largely overestimates slope instabilities in the north-east and\nnorth-west sectors, an effect thatw a sn o tp r e s e n ti nt h es i m p l e rM o d 2 .\nDespite the spatial differences, another element of concern in both Mod2\nand Mod4 is in their range of probabilities, which is biased toward small and\nmedium values.\nThe use of full waveforms in Mod1 (Fig.3a) largely addresses both\nissues mentioned above. The landslide predictive pattern appears less\nsmooth, and the probability contrastbetween stable and unstable slopes\nbecomes much more evident (the range now extends from 0 to 1). Another\ncharacteristic is that probabilistically unstable slopes cluster at the center of\nthe study area. However, this sector unrealistically appears homogeneously\nunstable. Only in Mod3 (Fig.3c), combining terrain and lithology to the full\nwaveforms’ information, do the predictive patterns reach their best\nexpression among all models.\nExplainability\nIn the previous section, we acknowledged that the best performance metrics\nare obtained for Mod3. In this section, we will explore the reasons\nbehind such a result, comparing Mod3 against its simpler version, Mod4.\nTo do so, we identiﬁed failed slopes to which both models assigned\nlandslide occurrence probability equal to or greater than 0.5, or\n(p Mod4hi ≥ 0:5 ^ p Mod3hi ≥ 0:5jy ¼ 1). These are unstable slopes cor-\nrectly classiﬁed by both Mod3 and Mod4. Similarly, we checked failed slopes\nthat only Mod3 was able to characterize with a probability equal to or greater\nthan 0.5, or (p Mod4hi <0 :5 ^ p Mod3hi ≥ 0:5jy ¼ 1). These are unstable\nslopes correctly classiﬁed only by Mod3. In Fig.4,w ep l o te a c ho ft h et w o\nrespective groups (panels a– ca n dd– f) according to the results obtained for\nthe three main directions: East– West, North– South, and Up– Down. Along\nthe y-axis, we present the 2-dimensionalhistogram of the explainability\nscore generated by Mod3 for each time step of all waveforms, shown along\nthe abscissa. The explainability score quantiﬁes each time step’sc o n t r i b u -\ntion with respect to theﬁnal landslide occurrence probability. Thex-axis is\norganized according to the PGV arrival (set at zero and symbolized with the\nsolid purple line).\nThe ﬁrst observation to be made is that in both cases, the direction\nwhere most of the explainability is scored corresponds to East-West, which\nis also the main direction of the rupture propagation during the Gorkha\nearthquake. The most important element to be stressed is the comparison\nbetween the E– W direction belonging to panels a and d. In theﬁrst case,\nwhere both Mod3 and Mod4 correctly perform, most of the yellow grids (the\nfrequency of explainability scores) cluster around the PGV arrival. This is\nactually why the two models agree, as even a scalar representation of the full\nwaveform would point at this approximate portion of the signal without\nrelying on the information coming from the rest of the waveform. However,\nthe situation is very different in panel d, where only Mod3 suitably\nrecognizes landslides. There, the explainability scores shown in panel d do\nnot only cluster around the PGV arrivala ss h o w ni np a n e la .C o n v e r s e l y ,t h e\nexplainability is shown to be densely distributed over most of the time series,\neven ~120 to ~160 s after the PGV.\nThis observation requires further investigation into what it potentially\nimplies numerically, geographically, physically, and geomorphologically.\nNumerically, Mod4 is blind to the occurrence of 5260 landslides (or 21.26%\nwith respect to the total). Conversely, Mod3 only misses 2059 landslides (or\n8.32% with respect to the total) and captures 3201 landslides that Mod4\nmisses. As for what this translates in terms of landslide area, Mod4 captures\nlandslides that failed up to 8.4 km\n2 as compared to the 11.1 km2 estimated by\nMod3. Notably, the observed total failed surface is equal to 11.7 km2.T h u s ,\nMod4 misses ~28% of the failed surface, whereas Mod3 only misses ~5%.\nLooking more into the extremes of the landslide area distribution, above the\n95\nth percentile, Mod4 identiﬁes landslides with an area of ~3700 m2, whereas\nthe same estimated by Mod3 is ~4300 m2. The observed reference is\n4315.99 m2. We also explore frequency area distributions40 in Supplemen-\ntary Fig. 1, observing a higher capacity of Mod3 to predict the two tails of the\ndistribution as compared to Mod4.\nExtending the investigation towards geographic implications, we plot\nthe landslide probability difference (Mod3– Mod4) in Fig.4g. There, both\nmodels agree at locations highlighted in yellow (probability difference ~0)\nand disagree wherever the map presents blue (Mod4 > Mod3) and red\ncolors (Mod3 > Mod4). Interestingly, the highest positive differences in\nprobability (Mod3 > Mod4) cluster along topographic incisions (valleys)\nrunning roughly orthogonal to the Himalayan direction.\nAs for the physical meaning behind Mod3 and Mod4 differences, we\nrevise the idea behind Fig.4, leave behind probabilistic considerations, and\nfocus on failed slopes. In Fig.5, we select two representative slopes correctly\nclassiﬁed by both Mod3 and Mod4, and two slopes only failed according to\nMod3. In such a way, we graphically present the actual waveforms (gray\nlines) against their site-speciﬁc Mod3 scores, exploring potential physical\nconsiderations.\nPanels a and b show that landslides recognized by both Mod3 and\nMod4 exhibit the largest explainability score (green line) close to the PGV\n(zero along the abscissa). The situation appears very different for landslides\nonly predicted by Mod3. Panel c of Fig.5 shows two large explainability\nscores in the early stages of the waveform. Theﬁrst one is well aligned with\nthe P wave arrival time, an observation that could indicate the ability of our\ntransformer model to capture the inﬂuence of waveform phases. Panel d of\nFig. 5 depicts another situation where the explainability scores in the early\nstages of the waveform are relatively low, and a peak score is visible around\n150 seconds after the PGV. These results highlight the inadequate capacity\nof PGV to reﬂect inﬂuences across the full waveform and, in turn, the limited\ncapacity to explain the whole coseismic landslide population. This also\nmeans that the Mod3 extracts valuable information from the full waveform,\ntowards which Mod4 is blind.\nFig. 2 | Performance evaluation of the models.\na Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves\nand b full suite of examined metrics, including the\narea under the curve (AUC), accuracy score (ACC),\nintersection over union (IOU) and F1 score.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01243-8 Article\nCommunications Earth & Environment|            (2024) 5:75 3\nTo conclude the investigation, we explore the geomorphological dif-\nferences between Mod3 and Mod4 (Fig.5e ) .T h e r e ,w ep l o tl a n d s l i d e\nlocations correctly predicted by both (in green) and those only recognized\nby Mod3 (in red). Landslides located by Mod3 occur on a gentler topo-\ngraphy (Fig.5f, maximum density at 30°) and with a lower shaking (Fig.5g,\nmaximum density at 0.2 m/s) compared to landslides predicted by both\nmodels (maxima at 40° and 0.4 m/s, respectively). Along the same reason-\ning, we also classiﬁed the Nepalese landforms\n41 and checked which type is\nassociated with the most misclassiﬁcations in Mod4 (Fig.5h). Open and\nupper slopes, midslope, and high ridges are also well represented in Mod4.\nHowever, Mod4 fails to predict failuresat locations close to valleys, stream\nslopes, and midslope drainages. These are otherwise well recognized as\nunstable by Mod3.\nOverall, these results imply that landslides on less susceptible hillslopes\ncan be more successfully predicted by exploiting the full waveform infor-\nmation. Conversely, landslides triggered on high susceptible hillslopes (i.e.,\ncharacterized by steep topography and high ground shaking) are already\npredictable using traditional peak intensity parameters. The realization of\nFig. 3 | Spatial distribution of the model outputs together with observed landslides, relief, and peak ground velocity.Mod1 to Mod4 output converted in map form\n(panels a– d).

Thus, predicting that\nlocation should not require large modeling efforts, and the less susceptible\nslopes should rather be the target.\nDiscussion\nTraditionally, data-driven coseismic landslide modeling approaches have\nalways focused on ground motion intensity parameters2.T h e s ea r e\nessentially single scalar representations of the whole seismic sequence42.I n\nturn, this has hindered considerations of the full characteristics of seismic\nsignals. Even though intensity parameters carry important information\nabout the seismic waveforms, they cannot accurately inform about the phase\nand amplitude and their temporal variations during the earthquake\npropagation\n43.\nOur ﬁndings based on the coseismic landslides triggered by the 2015\nGorkha earthquake showed that the full waveform information translates\nFig. 4 | Difference in explainability scores and predicted probability between\nstatic and full waveform models.Explainability scores for all slopes in the study area\nwere correctly classiﬁed by Mod3 and Mod4 (panelsa– c), and failed slopes were\nrecognized only by Mod3 (panelsd– f).

When exploring\nthis theme further, what stood out is that Mod3 and Mod4 mostly agree in\nthe northern sector of the earthquake-affected area. As for the slopes below\nthe high mountain range, in particular, the use of PGV is not enough. Mod4\nproduces very smooth predictive patterns, underestimating the middle\nsection of the Himalayan topographic proﬁle and overestimating failures in\nsafe locations. Notably, also the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) near-real-\ntime system\n44 seems to overpredict coseismic landslides45.\nFig. 5 | Evaluation of landslide predictions in relation to ground motion data and\ngeomorphological characterstics.Panels a– d present the Mod3 scores against the\nsynthetic waveforms.

Looking into what is\navailable at the USGS ShakeMap service\n46, some parameters constitute the\nstandard for the coseismic landslide community44,47, and they are usually\navailable in multiple versions, one empirically generated right after a major\nearthquake and few updates as more data becomes available with time48.\nHere, we opt to benchmark Mod3 against an equivalent that uses PGA and\nPGV, both in theirﬁrst (2015) and last (2020) updated versions48.M o r e o v e r ,\nwe also include two more tests that look back at the original simulations\nfrom Dahal et al.\n15.T h eﬁrst one calculates Arias Intensity49,50, a common\nscalar proxy for amplitude and duration and widely used for coseismic\nlandslide prediction\n51. The second one makes use of the full waveforms, like\nin Mod3, butﬁlters out frequencies above 0.5 Hz. The rationale behind the\nlatter is to include a sensitivity analysis. All the corresponding results are\nreported in Table1. There, Mod3 outperforms all the alternatives across all\nmetrics. The two pairs of USGS intensity parameters perform between ~8%\nand 13% worse than our Mod3. An even greater loss in performance is seen\nwith Arias Intensity, likely because the synthetic waveforms do not contain\nhigh frequencies. For the very same reason, we interpret the minimal per-\nformance loss over theﬁltered waveforms. Furthermore, it is also interesting\nthat Mod4 performs worse than the analogous equipped with ShakeMap\nintensity parameters. This demonstrates that the inclusion of high fre-\nquencies adds valuable information in the case of a scalar model. Never-\ntheless, this performance is still far from what full waveforms can achieve.\nMoving away from performance-oriented considerations, Mod3\nassigns its largest scores both close to the time of the peak velocity arrival and\nfar from it. Determining which physical information corresponds to these\nportions of the ground motion sequence is not straightforward. Mod3\ncaptures the E-W direction as responsible for most instabilities (see Fig.4,\npanels a and d). This is reasonable as it aligns well with the Main Himalayan\nThrust rupture, oriented at 110°.\nLooking at single slopes such as in Fig.5 (panels c and d), our trans-\nformer seems to highlight the importance of speciﬁcs e c t i o n so ft h ef u l l\nwaveform, these being potentially linked to the phase information, the\ninteractions with topography, and surface wave arrival. We recall here that\ndeep learning architectures are highlynonlinear and transform the available\ninformation into features from which a clear interpretation becomes\nchallenging\n52. Therefore, the considerations we present below correspond to\nour understanding, something usually referred to as attribution in the\nliterature\n53,54. For instance, Fig.5 shows explainability scores that mark\nspeciﬁcs e c t i o n so ft h ef u l lw a v e f o r m .P a n el c highlights two explainability\npeaks very close to each other, one reasonably well aligned with the P phase\narrival and one most likely with the S. This could be interpreted as the effect\nof two very different motion patternsaffecting a given hillslope almost\nsimultaneously. However, this could be the result of a number of inter-\npretations. This is also the case for panel d. There, despite the similarity of\nthe waveform with the one mentioned above, a relatively smaller explain-\nability score can be seen in the early stages, followed by a much larger one in\nthe late stages. This could be due to the different terrain and geological\ncharacteristics of the two sites, as well as the total shaking duration effect. A\nquick shaking, as intense as it may be,could still leave a slope unfailed.\nConversely, a prolonged yet milder shaking could bring a slope to the brink\nof failure.\nFocusing on the portion of the landscape these slopes occupy, Fig.5\n(panels f and g), a static PGV model identiﬁes coseismic failures in slopes\naround 40° steep and with peak velocities of around 0.5 m/s (i.e., open and\nupper slopes, midslope and high ridges). Yet, slightly gentler slopes 30° with\npeak velocities centered around 0.25 m/s) are only predicted when using full\nwaveforms, highlighting Mod3’s ability to predict failures occurring in the\nproximity of midslope drainages, valleys, and streams. These landforms,\nespecially if far away from the source,only fail when considering the whole\nground motion signal.\nAlthough these are interesting observations, they still do not support\nnear-real-time landslide hazard assessment tools. A number of reasons\nmake this the case. Firstly, ground motion simulations require a relatively\nlong time to generate, even when using high-performance computing\nfacilities. Secondly, a good earthquake rupture model is usually not available\nright after an earthquake, thus limiting the quality of the synthetic wave-\nforms. In relation to the quality, more could be said because coseismic\nlandslides may also occur due to topographic ampliﬁcation, a phenomenon\nthat is dependent on the interaction between earthquake and landscape\ncharacteristics\n55. Therefore, to obtain a reliable description of the process, a\n3D subsurface velocity structure, as wellas the geotechnical characterization\nof the study area, may be required.\nTherefore, in light of near-real-time requirements for disaster rescue\noperations, our Mod3 is still unsuitable at the current state of technology.\nThis implies that we are and will still likely be largely dependent on peak-\nintensity models in the future to help mountainous communities that have\nsuffered a large earthquake in a timely manner. However, further devel-\nopment to produce more reliable and fast ground motion simulations would\ndeﬁnitely help make our approach operational.\nAlternatively, scenarios could also be built prior to an earthquake\noccurrence. One could simulate several theoretical earthquakes and use the\nsynthetic waveforms to obtain coseismic landslide scenarios that could\nbe stored in an emergency response system\n56. Then, if and when an earth-\nquake of similar characteristics would take place, the predicted scenario\ncould be used to strategize disaster relief actions. The main limitations would\nboil down to the requirements for the numerical reproduction of shaking,\nespecially in data-scare regions. In fact, the rupture geometry, energy release,\nand the subsurface structure are fundamental requirements for a reliable\nground motion simulation. There are already challenges for data-rich\nsituations, and they would become less and less reliable in regions with\nproportionally less information available.\nAnother fundamental element to be explored in the future lies in the\nsize of coseismic landslides and the dependence on the full waveform\ncharacteristics. Frequency content and duration of ground shaking may\nalter the size of coseismic landslides\n57. For instance, higher frequencies exit\nhillslopes to the point of releasing small failures, and low frequencies exit\nmuch larger landslide bodies58,59. These arguments are not been tested yet in\nregional scale assessments exploiting the full waveforms. And yet, our results\nshow that the use of full waveforms could enable a better prediction of\nlandslide sizes and with it, the threat they pose to mountainous\ncommunities.\nAside from the long-term potential, the overarching theme related to\nthe use of full waveforms to estimate coseismic landslides is where we believe\nresearch should mostly be dedicated to in the coming years. Future steps\nshould involve testing a similar framework for different terrains, earthquake\nTable 1 | Model performance compared to multiple benchmark datasets\nModel\nUSGS PGV (2015) USGS PGV (2020) USGS PGA (2015) USGS PGA (2020) Arias Intensity Filtered Frequency Mod3 Mod4\nMetric AUC 0.86 0.83 0.88 0.88 0.82 0.95 0.96 0.80\nAccuracy 0.77 0.76 0.79 0.80 0.73 0.88 0.89 0.72\nIOU 0.64 0.64 0.67 0.67 0.55 0.80 0.81 0.59\nF1 score 0.78 0.78 0.80 0.81 0.71 0.89 0.90 0.74\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01243-8 Article\nCommunications Earth & Environment|            (2024) 5:75 7\nmagnitudes, and rupture mechanisms. If analogous conclusions could be\nreached for different contexts, then the knowledge obtained could deﬁnitely\nbe translated into better disaster responses in mountainous regions affected\nby large earthquakes.\nMethods\nThe model in this study incorporates the entire ground-motion signal with\nmorphometric parameters with a modiﬁed transformer neural network to\ninclude the terrain and lithological factors. In addition, we developed an\nexplainable AI approach that enablesus to understand how the model uses\nwaveform information to predict landslides. This method allows both\nwaveform and other predisposing conditions to be considered simulta-\nneously. We then compared our model with three different models\n(benchmark models, see Table2), which included intensity parameters and\nremoved morphometry. The tested benchmark models included ground\nmotion waveform only (Mod1), peak ground velocity only (Mod2), terrain,\nlithology, and ground motion waveform (Mod3), terrain, lithology, and\npeak ground velocity (Mod4). Furthermore, we developed an explainable\nartiﬁcial intelligence approach to understand the role of ground motion\nsignals. The following section will further explain the details of each\ndeveloped method.\nModel deﬁnition and training\nThe existing transformer models25,60 only work with waveform data and do\nnot include static variables, which are more common in geoscientiﬁcp r o -\nblems. In earth surface processes, many parameters are temporally varying\n(dynamic), whereas some stay the sameover human timescale (static). In\nour case, ground motion is a dynamic variable, whereas the terrain prop-\nerties are static. To resolve this problem, we modiﬁed the vanilla transformer\nneural network from Vaswani et al.\n60 to include static covariates.\nLandslides (Ls ; tðÞ ) are a spatiotemporal processes that are considered\nstochastic for modeling purposes61. In this case, let us assume that the\nlandslide is a stochastic spatial processLsðÞðÞ because we do not consider the\nmultiple time frames to model a spatio-temporal process. Being a binary\nvariable, a landslide can be represented by Bernoulli distribution as:\nLsðÞ ∼Ber psðÞ\n/C0/C1\nWhere the probability of landslidepsðÞ2 0; 1ðÞ is what we try to estimate as\na landslide susceptibility. For this, thelandslide susceptibility is a function of\ndifferent terrain and geologic as well as seismic variables. The main dis-\ntinction between those two variables are that terrain and geologic factors are\nstatic and does not change during an earthquake event while the seismic\nenergy is dynamic and changes over the time. Therefore, we can deﬁne them\nas static covariates X\nS sðÞ¼ xS sðÞ and dynamic covariates as\nXD s; tðÞ ¼ xD s; tðÞ . Now the landslide susceptibility, de ﬁned by the\nprobability of occurrence of landslide is given by: psðÞ¼ Pr 2\nð0; 1Þ : PrfLsðÞ¼ 1jXs sðÞ¼ xs; XD s; tðÞ ¼ xD s; tðÞ g .T om o d e lt h i sw eu s e\nthe deep learning model which will represent the potentially highly non-\nlinear function which estimatespsðÞ given the input variables.\nNow, to design the deep learning model, let the encoding part of the\ntransformer model from Vaswani et al.\n60 beτ s;tðÞ .T h ef u n c t i o nτ s;tðÞ takes the\ninput dataXD s; tðÞ and generates feature space over the spatial domain s as\nf 1 sðÞ ¼ τ s;tðÞ XD s;tðÞðÞ , where all the processing for dynamic data occurs, such\nas multi-head attention and positional encoding. Then, let us assume there is\na deep neural networkδ\nsðÞ , which is a function of static covariatesXsðÞ ¼ xs\nand produces the feature spacef 2 sðÞ ¼ δ sðÞ Xs sðÞ¼ xs\n/C0/C1\n. We concatenate\nboth feature spaces into one tensorf 3ðsÞ ¼ f 1ðsÞ /C8 f 2ðsÞ,w h i c hi st h e n\npassed to a decoding block of deep neural networksη sðÞ providing aﬁnal\noutput as the probability of landslide occurrencepsðÞ . Therefore, theﬁnal\nmodel MsðÞ looks like pðsÞ¼ MsðÞ ¼ ηðτðXD s; tðÞ Þ L δðXs sðÞ¼\nxsÞÞjXs sðÞ¼ xs; XD s; tðÞ ¼ xD s; tðÞ : The parameters in all functionsτðs; tÞ;\nδðsÞ; ηðsÞ (therefore, MðsÞ) is then estimated through backpropagation\nusing a binary cross entropy loss function 62 ι ¼/C0 LsðÞ log psðÞ\n/C0/C1\nþ\n/C0\n1 /C0 LsðÞðÞ log 1 /C0 psðÞ\n/C0/C1\nÞ. Where, L(s) is the observed landslide over space\nand psðÞ is the predicted landslide probability over space.\nThe function τ s;tðÞ consists of three input waveform parameters\nrepresented in east– west (E– W), north-south (N– S) and up– down (U– D)\ndirections and has a depth of two transformer blocks. Each transformer\nblock consists of a set of sequential layers where inputX\nD s; tðÞ goes through\nlayer normalization and multi-head attention followed by a dropout layer\ncreating vectorv1\ns;tðÞ .T h ev e c t o rv1 s;tðÞ is then added withXD s; tðÞ to\ninclude the attention mechanism and is normalized through a normal-\nization layer creating the vectorv2\ns;tðÞ .S u b s e q u e n t l y ,v2 s;tðÞ ﬂows through a\nfeed-forward block of convolution, rectiﬁed linear unit, dropout, convolu-\ntion, and rectiﬁed linear unit. Finally adding the attention layer from the\nprevious part (v3 s;tðÞ ¼ v1 s;tðÞ þ v2 s;tðÞ ) to create an output of transformer\nencoder making a new inputXD s; tðÞ nþ1, for the next block. This is repeated\nmany times as the number of transformer blocks, and after that, the output\nvector v3 s;tðÞ is passed through the global average pooling layer, creating\nfeature spacef 1s. The global average pooling layer therefore squeezes the\ntemporal information into spatial only information allowing us to combine\nthe dynamic variables with static variables.\nThe part of δ\nsðÞ Xs sðÞ¼ xs\n/C0/C1\nprocesses the input static dataXs sðÞ\nsequentially through dense blocks consisting of a series of fully connected,\nbatch normalization, dropout, and rectiﬁed linear activation units. In this\nmodel, we have eight blocks to process the inputX\ns sðÞ to obtainf 2s.W i t h\nboth f 1s; f 2s available, we further process through a series of blocks con-\nsisting of a fully connected network, rectiﬁed linear units, and dropout\nlayers. Finally passing it through the sigmoid activation function to generate\npseudo-probabilities in terms ofpðsÞ.\nWe trained the model with Adam optimizer63 and the binary cross\nentropy loss function. The optimizer started with a learning rate of 1e−3a n d\nexponentially decayed every 10,000 steps by a factor of 0.95 until the model\nconverged (for further details, see parameters in the provided code). The\ntraining data was generated by randomly selecting 70% of the receiver\nlocations, and the remaining 30% were kept as the test set. Moreover, the\ntraining data was further divided into the subset of 20% for the validation set\nduring the model training process to evaluate the model and stop the\ntraining before overﬁtting. This data selection is kept constant for the\nentirety of the research, making it consistent over benchmarks.\nSince our developed model consisted of a deep neural network and\ntransformer components, we designed it in such a way that bothτ\ns;tðÞ and\nδ sðÞ components can be turned off. Multiple benchmark models were cre-\nated by turning each component off and on with different input variables,\nwhile keeping the output variables and ground truth (pðsÞ and LðsÞ)t h e\nsame. Table2 lists the models, their respective components, and used input\nvariables.\nEvaluation framework\nWe evaluated the classiﬁcation capacity of the model by computing multiple\nevaluation metrics common to statistics and machine learning39,64.T o\nevaluate the model performance, we used the area under the curve (AUC) of\nthe receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC), which is a well-accepted\nmethod to evaluate the model performance andﬁt\n65.T h eR O Cc u r v ei s\ngenerated by evaluating theﬁt betweenLðsÞ and pðsÞ by using a confusion\nmatrix for different probability threshold values in the range of [0,1].

Once the ROC\ncurve is identiﬁed, the AUC is calculated as AUC¼\nR\n1\n0TPR /C1 d FPRðÞ .\nTo evaluate the model performance on the validation set, we used\ndifferent scoring methods designed for the classi ﬁcation problem:\nAccuracy score (ACC), F1 score, and intersection over union (IOU)\nscore. The accuracy score is a ratio between the total number of correct\npredictions and the total number of samples. The F1 score is more\nrobust than the accuracy score and is sensitive to false positives as well\nas false negatives. It is calculated as twice the ratio of the product of\nprecision and recall over the summ ation of precision and recall\n(F1 ¼ 2 /C1\nprecision /C1 recall\nprecision þrecall). Precision and recall are the ratios of correctly\npredicted positive observations to the total predicted positives and the\nratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total actual\npositives, respectively. IOU score, on the other hand, represents the\noverlap between the observed and predicted landslides and A higher\nIOU indicates better alignment between the predicted and ground\ntruth. It is calculated as a ratio of true positives over the union of all\ninstances predicted as positive (both true and false positives) and all\ninstances that are actually positi ve (both true positives and false\nnegatives).\nExplainability\nTo understand how the waveform component in our input dataXD s; tðÞ\ninﬂuences the model output p sðÞ , we implemented an explainable\napproach. The explainable artiﬁcial intelligence based evaluation in\nlandslide hazard modeling is recent yet meaningful approach to under-\nstand the inﬂuence of input covariates on model output\n66. The method is\nbased on the work of Cisneros et al.67 and Shrikumar et al.53, where we\ncalculate the inﬂuence scoresS based on the gradient of p(s) with respect\nto input vectorXD s; tðÞ where it is set to zeros (XD0 s; tðÞ ) for baseline\ngradient ∇b ¼\n∂Ms XD0 s;tðÞ ;XS sðÞðÞ\n∂XD0 s;tðÞ ; and actual values for instance gradient\n∇i ¼\n∂Ms XDi s;tðÞ ;XS sðÞðÞ\n∂XDi s;tðÞ . This gradient can be assumed as the regression\ncoefﬁcient (m) in the case of linear regression problemy ¼ mx þ c. Since\nour model is highly non-linear, a direct comparison ofm cannot be\nmade; thus, we compare their relative change to understand how the\nvariable t inﬂuences the model output. For that, we take a relative ratio of\nthe gradients, also considering the actual change in values as below:\nS ¼ X\nDi s; tðÞ /C0 XD0 s; tðÞ\n/C0/C1\n/C1 ∇i\n∇i /C0 ∇0\nNotably, the score (S) here is calculated only for the waveform com-\nponent and not for the constant variables because the inﬂuence of other\ncovariates on landslide occurrence isw e l l - k n o w n ,a n do u rf o c u si so n\nunderstanding the role of ground motion waveform on landslide\noccurrences.\nData availability\nAll the pre-processed and raw datasets required to reproduce the results\nand the model outputﬁles are available via the open-access repository\n(stored in separate folders for relevant input and outputﬁles), which can\nbe accessed viahttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10514311.
