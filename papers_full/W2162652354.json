    "abstract": "Power transformers are widely used as step-up or step-down devices and they can offer galvanic isolation between the input of the power supply and the output. When the operating frequency is considerably high, transformer parasitics are of importance. Interleaving of the transformer windings causes a reduction of the leakage inductance. However, the winding capacitance and the stray capacitance increases due",
