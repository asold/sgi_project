However, FMA is primarily in English. In this context, the translation of FMA English terms into French\ncould also be useful for searching and indexing French anatomy resources. Various studies have investigated\nautomatic methods to assist the translation of medical terminologies or create multilingual medical vocabularies.\nThe goal of this study was to facilitate the translation of FMA vocabulary into French.\nMethods: We compare two types of approaches to translate the FMA terms into French. The first one is UMLS-\nbased on the conceptual information of the UMLS metathesaurus. The second method is lexically-based on several\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tools.\nResults: The UMLS-based approach produced a translation of 3,661 FMA terms into French whereas the lexical\napproach produced a translation of 3,129 FMA terms into French. A qualitative evaluation was made on 100 FMA\nterms translated by each method. For the UMLS-based approach, among the 100 translations, 52% were manually\nrated as “very good” and only 7% translations as“bad”. For the lexical approach, among the 100 translations, 47%\nwere rated as“very good” and 20% translations as“bad”.\nConclusions: Overall, a low rate of translations were demonstrated by the two methods. The two approaches\npermitted us to semi-automatically translate 3,776 FMA terms from English into French, this was to added to the\nexisting 10,844 French FMA terms in the HMTP (4,436 FMA French terms and 6,408 FMA terms manually\ntranslated).\nIntroduction\nBiomedical terminologies and ontologies have prolifer-\nated during the past decade. Due to this proliferation,\nhealth care systems use different biomedical terminolo-\ngies. Anatomical knowledge is central to biomedical\napplications, including automated coding of Electronic\nHealth Records, free-text indexing and information\nretrieval. Various representations of anatomy have been\ndeveloped (e.g. Adult Mouse Anatomical Dictionary, the\nFoundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), ... etc), but\ntheir coverage varies according to the language. The\nFrench language, while being fairly well represented in\nseveral medical terminolog ies and controlled vocabul-\naries (such as MeSH, SNOMED International and ICD-\n10) could still benefit from the addition of new terms\nbased on vocabularies assoc iated to the lexicon of the\nFMA ontology or the SNOMED CT.\nThe catalogue of online health resources in French\n(CISMeF) [1] is an example of an application which is\nbased on French-language medical terminology\nresources. CISMeF was originally indexed on the basis\nof only one medical thesaurus: the Medical Subject\nHeadings (MeSH). Since 2005, we have decided to use\nthe main health terminologies available in French for\nautomatic indexing and information retrieval [2]. In this\ncontext, the addition of new French terminologies\n* Correspondence: tayeb.merabti@chu-rouen.fr\n1CISMeF, Rouen University Hospital, Normandy & TIBS, LITIS EA 4108, Institute\nof Biomedical Research, Rouen, France\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nMerabti et al.

The FMA vocabulary is a good exam-\nple of this type of terminology not translated (in its full\nversion) into French. The French translation of FMA\nterms available in English will be useful to index and to\nsearch anatomical resources through the CISMeF.\nIn this study, we propose two approaches to automati-\ncally translate the FMA from English into French: a\nknowledge-based approach that mainly relies on the\nUnified Medical Language System resources (UMLS\n®)\n[3], and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach\nusing the Multi-Terminolgical CISMeF Information Sys-\ntem (CISMeF_IS) [2] that contains 27 terminologies (see\nTable 1). The main objective of this paper aims at\ncomparing the two approaches (UMLS-based and lexi-\ncal) to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each\napproach.\nBackground\nVarious studies have investigated automatic methods\nto assist the translation of medical terminologies or to\ncreate multilingual medical vocabularies. Some of these\nmethods use rewriting rules to translate biomedical\nterms: in [4] the authors proposed a method to trans-\nlate biomedical terms from Portuguese into Spanish.\nThis method is also applied for information retrieval\n[5]. However, as stated in [6], rules used are hand-\ncoded, which renders this approach not transferable to\nother languages and domains. The method proposed in\n[6] relies on an automatic process able to infer rewrit-\ning rules from examples. These examples represent a\nlist of paired terms in two studied languages (pair\nterms from Masson medical dictionary and from the\nUMLS metathesaurus). In [6] the author has presented\nan automatic method that relies on machine learning\ntechnique. It can infer transducers from examples of\nbilingual word pairs without any additional resource or\nknowledge. In contrast, some methods use existing ter-\nminological resources to translate medical terminolo-\ngies: in our previous work [7] we proposed a\nsemantics-based method to assist the translation of\nSNOMED CT into French. We also used the UMLS\nMetathesaurus restricted to four French terminologies.\nRecently, we combined a UMLS-based approach and a\ncorpus-based approach to translate MEDLINEPlus\n®\nTopics from English into French [8]. This UMLS-based\napproach was used in BabelMeSH [9] to automatically\ntranslate a query from French, Spanish and Portuguese\ninto English to allow querying MEDLINE\n® via\nPubMed® with such languages.\nIn order to create a multilingual dictionary, the\nauthors in [10] mapped monolingual medical lexicons\nusing morphological decomposition. In [11], the authors\nproposed a method that uses various parallel terminolo-\ngies to build an English-Swedish medical dictionary.\nOther types of methods are based on text corpora to\nacquire translations of medical terms [12-16]. These\nmultilingual text corpora can be parallel: i.e. texts in dif-\nferent languages that are translations of each other such\nas those used to match English UMLS terms with their\nGerman translations [12] or to find French translations\nof MeSH terms [13]. The multilingual text corpora can\nbe comparable: i.e. texts addressing the same general\ntopic in different languages, to search for French trans-\nlations of medical terms [14], to extend the German ver-\nsion of the MeSH [15] or to build a Japanese-French\nterminology [16].

It\nintegrates over two million concepts (2,200,159 in the\n2010AB version) from 154 biomedical vocabularies. The\nUMLS is made up of three main knowledge compo-\nnents, but, for our purpose, we retained the Metathe-\nsaurus. It is a very large, multi-purpose, and\nmultilingual vocabulary database that contains informa-\ntion about biomedical and health-related concepts, their\nvarious names, and the relationships between them. It is\nbuilt from the electronic versions of many different the-\nsauri, classifications, code sets, and lists of controlled\nterms used in patient care, health services billing, public\nhealth statistics, biomedical literature indexing and cata-\nloging, and health servi ces research. Within the\nMetathesaurus we will use more specifically the\nMRCONSO table, which lists all the concepts that are\nincorporated in the UMLS. Each concept has a Concept\nUnique Identifier (CUI) in this table. This means that\nthe same concept that may appear in various terminolo-\ngies, perhaps with various names and synonyms, has a\nunique entry in the Metathesaurus. Thus, the concept\nidentifier allows to link together the different terminolo-\ngies included in the UMLS.\nAccording to the 154 biomedical vocabularies in the\nUMLS, there are only six French terminologies included:\nthe MeSH\n® thesaurus [18], the International Classifica-\ntion of Diseases (ICD10) [19], the Systematized NOmen-\nclature of MEDicine (SNOMED Int.) [20], the World\nHealth Organization Adverse Reaction Terminology\n(WHO-ART) [21], the WHO International Classification\nof Primary Care(ICPC2) [22] and the Medical Dictionary\nof Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) [23]. Nevertheless,\nonly four (4) terminologies are included with their\nFrench version in UMLS Metathesaurus (MeSH, WHO-\nART, WHO-ICPC2 and MedDRA). However, several\ntranslations had already been added, such as MEDLINE-\nPlus [8] and partially the Logical Observation Identifiers\nNames and Codes (LOINC).\nCISMeF Information System (CISMeF_IS) & Health Multi\nTerminology Portal (HMTP)\nA generic model was designed for the CISMeF_IS in\norder to fit all the terminologies into one global struc-\nture. This model was established around the “Descrip-\ntor” which is the central concept of the terminologies\n(aka “keyword ”). The HMTP is a“Terminological Por-\ntal” connected to the CISMeF_IS to search terms among\nall the health terminologie s available in French (or in\nEnglish and translated into French) included in the CIS-\nMeF_IS and to search it dynamically. The ultimate goal\nis to use this search via the HMTP in order to:\n index manually or automatically resources in the\nCISMeF quality-controlled health gateway;\n allow a multi-terminology information retrieval [2];\nIt can also be very useful for teaching or performing\naudits in terminology management. Currently, the CIS-\nMeF_IS include 27 terminologies and classification, and\ntherefore are user-accessible via the HMTP. Some ter-\nminologies and classifications are included in the UMLS\nmeta-thesaurus (n = 9) but the majority are not (n =\n18) such as ORPHANET [24], DRC [25], IUPAC [26].\nTable 1 lists all the terminologies that are included in\nCISMeF_IS.\nThe Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA)\nThe FMA is an evolving formal ontology that has been\nunder development at the University of Washington\nsince 1994 [27,28]. It is the most complete ontology of\nhuman “canonical” anatomy. The FMA describes anato-\nmical entities, most of which are anatomical structures\ncomposed of many interconnected parts in a complex\nway. Its objective is to conceptualize the physical objects\nand spaces that constitute the human body. It contains\nmore than 81,000 classes and 139 relationships connect-\ning the classes, and over 120,000 terms (preferred and\nsynonyms) with 81,020 unique English preferred terms\n(PT)(Each FMA concept is represented by one preferred\nterm and a list of synonyms), 52,040 unique English\nsynonyms, 4,436 unique French terms and 139 French\nsynonyms. An OWL-2 version of the FMA was recently\nproposed [29].\nFrench terminologies in anatomy\nThere are two standards for French anatomical terms\n[30]:\n an older one, Nomina Anatomica (NA) [31] pub-\nlished by the International Federation of Associa-\ntions of anatomy in 1955;\n a more recent one which is the translation of the\nTerminologica Anatomica (TA) [30].\nExisting FMA\nOut of 4,436 French PT included in the FMA, 1,110 of\nthem were manually reviewed by a French anatomist\n(JM). This expert has proposed to modify the French\nlabel in 104 cases (9.5%) including two (2) mistakes.\nThese modifications were mainly due to the fact that\nold NA was used instead of the TA. In these cases, the\nMerabti et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making2011, 11:65\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/11/65\nPage 3 of 10\nTA was chosen as the terminology for the PT instead of\nthe NA, e.g . for the translation of the English term\n“ulna”, the preferred term may come from TA as“ulna”,\nand the synonym from NA as “cubitus ”.A d d i n gt h e s e\nsynonyms allows other health professionals to refer to\nthe PT “ulna ” when entering “cubitus ” in the HMTP.\nThe FMA was integrated into the HMTP since one year\nand is already available with a restricted access(http://\npts.chu-rouen.fr/index.html?lang=en (click on “Connec-\ntion\"; login=fmauser and password=fmapass)). Since the\ni n t e g r a t i o no ft h eF M Ai n t ot h eH M T P ,6 , 4 0 8t e r m s\nwere manually translated into French (plus the original\n4,436 French translations; +140%). The FMA was inte-\ngrated into the UMLS in 2008 [32]. In UMLS the FMA\nis known as the University of Washington Digital Ana-\ntomist (UWDA) vocabulary. The UWDA consists of the\nAnatomy taxonomy (At) and selected structural rela-\ntionships (part-of, branch-of, tributary of) [33].\nMethods\nWe compared two types of approaches to translate the\nFMA terms into French. The first one is UMLS-based\non the conceptual information of the UMLS Metathe-\nsaurus. The second method is lexically-based on several\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tools.\nUMLS-based Approach\nThe first method relies on the UMLS Metathesaurus. It\nimplies that each term to be translated must be included\nin the Metathesaurus. We use the six French terminolo-\ngies included in the UMLS: the MeSH thesaurus, the\nSNOMED International (SNMI), the MedDRA, the\nICD10, the WHO-ICPC2 and the WHO-ART. The\nFrench version of SNMI is not integrated into the\nUMLS Metathesaurus. However, its terms are tagged\nwith UMLS CUIs, which permits integrating them into\nthe Metathesaurus. The number of preferred terms from\neach terminology in the UMLS are reported in Table 2.\nThe principle of the method is based on the conceptual\nconstruction of the UMLS Metathesaurus. For each\nFMA term in English included in the UMLS, we have\nextracted all UMLS concepts it belongs to. The next\nstage consists of deriving the set of all French terms\nthat are related to the given concept, for each UMLS\nconcept extracted in the first stage, i.e. all French terms\nthat have the same CUI. For example, the FMA code\n“9620”, which corresponds to the English term“Muscle\nof abdomen ”, is related to the UMLS concept\n“C0000739” (\"Abdominal Muscles”). Then, in the second\nstage, two French terms may be associated to the Eng-\nlish term “Muscle of abdomen” according to the UMLS\nconcepts “C0000739” (see Figure 1).\nLexical Approach\nIn this approach, FMA terms in English from all bilin-\ngual terminologies (English and French) were normal-\nized and we applied an algorithm to find terms in target\nterminologies which were the most lexically similar.\nWhen a correspondence was found, the translation of\nthe English target term was proposed as one possible\ntranslation of the FMA term. This algorithm was\nexploited in several previously reported studies to map\nexternal French and English terminologies to UMLS and\nHMTP [17,34,35]. In this method, we used some Nat-\nural Language Processing tools developed by the NLM\n®\n[36]. They were designed to help users in analyzing and\nindexing natural language texts in the medical field in\nEnglish [37,38].\nWe basically used the normalization program\n(\"Norm”) [39]: a program used to normalize English ter-\nminologies (UMLS terminology). The Normalization\nprocess involves stripping genitive marks, transforming\nplural forms into singular, replacing punctuation,\nremoving stop words, lower-casing each word, breaking\na string into its constituent words, and sorting the\nw o r d si n t oa l p h a b e t i co r d e r .I nF i g u r e2o n ec a nf i n da\nlist of all stages to normalize the FMA term“Hodgkin’s\ngranuloma of intra-abdominal lymph nodes”. Mapping\nused by this approach may provide three types of corre-\nspondences between all terms:\n Exact correspondence: if all the words that com-\npose the two terms are exactly the same.\n Single to multiple correspondence: when the\nsource term cannot be mapped by one exact target\nterm, but can be expressed by a combination of two\nor more terms.\n Partial correspondence: in this type of mapping\nonly a part of the source term will be mapped to\none or more target terms.\nIn Table 3 one can find some examples of these three\ntypes of correspondences. In this work, only the exact\nand the single to multiple correspondences were stu-\ndied. For example, based on this approach, the FMA\nterm “Thymic branches of internal thoracic artery ” is\nTable 2 Number of Preferred terms from each\nterminologies in UMLS\nTerminologies Number of Preferred terms in UMLS\nSNMI 107,900\nMeSH 25,587\nMedDRA 18,483\nICD10 9,308\nWHO-ART 1,560\nICPS2 423\nMerabti et al.

Finally,\nthe corresponding French SNOMED International term\n“Rameaux thymiques de l’artère thoracique interne” was\nsubsequently proposed as a possible translation of the\nEnglish FMA term “Thymic branches of internal thor-\nacic artery”.\nEvaluation\nQuantitative Evaluation\nWe investigated the coverage of the two methods accord-\ning to the number of FMA PT translated into French. We\nalso examined the coverage of the translated FMA terms\nby considering the French terminologies and the terms\nfrom these terminologies in the UMLS Metathesaurus and\nin CISMeF_IS for the lexically-based approach. We also\ncompared the two approaches (lexical approach limited to\nthe exact correspondence), by examining the number of\ndifferent FMA PT translated by each approach. For each\napproach, we calculated the number of the English PT\nwith at least one French translation (from the whole FMA,\nN = 81,020) and we calculated only the number of transla-\ntions performed from FMA PT without French terms.\nQualitative Evaluation\nThe qualitative evaluation was performed on 100 trans-\nlations from each approach by an expert on anatomy\n(OP). The samples of 100 FMA terms were randomly\nchosen. The expert was blinded to the two methods.\nThis evaluation is clearly subjective using a six-levels\nscale for rating th eir quality: (a) “Very Good\": the\nFrench translation corresponds exactly to the English\nFMA term; (b) “Good\": the French translation is very\ngood with no impact to the meaning but there are some\nminor differences such as missing punctuations like“-”.\nFor example, the translation of the FMA term“plantar\ntarsometatarsal ligaments ” to the French term “liga-\nments tarsométatarsiens plantaires” was rated as“Good”\nbecause the anatomist considered that the French term\nis missing a “-” between “tarso” and “métatarsiens\"; (c)\n“Average\": the French translation will be more accurate\nif we delete or add some terms or when a singular term\n(resp. plural) is translated to plural (resp. singular); (d)\n“Bad\": the French translation is false, but the corre-\nsponding term shares some true terms or the translation\ncorresponds to a part of the original term. For example,\nthe translation of the FMA term“tunica intima” to the\nFrench term “tunica intima” was rated as“Bad” because\nFigure 2Example of Normalization process for the FMA term“Hodgkin’s granuloma of intra-abdominal lymph nodes”.\nFigure 1translation of the FMA term“Muscle of abdomen” using the UMLS-Based approach.\nMerabti et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making2011, 11:65\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/11/65\nPage 5 of 10\nthe term is“intima\"; (e) “Very Bad\": the French transla-\ntion is false; (f)“cannot say\": when the anatomist cannot\nevaluate the translation, when he does not know the\nFMA term for example. Examples of each evaluation are\nlisted in Table 4.\nResults\nUMLS-based Approach\nUsing the UMLS-based approach, a set of 7,469 (9%)\nFMA PT were translated to at least one French term\nand 3,661 (49% of the 7,469) of them only exists in Eng-\nlish in the FMA. Table 5 lists the number of French\nterms from each terminology proposed as a possible\ntranslation.\nFor example, the FMA term “Abdomen ” was trans-\nlated to three possible French terms: “abdomen, sai ”,\n“abdomen” and “ventre”.\nLexical Approach\nAccording to the exact type of mapping, 6,246 (7,7%)\nFMA PT were translated to at least one French term\nand 3,129 (50% of the 6,246) of them exist in English in\nthe FMA. Table 6 lists the number of French terms\nfrom each terminology proposed as a possible\ntranslation.\nAccording to the“single to multiple” type of mapping,\n27,761 FMA PT were translated to at least a combina-\ntion of two French terms. However, these translations\nare not exact and need to be adjusted manually to con-\nstruct the exact French term from the proposed one.\nFor example, the FMA term “left third costotransverse\nforamen” was mapped to the three French terms:“trou\nde conjugaison postérieur de cruveilhier ” (costotrans-\nverse foramen), “gauche\"(left) and “troisième ” (third).\nU s i n gt h e s et h r e eF r e n c ht e r m san e wt e r mw a sc o n -\nstructed manually: “t r o i s i è m et r o ud ec o n j u g a i s o n\npostérieur gauche de cruveilhier”, and was proposed as a\npossible translation of “left third costotransverse\nforamen”.\nFor the two approaches, more than one French term\nwas proposed. However, only one term was manually\nchosen to be the unique translation of the English FMA\nterm, the rest of terms were added as UMLS synonyms\nto the FMA term (or French synonyms in the case of\nthe lexical approach if terms correspond to the valid\nmapping terms but not to the valid translation of the\nFMA PT). For example, for the FMA term“abdomen”\nthe French term “abdomen ” was chosen to be the\nFrench translation, whereas, the two terms “abdomen,\nsai” and “ventre ” were added as UMLS synonyms (or\nFrench synonyms)(see Figure 3).\nComparing the two approaches (UMLS-based Approach\nvs. Exact lexical approach)\nQuantitative Comparison\nUsing the UMLS-based approach 3,661 English FMA PT\nwere translated when 3,129 FMA terms were translated\nby the exact lexical-based approach. From the FMA PT\nterms translated by the UMLS-based method, 647 terms\nare not in the set of those translated by the exact lexical\nmethods and inversely, 115 FMA PT translated by the\nexact lexical method are not in the set of those trans-\nl a t e db yt h et h eU M L S - b a s e dm e t h o d( s e eF i g u r e4 ) .\nWhen comparing Tables 5 and 6, only five terminolo-\ngies were used by both methodologies: SNOMED Inter-\nnational and MeSH provided more mapping by the\nUMLS-based approach than the lexical based approach\nrespectively (6,472 vs. 1,419 and 5,287 vs.1 , 3 4 0 ) ,\nwhereas ICD10 provided more mapping for the lexical\napproach (170 vs. 5). WHO-ART and MedDRA pro-\nvided very few mappings with both approaches (see\nTable 5 and Table 6).\nTable 4 Examples of each type of evaluation used in this study\nEnglish French Evaluation\nThymic branches of internal thoracic artery Rameaux thymiques de l’artère thoracique interne Very Good\nPlantar tarsometatarsal ligaments Ligaments tarsométatersiens plantaires Good\nInterosseous metacarpal ligament Ligaments métacarpiens interosseux Average\nMetatrsal interosseous ligaments Ligaments intermétatarsiens interosseux Bad\nBlood capillary Sang capillaire Very Bad\nCell membrane protein Protéines membranaires CNS\nTable 3 Examples of the three types of mappings using lexical approach\nType of correspondence FMA term French Term(s) (English term)\nExact Hand muscle Muscle de la main (Muscles of hand)\nSingle to Multiple Left dorsal scapular artery Artère scapulaire postérieure (Dorsal scapular artery) and (+) Gauche (Left)\nPartial Abdominal extraperitoneal fascia Fascia de l ’abdomen (Fascia of abdomen, nos)\nMerabti et al.

For the lexical approach, 47 translations of the\n100 submitted an expert were rated as“very good” and\n20 were rated as “bad ” or “very bad ” (see Table 7).\nThere is a significant difference between the two\napproaches (X2 test, p = 0.015).\nThere are two types of errors using the two\napproaches: (a) partial errors: only a part of the French\nterm was correct but not entierly; (b) complete errors:\nall the words that compose the French term were false.\nIn several cases, the expert proposed the right transla-\ntion whereas the French term proposed was false (see\nTable 8).\nDiscussion\nThe aim of this study was to compare two approaches\nto translate a part of FMA vocabulary from English to\nFrench. The overall translation yield is quite low. Never-\ntheless, it has saved long hours for translators. The\nUMLS-based approach is straightforward and easy to\nimplement. This approach has the advantage of domain\nknowledge included in the UMLS. In spite of the small\nnumber of French terminologies used from UMLS, the\nUMLS-based approach allows to acquire good quality\nFigure 3FMA term “Abdomen” translated to three French terms: one chosen and two added as French synonyms.\nTable 6 Number of Terms from each terminology\nmapped to at least one term from FMA using the Lexical\nBased approach\nTerminology Number of terms\nSNOMED International 5,287\nMeSH 1,340\nICD10 170\nWHO-ICF 79\nATC 61\nIUPAC 56\nMedDRA 45\nORPHANET 31\nMEDLINEPlus 24\nWHO-ART 3\nTable 5 Number of Terms from each terminology\nmapped to at least one term from FMA using the\nKnowledge Based approach\nTerminology Number of terms\nSNOMED International 6,472\nMeSH 1,419\nMedDRA 9\nWHO-ART 6\nICD10 5\nMerabti et al.

Qualitative evaluation demonstrated that\n69% of the translations were rated as “very good ” or\n“good”.\nOn the other hand, the lexical approach is more diffi-\ncult to implement but has the advantage of the large\nnumber of French medical terminologies included in\nCISMeF_IS. Qualitative eva luation demonstrate that\n59% of the translations were rated as “very good ” or\n“good”. However, there are more translations rated as\n“bad ” or “very bad ” compared to the UMLS-based\napproach. The major types of translations rated as“bad”\nor “very bad” can be explained by three major reasons:\n translation from the singular to plural or vice\nversa. For example, the French translation“ligaments\ndorsaux du tarse” corresponds to the plural term of\nthe exact French translation of the English FMA\nterm: “dorsal tarsal ligament”.\n the French translation is very specific or very broad\ncompared to the FMA English term. For example,\nthe French translation“deuxième facette métatarsien\ndu premier cunéiforme” is broader than the English\nFMA term “second metatarsal facet of medial\ncuneiform bone ”. In this case, the expert proposed\nthe exact French translation“deuxième facette méta-\ntarsiene du l’os cunéiforme médial”.\n the French translation in the original terminology\nis not good. For example, the French translation\n“ligaments intermétatarsiens interosseux ” of the\nFMA English term “metatarsal interosseous liga-\nments ” is rated as false, however, this translation\nalready exists between the two SNOMED Int. Eng-\nlish and French terms. In this case, the expert pro-\nposed the French translation“ligaments métatarsiens\ninterosseux” adapted to the FMA English term.\nUsing the two approaches, mapping between terms of\ndifferent languages might vary in coverage depending on\nthe terminology to be translated and on the target lan-\nguage. In our previously reported study [8] we translated\na large number of MEDLINEPlus vocabulary in French\ndue to the small number of terms. However, the small\nnumber of FMA terms automatically translated was not\nonly due to the large number of terms but also to the\nlimited anatomical coverage in all the terminologies\nused (e.g .I C D 1 0 ,M e d D R A ,W H O - A R T ,. . .e t c . ) .T h e\nsignificant differences of mapping size by three ter-\nminologies (SNOMED International, MeSH, ICD10)\nused by the methods could be explained by the fact that\nICD10 terms are based on the old NA where MeSH\nterms are based on the new TA and SNOMED Interna-\ntional includes both of them. Although the use of lexical\nmethods in the second produces high-quality alignments\n[40-43], the validity of the resulting lexical mappings is\nTable 7 Evaluation of 100 translations produced by the\ntwo approaches\nVery\ngood\nGood Average Bad Very\nbad\nNSP\nUMLS-based\napproach\n52 17 22 6 1 2\nLexical approach 47 10 15 13 7 8\nFigure 4The repartition of the number of FMA English terms translated by lexically and UMLS-based approaches.\nMerabti et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making2011, 11:65\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/11/65\nPage 8 of 10\nnot guaranteed [44]. For example, in [45] the results of\napplying lexical mapping alone (using Metamap) with\n70% coverage, 28.4% recall, 14.7% precision and almost\n3 mappings per term. Therefore, the precision and recall\nwas too low, and the ambiguity (3 mappings per term)\nhigh. Currently, structure-b ased techniques, which use\nstructural properties like shared relationships across\nsources to find alignments between concepts, are\napplied in combination with lexical techniques, as it has\nbeen demonstrated that it increases the overall perfor-\nmance [42-44,46,47].\nIn contrast, the use of some approaches such as a cor-\npus-based approach [12-16] or a statistical-based\napproach can offer more adapted and accurate transla-\ntions. However, these approaches are limited in term of\nsuch parallel corpora and in term of low quantity of\nacquired translations. Nevertheless, a word by word\ntranslation [6] of terms may be a possible complemen-\ntary approach.\nEach approach can be improved: UMLS-based\napproach could benefit from additional French terminol-\nogies added to the UMLS Metathesaurus or more inte-\ngrated terminologies translated in French. Due to this\nproblem we proposed multiple approaches to map sev-\neral French terminologies not integrated in the UMLS\nto the UMLS such as the Classification Commune des\nActes Médicaux (CCAM)\"A French coding system of\nsurgical procedures” [17] and the ORPHANET database\nof rare diseases [35]. For the lexical approach, several\nimprovements can be proposed to resolve problems due\nto the management of ambiguous acronyms across ter-\nminologies (e.g. CMT in MeSH (\"Thyroid neoplasms” or\n“Charcot-marie-tooth disease ”)), or for the terms lexi-\ncally close but with a different meaning, such as sterile\nas a “aspetic technique ” and sterility as “Infertility ”.\nThese two problems can be solved by using the UMLS\nsemantic groups (SGs) [48] when the two terms are in\nthe UMLS. Thus, mappings between two terms that do\nn o ts h a r et h es a m eS G sw o u l db ef i l t e r e do u t .A n o t h e r\nadvantage of using the UMLS SGs is that it is easy to\ndetect possible errors of translations between English\nterms and French terms from UMLS.\nIt has a real impact for a daily use of the FMA that\ncould play a central role in French education and\nresources indexing. Since the main thesaurus such as\nMeSH lack precise anatomical terms, the FMA integra-\ntion and translation in the CISMeF_IS is a great oppor-\ntunity to improve the level of indexing to allow users\nquerying very precise terms and subsequently to find\nrelevant resources. The F MA translation will also\nimprove the French translation of SNOMED CT and\nNational Institute Common Terminology.\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we present a methodology to translate the\nlexicon of the FMA ontology into French. We compare\ntwo approaches, a UMLS-based approach and a lexical\napproach. Overall, a low rate of translations were\ndemonstrated by the two methods. Nevertheless, the\ntwo approaches permitted us to semi-automatically\ntranslate 3,776 FMA terms from English into French,\nthis was to added to the existing 10,844 French FMA\nterms in the HMTP (4,436 FMA French terms and\n6,408 FMA terms manually translated).\nAcknowledgements and Funding\nThis work was partially granted by the PlaIR project(http://www.plair.org),\nfunded by ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) and based on\nprevious French Nation Research Agency projects (InterSTIS, ALADIN, L3IM).\nThe authors thank Christine Golbreich for her contribution in the integrating\nFMA into the HMTP.
