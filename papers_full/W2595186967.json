    "abstract": "This paper proposes a dc/dc converter for electric vehicle onboard chargers using a secondary resonant tank. To attain soft switching characteristics, such as zero voltage switching, magnetizing inductance has been used at the primary side of the transformer. The leakage inductance of the transformer is used as a resonant inductor on the secondary side to avoid the use of a separate inductor as resonance. The proposed converter is applicable for a wide load range. A 6.6KW prototype has been implemented for a wide range of load variations (250V, 330V, 360V, and 413V). A maximum efficiency of 97.4% is achieved at 413V.",
