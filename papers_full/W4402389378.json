More and more\npeople are now turning to LLMs to acquire the desired information on\ndiverse topics. Despite their advanced capabilities, the interactions with\nLLMs has been criticized for their insufficient factual accuracy [19,56],\n• ∗ equal contribution, ‡ co-corresponding authors\n• Youfu Yan, and Qianwen Wang are with the Department of Computer\nScience and Engineering, University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN, USA.\nE-mail: yan00111, qianwen@umn.edu\n• Yu Hou, Yongkang Xiao, Rui Zhang are with the Medical School, University\nof Minnesota, Twin Cities, MN, USA.

These issues are\nparticularly critical when seeking health-related information, where\naccuracy and clarity are paramount.\nOne primary reason for these issues is that LLMs encode knowledge\nfrom the training corpus in the form of model parameters, which are\ndifficult to interpret, validate, and align with users’ cognitive processes.\nAs a result, one promising solution is to enhance LLMs with external\nknowledge that can be inspected and interpreted [26, 34]. Among vari-\nous formats of external knowledge, knowledge graphs (KG) are attract-\ning increasing attention due to their decisive knowledge representation\nand symbolic reasoning ability. A knowledge graph stores structured\nknowledge as a network of entities and their relations, serving a broad\nrange of domain applications including drug development [16, 42],\nchildren education [7, 23], and pedigree networks [33]. Incorporating\nknowledge graphs in LLMs can provide structured knowledge when\ntraining the model [1], retrieve pertinent information when respond-\ning to specific queries [26], and offer evidence when reasoning the\noutputs [36]. Such integration have been shown to significantly boost\nperformance in domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks [34].\n1\narXiv:2407.13598v1  [cs.HC]  18 Jul 2024\nWhile integrating knowledge graphs can markedly enhance the qual-\nity of LLM outputs, this enhancement is underutilized with current\npurely text-based interfaces. These interfaces, which typically rely on\nlinear text formats like extended paragraphs, limit the user’s ability to\ncollect, organize, and synthesize information from the structured exter-\nnal knowledge, which has the potential to greatly facilitate the user’s\ncognitive process. Recently, a growing body of studies are exploring in-\nnovative interfaces for LLM via text-visualization coordination [17,57],\nmulti-level abstractions [39], node-link diagrams [2]. However, these\nstudies mainly focused on enriching human-LLM interactions through\nprompt engineering, providing little discussion about the integration of\nexternal knowledge bases. Meanwhile, many visual analytics methods\nhave been proposed in the past decades to facilitate the interpreta-\ntion of graphs for both domain-specific ( e.g., biomedical knowledge\ngraphs [27, 42], neural network architectures [18, 47]) and general pur-\nposes [28, 35, 38]. But these visualization techniques mainly support\ninformation seeking through queries about graph structures (e.g., paths\nconnecting nodes A and B, nodes with the highest degree) and cannot\nbe directly applied to complex tasks that require iterative conversations.\nThere is a gap in effectively leveraging external knowledge graphs for\nmore comprehensive and interactive visual interfaces for LLM.\nThis study proposes KNOW NET, a visualization system for health\ninformation retrieval by improving the traditional LLM-based with\nenhanced accuracy and structured exploration via integrating external\nKGs. To enhance accuracy, we extracted triples (e.g., entities and\ntheir relations) from LLM outputs and mapped them into the validated\ninformation and supported evidence in external KGs. For structured ex-\nploration, KNOW NET provides recommendations for further inquiry to\nhelp form a comprehensive understanding without overlooking critical\naspects. Considering a multi-step exploration might introduce informa-\ntion overwhelming, KNOW NET follows the focus+context design and\nproposes a progressive graph visualization to track previous inquiries,\nand connect this history with current queries and next-step recommen-\ndations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system via use cases\nand expert interviews While we probed its capabilities initially within\nthe context of dietary supplements ( e.g., vitamins, minerals, herbs),\nan area where scientifically validated information is partially impor-\ntant given the prevalence of exaggerated claims and misinformation,\nthe proposed approach is applicable to a wide array of applications.\nThe source code and documentations for KNOW NET are available at\nhttps://visual-intelligence-umn.github.io/KNOWNET/.\n2 R ELATED WORK\n2.1 Improving the Usability of LLM\nAs LLMs are increasingly employed, there is growing concern about\ntheir usability limitations stemming from both the inherent character-\nistics of LLMs and the design of current interfaces. Various research\nefforts are being undertaken to mitigate these issues.\nOne approach focuses on offering controllability through tailored\nguidance, especially via prompt designs. Many studies have observed\nthat, without further guidance, users tended to interact with LLMs\nopportunistically and struggle to make robust progress [6,13,55]. A list\nof tools has been proposed to guide the design of prompts for support\nLLM interactions. For instance, AI Chains [51] provides an interactive\nsystem that chains LLM prompts and enables users to modify these\nchains in a modular way. Promptify [6] and PromptMagician [13]\nutilizes a suggestion engine to help users quickly explore, craft, and\norganize diverse prompts. Zamfirescu-Pereira et al. [55] suggested\nstrategies such as the use of example input/output pairs and the use of\nrepetition within prompts. Even though these studies have contributed\nvaluable insights, it remains a challenge to design them effectively\nas there is no one-size-fits-all solution. In a recent study, Su-Fang et\nal. [54] investigated the effects of two guidance types and four guidance\ntimings. Their study indicated there is no clear best choice for guidance\ntype or timing, but depends on the specific goals of the guidance.\nMeanwhile, a parallel research branch explores integrating graphical\nrepresentations to complement traditional text interface. For instance,\nChatGPT has included multiple plug-ins, such as Lucid GPT [29] and\nChatGPT Diagrams [15], that translate textual outputs into visual di-\nagrams. However, these visual outputs are usually static images with\nlimited or no interactivity. To address this issue, Graphologue [17]\nconstructs interactive graphical charts using novel prompt strategies.\nSensecape [39] further enhanced these graphical charts by introducing\nhierarchical abstracts among which users can easily navigate. The\nintegration of graphical representation has also been demonstrated to\nimprove task performance and user satisfaction in various domain ap-\nplications, including argumentative writing [57] and creative coding [2].\nUnlike prior studies that merely converted LLM text outputs to visual\nrepresentations, our study aims to integrate external knowledge graphs\nto enhance the interactions with LLMs.\nIn spite of the great success of the above efforts, they cannot improve\ntask performance in which LLMs have limited knowledge. As a result,\nresearchers proposed harnessing external knowledge to improve the\noutput quality, known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [26].\nRAG can enhance LLMs by querying relevant information from an\nexternal dataset for generating outputs, ensuring that the responses\nare grounded in retrieved evidence and include up-to-date knowledge.\nAmong different types of external knowledge bases, knowledge graphs\nare widely used due to their symbolic reasoning ability, as discussed\nin the survey paper of Pan et al. [34]. For example, Ashby et al. [3]\ngenerated fluent and coherent dialogue for role-playing games by incor-\nporating LLMs with a hand-crafted knowledge graph about the game\nworld. However, these studies mainly use external knowledge graphs\nfor improving LLM outputs and do not explicitly elucidate how the\nintegration can improve human-LLM interfaces, which is the main\nfocus of our paper.\n2.2 Visualizing Graph-based Knowledge\nGraph visualization for knowledge communication has received exten-\nsive attention within the visualization community. A diverse array of\nvisual analytics systems has been developed, covering diverse domains\nsuch as biology networks [27, 42], neural networks [18, 47], and pedi-\ngree networks [33]. The principal challenge lies in effectively uncover-\ning patterns within large graphs. A variety of visualization techniques\nhave been proposed for uncovering different types of patterns, including\nlayout algorithms designed to expose communities within graphs [48],\ntechniques for path querying and organization [35, 42], and methods\nfor conducting visual comparisons across different graphs [47]. For\nexample, Wanget al. [42] proposed a novel design, MetaMatrix, to help\nusers organize and compare explanation paths in a biomedical knowl-\nedge graph at different levels of granularity. In spite of the effectiveness\nof these methods, the challenges in graph exploration often extend be-\nyond merely generating a static visualization but necessitate interaction\ntechniques, leading to a set of popular interaction techniques such as\nfocus + context and semantic zoom. Focus + context techniques, such\nas fish-eye [37], display the object of interest in detail (focus) with an\noverview of surrounding information (context). Semantic zoom [30,49]\nadjusts the visual representations dynamically based on the level of\ndetails. Once patterns are identified, efficiently communicating them\nalso poses another complex challenge, leading to investigations into\nthe use of natural language interfaces and narrative techniques. For\ninstance, GVQA [38] facilitates the articulation of visual insights in\ngraph visualizations through natural language. NetworkNarratives [28]\nintroduces semi-automatic data tours that elucidate network facts via\nslideshows with visualizations and textual annotations.\nOur study is built upon previous studies on graph visualization,\nexamining various visualization techniques for facilitating human-LLM\ninteractions with the integration of external knowledge graphs.\n3 I NFORMING THE DESIGN\nKNOW NET is designed to aid users in searching for health-related\ninformation by seamlessly integrating LLM outputs with external KG. It\ntargets individuals who require access to such information and possess\nthe ability to grasp complex medical concepts and interpret research\nfindings. Primary users of this tool include medical researcher, health\nscience students, and patient advocates.\n2\n© 2024 IEEE. This is the author’s version of the article that has been published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and\nComputer Graphics. The final version of this record is available at: xx.xxxx/TVCG.201x.xxxxxxx/\n3.1 Design Requirements\nWe identify the design challenge based on discussion with domain\nexperts and review of literature, following the practices in [9, 45, 46].\nSpecifically, three authors are experts in computational health sciences\nwith extensive experience, including a professor with 15 years of re-\nsearch in health AI, knowledge graphs, and clinical NLP; a postdoc\nresearcher with 6 years of experience in knowledge graphs and EHR\ndata analysis; and a PhD candidate with 3 years of experience in knowl-\nedge graphs and health informatics.\nFour authors, including two domain and two visualization experts,\nfirst collaboratively built a list of relevant papers that examined, applied,\nor improved LLMs for various information-seeking tasks, including\nbut not limited to writing [22, 57], coding [2, 55], and healthcare [53].\nEach paper was then independently reviewed by at least two authors.\nDrawing on the findings from the literature review, the author team\nheld weekly meetings to refine the design requirements, update the\ndesign, and test the developed tool. Through this iterative process, we\nidentified five key design challenges.\nC.1 Linear Response to Hierarchical Information: LLMs, by de-\nsign, generate responses in a linear fashion, presenting information\nin a single continuous stream. However, the structure of knowl-\nedge itself is intrinsically marked by complex and multifaceted\nrelationships among concepts. Taking a common dietary supple-\nmentary vitamin D as an example. At a basic level, understanding\nvitamin D involves understanding its various forms (e.g., D2, D3),\nsources (e.g., sunlight, food), and its role in the human body, such\nas supporting bone health and immune function. Delving deeper\nreveals a web of interconnected details that spans nutrition, bio-\nchemistry, and public health, such as its involvement in calcium\nabsorption and the implications of its deficiency. As a result, the\ncurrent linear presentation off LLMs can represent users to grasp\nthe complex structure and navigate intricate topics [17, 39, 57].\nC.2 Limited Support for Verification: LLMs often suffer from hal-\nlucination, wherein an LLM generates incorrect information but\npresents it as it was a fact, which can potentially deceive users who\nlack the expertise to assess the information accuracy. This can\nlead to potential deception among users who may not have prior\nknowledge to evaluate the accuracy of the information. Several\nLLM-based chatbots have integrated internet search to alleviate\nthis issue, but the referred online resources have various reliabil-\nity. In a critical context, such as medicine and healthcare, users\nhave expressed a preference for AI tools that function similarly\nto knowledgeable colleagues that can reference reliable evidence,\nsuch as biomedical research, to support their responses [53].\nC.3 Information Overload: LLMs are often designed to generate\na verbose, long-form answers that includes extensive informa-\ntion [25, 26]. Users can be overloaded, feel that “there is too\nmuch to read”, and find it challenging to efficiently interpret the\nresponse and comprehend the underlying reasoning chain [24].\nAdditionally, these long-term responses tend to include redun-\ndant information and utilize pompous language [8], which further\nhampers the user’s comprehension process.\nC.4 Lack of Exploration Guidance: LLMs excel at supporting free-\nform exploration, with their extensive knowledge base enabling\nthem to answer a wide variety of user questions. However, their\npropensity for broad exploration can sometimes be overwhelming.\nWithout guidance, users often find themselves confused about\n\"what to ask next, and how?\" due to the sheer volume of content\navailable for inquiry [54, 55]. This issue is especially salient for\ncomplex topics that cannot be fully addressed with one single\nquestion, but requires iterative follow-up conversations [20].\nC.5 Absence of Goal-Achieving Indicator: LLMs typically do not\nhave an inherent mechanism for aligning its outputs with the\nuser’s goal of understanding a specific topic, which often varies\nfrom person to person. Users might find themselves navigating\nthrough an abundance of information without a clear sense of\n“how much more information is needed” for forming a desired\nVitamin D ...  \n??\nbenefit s?\nsaf ety?\nr esour ce?\nUser\nVitamin D is \nLLM\ndissolv es \nin\nhelp absorbis\nvitamin D\nf at\ndietar y \nsupplement\ncalcium\nExt ernal K G\nFig. 2: KNOW NET is designed to support the communication among three\ndistinct forms of knowledge: the knowledge users apply in their reasoning\nprocess, the knowledge contained within LLMs, and the knowledge\nstored in KGs.\nMat ching\nT e xt \nDialogue Gr aph Explor er\nNa vigat or\nLLM\nK G\nNe xt -St ep \nR ecommend\nHist or y Curr ent T opic\nUne xplor ed \nAr ea\nUser Int er f ace\nExplor ation T r acking\nKno wledge Base\nEnd t he \ne xploration\nNew Quer y\nFig. 3: System Overview.\nlevel of understanding. Often, they might quit the information\nseeking after asking the one or two questions (e.g., whether a drug\ncan be used for a disease), overlooking other important related\ninformation (e.g., the side effort of this drug).\n3.2 Three Forms of Knowledge\nKNOW NET aims to provide a systematic solution to the identified\nchallenges in information seeking via the integration of KGs. Therefore,\nKNOW NET needs to enable the communication among three distinct\nforms of knowledge, the one used in users’ reasoning process, the one\nstored in LLM, and the one contained in KG (Fig. 2). We consider\nthe process of understanding an object as progressively forming a\nknowledge graph about it. The external knowledge graph serves as a\nscaffold for organizing information, assessing LLM response, guiding\nexploration, and tracking the exploration progress.\nThis idea is driven by the observation that knowledge graphs, by\nnature, align with the principles of symbolic cognitive modeling, a clas-\nsic approach for modeling human cognitive process [50]. Knowledge\ngraphs represent information in a structured, symbolized format, using\nnodes to represent entities ( e.g., objects) and edges to represent the\nrelationships between these entities. This structured representation mir-\nrors the symbolic cognitive model, which posits that human cognition\noperates through the manipulation of discrete symbols, represented by\nthe nodes and edges in knowledge graphs. For example, understand-\ning the node [Paris] involves recognizing its connection through a\n[capital_of] edge to the node [France]. By actively, progressively\nconstructing a knowledge graph around the object of interest, users\nengage in a symbolic manipulation process, drawing connections and\nmaking inferences that enhance their understanding in a manner akin\nto typical human reasoning.\n3.3 System Overview\nKNOW NET consists of three main modules, a knowledge base, an ex-\nploration tracking module, and a user interface, as shown in Fig. 3. The\nknowledge base merges LLM and KG capabilities to deliver structured\nand verified responses to user inquiries. Based on the current query,\nKNOW NET extracts pertinent information from the KG and generates\nrecommendations for next-step exploration, which are then sent to\n3\nI heard there are relations between Vitamin E and Alzheimer's Disease?\nSubgraph\nRecommendationPoolAlzheimer’s …&VitaminE &VitaminE &…\nDoyouwanttoknowmoreaboutAlzheimer’s Diseaseand otherSupplements?\nRecommendationVitaminEAlzheimer’s DiseaseKG\nLLM\nExploration History\nVitaminEisAlzheimer’s Disease\nEvidencefromKG\nTextResponseGraphicalResponse\nt-1t\n0……\nOutputs\nInputad\nLLM-KG Matchingb\nContext Extractionc\nEmbedding\nMatchingMatching\nFig. 4: An overview of the back-end.

Finally, KNOW NET outputs text responses and visualizations\nthat organize the main relationships, provide evidence from the KG, and\nsuggest next-step recommendations (d).\nthe exploration tracking module. The user interface enables users to\ninteract with both the knowledge base and the exploration tracking\nmodule. Users can validate responses, explore recommendations, and\nadjust their exploration goals, determining whether to proceed with the\ncurrent conversation.\n4 I NTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE GRAPH\nIn this section, we outline our approach for integrating external KG\nwith LLMs to address the identified design challenges (C.1-C.5). Fig. 4\nshows the overview of the back-end structure. We focus on using\nKG to enhance user interactions with LLMs, complementing existing\nstudies that have used KGs to improve the pre-training, fine-tuning, and\ninference processes of LLMs.\nFor the LLM, we selected GPT4 as it is the state-of-the-art method.\nFor the KG, we utilized ADInt [52], a KG we developed in earlier\nstudies by extracting information on Non-pharmaceutical interventions\nand Alzheimer’s Disease from biomedical literature. This comprehen-\nsive KG comprises 162,212 nodes (15 types of entities such as drug,\ndisease, symptoms) and 1,017,284 edges (the relation between entities),\nincorporating a total of 754,224 pieces of scientific literature. ADInt\nserves as a testbed in this study and the proposed method is designed\nfor easy adaptation with other knowledge graphs, especially consider-\ning the broad availability of knowledge graph datasets across various\ndomains [34].\n4.1 Respond to current query (C.1, C.2)\nAfter a user poses a question, KNOW NET responds by combining the\nLLM outputs and the related information from KG (Fig. 4(b)).\nThe LLM will first determine whether the user question falls\nwithin the scope of the KG. If the query is outside the KG’s scope,\nKNOW NETwill function the same way as a standard LLM chat. Other-\nwise, the LLM will be prompted to annotate triples for extracting struc-\ntured information from the unstructured text (C.1). One triple consist\nof two entities and their relation. Inspired by the prompting strategies in\nGraphologue [17], we prompted the LLM to assign a unique identifier\nfor each entity (n1, n2, ...) and their relations (r1, r2, ...) simultaneously\nduring text generation. For example, in the response “[fish oil]($n1)\nis known for [containing]($r1, $n1, $n2) a rich content of [Omega-3\nfatty acids]($n2)”, GPT identifies one triple with two entities: fish\noil, denoted as n1, and Omega-3 fatty acids, denoted as n2, and their\nrelation, containing, denoted as r1.\nWe then match these triples with the KG to extract related literature\nand provide assistance in verification (C.2). Specifically, we generate\nembedding vectors for the nodes in the KG and the entities in the LLM\noutputs using the same embedding model, the text-embedding-ada-002\nmodel from OpenAI. Given a new LLM triple (ni, r, nk), we identify\nthe corresponding KG nodes by calculating and comparing the cosine\nsimilarity of their embeddings to those of the nodes within the triple,\nas shown in Fig. 4(b). We then search in the KG to find whether the\ntwo entities are connected via either one- or two-hop paths. These\npaths connecting entities are derived from mining biomedical literature,\nproviding useful insights for interpreting and validating LLM responses.\nNew knowledge can be integrated into KNOW NETby updating the KG\nthrough the insertion of new entities and paths. As noted in previous\nstudies [42, 53], the biomedical literature is a preferred resource to\ncalibrate user trust with AI tools. It is important to note that KG paths\nbetween two entities do not always imply the same relation in the LLM\ntriple. This discrepancy is particularly pronounced due to the ambiguity\nof text. For example, “slow the progress” does not equal to “treating”\na disease. Similarly to node matching, we applied text embedding to\ncompare relations suggested by LLM with those identified in the KG.\nWe consider these relations to be equivalent if the cosine similarity of\ntheir embedding vectors exceeds a certain threshold, which may need\nrefinement based on the specific KGs and embedding methods used. In\nour implementation, we set the threshold at 0.94 based on experiments.\n4.2 Recommend further explorations (C.4, C.5)\nKNOW NET generates recommendations considering both the KG struc-\ntured neighborhood and the user exploration history (C.4), as shown in\nFig. 4(c). Even though we can generate next-step recommendations by\nprompting GPT, e.g., “please suggest relevant questions for further ex-\nploration. ”, it offers limited control to the users. Therefore, we used the\nstructured information in KG to provide customizable recommendation.\nWe categorize user queries Q into two main categories based on the\nformat: the relation between a node and a node type , or the relation\nbetween a node and another node.\nQ = (N, {T |N′})\nwhere T represent node types andN represent nodes. For example, with\nvitamin E as the node, query examples include “which disorders can\nvitamin E improve” (a node and a node type), “is vitamin E helpful for\nAlzheimer’s disease” (a node and another node). Our recommendations\nare crafted following such query patterns.\nWe model user state based on their exploration history following the\nn-context analysis outlined by Milo and Somech [31]. We denote the\nuser’s current state using the previous queries posed by users,\ncontextt = (q0, q1, ...,qt )\nwhere q0, q1, ...,qt ∈ Q represent the query at corresponding time steps\n0, 1, ...t. With this modeling, we are able to map users’ current state\nas a sequence of nodes or node types and map them into the KG,\nwhich serves as a foundation for recommending queries for further\nexploration.\nTo model of the goal of an information seeking process (C.5), we\nextract the one-hop neighbors of the entities mentioned in the user’s\ninitial query from the KG, assuming the initial query reflects the primary\nobjective of their information search. In other words,\nSubgraphQ =\n[\nni∈n1,n2,..,nk\nNeighbor(ni)\nwhere n1, n2, nk ∈ N are the entities mentioned by the users in the initial\nquery, SubgraphQ is the neighborhood in KG that contains potential\nsubjects for exploration.\nRecommendations =\n[\nni∈context∧{nj |tk}∈SubgraphQ\n(ni, nj|tk)\nWe then use a rule-based template to convert the candidate queries into\nnatural language questions.\nThis recommendation mechanism may not always align with unique\ngoal of individual users in their information seeking. For example,\nusers may only care about the benefits of vitamin E but not its physiol-\nogy aspect, even though both aspects are treated as equally important\n4\n© 2024 IEEE.

Users can log into the tool via GitHub or Google account and securely store their chat history (A1-A2). The main\ninterface consists of a Text Dialogue(B), a Graphical Explorer(C), and a Navigator (D). Information validation (E) and next-step recommendations\n(F) are provided to facilitate the exploration.\nin the KG. To address this issue, we update the recommendation pool\nbased on two types of user feedback. First, users can remove recom-\nmendations that don’t capture their interest. Second, they can pose\nnew, highly relevant questions that are not in the recommendations.\nThe recommendation pool is dynamically updated, removing these less\nrelevant queries and incorporating new suggestions by updating the\nSgubgraphQ with new entities in user-added questions.\n5 V ISUAL INTERFACE\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the interface of KNOW NET consists of three main\ncomponents, a Text Dialogue (B), a Graphical Explorer (C), and a\nNavigator (D). The Text Dialogue presents the text response to the\ncurrent query, highlighting related entities and their relations for seam-\nless integration with the Graph Explorer. The Graph Explorer not\nonly represents the text responses as graphical representations but also\nenables easy validation of these responses by matching the information\nwith evidence in the KG. Previous exploration is also summarized in\nthe Graph Explorer, enabling users to easily connect the current query\nto previous explorations and next-step recommendations. The Graph\nExplorer is updated according to the Navigator module. The Navigator\nallows users to revisit previous queries, gauge their progress in explo-\nration, and submit queries based on recommendations. Although we\ndescribe the interface as three separate modules for clarity, they are\nseamlessly integrated with one another.\n5.1 Information Seeking with KNOWNET\nWe introduce the components and interactions in KNOW NET demon-\nstrating how it can guide users in information seeking and solve the\ndesign challenges.\n5.1.1 Connecting LLM with KG\nTo start with, users will post a question about an object of interest,\nsuch as “what are the benefits of taking vitamin D?”. As outlined in\nSec. 4.1, we extract triples (e.g., entities and their relationships) from\nthe GPT outputs and match them with KG data. During the streaming\ngeneration process, identified entities are highlighted in gray and their\nrelations are underlined (Fig. 5(B)).\nUpon successfully matching these entities within the KG, the iden-\ntified entities and their relations are updated to Graph Explorer as a\nnode-link diagram. We apply color coding to indicate differentiate node\ntypes, such as drugs, diseases, and physiological aspects. Entities in\nthe Text Dialogue and the Graph Explorer share the same color coding\nand are synchronized, as shown in Fig. 5(C). Hovering over an entity in\none view will highlight the corresponding entity in the other view. This\nsuppor t i r ele v ant ? unsur e\nentity entityLLMb\nK G\nr elation \nentity\nentity\nInt er f acea\nr elation|    9\ntype of \nmatching number of \npapers\nc\nFig. 6: Edge labels. KNOW NET suggests three different edge labels,\nsupport, relevant, and unsure, based on the matching between KG and\nLLM. sim(n1, n′\n1) indicates the cosine similarity between the the entity\nidentified in LLM ( n1) and the nodes in KG ( n′\n1). θn and θr are the\nthresholds for entity and relation matching.\ncoordination between Text Dialogue and Graph Explorer enables an\nintuitive presentation of nonlinear entity relations (C.1) and provides\na concise representation of the main message in potentially long texts\n(C.3). Unlike Graphologue [17], we choose not to update the graph\nsimultaneously for two main reasons. First, the sheer size of the KG\nmay introduce delays. Second, the complex structure of responses to\nmedical queries makes simultaneous monitoring of both text and graph\npotentially overwhelming for users.\nUsers can click on the node in Graph Explorer to highlight the\ncorresponding entities in the GPT outputs. Users can also move nodes\nthrough drag-and-drop to better organize the node layout.\n5.1.2 Verification with Evidence\nWe provide various edge labels and pop-up details inGraph Explorer\nto aid users in evaluating the quality of a relation (C.2). As shown in\nFig. 6(a), each label consists of three components: the name of the\nrelation, one of three classifications (Support, Relevant, or Unsure),\nand the number of related literature found in the KG. Clicking on the\nlabel opens a pop-up window that lists the relevant literature and allows\nusers to dive deeper into these evidences, as shown in Fig. 5(E).\nWe classify the quality of the relations as support, relevant, and\nunsure, based on the matching between KG and LLM (Fig. 6(b-c)).\nThe support label ✓ is assigned when GPT-mentioned relations can be\ndirectly corroborated with evidence found in the KG. The relevant label\ni will be assigned in two scenarios. First, this label will be assigned\nif a similar but not identical relation is found in the KG compared to\nwhat GPT mentioned. For example, GPT might suggest that a drug can\nslow the progression of a condition, but the KG shows the drug can\nprevent a condition. Secondly, this label will be assigned if no direct\nlink exists between two entities, but a two-hop path is discoverable in\n5\nomega- 3 f atty acids Vitamin E\nAlzheimer ’ s Disease\nslo ws|    8 help |    10\nVitamin E\nAlzheimer ’ s Disease\nslo ws|    8 help |    10\nantio xidant activity\nNeur ons\npr ot ect |    0 i\nhas |    2\ndisrupt |    2\nomega- 3 f atty acids Vitamin E\nAlzheimer ’ s Disease antio xidant activity\nNeur ons\nslo ws|    8 help |    10 has |    2\ndisrupt |    2 Oxidativ e Str ess\ndamage|    1\ncoe xist |    9 neutraliz e|    2\nWhich supplement s ma y benefit \nAlzheimer ’ s Disease?\nWh y is Vitamin E helpful f or AD?\nPlease e xplain t he r elation betw een \nantio xidant activity and neur ons.\nomega- 3 f atty acids Vitamin E\nAlzheimer ’ s Disease\nslo ws|    8 help |    10\n1 32\nBack\n Ne xt\nFig. 7: Step by step exploration. In KNOW NET, users seek information\nwhile progressively constructing a graph about it. With each step, newly\nadded edges and nodes are highlighted, whereas elements from previous\nsteps are faded. This design aims to help users concentrate on the\ncurrent query while still retaining an awareness of the overall context.\nthe KG, suggesting potential underlying mechanisms that could support\nthe relation. The unsure label ? will be assigned to relations to which\nneither the Support nor Relevant labels apply. In addition to adding\nthe question icons, we distinguish unsure relations with a dashed line,\nenhancing user understanding of the relation’s credibility.\n5.1.3 Next Step Recommendation\nKNOW NET offers next-step recommendations in both the Navigator\nand the Graph Explorer to encourage further exploration ( C.4), as\nshown in Fig. 5(F). In the Navigator, recommendations are displayed\nabove the input box, with the top three suggestions presented as in-\ndividual buttons. Additional recommendations become visible upon\nhovering over the “More” button. Meanwhile, in the Graph Explorer,\nrecommendations are linked to relevant nodes in the graph, aiding\nusers in integrating these suggestions into the context of their ongo-\ning exploration. Clicking on a button will automatically submit the\ncorresponding recommended query to KNOW NET.\nThere may be instances where the recommendations do not fully\nalign with the unique goals of individual users, particularly when there\nis a limited chat history available. In such cases, users have the option\nto dismiss recommendations by clicking on the cross icon or to enter\ntheir own query into the input box.\n5.1.4 Progress Tracking\nAs users ask questions and progressively build a comprehensive un-\nderstanding, the process can also result in an overwhelming amount\nof information, causing them to lose track of the query process [43]\nTherefore, we provide a Navigator that both structurally organizes ex-\nploration histories (C.3) and indicates the ratio of explored area within\nthe knowledge graph neighborhood (C.5).\nIn the Navigator (Fig. 5(D)), each dot in the stepper indicates a\nquery. KNOW NET uses a linear Navigator to prioritize a familiar and\nstraightforward navigation experience for users. Hovering on a dot\nwill reveal the corresponding query text in a tooltip, and clicking on\nthe dot navigates to the page of this query. In the query’s page, Text\nDialogue shows the text response to this query and Graph Explorer\nwill highlight the relevant nodes and their relations, fading previous\nexplorations, and hiding explorations after this query, as shown in Fig. 7.\nCompared to the scrolling-down layout of traditional conversational\nchatbot, this design enable users to focus one specific query without\nlosing the context (C.3), embodying the focus+context design principle\nprevalent in visualization.\nAdditionally, a circular progress bar on the stepper’s right side shows\nthe proportion of the neighboring area in KG explored by the user\n(C.5). This target neighborhood is dynamically updated as users dismiss\nrecommendations or introduce new queries, ensuring a tailored and\nmanageable exploration experience.\n5.2 Account Management and Chat Histories\nKNOW NET allows users to sign in using either their GitHub or Google\naccounts and requires an OpenAI API key at the sign-in page. This\nintegration is achieved through NextAuth.js [10], a library for Next.js\nthat provides a simple and secure solution for handling authentication in\nserver-side rendering and static site generation applications. By using\nOAuth providers like GitHub and Google, we offer users a convenient\nway to access KNOW NET and maintain user data security.\nChat histories are stored on Vercel KV [41], a durable Redis database\nthat enables the storage and retrieval of JSON data. Storing chat his-\ntories ensure that users’ conversation histories are preserved across\nsessions. Users can revisit previous conversations and continue their\nresearch from where they left off. More importantly, these histories can\nbe used for generating a more personalized recommendation pool.\nOverall, the account management and chat histories in KNOW NET\nenhance the usability and effectiveness of the system, providing users\nwith a more personalized and continuous research experience.\n5.3 Implementation\nThe implementation of KNOW NET involves a front-end for user inter-\naction and a back-end for data processing and AI model integration.\nThe front-end is developed using Next.js [40] to enable server-side\nrendering and static site generation. The chat functionality is pow-\nered by the Vercel AI SDK [40], which provides a streamlined way\nto integrate AI chat models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, into the ap-\nplication. Chat history and sessions are stored on Vercel KV [40],\nensuring that the user’s conversation history is preserved across ses-\nsions. For authentication, NextAuth.js [10] is integrated into the ap-\nplication, providing a simple and secure solution for managing user\nauthentication and session management. The back-end of is built us-\ning Flask [14], a lightweight Python web framework. Flask serves\nas the bridge between the front-end and the graph database, where\nNeo4j [32] is utilized to store and retrieve knowledge graph data.\nThe source code and documentation for KNOW NET are available at\nhttps://visual-intelligence-umn.github.io/KNOWNET/.\n6 E VALUATION\nA total of 15 use cases were conducted to showcase the utility and\nusability of KNOW NET, performed by the three domain experts on our\nauthor team. Each use case involved a series of dialogues centered on\none specific question related to dietary supplements.\nIn this section, we first present three representative use cases from\nthe set of 15. Following this, we discuss our observations and the errors\nencountered across all use cases. Lastly, we conducted expert inter-\nviews with two additional domain experts who are not paper authors,\nfurther enriching our analysis and findings.\n6.1 Use Cases\nWe first report three representative cases that simulated different usage\nscenarios, as shown in Fig. 8, and then discuss our observations from\nconducting the 15 cases.\n6.1.1 Case One: Verification via Literature\nThis case (Fig. 8(a)) demonstrates howKNOW NET can help users verify\ninformation. The user inquired about the impact of one specific dietary\nsupplement on Alzheimer’s disease. In response to the query“Can Pro-\ncaine slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease?”, KNOW NET stated\nthat: “Procaine may have potential benefits in slowing the progression\nof Alzheimer’s disease. The retrieved triple ([Procaine]-[prevents]-\n>[Alzheimer’s Disease]) was incorporated into the Graph Explorer,\nwith a support label ✓ and corresponding literature evidence. The\nuser can then read the corresponding paper to seek further information\nabout the relation between Procaine and Alzheimer’s disease.\n6.1.2 Case Two: Integrating Information from LLM and KG\nThis case (Fig. 8(b)) shows how KNOW NET integrates information\nfrom both LLM and KG for effective information seeking. The user\ninvestigated different drugs by beginning with, “Can rivastigmine treat\n6\n© 2024 IEEE.

Curious for more\ndetails about this supplement, the user pursued a recommended query,\n“Can you tell me more about Rivastigmine and Disorders?”. KNOW NET\nindicated that “Rivastigmine is also used to treat Parkinson’s disease\ndementia. ”However, KNOW NET did not find a direct edge between\nParkinson’s disease and Rivastigmine, resulting in number 0 on the\nedge label. On the other hand, the KG found that Parkinson’s disease\ncan be connected to Rivastigmine via the node Alzheimer’s disease\n(B2), leading to a relevant label i rather than an unsure label ? .\nUsers further examined the two-hop path via Alzheimer’s disease and\nbelieved it cannot help verify the relation between Parkinson’s disease\nand Rivastigmine. This observation suggested potential inaccuracies in\nthe information provided by the LLM.\n6.1.3 Case Three: Guided Exploration\nThis case (Fig. 8(c)) shows how KNOW NET supports guided explo-\nration with recommendations and progressive visualizations. The user\nstarted with asking “Which supplement may slow the progression of\nAlzheimer’s disease?” KNOW NET suggested Omega-3 fatty acids and\nvitamin E, noting that “Omega-3 fatty acids may slow the progression\nof Alzheimer’s disease” and “Vitamin E has been studied for its poten-\ntial to slow cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease”. The retrieved\ntriples ([Omega-3 fatty acids]-[affects]->[Alzheimer’s Disease]) and\n([Vitamin E]-[affects]->[Alzheimer’s Disease]) were also updated in the\ngraph with support edge labels ✓ . Based on the previous answer, the\nuser was interested in one supplement, Omega-3 fatty acids, proposed\nby KNOW NET, and want to know which other disorders can benefit\nfrom taking this supplement. This question was exactly recommended\nby KNOW NET and displayed above the input box as “Omega-3 fatty\nacids and Disorders.” The user clicked on the responding button and\nKNOW NET generated responses accordingly: omega-3 fatty acids can\nbe used for reducing heart disorders, slowing down the progression of\nneurodegenerative disorders and managing mood disorders. These\nrelations were also updated to theGraph Explorer with supporting edge\nlabels ✓ . In Graph Explorer, nodes relevant to the current query (i.e.,\nmood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders) are highlighted, aiding\nusers in maintaining focus without getting overwhelmed by other nodes\nin the graph.\nThe user then revisited earlier steps to inquire about another rec-\nommended supplement, vitamin E. The user selected the recom-\nmended question from KNOW NET, “why vitamin E can be helpful\nfor Alzheimer’s?”. KNOW NET responded with “Antioxidant prop-\nerties” and their effect on “neurons” to explain why vitamin E was\nrecommended. As show in Fig. 8(C3), a relevant label i on the\nedge indicated that there are no direct edges, but there are two-hop\npaths in the KG connecting the two nodes. Consequently, the user\npursued further clarification by selecting a KNOW NET suggested ques-\ntion, asking, “Can you tell me more about Antioxidant properties and\nneurons?” The answer introduced a new concept (Fig. 8(C4)), “Ox-\nidative stress”, which was linked to both “Antioxidant properties” and\n“neurons” with support edge labels ✓ . These links helped validate the\nrelation between “Antioxidant properties” and “neurons”.\n6.1.4 Observations\nComplementarity between LLM and KG:LLMs can add context and\ndetails to the abstract and inflexible structures of KG, while KGs can\nenhance LLMs with accuracy and structured knowledge. The use cases\nshow how LLM and KG can mutually enhance each other’s capabilities.\nFirst, LLM and KG can complement each other by providing infor-\nmation from different resources. An instance of KG enhancing LLM\n7\nG ink go biloba\nAlzheimer ’ s Disease\nbenefit s|    0 ?\nG ink go biloba e xtract\nAlzheimer ’ s Disease\nbenefit s |    8\nG ink go bioba has been \nstudied f or t heir pot ential \nbenefit s in Alzheimer ’ s \ndisease.

Conversely, an example of LLM augmenting KG\nis observed in the second Q&A of Case 2. The LLM introduces a\ntriple ([Rivastigmine]-[treats]-> [Parkinson’s disease dementia]) that\nis not previously recorded in the KG. Therefore, the KG leveraged a\ntwo-hop path ([Rivastigmine]-[treats]->[Alzheimer’s disease]-[coexists\nwith]->[Parkinson’s disease dementia]) to suggest Rivastigmine’s appli-\ncability in treating a closely related disease. This strategy is frequently\nemployed in drug repurposing [42]. Although the validity of this rela-\ntion requires further verification, it underscores the significant potential\nof LLMs to enhance the quality of the KG.\nSecond, the integration of text and graphical representation through\nLLM and KG collaboration enables varied perspectives for data in-\nterpretation. The textual descriptions generated by LLMs can offer\nnuanced explanations and background information. Take the Omega-\n3 fatty acids in Case 3 as an example, the text description included\ninformation about its resource “rich in fish oil” and main properties\n“anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties”. At the same time,\nthe visual graphs provide a clear, immediate summary of the connec-\ntion between Omega-3 fatty acids and Alzheimer’s disease. More\nimportantly, the abstract nature of the graph facilitates easier recall of\nprevious explorations, offering a contextual backdrop for understanding\nthe current query. In contrast, extensive text segments tend to focus\nnarrowly on information pertinent to the immediate query.\nCommon Issues: Analysis of the 15 cases also revealed various issues\nin the integration of LLM and KG, which we summarize as below.\nFirst, aligning general language terms from LLM output to these\nstandardized terms in KG can lead to inaccuracies. The inherent am-\nbiguity of natural language can lead to LLM-generated entity and\nrelation names being broad and nonspecific. At the same time, domains\nrequiring high precision often rely on standardized terminology for\nclarity and consistency, such as the Unified Medical Language System\n(UMLS) [5] used in KNOW NET. It is possible that a term used by an\nLLM is vague and can match multiple nodes in KG. For example, as\nshown in Fig. 9(a), even though the KG contains evidence to support\nthe relation [Ginkgo biloba extract]->[benefit]->[Alzheimer’s Disease],\nLLM use a broder term “Ginkgo biloba”, which was matched to the\nnode “Ginkgo biloba” rather than “Ginkgo biloba extract” in KG. This\nresults in a unsure label ? for the relation.\nSecond, KGs are usually limited to specific domains and cannot\nbe used to validate information outside those domains. In the current\nimplementation, the Graph Explorer will not be updated if LLM de-\ntermines that a question falls outside the KG’s scope. However, this\napproach can fall short for common-sense knowledge within a field,\nwhich is often not explicitly detailed in research articles. For example,\nthe widely recognized fact that “fish oil is rich in Omega-3 fatty acids”\nis labeled as relevant i rather than support ✓ , as shown in Fig. 9(b).\nThird, GPT4 tend to be overly cautious, often using vague terms\nand occasionally refusing to answer certain questions. For instance,\nwhen queried about the connection between Procaine and Alzheimer’s\nDisease, an LLM responded with the statement, “Procaine may have\npotential benefits in slowing the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease.”\nThis cautious approach of GPT can sometimes make KNOW NET un-\nresponsive to user questions. However, it can also result in fewer\ninstances than expected of uncertain edge labels ? in the use cases.\nFourth, even though integrating the additional graphical format can\nsignificantly address the issues in traditional linear textual description,\nnot all knowledge can be effectively represented as graphs. For exam-\nple, consider the sentence “Oxidative stress is related to the process of\nneuronal damage, as it involves the accumulation of harmful reactive\noxygen species that can damage neurons”. This sentence involves mul-\ntiple triples, such as [Oxidative stress]-[related to]->[neuronal damage],\n[reactive oxygen species]-[damage]->[neurons], [Oxidative stress]-\n[damage]->[neurons], [Oxidative stress]-[accumulate]->[harmful reac-\ntive oxygen species]. Representing all these triples can be overwhelm-\ning. To tackle this issue, in the current implementation, we prompted\nGPT to annotate the most important triple from each sentence for vali-\ndation with KG. However, these annotations are not always accurate\nand can lead to the oversight of critical knowledge.\n6.2 Expert Interview\nIn addition to the three domain experts on our author team, we con-\nducted interviews with two further experts (E1, E2) specializing in\ncomputational health informatics and medical research. E1 is a re-\nsearch scientist in medical informatics, holds a PhD degree, and has 8\nyears of experience in pharmacy and EHR data analysis. E2 is a PhD\ncandidate in health informatics with 4 years of research experience.\nE2 has a strong clinical background with an MBBS degree, which\nis equivalent to an MD in the US. These interviews aimed to obtain\ninsights into the usability, effectiveness, and areas for improvement of\nKNOW NET. The two additional experts are not authors of this paper.\nEach interview lasted approximately 60 minutes.\n• Introduction (10 minutes). We began by providing a background\noverview and demonstrating the various components and functionali-\nties of KNOW NET.\n• Case Presentation (20 minutes). Following this introduction, we\npresented two specific use cases, Case 2 and Case 3 as detailed in\nSec. 6.1. We also provided the responses from GPT-4 of the same\nquestions for comparison. This segment was designed to familiarize\nthe experts with KNOW NET’s usage and work flow. During the\ndemonstration, experts were encouraged to interrupt with questions\nand comments.\n• Free Exploration (15 minutes). We allowed the experts 15 minutes of\nfree exploration of the system, during which they were encouraged to\nthink aloud and vocalize their thoughts. This interactive session was\nclosely observed, with our team taking detailed notes on the experts’\ninteractions with KNOW NET.\n• Discussion (15 minutes). The interview concluded with a semi-\nstructured discussion, during which we collected feedback on five\ncritical aspects: the accuracy of information provided, clarity of\nexplanations, relevance of responses and recommendations, coverage\nof essential topics, and the system’s overall ease of use.\nUsability. Both experts commented that it was easy and intuitive\nto use the system without further assistance from the interviewers,\nstating all these features “basically have no learning curve involved”\n(E1). They were particularly impressed with KNOW NET’s ability in\nelucidating the connections between entities and surfacing pertinent\nliterature. They also expressed that the progressive visualization and\next-step recommendations are useful features to guide exploration.\n8\n© 2024 IEEE.

The final version of this record is available at: xx.xxxx/TVCG.201x.xxxxxxx/\nWilling to Use. The experts emphasized their frequent reliance\non evidence-based resources like UpToDate [21] for accessing drug\nand medical information, underscoring the importance of accuracy and\ncredibility in their work. For instance, E1 highlighted a hesitancy to\nutilize GPT, “I rarely used GPT for those questions, due to concerns\nabout its accuracy. ” Both experts stated that tools like KNOW NET\nwhich integrate literature for supporting evidence, could dramatically\nshift their perspective on the utilization of AI-powered tools in their\nprofessional activities. The ability of KNOW NET to directly link to and\nleverage verified scientific articles not only bolsters the trustworthiness\nof the information provided but also aligns with the experts’ existing\npractices of evidence-based verification [44, 53].\nComparing KNOW NET with GPT-4. Both experts commented on\nthe differences between KNOW NET and GPT. First, compared with\nthe well-structured response from KNOW NET, GPT responses are\nmuch longer and redundant, with several sentences repeating similar\npoints. For the same question “Which factors can trigger Alzheimer’s\nto get worse?” , GPT responses include more than 10 factors while\nKNOW NET typical try to focus on the most important two or three\nfactors. Apart from the amount of the information, E1 also appreciated\nthat the graph works as an effective scaffold to help track and organize\nthe information, especially when dealing with multiple entities. Sec-\nond, E2 noted that GPT often employs an uncertain tone, for instance,\ncharacterizing a factor by saying it “has been studied for its potential\nin slowing the progression of...” Such phrasing might mitigate the risk\nof providing inaccurate responses, but tends to render the information\n“less useful”(E2) in making decisions or gaining insights. Third, both\nexperts mentioned that highlighting relevant entities and relations in\nthe text can help them effectively grasp the main points, offering a clear\nadvantage over the undifferentiated text produced by GPT.\nSuggested Improvements. The experts offered insightful sugges-\ntions for enhancing KNOW NET. E1 proposed allowing the integration\nof user-provided KGs into the system to help KNOW NET comprehen-\nsively identify reference articles and broaden the scope of supported\nevidences. E1 also suggested granting users the capability to evaluate\nthe quality of the KGs integrated in KNOW NET. These suggests are\nmade considering the critical links between KG quality and the reliabil-\nity of KNOW NET’s outputs. Meanwhile, E2 recommended providing\nusers with the option to customize the verbosity and detail level of\ntextual responses. This feature would accommodate varying user pref-\nerences and capacities for processing information, ensuring KNOW NET\ncan cater to a diverse range of needs.\n7 D ISCUSSION\nGenerality: We developed and assessed KNOW NET within the do-\nmain of dietary supplements, a field where access to scientifically\nvalidated information is crucial due to widespread exaggerated claims\nand misinformation. Our evaluation highlights KNOW NET’s efficacy\nin this particular context, and we are confident that our approach can\nbe broadly applied to other areas. Firstly, KNOW NET is well-suited for\ndomains where users typically use evidence-backed knowledge from\nscholarly literature for reasoning and decision making. Secondly, it is\napplicable to information-seeking scenarios where data can be effec-\ntively organized as a graph, and the understanding can benefit from a\nstep-by-step exploration.\nScalability: Even though the proposed method represents a significant\nimprovement over traditional linear conversation methods, challenges\nmay arise as the volume of content increases. Specifically, managing\nand navigating within a graph that contains large number of nodes\nand edges may become cumbersome for users. To tackle this problem,\nforthcoming improvements could aim at incorporating hierarchical\nstructures and offering multiple abstraction levels. This would allow\nusers to initially engage with a broad overview, delve into detailed\ninformation for areas of interest, and seamlessly transition between\ndifferent abstraction layers. Adaptive interface is another promising\nresearch direction for addressing this issue. By learning the desired\nlevel of abstraction from interaction logs, the interface can dynamically\nadjust accordingly to suit the exploration needs of different users.\nInherent limitations related to KG: Inherent limitations associated\nwith KGs must be acknowledged despite their effectiveness in repre-\nsenting structured knowledge. While KGs offer a powerful means of\norganizing and manipulating knowledge, they may not fully capture the\ncomplexity of human cognition, especially aspects that are less struc-\ntured or context-dependent. In future research, we plan to investigate\nthe integration of other formats of knowledge ( e.g., images, tabluar\ndata, maps) to further facilitate the information seeking with LLMs.\nMeanwhile, it’s crucial to recognize the information validation sup-\nported in KNOW NET is confined to the scope of the integrated KG.\nWhen a relation cannot be validated within the KG, it does not nec-\nessarily imply that the relation is untrue. As a result, users should be\ncareful when interpreting the validation information derived from KGs.\nA promising future direction would be to dynamically integrate user\nknowledge into the system [9, 44].\nFurther Enhancement of the Interface: While the effectiveness of\nthe current KNOW NET interface is demonstrated in our evaluation, its\nfocus on intuitiveness and familiarity presents opportunities for further\nimprovement of advanced feature in future studies. For instance, the\ncurrent linear navigator could be expanded to include a tree-based\noption. This would allow users to more effectively track and compare\ndifferent exploration paths related to a specific question. Additionally,\nthe layout can be improved to a more semantic design that incorporates\nthe embedding of graph nodes and supports focus + context interactions,\nwhich would facilitate the interpretation of larger and more complex\nknowledge relationships.\nLimitations of the Evaluation: The evaluation of KNOW NET has\nlimited user data, making it challenging to conduct quantitative assess-\nments for both the whole system and the critical components such as\nentity matching and recommendation. To mitigate this limitation, our\nstudy emphasizes a close involvement of domain experts, gathering\ntimely feedback during weekly meetings. The use cases and the expert\ninterview demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of the proposed\nsystem. At the same time, we recognize limitations in the current\nevaluation, such as restricted perspectives and limited generalizabil-\nity. To address these issues, we plan to expand user participation in\nfollow-up studies. Increasing the number of participants will enhance\nthe robustness of our evaluation and provide a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of user behaviors through the analysis of chat texts and\ninteraction logs.\n8 C ONCLUSION\nIn conclusion, this paper presents KNOW NET, a visualization system\nthat integrates LLMs with KGs to address the challenges of accuracy\nand structured exploration in health information seeking. KNOW NET\ntackles these issues of accuracy through the extraction and mapping of\ntriples from LLM outputs to validated information in external KGs. It\nfacilitates structured step-by-step exploration by providing recommen-\ndation based on KG neighborhood analysis, ensuring a comprehensive\nunderstanding without overlooking critical aspects. Furthermore, to mit-\nigate information overload during multi-step exploration, KNOW NET\nemploys a focus+context design and introduces progressive graph vi-\nsualization to track previous inquiries and connect them with current\nqueries and next-step recommendations.\nOur study demonstrates the effectiveness of KNOW NET in one crit-\nical application, dietary supplements, through use cases and expert\ninterviews. We believe the proposed methods can be generalized to\nother similar application where structured exploration and validation\nthrough literature are essential.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank the anonymous reviewers and the study participants\nfor their valuable comments.
