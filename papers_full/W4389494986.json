    "abstract": "Large Language Models(LLM) based on the Transformer architecture is nowadays one of the most widely used tool in Natural Language Processing(NLP) field. Nonetheless this approach has some limitations and flaws. In particular, these problems become crucial for the NLP-based expert systems. The LLMs may sometimes hallucinate and provide non-trustworthy responses. We will advocate the using of Knowledge Graphs for solving this problem.",
