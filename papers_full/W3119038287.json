INTRODUCTION\nThe hot spot temperature (HST) of transformer winding has\nan important inﬂuence on the transformer operation life and\nload capacity. The continuous monitoring of transformer HST\ncan conducive to a more accurate control of the load, the real-\nization of the transformer dynamic capacity increase, and the\navoidance of transformer failure due to overheating. Besides,\nit is helpful to evaluate the transformer oil paper residual\ninsulation life and provides reference for the transformer\nwhole life cycle management [1]. The transformer HST can\nbe detected by inserting the optical ﬁber temperature sensors\ninto the positions which are supposed to be the hot spot of\nthe winding [2], [3], but it is difﬁcult to apply the optical\nﬁber sensors to the transformer in operation; As the struc-\nture and the heat dissipation process of the transformer are\nvery complicated, the key parameters such as heat capacities\nand thermal resistances in the thermal circuit are difﬁcult to\nobtain accurately, thus the indirect calculation methods such\nas empirical formula [4] and thermal model [5] are difﬁcult to\naccurately describe the thermal features of transformer, which\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Yonghong Peng\n.\nmakes it difﬁcult to accurately obtain the HST of transformer\nwinding. Therefore, how to obtain the HST accurately and\nquickly is of great signiﬁcance to ensure the safe and stable\noperation of the transformer.\nIn order to detect the transformer HST simply and efﬁ-\nciently, it has become the research direction of many scholars\nto use artiﬁcial intelligence algorithm to retrieve the HST\naccording to the transformer operation data. The advantage\nof using artiﬁcial intelligence algorithm to detect the trans-\nformer HST lies in that the factors such as the structure of\ntransformer, the non-uniformity of material and the inﬂu-\nence of environment condition are directly considered in the\nlearning process of training samples, and the trained model\ncan be used in the HST detection of transformer in opera-\ntion. Take the load current, ambient temperature as the input\nfeatures, the transformer HST or top oil temperature (TOT)\ncan be detected with artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) [6]–\n[9]. In view of the fact that the model provided by IEEE\ntransformer load guide has a large error in detecting the\nHST under overload condition, take the load current, ambient\ntemperature and TOT as the inputs, V . Galdi and L. Ippolito\ndetected the HST of a 25 kV A distribution transformer with\nradial basis function neural network (RBFN), the accuracy\nVOLUME 9, 2021 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Ruanet al.: Inversion Detection of Transformer Transient HST\nof the model is evaluated according to the test data and it\noutperforms the IEEE empirical formula [10], [11]. Q. He\ndiscussed the feasibility of three different neural network in\nthe transformer TOT detection, and the results show that the\ntemporal processing networks can achieve the most accurate\nprediction [12]. Fuzzy neural system was also used to detect\nthe transformer HST, and the fuzzy neural system requires\na less calculation and can achieve a higher accuracy than\nthe multilayer neural network and RBFN network, besides,\nthe fuzzy neural system has a better anti-noise ability [13]–\n[15]. Taken the load current and TOT as the inputs, L. Ippolito\ndetected the HST of a distribution transformer with Tagaki-\nSugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy model, and the high accuracy of\nTSK fuzzy model is veriﬁed by comparing the calculation\nresults with test data and IEEE empirical formula calculation\nresults [16]. D. Villacci applied the theory of grey system\nto the detection of transformer HST, realized the effective\ncombination of the IEEE empirical formula and machine\nlearning algorithm [17].\nIn addition to the above mentioned intelligent analysis\nmethod, support vector machine model is also used in the\ninversion of transformer HST. Support vector regression\n(SVR) with gradient descent optimization method was used\nto detect the HST of an oil immersed transformer [18]. SVR\nmethod was used to detect the HST in a 750MV A/500kV\npower transformer, and it has achieved a good detection result\n[19]. SVR method combined with information granulation\nwas proposed to detect the HST of a 15 MV A ODAF trans-\nformer, and it outperforms a number of existing thermal\nmodel based methods [20].\nThe above methods show the effectiveness of artiﬁcial\nintelligence algorithm in the calculation of transformer wind-\ning HST, in order to further study the transformer transient\nHST calculation method under complex working conditions,\nsuch as under changing load and different ambient wind\nspeed, in this paper, take an S13-M-100 kV A/10 kV distri-\nbution transformer as the research object, the transformer\ntemperature rise test under various working conditions is\ncarried out, and the transformer winding HST during the\ntemperature rise test is obtained with ﬂuorescent optical ﬁber.\nAt the same time, this paper established a reverse detection\nmethod of transformer winding HST under complex work-\ning conditions. In order to reﬂect the time lag relationship\nbetween the iron shell temperature measurement point and\nthe winding HST, a set of feature quantities which can reﬂect\nthe load change are proposed, combined with the temperature\npoints on the transformer iron shell, those quantities are\nproposed as the transient feature quantities of the inversion\nmodel, and the support vector regression (SVR) method is\nused to describe the complicated multi-dimensional nonlinear\nrelationship between the transformer HST and those feature\nquantities. Based on the established inversion model, the tran-\nsient HST of the transformer can be detected by monitoring\nthose feature quantities of the transformer. The HST inversion\nresults obtained with the proposed method agree well with\nthe transformer temperature rise test data, and the HST inver-\nFIGURE 1.

INVERSION METHOD OF TRANSFORMER TRANSIENT\nHOT SPOT TEMPERATURE\nA. TRANSFORMER TRANSIENT HST INVERSION METHOD\nIn the case of knowing the transformer load and external heat\ndissipation conditions, the transformer temperature ﬁeld can\nbe calculated based on the numerical calculation of trans-\nformer thermal ﬂuid ﬁeld, which can directly reﬂect the\ntransformer HST and the temperature distribution of trans-\nformer iron shell. Contrary to forward model, namely direct\ncalculation, the inverse model is the process of inferring the\ncause from the result, which is deﬁned as the estimation of\nparameters inside physical model using measured data [21].\nBased on the inversion detection idea, a set of feature tem-\nperature points on the transformer iron shell as well as other\nimportant transformer transient quantities which can reﬂect\nthe transformer load change are proposed as the feature\nquantities, the SVR method is used to describe the compli-\ncated multi-dimensional nonlinear relationship between the\ntransformer transient HST and those feature quantities.

BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF SVR\n1) BASIC PRINCIPLE OF SVR\nIn order to estimate a 10 kV oil-immersed transformer tran-\nsient HST. A set of transient feature quantities which can\nreﬂect the load change are proposed, those quantities as well\nas the transformer real time load rate, feature temperature\npoints on the transformer iron shell are taken as the input\nparameters x of a machine learning model established by\nSVR, thus to describe their relationships with the transformer\ntransient HST y.\nSVR is a widely used machine learning algorithm, based\non the structural risk minimization principle, it has a strong\nability in dealing with multi-dimensional non-linear prob-\nlems with relatively few samples [22], [23], the establishment\nprocess of SVR model can be simply expressed as follows:\nGiven a set of training samples (x i,yi), i =1,2,...,N, xi ∈\nRN , yi ∈R. A hyperplane can be applied to characterizing the\nrelationship between x and y, namely f (x) =ω·x +b, where\nω∈RN and b ∈R.\n|yi −f (xi)|≤ε, i =1,2,···, N (1)\nwhere ε is the insensitive loss coefﬁcient, xi is the input\nparameters, yi is the output parameter, namely the transformer\nHST.\nFor any point (x i,yi) in the training sample set, the distance\nto the hyperplane di can be expressed as:\ndi =|ω ·xi +b −yi|\n√\n1 +∥ω∥2 ≤ ε√\n1 +∥ω∥2 , i =1,2,···, N\n(2)\nThe optimal hyperplane should maximize the distance\nbetween the training sample set and the hyperplane, thus the\nprimal optimization problem can be expressed as:\n\n\n\nmin ϕ(ω) =1\n2 ∥ω∥2\ns.t. |ω ·xi +b −yi|≤ε, i =1,2,···, N\n(3)\nBy introducing the lagrangian multipliers αi and α∗\ni ,\nthe dual problem of ε-SVR can be deduced as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmax W (α,α∗) =1\n2\nN∑\ni=1\n(\nαi −α∗\ni\n)(\nαj −α∗\nj\n)\nK(xi ·xj)\n+\nN∑\ni=1\n(\nαi −α∗\ni\n)\nyi −\nN∑\ni=1\n(\nαi +α∗\ni\n)\nε\ns.t.\nN∑\ni=1\n(\nαi −α∗\ni\n)\n=0, 0≤αi,α∗\ni ≤C, i=1,2,···, N\n(4)\nwhere C is the penalty coefﬁcient, K(xi, xj) =ϕ(xi)Tϕ(xj) is\nthe kernel function.\nThe radial basis function (RBF) kernel function is selected\nin this paper, it can be expressed as:\nK(xi,xj ) =exp(−γ\nxi −xj\n\n2), γ > 0 (5)\nwhere γ is the kernel function parameter.\nBy solving the above equations, the expression of the\noptimal hyperplane of the corresponding training sample set\nis:\nf (x) =\nN∑\ni=1\n(\nαi −α∗\ni\n)\nK(xi,x) +b (6)\nThe LIBSVM toolbox in MATLAB which is developed by\nDr. Chih-Jen Lin in National Taiwan University can be used\nto solve the dual problem of SVR model, thus the LIBSVM\ntoolbox is used to solve the regression problem in this paper\n[24].\n2) PARAMETERS OPTIMIZATION METHOD\nThrough the analysis of SVR model with RBF kernel, we can\nsee that penalty coefﬁcient C and kernel function parameter\nγ determine the model generalization ability. In this paper,\nK-fold cross-validation training method and grid search (GS)\nparameters optimization method are used to ﬁnd the optimal\nparameters of the SVR model.\nAs for the K-fold cross-validation training method, the\noriginal training data is divided into K groups, among which\nK-1 groups are used as training samples and the remain-\ning one group is used as the test sample for each training,\nthe whole training process repeats K times. The average value\nof the mean square error (MSE) for the K trials was taken as\nthe performance indicator of the SVR model [25].\nIn every training session, the grid search (GS) method is\nused to ﬁnd the optimal parameters of C and γ. The basic\nprinciple of grid search method is to divide the search ranges\nof C and γ into equidistant grids by a certain step size, and\ntraverse all of data points in the grids to obtain the optimal\nvalues of C and γ. Speciﬁcally, a grid with 2 dimensions\nis formed as follows, ([C 1,C2 ... Cn],[γ1,γ2 ...γ m]), among\nthem, n, m is the number of the penalty coefﬁcient C and ker-\nnel function parameter γ, it will form a data set combination\nconsisting of n×m data. Each (C , γ) combination in the data\nVOLUME 9, 2021 7753\nJ. Ruanet al.: Inversion Detection of Transformer Transient HST\nFIGURE 3. Step function for characterizing load change trend.\nset is trained, and the combination with the highest accuracy\nwill be the optimal parameter of the inversion model.\nC. SELECTION OF INVERSION FEATURE QUANTITY\nWhen the load of transformer starts to increase gradually\nfrom no-load, due to the existence of heat capacity of trans-\nformer oil, it takes a certain time for the heat generated by\nthe transformer winding to transfer to the iron shell, that\nis, the temperature of transformer iron shell temperature\nmeasuring point always reﬂects the temperature of winding\nat the previous moment. When the temperature rise of the\ntransformer tends to be stable, the heat capacity will no longer\nwork, and the temperature of the iron shell measurement\npoint and winding will not change. Therefore, how to put\nforward the feature quantity which can reﬂect the time lag\nrelationship between the iron shell temperature measurement\npoint and the winding is the key to the transformer transient\nHST inversion. For this reason, in addition to the real-time\nload rate, the following three feature quantities which can\nreﬂect the load change are proposed.\n1) LOAD SHIFT FACTOR\nA step function is used to represent the load change trend,\nas shown in Fig. 3. When the load rate increases, the input\nsignal is set to ‘‘1’’. If the load remains the same, signal ‘‘1’’\nstays; When the load rate is reduced, the input signal is set\nto ‘‘-1’’, if the load remains the same, the signal ‘‘-1’’ stays.\nThe load current of the transformer is continuously monitored\nduring the test, considering the ﬂuctuation of current, when\nthe effective value of current exceeds 1%, the load is consid-\nered to have changed\n2) LOAD DURATION\nIn order to reﬂect the duration of the load at a certain value,\nwe established the characteristic function of ‘load duration’,\nwhich is shown in Fig. 4. In detail, from the initial time,\nwhen the load is constant, the timing of the load duration will\ncontinue, when the transformer load rate changes, the timing\nwill restart from the moment of load rate change.\n3) LOAD RATE AT THE PREVIOUS ACQUISITION TIME\nIt takes a certain time for the heat to transfer from the\ntransformer winding to the iron shell, which makes the shell\ntemperature at this time always reﬂect the HST at the previous\nFIGURE 4. Characteristic function of load duration.\nTABLE 2. Locations of temperature measuring points on the iron shell.\nFIGURE 5. Temperature measuring points on the iron shell.\nmoment. Therefore, in order to better build the mapping\nmodel between the HST and the transformer iron shell tem-\nperature, the load rate of the previous acquisition time is\nadded to the transient inversion as the feature quantity, and\nthe sampling interval in the inversion is 15 minutes.\nIn addition to the above three transient feature quantities,\nthe transformer real time load rate, and 9 temperature measur-\ning points on the iron shell were also selected as the features\nof the SVR model. Based on the maximum minimum method\n[26], all the features are normalized within the range [0, 1].\nThe speciﬁc locations of the 9 temperature measuring points\non the iron shell are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 5.\nIII. TRANSFORMER TEMPERATURE RISE TEST\nThe oil immersed S13-M-100 kV A/10 kV distribution trans-\nformer is selected as the test object, and the transformer\ntemperature rise test under different load conditions and wind\nspeeds is carried out.\nA. TEMPERATURE RISE TEST METHOD\nBefore the temperature rise test, the transformer no-load and\nload tests under rated rate are carried out to obtain the trans-\nformer total loss under rated condition. The transformer rated\n7754 VOLUME 9, 2021\nJ. Ruanet al.: Inversion Detection of Transformer Transient HST\nFIGURE 6. Wiring diagram of short circuit temperature rise test.\nFIGURE 7. Fluorescent fiber optic temperature sensor.\nno-load loss Pw and load loss Pl is 149.2 W and 1517.3 W\nrespectively. The transformer temperature rise test is con-\nducted with the short circuit method recommended in IEC\n60076-2 [27], and the speciﬁc test wiring diagram is shown\nin Fig. 6.\nThe equation for calculating transformer losses under dif-\nferent load rate Pn is as follows:\nPn =n2 ×Pl +Pw (7)\nwhere n is the transformer load rate; Pl is the load loss at rated\nload rate; Pw is the no-load loss at rated load rate.\nDuring the test, two ﬂuorescent optical ﬁber temperature\nsensors are installed at the active parts that are expected to\nbe the hottest points of the transformer windings to measure\nthe transformer HST, which are respectively arranged at 95%\nheight of phase B high and low voltage winding oil channel,\nand the highest temperature of the optical ﬁber is taken as\nthe transformer HST. The structure diagram of ﬂuorescent\noptical ﬁber temperature sensor is shown in Fig. 7, and the\nspeciﬁc layout of optical ﬁber temperature sensors in the\nwinding are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9.\nThe temperature of the iron shell is very important for the\ninversion of the transformer HST. In the test, PT100 ther-\nmal resistance temperature sensors are used to monitor the\ntemperature of the iron shell. According to the iron shell\ntemperature measurement point positions which are speci-\nﬁed on Table 2, nine temperature measurement points are\narranged on the typical point on the transformer iron shell,\nand Fig. 10 shows the actual arrangement of the thermal\nresistance temperature sensors.\nAs shown in Fig. 11, in order to prevent the tempera-\nture measurement accuracy of thermal resistance from being\nFIGURE 8.

TEMPERATURE RISE TEST RESULTS\nIn this paper, four stages of transformer temperature rise\ntest are carried out, the ﬁrst stage and the second stage are\nsteady state temperature rise test, the load rate of each steady\nstate test remains unchanged, when the change rate of the\ntransformer HST is less than 1K/h and lasts for at least 3h,\nthe transformer load rate can be changed. The ﬁrst and second\nstage transformer winding HST are shown in Fig. 13 and\nFig. 14. In the ﬁrst stage, only the change of transformer\nload rate is considered, and in the second stage, the effect\nof wind speed is also considered. The third stage and the\nfourth stage are transformer transient temperature rise tests.\nIn the third stage, each load lasts for 2 hours, and the wind\nspeed changes with the load at the same time. In the fourth\nstage, each load lasts for 2 hours, and the wind speed in the\nenvironment changes every 1 hour. The third and fourth stage\ntransformer winding HST are shown in Fig. 15 and Fig. 16.\nIV. INVERSION OF TRANSFORMER TRANSIENT HOT SPOT\nTEMPERATURE\nA.

The speciﬁc training\nsamples and test samples are shown in Table 3 and Table 4.\nThe interval time of data sampling is set to 15 minutes,\nit is because that the data collected at the interval of 15 min-\nutes can reﬂect the change of temperature well and will not\ncause the situation of too much data. Therefore, 258 groups\nof training samples and 194 groups of test samples were\nobtained. Besides, it should be emphasized that in the applica-\ntion of this method in the actual transformer HST monitoring,\nthe appropriate sampling time should be changed according\nto the actual load.\nB.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, a set of feature temperature points on the trans-\nformer iron shell as well as other transient quantities which\ncan reﬂect the load change are proposed as feature quantities,\nbased on the SVR inversion model, the transient HST of\na 10 kV oil immersed distribution transformer is detected.\nThe maximum inversion temperature difference is 2.93 ◦C,\nand the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 1.66 %,\nthe inversion value of the transformer transient HST is in\ngood agreement with the measured one, and it outperform\nthe result obtained with GA-BPNN method. The inversion\nresults veriﬁed the feasibility of the real time inversion of oil\nimmersed transformer transient HST with SVR model.\nThe inversion method provides a new method for on-line\ndetection of transformer winding HST. In practical applica-\ntion, the transient HST of the transformer can be detected by\nmonitoring the transformer transient feature quantities, real\ntime load rate and the temperature of the measuring points on\nthe iron shell. The research results in this paper can provide\nreference for transformer load control.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H. Wang, M. Xue, T. Wang, Y . Hou, J. Chen, and J.
