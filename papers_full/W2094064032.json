Introduction\nPower transformers are the complex part of the power sys-\ntem. It is necessary to ensure the proper functioning of\ntransformer during operating conditions. Condition mon-\nitoring of transformer helps us to assess the remaining\nlife time of the power transformer. One of the monitoring\nmethodologies is to estimate the strength of the solid insu-\nlation systems for thermal degradation of transformer oil.\nRui-Jin Liao et al. [1] presented an investigation method-\nology to analyze the aging mechanism of insulation paper\n∗E-mail: hvekarthik@gmail.com\nfor several weeks using Atomic force microscope, Scanning\nelectron microscope and X-Ray diﬀraction techniques. Ji-\naming Yan et al. [2] observed the surface products of oil-\nimpregnated paper during damage process caused by par-\ntial discharge. T. S. R. Murthy et al. [3] analyzed the\ndegree of polymerization for cellulose paper by furan con-\ntent in the oil using HPLC. P. Verma et al. [4] analyzed\ndegradation of transformer insulation paper by Scanning\nelectron microscope and X-Ray diﬀraction techniques for\nvarious temperatures like 120–160 ◦C. Taro Hino et al.[5]\nanalyzed the detoriation of the oil-immersed papers by\nthe presence of CO, CO 2 and H 2O with the help of gas\nchromotograph techniques. Jiaming Yan et al. [6] exam-\nined the partial discharge pattern on insulation paper us-\ning SEM, IR spectrum and X- ray photo electric eﬀect.\n226\n\nR. Karthik, T. Sree Renga Raja, T. Sudhakar\nShi-qang et al. [7] presented an accelerated thermal ag-\ning test on oil immersed pressboard for 120, 250 and 400\nhours. They interpreted the Degree of polymerization and\nstructure through SEM images. In this paper an eﬀort has\nbeen made to investigate the degradation of solid insula-\ntion (Kraft paper – 20 hours, Press board – 100 hours) for\nthermal degradation of transformer oil. The main reason\nfor aging of solid insulation [8, 9\n] in power transformer\nis inﬂuenced by thermal, electromechanical & chemical\nstresses produced due to over loaded operating conditions.\nAmong these thermal stress leads to the major degradation\nprocess of oil and there by detoriation of paper insulation.\nSo the brittleness and durability of the insulation paper is\nreduced. As a result the expected life of the transformer is\nreduced. Aging of liquid dielectrics is analyzed by break-\ndown voltage, acidity, ﬂash point, dielectric dissipation\nfactor and interfacial tension. Gases dissolved [10] in the\noil are monitored with the help of diagnostic techniques\nlike Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA). The ageing of insula-\ntion paper is analyzed with the degree of polymerization,\nfuran content analysis and tensile strength [11–13] etc. In\norder to exactly determine aging degree of solid insulation\nsuitable techniques like Optical microscope, Atomic force\nmicroscope, Scanning electron microscope, Nuclear mag-\nnetic resonance, X-ray diﬀraction technique and Fourier\ntransform-Infrared spectroscopy [14] methods are used.\nFrom the above techniques Atomic force microscope, Scan-\nning electron microscope and X-ray diﬀraction techniques\nare used in this work to determine the aging degree of\nKraft paper and pressboard immersed in mineral oil.\n2. Description of the Method\nA synthetic based mineral oil with the density of\n0.89 g/cm 3 at 29 ◦C, Max. and water content of 15 ppm\nwas used in this test. The Kraft paper and pressboard\nmade of cellulose ﬁber content was used for accelerated\nthermal aging test. The Kraft paper and pressboard sat-\nisﬁes IEC 60641-2 standard. The test samples were cut\nto the dimension of 120 mm x 80 mm and the thickness of\nthe samples were about 0.5 mm for Kraft paper and 1 mm\nfor the pressboard which is shown in Figure 1\n. The ar-\nrangement of solid dielectrics, mineral oil and outlet valve\nof the test chamber is shown in Figure 2\n.\nInitially the test samples were dried to reduce their mois-\nture content. The whole assembly of the test sample is\nimmersed with the mineral oil in the test cell and tempera-\nture of the test cell in maintained at 90 ◦C. The Kraft paper\nand pressboard are heated up to 20 hours and 100 hours\nrespectively. Aging degree of Kraft paper and pressboard\nis analyzed using AFM, SEM and X-RD Techniques.\n(a)\n (b)\n(c)\n (d)\nFigure 1.

Results and Discussion\n3.1. AFM analysis\nAFM instrument [15] was used to analyze the surface\nof the samples. The AFM studies were conducted by\nusing Park systems Korea model XE70. The scanning\nprobe modes which scan across surface of the test samples\nand a repulsive force between the tip and the samples is\nrecorded relative to spatial variations and then converted\ninto analogue images which are shown below.\nThe Figure 3 shows surface image of the unaged Kraft pa-\nper. The scanning probe range is about 5 µm x 5 µm. The\ncolored surface image of the AFM provides the changes in\nthe surface that is from brown to white indicate the lowest\nto the highest position. The meshed structure of cellulose\nﬁbers were in regular order.\nThe Figure 4 shows the cropped image of the unaged Kraft\npaper. The meshed structure of cellulose ﬁbers were in\n227\nDeterioration of solid insulation for thermal degradation of transformer oil\nFigure 3. Image of New Kraft Paper Surface of AFM\nthe range of 300 x 300 nm. The meshed structure of the\ncellulose ﬁbers were viewed clearly and found no changes\nin the structure. The value of the molecular units in the\nunaged Kraft paper is 0–100 nm.\nFigure 4. Typical Cropped Image of New Kraft Paper of AFM\nThe Figure 5 shows the surface images of the mineral oil\naged Kraft paper for 20 hours. The meshed structures of\ncellulose ﬁbers were disordered.\nThe Figure 6 shows the enlarged AFM image of the min-\neral oil aged Kraft paper for 20 hours. The meshed struc-\nture of the cellulose ﬁbers were viewed clearly and found\ndrastic changes in the structure. The value of molecular\nunits in the mineral oil aged Kraft paper is reduced to\n0–10 nm range.\nFrom this we can infer that surface of Kraft paper is highly\ndetoriated with thermal degradation of mineral oil and\nﬁnally leading to decrease of insulation strength of the\nKraft paper.\nThe Figure 7 shows surface images of the unaged press-\nboard. The scanning probe range is about 5 µm x 5µm. The\nFigure 5.Image of Mineral Oil Aged Kraft Paper at 90◦C for 20 Hours\nFigure 6. Cropped Image of Mineral Oil aged Kraft Paper at 90 ◦C\nfor 20 Hours\ncolored surface image of the AFM provides the changes in\nthe surface that is from brown to white indicate the lowest\nto the highest position. The meshed structure of cellulose\nﬁbers were in regular order.\nFigure 7. Image of New Pressboard\n228\nR. Karthik, T. Sree Renga Raja, T. Sudhakar\nThe Figure 8 shows the enlarged image of the unaged\npressboard. The meshed structure of the cellulose ﬁbers\nwere viewed clearly and found no changes in the structure.\nThe value of the molecular units in the unaged pressboard\nis 0–200 nm range.\nFigure 8. Cropped Image of New Pressboard\nThe Figure 9 shows the surface AFM images of the mineral\noil aged pressboard for 100 hours. The meshed structure\nof cellulose ﬁbers were in disordered form.\nFigure 9. Image of Mineral Oil Aged Pressboard at 90 ◦C for 100\nHours\nThe Figure 10 shows the enlarged image of the mineral oil\naged pressboard for 100 hours. The meshed structure of\nthe cellulose ﬁbers were viewed clearly and found drastic\nchanges in the structure. The value of molecular units in\nthe mineral oil aged pressboard is reduced to 10–30 nm\nrange.\nFrom this we shall infer that surface of pressboard is\nhighly detoriated with thermal degradation of mineral oil\nand leads to decrease of insulation strength of the press-\nboard.\nFigure 10. Cropped Image of Mineral Oil aged Pressboard of AFM\n3.2. Structural analysis with SEM\nScanning electron microscope was used in order to study\nthe micro structural analysis of the aged Kraft paper and\npressboard samples. The SEM studies were conducted by\nusing HITACHI model S-3000H.\nFigure 11. Typical SEM image of New Kraft Paper\nThe Figure 10 shows the SEM image of fresh Kraft pa-\nper at x200 magniﬁcations. The SEM image indicates\nthat cellulose ﬁbers are tied together and closely packed.\nIt is found that average width of the cellulose ﬁbers is\n19.59 mm. The SEM image indicates that the cellulose\nﬁbers form the chain structures and no bond breaking in\nstructure.\n229\nDeterioration of solid insulation for thermal degradation of transformer oil\nFigure 12. SEM image of Mineral Oil aged Kraft Paper for 20 Hours\nThe Figure 12 shows the SEM image of mineral oil aged\nKraft paper for 20 hours with x200 magniﬁcations. The\nimage indicates the cellulose ﬁbers are found lack in order\nof arrangement. The sides of the walls in the structure of\nthe cellulose ﬁbers are destroyed. The average width of\nthe cellulose ﬁbers is decreased to 19.35 mm.\nFigure 13. SEM image of New Pressboard\nThe Figure 13 shows the SEM microscope of fresh press-\nboard at x200 magniﬁcations. The SEM image indicates\nthe cellulose ﬁbers are tied together and closely packed.\nThe average width of the cellulose ﬁbers is 19.05 mm.\nThe micrograph indicates that the cellulose ﬁbers form\nthe chain structures and no bond breaking in them.\nFigure 14. Typical SEM Micrograph of Mineral Oil aged Pressboard\nThe Figure 14 shows the SEM images of mineral oil aged\npressboard with x200 magniﬁcations. The image indicates\nthe cellulose ﬁbers are found lack in order of arrangement.\nThe sides of the walls in the structure of the cellulose\nﬁbers are destroyed. The average width of the cellulose\nﬁbers is decreased to 15.65 mm. The image indicates\nthat the chain structures of the cellulose ﬁbers destroyed\nseverely and leading to the rupturing of the pressboard.\n3.3. X-RAY diﬀraction method\nX-ray diﬀraction technique is an analytical technique used\nfor identiﬁcation of crystalline material. The X-rays of\nknown wavelength are passed through the sample to iden-\ntify the crystal structure. The X ray diﬀraction studies\nwere conducted by using Panalytical model ’X’ per PRO.\nThe wave nature is diﬀracted by crystal to give unique\npattern of peaks of ’reﬂections’ at diﬀering angles and of\ndiﬀering intensity. The X-ray detector moves around the\nsample and measures the intensity of these peaks and\npositions of these peaks.\nThe structure and number of atoms present in the structure\nare the deciding factors of the crystalline material of the\ntest samples. Relative intensity of the material is analyzed\nwith help of the ordered peak (sharp) and disordered peak\n(smooth). In addition to the relative intensity the mean\n230\nR. Karthik, T. Sree Renga Raja, T. Sudhakar\nsize of the crystalline domains can cause changes in the\ncrystalline material of the test samples and it is calculated\nwith the Scherer formula [1]. Figure 14 shows diﬀraction\npattern of the unaged Kraft paper. The relative intensity of\nthe unaged sample was 35.04%. The size of the crystalline\ndomains is 3.084 Å.\nFigure 15. XRD pattern of New Kraft Paper\nThe Figure 16 shows diﬀraction pattern of the mineral oil\naged Kraft paper for 20 hours. The relative intensity of the\nmineral oil aged paper was 14.65% and the mean size of\nthe crystalline domains is 1.518 Å. Hence from the above\nresult it is proved that the intensity of the Kraft paper is\nreducing with time.\nFigure 16. XRD pattern of Mineral Oil Aged Kraft Paper at 90◦C for\n20 Hours\nThe Figure 17 shows the diﬀraction pattern of the unaged\npressboard. The relative intensity of the unaged sample\nwas 23.44%. The size of the crystalline domains is 2.161 Å.\nThe Figure 18 shows diﬀraction pattern of the mineral oil\naged pressboard for 100 hours. The relative intensity of\nFigure 17. XRD pattern of New Pressboard\nthe mineral oil aged paper was 10.54% and the mean size\nof the crystalline domains is 1.994 Å.\nFigure 18. XRD pattern of Mineral Oil aged pressboard at 90◦C for\n100 Hours\nHence from the above obtained results it is conferred that\nthe relative intensity of the pressboard is reducing with\nincrease in time. The Table 1 compares the test results\nin all types of techniques and it is found that the surface\ndegrades for increase in hours of ageing.\n4. Conclusions\nOne of the critical parameter which determines the life of\npower transformer is strength of solid insulation. Insula-\ntion strength of Kraft paper and pressboard is mainly de-\ntermined by thermal degradation of transformer oil. Deto-\nriation level of solid insulation systems is examined using\nAFM, SEM and XRD Techniques. Exact monitoring of\nsolid insulation systems surely paves way for optimized\nperformance of power transformers.\n231\nDeterioration of solid insulation for thermal degradation of transformer oil\nTable 1.Comparison of results of test samples\nS.No. Description of samples AFM analysis SEM analysis XRD analysis\nValue of molecular units Average width of ﬁbers Relative intensity (%)\n1 Un aged Kraft paper 0–100 nm 19.59 nm 35.04\n2 Aged Kraft paper for 20 hours 0–10 nm 19.35 nm 14.65\n3 Un aged Pressboard 0–200 nm 19.05 nm 23.44\n4 Aged Pressboard for 100 hours 10–30 nm 15.65 nm 10.54\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors like to thank Department of Science and\nTechnology (DST), Ministry of Science and Technology,\nGovernment of India for funding the project to carry out re-\nsearch work on ’Investigations of critical electrical charac-\nteristics and UV response of transformer oil for optimized\nfunctions of Power transformer’ under Fast track Young\nScientists Scheme.
