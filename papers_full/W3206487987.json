These models\nare typically trained on large amounts of text, orig-\ninating from unmoderated sources, such as the in-\nternet. While the performance of these pre-trained\nmodels is remarkable, recent work has shown that\nthey capture social biases from the data they are\ntrained on (May et al. 2019; Kurita et al. 2019;\nWebster et al. 2020; Nangia et al. 2020; Nadeem\n1Our code is publicly available: https://github.\ncom/mcgill-nlp/bias-bench.\net al. 2021, inter alia). Because of these ﬁndings,\nan increasing amount of research has focused on de-\nveloping techniques to mitigate these biases (Liang\net al., 2020; Ravfogel et al., 2020; Webster et al.,\n2020; Kaneko and Bollegala, 2021; Schick et al.,\n2021; Lauscher et al., 2021). However, the pro-\nposed techniques are often not investigated thor-\noughly. For instance, much work focuses only on\nmitigating gender bias despite pre-trained language\nmodels being plagued by other social biases (e.g.,\nracial or religious bias). Additionally, the impact\nthat debiasing has on both downstream task per-\nformance, as well as language modeling ability, is\noften not well explored.\nIn this paper, we perform an empirical survey of\nthe effectiveness of ﬁve recently proposed debias-\ning techniques for pre-trained language models:2\nCounterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA; Zmi-\ngrod et al. 2019; Webster et al. 2020), Dropout\n(Webster et al., 2020), Iterative Nullspace Projec-\ntion (INLP; Ravfogel et al. 2020), Self-Debias\n(Schick et al., 2021), and SentenceDebias (Liang\net al., 2020). Following the taxonomy described by\nBlodgett et al. (2020), our work studies the effec-\ntiveness of these techniques in mitigating represen-\ntational biases from pre-trained language models.\nMore speciﬁcally, we investigate mitigating gen-\nder, racial, and religious biases in three masked\nlanguage models (BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa)\nand an autoregressive language model (GPT-2). We\nalso explore how debiasing impacts a model’s lan-\nguage modeling ability, as well as a model’s per-\nformance on downstream natural language under-\nstanding (NLU) tasks.\nConcretely, our paper aims to answer the follow-\ning research questions:\nQ1 Which technique is most effective in mitigat-\ning bias?\n2We select these techniques based upon popularity, ease of\nimplementation, and ease of adaptation to non-gender biases.\n1878\nQ2 Do these techniques worsen a model’s lan-\nguage modeling ability?\nQ3 Do these techniques worsen a model’s ability\nto perform downstream NLU tasks?\nTo answer Q1 (§4), we evaluate debiased\nmodels against three intrinsic bias benchmarks:\nthe Sentence Encoder Association Test (SEAT;\nMay et al. 2019), StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021),\nand Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs (CrowS-\nPairs; Nangia et al. 2020). Generally, we found\nSelf-Debias to be the strongest bias mitigation tech-\nnique. To answer Q2 (§5) and Q3 (§6), we evaluate\ndebiased models against WikiText-2 (Merity et al.,\n2017) and the General Language Understanding\nEvaluation (GLUE; Wang and Cho 2019) bench-\nmark. We found debiasing tends to worsen a\nmodel’s language modeling ability. However, our\nresults suggest that debiasing has little impact on a\nmodel’s ability to perform downstream NLU tasks.\n2 Techniques for Measuring Bias\nWe begin by describing the three intrinsic bias\nbenchmarks we use to evaluate our debiasing\ntechniques. We select these benchmarks as they\ncan be used to measure not only gender bias, but\nalso racial and religious bias in language models.\nSentence Encoder Association Test (SEAT).\nWe use SEAT (May et al., 2019) as our ﬁrst in-\ntrinsic bias benchmark. SEAT is an extension of\nthe Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT;\nCaliskan et al. 2017) to sentence-level representa-\ntions. Below, we ﬁrst describe WEAT.\nWEAT makes use of four sets of words: two\nsets of bias attribute words and two sets of target\nwords. The attribute word sets characterize a\ntype of bias. For example, the attribute word sets\n{man, he, him, ... } and {woman, she, her, ... }\ncould be used for gender bias. The target word\nsets characterize particular concepts. For example,\nthe target word sets {family, child, parent, ... }\nand {work, ofﬁce, profession, ... }could be used\nto characterize the concepts of family and career,\nrespectively. WEAT evaluates whether the repre-\nsentations for words from one particular attribute\nword set tend to be more closely associated with\nthe representations for words from one particular\ntarget word set. For instance, if the representations\nfor the female attribute words listed above tended\nto be more closely associated with the represen-\ntations for the family target words, this may be\nindicative of bias within the word representations.\nFormally, letAand Bdenote the sets of attribute\nwords and let X and Y denote the sets of target\nwords. The SEAT test statistic is\ns(X,Y,A,B ) =\n∑\nx∈X\ns(x,A,B ) −\n∑\ny∈Y\ns(y,A,B )\nwhere for a particular word w, s(w,A,B ) is de-\nﬁned as the difference between w’s mean cosine\nsimilarity with the words from A and w’s mean\ncosine similarity with the words from B\ns(w,A,B )= 1\n|A|\n∑\na∈A\ncos(w,a)− 1\n|B|\n∑\nb∈B\ncos(w,b).\nThey report an effect size given by\nd= µ({s(x,A,B )}x∈X) −µ({s(y,A,B )}y∈Y )\nσ({s(t,X,Y )}t∈A∪B)\nwhere µ denotes the mean and σ denotes the\nstandard deviation. Here, an effect size closer to\nzero is indicative of a smaller degree of bias in the\nrepresentations.\nTo create a sentence-level version of WEAT (re-\nferred to as SEAT), May et al. (2019) substitute\nthe attribute words and target words from WEAT\ninto synthetic sentence templates (e.g., “ this is a\n[WORD]”) to create a collection of sentences. Now,\ngiven sets of sentences containing attribute and tar-\nget words, the WEAT test statistic can be computed\nusing sentence-level representations obtained from\na pre-trained language model.3\nWe refer readers to Appendix A for a list of the\nSEAT tests we use to measure each type of bias in\nour work. We report the effect size for each SEAT\ntest we evaluate.\nStereoSet. As our second intrinsic bias bench-\nmark, we use StereoSet (Nadeem et al., 2021), a\ncrowdsourced dataset for measuring four types\nof stereotypical bias in language models. Each\nStereoSet example consists of a context sentence,\nfor example “our housekeeper is [MASK] ”, and\na set of three candidate associations (completions)\nfor that sentence—one being stereotypical,\nanother being anti-stereotypical, and a third being\n3We use a permutation on the SEAT test statistic to com-\npute the signiﬁcance of association between the attribute word\nsets and the target word sets. We refer readers to the original\nwork of Caliskan et al. (2017) for a complete description of\nthis test.\n1879\nunrelated.4 Using the example above, a stereo-\ntypical association might be “ our housekeeper\nis Mexican ”, an anti-stereotypical association\nmight be “our housekeeper is American”, and an\nunrelated association might be “our housekeeper\nis computer”. To quantify how biased a language\nmodel is, we score the stereotypical association\nand the anti-stereotypical association for each\nexample under a model. We then compute the\npercentage of examples for which a model prefers\nthe stereotypical association as opposed to the\nanti-stereotypical association. We deﬁne this\npercentage as the stereotype score of a model.\nStereoSet also provides a measure of a model’s\nlanguage modeling ability. For each example in\nthe dataset, we also score the unrelated association.\nWe then measure the percentage of examples\nfor which a model prefers a meaningful associ-\nation (either the stereotypical association or the\nanti-stereotypical association) as opposed to the\nunrelated association. We deﬁne this percentage\nas the language modeling score of a model.\nWe evaluate our debiased models against the\nStereoSet test set. We evaluate debiased models\nfor each domain against their respective StereoSet\ntest set split (e.g., gender debiased models are\nevaluated against the gender bias examples).\nCrowdsourced Stereotype Pairs (CrowS-Pairs).\nWe use CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020) as our\nthird intrinsic bias benchmark. CrowS-Pairs is\na crowdsourced dataset that consists of pairs of\nminimally distant sentences—that is, sentences\nthat differ only with respect to a small number of\ntokens. The ﬁrst sentence in each pair reﬂects a\nstereotype about a historically disadvantaged group\nin the United States. For example, the sentence\n“people who live in trailers are alcoholics” reﬂects\na possible socioeconomic stereotype. The second\nsentence in each pair then violates the stereotype\nintroduced in the ﬁrst sentence. For example,\nthe sentence “ people who live in mansions\nare alcoholics ” violates, or in a sense, is the\nanti-stereotypical version of the ﬁrst sentence.\nWe quantify how biased a language model is\nby measuring how frequently a model prefers\nthe stereotypical sentence in each pair over the\nanti-stereotypical sentence. Nangia et al. (2020)\noriginally proposed using pseudo-likelihood-based\n4We consider only the intrasentence task from StereoSet.\nHenceforth, when we refer to a StereoSet example, we are\nreferring to a StereoSet intrasentence example.\nscoring (Salazar et al., 2020) for CrowS-Pairs,\nhowever, recent work has suggested that pseudo-\nlikelihood-based scoring may be subject to model\ncalibration issues (Desai and Durrett, 2020; Jiang\net al., 2020). Thus, we score each pair of sentences\nusing masked token probabilities in a similar\nfashion to StereoSet. For each pair of sentences,\nwe score the stereotypical sentence by computing\nthe masked token probability of the tokens unique\nto the stereotypical sentence. In the example above,\nwe would compute the masked token probability of\ntrailers. We score each anti-stereotypical sentence\nin a similar fashion. If multiple tokens are unique\nto a given sentence, we compute the average\nmasked token probability by masking each differ-\ning token individually. We deﬁne the stereotype\nscore of a model to be the percentage of examples\nfor which a model assigns a higher masked\ntoken probability to the stereotypical sentence as\nopposed to the anti-stereotypical sentence.\n3 Debiasing Techniques\nBelow, we describe the ﬁve debiasing techniques\nwe evaluate in this work. We refer readers to\nAppendix C for additional experimental details on\neach debiasing technique.\nCounterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA).\nCDA (Zmigrod et al., 2019; Dinan et al., 2020a;\nWebster et al., 2020; Barikeri et al., 2021) is a data-\nbased debiasing strategy often used to mitigate\ngender bias. Roughly, CDA involves re-balancing\na corpus by swapping bias attribute words (e.g.,\nhe/she) in a dataset. For example, to help mitigate\ngender bias, the sentence “ the doctor went to\nthe room and he grabbed the syringe ” could be\naugmented to “the doctor went to the room and\nshe grabbed the syringe”. The re-balanced corpus\nis then often used for further training to debias\na model. While CDA has been mainly used for\ngender debiasing, we also evaluate its effectiveness\nfor other types of biases. For instance, we\ncreate CDA data for mitigating religious bias by\nswapping religious terms in a corpus, say church\nwith mosque, to generate counterfactual examples.\nWe experiment with debiasing pre-trained lan-\nguage models by performing an additional phase\nof pre-training on counterfactually augmented\nsentences from English Wikipedia.5\n5We list the bias attribute words we make use of in our\nstudy in Appendix B.\n1880\nDROPOUT . Webster et al. (2020) investigate\nusing dropout regularization (Srivastava et al.,\n2014) as a bias mitigation technique. They\ninvestigate increasing the dropout parameters\nfor BERT and ALBERT’s attention weights and\nhidden activations and performing an additional\nphase of pre-training. Experimentally, they ﬁnd\nincreased dropout regularization reduces gender\nbias within these models. They hypothesize that\ndropout’s interruption of the attention mechanisms\nwithin BERT and ALBERT help prevent them\nfrom learning undesirable associations between\nwords. We extend this study to other types of\nbiases. Similar to CDA, we perform an additional\nphase of pre-training on sentences from English\nWikipedia using increased dropout regularization.\nSELF -DEBIAS . Schick et al. (2021) propose\na post-hoc debiasing technique that leverages a\nmodel’s internal knowledge to discourage it from\ngenerating biased text.\nInformally, Schick et al. (2021) propose using\nhand-crafted prompts to ﬁrst encourage a model to\ngenerate toxic text. For example, generation from\nan autoregressive model could be prompted with\n“The following text discriminates against people\nbecause of their gender.” Then, a second continu-\nation that is non-discriminative can be generated\nfrom the model where the probabilities of tokens\ndeemed likely under the ﬁrst toxic generation are\nscaled down.\nImportantly, since Self-Debias is a post-hoc\ntext generation debiasing procedure, it does not\nalter a model’s internal representations or its\nparameters. Thus, Self-Debias cannot be used as a\nbias mitigation strategy for downstream NLU tasks\n(e.g., GLUE). Additionally, since SEAT measures\nbias in a model’s representations and Self-Debias\ndoes not alter a model’s internal representations,\nwe cannot evaluate Self-Debias against SEAT.\nSENTENCE DEBIAS . Liang et al. (2020) extend\nHard-Debias, a word embedding debiasing\ntechnique proposed by Bolukbasi et al. (2016)\nto sentence representations. SentenceDebias is a\nprojection-based debiasing technique that requires\nthe estimation of a linear subspace for a particular\ntype of bias. Sentence representations can be\ndebiased by projecting onto the estimated bias\nsubspace and subtracting the resulting projection\nfrom the original sentence representation.\nLiang et al. (2020) use a three step procedure\nfor computing a bias subspace. First, they deﬁne\na list of bias attribute words (e.g., he/she). Second,\nthey contextualize the bias attribute words into\nsentences. This is done by ﬁnding occurences\nof the bias attribute words in sentences within a\ntext corpus. For each sentence found during this\ncontextualization step, CDA is applied to generate\na pair of sentences that differ only with respect to\nthe bias attribute word. Finally, they estimate the\nbias subspace. For each of the sentences obtained\nduring the contextualization step, a corresponding\nrepresentation can be obtained from a pre-trained\nmodel. Principle Component Analysis (PCA; Abdi\nand Williams 2010) is then used to estimate the\nprinciple directions of variation of the resulting set\nof representations. The ﬁrst K principle compo-\nnents can be taken to deﬁne the bias subspace.\nIterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). Ravfo-\ngel et al. (2020) propose INLP, a projection-based\ndebiasing technique similar to SentenceDebias.\nRoughly, INLP debiases a model’s representations\nby training a linear classiﬁer to predict the pro-\ntected property you want to remove (e.g., gender)\nfrom the representations. Then, representations\ncan be debiased by projecting them into the\nnullspace of the learnt classiﬁer’s weight matrix,\neffectively removing all of the information the\nclassiﬁer used to predict the protected attribute\nfrom the representation. This process can then be\napplied iteratively to debias the representation.\nIn our experiments, we create a classiﬁcation\ndataset for INLP by ﬁnding occurrences of bias\nattribute words (e.g., he/she) in English Wikipedia.\nFor example, for gender bias, we classify each\nsentence from English Wikipedia into one of\nthree classes depending upon whether a sentence\ncontains a male word, a female word, or no\ngendered words.\n4 Which Technique is Most Effective in\nMitigating Bias?\nTo investigate which technique is most effective in\nmitigating bias (Q1), we evaluate debiased BERT,\nALBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 models against\nSEAT, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs. We present\nBERT and GPT-2 results in the main paper and\ndefer readers to Appendix E for results for the other\nmodels. We use the base uncased BERT model and\nthe small GPT-2 model in our experiments.\n1881\nModel SEAT-6 SEAT-6b SEAT-7 SEAT-7b SEAT-8 SEAT-8b Avg.

In Table 1, we report results\nfor gender debiased BERT and GPT-2 models on\nSEAT.\nFor BERT, we ﬁnd two of our four debiased\nmodels obtain lower average absolute effect sizes\nthan the baseline model. In particular, INLP per-\nforms best on average across all six SEAT tests.\nNotably, INLP and SentenceDebias both obtain\nlower average absolute effect sizes than the base-\nline model while the CDA and Dropout models\ndo not. Intuitively, this may be due to INLP and\nSentenceDebias taking a more aggressive approach\nto debiasing by attempting to remove all gender\ninformation from a model’s representations.\nFor GPT-2, our results are less encouraging.\nWe ﬁnd all of the debiased models obtain higher\naverage absolute effect sizes than the baseline\nmodel. However, we note that SEAT fails to detect\nany statistically signiﬁcant bias in the baseline\nmodel in any of the six SEAT tests to begin with.\nWe argue, alongside others (Kurita et al., 2019;\nMay et al., 2019), that SEAT’s failure to detect\nbias in GPT-2 brings into question its reliability\nas a bias benchmark. For our gender debiased\nALBERT and RoBERTa models, we observed\nsimilar trends in performance to BERT.\nWe also use SEAT to evaluate racial and reli-\ngious bias in our models. In Table 2, we report\naverage absolute effect sizes for race and religion\ndebiased BERT and GPT-2 models. We ﬁnd most\nof our race and religion debiased BERT and GPT-2\nmodels obtain lower average absolute effect sizes\nthan their respective baseline models.

In Table 3, we report Stere-\noSet results for BERT and GPT-2.\nFor BERT, four of the ﬁve gender debiased\nmodels obtain lower stereotype scores than the\nbaseline model. However, the race debiased\nmodels do not perform as consistently well. We\nnote that for race, only two of the ﬁve debiased\nmodels obtain lower stereotype scores than the\nbaseline model. Encouragingly, we ﬁnd four of the\nﬁve religion debiased BERT models obtain reduced\nstereotype scores. We observed similar trends to\nBERT in our ALBERT and RoBERTa results.\nFor GPT-2, the gender debiased models do not\nperform as consistently well.

Results are on the StereoSet test\nset. A random model (which chooses the stereotypi-\ncal candidate and the anti-stereotypical candidate for\neach example with equal probability) obtains a stereo-\ntype score of 50% in expectation.\nthat the CDA model obtains a higher stereotype\nscore than the baseline model.\nOne encouraging trend in our results is the\nconsistently strong performance of Self-Debias.\nAcross all three bias domains, the Self-Debias\nBERT and GPT-2 models always obtain reduced\nstereotype scores. Similarly, ﬁve of the six Self-\nDebias ALBERT and RoBERTa models obtain re-\nduced stereotype scores. These results suggest that\nSelf-Debias is a reliable debiasing technique.\nCrowS-Pairs Results. In Table 4, we report\nCrowS-Pairs results for BERT and GPT-2. Similar\nto StereoSet, we observe that Self-Debias BERT,\nALBERT and RoBERTa, and GPT-2 models\nconsistently obtain improved stereotype scores\nacross all three bias domains.\nWe also observe a large degree of variability in\nthe performance of our debiasing techniques on\nCrowS-Pairs. For example, the GPT-2religion Sen-\ntenceDebias model obtains a stereotype score of\n35.24, an absolute difference of 27.62 points rela-\ntive to the baseline model’s score. We hypothesize\nthat this large degree of variability is due to the\nsmall size of CrowS-Pairs (it is ∼1\n4 th the size of\nthe StereoSet test set). In particular, there are only\n105 religion examples in the CrowS-Pairs dataset.\nFurthermore, Aribandi et al. (2021) demonstrated\nthe relative instability of the performance of pre-\ntrained language models, such as BERT, on CrowS-\nPairs (and StereoSet) across different pre-training\nruns. Thus, we caution readers from drawing too\nmany conclusions from StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs\nresults alone.\nDo SEAT, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs Reliably\nMeasure Bias? SEAT, StereoSet, and CrowS-\nPairs alone may not reliably measure bias in lan-\nguage models. To illustrate why this is the case,\nconsider a random language model being evaluated\nagainst StereoSet. It randomly selects either the\nstereotypical or anti-stereotypical association for\neach example. Thus, in expectation, this model ob-\ntains a perfect stereotype score of 50%, although it\nis a bad language model. This highlights that a de-\nbiased model may obtain reduced stereotype scores\nby just becoming a worse language model. Moti-\nvated by this discussion, we now investigate how\ndebiasing impacts language modeling performance.\n5 How Does Debiasing Impact Language\nModeling?\nTo investigate how debiasing impacts language\nmodeling (Q2), we measure perplexities before and\nafter debiasing each of our models on WikiText-2\n(Merity et al., 2017). We also compute StereoSet\nlanguage modeling scores for each of our debiased\nmodels. We discuss our ﬁndings below.\nWikiText-2 and StereoSet Results. Following\na similar setup to Schick et al.

A random model\n(which chooses the stereotypical sentence and anti-\nstereotypical sentence for each example with equal\nprobability) obtains a stereotype score of 50%.\nof WikiText-2 for our experiments. Since perplex-\nity is not well-deﬁned for masked language models,\nwe instead compute pseudo-perplexities (Salazar\net al., 2020) for BERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa.\nWe compute the perplexities of the GPT-2 models\nnormally. For StereoSet, we compute our language\nmodeling scores using the entire test set.\nIn Table 5, we report our results for gender de-\nbiased BERT and GPT-2 models.

We compute the StereoSet language modeling\nscores using all examples from the StereoSet test set.\nstrong correlation (negative) between a model’s per-\nplexity on WikiText-2 and its StereoSet language\nmodeling score. We observe most debiased models\nobtain higher perplexities and lower language\nmodeling scores than their respective baselines. No-\ntably, some debiasing techniques appear to signiﬁ-\ncantly degrade a model’s language modeling ability.\nFor instance, the SentenceDebias GPT-2 model\nobtains a perplexity of 65.493—twice as large as\nthe perplexity of the baseline GPT-2 model. How-\never, there are some exceptions to this trend. The\nCDA and Dropout BERT models both obtain lower\nperplexities than the baseline BERT model. We\nhypothesize that this may be due to the additional\ntraining on English Wikipedia these models had.\n6 How Does Debiasing Impact\nDownstream Task Performance?\nTo investigate how debiasing impacts performance\non downstream NLU tasks (Q3), we evaluate our\ngender debiased models against the GLUE bench-\nmark after ﬁne-tuning them. We report the results\nfor BERT and GPT-2 in Table 6. Encouragingly,\nthe performance of GPT-2 seems largely unaffected\nby debiasing. In some cases, we in fact observe\nincreased performance. For instance, the CDA,\nDropout, and INLP GPT-2 models obtain higher av-\nerage GLUE scores than the baseline model. With\nBERT, three of the four debiased models obtain\nslightly lower scores than the baseline model. Sim-\nilarly, most of the ALBERT and RoBERTa models\nare relatively unaffected by debiasing.\n1884\nModel Average\nBERT 77.74\n+ CDA ↓0.22 77.52\n+ DROPOUT ↓1.46 76.28\n+ INLP ↓0.99 76.76\n+ SENTENCE DEBIAS ↑0.07 77.81\nGPT-2 73.01\n+ CDA ↑1.20 74.21\n+ DROPOUT ↑0.15 73.16\n+ INLP ↑0.05 73.06\n+ SENTENCE DEBIAS ↓0.38 72.63\nTable 6: Average GLUE scores for gender debiased\nBERT and GPT-2 models.Results are reported on the\nGLUE validation set. We refer readers to Appendix E\nfor a complete set of results.\nWe hypothesize that the debiasing techniques\ndo not damage a model’s representations to such\na critical extent that our models’ are unable to per-\nform downstream tasks. The ﬁne-tuning step also\nhelps the models to relearn essential information to\nsolve a task even if a debiasing method removes it.\n7 Discussion and Limitations\nBelow, we discuss our ﬁndings for each research\nquestion we investigated in this work. We also\ndiscuss some of the limitations of our study.\nQ1: Which technique is most effective in mit-\nigating bias? We found Self-Debias to be the\nstrongest debiasing technique. Self-Debias not\nonly consistently reduced gender bias, but also ap-\npeared effective in mitigating racial and religious\nbias across all four studied pre-trained language\nmodels. Critically, Self-Debias also had minimal\nimpact on a model’s language modeling ability. We\nbelieve the development of debiasing techniques\nwhich leverage a model’s internal knowledge, like\nSelf-Debias, to be a promising direction for future\nresearch. Importantly, we want to be able to use\n“self-debiasing” methods when a model is being\nused for downstream tasks.\nQ2: Do these techniques worsen a model’s lan-\nguage modeling ability? In general, we found\nmost debiasing techniques tend to worsen a model’s\nlanguage modeling ability. This worsening in lan-\nguage modeling raises questions about if some de-\nbiasing techniques were actually effective in mit-\nigating bias. Furthermore, when you couple this\nwith the already noisy nature of the bias bench-\nmarks used in our work (Aribandi et al., 2021) it\nbecomes even more difﬁcult to determine which\nbias mitigation techniques are effective. Because\nof this, we believe reliably evaluating debiasing\ntechniques requires a rigorous evaluation of how\ndebiasing affects language modeling.\nQ3: Do these techniques worsen a model’s abil-\nity to perform downstream NLU tasks? We\nfound the debiasing techniques did not damage\na model’s ability to learn to perform downstream\nNLU tasks—a ﬁnding in alignment with other re-\ncent work (Barikeri et al., 2021). We conjecture this\nis because the ﬁne-tuning step helps the debiased\nmodels to learn and retain essential information to\nsolve a task.\nLimitations. We describe three of the main limi-\ntations of our work below.\n1) We only investigate bias mitigation tech-\nniques for language models trained on English.\nHowever, some of the techniques studied in our\nwork cannot easily be extended to other languages.\nFor instance, many of our debiasing techniques\ncannot be used to mitigate gender bias in languages\nwith grammatical gender (e.g., French).6\n2) Our work is skewed towardsNorth American\nsocial biases. StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs were\nboth crowdsourced using North American crowd-\nworkers, and thus, may only reﬂect North Ameri-\ncan social biases. We believe analysing the effec-\ntiveness of debiasing techniques cross-culturally to\nbe an important area for future research. Further-\nmore, all of the bias benchmarks used in this work\nhave only positive predictive power. For example, a\nperfect stereotype score of 50% on StereoSet does\nnot indicate that a model is unbiased.\n3) Many of our debiasing techniques make sim-\nplifying assumptions about bias. For example,\nfor gender bias, most of our debiasing techniques\nassume a binary deﬁnition of gender. While we\nfully recognize gender as non-binary, we evaluate\nexisting techniques in our work, and thus, follow\ntheir setup. Manzini et al. (2019) develop debiasing\ntechniques that use a non-binary deﬁnition of gen-\nder, but much remains to be explored. Moreover,\nwe only focus on representational biases among\nothers (Blodgett et al., 2020).\n8 Conclusion\nTo the best of our knowledge, we have performed\nthe ﬁrst large scale evaluation of multiple debiasing\n6See Zhou et al. (2019) for a complete discussion of gender\nbias in languages with grammatical gender.\n1885\ntechniques for pre-trained language models. We\ninvestigated the efﬁcacy of each debiasing tech-\nnique in mitigating gender, racial, and religious\nbias in four pre-trained language models: BERT,\nALBERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2. We used three\nintrinsic bias benchmarks to evaluate the effective-\nness of each debiasing technique in mitigating bias\nand also investigated how debiasing impacts lan-\nguage modeling and downstream NLU task perfor-\nmance. We hope our work helps to better direct\nfuture research in bias mitigation.\n9 Acknowledgements\nWe thank the members of SR’s research group\nfor helpful feedback throughout the duration of\nthis project.

While we fully recognize gender\nas non-binary, our survey closely follows the origi-\nnal methodology of the techniques explored in this\nwork. We believe it will be critical for future re-\nsearch in gender bias to use a more ﬂuid deﬁnition\nof gender and we are encouraged by early work in\nthis direction (Manzini et al., 2019; Dinan et al.,\n2020b). Similarly, our work makes use of a narrow\ndeﬁnition of religious and racial bias.\nWe also note we do not investigate theextrinsic\nharm caused by any of the studied pre-trained lan-\nguage models, nor any potential reduction in harm\nby making use of any of our studied debiasing\ntechniques. In other words, we do not investigate\nhow biases in pre-trained language models effect\nhumans in real-world settings.\nFinally, we highlight that all of the intrinsic bias\nbenchmarks used in this work have only positive\npredictive power. In other words, they can iden-\ntify models as biased, but cannot verify a model\nas unbiased. For example, a stereotype score of\n50% on StereoSet or CrowS-Pairs is not indica-\ntive of an unbiased model. Additionally, recent\nwork demonstrated the potential unreliability of the\nbias benchmarks used in this work (Blodgett et al.,\n2021). Because of this, we caution readers from\nmaking deﬁnitive claims about bias in pre-trained\nlanguage models based on these benchmarks alone.\nReferences\nHervé Abdi and Lynne J. Williams. 2010.

In Table 7, we list the Hugging Face\nmodel checkpoints we use for all of the experi-\nments in this work.\nModel Checkpoint\nBERT bert-base-uncased\nALBERT albert-base-v2\nRoBERTa roberta-base\nGPT-2 gpt2\nTable 7: Hugging Face model checkpoints we use for\nour experiments.\nWe discuss implementation details for each de-\nbiasing technique below.\nC.1 CDA\nWe use 10% of an English Wikipedia dump to train\nour CDA models. To generate our training corpus,\nwe apply two-sided CDA (Webster et al., 2020) us-\ning the bias attribute words provided in Appendix B.\nBERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa are trained using\na masked language modeling objective where we\nrandomly mask 15% of the tokens in each training\nsequence. GPT-2 is trained using a normal autore-\ngressive language modeling objective. We train all\nof our models for 2K steps using an effective batch\nsize of 512.\nC.2 Dropout\nWe use 10% of an English Wikipedia dump to train\nour Dropout models. In Table 8, we report the\ndropout parameters we use for debiasing BERT,\nALBERT, and RoBERTa. To debias GPT-2, we\nset resid_p_dropout, embd_dropout, and\nattn_dropout to 0.15. BERT, ALBERT, and\nRoBERTa are trained using a masked language\nmodeling objective where we randomly mask 15%\nof the tokens in each training sequence. GPT-2\nis trained using a normal autoregressive language\nmodeling objective. We train all of our models for\n2K steps using an effective batch size of 512.\nC.3 INLP\nWe make use of the implementation provided by\nRavfogel et al. (2020). 8 We use 2.5% of an En-\nglish Wikipedia dump to generate our training set\nfor INLP and we use the bias attribute provided\nin Appendix B. We randomly sample 10000 sen-\ntences containing words from each bias attribute\nclass to form our training set. We encode each sen-\ntence using a pre-trained language model. We take\nthe average token representation from the model’s\nlast hidden state (last_hidden_state) as the\nsentence representation. We train 80 classiﬁers for\nBERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa and10 classiﬁers\nfor GPT-2.9\nC.4 Self-Debias\nWe make use of the implementation provided by\nSchick et al. (2021).10 We provide the prompts we\nuse for debiasing in Table 9.\nC.5 SentenceDebias\nWe make use of the implementation provided\nby Liang et al. (2020). 11 We use 2.5% of an\nEnglish Wikipedia dump and the bias attribute\nwords provided in Appendix B to estimate our\nbias subspaces. We use the average token rep-\nresentation from each model’s last hidden state\n(last_hidden_state) as our sentence repre-\nsentation.\nD GLUE Details\nWe train each of our models for three epochs using\na maximum sequence length of 128, a batch size\nof 32, and a learning rate of 2e-5.\nE Additional Results\nIn this section, we provide a complete set of results\nfor all four of our pre-trained models. We brieﬂy\nsummarize the contents of each table below:\n8https://github.com/shauli-ravfogel/\nnullspace_projection\n9We found using a large number of classiﬁers for GPT-2 to\nbe unstable.
