  "abstract": "Healthcare workforce (HWF) shortages are the biggest challenges today in healthcare systems. Therefore, it is crucial to forecast the future needs of HWFs in order to plan accordingly. The purpose of this study was to identify, map, and synthesize the tools, methods, and procedures for measuring medical staff deficits in Europe. We used the Arksey and O’Malley scoping review methodology. Based on predefined criteria, 38 publications that were retrieved from multiple scientific databases, hand-searched on the internet, from relevant organizations, and scanned from references were considered. They were published between 2002 and 2022. There were 25 empirical studies, 6 theoretical papers, 5 reports, 1 literature review, and 1 guidebook. The majority estimated or measured shortages of physicians (14/38) and nurses (7/38) or looked at HWF generally (10/38). Various methods were used, including projections, estimations, predictions, simulation models, and surveys, which used tools such as special computer software or customized indicators, i.e., the Workload Indicators of Staffing Need method. Researchers estimated HWF shortages at both national and regional levels. Such projections and estimations were often based on demand, supply, and/or need. These methods and tools are not always suited to the needs of a country or medical facility, which is why they need to be further developed and tested.",
