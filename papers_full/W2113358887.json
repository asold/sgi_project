    "abstract": "Now days in all fields to extract useful knowledge from data, data mining techniques like classification, clustering, association rule mining are useful. In data mining classification is categorization of different objects and Clustering is methodology using which we will be able to club objects of similar type. Another methodology like association rule mining (ARM) [1] is useful to find out association relationship among different objects. This paper compares performance of different data mining tools [2] like WEKA [3], XLMiner [4] and KNIME [5] for these data mining techniques. We have used Statlog heart disease dataset [6] for analyzing performance of tools.",
