Key Words:  Large Language Models, Generative AI, Natural Language Processing, Automation in Construction   Introduction  In the realm of construction, an industry often characterized by complex projects and intricate workflows, the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant shift towards digitalization and smart technology integration. These models, residing at the intersection of natural language processing and generative AI, aim to emulate human capabilities in understanding and generating language. Generative AI developers strive to create models that can autonomously generate content, particularly in applications like chatbots, constituting what is known as ‘natural language generation’ tasks (Khurana, Koli, Khatter, & Singh, 2023). After years of extensive development, leveraging vast datasets and powerful computational resources, LLMs have evolved significantly, now exhibiting new capabilities like in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020). This advancement enables them to generate language in a contextually aware and human-like manner, paving the way for significant innovations across various industries.  These advancements in LLMs are particularly impactful in the construction industry, a sector traditionally reliant on manual processes and extensive documentation. The integration of LLMs \nEPiC Series in Built Environment\nVolume 5, 2024, Pages 414–422\nProceedings of 60th Annual Associated Schools\nof Construction International Conference\nT. Leathem, W. Collins and A. Perrenoud (eds.), ASC 2024 (EPiC Series in Built Environment, vol. 5),\npp. 414–422\npromises not only to automate and streamline these processes but also to bring a level of analytical depth and precision previously unattainable. The contextual language understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs are revolutionizing information processing and communication in construction projects. Their use in document analysis, quality control, data processing, and document creation streamlines complex tasks and enhances decision-making. This paper explores these applications, employing real-world examples and case studies to demonstrate the transformative impact of LLMs in construction.   Background  Large Language Models  Large language models (LLMs) are models based on transformer architectures that contain hundreds of billions of parameters. These models are pre-trained on vast corpora, often consisting of hundreds of terabytes of textual data (Shanahan, 2023). Notable examples such as GPT (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), Claude (Anthropic, 2023), and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) mark significant advancements in natural language processing. LLMs demonstrate profound capabilities in understanding and generating text, managing complex tasks that were traditionally the domain of human intelligence.   Recent research underscores the advanced capabilities of large language models, particularly in areas like in-context learning, instruction following, and step-by-step reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2023). These capabilities distinguish LLMs from their predecessors by enabling them to perform complex tasks more effectively. In-context Learning allows LLMs to comprehend and respond to prompts by using contextual information within the text, eliminating the need for further specialized training. This ability, introduced by GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), enables them to adapt to new tasks by referencing similar examples they've encountered during their initial training. Instruction following, enhanced by fine-tuning with diverse datasets, empowers LLMs to follow complex instructions and perform tasks beyond their initial training scope (Ouyang et al., 2022). This fine-tuning process allows LLMs to generalize their responses to a variety of unencountered tasks, demonstrating a flexible application of their learned knowledge. Step-by-step reasoning, facilitated by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy (Wei et al., 2023), enables LLMs to process tasks that necessitate multiple logical steps. This is particularly useful in problem-solving scenarios that require a clear, logical progression to reach a conclusion.   Current Research and Developments on LLMs in Construction  Current research in the construction sector is actively incorporating LLMs to tackle industry-specific challenges and improve operational efficiencies. In the realm of construction robotics, the RoboGPT system employs ChatGPT's advanced reasoning for construction task sequence planning, demonstrating the system’s capacity to adapt to complex and changing operations (You, Ye, Zhou, Zhu, & Du, 2023). GPT language models, such as ChatGPT, are also being evaluated for automating tasks like construction scheduling, with preliminary feedback suggesting a promising direction, although further development is recognized as necessary (Prieto, Mengiste, & García De Soto, 2023). The BIM-GPT framework merges GPT technologies with BIM to facilitate natural language-based information retrieval, significantly streamlining BIM accessibility and minimizing the engineering \nT ransforming Construction Practices with Large Language Models E.

BERT-based models are enhancing risk management strategies by demonstrating superior performance in identifying contractual risks within construction specifications compared to traditional machine learning approaches (Moon, Chi, & Im, 2022). Furthering this domain, ChatGPT's performance in risk management has been assessed, revealing its accuracy in risk response and monitoring, and identifying areas for advancement (Aladağ, 2023). Additionally, the potential of LLMs extends into building operations. ChatGPT has been applied to autonomous building system operations, minimizing energy use while maintaining optimal CO2 levels, thus illustrating its capability to augment building efficiency without the need for a learning process akin to that of traditional AI methods (Ahn, Kim, Cho, & Chae, 2023). GPT-4's abilities in data mining for building energy management have also been put to the test, demonstrating proficiency in code generation and problem-solving in scenarios such as energy load prediction and fault diagnosis, overcoming barriers to practical application of data mining methods in this domain (Zhang, Lu, & Zhao, 2024).  These investigations collectively highlight the versatile influence of LLMs in transforming the construction industry by enhancing information processing, task automation, and operational efficiency.   Applications and Use-cases of LLMs in Construction  This section highlights the varied applications of LLMs, from automating document analysis to customized systems.  Document Analysis and Quality Control  LLMs are revolutionizing document analysis and quality control in construction by automating the review of complex documents. This application involves analyzing specifications, plans, and compliance documents to ensure accuracy and adherence to standards. The sophisticated language understanding capabilities of LLMs allow for the detection of inconsistencies and potential issues that could affect project timelines and budgets.  An instance of this is the application of LLMs in constructability analysis. By evaluating the text within construction documents, LLMs can identify ambiguities and discrepancies that may not be evident at first glance. This proactive approach to document quality control can prevent costly and time-consuming revisions during later project phases, enhancing overall project efficiency.  Our exploration of this capability included the analysis of several construction drawings. Although predominantly visual, these drawings contain textual annotations, notes, and specifications which were subjected to LLM analysis. For instance, as demonstrated in Figure 1, we utilized Claude 2 (Anthropic, 2023) to evaluate a Power Plan drawing. Figure 1-a involved directing the model to identify any constructability issues in the initial permit version of the drawing. Figure 1-b then tasked the model with verifying the resolution of these issues in a subsequent version issued for construction. The model's analysis confirmed that previously ambiguous references had been clarified. Furthermore, by overlaying the two drawing versions in BIM360, depicted in Figure 2, we verified that additional details had indeed been incorporated into specific labels, such as 'ASSD'.  \nT ransforming Construction Practices with Large Language Models E.

W ang\n417\nData Processing and Information Retrieval  In the arena of data processing, LLMs excel at interpreting and extracting critical information from vast datasets. This function is particularly useful for managing the large volumes of data generated in construction projects, from detailed progress reports that track the minutiae of daily operations to exhaustive communication logs that capture every exchange. LLMs transform the way construction data is processed, moving from raw, unstructured information to carefully analyzed, strategic knowledge. This transition is pivotal in a sector where data accuracy and timeliness translate directly into operational success, safety compliance, and cost-effectiveness.  To critically assess the performance of LLMs in this task, we used GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to analyze and classify construction accident reports based on five key attributes: Injury Cause, Root Cause, Body Part, Severity, and Accident Time. The precision with which the LLMs categorized these reports underscores their utility in sorting and retrieving information accurately, a task fundamental to industry safety and compliance. The data preparation process involved manually annotating a dataset from the OSHA database with these attributes, reflecting real-world relevance to construction safety management. Utilizing the in-context learning capability of the GPT models, we crafted prompts that directed the models to accurately classify the reports according to the annotated attributes. This approach did not require explicit model training, as the GPT models leveraged the provided contextual information for understanding and categorization. This implementation was facilitated using OpenAI's API, specifically the Completion endpoint. Table 1 presents the evaluation of the models' performance, measured by an accuracy metric — the percentage of correctly classified instances against the total number of instances. This measure is critical in demonstrating the reliability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in processing complex, industry-specific data. Notably, GPT-4 achieved perfect accuracy in determining \"Accident Time\" and exhibited a 99.46% accuracy rate in \"Severity\" predictions. Both GPT models consistently maintained accuracy rates above 90% for most attributes. This classification ultimately aids in pinpointing trends and areas of risk, allowing for more targeted safety interventions and policy development. This robust performance of LLMs like GPT highlights the transformative impact that LLMs can have on enhancing data processing and information retrieval capabilities in the construction sector.  Table 1  Accuracy results for classification of accident reports Attribute GPT-3.5 (%) GPT-4 (%) Injury Cause 91.89 94.05 Root Cause 94.59 97.84 Severity 80.00 99.46 Body Part 88.11 94.59 Accident Time 94.59 100.00  Content Creation and Management  In the dynamic environment of construction, the creation and management of content are critical processes that directly impact project communication and archival records. LLMs are playing an increasingly significant role in these areas by automating and optimizing the production of essential documents. LLMs bring efficiency and consistency to the generation of project proposals, progress \nT ransforming Construction Practices with Large Language Models E. Ahmadi and C. W ang\n418\nreports, and final handover documents, ensuring that all written materials meet industry standards and contribute to a coherent project narrative.  One practical example of this application is the automated Meeting Minutes Generator. This tool was implemented to streamline the way meeting details are captured, especially in more extensive sessions. Once again, utilizing OpenAI's API, specifically the Completion endpoint, we enabled the generation of meeting minutes that are ready for use and could be directly uploaded into systems such as Procore. Upon evaluation, the LLM-generated minutes exhibited a remarkable reduction in human errors and provided an accurate account of decisions and assigned tasks. Figure 3 shows the Meeting Minutes Generator tool and a sample of a structured meeting minute derived from a BIM coordination meeting, evidencing the potential of LLMs to fundamentally enhance content creation and documentation tasks. The consistency and accuracy of content produced by such LLM-based tools can potentially revolutionize documentation practices in construction, ensuring that information is reliably captured and communicated, which is paramount for the success of any project. \n (a) \n (b) Figure 3.

Ahmadi and C. W ang\n419\nInteractive and Customized Systems  Interactive and customized systems powered by LLMs have the potential to transform the construction industry, enhancing workflows with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. These systems can be inherently adaptable, constantly evolving through fine-tuning and instruction-following enhancements to align closely with the demands of construction projects and the professionals who manage them. By feeding these models with clear directives and examples from the construction context, they learn to execute a variety of tasks.   We have recently begun experimenting with Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) Assistance and Safety Assistance Chatbots. A VDC Assistance system can be developed by fine-tuning the LLM using Building Information Modeling (BIM) Execution Plans and integrating project-specific data, such as design models, construction schedules, and resource allocations. Similarly, a Safety Assistance Chatbot can be built based on comprehensive safety protocols, workplace hazard identification techniques, and real-time incident reporting, enabling proactive safety management and rapid response to potential risks on construction sites. These experiments with VDC and Safety Assistance systems represent the initial steps toward harnessing LLMs for practical, interactive applications within the construction industry. While these systems are in the early stages of development, they showcase the potential adaptability of LLMs to the nuanced requirements of construction projects.   Current Limitations and Challenges  While the applications of LLMs in construction indicate a new era of efficiency and automation, there are several challenges and limitations that must be acknowledged and addressed.   Ethical Considerations and Data Governance  Ethical considerations play a critical role, especially in terms of data governance. This includes managing the privacy and security of the data fed into these models, such as project plans, specifications, and reports. Ensuring that the use of LLMs complies with data protection regulations and industry standards is crucial. Additionally, ethical concerns regarding the impact of automation on the workforce, in terms of job displacement and the necessity for upskilling, remain pertinent and must be addressed thoughtfully.   Addressing Issues of Accuracy, Trustworthiness, and Bias  Accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount in the construction industry, where errors can have significant financial and safety implications. While LLMs are powerful, they should not fully replace human decision-making but rather support it, given their potential for errors or overlooking nuances in technical documents. Inherent biases in training data can also skew outputs, impacting decisions. Continuous monitoring and critical evaluation of LLM outputs are crucial, ensuring they are used as an aid alongside human expertise to mitigate risks and maintain accuracy and reliability.   \nT ransforming Construction Practices with Large Language Models E. Ahmadi and C. W ang\n420\nTechnical and Integration Challenges  Integrating LLMs into existing construction management systems poses distinct technical challenges. A primary concern is ensuring compatibility with a variety of construction software, requiring the development of specialized interfaces or APIs. Equally important is adapting LLMs to accurately interpret the specialized lexicon and nuances of the construction industry, which might require additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, the dynamic and occasionally unpredictable nature of construction sites necessitates LLMs that function reliably under varied operational environments, supported by robust data processing and storage capabilities. Effectively addressing these challenges is critical for the seamless integration and utilization of LLMs in the construction sector.   Conclusion  Our investigation into the applications of LLMs in the construction industry has illuminated a path of significant progress and innovation. Through detailed analysis and real-world examples, we have shown how LLMs can enhance document analysis, optimizing data processing, and streamlining content management, marking a leap forward in efficiency and accuracy for construction operations. Our findings indicate that, while there are challenges to be navigated in integrating these technologies, their benefits in terms of operational optimization and decision-making are substantial.
