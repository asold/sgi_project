    "abstract": "Losses of distribution transformers (DT) in a distribution system (DS) depend on mainly load.Actual measurement of these losses is in substation (SS) feeder circuit is not easy due to many inconveniences like difficulty in installation of meters, unfavourable locations and conditions.But as the DT losses are sizeable they need to be considered for overall loss calculations.In this paper, an approach is developed to estimate the DT losses in a feeder circuit.Losses of individual DTs are calculated and summed up to give the losses due to DT circuit.A sample case of a large power system is considered.The losses are calculated by the said approach.The overall DT circuit losses are 8.57% of the total import.",
