INTRODUCTION\nTransformers play an essential role in maintaining the\nvoltage levels and reliability of power supply in transmission\nand distribution networks. The failure of a transformer in\nthe electrical power network is generally accompanied by\nhuge ﬁnancial and technical damage to the utilities. Thus,\ndemanding the need for efﬁcient and accurate condition\nmonitoring activities. In oil-ﬁlled transformers, most of the\nfailures are conﬁned to the integral parts of the insulation\nsystem [1]. Insulating liquid characteristics inﬂuence and\ngovern the performance of the insulation system in oil-ﬁlled\ntransformers. Over the years, various insulating liquids have\nbeen come to existence due to various reasons and require-\nments. However, mineral oils have been the most successful\ncandidates across the global [2]. The standards practice\nfor maintenance, condition monitoring, and reclamation of\nmineral oils have been drafted in [3]–[5].\nNevertheless, due to biodegradability, high thermal limits,\nhealth and safety requirements, sustainability, and demand\nfor high performance insulating liquids, ester liquids have\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Gongbo Zhou\n .\nbecome popular in recent decades [6]. Majority of the global\nresearch is afﬁrmative towards the use of these alternative\ndielectric liquids and is established that the performance\nof new liquids is comparable to mineral oils. It is to be\nmentioned that, the viscosity proﬁle and resistance to\nlightening impulse in ester liquids is inferior as compared to\nthe mineral oils [6], [7].\nSeveral utilities across the globe have started using ester\nliquids for new transformers, while a few have been retro\nﬁlled the existing units. The majority of these have been\nstarted using them as a representative sample to understand\nthe integral characteristics and service behavior of the new\nliquids. However, most of the utilities challenge the lack\nof proper design guidelines, condition-monitoring tools,\nknowledge on end-of-life behavior, and diagnostic limits.\nThe cost of the new insulating liquids is also one of the\nmajor issues; however, the cost of the dielectric liquid may\nbe evaluated in several aspects. If liquid to liquid is gaged\ndirectly, the cost of ester ﬂuids is higher than that of the\nmineral oil. To date, research on ester liquids out posted\nthe technical beneﬁts of using the new oil. The increased\nﬁre safety margin and ecological, health, and safety aspects\nfar outweigh the increased cost.

Mohan Raoet al.: On Some Imperative IEEE Standards for Usage of Natural Ester Liquids in Transformers\ntransformer insulation systems are designed to last for several\ndecades in-service, and hence limited information on retro\nﬁlling and mixed dielectric ﬂuids is another challenge to be\nconsidered.\nThe IEEE standards association has reported the dedicated\nstandards for the acceptance and maintenance of ester liq-\nuids [8] and dissolved gas analysis (DGA) [9] in ester-ﬁlled\ntransformers. This allowed utilities and engineers to have\nseparate standards for mineral oils and non-mineral oils.\nThe condition monitoring aspects and diagnostic tests (char-\nacterizations) have been a focus of the existing standards,\nwhile diagnostic limits and regeneration aspects of ester\nliquids have been least emphasized. Hence, the existing\nnon-mineral oil standards still require several improvements\nand much expanded knowledge on the new dielectric liquids.\nThe same has been the present focus of various working\ngroups, task force teams, and technical committees involved\nwith the development and establishment of knowledge on\nester liquids. Thus, considering the contemporary scenario\nin acceptance of the ester liquids with global utilities and\nresearchers, there is a need to understand the existing\nstandards from a much wider perspective. Therefore, authors\nhave emphasized on the critical analysis of the following\nimportant IEEE standards: i) Mineral oils: IEEE Std C57.106\n(acceptance and maintenance), IEEE Std C57.104 (Dissolved\ngas analysis), and IEEE Std 637 (reclamation). ii). Ester\nLiquids: IEEE Std C57.147 (acceptance and maintenance),\nIEEE Std C57.155 (Dissolved gas analysis). As the present\nmanuscript is mainly focused on, the said IEEE standards,\nall the evaluation methods and limits discussed in this\nanalysis are obtained from the same standards [3], [5], [8]\nfor analysis. Henceforth, to avoid duplication of the large\nnumber of evaluation titles, the citation of the titles is\navoided. However, the details of the same are available\nin [3], [5], [8] for readers. It is to be mentioned that, in order to\nemphasize, critical hypothesis concerning behavioral differ-\nences, similarities, and critical observations on both liquids,\npertinent and related citations from the available literature are\nincluded.\nThe considered standards and guides are analyzed in a\nway to understand the similarities and differences among the\nstandards for mineral oils and non-mineral oils. The sections\nof this article are organized in a way that utilities engineers\nand researchers may understand the critical differences\nbetween the properties and condition monitoring aspects\nof mineral and ester liquids. This will allow propelling\nthe research progress to attain further developments most\nappropriately. This analysis will also be helpful for the\nindustry in understanding the key condition monitoring\naspects of the new ester ﬁlled and retro ﬁlled units\nII. DIELECTRIC LIQUIDS ACCEPTANCE AND EVALUATION\nA. EVALUATION METHODS AND PROPERTIES\nInsulating liquid properties are the characteristic attributes\nthrough with the serviceability and effectiveness of the\nliquid are accessed to ensure the potential functionality\nof liquid insulation. Insulating properties include electrical\nand physicochemical properties, which are evaluated using\ndifferent standard test methods. The details of which are\ndiscussed in IEEE Std C57.106 and IEEE Std C57.147 for\nacceptance and maintenance of mineral oils and ester liquids,\nrespectively. The purpose of IEEE Std C57.106 includes\nevaluation procedures for acceptance of new (unused) min-\neral oils received from manufacturer separately and new oils\nﬁlled in apparatus. The evaluation procedures for in-service\nmineral oils and serviceable conditions, along with storage\nand handling procedures, have also been discussed. It is to\nbe mention that reclamation procedures and evaluation of\nreclaimed mineral oils have partially addressed in IEEE Std\nC57.106. Also, they are drafted in IEEE Std 637 in more\ndetail. Similarly, the purpose of IEEE Std C57.147 dealt\nwith evaluation procedures for the acceptance of new natural\nester liquid for new and retro ﬁll applications. The details\nof handling and evaluating the new liquid for on-site and\nstorage activities with maintenance procedures have been\noutlined. IEEE Std C57.147 also covers the reconditioning,\nreclamation, and environmental procedures for natural ester\nliquids. However, the discussion of reclamation, retro ﬁlling,\nand miscibility aspects are presented in a later section. In this\nsection, the evaluation test methods, properties, acceptable\nlimits, diagnostic limits (where available) of both the liquids\n(mineral oil vis-à-vis natural ester) are summarized.\nThe basic properties of insulating oil and various character-\nistics are listed in ASTM D117. However, all the signiﬁcant\nproperties have been addressed in both IEEE Std C57.106 and\nIEEE Std C57.147. The evaluation methods of mineral oils\nand natural ester insulation liquid are slightly different as per\nthe said standards. This difference is because of the inherent\nchanges in the chemical composition of both the liquids.\nHowever, most of the evaluation methods remain the same\nfor both the liquids, while a few are slightly updated.\nEven though the signiﬁcance and scope of the characteristic\nproperties remain the same, there is a need to understand them\nseparately with the appropriate evaluation methods. Given\ndifferences in the chemical compositions, the intensity of\naging reactions and nature of the aging byproducts varies.\nTo better understand and ease the analysis, various properties\ndiscussed in IEEE Std C57.106 and IEEE Std C57.147 are\nsub characterized as electrical and physical and chemical\nproperties in this section. It is to be mentioned that all these\nparameters are highly interrelated. A careful understanding of\ndifferent parameters is essential to understand the insulating\nliquid’s performance and ensure proper maintenance of the\nin-service units.\n1) ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES\nElectrical properties are the most important characteristics\nthat a potential insulating liquid is to be evaluated for min-\nimum satisfactory performance. However, this satisfaction\nlevel is to be within the agreement of the manufacturer and the\nVOLUME 8, 2020 145447\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: On Some Imperative IEEE Standards for Usage of Natural Ester Liquids in Transformers\ncustomer. Both ASTM D877 and ASTM D1816 methods are\nwidely accepted methods to determine the dielectric strength\nof electrical insulating liquids. Both these methods differ in\ntheir electrode conﬁguration and the state of the liquid in\nthe cell. ASTM D877 is involved in ﬂat-faced cylindrical\nelectrodes, a standard electrode gap of 2.5 mm while ASTM\nD1816 is performed with spherically shaped electrodes at a\ndistance of 1 mm and/or 2 mm. ASTM D1816 is equipped\nwith a head motor stirrer on the test cell to facilitate a gentle\nstirring motion of the liquid in the test cell. However, it is\nmentioned that ASTM D1816 is the best method to evaluate\nthe dielectric strength of a transformer insulating liquid due\nto the more representative electric ﬁeld generated with a\nspherical electrode conﬁguration. There is a scope for the\nremoval of ASTM D877 evaluation method for the evaluation\nof dielectric strength for transformer insulating liquids.\nExperience has shown that the dielectric strength of paper\nimpregnated in natural ester is almost the same as the one of\nmineral oil. However, for natural ester, the solid insulation\nimpregnated with ester must necessarily have a relatively\nhigher dielectric strength than that impregnated with mineral\noil before being applied in large transformers [10], [11].\nSimilarly, impulse breakdown is evaluated as per ASTM\nD3300 for both the liquids with understanding the presence\nof point-sphere electrode conﬁguration of the transformer\nmaterials and aging byproducts. Due to the higher viscosity\nof ester liquids, due attention is to be laid to avoid the water\nbubble trappings within the test cell.\nThus, to avoid trapped microbubbles of air in the insulating\nliquid due to a breakdown, a minimum or equal to 15 minutes\n(at room temperature) of the time gap is to be maintained\nfrom the instant the liquid is ﬁlled in the test cell. This may\nalso be applicable to the time gap to be maintained between\nrepeated breakdowns during experimental studies of ester\nﬂuids. Gassing tendency is evaluated as per ASTM D2300 for\nnatural ester and mineral oils. The gassing tendency of esters\nand mineral oils at various fault conditions is different.\nThe aging factor of the insulation also play a phenomenal\nrole. The gassing tendency of esters and mineral oils at\ndifferent faults and different aging conditions are reported\nin references [12], [13]. The dielectric dissipation factor is\ndirectly correlated to the measurement of the polarity of the\nmolecules in the oil. The comparison cannot be made directly\nbetween these two liquids because the mechanisms are\ndifferent. Indeed, the polarity of the triglyceride molecules\npresent in natural ester leads to a slightly higher dissipation\nfactor than mineral oil [14]. The formation of acids caused\nby intermediate species in mineral oil is due to an increase in\nits dissipation factor. For natural ester, this elevation varies\nonly according to its internal ester linkages. An oxidation\nreaction ensues, and increases more its acidity, resulting\nin an increase of the dissipation factor. It is therefore\nimportant in monitoring to consider the rate of change of\nthe dissipation factor, unlike the absolute value. Signiﬁcant\nelectrical properties and their evaluation methods for both the\nliquids have been summarized in Table 1.\nTABLE 1. Evaluation of electrical properties for acceptance of a new\nliquid.\n2) PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nThe physical parameters of an insulating ﬂuid must be\nevaluated from time to time to understand the insulating\nliquid’s degradation. Interfacial tension and color are the vital\nphysical characteristic parameters of an insulating liquid to\naccess the level of contamination [15]. Interfacial tension\nis one of the widely accepted aging markers for mineral\noils, and its application to ester liquids is challenging due to\nthe polar molecular structure of the ester group. However,\nunderstanding the color number and interfacial tension is\nessential to understand the degree of contamination of the\ninsulating liquid. The detrimental limiting values of interfa-\ncial tension will be different for ester and mineral insulating\nliquids due to the difference in the molecular structures.\nTo understand the risk of ﬁre associated with the insulating\nliquids, ﬁre point, and ﬂash point are evaluated. The risk\nof ﬁre in mineral oil-ﬁlled transformers may be accessed\ndirectly with the measurement of ﬁre point and ﬂashpoint.\nIn the case of ester liquids, these properties are to be used\nfor understanding the response of the liquid to heat and ﬂame\nunder controlled laboratory conditions. Evaluation of ﬁre and\nﬂash point to decide with the ﬁre risk assessment of in-service\nester-ﬁlled transformers is not recommended. This is because\nesters react to heat and ﬂame at a higher temperature as\ncompared to mineral oils [16]. Therefore, the risk assessment\nand maintenance of ester-ﬁlled transformers should not\nbe conﬁned to the higher ﬁre and ﬂashpoints alone. The\npertinent assessment of other related parameters may also be\nmonitored accordingly to understand the risk associated with\nthe ester ﬁlled transformers. Signiﬁcant physical properties\nand their evaluation methods for both the liquids have been\nsummarized in Table 2.\nPour point, and kinematic viscosity are another set of\nchallenging physical properties with ester liquids that are to\nbe understood. With reduction in temperatures, viscosity is of\nthe ester group is found to be higher than mineral insulating\noils [17]. Thus, inﬂuencing the liquid ﬂuidity with reduction\nin temperatures. Pour point is the temperature below which\nliquid starts freezing while inﬂuencing the liquid ﬂuidity.\nIt is reported that, the pour point may be inﬂuenced by\n145448 VOLUME 8, 2020\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: On Some Imperative IEEE Standards for Usage of Natural Ester Liquids in Transformers\nTABLE 2. Evaluation of physical properties for acceptance of a new liquid.\nthe effect of viscosity or previous thermal history of the\nspecimen [18]. It is to be noticed that viscosity increase is\nattributable to the oil contamination and oxidation rates while\npour point is least attributable to the degradation aspects\nand undergoing process. Further, in a transformer operating\nat lower temperatures, the reduction in liquid ﬂuidity is\nattributable to the average temperature for a deﬁnite time\nperiod, rather than the lowest recorded temperature. Hence,\ntraditional viscosity measurements around pourpoint temper-\natures may be confusing for comparing with the transformer\nliquid specimen. This is because of the signiﬁcant difference\nin the volume of the liquid in the real transformer and\nthe specimen volume used to measure viscosity and pour\npoint [18], [19]. Higher viscosity is generally noticed by the\ninteraction of the oil with atmospheric air (or oxidation) and\nwill polymerize the insulating liquid. It is to be ensured that\nnatural ester ﬁlled unit is not left de-energized for a longer\ntime. These conditions play a very critical role for especially\nester-ﬁlled transformers in cold climatic regions. Meanwhile,\nthe density of the oil may not be pertinent to the degradation\nevaluation; rather, it will provide an idea on the formation\nof free water or ﬂoating ice crystals in the transformers\nwhen reached less or equal to 0 ◦C. Thus, the agreement\nbetween the viscosity-loading guide-pour point is to be\nstrictly followed as per the manufacturer’s recommendation.\nThis factory guideline is also to be respected while selecting\nthe type of transformer. An important challenge concerns\nthe impregnation of blocks with natural ester. The viscosity\nof a ﬂuid is one of the important parameters that affect\nthe impregnation result of the solid insulation (paper,\npressboard and blocks). Comparative experimental studies\non the block impregnation process with natural esters and\nmineral oils shown that increase in the ﬂuid temperature,\ndecreases the viscosity and hence reduces the impregnation\ntime of the blocks [20]. It is therefore essential for the\nmanufacturer to determine the accurate temperature and time\nfor impregnation.\n3) CHEMICAL PROPERTIES\nChemical properties are unique integral properties for\nany insulating liquid that are sensitive to degradation,\ntemperatures, and operating environment. It is to be recalled\nthat mineral insulating oils and ester dielectric ﬂuids\nbelong to a completely different chemical group. Thus\nunlike, electrical and physical properties, chemical properties\ndiffer on a wide spectrum for ester and mineral insulating\nliquids. Also, chemical properties like water content, acidity,\ngassing tendency, and oxidation stability are important\ndiagnosing aspects for liquid-ﬁlled transformers. Therefore,\nin the present section, differences in assessment, behavior,\nand inﬂuence of the said chemical properties have been\ndiscussed. Water content in transformer insulating liquids is\ndetrimental to the life of the transformer, and unfortunately,\nthe presence of water in oil/paper insulation is unavoidable.\nPresence of water content in oil affects the dielectric\nbreakdown of any insulating liquids. Thus, there is a need to\nunderstand the hydrolysis, hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature,\nand water saturation behavior of insulating liquids. Esters\nare hydrophilic in nature and actively participate in hydrogen\nbonding as hydrogen-bond acceptors. This ability confers\nesters to have high water solubility, leading to higher water\nsaturation (depending on the temperature, 20-30 times more)\nthan mineral insulating oils [21]–[23]. In addition, the rate of\nhydrolysis of ester group is higher than that of the mineral\noils, and consequently, more moisture is absorbed in this\nprocess [24]. This leads to the formation of the long-chain\nfatty acids, which elevate the liquid’s acid number. Similarly,\nthe pyrolysis of cellulose insulation in ester produces a similar\nkind of acids (long-chain).\nAs more moisture is dissolved in esters, the pyrolysis\nrate will be less than mineral oils. It is to be recalled\nthat, the strength of an organic acid is inverse with the\nchain length. Thus, the long-chain fatty acid formed in\nesters are weak and are not detrimental to the insulation\nsystem. However, oxidation of esters produces short-chain\nfatty acids, which react vigorously with other transformer\nmaterials and promote the development of the oxidation\nproducts [25]. This is the reason for lesser oxidation stability\nand polymerization (gelling) of the esters. Further, esters\nare developed from the fatty acids accumulated in the\nvegetal seeds and ﬂowers; thus, the acidity of the base\nester liquids will be higher than mineral oils. Natural esters\nhave high molecular weight acids compared to mineral oil\nthat contains low molecular weight compounds [8], [25].\nTherefore, a higher acidity number of esters is not as\ndetrimental as the mineral insulating oils. The inﬂuence of\nacids in mineral oils and ester oils generated due to hydrolysis\nis summarized in Figure 1. It is also to be mentioned that\nthere will be a signiﬁcant difference in the oxidation process\nany bulk volume of ﬂuid to the thin ﬁlm oxidation. It is\nestablished that oxidation is vigorous on the surface that\nis exposed to air. Thus, thin ﬁlms exposed to air is of\ngreater concern to that of the bulk liquid in the tank [8].\nIt is experimentally veriﬁed that, bulk volume of natural\nester stored in uncovered tank or pool is less affected by\nthe oxidation when compared to the thin ﬁlms (impregnated\nby natural esters) [26]. However, different ﬂuids may have\nVOLUME 8, 2020 145449\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: On Some Imperative IEEE Standards for Usage of Natural Ester Liquids in Transformers\nFIGURE 1. Perspective of the hydrolysis and acid formation.\ndifferent safe exposure times and associated actions that are\nto be followed as per the proprietary recommendations.\nIt is inferred that; higher acidity of esters may be otherwise\nunderstood as a degree of dryness of the insulating paper\nwhereas higher acidity in mineral indicated the formation\nof sludge in the oil [14]. Hence, one may consider the\nacid number of mineral oils to decide with the reclamation\nand replace action while acid number alone is not capable\nof deciding this action in the case of ester liquids. The\nresistance to oxidation of natural esters is lesser than that of\nthe mineral oils. Thus, natural ester is not recommended for\nbreathing units, bladderless units, and thin-ﬁlmed surfaces.\nHowever, ester ﬂuid manufactures have emphasized this issue\nin recent years. The surface of the natural esters polymerizes\nwith continuous exposure to the air. This may possibly\nincrease the liquid viscosity, initiate gelling, and reduce\ncooling capabilities. The relationship with the exposure time\nof natural ester (liquid surface and thin ﬁlm) to air and\npolymerization is still a challenge. Different natural esters\nwill have different acceptable exposure limiting times (in\ncase of maintenance); thus, any de-tank maintenance activity\nfor natural ester ﬁlled transformers parts may be performed\nas per the recommendations of the manufacturers. There\nis no established and approved method for evaluating the\noxidation stability of the natural esters. It is mentioned that\nthe existing methods ASTM D2112 and ASTM D2440 have\nno agreement between the laboratory evaluation and ﬁeld\nperformance of ester liquids. ASTM D2112 is used as a\ncontrol test to evaluate the sustainability of the oxidation\ninhibitors, while ASTM D2440 is applicable for evaluating\noxidation inhibitors and the consistency of oxidation stability\nof mineral insulating oils. However, these methods are not\napplicable to ester ﬂuids. However, IEC 62770 proposed a\ntest method for evaluating the oxidation stability of natural\nesters with a modiﬁcation of heating time to 48 hours. The\nevaluation methods of the signiﬁcant chemical properties for\nboth the liquids have been summarized in Table 3.\nB. ACCEPTANCE AND MONITORING\nInsulating liquids are factory processed and are later trans-\nferred to the transformer customers with due care. The\nnew, unused liquids are mostly shipped in tanks (drums,\nTABLE 3. Evaluation of chemical properties for acceptance of a new\nliquid.\ncontainers, and rail tanks) and are ﬁlled into the transformers\nat the site. In some cases, the transformer is ﬁlled with\ninsulating liquid and are the unit is shipped along with\nthe oils to the site. However, in both cases, due care is to\nbe maintained by the manufacturer in ensuring the liquid’s\nquality to serve as an effective insulant and heat exchanging\nmedia. The unused insulating liquids are to be evaluated\nby the customer before accepting in order to understand\nthe properties of the liquids that are pertained during the\nshipping. The evaluation methods and accepting limits for\nunused mineral insulating oils and natural esters should be in\naccordance with ASTM D3487 and ASTM D6871, respec-\ntively. Meanwhile, the waiting time to energize after ﬁlling\nthe insulating liquid into the transformer is traditionally the\ntime until room temperature is achieved. In the case of\nester-ﬁlled transformers, a longer time is required because\nesters consume higher time to penetrate through the new\npressboards. This wait time or standing time is attributable\nto pressboard type, the thickness of pressboard materials,\nvoltage class of transformer, ﬁlling temperature of liquid\nand ambient temperature. For the distribution transformers,\n8 hours to 24 hours waiting time is recommended, while for\npower transformers, a minimum of 24 hours waiting time is\nadvised. However, manufacturer recommended standing time\nis to be preferred if such information is provided. Later the\nliquid is to be evaluated before energizing the transformer.\nIn cases where the evaluation of the new insulating liquids\n(shipped for ﬁlling in the units at the site) is not completely\npossible as per ASTM D3487/ASTM D6871, the minimum\ntests and the corresponding limiting values that need to be\nperformed are summarized in Table 4.\nAs discussed earlier, in some cases, shipment is made\nwhile the oils are ﬁlled in the transformers. In this case,\nthe insulating liquid is to be sampled from the transformer and\nis to be evaluated before the transformer is energized. It is to\nbe mentioned that, sampling procedure for mineral oils and\n145450 VOLUME 8, 2020\nU.

Acceptable limits for unused shipped Liquids.\nester liquids is to be performed as per ASTM D923 unless\nany special manufacturer requirements are mentioned. The\nlimiting values for insulating liquids ﬁlled and shipped along\nwith the transformers before energizing are tabulated in\nTable. 5 for different voltage classes. In any case, a minimum\nof breakdown voltage, interfacial tension, water content, and\ndissipation factor are important parameters for the acceptance\nof mineral oils.\nDegradation of an insulating system is preliminarily initi-\nated due to the presence of oxygen, water, and temperature.\nIt is to be understood that the presence/occurrence of these\nfactors is unavoidable, and hence manufacturers of mineral\noils consider the inclusion of inhibitors with allowable limits.\nHence, it is important to evaluate the liquid properties to\nensure the continuity of the liquid for service. In view\nof the above-said reasons, protecting the pristine liquid\nconditions is not possible, and all efforts are required to\nevaluate and maintain the conditions that are close to pristine\nconditions while being in-service. Generally, aged oil may be\nclassiﬁed into three classes, Class I (liquid may be acceptable\nto continue use), Class II (liquid may be questionable to\ncontinue use), and Class III (liquid may be not acceptable\nto continue use). A clear availability of limiting values\nfor different classes for ester-ﬁlled transformers is still a\nchallenge. However, the acceptable limits to continue using\nthe liquids in service have been summarized for different\nclasses in Table 6.\nThe similarities and differences in evaluation methods\nof various properties from the target IEEE standards are\ndiscussed above. In most cases, the tests used to evaluate\nmineral oils are also used to evaluate natural esters. However,\nthe interpretation and the meaning of the results are different\nsince the chemistries of the two types of liquids are\nvery different. Therefore, the evaluation methods that were\npreviously applicable only for mineral oil and are now\napplicable are listed below.\n• ASTM D971: Standard test method for interfacial\ntension of oil against water by the ring method. Because\nof the high hydrophilic nature of natural esters when\nnew, the interfacial tension is lower when compared\nto mineral oils (the highest values are in the mid-20s\nmN/m) [27]–[29]. Under service conditions, acids and\nVOLUME 8, 2020 145451\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: On Some Imperative IEEE Standards for Usage of Natural Ester Liquids in Transformers\nTABLE 5.

Mohan Raoet al.: On Some Imperative IEEE Standards for Usage of Natural Ester Liquids in Transformers\nusing VDE electrodes. This method is applicable for\nnatural ester with an increase the resting time prior to\nthe ﬁrst breakdown.\n• ASTM D2440: Standard test method for oxidation\nstability of mineral insulating oil. This method is\napplicable for natural ester if heating time is reduced to\n48 hours.\nCurrently, the standard IEC 62021-1 used to determine\nthe acidity in mineral oils is also applied to natural esters.\nThe maximum acidity limit value for in-service natural\nesters with voltage class <69 kV is 0.3 mg KOH/g [30].\nThere is no indication in the literature for voltage classes\n> 69 kV . Some authors have shown that the acidity of\nesters increases proportionally overtime, and this increase\ncould extend well beyond the speciﬁed limit value, even in\nan enclosed environment with minimal oxygen. [30], [31].\nBetter aging performance of cellulose has been found in\nnatural ester with a high level of acidity compared to mineral\noil [30]. In addition, the differences in the acidity levels and\noxidation rates of mineral oils and natural ester liquids are\nchallenging aspects too. However, the limits for the acidity\nhave been established but the optimal weights and types\nof the acceptable oxidation inhibitors are to be determined.\nThe widely accepted oxidation inhibitors for mineral oils\nare 2,6-ditertiary-butyl phenol (DBP) and 2,6-ditertiarybutyl\npara-cresol (DBPC). ASTM 2668, ‘‘Standard test method\nfor 2,6-ditertiarybutyl para-cresol and 2,6-ditertiary-butyl\nphenol in electrical insulating oil by infrared absorption’’\nis used for direct estimation the said inhibitors in mineral\noil. In case of natural esters, the manufacturers blend\npertinent proprietary inhibitors to the liquid. Therefore,\nspeciﬁc inhibitor content evaluation testing techniques will\nbe required for ester-ﬁlled transformers.\nIII. DISSOLVED GAS ANALYSIS (DGA) AND DIAGNOSIS\nDissolved gases in insulating liquid are normally formed due\nto the decomposition of insulation liquid and solid insulation.\nThe decomposition of the insulation system is occurred\ndue to several reasons with main factors, including thermal\nand electrical fault conditions. As the chemical composition\nof mineral insulating liquids and ester liquids is different,\nthe gassing tendency of both the liquids is different. Even\nif the type of gasses generated for different fault conditions\n(electrical and thermal) are the same, the detrimental levels of\ndifferent gas concentrations will be different for different liq-\nuids. Therefore, IEEE Std C57.104 and IEEE Std C57.155 are\nadopted for understanding dissolved gases generated in\noil-ﬁlled transformers and ester (natural and synthetic) ﬁlled\ntransformers, respectively. Nevertheless, as the type of gasses\ngenerated for similar faulty conditions are the same in both\nmineral and ester liquids, the same sampling and test methods\nare applicable. In addition, the information provided in IEEE\nStd C57.155 is mostly based on laboratory experienced\ndatabase and limited-service experiences. This is due to\nthe limited in-service experience database for ester ﬂuids.\nThe critical limits mentioned in IEEE Std C57.104 are derived\nfrom numerous service experience of mineral oil that is\ngained over the years. The conclusions in the IEEE Std\nC57.155 are reported from limited sources.\nHence, the data provided by the manufacturer, the new and\nin-service history of the same unit may always be preferred.\nIt is to be mentioned that, the effect of the stray gassing in\nester ﬂuids is to be laid emphasize in order to avoid masked\ninterpretations of the dissolved gasses. The evaluation of stray\ngassing is evaluated as per ASTM D7150 at 120 ◦C. It is\nreported that ethane is produced in the ester group liquids\nunder normal conditions too. This stray gassing is seen high\nin the initial times and is settled over time. The generation\nof ethane is sensible to oxygen, light, and heat; thus, care\nshould be taken in handling, storing, and accepting new ester\nliquids. In addition, stray gassing of ethane may reach several\n100 ppm and must be considered to establish the baseline or\nsignature of a transformer.\nIn IEEE C57.104, concentrations of individual and total\ndissolved combustible gasses have been used for identifying\nthe risk associated with incipient internal faults. Whereas,\nin IEEE C57.155 the gas rate limits discussed are applicable\nonly when no previous history is available and is for reference\npurposes only. However, the annexures included in IEEE\nC57.155 presents experimental experiences and comparison\nwith various oils. Interpretation of dissolved gasses for min-\neral oils has been presented in IEEE C57.104 using Rogers\nration method and Doernenburg ratio. Further, to advise\nthe diagnostic action, four cases have been identiﬁed with\ndifferent individual gas values. Also, to understand the gas\nin the air phase Ostwald solubility coefﬁcient of various\ngasses has been presented. In IEEE C57.155, interpretation\nand diagnosis have been majorly emphasized on Duval’s fault\ngas analysis. Thus, there is a lot of scope for developments in\nthe existing standards concerning the fault diagnosis of ester-\nﬁlled transformers, and there is also a need to understand\nthe inﬂuence of the aging markers on the gas trending. The\nsummary of the gases for various fault conditions has been\nsummarized in Table 7.\nIV. RECLAMATION OF AGED OILS\nReclamation of aged oils is performed to remove the products\nthat are developed in the insulating liquids because of the\nservice aging. The byproducts of aging may be but not limited\nto acids, cellulose decay particles, colloids, polar solvents,\nwater content, dissolved gasses, sludge/ contaminants, and\nother transformer materials [32], [33]. Insulating liquids may\nbe subjected to reconditioning, reclamation, or replacement\nbased on the status of oil health, service life, and ﬁnancial\nconditions. It is to be understood that, treatment of insu-\nlating liquids may also remove desirable additives such as\ninhibitors; thus, evaluation and addition of new components\nis required after the treatment.\nReconditioning of insulating includes dehydration and\ndegassing; this is mostly performed when dissolved gassing\nVOLUME 8, 2020 145453\nU. Mohan Raoet al.: On Some Imperative IEEE Standards for Usage of Natural Ester Liquids in Transformers\nTABLE 7. Details of dissolved gases for various fault conditions.\nor water content is more while other parameters are in\nthe acceptable limits. Reclamation of insulating liquids\nis emphasized on the removal of acids, sediments, and\ncontaminants by suitable adsorbents or mechanical agita-\ntions [34]. The details of the various treatment process\nfor mineral insulating oils have not been discussed in\nthis section due to pagination and documentation lengths.\nAs per IEEE Std 637, the gravity-percolation method is\nsuitable for the static treatment process (treatment plant is\nﬁxed, and oil is brought from different units), and portable\npressure percolator treatment is suited for dynamic treatment\nprocess.\nHowever, as per IEEE Std C57.147 magnesium aluminum\nphyllosilicate, magnesium silicate activated alumina, and\nin addition, the mixture of these adsorbents may also\nimprove the removal performance. The determination of an\neffective adsorbent and treatment process for ester liquids\nis still a challenge. Despite any clay/adsorbent and any\ntreatment process, the following process shown in Figure 2 is\nto be essentially followed during the reclamation process\nof both ester and mineral insulating liquids. It is to\nbe noted that, treatment temperature of above 70 ◦C for\nmineral insulating oil hampers the oxidation stability. The\nsame may be applicable for the treatment of ester ﬂuids\nunless the manufacturer mentions a speciﬁc temperature.\nIn addition, the choice of reconditioning and reclamation\nFIGURE 2. Procedure for reclamation of transformer insulating liquids.\nlimits are not established and is attributable to use discretion\nor manufacturer recommendations. Further, the choice of\n145454 VOLUME 8, 2020\nU.

This depends on several factors like cost,\navailability of treatment equipment, treatment materials, and\nlabor.\nV. CONCLUSION\nOver the years, insulating liquid has become a key con-\ncern for the condition monitoring engineers in ensuring\nproper maintenance of liquid-ﬁlled transformers. Meanwhile,\nbiodegradable insulating liquids are established to be a\npotential choice for transformer insulation technology. Sev-\neral utilities across the globe have started using these new\ninsulating liquids for new transformers while a few are retro\nﬁlled. Different normative have been outlined for mineral\nand ester insulating liquids due to the phenomenal difference\nin the chemistry. Therefore, there is a need to understand\nthe commonalities, differences, and challenges following the\nexisting imperative standards of both the insulating liquids.\nIn this article, efforts are made to analyze and summarize the\nsigniﬁcant IEEE standards concerning acceptance, condition\nmonitoring, diagnostic, and reclaiming aspects. The present\nanalysis is important for researchers and industry for further\nimprovement of the norms, and effective maintenance of\nester-ﬁlled transformers.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D. Martin, J. Marks, T.
