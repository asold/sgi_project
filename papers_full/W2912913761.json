All of the participants in the project  examined the current situation of modern \nmarketing communication. An important role in modern marketing is played by \ncommunication, mainly with customers, suppliers and the public. All forms of \ncommunication, including messages from individuals or entire organisations, represent a \ncommunicator, influence trustworthiness and contribute to the forming of a company's image. \nIt is important to focus on the material form of the contents of messages, the cultivation of \nexpression and a creative means of presenta tion. Using social media has become a trend in \nmarketing communication. One characteristic of this is the ability to address a large target \ngroup in as short a time as possible to convey messages to their recipients, in most cases at \nminimal cost. Over the relatively short period of their existence, social media have undergone \nirreversible development. The  reason is the huge potential of social media in their use for \ncommercial purposes. \n \nThe main aim of this work was to identify ways of utilizing social me dia for commercial \ncommunication with consumers. Another aim of this work was to identify options for using \nsocial media in commercial communication with consumers. Fulfilment of this aim was \nachieved through studying, primary research and statistical anal yses, from which the specific \ncommunication is composed . Then followed implementation of the model in practice and its \nsubsequent evaluation . The results can then serve as a guide for other companies facing \ncompetition with multinational chains. Although s ocial media can be used by any business, \nthis contribution focuse s on their use by family firms. These firms can be characterised as \n149 \nbusinesses over which a family has the decisive influence. Such decisive influence is \nidentifiable if a family entirely dom inates the company in relation to one of the decisive \nfactors, such as equity or membership in the statutory body, or if the lesser influence of one \nfactor is made up for by the corresponding influence of another factor. However, one \nnecessary condition is the family's share of equity.  \n \n1 Literature Overview \nMarketing has come to the fore in the modern business world. This is reflected by the fact that \nin many companies marketing costs make up  to 50% of all corporate costs  (Kotler, 2003). \nCompanies that maintain a long-term leading position in the market realise that marketing is a \nkey business activity and is crucial to the success of the business. Crainer states that \n\"marketing reveals the needs of the customer, it designs products that meet their require ments \nand demands, and then creates a support system designed t o ensure customer satisfaction\"  \n(Crainer, 2000). For most businesses and organisations, the place where customers willingly \nspend time – often engaged in conversation about the business or orga nisation – is a social \nnetwork or on -line community dedicated not to brands, products, or services, but rather to \nother people like themselves,  with interests like their own  (Markova and Petkovska -\nMirčevska, 2013). One of the latest trends in marketing is the use of social media, which have \nbecome an integral part of applying a marketing communication strategy (Cervenková, Simek \nand Stoces, 2011). Social media via the internet brings together people who cannot physically \nmeet. Social media as a tool has various purposes and serves for sharing information and \nentertaining users of a virtual network, helping others find work and forming associations \nbased on ethnicity or other cate gories (Homolková and Taliánová , 2012). The popularity of \ninternet social media over the last few years has grown extremely  quickly, and particularly \namong young people it is one of the most utilised means of communication ever, which is also \nconfirmed by research by the organisation EUKidsOnline. Social media can be summarised in \nrelation to marketing using the following points: \n- Social media are constantly changing, and their contents are formed as well as shared by \nusers. Marketers can quickly find out on social media what customers demand, what their \nopinions are regarding brands and what they complain about (Janouch, 2011, p. 210). \n- Using social media can represent a competitive advantage , an aid that can make a business \nexceptional (Blažková and Dědková, 2014). \n- There are situations when social media save time or help acquire information that a company \notherwise would not get. Subsequent sharing of information among fans represents an \nopportunity to spread commercial messages in a vital way (Dunda, 2011). \n- Social media provide feedback, create a relationship between a company and a fan, provide \nopportunities for applying targeted advertising, contribute to the acquisition of new customers \nand help boost the re putation of a brand or p roduct (Bednář, 2011). Social media as a tool in \nrelation to the customer needs to be seen as a tool for building a long -term relationship and as \nan opportunity to form the company's image in a targeted manner at relatively low cost. \nActivities on social media are  conditioned by interaction with the target group and getting to \nknow their views and opinions, which can then be used for the bene fit of marketing \ncommunication (Fedorko and Bacík, 2013). \n \nInteresting results related to research into social media have bee n presented by Fishburn \nHedges and Echo, who state that year -on-year more than 18 million customers in Great \nBritain have communicated with brands via social media. Up to 65% of addressed customers \nwho have used a form of communication via social media als o agree with the view that social \nmedia represent a better form of communication than traditional tools  (McNaughton, 2012). \nThe results of research by the marketing agency Conversocial, published in October 2013, \n150 \nfocus primarily on customer support in soci al media environments. The research points out \nthat 81% of the top 100 on -line vendors respond to customer support inquiries via Twitter. \nAbout 80% of  companies also communicate with customers for support purposes via \nFacebook (Conversocial, 2013). Social Media Today and SAP have presented results, \naccording to which  of 118  addressed companies, 71 % stated that they actively used social \nnetworks as a tool for customer support. Within this group of respondents, more than 65% of \ncompanies stated that they viewed the influence of social networks  on the customer support \nprocess positively or very positively (Heiligman and  Lieu, 2012). \n \nFamily businesses are understood worldwide as the largest driver of the economy, since 80% \nof all businesses in the world are in the hands of families (such as retail chain Wal-Mart and \ncar maker Ford). Interest in family businesses is growing worldwide, as evidenced by the \nincreasing use of the terms “family business” or “family company” in scientific articles \n(Hnátek and Hnátková, 2014). However, in Central Europe , family business is understood as \nthe activity of small or at the most mid -sized enterprises. Such situation has arisen in Central \nand Eastern Europe thanks to the post -war nationalisation of large family companies, whos e \ntradition no one managed to continue after the fall of Communism in 1989  (Koráb, \nHanzelková and Mihalisko , 2008). Family business is a specific model of company \nmanagement and has many pros and cons. On the one hand, there is a larger community \namong members of families, and a large role is played by informal connections.  On the other \nhand, family business activity can also have a very unpleasant effect on the functioning of a \nfamily under certain circumstances. If the business is participated in by a fa mily as a whole, \nthen in the event of failure and/or at a time when the company is not succeeding, the entire \nfamily truly suffers as a result. \n \nLong-term research conducted by the Czech Association of Small and Medium -sized \nEnterprises has revealed that 1 5% of GDP can be attributed to family firms, which is due to \nthe relatively short history of business activity in the Czech Republic. According to the \nresearch, 50% of customers consider these companies' products as high quality, and 46% say \nthey are relia ble. Customers are mostly motivated to make purchases from family firms by \nquality (71%), the personal approach to the customer (54%) and support for local production \n(49%) (Probyznys, 2014). Sectors that are specific for family business activity are also \ninteresting. According to a study carried out by the Equa B ank, the Czechs mostly buy \ngroceries from family firms (87%), followed by crafts (75%), services (44%) and clothing and \nshoes (37%)  (Equa Bank , 2014). Finally, it is necessary to define the term \"f amily firm\" \nclearly. The term \"family firm\" is perceived differently in different areas, and there is no exact \ncommon definition worldwide. For the purposes of this work, the characteristics of a family \nfirm are as follows:  \n- At least two individuals dire ctly participate in the management of a company, and these \npersons together or their families own at least a 50% stake in the particular company. \n- The company has a history of more than ten years. \n- In the future, the company will belong to a close relati ve, which will preserve the ownership \nstructure. \n \n2 Methodology \nAt the beginning of the project, a conceptual framework was set up which defined the \napproach that the research team would use. This conceptual framework ensured that \nindividual activities cor responded to each other, so that a logical correlation would be  \nmaintained; the concept is presented in figure 1. The first part of the concept, which contained \na thorough investigation of research mainly from literary sources and scientific databases, \n151 \nserved as an informational basis for the entire project. These secondary sources focused on the \ncharacteristics of the issue, which consisted of a study of the latest trends related to social \nmedia and the exact definition of family business. Primary studies corresponded to the \nresearch part, which were a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. Both \nmethods of research were applied in relation to each other. The qualit ative research preceded \nthe quantitative research. The qualitative part, which w as realised with the help of interviews \nwith various focus group members , had an exploratory purpose, which served for \nfamiliarisation with the issue from the point of view of social media users.  The number of \nparticipants in each focus group was 7 – 11 persons. The length of the interviews was roughly \nset according to the number of questions to an hour and a half . In order to collect data, a \nresearch team made up of five persons was put together . The results of the interviews \nconducted in this way were eva luated by a team made up of two experts in the field of social \nmedia, two persons employed in marketing and one psychologist . The results of the focus \ngroup interviews served for setting up a comprehensive questionnaire, which was \nsubsequently distributed to respondents with experience with social media. From the \ninformation originating from the qualitative research, a questionnaire was set up, which \nserved as a basis for the quantitative research. The questioning was based on direct or \nmediated contact bet ween the researcher and each respondent. The electronic questioning \nmethod was used. The subject of the questions was social media, and therefore this subject \nwas selected as a communication channel, which was complemented by questioning via e -\nmail. An adv antage of electronic questioning was the ability to focus on certain groups of \nrespondents with relatively low costs.  The survey consisted of 20 scaled questions that come \nfrom the previous focus group. The questions assessed the importance of individual a ttributes \nusing a seven -point scale . 600 completed questionnaires were approved for the survey . \nQuestionnaires that were incomplete or logically unsuitable were excluded. Respondents were \ngrouped according to demographic characteristics  – sex, age, education and economic \nactivity. The survey was designed just for Czech respondents, the reason being the specific \nway in which Czechs approach social media. \n \nFigure 1: Conceptual framework of this document \n \nSource: authors' calculations. \n \nAnother step was a statistical evaluation, in which three types of variables were used: \nnominal, cardinal and ordinal. The main method is based on descriptive statistics, to which a \ngreater dimensional factor analysis was linked, which focused on an analysis of the structure \nResearch:  \n1. Literature  \n2.

During interpretation \nof the factors, the factor burden was e xamined, which was represented by a correlation \ncoefficient between the original variable and the factor. Correlations greater than ± 0.5 were \nconsidered significant. If any variables did not reach the specified values, they were excluded, \nand the analysis  was carried out again , sometimes several more times, until the correlation \ncoefficients of all variables reached the minimum value of ± 0.5. The purpose of this approach \nwas to obtain an optimal number of variables. The obtained factors were named based o n the \ncomposition of the variables (Meloun and Militký, 2006).  \n \nSetting up the communication model was the conclusive result of the first part of the project, \nlasting one year. Therefore, a model makes it possible to show objective reality in a simplified \nmanner and to capture only the aspects of the particular phenomenon that are considered \nimportant, meaning those that are close to the purpose that the model is intended to fulfil . \nAfter setting up the communication model, qualitative research was conduct ed using a \ncomparison method, which is one of the basic methods of collecting primary data. Twenty \ncompanies were always selected on each type of social media, and they were subjected to \nthorough observation. The beginning of the practical verification of the empirical research in \nthe form of implementation of the communication model in practice involved setting up a \nsuitable approach, which lasted one year. The approach to the implementation was set with \nsix points, which are presented in figure 2. \n \nFigure 2: Implementation approach  \n \nSource: authors' calculations. \n \nThe evaluation of the implementation was the last part of the entire process and was taken \npart in by a group consisting of marketers with experience and academic wor kers involved in \nmarketing. The evaluation was carried out in five independent parts. The first phase, during \nwhich the company prepares the presentation but is not yet actively promoting it, is called the \nlatent phase. This is followed by the active commu nication phase, in which the company \npromotes its activities with the aim of acquiring a fan base. The third phase is the viral \ndistribution phase, in which the company attempts to shift the initiative involving acquiring \nnew fans to the existing fans of the presentation. In the fourth, saturation phase, the number of \nfans does not increase significantly, and this phase is optimal for communication with fans \nwith the aim of transforming the communication with them through conversion. Once the \npresentation has fulfilled its purpose, there is an ongoing fifth phase, which in some cases can \nend by leaving the social network (Bednář, 2011). \n \n \nImplementation of the communication model in practice \n \n1. Defining the reasons for entry to and the reasons for expanding of social media. \n2. Determining the aims of marketing communication on social media. \n3. Describing the current status of communication on social media before implementation . \n5. Setting up a specific implementation of the model (type of social media, communication tools, \ncontent formation, social involvement). \n4. Determining the target group based on sorting parameters. \n6. An overall evaluation of the success of implementation of the communication model whilst \nfulfilling the marketing communication plan on social media. \n153 \n3 Research into current communication on social media \nThe main aim was the implementation of social media in family busin ess environments. The \nalready presented model was used as the main way to apply social media successfully in \npractice. However, this model is only a simplified way of noting the process that can lead to \nsuccess. In order for success in communication to be achieved, it was necessary to complete \nthe model with a range of solution variants across all four points in the model. If there is a \nsufficiently large range of options, then it will be up to the company to decide which strategy \nor tactics to choose in co mmunication. For fulfilment of the communication model through \ncontent, the \"observation\" method was used, which was applied to the most successful \ncompanies on social media. Communication tools in various modifications were examined. A \nresearch team was s et up for evaluation, which consisted of three experts in marketing \nresearch. Such research was applied to companies which due to their characteristics belong to \nthe category of family business. The evaluating parameters are presented in table 1. The table \npresents six evaluating factors which originated from secondary research conducted by Ad \nage, in which 500 marketing experts in on -line communication  participated. The  was \nconverted into percentage weight values, which served for determining which compani es \nwould be examined. These five attributes  were monitored for the 20 most successful \ncompanies with the largest numbers of fans. The results of the observation were used for \ncommunication options of family companies. \n \nTable 1: Evaluation of company communication \nOrder Evaluating point of view of communication on social media Weight of individual variables \n1. Building brand awareness 45% \n2. Increasing a website's visit rate 20% \n3. Gaining fans and evaluators 10% \n4. Regular contact with customers 10% \n5. Forming business relationships 10% \n6. Business relationships  5% \nSource: authors' calculations. \n \nThe first point in the model is selection of the type of social media. If social media are \nreferred to as a communication tool usable for marketing, then it  is necessary to divide social \nmedia correctly based on  the application of marketing tactics. Marketing tactics can be \ndefined as the ways companies fulfil their communication strategies. They can be divided as \nfollows: \n Social networks - Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, Google+ \n Blogs - own websites, public spaces \n Micro blogs - Twitter \n Discussion forums, QaA portals - public forums, Yahoo!, Answers \n Wikis - Wikipedia, Google Knol \n Social bookmarking systems - Digg, Delicious, Jagg \n Shared multimedia - YouTube, Instagram \nFor each type of social media, there are basic variants most commonly used in the EU.  \n \nAnother part of the communication model was the selection of communication tools for \nsetting up a corresponding communication mix: \n Social networks - Advertising, Sales support, Public relations, Direct marketing, Viral \nmarketing, Guerrilla marketing,  Mobile marketing, Buzz marketing \n Blogs - Advertising, Sales support, Public relations, Direct marketing, Engagement \nmarketing, Mobile marketing, Astroturfing \n154 \n Micro blogs - Advertising, Sales support, Public relations, Direct marketing, Engagement \nmarketing, Mobile marketing, Astroturfing \n Discussion forums, QaA portals - Advertising, Public relations, Direct marketing, \nAstroturfing \n Wikis - Public relations, Mobile marketing \n Social bookmarking systems - Advertising, Public relations, Mobile marketing, Buzz \nmarketing \n Shared multimedia - Advertising, Public relations, Viral marketing, Engagement \nmarketing, Product placement, Mobile marketing. \nIt is apparent from the results  that a different communication mix is used for each type of \nsocial media. The summary of these communication tools was added to the descriptions of the \nmore detailed characteristics of individual marketing communication methods.  \n \nThe third point in the m odel, corresponding to setting up a communication mix , is content \ncreation. Each communication mix tool has its own specific form of tactics on social media. \nThese tactics change relatively quickly over time, and the situation that research has identified \nmay change in just one year. This point needs to be subjected to regular updating.  \nThe results of the observation are presented in the following points: \n Advertising - advertising banner, pop-up, catalogue, sector portal, context ad (link). \n Sales support - discounts, samples, coupons, contests and surveys. \n Public relations - company blogs, press releases, conferences, sponsoring.  \n Direct marketing - newsletter, chat, social communication, forums. \n Guerrilla marketing - provocative, controversial, erotic, hum orous and/or aggressive \nmeans of conveying information. \n Buzz marketing - whipping up excitement about a product through non -conventional, \nshocking, sexy or humorous marketing methods. Users can talk about products themselves \nwithout the company's involvement.  \n Viral marketing - funny and interesting messages (photos, videos, text) are spread through \na network via users forwarding them to others. \n Product placement - Products or services are intentionally placed in films, music clips \nand/or video games.  \n Mobile marketing - use of display on mobile devices, such as mobile phones and iPads.  \n Engagement marketing - companies engage customers in the creation of offers, product \nappearances and proposing sales methods. The customer is pulled into the game and \nbecomes an active builder of the brand. \n Astroturfing - companies use paid positive reactions from consumers or fans to promote \ntheir brands. These are fictitious positive and/or negative reactions. \n \nThe result was 11 types  of marketing communication tools which companies apply in \npractice. This interconnection forms the basic attributes for subsequent implementation of the \ntactics in practice. The fourth part of the communication model is social engagement. It is an \nenhancement added to a message, which responden ts in all examined groups consider to be \nvery serious. Social engagement affects customers, but they must find out about it. The social \nmedia area is an ideal platform for informing customers. The most important areas of social \nengagement for respondents are: environmental protection, ethics and support for sport.  \n \n4 Implementation of social media in practice \nThe main aim of the project presented in this document was to identify options for using \nsocial media in marketing communication with consumers in fa mily firm environments. The \nresults of the project could subsequently serve family firms as a guide or as assistance in the \n155 \npractical involvement of social media in communication with customers. For the \nimplementation of social med ia in practice, a communication model was used which was the \nsubject of previous research by the author and presented in a periodical with an impact factor \n(Myslivcová and Ungerman, 2014). This model is primarily designed for  small and medium-\nsized enterprises, among which fall th e family businesses with which cooperation was \nestablished. The contribution confirms the possibility of using this model in practice \nespecially for family businesses . The communication is however merely a simplified \nrendering of the process . Its specific fulfilment of the communication strategy and tactics \nsuitable for family businesses is the only basic difference from general utilization of the \nmodel. The model is thus designed for all companies, but the contents presented in Chapter 3 \nare specifically for family businesses. This implementation of social media was carried out in \ncooperation with three family companies in order to ensure objectivity. In order to ensure the \nrequired extent, only yearly cooperation with one company is presented. \n \n4.1 Presentation of the family firm \nIn order to protect the cooperating company from competition, its name and the names of its \nowners were changed herein. Company X was established in 1995 by Mr and Mrs Novák, and \nsince its founding it has been involved in the industrial production of a specific product \nintended for construction. Company X, through its characteristics, fulfils the pre -defined \nparameters for a family firm. In terms of size, it is a small company which employs 30 people. \nIt is a prospering company whic h has a stable position on the Czech market. It uses special \ntechnology to manufacture a specific product, which it sells on the industrial market. The \ncustomers of Company X are both domestic and foreign. Since deliveries have stabilised in \nthe recent per iod and Company X possesses available production capacity, the owner has \ndecided to apply a growth strategy. The company's marketing communication is not very \nextensive, and therefore the owners of the company have decided to establish cooperation \nwith the author in order to engage in communication via social media. \n \nReasons for entering social media \nThe main reason why the prospering company decided to enter a new communication \nchannel, social media, was that there were major opportunities on the market. T hese \nopportunities were related to the significant growth in demand for products on the B2C \nconsumer market, which was based on new technology in the construction sector and \nreduction of the prices of offered products. Until then, the company was involved only on the \nB2B industrial market. Company X decided to react to the opportunities by addressing \nindividuals and smaller construction companies.  \n \nDefining the objectives \nDefining the objectives corresponded to the reasons that led to the company' s entry into social \nmedia. The main aim was to acquire new customers from the consumer market. This main \naim is broken down in detail below and consists of the following objectives: \n to acquire 500 active fans on social media within three months; \n to get 30 new fans each subsequent month; \n to get 50 new comments from fans per week; \n to consistently maintain 5% of active fans from the total number of fans on social media; \n based on  the conversion to  social media, negotiations with a new client regarding an \norder should occur at least once per month; \n 1,000 people should be persuaded to view company presentations on shared multimedia; \n information should be provided intensively about products on the consumer market; \n156 \n construction companies which could use the product sold by Company X  should be \ncontacted. \n \nInitial status of marketing communication  \nThe marketing communication of Company X at the time of cooperation did not include any \nactivities on social media. The communication of Company X was primarily focused on the \nB2B market, and its communication mix was based on that focus and involved personal sale s \nand direct marketing. It can be stated in general that the communication of Company X was \nvery limited and focused only on forming business relationships with existing cus tomers. \nEfforts to acquire new customers were minimal. \n \nDetermination of the target group \nDetermination of the target group was based on the aims that led Company X to get involved \nin social media. The target group was determined with consideration for the specific uses of \nthe offered product in the construction sector. The offered product is of very high quality, but \nis relatively expensive and is used during the construction of family houses. This was the \nbasic premise during the definition of the target group, which consisted of the sorting \nparameters of age, education and economic activity. The target segment consists of people \nover the age of 30 who have a regular income and belong to the upper middle class. Education \nis also related, given that the product, due to its specific characteristics, would tend to impress \ngroups of customers with higher professional or university education  more. In terms of \neconomic activity, the product is clearly intended for economically active persons.  \n \n4.2 Strategic communication solution \nA strategic phase corresponded to the preparation phase, and this strategic phase already \nincluded a practical solution. Cooperation began in June 2013, and its duration was agreed \nupon for a period of one year. The reason for the involvement mainly of social media was the \nwillingness to invest only relatively limited financial means into the communication \ncampaign, and social media are cheaper in this respect than traditional media. The strategic \nproposal is presented in figure 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n157 \nFigure 3: Communication model of family business X \n \nSource: authors' calculations. \n \nThe first point of implementation of social media was clearly defining the target segment. The \nmodel includes an exact specification of the target group, which consists of individuals over \nthe age of 30 who are economically active and have a university education. Company X \nintended to establish a long-term relationship with this target group.  \n \nThe selection of social media as the second point of the communication model was relatively \nfar-reaching and courageous, considering the fact that Company X did not have any \nexperience with such means of communication. Company X proposed implementing three \ntypes of social media into the communication. From the range of social networks, the first \nchoice was clearly Facebook, which is currently the most widely used social network in \nCentral Europe. The second choice was the continuously developing social network Google+. \nThe reason for choosing two social networks was that if content was created for one platform, \nit could be mirrored for another social network in the same style. Of the shared multimedia \nplatforms, again, two were chosen. The first choice was clear. YouTube was selected for \nvideos. This choice was a logical tool enabling the presentation of products during the \nconstruction of family houses. The second chosen multimedia platform was Instagram, which \nserves for the presentation of photos of already fulfilled orders. The reason for the company's \ndecision to present photos was again to familiarise users with the options for use of the \nproduct in the construction sector. The final choice was a micro blogging platform. Due to its \npopularity, Twitter was the only possible selection. The reas on was the need to familiarise \nusers with the company and its product. The aim was to prompt discussion about topics \nrelated to the construction of family houses, in which the offered product could be used. \n \nQUALITY OF                                               \nCONTENT \n \n• information veracity  \n• information clarity \n• provision of solicited \ninformation only \n• information completeness \n• regular updating \n \n \n \nBuilding a relationship \n \nSocial networks \n(Facebook, Google+) \nShared multimedia \n(YouTube, Instagram) \nMicro blogs (Twitter) \n \n- Open Doors Days \n- Support for local \norganisations \n- Environmental \npresentation \n \nAdvertising  \nSales support \nViral marketing \nGuerrilla marketing \nAdvertising \nViral marketing \nAdvertising \nPublic relations \nAstroturfing \n \nAdvertising (PPC)  \nConnection with other media \nResponses in comments \nUse of photos and videos \nContests, games  \nAdvertising (PPC) \nExceptional content \nSupport for discussion \nAdvertising (PPC)  \nDetermining users' opinions \nInformal communication \nUse of questions \nInsertion of click-through links \n \nFamily \nBusinesses \nTarget segment: \n- individual \n - above age 30 \n- economically active  \n- university education  \n \n158 \nSetting up the communication mix was the content  of the third point of the model. For the \nsocial networks Facebook and Google+ the communication mix was identical, and contained \nadvertising, sales support, viral marketing and gue rrilla marketing. The representative of \nCompany X decided to promote mainly  advertising focused on an exactly defined market. A \nmajor effort by Company X was also devoted to attracting the public's attention via gue rrilla \nmarketing, which was subsequently spread virally via social media. For both YouTube and \nInstagram an identica l communication mix was also set up, since they each involved a \nsomewhat different presentation method. The communication mix contained advertising, \npublic relations and viral marketing. For shared multimedia as well, greater emphasis was \nplaced on paid ad vertising for an exactly defined group of potential clients. Advertising was \nviewable always at the beginning when the presentation was started by people from the target \ngroup. The targeted advertisement was added in an effort to spread videos and photos v irally. \nThe communication mix for Twitter consisted of three tools: advertising, public relations and \nastroturfing. The use of targeted advertising again created a basis for communication on \nTwitter. Company X even resorted to a controversial tool, astrotu rfing, based on which it \ncommented on individual contributions, but pretended that the comments had been added by \nusers.  \n \nThe fourth part of the communication model is content creation, which is based on the exact \nspecification of the method of fulfilling  the communication strategy. This fulfilment method \ncan also be referred to as a tactical one, and it is necessary to re -evaluate such tactics \nregularly, which Company X has done every month. The model specifies only original \nprocessing for the start of the communication. It is followed by a brief analysis of tactics to \nget an impression of how the method of fulfilling the communication mix looked . Specific \ntactics correspond to individual types of social media: \n Facebook, Google+ (PPC advertising, links with other media, responses to comments, \nusing photos and videos, contests, games).  \n YouTube, Instagram (PPC advertising, exceptional contents). \n Twitter (PPC advertising, determining users' opinions, informal communication, using \nquestions, supporting discussion, inserting click-through links).  \nThe biggest opportunities for acquiring new customers from the consumer market were \nfocused on PPC advertising, in relation to which payments are made simply as a result of \nusers opening links. This targeted communicat ion mix led to an increase in expenses. Besides \nadvertising, the tactics were based on a variety of content which would be connected across \nall types of social media. A time schedule was also part of this point in the communication \nmodel. It can generally be stated that each communication mix was synchronised in time, and \nthat the implementation occurred based on the marketing employee's capabilities. \n \nThe final part of the communication model is social engagement. Although this involves \ncommunication via social media, social engagement occurs in real life and only subsequently \noccurs on social media. The social engagement proposal involved three activities: an Open \nDoors Day, support for a local organisation and an environmental presentation  of the \ncompany's business. The Open Doors Day was a one -off event tied to a cultural programme, \nwith a presentation of the company's own products. It was presented on social media a month \nbefore it started. During this event and after it ended, information about it was p resented \nextensively on social media. Subsequently , all records and comments were presented in the \nform of text, photos and videos on all of the social media platforms that Company X had \nchosen. The local organisation that Company X chose to support was the local fire brigade, \nwhich is highly appreciated by the public and is appropriate for presentation on social media. \nSince Company X pays very close attention to adhering to environmental principles, in order \n159 \nto fulfil this part of the communication strategy, it only needed to present its activities in a \nfree form on social media.  \n \nConclusions \nThe final evaluation of the implementation of social media was carried out by the company's \nowner and an independent group consisting of a marketer with experience a nd two academic \nworkers involved in business marketing. The evaluation had two parts. The first involved \nevaluation of the qualitative points of view in connection with the building of relationships \nwith consumers. The second part evaluated the quantitative indicators based on data from \nFacebook Insights, which provides statistics about Facebook related to fans, their likes and the \nreach of published contributions , as well as about page visit  rate and users' involvement. For \nthe statistical evaluation of da ta from Google+, the Google Analytics tool was used, which \ncan calculate the value of social networks and measures sales, conversions and visitors' \ninteractions with content published on the web and on social networks. A crucial factor in \nview of the set o bjectives was data concerning to what extent people coming from social \nnetworks become real customers. This information was monitored with the help of discount \ncodes published only on social networks together with asking new customers how they had \nbecome aware of the company.  \n \nThe independent team evaluation from a time scheduling point of view on social media goes \nthrough five phases. The evaluation was presented in individual phases: \n- Latent phase - this included the preparation of presentations on soci al media, which were \nconceived as an independent project. This phase was prepared with a limited time schedule. In \nthe latent phase, initial messages presented only for social networks were put together. The \ncompany first focused on preparation of the cont ents of advertising, which was provided by a \nspecialised agency. Other activities were ensured by the company's own employees shortly \nbefore the campaign was started. The company prepared instructional videos and photos of \nsuccessful projects and prepared contests and a lot of information based on scenarios for the \ngradual promotion of discussions. The evaluation of the preparatory phase revealed absolute \nsatisfaction, which was due to the sufficient amount of time, the involvement of \nprofessionally educated people and enough financial means. \n- Active communication phase  – as soon as the presentation had been  prepared, filled with \ncontent and had an acceptable form, it was launched. The strategy included three types of \nsocial media, and initially the company  focused only on social networks, where it attempted \nto gain a fan base with the help of the administrator's friends and subsequent viral promotion. \nThe effort to underestimate in communication led to a relatively significant amount of \n\"liking\". Paid advertising enabled the company to put out clear messages with graphic content \nto a pre-defined segment. Over time, with the help of barter cooperation, it became possible to \nconnect links with the presentations of cooperating companies. It also became possible  to \npromote like boxes for all used social media on the first page of the web presentation. After a \nmonth, the company succeeded in filling all of the planned types of social media with content. \nThis phase lasted approximately a month, and during that mont h contact was established with \napproximately 500 fans on all types of media. The activities on both social networks were \nevaluated positively, but the situation when addressing fans on shared multimedia platforms \nand Twitter was worse. Overall, this phase appeared successful, since all planned activities \nhad been fulfilled, and fans' participation corresponded to this. \n- Viral marketing phase – In this phase, the main goal was to support fans by encouraging the \nmost activity and initiatives to expand the ba se of fans and for the institutionalised spread of \ninformation to be replaced by viral marketing. This step was very successful, since its key is \nquality content of the presentation and interaction with fans, and the company achieved these \n160 \ngoals. The basis  for success was regular updating and interesting contents, which users \nviewed as very interesting. Interactions gradually grew in the group, to which Company X \nmanaged to respond adequately. According to the plan, this phase was supposed to last \napproximately four months, but the company managed to fulfil it after three months. The \nevaluation of this phase was positive, since two -way communication was established, along \nwith retaining of users' interest for the entire three-month period. \n- Saturation phase  - in this phase, the target number of users had already been achieved, \nwhich subsequently grew very slowly. This phase was conditioned on huge success in the \nprevious phase. The impact on the target group was significant and directly led to an increase \nin demand for the product. Successful communication contributed to growth in the company's \nturnover. The evaluation of this part was positive, even though it cannot be determined \nexactly what share of the turnover increase could be attributed to communicatio n on social \nmedial.  \n- Ongoing phase - in the previous phase, a culmination of the effects of communication was \nachieved, and therefore the presentation on social media fulfilled its purpose. It was necessary \nto continue the path of this success so that th e tendency of fans' involvement would not \ndecline. Thanks to regular re -evaluation of communication tactics and a constant innovative \napproach, this phase was a success, and the number of the company's fans grew slightly on all \ntypes of social media. \n \nOn b ehalf of Company X, the cooperation on social media was evaluated directly by the \ncompany's owner, who was clearly satisfied with its entry into social medial. The owner \nwants to continue participating in social media even after the cooperation ends, and he has set \ngoals for an increase in activities in the future. The greatest satisfaction was expressed with \nthe universality of the model. The following principles were strictly adhered to, which are \ndescribed in the middle of the model and which led to succ essful communication: truthfulness \nof information, comprehensibility of information, only requested information, complete \ninformation, regular updating. Social media resulted in increased demand, addressing a new \nmarket and building better relationships wi th customers. The following conclusions emerge \nfrom the final comparison of the results achieved and the exact goals that were set : 3,250 fans \nin total were gained on the social networks Facebook and Google plus, instructional and event \nvideos were viewed by 11,460 people, and its Twitter micro blog has 1,120 followers. About \n6% of the fans are active and provide regular feedback . On the B2B market it managed to \nestablish contact via social media with  55 construction companies . The aim of this entire \nproject was through the aid of social media and implementation of the latest marketing \napproaches to help family businesses and thereby support sustainable development mainly in \nsmall towns and municipalities. This objective was successfully fulfilled, and this document \ncan serve as a guide for other family businesses. During the final summarising, the team of \nevaluators agreed on the huge success of implementing practical use of social media. Not only \nwas cooperation with Company X evaluated well, but cooperation with two other family firms \nwas, too, and although they had selected a different strategic and tactics, their success was \ncomparable. Company X, following a year of cooperation on the use of social media, \nsuccessfully entered the consumer market and was helped in doing so by communication on \nsocial media. Although the financial benefits of implementing communication via social \nmedia cannot be identified  exactly, the proportion of costs and revenues clearly generated \nprofit. The team also positively evalua ted the social impact of involvement in social media. \nThe owners reacted to the increase in demand and Company X's entry into a new  market by \nincreasing the number of employees, which is having a positive effect on the region. This \nproject highlights the i mportance of family businesses and their positive effect on economic \nsustainability.  \n161 \nReferences \n[1] AD AGE, 2012.
