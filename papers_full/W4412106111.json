    "abstract": "To address the limitations of existing learning path recommendation methods—such as poor adaptability, weak personalization, and difficulties in processing long sequences of student behavior and interest data—this paper proposes a personalized learning path recommendation system for the second classroom based on large language model (LLM) technology, with a focus on integrating the pre-trained model GPT-4. The goal is to improve recommendation accuracy and personalization by leveraging GPT-4’s strong long-sequence modeling capability. The system fuses students’ multimodal data (e.g., physiological signals, facial expressions, activity levels, and emotional states), extracts deep features using GPT-4, and generates tailored learning paths based on individual feature vectors. It also incorporates incremental learning and self-attention mechanisms to enable real-time feedback and dynamic adjustments. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is introduced to enhance diversity and innovation in recommendations. The experimental results show that the system achieves a personalized recommendation accuracy of over 92%, with coverage and recall rates exceeding 91% and 93%, respectively. Feedback adjustment time remains within 1.5 s, outperforming mainstream models. This study provides a novel and effective technical framework for personalized learning in the second classroom, promoting both efficient resource utilization and student development.",
