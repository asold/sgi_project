One obvious\napproach in improving the overall healthcare system is by\neliminating  the  existing  inefficiencies  that  impede  our\nsystem1–3. Removal of inefficiencies impacts our system of\nhealthcare in two inherent ways: significant improvement of\nthe  patient  outcome,  and  a  reduction  in  the  cost  of\nhealthcare. Although in principle it is clear that removal of\ninefficiencies is beneficial, in practice there has been little\neffort in removal of the existing inefficiencies. This lack of\neffort is rooted in the complexity of our healthcare system\nthat  has  manifested  itself  as  a lack  of consensus  on  the\nmethod of removing the existing inefficiencies. \nIntegration of technological advances in our healthcare such\nas utilization of mobile devices, availability of broadband\nsystems  with  high  throughput,  and  embedded  clinical\ndecision systems4–6 can be cited as some approaches that can\nreduce overall inefficiencies of our healthcare system. One\nbranch  of  healthcare  that  can  benefit  from  better\nstreamlining of patient-care through integration of clinical\ndecision  support  is  in  emergency  care  during  a  mass\ncasualty incident7 (MCI). The rapid operational tempo of an\nEmergency Room (ER) serves as an ideal vehicle to study\nany  existing  inefficiencies  while  the  resource-limited\nconditions of an MCI will help in clearly gauging the impact\nof any proposed improvements. MCI events clearly require\nrapid treatment of patients with minimum interruption for\ndata collection, while optimal treatment of patients requires\nthe  hindering  and  cumbersome  completion  of  detailed\npatient  information  to  identify  the  culprit  chemical\nsubstance.  These  two  competing  objectives  have\ntraditionally  been  a  major  impediment  in  optimizing  the\nMCI treatment process with a natural priority extended to\nrapid treatment of patients. Therefore, there has been little\nadvances in improving treatment of chemical MCI events.\nResearch is needed to build a better understanding of the\ninformation and technological needs of the healthcare and\npublic  health  workforce  during  emergency  decision\nmaking8.\nA limited set of clinical decision support software have been\nintroduced by the larger community 9. The National Library\nof Medicine has created the Wireless Information System\nfor  Emergency  Responders 10 (WISER),  which  allows\nemergency responders to identify a list of possible chemical\nsubstances based on the observed patient symptoms. The US\nDepartment of Health and Human Services has developed\nanother  software  tool  named  the  Chemical  Hazards\nEmergency  Medical  Management-Intelligent  Syndromes\nTool11 (CHEMM-IST).  CHEMM-IST  is  a  prototype  that\nguides first-responders through a series of questions related\nto signs and symptoms that leads to a probabilistic diagnosis\nof four syndromes rather than a list of chemical hazards.\nAlthough such software make significant strides in assisting\nthe process of emergency care, their efficacy have not been\nassessed during a chemical based MCI. \nIn this report we examine the effectiveness of WISER as the\npotential  software  for  early  identification  of  chemical\nmaterial  during  an  MCI  event  using  simulated  patient\nsigns/symptoms (SSx) that we have reverse engineered from\nWISER. We also report results from Binary Decision Tree\nand Artificial Neural Network applications to the same set\nof simulated patient data. We conclude by reporting results\nof our initial investigation aimed at dimensional reduction\nof  SSx  space.  Our  final  objective  is  to  challenge  the\nparadigm that rapid patient treatment is in contrary to data\nAn AI model for Rapid and Accurate Identification of\nChemical Agents in Mass Casualty Incidents\nNicholas Boltin1, Daniel Vu1, Bethany Janos1, Alyssa Shofner1, Joan Culley2 and Homayoun Valafar1*\n1Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC\n2College of Nursing , University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC \n*Corresponding Author: homayoun@cse.sc.edu\ngathering that will assist in early identification of culprit\nchemical.  We contest  that  careful  design  of sophisticated\nclinical decision support tools can satisfy both competing\nobjectives  of  rapid  information  gathering  and  accurate\nchemical identification processes.\n 2 Materials and Methods\nOur  general  approach  consists  of  creating  signs  and\nsymptoms  (SSx)  for  simulated  patients  using  a  reverse-\nengineered table of SSx from the WISER application. Using\nthe  simulated  data,  we  then  proceed  to  evaluate  the\nsuccessful identification of a culprit chemical using WISER,\nBinary Decision Tree (BDT), and Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN) machine learning approaches. \n 2.1 WISER\nWireless  Information  System  for  Emergency\nResponders10 (WISER) is  a free application available for\nAndroid  and  iOS,  which  can  also  be  downloaded  as  a\nstandalone application on a desktop computer. Developed\nby the National Library of Medicine (NLM), WISER is a\nsystem  designed  to  assist  emergency  responders  in\nhazardous material incidents. It provides a wide range of\ninformation on hazardous substances, including substance\nidentification support, physical characteristics, human health\ninformation  and  containment  and  suppression  advice.  Its\nkey  features  include  rapid  access  to  the  most  important\ninformation about a hazardous substance by an intelligent\nsynopsis engine and display called “Key Info”, and access\nto NLM’s Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB), which\ncontains detailed peer-reviewed information on hazardous\nsubstances and comprehensive decision support. \nThe key feature in WISER most relevant to this work is the\nSubstance ID Support (SIDS). This allows an emergency\nresponder to input patient SSx, from which the SIDS will\nidentify one or more likely hazardous  chemicals  causing\nthose symptoms. WISER contains a checklist of 79 SSx,\nwhich are input for selected systems of the body through an\ninteractive  tool  as  seen  in  Figure  1A. As  the  signs  and\nsymptoms are entered (F igure 1B) the pre-populated library\nof 438 hazardous substances is successively reduced. The\nuser  can  view  the  list,  select  a  substance  and  view\ntoxicology  information  available  in  the  HSDB,  which\ncontains  data  from  the  NLM  Toxicology  Data\nNetwork12 (TOXNET).  The  HSDB  data  file  contains\ninformation  on  human  exposure,  industrial  hygiene,\nemergency  handling  procedures,  environmental  fate,\nregulatory requirements and related area.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1. Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders\n(WISER) for Android operating system. Panel (a) is the Interactive\ntool and panel (b) is the symptom selection interface. Panel (b) also\nshows the substance ID support in which an emergency responder\ncan identify an unknown substance based on signs and symptoms\nof victims.\n 2.2 Reverse engineering and compression of \nWISER database\nA  thorough  evaluation  of  WISER  necessitated  reverse\nengineering of all WISER’s substances with their associated\nSSx.  This  task  was  performed  by  manually  reviewing\nNLM’s HSDB and parsing the SSx for each substance. An\nexample of the resultant table of SSx is shown in Figure 2.\nEach of the 438 substances found in WISER is represented\nin  the  first  column  in  this  table,  and  the  following  79\ncolumns represent the corresponding SSx found in WISER\nfor a given chemical. The presence or absence of each SSx\nis indicated by a 1 or a 0 respectively. \nFigure 2.WISER’s reconstructed database using NLM’s toxicology\ninformation stored in the Hazardous Substances Data Bank \n(HSDB).\nExamination  of  the  created  database  revealed  several\nsubstances with identical SSx profiles. In such instances, a\ncluster of chemicals was reduced to a single representative.\nThe  list  of  uniquely  distinguishable  chemicals  was  then\nreduced  from  438  substances  to  311  unique  substances,\nwhich  serves  as  the  reverse-engineered  list  of  unique\nchemicals.\n 2.3 Creation of Simulated Victims (Test Set)\nSimulated  patient-data  were  generated  from  the  ideal\ndatabase  of  311  unique  substances  by  perturbation  of\nrandomly selected Ssx.  This was done to precisely control\nthe amount of missing data.  Signs and symptoms related to\na real MCI would be ideal, however accurate patient records\nduring  these  scenarios  are  limited  and  usually\nincomplete13,14.  Each substance was replicated 100 times to\ncreate a reasonably extensive testing set that consisted of\n31,100 simulated victims. Three data-sets were created by\nrandom  toggling  of  selected  SSx  at  5%,  10%,  and  15%\nselection  rates.  To  ensure  the  proper  random  selections,\nprobability density profiles were examined for the number\nof perturbed SSx across each of the simulated patient-data.\nAn overview of the perturbed data-sets (shown in Figure 3)\ncorroborates the intended rates of perturbation. \nFigure 3.The Kernel Density Estimation of the 3 test data-sets. Test\ndata were created by starting with the ideal table of symptoms \nfrom WISER and changing the symptoms by 5%, 10%, and 15%.\n 2.4 Overview of Machine Learning \nApproach\nOur general work-flow for creating predictive models can\nbe  found  in  Figure  4.  Supervised  machine  learning\ntechniques were utilized in the Matlab 2015Rb environment\nto identify patterns and to develop predictive models. Our\nprocess began by importing the reverse-engineered database\nof 311 unique substances followed by training of two types\nof classification models: Binary Decision Trees (BDT) and\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN). After successful training\nof  a  given  model,  the  known SSx  profile  for  all  311\nsubstances  was  tested  on  the  trained  model  to  establish\nproper  learning  (testing  for  memorization  versus\ngeneralization is conducted in a different step). The model\nwith the highest accuracy during the training was chosen as\nthe final model. Evaluation of each trained model was then\nassessed  using  the  SSx  profiles  of  the  31,100  simulated\nvictims. A prediction accuracy was calculated as shown in\nEquation 2. In this equation A represents the accuracy of the\nmodel  (expressed  in  %),  Nc indicates  the  number  of\ncorrectly identified chemicals, and Ntotal represents the total\nnumber of trials  (31,100  in  this case).  The next sections\nprovide  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  training  and\ntesting for each model.\nA=( Nc /N Total)⋅100   (1)\nFigure 4.Work-flow for exploration of data, training models and \npredicting substances using supervised machine learning \ntechniques\n 2.5 Training and Testing of Classification \nMethods\nWe evaluated three common classification approaches in our\ninvestigation.  The  classification  approaches  consisted  of:\ndatabase  look-up  (as  implemented  by  WISER),  Binary\nDecision Trees, and Artificial Neural Networks. Details for\neach of the three approaches are described in the following\nsections.\n 2.5.1 Database look-up (WISER)\nThe interactive nature of WISER was the limiting factor in\nautomated  and  batch  evaluation  of  WISER  for  31,100\npatients each represented by 79 SSx. This limitation served\nas one of our primary motivations in establishing a local\ndatabase  of  WISER  SSx.  The  first  step  in  replicating  a\nprocess  identical  to  the  WISER  application  was  to\nunderstand  its  selection  logic.  WISER  selects  chemicals\nonly based on the presence of a SSx and not its absence.\nTherefore, WISER will identify the entire library of 438 (or\n311  unique)  chemicals  as  the  potential  list  of  possible\nexposed chemicals for a patient exhibiting no apparent SSx.\nWhile this logic may appear questionable in our application,\nwe proceeded with our evaluation of WISER in an exact\nfashion.  Our  initial  evaluation  of  WISER  consisted  of  a\nquery-based search of our local database of chemicals using\nMySQL database engine housed on an Ubuntu LTS 14.04\nserver. This approach required a database look-up for SSx of\nall 31,100 simulated patients. Since the WISER approach\nmay  (and  most  likely  will)  return  a  list  of  potential\nchemicals, the database look-up step is followed by a search\nfor existence of the right chemical in the list of returned\nchemicals. Although the time requirement of this evaluation\nmechanism was feasible (in the order of a week) for a list of\n31,100  patients,  it  is  an  impractical  approach  for  future\ninvestigations with larger data-sets in order to establish a\nmore thorough evaluation of the methods. Our most current\napproach  consists  of  an  in-house  developed  program  to\nsimulate this table look-up process. Our evolved approach\nreturns the identical results that WISER would return while\nreducing  the  search  time  from  months  to  seconds.  Our\ntesting process consisted of recording the number of times\nthat the correct chemical was present in the list of returned\nchemicals similar to Equation 1. \nSince  WISER  operates  in  a  deterministic  fashion,  a\nstatistical model of its performance can be developed. By\nassuming  that  every  patient  will  undergo  alteration  of\nexactly  n SSx,  it  can  be  argued  that  WISER's  outcome\nshould closely follow a success rate shown in Equation  2.\nThis equation lists all of the possible perturbation of SSx\nthat  will  result  in  removal  of  the  correct  chemical  in\nWISER’s  resultant  list.  This  equation  can  be  simplified\nusing the Binomial theorem as shown in Equation 2. Based\non binomial distribution modeling of the WISER's outcome,\na success rate of 6.25%, 0.4% and 0.02% can be expected\nfor the cases of 5%, 10% and 15% perturbation of SSx.\nr=1−∑i=1\nn\n(\nn\ni )pi\n(1−p)(n−i )\n= 1\n2n   (2)\n 2.5.2 Binary Decision Tree\nA  Binary  Decision  Tree  (BDT)  was  trained  using  the\nreverse-engineered  WISER  database  within  the  Matlab\n2015Rb environment. A maximum deviance reduction was\nused as the split criterion with 350 maximum splits. Each of\nthe 311 chemicals was replicated 312 times to facilitate the\nconstruction  of  a  complete  tree  and  in  consideration  of\nMatlab's training algorithm. Under this training conditions,\na classification rate of 100% was achieved. \nOur adopted testing procedure consisted of observing the\nchemical identification accuracy of the trained network with\nthe simulated patient-data. It is noteworthy that the trained\nBDT was based on ideal data while the testing was based on\nthe perturbed data-sets (5%, 10% and 15% perturbation). \n 2.5.3 Artificial Neural Network\nAn Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained through\nthe Pattern Recognition toolbox of the Matlab 2015Rb using\nback-propagation learning algorithm 15–17. The unique set of\n311 ideal chemical SSx were used during the training of the\nANNs. The training set consisted of 5 identical replicas for\neach  of  the  unique  311  chemicals  (for  a  total  of  1555\ntraining  patterns)  in  order  to  accommodate  a  random\nselection of the cross-validation and testing sets. The 1555\ntraining patterns  were randomly partitioned  into  70% for\ntraining,  15%  for  cross-validation  and  15%  for  testing.\nNumerous ANNs were trained and tested for selection of the\noptimal  number  of  hidden  neurons.  Our  investigation\nconcluded  20  neurons  as  the  optimal  number  of  hidden\nneurons.  The  final  trained  ANN  model  exhibited  cross-\nentropy results of: 4.4 for the training set, 12.7 for the cross-\nvalidation set, and 12.7 for the testing set. These outcomes\ncorrespond to: 0% error for the training set, 2.1% error for\nthe validation set and 2.1% for the testing set. \nTo test the performance of the network with unknown data,\nthe 31,100 simulated patient-data were used as inputs for the\nANN trained with ideal chemical data. \n 3  Results and Discussion\n 3.1 Database look-up (WISER)\nThe results of WISER database look-up approach are shown\nin Table 1 and exhibit a reasonable correlation to the binary\ndistribution model shown in Equation 2. The rapid decay in\nperformance  of  WISER  is  easily  expected.  We  use  the\nresults of WISER as the basis of comparison since it is the\nmost prominent and existing mechanism. \nTable 1: Prediction accuracy results from WISER testing using \n31,100 simulated patient-data perturbed at 5%, 10% and 15%.\nData-set Prediction\nAccuracy\nMax Min\n5% Perturbed 1.8% 7% 0%\n10% Perturbed 2.3x10-2% 1% 0%\n15% Perturbed 0.0% 0% 0%\nFigure 5: The Kernel Density Estimations from testing WISER \nwith 31,100 simulated patient-data perturbed at 5%, 10% and 15%\n 3.2 Binary Decision Tree\nTesting results for BDT are shown in Table 2. In this table\nthe first columns represent the severity of the perturbation\nand  the  second  column  corresponds  to  the  classification\naccuracy of the BDT. The third and fourth columns of Table\n2 list the minimum and maximum performance across all of\nthe  311  chemical  substances.  To  better  understand  the\nperformance of the BDT across the entire ensemble of 311\nchemicals, a probability density function was created using\nthe Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) technique 15,18. Figure\n6 illustrates  the statistics for BDT classification behavior\nover the entire 100 representatives of each 311 chemicals.\nThe nearly Gaussian distribution of the statics  indicate a\nvery well behaved system without any particular bias. \nAnother important factor to monitor during the construction\nof  a  BDT  is  the  topology  of  the  final  tree.  Figure  7\nillustrates the topology of the final tree (in the interest of\nsimplicity the labels are omitted), which indicates a very\nwell  balanced  tree  of  depth  9.  This  depth  is  in  perfect\ntheoretical agreement with the complexity of the problem,\nserving  as  another  indication  of  a  successful  training\nsession. \nTable 2: Prediction accuracy results for Binary Decision Tree \n(BDT) testing using 31,100 simulated patient-data perturbed at \n5%, 10% and 15%.\nData-set Prediction\nAccuracy\nMax Min\n5% Perturbed 64.9% 81% 53%\n10% Perturbed 41.8% 54% 27%\n15% Perturbed 25.6% 40% 13%\nFigure 6.The Kernel Density Estimations from testing the Binary \nDecision Tree (BDT) model with 31,100 simulated patient-data \nperturbed at 5%, 10% and 15%.\nFigure 7.Static binary decision tree for 311 unique chemicals found\nin the National Library of Medicine’s Hazardous Substances Data \nBank (HSDB).\n 3.3 Artificial Neural Networks\nThe evaluation results of the ANN are shown in Table  3.\nSimilar to the results of BDT, the first two columns of this\ntable  indicate  the  severity  of  perturbation  and  outcome\naccuracy, while columns three and four indicate the range of\nthe  outcomes  across  all  311  chemicals.  Remarkably  the\naccuracy of BDT and ANN appear to be similar, while the\nrange of ANN's performance exhibit a larger variation. To\nbetter understand the statistics of ANN's results, probability\ndensity profiles  were created  for each  of the  experiment\nusing KDE using the exact parameters as the BDT (identical\nkernels).  Similar  to  BDT,  the  Gaussian  nature  of  the\noutcomes  indicate  a  well  behaved  and  unbiased  system.\nVisual inspection of Figure 8 confirms the noted differences\nin variation of outcomes compared to the BDT results. \nTable 3: Prediction accuracy results for the Artificial Neural \nNetwork (ANN) testing using 31,100 simulated patient-data \nperturbed at 5%, 10% and 15%.\nData-set Prediction\nAccuracy\nMax Min\n5% Perturbed 67.2% 96% 28%\n10% Perturbed 38.4% 73% 10%\n15% Perturbed 21.4% 49% 3%\nFigure 8.The Kernel Density Estimations from testing the Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN) model with 31,100 simulated patient-data \nperturbed at 5%, 10% and 15%.\n 3.4 Dimensional reduction\nTo  optimize  the  Artificial  Neural  Network  model,  we\nexamined the number of hidden neurons being used during\nthe training phase of the model  development.  10  models\nwere  trained,  each  with  a  different  number  of  hidden\nneurons starting with 10 hidden neurons, then incrementing\nby 10 and the final model using 100 hidden neurons. After\nthe  model  was  created,  additional  testing  was  performed\nusing the 5% perturbed data-set and the amount of error\nfrom the ANN was recorded. As seen in Figure 9, the results\nshow that as we increase the number of hidden neurons, the\namount of error from the ANN is reduced with the minimal\namount of error being 15.4% at 100 hidden neurons. We\nthen examined training the ANN with only the first 40 SSx\ninstead  of  the  complete  database  of  79  SSx.  Again  10\nmodels  were  trained  starting  with  10  hidden  neurons  at\nincrements of 10 to 100 hidden neurons. After training the\nANN, additional testing was also performed using the 5%\nperturbed data-set and recording the ANN error. It can be\nseen in Figure  9, the results followed the same pattern as\nwith 79 SSx with the minimal amount of error being 25.8%\nat 40 hidden neurons. This indicates that using the first 40\nSSx  can  reduce  the  amount  of  collected  data  with  an\nacceptable reduction in the classification  rate.  This  small\nreduction  in  classification  can  potentially  be  minimized\nthrough a more informed selection of SSx and analysis of\nthe MCI over the entire cohort of victims.  \nFigure 9: Optimizing the number of hidden neurons used in \ntraining the Artificial Neural Network. We used the 5% perturbed \nsimulated patient-data for additional testing on the model.\n 4 Conclusion\nOur  overall  approach  consisted  of  evaluating  WISER  in\napplication to MCI under more realistic conditions. We have\nused the results of WISER as the basis of comparison to\nhighlight  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  BDT  and\nANN,  two  common  classification  approaches  in  machine\nlearning.  The  summary  of  results  shown  in  Figure  10\nillustrates the significant improved chemical identification\nperformance  that  can  be  obtained  from  BDT  or  ANN\ncompared to WISER. Results reported in section  3.1 (also\nsummarized in Figure 10) reflect the intolerance of WISER\nto erroneous and imperfect data; a condition that is very\nlikely to occur during the chaos and confusion that occurs\nduring an MCI. Furthermore, WISER operates with a luxury\nof reporting a potentially long list of unrelated chemicals\nthat share a common list of present SSx. Presenting a long\nlist of unrelated chemicals may provide additional confusion\nduring  an  MCI.  However,  creating  a  list  of  chemicals\naffords the benefit of operating with fewer SSx. Therefore,\nWISER exhibits the advantage of using as many or as little\nnumber of SSx as are available while BDT and ANN require\na fixed number of SSx in their successful deployment. \nResults for BDT and ANN evaluations reported in sections\n3.2 and  3.3 highlight  the  significant  robustness  of  these\nmore  sophisticated  approaches  compared  to  WISER.  In\nsummary, BDT and ANN show promise when compared to\nWISER  for  quickly  and  accurately  identifying  a  culprit\nchemical during a chemical MCI.  This gain in robustness is\nachieved  through  the  use  of  these  machine-learning\ntechniques' ability to generalize and not simply memorize.\nFurthermore, BDT provides the clear advantage of arriving\nat a single chemical with requiring only 9 SSx (based on the\ndepth of the tree shown in Figure  7). ANN exhibited the\nsame degree of robustness compared to the BDT but with\nthe apparent disadvantage of requiring all 79 SSx during the\nprocess  of  substance  identification.  However  our\nexploration of dimensional reduction and results shown in\nsection 3.4 support the possibility of using only 40 of the 79\nSSx with little reduction in performance.\nOur future investigations will focus on further reduction of\ndata  dimensionality  by  the  use  of  previously  established\nmethods such and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or\nLinear Discriminant Analysis 15 (LDA).  AI tools employed\nduring  chemical  MCIs  could  dramatically  reduce  the\namount of information collected from patients resulting in\nincreased accuracy, precision, and efficiency in identifying\nthe chemical.\nFigure 10.Overall prediction accuracy for each model tested with \n31,100 simulated patient-data perturbed at 5%, 10% and 15%\n 5 Acknowledgments\nThis  study  was  supported  by  the  National  Institutes  of\nHealth/The  National  Library  of  Medicine  grant  number\n5R01LM011648.\n 6 Bibliography\n1.
