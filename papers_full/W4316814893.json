In recent decades, with the development of \ntunnel construction in many countries throughout the world, engineering accidents caused by underground \npipeline damage caused by tunnel construction have been reported  frequently1–4. To deeply analyze the influ-\nence of tunnel construction on adjacent existing pipelines, and put forward a more reliable prediction method \nto provide a strong basis for the design and decision of the actual project, it is of great significance to carry out \na more comprehensive and systematic study on related issues.\nAt present, many scholars at home and abroad have noticed the deformation of existing overburden pipelines \ncaused by tunnel excavation in underground engineering construction, and have carried out detailed research \non this problem, and the main methods used include model  test5–8, numerical  simulation9–11 and theoretical \n analysis12–20. By contrast, the theoretical analysis method can effectively provide guiding opinions for engineer-\ning because of its clear physical concept. In recent years, in terms of theoretical research, Attewell et al. 12 first \nproposed to regard the pipeline as a Winkler foundation beam model, and established the deformation differential \ncontrol equation by assuming that the joint deformation of the pipe and soil and the free settlement of the stratum \nobey the Gaussian distribution, and gave the analytical solution of pipe deformation; Liang et al. 13 established \nthe transverse vibration equation of the pipeline using the two-parameter Pasternak foundation model, and \ndiscussed the influence of the foundation shear stiffness on the stability of the pipeline system; Zhang et al. 14 \nused the continuous elastic analysis method to simulate the stress and displacement response of the continu-\nous pipeline with joints caused by tunnel excavation in multi-layer soil; Klar et al.15,16 considered the nonlinear \ncharacteristics of soil stiffness weakening effect and pipeline-soil interaction caused by tunnel excavation, and \ndeduced the expressions of pipeline deformation and bending moment by using elastic continuity theory; Shi \net al.17 studied the impact of explosion load of adjacent tunnel construction on the safety of pipelines, and based \non the dynamic and static analysis of pipelines, established a method to determine the control standard of peak \nvibration velocity of buried pipelines under explosion load; Zhao et al.18 derived a finite difference model for the \nskewed pipeline deformation, which can consider the influence of shield shell friction and ground loss.\nHowever, most of the above analytical models adopt the elastic foundation beam theory, which assumes that \nthe pipeline is always in close contact with the soil, and the deformation of the pipeline and the soil is coordi -\nnated. In fact, due to the deformation difference between pipeline and soil, the soil in a certain area is separated \nfrom the bottom of the pipeline, and the stress concentration appears in the critical section of the pipeline and \nsoil, which will further aggravate the volume loss of the soil around the pipeline and increase the deformation of \nthe pipeline, thus threatening the safety of the  pipeline19–21. Additionally, several test results show that there is a \nsituation of pipeline-soil  voiding22–25.  Vorster22 analyzed the influence of sand tunnel excavation on the deforma-\ntion of the pipeline through the centrifugal test, showing that there is a void phenomenon at the bottom of the \npipeline.  Marshall23 explored the volume loss law of sand tunnels under different stiffness pipes by centrifuge \ntest and elaborated the mechanism of pipeline-soil interaction in the process of tunnel volume loss, and also \nfound that gaps were formed beneath the pipeline. Cheng et al. 25 carried out centrifugal model test to observe \nthe pipeline-soil void behavior, confirmed the existence of pipeline-soil void phenomenon, and expounded that \nit is necessary to consider pipeline-soil void in the calculation of pipeline deformation. Unfortunately, only few \nliteratures have incorporated the effect of the pipeline-soil void in the existing analytical solutions, such as Lin \net al.26 regarded pipeline and soil as Euler–Bernoulli beam and Pasternak foundation respectively, and pipeline-\nsoil void area as another element, the finite difference method was used to solve the pipeline deformation con -\nsidering the formation of gap and pipeline orientation under the condition of force balance and deformation \ncoordination simultaneously.\nAlthough the above mentioned research is available, the problem of pipeline deformation caused by tunnel \nexcavation has not been well addressed. In view of this, this study expands on previous research by introducing \nthe Pasternak foundation model and semi-infinite beam theory, and establishes the pipeline-soil interaction \nmodel with the void formation. Subsequently, based on the critical condition of the void area and the coordina-\ntion area, the analytical solutions of the pipeline deformation caused by the tunnel excavation and the range of the \npipeline-soil void area are put forward, and the calculation results are compared with the existing test results for \nverifying the proposed method. Finally, the influence of the main factors such as pipeline bending stiffness, soil \nelastic modulus, pipeline-tunnel spacing and formation loss rate on the pipeline deformation and the expansion \nof the void area is discussed for reference in engineering design.\n3\nVol.:(0123456789)Scientific Reports |          (2023) 13:921  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26635-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nDeformation mechanism of pipeline caused by tunnel underpass\nWhen the tunnel passes through the existing pipeline (such as natural gas pipe, municipal pipe, etc.), the overly-\ning soil and the pipeline have a certain amount of deformation, and the relative deformation between the pipeline \nand the tunnel is closely related to the pipeline stiffness. If the pipe stiffness is much greater than the soil stiff -\nness (i.e., the absolute rigid pipe), the surrounding soil deformation is inconsistent with the pipe deformation, \nresulting in the detachment of pipe and soil. On the contrary, if the stiffness of the pipe is close to the soil (i.e., \nthe absolute flexible pipe), the deformation of the pipe is completely consistent with the deformation of the \nsurrounding soil, and the pipe and soil are always in contact. According to the centrifuge test results of Vorster \net al.22, the actual pipe-soil contact situation is between the above two. Thus it can be seen that the pipe-soil \nsystem can be divided into two areas, namely, the void area from the pipe axis to a certain range outside and the \ncoordination zone (coordinated deformation) outside the area, as shown in Fig. 1.\nTunnelling-induced pipeline deformation\nThe tunnel excavation passes through the existing pipeline, which involves the complex tunneling-pipe-soil inter-\naction, so it is difficult to model and solve directly in theory, but the two-stage method can be used to  analyze27. \nIn the first stage, the vertical displacement of soil caused by tunnel excavation at the pipeline axis is calculated \n(ignoring the influence of pipeline); In the second stage, the pipe-soil interaction model is established, the soil \ndeformation caused by the first stage is regarded as the external load, and the obtained free displacement of the \nsoil is applied to the pipeline, the vertical load-bearing deformation balance differential equation of the pipeline \nis established and solved, and then the vertical displacement of the pipeline is obtained. For the convenience of \ncalculation, the following assumptions are made in this study:\n1. Only the situation where the pipeline and the tunnel are perpendicular to each other is considered. Since \nthe lateral soil action of the pipeline is small enough to be ignored compared with the vertical action, so it \nis regarded as a plane strain problem;\n2. Both the pipeline and the soil are continuous homogeneous bodies, and the section size change caused by \nthe pipeline deformation is ignored;\n3. The pipeline is only affected by the displacement load of the stratum and the gravity of the overlying soil, \nand the influence of other loads during construction is ignored.\nElastic foundation model. In the previous two-stage method for the effect of tunnel excavation on the \ndeformation of the overlying pipeline, a reasonable foundation beam model was used in the second stage to \nsimulate the interaction between the pipeline and the soil. Among them, the Winkler elastic foundation beam \nmodel is widely used because of its simplicity and clear physical meaning, but this model also has obvious \ndefects, that is, it does not consider the continuity of the foundation soil deformation, and ignores the influence \nof shear force transfer in the soil on the calculation results, resulting in a certain error between the calculated \nvalue and the measured result.\nComparing with the Winkler foundation model, the Pasternak foundation model connects the spring ele-\nments in the Winkler foundation through a shear layer that only produces transverse shear deformation, and \nconsiders the shear interaction between independent springs (see Fig.  2). The Pasternak foundation model is \nwidely used to study soil-structure interaction because it considers the continuity of soil deformation and is \nmore in line with the actual engineering situation. Therefore, this model is also used to simulate the pipeline-soil \ninteraction in this study. As shown in Fig.  3, converting the soil displacement equivalently into the additional \nload acting on the pipeline,  Pasternak28 gave the expression of q(x) as\nFigure 1.  Mechanical model of pipe-soil interaction based on detachment phenomenon.\n4\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |          (2023) 13:921  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26635-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nwhere x = lateral horizontal distance from the tunnel axis; q(x) = distributed load acting on the pipeline at coor-\ndinate x, which is caused by strata subsidence; G  = Pasternak foundation reaction coefficient; S (x) = ground \nsettlement at coordinate x; k = coefficient of subgrade reaction.\nAnalysis model of pipeline deformation. According to the above ideas, the vertical free displacement \nof soil caused by tunnel excavation can be calculated first. Based on a large number of engineering examples, \n Peck29 found that the ground settlement perpendicular to the tunnel axis direction caused by stratum loss during \ntunnel excavation roughly conforms to the Gaussian curve distribution\nwhere S0(x) = ground surface settlement at coordinate x; R = tunnel radius; ε = formation loss rate caused by tun-\nnel excavation; i0 = width coefficient of surface settlement trough.\nConsidering the pipeline is buried at the underground depth z , the depth correction is required due to the \nwidth of settlement trough is different from that at the  surface30, so the above Eq. (2) can be modified as\nwhere z0, z = buried depth of tunnel and pipeline respectively; i(z) = width of surface settlement trough at depth z; \nn = influence coefficient related to tunnel radius and soil conditions, which typically falls in the range of 0.35–0.85 \nand 0.85–1.0 for cohesive soil and sandy soil, respectively.\nThe vertical free displacement of soil at the point of pipeline axis (x, z) is calculated by coupling Eqs. (1) and \n(2) as\nLet Smax (z) = π R 2ε√\n2π i(z) , wherein Smax(z) = maximum ground settlement above the tunnel axis at depth z.\nFor the calculation of pipeline deformation caused by vertical displacement of the ground, the key point is \nto simulate the interaction between a buried pipeline and the surrounding soil.

Considering geometric and loading symmetry, \njust the right-half of the infinite beam (see Fig.  1) is selected for analysis, and the differential control equation \nof vertical deflection of pipeline should be expressed  as31\nwhere w(x) = vertical deflection of pipeline at coordinate x; DP = outer diameter of the pipeline; Ep = elastic modu-\nlus of pipeline; Ip = section moment of inertia; G = Pasternak foundation shear stiffness.\nWhen analyzing the pipeline-soil interaction, Yu et al.32 introduced the modified foundation reaction coef-\nficient k to consider the buried depth effect as\nwhere η = depth correction factor calculated by η =\n{ 2.18 z/Dp ≤ 0.5\n1 + 1\n1.7z/D p z/Dp > 0.5 ; Es, vs = elastic modulus and Pois-\nson’s ratio of soil respectively.\nTanahashi et al.33 suggested the Pasternak foundation shear stiffness G for solving the static problem of infinite \nbeam on elastic foundation be expressed as follows\nwhere ψ t = 3\n2γp Ht\nsinh (γp Ht)cosh (γp Ht)−γp Ht\nsinh2 (γp Ht)  ; Ht = thickness of foundation shear layer; γ p = empirical parameter. \nIn the calculation, generally take Ht = 10DP and γp = 0.7  m-1.\nSubstituting Eqs. (1) and (5)−(7) into Eq. (4) will get\nTake any point ξ [ξ ∈ (− ∞, + ∞)] on the axis of the pipeline, the length of the micro-segment at ξ  is dξ, then \nthe additional load acting on this segment is q (ξ)dξ, and the vertical deflection w 0 at any point x on the axis of \nthe pipeline caused by the micro-segment load q(ξ)dξ  is34\nwhere dw (x) = mq (ξ )d(ξ )\n4EpIpαβ (α 2+β 2)e−α |x−ξ| , m = (β cos β |x− ξ|+ α sinβ |x− ξ|) , α =\n√√\nKD P\n4EpIp + GD P\n4EpIp  , \nβ =\n√√\nKD P\n4EpIp − GD P\n4EpIp .\nFurther, the derivative of Eq. (9) is used to calculate the rotation angle θ0(x), the bending moment M0(x) and \nthe shear force Q0(x) at any point x of the infinite beam.\nHowever, the assumption of the infinite beam model is that there is soil support under any area of the \npipeline. Actually, the void may occur beneath the pipeline during the generation of tunnel volume losses, so \nthe the above solution does not conform to the assumption of the model, and the load difference caused by the \nvoid between the pipeline and the soil should be considered in the calculation. With respect to the situation of \nthe void between pipe and soil shown in Fig.  1, this study adopts the following ideas for analysis: assume that \nthe width of the cavity area in Fig.  4 is 2a, and divide the pipeline-soil interaction into void area (i.e. BC) and \ncoordination area (AB or CD), and regard the coordination area as a semi-infinite beam of Pasternak elastic \nfoundation and the void area as a double-ended fixed beam, which meets the continuous conditions of internal \nforce and displacement at the interface of the two areas.\nCalculation of pipeline deformation in coordination area. As can be seen from Fig. 4, taking the segment CD of \nthe coordination area on the right part of the pipeline as the analysis object, whose response is affected by the \ndistributed load q(x) caused by ground settlement, the concentrated load QC and the concentrated moment MC \nof the point C. Under the assumption of small deformation, the superposition method can be used to calculate \nthe internal force and deformation of the segment CD on the right side of the pipeline. According to the super-\nposition principle, the vertical deflection w(x) of the pipeline in the coordination area is\nwhere w1(x), w2(x) and w3(x) = vertical deformation of semi-infinite beam caused by QC and Mc and q(x), respec-\ntively. Notice that in the following calculation process, it is assumed that the bending moment is positive with \nthe lower part of the beam is tensioned, the shear force is positive in the clockwise direction, and the deflection \nis positive in the vertical downward direction.\nWhen calculating w1(x) and w2(x), the general solution of the vertical displacement differential equation [i.e., \nEq. (8)] of the pipeline axis is obtained first.

Moreover, due to the rotation during the deformation of the pipeline, it \nis assumed that the fixed support has an initial rotation angle θC (or θB) during the calculation process. In order \nto facilitate formula derivation, a new coordinate system x’ − y’ is established, with point B on the pipeline axis \nas the coordinate origin, and the transformation relationship between the new and old coordinate systems is \nx’ = x + a, y’ = y.\nAccording to the structural mechanics, the vertical deflection of the pipeline void area BC at any point x’  is36\nThe bending moment at the point x’ = 2a is calculated by deriving Eq. (18),\nwhere Sc = vertical displacement of soil at point C in the coordination area. The deformation of the pipeline and \nthe soil at point C is always consistent, namely,\nwhere wC = vertical deflection at point C of the pipeline in the void area.\nDetermination of the range of pipeline-soil void area. According to the flowchart shown in Fig.  7, \nthe following trial calculation method can be used to determine the width 2a of void area: (1) by combining \nEqs. (3) and (9), the vertical displacement w0(x) at the axis of the pipeline and the stratum settlement S(x) at the \nburied depth of the pipeline are calculated respectively, and solve the difference S rel(x) = w0(x) − S(x); (2) judge \nwhether there is an a 0 to satisfy S rel(a0) = 0 based on the iterative method, if a 0 does not exist, the deformation \nbetween the full length of the pipe and the soil is considered to be coordinated, and the deformation result of \nthe infinite beam can be directly output as the deformation of the pipeline, i.e. w(x) = w0(x); conversely, if there is \nsuch a a0, the pipeline-soil detachment is considered to occur at a certain critical point C (or B), and try to take \na = a0; from the contents of “ Calculation of pipeline deformation in coordination area” and “Determination of \n(18)w\n(\nx′)\n= 1\nEpIp\n−\n( q\n24x′4 − qa\n6 x′3 + qa2\n6 x′2\n)\n+ θC\n2a x′2 − θcx′ + Sc\n(19)M |x′=2a = −θC EpIp − 1\n3qa3\na\n(20)SC = wC\nFigure 7.

To verify the proposed analytical method, the deformation and bending moment \nof the pipeline predicted by this method and other analytical methods are compared with the experimental \nresults of the centrifuge model test of the tunnel excavation beneath the existing pipeline in sandy stratum. \nThe centrifugal acceleration of the test is 60 g, and the other dimensions and characteristics of the model are \nas follows: Dp = 31.75 ×  10−3 m, L = 1.15 m, Ep = 69GPa, Ip = 2.1439 ×  10-8m4, z = 0.096 m, R = 0.05 m, z0 = 0.25 m, \nγs = 15.4kN/m3, Es = 10 MPa, vs = 0.3. It should be noted that in order to avoid systematic errors in the calculation \nresults of the pipeline caused by the empirical selection of the stratigraphic parameters, the stratigraphic defor-\nmation S(x) is directly selected from the fitted curve obtained from the measured values of the free settlement of \nthe strata at the location of the pipeline axis depth in the  literature8, where Smax(z) = 0.84 ×  10−3 m, i(z) = 0.1225 m.\nFigure 8 shows the comparison of the results of the pipeline responses (in terms of deflection and bending \nmoment) for the analytical method of this study and Lin et al. 26 as well as the experimental test, and also gives \nthe calculation results of Lin et al.26 without considering the detachment of pipeline and soil. It can be seen that \nthe calculated values in this study is in good agreement with the experimental values and the estimated values \nof Lin et al. The maximum deflections of the pipeline is slightly larger than the calculated values of Lin et al., but \nthe maximum bending moment of the pipeline is closer to the experimental value. The comparison results can \nverify the reliability of the method in this study.\nLaboratory model test. Wang et al.37 conducted the large-scale model tests to simulate the effects of ver-\ntical underpass tunnel construction in sandy soils on the deformation of existing pipelines. The dimensions \nand characteristics of the model are as follows: D p = 0.2 m, L = 2 m, Ep = 2.3GPa, Ip = 4.637 ×  10-5m4, z = 0.75 m, \nγs = 14.7kN/m3, Es = 2.5 MPa, vs = 0.3, Smax(z) = 8.795 ×  10−3 m, i(z) = 0.2993 m. In this test, the movement of the \nsliding plate at the bottom of the model box was used to simulate the Gaussian settlement curve caused by tunnel \nexcavation, and the settlement rod was set to measure the deformation of the pipeline and the free deformation \nof the stratum around the depth of the pipeline axis.\nFigure 9 shows the comparison of the results of the pipeline deformation for the analytical method of this \nstudy and Lin et al. 26, and also provides the calculated results of Lin et al. 26 without void area. It can be seen \nthat the trend of measured pipeline deflection is relatively consistent with the calculated value. However, for the \npipeline segment x ≥ 4DP, there are certain differences between the experimental data and the calculated value \nof Lin et al. 26, but the calculated results of the proposed method are more consistent with the experimental \nresults. Additionally, from the test results, a void area with half width of the settlement through of about 0.33 m \nis formed beneath the pipeline, which is consistent with a  = 0.32 m calculated by the proposed method, which \nfurther verifies the rationality of the theoretical assumption and derivation process in this study.\nField test. Jia et al.9 conducted settlement observation on the construction process of the underpass cable \npipeline in the first phase of Shenzhen Metro project, and the test pipeline was located in the sandy clay. In this \nstudy, the monitoring results of pipeline deformation after the excavation of the left line tunnel are adopted for \nverification. The dimensions and characteristics of the model are as follows: D p = 3 m, L = 100 m, Ep = 25GPa, \nIp = 1.7329m4, z = 8.7 m, R = 3 m, z0 = 14.4 m, γs = 15.57kN/m3, Es = 8.2 MPa, vs = 0.3, Smax(z) = 0.012185 ×  10−3 m, \ni(z) = 6.48 m.\nFigure 10 shows the comparison between the calculation results from the proposed method and Lin et al. 26 \nand the field test data. Through the calculation, it is found that there is no void area at the bottom of the pipeline, \nwhich is due to the larger buried depth of the pipeline and the larger displacement load of the overlying soil \nrelative to the stratum, which makes the central deformation of the pipeline larger and is easy to contact with the \nsoil beneath the pipeline. As can be seen from Fig. 10, the calculation results in this study is in good agreement \nwith the observed value, and their deviation is smaller than that of the calculation method from Lin et al. 26, so \nit can be seen that this method is also suitable for sandy clay.\nParametric investigation\nIn order to discuss the influence of the changes of main physical parameters on the deformation of the pipeline \nconsidering the void effect, the following examples are used for comparative analysis. Tunnel calculation parame-\nters: z0=15 m, R = 3 m, ε = 3%; pipeline calculation parameters: DP = 1.9 m, z = 4.8 m, Ep = 69GPa, Ip = 3.19 ×  10-1m4; \nsoil calculation parameters: Es = 10 MPa, vs = 0.3, γs = 15.4kN/m3.\n10\nVol:.(1234567890)Scientific Reports |          (2023) 13:921  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26635-8\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6\n0.0010\n0.0008\n0.0006\n0.0004\n0.0002\n0.0000Pipe deflection, w(x)/m\nDistance from tunnel axis, x/m\n This study\n Lin et al. 2020(with void)\n Lin et al. 2020(without void)\n Observed pipeline deflection\n(a) pipeline deflection\n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.00 .2 0.4 0.6\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80Pipeline bending moment, M /N·m\nDistance from tunnel axis, x/m\n This study\n Lin et al. 2020(with void)\n Lin et al. 2020(without void)\n Observed pipeline bending moment\n(b) pipeline bending moment\nFigure 8.

Figure 11 shows the pipeline deflection curve when pipeline bending \nstiffness EpIp is 0.958 ×  107 KN  m2, 1.916 ×  107 KN  m2, 3.353 ×  107 KN  m2 and 5.748 ×  107 KN  m2. It can be seen \nthat as the bending stiffness of the pipeline increases, the pipeline deflection gradually decreases, and the propor-\ntion of reduction gradually decreases. The reason is that the bending stiffness of the pipeline directly affects its \nability to bear the ground load and resist bending deformation, that is to say, the greater its stiffness, the stronger \nits ability to share the load, so that the pipeline can deform less in the process of pipeline-soil interaction.\nSoil elastic modulus Es. Figure 12 shows the deflection curve of the pipeline with the elastic modulus \nof soil E s of 5 MPa, 10 MPa, 20 MPa and 30 MPa respectively. It can be seen that with the increase of elastic \nmodulus, the deflection of pipeline decreases gradually, but the decrease rate is less than that of pipeline bending \nstiffness (by comparing Figs. 10 and 11). Obviously, the elastic modulus of soil Es affects the pipeline deflection \nmainly by changing the foundation parameters k and G. From the parameters k and G in Eqs. (6) and (7), it is \nknown that the parameters k and G increase with the increase of elastic modulus, so as to enhance the ability \nof soil to resist deformation. Additionally, it can be seen from Eq. (8) that the increase of k and G results in the \ngradual decrease of the load q(x) acting on the pipeline caused by the formation settlement, which is also the \nreason for the reduction of the pipeline deflection.\nPipeline-tunnel spacing ratio ZT/DP. In order to simplify the analysis, the normalized parameter ZT/DP \nis used to represent the pipeline-tunnel spacing ratio, wherein ZT = distance from pipeline axis to tunnel axis.\nFigure 13 shows the pipeline deflection curves with Z T/DP of 4, 5, 5.5 and 6 respectively. It can be seen that \nwith the increase of the pipeline-tunnel spacing ratio, the maximum deflection of the pipeline decreases, and \n-30- 25 -20- 15 -10- 50 51 01 52 02 53 0\n0.010\n0.008\n0.006\n0.004\n0.002\n0.000\nPipe deformation, w(x)/m\nDistance from tunnel axis, x/m\n This study\n Lin et al. 2020\n Observed pipeline deformation\nFigure 10.

The main reason is that when the distance between pipeline and tunnel \nincreases, the pipeline are less affected by tunnel excavation, and the stratum deformation at the depth of the \npipeline axis caused by the loss of tunnel excavation also decreases, which in turn causes the formation deforma-\ntion load borne by the pipeline is correspondingly reduced, thereby reducing the pipeline deflection.\nFormation loss rate ε. Figure 14 shows the pipeline deflection curve with the formation loss rate ε of 2%, \n2.5%, 3% and 4% respectively. It can be seen that the influence of formation loss on pipeline deflection is more \nsignificant than the above three factors. The reason is that the formation loss rate is directly related to the ground \nsettlement. With the increase of formation loss rate, the deflection of pipeline axis increases obviously. For exam-\nple, when ε increases from 2 to 4%, the deflection of pipeline axis increases by 65.6%. It can be explained that \nthe formation loss rate ε affects the pipeline deflection by changing the free subsidence of strata, which shows \nthat the larger ε is, the greater the ground settlement at the axis of the pipeline is, so the greater the stratum \nload acting on the pipeline is, and the greater the pipeline deformation is. This phenomenon is consistent with \nthe conclusion of Franza et al. 38 based on the two-stage analysis method of continuum that “the volume loss \nof tunnel will be accompanied by the formation of void gap, and may lead to the nonlinear trend of structural \ndeformation” .\nDiscussion on the range of the void area\nAs can be seen from the aforementioned verification section, the maximum difference in the calculated pipeline \ndeflection between the two cases of considering the pipeline-soil void and not considering the pipeline-soil void \nis 20%, so it is important to consider the pipeline-soil voiding phenomenon to calculate the pipeline deformation \n-0.6 -0.4 -0.2 0.0 0.2 0.40 .6\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0.00Pipeline deformation, w(x)/m\nDistance from tunnel axis, x/m\nEs=5MPa\nEs=10MPa\nEs=20MPa\nEs=30MPa\nFigure 12.

Moreover, the range of void area will be affected by material parameters such as pipeline stiffness, \nelastic modulus of soil and geometric parameters such as pipeline-tunnel spacing. For this reason, this study will \nfurther compare and analyze the factors that affect the scope of the void area.\nTo compare the extent of detachment between pipeline and soil in the void area more intuitively, the nor -\nmalization parameter is defined, i.e., R r,max=(Smax − wmax)/Smax, wherein Smax, wmax are the free subsidence of the \nstratum in the buried depth of the pipeline and the maximum pipeline deflection, respectively; Rr,max is the ratio \nof the relative maximum displacement between the pipeline and the surrounding soil to the maximum soil \ndisplacement, indicates the relative magnitude of the pipeline-soil displacement difference.\nPipeline bending stiffness EPIP. Select the calculation results of 26 groups of different pipeline bending \nstiffness EPIP, and draw the relationship curves of Rr,max versus a and Rr,max versus EPIP, as shown in Fig. 15. It can \nbe seen that a and Rr,max are approximately exponentially related to EPIP, the growth of a increases gradually with \nthe increase of EPIP but becomes gentle, and Rr,max tends to grow steadily. This shows that the extent of pipeline-\nsoil detachment increases with the increase of pipeline stiffness, but when the stiffness increases to a certain \namount, its impact on the void section gradually decreases. The reason is that when the pipeline EpIp increases, \nthe relative stiffness of the pipeline and the soil increases, making it easier for uncoordinated deformation to \noccur between the pipeline and the soil. Meanwhile, due to the pipeline in the void area is only considered to \nbe subject to the self-weight of the overlying soil layer, the increase of the pipeline stiffness makes the pipeline \ndeflections in the void area decrease, while the relative displacement ratio Rr,max at the midpoint of the void area \nof pipeline increases significantly, that is to say, the extent of pipeline-soil detachment increases.\nSoil elastic modulus Es. Select the calculation results 15 groups of different soil elastic modulus Es, and \ndraw the relationship curves of Rr,max versus a and Rr,max versus Es, as shown in Fig.  16.

This \nshows that increasing the elastic modulus of soil may cause an appropriate increase in the void width, but the \nextent of detachment between pipeline and soil is reduced, which is conducive to the safety of the pipeline. Obvi-\nously, increasing the elastic modulus of the soil is equivalent to reducing the stiffness difference between pipeline \nand soil, which is conducive to the coordinated deformation of the two.\nPipeline-tunnel spacing ratio ZT/DP. Select the calculation results of 14 groups of different pipeline-\ntunnel spacing ratios ZT/DP, and draw the relationship curves of Rr,max versus a and Rr,max versus ZT/DP, as shown \nin Fig. 17. It can be seen that a increases with the increase of ZT/DP, and the increasing trend is gradually obvious, \nwhich is caused by the decrease of the width i(z) of the settlement trough, but R r,max is the opposite trend. That \nis, when the pipeline is close to the tunnel axis, the maximum deformation of the stratum increases significantly, \nand the deformation of the center of the pipeline is much less than the deformation of the stratum, which shows \nthat the detachment extent of pipeline and soil is high, and the impact on the safety of the pipeline is intensified.\nLimitations\nThis study assumes that the pipeline is not affected by lateral earth pressure, and only considers that it is affected \nby the ground displacement load and the gravity of the overlying soil, and in the actual project, the pipeline will \nalso be affected by the construction caused by tunnel excavation and the structure of the soil. The mechanism of \npipe-soil interaction is more complex, and it is not simply to apply displacement load on the pipeline. In addi-\ntion, the Peck empirical formula is used to calculate the stratum displacement in this study, it is assumed that the \nfoundation soil is a homogeneous isotropic linear elastic body in semi-infinite space, but in practical engineering, \nthe foundation soil is anisotropic, stratified and elastic–plastic. Furthermore, the formation displacement has \nthree-dimensional characteristics, which should include both vertical and horizontal displacement, but only the \nvertical displacement is considered in this study.\n05 10 15 20 25 30 35\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\n0.16\nThis study (a value)\nThis study (Rr,max value)\n Fitting curve (a value)\n Fitting curve (Rr,max value)\nSoil elastic modulus, Es/MPa\nHalf width of void area, a/m\n6.0x10\n-4\n6.5x10\n-4\n7.0x10\n-4\n7.5x10\n-4\n8.0x10\n-4\n8.5x10\n-4\nRr,max\nFigure 16.

The main conclusions are as follows:\n1. By considering the pipeline-soil void, the deflection of the pipeline is reduced, while the conventional cal -\nculation method that does not consider the pipeline-soil void is conservative.\n2. The maximum deflection of pipeline increases with the increase of formation loss rate, and decreases with \nthe increase of the pipeline-tunnel spacing, the pipeline bending stiffness and the soil elastic modulus, but \ntheir decreasing rate slows down with the increase of these parameters;\n3. The range of void area increases with the increase of the pipeline bending stiffness, the soil elastic modulus \nand the pipeline-tunnel spacing, and the extent of pipeline-soil detachment increases with the increase of \nthe pipeline bending stiffness, but decreases with the increase of the soil elastic modulus and the pipeline-\ntunnel spacing.\nData availability\nThe data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable \nrequest.\nReceived: 23 August 2022; Accepted: 19 December 2022\nReferences\n 1.
