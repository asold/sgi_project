Examplesof“vertical”LLMsareGPT3\n(Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al.,\n2022) and Bloom (BigScience et al., 2022). In this\npaper, we createGlot500-m, a model that instead\nfocuses on scaling multilingual LLMshorizontally,\ni.e.,scalingtoalargenumberoflanguagesthegreat\n*Equal contribution.\nmajority of which is low-resource. As LLMs are\nessentialforprogressinNLP,lackofLLMssupport-\ninglow-resourcelanguagesisaseriousimpediment\ntobringingNLPto allof theworld’slanguagesand\ncultures. Our goal is to address this need with the\ncreation of Glot500-m.1\nExisting multilingual LLMs support only about\n100(Conneauetal.,2020)outofthe7000languages\nof the world. These supported languages are the\nones for which large amounts of training data are\navailable through projects such as Oscar (Suárez\net al., 2019) and the Wikipedia dumps.2 Following\nSiddhantetal.(2022),werefertothe100languages\ncovered by XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) ashead\nlanguagesand to the remaining languages astail\nlanguages. This terminology is motivated by the\nskewed distribution of available data per language:\nfor the best-resourced languages there are huge\ncorpora available, but for the long tail of languages,\nonly small corpora exist. This is a key problem we\naddress: the availability of data for tail languages\nis limited compared to head languages. As a result,\ntail languages have often been ignored by language\ntechnologies (Joshi et al., 2020).\nAlthough there exists some work on machine\ntranslation for a large number of tail languages\n(Costa-jussà et al., 2022; Bapna et al., 2022), ex-\nisting LLMs for tail languages are limited to a\nrelatively small number of languages (Wang et al.,\n2019; Alabi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). In this\npaper,weaddressthisgap. Ourworkhasthreeparts.\n(i) Corpus collection. We collectGlot2000-c, a\ncorpus covering thousands of tail languages. (ii)\nModel training. Using Glot500-c, a subset of\nGlot2000-c,wetrain Glot500-m,anLLMcovering\n511 languages. (iii)Validation. We conduct an\nextensive evaluation of the quality ofGlot500-m’s\n1In concurrent work, Adebara et al.

The resulting dataset\nGlot2000-c comprises 700GB in 2266 languages\ncollected from≈150 sources. After cleaning and\ndeduplication, we create the subsetGlot500-c, con-\nsisting of 511 languages and 534language-scripts\n(where we define a language-script as a combina-\ntion of ISO 639-33 and script) to trainGlot500-m.\nOur criterion for including a language-script in\nGlot500-cis that it includes more than 30,000 sen-\ntences.\nModeltraining. Totrain Glot500-m,weemploy\nvocabulary extension and continued pretraining.\nXLM-R’s vocabulary is extended with new tokens\ntrained onGlot500-c. We then perform continued\npretraining of XLM-R with the MLM objective\n(Devlin et al., 2019).\nValidation. We comprehensively evaluate\nGlot500-m on a diverse suite of natural language\nunderstanding, sequence labeling and multilingual\ntasksforhundredsoflanguages. Theresultsdemon-\nstrate thatGlot500-m performs better than XLM-\nR-B (XLM-R-base) for tail languages by a large\nmarginwhileperformingcomparably(orbetter)for\nhead languages.\nPrevious work on multilinguality has been hin-\ndered by the lack of LLMs supporting a large num-\nber of languages. This limitation has led to studies\nbeing conducted in settings dissimilar from real-\nworld scenarios. For example, Dufter and Schütze\n(2020) use synthetic language data. And the curse\nof multilinguality has been primarily studied for\na set of high-resource languages (Conneau et al.,\n2020). By creatingGlot500-m, we can investigate\nthese issues in a more realistic setting. We make\ncode, data and trained models available to foster\nresearch by the community on how to include hun-\ndreds of languages that are currently ill-served by\nNLP technology.\nContributions. (i) We train the multilingual\nmodel Glot500-m on a600GB corpus, covering\nmore than 500 diverse languages, and make it pub-\nlicly available athttps://github.com/cisnlp/\nGlot500. (ii) We collect and cleanGlot500-c, a\ncorpus that covers these diverse languages and al-\n3https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639\nlows us to trainGlot500-m, and will make as much\nofitpubliclyavailableaspossible. (iii)Weevaluate\nGlot500-monpseudoperplexityandonfivediverse\ntasks across these languages. We observe large im-\nprovements for low-resource languages compared\nto an XLM-R baseline. (iv) Our extensive analysis\nshows that no single factor explains the quality of\nmultilingual LLM representations. Rather, a com-\nbination of factors determines quality including\ncorpus size, script, “help” from related languages\nand the total capacity of the model. (v) Our work\naddresses an important goal of NLP research: we\nshould not limit NLP to a relatively small number\nof high-resource languages and instead strive to\nsupport as many languages as possible to bring the\nbenefits of NLP to all languages and cultures.\n2 Related Work\nTraining multilingual LLMs using the masked lan-\nguage modeling (MLM) objective is effective to\nachieve cross-lingual representations (Devlin et al.,\n2019; Conneau et al., 2020). These models can be\nfurther improved by incorporating techniques such\nasdiscriminativepre-training(Chietal.,2022)and\ntheuseofparalleldata(Yangetal.,2020;Chietal.,\n2021). However, this primarily benefits a limited\nset of languages with large corpora.\nRecent research has attempted to extend exist-\ning LLMs to languages with limited resources.\nWang et al. (2019) propose vocabulary extension;\nEbrahimi and Kann (2021) investigate adaptation\nmethods, including MLM and Translation Lan-\nguageModel(TLM)objectivesandadapters;Alabi\netal.(2022)adaptXLM-Rto17Africanlanguages;\nWang et al. (2022) expand language models to\nlow-resource languages using bilingual lexicons.\nAlternatively, parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nadapts pre-trained models to new languages by\ntraining a small set of weights effectively (Zhao\netal.,2020;Pfeifferetal.,2021;Anselletal.,2022).\nPfeiffer et al. (2022) address the “curse of multilin-\nguality” by sharing a part of the model among all\nlanguagesandhavingseparatemodulesforeachlan-\nguage. We show that the common perception that\nmultilingualityincreasesasweaddmorelanguages,\nuntil, fromsomepoint, itstartsdecreasing, isnaive.\nThe amount of available data per language and the\nsimilarity between languages also play important\nroles (§6.8).\nAnother approach trains LLMs from scratch for\nalimitednumberoftaillanguages;e.g.,AfriBERTa\n1083\n(Oguejietal.,2021a)andIndicNLPSuite(Kakwani\netal.,2020)areLLMsfor11Africanlanguagesand\n11 Indic languages. In concurrent work, Adebara\net al. (2022) train a multilingual model for 517\nAfrican languages on a 42 GB corpus, but without\nmaking the model available and with an evaluation\non a smaller number of languages than ours.\nClosely related to our work on corpus creation,\nBapna et al. (2022) and Costa-jussà et al. (2022)\nalsocreateNLPresourcesforalargenumberoftail\nlanguages. They train a language identifier model\nandextracttextualdatafortaillanguagesfromlarge-\nscale web crawls. This approach is effective, but\nit requires significant computational resources and\nnative speakers for all tail languages. This is hard\nto do outside of large corporations. Bapna et al.\n(2022) have not made their data available. Costa-\njussà et al. (2022) have only released a portion of\ntheir data in around 200 languages.\nA key benefit of “horizontally” scaled multilin-\ngual LLMs is transfer from high- to low-resource\nlanguages. Ourevaluationsuggeststhat Glot500-m\nexcels at this, but this is not the main focus of our\npaper. There is a large body of work on crosslin-\ngual transfer: (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019; Imani-\nGooghari et al., 2022; Lauscher et al., 2020; Con-\nneau et al., 2020; Turc et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2021;\nSeverini et al., 2022; Choenni and Shutova, 2022;\nWang et al., 2023), inter alia.\n3 Glot2000-c\n3.1 Data Collection\nOne of the major challenges in developing NLP\ntechnologies for tail languages is the scarcity of\nhigh-qualitytrainingdata. Inthiswork,wepropose\na lightweight methodology that is easily replicable\nfor academic labs. We identify tail language data\npreviouslypublishedbyresearchers,publishersand\ntranslators and then crawl or download them. By\ncrawling a few websites and compiling data from\naround 150 different datasets, we amass more than\n700GB of text in 2266 languages. We will refer\nto these sources of data asdata sources. Our data\ncovers many domains, including religious texts,\nnews articles and scientific papers. Some of the\ndata sources are high-quality, verified by native\nspeakers, translators and linguists. Others are less\nreliable such as web crawls and Wikipedia dumps.\nIt is therefore necessary to clean the data. For a list\nof data sources, see §C.\n3.2 Language-Scripts\nSomelanguagesarewritteninmultiplescripts;e.g.,\nTajik is written in both Cyrillic and Arabic scripts.\nSome data sources indicate the script, but others\neither do not or provide mixed text in multiple\nscripts. We detect the script for each sentence and\ntreat each language-script as a separate entity.\n3.3 Ngram LMs and Language Divergence\nWe train a 3-gram character-level language model\n𝑀𝑖 for each language-script 𝐿𝑖, using KenLM\n(Heafield, 2011). We refer to the perplexity calcu-\nlated for the corpus of language𝐿𝑖 using language\nmodel 𝑀𝑗 as PP(𝑀𝑗,𝐿𝑖). Similar to Gamallo\net al. (2017), we define a perplexity-based diver-\ngence measure of languages𝐿𝑖 and 𝐿𝑗 as:\nD𝐿𝑖 ,𝐿𝑗 = max (PP(𝑀𝑗,𝐿𝑖),PP(𝑀𝑖,𝐿 𝑗))\nWe useDto filter out noisy data in §3.4 and study\nthe effect of similar languages in LLM training in\n§6.7 and §6.8. For more details, see §A.\n3.4 Data Cleaning\nTo remove noise, we use chunk-level and corpus-\nlevel filters.\nWhile some sources are sentence-split, others\nprovide multiple sentences (e.g., a paragraph) as\none chunk. Chunk-level filters process each chunk\noftextfromadatasourceasaunit,withoutsentence-\nsplitting. Some chunk-level filters are based on the\nnotion of word: we use white space tokenization\nwhenpossibleandotherwiseresorttosentencePiece\n(KudoandRichardson,2018)trainedbyCosta-jussà\net al. (2022).\nAs chunk-level filters, we employ thesentence-\nlevel filtersSF1–SF5 from BigScience ROOTS\n(Laurençon et al., 2022).\nSF1Character repetition. If the ratio of repeated\ncharacters is too high, it is likely that the sentence\nhas not enough textual content.\nSF2 Word repetition. A high ratio of repeated\nwords indicates non-useful repetitive content.\nSF3 Special characters. Sentences with a high\nratio of special characters are likely to be crawling\nartifacts or computer code.\nSF4Insufficientnumberofwords. Sincetraining\nlanguage models requires enough context, very\nsmall chunks of text are not useful.\nSF5Deduplication. Iftwosentencesareidentical\nafter eliminating punctuation and white space, one\nis removed.\n1084\nlangsscriptssents’median s’\nGlot2000-c 2266 35 2.3B 8K\nGlot500-c 511 30 1.5B 120K\nCosta-jussà et al.

A sentence’ can consist of a short\nsegment, a complete sentence or a chunk (i.e.,\nseveral sentences).\nCorpus-level filtersdetect if the corpus of a\nlanguage-script is noisy; e.g., the corpus is in an-\nother language or consists of non-meaningful con-\ntent such as tabular data. We employ filters CF1\nand CF2.\nCF1 In case ofmismatch between language\nand script, the corpus is removed; e.g., Chinese\nwritten in Arabic is unlikely to be Chinese.\nCF2 Perplexity mismatch. For each language-\nscript L1, we find its closest language-script L2:\nthe language-script with the lowest perplexity di-\nvergence (§3.3). If L1 and L2 are not in the same\ntypological family, we check L1/L2 manually and\ntakeappropriateactionsuchasremovingthecorpus\n(e.g., if it is actually English) or correcting the ISO\ncode assigned to the corpus.\n3.5 Training Data: Glot500-c\nAmong the 2000+ language-scripts that we col-\nlected data for, after cleaning, most have too little\ndata for pretraining LLMs. It is difficult to quan-\ntify the minimum amount needed for pretraining.\nTherefore,wepickarelativelyhigh“safe”threshold,\n30,000sentences’, forinclusionoflanguage-scripts\ninmodeltraining. Thisallowsustotrainthemodel\neffectively and cover many low-resource languages.\nTable 1 givesGlot500-c statistics. See §B for a\nlist of language-scripts. We trainGlot500-m on\nGlot500-c; note that whileGlot500-c focuses on\ntail languages, it contains some data in head lan-\nguages which we include inGlot500-mtraining to\nprevent catastrophic forgetting.\nWe divide the corpus for each language into\ntrain/dev/test, reserving 1000 sentences’ each for\ndev and test and using the rest for train. We pick\n1000 parallel verses if we have a Bible translation\nXLM-R-B XLM-R-L Glot500-m\nModel Size 278M 560M 395M\nVocab Size 250K 250K 401K\nTransformer Size 86M 303M 86M\nTable 2: Model sizes.Glot500-m and XLM-R-B have\nthe same transformer size, butGlot500-m has a larger\nvocabulary, resulting in an overall larger model.\nand add 500 each to test and dev. These parallel\nverses convey identical meanings and facilitate\ncrosslingual evaluation. We pretrain the model\nusing only the training data.\n4 Glot500-m\n4.1 Vocabulary Extension\nTo extend XLM-R’s vocabulary, we use Sentence-\nPiece(KudoandRichardson,2018)withaunigram\nlanguage model (Kudo, 2018) to train a tokenizer\nwith a vocabulary size of 250K onGlot500-c. We\nsample data from different language-scripts accord-\ning to a multinomial distribution, with𝛼=.3. The\namount we sample for head languages is the same\nastaillanguageswiththelowestamount;thisfavors\ntail languages – head languages are already well\nlearned by XLM-R. We merge the obtained tokens\nwith XLM-R’s vocabulary. About 100K new to-\nkens were in fact old tokens, i.e., already part of\nXLM-R’s vocabulary. We take the probabilities\nof the (genuinely) new tokens directly from Sen-\ntencePiece. After adding the 151K new tokens to\nXLM-R’s vocabulary (which has size 250K), the\nvocabulary size of Glot500-m is 401K.\nWe could also calculate probabilities of existing\nand new tokens over a mixture of original XLM-R\ntraining corpus andGlot500-c(Chung et al., 2020).\nFor head languages, the percentage of changed\ntokens using the new tokenizer compared to the\noriginal tokenizer ranges from 0.2% to 50%. How-\never, we found no relationship between percentage\nof changed tokens and change in performance on\ndownstream tasks. Thus, there was little effect of\ntokenization in our experiments.\n4.2 Continued Pretraining\nWe createGlot500-m by continued pretraining of\nXLM-R-B with the MLM objective.

The resulting output is then divided into\nchunks of 512 tokens and fed to the model.\n5 Experimental Setup\nFor most tail languages, there are no manually\nlabeledevaluationdata. Wethereforeadoptamixed\nevaluation strategy: based partly on human labels,\npartly on evaluation methods that are applicable\nto many languages without requiring gold data.\nTable 3 lists all our evaluation tasks.\nPerplexity Following Salazar et al. (2020), we\ncalculate pseudoperplexity (PPPL) over the held-\nout test set. PPPL is based on masking tokens\none-by-one (not left to right). Salazar et al. (2020)\ngive evidence that PPPL is a better measure of\nlinguistic acceptability compared to standard left-\nto-right perplexity.\nRoundtrip Alignment For assessing the quality\nof multilingual representations for a broad range of\ntail languages without human gold data, we adopt\nroundtrip evaluation (Dufter et al., 2018). We first\nword-align sentences’ in a parallel corpus based on\nthemultilingualrepresentationsofanLLM.Wethen\nstartfromaword 𝑤inasentence’inlanguage-script\nL1, follow the alignment links to its translations in\nlanguage-script L2, then the alignment links from\nL2 to L3 and so on, until in the end we follow\nalignment links back to L1. If this “roundtrip” gets\nus back to𝑤, then it indicates that the LLM has\nsimilar representations for the meaning of𝑤 in\nlanguage-scripts L1, L2, L3, etc. In other words,\nthe cross-lingual quality of representations is high.\nVice versa, failure to get back to𝑤is a sign of poor\nmultilingual representations.\nWe use SimAlign (Jalili Sabet et al., 2020) and\nalignonthesub-wordlevelontheBiblepartoftest,\nbased on the representations of the LLM computed\nby transformer layer 8 as suggested in the original\npaper. We use intersection symmetrization: each\nword in a sentence’ is aligned to at most one word\nin the other sentence’.\nAs evaluation measure we compute the percent-\nage of roundtrips that were successes, i.e., the\nroundtrip starts at𝑤in L1 and returns back to𝑤.\nForeachlanguage-scriptintest,werandomlyselect\nthree language-scripts as intermediate points L2,\nL3, L4. Since the intermediate points influence\nthe results, we run the experiment five times with\ndifferentintermediatepointsandreporttheaverage.\nAll models are evaluated with the same five sets of\nthree intermediate language-scripts.\nSequence Labeling We consider two sequence\nlabeling tasks: Named Entity Recognition (NER)\nand Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging. We use the\nWikiANN dataset (Pan et al., 2017) for NER and\nversion v2.11 of Universal Dependencies (UD)\n(de Marneffe et al., 2021) for POS. Since training\ndata does not exist for some languages, we finetune\non English (with early stopping based on dev) and\nevaluatezero-shottransferonalllanguagescovered\nby WikiANN/UD. We set the learning rate to 2e-5\nwith Adam.\nSentence Retrieval Following (Hu et al., 2020),\nwe use up to 1000 English-aligned sentences’ from\nTatoeba (Artetxe and Schwenk, 2019) to evaluate\nSentRetr (sentence retrieval). We also use 500\nEnglish-aligned sentences’ from the Bible part of\ntest. We find nearest neighbors using cosine sim-\nilarity based on the average word embeddings in\nlayer𝑙 = 8 – following Jalili Sabet et al. (2020) –\nand compute top10 accuracy. For fair comparison\nand because the architectures are the same, we do\nnot optimize the hyperparameter𝑙forGlot500-m\nand XLM-R-B.\nText Classification We evaluate on Taxi1500\n(Ma et al., 2023). It provides gold data for text\nclassification with six classes in a large number\nof language-scripts of whichGlot500-m supports\n354. We finetune on English (with early stopping\non dev) and evaluate zero-shot on test of the target\nlanguage-script. Learning rate: 2e-5, batch size:\n1086\n16 (following Ma et al. (2023)).\n6 Experiments\nIn this section, we discuss aggregate results. For\ndetailed results, see §D and §E.\n6.1 Results\nTable 4 gives results. Glot500-m outperforms\nXLM-R-B on all tasks for both head and tail\nlanguage-scripts, except for POS on head. That\nGlot500-moutperforms XLM-R-B is expected for\ntail language-scripts (i.e., those not covered by\nXLM-R). For these language-scripts the improve-\nment margin is large. Outperformance may seem\ncounterintuitive for head language-scripts (those\ncoveredbyXLM-R)since Glot500-mhasthesame\nnumber of (non-embedding) parameters as XLM-\nR-B. Since the number of covered languages has\ngreatly increased, leaving less capacity per lan-\nguage, we might expect underperformance. There\nare a few possible explanations. First, XLM-R may\nbe undertrained, and the inclusion of more head\nlanguage training data may improve their repre-\nsentations. Second, having more languages may\nimprove multilinguality by allowing languages to\nsynergize and enhance each other’s representations\nand cross-lingual transfer. Third, there are lan-\nguages similar to head languages among the tail\nlanguages, which in turn aids head languages.\nThe gap betweenGlot500-m and the baselines\nfor tail language-scripts in sequence labeling is\nsmaller. These tasks do not require as deep an\nunderstanding of language and thus transfer from\nheadtotaillanguage-scriptsiseasierthroughshared\ntokens.\nGlot500-m also outperforms XLM-R-L for tail\nlanguage-scripts (all tasks) and head language-\nscripts (3 tasks). This suggests that scaling up\nsize is not the only way for improvements. We can\nalsoimprovethequalityofmultilingualLLMrepre-\nsentations by increasing the number of languages.\n6.2 Language Coverage\nTable 5 comparesGlot500-m vs. XLM-R-B on\npseudoperplexity. For fair comparison we use\nword-level normalization. For 69 head language-\nscripts, Glot500-munderperformsXLM-R-B.This\nis expected asGlot500-m’s training data is small\nfortheselanguage-scripts. Glot500-moutperforms\nXLM-R-B for 420 tail language-scripts.\nThere are eight tail language-scripts for which\n0.400\n0.500\n0.600\n0.700\n0.800\n0 20 40 60\nhead tail\nSentence Retrieval Tatoeba\n0.100\n0.200\n0.300\n0.400\n0.500\n0.600\n0 20 40 60\nhead tail\nSentence Retrieval Bible\nepochs\n0.500\n0.600\n0.700\n0.800\n0 20 40 60\nhead tail\nPOS\nepochs\n0.500\n0.550\n0.600\n0.650\n0 20 40 60\nhead tail\nNER\nFigure 1: Progression of training for sentence retrieval\nand sequence labeling. x-axis: epochs/10K. The im-\nprovement is fast in the beginning for tail languages,\nthen gets slower and and reaches a plateau. This pattern\nis partially observed for head languages.\nGlot500-m performs worse than XLM-R-B. Five\nare tail languages with a similar head lan-\nguage where the two share a macro-language:\nekk/Standard Estonian (est/Estonian), aln/Gheg\nAlbanian (sqi/Albanian), nob/Norwegian Bokmal\n(nor/Norwegian),hbs/Serbo-Croatian(srp/Serbian),\nlvs/Standard Latvian (lav/Latvian). Since XLM-\nR-B’s pretraining corpus is large for the five head\nlanguages,itsperformanceisgoodfortheclosetail\nlanguages.\nThe other three languages all have a unique\nscript: sat/Santali (Ol Chiki script), div/Dhivehi\n(Thaana script), iku/Inuktitut (Inuktitut syllabics).\nFor these languages, XLM-R-B’s tokenizer returns\nmany UNK tokens since it is not trained on these\nscripts, resulting in an unreasonably optimistic esti-\nmate of pseudoperplexity by our implementation.\nGlot500-m’s token-level normalized pseudoper-\nplexity ranges from 1.95 for lhu/Lahu to 94.4 for\ntok/Toki Pona. The average is 13.5, the median\n10.6. We analyze the five language-scripts with\nthe highest pseudoperplexity: tok_Latn, luo_Latn,\nacm_Arab, ach_Latn, and teo_Latn.\ntok/TokiPonaisaconstructedlanguage.

Glot500-mper-\nforms better on almost all tail language-scripts. §6.2\ndiscusses the eight exceptions.\nity could be related to the fact that they are tonal\nlanguages, but the tones are not orthographically\nindicated. Another possible explanation is that\nthe training data is dominated by one subcorpus\n(Jehova’s Witnesses) whereas the test data are dom-\ninated by PBC. There are orthographic differences\nbetweenthetwo,e.g.,“dong”(JW)vs.“doŋ”(PBC)\nfor Acoli. These three languages are also spoken\noveralargeareaincountrieswithdifferentstandard\nlanguages, which could increase variability.\nOur analysis is not conclusive. We note however\nthat the gap between the three languages and the\nnext most difficult languages in terms of pseudop-\nerplexity is not large. So maybe Luo, Acoli and\nTeso are simply (for reasons still to be determined)\nlanguages that have higher perplexity than others.\n6.3 Training Progression\nTo analyze the training process, we evaluate\nGlot500-m on sequence labeling and SentRetr at\n10,000-step intervals. Figure 1 shows that perfor-\nmanceimprovesrapidlyattheonsetoftraining,but\nthen the rate of improvement slows down. This\ntrendisparticularlypronouncedfortaillanguagesin\nSentRetr. In comparison, sequence labeling is rela-\ntivelystraightforward,withthebaseline(XLM-R-B,\nepoch 0) achieving high performance by correctly\ntransferringprevalentclassessuchas verbandnoun\nthrough shared vocabulary, resulting in a smaller\nimprovement of Glot500-m vs. XLM-R-B.\nFor SentRetr, we observe larger improvements\nfor the Bible than for Tatoeba. This is likely due to\nthehigherproportionofreligiousdatain Glot500-c,\ncompared to XLM-R’s training data (i.e., CC100).\nThe average performance on downstream tasks\npeaks at 480K steps. We have taken a snapshot of\nGlot500-m at this stage and released it.\n6.4 Analysis across Language-Scripts\nTo analyze the effect of language-scripts, we select\nfive tail language-scripts each with the largest and\nsmallestgainwhencomparing Glot500-mvs.XLM-\nR-B for SentRetr and sequence labeling.\nTable 6 shows thatGlot500-m improves lan-\nguages with scripts not covered by XLM-R (e.g.,\ndiv/Dhivehi, Thaana script, see §6.2) by a large\nmarginsinceXLM-Rsimplyregardstheuncovered\nscripts as unknown tokens and cannot compute\nmeaningful representations for the input. The large\namount of data we collected inGlot500-c also\ncontributes to the improvement for tail languages,\ne.g., for tat_Cyrl (Tatar) in SentRetr Tatoeba and\nmlt_Latn (Maltese) in POS. See §6.7 for a detailed\nanalysis of the effect of corpus size.\nOntheotherhand, Glot500-machievesjustcom-\nparable or even worse results for some language-\nscripts. We see at least three explanations. (i)\nAs discussed in §6.2, some tail languages (e.g.,\nnob/Norwegian Bokmal) are close to a head lan-\nguage (e.g., nor/Norwegian), soGlot500-mhas no\nadvantage over XLM-R-B. (ii) A language is at the\nlow end of our corpus size range (i.e., 30,000 sen-\ntences’). Example: xav_Latn, Xavánte. (iii) Some\nlanguages are completely distinct from all other\nlanguages inGlot500-c, thus without support from\nany similar language. An example is mau_Latn,\nHuautla Mazatec.

We\nfocus on SentRetr Bible (§5) since it supports the\nmostheadandtaillanguages. WefindthatPearson’s\n𝑟 = .34, i.e., corpus size and performance are\nmoderately, but clearly correlated. We suspect that\nthe correlation is not larger because, in addition\nto corpus size of language𝑙 itself, corpus size of\nlanguages closely related to𝑙is also an important\nfactor(see§6.4forasimilarfindingforNorwegian).\nWe therefore also compute Pearson’s𝑟between (i)\nperformance of language𝑙on SentRetr Bible and\n(ii)jointcorpussizeof 𝑙andits 𝑘nearestneighbors\n(according to perplexity divergence, §3.3). In this\ncase, Pearson’s𝑟 = .44 (for both𝑘 = 3 and 𝑘 = 4),\nindicating that the corpus size of nearest neighbor\nlanguages does play a role.\n6.8 Support through Related Languages\nBuildingon§6.7,thereisanotherwaywecaninves-\ntigatethepositiveeffectofcloselyrelatedlanguages\non performance: We can compare performance\n(again on SentRetr Bible) of continued pretraining\non just one language (we refer to this model as\nGlot+1) vs. on all 511 languages represented in\nGlot500-c (i.e., Glot500-m). Table 9 presents re-\nsults for six language-scripts selected from various\nlanguagefamiliesandsuggeststhatsomelanguages\ndo not receive support from related languages (top\nthree).

We observe large\nimprovementsforbothheadandtaillanguagescom-\nparedtoXLM-R.Ouranalysisshowsthatnosingle\nfactor fully explains the quality of the representa-\ntion of a language in a multilingual model. Rather,\na combination of factors is important, including\ncorpus size, script, “help” from related languages\nand the total capacity of the model.\nThis work is the first to create a language model\non a dataset of several hundreds of gigabytes and\nto make it publicly available for such a large and di-\nverse number of low-resource languages. In future\nresearch, we would like to train larger models to\nfurther investigate the effect of model size, distill\nhighly multilingual models for resource-efficient\ndeployment, explore alternatives to continued pre-\ntraining and use models for more tail language\ndownstream tasks.\nLimitations\n(1) We did not perform any comprehensive hy-\nperparameter search, which would have further\nconsolidated our results.

(3) Although we have tried\nto minimize the amount of noise in our data, some\nnoise is still present.\nEthics Statement\nThere are two issues worth mentioning in regards\nto this project. First, it was not feasible for us\nto thoroughly examine the content of the data for\nall languages, thus we cannot confirm the absence\nof discrimination based on factors such as race or\nsexuality. The data was solely utilized as a textual\ncorpus, and the content should not be interpreted\nasanendorsementbyourteam. Ifthemodelissub-\nsequently utilized for generation, it is possible that\nthe training data may be reflected in the generated\noutput.

Assuming a test data contains sequences of\n1097\ncharacters 𝑆= 𝑐ℎ1,𝑐ℎ2,··· ,𝑐ℎ𝑇, perplexity (PP)\nof𝑆givenann-gramcharacterlevellanguagemodel\n𝑀is computed as follows:\nPP(𝑆,𝑀 )=\n𝑇\n√ 𝑇/√︁√︂oductdi√︄√︁lay.\n𝑡=1\n1\nP (𝑐ℎ𝑡 |𝑐ℎ𝑡−1\n1\n) (1)\nwhere P (𝑐ℎ𝑡 |𝑐ℎ𝑡−1\n1\n)is computed as by dividing\nthe observed frequency (𝐶) of 𝑐ℎ𝑡−1\n1 𝑐ℎ𝑖 by the\nobserved frequency of𝑐ℎ𝑡−1\n1 in 𝑀training data:\nP\n(\n𝑐ℎ𝑡 |𝑐ℎ𝑡−1\n1\n)\n=\n𝐶(𝑐ℎ𝑡−1\n1 𝑐ℎ𝑡\n)\n𝐶(𝑐ℎ𝑡−1\n1\n) (2)\nGiventhedefinitionofperplexity,wecandetermine\nhow well a trained language model on language𝐿1\npredicts the test text of language𝐿2 and vice-versa.\nThedivergencebetweentwolanguagesiscomputed\nwith the maximum of the perplexity values in both\ndirections. Two reasons lead to the use ofmax:\nfirst, a symmetrical divergence is required, and\nsecond, languages differ in their complexity, so\none direction of computing perplexity may result\nin a much lower perplexity than another. Thus,\ncomparing perplexity results becomes difficult. As\nan example, the Kuanua language (ksd_Latn) has\nshort words and a simple structure, which results\nin 3−gram models getting lower perplexity on its\ntext compared to other languages. The lower the\nperplexity the smaller the divergence between lan-\nguages. The divergence (D) between language𝐿𝑖\nand 𝐿𝑗 with trained language models of𝑀𝐿𝑧 and\ntest texts of𝑆𝐿𝑧 , where𝐿𝑧 is the corresponding\nlanguage, computed as follows:\nD𝐿𝑖,𝐿𝑗 = max(PP(𝑆𝐿𝑖 ,𝑀𝐿𝑗 ),PP(𝑆𝐿𝑗 ,𝑀𝐿𝑖 )) (3)\nRuns and Data.The data used to train and test\nthe character level n-gram models is the same data\nused for the training and testing of theGlot500-m.\nThe training of the models was limited to100,000\nsentences’ per language-script. We use KenLM\nlibrary (Heafield, 2011) to build n-gram models.\nThis library uses an interpolated modified Kneser-\nNey smoothing for estimating the unseen n-grams.\nOur evaluation has been performed over 7 n-gram\nmodels (3 ≤𝑛≤9).\nBaseline and Evaluation.Language family trees\nwere used as a baseline for evaluating the diver-\ngence measures of the proposed approach. We\nobtained language family tree data from Ethno-\nlogue online version (Eberhard et al., 2022). For\neachlanguage,thefamilytreefollowsthegeneralor-\nder from largest typological language family group\nto smallest. There is only one family tree for each\nlanguage in the baseline data. Nodes in the family\ntree represent typological language family groups.\nEach node only has one parent, so if a node is\ncommon in the family tree of two languages, its\nparent is also common. We evaluate our perplex-\nity method on the following binary classification\ntask: Do the majority of a language𝐿𝑧’s𝑘nearest\nneighbors belong to the same typological language\nfamily group as𝐿𝑧? Assuming languages𝐿𝑖 and\n𝐿𝑗, with the following family trees:\n𝑇𝐿𝑖 : 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6\n𝑇𝐿𝑗 : 1 → 2 → 7 → 8\nThese 2 languages belong to the same typological\nfamily group with family tree levels of𝑙 ∈{1,2},\nbut not with family tree levels of𝑙 = 3 and higher.\nResult. When it comes to language families, the\nmajority of studies only refer to the largest typo-\nlogical language family group (level𝑙 = 1). Here,\nwe also assess our methodology for other levels.\nThe results of classification accuracy for3−gram\nmodel, 𝑘 ∈{1,3,7,13,21}and 𝑙 ∈{1,2,3,max}\nareshowninTable10. Incaseswherethemaximum\nlevel of a tree is less than the𝑙parameter, the max-\nimum level for that language is used. Languages\nwithout a family or no other family member in our\ndata are excluded. We only report the3−gram\nmodel results as it gets the best results in most\nconfigurations among other n-gram models. With\nincreasing 𝑙, the accuracy decreases, since more\nlanguages fall outside the same typological family.\nAs𝑘increases,theaccuracydecreases,becauselan-\nguages with faraway neighbors are being included\nbut the number of languages in the language typo-\nlogical group family will remain the same. There\nare times when languages have a lot of loan words\nfromotherlanguagesbecauseofgeologicalproxim-\nity or historical reasons (e.g, colonization), which\nmakesthemsimilartothelanguagestheyborrowed\nwordsfrominourmethod. Howevertheyarediffer-\nent when it comes to their typological families and\nourmethodfailsinthesecases. Aymara(Macrolan-\nguage: aym_Latn) and Quechua (Macrolanguage:\nque_Latn), for example, had a great deal of contact\nand influence on each other, but they do not belong\nto the same typological group. As well, some of\nthe typological families are not that large, which\nmakes our results worse when𝑘increases.

This issue becomes more prevalent in ex-\ntensive collections. Within the ISO 639-3 standard,\nthese languages are referred to as macrolanguages.\nWhen confronted with macrolanguages, if it is not\nfeasibletoascertainthespecificindividuallanguage\ncontainedwithinadataset,themacrolanguagecode\nis retained.

Did you describe the limitations of your work?\nsection ’Limitation’\n□\u0013 A2. Did you discuss any potential risks of your work?\nsection ‘Ethics Statement’\n□\u0013 A3. Do the abstract and introduction summarize the paper’s main claims?\nAbstract and section 1\n□\u0017 A4. Have you used AI writing assistants when working on this paper?\nLeft blank.\nB □\u0013 Did you use or create scientiﬁc artifacts?\nsection 3.3, section 4, appendix c\n□\u0013 B1. Did you cite the creators of artifacts you used?\nsection 3.3, section 4, appendix c\n□\u0013 B2. Did you discuss the license or terms for use and / or distribution of any artifacts?\nsection ‘Ethics Statement’\n□\u0013 B3. Did you discuss if your use of existing artifact(s) was consistent with their intended use, provided\nthat it was speciﬁed? For the artifacts you create, do you specify intended use and whether that is\ncompatible with the original access conditions (in particular, derivatives of data accessed for research\npurposes should not be used outside of research contexts)?\nsection ‘Ethics Statement’\n□\u0017 B4. Did you discuss the steps taken to check whether the data that was collected / used contains any\ninformation that names or uniquely identiﬁes individual people or offensive content, and the steps\ntaken to protect / anonymize it?\nSince our work deals with millions of sentences in hundreds of languages, it was impossible for us to\ncheck the content. We leave it as a future work\n□\u0013 B5. Did you provide documentation of the artifacts, e.g., coverage of domains, languages, and\nlinguistic phenomena, demographic groups represented, etc.?\nsection 3.1, appendix a, appendix c\n□\u0013 B6. Did you report relevant statistics like the number of examples, details of train / test / dev splits,\netc. for the data that you used / created? Even for commonly-used benchmark datasets, include the\nnumber of examples in train / validation / test splits, as these provide necessary context for a reader\nto understand experimental results. For example, small differences in accuracy on large test sets may\nbe signiﬁcant, while on small test sets they may not be.\nsection 5\nC □\u0013 Did you run computational experiments?\nsection 4.2\n□\u0013 C1. Did you report the number of parameters in the models used, the total computational budget\n(e.g., GPU hours), and computing infrastructure used?\nsection 4.2\nThe Responsible NLP Checklist used at ACL 2023 is adopted from NAACL 2022, with the addition of a question on AI writing\nassistance.\n1116\n□\u0013 C2. Did you discuss the experimental setup, including hyperparameter search and best-found\nhyperparameter values?\nsection 5\n□\u0013 C3. Did you report descriptive statistics about your results (e.g., error bars around results, summary\nstatistics from sets of experiments), and is it transparent whether you are reporting the max, mean,\netc. or just a single run?\nsection 5. For continued pretraining, it is a single run due to computational resource limitation. For\ndownstream task evaluation, it is multilple runs across 5 seeds.\n□\u0013 C4.
