    "abstract": "This article is focused on the theory of unacceptable effect on transformer winding, mainly the overvoltages and the mechanical forces. In the next part of the article is described the measurement of selfdischarging voltage frequency dependence on transformer. The second measurement shows one of the possible type of SFRA method. The measurement results lead us only to the conclusion that some changes of the winding condition have occurred.",
