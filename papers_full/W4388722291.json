    "abstract": "Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence systems trained by deep learning algorithms to process natural language and generate text responses to user prompts. Some approach physician performance on a range of medical challenges, leading some proponents to advocate for their potential use in clinical consultation and prompting some consternation about the future of cognitive specialties. However, LLMs currently have limitations that preclude safe clinical deployment in performing specialist consultations, including frequent confabulations, lack of contextual awareness crucial for nuanced diagnostic and treatment plans, inscrutable and unexplainable training data and methods, and propensity to recapitulate biases. Nonetheless, considering the rapid improvement in this technology, growing calls for clinical integration, and healthcare systems that chronically undervalue cognitive specialties, it is critical that infectious diseases clinicians engage with LLMs to enable informed advocacy for how they should—and shouldn’t—be used to augment specialist care.",
