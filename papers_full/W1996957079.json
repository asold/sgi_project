The expansion of cognitive niches and tool-use capabilities probably stimulated each other in hominid evolution. To\nunderstand the causes of cognitive expansion in humans, we need to know the behavioral and neural basis of tool use.\nAlthough a wide range of animals exhibit tool use in nature, most studies have focused on primates and birds on behavioral\nor psychological levels and did not directly address questions of which neural modifications contributed to the emergence\nof tool use. To investigate such questions, an animal model suitable for cellular and molecular manipulations is needed.\nMethodology/Principal Findings: We demonstrated for the first time that rodents can be trained to use tools. Through a\nstep-by-step training procedure, we trained degus (Octodon degus) to use a rake-like tool with their forelimbs to retrieve\notherwise out-of-reach rewards. Eventually, they mastered effective use of the tool, moving it in an elegant trajectory. After\nthe degus were well trained, probe tests that examined whether they showed functional understanding of the tool were\nperformed. Degus did not hesitate to use tools of different size, colors, and shapes, but were reluctant to use the tool with a\nraised nonfunctional blade. Thus, degus understood the functional and physical properties of the tool after extensive\ntraining.\nConclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that tool use is not a specific faculty resulting from higher intelligence, but\nis a specific combination of more general cognitive faculties.

Simple forms of\ntool use are observed in a wide range of animals [3], but to examine\nthe functional and causal understanding of tools, tool-use behavior\nhas been extensively studied only in nonhuman primates [4–7] and\nbirds [8,9]. While these studies are important for examining\nbehavioral and evolutionary hypotheses regarding the origin of\nhuman tool use, tool-use behavior should result in modifications of\nbrain architecture and such modifications should again affect the\nway tool-use behavior is organized. Thus, not only behavioral, but\nalso the neural and molecular bases of tool-use behavior, should be\ninvestigated to clarify the causes of cognitive expansion in humans.\nWe need a practical animal model with which to efficiently explore\nthe neural and molecular bases of tool use.\nIn contrast to naturalistic tool use in the wild, tool-use training\nin captive environments not only provides insights into the\ncognitive potential of animals [10,11] but may also provide a\nneurobiological platform for fruitful extrapolations about the\nhigher mental faculties of humans [12,13]. Although such a non-\nnaturalistic approach may have a drawback in that ecological and\nevolutionary relevance could be tenuous, it may alternatively\nprovide powerful probes into the neurobiology of advanced\ncognitive functions under precise experimental control. This\napproach has been successful in a series of studies in macaques:\ntool-use training resulted in spontaneous refinement of motor\ntrajectory [10] and the spontaneous and rapid application of meta-\ntools [14]. Moreover, it was accompanied by gene expression and\ncircuit reorganization in the intraparietal cortex, which led to the\nemergence of novel functional connections with the temporopa-\nrietal and prefrontal areas [15].\nAs such, macaque monkeys have been the only animal models\nfor neurobiological investigations based on the assumption that\ntheir phylogenic proximity to humans might aid successful\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 3 | e1860\nextrapolation of findings [16,17]. However, here we provide a\nrodent model for tool use, which should dramatically widen the\nrange of experimental manipulation. Although some research has\nexamined natural tool use in rodents [18,19], this is the first study\nof controlled tool-use training. The species we used for this study is\nthe degu. We decided to test degus’ capacity for tool use because of\nthe following ensemble of evidence, all of which implied the superb\nmanual dexterity and good eye–hand coordination essential for\ntool use. Degus are highly social, diurnal rodents [20] that use\nvisual, auditory, and olfactory cues in their social communication\n[21]. The openings of degu burrows are mounds adorned with\npiles of sticks, stones, and cow dung [22]. Captive degus engage in\nthe spontaneous construction of nesting cups, which has been\nrarely observed in primates [23]. Moreover, degus engage in\nseveral types of nonfunctional ‘‘play’’-type behavior among nest\nmates [24] and have well developed prefrontal areas sensitive to\nearly social deprivation [25]. This evidence implies a high level of\ncuriosity in this species, which makes it suitable for cooperative\nexperimenter–subject relations, as well as the behavioral flexibility\nrequired for tool-use training.\nResults\nWe trained five adult degus to use a rake-like tool to retrieve a\ndistant food reward. The tool was a T-shaped rake that consisted\nof a wire shaft and a rectangular plate attached perpendicularly at\nthe end. Training was conducted in a chamber that had a fence\nseparating the animal and the food reinforcement. A step-by-step\ntraining program similar to that used for macaques [10,11] was\nestablished and degus were trained accordingly (supplementary\nvideo 1, Movie S1). A trial began when a food item was placed\noutside the fence and out of the animal’s reach, followed by the\ntool being placed outside the fence with its grip facing the animal.\nThe degu was then allowed to manipulate the tool to retrieve the\nfood (Fig. 1A). Training was conducted at two different levels\n(Levels 1 and 2), each of which consisted of two different sublevels\n(‘‘a’’ and ‘‘b’’) of difficulty according to the relative position of the\ntool and the reinforcement (Fig. 1B). The distance between the\ntool and the reward was initially very close (Level 1a) and then was\nextended gradually (Level 1b; Movie S2). After the animal learned\nthis task, the reward began to be placed at the side of the tool so\nthat the animal had to move the tool laterally before pulling it in\n(Level 2a; Movie S3). Finally, the food was placed beyond the tool\nso that the animal had to first push the tool beyond the food, move\nit laterally, and then pull on it to get the food (Level 2b; Movie S4).\nFigure 2 illustrates the averaged and individual time course of\nfive degus that learned to use the tool with their forelimbs\n(criterion for acquisition: $75% for three successive sessions).\nLevel 1a training was easy for them and all five animals completed\nit within one session (filled symbol, first session). In contrast, the\nnumber of sessions required to successfully reach Level 1b (filled\nsymbols, 2\nnd session and after) varied from 6 to 11 depending on\nthe individual. In the initial phase of Level 2a (open symbols), most\nanimals did not retry after the first (failed) attempt to pull in the\nfood, whereupon the difficulty level was converted to Level 2b.\nThe success rate then dropped to about 40% (Fig. 2; around the\n15th sessions). As the training continued in Level 2a, the animals\nbegan to hold the tool for a longer time after an initial failure. This\nlonger, more secure tool holding was followed by the emergence of\nnew characteristic behavioral patterns shown in Figure 3. The\ndegus began to move the rake back and forth and around the\nreward, pushing the tool or wiggling it horizontally (Fig. 3A,\nMovie S5). With this shift in behavior, success rates again began\nto increase (Fig. 2; around the 30\nth sessions). At this early phase\n(20th–35th sessions), the animals began to stare at the food rather\nthan the tip of the tool as they had at the very beginning of the\ntraining.\nDuring the middle phase (35\nth–50th sessions) of Level 2a\ntraining, all subjects learned to control the rake with two distinct\nmotions: first, moving the tool horizontally toward the food, and\nsecond, pulling it vertically toward themselves (red line and broken\ngreen line in Fig. 3B-ab, Movie S6 and Movie S7). These two\nmotions could be clearly identified as two peaks in their velocity\nprofiles, as depicted in Figure 3Bb. The time separation between\nthese two peaks shortened as their skill improved, suggesting\nincreasing efficiency of usage. All five animals successfully\nFigure 1. Performance example of tool use and levels of\ntraining. A. An example of the performance by one degu at Level 2a.\nRight column: Video frames depicting representative epochs during a\nsingle attempt at food retrieval using a rake tool. In the beginning, the\ndegu failed to draw in the sunflower seed (1,100 ms). The animal then\nadjusted the position of the tool carefully after it observed the position\nof the food (2,000 ms) and pulled in the reward successfully (3,200 ms).\nLeft column: Trajectories of the tip of the tool between the previous\nand following frames (red lines) are superimposed on the trajectory\nduring the entire course of retrieval (gray lines, identical for all frames).\nOrientation and position of the rake (green squares and bars) and the\nlocation of food (orange dots) are also shown (traced from the\nphotographs in the right column). B. Levels of training. At Level 1a, the\nanimal can simply pull the tool toward itself. At Level 1b, the distance to\npull is increased. At Level 2a, the animal has to make a lateral\nmovement (s) before pulling the tool toward itself (t). At Level 2b, the\nanimal has to place the tool beyond the reward before pulling.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001860.g001\nTool Use Training in a Rodent\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 3 | e1860\nadvanced to Level 2b training after an average of 57 sessions\n(range 36–67 sessions). In the late phase (about the.50th session)\nof the training, in three of the five animals, a very smooth\ntrajectory consisting of continuous motions exhibiting a single\nvelocity peak (dotted blue line, Fig. 3Bb, Movie S8) occasionally\nappeared.\nFour of the five animals were further tested for their conceptual\nunderstanding of the tool in a series of probe tests (Fig. 4, Table 1)\n[5,6]. Under the first condition (A), the familiar sequence of\nstimulus presentation was reversed—tool first, food second—to see\nif it would disrupt the animals’ acquired skill. Second (B), two new\ntools that differed in color, shape, or size were presented to test\nwhether the degus could generalize their acquired tool-use facility.\nThird (C, D), two tools—the functional one that had been used for\nthe training and a nonfunctional one that had the plate of the tool\nraised by wire so that food could not be retrieved—were given to\nthe degus in a simultaneous choice test to see which tool they\nselected first. Finally (E), aversiveness to novelty (i.e., a xenophobic\ntendency of the animals) was tested in a same choice test by\npresenting two tools, one that had been used in training and\nanother functional but novel tool. The final condition was added\nto determine whether the unfamiliarity with the second tool acted\nas an aversive stimulus.\nUnder the first condition (A), when the order of presentation\nwas reversed so that the tool was already available before a new\nreward was placed, all four subjects manipulated the tool just as in\nFigure 2. The average and individual learning curves.Left top: The average success rate (in percent;y-axis) plotted by session (x-axis) for Level\n1a (first session only) and Level 1b (2nd–18th sessions) (filled symbols) and Level 2a (open symbols). Sessions were numbered independently for Levels\n1 and 2 and aligned at the origin of the abscissa because sessions for later Level 1 and early Level 2—easy and difficult sessions, respectively—were\nintermingled to keep the animals motivated. Note that in practice, Level 2a training contained trials that resulted in Level 2b difficulty after the first\nretrieval attempt failed, leaving the food behind the tool. Each data point represents the average of the five animals. The rest of the graphs: Learning\ncurves of individual animals (#1–#5). The success rate (in percent;y-axis) is plotted by session (x-axis) for Level 1a (first session), Level 1b (2nd–20th\nsessions) (filled symbols), and Level 2a (open symbols) for each of the five animals. Level 1a training was given only for one session. For Levels 1b and\n2a, the criterion for success was 75% or higher in three consecutive sessions. After the criterion was satisfied, some animals received additional\ntraining. Sessions are numbered independently for Levels 1 and 2, and are aligned at the origin of the abscissa.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001860.g002\nTool Use Training in a Rodent\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 3 | e1860\ntraining and their behavior was not disrupted by the reversed\ncontingency (success rate 60–90%) (Movie S9). The degus were\nnot randomly manipulating the tool before the new reward was\nplaced, and they began to manipulate the tool purposefully when a\nnew reward was placed on the platform. Under the second\ncondition (B), the degus showed quick generalization to the new\ntools (success rate 100% for all animals, Movie S10). Under the\nthird condition (C and D), they selected the functional tool over\nthe nonfunctional one (success rate 60–80%, Movie S11 and\nMovie S12). Under the final condition (E), the degus showed no\nsign of aversion to the unfamiliar tool (average 47.5%, Movie S13)\nwhen two equally functional tools were presented. Binomial tests\ncomparing performances in each of the probe tests C, D, and E\nrevealed that the four animals as a group selected the functional\ntool over the nonfunctional one significantly more often (C:\np = 0.006; D: p = 0.038) but they chose between two functional\nFigure 3.

B: Representative\nexamples of trajectories (a) and corresponding velocity profiles (b) of the tool head chosen from an early-middle phase of training (middle 1; red line),\na late-middle phase (middle 2; broken green line), and a late phase (dotted blue line) during Level 2a training in one degu. In B-a, time zero indicates\nthe time when the degu changed the angle of the rake upon approaching the reward. In the early-middle phase, the velocity of the tool was\ngenerally slow and became particularly slow at around time zero, presumably because the degu took time to adjust the angle of the tool relative to\nthe food. In the late-middle phase, the velocity peaked at20.4 s and 0.6 s and decreased after the degu changed the angle of the tool at time zero.\nIn the late phase, the velocity peak of the tool came at around time zero. Movie clips from which the above data were obtained are shown in Movie\nS5-8.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001860.g003\nTool Use Training in a Rodent\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 March 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 3 | e1860\ntools at random ( E: p = 0.875). In sum, the results of the probe\ntests suggest that the animals understood the tools’ functional\nproperties (i.e., whether the tool could be used to retrieve food)\nand ignored their irrelevant properties (i.e., color and familiarity,\nand within certain ranges, shape and size) (Table 1).\nDiscussion\nOur results show that a species of rodent, the degu, can be\ntrained to manipulate a rake-like tool using the forelimbs to\nretrieve a distant food reward. After extensive training for the task,\ndegus showed functional understanding of the tool. Together with\nreports on tool use and its functional understanding in birds\n[9,26,27], our results justify a change in the conventional view of\nanimal intelligence based on phylogenic relations with humans\n[28]. Our findings suggest a refined view in which the prerequisites\nfor higher cognitive functions, including tool use and its functional\nunderstanding, may occur in a wide range of animals; moreover,\nsocio-ecological factors may be more important than phylogenic\nfactors for such functions to evolve [9].\nAfter learning the basic skill of simply pulling the tool, the degus\nspontaneously devised more flexible, efficient and versatile use of\nthe tool. The number of trials (about 2,500 trials, 35–45 trials per\nday, average 57 days) required to train degus for tool use was\ncomparable to that required for Japanese macaques (about 2,600\ntrials, 160–250 trials per day, 13–14 days) in a similar task [10],\nand to similar criteria for trials to be regarded successful.\nMoreover, highly trained degus showed similar trajectories of tool\nmanipulation as those seen in Japanese macaques [10]. In the\nmiddle phase, lateral movement and pulling consisted of two\ndistinct trajectories with two peak velocities, which as efficiency\nincreased, gradually merged into one smooth, continuous\ntrajectory that minimized the time and energy required to obtain\nthe reward (Fig. 3B). The degus were taking advantage of some of\nthe tool’s physical properties such as mass, inertia, and friction.\nThese observations suggest that tool use by degus and Japanese\nmacaques share some of behaviorally common characteristics that\nmay represent a standardized set of cognitive skills necessary for\ngeneral implementation of tool use.\nAfter extensive training on tool use, probe tests demonstrated\nthat degus gained functional understanding of the tool. The degus\nignored irrelevant tool properties such as shape, size, and color\nwhile paying attention to its functional attributes in attaining food\nreinforcement. The results of our probe tests are comparable to\nthose of the vervet monkey [6]. These results can be interpreted to\nmean that degus attempt mental manipulation of the tool before\nactually selecting an alternative. These results suggest that through\ntraining, degus developed a mental representation of the tool that\nfocused heavily on the functional aspect.\nTool use in macaques led to the expression of immediate early\ngenes and neurotrophic factors in the intraparietal cortex [28] and\nresulted in intraparietal bimodal neurons (which integrate\nsomatosensory and visual information relating to the hand/\nforearm) extending their visual receptive fields to include tools as\nextensions of innate body parts. In the rodent brain, sensory\nplasticity as demonstrated by gene expression has been detected in\nthe barrel cortex [29] and auditory cortex [30], and motor\nFigure 4.

Observing the degree of plasticity in the rodent brain,\nwe can reasonably assume that the present tool-use training in\ndegus could also results in extended representations in parieto-\ntemporal areas and newly formed connections between brain\nareas, including the prefrontal cortex, similar to that observed in\nthe macaque brain. This would comprise an immediate extension\nof the present study, among other potential neurobiological\nexaminations.\nHere we showed that given precise experimental controls,\nrodents can be trained to perform a complex task. Having\nestablished a rodent model for tool use, we can now ask further\nquestions regarding the neurobiology of tool use. Our demonstra-\ntion of successful training of tool use in rodents should encourage\nsuch studies in other species that are amenable to similar\nenvironmental, behavioral, genetic, and physiological manipula-\ntions. Which types of neural plasticity, perhaps including adult\nneurogenesis [32], are involved in the emergence of acquired\npurposive behavior? How does hand–eye dexterity develop\nthrough training? Does the rodent brain have a mirror neuron\nsystem, and if so, how might this enhance their general cognition?\nThese are all questions raised by the current rodent model. By\nshaping a challenging behavior that involves combinations of\nseveral brain areas not normally connected by ecological\npressures, we can modify existing brain circuitry in the animals\n[15]. Such ‘‘constructive’’ neuroscience based on the enhancement\nof animals could be a new paradigm for tackling many otherwise\nintractable puzzles of human intelligence.\nMaterials and Methods\nAnimals and their maintenance\nFour male (10-month-old) and one female (5-month-old) degus\n(weight 180–240 g) from three litters were tested. Initially, we\nselected two animals randomly from each of three families. Thus,\nwe used a total of six animals, two females and four males.\nHowever, while it performed as well as the other animals, we had\nto discard data from one female because we applied an incorrect\ncriterion for successful training (two successful sessions in a row\ninstead of three). No animals were excluded from the experiment\nbecause of poor performance. Of the five animals used in the final\ndata analyses, the female was animal #5 in Figure 2 and this\nindividual did not differ from the other animals in terms of\nperformance. The animals were reared normally with their\nparents and littermates. Three to six animals were kept in a large\ncage (45670630 cm) that contained a metal running wheel, a\nwooden sleeping den and tunnel, nesting materials, a food cup,\nand a water supplier. Food pellets and water were freely available,\nand the animals were not deprived of food prior to the\nexperiments. The degus were kept in an animal room at the\nRIKEN Brain Science Institute under a fixed 12-h day, 12-h night\ncycle, with temperature around 22 uC and relative humidity\naround 50%. This experiment was approved by the RIKEN Brain\nScience Institute animal experiment committee#H18-2B012 and\ncomplied with the institutional regulations.\nApparatus\nTraining was carried out on a training platform made of acrylic\nboard (Fig. 5). The platform consisted of a training stage\n(2063067 cm) and a transparent fence (4565560.5 cm) that\nseparated the animal from the area where the food rewards and\ntools were placed. The fence was placed 1.5 cm above the training\nstage so that the degu could reach through with its forelimb and\ngrab the tool in its hand, but otherwise no restrictions or\nimpositions were placed on the animal’s mobility or actions. Each\nbar of the fence was 0.5 cm wide and bars were 1.5 cm apart. The\ntraining platform was placed on a table set inside a sound-isolation\nroom and the experimenter faced the degu across the table. The\nrake-like tool was T-shaped, with a wire shaft 4 cm long, a\nrectangular plate (3 cm wide61 cm high) made of acrylic resin,\nand a spherical grip 1 cm in diameter. The tool weighed 2.1 g.\nThe tool and food reward were placed outside the fence with the\nrake handle within the degu’s reach.\nA 4-inch LCD monitor (Logitech LCMTo42AS) was placed on\nthe left side of the platform, and a numeric pad was placed on the\nright so that the experimenter could measure the duration of each\ntrial and also could use it to advance the trial. The LCD monitor\nand the numeric pad were connected to a personal computer that\nwas programmed to function as an event recorder. Each training\nsession was monitored by two cameras (Sony DCR-PC110) at the\ntop and upper-left side of the platform, and recorded with a video\nrecorder (Panasonic VDR-M30). Recordings were analyzed off-\nline using motion analysis software (Noldus, Ethovision Color Pro).\nProcedures\n1. Habituation: Each animal was habituated to the training\nenvironment by placing it in the enclosure and giving it a piece of\nsunflower seed. The animal was then trained to obtain food placed\noutside the fence using its forearms. Next, the animal was\nhabituated to the rake tool. A reward was given when the animal\ntouched and dragged the rake. Habituation to the tool and the\nenvironment was completed in one session lasting around 1 h.\n2. Training: Training was carried out by the successive\napproximation method, modeled on the Japanese macaque’s\ntraining procedure. We did not use an auditory cue to shape\nbehavior in any phase of training. During each day of training, the\ndegu was put through one session that consisted of 35 to 45 trials.\nThe degus were trained 5 days a week. Each trial was set up by\nplacing a food item on the table beyond the degu’s reach, and then\nwas begun by placing the tool on the table while the experimenter\nsimultaneously pressed the numeric pad to mark the start of the\ntrial. The trial came to an end either when the degu successfully\nobtained the food or when 60 s had elapsed, which was marked by\nthe experimenter pressing the numeric pad. The duration of the\ntrial was defined as the time difference between the two key\nFigure 5. The experimental platform (middle), the TFT monitor\nfor event display (left), and the numeric pad for event\nrecording (right).The scale bar is inserted only as a rough reference\nbecause the photo is tilted. The degu was placed behind the fence and\nthe experimenter sat facing the animal from outside the enclosure.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001860.g005\nTool Use Training in a Rodent\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 March 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 3 | e1860\npresses. After the trial, the tool and food (if remaining) were\nwithdrawn from the platform and an intertrial interval of an\naverage of 9 s (range 3–30 s) followed. The food reward in each\ntrial was half a sunflower seed, the degus’ favorite treat. One-half\nof the skinned seed was given as reinforcement for each trial. The\ndegus performed for sunflower seeds without food deprivation.\nAt the beginning of the training (Level 1a), the reward was\nplaced close to the animal’s side of the rake blade (up to 1 cm\nbehind the blade and within 0.5 cm from the center of the blade)\nand the animal was trained to simply pull the tool. The distance\nbetween the tool and reward was then extended gradually (Level\n1b; within 1.5 cm). After the animal learned this task, we began to\nplace the reward at the side of the tool so that the animal had to\nmove the tool laterally before pulling it in (Level 2a). Finally, the\nfood was placedbeyond the tool so that the animal had to first push\nthe tool beyond the food, move it laterally, and then pull on it to\nget the food (Level 2b). In general, advancement through these\nsublevels occurred during sessions after a success rate over 50%\nwas attained. Five or more successful performances resulted in\nadvancement to Level 2b, while three failures in a row resulted in\nretraining under Level 2a.\nIn Level 1a, the degu could simply pull the tool straight toward\nitself since the food was placed adjacent to the near side of the\nplate (Fig. 1B). In Level 1b, the distance between the food and the\nplate was extended (2\nnd panel), but the degu could still obtain the\nfood by carefully pulling the tool straight toward itself (Movie S2).\nIn Level 2a, the food was displaced horizontally from the plate,\nrequiring the degu to make a lateral movement (3rd panel, s)\nbefore pulling the tool toward itself (3rd panel, t, Movie S3). In\nLevel 2b, the reward was placed beyond the plate (4th panel,\nMovie S4), thus requiring the degu to swivel and push the tool\nbeyond the reward and then adjust the relative position between\nthe reward and the plate before pulling it toward itself. In practice,\nLevel 2a and Level 2b were not clearly distinguishable because\nwhen an attempt to pull the reward failed in Level 2a training, the\nfollowing trial had a Level 2b setting. At this final level, advanced\nbehavioral planning was required for efficient retrieval of the food\nreward.\nIn the initial stage of training, after the degu pulled the tool once\nwithout success, it often hit the tool by the nose from several\ndirections without further trying to retrieve the reward with the\ntool. After several failures, it often jumped off the platform or bit\nthe fence. These behaviors suggest that the degu had no\nunderstanding of the function of the tool. In the middle stage of\ntraining, the degu gradually came to retry efforts several times\nafter an initial failure to retrieve the reward. The degu came to\nexamine the relative position of the food and the tool, without\ncontinuing to hold or manipulate the tool. It began to shake the\ntool to the left and right, and then gradually learned to push and\npull the tool. These behaviors suggest that the degu began to\nappreciate the function of the tool. In the final stage of training,\nthe degu always paid a great deal attention to the relative position\nof the tool and the reward. At this stage, it often pulled the tool\ntoward itself presumably to gain control over the tool before it\ntried to retrieve the food. At this stage, the degu tended not to\nabandon the trial after an initial failure, and continued retrying\nuntil it gained the reward.\n3. Probe tests: After the tool-use training, the following probe\ntests were administered to examine the degus’ functional\nunderstanding of the tool (Fig 4, Table 1). We ran each animal\nthrough each probe test ten times. Probe tests consisted of the\nfollowing: A) Contingency reversal test (Movie S9), B) General-\nization test (Movie S10), C) Functionality test 1 (Movie S11), D)\nFunctionality test 2 (Movie S12), and E) Preference test (Movie\nS13). For more details, see Figure 4 and Table 1. We restricted the\nnumber of trials for each probe test to be ten to avoid loss of\nstimulus control over the tool and also to avoid giving a new set of\ntrainings to the probe tools. For tests C, D, and E we performed\nstatistical tests to examine animals’ tendency to select a particular\ntool. Since the number of probe trials was small, we performed\nbinomial tests on the pooled data of four animals (sums up to 40\ntrials) and tested whether the animals as a group selected one of\nthe tools significantly more often.\nSupporting Information\nMovie S1 Video clip depicting Degus’ typical tool-use behavior,\ncorresponding to Fig. 1A.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001860.s001 (2.40 MB\nMPG)\nMovie S2 Video clip depicting Level 1b tool-use behavior\npresented at half speed (15 frames/sec; normal speed is 30 frames/\nsec).
