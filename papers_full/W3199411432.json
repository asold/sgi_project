While\nhighly successful, these methods come at the cost\nof interpretability as it has become increasingly un-\nclear what relationships they capture. Yet, as their\npresence in society increases, so does the impor-\ntance of recognising the role they play in perpetu-\nating social biases. In this regard, Bolukbasi et al.\n(2016) ﬁrst discovered that contextualized word\nrepresentations reﬂect gender biases captured in the\ntraining data. What followed was a suite of stud-\nies that aimed to quantify and mitigate the effect\nof harmful social biases in word (Caliskan et al.,\n2017) and sentence encoders (May et al., 2019).\nDespite these studies, it has remained difﬁcult to\ndeﬁne what constitutes “bias”, with most work fo-\ncusing on “gender bias” (Manela et al., 2021; Sun\net al., 2019) or “racial bias” (Davidson et al., 2019;\nSap et al., 2019). More broadly, biases in the mod-\nels can comprise a wide range of harmful behaviors\nthat may affect different social groups for various\nreasons (Blodgett et al., 2020).\nIn this work, we take a different focus and study\nstereotypes that emerge within pretrained LMs in-\nstead. While bias is a personal preference that can\nbe harmful when the tendency interferes with the\nability to be impartial, stereotypes can be deﬁned\nas a preconceived idea that (incorrectly) attributes\ngeneral characteristics to all members of a group.\nWhile the two concepts are closely related i.e.,\nstereotypes can evoke new biases or reinforce exist-\ning ones, stereotypical thinking appears to be a cru-\ncial part of human cognition that often emerges im-\nplicitly (Hinton, 2017). Hinton (2017) argued that\nimplicit stereotypical associations are established\nthrough Bayesian principles, where the experience\nof their prevalence in the world of the perceiver\ncauses the association. Thus, as stereotypical asso-\nciations are not solely reﬂections of cognitive bias\nbut also stem from real data, we suspect that our\nmodels, like human individuals, pick up on these\nassociations. This is particularly true given that\ntheir knowledge is largely considered to be a reﬂec-\ntion of the data they are trained on. Yet, while we\nconsider stereotypical thinking to be a natural side-\neffect of learning, it is still important to be aware\nof the stereotypes that models encode. Psychology\nstudies show that beliefs about social groups are\ntransmitted and shaped through language (Maass,\n1999; Beukeboom and Burgers, 2019). Thus, spe-\nciﬁc lexical choices in downstream applications\nnot only reﬂect the model’s attitude towards groups\nbut may also inﬂuence the audience’s reaction to it,\nthereby inadvertently propagating the stereotypes\nthey capture (Park et al., 2020).\nStudies focused on measuring stereotypes in pre-\ntrained models have thus far taken supervised ap-\nproaches, relying on human knowledge of common\nstereotypes about (a smaller set of) social groups\n1478\n(Nadeem et al., 2020; Nangia et al., 2020). This,\nhowever, bears a few disadvantages: (1) due to the\nimplicit nature of stereotypes, human deﬁned ex-\namples can only expose a subset of popular stereo-\ntypes, but will omit those that human annotators\nare unaware of (e.g. models might encode stereo-\ntypes that are not as prevalent in the real world);\n(2) stereotypes vary considerably across cultures\n(Dong et al., 2019), meaning that the stereotypes\ntested for will heavily depend on the annotator’s\ncultural frame of reference; (3) stereotypes con-\nstantly evolve, making supervised methods difﬁ-\ncult to maintain in practice. Therefore, similar to\nField and Tsvetkov (2020), we advocate the need\nfor implicit approaches to expose and quantify bias\nand stereotypes in pretrained models.\nWe present the ﬁrst dataset of stereotypical at-\ntributes of a wide range of social groups, com-\nprising ∼2K attributes in total. Furthermore, we\npropose a stereotype elicitation method that en-\nables the retrieval of salient attributes of social\ngroups encoded by state-of-the-art LMs in an un-\nsupervised manner. We use this method to test the\nextent to which models encode the human stereo-\ntypes captured in our dataset. Moreover, we are the\nﬁrst to demonstrate how training data at the ﬁne-\ntuning stage can directly affect stereotypical associ-\nations within the models. In addition, we propose\na complementary method to study stereotypes in a\nmore generalized way through the use of emotion\nproﬁles, and systematically compare the emerging\nemotion proﬁles for different social groups across\nmodels. We ﬁnd that all models vary considerably\nin the information they encode, with some models\nbeing overall more negatively biased while others\nare mostly positive instead. Yet, in contrast to pre-\nvious work, this study is not meant to advocate the\nneed for debiasing. Instead, it is meant to expose\nvarying implicit stereotypes that different models\nincorporate and to bring awareness to how quickly\nattitudes towards groups change based on contex-\ntual differences in the training data used both at the\npretraining and ﬁne-tuning stage.\n2 Related work\nPrevious work on stereotypes While studies\nthat explicitly focus on stereotypes have remained\nlimited in NLP, several works on bias touch upon\nthis topic (Blodgett et al., 2020). This includes, for\ninstance, studying speciﬁc phenomena such as the\ninfamous ‘Angry Black Woman’ stereotype and the\n‘double bind’ (Heilman et al., 2004) theory (Kir-\nitchenko and Mohammad, 2018; May et al., 2019;\nTan and Celis, 2019), or relating model predictions\nto gender stereotype lexicons (Field and Tsvetkov,\n2020). To the best of our knowledge, Nadeem\net al. (2020); Nangia et al. (2020) and Manela et al.\n(2021) are the ﬁrst to explicitly study stereotypes in\npretrained sentence encoders. While Manela et al.\n(2021) focus on gender stereotypes using the Wino-\nBias dataset (Zhao et al., 2018), the other works\npropose new crowdsourced datasets (i.e. StereoSet\nand Crowspair) with stereotypes that cover a wide\nrange of social groups. All datasets, however, have\na similar set-up: they contain pairs of sentences\nof which one is more stereotypical than the other.\nWorking in the language modeling framework, they\nevaluated whether the model \"prefers\" the stereo-\ntypical sentence over the anti-stereotypical one. In\ncontrast, we propose a different experimental setup\nand introduce a new dataset that leverages search\nengines’ autocomplete suggestions for the acquisi-\ntion of explicit stereotypical attributes. Instead of\nindirectly uncovering stereotypes through compari-\nson, our elicitation method directly retrieves salient\nattributes encoded in the models. Our technique\nis inspired by Kurita et al. (2019), but while they\nmeasure the LM probability for completing sen-\ntences with the pronouns she and he speciﬁcally,\nwe study the top ksalient attributes without posing\nany restrictions on what these could be. Moreover,\nwe are the ﬁrst to include both monolingual and\nmultilingual models in our analysis.\nStereotype-driven emotions Stereotypes are\nconstantly changing and identifying negative ones\nin particular, is an inherently normative process.\nWhile some stereotypes clearly imply disrespect\n(e.g., women are incompetent), others emerge from\nexcessive competence instead (e.g., Asians are\ngood at math). Moreover, stereotypical content\nis heavily inﬂuenced by the social pressures of so-\nciety at the time. Cuddy et al. (2009) argue that\nno stereotype remains stable and predictable from\ntheoretical principles. Hence, many social psychol-\nogists have abandoned the study of stereotype con-\ntent to focus on systematic principles that general-\nize across different speciﬁc instances of stereotypes\ninstead, presumably making them more stable over\ntime and place (Cuddy et al., 2009; Mackie et al.,\n2000; Weiner, 1993). Similarly, we explore a more\nrobust approach to uncovering stereotypes in pre-\ntrained LMs by studying how stereotypes are more\ngenerally manifested as varying emotion proﬁles in\n1479\nSearch query Category Social group Stereotypical attributes Search engine\nWhy are black people so race black people fast, athletic, hated, angry, loud Yahoo\nWhy are british people so race british people polite, pale, tall, reserved, cold DuckDuckGo\nWhy are californians so lifestyle californians entitled, rich, ﬂaky, backstabby multiple\nWhy are comedians so profession comedians funny, sad, intelligent, depressed Google\nWhy are millennials so age millennials fragile, nostalgic, lonely, broke Google\nWhy is Norway so country Norway healthy, wealthy, happy, rich multiple\nWhy are conservatives so political conservatives angry, controlling, racist Yahoo\nWhy are mormons so religion mormons misunderstood, rich, succesful, nice multiple\nTable 1: A few (random) examples of stereotypical attributes sampled from the dataset. Note that the number of\nattributes vary as we do not retrieve the same number for each social group per search engine.\nthe models. Previous works show that groups evoke\ndifferent emotional proﬁles (Cottrell and Neuberg,\n2005; Tapias et al., 2007; Mackie et al., 2000), and\na variety of theories link particular intergroup rela-\ntions to distinct stereotype-driven emotions such as\ndisgust and anger (Harris and Fiske, 2006, 2009).\n3 Stereotypes from search engines\nRetrieving human stereotypes in an implicit man-\nner can be useful as people are likely to give more\npolitically correct answers when asked for stereo-\ntypes explicitly. Questions we ask to search en-\ngines are often done in the comfort of our own\nhomes, making them likely to reﬂect true stereo-\ntypes that are out there in the real world (Stephens-\nDavidowitz, 2018). When feeding search engines\nqueries that already imply a stereotype about a spe-\nciﬁc social group, the suggested completions are\noften salient (i.e. stereotypical) attributes of that\nparticular group e.g., search query: ‘Why are Asian\nparents so’ →completion: ‘strict’. As the auto-\ncomplete suggestions are based on popular human\ngenerated queries, we exploit this property for the\nacquisition of stereotypical attributes.\nSocial groups We use 382 social groups which\nwe divide into 9 categories: age (11), gender (26),\nprofession (115), race (99), country (73), religion\n(10), political (9), sexuality (12) and lifestyle (19).\nSee Appendix C for the full lists of social groups\nper category. The social groups include, but are not\nlimited to, the ones used by Nadeem et al. (2020)\nwho collected Wikidata relation triples to automati-\ncally retrieve target terms.\nTemplates To increase coverage, we design 5\nslightly varying templates to retrieve autocomplete\nsuggestions for. For groups pertaining to people\nwe use the templates:\n• ‘Why are[TGT] so [ATTR] ?’\n• ‘What makes[TGT] so [ATTR]?’\n• ‘How come[TGT] are so [ATTR]?’\n• ‘Why are[TGT] always so [ATTR]?’\n• ‘Why are all[TGT] so [ATTR]?’\nFor countries we use:\n• ‘Why is[TGT] so [ATTR] ?’\n• ‘What makes[TGT] so [ATTR]?’\n• ‘How come[TGT] is so [ATTR]?’\n• ‘Why is[TGT] always so [ATTR]?’\n• ‘Why are all people in[TGT] so [ATTR]?’\nwhere [TGT] are social groups for which we\nsearch stereotypes and [ATTR] is the salient at-\ntribute with which the search engine completes the\nsequence. We tested other (longer and more elab-\norate) templates but we found that they did not\nproduce many autocomplete suggestions. In fact,\nwe believe that the above queries are so success-\nful precisely because of their simplicity, given that\npeople are likely to keep search queries concise.\nSearch engines Due to Google’s hate speech ﬁl-\ntering system the autocompletion feature is dis-\nabled for frequently targeted groups e.g. black peo-\nple, Jewish people and members of the LGBTQ+\ncommunity. Thus, we retrieve autocomplete sug-\ngestions from 3 search engines: Google, Yahoo\nand DuckDuckGo. In many cases, identical com-\npletions were given by multiple search engines.\nWe sort these duplicate samples under the category\n‘multiple engines’. We ﬁnd that most negative (of-\nfensive) stereotypes are retrieved from Yahoo.\nPre-processing We clean up the dataset manu-\nally, using the following procedure:\n1. Remove noisy completions that do not result\nin a grammatically correct sentence e.g. non\nadjectives.\n2. Remove speciﬁc trend-sensitive references:\ne.g. to video games ‘why are asians so good\nat league of legends’.\n3. Remove neutral statements not indicative of\nstereotypes e.g. ‘why are[TGT] so called’.\n4. We ﬁlter out completions consisting of mul-\n1480\ntiple words.1 Yet, when possible, the input\nis altered such that only the key term has to\nbe predicted by the model e.g., ‘Why arerus-\nsians so x’, where x = good at playing chess\n→‘Why arerussians so good at x’, x = chess.\nThe ﬁnal dataset contains∼2K stereotypes about\n274 social groups. The stereotypes are distributed\nacross categories as follows – profession: 713, race:\n412, country: 396, gender: 198, age: 171, lifestyle:\n123, political: 50, religion: 36. None of the search\nengines produce stereotypical autocomplete sug-\ngestions for members of the LGBTQ+ community.\nIn Table 1 we provide some examples from the\ndataset. See Appendix B for more details on the\ndata acquisition and search engines. The full code\nand dataset are publicly available.2\n4 Correlating human stereotypes with\nsalient attributes in pretrained models\nTo test for human stereotypes, we propose a stereo-\ntype elicitation method that is inspired by cloze\ntesting, a technique that stems from psycholinguis-\ntics. Using our method we retrieve salient attributes\nfrom the model in an unsupervised manner and\ncompute recall scores over the stereotypes captured\nin our search engine dataset.\nPretrained models We study different types\nof pretrained LMs of which 3 are monolingual\nand 2 multilingual: BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)\nuncased trained on the BooksCorpus dataset\n(Zhu et al., 2015) and English Wikipedia;\nRoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), the optimized ver-\nsion of BERT that is in addition trained on\ndata from CommonCrawl News (Nagel, 2016),\nOpenWebTextCorpus (Gokaslan and Cohen,\n2019) and STORIES (Trinh and Le, 2018); BART,\na denoising autoencoder (Lewis et al., 2020) that\nwhile using a different architecture and pretrain-\ning strategy from RoBERTa, uses the same train-\ning data. Moreover, we use mBERT, that apart\nfrom being trained onWikipedia in multiple lan-\nguages, is identical to BERT. We use the uncased\nversion that supports 102 languages. Similarly,\nXLM-R is the multilingual variant of RoBERTa\n(Conneau et al., 2020) that is trained on cleaned\nCommonCrawl data (Wenzek et al., 2020) and\n1Although incompatible with our set-up, we do not remove\nthem from the dataset as they can be valuable in future studies.\n2https://github.com/RochelleChoenni/\nstereotypes_in_lms\nTable 2: Ranking:‘why are\nold people so bad with’.\nPrior Post\n1. memory 1. memory\n2. math 2. alcohol\n3. money 3. technology\n4. children 4. dates\nsupports 100 lan-\nguages. We include\nboth versions of a\nmodel (i.e. Base and\nLarge) if available.\nAppendix A provides\nmore details on the\nmodels.\nStereotype elicitation method For each sample\nin our dataset we feed the model the template sen-\ntence and replace [ATTR] with the [MASK] to-\nken. We then retrieve the top k = 200 model\npredictions for the MASK token, and test how many\nof the stereotypes found by the search engines are\nalso encoded in the LMs. We adapt the method\nfrom Kurita et al. (2019) to rank the top kreturned\nmodel outputs based on their typicality for the re-\nspective social group. We quantify typicality by\ncomputing the log probability of the model proba-\nbility for the predicted completion corrected for by\nthe prior probability of the completion e.g.:\nPpost(y= strict|Why are parents so y?) (1)\nPprior(y= strict|Why are [MASK] so y?) (2)\np= log(Ppost/Pprior) (3)\ni.e., measuring association between the words by\ncomputing the chance of completing the template\nwith ‘strict’ given ‘parents’ corrected by the prior\nchance of ‘strict’ given any other group. Note that\nEq. 3 has been well-established as a measure for\nstereotypicality in research from both social psy-\nchology (McCauley et al., 1980) and economics\n(Bordalo et al., 2016). After re-ranking by typical-\nity, we evaluate how many of the stereotypes are\ncorrectly retrieved by the model through recall@k\nfor each of the 8 target categories.\nResults Figure 1 shows the recall@kscores per\nmodel separated by category, showcasing the abil-\nity to directly retrieve stereotypical attributes of\nsocial groups using our elicitation method. While\nmodels capture the human stereotypes to similar\nextents, results vary when comparing across cat-\negories with most models obtaining the highest\nrecall for country stereotypes. Multilingual models\nobtain relatively low scores when recalling stereo-\ntypical attributes pertaining to age, gender and po-\nlitical groups. Yet, XLMR-L is scoring relatively\nhigh on stereotypical profession and race attributes.\n1481\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8Recall\nReligion\nBERT-B\nBERT-L\nRoBERT a-B\nRoBERT a-L\nBART-B\nBART-L\nmBERT\nXLMR-B\nXLMR-L\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nAge\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nCountry\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nGender\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8Recall\nPolitical\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nProfession\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nRace\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nLifestyle\nFigure 1: Recall@k scores for recalling the human-deﬁned stereotypes captured in our dataset using our stereotype\nelicitation method on various pretrained LMs.\nThe suboptimal performance of multilingual mod-\nels could be explained in different ways. For in-\nstance, as multilingual models are known to suffer\nfrom negative interference (Wang et al., 2020), their\nquality on individual languages is lower compared\nto monolingual models, due to limited model ca-\npacity. This could result in a loss of stereotypical\ninformation. Alternatively, multilingual models\nare trained on more culturally diverse data, thus\nconﬂicting information could counteract within the\nmodel with stereotypes from different languages\ndampening each other’s effect. Cultural differences\nmight also be more pronounced when it comes to\ne.g. age and gender, whilst profession and race\nstereotypes might be established more universally.\n5 Quantifying emotion towards different\nsocial groups\nTo study stereotypes through emotion, we draw\ninspiration from psychology studies showing that\nstereotypes evoke distinct emotions based on dif-\nferent types of perceived threats (Cottrell and Neu-\nberg, 2005) or perceived social status and compet-\nitiveness of the targeted group (Fiske, 1998). For\ninstance, Cottrell and Neuberg (2005) show that\nboth feminists and African Americans elicit anger,\nbut while the former group is perceived as a threat\nto social values, the latter is perceived as a threat to\nproperty instead. Thus, the stereotypes that under-\nlie the emotion are likely different. Whilst strong\nemotions are not evidence of stereotypes per se,\nthey do suggest the powerful effects of subtle bi-\nases captured in the model. Thus, the study into\nemotion proﬁles provides us with a good starting\npoint to identify which stereotypes associated with\nthe social groups evoke those emotions. To this\nend, we (1) build emotion proﬁles for social groups\nin the models and (2) retrieve stereotypes about the\ngroups that most strongly elicit emotions.\nModel predictions To measure the emotions en-\ncoded by the model, we feed the model the 5 stereo-\ntype eliciting templates for each social group and\nretrieve the top 200 predictions for the [MASK]\ntoken (1000 in total). When taking the 1000 salient\nattributes retrieved from the 5 templates, we see\nthat there are many overlapping predictions, hence\nwe are left with only approx. between 300-350\nunique attributes per social group. This indicates\nthat the returned model predictions are robust with\nregard to the different templates.\nEmotion scoring For each group, we score the\npredicted set of stereotypical attributes WTGT us-\ning the NRC emotion lexicon (Mohammad and\nTurney, 2013) that contains ∼14K English words\nthat are manually annotated with Ekman’s eight ba-\nsic emotions (fear, joy, anticipation, trust, surprise,\nsadness, anger, and disgust) (Ekman, 1999) and\ntwo sentiments (negative and positive). These emo-\ntions are considered basic as they are thought to\nbe shaped by natural selection to address survival-\nrelated problems, which is often denoted as a driv-\ning factor for stereotyping (Cottrell and Neuberg,\n2005). We use the annotations that consist of a\nbinary value (i.e. 0 or 1) for each of the emotion\ncategories; words can have multiple underlying\nemotions (e.g. selﬁsh is annotated with ‘negative’,\n‘anger’ and ‘disgust’) or none at all (e.g. vocal\nscores 0 on all categories). We ﬁnd that the cover-\nage for the salient attributes in the NRC lexicon is\n≈70-75 % per group.\n1482\nWe score groups by counting the frequencies\nwith which the predicted attributes WTGT are asso-\nciated with the emotions and sentiments. For each\ngroup, we remove attributes from WTGT that are\nnot covered in the lexicon. Thus, we do not extract\nemotion scores for the exact same number of at-\ntributes per group (number of unique attributes and\ncoverage in the lexicon vary). Thus, we normalize\nscores per group by the number of words for which\nwe are able to retrieve emotion scores (≈210-250\nper group). The score of an emotion-group pair is\ncomputed as follows:\nsemo(TGT) =\n|WTGT |∑\ni=w\nNRCemo(i)/(|WTGT |) (4)\nWe then deﬁne emotion vectors ˆv∈R10 for each\ngroup TGT: ˆvTGT = [sfear ,sjoy,ssadness,strust\n,ssurprise,santicipation,sdisgust,sanger,snegative,\n,spositive], which we use as a representation for\nthe emotion proﬁles within the model.\nAnalysis Figure 2, provides examples of the emo-\ntion proﬁles encoded for a diverse set of social\ngroups to demonstrate how these proﬁles allow us\nto expose stereotypes. For instance, we see that\nin RoBERTa-B religious people and liberals are\nprimarily associated with attributes that underlie\nanger. Towards homosexuals, the same amount of\nanger is accompanied by disgust and fear as well.\nAs a result, we can detect distinct salient attributes\nthat contribute to these emotions e.g.: Christians\nare intense, misguided and perverse, liberals are\nphony, mad and rabid, whilst homosexuals aredirty,\nbad, ﬁlthy, appalling, gross and indecent. The ﬁnd-\ning that homosexuals elicit relatively much disgust\ncan be conﬁrmed by studies on humans as well\n(Cottrell and Neuberg, 2005). Similarly, we ﬁnd\nthat Greece and Puerto Rico elicit relatively much\nfear and sadness in RoBERTa-B. Whereas Puerto\nRico is turbulent, battered, armed, precarious and\nhaunted, for Greece we ﬁnd attributes such as fail-\ning, crumbling, inefﬁcient, stagnant and paralyzed.\nEmotion proﬁles elicited in BART-B differ con-\nsiderably, showcasing how vastly sentiments vary\nacross models. In particular, we see that overall\nthe evoked emotion responses are weaker. More-\nover, we detect relative differences such as liberals\nbeing more negatively associated than homosexu-\nals, encoding attributes such as cowardly, greedy\nand hypocritical. We also ﬁnd that BART-B en-\ncodes more positive associations e.g., committed,\nneg.\npos.\ndisgust\nanger\nfear\nsad\ntrust\njoy\nreligionists \nhomosexuals\nliberals\nblack people\nwhite people\nscots\nPuerto RicoGreece\nstrippers\nhusbands\npoor peopleteenagers\nRoBERTa-B\nneg.\npos.\ndisgust\nanger\nfear\nsad\ntrust\njoy\nBART-B\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nFigure 2: Examples of emotion proﬁles for a diverse\nset of social groups from RoBERTa-B and BART-B.\nreliable, noble and responsible contributing to trust\nfor husbands. Interestingly, all multilingual mod-\nels encode vastly more positive attributes for all\nsocial groups (see Apppendix D). We expect that\nthis might be an artefact of the training data, but\nleave further investigation of this for future work.\nComparison across models We systematically\ncompare the emotion proﬁles elicited by the so-\ncial groups across different models by adapting\nthe Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)\nfrom Kriegeskorte et al. (2008). We opted for this\nmethod as it takes the relative relations between\ngroups within the same model into account. This\nis particularly important as we have seen that some\nmodels are overall more negatively or positively\nbiased. Yet, when it comes to bias and stereotypi-\ncality, we are less interested in absolute differences\nacross models, but rather in how emotions differ to-\nwards groups in relation to the other groups. First,\nthe representational similarity within each model\nis deﬁned using a similarity measure to construct a\nrepresentational similarity matrix (RSM). We de-\nﬁne a similarity vector ˆwTGT for a social group\nsuch that every element ˆwij of the vector is deter-\nmined by the cosine similarity between ˆvi, where\ni= TGT, and the vector ˆvj for the j-th group in the\nlist. The RSM is then deﬁned as the symmetric ma-\ntrix consisting of all similarity vectors. The result-\ning matrices are then compared across models by\ncomputing the Spearman correlation (ρ) between\nthe similarity vectors corresponding to the emotion\nproﬁles for a group in a model aand b. To express\nthe similarity between the two models we take the\nmean correlation over all social groups in our list.\nResults Computing RSA over all categories com-\nbined, shows us that RoBERTa-B and BART-B ob-\n1483\nBERT-B\nNewYorkerGuardianReutersFoxNewsBreitbart\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nGender - Spearman Correlation\nBERT-B\nNewYorkerGuardianReutersFoxNewsBreitbart\nBERT-B\nNewYorker\nGuardian\nReuters\nFoxNews\nBreitbart\n0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nAge - Spearman Correlation\nFigure 3: Correlations in emotion proﬁles for gender\nand age groups across news sources (BERT-B).\ntain the highest correlation (ρ = 0 .44). While\nusing different architectures and pretraining strate-\ngies, the models rely on the same training data. Yet,\nwe included base and large versions of models in\nour study and ﬁnd that these models show little to\nno correlation (see Appendix E, Fig.10). This is\nsurprising, as they are pretrained on the same data\nand tasks as their base versions (but contain more\nmodel parameters e.g. through additional layers).\nThis shows how complex the process is in which\nassociations are established and provides strong\nevidence that other modelling decisions, apart from\ntraining data, contribute to what models learn about\ngroups. Thus, carefully controlling training content\ncan not fully eliminate the need to analyze models\nw.r.t. the stereotypes that they might propagate.\n6 Stereotype shifts during ﬁne-tuning\nMany debiasing studies intervene at the data level\ne.g., by augmenting imbalanced datasets (Manela\net al., 2021; Webster et al., 2018; Dixon et al., 2018;\nZhao et al., 2018) or reducing annotator bias (Sap\net al., 2019). These methods are, however, depen-\ndent on the dataset, domain, or task, making new\nmitigation needed when transferring to a new set-\nup (Jin et al., 2020). This raises the question of how\nemotion proﬁles and stereotypes are established\nthrough language use, and how they might shift\ndue to new linguistic experience at the ﬁne-tuning\nstage. We take U.S. news sources from across the\npolitical spectrum as a case study, as media outlets\nare known to be biased (Baron, 2006). By revealing\nstereotypes learned as an effect of ﬁne-tuning on\na speciﬁc source, we can trace the newly learned\nstereotypes back to the respective source.\nWe rely on the political bias categorisation of\nnews sources from the AllSides 3 media bias rating\nwebsite. These ratings are retrieved using multiple\n3https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/\nmedia-bias-ratings\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7Recall\nReuters\nBERT-B\nreuters-100\nreuters-50\nreuters-25\nreuters-10\n0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200\nk\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7 New Yorker\nBERT-B\nnew_yorker-100\nnew_yorker-50\nnew_yorker-25\nnew_yorker-10\nFigure 4: Effect on recall@k when ﬁne-tuning BERT-B\non 10, 25, 50 and 100 % of the data\n100%50%25%10%\nProportion of data\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\nSpearman Correlation\nSource\nNew Yorker\nGuardian\nReuters\nFOX news\nBreitbart\nFigure 5: Decrease in Spearman correlation ( ∆ρ) after\nﬁne-tuning the pretrained models compared to no ﬁne-\ntuning (∆ρ = 1) (no correlation left: ∆ρ = −1).

Based on these rat-\nings we select the following sources: New Yorker\n(far left ), The Guardian ( left), Reuters ( center),\nFOX News (right) and Breitbart (far right). From\neach news source we take 4354 articles from the\nAll-The-News4 dataset that contains articles from\n27 American Publications collected between 2013\nand early 2020. We ﬁne-tune the 5 base models 5\non these news sources using the MLM objective\nfor only 1 training epoch with a learning rate of\n5e-5 and a batch size of 8 using the HuggingFace\nlibrary (Wolf et al., 2020). We then quantify the\nemotion shift after ﬁne-tuning using RSA.\nResults We ﬁnd that ﬁne-tuning on news sources\ncan directly alter the encoded stereotypes.

Removed attributes are red and those\nadded green. Attributes that persisted are grey.\nrugby are lost. Moreover, from ﬁne-tuning on both\nBreitbart and FOX news the association emerges\nthat black women are violent, while this is not the\ncase when ﬁne-tuning on the other sources.\nIn fact, Guardian and Breitbart are the only news\nsources that result in the encoding of the salient\nattribute racist for White Americans. We ﬁnd that\nsuch shifts are already visible after training on as\nlittle as 25% of the original data (∼1K articles).\nWhen comparing to human stereotypes, we ﬁnd\nthat ﬁne-tuning on Reuters decreases the overall\nrecall scores (see Figure 4). Although New Yorker\nexhibits a similar trend, ﬁne-tuning on the other\nsources have little effect on the number of stereo-\ntypes recalled from the dataset. As Reuters has a\ncenter bias rating i.e., it does not predictably fa-\nvor either end of the political spectrum, we specu-\nlate that large amounts of more nuanced data helps\ntransmit fewer stereotypes.\nFigure 5 shows the decrease in correlation be-\ntween the emotion proﬁles from pretrained BERT-\nB and BERT-B ﬁne-tuned on different propor-\ntions of the data. Interestingly, ﬁne-tuning on less\narticles does not automatically result in smaller\nchanges to the models. In fact, in many cases, the\namount of relative change in emotion proﬁles is\nheavily dependent on the social category as indi-\ncated by the error bars. This is not unexpected as\nnews sources might propagate stronger opinions\nabout speciﬁc categories. Moreover, we ﬁnd that\nemotions towards different social categories cannot\nalways be distinguished by the political bias of the\nsource. Figure 3, shows how news sources com-\npare to each other w.r.t. different social categories,\nexposing that e.g. Guardian and FOX news show\nlower correlation on gender than on age.\nComputing correlation between all pretrained\nand ﬁne-tuned models, we ﬁnd that emotion pro-\nﬁles are prone to change irrespective of model or\nnews source (see Appendix E). In Figure 6, we\nshowcase the effect of ﬁne-tuning from the model\nthat exhibits the lowest change in correlation, i.e.\nRoBERTa-B, to highlight how quickly emotions\nshift. We ﬁnd that while Reuters results in weaker\nemotional responses, Guardian elicits stronger neg-\native emotions than FOX news e.g. towards con-\nservatives and academics. Yet, while both sources\nresult in anger towards similar groups, for FOX\nnews anger is more often accompanied with fear\nwhile for Guardian this seems to more strongly\nstems from disgust (e.g. see Christians and Iraq).\nLastly, Figure 7 shows speciﬁc stereotype shifts\nfound on the top 15 predictions per template. We\n1485\nillustrate the salient attributes that are removed,\nadded and remained constant after ﬁne-tuning. For\ninstance, the role of news media in shaping public\nopinion about police has received much attention\nin the wake of the growing polarization over high-\nproﬁle incidents (Intravia et al., 2018; Graziano,\n2019). We ﬁnd clear evidence of this polarization\nas ﬁne-tuning on New Yorker results in attributes\nsuch as cold, unreliable, deadly and inept, yet, ﬁne-\ntuning on FOX news yields positive associations\nsuch as polite, loyal, cautious and exceptional. In\naddition, we ﬁnd evidence for other stark contrasts\nsuch as the model picking up on sexist (e.g. women\nare not interesting and equal but late, insecure and\nentitled) and racist stereotypes (e.g. black peo-\nple are not misunderstood and powerful, but bitter,\nrude and stubborn) after ﬁne-tuning on FOX news.\n7 Conclusion\nWe present the ﬁrst dataset containing stereotyp-\nical attributes of a range of social groups. Im-\nportantly, our data acquisition technique enables\nthe inexpensive retrieval of similar datasets in the\nfuture, enabling comparative analysis on stereo-\ntype shifts over time. Additionally, our proposed\nmethods could inspire future work on analyzing\nthe effect of training data content, and simultane-\nously contribute to the ﬁeld of social psychology\nby providing a testbed for studies on how stereo-\ntypes emerge from linguistic experience. To this\nend, we have shown that our methods can be used\nto identify stereotypes evoked during ﬁne-tuning\nby taking news sources as a case study. More-\nover, we have exposed how quickly stereotypes\nand emotions shift based on training data content,\nand linked stereotypes to their manifestations as\nemotions to quantify and compare attitudes towards\ngroups within LMs. We plan to extent our approach\nto more languages in future work to collect differ-\nent, more culturally dependent, stereotypes as well.\n8 Ethical consideration\nThe examples given in the paper can be considered\noffensive but are in no way a reﬂection of the au-\nthors’ own values and beliefs and should not be\ntaken as such. Moreover, it is important to note that\nfor the ﬁne-tuning experiments only a few interest-\ning examples were studied and showcased. Hence,\nmore thorough research should be conducted be-\nfore drawing any hard conclusions about the news\npapers and the stereotypes they propagate. In ad-\ndition, our data acquisition process is completely\nautomated and did not require the help from human\nsubjects. While the stereotypes we retrieve stem\nfrom real humans, the data we collect is publicly\navailable and completely anonymous as the speciﬁc\nstereotypical attributes and/or search queries can\nnot be traced back to individual users.\nReferences\nDavid P Baron. 2006.

We enter the search\nqueries anonymously such that the resulting suggestions are mainly based on common queries from other\npeople’s search histories. Unfortunately, however, exact details about the workings of the algorithms are\nnot publicly available, but an extensive explanation of Google’s search predictions can be found here:\nGoogle’s documentation on autocomplete suggestions. Moreover, Figure B illustrates the contribution of\neach search engine to the datasets. We see that while each search engine relies on a different algorithm,\nin many cases the engines predict similar stereotypical attributes regardless. Moreover, the dataset was\nconstructed during the period January-May 2021. However, given that the algorithms behind these engines\nare constantly evolving, it is not guaranteed that the same approach will yield identical results in the future.\nWe will make the dataset and corresponding code available upon publication.\nGoogle Yahoo duckduckgo multiple\nSearch engines\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000Samples\nSample distribution over search engines\nFigure 8: Distribution of
