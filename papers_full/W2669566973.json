The Smart Transformer (ST) is a SST that provides  ancillary \nservices to the distribution and transmission grids in order to optimize the ir performance. Hence, the focus shifts \nfrom hardware advantages to functionalities. One of the most desired functionality is the DC connectivity to enable \na hybrid distribution system . For this reason, t he ST architecture shall be composed of at least two power stages. \nThe standard design procedure for this kind of system is to design each power stage for the maximum load. However, \nthis design approach might limit the additional services , like the reactive power compensation on the MV side  and \nit does not take into account the load regulation capability of the Smart Transformer on the low voltage side . If the \nSST is tailored to the services that it shall provide, different stages have different design, so that the ST is not a mere \napplication of the SST anymore, but an entirely new subject. \nI. Introduction  \nThe integration of renewable energy systems and new loads, like EVs, has changed the distribution grid. The grid, \nonce passive and static with limited amount of distributed generators, is now active and dynamic. The LV grid hosts, \ntogether with the residential and commercial loads, small size generators, in the range of hundreds of Watt to few \nhundreds of kW. This generation capability consists of diesel generators, gas microturbines, photovoltaics and micro \nwind turbines. Among these resources, there are the controllable ones (diesel and gas generators) and the ones, called \nrenewables, that provide energy when available from natural sources (e.g., wind, sun irradiation, tides). \nThe last category has two main features: high power injection variability and distributed presence in the distribution \ngrid. These generation units vary their power output with short -term forecast possibilities and not at t he same time \ndue to the different geographical distribution. The major challenges for the grid are the voltage control, frequency \nstability, reverse power flow, and protection systems coordination [1,3]. \nThe Smart Transformer, a Solid State Transformer wit h control and communication functionalities, can represent a \nsolution for many of the mentioned problems. The ST features cover a wide range of services, like the reactive power \nsupport in MV grids, DC connectivity at both medium - and low-voltage level, and load control in LV side. The ST \nis designed following a three-stage solution, with the isolation stage in the DC/DC converter. This solution enables \nthe galvanic isolation between the two grids, guaranteeing the appliances safety during abnormal conditio ns (e.g., \nfaults or lightning strikes). The ST basic design does not differ substantially from the Solid State Transformer \nconcept. However, differently from the SST, designed mainly for traction applications or as mere 1-to1 replacement \nof conventional transformers, the ST shall be tailored to provide the previously mentioned services.  \nThis article present the grid-tailored design approach for smart transformers, taking in account the load requirements \n(e.g., unbalanced condi tions) and the services that can be provided to the grid (e.g., reactive power support). The \nproposed design approach shows how the ST can be undersized thanks to the higher control capability  on the low \nvoltage side or how the saving obtained due to such control actions on the low voltage side can be used  to provide \nmore services on the MV side. \n \nII. The Smart Transformer concept \nSeveral ST architectures have been proposed and classified in the literature.  An overview of the possible \narchitectures presenting several configurations has been presented in [4-7]. Among the possible configurations, the \nthree-stage one (composed by: MV stage / DC/DC stage / LV stage) enables dc-link connectivity and also guarantees \ninput/output decoupling of voltages and currents, providing the system control more degrees of freedom and making \nit the preferred candidate for an ST. To handle the MV level involved on the power conversion, modular architectures \nbring several advantages, such as low dv/dt (low electromagnetic interference emission), the potential to use standard \nLV-rating devices, and modularity, which allows for the implementation of redundant strategies  to increase fault \ntolerance and availability. For these reasons, modular architectures are preferable for ST applications.  \nFig. 1 shows the grid scenario in which the ST should operate, i.e. MV to LV connection with the availability of the \nDC Links preferably in both sides. \n \n \nFig. 1. The Smart Transformer (ST) and its role in the electric grid. \n \nA. LV side \nIn the LV grid , the ST controls the voltage waveform. Independently from the load current request, the ST \nprovides a sinusoidal voltage waveform with nominal amplitude and frequency. However, the ST can provide \nancillary services modifying the voltage amplitude and frequ ency. It is well known that the loads power \nconsumption depends on the voltage magnitude, as well as the grid -connected generators have frequency / \npower droop controllers to sustain the grid frequency during perturbations. The ST exploits these characteristic \nfor modifying the load consumption / generator production in LV grid. The possible ancillary services provided \nby these features are the load identification and control  [8], the soft load reduction [9], the reverse power flow \nlimitation [10, 11] and the ST overload control  [12]. In the first service, the sensitivities of active and reactive \npower to voltage and frequency variations are identified. These sensitivities are employed to increase the control \naccuracy: when the ST receives a power reduction request, the voltage controller reduces the voltage amplitude \nby the amount needed to achieve the desired power reduction. This service, called soft load reduction, allows \nparticipating to the transmission grid control, offering a power absorption control range of ±10%. This is shown \nin Fig. 2, where the LV side contro l modifies the voltage in order to re duce the consumption at LV side . An \nadditional 10% of control capability  is given by the possibility to modify the frequency, interacting with the \nrenewables. \n \n\n \nFig. 2 Services to the LV grid. a) block scheme of the LV side control, b) experimental setup based on Real \nTime Digital Simulator, c) soft-load reduction experiment [8], from top to bottom: sensitivity coefficients, \nvoltage profiles, power profile, percentage of shed load. \n \nTaking into account theses services, the most suitable topologies to implement the ST from the power \nelectronics viewpoint are: voltage source inve rter (VSI) four wires, based  on the Full-Bridge (FB), T -type or \nNeutral-Point-Clamped (NPC) topologies [4]. Due to the requirement of the neutral conductor, the middle point \ndc-link is available, leading to an additional voltage balancing circuit. The two -level FB topology represents  \nthe simplest approach and a consolidated solution. On the other hand, the three -level topologies have been \naccepted as feasible solutions by industry; for this reason, the NPC or T -Type topologies would allow the use \nof 600-V devices, improving the output waveform and system efficiency at the same time. \nB. DC/DC conversion \nThe availability of two DC stages allows for the creation of local or regional DC grids. The MV DC-link works \nas connection point between STs and can host new loads, like the fast charging -electric vehicles (FC -EV) \nstations and distributed resources, like large photovoltaic and wind power plants and battery energy storage \nsystems (BESS). The LV DC -link offers instead the possibility to connect the DC loads directly to a LV DC \ngrid, avoiding an intermediate conversion stage at the user’s site. The DC links allow for the AC power flow \nseparation between MV and LV grids. This feature enables controlling the two grids independently, with the \nonly constrain of the active power link.  \nThis power stage has strict requirements, such as high-rated power, high current capability on the LV side, and \nhigh-voltage capability, high frequency isolation, and high efficiency on the MV side. The basic configuration \nimplies series-connected modules in the MV side and parallel-connected ones in the LV side. \nThe basic module of the DC/DC stage is based on an isolated DC/DC converter, implemented normally using \nthe Dual Active Bridge (DAB)  converter [13], or the Series Resonant Converter (SRC) [14]. An additional \napproach is the use of multiwinding-based topologies, such as the quadruple active bridge (QAB) [15] as a basic \n\ncell. This converter presents the same advantages of the DAB converter, but with a lower  number of \nhigh/medium frequency transformers. Following the configuration in [15], the converter has a lower number of \nauxiliary components (e.g. drivers, auxiliary power supply) in the LV side. Regardless the basic power module, \nthe LV DC-link and/or MV DC-link are available for microgrids connection.  \nC. MV side \nAt the MV level, the ST controls the active current in order to keep the MV DC link voltage constant at the \nnominal value. The reactive power is controlled separately from the active power and represents a degree of \nfreedom for the system control. The ST can inject reactive power for voltage support purpose, both in steady -\nstate, controlling the voltage profile in the grid, and during transients, offering services like Low Voltage Ride \nThrough (LVRT). With the help of communication, the ST can perform the power factor correction at the \nHV/MV substation, reducing the reactive power request to the transmission grid. The active power is the only \nlink between the AC MV and LV smart transformer stages. Oscillating power components can be controlled \nseparately from the active power. Thus, harmonic voltage and current compensation is possible. \nThe most promising topologies to implement the MV stage of the ST are the Cascaded H -Bridge (CHB) \nconverter and Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC).  Both converters share the same features : modularity, \npossibility of fault-tolerance implementation, multilevel operation, reduced dv/dt and filter size. On hand, the \nMMC presents the additional advantage to provide the DC link for connection of MVDC loads/sources. On the \nother hand, this topology requires a very complex control system, bulky filter in the dc side (when compared to \nthe CHB topology) and high cost. For theses reason, it has not been adopted for MV applications yet, but only \nin HV applications.  \nThe CHB represents the most promising topology solution, thanks to its aforementioned advantages associated \nto a simple modulation and control system. Its main disadvantage , however, results to be  the lack of a MVDC \nlink for MVDC grids connectivity. \nThe NPC converter may be a possible topology to implement the MV stage and it represents a standard solution \nfor MV applications. However, due to the voltage level of the MVDC link (normally more than 15 kV), series \nconnection of IGBT is required. Furthermore, the NPC is not a modular solution and a bigger AC  filter, \ncompared to the previous converters, must be installed.   \nIII. SST Topology selected for the Smart Transformer \nTo select the proper architecture of the modular three -stage ST, not only the power converter must be chosen, \nbut also the number of modules plays an important role. In this section, these point s are discussed and the ST \narchitecture is selected , considering the grid specification presented in Table I.  Regarding the MV side \nconverter, the CHB topology is selected due to its simpler operation and control. In the LV side, a standard VSI \nis employed. \nThe DAB and the QAB converters are considered for the DC/DC stage because they offer power flow control . \nThe ST architectures employing DAB and QAB as a building block of the DC/DC are shown in Fig. 3. In these \nfigures, a unit is defined as a replaceable part of the ST and it is composed by the DC/DC converter associated \nto respective MV cell of the CHB connected to it, as can be seen in Fig. 3. \nTable I. Grid specification \nGrid Specification \nRated Power MVAC LVAC Grid frequency Total MVDC link LVDC link \n1 MVA 10 kV 400 V 50 Hz 700 V 700 V \n \nA. Number of Unit Selection \nTo select the number of modules, the constraints are: fault tolerance capability, IGBT blocking voltage, system \ncomplexity, number of components and  rated power of the modules. All these parameters have influence on \ncost, reliability, efficiency and system complexity. The number of units is selected from the MV side viewpoint, \ntaking the cost as the main parameter.  \nIf a large number of modules is selected, the semiconductor blocking voltage of the MV side is reduced, but the \ntotal amount of parts (including auxiliary power supply, drivers, communication, etc.) and system complexity \nincrease considerably. Table II shows the main parameters of the ST MV side for different numbers of units, \nconsidering both DAB and QAB solutions. In this analysis, the available IGBT modules on the market from the \nmain manufactures were considered and they are listed in Table VII of the A ppendix A. For the cost analysis, \nIGBT modules from Powerex/Mitsubishi a re assumed, as presented in Table VIII (Appendix A). As can be \nnoticed in Table II , the MV side current is independent from the number of units, because the modules  share \nthe voltage and power among them in the MV side.  Thus, the use of high voltage blocking IGBT s implies an \nunderutilization of the devices, because they are normally  available only for high current. Furthermore, the \ndevice cost is very high, leading to the most expensive solution, as presented in Table II. From the cost analysis, \nthe most advantageous solutio n is employing 27 or 36 CHB cells (with a difference of only U$ 720  between \nthem). Considering also the implementation complexity and the number of components, 27 CHB cells represent \nto be most suitable solution and this design is considered for this work. \n \nTable II.

QAB and DAB Converter Comparison \nSince the DAB and QAB converters are the most promising topologies, they are compared in this work in terms \nof cost, efficiency, complexity and reliability. Both converters are designed assuming the specifications and \nparameters presented in Tables I and II.  A phase-shift modulation is considered [15], with a nominal phase \nangle of 35º and switching frequency of fs = 20 kHz. The detailed values obtained from the design are presented \nin Appendix B. A comparative analysis of both converters is presented in Table III, where the main parameters \nof the design are summarized and the components quantity and cost are presented.  \nThe QAB conver ter has  less LV cells, as well as fewer  transformers. Consequently, the employed \nsemiconductors and auxiliary components, such as gate-driver units (GDU), auxiliary power supplies (APS) \nand control and communication system s are also reduced, compared to the DAB solution. Although higher \ncurrent rating devices are required to implement  the LV cell of the QAB  (see table III), the individual device \ncost does not differ much fr om the cost of the devices required by the DAB solution, as can be seen in Table \nVII. Consequently, the QAB converter presents as the most effective solution economically and practically, \n\nsince it uses fewer components . By using QAB instead DAB, a cost sav ing of U$ 2350.08 (only in \nsemiconductors) is achieved and this value can be higher if the auxiliary components are considered. Fig. 4 \nshows a qualitative comparison between the QAB and DAB converters. In balanced condition, both converters \npresent the same performance f rom the efficiency viewpoint [15]. On the other hand , the control of the QAB \npresents higher complexity than the DAB one. Despite this fact, the QAB solution presents several advantages \nover the DAB solution, and then it is chosen to implement the DC/DC of the ST.   \nTable III.

Proposed grid tailored approach \nThe ST design is a complex matter: the peak load consumption is difficult to be evaluated, and it is limited in the \ntime to few hours for year. The actual procedure for sizing the conventional transformer is quite conservative, and \nit is based on the peak load. As high lighted in [16], this results in a transformer oversizing in the majority of the \ncases (63% in the study carried). Only few transformers have been adequately sized or undersized.  \nThe classical SST design is based on equally sized converters and it comes from the conventional transformer sizing. \nAs base case, the SST has been sized fo r 1 MVA power. The ST enables an improved load control, mainly in LV \nside. Modifying the voltage amplitude and frequency, the ST can interact with the LV generators and loads in order \nto modify the power consumption [9]. The possibility to reduce the active power consumption acting on the voltage \nis well known in North America, where the Conservation Voltage Reduction (CVR) is widely applied [17, 18]. The \nCVR expl oits the transformer on-Line Tap Changers ( LTC) to decrease the voltage in the downstream grid. \nReducing the voltage, also the grid power consumption decreases. In [ 15] the energy saved along the year is \nestimated to be 4%, and the load peak reduction up to 4%. However, the CVR cannot  evaluate on line the power \nreduction. The ST, implementing the On -Line Load Identification [8], is able to identify the load sensitivity to \nvoltage and frequency variation, and thus to apply a more accurate control action, as shown in [9]. From the surveys’ \nresult in [19], the distribution system operators identify the load response to voltage variations as constant current \nload for the active power, and as constant impedance load for the reactive power. Considering the ST cap ability to \nreduce the voltage up to 10%, the amount of power reduced for a residential grid can be estimated in 10% active \npower and up to 20% of reactive power. Considering a power factor of 0.9 pu, the total apparent power that can be \ncontrolled results be 20%. \nThe power generation in the LV grid is independent from the voltage amplitude. The voltage control performed by \nthe ST cannot modify the generators power injection, being not sensitive to voltage variations. However, controlling \nthe frequency, the ST can interact with the droop controller of the distributed generators in LV grid and modify their \npower injection [10, 12]. While a power reduction is technically feasible [10], increasing the power of the generators \ndepends on the availability of controlled resources in the LV grid. The renewables do not have usually reserve energy \nto be employed in this case, and thus appliances like microturbines, diesel generators or storage systems are needed \nfor providing upwards regulation capability to the ST. The current LV grid takes the direction of implementing more \ncontrollable gen eration and load in the “Smart Grid” vision [20]. Although in few years the grid will be fully \ncontrollable, it can be assumed that the controllable generation installed in LV grid can cover up to 10% of the load \nconsumption. \n\nConsidering the ST features, a  total apparent power controllability of 20% is estimated. Thus, the ST size can be \ndecreased by 20% with respect to the conventional transformer design. In this context, an inno vative ST design \napproach named  “Grid-Tailored-Design-Approach” (GTDA) is proposed. Applying the GTDA, the power \nconverters of the ST are used in more efficient way, resulting in cost and footprint reduction. On one hand, if more \ngrid services are desired, a power converter stage may presents higher cost, depending on the service.  On the other \nhand, the saving in one or more stages can be used to compensate for the extra cost of the other stage (due to the \nadditional service), keeping the total cost comparable to the one from the convention design.  The GTDA has the \nadvantage of providing more services at the same cost of the SST or conventional transformer design.  \nAs an example, the MV converter can be sized following two strategies: the minimum cost or the inclusion of more \ngrid ancillary services. The minimum cost strategy designs the MV side depending on the DC/DC converter size, \nminimizing the hardware expenses. The second strategy, instead, is based on sizing the MV converter in order to \nprovide services to the MV grid, such as reactive power support. In this case, the cost saving from the LV side and \nDC/DC stages can be invested on the MV side stage, leading to a constant cost with the additional service of reactive \npower support. The Table IV shows the power level required for each ST stage, considering the different design \napproach. In this Table, the case A is the standard design approach, where each stage is designed for the same power, \ndefined by the load. In case B, the load reduction ser vice is applied in the LV, leading to a power reduction and \nconsequently to the cost minimization. In that case, all stages are designed for the same power level. In case C, the \nGTDA is considered, and the cost saved in the LV and DC/DC stages is invested in the MV side, to provide more \nreactive power to support the MV grid. These  values are obtained based on the detail ed design of the converters, \nincluding the calculation of the cost, as discussed in the next section.  \nTable IV.

GTDA design procedure \nIn order to design a ST using the GTDA, the topology shown in Fig. 3 (a), as well as the specification presented in \nTable I, are used. The ST is designed considering the three cases presented in Table IV. \nFor each converter, the sizing is based on the semiconductor selection, cooling system and capacitor bank. These \ncomponents are designed following the equations (1) to (4).  \nA. Design Considerations \n Semiconductors Design \nThe semiconductors are selected considering the maximum blocking voltage and the average current flowing \nthrough them. For each case shown in Table IV, the power processed by the converter is affected, but the voltage \nlevels are constant. The selection is made on the average current and the power dissipated in each device (1). \nFor the power semiconductors selection, the available IGBT power module s from Infineon Technology (with \nDual configuration) is considered in the DC/DC and LV stages. For the MV stage, IGBT power modules from \nInfineon Technology and Fuji Electric are assumed. For price comparison purposes, the quotation is obtained \nfrom the same distributor (Mouser Electronics) and for the same amount of pieces (40 pieces). \n \n Cooling System Design \nTo design the cooling system of the power converter, the conventional approach based on the semiconductors \npower dissipation (P), ambient temperature (Tamb), junction temperature (TJ) and thermal resistance in the power \npath between the junction and the ambient (Rth) is considered [21]. To evaluate the influence of the services on \nthe cooling system, the “cooling system performance index” (CSPI) approach [21] is used. Using this approach, \na constant cooling profile is selected, leading to a constant CSPI, as defined in (3). The volume of the heatsink \nis proportional to the power dissipation, as described in (4).  To compute the cost of the cooling system, it is \nassumed that the price of the heatsink is proportional to the volume. A constan t CSPI is considered to keep the \njunction temperature at 100ºC for the device with lower losses, i.e. lower cooling system requirement. For the \ndevices that dissipate more power, parallel heatsink blocks are considered.  \n \n Capacitor Bank Design \nThe required capacitance is calculated according to the power processed by the converter [22], using (2)  in \nTable III. As it can be seen, the required capacitance is directly related with the apparent power processed, for \na giving voltage ripple (∆VMVDC), and therefore it is directly influenced by the additional grid services. For the \ncost comparison, a basic capacitor block of 100 µF / 500 V  is assumed , to be assembled in series/parallel \naccording to the converter requirements.  \nThe design solution for the LV side capacitor is based on setting the maximum voltage oscillation (i.e., 5%), \nemploying equation (5). The capacitance is calculated taking in account the DC link nominal voltage and the \npossible current imbalance that can happen in the grid. This v alue can be obtained from historical data of the \nLV grid and knowing in advance of the presence of fixed three -phase loads (balanced by nature ). If the peak-\nto-peak power oscillation is 300 kW and the system is working at nominal DC voltage of 700 V, a capacitance \nat least of 18mF is suggested. \nAdditionally, for the DC/DC stage, the transformer design is considered. For the three different cases, the same \ntransformer core with different litz wires is assumed. Thus, for the cost comparison of the transformer, only the \niron amount is considered. The cost of the magnetics is evaluated by employing textbook formulas [23] : from \nthe effective current, the wire area and the number of turns is evaluated. As design parameters, switching \nfrequency, peak flux and current density are considered constant, as well as the core size. From the copper \nvolume, it is possible to calculate the estimated costs [24]. From these assumption, the volume of the copper is \nproportional to the processed power. Since the design is performed with the same DC voltage, the price of the \ncopper is proportional to the effective current.  For the cases B and C, less iron is u sed on the transformer, \nleading to the cost reduction. The wires are selected according to the effective current as presented in [15]. More \ndetail on the design of this stage in presented in [15].  \n \nTable V .

Design Results Discussion \nAs a result of the design, the normalized required semiconductor, cooling system volume and capacitance for \neach design case are presented in Fig. 5 , for each stage of the ST. In order to compare the influence of the \nsemiconductors selection on the ST design, two semiconductors modules from differ ent manufactures were \nassumed for the MV side , due to their high performance:  FF150R17KE4  (1.7 kV/150A from Infineon \nTechnology) and 2MBI75VA-170-50  (1.7 kV/75A from Fuji Electric). As can be noticed, the current rating of \nthe Infineon Power Modules is twice the one from the Fuji Electric, implying in an underutilization of the first \none. Nevertheless, using the power module from Infineon, the current flowing through the channel is  much \nsmaller than the semiconductors current rating, leading to an operation point with small forward drop voltage \n(VCE(on)). Consequently, the power dissipation is small, as well as the cooling system volume , as depicted in \nFig. 5 (a). Note that the power semiconductor selection plays an important role in the ST design, affecting cost, \nefficiency and volume. Apart from its own cost, the semiconductor selection influences the cooling system cost \nand volume. Hence, the trade-off between these components must be considered. In this study, it is assumed a \nheatsink building block with a cost of U$ 50. These blocks are parallelized if more cooling capability is required.  \nFor this particular case, an overall cost comparison of the MV stage considering those two different \nsemiconductors is shown in Fig. 7 . In spite of the high cooling system required by the Fuji Electric power \nmodules (see. Fig. 5 (a)), the semiconductors price is considerably lower, compensating for the high investment \nin the cooling system. Therefore, the MV stage design using Fuji Electric is more viable economically.  \nDue to the higher power level in Case C, the semiconductor is better used than in case A and B. On the other \nhand, the amount of cooling system is much higher, since the power dis sipation is also higher. For the LV side \nand DC/DC stages, the design for the cases B and C are the same, since the amount of processed power and \nvoltage remains the same.  \nAs already mentioned, in case C, the saving cost from the LV side and DC/DC is invested on the MV stage. \nConsidering the results obtained and presented in Fig. 5 , the saving cost is shared among the cooling system \nand capacitors, once the semiconductors of  the MV remained the same. For this reason, a reduction of 20% of \npower in the LV and DC/DC stages allows to increase the power of the MVA of around 100% with respect to \ncase A. Thus, for the assumed parameters, the MV stage can provide 2 MVA of apparent p ower, keeping the \nsame overall system cost of case A. This is exemplified with the graphic of Fig. 6. \n \n \nFig 5. Design of the ST for the three different cases: (a) MV stage; (b) DC-DC stage and (c) LV stage. \n \nFig. 6. The block diagram of the ST considering the three different design approaches, highlighting the power \nprocessed by each stage: (a) Case A: Standard design approach; (b) Case B: Standard Design, including the \nLV services to reduce the load consumption; (c) Case C: proposed Grid Tailored Desi gn Approach (GTDA). \n\n \nFig 7. Cost comparison of the MV stage for different semiconductors power modules.  \n \nVI. Simulation case study of the proposed GTDA \nDepending on the grid needs, the ST can provide different services: local voltage support, voltage control in a \nspecific bus, and power factor control at the HV/MV substation busbar. The simplest service it can provide is the \noperation under unity power factor. The LV side converter produces the reactive power for the LV grid, and the MV \nconverter can absorb only active power, reducing the reactive power burden of the MV grid. The ST injects reactive \npower to control the voltage at its busbar, or at a speci fic busbar in the grid. In a specific case, it can control the \npower factor at the HV/MV substation busbar, avoiding low power factor conditions (i.e., below 0.9 p.u.).  \nHowever, the reactive power injection depends on the MV converter size and the active p ower request in LV side \n(both AC and DC). The LV active power can be only partially regulated [6], but it affects the power quality in the \ngrid. Instead, the size of the MV side converter can be tailored to the MV grid to have better control margins.  \nIn Fig.8 is shown a practical example of what described above. A load flow simulation has been performed on a \nmodified IEEE 34-bus test feeder. The grid voltage adopted is 10 kV , in order to match with the ST considered in \nthis work. The ST absorbs 700 kW of active power and the LV loads work with a power factor  of 0.9 pu. The ST \ninjects reactive power to  its maximum capability  to support the voltage profile. If the ST is sized following the \nconventional transformer or SST design strategy (Case A), the amount of reactive power injected is limited to 714 \nkVAR, not sufficient to keep the voltage at about 0.95 pu. For the Case B, the power processed by the ST is lower \nthan the Case A applications. Thus, the amount of reactive power injected in MV grid i s lower, and no voltage \nsupport can be given (green line in Fig. 8). With the proposed design approach in Case C, the ST can be undersized \nin the LV and DC/DC stages, and the MV converter can be increased up to 2 MVA, without increasing the \ntransformer costs. However, the benefits for the MV grid are clear. With higher reactive power capability, the ST is \nable to sustain the voltage profile above 0.95 pu in the whole grid, guaranteeing a good quality of the service.  \n \nFig. 8. Voltage profile in the modified IEEE-34 bus feeder in the design case A (point-dot black line), in the design \nCase B (continuous green line) and in the design case C (dotted blue line). The minimum voltage limits are marked \n(continuous red line, 0.95 pu). \n \nVII. Experimental Results of the ST \n\nIn order to evaluate experimentally the operation of the ST, a downscaled prototype has been developed and tested. \nTable VI presents the specifications of the prototype, and Fig. 9 shows the prototype and the topology. In the MV \nside, the cells of the CHB and QAB are assembled together and share the cooling system. A peak efficiency of  \n94.5% was obtained with IGBT IHW40N120. To reduce the switching and conduction losses, SiC MOSFETs could \nbe used, allowing for an increase of efficiency up to 97.5% (with C2M0025120D devices).  \nTable VI.

Conclusions and future research topics \nIn this paper, the design of a three -stage Smart Transformer is analyzed. The standard design flow for this system \nimplies sizing each stage for the peak load request from the LV side. By exploiting the control functionality of the \nST, however, a controllability margin exists to re-shape the load profile, effectively decreasing the power handling \nrequirements from the LV and DC/DC stages. This feature is exploited by a Grid-Tailored-Design-Approach, where \nthe cost saved in in the LV and DC/DC stage is re -invested in the MV stage, to make it able to process a greater \namount of reactive power to guarantee MV voltage support. It is shown that the GTDA allows obtaining a ST design \nthat can supply the same grid of an SST, but providing grid voltage support in the MV side at the same cost. \nIX.
