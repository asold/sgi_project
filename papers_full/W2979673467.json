INTRODUCTION \ns one of  the fundamental mathematical operation s in \nmodern signal processing, the Hilbert transform has found \nwide applications in radar systems, signal sideband modulators, \nmeasurement systems, speech processing, signal sampling, and \nmany others [1]. While standard Hilbert transforms perform a  \n± 90° phase shift around a central frequency, with an all -pass \namplitude transmission, fractional Hilbert transform s (FHTs) \n                                                           \nThis work was supported by the Australian Research Council Discovery \nProjects Program (No. DP150104327).

They were introduced to realize versatile processing \nfunctions in order to meet specific requirements for practical \napplications such as hardware keys [2, 3], and they also play an \nimportant role in secure single sideband communications [2]. \nThey also find applications in forming an image that is edge \nenhanced relative to the input object - the FHT was introduced \nto be able to select which edges are enhanced and to what \ndegree the edge enhancement occurs [4]. \nFractional Hilbert transformer s based on electronics are \nsubject to the intrinsic electronic bandwidth bottleneck [2, 5], \nthus significantly limiting their processing speed. In contrast,  \nphotonic technologies offer broad operation bandwidths as well \nas strong immunity to electromagnetic interference and thus are \nattractive for implementing high-speed fractional Hilbert \ntransformers. Hilbert transformers based on free- space optics \nhave been demonstrated [3, 6], which, although achieving \nattractive performance, are often bulky and suffer from  \nsignificant complexity. Hilbert transformers based on  phase-\nshifted fibre Bragg gratings can achieve  broad operation \nbandwidths up to a few hundred  gigahertz [ 7-10]. However, \nthese methods can only yield precise FHTs for signals with \nspecific bandwidths , for fixed fractional order s, and only \nproduce the FHT of complex optical fields. This holds true for \nrecent reports of an integrated reconfigurable microwave \nprocessor [11] as well as a a simple, wideband and direct route \nto realize continuously tunable FHT based on a Bragg grating \n[12]. In practice, however, the FHT of the temporal intensity \nprofiles associated with radio frequency ( RF) and microwave \nsignals, and not the complex optical fields, is required in many \napplications such as ultra -wideband frequency generation, RF \nmeasurement, and RF signal reshaping [13-16].  \nA.

Nguyen, Sai T. Chu, \nBrent E. Little, Roberto Morandotti, Arnan Mitchell, and David J. Moss \nA \n \n2 \n \n2 \nIn recent y ears, integrated fractional Hilbert transformers \nbased on microring/microdisk resonators and Bragg gratings on \na silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform have been demonstrated , \nas well as in integrated InP-InGaAsP photonic chips, which can \nall provide competitive advantages such as compact device \nfootprint, high stability, and mass-producibility [11,12, 17-19]. \nBetter tunability has also been achieved by introducing thermo-\noptic microheaters to tune the phase shift . Nevertheless, these \nintegrated devices can still on ly perform FHT s for complex \noptical fields and in most cases only provide a limited tuning \nrange in the fractional order phase shift . In order to perform \nFHTs for the temporal intensity profiles of RF signals,  other \napproaches based on transversal filter structures have been \nproposed, which can offer high reconfigurability by adjusting \nthe tap coefficient s, thus allow ing precise con trol of the \nfractional order in a broad tuning range [20, 21]. One drawback \nto this approach, h owever, is that photonic transv ersal filters \ntypically rely on multiple discrete laser  sources that result in \nsignificantly increased system size, cost, and complexity, which \nlimits the number of available taps and result s in degraded \nprocessing performance. Therefore, instead of using individual \nlight sources  for each tap, a single source that can \nsimultaneously generate a large number of  high-quality \nwavelength channels would be highly desirable. \nOptical frequency comb (OFC) technology has provided a \npowerful solution to  address this issue and ha s attracted \nsignificant interests in recent years  [22-36]. Various types of \nOFCs generated by mode -locked laser s [37], electro -optical \nmodulators [38], and optical micro-resonators [39] have been \ndemonstrated. Among them, Kerr OFCs  generated by micro-\nresonators, or micro-combs, particularly those based on CMOS-\ncompatible integrated platforms, can provide a large number of \nwavelength channels with greatly reduced footprint and \ncomplexity [40- 49].  \nRecently, [49] we demonstrated a photonic Hilbert \ntransformer with up to 20 taps, based on a 200GHz spaced \nmicro-comb source that achieved record performance in terms \nof RF bandwidth (5 octaves). Here, we demonstrate a fractional \nHilbert transformer based on a Kerr micro-comb source with a \nsignificantly finer 50GHz comb spacing that provides a much \nlarger number of c omb lines (80) that serve s as a high -\nperformance multi -wavelength source for the photonic RF \ntransversal filter. By programming and shaping the comb lines \naccording to  judiciously calculated tap weights, we \nexperimentally demonstrate a FHT with arbitrary fractional \norders and very broad operation bandwidth s. We characterize \nthe RF amplitude and phase response of the fractional Hilbert \ntransformer with variable phase shifts of 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, \nand 90° that correspond to tunable fractional orders of 0.17, \n0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83, and 1, respectively. We achieve operation \nover more than 5 octaves from 480MHz to 16.45GHz for t he \n90° phase-shift FHT and ±0.07 rad phase variation within the \n3-dB bandwidth. System demonstrations of a real-time FHT for \nGaussian pulse input signals are also performed. For the 0.166, \n0.333, 0.5, 0.667, 0.833, and 1 fractional order Hilbert \ntransformers, with root-mean-square errors (RMSEs ) between \nthe measured and theoretical curves being ~2.73%,  ~2.75%,  \n~2.69%,  ~2.69%,  ~2.92%,  ~2.85%,  respectively. Th is good \nagreement with theory confirm s our approach as a n effective \nway to implement high-speed reconfigurable fractional Hilbert \ntransformers with reduced footprint, lower complexity, and \npotentially lower cost.  \nII. PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION \nThe spectral transfer function of a fractional Hilbert transformer \ncan be expressed as [3, 50]: \n𝐻𝐻𝑃𝑃(𝜔𝜔) = �𝑒𝑒−𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗, 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 0 ≤ 𝜔𝜔 < 𝜋𝜋\n𝑒𝑒𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗, 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 −𝜋𝜋 ≤ 𝜔𝜔 < 0  (1) \nwhere φ = P × π / 2 is the phase shift, with  𝑃𝑃 denoting the \nfractional order. As can be seen from Eq. (1), a fractional \nHilbert transformer can be regarded as a phase shifter with ± φ \nphase shifts around the centre frequency ω  and it becomes a \nclassical Hilbert transformer when  P = 1. The corresponding \nimpulse response is a continuous hyperbolic function given by \n[49, 50]: \n ℎ𝑃𝑃(𝑡𝑡) = �\n1\n𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋 , 𝑡𝑡 ≠ 0\ncot(𝜑𝜑) , 𝑡𝑡 = 0\n  (2) \nThe hyperbolic function is truncated and sampled in time by \ndiscrete taps. The sample spacing Δ t determines the null \nfrequency fc = 1/Δt . The order of the fractional Hilbert \ntransformer is continuously tunable by only adjust ing the \ncoefficient of the 9 th (t = 0)  tap while keeping the same \ncoefficients for the other taps [3]. The theoretical amplitude and \nphase response of a fractional Hilbert transformer with 15°, 30°, \n45°, 60°, 75°, and 90° phase shifts are shown in Figs. 1 (a)-(f) \nsolid black curves. The corresponding fractional orders  are \n0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83, and 1, respectively.   \nTo implement the fractional Hilbert transformer, w e \nuse a transversal filter approach that offers  high performance \nand reconfigurability in terms of filtering shapes  [51-59]. In a \ntransversal filter , discrete frequency samples of the optical \nsignal containing the RF modulation are time delayed, weighted, \nsummed together, and finally detected by a photodetector to \ngenerate the RF output. This is essentially equivalent to the \nfilters in digital signal processing (DSP), but implemented by \nphotonic hardware.  The transfer function of a photonic \ntransversal filter is given by: \n \n 𝐻𝐻(𝜔𝜔) = ∑ ℎ(𝑛𝑛)𝑒𝑒\n−𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑁𝑁−1\n𝑗𝑗=0   (3) \n \nwhere ω is the angular frequency of the input RF signal which \nalso c orresponds to the RF frequency of the vector network \nanalyser (VNA), the number of taps (n) corresponds to  the \nnumber of lines from the Kerr comb, h(n) is the discrete impulse \nresponse representing the tap coefficient of the nth taps, N is the \nnumber of taps, T is the time delay between adjacent taps , and \nthe free spectral range  in the RF  (FSRRF) of the transversal \nfilter is FSRRF = 1/ T. A f ractional Hilbert transformer with \narbitrary fractional order can be realized by properly setting the \ntap coefficients, i.e., h(n), n = 0, 1, …, N-1. The corresponding \namplitude response of the fractional Hilbert transformers with  \n15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, and 90° phase shifts as functions of the \n \n3 \n \n3 \nnumber of taps are shown in Figs. 1 (a) -(f). As the number of \ntaps increases, the discrepancy between t he ideal amplitude \nresponse of the fractional Hilbert transversal filters and that of \nthe transversal filter decreases for all six fractional orders. To \nquantify these discrepancies, we show  the RMSEs in Fig. 2 , \nwhere we see that they are inversely proportional to the number \nof taps, as expected. In particular, we note that when the number \nof taps increases, the RMSE decreases dramatically for small \nnumbers of taps and then decreases more gradually  as the \nnumber of taps becomes larger.  \nIII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP \nFigure 3 shows a schematic diagram of the f ractional Hilbert \ntransformer. It consists of two main modules: (i) the micro -\ncomb generation module based on a nonlinear micro- ring \nresonator (MRR), and (ii) a transversal filter module for the \nreconfigurable FHT with tunable fractional order.  \n    In the first module, optical microcombs were generated in an \nintegrated MRR fabricated on a high -index doped silica  glass \nplatform using CMOS-compatible fabrication process [30-36]. \nFirst, high-index (n=~1.7 at 1550 nm) doped silica glass films \nwere deposi ted using plasma enhanced chemical vapour \ndeposition, then patterned by deep ultraviolet photolithography \nand processed via reactive ion etching to form waveguides with \nexceptionally low surface roughness. Finally, silica (n  = ~1.44 \nat 1550 nm) was deposit ed as an upper cladding. The \nadvantages of our platform for optical micro- comb generation \ninclude ultra -low linear loss (~0.06 dB·cm -1), a moderate \nnonlinear parameter (~233 W -1·km-1), and in particular a \nnegligible nonlinear loss up to extremely high inte nsities (~25 \nGW·cm-2). Due to the ultra-low loss of our platform, the MRR \nfeatures narrow resonance linewidths of 130MHz FWHM [60, \n61], corresponding to a quality factor of ~1.5 million. After \npackaging the device with fiber pigtails, the through- port \ninsertion loss was ~1 dB, assisted by on-chip mode converters. \nThe radius of the MRR was ~592 μm, corresponding to an \noptical free spectr al range of ~0.4 nm  or 50GHz . To obtain \noptimal parametric gain, the MRR was designed to feature \nanomalous dispersion in the C-band. A continuous-wave pump \nat a wavelength of λ=1550.500 nm was amplified by an erbium-\ndoped fibre amplifier and the polarizati on was adjusted via a \npolarization controller to optimize the power coupled in to the \nMRR. When the pump wavelength was swept across one of the \nMRR’s resonances with the pump power high enough to \nprovide sufficient parametric gain, optical parametric \noscillation occurred, ultimately generating Kerr optical combs \nwith a spacing equal to the free spectral range of the MRR  \n(Figure 4(c)). Soliton crystal combs with distinctive ‘fingerprint’ \noptical spectra were observed , which arose from spectral \ninterference between tightly pac kaged solitons in the cavity \n[29]. We note that the soliton crystal micro -combs were \ngenerated through adiabatic  pump wavelength sweeping – \neasily achievable via manual tuning.  \nIn the second module, the generated soliton crystal comb was \nspectrally shaped via two -stage optical shapers (Finisar, \nWaveShaper 4000S) to enable a larger dynamic range of loss \ncontrol as well as a higher shaping accuracy (brought about by \nthe intrinsic properties of the WaveShaper). The micro -comb \nwas first shaped to reduce the initial power difference between \nthe comb lines  to < 5 dB. In these experiments we used a \nmaximum of 17 taps, or wavelengths, from the micro- comb. \nThe space between the 8th and 9th taps and 9th and 10th taps \nwas 0.8 nm, corresponding to ∆λ = 0.4 × 2 = 0.8 nm, while the \nspacing between the remaining taps was twice this, at 1.6 nm. \nThis was done in order to increase the Nyquist zone of ~ 50GHz. \nNext, the shaped comb lines were fed into an electro -optical \nintensity modulator and then transmitt ed through a spool of \nstandard single mode fibre (length: L=2.1 km, dispersion: β = \n~17.4 ps / nm / km) to provide a wavelength dependent time \ndelay τ = L × β × ∆λ = ~29.4 ps, corresponding to an  FSR\nRF of \n1/2τ = ~17GHz. The operational bandwidth of the fractional \nHilbert transformer was mainly determined by the FSR RF. An \nincreased operation bandwidth can be obtained by employing a \ndispersive fibre with a shorter length.  \n The shaped comb lines were then amplified and accurately \nshaped by a second WaveShaper according to the designed tap \ncoefficients. A feedback control path was adopted to increase \nthe accuracy of the comb shaping for the second WaveShaper, \nwhere the powers of the comb lines from another output port of \nthe WaveShaper were detected by an optical spectrum analyzer \nand compared with the ideal tap weights to generate feedback \nerror signals for calibration. Finally, the weighted  comb lines \nrepresenting positive and negative taps were separated by  the \nWaveShaper and converted into electronic signals by  a \nbalanced photodetector.  \n \nTABLE I \nPERFORMANCE OF THE FRACTIONAL HILBERT TRANSFORMER \nOrder Phase shift Lower cutoff frequency Upper cutoff frequency Octaves Passband ripple Temporal pulse RMSE \n0.166 15° < 10 MHz * 17.1 GHz >10 * <0.9 dB 2.73% \n0.333 30° < 10 MHz * 17.1 GHz >10 * <1.1 dB 2.75% \n0.5 45° 0.035 GHz 16.67 GHz > 8 <1.7 dB 2.69% \n0.667 60° 0.49 GHz 16.6 GHz > 5 <2.3 dB 2.69% \n0.833 75° 0.48 GHz 16.5 GHz > 5 <2.9 dB 2.92% \n1 90° 0.48 GHz 16.45 GHz > 5 <2.9 dB 2.85% \n* the theoretical lower limit is zero (DC). The 10MHz listed here is not fundamental but arises from the lower frequency limit of t he vector \nnetwork analyzer \n \n4 \n \n4 \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nThe system RF frequency response was characterized using \na vector network analyser (VNA, Agilent MS4644B) to \nmeasure the system RF amplitude and phase frequency \nresponse. First, the VNA was calibrated using the 9th (t = 0) tap \nbefore the measurement and th en the signal output RF SIG was \nmeasured with the calibrated VNA.  \nFigure 5(a) and (b) show the experimental measurements of \nthe RF amplitude frequency response and phase response of the \nfractional Hilbert transformer with a 45-degree phase shift for \n5, 9, 13 and 17 taps, respectively. As predicted in Fig. 5 (a), the \noperation bandwidth increases with the number of taps. Since \nour device was designed to perform a fractional Hilbert \ntransform for base -band RF signals, the operatin g frequency \nrange started at 0.48GHz and ended at 16.45GHz. With 17 tap \nfilters, the fractional Hilbert transformer exhibited a 3-dB \nbandwidth extending from 0.48GHz to 16.45GHz, \ncorresponding to more than 5 octaves, with a phase variation of \nabout ±0.07 rad over the 3-dB pass-band. It is possible to further \nincrease this bandwidth further by using more comb lines in the \nfilter, although in these experiments, only the central part of the  \nC band was actually used to realize the filter taps, limited by the \ncapability of the WaveShaper to compensate for second -order \ndispersion. For a Hilbert transformer with a 90° phase shift, we \nwere able to use more than 40 taps, thereby reducing the RMSE \nand amplitude ripple within the pass-band [51]. As seen in Fig. \n5 (c), the theoretical 3-dB bandwidth increases rapidly with the \nnumber of taps up to 17 taps, after which it levels off , so that \nthe benefit of increasing the number of taps is somehow limited \nin other words, 17 is close to the optimum number of taps.   \nWe also performed system demonstrations of real -time \nsignal fractional Hilbert transform s for Gaussian -like input \npulses with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of  ~200 ps, \ngenerated by an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG, \nKEYSIGHT M9505A), as shown in Fig. 6.    \nSince the spectrum of the comb generated by the MRR did \nnot follow the require ments needed to produce the impulse \nresponse of a fractional Hilbert transformer, it was necessary to \nshape the comb in order to achieve the designed positive and \nnegative tap coefficients. The  optical spectra in Fig. 7 (i) was \nmeasured by an  optical spectrum analyzer (OSA, with a \nresolution of 0.5 nm). A good match between the power of the \nmeasured comb lines (red solid lines for the negative tap \ncoefficients and blue lines for the positive tap coefficients) and \nthe calculated ideal taps weights ( orange dots for the negative \ntap coefficients and green dots for the positive tap coefficients) \nwas obtained, indicating that the comb lines were accurately  \nshaped. We note that the spikes observable in Fig.6 in both the \nexperimentally measured and simulated FFT results are real and \nare a result of the AWG. However, while the AWG did \nintroduce some glitches, overall the signal was very pure and \nthe spikes contained very little e nergy; hence, they did not \nsignificantly affect the measurements. \nFigures 7 (ii)-(iii) present the simulated (red dashed curves) \nand measured (blue solid lines) transmission response \nmagnitude and phase. The normalized frequency and phase \nresponse of the f ractional Hilbert transformer with tunable \norders of 0.166, 0.333, 0.5, 0.667, 0.833, 1, corresponding to \nphase shifts of 15°,  30°,   45°,   60°,   75°,   90° are shown.  The \nimbalance of the S21 response around the null frequencies is \ndue to high order dispersion and modulator chirp causing \nvariation in the spacing between taps  [49]. The amplitude \nvariations are < 3dB between 480MHz and 16.45GHz and the \nphase variations are about ±0.07 rad within the 3-dB passband.   \nFig. 7 (iv) shows the pulse d waveform after processing by \nthe fractional Hilbert transformer . The detailed performance \nparameters are listed in Table 1. The output waveform was \nobserved by means of a high- speed real -time oscilloscope \n(KEYSIGHT DSOZ504A Infinium). For comparison, we show \nthe simulated results (Fig. 7 (iv), red dashed curves). For the \n0.166, 0.333, 0.5, 0.667, 0.833, and 1 fractional order Hilbert \ntransformers, the calculated RMSEs between the measured and \nthe theoretical curves are ~2.73%,  ~2.75%,  ~2.69%,  ~2.69%,  \n~2.92%,  ~2.85%,  respectively. As can be seen, the measured \ncurves closely match the theoretical counterparts, achieving \ngood performance that agrees well with theory.  \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn summary, we propose and demonstrate a continuously  \ntunable (in its order) microwave and RF  fractional Hilbert \ntransformer based on an integrated Kerr micro-comb source. \nThe microcomb produced a large number of comb lines via a \nCMOS-compatible nonlinear MRR that greatly increases the \nprocessing bandwidth. By programming and shaping the comb \nlines according to the calculated tap weights, we successfully \ndemonstrate a fractional Hilbert  transformer with tunable \nfractional orders of 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83 , and 1. We \ncharacterize the RF amplitude and phase response ,  obtaining \nan operation bandwidth of  ~16 GHz. We perform  system \ndemonstrations of the real-time FHT for Gaussian pulse input \nsignals, obtaining good agreement with theory and verifying \nthat this approach is an effective way to implement high-speed \nreconfigurable fractional Hilbert transformer s featuring high \nprocessing bandwidths and reconfigurability, for future ultra -\nhigh-speed microwave systems.  \nREFERENCES \n[1] S.
