Artiﬁcial intelligence is the\ndiscipline of computer science aiming to build intelligent entities. It was initiated in the\n1950s, contemporaneously with the development of computer science (2).

Deep learning (DL) has been\ndeveloped recently as a set of methods based on artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks (ANN), a category of ML algorithms. DL organizes ANNs\nin multiple connected layers, which are able to learn andﬁnalize\ndecisions independently ( 3). Natural language processing uses\ncomputational linguistics and ML algorithms, such as DL, to\nenable computers to understand text in the way humans do (4).\nThus far, one of the most representative examples of AI-based\ntechnologies applied in medicine and oncology are chatbots (also\nknown as chatter robots, smart bots, or digital assistants) (5). These\nare computer programs that use NLP to simulate human\nconversations. They are distinguished by ease of use and a\nstraightforward general architecture based on four main stages\n(input processing and comprehension, followed by response\ngeneration and selection) (5, 6). After entering a query in natural\nlanguage (known as a“prompt”), the chatbot replies with a natural-\nlanguage response. This excha nge of prompts and responses\nestablishes the beginning of a “session” and the overall effect\nmimics a natural human conversation (6). Chatbots are versatile\ntools, as demonstrated by their broad application in oncology,\nincluding remote patient monitoring, emotional support, general\nlifestyle coaching, and physician treatment planning (5, 6).\nIn recent years, the application of DL to NLP has led to\nbreakthroughs in the ﬁeld of generative AI, as evidenced by the\nadvent of large language models (LLMs). Generative AI includes\ntechnologies capable of creating new content in response to\nprompts such as text, images, or other media (7). Large language\nmodels are DL computer models with a vast quantity of parameters\nand trained on highly extensive datasets with unlabeled text. They\ncan recognize, summarize, and generate new content by leveraging\nstatistical associations between letters and words (8). Large language\nmodels can also be considered “few-shot learners ” since once\ntrained, they can adapt to new domains with a small number of\nexamples (9). In the last year, great attention has been captured by\nChatGPT, a new generation chatbot (Chat) developed based on a\nfamily of LLMs called Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)\n(10). Beyond ChatGPT, other new-generation chatbots based on\ndifferent LLMs have been recently released, including Google BARD\n(11), Perplexity (12), and Anthropic Claude (13).\nThe remarkable versatility and potential applicability of LLMs\nto a wide range of tasks were immediately evident following their\nintroduction. Consequently, many studies have aimed to assess the\npotential role of these new-AI technologies in several ﬁelds,\nincluding medicine and healthcare ( 14). In addition, growing\nevidence for its use in oncology has become apparent, as\ndemonstrated by an increasing number of published\ncommentaries, editorials, and letters ( 15, 16). Therefore, we\naimed to describe the published applications and potential impact\nof LLMs.\n2 Methods\nIn this narrative mini review, we summarized the presently\navailable evidence in the biomedical scientiﬁc literature for the\napplication of LLMs to oncology. We searched PubMed for relevant\narticles from its inception to July 12, 2023, without appliedﬁlters.\nThe search terms used for the literature search were discussed and\nestablished a priori by the authors. A two-stage study selection\nprocess (titles and abstracts sc r e e n i n gf o l l o w e db yf u l l - t e x t s\nassessment) was used in the literature search. The eligibility\ncriteria included studies assessing the role of LLMs in cancer care\n(both solid and hematological tumors). We ﬁrst reported the\nﬁndings of the literature search and, then, our perspectives on the\nbeneﬁts, risks, and potential future applications for generative AI-\nbased technology.\n3 Results\nWe found twelve publications assessing the potential of LLMs in\noncology (Table 1). All the studies evaluated ChatGPT alone or in\ncomparison with other LLMs. All the studies evaluated ChatGPT\nalone or in comparison with other LLMs. No studies assessing\nLLMs other than ChatGPT alone were found. Overall, several\ndomains in cancer care were investigated, including both surgical\nand medical care of patients affected by solid tumors. No studies\ninvolving patients with hematological malignancies were found.\n3.1 LLMs as“virtual assistants” in providing\ninformation about cancer\nMost of the published studies aimed to investigate the ability of\nLLMs to provide information by answering questions related to a\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld with overall similar methodologies across studies. In\nthe most frequent paradigm, a group of questions on a speciﬁc topic\nwas created and submitted to one or more LLMs, with some studies\nincluding questions of varying difﬁculty. The resulting output was\nthen assessed by a group of reviewers, and the responses were rated.\nBased on these ratings, the competence of the LLMs to provide\nrelevant and accurate information was determined.\nThe ﬁrst study assessing the accuracy of an LLM in answering\noncologic queries was published by Johnson et al. in December 2022\n(17). Five expert reviewers evaluated the responses provided by\nChatGPT to 13 questions derived from the “Common Cancer\nMyths and Misconceptions” webpage and compared the results\nwith those provided by the National Cancer Institute. Despite some\ndifferences in terms of readability and word count, ChatGPT\nprovided generally accurat e information on this topic ( 17).\nSubsequently, Yeo et al. assessed the ability of ChatGPT to\nanswer questions regarding the management and emotional\nsupport for patients affected by cirrhosis and hepatocellular\ncarcinoma (HCC) (18). Two reviewers assessed responses to 73\nquestions on HCC. Overall, almost three-quarters of the answers\nwere considered correct. However, while a higher rate of accurate\nresponses was found in the categories “basic knowledge ”,\n“treatment”, and “lifestyle”, more than half of the answers in the\n“diagnosis” category contained outdated or incorrect information.\nFurthermore, one-third of the response in this category were\ndeﬁned as incorrect (18). Cao et al. reported the results of a study\nassessing the ability of ChatGPT to provide information on the\nIannantuono et al. 10.3389/fonc.2023.1268915\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org02\ndiagnosis and surveillance of liver cancer. Twenty questions were\nsubmitted to ChatGPT, and the responses were assessed by six\nreviewers. Overall, these res ults demonstrated the poor\nperformance of ChatGPT in providing information on liver\ncancer surveillance and radiological diagnosis (19). Haver et al.\npublished the results of a retrospective study aiming to assess the\nappropriateness of ChatGPT in providing recommendations for\nbreast cancer prevention and screening. Twenty-ﬁve questions were\nsubmitted to ChatGPT, with the majority of the answers considered\nappropriate by the reviewers (20). Moazzam et al. reported the\nresults of an observational study assessing the performance of\nChatGPT in answering 30 questions on surgical care in pancreatic\ncare. The responses were evaluated by 30 reviewers and\ndemonstrated the feasibility of ChatGPT in providing high-\nquality responses in this domain (21). Coskun et al. reported the\nresults of a study assessing the performance of ChatGTP in\nproviding information about prostate cancer. Fifty-nine queries\nwere derived from the European Association of Urology patient\ninformation platform and assessed by two reviewers. The results\nshowed that the accuracy and quality of the content generated by\nChatGPT were not optimal (22).\nIn light of these data, the comparison of answers provided by\nChatGPT with other LLMs yielded interesting results. Zhu et al.\nreported the results of a study assessing the feasibility ofﬁve LLMs\n(ChatGPT [Free and Plus version], NeevaAI, YouChat, Perplexity,\nand Chatsonic) for the provision of healthcare information for\nprostate cancer patients ( 23). Twenty-two questions regarding\nscreening, diagnosis, and treatment options for prostate cancer\nwere designed and submitted to the aforementioned LLMs.\nQuestions were subdivided according to the difﬁculty into “basic”\nand “hard”. ChatGPT had the highest accuracy rate among the\nevaluated LLMs, with the free version proving superior to the paid\nversion (23). In addition, Rahsepar et al. recently published the\nresults of a study assessing the a ccuracy and consistency of\nresponses generated by ChatGPT, Google Bard, Bing, and Google\nsearch engines on the topic of lung cancer screening and prevention\nwith responses assessed by two radiologists. Despite the greater\naccuracy of ChatGPT, none of the LLMs or search engines were able\nto achieve a 100% correct response rate (24).\n3.2 LLMs as“virtual assistants” in making\nclinical decisions\nAlthough the majority of the available studies assessed the\npotential of ChatGPT to answer questions on a speci ﬁc topic,\ninitial studies evaluated ChatGPT as a treatment decision aid in\nvarious clinical case scenarios.\nSorin et al. reported the results of a retrospective study assessing\nChatGPT’s ability to support the clinical decisions of a breast tumor\nboard (25). Here, ten consecutive real-world cases of women\ndiagnosed with breast cancer were submitted to ChatGPT.

Although ChatGPT ’s\nperformance in summarizing these cases and explaining its\nconclusions was highly rated, th e clinical decisions were not\nalways in concordance with those provided by the tumor board\n(25). Another observational study demonstrated the feasibility of\nChatGPT for providing guideline-based treatment decisions in\nsolid-organ oncology cases. Here, over 50 prompts regarding 32\nseparate solid cancers were submitted, and the outputs were\nevaluated via the valid therapy quotient, a surrogate for the\nfraction of acceptable recommendations. In all cases, ChatGPT\nidentiﬁed at least one treatment option suggested by National\nComprehensive Cancer Network guidelines ( 26). Recently,\nHaemmerli et al. described the performance of ChatGPT in\nproviding clinical decisions on adjuvant treatment in patients\nwith gliomas. Ten clinical scenarios derived from an equal\nnumber of patients were submitted to ChatGPT, and the\nresponses were reviewed byﬁve experts. The results demonstrated\nthat ChatGPT performed poorly in classifying glioma types but was\nmore effective in providing adjuvant treatment recommendations\n(27). Finally, O’Hern et al. assessed the performance of ChatGPT in\nproviding appropriate recommendations regarding the surgical\nmanagement of cutaneous neoplasms. Thirty clinical scenarios\nrelated to common and rare cutaneous tumors were submitted to\nChatGPT to determine whether wide local excision or Mohs surgery\nwere appropriate treatment options (28).\n4 Discussion\nSince the term AI was coined in 1956, theﬁeld of medicine has\nattempted to leverage its potential to improve patients’ lives and\nstreamline physician workﬂow (2). Despite initial disappointments,\nrecent improvements in computing power, storage, and speed, have\nset the stage for a revolution in the application of AI in healthcare\n(29). In parallel, the development of superior algorithms, better able\nto analyze large volumes of data, has ﬁnally made feasible the\nmeaningful implementation of AI in medicine (6). Thus far, several\nAI-aided tasks have become a reality in many domains of medicine\nand health care, including coding medical notes, interpreting\nelectrocardiograms, analyzing medical images, identifying high-\nrisk patients, and detecting drug interactions (1). In this context,\nthe recent breakthroughs observed in generative AI technology with\nthe advent of LLMs have provided new perspectives for AI\napplications in medicine and healthcare. Although not speciﬁcally\ntrained for addressing healthcare issues, the potential applications\nof LLMs to this domain were immediately apparent. In particular,\nthe “cultural sensation” resulting from the remarkable versatility of\nChatGPT has captured the scientiﬁc community’s attention (30).\nThe impressive and rapidly increasing number of publications\nindexed in PubMed providing data or perspectives about the\npossible applications of this new generative AI tool is strong\nproof (Figure 1).\nTherefore, we aimed to summarize the available evidence about\nthe applications of LLMs in cancer care. Our results demonstrate\nthat most published studies assessed the potential of ChatGPT as a\n“virtual assistant” for patients or physicians and were characterized\nby a similar methodology. They predominantly evaluate the\npotential for ChatGPT, alone or in comparison with other LLMs,\nto create novel content to answer patient and caregiver queries, with\na smaller subset assessing its role as a treatment decision aid.\nOverall, the available data demonstrate ChatGPT as generally\naccurate when addressing cancer queries – albeit with a\nconsequential error rate. The most recent studies, in contrast,\ncompared ChatGPT with other LLMs, providing relevant\ninformation on the accuracy of ChatGPT in comparison to other\nLLMs. These data are likely to become more relevant over time,\ngiven both the potential increasing role of LLMs in healthcare and\nthe proliferation of different models.\nDespite the excitement generated by the potential applications\nof these new AI tools, some ethical implications related to their use\ndeserve attention. Firstly, the risk of misinformation and distortion\nFIGURE 1\nNumber of publications indexed in PubMed about ChatGPT since its release.\nIannantuono et al. 10.3389/fonc.2023.1268915\nFrontiers inOncology frontiersin.org04\nof scientiﬁc facts is evident and must not be underrated. The\npotential for generating medi cal disinformation is highly\ndangerous and must be addressed by the scientiﬁc community\n(31). As demonstrated by our results, the accuracy rate of ChatGPT\nand other LLMs in the ﬁeld of cancer care is far from 100%.\nTherefore, subsequent veri ﬁcation of the outputs is presently\nmandatory in order to avoid misinterpretation, especially when\ndealing with biomedical data. Secondly, the data used to train\nChatGPT and other major LLM are not publicly available, and\nthus, accurate validation of the information used to produce these\noutputs is not presently possible (10). Additionally, the data used to\ntrain ChatGPT is not updated in real-time and, thus, is highly prone\nto obsolescence – especially in a ﬁeld as rapidly advancing as\noncology (10). Initial evidence suggests that the behavior of the\nsame LLM can also change over time, highlighting the need to\nmonitor their quality continuously ( 32). A potential future\nparadigm may be represented by open-source LLMs trained with\nspeciﬁc datasets in order to accomplish pre-speciﬁed tasks. An\nillustrative example of this perspective is represented by BioGPT, a\ncutting-edge LLM created for the biomedical ﬁeld with a user-\nfriendly interface. BioGPT was built using the same architecture as\nOpenAI’s GPT models but was trained using datasets derived from\nbiomedical literature and, thus, tailored for speciﬁc tasks in the\nbiomedical domain (33).\nIn parallel, several studies assessed the potential for ChatGPT to\nimpact healthcare processes, and, despite not being speci ﬁcally\nrelated to oncology, they merit discussion. ChatGPT’s abilities in\nsummarizing and generating text may be successfully used to\nstreamline some of the more purely bureaucratic tasks which\nthreaten to overwhelm physician s. Initial evidence strongly\nsuggests a role for ChatGPT in generating letters of medical\nnecessity or discharge summaries ( 34). Such automation may\ngreatly facilitate inc reased direct patient- physician interaction\nand, thus, quality of care. Notably, this is a focus of healthcare\ninformatics, with signiﬁcant effort presently ongoing to implement\nthis technology in electronic health records. Additionally, the\nstrengths of LLMs in pattern recognition and correlation analysis\nhave obvious implications for applications to biomedical research\nand the extraction of“real-world” data for clinical research (35).\nOverall, these data highlight the potential for generative AI and\nLLMs to impact medicine positively. Although these tools have not\nbeen speci ﬁcally designed for healthcare purposes, their\ngeneralizability and the breadth of their training datasets have\nalready rendered them remarkably powerful in the biomedical\nﬁeld. Thus, further assessment of its applicability to medicine in\ngeneral and oncology is strongly warranted; insights gained may\nfacilitate the subsequent development of more powerful LLMs\ndesigned for healthcare. However, important issues remain, and\ncaution, along with expert assessment and, initially at least, review\nof the output, is warranted prior to being brought into general use.\nThe potential for generating misinformation remains and must be\nfurther analyzed. Given the potential beneﬁts of this technology and\nits current informal use in the biomedical and healthcareﬁelds, it is\nincumbent upon the scienti ﬁc community to formally and\nscientiﬁcally assess safety and applicability. It is evident that\nPandora’s box has been opened, and potential applications of this\ntechnology are likely to multiply at an accelerating rate.\n5 Conclusion\nThis review showed the potential application of LLMs in\noncology, especially as “virtual assistants” for both patients and\nphysicians. Available evidence strongly focused on assessing the\npotential of ChatGPT that, despite being capable of providing\nadequate information on speci ﬁc cancer types and in certain\nsituations, also demonstrated a signi ﬁcant error rate and a\ntendency towards providing obsolete data. Therefore, an accurate,\nexpert-driven veriﬁcation process remains mandatory to avoid the\npotential for misinformation and incorrect evidence. It will be\nessential in the near future to incorporate this new technology,\ngiven its potential to revolutionize how medicine is practiced.\nHowever, it will also be necessary to develop rules to guide the\napplication of LLMs while maximizing beneﬁts and minimizing\nrisks and harms to providers and, most importantly, patients.\nAuthor contributions\nGI: Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization,\nWriting– original draft.
