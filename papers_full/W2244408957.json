Inspecting transported goods under these conditions\nrequires a convenient and portable device that uses proven methods.  Active nuclear detection can be\nperformed by using neutrons to induce a nuclear reaction in a radioactive material which can then be\ndetected by an appropriate sensor.  The University of Missouri is developing an ultra compact deuterium ion\naccelerator to induce D-D fusion as a source of neutrons for detection purposes.  The proposed accelerator\nutilizes a lithium niobate piezoelectric transformer capable of producing a 100 kV output when driven with a\nlow radio frequency resonant voltage.  The transformer is a Rosen type transformer composed of a rotated\ny-cut polarized rectangular crystal, with the primary voltage applied through the crystal's thickness and the\nsecondary developed along its length.  The transformer will be used to supply and accelerate deuterium\nions by field emission from a tip attached to the crystal's output electrode.  The deuterium ions then impact\na deuterated target inducing a D + D -> 3He + n reaction.  Advantages of this circuit include low power\nconsumption, quick turn on, and compactness.  \r\nA resonant piezoelectric transformer circuit was developed for high voltage generation.  The goal of this\nproject was to produce 100 kV with a reasonably sized piezoelectric crystal.  Several mechanisms leading\nto less than expected high voltage have been addressed.  This project addresses problems associated with\nhigh power, high stress, high voltage, mechanical loss, and high output impedance measurements.  A\nmethod for eliminating unwanted discharges and a technique for measuring the true output voltage of the\ntransformer were tested.  A way to minimize the mechanical stress while creating high voltage was sought. \nThe research performed in this project extended the state of the art for high voltage piezoelectric\ntransformers.  \r\n"
