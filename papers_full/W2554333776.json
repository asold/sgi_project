This\nstudy aims to investigate the effects of mechanical dispersion method on the dispersibility of functionalized TiO 2\nnanoparticles in the transformer oil. Dispersion methods, including stirring, ultrasonic bath, and probe processes,\nwere systematically tested to verify their versatility for preparing stable nanofluid. The test results reveal that the\ncombination of ultrasonic bath process and stirring method has the best dispersion efficiency and the obtained\nnanofluid possesses the highest AC breakdown strength. Specifically, after aging for 168 h, the size of nanoparticles\nin the nanofluid prepared by the combination method has no obvious change, while those obtained by the other\nthree paths are increased obviously.\nKeywords: Dispersion method, Functionalized TiO 2 nanoparticle, Nanofluid, Stability, Breakdown strength\nBackground\nNanofluids are a new type of engineering materials by\ndispersing nanoparticles into the base fluid, which have\nreceived considerable attention for many years due to\ntheir superior thermal and dielectric properties [1 –4].\nTransformer oil, as a cooling and insulating medium, is\na major part of the electrical insulation system in many\ntypes of electrical equipment, such as transformers, ca-\nbles, and bushings. The dielectric strength and thermal\nconductivity of transformer oil are of great importance\nto keep power transformers operating safely and optimize\ntheir structure design. Recently, it has been found that the\npresence of nanoparticles can greatly improve thermal\nconductivity and breakdown strength of transformer oil\n[5–12]. However, the nanoparticles tend to aggregate\ninto bigger particles mainly by the attractive forces and\nexternal stresses [11 –13], leading to the performance\ndegradation of nanofluids. So, the long-term stability of\nnanoparticles dispersion in the host oil is still a key\nchallenge in this field.\nMuch work has been done to improve the dispersion\nstability of the nanoparticles in the base fluid [14 –16]. In\ncomparison with mechanical method, surface functiona-\nlization has been proved to be a more useful approach\nto control the balance of Van der Waals attraction and\nelectrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles through\nsurface modification of nanoparticles [17, 18]. Dispersion\nstability of iron oxide nanoparticles in mineral oil was\ngreatly improved by optimizing their surface functionali-\nzation state and the nanofluid had no visible sedimenta-\ntion after aging for 24 months at room temperature [17].\nThe dispersion of TiO 2 nanoparticles in the mineral oil\ncan also be improved by adjusting the usage of modify-\ning agents to functionalize the nanoparticles [18]. Mean-\nwhile, the adsorption of functional groups on the surface\nof nanoparticles could be influenced by many factors, in-\ncluding temperature, the type of base liquid, and the\ninteraction between functional group and nanoparticle.\nAlthough the mechanical dispersion process can provide\nenergy to overcome the adhesion force between nano-\nparticles, it may affect the interaction between functional\ngroup and nanoparticle at the same time. However, no\nother studies have been found directly point out the ef-\nfect of the mechanical dispersion method on the stability\n* Correspondence: yzlv@ncepu.edu.cn\n1School of Energy, Power and Mechanical Engineering, North China Electric\nPower University, Beijing 102206, China\n2State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable\nEnergy Sources, North China Electric Power University, Beijing 102206, China\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© The Author(s). 2016 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0\nInternational License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and\nreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.\nLv et al. Nanoscale Research Letters  (2016) 11:515 \nDOI 10.1186/s11671-016-1738-5\nand breakdown strength of transformer oil-based nano-\nfluids modified by functionalized nanoparticles.\nIn this paper, TiO 2 nanoparticles functionalized by\noleic acid were synthesized by a solvothermal method.\nThree kinds of mechanical dispersion methods were\nemployed to prepare transformer oil-based TiO 2 nano-\nfluids. The dispersion stability, AC breakdown strength,\nand thermos-physical property of obtained nanofluids\nwere measured and compared.\nMethods\nNanoparticle Synthesis and Functionalization\nTiO2 nanoparticles were prepared and functionalized by\nusing titanium n-butoxide and DI water as reactants by\na solvothermal method. In a typical procedure, reactants\nwere first introduced into a mixed solution of cyclohex-\nane and triethylamine under stirring. After stirring for\n5 min, oleic acid was added into the above solution at\nroom temperature with vigorous agitation. The resulting\nmixture was subsequently heated to the temperature of\n150 °C. After heating for 24 h, the resulting product was\ncooled down naturally and washed with distilled water\nand absolute ethanol for several times to remove the\nions possibly remaining in the product and finally dried\nin the vacuum at 70 °C.\nNanofluid Preparation\nIn order to study the effect of dispersion method on the\nstability of nanofluid, functionalized TiO 2 nanoparticles\nwith the same volume fraction of 0.075% were added\ninto the mineral transformer oil (No. 25 Karamay). After\ntreating for 3 min in ultrasonic bath, the obtained mix-\nture was then divided into 16 parts. The three kinds of\ndispersion instruments are shown in Fig. 1. The six parts\nwere stirred using a magnetic stirrer for a time range\nfrom 10 to 180 min at a rotate speed of 1800 r/m. The\nother six parts were placed in an ultrasonic bath and\ntreated for the same times as that of stirring method at\n20 kHz. Four parts were sonicated by a probe for 10, 20,\n30, and 40 min at 20 kHz, respectively. To avoid over-\nheating, the mixtures were ultra-sonicated for every\n5 min by a break duration about 1 min.\nCharacterization Method\nThe morphology of the as-prepared nanoparticles was\ncharacterized by high-resolution transmission electron\nmicroscopy (HRTEM: JEM-2100F). Fourier transform\ninfrared spectra (FT-IR) was used to analyze the surface\nfunctionalization state of TiO 2 nanoparticles scanned\nfrom 400 to 4000 cm -1 with a resolution of 4 cm -1. A dy-\nnamic light scattering device (Malvern Nano ZS90) was\nused to determine the average size of nanoparticles in\nthe fresh and aged nanofluids. The polydispersity index\n(PdI) describes the width of the particle size distribution.\nThe viscosity of pure oil and nanofluid was measured at\nthe temperature of 29 °C with the rotational viscometer\nBrookfield DVII, and their thermal conductivity was\ncharacterized by a Netzsch LFA447 tester. A portable\nJian-tong Oil Tester 6801 was used to measure AC\nbreakdown voltages of pure oil and nanofluids according\nto IEC standard 60156 using brass spherically capped\nelectrodes set at 2 mm gap.\nResults and Discussion\nMorphology and Surface Functionalization of\nNanoparticles\nThe morphology of the as-prepared TiO 2 nanoparticles\nis shown in Fig. 2. It can be clearly seen that the as-\nprepared nanoparticles have a small average diameter of\n6 nm and exhibit a uniform particle size distribution. No\nobvious aggregation was observed among the nanoparti-\ncles. Moreover, the clear lattice fringes of single nano-\nparticles in Fig. 2b demonstrate the single-crystalline\nnature of the nanoparticles.\nThe FT-IR spectrum of as-prepared TiO 2 nanoparti-\ncles is depicted in Fig. 3. The IR peak around 500 cm -1\nis attributed to the TiO 2, whereas the absorption peaks\nrelated with the functional group of oleic acid are at\nhigher bands [19, 20]. The transmission bands at 3301\nand 1060 cm -1 are due to the presence of hydroxyl\ngroup ( –OH). The bands in the 2919 and 2850 cm -1 re-\ngion are associated with the asymmetric and symmetric\n–CH2– and –CH3 modes of the oleic acid-saturated chain\nfragments. The extra peaks around 902 and 1168 cm -1 can\nbe assigned to stretching vibration of –C–O– groups [21].\nFig. 1 Images of dispersion instruments. a Magnetic stirrer. b Ultrasonic bath. c Probe\nLv et al. Nanoscale Research Letters  (2016) 11:515 Page 2 of 6\nIt should be note that the peak at 1717 cm -1 associated\nwith the C=O stretching mode is not observed in the\nspectrum [22]. This means that no free physically absorbed\noleic acid exists in the nanoparticles.\nThe C=O stretch from oleic acid is replaced by the ap-\npearance of two new peaks at 1554 and 1431 cm -1,\nwhich correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric\ncarboxylate ( –COO–) stretching modes [23, 24]. Studies\nhave shown that these two peaks could be utilized to\npredict the types of binding interaction between the\ncarboxylate head and metal oxide surface [25]. Depend-\ning on the wave number separation between asymmetric\nand symmetric peaks, it is indicated that the functional\ngroup of oleic acid is covalently bonded with the titan-\nium sites at the nanoparticles surface mainly by biden-\ntate linkages [17, 26]. These results confirm that the\ncarboxylate group is chemically bonded with the surface\ntitanium ion, and the as-prepared TiO 2 nanoparticles\nare well functionalized by oleic acid.\nDispersion Stability of Nanofluids\nThe effect of the stirring time on the average size of\nTiO2 nanoparticles in the nanofluids are shown in Fig. 4.\nIt can be seen that the nanoparticle size in the fresh\nnanofluid is dropped down with the increasing of stir-\nring time.\nFor the nanofluid prepared by stirring for 10 min, the\nnanoparticle size is abruptly enlarged from 30.63 to\n72.52 nm with the prolonging of aging time and then\nachieves a constant value of 81.24 nm after aging for\n192 h. With the increasing of stirring time from 30 to\n180 min, the stability of as-prepared nanofluids is greatly\nimproved. The size of nanoparticles in nanofluid stirring\nfor 180 min is smaller than those in other nanofluids,\nwhich is in the range from 18.3 to 20.0 nm during the\naging time of 336 h. In addition, the PdI of particles in\nthis nanofluid is 0.16, indicating the uniform size distri-\nbution of nanoparticles. These test results demonstrate\nthat for the functionalized TiO 2 nanoparticles, the shear\nforce at a high agitation speed can decrease the tendency\nFig. 2 Morphology of as-prepared TiO 2 nanoparticles ( a) TEM image of many nanoparticles ( b) HRTEM image of monodisperse nanoparticles\nFig. 3 FT-IR spectrum of as-prepared TiO 2 nanoparticles\nFig. 4 Nanoparticle size vs. aging time with a variety of\nstirring times\nLv et al. Nanoscale Research Letters  (2016) 11:515 Page 3 of 6\nof particle agglomeration and the nanofluid with a good\ndispersion stability can be observed by stirring for\n180 min.\nThe variation of nanoparticle size in the nanofluids\nwith the aging time by the ultrasonic bath processing is\nstudied and shown in Fig. 5. The nanoparticle size in the\nfresh nanofluids keeps in the range of 18.1 to 21.4 nm\nwith the increasing of ultrasonic treating time, which are\nmuch smaller than those obtained by the stirring\nmethod. This indicates that the ultrasonic bath disper-\nsion is more efficient to prepare well-dispersed nanofluid\ndue to its uniform higher intensity energy input. With\nthe prolonging of treatment time from 30 to 60 min, the\nnanoparticle size is obviously increased and then de-\ncreased when the treatment time is prolonged from 120\nto 180 min. This changing tendency is totally different\nwith that observed in stirri ng dispersion process. It is\nwell-known that the collapse of cavitation bubbles\nunder ultrasonic treatment can release and transfer a\ngood deal of energy into the nanofluid, which greatly\ndecrease the agglomeration of nanoparticles. Meanwhile,\nthe temperature of the nanofluid can be remarkably in-\ncreased with a long-time treatment. This rise of the\ntemperature in nanofluid will influence the adsorption\nequilibrium of functional groups on the surface of nano-\nparticles. By treating for 60 min, the rise of temperature\nprobably makes the functional group begin to detach from\nthe nanoparticles and has no enough time to re-attach, fi-\nnally leading to the agglomeration of nanoparticles. This\ndesorption tendency of functional group is inhibited due\nto the functional group reacts with the surface of nanopar-\nticles when the treating time is prolonged to 120 and\n180 min. In all, the nanofluid obtained by ultrasonic bath\ntreatment for 10 min has the best dispersion stability and\nits nanoparticle size keeps in the range of about 18.1 nm\nwith a PdI value of 0.26 even after aging for 240 h.\nThe average size of nanoparticles in the nanofluids\nultra-sonicated with the probe is shown in Fig. 6. It can\nbe clearly seen that the sizes of nanoparticles in fresh\nnanofluids are decreased from 23.8 (10 min) to 18.4 nm\n(20 and 30 min) first and then increased to 26.5 nm after\ntreated for 40 min, which is 5.7 nm larger than that ob-\ntained by the ultrasonic bath process after treating the\nsame time of 10 min. The nanoparticle size in nanofluid\ntreated for 40 min is abruptly increased to 85 nm and\nmaintained this value after aging for 192 h, while those\nt r e a t e df o r2 0a n d3 0m i nm a i n t a i nb e l o w2 3n ma n de x -\nhibit good stability with a PdI value of 0.31. This value is\nstill 4.9 nm higher than that ob tained by the ultrasonic bath\nmethod, and the uniformity of size distribution is also low-\nered. Although the ultrasonic probe process provides the\nhigher energy to the suspensio n, this high-intensity energy\nis limited around the tip due to its small diameter. With\nthe prolonging of the treatment time, the temperature of\nthe nanofluid tends to greatly increase and the molecules of\nfunctional group on the surface of nanoparticles have a ten-\ndency to decompose into the oil. Then nanoparticles are\nmuch easier to agglomerate with each other, and the stabil-\nity of nanofluid is getting worse. During the ultrasonic\nbath process, a more uniform high-intensity sonication\nenergy is provided and its heating rate is much slower\nthan that in the ultrasonic probe process. Therefore,\nthe average sizes of nanoparticles treated with the bath\na r es i g n i f i c a n t l ys m a l l e rt h a nt h o s eo ft h ep r o b et r e a t e d\nat the same treating time.\nBased on the obtained results, we can see that the stirring\nand ultrasonic bath processes show better dispersion effi-\nciency than ultrasonic probe pr ocess. So, the combination\nof these two methods under their optimum condition was\nused to prepare nanofluid with the same loading of func-\ntionalized nanoparticles. The average size of nanoparticle in\nthe obtained fresh nanofluid and aged nanofluid for 168 h\nFig. 5 Nanoparticle size vs. aging time with a variety of dispersion\ntimes of ultrasonic bath\nFig. 6 Nanoparticle size vs. aging time with a variety of dispersion\ntimes of ultrasonic probe\nLv et al. Nanoscale Research Letters  (2016) 11:515 Page 4 of 6\nis shown in Fig. 7 and compared with those obtained by\nother three methods.\nAfter stirring for 180 min and ultra-sonicated for\n10 min in bath, the size of nanoparticles in the nanofluid\nis 17.6 nm, smaller than those obtained by each method\nindividually. Specifically, after aging for 168 h, the size of\nnanoparticles in the nanofluid prepared by the combin-\nation method has no obvious change, while those ob-\ntained by the other three paths are increased obviously.\nThe AC breakdown voltages of four kinds of fresh nano-\nfluids were tested and compared with that of pure oil.\nAs shown in Fig. 8, all the AC breakdown strength of\nnanofluids are higher than that of the pure oil and the\nnanofluid obtained by the combination dispersion method\nis improved by 32.8%, possessing the highest breakdown\nperformance.\nThe thermal conductivity and viscosity of pure oil\nand nanofluid prepared by the combination method is\nmeasured and shown in Table 1. As can be seen, the\nTiO2 nanofluid shows no obvious improvement com-\npared to the pure oil. The thermal conductivity of\nnanofluid is only increased by 1.2%. It is considered\nthat thermal conductivity of nanofluids is mainly related\nwith the physical nature of base liquid and nanoparticles,\nthe diameter and concentration of nanoparticles. About\n10% enhancement in thermal conductivity of lubricant-\nbased nanofluids has been reported by the presence of\n0.25 wt% TiO 2 nanoparticles [6]. It is considered that the\nenhancement on the thermal conductivity is due to the\nformation of clusters by agglomerated nanoparticles,\nwhich provide channels for thermal waves and transport\nof heat [6, 7]. However, the volume fraction of TiO 2 nano-\nparticles in our nanofluid is only 0.075% and the size of\nnanoparticles keeps uniform around 18 nm. The effects of\nconcentration of TiO 2 nanoparticles and their agglomer-\nation state on the thermos-physical property of trans-\nformer oil-based nanofluids are under study.\nConclusions\nThis study investigated the dispersion stability of function-\nalized TiO 2 nanoparticles in the transformer oil-based\nnanofluids, their AC breakdown strength and thermos-\nphysical property, which were prepared through stirring,\nultrasonic bath, and probe processes. The test results show\nthat the dispersion stability of functionalized nanoparticles\nis clearly dependent on the dispersion method. The stir-\nring and ultrasonic bath processes exhibit better disper-\nsion efficiency than the ultrasonic probe process, which\nmay disrupt the adsorption balance of functional group on\nthe surface of nanoparticles due to the limitation of the\nhigh-intensity sonication energy around the probe tip. The\ncombination method of stirring and ultrasonic bath can\neffectively reduce the tendency for nanoparticles to ag-\nglomerate and prepare the nanofluid with the best disper-\nsion stability and breakdown performance.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina for supporting this research under Contract Nos. 51337003, 51472084,\nand 51477052 and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities\n(JB2015019).\nAuthors’ Contributions\nThe experiments were guided by YL.
