  "abstract": "Pharmacovigilance plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of pharmaceutical products. It involves the systematic monitoring of adverse events and the detection of potential safety concerns related to drugs. Manual literature screening for pharmacovigilance related articles is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, requiring streamlined solutions to cope with the continuous growth of literature. The primary objective of this study is to assess the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating literature screening for pharmacovigilance, aiming to enhance the process by identifying relevant articles more effectively. This study represents a novel application of LLMs including OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Anthropic’s Claude2, in the field of pharmacovigilance, evaluating their ability to categorize medical publications as relevant or irrelevant for safety signal reviews. Our analysis encompassed N-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and evaluating metrics, with a focus on factors impacting accuracy. The findings highlight the promising potential of LLMs in literature screening, achieving a reproducibility of 93%, sensitivity of 97%, and specificity of 67% showcasing notable strengths in terms of reproducibility and sensitivity, although with moderate specificity. Notably, performance improved when models were provided examples consisting of abstracts, labels, and corresponding reasoning explanations. Moreover, our exploration identified several potential contributing factors influencing prediction outcomes. These factors encompassed the choice of key words and prompts, the balance of the examples, and variations in reasoning explanations. By configuring advanced LLMs for efficient screening of extensive literature databases, this study underscores the transformative potential of these models in drug safety monitoring. Furthermore, these insights gained from this study can inform the development of automated systems for pharmacovigilance, contributing to the ongoing efforts to ensure the safety and efficacy of pharmacovigilance products.",
