Prior works have largely\nfocused on mitigating biases in context-free\nrepresentations, with recent shift to contextual\nones. While this is useful for several word and\nsentence-level classiﬁcation tasks, mitigating\nbiases in only the representations may not suf-\nﬁce to use these models for language gener-\nation tasks, such as auto-completion, summa-\nrization, or dialogue generation. In this paper,\nwe propose an approach to mitigate social bi-\nases in BERT, a large pre-trained contextual\nlanguage model, and show its effectiveness in\nﬁll-in-the-blank sentence completion and sum-\nmarization tasks. In addition to mitigating bi-\nases in BERT, which in general acts as an en-\ncoder, we propose lexical co-occurrence-based\nbias penalization in the decoder units in gener-\nation frameworks, and show bias mitigation in\nsummarization. Finally, our approach results\nin better debiasing of BERT-based representa-\ntions compared to post training bias mitigation,\nthus illustrating the efﬁcacy of our approach to\nnot just mitigate biases in representations, but\nalso generate text with reduced biases.\n1 Introduction\nBias can be deﬁned as any kind of preference or\nprejudice toward a speciﬁc individual, group, or\ncommunity over others (Moss-Racusin et al., 2012;\nSun et al., 2019). Unstructured data often con-\ntain several biases, and natural language processing\n(NLP) models trained on them learn and sometimes\namplify them (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Kurita et al.,\n2019; Sheng et al., 2019). In this paper, we focus\non a speciﬁc type of bias called representation bias,\nwhere certain groups are associated with certain\n∗ ∗This work was done when the authors were at Adobe\nResearch.\nHeis veryintelligent.\nSheis verybeautiful.\nThemanhad a job asmanagerat the company.\nThewomanhad a job asreceptionistat the company.\nMyfatherworks as a doctor and mymotheras anurse.\nTheCaucasianman is veryhandsome.\nTheBlackman is veryangry.\nTheCaucasianwoman was known forbeauty.\nTheBlackwoman was known forviolence.\nTable 1: Example sentence completions using BERT.\nidentities, e.g., man is to computer programmer as\nwoman is to homemaker (Bolukbasi et al., 2016).\nBiases in large contextual language models such\nas BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and GPT (Rad-\nford et al., 2019) have been receiving increased\nattention; Tan and Celis (2019) and Zhao et al.\n(2019) analyzed the extent to which contextual\nword representations encode gender and racial bi-\nases, Caliskan et al. (2016), Kurita et al. (2019)\nand May et al. (2019) proposed methods to mea-\nsure biases in these representations, and Liang et al.\n(2020) proposed SENT -DEBIAS to post-hoc debias\nsentence representations from BERT and ELMo.\nWhile biases have been much studied in natural\nlanguage understanding systems, there has been\nvery little work on them in generation tasks. Table\n1 shows a few sentence completions using BERT;\nthey clearly show that the biases encoded in BERT\nare reﬂected when it is used for generation. Sheng\net al. (2019) showed the samples generated using\nGPT-2 with preﬁx templates contain biases against\ndifferent demographics, and proposed regard as a\nmetric to measure biases in generated text. Sheng\net al. (2020) introduced a method using adversarial\ntriggers (Wallace et al., 2019) for controllable bi-\nases in language generation; however, this method\ndoes not debias the whole distribution but only ob-\ntains non-biased continuations of given prompts.\nIn this paper, we aim to mitigate biases during\n4535\nthe learning of distributions in language modelling\nand generation, so that the resulting models and the\ngenerated language are of reduced biases against\ndifferent groups under consideration. First, we in-\ntroduce bias mitigation during model training of\nBERT, byfurther pre-training it on a small dataset,\ncompared to those used for initial pre-training, us-\ning bias mitigation losses in addition to the masked\nlanguage modelling (MLM) objective (Devlin et al.,\n2019). The bias mitigation losses include (a) an\nequalizing loss (Qian et al., 2019) to equalize the\nassociations of words with different groups of a\ngiven demographic, and (b) a novel declustering\nloss that we propose to further decluster the var-\nious clusters of words that may be indicative of\ncertain kind of implicit bias with respect to the de-\nmographic (Gonen and Goldberg, 2019). These\nlosses on an average converge after two to three\nepochs, thus limiting the additional training time to\na maximum of ﬁve hours. We refer to the resulting\nBERT model as DEBIASBERT . Second, we propose\nbias mitigation in the language decoding stage, in\naddition to that during the language modelling and\nencoding stages; we focus on the task of summa-\nrization (Liu and Lapata, 2019) in this paper, and\nthis can be extended to other generation tasks such\nas question answering, paraphrasing, etc.\nThis paper makes four main contributions. (1)\nThis is the ﬁrst known work to (a) address bias\nmitigation during the training of pre-trained con-\ntextual language models (BERT), and (b) handle\nimplicit biases that may not be captured by explicit\nmeasures, using loss functions and further pre-\ntraining of BERT.(2) The representations from DE-\nBIASBERT demonstrate lower biases compared to\nthose obtained by a recent post-processing method\n(Liang et al., 2020), using SEAT (May et al., 2019).\nUsing human evaluations, we show that the sen-\ntence completions obtained using DEBIASBERT\ndemonstrate lower biases compared to those using\nBERT. (3) We propose bias mitigation objective\nin the language decoding stage in text generation\ntasks, speciﬁcally in summarization, and show that\nthe summaries thus obtained contain signiﬁcantly\nlower biases in comparison to those obtained us-\ning a regular encoder-decoder model. (4) Finally,\nwe identify limitations and future directions of our\nwork, which we believe will pave the way for more\neffective identiﬁcation and mitigation of social bi-\nases in language modelling and generation.\n2 Related Work\nThere has been research in studying systems trained\non human-written texts that learn human-like biases\n(Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Caliskan et al., 2016; Sun\net al., 2019). Some of them address allocation bias\n(Crawford, 2017) in which a system unfairly allo-\ncates resources to certain groups over others, repre-\nsentation bias (Crawford, 2017) in which systems\ndetract the social identity and representation of cer-\ntain groups (Bolukbasi et al., 2016), stereotyping in\nwhich existing societal stereotypes are reinforced\n(Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Douglas, 2017; Anne Hen-\ndricks et al., 2018) , under-representation bias in\nwhich certain groups are disproportionately under-\nrepresented (Lu et al., 2018; Garimella et al., 2019),\nand recognition bias in which a recognition algo-\nrithm’s accuracy is lower for certain groups (Dou-\nglas, 2017; Anne Hendricks et al., 2018). Such bi-\nases may occur in multiple parts of an NLP system,\nincluding the training data, resources, pre-trained\nmodels, and algorithms (Bolukbasi et al., 2016;\nCaliskan et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018; Garg et al.,\n2018). The propagation of such biases poses the\nrisk of reinforcing dangerous stereotypes in down-\nstream tasks (Agarwal et al., 2019; Bhaskaran and\nBhallamudi, 2019).\nWhile there exist works on mitigating social bi-\nases in language representations (Bolukbasi et al.,\n2016; Liang et al., 2020), there has been very little\nfocus on debiasing the language models themselves\nor generation systems, speciﬁcally pre-trained lan-\nguage models that are widely used in several gen-\neration tasks. Qian et al. (2019) showed the effec-\ntiveness of mitigating gender bias in word-level\nlanguage models using a gender-equalizing loss\nfunction. Sheng et al. (2020) used adversarial trig-\ngers (Wallace et al., 2019) for controllable biases\nin language generation; however, this method does\nnot debias the whole distribution but only obtains\nnon-biased continuations of given prompts. In this\nwork, we introduce gender and racial bias mitiga-\ntion objectives by further pre-training BERT for\nlanguage modelling, and in the language decod-\ning training for summarization, and observe bias\nmitigation in the resulting text and representations,\nwhile preserving the quality of generated text.\n3 Methodology\nFigure 1 shows an overview of our approach. The\ninput includes a text dataset and a list of target-\ndeﬁned word pairs. In this paper, we study gender\n4536\nFigure 1: Overview of our proposed approach.\nand race as the target demographics, and consider\ntwo demographic groups in each—male and fe-\nmale for gender, and African American and Cau-\ncasian for race—with respect to which biases are\nmitigated. The word pairs include words repre-\nsentative of each group for a given demographic.\nThis can be extended to other demographics with\nthe corresponding word pairs, or word tuples to ad-\ndress more than two groups in a given demographic.\nWe consider BERT, a Transformer (Vaswani et al.,\n2017)-based language model trained on very large\ntext corpora. Our approach involves further pre-\ntraining of BERT on a relatively small corpus with\nbias mitigation objectives in addition to the MLM\nobjective in BERT. We refer to the resulting lan-\nguage model as DEBIASBERT .\nWe show the effectiveness ofDEBIASBERT in (a)\nthe resulting associations between contextual rep-\nresentations, (b) ﬁll-in-the-blank sentence comple-\ntion, and (c) abstractive text summarization. For (c),\nwe use DEBIASBERT as encoder, and a Transformer-\nbased decoder (Liu and Lapata, 2019) in which we\nfurther propose another bias penalization loss. We\nrefer to the resulting encoder-decoder summariza-\ntion model as DEBIASGEN .\n3.1 D EBIASBERT\nAs shown on Figure 1, our method takes a pre-\ntrained language model (BERT) and further pre-\ntrains it on the given dataset, while mitigating the\nexisting social biases using the demographic word\npairs. The approach consists of two stages.\n3.1.1 Equalizing\nFirst, our model attempts to “equalize” the as-\nsociations of every neutral word in the vocabu-\nlary with male and female-deﬁned words for gen-\nder, or African American and Caucasian-deﬁned\nwords for race (Qian et al., 2019). Gender (race)-\ndeﬁned words are those that have a particular gen-\nder (race) deﬁned in them. Gender-deﬁned word\npairs include (she, he), (woman, man), and (girl,\nboy). Race-deﬁned pairs include (Black, Cau-\ncasian) and (Africa, America). we use 65 gender-\ndeﬁned (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Karve et al., 2019;\nBordia and Bowman, 2019) and 6 race-deﬁned\nword pairs (Manzini et al., 2019). Every word\nother than gender (race)-deﬁned word is consid-\nered a neutral word.\nGiven an input sequence, BERT randomly masks\n15% of the tokens, and learns to predict the masked\ntokens based on bidirectional context. In addition\nto the cross-entropy loss to predict the masked to-\nkens, we include equalizing loss with respect to the\ngiven demographic (Qian et al., 2019).\nEqLoss = λ1\nk\n∑k\ni=1 |log(P([groupAi])\nP([groupBi])) | (1)\nλ ≥0 is the equalizing weight, k the number of\ngender (race)-deﬁned word pairs, and groupAand\ngroupB consist of deﬁnition words for the two\ngroups (female and male for gender; African Amer-\nican and Caucasian for race). The goal is to equal-\nize the associations of neutral words with respect\nto the deﬁnition word pairs, which in turn is con-\nsidered as an approximation to equalizing the asso-\nciations with the respective groups.\n3.1.2 Declustering\nEven after equalizing, we notice certain “implicit\nclusters” that form among words, that stereotypi-\ncally associate to one of the given groups (Gonen\nand Goldberg, 2019). For example, words such as\ndelicate and prot´eg´e are essentially gender-neutral,\nbut in practice have strong gender associations,\nwhich reﬂect on or are reﬂected by their neighbor-\ning words. In the case of gender, words such asdel-\n4537\nicate, pink, beautiful, nurse and receptionist cluster\ntogether. Similarly, words such as entrepreneurs,\nprot´eg´e, aspiring, arrogant and bodyguard cluster\ntogether. Moreover, these clusters are collectively\ncloser to female and male-deﬁned words respec-\ntively. For race, words such as blackness, under-\nworld, oversized cluster together and are closer to\nAfrican American-deﬁned words, and words such\nas independent, programmer, conservatives cluster\ntogether and are closer to Caucasian-deﬁned words.\nWe obtain the representations of these words using\nthe sum of the last four layers of the representa-\ntions (Devlin et al., 2019) of their occurrences in\nthe Brown corpus (Kucera and Francis, 1967). We\nuse external signal in the form of Brown corpus as\nopposed to bleached templates,1 as we note that\nusing the latter results in clusters comprising of\nseveral functionally-related words, such as person\nnames for gender and geographically-related words\nfor race (e.g., greenland, alaska for Caucasian),\nthan semantically-related ones. We choose Brown\ncorpus for the external signal as it is built using\nrough estimates of the ratio of genre styles a nor-\nmal human is exposed to daily (Fine et al., 2014).\nIn the second stage, we propose to “decluster”\nthe residual associations among the learned repre-\nsentations. To achieve this, we (a) identify words\nthat form close associations among themselves and\nare closer to a given demographic group, and (b)\nfurther pre-train BERT while ensuring that the asso-\nciations among the identiﬁed words are minimized.\nFor (a), we obtain representations for each word us-\ning Brown corpus as described above, and identify\nwords with the highest projections on the (she-he)\nand (he-she) axes for gender, and (slave-manager)\nand (manager-slave) axes for race. We refer to\nthem as socially-marked female (African Ameri-\ncan) and male (Caucasian) words respectively for\ngender (race). We choose the word pair(slave, man-\nager) as an approximation for (Black, Caucasian)\nfrom (Manzini et al., 2019), as we observe that\nusing the latter pair again results in the highest-\nprojection words on (Caucasian-Black) axis being\nthose that are functionally-similar to Caucasian.\nThe proposed loss function for declustering is\nDeclustLoss=λ|log(\n∑|A|\ni=1P([socialgroupAi])∑|B|\ni=1P([socialgroupBi])) | (2)\n|A|and |B|are the numbers of socially-marked\n1Bleached templates are those that do not convey any in-\nformation other than the given word; e.g., for Caucasian, they\ninclude This is a Caucasian, That is a Caucasian, etc.\nwords for groups A and B respectively (female and\nmale for gender, African American and Caucasian\nfor race). The goal is to decluster the implicit clus-\nters, i.e., for any given word, the percentage of\nsocially-marked neighbors of group A and group B\nshould be more or less equal.\n3.2 D EBIASGEN\nIn this work, we view biases in summarization as\nany potential implications of offending different\ndemographic groups based on the language choice\nto summarize an input article. Due to the lack of\nspeciﬁc notions of what offends certain groups, we\nattempt to avoid language that may be seen as gen-\neralizing any aspect to speciﬁc groups. In tasks like\nsummarization, we note that despite bias mitigation\nobjectives in the encoder, if the input sequence is\nbiased, the output sequence is likely toinherit some\nbias (as shown in Section 4). Hence, bias mitiga-\ntion in summarization is a particularly challenging\ntask, as the generated summaries will have to be\nconditioned on the given input that may contain ex-\nplicitly objectionable or unwanted content, which\nis likely the case in news articles. With DEBIAS -\nBERT as the encoder, we ﬁne-tune a Transformer-\nbased decoder on a given corpus (Liu and Lapata,\n2019) for summarization. Along with negative log\nlikelihood loss in the decoder, we include a bias\npenalizing loss to mitigate input-speciﬁc biases.\nBiasPenalizingLoss=∑|W|\ni=1(ebi ×P(Wi)), (3)\nwhere W is the set of all adjectives and adverbs in\nthe vocabulary,bi is the bias score of word Wi, and\nP(Wi) is the probability of Wi.\nBiasScore,bi(Wi) =1k\n∑kj=1|log(P(groupAj,Wi)\nP(groupBj,Wi))|, (4)\nk is the number of gender (race)-deﬁned words,\ngroupA and groupB contain deﬁnition words\nfor the two groups (female and male for gender,\nAfrican American and Caucasian for race), and\nP(groupAj,Wi) is the probability of jth gender\n(race)-deﬁned word co-occurring with Wi (with\ncontext window 10) in the input articles. For race,\nwe note that the bias scores are much greater than\nthose for gender, and hence propose using (1 +bi)\nas the weight term instead of ebi in computing the\nbias penalizing loss. With bias penalization, the de-\ncoder is trained to choose words and/or sentences\nin the summaries that are less biased, while still\nconveying the important highlights in the input ar-\nticles, and preserving their linguistic quality and\nﬂuency.\n4538\n4 Experiments\nTo obtain DEBIASBERT , we further pre-train BERT\non a given dataset, that is much smaller in size than\nthe Wikipedia and Book Corpus (Zhu et al., 2015)\ndatasets, with MLM and equalizing losses ﬁrst\n(EQUALIZEBERT ), and then with MLM, equalizing,\nand declustering losses ( DEBIASBERT ). For DE-\nBIASGEN , we train a SoTA summarization model\nusing BERT or DEBIASBERT as the encoder, and\na regular decoder or one with the bias penalizing\nloss. For the summarization experiments, we use\nthe framework in (Liu and Lapata, 2019), with a\n6-layered Transformer decoder that is trained from\nthe scratch with a much higher learning rate in\ncomparison to that of the encoder.\nDatasets. We use three datasets to further pre-train\nBERT:(i) CNN/ DailyMail news articles (Hermann\net al., 2015), (ii) WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016)\nthat contains articles extracted from Wikipedia, and\n(iii) Brown corpus (Kucera and Francis, 1967) con-\ntaining stories from 15 genres including politics,\nsports, etc. We consider a maximum of 1M sen-\ntences per dataset, with the number of tokens 24M,\n23M, and 1.2M respectively, and an average of 22\ntokens per sentence.2 We use CNN/DM and XSum\n(Narayan et al., 2018) datasets for summarization,\nwith the same splits as in (Narayan et al., 2018).\nFurther details are provided in Appendix A.\nImplementation Details. BERT is further pre-\ntrained until the various losses converge; equalizing\nrequires approximately 3 epochs for every dataset\nfor both gender and race, and declustering requires\n3 epochs for gender, and 2 for race. The λvalues\nused as weights for equalizing and declustering\nlosses are chosen based on SEAT scores (described\nbelow) obtained using a set of SEAT templates as\nvalidation. The experiments are run on single Tesla\nV100 GPU with BERT-base-uncased model, with\nbatch size 32, learning rate 1e-4, and maximum se-\nquence length 128. Each training experiment takes\napproximately 5 hours. For DEBIASGEN training,\nwe use default parameters for abstractive summa-\nrization as in (Liu and Lapata, 2019), with λ= 1\nfor bias penalizing loss in the decoder. Further\ndetails are provided in Appendix A.\nEvaluation Metrics. To evaluate language mod-\nelling bias mitigation, we use the SEAT score (May\net al., 2019), which measures the associations be-\ntween contextual representations of two sets of tar-\nget concepts (e.g., family and career) and two sets\n2We randomly sample 1M sentences from CNN/DM.\nMODEL GENDER RACE\nBERT 0.355 0.236\nCNN/DAILYMAIL\nPT-BERT 0.352 0.490\nEQUALIZEBERT 0.135 (1) 0.368 (0.25)\nDEBIASBERT 0.100(1) 0.314 (1)\nWIKITEXT-103\nPT-BERT 0.473 0.206\nEQUALIZEBERT 0.173(0.75) 0.132(0.5)\nDEBIASBERT 0.422 (1) 0.284 (1)\nBROWNCORPUS\nPT-BERT 0.373 0.396\nEQUALIZEBERT 0.255 (1.25)0.222(0.75)\nDEBIASBERT 0.172(1) 0.274 (1)\n(Liang et al., 2020)0.256 –\nTable 2: SEAT scores to measure gender and racial biases\nof variants of BERT trained on given datasets.

To measure the bias in generated sum-\nmaries, we propose Constrained Co-Occurrence\n(CCO) score , a variant of Co-Occurrence bias\n(Qian et al., 2019), that estimates bias in given\ntext by comparing co-occurrences of neutral words\nin it with deﬁnition words.\nCCO(text) =1\nN\n∑\nw∈N |log(\n∑\na∈A c(w,a)∑\nb∈B c(w,b)) | (5)\nN is the set of adjectives and adverbs in text, A\nand Bare the gender (race)-deﬁned words (female\nand male for gender; African American and Cau-\ncasian for race), and c(w,d) is the number of co-\noccurrences of word wwith words of dimension d\nin its context (window size 10). CCO ∈{0,∞},\nwith higher values indicating more bias.\n5 Results\n5.1 D EBIASBERT\nRepresentations. SEAT consists of six embedding\nassociation tests for a given demographic.

In the case of\ngender, DEBIASBERT trained on either CNN/DM\n(0.1) or Brown ( 0.172) results in reduced SEAT\nscore compared to that of BERT ( 0.355); when\ntrained on WikiText-103,EQUALIZEBERT achieves\nbest debiasing ( 0.173). Further, the best SEAT\nscores for BERT variant trained on each dataset\n(0.1, 0.173, 0.172) are lower than the SEAT of\nSENT-DEBIAS , the post-processing bias mitigation\nof BERT by Liang et al. (2020), which is 0.256.\nFor race, EQUALIZEBERT achieves least SEAT\nscores when trained on WikiText-103 (0.132) and\nBrown (0.222) datasets, and both EQUALIZEBERT\nand DEBIASBERT result in an increase in SEAT\nwhen trained on CNN/DM. We believe this may be\ndue to two reasons. (1) For race, SEAT uses tem-\nplates around names that may be more likely to oc-\ncur in different racial groups (e.g., Brad is here for\nCaucasian, Hakim is here for African American),\nas opposed to group terms that are used for gender\n(e.g., the boy is here , the girl is here ), to mea-\nsure the associations between contextual represen-\ntations. We believe using names to represent ethnic\ngroups may be superﬁcial and may not effectively\ncapture racial biases and profound world stereo-\ntypes in representations, and this calls for a more\neffective method to measure racial biases. (2) The\nsix word pairs we use to further pre-train BERT for\nracial bias mitigation include (Black, Caucasian),\n(Africa, America), (Black, White), (slave, manager),\n(musician, executive), and (homeless, leader). We\nbelieve that while using pre-deﬁned word pairs has\nbeen successful in mitigating gender biases (Boluk-\nbasi et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2019; Liang et al.,\n2020) perhaps due to the perceived binary nature of\ngender,4 it is not straightforward to use such pairs\n4We acknowledge the rich communities that form other\nor tuples for other demographics such as race, oc-\ncupations, age groups, etc., as these dimensions are\noften of more diversity than gender, and there are\nnot many word-level indications that can represent\nor deﬁne a speciﬁc racial group, other than those\nthat directly mention the group itself. This calls for\nsystematic studies to more effectively identify and\ncapture racial biases in language representations.\nWe also compute the SEAT scores of theDEBI -\nASBERT variants trained for racial bias mitigation\non gender, and vice-versa. DEBIASBERT trained\non CNN/ DM for racial bias mitigation results in\nSEAT of 0.26 for gender bias, while that trained\non WikiText-103 for gender bias mitigation results\nin SEAT of 0.2 for racial bias. These scores in-\ndicate that our method also results in gender bias\nmitigation when models are trained for racial bias\nmitigation, and vice-versa.\nSentence Completion. Table 3 shows sentence\ncompletions for a few templates using BERT and\nthe best DEBIASBERT variants for gender and race,\nwith respect to male and female groups for gender,\nand Caucasian and African American groups for\nrace. The word completions using BERT include\nseveral stereotypical predictions for men (e.g., in-\ntelligent, manager) and women (beautiful, recep-\ntionist), while those by DEBIASBERT are more or\nless “equalized” between the genders. For race,\nwe note that most of the word predictions from\nBERT in the context of African American5 are of\nnegative sentiment (angry, dangerous, evil), while\nthose for Caucasian are comparably more pleasant\n(handsome, patient, helpful, friendly).\nHuman Evaluation. We conduct human evalua-\ntions on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). We use\ngroups of gender. Here, we are referring to research works that\nhave been going on in the scientiﬁc community that primarily\nfocused on two genders.\n5‘Black’ is used for ‘African American’ here, as this is a\nterm colloquially and very frequently used in the datasets.\n4540\n50 templates each for gender and race, and obtain\nthe top 10 word completions for each using BERT\nand DEBIASBERT . The annotations are obtained\nfrom 131 workers for gender, and 140 workers\nfor race. All the workers are of the United States\n(US) background.6 The workers are instructed to\nlabel the word completions from BERT and DEBI -\nASBERT in terms of their ideas of biases against\nthe groups. The templates used are provided in\nAppendix B.\nFor gender, 28% word completions using BERT\nare marked as biased against female, 2% against\nmale, and 8% against both. Only 4% completions\nusing DEBIASBERT are marked as more biased\nagainst either groups. For race, 26% completions\nusing BERT are marked as more biased against\nAfrican American, 2% as more biased against Cau-\ncasian, and 20% as more biased against both; 6%\ncompletions using DEBIASBERT are marked as\nmore biased than those using BERT. The inter-rater\nreliability, as measured by Krippendorff’s alpha\n(Krippendorff, 1970), for gender is 0.279, and that\nfor race is 0.355, indicating a decent agreement\namong the workers particularly in subjective tasks\nsuch as bias identiﬁcation, and comparable to those\nin other subjective tasks such as judging humor\n(Hossain et al., 2019; Garimella et al., 2020).\nThese results support our hypothesis that our ap-\nproach helps mitigate existing gender and racial\nbiases in BERT language model, and outperforms\na post-processing method towards contextual debi-\nasing, without particularly long further pre-training\nhours. For the rest of this paper, we refer to DE-\nBIASBERT as the variant trained on CNN/DM in\nthe case of gender, and EQUALIZEBERT trained on\nWikiText-103 in the case of race.\n5.2 D EBIASGEN\nTable 4 shows summarization results on CNN/DM\nand XSum datasets for gender and race, with or\nwithout bias mitigation in encoder and decoder.\nThe quality, as measured by ROUGE, and linguis-\ntic ﬂuency, as measured by perplexity and SLOR,\nremain more or less the same upon bias mitigation\nin the encoder and (or) decoder, for both gender\nand race on both the datasets. The CCO scores\ndrop upon using an encoder with bias mitigation\n(S1 to S2), and further drop signiﬁcantly upon us-\ning bias penalization in the decoder as well (S3).\n6A very low response rate is observed from workers of\nAfrican-American background, and hence we chose US back-\nground for all workers.\nThus DEBIASBERT , along with bias penalizing in\nthe decoder, helps generate summaries with bias\nmitigation, while maintaining quality and ﬂuency.\nWe also note that debiasing the language decoding\nmodels, in addition to encoders, may be particu-\nlarly important in conditional text generation tasks.\nTable 5 shows a few summaries generated with\nand without bias mitigation in the encoder and\ndecoder models. We note that BERT-based sum-\nmaries sometimes include content that may be ob-\njectionable for one gender (e.g., women also re-\nceived a ‘standard’ 40 lashes ), or mentions of\nracial origin of one group (Somali-American men).\nWhile such information are picked from input ar-\nticles only, their inclusion in the summaries may\nbe seen as being objectionable or generalizing to\nthe entire group. The summaries using DEBIAS -\nBERT +DECODER still include some of these infor-\nmation (for gender), though now we see that the\ncontexts of the said groups (e.g.,women) are not in-\ncluded. The summaries obtained from DEBIASGEN\nconvey the necessary information, while avoiding\nany mention that may offend different groups. This\ncan be seen in the ROUGE scores being more or\nless the same across the summaries (sometimes\neven increasing upon bias mitigation).\nHuman Evaluation. We conduct a survey on the\nresulting summaries for racial bias on AMT. We\nprovide 21 summaries each obtained using BERT-\nbased (S1) and DEBIASGEN (S3) models. We also\nprovide the original summaries as reference, and\nthe workers are instructed to label to what extent\neach of the two summaries is biased against either\nAfrican-American or Caucasian groups, for each\nexample. The annotations are obtained from 82\nworkers, all from US background. In 6 out of the 21\ncases, BERT-based summaries are labelled as more\nbiased against the African-American group, with\nthe Krippendorff’s alpha of0.15. This supports our\nclaim that DEBIASGEN indeed results in reduced\nbiases as compared to BERT-based summarization.\n6 Limitations and Future Work\nFirst, the methods used to mitigate gender biases\nmay not readily extend to other demographics due\nto their greater diversity and lack of straightforward\nwords to represent this diversity beyond the men-\ntions of the groups themselves (e.g.,Asian, African,\nCaucasian). In the future, we aim to study the vari-\nous challenges in the identiﬁcation of racial biases,\nand propose methods to mitigate them. Second, we\n4541\nGENDER RACE\nMODEL R1 R2 RL CCO PPL.

In the future, we aim\nto use general knowledge and the wisdom of crowd\nto identify which associations are to be preserved\nand which to be mitigated, and develop selective\nbias mitigation objectives accordingly. Third, the\nSEAT measure can only predict the presence of a\ngiven type of bias, and not the absence of any poten-\ntial bias in language models (Gonen and Goldberg,\n2019; Liang et al., 2020); while we attempted to\naddress residual clustering of certain words even\nupon equalizing in this work, in the future, we aim\nto work towards devising methods to understand\nand detect more implicit biases in language models.\nFourth, in the future, we aim to use representa-\ntional similarities and world knowledge to devise\nmore effective bias mitigation strategies for lan-\nguage generation models, as bias mitigation using\nword-based co-occurrences (as used in summariza-\ntion) may sometimes lead to redundant bias mitiga-\ntion. Finally, most works on debiasing, including\nours, rely on the availability of word pairs repre-\nsentating different groups. However, these pairs\nhave been manually curated in the studies so far,\nand this may be a bottleneck to extend our work\nto other demographics. In the future, we aim to\nautomatically obtain word indicative of speciﬁc\n4542\ndemographic groups, or the biases against them,\nusing word similarities and associations.\n7 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we addressed the problem of bias\nmitigation in pre-trained contextual language mod-\nels, and proposed an approach to mitigate explicit\nand implicit biases in BERT using existing and our\nproposed loss functions. We showed empirically\nthat our approach achieves better mitigation of the\nencoded biases in BERT representations compared\nto that using post-processing them, while requir-\ning training times only in the range of a few hours.\nWe illustrated the effectiveness of language model\nbias mitigation using human evaluation for sen-\ntence completion, noting that our method in gen-\neral results in less biased completions. Further,\nwe proposed a bias mitigation objective in decoder\ncomponent in summarization frameworks, while\npreserving the quality and ﬂuency of the generated\ntext. Finally, we outlined some limitations of some\nexisting works, including this paper, shedding light\non some future directions to develop better bias\nmitigation techniques for language modelling and\ngeneration. We believe that our approach gener-\nalizes to other demographics (with manual effort\nonly in obtaining the corresponding word tuples),\nand other pre-trained language models.\n8 Ethical Considerations\nWe are committed to following ethical practices\nwhich including protecting the anonymity and pri-\nvacy of all individuals who may have contributed\nto the datasets used to analyze gender and racial\nbiases. Only aggregate datasets have been used\nin this work and all personally identiﬁable infor-\nmation was removed, if available. For the human\nevaluation, we collected annotations from workers\non Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). For each task,\nthe workers are rewarded with$0.65, and each task\non an average requires less than ﬁve minutes.\nThe examples mentioned in the paper are only\nto illustrate the approach and there is no intent for\ndiscrimination. Words such as ‘Black’ are inter-\nchangeably used for ‘African American’, as this is\na term colloquially and very frequently used in the\narticles we are studying, again not with the intent\nto discriminate. We honor and respect all demo-\ngraphic preferences. Our aim, through this work,\nis to help provide technical tools to avoid ampliﬁ-\ncation of discrimination and biases in NLP models\nused for representing and generating language.\nReferences\nOshin Agarwal, Funda Durupınar, Norman I.

In Proceedings of the IEEE inter-\nnational conference on computer vision , pages 19–\n27.\nA Dataset and Implementation Details\nTable 6 shows the statistics of the datasets used for\nlanguage modelling pre-training for DEBIASBERT .\nFor the summarization experiments, the per-GPU\nbatch size for CNN/DM training is 140 (with 1\nGPU), while for XSum it is 280 (with 2 GPUs).\nThe approximate training time for CNN/DM is 32\nhours, while for XSum it is 40 hours. The model\ntraining for DEBIASBERT takes approximately 5\nhours, which is we believe is a small time to train\nfor the bias mitigation we observe in DEBIASBERT\ncompared to the pre-training of BERT. The model\nparameters are same as those of BERT: 12 layers,\n768 hidden size, and 12 self-attention heads, with\na total of 110M parameters.\nB Templates for Human Evaluation\nBelow are the templates used for human evalua-\ntions on AMT. The workers are given the following\ntemplates, along with the top 10 word completions\nobtained from BERT and DEBIASBERT . They are\ninstructed to annotate which of these completions\nare biased toward a speciﬁc gender or racial group.\nGender.
