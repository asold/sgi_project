Introduction \nWith the rapid development of the economy and \nthe increasing demand for electricity, the power \nsupply voltage level of China’s transmission systems \nis also constantly increasing. At this stage, the \ncountry has built and put into operation a number of \nultra-high voltage transmission projects. As one of \nthe main protective and monitoring devices in the \nelectric power system, the current transformer plays \nan important role in collecting and monitoring the \ncurrent information in the operation of the electric \npower system to ensure the safety and reliability of \nthe electricity supply. In recent years, with the rapid \ndevelopment of optical fiber sensing technology [1], \nfiber optic current transformer (FOCT) emerges as a \nnew transformer. It adopts an all-optical fiber \nstructure and has a series of advantages such as good \ninsulation, small size, fine dynamic characteristics, \nand high stability [2]. It overcomes the problems of \nReceived: 21 September 2019 / Revised: 09 January 2020 \n© The Author(s) 2020. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com \nDOI: 10.1007/s13320-020-0581-6 \nArticle type: Regular \n                                                                                             Photonic Sensors  \n \n276\npoor insulation, small dynamic range, and \nsusceptibility to electromagnetic interference \nexisting in traditional electromagnetic current \ntransformers [3, 4] and adapts to the trend of \ndigitalization and intellectualization of the power \nsystem. \nFiber optic current transformer is a kind of \ncurrent sensing device based on Sagnac \ninterferometer theory [5] and Faraday magneto-optic \neffect [6]. At present, most transformers use Y \nwaveguide or piezoelectric ceramic phase modulator \nto realize phase modulation. The generation of bias \nphase and feedback phase depends on the transit \ntime of the optical fiber coil [7]. In order to ensure \nthe time delay required for modulation, an additional \ndelay coil is usually added after the phase modulator, \nwhich inevitably introduces more linear \nbirefringence caused by the stress field [8], which \nreduces system stability and also adds extra volume \nand cost. On the other hand, the mismatch between \nthe delay coil length and the modulation circle \nfrequency causes an error in the phase shift of the \nphase modulator output, which reduces the accuracy \nof the system [9]. During signal detection, the \nsampling frequency will also be affected by the \ntransit time. A short transit time requires a high \nsampling frequency, which will increase the noise \nbandwidth of the system and make it more \nsusceptible to interference, and bring difficulties to \nthe application of FOCT [10]. \nTo address the above problems, this paper \nintroduces a new phase modulation and \ndemodulation scheme for FOCT, and proposes a \nspatial non-reciprocal phase modulation method \nbased on device characteristics. This scheme is to \nphase-modulate light in different axial directions at \nthe same time and directly introduce the phase delay \nbetween the interference lights through the \nmodulation voltage. This method avoids the \nlimitation of the intrinsic frequency [11] to the \nmodulation frequency and enables the system to \nobtain more free sensitivity and dynamic range [12]. \nAt the same time, the phase error introduced by the \nextra delay coil is avoided, and the measurement \naccuracy of the system is improved. According to \nthe refractive index ellipsoid theory of \nelectro-optical crystal, the feasibility of the phase \nmodulation method is analyzed in theory. The \nprototype is designed and used for current \nmeasurement. The feasibility of the scheme is \nverified by experiments. \n2.

Structure diagram of FO CT based on spatial phase \nmodulation method. \nTwo 1 ×2 couplers are used between the light \nsource and the phase modulator to satisfy the \nminimum nonreciprocity on the optical path. The \nworking principle is as follows: the light emitted by \nthe super luminescent diode light source is split into \ntwo paths of linearly polarized light after passing \nthrough the coupler. One beam of linearly polarized \nlight passes through a 90° fusion point and the other \nthrough the phase modulator. After passing through \nthe quarter-wave plate at an angle of 45°, they \nbecome two circularly polarized lights with opposite \nrotation and enter the fiber coil. Due to the Faraday \neffect, the circularly polarized lights transmitted in \nthe fiber coil rotate on the polarization plane, and \nthen become linearly polarized light through the \nquarter-wave plate after being reflected back by the \nmirror. The linearly polarized light carrying phase \ninformation passes through the respective polarizer \nto eliminate the excess polarized light, and then \nYuefeng QI et al.: Novel Fiber Optic Current Transformer With New Phase Modulation Method \n \n277\nenters the photodetector after interfering in the fiber \ncoupler. Finally, digital signal processing is \nperformed on the received light intensity signal to \nobtain the variation of the current. \n2.1 Faraday magneto-optical effect \nFaraday magneto-optical effect means that when \nplane-polarized light passes through a magneto- \noptical medium in the direction of the magnetic field, \nits polarization direction will rotate. The relationship \nbetween rotation angle \nfϕΔ  and magnetic field \nstrength H  is given by \n=df VH lϕΔ                ( 1 )  \nwhere V  is the Verdet constant, and l  is the \ndistance traveled by light in a magneto-optical \nmedium. \nUnder the Faraday effect, the phase of the \ncircularly polarized light will change in advance or \nlag when it passes th rough the magneto-optic \nmedium. There is a phase difference between two \ncircularly polarized beams with different directions \nof rotation [13]. The optical rotation characteristic of \nthe Faraday effect is a non-reciprocal optical process, \nso the total rotation angle of the forward and reverse \ntransmission beams in fiber coil is not zero, but a \nsuperposition of two rotation angles. The intensity \nof the magnetic field generated around the energized \nwire in the fiber coil is \n/2H IR π= , where R  is  \nthe radius of the fiber coil, which is put into (1) to \nget the relationship between the tion angle and the \ncurrent is \n \n4f fVN IϕΔ=               ( 2 )  \nwhere fN  is the number of turns of the fiber ring, \nand I  is the current of the electrified wire. If the \nelectrified wire is a solenoid around the fiber coil, \nthen the above equation becomes \n4f fcVN N IϕΔ=              ( 3 )  \nwhere cN  is the turns of the electrified solenoid.  \n2.2 Principle of the spatial nonreciprocal phase \nmodulator \nThe inherent response of a Sagnac type current \ntransformer is a cosine function. When the phase \ndifference is 0fϕΔ= , the output sensitivity of the \nsystem is very small. In order to obtain the \nmaximum output sensitivity, a phase offset of 90° is \noften introduced to the system by an additional \nphase modulator. At the same time, this phase \nmodulator introduces a feedback phase of \n– fϕΔ , \nwhich makes the system work at the most sensitive \noutput point all the time [14]. \nThe structure of the spatial nonreciprocal phase \nmodulator is shown in Fig.\n 2, which is composed of \npolarizers, Faraday rotators, and a lithium niobate \ncrystal. The modulation scheme of lithium niobate \ncrystal is \ny-direction voltage and z-direction light \ntransmission. The forward transmitted linearly \npolarized light travels along the \ny-axis of lithium \nniobate crystal through the Faraday rotator rotating \n45° clockwise \ncwF . The reversely transmitted \nlinearly polarized light travels along the x-axis of \nlithium niobate crystal through the faraday rotator \nrotating 45° anticlockwise \nccwF . The phase \ndifference mϕΔ  between the two beams is given by \n2 ()mx y nn lπϕ λΔ= −              ( 4 )  \nwhere λ  is the wavelength of the light source, xn  \nand yn  are the refractive index of the crystal x-axis \nand y-axis, and l  is the length of the crystal z-axis. \nFaraday r otatar(cw 45°) Fcw Faraday rotatar(ccw 45°) Fcc wPhase retard er G\nPolar ized \nlight\n45° 45°\nAnticlockwiseClockwise\nPolarizer  1 P1 Polarizer 2 P2\nUnpolarized \nlight\nz\nxy\nyU\nClockwise Anticlockwise\nz \ny x \nUnpolarized\nlight \nPolarized\nlight Uy \n45° 45°\nPolarizer 1 P1  Faraday rotator (cw 45 °)Fcw  Phase retarder G  Faraday rotator (ccw 45 °)Fccw  P o l a n i z e r  2  P2 \n \nFig. 2. Structural diagram of spatial nonreciprocal phase \nmodulator. \nBased on the primary electro-optic effect in \nlithium niobate crystal, the axial refractive index \nwill change under the action of the external electric \nfield, and the refractive index change of the induced \noptical axis is proportional to the first power of the \napplied electric field. Therefore, the nonreciprocal \nphase shift can be produced by controlling the \nelectric field intensity to change the refractive index \n                                                                                             Photonic Sensors  \n \n278\ndifference between the two induced optical axes. A \ntransverse electro-optic modulation [15] with \nelectric field direction perpendicular to the direction \nof light propagation is applied to lithium niobate \ncrystal shown as the voltage \nyU  in Fig.  2. The \nellipsoid of refractive index of the crystal can be \nexpressed as follows: \n22 2\n22 22222\n111 1yy\noo e\nEx Ey znnn γγ   −+ ++ =   \n   \n. \n(5) \nwhere on  is the ordinary refractive index, en  is \nthe extraordinary refractive index, and yE  is the \nelectric field intensity in the y-axis direction of the \ncrystal. Based on the above analysis, we can obtain  \n3\n22\n3\n22\n1\n2\n1\n2\nx oo y\nyo o y\nnn n E\nnn n E\n =+\n =−\nγ\nγ\n.           ( 6 )  \nSubstituting (6) into (4) yields the phase delay of \nthe phase modulator as  \n3\n22\n2=mo y\nlnU dΔ= πϕγ λ            ( 7 )  \nwhere 22γ  is the electro-optic coefficient tensor of \nthe lithium niobate crystal, and d  is the thickness \nin the y-axis direction of the crystal. \nIt can be seen from (7) when the wavelength of \nthe input light source and the size of the lithium \nniobate crystal are determined, the phase delay \ngenerated by the phase modul ator is only related to \nthe voltage applied at both ends of the crystal, and \ndoes not depend on the transit time of the fiber coil. \n2.3 Principle of light intensity signal \ndemodulation \nAccording to the closed-loop detection principle \nof fiber optic gyroscope, a closed-loop detection \nscheme of fiber optic current transformer based on \nthe spatial phase modulation method is proposed. As \nshown in the structure of the collinear current \ntransformer shown in Fig.\n 1, the detected \ninterference light intensity ()dIt  can be expressed \nas follows: \n  () [ 1 c o s ( ) ]do m fIt I ϕϕ=+Δ + Δ        ( 8 )  \nwhere oI  indicates the peak intensity, which is \nrelated to the light output intensity and transmission \nloss.  \nThe closed-loop method of spatial phase \nmodulator is different from the first harmonic \ndetection of piezoelectric ceramics or the digital step \nwave detection of Y waveguide, which adopts \nsawtooth wave modulation, as shown in Fig.\n 3(a). \nThe modulation phase shift of the optical signal \ngenerated by the phase modulator is 2 / tT k\nππ − , \nwhere T  is the period of the modulation signal, \nand k  is an even number. 2 / Tπ  is represented by \ncircular frequency mω , and the interference optical \nintensity signal is  \n() [ 1 c o s ( ) ]do m fIt I tk ωπ ϕ=+ − + Δ .      ( 9 )  \nIn the sawtooth wave signal shown in Fig.  3(a), \nk is an even number, and (9) can be simplified to  \n() [ 1 c o s ( ) ]do mfIt I t ω ϕ=+ + Δ .      ( 1 0 )  \n()tϕ\nt\np \n-p \nt\n2 oI\n()dI t\nfϕΔ\n(a )\n(b)\n–π\n(a) \n(b) \nt\ntΔϕf \nπ\nϕ(t)\nId (t)\n2Io\n \nFig. 3 Relationship between the modulated signal and the \ndetected light intensity. \nThe corresponding relationship between the \nmodulation phase shift a nd the interference light \nintensity is as shown in Fig.  3. When the modulation \nsignal produces a phase shift of a certain angle, the \ninterference light intensity signal also undergoes a \ncorresponding angle translation. Therefore, the /2\nπ  \ntranslation phase can be generated by controlling the \nmodulation voltage of the phase modulator, so that \nYuefeng QI et al.: Novel Fiber Optic Current Transformer With New Phase Modulation Method \n \n279\nthe cosine signal can be converted into sinusoidal \nsignal to achieve the purpose of bias modulation. \nWhen the Faraday phase shift of \nfϕΔ  is detected, \nan additional feedback phase shift – fϕΔ  is \ngenerated to achieve closed-loop feedback \nmodulation, so that the current transformer always \nworks at the working point with the maximum \ndetection sensitivity. It can be seen from (10) that \nthe Faraday phase shift can be obtained by Fourier \ntransform of light intensity signal, and then the \ncorresponding current to be measured can be \nobtained. \n3. Experimental measurements and \nresults analysis \nIn order to verify this scheme, a prototype \ncombined National Instruments data acquisition card \n[16] to sample and demodulate the detection signal \nis designed to measure the primary current and the \ntemperature stability of FOCT. Figure\n 4 shows the \nphysical diagram of the principle prototype. \nFiber \ncoil NI data \nacquisition \nUpper \ncomputer\nPhase \nmodulator \n \nFig. 4 Physical diagram of the prototype. \n3.1 Primary current measurement experiments \nIn the experimental prototype, the fiber coil is \nwinded with circular polarization-maintaining fiber \nfor 40 turns, and the rated current of the current \ntransformer prototype is 1500\n A. The sampling \nfrequency of the prototype is 5  kHz in the \nexperiment. Due to the influence of system error, the \nactual variable ratio of the system should be \ncalculated before measuring the current for \ncalibration. The actual ratio is the ratio of the root \nmean square of the actual primary current to the root \nmean square of the secondary current. The actual \nmeasured ratio of the prototype is 4.363323.  \nA total of 20 experiments were performed at \nroom temperature. In addition to small currents of \n15\n A and 75 A, the current data were recorded every \n100 A from the range of 15  A to 1800  A. The data \nrecorded in the experiment were the current data \nderived from LabVIEW upper computer program. \nFigure\n 5 shows the measurement diagram of FOCT \nwith the primary current of 75  A(5%), 300  A(20%), \n1500 A(100%), and 1800 A(120%), respectively.  \nAs can be seen from Fig.  5, the larger the \nprimary current is, the smaller the noise variation \namplitude in the detected waveform is, and the \nsmaller the ratio of the peak-to-peak value of the \nnoise to the measured current is, the higher the \naccuracy is. In the whole FOCT, the noise does not \ndecrease with the change  of the primary current.\n \nTherefore, it can be determined that the detection \nnoise in the optical path increases with the current \ndecrease, which is in line with the characteristics of \nthe FOCT suitable for large current measurement. \nFor the prototype designed in this paper, it should \nmainly conform to the relevant requirements of \nnational standard GB/T 20840.8-2007, that is, the \nresponse time does not exceed 5\n ms, and the accurate \nlevel should satisfy the error limit of current \ntransformer for special purpose.  In the four groups \nof detection waveforms shown in Fig.  5, the \nresponse time is 2  ms–3 ms, which meets the \nrequirements of relay protection. \nThe scatter diagram is drawn and linearly fitted \nfor 20 groups of measured current data, as shown in \nFig.\n 6.

The ratio error of the current \ntransformer is compared with the 0.2S level \nstipulated by the national standard, as shown in \nTable\n 1. \nTable 1 FOCT ratio error table. \nPercentage of rated \ncurrent \n0.2S standard ratio \nerror /（±%） \nPrototype ratio error \n(%) \n1% 0.75  0.55467 \n5% 0.50 –0.30292 \n20% 0.20  0.06061 \n100% 0.20  0.04907 \n120% 0.20  0.05288 \nIt can be seen from Table  1 that the current \ntransformer using this modulation and demodulation \nscheme conforms to the requirements of 0.2S level \nspecial purpose current transformers specified in \nnational standard GB/T 20840.8-2007 at room \ntemperature.  \nYuefeng QI et al.: Novel Fiber Optic Current Transformer With New Phase Modulation Method \n \n281\n3.2 Temperature stability experiment \nThe measurement accuracy of the experimental \nprototype machine reaches 0.2S level at room \ntemperature. However, both the fiber coil and the \nquarter wave plate are placed in the outdoor \nenvironment for practical applications. The \npolarization state of the optical signal is affected by \nthe environment temperature. Therefore, the \nperformance index of FOCT under the full \ntemperature state, especially the measurement \naccuracy, also needs to meet the requirements.  \nAfter calibrating the FOCT at room temperature, \nthe sensor coil is placed in the temperature- \ncontrolled cabinet to measure the change of its ratio \nerror at different temperatures. The experimental \ntemperature ranged from –40\n℃ to 80 ℃, and the \ndata were recorded every 10 ℃. After reaching the \nset temperature, the sensor coil was heated evenly \nfor 15\n min. Then the rated current of 1500  A was \napplied to the FOCT to record the secondary current \nand calculate the ratio error. \nThe ratio error of the FOCT varies with \ntemperature as shown in Fig.\n 7. It can be seen from \nthe figure that the ratio error of the FOCT is within \n±0.2% in the range of –30\n℃ to 50 ℃, which can \nconform to the measurement requirement of 0.2S \nlevel. \n \n−40 −20 0 20 40 60 80−0.3 \n−0.2 \n−0.1 \n0.0 \n0.1 \n0.2 \n0.3 \nRatio error (%) \nTemperature (℃)  \nFig. 7 Test diagram of FOCT ratio error with temperature \nvariation. \nThe main factors affecting the measurement \naccuracy of the transformer during the experiment \nare the Verdet constant of the sensing fiber and the \nphase delay of the quarter-wave plate. When the \ntemperature changes, the Verdet constant will \nincrease with an increase in  temperature, which will \ncause additional phase difference between two \npolarized lights in the sensing fiber and introduce \ndetection error. The change of phase delay angle of \nquarter-wave plate will cha nge the polarization of \noptical signal and affect the detection accuracy of \nthe system.  \n4. Conclusions \nA new phase modulation and demodulation \nscheme for optical fiber current transformer is \ndescribed in detail. The bias modulation and \nfeedback modulation of the transformer are realized \nby using the primary electro-optical effect of the \nuniaxial crystal to change the refractive index \ndifference between the optical axes. The phase \nmodulator uses sawtooth wave signal as the \nmodulation voltage.\n Fourier transform is performed \non the interfering optical signal to demodulate the \nFaraday phase shift. The phase modulation method \nin this scheme does not depend on the delay time of \nthe fiber coil, which avoids the limitation of the \nmodulation frequency by the intrinsic frequency. At \nthe same time, phase demodulation is also easier to \nimplement. The prototype of the FOCT is built in \norder to verify the reliability of the theory, and the \nmain performance of the prototype is tested. The \nexperimental results show  that under the condition \nof room temperature, the current transformer of the \nscheme satisfies the error limitation of the national \nstandard at the rated current of 1%–120%, and \nachieves the accuracy of 0.2S level.\n In the \ntemperature range of –30 ℃ to 50 ℃, the ratio error \nmeasured under the rated current does not exceed \n±0.2%.  \nAcknowledgment \nThis work was supported by the National \nNatural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. \n                                                                                             Photonic Sensors \n \n282\n61735011), the Science and the Key Research and \nDevelopment Program of Hebei Province (Grant No. \n19251703D), and the Local Science and Technology \nDevelopment Projects of the Central Committee \n(Grant No. 19941708G). \n \nOpen Access  This article is distributed under the terms \nof the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International \nLicense (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and \nreproduction in any medium, provided you give \nappropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, \nprovide a link to the Creative Commons license, and \nindicate if changes were made. \n \nReferences \n[1] B.
