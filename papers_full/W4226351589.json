As a result, the discussions\nthat ED staff have with patients and caregivers during the\ndischarge process regarding what care is required after the ED\nvisit is a significant component of safe practice and quality\npatient care [6].\nDischarge communication among providers, parents, and\npatients occurs at multiple points during an ED visit, and sharing\ninformation related to diagnosis, prognosis, treatment plans,\nand anticipated course of illness is critical for successful\ndischarge to home [7]. Poor compliance and lack of\ncomprehension of discharge instructions have significant clinical\nimplications, including unfinished treatment, poor pain\nmanagement, and possible progression of illness [8]. Deficits\nin the understanding of discharge instructions are widely\ndocumented, ranging from 24% of discharged patients with\npoor understanding of their follow-up plan [9] to patients\ncorrectly identifying only 59% of instructions [10]. A review\nof 48 pediatric ED studies determined that one-third to almost\nhalf of the parents who had visited the ED with their child made\nmedication dosing errors during post-ED home care [11]. Within\nthe complex, fast-paced, highly stressful, and highly distracting\nED environment, discharge communication can take place in\nas little as 76 seconds [12]. As a result, interventions to improve\ncommunication must balance reliability with flexibility across\na wide range of clinical presentations.\nUsing Technology to Improve Discharge\nCommunication and Outcomes\nThe use of information and communication technologies (ICTs)\nin pediatric health care institutions is increasing, as are the\nmultiple ways in which different technologies are deployed.\nExamples include computer kiosks, mobile apps, interactive\ntelevision and whiteboards, electronic health records, videos,\nwebsites, and automated email [13,14]. Technologies create\nnew opportunities for communication and dynamic updates for\npatient care; however, at the same time, they can also introduce\npotential interruptions or changes in clinical workflow [15].\nGreater emphasis on the interplay between the social (people,\nvalues, and norms), technical (tools, hardware, equipment, and\nprocesses), and behavioral (routines, roles, and tasks) aspects\nof ICT implementation in discharge communication could help\naddress some of these barriers [16].\nTo improve the experience of care during and after an ED visit,\nthere is a great need to better leverage the strengths of\ntechnologies to support efficient discharge processes,\nparticularly for nonurgent visits. However, few guidelines exist\nto support health care institutions in decision-making and\nimplementation planning for such technologies. Research on\nthe use of ICT to support care transitions is predicted to grow\nrapidly as patients and clients increasingly demonstrate\npreferences for the use of these technologies in their care [17].\nHealth care providers also recommend better and more\nappropriate use of ICT to support families in self-managing\ncare at home [18]. Despite the communication challenges faced\nby families during this transition point, strain on existing ED\nresources and the lack of standards and implementation\nguidelines remain significant barriers to the widespread adoption\nof electronic discharge communication tools (EDCTs) in\npediatric emergency contexts. Systematic reviews of traditional\npediatric discharge communication practices [19,20] and\ncomputer technology have enabled discharge communication\noutside the ED [21]; however, to our knowledge, there has not\nbeen a comprehensive review of how EDCTs are being used to\nsupport and guide pediatric emergency discharge\ncommunication.\nObjectives and Research Questions\nThis systematic review of academic literature was undertaken\nto identify, appraise, and describe the use of EDCTs in pediatric\nemergency contexts. Our goal is to advance the knowledge base\nfor researchers, technology designers, and decision makers to\nanticipate the impact of their communication tools on the clinical\nworkflow and the optimal ways to measure impact (Textbox\n1).\nJMIR Pediatr Parent 2022 | vol. 5 | iss. 2 | e36878 | p. 2https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2022/2/e36878\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWozney et alJMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nTextbox 1. Guiding questions for review.\nGuiding questions\n• What electronic discharge communication tools (EDCTs) have been evaluated in pediatric emergency departments and published following peer\nreview?\n• What are the features and technical components of these EDCTs?\n• What outcome measures are being examined in the EDCT literature?\n• What is the methodological quality of the studies conducted on EDCTs?\n• What are the implementation context features where EDCTs have been tested?\n• What are the priority research, practice, and policy actions advocated by the authors of research in this domain?\nMethods\nApproach\nThe PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic\nReviews and Meta-Analyses) [22] guidelines were followed,\nand the review was registered with PROSPERO\nCRD42020157500.\nData Sources and Search Strategy\nA comprehensive search strategy using the Population\nIntervention Comparator Outcome framework [23] was\ncodeveloped with an experienced information technician. The\nsearch terms were intentionally broad to capture the range of\nEDCTs. Namely, terms included technology (eg, electronic\ndocuments or web-forms, mobile device apps, patient portals,\nnotification systems, text messages or SMS notifications,\ninteractive online decision trees, automated email, and\nvideo-based programs) used to prompt communication between\ncaregivers/patients and ED staff about the ED visit, and structure\nthe exchange of information, or promote compliance, education,\nand information sharing about what care should be given after\nthe ED visit is over. A total of 7 databases of\npublisher-controlled and gray literature were searched: EBSCO,\nMEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web\nof Science. The original search was conducted in June 2019 and\nwas updated in August 2021 to capture current evidence.\nRecords from 1989 onward were included. Multimedia\nAppendix 1 presents the sample search strategy. The reference\nlists of systematic reviews were also hand searched for primary\nstudies.\nEligibility Criteria\nWe used a broad definition of EDCTs, including tools that\nprompt communication between caregivers and patients and\nED staff about the ED visit and structure the exchange of\ninformation and promote compliance, education, and\ninformation sharing about what care should be given after the\nED visit is over. We did not limit the search to a particular\ntechnology modality; therefore, tools including web-based\ndocuments or web-forms, mobile device apps, patient portals,\nnotification systems, text messages or SMS notifications,\ninteractive web-based decision trees, automated email, and video\nwere eligible for inclusion. As telephone-based services are part\nof Health Canada’s definition of eHealth, we included\nphone-based services under the broad umbrella of electronic\ntools.\nSpecific inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in\nTextbox 2.\nTextbox 2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nInclusion criteria\n• Electronic discharge communication tools (EDCTs) designed for use during or after an emergency department (ED) visit\n• Studies or abstracts that reported outcome data on at least one communication process or communication outcome targeted by the EDCT\n• Studies conducted in pediatric ED\n• Studies conducted in mixed EDs (adult and pediatric) as long as the EDCT was evaluated in a pediatric population, and outcomes were disaggregated\nfor analysis\n• Publicly available in English\nExclusion criteria\n• Educational intervention given to the patient or caregiver while in the ED but not directly associated with the patient’s illness presentation (ie,\nseatbelt safety)\n• Tools only targeting health care provider to health care provider communication\n• Reviews, meta-analyses, research protocols, editorials, and case-studies\nJMIR Pediatr Parent 2022 | vol. 5 | iss. 2 | e36878 | p. 3https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2022/2/e36878\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWozney et alJMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nScreening\nEligibility screening was performed using Covidence software\n[24]. All titles and abstracts were independently reviewed by 2\nreviewers. Discrepancies regarding which studies to include in\nfull-text reviews were resolved by discussion. A total of 2\nreviewers independently assessed the full texts for inclusion.\nDiscrepant classifications were resolved through discussion.\nData Abstraction and Analysis\nThe team co-designed and piloted a structured data extraction\ntable with the 4 studies included in the review. The form\nincluded sections on (1) study identification (eg, type of\npublication, year, and author); (2) methods (eg, study design\nand sample size); (3) delivery settings and demographics (eg,\nED features, age, setting characteristics, and computer\nproficiency); (4) intervention design (eg, design framework,\nfrequency and duration of interaction, tailoring, bidirectional\nfunctionality, content, tool, and primary technology modality);\n(5) outcomes (eg, category of outcome measure, follow-up\nschedule, and covariates); (6) implementation (eg, who\nadministered the tool, training requirements, interoperability,\nand cost); and (7) practice, policy, and research implications\nextracted verbatim from the Discussion and Conclusions\nsections.\nAs a broad range of study designs was anticipated, the Mixed\nMethod Appraisal Tool (MMAT) version 2018 [25] was used\nfor methodological quality appraisal. The MMAT is a 21-item\nchecklist with 5 research designs. Each research design category\nhas 5 quality criteria that are appraised as yes (criterion met)\nand no (criterion not met or cannot tell [unable to tell from text\nif the criterion was met or not]). Assigning studies an overall\nnumerical score based on the ratings of each criterion is\ndiscouraged, because a single number cannot provide insight\ninto which aspects of the study methodology are problematic\n[26]. Instead, we classified studies as having lower\nmethodological quality when they met ≤60% of the MMAT\ncriteria and higher quality when they met >60% of the criteria.\nThis is consistent with the approaches outlined by the MMAT\nauthors [26].\nA reviewer independently conducted data extraction and MMAT\nscoring for all full-text articles. As a quality assurance measure\nand to ensure the accuracy of extraction, a second reviewer\nindependently extracted data from a randomly selected subset\nof 30% of full texts. The results were compared, disagreements\nwere resolved by discussion, and additional instructions for the\ncoder were updated.\nFollowing standard practices for systematic reviews–included\n[27] studies were synthesized using several approaches: (1)\nstructured tabulation to explore patterns in the raw data, (2) vote\ncounting of raw data (eg, reporting on the frequency of different\nstudy features), (3) constructing a common rubric to transform\nqualitative data (eg, lengthy descriptions of the technology\nfeatures) into a simplified quantitative form (eg, assigning tools\nto a modality category), (4) descriptive statistics (eg, range,\nmean, or median) to summarize quantitative data, (5) inductive\nthematic analysis (eg, hierarchical coding of verbatim policy,\npractice, and research implications), and (6) visual depiction of\nsummary data.\nResults\nOverview\nDuplicates were excluded, and 17,827 potential reports were\nreturned. Hand searching of the reference lists of 15 related\nsystematic reviews produced no additional eligible full-text\nreports.

In 13% (7/55) of studies, the discharge\ncommunication tool could be used for multiple presenting\ncomplaints (eg, patients with fever or head injury). Finally, 20%\n(11/55) of the tools were designed for use in any illness\npresentation. Some tools focused on a specific task or a narrow\naspect of discharge communication (eg, medication regimen\nadherence) [70], whereas other tools were multi-focused with\nbroader education, symptom monitoring, and care plan elements\n[57].\nFeatures and Technical Components of EDCTs\nEDCTs support diverse communication pathways among\nproviders, caregivers, patients, and other health care providers.\nMost of the tools targeted communication between an ED health\ncare provider and the parent and caregiver (52/55, 94%) with a\nsmaller number (6/55, 11%) also including communication with\nother health care providers (eg, family physician). One study\nof the Texas Emergency Department Asthma Surveillance\nprograms [68] was an example of a multi-audience tool. In the\nstudy, the ED asthma educator used a Microsoft-based platform\nto individualize an education package for the caregiver (eg,\nselect relevant video segments, figures and graphs, skills\ntraining, and motivational messaging). The plan was shared and\ndiscussed with the caregiver and then printed and sent to the\nfamily’s primary care provider. The educator could also generate\nand print a child-friendly version of the tailored written action\nplan for elementary-aged patients.\nThe primary technology modalities used were videos (20/55,\n36%), kiosks (11/55, 20%), telephone calls (7/55, 13%), and\ntext messaging (6/55, 11%). The remaining modalities include\na wide range of offline stand-alone interactive computer\nprograms and web platforms, mobile apps, interactive websites,\nand web-based games with multiple audiovisual elements. For\nexample, a private multiplayer web-based social game called\niCare Adventure uses noncompetitive gameplay for children\nand parents to explore therapeutic content on an iPad while in\nthe ED waiting room [74].\nA density map of presenting complaints targeted and primary\ntechnology modalities used to deliver the EDCT was generated\n(Tables S1 and S2 in Multimedia Appendix 3). Darker cells\nindicate where the largest number of studies have been\nconducted. Kiosks and videos are the 2 predominant modalities\nused as stand-alone asthma tools. Videos are the most studied\nmodality for less frequently investigated medical concerns (eg,\nvomiting and pain).\nThere was substantial heterogeneity between the studies in the\namount of time and effort required by patients and caregivers\nto use the tool. In all, 42% (23/55) of the tools required\nsingle-use, time-limited interaction (eg, watched one video once\nor entered information at a kiosk once). A total of 3 studies\ninvolved web platforms or interactive computer programs with\nlarger educational components that allowed unlimited access\n(4/34, 12%). A program provided access over a specified\nfollow-up period (eg, 120 hours after discharge) [43]. Multiple\nplanned interactions with a tool typically involved a level of\nautomation (eg, 2 automated text messages twice a week for 4\nweeks) [51] or chronologically sequenced learning modules.\nAll text messaging interventions were automated 1-way\nmessaging of reminders with no option of bidirectional texting\ndirectly with a health care provider.\nDuration of contact with the EDCT (ie, how long it took end\nusers to complete expected tasks) was reported in 31% (17/55)\nof the studies. Among those that did report, the length of contact\ntime for the patient and caregiver ranged from 110 seconds at\na kiosk [37] to 80 minutes (where the latter measured the time\nto complete 5 web-based modules) [63]. A total of 44% (7/17)\nof those reporting took ≤5 minutes to complete, (4/17, 24%)\ntook between 6 and 10 minutes, and 24% (4/17) took >10\nminutes. The interventions (3/17, 18%) that took >12 minutes\nall specifically targeted asthma. Caregiver perceptions of\nfrequency and duration were explored in a study of 243 families\nwhere 66 (27.2%) reported they had “had no time” to enter the\nwebsite [64].\nReported Impacts of EDCTs\nThere was significant heterogeneity in the reported purpose of\ndeploying the EDCT and subsequent outcomes measured. Tables\nS1 and S2 in Multimedia Appendix 4 show a matrix of the\noutcomes measured per mode of EDCT technology delivered.\nThe intensity of shading shows clusters (darker) versus gaps\n(lighter) within technologies.\nThe highest density of evidence was from the study of changes\nin caregiver knowledge after using video-based EDCTs (16\ninstances). The most assessed category of outcomes overall\n(including both primary and secondary) were caregiver and\npatient beliefs and attitudes (eg, confidence in managing at\nhome and level of anxiety; 36 instances), knowledge and\ncomprehension (eg, knowledge about symptoms; 29 instances),\nand health service use (eg, return visits to the ED; 25 instances).\nHealth care provider satisfaction (5 instances) and cost (2\ninstances) were the least measured outcomes across all\ntechnology modalities.\nText message interventions were more likely to be measured\non behavioral outcomes (eg, compliance with medication regime\nand follow-up appointment with primary care), whereas studies\nof video-based EDCTs typically used knowledge\nacquisition–related measures. A randomized controlled trial by\nJové-Blanco et al [46] comparing video discharge instructions\nand standard verbal instructions for gastroenteritis showed that\n49% of the intervention group and 18.6% of the control group\nanswered all knowledge acquisition questions correctly (P<.001)\n[48]. However, EDCTs with greater technological sophistication\ndo not always produce better knowledge outcomes. In a\nhead-to-head trial of a static website and an interactive website\nabout fever, Hart et al [65] unexpectedly found that both\nmodalities had comparable knowledge gains, although caregivers\nwere significantly more satisfied with the interactive version.\nMeasurement of knowledge outcomes occurred largely through\nbespoke self-report questionnaires that assessed general\nknowledge about symptoms, treatment options, medication and\nactivity adherence, and service use [29]. Validated measures\nwere most often cited in relation to patient health status (eg,\nJMIR Pediatr Parent 2022 | vol. 5 | iss. 2 | e36878 | p. 18https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2022/2/e36878\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWozney et alJMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nFaces Pain Scale-Revised and Acute Otitis Media Severity of\nSymptom) and functioning (ie, Acute Asthma Behavioral\nCapability Questionnaire; Integrated Therapeutics Group Child\nAsthma Short Form). No adverse events were reported in any\nof these studies.\nThe directionality of primary outcomes pointed to positive\neffects for the primary measure (44/55, 80%) or no significant\ndifference (10/55, 18%). Only one study reported negative\nfindings with an increase in return visits to the ED after\nreceiving the intervention compared with the control group\n(P<.03) [59]. Often, the authors reported positive primary\noutcomes but mixed results across secondary measures. For\nexample, a study by Baker et al [39] showed increases in\nparental knowledge about fever but no significant differences\nin subsequent health service use. Similarly, a study by Zorc [56]\nshowed significant changes in beliefs about the benefits of\nfollow-up, but medication adherence and ED visits did not\nsignificantly differ at follow-up. Parental satisfaction with\nEDCTs was consistently moderate to high across all technology\nmodalities. However, in some instances, respondents in the\ncontrol condition, typically verbal or written discharge\ninstructions, also reported high levels of satisfaction [46].\nThe ability to tailor information via the EDCT was particularly\nwell received by parents when this option was available. For\nexample, tailored mental health recommendations facilitated\nby electronic screening were perceived by parents as more useful\n(69.5% vs 30.5%) and more practical (71.8% vs 28.2%)\ncompared with verbal instructions [34]. In another study, 23%\nof caregivers’ free text entries in the EDCT provided data that\nwere not contained in the official electronic medical record [35].\nPatient age [72], gender of caregiver [62], and parent education\nlevel [37] were the most frequently reported, statistically\nsignificant covariates vis-à-vis the primary outcome. Of note,\nonly 3 studies reported collecting baseline data on the level of\ncomputer proficiency [28] and none in the past decade.\nImplementation Context Features Where EDCTs Have\nBeen Used\nIn all, 42% (23/55) of the EDCTs were evaluated in at least one\nexplicitly stated urban community. The majority were evaluated\nin pediatric EDs (37/55, 67%) or mixed ED settings (ie, both\nadult and pediatric populations, 13/55, 24%); the rest provided\ninsufficient information to decide. English, Spanish, and Dutch\nwere the only languages in which interventions were available\nand evaluated. No other culturally specific content or culturally\nadaptive features of the interventions were reported. The\ninterventions (12/55, 22%) included baseline racial demographic\nfactors, with most participants being African American or White.\nThe EDCTs were most frequently delivered by research study\nstaff (19/55, 35%), ED health care providers (15/55, 27%), or\nby computers or automated systems (8/55, 15%).\nVery few interventions (3/55, 6%) were tested in studies that\nprovided remuneration to participants. No studies have reported\ninteroperability with other ICT systems within the ED or\nhospitals. The authors of 2 interventions (2/55, 4%) briefly\nmentioned sustainability planning, and 33% (18/55) stated that\ndue consideration should be given to the technical performance\nof the system. Only 2 interventions (2/55, 4%) included details\nof direct costs; a study reported that per patient mean cost for\nvideos was US $61 (SD US $36) versus US $31 (SD US $20)\nfor phones; P<.001 [50]. Another study estimated the operating\nbudget for the tool in “hundreds of dollars” [74]. Privacy and\nsecurity were highlighted as necessary implementation context\nconsiderations in 11% (6/55) of the instances.\nResearch, Practice, and Policy Implications Reported\nby Primary Authors\nNo direct policy or decision-making implications were explicitly\ndiscussed by the primary authors. High-level theming of future\nresearch directions posited by primary authors revealed three\nmain directions: (1) more diverse sample populations that reflect\na wider view of social determinants of health, (2) triangulation\nof data from sources outside of self-report (eg, primary care\nfollow-up data and hospital administrative data), and (3)\nisolating the functionality of the tools to test the impact on\nengagement (eg, increase uptake). Practically, the authors\ngenerally endorsed the use of EDCTs, even if statistically\nsignificant findings were mixed or effect sizes were modest.\nDiscussion\nPrincipal Findings\nThe primary aim of this review was to describe and assess\nevidence based on the EDCTs used in pediatric EDs. The\nevidence base included the principal features, measured\noutcomes, and implication contexts under which they were\nstudied.\nFirst, an important and promising finding of this review is that\nalthough the contextual complexity of EDs poses communicative\nchallenges and risks, there is a growing body of evidence that\nEDCTS have been successfully integrated. Our review found\nat least five studies in each of the 4 major modality categories\n(ie, videos, kiosks, text messaging, and phone-based) and\nnumerous presenting complaints that are among the most\nfrequent reasons for ED visits reported in the literature (asthma,\nfever, head injury, fractures, pain, mental health, etc) [77]. In\nother words, there is growing breadth and depth of positive\nevidence.\nThe evidence base for newer technology modalities, kiosks,\ntext messaging, and web-based games and apps is still maturing,\nwith just under a third of all studies being conducted in the last\n5 years. It is vital to monitor this evidence base as more\nautomated and ambient technologies (eg, chat bots, wearables,\nand artificial intelligence) become normalized. Indeed, they are\nalready being studied in ED communication for the adult\npopulation [78,79]. Our review adds to this dialogue by showing\nthat technological sophistication may not necessarily result in\nclinically meaningful improvements. Videos and phone calls\nalso produced positive changes. In fact, most EDCTs in this\nreview reported at least some positive impact in 80% of cases\nand no adverse events. There is a need to move beyond\ndemonstrating the known value of EDCTs and focus on how to\noptimize which tools for which populations, under which\ncircumstances. This is supported by caregivers reporting high\nsatisfaction regardless of modality or presenting concern. In\nJMIR Pediatr Parent 2022 | vol. 5 | iss. 2 | e36878 | p. 19https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2022/2/e36878\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWozney et alJMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nother words, the technology modality used to support caregivers\nin discharge planning may be less crucial than the opportunity\nto engage with them.\nSecond, our review has shown that EDCTs have been largely\nassessed for changes in cognition (knowledge and beliefs),\nmeaning that we know less about their impact on behavior\n(adherence to treatment regime), therapeutic relationship\n(caregiver-provider rapport), or service use. Our findings and\noverall methodological quality appraisal results point to the\nneed for future meta-analyses to explore the magnitude and\ndirection of effects within specific modalities. Such an analysis\ncould support decision makers in determining which tools are\nfit for different primary purposes, reduction in nonurgent visits\nversus improved experiences of care. Caregivers may be highly\nsatisfied with a tool and experience improved recall and\ncomprehension, but this may not translate into fewer nonurgent\nvisits to the ED in the future. The lack of description provided\nin primary studies related to implementation and environmental\ncontext features contributes to gaps in knowledge about the\nsustainability of these tools, particularly the costs associated\nwith setup and ongoing operations.\nAnother significant finding of this review is that outcomes\nrelated to caregiver-provider rapport were understudied across\nall modalities and for all clinical presentations. This gap in the\nevidence is exacerbated by the few studies that assessed health\ncare provider satisfaction with the tools in general. Assessment\nof their expectations and experiences with EDCTs may help\nilluminate barriers and enablers to uptake, as well as predictors\nof positive and negative client experiences. Recent work on\nquality pediatric communication in EDs [80] points to gaps in\nmeasures of care experiences in a complex, high-stress\nenvironment. Given the diverse implementation contexts for\nEDCTS found in this review, the development of quality\nstandards for discharge communication should consider the role\nof electronic tools, which will undoubtedly continue to mediate\nand moderate care experiences in the future.\nFinally, research designs for EDCTs need to incorporate\nmediators and moderators related to technological functions\n(eg, synchronicity, automation, visual aesthetics, and\ngamification) to determine the minimum viable functions. Our\nfindings suggest that technological complexity is not necessarily\nbetter. Augmenting quantitative self-report survey data with\nobservational, qualitative, and administrative data could help\nmake sense of the aspects of these tools (ie, mechanisms of\nchange) that drive the desired change. For example, there was\nsome evidence that tools take >5 minutes for caregivers to\ncomplete (impact on workflow) and were administered by\nresearch team members rather than health care providers, giving\nus a slightly skewed view of real-world implementation. More\nwork is needed to understand how the duration and frequency\nof interaction with tools (both provider and caregiver or patient)\ncould be optimized for busy ED workflows without adding\nunnecessary complexity to the clinical pathways. Our review\nshowed that over half of the EDCTs studied to date target a\nspecific illness, but this could add burden to health care\nproviders and caregivers who might then need to access and\nnavigate a different tool for each presenting condition.\nThe findings of this review point to several high-impact future\nlines of research to address gaps, including (1) exploring how\ncomputer-mediated communication in pediatric emergency\ncontexts impacts the quality dimensions of communication and\nrapport building (eg, sense of shared decision-making, empathy,\nand active listening), (2) meta-analysis of data subsets within\na particular presenting illness field (eg, asthma) or within a\nsingle well-defined technology modality (eg, kiosks), (3)\ndeveloping taxonomies for electronic discharge communication\ninterventions that capture complex person-to-person and\nperson-to-technology pathways, and (4) use of A or B (ie, split)\ntesting to isolate specific technology features that may be driving\noutcomes so that the least intensive interventions necessary to\nachieve desired outcomes are pursued by developers and\ndecision makers.\nLimitations\nThis study had several limitations. First, mapping the broad\nrelevant literature parameters of EDCTs lacked clarity before\nthe literature search. Terms related to technology, digital\ndevices, and electronic communication were ambiguous in the\nliterature, and our criteria were subject to significant revision\nduring the initial search execution. This resulted in a\nless-focused initial title and abstract screening process. Second,\nthe review included several study abstracts that were not\npublished as full articles, limiting what data could be abstracted\nand fully analyzed. Finally, no taxonomies for presenting\ncomplaints have been validated or published in the literature;\nlikewise, no taxonomies for electronic communication\nmodalities are commonly used. Thus, our heat-map\ncategorizations were based more on practical considerations\nand, to a lesser degree, on theoretically validated distinctions.\nConclusions\nTo our knowledge, there has been no other systematic review\nof the broad evidence related to EDCTs in pediatric EDs. The\nfindings demonstrate that a range of technologies are being used\nsuccessfully. However, it is essential that trials of emerging\ntechnologies use robust and consistent measures of quality\npatient-provider communication, clinician experience,\ncost-effectiveness, and health service use so that influential\nevidence on these outcomes can accumulate.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Catalyst Grant.\nConflicts of Interest\nNone declared.\nJMIR Pediatr Parent 2022 | vol. 5 | iss. 2 | e36878 | p. 20https://pediatrics.jmir.org/2022/2/e36878\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nWozney et alJMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nMultimedia Appendix 1\nMEDLINE @OVID search strategy.\n[DOCX File , 13 KB-Multimedia Appendix 1]\nMultimedia Appendix 2\nMixed Method Appraisal Tool quality appraisal profile.\n[DOCX File , 24 KB-Multimedia Appendix 2]\nMultimedia Appendix 3\nHeat map of technology modalities and frequencies.\n[DOCX File , 16 KB-Multimedia Appendix 3]\nMultimedia Appendix 4\nHeat map of intervention outcomes and frequencies.\n[DOCX File , 17 KB-Multimedia Appendix 4]\nReferences\n1.
