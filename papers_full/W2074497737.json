In its strictest sense, tool use\nis only found in a handful of old world monkeys (OWM) and apes.\nThe only exceptions among new world monkeys (NWM) are the\ncapuchins, which have been reported to use tools both in the\ncaptivity and in the wild [1,2,3]. Such studies have reported that\nthe Cebus is capable to handle rocks to open coconuts, to use\ntoothpicks to push food out of a pipe or to extract molasses\nthrough the orifices of a box [4,5,6]. Recently wild capuchins were\nobserved to fish for termites using twigs, an activity until then only\nseen in chimpanzees [7]. Such complex behaviors are dependent\non versatile grasping ability [8,9]. Accordingly,Cebus have been\nreported to display a wide array of grasping strategies and\nmanipulative, comparable to chimpanzees and humans [10,11].\nDexterous hand ability, and consequently tool use, is associated\nwith the development of primate intelligence and culture [12,13].\nThis adaptive behavior therefore denotes an important evolution-\nary convergence, especially between capuchins and chimpanzees.\nCapuchin tool use seems also dependent on other neurological,\ncognitive and morphological convergences [10,14]. In this sense,\ncapuchins stand as an important model for testing hypotheses\nregarding the evolution of primate cognition.\nComparative anatomical analysis of primates may yield important\nknowledge regarding behavior and phylogeny. More specifically,\nforearm anatomy is crucial to understand manipulative behaviors of\nthe hand. Although a few studies have focused on comparative\nbehavioral assessment of capuchin tool use [8,9], the literature on\ntheir forearm myology is scarce. Early studies have indicated that\nprecision grips were untenable to capuchins due to lack of saddle joint\nin the hand and therefore tool use ability was not related to thumb\nmobility [15,16]. Further behavioral studies, however, have reported\nthat this genus can adduct the thumb towards the index finger,\nfavoring the flexing of the interphalangeal rather than the\nmetacarpophalangeal joint, coined ‘lateral opposability’ [8]. Howev-\ner, there are still no anatomical confirmations of these findings.\nIn the present study, the flexors muscles of the forearm in the\nCebus libidinosus [17] monkey were investigated. Origin, insertion,\narterial branching and innervation of each muscle were charac-\nterized to provide an anatomical understanding of the manual\nskills observed in Cebus. The anatomical observations here were\nthen compared to the analogous muscles found in humans [18]\nand chimpanzees and baboons [19]. The degree of anatomical\nsimilarity among the forearm muscles in these species was\ncompared using the Comparative Anatomy Index (CAI) [20].\nMaterials and Methods\nSamples\nEight adult capuchin specimens (Cebus libidinosus) were used (seven\nmales and one female) weighing from one to three kilograms. No\nanimal was killed for the purposes of this study: four of them suffered\naccidental deaths in their natural habitats and were acquired from\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 7 | e22165\nanatomical collection of the Neuroscience and Behavior of Primates\nLaboratory (NECOP) from the Federal University of Goias-\nCatala˜o-Goias. The remaining of them belonged to the Brazilian\nInstitute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources\n(IBAMA) archive and were donated to the University of Goia´s in\nthe 1970’s. This work was approved by the Institutional Ethical\nCommittee from the Federal University of Goia´s (CoEP-UFG 81/\n2008, authorization from the IBAMA number 15275).\nPreparation of the animals for dissection\nAll procedures involving the animals were done in accordance\nto the guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Animal Experimen-\ntation (COBEA). After the trichotomy with a razor blade, the\nanimals were incubated in water at room temperature for 10–\n12 hours; and then received perfusion, by the femoral vein, 10%\nof formaldehyde with 5% of glycerin for fixation. The animals\nwere conserved in 10% of formaldehyde, in covered opaque cubes,\nto avoid the penetration of light and the evaporation of the\nformaldehyde.\nTo undertake the anatomical observations for the present work,\nafter receiving the specimens at the anatomical collection of the\nFederal University of Goia´s each one was processed, by the first\nauthor, as follows: (1) it received an injection of latex 601-A (Dupont)\nstained with Wandalar red diluted in ammonium hydroxide in the\nabdominal aorta in order to facilitate the visualization of small\narteries; (2) it was incubated in water at room temperature for 10–\n12 hr; and then (3) it received a perfusion of 10% formaldehyde with\n5% glycerin through the femoral vein for fixation. The monkeys were\npreserved in 10% formaldehyde in closed opaque boxes to avoid light\npenetration and formaldehyde evaporation.\nDissection and documentation\nThe dissection of the forearm was performed with emphasis on\nthe flexors muscles of the forearm and registered with a digital\nTable 1.Comparative analyses of the flexor superficial muscles forearm amongCebus libidinosus(C.l.), human (Homo), chimpanzee\n(Pan) and baboon (Papio).\nMuscle Features Cebus libidinosus Homo Pan Papio\nFlexor carpi\nulnaris\nOrigin Medial epicondyle of\nhumerus and olecranon\nHighly similar toC.l.\nCAI = 0.0\nHighly similar toC.l.\nCAI = 0.0\nHighly similar to\nC.l.\nCAI = 0.0\nInsertion Pisiform bone\nInnervation Ulnar nerve\nVascularization Ulnar artery\nPalmaris\nlongus\nOrigin Medial epicondyle\nof humerus\nVariable, may be absent\nSomewhat similar toC.l.\nCAI = 0.425\nHighly similar toC.l.\nCAI = 0.0\nHighly similar to\nC.l.\nCAI = 0,0\nInsertion Palmar aponeurosis\nInnervation Median nerve\nVascularization Ulnar artery\nFlexor\ncarpi\nradialis\nOrigin Medial epicondyle\nof humerus\nSimilar to C.l.\nVascularized by radial\nartery\nCAI = 0.125\nDouble insertion in\nmetacarpal II and III\nSomewhat similar to\nC.l.\nCAI = 0.250\nHighly similar to\nC.l.\nCAI = 0.0\nInsertion Base of metacarpal II\nInnervation Median nerve\nVascularization Ulnar artery\nFlexor\ndigitorum\nsuperficialis\nOrigin Humeral head – medial\nepicondyle of the humerus;\nRadial head – anterior\nsurface of the radius\nThree heads of origin –\nhumeral, radial and ulnar.\nSomewhat similar toC.l.\nCAI = 0.375\nHighly similar toHomo\nSomewhat similar to\nC.l.

The first author of the present paper dissected both sides\nof the eight specimens ofCebus libidinosus. The nomenclature of the\nforelimb muscles follows, whenever it is possible, that used in\nhuman anatomy (The Federative Committee on Anatomical\nTerminology, 1998). When no such parallel was possible, they\nwere referred to following the patterns of the international\nnomenclature from the Human Anatomic Nominal. The data\ncollected were analyzed and compared with the patterns described\nfor human, chimpanzee and baboon species.\nStatistical analysis\nBased on Aversi-Ferreira [20], we used a simple comparative\nnon-parametric method for two different species associated on\nanatomical concepts of normality and variation as nominal\nvariables. Relative frequency (RF) was defined as:RF = (N2nv)/\nN; whereN is the total number of specimens of the sample andnv is\nthe number of individuals presenting variation of the normal\npattern.\nWhen more than one parameter (location, nerve, blood vessel,\norigin and insertion of a muscle) was necessary, they were\nassociated to a specific pondered value with respect to their degree\nof relevance in comparative analysis. Parameters with less\nvariation were ascribed a higher value. Therefore, innervation,\norigin and insertion, and vascularization were ascribed the weighs\n3, 2, 1, respectively.\nThe Pondered Average of Frequencies (PAF) was calculated\nusing the RF values:\nPAF~ RF1:P1ðÞ z RF2:P2ðÞ z RF3:P3ðÞfg =P1zP2zP3\nwhere RF1 is the frequency of the muscle innervation andP1 is 3;\nRF2 is the frequency of the muscle origin andP2 is 2, RF3 is the\nfrequency of the muscle vascularization andP3 is 1.\nTo consider the proximity between the structures studied, the\ndifference in the relative frequency is calculated, or Comparative\nAnatomy Index (CAI) between samples from different species:\nCAI~jPAFi{PAFiij; where indexes i and ii represent samples\n1 and 2.\nFrom the equations above, it follows that the close to zeroCAI\nvalues represents greater similarity between samples it represents,\nwhereas a CAI closer to 1.0 means higher divergence between\nsamples. More specifically, CAI value of 0 indicates high\nsimilarity between the structures analyzed, from 0 to 0.200 as\nsimilar structures, from 0.200 to 0.650 assomewhat similar,\nfrom 0,650 and 1,000 asdissimilar.\nFor the purposes of the present work, theCebus was primarily\nchosen as the reference for comparison against human, chimpan-\nzee and baboon morphology, although they were also analyzed\namong themselves.\nFor example, regarding the muscle flexor carpi radialis,RF was\n1 to all parameters inCebus specimens andRF = 0 was set for the\nabsence of any parameters in the other species.\nThen,\nPAF\nCe~ 1x3ðÞ z 1x2ðÞ z 1x2ðÞ z 1x1ðÞfg =8~1,000;\nPAFH~ 1x3ðÞ z 1x2ðÞ z 1x2ðÞ z 0x1ðÞfg =8~0,875;\nPAFCh~ 1x3ðÞ z 1x2ðÞ z 0x2ðÞ z 1x1ðÞfg =8~0,750;\nPAFB~ 1x3ðÞ z 1x2ðÞ z 1x2ðÞ z 1x1ðÞfg =8~1,000;\nWhere the indexes Ce, H, Ch and B represents respectively\nCebus, humans, chimpanzees and baboons. In order, the first\nparameter is innervation, the second is origin of muscle, the third\nis insertion of muscle, and fourth is vascularization (see table 1).\nNote that vascularization is the only difference betweenCebus and\nhumans whereas insertion differs betweenCebus and chimpanzees\nand no differences were observed betweenCebus and baboons in\nthis muscle.\nFrom these values, the CAI is calculated,\nCAICe-H~ 1,000{0,875jj ~0:125;\nCAICe-Ch~ 1,000{0,750jj ~0:250;\nCAICe-B~ 1,000{1,000jj ~0:000:\nThe CAI calculated indicate that the muscle flexor carpi radialis\nof Cebus and baboons arehighly similar, Cebus and humans are\nsimilar, and Cebus and chimpanzees are somewhat similar\nstructures, according to the parameters adopted here.\nA special case is the palmaris longus muscle that is absent in\n10% of human population [18] and that presents many variations.\nTo calculate the FR, the same purposed pondered values were\nused, but they were adjusted by a 10% decrease to innervation and\nvascularization. Adjustment to origin and insertion were set at\n50% decrease since Gray [18] observed that variations in this\nmuscle occur mainly found at its origin and insertion.\nOther important parameter to be calculated is the ‘Group\nCAI’(GCAI) for structures, such as superficial and deep muscles\nin the forearm, which combines the summationRF of individual\nmuscles summation average of CAI for the species not used as\nreference (Homo, Pan and Papio).

In the present\nstudy, we have expanded on those previous data by applying a\nnon-parametric statistical test (Comparative Anatomy Index) [20]\nto compare the anatomy of the forearm flexor of muscles ofCebus\nlibidinosus with those of other primates that use tools (humans and\nchimpanzees) and to baboons, which has not be reported to show\nthis behavior. We also further expanded the findings of the\nprevious report by applying the same statistical test to forearm\nextensor muscles.\nTable 1 summarizes the similarities and differences across the\nsuperficial muscles forearm fromCebus, Homo, Pan and Papio.\nAccording to Aversi-Ferreira and colleagues [22], the flexor\ncarpi ulnaris muscle and palmaris longus muscle (Figure 1) are\nsimilar in all primates species analyzed here with regards to origin,\ninsertion, innervation and vascularization. Flexor carpi radialis,\nflexor digitorum superficialis and pronator teres muscles, on the\nother hand, (Figure 1) are more similar betweenCebus and Papio.\nThe insertion of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle on pisiform in\nCebus is evident because this bone is well developed in this species.\nIn general, all superficial muscles in theCebus’ forearm present\nsimilarities to the other primates considered here. However,\nconsidering some specific details (shown in table 1), more\nsimilarities, based on the statistical analysis used in the present\nwork, are found between superficial muscles in theCebus and Papio.\nTable 2 indicates the similarities and differences among the\nforearm deep muscles from Cebus, Homo, Pan and Papio, with\nregards to origin, insertion, innervation and vascularization.\nPronator quadratus muscle (Figure 2) is identical in all non-\nhuman primates considered. In humans, however this muscle is\ninnervated by the median nerve [18], not the ulnar nerve as shown\nin non-human primates.\nThe features observed in table 2 indicate that, in general,Cebus\nand Pan show great similarity regarding the flexor digitorum\nprofundus and flexor pollicis longus muscles (CAI = 0.0625 and\nCAI = 0.0, respectively; also Figure 3), closely followed by Homo\n(CAI = 0.0 and CAI = 0.125, respectively). Interestingly, these\nmuscles are more distinct in baboons, especially the digitorum\nprofundus (CAI = 1.0), which was not the case for any superficial\nflexor muscles. The flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis\nlongus muscles are involved in finger (including thumb) move-\nment. This anatomical evidence is consistent with the Cebus’\nmanipulation skills.\nThe bellies of the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis\nlongus muscles are clearly attached to each other, in contrast to\nhumans where bellies are separated and individualized [18].\nIndeed, these differences allow for the hand skills required by\ncapuchins’ arboreal habits, such as grabbing and holding [23].\nThe descriptive analysis of the extensor muscles has been detailed\nin length elsewhere [21] (shown here in Figure 4). Here we provide a\nbrief assessment of those findings under the light of CAI. In Table 3,\nwe show the CAI and GCAI values for the extensor forearm\nmuscles. High similarity (i.e. CAI = 0) betweenCebus, Pan and Papio\nis evident in almost all extensor muscle, except for the deep dorsal\nsub-group. In this sub-group, theCebus’abductor pollicis longus and\nextensor pollicis brevis show a greater similarity to modern humans\nand chimpanzees, respectively. It is important to note that the\nextensor pollicis brevis is not completely differentiated as a distinct\nmuscle from the abductor pollicis longus inCebus or in any other\nprimate, except for humans and gibbons. The fleshy part, which\nconstitutes this bundle, is deeply blended but it is differentiated into\ntwo separate tendons [21]. This configuration is highly similar to\nthat ofPan and it is further differentiated inHomo, but not seen in\nPapio. Interestingly, the deep dorsal sub-group was pointed by [21]\nas the major point, in the forearm, which sets capuchins apart from\nthe remaining new world monkeys.\nSince the majority of forearm muscles acts on the hand and\nfingers, the present study described the anatomy of the capuchin\nforearm muscles and compared them with those of humans,\nchimpanzees and baboons. The superficial group of flexor muscles\nwas more similar to those of baboons (GCAI = 0.00) than\nchimpanzees and humans (GCAI = 0.20 and GCAI = 0.26,\nrespectively). On the other hand, the deep flexor muscles were\nmore similar to those of chimpanzees (GCAI = 0.02). They were\neven found more similar to those of humans (GCAI = 0.167) than\nthose of baboons (GCAI = 0.417). The same pattern was found for\nFigure 2.

Capuchins and\nchimpanzees are both arboreal and terrestrial, and even show an\noccasional bipedalism [25,26]. Higher similarities in deep flexor\nmuscles and extensor muscles between capuchin and chimpanzee,\nas opposed to baboon, suggest a possible link between lifestyle and\nforearm morphology. For instance, baboons do not show a clear\nseparation among the extensor indicis propius, the extensor digiti\nquinti proprius and extensor pollicis brevis muscles, as seen in\ncapuchin and chimpanzee. The only exception among extensor\nmuscles is the extensor pollicis longus muscle. Also, the insertions\nof the extensor muscles in chimpanzees and capuchins are similar\nbetween both species but distinct from those in humans. They\nreflect the predominance of muscular strength over fine hand\nskills, which is associated with arboreal habits [21]. Nevertheless,\nAversi-Ferreira et al., [27] noted that the capuchin shoulder and\narm muscles, which aid in locomotion with thoracic members, are\nmore similar to baboons than chimpanzees.\nAnother important factor regarding complex tool use is thumb\nopposability. Contrary to apes and macaques, capuchins present\nonly lateral opposability [8]. This concept incorporates thumb\nprehensive grips observed in this genus. This finding was later\ncorroborated by [21] which pointed to 3 thumb related move-\nments that distance Cebus from NWM, namely: the extensor\npollicis longus inserts in digit 1 only, abductor pollicis longus’\nanterior part is separated into 2 tendons, and extensor pollicis\nlongus is not completely blended with extensor indicis. These\nfeatures allow the uncoupling of the movements of the thumb from\nother digits. These are important differences that set capuchins\naway from closely related NWM. In the case of capuchin abductor\npollicis longus, there is even higher similarity to humans than\nMuscle Features Cebus libidinosus Homo Pan Papio\nExtensor pollicis\nlongus\nOrigin Posterior surface in the medium\nthird of the ulna and interosseous\nmembrane\nSingle insertion in distal\nphalange of the thumb.\nSomewhat similar to C.l.\nCAI = 0.250\nDescribe as derived\nfrom of a common\nextensor muscle\nprimitive.\nSomewhat similar\nto C.l.\nCAI = 0.22\nSimilar to Pan.\nSomewhat similar to\nC.l.\nCAI = 0.22\nInsertion Bases of the proximal and distal\nphalanges of the thumb\nInnervation posterior interosseous nerve\nVascularization posterior interosseous artery\nExtensor indicis\npropius\nOrigin Posterior surface of the ulna and\ninterosseous membrane\nTendon isolated to\nindex finger.\nSomewhat similar to C.l.\nCAI = 0.22\nHighly similar to C.l.\nCAI = 0.0.\nHighly similar to C.l.\nCAI = 0.0\nInsertion Proximal phalanges of the II, III\nand IV fingers\nInnervation Posterior interosseous nerve\nVascularization Posterior interosseous artery\nAbductor pollicis\nlongus\nOrigin Posterior surface of the ulna,\nradius and interosseous\nmembrane\nHighly similar to C.l.\nCAI = 0.0\nDouble insertion into\nthe trapezoid and\nbase of the\nfirst metacarpal.\nSomewhat similar\nto C.l.\nCAI = 0.250\nSimilar to Pan.\nSomewhat similar to\nC.l.\nCAI = 0.250\nInsertion Base of the first metacarpal\nInnervation Posterior interosseous nerve\nVascularization Posterior interosseous artery\nExtensor pollicis\nbrevis\nOrigin Proximal third of the radius and\ninterosseous membrane\nSingle insertion in distal\nphalange of the thumb,\nSomewhat similar to C.l.\nCAI = 0.250\nHighly similar to C.l.\nCAI = 0.0\nAbsent.

The conjunct rotation that occurs at\nthe capuchin carpo-metacarpal joint, which also allow this relative\nopposability, is more similar to OWM than NWM [28]. These\nfindings confirm the evolutionary convergence of hand and\nforearm anatomy between capuchins and OWM, particularly\nchimpanzees and humans. They also support the high proximity\nin grasping and manipulative tasks among these species [9,10,11].\nFinally, the use of fine, independent hand movement and thumb\nopposability for a wide variety of grasping and manipulation in\ncapuchins is further supported by abundant corticospinal termi-\nnations [29]. These terminations are very dense at the ventral horn\nof cervical segments of the spine, from where motorneurons\noriginate to innervate hand muscles. Rilling and Insel [30] also\nsuggested that the increased number of sensorimotor fibers in\nCebus brain may contribute to the wide variety of grasping\nstrategies and manipulation skills. Capuchins also show high level\nof encephalization indices, in some cases, rivaling those of\nchimpanzees [30,31,32]. The highly developed cognitive skills\nshown by Cebus [33,34] are also critical to solving tasks that\nrequires tools.\nOverall, capuchins’ muscle and neural organization as well as\nbehavioral habits and lifestyle point to an evolutionary conver-\ngence with chimpanzees, and even humans, despite a phylogenetic\nbranching of around 30 million years ago [12]. The role\nphylogenetic constraints on the evolution of the forearm muscles\nof NWM cannot be underplayed: most of these muscles are\nremarkably similar across this very diverse group of primates [21].\nThe myological uncoupling of thumb movement and independent\nfinger movements found capuchins, unique among NWM, is an\nimportant adaptive. The acquisition of such features may have\nallowed for the neurological and cognitive developments of tool\nuse behavior.\nIn conclusion, the forearm anatomical data amassed from the\npresent study as well as previous ones [21,22] support the\nbehavioral grasping and manipulation abilities observed in this\ngenus. Forearm muscle shape and differentiation in capuchins is in\nkeeping with capuchin’s high encephalization indices and\ncognitive skills. These findings further corroborate the evolution-\nary convergence towards an adaptive behavior (tool use) between\nCebus genus and apes.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: TA-F HN CT.
