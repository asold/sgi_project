  "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of labor market demands for Myanmar workers in Japan, and Thailand, focusing on opportunities for individuals without higher education degrees. Leveraging ChatGPT’s text classification and summarization capabilities, we extracted vital insights from extensive job advertisements and social media groups. The dataset comprises 152 job advertisements from Thailand and 30 from Japan, collected in 2023. Our research provides a valuable snapshot of skill demands and job opportunities, offering insights for informed decision-making by both job seekers and international non-governmental organizations. The innovative approach of using ChatGPT highlights its efficacy in understanding labor market dynamics. These findings serve as a foundation for tailored interventions to bridge employment challenges faced by marginalized Myanmar youths.",
