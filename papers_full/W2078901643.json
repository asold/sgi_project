The damage to the \nsolid surface is called tracking which includes two types: one is \ndriven by sustained ac stress and can cause long-term damage to \nthe pressboard surface through accumulative erosion; the other is \ndriven by instant flashover, in which the pressboard surface fibres \nare burnt by the high current arcing [4]. The instant flashovers are \nusually observed during transformer factory impulse tests. For \noperating transformers, with the protection of arresters or co-\ncoordinating rod gaps [5], the instant flashover rarely occurs \nunless in extreme situations, whereas the long-term erosion type \nof tracking is the dominant one, and, over a period of time, it can \ncause irrecoverable carbonized paths to spread on pressboards \nand lead to a final flashover. This type of surface tracking can be \nfound in scrapped old transformers with tree-shaped mark left on \nthe pressboard barriers [1, 3, 6]. Figure 1 shows an example of \nsuch cases. \nDuring long-term tracking, the tree-shaped white mark tends to \nappear on the pressboard surf ace before the formation of \ncarbonized mark. The white mark was considered to be created \nby the evaporation and decomposition of mineral oil and moisture, \ndue to the discharges on the surface layers [1, 3].  \nThe recent work published in [7] and [8], indicated that white \nmark on the dry mineral-oil-impregnated pressboard (moisture \ncontent less than 0.5% by weight) is extremely difficult, if not \npossible, to initiate. On the other hand, white mark can be \ninitiated by discharges on wet pressboards in mineral oil. It is \nclear that moisture should be one of the key factors responsible \nfor the white mark on the mineral-oil-impregnated pressboard in \naged transformers. \n \nFigure 1.  Tree-shaped mark on the pressboard barrier in a scrapped \ntransformer [1].  \nDue to good biodegradability and high resistance to fire risk, \nsynthetic and natural esters have been widely used for distribution \nand traction transformers. However, before applying esters in \nhigh voltage and large power transformers, it is important to \nunderstand the dielectric performance of cellulose-ester \ncomposite insulation, especially its capability to withstand the \nlong-term surface tracking.  \nManuscript received on 23 August 2012, in final form 16 June 2013. \n1626  X. Yi and Z. D. Wang: Surface Trac king on Pressboard in Natural and Synthetic Transformer Liquids under AC Stress \nThis paper addresses the surface tracking phenomenon along \nthe pressboard-ester interface under sustained ac stress. The \nvarious stages of surface tracking and the evolution of the \naccompanying creepage discharge patterns were investigated. The \nsurface tracking process on the pressboard in esters was also \ncompared with that in mineral oil. \n2  TECHNICAL BACKGROUNDS \nIn operating transformers, especially the aged ones, local \nelectric field concentrations might exist, such as sharp edges \ncaused by winding deformation, moisture and particles in oil [1]. \nThese internal defects could initiate discharges. After the \ndischarges are initiated, their propagation from winding to \nwinding is prevented by pressboard cylinders. Instead, the \ndischarges would propagate on the surface of a pressboard along \nwhich the electric field is divergent. Therefore, in many \nlaboratory research, needle-plane electrodes were usually chosen \nto initiate creepage discharges and to study the discharge \npropagation and surface tracking [7-14].  \nRegarding the flashover under impulse stress, it is reported in \n[9, 11, 14] that, for point-plane gaps up to 150 mm, the presence \nof a pressboard barrier does not reduce the 50% breakdown \nvoltage, when compared to an open gap test. The pressboard \nsurface only tends to speed up the creepage streamer. At 50% \nimpulse breakdown voltage, the powerful arc can burn and \ncarbonize the surface fibres, leaving tree-shaped mark on the \npressboard. This instant surface tracking is more significant under \nnegative polarity and on pressboards impregnated by mineral oil \nthan by esters [4].   \nRegarding the creepage discharges under sustained ac stress, \nour previous work [15] found that pressboard surface tends to \npromote the development of discharges, especially those \noccurring in the negative half cycles, and make more discharges \nshift towards the zero-crossing phase angles. These may be \ncaused by the memory effect of pressboard surface for residual \ncharges and low-density channels. Due to higher discharge \nintensity and higher viscosity, esters tend to exhibit the discharge \npromotion effect more evidently than mineral oil, especially when \nthe samples are stressed at a higher voltage. \nWhen the pressboard is overstressed by further increasing the \napplied voltage, tree-shape white mark would appear on the \npressboard surface, as we reported in [16]. In this preliminary \nstudy, how the white mark was initiated and developed into \nflashover was reported, but the carbonized mark as seen in \nscrapped transformers was not observed, as the white mark grew \nfast and soon induced a complete flashover. It was then assumed \nthat the white mark should be a channel of trapped gaseous \nbubbles within the surface layers of pressboard. Based on our \npreliminary work, extensive verification experiments were \nconducted in order to deepen the understanding of the long-term \nsurface tracking mechanisms. In particular, the carbonization \nprocess of white mark was restored and the carbonized mark as \nseen in scrapped transformers was reproduced. Meanwhile, the \ngaseous nature of white mark was proved by verification \nexperiments.  The details are presented in this paper.  \n3 EXPERIMENTAL DESCRIPTIONS \n3.1 LIQUIDS UNDER INVESTIGATION \nA synthetic ester MIDEL 7131 and a natural ester FR3 were \nstudied; a mineral oil Nytro Gemini X was used as the benchmark \nfor cross comparisons. \nThe insulating liquid samples used in the tests were directly \nobtained from barrels without further filtering. During the whole \nperiod of the experiment, the moisture contents of the samples \nwere measured according to Karl Fisher titration method, using \nMetrohm 684 coulometer and 832 Termoprep oven. The moisture \ncontents of the three liquids were below 100 ppm (less than 10% \nof the moisture saturation level) for esters and below 10 ppm (less \nthan 20% of the moisture saturation level) for mineral oil. \n3.2 PRESSBOARD PROCESSING  \nThe pressboard samples were dried in an air circulating oven for \n48 hours at 105 °C. Then the dried samples were transferred into a \nvacuum oven for further drying at 85 °C for 24 hours. Afterwards, \nthe dried pressboard samples were impregnated with insulating \nliquids in the same vacuum oven at 85 °C for another 48 hours. The \npressure in the vacuum oven was kept below 5 mbar. After these \nprocedures, the moisture contents of pressboards impregnated in \nthe three liquids were all below 0.5% by weight and the pressboard \nsamples can thus be defined as dry according to [17]. For mineral-\noil-impregnated pressboards, some dry samples were humidified \nwith a uniform moisture content of about 3.5 or 4.3%. This was \nachieved by placing the dry mineral-oil-impregnated pressboard \ninto a desiccator with the relative humidity controlled by a glycerol-\nwater solution for several months [18].  \n3.3 TEST CONFIGURATION  \nNeedle to plate electrodes were adopted to initiate discharges. \nMedical needles were used as the point electrode. The needles \nwere selected under an optical microscope. The tip radius was \nsteadily controlled between 6-7 μm from the front view and 2-3 \nμm from the lateral view. The half taper shaped needle tip can \nhelp ensure its close contact with the pressboard surface. The \nplate electrode is 60 mm in diameter and 5 mm in edge radius. \nThe gap distance is 50 mm. \nIn the current configuration, the pressboard was in parallel with \nthe needle-plane axial line, so the electric field is the highest along \nthe tangential direction of the pressboard. Therefore, creepage \ndischarges would be aided. If the needle exhibits a slope angle to \nthe pressboard, the tracking would require a higher voltage. In the \nexperiment, multiple samples were tested for each type of liquid. \nThis is to offset the influence of the needle position on the tracking \nprocess, because the pressboard surface is with meshed extrusions, \nand the distribution of fibres and pores in the pressboard exhibits a \ncertain degree of randomness.   \nThe test circuit is shown in Figure 2. An 1 MΩ water resistor \nwas connected between the test cell and the supply transformer. \nThis can limit the energy during breakdown/flashover and reduce \nthe damage to the samples. An over-current relay at the 240 V side \nwas set to trip off the power supply when the current exceeded 3 A. \nAn LDS-6 PD detector was used to measure the apparent charges. \nA 50 Ω resistor and a wideband oscilloscope were used to obtain \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 20, No. 5; October 2013 1627  \ndischarge current signals. A di gital camcorder was utilized to \nrecord the tracking process on the pressboard surface from the front \nview. In addition, the samples were lit up by an intense light source \nand a high-speed CCD camera was used to observe the discharges \nand the generated bubbles from the lateral side.  \n \n        \nFigure 2. Test circuit diagram. \n4   TEST RESULTS \n4.1 INITIAL CONDITIONS FOR SURFACE TRACKING \nAn ac voltage was applied continuously. If there was no visible \ntrace on the pressboard surface within 30 minutes, the voltage \nwas further increased by a step of 4-5 kV, until visible changes on \nthe pressboard surface could be observed by the naked eye.  \nAs shown in Figure 3, at lower voltages, a dark shadow was \nobserved on the pressboard. This indicates the carbonization of \ninsulating liquid and surface cellulose fibres by local discharges. \nWhen the voltage was further increased, a white dot gradually \nappeared on the pressboard surface around the needle tip. The \nwhite dot would expand into a tree-shaped white mark over time.   \n \nMidel 7131, 0.5%\n35.5 kV, 60 min\nFR3, 0.5%\n46.0 kV, 60 min\nGemini X, 0.5%\n50.0 kV , 200 min\nGemini X, 3.5%\n50.0 kV, 200 min\n(a)                           (b)      (c)                           (d)                          \n \nFigure 3. Shadow areas on pressboards around needle tip  \n (the percentages indicate the moisture content by weight).  \nThe white mark was sometimes observed on the \npressboards at 36.5 kV in MIDEL 7131 and at 47.0 kV in \nFR3, after applying the voltage for more than 10 minutes. On \nthe dry pressboard in Gemini X, no white mark was observed \nuntil 52.0 kV at which flashover would occasionally occur. On \nthe wet pressboard with a moisture content of 3.5% in Gemini X, \nat up to 52.0 kV, only a dark shadow area was observed, with its \ncentre dried by the intense discharge around the needle tip. For \nwetter pressboards with a moisture content of 4.3%, a white dot \nwould emerge on three out of four samples tested at 50.0 kV.  \nThe test results above indicate that, only with sufficiently \nintensive discharges, could the white mark be initiated on the \npressboard surface. Particularly, for the pressboard impregnated \nin mineral oil, excessive moisture is necessary to stimulate intense \ndischarges and thus the surface tracking process on the pressboard. \nThis is because of the lower ionization potential of water \nmolecules than that of mineral oil (1 eV compared to above 7 eV \n[19]). Water molecules in wet pressboards can be easily ionized \nand generate intense discharges. \nAfter the emergence of a white mark, the surface tracking was \nobserved and correlated with the discharge signals. The tracking \nprocess and evolutions of the accompanying discharge patterns \nwere found to be similar in the three liquids investigated; \ntherefore, in the following section, only the surface tracking on \nthe pressboard in MIDEL 7131 is given in detail.  \n4.2 SURFACE TRACKING PROCESS ON \nPRESSBOARD IN MIDEL 7131 \nThe surface tracking process on a pressboard sample in \nMIDEL 7131 is shown in Figure 4. The voltage was sustained at \n43.0 kV. The surface tracking process was classified into five \nstages before the final flashover. This is based on correlating the \nphase-resolved PD patterns (Figure 5), the discharge current \nsignals (Figure 6) and the shadowgraph images (Figure 7). The \ndetails are given below. \n4.2.1 STAGE ONE \n4.2.1.1 VISUAL RECORD \nAfter the pressboard was added, spark discharges were \nfrequently observed and they are shown in Figures 4b and 4c.  \n4.2.1.2 PD PATTERN \nThe PD pattern in stage one is shown in Figure 5a. The \nintroduction of the pressboard increased the discharge amplitude \nwhen compared to the test in open gap (2300 pC maximum); but \nthe overall PD pattern did not differ from the open gap test. \n4.2.1.3 DISCHARGE CURRENT SIGNALS \nThe discharge current signals in stage one are shown in Figures \n6a, 6b and 6c. The current signals of discharges occurring in the \npositive half cycles comprised a train of high frequency pulses \nsuperimposing a continuous dc component, whereas the discharge \ncurrent signals in the negative half cycles were composed of a \ntrain of high frequency pulses which were larger and more \ncoarsely spaced at the tail part. The patterns of the discharge \ncurrents in this stage were similar to those in open gap and those \ncreeping along the pressboard surface at lower voltages [15]. \n4.2.1.4 SHADOWGRAPH IMAGES \nAs shown in Figure 7a, at this stage, the discharges had long \nchannels extending along the pressboard surface or in the liquid \nnear the surface, which confirms that discharges in this stage are \nthe liquid type of discharges. \n4.2.2 STAGE TWO \n4.2.2.1  VISUAL RECORD \nThe energy dissipated by the local spark discharges initiated a \nsmall white dot on the surface of the pressboard (shown in Figure \n4d). After the white dot appeared, the spark discharges \nconcentrated on the white dot area (shown in Figure 4e) and \ndrove the extension of the white dot with time.  \n4.2.2.2 PD PATTERN \nAs shown in Figure 5b, the PDs during this stage started to \ndiffer from those in stage one, in terms of both the amplitude and \nthe pattern. The accompanying PDs could be as large as 6000 pC. \nThe phase shift over the zero-crossing instants of the ac voltage \ncan be clearly seen and the discharges occurring around or even \n1628  X.

The current signals were significantly different from \nthose in stage one; they resembled gaseous discharges in terms of \na very fast rising edge and short sustaining time [20]. The pulse \npeak values were up to 60 mA. \n4.2.2.4 SHADOWGRAPH IMAGES \nThe shadowgraph images in Figure 7b show that, at this stage, \na cloud of small gas bubbles rose  from the pressboard surface \naround the needle tip where the electric field was the highest. \nInevitably there would be some bubbles trapped in the surface \nlayers as well.  \nThe gas bubbles near the needle tip area, including both those \ndispersing freely into the liquid and those trapped between the \ncellulose fibres in the pressboard, could easily discharge in the \nhigh electric field; meanwhile the space charges left by discharges \nin the previous half cycles further facilitated the gaseous \ndischarges. These reasons can explain why in this stage, the \ndischarges, and even those around the zero-crossing instants, have \nlarge apparent charges and large discharge current peaks.\n \n4.2.3 STAGE THREE \n4.2.3.1 VISUAL RECORD \nThe growth of a white mark in this stage is shown in Figures \n4g and 4h. The spark discharges disappeared; creepage discharges \nmight be developing underneath the pressboard surface and \ndriving the white mark to expand in both size and length. Bubbles \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 20, No. 5; October 2013 1629  \nrose from the tip and the body of the white mark: some attached \nto the surface of the pressboard and became larger with time; \nwhereas some small bubbles dissipated freely into the liquid. Due \nto the accumulative discharges along the white mark, the root of \nthe white mark was carbonized and turned to black.  \n100 kV\n40 mA 5 ms\n \n100 kV\n40 mA 2 µs\n(a) stage one-liquid type discharges (b) stage one-liquid type discharges, \npositive polarity \n100 kV\n40 mA\n2 µs\n \n100 kV\n40 mA 5 ms\n(c) stage one-liquid type discharges, \nnegative polarity \n(d) stage two-gas type discharges of free \nbubbles \n \n100 kV\n40 mA 5 µs\n \n100kV\n4 mA 5 ms\n(e) stage two-gas type discharges of free \nbubbles at zero crossing instant \n(f) stage three-gas type discharges of \nconstrained bubbles and carbonizations \n \n100 kV\n4 mA 5 µs\n \n100kV\n0.4 mA 5 ms\n(g) stage three-gas type discharges of \nconstrained bubbles and carbonizations \n(h) stage four-weakened gas type \ndischarges of constrained bubbles and \ncarbonizations \nFigure 6.   Evolution of discharge current signal at different stages during \nsurface tracking process on a pressboard in MIDEL 7131 at 43.0 kV . \n4.2.3.2 PD PATTERN \nAt this stage, most PDs decreased dramatically from above \n6000 pC in stage two to below 1000 pC, as shown in Figure 5c.  \n4.2.3.3 DISCHARGE CURRENT SIGNALS \nThe discharge current signals shown in Figures 6f and 6g \nindicate that the discharge current signals were still composed of \nfast pulses, like in stage two, but the pulse peak values were \nmerely 8 mA, much smaller than those in stage two.  \n4.2.3.4 SHADOWGRAPH IMAGES \nThe shadowgraph images for discharges in Figure 7c show that, \nat this stage, fewer small bubbles dissipated from the pressboard \nsurface and they distributed coarsely in the surrounding liquid. \nSome bubbles attached to the pressboard surface and expanded \nwith time.  \nFor the discharges of bubbles trapped in cellulose fibres along \nthe white mark, their spatial propagations were constrained; \nconsequently the discharges of these bubbles were weakened. For \nthe bubbles freely dispersing from the body and the tip of the \nwhite mark into the liquid, they were far from the needle tip, so \ntheir discharges were only of small apparent charges. Apart from \nthis, during the carbonization process, the semi-conductive \ncarbonized channels could easily dissipate the charge carriers and \nhamper the discharges [21], so the discharges along the \ncarbonized traces were also small.  \n4.2.4 STAGE FOUR \n4.2.4.1 VISUAL RECORD \nIn this stage, the white mark kept on growing steadily towards \nthe earthed plane electrode, as shown in Figures 4i and 4l. The \nroots of the white mark channels were further carbonized, with a \ntree-shaped carbonized mark forming on the pressboard surface.  \n4.2.4.2 PD PATTERN \nThe PDs in this stage further decreased to less than 100 pC, as \nshown in Figure 5d. \n4.2.4.3 DISCHARGE CURRENT SIGNALS \nThe discharge currents were still with fast rising edge and short \nsustaining time, like those in stages two and three; however, the \npulse peaks became less than 0.4 mA, as shown in Figure 6h, \nwhich were much smaller than those in stages two and three. The \ncurrents were too small and too fast, so the apparent charges \nobtained by the PD detector were less than 100 pC at this stage.  \n4.2.4.4 SHADOWGRAPH IMAGES \nIn this stage, small bubbles emerged from the pressboard \nsurface and distributed in the surrounding liquid, some bubbles \nattached to the pressboard surface and grew larger with time, as \nshown in Figure 7d. \nThe bubbles caged in or arising from the new channels of the \nwhite mark were farther away from the needle tip and their \ndischarges became much weaker; furthermore, much energy was \nconsumed by carbonizing those channels and the semi-conductive \ncarbonized channels also hampered the discharges. For these \nreasons, the discharges in this stage are extremely small. \n4.2.5 STAGE FIVE \nWhen the head of the white mark nearly reached the opposite \nplate, a luminous flash bridged the white mark and the plane \nelectrode, with part of the flash path beneath the surface layers of \nthe pressboard. The energy associated with the flash was not large \nenough to trip off the power supply, so that more flashes followed \nthe white mark paths. Every time a flash occurred, the pressboard \nwas damaged, with cracks in surface layers and carbonization \ntraces along the white mark paths. This stage with consecutive \nflashes damaging the pressboard is termed as stage five (as shown \nin Figures 4m  to 4o).  \nSince the two electrodes were bridged by the luminous flash, \nthe discharge was not partial discharge anymore, so the apparent \ncharges were not recorded. In case of damage to the resistor and \noscilloscope, the resistor was removed from the circuit. \n4.2.6 COMPLETE FLASHOVER \nWith the flashes repetitively damaging the pressboard surface, \na final flashover occurred; the powerful arc tripped off the power \nsupply, cracked the surface layers of the pressboard and left \nobvious carbonized mark, as shown in Figures 4p to 4r.  \nThe discharge patterns shown above indicate that the \nappearance of white mark makes the discharge patterns         \n \nmore diverse and complicated.

Evolution of discharge phenomena shown by shadowgraph images during surface tracking process on a pressboard in MIDEL7131 at 43.0 kV . \ndischarges are not only governed by the insulating liquid and the \npressboard, but also by gas pockets; discharges in solid, liquid \nand gaseous states are all involved in the surface tracking process.  \nEspecially, the gaseous discharges in trapped bubbles dominate \nthe development of tracking. This is uniquely associated with the \npressboard-liquid composite structure, as impregnated pressboard \nis a porous and fibrous material. \nAfter tracking is initiated by high energy dissipation, the liquid \npockets between cellulose fibres can discharge easily around the \nneedle tip, and evaporate and decompose into bubbles. These \nbubbles can be trapped and further enhance discharges. In this \ncontext, discharges develop both ‘on’ and ‘into’ the surface layers. \nWhereas for the dense and smooth solid materials, such as \nPerspex and glass, the creepage discharges are mainly influenced \nby surface charging and bubble residence [10, 12]. Under those \nconditions, the creepage discharges develop ‘on’ the surface. \nOn different pressboard samples, the tree-shaped mark differs \nin the shape and the growing time. For the three samples \ninvestigated at 43.0 kV, the growing time of the white mark from \nthe inception to the stage of bridging the whole gap were 40, 55 \nand 62 minutes, respectively. These differences are reasonable, \nsince the alignment of cellulose fibres in each pressboard would \nhave a degree of randomness and hence the liquid pores where \nthe white mark grows would randomly differ in the same manner \n[8].  \nThe current configuration with 50 mm gap is a miniature \nmodel for the pressboard barriers in transformers. If the gap \ndistance is larger, it is expected that it takes longer time for the \ntree-shaped mark to span the gap and induce a final flashover. \n4.3 SURFACE TRACKING PROCESS ON \nPRESSBOARD IN FR3  \nThe surface tracking process on a pressboard sample in FR3 is \nshown in Figure 8. The voltage applied was 50.0 kV.  \n30 min               32 min              34 min              37 min              41 min              41.8 min   \n \nFigure 8. Surface tracking process on a pressboard surface in FR3 at 50.0 kV . \nIt can be seen that the surface tracking process on the FR3-\nimpregnated pressboard included similar stages to those \nimpregnated by MIDEL 7131. The discharge pattern also exhibited \nsimilar changes from liquid type discharge, to gas discharge of free \nbubbles, till discharge of constrained bubbles and carbonizations, as \nshown in Figure 9. The white mark also grew fast; it soon bridged \nthe whole gap and caused a flashover. At 50.0 kV, the growing \ntime of the white mark from the inception till bridging the whole \ngap for the three samples were 43, 41 and 71 minutes, respectively.   \n4.4 SURFACE TRACKING PROCESS ON WET \nPRESSBOARDS IN GEMINI X  \nFigure 10 shows an example of the growth of white mark on \nthe surface of a wet pressboard in Gemini X.  \n4992pC\n3744pC\n2496pC\n1248pC\n0pC\n0° 90° 180° 270° 360°\n5424pC\n4068pC\n2712pC\n1356pC\n0pC\n0° 90° 180° 270° 360°\n(a) stage one-liquid type discharges (b) stage two-gas type discharges of free \nbubbles \n1932pC\n1449pC\n966pC\n483pC\n0pC\n0° 90° 180° 270° 360° \n136pC\n102pC\n68pC\n34pC\n0pC\n0° 90° 180° 270° 360°\n(c) stage three-gas type discharges of \nconstrained  bubbles and carbonization \n(d) stage four-weakened gas type \ndischarges of constrained bubbles and \ncarbonization \nFigure 9.

After 60 \nminutes, the white mark only grew to 15 mm, whereas in \nesters white mark has usually bridged the 50 mm gap. The \nwhite mark on the pressboard in mineral oil had fewer \nbranches than those in esters. However, the discharge pattern \nevolution was similar to that in esters, and could be classified \ninto similar stages to those in esters, as shown in Figure 11. \n2476pC\n1857pC\n1238pC\n619pC\n0pC\n0° 90° 180° 270° 360° \n5296pC\n3972pC\n2648pC\n1324pC\n0pC\n0° 90° 180° 270° 360°\n(a) stage one-liquid type discharges (b) stage two-gas type discharges of free \nbubbles \n1500pC\n1125pC\n750pC\n375pC\n0pC\n0° 90° 180° 270° 360° \n124pC  \n93pC\n62pC\n31pC\n0pC\n0° 90° 180° 270° 360°\n(c) stage three-gas type discharges of \nconstrained  bubbles and carbonization \n(d) stage four-weakened gas type \ndischarges of constrained bubbles and \ncarbonization \nFigure 11.

In this test, two pressboards impregnated in MIDEL \n7131 were used to study the surface tracking on the composite \npressboard structure. A pressboard was attached to the needle tip \nand was in a vertical direction (marked as vertical pressboard); \nthe other covered the earthed plane electrode and was in a \nhorizontal direction (marked as pressboard cover).  \nIn preliminary tests, it was found that when the white mark on \nthe vertical pressboard was about to reach the pressboard cover, \nsparks appeared at the bottom edge of the vertical pressboard with \nthe PDs up to several thousand pC and severely damaged the \npressboard cover. By further adding Perspex sheets (total \nthickness of 6 mm) between the pressboard cover and the plane \nelectrode, the spark discharges were avoided.  \nA pressboard sample was tested at 60.0 kV for as long as 124 \nhours. During the surface tracking process, only small bubbles \nwere observed coming out from the tree-shaped mark on the two \npressboards and at the overlapping region between them.  \nIt can be seen from Figure 12 that the white mark could transit \nto light-shadowed mark and finally to the obvious tree-shaped \ncarbonized mark. Meanwhile, the tree-shaped carbonized mark \nwas also seen on the reverse of the vertical pressboard and it also \nextended to the pressboard cover, as shown in Figure 13.  \nThis test verifies that a white mark will develop into \ncarbonized mark when a pressboard is stressed by discharges for \na sufficiently long time and the tree-shaped mark can extend from \none pressboard to another. The carbonized mark is similar to that \nseen on pressboard cylinders in scrapped transformers as shown \nin Figure 1.  \nwhite mark\nafter 1 hour\ncarbonized mark\nafter 60 hours\ncarbonized mark\nafter 124 hours  \nFigure 12.

Carbonized mark on the reverse of the vertical pressboard and on \nthe pressboard cover. \n5 MECHANISMS OF SURFACE TRACKING \nON PRESSBOARD \n5.1 THE GASEOUS NATURE OF WHITE MARK \nA lot of tiny gas bubbles rose from the white mark during its \ngrowth. After the test, the pressboard sample with white mark \nimmersed in the liquid was degassed in a vacuum oven. A large \namount of gas bubbles were extracted from the white mark area \nand the white mark disappeared afterwards. These phenomena \nindicate that the white mark is gaseous channels on and inside the \npressboard. \nThe discharge current signals during the white mark growth are \ncomposed of single pulses with a fast rising edge and short \nsustaining time, like the discharges in gases, which also evidences \nthe discharges in white mark are mainly of a gaseous type.  \nSince the white mark is of gaseous nature, the gas contents in \nthe white mark channels were further identified by DGA analysis.  \nAfter the white mark grew to 15 mm on a pressboard in MIDEL \n7131, the pressboard was taken out of the test vessel and immersed \nin a large beaker filled with fresh MIDEL 7131. The pressboard \nwas cut to obtain the small piece with the white mark. This piece \nwas then put into a syringe filled with fresh MIDEL 7131. This is \nto prevent the pressboard piece with white mark from contacting \nwith air, so no air bubbles can be trapped in the cutting edges. This \nsyringe was then placed into a vacuum oven. During the vacuum \nprocess, small gas bubbles were extracted from the white mark \nareas and formed a headspace over the liquid when the syringe \nvolume expanded. The vacuum was released when no more gas \nbubbles came out. After being taken out of the vacuum oven, about \n3 ml headspace was collected and the headspace gases were \n1632  X. Yi and Z. D. Wang: Surface Trac king on Pressboard in Natural and Synthetic Transformer Liquids under AC Stress \nanalysed by Gas Chromatography. Meanwhile, the MIDEL 7131 \nliquid around the needle tip was also sampled for comparison. The \nDGA results are shown in Figure 14. \nAs can be seen, the components of fault gases in the white \nmark were similar to those generated by PDs in the open gap test \nin [22]; the key gases were H\n2, CO and C2H2, which indicates the \npartial discharge fault in MIDEL 7131 [22]. It is therefore proved \nthat the trapped bubbles in the white mark are related to the \ndecomposition of liquid in the pores between cellulose fibres, due \nto creepage discharges. Meanwhile, the liquid around the needle \ntip above the pressboard also has similar gas components. They \nshould be both from the streamers creeping along the pressboard \nand the free bubbles dispersed from the white mark. \n128\n8 1 5 11\n37\n165\n2 11 9 10\n138\n2 1 2 6 12\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nH2 CH4 C2H6 C2H4 C2H2 CO\nin open gap test** in white mark dissolved in MIDEL 7131 around needle tip\n \nFigure 14.  Gas concentrations (in ppm) in  the white mark, in the liquid \naround needle tip and comparison with open gap test in MIDEL 7131. \n(** note: the results for open gap we re generated under PDs up to 1000 pC, \nfrom [22] ). \n5.2 THE EXTENSION OF WHITE MARK AT A \nREDUCED VOLTAGE \nThe white mark could continue growing at a reduced voltage. \nTaking a test in MIDEL 7131 as an example, 37.0 kV was \napplied to trigger a white mark on the pressboard. Then the \nvoltage was reduced to 30.0 kV at which level the white mark \ncould not be initiated on an intact pressboard; however the white \nmark could keep on growing slowly but steadily at 30.0 kV.   \nUnderstanding this phenomenon is crucial: transformers may \nsometimes suffer from a temporary overvoltage, which might be \nable to induce intense creepage discharges and trigger the \nincipient tree-shaped mark. After the overvoltage, the tree-shaped \nmark might continue to spread on the pressboard under the \nnormal operating voltage. Although this process might be slow, \nthe cumulative growth of the surface tree-shaped mark would also \nbe able to cause catastrophic failure of a transformer.    \n5.3 THE RE-GROWTH OF WHITE MARK AFTER RE-\nIMPREGNATION \nAfter the cellulose fibres are damaged and carbonized along \nthe white mark traces, the carbonized mark will direct the \nsubsequent discharges and further steer the extension of white \nmark. This was evidenced by a white mark re-growing test. As \nshown in Figure 15a, a white mark had grown to 13 mm long on \na pressboard in FR3; then this pressboard was re-impregnated in a \nvacuum. After the re-impregnation, the white mark disappeared \nand the carbonized mark became more obvious as shown in \nFigure 15b. Afterwards, a 50.0 kV voltage was re-applied to this \nsample, and it was found that the white mark could re-grow on \nthe pressboard surface, with the branches extending based on the \nprevious channels, as shown in Figure 15c.  \nWhite mark is gaseous pockets caged among cellulose fibres. \nAfter re-impregnation, the trapped gas pockets were degassed and \nre-filled by the insulating liquid; therefore, the white mark would \ndisappear under vacuum. However, along the white mark, the \ncarbonized fibres remained, even after the gaseous pockets in the \nform of white mark were degassed by the vacuum. These \ncarbonized channels would steer the subsequent discharges and \nthe upcoming white mark would follow the existing traces and \nextend further.  \n(a) with white mark (b) re‐impregnated (c) white mark re‐grow\n \nFigure 15. The re-growth of the white mark after re-impregnation. \n5.4 THE PENETRATION OF TREE-SHAPED MARK \nINTO THE PRESSBOARD \nThe white mark newly initiated is very shallow and only exist \non the surface when they have not been carbonized yet. In this \ncase, when the voltage is stopped, the white mark would be re-\nimpregnated by the insulating liquid and disappear. \nHowever, the white mark will gradually penetrate into the \ninner layers. For the tests on the wet pressboards in Gemini X at \n50.0 kV, the white mark penetrated so deep into the pressboard \nthat they could be seen on the reverse of the pressboard and some \nsmall bubbles were observed from the reverse, as shown in Figure \n16. This proves that white mark is an object of three dimensions \nwith length and width as well as depth, rather than two \ndimensions only spreading on the surface.    \n50 mm\nWhite mark at \nthe back side\nBubble string from\nthe back side\nNeedle electrode\n \nFigure 16.  White mark and bubbles appearing on the reverse of a wet \npressboard in Gemini X. \nCarbonized mark can also develop deep inside the pressboard. \nAs an example, a test on a composite pressboard structure in \nMIDEL 7131 lasted for 3 hours at 43.0 kV and 6 hours at 55.0 kV. \nDuring the test, a hole developed around the needle tip and a \n10 mm tree-shaped carbonized mark could be seen on the \npressboard surface, as shown in Figure 17. Afterwards, this \npressboard was cut into 10 strips and peeled into different layers \nfor further observations.  \nIEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation    Vol. 20, No. 5; October 2013 1633  \nFigure 18 shows the carbonized mark inside the pressboard. \nThe carbonized mark had spanned the whole pressboard, \nalthough the traces on the surface were merely 10 mm. The \ncarbonized mark could go deeper and deeper during the \ngrowth. Those channels underneath the surface layer are more \nsusceptive to the carbonization under the cumulative discharge \nerosion. The gas bubbles formed in the surface layer can easily \nescape from the cellulose fibres into the liquid. However, the \ngas pockets in the inner layers would be trapped by the \ncellulose fibres, so the gaseous channels are conserved and \nmore discharges would follow these channels. Given sufficient \nstressing time, the inner carbon ized traces can grow thicker \nand darker so that the tree-shaped carbonized mark can be \nobserved on the pressboard surface and even on the reverse \nsurface, as shown in Figures 12 and 13. \n    \n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nposition of the\nneedle electrode\n \nFigure 17.

Tree-shaped carbonized mark inside  the layers of the vertical \npressboard stressed for 3 hours at 43.0  kV and 6 hours at 55.0 kV in MIDEL \n7131. \n6 DISCUSSIONS \n6.1 TRACKING ON PRESSBOARD IN \nTRANSFORMERS  \nIn scrapped transformers, although only the black carbonized \nmark was observed, it is reasonable to believe that there were \npreceding white mark occurrence. Before scrapped, the \ntransformers had usually been stopped operating for some time \nand the insulating liquid had been drained. During this period, \npressboard barriers were exposed to the ambient environment, \nand the white mark could have vanished. \nAs shown in the tests, stressed by the creepage discharge \nenergy, the insulating liquid and the moisture in the pressboard \nsurface layers would evaporate and decompose into gases. Some \nof the generated gases are trapped between cellulose fibres due to \nthe viscosity of surrounding insulating liquid and this changes the \nlocal light reflection index on the pressboard; therefore, these \nareas turn into a white mark.  \nDue to the gaseous nature, the white mark is the easy site for \ndischarges, so the subsequent discharges are attracted to this area. \nThe cumulative discharges along the same paths carbonize these \nchannels. The carbonized mark can steer the subsequent \ndischarges and expand with more branches until it bridges the gap \nand causes a final flashover. High energy is required for cellulose \ncarbonization and the local temperature should be above 280 °C \n[23]. However, the high energy is not registered as large PD \namplitudes. The apparent charges accompanied by the tracking \nprocess are usually small, even lower than the background noise \nlevels in the substations. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the \ninternal tracking fault by conventional PD monitoring.  \n6.2 COMPARISONS BETWEEN ESTERS AND \nMINERAL OIL \nAs summarized in Table 1, white mark could be easily initiated \non dry pressboards in esters at a relatively low voltage; whereas \nin mineral oil, white mark can only be induced on sufficiently wet \npressboards. The white mark extends much faster with more and \nlonger branches on pressboards in esters than in mineral oil. Also, \nthe white mark is easier to be carbonized and transit to carbonized \nmark on the pressboards in esters.  \nTable 1. Comparisons of surface tracking in the three liquids. \n MIDEL 7131 FR3 mineral oil \nmoisture content <0.5% <0.5% 4.3% <3.5% \ntracking inception \nappear \nfrom \n37 kV \nappear \nfrom \n47 kV \nexist at  \n50 kV \nnone \nup to \n52 kV \ntracking \ngrowth \nlength bridging the 50 mm \ngap in 60 min \nless than 15 \nmm in 60 min \nN/A size \nmany branches forming \na tree shape spreading \non the pressboard \na short main \ntrunk with \nsubtle side \nbranches \ndepth only seen on the front \nsurface \nalso observed \non the reverse \nUnder the same voltage, the discharges in esters are more \nintense than in mineral oil, with greater PD amplitude and higher \nPD repetition rate; besides this, the high viscosity of esters [18] \nwould more readily trap the gas bubbles than mineral oil within \nthe cellulose texture. This explains why pressboards impregnated \nby esters are more susceptive to surface tracking erosion.  \nFor the mineral-oil-impregnated pressboard, high moisture is a \nnecessity to initiate the surface tracking; therefore, much energy \nis consumed by the evaporation of moisture all around the needle \ntip, including the bulk of the pressboard. In addition, due to the \nlower viscosity of mineral oil, the generated vapour can migrate \n1634  X. Yi and Z. D. Wang: Surface Trac king on Pressboard in Natural and Synthetic Transformer Liquids under AC Stress \nmore easily between the fibres, and from the pressboard to \nsurrounding liquid. Therefore, the white mark can penetrate all \nthrough the depth of pressboard and have fewer branches and \nslower growing speed for pressboards in mineral oil than in esters. \n7 CONCLUSIONS \nBased on the experimental investigations on the tracking on \npressboard and the accompanying discharge patterns, it can be \nconcluded that a liquid-impregnated pressboard is susceptive to \ndischarge erosion characterized by white mark and carbonized \nmark, due to the intense discharges on and inside the pressboard.  \nThe trapped gaseous channels from the liquid decomposition \ntake the form of white mark on the surface layers of the \npressboard. As the easiest cha nnel for discharges, the gaseous \nwhite mark will attract the subsequent discharges; the \naccumulative energy dissipation will carbonize the channels. \nOnce formed, the tree-shaped mark can continue to grow even \nunder reduced voltage levels until it bridges the gap and finally \ncauses a flashover.  \nThe comparative study between esters and mineral oil suggests \nthat, for ester-impregnated pressboards, the white mark would \nappear at a lower voltage, expand and transit to carbonized mark \nmore easily. This is due to more intense discharges and more gas \ngeneration as well as the higher viscosity of esters than mineral \noil. Consequently, attention should be paid to the weaker \nresistance of ester-impregnated pressboards to surface tracking \nwhen applying esters in large power transformers. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe authors would like to thank ALSTOM Grid, M&I \nMaterials, National Grid, Sco ttish Power, TJ|H2b Analytical \nServices and UK Power Networks for the financial and technical \nsupports to the research consortium on ‘Application of \nAlternative Oils for Large Power Transformers’ at the University \nof Manchester.
