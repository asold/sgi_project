Modern life involves the\nuse of a wide variety of manmade items, from ceramic kitchen scissors to smartphones. We\ncan recognize familiar tools at once and perform the proper action for each of them with\nease. How the human brain implements this ability still remains to be fully explained. At\nleast two cognitive components seem involved: recognition of the tool’s function and correct\nmanipulation. To purposefully use a particular tool, one should be able to correctly identify its\nfunction and retrieve how to manipulate it. These two components (recognition of tool function\nand memory of manipulation) may be underpinned by separable brain regions. The earliest\nreports supporting this argument come from neuropsychology. Here, tool-use deficits have\nbeen observed after damage of the left parietal lobe, often described with the term ‘‘apraxia’’,\nespecially as ‘‘ideational apraxia’’ (Heilman and Rothi, 1993) or ‘‘conceptual apraxia’’ (Ochipa\net al., 1992; Zadikoff and Lang, 2005). Patients with apraxia manifest difficulty in using objects\nproperly, despite preserved physical function of the limbs (Gonzalez Rothi and Heilman, 1997).\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 1 January 2018 | Volume 11 | Article 37\nIshibashi et al. Non-invasive Brain Stimulation and Tool Semantics\nInvestigations revealed that patients with ideational/conceptual\napraxia have compromised knowledge of how to move their\nbody parts to use familiar tools due to infarction at/around\nleft inferior parietal lobule (IPL) after stroke (Buxbaum et al.,\n2000; Buxbaum and Saffran, 2002; Rosci et al., 2003). Similarly,\nGainotti (2000, 2004) has suggested that lesions in left fronto-\nparietal and sensory cortices lead to category–specific deficits in\nthe representation of tools and other manmade items.\nWhile these studies on apraxia report deficits in knowledge\nof tool-use actions, studies of semantic dementia (SD) have\nreported deficits in knowledge about tool function. Patients\nwith SD suffer from symptoms reflecting degraded conceptual\nknowledge of objects. This is believed to result from progressive\ndegeneration of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Studies\nsuggest that the severity of their semantic deficit correlates\nwith the extent of atrophy in bilateral ATLs (Mummery et al.,\n2000; Nestor et al., 2006). Neuropsychological investigations\nof verbal/non-verbal cognitive function in patients with SD\nrevealed that they have compromised knowledge of how to use\nfamiliar objects in purposeful ways (Bozeat et al., 2000, 2002).\nIn a longitudinal study of two SD cases over 4 years, Coccia\net al. (2004) also showed a parallel decline in general semantics\nand object-use ability. This indicates that the tool-use deficit\nin SD patients stems from their compromised comprehension\nof tools themselves, including in which context a tool should\nbe used. These studies on SD indicate that general semantic\nknowledge, including the function of each object, contributes to\ndaily object-use ability and that the semantic comprehension of\nobjects most likely is supported by the ATLs in both hemispheres.\nSeveral neuroimaging studies with healthy participants\nreported distinctive activations associated with object function\nand action in the ATL and IPL regions, respectively. Kellenbach\net al. (2003) used positron emission tomography (PET) to\nexplore object-related cortical regions associated with function\nor action of familiar tools. Following visual presentation of a\nfamiliar tool, participants answered one of various questions\nthat tapped into their knowledge of the tool’s function (e.g., ‘‘Is\nthe object used to attach or hold objects together?’’) or action\n(e.g., ‘‘Does using the object involve a back-and-forth action?’’).\nKellenbach et al. (2003) found increased activation in a region\naround the left IPL (with a peak at the intraparietal sulcus)\nwhen the participants were making decisions about actions\nwith objects. Boronat et al. (2005) found a similar activation\nin the left parietal lobe using functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI). Their task involved presentation of object pairs\nthat could have the same function (e.g., matches and lighter)\nor action (e.g., piano and computer keyboard). Participants\nwere asked to judge if the pair had a semantic association\nin terms of function or action. Comparison of the two task\nconditions revealed higher activation in the left IPL for action-\nmatching relative to function-matching. A similar task was used\nby Canessa et al. (2008). They reported contrasting activations\nin IPL and inferior temporal cortex in the left hemisphere. In\ntheir object matching task, participants judged the semantic\nrelevance of object pairs based on the context of object use\n(used in the kitchen, gardening, etc.), as well as the physical\naction employed to use the tool. The data revealed significantly\nhigher activation in the left IPL for action than for context\njudgment. In the left posterior middle temporal gyrus there\nwas higher activation for context than for action judgment.\nThis implies dissociable roles of the left IPL and the temporal\nlobe.\nEvidence for involvement of IPL and ATL regions is\nfurther supported by recent studies using non-invasive brain\nstimulation. Pobric et al. (2010) applied 1-Hz repetitive\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to inhibit focal cortical\nactivities in the left ATL/IPL in healthy participants before\nasking them to perform object naming. Results showed slightly\ndelayed responses for manipulable items after rTMS to IPL,\nwhile ATL stimulation slowed naming of all types of concepts\nincluding living and non-living items. In our previous study\n(Ishibashi et al., 2011), we used the same rTMS-protocol as\nPobric et al. (2010) to examine the roles of left ATL and IPL in\ntool cognition. In the study, we asked participants to perform a\ntool-matching task based on the tool’s function or manipulation\n(action). Object pairs with similar actions (e.g., scissors and\npliers) had to be chosen in the manipulation judgment task,\nwhile pairs with similar functions (e.g., scissors and knife) were\nto be selected in the function judgment task. The results showed\nincreased response times (RT) for function matching after rTMS\non ATL, as well as increased RT for manipulation matching\nafter rTMS on IPL. A similar dissociation between temporal\nand parietal lobes was observed by Andres et al. (2013) with\ntasks requiring recall of various contexts of using particular\ntools or of the hand configuration in using them. They found\nslower RT in the hand configuration task after rTMS on the left\nSMG (the rostral part of IPL). These results indicate separable\ncognitive processing in IPL and ATL by demonstrating the causal\nrelationship between magnetic stimulation and the performance\nof cognitive tasks.\nThough the above findings with rTMS demonstrate crucial\nroles for the ATL and IPL regions in tool recognition and\nuse, it is still unclear whether human tool cognition can be\nimproved by some intervention into these two areas using\nnon-invasive brain stimulation. The rTMS protocol described\nabove is effective to induce transient reduction of activity in\na particular region of the brain (Walsh and Rushworth, 1999).\nA more practical question would be whether increasing the\nactivity in these areas improves tool cognition performance.\nAnswering this question should be of great interest to clinicians\nand caregivers of patients suffering from major deficits in daily\ntool-use ability. Testing this possibility requires another method\nof non-invasive stimulation that is capable of up-modulating the\ncortical activity of an area: transcranial direct current stimulation\n(tDCS). This method uses a weak (1–2 mA) direct current on\nparticular cerebral areas of interest. Applying continuous current\nto the brain through the skull modulates the membrane potential\nof neurons under the electrodes in a polarity-dependent way\n(Nitsche and Paulus, 2000, 2011). Anodal stimulation depolarizes\nthe membrane potential, thus resulting in an increased firing\nrate in the area, while cathodal stimulation hyperpolarizes it,\nleading to a decreased firing rate. Therefore, the application\nof electrical currents could influence cortical excitability and\naffect behavior (Bestmann et al., 2015). Some attempts have been\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 2 January 2018 | Volume 11 | Article 37\nIshibashi et al. Non-invasive Brain Stimulation and Tool Semantics\nalready made to explore its application in alleviating cognitive\ndeficits after stroke (Pollock et al., 2014) or progressive neuro-\ndegenerative disorders (Hung et al., 2017). Based on these\npromising reports, we explored the potential facilitative effect of\nanodal tDCS in healthy volunteers. Following on from previous\nfindings, we focused on the question whether stimulating the\nleft ATL or IPL improves recognition of tool function/action. In\nline with previous studies (Pobric et al., 2010; Ishibashi et al.,\n2011), we expected to observe a modality-general facilitation\neffect by ATL-tDCS and an action-specific facilitation effect by\nIPL-tDCS.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nParticipants\nEighteen students from Kyoto University (21–27 years old,\nmean age = 22.3, 13 males) took part in this study. All had\nnormal or corrected-to-normal vision. This study was approved\nby the Ethics Committee at the Graduate School and Faculty\nof Medicine, Kyoto University (reference code: C800). All\nparticipants provided written consent before starting the study\nin accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nStimuli\nThe stimuli were based on tasks from clinical investigations of\ntool use knowledge in SD patients (Hodges et al., 2000; Bozeat\net al., 2002; Corbett et al., 2009). Two-hundred tool images\ncollected from the internet were used. The tools were organized\ninto 90 sets of four images by sampling with replacement. Thirty-\nthree items were used for 10 practice trials and the remaining\n167 items were used to compose 80 trials for real testing. Each\ntrial (see Figure 1 ) consisted of a probe object (e.g., scissors),\na function target that had the same/similar function as the\nprobe (e.g., guillotine), a manipulation target that is manipulated\nin the same/similar ways as the probe (e.g., pliers) and a foil\n(e.g., whisk).\nTask\nWe developed two tasks to tap into knowledge of either tool\nfunction or tool manipulation. The same stimulus set was used\nin both function and manipulation tasks. Each trial consisted\nof the presentation of four photos of tools (seeFigure 1 ) for\nup to 1500 ms following a 1000 ms presentation of a fixation\ncross. The probe object (e.g., scissors) was presented above\nthe other three. In the function matching task, participants\nwere asked to choose the tool from the three objects with the\nsame/similar function as the probe (e.g., guillotine, for cutting).\nIn the manipulation matching task, they were asked to choose\nthe tool with the same/similar way of manipulation (e.g., pliers,\nby gripping handles with one hand). Ten trials were chosen\nbeforehand for practice. After two cycles of practice trials for each\ntask, the participants performed 160 trials in total (80 for each\ntask). There was a self-paced rest after every 40 trials. The order\nof tasks was counterbalanced across participants. Participants\npressed the left-, down-, or right-arrow keys on the keyboard,\ncorresponding to the choice of an object at left, middle, or right.\nStimuli were presented until response for a maximum of 1500 ms.\nFIGURE 1 |Stimulus presentation in the two cognitive tasks.\nA 1000 ms blank screen was inserted before starting the next\ntrial. The time limit of 1500 ms was introduced to produce\nenough cognitive load for the young, healthy participants and\nincrease task difficulty. E-prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools\nInc.) running on a laptop PC was used for stimulus presentation\nand recording of participants’ responses.\nProcedure\nWe employed a within participant design. Participants took\npart in three sessions on separate days with at least a\n5-day interval between them. In each session a different\nbrain region was stimulated: left ATL, left IPL and sham in\ncounterbalanced order. A 3 × 3 cm anodal electrode was\nput over position FT7 (according to the international 10-10\nEEG system) for ATL stimulation, or CP3 for IPL stimulation,\nand a 5 × 5 cm cathodal electrode (reference) was placed\non the right of the forehead (1 cm below FP2). The site of\nsham stimulation was randomly chosen. Half of the participants\nreceived sham stimulation over left ATL; the other half over\nleft IPL. The sponge electrodes were soaked with saline prior to\neach session to increase electrical conductance. A NeuroConn\nDC Stimulator Plus (NeuroCare Inc.) delivered the direct\ncurrent stimulation. Duration of stimulation was synchronized\nwith task duration (avg = 17.8 min). Stimulation intensity\nwas set initially at 2.0 mA. If the participant perceived the\nstimulation as uncomfortable, the current was lowered by\nsteps of 0.1 mA. To ensure that participants were familiar\nwith the stimuli, all 167 pictures of tools and their names\nwere presented for 1000 ms each. Subsequently, participants\nwent through a practice block that contained 10 trials for\neach task. After practice, the DC stimulation was initiated.\nStimulation was set to reach the designated current with an\n8 s ramp-up period and 8 s ramp-down period. In the sham\nstimulation condition, the electric current lasted 30 s. Four\nblocks of 40 trials were administered, counterbalanced by task\n(tool function/manipulation). Participants took self-paced rests\nbetween the blocks. Using these tDCS parameters, we modeled\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 3 January 2018 | Volume 11 | Article 37\nIshibashi et al. Non-invasive Brain Stimulation and Tool Semantics\nFIGURE 2 |Model of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) current. Red-yellow colors indicate increased magnitude of the total electric ﬁeld due to tDCS. Left\npanel displays left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) stimulation, while the right panel highlights stimulation within the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL).\nthe magnitude of the total electric field due to stimulation with\nCOMETS (Jung et al., 2013). The model provided evidence that\nthe tDCS electric field was largest in the left ventral ATL and left\nIPL (please seeFigure 2).\nRESULTS\nAs five participants reported an uncomfortable tingling feeling\non electrodes during the initial phase of stimulation, the level\nof stimulation was downregulated by steps of 0.1 mA in 8 of\n54 sessions. The average current intensity across all participants\nremained at 1.9 mA.\nSince the experiment was designed to examine accuracy data\nin each task within the imposed limited time for each trial\n(1500 ms), we did not put a major effort into analyzing RT.\nMean RT in each condition was calculated and almost the\nsame across all conditions (1123–1145 ms). Accuracy data were\nencoded binomially (success = 1, failure = 0) for use in the\nanalyses. Mean accuracy in each task/tDCS condition is shown\nin Figure 3. Compared to sham stimulation, participants showed\nbetter performance with ATL stimulation in the function task.\nIn the manipulation task, performance was better in both the\nATL and the IPL stimulation condition compared to sham. We\nconducted a series of logistic mixed-effect model analyses using\nthe lme4 package in R1. Linear mixed effects models account\nfor within subject correlations more optimally than Analysis of\nVariance (ANOVA). In order to estimate the effects of tDCS, the\nsham condition was used as a reference level in the regression,\nwhich allowed estimating regression coefficients for ATL and IPL\nstimulation. The order of the sessions (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) was also\nincluded to control for the effect of participants’ adaptation to\nthe tasks. First, we conducted an analysis including all possible\nmain effects and interactions. The involved fixed effects were\ntask (function/manipulation), stimulation (ATL, IPL, sham),\nsession order (1st, 2nd or 3rd). The random effects were\nparticipant and trial. Interaction between task and stimulation\n1https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html\nFIGURE 3 |Accuracy in sham, ATL and IPL conditions. Error bars indicate\nstandard error.\nwas also included in the model as a fixed-effect term. The results\nshowed a significant main effect of ATL stimulation (z = 2.35,\np < 0.05), but no significant effect of IPL stimulation (z = 0.71,\np > 0.10). Interaction effects between task and stimulation\nwere not significant (z = −0.11 in ATL andz = 0.939 in IPL,\np > 0.10), nor were the interactions between session order and\ntask (z < 1.38, p > 0.10).\nBased on our own previous neurostimulation studies (Pobric\net al., 2010; Ishibashi et al., 2011) and extensive literature\n(Buxbaum et al., 2000; Buxbaum and Saffran, 2002; Rosci et al.,\n2003), we had a strong expectation to find an interaction\nbetween stimulation and task. We therefore, explored the effects\nof tDCS on ATL and IPL in the two tasks separately. This\ntask-wise mixed-effect model analyses found significant effects\nof ATL stimulation in both function and manipulation tasks\n(z = 2.35 and 2.25 respectively,p < 0.05). The effect of IPL\nstimulation was significant for the manipulation task (z = 2.08,\np < 0.05), but not for the function task (z = 0.73, p > 0.10).\nEstimated beta values for ATL and IPL in each task are shown in\nFigure 4. This exploratory analysis suggests that an interaction\nbetween task and stimulation site may exist, since the beta values\nconform to the expected pattern.\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 4 January 2018 | Volume 11 | Article 37\nIshibashi et al. Non-invasive Brain Stimulation and Tool Semantics\nFIGURE 4 |Estimated regression coefﬁcient values for the tDCS effect\n(ATL/IPL vs. sham). Error bars indicate estimated standard deviation.\n∗Indicates statistically signiﬁcant deviation from zero (p < 0.05).\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we found an enhancing effect of tDCS\napplied over the left ATL in semantic tasks requiring knowledge\nof function or action of familiar tools. The effect of ATL\nstimulation was task-general (both manipulation and action\nmatching). Our exploratory analysis revealed that there may be a\ntask-specific effect of IPL stimulation for the manipulation task.\nThe trend towards a task-dependent pattern of the stimulation\neffect partially corresponds with our previous rTMS study\n(Ishibashi et al., 2011), in which we showed an effect of\nATL stimulation in a tool function task and an effect of IPL\nstimulation in an action-judgment task. Our current study\ndemonstrates effects of anodal tDCS on retrieving the semantic\ninformation necessary for human tool use. The task-invariant\nfacilitation by anodal ATL-tDCS is particularly important when\nconsidering the potential outcome of applying non-invasive\nstimulation to this region. The left and right ATLs have been\ndiscussed in association with modality-general processing of\nvarious concepts. Neuropsychological investigations of patients\nwith SD provide converging evidence for the importance of\nthese regions for semantic cognition in various contexts, such\nas comprehension of speech or written words or naming\npictures of familiar items (Jefferies and Lambon Ralph, 2006;\nCrutch and Warrington, 2008). The focal atrophy in these\nregions is believed to cause deterioration in the patients’ ability\nto deal with the environment in a meaningful way. While\ndysfunction in a verbal-linguistic context, such as difficulty\nin word comprehension and anomia, is prominent in SD\npatients, non-verbal semantic impairments including tool-use\ndeficit were also reported in the last few decades. The ability\nof SD patients to use familiar objects was investigated by\nHodges et al. (2000). They found that patients with SD indeed\nperformed below the normal range in tool recognition/use.\nImportantly, performance was commensurate with the degree\nof degradation in semantics measured with picture naming, a\ncategory fluency test, word-picture matching and the Pyramid\nand Palm Trees Test (Howard and Patterson, 1992). In addition,\nthere was a strong by-item correlation between tool-naming\nand tool-use scores, which indicates item-by-item consistency\nin performance (i.e., inability to name/recognize a tool is\naccompanied by an inability to use it). This parallelism of\nconceptual knowledge and action knowledge about tools is\nalso indicated by a longitudinal study of SD patients by\nCoccia et al. (2004). Assessments of the verbal and non-verbal\nsemantic competency of two SD cases over 4 years, found that\ntool-use ability declined in parallel with the degradation of\nthe patients’ general semantics. Other studies also report an\nassociation between semantic memory and tool-use ability in SD\n(Hamanaka et al., 1996; Hodges et al., 1999). Taken together,\nthese reports suggest that ATL supports general object semantics\nand hence that damage to this area can lead to degraded\nability of both understanding and making use of common tools.\nThe current finding of enhanced tool cognition by facilitative\nelectrical stimulation over ATL does not only corroborate\nthis view, but also identifies the possibility of modulating the\nactivity of the ‘‘semantic hub’’ to improve recognition and\nuse of common tools, an ability essential in modern human\nlife.\nThe increased accuracy in our tool judgment task during\nATL-tDCS is also in line with our own previous findings. Pobric\net al. (2010) reported category-invariant slowing of naming by\napplying rTMS to ATL, while IPL stimulation yielded effects\nselectively for manipulable, non-living items only, demonstrating\nthe generality of the ATL contribution to object naming. The\ntask-general effect of ATL stimulation is essentially the same\nin the current experiment. Our previous TMS study with\nthe same type of tasks (Ishibashi et al., 2011) showed that\nfunction knowledge about tools are temporarily hampered by\nrepetitive TMS on the left ATL, which indicated the role of\nthis region in representing object functions. The rTMS study,\nhowever, did not find an effect of ATL stimulation on tool-action\njudgments. One explanation of this apparent discrepancy is\nthat the difficulty of tool action judgments was much higher\nin this study, due to the imposed time limit. The task was\ndesigned to be difficult enough for healthy participants to\nmake sufficient errors when forced to respond in a short\ntime. Due to the tight time restrictions in the current study\nthe mean accuracy without DC stimulation was about 0.60,\nproviding a sufficient margin for improvement. Although it is\nnot reasonable to compare RT and accuracy measures across\ndifferent experiments, the sensitivity of the current tasks to\nimprovement may have been a major factor contributing to the\ndifference between these stimulation studies. The present results\nsuggest that the accuracy of tasks in relatively difficult setting,\ncombined with a sensible statistical method, can provide an\nappropriate measure to test the effect of the transcranial DC\nstimulation.\nThe current results also suggest at a possible contribution\nof the IPL region to judging the manipulation of familiar\nobjects. The task-wise GLMM analyses suggested that the effect\nof IPL stimulation was much larger for the manipulation-\nthan for function-judgment task. The direction of this result\nagrees with the semantic hub and spoke model. Judging\nmanipulation is arguably more directly linked to representations\nof body movement and thus should be more modality-\nspecific than function attributes. In fact, as discussed in the\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 5 January 2018 | Volume 11 | Article 37\nIshibashi et al. Non-invasive Brain Stimulation and Tool Semantics\n‘‘Introduction’’ section, stroke patients with infarction in the left\nparietal cortex often manifest symptoms of ideational apraxia,\na neuropsychological condition characterized by an inability\nto manipulate familiar objects in proper ways. Furthermore,\nsome seminal work on post-stroke cognitive deficits report that\npatients with the left parietal damage show category-specific\nsemantic impairment for tools. Warrington and McCarthy\n(1983, 1987) reported several patients with left temporo-parietal\nor fronto-parietal infarction whose recognition of manmade\nobjects was selectively impaired while sparing the ability to\nrecognize animals. Gainotti (2000) reviewed reports of 47\npost-stroke patients and concluded that damage in the dorso-\nlateral regions of the left hemisphere (ranging from temporo-\nparietal to frontal areas) leads to category-specific semantic\nimpairment for manmade artifacts. This notion is strengthened\nby another meta-analysis by the same author (Gainotti, 2004)\nwhich showed that patients with focal damage in temporal\nlobes (with spared fronto-parietal cortex) are generally better\nin recognizing artifacts than living things. This line of focused\ninvestigations on the correlation between the pattern of brain\ndamage and category specificity in semantic deficits supports\nthe contention that a part in the left parietal lobe contributes to\ncomposing the core information of the manipulable, manmade\nobjects. A candidate for this role is the IPL, due to its location\non the course of occipital-visual to frontal-motor areas (Zhang\nand Li, 2014). According to a recent theory about multiple visual\npathways to process object information (Buxbaum and Kalénine,\n2010), IPL is well located at the end of a cortical pathway (ventro-\ndorsal pathway) that contributes to retrieving well-learned\nmanipulative actions to use various common objects, such as\nmovement of arm, wrist and fingers. The implied gradation of\nthe tDCS effect favoring the manipulation over the function task\nis in line with this hypothesis.\nA possible alternative account for the role of IPL, however,\nwould be that this area computes tool-body interaction anew\nrather than that it represents and stores information about\ntool-use actions. In fact, the parietal lobe in general has\nlong been argued to convert visual information into motor\nrepresentations to allow body movements towards tools (Mühlau\net al., 2005; Molenberghs et al., 2009). A voxel-based lesion-\nsymptom mapping (VLSM) study with 34 patients with a\ncerebrovascular accident in the left hemisphere (Goldenberg and\nSpatt, 2009) found that damage in the left parietal lobe correlated\nmore with performance in novel object use than in familiar\ntool use. However, considering how heterogeneous the overall\nfunctions of IPL are, it is possible that the areas for representation\nand computation of object-use actions are close yet separable. In\nfact, in the VLSM study by Goldenberg and Spatt (2009), the area\nwith the highest rate of overlapping lesion voxels associated with\nnovel-tool actions was located in a part of IPS, posterior to the\nSMG/BA40 region targeted for stimulation in the current study.\nThis area was also reported in other neuroimaging reports that\ntrained the use of novel tools. Weisberg et al. (2007) had healthy\nvolunteers learn to use 16 novel objects that did not have any\nresemblance to common tools. They found that a part of the\nleft IPS showed higher activation after three training sessions\n(amounting to 4.5 h) of learning proper use of the novel objects.\nSimilar results were found in other studies that trained novel tool\nuse by observation of the manipulation of items (Bellebaum et al.,\n2013; Rüther et al., 2014). Arguably, novel repertoires of tool-use\nactions are computed in an area around posterior IPS and later\ntransferred into SMG for long-term storage. How the novel set of\nactions for unfamiliar tools are created and later consolidated in\ndifferent IPL subregions is still to be elucidated.\nThe positive outcome of anodal tDCS for cognitive processes\nrelated to tools is potentially of great importance for practical\napplications. At present, the application of tDCS as an auxiliary\nmethod for treatment after stroke has already shown some\npositive effects for the motor function of upper limbs (Pollock\net al., 2014; see Lüdemann-Podubecká et al., 2014 for a review\nand lower limbs (van Asseldonk and Boonstra, 2016). Psychiatric\ndisorders such as schizophrenia and depression are also major\ntargets of tDCS interventions (Mondino et al., 2014; Pondé\net al., 2017). Cognitive-linguistic impairments such as stroke\naphasia are also becoming a potential target (Baker et al.,\n2010; Marangolo et al., 2016; see ALHarbi et al., 2017 for a\nreview). However, there are still only a few reports of tDCS\neffects on recovery from apraxic symptoms (Bianchi et al., 2015;\nBolognini et al., 2015). These reports focused on production\nof gestures but not on transitive tool-use actions. In light of\nthe present finding that indicates a possible enhancing effect of\ntDCS for tool-use knowledge, this line of research with patients\nis worth pursuing. As to the general semantic deficits caused\nby SD, anodal tDCS of the temporo-parietal cortex (P3 in the\ninternational 10-10 system) combined with cognitive therapy has\nbeen proven to slow down the progress of symptoms, at least for\nwords trained during stimulation (Hung et al., 2017). Testing of\nhealthy volunteers with semantic tasks has accumulated evidence\nof the effect of tDCS on various regions in the brain (for a\nreview, see Joyal and Fecteau, 2016). The majority of studies with\ntDCS aiming to modulate semantic cognition stimulated frontal\nareas, but essentially no tDCS study so far focused specifically on\nthe anterior part of the temporal lobe (but see Penolazzi et al.,\n2013 for a montage-dependent improvement of word fluency\nby stimulation of the fronto-temporal area). As this region\nis frequently mentioned as the central neural circuit to bind\nsensori-motor information to create semantic representations,\nthe possible enhancing effect of tDCS may deserve further\ninvestigation in future studies.\nIt should be noted that this research had some limitations.\nThe exact mechanism of tDCS is still not known (Bestmann\net al., 2015). As any information should be represented as a\n‘‘pattern’’ of cortical activation in a particular region/multiple\nareas distributed in the brain, it is possible that only the\nrepresentations that could benefit from heightened activations in\nATL/IPL were enhanced in the current experiment. This could\nbe also one of the reasons for the relatively weak effect of tDCS\nwhich in the present study led to the lack of conclusive evidence\nfor task specific IPL stimulation.\nCONCLUSION\nWe report that anodal tDCS on ATL/IPL improves\ncognitive function associated with familiar objects.
