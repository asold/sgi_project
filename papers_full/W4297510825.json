    "abstract": "Automatically predicting and understanding human emotional reactions have wide applications in human-computer interaction. In this paper, we present our solutions to the MuSe-Reaction sub-challenge in MuSe 2022. The task of this sub-challenge is to predict the intensity of 7 emotional expressions from human reactions to a wide range of emotionally evocative stimuli. Specifically, we design an end-to-end model, which is composed of a Spatio-Temporal Transformer for dynamic facial representation learning and a multi-label graph convolutional network for emotion dependency modeling.We also explore the effects of a temporal model with a variety of features from acoustic and visual modalities. Our proposed method achieves mean Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.3375 on the test set of MuSe-Reaction, which outperforms the baseline system(i.e., 0.2801) by a large margin.",
