This\nmethod has been successfully applied in several species, including\nprimates [3,6,7]. One particularly relevant example was the social\nspread of a novel foraging technique, lobtail feeding, in humpback\nwhales ( Megaptera novaeangliae ), detected through Network-\nBased Diffusion Analysis (NBDA) [8]. The NBDA technique tests\nwhether or not a novel behavior spreads along a social network, as\nwould be expected if social transmission were involved [2,8].\nAlthough powerful, one important limitation of NBDA as it has\nbeen used so far in animal behavior studies is that it treats social\nnetworks as static. Static networks based directly on observations\nof the target behavior do not have a time dimension and so do not\ntake into account the fact that an observation event can only\ninfluence the subsequent, and not the previous, rate of learning of\nthe novel behavior (see Materials and Methods for an example). In\ncontrast, if observation conditions allow for documentation of\nindividuals that have witnessed specific events of the target\nbehavior, then a dynamic network can be used. Dynamic networks\nchange to reflect the time course of the observations and are\ntherefore more powerful than static networks, by tracing which\nindividuals are likely to have observed the novel behavior across\ntime.\nHere, we developed a novel version of NBDA that relies on\ninstances of actual demonstrations of the novel behavior across\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 1 September 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 9 | e1001960\n\ntime, rather than employing patterns of association as a proxy for\ndemonstrations. We applied this method to two novel tool-use\nbehaviors that appeared in the Sonso chimpanzee community of\nthe Budongo Forest, Uganda (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). Our\nfindings allowed us to directly address one persistent criticism\nfaced by the hypothesis that chimpanzee behavioral diversity\nshould be interpreted as cultural: the lack of direct evidence for\nsocial transmission of novel behaviors in the wild [9].\nClaims of culture in animals are usually based on excluding\ngenetic or ecological explanations for group-specific behavioral\nvariation, the ‘‘exclusion method’’ [10–15]. Although widely used\nin animal behavior research, this method is vulnerable to\ncounterarguments that seek to explain behavioral variation by\ngenetic factors or with the local ecology [16]. Chimpanzees play a\nkey role in this literature [10], with substantial indirect evidence\nfor social transmission of behavioral innovations [17–21]. A good\nillustration is the presence or absence of nut-cracking in East and\nWest African populations and in some neighbouring West African\ngroups [22]. Studies in the wild have also found that the\nenvironment does play an important role in explaining some\ndifferences, notably by triggering behavioral innovation, the raw\nmaterial for subsequent social transmission. However, environ-\nmental differences cannot account for all of the observed variation,\nsuggesting a role for social learning processes [23–27]. In captivity,\nthe evidence for social learning and transmission of novel behavior\nis undisputed, suggesting that the observed behavioral variation in\nthe wild is an expression of culture in chimpanzees [28–34].\nNevertheless, skepticism has remained, as it is difficult to rule out\nan unmeasured ecological variable as the cause of observed group\ndifferences. In addition, to date, there have been no direct\ndemonstrations of novel behavior spreading socially within a wild\nchimpanzee group, and it has remained unclear whether similar\nlearning mechanisms are at work in humans and other animals,\nrendering it hard to draw evolutionary inferences on whether\nchimpanzee and human cultures may result from fundamentally\nsimilar or different acquisition processes [16,35–37]. This ambi-\nguity could be resolved by testing whether the spread of novel\nbehavior follows the pathway predicted by social transmission.\nLeaf-sponging in chimpanzees is considered a behavioral\nuniversal [10], but there is considerable variation in how this\ntechnique is used in different communities [38]. The behavior is\ncustomary in the Sonso community, where most chimpanzees of\nall age classes display the behavior [10]. Sonso chimpanzees\ntypically manufacture leaf-sponges (LSs) by folding and chewing\nleaves in their mouth, subsequently using them in water sources to\ndrink [39] or, in experimental conditions, to collect honey [21]. In\nNovember 2011, members of the community visited a novel\nsponging site, a recently flooded waterhole located in swamp forest\nadjacent to a seasonal river. During 6 d of continuous observation,\nvarious individuals were observed to develop two tool behaviors,\nnovel to the group: ‘‘leaf-sponge re-use’’ and ‘‘moss-sponging.’’\nBoth behaviors spread partially through the group (Figure 1 and\n2). We defined ‘‘moss-sponging’’ (M) as the production of a sponge\nconsisting entirely of moss or a mixture of leaves and moss. Moss-\nsponging, while rare, has been previously documented in one\nother chimpanzee community [40] and one bonobo community\n[13]. We defined ‘‘leaf-sponge re-use’’ (RU1) as utilizing a\npreviously fabricated and used sponge that had been discarded\non a previous visit, in contrast to standard leaf-sponging where an\nindividual collects leaves from a branch. A second, more common\ntype of leaf-sponge re-use (RU2) consisted of infants obtaining a\nsponge directly from an older relative by begging or scrounging\n(see Materials and Methods). RU1 has been previously reported in\none other chimpanzee community but only in infants and juveniles\n[38].\nThe Sonso chimpanzees have been under continuous observa-\ntion for the last 20 years, with regular observations of LS and RU2\nbut no recorded observations of RU1 or M, suggesting that we\nobserved the initial spread or ‘‘diffusion’’ of two innovations to\ntheir tool repertoire [41].\nThe two novel behaviors emerged in an unusual ecological\ncontext, the discovery of a waterhole that had been repeatedly\nflooded by the river. By analyzing in parallel the spread of the two\nbehaviors and comparing the two groups of individuals who\nlearned them, we could determine whether the environment alone\ncould explain the spread or whether there was an added effect of\nsocial learning. To this end, we monitored the exact party\ncomposition of all individuals present at the waterhole, which\nallowed us to identify who observed whom performing the novel\nbehaviors and to construct the corresponding social network\nmodels. The different models were fitted to the data by maximum\nlikelihood and tested against models with no social transmission,\nusing corrected Akaike’s Information Criterion for small sample\nsize (AIC\nc). We included potentially confounding factors (age,\ngender) to investigate their effects on learning rates (see Materials\nand Methods) [7,8]. We considered a number of functional forms\n(see Materials and Methods) for the relationship between the\nnumber of observations and the rate of learning within the models\nfitted to the order in which individuals learned each behavior\n(Order-of-Acquisition Diffusion Analysis, OADA) and models\nfitted to the times at which they learned (Time-of-Acquisition\nDiffusion Analysis, TADA). Here, we only present the results from\nthe best dynamic network order of acquisition model (see\nSupporting Information for details of all models fitted). In the\nbest model, the number of observations of the target behavior had\na log-linear relationship with the rate at which that behavior was\nlearned; that is, each observation increased it by a specific ratio.\nWe used an information theoretic approach using AIC\nc to\ncompare the predictive power of dynamic and static networks\nand assess the evidence for social transmission.\nResults\nOur analysis starts with the alpha male NK extracting water\nfrom the waterhole and fabricating a moss-sponge (M, November\nAuthor Summary\nChimpanzees are widely considered as the most ‘‘cultural’’\nof all animals, despite the lack of direct evidence for the\nspread of novel behaviors through social learning in the\nwild. Here, we present a novel, dynamic network-based\ndiffusion analysis to describe the acquisition patterns of\nnovel tool-use behavior in the Sonso chimpanzee com-\nmunity of Budongo Forest, Uganda. We find strong\nevidence for social transmission of ‘‘moss-sponging’’ (the\nproduction of a sponge consisting of moss) along the\ninnovators’ social network, demonstrating that wild chim-\npanzees learn novel tool-use behaviors from each other\nand supporting the more general claim that some of the\nobserved behavioral diversity in wild chimpanzees should\nbe interpreted as ‘‘cultural.’’ Our model also estimated\nthat, for each new observation, naı¨ve individuals enhanced\ntheir chances of developing moss-sponging by a factor of\n15. We conclude that group-specific behavioral variants\ncan be socially learned in wild chimpanzees, addressing an\nimportant critique of the claim of culture in our closest\nrelatives.\nSocial Learning of Tool Use in Wild Chimpanzees\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 2 September 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 9 | e1001960\n14, 2011; 9:05 a.m.), while being observed by the adult dominant\nfemale NB. Over the following 6 d period, the waterhole was\nrevisited regularly and we observed a further seven individuals\nfabricating and using moss-sponges (M). For six of them, we could\nestablish that they had observed M before (see ‘‘Audience’’\ncriterion in Materials and Methods). For the seventh individual,\nthe dominant adult female KW, we could not confirm this, and we\ntreat her as having independently innovated M (November 16,\n2011; 9:07 a.m.), although this happened less than 1 min after\nhaving re-used another chimpanzee’s discarded moss-sponge\n(Figure 1).\nAlso on the 14th, subadult male FK retrieved and used a\ndiscarded LS (RU1). A further eight individuals developed the\nRU1 behavior, but four of them did so apparently without\nhaving observed another individual performing this behavior\n(Figure 2).\nFigure 1.

The dynamic\nnetwork NBDA had 12.3 6more support than the static network\nNBDA. Therefore, we report estimates of the effect of social\ntransmission from this model, although results were qualitatively\nsimilar for both models (see Supporting Information). For both\ndynamic and static networks, there was most support for models\nwith social transmission of moss-sponging but not RU1 (dynamic,\nTotal Akaike weight, Sw\ni = 0.754; static, Total Akaike weight,\nSwi = 0.801), in particular when comparing the support for these\nmodels to the support of models with no social transmission of\neither behavior (dynamic, 600,000 6; static, 18,000 6; Table 1).\nThe estimated social transmission effect for moss-sponging was an\n14.96 increase in learning rate for each observation of an\ninformed individual performing moss-sponging (95% C.I., 4.7 to\n88.2; Table 2), corresponding to an estimated 84.5% acquiring\nmoss-sponging by social transmission (excluding the innovator).\nFigure 2.

However, KW acquired M after re-using\nanother chimpanzee’s sponge that contained moss, suggesting\nsocial learning mediated through the products of the moss-\nsponging behavior, a pathway the network was not intended to\ncapture. With KW’s acquisition excluded, the effect of an\nobservation is estimated to be a 21.2 6increase in learning rate\n(95% C.I., 4.2 to 679), corresponding to an estimated approximate\n99.1% acquiring M by social transmission. An additional analysis\nsuggests that it is highly unlikely that the social transmission effect\nfor M is an artifact caused by differential exposure to the waterhole\n(see Supporting Information).\nThough we cannot rule out social transmission of RU1 (see\nTable 2), effects were weaker than for M ( Sw\ni = 0.246; compared\nwith the same social effect, Swi = 0.0003; Table 1). The social\neffect on moss-sponging was conservatively (i.e., with KW\nincluded) estimated to be 11.3 6 stronger than the social effect\non RU1 (95% C.I., 4.67 to 72.24). The estimated social\ntransmission effect for RU1 was only an increase of 1.07 6 for\neach observation (95% C.I., 0.58 to 2.48), corresponding to an\nestimated approximate 3.1% acquiring RU1 by social transmis-\nsion. Taken together, our results demonstrate a social transmission\neffect for M and a weak social transmission effect for RU1.\nDiscussion\nWe have applied a novel form of network analysis to investigate\nthe spread of two novel tool-use behaviors with the same function,\nwhich has produced evidence for social learning. The observed\npatterns of diffusion indicated that visiting a new resource jointly\nwas not sufficient to explain the spread of M by individual\nlearning, but that individuals influenced each other during\nacquisition. Our analyses also made it unlikely that some unknown\nvariable influenced both the network structure and the rate at\nwhich individuals acquired M. In contrast, we found strong\nevidence for a social effect on the diffusion of M and a weak one\nfor RU1, indicating that social learning plays a role in the\ntransmission of novel behaviors in wild chimpanzees.\nWhat factors could have favored the emergence of the two novel\nbehaviors? In our case, moss-sponging was unlikely to have been\ninvented because of a scarcity of leaves, which were widely available\n(see Supporting Information). Moreover, Sonso chimpanzees have\nregularly been observed manufacturing LS at other clay-pits,\npresumably to access minerals (Reynolds V, Lloyd AW, English CJ,\nLyons P, Dodd H, et al., Budongo Forest chimpanzees’ sodium\nresources: New adaptations, unpublished manuscript), but no moss-\nsponging has ever been documented, despite moss also being widely\navailable. Similarly, although chimpanzees routinely abandon LSs\nin and around tree holes throughout the forest, RU1 has never been\nobserved (although RU2 is common). A possible factor is that this\nsite appeared to attract larger groups and foster greater competition\nthan that which has usually been observed at water sources,\npotentially because of unusually high mineral levels (Reynolds V,\nLloyd AW, English CJ, Lyons P, Dodd H, et al., Budongo Forest\nchimpanzees’ sodium resources: New adaptations, unpublished\nmanuscript). It is plausible that the high levels of competition at the\nnew site favored innovation of moss-sponging. However, increased\nphysical proximity alone could not explain the subsequent spread of\nthe behavior in the group, as both moss and leaves were collected\nwithin 5 m from the waterhole, and leaf-sponging remained more\nTable 1.Total Akaike weight (support) for different models of social transmission of moss-sponging (M) and LS re-use (RU1),\nassuming (a) a static network and (b) a dynamic network.\nSocial Transmission Model Total Akaike Weight (Swi)\n(a) Static Network (b) Dynamic Network\n1.

The emergence of RU1\nmay reflect increased opportunities for encountering other chim-\npanzees’ leave-sponges. This interaction with discarded sponges\ncould be interpreted as a kind of social learning, not influenced by\ndirect observations, but akin to local or stimulus enhancement [46].\nHowever, it is unclear what specific information could be retrieved:\na discarded re-used sponge does not yield the information that it has\nbeen or may be ‘‘re-used’’ relative to a sponge that has only been\nused once. Only in the re-use of a moss-sponge by KW did some\ninformation appear to be gained: that moss can be employed as a\nsponging material, as she subsequently developed moss-sponging. In\ncontrast, our NBDA analysis showed that the subsequent diffusion\nof moss-sponging occurred along the innovators’ social network.\nAlthough ecological factors may have provided favorable conditions\nfor the initial innovation of moss-sponging, this cannot explain why,\nin the absence of social transmission, eight chimpanzees converged\non the solution within 6 d. Instead, it seems likely that while its\ninnovation was ecologically driven, the spread through the group\nwas a result of social transmission, paralleling findings in early\nhominins [47].\nOur study adds new evidence supporting the hypothesis that\nsome of the behavioral diversity seen in wild chimpanzees is the\nresult of social transmission and can therefore be interpreted as\ncultural, especially when considered together with previous results\nfrom the wild [10] and captivity [48]. Our findings were made\npossible by employing a novel version of the NBDA that can\nincorporate information about the time course of the recorded\nobservations. In doing so, our model captures a key aspect of social\nlearning—that is, who observed the novel behavior at what time\nand from whom. In previous static versions of NBDA, for example\nin humpback whales, long-term association patterns were used to\ninfer who had observed whom [8]. Our dynamic model requires\nfully habituated individuals that can be closely observed [49];\nhowever, where this is possible, it is more powerful, as is\ndemonstrated by the fact that dynamic networks were more\nsupported than corresponding static networks.\nPrevious studies of vervet monkeys [50,51] and captive\nchimpanzees [52] have found an influence of the model’s rank\non diffusion of behavior. Although our small sample size did not\nallow us to analyze rank effects, moss-sponging was first invented\nby the alpha male before spreading to two other individuals. And\nsimilarly, the second inventor, KW, was dominant over all the\nindividuals who learned moss-sponging from her [53]. As all\nindividuals appeared to develop the behavior directly after having\nobserved it, it was not possible to make inferences on whether\ndominant individuals transmitted the behavior more effectively\nthan others. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the social\nlearning effect was less marked in RU1, which was first\ndemonstrated by lower ranking individuals.\nAlthough our results suggest social learning of moss-sponging\nvia direct observation, the nature of the social learning mechanism\nremains unclear [54,55]. Chimpanzees display a range of social\nlearning mechanisms, including emulation and imitation [28–34],\nsimilarly to some monkey species [54,55]. Teaching and imitation\nare often said to be central in the diffusion of human culture\n[35,36,56,57], but other social learning mechanisms can also\ngenerate behavioral traditions [31,58]. For example, early\nhominins who contributed to the Oldowan technology (2.6 mya)\nmay have relied on emulative processes rather than imitation\n[47,59–61], in contrast to the later Acheulean technology [62,63].\nHowever, as our results do not allow us to identify the precise\nlearning mechanism employed during the social transmission of\nmoss-sponging, it remains possible that this may vary from those\non which humans rely to transmit their culture. Until the precise\nnature of these learning mechanisms is established, questions will\nremain about potential evolutionary discontinuity in the transmis-\nsion of ‘‘cultural’’ behavior [36].\nNevertheless, although social learning mechanisms are impor-\ntant, our data support a growing literature that refutes a strong\ndistinction between individual and social learning. Both rely on the\nsame basic understanding of physical cognition and only differ in\nthe presence or absence of a task-related social memory [64]. How\nexisting techniques were modified and what was transmitted may\nhave been equally important in the first stages of human evolution.\nIn our view, further progress in the study of animal culture must go\nbeyond the surface behavioral level, as is usually practiced, and\naddress the cognitive and neural processes involved during\ninnovation and social transmission [65]. For instance, both re-\nuse and moss-sponging appear to be modifications of existing\nbehaviors, rather than fully novel innovations. Observers may\nhave been aided by an already existing mental representation\nwhen acquiring the novel behavior [66,67] that they updated after\nobserving knowledgeable individuals [68,69]. Studying these\nprocesses in more detail in our closest relative and other animals\nmay thus inform our understanding of early hominin culture and\nthe evolutionary processes that eventually led to modern human\ncultures [70–72].\nMaterials and Methods\nEthics Statement\nPermission to conduct this research was given by the Uganda\nWildlife Authority (UWA), the Ugandan National Council for\nScience and Technology (UNCST), and the National Forestry\nAuthority (NFA).\nStudy Site and Subjects\nThe Budongo Conservation Field Station was established in\n1990 in the Budongo Forest Reserve, which lies in the western Rift\nValley in Uganda (1 u350–1u550 N, 31 u180–31u420 E) at a mean\naltitude of 1,050 m. The 793 km 2 Reserve includes 482 km 2 of\ncontinuous medium-altitude semideciduous forest cover. The\nSonso community has been under continuous observation since\nthe early 1990s with individuals individually known and habitu-\nated to human observers for about 20 y [39].\nDuring data collection in November 2011, the Sonso study\ncommunity of chimpanzees consisted of 68 named individuals.\nFollowing Reynolds [39], we defined age groups as infants (0–4 y),\njuveniles (5–9 y), subadults (m, 10–15 y; f, 10–14 y), and adults (m,\n16+ y; f, 15+ y). Using these categories, the group composition was\n30 adults (10 males and 20 females), 15 subadults (4 males and 11\nfemales), 13 juveniles (4 males and 9 females), and 10 infants (3\nmales and 7 females).\nProcedure\nData Collection and Site Location.Data were collected on\nNovember 14–19, 2011, between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m., at a socially\ncontested waterhole between the roots of two trees ( Cynometra\nalexandrii and Mimusops bagshawei) located in an area of recently\nflooded swamp forest approximately 5 m from a seasonal river\n(Figure S1). The hole contained high mineral levels compared with\nother nearby water sources, such as the river (Na, K, Ca, Mn, Cl)\n(Reynolds V, Lloyd AW, English CJ, Lyons P, Dodd H, et al.,\nBudongo Forest chimpanzees’ sodium resources: New adaptations,\nunpublished manuscript). All observed cases of leaf-tool fabrication\nand use were recorded using a hand-held high-definition\ncamcorder (Panasonic HD60) [73].\nSocial Learning of Tool Use in Wild Chimpanzees\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 6 September 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 9 | e1001960\nSponge Material. Although leaf-sponging was focused on the\nwaterhole, there were a number of additional stagnant puddles\nwithin a 3-m radius where individuals used LS tools and drank\ndirectly (Figure S2). Leaves used to manufacture sponges were\nidentified as Lasiodiscus mildbraedii, Lychnodiscus cerospermus,\nand Agromolera subspecies. Mosses were collected in the water-\nhole area when chimpanzees were absent. Species were identified\nas Pilotrichella cuspidate , Racopilum africanum (Mitt), and\nPinnatella minuta (Mitt). Additionally, two liverwort species,\nPlagiochila strictifolia (Steph) and Plagiochila pinniflora (Steph),\nwere identified. These primitive plants looked similar to flattened\nmosses and may have been part of the moss-sponges.\nDefinitions. Following Whiten et al. [11], LS is ‘‘wad of\nleaves/vegetation chewed and used to collect water, then squeezed\nin mouth.’’\nMoss-sponge, following Lanjouw [40], is defined as follows:\n‘‘chimpanzees collected moss off the bark of the trees, loosely\nrolled it into a bundle, generally not bigger than a few centimeters\nwide.’’ Moss-sponge was inserted into the mouth at least once\nbefore sponging. In both previous cases, the sponges appeared\nexclusively composed of moss despite leaves being freely available.\nIn Sonso, moss may be combined, but not necessarily, with leaves\nin the initial fabrication or added to an existing LS (Videos S1 and\nS2).\nFabrication is the removal/collection of leaves or moss and\nfabrication of sponge in mouth, but sponge is not subsequently\ndipped into water, for example, as access to the sponging location\nis blocked by another individual.\nUse is defined as dipping of sponge into water and insertion at\nleast once into mouth to suck the water.\nRe-use (type 1 and 2) is defined as follows: We coded as re-use\ntype 1 (Video S3) the recovery of a used sponge that had been\nfabricated by another individual (or possibly by the same\nindividual on a previous visit to the sponging location) and\ndiscarded. We distinguished this from re-use 2, a commonly\nobserved behavior in which infants beg or scrounge for sponges\nmade by their mother or older maternal siblings, as this is done\nwhile the older relative is using the sponge, as opposed to after\nthey have discarded it (Video S4). In Sonso, RU2 appears limited\nto immature individuals and has never been recorded in mature\nindividuals. Similarly, in West African chimpanzees ( P. t. verus),\nboth RU1 and RU2 are observed, but the behavior is only\ndisplayed by infants and juveniles [38].\nDrinking is defined as drinking directly with the mouth from the\nwater source.\nCoding. Video files were uploaded to an Apple MacBook Pro\nusing iMovie and edited into discrete clips for analysis. We coded\nthe following variables for all occurrences of leaf-tool fabrication,\n(re-)use, and direct drinking: date, individual identity, party\ncomposition, specific audience (individuals within 1 m), fabrication\nof sponge (removal of material and fabrication of sponge in mouth,\ncollection of discarded sponge from the ground), use of sponge for\ndrinking (sponge dipped in water and back to mouth at least once),\nsponge material (leaf or moss), and location (sponging-hole or\npuddle).\nAudience. Individuals within 1 m of the model while the\nmodel was fabricating the sponge, but excluding individuals with\neither their head turned fully away or with their view obstructed\nby the environment (for example, sitting behind a tree-buttress or\nwith their head inside the waterhole), were considered to be\n‘‘potential observers.’’\nA second more restrictive definition was also applied for the\n‘‘specific audience’’ in which individuals had to be within 1 m of\nthe model and were considered to have actively looked at the\nmodel while the sponge was fabricated. This specific audience\nincluded individuals who were seen to shift their eye gaze to the\nmodel or to track the model’s movements with their head\nmovements or who had their head facing the model 645u (as per\n[74]).\nNetwork Reconstruction. A separate network was con-\nstructed for M and RU1. In each case, a directed edge was\nconsidered to exist between two individuals, from X to Y if there\nwas at least one registered occurrence of X observing Y\nperforming the RU1 or M behavior prior to X acquiring the\nrelevant behavior themselves. The latter criterion was included as\nbehavior can only be transmitted by observations that occur prior\nto acquisition of behavior and such that a positive result could not\nbe indicative of homophily—that is, individuals who acquire a\nbehavior being subsequently attracted to one another and thus\nobserving each other more. The weight of the directed edge, a\nYX,\nwas equal to the number of such occurrences.\nFor the dynamic social network, the edges were allowed to vary\nover time. Here, aYX(t) was taken to be the number of times X had\nobserved Y performing the target behavior prior to time t. We also\nconsidered a binary dynamic network, where a YX(t) was taken to\nbe 1 if X had observed Y performing the target behavior prior to\ntime t, and 0 otherwise. We included this to allow for the\npossibility that a single observation of the target behavior may be\nsufficient for a maximal social transmission effect to occur.\nStatistical Analysis\nTo analyze the spread of the behaviors, we entered information\nabout all individuals who used at least one tool at the tree-hole in\nNBDA models ( N = 30). We ran an OADA [2] treating M and\nRU1 as independent diffusions included in the same model,\nallowing us to test for difference in the social transmission effect.\nWe used the R script model for NBDA Version 1.2.11 available at\nhttp://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/freeware.html.\nNBDA is based on survival analysis models and so assumes that\nthe spread of the behavior is a stochastic process and that a naı ¨ve\nindividual, i, has at any time a given learning rate, l\ni tðÞ , for each\nbehavior pattern in question. We included a number of potentially\nconfounding variables: x 1, age (in years); x 2, time spent in the\ncommunity (in years); x 3, sex (0/1 for female/male, respectively).\nThese data were extracted from the Sonso community official list\nof individuals downloaded at http://www.budongo.org/. There is\nlittle support for an important effect of any individual-level\nvariable (see Table S2). We considered both conventional NBDA\nmodels with the static social network and expanded the approach\nto include the dynamic network described above. For the static\nnetwork NBDA, there are two functional forms for inclusion of\nindividual-level variables in an NBDA [2], a model in which the\ninteraction between social transmission and the individual-level\nvariables is taken to be additive:\nl\ni tðÞ ~l0 tðÞ s\nX30\nj~1\naij zj tðÞ zexp b1x1zb2x2zb3x3ðÞ\n\"#\n1{zi tðÞðÞ ,\nand one in which it is taken to be multiplicative:\nli tðÞ ~l0 tðÞ s\nX30\nj~1\naij zj tðÞ z1\n\"#\nexp b1x1zb2x2zb3x3ðÞ½/C138 1{zi tðÞðÞ ,\nwhere l0 tðÞ is a baseline rate function, which in OADA remains\nunspecified; s is the effect of social transmission per occasion i\nobserved j; bk is the multiplicative effect of individual-level\nSocial Learning of Tool Use in Wild Chimpanzees\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 7 September 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 9 | e1001960\nvariable k on the log scale; and zi(t) is an indicator variable that\ntakes the value 1 if i has acquired the behavior by time t and 0\notherwise. Both additive and multiplicative models were fitted:\nFindings were similar for each, but the multiplicative model had\nslightly better support (see Table S1), as reported in the main text.\nThe log-likelihood for acquisition event l, occurring at time t\nl,a t\nwhich individual m acquired the behavior is:\nlog LlðÞ ~log ln tlðÞðÞ {log\nX30\nm~1\nlm tlðÞ\n !\n:\nThe log-likelihood for the whole diffusion is calculated by\nsumming across all acquisition events. In a reanalysis, we excluded\nthe M acquisition event for KW (see main text) by simply\nexcluding this acquisition event from the likelihood function.\nProportion of acquisitions that were by social transmission was\nestimated for the best model (with no individual-level variables) by\ncalculating for each acquisition event l.1:\ns\nX30\nj~1\naij zj tlðÞ\n\"# ,\ns\nX30\nj~1\naij zj tlðÞ z1\n\"#\n:\nHere, the numerator is the rate of social transmission relative to\nthe rate of asocial learning at time of the l-th acquisition event, and\nthe denominator is the total rate of learning relative to the rate of\nasocial learning. Therefore, the whole equation gives the\nprobability that event l occurred by social transmission, predicted\nby the model. By averaging across all acquisition events except the\ninitial acquisition, we obtain the estimated proportion of events\n(excluding the innovation) that occurred by social transmission.\nA static network based on observations does not fully allow for\nthe time course of observations. To illustrate, one can imagine a\ngroup of three individuals: A, B, and C. A learns the behavior first.\nNext, B observes A performing the behavior three times and then\nlearns the behavior. Finally, C observes A performing the behavior\nthree times and subsequently learns the behavior last. A static\nnetwork would represent the network as having links of strength 3\nfrom A to both B and C, so an NBDA model based on such a\nnetwork would predict that B and C were equally likely to learn\nsecond. In fact, we would expect B to be more likely to learn\nsecond, because B observed A performing the behavior first. A\ndynamic network allows us to incorporate this information into the\nNBDA.\nWe considered a number of different functional forms for the\ndynamic network. First, we considered a model in which each\nsuccessive observation of the target behavior had a linear\nrelationship with the rate of learning. As with the static network\nNBDA, we considered models in which the interaction with\nindividual-level variables was taken either to be additive or to be\nmultiplicative. These models are identical to those given above,\nexcept a\nij is replaced with aij(t). We also considered a form where the\neffect of each successive observation of the target behavior had a\nlinear effect on the log scale, on the rate of learning—that is, each\nsuccessive observation multiplied the rate of learning by exp(s):\nl\ni tðÞ ~l0 tðÞ exp s\nX30\nj~1\naij tðÞ zb1x1zb2x2zb3x3\n !\n1{zi tðÞðÞ :\nWe refer to this as the log-linear model. Here a single\nobservation adds s to the linear predictor [inside the exp() term]\nhaving the effect of multiplying the rate of learning by a factor of\nexp(s). We also considered a version of the log-linear model in\nwhich the interaction with individual-level variables was additive:\nli tðÞ ~l0 tðÞ exp s\nX30\nj~1\naij tðÞ\n !\nzexp zb1x1zb2x2zb3x3ðÞ\n\"#\n1{zi tðÞðÞ ,\nbut this had less support than the multiplicative version (see Table\nS1).\nFor our dynamic network, the log-linear model is equivalent to\nincluding the number of observations of the target behavior prior\nto time t as a time-varying covariate in a Cox model [75]. This\nallowed us to use the survival package [76] to fit the models in the\nR statistical environment [77] to include a random (or frailty)\neffect to account for the fact that each diffusion included the same\nindividuals. However, the random effect was estimated to be\nnegligible and had no effect on the results, corresponding to the\nfact that each behavior diffused through a different subset of the\ngroup (with the exception of KW). Consequently, we dropped the\nrandom effect from the analysis. The model using the binary\ndynamic network is specified using the same equation as the log-\nlinear model. The likelihood function given above for the static\nnetwork NBDA is valid for all models given here.\nAnalogously to the linear model, the proportion of acquisitions\nthat were by social transmission was estimated for the best log-\nlinear model (with time in population included) using the dynamic\nnetwork by calculating for each acquisition event l.1:\nexp s P30\nj~1\naij tðÞ zb2x2\n !\n{exp b2x2ðÞ\nexp s P30\nj~1\naij tðÞ zb2x2\n ! :\nHere the numerator is the estimated rate of learning at the time\nof acquisition of the behavior minus the rate that would be\nexpected under asocial conditions, and so can be thought of as the\nrate of social transmission. The denominator is the total rate of\nlearning at the time of acquisition, so the fraction gives the\nprobability the event occurred by social transmission. Averaging\nacross all acquisition events except the initial innovation gives the\nestimated proportion of acquisitions that were by social transmis-\nsion, excluding the innovation, which is known not to have\noccurred by social transmission.\nWe used an information theoretic approach using Akaike’s\nInformation Criterion corrected for sample size (AIC\nc) to allow for\nmodel selection uncertainty. This allowed us to estimate the\nsupport for each variable/model of social transmission, calculate\nmodel-averaged estimates of effects, and construct unconditional\nconfidence intervals using profile likelihood methods [78].\nTime of Acquisition Diffusion Analysis\nBecause the TADA can have more statistical power than\nOADA [2], we fitted TADA models to check the robustness of our\nfindings. The times of learning entered into the models were the\ncumulative time across days, including only times at which the\ngroup was present at the waterhole—to allow for the fact that the\nrate of learning would be zero when the group was not present at\nSocial Learning of Tool Use in Wild Chimpanzees\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 8 September 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 9 | e1001960\nthe waterhole. We fitted models assuming a constant baseline\nfunction l0 tðÞ ~l0, and models allowing for the possibility that\nl0 tðÞ might systematically increase or decrease over time [79]. We\nalso fitted models in which the baseline rate differed between M\nand RU1, to allow for differences in the asocial rate of learning.\nFor the TADA analysis, the best model was the standard linear\nform of NBDA: Here we report the results of this set of models,\nthough other functional forms gave similar results. For many\nmodels, the estimated Hessian matrix could not be inverted, so we\ncould not reliably extract standard errors, meaning we could not\ncalculate confidence intervals allowing for model selection\nuncertainty [78]. Consequently traditional confidence intervals\nare reported for TADA—that is, conditional on the best model\ncontaining the relevant parameter.\nThere was stronger evidence for social transmission of RU1\n(same social effect as for M, Sw\ni = 0.289; different social effects,\nSwi = 0.268) though still more support for social transmission of\nmoss-sponging only ( Swi = 0.443). For moss-sponging, s was\nestimated at 42.5 (95% C.I. = 6.74–814). corresponding to\n84.3% (77.5%–85.6%) of acquisition events by social transmission,\nexcluding the innovator. For leaf-sponging re-use, s was estimated\nto be 1.18 (95% C.I. = 0–6.78) corresponding to 22.3% (0%–\n36.4%) of acquisition events occurring by social transmission. The\ndifference in s parameters (M – RU1) was estimated to be 41.3\n(95% C.I. = 5.16–800). Therefore, the results of the TADA are\nqualitatively similar to the results of the OADA. In the main text,\nwe present the results of the OADA as it makes fewer assumptions\nabout the underlying baseline rate: although we can allow for a\nsystematically increasing baseline rate using TADA, it is difficult to\nallow for a fluctuating rate, caused by changing conditions in the\nenvironment—for example, temperature changes affecting moti-\nvation to drink [33]. Consequently, we suspect OADA is likely to\nbe more reliable in uncontrolled conditions.\nStrict Observation Criterion\nTo assess the robustness of our findings to the judgments we\nmade about who observed whom, we repeated both OADA and\nTADA analyses using static and dynamic networks based on a\nstricter criterion of recording observation (see above). Overall the\nstrict network had 0.43 6less support than the less strict network\nfor OADA, and slightly more support for TADA (1.2 6). In both\ncases, the Akaike weights showed a similar pattern of support using\neach observation criterion (see Table S1 and Figures S4 and S5).\nNote that both (a) recording of nonobserving individuals as\nobservers and (b) failure to record observers will obscure any\nexisting relationship between the observation network and the\npattern of diffusion. This has two consequences: First, a stricter\nobservation criterion does not necessarily mean a more accurate\nestimate of s parameters, as it may reduce cases of a but at the\npotential cost of increasing cases of b. Second, in either case, the\neffect of such errors in recording will be a tendency to\nunderestimate social transmission effects, so the reported social\ntransmission of M could not be the result of a bias arising from\nerrors in recording who observed whom.\nControlling for Exposure to the Waterhole\nA potentially confounding variable is the different level of\nexposure each chimpanzee had to the waterhole. A priori,i t\nseemed possible that chimpanzees that interacted with the\nwaterhole more frequently would be more likely to acquire both\nbehavior patterns than chimpanzees that interacted with the water\nhole less frequently. If this exposure was correlated with\nobservation of others performing M, this could create a spurious\nsocial transmission effect. To an extent, the different level of social\ntransmission for M and RU1 weakens the case for this\nexplanation, as we would expect an exposure effect to operate\nsimilarly on both behavior patterns. Nonetheless, we ran\nadditional analyses to allow for the potential effects.\nWe calculated an exposure score for each chimpanzee for each\nbehavior pattern as being the rate at which each chimpanzee\ninteracted with the waterhole—that is, initiated bouts of normal\nleaf-sponging behavior. If a chimpanzee did not acquire the\nbehavior pattern in question (M or RU1), exposure was calculated\nover the whole period for which we observed the chimpanzees at\nthe waterhole ( = number of interactions/total observation time).\nFor chimpanzees that acquired a behavior pattern, the corre-\nsponding exposure score was calculated over the time preceding\nacquisition of that behavior (e.g. = number of interactions prior to\nacquiring M/time at which M was acquired), as exposures\nexperienced after acquiring M (for example) cannot exert a causal\neffect on the acquisition of M.\nWe first added exposure score as a predictor to the best model\nfor the OADA reported in the main text, with exposure\nconstrained to have the same effect on both M and RU1. This\nmodel had 0.436less support, the effect of exposure was estimated\nto be small, and the estimate of the social transmission parameter\nremained very similar (s = 2.79). We then wished to allow for the\npossibility that exposure might affect only M, thus resulting in a\nspurious social transmission effect for M. This model had 3.92 6\nmore support than the previous best OADA model. However,\ncontrary to expectations, the effect of exposure was estimated to be\nnegative with a 9.3% reduction in rate of acquisition for one\nstandard deviation difference in exposure score (see Figure S6).\nMost importantly, the effect of social transmission was estimated to\nbe slightly higher in this model (s = 3.00), suggesting that\ndifferential exposure to the waterhole is unlikely to have resulted\nin a spurious social transmission effect for M.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Location of the waterhole between the roots of the\ntwo trees (photo by Nina Ha¨nninen, with permission).\n(TIF)\nFigure S2 Broad view of the two trees (right, individual NB) and\nthe puddles (left, individual OK) at the sponging location (photo by\nCatherine Hobaiter).\n(TIF)\nFigure S3 Proportion of individuals using different techniques at\nthe waterhole (November 14–19).

LS, leaf-sponge;\nM, moss; RU1, re-use 1; ALT, alternative technique (M and RU1\ncombined); D, drink; DAY, days passed. To investigate whether the\nuse of alternative techniques (M, RU1) was correlated to a decrease\nin available LS material, we ran Pearson’s correlations using\nfrequency of individual users per day per technique, and of each\ntechnique versus days passed, including drinking. If increased direct\ndrinking were correlated with decreased users of LS, this may\nindicate an environmental constraint on tool production. There was\nno evidence of a correlation between the number of chimpanzees\nexhibiting the new techniques and the number of days passed (see\nFigure S3), suggesting that material availability did not influence\ntool choice. Furthermore, we found no correlations across days\nbetween the number of cases of LS and cases of either RU1, M, or\nRU1 and M combined, showing that selection of the techniques, old\nand new, were not associated. * In order to control for the varying\nnumber of individuals at the site per day, these tests are of number of\nindividuals using the technique/total number of individuals,\ncorrelated against the number of days past.
