    "abstract": "The integration of AI assistants, especially through the development of Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs), into computer science education has sparked significant\\ndebate. An emerging body of work has looked into using LLMs in education, but\\nfew have examined the impacts of LLMs on students in entry-level programming\\ncourses, particularly in real-world contexts and over extended periods. To\\naddress this research gap, we conducted a semester-long, between-subjects study\\nwith 50 students using CodeTutor, an LLM-powered assistant developed by our\\nresearch team. Our study results show that students who used CodeTutor (the\\nexperimental group) achieved statistically significant improvements in their\\nfinal scores compared to peers who did not use the tool (the control group).\\nWithin the experimental group, those without prior experience with LLM-powered\\ntools demonstrated significantly greater performance gain than their\\ncounterparts. We also found that students expressed positive feedback regarding\\nCodeTutor's capability, though they also had concerns about CodeTutor's limited\\nrole in developing critical thinking skills. Over the semester, students'\\nagreement with CodeTutor's suggestions decreased, with a growing preference for\\nsupport from traditional human teaching assistants. Our analysis further\\nreveals that the quality of user prompts was significantly correlated with\\nCodeTutor's response effectiveness. Building upon our results, we discuss the\\nimplications of our findings for integrating Generative AI literacy into\\ncurricula to foster critical thinking skills and turn to examining the temporal\\ndynamics of user engagement with LLM-powered tools. We further discuss the\\ndiscrepancy between the anticipated functions of tools and students' actual\\ncapabilities, which sheds light on the need for tailored strategies to improve\\neducational outcomes.\\n",
