Here we propose the alexithymia \nlanguage hypothesis - the hypothesis that language impairment can give rise to \nalexithymia - and critically review relevant evidence from healthy populations, \ndevelopmental disorders, adult-onset illness and acquired brain injury. We conclude that \nthe available evidence is supportive of the alexithymia-language hypothesis, and \ntherefore that language impairment may represent one of multiple routes to alexithymia. \nWhere evidence is lacking, we outline which approaches will be useful in testing this \nhypothesis.  \nKeywords: Alexithymia; Emotion development; Emotion recognition; Language. \n \n \n  \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n3 \n \nThe role of language in alexithymia: moving towards a multi-route model of \nalexithymia \nAlexithymia is characterised by difficulties identifying and describing one’s emotions, \nand a tendency towards externally oriented thinking (Nemiah, Freyberger, & Sifneos, \n1976). Research has demonstrated the negative impact of alexithymia across a broad \nrange of cognitive domains, in both typical and clinical populations, including decision \nmaking (Kano, Ito, & Fukudo, 2011), recognition of emotional facial expressions \n(Brewer, Cook, Cardi, Treasure, & Bird, 2015; Cook, Brewer, Shah, & Bird, 2013; \nGrynberg et al., 2012), empathy (Grynberg, Luminet, Corneille, Grèzes, & Berthoz, \n2010), moral judgements (Patil, Melsbach, Hennig-fast, & Silani, 2016; Patil & Silani, \n2014a, 2014b), reward processing (Foulkes, Bird, Gökçen, McCrory, & Viding, 2015) \nand pro-social behavior (FeldmanHall, Dalgleish, & Mobbs, 2013). While alexithymia \nseverity varies in the general population, it is elevated in multiple psychiatric conditions, \nincluding schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, substance and alcohol abuse, and \nfeeding and eating disorders, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders and populations \nwith traumatic brain injury (Berthoz & Hill, 2005; Henry, Phillips, Crawford, Theodorou, \n& Summers, 2006; Pinard, Negrete, Annable, & Audet, 1996; Schmidt, Jiwany, & \nTreasure, 1993; Sturm & Levenson, 2011; Thorberg, Young, Sullivan, & Lyvers, 2009; \nvan ’t Wout, Aleman, Bermond, & Kahn, 2007). Additionally, alexithymia is associated \nwith emotion regulation impairment, increased risk of self-harm, and poorer therapy \noutcomes for some forms of psychological interventions (Norman & Borrill, 2015; \nOgrodniczuk, Piper, & Joyce, 2011; Pandey, Saxena, & Dubey, 2011).  \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n4 \n \nUnderstanding the causes of alexithymia therefore has clear implications for \ntheories of emotion, decision-making and social cognition, and practical applications for \nmental health services. Work is beginning to address which cognitive processes are \nnecessary in order to identify and describe one’s own emotions, and therefore which \ncognitive impairments may give rise to alexithymia. Much research has focused on \ninteroception (the perception and recognition of the internal state of one’s body; Craig, \n2002, 2003, 2009). Nonetheless, the impairments associated with alexithymia are \ncomplex and high-level skills that presumably rely on, and interact with, a number of \ncognitive processes. The interoception hypothesis presents one account of how deficits in \none cognitive process - interoception - may impact on the ability to identify one's \nemotions. However, there are likely multiple cognitive routes to alexithymia, which may \nexist independently of each other, or interact with each other.  \nThe current paper proposes that language impairment may contribute to \nalexithymia. At first glance, the role of language in alexithymia seems obvious, and even \ntautological. Alexithymia literally translates from Greek as “lack of words for emotion”, \nand a core element of alexithymia is a difficulty expressing (including talking about) \nemotions. However, there are deeper theoretical reasons to expect language to contribute \nto alexithymia, beyond this superficial overlap. Most, if not all, theories of emotions posit \nthat language processes contribute to emotion processes, though the nature of this \ncontribution varies between nativist and constructivist theories. According to \nconstructionist theories, language processes may drive the categorization of emotional \nexperience, and emotion words act as key components in children’s development of \nemotion concepts (see Lindquist, MacCormack, & Shablack, 2015). From a nativist \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n5 \n \nviewpoint, while emotion categories are innately specified, language still plays an \ninfluential role in the development of emotion schemas, emotional decision making and \nregulation (Izard, 2007b; see section “A role for language in theories of emotion” below).  \nA recent review by Welding and Samur (2018) has highlighted the abnormalities \nin emotion-related language in alexithymia. However, in order to examine whether \nalexithymia arises due to broader language-related deficits, it is crucial to examine \nperformance on non-emotional language tasks. If alexithymia is unrelated to language, \nother linguistic processes should be unaffected. In contrast, abnormalities in non-\nemotional language would suggest a broader underlying linguistic deficit.   \nDespite the hypothesized link between language and emotion processing, there \nhas been very limited study of language abilities in alexithymia. This may be due to the \nfinding that those with alexithymia are impaired on emotion recognition tasks that are \nnon-verbal in design, suggesting that impairments are not limited to the language domain \n(Lane et al., 1996). However, this argument ignores the potential role of language in the \ninitial development of emotional understanding. Furthermore, even tasks that do not \ninclude verbal stimuli or require verbal responses can be affected by language abilities. \nFor example, acquired language impairment affects putatively “non-verbal” tasks: in a \nlarge group of individuals with acquired aphasia, language impairment influenced \nperformance on picture-based reasoning tasks usually described as capturing “non-verbal \nIQ”  (Baldo, Paulraj, Curran, & Dronkers, 2015). Indeed, it has been argued that “There \nis no such thing as ‘nonverbal’ ability—only abilities that are expressed nonverbally” \n(McGrew and Flanagan, 1998, p. 25).  \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n6 \n \nAims and scope \nThe aim of this review is to provide an overview of the existing evidence relevant \nto the alexithymia-language hypothesis, which suggests that language deficits contribute \nto increased alexithymia. While previous reviews have described emotion-related \nlanguage abnormalities in alexithymia (Welding & Samur, 2018), the current article \nexamines evidence for problems in language beyond simply emotion-related language, \nwith the aim of ascertaining whether language problems might provide a causative \nexplanation for alexithymia.  \nFirst, we introduce the alexithymia-interoception hypothesis. Under this ‘multiple \nroutes to alexithymia’ model, we predict that some populations may have alexithymia \ndue to interoceptive impairment, while other populations may have alexithymia due a \nlanguage problem. We then establish the theoretical basis for the role of language in \nemotion in more depth, under both nativist and constructionist perspectives. This is not a \nfull review of theories of emotion, but is used to demonstrate that language impairment is \nexpected to affect emotion processing under most, if not all, theoretical perspectives. We \nthen address the challenges surrounding the contribution of language skills to the \nmeasurement of alexithymia.  \nWe then review the available evidence relevant to the alexithymia-language \nhypothesis, from typical adults and patient populations with late-occurring or \nneurodegenerative conditions, respectively. We also outline why the hypothesis of a link \nbetween alexithymia and language impairment should be investigated with \ndevelopmental groups, particularly in developmental language disorder (DLD) and \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n7 \n \nchildren with language difficulties acquired as a result of hearing loss. Where direct \nevidence is currently lacking, we outline why a link would be expected in these \npopulations, and why gathering direct evidence of alexithymia in these groups is of \ntheoretical importance.  \nGiven the growing evidence relating interoception to alexithymia, we outline a \ntheoretical model of how language impairment and/or interoceptive deficits may give rise \nto alexithymia. We suggest that interoception and language may play distinct, but \npotentially interacting, roles in the development of alexithymia, and that the contribution \nof each may vary across clinical and developmental populations. Further challenges that \nshould be addressed and avenues for future research are then discussed. \nFor clarity, it is worth noting other constructs that are closely related to, or \noverlap with, alexithymia. These include emotion differentiation/granularity, and \nemotional awareness. Emotional granularity (often referred to interchangeably as \nemotional differentiation; see Smidt & Suvak, 2015) describes the extent to which an \nindividual can distinguish between emotional states (Barrett, 2004). A simple definition \nof emotional awareness is the conscious experience of emotions (Gu, Hof, Friston & Fan, \n2013). One could consider alexithymia to represent a trait, while other constructs may be \nthought of as more specific abilities, which are negatively associated with the broader \ntrait of alexithymia: i.e. in cases of high alexithymia, there is lower emotional granularity \nand emotional awareness. This paper focuses on alexithymia, but many of the arguments \nmade for the role of language in alexithymia could be applied to the more narrowly-\ndefined constructs of emotional granularity and awareness. \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n8 \n \nIn addition, while the definition of alexithymia pertains to a difficulty processing \none’s own emotions, there have been several other sociocognitive difficulties and \ndemonstrated to be (moderately or strongly) associated with alexithymia (Grynberg, \nBerthoz & Bird, 2018). These include interpersonal difficulties, particularly decreased \nempathy (Grynberg, etal., 2010), poor emotion regulation (Pandey et al., 2011), poor \nmental health, difficulties recognizing others’ emotions (Brewer et al., 2015; Cook, et al., \n2013; Grynberg et al., 2012), and increased somatization (De Gucht & Heiser, 2003; \nMattila et al., 2008). These problems in and of themselves are not definitive markers for \nalexithymia. However, in the absence of direct investigation of alexithymia in a given \npopulation, the presence of such problems make it plausible that levels of alexithymia are \nincreased. As a consequence, this work should be considered both as a review of the \navailable research, and as an opinion piece that advances a specific hypothesis and the \nways in which it might be tested.  \nInteroception and alexithymia \nContemporary theories suggest that alexithymia may be, at least in part, a \nconsequence of a primary deficit in interoception, the ability to perceive and recognize \ninternal body states, including signals of fatigue, hunger, thirst, heart rate, respiratory \neffort, and pain (Brewer, Cook, & Bird, 2016; Herbert, Herbert, & Pollatos, 2011; \nMurphy, Brewer, Catmur, & Bird, 2017; Murphy, Brewer, Hobson, Catmur, & Bird, \n2018; Pollatos, Kirsch, & Schandry, 2005; Wiens, 2005). Thus, individuals who struggle \nto identify their own emotions may also struggle to detect and distinguish non-emotional \ninteroceptive states, such as thirst, hunger and tiredness. Indeed, individuals with \nalexithymia are objectively worse at perceiving their own heartbeat (Herbert et al., 2011; \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n9 \n \nShah, Hall, Catmur, & Bird, 2016), muscular effort and taste (Murphy, Catmur, & Bird, \n2018), are less likely to rely on interoceptive cues to gauge respiratory effort (Murphy et \nal., 2018). They also report difficulties recognising interoceptive cues associated with a \nbroad range of internal states (Brewer et al., 2016; Longarzo et al., 2015). Individuals \nwith alexithymia also report difficulties differentiating between emotion-related and non-\nemotion-related interoceptive signals (Brewer et al., 2016). Relatedly, alexithymia is \nassociated with increased somatising and unexplained medical symptoms (e.g. De Gucht \n& Heiser, 2003; Mattila et al., 2008), theorised to be due to misinterpretation of benign \ninteroceptive signals as troubling medical symptoms (Larsen, Brand, Bermond, & \nHijman, 2003; Taylor, Bagby, & Parker, 1991). Indeed, the links between somatisation \nand alexithymia extend back to the very conception of alexithymia in the 1970s (Sifneos, \n1973). In addition to behavioural work suggesting a link between interoception and \nalexithymia, neuroimaging and lesion studies indicate that alexithymia is associated with \nfunctional and structural abnormalities or damage to cortical areas involved in \ninteroception, in particular the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex (Bush, Luu, & \nPosner, 2000; Goerlich-Dobre, Bruce, Martens, Aleman, & Hooker, 2014; Gu et al., \n2012; Hogeveen, Bird, Chau, Krueger, & Grafman, 2016; Ihme et al., 2013; Moriguchi et \nal., 2007; Silani et al., 2008).  \nFurthermore, a number of the conditions that are characterised by an increased \nprevalence of alexithymia also show abnormalities in interoception. Objective \nimpairments in interoception in clinical groups have been demonstrated using widely-\nused cardiac measures of interoception, such as the heartbeat tracking and heartbeat \ndiscrimination tasks (in anxiety and panic disorder; Ehlers & Breuer, 1992; Paulus & \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n10 \n \nStein, 2010; Yoris et al., 2015;  in alcohol and substance abuse; Naqvi & Bechara, 2010; \nPaulus & Stewart, 2014; Paulus, Tapert, & Schulteis, 2009; Verdejo-Garcia, Clark, & \nDunn, 2012; in depression; Dunn, Dalgleish, Ogilvie, & Lawrence, 2007; Harshaw, 2015; \nPollatos, Traut‐Mattausch, & Schandry, 2009; in somatoform disorders; Schaefer, Egloff, \n& Witthöft, 2012; in autism; Garfinkel, Tiley, et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2016; in OCD; \nLazarov, Dar, Oded, & Liberman, 2010; Stern, 2014; in eating disorders; Klabunde, \nAcheson, Boutelle, Matthews, & Kaye, 2013; and in schizophrenia; Ardizzi et al., 2016). \nIn addition, other evidence highlights unusual interoception in clinical conditions. For \nexample, patients with eating disorders atypical neural responses during the perception of \nhunger and satiety signals (Santel, Baving, Krauel, Münte, & Rotte, 2006). According to \ncare-giver reports and free-feeding observations, patients with frontotemporal dementia \nshow a disturbance in their food preferences and satiety levels (Ikeda, Brown, Holland, \nFukuhara, & Hodges, 2002; Woolley et al., 2007). Substance and alcohol abuse is related \nto reduced sensitivity to reward signals and poor awareness of intoxication levels (for a \nreview, see Volkow, Wang, Fowler, Tomasi, & Baler, 2010).   \nIn sum, there is compelling evidence for the role on interoception in the \ndevelopment of alexithymia. Nonetheless, it seems improbable that all cases of \nalexithymia will be able to be reduced to an impairment in interoception, or that an \ninteroceptive difficulty can account for all clinical populations in which alexithymia is \nelevated. Interoception has long been considered to be necessary for emotion (Darwin, \n1965; Gendron & Barrett, 2009; James, 1894; Lange, 1885), but language is also \nconsidered to underpin emotion processing (although the precise role of language is a \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n11 \n \nmatter of debate). In the following section, we outline why a language impairment may \nbe affect emotion processing, and ultimately result in alexithymia.  \nA role for language in theories of emotion \nOver the decades, many different theories of emotion have been proposed (see \nBrosch, Portois & Sander, 2010, and Moors, 2009, for comprehensive reviews of theories \nof emotion). While there are numerous ways of categorizing this broad spectrum of \ntheories, one approach is to place these theories on a continuum anchored by nativist \ntheories at one extreme and constructionist theories at the other. Both types of theory \nascribe some role for language in the development of emotion processes, although they \ndiffer in the extent to which language is considered “foundational” for emotion \ncategorization (see Sauter, 2018, for a recent discussion). \nNativist theories of emotion, such as Differential Emotion Theory (DET), argue \nthat certain discrete emotion categories (“basic emotions”) are innate, having evolved for \ntheir adaptive value (Ekman, 1992; Izard, 2007a, 2009). These categories cannot be \ncreated, taught, or learned via cognitive processes. Even so, language is still afforded a \ncentral role in emotion-related processes within nativist theories: while language may not \nhave a role in the ontogeny of basic emotions themselves, theories such as DET argue \nthat language is crucial in the development of emotion schemas, which involve emotion \ninteracting dynamically with perception and cognitive processes. Emotion schema \ndevelopment is considered important, as dysfunctional connections between emotion, \ncognition and action are thought to lead to psychopathology (Izard, Youngstrom, Fine, \nMostow, & Trentacosta, 2006). Furthermore, recent reviews that outline evidence against \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n12 \n \nlinguistic relativity of emotions still acknowledge a role for language in later-occurring \ncognitive processes central to emotion. For example, Sauter (2018) suggests that verbal \nprocesses may affect decision-making during emotion categorization, even if the \ncategories themselves are not the product of linguistic processes. \nAt the other end of the spectrum, constructionist accounts such as Conceptual Act \nTheory (CAT) (Barrett, 2006), or the circumplex model of affect (Posner, Russell & \nPeterson, 2005), suggest that the “natural kinds” of emotion proposed by nativist \naccounts do not exist. Rather, discrete emotion categories are the result of conceptual \nprocesses acting on underlying dimensional, non-specific affect. Emotion categories are \nnot considered to be pre-destined by evolution but rather to emerge, dependent upon \nculture and development.  \nAccounts such as CAT do not argue that the structure of individuals’ emotional \nexperiences is wholly determined by linguistic factors. Rather, language is one of many \nfactors that contribute to emotional development. One proposed mechanism by which this \noccurs is that emotion words support the acquisition of conceptual knowledge, just as \nlabels support category acquisition and the development of conceptual knowledge in \nother domains (for instance, in learning abstract spatial relations between objects; see \nCasasola, 2005. See also Althaus & Mareschal, 2014; Plunkett, Hu, & Cohen, 2008). For \nexample, a child may hear the word “angry” in several scenarios, which have little \nperceptually in common: they may witness a friend get “angry” at the theft of a toy, they \nmay be told their caregiver is “angry” at them, or their own behavior may be labeled as \n“angry” during a tantrum. The phonological form “angry” links together these perceptual \nand behavioral experiences of a child’s own and other people’s anger, in a variety of \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n13 \n \nscenarios (see Lindquist et al., 2015). Emotion words thus act as a catalyst in developing \nacquired equivalence between category members. In support of this position, children’s \nuse of emotion words correlates with behavioral performance in categorising emotions; \nchildren’s increased production of different emotion labels during free labeling \ncorresponds with increasingly differentiated and adult-like categorical perception of \nemotional facial expressions (Widen & Russell, 2003, 2008), and the presence of emotion \nlabels facilitates the categorisation of emotions in childhood (a label superiority effect; \nRussell & Widen, 2002).  \nIn addition to this developmental evidence, it has been suggested that language \ncontinues to contribute to emotion processes in adulthood (Lindquist, 2017). It is argued \nthat cues to another’s emotional state (e.g. a person’s facial expression) are variable and \nambiguous, and that verbal labels act to reduce this ambiguity and therefore assist in \nefficient processing of emotion information (Barrett, Lindquist, & Gendron, 2007; \nLindquist, Barrett, Bliss-Moreau, & Russell, 2006; see also Lindquist, Satpute & \nGendron, 2015, for a review).  \nClearly, under either account, language plays an important role in emotion \nprocesses, and language difficulties would be predicted to disrupt emotional abilities. \nAccording to constructionist accounts, a language deficit may prevent or delay the \ndevelopment of conceptual categories for labeling one’s core affect, and negate the \nadvantageous contextual effects on emotion recognition provided by emotion language in \nadulthood (Lindquist et al., 2006). Within nativist models, a language deficit would leave \nthe innately-endowed discrete basic emotions untouched, but could lead to abnormal \nemotion schemas, leading to poor recognition of one’s own emotions, and emotion \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n14 \n \nregulation difficulties. The notion that alexithymia could be a product of language \ndeficits is therefore in keeping with both nativist and constructionist approaches; the \nalexithymia-language hypothesis does not depend on the adoption of any particular \ntheory of emotion.  \nThe measurement of alexithymia \nOne requirement for research examining the relationship between language ability \nand alexithymia is the careful consideration of how alexithymia should be measured.  \nAlexithymia is usually assessed via self-report questionnaires, which may be problematic \n(Gaigg, Cornell & Bird, 2016). Potential issues with self-report measures are not limited \nto those with language problems. Even for those without language difficulties, highly \nalexithymic individuals may lack insight into their emotion-specific difficulties, causing \nindividuals with alexithymia to fail to identify and report their own deficits. Furthermore, \nit is also possible that those with low alexithymia rate their levels of alexithymia as high, \ndue to low self-esteem or a positively-biased representation of others’ abilities.   \nIn addition to these general concerns, the current self-report measures for \nalexithymia may be particularly problematic for language-impaired samples. First, for \nindividuals with pronounced language difficulties, self-report data may be inaccurate \nunless questionnaires have limited language demands. Second, there is conceptual \noverlap between language and emotional problems in some questionnaire items. For \nexample, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale’s “Difficulty Describing Feelings” subscale \nincludes items such as “It is difficult for me to the find the right words for my feelings”, \nand (the reverse-coded) “I am able to describe my feelings easily” (Taylor et al., 1988). \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n15 \n \nControl items that assess how easily an individual finds it to describe other, non-\nemotional things, or to find other classes of words, would reduce this issue, but are \ncurrently not assessed by self-report alexithymia measures.  \nIn some cases, measurement issues may be overcome by gathering multiple \nsources of information about alexithymia, including parent- or observer-report, but these \napproaches come with their own additional considerations. First, developmental language \nimpairments have been shown to run in families (Bishop, 2006). Thus it is possible that \nparents of children with language impairment also have some language or literacy \ndifficulties. Second, self-report and observer-report measures of alexithymia do not \nalways agree (e.g. Griffin, Lombardo, & Auyeung, 2016). Discrepancies could arise for \nmultiple reasons; some individuals with alexithymia may lack the metacognitive ability \nand insight into their own impairments to rate themselves as having alexithymia, while \nthese problems may be readily apparent to close relatives. Alternatively, given that \nindividuals with alexithymia produce fewer emotional facial expressions, find expressing \nemotions harder and less beneficial, and have more interpersonal problems (Loiselle & \nDawson, 1988; Lumley, 2004; Spitzer, Siebel-Jürges, Barnow, Grabe, & Freyberger, \n2005; Trevisan et al., 2016), parents or partners may lack insight into the emotional \nabilities of the child or spouse.  \nDespite these concerns, self-report measures of alexithymia are highly predictive \nof emotional abilities (Lumley, Neely, & Burger, 2007), suggesting that many individuals \nwith alexithymia do have good insight into their difficulties. It may be the case that self-\nreport measures are more appropriate for some individuals than others. Those with \nparticularly severe language or interoceptive difficulties, for example, may struggle to \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n16 \n \nrecognize and report alexithymic tendencies. The development of objective tests for \nalexithymia is therefore a clear priority for such research with these populations. One \npossibility is that explored by Gaigg et al. (2016); participants’ galvanic skin response \n(GSR) was monitored while participants viewed emotion-inducing stimuli and rated their \nemotional response along a simple scale. Correlations between participants’ GSR and \nemotional ratings were strongly associated with self-reported alexithymia (r = -.57), \nsuggesting that the discrepancy between physiological responses and emotional ratings \nmight provide an alternative measure of alexithymia that is less demanding of verbal \nskills than self-report questionnaires.  \nIn summary, measurement of alexithymia in language-impaired samples currently \nposes a challenge. Potential solutions include: routinely including control items in self-\nreport measures that capture broader linguistic difficulties; gathering observer-report \nalexithymia measures as well as participants’ self-report; and the development and \nvalidation of tests that do not rely on self-report.  \nExisting Evidence for the alexithymia-language hypothesis: Language and \nalexithymia in non-clinical adult samples \nAlthough alexithymia is thought to be a dimensional trait, individuals who score \nabove a clinically-significant cut-off on measures such as the Toronto Alexithymia Scale \n(Taylor et al., 1988) are considered to be alexithymic, and constitute approximately 8-\n10% of the general population in Western samples (Franz et al., 2008; Linden, Wen, & \nPaulhus, 1995; Salminen, Saarijärvi, Äärelä, Toikka, & Kauhanen, 1999). While few in \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n17 \n \nnumber, studies on language abilities in relation to alexithymia in typical adults have \nbeen conducted.  \nSeveral studies report that individuals with alexithymia produce fewer emotion-\nrelated words than those without (Luminet, Rime, Bagby, & Taylor, 2004; Roedema & \nSimons, 1999; Wotschack & Klann-Delius, 2013), although only one study has measured \nthe production of other word categories. This is important, as reduced expression of \nemotion may reflect the fact that those with alexithymia are generally less verbally \nexpressive than those without, rather than specifically less expressive about emotion. The \navailable evidence supports a general reduction in expressivity; individuals with \nalexithymia are also more likely to not respond to non-emotional stimuli. In two studies \nthe difference in the absolute number of emotion words produced by those with \nalexithymia can be accounted for statistically by their total word production (Roedema & \nSimons, 1999; Wotschack & Klann-Delius, 2013). Where differences in the proportion of \nemotion words (rather than just absolute number of emotion words produced) have been \nfound (Luminet et al., 2004), there may nonetheless be other word categories with \nreduced expressivity. Emotion words represent a class of abstract words, which are \ntypically acquired later and show evidence of slower processing than concrete words \n(Schwanenflugel, 1991). Alexithymia may be associated with reduced use of abstract \nwords in general, rather than emotion words specifically, but differences in use of \nabstract words would not be apparent from the coding of the data used in studies thus far.  \nEvidence for a relationship between verbal IQ and alexithymia also suggests that \nverbal abilities may have a mediating role in the association between alexithymia and \npoor performance on emotion-related tasks. Significantly lower verbal IQ scores have \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n18 \n \nbeen reported in those with alexithymia, compared to control participants, and controlling \nfor verbal IQ reduced the effect of alexithymia on processing of emotional facial \nexpressions to non-significance in some cases (Hsing, Mohr, Stansfield, & Preston, 2013; \nMontebarocci, Surcinelli, Rossi, & Baldaro, 2011; see review by Grynberg et al., 2012). \nWeaker verbal IQ may reflect abnormalities in language skills, such as vocabulary, \nsyntactical skills, verbal reasoning, receptive or expressive abilities. However, as no \nstudies have examined the association between alexithymia and specific structural \nlanguage abilities in the general population, the exact nature of this verbal weakness in \nalexithymia remains unclear.  \nExisting evidence for the alexithymia-language hypothesis: Acquired brain injury \nand adult-onset neurodegenerative conditions  \nThe alexithymia-language hypothesis would predict that emotion processes would \nbe detrimentally affected by acquired language disorders. Studying groups such as those \nwho have acquired brain injuries or neurodegenerative conditions may elucidate the \nbiological basis of alexithymia, specifically the potential role of brain regions thought to \nsupport language. Furthermore, evidence from adult populations, with presumably typical \nlanguage and emotional development until the onset of illness or brain trauma, may \nreveal the role of language processes “online” in emotion tasks. That is, if language only \nplays a role in alexithymia during the acquisition of emotion concepts and knowledge – \nand language is no longer necessary to support emotion processing once this knowledge \nhas been acquired – then an acquired language impairment may leave conceptual \nknowledge or emotion schemas intact. If, however, language processes continue to \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n19 \n \ncontribute to emotion processing, then even late-acquired deficits in language should \ndisrupt emotional processes and lead to alexithymia.  \nA straightforward prediction of the alexithymia-language hypothesis would be \nthat aphasia following stroke, in which key language regions suffer damage leading to \nlasting language impairment, would result in impaired emotion processes. Specifically, \nthere should be more severe alexithymia in aphasic compared to non-aphasic stroke \nsurvivors. Although alexithymia has been examined in relation to stroke and suggested to \nbe an important factor in the development of post-stroke depression (Hung, Chou, & Su, \n2015; Spalletta et al., 2001), no research has examined emotion processing abilities in \naphasia following stroke. Instead, patients with aphasic symptoms are commonly \nexcluded from such studies. \nDespite the lack of study of alexithymia in aphasia following stroke, other \nacquired or late-occurring conditions do provide evidence for an association between \nlanguage and alexithymia. This includes evidence from patients with Traumatic Brain \nInjury (TBI). In such samples, verbal measures correlate significantly with alexithymia \ntraits, and verbal abilities differ significantly between groups of TBI patients with and \nwithout alexithymia (Henry et al., 2006; Wood & Williams, 2007). Data from the large \nVietnam Head Injury Study has recently demonstrated that damage to the inferior frontal \ngyrus, a key language region of the brain, is associated with alexithymia (Hobson et al., \n2018). Furthermore, this study demonstrated that patients with naming deficits suffered \nmore severe alexithymia than those with intact naming abilities. This extends findings in \nthe same TBI sample demonstrating a role for the anterior insula, a region considered \ncrucial to interoception, in alexithymia (Hogeveen et al., 2016). Together, these findings \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n20 \n \nsuggest that damage to either interoception-related or language-related brain regions may \ncontribute to alexithymia. However, TBI samples commonly do not have focal lesions, \nbut damage to several areas. Indeed, the proximity of the inferior frontal gyrus to the \nanterior insula makes it difficult to disentangle the role of language disruption (due to \ninferior frontal gyrus damage) from interoceptive failure (caused by anterior insula \ndamage).  \nWhere neurodegenerative conditions are concerned, current data from \nfrontotemporal dementia (FTD) suggest that either interoceptive or language impairments \nmay underpin alexithymia. FTD is usually split into behavioural and language subtypes. \nIn the behavioural variant of FTD (bv-FTD), the presenting difficulties at symptom onset \nare changes in personality, usually including a loss of empathy and emotional blunting. \nThe language variants of FTD include progressive non-fluent aphasia and semantic \ndementia. In progressive non-fluent aphasia, speech becomes non-fluent, containing \ngrammatical errors, and patients’ understanding of complex sentence structures is \ncompromised, although word-level comprehension is usually preserved. In semantic \ndementia, speech is fluent but there is a loss of semantic knowledge, reflected in word-\nfinding difficulties and poor comprehension of previously known words (Bonner, Ash, & \nGrossman, 2010). As well as elevated rates of alexithymia (Sturm & Levenson, 2011), \npatients with FTD exhibit emotional difficulties associated with alexithymia, such as poor \nrecognition of others’ emotions from faces and voices (Keane, Calder, Hodges, & Young, \n2002), and reduced carer-reported empathy (Eslinger, Moore, Anderson, & Grossman, \n2011). These difficulties are considered particularly characteristic of bv-FTD, but \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n21 \n \nemotion processing problems have been observed in all three FTD subtypes (Kumfor & \nPiguet, 2012).  \nWhile alexithymia in FTD has been reported to be elevated relative to controls \n(Sturm & Levenson, 2011), there has been no direct comparison of alexithymia between \nthe different FTD subtypes. However, indirect evidence from emotional difficulties \nassociated with alexithymia supports the idea that different cognitive problems may \nunderpin emotional impairments in the different subtypes. Specifically, we propose that \nemotion impairments are associated with interoceptive abnormalities in bv-FTD, but with \nlanguage difficutlies in semantic dementia. For example, although facial emotion \nrecognition is impaired in both semantic dementia and bv-FTD, controlling for verbal \nability specifically reduces deficits seen in semantic dementia (Miller et al., 2012). \nEmotion word comprehension is impaired in semantic dementia, and correlates with \ncomprehension of non-emotional abstract words, suggesting poor emotion word \nperformance is driven by broader language disability in semantic dementia. These \nemotion word deficits are absent in bv-FTD (Hsieh et al., 2012). Conversely, the profile \nof impairments seen in bv-FTD is more in keeping with an underlying interoceptive \ncause. Interoceptive atypicalities in bv-FTD have been reported, including reduced \nresponses to pain and temperature, feeding dysregulation and eating despite satiety, and \nincreased sugar cravings (Fletcher et al., 2015; Miller, Darby, Swartz, Yener, & Mena, \n1995; Woolley et al., 2007). Furthermore, the anterior insula, a brain region considered \nkey to both interoceptive and emotional processes, has been found to be particularly \naffected in bv-FTD compared to other FTD subtypes (Rosen et al., 2002; Seeley, 2010). \nIndeed, insula degeneration has been linked to interoceptive deficits (Woolley et al., \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n22 \n \n2007) and emotional deficits (Cerami et al., 2014) in FTD. Taken together, these findings \nsuggest that in semantic dementia, emotion processing impairments may be largely \naccounted for by patients’ language difficulties, while in bv-FTD alexithymia may be \nassociated with a more ‘pure’ interoception deficit. Drawing together the evidence from \nTBI patients and language-subtypes of FTD, acquired language disorders appear to affect \nemotional processes in adulthood. This suggests that linguistic processes are not just \nrequired for the development of emotional concepts, but that language continues to \ncontribute to the processing of emotions in adulthood. In addition, the behavioral profiles \nof other adult populations, such as patients with bv-FTD, highlight the fact that \nalexithymic difficulties can occur in the apparent absence of a language problem. \nCollectively, these findings demonstrate that acquired interoceptive and linguistic deficits \nmay each be sufficient to cause increasing levels of alexithymia in adult populations.  \nPopulations of Interest: Language-impairment, hearing-impairment and autism \nThe alexithymia-language hypothesis predicts that language impairment during \ndevelopment will interfere with the acquisition of typical emotional knowledge and \nemotional functioning, and thus predicts developmental associations between language \nand alexithymia, with worse language resulting in more severe alexithymia. Here we \nconsider whether such predictions are borne out by the available developmental evidence, \nincluding studies with autistic1, language-impaired and deaf populations. While there is \nvery little direct evidence relating to the contribution of language impairment to \n                                                 \n1 To respect the wishes of autistic individuals and report the study in line with scientific parlance,  \nwe use language preferred by clinical professionals (e.g., 'individuals with autism’), as well as the term \n‘autistic’, a term endorsed by many individuals with ASD (see Kenny et al., 2016). \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n23 \n \nalexithymia in these populations, the indirect evidence is reviewed here, as these \npopulations are extremely interesting with respect to the alexithymia-language hypothesis \nand should be important foci for future research. The alexithymia-language hypothesis \nhas clear predictions: if emotional development is dependent upon good language ability, \nthen alexithymic traits should characterize all children with developmental language \ndisorder (DLD) (previously known as Specific Language Impairment). In autistic and \ndeaf populations however, language ability is highly heterogeneous. Therefore, if \nlanguage impairment results in alexithymia, then one would expect language ability and \nalexithymia to co-vary in autistic and deaf populations.  \nAlexithymia per se has not been studied directly in language-impaired children, \nalthough cohort studies provide evidence for a link between speech and language delays \nand alexithymia in later life (Karukivi et al., 2012; Kokkonen et al., 2003). Nonetheless, \nmany difficulties common to children with language impairment fit with the notion that \nthese children have alexithymia; children with language impairments show difficulties \nrecognizing facial emotion (Merkenschlager, Amorosa, Kiefl, & Martinius, 2012; Nelson, \nWelsh, Trup, & Greenberg, 2011), difficulties with emotion regulation (Fujiki, Brinton, \n& Clarke, 2002) and social difficulties (Mok, Pickles, Durkin, & Conti-Ramsden, 2014; \nSt Clair, Pickles, Durkin, & Conti-Ramsden, 2011), and are at an increased risk for poor \nmental health outcomes (Beitchman et al., 2001). Thus, the constellation of emotional \ndifficulties reported in DLD is in keeping with higher rates of alexithymia than in the \ntypical population. Indeed, clinicians have suggested that speech and language \nprofessionals ought to consider the impact that language deficits may have on children’s \nemotional processing, with explicit reference to alexithymia as a potential explanation for \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n24 \n \nlinks between poor language and emotional problems (Way, Yelsma, Van Meter, & \nBlack-Pond, 2007).  \nEvidence for the role of language in emotion and alexithymia can also be drawn \nfrom research with deaf children. Deaf or hearing-impaired populations present an \nintriguing opportunity to study the relationships between language development and \nemotion processes. First, while in DLD it is assumed there is some cognitive deficit that \nunderlies the language learning problems, this is not presumed to be the case in deafness. \nSecond, language difficulties are related to early linguistic experience, which varies in the \ndeaf population; there is reduced opportunity for linguistic experience if deaf children are \nborn to hearing families, whereas deaf children born to deaf parents experience rich \nconversational input through sign language from the start of life. Language delay is a key \nfactor in impaired emotion recognition and empathy in hearing-impaired individuals, and \ngroup differences in emotion recognition and empathy between hearing impaired and \ncontrol groups are removed when verbal ability is controlled for (Dyck, Farrugia, \nShochet, & Holmes-Brown, 2004; Netten et al., 2015). There is also evidence, albeit \nlimited, that linguistic input can ameliorate the emotion recognition impairment in this \npopulation (see Dyck & Denver, 2003).  \nReduced linguistic input for some hearing-impaired children thus leads to \nlanguage delay, reducing understanding of others’ emotions. However, language delay \nmay also affect deaf individuals’ ability to recognize and manage their own emotions. \nIndeed, children and adolescents with hearing problems show limited emotion regulation \nstrategies (Rieffe, 2012). No studies have directly examined rates of alexithymia in deaf \npopulations, or the potential role of alexithymia in the emotional processing deficits seen \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n25 \n \nin this group. The profile of emotional difficulties in deaf individuals, however, make a \ncompelling case for investigating the role of alexithymia in emotional difficulties \nexperienced by some deaf individuals. \nThe population that has received the greatest research interest in terms of \nalexithymia is that of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (henceforth autism). The \nprevalence of alexithymia in autism is estimated to be around 50% (Berthoz, Lalanne, \nCrane, & Hill, 2013; Hill, Berthoz, & Frith, 2004). Autism and alexithymia are thus \ndistinct but commonly co-occurring. Previous inconsistent findings regarding emotional \ndeficits in autism, including difficulties with emotion recognition and empathy, may be \nrelated to the high but not universal co-occurrence of alexithymia and autism (Bird & \nCook, 2013; Bird et al., 2010; Brewer, Happe, Cook, & Bird, 2015; Cook et al., 2013; \nOakley, Brewer, Bird, & Catmur, 2016). Language functioning is very heterogeneous in \nautism; some individuals acquire age-appropriate language skills, while a significant \nproportion of autistic individuals remain essentially nonverbal (Howlin, Goode, Hutton, \n& Rutter, 2004; Kjelgaard & Tager-Flusberg, 2001; Tager-Flusberg, Paul, & Lord, 2005).  \nA seemingly straightforward prediction is that alexithymia will be associated with \nthe language status of autistic children, but the wide variation of language skills in autism \nhas yet to be capitalized upon by researchers. Language heterogeneity could contribute to \nthe variability in terms of alexithymia seen in autism, but instead language or verbal IQ \nmore generally is usually considered an extraneous variable to be controlled. Existing \nevidence also relies on less than ideal language measures. As in non-clinical alexithymic \nsamples, participants with autism who also have alexithymia have lower verbal IQ than \nparticipants with autism but without alexithymia, and verbal IQ correlates with \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n26 \n \nalexithymia in the autistic population (although this may have been due to the inclusion \nof individuals with intellectual disability; Milosavljevic et al., 2016). As discussed in \nrelation to alexithymia in the general population, verbal IQ measures alone do not allow \nfor alexithymia to be related to specific language abilities.  \nThe pattern of emotional and social difficulties seen in children with disorders of \nlanguage and communication is consistent with alexithymia playing a mediating role \nbetween poor language and emotional problems, and we predict that future investigation \nwill uncover elevated rates of alexithymia in these groups. There is a clear theoretical \ncase for examining alexithymia across these diverse developmental language-impaired \ngroups. This would allow researchers to tease apart the contribution of specific language \nproblems without known cognitive deficits (deaf children), specific language problems \narising from cognitive deficits (DLD), and language problems in the context of a \ncondition with broader social-communicative problems (autism) to emotion processes. \nIncorporating language into the interoception hypothesis of alexithymia: A multiple \nroute model \nSubstantial evidence exists for a link between interoceptive impairment and \nalexithymia (e.g. Murphy et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2016; Brewer et \nal., 2016; Herbert et al., 2011; Pollatos et al., 2005; Wiens, 2005). Although there has \nbeen limited direct study of the role of language, this review suggests that linguistic \nabilities are also likely to contribute to alexithymia. Given these two rather divergent \nstreams of evidence, determining how they may be combined is likely to contribute to our \nunderstanding of alexithymia.  \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n27 \n \nThe ability to identify and express emotion is a high-level skill that presumably \nrelies on many cognitive processes. The constructionist theory of emotion CAT argues \nthat “core affect” (as it is termed in these theories) is categorized, and that the \ncategorization processes involve language. While interoceptive failure is not explicitly \ndiscussed in CAT, core affect incorporates interoceptive information, and therefore \narguably a failure of interoception is as likely to cause alexithymia as a failure in \ncategorization processes. It thus seems likely that alexithymia may arise through \nimpairment in any one of a number of processes, including interoception and language.  \nWhile the interoception and language hypotheses of alexithymia are not mutually \nexclusive, a ‘multiple routes model of alexithymia’ would need to consider how these \ntwo abilities work together to influence the development of alexithymia. First, \ninteroception and language problems may have additive and independent effects on \nalexithymia, and deficits in either domain may lead to an alexithymic profile at the \nbehavioral level. This would suggest that aetiological subtypes of alexithymia may exist, \nin which either interoception or language is functioning typically. For example, \nalexithymia is elevated in eating disorder populations (Berthoz, Perdereau, Godart, \nCorcos, & Haviland, 2007; Lopez, Stahl, & Tchanturia, 2010), but individuals with \nanorexia nervosa are thought to have generally higher IQ and better scholastic \nachievement than typical individuals, factors highly related to verbal abilities. A language \nimpairment therefore seems relatively unlikely to explain alexithymia in anorexia. \nAlternatively, interoception and language impairment may interact, and thus these \ntwo processes may not be entirely independent. For example, verbal labelling of \nchildren’s states by caregivers during development (e.g. “You must be hungry”, and \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n28 \n \n“You are so tired today”) may refine and tune categorization of interoceptive signals, as \nwell as emotional states (Heyes & Bird, 2007). Poor performance on interoception tasks \nmay thus arise as a downstream consequence of language problems that interfere with the \nprocessing and acquisition of these labels, and the ability to associate them with internal \nstimuli. Indeed, even in adulthood, language processes could continue to contribute to \nonline interoceptive abilities. The ability to recognize a state could depend, to some \nextent, on one’s ability to rapidly verbally label the internal, and contextual, cues \nassociated with that state. Beyond interoception itself, there may be an online role for \nlanguage in tasks assessing interoception; for example, verbal working memory may be \ninvolved in the commonly used heartbeat detection task, while verbally labelling \nrespiratory or muscular effort may aid performance on tasks assessing interoception in \nthese domains (e.g. Murphy, Catmur et al., 2018; Garfinkel et al., 2016).  \nAlternatively, interactive effects between interoception and language may arise if \npoor interoception impacts on a child’s language development. Certainly, an \ninteroceptive impairment may mean that a child’s own internal states are poorly \ndistinguished and therefore an unreliable target for the ascription of verbal labels. Thus, \nimpoverished emotion vocabulary may be a secondary consequence of poor \ninteroception. It is more difficult, however, to explain how poor interoception could lead \nto a general language impairment beyond specifically emotion or interoception-related \nlanguage. Arguably, from a developmental perspective, interoceptive failure could lead to \nsocial abnormalities that reduce or interfere with key language learning experiences (i.e. \ninteroceptive failure may reduce social engagement, and could lead to an individual being \nmore excluded and thus reduce the opportunities for language learning experiences; see \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n29 \n \nQuattrocki & Friston, 2014, and corresponding commentary by Brewer et al., 2015). \nWhile acknowledging the possibility that an interoceptive impairment may result in \nsocial impairments that limit the opportunity for general language learning, it seems more \nlikely that any interaction effect between interoceptive and language impairment is due to \na general language problem impacting the development of accurate interoception, rather \nthan an interoceptive impairment affecting solely emotion and interoceptive-related \nlanguage. \nChallenges to the study of language and alexithymia and outstanding questions for \nfuture research \nThe theories and evidence reviewed here identify a number of opportunities for \nfuture study. In addition, however, reviewing the available literature on linguistic ability \nand alexithymia revealed several challenges to this line of enquiry, including the \nmeasurement issues outlined previously. Further challenges are outlined here.  \nThe finding that alexithymia is elevated in language-impaired groups, or can be \naccounted for in other groups by considering language deficits, leads us to consider how \n“pure” alexithymia should be defined. If a child with language impairment has difficulty \nexpressing themselves generally, a difficulty expressing their emotions is to be expected, \nespecially given that emotions are abstract concepts, which may be particularly reliant on \nlanguage during their acquisition. The same is true of a patient with a neurodegenerative \nillness whose language abilities have deteriorated. These individuals may technically \nscore highly on an alexithymia measure, but should they be considered to have a different \ntype of alexithymia to that which arises due to pure interoceptive failure? Is alexithymia \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n30 \n \nonly “pure” if basic language (and other cognitive) deficits have been accounted for? The \nimplication is that an alexithymia-like behavioral profile may, in some cases, be a \nsecondary consequence of other non-emotion related cognitive decline, and not \ncomparable to alexithymia in the absence of these broader deficits.  \nThis issue of what is “pure” alexithymia may be further illustrated by considering \nchildren who undergo schooling in their non-native language. These children may have a \ngenuine difficulty with language in a certain context, which likely includes difficulty \ncommunicating their emotions (in a sense, a context-specific alexithymia). However, they \nwould have a different cognitive profile to those with generalized language impairment or \ninteroceptive deficits, and under the alexithymia language hypothesis would still be \nexpected to have appropriate emotion concepts, and typical emotion recognition and \nempathy. Under our current conception of alexithymia, we would not regard these \nchildren as being alexithymic, but, as above, agreement needs to be reached with regard \nto what constitutes “pure” alexithymia.   \nThere are also significant methodological challenges when investigating \nalexithymia and its associated cognitive deficits in multiple developmental and clinical \npopulations. Not least is the fact that, in several clinical conditions, language impairment \nis only part of a constellation of cognitive deficits. Research aiming to isolate the specific \ncontribution of language to alexithymia should therefore control for other cognitive \ndeficits that could feasibly contribute to alexithymia. Successfully isolating the \ncontribution of language to alexithymia also requires consideration of the analytical \napproach. Several studies of alexithymia have claimed (e.g. Montebarrocci et al., 2011, \nMiller et al., 2012, Netten et al., 2015), on the basis of Analysis of Covariance \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n31 \n \n(ANCOVA) analyses in which verbal ability or performance on a language task has been \nthe covariate, that differences between groups in terms of alexithymia or associated \nemotional abilities can be accounted for by verbal abilities. However, despite such \napproaches being widespread, the use of ANCOVA to address such questions is \ninappropriate (see Miller & Chapman, 2001). Better approaches include having multiple \ncomparison groups that are matched versus unmatched on verbal abilities and also \nmatched versus unmatched on other cognitive abilities (indeed it is very common in DLD \nresearch to have both a chronological age matched control group and a language age \nmatched control group to control for cognitive and language abilities respectively), or to \nhave a clinical group that can be dissociated on the basis of their language abilities (e.g. \nindividuals with autism with and without accompanying language impairment) in the \nhope that the groups will be otherwise equivalent with respect to cognitive factors other \nthan language. \nOf course, it must be recognized that much of the research on alexithymia to date \nhas been performed in a limited set of cultural contexts. This feature of the existing \nresearch is important, as alexithymia prevalence has been shown to vary across cultures \n(e.g. Zhu et al., 2007; Ryder et al., 2008). While there has been debate about the extent to \nwhich alexithymia can be readily translated into different cultural contexts (see Dere, \nFalk & Ryder, 2012; Fukunishi, Nakagwa, Nakamura, Kikuchi & Takubo, 1997), it has \nbeen argued that alexithymia is present in a comparable form in a variety of cultures \n(Parker, Shaughnessy, Wood, Majeski, Eastabrook, 2005), but that culture-specific tools \nmay be required to assess it. Differences in the prevalence of alexithymia may be \nexpected given cultural variations in the importance placed on emotions or parental \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n32 \n \nsocialization of emotional expression, both of which may contribute to cultural variations \nin alexithymia (Dere et al., 2012; Le, Berenbaum & Raghavan, 2002). As yet, cross-\ncultural research into alexithymia has not considered variations in emotion labels as a \npotential explanation for differences in alexithymia. Variation in emotion terms across \ncultures, and how this does, or does not, impact on emotion perception, has been a central \nissue in the debate between nativist and constructivist theories of emotion (as discussed \nin Section 2.0). One prediction would be that rates of alexithymia over cultures would \npattern with the number of words for emotion in that culture’s language(s). However, any \ninvestigation looking to isolate the effect of emotion lexicon size on alexithymia will also \nneed to control for other cultural factors that may affect alexithymia. Indeed, such \ncultural factors and linguistic factors may not be independent; cultures that place less \nimportance on the sharing of emotion may have fewer words for emotions. Nonetheless, \nresearch into the inter-relationships between culture, language and alexithymia could \nrepresent a way to study the relationship between emotion language and alexithymia, in \nthose for whom typical brain development is assumed. Such research would be \nsignificant for understanding alexithymia, but also has clear relevance to the competing \ntheories of emotion described in this article.  \nAlthough these issues will need consideration, there are currently several \nintriguing lines of enquiry for future research to consider. First, this review has \nhighlighted a number of populations in which the alexithymia-language hypothesis could \nbe tested. In particular, alexithymia has yet to be directly studied in children with DLD, \nor adults with aphasia following stroke. Work with these populations represents a means \nto examine the role of developmental or late-acquired language disruption on alexithymia \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n33 \n \nand emotion processing more broadly. In addition, in exploring the literature on \nneurodegenerative conditions for this review, we noted the increased rates of alexithymia \nin HIV (Bogdanova, Diaz-Santos, & Cronin-Golomb, 2010), multiple sclerosis \n(Prochnow et al., 2011), and Parkinson’s Disease (Costa, Peppe, Carlesimo, Salamone, & \nCaltagirone, 2010). While language has received little study in these conditions, there is \nevidence that language processes are disrupted in multiple sclerosis (Friend et al., 1999; \nLethlean & Murdoch, 1997; Prakash, Snook, Lewis, Motl, & Kramer, 2008) and in HIV \n(Chan, Kandiah, & Chua, 2012; McCabe, Sheard, & Code, 2007; Woods et al., 2006; \nWoods, Moore, Weber, & Grant, 2009). In Parkinson’s Disease, the majority of patients \nhave speech problems, particularly affecting voice and articulation (Ho, Iansek, \nMarigliani, Bradshaw, & Gates, 1999), but these motoric speech-related problems are \narguably quite distinct from the language processes that would be predicted to affect \nemotional functioning. Thus, Parkinson’s Disease may present a useful population to \nwhich those with multiple sclerosis and HIV-related dementia can be contrasted. \nVariation in language functioning, both in the aspects of language that are affected and in \nthe severity of the deterioration, in these conditions represents promising avenues for \nfuture research, offering the potential to test different models of how language and \nalexithymia may be affected in different neurodegenerative diseases.  \nSecond, it will be crucial to understand which distinct aspects of language are \nrelated to alexithymia. Clearly, deficits in emotion-related language must be considered \nin the context of broader language ability, and if alexithymia is associated with some \nform of non-emotional language impairment, then investigation is required into whether \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n34 \n \nthese difficulties extend to all language processes, or only to particular sub-skills, such as \nvocabulary, syntactic skills, pragmatic ability, or abstract language skills. \nThird, the relationship between language and interoception is as yet unclear, and \nthe role language plays in the development of interoception and vice versa remains to be \ndetermined. Indeed, the factors required for the development of interoceptive skill are \nlargely unknown at present. If language is found to shape interoceptive processes, this \nwould contribute to the debate concerning constructivist and nativist accounts of emotion, \nas some nativist accounts argue that interoceptive experiences are innately given (e.g. \nEckman & Cordaro, 2011; Tooby & Cosmides, 2008). Thus, understanding the inter-\nrelationships between alexithymia, interoception and language has implications not just \nfor research on alexithymia and clinical populations, but also emotion theory.  \nSummary \nAlexithymia is a construct that may not be reducible to one basic cognitive deficit \nacross the wide array of populations in which it is observed. It seems not only possible, \nbut probable, that there are multiple routes to the alexithymia phenotype. This review has \nput forward the case for language problems being one potential route to alexithymia, \ndrawing upon competing emotion theories, and evidence from acquired and \ndevelopmental clinical conditions in both children and adults. Alexithymia may be more \nlikely to arise due to interoceptive difficulties in some clinical or developmental groups, \nand due to language difficulties in others. This model clearly requires explicit \ninvestigation, using identical methodologies across a range of populations. The current \nreview highlights key issues around the measurement and conceptual nature of \nLANGUAGE AND ALEXITHYMIA \n35 \n \nalexithymia, but the proposals outlined here generate many testable questions for future \nresearch, including the separate and potentially interacting influences of interoceptive and \nlanguage abilities on the development of alexithymia.  \nFunding Statement/Declaration of Conflicting Interests \nGB is supported by a grant from the Baily Thomas Charitable Fund.
