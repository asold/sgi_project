    "abstract": "Well known reasons for local failures in power transformers are caused by partial discharges (PD) in the electric insulation. Continuous deterioration over time increases the defect which finally can lead to a breakdown of the entire insulation. The importance of PD measurement is accommodated by standardized electrical measurement according to IEC 60270 [1] which is required for acceptance certificates at routine testing. Therefore, the apparent charge QIEC has become an important value for transformer quality. Since a couple of years, alternative measurement methods for PD are used. Originally developed for gas insulated systems [2], [3], ultra high frequency (UHF) measurement found its way into transformer diagnosis over the last years [4]. To become an accepted quality factor, UHF has to be proven a reliable testing method, which can bear up against electrical measurements. Therefore, the general physics of UHF PD has to be considered at first. Ultra-high-frequency antennas measure electromagnetic emissions of PD directly in-oil inside a transformer. It becomes apparent, that UHF measurement usually is advantageous concerning external disturbances. Compared to the electric measurement, the UHF method is robust against external signals [5], which makes it suitable for both, offsite measurement at routine testing under laboratory conditions with low ambient noise and onsite, e.g. after transportation and installation of transformers with usually high noise levels. These considerations make the UHF method interesting as supplement for transformer routine tests. Therefore, a sensor calibration or at least a validation of its sensitivity is required [6] comparable to the electrical measurement. To provide profound knowledge of the equipment, the antenna factor (AF) of the UHF sensor needs to be determined under inside-transformer conditions. This contribution shows the determination of the UHF sensor’s AF using a Gigahertz-Transversal-Electro-Magnetic Setup (GTEM cell). To meet inside-transformer conditions, an oil-filled GTEM cell is required for correct permittivity. Correction factors can then be introduced to minimize measurement errors and to establish better comparability of different UHF sensors. Hence, a standard test setup can be defined.",
