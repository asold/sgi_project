Automated\nsynthesis protocol analysis is attractive for swiftly identifying opportunities\nand informing predictive models, however such applications in heterogeneous\ncatalysis remain limited. In this proof-of-concept, we introduce a transformer\nmodel for this task, exempliﬁed using single-atom heterogeneous catalysts\n(SACs), a rapidly expanding catalyst family. Our model adeptly converts SAC\nprotocols into action sequences, and we use this output to facilitate statistical\ninference of their synthesis trends and applications, potentially expediting\nliterature review and analysis. We demonstrate the model’s adaptability across\ndistinct heterogeneous catalyst families, underscoring its versatility. Finally,\nour study highlights a critical issue: the lack of standardization in reporting\nprotocols hampers machine-reading capabilities. Embracing digital advances\nin catalysis demands a shift in data reporting norms, and to this end, we offer\nguidelines for writing protocols, signiﬁcantly improving machine-readability.\nWe release our model as an open-source web application, inviting a fresh\napproach to accelerate heterogeneous catalysis synthesis planning.\nHeterogeneous catalysis stands at the forefront of developing sus-\ntainable technologies, driving the transition towards carbon-neutral\nchemicals and green energy carriers from renewable feedstocks\n1,2.A t\nits core, catalyst design revolves around exploring and reﬁning\nsynthesis procedures, enabling the creation of unique and tailored\narchitectures with distinct reactivity\n3,4. Catalyst design is often viewed\nas more of an art than a science due to the subtleties in preparation\nmethods introduced by synthetic chemists, ultimately leading to\ndiverse protocols and catalyst formulations found in research articles\nand patents\n5– 8. Despite the empirical nature, the literature review\nserves as the foundational step in designing reaction-speciﬁc catalysts,\nproviding crucial insights into synthesis strategies, suitable active\nsites, supports, and promoters, and preventing the repetition of past\nwork9,10. However, with the ever-growing rate of publications, catalysis\npractitioners face a daunting task of keeping abreast of the latest\ndevelopments in their respectiveﬁelds. This challenge spans from\nidentifying gaps for formulating original research objectives for pro-\njects to drafting grant applications and identifying opportunities for\nintellectual property in patents. Furthermore, traditional literature\nsearches can be highly time-consuming, often spanning several weeks\nor months. This extended duration calls for more efﬁcient methods for\nliterature review and synthesis protocol extraction.\nIn recent years, text mining has gained prominence in automated\ninformation extraction from large corpus of material sciences\n11– 14 and\nReceived: 29 April 2023\nAccepted: 22 November 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zurich, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 1, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland.\n2IBM Research Europe, Säumerstrasse 4, 8803 Rüschlikon, Switzerland.e-mail: teo@zurich.ibm.com; jpr@chem.ethz.ch\nNature Communications|         (2023) 14:7964 1\n1234567890():,;\n1234567890():,;\norganic chemistry15– 18 publications. Notable examples include named\nentity recognition to extract material properties,19– 22 and natural lan-\nguage processing9,15,16,23– 27 and deep learning17,18,28,29 approaches to\ncapture synthesis protocols and store this information in structured\ndatabases that enable collective insights. The emergence of large lan-\nguage models (LLMs), for example, GPT-3 and ChatGPT, claim to have\na disruptive impact on natural sciences and engineering\n30– 32. Generally,\nlanguage models could read hundreds of synthetic procedures and (i)\nexpedite the literature review and foster collective analysis of experi-\nmental data to identify interesting patterns and unexplored areas, (ii)\ngenerate data for training machine learning models to screen reaction-\nspeciﬁc catalysts, and (iii) ultimately, drive computer-assisted synth-\nesis planning and autonomous experiments to accelerate innovation in\ncatalyst discovery and design\n33,34. Despite these promises, the appli-\ncation of text mining and language models in the heterogeneous cat-\nalysis community remains relatively unexplored.\nIn this paper, we introduce a transformer model for the auto-\nmated extraction of synthesis protocols in heterogeneous catalysis,\naiming to streamline the literature review and analysis process. The\nsigniﬁcance of the approach is illustrated by the case of single-atom\nheterogeneous catalysts (SACs), a catalyst family that has garnered\nsubstantial attention in recent years due to their precise atomic-scale\nstructures, high metal utilization, and unique reactivity\n35– 37. A literature\ncomparison reveals that SACs are the fastest-growing family of cata-\nlytic materials (Fig.1a) over the past decade, with a wide range of\nelectro-, thermo-, and photocatalytic applications (Fig.1c). However,\ntheir compositional diversity combined with challenges associated\nwith conﬁrming their properties and the fast-paced exploration of\nsynthetic routes, including wet-chemical, solid-state, gas-phase, and\nhybrid methods\n38– 40 or minor adaptations to existing procedures41– 43\n(Fig. 1b), make it extremely challenging to follow progress.\nBased on a transformer architecture, our model captures details\ncontained within and converts prose descriptions into action\nsequences with associated parameters, covering all steps required for\nreplicating the synthesis (Fig.2). We extend its application to analyze\ntrends in prominent electrocatalytic processes like oxygen and carbon\ndioxide reduction reactions. Beyond SACs, our model is adaptable,\noffering accurate predictions for other prominent families of catalytic\nmaterials. Its potential to reduce literature analysis times signiﬁcantly\nunderscores its value. However, our analysis highlights the critical\nissue of non-standardized synthesis reporting on text mining efﬁ-\nciency. To address this, we propose guidelines for machine-readable\nsynthesis procedures. By comparing the model on original and\nguideline-modiﬁed protocols, we observe a signiﬁcant performance\nenhancement, demonstrating the value of protocol standardization as\na key enabler to accelerate synthesis planning in heterogeneous\ncatalysis.\nResults\nAnnotation and extraction of synthesis actions\nIn our study, we targeted reviewing SAC literature from when the term\nwas introduced in 2010 to 2021, identifying nearly 1200 papers.

We focused on experimental papers,\nfrom which we manually reviewed 145 publications, aiming to analyze\nthe trends in synthetic routes investigated across various thermo-,\nelectro-, and photochemical reactions (Supplementary Note 1).\nSynthesis routes of SACs typically encompass various steps, such as\nmixing, wet deposition, pyrolysis,ﬁltering, washing, and annealing.\nConventionally, these procedures are reported within the“Methods”\nsections of scientiﬁc articles as unstructured natural language-based\ntextual descriptions. Our goal was to extract all relevant synthesis\nsteps, related conditions, and the resulting material compositions into\na structured format, as exempliﬁed in Fig.3a. To facilitate our analysis,\nwe deﬁned the synthesis of SACs as the process starting from the metal\nprecursor and carrier or carrier precursor and continuing until a cat-\nalytic material containing single atoms stabilized on a support is\nobtained. Using this deﬁnition, we classiﬁed the reported synthetic\napproaches into eight categories and an additional post-synthetic\ntreatment step (Supplementary Table 1).\nTo develop a framework for extracting and analyzing this infor-\nmation, we initially identify the most commonly used synthetic steps\nthat could later be used as action terms for annotation purposes\n(Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Table 2). We further analyzed\nthe frequency of occurrence of synthetic steps in the same subset of\n145 publications through manual analysis. Each step involves several\nrelevant parameters, such as the temperature, temperature ramp,\natmosphere, and duration in the case of pyrolysis. These details need\nto be clearly deﬁn e da n dc a nb ec u s t o m i z e dd e p e n d i n go nt h e\nrequired level of detail. Thus, all such synthetic steps and essential\nparameters necessary to replicate the experiments were identiﬁed and\nlabeled as action terms (Supplementary Table 3).\nThe action terms were then used to manually annotate a ran-\ndomized subset of 127 synthesis paragraphs (approximately 25% of\nthe total paragraphs compiled) comprising 936 sentences. The\nannotation was performed on the dedicated software, as shown in\nFig. 3b. (see “Methods” for details). Using this set of annotated\nparagraphs, and combining it with previously annotated set for\norganic synthesis,\n17 we ﬁne-tuned a pretrained transformer model17\nto devise our ACE (sAC transformEr) model, which translates full-\nlength unstructured sentences from entire paragraphs into a struc-\ntured, machine-readable sequence of information (see“Methods”\nfor details and Supplementary Note 3). We evaluated theﬁdelity of\nour model based on metrics such as the Levenshtein similarity\nand BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores. With an\noverall Levenshtein similarity of 0.66, our ACE model can capture\nand extract approximately 66% of information from synthesis\nprotocols into correct action sequences, while a BLEU score of 52\nattests to the high-quality translation of synthesis sentences\nfrom natural language into machine-readable formats (Supplemen-\ntary Note 4)\nTo maximize the potential of this language model for automated\nextraction of synthetic protocols, we wanted to make it easily acces-\nsible to a broad audience and, more speci ﬁcally, experimental\nresearchers. For this purpose, we developed a web application and\nopen-sourced it at synthesis_protocol_extraction. Synthetic and com-\nputational researchers can easily access this tool, requiring no prior\np r o g r a m m i n go rc o d i n ge x p e r i e n c e .\nAnalysis\nSynthesis conditions Model transferability Protocol guidelines\nModelling\nData split Deep learning Performance\nAnnotation\nAction terms Customizable\nData collection\nDatabase search Experimental reports Publisher access rights Synthesis paragraphs\nGeneralization\nSearch  Engine\nPublisher approved\nApplication trends\nFig. 2 | Approach to text mining SAC literature.A literature search identiﬁed\narticles on SACs published between 2010-2021, followed by manual classiﬁcation of\nexperimental reports. Relevant papers were sourced with permission from various\npublishers in json or txt format. To conﬁgure the annotation framework, 127\nsynthesis paragraphs containing 936 sentences were manually annotated with 33\naction terms deﬁned in this study. Post annotation, the 936 sentences were split\ninto training, validation, and test split (80:10:10), and the ACE model was developed\nuntil achieving acceptable performance. Analysis of the data extracted by the\nmodel provides insights into synthesis and application trends. Extension of the\nmodel to other families of heterogeneous catalysts demonstrates its transferability,\nand guidelines for the standardization of synthesis protocols set the path for\nfacilitating future text mining endeavors.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43836-5\nNature Communications|         (2023) 14:7964 3\nAccelerating literature analysis and synthesis insights\nThe ACE model serves the dual purpose of synthetic protocol text\nmining and collective analysis of this literature data to reveal interesting\npatterns. As such, this model servesas an invaluable tool to catalysis\npractitioners as it expedites literature review practice, which is often\nroutine, tedious, and time-intensive. We estimate the time spent on one\nsingle paper and for collecting details on the metal speciation, compo-\nsition, synthetic route, and reaction types by a SAC researcher to be\napproximately 30 min without any help and under 1 min with our ACE\nmodel. Scaling this effort to 1000 publications would cumulatively result\nin a minimum of 500 man-hours in an ideal case scenario, while text\nmining these publications by the ACE model would take a mere 6– 8h( a\nset of 300 papers were text mined in less than 2 h for quantiﬁcation)\noffering over 50-fold reduction in thet i m ei n v e s t e df o rliterature ana-\nlysis- and thus demonstrating the true worth of language models.\nThe results of our analysis on the synthesis of SACs complement\nexisting domain knowledge, thereby instilling greater conﬁdence in\nthe model output. By applying topic queries to articles reporting SACs\nfor the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and CO\n2 reduction reaction\n(CO2RR), applications accounting for approximately one-third of the\nreports in our database, we identiﬁed the most frequently used metals\nand metal precursors, carrier materials, and solvents (Fig.4a, b). Our\nanalysis revealed that Fe is one of the most commonly investigated\nmetals for the ORR reaction, with Fe-based precursors typically\ninvolving chlorides or nitrates. The modelﬁndings also revealed that\ncarbons derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8) are a\npopular choice for carrier materials in ORR applications due to their\nhigh surface areas, microporous structures, chemical and thermal\nstabilities, and synthesis controllability, with ZIF-8 synthesized from\n2-methylimidazole and Zn(NO\n3)2 via solvothermal and solvent meth-\nods being prevalent. The analysis also provides valuable insights into\nthe temperatures applied during thermal treatments in SAC synthesis,\nfor example, pyrolysis, annealing, and reductive treatments (Fig.4c). A\nbroad range of temperatures are used in all cases, but distinct peaks\nare observed. These are typically around 1173 K for annealing and\npyrolysis steps. Reduction treatments usually activate the catalyst at\nlower temperatures (373– 423 K). For SACs subjected to heat treat-\nment, two distinct peaks are observed, where the evidenced distribu-\ntion at lower temperatures could plausibly account for instances\nwhere the catalyst was subjected to heat treatment (573– 623 K), post\nthe metal stabilization on the carrier.\nThough the above enterprise presents valuable information to\nsynthesis experts for informed decision-making during the experi-\nmental planning stages, we realize that the seamless automation of\ntext-mined synthetic protocols to create comprehensive SAC reposi-\ntories or databases is far from realization and requires extensive\nmanual intervention. We highlight and attribute this limitation to the\nabsence of uniform data presentation and lack of standards in writing\nprotocols\n6,44,45. This discrepancy consumes valuable time and intro-\nduces the risk of misinterpretation and inaccuracies in the process. For\nexample, we observe that the commonly used solvent ethanol is\nreferred to using various terminologies such as‘ethanol,’‘ C\n2H5OH,’\n‘EtOH,’ and ‘EOH’ in different publications. While human researchers\ncan recognize these variations as referring to the same chemical entity,\nText to procedure\n1.

This issue\nbecomes increasingly complex when dealing with multiple such pre-\ncursors, solvents, and associated chemicals presented under various\nnomenclatures. Similarly, we notice that the term‘heating’ is synony-\nmously used for pyrolysis, carbonization, or annealing, thereby ren-\ndering challenges for the model to determine the appropriate thermal-\ntreatment method. Developing a language model capable of accu-\nrately identifying and accounting for all such chemical entities and unit\noperations is formidable. In light of these challenges, we emphasize\nthe critical importance of data standardization in scientiﬁc publica-\ntions. Only through enhanced data uniformity can we pave the way for\nbroader applications of language models in chemistry and catalysis-\nrelated tasks, thereby advancing interdisciplinary research and inno-\nvation in theseﬁelds.\nModel adaptability and limitations\nVisualizing the data extracted by the model sheds valuable insights into\nthe unit operations related to synthesis across publications. Ourﬁndings\nreveal a close alignment between the distribution of action terms pre-\ndicted by the ACE model and the annotated synthesis steps, also referred\nto as ground truth (Fig.5a). Notably, the ACE model demonstrates a\nremarkable accuracy in predicting action terms such as ThermalTreat-\nment, SynthesisProduct, Centrifuge, Transfer, etc. Furthermore, we note\nthe recurrent presence of action terms such as Add, Stir, MakeSolution,\nThermalTreatment, DrySolid, Wash, and Concentrate, etc., in the dis-\ntribution list. This observation aligns with our initialmanual analysis,\nw h e r ew es t a t i s t i c a l l yi n f e r r e dt h ep r e d o m i n a n c eo fs o l u t i o n - p h a s ea n d\nhigh-temperature procedures and their hybrid forms in SAC synthesis,\nand these encompass the aforementioned action terms. This, in turn,\ndemonstrates the model’s prediction prowess.\nHere, we rationalize that since the ACE model is purely data-driven\nand effectively identiﬁes action steps related to solution-phase and\nhigh-temperature synthesis methods, its predictive capabilities should\nnot be limited to SAC protocols. Instead, it has the potential to be\nadapted for a broader category of heterogeneous catalysts that are\nprepared by similar synthetic routes. Within heterogeneous catalyst\nresearch, supported mono-, bimetallic, and promoted systems are\namongst the most investigated materials, often prepared using wet-\nchemistry techniques like precipitation, impregnation, and sol-gel\nmethods, among others. Extending the model’s application to extract\nsynthetic protocols of these catalysts would prove its ability to gen-\neralize across various catalyst types.\nTo test this hypothesis, we selected a randomized subset of\n18 synthesis paragraphs from the literature on a few prominent reac-\ntions, including CO\n2 hydrogenation, acetylene hydrochlorination, and\nFischer-Tropsch synthesis. These paragraphs were subjected to the\nACE model prediction, resulting in 202 action sequences (Supple-\nmentary Note 6). To determine the model accuracy, we devised a\nsimple yet effective evaluation metric, termed human machine-\nreadability index (HMI) (see Methods for details). Here, we observed\nthat of the total sample size, the ACE model could predict 125 actions\ncorrectly, inclusive of all essential information, 28 sentences were\npartially correct, while 49 sentences were predicted wrongly, resulting\nin the HMI of 69%. (Fig.5b) To put into context, this inferred that the\nmodel could extract approximately 69% of information from the\nevaluated paragraphs, implying that it could generalize and extract\nsynthesis details with accuracies similar to SAC synthesis as described\nin the earlier section. Theseﬁndings quantitatively prove that the ACE\nmodel can be extended to extract operations from texts of other\nfamilies of heterogeneous catalysts with minimal training data or the\n0\n300\n600\n900\n1200\n1500T ( K)\nAnnealing Heating Pyrolysis Reduction\nCO2RR\nORR CO2RR\na\nc\nCO2RR\nFeCl3\nFe(NO3)3\nCo(NO3)2\nFe(Cl)2\nFe(SO)4\nFe(Ac)3\nCo(Cl)2\nCo(Ac)2\nNi(NO3)2\nNi(Cl)2\nNi(Ac)2\nFe3O4\nFe(NO3)3\nFe(SO)4\nb\nEtOH Other  H2O MeOH\n2-MeIM Zn(NO3)2 ZIF-8  Melamine\nMeOH EtOHH2O\n 2-MeIM Zn(NO 3)2 ZIF-8\nFe precursor Co precursor Ni precursorNi precursor Solvent Carrier precursor\n Melamine\nOther\nFig. 4 | ACE-derived synthesis landscape of SAC literature.Overview of the most\nfrequently reporteda metal precursors andb carriers and solvents in SACs\ndeveloped for ORR (blue rectangles) or CO2RR (gray rectangles) identiﬁed by\nmachine-reading of the complete dataset.

For instance, when the model encounters a synthetic protocol\nwhere the catalysts are prepared with different metal contents or\nactivated at different temperatures, where all the experimental details\nare written in parenthesis, the model typically retrieves one of the\ngiven values or assigns an arbitrary value to the respective action term.\nFurthermore, the predictive prowess of the model is inherently com-\npromised on encountering less standard synthesis protocols, for\nexample, gas-phase or electrochemical. Based on the model predic-\ntion, it is evident that essential procedures like plasma treatment and\nconﬁguration of the plasma chamber for gas-phase and details\nincluding type of electrodes, calibrations, and cycles for electro are\ncurrently not well captured. The poor generalization is primarily due to\nthe absence of these steps as action terms due to the scarcity of these\nmethods in the training set of paragraphs for annotation. This is a\nsigniﬁcant limitation to bear in mind when using the model for pre-\ndiction or extraction in these areas. Nevertheless, we believe that\ncurating action terms speciﬁc to these routes and supplementing the\nmodel training with these potential new terms will scale its accuracy\nproportionately.\nImproving machine-readability through protocol\nstandardization\nExamination of the incorrect predictions of the ACE model reveals that\nthe errors are often minor, involving the omission of one or two action\nterms. These errors are frequently acceptable alternatives to the\nground truth. To improve the model performance, we propose two\nsystematic approaches. First, we recommend increased annotation of\nsynthesis paragraphs followed by model retraining and the addition of\nnew annotation terms corresponding to synthesis steps where the\nmodel is least conﬁdent. Second, we advocate for standardizing the\nway synthesis protocols and experimental results are reported in lit-\nerature to facilitate efﬁcient text mining and automated data analysis.\nTowards this goal, we offer eight guidelines to standardize synthesis\nparagraph writing (Fig.6a, b).\n(i) Publishers and journals should require detailed synthesis proto-\ncols as Supplementary Information to free authors from word\nlimits and (self-)plagiarism constraints, allowing for more\naccurate descriptions, which would improve synthetic reprodu-\ncibility and model training. (ii) Chemical composition and tar-\ngeted properties (e.g., metal nuclearity in supported metal\ncatalysts) of synthesized catalysts the procedure used to prepare\nthem should be explicitly mentioned to ensure accurate correla-\ntion of synthesis details with samples.\n(ii) Supplier details and grade of all chemicals used in the study\nshould be given in a uniform format. For our model, providing\nthem as a single sentence at the beginning of the paragraph rather\nthan listing them at theﬁrst occurrence of the chemical entity\nimproves the performance.\n(iii) Specify exact quantities of chemicals rather than writing mathe-\nmatical expressions in ratios will improve machine readability,\nwhich would otherwise require the development of speciﬁc cal-\nculations to decode the formulation, entailing separate\nchallenges.\n(iv) Keep protocols concise, excluding elaborated discussion of\nchoices of synthetic steps. Additionally, separate descriptions of\ncharacterization techniques from synthesis paragraphs.\n(v) Provide details on all samples reported rather than focusing on\nthe best-performing catalyst. If multiple samples, for example of\ndistinct composition, are prepared following the same synthetic\nprocedure, we propose that such details and the speciation of\nthese SACs be separately listed in a tabular format after the\nsynthesis paragraphs.\n(vi) Use standardized terms for synthesis steps and catalyst vocabu-\nlary. This requires more effort from the scientiﬁc community to\ndevelop and adopt standardized deﬁnitions.\n(vii) Publish all synthesis-related datasets with every manuscript for\ntransparency and reproducibility.\nWe performed a demonstration test to evaluate our premise\nthat protocol standardization can improve machine-readability\n(Supplementary Note 8). From the pool of SAC literature compiled\nin this study, we randomly selected 11 paragraphs, where the SACs\nwere prepared by wet-chemistry routes and labeled them as pristine\nparagraphs. Subjecting these paragraphs to the ACE model resulted\nin 151 action sequences, where we observed fully correct and par-\ntially correct predictions on 99 and 19 actions, respectively, while 33\nwere predicted incorrectly, resulting in an HMI of 72%. We then\nmodiﬁed the pristine paragraphs to comply with theﬁrst ﬁve pro-\nposed guidelines, which are straightforward to implement, and\ntermed them as standardized paragraphs. On assessing the model\non these paragraphs, 156 actions sequences were generated, com-\nparable to the pristine action set.

This, in\nturn, resulted in an HMI of 86% - a signiﬁcant 14% increase compared\nto the pristine counterpart (Fig. 6c). It is worth mentioning, in\ncomparison to increasing training set size or synthetic data aug-\nmentation as discussed in the earlier section, where we notice\nmeager increments in model performance (c.a. 2– 3%) under various\nscenarios, data standardization offers a more promising alternative\nto improve model ﬁdelity and machine-readability. More impor-\ntantly, as a proof-of-concept, we successfully demonstrate the sig-\nniﬁcance of protocol standardization and its indispensable role in\nmachine-reading and NLP-related tasks in chemistry and catalysis.\nThe guidelines proposed for protocol standardization are not\nlimited to the above cause but can be conveniently translated to\nmanage data in heterogeneous catalysis as per the FAIR (Findable,\nAccessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles\n44,46. For instance, in\naddition to the synthesis protocols being written in the Supplementary\nInformation, authors can also submit the same in online repositories\nfor easier and enhanced accessibility. Along with the metadata of the\nprotocols including, but not limited to who, when, and where the\nsynthesis was performed, details on the supplier and grade of the\nchemicals and equipment or reactors used during synthesis will allow\nfor greater reproducibility of the protocols complying with FAIR\nprinciples. An alternative to online repositories would be to list the\ndetails of the synthesis protocols, including catalyst properties and\nsynthesis approach, quantities of precursors, solvents, and supports,\nand the respective unit operations in a succinct manner in Excel sheets\nor customized electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) in tabular formats,\nsuch that all the above information are efﬁciently managed through\nthe life-cycle of the project. These synthesis datasets should be pub-\nlished with every manuscript. Furthermore, details of similar proce-\ndures could be seamlessly listed in tabular formats within ELNs,\nmaking data interoperable. Here we highlight that the objective of\nprotocol standardization by no means intends to limit the creativity of\nthe experimental researcher, but rather encourage scientiﬁcw r i t i n g\nand data reporting practices, so that it can be translated to meet the\nrequirements of text mining approaches. Another forward looking\nalternative would be to write synthesis procedures as a sequence of\nactions rather than plain texts. We believe, such practices if fostered,\nwould encourage experimentalists to list procedures in the correct\nsequence of actions, along with all necessary details essential to\nreplicate the experiment. Such formats would not only beneﬁtt h e\nexperimental community, but also be greatly advantageous for text\nmining and language models endeavors. Overall, through such pro-\ntocol and data reporting standardization efforts, which inadvertently\nimproves the quality of data, we anticipate text mining approaches, be\nit natural language processing, association rule learning, sequential\npattern mining, pattern tracking, etc., to effectively work with small\ndatasets and minimal training, ultimately leading to their greater\nacceptance is chemistry and catalysis research.\nDiscussion\nOur study demonstrates the tremendous potential of transformer\nmodels to extract synthesis actions from heterogeneously catalyzed\nexperimental procedures. These tools pave the way for data-driven\ndesign and guided synthesis of application-speciﬁc heterogeneous\ncatalysts. Importantly, this methodology is not restricted to a speciﬁc\nclass of catalyst, as demonstrated through various examples. While\ntext mining and automated data collection in catalysis offer immense\npotential for driving the concepts of autonomous and robotic\nexperiments, existing limitations arising from the lack of standardi-\nzation in reporting synthetic protocols must be addressed. Based on\nthe outcome of this study, we believe that current literature may not be\nsufﬁciently ready to capitalize on all the beneﬁts of language models\nand machine learning tools.\nFor the catalysis community to fully beneﬁt from the rapidly\nevolving data-driven technologies, signiﬁcant efforts must be directed\ntoward data collection, curation, and reporting practices. While these\nendeavors can be initiated with individual research groups, their global\nawareness and adoption will be only possible through community\nefforts led by national and international initiatives, including research\ndata management and standardization. Furthermore, as language\nmodels become increasingly prominent, text mining in catalysis\nshould be a collaborative endeavor involving researchers developing\ncatalytic materials and experts in deep learning algorithms and text\nmining pipelines. This partnership will drive the emergence of novel\nconcepts for digitized experiments. With improvements in language\nmodels and developments that enable reporting synthesis protocols in\nstandardized and machine-readable formats, we envision the rapid\ngrowth of automated synthesis and data-driven discovery of catalysts,\npromising an exciting new era of discoveries in catalysis and chemistry.\nAs a follow-up to this study, we aim to make the ACE model generative\nin nature. To accomplish this goal, we plan to standardize published\nparagraphs based on the guidelines provided in this study via prompt\nengineering in GPT-4, followed by retraining of our ACE model on the\nmodiﬁed paragraphs.\nMethods\nArticle collection\nA comprehensive screening of SAC literature was performed in Web of\nScience and Scopus for the data collection process. This was done\nthrough keyword search, including terms such as (“single-atom cata-\nlyst” AND “electrocatalytic OR“thermocatalytic” OR “photocatalytic”\nOR “organic reactions”)a n d(“SAC” AND “electrocatalytic OR“ther-\nmocatalytic” OR “photocatalytic” OR “organic reactions”)d u r i n gt h e\nperiod 2010– 2021. The keyword search returned over 1200 works,\nincluding experimental, computational, and review articles on the\ntopic. Since the main essence was to develop a text mining protocol\nspeciﬁc to the synthesis procedures, the purely computational and\nreview papers were discarded. At the same time, experimental works\nwere retained, bringing the effective collection to 569 articles. The\nmajor publishers, including American Chemical Society (ACS), Royal\nSociety of Chemistry (RSC), Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley, accounted\nfor 97% of the publications. With support from the ETH library,\nappropriate agreements were signed with all the publishers to ensure\nfreedom of text and data mining on these published articles and open\naccess to the data extracted from the reports. The papers were pro-\ncured in electronic formats such as json, html, or txt.\nStatistical analysis of synthesis methods\nBased on the data compiled, a descriptive analysis to quantify various\nsynthesis methods and the application of SAC across thermo-, electro-,\nor photocatalytic applications was performed on randomly selected\n145 publications. The diverse synthesis methods were categorized into\neight classes with an additional post-treatment step based on literature\ndescription and domain expertise (Supplementary Table 1).\nAnnotation\nAnnotation is the process of assigning meaning to natural language\ntext, which can apply to short phrases, long sentences, or entire\nparagraphs. It provides the AI model with essential information to\nlearn the meaning or context of the text\n11. Text annotation parallels the\ndata labeling procedure in classical machine learning, as this infor-\nmation is used to train the model and accurately interpret the text\nunder consideration. Herein, 33 action terms were utilized for anno-\ntation, 27 of which were identiﬁed based on the most frequent action\nitems in wet-chemistry labs,\n17 and 6 catered to synthesis protocols\nwritten in the heterogeneous catalysis community (Supplementary\nTables 2, 3). Onceﬁnalized, each sentence in the synthesis paragraph\nwas manually annotated using these action terms on the modular\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43836-5\nNature Communications|         (2023) 14:7964 8\nannotation framework based on the open-source tool doccano (Sup-\nplementary Table 4). Details on the working philosophy of this tool are\ndescribed elsewhere\n17,47. Brieﬂy, doccano offers a user-friendly web\ninterface, which allows the annotator/user to add, edit, reorder, and\nconﬁrm action steps on each of the sentences from the experimental\nprocedures that appear on the front screen. This tool also has a cus-\ntomizable backend, offering greaterﬂexibility for developers to add,\nedit, and delete action terms relevant to the project scope. In this\nstudy, 127 paragraphs, including 936 sentences, were manually anno-\ntated, and an annotation guideline was developed to ensure con-\nsistency throughout the study.\nTransformer model\nThe ACE model developed for translating experimental protocols to\naction steps was based on the transformer architecture\n48. The algo-\nrithm relies on the transformer encoder-decoder architecture, which\ncreates a latent vectorized representation of texts, and its‘attention’\nfunctionality facilitates recognition of the essential and core parts of a\nsequence necessary for comprehending the textual meaning. The ACE\nmodel was developed by transfer-learning from a previously reported\nmodel,\n17 by ﬁne-tuning the pretrained model on a set of 936 annotated\nsentences compiled from 127 SAC synthesis paragraphs and 2295\nannotated sentences from the realm of organic chemistry17.\nThe ACE model is implemented using the OpenNMT-py library49\nwith speciﬁc architecture, implementation, and hyperparameters\n(Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Tables 5, 6). The entire dataset\nof 3231 annotated sentences was split into 80:10:10 ratios and labeled\nas training, validation, and test sets, respectively. The training-\nvalidation-test split was carried out in a randomized manner at the\nsentence level through the following steps. First, the number of sen-\ntences assigned to the train, validation, and test sets were determined\nb a s e do nt h ed e s i r e ds i z e s( a sap e r c e n t a g eo ft h et o t a l ) .S e c o n d ,t h e\nfull set of sentences and associated annotations were shufﬂed, ran-\ndomizing their order. Third, the shufﬂed dataset was split into three\ncontiguous subsets of the desired sizes for the respective splits. Fur-\nthermore, the model was progressively evaluated on 25%, 50%, 75%,\nand 100% of the total annotated data to evaluate the effect of data size\non performance. The effect of data augmentation was also examined,\nwhere the size of the above-annotated sets was synthetically increased\nby 10-fold. (Supplementary Note 4). For reference, a 10-fold augmen-\ntation on 100% of the training data corresponds to 25820 synthetically\ngenerated sentences with annotation\n17.T h em o d e lw a st r a i n e df o r\n20,000 steps in all cases, and checkpoints were saved every\n1000 steps. The model checkpoint leading to the highest accuracy in\nthe validation set was selected for analysis.\nPerformance metrics\nThis study used various performance metrics, including the BLEU\n(Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), Levenshtein score, and the human\nmachine-readability index (HMI). The BLEU score is a metric for eval-\nuating machine-translated text, where values of 40-50 infer high-\nquality translations. At the same time, those below 25 imply poor\ntranslation and are not recommended\n48,50 The Levenshtein score cal-\nculates the similarity index between the synthesis procedure in the\nactual paragraph and the action sequence predicted by the model\n17.\nThus, the 100% accuracy refers to the fraction of sentences wherein the\nentire action sequence was predicted correctly, along with the\nrespective properties. Though these metrics are conventional for NLP\ntasks, their inherent limitation is the need for annotation on the\nselected paragraphs under investigation, as generating such annotated\ndatasets is usually time- and resource-intensive and may not be feasible\nin all cases. Moreover, the various synthesis-related parameters\nextracted by the model, necessitate validation, best performed\nthrough domain knowledge. However, currently, this scope is limited\nby the aforementioned metrics.\nTo address these challenges, we developed an effective metric,\nHMI, which brings forth the human factor in evaluating these model\npredictions. Brieﬂy, a human expert manually checks the synthesis\nparagraphs and the corresponding sequence actions predicted by the\nACE model and grades the output depending on its accuracy as\ndescribed in Eq.1.\nHMI =\nIð0Þ + PCð0:5Þ + Cð1Þ\nAT\n*100 ð1Þ\nwhere, I = incorrect actions PC = partially correct actions C = correct\nactions AT = total actions\nThe model is graded as per the HMI score in the following manner:\n If the model predicts the correct action terms and extracts the\ncorresponding material properties or unit operation values, it\ngets a full score of 1.\n If the model predicts the correct action term, but extracts\nincorrect material properties or unit operation values, then it\ngets a score of 0.5.\n If the model predicts an action term incorrectly, it gets a\nscore of 0.\nFor example, if the output of a typical SAC synthesis paragraph\nresults in a sequence of 10 action terms withﬁve correct, two par-\ntially correct, and three incorrect predictions, this results in an\nHMI of 60%.\nData availability\nThe curated dataset compiled in this study is open-sourced and\ndeposited at Zenodo ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10033139).\nWe released an open-source web application of our ACE model at\nsynthesis_protocol_extraction.
