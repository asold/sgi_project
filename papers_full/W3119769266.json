INTRODUCTION\nENEWABLE energy is gaining momentum in bulk \ngeneration of electricity [1], despite of the fact that \ntraditional gas and oil are still dominate [2]. With about \n2/3 of the total global investment going to solar and wind \nenergy, renewables are also projected to surpass coal in less \nthan a decade as the price for wind and solar gains price parity \nor even lower in price than coal [3]. One of the salient features \nof the wind and solar PV power is its intermittent nature of \nenergy availability, particularly when it comes to connect \nthese renewables to a power grid. A structured microgrid \n(SµG) is a natural vehicle to integrate all forms of renewables \ninto an autonomous subsystem or/then system [4]. \nFor grid deployment of ren ewables, SµGs provide benefits \nbeyond integration. It can provide a whole slew of benefits \nsuch as demand response, energy storage as spinning reserve, \nancillary support in addition to bulk generation and \nDon Tan  is Steering Committee Chair for IEEE eGrid Workshop jointly \nsponsored by Power Electronics Society (PELS) and Power and Energy \nSociety (PES).

SµGs are also powerful in turning \ncommon back-up generator s ets from idle to active assets for \nrevenue generation.  It can also act as a basic building block \nfor a modern electronic grid, as envisioned in [9], where six \nbasic characteristics of a modern grid are discussed in detail.  \nDespite of their many advantages and because of the required \nhigh reliability for electricity, SµGs are still facing certain \nchallenges, particularly in first cost, uncertainty about life cost, \nlack of adequate availability of system integrators, and \nregulatory barriers [14]. As a result, utilities are still currently \nreluctant to fully embracing SµGs [15].  \nFlexible electronic large power transformers (FeLPTs) are \nemerging as the key equipment t o fully realize the benefits of \nrenewables and SµGs. It is a class of electronic power \ntransformers that focus on renewable integration and \nflexibility in transmission [16] -[19]. FeLPT is a general term \nused to describe electronic power transformers at meg awatts \nlevels for typical grid and traction applications. Other terms \nused include Smart Transformers, Power Electronic \nTransformer, Solid-State Transformers, etc. \nThis paper attempts to present the case of SµGs and \nFeLPTs together as twin technologies to enable renewable \nintegration and flexible transmission. Section II reviews the \ndefinition of structured microgrids and the local benefits to the \nowner and global benefits to the next -higher level power sub -\ngrids or grids. Sect ion III summarizes the basic roles and \ncapabilities that storage and active control play in microgrids \nand in power grids. Section IV discusses the issue of life-cycle \ncost can be significantly le ss for a microgrid owner. The first \ncost associated with a microgrid deployment can be offset by \nreduction in operational cost. Section V presents a summary \nof 10 top applications for SµGs, together with one example \nfor the SµGs to triple the transmission capacity by 300% \nwithout having to increase the transmission or distribution line \ncapacity, proving hence that SµGs are ultimate grid assets for \nany utilities to own and operate. Section VI puts forward the \nstate of the art and the challenges for FeLPTs. Finally, we \npresent conclusions and relevant references.  \nII. S\nTRUCTURED MICROGRIDS\nMicrogrids have emerged as natural vehicles for integration \nof renewables into a systems or a subsystem with multi - \nphysics. Among the many types of microgrids, structured \nmicrogrids (SµGs) are powerful, flexible and easily scalable. \nThe concept of SµGs was first introduced in 2015 [3]. It is \nrecaptured here for easy reference. \nDefinition: A structured microgrid, dc, ac, or a hybrid of dc \nand ac, is an integrated autonomous, multi -physics energy \nStructured Microgrids (SµGs) and Flexible \nElectronic Large Power Transformers (FeLPTs) \nDon Tan, Fellow, IEEE \n (Invited) \nR\nEarly versions appeared in the opening keynotes at \nAPSCOM 2018 and e\nGrid 2019, respectively\n2096-3564 © 2020 CES\n256                                                                        CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \nsystem (or subsystem) with loads, energy sources, storage \ndevices, energy processing circuits, sensors, active controllers, \ndata buses and data processing, which features the following: \n• Balance of energy over the intended operation and \ndesign capacity \n• Re-configurability for stand -alone or grid -connected \noperations \n• Resiliency with fault tolerance and fault isolation \n• Bidirectional power flow \n• Scalability and modularity \nLocal Benefits: There are many benefits that a microgrid \nbrings to its owners locally, including \n• Enhanced energy efficiency \n• Reduced electricity cost \n• Improved power quality \n• Greater availability of power (particularly with grid) \n• Enhanced energy independence \n• Combined utility generation (gas,  heat, water, and \ncommunication  \n• Environmental conservation using renewables \n• Creation of a natural platform for local generation and \nintegration \n• Resiliency with redundancy and recovery \n• Building blocks for the next higher-level grid(s) \nGlobal Benefits: Besides local benefits, microgrids bring \nbenefits globally to the grid and surrounding communities by \n• Enhancing distributed generation with a high percentage \nof renewables \n• Enhancing distributed storage \n• Accommodating emerging demand from electric \nvehicles \n• Allowing smart metering to do transactive (dynamic) \npricing \n• Enabling local energy management without burdening \nthe grid bandwidth for communication \n• Preprocessing data locally to reduce the required g rid \nbandwidth for command and telemetry (SCADA) \n• Providing predictive local control to enhance grid \nstability \n• Using bidirectional flow to enhance energy availability \nto grid \n• Providing a balance between the distribution grid and \nmicrogrids \n• Using their ability to island and for black start \nDC microgrids are particularly advantageous for practice \ndue to their many benefits, including higher efficiency, more \nrobust system operation, no impedance matching issues, no \nsynchronization, simple waveforms, and a large body of \nknowledge in power electronics and systems being directly \nleveraged [4]-[6]. \nIII. S\nTORAGE AND ACTIVE CONTROL \nThe three salient features that separate a structured \nmicrogrid (SµG) from a  traditional microgrid are: 1) storage \ndevices, 2) active controllers, and 3) autonomous operation [4]. \n \nFig. 1: Key economies around the world are projected to be running at least \n55% renewable energy by 2050 \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2: The Hornsdale battery farm in Southern Australia (top): Accuracy and \nresponse time are much superior to those provided by large–steam-turbine-\nbased spinning reserve (bottom), proving that batteries (in a SµG) provide \nultimate inertia [12]. \nA. Storage and Energy Balance \nAmong many forms of storage, batteries are the most \nefficient and versatile. They can be fast charged and \ndischarged. Batteries are essential for SµGs since they provide \nthe ability to stow energy when it is abundantly available with \n\nTAN et al: STRUCTURED MICROGRIDS (SµGS) AND FLEXIBLE ELECTRONIC LARGE POWER TRANSFORMERS (FeLPTs)                                  257 \nFig. 3: Typical structure of an active controller for SµGs with five \n(5) levels of control and coordination [19], [20]  \n \n \nFig. 4: The first cost of a traditional (electromechanical) utility transformer \nonly occupies 1% of its life-cycle cost. The first cost of an electronic utility \ntransformer can occupy up to 10% of the total life-cycle cost, with the total \nlife-cycle cost 33% with improved performance, a cost reduction of 67% \nfor the total ownership [18]  \nsurplus and to release energy when it is least available with \ndeficit. This feature enables an energy system to achieve its \nenergy balance in a useful time frame, even with a time shifts \n[9]. It can also store and dispatch en ergy with electronic \nmeans in a timely fashion [12]. Battery is  the last missing \npiece for SµGs to impact field deployments to provide full \nbenefits for grid operations. Grid- scale deployments of \nbatteries are quickly emergin g such as those with Southern \nCalifornia Edison’s 20MW Li - ion battery deployment with \n80MWh to power 20,000 customers for 3 hours (January, \n2017), San Diego Gas & Electricity’s 30MW Li -ion battery \ndeployment with 120MWh capable of powering 20,000 \ncustomers for 4 hours (February 24, 2017), and the world’s \nlarge installation in Hornsdale, South Australian with 100MW \nand 129MWh capacity (November 28, 2017). \nA recent report by the Australian Energy Market Operators \nfor the Hornsdale facility presented for the first time field \nmeasured response for their installed grid-scale batteries “farm” \nproviding frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) in \nSouthern Australia [12]. Refer to Fig. \n2. The bottom left plot \nof the figure shows the response to the FCAS command in the \ntime domain. It is seen that the system responded sluggishly. \nSometimes, it could not even respond (flat portions). The \nbottom right plots  of the figure shows the FCAS responses \nwhen the installed batteries are used as the spinning reserve. \nIt is seen that the response followed the commands almost \ninstantaneously. The command (Black) and response (Red) \ncurves are almo st indistinguishable. The FCAS services that \nthe battery farm provided are “rapid, accurate and valuable.” \nCompared to a typical synchronous generator’s mechanical \ninertia, batteries provide “ultimate inertia” for super -fast \nresponse for the grid operators. \nB. Active Control \nActive control is yet another important feature of the SµGs. \n(Note: The original power station by Edison on the Pearl \nStreet in Lower Manhattan, New York, was not a SµG , since \nit did not have storage nor active control.) A typical structure \nfor an active controller is presented in Fig. 3.  The controller \nextends the traditional 3 -level hierarchical control for a \nsynchronous generator set by inserting a lower -level control \nlayer for the renewable sources [13], [14]. \nAdditional digital controller loop can be used to provide \nmore flexibility and functionality for autonomous digital \ncontrol, input/output command and telemetry, data processing, \nmode control, and state -of-health monitoring and protection \n[15], [16]. Therefore an active controller can have up to five \n(5) layers of control. Since the different hierarchical layers \nwork in multiple different time scales, care must be taken to \ncoordination of loop bandwidth,  especially for large -signal \ndynamics. To that effect, an energy -balance-based control is \nessentially important, as illustrated in [17]. \nC. Autonomous Operation \nAutonomous operation for any S µG is crucially important, \nsince it enables a structured microgrid to stand alone with full \nfunctionality for steady state, during transients, or for fault \nsurvival and recovery [15], [16]. \nAutonomy also simplifies its interface with adjacent sub - \ngrids or microgrids. It reduces the required communication \nbandwidth with a central control office such as an independent \nsystem operator (ISO) or a regional distribution system \noperator (DSO) through SCADA [20]. \n \nIV. LIFE-CYCLE COST \nSµGs development and deployment go beyond engineering. \nIt requires good understanding of technical, financial, and \nregulatory issues. For instance, the issue of life -cycle cost is \nimportant to consider at the planning phase for a S µG \ndeployment. It is important to point out that the usually high \nfirst cost for SµGs can be offset by its higher performance in \nenergy efficiency that brings cost savings over its life cycle. \nFig. 4 presents an example for the case with a utility power \ntransformer. The left graph shows that the first cost of a \ntraditional (electromechanical) utility transformer ($3,177 \nmarket price) only occupies 1% of its  life-cycle cost of  \nEarly versions appeared in the opening keynotes at APSCOM 2018 and eGrid 2019, respectively  \n258                                                                        CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \n$287,000, assuming a competitive rate of $0.12/kWh. As sume \nits electronic counterpart costs 10 times more    for  $31,765. \nWith efficiency improvement of 7.5%, the total life cost for \nsame operational life of 25 years is reduced   to $73,913. This \nis a reduction of 67% in total life -cycle cost for total \nownership; despite of the fact the first cost is 10 times more \nexpensive [18]. \nThe challenge for deployment of grid -scale electronic \npower transformers lies in that the asset owner (user and \nconsumer) is typically not in the loop f or the initial planning \nand hence the benefits are not factored in when the trade \ndecision is made. The trade for the SµG  is a bit more \ncomplicated, but the conclusion is similar, since a grid-scale \nelectronic power transformer is a key equipment for any \nstructured microgrid [7], [8]. \n \nV. STRUCTURED MICROGRID APPLICATIONS \nApplications of structured microgrids are numerous – from \nsimple combined heat and power (CHP) to complicated basic \nautonomous functional building block for a larger grid or sub -\ngrid. A first summary of typical applications for SµGs were \npresented in [20]. We will discuss some of the key \napplications here in more detail. \nSµGs can be classified into d ifferent categories by grid \npower level or size, such as mini -grids, microgrids, nano - \ngrids, etc. (Size is actually not important.), by ownership, such \nas building microgrids, community microgrids, campus \nmicrogrids, etc., or by functionality such as DC o r AC \nmicrogrids, and by applications. In the following discussion, \nwe will use application classification to allow more concise \ndiscussion on salient features [20]. \nA. Combined Heat and Power \nCHP is an early adaptor for microgri d technology. CHP \nprovides reliable base load  power, weather proof gas supply, \nand heat capture for hot water, chilled water and steam for \nheating. A campus-wide SµG was deployed by UCSD [21].  It \nfeatures self -generation of 85% electricity, 95% heat and \ncooling, 30MW  CHP plant with heat recovery, storage, solar \npower with weather forecast, backup generators, etc. \nIt is reported that the UCSD campus microgrid saves the \nuniversity greater than $10M in electricity cost, together  with \na 40% CO 2 reduction annually [21]. If the initial first coat for \nthe deployment is $100M, then the cost will be recovered in \nonly 10 years. For a typical life time of 25 years for power \nequipment, there will be 15 years  left for the asset to generate \nnet cost savings for the owner. \nB. Data Centers \nWith the increase of the amount of data that is becoming \navailable for consumers and service providers, the required \npower has increased exponentially. It is projected to reach 4%  \nof the total CO\n2 emission [22]. Equally important is its related \nthermal removal requirement.  A typical ratio for  power and \nheat removal is 55%/45%. A useful metric is the reductions in \nCO2 emission and electricity consumption can be achieved \nthrough improved value of the power usage effectiveness \n(PUE). \nImprovement of PUE can be accomplished through various \nenergy efficiency measures such as locations in cold places, \nfor instance. But recent trend is to localize energy demand and \nmanagement to local areas through energy efficiency, \ncomputational power optimization, and integration of locally \navailable renewables such as solar and wind. To this end, \nconfiguration of power infrastructure for data centers into \nstructured microgrids has the largest potential [23]. \nC. Demand Response \nDemand response (DR) has recently attracted a large \namount of attention from utilities. The left plot of Fig. 5 \nshows a typical case for demand response in time domain.  It \nis clearly seen that demand response is more effecti ve than \npower curtailments. The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission projects that DR will significantly increase. The \nright plot of Fig. 5 shows another aspect of DR– active pricing. \nBecause of its nature of being an actively  controlled, a S µG \ncan provide the infrastructure for active demand response [24] \nwith clear economic benefits. \n \n \n \n \nFig. 5.  SµGs provide flexible, ultimate demand response \nD. Ancillary Support \nSµGs are versatile in providing grid support capabilities as \nsummarized in Fig. 6.  SµGs can provide just about any \nfunctionalities that grid operators would like to have, \nincluding, but not limited to, efficiency enhancement, \nresiliency, reliability and availability; natural integration of \nrenewables; local storage for energy balance; ultimate demand \n\nTAN et al: STRUCTURED MICROGRIDS (SµGS) AND FLEXIBLE ELECTRONIC LARGE POWER TRANSFORMERS (FeLPTs)                                  259 \nresponse, including peak shaving; ultimate spinning reserve ; \nultimate linearizer for reactive load and renewables; \nautomation for  substations; autonomous protection and fault \nmanagement; autonomous flow control/communication for \ntransactive energy;  and ancillary support (frequency \nregulation, Volt/Var control, power factor correction and \nHarmonics) [20]. \nIt covers the entire range of supply chain for electricity \nsupply – from bulk generation to transmission to distribution \n(T&D) to grid edge to consumers [20]. Among the many \nfunctions, ancillary support is a critical service for grid \noperation [25]. Fig. 7  shows the measured results for \nfrequency regulation obtained from a university -campus \nstructured microgrid [26]. \nE. Substation Automation and Electronictization  \nAnother large area for SµGs applications is to configure a \nsubstation as a S µG, where renewable energy, storage and \nactive control can be seamlessly integrated to enhance the \nreliability, resiliency and stability locally [27]-[30]. \nWith the injection of local energy into the substation, the \nvoltage profile for the T&D can be enhanced [28]. The ability  \nFig. 6.  SµGs provide versatile grid support capabilities [20] \n \nFig. 7.  Structured microgrids can naturally provide ancillary support for grid \nstabilization. \n \nFig. 8.  Cost of billion-dollar weather event are staggering [32]. \n \nFig. 9: Super-fast charging infrastructure [31] \n \nFig. 10. A fractal structure for meshed power network with SµGs as the \nbuilding blocks [9] \nFig. 11. Flexible electronic power transformer is a key element for SµGs and \ngrid modernization [7], [8]. \nfor Volt/Var control can enhance the stability of the local grid. \nFurthermore, with independent energy from local renewable \nintegration and with equipment from the family of All-Things- \nGrid-Connected [4], many power flow control techniques, \nsuch as unified power flow controller (UPFC), can be applied \nto a substation, w hich in turn will strengthen the grid locally \n[29], [30]. \nF. Ultra-Fast Battery Charging Station \nChallenges for ultra -fast battery charging power stations \ninclude: accommodation of up to four (4) levels of charging \nEarly versions appeared in the opening keynotes at APSCOM 2018 and eGrid 2019, respectively  \n260                                                                        CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \nrequirements, efficient battery operation and maintenance, \nadiabatic and flexible power conversion, high power level at \nburst rate, integration of renewables, low lifecycle ownership \ncost, grid support, reliability, and long operational life [31]. \nUltra-fast charging demands power level up to 300kW each. \nFor a multi -station charging facility, this can easily go  into \nmegawatts range. Direct connection to the grid by this amount \nof power will impact power quality and even grid integrity, \nparticularly where the grid is weak. A superior approach is to \nconfigure a charging station as a S µG to integrate renewables \nwith storage and to provide grid support services to make \nbusiness case feasible [31]. Fig. 9 is an illustration of such a \nSµG configured as an ultra-fast charging station. \nG. Stand-Alone and Remote Energy Access \nStand-alone and remote microgrids include spacecraft, \naircraft, or ship application s, or public transportation, or \napplications in  a remote geographical area where large-scale \ndeployment of power delivery infrastructure is economically \ninfeasible. \nThe energy access can be ensured through a remote, stand - \nalone S µG (No requirement for grid connection). The S µG \ncan provide the require energy by integrating local renew able \nenergy with solar, wind, or geothermal [7], [8]. \nH. Critical Infrastructure and Resiliency \nCritical infrastructures include hospitals, airports, \ntransportation command centers, grid operationa l control \ncenters, emergency response centers, law -enforcement \ninstitutions, etc. The electricity availability for a prescribed \nextended time of operation after the emergency is an absolute \nrequirement. The common practice is to use a back- up \ngenerator set with adequate capacity to fulfill the requirement \n[32]. \nRecent increased awareness of cyber security issue that can \npotentially cripple a power grid had led to the requirement for \na power grid to have built -in protection aga inst natural or \nman-made disasters. While cyber security is usually treated as \na software/firmware issue, a S µG can provide the ultimate \nprotection, where hardware based protections can be \nimplemented to bypass the digital control driven by \nsoftware/firmware and maintain or restore the essential \nfunctions for the system [15].  \nI. Basic Building Blocks for Electronic Grids \nSµGs can serve as the basic building blocks for the future \nelectronic grid (eGrid). It can either support a traditional \nmeshed power network or as a redial power network [9]. \nFigure 10 shows a fractal meshed structure. A modular, multi -\nlevel, and multi -time scale converter (3M) can be the basic \nelements for interconnects and power flow control as required \n[29]. \nJ. Physical Transactive Energy \nWith the alignment of regulatory policies more towards \ntransactive energy, the full potential of structured microgrids \ncan be further realized to allow physically determining how \nenergy transactions are directly performed from consumers to \nconsumers, without having to go through aggregation process \nfirst and then distribution, all through an ISO or DSO. This \nunprecedented capability is bring about by the powerfulness \nof SµGs because of its energy balance and active control \ncapabilities [19], [20]  and with its ability to control phase \nangle independently. \nA structured microgrid integrates and linearizes renewable \nenergies naturally to the power grid. The traditional grid \noperator such as ISO can play the same role in bulk generation \nand transmission.  \nFor instance, with peak shaving (demand response with \nstorage), the existing transmission lines can carry twice (2x) \nas much power. With power factor correction (linearization), \nthe existing transmission lines can carry 1/0.68=1.47 times \nmore power. So with the existing lines, grid modernization \nwill triple the transmission and distribution capacity, a win -\nwin-win for consumers, grid operators, and the environment.  \nWith SµGs capability for renewable integration and ac tive \ncontrol, the utility company can triple their transmission and \ndistribution capacity without having to increase transmission \nline capacity [20]. \nVI. FLEXIBLE ELECTRONIC LARGE POWER TRANSFORMERS \nStructured microgrids (SµGs) and flexible electronic large \npower transformers (FeLPTs) are emerging as two essential \ntechnologies for renewable energy integration and active \ncontrol for flexible power transmission. The early concept of \nFeLPTs was introduced by the author [7]- [9]. The conceptual \nillustration is captured in Figure 11. A FeLPT features 3M as \nits characteristics: Modular in its composition, M ulti-level \nwithin its power processing, and  M ulti-time-scale in its \ncontrol [6]-[9]. \nA FeLPT s flexibility in processing, control, and re -\nconfigurability offers the capability for flexible ac \ntransmission with effective power flow control . It can also \nintegrate SµGs’ connectivity while still keeping multi- scale \nsystem level control [29], [30]. SµGs provides the i ntegration \nof renewable energy, active control, and storage capacity to \nbalance the energy demand and supply automatically.  \nChallenges in SµGs  integra\n tion include accurate forecast \nfor renewable availability, cost- effective design, and efficient \ncontrol ( Grid forming or following). Challenges in FeLPTs \ninclude efficiency, reliability, size and cost parity  as discussed \nbelow.  \nA. Challenges for FeLPTs designs \nChallenges for FeLPTs designs are in three general areas. \nThe first one is to achieve ultra -high power efficiency with \nmultiple power processing stages as required for power station \napplications to reduce operational cost (electricity bill). The \nsecond challenge is to obtain high reliability over the entire \ndesign life, say, for more than 25 years. The third challenge is \nto achieve control flexibility to support grid operations while \nensure local power supply with voltage and frequency control. \nTake a typical distribution power substation as one example. \nFigure 12 is a typical FeLPT architecture for power substation  \napplications [33]. There  are three major sub -conversions: A \nTAN et al: STRUCTURED MICROGRIDS (SµGS) AND FLEXIBLE ELECTRONIC LARGE POWER TRANSFORMERS (FeLPTs)                                  261 \nfront-end conversion circuit to interface with the grid, an \nintermediate conversion  circuit for isolation , and voltage \nscaling (A dual active bridge  for this case), and low -voltage \nconversion to interface with users. \nAs reported by the authors, the various losses are presented \nin Figure 13. The first sub -conversion is typically the \nrectification to obtain a dc voltage (or vice versa) . This stage \nis typically highly efficient as shown in the Figure 14 to be \n99.46%. The second sub- conversion is to provide isolation \nand volt age scaling at relatively high  switching frequency. \nThe efficiency i s projected to at 98.33% for a well -designed \ncircuit. The galvanic isolation transformer usually take close \nto a 1% of power loss, which is the obstacle for the \nintermediate conversion to be adiabatic (>98.5% efficient). \nThe third sub -conversion is on the relatively low voltage side \nfor the user interface. The achievable efficiency is at 96.5% \nonly, the lowest among the three. The underlining reason is \nthe need to process high power with large amount of current \nand relatively low voltage levels.  \nFigure 14 presents details on opportunities and challenges \nto improving the design. Figure 14 (1) is the baseline design \nloss breakdown. Fig. 14 (2) shows that the switching loss, for \ninstance, can be reduced by 50% by changing the circuit \ntopology from Neutral Poin t Clamped (NPC) to Neutral Point \nParalleled (NPP).   \nFig. 14 (3) shows the challenges we are facing in achieving \nthe improvements required to obtain adiabatic power \nconversion for the intermediate sub -conversion. To achieve \n99.49%, we need change NPC to NPP for 1/2 reduction of \nswitching loss, use better FETs for 1/2 to ¾ reduction of \nconduction loss, and better techniques for ½ reduction of total \ntransformer loss. That is, we need 0.5% loss transformer s. \nThis represents a significant challenge. Recent advancement \nin techniques towards 99% efficiency and 99% duty ratio [34] \ncan potentially help make progress towards that goal.  \nFig. 14 (4) shows the numerical numbers that we need to \nachieve 99.49% for the low-voltage conversion portion with \nreduction of ½ for both the switching and conduction loss. \nBetter switching devices [19] and better circuit topologies can \nhelp achieve the goal [34].  \nB. Flexibility and Versatility \nA FeLPT is a flexible power device. Its terminal behavior is \nreconfigurable to be resistive, capacitive,  inductive or any \ncombination, commendable from the central control or \ndispatcher. Figure 15 is an illustrative diagram for a multi-\nconverter configuration as presented in [35]. This generalized \n \nFig. 12.  A typical FeLPT architecture [33]. \n \nFig. 13.

A FeLPT can be derived from a multiple converter system \n[35]Challenges for FeLPTs designs \nunified power flow controller (GUPFC) uses three \nindependently controlled converters to realize its general \nunified flow control. It can be shown that the GUPEC can be \nimplemented with a coupled three-winding magnetic structure  \nto form a three-phase power transformer. Hence a FeLPT can \nsimultaneously serve as a power transformer and as a flexible \ntransmission device.  This unprecedented functionality brings \nEarly versions appeared in the opening keynotes at APSCOM 2018 and eGrid 2019, respectively  \n262                                                                        CES TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND SYSTEMS, VOL. 4, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2020 \nsignificant benefits as outlined below. \nC. Benefits of FeLPTs \nWe note that renewable energy integration provides the \nrequired freedoms of control with 3 angles and 3 amplitudes \nas the control variable. Hence the FeLPTs can be a true \nFACTs device. Its combined capability for power transfer and \nflow control provides value added for electronic large power \ntransformers to offset its potentially high cost with \nunprecedented capability to system operators, grid assets \nowners (utilities) and consumers.  \nAs the technology progress, successful inte gration of solar \nand battery energy systems has proven to be technically \neffective and economically beneficial.  Australia Han dsdale \nSolar Farm has reduced the operator cost by tens of millions  \nof dollars  [12]. Recent advancement has even demonstrated \nthat solar and storage based peakers can cost less than gas \nbased ones as recently reported in [36]. Large utilities are now \nbuilding more solar and battery based peakers than gas \npeakers as spinning reserve.  \nA FeLPT can also behave as phase angle regulator to enable \nperson-to-person ( P2P) trans-active energy  by active control  \nas first shown in [7].   \nVII. CONCLUSION \nStructured Microgrids ( SµGs) are natural vehicles for \nrenewable energy integration into the power grid. Because of \ntheir benefits and their versatility , they are the ultimate assets \nfor utilities and independent system operators. \nEarly adaptors of SµGs for combined heat and power (CHP) \nhave shown large cost savings with reducing CO2 footprints. \nSµGs enable the utility industry to be better prepared for the \nemerging large increase in base load demand from electric \nvehicles and data centers. This is a win -win-win situation for \nthe consumer, the utilities (Independent system operators), \nand the environment. \nSµGs are also powerful in turning back- up generator sets \nfrom idle to active assets for revenue generation. They are \nvaluable in power substation automation and in energy surety, \nreliability, resiliency, and security. \nThe first cost associated with a SµG deployment can be \noffset with reduced operating cost, which in turn reduces the \ntotal life-cycle cost by 33% to 67%, pending on market rates \nfor electricity. \nIt is shown that through SµGs’ storage, active control and \nautonomy capabilities, a 300 -percent increase in bulk \ntransmission and distribution lines are possible without having \nto increase capacity.  \nSµGs will also be extremely useful as a basic building \nblock for future electronic grids and as an enabler for physical \ntransactive energy when integrated with a FeLPT. \nFlexible electronic large power transformers (FeLPTs) are \nultra-efficient and ultra flexible electronics devices that \nintegrate SµGs to form renewable -energy-based power \nsubstations. Key features are modular, multilevel and multi -\ntimescale. \nA FeLPT can provide the capabilities that typically required \nby two traditional devices (power transformer and FACT \ndevice) within one subsystem . This unprecedented capability \nwill bring them into coast parity. It will also bring \nrevolutionary capability to enable the power grid ’s active \ncontrol with benefits for system operators, grid assets owners \n(utilities) and consumers. \nChallenges for FeLPTs design and deployment lie in \nobtaining ultra-efficient power conversion with  near adiabatic \nthermal capability and achieving 0.5% -loss electronic power \ntransformer design. Recent advancement in 99% efficiency \nand 99% duty ratio [34] can potentially provide the needed \nbreakthrough in achieving the goals.  \nREFERENCES \n[1] International Energy Agency, “Renewabl e energy coming of age,”  \nJournal of International Energy Agency, Issue  2, Spring, 2012 \n[2] R.
