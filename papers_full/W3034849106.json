Because of, the  large \nnumber of transformer distributed over a wide area in power \nelectric system, the data acquisition and condition monitoring is \na impo rtant issue. To monitor this operator has to vis it to \ntransformer location itself.  The main aim of this system is  to \nmonitoring the  distribution transformer  parameter like load \ncurrent, voltage,  oil level and oil tempe rature using IOT. So \nusing this it can  minimize working efforts and improve \naccuracy, stability and efficiency. Sensors are used to sense the \nmain parameters of equipment such as voltage, current, \ntemperature and oil level, this sensed data is sent to ESP 32 \nmicrocontroller. ESP 32 is a series  of low cost, low power on a \nchip microcontroller with integrated Wi -Fi and dual mode \nBluetooth. So, there is no need to connect Wi -Fi module \nexternally, hence size of project is also small. This controller \nchecks parameter limits which further send to the  IOT web \nserver Blynk software using Wi -Fi module of these data makes \nsure the right information is in hand to the operator and \noperator can make useful decisions before any catastrophic \nfailure on basis of that data of parameters.    \n \nKeywords- IOT (Internet of Things); ESP 32; temperature sensor; \nvoltage sensor; current sensor; ultrasonic sensor, distribution \ntransformer. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n             Internet of things (IOT) is the inter -networking of \nphysical devises vehicles (also referred to as “con nected \ndevise” and “smart devices”). Buildings and other items \nembedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and \nnetwork connectivity that enable these objects to collect and \nexchange data. \n              IOT allows objects to be sensed or contro lled \nremotely across existing network infrastructure, creating \nopportunities for more direct integration of the physical world \ninto computer base system, and resulting in improved \nefficiency, accuracy and economic benefit in addition to \nreduced human intervention. \n              Distribution transformers have  long service like if \nthey operated under good and rated conditions. However, \ntheir life is significantly reduced if they are overloaded, \nresulting an unexpected failures and loss of supply to a large \nnumber of customers thus effecting system reliability. \nOverloading and ineffective cooling of transformer are the \nmeasure causes of failure in distribution transformer. Most \npower companies uses Supervisory Control and Data \nAcquisition (SCADA) system for onl ine monitoring of power \ntransformer but extending the SCADA system for online \nmonitoring of distribution transformer is an expensive \nproposition. Distribution transformers are  currently \nmonitored manually where a person periodically visits to a \ntransformer site for maintenance and records parameter of \nimportance. This type of monitoring cannot provide \ninformation about occasional overloads and overheating of \ntransformer oil and windings. All these factors can \nsignificantly reduce transformer life.                                                          \n             Our system is designed is based upon online \nmonitoring of key operational parameters  can provide useful \ninformation about the health of transformer which will help \nthe utilities to optimally use their transformer and keep the \nasset in operation  for longer period. This system will help us \nto identify problems before any catastrophic failure, thus \nresulting in a long life service for transformer. \n            This system is based upon t he embedded system as \nself- contained program that are embedded within a piece of \nhardware. Embedded system are usually set to a specific task, \nanother of thinking of an embedded system is as a computer \nsystem that is created with optimal efficiency, there by \nallowing it to complete specific functions as quickly as \npossible. It is also has the advantage s of significant cost \nsaving, power consumption and greater reliability. \n \nII. BLOCK DIAGRAM \n               Below figure shows the schematic block diagram of \nsetup. Sensors are connected to the distribution transformer \nand ESP32. Voltage, current, oil level and oil temperature are \ncontinuously sensed by respective sensors and sensed data are \nsend to the ESP 32 where it calculate sensed data as per the \nprogramming done in it , then it sends data  to the blynk app \nvia Wi-Fi. Blynk app has to be installed in our mobile, where \nwe can continuously monitor all the parameters. If any \nparameter exceeds beyond its threshold val ue due to any \nabnormality in transformer  then operator will received SMS \nthrough GSM. \nInternational Journal of Engineering Research & Technology (IJERT)\nISSN: 2278-0181http://www.ijert.org\nIJERTV9IS060244\n(This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.)\nPublished by :\nwww.ijert.org\nVol. 9 Issue 06, June-2020\n335\n \nFig.1- Block Diagram \n \nIII.

The ESP32 series employs a Tensilica  Xtensa \nLX6 microprocessor in both dual core and single core \nvariations includes built in antenna swit ches, RF balun, \npower amplifier, low noise receive  amplifier, filters, and  \npower management modules. Voltage, current,  temperature \nand oil level are sense in analog form and converted into \ndigital using respective sensors and then sensed data is fed \nto the ESP 32. Below diagram shows pin diagram of Wi -Fi \nLora ESP 32. \n \n \nFig.8- Pin Diagram of Wi-Fi Lora ESP 32 \n \nF. GSM MODULE:- \nFig- GSM Module \nGSM module is used to establish connection between a \ncomputer GSM-GPRS system. Global System for Mobile \nCommunications (GSM) is an architecture used for mobile \ncommunication in most of the countries. GSM module is \nconsists of a GSM modem assembled together with power \nsupply circuit and communication interfaces for computer. \n \nIV. SOFTWARE ASPECTS \n \nUsing the microcontroller native language, a softw are \nalgorithm is developed in Arduino IDE software which is an \nopen source app where one can code, compile and upload a \nfile in any arduion device. The algorithm is start by \ninitializing the input output ports data direction flow. Then it \nbegins to command the sequence according to the algorithm. \nIt continuously chec ks voltage, current, temperature and oil \nlevel reading and sends to blynk app via   Wi-Fi. Blynk app \nis open source app where operator monitored data at any \ntime and any place. If any parameter value exceeds beyond \nits threshold value then through GSM oper ator get message \nimmediately on mobile, so he can take suitable action. \n \nV. RESULT \nThis introduces a new and improves method of transformer \nparameter monitoring using IOT. Sensors incorporated in \nthe system collect the data of transformer. Main parameters \nof equipment such as voltage, current, temperature and oil  \nlevel. This sensed data is send  to ESP32 and this controller \nchecks parameter limits which further sent to the IOT web \nserver Blynk software using Wi -Fi module. Thus the real \ntime data monitoring are possible with the system. \n \nVI. CONCLUSION                                               \nThe IOT  based monitoring of distribution transformer is \nquite useful as compared to manual monitoring and also it is \nreliable as it is not possible to monitor always the v oltage, \ncurrent, oil level a nd temperature rise manually. If  any \nabnormality occurs operator gets a message so we can take \naction to prevent any failures of distribution transformers, \nthus we can recover the system in less time and faults before \nany uncertain failures. Thus this system is cost saving and as \ncontroller that we used has small size compared to other \ncontroller, the overall size of whole setup is also small. \n \nVII.
