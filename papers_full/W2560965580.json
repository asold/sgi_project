  "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, the properties of AE signals originating from phenomena occurring during magnetization of ferromagnetic materials which are used to construct power transformer cores are presented. The AE signals in a selected power oil transformer were recorded and analyzed. The analysis included, i.e., time, frequency, and time-frequency analyses, calculations of amplitude distributions of the signals and defined AE descriptors, determination of the descriptor map on the side walls of transformers, as well as a detailed analysis of selected part of the signals. The maps of descriptors were analyzed in the frequency bands of 20–70 kHz, 70–100 kHz, and 100–200 kHz. The analysis of the properties of the signals was performed in time and frequency domains. Based on the analysis, there were identified the AE signals originating from the phenomena occurring during the core magnetization of a power oil transformer. To identify those phenomena, the maps of the ADC descriptor calculated in the band of 20–70 kHz when selecting the measurement points in which there were no AE sources from partial discharges were used. An analysis of magnetoacoustic emission signals in the bands of 70–100 kHz and 100–200 kHz was also performed.

Magnetic phenomena in ferromagnetic\nmaterials\nPhenomena in ferromagnetic materials are one of\nthe sources of acoustic signals in power oil trans-\nformers. During the magnetization of ferromagnetic\nmaterials which are used to construct transformer\ncore laminations, there occurs the reversible movement\nof domain boundaries (the so-called Bloch walls), irre-\nversible movement of domain boundaries (Barkhausen\neﬀect), and rotation of magnetization vectors in the\ndirection of the external magnetic ﬁeld. Within these\nprocesses, there occur processes of creation of domain\nboundaries, movement of these boundaries, and their\nannihilation.\nThe Barkhausen jump results in (i) the generation\nof an electromagnetic wave (Barkhausen ﬁeld eﬀect –\nHEB), (ii) a local change of the magnetization and\ndefects in the crystal lattice and (iii) the generation of\nan acoustic wave (magnetoacoustic emission eﬀect).\nThe phenomenon of magnetoacoustic emission\n(MAE) consists in generating a sound wave by a jump\nmotion of a 90\u000e domain wall in a material with non-\nzero magnetostriction ( Augustyniak, 1999). A MAE\nsignal depends not only on the microstructure, stresses\nor the magnetization frequency, but also on the geom-\netry of the sample and its demagnetization.\nMAE has a relatively short history. It was ﬁrst re-\nported by A.E. Lord in the middle 1970-s ( Lord,1975).\nHe called that eﬀect “the acoustic Barkhausen ef-\nfect” by analogy with „the classic Barkhausen eﬀect”.\nElastic waves generated during MAE are caused by\nchanges in magnetostrictive stresses during the magne-\ntization process. The rate of changes of magnetostric-\ntive stresses is one of more important factors aﬀect-\ning magnetoacoustic emission. It depends on: (i) mag-\nnetostrictive properties of the material, (ii) the value\nof magnetic ﬂux density B inside the material and\n(iii) the rate of magnetic ﬂux density change d B=dt\n(Edwards, Palmer, 1987).\nM. Guyot and V. Cagan (1993) indicate the\npresence of two MAE emission maxima. The ﬁrst\none occurs immediately after changing the direction\nof magnetization and is associated with the creation of\ndomain boundaries. The second one is connected with\nthe movement and annihilation of all domain bound-\n800 Archives of Acoustics – Volume 41, Number 4, 2016\naries. The MAE minimum is in the vicinity of coercive\npoint HC.\nDeheng et al. (1988) show that the main frequency\nband for the magnetoacoustic emission phenomenon in\ninvestigations of transformers is 20–65 kHz, whereas\nthe total band for the phenomena associated with\nthe magnetization of transformer core sheets (HEB +\nMAE) is 10–65 kHz. Howells et al. (Howells, Nor-\nton, 1978) determine the frequency range of magnetic\nnoise as 30–60 kHz. In ( Bengtsson et al. , 1997), ex-\ntend the band of signals associated with noises in the\ncore up to 80 kHz. From ( Piotrowski et al. , 2012)\nit follows that the MAE signal spectrum for steel can\nreach up to 300 kHz.\n2. Research method\nTo record AE signals in the investigated power\noil transformer, the author’s measuring system EA\nDEMA-COMP (Witos, 2008) has been used. It can be\nused both for research conducted in a laboratory and\nmeasurements taken during normal operation of power\ntransformers. Figure 1 shows a general view of the mea-\nsuring system.\nFig. 1.

Witos – Identiﬁcation of AE Signals Originating from the Core Magnetization . . . 801\nAE signals recorded by the measuring system are\nanalyzed by the author’s system for AE signal analysis\n(Witos, 2008). The analysis includes the calculation of\nbasic characteristics and amplitude distributions of sig-\nnals, deﬁned AE descriptors with ADP, ADC, ADNC\nacronyms ( Witos et al. , 2002; Olszewska, Witos ,\n2012; Witos, Olszewska , 2012; Witos, Gacek ,\n2013), determination of maps of descriptors on side\nwalls of transformers, and next location of sources of\nAE signals as well as the analysis of properties of the\nsignals recorded at the points located in the neigh-\nbourhood of the identiﬁed sources. Figure 2 presents\nexample characteristics belonging to the basic descrip-\ntion of the AE signal recorded in the power oil trans-\nformer.\nTime waveforms of AE signal (Fig. 2a) are sub-\njected to multiple analysis in discrimination threshold\n(U). The result of these analyzes are amplitude dis-\ntributions of: AE count rate, signal power, and AE\nnormalised activity of counts.\nProperties of amplitude distributions of AE (made\nin logarithmic scale) can be described by means of\nspecially deﬁned AE descriptors. The descriptors were\ndeﬁned as follows. At ﬁrst, one should mark a frag-\nment of an amplitude distribution curve which cor-\nresponds to the range of the discrimination thresh-\nold ( Ud, Ug); value of Ud is determined by the min-\nimum of amplitude distribution derivative against the\ndiscrimination threshold, whereas Ug is 90% of the\nmaximal value of the recorded signal.

ADC descriptor is connected\nwith Amplitude Distribution of AE Counts, ADP de-\nscriptor is connected with Amplitude Distribution of\nAE signal Power and ADNC descriptor is connected\nwith Amplitude Distribution of AE Normalized activ-\nity Counts.\nThe so deﬁned descriptors do not base on the abso-\nlute values of the recorded signal. A larger descriptor\nvalue (ﬂatter part of the curve) means a more advanced\ndeformational process.\nFigure 3 shows the example amplitude distribu-\ntions of the count rate calculated in the framework of\nthe advanced analysis (Figs. 3a, c), derivatives of these\ndistributions with respect to the threshold of discrimi-\nnation (Fig. 3b), and corresponding values of the ADC\ndescriptor (Fig. 3d) for two families of AE signals –\nthose coming from sources of partial discharges (PDs)\n(Fig. 3c, signals 1–5) and the noises associated with the\nmeasuring channel (Fig. 3c, signals 6–10). One can see\na fundamental diﬀerence between the descriptor values\nin those two families, which conﬁrms the assumption of\nthe possibility of recording and identifying AE signals\ncoming from diﬀerent sources.\nThe maps of descriptors on the side walls of the\ninvestigated transformer tank are determined from\nthe obtained descriptors with the use of the kriging\nmethod. On the maps, there are local maxima. Fig-\nure 4 shows an exemplary map of an ADC descriptor\n802 Archives of Acoustics – Volume 41, Number 4, 2016\nFig. 4.

Identiﬁcation and properties of AE signals\ncoming from phenomena occurring\nduring magnetization of a power oil\ntransformer core\nIdentiﬁcation of AE signals coming from the phe-\nnomena occurring during the magnetization of ferro-\nmagnetic materials will be presented based on the ana-\nlysis of the AE signals recorded in the investigated\npower transformer with a ratio of 110/20/6 kV and\nrated power of 25 MVA. The transformer has been ope-\nrating faultlessly for the whole operating life.\nDue to the fact that the lower limit of frequency\nrange of the measuring system used in the research\nequals 20 kHz, the analysis will be carried out in the\nrange of 20–70 kHz.\nOn the map of the ADC descriptor in the band of\n20–70 kHz (Fig. 6a), the areas of the greatest inten-\nsity of the AE signals were determined provided that\nthe corresponding with them descriptor values in the\nrange of 110–200 kHz were small. These areas deter-\nmine the places in which MAE signals are dominant in\nthe recorded signals. To identify the AE signals coming\nFig. 6.

The properties of\nthe recorded signal are as follows: the signal is periodic;\nit has the dominant frequency band of 20–40 kHz; in\neach period of the supply voltage, large signal values\nare arranged in wide “corridors” (Fig. 7c); on the\naveraged phase characteristics (Fig. 7b) the averaged\nvalues calculated for these corridors can be seen and,\ndepending on the choice of the discrimination thresh-\nold value, there are two or four ranges of the reference\nvoltage phases for which the MAE signals are recorded.\n804 Archives of Acoustics – Volume 41, Number 4, 2016\na)\n b)\nc)\n d)\n e)\nFig. 7. Basic description of the AE signal recorded at the selected measurement point of the tested transformer (ﬁle\nPA032(2).BIN): a) frequency characteristic, b) averaged phase characteristic, c) phase-time characteristic, d) and e) aver-\naged STFT spectrograms; ADC = \u00001:21 (20–70 kHz).\nOn the averaged phase characteristics (Fig. 7b) and\naveraged spectrogram (Figs. 7d and e) the asymmetry\nof the values and shape of the characteristics both for\ntwo and four corridors can be seen.\nWhen selecting the value of the discrimination\nthreshold as 500 mV, one can see in Fig. 7b two\nranges of reference voltage phases equal to (40\u000e; 135\u000e),\n(225\u000e; 310\u000e), respectively, for which MAE signals are\nrecorded at the measurement point PA032.\nIncrease in the value of the discrimination thresh-\nold to approx. 600–700 mV results in distinguishing\nfour ranges of reference voltage phases for which MAE\nsignals are recorded. Two of them are within the phase\nrange of (40\u000e; 135\u000e) and two others are within the se-\ncond phase range, namely (225\u000e; 310\u000e). Such a location\nof ranges is associated with the respective parts of the\nmagnetic hysteresis loop. Distinguishing two ranges de-\ntermines the reference voltage phases for which the\nmagnetic ﬁeld takes the appropriate positive or neg-\native values. Further division into four ranges corre-\nsponds to four parts of the magnetic hysteresis loop\nfor which the magnetic ﬁeld values increase and de-\ncrease within each of the two pre-determined ranges.\nFour ranges can be observed when the magnetoacous-\ntic emission has one local maximum for each of the\nfour parts of the hysteresis loop.\nAdditionally, the analysis of selected parts of the\n20-ms signal was performed. The analyzed part of the\nAE signal was ﬁltered in diﬀerent frequency bands.\nFigure 8 shows the results of that analysis for selected\nfrequency ranges. After ﬁltration in the band of 20–\n70 kHz, one can distinguish two wide ranges (1–7 ms\nand 11–17 ms) in which the analyzed signal has larger\nvalues (Fig. 8a). Taking into account the fact that the\nAE signals recorded at that measurement point had\nthe dominant frequency band of 20–40 kHz, those sig-\nnals were next ﬁltered in the band of 40–70 kHz. Fil-\ntration of signals in that frequency range allowed dis-\ntinguishing several single structures of duration equal\nto approx. 150–300 \u0016s (Fig. 8b).\nAt this stage of the analysis, it can be noted that\nthe MAE signals recorded at the measurement point\nhave the following characteristic features:\n\u000f they occur within wide ranges of phases,\n\u000f harmonics of frequencies 20–40 kHz are dominant\nin the band of 20–70 kHz,\n\u000f single distinguished signals have durations of ap-\nprox. 150–300 \u0016s.\nTo better characterize the discussed phenomena,\nthe AE signals recorded at measurement points PA02y\n(y = 1, 2, . . . , 6 – numbering from bottom of\nthe transformer) were analyzed. These points are\nevenly distributed along one vertical line on the trans-\nformer tank.\nThe exact coordinates of the measurement points\nPA02y are given in Table 1, column 2. This table con-\ntains the average values and mean standard devia-\ntions of the selected descriptors (ADP, ADC, ADNC,\nUmax \u0000 min and U rms) for the signals recorded at the\nmeasurement points belonging to the family PA02y.\nThe results shown in Table 1 are also presented in the\ngraphical form in Fig. 9.\nFigure 9 can be seen as the classiﬁcation of the AE\nsignal registered at measurement points belonging to\nthe family PA02y made with the use of the two types\nof descriptors based on: the values measured directly\n(Umax \u0000 min and Urms), the physical phenomena (ADC,\nADP and ADNC). A great similarity of both types of\nclassiﬁcation can be noted. For both types of descrip-\ntors minima of histograms occur for the values at the\npoint of PA024, whereas in extreme points PA021 and\nPA026 descriptor values belong to the set of the largest\nvalues.\nA.

In addition, when\nanalyzing the signal in the band of 20–70 kHz it can\nbe noted that the ﬁrst maximum values in the ﬁrst of\nthe two distinguished ranges are larger than the ﬁrst\nmaximum values in the second range; such a regularity\ndoes not occur when analyzing the signal in the band\nof 40–70 kHz.\nIn a more detailed analysis which leads to sepa-\nration of individual curves within each range (ob-\ntained from distinguishing two ranges), one should\nﬁrst designate the envelope and then see this enve-\nlope as a superposition of two or three Gaussian-\ntype curves. With this approach, in each of the range\nthere can be seen one Gaussian-type curve in the ini-\ntial part of the range and one or two such curves in\nthe further part of the range.

It is worth emphasizing that the\nphases shown in the diagrams describe the phases of\nthe power supply used in the measurement system and\ndo not specify the phase current ﬂowing in the wind-\ning, which induces magnetic ﬂux in the tested core.\nQuantitative diﬀerences and qualitative diﬀerences\nin the shapes of the curves of the individual graphs in\nFig. 12 contain information about the local magnetic\nproperties of the tested materials.\nA similar analysis can be performed for STFT\nspectrograms shown in Fig. 13. The higher sensitivity\nSTFT spectrograms as compared to the averaged char-\nacteristics of the phase is visible.\nSuch an approach to the averaged phase charac-\nteristics of Figs. 12 and 13 allows concluding that the\nmagnetoacoustic emission:\n\u000f distinguishes between the processes of magnetiza-\ntion and demagnetization,\n\u000f distinguishes between the processes of magnetiza-\ntion and demagnetization at positive and negative\nvalues of the magnetic ﬁeld,\n\u000f shows the local properties of transformer core\nsheets.\nTo further characterize the AE signals coming from\nthe phenomena occurring during magnetization of fer-\nromagnetic materials, the analysis of the signals after\nﬁltration in the bands of 70–100 kHz and 100–200 kHz\nwas conducted. From calculations, i.a., ADC and ADP\ndescriptors values (Table 2 and Fig. 14) and averaged\nphase characteristics and STFT spectrograms – some\nof them are presented in Figs. 15 and 16 – were ob-\ntained.\nTable 2.

At some mea-\nsurement points, the recorded signals have components\nalso in the higher bands (Fig. 15b). Participation of\nsignal harmonics in the band of 100–200 kHz, however,\ngets smaller and smaller. The low level of the advance-\nment degree of AE signals in the band of 100–200 kHz\nis conﬁrmed by the ADC descriptor values calculated\nfor the signals recorded at particular measurement\npoints belonging to the family PA02y (Table 2). For\nthe measurement points for which the maximum values\nof the amplitudes in the lower frequency bands were\nsmaller (measurement points PA022, PA023, PA024),\nthe signal amplitude in the range of 100–200 kHz\napproaches the noise level of the measuring instru-\nments.\nFrom the conducted analyses it follows that the\nmain band for the phenomena associated with mag-\nnetization of ferromagnetic materials can be extended\nup to 90 kHz.\nThe analysis of the selected parts of the signals\nof 20 ms duration recorded at particular measurement\npoints was also performed. The analysis results for the\nsignals recorded at the measurement points PA021 and\nPA026 and the frequency band of 40–70 kHz are pre-\nsented in Fig. 17.

Conclusion\nThe analysis of the AE signals coming from the\nphenomena associated with magnetization of ferro-\nmagnetic materials enabled drawing the precise con-\nclusions concerning the following properties of magne-\ntoacoustic signals:\n\u000f the main band for the phenomena associated\nwith magnetization of ferromagnetic materials is\n20–90 kHz with the dominant harmonics of 20–\n40 kHz,\n\u000f AE signals are recorded in wide ranges of phases,\n\u000f single MAE signals (if distinguishable) have dura-\ntions of approx. 150–300 \u0016s.\nThe research results conﬁrm that the magnetoa-\ncoustic emission:\n\u000f distinguishes between the processes of magnetiza-\ntion and demagnetization,\n\u000f distinguishes between the processes of magnetiza-\ntion and demagnetization at positive and negative\nvalues of the magnetic ﬁeld,\n\u000f shows the local properties of transformer core\nsheets.\nReferences\n1.
