Research has also considered biomechanics of tool use in non-\nhuman species such as primates [11]. Tool use is also an interesting field from the perspective\nof system dynamics due to the interactions that may arise between tool, environment and user\nsystem; it is little explored how important each of these three components are in determining\nthe final behaviour of the human-tool-environment system [1].\nIn the growing literature on human tool use, there are two broad perspectives to understand\ntool-using action: one perspective focuses on top-down, schema-driven control of action\nguided by stored neural representations of a tool’s properties and action sequences [12–14],\nwhich could be considered in terms of motor programs [15], respectively motor schemata\n[16]. Such a top-down perspective suggests that there exists a pre-defined specification of the\nmovement pattern which is executed in its entirety after being triggered. If tool use was purely\nschema driven, this may suggest notable variation in the adopted movement patterns between\ndifferent tool users, as each may conceptualise and approach the task differently. Within-par-\nticipant variation ought to be small as long as contextual demands were kept constant if the\nsame pre-defined program was executed repetitively. The bottom-up perspective, on the other\nhand, suggests that actions arise from the properties of the human-tool-environment system\nwithout strong need for centralized control. In broad terms, such approaches assume that a\nuser can respond to the task by deriving the necessary motor control parameters on-the-fly\nbased on the tool properties [2,8]. From such a perspective, ‘intelligence’ emerges from the\ninteraction between components of a system [17]. Self-optimisation [18] and optimal feedback\ncontrol [19] are popular concepts to explain the adoption of a specific and repeatable move-\nment pattern: both rely on an iterative convergence on an ‘optimal’ state without an a priori\nmovement schema. This optimal state could be minimal energy expenditure, with input to the\nfeedback system continuously being updated through the bodily sensory system through phys-\niological processes. The interactions between system components in the human-tool-environ-\nment system have also been considered in terms of the task’s affordance through ‘affordance\nmatching’ [2,20]: affordances describe the ways in which items lend themselves to being used.\nGiven that there is evidence for both top-down and bottom-up control in the experimental lit-\nerature, these two concepts remain competitive explanations for the observed behaviour in the\ndomain of tool use, with an emerging trend towards more evidence for bottom-up control.\nWhile the psychological and neuro-control literature are building up to a substantial body of\nwork, to date biomechanical research into the fundamentals of spontaneously arising tool use\nbehaviour in context of musculoskeletal dynamics is sparse. In this paper, we investigate–from\na biomechanical perspective–whether tool use movement can be considered to emerge as a\npredictable, bottom-up consequence of the human-tool-environment system. Our assumption\nis motivated by findings for other cyclical activities with specific ‘signature’ frequencies such as\nwalking or running. We hypothesized that spontaneous repetitive actions in tool use would\nresult in a narrow range of movement cycle frequencies similar to these cyclical locomotor\nactivities.\nResearch into repetitive actions has long scientific history. Work in the early 20\nth\ncentury\nalready reflected on the rhythmically consistent nature of the operation of tools [21,22]. Repet-\nitive actions and movements are common when using for example hammers, saws, screwdriv-\ners, planes, axes or adzes. However, there was limited attempt to provide an explanation for\nthese observations. Research in biomechanics has shown that repetitive actions are generally\nperformed at rates which minimize energy consumption [23–25]. It is for example widely\nknown that the self-elected, preferred stride frequency during walking and running coincides\nwith minimal metabolic energy expenditure [18,25]; the same holds true for hopping or\nConsisten cy in repetitiv e movements\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0173 281 March 9, 2017 2 / 17\nbouncing [26,27]. In contrast, swinging the limbs at more than 2–3 Hz is energetically very\ninefficient for humans [18,24,28]. The narrow range of frequencies chosen spontaneously for\nmany repetitive activities suggests physiological and anatomical constraints as the determinant\nof preferred movement cycle rates. This emphasizes the importance of passive dynamic mech-\nanisms in understanding adopted movement frequencies [29]. For example, a movement rate\nwhich matches the resonant frequency of a ‘system’ is often spontaneously adopted for loco-\nmotor tasks [30] and results in near-minimal, or minimal, energy consumption [18,29]. High\nefficiency at resonance is linked to the interplay between the muscle tendon unit’s (MTU)\nactive components (muscle fibre shortening) and passive components (tendons, ligaments and\nconnective tissues) [31,32]. At resonance, a large proportion of length changes results from the\npassive, elastic properties of the MTU and muscle contractions are almost isometric and hence\nhighly efficient [31]. Consequently, in repetitive actions such as bouncing on the toes, at reso-\nnance hardly any active work is required from the muscles [32]. In line with these findings, a\nstudy that investigated the effect of strength training on freely adopted walking, running and\ncycling frequencies found no change in frequency after training [33], lending further support\nto the importance of the passive dynamics of the segments involved in a movement task as well\nas muscle physiology which determines optimum contraction rates. Hence, movement cycle\nrates seem to converge on a frequency determined by the musculoskeletal system with the out-\ncome being a stable, repeatable and energy-efficient movement pattern.\nThe primary aim of this study was to investigate spontaneously adopted movement cycle\nfrequency during a simple, repetitive tool use in various experimental conditions. We chose\nthe task of sawing as an example of repetitive tool using actions, and manipulated sawing con-\nditions to determine whether the spontaneously adopted sawing frequency is situation-specific\n(suggesting individual schemata) or generic (suggesting generic systems mechanics).\nMaterials and methods\nGeneral rationale\nThis manuscript describes a series of five experiments, systematically manipulating multiple\nsets of variables which might have an influence on the adopted sawing frequency. Experiments\nwere performed iteratively, where variables were chosen following the outcomes of the preced-\ning experiment (for details on each experiment, please see individual paragraphs below). Four\ndifferent saws were used across studies (Fig 1), with the ‘reference’ condition in each study\nbeing ‘normal’ horizontal sawing. Further, we added repeat conditions across and within studies\nto examine the robustness of our findings, such as repeating experiment #1 in experiment #4,\nand repeating the ‘normal’ condition at the end of a trial. Across experiments we changed the\nmaterial which participants sawed into in order to vary the ‘environment’ factor: we assumed\nthat the softer the material, the less damping would be added to the interacting oscillating sys-\ntem, and hence differences could be expected if the effect of material was large enough. Multiple\ntechniques were used for data capture: after recording data for the first study using optical\nmotion capture, we switched to accelerometers for less labour intensive data processing. For\nexperiment #5, we used optical motion capture again (in a different facility to experiment #1) to\nquantify excursion distance.\nRecruitment\nFor all experiments described in this paper, participation was voluntary and written informed\nconsent was given by participants. Experiments were approved by the University of Birming-\nham Ethics Committee. Across experiments, participants were both male and female, ranging\nin age from 18 to 50 with most participants in their late teens and early twenties. The individual\nConsisten cy in repetitiv e movements\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0173 281 March 9, 2017 3 / 17\nshown in Fig 2 in this manuscript has given written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS con-\nsent form) to publish these case details. Participants came from various backgrounds as detailed\nbelow. In experiment #3, a subset of participants comprised Engineering students taking part in\nthe study for course credit. All participants were familiar with sawing, but had varying degrees\nof experience; none of the participants was considered an expert; rather, the results reported\nhere are thought to represent a cross section of the normal population. The exception was\nexperiment #2, where jewellery students from year 1 and 3 were recruited.\nExperiment #1: Horizontal and vertical sawing into wood\nThis experiment, comparing horizontal and vertical sawing, formed the pilot work for the\npresent paper; hence the sample size was small. The experimental conditions are replicated in\nexperiment #4 with a different saw / material and larger sample size; we present this pilot here\nto highlight the consistency of findings across experiments. In this experiment, we expected\nthat vertical sawing would feel uncomfortable/unfamiliar and that participants would saw\nslower for this reason.\nFig 1.

All participants were right-handed. Horizontal and vertical sawing was\nperformed in random order. The recording lasted as long as it took a participant to saw off a\npiece of the wood. An optical motion capture system (Oqus, Qualisys, Sweden) was used to\ntrack the position of a retro-reflective marker attached to the saw tip in 3D space at 200 Hz.\nThe fixed global reference frame was defined as an orthogonal coordinate system aligned with\nthe direction of sawing, with the positive z-axis pointing up along the line of gravity. The 3D\ncoordinates of the marker were exported from Qualisys Track Manager (QTM, Qualisys, Swe-\nden) for further processing in Matlab (The MathWorks, USA). In Matlab, the data range cor-\nresponding to continuous sawing effort was selected and displacement components for a\nsingle axis extracted: displacement along the y-axis (horizontal component) for horizontal\nsawing and displacement along the z-axis (vertical component) for vertical sawing.\nExperiment #2: Sawing discs and lines into copper\nThis experiment compared sawing a straight line to a circular shape and was performed as part\nof a study into dexterity in tool use [9]. In this experiment we tested whether a stable sawing\nfrequency generalises to a different saw, task and material and a different, larger cohort of par-\nticipants. We expected a difference between the two tasks only if the (conscious) control\nneeded to rotate the material with one hand and the need to produce a specific shape would\ninteract with the intuitively chosen sawing frequency.\nFifteen students from the first and third year of Birmingham City University’s School of\nJewellery were asked to saw into a thin (approx. 1 mm) piece of copper. The task was to first\nsaw straight lines (each approximately 1 cm in length) and second a circular shape (approxi-\nmately 1 cm in diameter). The recording lasted as long as it took a participant to complete the\ntask. In this experiment, a piercing saw (blade length 8.0 cm, 81 teeth per inch, tooth height\n0.32 mm) was provided. All except one participant were right handed. Skill-levels varied due\nto prior experience, training and individual talent both within and across the two years. All\nparticipants sawed lines first, followed by a single circular shape. An instrumented saw, cus-\ntom-built in our lab for the quantification of tool use [9], was used to record acceleration at\n120 Hz. The handle contains a triaxial accelerometer mounted on the inside; the handle itself\nis formed by three equally spaced bars fitted with strain gauges which can be used to measure\ngrip force. The local reference frame was defined as an orthogonal system aligned with the\nsaw’s long-axis. Data from the accelerometer was recorded via Bluetooth through custom writ-\nten software run on a nearby laptop and saved as.csv files containing raw accelerometer data\n(in mV). Data were imported into Matlab, where the acceleration component for the axis\naligned with the saw’s handle was extracted. The data range corresponding to continuous saw-\ning effort was selected for further processing, which included brief periods of rest in sawing\nmotion during the disc sawing task while the disc was turned by hand.\nExperiment #3: Sawing with a large and small saw into wood\nIn this experiment we compared sawing with a large, coarse-toothed saw to the small saw used\nin experiment #2, again with a new participant cohort. We expected participants to use most\nof the available blade length for either saw, and to hence adopt a slower sawing frequency for\nthe large saw compared to the small saw.\nTwo groups of participants were recruited from staff and students of the University of Bir-\nmingham. The first group consisted of 20 participants who were asked to saw into a piece of\nConsisten cy in repetitiv e movements\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0173 281 March 9, 2017 5 / 17\nwood using the piercing saw from experiment #2 (blade length 8.0 cm, 81 teeth per inch, tooth\nheight 0.32 mm). The second group consisted of 16 participants who were asked to saw into a\npiece of wood using a hardpoint hand saw (blade length 50 cm, 7 teeth per inch, tooth height\napprox. 2.5 mm). Participants were timed for approximately 15 to 20 seconds, as the hardpoint\nhand saw allowed sawing through the material quicker than the piercing saw and the set time\naimed to match the two conditions. The instrumented piercing saw described in experiment\n#2 was used to record saw acceleration at 120 Hz. The hardpoint hand saw was instrumented\nwith a tri-axial accelerometer unit attached to the blade near the handle together with the\nrelated circuit board and battery, recording data at 50 Hz. The board was equipped with a\nBluetooth transmitter, and data were recorded and pre-selected as described in experiment #2.\nExperiment #4: Sawing under various conditions into a plastic pipe\nIn this experiment (Fig 2) we designed a larger number of conditions to test whether any other\nmanipulation previously not tested might affect sawing frequency: we expected a lower fre-\nquency when requested to use a longer blade length, that sawing with either hand should not\ninfluence sawing frequency since musculoskeletal properties are almost identical and that add-\ning weight to the saw would influence vertical sawing possibly causing a lower sawing fre-\nquency as a higher mass has to be moved by the same muscles.\nFifteen students from the University of Birmingham were asked to saw into a plastic pipe\n(35 mm diameter, wall-thickness 2 mm) using a hacksaw (blade length 28.5 cm, 24 teeth per\ninch, tooth height approx. 0.56 mm). All but three participants were right handed. In this\nexperiment, the following experimental conditions were presented to each participant in ran-\ndom order: 1) sawing with the preferred hand without instructions (always performed first); 2)\nsawing with the non-preferred hand without further instructions; 3) sawing vertically with the\npreferred hand; 4) using precisely half the blade length (15 cm, limited by attachments to the\nblade) while sawing with the preferred hand and 5) using precisely the full blade length (28.5\ncm) while sawing with the preferred hand. In addition, a further hacksaw was fitted with a 460\nmm wrecking bar (crow bar) in order to increase its weight/inertia; this saw weighted 1.40 kg,\nwhile the regular saw weighted 0.24 kg. With this weighted saw, two further conditions were\ntested using the preferred hand: 6) sawing normally and 7) sawing vertically. After these seven\nconditions were completed, condition 1 (sawing with the preferred hand without instructions)\nwas repeated. The whole session took approximately 15 minutes. Saws were instrumented with\na tri-axial accelerometer unit attached to the blade near the handle as described for the hard\npoint hand saw in experiment #3, recording data at 50 Hz. Participants were instructed to saw\noff a piece from the plastic tube; in case this took longer than approximately 30 seconds, partic-\nipants were allowed to stop to prevent fatigue. Data were recorded and pre-selected as\ndescribed in experiment #2.\nExperiment #5: Generic arm movements and mimed sawing\nIn experiment #5, we finally aimed to determine whether the spontaneously emerging sawing\nfrequency corresponded to a frequency chosen for any horizontal arm movement to find out\nwhether it was related to the general tool use task or emerged as some universally chosen arm\nmovement rate. Further, this experiment was designed to quantify excursion distance.\nEight members of staff from the University of Birmingham were recruited to perform the\nfollowing three tasks: 1) moving the arm forward and backward in a horizontal translation\nhowever they felt comfortable; 2) miming sawing, holding the hacksaw from experiment #4\nand 3) sawing normally into a plastic pipe, repeating condition 1) from experiment #4. Condi-\ntions 1) and 2) were timed for 60 seconds. In condition 3), participants were asked to saw off\nConsisten cy in repetitiv e movements\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0173 281 March 9, 2017 6 / 17\nmultiple sections from the pipe, which took around 30 to 45 seconds. A retro-reflective marker\nwas attached to the hand close to the carpometacarpal joint. An optical motion capture system\n(Bonita, Vicon, USA) was used to track marker position in 3D space at 100 Hz. The fixed\nglobal reference frame was defined as an orthogonal coordinate system aligned with the direc-\ntion of sawing, with the positive z-axis pointing up in line with gravity. The 3D coordinates of\nthe marker were exported from Vicon Tracker (Vicon, USA) for further processing in Matlab\n(The MathWorks, USA). In Matlab, the data range corresponding to continuous movement\nwas selected. For the calculation of frequency, the horizontal displacement component in the\ndirection of sawing was selected. For the calculation of sawing excursion, all three components\nwere used.\nData analysis\nSawing cycle frequency was calculated based on the detection of maxima in displacement sig-\nnals (Fig 3). The rationale for the approach was that sawing movement typically resembles a\nnear-sinusoidal pattern, in which a sawing cycle can be defined as the duration from one spe-\ncific event (such as a maximum) to the next. The signals extracted from optical motion capture\nand accelerometers were processed in a matching manner to ensure that results were compara-\nble across experiments and data sources. Optical motion capture and accelerometer signals\nwere offset-corrected for both methods by calculating the median value across the selected\ndata range and subtracting it from the data. For the optical motion capture data (experiment\n#1), displacement along the primary axes of movement was highpass filtered with a 4\nth\norder,\nzero-lag Butterworth filter (cut-off frequency 0.5 Hz) in order to match the filtering of the\naccelerometer data (see below) and then smoothed with a moving average filter (bin width: 10\nframes) to avoid local extrema. Accelerometer data (experiment #2 to #4) were double-inte-\ngrated and highpass filtered at each step with a 4\nth\norder, zero-lag Butterworth filter (cut-off\nfrequency 0.5 Hz) to eliminate drift arising from the integration procedure. This resulted in\nFig 3. Signal processing . Maxima detection in the signals derived from optical motion capture (top) and an\naccelerome ter (bottom) . Each maximu m (red circle) marks the start of a new sawing cycle, the time elapsed\nbetween maxima defines the sawing cycle duration.\ndoi:10.13 71/journal.pone .0173281.g003\nConsisten cy in repetitiv e movements\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0173 281 March 9, 2017 7 / 17\nuncalibrated displacement trajectories. The resulting signal was smoothed with a moving aver-\nage filter (bin width: 10 frames) in order to facilitate robust extrema detection as described\nabove. For these signals, differences between adjacent data points were calculated and maxima\ndetected as those frames where the sign of these differences changed from positive to negative\nin adjacent frames. In the rare cases where this did not work (usually due to local extrema),\nmaxima were identified through manual input. The duration of each individual sawing cycle\nwas calculated as the time between the identified maxima. Frequency was then calculated as\nthe inverse of duration. For each participant, the median (to estimate central tendency) and\ninterquartile range (IQR, to estimate within-participant variation) was calculated across all val-\nues, as distributions were sometimes skewed. Maxima timings were used to estimate the num-\nber of sawing cycles performed in each experiment by each participant.\nSawing excursion distance was calculated for each sawing cycle as the vector magnitude\nbetween the marker position at time t\n1\n(coordinates [x\n1\n,y\n1\n,z\n1\n]) and time t\n2\n(coordinates [x\n2\n,y\n2\n,z\n2\n])\nbased on maxima and minima identified from the single-axis trajectories as described above.\nStatistics\nStatistical analysis was performed in IBM SPSS Statistics 22. Results were considered signifi-\ncant for P < 0.05 unless stated otherwise. Datasets for each experiment were tested for normal-\nity using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Since three datasets significantly differed from a normal\ndistribution (studies 01V, 03S and 04NP, P \u0014 0.039), non-parametric statistics were per-\nformed. Statistics were performed for each of the five experiments separately. We performed\nwithin-subject comparisons for experiment #1, #2, #4 and #5 and an independent samples test\nfor experiment #3, since participants differed between sawing with the small and large saw.\nHence, for experiment #1 and #2, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was run, for experiment #3, a\nMann-Whitney U test was run and for experiment #4 and #5, a Friedman test was run. If the\nFriedman test indicated a significant effect of the condition on sawing frequency, pairwise Wil-\ncoxon signed-rank tests, corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction, were\nexecuted post-hoc to establish between which exact conditions the difference laid. Participant-\nspecific median and IQR values were compared using these tests. Finally, a Kruskall-Wallis\ntest was performed to test whether the different blade lengths had an effect across experiments.\nFive datasets were used for this comparison: Experiment #2—line sawing (short blade), experi-\nment #3 –both (short and very long blade), experiment #4 - ‘normal’ condition (long blade)\nand experiment #5 –‘real sawing’ (long blade).\nPredicted movements\nTo examine whether the cycle frequencies observed in this study can be predicted from the\nused blade length, we used established ‘time standards’ from the Methods Time Measurement\n(MTM) literature [34] to calculate the expected duration of generic arm movements over dis-\ntances defined by different blade lengths. These standards give the expected duration of differ-\nent arm motions over various ranges for specific aims of the movement, such as grasping,\nmoving or reaching. For the type ‘move’, case B (move object to approximate or indefinite\nlocation, weight < 1.1 kg), which is most similar to the sawing task, we fitted a power function\n(R\n2\n= 0.999) to the tabulated and published data [34] in order to predict values expected for\nblade lengths and travelled distances in the different experiments.\nResults\nIn experiments #1 to #4 participants sawed with a consistent mean (SD) cycle frequency calcu-\nlated across condition-specific median values of 2.0 (0.4) Hz.

Conditions were not significantly different for either experiment #1 or #2\n(P \u0015 0.733). Cycle frequency was 2.19 [1.22] Hz for sawing with the small saw and 1.70 [0.87]\nHz for sawing with the large saw in experiment #3, being significantly different (P = 0.026). In\nexperiment #4, sawing frequency ranged from 1.06 [0.81] Hz for sawing with a fixed-length\nlong blade to 2.50 [1.19] Hz for sawing with a fixed-length short blade (see also Fig 4). Here\nthe experimental condition had an effect on the sawing frequency (P < 0.001) as shown by a\nFriedman test. Pairwise post-hoc testing using Wilcoxon tests, however, was not able to detect\na significant difference after correction for multiple testing between any of the conditions\n(P \u0015 0.011, adjusted alpha = 0.006). The different blade lengths had no significant effect on\nsawing frequency across the five experiments described in Material and Methods (P = 0.136).\nVariation in sawing frequency (quantified as within-participant IQR) for a given participant\nand trial was low for most conditions (Fig 4, bottom): Median [IQR] within-participant varia-\ntion was 0.43 [0.20] Hz for horizontal and 1.09 [1.03] Hz for vertical sawing in experiment #1,\nwhich was significantly different (P = 0.043). Variation was 0.27 [0.19] Hz for line sawing and\n0.34 [0.22] Hz for disc sawing in experiment #2, not being significantly different (P = 0.155).\nVariation was 0.20 [0.18] Hz for sawing with the small saw and 0.46 [0.37] Hz for sawing with\nthe large saw in experiment #3, being significantly different (P = 0.003). In experiment #4, varia-\ntion ranged from 0.25 [0.15 / 0.21] Hz for sawing horizontally / with a fixed-length long blade\nto 0.45 [0.27] Hz for sawing with a fixed-length short blade.

Again\nhowever, pairwise post-hoc testing using Wilcoxon tests was not able to detect a significant dif-\nference after correction for multiple testing between any of the conditions (P \u0015 0.010, adjusted\nalpha = 0.006).\nIn experiment #5, median [IQR] cycle frequency was 1.05 [0.24] Hz for free arm move-\nments, 1.02 [0.27] Hz for mimed sawing and 2.10 [0.57] Hz for the real sawing task (Fig 5,\ntop). Median [IQR] excursion amplitude was 41.0 [6.5] cm for free arm movements, 37.5\n[11.8] cm for mimed sawing and 14.0 [3.9] cm for the real sawing task (Fig 5, bottom). For\nsawing frequency, the condition had a significant effect (P = 0.001), where sawing frequency\nwas significantly different between real sawing and free movement / mimed sawing (P = 0.012,\nadjusted alpha = 0.017). Matching this, the condition had a significant effect (P = 0.001) on the\nexcursion amplitude, which was significantly different between real sawing and free movement\n/ mimed sawing (P = 0.012, adjusted alpha = 0.017). Within-participant variation in movement\nfrequency was 0.04 [0.01] Hz for free arm movement, 0.04 [0.01] Hz for mimed sawing and\n0.22 [0.18] Hz for real sawing. Variation in excursion distance was 3.0 [1.2] cm for free arm\nmovement, 3.0 [1.8] cm for mimed sawing and 2.7 [2.7] cm for real sawing. For within-partici-\npant variation in sawing frequency, the condition had a significant effect (P = 0.001), where\nsawing frequency was significantly different between real sawing and free movement / mimed\nsawing (P = 0.012, adjusted alpha = 0.017). Variation in excursion amplitude was not signifi-\ncantly different between conditions (P = 0.902).\nWhen comparing the observed cycle frequencies to predictions made from generic arm\nmovement times [34], we found a good match of 2.3 Hz predicted for a blade length of 8 cm\n(observed: 2.1 to 2.3 Hz) in experiment #2, 1.07 Hz predicted for 28.5 cm (observed: 1.06 Hz)\nFig 5.

The only large discrepancy was noted for the constrained 15 cm blade length, with a pre-\ndiction of 1.6 Hz and an observed frequency of 2.5 Hz. For the free and mimed arm move-\nments in experiment #5, we again found a good match, predicting 0.9 Hz for the on average 40\ncm excursion (observed: 1.0 Hz) during free arm movement / mimed sawing and 1.7 Hz for\nthe on average 14 cm excursion (observed: 2.1 Hz) during real sawing.\nDiscussion\nOur results show that when sawing in unconstrained conditions, participants chose a sawing\nrhythm independent of most experimental manipulations. Used blade length appeared to be\nthe only determinant of sawing frequency, albeit not always being significant at the pairwise\nlevel due to conservative testing. The hardpoint hand saw resulted in a small drop in opera-\ntional frequency, likely in parts associated with the substantially higher and coarser distributed\nteeth of the saw. Observed movement matched expectations from generic arm movements\n[34], showing that the movement frequency and amplitude combination observed in sawing is\nin line with other, nonspecific arm movements executed over a similar distance. The only\nlarge exception observed for the 15 cm blade length (prediction: 1.6 Hz, observed: 2.5 Hz) was\nlikely due to participants sawing in this condition by using the length limiting blocks as a point\nof collision instead of decelerating the saw through muscular effort, resulting in substantial\nnoise. Our overall observed movement frequency of 2.0 Hz would correspond to a predicted\naverage used blade length of 10 cm, which is in between the blade length of the piercing saw\nused in several tasks (8 cm) and the measured excursion distance for the hacksaw (14 cm); 10\ncm is also in range of the suggested ‘used blade length’ evidenced by the collected sawdust in\nthe teeth of the hardpoint hand saw (measured after experiment completion). These findings\nsuggest that, while leaving room for small variation in the exact parameters, sawing is sponta-\nneously executed at a robust combination of frequency and excursion distance. Material prop-\nerties did not seem to cause systematic changes in sawing frequency: material varied from\nmetal in experiment #2 to wood in experiment #3 and plastic in experiment #4 and #5, where\nfor example the Young’s modulus (colloquial ‘elasticity’ or ‘stiffness’) of wood is a lot lower\nthan metal (i.e. around 1 to 2 kN/mm\n2\nradial or 11 to 14 kN/mm\n2\nparallel to the fibre for wood\ncompared to 125 kN/mm\n2\nfor copper [35]). How the observed convergence on a similar saw-\ning pattern arises within the context of the nervous system and control of muscular contrac-\ntions can only be speculated on. Broadly speaking, there are (at least) two routes for control of\nmuscle activation: either a fast, learned / pre-programmed / feedforward pattern, or slower,\nfeedback driven on-the-fly optimization using bodily sensing. Feedback control (as opposed to\nfeed-forward control) has been proposed as the mechanism controlling oscillation frequency\nduring bouncing [27], where the oscillation frequency is tuned to the resonance frequency of\nthe oscillating system over several minutes. On the other hand, research investigating the con-\ntribution of pre-programmed and feedback-based processes to an adopted stride frequency\nand speed argues that both processes play a role, with a dominant contribution of the pre-pro-\ngrammed, fast process [36,37].\nWhy 2 Hz?\nWhy do people spontaneously saw at 2 Hz? The answer may lie in intrinsic system dynamics\nof the musculoskeletal system tuned to e.g. preferred muscular contraction rates, but may\nadditionally lie in the use of available cognitive resources. It has even been hypothesized that\nin fact the human system ‘resonates’ around a 2 Hz frequency [38]. We believe that performing\nrepetitive tool use tasks at rates which match those found in locomotor tasks appears logical, as\nConsisten cy in repetitiv e movements\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0173 281 March 9, 2017 11 / 17\nthe musculoskeletal system can be assumed to already be optimized, or tuned, to perform reg-\nular locomotor tasks efficiently. Hence, cyclical muscle contractions should be efficient for\nsuch regularly performed rates. Humans commonly perform a variety of repetitive, or cyclical,\nmovements such as walking, running, hopping and cycling at rates spanning approximately\n0.8 to 3.0 Hz (see S1 Text and S1 Table, summarizing 16 studies reviewed for this paper). The\ninterquartile ranges for sawing cycle frequency were bounded between around 1 and 3 Hz,\nmatching this range. Further in line with these bounds, a model of cyclical muscle contractions\nsuggests that when applied to type I and type IIA fibres, the predicted maximum power output\noccurs at around 1.5 Hz and 3.7 Hz, respectively [39] (although, as the authors point out, this is\na slight over-estimate due to simplifying switch on/off times to zero). It has also been claimed\nthat there is evidence for 2 Hz marking the threshold beyond which agonist and antagonist\naction cannot be fully separated for hand and wrist movements [40]. Cyclical action performed\nagainst substantial resistance, such as swimming and rowing, is typically performed at lower fre-\nquencies of approximately 0.3 to 1.3 Hz (see S1 Table, summarizing nine studies reviewed for\nthis paper). Adding weight (0.24 kg vs. 1.40 kg) to the saw did not change the movement cycle\nfrequency in our study, where additional weight may be compensated for by recruiting more\nmuscle fibres. In Barnes (1980), the predicted duration for arm movements increases as a func-\ntion of weight carried, however only for a mass > 1.13 kg.\nThe principles at the level of neural muscle activation may actually be similar to those in\nmusculoskeletal dynamics: for example, a resonance model of the perceptual-motor system\n[38] peaked at a frequency of 1.8 to 2.0 Hz (0.50 to 0.55 s intervals), and neural entrainment\ncentres around 2 Hz [41]. It is interesting to note that there exists differential control of slow\nand fast movements: previously, brain activation work has consistently observed a ‘rate effect’,\nwhere brain activation is dependent on the rate of movement in a differential manner (for\nsummary see e.g. [42]). For movement frequencies \u0015 1.5 Hz in a finger tapping task, an auto-\nmatic, program-like mode is active which is computationally ‘cheap’ (albeit increasing cost\nwith increasing frequency), while for frequencies < 1 Hz, movement cycles are controlled indi-\nvidually through closed-loop feedback, with an increase in computational cost. This finding of\npossibly U-shaped brain activation curves as a function of movement frequency matches the\nU-shaped curves found for muscular energy expenditure during locomotor tasks at different\nspeeds [25]. The rate effect in brain activation has been observed in both, fMRI studies [43]\nand EEG studies [42]. A change in control strategy at around 2 Hz has also been reported for\nthe task of matching rhythms [44] or for movement frequencies in different manual tasks that\ndo or do not require sensory-motor feedback [45] and has also been speculated about in early\nwork on controlled arm movements [46]. Further, the control of eye movements when track-\ning sinusoidal signals changes at 2 Hz from target tracking to a static or erratic eye orientation\n[47,48]. These observations could suggest that repetitive movements are performed at a rate\nwhich not only minimizes muscular energy expenditure, but also minimizes brain activity in\norder to free up cognitive resources for parallel tasks. Performing repetitive movements at low\ncognitive cost would make sense, especially if matching preferred rates dictated by the bodily\nstructures. In future, it would be interesting to examine whether this hypothesis holds and\nwhether other repetitive tasks follow the same pattern.\nDifference between sawing and free arm movements\nIn experiment #5, arm movements without cutting into material were consistent across partic-\nipants, despite being half the frequency of real sawing, and results for real sawing matched the\nfindings from experiment #4 (condition 04N and 04R) for both central tendency and within-\nparticipant variation, showing that the study was repeatable. In context of the likely separation\nConsisten cy in repetitiv e movements\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0173 281 March 9, 2017 12 / 17\nof control strategy towards 2 Hz described above, we assume that the low frequency for free arm\nmovements was the result of non-automatic muscular control, while sawing was controlled auto-\nmatically. Findings remained in line with what was expected for the frequency/displacement\nrelationship of generic arm movements predicted from Methods Time Measurement data in\nBarnes (1980). The low variation in frequency both within and across participants for free arm\nmovement and mimed sawing was striking and even more pronounced than during the sawing\ntasks. The reason for this convergence is not clear: it may be the result of optimal muscle recruit-\nment, resulting in minimal energy expenditure and hence resulting in similar contraction rates\nacross participants. Since movement frequency and amplitude differed between tasks that\ninvolved sawing into material and tasks without doing so, it seems unlikely that the adopted\nbehaviour during sawing is the result of a generic movement pattern that may always be adopted\nwhen moving the arm horizontally. When moving the arm during free movement and miming,\nwe noted that participants moved the arm forward towards almost complete extension, while\njoints remained flexed during sawing. Full extension of the arm provides a structural reference\npoint, which would explain the low variation within and across participants, since participants\nhad a similar height; for children for example, one would expect different behaviour due to the\nshorter segments and scaling effects. Further research would have to explore why the specific\nand repeatable behaviour was converged on during both, free arm movements and the real saw-\ning tasks.\nMovement variability\nThe variability in sawing cycle frequency across participants was a little higher in this study\ncompared to other studies exploring simple movement tasks. For example, standard deviations\nhave been reported at 0.08 Hz for the preferred walking frequency [18], 0.1 Hz for the pre-\nferred hopping frequency [26] and 0.1 Hz for the preferred cycling frequency on a bicycle [49]\nhave been reported. In our study, the average standard deviation across the 14 conditions was\n0.7 Hz, similar to variation found in a more complex bouncing task [27,50] with a standard\ndeviation of around 0.5 Hz. In contrast, the free arm moments in experiment #5 were executed\nwith a low within-participant variation of 0.2 Hz compared to 0.6 Hz for sawing. The less fre-\nquent an activity is performed, the more it may cause variation across individuals, who may not\nuse the optimal frequency straight away. In a study into walking, running and cycling, between-\nparticipant variation was observed to increase from walking to running to cycling [33]. It has\nalso been speculated that patterns for walking and running are genetically ‘engrained’, whereas\npatterns for activities such as cycling are learned, resulting in less consistent behaviour [33]. In\nour study, the relatively short duration of the tasks, usually lasting less than a minute, may not\nhave allowed enough time for all participants to converge on an ‘optimum’ movement pattern:\nin a study into bouncing, subjects spontaneously adopted the optimal frequency only after six\nminutes engagement in the task [27]. Variation in sawing frequency within participants was\nsmall with a median (IQR) across conditions of 0.4 (0.2) Hz. Some of this variation might have\narisen from participants speeding up towards the last movement cycles when they were just\nabout to saw off a piece of material. While speeding up for the last cycles might affect the\nwithin-participant variability estimate, it would not affect the calculated median and the related\nmetrics and results, since from observation not more than around 25% of cycles would have\nbeen affected; in fact, after visual inspection, most trials are considered free of this bias.\nOutlook and generalisation\nIn the present study, we did not use domain experts; rather, we set out to investigate spontane-\nous behaviour based on a sample assumed to reflect experience levels in the general population,\nConsisten cy in repetitiv e movements\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.137 1/journal.po ne.0173 281 March 9, 2017 13 / 17\nin order to arrive at results that generalise. This means that if experiments are replicated else-\nwhere with random participants, results should be reproducible. Expert tool users, such as car-\npenters, may learn to change the movement pattern from the pattern adopted spontaneously by\nnovices to a pattern which may not minimise energy expenditure with respect to muscle recruit-\nment but be more efficient with respect to the actual outcome of the activity, such as sawing\nthrough a piece of wood in the fastest time possible by for example using the whole available\nblade length. This would be interesting to explore in future. Handedness of participants is not\nconsidered a confounding factor, as participants were asked to use their preferred hand, and\nresults from experiment #4 showed that sawing with the left or right hand did not have a signifi-\ncant effect on sawing frequency. How far do our findings extrapolate? As part of the recognition\nof David Attenborough’s achievements in light of his 90th birthday, BBC World News showed a\ncollage of his famous television moments. As part of this clip collection, an orangutan is shown\nsawing with a hardpoint hand saw. We calculated the sawing frequency from this clip and it\naverages to a mean (SD) of 2.0 (0.2) Hz, matching our finding for humans.\nConclusions\nIn a series of five experiments, we demonstrate that when acting freely, people will use a saw\nlargely independent of the saw’s dimensions and situational circumstances at a preferred cycle\nfrequency of around 2 Hz. Only in experiment #3 did a longer blade length result in a small\nbut significant change in operational frequency, which may be due to the rough teeth of this\nparticular saw. The longer blade length in experiment #4 and #5 did not result in an opera-\ntional frequency significantly different from that of the short blades, with the used blade length\nranging from 8 cm (limited by the saw) to 14 cm (observed for the 28.5 cm saw). Our findings\nmatch the selection of a preferred frequency and excursion amplitude found for example dur-\ning locomotion [51]. In contrast to the explanations of tool-use that rely on stored representa-\ntions or extraction of motor control parameters, we believe that our results lend support to the\nhypothesis that the passive dynamic behaviour of the musculoskeletal structures and optimal\nmuscle recruitment determine the cycle rate. The observed movement might hence simply\nemerge as a general behaviour resulting from bodily constraints independent of the activity\ntype. If this was the case, then the study of tools needs to be more aware of the interactions\nbetween bodily dynamics and control strategies, rather than assuming that tool use behaviour\nis the result of an individual’s cognitive approach to the task. Based on our findings of a consis-\ntent sawing frequency, we propose that—similar to other cyclical activities with specific ‘signa-\nture’ frequencies such as walking or running—repetitive actions in tool use result in a narrow\nrange of movement cycle frequencies that do not require complex control strategies or motor\nlearning, but emerge as a consequence of biomechanical constraints in context of the tool-\nenvironment-user system, which may act as a function of required external force based on\nenvironmental characteristics and the general task–such as sawing–to be executed.\nSupporting information\nS1 Dataset.
