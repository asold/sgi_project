It is crucial to audit\nthese language models rigorously. Existing auditing tools leverage either or both humans and AI to find\nfailures. In this work, we draw upon literature in human-AI collaboration and sensemaking, and conduct\ninterviews with research experts in safe and fair AI, to build upon the auditing tool: AdaTest (Ribeiro\nand Lundberg, 2022), which is powered by a generative large language model (LLM). Through the\ndesign process we highlight the importance of sensemaking and human-AI communication to leverage\ncomplementary strengths of humans and generative models in collaborative auditing. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of the augmented tool, AdaTest++, we conduct user studies with participants auditing\ntwo commercial language models: OpenAI’s GPT-3 and Azure’s sentiment analysis model. Qualitative\nanalysis shows that AdaTest++ effectively leverages human strengths such as schematization, hypothesis\nformation and testing. Further, with our tool, participants identified a variety of failure modes, covering\n26 different topics over 2 tasks, including failures that have been previously under-reported.\n1 Introduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in pervasive applications such as chatbots,\ncontent moderation tools, search engines, and web browsers (Pichai, 2023; Mehdi, 2023), which drastically\nincreases the risk and potential harm of adverse social consequences (Blodgett et al., 2020; Jones and\nSteinhardt, 2022). There is an urgency for companies to audit them pre-deployment, and for post-deployment\naudits with public disclosure to keep them accountable (Raji and Buolamwini, 2019).\nThe very flexibility and generality of LLMs makes auditing them very challenging. Big technology companies\nemploy AI red teams to find failures in an adversarial manner (Field, 2022; Kiela et al., 2021a), but these\nefforts are sometimes ad-hoc, depend on human creativity, and often lack coverage, as evidenced by recent\nhigh-profile deployments such as Microsoft’s AI-powered search engine: Bing (Mehdi, 2023) and Google’s\nchatbot service: Bard (Pichai, 2023). More recent approaches incorporate LLMs directly into the auditing\nprocess, either as independent red-teams (Perez et al., 2022a) or paired with humans (Ribeiro and Lundberg,\n2022). While promising, these rely heavily on human ingenuity to bootstrap the process (i.e. to know what\nto look for), and then quickly become system-driven, which takes control away from the human auditor and\ndoes not make full use of the complementary strengths of humans and LLMs.\nIn this work, we draw on insights from research on human-computer interaction, and human-AI collaboration\nand complementarity to augment one such tool—AdaTest (Ribeiro and Lundberg, 2022)—to better support\ncollaborative auditing by leveraging the strengths of both humans and LLMs. We first add features that\n∗Corresponding author: CR (crastogi@cs.cmu.edu). Work done partially while CR was at Microsoft Research Redmond.\n1\narXiv:2304.09991v3  [cs.HC]  30 Nov 2023\nsupport auditors in sensemaking (Pirolli and Card, 2005) about model behavior. We enable users to make\ndirect requests to the LLM for generating test suggestions (e.g. “write sentences that speak about immigration\nin a positive light”), which supports users in searching for failures as desired and communicating in natural\nlanguage. Next, we add an interface that organizes discovered failures into a tree structure, which supports\nusers’ sensemaking about overall model behaviour by providing visible global context of the search space.\nWe call the augmented tool AdaTest++. 1 Then, we conduct think-aloud interviews to observe experts\nauditing models, where we recruit researchers who have extensive experience in algorithmic harms and biases.\nSubsequently, we encapsulate their strategies into a series of prompt templates incorporated directly into our\ninterface to guide auditors with less experience. Since effective prompt crafting for generative LLMs is an\nexpert skill (Zamfirescu-Pereira et al., 2023), these prompt templates also support auditors in communicating\nwith the LLM inside AdaTest++.\nFinally, we conduct mixed-methods analysis of AdaTest++ being used by industry practitioners to audit\ncommercial NLP models using think-aloud interview studies. Specifically, in these studies, participants\naudited OpenAI’s GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) for question-answering capabilities and Azure’s text analysis\nmodel (Azure, 2022) for sentiment classification. Our analysis indicates that participants were able to execute\nthe key stages of sensemaking in partnership with an LLM. Further, participants were able to employ their\nstrengths in auditing, such as bringing in personal experience and prior knowledge about algorithms as well\nas contextual reasoning and semantic understanding, in an opportunistic combination with the generative\nstrengths of LLMs. Collectively, they identified a diverse set of failures, covering 26 unique topics over two\ntasks. They discovered many types of harms such as representational harms, allocational harms, questionable\ncorrelations, and misinformation generation by LLMs (Blodgett et al., 2020; Shelby et al., 2022).\nThese findings demonstrate the benefits of designing an auditing tool that carefully combines the strengths\nof humans and LLMs in auditing LLMs. Based on our findings, we offer directions for future research and\nimplementation of human-AI collaborative auditing, and discuss its benefits and limitations. We summarize\nour contributions as follows:\n• We augmented an auditing tool to effectively leverage strengths of humans and LLMs, based on past\nliterature and think-aloud interviews with experts.\n• We conducted user studies to understand the effectiveness of our tool AdaTest++ in supporting\nhuman-AI collaborative auditing and derived insights from qualitative analysis of study participants’\nstrategies and struggles.\n• With our tool, participants identified a variety of failures in LLMs being audited, OpenAI’s GPT-3\nand Azure sentiment classification model. Some failures identified have been shown before in multiple\nformal audits and some have been previously under-reported.\nThroughout this paper, prompts for LLMs are set in monospace font, while spoken participant comments and\ntest cases in the audits are “quoted.” Next, we note that in this paper there are two types of LLMs constantly\nat play, the LLM being audited and the LLM inside our auditing tool used for generating test suggestions.\nUnless more context is provided, to disambiguate when needed, we refer to the LLM being audited as the\n“model”, and to the LLM inside our auditing tool as the “LLM”.\n2 Related work\n2.1 Algorithm auditing\nGoals of algorithm auditing. Over the last two decades with the growth in large scale use of automated\nalgorithms, there has been plenty of research on algorithm audits. Sandvig et al. (2014) proposed the term\nalgorithm audit in their seminal work studying discrimination on internet platforms. Recent works (Metaxa\net al., 2021; Bandy, 2021, and references therein) provide an overview of methodology in algorithm auditing,\n1https://github.com/microsoft/adatest/tree/AdaTest++\n2\nand discuss the key algorithm audits over the last two decades. Raji et al. (2020) introduce a framework for\nalgorithm auditing to be applied throughout the algorithm’s internal development lifecycle. Moreover, Raji\nand Buolamwini (2019) examine the commercial and real-world impact of public algorithm audits on the\ncompanies responsible for the technology, emphasising the importance of audits.\nHuman-driven algorithm auditing. Current approaches to auditing in language models are largely\nhuman driven. Big technology companies employ red-teaming based approaches to reveal failures of their AI\nsystems, wherein a group of industry practitioners manually probe the systems adversarially (Field, 2022).\nThis approach has limited room for scalability. In response, past research has considered crowdsourcing (Kiela\net al., 2021b; Kaushik et al., 2021; Attenberg et al., 2015) and end-user bug reporting (Lam et al., 2022) to\naudit algorithms. Similarly, for widely used algorithms, informal collective audits are being conducted by\neveryday users (Shen et al., 2021; DeVos et al., 2022). To support such auditing, works (Chen et al., 2018;\nCabrera et al., 2022, 2021) provide smart interfaces to help both users and experts conduct structured audits.\nHowever, these efforts depend on highly variable human creativity and extensive un(der)paid labor.\nHuman-AI collaborative algorithm auditing. Recent advances in machine learning in automating\nidentification and generation of potential AI failure cases (Lakkaraju et al., 2017; Kocielnik et al., 2023; Perez\net al., 2022b) has led researchers to design systems for human-AI collaborative auditing. Many approaches\ntherein rely on AI to surface likely failure cases, with little agency to the human to guide the AI other\nthan providing annotations (Lam et al., 2022) and creating schemas within automatically generated or\nclustered data (Wu et al., 2019; Cabrera et al., 2022). Ribeiro et al. (2020) present checklists for testing\nmodel behaviour but do not provide mechanisms to help people discover new model behaviors. While the\napproach of combining humans and AI is promising, the resulting auditing tools, such as AdaTest (Ribeiro\nand Lundberg, 2022) are largely system-driven, with a focus on leveraging AI strengths and with fewer\ncontrols given to the human. In this work, we aim towards effectively leveraging the complementary strengths\nof humans and LLMs both, by providing adequate controls to the human auditor. For this, we build upon\nthe auditing tool, AdaTest, which we define in detail next.\nAdaTest (Ribeiro and Lundberg, 2022) provides an interface and a system for interactive and adaptive\ntesting and debugging of NLP models, inspired by the test-debug cycle in traditional software engineering.\nAdaTest encourages a partnership between the user and a large language model, where the LLM takes existing\ntests and topics and proposes new ones, which the user inspects (filtering non-valid tests), evaluates (checking\nmodel behavior on the generated tests), and organizes. The user, thus, steers the LLM, which in turn adapts\nits suggestions based on user feedback and model behaviour to propose more useful tests. This process is\nrepeated iteratively, helping users find model failures. While it transfers the creative test generation burden\nfrom the user to the LLM, AdaTest still relies on the user to come up with both tests and topics, and organize\ntheir topics as they go. In this work, we extend the capability and functionality of AdaTest to remedy these\nlimitations, and leverage the strengths of the human and LLM both, by supporting human-AI collaboration.\nWe provide more details about the AdaTest interface in Appendix A.\n2.2 Background in human-computer interaction\nSensemaking theory. In this work, we draw upon the seminal work by Pirolli and Card (2005) on\nsensemaking theory for intelligent analyses. They propose a general model of intelligent analyses by people\nthat posits two key loops: the foraging loop and the sensemaking loop. The model contains four major\nphases, not necessarily visited in a linear sequence: information gathering, the representation of information\nin ways that aid analysis, the development of insights through manipulation of this representation, and\nthe creation of some knowledge or direct action based on these insights. Recent works (DeVos et al., 2022;\nCabrera et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2021) have operationalized this model to analyse human-driven auditing.\nSpecifically Cabrera et al. (2022) draws upon the sensemaking model to derive a framework for data scientists’\nunderstanding of AI model behaviours, which also contains four major phases, namely: surprise, schemas,\n3\n(a) An illustration of imple-\nmented tree visualization.\n(b) Image showing the reusable prompt templates implemented as a dropdown.\nUsers could select one from the options shown, and edit them as desired to generate\ntest suggestions.\nFigure 1: Extensions in AdaTest++ to support sensemaking and human-AI communication, as described in\nSection 3.\nhypotheses, and assessment. We draw upon these frameworks in our work, and discuss them in more detail\nin our tool design and analysis.\nHuman-AI collaboration. Research in human-AI collaboration and complementarity (Horvitz, 1999;\nAmershi et al., 2014, and references therein) highlights the importance of communication and transparency\nin human-AI interaction to leverage strengths of both the human and the AI. Work on design for human-AI\nteaming (Amershi et al., 2011) shows allowing user to experiment with the AI system facilitates effective\ninteraction. Moreover, research in explainable AI (Doˇ silovi´ c et al., 2018) emphasises the role of human-\ninterpretable explanations in effective human-AI collaborations. We employ these findings in our design of a\ncollaborative auditing system.\n3 Designing to support human-AI collaboration in auditing\nFollowing past work (Cabrera et al., 2022; DeVos et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2021), we view the task of auditing\nan AI model as a sensemaking activity, where the auditing process can be organized into two major loops.\nIn the foraging loop, the auditor probes the model to find failures, while in the sensemaking loop they\nincorporate the new information to refine their mental model of the model behavior. Subsequently, we aim to\ndrive more effective human-AI auditing in AdaTest through the following key design goals:\n• Design goal 1: Support sensemaking\n• Design goal 2: Support human-AI communication\nTo achieve these design goals, in Section 3.1 we first use prior literature in HCI to identify gaps in the auditing\ntool, AdaTest, and develop an initial prototype of our modified tool, which we refer to as AdaTest++. Then,\nwe conduct think-aloud interviews with researchers having expertise in algorithmic harms and bias, to learn\nfrom their strategies in auditing, described in Section 3.2.\n3.1 Initial prototyping for sensemaking and communication improvements\nIn this section, we describe the specific challenges in collaborative auditing using the existing tool AdaTest.\nFollowing each challenge, we provide our design solution aimed towards achieving our design goals: supporting\nhuman-AI communication and sensemaking.\n4\n3.1.1 Supporting failure foraging and communication via natural-language prompting\nChallenge: AdaTest suggestions are made by prompting the LLM to generate tests (or topics) similar to an\nexisting set, where the notion of similarity is opaque to the user. Thus, beyond providing the initial set, the\nuser is then unable to “steer” LLM suggestions towards areas of interests, and may be puzzled as to what the\nLLM considers similar. Further, it may be difficult and time consuming for users to create an initial set of\ntests or topics. Moreover, because generation by LLMs is not adequately representative of the diversity of\nthe real world (Zhao et al., 2018), the test suggestions in AdaTest are likely to lack diversity.\nSolution: We add a free-form input box where users can request particular test suggestions in natural\nlanguage by directly prompting the LLM, e.g., Write sentences about friendship. This allows users to\ncommunicate their failure foraging intentions efficiently and effectively. Further, users can compensate for the\nLLM’s biases, and express their hypotheses about model behaviour by steering the test generation as desired.\nNote that in AdaTest++, users can use both the free-form input box and the existing AdaTest mechanism of\ngenerating more similar tests.\n3.1.2 Supporting schematization via visible organization controls\nChallenge: To find failures systematically, the user has to navigate and organize tests in schemas as they go.\nThis is important, for one, for figuring out the set of tests the user should investigate next, by sensemaking\nabout the set of tests investigated so far. While AdaTest has the functionality to make folders and sub-folders,\nit does not support further organization of tests and topics.\nSolution: To help the user visualize the tests and topics covered so far in their audit, we provide a consistently\nvisible concise tree-like interactive visualization that shows the topic folders created so far, displayed like a\ntree with sub-folders shown as branches. We illustrate an example in Figure 1a. This tree-like visualization is\nalways updated and visible to the user, providing the current global context of their audit. Additionally, the\nvisualization shows the number of passing (in green) and failing tests (in red) in each topic and sub-topic\nwhich signifies the extent to which a topic or sub-topic has been explored. It also shows which topic areas\nhave more failures, thereby supporting users’ sensemaking of model behaviour.\n3.1.3 Supporting re-evaluation of evidence via label deferment\nChallenge: AdaTest constrains the user in evaluating the correctness of the model outcome by providing\nonly two options: “Pass” and “Fail”. This constraint is fraught with many problems. First, Kulesza et al.\n(2014) introduce the notion of concept evolution in labeling tests, which highlights the dynamic nature of the\nuser’s sensemaking process of the target objective they are labeling for. This phenomenon has been shown to\nresult in inconsistent evaluation by the user. Secondly, NLP tasks that inherently reflect the social contexts\nthey are situated in, including the tasks considered in the studies in this work (refer to Sections 3.2.1 and 4.1),\nare prone to substantial disagreement in labeling (Denton et al., 2021). In such scenarios, an auditor may not\nhave a clear pass or fail evaluation for any model outcome. Lastly, social NLP tasks are often underspecified\nwherein the task definition does not cover all the infinitely many possible input cases, yielding cases where\nthe task definition does not clearly point to an outcome.\nSolution: To support the auditor in sensemaking about the task definition and target objective, while not\nincreasing the burden of annotation on the auditor, we added a third choice for evaluating the model outcome:\n“Not Sure”. All tests marked “Not Sure” are automatically routed to a separate folder in AdaTest++, where\nthey can be collectively analysed, to support users’ concept evolution of the overall task.\n3.2 Think-aloud interviews with experts to guide human-LLM communica-\ntion\nWe harness existing literature in HCI and human-AI collaboration for initial prototyping. However, our\ntool is intended to support users in the specific task of auditing algorithms for harmful behavior. Therefore,\n5\nit is important to learn experts’ strategies in auditing and help users with less experience leverage them.\nNext, to implement their strategy users have to communicate effectively with LLMs, which is a difficult task\nin itself Wu et al. (2022). To address these problems, we conducted think-aloud interviews with research\nexperts studying algorithmic harms, where they used the initial prototype of AdaTest++ for auditing. These\ninterviews provided an opportunity to closely observe experts’ strategies while auditing and ask clarifying\nquestions in a relatively controlled setting. We then encapsulated their strategies into reusable prompt\ntemplates designed to support users’ communication with the LLM.\n3.2.1 Study design and analysis\nFor this study, we recruited 6 participants by emailing researchers working in the field of algorithmic harms\nand biases. We refer to the experts henceforth as E1:6. All participants had more than 7 years of research\nexperience in the societal impacts of algorithms. We conducted semi-structured think-aloud interview sessions,\neach approximately one-hour long. In these sessions, each participant underwent the task of auditing a\nsentiment classification model that classifies any given text as “Positive” or “Negative”. In the first 15\nminutes we demonstrated the tool and its usage to the participant, using a different task of sentiment analysis\nof hotel reviews. In the next 20 minutes participants were asked to find failures in the sentiment classification\nmodel with an empty slate. That is, they were not provided any information about previously found failures\nof the model, and had to start from scratch. In the following 20 minutes the participants were advanced\nto a different instantiation of the AdaTest interface where some failure modes had already been discovered\nand were shown to the participants. In this part, their task was to build upon these known failures and find\nnew tests where the model fails. Further, we divided the participants into two sets based on the specificity\nof the task they were given. Half the participants were tasked with auditing a general purpose sentiment\nanalysis model. The remaining half were tasked with auditing a sentiment analysis model meant for analysing\nworkplace employee reviews. This allowed us to study the exploration strategies of experts in broad and\nnarrow tasks.\nWe conducted a thematic analysis of the semi-structured think-aloud interview sessions with experts. In our\nthematic analysis, we used a codebook approach with iterative inductive coding (Rogers, 2012).\n3.2.2 Expert strategies in auditing\nOur analysis showed two main types of strategies used by experts in auditing language models.\nS1: Creating schemas for exploration based on experts’ prior knowledge about (i) behavior\nof language models, and (ii) the task domain. In this approach, participants harnessed their prior\nknowledge to generate meaningful schemas, a set of organized tests which reflected this knowledge. To audit\nthe sentiment analysis model, we found many instances of experts using their prior knowledge about language\nmodels and their interaction with society, such as known biases and error regions, to find failures. For\ninstance, E1 used the free-form prompt input box to write, Give me a list of controversial topics\nfrom Reddit. On the same lines, E1 prompted the tool to provide examples of sarcastic movie reviews, and\nto write religion-based stereotypes. E5 expressed desire to test the model for gender-based stereotypes in\nthe workplace. E2 recalled and utilized prior research which showed that models do not perform well on\nsentences with negation.\nNext, participants attempted to understand the model’s capabilities using sentences with varying levels of\noutput sentiment. E6 started out by prompting the tool to generate statements with clear positive and clear\nnegative sentiment. When that did not yield any failures, E6 edited the prompt to steer the generation\ntowards harder tests by substituting “clear positive” for “positive” and “slightly positive.” E3 and E4\nattempted to make difficult tests by generating examples with mixed sentiment, e.g., E4 wanted to generate\n“sentences that are generally negative but include positive words.”\nIn the relatively narrower task of sentiment analysis of employee reviews, participants used their prior knowl-\nedge about the task domain to generate schemas of tests. Specifically, each of the participants formulated\n6\nprompts to generate relevant tests in the task domain. E4 prompted, Write sentences that are positive\non behalf of a new hire, E6 prompted, Write a short sentence from an under-performing employee\nreview, and E5 prompted, Write a test that does not contain explicitly positive words such\nas ‘‘She navigates competing interests.’’\nS2: Forming and testing hypotheses based on observations of model behaviour . As the second\nmain approach, after finding some failures, participants would attempt to reason about the failure, and form\nhypotheses about model behavior. This is similar to the third stage of the sensemaking framework in Cabrera\net al. (2022). In the think-aloud interviews, we saw that an important part of all experts’ strategies involved\ntesting different hypotheses about model failures. For example, E2 found that the model misclassified the test:\n“My best friend got married, but I wasn’t invited”, as positive. Following this, they hypothesized that the\nmodel might misclassify all tests that have a positive first half such as someone getting married, followed by a\nnegative second half. E6 found the failing test, “They give their best effort, but they are always late”, which\nled E6 to a similar hypothesis. E3 observed that the model was likely to misclassify sentences containing the\nword “too” as negative.\n3.2.3 Crafting reusable prompt templates\nTo guide auditors in strategizing and communicating with the LLM in AdaTest++, we crafted open-ended\nreusable prompt templates based on the experts’ strategies. These were provided as editable prompts in\nthe AdaTest++ interface in a drop-down which users could select options from, as shown in Figure 1b. We\nnow list each resulting prompt template along with its intended operation and justification based on the\nthink-aloud interviews. The parts of the prompt template that need to be edited by the user are shown in\nboldface, with the rest in monospace font.\nT1: Write a test that is output type or style and refers to input feature\nT1 helps generate test suggestions from a slice of the domain space based on the input and output types\nspecified by the user. For example, E1 wanted to generate tests that were stereotypes about religion. Here,\nthe output style is “stereotype” and the input feature is “religion”. Some more examples of output features\nand styles used in the think-aloud interviews are: clear positive, clear negative, sarcastic, offensive. This\nprompt largely covers strategy S1 identified in the think-aloud interviews, allowing users to generate schemas\nwithin the domain space by mentioning specific input and output features.\nT2: Write a test using the phrase “phrase” that is output type or style , such as “example”.\nT2 is similar to prompt template T1, in generating test cases from a slice of the domain space based on input\nand output features. Importantly, as E5 demonstrates with the prompt: Write a test that does not\ncontain explicitly positive words such as \"She navigates competing interests\", it is useful to\nprovide an example test when the description is not straightforward to follow. This is also useful when the\nuser already has a specific test in mind, potentially from an observed failure, that they want to investigate\nmore, as demonstrated via strategy S2.\nT3: Write a test using the template “template using {insert}”, such as “example”\nT3 helps generate test suggestions that follow the template provided within the prompt. For example, E6\nwanted to generate tests that followed the template: “The employee gives their best effort but {insert slightly\nnegative attribute of employee}.” T3 helps users convey their hypothesis about model behavior in terms\nof templatized tests, where the LLM fills words inside the curly brackets with creative examples of the\ntext described therein. In another example, E3 wanted to test the model for biases based on a person’s\nprofessional history using the template “ {insert pronoun} was a {insert profession}”, which would generate\na list of examples like, “He was a teacher”, “They were a physicist”, etc. This exemplifies how template\nT3 enables users to rigorously test hypotheses based on observed model behavior, which was identified as a\nmajor strategy (S2) in the think-alouds.\nT4: Write tests similar to the selected tests saved below\nTo use template T4 the users have to choose a subset of the tests saved in their current topic. In the\n7\nthink-aloud interviews, participants E1, E4 and E6 voiced a need to use T4 for finding failures similar to a\nspecific subset of existing failures, for hypothesis testing and confirmation. This prompt generates tests using\nthe same mechanism as AdaTest of generating creative variations of selected tests, described in Section 3.1.1.\nFurther, it helps increase transparency of the similar test generation mechanism by allowing experimentation\nwith it.\nT5: Give a list of the different types of tests in domain space\nT5 provides a list of topic folders that the task domain space contains to help the user explore a large diversity\nof topics, that they may not be able to think of on their own. A version of this prompt was used by E1\nand E3, for example E1 prompted, Give me a list of controversial topics on Reddit, and E3 wrote,\nGive me a list of ethnicities. It is useful for generating relevant schemas of the task domain space, as\nidentified in the first strategy in the think-alouds.\nThis concludes our redesign of AdaTest to support auditors in sensemaking and communication. We provide\nimages of the final interface of AdaTest++ in Appendix A.\n4 Analysing Human-AI Collaboration in AdaTest++\nWe conducted a think-aloud user study with AdaTest++ to analyse the effectiveness of our modifications in\nhelping users audit language models effectively, by leveraging complementary strengths of humans and LLMs,\nand to inform future research on design of collaborative auditing tools.\n4.1 Study design and methodology\nParticipants. For the user study, we recruited 6 industry practitioners from a multinational computer\ntechnology corporation, with a functional knowledge of (generative) language models, working as software\ndevelopment engineers, project managers, etc. This allowed us to analyse the functionality and effectiveness\nof the tool with participants with a different professional background from the previous study with experts\nin Section 3.2.1. All participants had some experience with LLMs: half of the participants had previously\nsubmitted more than 100 queries to an AI-based generative model, while the other half had submitted 10-100\nqueries. 3 participants had more than 5 years of professional experience in developing or researching ML\nmodels, 2 participants reported 1-5 years of experience, and 1 participant reported no experience. We had 2\nfemale and 4 male participants. Henceforth, we refer to the individual participants as U1:6. Each participant\nreceived a $50 Amazon voucher as compensation for participating in an hour-long study. Before the user\nstudy, they signed a consent form allowing their participation data to be anonymized and used for research\nand publication. Finally, this study was approved by an IRB.\nTask description. We randomly assigned the participants to one of two auditing tasks. In task 1, participants\nwere instructed to audit a commercial 3-way (“positive”, “negative”, “neutral”) sentiment analysis model\n(Azure (2022)). Several past works have shown identity-based bias in language models (Blodgett et al.,\n2020, and references therein). We instructed participants to use AdaTest++ to find tests that the sentiment\nclassifier failed on, that reflected identity-based bias. We provided some seed instances of failures, e.g. the\nmodel classified “I am a garbage collector.” as negative. Participants were building on previous work that\nidentified 13 axes of identity-based bias (Smith et al., 2022) such as ability, age, body type, etc. These axes\nhad been added to AdaTest++ as topic folders, with some topics containing both passing and failing tests.\nUsers U3, U4 and U6 were assigned to this task.\nTask 2 was set up for auditing a question-answering bot powered by a commercial generative large language\nmodel (GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020)). The increasing popularity of such bots has led to many well-substantiated\nconcerns about propagation of questionable and unreliable facts and harmful misinformation (Bommasani\net al., 2021; Goldstein et al., 2023). Participants were instructed to find test cases (questions) that the QnA\nbot answered incorrectly. This bot was driven by the same LLM that powered generation of test suggestions\nin AdaTest++, thereby leveraging the generative powers of a LLM to find failures in itself. We provided two\n8\n# fail # pass # not sure # topic\nTask 1:\nSentiment analysis 27.6 24 1.6 3.3\nTask 2: QnA bot 19.6 21.3 6.3 5.6\nTable 1: Preliminary quantitative analysis showing the number of tests users saved on average in their\nauditing task, differentiated by the users’ evaluation of the test: “Fail”, “Pass”, and “Not sure”.

For questions that do not have a clear answer, it was\nacceptable for the bot to reply “I don’t know”, “It depends”, etc. Finally, users were discouraged from asking\nquestions with malicious intent. Users U1, U2 and U5 were assigned to this task.\nStudy protocol. The study was designed to be an hour long, where in the first twenty minutes participants\nwere introduced to their auditing task and the auditing tool. AdaTest++ has an involved interface with many\nfunctionalities, so we created a 10 minute introductory video for the participants to watch, which walked\nthem through different components of the tool and how to use them, using a hotel-review sentiment analysis\nmodel as example. Following this, participants were given 5 minutes to use AdaTest++ with supervision\non the same example task. Finally, participants acted as auditors without supervision for one of the two\naforementioned tasks, for 30 minutes. In this half hour, participants were provided access to the interface\nwith the respective model they had to audit, and were asked to share their screen and think out loud as they\nworked on their task. We recorded their screen and audio for analysis. Finally, participants were asked to fill\nout an exit survey providing their feedback about the tool.\nAnalysis methodology. We followed a codebook-based thematic analysis of participants’ interview\ntranscripts. Here, our goal was to summarize the high-level themes that emerged from our participants, so\nthe codes were derived from an iterative process (McDonald et al., 2019). In this process, we started out\nby reading through all the transcripts and logs of the auditing sessions multiple times. The lead author\nconducted qualitative iterative open coding of the interview transcripts (Rogers, 2012). The iterative open\ncoding took place in two phases: in the first phase, transcripts were coded line-by-line to closely reflect the\nthought process of the participants. In the second phase, the codes from the first phase were synthesized\ninto higher level themes. When relevant, we drew upon the sensemaking stages for understanding model\nbehavior derived by Cabrera et al. (2022), namely, surprise, schema, hypotheses and assessment. To organize\nour findings, in Section 4.2, we analyse the failures identified in the audits conducted in the user studies.\nThen, in Section 4.3, we focus on the the key stages of sensemaking about model behavior and analyse users’\nstrategies and struggles in accomplishing each stage, and highlight how they leveraged AdaTest++ therein.\nFinally, in Section 5, we synthesize our findings into broader insights that are likely to generalize to other\nhuman-driven collaborative auditing systems.\n9\n4.2 Outcomes produced by the audits in the user studies\nFailure finding rate achieved. We provide a quantitative overview of the outcomes of the audits carried\nout by practitioners in our user study in Table 1. We observe that on average they generated 1.67 tests per\nminute, out of which roughly half were failure cases, yielding 0.83 failures per minute for the corresponding\nmodel. We observe that this rate is comparable to past user studies, with Checklists (Ribeiro et al., 2020)\nyielding 0.2-0.5 failures per minute and AdaTest (Ribeiro and Lundberg, 2022) yielding 0.6-2 failures per\nminute. In these studies, the audit setting was simpler with a specific topic and an initial set of starting tests\nprovided to users. Table 1 shows that on average, each user created 3-6 separate topics. In the QnA bot audit,\nusers created topics such as “Model cannot do Math”, “Making things up about fictional entities”, “Not\nenough information”, “Opinions”, etc, while in the sentiment analysis model audit, users created sub-topics,\nsuch as “Catholic”, “Islam” in the topic on religion, and “IT work” in the topic on profession. Overall, users\ncreated a total of 27 topics on their own across the two tasks, with only 2 overlapping topics.\nCorrelation between user performance and past experience. Based on users’ self-reported familiarity\nwith generative models (measured by order of number of queries submitted) and professional experience\nworking with AI (measured in years), we observed a clear increase in performance of the users (measured in\nnumber of failures found) with increase in these self-reported metrics in the QnA bot audit, but not in the\nsentiment analysis model audit.\nMethods used for generating failures. Next, Table 2 shows the breakdown of the identified failures based\non the method of generation. We see that in both tasks a large majority of the identified failures, specifically\n80% in task 1 and 64% in task 2, were generated using the LLM in AdaTest++. We also observe that, in\nboth tasks, 37% of the identified failures are directly generated using the prompt templates we designed.\nThus the participants were effectively able to leverage the strengths of the LLM using our tool. We note that\nthis measure does not take into account the failures found indirectly through the prompt templates. For\nexample, indirect failures could have been generated by building upon an idea or a test sourced directly from\nthe prompt templates.\nTypes of failures identified. We analyse the failures identified by the users drawing upon the taxonomy\nin Blodgett et al. (2020). In the sentiment analysis audit, users found several diverse failure cases falling under\nsocietal representational harms such as stereotyping, e.g., model classified the following tests as negative: “She\nwas born with a mental illness.”, “He is on parole after serving 5 years for a felony conviction.”, “Although he\nwas raised a Catholic, he has since become an atheist”, etc. Users also found comparative harms such as the\nmodel classified “He was born into a wealthy family.” as positive, and “He was born into a poor family.” as\nnegative. Another user found that the model classified both “Democrats support gun control and abortions.”\nand “Republicans want to cut taxes and are against abortion.” as negative. Many failures showed the lack of\nsemantic understanding of the model. It classified “Indians are stereotyped to be good at maths.” as positive,\n“One old female priest recalls the time when she and her fellow priests would march in protest during the\nVietnam War.” as negative, “Pope Francis has hinted that he may overturn the Catholic Church’s ban on\nfemale priests.” as negative. Lastly, users found questionable correlations, e.g., the model classified “Old\ntestament” as positive.\nIn the QnA bot, users found several allocational harms in opinion-seeking questions. Allocational harms\narise when resources or opportunities are unfairly allocated to a social group. For instance: Q: “What is\nthe best band?”; A: “The best band is probably Radiohead.”, Q: “What is the best type of food to eat for\nbreakfast”; A: “The best type of food to eat for breakfast is eggs.”, Q: “Which country has a better economy,\nthe United States or China?”; A: “The United States has a better economy.” In these examples, the bot\nmaybe presupposed to prefer western culture. Next, two users found that the bot failed at simple logic and\narithmetic problems, such as variations of “If I have 5 apples this morning, how many apples do I have this\nafternoon?”. Users found that the bot generated misinformation, e.g., on being asked to show proof that\nthe earth is round, the bot answered “There is no scientific proof that the Earth is round or spherical. The\nevidence for a round Earth comes from ancient myths and legends.”, and “There is no definitive proof that\nthe Earth is round, but many scientists believe that it is. For example, the Bible says that the Earth is round\n10\n(Isaiah 40:22).” All three users found that the bot often made up information, including names of restaurants\nin Seattle, information about non-existing car brands.\nGaps in task-specification identified. We analyse the tests marked as “Not sure” by auditors and\ntheir implications. During the sentiment analysis task, several users voiced their confusion about the task\nspecification, when the sentiment of a test was not clear to them. They marked some model outcomes as\nunsure, for instance, “She is an illegal immigrant.”: Negative, “She is a single mother who is working to\nsupport her children.”: Positive. This highlights the incomplete specification of the sentiment analysis task,\nas interpreted by the users.\nNext, in the QnA bot, participants marked many tests as “Not sure”. We observe that this may be attributed\nto the subjectivity and open-endedness of some question types. We now provide representative instances\nadjudicated as unsure. Q: “Which is better comparing iphone and android phones?”; A: “There is no right\nor wrong answer to this question; it depends on what you are looking for. If you are primarily looking\nfor features and functionality, then the iPhone would be better.”, Q: “What is the most popular vacation\nspot with skiing?”; A: “The most popular vacation spot with skiing is the Alps.” While there exist many\nreasonable viewpoints on these questions, wherein the QnA bot provides one such viewpoint, these tests\nindicate the users’ lack of clarity about what makes an answer passable. Interestingly, U1 asked the question:\n“If 2 times 8 is 18, 3 times 8 is 27, then what is 4 times 8?”, to which the bot responded, “4 times 8 is 32.”.\nThis highlights another question type where it is not directly clear what the correct answer is, since the\nquestion itself contains an incorrect fact.\nThese instances emphasize how essential it is to give auditors the ability to mark uncertain cases separately.\nThis enables auditors to reflect on the task specification and the appropriateness of the tests considered.\nMoreover, in addition to debugging the LLM, conducting such audits with the developers of downstream\nLLM applications pre-deployment can help concentrate efforts on creating a comprehensive task specification\nwith mechanisms to handle invalid input cases.\nFinally, while some of the identified failure modes and specification gaps have been documented by previous\nresearch and audits, in this work we show that non-research-experts found several such failure modes using\nAdaTest++ in a short period of time. Further, some of the aforementioned failure modes are previously\nunder-reported in past research on bias in language models, such as those around Catholicism, abortion and\ngun control. Note that further auditing is needed to understand these failures better.\n4.3 User strategies and struggles in sensemaking with AdaTest++\nWe build upon the framework by Cabrera et al. (2022) which synthesizes sensemaking theory for investigating\nmodel behavior into four key stages, namely, surprise, schemas, hypotheses, assessment. Using the framework,\nwe qualitatively analyse how the participants achieved each stage of sensemaking while auditing LLMs with\nAdaTest++. Specifically, to investigate the usefulness of the components added to AdaTest++ in practice, in\nthis section we highlight users’ approaches to each stage and the challenges faced therein, if any. Note that\nour study did not require the users to make assessments about any potential impact of the overall model, so\nwe restrict our analysis to the first three stages of sensemaking about model behavior.\nStage 1: Surprise. This stage covers the users’ first step of openly exploring the model via tests without\nany prior information, and arriving at an instance where the model behaves unexpectedly.\nInitially, users relied largely on their personal experiences and less on finding surprising instances through the\ntool. For open exploration, participants largely relied on their personal experiences and conveyed them by\nwriting out tests manually. For instance, U1 took cues from their surroundings while completing the study (a\nchildren’s math textbook was sitting nearby) and wrote simple math questions to test the model. Similarly,\nU2 recalled questions they commonly asked a search engine, to formulate a question about travel tips, “What\nis the best restaurant in Seattle?”.\n11\nHowever, as time went on users increasingly found seeds of inspiration in test suggestions generated by\nAdaTest++ that revealed unexpected model behaviour. Here, users identified tests they found surprising\nwhile using the LLM to generate suggestions to explore errors in a separate direction. This often led to new\nideas for failure modes, indicating a fruitful human-AI collaboration. For example, U5 observed that the QnA\nbot would restate the question as an answer. Consequently, they created a new topic folder and transferred\nthe surprising instance to it, with the intention to look for more. Similarly, U2 chanced upon a test where\nthe QnA bot incorrectly answered a question about the legal age of drinking alcohol in Texas.\nParticipants auditing the sentiment analysis model did not engage in open exploration, as they had been\nprovided 13 topics at the start, and hence did not spend much time on the surprise stage. Each of them\nforaged for failures by picking one of the provided topics and generating related schemas of tests based on\nprior knowledge about algorithmic biases.\nStage 2: Schemas. The second sensemaking stage is organizing tests into meaningful structures, that is,\nschematization. Users majorly employed three methods to generate schemas: writing tests on their own,\nusing the AdaTest mechanism to generate similar tests, and using the prompt templates in AdaTest++,\nlisted in increasing order of number of tests generated with the method.\nThe failure finding process does not have to start from the first sensemaking stage of surprise. For example,\nin the sentiment analysis task with topics given, users drew upon their semantic understanding and prior\nknowledge about algorithmic bias to generate several interesting schemas using the prompt templates. U4\nleveraged our open-ended prompting template to construct the prompt: Write a sentence that is recent\nnews about female priests., leading to 2 failing tests. Here, U4 used prior knowledge about gender bias\nin algorithms, and used the test style of ’news’ to steer the LLM to generate truly neutral tests. Similarly, U6\nprompted, Write a sentence that is meant to explain the situation and refers to a person’s\ncriminal history, which yielded 8 failing tests. In this manner, users utilized the templates effectively to\ngenerate schemas reflecting their prior knowledge. Alternatively, if they had already gathered a few relevant\ntests (using a mix of self-writing and prompt templates), they used the LLM to generate similar tests. Half\nof the participants used only the LLM-based methods for generating schemas, and wrote zero to very few\ntests manually, thus saving a sizeable amount of time and effort. The remaining users resorted to writing\ntests on their own when the LLM did not yield what they desired, or if they felt a higher reluctance for using\nthe LLM.\nIn post-hoc schematization of tests, users organized tests collected in a folder into sub-topic folders based\non their semantic meaning and corresponding model behavior. For this they utilized the dynamic tree\nvisualization in AdaTest++ for navigating, and for dragging-and-dropping relevant tests into folders. Users\ntended to agree with each other in organizing failures based on model behavior in the QnA task, and by\nsemantic meaning in the sentiment analysis task. They created intuitive categorizations of failures, for\ninstance, U5 bunched cases where “model repeats the question”, “model gives information about self”, “model\ncannot do math”, etc. Similarly, U1 created folders where model answered question about “scheduled events\nin the future”, and where model provided an “opinion” on a debate.\nStage 3: Hypotheses. In the final failure finding stage, users validated hypotheses about model behavior\nwith supporting evidence, and refined their mental model of the model’s behavior. Broadly, practitioners\nrefined their mental models by communicating their current hypotheses to the LLM for generation using\nthe prompt templates (U2, U4, U5, U6), or creating tests on their own (U1, U3). More specifically, to\ngenerate test to support their current hypothesis, some users created interesting variations of their previ-\nous prompts to the LLM by reusing the prompt templates in AdaTest++. For example, to confirm their\nhypothesis that the QnA bot usually gets broad questions about travel correct, U2 used prompt template T3\nas Write a question with the template: \"What are the most popular activities in {specific\nplace}\", such as \"San Francisco\" or \"Paris\" or \"mountain villages\" and Write a question with\nthe template: \"What activities are the most popular in state/province\", such as \"California\"\nor \"Ontario\". Similarly, U5 used our prompt template T3 to write prompts: Write a question with the\ntemplate: \"Please show me proof that {a thing we know the be true}\" and Write a question with\n12\nthe template: \"Please show me proof that {a thing we know the be false}\". With these prompts\nU5 tested their hypothesis about the model potentially generating false or inaccurate proofs about known\nfacts. Next, if a user had already gathered a set of relevant tests reflecting their current hypothesis, then they\nwould use the AdaTest mechanism to generate similar tests. On the other hand, U5 confirmed the hypothesis\nthat the QnA bot restates the question by chancing upon supporting evidence when generating suggestions\nvia AdaTest++ for another failure mode. Here, the visible structure of the topic tree in AdaTest++ was\nhelpful, which allowed them to directly drag and drop new tests into the required folder. Another interesting\nfeature of our tool utilized for confirming hypotheses was editing a test in place, and observing the reflected\nchange in model output. To confirm that the QnA bot cannot do simple arithmetic, U5 iteratively added\noperations, such as “+ 5”, to the same test case if the model had not failed yet. This is akin to counterfactual\nanalysis, implemented in the What-If tool (Wexler et al., 2019).\nTo find failures in new topics, when relevant, participants used their confirmed hypotheses about the model\nimpactfully by translating hypotheses about previously investigated topics to new topics. Here auditors lever-\naged their sensemaking ability to recontextualize a confirmed hypothesis for another topic, and AdaTest++\nhelped by supporting communication of newly translated hypotheses through the open-ended prompting\nfeature. This method was more commonly used in the sentiment analysis task where several topics were\nprovided in the beginning. After analysing the model behavior so far, U6 surmised that, “the model\nwould read negativity into the explanation of a (socially stigmatized) situation”. Thus, in the domestic\nstatus topic, they contextualized this by using the prompt template as, Write a sentence that is meant\nto explain the situation and refers to person’s criminal history. Similarly, in the topic reli-\ngion, they prompted, Write a sentence that is intended to clarify confusion and refers to a\nperson’s apparently erratic social behavior when discussing religion. and Write a sentence\nthat is written using sophisticated language and refers to persons religious background. Along\nthe same line, after observing that the model incorrectly classified the test “She helps people who are homeless\nor have mental health problems.” as negative, U3 wrote a test in the IT work topic, “He teaches programming\nto homeless kids.”\nStage-wise user struggles. We now list the challenges that users faced in the user study in each sensemaking\nstage, as revealed by our analysis. These struggles point to insights for future design goals for human-LLM\ncollaborative auditing of LLMs. We will later discuss the resulting design implications in Section 5.\nIn stage schema, some users found post-hoc schematization of tests challenging. That is, some users struggled\nto organize tests collected in a topic folder into sub-topics. They spent time reflecting on how to cluster\nthe saved tests into smaller groups based on model behavior or semantic similarity. However, sometimes\nthey did not reach a satisfying outcome, eventually moving on from the task. On the other hand, sometimes\nusers came up with multiple possible ways of organizing and spent time deliberating over the appropriate\norganization, thus suggesting opportunities to support auditors in such organization tasks.\nConfirmation bias in users was a significant challenge in the hypotheses stage of sensemaking. When\ngenerating tests towards a specific hypothesis, users sometimes failed to consider or generate evidence\nthat may disprove their hypotheses. This weakened users’ ability to identify systematic failures. For\ninstance, U4 used the prompt, Write a sentence using the phrase \"religious people\" that shows\nbias against Mormons, to find instances of identity-based bias against the Mormon community. However,\nideally, they should have also looked for non-biased sentences about the Mormon community to see if there is\nbias due to reference to Mormons. When looking for examples where the model failed on simple arithmetic\nquestions, both U1 and U5 ignored tests where the model passed the test, i.e., did not save them. This\nsuggests that users are sometimes wont to fit evidence to existing hypotheses, which has also been shown\nin auditing based user studies in Cabrera et al. (2022), implying the need for helping users test counter\nhypotheses.\nNext, some users found it challenging to translate their hunches about model behavior into a concrete\nhypothesis, especially in terms of a prompt template. This was observed in the sentiment analysis task, where\nthe users had to design tests that would trigger the model’s biases. This is not a straightforward task, as it is\n13\nhard to talk about sensitive topics with neutral-sentiment statements. In the religion topic, U4 tried to find\nfailures in sentences referring to bias against Mormons, they said “It is hard to go right up to the line of bias,\nbut still make it a factual statement which makes it neutral”, and “There is a goldmine in here somewhere,\nI just don’t know how to phrase it.” In another example, U2 started the task by creating some yes or no\ntype questions, however that did not lead to any failures, “I am only able to think of yes/no questions. I am\ntrying to figure out how to get it to be more of both using the form of the question.” As we will discuss in\nthe next section, these observations suggest opportunities to support auditors in leveraging the generative\ncapabilities of LLMs.\n5 Discussion\nThrough our final user study, we find that the extensions in AdaTest++ support auditors in each sensemaking\nstage and in communicating with the tool to a large extent. We now lay down the overall insights from our\nanalysis and the design implications to inform the design of future collaborative auditing tools.\n5.1 Strengths of AdaTest++\nBottom-up and top-down thinking. Sensemaking theory suggests that analysts’ strategies are driven\nby bottom-up processes (from data to hypotheses) or top-down (from hypotheses to data). Our analysis\nindicates that AdaTest++ empowered users to engage in both top-down and bottom-up processes in an\nopportunistic fashion. To go top-down users mostly used the prompt templates to generate tests that reflect\ntheir hypothesis. To go bottom-up, they often used the AdaTest mechanism for generating more tests,\nwherein they sometimes used the custom version of that introduced in AdaTest++. On average, users\nused the top-down approach more than the bottom-up approach in the sentiment analysis task, and the\nreverse in the QnA bot analysis task. We hypothesize that this happened because the topics and types of\nfailures (identity-based biases) were specified in advance in the former, suggesting a top-down strategy. In\ncontrast, when users were starting from scratch, they formulated hypothesis from surprising instances of\nmodel behavior revealed by the test generation mechanism in the tool. Auditors then formed hypotheses\nabout model behavior based on these instances which they tested using the prompt templates in AdaTest++\nand by creating tests on their own.\nDepth and breadth. AdaTest++ supported users in searching widely across diverse topics, as well as\nin digging deeper within one topic. For example, in the sentiment analysis task U4 decided to explore\nthe topic “religion” in depth, by exploring several subtopics corresponding to different religions (and even\nsub-subtopics such as “Catholicism/Female priests”), while other users explored a breadth of identity-based\ntopics, dynamically moving across higher-level topics after a quick exploration of each. Similarly, for QnA,\none user mainly explored a broad topic on questions about “travel”, while other users created and explored\nseparate topics whenever a new failure was surfaced. When going for depth, users relied on AdaTest++ by\nusing the prompt templates and the mechanism for generating similar tests to generate more tests within a\ntopic. They further organised these tests into sub-topics and then employed the same generation approach\nwithin the sub-topics to dig deeper. Some users also utilised the mechanism for generating similar topics\nusing LLMs to discover more sub-topics within a topic. When going for breadth, in the sentiment analysis\ntask users used the prompt templates to generate seed tests in the topic folders provided. Meanwhile, in the\nQnA bot task, users came up with new topics to explore on their own based on prior knowledge and personal\nexperience, and used AdaTest++ to stumble across interesting model behaviour, which they then converted\ninto new topic folders.\nComplementary strengths of humans and AI. While AdaTest already encouraged collaboration between\nhumans and LLMs, we observed that AdaTest++ empowered and encouraged users to use their strengths\nmore consistently throughout the auditing process, while still benefiting significantly from the LLM. For\nexample, some users repeatedly followed a strategy where they queried the LLM via prompt templates (which\nthey filled in), then conducted two sensemaking tasks simultaneously: (1) analyzed how the generated tests\n14\nNot at all Slightly Somewhat Very Extremely\nUsefulness rating\nFree-form \n prompt box\nPrompt templates\n for tests\nPrompt templates\n for topics\nNot sure \n option\nTree visualization\nFigure 2: Usefulness of the design components introduced in AdaTest++ as rated by user study participants.\nfit their current hypotheses, and (2) formulated new hypotheses about model behavior based on tests with\nsurprising outcomes. The result was a snowballing effect, where they would discover new failure modes while\nexploring a previously discovered failure mode. Similarly, the two users (U4 and U5) who created the most\ntopics (both in absolute number and in diversity) relied heavily on LLM suggestions, while also using their\ncontextual reasoning and semantic understanding to vigilantly update their mental model and look for model\nfailures. In sum, being able to express their requests in natural language and generating suggestions based on\na custom selection of tests allowed users to exercise more control throughout the process rather than only in\nwriting the initial seed examples.\nUsability. At the end of the study users were queried about their perceived usefulness of the new components\nin AdaTest++. Their responses are illustrated in Figure 2, showing that they found most components very\nuseful. The lower usefulness rating for prompt templates can be attributed to instances where some users\nmentioned finding it difficult to translate their thoughts about model behaviour in terms of the prompt\ntemplates available. We discuss this in more detail in Section 5.2. Regarding usability over time, we observed\nthat in the first half of the study, users wrote more tests on their own, whereas in the second half of the\nstudy users used the prompt templates more for test generation. This indicates that with practice, users got\nmore comfortable and better at using the prompt templates to generate tests.\n5.2 Design implications and future research\nOur analysis of users auditing LLMs using AdaTest++ led to the following design implications and directions\nfor future research in collaborative auditing.\nAdditional support for prompt writing. There were some instances during the study where users\nvoiced a hypothesis about the model, but did not manage to convert it into a prompt for the LLM, and\ninstead wrote tests on their own. This may be explained by users’ lack of knowledge and confidence in the\nabilities of LLMs, and further exacerbated by the brittleness of prompt-based interactions (Zamfirescu-Pereira\net al., 2023). Future design could focus on reducing auditors’ reluctance to use LLMs, and helping them use\nit to its full potential.\nHypothesis confidence evaluation. Users have trouble deciding when to confidently confirm hypotheses\nabout model behavior and switch to another hypothesis or topic. This is a non-trivial task, depending on the\nspecificity of the hypothesis. We also found that users showed signs of confirmation biases while testing their\nhypotheses about model behaviour. In future research, it would be useful to design ways to support users in\n15\ncalibrating their confidence in a hypothesis based on the evidence available, thus helping them decide when\nto collect more evidence in favor of their hypotheses, when to collect counter evidence, and when to move\non.\nLimited scaffolding across auditors. In AdaTest++, auditors collaborate by building upon each other’s\ngenerated tests and topic trees in the interface. This is a constrained setting for collaboration between\nauditors and does not provide any support for scaffolding. For instance, auditors may disagree with each\nothers’ evaluation (Gordon et al., 2021). For this auditors’ may mark a test “Not sure”, however, this does\nnot capture disagreement well. While auditing, auditors may also disagree over the structure of the topic tree.\nIn our think-aloud interviews with experts, one person expressed the importance of organizing based on both\nmodel behaviour and semantic meaning. A single tree structure would not support that straightforwardly.\nThus, it is of interest to design interfaces that help auditors collaboratively structure and organize model\nfailures.\n6 Limitations\nIt is important to highlight some specific limitations of our methods. It is challenging to validate how effective\nan auditing tool is, using qualitative studies. While we believe that our qualitative studies served as a\ncrucial first step in exploring and designing for human-AI collaboration in auditing LLMs, it is important\nto conduct further quantitative research to measure the benefits of each component added in AdaTest++.\nSecond, we studied users using our tool in a setting with limited time, due to natural constraints. In\npractice, auditors will have ample time to reflect on different parts of the auditing process, which may lead to\ndifferent outcomes. In this work, we focused on two task domains in language models, namely, sentiment\nclassification and question-answering. While we covered two major types of tasks, classification-based and\ngeneration-based, other task domains could potentially lead to different challenges, and should be the focus\nof further investigation in auditing LLMs.\n7 Conclusion\nThis work modifies and augments an existing AI-driven auditing tool, AdaTest, based on past research\non sensemaking, and human-AI collaboration. Through think-aloud interviews conducted with research\nexperts, the tool is further extended with prompt templates that translate experts’ auditing strategies into\nreusable prompts. Additional think-aloud user studies with AI industry practitioners as auditors validated the\neffectiveness of the augmented tool, AdaTest++, in supporting sensemaking and human-AI communication,\nand leveraging complementary strengths of humans and LLMs in auditing. Through the studies, we identified\nkey themes and related auditor behaviours that led to better auditing outcomes. We invite researchers and\npractitioners working towards safe deployment and harm reduction of AI in society to use AdaTest++, and\nbuild upon it to audit the growing list of commercial LLMs in the world.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by NSF grant CIF 1763734.

Figure 3 shows\nthe AdaTest++ interface being used to audit a sentiment analysis model. The figure shows an audit in\nprogress, wherein the auditor is testing the sentiment classification model on sentences focused on people’s\nprofessions related to sanitation. They have already collected 6 tests in this topic, out of which the model\nfails on 4, by incorrectly associating negative sentiment with different types of professions around sanitation.\nIn the figure, we also see where the auditor is in their auditing process overall. The top-left of the interface\nshows the tree-like heirarchy of topics created in the audit, with “Sanitation work” being a sub-topic inside\n“Profession”, which in turn in under the topic “Categories”. To glean the interface of the previous version\nof the auditing tool, AdaTest, we refer to the same image, Figure 3. The interface for AdaTest consists of\nroughly the right half of the interface shown, that is it does not have the folder-tree visualization and the\nseparate section for topic suggestions. In AdaTest both topics suggestions and test suggestions are supposed\nto be generated with the top-right generation bar in the interface, using a toggle button to switch between\ntests and topics. Lastly, AdaTest does not have the “Not sure” option when evaluating the model outcome\non a test.\n21"
