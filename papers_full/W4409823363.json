  "abstract": "ChatGPT-4 + RAG was able to answer 1,023 questions from the OrthoWizard question bank at the same accuracy as Orthopedic surgeons. Both ChatGPT-4 + RAG and orthopedic surgeons had superior accuracy on these specialty exam questions compared to ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5. Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly accurate in its ability to answer orthopaedic surgery test questions with the guidance of orthopaedic surgery textbooks. RAG enables an LLM to effectively cite its sources after providing an answer to a question, which is an important tool for the integration of LLMs to orthopaedic surgery education and can function as a valuable tool for anyone studying for an orthopedic examination.",
