Business practice shows that, often, different process models are em-\nployed in the various phases of the Business Process Management life cycle,\neach providing a different paradigm for capturing and representing the business\nprocess domain. Recently, signiﬁcant efforts have been made to overcome the dis-\nintegration of process models by providing complementary language standards\nfor process design (BPMN) and execution (BPEL), based on the claim that these\nlanguages are semantically integrated. However, the conceptual mapping between\nboth languages remains unclear, thus it is undecided whether any BPMN diagram\ncan be transformed to BPEL. In this paper we argue that there is conceptual mis-\nmatch between BPMN and BPEL that needs to be identiﬁed in order to guide the\nlanguage integration process semantically. In our analysis we take into account\nthe various perspectives of the Business Process Management life cycle, in par-\nticular business and technical analyst perspectives. Our approach is generic and\ncan also be utilized as a guiding framework for identifying conceptual mismatch\nbetween other business process modeling languages.\n1 Introduction\nIn theory, Business Process Management (BPM) efforts follow a certain life cycle [1]\nthat idealizes the phases of development and deployment of business processes into the\nstages of design, implementation, enactment, and evaluation. In principle, the design\nphase involves the development of conceptual process models from abusiness analyst\nperspective. As a second step, these models serve as input totechnical analysts con-\ncerned with the development of technical process models, i.e., implementation mod-\nels in the form of executable workﬂow speciﬁcations. These speciﬁcations then serve\nas templates for the enactment of process instances deployed on a workﬂow engine.\nLastly, the execution of a process is monitored and evaluated to guide the revision and\nimprovement of the process models as part of another iteration of the life cycle.\nIn business practice, however, the transition between these phases is often broken.\nAs the process design and execution stages usually employ different modeling lan-\nguages, this translation is prone to semantic ambiguities [1]. This may cause the loss\nof design considerations within the execution models. We refer to such undesirable\ncases asconceptual mismatchbetween process modeling languages deployed in differ-\nent phases of the BPM life cycle. Accordingly, the transition between the phases seems\nto be an important prerequisite to make the process management life cycle work, in\nparticular, between business analyst and technical analyst models [1, 2].\nThe Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) [3] has been developed with the\nambition to bridge the gap between business analyst and technical analyst by providing\na standard visual notation for executable BPEL processes and by also specifying a for-\nmal mapping between BPMN to BPEL. In fact, the speciﬁcation document states that\n”BPMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business process design\nand process implementation.” [3, p. 1]. However, as we will discuss during the course\nof this paper, the translation of BPMN to BPEL is far from trivial.\nSpeciﬁcally, we argue that mapping issues arise from conceptual mismatch between\nthe two process modeling languages based on the assumption that the languages differ\nin expressive power, which in turn hinders the translation of models between these\nlanguages. Accordingly,the ﬁrst and foremost objective of this paperis to discuss how\nconceptual mismatch between business analyst and technical analyst process models\ncan be identiﬁed. Despite the focus on BPMN and BPEL we seek to deliver a generic\nsolution that builds on established evaluation theories in the ﬁeld of process modeling.\nForthcoming from this discussion, as a second contribution of this paper we provide\nguidance for the translation of process models in the form of abstract transformation\nstrategies that we deem promising for overcoming the identiﬁed mismatch.\nWe proceed as follows: in Section 2 we brieﬂy introduce BPEL and BPMN. Also,\nin Section 2.3 we discuss existing studies on the correspondence between BPMN and\nBPEL, which show that there appears to be signiﬁcant mismatch between the lan-\nguages that hinders if not counteracts translation speciﬁcations. In Section 3 we then de-\nrive a multi-perspective method for identifying conceptual mismatch between business\nprocess modeling languages and apply it to BPMN and BPEL (Sections 3.1, 3.2, and\n3.3). We close in Section 4 by drawing some conclusions from our work.\n2 Background & Related Work\n2.1 BPEL4WS\nThe Business Process Execution Language for Web Services [4], in its essence, is an\nextension of imperative programming languages with constructs speciﬁc to the BPM\ndomain, in particular web service implementations. Version 1.1 of BPEL was released\nin 2003 and its version 2.0 is currently in process of standardization with OASIS. A\nBPEL process deﬁnition speciﬁes the technical details of a workﬂow that offers a com-\nplex Web Service build from a set of elementary Web Services. The most important\nconcepts of a BPEL process are variables, partnerLinkTypes, basic and structured activ-\nities, as well as handlers.Variables store process data and messages that are exchanged\nwith Web Services.PartnerLinkTypes deﬁne the mutual required port types of a mes-\nsage exchange by declaring which partner acts according to which role deﬁned in a\npartner link.Basic Activitiesspecify the operations which are performed in a process.\nThese include Web Service operations like invoke, receive, or reply. There are further\nactivities for assigning data values to variables (assign) or wait to halt the process for\na certain time interval.Structured Activities are utilized for the deﬁnition of control\nﬂow, e.g., to specify concurrency of activities (using ﬂow), alternative branches (e.g.\nvia switch), or loops (while). Structured activities can be nested and links can be used\nto express synchronization constraints between activities.Handlers can be deﬁned in\norder to respond to the occurrence of a fault, an event, or if a compensation has been\ntriggered. For further details on BPEL refer to the speciﬁcation [4].\n2.2 BPMN\nThe nature of executable languages such as BPEL renders them less suited for direct\nuse by humans to design, manage, and monitor the business processes that are enacted\nby process-aware information systems. In order to provide a standard visual notation\nfor business processes deﬁned in an executable process language, the Business Process\nModeling Notation in its version 1.0 was ﬁrst released in May 2004 and in February\n2006 approved by OMG as a ﬁnal adopted speciﬁcation [3]. It has been the intention of\nthe BPMN designers to develop a modeling technique that supports (a) typical process\nmodeling activities for bothbusiness and technical analysts and (b) the straightforward\nmapping to executable workﬂow speciﬁcations in BPEL.\nThe complete BPMN speciﬁcation deﬁnes thirty-eight distinct language constructs\nplus attributes, grouped into four basic categories of elements.Flow Objects, such as\nevents, activities and gateways, are the most basic elements used to create Business\nProcess Diagrams (BPDs).Connecting Objectsare used to inter-connect Flow Objects\nthrough different sorts of arrows.Swimlanes are used to group activities into separate\ncategories for different functional capabilities or responsibilities (e.g., different roles\nor organizational departments).Artefacts may be added to a diagram where deemed\nappropriate in order to display further related information such as processed data or\nother comments. For further details on BPMN refer to the speciﬁcation [3].\n2.3 Related Work on the Correspondence between BPMN and BPEL\nThe recent momentum on BPMN and BPEL in industry practice has triggered signiﬁ-\ncant related research on these languages. In this section we focus on work that studies\nthe correspondence between these two seemingly complementary languages.\nTrying to support the claim that BPMN provides a visualization mechanism for\nBPEL, subsection 11 of the BPMN speciﬁcation [3, pp. 137–204] presents a mapping\nbetween BPMN and BPEL; however, it is rather informally given in prose; a precise\nalgorithm and a deﬁnition of required structural properties is missing. An example\nfor how a mapping could work is given in [5], however, it is rather simple and the\nfeasibility of such a mapping in the general case has not been demonstrated yet. It is\nalso worthwhile noting that some available software such as Telelogic’s System Archi-\ntect (www.telelogic.com/popkin/) support the generation of BPEL code from\nBPMN diagrams, but only for a limited subset of BPMN.\nFrom an academic perspective, recent work has led to the proposal of transformation\nstrategies for process models, with focus often given to the case of BPMN and BPEL.\nIn [6] a general approach is presented to translate standard workﬂow models (refer to\n[7]) to BPEL by exploiting the BPEL construct ’event handler’. However, as the au-\nthors admit, this approach only holds for a core subset of BPMN and UML Activity\nDiagrams. Later, this approach has been adopted to the speciﬁc context of BPMN and\nBPEL [8]. Again, this approach relies on the discovery of process patterns in BPMN\nmodels, which are tried to be mapped onto BPEL structured activities. While this ap-\nproach, too, is not yet at a stage where it holds for more advanced BPMN models, it is\nclosely related to our forthcoming discussion as we speciﬁcally take into account the\nmismatch between BPMN and BPEL with respect to the representation of such control\nﬂow patterns. Another interesting approach is discussed in [9], where the authors dis-\ncuss different strategies for translating graph-oriented models (like BPMN) to block-\noriented speciﬁcations (like BPEL). These strategies have different perks and perils,\nnevertheless, we deem them a suitable starting point for devising concrete mappings\nbased on an identiﬁcation and understanding of the mismatch between the languages;\nhence, we will refer back to them later in this paper.\n3 Conceptual Mismatch between BPMN and BPEL\nAs the discussion of related work reveals, existing transformation strategies falter when\nit comes to deﬁning general mappings. We argue that conceptual mismatch exists that\nwe assume to be a root cause for the translation problems. Our forthcoming discussion\nrests on two observations in this context:\n– BPEL and BPMN come from different backgrounds (technical analyst versus ad-\ndress business analyst). Thus, they employ different paradigms for capturing rele-\nvant aspects of business processes, which in turn leads to the manifestation of con-\nceptual mismatch with respect to the semantic expressiveness of these languages.\n– BPEL and BPMN are employed in different stages of the BPM life cycle. Hence,\nthe requirements of both stages need to be taken into consideration when identify-\ning potential conceptual mismatch.\nBased on these observations we argue that, speciﬁcally, the different BPM lifecy-\ncle perspectives need to be taken into consideration when devising a transformation\nbetween process models.\nIn particular, from a business analyst perspective, the transition between BPMN\nand BPEL must preserve the semantic information about the represented domain, viz.,\nit should minimize if not avoid loss of semantic representation information. In this\nregard, Wand and Weber’s work [10] is widely acknowledged as a framework of real-\nworld domains concepts that modeling languages should be able to represent. In other\nwords, a transition between languages should establish a high extent ofmatching do-\nmain representation capabilitiesbetween the two languages. From a technical analyst\nperspective, the underlying workﬂow execution engine determines the speciﬁcation of\nprocesses. In this regard, Kiepuszewski et al. [7] state that control ﬂow is a central as-\npect of a business process that needs to be sufﬁciently supported by any given language.\nTherefore, a transition between languages should establish a high extent ofmatching\ncontrol ﬂow support. Beyond that, several authors in the ﬁeld [6, 9] state that the under-\nlying process representation paradigm, i.e., block-oriented vs. graph-oriented process\nrepresentation, is another source of conceptual mismatch between process modeling\nlanguages. While both domain representation capabilities and control ﬂow support per-\nmit statements aboutwhether certain relevant aspects of a process can be expressed,\nthe process representation paradigm inﬂuenceshow such aspects can be expressed.\nForthcoming from this argumentation, a method for identifying the conceptual mis-\nmatch between business and technical analyst process models must be able to identify\nall three types of conceptual mismatch. We will employ two established evaluation\nframeworks, namelyRepresentation Theory[10, 11] (Section 3.1) for the speciﬁcation\nof domain representation capability mismatch, and theWorkﬂow Patterns framework\n[12] (Section 3.2) for the speciﬁcation of control ﬂow support mismatch. In addition\nto these established theories, Section 3.3 introduces a mismatch identiﬁcation method\nbased on a set oftransformation strategies[9] that can potentially be used to translate\nprocess models into another.\nThe selection of the mentioned evaluation frameworks can be reasoned by their\nreasonable maturity, their rigorous development, their structured evaluation approach\nand foremost by their established track record in the ﬁeld of process modeling. For\noverviews refer, for instance, to [13] and [14], respectively. In particular, as we seek to\ndeliver a general contribution beyond the case of BPMN and BPEL, the high level of\ndissemination of these theories in the ﬁeld of process modeling reasons our selection,\nas it allows for a wider uptake of our approach to cases of other process modeling\nlanguages that have previously been evaluated (e.g., BPML and WSCI).\n3.1 Identifying Domain Representation Capability Mismatch\nEvaluation using Representation Theory, exemplarily [10, 11], rests on the assumption\nthat computerized information systems are essentially representations of real world sys-\ntems and that IS models must hence contain the necessary representations of real world\nconstructs including their properties and interactions. The BWW representation model\n(short: the BWW model) contains four clusters of constructs that are deemed necessary\nto faithfully providecomplete and clear representations of the semantics of information\nsystems domains: things including properties and types of things; states assumed by\nthings; events and transformations occurring on things; and systems structured around\nthings. For a more complete description refer, for instance, to [13].\nEvaluation of modeling languages by means of Representation Theory seeks to re-\nveal construct deﬁcit within languages, which inhibits them from making statements\nabout certain domain aspects [11]. We use this type of evaluation to investigate only\nthose types of construct deﬁcit in a particular language (e.g., BPMN) that another lan-\nguage (e.g., BPEL) is able to express and argue that this particular form of deﬁcit consti-\ntutes a mismatch that in turn potentially impacts the translation of models between these\nlanguages. This means that if a more expressive process modeling language features a\nrepresentation construct that is not supported in a less expressive process modeling lan-\nguage, then the translation of the modeled process to the less detailed language will be\nat cost of losing expressive power and thus, semantic information about the represented\ndomain.\nFor the purpose of this paper, we draw on the individual analyzes of BPMN [15]\nand BPEL [16] and provide a cluster-oriented discussion of the differences between\nBPMN and BPEL in terms of their construct deﬁcit (see Table 1). Representation The-\nory offers a systematic analytical method, overlap analysis [10, 16], for a thorough and\nmore detailed evaluation of the completeness and overlap of domain representations in\na combination of languages. We must consider such an evaluation out of scope for this\npaper; however, we see an interesting and important research challenge in such an over-\nlap analysis in order to comprehensively clarify the type of mismatch between BPMN\nand BPEL.\nTable 1.

In this table, a “+”\nindicates that the respective language provides one construct supporting the representa-\ntion of the respective BWW model construct, a “++” indicates a support for the BWW\nmodel construct by more than one language construct and a “–” indicates a lack of\nsupport for the respective BWW model construct.\nAs can be seen from Table 1, there are a number of potential domain representation\ncapability mismatches between BPMN and BPEL, indicated by varying support for the\nBWW model constructs. The following paragraphs discuss some of these discrepancies\nwith respect to a potential translation of process models from BPMN to BPEL.\nTranslation of things A thing denotes the elementary notion in Representation The-\nory. The perceived world is constituted of things, either imaginary or real, that can be\ngrouped into sets and species of things (class and kind, respectively). Table 1 reveals\nthat BPMN is capable of representing things, classes, and kinds of things. However,\nBPEL only supports the representation of classes of things, viz., BPEL can only make\nsemantic statements about groups of things but not speciﬁc instances. This means that\nobject instances in a BPD, e.g., a speciﬁc organizational entity, a speciﬁc business part-\nner or a speciﬁc application system, possibly need to be generalized to classes of in-\nstances, i.e., to a more aggregate level. On the other hand, the rather limited and general\nrepresentation of properties of things in BPMN can be broken down into more special-\nized subtypes of properties in BPEL (see Table 1).\nTranslation of states A state of a thing is a vector of all the property values of a thing\nat a given point of time. Table 1 reveals that both BPMN and BPEL lack expressive\npower for modeling states assumed by things. While this ﬁnding may be problematic\nin general [13], it does not denote a area of concern with respect to translating BPMN\ndiagrams to BPEL as both languages basically share the same (in-) capabilities with\nregards to explicit state representation.\nTranslation of events and transformations The occurrence of anevent changes the\nstate of a thing. Atransformation is the mapping between two states of a thing. Ta-\nble 1 reveals that BPMN has more expressive power than BPEL for the representation\nof events and transformations occurring on things. However, there seems to be a high\nextent of redundancy of BPMN in terms of transformation and event modeling [15],\nviz., BPMN offers many overlapping constructs and thus lacks orthogonality. This goes\nalongside with the ﬁnding that a translation to BPEL potentially needs to map certain\ndedicated event subtypes within BPMN to a single event type of BPEL (for instance,\nexternal events). Transformations, however, are more differentiated in BPEL, implying\nthat transformation representations in BPMN potentially need to be annotated with fur-\nther information or attributes to sufﬁciently specify a mapping to an appropriate BPEL\nconstruct.\nTranslation of systems Things can be composed to asystem, which may have sub-\nsystems and interfaces to the environment of the system. Table 1 reveals that BPMN’s\nsupport for the modeling of systems structured around things excels the support pro-\nvided by BPEL. Thus, a BPMN speciﬁcation of the system to be developed, especially\nthe demarcation from its environment (system environment) and its disaggregation into\nsubsystems (system decomposition), might not be unambiguously translatable into ex-\necutable BPEL speciﬁcations and may thus require extra modeling and speciﬁcation\neffort to avoid misinterpretations of the resulting BPEL models. In particular, the map-\nping of the BPMN Pool and Lane constructs to the BPEL Partner construct will require\nattention as the semantics of Pool and Lane seem to be more extensive than any BPEL\ncounterpart.\n3.2 Identifying Control Flow Support Mismatch\nThe development of the Workﬂow Patterns framework (www.workflowpatterns.\ncom) was triggered by a bottom-up analysis and comparison of workﬂow management\nsoftware. The goal was to bring insights into the expressive power of the underlying\nprocess execution languages. This work identiﬁed 20control ﬂow patterns[12] that\nspecify atomic chunks of behavior capturing some speciﬁc process control require-\nments. The identiﬁed patterns span from simple to complex control ﬂow scenarios and\nprovide a taxonomy for the control ﬂow perspective of workﬂows and processes. This\ntaxonomy, in turn, has been widely used as a benchmark for analysis and comparison\nof process speciﬁcation and execution languages.\nHere we use the Workﬂow Patterns framework to draw conclusions as to the control\nﬂow support mismatch between BPMN and BPEL, drawing on the individual analyzes\nof BPMN [14] and BPEL [17]. Table 2 summarizes the ﬁndings from both analyzes.\nIn this table, a “+” indicates a direct support for a pattern, a “+/–” indicates a partial\nsupport and a “–” indicates a lack of support.\nTable 2.

Cancel Case + +\nTable 2 reveals a number of mismatches between BPMN and BPEL with regards to\nthe support for various control ﬂow concepts. The following paragraphs discuss some\nof these discrepancies, again in a cluster-oriented manner, with respect to a potential\ntranslation of process models from BPMN to BPEL.\nTranslation of basic, state-based, and cancellation patterns Table 2 reveals that\nBPMN and BPEL both support patterns 1–5 and 16–20 in the same manner. This means\nthat the representations of these control ﬂow patterns in BPMN should be unambigu-\nously translatable to BPEL. This ﬁnding supports the approach taken in [6, 8], in which\nmappings between BPMN and BPEL are deﬁned based on their support for various\ncontrol ﬂow patterns.\nTranslation of advanced synchronization patterns Table 2 reveals that BPMN pro-\nvides almost full support for patterns 6–9. BPEL, however, lacks support for multi-\nple merges and discriminators. In particular, BPEL does not support the invocation of\nsub-processes [17], which, however, can be supported by BPMN. A speciﬁc problem\nis BPEL’s missing support for the discriminator pattern, i.e., points in the workﬂow\nprocess that wait for one of the incoming branches to complete before activating the\nsubsequent activity. Hence, discriminators used in BPMN require considerable effort in\ntranslating them to statements that (a) are expressible in BPEL and (b) bear the same\nsemantics as to the handling of control ﬂow.\nTranslation of structural patterns BPEL does not support arbitrary cycles. TheWhile\nactivity can only capture structured cycles, i.e., loops with one entry point and one exit\npoint. Again, this is a potential area of concern when translating arbitrary cycles from\nBPMN to BPEL code with equivalent control ﬂow semantics.\nTranslation of multiple instances patterns Table 2 reveals that BPMN and BPEL\nboth support patterns 12, 13 and 15 in the same manner but not pattern 14. This means\nthat the BPMN representation of a workﬂow with multiple instances (where a number\nof instances of a given activity are initiated, and these instances are later synchronized,\nbefore proceeding with the rest of the process)\n3 needs to be translated into a less ex-\npressive form in BPEL4WS and hence, some desired control ﬂow support and design\nconsiderations for the modeled process are prone to getting lost.\n3.3 Identifying Process Representation Paradigm Mismatch\nWe argue that a transformation of models must consider not only representational capa-\nbilities and control ﬂow pattern support, but also the underlying process representation\nparadigm. In this context, there are essentially two paradigms to depict processes in\na process modeling language: graph-oriented and block-oriented representation [6, 9].\nBPMN follows agraph-oriented paradigm using arcs to deﬁne a partial order of ac-\ntivities and gateways to express split and join behavior. BPEL utilizes ablock-oriented\nparadigm to express control ﬂow via nested structured activities enhanced with some re-\nstricted graph concepts: in a BPEL process, arbitrary synchronization can be expressed\nwith links as long as the links are acyclic. Cycles are only allowed if they are modeled\nas structured loops using the ’While’ activity.\nIn [9], graph-based languages like BPMN and languages similar to BPEL are ab-\nstracted to so-calledprocess graphsand BPEL control ﬂow, respectively, in order to\n3 For pattern 14, the number of instances is known at some stage during run time, but before the\ninitiation of the instances has started.\nidentify transformation strategies and constraints for the application of these strategies.\nIn this context, a process graph is calledstructured, if split gateways match a join of\nthe same type, and if loops are entered at one XOR join and exited at one XOR split.\nFurthermore, a process graph isacyclic if no node can be reached from itself. A BPEL\nprocess is structured if it does not include any links. Some transformation strategies\nare only applicable for process models that fulﬁl certain properties (see Table 3). For\na formal deﬁnition of structured and cyclic process graphs as well as structured BPEL\ncontrol ﬂow refer to [9]. This reference also deﬁnes algorithms for each of the four\ntransformation strategy that will be sketched in the following.\nTable 3. Transformation strategies and applicable models\nTransformation Strategies\nfrom BPMN to BPEL\nStructured\nBPMN\nAcyclic\nBPMN\nAll\nBPMN\nTransformation Strategies\nfrom BPEL to BPMN\nStructured\nBPEL\nAll\nBPEL\nElement-Preservation - + - Flattening + +\nElement-Minimization - + - Hierarchy-Preservation + -\nStructure-Identiﬁcation + - - Hierarchy-Maximization + +\nStructure-Maximization + + -Transformation Strategies from BPMN to BPEL All four transformation strate-\ngies (see Table 3) require that all cycles of the BPMN process model are structured\nloops with an entering XOR join and an exiting XOR split. The idea of theElement-\nPreservation Strategyis to map all BPMN elements to suitable BPEL elements nested\nin a BPEL ﬂow and deﬁne control ﬂow with links. Gateways are mapped to BPEL\nempty activities that serve as target and source for multiple input (join) or output links\n(split). TheElement-Minimization Strategytakes the result of the Element-Preservation\nStrategy and replaces the empty activities with links containing transition conditions.\nThe Structure-Identiﬁcation Strategyworks similar to the transformation proposed in\nthe BPMN speciﬁcation [3]. Structured blocks can be identiﬁed via graph reduction\nrules deﬁned in [9]. This strategy is only applicable if all control ﬂow can be mapped\nto BPEL structured activities. If not, theStructure-Maximization Strategycan be ap-\nplied to derive a BPEL process with as many structured activities as possible nested\nin a ﬂow for additional synchronization constraints. As Table 3 emphasizes, there is\nno strategy to generate BPEL from an arbitrary BPMN graph because BPEL does not\npermit modeling of arbitrary cycles.\nTransformation Strategies from BPEL to BPMN The transformation from BPEL\nto BPMN imposes restrictions only for one strategy. TheFlattening Strategy can be\nutilized to transform any BPEL control ﬂow to BPMN. BPEL structured activities are\nﬂattened to gateways and arcs without any nesting. TheHierarchy-Preservation Strat-\negy can be applied if the descriptive semantics of structured activities have to be pre-\nserved in the resulting BPMN. Each type of structured activity is mapped to a respective\nsubprocess in BPMN. TheHierarchy-Maximization Strategymaps BPEL structured ac-\ntivities to sub-processes if there is no link crossing its borders. Table 3 shows that ar-\nbitrary BPEL processes can be mapped to BPMN using the ﬂattening or the hierarchy-\nmaximization strategy.\n4 Contributions & Conclusions\nThis paper discussed conceptual mismatch between BPMN and BPEL. We used a gen-\neral multi-perspective method for identifying conceptual mismatch between process\nmodeling languages employed in different stages of the BPM life cycle. In particular,\nour identiﬁcation method applies established evaluation theories and innovative trans-\nformation strategies in order to identify potential mapping issues in the form of:\n– Domain Representation Capability Mismatch: We showed how Representation The-\nory can be used to compare the representational capabilities of different process\nmodeling languages in terms of divergences in the expressiveness of various as-\npects of domain semantics.\n– Control Flow Support Mismatch: We showed how the Workﬂow Patterns Frame-\nwork can be used to identify discrepancies between process modeling languages in\nterms of their support for various aspects of control ﬂow.\n– Process Representation Paradigm Mismatch: We showed how different representa-\ntion paradigms underlying process modeling languages require different transfor-\nmation strategies and we sketched out the implications of four different strategies.\nOur analysis of the conceptual mismatch between BPMN and BPEL reveals that\nBPMN provides a much richer set of modeling constructs. A translation from technical\nBPEL to BPMN is therefore less a problem than in the opposite direction. On the other\nhand, BPMN is meant to be utilized as a visual notation for BPEL processes, but, as\nsome of the BPMN constructs cannot be expressed in BPEL, a translation would imply a\nloss of information. For example, the missing BPEL support for a range of control ﬂow\npatterns that BPMN can support may, in a translation from BPMN to BPEL, lead to\nexecution semantics that were not intended in the conceptual model. As a consequence,\neither process modeling in BPMN has to be restricted to those constructs that have an\nequivalent in BPEL, or a remodeling might be necessary on the level of BPEL in order\nto handle untranslatable constructs. In order to make the business process life cycle\nwork, it seems to be a better option to restrict BPMN rather than to extend BPEL, as\nextensions of the latter may not be supported by existing standard compliant process\nengines.\nAs to directions to further research, we perceive this work to be a starting point for\na more detailed analysis of BPMN and BPEL (and other combinations of languages)\nusing the approach presented. In particular, we see a need to comparatively assess the\nvarying domain representation capabilities, and control ﬂow support, of BPMN and\nBPEL in more detail, for example, by means of overlap analysis [10, 16].\nReferences\n1. zur Muehlen, M., Rosemann, M.: Multi-Paradigm Process Management.
