  "abstract": "In neoteric the term harmonics distortion for power quality improvement and also for future purpose plays a vital role with consequential basic. Use of Non-Linear loads are dominating in every sector and Harmonic currents generated by non-linear loads generates extra losses in transformer. Standard transformers are designed to tackle the losses generated by linear loads. These unwanted extra losses cause the overheating and premature failure in transformers. This is a very sensitive problem of transformers. General solution to this problem is to de-rate the transformer. K-factor is an index used to de-rate the transformer to tackle the non-linearity effect. But de-rating is not an energy efficient and scientific solution. Prefect solution is to use active / passive filters and power quality conditioners. But these are not used by general customer due to these costs and other reasons. Technical solution to this problem is to change or modify the design to accommodate the extra losses due to non-linear loads. These specially designed transformers are K-Rated Transformers. Basic design parameters of K-rated transformer are to minimize the harmonic current losses and have an additional thermal capacity to handle extra losses. Main objective of this paper is to study the effect of K-factor concept due to non-linear loads, generation of harmonics currents and use of K-Rated Transformer instead of De-rating the transformer. K-rated transformers allow operation up to nameplate capacity without de-rating",
