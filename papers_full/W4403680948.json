  "abstract": "Legal knowledge involves multidimensional heterogeneous knowledge such as legal provisions, judicial interpretations, judicial cases, and defenses, which requires extremely high relevance and accuracy of knowledge. Meanwhile, the construction of a legal knowledge reasoning system also faces challenges in obtaining, processing, and sharing multisource heterogeneous knowledge. The knowledge graph technology, which is a knowledge organization form with triples as the basic unit, is able to efficiently transform multisource heterogeneous information into a knowledge representation form close to human cognition. Taking the automated construction of the Chinese legal knowledge graph (CLKG) as a case scenario, this paper presents a joint knowledge enhancement model (JKEM), where prior knowledge is embedded into a large language model (LLM), and the LLM is fine-tuned through the prefix of the prior knowledge data. Under the condition of freezing most parameters of the LLM, this fine-tuning scheme adds continuous deep prompts as prefix tokens to the input sequences of different layers, which can significantly improve the accuracy of knowledge extraction. The results show that the knowledge extraction accuracy of the JKEM in this paper reaches 90.92%. Based on the superior performance of this model, the CLKG is further constructed, which contains 3480 knowledge triples composed of 9 entities and 2 relationships, providing strong support for an in-depth understanding of the complex relationships in the legal field.",
