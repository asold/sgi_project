  "abstract": "With the development of artificial intelligence and deep learning, deep neural networks have become an important method for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries. In this paper, drawing inspiration from the transformer sequence-to-sequence task’s transformation capability, we propose a fusion model that integrates the functions of the stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and the Transformer model in order to improve the performance of RUL prediction. Firstly, the health factors under three different conditions are extracted from the measurement data as model inputs. These conditions include constant current and voltage, random discharge, and the application of principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Then, SDAE is responsible for denoising and feature extraction, and the Transformer model is utilized for sequence modeling and RUL prediction of the processed data. Finally, accurate prediction of the RUL of the four battery cells is achieved through cross-validation and four sets of comparison experiments. Three evaluation metrics, MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, are selected, and the values of these metrics are 0.170, 0.202, and 19.611%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prediction models in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. This provides a new solution direction for the daily life prediction research of lithium-ion batteries.",
