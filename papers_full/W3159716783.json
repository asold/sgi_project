INTRODUCTION\nPower transformer is an essential component in the electric-\nity grids. While transformer is designed to withstand harsh\nmechanical and electrical stresses, natural aging, deteriora-\ntion of solid insulation, severe short circuit faults, earth-\nquakes, and careless transportation may lead to winding and\ncore deformation. As such, several condition monitoring and\nfault diagnostic techniques have been developed over the\nyears to maintain transformer reliability. For instance, insu-\nlating oil analysis can provide considerable information about\nthe health state of the transformer and its useful remaining\nlifetime [1]. Dynamic resistance measurement used to diag-\nnose the transformer tap changer [2]. Partial discharge mea-\nsurement is used to assess the condition of power transformer\nbushings and insulation systems [3], [4].\nCurrently, Frequency response analysis (FRA) is an ofﬂine\ntechnique using a well-developed frequency analyzer to eval-\nuate the mechanical integrity of power transformers [5]. The\nFRA technique can detect several mechanical core and wind-\ning deformations within power transformers. FRA technique\ncan also be used to detect the degradation of the dielectric\ninsulation system [6], [7]. Mechanical and electrical faults\nresult in changes in the winding resistance, inductance, and\ncapacitance, and hence the winding impedance or transfer\nfunction will be changed within a particular frequency range.\nThe FRA measurement is conducted ofﬂine without any\npower electronic interface and hence the issue of mirror\nfrequency discussed in [8] is insigniﬁcant. The presented\ndata include magnitude and phase spectrum. Results can be\nsaved as an excel ﬁle that captures complete data. In case of\nfailed measurement, it can be repeated on site in few minutes.\nHence lack of data as discussed in [9] is irrelevant to the FRA\ntechnique.\nFRA is a two-response graphical comparison technique in\nwhich the measured frequency response is compared with\nthe transformer ﬁngerprint. This comparison is usually con-\nducted visually or by using statistical indicators [10], [11].\nHowever, consistent interpretation of FRA signatures is still\nchallenging due to the lack of widely accepted FRA codes.\nThis is attributed to the fact that staging real faults on oper-\nating transformers to investigate their impacts on the FRA\nsignature is impractical. On the other hand, lack of resources\nhas limited research efforts on custom-made transformers that\ncan be used for experimental studies. Most research activities\nin this ﬁeld have been conducted using simulation analysis\non transformer models.\nFIGURE 1. 33/11 kV 30MVA measured transformer (a) Onsite sister\ntransformer (b) HV-LV windings, top view.\nFinite element methods (FEM) are used to mimic physical\nsystems like power transformers, but it calls for a high-speed\ncomputer. State-space or transfer function is a technique that\ncan model the transformer analytically based on a set of\nﬁrst-order differential equations [12]–[14]. Also, a lumped\nequivalent circuit can represent the transformer winding in\na high-frequency range [15], [16]. Relevant literature on\nunderstanding the effect of transformer FRA signature is\nsummarized in Table 1.\nThe above discussion reveals that, there is no single paper\ninvestigated all kinds of faults through comprehensive exper-\nimental, modelling and analytical approaches. This paper is\naimed to explore the impact of several faults on the trans-\nformer FRA signature through comprehensive simulation and\nexperimental analyses. In this regard, six common trans-\nformer faults including inter-disk fault, axial displacement,\nradial deformation, bushing fault, loss of clamping pressure,\nand short circuit fault are investigated. The FRA signature\nfor each fault is obtained and analyzed using four statistical\nindicators. The study is performed on real 33/11 kV , 30 MV A\ntransformer data. MATLAB Simulink is used to simulate\nthe circuit model corresponding to each fault. Results are\nanalyzed using various numerical indices such as, correlation\ncoefﬁcient (CC), Absolute sum of logarithmic error (ASLE),\nstandard deviation (SD), and sum square error (SSE).\nII. MODEL DEVELOPMENT\nExperimental and simulation analyses are conducted on a\n33/11 kV , 30 MV A transformer shown in Figure 1. The\ngeometrical dimensions are used to identify the transformer\nequivalent circuit parameters based on the procedure shown\nin Figure 2. The simulation model is ﬁrstly validated by\ncomparing the simulation and measured FRA signatures of\nthe investigated transformer. After that, different faults of\nvarious levels are simulated by changing equivalent circuit\nparameters, as will be elaborated below.\nA.

Transformer winding geometry.\nB. CALCULATION OF CIRCUIT PARAMETERS\nTransformer modeling for frequency response analysis stud-\nies calls for calculating the total series capacitance Cs,\nthe capacitance between turns Ct and discs Cd , winding series\nresistance Rs, capacitance to the ground Cg, conductance Gs,\nand self and a matrix Mkm representing the self (main diagonal\nelements) and mutual inductance (off-diagonal elements).\n1) SERIES CAPACITANCE\nThe capacitances between turns, Ct , and discs Cd are shown\nin Figure 6. The transformer capacitance equivalent circuit is\nshown in Figure 7, which can be calculated using (1). The\ncapacitance between adjacent discs is shown in Figure 6b.\nIt can be calculated using (2) in which d is the distance\nbetween turns (accounting for the fringing effect) and di and\ndo are the winding’s inner and outer diameters, respectively.\nCt =2πεr εoL\nlnb\na\n(1)\nCd =εr εoπ×d′2\no −d′2\ni\n4 ×d (2)\nwhere the permittivity ε =εr εo,d′\no =do +d,d′\ni =di −d,\nL is the conductor length, and a and b are the conductors’\ninner and outer radii. εo is the permittivity of the free space,\n8.854 ×10−12 F/m, εr is the relative permittivity of the\ninsulation paper, which is 3.85.\nThe total capacitance between turns is calculated by (3),\nand the total capacitance between discs is given by (4).\nFIGURE 6. (a) Conductor diagram with few turns (b) Two discs with, A\ndiameter separated by d distance.\nFIGURE 7. Equivalent capacitance network of the transformer winding.\nTherefore, the entire series capacitance of the winding can\nbe calculated using (5), [26], [27].\nCt total = 1\n1\nCt1 + 1\nCt2 + 1\nCtn\n(3)\nCdtotal =Cd1 +Cd2 +Cdn (4)\nCs = 1\nNd\n(Ct\nmt +4Cdt\n)\n,Cdt =(mt −1)(2mt −1)\n6mt C\nd\n(5)\nwhere Cdt is the resultant inter-disc capacitance. There is also\ncapacitance to the ground, Cg that can be calculated using the\nfollowing formula [26].\nCg =(2πεr ε0h,)/ln(di/do) (6)\n2) SERIES RESISTANCE\nFirst, the total circumference of the winding conductor Cir\nis given by Cir = 2πr. Then the series resistance can be\ncalculated by using (8) [26].\nRs =Rs1 ×Cir (7)\nRs = 1\n2(h +w)\n√\nπf µ\nσ /m (8)\nwhere h, w, are the height and width of the conductor, respec-\ntively.f is the signal frequency, µand σ are the permeability\nand conductivity of the conductor, respectively. On the other\nhand, the conductance G can be obtained from (9), where tanδ\nis the insulation dissipation factor [26].\nG =2πfCs tanδ (9)\n70938 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. M. A. N. Al-Ameriet al.: Understanding Influence of Power Transformer Faults on Frequency Response Signature\nFIGURE 8. The general dimensions of the winding discs [28].\n3) SELF AND MUTUAL INDUCTANCES\nThe self and mutual inductances can be calculated using a\nmatrix generated by (10), (11) [28].\nMkm =µoNk Nm\n√\n(rα)2\nk\n[(\n1 −k2\n2\n)\nK (k)−E (k)\n]\n(10)\nK =\n√\n4αr\nz2 +(α+r)2 (11)\nMkm represents the mutual inductance between discs k and\nm, r is the average radius of the discs, and z is the axial\ndistance between the two discs. Nk and Nm are the numbers of\nturns in the kth and mth sections, as shown in Figure 8. K and\nE are the elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst and second kinds. For\nself-inductance when k =m, z is calculated by z =0.2235\n×(h+w). Also, h1 and w1 are like h2 and w2. The diagonal\nelements of the obtained matrix represent the self-inductance,\nwhile the off-diagonal elements are the mutual inductance\nbetween discs. In this study, the value of r and αare assumed\nto be equal because the average radius of the sections is the\nsame. The value of the magnetic permeability of the medium\nis µ0=4π×10−7 H/m. The self and mutual inductance uses\nthe same equation because they are of the same concept. The\nself-inductance is for the turns in the same phase, whereas the\nmutual inductance is the inductance between the HV and LV\nwindings.\nC. EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODEL\nThe equivalent circuit of a single disc comprising the above\nparameters is shown in Figure 9 with a full circuit model as\nshown in Figure 10.\nThe sensitivity of the FRA signature due to various faults\nand variations of the model parameters is investigated below.\nIn all simulations, a sinusoidal excitation voltage of a 10 V\npeak amplitude and sweep frequency range (10Hz to 2MHz)\nis used as a source to plot the winding FRA signatures [20].\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nThe calculated parameters of the equivalent circuit shown\nin Figure 10 are listed in Table 3.\nFIGURE 9. Single-disc transformer winding components.\nFIGURE 10. Transformer winding electrical circuit model.\nThe measured response is obtained for phase-A of a\n33/11 kV , 30 MV A transformer using end−to −end open cir-\ncuit conﬁguration. The measurement is conducted by inject-\ning the excitation signal at one terminal of phase-A of the\nHV winding and measuring the response at the other terminal\nwhile the LV windings are left open circuit.\nThe measured and simulated FRA signatures for the inves-\ntigated transformer (phase-A) with no faults are shown\nin Figure 11. While there is an apparent difference between\nthe two signatures, the two responses show similar trends in\nterms of negative and positive slopes along with a reasonable\nagreement of the resonance and anti-resonance points. It is\nto be noted that FRA is a comparative analysis technique in\nwhich correct conclusions can be reported as long as mea-\nVOLUME 9, 2021 70939\nS. M. A. N.

Thus, using the simulation response shown\nin Figure 11 as a model ﬁngerprint in the below investigation\nis reasonable.\nA. MODEL SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS\nThis analysis is performed by changing the winding RLC\nvalues and investigating the impact of this change on the\nFRA signature. This helps understand the effect of parameters\nvariations due to various faults, as shown in Table 4, on the\nFRA signature.\nThe series resistance Rshv and Rslv are increased by 50% to\ninvestigate its impact on the FRA signature, as shown in Fig-\nure 12. Resistance increase can be due to tap changer dam-\nages [30]. Results show that increasing the winding resistance\naffects the response over the entire frequency range (20 Hz to\n2 MHz). The response magnitude decreases at 80 kHz from\n−76 dB to −84 dB and at 180 kHz from −82 dB to −92 dB.\nOn the other hand, the response is shifting towards lower fre-\nquencies at frequencies above 100 kHz. The anti-resonance\nfrequency at 180 kHz is shifted to 130 kHz. It can be\nconcluded that increasing winding resistance decreases the\nFIGURE 12. Effect of increasing resistance on the FRA signature.\nTABLE 4. Transformer faults and winding parameters [20], [29].\nresponse magnitude and shifts the resonant points towards\nlower frequencies.\nBy increasing the self-inductance Lshv and Lslv by 50%,\nthe obtained FRA signature compared to the ﬁngerprint is\nas shown in Figure 13. The increase in winding inductance\ncauses a signiﬁcant deviation in the low-frequency range\nat which inductive components dominate the response. The\nanti-resonance frequency at 180 kHz is shifted to 125 kHz\nwith a slight change in the magnitude. Such changes in the\ninductance may be due to short circuit faults or core defor-\nmation.\nWhen the winding series capacitance Cshv and Cslv is\nincreased by 50%, the FRA signature shown in Fig-\nure 14 is obtained. This change causes the response to shift\ntowards lower frequencies with a reduction in the magnitude.\nAt 180 kHz, the anti-resonance frequency moves to 152 kHz.\nOn the other hand, the magnitude at the resonance frequency\n250 kHz is reduced from −58 dB to −64 dB. The increase in\nthe series capacitance is mainly due to transformer insulation\naging as shown in Table 4.\nB. FAULTS SIMULATION\nIn this section, various faults are simulated on the transformer\nmodel shown in Figure 10 by changing particular circuit\nparameters. The effect of each fault on the transformer FRA\nsignature is then investigated.\n1) INTER-DISC FAULT\nThe inter-disc fault occurs due to considerable mechanical\nstress on the discs, which causes variation in the axial disc\n70940 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS. M. A. N. Al-Ameriet al.: Understanding Influence of Power Transformer Faults on Frequency Response Signature\nFIGURE 13. Effect of increasing inductance on the FRA signature.\nFIGURE 14. Effect of increasing capacitance on the FRA signature.\nFIGURE 15. Effect of inter-disc fault on the FRA signature.\nspacing. As a result of the inter-disc fault, the total number\nof operating discs is reduced. Accordingly, the inter-disc\nfault can be simulated by reducing the number of discs\n(10% reduction is assumed in this case study). FRA results\nshown in Figure 15 reveal no signiﬁcant changes of the\nresultant FRA signature from the ﬁngerprint in the fre-\nquency range below 2 kHz. The response between 2 kHz\nand 70 kHz is slightly shifted towards higher frequencies.\nThe peak magnitude also increases in the high-frequency\nregion.\n2) AXIAL DISPLACEMENT FAULT\nThe change 1h shown in Figure 16 represents the\naxial displacement that occurs due to the action of\ntwo unequal axial electromagnetic force components on\nFIGURE 16. Winding axial displacement configuration.\nFIGURE 17. Winding axial displacement lumped circuit.\nthe LV winding. According to [20], axial displacement\ncan be simulated by changing the capacitance value\nbetween the HV and LV windings CHL and the mutual\ninductance Mkm.\nThis fault is simulated by increasing C HL by 10% while\nreducing Mkm by10%. Figure 17 shows the circuit model with\nLV winding exhibiting downward axial displacement fault.\nFigure 18 shows the impact of this fault on the FRA signature\nof which a small effect can be observed in the high-frequency\nregion. At this range, the magnitude increases from −78 dB\nto −76 dB at 80 kHz.\n3) RADIAL FAULT\nRadial fault, also called radial buckling, is resulted due to\ngenerated electromagnetic force from the circumferential\nwinding currents. Figure 19 shows the HV winding radial\nVOLUME 9, 2021 70941\nS. M. A. N. Al-Ameriet al.: Understanding Influence of Power Transformer Faults on Frequency Response Signature\nFIGURE 18.

Effect of radial fault on transformer FRA signature.\nfault conﬁguration, which changes the width 1w. Accord-\ning to [29], [31], a minor radial winding fault can be sim-\nulated by decreasing the ground capacitance Cg by 10%.\nThe capacitance CHL and mutual inductance Mkm between\nthe HV and LV windings will also be decreased due to\nthe fault. As such, this fault is simulated by reducing the\nHV winding ground capacitance Chg, CHL, and Mkm by\n10% each.\nThe FRA signature shown in Figure 20 reveals that radial\nfault alters the FRA signature in the mid-and high-frequency\nranges. It can be observed that, at 80 kHz, the magnitude\nincreases from −78 dB to −74 dB. The magnitude also\nincreases at all resonance and anti-resonance frequencies in\nthe high-frequency region.\nFIGURE 21. Laboratory capacitance measurement for equivalent 33/11kV\ntransformer HV-winding bushing.\nFIGURE 22. Transformer HV-winding bushing circuit model.\nFIGURE 23. Effect of bushing fault on the FRA signature.\n4) HV-WINDING BUSHING FAULT\nAn additional T-circuit is modeled and connected to the\nproposed transformer equivalent circuit to model the HV\nwinding bushing [20]. The capacitances of this T-circuit are\nmeasured for an equivalent transformer in the laboratory\nusing the setup shown in Figure 21. The equivalent circuit\nis shown in Figure 22.\nBushing fault is simulated by a 50% reduction in the\nbushing capacitance, i.e., from 29.43 pF to 14.72 pF.\nFigure 23 shows that the magnitude of the FRA signature\nincreases in the high-frequency range above 200 kHz due to\nbushing fault.\n70942 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS.

Electrical circuit model with shorted turns.\n5) LOSS OF CLAMPING PRESSURE\nLoss of clamping pressure is a common problem in old\ntransformers due to the severe degradation of the solid\ninsulation mechanical strength. This fault can be simu-\nlated by increasing the value of the shunt conductance\nGsh [20]. Hence, this fault is simulated by increasing the shunt\nconductance G sh−HV ,GHL , andG sh−LV by 50%. Figure 24\nshows this fault affects the magnitude of the FRA signa-\nture with no obvious effect on the location of the resonance\nfrequencies.\nFIGURE 26. Effect of short circuit fault on the FRA signature.\nFIGURE 27. Correlation coefficient for various transformer faults within\nthree sub-frequency ranges.\n6) SHORT CIRCUIT FAULT\nA short circuit fault occurs due to damages in the winding\ninsulation, which causes a reduction in the total number of\nwinding turns. According to [32], a short circuit resistance,\nRe of 0.0001, is connected in parallel with the certain\nnumber of turns to simulate this fault as shown in Figure 25.\nIn this case, 10% of the HV winding turns is assumed to be\nshorted. Figure 26 indicates that the magnitude of the FRA\nresponse between 20 Hz and 2 kHz is slightly increased due\nto this fault. The resonance and anti-resonance frequencies\nbetween 40 kHz and 160 kHz are also affected.\nC. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nThere are various statistical indicators used to analyze the\nFRA results [33], [34]. The IEEE standard [35] recommended\nusing the correlation coefﬁcient (CC) for FRA interpretation.\nIn this paper, statistical indices such as the absolute sum of\nlogarithmic error (ASLE), standard deviation (SD), and sum\nsquared error (SSE) are also utilized. ASLE, SD, and SSE\ncould be more sensitive than CC to detect minor changes\nin the FRA signature. According to [36], the criteria for\ndiagnosing winding displacement are below 0.9998 for the\nCC, above 0.4 for the ASLE, and above 1.0 for the SD.\nThree frequency sub-bands are considered in this paper’s\nanalysis because various faults affect the FRA signature\nwithin these frequency ranges. Considered frequency ranges\nare: low-frequency region (100 Hz < LF < 2 kHz),\nVOLUME 9, 2021 70943\nS. M. A. N. Al-Ameriet al.: Understanding Influence of Power Transformer Faults on Frequency Response Signature\nFIGURE 28. Absolute sum logarithmic error for various transformer faults\nwithin three sub-frequency ranges.\nmid-frequency region (2 kHz < MF < 20 kHz) and the\nhigh-frequency region (HF > 20 kHz). These are the fre-\nquency ranges where the investigated faults have consider-\nable effect on the FRA signature. The difference between the\nnormal and faulty responses is calculated at 326 points at the\nLF range, 251 points at the MF range and 424 points at the HF\nrange. These statistical indicators are listed in Table 5 and\nexplained below.\n1) CORRELATION COEFFICIENT\nCC calculates the variation between two FRA traces X(i)\nand Y(i), as given by (12). If the two responses are identical,\nthe result is 1; otherwise, it ranges between 0 and 1 based\non the two signals’ correlation level. However, CC is the\ncovariance normalization; so, it is not sensitive to identify\nconstant changes between two frequency responses [33].\nCC(X,Y ) =\n∑N\ni=1 X (i)×Y (i)\n√∑N\ni=1 [X (i)]2 ×∑N\ni=1 [Y (i)]2\n(12)\nTable 5 shows an agreement between normal and faulty\nresponses at low and mid-frequency regions. The values\nof the CC are above 0.99 within these ranges for all fault\ntypes. However, the CC detects the variation with values\nat the high-frequency region between 0.99 and 0.98. Fig-\nure 27 shows an agreement between the responses at the\nlow-frequency and mid-frequency regions and division at the\nhigh-frequency region. Therefore CC is sensitive to changes\nin the high-frequency range. Compared to ASLE, SD, and\nSSE, the CC is not highly recommended.\n2) ABSOLUTE SUM LOGARITHMIC ERROR\nASLE is highly recommended in the latest studies as it\nis reported to be more pertinent than the CC and SSE\nfor detecting the variation between transformer FRA signa-\ntures [33], [37]. It can be calculated from:\nASLE(X,Y ) =\n∑N\ni=1\n⏐⏐20log10Yi −20log10Xi\n⏐\n⏐\nN (13)\nTable 5 shows that ASLE can detect the effect of inter-\ndisc fault, loss of clamping pressure, and short circuit fault\nFIGURE 29. Standard deviation for various transformer faults within\nthree sub-frequency ranges.\nover the entire frequency range, as the value of ASLE is\nmore than 0.53 for these faults. It also detects the variation\nat high frequency range for the other investigated faults.\nFigure 28 shows the sensitivity of this indicator to various\nfaults. As can be observed, ASLE cannot detect winding\naxial displacement, radial deformation, and bushing fault\nin the low-frequency and mid-frequency regions. However,\nit clearly shows the effect of these faults at the high-frequency\nregion. According to these results, ASLE is a very sensitive\nstatistical indicator to the variation of the frequency responses\nthat have a linear correlation.\n3) STANDARD DEVIATION\nPrevious studies reported that SD can detect changes of two\nFRA signatures [24]. SD is calculated using (14).\nSD(X,Y ) =\n√\n∑N\ni=1 [Y (i)−X (i)]2\nN −1 (14)\nTypically, SD shows a similar trend as ASLE as can be\nnoticed in Table 5 and Figure 29. For the loss of clamping\npressure, ASLE shows more variation in the low-frequency\nregion than the high-frequency region, but SD shows a similar\nvariation level at both regions. The SD in short circuit fault\nindicates an increment in the deviation at the low-frequency,\nmid-frequency, and high-frequency regions. However, this\nincrement is slightly shown by using the ASLE. Hence,\nthe SD can also be highly recommended for the interpretation\nof the FRA signatures.\n4) SUM SQUARE ERROR\nThe SSE is sensitive to considerable variation and is not\nsensitive to differences less than one. It can be calculated\nfrom:\nSSE =\n∑N\ni=1 (Y (i)−X (i))2\nN (15)\nSSE sensitivity to detect faults such as inter-disc fault\nand short circuit faults is shown in Figure 30 which reveals\nthat SSE can detect the deviation between normal and faulty\nsignatures.\n70944 VOLUME 9, 2021\nS.

Comparison of statistical indicators in detecting FRA variation between normal and faulty responses.\nTABLE 6. Summary of the effects of faults on the transformer FRA signature.\nFIGURE 30. Sum square error for various transformer faults within three\nsub-frequency ranges.\n5) DISCUSSIONS\nA summary of the effect of each examined fault on the FRA\nsignature is shown in Table 6. This table is created to list the\neffect of various transformer faults on the FRA signature. The\ntable can be used to initiate appropriate standards for power\ntransformer FRA signature interpretation. Table 6 shows that\nthe inter-disc fault that is simulated by a 10% reduction in\nthe number of discs, has no effect on the frequency response\nat the LF region while it affects the signature at the MF and\nthe HF regions. The axial winding displacement which is\nsimulated by a 10% increment in the capacitance Csh, and\nthe mutual inductance Mkm, has no effect on the signature\nwithin the LF and MF regions while it affects the signature in\nthe HF region. The radial fault is simulated by reducing the\ncapacitance to ground. Results show that radial fault affects\nthe FRA signature at the HF region through an increase in\nthe magnitude. Bushing fault is simulated by reducing the\nbushing capacitance by 50%, and the results show its impact\nin the HF region, as summarized in Table 6. The losses of\nwinding clamping shows an effect on the entire frequency\nrange. The short circuit fault affects the FRA signature within\nthe MF and HF regions.\nEventually, this study proposed a simpliﬁed transformer\nmodel and simulated several faults that can be detected\nusing the FRA technique. The motivation behind using this\nmethodology is the difﬁculty of applying various destructive\nmechanical faults to the power transformers to study their\nimpacts on the FRA signature. Comparison of the FRA sig-\nnatures obtained using the simulation model and the prac-\ntical measurement indicates the robustness of the proposed\nsimulation model. Obtained results for axial displacement\nagree well with the results published in [21]. There is also\na good agreement with the measurement results published\nin [22], [38]. Analytical results show that statistical indicators\nare not consistent in revealing all types of faults.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nThis paper is aimed to provide a better understanding to the\nFRA signatures using simulation and statistical indicators.\nA 33/11 kV 30 MV A transformer circuit model is proposed\nto study the impact of various faults on the FRA signature.\nThe model parameters such as series resistance Rs, series\ncapacitance Cs, and mutual inductance Mkm are calculated\nusing complex equations based on the transformer physical\ndimensions. The model sensitivity analysis shows that the\nsimulated FRA signature is sensitive to the variations in the\ncircuit parameters, which gives more conﬁdence in using the\nVOLUME 9, 2021 70945\nS. M. A. N. Al-Ameriet al.: Understanding Influence of Power Transformer Faults on Frequency Response Signature\nsimulation model to mimic real faults. Results show that the\ninter-disk fault affects the FRA response at the mid- and high-\nfrequency regions. Axial winding displacement shows an\nimpact on the high-frequency region, which is similar to the\neffect of radial deformation and winding bushing fault. The\nloss of clamping pressure shows an effect over the entire fre-\nquency range. The impact of short circuit fault is noticeable\nat the mid-and high-frequency regions. Statistical indicators,\nCC, ASLE, SD, and SSE, are sensitive to the variations in\nthe FRA signature. Results show that the ASLE has a good\nperformance in detecting small variations. However, there is\nno one single indicator that can detect all fault types. Results\nrecommend the use of all investigated indicators in three-\nsub-frequency ranges.\nREFERENCES\n[1] G.
