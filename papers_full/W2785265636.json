  "full_text": "Assessment of the Effects of Economic Sanctions on \nIranians’ Right to Health by Using Human Rights Impact \nAssessment Tool: A Systematic Review\nFatemeh Kokabisaghi1,2*\nAbstract\nBackground: Over the years, economic sanctions have contributed to violation of right to health in target countries. \nIran has been under comprehensive unilateral economic sanctions by groups of countries (not United Nations [UN]) \nin recent years. They have been intensified from 2012 because of international community’s uncertainty about peaceful \npurpose of Iran’s nuclear program and inadequacy of trust-building actions of this country. This review aimed to identify \nthe humanitarian effects of the sanctions on the right of Iranians to health and the obligations of Iran and international \ncommunity about it. \nMethods: To assess economic sanction policies and identify violated rights and the obligations of states according to \ninternational human rights laws, in this study, Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIA) tool is used. Applying this \ntool requires collection of evidences regarding the situation of rights. To provide such evidence, a systematic review of \nliterature which involved 55 papers retrieved from the web-based databases and official webpages of Iran’s government \nand UN’ health and human rights committees and organizations was done. All articles about the consequences of \neconomic sanctions related to nuclear activities of Iran on welfare and health of Iranians published from January 2012 till \nFebruary 2017 in English and Persian languages were included. Search terms were economic sanctions, embargoes, Iran, \nwelfare, health and medicine. Additional studies were identified by cross checking the reference lists of accessed articles. \nAll selected papers were abstracted and entered into a matrix describing study design and findings, and categorized into \na framework of themes reflecting the areas covered (health and its determinants). According to HRIA framework, related \nobligations of Iran and other states about adverse effects of the sanctions on Iranians’ right to health were extracted.\nResults: The sanctions on Iran caused a fall of country’s revenues, devaluation of national currency, and increase of \ninflation and unemployment. These all resulted in deterioration of people’s overall welfare and lowering their ability to \naccess the necessities of a standard life such as nutritious food, healthcare and medicine. Also, the sanctions on banking, \nfinancial system and shipment led to scarcity of quality lifesaving medicines. The impacts of sanctions were more immense \non the lives of the poor, patients, women and children. Humanitarian exemptions did not protect Iranians from the adverse \neffects of sanctions. \nConclusion: Countries which imposed economic sanctions against Iran have violated Iranians’ right to health. \nInternational community should have predicted any probable humanitarian effects of sanctions and used any necessary \nmeans to prevent it. Furthermore, Iran should have used any essential means to protect people from the adverse effects of \nsanctions. Now, they should work on alleviation of the negative effects of sanctions. Even though, some of the effects such \nas disability and death cannot be compensated. In future, before imposition of sanctions, decisions makers should advice \nan international order to prevent such impacts on targeted countries’ populations. \nKeywords: Economic Sanctions, Right to Medicine, Human Rights, Iran, HRIA Tool\nCopyright: © 2018 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

However, multiple \nstudies on Iraq, the former Yugoslavia, Nicaragua, Burundi, \nCuba, and Haiti showed that due to their long term impacts \non the lives and health of a large population, the adverse \nhumanitarian effects of economic sanctions are comparable \nto, if not more immense than wars. 2-7 Through exacerbating \neconomic situation and functions of social systems of a target \ncountry, they decrease the access of people to necessities of life \nsuch as nutritious food and medical care. 3-5,7 From practical \npoint of view, there is no difference between dying due to \nbeing shot or being deprived from life-saving medicines. \nIslamic Republic of Iran (hereafter; Iran) has been under \neconomic sanctions for more than three decades. In this \nstudy, the effects of the sanctions on Iranians’ right to health, \nas well as international human rights obligations of Iran and \nKokabisaghi\nInternational Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2018, 7(5), 374–393 375\ninternational community regarding this issue are scrutinized.\nRight to Health \nAccording to the UN Declaration of Human Rights 1948, \neveryone has a right to a standard of living adequate for \nhis health and well-being including food, medical care and \nsocial security without any kinds of discrimination on any \ngrounds such as gender, race and the political, jurisdictional \nor international status of the place to which a person belongs.8 \nRight to health has been reflected in several international \nhuman rights treaties such as International Covenant on \nEconomic social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) Article 12. \nThis right is a right to “the highest attainable standard of \nphysical and mental health” (hereafter; right to health) based \non ICESCR.9 Achievement of this level of health is one of the \nmost important universal social goals. In the Constitution \nof World Heath Organization (WHO), health of all human \nbeings is defined as a necessary condition to the attainment \nof universal peace. 10\nAccording to ICESCR, the right to health includes a right \nto access timely and appropriate healthcare and underlying \ndeterminants of health, such as safe water, nutritious food, \nhousing, and healthy environment. All the facilities, services \nand goods related to health and its determinants should \nbe of good quality, acceptable, available and physically \nand financially accessible to all, without any kinds of \ndiscrimination. States are needed to provide health insurance \nand financial aids for the poor to enjoy this right. 11 The \nCommittee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ESCR) \nacknowledged resources limitations of states in realizing \nESCRs in a limited time. Therefore, it required the states to \nrealize minimum core obligations immediately after ratifying \nthe covenant and progressively realize these rights by taking \nsteps to pursue the goals of the Covenant and using the \nmaximum of available resources.9 The core obligations of the \nright to health includes access to health facilities, products \nand services and minimum essential food, basic shelter, \nsanitation and safe water.12 While recognizing the right of the \nstates (who lack recourses for provision of the minimum of \nrights) to international assistance, the Committee requires all \nthe states parties to realize right to health and contribute to \nthe improvement of international health. 9 \nEconomic Sanctions and Human Rights\nSanctions are “measures taken by a state to coerce another to \nconform to an international agreement or norms of conduct, \ntypically in the form of restrictions on trade. ”13 These measures \nare called countermeasures which are resorted against an \ninternational wrongdoer in the case that they are not decided \nby UN Security Council. 14 They may be comprehensive \nwhich prohibit commercial activities entirely with a country, \nor targeted (or smart) which block transactions of and with \ncertain businesses, groups, or individuals of a target country.15 \nAccording to the Articles 39-43 of the Charter of UN 1945, \nif the Security Council determines any threat to the peace, \nbreach of the peace, or act of aggression, it can decide what \nmeasures shall be taken to maintain or restore international \npeace and security. These measures may include use of arm \nforces, complete or partial interruption of economic relations \nand of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means \nof communication, and the severance of diplomatic relations. \nAll members of the UN are required to collaborate on these \nissues with the Council. 16 \nIn 2003, because the International Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) was uncertain about the scope and nature of \nIran’s nuclear activities, it asked Iran to be transparent and \nbuild confidence and suspend all enrichment related and \nreprocessing activities including research and development. \nIn 2006, IAEA declared that it is “unable to make progress \nin its efforts to provide assurances about the absence \nof undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. ” 17 \nTherefore, the case of Iran was brought to UN Security \nCouncil. At first, Iran was needed to “build the confidence \nregarding to peaceful purpose of its nuclear program and to \nsuspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, \nincluding research and development. ” However, Iran’s trust \nbuilding attempts were not adequate according to the UN \nSecurity Council. In 2007, Iran confronted with the Council’s \nsanction resolution related to its nuclear activities. 18 All the \nsanctions defined by Security Council against Iran have been \nabout limitation on its nuclear and military industry. No \neconomic sanctions against this country were initiated by the \nCouncil.19 However, some countries decided to use “coercive \ndiplomacy” and unilaterally boycott Iran with economic \nsanctions in 2012. About the measures are to be taken by \nthe member states of UN in order to maintain international \npeace and security, the Charter of UN clearly states that “the \nmeasures shall be concluded between the Security Council \nand Members or between the Security Council and groups of \nMembers and shall be subject to ratification by the signatory \nstates in accordance with their respective constitutional \nprocesses. ”16 General comment no. 8 of ICESCRs about The \nrelationship between economic sanctions and respect for \neconomic, social and cultural rights indicates that: \nWhatever the circumstances, such sanctions should always \ntake full account of the provisions of the International \nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The \nCommittee does not in any way call into question the \nnecessity for the imposition of sanctions in appropriate \ncases in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter of \nthe UN or other applicable international law. But those \nprovisions of the Charter that relate to human rights \n(Articles 1, 55 and 56) must still be considered to be fully \napplicable in such cases. 20\nSanctions are called “brutal instruments” by the UN Food \nProgram; WHO has asked international community to ban \nthem altogether.21 The Committee on the Rights of the Child \nalso declared that economic sanctions can act as an obstacle \nto the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the \nChild (CRC). 22 Through humanitarian exemptions for food \nand medicine, the sanctions often do not aim to violate people’s \nright to health in target countries. But, still civilians of target \ncountries suffer from deprivation; since, it is not possible to \nseparate effects of economic sanctions on health and economy. \nUN Human Rights Council in 2013 declared that there are \nreliable evidences about serious consequences of sanctions \nKokabisaghi\nInternational Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2018, 7(5), 374–393376\non the rights of people particularly vulnerable groups such as \nwomen, children, the elderly, the poor, minorities, indigenous \npeople and persons living with disabilities. 23 \nEconomic sanctions on countries such as Iraq, the former \nYugoslavia, Nicaragua, Burundi, Cuba, and Haiti were \nassociated with the deterioration of health and welfare of \nthe population.3,4,7 In sanctions period, decline of revenues, \nincrease of poverty, unemployment, and inflation, as well as \ndeterioration of health services’ functions, school attainment \nand society’s development were reported. Also, the sanctions \nhave made essential goods more costly and difficult to \nproduce and maintain. 3 In these situations, people’s ability \nto afford health services and maintain a healthy life style has \nbeen reduced. 5 Rise of maternal, infant and child mortality \nrates has been considerable during sanctions period in some \ncountries under sanctions. In addition, poor nutrition and \nlack of access to health services and medical supplies brought \nsevere public health problems such as epidemics of diseases \nparticularly among the poorest groups of the society. 24 \nFurthermore, shortage of medicines and medical equipment \ndeteriorated the practices of health systems. For instance, in \nSyria, sanctions brought difficulty in the import of essential \nmedicines which were not produced locally. 25 Cuba also \nlost access to raw materials needed for manufacturing \npharmaceuticals and lacked the currency to purchase \nmedicines and medical equipment from international market \nin sanctions period. 6 Moreover, sanctions on import of non-\nmedical products and spare parts, and trade restriction on \nwater and electrical supply systems affected effectiveness of \nhealth systems in Cuba, Iraq, and Haiti; trade embargoes on \nagricultural sector such as fertilizers and seeds caused food \nshortage.5 In another case, reduction of revenues of target \ncountries has decreased governments’ ability to finance \nhealthcare system or sanctions on opening LC (letter of credit) \nfor Iranian banks and shipment of imported goods caused \nshortage of medicines in Iran. Therefore, to ensure access of \npeople to food and healthcare, humanitarian exemptions and \nproviding supplementary aid are not adequate. \nSanctions Against Iran\nPoverty alleviation and social and health equity are prioritized \nin the Constitution and development plans of Iran. After \nthe Revolution 1979, a welfare state system which focuses \non health, education and social aid has been established in \nIran. As results of a vast system of subsidies, material poverty \nhas fallen significantly in this country. By improving urban \ninfrastructures such as providing electricity, safe water and \nsanitation and universal free education, Iran has improved \nthe living conditions of Iranians to a great extent. In 2011, \nmore than 95% of Iranians had access to improved drinking \nwater sources and sanitation facilities. Total adult literacy rate \nwas 85% in this year.26 Also, for many years, Iran’s government \nprovided subsidized essential food stuffs such as flour, rice, \ncooking oil, sugar and milk to all the population. In 2010, this \ncountry changed this policy to cash payment to everyone. \nMoreover, through establishing successful primary healthcare \nnetwork around the country, health outcomes of the country \nhave improved notably over recent decades. Life expectancy \nof Iranians increased from 63 to 73.3 during 1990-2012 \nand the rates of maternal, prenatal and child mortality have \nfallen considerably. Maternal mortality per 100 000 live birth \ndecreased from 91 to 24.6 and infant mortality per 1000 live \nbirth decreased from 44 to 15 in this period. Communicable \ndiseases are controlled and are no longer the cause of \nmortality. Together, they cause less than 5% of deaths.26,27 UN \nChildren Found (UNICEF) declared in 2011 that through a \nstrong health and education network and infrastructure, Iran \nis on track to achieve most of the Millennium Development \nGoals’ targets including addressing poverty and hunger, \nprimary education, child mortality and maternal health .28 \nHowever, regarding the reduction of poverty the country is \nfacing major challenges such as increase of people in need \nof support because of conditions including inflation and \nunemployment. 27\nIn recent decades, people of Iran, having an oil-dependent \neconomy and inefficient industry continuously faced \nnumerous challenges including the effects of Revolution 1979, \neight-year-war with Iraq and several kinds of international \nsanctions from agriculture to the airline Industry. After \nthe Revolution, the sanctions were mainly imposed by the \nUnited States. However,their effects were limited, since Iran \ncould find ways to compensate for the loss partly through \nother countries or by some mediators despite these involving \nhigher expenses. Sanctions imposed by UN Security Council \nwhich aimed at forceing Iran to stop its nuclear activates \ntargeted the military and nuclear industry of Iran. However, \nwithout mandate of the UN, the United States, the European \nUnion ( EU) and some other countries decided to impose \ncomprehensive multilateral restrictions on any cooperation \nwith Iran in foreign trade. Embargos from the United \nStates also included “secondary sanctions” on countries and \ncompanies doing business with Iran. 29,30\nWhen sanctions (imposed without the mandate of UN) were \nintensified in 2012 to target all sectors of Iran’s economy, the \ncountry’s ability to sell oil became limited. As an oil-dependent \ncountry, Iran’s revenues and financial ability to purchase \nneeded supplies in the world market decreased considerably. It \nbecame worse after the freezing of properties of Iran’s Central \nBank and other financial institutions in third countries. Sharp \ndeclines in oil revenues and industrial production, severe \nrestrictions on the import of items, shipment and payment \nchannels, and considerable devaluation of the national \ncurrency (the Riyal), caused high rate of inflation in every \nsectors of Iran’s economy.31 Also, Iran had to accept payment \nin gold, local currencies and bartered goods from a few Asian \ncountries that still bought Iran’s oil. Therefore, Iran’s access \nto the US dollar and the euro needed for import from most \nof countries became limited. Furthermore, sanctions cut off \nIranian banks from global financial system; international \nbanks which dealt with Iran faced severe restrictions by \ninternational community.32 It made the transferring of oil’s \nearning back to the country extremely difficult. As a result, \nIran had to process the transactions by intermediary banks \nthat was very difficult and expensive. 31 These all diminished \nIran’s industry and economy and deteriorated Iranians’ \nwelfare to a great degree. Gross domestic product (GDP) \nKokabisaghi\nInternational Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2018, 7(5), 374–393 377\nper capita decreased by 35% during 2012 -2014 ( Figure 1).33 \nThe consumer price index increased from 100 to 178 (Figure \n2) and the inflation rate from 20 to 38% during 2011-2013 \n(Figure 3 ). GDP per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) \ndecreased by more than 10% from 2011 till 2013 (Figure 4).34 \nMinimum wage decreased from US$275.4 in 2010 to US$155 \nin 2012 (Table 1).35 While the unemployment rate was 11.3 in \n2016. This indicator was 10.5 in 2008. 36\nIn this article, after introducing the methods of study for \nassessing the humanitarian effects of sanctions and identifying \nmaterials that form the basis of the analysis, the adverse \neffects of economic sanctions on Iran’s economy, living \nconditions of Iranians and situation of right to health and \nmedicine are reviewed. Next, the actions and legal obligations \nof Iran’s government and of the international community in \nthe process of sanctions’ management are analyzed. Finally, \nsome recommendations for future sanction regimes, in order \nto better respond to humanitarian effects of the sanctions are \nprovided. \nMethods\nIn this study, to assess the adverse effects of economic \nsanctions on people’s right to health and identify the related \nnational and international obligations related to this violation, \nHuman Rights Impact Assessments (HRIA) tool is used. To \ntackle with the adverse impacts of trade agreements on the \nright to health, policy-makers employed various impact \nassessment tools such as Sustainability Impact Assessment \nof EU Trade Agreements. However, traditionally these tools \nfocus on economic and environmental and not social effects. \nHRIA is preferred because it uses a legally binding framework \nof International human rights law which is based on a strong \nnormative consensus and universally agreed principles. Also, \nit evaluates a full range of internationally agreed human \nrights, while focuses on empowerment and improvement. \nHRIAs tools emerged in the late 1990s for anticipating and \nmeasuring impacts of policies and programs on different \nhuman rights. They are helpful in identifying various types \nof duty- and right-bearers and their responsibilities. HRIAs \nhave been applied in a broad range of different fields such as \nin development (by the Norwegian Agency for Development \nCooperation and Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO]), \nHealth (by UN Special Rapporteur of Right to Health), trade \n(by UN Bodies and national Parliaments) and multinational \n39 \n \n \nChart no 1) Iran’s GDP per capita (US Dollar) during 2010-2014  \nRefernce: World Bank, available at http://data.worldbank.org/country/iran-islamic-rep?view=chart \n \nChart no 2) Consumer Price Index 2007-2013 Iran \nReference: Trading Economics, available at: https://tradingeconomics.com/iran/consumer-price-index-\ncpi/forecast \n \n5000\n5500\n6000\n6500\n7000\n7500\n8000\n8500\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\nUS Dollar\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013\nConsumer Price Index\nFigure 1.

HRIA identifies human rights violations which \ncan be challenged by judicial bodies and ignoring them might \ncause significant legal consequences for violating states and \ninstitutions. In this assessment, human rights obligations are \nextracted from main human rights laws such as Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights 1948, International Covenant \non Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) 1966, \nGeneral Comment no. 14 of ICESCR on right to health and \nGeneral Comment no. 8 ICESCR on the relationship between \nsanctions and right to health. HRIA includes 8 steps for \npolicy-makers and 6 steps (as below) for scholars:\n1)\t Screening: It requires selecting key human rights \nissues that are most likely to be affected. In this study, \nthe screening is done through analyzing the effects of \neconomic sanctions on Iran and other countries. \n2)\t Scoping: in this step, identifying the information needed \nand formulating concrete questions are necessary. \n3)\t Evidence Gathering: A quantitative as well as qualitative \nresearch techniques can be applied in this step. In this \nstudy, content analysis of relevant papers has been done.\n4)\t Consultation: interviewing affected populations and \nother potential right-holders or using secondary material, \nsuch as reports, studies and experiences which provide \nprimary data is necessary. In this study, a literature review \nabout the effects of the sanction policy on Iranians is \napplied. \n5)\t Analysis: in this step, deciding over the concrete human \nrights impact of the policy assessed by analyzing the \nresults of the literature review should be done. In the \ncase that sanctions affected availability, accessibility, \nacceptability and quality of health (and its determinants) \nservices, products and facilities, violation of the right to \nhealth has been occurred. \n6)\t Conclusions and Recommendations: in this step, \nidentifying specific duty-bearers and assigning them \nconcrete responsibilities should be done (Figure 5).\nTable 1.

A qualitative case study design involving \nstructured document review of relevant articles and policy \ndocuments were undertaken. Two sets of literature were \nstudied; the first set aimed to obtain papers focusing on \nthe situation of Iranians’ enjoyment of their right to health; \nwhile the second set aimed to understand legal human rights \nobligations of Iran and countries involved in implementing \nsanctions about Iranian’s right to health and a standard of life.\nSelection Criteria\nIn order to define keywords for search in databases, several \narticles about the subject were analyzed. Collected documents \nincluded original articles, reviews, editorials, letters to the \neditor, interviews, short reports and communications. The \npapers that described the effects of economic sanctions on \nIranian’s right to health published between January 2012 and \nFebruary 2017 were included. They were written in English \nand in the Persian languages. Articles related to sanction’s \neffects on other countries, sanctions which were not about \nFigure 5.

The papers related to justification of sanctions \nagainst Iran were included in the study if they discuss the \nhealth effects of sanctions. Moreover, papers about sanctions \nrelating to human right violations of the Iranian government \nwere not considered. \nData Extraction\nData about the situation of Iranian’s enjoyment of their right \nto health in sanction period were collected from web-based \ndatabases including EBESCO, PubMed, Web of Science, \nScopus, Emerald, Elsevier, Cochrane library, Hein online, J \nStore, Project Muse, Science Direct Springer, Wiley Online \nLibrary, Oxford Journals, Embase, SID, and Google Scholar \nby searching key words: “economic sanctions, ” “right to \nhealth, ” “embargoes, ” “medicine, ” and “Iran. ” More data was \nfound by cross checking the reference lists of accessed articles. \nFurthermore, official webpages of Iran’s government and UN’ \nhealth and human rights committees and organizations were \nstudied to find the results of economic sanctions against Iran \non people’s right to health. Selection of papers was exhaustive \nto locate every available one about the subject of the study. \nThe collected papers were analyzed in-depth in order to \ncollect evidences of humanitarian impacts of economic \nsanctions on Iranians’ lives and right to health. A total of \n87 documents including papers (n = 76), books (n = 5), and \nreports (n = 6) on the humanitarian effects of economic \nsanctions were identified. The abstracts were reviewed and \nduplicated articles, or those that were not pertinent to the \nstudy (because they were not about effects of sanctions on \nhealth and its determinants) or did not adequately address \nthe impacts of sanctions on Iranian’s livelihood (meaning that \nthey did not clarify how the right to health is influenced) were \nput aside. 55 documents emerged to be related to the topic \n(Figure 6). The other part of study is about the obligations \nof targeted and targeting states about right to health. For this \npart, electronic databases including UN Treaty Collections \nand UN official Document System were searched following \nthe terms “human rights, ” “right to health, ” “embargoes, ” \n“medicine, ” and “economic sanctions. ” The number of \nrelevant international laws that were identified was 13. All \nselected documents were summarized and categorized in two \nmain parts; effects of sanctions on Iranian’s right to health and \nthe obligations of Iran and international community about \nprotection of Iranians’ right to health.\nData Analysis\nData gathering and analysis were organized according to the \nHRIA tool. All selected papers were abstracted and entered \ninto a matrix describing study design and findings (see Table \n2). Findings were then categorized into a framework of themes \nreflecting the areas covered (health and its determinants). This \nprovide the structure of the review. The assessment was not \nquantitative; rather, it was simply heuristic to illustrate how \nright to health is affected by economic sanctions (according to \nHRIA framework). Based on the findings, related obligations \nof Iran and other states about effects of sanctions on Iranians’ \nright to health were extracted. In the case of incompatibility \n12 \n \nnumber of relevant in ternational laws that were identified was 13.

In the case of Iran, \nthe results of the literature review indicated that the sanctions \nadversely affected affordability, accessibility and quality of \nhealth services and medicine and exacerbated the living \nstandards of Iranians. In the next part, the effects of sanctions \non Iranians’ health and its determinants are explained. This \nis followed by a discussion on the obligations of Iran and \nother countries about the humanitarian consequences of the \nsanctions.\nPart 1) Iranian’s Enjoyment of Their Rights in Sanctions’ \nPeriod\nEffects of Economic Sanctions on Iranians’ Standard of Life\nAfter gauging the humanitarian impacts of sanctions on \nIranians’ lives, particularly their access to food and medicine \nthrough extensive news reports and reports of UN General \nSecretory, the United States permitted its companies to sell \nselected medicines and medical supplies to Iran without \nrequesting a license from the Treasury’s Office of Foreign \nAssets Control at the end of 2012. 92 Also, through the Joint \nPlan of Action, a channel for humanitarian support was \nestablished between Iran and six other countries in November \n2013.93 However, these exemptions of humanitarian trade, \ndid not guarantee Iranians’ access to food, medicine and \nmedical equipment. Since, limitations on trade, banking and \nfinancial system and shipment (mentioned before), made the \ntransferring of any goods, including those exempted ones to \nIran, extremely difficult and expensive.

In 2012, the overall inflation rate \nof consumer price index was 36% and 41.4% respectively in \ncities and rural areas. 95,96 Sanctions influenced all aspects of \nIran’s economy including public services that are necessary for \nwelfare of the population.71 They also contributed to increase \nof the rates of inflation and unemployment (Figure 3).71,80 Fall \nof Iran’s revenues led to decrease of government’s resources to \npay its employees’ salaries.85 Almost all Iranian manufactures \nwere hit by economic sanctions. Operating with partial \ncapacity, they could not pay timely wages (which were below \npoverty line) and had to fire many workers that deteriorated the \nliving conditions of workers and their families considerably.31 \nAs a result, purchasing power of population decreased (Figure \n3).34,86 Minimum wage decreased by more than 50% during \n2010 to 2012 ( Table 1 ).35 Sanctions influenced the socio-\neconomic status of the population, increased poverty and \nwidened the income gap between different groups of Iranian \nsociety and decreased welfare of the most vulnerable to a great \nextent.66,73,91,97 It was estimated that about 11% of Iranians were \nliving below absolute poverty line and 30% under relative \npoverty line in 2016.98 The population of the poor in rural and \nurban areas have been respectively 15% and 13% in 2012. 99 \nBy limiting revenues of the government, sanctions decreased \nthe capabilities of the state to support the poor.89 In 2013, the \nUN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in \nIran highlighted the dramatic effects of sanctions on Iranians’ \nstandard of living. 58 Sanctions affected people’s standard \nof living and violated their rights to education, health and \ndevelopment.77,84,85\nSharp declines in the value of Iran’s currency and the \ncountry’s dependency on the import of food and its related \nindustries and the subsequent change of Iran’s policy on \nsubsidized food caused a sharp rise in the price of food. As \na result of the significant increase in unemployment, many \nIranians reduced household expenditures by consuming \nless quality and quantity of food. 54,80,87,89 Moreover, along \nwith the deterioration of the economic situation of families, \nmore children left school to work, and got married to lower \nthe financial burden on their parents. In recent years, the \nnumber of working and street children has also increased \ndramatically. These children have limited access to health \nservices and education.57,58,61 According to Statistics Center of \nIran, formal child marriage increased more than 20% during \n2012-2014.100 In the province of Isfahan, the number of street \nchildren has increased by 120% during 2015-2016.101 There is \nno official data about the number of street children in Iran. \nStatistics provided by different institutions range from two to \nseven million street children. Based on the reports of National \nStatistics Center of Iran, 1.7 million children work in Iran.102 It \nwas estimated that this number has been about 700 thousands \nin 2009.103 This situation exposed children to violence, drug \naddiction, HIV infection and harmful work such as selling of \ndrugs. There are cases of child trafficking; even though it is \nconsidered a crime by the laws of Iran. 104\nFurthermore, in the sanctions period, women faced more \nsocio-economic hardships; job security and opportunities for \nwomen decreased.75 The effects have been more immense on \nwomen who were economically dependent to the family or \nwere heads of their family.71 A considerable number of Iranian \nwomen are unemployed and economically dependent to their \nspouses and children, and vulnerable to country’s economic \ndecline. Particularly female-headed households faced more \npoverty and often could not afford nutritious food and \nhealthcare in 2013 and 2014. 45,60,105 In addition, Iran is facing \na new phenomenon of street women and significant increase \nof addicted women and sex workers. Chronic poverty is \none of the main reasons of entering the illegal market of sex \nwork in Iran. 106 Furthermore, decline of financial ability of \nworking age people exacerbated the living situation of the \nelderly too. Old Iranians usually are financially dependent \nto their children; in recent years, the number of homeless \nelderly people has increased too. 58 A high percentage of \nyoung Iranians, including educated ones, are unemployed \nand living in poverty. In 2015, 57% of unemployed people \nwere at the age group 15-29. The unemployment ratio of this \nage group has increased by 2.6% comparing to 2014. 107 The \nrate of mental conditions such as depression and stress is high \namong unemployed young people. 108 Depression specifically \nincreased after intensifying sanctions against Iran due to \ndeterioration of people’s economic situation. 81 Furthermore, \nIran is one of the biggest hosts of refugees and asylum seekers \nin the world. Most of the refugees are from Afghanistan and \nIraq. The sanctions affected adversely the life of refugees in \nIran, and operational and humanitarian assistance costs of \nUN.59\nThe Impacts of Sanctions on Iranians’ Right to Health \nRights to healthcare and social security are guaranteed by \nthe Article 29 of Iran’s Constitution. In recent years, Iran has \nprovided free primary healthcare throughout the country and \nimproved the quality and quantity of health services to a great \nextent. However, over the years, financial accessibility of health \nservices has continuously declined; while health insurance \nsystem of Iran has not provided a universal coverage yet. \nMost of uninsured people are from the lowest income groups. \nPatients’ share of healthcare expenditure was 52% of total \nhealth expenditures and 88% of private health expenditures \nin 2012. The government and insurance companies paid the \nrest.109 \nIn 2012, with intensifying sanctions on Iran, inflation rate \nin health sector was 44.3% and 45.6% respectively in cities \nand rural areas. 110 Insurance companies reacted to the \ninflation by decreasing their list of services. It resulted in the \nKokabisaghi\nInternational Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2018, 7(5), 374–393386\nincrease of patients’ share of health services and ended in \nwithdrawal of healthcare and more reliance on self-treatment. \nSeveral studies showed increasing tendency of Iranians to \nself-medication; they have warned about adverse effects of \nreliance on self-treatment in Iran.111-113 Still services of public \nhealth facilities were cheaper than private ones; but they \nwere overcrowded and came with shortages and long waiting \nlists. In response, a few well-off patients traveled to other \ncountries to get healthcare. Some other patients, especially \nwith terminal and incurable illnesses, withdrew from health \nservices due to inability to pay. 47,114 Sanctions with a large \neconomic effect on a target country (similar to Iran’s case) can \nhave severe public health consequences which are very much \nsimilar to the effects of major military conflict. 83 Sanctions \non Iran had the potential to disrupt government’s subsidized \nhealthcare.62 Economic sanctions decreased the revenues of \nIran’s government and its ability to invest on health, education \nand social security of Iranians. 84,85 Also, they forced the \ngovernment to change the priorities of national investment \nfrom certain public responsibilities, such as supporting the \npoor.65 Therefore, the share of people of health services costs \nincreased that adversely affected access to healthcare. 70 Low \nincome groups were more vulnerable to the effects of the \nsanctions. The poor paid bigger proportion of their income on \nhealthcare.76,84,85 In 2013, Iran enacted a law to reform heath \nsystem; one part of this law requires the government to cover \nat least 90% of hospital services’ costs by public funds.84,115 But \nstill every year 1% of the population fall below poverty line \ndue to catastrophic health expenditures. 116\nBy limiting access to necessities of life, sanctions against Iran \nendangered public health particularly health of mothers, \nchildren and the poor. 70 Economic sanctions have had other \nimpacts on health of people in Iran. For example, due to ban on \nfuel trade and related production knowledge and technology, \nlocally produced poorly refined fuel was substituted that had \nthe main role in polluting the air all over the country. 52,89,90 \nEconomic sanctions influenced production models from \nclean production techniques to pollutant ones and led to \nmore use of old technologies and air pollution.89 About 45 000 \ndeaths in one year and increase of lung cancer cases among \nchildren were reported to be linked to air pollution in Iran. 61 \nAnother example is ban of selling air craft parts to Iran that \nresulted in unsafe flights and endangered lives of people. \nThe same happened to automobile industry equipment. \nThe sanctions also might endanger mental health of people \nbecause of continuous signals of threats and deteriorated \nliving situation. Recently, the rates of mental diseases and drug \naddiction and cases of suicide among Iranians have increased \nconsiderably. According to the report of Iran’s Ministry of \nHealth and Medical Education, the rate of mental diseases has \nincreased 4% in recent four years. The suicide rate increased \n7.6% during 2012-2013. 117,118 Unemployment and financial \ndistress are two main causes of mental conditions in Iran.119 A \nstudy in the province of Ghazvin showed that unemployment, \ninflation and welfare inequality had a meaningful relation \nwith suicide rates. 120 Another example is the impacts of \neconomic decline on drug addicts and their families. While \nthe price of medicines for treatment of drug addiction and \ndrugs itself increased, having less financial means, drug \nusers tend to decrease spending on their family’s life and \nuse cheaper substances. 68,121 New substances are associated \nwith high risk methods of use such as injection and high risk \nsexual practices and more acts of violence and can have long \nterm effects on body organs. 122\nThe harms of economic sanctions to health indicators can \nremain hidden for several years and become evident in a longer \nperiod. As an example, unavailability of financial resources \ncaused by sanctions is known as an obstacle to meet the goals \nof Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases \nProgram in Iran. 56 Sanctions can have more direct and \nimmediate adverse effects on health by limiting the availability \nand accessibility of medicine. In theory, medicine exempted \nfrom sanctions against Iran, but in practice, access of patients \nto quality medicine became limited due to the sanctions of \n2012. The report of UN Special Rapporteur on the situation \nof human rights in Iran 2013 indicated that “humanitarian \nsafeguards in the form of exemptions for foodstuffs, \nmedicines, chemicals for the production of medications and \nmedical supplies are failing to meet their intended purpose. \nReports indicate that financial sector sanctions effectively \nfrustrate the purpose behind humanitarian exceptions. They \nalso stress that the supply of advanced medicines, which treat \nthe most serious illnesses, are particularly affected. Advanced \nmedicines are produced primarily by firms based in Western \ncountries and are subject to 20-year patents, rendering it \nimpossible to substitute products from an alternative source. ” \nThe ineffectiveness of humanitarian safeguards is apparent in \nIran.58\nEffects of Sanctions on Right to Medicine\nUniversal right to safe, effective and affordable medicine \nis a fundamental element of right to health; states should \nconsider this right in their international agreements. 123 By \nhaving a national generic policy, a network for provision and \ndistribution of medicine and an overarching pricing system \nfor medicine around the country, Iran had a satisfactory \nlevel of access to medicine and medical instruments before \ncomprehensive sanctions. 49,63 Depended to the type of \nservices, insurance companies cover 70%-90% of retail price \nof medicines. Iran produces about 96% of all the medications \nof its pharmaceutical market in the terms of number and \nvolume. But, the value of imported medicine is about 40% of \nwhole market’s value. 46\nWith the tightening up of sanctions in 2012, the situation \nchanged; government faced difficulties in provision of \nmedicine; locally produced and imported medical equipment \nand medicines started to be scarce. 66,67,78,80 Medicines were \nnot subject to sanctions, but limitations on licensing, \npurchase and shipment of goods to Iran made the import \nof medicines difficult. Also, Iran is dependent to import of \npharmaceutical’s raw materials, and production and quality \ncontrol technologies which were not exempted from sanctions. \nTherefore, the sanctions crippled domestic pharmaceutical \nindustry and disrupted the production and quality of generic \nmedicine too. 51,55,69 International pharmaceutical companies \n(and banks) were reluctant to deal with Iran because of the \nKokabisaghi\nInternational Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2018, 7(5), 374–393 387\npotential threat of secondary sanctions and difficulties of \nreceiving payment.50 Being cut off from international banking \nnetwork, Iranian government had to pay cash in advance \nthat was very difficult, if not impossible, for mass imports \nof medicines. Moreover, the shortage of foreign currency \nand decline of country’s currency value made medicines \nexpensive.69 In addition, a complex process of providing \nbanking facilities to importers and extremely lengthy process \nof importation caused further shortages. Therefore, the \ncheapest medicines such as contraception pills and simple \nmedical instruments such as vaccines, sutures and endoscopy \ninstruments were not available by 2012. 39 These all indicate \nthat pharmaceutical system of Iran has been weak in provision \nof medicine in emergency and unusual situations such as \neconomic sanctions. 64\nFollowing multilateral sanction as of 2012, the import of \nmedicines and raw medical materials fell by 30%-55% 58 and \nthe average shortage of medicine from less than 30 in type \nreached to 144.52 Forty-four percent of scarce medicines were \nclassified as essential medicines (minimum requirement \nfor a functioning health system) by WHO. A vast majority \nof these medicines were supposed to be exempted from the \nsanctions.53 Access to nuclear medicines and radiotherapy \npieces for diagnoses and treatment of cancer were completely \ncut off, since they were in the list of sanctions due to the \npossibility of military usage. 43,47 Several studies showed that \naccess of about 6 million patients with life-threatening diseases \nsuch as asthma, thalassemia, hemophilia, chronic diseases, \nblood disorders, multiple sclerosis and HIV/AIDS to their \nmedicines was limited.44 In addition, anti-rejection transplant \nmedicines, and kidney dialysis instruments were scarce by \n2013.42,48 Domestically produced replacements were scarce \nand not effective enough. Unavailability and unaffordability \nof medicines resulted in poor drug adherence. 66 A number \nof deaths due to a lack of access to medicines were reported \nin 2012.55,124 Furthermore, the shortage of medicines reduced \nthe ability of health system to provide services even in \nemergencies; suspended operations were serious problems \nfollowing sanctions 2012.48 Moreover, Iran does not produce \ndrugs for eradicated diseases and raw material for antibiotics \nthat can threaten universal public health. For example, Iran \ncould not produce BCG vaccine till 2015. Moreover, shortages \nof medicines and medical equipment needed for diagnosis and \ntreatment of some diseases might change the county’s overall \ndisease burden; the number of deaths by non-communicable \ndiseases (including cancer, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular \ndiseases, digestive diseases, skin diseases, musculoskeletal \ndiseases, and congenital anomalies) has increased in recent \nyears in Iran. 52\nTo compensate 30%-46% fall of medicines’ import from the \nUnited States and EU during 2011-2012, Iran increased its \npurchase of medicine and medical equipment from countries \nthat did not ban oil trade with Iran. From 2012, the purchase \nof medicine from China and India increased respectively 2 \nand 5 times.110 However, the alternative medicines usually had \nlower quality and limited effectiveness than equivalents from \nEurope or United States.32,69 Moreover, medicines have to be \nregistered and their safety and effectiveness must be approved \nby Iran’s Medicine and Food Organization to be allowed \nto be produced, imported and distributed in Iran. 125 This \nprocess takes several months. In response to the shortages, \nIran allowed medicines which were approved by US Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) or European countries to \nbe imported without assessment and national approval. But \nthis resulted in major side-effects including intolerance by the \npatients to a change in a long term treatment. 32 On the other \nhand, due to the absence of official supplies in health facilities \nand pharmacies, smuggled medicines increased in the local \nmarket of Iran. They were often out of date, of poor quality, \ncontaminated, or spoiled by climate extremes. They were also \nsold at a price several times higher than the official price. It \nwas also difficult to know whether they were counterfeit or \nreal.41 In 2013, following eye surgery, 22 patients got serious \ninfection in their eyes and were in danger of losing their \nvisions because of using a non-standard ampoule. 126\nEconomic sanctions also made medicines financially \ninaccessible from 2012 to 2013. The increase in medicines’ \nprice was 50%-75% during this period. 44 The price of most \nmedications has not been a problem until recent years in \nIran. To guarantee access of people, Iran provides a subsidy \nfor selected medicines. Usually, the amount of subsidy is \ndetermined at the end of each year based on the estimation \nof medicines’ price and country’s revenues in the coming \nyear. The sharp fall of revenues and in the value of country’s \ncurrency was not predicted in 2012. After facing shortages, \nIran allocated more financial resources and foreign currencies \nfor the import of medicines and could establish companies \nin neighboring countries to use their banking system for \npurchasing medicine. As a result, many key medicines are \nnow available; but still it is expensive for some diseases. The \nsituation is more difficult for the poorest people who are \nnot insured. In this condition, some health services such as \ndental care has become a privilege which is inaccessible to the \nworking and middle classes of population. 40\nHuman Rights Impact Assessment of Economic Sanctions \nAgainst Iran\nThe results of the literature review concur that economic \nsanctions against Iran have resulted in depriving Iran’s \npopulation of their economic and social rights, specifically the \nright to health and its determinants. About 80% of the studied \npapers indicated that sanctions adversely affected access to \nhealth services and related products. Sixty-three percent \nof papers confirmed the inaccessibility and affordability of \nmedicine for the population. Moreover, 56% of the papers \nshowed that sanctions affected the determinants of health \nsuch as environment health, employment and access to food. \nThe sanctions on Iran caused a fall in the country’s revenues, \ndevaluation of the national currency, and increased inflation \nand unemployment. These all resulted in a deterioration of \npeople’s overall welfare and lowering their ability to access the \nnecessities of a standard life such as nutritious food, healthcare \nand medicine. Also, sanctions on banking and financial system \nand shipment led to scarcity of quality lifesaving medicines. \nThe impacts of sanctions were more immense on lives of the \npoor, patients, women and children. According to HRIA tool, \nKokabisaghi\nInternational Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2018, 7(5), 374–393388\nthe economic sanctions against Iran have  had a significant \nhumanitarian effect; therefore they should be reconsidered. \nTo place pressure on Iran to limit its nuclear activities, other \nmeasures should be used instead that do not have such effects. \nWhile international peace should be respected, human rights \nobligations cannot be forgotten. Review of the obligations of \nIran and international community about Iranians’ right to \nhealth is essential when considering compensation measures. \nPart 2) States’ Obligations in Sanctions Period\nTo protect people in the sanctions period, imposing countries, \ninternational community and target country have human \nrights obligations. The fundamental part of these obligations \nis that everybody should enjoy his/her rights without \ndiscrimination of any kind. \nTargeted Country’s Obligations in the Sanctions Period\nReview of Iran’s response to the sanctions indicates that this \ncountry has not been prepared for the sanctions, delayed in \nresponding to shortages and could not manage the situation \nappropriately. Also, bureaucratic constraints, corruption \nand inefficient resources management contributed to the \ndeterioration of people’s enjoyment of their basic rights. 51,71 \nIn the period between announcement and implementation \nof the sanctions, Iran should have provided a national policy \nwith suitable measures to prevent suffering of people from \nthe adverse effects of sanctions and to ensure everyone enjoys \nhis/her basic rights including right to health. The failure to \ntake appropriate steps towards progressively realization of \nright to health and to enforce related laws is in contrast with \ninternational human rights obligations. Moreover, Iran should \nhave prevented third parties; black market dealers, pharmacies \nand health facilities that provided unsafe medicines, as well as \nsmugglers who sent scarce medicine to neighboring countries \nfrom violation of people’s rights. Failure to regulate third \nparties’ activities is against the right to health. 20\nCountries targeted by sanctions should respect international \npeace, security and human rights obligations to alleviate a \nhumanitarian crisis.127 In the sanctions period, the government \nof the target country has human rights obligations. People’s \nlack of access to nutritious food, primary healthcare, basic \nshelter and education indicates that the country has failed \nto discharge its obligations under ICESCR. The State is \nrequired to monitor human rights situation and utilize the \nmaximum resources available to eliminate the suffering with \nlow cost programs, international assistance and cooperation. \nMoreover, even in severe resource limitations, vulnerable \ngroups of the population such as children and the poor must \nbe protected. Non-compliance with the core obligations \nof right to health (access to health facilities, products and \nservices and minimum essential food, basic shelter, sanitation \nand safe water) cannot be justified under any circumstances.20 \nThe CRC also states that children are entitled to human \nrights; parents without enough means should be supported \nto provide a standard of life for their children. Governments \nshould prohibit child marriage, child trafficking, child work, \nviolence against children and engagement of children in \ndrug selling. The needs of immigrants’ and asylum seekers’ \nchildren should be taken into account too.128 Generally, states \nhave the obligations to respect, protect and fulfill right to \nhealth. They must ensure that everyone, without any kinds \nof discrimination, enjoys this right. In all times, including the \nperiod of sanctions, states are required to provide available, \naccessible, acceptable and good quality facilities, goods and \nservices related to health and its determinants to everyone. \nIn addition, they are required to use all necessary means, \nthe maximum of their available resources and to adopt \nappropriate legislative, administrative, budgetary, judicial, \npromotional and other measures towards the full realization \nof right to health.20 There is the possibility to seek international \nassistance for realization of the right to health too. \nInternational Community’s Obligations \nThe international community has two kinds of obligations \nin relation to the right to health. First, in cooperation with \ninternational organizations, all countries are required to \nprovide conditions at international and regional levels to \nensure everyone enjoys the right to the highest attainable \nstandard of physical and mental health. They should help \ndeveloping countries to progressively realize this right through \nthe establishment of effective and integrated health systems \nwith adequate, affordable and reliable and good quality \nsupply of medicines. 129 Second, they should avoid violation \nof this right and prevent third parties such as international \norganizations and groups of countries also violating this \nright.20 According to the UN Charter 1945, Security Council \nmay decide what measures including sanctions should be \nemployed to maintain or restore international peace and \nsecurity.16 Generally, economic sanctions which are imposed \nby some countries against the others are inconsistent with \nthe Charter’s basic principles of equality and dignity of every \nhuman being. Resolution 39/210 of UN General Assembly \n1984 states: \nDeveloped countries should refrain from threatening \nor applying trade and financial restrictions, blockades, \nembargoes, and other economic sanctions, incompatible \nwith the provisions of the Charter of the UN and in \nviolation of undertakings contracted, multilaterally \nand bilaterally, against developing countries as a form \nof political and economic coercion that affects their \npolitical, economic, and social development. 130\nThe Vienna Declaration and Program of Action 1993 requires \nthe states “to refrain from any unilateral measure not in \naccordance with international law and the Charter of the \nUN that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and \nimpedes the full realization of the human rights set forth in \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international \nhuman rights instruments, in particular the rights of \neveryone to a standard of living adequate for their health and \nwell-being, including food and medical care, housing and the \nnecessary social services. ”131 Adoption of laws interfering with \nthe enjoyment of right to health, failure to take into account \nthe legal obligations related to this right in bilateral and \nmultilateral agreements and also failure to regulate activities \nof third parties in order to prevent them from violating right \nto health are violations of the ICESCR obligations. Imposing \nKokabisaghi\nInternational Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2018, 7(5), 374–393 389\nembargos and other measures that restrict the supply of \nanother state with adequate medicine and medical equipment \nshould be refrained. The Committee on ESCR prohibits \nrestriction on these goods as a tool for political and economic \npressure. States must respect the enjoyment of right to health \nin other countries by refraining from denying or limiting the \naccess of people to healthcare and medicine. They must ensure \nthat their international agreements do not adversely impact \nupon this right. The states who are members of international \nand regional financial institutions should consider protection \nof the right to health in their credit agreements and lending \npolicies.20\nStates are responsible legally for their policies that violate \nhuman rights of people beyond their borders and for the \npolicies that support this action by third parties. According to \nparagraph 39 of General Comment no 14 ICESCR, “to comply \nwith their international obligations in relation to article 12, \nStates parties have to respect the enjoyment of the right to health \nin other countries, and to prevent third parties from violating \nthe right in other countries, if they are able to influence these \nthird parties by way of legal or political means, in accordance \nwith the Charter of the UN and applicable international law. ”11 \nCountries that impose, maintain or implement sanctions \nshould take immediate steps to respond to the suffering \nexperienced by people in targeted countries. 20 This can be \ndone by facilitating the delivery of necessary items for life and \nhealth such as medicine, food and medical equipment. The \nstates imposing sanctions should carefully assess the effects \nof their policies and international agreements on the health of \npeople in the target country. Subsequently, they must develop \npolicies and laws to alleviate the negative impacts of their \nagreements on the human rights of population in the target \ncountry.132 A country’s population should not be deprived of \ntheir basic ESCRs due to any determination that their leaders \nhave violated international peace and security norms. 20 The \ninternational community must protect the core content of the \nESCRs of targeted population. UN bodies should observe the \nsituation of human rights and implement humanitarian and \nhuman rights laws. Otherwise, basic principles underpinning \ninternational law such as equality of all human beings will lose \ncredibility. In addition, the Security Council should alleviate \nsanctions regimes in order to eliminate the humanitarian \neffects of sanctions on target population and ensure that \nthey have access to food, medicines and other necessities of \npreserving health.127 It seems that regulations on humanitarian \nexemptions are formulated imprecisely and confusing; they \nlack standards and an impact monitoring system. Also, \nexempted goods and their distribution are poorly understood \nand interpreted, and often the urgent delivery of humanitarian \nsupplies is blocked.7,133 These all have major implications on \nthe basic rights of the population of target country.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nAccording to the results of HRIA, economic sanctions \nagainst Iran have resulted in violation of Iranians’ right to \nhealth. There is incompatibility between obligations derived \nfrom economic sanction agreements and human rights. \nIn this case, HRIA suggests several options: termination \nor amendment of the policy, insertion of safeguards, and \nadoption of compensation measures. The main principle of \nthis assessment is that no policy at national and international \nlevel should breach international human rights laws. This \ntool, at first step, suggests that such policies should be \nstopped. However, it does not mean that countries should not \nface any limitation if they threaten international peace, rather \nit means such policies should protect people’s basic human \nrights too. The assumption behind economic sanctions is \nthat economic pressure on the population of a country forces \nthe government to reconsider its policies. The statement \nthat economic sanctions do not target humanitarian goods \nseems incorrect when they aim to diminish the main source \nof a state’s revenue. The level of realization of human rights \nis dependent to the state’s income level. Therefore, economic \nsanctions endanger current level of people’s enjoyment of \ntheir right to health by decreasing available resources of a \ncountry to be spent on the health of population. \nDespite the international community’s statement that sanctions \nare directed at the government of Iran for its nuclear program, \nduring the sanctions period, the enjoyment of Iranians of \ntheir fundamental rights has been dramatically decreased. \nThe sanctions affected health of Iranians in two ways; first by \ndeteriorating their living conditions through rise of inflation \nand unemployment, and decline of households’ income and \naccess to adequate nutritious food and healthcare; then, by \ndirect effect on the availability, accessibility and quality of \nlifesaving medicines. Humanitarian exemptions which were \nestablished after the call of shortage could not protect the \npopulation from adverse effects of sanctions. If the purpose \nof sanctions has been refraining Iran from developing nuclear \nweapons, sanctions should have been all about the materials \nand technology related to this program and targeted decision-\nmaking elites, not ordinary people. Although, it seems that \nthe world overlooked countries that actively have nuclear \nweapons without ratification of Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons Treaty.\nAccording to international human rights laws, right to \nhealth is a justiciable right. 134 The countries imposing \nsanctions, UN treaty bodies and Iran itself are responsible \nfor the humanitarian effects of sanctions on Iranians’ lives. \nIran could not appropriately handle the humanitarian crisis \ncaused by sanctions and still be able to maintain the level of \nits population’s enjoyment of their basic rights. The country \nshould have predicted the impacts of sanctions and planned for \nthe protection of its population. But some of the consequences \nof the sanctions such as the difficulty in access to medicines \n(which were in theory exempted from sanctions) were \ndifficult to be predicted. It shows that laws on “humanitarian \nexemptions” solely do not protect the rights of the population \nof targeted countries. On the other hand, through joining UN \nand ratifying human rights treaties, almost all countries around \nthe world are committed to respect human rights of everyone \nwithout any kinds of discrimination. No international human \nrights treaty questions the equality of human beings in their \ninherent dignity and fundamental rights. It is thus against all \nthese treaties to assume that violation of people’s rights in one \ncountry, through pressure of sanctions is acceptable. Olivier \nKokabisaghi\nInternational Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2018, 7(5), 374–393390\nDe Schutter, UN Special Rapporteur of the right to food in \nhis report of 2011 stated that a state who uses its means of \ninfluence, such as its economic leverage to induce policies in \nanother state’s jurisdiction that undermines the targeted state’s \nhuman rights obligations, is responsible for violation of rights \nunder international law.135 Iran has not been the first country \nthat has faced sanctions; therefore the adverse impacts of \nsanctions on this country could be predictable by UN \nSecurity Council and by the countries which imposed them. \nIn future, prior to the imposition of any economic sanctions, \nthe international community must use effective measures \nto protect the human rights of target country’s population. \nCountries should also use every political and legal means \nto prevent violation of the rights of these people by other \ncountries or international organizations. International laws \nrelated to economic sanctions also need improvement. All the \nUN organs’ resolutions on economic sanctions are similar in \ncontent and are not deterrent enough. These resolutions are \nsoft laws advising targeting and targeted countries to respect \nhuman rights. However, no international accountability \nsystem is established for countries which impose economic \nsanctions and do not conform to these laws. According to \nGeneral Comment no 14 ICESCR, effective judicial and \nappropriate remedies at national and international levels \nshould be provided for people whose rights are violated. 20 \nEven following dissemination of the report of the Special \nRapporteur on Human Rights and UN General Secretary \nabout humanitarian effects of sanctions on Iran, the imposing \ncountries were not compelled to lift sanctions. The UN \nas a “center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the \nattainment of peace” 16 should take a clear position about \nbilateral sanctions or “measures” such as these, imposed \narbitrarily by countries or groups of countries against another \none.\nMoreover, in the case of Iran, humanitarian exemptions were \ndecided too late, while the process of implementation of the \nexemptions was not clear. Prior to the imposition of sanctions, \nan international order for the protection of people should be \nestablished and some international intermediate organizations \nand certain companies and financial institutions should be \ndesignated to facilitate the implementation of exemptions. \nFurthermore, the effects of sanctions should be continuously \nmonitored; if basic human rights are affected, the sanctions \nshould be reviewed. Economic sanctions in their current \nmethod of implementation are “collective punishment” and \nviolation of all human rights treaties. By putting such great \npressure on the population of a country, other countries \nwill not also be safe. The prevalence of diseases and internal \nconflicts in a country, as results of economic sanctions, \nare threats to international health and peace. People who \nfind their rights violated seek asylums in other countries. \nConsidering human rights approach in foreign policies might \nbe a better solution than economic sanctions for resolving \ninternational disputes. \nRecently, a proposal is suggested by imposing countries to \nlift sanctions on Iran due to a shift in Iran’s nuclear policies. \nHowever, the adverse consequences of economic sanctions \nhave already taken place and will take a long time to be \nalleviated, if not impossible. The social impact of economic \nsanctions against Iran may extend beyond the sanction period \nbecause the costs of imposing sanctions exceed the benefits of \nlifting sanctions. Moreover, lifting sanctions necessarily will \nnot lead to improving living standards and welfare of Iranians \nif this country does not invest more on the population. After \nimproving access to medicine and allocating more funds to \nhealth system, now, Iran needs to make considerable efforts \nto improve the living conditions of the people, especially \nthe poor and children by using all the necessary means \nand recourses available. In addition, this country must \nconsider new policies to protect civilians from the violation \nof their rights in similar situations. Imposing countries and \nthe international community are also responsible for the \nhumanitarian consequences of their actions and should aid \nIran by any appropriate or necessary means to alleviate the \nsituation and to allow Iranians to enjoy their human rights \nwhich have been affected by the sanctions.\nEthical issues \nNot applicable.\nCompeting interests \nAuthor declares that she has no competing interests. \nAuthor’s contribution \nFK is the single author of the paper.\nReferences\n1.
