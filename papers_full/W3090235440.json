  "abstract": "The thermophysical and electrical properties of graphene–transformer oil nanofluid at three weight percentage concentrations (0.01%, 0.03%, and 0.05%) were experimentally studied. Experiments conducted to find viscosity, surface tension, density, specific resistance, electrical conductivity, and dielectric dissipation at various temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 90 °C. It was noted that the nanofluid with 0.05% concentration showed an enhancement of 2.5% and 16.6% for density and viscosity, respectively, when compared to transformer oil. In addition, an average reduction in surface tension is noted to be 10.1% for the maximum concentration of nanofluid. Increase in heat load and concentration improves Brownian motion and decreases the cohesive force between these particles, which results in a reduction in surface tension and increases the heat-transfer rate compared to transformer oil. In addition, for the maximum concentration of nanoparticles, the electrical conductivity of nanofluid was observed to be 3.76 times higher than that of the transformer oil at 90 °C. The addition of nanoparticles in the transformer oil decreases the specific resistance and improves the electrical conductivity thereby enhancing the breakdown voltage. Moreover, the thermophysics responsible for the improvement in thermophysical and electrical properties are discussed clearly, which will be highly useful for the design of power transmission/distribution systems.",
