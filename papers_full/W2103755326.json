Introduction \n \nMineral oils are the most commonly used fluids for \nelectrical insulation and heat transfer in electric power \napparatus and systems [1]. The major problem faced \nwith mineral oil is that it is poorly biodegradable and \ncould cause serious contamin ation of soil and waterways \nif spills occur. In addition, it is estimated that petroleum \nproducts are eventually going to run out leading to serious \nshortages of mineral oil by the mid-twenty first century. \nHence, it is necessary to ca rryout extensive studies in \nthe development of new biodegradable insulating fluids. \nVegetable oils are natural products and are plenty of \nsupply. The most attractive features of vegetable oils are that \nthey are biodegradable, non-toxic and most environmental \nfriendly. Extensive studies we re carried out for the past \ntwo decades to find a suitabl e alternate vegetable oil for \nelectrical applications [2-1 4]. The major problem faced \nwith the liquid insulation for transformer applications is the \naging and degradation of the insulating medium due to \nvarious stresses such as electr ical and thermal, which in \nturn affects the long-term perf ormance of the oil. There is \nnow considerable interest in understanding the thermal \naging characteristics of vegetable oils which is not yet well \nreported [8-11].  \nPartial discharge (PD) due to  electric field enhancement \nin a localized area of insulation accelerates the degradation \nand thermal aging of the insulating oil. Hence it plays a \nmajor role in determining the insulation strength and life \ntime of oil. Therefore, it is important to understand the PD \ncharacteristics of vegetable oils before recommending them \nas an alternate of mineral oil for high voltage transformer \napplications. PD detection and analysis is now a well \nrecognized insulation monitoring method in determining \nthe quality of insulation. However, the PD characteristics \nof vegetable oils such as corn oil and palm oil under \nunaged and thermally aged conditions are scanty.  \nConsidering these facts, the major aim of the present \nwork is to collect the typical PD patterns from palm and \ncorn oils in order to find its suitability for power \napparatus applications. In this  paper, phase resolved PD \ncharacteristics and breakdown strength characteristics of \ncorn oil and palm oil under unaged and thermally aged \nconditions are investigated. For comparison purpose, the \nPD characteristics of mineral oil are also discussed. Time \nand frequency domain analysis of  PD pulses are discussed. \nStatistical analysis of PD pattern i.e. skewness and shape \nparameter variations with respect to applied thermal stress \nare also carried out.  \n \n \n2.

Chandrasekar \n 1661\n(FFA) of 3 % and palm oil with FFA of 1% supplied by \nGR brand were used in the present study. Commercially \navailable TRANSOL brand mineral oil was used for the \nexperimental studies and the characteristics of oils are \ngiven in Table 1. Initially, in order to remove any moisture \ncontent present, oil sample was kept in a sealed steel \ncontainer and thermally treated at 70 ˚C for 48 hours \ninside a temperature controlled oven and then the sample \nwas allowed to cool to room temperature for 24 hours. \nAccelerated thermal aging was performed in the laboratory \nto expose the oil to extreme temperature conditions for a \ncertain period of time in order to understand the change in \ndielectric characteristics at elev ated temperatures. In this \nthermal aging process, oil samples were kept in sealed \nsteel containers and placed inside a temperature controlled \noven at 150˚C and taken out after 15 days, 30 days and 45 \ndays. In order to understand the influence of transformer \nwindings and its catalytic eff ects during the thermal aging, \noil sample was also added with copper pieces (1 mm \ndiameter and 5 cm length) during aging process [8]. Unless \notherwise mentioned, the results reported in this paper for \nthermally aged oil samples are without copper.  \n \n2.1 Breakdown Voltage (BDV) Test \n \nThe value of breakdown voltage gives the electrical \nstrength of the insulating medium. This test was carried out \nas per IEC 60156 standard. Fig. 1 shows the schematic \ndiagram of the experimental setup used to evaluate the \nbreakdown voltage of oil samples. Initially the oil samples \nwere filtered using a 5 micron filter paper in order to \nremove any impurities present in the oil. Test chamber, \nconsisting of spherical electrodes of 12.5 mm diameter \nand separated by 2.5 mm gap distance, was filled with the \ninsulating oil. High voltage AC supply was slowly \nincreased at a rate of 2 kV/s until the breakdown occurs. \nA time delay of 1 minute is used between successive \nbreakdowns. This test was carried out for both virgin and \nthermally aged oil samples, at different electrode gap \ndistances such as 1, 2, 2.5 and 3mm and corresponding \nbreakdown voltage was noted. Eight breakdowns on the \nsame specimen were carried out and the average value was \nused as the electrical strength of insulation oil. \n \n2.2 Partial Discharge test \n \nA partial discharge in a high voltage transformer occurs \nwhen the electric field enhances in a localized area of \ninsulation. Partial discharge detection is one of the most \nimportant diagnostic techniques used to assess condition of \nhigh voltage insulation in transformer. The most likely \ntypes of PDs in a transformer can be broken down into \ntwo categories such as corona discharges and surface \ndischarges. Corona discharge may be due to any floating \nconducting particle in the insulating medium. Surface \ndischarges in transformers mainly occur in the surface of \npressboard layers. \nIn the present work, in order to simulate corona \ndischarge, a needle-plane electrode configuration was used. \nPartial discharge measurement is carried out according to \nIEC 60270 test procedures. Fig. 2 shows the test cell with \nneedle-plane electrode configuration. The tip of the needle \nhas a curvature radius of 1.5 μm. The test specimen is \nenergized from a step up transformer which can supply \nvoltage upto 100 kV . Primary side of the high voltage \ntransformer is connected to a control panel and a 230 V \nAC supply. The high voltage was connected to the needle \nelectrode and the plane elec trode was solidly grounded. \nSince it is difficult to get a stable PD source from the \nneedle-plane electrode configuration, a 3 mm thick \npressboard was used upon the ground electrode. The gap \ndistance between the needle  and ground electrode was \nmaintained at 5 mm.  \nPD signals were picked by connecting a high frequency \ncurrent transformer (HFCT) around the ground connection \nof the test cell. HFCT is a clip on device clamped around \nthe ground lead and it has a 50 MHz frequency bandwidth \nwhich is sufficient to cover the entire range of PD. Output \nof the HFCT is connected to the PD detector. Partial \ndischarges were detected through a large bandwidth system, \nTable 1.

The sensitivity ranges \nfrom 2 mV/div to 5V/div. PDBASE II also provides large \nnumber of digitized PD pulse waveforms and it is able to \nseparate them according to the PD waveform shape [15-18]. \nThe PD pulses were sent to a remote PC for further \nprocessing.  \n \n \n3. Distribution Analysis of Breakdown  \nStrength \n \nIt is important to understand the correlation between \nthe dispersion of breakdown voltages between the \nmineral oil and vegetable oils in order to estimate the \nsafety margin while designing the insulation of electric \npower apparatus. Fig. 3 shows the breakdown voltage \ncharacteristics of oil samples at different gap distance of \nthe electrodes with respect to thermal aging time. \nMinimum and maximum values of breakdown strength \nobtained during the experimental studies at each aging time \nperiod are also shown in Fig. 3. For comparison purpose, \nconventionally used mineral oil characteristics are also \nplotted. \nSuwarno Aditama [6], have re ported that increase in fat \ncontent considerably reduces the BDV value and palm oil \nwith lower fat content showed BDV value more than 30 kV . \nThe slight reduction in BDV value of corn oil may be due \nto the higher fat content compared with palm oil. With \nrespect to increase in therma l aging time, the breakdown \nstrength of mineral oil reduces considerably, whereas \ninterestingly the palm oil and corn oil shows increase in \nbreakdown strength after 15 days of thermal aging. This \nincrease in BDV can only be attributed to a chemical \nchange of the oil and similar results of increasing BDV \nafter aging when compared with unaged oil is already \nreported [11]. After 30 days and 45 days of thermal aging, \na steep reduction in breakdown strength of vegetable oils is \nnoticed, the reason may be that due to long period of \nthermal stress, the fat in the oil due to oxidation may \nrelease volatile acid, aldehyde, water and may be also \nhydrogen gas. Increase in acid value and water content due \nto severe thermal aging and increase in oxidation products \nmight have reduced the breakdown voltage [6]. However, \ndecrease in breakdown strength of vegetable oil is \nrelatively lower when compared with mineral oil. It may be \ndue to the reason that vegetable oils make less sludge \nformation when react with oxyg en [10]. In general, with \nrespect to increase in gap di stance between the electrodes, \nconsiderable increase in breakdown strength is noticed for \nall oil specimens.  \nBreakdown strength of a liquid dielectric medium is a \nstatistical quantity which depends on the physico-chemical \nproperties, impurities and par ticles present in the medium \nduring test. Therefore statistical techniques have been \nextensively applied to understand the insulation failure. \nD. Martin et al., [14] ha ve reported that Weibull \ndistribution tends to give closer results than the Gaussian \ndistribution in the statistical analysis of the AC breakdown \nvoltages of ester based transformer oils as it does not make \nassumptions of the skewness and kurtosis. Hence, in this \nwork, two parameter Weibull distribution is used to fit the \nbreakdown voltages. The Weibull cumulative distribution \nfunction, F, is defined as \n \n \n() 1 e x p bd\nbd\nVFV\nβ\nα\n⎡⎤ ⎛⎞=− − ⎢⎥ ⎜⎟⎝⎠⎢⎥⎣⎦\n  (1) \n \nwhere α is the scale parameter, which is the voltage at \nwhich 63% of the oil specimens have broken down and β \nis the shape parameter, which is the Weibull modulus \nindicating the width of the distribution. MA TLAB software \nwas used to carry out Weibull analysis. \nFig. 4 shows the Weibull distribution of breakdown \nvoltage characteristics of una ged oil samples, where the \ndotted line represents the fit to the data and the thick lines \ngive 95% confidence intervals for these probabilities. \nCorresponding scale parameter ( α) and shape parameter \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFig. 3.

Chandrasekar \n 1663\n(β)  strength of oil samples. The shape parameter β is \ncorrelated with the breakdown strength dispersion. Shape \nparameter value of mineral oil lies below 15, whereas for \nboth corn and palm oil lies above 25, which implies that \npalm and corn oils have smaller dispersion of breakdown \nvoltages. Standard deviation of BDV data was calculated \nand found to be 1, 1.13 and 3 for palm, corn and mineral \noil respectively and is in similar line withWeibull data \nanalysis.  \nFig. 5 show the variations in scale parameters of oil \nsamples at different electrode gap values. In this plot, M, \nP and C stand for mineral oil, palm oil and corn oil \nrespectively. Similarly, V , 30 and 45 stand for unaged, 30 \ndays thermal aged, 45 days thermal aged respectively. It \ncan be seen that, in general, palm and corn oil have better \nelectrical breakdown strength and smaller breakdown \nvoltage data dispersion than mineral oil. In the case of \nmineral oil, thermal aging reduces considerably the scale \nparameter. However, even after 45 days of thermal stress, a \nslight reduction in scale parameter of palm oil and corn oil \nis noticed, but they still maintain BDV values close to 30 \nkV (2.5 mm gap).  \nIn general, from the BDV test results it is noticed that \npalm and corn oils have the ability to retain the breakdown \nstrength even under accelerated  thermal aging for longer \nperiods compared with conventionally used mineral oil. \nAs discussed earlier, this may be due to the lowest turbidity \nand fat content between the molecules of the vegetable \noils [6].  \n \n \n4. Phase Resolved PD Pattern Analysis \n \n4.1 PRPD pattern analysis \n \nIn the needle-plane electrode configuration, initially the \npartial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) was evaluated. \nPDIV is the lowest voltage at which observable PD pulses \nappear on the PD detector. Pompili et al., [21] have \nreported that determination of PDIV in the case of liquid \ndielectrics is difficult because PD pulses appear in pulse \nbursts and their occurrence rate is more erratic. \nPD signals were measured in stable condition after \nvoltage application and a set of 5 PD measurements were \ncarried out at each voltage level in order to extract the \n95 % of confidence level. Fig. 6 shows the PDIV of oil \nsamples measured at 5 mm gap distance between the \nelectrodes. In general, vegetable oils showed higher PDIV \nwhen compared with mineral oil. It is clear that thermal \naging significantly reduced th e PDIV . From the aged oil \nsample results, it is clear that palm and corn oil has slightly \nhigher PDIV compared with mineral oil which may be \nattributed to the less sludge formation of vegetable oils \neven after accelerated thermal agin g. It is also noticed that \npresence of copper during aging considerably reduced the \nPDIV . The reason may be that addition of copper to the oils \n \n \n \nFig. 4. Weibull distribution of breakdown voltage values of\nunaged oil samples at 2.5 mm gap distance o f \nelectrodes: (a) mineral oil; (b) corn oil; (c) palm oil\n \nFig. 5. Variations in scale parameter of oil samples at \ndifferent electrode gaps, where M, P and C stands \nfor mineal oil, palm oil and corn oil respectively. \nInvestigations on PD Characteristics of Thermal aged Palm and Corn Oil for Power Transformer Insulation Applications \n 1664\ncatalyses the oxidation process and hence aging of oils is \naccelerated [8].  \nOnce the PDIV is noted, then the test voltage was \nincreased until a clear PD patte rn of corona discharge is \nvisible. In the case of PRPD pattern analysis peak \ndischarge magnitude for each phase position window is \nplotted against the phase position. It investigates the PD \npatterns in relation to the 50Hz AC cycle [15-18].  \nMagnitude of PD pulses as well as their PRPD pattern \ncan give useful information about the state of deterioration \nof liquid insulation. Typical PD pattern obtained at needle-\nplane electrode configuration for virgin and 30 days \nthermal aged oils at a test voltage of 35 kV are shown in \nFig. 7. It is clear that PD activity under needle-plane \nconfiguration is more vigorous in the positive half cycle \nand it is initiated mostly in the positive half cycle. In the \nearlier works, it is reported that PD activity is more \nvigorous in the case of vegetable oils when compared with \nmineral oil [19-21]. Similar results are obtained in this \nwork. \nFig. 8 shows the PD pattern obtained at needle-plane \nconfiguration of 45 days thermal aged oil sample with and \nwithout copper at a test voltage of 35 kV . Significant \nincrease in PD activity is observed when compared with 30 \ndays aged oil specimen. In general, mineral oil shows low \nrepetition rate of PD activities than palm and corn oils for \nboth unaged and thermal aged conditions. It is noteworthy \nthat, according to [20, 21], the number of discrete PD \npulses per PD pulse burst of vegetable oils is higher \nwhen compared with minera l oil. However, the PD \n \nFig. 6.

Senthilkumar, B. Karthik and S. Chandrasekar \n 1665\nmagnitude of mineral oil is higher when compared with \nvegetable oils. Since the amplitude of PD signal mainly \ndepends on the voltage stress, it is important to understand \nthe PD characteristics with respect to increase in test \nvoltage for vegetable oils. Fig. 9 highlights the variations \nin PD amplitude and phase distortion with respect to \nincrease in test voltage of both vegetable oils and mineral \noil subjected to 30 days of thermal stress. In general, PD \nrepetition rate of vegetable oils is higher compared with \nmineral oil. Since the vegetabl e oils are more hygroscopic \nthan mineral oil, PD in vegetable oils propagate faster than \nmineral oil at the same voltage level and hence vegetable \noils exhibit higher PD repetition rates under AC stress [21]. \nIt is observed that in the case of mineral oil, the PD \namplitude increases from 50 mV to 500 mV with increase \nin voltage, whereas PD amplitude in both palm and corn oil \nincreases from 10 mV to 40 mV , which is very less when \ncompared with mineral oil. Initially, occurrence of PD at \nelectric field enhancement sites in oil increases the local \ntemperature, giving rise to the generation of fault gases \nsuch as ethane, hydrogen and acetylene. In earlier works, \nit is reported that generation rate of dissolved gases in \nvegetable oils is slightly lower than in mineral oils and \nvegetable oils are particularly stable under medium-\ntemperature thermal faults [19, 21]. This may be the cause \nfor the reduction in PD amplitude of vegetable oils. In the \ncase of mineral oil, for the same amount of voltage stress, \nPDs with higher amplitudes are more effective in breaking-\nup chemical bonds within liquid molecules and this may \nbe the cause for the production of large concentrations of \nfault gases. In general, PD dispersion increases with \nincrease in test voltage and it is considerably higher in the \ncase of mineral oil. It is also observed that increase in \napplied voltage leads to decr ease in PD phase inception \ndelay irrespective of type of oil. From these test results, it \nis observed that the performance of palm and corn oil is \nslightly better when compared with conventionally used \nmineral oils. \n \n4.2 PD pulse time & frequency domain analysis \n \nD.Imamovic et al., [20] have  analyzed the PD signal \ncharacteristics of mineral oils and vegetable oils in the time \nand frequency domains, which provide useful information \nabout the condition of the insulating oil.

From the frequency spectrum of \nthe PD pulses, it is clear that irrespective of the type of \naging, three peaks are noticed at 7, 20 and 33 MHz \nrespectively. Similar tests we re repeated for mineral oil \nand corn oil and it is noticed that there is no significant \ndifference in PD pulse characteristics at similar \nexperimental and aging conditions. \n \n4.3 Statistical analysis of PD pattern \n \nIn the case of real time outdoor PD measurements on \ntransformers, successful and accurate insulation condition \ndiagnosis based on PD analysis depends on the collection \nof statistical information on the PD signals. Reports on \nthe statistical information on the PD characteristics of \nvegetable oils are scanty. Hence, in the present work, \nanalysis of the stochastic features of PD-pulse sequences \nat needle-plane electrode configuration was carried out, \nwhich can be used as a parameter for understanding aging \ncondition of vegetable oil insulation.  \nTypical statistical quantities for PD pulse magnitude are \nskewness and mean value of the shape parameter (Beta) \nof the Weibull function [17-18]. Skewness is a most \ncommonly used parameter to check how the data are \ndistributed in the given range, whereas shape parameter is \nassociated with the dispersion of PD pulse height. PD \ninstrument software evaluates the shape parameter and \nskewness values of each PRPD pattern data and the \ncorresponding values were noted down for further analysis.  \nFig. 11 shows the mean values of shape parameter, \nobtained with 95 % confidence intervals from the PD \namplitude distribution, at different aging conditions of oils. \nThe corresponding minimum and the maximum values of \nthe same parameter obtained from the database are also \nreported. In this figure, VIR represents virgin oil, T1 \nrepresents 45 days thermal aged oil without copper and T2 \nrepresents 45 days thermal aged oil with copper. In general, \nas the aging severity increases, the reduction in β values is \nnoticed. Trend followed by β value clearly indicates the \nincrease in data dispersion with increase in aging severity. \nTest V oltage Oil 30 kV 35kV 40 kV \nMin \neral \n \n    FS=500 mV \n \n    FS=500 mV \n \n    FS=1000 mV \nPalm \n \n    FS=20 mV \n \n    FS=50 mV \n \n    FS=100 mV \nCorn \n \n    FS=150 mV \n \n    FS=50 mV \n \n    FS=100 mV \nFig. 9.

Chandrasekar \n 1667\nVegetable oils showed higher β value compared with \nmineral oil at all aging conditions. \nFig. 12 shows the minimum, maximum and mean \nvalues of skewness parameter, obtained with 95 percent \nconfidence intervals from the PD amplitude distribution, \nat different aging conditions. It is observed that with increase \nin aging severity, the value of skewness considerably \nincreases, which indicates th e reduction in symmetry of \nthe data at thermal aged conditions. In general, from the \nstatistical analysis of PD pattern, it is observed that \nvariation of shape parameter and skewness are closely \nrelated to the aging condition of the vegetable oils.  \nThe above reported PD characteristics of palm and corn \noil clearly show that they have the ability to be considered \nas an alternate for mineral oils. Since PD in liquid \ndielectrics generates from any stress enhancement sites, its \nreproducibility in discharge measurements is practically \ndifficult to achieve and hence it would be sensible to \noperate transformers below the PDIV level and thereby \nprevent possible molecular chain scission and chemical \ndegradation of vegetable oils in the presence of PD.  \nIt is reported in [22] that temperature changes may result \nin variation of PD properties and hence further research \nactivities are being carried out to understand the influence \nof elevated temperature on th e PD characteristics of these \nvegetable oils. Also, increase in viscosity of vegetable oils, \nas reported in many research papers, due to increase in \naging time is clearly not beneficial for high voltage \ntransformer applications. Hen ce further research work is \nbeing carried out to improve the viscosity property of \nvegetable oils under long term thermal stress.  \n \n \n5. Conclusion \n \nPartial discharge and breakdown strength experiments \nwere performed in the laboratory for both virgin and \nthermally aged palm and corn oils. Long term thermal \naging of palm and corn oil s lightly reduces the electrical \nbreakdown strength, however the BDV value lies above \nmineral oil. Partial discharge inception voltage of palm and \ncorn oil are higher than mine ral oil. Presence of copper \nduring aging process significan tly increased PD activities \nin mineral oil and vegetable oils. PD amplitude of palm oil \nand corn oil are lower than mineral oil with respect to \nincrease in applied voltage and also with respect to \nincrease in thermal stress aging period. Results show that \nthere is no considerable difference in terms of time domain \nand frequency domain charact eristics of PD signals for \nboth vegetable oils and mineral oil considered in this work. \nFrom the statistical analysis of PRPD pattern, skewness \nand shape parameter value considerably reduce with long \n \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \nFig. 10.
