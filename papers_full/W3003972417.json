Introduction \nResearch in conceptual metaphor theory has traditionally been based on researcher intuition to \nidentify whether or not an expression is used metaphorically or not. In the past decade, criteria \nfor metaphor identification has been standardized to a great de gree by relying on guidelines \n(Pragglejaz Group, 2007; Steen 2010) that are aided by dictionary entries so as to assist human \njudgement in verifying a potential metaphor in a given context. However, verifying what \nsource domain a metaphor belongs to is has  not been standardized the way metaphor \nidentification has. \n \nIn an overview of corpus-based approaches to metaphor analysis, Stefanowitsch (2006) \nnotes that previous scholars often begin their studies by selecting a potential source domain \n(i.e., a semantic domain or field that is known to play a role in metaphorical expressions), and \nthen searching for individual lexical items from this domain. These lexical items are mostly \nselected based on manual selection. For example, by investigating four terms under the domain \nof \nTEMPERATURE, Deignan (1999a, 1999b, 2006) exam ined the syntactic (e.g., the Part -of-\nSpeech of the lexical item), collocational and semantic (e.g., the semantic relation) patterning \nof linguistic metaphors, as well as the conceptual mapping between the source and target \ndomain. In other studies, the lexical items were selected based on the keyword analysis of texts \nbased on the topics under certain domain. For example, Partington (1998, 2003, 2006) \ngenerated the list of key items for the investigation of metaphors by conducting keyword \nanalysis of texts based on different target domain topics (e.g., political discourse). \n \nThese previous studies mainly focused on a limited collection of lexemes under a \ncertain source domain (either based on manual selection or keyword analysis). Therefore, \nStefanowitsch (2006) suggested building a corpus annotated with semantic fields/domains (i.e. \nthe source domain). He suggests that with this information annotated, we can specify a potential \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n4 \nsource domain and search directly for all lexical items belong to that source domain. However, \nwhat is first needed is a systematic methodology for verifying what source domain a \nmetaphorical keyword belongs to. He also pointed out that most studies categorize metaphors \nbased on more -or-less explicit common sensical intuitions of the part of the scholars. This \nstrategy may be problematic for cases that are not clear cut. An explicit source domain \nverification procedure can also help to alleviate these ambiguities.  \nOther approaches have been taken in Chinese to postulate the source dom ain between \nsource and target domain pairings of conceptual metaphors by using two major databases: \nWordNet (1.6) and SUMO nodes (Chung, Huang and Ahrens (2003), Ahrens, Chung and \nHuang (2004), Chung, Ahrens and Huang (2005), Chung and Ahrens (2006) , Huang, Chung \nand Ahrens (2007)).\n1 They used WordNet relations and SUMO definitions to identify the \nrelationships between metaphorical expressions and their corresponding ontological nodes. \nThis approach has been shown to effectively reduce the manual work requi red for the \nverification of the source domain. However, a systematic approach that is potentially replicable \nover a variety of source domains or languages has not been undertaken. Moreover, in this study, \ndue to the relatively large number of keywords, we found the identification of source domains \nusing WordNet or SUMO tools alone was not enough. For example, some infrequent lexical \nitems are not included in WordNet  and SUMO, e.g., 架构 jia4gou4 ‘structure’. Hence, \nadditional tools needed to be included to a more comprehensive methodology for source \ndomain verification, including collocation patterns (Gong, Ahrens and Huang (2008), Chung \n(2009), Chung and Huang (2010)), as well as the use of an online dictionary.  \n                                                 \n1 Shutova and Teufuel (2010) take a related  approach in English using a subset of categories from the Master \nMetaphor List (http://araw.mede.uic.edu/~alansz/metaphor/METAPHORLIST.pdf). \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n5 \nTherefore, in this paper we address the issue of source domain verification by proposing \na series of steps that can be used to check hypothesized source domains with the assistance of \ncorpus-linguistic tools: SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology), WordNet, an online \ndictionary and collocational patterns, along with a step-by-step procedure to utilize these tools. \nWe demonstrate that verifying source domains in this way allows for an easy -to-use and \nreplicable method of ascertaining whether a particular keyword belongs in a particular source \ndomain or not. We suggest that this method is a useful tool for particular types of metaphor \nanalyses with a number of commonly referenced source domains and may also be useful when \ndrawing contrastive analyses regarding how speakers from different groups or over di fferent \ntime periods have used a particular source domain so as to gain insight into their stance or \nideological viewpoint.  \n2. Source Domain Verification Procedure \nSource domain verification involves first identifying potential keywords and then ascertaining \nif they belong in a hypothesized source domain or not. This may be done before or after \nmetaphor identification occurs, as identifying potential metaphors is a separate procedure.\n2 \nBecause we are using a corpus that is three hundred thousand words, and because part of a \nfuture study is to see how political leaders use the \nBUILDING source domain in Hong Kong \nPolicy Addresses, for the purposes of the current study we will verify whether or not the \nkeywords are part of the \nBUILDING source domain prior to metaphor identification. Following \nthe work of Charteris -Black (2004), among others, generating the potential keyword list was \ncreated by reading  through a portion of the corpus careful ly and identifying possible \n                                                 \n2 One advantage to ascertaining source domains before identifying metaphors is that it is then possible to contrast \nwhat concepts are mapped to a target domain and which ones are not in a given corpus. This may vary for \ncorpora from different genre, such as medicine or politics. An advantage to ascertaining metaphors first is that \nthere will then be fewer examples to analyze, since literal instances will already be ruled out.  \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n6 \nmetaphorical keywords as potentially belonging in the source domain of BUILDING (建筑 \njian4zhu4 ‘building’).3   \nOnce we ascertained the keyword list, we then identified the language resources \navailable in Chinese that are potentially useful for source domain verification. We selected four \ndifferent language resources (1) Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (Niles and Peace, 2001) , \n(2) WordNet (1.6) (Miller, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998), (3) an online Chinese dictionary (Handian, \n2004), as well as (4) the Word Sketch Function in Sketch Engine  (Kilgarriff, Huang, Rychly \net al., 2005) and incorporated them into our decision-making process. In what follows we first \nexplain the resources that we used and then we outline the steps involved in the ve rification \nprocedure. \n2.1 Corpora-based resources utilized for source domain verification \nFirst, WordNet is a large-scale lexical knowledge base that was created at the Cognitive \nScience Laboratory of Princeton University in 1990, in which English nouns, verbs, and \nadjectives are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical concept \n(Fellbaum, 1998; Miller et al., 1990) . In addition, WordNet also functions as a semantic \nnetwork linking synsets with lexical semantic relations and is widely used in Natural Language \nProcessing applications and linguistic research (Huang, Chang and Lee, 2004).  \nSecond, SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology, http://ontology.teknowledge.com) \nis an upper ontology constructed by the IEEE Standard Upper Ontology Working Group and \nmaintained at Teknowledge Corporation. SUMO and its domain ontologies form the largest \nformal public ontology in existe nce today (Niles and Pease, 2003). As of February 2003, the \nontology contains more than 1000 terms and 4000 assertions. The purpose of SUMO is to be a \n                                                 \n3 If a previous researcher has postulated keywords to be in a particular source domain and these appear in the \ncorpus, these may also be included in the verification process.  \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n7 \nshared and inter -operable upper ontology (Niles and Pease 2001, Pease and Niles 2002, \nSevcenko 2003). Since ontologies are formalized descriptions of the structure of knowledge \nbases, SUMO can also be viewed as a proposed representation of shared human knowledge, \nand thus is a good candidate for providing mapping information about the source domain \n(Ahrens, Chung and Huang, 2003; Chung, Huang and Ahrens, 2003; Ahrens, Chung and \nHuang, 2003, 2004)).  \n            Both WordNet and SUMO were created for English; what we utilized in this study was \na tool which integrated these two language resources for Chinese, wh ich can be found at the \nAcademia Sinica Bilingual Ontological Wordnet (Sinica BOW —\nhttp://bow.ling.sinica.edu.tw/\n). Sinica BOW integrates WordNet, SUMO, and English-Chinese \nTranslation Equivalents Database (ECTED), functioning both as an English-Chinese bilingual \nWordnet and a bilingual lexical access to SUMO. 4 The goal of Sinica BOW is to give each \nlinguistic form a rigorous conceptual location, and to clarify the relation between conceptual \nclassification and linguistic instantiation, as well as to facilitate genuine cross -lingual access \nof knowledge (Huang et al., 2004). Sinica BOW allows versatile access and provides a \ncombination of lexical semantic, and ontological information in a 2x2x2 query design, eithe r \nin lexical lemmas or SUMO terms, and the query target can either be the WordNet content or \nthe SUMO ontology (Huang et al., 2004). For example, in a WordNet search, the return \nincludes an expandable list of the complete bilingual WordNet fields. The fields are listed under \neach sense and include: POS, synset, sense explanation, translation, and list of lexical semantic \nrelations. In addition, the domain information, translation equivalents, and link to the \n                                                 \n4 The three above resources were originally linked in two pairs: the English synsets in WordNet were mapped to \nChinese lexical equivalents by ECTED, and WordNet 1.6 was mapped to SUMO by Niles and Pease (2003). \nThus, WordNet synsets were a mediating link for the integration work (Huang et al., 2004).  \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n8 \ncorresponding SUMO node are also presented and le ad to the corresponding node in the \ndomain taxonomy of the ontology to allow further exploration (Huang et al., 2004).  \nIn order to verify the source domain of the keywords on our list, we first check the \nSUMO nodes of the keywords to ascertain whether the y are good candidates for knowledge \nrepresentation in the source domain. We then postulate the source domain of the keyword by \nchecking the categories and definitions of the metaphorical keywords provided in WordNet as \nfacilitated by the Sinica Bow interface, to see whether the most concrete meaning clearly aligns \nwith a postulated source domain based on its WordNet sense or explanation. The propose d \nprocedures will be tested and examples will be shown in detail in the following section.  \nMoreover, due to the relatively large number of keywords, we found the identification \nof source domains using WordNet or SUMO tools alone was not enough. For example, some \nlexical items are not included in WordNet and SUMO, e.g., 架构 jia4gou4 ‘structure’. In this \ncase, we m ay turn to a third option: the word sense provided by an online dictionary  may \nprovide information for source domain verification (i.e. if the word sense provided by \ndictionary aligns with a postulated source domain). We select a free online Chinese dictionary \nfor Chinese data —Handian (2004), which contains a number of authoritative Chinese \ndictionaries, including the Advanced Chinese Modern Dictionary (1996). \nLastly, we note the usefulness of another analysis (Gong, Ahrens and Huang, 2008) \nwhich proposes that the conceptual domain of a word may also be ascertained by examining \nits collocates to verify findings based on WordNet, SUMO or a dictionary sense, or when none \nof these options have provided a definitive answer.\n5 The tool to used here for collocations is \nthe Word Sketch function in Sketch Engine , which processes a word’s collocates and other \n                                                 \n5 Chung (2009) and Chung and Huang (2010) also have used collocational information when seeking to \ndetermine which source domains are related to a given target domain.  \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n9 \nwords in its surroundings. It summarizes the word’s grammatical and collocational behavior \nand is sorted with the most typical collocations at the top (Kilgarriff et al., 2010), showing the \nsearched word, its frequency, its collocates sorted into grammatical relations (e.g., objects, \nsubjects, modifiers), the frequency of each collocate, and typicality score ( Kilgarriff et al., \n2010).6 \n2.2 The source domain verification procedure \nThe source domain verification procedure is illustrated in Figure 1. Only one of the four \nconditions needs to be fulfilled to verify a source domain. \n The procedure runs as follows: After reading through the corpus and previous research \nto select keywords as postulated members of a  particular source domain, the criteria for a \nkeyword to be categorized in the source domain of BUILDING is determined.  This is done by \nexamining SUMO’s nodes and deciding which conceptua l nodes are related to the source \ndomain of BUILDING. We selected the classes of “Stationary Artifact”, “Building” and \n“Architecture”, including any one of their subclasses (e.g., “Entertainment building”, “Farm \nbuilding”, “Government building”, “Library building”, “Office building”, etc.). 7  For verbal \nkeywords, we decided that the class of ‘Constructing’ indicated that the keyword was in the \nsource domain of \nBUILDING.8 Thus, if a keyword has a conceptual node in any one of the above \nclasses, it is considered as part of the source domain of BUILDING. \nFigure 1. The source domain verification procedure \n \n                                                 \n6 Sketch Engine used a version of MI -Score modiﬁed to give greater weight to the frequency of the collocation. \nA very high score of the collocate means that there is little competition from other collocates because the node \n(i.e., the search word, the keyword) does not often combine with other collocates (Kilgarriff et al., 2014).  \n7 SUMO defines a ‘stationary artifact’ as: ‘an Artifact that has a fixed spatial location.’ ‘Class’ in upper ontology \nis defined as abstract group, set, or collection of objects. Most instances of this Class are architectural works, \ne.g. the Eiffel Tower, the Great Pyramids, office towers, single -family houses, etc. The words ‘fixed spatial \nlocation’ and  ‘Architectural works’ are terms that allow us to confirm the suggested source domain – \n‘\nBUILDING’.  \n8  For a full taxonomy of the class of Building in SUMO, please see: \nhttp://sigma.ontologyportal.org:8080/sigma/Browse.jsp?lang=EnglishLanguage&flang=SUO -\nKIF&kb=SUMO&term=Building. To view the entire taxonomy of SUMO, please see: \nhttp://www.adampease.org/OP/images/SUMOclasses.gif. \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n10 \n \n\n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n11 \nNext, if the SUMO nodes of the keyword do not clearly indicate the conceptual domain \nof the keyword belongs to BUILDING, we next try to verify the source domain by checking the \ncategories and definitions of the keywords provided in WordNet. By searching the definitions \nof a keyword in WordNet in Sinica Bow using the Chinese-English look-up search engine, we \nlocate a list of senses of the word (together with the explanation provided for the senses). The \nmost concrete sense can be identified from this list. If the most concrete sense meets one of the \nfollowing four conditions, we confirm the source domain as \nBUILDING.9  \n \n(1) Criteria for a keyword to be categorized in a particular source domain using WordNet, \ndictionary senses or collocates (using the source domain of BUILDING as an example) \na) The word sense and its explanation contain the word “building/house/architecture” \n(i.e., in Chinese this would be: 建筑物 / 楼房/ 房屋 / 房子 / 大厦/ 大楼  \njian4zhu4wu4/lou2fang2/fang2wu1/fang2zi0/da4sha4/da4lou2 ‘building’ , etc. ),  as \nwell as the subclasses of building including “office building”, “government building”, \n“residential building”, “high rise”, “factory building” etc.  \nb) The word sense and its explanation contain the word which refers to the components \nof a building, e.g., “balcony”, “pillar”10 \nc) The word sense and its explanation contain the word which refers to different kinds \nof building (constructional engineering), including “bridge”, “speedway” etc. \n                                                 \n9 These criteria will need to be developed independently for each source domain analyzed, with the understanding \nthat identifying and then using these criteria allow for others to have a framework to verify these decisions, \ninstead of relying solely on intuition alone. \n10 We included criteria b) and c) as they are similar to what can be found under the conceptual domain of \n‘stationary artifact’ in SUMO. \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n12 \nd) The word sense and its explanation contain the word which refers to the act of \nbuilding, e.g., “to build”.11  \n \nNext, if neither WordNet nor SUMO contain enough information to decide, an on- line \ndictionary is referenced to check whether the word sense provided by the dictionary meets one \nof the four conditions shown above. \nIf WordNet, SUMO and the dictionary do not provide clear evidence of a semantic \nrelationship between the metaphorical keyword and the hypothesized source domain (e.g., \nBUILDING), collocation searches for the keywords may be run using Chinese Sketch Engine \n(Kilgarriff, Huang, Rychly et al., 2005). We search for collocates of the keyword to check if \nBUILDING-related words fou nd in the senses listed in (1) are frequently collocated with the \npotential keyword by using Chinese Sketch Engine. 12 In order to determine the cut-off point \nfor collocating frequency, we use the notion of high saliency values. According to Chung and \nHuang (2010), the saliency values of the collocates may be separated into significant collocates \nand non-significant collocates using methods proposed in Chung et al. (2007), whereby a cut-\noff point for the significant collocates may  be determined in terms of several different \ncalculations. We follow the calculation of the ‘mean of means’, which is a threshold value that \nis computed based on the mean of a group of means of saliency values (cf. Chung, 2007, 2009; \n                                                 \n11 We included criteria b) and c) as they are similar to what can be found under the conceptual domain of \n‘Constructing’ in SUMO. \n12 Chinese Sketch Engine is based on the Chinese Gigaword Corpus, which can be found at \nhttp://wordsketch.ling.sinica.edu.tw/. Registration is required to access Chinese Sketch Engine.  \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n13 \nChung and Huang, 2010) .13 An example showing how the cut -off point is calculated will be \nexplained in Section 3. \nLastly, if neither the SUMO nodes, the WordNet senses and explanations, the word \nsenses in dictionary nor the syntactic collocation has indicated that the word is sem antically \nrelated to the suggested source domain, then we exclude this potential keyword from the source \ndomain category. \n3.0 Testing the Source Domain Verification Procedure using Hong Kong Chief \nExecutives’ Corpus \nIn this section, we run the proposed procedure on a set of Chinese keywords hypothesized to \nbe part of the source domain of BUILDING and found in a small political corpus.14  \n3.1 Corpus \nThe corpus utilized for this study  is the Hong Kong Chief Executives Corpus (1997-2014), \nwhich is one of the sub- corpora of the HKBU Corpus of Political Speeches  \n(http://digital.lib.hkbu.edu.hk/corpus/index.php) (Ahrens, 2015) . The Hong Kong Chief \nExecutives corpus is comprised of Hong Kong Policy Address delivered annually by Chief \nExecutive of the H ong Kong Special Administrative Region to the Hong Kong Legislative \nCouncil.15 The address includes a summary of the past work of the Hong Kong government \nand an introduction of its policy in the coming year. This report is released through various \n                                                 \n13 The formula for mean of means is shown below. \n1\n),,() , ( ) () 1 () 2 (211\n−\n+ … + −−\nn\nSaliencySaliencySaliencyMeanSaliencySaliencymean nnnn  \n14 Note that utilizing a specific corpus allows the researcher to read through a portion of the text and identify \npotential keywords specific to that corpus that may be missed if solely relying on intuition or previous work.  \n15 In Chinese this report is known as 施政报告.  \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n14 \nmedia outlets and m ost people see it as a useful way of predicting what the Hong Kong \npoliticians will focus on in the coming year. There are three  speakers involved in this corpus: \nTung Chee-hwa, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, and Leung Chung-ying. All speeches were written \nin both English and Chinese. As the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the usefulness of the \nsource domain verification procedure, we will focus on the Chinese version of Hong Kong \nPolicy Addresses.

There were four keywords that clearly aligned with a postulated \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n16 \nsource domain (i.e. BUILDING) based on their SUMO nodes of ‘Stationary artifact,’ ‘Building,’ \nand ‘Constructing’ as discussed above: 底层 di3ceng2, 楼 lou2 ‘building’, 强化 qiang2hua4 \n‘strengthen’ and 加强 jia1qiang2 ‘strengthen’ (Table 3). Hence, these four keywords may be \nascertained to be part of the source domain of BUILDING.   \n \nTable 3. SUMO nodes for BUILDING metaphorical keywords \nMetaphorical Keyword SUMO nodes \n底层 di3ceng2 ‘ground floor’ Stationary artifact \n(固定人造物) \n楼 lou2 ‘building’ Building (建筑物) \n强化 qiang2hua4 ‘strengthen’ Constructing (建筑) \n加强  jia1qiang2 ‘strengthen’ Constructing (建筑) \n  \n3.4 Checking WordNet Senses \nNext, for the remaining 35 keywords on our list, the categories and definitions of the \nkeywords provided in WordNet were also checked. In this step, a total of eleven  words were \nconfirmed to be in the BUILDING domain, including 基层 ji1ceng2 ‘base’, 层 ceng2 ‘floor’, 建\n立 jian4li4 ‘build’ , 基础 ji1chu3 ‘foundation’ , 基石 ji1shi2 ‘cornerstone’, 平台 ping2tai2 \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n17 \n‘platform’, 扩展 kuo4zhan3 ‘expand’, 缔造 di4zao4 ‘build’, 建设 jian4she4 ‘build’, 奠基 \ndian4ji1 ‘lay the foundation’, 工程 gong1cheng2 ‘(constructional) engineering’.  \nFor example, for the keyword 基石 ji1shi2 ‘cornerstone’ was found to be ‘ Artifact’ \nwhen we checked its SUMO node (column 4 in Table 4), which is superordinate to ‘stationary \nartifact’, and thus less specific. Thus, we needed to move to the next step and check its \nWordNet sense. B y searching the definitions of 基石 ji1shi2 ‘cornerstone’ in WordNet in \nSinica Bow using the Chinese-English look-up search engine, we located a list of senses of the \nword. The most concrete sense (i.e., the more concrete meaning that was mapped from the \nsource domain) was identified from the list. In this case, the  sense ‘cornerstone’ (column 2 in \nTable 4) was selected as the most concrete sense  and ‘BUILDING’ is chosen as the suggested \nsource domain for 基石 ji1shi2 ‘cornerstone’, based on the explanation provided for the sense \n(column 3 in Table 4).   \n \nTable 4. WordNet-SUMO definition of 基石 ji1shi2 ‘cornerstone’ \nMetaphorical Keyword WordNet Sense Explanations SUMO nodes \n基石 ji1shi2 ‘cornerstone’ cornerstone a stone laid at a \nceremony to mark the \nfounding of a new \nbuilding \nArtifact \n(人造物) \n \n \n \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n18 \n 3.5 Checking Dictionary Senses \nFor the remaining 24 keywords, neither WordNet nor SUMO contained enough \ninformation to reach a decision. In those cases, the Handian online Chinese Dictionary was  \nreferenced (https://www.zdic.net/) . For instance, for the keyword 支持 zhi1chi2 ‘support’, \nWordNet-SUMO does not provide specific evidence about which source domain it relates to, \nas shown in Table 5, where the SUMO node given is ‘Process.’ \nTable 5. WordNet-SUMO search of 支持 zhi1chi2 ‘support’ \nMetaphorical Keyword WordNet Sense Explanation SUMO nodes \n支持 zhi1chi2 ‘support’ support supply the force or \npower for the \nfunctioning of \n \nProcess \n \nWe then checked the word senses provided in the Handian online Chinese dictionary, where \n支持 zhi1chi2 ‘support’ is defined as 支撑, 撑住, 例如支持阳台的柱子 ‘to support, such as \nthe pillars to support the balcony ’ (as shown in point 1 of Figure 2). Since the word ‘ pillars’ \nand ‘balcony’ are included in the definition, as noted a priori  in 1( b), we conclude that \nBUILDING is the source domain for 支持 zhi1chi2 ‘support’.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n19 \nFigure 2. Word Senses in Handian Online Dictionary \n支持 zhi1chi2 ‘support’ \n(1) [to support]: 支撑;撑住 ‘to support’, e.g., 支持阳台的柱子 ‘pillars to \nsupport the balcony’; \n(2) [sustain]: 勉强维持 ‘barely maintain’; \n(3) [deal with]: 应付;打点 ‘to deal with’;  \n(4) [supply]: 供应 ‘to supply’, e.g., 支持一路舟车之费 ‘provide travel \nexpenses’;  \n(5) [take in charge of]: 把持;主持 ‘take in charge of’;  \n(6) [assist]: 支援;赞同鼓励 ‘to support’, e.g., 彼此支持 ‘support each \nother’. \n \nThe word sense in Handian provides evidence for in total 8 words, including 框架 \nkuang1jia4 ‘frame’, 架构 jia4gou4 ‘structure’, 拓宽 tuo4kuan1 ‘broaden’, 封顶 feng1ding3 \n‘seal roof’, 牢固 lao2gu4 ‘solid’, 结构 jie2gou4 ‘structure’, 巩固 gong3gu4 ‘strengthen’ and \n支持 zhi1chi2 ‘support’, which allow us to confirm their proposed source domain as BUILDING. \n \n3.6 Checking Collocational Patterns \nFor the remaining 16 words, neither Wordnet, SUMO or Handian provide clear \nevidence of a semantic relationship between the metaphorical keyword and the hypothesized \nsource domain (i.e. \nBUILDING), so collocation searches for the keywords are run using Chinese \nSketch Engine (Kilgarriff, Huang, Rychly et al., 2005) in order to verify the suggested source \ndomain BUILDING. Three keywords are confirmed as being under BUILDING metaphor in this \nstep are 支柱 zhi1zhu4 ‘pillar’, 建构 jian4gou4 ‘construct’  and 稳定 wen3ding4 ‘stable’.  \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n20 \nWe take 支柱  zhi1zhu4 ‘pillar’ as an example. We u sed Chinese Sketch Engine to \nsearch for collocates of 支柱 zhi1zhu4 ‘pillar’ to see if it frequently co -occurs with 建筑  \njian4zhu4 ‘building’. Figure 3 shows the collocates of 支柱 zhi1zhu4 ‘pillar’ in terms of  \nvarious grammatical relations to the keyword. The f irst column in the figure includes all the \ncollocates, the second column is the frequency of the collocates, and the third column is the \nsaliency value for that collocation pair. As we mentioned in Section 2, we ascertained the cut-\noff points (i.e. mean of means) for each grammatical relation to find the significant collocates \nfor each keyword. For example, for the saliency list below in Figure 3, the first mean is the \nmean of the saliency values of the first  (4.36) and the second collocates (4.29); and the second \nmean is the mean of saliency values of the first three collocates: collocate one (4.36), two (4.29), \nand three (3.62), i.e., we add a new collocate each time. When all means have been calculated \nfor all collocates, an overall mean is obtained from all these means (this is the ‘mean of means’). \nIn this case, the threshold value for the possessors of 支柱 zhi1zhu4 is 2.716, and for the noun \nmodifiers of 支柱 zhi1zhu4 is 4.633. As we can see from the figure, among the significant \ncollocates of 支柱 zhi1zhu4, there is a BUILDING related word 骑楼 qi2lou2 ‘arcade building’ \nwhich shows a saliency value of 6.63, which is greater than 4.633. Following the criteria set \nup in (1a) above along with the criteria for high saliency, we can conclude indicating that 建\n筑 jian4zhu4 ‘building’ is one of the top collocations of the keyword 支柱 zhi1zhu4 ‘pillar’. \n \n \n \n  \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n21 \nFigure 3.

There were 13 keywords selected by the annotator as a potential me taphorical \nkeyword related to BUILDING based on expert’s intuition. However, neither the WordNet senses \nand explanations, the SUMO nodes, the word senses in dictionary, nor the syntactic collocation \nindicated the word is semantically related to BUILDING. Two of them were very abstract and \ncannot be asserted as under any metaphorical source domain: 缓冲 huan3chong1 ‘buffer’, and\n平衡 ping2heng2 ‘balance’. There were 11 keywords that may potentially belong to other \nsource domains, including SPACE (e.g., 中心 zhong1xin1 ‘center’, 空间 kong1jian1 ‘space’, \n扩充 kuo4chong1 ‘extend’, 扩张 kuo4zhang1 ‘expand’, 扩大 kuo4da4 ‘enlarge’, and 扩展  \nkuo4zhan3 ‘expand’), GAME (e.g., 布局 bu4ju2 ‘layout’), MACHINE (e.g., 调整 tiao2zheng3 \n‘adjust’), EARTH (e.g., 板块 ban3kuai4 ‘board’) and BODY (e.g., 中枢 zhong1shu1 ‘pivot’).  \n3.8 Discussion \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n22 \nIn conclusion, after two linguists worked through the source domain verification \nprocedure for the 39 potential keywords, 26 of them were found to have evidence for being \nassociated with the source domain of BUILDING (Table 6).  Among these 26 keywords, 4 \ndecisions were based on the SUMO nodes and definitions, 11 decisions were based on the \nWordNet sense and explanations, 8 were based on definitions in the on- line dictionary, and 3 \ndecision were based on collo cation evidence (the shaded cells indicate at what step each \ndecision was made).  In addition, we can see from Table 6 that all four options were needed in \norder to ensure robust coverage for inclusion in this source domain, as ruling out any given \nstep wo uld result in the exclusion of some keywords as other steps would not necessarily \nprovide the needed information.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n23 \nTable 6.

Conclusion \nIn this paper we proposed a method to verify which postulated keywords may be categorized \nwithin the source domain of \nBUILDING with the assistance of four corpus -based resources: \nSUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology), WordNet, collocational patterns and an online \ndictionary. This method has the advantage of providing both flexibility and accountability to \nresearchers working in various aspects of metaphor theory as it provides guidelines for how \nto undertake source domain determination and can be specified in a paper’s methods. The \nspecification would need to state the SUMO classes and sub -classes that were considered to \nbe associated with this source domain as well as the lexical items that appear in the WordNet \nor dictionary senses that indicate association with this source domain, as in (1) above. The \nflexibility comes from the ability for researchers to make different choices regarding the \nSUMO classes, sub -classes, or the lexical items in WordNet or a dictionary that indicate \nassociation with the source domain. The accountability comes from being able to report this \ninformation clearly so that other researchers could replicate the analysis or question why \ncertain choices were made and offer alternate specifications.  \nIn addition to using this method to analyze source domains, this process  may also be \nused when identifying target domains. For example, a target word concept, such as ‘economy’ \nmay be searched in a corpus and then potential metaphor identification could occur, using either \nMIP ( Pragglejaz Group, 2007) or MIPVU (Steen, 2010). If ‘economy’ has been used \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n25 \nmetaphorically, the word or phrase in the sentence may then be identified as a potential \nkeyword for a given source domain, after which the source domain verification process could \noccur. Furthermore, it could be explored as to whether SUMO may aid in metaphor \nidentification, as its ontology classifies each sense of a word as either an entity that is either \n‘physical’ or ‘abstract’ allowing for a researcher to ascertain that a word has a more concrete \nsense. Using SUMO may also help researchers in clarifying the levels of metaphor question \nthat Kovesces raises in his (2017) paper. His proposal is that that there are four levels of \nschematicity, with images schemas as the most schematic, followed by domains, frames, and \nthen mental spaces (which is the least schematic).  \nBUILDING is a domain in this system and \nframes further elaborate aspects of those domains. It remains to be seen if the ontological \nstructure of SU MO aids not only in source domain identification, but also may help with \nelaborating aspects of the frames within each domain. \n \n Moreover, simply looking at source domains has potential implications as well, as this \nline of research may contrast  the use of the source domains across genres or gender or time \nperiods (i.e., comparing the British-appointed Hong Kong Governors use of a particular source \ndomain from 1984 to 1996 with the Hong Kong Chief Executives who led Hong Kong after \nBritish Colonial rule ended in 1997). In addition, with this procedure and the bilingual tools \navailable, it is also possible to contrast what source domains are used in the English versions \nof the Policy Addresses with the Chinese versions of the Policy Addresses.\n16 \nOf course, further work is needed to ascertain if this type of ontologically-based source \ndomain verification works well for some source domains, such as BUILDING, or JOURNEY, but \n                                                 \n16 In addition to the bilingual tools used in this study, language generation templates for SUMO in Hindi, Italian, \nGerman and Czech can be found here: http://www.adampease.org/OP/. Information on Wordnets in other \nlanguages can be found here: http://globalwordnet.org/resources/wordnets-in-the-world/ and information on \nhow to use SketchEngine in over ninety languages can be found here: https://www.sketchengine.eu/corpora-\nand-languages/.  \n      \nSOURCE DOMAIN VERIFICATION   \n \n26 \nnot others, such as LIGHT/DARKNESS. Further research utilizing SUMO, WordNet and \nassociated corpus-based information, including collocations, will give a clearer understanding \nas to which source domains are amenable to this particular type of analysis. In addition, it may \nbe the case that collocations (or SUMO or WordNet or dictionar y definitions) are especially \nuseful for verifying particular source domains.  \nIn sum, the source domain verification procedure is a new set of procedures that \nprovides researchers with a principled, yet flexible, set of guidelines with which to determine \nif a postulated word belongs in a particular source domain. The analysis involves ascertaining \nthe criteria to be followed using corpus -based tools and then checking these criteria for each \nword that is postulated to be in that source domain, allowing for greater research validity and \nreplicability in metaphor studies. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe first author would like to thank the University Grants Council of Hong Kong for supporting \nthis research (General Research Fund # 12400014 ).
