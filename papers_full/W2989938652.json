One such hazard is the\npotential for generation of bubbles from the solid (cellulosic)\ninsulation [3], normally as an aggressive form of moisture\ndesorption. Failure can be difﬁcult to ascribe directly to the\nformation of bubbles, but there are several cases where this\nhas been credited as the cause, according to [4].\nFurther, both IEC and IEEE recognize that bubbling of\nmoisture within transformers can be caused by high tempera-\ntures [2], [5], and they allow for calculation of the temperature\nat which bubbles might form, given certain conditions. This is\nknown as the bubble inception temperature (BIT). Note that\nin [2] this formula is prescribed as normative, whereas in [5]\nthe calculation is provided only as informative.

This\nis the formula (with an additional term used to account for\nconditions of extreme high gas content) generally adopted for\nuse. An alternative formula proposed by [9] which was based\non the exponential decay in BIT ( ϑ) with increasing moisture\ncontent in paper ( W ) is shown in (2). This reﬂects the trend\nof the decrease in enthalpy required to desorb moisture from\nthe cellulosic insulation as moisture content increases.\nϑ =αe−βW (2)\nA decay in bond strength as more of the adsorbent surface\nbecomes occupied is also the basis of (1) (described later\nfor the Freundlich isotherm) [10], such that both of these\npotential BIT formulae share a common theoretical base.\nThese two formulae are examined herein and their ability to\nﬁt easily onto other available data is tested.\nThere are many other factors which are inﬂuential to\nBIT, including: moisture content / relative saturation of solid\ninsulation; solid insulation material selection; liquid insula-\ntion material selection; transformer loading history / behav-\nior; and insulation aging condition. A detailed discussion\non these factors is available in [11]. Development of BIT\nformulae to account for the variety of transformer insulation\nconditions is a necessity, and this paper aims to formulate the\ndependence of BIT on the aging condition of solid insulation,\nand to investigate potential further improvements based on\nthe available BIT data.\nII. BACKGROUND TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF BUBBLE\nINCEPTION FORMULAE CURRENTLY IN USE\nA. SORPTION ISOTHERM FORMULA\nSorption isotherms show how a material (the ‘sorbate’) is\ndistributed between the solid (‘sorbent’) and the surround-\ning ﬂuid (‘solution’). The isotherm relates the amount of\n‘adsorption sites’ of the sorbent which are ‘occupied’ by\nadsorbed material to the partial pressure of the sorbate in the\nsolution. In the case of a transformer, the paper insulation\nis the sorbent, the solution is the insulating ﬂuid (normally\nmineral oil), and the sorbate considered in this discussion is\nmoisture (i.e., molecules of H 2O).\nIt is believed that modeling of moisture bubbling behavior\ncan be done by using the sorption isotherm behavior to deter-\nmine the temperature at which moisture will leave the paper\n[6]. Therefore, it is important to understand the dynamics of\nmoisture sorption in order to select the correct isotherm for\nthis scenario.\n1) SELECTION OF ISOTHERM FOR CELLUOSE AND\nMOISTURE SYSTEMS\nIt is generally considered that there are six types of isotherm,\nwith Type I being the most simplistic, and complexity increas-\ning up to Type VI [12]. In [13], moisture-cellulose sorp-\ntion behavior was shown to be Type II. It also showed that\nthe isotherm can be approximated reasonably well by ﬁtted\nmodels such as the Langmuir model (at low moisture con-\ntent, <2%), the Freundlich model (at low-to-medium mois-\nture content, <4%), and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)\nmodel (also at low-to-medium moisture content, <4%, but\nwith a better approximation of shape throughout the full\nmoisture range than the Freundlich equation). In [6] the\nFreundlich model, adopting the values from [8], was used.\nAs moisture content in paper greater than 4-5% is unlikely\nwithin most operational transformers, thus the Freundlich and\nBET models should sufﬁce in those applications. It is of\ndue consideration that commentary provided in [13] states\nthat construction of isotherms below 2% moisture lacks\nreliability.\nThe basic equation for the Freundlich equation is described\nin (3),\nW =Kp\n1\nn (3)\nIn (3), n is an empirical constant with a value always greater\nthan 1 which describes the absorption topology of the sorbent\n171674 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. P. Hillet al.: Improvements to the Construction of Bubble Inception Formulae for Use With Transformer Insulation\nFIGURE 1. Cellulose monomer with 2-, 3- and 6- OH groups identified.\nFIGURE 2. Indicative Type II isotherm (sigmoid isotherm) with key\nsections (marked x, y, z) identified.\n(paper in this case). Some texts use f in place of 1/ n for\nsimplicity.\n2) DESCRIPTION OF ISOTHERM PARAMETERS\nSurface morphology inﬂuences adsorption behavior [14].\nIn reality, the value of n describes how uniform the absorbing\nsites on a surface are; a higher value of n indicates a less\nuniform surface for bonding. Surface uniformity refers to how\nsimilar the sites for adsorption are, usually in terms of afﬁnity\nand / or availability of the sites to the sorbate. It is seen in\n(3) that a greater value of n reduces the amount of adsorption\nthat takes place implying that n =1 describes the ‘ideal’ case\nwhere all potential adsorption sites match.\nIn cellulose, there are three potential sites for adsorption\nof H2O molecules, the hydroxyl (OH) bonds at the 2-, 3- and\n6- positions on the glucose ring, as shown in Figure 1.\nAs remarked above, a Type II isotherm is witnessed during\nadsorption of moisture by cellulose. The Type II isotherm\ncan be broken down into three sections, marked as x, y, z,\nin Figure 2. The initial part of the curve for low moisture\ncontent (section x) rises steeply and terminates in a ‘knuckle\npoint’ which is usually taken to indicate the saturation of\nmono-molecular adsorption to the OH bonds on the glu-\ncose ring. Beyond this point (section y), the moisture is\nassumed to form multiple layers of moisture bonded to the\npreviously adsorbed moisture molecules of the mono-layer\n[9], [15], [16]. This part of the isotherm again terminates in\na knuckle point (of the inverse inﬂection), where the ﬁnal\nsection starts (section z). This ﬁnal section is thought to\ndescribe the swelling of cellulose, at which point the adsorp-\ntion of moisture occurs more as a physical than chemical\nadsorption process, with moisture held in the capillaries of\nthe cellulose. This point is expected to be some way beyond\nthe normal operating moisture content of transformers. The\nvalue of n in (3) explains the difference between mono-layer\nadsorption and poly-layer adsorption.\nAlternatively, compelling evidence from [17] suggested\nthat the initial uptake of moisture (section x) occurs prefer-\nentially on the OH at position 6- of the cellulose monomer\nglucose ring (as seen in Figure 1) and this saturates at the ﬁrst\nknuckle point, with positions 2- and 3- hydrating thereafter\nin section y. In this case, n is describing the difference in\nadsorption afﬁnity among sites rather than layers.\nThe constant K from (3) can be further detailed by (4).\nK =Ae\nB\nτ (4)\nIt is clear to see that K depends on τ from (4). This form\nof K appears much like a reaction constant, and so it is\ntempting to relate A to the frequency of collisions, and B as a\nspeciﬁc energy value (energy of adsorption divided by either\nthe universal gas constant or Boltzmann constant).\nSubstituting with this expanded form of K, (3)\nbecomes (5). Rearrangement for temperature allows for cal-\nculation of the isotherm temperature for known conditions\nof p and W . This is how the formula is currently used to\ncalculate BIT (with the BIT, ϑ, assumed equal to the isotherm\ntemperature, τ, as in (1)).\nW =Ae\nB\nτ p\n1\nn (5)\nA ﬁnal notable feature of sorption phenomena is that\nthere is hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption\nprocesses. Therefore, one would expect different answers if\ndesorption or adsorption isotherms were used, and as bubbles\nare a desorptive process it is not appropriate to use adsorption\ndata to represent bubbling. The hysteresis is a feature of the\nthermodynamically irreversible sorption process [16] (mois-\nture can be desorbed after adsorption, or vice-versa, but work\nmust be done to the system to enable this change). Caution\nshould thus be exercised when using isotherm data [13].\n3) ERRORS IN FORMULA (1)\nThe ﬁrst adjustment that should be made is to correct for some\nerrors in the constants in (1). A mathematical mistake was\nfound in [8], reported by [18]. However (1) with incorrect\nconstants is still used in the latest standards [2], [5]. The\nimpact of this ﬁnding on BIT prediction is discussed in [19].\nThe formula with the correct constants is shown in (6).\nϑ = 7064.8\n22.95 +1.4959 ln W −ln p (6)\nThese changes to the constants cause the estimation\nof BIT to reduce, the isotherm now under-predicts rather\nVOLUME 7, 2019 171675\nJ.

Solid insu-\nlation of different studies and used in different transformers\nmay have different values to those of the original studies.\nThe values of n and B used from [8] are based on a number\nof studies, and a range of values is actually shown in that\npublication. Table 3 shows the effect of variation of the values\nchosen for n and B.\nData available for new NTUP and new mineral oil in [9]\nalso allows for ﬁtting of (7), with n and nB as per Table 2. This\ngives nln(1/A) of 22.915. This value of nln(1/A) is similar to\nthat of (6).\nB. SORPTION ENTHALPY FORMULA\nWhere the sorption isotherm method gives an indication of\npaper moisture content at given conditions and shows the\ndirection of sorption for system perturbations, the enthalpy\nof sorption expresses the strength of the adsorptive bond\nbetween moisture and cellulose [22]. This bond strength\nvaries depending on the location of the bond – i.e., the layer\nor position of the bond within the sorbent material structure.\nOnce the cellulose is saturated, moisture can no longer\nbond to the cellulose, becoming free water. At this point the\nenthalpy required to desorb / adsorb moisture is equal to\nthe vaporization of pure water as no adsorptive bonding is\ninvolved to increase the energy requirements [23]. Thereby,\nfor sufﬁciently high moisture content of cellulose, any for-\nmula used to calculate the enthalpy of adsorption must allow\nthis criterion to be met, or must at least approach it asymp-\ntotically. One such function is that of exponential decay.\nA method of calculating the molar enthalpy of vaporization\nis shown in (8), as was ﬁrst proposed by Riedel [23], [24].\nQs =ce−βW +Lr (8)\nEquation (8) shows that greater amounts of energy are\nneeded in order to desorb moisture from the cellulose as\nits moisture content reduces. In fact, the construction of (8)\ncomes from a relationship between water activity and temper-\nature, which was then converted into an energy value by use\nof the universal gas constant, such that (8) could be re-written\nas (9),\nQs =Rmαe−βW +Lr (9)\nIn research relevant to transformers, in [9] the authors\nproposed an empirical formula of this form (equation (2)) to\nﬁt the experimental data, changing the parameters αand βfor\nthe different materials (including thermally upgraded paper\n(TUP)) and material conditions that were tested. Relating this\nformula to the sorption enthalpy gives a theoretical basis for\nits construction. A modiﬁcation should be made however. The\nauthors originally ﬁt the data of temperature to the exponen-\ntial decay function in degrees Celsius. Instead, this should be\ndone for the absolute temperatures, i.e., in Kelvin.\nA comparison of the parameters of (2) from the original\n(Celsius) ﬁtting and for reﬁtting with the absolute tempera-\ntures (Kelvin) for various conditions and types of paper and\noil is shown in Table 4.\nTaking the new NTUP and new oil condition, the αvalue\nis seen to be approximately consistent (a difference of around\n270 is similar to the conversion from Celsius to Kelvin). How-\never, there is a signiﬁcant difference in the decay constant, β.\nInterestingly though, the ratio between β for new paper and\noil and β for aged paper and oil is similar at around 1.6\nirrespective of the temperature basis, suggesting that the same\ncomparative impact is maintained when insulation ages.\nIII. VARIATION WITH INSULATION AGING\nA. SORPTION ISOTHERM FORMULA\nAn assessment of the variation of moisture equilibrium with\ninsulation aging condition was done in [25], considering des-\norption isotherms at temperatures much lower than those at\nwhich bubbles form. In the speciﬁc application of isotherms\nfor moisture equilibrium modelling, A was found to depend\non degree of polymerization (DP) of the paper insulation.\n171676 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. P. Hillet al.: Improvements to the Construction of Bubble Inception Formulae for Use With Transformer Insulation\nTABLE 4. α and β values for various data sets, materials, and material conditions (dashed line separates relative and absolute temperature fittings).\nThus, if the isotherm equation is applied to BIT, the same\nphenomenon should be observed.\nResults in [20] showed that the aging condition of the paper\ninsulation, deﬁned by its DP value, affects the BIT. New\nparameters were ﬁtted to (1) (excluding its second term as\nthe system was gas free) for the new paper data in order to\nﬁnd the n and B values applicable to the speciﬁc paper used\nin the study. This ﬁtting for BIT of new paper (DP =1357)\nfrom [20] is shown in (10).\nϑ = 10880\n30.544 +3.156 ln W −ln p (10)\nThis gives n =3.156 and B =3447.4. The n value is much\nhigher than from [8], the B value is lower, but within a similar\nrange as [8].\nAs BIT calculated by (1) is not already a function of\nDP, new parameters were ﬁtted to (1) for the aged paper\nin [20]. This ﬁtting for BIT of aged paper (DP =341)\nfrom [20] is shown in (11). Note that from plotting of the\ncurve, the nln(1/A) term appears to have been misreported\nand the formula should actually appear as (12). It is also noted\nthat the formula is originally presented with a plus sign before\nthe pressure term, but this would violate the rearrangement\n(per rearrangement of (5) to (6), and the physical reality that\nincreased pressure should increase BIT).\nConsidering (10) and (12), there does not appear to be a\nspeciﬁc trend in the parameters found from the curve ﬁtting\nand the DP value of the samples.\nϑ = 16210000\n3.747 +4497 ln W +ln p (11)\nϑ = 16210000\n37470 +4497 ln W −ln p (12)\nVOLUME 7, 2019 171677\nJ. P. Hillet al.: Improvements to the Construction of Bubble Inception Formulae for Use With Transformer Insulation\nFIGURE 3. Flow chart describing the reduction in A with aging, and its\neffect on BIT.\nRecalling that n is a value that is speciﬁc to the adsorption\nbond uniformity, and it is assumed that aging through hydrol-\nysis (the main aging mechanism) has little to no inﬂuence on\neither the ratio between 2-, 3- and 6- located OH on cellulose\nmonomers, nor the ability of mono-layers and poly-layers to\nform, it seems sensible to suggest that the value of n should\nremain unchanged as the cellulose ages.\nEqually, because the bonds formed are the same\n(OH - H2O), the energy of the formation should be unaffected\nby the aging process (especially if the inﬂuence of other aging\nby-products is discounted), so the value of B should remain\nconstant as well.\nThis leaves only A able to vary with aging. In (4), A is\na pre-exponential factor for the rate constant, K, which can\nbe described as showing ‘the number of effective collisions\nper second’, where ‘effective’ requires the collision to occur\n‘in the correct orientation’ [29] and with sufﬁcient energy to\nreact [30].\nWhen cellulose ages, its amorphous region is attacked\nﬁrst [14], [31], [32] and this is the form of cellulose which\nholds moisture most easily [17], [24]. Indeed, several studies\nhave shown that aged paper is capable of holding less mois-\nture than unaged paper [15], [20], [33]–[35]. The proportions\nof amorphous and crystalline regions deﬁne the crystallinity\nindex (CI), with higher crystalline prevalence giving a\nhigher CI.\nIf the amorphous region is depleted, resulting in a reduced\naccessibility of sites, it is reasonable to assume that the value\nof A is also affected, as the frequency of effective collisions\nis impacted. Smaller values of A in (7) result in lower BIT\nwhich is the expected outcome for bubbling in aged paper\ninsulation [20]. This process is depicted by the ﬂow chart in\nFigure 3.\nTherefore, (7) is used to reﬁt the data from [20] to\nimprove (12), with n and B held constant from (10). This is\npresented in (13), showing that the A value has decreased in\nthe aged paper. Figure 4 shows the original ﬁtting of (12)\ncompared to (13).

Therefore, an exponential ﬁtting of decay of A with\n1/DP was used, shown in Figure 5. This generates (14), with\nR2 =0.96.

Plot showing how A value varies with DP.\nWhen using different parameters, the pre-exponential fac-\ntor changes accordingly to account for the changes in the\nformula caused by the adjustment of either the n or B value.\nHowever, the coefﬁcient within the exponential term is rel-\natively constant despite the changing conditions, indicating\nthat the dependence on DP is consistent and reasonably unaf-\nfected by the selection of n and B.\nB. SORPTION ENTHALPY FORMULA\nFor the form of BIT equation shown in (2) to be useful,\nnot only should it have a theoretical basis and use param-\neters on the correct temperature basis, but it should also\nﬁt to other data. Data from [20] for insulation in the new\ncondition (DP =1357) is seen to have similar parameters\nto those from [9]. Likewise, the α and β values for new\npaper (DP =1360) in [21] are similar. These parameters are\nsummarized in Table 4.\nHowever, as with the isotherm formula, it is also interesting\nto see how the parameters of the sorption enthalpy formula\nrespond to changes in DP. When considering the aged paper\nused in [20] (DP =341), the α value (451.3) is relatively\nunchanged as compared to the value for new paper given\nin Table 4, whereas the βvalue is markedly higher (0.05768).\nβfell with decreasing DP for the aged paper of [9], indicating\nthat the inﬂuence of moisture content in paper is reduced\ninstead. However, as discussed within that paper, the cellulose\nstructure may have been altered which may have affected the\nresults.\nFor the range of DP values studied in [21], the α and β\nvalues are given in Table 4. The αvalues show minor scatter\nagainst DP, however the β values have a linear relationship\nwith DP, as in (16), with R 2 >0.999. The plot of 1/DP versus\nβis shown in Figure 6.\nβ=0.029 +8.58\nDP (16)\nFIGURE 6. Plot showing howβ value varies with DP.\nBased on (16) the formula for BIT can be re-written to\naccount for DP as in (17).\nϑ =αe\n−\n(\n0.029+8.58\nDP\n)\nW\n(17)\nThe implication of β being dependent on DP but αbeing\nindependent of DP is useful in further understanding the\nphysical meaning of the equation. The indication is that β\ndescribes how moisture inﬂuences the decay of BIT. Where\nW is close to zero, the temperature is unaffected by the size\nof β. As moisture content increases, β becomes more inﬂu-\nential. Lower DP systems have a reduced moisture saturation\ncapacity, and are seen from Table 4 to have a greater βvalue.\nTherefore a large βvalue indicates that moisture is adsorbed\nless strongly at higher moisture contents. If the equation were\ninstead ﬁtted for relative saturation then the β value may\nwell be expected to show no differences between insulation\nof different ages.\nOn the other hand, α seems to be ﬁxed at around 450 K\n(177◦C), which suggests that there is an asymptotic limit on\ntemperature as W tends to zero. Again, this is sensible, as with\nno moisture present, formation of moisture bubbles must be\nimpossible, and hence the temperature given by α indicates\nthe temperature at vanishingly small (practically unobtain-\nable) moisture content in paper. The deﬁnition of ‘vanish-\ningly small’ is, of course, arbitrary. For a newly installed\ntransformer, one may expect a moisture content of the solid\ninsulation to be less than 0.5% [36], [37], for such conditions\nand a β value calculated for a DP =1200 (typical of newly\ninstalled insulation [38]), the exponential term would be\n0.982, meaning that the temperature would be around 442 K\n(169◦C).\nC. ASSESSING 140◦C LIMIT\nIt is interesting to compare the formula in (17) with the com-\nmonly held mantra that 140 ◦C is a sufﬁcient limit to protect\ntransformer insulation from bubbles [3], usually caveated to\nbeing true at 2% moisture content in paper [39]. Equation (17)\nindicates that the cellulose would need a DP of close to 800 to\nVOLUME 7, 2019 171679\nJ. P. Hillet al.: Improvements to the Construction of Bubble Inception Formulae for Use With Transformer Insulation\nhave a BIT of 413 K (140 ◦C) at 2% moisture content in paper.\nAccording to [37], 2% moisture content in paper through the\naging process alone is not reached until somewhere between\n5 and 7 average chain scissions, representing a DP very close\nto end of life (5 chain scissions on an initial DP of 1200 would\nresult in a DP of 200). The reality probably lies somewhere\nbetween these two cases (accounting for atmospheric ingress,\netc. speeding up the increase in moisture content [4]), but\nimportantly it is worth recognizing that if the DP at 2%\nmoisture content in paper is lower than 800, then the BIT will\nalso be lower than 140 ◦C in agreement with (17).\nUsing (15), a DP of 900 is found for the conditions of 2%\nmoisture in paper and 140 ◦C. A DP so close to the initial\ncondition is even less likely to be at 2% moisture during\nservice.\nD. LINKING DP RELATIONSHIP TO SATURATED MOISTURE\nCONTENT\nWhile having relationships of A and β to DP allows for the\nformulae in (6) and (2) to be updated depending on the aging\ncondition of the transformer solid insulation, it is actually the\ncapability of the cellulose to hold moisture that is of most\ninterest; here DP is merely being used as a proxy method of\nindicating the degradation of this capability over the lifetime\nof a transformer. In other work, relative saturation has been\nused for material comparisons in other work previously and\nshows promise within BIT assessment [9], [21].\nTwo different solid insulations of the same DP can have\ndifferent saturated moisture capacities, due to numerous fac-\ntors (including CI and structural differences, density, and\nlignin / hemicellulose content [14], [40], [41], as well as\nchemical treatment such as thermal upgrading [32]). For\nexample, it has been shown that moisture afﬁnity of paper\nwas negatively correlated to both nitriﬁcation and grammage\n[32]. Reference [20] showed that moisture capacity of aged\npaper (DP =341) was around 60% of that of new paper\n(DP =1357) under exposure to a range of relative humidity\nenvironments. It is thus interesting to determine how A relates\nto the saturated moisture capacity.\nFrom the data presented in [33], the absolute moisture\ncontent of paper reduces by 0.1 percentage points for each\nreduction of 100 DP, irrespective of the ‘wetness’ (the local\nrelative humidity). Conversely, [42] showed that the wetter\nthe insulation system, the greater the disparity seen between\nmoisture capacity of new and aged papers. Hence, further\ninvestigation is needed before this relationship can be adapted\ninto any BIT formulae.\nIV. FURTHER APPLICATIONS\nA. ISOTHERM EQUATION\n1) IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADDITIONAL TERM IN\nISOTHERM EQUATION\nThe BIT from the results of experiments in [6] are always\ngreater than the temperatures produced from using (6). The\ndifference between isotherm predictions and experimental\nresults are given in Table 6. The average difference is just\nover 10 K and the maximum underestimation is by 28 K.\nTABLE 6. Comparison between experimental temperatures from [6] and\npredicted temperatures based on isotherm from [18].\nThe error appears to be slightly higher for the earlier tests\n(average of 12.5 K versus 8.3 K for the ﬁnal 14 tests): this was\nthe point at which the authors changed the experiment from\na 3-coil model to a 1-coil model, and may indicate that some\nbubbles were identiﬁed later (and so at a higher temperature)\nthan they formed at in reality due to possible obstruction from\ntop and bottom coils for the 3-coil model. Alternatively the\nresearchers simply may have improved their measurement\ntechnique with experience.\nThat the calculated temperatures are lower is not overly\nsurprising. In fact, it is sensible as temperatures calculated by\nisotherms indicate where desorption occurs, but desorption\nin the form of bubbles requires additional energy input [19].\nThus, an additional term or adjustment of the B value to\naccount for the increased energy requirement is necessary\nin order to increase the calculated temperature to that of the\nobserved data.\nNote that the original term used in (1) is always positive,\nand is preceded by a negative operator; hence this function\ncan only ever reduce the temperature. Previously, this was\nsuitable where the isotherm in (6) over-estimated the temper-\nature in several instances. Thus, it must be deemed appro-\npriate to choose a term of a different form for this updated\nequation.\nPreviously, the extra term only had inﬂuence under condi-\ntions of high moisture content in paper and high gas content in\nliquid. The three largest differences between calculation and\n171680 VOLUME 7, 2019\nJ. P. Hillet al.: Improvements to the Construction of Bubble Inception Formulae for Use With Transformer Insulation\nobservation (28 K, 26 K and 18 K) are all systems which had\nlow moisture content in paper but high gas content in liquid;\nhowever there are also systems with these same conditions\nwhich have comparatively small error. There does not appear\nto be a strong dependence of the error against any of the\nparameters varied within the study (moisture content in paper,\ngas content in liquid, conservator versus gas space models).\nQuoting from [13]:\n‘‘The use of the curves to predict the moisture level in\ninsulation under non-equilibrium conditions will result in\nerroneous estimates. ’’\nThus this approach to analyzing BIT may never provide a\nbetter approximation than the one shown without including\narbitrary adjustments.\n2) SUMMARY COMMENTS ON SORPTION ISOTHERMS\nIsotherms illustrate the sorption behavior of sorbent and\nsorbate (cellulosic insulation and moisture in this scenario),\nshowing the equilibrium conditions for a certain temperature.\nHow the system of sorbent-sorbate-solution responds to per-\nturbations can be seen from the isotherms. Isotherms show\nhow a system moves toward equilibrium once a change is\nmade to the system (e.g., if sorbate is added or removed from\nthe system).\nAs in [25], the isotherm can be used to monitor how mois-\nture is distributed between cellulose and liquid insulations\nfor given temperatures. Under these equilibrium conditions,\nvariation in distribution is noted as the aging condition of the\npaper changes, and this variation itself is seen to vary at differ-\nent temperatures. Although a dependence on DP is also seen\nfor BIT, as bubbling is a relatively dynamic process which\ninvolves vigorous desorption under rapid temperature rises\none should not expect that isotherms are the most suitable\ndepiction of this process. Hence the inability to ﬁt well to all\nof the data sets.\nB. SORPTION ENTHALPY EQUATION\n1) FITTING AGAINST OTHER LITERATURE RESULTS\nThe sorption enthalpy equation shows promise as a method\nfor calculating BIT. A good test of its potential is to consider\nhow well it ﬁts to other existing data from literature.\nFitting of the data from [26] (described above in\nSection IV A) to the enthalpy equation, (2) gives an αvalue\nof 457.8 and a βvalue of 0.03842, a good match to the other\nvalues of Table 4.\nIn addition, there are two sets of results available in lit-\nerature for alternative liquids to mineral oil, [27] and [28].\nThe solid insulation used in both of these studies is new\nNTUP. Both studies reported that the BIT for ester liquids\nwas elevated compared to mineral oil.\nFitting of the desorption energy equation to the data for nat-\nural [27] and synthetic [28] esters produces the coefﬁcients\nin Table 4. It is seen that the βvalue between mineral oil and\nester for both cases is relatively unchanged suggesting that the\ndependence of BIT on moisture content in paper is unaffected\nby the liquid insulation selection (i.e., the cellulose moisture\nsaturation capacity is dominant for β).\nConversely, the αvalue for the esters was higher than for\nthe mineral oil in comparative experiments, indicating that\nthere is a BIT elevation due to the change from mineral oil to\nester liquid. The difference between ester and mineral oil α\nvalues matches with the differences identiﬁed in the BIT in\nthose studies. Note that the βvalues of each liquid (ester and\nmineral oil) in both of studies are lower than that seen in all\nof the other data sets analyzed.\nThe elevation of αmay be explained as follows: the actual\nbond between cellulose OH group and H 2O molecule may be\ninﬂuenced by the surrounding material, especially in the case\nof materials of more polar nature such as the natural ester and\nsynthetic ester used in [27] and [28], respectively. Insulating\nliquid impregnated in the cellulose may act as a force pulling\ninward, strengthening the adsorptive bond, and thus raising\nthe BIT. This behavior is similar to that of acids within paper\nwhich has been shown to increase the resistance of cellulosic\npaper to drying processes [43].\n2) REQUIREMENT OF AN ADDITIONAL TERM IN ENTHALPY\nEQUATION\nThe exponential decay of desorption temperature as moisture\ncontent in paper increases is a desirable trait of a model of\nBIT. It would be expected that BIT ‘levels off’ as the moisture\ncontent tends to a maximum value (i.e., at saturation of the\ncellulose, as at this point no more water can be added to\nthe cellulose and so desorption is not really occurring as a\nprocess). This model predicts that at saturation (choosing\n14% moisture content in paper) the BIT would be lower than\n0◦C. The data from BIT experiments shows a leveling off of\ntemperature as moisture content in paper increases at about\n7%, and a temperature of around 100 ◦C. It might be possible\nto link this leveling off to the latent heat of vaporization\nthrough the inclusion of an additional term once more data\nbecomes available.\n3) SUMMARY COMMENTS ON SORPTION ENTHALPY\nThe sorption enthalpy equation for calculating BIT appears\nto be able to ﬁt well against several data sets available in\nliterature, and has the advantage of only requiring two param-\neters ( αand β) and one variable (moisture content in paper)\nas inputs. The βvalue is shown to depend on DP.\nThe inﬂuence of βdiminishes as moisture content in paper\ntends to zero. An apparent beneﬁt is found here in that irre-\nspective of the DP of paper, the BIT of completely dry paper\ntends toward a ﬁxed value; as the paper insulation becomes\nwet, the formula describes how the BIT is reduced, with the\nβ value showing the impact of a reduced saturated moisture\ncontent of aged paper.\nEnthalpy and temperature are related concepts, but are\nnot directly commutable. Further experimental work should\nbe conducted to improve the understanding of how bubbles\nrelate to the energy input to a system, and how this affects\nthe temperature at which they form. This could provide addi-\nVOLUME 7, 2019 171681\nJ. P. Hillet al.: Improvements to the Construction of Bubble Inception Formulae for Use With Transformer Insulation\ntional improvements to BIT formulae to those shown here,\nparticularly in the case of the sorption enthalpy equation\nwhich has a strong relationship to the energy of adsorptive\nbonds.\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, this study has shown that there is a signiﬁcant\nrequirement to update the formula in place for prediction\nof BIT of transformer insulation: ﬁrstly, the errors found in\nthe formula as supplied should be corrected; and secondly,\nthe use of desorption isotherms needs great care when assess-\ning bubble formation.\nIt is apparent that not all data available in literature shows\nthe behavior modeled by the formula as currently employed\nin the standards. It is shown in this study that improvements\nmay be made by using a formula based on desorption enthalpy\ninstead of sorption isotherms. The alternative formula is\nbased on a better representation of bubbling activity yet\nrequires fewer input variables, in spite of which, accuracy of\nBIT is not lost.\nNote that there are restrictions when ﬁtting equations to\nthe BIT data found in existing literature. Most data sets\nare small (in many cases used within this study, four or\nﬁve data points for one material / material condition), and\nﬁtting across a data set therefore does not necessarily yield\nhigh accuracy across the full range. A method considered\nto combat this is to combine data from different studies,\nhowever the range of conditions used in experiments are\nvaried, and not always clearly stated [11] and so this was not\ndone.\nAlthough we espouse the use of the enthalpy equation in\nplace of the isotherm equation based on the ﬁndings of this\nstudy and the concerns even of its proposer, it is important\nto keep in mind that irrespective of the formula in place, this\nstudy has emphasized the need for predictions of BIT to be\nsensitive to material conditions – particularly the saturated\nmoisture capacity of cellulose or DP.\nThe dependence of DP has been shown for both of the\nequations based on data available from existing studies. Fur-\nther, the use of the heralded 140 ◦C limit needs to be taken\nwithin the context of the transformer condition, particularly\nin relation to the insulation DP and moisture content in paper.\nEqually, this paper discusses the theoretical basis for the\ncoefﬁcients used in the two equations and shows how they\ncan be used and altered in order to incorporate transformer\ninsulation types and conditions. This will help to develop\na loading guide which accounts for these features of trans-\nformer insulation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to Cargill,\nEPRI, M&I Materials, National Grid, SGB-SMIT, Shell\nGlobal Solutions, SP Energy Networks, TJ |H2b Analyti-\ncal Services, and WEIDMANN Electrical Technology for\ntheir ﬁnancial and technical contributions to the Transformer\nResearch Consortium at The University of Manchester.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Power Transformers—Part 7: Loading Guide for Mineral-Oil-Immersed\nPower Transformers, document IEC 60076-7, 2018.\n[2] IEEE Guide for Loading Mineral-Oil-Immersed Transformers and Step-\nVoltage Regulators, IEEE Standard C57.91-2011, (Revision of IEEE Stan-\ndard C57.91-1995), 2011.\n[3] ‘‘Thermal aspects of transformers,’’ E-Cigre, Tech.
