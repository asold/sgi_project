I NTRODUCTION\nE\nNERGY harvesting (EH) is a topic of intensive research,\npromising battery-free operation of massive networks of\nwireless IoT devices [1]. To fulﬁll that goal, IC circuits featur-\ning ultra-low power (ULP) consumption with ultra-low voltage\n(ULV) supply are desired. As an example, thermal electric,\nhuman vibration and photovoltaic EH, as shown in Fig. 1,\nproduce ULV supplies (<0.3 V) that are well below the thresh-\nold voltage ( V\nth) of even the most recent FinFET CMOS\ntransistors, thus making it extremely challenging for circuit\ndesigners. On the other hand, all-digital PLLs (ADPLL) are\nwell known for their friendliness to low supply voltages and\nimmunity from supply perturbations [2].

Supply voltage from energy harvesters is typically low and highly\ndependent on the underlying energy activity.\npower consumption in the whole ADPLL lies in a digitally\ncontrolled oscillator (DCO) [2], [3]. Thus, new special cir-\ncuit techniques are needed to make the IoT devices function\nproperly with supplies below Vth.\nA transformer feedback oscillator [4] is a promising topol-\nogy for ULV operation due to its passive RF voltage gain.\nHowever, the gates and drains of the cross-coupled transistors\nthere share the same dc voltage. This causes the resonating\nfrequency, mainly due to its voltage-dependent gate capaci-\ntance C\ng, to strongly track (i.e., be pushed by) the supply\nvoltage, VDD. For EH, the supply pushing must be very low\ndue to the signiﬁcant temporal variability of harvested voltage,\nas indicated in Fig. 1. The varying harvested voltage could be\nhundreds of mV , which is >10× larger than in conventional\nconsumer IC designs.\nA class-F oscillator [5] also provides a passive voltage gain,\nbut the gates are electrically separated from the drains via\nthe transformer, thus resulting in a low frequency pushing.\nHowever, its V\nDD cannot readily go below Vth since the DCO\ntuning word voltage would not be able to reliably switch the\ncapacitors at such low supply. In [6], a self voltage-boosting\ntechnique was proposed to provide a high-enough control volt-\nage of VCO for the sufﬁcient tuning range. A voltage booster\nusing a GHz-level clock consumes excessive power and brings\nhigh frequency spurs, which must be then properly ﬁltered.\nThis brief is an extension of our conference paper [7] in\nwhich a triﬁlar-coil oscillator topology providing large passive\nvoltage gain was proposed to enable the sub- V\nth operation.\nA π-model for a three-winding transformer is introduced to\nexplain the resonant frequency and impedance transformation\nwhich helps to generate ﬁne tune resolution.

The 3rd-harmonic tone is\ncoupled from the primary resonator to the source side, making\na smaller effective ISF function. Due to the gate/drain isolation\nas well as smaller voltage dependent-capacitance in advanced\nFinFET technology, this brief achieves very low frequency\npushing. To provide the bias and control voltages which are\nhigher than V\nDD, a switched-capacitor based DC-DC converter\nwith a ring-based non-overlapped clock generator is proposed\nfeaturing a nearly zero power consumption.\nII. T\nHREE -WINDING RESONATOR DESIGN\nA conventional two-winding 1:2 transformer in a class-F\noscillator can be thoroughly analyzed by a T-model of\nFig. 2(a) [5]. However, if the number of windings is larger\nthan 2, it is hard to adopt the T-model due to the duplicate\nmutual inductance effects. In [8], a π-model was adopted for\na multi-winding transformer. In Fig. 2(b), V\n1, V2 and V3 repre-\nsent the primary, secondary and tertiary voltage sources. There\nare two ideal transformers in the middle with a perfect cou-\npling coefﬁcient k = 1. Capacitors C1, C2 and C3 are digitally\ntunable to control the resonant characteristic of the network.\nThe values of various inductances and turns ratios are captured\nin formulas (1)–(3) [8]:\nN1 = LM23\nLM13\n,N2 = LM23\nLM12\n(1)\nLM = LM12LM13\nLM23\n,L1 = L11 − LM12LM13\nLM23\n(2)\nL2 = L22 − LM12LM23\nLM13\n,L3 = L33 − LM23LM13\nLM12\n(3)\nwhere L11, L22 and L33 represent self-inductances of the pri-\nmary, secondary and tertiary coils, respectively. Inductance\nL1 equals L11 minus LM, which is a mutual inductance\npart. Without the magnetic coupling, L1 reduces to the\nself-inductance L11.T e r m sLM12, LM23 and LM13 represent\nmutual inductances between L11, L22 and L33, which could\nbe obtained from electromagnetic (EM) simulations or mea-\nsured with the other windings unloaded. From Fig. 2(b), the\nimpedance transformation could be easily realized by the ideal\ntransformers 1:N\n1 and 1:N2. To calculate the equivalent induc-\ntance ( Leq) seen from the primary coil, capacitors C1−3 are\nexpediently removed. In this design, the secondary coil is con-\nnected to a high impedance (MOS gate), so the end-point of\nL2 is considered open and its inductance could be ignored.\nThen, Leq could be obtained as:\nLeq = N2\n2 L1LM + L1L3 + LML3\nLMN2\n2 + L3\n(4)\nThe equivalent capacitance seen from the primary coil could\nbe also derived from the impedance transformations:\nCeq = C1 + N2\n1 C2 + N2\n2 C3 (5)\nIn this design, N1 and N2 are equal to 1.87 and 0.37, respec-\ntively. Hence, N2\n2 is signiﬁcantly smaller than 1 and so C3\ncould be neglected in Ceq. Thus, the resonant frequency seen\nfrom the primary coil is derived as:\nωosc =\n\n√\n1\n(C1 + N2\n1 C2)N2\n2 L1LM+L1L3+LML3\nLMN2\n2 +L3\n(6)\nLM, L1, L2 and L3 are equal to 0.41, 0.15, 0.29 and 0.37 nH,\nrespectively. C1 and C2 are set to 1 pF. The estimated resonant\nfrequency is 3.34 GHz which is within a 3% error from EM\nsimulations. Since the DCO requires a variable capacitance\nfor frequency tuning, the DCO gain ( KDCO) could be derived\nas [2]:\nKDCO(f ) = 2π2(Leq · /Delta1C)f 3 (7)\nKDCO(f ) is a frequency step in response to a small digitally\ninduced /Delta1C step. If /Delta1C is placed at the tertiary coil, KDCO\ncould be re-written as:\nKDCO,T(f ) = 2π2[Leq ·\n(\nN2\n2\n1 + N2\n1 + N2\n2\n)\n· /Delta1C3] f 3 (8)\nKDCO,T represents the DCO gain contributed by the ter-\ntiary resonator. Eq. (8) shows that /Delta1C3 will experience a\n0.03× reduction. This helps with generating very ﬁne tun-\ning resolution (i.e., low KDCO) by setting a small ratio of\nN2\n2 /(1 + N2\n1 + N2\n2 ). The very ﬁne KDCO helps with reducing\nthe quantization noise of ADPLL in order to avoid a power\nhungry /Sigma1/Delta1modulator [2], [9].\nTo leverage the advantage of class-F operation from a signif-\nicant presence of the 3rd harmonic, the turns ratio of primary\nto secondary is set to 1:2 in this design. In Fig. 3, Zin into the\nprimary represents the input impedance seen from V1 with a\n3rd harmonic tone. By setting C1 = C2 = C3, Zin of the ter-\ntiary could also have a strong 3rd harmonic impedance peaking\nas shown by the blue curve. If the tertiary winding is adopted\nat the source side of MOS, V\nGS could be reshaped to beneﬁt\nfrom the lowered impulse sensitivity function (ISF).\nIII. D ESIGN OF TRIFILAR DCO\nThe conventional class-F oscillator can provide a nearly 2 ×\npassive voltage gain due to the 1:2 turns-ratio transformer\nfrom the drain (D) to gate (G) of the MOS transistors. In\nthe proposed triﬁlar oscillator, the passive voltage gain is\nenhanced by another winding located at the source (S) of the\ncross-coupled transistors, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The tertiary\n2880 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS—II: EXPRESS BRIEFS, VOL. 67, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2020\nFig. 3. Input impedances of three-winding transformer tank.\nFig. 4. Proposed triﬁlar oscillator: (a) schematic, (b) time-domain waveforms,\n(c) small signal π-model.\nwinding is coupled through a weak magnetic coupling 1: N2\nfrom the original primary winding. Consequently, the NMOS\nsource signal ( VS) oscillates around the ground dc level and\nproduces a voltage swing in the opposite direction to that\nof V\nG, thus enhancing VGS, as shown in Fig. 4(b). A higher\neffective VGS is thus achieved.\nV oltageVB controls the gate bias of cross-coupled NMOS\nindependently from VDD due to the isolating effect of the trans-\nformer. The nonlinear capacitance CG is typically 3 × larger\nthan CD and so it would normally be the main contributor to\nthe frequency pushing. Since VB does not drain any current,\nit can undergo a heavy low-pass ﬁltering to eliminate any of\nits transient effects on CG.\nThe coarse bank with 23 MHz/bit is split between the\ntransformer’s primary and secondary windings to achieve\nthe maximum Q enhancement [5]. The switched-capacitor at\nthe source side can reach a very ﬁne resolution of 1.3 kHz,\nas suggested by (8), which could help in eliminating the\npower-hungry /Sigma1/Delta1modulator in an ADPLL.\nThe small-signal model of the triﬁlar oscillator is shown in\nFig. 4(c). The primary side in Fig. 2(b) is equivalent to the\ndrain side of cross-coupled MOS, and so on. The voltage loop\ngain could be derived by the formula for V\nout/Vin:\nVout\nVin\n≃ gm(RO||Zin(s)) LM\nL11\n(N1 + N2) (10)\nZin(s) could be represented the long formula (9), as shown at\nthe bottom of the page. From Eq. (10), the voltage loop gain\nFig. 5. ISF function beneﬁting from the 3 rd harmonic injection.\ncould be enhanced by the term (N1+N2). For the same start-up\ncondition, the device’s required transconductance gm could be\nreduced 55% at the sub- Vth bias while the passive voltage\ngain is already boosted up by 220% [2]. Thus, the supply\nvoltage could be brought down to 0.2 V or lower, while still\nensuring the reliable oscillation start-up. As shown in Eq. (10),\nhigher N\n1 and N2 beneﬁcially bring higher passive voltage\ngain. However, excessively large N2 might bring strong source\ndegeneration and degrade the MOS’ gm.I nF i g .4 ( c ) ,GmVin\nand Ro bypass the tertiary winding for the sake of simpliﬁed\nderivation. The value of N2 needs to be traded off between the\nactive and passive voltage gains.\nFor the three-winding transformer, the effective quality fac-\ntor could be calculated by Qtri =ℑ (Ztot)/ℜ (Ztot). The total Qtri\nwill be a weighted combination of Q-factors of the three coils.\nTwo thick metals and one ultra-thick metal are combined to\nachieve the lowest possible series resistance for the maximum\nQ-factor and minimum voltage drop in the supply path. Q\ntri\nexceeds 11 within 3–4 GHz of the DCO tuning range (TR).\nIV . PHASE NOISE (PN)\nFigure 5 demonstrates the ISF function beneﬁting from the\n3rd harmonic injection. At the top, the red curve is a waveform\nVGS of the original class-F oscillator. The blue curves con-\ntain an additional 3rd harmonic injected into the source, thus\nachieving a higher amplitude by the tertiary feedback. At the\nzero-crossing points, the 3rd harmonic injection helps to nar-\nrow down the zero-crossing regions where the injected noise\ncan severely degrade the phase noise. This effectively reduces\nthe normalized noise modulating function (NMF) as indicated\nby the arrows at the middle of Fig. 5. Thus, a smaller effective\nISF function and lower ( ∼2 dB) PN could be achieved.\nV. D C -\nTO-DC C ONVERTER\nAs mentioned above, if the available supply is below\nVth, then the sub-threshold control voltage of the switched-\ncapacitor will lead to a very narrow tuning range. Furthermore,\nas this topology separates the drains and gates to enhance the\noverall g\nm at low VDD, VB bias higher than VDD is needed\nZin(s) = s(N2\n2 L1LM + L1L3 + LML3)\ns2(N2\n2 L1LM + L1L3 + LML3)(C1 + N2\n1 C2) + LMN2\n2 + L3\n(9)\nLI et al.: 0.2-V THREE-WINDING TRANSFORMER-BASED DCO IN 16-nm FinFET CMOS 2881\nFig. 6.

Consequently, a tiny DC-to-DC con-\nverter coupled to the harvested voltage is proposed to provide\na nearly static control Vctrl and bias VB for the triﬁlar DCO. A\ncross-coupled voltage booster could help to generateVDD+VCK\nby the nonoverlapped clocks CLK 1 and CLK 2,a ss h o w ni n\nFig. 6(a). During T 1, point A is charged to near VDD.I nt h e\nnext interval, T 2, CLK2 changes from 0 V to VDD and point\nB is charged to near VDD and waiting for the next period\nfor the boost-up. The important concern is for CLK 1 and\nCLK2 to be non-overlapped; otherwise, M 1 and M 2 might\nbe turned-on simultaneously and degrade the level of V OUT.\nCIN is designed to ensure the adequate current sinking from\nVOUT. In this design, VB drains no static current due to the\ngate load connection and static control. Vctrl only consumes\ndrain/source leakage of the buffer which drives the frequency\ntuning switched-capacitor. Thus, C IN could be at the level of\nonly tens of fF.\nIn conventional designs, a non-overlapped clock generator\noften comprises combinatorial logic to generate certain delays.\nA logic cell (e.g., NAND, NOR) usually requires at least three\nstacked MOS transistors, thus raising the minimum opera-\ntional level of V\nDD. Here, a non-overlapped clock generator\nis proposed using a simple ring oscillator (RO) with a clock\ngating technique, as shown in Fig. 6(b). A multi-phase single-\nended 7-stage RO generates seven clock phases, from A to G.\nThe switcher’s inverters use a different gate control to gen-\nerate the rising/falling edges of CLK\n1 and CLK 2. Thus, the\nnonoverlapped period is deﬁned as TRO/N, where TRO is the\nperiod of ring oscillator and N = 7 is the number of RO stages.\nThe number of series-connected MOS in this circuit will not\nexceed two, which helps to operate at V\nDD lower than 0.2 V .\nVin provides the input to the voltage booster and directly con-\ntrols the drain side of MOS. To save extra power from the\nRO, the oscillation frequency is set to tens of MHz by using\nsmall W/L-ratio inverters.\nVI. C\nIRCUIT IMPLEMENTATION\nFigure 7 presents the overall view of this design. Five\nvoltage booster stages driven by the non-overlapped clock\ngenerator provide a sufﬁciently high voltage to turn on the\nswitched capacitors. This way, the full tuning range (i.e.,\n<20%) can be recovered. A high-enough voltage for V\nctrl\nFig. 7. Triﬁlar DCO with DC-DC converter.\nFig. 8. Die micrograph.\ncould also help to eliminate the frequency pushing effect from\nthese switches. VB uses a selected voltage booster output. Low-\npass ﬁlter of 3 kHz corner is adopted to eliminate the ripple\nfrom voltage booster and to prevent the DCO PN degrada-\ntion. Ripples of the lower frequency (i.e., <30 kHz) could be\nmitigated by the eventual ADPLL loop.\nVII. M EASUREMENT\nThe proposed triﬁlar DCO is implemented in 16-nm FinFET\nCMOS, whose chip micrograph is shown in Fig. 8. Figure 9\nshows on-wafer phase noise measurements. At the VDD =\n0.4 V setting, phase noise (PN) reaches −120 to −123 dBc/Hz\nand −143 to −145 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz and 10 MHz offsets,\nrespectively. FOM is 188–191 dBc/Hz with a power consump-\ntion of 3.8 mW. In the VDD = 0.2V mode, the PN worsens to\n−111∼− 113 dBc/Hz and −132 ∼− 135 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz\nand 10 MHz offsets, respectively, but the power consump-\ntion reduces to 0.6 mW, yielding FOM of 186–188 dB. The\nﬂicker PN corner is 40 kHz and 120 kHz at 0.2 V and 0.4 V ,\nrespectively. The frequency pushing in Fig. 10(a)(b) shows a\nsmall value of 3.627 MHz/V at 0.4 V and 12.6–38.2 MHz/V\nat 0.2 V . The coarse step size is 23 MHz/bit and the ﬁne step\nis 1.3 kHz/bit. The DC-to-DC converter could operate at as\nlow as 0.15 V , consuming only 0.2 uW at the 0.2 V input, as\nshown in Fig. 10(c). The proposed approach allows the DCO to\nultimately operate at as low as 0.17 V of the harvested voltage.\nTo check for any spurs from the ring oscillator of non-\noverlapped clock generator, the measured phase noise with\nand without the DC-DC converter is shown in Fig. 10(d).\n2882 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS—II: EXPRESS BRIEFS, VOL. 67, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2020\nFig. 9.

Table I shows comparison with state-of-the-art\nlow-voltage LC-tank oscillators. Our V\nDD is the lowest while\ndelivering state-of-the-art performance. The area of 0.11 mm 2\nis among the lowest. The frequency pushing and ﬂicker noise\ncorner frequency are both the lowest, mainly due to the triﬁlar\ntopology and the use of FinFET devices.\nVIII. C\nONCLUSION\nThis brief demonstrates a DCO for energy harvesting appli-\ncations, which eliminates the intermediary power management\nsystem in conventional IoT solutions. By virtue of a triﬁlar-\ncoil design, a passive voltage gain is boosted to overcome the\nstart-up issues at a low supply voltage of 0.2 V . Separating the\ngate and drain voltages by the triﬁlar-coil transformer helps\nto bring the DCO supply below the threshold voltage. The\nvariable capacitance from the gate side is separated from the\nmain supply, thus eliminating the supply pushing effects by\nmeans of a low-pass ﬁlter. Fine tune resolution is achieved\nby means of impedance transformation from the tertiary coil.\nClass-F operation makes the waveform sharper for a better 1/f\nnoise immunity and ISF. A tiny built-in DC-to-DC converter\nprovides the gate biasing and control voltage for the switch\ncapacitors with negligible power consumption. To operate at\na low-supply voltage, a ring-based non-overlapped clock is\ngenerated by the gated inverters. Realized in TSMC 16-nm\nFinFET, it consumes sub-mW at 0.2 V , while achieving state-\nof-the-art performance. This brief shows a high potential for\nthe solution of low-supply, low power consumption and low\nsupply pushing in portable wireless applications.\nR\nEFERENCES\n[1] Q. Wan, Y .-K. Teh, Y .
