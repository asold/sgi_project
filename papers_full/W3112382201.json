  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 5 million infections and 300,000 deaths worldwide. Many survivors of the illness are likely to have long-term symptoms and disability that will pose a significant burden to the healthcare systems and economies all over the world. Given the scale of the burden and lockdown measures in most countries, there is a need for a pragmatic tele-assessment tool to screen for needs and target rehabilitation interventions in time. A comprehensive multi-system telephone screening tool called COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Screening (C19-YRS) tool has been developed by multi-disciplinary-rehabilitation teams from Leeds, Airedale and Hull NHS Trusts to assess and capture symptoms and guide rehabilitation interventions for these individuals. The tool has been shown to cover all the components of the WHO ICF Framework.",
