The DCR is calculated with\ndifferent assessment tools to identify\na POD. Obviously, with different\nassessment tools, one may calculate\ndifferent DCRs, which make com-\nparison difﬁcult.

After applying the three\ndifferent assessment tools the number\nof patients, before exclusion of med-\nical reasons or age, was 76 for the\nIBD-FOUR deﬁnition, 104 patients\nfor the IBD-GCS deﬁnition and 107\npatients based on the OPTN deﬁnition\nof imminent neurological death. We\nnoted the highest DCR (36.5%) in the\nIBD-FOUR deﬁnition.\nConclusion: The deﬁnition of\nimminent brain death based on the\nFOUR-score is the most practical tool\nto identify patients with a realistic\nchance to become brain dead and\ntherefore to identify the patients most\nlikely to become POD.\nKeywords Brain death /C1\nCritical care organisation /C1Ethics /C1\nNeurotrauma /C1Stroke /C1\nTransplantation\nIntroduction\nIn most Western countries, absolute numbers of brain\ndead patients are declining [1–3]. Approximately 80–90%\nof these patients suffer from aneurysmal subarachnoid\nhaemorrhage (SAH), traumatic brain injury (TBI) or\nintracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) [2, 4–7]. Progress in the\nprevention and treatment of these three conditions has led\nto a steady decline in the pool of potential heart-beating\norgan donors over the past few decades [ 8–14].\nOrgan donation rates in countries are often expressed as\nthe donor rate per million population. This comparison tool\nis not an appropriate measure because several factors may\ninﬂuence the total number of potential organ donors\n(PODs). For instance, the number of intensive care beds,\nneurosurgical facilities, road trafﬁc accidents and cerebral\nIntensive Care Med (2011) 37:665–670\nDOI 10.1007/s00134-011-2131-6 ORIGINAL\nhaemorrhages differ per country and are not considered in\nthis comparison tool [ 1]. Another comparison tool that is\noften used and is not affected by the above-mentioned\nfactors is the donor conversion rate (DCR). The DCR is\ndeﬁned as the actual number of organ donors divided by the\nnumber of patients who are regarded as PODs. Organ pro-\ncurement organisations in the USA aim to achieve a DCR of\nat least 75% [15], but the actual DCRs in the USA, UK and\nGermany are estimated to be in the range of 42–68% [1, 16–\n18]. However, using a DCR has practical limitations. The\nDCR is calculated with different assessment tools to iden-\ntify a POD. Using different assessment tools results in\ndifferent DCRs, which make comparison difﬁcult.\nOne of the difﬁculties associated with the quantiﬁca-\ntion of the number of PODs is the different deﬁnitions of\na POD [ 19, 20]. To compare groups of PODs between\ndifferent hospitals or countries, a uniform deﬁnition of a\nPOD is needed. This may be hampered by international\ndifferences concerning inclusion or exclusion of PODs\nbased on age or medical contraindications to organ\ndonation. With a uniform deﬁnition, the causes of non-\nprocurement can be assessed, and ways of improving\nDCRs can be developed. Recently, we formed an inter-\nnational expert consensus panel and proposed a deﬁnition\nof a POD by deﬁning imminent brain death [ 21].\nIn the present study we investigate the pool of\npotential heart-beating organ donors in a cohort of\npatients, who died from SAH, TBI or ICH in the intensive\ncare unit (ICU), using three different assessment tools for\nPODs. Our aims were to determine if these tools could be\nused for an accurate estimation of a potential donor pool\nand to ascertain how they compare to each other with\nregard to the DCRs, by using a cohort of PODs.\nMaterials and methods\nWe conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who\nwere admitted to a 32-bed medical/surgical ICU in a\nuniversity hospital between 1 January 2006 and 31\nDecember 2008, and died from SAH, TBI or ICH. Lists of\nthese patients were obtained from three independent\nsources: the patient-data management system of the ICU\n(Critical Care Manager 8.1; Picis, Inc. Wakeﬁeld, MA,\nUSA), the central hospital patient registry and the medical\nchart review database of the Dutch Transplant Foundation.\nThese three lists were then crosschecked. Patient age, sex,\ndates of admission and death, deﬁnitive diagnosis based on\ncomputed tomography, cerebral angiography, clinical\nexamination and outcome on ICU discharge were extrac-\nted from the medical records. From the patients who died\nin the ICU from SAH, TBI or ICH, we extracted the last\nknown absent brain stem reﬂexes and the reason for non-\nprocurement, if applicable. After identifying this cohort of\npatients, we applied the following three different assessment\ntools, which included two deﬁnitions of imminent brain\ndeath (IBD) that we recently proposed in this journal [ 21]\nand a deﬁnition used in the USA:\n1. Imminent brain death [ 21], Glasgow Coma Score\n(GCS) based (IBD-GCS): deﬁned by a GCS score of 3\nand at least 3 out of 6 absent brain stem reﬂexes [ 21].\n2. Imminent brain death [ 21], based on a Full Outline of\nUnResponsiveness (FOUR) score [ 22–24]o fE\n0M0B0\nR0 (IBD-FOUR), which represents eyelids remaining\nclosed with pain (E 0), no response to pain or gener-\nalised myoclonus status (M0), absent pupillary, corneal\nand cough reﬂex (B 0) and absence of spontaneous\nventilation or apnoea (R 0)[ 21].\n3. Imminent neurological death (IND) as deﬁned by the\nOrgan Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN)\nin the USA and published on their website (see\nhttp://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov). The OPTN deﬁned\nimminent neurological death as ‘‘a patient … with\nsevere neurological injury and requiring ventilator\nsupport, who upon clinical evaluation…has an absence\nof at least three brain stem reﬂexes’’. Age, which is part\nof this deﬁnition, is excluded from our statistical anal-\nysis to prevent its inﬂuence on the comparison.\nAll patients in our cohort underwent regular neuro-\nlogical evaluations by a neurologist during their stay in\nthe ICU because of their deteriorating neurological con-\ndition. This resulted in an accurate record of neurological\nexaminations in the medical charts that could be used for\nretrospective analysis of the deﬁned neurological assess-\nment tools.\nStatistics\nNormally distributed continuous variables are described\nas means with standard deviations (SD), and skewed\ncontinuous variables are described as medians with\ninterquartile ranges (IQR). Binary variables are described\nas proportions. Differences between the three subgroups\nwere tested with analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the\nTukey post hoc test for normal continuous distributed\nvariables; the Kruskal–Wallis test was used for skewed\ncontinuous variables. All binary variables were analysed\nusing the chi-square test.\nResults\nDemographics\nBetween 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2008, 3,429\npatients were admitted to the ICU, where the overall\nmortality was 647/3,429 (18.9%). We identiﬁed a cohort\nof 564/3,429 (16.4%) patients who were diagnosed with\n666\nSAH, TBI or ICH, of whom 179/564 (31.7%) died. These\n179 patients comprised 27.6% of the overall ICU mor-\ntality. The medical charts of two patients, who died as a\nresult of SAH, could not be retrieved and were therefore\nexcluded from the analysis.\nTable 1 shows the demographics of the non-survivors\ndivided into three subgroups. Between the period from 2006\nto 2008, 25 patients became heart-beating organ donors, 23\nof whom died from SAH, ICH or TBI; one patient became\nbrain dead as a result of post-anoxic encephalopathy after\ncardiac arrest and one patient with TBI, who was transferred\ndirectly from the emergency department to the operating\ntheatre for multi-organ donation, was excluded from the\nanalysis. A total of 36 patients, who were admitted to the ICU\nwith SAH, ICH or TBI, donated one or more organs; 13 of\nthese patients were non-heart-beating (NHB) organ donors.\nPotential organ donors\nAfter we applied the three different assessment tools, the\nnumbers of patients who fulﬁlled the criteria for IBD or\nIND, before exclusion due to medical reasons or age, and\nwere regarded as PODs were as follows: 76 according to\nthe IBD-FOUR deﬁnition, 104 according to the IBD-GCS\ndeﬁnition and 107 based on the OPTN deﬁnition of IND\n(Fig. 1). Examining the detection rates of the different\nassessment tools before exclusion for medical reasons or\nage revealed incremental increases in the percentages of\ndetection of PODs as a result of the broadening of the\nselection criteria (see Table 2). The highest detection of\nPODs was noted in the SAH admission group.\nIBD-FOUR\nOf the 179 patients who died from SAH, TBI or ICH, 76\n(42.5%) were eligible for organ donation after applying the\nIBD deﬁnition based on the FOUR score. After exclusion\ndue to age (1 patient) and medical reasons, such as malig-\nnancy, sepsis or viral infections (12 patients), 63 patients\n(35.1%) were identiﬁed as PODs. Of this cohort, 26 patients\ndonated one or more organs: 23 were heart-beating organ\ndonors and 3 were non-heart-beating organ donors. The\nmajority of the patients (56.6%) who were identiﬁed as\nPODs by this deﬁnition were admitted to the ICU after an\nSAH, followed by 25.0% after TBI and 18.4% after ICH.\nIBD-GCS\nOf the 179 patients who died from SAH, TBI or ICH, 104\n(58.1%) were eligible for organ donation, after applying\nthe IBD-GCS deﬁnition. After exclusion due to age (3\npatients) and medical reasons, such as malignancy, sepsis\nor viral infections (16 patients), 85 patients (47.5%) were\nidentiﬁed as PODs. Of this cohort, 29 patients donated\none or more organs; 23 were heart-beating organ donors\nand 6 were non-heart-beating organ donors. The majority\nof the patients (51.0%) who were identiﬁed as PODs by\nthis deﬁnition were admitted to the ICU after an SAH,\nfollowed by 26.0% after TBI and 23.1% after ICH.\nIND-OPTN\nOf the 179 patients who died from SAH, TBI or ICH, 107\n(59.8%) were eligible for organ donation, after applying\nthe IND-OPTN deﬁnition. After exclusion due to age (3\npatients) and medical reasons, such as malignancy, sepsis\nor viral infections (16 patients), 88 patients were identi-\nﬁed as PODs. Of this cohort, 29 patients donated one or\nmore organs; 23 were heart-beating organ donors and 6\nwere non-heart-beating organ donors. The majority of the\npatients (51.4%) who were identiﬁed as PODs by this\ndeﬁnition were admitted to the ICU after an SAH, fol-\nlowed by 25.2% after TBI and 23.4% after ICH.\nReasons for non-procurement\nAfter we applied the assessment tools to deﬁne a POD,\nfamily refusal accounted for more than 50% of the non-\nprocurements in two of the three deﬁnitions. Comparison\nbetween the three assessment tools showed a family\nrefusal rate of approximately 75% in the ICH group and\napproximately 40–50% in the SAH and TBI groups. Other\nreasons for non-procurement included malignancy, sepsis,\nTable 1 Demographics of patients died from SAH, TBI or ICH ( n = 179)\nSAH ICH TBI P value\nNo. of patients (%) 73 (40.8) 45 (25.1) 61 (34.1)\nAge, year ( ±SD) 56.7 (10.3) 58.7 (14.1) 49.8 ( ±20.5) \\0.05\nFemale sex, no.

Resulting from\nrestrictions that are incorporated into the IBD-FOUR\ndeﬁnitions, three NHB donors were not identiﬁed as\npotential heart-beating organ donors. These patients sus-\ntained serious neurological damage but retained one or\nmore brainstem reﬂexes (one patient was ventilated on\npressure support settings and two patients had positive\ncornea reﬂexes) and were excluded by the application of\nthe IBD-FOUR deﬁnition. The IBD-FOUR deﬁnition\nshowed the highest DCR of 36.5%, which is still low\nwhen compared to other published DCRs [ 1, 16, 17]. As\nstated before, comparison is difﬁcult with different deﬁ-\nnitions of a POD. An additional seven potential NHB\ndonors were not identiﬁed in our cohort by using the three\nassessment tools, reﬂecting the high sensitivity of these\ntools for potential heart-beating organ donors.\nRegardless of the deﬁnitions of a POD, we identiﬁed a\nconsiderably substantial group of patients with a high risk\nof becoming brain dead. However, most of the patients,\nwho we considered to be PODs, did not proceed to fulﬁl\nofﬁcial brain death criteria. Before the formal brain death\ndetermination, relatives were often informed about the\npoor prognosis and the possibility of organ or tissue\ndonation. If relatives of a patient declined organ donation,\nFig. 1 Flowchart of the assessment tools.

Some\npatients, when treatment was withdrawn, had some\nremaining positive brain stem reﬂexes and, hypotheti-\ncally, were not identiﬁed by using one of the assessment\ntools. It is possible that some of these patients would have\ndeteriorated into a state of imminent brain death after\ncontinuation of treatment, probably resulting in an\nunderestimation of the full potential of PODs.\nA POD, as deﬁned in this study, is considered a risk\nestimate of a possible outcome for a patient. This risk\nestimate has to be realistic to provide health-care profes-\nsionals with accurate data. For instance, if every patient\nadmitted to an ICU was considered a POD, a DCR will\nnever achieve a goal of 75% or higher. The OPTN deﬁ-\nnition is illustrative of this because it is the only deﬁnition\nthat does not include any formal and validated neurolog-\nical assessment tool for the level of consciousness. This\nresults in the largest group of patients who could be\nregarded as PODs before exclusion due to medical reasons\nand age; this did not increase the identiﬁcation of PODs\nwho actually proceeded to organ donation. The result of\nthis deﬁnition is a low DCR. The use of a less speciﬁc\ndeﬁnition of a POD, such as the OPTN, results in a low\nDCR and a high estimate of the reasons for non-procure-\nment if we examine heart-beating organ donation. The\nhigh estimate of reasons for non-procurement is the result\nof the inclusion of a large group of patients who are\nineligible for heart-beating organ donation. Regardless of\nthe deﬁnitions used, the patients who died from SAH were\nmost likely to become heart-beating organ donors. After\nreviewing our data, we conclude that using the deﬁnition\nof imminent brain death, based on the FOUR score [ 23],\noffers the most accurate estimation of a pool of PODs, due\nto a more detailed neurological assessment of critically ill\nneurological patients in the ICU. One should keep in mind\nthat although a high DCR correlates with a higher speci-\nﬁcity of the assessment tools used in our study, it does not\nnecessarily translate into an increased rate of organ pro-\ncurement. Therefore, a prospective validation of the\ndifferent assessment tools is necessary.\nOur study has some limitations. First, it is a single-\ncentre study, and data were obtained by retrospective\nmedical chart review. As is the case for all observational\nstudies, some cases may have been missed in a non-ran-\ndom manner. Second, the neurologists who assessed the\npatients did not record the data regarding the GCS score\nand the last known absent brain stem reﬂexes at a pre-\ndeﬁned moment, resulting in data recorded at different\nstages during treatment. This is a troublesome limitation\nof the retrospective nature of this study. Third, to illus-\ntrate the use of the different assessment tools, we selected\npatients based on their diagnosis and outcome. We used\nthis cohort to apply three different deﬁnitions to analyse\nour ICU population to determine the donor potential and\nthe reasons for non-procurement in a transparent way.\nConclusion\nBrain dead patients are a scarce but important source of\norgans. This report shows that the assessment tools used\nare easy to apply and easy to report in a comprehensive\nway. The deﬁnition of imminent brain death based on the\nFOUR score appears to be the more neurologically\npractical tool for identifying patients with a realistic\nchance of becoming brain dead. A prospective study is\nnecessary to validate these assessment tools.\nAcknowledgments We would like to thank Julius de Vries of the\nDepartment of Information Technology, Erasmus MC Rotterdam,\nin the Netherlands for extracting the necessary data for this study.\nWe are also grateful to Nichon Jansen and Andries Hoitsma for\ntheir critical comments on the manuscript.
