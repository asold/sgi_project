However, capuchin monkeys, apes, and corvids are the\nspecies that have produced the most impressive examples [4,5].\nAmong those are cases of sequential tool use in which a tool is used\nto obtain another tool, which subsequently will serve to obtain an\nout-of-reach goal (e.g., food). Nonetheless, instances of sequential\ntool use among non-human animals are rather scarce. Bird &\nEmery [6] have argued that the difficulty in sequential tool use\nstems from three problems: First, the subject must recognize that\none tool can be used on another or on nonfood items. Second, the\nsubject must resist the immediate motivation to use the tool to\nattempt to access the food directly, and third, the individual must\nbe capable of hierarchically organized behavior.\nIn the laboratory, one of the most common tasks to test\nsequential tool use consists of presenting subjects with a reward\nthat is out of reach, a readily available tool that is not long enough\nto reach for the reward but long enough to reach for another tool,\nwhich can be used to reach for the reward. Subjects have to use\nthe tools sequentially by first using the shorter tool to retrieve the\nlonger tool and secondly using the latter to reach for the food.\nSpontaneous use of up to two tools in sequence has been reported\nin chimpanzees [7], gorillas and orangutans [8] and capuchin\nmonkeys [9]. Macaques [10] and cotton-top tamarins [11] can\nalso use tool in sequence after receiving some training. In fact,\ntraining was instrumental in one of the most impressive instances\nof sequential tool use ever recorded [12]. The chimpanzee Julia\nproved capable of using up to five tools in sequence. The difficulty\nin the task resided in the fact that she had to look at a transparent,\nlocked box to determine what kind of key was needed to open it,\nand then find that key in another transparent locked box. This\nsecond box in turn also required a key that Julia had to find in still\nanother transparent locked box and so on up to five boxes, all\npresented simultaneously. It is unclear whether Julia would have\nsucceeded without the benefit of the various pre-training phases\nthat she received.\nMore recent investigations of sequential tool use in corvids have\nshown that this ability is not only exclusive to primates. Non-tool\nusing rooks (Corvus frugilegus ) have been reported to use tools\nsequentially by spontaneously dropping a large stone into a\ncontainer to release a small stone, which was then used to acquire\nfood [6]. In another study, New Caledonian crows were reported\nto use an immediately available short stick to reach for an out-of-\nreach long stick (placed in a box), and subsequently use the long\ntool to reach for the reward in a vertical tube [13,14].\nWimpenny, Weir, Clayton, Rutz and Kacelnik [1] have also\nreported that New Caledonian crows use tools in a sequence using\na different experimental setup. In this study, crows were presented\nwith an out-of-reach reward, two tools that were available but too\nshort to reach the food and four out-of-reach tools differing in\nfunctionality. The distance of the food and/or which tools were\nrequired to get it defined the different experimental conditions.\nTherefore, the position of the food reward and/or tools dictated\nwhat sequence of behavioral actions was required for a successful\ncompletion of the task. Wimpenny et al. [1] found that crows were\nable to use up to three tools in sequence in order to get the reward.\nOne of the successful subjects did so even when he did not receive\nany pre-training with the elements of the task. However, subjects’\nperformance was not perfect. In fact, subjects sometimes used\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e52074\nsmall tools to fish for longer ones when there was no ultimate food\nreward present.\nHowever, all the above-mentioned studies have some method-\nological limitations that prevent us from drawing unambiguous\nconclusions regarding subjects’ performances in the sequential\ntool-use tasks (see Wimpenny et al., [1]). First, in most of the\nstudies the out-of-reach tool was positioned in close proximity to\nthe food reward or between the subject and the reward\n[10,11,15,16]. Therefore, using this set-up does not rule out a\npotential retrieval of the inaccessible tool by misdirecting the\nimmediately available tool towards the out of reach tool and, thus,\nretrieving the latter by chance. Second, in some studies, subjects\nreceived training on the basic elements of the tasks (i.e. reaching\nfor food with a tool and/or interacting with the constructs later\ncontaining the inaccessible tool(s)) before being presented with the\nactual test [e.g. 8, 10, 13, 14, 15]. Hence, such procedure could\npotentially have enabled them to solve the tasks by simply chaining\nthe crucial elements which had become secondary reinforcers.\nEpstein, Kirshnit, Lanza, Rubin [17] suggested that linking the\npreviously learned behaviors into a novel sequence was the\nproduct of simple, associative learning mechanisms such as\ncompetition between behavioral repertories, automatic chaining,\nand functional generalization. Nevertheless, linking might also be\ndependent on the ability of an animal to organize learned\nbehaviors hierarchically into behavioral chains with goals and sub-\ngoals, although, to date, there is no conclusive evidence for this\n[18,19].\nThird, some studies have presented the animals with only the\npotential correct tools to solve the problem [10,11,13,14].\nTherefore, it is not surprising that the animals tried to use those\ntools in some way, especially if the tools were sticks for which the\nanimal had a natural or learned predisposition to manipulate.\nThus, presenting subjects with several tool options might be more\ninformative because they are required not only to use tool in\nsequence but also to select which tools are necessary to solve the\ntask. Wimpenny et al. [1] found that some of the inexperienced\nNew Caledonian crows they tested did not always chose the\ncorrect stick under those conditions.\nFinally, the studies on sequential tool use have not controlled for\nthe cost of retrieving the out-of-reach tool/s. For instance,\nWimpenny et al. [1] concluded that crows did not take into\naccount the distance at which the food was placed in the tube\nbecause subjects tended to always retrieve the longest out-of-reach\ntool. However, while the cost of retrieving the longest out-of-reach\ntool was not very high (i.e. except for one of the conditions, all\ntools were evenly aligned and, therefore, equally accessible), the\nbenefits of using the longest tool were always extremely high (i.e.\nthe longest out-of-reach tool was the only tool that allowed subjects\nto succeed in all the experimental trials).\nIn the current study we investigated sequential tool use in\nchimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), orangutans (Pongo abelii) and bonobos\n(Pan paniscus) using the same setup that Wimpenny et al. [1] used\nto test New Caledonian crows. In particular, subjects faced an out-\nof-reach piece of food, two readily available tools (only one of\nwhich was sufficiently long to retrieve either food or further tools)\nand four out-of-reach tools. The food reward was placed on the\nopposite side from the out-of-reach tools so that the direct visual\ncomparison of depth of the reward and lengths of tools was\nimpossible. In different conditions we varied the distance of the\nfood and/or which tools were required to get it. What sequence of\nbehavior was required to solve the different conditions depended\non the position of the food reward and/or tools. In order to solve\nthe task, subjects had to use the longer stick readily available to\nreach for a longer out-of-reach tool, which allowed them to\nretrieve that reward. These sequences of actions were necessary for\nall the sequential trials except for the one in which the food was\nplaced the closest to the subjects (i.e. Primary). Then, the longer of\nthe two readily available tools sufficed to retrieve the reward.\nWe adopted Wimpenny’s et al. [1] design for two reasons. First,\nit allowed us to directly compare the performance of three great\nape species with New Caledonian crows, thus fostering direct\ncomparisons both inside and outside the great ape clade. The\ncomparison between apes and corvids, especially those that\ntypically use tools, is particularly appealing in light of the idea\nthat these two taxonomic groups have undergone convergent\ncognitive evolution [20]. Second, Wimpenny’s et al. [1] design\ncontrolled for some of the methodological limitations of previous\nstudies. In particular, the food was not close to the tools, and its\ndistance could not be directly compared to the length of the tools.\nUnlike Wimpenny et al. [1], however, we did not train the apes on\nany task prerequisites although all apes had experience using tools\nand some had been tested in a sequential tool-use task (see\nMethods). Additionally, we increased the costs of reaching for the\nlongest out-of-reach tools in Experiment 2. Such variations would\nallow us to draw more precise conclusions about which elements of\nthe task subjects took into account when retrieving an out-of-reach\ntool (i.e. whether subjects took into account the distance at which\nthe food was placed in order to select the tool of the appropriate\nlength).\nExperiment 1\nIn this experiment we closely followed Wimpenny et al.’s [1]\nsetup with the New Caledonian crows. Subjects were presented\nwith four out-of-reach tools, which could be extracted by using an\nimmediately available short stick. The distance at which the food\nwas placed on the platform, defined the number of tools necessary\nto obtain the reward. Therefore, depending on the food distance,\nsubjects were required to use from 1 to up 3 tools. It is important\nto note, though, that in contrast to the study with the crows, our\nsubjects did not receive any pre-testing experience.\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects\nEight chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), three bonobos (Pan paniscus)\nand four orangutans (Pongo abelii) housed at the Wolfgang Ko¨hler\nPrimate Research Center (WKPRC) in the Leipzig Zoo partici-\npated in this experiment. There were 9 females and 6 males\nranging from 10 to 29 years of age (see Table 1). All subjects had\nparticipated in a variety of cognitive tests, some of which included\ntasks involving sequential-tool use (see Table 1). Groups of apes\nwere housed in semi-natural indoor and outdoor enclosures with\nregular feedings, daily enrichment and water ad lib. Subjects\nvoluntarily participated in the study and were never food or water\ndeprived. Research was conducted in the sleeping rooms. No\nmedical, toxicological or neurobiological research of any kind is\nconducted at the WKPRC. Research was non-invasive and strictly\nadhered to the legal requirements of Germany. The study was\nethically approved by an internal committee at the Max Planck\nInstitute for Evolutionary Anthropology (the joint ethics commit-\ntee of the MPI-EVA and the Zoo Leipzig). Animal husbandry and\nresearch comply with the ‘‘EAZA Minimum Standards for the\nAccommodation and Care of Animals in Zoos and Aquaria’’, the\n‘‘WAZA Ethical Guidelines for the Conduct of Research on\nAnimals by Zoos and Aquariums’’ and the ‘‘Guidelines for the\nTreatment of Animals in Behavioral Research and Teaching’’ of\nthe Association for the Study of Animal Behavior (ASAB). IRB\napproval was not necessary because no special permission for the\nSequential Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e52074\nuse of animals in purely behavioral or observational studies is\nrequired in Germany.\nApparatus\nThe test apparatus consisted of three platforms (see Figure 1): a\nfood-platform (platform A: 79.5 cm width655 cm length) where\nwe placed the food, a sliding table (platform C: 78 cm\nwidth637 cm length) where we placed the two within-reach tools,\nand a tools-platform (platform B: 65 cm width 6104 cm\nlength651 cm height) where we placed the out-of-reach tools.\nFixed to the surface of the latter, at a distance of 14 cm from the\nsubjects, there were five equally sized parts of green-colored plastic\nboards (12 cm width690 cm length and 3 mm thick). Between\nthese boards we built four channels of approximately 1.3 cm width\neach, placed at 12 cm from each other, where we placed the tools.\nTools were wooden sticks with square cross section of 10 mm\ndiameter. The immediately available tools or within-reach tools\nhad a length of 10 cm and 20 cm, and the out-of-reach tools were\n25 cm, 35 cm, 45 cm and 55 cm in length. The out-of-reach tools\nwere spatially and visually separated from the reward (see\nFigure 1). We used banana slices as rewards. Corks (4.5 cm long\nand of 1.3 cm diameter) and wooden ‘bricks’ (3 cm63c m62 cm)\nwere used as no-tool objects.\nProcedure\nSubjects were individually tested in their indoor cages after\nbeing separated from their groupmates. Young infants stayed with\ntheir mothers while the test took place. The experimenter (E) first\nplaced the food on the platform A, then she placed the four out-of-\nreach tools on platform B and finally the two within-reach tools on\nplatform C (Fig. 1). Before placing the out-of-reach tools, for each\ntool E showed its full length to the ape by holding crossways for 5\nseconds. Note that platform B was positioned so that subjects were\nfacing away from the platform A when retrieving the tools from\nthe platform B (see Figure 1). A trial began when E pushed\nplatform C towards the mesh panel and ended when either\nsubjects obtained the food, they removed all tool/objects (in\nconditions No-food/No-tools), or after a maximum duration of 5\nminutes. If subjects were still trying to get the tools or food after 5\nminutes, the trial continued until they either obtained the food or\nthey stopped reaching for more than 1 min.\nThere were different types of trials defined by the distance at\nwhich the food was placed (d1, d2, d3; see Table 2) and the\nnumber of tools required for retrieving the reward (see Tables 3).\nAll subjects received three types of trials (Table 3): sequential\n(experimental) trials (Primary, Secondary-Any, Secondary-Long\nand Tertiary), no-goal (control) trials (‘No-food’ and ‘No- Tools’)\nand Length-only (control) trials (d1, d2, d3). In the sequential\ntrials, the depth of the food and distance of the tools from the mesh\ndictated the sequence of behavior necessary to retrieve the food,\nwith the most demanding condition being the Tertiary because it\nrequired the use of 3 tools in sequence (see Table 3 for a summary\nof all conditions). The use of tools that differed in functionality\nallowed us to investigate if apes were able to take into account the\nrelevant features of the problem: distance at which the food was\nplaced, the length of the tool required to retrieve the food, and\nnumber of tools necessary to obtain the reward.\nIn No-food trials, no reward was present. The purpose of these\ntrials was to test firstly whether tools would still be extracted (in\nwhich case the tools themselves may be reinforcing), and secondly,\nwhether subjects would probe the empty food-platform (which\nwould indicate that the action of probing was relatively inflexible).\nIn No-tools trials the tools were swapped for non-tool objects\n(wooden bricks or corks) and food was placed at an intermediate\ndepth (see Table 2). The purpose of these trials was to see if\nsubjects would probe for these objects, and if they retrieved them\nfrom the platform B, whether or not they would then use them in\nplatform A.\nIn the Length-only control trials, the procedure was the same as\nthe sequential trials with the important difference that now the\nout-of-reach tools were placed within subjects’ reach. Here, E\nplaced the out-of-reach tools on the separate tray (50 cm650 cm)\n4 cm away from the mesh. Similar to the sequential trials, subjects\nwere presented with the two within-reach tools. These trials were\ncarried out to determine whether sequential tool use may have\nimposed additional cognitive demands that may have hampered\ntool selection. Following Wimpenny et al. [1]’s logic, if apes chose\nthe wrong tool more often in the sequential trials than in the\nLength-only trials, this may indicate that the former involved\nhigher cognitive demands than the latter.\nSubjects received nine sessions of six trials each (54 trials in\ntotal). Only sequential trials and no-goal control trials were\nincluded in these nine sessions. Each type of sequential and no-\ngoal control trials was randomly assigned within one session and\neach type of trial was presented only once in each session. The\nposition of the out-of-reach tools and within-reach tools was\ncounterbalanced across trials. For the non-tool conditions, 50% of\nthe subjects were presented with the bricks as non-tool objects and\nthe other 50% with the corks. Following the completion of these\nnine sessions, all subjects received an additional 30 ‘Length-only’\ncontrol trials distributed in 5 sessions with 6 trials each. Subjects\nreceived ten intermixed trials of each of three food depths: d1, d2\nand d3 cm (each type of trial was presented twice in each session).\nAll subjects received first Experiment 1 followed by Experiment 2.\nTable 1.Name, gender, age, rearing history, order in which\nexperiments were conducted and objects used for Non-tools\ncondition (* indicates previous subjects’ experience in\nsequential tool use tasks).\nSubject Gender\nAge\n(years)\nRearing\nhistory Order Objects\nChimpanzee\nFrodo M 17 Mother raised 2, 1 Bricks\nAlex M 10 Mother raised 1,2 Bricks\nLome M 10 Mother raised 1,2 Corks\nJahaga F 18 Mother raised 2,1 Corks\nFifi F 18 Mother raised 1,2 Bricks\nSandra F 18 Mother raised 1,2 Bricks\nPia F 12 Mother raised 2,1 Corks\nAlexandra F 12 Nursery raised 2,1 Corks\nBonobo\nJoey M 28 Nursery raised 1,2 Corks\nKuno M 14 Nursery raised 1,2 Bricks\nYasa F 13 Unknown 1,2 Bricks\nOrangutan\nBimbo* M 29 Nursery raised 1,2 Bricks\nDokana* F 21 Mother raised 1,2 Corks\nPadana F 12 Mother raised 1,2 Corks\nPini1* F 22 Mother raised 1,2 Bricks\n*Mulcahy, Call & Dunbar (2005)\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0052074.t001\nSequential Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e52074\nHowever, in order to rule out order effects, 50% of the\nchimpanzees were presented first with Experiment 1 and then\nExperiment 2 and for the other 50% received the reversed order.\nData Scoring and Analysis\nWe videotaped all trials. For each trial we scored whether\nsubjects retrieved the food (i.e. correct responses), which within-\nreach tool they retrieved, where they first probed (platform with\nthe food or platform with the out-of-reach tools), which out-of-\nreach tool they retrieved first, and which out-of-reach tool they\nused first. A second independent observer scored a randomly\nselected sample of 20% of trials to assess inter-observer reliability,\nwhich was excellent for all the variables (retrieved food: Cohen’s\nk = 0.99; within-reach tools: Cohen’s k = 0.97; first probing:\nCohen’s k = 0.97; first out-reach tool taken: Cohen’s k = 0.97;\nfirst-out-of-reach tool used: Cohen’s k = 0.92). Additionally, in the\ncorrect trials (i.e. subjects obtained the reward), we scored whether\ntheir correct performances were ‘‘perfect’’ (i.e. take the appropri-\nate tool and use it) or whether it contained errors. A correct\nresponse was scored as ‘‘perfect’’ if it was sensitive to the demands\nof the tasks; for example, in the Primary condition the longest\nwithin-reach tool was long enough to retrieve the reward,\ntherefore if apes used such tool rather than any of the out-of-\nreach tools, their response was scored as ‘‘perfect’’ (see Table 3 for\nthe expected perfect responses in relation to the food location and\nlength of the tools). We scored three different errors depending on\nthe tools first taken and the tools first used: (a) subject takes the\nincorrect tool and uses it, (b) subject takes first the incorrect tool,\nthen takes and uses the correct one, and (c) subject takes the\ncorrect tool, then takes the incorrect but uses the incorrect one.\nWe calculated the percentage of trials in which subjects\nobtained the reward (i.e. overall success). We used non-parametric\ntests because the data was not normally distributed. We used\nFriedman tests to analyze subjects’ success in the sequential trials\nand Length-only trials. Friedman tests were also used to investigate\ndifferences in first probing behaviors and first tools used. We also\nFigure 1.

Since Wimpenny et al. [1] examined crows’ behavior in\nthese trials by comparing their performance in these control trials\nwith their performance in the Secondary-any trial (because it was\nthe simplest sequential trial), we did the same. Wilcoxon tests were\nrun for post-hoc comparisons and to assess whether subjects\nperformed above chance levels. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to\ninvestigate species differences. Mann-Whitney-U test was used to\nanalyze whether order in which the two experiments were\npresented had any effect in chimpanzees’ performance. Exact p\nvalues were calculated in all cases. All tests were two-tailed.\nResults\nSince 50% of the chimpanzees were presented first with\nExperiment 1 and the other 50% with Experiment 2, we\ncompared both groups’ performance in the sequential trials to\ncheck whether order of presentation had any significant effect on\ntheir success rates. A Mann-Whitney test revealed that success did\nnot differ between the two groups of chimpanzees (Secondary-any:\nU = 4.000,p = 0.429; Secondary-long:U = 2.000,p = 0.143; Ter-\ntiary: U = 2.500,p = 0.143; Primary:U = 8.000,p = 1.000;N =8\nfor all cases). Therefore, we pooled the data from the two groups\nfor subsequent analyses.\nSequential Trials\nSuccess. We found that subjects’ overall success differed\namong the 4 types of sequential trials (Friedman test:x2 = 25.67,\ndf = 3, p,0.001). Whereas all subjects obtained food in all the\nPrimary trials, their success rates in the other conditions decreased\nas the task complexity increased (see Figure 2). In fact, post-hoc\ntests showed that subjects performed significantly better in the\nSecondary-any (Wilcoxon test: T = 0.00, p = 0.004, n = 9) and\nSecondary-long conditions (T = 0.00, p = 0.008, n = 8) than in the\nTertiary conditions. Subjects also performed better in the Primary\ncondition than in the Secondary-long (Wilcoxon test: T = 0.00,\np = 0.008, n = 8) and Tertiary conditions (T = 0.00, p = 0.001,\nn = 11). We did not find species differences for any of the\nsequential trials (Kruskal-Wallis test: Primary:x\n2 = 0.000, df = 2,\np = 1.000; Secondary-any:x2 = 0.126, df = 2,p = 0.877; Second-\nary-long: x2 = 2.934, df = 2,p = 0.241; Tertiary:x2 = 3.671, df = 2,\np = 0.171;N = 15 in all cases). Subjects solved the Secondary-any\n(x2 = 6.23, df = 1, p = 0.013, 11/13 correct) and Secondary-long\nconditions (x2 = 8.33, df = 1, p = 0.004, 11/12 correct) significantly\nabove chance in the first trial. This was not the case for the\nTertiary condition (x2 = 1.33, df = 1, p = 0.248, 4/12 correct) (see\nTable 4 for individual performances).\nOut-of-reach-tools or food. Except for 3 subjects (Alex,\nBimbo and Joey), all apes reached for the out-of-reach tools in the\nsequential trials (see Table 4 for individual performances in each\ntype of trial). Apes chose significantly above chance the 20 cm\nwithin-reach tool (as opposed to the 10 cm tool) in 91.35% of the\ntrials (Wilcoxon test: T = 0.00, p,0.001, n = 15). When we\nanalyzed if subjects used the 20 cm tool to reach for food or to\nreach for the out-of-reach tools, we found significant differences in\ntheir performance among the 4 different types of trials (Friedman\ntest: x\n2 = 26.56, df = 3, p,0.001; mean % (SEM): Primary = 44.44\n(10.45), Secondary-any = 62.21 (9.25), Secondary-long = 82.96\n(7.26), Tertiary = 77.77 (9.26)). Subjects reached for the out-of-\nreach tools significantly more often in the Secondary-long and\nTertiary than in the Primary trials (Wilcoxon test: TSecLong = 0.00,\np,0.001, n = 13; Wilcoxon test: TTertiary = 0.00, p = 0.001, n = 11)\nand Secondary-any trials (Wilcoxon test: T SecLong = 6.50,\np = 0.003, n = 12; Wilcoxon test: TTertiary = 3.50, p = 0.021, n = 9).\nFirst out-of-reach tool used. We found significant differ-\nences among the 4 out-of-reach tools that apes used to get the food\nin the Primary condition (Friedman test: x2 = 25.93, df = 3,\np,0.001); Secondary-any condition (Friedman test: x2 = 29.06,\nTable 3.Description of sequential and length-only trials for Experiment 1.\nCondition\nCondition\ntype Phase\nFood\nposition Trial description\nMost task-sensitive\nbehavior for success\nSecondary-any Sequential 1 d2 The four out-of-reach tools are placed flush with\neach other on the table.

To further investigate subjects’ performance, we\nexamined the errors that they made in the sequential trials in\nwhich they successfully retrieved the reward. Results showed that\nin the Secondary-any (Wilcoxon test: T = 0.00, p,0.001, n = 13;\nmean % (SEM): perfect = 84.39 (3.49); errors = 15.61 (3.49)) and\nSecondary-long trials (Wilcoxon test: T = 11.00, p = 0.047, n = 11;\nmean % (SEM): perfect = 62.19 (5.05); errors = 37.81 (5.50))\nsubjects’ perfect responses were more frequent than responses\ncontaining errors. We did not find significant differences between\nperfect performances and responses containing errors in the\nPrimary trials (Wilcoxon test: T = 48.50, p = 0.529, n = 15; mean\n% (SEM): perfect = 54.81 (10.59); errors = 45.19 (10.78)).

Results showed no significant differences in subjects’\noverall success across the 3 different food depths (Friedman test:\nx2 = 5.60, df = 2, p = 0.111; Figure 2). When we compared\nsubjects’ performance in the sequential trials with their corre-\nsponding trials in the Length-only condition (see Figure 2), we\nfound that subjects’ overall success was significantly better for the\nd3 condition than the Secondary-long condition (Wilcoxon test:\nT = 0.00, p = 0.016, n = 7) and Tertiary (Wilcoxon test: T = 0.00,\np = 0.002, n = 10).\nFirst (out-of-reach) tool used. Subjects only took the 20 cm\nwithin reach tool in 2.67% of the trials and they never took the\n10 cm within-reach tool. We found significant differences among\nthe 4 tools that apes used to get the food in the d1 condition\n(Friedman test: x\n2 = 40.42, df = 3, p,0.001); d2 (Friedman test:\nx2 = 28.15, df = 3, p,0.001) and d3 condition (Friedman test:\nx2 = 32.69, df = 3, p,0.001). In all conditions subjects showed a\nclear preference for using the longest tool (Wilcoxon test: d1\nT = 0.00, p,0.001, n = 15; d2: T = 5.50, p = 0.001, n = 14; d3:\nT = 13.00, p = 0.005, n = 15) (see Figure 3). A comparison of the\naverage length of the tool selected in each condition revealed no\nsignificant increase in tool length as a function of the distance to\nthe reward (Friedman test:x2 = 1.84, df = 3, p = 0.429; mean cm.\n(SEM): d1 = 50.73 (0.66), d2 = 50.84 (0.82), d3 = 51.71 (0.67),\nd4 = 53.07 (0.36)).\nErrors.

Wilcoxon post-hoc test\nshowed that subjects extracted tools more often in the Secondary-\nany trials than in the Primary condition (T = 10.00, p = 0.038,\nn = 11). The same was true for the No-tools (T = 4.00, p = 0.006,\nn = 12) and No-food conditions (T = 0.00, p = 0.001, n = 10).\nSubjects did not probe with the objects on food-platform. Only\ntwo subjects probed once (trials 2 and 5, respectively) when there\nwas no food on the platform and one subject did so twice (trials 1\nand 5).\nDiscussion\nAll fifteen subjects targeted the out-of-reach tools in the Length-\nonly trials and twelve out of fifteen subjects did so in the sequential\ntrials. Subjects used up to 3 tools in a sequence. Subjects’ success in\nthe sequential trials was determined by the complexity of the task;\nin fact, their performance was significantly diminished in the\nTertiary trials, in which subjects were required to use 3 tools in a\nsequence to successfully retrieve the reward. They performed\nbetter in the Length-only trials than in the sequential trials only\nwhen the food was placed at the farthest distance from them.\nApes were able to recognize when they needed to use a tool to\nreach for another one because, in contrast to the Length-only or\nPrimary trials, they used the longer within-reach tool in the\nsequential trials to reach for the out-of-reach tools first. Likewise,\nsubjects’ performance in the Tertiary trials confirms these findings,\nbecause apes used 3 tools sequentially to get the reward. Subjects\nwere able to solve the Secondary-any and Secondary-long\nconditions on the very first trial. However, this was not the case\nfor the Tertiary condition, in which only four out of twelve subjects\nsolved the problem in the first trial. Nevertheless, these results are\nremarkable since apes were neither trained in the different steps of\nthe task nor received familiarization trials before the experiment.\nDespite subjects’ good overall performance in the sequential\ntrials, their correct responses in these trials were not perfect. In\nfact, ‘‘perfect’’ responses occurred more often in the Secondary-\nany and Secondary-long sequential trials than in the Tertiary\ntrials; that is, in those trials in which the use of only 2 tools in\nsequence, rather than 3, was necessary to retrieve the food.\nComparisons between sequential and Length-only trials confirmed\nthat ‘‘perfect’’ performances occurred more often in d2 and d3\ntrials than in Secondary any and Tertiary trials, respectively; that\nis, when only the use of one tool was necessary to retrieve the food.\nWe examined no-goal trials to investigate whether tools were\nextracted only when required. Apes almost never probed with the\ntools when there was no food on the platform and they extracted\nmore tools when it was required than when they were not needed\nfor extractions (i.e. Primary, No-tools). Additionally, subjects never\nused the objects to retrieve the food from the platform. These\nresults suggest that apes took into account the requirements of the\ndifferent experimental situations and behaved accordingly. Note\nthat even though in Wimpenny et al.’s study, crows probed the\nfood-frame on fewer No-food trials than predicted by chance, all\nsubjects did insert tools into the (empty) food-frame on at least one\ntrial. Similar to our results, crows rarely probed for the food with\nthe extracted non-tool objects.\nOur results also showed that apes were sensitive to the distance\nof the food on the platform since they reached more often for the\nout-of-reach tools when the food was placed at a farther distance\nthan when it was placed at a closer distance on the platform.\nSimilar to Wimpenny et al’s results, we also found that when the\nfood was positioned at an intermediate distance (d2), subjects\ntended to first try to retrieve the food with the longer within-reach\ntool. Wimpenny et al. suggested that these mistakes could be due\nto subjects’ difficulty at estimating how far they could reach with\nthe longer within-reach tool. However, we believe that this\nexplanation does not account for our results. Otherwise, subjects\nwould have also used the shortest within-reach tool to reach for the\nfood when it was placed at a closer distance. This was not the case.\nTherefore, we suggest that it is the short distance (less than 7 cm)\nbetween d1 and d2 that could have led our subjects to perceive\nboth distances as being very similar and, in consequence, to use\nthe 20 cm tool to reach for the reward in d2.\nSimilar to what it has been reported for crows, we also found\nthat apes had a strong tendency to use first the longer out-of reach\ntools, irrespectively of condition. However, in those trials in which\nonly the longest out-of-reach tool could be used to successfully\nretrieve the reward, apes only used the 55 cm tool more often in\nthe Secondary-long condition but not in the Tertiary condition.\nLikewise, in the Length-only trials, apes selected the longest tool\nindependently of the distance at which the food was placed.\nAlthough this may indicate that apes lack tool selectivity, it is\nconceivable that our setup was not adequate to detect it. In fact,\nexcept for the Tertiary condition, the out-of-reach tools were\nalways all evenly aligned and, therefore, the costs of extracting any\nof the tools in those sequential trials were exactly the same.\nInterestingly, a closer inspection of the errors made in the correct\ntrials helps to shed some light on this issue. Our results showed that\nin the Primary trials ‘‘perfect’’ performances occurred more often\nthan in d1 trials. Subjects also made fewer errors in the Secondary-\nany than d2. We believe that these results could be due to the costs\nassociated with the Primary and Secondary-any trials. When the\nlonger tools were out of subjects’ reach, in the Primary condition\napes tended to be more selective and use the 20 cm tool more\noften than when the longer tools were within subjects’ reach. The\nopposite is true for the Secondary-any trials: given that the longer\ntools were not within immediate reach, subjects tried to reach for\nthe food with the 20 cm. We addressed this issue in the next\nexperiment by introducing greater costs for retrieving the longer\nout-of-reach tools in the experimental conditions. If the apes were\nsensitive to these costs they should become more selective in their\ntool choices.\nExperiment 2\nThis experiment focused on tool selectivity when the costs of\nretrieving longer out-of-reach tools were increased. Indeed,\nprevious research with humans [21,22] and great apes [8] have\nshown that adding some type of cost (e.g. time to see the task)\naffects how selective subjects are at choosing tools with the\nappropriate length. In Experiment 2 we increased the costs of\nretrieving the longer out-of-reach tools by placing them at\nprogressively longer distances from the mesh; so that only the\nshortest out-of-reach tool (25 cm) was reachable with the within-\nreach tool. Then, each tool had to be used sequentially in order to\nextract the next longer one. Thus, in order to obtain the longest\nout-of-reach tool, apes had to use 5 tools in a sequence. We\npredicted that if apes took into account the distance at which the\nfood was placed on the platform, they should only retrieve the\nnecessary number of tools according to the food depth and,\nconsequently, only retrieve the longest out-of-reach tool when the\nfood was placed at the farthest distance from them.\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects\nWe tested the same subjects that participated in Experiment 1.\nSequential Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e52074\nApparatus\nWe used the same apparatus as in Experiment 1 except that we\neliminated the use of corks and wooden bricks because subjects\nreceived no no-goal control trials.\nProcedure\nWe followed the same general procedure as in Experiment 1\nwith some changes. Whereas in Experiment 1 the food could be\nplaced at 3 different distances, in Experiment 2 the reward was\nplaced at 4 different distances (see Table 2). Thus, the sequence of\nbehavior and the number of out-of-reach tools required to obtain\nthe reward were dictated by the depth at which food was placed,\nwith the most demanding condition requiring the use of 5 tools in\na sequence (see Table 4 for an overview of all the conditions). Also,\nunlike Experiment 1, we excluded the No-tools or No-food control\nconditions, and we provided subjects with only one within-reach\ntool (20 cm) rather than two.\nAll subjects received 2 types of trials (Table 5): sequential trials\n(Primary, Secondary, Quaternary and Quinary) and ‘‘Length-\nonly’’ control trials (d1, d2, d3, d4). In contrast to Experiment 1, in\nthe sequential trials the out-of-reach tools were not evenly aligned\non the platform but were displaced by some distance one after the\nother with the shortest being the closest to the mesh and the\nlongest being the farthest from the mesh (Figure 4). Thus for each\ntype of sequential trial, only the 25 cm out-of-reach tool was\ndirectly retrievable with the 20 cm within-reach tool. Then, the\n25 cm out-of-reach tool could be used to retrieve the 35 cm out-\nof-reach tool. Therefore, each out-of-reach tool had to be used to\nextract the next longer tool. Similar to Experiment 1, in the\n‘‘Length-only’’ trials the tools were placed within subjects’ reach.\nSubjects received nine sessions of 8 trials each (72 trials in total).\nEach type of sequential and Length-only control trial were\nrandomly assigned within one session and each type trial presented\nonly once in each session. The position of the out-of-reach tools\nwas counterbalanced across trials.\nData Scoring and Analysis\nWe videotaped all trials. For each trial we coded the same\nresponses that we coded in Experiment 1. A second independent\nobserver scored a randomly selected sample of 20% of the trials to\nassess inter-observer reliability, which was excellent for all the\nvariables (retrieved food: Cohen’s k = 1; within-reach tools:\nCohen’s k = 0.97; first probing: Cohen’s k = 0.98; first out-reach\ntool taken: Cohen’s k = 0.97; first-out-of-reach tool used: Cohen’s\nk = 0.94). We coded subjects’ correct responses in the same way as\nin Experiment 1, that is, whether correct responses were ‘‘perfect’’\nor whether they contained errors (see Table 5) for the expected\nperfect responses in relation to the food location and length of the\ntools).\nWe calculated the percentage of trials in which subjects\nobtained the reward (i.e. overall success). We used non-parametric\ntests because the data was not normally distributed. We used\nFriedman tests to analyze subjects’ success in the sequential trials\nand Length-only trials. Friedman tests were also used to investigate\ndifferences in first probing behaviors and first tools used. Wilcoxon\ntests were run for post-hoc comparisons and to assess whether\nsubjects performed above chance levels. We used the Kruskal-\nWallis test to investigate species differences. Mann-Whitney-U test\nwas used to analyze whether order in which the two experiments\nwere presented had any effect in chimpanzees’ performance. Exact\np values were calculated in all cases. All tests were two-tailed.\nResults\nWe first checked whether chimpanzees’ performance was\naffected by the order in which they were presented with\nExperiment 1 and Experiment 2. A Mann-Whitney-U test\nrevealed that success did not differ between the two groups of\nchimpanzees (Secondary-any: U = 7.500,p = 1.000; Quaternary:\nU = 7.000, p = 1.000; Quinary: U = 7.000, p = 0.857; Primary:\nU = 8.000,p = 1.000;N = 8 for all cases). Therefore, we pooled the\ndata from the two groups for subsequent analyses.\nSequential Trials\nSuccess.

Except for 3 subjects (Joey, Alex\nand Bimbo), all subjects reached for the out-of-reach tools in the\nsequential trials (see Table 6 for individual performances in each\ntype of trial). When we analyzed if subjects used the 20 cm tool to\nreach for food or to reach for the out-of-reach tools, we found\nsignificant differences in their performance among the 4 different\ntypes of trials (Friedman test:x2 = 36.33 df = 3, p,0.001; (mean %\ntrials (SEM): Primary = 21.62 (5.99), Secondary-any = 38.88\n(7.79), Quaternary = 94.22 (2.64), Quinary = 96.75 (2.20)). Sub-\njects reached for the out-of-reach tools more often in the\nSecondary-any (Wilcoxon test: T = 2.00, p = 0.021, n = 10),\nQuaternary (T = 3.00, p = 0.013, n = 14) and Quinary (T = 3.00,\np = 0.013, n = 14) than in the Primary trials; they also reached for\nthe out-of-reach tools more often in the Quaternary (T = 1.00,\np = 0.003, n = 13) and Quinary (T = 1.00, p = 0.003, n = 13) than\nin the Secondary-any trials.\nFirst out-of-reach tool. We found significant differences\namong the 4 out-of-reach tools that apes used to get the food in\nSecondary-any condition (Friedman test: x\n2 = 9.75, df = 3,\np = 0.017); Quaternary condition (Friedman test: x2 = 18.90,\ndf = 3, p,0.001), Quinary condition (Friedman test: x2 = 10.89,\ndf = 3, p = 0.012), but not in the Primary condition (Friedman test:\nx2 = 2.14, df = 3, p = 0.693) (see Figure 6). Subjects had no clear\npreference for any of the more frequently used tools in the\nSecondary-any (Wilcoxon test: T = 26.50, p = 0.336, n = 12),\nQuaternary (Wilcoxon test: T = 24.00, p = 0.490, n = 11) or\nQuinary (Wilcoxon test: T = 20.50, p = 0.292, n = 11) conditions.\nIn fact, when we analyzed if subjects were more selective in the\nQuinary condition (the only condition in which only the 55 cm\ntool could be used to retrieve the reward), we found that subjects\ndid not significantly use the 55 cm out-of-reach first (Wilcoxon\ntest: T = 21.50, p = 0.330, n = 11). A comparison of the average\nlength of the tool selected in each condition revealed that tool\nlength increased as a function of the distance to the reward\n(Friedman test: x\n2 = 14.37, df = 3, p = 0.001, mean cm.

To further investigate subjects’ performance, we\nexamined the errors that they made in the correct sequential\ntrials.

When we compared subjects’ performance in the\nsequential tool trials with their corresponding trials in the Length-\nonly condition, we found that subjects’ overall success was\nsignificantly better for the d2 condition than the Secondary-any\ncondition (Wilcoxon test: T = 0.00, p = 0.016, n = 7) the d3\ncondition than the Quaternary condition (Wilcoxon test:\nT = 0.00, p = 0.002, n = 10) and d4 condition than Quinary\ncondition (Wilcoxon test: T = 0.00, p,0.001, n = 14). Subjects\nonly took the 20 cm in 1.11% of the trials.\nFirst (out-of-reach) tool used. We found significant differ-\nences among the 4 tools that apes used to get the food in the d1\ncondition (Friedman test:x\n2 = 38.88, df = 3, p,0.001); d2 (Fried-\nman test: x2 = 34.59, df = 3, p,0.001); d3 condition (Friedman\ntest: x2 = 40.80, df = 3, p,0.001) and d4 condition (Friedman test:\nx2 = 42.75, df = 3, p,0.001). In all conditions, subjects showed a\npreference for using the longest out of reach tool (Wilcoxon test:\nd1 T = 0.00, p = 0.008, n = 9; d2: T = 3.00, p,0.001, n = 15; d3:\nT = 0.00, p,0.001, n = 15; d4: T = 0.00, p,0.001, n = 15) (see\nFigure 6). A comparison of the average length of the tool selected\nin each condition revealed a significant increase in tool length as a\nfunction of the distance to the reward (Friedman test:x\n2 = 12.63,\ndf = 3, p,0.004, mean cm. (SEM): d1 = 50.73 (0.66), d2 = 50.84\n(0.82), d3 = 51.71 (0.67), d4 = 53.07 (0.36)).\nErrors. Similar to the sequential trials, we also examined if in\nthe correct trials, subjects’ performance was perfect or whether it\ncontained errors. Subjects’ correct responses contained more\nerrors than lack of them in d1 (Wilcoxon test: T = 0.00, p,0.001,\nn = 15; mean % (SEM): perfect = 1.48 (1.01); errors = 98.51 (1.01))\nand d3 (Wilcoxon test: T = 3.50, p,0.001, n = 15; mean % (SEM):\nperfect = 21.57 (5.01); errors = 78.42 (5.01)). In contrast, subjects’\nperformance in d2 was always perfect. There were no significant\ndifferences between perfect performance and performance with\nerrors in d4 trials (Wilcoxon test: T = 22.50, p = 0.375, n = 11;\nmean % (SEM): perfect = 54.71 (5.66); errors = 42.27 (5.66)). Next\nwe compared perfect performances in the correct sequential trials\nand Length-only trials. We found that there were no significant\ndifferences in perfect performances between d4 and Quinary\n(Wilcoxon test: T = 27.50, p = 0.390, n = 12; mean % (SEM):\nd4 = 54.71 (5.66); Quinary = 40.98 (8.47)). Perfect responses\noccurred more often in d2 than Secondary-any (Wilcoxon test:\nT = 0.00, p,0.001, n = 12; mean % (SEM): d2 = 100.00 (0.00);\nSecondary-any = 51.04 (8.11)), between Quaternary than d3\n(Wilcoxon test: T = 17.50, p = 0.070, n = 13; mean % (SEM):\nd3 = 21.57 (5.01); Quaternary = 52.54 (7.07)) and in Primary than\nd1 (Wilcoxon test: T = 0.00, p,0.001, n = 15; mean % (SEM):\nd1 = 1.48 (1.01); Primary = 81.47 (5.90)).\nDiscussion\nAll fifteen subjects reached for the out-of-reach tools in the\nLength-only trials and thirteen out of fifteen subjects did so in the\nsequential trials. Subjects used up to 5 tools in a sequence. They\nperformed better in the Length-only trials than in the sequential\ntrials in those conditions in which the food was not reachable by\nthe 20 cm within-reach tool. Similar to Experiment 1, subjects’\nsuccess in the sequential trials was determined by the complexity of\nthe task; in fact, their performance was significantly diminished in\nthe Quaternary and Quinary trials, in which subjects were\nrequired to use 4 and 5 tools, respectively, in a sequence to\nsuccessfully retrieve the reward.\nAs in Experiment 1, we examined whether subjects attended to\nthe position of the food by analyzing whether their first probe with\nthe 20 cm tool was aimed at the out-of-reach tools or at the food.\nThe results confirm our previous findings; that is, subjects used the\nimmediately available tool to extract tools more often in all the\nsequential trials than in the Primary trials, in which the food was\nreachable with the 20 cm tool. Therefore, subjects were able to\nadjust their first probing actions to the distance of the reward and\ntaking into account this information for further actions.\nFigure 6. Mean % of first out-of-reach tool used in the sequential and length-only trials (Experiment 2) [Error bars represent the\nstandard error of mean].\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0052074.g006\nSequential Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e52074\nWhen we compared subjects’ performance in the sequential tool\ntrials with their corresponding trials in the Length-only condition,\nwe found that, except for subjects’ performance in d1 and Primary\ntrials, subjects’ overall success was significantly better for all the\nLength-only trials than sequential trials. Thus, using tools in\nsequence imposed certain cognitive demands that resulted in a\ndiminished performance compared to the Length-only trials. In\nfact, a closer look at subjects’ performance showed that perfect\nresponses tended to occur when only one tool was required to\nobtain the reward (e.g. Primary trials). Similar to Experiment 1,\nsubjects were able to solve the Secondary-any on the very first\ntrial. It is also remarkable that nine out of twelve subjects solved\nthe Quaternary task on the first trial and five subjects did so in the\nQuinary condition. These results are noteworthy since apes were\nnot previously trained on the task.\nSimilar to Experiment 1, Experiment 2 demonstrated that apes\nwere sensitive to the distance of the food on the platform since they\nreached more often for the out-of-reach tools when the food was\nplaced at a farther distance than when it was placed at a closer\ndistance. As in Experiment 1, we also found that when the food\nwas positioned at an intermediate distance (d2), subjects tended to\nfirst try to retrieve the food with the immediate available tool.\nHowever, subjects reached for the out-of-reach tools more often in\nthe Secondary-any condition than in the Primary condition. Thus,\nas the distance to the food increased, the likelihood of subjects first\ntrying to reach for the out-of-reach tools increased.\nDo apes use such information to select the appropriate out-of\nreach tool? We did find that subjects’ tool choices varied across the\ndifferent experimental trials. In fact, our results showed that in the\nSecondary-any condition apes tended to choose more often the\n25 cm and 35 cm tools than the longer out-of-reach tools (45 cm\nor 55 cm long tools). Likewise, they retrieved and used the 45 cm\ntool more often than any of the other out-of-reach tools in the\nQuaternary condition. Subjects used the 45 cm and 55 cm tools to\ntry to reach for the food in Quinary condition; however they did\nnot use the longest out-of-reach more often in this condition. In\ncontrast, subjects’ performance in the Length-only trials followed a\ndifferent pattern: apes selected the 45 cm and 55 cm long tools\nindependently of the distance at which the food was placed. This\nfinding confirms the results from Experiment 1.\nIn contrast to Experiment 1, in the sequential trials and Length-\nonly trials we found a significant increase in tool length apes used\nas a function of the distance to the reward. This result is\nnoteworthy for two reasons. First of all, it confirms that adding\ncosts at retrieving the tools has an effect on tool selectivity. Second,\neven though there was no cost associated with choosing the 55 cm\ntool in the Length-only condition, we found that apes used such\ntool more often when the reward was farther away from them than\nwhen the reward was placed at a closer distance. One possibility is\nthat the way in which the trials were presented affected subjects’\nperformance. Whereas in Experiment 1, we presented subjects\nwith the sequential trials first and then with the Length-only trials,\nin Experiment 2 we intermixed both types of trials. Such\nprocedural modification could have affected apes’ tool choices\nand facilitated more tool selectivity. Another possibility is that apes\ncould potentially be selective even when there were no high costs\ninvolved at retrieving tools. However this is in contrast with the\nresults from the sequential trials. Moreover, a closer look at the\nrange of tools that apes used in both sequential and Length-only\ntrials helps to shed light on this issue. Whereas in the Length-only\ntrials apes’ choices mainly oscillated between the 45 cm and 55 cm\ntools, in the sequential trials apes were more selective depending\non the distance at which the reward was placed; that is, they\ntended to use 25- and 35-cm tools when the food was closer to\nthem and 45- and 55-cm tools when the reward was farther away.\nA closer inspection at the errors made in the correct responses\nsupports the idea that when reaching for tools is costly, apes\nbecome more selective. Similar to the results reported in\nExperiment 1, ‘‘perfect’’ performances occurred more often in\nthe Primary trials than in d1 trials. In the Primary trials when the\ncosts of reaching for the longer out-of-reach tools were increased,\napes tended to be more selective and used the 20-cm tool more\noften than when the out-of-reach tools were within subjects’ reach.\nThe opposite was true for the Secondary-any trials: when the\nlonger out-of-reach tools were more costly to get, subjects tried to\nreach for the food more often with the 20 cm tool than with the\nout-of-reach tools. Additionally, our results showed that subjects\nmade more mistakes in the Secondary-any than in d2 trials.\nAltogether these results provide strong support for the idea that\nincreasing the costs associated with retrieving the tools significantly\naffects subjects’ tool selection responses. In other words, apes\nexhibited tool selectivity when not doing so was costly.\nGeneral Discussion\nApes used up to 3 tools or 5 tools in sequence to obtain an out-\nof-reach piece of food. Subjects were able to solve the task\nrequiring the use of two tools in sequence on the very first trial\n(Secondary-any and Secondary-long conditions) and adopted the\nuse of more than two tools in sequence only after a few trials.\nNevertheless, subjects’ performance was better when no sequential\ntool-use was required to get the food (i.e. Length-only trials)\ncompared to when sequential tool use was required. Experiment 1\nshowed that subjects had a preference for using the longer out-of-\nreach tools even when a shorter tool sufficed to reach the reward.\nHowever, the results from Experiment 2 showed that increasing\nthe costs of reaching for longest out-of-reach tool made apes more\nselective at choosing tools. So that their tool choices matched more\nclosely the distance at which the food was located.\nWith regard to the aim of establishing comparisons across\nvarious species, our results confirm and extend previous findings\non sequential tool-use in great apes [7,8,12]. Similar to Mulcahy\net al.’s study [8], apes used tools sequentially in a spontaneous\nmanner. This is in contrast with the study by Rensch & Dohl [12],\nin which the chimpanzee received several pre-training sessions\nbefore she was able to use 5 tools in sequence. In the sequential\ntrials (Experiment 1) and Length-only trials (Experiment 1 & 2),\napes showed an overall preference for the longer tools regardless of\nwhether a shorter tool could also be used to get the reward. Similar\nto Mulcahy et al’s study [8], we also found that this preference\nchanged when the costs of retrieving the longer out-of-reach tools\nwere increased. In those trials in which the longer tool was\nunnecessary, apes tended to use either the short tool that was\nwithin reach or the shorter out-of-reach tools. We found no\nevidence of interspecific differences in sequential tool use even\nthough bonobos, unlike chimpanzees and orangutans, do not\nregularly use tools in the wild. Mulcahy et al. [8] also found no\ndifferences between orangutans and gorillas, even though gorillas\ndo not use tools in the wild.\nBeyond primates, apes, just like New Caledonian crows, probed\nfor the out-of-reach tools use on the first trial, even though none\nhad been given previous training on the different steps of the\nproblem. In contrast with the crows, however, apes were faster at\nsolving the different types of trials. Whereas the crows solved the\nSecondary-any on the fourth and the Secondary-long on the fifth\ntrial, apes did that on their very first trial. Even though our\nsubjects did not solve the Tertiary condition significantly above\nchance on the first trial, they were able to solve it faster than the\nSequential Tool Use\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 December 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 12 | e52074\ncrows. In fact, most of the crows solved the Tertiary condition in\nan additional block of trials that they received after all the 54 trials\nwere over (note that apes were not presented with this additional\nblock of trials). Apes, like crows, directed more of their first probes\ntowards tools when the food was further away, demonstrating that\nprobing for tools was not simply a result of frustration at their\ninability to retrieve food. Similar to the crows, apes also showed a\ntendency for using longer out-of-reach tools in the sequential trials\n(Experiment 1). Apes, like crows, used longer tools to probe for\nfood in Length-only, compared to Sequential trials.\nWimpenny et al. [1] argued that in order to qualify as goal-\ndirected, tool-extraction should only occur when required (i.e.\nwhen the length of the within-reach tool is not long enough to\nreach for the food or when there is food on the platform).\nWimpenny et al. [1] also argued that if probing for food was goal-\ndirected, subjects should not probe on the food-platform neither in\nthe Non-food nor the No-tools conditions. Since our subjects\nalmost never probed with the tools when there was no food on the\nplatform and they extracted more tools when it was required than\nwhen there was no need for tool extractions (i.e. Primary, No-\ntools), this suggests that apes exhibited goal-directed behavior. In\ncontrast, Wimpenny et al. [1] found that even though crows\nshowed flexibility in their behavior, by extracting tools on fewer\ntrials when they were unnecessary, they still probed into the food-\nframe when food was absent, or could not be obtained.\nDespite being able to use tools sequentially and successfully\nretrieve the reward, apes’ correct performance, just like crows’,\nwas not perfect. In fact, subjects performed worse in the Sequential\ntrials compared to the Length-only trials. Several reasons could\nexplain this finding. One possibility is that the sequential condition\ntaxed apes’ attentional resources. Whereas in the Length-only\ntrials subjects could succeed by retrieving the longer tool, subjects\nin the Sequential trials not only had to recognize and respond to\nthe depth of food, but they also had to decide whether to retrieve\nan additional tool. This may have divided their attention, a process\nthat could have affected their performance [23]. Additionally, the\nextra effort required to obtain multiple tools in sequential trials\ncompared to Length-only trials may have also contributed to the\nerrors observed. However, this cannot be the whole explanation\nbecause errors also occurred in Length-only trials.\nAnother possibility is that apes could not encode and/or\nremember the precise distance at which the food was placed and\nrelate it to the size of the tools that they could choose from. Instead\nsubjects used a strategy based on selecting the longest tool\navailable regardless of the distance at which the food was located\n[8,22,24]. This strategy has three main advantages. First, it insures\nsuccess in every trial. Second, since all the out-of-reach tools were\nevenly aligned in all conditions except the Tertiary condition, it\nmeans that the costs of extracting any of the out-of-reach tools\nwere exactly the same. Third, it bypasses the problem of having to\nencode the distance of the reward in relation to the lengths of the\ntools. Subjects could simply compare tools and select the longest\none.\nHowever, subjects’ responses in the Secondary-long and\nTertiary trials of Experiment 1 do not fit the ‘‘select the longest\ntool available’’ rule. Instead, apes might have used a rule based on\nusing the longest immediately available out-of-reach tool to get for\nthe food; but if this is not successful then extract the next longest\ntool’’. This would have allowed them to succeed by using the\n55 cm tool in all but the Tertiary condition; and in the latter they\nwould have first used the 45 cm tool since it was the longest\nimmediately available tool. The failure at retrieving the food with\nthe 45 cm tool would have forced them to retrieve the backwards-\ndisplaced 55 cm tool and use it to successfully reach for the food.\nThus, this heuristic rule could explain subjects’ performance in\nExperiment 1. However, this rule cannot explain subjects’\nresponses in Experiment 2. More specifically, if apes were using\nsuch procedural rule, in the Quaternary condition they should\nhave used the 35 cm tool more often than the 45 cm because such\ntool was the immediately available tool after the 25 cm. However\nthis is not what we found.\nLikewise, the results from Experiment 2 also indicated that\nsubjects’ performance showed a different pattern depending on the\ncosts involved in retrieving the out-of-reach tools: if the costs of\nreaching for the longest tool were increased, apes stopped\nextracting the longer out-of-reach tools when a shorter one suited\nthe task requirements. That is, presenting apes with a more\ndemanding task revealed that subjects were indeed capable of\nencoding the distance to the reward in relation to the length of the\ntools available. In general, these results mirror those showing that\nmaking a task more demanding can, in some cases, contribute to\nuncover abilities thought to be beyond apes’ grasp [25,26].\nAltogether the results reported here demonstrate that apes were\nable to perform multiple steps of a complex behavioral sequence\nand, consequently, act in a goal-directed manner by using a tool to\naccess as many out-of-reach tools as necessary in order to get a\nreward. Likewise, differences in performance in the different types\nof sequential trials together with subjects’ better performance in\nthe length only trials also indicate that the complexity and\ncognitive demands (e.g. level of anticipatory planning or hierar-\nchically organized behavior) involved in sequential tool use,\nincreased with the number of steps necessary to achieve the final\noutcome. Such finding is also congruent with the Wimpenny et al.\n[1]’s results in their equivalent experiment with New Caledonian\ncrows. The methodological extension presented here also sheds\nlight on tool selectivity in great apes. Increasing the cost of\nreaching for the longest tool showed that apes could be selective at\nchoosing tools. The findings of the present studies also contribute\nto the growing body of research revealing great apes also use tools\nto act upon another object. Extending these findings (Experiment\n2) to other species (e.g. New Caledonian crows) would also be\ncrucial to understand not only which mechanisms drive tool-use\nbehavior but also under which conditions tool-use behavior\nevolved.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: GM-O JC.
