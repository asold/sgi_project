  "abstract": "Abstract Skin cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Dermatologists often face challenges such as heavy data demands, potential human errors, and strict time limits, which can negatively affect diagnostic outcomes. Deep learning–based diagnostic systems offer quick, accurate testing and enhanced research capabilities, providing significant support to dermatologists. In this study, we enhanced the Swin Transformer architecture by implementing the hybrid shifted window-based multi-head self-attention (HSW-MSA) in place of the conventional shifted window-based multi-head self-attention (SW-MSA). This adjustment enables the model to more efficiently process areas of skin cancer overlap, capture finer details, and manage long-range dependencies, while maintaining memory usage and computational efficiency during training. Additionally, the study replaces the standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in the Swin Transformer with a SwiGLU-based MLP, an upgraded version of the gated linear unit (GLU) module, to achieve higher accuracy, faster training speeds, and better parameter efficiency. The modified Swin model-base was evaluated using the publicly accessible ISIC 2019 skin dataset with eight classes and was compared against popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and cutting-edge vision transformer (ViT) models. In an exhaustive assessment on the unseen test dataset, the proposed Swin-Base model demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy of 89.36%, a recall of 85.13%, a precision of 88.22%, and an F1-score of 86.65%, surpassing all previously reported research and deep learning models documented in the literature.",
