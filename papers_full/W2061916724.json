A\nlonger review is given in [12], a shorter one in [13]. We check in this note\nto what extent the results of the mean ﬁeld approximation are conﬁ rmed by\nagent-based simulations with many individuals. We do not talk here abo ut\nthe learning of languages [14, 15].\nThe Abrams-Strogatz diﬀerential equation for the competition of a lan-\nguage Y with higher social status 1 − s against another language X with\nlower social status s is\ndx/ dt = (1 − x)xas − x(1 − x)a(1 − s) (1)\nwhere a ≃ 1. 3 [1] and 0 < s ≤ 1/ 2. Here x is the fraction in the population\nspeaking language X with lower social status s while the fraction 1 −x speaks\nlanguage Y. As initial condition we consider the situation in which both\nlanguages have the same number of speakers, x(t = 0) = 1 / 2. Figure 1\nshows exponential decay for a = 1 . 31 as well as for the simpler linear case\na = 1. For s = 1 / 2 the symmetric situation x = 1 / 2 is a stationary solution\n1\n 1e-10\n 1e-09\n 1e-08\n 1e-07\n 1e-06\n 1e-05\n 1e-04\n 0.001\n 0.01\n 0.1\n 1\n 0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100\nDifferential equation: a = 1.31 (+,*) and a = 1 (x,sq.) for s = 0.1 (+,x) and s = 0.4 (*,sq.)\nFigure 1: Fraction of X speakers from Abrams-Strogatz diﬀerent ial equation\nwith a = 1 . 31 and a = 1, at status s = 0 . 1 (left) and s = 0 . 4 (right). For\na = 1 . 31 the decay is faster than for a = 1.\nwhich is stable for a < 1 and unstable for a > 1. From now on we use a = 1.\nThis simpliﬁcation makes the resulting diﬀerential equation\ndx/ dt = (2 s − 1)(1 − x)x (2)\nfor s ̸= 1 / 2 similar to the logistic equation which was applied to languages\nbefore, as reviewed by [16]. For s = 1 / 2 any value of x is a marginally stable\nstationary solution.\nThis diﬀerential equation is a mean-ﬁeld approximation, ignoring the f ate\nof individuals and the resulting ﬂuctuations. We now put in N individuals\nwhich in the fully connected model feel the inﬂuence of all individuals, while\non the d-dimensional lattice they feel only the inﬂuence of their 2 d nearest\nneighbors. The probability p to switch from language Y to language X, and\nthe probability q for the inverse switch, are\np = xas, q = (1 − x)a(1 − s) .

The\nthick horizontal line corresponds to s = 0 . 5 and N = 10 6 and changes away\nfrom 1/2 only for much longer times. Figs. 2 and 3 use one sample only\nand thus indicate self-averaging: The ﬂuctuations decrease for in creasing\npopulation.\nOn a lattice, this x is replaced by the fraction of X speakers in the neighbor-\nhood of 2 d sites. We use regular updating for most of the results shown in\nthis paper. Initially each person selects randomly one of the two lang uages\nwith equal probability: x(t = 0) = 0 . 5. In the symmetric situation s = 1 / 2\nwith a = 1 that we will consider, our later lattice model becomes similar to\nthe voter model [17].\nFig.2 shows our results for the fully connected case and Fig.3 for the\nsquare lattice with four neighbours; the results are quite similar to e ach\nother and to the original diﬀerential equation. A major diﬀerence w ith the\ndiﬀerential equation (1) is seen in the symmetric case s = 1 / 2 when the two\n3\n 1e-08\n 1e-07\n 1e-06\n 1e-05\n 1e-04\n 0.001\n 0.01\n 0.1\n 1\n 0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100\nfraction\ntime\nSquare lattice, L = 101 (+), 301 (x), 1001(*), 3001 (sq.); missing for 10001; s=.4 (lines: .3, .2, .1)\nFigure 3: L × L square lattice with L = 101 to 3001 at s = 0 . 4. The three\nleft lines correspond to s = 0 . 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 from left to right for L = 3001. The\nthick horizontal line corresponds to s = 0 . 5.\nlanguages are completely equivalent. Then the diﬀerential equation has x\nstaying at 1/2 for all times, while random ﬂuctuation for ﬁnite popula tion\ndestabilize this situation and let one of the two languages win over the other,\nwith x going to zero or unity.\nThis latter case can be described in a uniﬁed way by looking at the num-\nber of lattice neighbours speaking a language diﬀerent from the cen ter site.\nIt corresponds to an energy in the Ising magnet and measures micr oscopic\ninterfaces. Initially this number equals d on average, and then it decays\nto zero, ﬁrst possibly as a power law, and then exponentially after a time\nwhich increases with increasing lattice size, Fig.4. The ﬁrst decay des cribes\na coarsening phenomenon, while the exponential decay is triggered by ﬁnite\nsize ﬂuctuations. In one dimension the initial decay follows a power law ,\nt− 1/2, while in three dimensions an initial plateau is reached. This is followed\nby an exponential decay in d = 1 , 3 as in two dimensions, Fig.5.

A semilogarithmic plot, not shown, indicates a simple exponent ial\ndecay. Figs.4-6 average over 100 samples.\nshows that the average of |x(t) − 1/ 2| increases in two dimensions roughly\nas the square-root of time until it saturates at 1/2, indicating ran dom walk\nbehavior. (Note that ﬁrst averaging over x and then taking the absolute\nvalue | < x > −1/ 2| would not give appropriate results since < x > would\nalways be 1/2 apart from ﬂuctuations.)\nIn all the simulations described above, we went through the populat ion\nregularly, like a typewriter on a square lattice, and for full connect ivity kept\nthe probabilities constant within each iteration. Using random updat ing is\nmore realistic but takes more time. The long-time results are similar, a nd the\npower-law decay holds for t < 102 with exponents 0.5 for d = 1 (Fig. 5), and\n0.1 (compatible with 1 / ln t) for d = 2. For d = 3 a plateau is also reached.\nFor the simpler regular updating we checked when the fraction x, initially\n1/2, leaves the interval from 0.4 to 0.6 on its way to zero or one, Fig.7 a. For\n5\nthe random updating we checked when the energy reaches a small f raction of\nits initial value, taken as 2 /L , 0 . 04 and 0 . 6 for d = 1 , 2, 3, Fig.7. Both ﬁgure\nparts are quite similar, with scaling laws for the characteristic time wh ich are\ncompatible with the ones obtained for a voter model [17]: τ ≃ N2 in d = 1,\nτ ≃ N ln N in d = 2, and τ ≃ N in d = 3, where N = Ld.\nWe conclude that agent-based simulations diﬀer appreciably from th e\nresults from the mean-ﬁeld approach for the symmetric case s = 1 / 2: While\nEqs.(1,2) then predict x to stay at x = 1 / 2, our simulations in Fig.4 and\nlater show that after a decay everybody speaks the same languag e. In a\nfully connected network and in d = 3 the decay is triggered by a ﬁnite size\nﬂuctuation, while in d = 1 , 2 the intrinsic dynamics of the system causes an\ninitial ordering phenomena in which spatial domains of speakers of th e same\nlanguage grow in size.\nWe acknowledge ﬁnancial support form the MEC(Spain) through pr oject\nCONOCE2 (FIS2004-00953).\nReferences\n[1] D.M.
