Introduction \nLanguage Acquisition (LA) represents one of the most complex cognitive \nprocesses in human development, particularly in the realm of Vocabulary Learning \n(VL) [1,2]. This study presents a novel approach to understanding English Vocabulary \nAcquisition (EVA) by integrating two traditionally separate domains: the \nbiomechanics of Speech Production (SP) and computational modeling through Large \nLanguage Models (LLM). While previous research has often treated these aspects in \nisolation, this study  posits that the ph ysical constraints of speech production \nsignificantly affect EVA patterns and can be effectively modeled using advanced \ncomputational methods [3]. The complexity of EVA extends beyond mere \nmemorization, involving the intricate interplay between cognitive p rocessing and \nphysical articulation [4]. Traditional approaches to studying EVA have primarily \nfocused on cognitive and psychological aspects, often overlooking the crucial role of \nspeech biomechanics [5]. Recent advances in articulatory phonetics and motor control \nresearch have revealed that physical constraints in SP may significantly influence the \nease and efficiency of VL [6]. Simultaneously, the emergence of LLM has opened new \navenues for understanding and predicting LLM [7]. \nCITATION \nShang J.

Current \nresearch lacks comprehensive consideration of age-specific biomechanical constraints \nin VL. Furthermore, existing models fail to incorporate both physical and \ncomputational aspects of LA adequately. The field also suffers from a scarcity of \nlongitudinal studies e xamining the relationship between physical capabilities and \nlearning outcomes.  \nThe research objectives are:  \n• To quantify the relationship between articulatory biomechanics and EVA across \ndifferent age groups. \n• To develop and validate an integrated model incorporating biomechanical \nconstraints and LLM. \n• To examine how age-related differences in speech-motor control influence VL. \n• To evaluate the effectiveness of LLM in predicting learning outcomes when \nenhanced with biomechanical data. \nThis research contributes to both theoretical understanding and practical \napplications in LA. From a theoretical perspective, the study develops a unified \nframework combining biomechanical and computational approaches, enhancing our \nunderstanding of age-specific constraints in LLM while providing new insights into \nthe role of motor control in EVA. The practical implications extend to improved \nlanguage teaching and assessment methodologies, developing age -appropriate \nlearning strategies, enhanced computational models for predicting learning outcomes, \nand better tools for identifying and addressing learning difficulties. The study focuses \non EVA among Mandarin Chinese speakers in Shenzhen, China, encompassing three \nage groups: children (8 –12 years), adolescent s (13 –17 years), and adults (18 –25 \nyears). While the findings may have broader implications, the specific linguistic \ncontext should be considered when generalizing results. The research spans 12 weeks, \nallowing for observing immediate learning outcomes and  retention patterns. Our \napproach uniquely combines high -precision articulatory measurements with LLM \nanalysis, developing age-specific biomechanical profiles within a novel computational \nframework. Integrating physical constraints with LLM represents a si gnificant \nadvancement in understanding EVA. The longitudinal nature of the study allows for a \ncomprehensive assessment of learning outcomes across different age groups and \nlearning contexts. \nThe remainder of this paper presents a comprehensive literature review in section \n2 and a theoretical framework in section 3, followed by detailed methodology and data \ncollection procedures in section 4. The research design and analysis methods are \nthoroughly explained, leading to the presentation of results in section 5 across multiple \ndimensions. Section 6 discusses implications and applications, concluding with \nrecommendations for future research.  \n2. Literature review \nThe study of EV A has evolved significantly over the past century, and several \ninfluential theoretical frameworks have marked it. Skinner’s [9] “Verbal Behavior” \nMolecular & Cellular Biomechanics 2025, 22(1), 699.  \n3 \npresented a behaviorist perspective, viewing VL as a process of habit formation \nthrough reinforcement. This view was fundamentally challenged by Chomsky’s [10] \ncritique, which emphasized innate language capabilities and cognitive mechanisms. \nKrashen’s [11] input hypothesis later proposed that EV A occur s primarily through \ncomprehensible input, making a crucial distinction between conscious learning and \nunconscious acquisition. Nation [12] developed a systematic framework for \nvocabulary instruction, introducing concepts of learning burden and the importance of \nrepeated exposure in vocabulary retention. \nRecent advancements in our understanding of speech biomechanics have been \ndriven by empirical studies using modern imaging and measurement techniques. \nBrowman and Goldstein’s [13] articulatory phonology framework established \nfundamental principles for unde rstanding how physical speech gestures relate to \nlinguistic units. Gick et al. [14] provided comprehensive insights into SP mechanisms \nthrough their work on articulatory phonetics and motor control. Perkell’s [15] research \non speech-motor control has illuminated how feedback mechanisms influence SP and \nEV A. \nThe emergence of LLM has opened new avenues for understanding LLM and \nEV A. Devlin et al. [16] introduced Bidirectional Encoder Representations from \nTransformers (BERT), demonstrating unprecedented capabilities in LLM \nunderstanding through bidirectional context processing. Brown et al. [17] showcased \nGPT-3’s emergent linguistic behaviors, revealing how LLM can capture complex \nlanguage patterns. Vaswani et al. [18] introduced the transformer architecture, which \nfundamentally changed LLM processing and has bec ome crucial for understanding \nsequential language learning. \nDespite these advances, significant gaps remain in our understanding of EV A. \nIntegrating biomechanical constraints with computational LLM remains largely \nunexplored. Most current LLMs do not account for the physical constraints of SP, \nwhich may limit their  ability to model human LA patterns accurately. Additionally, \nlongitudinal studies examining the relationship between articulatory development and \nvocabulary growth are scarce. \n3. Theoretical framework \n3.1. Speech biomechanics fundamentals \nThe biomechanics of SP represents a complex interplay of muscular \ncoordination and neural control. Articulatory phonetics, the foundation of SP, \ninvolves precise movements of the vocal apparatus, including the lips, tongue, soft \npalate, and larynx [19]. Th ese articulators work in concert to modulate airflow and \ncreate distinct speech sounds. Particularly crucial in this process, the tongue employs \nintrinsic and extrinsic muscles to achieve the fine -grained positioning necessary for \nphoneme production. Resea rch has shown that different phonemes require varying \ndegrees of muscular effort and coordination, potentially influencing the ease of \nacquisition of different vocabulary items.  \nMotor control in SP operates through a sophisticated feedback system \nincorporating feedforward and feedback mechanisms. The central nervous system \nmaintains internal models of speech movements, continuously updated through \nMolecular & Cellular Biomechanics 2025, 22(1), 699.  \n4 \nsensorimotor integration. These models enable rapid articulatory movement \nadjustment based on acoustic and proprioceptive feedback. Studies have demonstrated \nthat the efficiency of this Motor Control System (MCS) significantly impacts EV A, \nparticularly in terms of pronunciation accuracy and speech fluency. \nThe development of speech muscles in language learners follows a trajectory \ninfluenced by physiological maturation and learning experience. Young learners \nundergo significant changes in their vocal apparatus, affecting their ability to produce \ncertain sounds. This developmental process involves the strengthening and refining of \nmuscle control, particularly in the tongue and facial muscles. Research indicates that \nthe physical development of speech muscles correlates with EV A patterns, suggesting \nthat biomechanical constraints may influence the natural sequence of word learning. \n3.2. LLM relevant to VL \nModern language models employ sophisticated architectures that parallel certain \naspects of human language processing. Token embedding and representation form the \nfoundational layer of these models, where words or sub-word units are converted into \nhigh-dimensional vectors. These embeddings capture semantic and syntactic \nrelationships between vocabulary items, creating a computational analog to the mental \nlexicon. Recent advances in embedding techniques have incorporated phonological \nfeatures, allowing models to account for sound-based relationships between words. \nAttention mechanisms in LLM serve as computational analogs to human \nselective attention in language processing. These mechanisms enable models to \ndynamically weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence, similar to \nhow humans focus on relevant linguistic features during EV A. Multi-head attention, \nin particular, allows models to simultaneously process different aspects of LLM, from \nphonological patterns to semantic relationships. \nPattern recognition capabilities in LLM extend beyond simple statistical \ncorrelations to capture complex linguistic phenomena. These models can identify \nrecurring patterns in phonological sequences, morphological structures, and semantic \nrelationships. Adv anced architectures incorporate hierarchical pattern recognition \nsystems that may mirror the layered processing observed in human LA. Recent \nresearch suggests these pattern recognition mechanisms can be aligned with \nbiomechanical constraints to better model human VL patterns. \nIntegrating biomechanical considerations with LLM represents a novel approach \nto understanding EV A. This framework allows for analyzing how physical constraints \nin SP might influence the learning trajectory predicted by computational models. \nFurthermore, considering cognitive and biomechanical factors in EV A, this integrated \napproach provides insights into potential optimization for language teaching \nmethodologies. \n4. Methodology \n4.1. Population and sampling \nThe study was conducted in Guangdong Province, China, specifically in \nShenzhen. A total of 51 participants were recruited, stratified across three age groups: \nMolecular & Cellular Biomechanics 2025, 22(1), 699.  \n5 \nchildren (ages 8–12, n = 17), adolescents (ages 13–17, n = 17), and adults (ages 18 –\n25, n = 17). All participants were native Mandarin Chinese speakers, with Cantonese \nas a common second language in their linguistic environment. The participants’ prior \nlanguage exposure to English varied: children had an average of 2.3 years of formal \nEnglish instruction through the Chinese education system, adolescents had 5.7 years, \nand adults had 8.4 years. Educational backgrounds were documented: children were \nall enrolled in primary education, adolescents in secondary education, and adults were \nuniversity students or recent graduates with varying majors. \nThe sample size of 51 participants was determined based on statistical and \npractical considerations. A power analysis using G*Power 3.1 was conducted, \nassuming a medium effect size ( f = 0.25), α = 0.05, and power (1 − β) = 0.80 for \nrepeated measures ANOV A with 3 groups and 6 measurement points [20]. The \nminimum required sample size was calculated to be 42 participants. The final sample \nsize of 51 (17 per group) was chosen to account for potential attrition and to ensure \nbalanced groups [21–25]. \nInclusion/exclusion criteria inclusion criteria: \n• Age within specified ranges for each group; \n• Native Mandarin Chinese speaker; \n• Normal or corrected-to-normal vision; \n• There is no reported history of speech or language disorders; \n• Regular enrollment in English language classes; \n• Resident of Shenzhen for at least two years. \nExclusion criteria: \n• History of neurological disorders; \n• Significant hearing impairment; \n• Extended (> 6 months) residence in English-speaking countries; \n• Bilingual proficiency in languages other than Mandarin and Cantonese; \n• Current participation in intensive English training programs outside regular \nschooling; \n• Previous participation in similar research studies. \nWritten informed consent was obtained from all adult participants and \nparents/guardians of minor participants, with additional assent from minors. All \nparticipants were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time \nwithout penalty —data col lection procedures adhered to privacy regulations, with \npersonal identifiers removed during data analysis and storage [26–33]. Compensation \nwas provided through educational materials and a modest stipend (¥200) for \nparticipation time. \nRecruitment methods: \nParticipants were recruited through a multi-channel approach in Shenzhen: \n1) Primary and secondary schools:  \n• Collaboration with three local public schools; \n• Information sessions for parents and students; \n• Distribution of recruitment flyers through school channels. \n2) University campus:  \n• Announcements on university bulletin boards; \nMolecular & Cellular Biomechanics 2025, 22(1), 699.  \n6 \n• Social media posts on university networks; \n• Direct contact through language departments. \n3) Community centers:  \n• Posters in community centers; \n• WeChat community groups; \n• Local education forums. \nThe recruitment process spanned 2 months, with initial screening conducted via \nonline forms and in -person verification of eligibility criteria. A stratified sampling \napproach was used to ensure equal representation across age groups and gender \nbalance within each group (Table 1). \nTable 1.

Speech recording and analysis infrastructure \nData was collected in a sound -treated laboratory room at Shenzhen University, \nwith ambient noise below 30 dB. High -fidelity acoustic recordings were captured \nusing a Shure SM7B microphone and a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 audio interface, \noperating at a 44.1 kH z sampling rate with 24 -bit depth. To ensure a comprehensive \nanalysis of speech articulation, high -speed video recordings were simultaneously \ncaptured using a Sony RX100 VII camera operating at 240 frames per second. The \ncamera was positioned at a 45°  angl e to optimize the capture of lip and jaw \nmovements, with precise synchronization achieved through timecode markers \nMolecular & Cellular Biomechanics 2025, 22(1), 699.  \n7 \naligning all data streams. \n4.2.2. Biomechanical data acquisition and processing \nThe study employed Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA) using the NDI \nWave system  to obtain detailed measurements of articulatory movements. Seven \nsensors were strategically placed to track key articulatory points: upper and lower lips, \ntongue tip, tongue body, tongue dorsum, and mouth corners ( Table 1). The system \noperated at a 100 Hz sampling rate, with head movements corrected using three \nreference sensors positioned at the left mastoid, right mastoid, and nation. \nComplementing the EMA data, surface electromyography (sEMG) measurements \nwere collected using the Delsys Trigno wireless EMG system, targeting four primary \nmuscle groups involved in SP. The sEMG data was sampled at 2000 Hz, with electrode \nplacement following standardized Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non -Invasive \nAssessment of Muscles (SENIAM) guidelines (Table 2). \nTable 2.

Biomechanical speech patterns \nAnalysis of Tables 11 –14 revealed significant age -related differences in \narticulatory kinematics, muscle activation patterns, motor control efficiency, and \nlearning outcomes across the study population ( N = 51, age groups: children 8 –12 \nyears, adolescents 13–17 years, adults 18–25 years). All measurements are presented \nMolecular & Cellular Biomechanics 2025, 22(1), 699.  \n11 \nas mean values with standard deviations, and statistical significance was established \nat p < 0.05. The Coefficient of Variation (CV) was used to assess timing stability, while \nmotor effort was calculated as integrated EMG activity over time. \nAs shown in Table 11 and Figure 1, articulatory kinematics demonstrated a clear \ndevelopmental trajectory across age groups. Children showed significantly larger \nmaximum tongue displacements (14.3 ± 2.1 mm) compared to adolescents (12.8 ± 1.7 \nmm) and adults (11.2 ± 1.4 mm) (F = 15.23, p < 0.001), indicating more exaggerated \nmovements during SP. Similar patterns were observed in average velocity \nmeasurements, with children exhibiting higher velocities (156.7 ± 18.4 mm/s) \ncompared to adults (134.8 ± 13.2 mm/s)  (F = 12.45, p < 0.001). Movement duration \nanalysis revealed that children required significantly more time (187.4 ± 22.3 ms) to \ncomplete articulatory gestures compared to adults (148.6 ± 15.4 ms) ( F = 18.76, p < \n0.001), suggesting less efficient motor control. \nTable 11.

Phonological errors were most frequent, with \nchildren showing the highest occurrence rate (34.5 ± 4.2%) compared to adults (18.7 \n± 3.1%). Notably, self-correction rates improved substantially with age across all error \ntypes, with adults demonstrating the highest self -correction rate for phonological \nerrors (78.2 ± 7.2%) and requiring the least time to correct (2.1 ± 0.3 seconds). \nSemantic errors showed similar patterns but lower overall occurrence rates across all \nage groups. Retention rates analyzed in Table 17 demonstrate a clear temporal decay \npattern over the 12 weeks. While all groups showed perfect retention at Week 1 \n\nMolecular & Cellular Biomechanics 2025, 22(1), 699.  \n15 \n(baseline), the decay rate varied significantly by age. Children exhibited the steepest \ndecline, reaching 67.8 ± 7.1% retention by Week 12, while adults maintained higher \nretention rates (84.9 ± 5.3%). The most substantial drop in retention occurred between \nWeeks 4 and 6 across all age groups, suggesting a critical period for vocabulary \nconsolidation. Table 18 reveals the impact of word complexity on EV A success, \nshowing significant differences across complexity levels and age groups. For low -\ncomplexity words, adults achieved the highest EV A success rate (94.2 ± 4.3%) with \nthe shortest learning duration (1.9 ± 0.3 days). The impact of complexity was most \npronounced in children, where high -complexity words showed markedly lower EV A \nsuccess (58.6 ± 7.1%) and r equired more extended learning periods (7.8 ± 0.9 days). \nThe retention rate followed a similar pattern, with high-complexity words showing the \nlowest retention across all age groups, particularly in children (52.3 ± 6.2%). \nTable 16.

Cross-age group comparative analysis. \nLearning difficulty prediction performance, detailed in Table 24 and Figure 9, \nreveals strong capabilities across different difficulty types. Phonological difficulty \npredictions showed the highest precision for adults (0.912 ± 0.028) with strong Area \nunder the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC) values (0.918), while \nchildren’s predictions maintained lower but still significant precision (0.842 ± 0.038, \nROC-AUC: 0.858). Semantic difficulty predictions demonstrated similar patterns but \nslightly lower overall performance metrics across all age grou ps. The impact of \nbiomechanical constraint integration, analyzed in Table 25 , shows significant \nimprovements in model performance. Advanced integration yielded substantial \nprediction enhancements, particularly for children (18.7 ± 2.2%), with corresponding \nerror reduction (22.4 ± 2.5%) and improved correlations (r = 0.856). The impact was \nless pronounced but still significant for adults, with advanced integration, showing \n14.2 ± 1.7% prediction enhancement and reduced Mean Square Error (MSE) (0.098). \n\nMolecular & Cellular Biomechanics 2025, 22(1), 699.  \n22 \nTable 26 reveals the computational trade -offs of biomechanical integration. \nWhile model accuracy improved significantly with bio-integration (children: 76.5% to \n88.9%, adults: 87.8% to 95.6%), this came at the cost of increased prediction time and \nresource usage. P rediction time increased more substantially for children (−21.6%) \ncompared to adults (−17.4%), while RAM usage increased similarly across all age \ngroups (approximately −37%). Despite these computational costs, improving \nprediction accuracy suggests the val ue of incorporating biomechanical constraints. \nThese findings demonstrate that while the LLM shows overall robust performance in \npredicting EV A patterns, its effectiveness varies by age group and improves \nsignificantly with the integration of biomechanical  constraints, albeit at the cost of \nincreased computational resources. The model’s performance is consistently better for \nadult learners, suggesting opportunities for refinement in modeling younger learners’ \nEV A patterns. \n6. Conclusion and future work \nThis study has demonstrated the significant impact of biomechanical constraints \non EVA and the value of integrating these factors into computational LLM. We have \nestablished vital findings that advance our understanding of LLM through the \ncomprehensive ana lysis of articulatory patterns, muscle activation, and learning \noutcomes across different age groups. The research revealed substantial age -related \ndifferences in SP mechanics, with younger learners exhibiting significantly higher \nmuscular effort and less efficient MCS. These biomechanical variations strongly \ncorrelate with EVA success, particularly in learning rate and retention. They were \nintegrating biomechanical data into LLM analysis markedly improved prediction \naccuracy, though with associated computational costs. These findings have important \nimplications for language teaching and learning. The strong relationship between \nmotor complexity and learning outcomes suggests the need for age -specific teaching \napproaches considering physical development stag es. The enhanced predictive \ncapabilities of biomechanically -informed LLM offer new possibilities for \npersonalized learning strategies and early identification of potential learning \ndifficulties. Several limitations of this study warrant consideration. The specific \nlinguistic context of Mandarin Chinese speakers learning English may limit \ngeneralizability to other language pairs. The 12 -week duration, while sufficient for \nobserving initial learning patterns, may not fully capture long -term retention effects. \nAdditionally, the computational demands of integrated biomechanical -linguistic \nanalysis present challenges for real-time applications. \nFuture research should explore longer -term longitudinal studies, broader \nlinguistic contexts, and more efficient computational methods for integrating \nbiomechanical data. Investigating intervention strategies based on biomechanical \nprofiles could provide v aluable insights into language education. Developing more \nresource-efficient integration methods for biomechanical constraints in LLM \nrepresents an important direction for future work. This study represents a significant \nstep toward understanding the complex interplay between the physical and cognitive \naspects of LLM. The demonstrated value of incorporating biomechanical constraints \ninto computational models opens new avenues for research in LA and pedagogical \nMolecular & Cellular Biomechanics 2025, 22(1), 699.  \n23 \ndevelopment. \nFunding: This research was funded by the General Project of Scientific Research \nCultivation Projects of Zhongyuan Institute of Science and Technology in 2023, “A \nComparative Study on English-Chinese Translation in the Context of ‘Chinese Culture \nGoing Global’”, Grant Number 28. \nEthical approval: Not applicable. \nConflict of interest: The author declares no conflict of interest. \nReferences \n1.
