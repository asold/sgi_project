  "abstract": "A large language model (LLM) is constructed to address the sophisticated demands of data retrieval and analysis, detailed well profiling, computation of key technical indicators, and the solutions to complex problems in reservoir performance analysis (RPA). The LLM is constructed for RPA scenarios with incremental pre-training, fine-tuning, and functional subsystems coupling. Functional subsystem and efficient coupling methods are proposed based on named entity recognition (NER), tool invocation, and Text-to-SQL construction, all aimed at resolving pivotal challenges in developing the specific application of LLMs for RDA. This study conducted a detailed accuracy test on feature extraction models, tool classification models, data retrieval models and analysis recommendation models. The results indicate that these models have demonstrated good performance in various key aspects of reservoir dynamic analysis. The research takes some injection and production well groups in the PK3 Block of the Daqing Oilfield as an example for testing. Testing results show that our model has significant potential and practical value in assisting reservoir engineers with RDA. The research results provide a powerful support to the application of LLM in reservoir performance analysis.",
