    "abstract": "The scarcity and class imbalance of training data are known issues in current\\nrumor detection tasks. We propose a straight-forward and general-purpose data\\naugmentation technique which is beneficial to early rumor detection relying on\\nevent propagation patterns. The key idea is to exploit massive unlabeled event\\ndata sets on social media to augment limited labeled rumor source tweets. This\\nwork is based on rumor spreading patterns revealed by recent rumor studies and\\nsemantic relatedness between labeled and unlabeled data. A state-of-the-art\\nneural language model (NLM) and large credibility-focused Twitter corpora are\\nemployed to learn context-sensitive representations of rumor tweets. Six\\ndifferent real-world events based on three publicly available rumor datasets\\nare employed in our experiments to provide a comparative evaluation of the\\neffectiveness of the method. The results show that our method can expand the\\nsize of an existing rumor data set nearly by 200% and corresponding social\\ncontext (i.e., conversational threads) by 100% with reasonable quality.\\nPreliminary experiments with a state-of-the-art deep learning-based rumor\\ndetection model show that augmented data can alleviate over-fitting and class\\nimbalance caused by limited train data and can help to train complex neural\\nnetworks (NNs). With augmented data, the performance of rumor detection can be\\nimproved by 12.1% in terms of F-score. Our experiments also indicate that\\naugmented training data can help to generalize rumor detection models on unseen\\nrumors.\\n",
