INTRODUCTION\nPower transformers represent the vital power system equip-\nment. The accurate diagnostic accuracy of transformer faults\nis an important topic for power system reliability and con-\ntinuity. The early detection of transformer faults is bene-\nﬁcial in planning the maintenance schedule and avoiding\nunscheduled load curtailment and ﬁre hazards. Nowadays,\ntransformers operate near their full capacity due to rapid\nincrease of load demand. This leads to an increase in the\nelectrical, thermal and chemical stresses on the transformer\ninsulation [1], [2]. The stresses can incept faults inside the\ntransformer such as overheating, partial discharge, and arc-\ning. Lack of proper diagnosis of these faults can cause severe\ndamage and eventual failure of the transformer. Therefore,\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Diego Oliva\n.\nseveral methods were proposed for accurate fault diagno-\nsis in transformers based on the analysis of insulating oil.\nDissolved gas analysis (DGA) is the most used method for\nfault diagnosis [3], [4]. DGA is based on the correlation\nbetween dissolved gases in the oil and corresponding fault\ntype and severity. The most common faults in transformers\nare classiﬁed into six types that are partial discharge (PD),\nlow energy discharge (D1), high energy discharge (D2), low\ntemperature fault (T1), medium temperature fault (T2), and\nhigh temperature fault (T3). The most common dissolved\ngases generated under these faults are ﬁve combustible gases;\nhydrogen (H 2), methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2H6), ethylene\n(C2H4) and acetylene (C 2H2). In addition, there are two other\ngases responsible for diagnosing degradation of cellulose\ninsulation. These gases are carbon monoxide and carbon\ndioxide. Since cellulose degradation is speciﬁc in its gas\ngeneration, it can be dealt separately by diagnostic methods.\n139176 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Hoballahet al.: HGWO for Transformer Fault Diagnosis Using Dissolved Gases\nMany conventional methods were proposed to identify the\ntransformer faults based on DGA such as key gas method [1],\nratio methods [5]–[7], and graphical methods [8]–[12]. Some\nof these methods were targeting diagnosis of main fault types\nin transformer oil and others were developed to include cel-\nlulose degradation. These conventional methods are limited\nin their diagnostic accuracy.\nArtiﬁcial intelligent methods were widely used to develop\nDGA based diagnosis with high accuracy. The ﬁrst example\nof these methods was the artiﬁcial neural network (ANN),\nin which much training data were used to adapt the network\nfor DGA diagnosis [13]–[16]. The input for ANN can be\nfuzziﬁed gas concentrations [13], certain gas ratios [14]–[16],\nor others [16], [17]. The second example of artiﬁcial intel-\nligent methods is the fuzzy logic system, in which several\nIf-Then rules were implemented to correlate DGA with the\nproper diagnosis [18]–[20]. Also, support vector machine\n(SVM) was proposed as an example of artiﬁcial intelligent\nmethods with a slight increase in the diagnostic accuracy\ncompared to others [21]–[23]. In addition, other artiﬁcial\nintelligent methods have been introduced to increase the\ndiagnostic accuracy such as adaptive neural fuzzy inference\nsystem [24], gene expression programming approach [25],\nand Bayesian networks [26].\nThe uncertainties and noises in measured DGA data affect\nstrongly the ability of DGA methods on transformer fault\ndiagnosis. In most methods, the diagnostic accuracy depends\non the numeric limits and the boundaries of gas contents\nwithin DGA data. Therefore, uncertainties associated with\nmeasured data may lead to serious deterioration in diagnostic\naccuracy, and consequently, these uncertainties should be\nconsidered during the evaluation process of the diagnostic\nmethod. In [27], two SVM based algorithms were developed\nusing fuzzy c-means clustering and kernel fuzzy c-means\nclustering methods to consider the possible noises, outliers\nand imbalances in measurements without producing clear\ncuring code or numeric validation. In addition, the tech-\nnique developed in [27] needs special programing, making\nit impractical for the engineers at transformer stations. Thus,\nmore investigations are required to develop clear and robust\nmethodology for accounting such uncertainties in measure-\nments.\nThis work aims to develop DGA based diagnostic method\nrobust against measurement uncertainties using fuzzy logic\nsystem and heuristic optimization techniques. The main tar-\nget is to create a tabulated code that relates the percentages\nof dissolved gases having different levels of measurement\nuncertainties to the fault type.\nThe problem is formulated as a constrained optimization\nproblem that need to be solved using heuristic optimiza-\ntion (HO) techniques. Hybrid Grey Wolf Optimizer (HGWO)\ntechnique was used to attain the global solution fast that\nachieves the best diagnostic accuracy. The fuzzy system\nis used to relate the actual percentages of gases with the\nfault types utilizing the membership functions for various\npercentages and the corresponding diagnostic rules. Then,\nHGWO technique is used to specify the division limits of\ngas percentages and the fault type aiming to maximize the\ndiagnostic accuracy. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle\nSwarm Optimization (PSO) was also used to validate that the\nobtained solution is the global one.\nA 407 datasets are used to test the proposed method. These\ndatasets were collected from Egyptian Electricity Utility and\nliteratures [28]–[31]. The obtained code is implemented con-\nsidering different degrees of uncertainties in the collected\ndatasets, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. The optimal limits of\ngas percentages are converted into code tree that can be\neasily used to specify the fault type. The results of the pro-\nposed method were compared to other methods to validate its\nrobustness against uncertainty.\nII. UNCERTAINTY AND RESEARCH MOTIVATION\nDGA based diagnostic methods of transformer faults are\nstrongly affected by the exact measurement and analysis of\ndissolved gases. Currently, the most adopted DGA process is\nthe ofﬂine one, which is composed of three main procedures.\nThe ﬁrst procedure is extracting the oil sample from the\nconsidered transformer. The second procedure is separating\nthe gas phases of the oil. The third and last procedure is diag-\nnosing the fault type by any relevant method. Oil sampling is\ncarried out using special syringes. Then, samples are stored\nand transferred to the laboratory for testing. During storage\nand transfer, many factors affect gas concentrations such as\ntemperature and storage time. Several techniques were used\nfor gas separation. The most critical factor that affects gas\nconcentrations during separation is the air bubbles. The exis-\ntence of air bubbles causes a signiﬁcant reduction in dissolved\ngases due to the diffusion of gases into the air bubble and\nleaving the oil [32]. All these factors act towards increasing\nuncertainties in input gas concentrations and reducing diag-\nnostic accuracy. So, it is important to consider these factors\nin developing any DGA based diagnostic method. According\nto [33], the storage and temperature can cause uncertainties\nup to ±14% and uncertainties due to measurement accuracy\nare within ±5%. Accordingly, overall uncertainties in DGA\ndata can be considered as ±20%.\nRegarding conventional DGA methods, they have already\nlimited accuracy. So, any further decrement in the accuracy\ndue to uncertainties in the input data will make these meth-\nods unpractical. For ANN, SVM, or any similar methods,\nthey tend to be a black box adapted for certain dataset.\nAccordingly, they lack a proper representation of uncertain-\nties. For fuzzy logic, it can accommodate a proper infras-\ntructure for dealing with uncertainties if proper membership\nfunctions have been built and enough rules has been imple-\nmented [34], [35]. To the best of our knowledge, none of the\nprevious DGA diagnostic methods considered uncertainties\nin their implementation.\nIII. PROPOSED METHOD\nAs discussed above, the fuzzy logic system can deal effec-\ntively with uncertainties in input data if proper membership\nVOLUME 8, 2020 139177\nA. Hoballahet al.: HGWO for Transformer Fault Diagnosis Using Dissolved Gases\nFIGURE 1. The proposed algorithm for new code preparation.\nfunctions have been built and sufﬁcient number of rules has\nbeen implemented. Accordingly, the main structure of the\nproposed method is built based on the fuzzy logic system.\nPercentages of the dissolved gas concentrations vector (R)\nin each dataset are used as input indices for predicting the\ncorresponding fault types (F) as follows:\nR =\n\n\n\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\nR5\n\n\n\n=100 ×\n\n\n\nH2\n/\nTCG\nCH4\n/\nTCG\nC2H6\n/\nTCG\nC2H4\n/\nTCG\nC2H2\n/\nTCG\n\n\n\n(1)\nTCG =H2 +CH4 +C2H6 +C2H4 +C2H2 (2)\nwhere, TCG is the total amount of dissolved combustible\ngases in the transformer oil.\nThe ﬁrst stage towards limiting the impact of uncertainties\nis the use of the percentage gas, where uncertainty value\nbecomes normalized by the overall concentration of the total\ncombustible gases. Different uncertainty levels were ran-\ndomly assumed in the input data up to 20% as declared in the\nprevious section. The uncertainty was generated by applying\na random error or noise vector to the original vector [36]. The\npercentage error (E ) can be expressed as follows:\nE =x ×r (3)\nwhere r is a random vector ranging between 0 and 1 and x\nis the required step of uncertainty levels, which is taken as\n5% in this study. This error is then added to an offset K to\nincrease the uncertainty level. As an example, if K is speciﬁed\nas 10%, the total uncertainty level after adding E will be 15%.\nDifferent degrees of uncertainties in the collected datasets are\nimplemented in this study ranging between 5% and 20% with\na step of 5%. Based on the error vector in (3), a new vector of\nuncertain data (U) is created as follows [37]:\nU =[1 ±(E +K)] ×R (4)\nThe original and modiﬁed data were combined together to\nform the input data to the proposed methodology. The ﬁve\ngas percentage values were used to specify the fault type. The\nproposed code was obtained by dividing each gas percentage\ninto three regions (three memberships) with the correspond-\ning two limits between 0% and 100% as shown in Fig. 1.\nTherefore, considering the ﬁve gas percentages and the limits\nof each gas percentage (0, RA, RB, 100), the membership\nlimits matrix (R L ) can be written as follows:\nRL =\n\n\n\n0 R1A R1B 100\n0 R2A R2B 100\n0 R3A R3B 100\n0 R4A R4B 100\n0 R5A R5B 100\n\n\n\n(5)\nThe ﬁve gas percentages with three ranges create 243 dif-\nferent rules which were used to build the membership func-\ntions of the fuzzy system. These rules represent the initial\noverall code matrix during the optimization process. Using\nthis large number of rules is intended to cover different\npossibilities of input-output combinations. Then, the datasets\nwere processed using the fuzzy logic system to estimate\nthe fault type, by representing the different regions of each\ngas concentration using membership functions. The fuzziﬁ-\ncation process is the second stage towards limiting uncer-\ntainties, where there will be a small shift in fuzziﬁed value\nafter uncertainty. So, any violation of a certain rule due\nto uncertainty will be compensated by other rules. Finally,\nHGWO was used for optimizing the limits of membership\nfunctions and the fault type corresponding to each rule\naiming to maximize the diagnostic accuracy considering\nboth original data and uncertain ones. GA and PSO algo-\nrithms were also used to guarantee attaining the optimal\nsolution.\nThe main steps of the proposed algorithm are pre-\nsented in Fig. 1. They contain three main processes as\nfollow:\nA. The original datasets were collected, and new datasets\nwere created based on the expected random uncertainty\n139178 VOLUME 8, 2020\nA.

Furthermore,\nthe percentages of the dissolved gas concentrations\nwere calculated in each set.\nB. Sugeno type fuzzy inference system (FIS) was used\nto relate the dissolved gas percentages and the fault\ntypes through set of rules which covering all available\ncombinations of membership functions with the limits\nspeciﬁed in Equation (5). HGWO was used to con-\ntinuously update the FIS by modifying the member-\nship limits and fault types corresponding to each rule\nin the direction of diagnostic accuracy maximization.\nTherefore, the actual percentages of the dissolved gas\nconcentrations (inputs) are used to determine the code\nmatrix (rules) based on the membership function lim-\nits, which were provided from the HGWO as shown\nin Fig. 2. The fault types are marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and\n6 to represent the fault types PD, D1, D2, T1, T2, and\nT3, respectively.\nC. The objective function (Accuracy) was calculated\nusing the percentage of the number of true estimated\nfault types by the proposed model (N true) and the total\nnumber of samples (N all). The sum of the width of\nmembership functions of each gas percentage must\nbe 100. The optimal limits of gas percentages were\nspeciﬁed by using the optimization process.\nIV. OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS\nThe problem was formulated as a constrained objective func-\ntion. Three optimization algorithms were used to obtain the\noptimal gas percentage limits, thereby formulating the code\ntree for accurate fault diagnosis. The ﬁtness function was the\ndiagnostic accuracy.\nMaximize :\nf (x)=100 ×Ntrue\n/\nNall (6)\nSubject to :\nRiA ≤RiB ≤100 i =1,2,... 5 (7)\nA.

Therefore, the algorithm was modiﬁed to enhance\nthe ability of GWO to settle at the optimal solution. Several\nmethods have been used to improve the convergence per-\nformance of the GWO [39]. Modiﬁcations were applied to\nimprove the ability of GWO to discover the search area and\nconverge at the optimal solution.\nB. HYBRID GREY WOLF OPTIMIZER (HGWO)\nHGWO with GA was developed to improve the exploration,\nthe exploitation and diversity [39]–[43]. In this work, addi-\ntional loop of PSO was added to keep the gained experience of\nthe HGWO with GA by memorizing the local best positions\nand global best position [30]. The individuals modify their\npositions using the velocity (v k+1) based on the distance\nbetween the position of individuals, their local best positions\n(xk\nlb) and global best position (x α).

Fittest individuals (parents) were used to\ngenerate new solutions (offsprings). The better individuals\nsurvive and represent new parents for the next iteration. The\nGA mechanism was applied on the local best positions gained\nby PSO individuals to keep diversity and discover new search\nareas around the best solution.

Each time, HGWO proved not only to\ncatch the optimal solution but also to be the fastest algorithm.\nThe same optimal solution was obtained by using the three\noptimization techniques with the same diagnostic accuracy.\nEquation (22) presents the obtained optimal limits of gas\npercentages and Table 3 presents the corresponding ranges\nof the membership functions.\nRL =\n\n\n\n0 31.68 51.62 100\n0 55.00 80.55 100\n0 18.09 24.98 100\n0 10.45 40.00 100\n0 02.45 76.69 100\n\n\n\n(22)\nFIGURE 3. Developed code tree formulation.\nAfter optimization process, the operating rules became\n39 rules formed in a code tree to specify the fault types in\nrelation to the ﬁve percentages of dissolved gas concentra-\ntions as shown in Fig. 3. The use of the code tree starts\nwith determining the code of R1 towards R5 based on the\nmembership limits at Table 3 and ends by the corresponding\nexpected fault type expressed as a code matrix. The overall\nfault diagnostic accuracy of the optimal solution was 96.95%\nconsidering both training and testing datasets. By analyzing\nthe code tree, the allocation of fault types with the actual\ndata without uncertainties belongs to 34 branches which\ncovers all fault types. This means that 5 fuzzy operating\nrules became operative to account for the uncertainty in\nmeasurements.\nAs a case study to illustrate step by step the usage of the\ncode tree, a sample of data was used with ﬁve gas values\nof 37800, 1740, 249, 8 and 8 corresponding to H 2, CH 4,\nC2H6, C2H4 and C2H2, respectively. The total dissolved gas\ncontents were 39805. The percentages of gases are 94.96%,\n4.37%, 0.625%, 0.02% and 0.02%, which, representing R1,\nR2, R3, R4 and R5, respectively. The fault diagnostic starts\nwith creating the code matrix corresponding to gas percent-\nages according to the limits in Table 3. The code matrix is\n[3 1 1 1 1] based on the membership limits. By tracking the\nbranch in the code tree starting from R1 at 3, R2 at 1, R3 at 1,\nR4 at 1 and R5 at 1, the branch ended by the corresponding\nfault type that can be easily found as partial discharge (PD)\nas shown in Fig. 4.

CASE STUDIES\nTable 4 illustrates the code matrix formulation for randomly\nselected ﬁve case studies from the original data representing\nvarious fault types. The code corresponding to each percent-\nage of dissolved gas concentration was obtained by compar-\ning the values with optimized membership limits in Table 3.\nThen, the obtained code matrix was used to specify the\nexpected fault type using code tree starting from the center\nat R1 towards the fault type as described above in Fig. 3. It is\nclear that the proposed method performs well for the original\ndatasets.\nThe ability of the proposed code to consider the uncer-\ntainties within input data was investigated at different levels.\nTwelve samples with uncertainty levels of 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%\nand 20% are considered as study cases. The data samples\nand corresponding fault types are presented in Table 5. It is\nclear that the impact of uncertainty in the overall diagnosis\nwas limited. The fault diagnosis using the proposed code tree\nwas correct in all cases except once where the fault changed\nfrom T2 to T3 within the same category of thermal fault\ntype.\nB. DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY\nFig. 6 presents the diagnostic accuracy of all fault types\nduring the training stage (1530 data samples) and testing\nstage (505 data samples) of the original data and uncertain\ndata for all fault types.

Fig. 9 presents a summary of\nthe diagnostic accuracies associated with different degree of\nuncertainties for general groups of faults, partial discharge\nfault, arcing or discharge fault, and thermal fault. It is clear\nthat the highest decrement in accuracy over the whole uncer-\ntainty range was only about 1.3% either for thermal or dis-\ncharge faults.\nC. VALIDATION AND COMPARISON\nThe ability of the proposed codes to correctly identify the\nfault type is examined in comparison with other methods.\nThese methods are ANN, Cluster method, IEC ratio method,\nDuval triangle, modiﬁed Rogers’4 ratio (ROG-MOD) [30],\nand modiﬁed IEC ratio [6]. As shown in Table 10, the\noverall diagnostic accuracy of the proposed method decre-\nmented from 100% to 93.12% with a variation of uncer-\ntainty from 0% to 20%, which is considered relatively\nlarge.\nThe diagnostic accuracies of the ROG-MOD method (the\nhighest accuracy among the comparison methods) decreased\nfrom 93.86% to 87.72% with uncertainty degree varied from\n0 to 20%. The accuracy over the whole range of uncertainty\ndegree of the other comparison methods was kept below that\nof the proposed method. Therefore, the proposed code tree\ncould be used to eliminate the impact of the high degree of\nuncertainties in measurements.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nThis work had been presented a framework to apply the\nHGWO optimizer technique in order to generate a new\ncode matrix for the power transformer fault diagnosis con-\nsidering the uncertainty associated with the measurements.\nThe GWO optimizer was modiﬁed by adding two loops\nof PSO and GA to improve the ability to divert and con-\nverge at the optimal solution. GA and PSO was additionally\nused separately to guarantee obtaining the global optimal\nsolution. The uncertainty in the measured data that orig-\ninated either during oil sampling or during storage and\ntransfer were considered up to 20% of the actual measured\ndata.\nThe developed code matrix succeeded to diagnose the fault\ntypes with a high accuracy of 100% for the original dataset as\nwell as 98.77%, 98.03%, 95.09% and 93.12% in the case of\nrandom uncertainty of 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively.\nThe proposed code matrix had high abilities to diagnose the\ntransformer fault types using simple codes and with high\ndegree of uncertainties in the measurements. The comparison\nbetween the proposed code matrix and other DGA methods\nsuch as ANN, Duval, IEC 60599 Code, Cluster, ROG-MOD\nand IEC-MOD methods proved its effectiveness and appli-\ncability in accurate fault diagnosis considering uncertain-\nties. The accuracies of the proposed code over the whole\nrange of uncertainty degree were higher than that of other\nmethods.\nREFERENCES\n[1] IEEE Guide for the Interpretation of Gases Generated in Mineral\nOil-Immersed Transformers, IEEE Standard C57.104-2008,\nFeb. 2009.\n[2] J.
