INTRODUCTION \nArtificial intelligence (AI), automation, and cloud -native \ndevelopment have all developed in convergence in recent \nyears, causing rapid evolution of software engineering. The \ngenerative AI, AI agents, and intelligent automation are \nfundamentally transformi ng the way organizations are \nconstructing, bringing into the field, and running software \nsystems. Such developments hold the promise not just of \nunprecedented speed and efficiency, but also of new \nreliability, scalability, and innovation paradigms of DevOps \npractices. Generative AI has propagated as a disruptive \ntechnology in DevOps processes in software engineering \n[1], [2]. The current innovations exhibit the use of AI-based \nsolutions to improve the efficiency of software deployment, \nmonitoring, and development [3], [4].  \nWith generative AI as part of the DevOps processes, it is \npossible to automate the previously manual and time -\nconsuming tasks, including code g eneration, infrastructure \nprovisioning, testing, monitoring, and incident response. AI \nagents can now assist developers and operations teams with \nintelligent suggestions, automatic routine maintenance and \neven the multifaceted deployment pipelines. Consequ ently, \norganizations are seeing a replacement of the conventional \nand reactive systems to self -healing and adaptive systems \nwhich are proactive. \nContainerization and orchestration platforms such as \nDocker and Kubernetes have emerged as the workhorse of \nthe modern software delivery, and are collectively known as \ncloud-native technologies. Used together with AI -powered \nautomation, such platforms enable the development of \nscalable, resilient, and efficient environments that can \nflexibly meet the evolving busin ess demands. AI -driven \ntools and algorithms are beginning to play a role in \nInfrastructure as Code (IaC), continuous integration and \ncontinuous deployment (CI/CD) and progressive delivery \nmodels. \nThis paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the \ncurrent state and future trajectory of generative AI, agentic \nworkflows, and automation in DevOps and cloud -native \ndevelopment. We synthesize insights from recent research \nand industry practice, identify key terms, theories, and \nalgorithms shaping the field, an d forecast major trends for \nthe years ahead. The structure of the paper is as follows: \n An overview of foundational concepts and terminology \nin AI-driven DevOps and automation. \n Analysis of top theories and algorithmic approaches \ncurrently influencing practice. \n Examination of automation in CI/CD pipelines, with a \nfocus on opportunities and cautions. \n A forward -looking perspective on anticipated \ndevelopments for 2026–2029. \nII.

There are several viable ways to  use \nGenerative AI to speed up DevOps and data management, \nincluding the appropriate safeguards in the form of \ncybersecurity [4]. According to research, AI is \nrevolutionizing DevOps by automation, enhanced \nproductivity, and better q uality of software throughout the \nSDLC [8]. \nMuch attention is paid to AI agents and their role in the \nwork of DevOps engineers and the ability to revolutionize \nthe DevOps field by offering intelligent solutions. The \nagents are also  being investigated to optimize Kubernetes \nperformance [17] and self-operating clouds [18], [19]. \nDeployment of AI models and applications is often \ndiscussed in the context of containerization technologies \nlike Docker and Kubernetes. This includes deploying AI \nmodels with FastAPI, Azure, and Docker [20], \ncontainerizing Python-based GenAI apps with Docker [21], \nand leveraging containers for deploying Generative AI \napplications [22]. Kubernetes is also highlighted for its role \nin AI/ML orchestration on platforms like Googl e Cloud \n[23] and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for AI model \ndeployment. Generative AI tools are simplifying \nKubernetes management [28], [29]. \nCloud platforms like Azure and AWS are enabling the use \nof generative AI, with Azure AI Foundry serving as a \ndevelopment hub for generative AI solutions and custom \ncopilots [30].
