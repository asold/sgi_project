Based\non the study, we successfully develop state-of-the-\nart models for multiple low-level tasks.\n1 Introduction\nImage pre-training has received great attention in computer\nvision, especially prevalent in object detection and segmenta-\ntion [Girshick et al., 2014; Girshick, 2015; Chenet al., 2017].\nWhen task-speciﬁc data is limited, pre-training helps mod-\nels see large-scale data, thus vastly enhancing their capabil-\nities. In the ﬁeld of high-level vision, previous work [Ko-\nrnblith et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2017; Mahajan et al., 2018;\nKolesnikov et al., 2020] has shown that ConvNets pre-trained\non ImageNet [Deng et al., 2009 ] classiﬁcation yield signiﬁ-\ncant improvements on a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.\nAs for image processing tasks, e.g., super-resolution (SR)\nand deraining, the widely used datasets typically contain only\na few thousand images, pointing out the potential of pre-\ntraining. However, its crucial role in low-level vision is com-\n\u0003Equal contribution\nmonly omitted. To the best of our knowledge, the sole pio-\nneer exploring this point is IPT [Chen et al., 2021 ]. Hence,\nthere still lacks principled analysis on understanding how pre-\ntraining acts and how to perform effective pre-training.\nPrevious image processing systems majorly leverage con-\nvolutional neural networks (CNNs) [LeCun et al., 1989 ].\nMore recently, transformer architectures [Dosovitskiy et al.,\n2020; Liu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a ], initially pro-\nposed in NLP [Vaswani et al., 2017], have achieved promis-\ning results in vision tasks, demonstrating the potential of us-\ning transformers as a primary backbone for vision applica-\ntions. Moreover, the stronger modeling capability of trans-\nformers allows for large-scale and sophisticated pre-training,\nwhich has shown great success in both NLP and computer\nvision [Radford et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et\nal., 2020; Devlinet al., 2018; Heet al., 2021; Liuet al., 2022;\nZamir et al., 2022; Chenet al., 2022]. However, it remains in-\nfeasible to directly exploit structure designs and data utiliza-\ntion on the full-attention transformers for low-level vision.\nFor example, due to the massive amount of parameters (e.g.,\n116M for IPT [Chen et al., 2021 ]) and huge computational\ncost, it is prohibitively hard to explore various pre-training\ndesign choices based on IPT and further apply them in prac-\ntice. Instead of following the full-attention pipeline, we ex-\nplore the other window-based variants [Liang et al., 2021;\nWang et al., 2021b ], which are more computationally ef-\nﬁcient while leading to impressive performance. Along\nthis line, we develop an encoder-decoder-based transformer\n(EDT) that is powerful yet efﬁcient in data exploitation and\ncomputation. We mainly adopt EDT as a representative for\nefﬁcient computation, since our observations generalize well\nto other frameworks, as shown in Sec. 3.4.\nIn this paper, we systematically explore and evaluate how\nimage pre-training performs in window-based transformers.\nUsing centered kernel alignment [Kornblith et al., 2019;\nCortes et al., 2012 ] as a network “diagnosing” measure, we\nhave designed a set of pre-training strategies, and thoroughly\ntested them with different image processing tasks. As a re-\nsult, we uncover their respective effects on internal network\nrepresentations, and draw useful guidelines for applying pre-\ntraining to low-level vision. The key ﬁndings and contribu-\ntions of this study can be summarized as follows,\n• Internal representations of transformers. We ﬁnd\nstriking differences in low-level tasks, e.g., SR and de-\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1089\nCB↓ CB↓\nTS\nCB CB\nHigh-Res.\nCB CB\nCB↑ CB↑\nUp\n⋯\nDeraining\nDenoising\n⋮\nSR\n⋮\nLow-Res. \n𝐻2×𝑊2 𝐻4×𝑊4 𝐻4×𝑊4 𝐻2×𝑊2\n𝐻𝑠×𝑊𝑠 𝐻𝑠×𝑊𝑠 𝐻𝑠×𝑊𝑠 𝐻𝑠×𝑊𝑠\n⋮\n⋮\n⨁\n⨁\nBilinear\n𝐻𝑠×𝑊𝑠\n𝐻×𝑊 𝐻×𝑊CBConvolution BlockTSTransformer StageUpUpsamplerBilinearBilinear InterpolationInput Output\nFigure 1: The proposed encoder-decoder-based transformer (EDT). It processes high-resolution (e.g., in denoising) and low-resolution (e.g.,\nin SR, sis the scale) inputs using different paths, modeling long-range interactions at a low resolution, for efﬁcient computation.\nraining models show clear stages, containing more local\ninformation in early layers while more global informa-\ntion in higher layers. The denoising model presents a\nrelatively uniform structure ﬁlled with local information.\n• Effects of pre-training . We ﬁnd that pre-training im-\nproves the model performance by introducing different\ndegrees of local information, treated as a kind of induc-\ntive bias, to the intermediate layers.\n• Pre-training guidelines . Examining different pre-\ntraining strategies, we suggest a favorablemulti-related-\ntask setup that brings more improvements and could be\napplied to multiple downstream tasks. Also, we ﬁnd this\nperforming strategy is more data-efﬁcient than purely in-\ncreasing the data scale. Besides, a larger model capacity\nusually gets more out of pre-training.\n• Transformers v.s. CNNs . We observe that both\ntransformers and CNNs beneﬁt from pre-training, while\ntransformers obtain greater improvements.\n• SOTA models. Based on the comprehensive study of\npre-training, we provide a series of pre-trained models\nwith state-of-the-art performance for multiple tasks, in-\ncluding super-resolution, denoising and deraining.\n2 Encoder-Decoder-Based Transformer\nSeveral transformers [Chen et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021;\nWang et al. , 2021b ] are tailored to low-level tasks, among\nwhich window-based architectures [Liang et al., 2021; Wang\net al. , 2021b ] show competitive performance under con-\nstrained parameters and computational complexity. Built\nupon the existing work, we make several modiﬁcations\nand present an efﬁcient encoder-decoder-based transformer\n(EDT) in Fig. 1. It achieves state-of-the-art results on mul-\ntiple low-level tasks (see Sec. 4), especially for those with\nheavy degradation. For example, EDT yields 0.49dB im-\nprovement in \u00024 SR on the Urban100 [Huang et al., 2015]\nbenchmark compared to IPT, while our \u00024 SR model size\n(11.6M) is only 10.0% of IPT (115.6M) and only requires\n200K images ( 15.6% of IPT) for pre-training. Also, our\ndenoising model obtains superior performance in level-50\nGaussian denoising, with 38 GFLOPs for 192 \u0002192 inputs,\nfar less than SwinIR [Liang et al., 2021] (451 GFLOPs), ac-\ncounting for only 8.4%. And the inference speed of EDT\n(51.9ms) is much faster than SwinIR (271.9ms). It should be\npointed out that designing a novel framework is not our main\npurpose. Noticing similar pre-training effects on transformers\nin Sec. 3.4, we adopt EDT for fast pre-training in this paper.\n2.1 Overall Architecture\nAs shown in Fig. 1, our EDT is composed of a lightweight\nconvolutional encoder and decoder as well as a transformer-\nbased body, for modeling long-range interactions.\nTo improve the encoding efﬁciency, images are ﬁrst down-\nsampled to 1=4 size with strided convolutions for tasks with\nhigh-resolution inputs (e.g., denoising or deraining), while\nbeing processed under the original size for those with low-\nresolution inputs (e.g., SR). The stack of early convolutions\nis also proven useful for stabling the optimization [Xiao et\nal., 2021]. Then, there follow multiple stages of transformer\nblocks, achieving a large receptive ﬁeld at a low computa-\ntional cost. It is noted that we improve the structure of trans-\nformer blocks through a series of ablations and provide more\ndetails in the supplementary ﬁle. During the decoding phase,\nwe upsample the feature back to the input size using trans-\nposed convolutions for denoising or deraining while main-\ntaining the size for SR. Besides, skip connections are intro-\nduced to enable fast convergence during training. In particu-\nlar, there is an additional convolutional upsampler before the\noutput for super-resolution.\n2.2 Architecture Variants\nWe develop four variants of EDT with different model sizes,\nrendering our framework easily applied in various scenarios.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1090\nModels EDT-T EDT-S EDT-B EDT-L\n#Channels 60 120 180 240\n#Stages 4 5 6 12\n#Heads 6 6 6 8\n#Param.\n(\u0002106, M) 0.9 4.2 11.5 40.2\nFLOPs (\n\u0002109, G) 2.8 12.4 37.6 136.4\nTable 1: Conﬁgurations of four variants of EDT. The parameter\nnumbers and FLOPs are counted in denoising at 192 \u0002192 size.\nAs shown in Table 1, apart from the base model (EDT-B),\nwe also provide EDT-T (Tiny), EDT-S (Small) and EDT-L\n(Large). The main differences lie in the channel number,\nstage number and head number in the transformer body. We\nuniformly set the block number in each transformer stage to\n6, the expansion ratio of the feed-forward network (FFN) to\n2 and the window size to (6;24).\n3 Study of Image Pre-training\n3.1 Pre-training on ImageNet\nFollowing [Chen et al., 2021], we adopt the ImageNet [Deng\net al., 2009 ] dataset in the pre-training stage. Unless spec-\niﬁed otherwise, we only use 200K images for fast pre-\ntraining. We choose three representative low-level tasks in-\ncluding super-resolution (SR), denoising and deraining. Re-\nferring to [Chen et al., 2021; Agustsson and Timofte, 2017;\nGu et al., 2017 ], we simulate the degradation procedure to\nsynthesize low quality images. In terms of SR, we utilize\nbicubic interpolation to obtain low-resolution images. As for\ndenoising and deraining, Gaussian noises (on RGB space)\nand rain streaks are directly added to the clean images. In this\nwork, we explore \u00022/\u00023/\u00024 settings in SR, 15/25/50 noise\nlevels in denoising and light/heavy rain streaks in deraining.\nWe explore three pre-training strategies: on a single task,\non unrelated tasks and on related tasks. (1) Single-task pre-\ntraining refers to training a single model on a speciﬁc task\n(e.g., \u00022 SR). (2) The second is to train a single model on\nmultiple yet unrelated tasks (e.g.,\u00022 SR, level-15 denoising),\nwhile (3) the last contains highly related tasks (e.g., \u00022, \u00023\nSR). Following[Chen et al., 2021], we adopt a multi-encoder,\nmulti-decoder, shared-body architecture for the latter two se-\ntups. The ﬁne-tuning is performed on a single task, where the\nmodel is initialized with the pre-trained task-speciﬁc encoder\nand decoder as well as the shared transformer body. Training\ndetails are provided in the supplementary ﬁle.\n3.2 Centered Kernel Alignment\nWe introduce centered kernel alignment (CKA)[Kornblith et\nal., 2019; Cortes et al., 2012; Raghu et al., 2021 ] to study\nrepresentation similarity of network hidden layers, support-\ning quantitative comparisons within and across networks. In\ndetail, given m data points, we calculate the activations of\ntwo layers X 2Rm\u0002p1 and Y 2Rm\u0002p2 , having p1 and p2\nneurons respectively. We use the Gram matrices K = XX>\nand L = YY>to compute CKA:\nCKA(K;L) = HSIC(K;L)\np\nHSIC(K;K)HSIC(L;L)\n; (1)\nwhere HSIC is the Hilbert-Schmidt independence crite-\nrion [Gretton et al., 2007]. Given the centering matrix H =\nIn \u00001\nn11>, K\n0\n= HKH and L\n0\n= HLH are centered\nGram matrices, then we have HSIC(K;L) = vec( K\n0\n) \u0001\nvec(L\n0\n)=(m\u00001)2. Thanks to the properties of CKA, invari-\nant to orthogonal transformation and isotropic scaling, we are\nable to conduct a meaningful analysis of neural network rep-\nresentations. However, naive computation of CKA requires\nmaintaining the activations across the entire dataset in mem-\nory, causing much memory consumption. To avoid this, we\nuse minibatch estimators of CKA[Nguyen et al., 2020], with\na minibatch of 300 by iterating over the test dataset 10 times.\n3.3 Representation Structure of EDT\nWe begin our investigation by studying the internal repre-\nsentation structure of our models. How are representations\npropagated within models in different low-level tasks? To an-\nswer this intriguing question, we compute CKA similarities\nbetween every pair of layers within a model. Apart from the\nconvolutional head and tail, we include outputs of attention\nand FFN after residual connections in the transformer body.\nWe observe a block-diagonal structure in the CKA similar-\nity maps in Fig. 2. As for the SR and deraining models in\nFig. 2 (a)-(b), we ﬁnd there are roughly four groups, among\nwhich a range of transformer layers are of high similarity.\nThe ﬁrst and last group structures (from left to right) corre-\nspond to the model head and tail, while the second and third\ngroup structures account for the transformer body. As for the\ndenoising task (Fig. 2 (c)), there are only three obvious group\nstructures, where the second one (transformer body) is domi-\nnated. Finally, from the cross-model comparison in Fig. 2 (d)\nand (h), we ﬁnd higher similarity scores between denoising\nbody layers and the second group SR layers, while showing\nsigniﬁcant differences compared to the third group SR layers.\nWe also explore the impact of single-task pre-training on\nthe internal representations. As for SR and deraining in Fig. 2\n(e)-(f), the representations of the model head and tail remain\nbasically unchanged. Meanwhile, we observe obvious repre-\nsentation changes in the transition regions between the sec-\nond and third groups. In terms of denoising in Fig. 2 (g), the\ninternal representations do not change too much, consistent\nwith the ﬁnding in Table 4 that denoising tasks obtain fewer\nimprovements, compared to SR and deraining tasks.\nKey Findings: (1) SR and deraining models show clear\nstages in the internal representations of the transformer body,\nwhile the denoising model presents a relatively uniform struc-\nture; (2) the denoising model layers show more similarity to\nthe lower layers of SR models, containing more local infor-\nmation, as veriﬁed in Sec. 3.4; (3) single-task pre-training\nmainly affects the intermediate layers of SR and deraining\nmodels but has limited impact on the denoising model.\n3.4 Single- and Multi-Task Pre-training\nIn the previous section, we observe that the transformer body\nof SR models is clearly composed of two group structures\nand pre-training mainly changes the representations of higher\nlayers. What is the difference between these two partitions?\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1091\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n(e) (g) (h)\n(f)\nSimilarity\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 1st 2nd 3rd\nFigure 2: Sub-ﬁgures (a)-(c) show CKA similarities between all pairs of layers in \u00022 SR, light streak deraining and level-15 denoising\nEDT-B models with single-task pre-training, and the corresponding similarities between with and without pre-training are shown in (e)-(g).\nSub-ﬁgure (d) shows the cross-model comparison between SR and denoising models and (h) shows the ratios of layer similarity larger than\n0.6 for input images, where “s” means the similarity between the current layer in SR and any layer in denoising.\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nSet5 Set14 Urban100 Manga109\nPSNR(dB) Improvement\n single\n multi-unrelated\n multi-related\nFigure 3: PSNR improvements of single-task, multi-unrelated-task\nand multi-related-task pre-training for EDT-B in \u00022 SR.\nHow does the pre-training, especially multi-task pre-training,\naffect the behaviors of models?\nWe conjecture that one possible reason causing the parti-\ntion lies with the difference of ability to incorporate local or\nglobal information between different layers. We start by an-\nalyzing self-attention layers for their mechanism of dynam-\nically aggregating information from other spatial locations,\nwhich is quite different from the ﬁxed receptive ﬁeld of the\nFFN layer. To represent the range of attentive ﬁelds, we aver-\nage pixel distances between the queries and keys using atten-\ntion weights for each head over 170,000 data points, where\na larger distance usually refers to using more global infor-\nmation. We do not record attention distances of shifted local\nwindows, because the shift operation narrows down boundary\nwindows and hence can not reﬂect real distances.\nAs shown in Fig. 4 (e)-(h), for the second group structure\n(counted from the head, same as Sec. 3.3), the standard devi-\nation of attention distances (shown as the blue area) is large\nand the mean value is small, indicating the attention mod-\nules in this group structure area have a mix of local heads\n(relatively small distances) and global heads (relatively large\ndistances). On the contrary, the third group structure only\ncontains global heads, showing more global information are\naggregated in this stage.\nCompared to single-task pre-training (\u00022 SR, Fig. 4 (b)\nand (f)), multi-unrelated-task setup (\u00022, \u00023 SR, g15 denois-\ning, in Fig. 4 (c) and (g)) converts more global representa-\ntions (in red box) of the third group to local ones, increasing\nthe scope of the second group. In consequence, as shown in\nFig. 3, we observe obvious PSNR improvements on all bench-\nmarks. When replacing the g15 denoising with highly related\n\u00024 SR (\u00022, \u00023, \u00024 SR, in Fig. 4 (d) and (h)), we observe\nmore changes in global representations, along with further\nimprovements in Fig. 3. The inferiority of multi-unrelated-\ntask setup is mainly due to the representation mismatch of un-\nrelated tasks, as shown in Sec. 3.3. We also provide detailed\nquantitative comparisons for all tasks and different batch size\nsettings in the supplementary material.\nKey Findings: (1) the representations of SR models contain\nmore local information in early layers while more global in-\nformation in higher layers; (2) all three pre-training methods\ncan greatly improve the performance by introducing different\ndegrees of local information, treated as a kind of inductive\nbias, to the intermediate layers of the model, among which\nmulti-related-task pre-training performs best.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1092\n(a)\n (b)\n (d)\n(c)\n(e) (f) (h)(g)\nSimilarity\nFigure 4: Sub-ﬁgures (a)-(d) show CKA similarities of \u00022 SR models, without pre-training as well as with pre-training ona single task (\u00022),\nunrelated tasks (\u00022, \u00023 SR, g15 denoising) and highly related tasks (\u00022, \u00023, \u00024 SR).

Without pre-training,\nthe ﬁrst few blocks (1-15) tend to be local while the last ones\n(16-18) are more global. And pre-training brings more local\nrepresentations, matching our observation before.\n3.5 Effect of Data Scale on Pre-training\nIn this section, we investigate how pre-training data scale af-\nfects the super-resolution performance. As shown in Table 2,\nModel Data Set5 Set14\nUrban100 Manga109\nEDT-B 0 38.45 34.57\n33.80 39.93\nEDT-By 50K 38.53 34.66\n33.86 40.14\nEDT-By 100K 38.55 34.68\n33.90 40.18\nEDT-By 200K 38.56 34.71\n33.95 40.25\nEDT-By 400K 38.61 34.75\n34.05 40.37\nEDT-B? 200K 38.63 34.80\n34.27 40.37\nTable 2: PSNR(dB) results of different pre-training data scales in\u00022\nSR. “EDT-By” refers to the base model with single-task (\u00022 SR)\npre-training and “EDT-B?” represents the base model with multi-\nrelated-task (\u00022, \u00023, \u00024 SR) pre-training.\nwith regard to the EDT-B model, we obviously observe incre-\nmental PSNR improvements on multiple SR benchmarks by\nincreasing the data scale from 50K to 400K during single-task\npre-training. It is noted that we double the pre-training itera-\ntions for the data scale of 400K so that the data can be fully\nfunctional. However, a longer pre-training period largely in-\ncreases the training burden.\nOn the contrary, as shown in Table 2, multi-related-task\npre-training (with much fewer training iterations) success-\nfully breaks through the limit. Our EDT-B model with multi-\nrelated-task pre-training on 200K images achieves new state\nof the arts on all benchmarks, though a smaller data scale is\nadopted, revealing that simply increasing the data scale may\nnot be the optimal option. Thus, we suggest multi-related-\ntask pre-training is more effective and data-efﬁcient.\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1093\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\nSet5 Set14 Urban100 Manga109\nPSNR(dB) Improvement\nDataset\n EDT-T\n EDT-S\n EDT-B\n EDT-L\nFigure 6: PSNR improvements of four variants of EDT models using\nsingle-task pre-training in \u00022 SR. “T”, “S”, “B” and “L” refer to\ntiny, small, base and large models.

As shown in Fig. 6, we visualize PSNR improvements\nof models with pre-training over counterparts trained from\nscratch. It is observed that models with larger capacities gen-\nerally obtain more improvements. Especially, we ﬁnd pre-\ntraining can still improve a lot upon already strong EDT-L\nmodels, showing the potential of pre-training. The quantita-\ntive results are provided in the supplementary ﬁle.\nHere we visualize the CKA maps of the EDT-S, EDT-B\nand EDT-L models in Fig 7. As illustrated in Sec. 3.3, we\nalready know there are roughly four group structures in the\nCKA maps of SR models, among which the second and third\ngroup structures account for the transformer body. The pro-\nportion of the third part is positively correlated with the model\nsize. Especially, compared to the other two, the third group\nstructure of EDT-L account for the vast majority and show\nhigh similarities, which reﬂects the redundancy of the model.\n3.7 EDT v.s. ConvNets with Pre-training\nWe further explore the pre-training performance of EDT\nand CNNs-based models (RRDB [Wang et al., 2018 ] and\nRCAN [Zhang et al., 2018b ]). Fig. 8 demonstrates that our\nEDT-B obtains greater or comparable improvements from\npre-training, giving higher baselines with fewer parame-\nters. From the representation comparisons between EDT and\nCNNs-based models exhibited in the supplementary material,\nwe argue that the superiority of transformers may come from\nthe utilization of global information.\n33.27 \n33.33 33.34 \n33.44 \n33.80 \n33.95 \n33.00\n33.20\n33.40\n33.60\n33.80\n34.00\nW/o Pre-training W/ Pre-training\nUrban100\n39.61 \n39.86 \n39.79 \n40.05 \n39.93 \n40.25 \n39.40\n39.60\n39.80\n40.00\n40.20\n40.40\nW/o Pre-training W/ Pre-training\nManga109\nRRDB (16.7M) RCAN (15.4M) EDT-B (11.5M)\nPSNR(dB)\nPSNR(dB)\nFigure 8: Quantitative comparison between ConvNets (RRDB and\nRCAN) and our EDT-B without (“W/o”) and with (“W/”) single-\ntask pre-training in \u00022 SR.\n4 Experiments\nFollowing the pre-training guidelines, we conduct experi-\nments in super-resolution (SR), denoising and detraining.\nAs aforementioned, we observe that multi-related-task pre-\ntraining is highly effective and data-efﬁcient. Thus, we adopt\nthis pre-training strategy in all the tests. The involved pre-\ntraining tasks of SR include \u00022, \u00023 and \u00024, those of denois-\ning include g15, g25 and g50, and those of deraining include\nlight and heavy rain streaks. More experimental settings and\nvisual comparisons are given in the supplementary ﬁle.\n4.1 Super-Resolution Results\nFor the super-resolution (SR) task, we test our models on two\nsettings, classical and lightweight SR, where the latter gen-\nerally refers to models with < 1M parameters. The results\nof \u00023 classical SR and lightweight SR are provided in the\nsupplementary material due to the space limit.\nWe compare our EDT with state-of-the-art CNNs-based\nmethods as well as transformer-based methods. As shown in\nTable 3, while the proposed EDT-B serves as a strong base-\nline, achieving nearly 0.1dB gains on multiple datasets over\nSwinIR [Liang et al., 2021 ], pre-training still brings signiﬁ-\ncant improvements on \u00022 and \u00024 scales. For example, we\nobserve up to 0.46dB and 0.45dB improvements on high-\nresolution benchmark Urban100 and Manga109, manifesting\nthe effectiveness of our pre-training strategy.\n4.2 Denoising Results\nIn Table 4, we present our three models: (1) EDT-B without\npre-training; (2) EDT-B with pre-training; (3) EDT-B without\ndownsampling and pre-training.\nIt is worthwhile to note that, unlike SR models that ben-\neﬁt a lot from pre-training, denoising models only achieve\n0.02-0.11dB gains. One possible reason is that we use a large\ntraining dataset in denoising tasks, which already provides\nsufﬁcient data to make the capacity of our models into full\nplay. On the other hand, pre-training hardly affects the in-\nternal feature representation of models, discussed in Sec. 3.3.\nTherefore, we suggest that the Gaussian denoising task may\nnot need a large amount of training data.\nBesides, we ﬁnd our framework is well performed on high\nnoise levels (e.g., \u001b = 50), while yielding slightly inferior\nperformance on low noise levels (e.g., \u001b = 15). This could\nbe caused by the downsampling operation in EDT. To ver-\nify this assumption, we train another EDT-B model without\ndownsampling. As shown in Table 4, it does obtain better\nProceedings of the Thirty-Second International Joint Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI-23)\n1094\nScale Method #Param.

Nonetheless, we sug-\ngest that the proposed EDT model is still a good choice for\ndenoising tasks since it strikes a sweet point between per-\nformance and computational complexity. For example, the\nFLOPs of EDT-B (38G) is only 8.4% of SwinIR (451G).\n4.3 Deraining Results\nWe evaluate the performance of our EDT on Rain100L[Yang\net al., 2019] and Rain100H [Yang et al., 2019] two datasets,\naccounting for light and heavy rain streaks. As shown in Ta-\nble 5, though the model size of our EDT-B (11.5M) for de-\nraining is far smaller than IPT (116M), it still outperforms\nIPT by 0.52dB on the light rain setting. Meanwhile, our\nmodel reaches signiﬁcantly superior results by 2.66dB gain\non the heavy rain setting, compared to the second-best RCD-\nNet [Wang et al., 2020], supporting that EDT performs well\nfor restoration tasks with heavy degradation.\n5 Conclusion\nBased on the proposed framework, we perform an in-depth\nanalysis of transformer-based image pre-training in low-level\nvision.
