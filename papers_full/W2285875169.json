The lifelong autoregulatory loop of tra female-specific splicing can be reset by the\nintervention of male-specific primary signals ( M factor). In early development, the functional female and truncated\nmale TRA proteins relay the sexual fates to the alternative splicing of a bisexual switch gene, doublesex (dsx)\ncascading the sexual differentiation processes. Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) and Bactrocera correcta (Bezzi) are among\nthe Bactrocera model worldwide key pests. Area-wide integrated pest management using the male-only Sterile\nInsect Technique (SIT) relying on genetic sexing systems is effective in control programs. We undertook the\nmolecular characterization and comparative studies of the tra orthologues in the Bactrocera species, including the\nSalaya1 genetic sexing strain (GSS).\nResults: RT-PCR revealed that B. dorsalis tra (Bdtra) and B. correcta tra (Bctra) transcripts contained conservation of\nboth constitutive exons and male-specific exons as in other Bactrocera. However, new Bdtra male-specific exons\nwere retained, diversifying the pattern of the male-specifically spliced transcripts. The coding sequences of tra were\nhighly conserved in Bactrocera (86–95 %) but less so among related genera (61 –65 %) within the same Tephritidae\nfamily. A conservation of deduced amino acid sequences (18 residues), called the TEP region, was identified to be\ndistinctive among tephritids. The 5 ’ regulatory sequence containing many structural characteristics of the putative\ncore promoter was discovered in B. correcta. The expression patterns of Bdtra and Bctra were sex-specifically spliced\nand the signals relayed to the dsx genes in the adult wild-types. However, the coexistence of male- and female-\nspecifically spliced transcripts (980 and 626 bp, respectively) of the B. dorsalis wild-type strain was found in the\nSalaya1 GSS adult males. The Bdtra RNA interference masculinized the XX karyotype females into pseudomales, but\ntheir testes were mostly not well developed.\nConclusions: Bdtra and Bctra have sex-specific splicing, similar to Bactroceras, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), and\nAnastrephas. A newly identified TEP region is proposed in tephritids. A putative core promoter has been discovered\nin Bctra.\nKeywords: Oriental fruit fly, Guava fruit fly, Tra core promoter, Alternative splicing, Genetic sexing strain\n* Correspondence: sujinda.tha@mahidol.ac.th\nDepartment of Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University, Rama\nVI Road, Bangkok 10400, Thailand\n© 2016 Laohakieat et al.

BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 \nDOI 10.1186/s12863-016-0342-0\nBackground\nEukaryotic sexual reproduction is an important bio-\nlogical process for the continuity of life. Meiosis provides\ndiverse gametes which can be reunited through sexual\nselection and fertilization. The progeny, endowed with a\nsuitable genome, are naturally selected before the next\nround of mating. The male and female developmental\ndimorphism is fundamental for the existence of sexual\ncharacteristic [1].\nThe sex determination of insects is one of the most\nwell-known system [2, 3]. There are several mecha-\nnisms that determine the sexual fate among insect\nmodels [3, 4]. The primary signals convey genetic in-\nstruction to the sex determination switches in order\nto designate and sustain sexual identity during devel-\nopment and throughout an organism ’s life [3, 4]. In\nvery early embryonic development (approximately be-\nfore the blastoderm cellularization), an upstream\nregulator is usually required to be established as a\nstable genetic switch that serves as a device memory\nfor sex-specific cell fate [5 – 15].\nIn Drosophila melanogaster , the primary signal is com-\nposed of proteins encoded by a group of genes linked to\nthe X-chromosome, called X-linked signal elements\n(XSE) [16, 17]. Their encoded proteins interact with the\nother group of proteins encoded by autosomally local-\nized genes to generate sex-specific dosages (XX/AA or\nXY/AA) [17, 18]. These dosages regulate the transcrip-\ntion of Sex-lethal (Sxl), upstream regulator, which is also\nan X-linked gene that presents in both sexes. However,\nonly the XX/AA female dosage can activate the early\nfemale-specific promoter of the Sxl gene. This early\nfemale-specific SXL protein is a sex-specific splicing\nregulator of the later promoter Sxl pre-mRNA. The sec-\nondary SXL protein can autoregulate the female-specific\nsplicing of its own pre-mRNA [17 – 20] and the subordi-\nnated control gene as transformer (tra) to maintain fe-\nmale development [21, 22]. In contrast, with males, the\nabsence of early SXL protein leads to the production of\nmale-specifically spliced Sxl transcripts which incorpor-\nate in-frame stop codons, resulting in the truncated\nmale-specific SXL protein [19, 23].\nIn Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), a tephritid fruit fly,\nthe primary signal is an uncharacterized male-deter-\nminer M (M factor) but was only mapped on a Y-\nchromosome [24]. The M factor was proposed to regu-\nlate the tra gene, in C. capitata [6, 7, 25]. It was postu-\nlated that the M factor inhibited the maternal TRA\nprotein, which is required for female-specific splicing of\ntra pre-mRNA and results in a zygotic male-specifically\nspliced tra mRNA [6, 7, 25]. The tra gene is an upstream\nregulator of dsx and fru genes in C. capitata because the\nembryonic RNAi against tra and/or tra-2 experiments\nled to a stable splicing pattern change in tra, dsx, and\nfru pre-mRNAs only in XX individuals [7, 25]. In the\nother tephritid fruit flies, such as the Bactrocera species\nand Anastrepha species, the tra genes show similar mo-\nlecular organization and expression of hierarchy patterns\nto those found in C. capitata [8, 26 – 29]. These results\nsuggest that the tra orthologues may be the upstream\nregulators under the M factor control. The alternative\nsex-specific splicing of the tra gene is under the control\nof its own autoregulatory loop [6 – 8, 25 – 31]. This deci-\nsion is proposed to be initiated by the signal from the\nmaternal TRA protein, where the M factor is absent in\nXX females [6 – 8, 25]. In Drosophila, the functional TRA\nprotein co-operates with the constitutively expressed\nTransformer-2 (TRA-2) protein, and the complex acts\nas a splicing regulator [32, 33]. However, in C. capitata ,\nthe functional analysis of TRA/TRA-2 complex was in-\ndirectly inferred from the RNAi against Cctra-2 effecting\ntra splicing as well as dsx and fru splicing in XX individ-\nuals only [25]. Since the functional analysis of the TRA/\nTRA-2 complex has been experimentally proven only in\nD. melanogaster , it was postulated that in C. capitata the\nTRA/TRA-2 complex may bind to the putative TRA/\nTRA-2 binding sites located on the male-specific exons\nand their flanking introns in order to block the strong\nsplice site of male-specific exons. Thereafter, the other\nSR proteins and spliceosome machinery may be re-\ncruited, and the male-specific exons are skipped, result-\ning in female-specific splicing and the production of a\nfunctional TRA protein. On the other hand, in males\nwhere the M factor is present, this entire situation may\nbe turned off. Without TRA/TRA-2 regulation, the spli-\ncing may be followed by the default which contains in-\nframe stop codons on male-specific exons and leads to\nthe production of a non-functional truncated TRA pro-\ntein [6 – 8, 25 – 31]. The functional CcTRA proteins may\nbe the sex-specific splicing regulators [7]. They may not\nonly maintain their autoregulatory loop but may regulate\nthe alternative sex-specific splicing of a highly conserved\nbottom global effector in the sex determination pathway,\nthe so-called doublesex (dsx) gene [34]. The sex deter-\nmining message carried by this DSX protein can execute\nsexual differentiation processes in a very broad scheme.\nThe male- and female-specific DSX (DSX M and DSX F)\nproteins play transcription factor roles to regulate the\ndownstream genes involved in the sexual differentiation\n[32, 34]. Most of the mechanism underlining the regula-\ntory roles of the TRA/TRA-2 complex for dsx sex-\nspecifically spliced transcripts was only experimentally\nproven in D. melanogaster [32– 36] while much indirect\nevidence was gathered from the other tephritid species\n[37– 44]. The presence of functional TRA and TRA-2\nproteins acts as a splicing activator that binds to the dsx\nrepeat element ( dsx RE) on the female-specific exon.\nThis binding makes a nearby cis-purine rich element\nLaohakieat et al. BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 Page 2 of 17\n(dsx PRE) become a stronger splicing acceptor that facil-\nitates female-specific splicing resulting in the DSX F pro-\ntein. In contrast, the presence of truncated TRA cancels\nthe strength and potential of this splicing acceptor in\nmales due to no TRA/TRA-2 binding [32 – 36]. There-\nfore, the male-specifically spliced dsx transcript contains\nmale-specific exons. This leads to the production of the\nDSXM protein. The highly conserved dsx genes were\nalso cloned and characterized in many tephritid fruit fly\nmodels [37 – 42] including Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel)\n[43, 44] and Bactrocera correcta (Bezzi) [44]. The sex de-\ntermination pathway would be better understood if tra\n[ 7 ,8 ,2 6 – 29] and tra-2 [8, 25, 28 – 30] counterparts were\nalso characterized. Moreover, it would be advantageous\nto carry out comparative studies of tra and dsx relation-\nships within the tephritid group to refine the model of\nsex determination. The role of tra in the sex determin-\nation pathway and its related practical applications in\npest control programs can be further understood and re-\nalized when molecular comparisons are carried out in\nmodel organisms belonging to a highly diverse agricul-\nture pest genus such as Bactrocera. The oriental fruit fly\n(B. dorsalis ) and guava fruit fly ( B. correcta ) belong to\nthe Bactrocera genus, are economically important pests,\nand are therefore considered targets for control pro-\ngrams [45].\nIn this study, we isolated and characterized tra genes\nfrom B. dorsalis and B. correcta as well as their putative\ncore promoters. After the full-length cDNA of adult\nmales and females were obtained, RT-PCR was per-\nformed with appropriate primers to elucidate the alter-\nnative sex-specific splicing in male and female\ntranscripts. The structure and amino acid sequences of\nboth genes were highly conserved among the Bactrocera\nspecies, but less so in other tephritid fruit flies. Expres-\nsion analyses of tra genes (the upstream regulators) were\nalso studied in relation to the dsx genes (the bottom ef-\nfector) in the wild-type strain ( B. dorsalis ) and the Sal-\naya1 genetic sexing-mass-reared strain ( B. dorsalis ).\nMoreover, the tra RNAi experiment was carried out for\nthe functional analysis of masculinization using the\nbrown and white pupal sexual dimorphism of the Sal-\naya1 strain as a sexual karyotype identifier. The results\ndemonstrated the functions of the tra gene were highly\nconserved in the sex determination. In addition, the pu-\ntative core promoter regions of tra genes in B. dorsalis\nand B. correcta represented the initial discovery of such\nwithin the tephritid species. The newly isolated specula-\ntive core promoter regions of tra genes from Bactrocera\nzonata (Saunders), Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt), Bactro-\ncera carambolae Drew & Hancock (this work); the previ-\nously isolated Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin) [26]; and the\ndsx putative core promoters from B. dorsalis and B. cor-\nrecta [44] were also uncovered. Several molecular\nfeatures of tra orthologues were compared across Bac-\ntrocera species and their related genera to untangle the\nsex determination mechanism, suggesting further prac-\ntical genetic tools.\nResults and discussion\nMolecular organization of tra genes and alternative\nsplicing patterns\nThe molecular structure of the B. dorsalis tra (Bdtra)\ngene contained five common exons corresponding to\nexons 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, and 3, as in other Bactrocera spe-\ncies [8, 26, 28, 29]. The common exons 1A and 1B of\nBdtra were homologous to exon 1 of C. capitata tra\n(Cctra) [7] and Anastrepha obliqua (Macquart) tra\n(Aotra) [27] genes. Two similar female transcripts, Bdtra\nf1 [GenBank: KU254111] and Bdtra f2 [GenBank:\nKU254112] were approximately 1.9 kb long but different\nin the length of a 51 bp indel at the 3 ’UTR (not shown).\nThe open reading frame (ORF) of female transcripts was\n1266 bp encoding for a predicted polypeptide of 422\namino acids (Fig. 1a). Three male transcripts, Bdtra m1\n[GenBank: KU254113], Bdtra m2 [GenBank:\nKU254114], and Bdtra m3 [GenBank: KU254115] were\napproximately 2.3 kb long. These transcripts contained\ntwo conserved male-specific exons (ms3 and ms4)\ninserted between the common exons 1B and 2A as also\nappeared in the other Bactrocera species [8, 26, 28, 29].\nThe in-frame stop codons in ms3 and ms4 conceptually\nlead to the production of a truncated TRA protein with\n66 amino acids. Two novel male-specific exons (ms1\nand ms2) between the constitutive exons 1A and 1B\nwere found. These exons were either being alternatively\nspliced or coexisted in combination, resulting in three\npossible male-specific transcripts (Fig. 1a). The Bdtra\nm1, Bdtra m2 , and Bdtra m3 transcripts had a combin-\nation of ms1 and ms2 (87 bp), only ms1 (28 bp), and\nonly ms2 (59 bp), respectively (Fig. 1a). In several Bac-\ntrocera, the intron between common exons 1A and 1B is\nconstitutively spliced out [8, 28, 29]. Notably, the same\nintron is, however, observed to be specifically retained in\nB. oleae [26] and B. dorsalis (this work) males. Unlike\nthe case of B. oleae , there are three polymorphic iso-\nforms ( Bdtra m1 to m3). There are no recognizable\nTRA/TRA-2 binding sites, RBP1 (RNA-binding protein\n1) binding sites, and TRA-2 ISS (intronic splicing sup-\npressor) sequences around these newly discovered male-\nspecific exons. This suggests that the diversification of\nmale-specific exons is an active process in B. dorsalis .\nThis seems to be made possible without the involvement\nof splicing regulation such as TRA/TRA-2. The evolu-\ntion of TRA/TRA-2 may not be involved in the early\nsteps of sex-specific splicing in the sex determination\npathway. The selection of the male-specific splicing in\nthese regions might be relaxed because it entirely\nLaohakieat et al. BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 Page 3 of 17\ninvolves the 5 ’ UTR [46]. In addition to this work, an in-\ntron between two common male-specific exons (ms3\nand ms4) among other Bactrocera is totally retained with\nno obvious relationship to the TRA/TRA-2 binding site\nin B. dorsalis males (China population, [28, 29]). This\nfact also supports that the male-specific exon is evolving\nin B. dorsalis .\nIn B. correcta , the tra (Bctra) gene was approximately\n2 and 2.3 kb long in female- and male-transcripts, re-\nspectively [GenBank: KU254116 and KU254117]. There\nwas also conservation of the five common exons and the\ntwo male-specific exons (Fig. 1b). However, the novel\nmale-specific exons found in the Bdtra transcripts were\nnot evident. The ORF of the female-specific transcript\nwas 1239 bp and encoded for 413 amino acids. However,\nthe male TRA protein appeared truncated because there\nwere in-frame stop codons located in the male-specific\nexons.\nThe male-specific exons of tra genes in tephritid fruit\nflies located between the common exons 1 and 2 in C.\ncapitata [7] and Anastrepha species [27] or 1B and 2A\nin Bactrocera species [8, 26, 28, 29] contained at least\nthree in-frame stop codons leading to the production of\na non-functional TRA polypeptide. Moreover, these\nFig. 1 Molecular organization and sex-specific transcript of tra genes from B. dorsalis (a) and B. correcta (b). Both genes contain five common\nexons ( dark gray boxes ); however, there are four and two male-specific (ms) exons ( light gray boxes )i n Bdtra and Bctra, respectively. Introns are\nlines connecting exon boxes. The start codon (atg) is indicated in the common exon 1B while the conceptually alternative stop codons are either\nlocated in the downstream male-specific exons or in common exon 3 for the female transcript.\nLaohakieat et al. BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 Page 4 of 17\nmale-specific exons and their flanking introns had the\nputative splicing regulatory elements. These regions of\nBdtra and Bctra were analyzed and then compared to\nthe others: Bactrocera species [8, 26, 28, 29], Anastrepha\nspecies [27], C. capitata [7], and D. melanogaster [32]\n(Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Table\nS1). Four putative regulatory elements (i.e., TRA/TRA-2,\nRBP1 binding sites, TRA-2 ISS sequences, and purine-\nrich elements) were observed [47, 48]. The two male-\nspecific exons found between the two common exons 1B\nand 2A are also conserved in all Bactrocera species, as\nin the other tephritids. In this case, many of those puta-\ntive regulatory elements were found to be clustered [7,\n26, 27]. Future functional studies of these TRA/TRA-2\nbinding sites are required because there is only informa-\ntion regarding dsx and fruitless (fru) sex-specifically\nspliced genes from D. melanogaster [33, 36, 49] at\npresent.\nSex-specific splicing analysis\nThree sets of RT-PCR were carried out in males and fe-\nmales of B. dorsalis and B. correcta . These results dem-\nonstrated that Bdtra and Bctra pre-mRNA were\nalternatively sex-specific spliced. The first set of primers,\n2B-F – 2B-R2, was located on common exon 2B (Fig. 2a),\nand the amplified RT-PCR product was identical in\ncDNA derived from both sexes and genomic DNA for\n458 bp of B. dorsalis and 455 bp of B. correcta (Fig. 2b\nand c). The second set of primers, 1B-F – 2B-R1, was lo-\ncated on common exons 1B and 2B, respectively, flank-\ning the male-specific exons (Fig. 2a). The amplified\nproducts were different in males and females. The male\namplified products of 980 bp for Bdtra and 951 bp for\nBctra were greater than the female amplified products of\n626 and 599 bp for Bdtra and Bctra, respectively (Fig. 2b\nand c). The third set of primers, ms-F – ms-R, was lo-\ncated on male-specific exons (Fig. 2a). A specific band of\n184 bp for Bdtra and 183 bp for Bctra was detected only\nin males, as expected (Fig. 2b and c), supporting that\nmale transcripts contain in addition male-specific exons.\nTherefore, males encoded non-functional truncated\nTRA peptides and only the female transcript produced\nfunctional TRA polypeptides. These have been com-\nmonly found in other tephritid fruit flies [6 – 8, 26 – 29].\n5’ upstream regulatory sequences and putative core\npromoters\nAppropriate inverse PCR primers were designed after\nthe complete CDS of Bdtra and Bctra genes were ob-\ntained in order to amplify their 5 ’ upstream regulatory\nregions and putative core promoters. The length of the\n5’UTRs ( Bdtra, 341, 372, and 400 bp in males and\n313 bp in females; Bctra, 311 bp in both sexes) was still\nan estimation based on the most upstream RT-PCR\nforward primer binding position carried out using the\nother reverse primer located within a coding region and\ntotal cDNA template experiments. A continual upstream\nseries of RT-PCR primers was originally designed and\ntested from inverse PCR and genomic DNA templates,\nrespectively. Normally, the 5 ’RACE is a conventional\nmethod to identify the 5 ’UTR length. In the previous\nwork in the B. dorsalis China population (171 bp [28]\nand 117 bp [29]), the 5 ’UTR derived from such method\nwas a few hundred bp shorter. The sequence upstream\nof the translation start site, including the 5 ’UTR of Bdtra\nand Bctra, encompassed 1439 bp [GenBank: KU254107]\nand 1496 bp [GenBank: KU254106], respectively. The 5 ’\nupstream regulatory regions and putative core pro-\nmoters of Bdtra and Bctra were AT rich regions (66.23\nand 66.51 %, respectively). The upstream regions of both\ngenes revealed to a certain degree the characteristics of\nputative core promoters for transcription by RNA poly-\nmerase II that consisted of a CAAT box, TATA box, Ini-\ntiator (Inr), motif ten element (MTE), and downstream\ncore promoter element (DPE) found in D. melanogaster\n[50, 51] (Fig. 3). The identification of these speculative\ncis-regulatory sequences was carried out by visual in-\nspection for the most conserved putative TATA box and\nInr sequences as per the Drosophila core promoter data-\nbase [50 – 52] within the upstream regulatory regions.\nThe characteristics of the putative core promoter were\nobserved in the Bdtra and Bctra that covered positions\n−29 to +32 and −31 through +37 in relation to an A\n(+1) in the Inr sequence, respectively (Fig. 3). The func-\ntional analysis of the 5 ’ upstream regulatory region and\nputative core promoter of Bctra gene was performed\nusing the DsRed as a reporter gene with SV40 poly A\nsignal (#1215- Bctra-DsRed constructs). The Bctra-puta-\ntive promoter sequence driving DsRed construct was\ncreated and microinjected into the early embryos of the\nB. correcta wild-type strain. The microinjected embryos\n(G0) representing developmental times (from 1 to\n48 hours after egg laying (h AEL)) were screened for\ntransient DsRed fluorescence and compared with the\nuninjected embryos. A consistently low level of DsRed\nfluorescence was detected after the 19 – 20 h AEL, with\nno fluorescence signal observed in the uninjected em-\nbryos. The brightest DsRed fluorescence was observed in\nembryos at 31 h AEL (Fig. 4). When this Bctra-putative\npromoter sequence driving DsRed construct was cross-\nspecies microinjected into the early embryos of B. dor-\nsalis wild-type strain, no positive result was observed.\nThis supports that the tra promoter may be species-\nspecific although further, more intensive functional\ncharacterization will be needed to confirm this propen-\nsity. The evidence suggests the discovery of a tra puta-\ntive core promoter in B. correcta .M o r e o v e r ,t h e\nupstream regions of putative core promoters covering\nLaohakieat et al.

This re-\ngion may be a core promoter region because it contains\nmany conserved putative core promoter elements. For\nexample, the putative TATA box and putative Inr se-\nquence were 75 and 83.3 % identical, respectively, to\ntheir consensus sequences from the Drosophila core\npromoter database (Fig. 3) [50 – 52]. In addition, the loca-\ntion of the upstream “T” in the putative TATA box was\nexactly at the −31 position in relation to the “A” in the\nputative Inr consensus sequence, concurring with the\nTATA box location preference with regard to the Inr\nmotif [50]. The other less conserved putative core\nFig. 2 Detection of sex-specific Bdtra and Bctra transcripts by RT-PCR analysis from wild-type strains. a The location of appropriate primers is indicated\nby arrows.

The putative core promoter\nmotifs were observed in B. tryoni , B. carambolae , B.\nzonata,a n d B. oleae [26] in similar vicinities. Moreover,\nsimilar putative core promoters were also present in the\npreviously characterized dsx genes of B. dorsalis and B.\ncorrecta [44] (Fig. 3).

BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 Page 9 of 17\nSR proteins that contains a characteristic serine-arginine\ndipeptide-rich region (the so-called RS domain) and a\nproline-rich region at the C-terminal end [11, 53]. The\nfour known TRA specific-domains were observed (Fig. 5)\n[11, 54, 55]. The term “domain” used for the TRA protein\nstudies only refers to a short region of conserved amino\nacid comparison [11, 54, 55]. There were no biochemical\nand/or functional studies of any TRA proteins. A stretch\nof 21 identical amino acids was confirmed as the TRA-\nCAM (C, Ceratitis;A , Apis;M , Musca)d o m a i n .T h e\nTRA-CAM domain is truncated in the male non-\nfunctional TRA protein and has been hypothesized to be\ninvolved in the autoregulation of the tra gene [11, 54, 55].\nDomain 1 was adjacent to the TRA-CAM domain and\nclose to the N-terminal end. It had a lesser degree of\nconservation (61 – 76 %) among tephritids. Domains 1\nand 2 were absent in non-autoregulation DmTRA\nwhere the TRA protein did not act as an upstream\nregulator. Therefore, the TRA-CAM may play roles in\nreceiving the primary signal from the M factor and/or\nfacilitating the autoregulation as a splicing suppressor\nof tra pre-mRNA. The expected domain 3 (DIP do-\nmain) was also found to be conserved among Diptera\nfruit flies [11, 54, 55]. In addition, a long stretch of a\nserine-arginine rich region (approximately 150 amino\nacids) was characterized between domains 3 and 4.\nTwenty out of 71 (72 %) serine-arginine positions\nwere found to be identical in the Bactrocera species\nunder investigation. Only domain 4 was found to be\nidentical in the family tephritidae. A characteristic\nproline-rich region (approximately 75 amino acids) at\nthe C-terminal end was located right after domain 4.\nAll of the conserved features were almost identical\namong the Bactrocera species.\nA newly highly conserved region was discovered\namong tephritids with 61 – 83 % similarity (Fig. 5 and\nAdditional file 5: Figure S4). This new region was named\n“TEP” because it appeared distinctive among tephritids.\nThe TEP region was located approximately 33 amino\nacids downstream of domain 2 and was encoded by\nexons 2A and 2B. The TEP region may represent a spe-\ncific characteristic of the TRA protein in the sex deter-\nmination pathway of the tephritidae family.\nThe conservation level of various protein regions (i.e.,\ndomains 1 to 4, and the TEP region) within the TRA\nprotein was as restricted as the functional protein do-\nmains found in DSX (OD1 and OD2) [44, 56] in Bactro-\ncera. The term “domain” for the DSX protein has a\ndifferent meaning because the OD domains are well de-\nfined protein domains supported by experimental data\n[57]. This fact implies that protein interactions in the\nsex determination pathway may be of high fidelity in\nfunction. This is especially noted for domain 2 (TRA-\nCAM) and domain 4 of the TRA protein, which were\nidentical in all tephritids in this study. Although the\nidentification of short regions showing high similarity in\nall tephritidae TRA proteins is interesting, these putative\ndomains have no similarity to other proteins in meta-\nzoans. This fact diminishes the possibility to propose po-\ntential functions. In addition, the lack of any structural\nstudies on the TRA proteins and their four putative do-\nmains is a major obstacle towards understanding these\nputative functional domains.\nFunctional analyses of masculinization in the Salaya1\ngenetic sexing strain\nThe microinjected dsRNA containing a 1.1 kb fragment\nfrom the 3 ’ end of Bdtra cDNA can masculinize B. dor-\nsalis (Additional file 6: Figure S5). In this case, the XY\nmale- and XX female-sexual karyotypes are brown- and\nwhite-pupae, respectively, because the B. dorsalis Salaya\n1 genetic sexing strain was used. The Salaya1 brown-\npupae male contains a Y-autosome translocated chromo-\nsome which was derived from the wild-type (Phayathai1\nstrain) during the development of the genetic sexing\nstrain [58]. The Y-autosome translocation chromosome\nwas induced using a low degree of gamma radiation and\nunderwent genetic screening that assumed the chromo-\nsomal rearrangement process. The white-pupae pseudo-\nmale can be fertile and produce daughter only\nprogenies. However, the abnormal testes (Additional file\n7: Figure S6) were also evident, as per Liu et al. 2015\n[28].\nThe expression of tra and dsx genes was analyzed in\nthe male/female wild-type, the brown-pupae male/white-\npupae female of the Salaya1, and tra RNAi- treated\nbrown-pupae males and white-pupae pseudomales\n(Fig. 6). Bdtra primers 1B-F – 2B-R1 (this work), and\nBddsx primers C4 – Male-specific ( m) primers and C3 –\nFemale-specific ( f) primers [44] were used to perform\nthe RT-PCR for individual samples. This analysis was\ndone in order to investigate the function of the tra gene\nthat regulates the sex-specific splicing of tra and dsx\ngenes. For the Bdtra gene, a single band of male-specific\nproduct (980 bp) was observed in the wild-type males.\nLikewise, a female-specific product (626 bp) was seen in\nthe females (Fig. 6a). All of the observed male- and\nfemale-specific products in this experiment and the fol-\nlowing experiments were cloned for sequence confirm-\nation. On the contrary, the coexistence of those male-\nand female-specific products was detected in the Salaya1\nbrown-pupae males. In addition, a faint intermediate\nband between the male- and female-specific products\nwas consistently observed. However, this band seemed\nto be an artefact because only male- and female-specific\nproducts were revealed when the molecular cloning had\nbeen undertaken. Only the female-specific product was\nobserved in the white-pupae females. In the RNAi\nLaohakieat et al. BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 Page 10 of 17\nexperiment, only the male-specific product was present\nin the brown-pupae males after the RNAi treatment\nwhereas the same male-specific product was detected to-\ngether with a weaker signal of the female-specific prod-\nuct in the white-pupae pseudomales (Fig. 6a).\nFor the Bddsx gene, a single band of male-specific\nproduct (484 bp) was observed in the wild-type males\nand the Salaya1 brown-pupae males. Likewise, a female-\nspecific product (677 bp) was in the females. In the\nRNAi experiment, only the male-specific product was\nalso present in the brown-pupae males. However, both\nmale- and female-specific products were detected in the\nwhite-pupae pseudomales (Fig. 6b).\nFor the functional analysis, RNAi experimentation con-\nfirmed that tra and dsx regulated sexual differentiation [7,\n25, 26, 28, 59]. The presence of both male and female tra\ntranscripts in the adult stage suggests that the sex deter-\nmination and development may not be completed, consid-\nering the appearance of abnormal testis development and\nno mating behavior in most of the pseudomales.\nThe hypothetical Y-linked male determining factor ( M\nfactor) is proposed as that which initiates the blocking of\nFig. 6 RT-PCR of sex-specific Bdtra and Bddsx transcripts in the wild strain, GSS, and tra RNAi-treated GSS. a Primers 1B-F and 2B-R1, flanking\nmale-specific exons ms3 and ms4, were used to detect the presence of male- and female-specific tra transcripts (960 and 626 bp, respectively).\nLanes 1, 4, and 7 are derived from male cDNA templates of wild-type, GSS (brown pupae (BP)), and RNAi-treated GSS (BP), respectively. Likewise,\nlanes 2 and 5 are derived from female cDNA templates of wild-type and GSS (white pupae (WP)), respectively. Lane 8 is derived from a\npseudomale (WP). Lanes 3, 6, and 9 are negative controls without RT ( −ve). b Primers c4 (common exon) and m (male-specific exon) were used\nto detect the male-specific dsx transcript (484 bp). Likewise, primers c3 (common exon) and f (female-specific exon) were used to detect the\nfemale-specific dsx transcript (677 bp) [44]. These two pairs of primers were used separately with the same cDNA templates as used in ( a).\nHowever, the banding pattern in each lane came from the pool RT-PCR products that can detect the male- and female- specific dsx transcripts.\nLaohakieat et al. BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 Page 11 of 17\ntra autoregulatory loops and prohibits female-specific\nsplicing of the zygotic tra pre-mRNA in precellular\nblastoderm male embryos of C. capitata and Bactrocera\njarvisi (Tryon) [6, 8]. During this period, the translation\nof the inactive TRA protein increases and abolishes the\ntra autoregulatory loop in males because there is no\nfunctional splicing regulation from TRA/TRA-2 com-\nplex binding. The abundance of zygotic male-specific,\nfemale-specific, and heterogeneous tra mRNA is appar-\nent in both male and female embryos during this pri-\nmary signalling [6, 28]. Afterward, the male-specific and\nfemale-specific tra transcripts are generally and exclu-\nsively established in males and females, respectively, pre-\nsumably because of the stable genetic switch tra.\nThe coexistence of male- and female-specific tra tran-\nscripts during the same period could not be confirmed\nin the expression analysis of precellularized B. dorsalis\nembryos because the embryos were not sex sorted [28].\nHowever, the presence of the male-specific transcript\nsimilarly appears before cellularization. This suggests\nthat the roles of the non-characterized, but postulated,\nM factor may be highly conserved in Bactrocera and\ntephritid fruit flies [6 – 8, 25 – 28]. The introgression of\nthe presumably M factor-bearing Y-chromosome from\nB. jarvisi and B. dorsalis into B. tryoni and B. carambo-\nlae, respectively, could interchangeably regulate normal\nsex determination [8, 60]. However, in this work, the\nmixed male- and female-specific tra transcripts were ob-\nserved in all of the brown-pupae adult (XY) males but\nnot in the white-pupae (XX) females of the Salaya1\nstrain at the adult stage. We hypothesized that the M\nfactor on the Y-chromosome had acquired a leaky mu-\ntant stage from the Y-chromosome rearrangement ori-\nginating from the GSS construction; the M factor cannot\ncompletely block the autoregulatory loop in all male\nkaryotype individuals. The leaky M factor function can\nbe rescued by tra RNAi-treatment in the brown-pupae\nadult males. This results in the disappearance of female-\nspecific tra transcripts. The situation can also be partly\nimitated in the application of tra RNAi to the white\npupae (XX pseudomales). However, a clear difference is\nthat the same coexistence of both male- and female-\nspecifically spliced tra transcripts did not result in the\nsame co-expression of both male- and female-\nspecifically spliced dsx transcripts as in the case of the\nSalaya1 male (with the M factor) versus the pseudomale\n(without the M factor). In the pseudomale, the incom-\nplete expression of a functional TRA protein can form a\nTRA/TRA-2 complex which is effective enough to con-\ntrol the female-specifically spliced dsx. However, in the\nSalaya1 male that has a leaky M factor, the similarly in-\ncomplete expression of a functional TRA protein may\nalso form a TRA/TRA-2 complex, but it seems that the\nTRA/TRA-2 complex is not effective enough to activate\na female-specifically spliced dsx. This fact suggests a\npossible direct association between the presences of the\nM factor and TRA-2 gene in the adult stage. In order to\nprovide a justification, we postulate that the M factor\nmay extend its function into adult males by inactivation\nof not only TRA, but also TRA-2 proteins. A more re-\ncent male sex determination model proposed by Salve-\nmini et al. 2009 [25] suggests the possibility of an M\nfactor repressed TRA-2 protein/gene at the embryonic\nstage. We propose that this mechanism can function\nduring the adult stage. It is proposed that the M factor\ndirectly inhibits TRA protein activation in C. capitata\n[6, 7] and Bactrocera species [8]. If the leaky mutant M\nfactor in the Salaya1 brown-pupae males affects the\nTRA and TRA-2 protein activities in adult males, the\nlevel of TRA/TRA-2 complexes may not reach the\nthreshold to enhance female-specific exonic splicing of\ndsx pre-mRNA.\nPotential application of tra genes for the development of\na genetic sexing system in SIT programs\nThe comparative study of tra in many Bactrocera species\nsuggests a practical application of the tra based-genetic\ntools. The cross-species utilization of a very highly con-\nserved male-specific exon/intron cassette in the gener-\nation of a sex-specific lethality strain is likely among the\nBactrocera genera. The TRA/TRA-2 binding sites lo-\ncated in the last male-specific exon of tra genes are\nidentical in B. dorsalis (this work), B. correcta (this\nwork), B. zonata [61], B. tryoni [8], B. jarvisi [8], and B.\noleae [26]. Therefore, a single construct for female-\nspecific RIDL (Release of Insects carrying a Dominant\nLethal) or fsRIDL may work very well for various Bac-\ntrocera pests because it relies on the male-specific exon\nsplicing of the tra gene [62, 63]. The tra RNAi-\ntreatment can be generally used for sexual transform-\nation. However, the derived pseudomales may not be\nfully masculinized with normal reproductive potential as\nin this work and elsewhere [7, 25, 26, 28, 59]. Further\nstudies of the sex determination pathway, especially the\nfinding and characterization of the male-determining\nloci on Y-chromosome and its primary signal pathways\nwould lead to an ideal tool to develop a new\nmasculinization strategy for the genetic sexing strain.\nThe putative core promoters and their upstream regions\nshould contain all necessary promoter/enhancer cis-\nregulatory elements because these regions are all flanked\nby the highly conserved LOC 105232903 orthologues.\nThe potential application of the promoter is for it to be\nused in an early embryonic driver constructions, such as\na tetracycline (Tet)-suppressible system [62, 64 – 66],\nbecause the zygotic tra expression is a very early event,\nbefore the cellularization stage.\nLaohakieat et al. BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 Page 12 of 17\nConclusions\nThe comparison of Bdtra and Bctra genes to the other\nBactrocera and tephritid flies confirms the conserved\nfunctional roles of tra in the sex determination pathway.\nIn addition, a new TEP region is proposed because of\nthe conservation among tephritid fruit flies. The gener-\nation of new male-specific splicing exons in the Bdtra\nsupports that the initial stage of the alternative splicing\nprocess involves multiple exon retention. The evolution\nof sex-specific splicing is radiating within species from\nthe B. dorsalis model. All of the 5 ’ regulatory regions of\nthe Bactrocera tra genes contain characteristics of the\nputative core promoter. The comparative molecular fea-\ntures of Bdtra and Bctra also offer potential applications\ndirectly for the B. dorsalis , B. correta , or universally for\nother Bactrocera genetic sexing systems for SIT.\nMethods\nFruit fly strains and specimens\nThe laboratory stocks, B. dorsalis (Phayathai1 strain)\nand B. correcta (Phayathai2 strain), were used to isolate\nand characterize Bdtra and Bctra genes, respectively.\nThe B. dorsalis Salaya1 GSS is based on the brown-\nwhite pupal color dimorphisms (i.e., males and females\nthat emerged from brown and white pupae, respectively\n[58]). They were used for expression and functional ana-\nlyses of the Bdtra gene. The fruit flies were reared at\n25 °C and 13 L: 11D cycles. B. zonata and B. tryoni spec-\nimens were from laboratory stocks of the Insect Pest\nControl Laboratory of the International Atomic Energy\nAgency, Seiberdorf, Austria. In addition, samples of B.\ncarambolae were from the Jakarta strain.\nGenBank Accession Numbers\nThe GenBank Accession Numbers of tra and dsx genes\nused in this study were from various tephritid species\nand D. melanogaster. The tra and dsx orthologues were\nseparately grouped and consolidated in Additional file 8:\nTable S2 and Additional file 9: Table S3, respectively.\nDNA and RNA extractions\nGenomic DNA was individually extracted from adult\nfruit flies according to Baruffi et al. 1995 [67]. Total\nRNA was isolated from adult male and female fruit flies\n(2– 4 days old) using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen, USA)\nas per the manufacturer ’s instructions.\nIsolation of Bdtra and Bctra\nThe primers BoF and BoR designed from Botra [Gen-\nBank: AJ715413], were used to firstly isolate the tra\northologues of B. dorsalis and B. correcta , using genomic\nDNA as templates. All primers used in this work are de-\nscribed in Additional file 10: Table S4. The partial se-\nquences from both species were aligned to derive\nprimers for 3 ’RACE and nested PCR. Three to five mi-\ncrograms of total RNA were reverse transcribed to first\nstrand cDNA using the oligo (dT) adapter primer and\nImProm-II™ Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, USA), fol-\nlowing the manufacturer ’s instructions. One-tenth of the\ninitial reverse transcription reaction was used as a tem-\nplate in 3 ’ RACE using 2B-F and adapter primers. Amp-\nlification was performed using a FlexCycler PCR thermal\ncycler (Analytik Jena, Germany) with the following con-\nditions: 94 °C for 4 min, held at 72 °C for 5 min while\nTaq polymerase (Vivantis, Malaysia) was added, then\none cycle of 60 °C for 2 min and 72 °C for 2 min,\nfollowed by five cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for\n2 min, 72 °C for 2 min; 28 cycles of 91 °C for 40 s, 58 °C\nfor 2 min, 72 °C for 2 min; and one cycle of final exten-\nsion at 72 °C for 7 min. The negative controls for each\nset of RT-PCR experiments were performed excluding\nreverse transcriptase in order to ensure no genomic\nDNA contamination.\nFor the characterization of the 5 ’ UTR regions and the\ntranslational start site of Bdtra, two sets of RT-PCR\n[(1B-F – 2B-R1) and (5U-BD1 – 2A-2R)] were per-\nformed to generate two contiguous fragments to assem-\nble the 5 ’UTR region and translational start site. Cycling\nconditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 29 cycles of\n94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min; and one\ncycle of final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR was also\nperformed on genomic DNA templates to determine the\nexon/intron junctions. Three sets of primers (i.e., 5U-\nBD1 – 2A-2R, 1B-TraF – 2B-R2, and Nested TraF –\n3Tra-R) were used to amplify the contiguous fragments\nwith the following cycling conditions: 94 °C for 5 min;\n29 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for\n1 min; and one cycle of final extension at 72 °C for\n7 min. For the same Bctra characterization, the previ-\nously described procedures were carried out, except that\nthe primer 5U-BD1 was replaced by 5U-BC1.\nInverse PCR\nBdtra and Bctra sequences (this work) were inspected to\nidentify the proper restriction enzymes. Subsequently,\nprimers were designed based on the 5 ’UTR regions. The\ninverse PCR method was as per Permpoon et al. 2011\n[44] except EcoRI restriction digest. Inverse PCR was\ncarried out with 5U-BD1_R – 5U-BD3 primers (for B.\ndorsalis) and 5U-BC1_R – 5U-BC4 primers (for B. cor-\nrecta) using the following cycling conditions: 94 °C for\n7 min; 29 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C\nfor 5 min; and one cycle of final extension at 72 °C for\n10 min.\nFunctional promoter analysis\nA 1.4 kb fragment of the 5 ’ upstream regulatory region\nincluding the putative core promoter and translational\nLaohakieat et al. BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 Page 13 of 17\nstart codon of Bctra gene was amplified with the\nBcT-3_NcoI – BcT-4_XbaI primers using genomic\nDNA as a template. Cycling conditions were as fol-\nlows: 94 °C for 5 min; 29 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min,\n5 8° Cf o r3 0s ,7 2° Cf o r2m i n ;a n do n ec y c l eo f\nfinal extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplicon was\nsubsequently cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy Vector\n(Promega, USA). The NcoI-XbaIc u t Bctra fragments\nwere ligated in the NcoI-XbaI cut #1215 vector (pSL af\ntTA-SV40_af ) [65] to create the #1215- Bctra vector\n(pSLaf_Bctra–tTA_af ). A DsRed restriction fragment\nwas generated from dsRed_ XbaIF – dsRed_BamHIR\nprimers using the #1200 vector (p Bac[fa PUb-DsRed ])\nas a template [68]. The Bctra-DsRed construct was\ncreated by molecular cloning replacement of the\nXbaI-BamHIt T Af r a g m e n tw i t ht h e XbaI-BamHI\nDsRed fragment into the #1215- Bctra vector and\ncalled #1215- Bctra-DsRed vector (pSL af_Bctra–\nDsRed_af ).\nThe transient expression was performed by micro-\ninjection of the #1215- Bctra-DsRed constructs (750 ng/\nµl) into the dechorionated precellular blastoderm em-\nbryos from the B. correcta wild-type strain. The microin-\njected embryos representing developmental times (from\n1 to 48 hours after egg laying (h AEL)) were screened\nevery hour by epifluorescence for the expression of the\n#1215-Bctra-DsRed construct and compared with the\nuninjected embryos. The screening was performed using\nthe fluorescence stereomicroscope Olympus SZX16\nReflected Fluorescence System with the filters SZX2-\nFRFP (BP545-580; BA610IF). Photographic documenta-\ntion was done using an Olympus DP2-BSW version 2.2.\nIsolation of additional 5 ’ upstream putative regulatory\nregion of tra genes from B. zonata , B. tryoni , and B.\ncarambolae\nThe forward primer Tpro was designed based on puta-\ntive coding sequences of the LOC105232903 locus [Gen-\nBank: XM_011214797.1] from B. dorsalis because the\nsequence was found to be immediately upstream of the\n5’ regulatory region of the Bdtra and Bctra in this work.\nThe reverse primer 1B-1R was designed on the basis of\nthe conserved tra coding sequences approximately\n150 bp from the start codon. The genomic DNA of B.\nzonata, B. tryoni , and B. carambolae were used as tem-\nplates. The PCR conditions were as per the following:\n94 °C for 5 min; 29 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for\n30 s, 72 °C for 2 min; and one cycle of final extension at\n72 °C for 7 min. The 5 ’ and 3 ’ sequences of the derived\nspecific PCR products were validated for being the cor-\nresponding CDS of the LOC105232903 locus and tra\northologues by multiple sequence alignment with the\nhomologous regions in B. dorsalis and B. correcta .\nCloning PCR fragments\nThe specific amplicon was purified with the QIA-\nquick gel cleanup kit (QIAGEN, Germany). The\nproducts were cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector\n(Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer ’si n -\nstructions. The recombinant plasmids were trans-\nformed into DH5 α competent cells and screened.\nPlasmids were extracted as described by Sambrook\net al. 1989 [69]. All sequencing reactions were per-\nformed on both strands using the sequencing service\nfrom Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea.\nRT-PCR expression analysis\nThe first stand cDNA of both sexes from each spe-\ncies was separately synthesized. The reverse tran-\nscription method and the negative controls were\nsimilar to the Bdtra and Bctra isolation procedure.\nThe RT-PCR expression analysis was performed\nusing common and sex-specific primers, represented\nin Fig. 2a. Cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C\nfor 2 min; 29 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for\n30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; and one cycle of final exten-\nsion at 72 °C for 7 min. All of the RT-PCR experi-\nments were repeated three times. The primers used\nin this study are described in Additional file 10:\nTable S4.\nRNAi experiment\nThe 2B-F and adapter primers located on exon 2B and\nthe 3 ’ end poly (A) tail, respectively, were used to amp-\nlify an approximately 1.1 kb fragment of the Bdtra.T h e\namplicon (forward gene fragment) and the inverted se-\nquence (reverse gene fragment) were cloned into\npGEM®-T easy vector (Promega, USA) and transformed\ninto E. coli (DH5α). Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) of\nBdtra was synthesized by in vitro bacterial expression\nusing the T7-polymerase system. To produce double-\nstranded RNA (dsRNA), forward and reverse RNA frag-\nments were mixed in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris\npH 8 and 10 mM NaCl). Incubation was done at 75 °C\nfor 5 min (annealing), then cooled down to room\ntemperature (25 °C).\nThe Salaya1 embryos were harvested and kept for\n40 min at 18 °C. Approximately 1000 precellular blasto-\nderm embryos were dechorionated and micro-injected\nwith 1 μg/μlo f Bdtra dsRNA at the posterior end. The\nsurviving RNAi-treated embryos were raised to the\npupal stage in normal conditions. The brown and white\npupae were individually isolated, awaiting sexual identifi-\ncation after adult emergence. The white-pupae males\nwere categorized as pseudomales because the untreated\nRNAi white pupae were females with the XX sexual\nkaryotype [58].\nLaohakieat et al. BMC Genetics  (2016) 17:34 Page 14 of 17\nMating behavior and fertility of the sexually ma-\nture pseudomales were tested against RNAi-treated\nand RNAi-untreated brown-pupae males from the\nSalaya1 strain. The investigation was carried out by\npairing individual tested males or pseudomales with\nt h r e en o r m a ls e x u a l l ym a t u r ea n dv i r g i nw h i t e - p u p a e\nfemales. Five RNAi-untreated brown-pupae males,\nfive RNAi-treated brown-pupae males, and six RNAi-\ntreated white-pupae pseudomales were individually\ntested for mating behavior and fertility when they\nwere sexually mature. Subsequently, their testis de-\nvelopment was inspected by microscopic dissection.\nRT-PCR analysis of RNAi-treated flies\nThe previously described RT-PCR conditions were per-\nformed to analyze the sex-spec ific expression patterns of\nBdtra and Bddsx from B. dorsalis (Phayathai1 and Salaya1\nstrains) and their RNAi-treat ed brown-pupae males versus\nwhite-pupae pseudomales. Three sets of primers were used\nin this experiment: 1B-F – 2B-R1 primers for Bdtra ana-\nlysis, C3 – Female-specific (f) primers for female-specific\nBddsx analysis, and C4 – Male-specific ( m) primers for\nmale-specificBddsx analysis [44]. All of the RT-PCR experi-\nments were repeated three times. The primer sequences\nare presented in Additional file 10: Table S4.\nSequence alignment and phylogenetic tree reconstruction\nSequences were searched using the BLAST family of\nprograms from the NCBI database for gene identifica-\ntion. Genomic DNA and cDNA sequences were aligned\nusing the ClustalX2 program [70] and Unipro UGENE\nVersion 1.14.0 [71]. The genetic distance was estimated\nusing Jukes-Cantor measurement. The phylogenetic tree\nof tra genes were reconstructed using the UPGMA\nmethod in the CLC Main Workbench version 7.6.2\n(CLC Bio, QIAGEN). The bootstrap values were formu-\nlated from 1000 replicates with the 50 % majority rule.\nEthics statement\nThis manuscript describes functional genetics of non-\nregulated invertebrate (domestic insect pests) thus did\nnot require animal ethics approval.\nAvailability of data\nAll supporting data are included as additional files.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1.
