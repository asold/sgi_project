Introduction\nRecent years have seen convergence of work in digital libraries, museums and archives with a view to resource\ndiscovery and opening up access to digital collections. Various projects are following standards-based approaches\nbuilding upon terminology and knowledge organisation systems (Hodge 2000). Concurrently, within the web\ncommunity, there has been growing interest in vocabulary-based techniques, with the realisation of the challenges\nposed by web searching and retrieval applications. This has manifested itself in metadata initiatives, such as Dublin\nCore and the proposed W3C Resource Description Framework. In order to support retrieval, provision is made in\nsuch metadata element sets for thematic keywords from vocabulary tools such as thesauri (ISO 2788, ISO 5964).\nOntologies incorporating thesauri or related semantic models underpin diverse ongoing projects in remote access,\nquality-based services, cross domain searching, semantic interoperability, building RDF models and digital libraries\ngenerally (Amann and Fundulaki 1999; Doerr and Fundulaki 1998; Koch 2000; Michard and Pham-Dac 1998).\nThis paper is in two parts. We first discuss a case study that explored the retrieval potential of an augmented set of\nthesaurus relationships by specialising standard relationships into richer subtypes, in particular hierarchical\ngeographical containment and the associative relationship. We then locate this work in a broader context by\nreviewing various attempts to build taxonomies of thesaurus relationships and conclude by discussing the feasibility\nof hierarchically augmenting the core set of thesaurus relationships, particularly the associative relationship. The\nwork described here was part of a larger project, OASIS (Ontologically Augmented Spatial Information System),\nexploring terminology systems for thematic and spatial access in digital library applications. One of its aims\nconcerned the retrieval potential of spatial metadata with rich place name data but limited locational data\n(footprint). Such representations occur in online gazetteers, geographical thesauri or geographic name servers,\nwhen conventional GIS datasets are unavailable, unnecessary or pose undesirable bandwidth limitations (Hill 2000;\nJones 1997).\nAnother aim was to explore the potential of reasoning over the semantic relationships in thesauri to assist retrieval.\nThe three main thesaurus relationships are Equivalence (equivalent terms), Hierarchical (broader/narrower terms:\nBT/NTs), Associative (Related Terms: RTs). Studies support the use of thesauri in online retrieval and the potential\nfor combining free text and controlled vocabulary approaches (e.g. Fidel 1991). However there are various research\nchallenges, including the ‘vocabulary problem’ – differences in choice of index term at different times by indexers\nand searchers (Chen et al. 1997). Indexer and searcher may be operating at different levels of specificity, and at\n2\ndifferent times an indexer(s) may make different choices from a set of possible term options. While conventional\nnarrower term expansion may help in some situations, a more systematic approach to thesaurus term expansion has\nthe potential to improve recall in such situations. In the work described here, we have employed the Getty AAT and\nTGN vocabularies1. Harpring (1999) gives an overview of the Getty’s vocabularies with examples of their use in\nweb retrieval interfaces and collection management systems. Examples are given of their use as a source of variant\nnames of a concept. It is suggested that the AAT’s RT relationships may be helpful to a user exploring topics\naround an information need and the issue of how to perform query expansion without generating too large a result\nset is also raised.\nIn section 2 we discuss our schema, illustrating how the spatial relationships in the thesaurus can be used to provide\nmore flexible retrieval for queries incorporating place names. The second topic (sections 3 and 4) concerns the use\nof associative thesaurus relationships in retrieval. Existing collection management systems include access to\nthesauri for cataloguing with fairly rudimentary use of thesauri in retrieval (mostly limited to interactive query\nexpansion/refinement and Narrower Term expansion). In particular, there is scope for increased use of associative\n(RT) relationships in thesaurus-based retrieval tools. There is a danger that incorporating RTs into retrieval tools\nwith automatic query expansion may lead to uncontrolled expansion of result sets. We discuss experimental\nscenarios involving semantic distance measures in order to map key issues affecting use of RTs. Section 5 reviews\nvarious taxonomies of augmented thesaurus relationships while Section 6 discusses the potential for a limited\nextension of the core set of relationships. Conclusions are outlined in section 7.\n2. OASIS Overview and Spatial Access Example\nWe adopted collection data from the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland\n(RCAHMS) database of Scottish archaeological sites and historical buildings (Murray, 1997). The AAT provided\nthematic index terms such as ‘arrow’, ‘bronze’, ‘axe’, ‘castle’, etc. The spatial data in the OASIS system includes\ninformation on hierarchical and adjacency relations between named places, in addition to place types, and (centroid)\nco-ordinates. This information was taken from the TGN (Harpring 1997), augmented with data derived from the\nBartholomew’s (Harper Collins 2000) digital map data for Scotland.\nFigure 1. OASIS schema for Place and Artefact\nThe term ‘ontology’ has widely differing uses in different domains (Guarino 1995). Our usage here follows that of\nAmann and Fundulaki (1999), in that we see an ontology as a conceptualisation of a domain, in effect providing a\nconnecting semantics between thesaurus hierarchies with specifications of roles for combining thesaurus elements.\nThe OASIS schema (Figure 1) encompasses different versions of place names (e.g. current and historical names,\ndifferent spellings, etc.), place types (e.g. Town, Building, Port, River, Hill), latitude and longitude co-ordinates,\nand topological relationships (e.g. meets, part of). The schema is implemented using the object-oriented Semantic\n                                                          \n1 Art and Architecture Thesaurus; Thesaurus of Geographic Names\n \nlongitude \nGeographical \nConcept \nScope Note \nlatitude \narea \nString \nInteger \nName \nvariant spelling \nvariant spelling \n(Preferred Term) \nStandard Name \n(Non Preferred Term) \nAlternative Name \nDate \ndate \ndate \nLanguage \nlanguage \nlanguage \nTopological \nRelationships \nisA \nPlace \nisA \nmeets \noverlaps \npartOf \nArtefact found at \nmade at \nDate \ndate found \ndate made Object \ntype \nMaterial made of \nString description \n3\nIndex System (SIS - Constantopolous and Doerr 1993) also used to store the data, and which provided the AAT\nimplementation.  The SIS has a meta modelling capability and an application interface for querying the schema.\nFigure 1 shows the meta level classification of the classes Place and Artefact. As we discuss later in relation with\nRTs, relationships can be instantiated or subclassed from other relationships. Thus, meets, overlaps, and partOf are\nsubclasses of Topological Relationships. The information stored in the OASIS database can be accessed using a set\nof functions through which it is possible to find all information related to a given place, or to find all places with a\ngiven spatial relationship, or to find objects at a place made of a certain material. For example to find all the places\nthat are part of the City of Edinburgh, the system would return a set of all the places that are linked with a\ngeographical partOf relationship to the City of Edinburgh.\n                                           \nFigure 2. Classification of the axe artefact NMRS Acc. No. DE 121\nFigure 2 shows the OASIS schema for a particular object (axes are a common type of archaeological artefact in the\nRCAHMS dataset). OASIS implements a set of thematic and spatial measures that enables query expansion to find\nsimilar terms. Conventional GIS measures (eg zone buffering) could be applied in situations where a full GIS\npolygon dataset is available. However, as discussed earlier, there are situations where a GIS is not available or\nunnecessary. Consider the query Do you have any information on axes found in the vicinity of Leith? An exact\nmatch to the query would only return axes indexed by the term Leith (a district of the city of Edinburgh). To search\nfor axes found in the vicinity of Leith, spatial distance measures can be applied to expand the geographical term\nLeith to spatially similar places, where axes have been found. These places can be ranked by spatial similarity using\nthe part-of spatial containment relationship, which in OASIS is based on the spatial hierarchies in the TGN. As we\ndiscuss in Section 5, this relationship is a subtype of the hierarchical thesaurus relationship. Given the term Leith,\nthe OASIS spatial hierarchy distance measure would produce the list of places in Table 1, ranked according to their\nspatial hierarchical similarity to Leith. Some places such as Corstorphine, Edinburgh, Currie score highly, since\n(like Leith) they are districts within the region City of Edinburgh. Similarly, since Penicuik, Broxburn, Inveresk, etc\nare places in Scotland, they would be returned ahead of any axe finds in England.\nPlace Score Place Score\nEdinburgh`Leith 100 Midlothian`Penicuik 35\nEdinburgh`Edinburgh 60 Midlothian`Temple 35\nEdinurgh`Corstorphine 60 West_Lothian`Kirknewton 35\nEdinburgh`Currie 60 East_Lothian`Pencaitland 35\nEdinburgh`Duddingston 60 West_Lothian`Broxburn 35\nEdinburgh`Dalmeny 60 Midlothian`Leadburn 35\nEdinburgh`Ratho 60 Midlothian`Fala 35\nEdinburgh`Kirkliston 60 West_Lothian`Mid_Calder 35\nEast_Lothian`Musselburgh 35 East_Lothian`East_Saltoun 35\nEast_Lothian`Inveresk 35 East_Lothian`Bolton 35\nMidlothian`Dalkeith 35 West_Lothian`Livingston 35\nMidlothian`Borthwick 35\nTable 1. A list of places ranked according to their similarity to Leith using the Spatial Hierarchical measure\n4\nThe TGN also provides centroid co-ordinate data for places/regions – used by OASIS in a Euclidean distance\nmeasure. Table 2 shows the places of the previous table, now ranked according to their similarity to Leith using an\nintegration of the spatial hierarchical and Euclidean distance measures. In some situations (e.g. queries relating to\nadministrative responsibilities), administrative hierarchies may be quite relevant but not an overriding factor in\njudgements of spatial similarity and thus we provided a combination of the two measures. It can be seen in Table 2\nthat the rankings now also take account of Euclidean distance (for example Musselburgh compared to Livingstone).\nPlace Score Place Score\nEdinburgh`Leith 100 Midlothian`Penicuik 69\nEdinburgh`Duddingston 89 Midlothian`Temple 69\nEdinburgh`Edinburgh 88 West_Lothian`Kirknewton 67\nEdinurgh`Corstorphine 83 East_Lothian`Pencaitland 66\nEdinburgh`Currie 81 West_Lothian`Broxburn 66\nEdinburgh`Dalmeny 78 Midlothian`Leadburn 66\nEast_Lothian`Musselburgh 77 Midlothian`Fala 65\nEdinburgh`Ratho 77 West_Lothian`Mid_Calder 64\nEast_Lothian`Inveresk 76 East_Lothian`East_Saltoun 63\nEdinburgh`Kirkliston 76 East_Lothian`Bolton 62\nMidlothian`Dalkeith 73 West_Lothian`Livingston 60\nMidlothian`Borthwick 71\nTable 2. A list of places ranked using the Spatial Hierarchical and Euclidean measures\nEuclidean distance between centroid coordinates is less satisfactory for large area regions. Voronoi-based\ntechniques can be employed with limited centroid footprint metadata to yield a richer approximation of spatial\nregions. Our larger project has investigated this boundary approximation method, combining it with geographical\nthesaurus relationships (Alani et al. 2001). The method has the potential to assist a range of spatial queries.\n3. The retrieval potential of the associative relationship\nA thesaurus can act as a search aid by providing a set of controlled terms that can be browsed via some form of\nhypertext representation (e.g. Bruza 1990; Pollitt 1997). This can assist the user to understand the context of a\nconcept, how it is used in a particular thesaurus and provide feedback on number of postings for terms (or\ncombinations of terms). The inclusion of semantic relationships in the index space, moreover, provides the\nopportunity for knowledge-based approaches where the system takes a more active role in building a query by\nautomatic reasoning over the relationships (Cunliffe et al. 1997; Tudhope and Cunliffe 1999). Candidate terms can\nbe suggested for a user to consider in refining a query and various forms of query expansion are possible. For\nexample, items indexed by terms semantically close to query terms can be included in a ranked result list and\nimprecise matching between two media items is useful in ‘More like this’ options. The basis for such automatic\nterm expansion is some kind of semantic distance measure, often based on the minimum number of semantic\nrelationships that must be traversed in order to connect the terms (Rada et al 1989). For a review of semantic\ndistance measures and weighting factors that have been employed, see Alani et al. (2000).\nRTs represent a class of non-hierarchical relationships, which have been less clearly understood in thesaurus\nconstruction and applicability to retrieval than the hierarchical relationships. At one extreme, an RT is sometimes\ntaken to represent nothing more than an extremely vague ‘See-also’ connection between two concepts. This can\nlead to uncontrolled expansion of result sets when RT relationships are expanded and a potential loss in precision.\nRada et al. (1989) argue that semantic distance measures over RT relationships can be less reliable than over\nhierarchical relationships, unless the user's query can be closely linked to the RT relationship. The basic assumption\nof a cognitive basis for a semantic distance effect over thesaurus terms has been investigated by Brooks (1997), in a\nseries of experiments exploring the relevance relationships between bibliographic records and topical subject\ndescriptors. These studies, employing the ERIC database and linked thesaurus, involved strictly linear hierarchies,\nas opposed to tree hierarchical structures (as with the AAT) or indeed poly-hierarchies. However the results are\nsuggestive of the existence of some semantic distance effect, with an inverse correlation between semantic distance\nand relevance assessment, dependant on position in the subject hierarchy, direction of term traversal and other\nfactors. In particular, a definite effect was observed for RTs (typically less than for hierarchical traversal). An\n5\nempirical study by Kristensen (1993) compared single-step automatic query expansion of synonym, narrower-term,\nrelated term, combined union expansion and no expansion of thesaurus relationships. Thesaurus expansion was\nfound to improve recall significantly at some (lesser) cost in precision. Taken separately, single step RT expansion\nresults did not differ significantly from NT or synonym expansion. In another empirical study (Jones et al. 1995), a\nlog was kept of users’ choices of relationships interactively expanded via thesaurus navigation while entering a\nquery. In this study of users refining a query, a majority of terms retrieved from the thesaurus came from RTs (the\nthen INSPEC thesaurus contained many more RTs than hierarchical relationships).\n4. Case study of RT retrieval scenarios\nThis section maps key issues affecting use of RTs in term expansion algorithms for retrieval. Results are given from\na series of scenarios applying different versions of a semantic distance algorithm to terms in the AAT (AAT 2000).\nThe distance measure employed a branch and bound algorithm, with a depth factor which reduced costs according\nto hierarchical depth (Tudhope and Taylor 1997). It was implemented in C++ using the SIS function library to\nquery the underlying schema given in Figure 1. For the purposes of the scenarios, the threshold used to terminate\nexpansion was 2.33.\nOur aim was to investigate different factors relevant to RT expansion, rather than relative weighting of\nrelationships. The weights for this experiment were selected to reflect some broad consensus of previous research\n(see Alani et al. 2000). Our weights (BT 3, NT 3, RT 4), taken together with a depth factor inversely proportional\nto the hierarchical depth of the destination term, assign lowest costs to NTs and favour RTs over BTs at higher\ndepths in the hierarchy (following an AAT editorial observation that RTs appear to work better at fairly broad\nlevels).\nWe developed a series of experimental scenarios based around term generalisation involving RT traversal. Building\non the example in Section 2, we first focus on the AAT’s Objects Facet: Weapons & Ammunition and Tools &\nEquipment hierarchies. The initial scenario supposes a narrowly defined information need for items concerning\naxes used as weapons (mapping to AAT term axes (weapons)). In this initial scenario, expansion is limited and\nrestricted to NT relationships only (shown in plain black text in Table 3): tomahawks, battle-axes, throwing axes,\nand  franciscas.\nThe second scenario supposes an information need for items more broadly connected with axes used as weapons\nthus allowing for some flexibility in expansion. We first consider expansion only over hierarchical relationships\nand then discuss expansion with RTs. Table 3 shows results from BT/NT expansion, with semantic distance shown\nfor each term (terms in green italics result from expansion over both BT and NT relationships as opposed to strict\nNT expansion downwards from axes (weapons)).\nTerm Distance\naxes (weapons) 0\ntomahawks 0.6\nbattle-axes 0.6\nedged weapons 1\nthrowing-axes 1.1\nfranciscas 1.53\nstaff weapons 1.75\nsword sticks 1.75\nharpoons 1.75\nbayonets 1.75\ndaggers (weapons) 1.75\nfist-weapons 1.75\nknives (weapons) 1.75\nswords 1.75\nTable 3. BT/NT expansion only\n6\nTable 4 shows the effect of introducing RT expansion (new terms in blue italics). Staff weapons relating to axes\n(halberds, pollaxes, gisarmes) move up the ranking and are now below the threshold. Other new terms (such as\naxes (tools), chip axes, ceremonial axes) are also introduced. These terms could well be relevant to broader\ninformation needs or to situations when the initial thesaurus entry term was mismatched (for example, when an\ninformation need related more to tool use than weapons). In some situations however, the new terms could be seen\nas ‘noise’ and finer grained control of RT expansion would be desirable.\nTerm Distance Term Distance\naxes (weapons) 0 bayonets 1.75\ntomahawks (weapons) 0.6 daggers (weapons) 1.75\nbattle-axes 0.6 fist weapons 1.75\nedged weapons 1 swords 1.75\naxes (tools) 1 <projectiles with nonexplosive\npropellant> 1.77\nhalberds 1 adze-hatchets 1.9\npollaxes 1 hewing hatchets 1.9\ngisarmes 1 lathing hatchets 1.9\nceremonial axes 1 shingling hatchets 1.9\nthrowing axes 1.1 <cutting tools> 2\nhatchets 1.4 fasces    2\nfranciscas 1.53 Pulaskis 2\nchip axes 1.6 <ceremonial weapons> 2\nberdyshes 1.6 <wood-cutting and - finishing\ntools> 2.15\nstaff weapons 1.75 arrows 2.33\nsword sticks 1.75 machetes 2.33\nharpoons 1.75 darts 2.33\nTable 4. RT and BT/NT expansion - terms in blue italics are introduced with RT expansion\n7\nAs seen in section 5, the ISO standard and other reviews of RTs in thesaurus practice make a distinction between\nRTs within the same hierarchy and RTs between hierarchies (or sometimes facets). One method of achieving finer\ncontrol in RT expansion is to filter on the original term’s (sub)hierarchy - RTs to terms within different sub-\nhierarchies are not traversed. Table 5 shows the comparison with the previous example in Table 4. Terms in red\nunderline (mostly from the Tools&Equipment hierarchy) would now be excluded. Thus the effects of RT expansion\nwithin the hierarchy have been retained while the number of additional terms has been reduced. Other options are\npossible for semantic distance measures and term expansion in general. If information on facets and hierarchies was\nretained in thesaurus database implementations, it would be possible to weight RT traversal differentially according\nto the hierarchies/facets linked. On the negative side, note that in this scenario axes that are both tools and weapons\n(hatchets, machetes) are excluded, since due to the monohierarchical representation of the AAT\n2 they are located\nwithin the Tools&Equipment hierarchy. In many situations this will not be desirable.\nTerm Distance Term Distance\naxes (weapons) 0 bayonets 1.75\ntomahawks (weapons) 0.6 daggers (weapons) 1.75\nbattle-axes 0.6 fist weapons 1.75\nedged weapons 1s w o r d s  1.75\naxes (tools) 1 <projectiles with nonexplosive\npropellant> 1.77\nhalberds 1 adze-hatchets 1.9\npollaxes 1 hewing hatchets 1.9\ngisarmes 1 lathing hatchets 1.9\nceremonial axes 1 shingling hatchets 1.9\nthrowing axes 1.1 <cutting tools> 2\nhatchets  1.4 fasces 2\nfranciscas 1.53 Pulaskis  2\nchip axes 1.6 <ceremonial weapons> 2\nberdyshes 1.6 <wood-cutting and - finishing\ntools> 2.15\nstaff weapons 1.75 arrows 2.33\nsword sticks 1.75 machetes 2.33\nharpoons 1.75 darts 2.33\nTable 5. RT expansion – red underlined terms excluded when inter-hierarchical RT traversals are not allowed\nThe next scenario explores an alternative approach to control of RT expansion based upon selective specialisation\nof the associative relationship according to retrieval context3. The aim is to take advantage of more structured\napproaches to thesaurus construction where different types of RTs are employed. In some circumstances it may be\nappropriate to consider all types of associative relationships as a generic RT for retrieval purposes (as in the above\nscenarios). However, under other contexts it may be desirable to treat RT sub-types differently, permitting some RT\ntraversals but forbidding or penalising (via weighting) others. Thus heuristics may selectively guide RT expansion,\ndepending on query model and session context. The AAT is particularly suited to investigation of this topic, since\nits editors followed a systematic, rule-based approach to the design of RT links (Molholt 1996). The AAT RT\neditorial manual specifies a set of rules to apply to the relevant hierarchical context and scope notes in order to\nidentify valid RT relationships between terms when building the vocabulary or enhancing it. This includes a set of\nspecialisations of the RT relationships (AAT 1995; and see also extract in Table 6), following their notation: 1A\nand 1B) Alternate hierarchical (BT/NT) relationships (since AAT is not polyhierarchical); 2A and 2B)  Part/Whole\nrelationships; 3) Several Inter/intra Facet relationships (eg Agents-Activities and Agents-Materials); 4)\nDistinguished From relationship (the scope note evidences a need to distinguish the sense of two terms); 5)\nfrequently Conjuncted terms (eg Cups AND Saucers). We have extended the original SIS AAT schema to\n                                                          \n2 The AAT is conceptually polyhierarchical but is currently physically monohierarchical due to the original database software\nemployed in the project. There are plans to port it into a polyhierarchical data structure.\n3 This is in keeping with the recommendation of Rada et al. (1991) that automatic expansion of non-hierarchical relationships\nbe restricted to situations where the type of relationship can be linked with the particular query, and also with Jones’ (1993)\ndiscussion of using sub-classifications to help distinguish relationships according to strength.\n8\nspecialise the associative relationship (see Alani et al. 2000). RTs in our schema can optionally be treated as\nspecialised sub-relationships, or as generic RTs.\nTable 6. Extract from AAT Related Term Guidelines\nFor a full definition, see AAT(1995).\n1.

Whole/Part (2A) and Part/Whole (2B)\n     Note this relationship may or may not be reciprocal (eg, when a whole may or may not have a part\n      but when the part exists it is always part of the whole).\n     Eg) stalls RT-2B barns\n     Eg) fortifications RT-2A fortification elements       (the two terms belong to different hierarchies)\n3. Code 3 represents various RT links between hierarchies and facets. These include:\n3A Concept/User or Creator\n3B Concept/Resulting or causative Action\n3H Agents/Objects<hierarchies relating to location or setting>\n3J Agents/Objects<hierarchies relating to furnishings or equipment used by these agents>\n3K Agents/Objects<h. relating to products used or created by these agents>\n3S Materials/Objects  where a strong link exists between a Materials facet term and an Objects term\n3T Objects<h. relating to furnishing/equipment>/Objects/<h. relating to its location or setting>\n3U Objects<h. relating to visual/verbal work>/Objects/<h. relating to its location or setting>\n3W Objects<h. relating to furnishing/equipment>/Objects/<h. relating to related visual/verbal work>\n4.

RT link between two terms typically conjoined by AND but which ended up as separates\n       Eg) cups RT-5 saucers\n9\nThe editorial rules for creating specific associative relationships are not retained in electronic implementations of\nthe AAT to date. Therefore, for this experiment we manually specialised all RT relationships 3 links away from\naxes (weapons) into their corresponding sub-types by following sample extracts of AAT Editorial Related Term\nSheets and applying the editorial rules. Figure 3 shows the resulting visualisation of the concept axes (weapons)\nafter specialising the RT relationships – note the two different subtypes of RT. In the next scenario, the distance\nalgorithm was set to filter on the subtype of RT, only permitting traversal over the Alternate BT and Alternate NT\nrelationships. Table 7 shows the results (terms now excluded from Table 4 shown in red underline). The effect can\nbe compared with terms excluded by the hierarchy filtering approach in Table 5. This scenario might correspond to\na reasonably strict information request but where some terms located in the Tools & Equipment hierarchy were\nrelevant. For example, an alternate NT relationship exists between tomahawks and hatchets. Since they are classed\nas both tools and weapons, hatchets might well be regarded as relevant to the scenario. Terms, such as machetes\nand hatchets from the Tools & Equipment hierarchy were excluded when narrowly filtering on the hierarchy but are\nnow included. The specialisation permits the AAT to be treated as polyhierarchical for retrieval.\nFigure 3, an extract from the AAT’s Tools&Equipment and Weapons&Ammunition  hierarchies, focuses on the RT\nrelationships connecting the hierarchies\n4 – (see AAT 2000 for a display of the full hierarchies). Two different types\nof RT are represented. The AAT Scope Note for axes (weapons) reads:\n“Cutting weapons consisting basically of a relatively heavy, flat blade fixed to a handle, wielded by\neither striking or throwing. For axes used for other purposes, typically having narrower blades, use\naxes (tools).\"\nThus the associative relationship between axes (weapons) and axes (tools) is of subtype Distinguished From (see\nTable 6) and is not traversed in this scenario when filtering only on alternate hierarchical RT subtypes. We can see\nin Table 7 that the term axes (tools) and tool-related terms derived solely from this link (chip axes, cutting tools,\netc) are excluded. Under some contexts, such terms might be considered of relevance but in a stricter weapons-\nrelated scenario they might well be seen as less relevant and can now be suppressed. The point is that this control\ncan be passed to the retrieval system. edged weapons\nweapons\nAxes\n(weapons)\nBattle-axes\nthrowing axes\nfranciscas\ntomahawks\n(weapons)\nAxes\n(tools)\n<cutting tools>\nstaff weapons\ngisarmes\nhalberds\npollaxes\n  other staff  weapons …\nhatchets\n<wood-cutting and\nfinishing tools>\nPulaskis\nTools & Equipment Weapons & Ammunition\nBT\nRT (1)\nRT (4)\nEventual BT link up to Hierarchy\nFigure 3.

Filtering by RT subtype (alternate hierarchical RTs only)  – red underlined terms now excluded from Table 4\nOther scenarios illustrate the potential for filtering on other types of RT relationship. For example, an information\nneed relating to archery and its equipment, might justify traversal of AAT RT inter-facet subtype Activity -\nEquipment Needed or Produced. This would yield the terms arrows and bows (weapons), which could in turn be\nexpanded to terms such as bolts (arrows), crossbows, composite bows, longbows, and self bows. The same approach\ncan be applied to scenarios relating to parts or components of an object, using the RT Whole/Part, and Part/Whole\nsubtypes. Thus, a query on arrows (Figure 4) yields the terms listed in Table 8, using an expansion threshold of 1.3.\nAgain, for this scenario we manually specialised all RT relationships 3 links away from arrows into their\ncorresponding sub-types by following sample extracts of AAT Editorial Related Term Sheets and applying the\neditorial rules\n. The terms retrieved through Alternate Hierarchical RTs and Whole/Part RTs are shown in blue\nitalics and green italics (arial font) respectively. For example, note that subparts feathers and arrowheads are\nincluded in the results.\nFigure 4.

RT expansion: filtering on Alternate Broader/Narrower and Whole/Part subtypes\n5. Review of thesaurus relationship taxonomies\nSemantic modelling occurs in various computing domains. The standards for thesauri and related knowledge\norganisation systems in information science can be distinguished from the semantic structures common in AI or\ndatabase modelling (eg Brachman 1983, Storey 19935) by a particular emphasis on retrieval and interoperability\nacross different subject domains. A well established information science tradition6 allows software for collection\nmanagement, thesaurus representation and retrieval applications to be shared across thesauri in different domains.\nThe tradition rests on the core set of thesaurus relationships (equivalence, hierarchical and associative) mentioned\nearlier. The disciplining of semantic relationships to this core set makes possible the various aspects of\ninteroperability by providing a stable, manageable foundation for different types of application.\nTraditional use has tended to rely on human inspection of thesaurus representations, for example interactively\nbrowsing term hierarchies or manually looking up thesaurus displays in print form. Recently, with the growth of\nonline collections, we have seen a move to enhanced machine processing of thesaurus representations and this has\nmotivated a concern with extending the core set of relationships. Examples of these new applications include\ninvestigations of query expansion techniques in retrieval (Beaulieu 1997, Tudhope and Taylor 1997), efforts to\ndevise automated mapping between different thesauri for cross domain or multi-lingual searching (Doerr 2000) and\nproposals for RDF representations of thesauri for the emerging ‘semantic web’ (Amann and Fundulaki 1999; Cross\net al. 2000). Human interpretation of the context to infer the particular instance of a relationship type or tacit rules\nunderlying facet structure are no longer a resource in automated traversal of the semantic network. Support for this\ntrend towards an augmented set of relationships can be found in the ALA Subject Analysis Committee Final Report\n(ALA 1999), which supported a richer set of relationships, expressed in hierarchies, and also in the NISO Report on\nthe Workshop on Electronic Thesauri (Milstead 1999) which advocated a “core set of relationships, hierarchically\norganized” (but not any minimal set). A richer set of relationships would assist efforts in these new application\nareas for thesauri by allowing finer grained automated reasoning. It would also converge with work on broader\nontological conceptualisations, attempting to more formally define the roles played by entities in the schema (e.g.\nBechofer 2000; Bechofer and Goble 1999). However, there is a danger that an undisciplined expansion of the\nunderlying semantic model would lose the battle for interoperability. There is also a need for compatibility with the\nlarge number of existing thesauri (the Association for Information Management has a library of over 600 thesauri).\n                                                          \n5 Storey (1993) reviews the use of semantic relationships in data modelling and automated database design tools. She discusses\na taxonomy of seven types of relationships, including various partitive (meronymic) relationships, and derives guidelines for\nrepresenting them in a relational data model.\n6 The social aspect is also important; educational material and training practices distribute techniques for cataloguing and\nsearching widely and promote good practice. Standards must also facilitate the modification of knowledge organisation\nsystems, as the corresponding field of study evolves.\n12\nThe following discussion connects the case study discussed in the first half of the paper with possibilities for\nlimited extensions to the standard set of relationships, in particular focusing on the problems inherent in attempting\nto extend the associative relationship.\n5.1 Hierarchical relationships\nWe first briefly consider hierarchical thesaurus relationships. There are three commonly accepted subtypes of the\nhierarchical relationship (ISO 2788), which might form a natural second level of hierarchical relationships for\nconsideration in any standard extension of thesaurus relationships:\n1. Generic (subclass/superclass)\n2. Instance (class/instance)\n3. Whole-Part (partitive):  This is a hierarchical relationship between concepts of the same type, where ‘the name of\nthe part implies the name of the possessing whole in any context’. ISO 2788 allows four partitive cases:\n3a Systems and organs of the body\n3b Geographical location (as in our spatial query expansion examples in Section 2)\n3c Discipline (or field of study)\n3d Social structures\n5.2 Associative relationships\nAssociative relationships are more difficult to specify. The notion of distinguishing subtypes of RTs has surfaced\nfrom time to time, usually with respect to proposed editorial methods for asserting associative relationships\nbetween terms. The 1986 ISO Guide to establishment and development of monolingual thesauri (ISO 2788) gives\nexamples of several subtypes of the associative relationship, although these are intended to be representative\nexamples from practice rather than any definitive list. The Standard suggests that frequently one RT term will occur\nin any definition of the other (eg in a Scope Note). To prevent precision being unnecessarily degraded by RTs\nunlikely to be of practical use, the Standard recommends that a term linked by an associative relationship be\nstrongly implied by the other “according to the frames of reference shared by users of the index”. Thus RT practice\ncan vary according to the intended purpose of the thesaurus. The standard first identifies two types of term that can\nbe linked by an associative relationship: those belonging to the same ‘category’ and those bridging categories. In\npractice, category is usually taken to be a thesaurus hierarchy and thus the distinction is essentially intra versus\ninter hierarchy (as in the discussion around Table 5 in Section 4). RTs should not usually occur between sibling\nterms, since there is a strong hierarchical connection between two siblings. (However, it can be appropriate to make\nan RT between two siblings when there exists a particularly strong relationship between them which does not\nextend to the other siblings - the AAT RT subtype Distinguished From often relates siblings). Without intending to\nbe exhaustive, the Standard goes on to list typical examples of inter-hierarchical RTs:\nISO1 Intra-hierarchical\nISO2 Inter-hierarchical\nISO2a Discipline – Object of study\nISO2b Operation/Process  – Agent/instrument\nISO2c Action – Product of action\nISO2d Action – Patient of action\nISO2e Concept - Property\nISO2f Concept – Origin\nISO2g Causal\nISO2h Thing – Counter agent\nISO2i Concept – Unit of measurement\nISO2j Phrases – Embedded nouns\n13\nAitchison & Gilchrist (1987, p44) suggest some other RT subtypes in their influential explication of the Standard:\nPart - Whole7\nOccupation – Agent/Person\nMaterial – Product\nAction - Property\nAntonym\nIt is possible to identify broader groupings of the above associative relationships. For example, we might\ndistinguish broad partitive, causal, entity-property groups and a group corresponding to the AAT inter-facet\nrelationships. However, even this simple grouping includes overlapping categories, illustrating the difficulties of\ncreating a simple hierarchical arrangement of RT subtypes.\nAs an example of a highly specialised thesaurus, The UK National Railway Museum (part of the National Museum\nof Science and Industry) and Museum Documentation Association are constructing a railway terminology\nthesaurus. As part of this effort, we contributed a set of editorial guidelines on RT construction, drawing on the\nGetty AAT guidelines for RTs discussed earlier, which included a tailored version of the RT subtypes. The initial\nrailway thesaurus will comprise different hierarchies but will not be a faceted thesaurus. Thus AAT inter-facet\nrelationships were not relevant for the purposes of the thesaurus. The railway terminology editorial group agreed on\na similar set of RT subtypes to the AAT guidelines, but collapsed the inter-facet relationships to one shared\noperational context and also included a causal relationship.\nMedical information retrieval has seen a significant concentration of thesaurus related research, with influential\nmedical thesauri like MeSH (MeSH 2000) forming part of online databases such as Medline. The US National\nLibrary of Medicine Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS 2000) is a metathesaurus bridging over 50\nbiomedical vocabularies including different language versions of MeSH. A metathesaurus concept has attributes,\nnotably the higher level semantic type or category to which it belongs together with its hierarchical context in\ncorresponding source vocabularies. Examples of semantic types are Biologic function, Organism, Mammal. A\nUMLS Semantic Network defines 54 links (relationships) between the semantic types, the most common being the\nisa relationship which establishes hierarchies. There is also a set of 5 ‘non-hierarchical relationships’, themselves\narranged in a hierarchical fashion, which may be seen as serving the function of associative relationships in the\nmetathesaurus:\nThere are several relationships subsumed under Functionally related to, of which one is affects, which captures\nvarious relationships associated with medical intervention or interaction of entities – causal relationships are\nimportant in the medical domain. The affects relationship has six children:\n                                                          \n7 distinguished from the hierarchical partitive relationship in that the terms linked belong to different categories.\nPhysically related to\nSpatially related to\nTemporally related to\nFunctionally related to\nConceptually related to\nManages\nTreats\nDisrupts\nComplicates\nInteracts with\nPrevents\n14\nThus for the purposes of the medical metathesaurus, we have a semantic typing of concepts, more elaborate than\nthe structure of most faceted thesauri, combined with a fairly deep hierarchy of relationship types, specialised for\nthe purposes of the domain. Space and time are foregrounded as primary subtypes of the non-hierarchical set of\nrelationships.\nIn the library domain, a subcommittee of the American Library Association (ALA) produced a Report (ALA 1999)\non relationships between subjects and how they might be represented. There was a recommendation that systems\nshould include specific relationships with a view to facilitating the development of more intelligent subject access\napproaches to controlled vocabulary retrieval systems. In particular, Appendix B presents a hierarchical taxonomy\nof relationship types, based on Michel’s extensive review of the literature, with definitions of over 100 associative\nrelationships. In the taxonomy, there are 9 first level subtypes of associative relationships:\nThese are in turn broken down further, to varying depth. Two major subtypes echo the distinction made in\nISO2788: Different hierarchy associative relationships and Same hierarchy associative relationships, both with\nrelatively deep hierarchies. These are partially expanded below (note this example does not show details of\nsublevels for all relationships)\nCombined ideas\nConceptually related terms\nContiguity\nDefinitional associative relationships\nDifferent hierarchy associative relationships\nMeaning overlap associative relationships\nSame hierarchy associative relationships\nScope issues\nUnspecified associative relationships\nSame hierarchy associative relationships\nCausal – subsuming\nDependency\nGeneric Predecessor\nInfluencing\nInstigator/Agent-Process\nProcess-Method\nMaterial-Product\nClosely related siblings\nConsidered as relationships\nCoordinate ideas\nEntities studied in mutual relationship\nPart-whole\nPersons interacting in a social context\nProperty\nReciprocals\nSimilarit\ny\nD ifferent hierarchy (or facet) associative relationships\nEnvironmental – subsuming\nAbstract\nConcrete (subsuming position in time and space)\nEtymologically related\nProcess issue relationships (e.g. Producer-Product), Product-Material)\nProperty issue relationships (e.g. Process-Property, attribute relationships)\n15\nThis large set of RT subtypes constitutes a valuable resource. It is intended to capture the rich diversity of thesaurus\npractice, rather than forming any structured design proposal. However, the reason for the restriction of Causal and\nPart-Whole relationships to Same hierarchy is unclear. Some subtypes appear to represent fairly weak associative\nrelationships (eg Combined ideas, Conceptually related terms, Similarity), which might well be subsumed into a\ngeneric high-level RT relationship in any attempt at mapping to a core subset of RTs for retrieval purposes. Several\nsubtypes capture different aspects of closely, but not completely, overlapping meaning (eg, Meaning overlap, Scope\nissues, as does the AAT Distinguished from) and could be grouped under that broad sub-heading for retrieval\npurposes. A large number of relationships reflect pairings of concepts from different facets/hierarchies, which can\nbe seen as representing different semantic categories.\n6. Is an extended core set of associative relationships possible?\nThis (not exhaustive) review of RTs illustrates the practical difficulties in extending the current loose definition of\nthe associative relationship to more precise hierarchies of RT relationships. Medical thesauri stand at the more\ncomplex end of a continuum of thesaurus domains, which also includes specialised smaller thesauri which may\nhave no facet structure and only specify the 3 basic thesaurus relationships. If we include too many subtypes, then\ninteroperability of thesaurus mapping and retrieval software may be lost. In fact, it may not prove possible to create\none single extension of thesaurus relationships, but instead there may need to be different standard extensions for\ndifferent domains, e.g. medical, digital library, commerce, etc.\nHowever, one possible approach might be to aim for a limited extension of RTs at a second level and to expect\ndomain specialisation at lower levels. This would permit some degree of interoperability in advanced thesaurus\nbased applications involving automated traversal of a richer set of relationships for term expansion. If the three\nstandard thesaurus relationships formed the top level of a hierarchical structure then any such new applications\nwould retain compatibility with the large number of existing thesauri (and indexed collections) where it is\ninfeasible to augment the core relationships.\nMany of the taxonomies of RT subtypes discussed above have their origins in editorial guidelines for creating RTs,\nrather than being attempts at refining the semantics of RTs for retrieval purposes (our concern in this paper).\nTherefore, it may prove useful to logically separate practical heuristics or methods for identifying or creating RTs,\nsuch as the occurrence of one term in another’s definition or Scope note, from the semantic meaning of the\nrelationship. Documenting practical techniques for creating RTs is important but should be a separate activity. This\nmight also reduce the need for some RT subtypes, such as Definitional above\n8. As a very basic illustration, our RT\nguidelines (derived from the AAT editorial guidelines) for non-specialist editors constructing the railway thesaurus\nincluded the checklist in Appendix 1.\nMore fundamentally, we can also distinguish the meaning of a relationship from the semantic category (type) of the\ntwo concepts involved. In particular, the distinction between intra and inter facet/hierarchy relationships is common\nbut can lead to apparent illogical contrasts between and within systems. For example, should Part-whole and\nCausal-type relationships be assigned to one or the other, or both? Furthermore, in many systems, several subtypes\nof RT address various forms of relationships between categories represented by different facets, for example Agent-\nProcess, Process-Product, Material-Product, etc.) Rather than making an a priori distinction between intra and\ninter facet/hierarchy relationships, it may be more useful to foreground the category of the concept (term) as an\nexplicit aspect of the relationship in its own right. This would entail a hierarchy of semantic categories, with\ngeneric Concepts at the bottom level (default for terms in simple systems), belonging to various Hierarchies (and\nsub-hierarchies/minor facets) at the next level and with a set of Facets as the broadest level – see examples below.\nThe semantic category of a term  would be valuable to many applications automatically processing thesaurus-based\nmetadata.\nSeparating out the semantic category of concepts from thesaurus relationships is useful in its own right, but could\npotentially yield an additional benefit. If (following the faceted approach taken by the AAT editors) the semantic\ncategory of a concept is taken as a dimension separate from the type of relationship then a smaller number of inter-\nfacet RT relationships might suffice. The same Causal, Uses/Requires, Spatial or Temporal relationship might, at a\n                                                          \n8 It may be that editorial RT subtype definitions would be retained separately in editorial guidelines for constructing thesauri.\n16\nhigh level, connect various categories of concepts9. Conceivably, this might permit a restricted second level core set\nof RT subtypes to be applicable across some range of thesaurus domains (although this would need investigation).\nThese relationships could themselves be refined into richer subtypes when the purposes of the thesaurus warranted.\nWhile this could be seen as shifting effort onto the identification of standard categories or facets, it can be argued\nthat there is already a fair degree of agreement in this area.\nFor example, the ISO Standard refers to implicit categories of concepts which can assist an editor, say in\ncompiling hierarchies. Examples of general categories given by the Standard include Concrete entities (such as\nThings and Materials), Abstract Entities (such as Events and Units of measurement) and Individual entities\n(proper nouns). When such categories are represented in thesauri, they are usually identified as facets, each facet\nwith its own hierarchical sub-divisions. Facet analysis10 has been a longstanding technique in thesaurus\nconstruction; concepts are decomposed into elemental classes, or facets, which form homogenous mutually\nexclusive groups (Aitchison and Gilchrist 1987). Faceted thesauri or classification systems include MESH,\nBLISS, PRECIS and the AAT. For example, the AAT (Soergel 1995) is organised into 7 facets (and 33\nhierarchies as subdivisions): Associated concepts, Physical attributes, Styles and periods, Agents, Activities,\nMaterials, Objects and optional facets for time and place. Categories such as Agent, Event, Material, Object,\nTime and Place are likely to be common to many thesauri. As one possible example of an extended set of\nassociative relationships, Table 9 contains a broad grouping of RT subtypes (other groupings are also possible),\nwhich could be combined with a specification of a term’s semantic category.\nTable 9. Example of broad groupings of RT subtypes\n                                                          \n9 Simplification via the intersection of different ordering principles has parallels in other domains. For example,\nanthropologists have investigated how cultures organise and group the cognitive principles underlying social behaviour.\nTyler’s (1969) classification of the underlying semantic structures observed in cognitive anthropology, included the familiar\ntaxonomic hierarchical relationship. He also identified a ‘paradigm’ ordering principle, a non-hierarchical ordering which cuts\nacross levels of taxonomic hierarchies by multiple intersections. For example, the attributes gender (male, female) and maturity\n(child, adolescent, adult) intersect with a mammal hierarchy to yield concepts such as mare, colt, boar, etc.\n10 The faceted approach to subject analysis began in 1933 with Ranganathan' s Colon Classification (Personality, Matter,\nEnergy, Space and Time) and was subsequently elaborated by the British Classification Research Group.\nR T (Plain) for undifferentiated associative relationships\nM eaning connection\nMeaning overlap\nDistinguished from\nAntonym\nConjuncted terms\nCausal (taken broadly – many inter-facet relationships might fit here)\nDependency/requires\nUses\nProduct\nPatient\nand possibly Spatial and Temporal connections\nPartitive (taken broadly)\nConstituent parts\nAggregate group\nProperty/attribute\n17\nTo take examples from the AAT, RT relationships between Agents and Materials, Agents and Products, Materials\nand Objects might all be represented by Causal subtypes in the above grouping. The semantic categories of the\nconcepts involved further define the nature of the relationship. For example, an RT of type Causal/Uses (if the\ngrouping in Table 9 were used) could be applied to various AAT RT subtypes, provided that additional context was\nprovided by the semantic category of the concepts involved. An RT (of type 3Q: Activity – Equipment needed or\nproduced) exists in the AAT between arrows and archery. A specification of the relationship would include the\ncategories of the two concepts (Objects/Weapons&Ammunition/arrows and Activities/Physical Activities/archery).\nAn automated traversal application would at the least be able to ascertain that the relationship asserted that a\nparticular kind of object was used in an activity. The relationship could be refined hierarchically if appropriate for a\nparticular thesaurus. Similarly, a Causal/Uses RT could be employed for an AAT RT (of type 3T: Locational\nsetting – Equipment used or produced) connecting airports (Objects/Built Complexes & Districts) with aircraft\n(Objects/Transportation Vehicles).\n7. Conclusions\nIt may be impractical to expect non-specialist users to manually browse very large thesauri (for example, there are\n1792 terms in the AAT’s Tools&Equipment hierarchy). Semantic distance measures operating over thesaurus\nrelationships can underpin interactive and automatic query expansion techniques. Ranked lists of candidate terms\ncan assist query expansion or automatic ranking of information items in retrieval, thesaurus mapping and semantic\nweb applications.\nOnline gazetteers and geographical thesauri may not contain co-ordinate data for all places and regions or, if they\ndo, associate place names with a limited spatial footprint (eg centroid or minimum bounding rectangle). In such\nsituations, the ability to rank places within a vicinity according to hierarchical (or other) relationships in a spatial\nterminology system can be useful. Section 2 provides examples of the operation of semantic distance measures over\nhierarchical spatial-partitive thesaurus relationships. In contexts where administrative boundaries are highly\nrelevant, distance measures could combine quantitative and qualitative spatial relationships.\nRelated work has highlighted the contribution of RTs to thesaurus search aids but has noted the potential for an\nuncontrolled increase in result sets and a loss in precision (in cases where there is a specific search goal).\nExperimental scenarios (Section 4) exploring different factors relating to incorporation of RTs in semantic distance\nmeasures suggest a potential for filtering on the hierarchical context of an RT link in faceted thesauri and for\nfiltering on subtypes of RT relationships. Specialising RTs allows the possibility of dynamically linking RT type to\nquery context. In practice, it is likely that a combination of heuristics will be useful. In general, more control can be\ntransferred to the retrieval system to selectively traverse RT relationship or to weight them differently. The ability\nin retrieval to either specialise RTs or to treat them as generic retains the advantages of the standard minimal set of\nthesaurus relationships for interoperability purposes, while allowing an option of a richer set of RT sub-\nrelationships.\nWe have suggested the possibility of enriching the specification and semantics of RT relationships, while\nmaintaining compatibility with traditional thesauri, via a limited hierarchical extension of the associative (and\nhierarchical) relationships. This would be facilitated by distinguishing the type of term from the (sub)type of\nrelationship and explicitly specifying semantic categories for terms following a faceted approach. It may also be\nuseful to make a distinction between heuristics for identifying/creating RTs in thesaurus construction, such as the\noccurrence of one term in another’s definition or Scope note, from the semantic meaning of the relationship for\nretrieval purposes.\nThere are implications for thesaurus developers and implementers. A systematic approach to RT application in\nthesaurus design, as in the AAT, has potential for retrieval systems. Information (such as relationship subtypes)\nused in thesaurus design should be retained in data models and database design for later use in retrieval algorithms.\nVarious possibilities exist for the user to characterise information need. In future work, we intend to explore utility\nand usability issues concerned with the incorporation of semantic distance controls in the search system user\ninterface.\n18\nAcknowledgements\nAn early version of this paper was presented at the European Conference on Digital Libraries, Lisbon, 2000.

Example of checklist for constructing RTs (our extension of Getty RT guidelines)\nFor each hierarchy, starting at top in descending hierarchical order, take each term in turn and:\n1. Evaluate Scope Note for the meaning of the concept and key words representing it.\n2. Consider what possible Related Terms might exist:\na)    by being directly triggered from the scope note (or concept’s meaning) –\n        consider what RT subtype it would correspond to?\nb)    by taking each RT subtype in turn (see below) and considering if the subtype is applicable.\n       Make a note of which RT subtype code on Spreadsheet when entering RT details.\nc)    (as a final step) by quickly scanning through any likely hierarchies to see if a term suggests itself\n3. It is possible this may result in a strongly suggested RT term not yet in the thesaurus. If step 2 has resulted in a new\ncandidate term for the thesaurus, write candidate term memo.\n4. Check that the new RT link is not really an Equivalence or Hierarchical Relationship.\n5. Check that the Scope Note of the Related Term is consistent with the relationship.\n6. Check that all NT terms of the new related term are also valid for the RT relationship. The AAT followed a principle\nof ‘inheritance’ when making an RT. The RT should be made to the broadest possible related term and the relationship\nshould hold for narrower terms of the one related (but there is no need to make an RT link to each narrower term).\n7. Conversely, consider whether the source term is the appropriate term in its immediate hierarchy to make the link from.\nStarting from the top of each hierarchy will make the link from the broadest possible term. AAT guidelines suggest\nthat RTs work better at ‘fairly broad levels’ rather than narrow level terms (exceptions including when a deep level\nterm has no or few siblings).",
