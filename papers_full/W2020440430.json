Introduction \n \n High efficiency and a high degree of miniaturization achieved in switching resonant Class \nE amplifiers increase the scope of their applications including presently such areas as wireless \nenergy transfer, induction and dielectric heating, dc/dc converters, plasma drivers. electro-sur-\ngical generators, electronic ballasts as well as r.f. transmitters. Among different types of Class \nE amplifiers much research effort is devoted to optimise a Class E ZVS (zero-voltage switch-\ning) amplifier with a power supply choke and a series resonant circuit [1-5]. One of possible \nimprovements in this amplifier is the replacem ent of its supply choke with a finite dc-feed \ninductance. This also allows increasing load resistance and de creasing the amplitude of the \ncurrent in the series resonant circuit for given output power and a supply voltage consequently \nreducing power losses in the circuit [2-5]. The improvement is useful e.g. in on-chip UHF \nClass E amplifiers, where small inductances of nH range are usually required and discrete \n                                                           \n* This is an extended version of the paper pres ented at 13th National Conference on Electronics.  Dar-\nłówko Wsch. 09-13.06.2014, Poland. \n                                                                        M. Mikolajewski                                                   Arch. Elect. Eng. 622 \ncoils are often replaced by inductances made of  bond wires or copper tracks on silicon sub-\nstrate [3]. \n In many applications of Class E amplifiers it is necessary to ensure galvanic isolation of \nthe amplifier output from its input power supply source. This can be made by applying a trans-\nformer in the amplifier as proposed e.g. in [5]. The transformer also matches the amplifier load \nimpedance to ensure nominal or off-nominal operation of the amplifier for its maximum out-\nput power. The primary winding inductance of the transformer can be utilized as a finite dc-\nfeed inductance in the amplifier eliminating the need to use a separate dc-feed inductance \n(Fig. 1a). This reduces the number of separate inductive components in the circuit. However, \nthe transformer also in troduces leakage inductances, whic h modifies the operation of the \namplifier (Fig. 1b). These leakag e inductances have to be taken into account in the design of \nthe amplifier. If a transformer with high leakage inductances is used then also the inductance \nof the series resonant circuit in the amplif ier can be replaced by the leakage inductance L\n2 of \nthe transformer secondary winding ( LSR =  0 in Fig. 1b). Thus in the isolated Class E ZVS \namplifier of Figure 1a the application of the transformer with high enough leakage inductances \ncan reduce the number of used inductive components from three (a dc-feed inductance, a re-\nsonant inductance and a transformer) to only one  – the transformer. Such a reduction of the \ninductive components simplifies the amplifier a nd lowers its cost. This is essential for the \ncircuits operating in kilohertz and megahert z frequency range where discrete inductive com-\nponents are usually with a magnetic core, and therefore are often bulky and costly. \n However, the transformer Class E amplifier requires an analysis to find explicit relations \nbetween the parameters of the transformer, the amplifier nominal operation and obtained para-\nmeters of the amplifier. Published papers on Class E amplifiers with a transformer have not \nprovided so far direct design rules or equations for computing parameters and component \nvalues for the lumped-component circuit of Fi gure 1a operating in kilohertz and megahertz \nfrequency range [5-6]. The transformer Class E am plifier can find applications in low-cost \nisolated resonant dc/dc converters [7] and inverters. Some applications for the amplifier can be \nalso predicted in emerging VHF power circuits with air core transformers, which are usually \ncharacterized by high leakage inductances [8-9]. \n The paper presents a theoretical analysis of  the transformer Class E amplifier, a design \nexample as well as experimental results for the designed and built circuit. \n \n \n2. Principle of the circuit operation \n \n Figure 1a shows a simplified diagram of th e transformer Class E amplifier. The circuit \ncomprises a bi-directional transistor switch T1D1 driven by a rectangular gate waveform vGS(t) \nwith the duty cycle D = 0.5 and the frequency f, a resonant circuit with the capacitors C1, CSR, \nthe inductance LSR and the inductances of the transformer Tr with the winding turn ratio 1:n . \nThe secondary leakage inductance L2 of the transformer Tr along with the external inductance \nLSR, the capacitor CSR and load resistance RL form a series resonant circuit L2-LSR-CSR-RL \n(Fig. 1b) with a high loaded quality factor to ensure a sinusoidal shape of the output current iO.  \nVol.  63(2014)                                      A transformer Class E amplifier    623 \n \nT1 \n  \nTr\nD1\nVI\nCSR\nLP\n RL\n vOC1 \n(a) \nLS\n1:n LSR iOiC1\niS i1\nv\nT1 \n  \nTr\nD1 VI\nCSR\n RL  vO\nC1\n(b) \n1:n\nLSR\nLM\nL1 L2\niOiS i1 \nv \niC1 iLM\nn⋅iO\nvLM\nvL1\nVI\nL1 \nLM RL/n2  vO \nC1 \n(c) \nS \niS \niC1 \ni1  jX/n2\niLM\nvLM\nvL1\nv\niO⋅n  LR  CR\nvGS \nvGS \n n \n \n \n \nFig. 1.

The maximum value of PO RL/(n2VI\n2) for different k occurs at q = 1.412 [3-5]. \nFrom Figure 2c it can also be noticed  that as the coupling coefficient k  decreases the output \npower of the amplifier is reduced as well (see also Eq. (23)). Then to obtain a required level of \noutput power it is necessary to increase the amplitude I\nm of the output current iO. which in \nturn, can enlarge power losses. Thus, on the whole, a transformer Class E amplifier with k < 1 \ncan experience higher power losses if co mpared to its transformerless version ( k = 1) for the \nsame operating conditions. This issue is important for the special case of a transformer Class E \namplifier when LSR = 0 and it is expected then that k is rather low (typically there can be \n0.7 ≤ k ≤ 0.9 for a transformer Tr with a ferrite core). The low value of k (when LSR = 0) is \nnecessary to achieve a high enough value of the leakage inductance L2 and to obtain a high QR, \nand consequently the sinusoidal shape of the output current iO.  \n Figure 2d displays the pl ots of normalized capacitance C1 of the switch S versus q for \ngiven k. The maximum values of ωC1RL/n2 for various k occur at q = 1.468. If q is increased \nfrom 0 to 1.468 the value of capacitance C1 rises allowing the application in the amplifier tran-\nsistor switches with higher output capacitance. \n Figure 3a depicts norma lized series reactance X/R\nL of the series resonant circuit X/n2 – LR – \nCR – RL/n2 against q for given k. For LSR = 0 to obtain a reasonable high value of QR (≥5) the \nvalue of k is rather low and then X < 0 as shown by the dashed lines of X values for constant QR. \n Plots of normalized reactance of th e transformer primary winding inductance n2ωLP /RL \nversus q for various k are shown in Figure 3b. For q below 0.5 there is a fast increase in the \nvalue of n2ωLP/RL, which also means that then the value of the primary inductance LP \nbecomes high. A high-value pr imary inductance comb ined with a significant dc magnetizing \ncomponent in the supply current conducted by the primary winding can cause that the size of \nthe transformer Tr with a magnetic core can become large for low q and low k. \n In Figure 3c, the peak values of the switch voltage VS MAX and the switch current IS MAX nor-\nmalized to the supply voltage VI and the supply current II are shown, respectively. For the case \nof LSR = 0 the attainable values of the loaded quality factor QR versus q for various k are \nplotted in Figure 3d. As it can be noticed the QR values can be even above 10 for low k and/or \nlow q. \n \n \n \n3. Experimental circuit – design and measurements \n \n To verify results of the theoretical analysis  an experimental transformer Class E amplifier \nfor LSR = 0 was designed and built. Next, its basic parameters were measured. The given de-\nsign example illustrates how the equations from the theoretical analysis  c a n  b e  u s e d  i n  t h e  \namplifier design. The experimental amplifier was designed for the nominal operation with the \nmatching circuit CO ! RO (Fig. 4a) and for the following assumptions: supply voltage \nVI = 36 V, maximum output power POMAX = 100 W, the operating frequency f = 300 kHz, am-\nplifier drain efficiency ηA = 0.94, supply power PIMAX = POMAX/ηA = 100/0.94 = 106.4 W, load \nVol.  63(2014)                                      A transformer Class E amplifier    631 \nresistance RO = 50 Ω, the duty cycle of the gate voltage waveform D = 0.5. The transformer Tr \nwas built with a gapped ETD39/20/13-3F3 ferrite core (gap – 1.32 mm) from Ferroxcube and \na bi-sectional bobbin. Each of the two windings of the transformer was wound in the separate \nsections of the bobbin with a Litz wire 270 H0.071. The primary winding was NP = 20 turns, \nits inductance LP = 73.8 μH and the secondary winding was NS = 22 turns, and its inductance \nLS = 91.3 μH, which gave the winding turn  ratio n = (LS /LP)1/2 = (91.3/73.8)1/2 = 1.1123. The \ncoupling coefficient k of the transformer Tr estimated from measurements was k = 0.811 [12]. \nFrom Equations (23) and (24) one computes the parameter B1 = 2πωLPPIMAX/ VI\n2 = 2π×2π× \n300×103 ×73.8×10!6×106.4/362 = 71.76, which permits calculating from Equations (13) and \n(20) q = 0.5121, p = 20.224 and φ = !0.5244 rad. From Equation (24) for the circuit of Figure \n4a the load resistance RL for the nominal operation is equal to RL = (Rloss + RS) = n2ωLPk2B1/ \n(p2π) = 1.1123 2 ×2π×300×103 ×73.8×10!6 ×0.8112 ×71.76/ (20.224 2 ×π) = 6.309 Ω, where \nRS – series load resistance, Rloss – series loss resistance modelling all power losses in the \namplifier. The output current amplitude is Im = (2PIMAX/RL)1/2 = (2×106.4/ 6.309)1/2 = 5.808 A, \nthe series loss resistance Rloss = 2(PIMAX ! POMAX)/Im\n2= 2(106.4 ! 100)/5.8082 = 0.38 Ω and \nthe series load resistance RS = RL – Rloss= 6.309 – 0.38 = 5.93 Ω. From Equation (25) the capa-\ncitance C1 = n2k2B1/(q2p2ωπRL) = 1.11232 ×0.8112 ×71.76/(0.51212 ×20.2242 ×2π×300×103 × \nπ×6.309) = 14.57 nF. The parallel capacitance CO is used to match resistance RO to RS, and the \nvalue of CO is given by CO = (RO/RS ! 1)1/2/(ωRO) = (50/5.93 ! 1)1/2/(2π×300×103 ×50) = 28.92 \nnF. From (32) the normalized series reactance for the frequency f is X/RL = !3.12, which gives \nX= !3.12×RL=!3.12×6.309 = !19.68 Ω. The series equivalent reactance XS in the circuit in \nFig. 4a is found from XS = RO(RO/RS – 1)1/2/(RO/RS) = 50(50/5.93 ! 1)1/2/(50/5.93) = !16.166 Ω. \nTaking into account XS the series capacitance CSR is given by CSR = 1/(ω(QR RL + X S ! X)) \n= 1/(2π×300×103(5.16×6.309 – 16.166 – (– 19.68))) = 14.71 nF. The secondary leakage in-\nductance is L2 = (1 ! k )LS = (1 – 0.811)×91.3 × 10!6 = 17.26 μH. Hence the loaded quality \nfactor QR is computed as QR=ωL2/RL = 2π × 300 × 103× 17.26×10!6/6.309 = 5.16. The theore-\ntical peak values of of the switch voltage v(ωt) and current iS(ωt) are found from the waveform \nEquations (14), (17) as VSMAX = 3.572×VI =  3.572×36 = 128.6V and ISMAX = 2.843×II \n= 2.843×PIMAX/VI = 8.403 A. As the switch S an IR MOSFET transistor IRFB4115 was used. \nPolypropylene capacitors FKP1 from Wima were applied as C1, CSR and  C O, and their \nmeasured values were C1 = 13.94 nF. CSR = 14.35 nF. CO = 28.83 nF. The value of C1 in the \nexperimental circuit had to be lowered from its theoretical value to obtain nominal operation \nof the circuit because of the output capacitance of the appl ied MOSFET switch. The obtained \nmaximum output power in the experimental amplifier was POMAX = 99.97 W with the effi-\nciency ηMAX = 0.95.  \n The measured peak values of the tran sistor switch voltage and current were VSMAX = 136 V , \nISMAX = 8.2 A, respectively. The designed amplifier was also simulated using LTSpice with an \nideal switch and component values  as in the design example. The simulation results were \nPOMAX = 103.5 W, VSMAX = 134.5 V , ISMAX = 8.33 A for a steady state (after a hundred periods). \nFor higher values of QR (>10) the output current iO contains a lower level of harmonics and the \ndifferences between parameters of the simulated amplifier and the analytically designed circuit \ndecrease. \n                                                                        M.

Experimental amplifier with a matching circuit and its equivalent circuit (a), measured waveforms \nin the experimental amplifier for POMAX (b) and for PO = 4.8 W (c) \n \n \n The experimental amplifier was also tested with respect to FM control of its output power \nfor RO = 50 Ω = const. and VI = 36 V. The operating frequency of the amplifier was varied \nfrom 300 kHz to 357.4  kHz and simultaneously the on-time of the switch was adjusted (from \n1.67 μs to 0.46 μs) to assure its ZVS operation. The ou tput power in the experimental circuit \nwas regulated from its maximum value to 4.8 W with the efficiency decreasing from 0.95 to \n0.9, respectively. Thus this wide range of out put power control in the amplifier required only \n19% change of the operating frequency. \n \n \n \n4. Conclusions \n \n The results of the presented detailed analysis of the Class E amplifier have shown how the \namplifier parameters depend on some of the parameters of the applied transformer. A design \nprocedure for a transformer Class E amplifier with only one inductive component has been \nproposed as well as verified both experimentally and by simulation. The theoretical and \nexperimental results have agreed well enough to use the design procedure and the analysis \nresults for engineering purposes. The analysis can  be also used to design transformer Class E \namplifiers both with an external inductor in the series resonant circuit and without the inductor \n(L\nSR = 0). It is worth noticing that the analysis can be used to further optimise the transformer \nClass E amplifier by solving the presented equations for D ≠ 0.5 and the nominal or off-\nnominal operation of the amplifier.
