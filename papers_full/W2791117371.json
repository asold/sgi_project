  "abstract": "Lean Manufacturing is a manufacturing paradigm, when implemented, it gives an evolutionary change in the production environment.The selection of lean tools is the changing factor in implementing the lean strategy.Lean tools can be selected by prioritizing the lean tools depending on its ability to attack lean wastes.Lean wastes affect any production process.It is required to find the lean wastes at the earliest.This study was conducted in the steering knuckle manufacturing section of a manufacturing industry to identify the lean wastes in the production line.Lean wastes-Lean tools relationship matrix was developed to find the priority among the lean tools.The ranking method using weighted scoring method showed a new way of selecting the lean tools among the various options.It also provides a systematic procedure for the managers to select the right lean tools to reduce lean wastes.",
