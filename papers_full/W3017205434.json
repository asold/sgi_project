    "abstract": "This paper majorly concerns the classification of handwritten numerals of Devanagari Script. The major contributions in this paper are 1) Development of a dataset for handwritten numerals similar to MNIST dataset, 2) Analysis of Pattern Recognitions tools based on NN and Convolution Neural Network, 3) Detailed discussion on the results by calculating the Precision, recall and F-measure values and compared with the other dataset available online. The present dataset includes 4,282 handwritten numerals of Devanagari which are collected from people of different ages. In the methodology developed in this paper, all the numerals are extracted from the image. After pre-processing, the images are resized to 30X30 which are later converted to vectors. These vectors with labels are the inputs for the classifiers. ANN classifier is designed by using PRTool and Deep Learning network is designed to make comparison with ANN. Data for training and testing splits into different ratios – 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50. This research has achieved accuracy of more than 95%. The results of the dataset generated are compared with the dataset available online.",
