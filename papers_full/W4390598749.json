  "full_text": "COMMENT\nLocal climate services for all,\ncourtesy of large language models\nNikolay Koldunov 1✉ & Thomas Jung 1,2\nLarge language models can summarize, aggregate, and convey localized climate-\nrelated data to people in a cost-effective and expeditious manner. We have built\na simple, proof-of-concept prototype and argue that the approach holds the\npotential to truly democratize climate information.\nAs the global climate is warming rapidly, people around the globe need to consider climate change in\ntheir long-term plans. Examples include future-prooﬁng housing, evaluating business models, and\ndeveloping resilient infrastructure. It is relatively straightforward to obtain information on climate\nchange impacts at the global and national level,for example from the Assessment Reports of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)1. However, the impacts of climate change\nmatter most at the local scale. It is still a challenge to obtain user-focused statements on climate\nchange impacts that are directly relevant to speciﬁc applications and localities.\nClimate services have been introduced to address this challenge2,3. However, it is over-\nwhelmingly impractical for them (in their present form) to accommodate the vast array of\nclimate-related questions that individuals worldwide may have. In addition, the information is\noften not accessible to the general public without extensive training in climate science, geo-\ngraphy, and statistics. Services such as ChatGPT that are built on large language models (LLMs)\nshould, in theory, excel at broadening the reach of climate information to any interested indi-\nvidual anywhere on Earth, but are, so far, lacking access to sufﬁciently detailed local information\non future changes in weather and climate, and their impacts. If this hurdle can be overcome, it\ncould be a game changer in the effectiveness of adaptation efforts in a world undergoing rapid\nwarming.\nHere we present ClimSight, a simple prototype demonstration tool for such a novel climate\ninformation system. We argue that with a moderate amount of development and access to more\nadvanced climate model output— including global km-scale simulations— large-language-model-\nbased systems can provide actionable climate information to anyone with access to a computer.\nAn automated climate service\nWe built ClimSight to combine the strength of large language models with geographical\ninformation about the location of interest and climate information from model simulations.\nConsider an individual who owns a parcel of land in Morocco and contemplates its use for wheat\ncultivation. They are aware of changes in the climate, and concerned regarding potential impacts\non their agricultural venture.\nWe set ClimSight to work on the following query:“I intend to cultivate wheat. What are the\nimplications of climate change?” This inquiry pertains to a speciﬁc geographical point at approxi-\nmately 31.6912°N latitude and 8.1098°W. We present ClimSight’s assessment of potential climate-\nrelated risks and beneﬁts of the endeavor for this location near Marrakech, Morocco in Box1.\nThe machinery behind our demonstrator is relatively simple and currently relies just on a few\ndata sources. The input required from the user is the query and speciﬁc location, expressed in\ngeographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for the place of interest. Based on this ClimSight\nautomatically gathers two sets of data:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-01199-1 OPEN\n1 Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, Germany.2 Institute of Environmental Physics, University of\nBremen, Bremen, Germany. ✉email: nikolay.koldunov@awi.de\nCOMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT|            (2024) 5:13 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-01199-1 | www.nature.com/commsenv 1\n1234567890():,;\n(1) Information such as country, region, city and street,\nelevation, current land use, soil type, and distance to the\nclosest coastline.\n(2) Pre-computed global climate model output for the model\ngridpoint that is closest to the user’s coordinates from a single\nensemble member of the AWI climate model simulations\n(part of the Climate Modeling Intercomparison Project\n(CMIP6)4) for two 30-year periods, 1985–2004 for present-\nday, and 2070–2100 for a future climate scenario. The system\nextracts data for temperature, precipitation, and wind.\nOnce the information is prepared, we prompt the large language\nmodel with an explanation of its intended function and what kind of\noutput is expected. For this application, we have conﬁgured the LLM\nto serve as a localized decision-making assistant that evaluates the\nimpact of climate change on speciﬁc activities (see Supplementary\nNote 1 for the complete prompt). Choosing the most suitable prompt\nf o rt h i st a s ki sc u r r e n t l yr e l i a n to nintuition and experimentation, and\nrequires optimization through a process of trial and error.\nThe next step is to merge the user request with geographical\nand climate data. We do this by simply providing text with\nexplanations of what the data are and by giving their actual\nvalues. For example, for historical monthly mean temperatures,\npart of the request to the LLM will look like this:\nCurrent mean monthly temperature for each month: 8.58 11.205\n15.184 19.388 25.592 31.53 34.645 33.809 28.966 21.668 13.972 9.394\nThe completed prompt is then sent to the LLM.\nClimSight is currently quite basic: it gathers only limited\ninformation related to the place of interest; it only uses results of\none climate model simulation with relatively low spatial resolu-\ntion; and it does not take into account uncertainty estimates. We\nalso use the 2070–2100 period for future climate scenarios to get a\nstrong climate change signal over the whole globe for demon-\nstration purposes. In reality, most of the users probably will be\ninterested in the effects on the horizon of the next 10–30 years.\nEven so, ClimSight shows considerable skill in summarizing and\ncommunicating climate information and it successfully connects\nuser requests to climate change information.\nWe have assembled here three examples of the system that\nspan some potential applications. When queried about growing\nspeciﬁc crops, GPT-4 is usually able to retrieve general infor-\nmation on best growth conditions, compare it with climate\ninformation, and judge if it is a good idea to grow them in the\nspeciﬁed location (Box1). When asked about the installation of\nwind turbines in desert areas it warns about the potential impact\nof dust on blades (Box2). It can even give you hints on what\ncould be the best commercial activity for a particular place,\nconsidering future climate change (Box3).\nUsing ClimSight to obtain guidance on future projects is cost-\neffective: a query to ClimSight costs approximately 6 cents per\nquery using OpenAI GPT-4 API, once the underlying data and\nclimate model simulations are in place.\nFrom proof-of-concept to global service\nIn our view, there are two particularly encouraging avenues for the\nenhancement of our proof-of-concept prototype ClimSight that merit\nfurther elaboration. First, it looks promising to expand the information\navailable for the speciﬁed location, for example using high-resolution\ngeographical data and highly detailed climate information. Projects\nlike the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX),\nwhich downscale climate data for various global regions, can offer\nvaluable support in this endeavor for some regions. While CORDEX\ndata do not cover the whole globe, one can select CORDEX high-\nresolution simulations when they are available for the region and fall\nback to global, low-resolution simulations otherwise. However, if our\ngoal is to“deliver consistent localized information worldwide“\n5 and\nhence provide equal opportunities for everyone to prepare for climate\nBox 1 | Summary of the potential risks and beneﬁts arising from climate change for growing wheat in Saâda, Marrakech\nPrefecture, Morocco (31.6912N, 8.1098W), generated by ClimSight\nClimate impact on wheat cultivation in Saâda, Morocco\nClimate change could signiﬁcantly impact your plans for wheat cultivation in Saâda, Morocco.\nTemperature:\nThe current mean monthly temperature in your location varies from 8.58 °C to 34.645 °C. In the future, the monthly temperatures are expected to rise,\nwith a range from 13.17 °C to 40.88 °C. This increase can affect the growth of wheat crops, as they are sensitive to temperature changes. Wheat prefers\na cooler climate for its growth and development, with an optimal temperature for germination of around 12–25 °C. With the expected rise in\ntemperature, there could be serious implications for wheat production such as decreased yield and increased susceptibility to pests and diseases.\nPrecipitation:\nThe current monthly precipitationﬂux ranges from 0.01941 mm/month to 4.794 mm/month. However, future predictions indicate a decrease in\nprecipitation, with a range from 0.003157 mm/month to 2.608 mm/month. Wheat crops require around 450–650 mm of rainfall annually, preferably\nwell-distributed throughout their growth period. A decrease in rainfall could lead to water stress, impacting wheat growth and yield.\nWind:\nThe future u and v wind components indicate an increase in wind speed. High wind speeds can cause physical damage to the wheat crops, disrupt\npollination, and lead to moisture loss.\nPolicy and regulatory implications:\nIn Morocco, climate change adaptation policies are in place to support sustainable agriculture. The Green Morocco Plan (2008–2020) aims to\nmodernize agriculture and make it more resilient to climate change. It is advisable to align your wheat cultivation plans with these policies to beneﬁt\nfrom potential government support.\nRecommendations:\nGiven the future climate predictions, it would be prudent to consider the following:\n● Irrigation: Due to the predicted decrease in rainfall, consider implementing efﬁcient irrigation systems to ensure adequate water supply.\n● Heat-resistant varieties: Look into heat-resistant wheat varieties that can withstand higher temperatures.\n● Wind protection: Implementing windbreaks in yourﬁeld could provide some protection against the predicted increase in wind speed.\n● Policy alignment: Ensure your practices align with local climate change adaptation policies to potentially beneﬁt from ﬁnancial and technical\nsupport.\n(Please note, this analysis is based on the provided future climate predictions. It is advisable to continuously monitor local weather and climate trends for more\naccurate decision-making.)\nCOMMENT COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-01199-1\n2 COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT|            (2024) 5:13 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-01199-1 | www.nature.com/commsenv\nchange, exploring the utilization of data from forthcoming kilometer-\nscale global models, made accessible in the future through initiatives\nlike the EU’s Destination Earth6,7, will be imperative.\nSecondly, one current important limitation of the approach lies\nwith the limitations on the amount of data that can be trans-\nmitted in a query to LLMs as context. For standard OpenAI GPT-\n4, this limit currently stands at 8,000 tokens (equivalent to about\n32,000 characters), while the special version of the GPT-4, with a\nlarger context, become available recently. A promising avenue to\ndevelop our prototype further would be to exploit user-relevant\ninformation from trusted sources, including scientiﬁc publica-\ntions, reports, and local regulations, integrated into the ﬁnal\nprompt. Using several preliminary requests to the LLM toﬁrst\noptimize the level of summarization for any contextual infor-\nmation, both geographical and user-speci ﬁc data could help\noptimize the amount of information transmitted in the last step.\nMulti-agent conversation where LLMs with different roles or\nspecializations communicate with each other to achieve common\ngoals8,9, could be very beneﬁcial. Generation of several reports\nand letting LLM evaluate and select the best one could improve\nthe quality and reduce hallucinations.\nMany other directions for expanding the scope of the system,\nand adding more detail can be envisaged. Transitioning to open-\nsource models, such as LLAMA2\n10 can democratize ClimSight\ndevelopment by allowing more people to access, modify, and\nimprove the system. It is easier to furtherﬁne-tune open-source\nmodels (compared to closed solutions like GPT-4) and develop\nsector-speciﬁc extensions tailored to domains like agriculture or\nurban planning, or make a country-speciﬁc version. Fine-tuned\nmodels can be used to create separate, targeted services, or work\ntogether in one system to generate a better ﬁnal report. The\ncurrent simple extraction of monthly means for two periods can\nbe extended by more comprehensive statistical data analysis\ninvolving time series from many models, ensemble members, and\nneighboring regions. Visualization of data also can be expanded,\nshowing maps, statistics, and uncertainties.\nArguably more important than expansion, however, is the task of\nensuring that users are aware of the degree of reliability of the infor-\nmation they receive. Large language models can occasionally generate\nerroneous information and fabricate facts, and climate projections are\nsubject to their own set of inherent uncertainties and potential biases.\nIt would be important to make the reliability of the system’s output\nintuitively transparent, for example by providing a range of possible\nfuture scenarios rather than just one recommendation. Furthermore,\nincorporating information on local model biases, drift, and ensemble\nspread would add conﬁdence and trustworthiness to the recommen-\ndations communicated to the user.\nTo the next level\nUp to now, thorough assessments conducted by human experts,\nsuch as those assembled by staff from climate service centers,\nhave provided the highest level of precision and credibility.\nHowever, the scalability and cost-effectiveness of expert assess-\nments are becoming a limiting factor to consider.\nClimSight underscores the potential of combining high-resolution\nc l i m a t ed a t aw i t hL L M sa sat r a n s f o r m a t i v ea v e n u ef o rd e m o c r a t i z i n g\nthe dissemination of climate change information and supporting local\ndecision-making. Setting up artiﬁcial intelligence in the form of LLMs\nto work with up-to-date and innovative climate change simulations\noffers a cost-effective service that provides nuanced, location-speciﬁc\nguidance. This approach surmounts the traditional barriers of scal-\nability, expertize, geographical constraints, and usability that have\nhistorically impeded effective climate action at the community level.\nRepository of the projecthttps://github.com/koldunovn/climsight\nReceived: 11 November 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023;\nBox 2|Summary of the potential risks and beneﬁts arising from climate change for building a wind farm in Mezguitem, Morocco\n(34.4302N, 3.5123W), generated by ClimSight\nUser request: “I would like to build a wind farm”\nLocation: 34.4302N, 3.5123W\nClimate change impact on wind farm project in Mezguitem, Morocco\nBased on the data provided, your project to build a wind farm in Mezguitem, Morocco could be impacted by the changing climate in several ways.\nTemperature increase\nAn increase in temperature is expected in the future from the current average monthly temperature of around 14.3 °C to around 22.4 °C. While this\nwon’t directly impact wind turbine efﬁciency, it could indirectly affect the wind patterns. Warmer temperatures can change atmospheric pressure zones,\npotentially altering the wind patterns and speeds in your location.\nWind speed changes\nThe wind speed is crucial for a wind farm, and changes in wind patterns can signiﬁcantly impact the efﬁciency of the turbines. The data suggests a slight\ndecrease in the u wind component (west-east direction), which could mean weaker winds from the west in the future. The v component (north-south\ndirection) shows a mixed trend, suggesting some uncertainty in the wind patterns from the north and the south.\nHowever, it’s important to note that even small changes in wind speed can greatly affect a wind turbine’s power output. A decrease in wind speed could\ntherefore negatively impact the power production of your proposed wind farm.\nPrecipitation decrease\nA decrease in precipitation is forecasted. This is generally beneﬁcial for wind turbines as heavy rainfall can cause wear and tear on the turbines and\ndecrease their lifespan. However, a very dry climate might also lead to dust accumulation on the turbine blades, which can, over time, reduce their\nefﬁciency.\nRegulatory environment\nAs for the regulatory environment in Morocco, the Moroccan government is highly supportive of renewable energy projects. Under their national energy\nstrategy, they aim to have 52% of their installed electricity production capacity come from renewables by 2030. This includes a signiﬁcant contribution\nfrom wind energy. Hence, your project aligns well with the national policy.\nConclusion\nIn summary, while the expected increase in temperature and decrease in wind speed could pose some challenges to your wind farm project, the\nsupportive regulatory environment and the general decrease in precipitation could provide some advantages. It would be advisable to conduct a detailed\nfeasibility study considering these climatic changes to ensure the long-term sustainability and proﬁtability of your project.\nCOMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-01199-1 COMMENT\nCOMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT|            (2024) 5:13 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-01199-1 | www.nature.com/commsenv 3\nReferences\n1.

The soil type is Acrisols which are typically\nacidic and low in base cations but can be suitable for a variety of crops with appropriate management.\nIn the future, there is a projected increase in temperature and an overall increase in precipitation, particularly in the late part of the year. The wind\ndirection also seems to be shifting more towards the east and south.\nCrop recommendations\nTaking into consideration the local climate and soil conditions, the following crops could be suitable:\n● Cassava: This crop thrives in warm, tropical climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. With the projected increase in temperature, Cassava\ncould be a viable option.\n● Yam: Another popular crop in Nigeria, it requires well-drained loamy soil which can be enhanced by proper soil management. The high rainfall in\nthe area would be beneﬁcial for yam cultivation.\n● Oil Palm: Given the proximity to the coast and high rainfall, oil palm could be a lucrative option. It requires high temperatures and abundant rainfall,\nboth of which are present in the area.\n● Rice: With the high rainfall expected to continue, rice could be a feasible option. However, it requires careful management to prevent waterlogging\nor soil erosion due to the high rainfall.\nRisks and considerations\nThe increasing temperature and rainfall can lead to increased pest and disease pressure. Farmers will need to implement effective pest and disease\nmanagement practices.\nThe increased wind from the east and south might lead to erosion, especially during the rainy season, and could affect the topsoil fertility. Windbreaks\nor other protective measures may be necessary.\nThe soil type, Acrisols, will require careful management and possibly soil amendment to maintain fertility and productivity, as they are typically acidic\nand low in nutrients.\nLastly, Nigeria has a National Policy on Climate Change and a National Adaptation Strategy and Plan of Action on Climate Change for Nigeria. It is\nessential to align farming practices with these policies, which promote climate-smart agriculture and adaptation measures.\nCOMMENT COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-01199-1\n4 COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT|            (2024) 5:13 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-01199-1 | www.nature.com/commsenv",
