Goh & \nSun, 2016; Caccavelli, Krigsvol, Thamling, & Jaarto, 2005). \nLCC has been suggested as helpful as a way of thinking in \nstrategic management (Schaltegger, Müller, & Hindrich-\nsen, 1996). Thus, LCC is useful for including long-term \nconsequences from decisions, which in turn involves hav-\ning a strategic view on the product, in the case of this pa-\nper a property. While LCC has existed for more than four \ndecades and despite well-documented benefits of LCC as a \nmeans for including long-term economic consequences in \nbuilding investment decisions, recent research claims that \nthe adoption of LCC within industry is slow (Higham, \nFortune, & James, 2015; D’Incognito, Costantino, & Gio-\nvanni, 2015). Various barriers have been identified, such \nas lack of data (Oduyemi, 2015), lack of tool awareness \n(Olsson, Malmqvist, & Glaumann, 2015), short-term ho-\nrizons on building investments (Higham et al., 2015) and \nlack of knowledge on sustainability issues among practi-\ntioners (Häkkinen & Belloni, 2011; Olsson et al., 2015). \nOne way forward suggested by Häkkinen and Belloni \n(2011) is to improve the understanding about procedural \ndifficulties, who the involved actors are and their practical \nuse of these tools.\nEven though practitioners are the intended users of \nthe developed tools and methods, their views and de-\nscriptions of the practice of LCC are remarkably absent in \nthe research literature (Korpi & Ala-Risku, 2008). Thus, \nthe actual adoption and use of LCC seem to be taken for \ngranted as a consequence following the development of \nmodels and tools. The question arises whether or not the \nadoption of LCC really is as slow as claimed, or if there \nis a discrepancy between the way researchers idealisti-\ncally picture how LCC should be used and practitioners’ \n180 P . Gluch et al. From tool-making to tool-using – and back: rationales for adoption and use of LCC\nways of using LCC in practice. In a recent study about \nconstruction clients it was in fact found that the vast \nmajority used LCC within their organization (Gluch & \nGustafsson, 2015), which agrees with the interview ob-\nservations made by Olsson et al. (2015). However, Olsson \net al. (2015) found a large variation in the way LCC was \nused. Taken together, this points to a disparity between \nresearchers’ and practitioners’ perception about the level \nand type of use of LCC in construction and real estate, \nnecessitating the investigation about the practice of LCC, \nincluding practitioners’ rationales for LCC adoption and \na mapping of their uses for it in practice. Such improved \nunderstanding would contribute to a more informed re-\nsearch for LCC tool development as well as a more in -\nformed LCC use by practitioners in real estate companies.\nRenovation is an area for which LCC are particular -\nly applicable. Sustainable renovation is seen as a key for \nmeeting goals related to, for example, decarbonization \n(Mjörnell, Boss, Lindahl, & Molnar,  2014) and reduced \ntotal energy consumption of buildings (Ástmarsson, Jen-\nsen, & Maslesa, 2013). Renovation is currently also a ma-\njor challenge for Swedish real estate and property owners \nsince there is great need to transform an aging, energy-\ninefficient and unsustainable building stock in an eco-\nnomically feasible way (Thuvander, Femenias, Mjörnell, \n& Meiling, 2012; Palm & Reindl, 2016). There is therefore \nan increased need for life cycle perspectives during reno-\nvation processes (Olsson, Malmqvist, & Glaumann, 2016).\nThe potential for control over life cycle costs is claimed \nto be greatest in early stages of the design process (Higham \net al., 2015; Olsson et al., 2016), which is why real estate- \nand property owners in their role as construction clients \nare an important target group for LCC use (Opoku & \nAhmed, 2014). The client is repeatedly put forward as the \nkey actor and driver for the establishment of an active sus-\ntainability practice (Häkkinen & Belloni, 2011; Higham \net al., 2015; D’Incognito et al., 2015).\nThe aim of this paper is to improve understanding \nabout real estate- and property owner’s attitudes regard -\ning long-term thinking and how they use LCC in practice. \nMore specifically, the objective is to survey how they as \nrenovation clients use LCC as a tool for making renova-\ntion decisions. This includes an investigation of rationales \nfor LCC use on managerial, operational, individual and \ninstrumental levels as well as the role of LCC in decision \nprocesses for building renovation. The paper contributes \nwith valuable knowledge for researchers regarding the role \nand function of LCC in practice, thereby complementing \nthe large research streams on tool/method development \nand the case-based research that today dominate LCC re-\nsearch (Korpi & Ala-Risku, 2008).\n1. An overview of research: life cycle costing \n(LCC) development and practice\nIn theory, LCC and similar tools, such as Whole Life Cost \n(WLC), Total Cost Assessment (TCA) and Life Cycle Cost \nAssessment (LCCA), encourages taking a long-term per -\nspective in decision-making processes rather than a short-\nterm focus on lowering initial acquisition costs (Wood-\nward, 1997). For a comprehensive summary of various \ntools in terms of similarities and differences see Gluch and \nBaumann (2004, p. 573). Since investment costs are set \nagainst running costs over a longer period of time than in \ntraditional investment calculus, LCC enables choices be-\ntween solutions set in relation to a building’s full technical \nlife cycle. For an LCC to capture all costs through the life \ncycle of a building, it must include data on capital costs, \nestimated maintenance, operating and disposal costs, pre-\ndicted lifetime of the building and of various building \ncomponents (Olsson et al., 2015). Owing to the extended \ntime horizon in the calculations, it increases the impor -\ntance of how future uncertainties are properly addressed \n(Korpi & Ala-Risku, 2008), which is why assumptions on \ndiscount rates, alternative scenarios and cost allocation \nover time need careful consideration (Gluch & Baumann, \n2004). In short, there are many parameters with several \noptions, opening up for alternative approaches in practice. \nTo handle this variety, standardization as well as customi-\nzation have been suggested as strategies for promoting \nLCC application.\nGoh and Sun (2016) reviewed 27 articles in four key \nconstruction management journals and eight books. In \ntheir chronological review of LCC for buildings, they \ntracked and described the evolution of LCC. Although \nLCC and other similar decision support tools, such as \nWhole Life Costing, has been available since early 1970s, \nthe notion of a green LCC emerged around year 2000 \nand has since gained ground as ‘today’s mainstream LCC’ \n(Goh & Sun, 2016). LCC is often proposed as a way to \novercome deficiencies in current application of sustain-\nability considerations in decisions and actions (e.g. Park, \n2009). Goh and Sun (2016) noticed that although stand-\nardization of input parameters has been proclaimed since \nthe infancy of LCC, and in fact are available, there is still \na large divergence regarding assumptions on time and un-\ncertainty affecting predictions on future cost consequenc-\nes in the calculations. Thus, the greening of LCC is highly \ndependable on the ambition and purposive choices of the \ncalculator and/or user of LCC.\nIn another review on the intersection of LCC and \nmanagement/decision-making in the context of build -\nings and properties, Gluch (2014) covered 60 journal \narticles published between 2003 and 2013. She observed \nthat much research concerns tool-making, either various \ntypes of modelling (e.g. Brown, Malmqvist, Bai, & Mo-\nlinari, 2013; Ding, 2008; Morrissey, Meyrick, Sivaraman, \nHorne, & Berry, 2012; Flores-Colen & de Brito, 2010; \nSharma, Saxena, Sethi, & Shree, 2011), or method and/or \ntool development (e.g. Kirkham, 2005; Wang, Chang, & \nNunn, 2010; Love & Bullen, 2009; Kaklauskas, Zavadskas, \n& Raslanas, 2005; Junghans, 2013; Arja, Sauce, & Souyri, \n2009; Brown et al., 2013; Risholt, Time, & Hestnes, 2013; \nZhang, Platten, & Shen, 2011). Gluch (2014) noted that \nthe models often were multi-dimensional to capture the \ncomplexities of these types of decisions (e.g. Wang, Zmeu-\nInternational Journal of Strategic Property Management, 2018, 22(3): 179–190 181\nreanu, & Rivard, 2005; Ding, 2008; Sharma et  al., 2011; \nSwarr et al., 2011, Brown et al., 2013; Mjörnell et al., 2014), \nthereby reflecting an ‘objectively determined’ functionalist \nview towards application, similarly to what Rex and Bau-\nmann (2008) noted for the development and application \nof another life cycle tool, environmental life cycle assess-\nment (LCA). The LCC models, calculation methods and/\nor tools designed by researchers were then often tested \nin one or more real cases (e.g. Arja et  al., 2009; Brown \net al., 2013; Risholt et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011). Gluch \n(2014) concluded that most researchers justify their efforts \nwith practitioners’ need for ‘customized’ LCC, however, \nwithout empirical support about the nature of the need. \nThus follows a situation where researchers continue to \ndevelop methods that package uncertainty, complexity \nand bounded rationality into optimized monetary figures, \nwhile it remains unclear to what extent LCC actually sup-\nports practical decision-making.\nStudying the development of a customized LCC tool, \nLudvig (2013) found that LCC was not used in accord-\nance with the blueprints in the handbooks (e.g. Farr, 2011; \nDhillon, 2013) nor the standards (e.g. ISO 15 686 :5). She \nalso found differences in managers’ perception on the \nbenefits of using LCC to capture sustainability. Moreover, \nthe function of LCC differed across construction projects \nas well as between LCC users. Korpi and Ala-Risku (2008) \nmade similar observations from their review on LCC ap-\nplication with a client perspective. Several of the reviewed \narticles made complaints about the shortage of standards \nand formal procedures, despite the existence of commer -\ncial standards.\nBased on a review of 55 case studies described in aca-\ndemic journal articles, Korpi and Ala-Risku (2008) con-\ncluded that the current research is unhelpful for guidance \non how to incorporate LCC into practice. The case studies \ndid not build on previous LCC research discourse, result-\ning in a highly disconnected and fragmented description. \nMoreover, the reports on LCC methods were unsatisfac -\ntory concerning the reporting of life cycle phases consid-\nered, information sources used, cost estimation methods \nused and the nature of analyses done. A systematic un-\nderstanding on the usability of LCC was limited by the \nmajority of studies being one-off case studies in which \nLCC tools/methods were either developed or tested to \nconfirm the superiority of a specifically suggested tech-\nnical solution. Concerning LCC practice, Korpi and Ala-\nRisku (2008) observed that cost estimations were based on \nexpert judgement and analogy rather than on statistical \nmethods without going into detail. Also, deterministic life \ncycle costs were used in the calculations instead of sensi-\ntivity analysis. In half of the cases studies, uncertainty in \nfuture costs was not considered – in the other half, it was \nconsidered by using discount rate. Internal cost databases \nwere missing, resulting in calculations having to rely on \nexternal sources of data.\nThe literature overview shows tool-making’s respec-\ntively tool-use’s different views on LCC applications. \nWhereas tool-making seems to presume control of mul-\ntiple dimensions during application, tool use takes place \neven when data are lacking and with various simplifica-\ntions to the method. This raises a number of questions \nfor further inquiry. A first set of questions relates to real \nestate- and property owners’ attitudes regarding long-term \nthinking and LCC in renovation projects:\n – What rationales are presented as triggers for deciding \nto conduct an LCC?\n – How does long-term, life cycle thinking as integrated \nin project management routines affect LCC rationales \non different levels (managerial, operational, individu-\nal and instrumental)?\nAnother set of questions relates to the actual LCC \npractice in decision processes for building renovation:\n – Who makes the calculations and is the sender of the \nresults from it?\n – Who are receivers of the results?\n – Where do data come from?\n – Which assumptions are made and how is uncertainty \ndealt with?\n2. Research design and method\nA questionnaire survey was designed to investigate aspects \nrelated to real estate- and property owners’ attitudes towards \nand experiences of using LCC in renovation decisions.\n2.1. Questionnaire survey design\nThe questionnaire survey had 20 main questions, which \nfocused on three key themes:\n1. Life cycle thinking;\n2. Decision makers’ attitudes to the use of LCC;\n3. LCC practice in renovation projects.\nThe first theme of questions was used to identify two \nrespondent groups  – one that has integrated life cycle \nthinking in renovation project routines and one that has \nnot – which thereafter was compared to each other. Ques-\ntions about the rationales behind using LCC were partly \ndesigned in accordance with the Technology Acceptance \nModel (TAM) and partly based on previous research on \nbarriers towards adoption of LCC. TAM explains the \nadoption of various types of technical systems and ap-\nplications (Davis, 1989) and has been used to explain tool \nuptake in various types of contexts, such as office tools, \nsoftware tools and business application tools, as well as \nvarious technological systems and applications (see re-\nview in Legris, Ingham, & Collerette, 2003). TAM has in \na previous study been found useful for describing and un-\nderstanding factors influencing LCC use (Gluch & Gus-\ntafsson, 2015). In brief, TAM explores external influence, \nperceived usability, attitudes towards use and intention \nto use.\nThe survey results are structured on four analytical \nlevels, covering managerial, operational, individual and \ninstrumental rationales for adoption and use of LCC.\n182 P . Gluch et al. From tool-making to tool-using – and back: rationales for adoption and use of LCC\nRespondents’ opinions were measured using a Likert \nscale with a six-point range (4 questions), a binary scale \nonly with, yes or no answers (5 questions), several response \noptions (8 questions), descriptive information (2 questions) \nand ranking alternatives (1 question). In using a 6-point \nscale, we forced the respondents do be more thoughtful and \nthus becoming more discriminating when answering. It also \neliminates possible misinterpretations of the mid-point.\nSince a random sample of decision makers in the built \nenvironment would not produce sufficient results, purpo-\nsive sampling was done, aiming to obtain a broad repre-\nsentation of LCC use. The questionnaire was sent to indi-\nviduals working in 105 Swedish real estate organizations \nthat own and/or manage properties on a long-term basis \n(state, municipal, and private). The targeted respondents \nwere individuals likely to be involved in building renova-\ntion decisions and assumed to be in position to influence \ntheir company’s long-term environmental and economic \nsustainability. These were specialized energy strategists, \nCEOs, division managers, property/facility managers, \ntechnical development managers, construction project \nmanagers, or sustainability/environmental managers, de-\npending on the organizational structure.\nRespondents were identified in two ways. For nine \norganizations, contact persons provided a list of individu-\nals matching the criteria listed above. For the remaining \nmajority, we used Statistics Sweden’s business register, \nselecting real estate owners and real estate management \ncompanies (NACE code  68.2 and 68.32) with more than \n50 employees. Respondents were thereafter identified \nthrough each company’s official web page. This brought a \nfinal sample population of 217 individuals.\n2.2. Data collection and final population\nData were collected in September–November 2013. The \nquestionnaire and two reminders were sent by e-mail using \nan online questionnaire. The questionnaire was pretested \nby two managers in order to identify and reduce potential \nmisinterpretations. For the same reason, an instructional \ncover letter with detailed information about the study was \npresented in the e-mail and the questionnaire document.\nResponses were obtained from 96 individuals of the \nsample of 217. 66 respondents answered questions pertain-\ning to all three themes. 42 respondents with practical ex-\nperience of LCC in a renovation project took the part of \nthe questionnaire elaborating on their LCC use in practice.\nThe distribution of the respondents’ occupational title \nwas as follows: construction project manager (32%), sus-\ntainability/environmental manager (19%), CEO/division \nmanager (14%), technical development manager (14%), \nproperty manager (12%), and energy strategist (9%).\nThe analysis was conducted using SPSS®. For Likert scale \nvariables, mean values were calculated. The robustness of us-\ning parametric testing on data from Likert scales have been \ndemonstrated in previous research (Carifio & Perla, 2007).\n3. Results and analysis\nThis results presents rationales behind using LCC on \nmanagerial, operational, individual and instrumental lev-\nels. Descriptive data are presented in terms of mean val-\nues for all respondents. In the analysis, the respondents \nwere divided into two groups depending on if they have \nincluded life cycle management into their project man-\nagement routines (group A) or not (group B). 60% of the \nrespondents belong to group A and 40% to group B. This \nenables us to investigate if this integration has had effect \non attitudes towards adopting LCC. For the investigation \nof actual LCC practice, the results also present how real \nestate- and property owners conduct an LCC in renova-\ntion projects. This includes questions such as; who makes \nthe calculations, who are receiver of the LCC calculations, \nand what assumptions are made and what key input pa-\nrameters are used.\n3.1. Life-cycle thinking in project management routines\nIntegration of life-cycle thinking in procedures for project \nmanagement depended on the extent to which long-term \nsolutions were favoured in the organisation but also on \nproject managers’ opportunities to contribute to long-\nterm strategic decisions and ability to have an overview, \nas well as the project team’s knowledge (Table 1).\nTable 1. Stated reasons for having or not having integrated life-cycle thinking in procedures for project management\nQuestion\nYe s No\nN M Sd N M Sd\nKnowledge is in the project team* 60 4.54 .91 38 3.82 1.58\nProject managers actively contribute to the organization’s \nlong-term strategic decisions*\n60 4.53 .93 37 3.57 1.57\nProject managers have necessary overview* 60 4.21 .96 38 3.79 1.51\nProject management functions and strategic functions are \nintegrated with each other\n60 3.97 1.28 37 3.76 1.42\nRunning operation costs for facility management is \ntreated jointly with long-term investment costs*\n60 4.28 1.35 36 2.78 1.71\nLong-term solutions are favoured* 60 4.55 1.14 37 4.14 1.77\n* Difference significant at p<.05 using t-test.\nFor the No group questions were phrased in a negating form (values then reversed for comparison). The scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 \n(strongly agree).\nInternational Journal of Strategic Property Management, 2018, 22(3): 179–190 183\nRegarding integration of life-cycle thinking in project \nmanagement routines, there was a statistically significant \ndifference between the two groups for all statements ex-\ncept: Project Management functions and strategic functions \nare integrated with each other. Favouring long-term solu-\ntions is valued higher among group A than the B group. \nThe project team and the project manager’s knowledge \nare also valued as more important within group A than \nfor group B. In addition, project managers’ opportunity \nto actively contribute to the organization’s long-term stra-\ntegic decisions was valued higher in group A. Thus, good \nunderstanding and knowledge of these issues within the \nproject team is seen as key to greater long-term emphasis \nin renovation projects. For group B, integrated handling \nof operation costs and investment costs (different bags of \nmoney) scored the lowest, indicating that this may be a \ncause of integration not taking place (Table 1).\n3.2. Extent of LCC use in property owners’ \nrenovation projects\nA large majority (64%) of respondents (N=93) indicate \nthat LCC has been used or discussed within the organiza-\ntion only within the past 5 years. Of these 5% less than a \nyear. 23% state LCC has been known within the organiza-\ntion longer than 5 years but less than 15 years. Only 5% \nstate that it has been known longer than 15 years. Nine \npercent of the respondent state that LCC is neither used \nnor discussed in their organization.\nWhen it comes to the number of renovation projects \nwhere LCC calculations were used as part of the deci -\nsion support foundation (N=83), respondents answered \nacross the entire scale. One third, 33%, indicate that they \nin more than 50% of projects have used LCC. 4% of these \nstates they use LCC in all project. About one fourth of the \nrespondents, 24%, reported that more than 25% but less \nthan 50% of the projects consider LCC. 38% answered that \nLCC calculations are done in less than 25% of the projects. \nTo this question, 5% of the respondents, state that they do \nnot calculate LCC in any construction project at all. An \nanalysis of answers to these two questions on time and \nnumber of projects shows a possible relation between how \nlong LCC has been a known subject in the organization, \nand the proportion of renovation projects where it is actu-\nally applied (r=.20, p=.07).\n3.3. Rationales for adopting LCC\nThe results are structured in relation to rationales on four \nanalytical levels; managerial, operational, individual and \ninstrumental.\nManagerial level\nUse of different types of tools often respond to demands \nfrom the organization or the industry. The mean value \nfor the total dataset presented in Table 2 shows that there \nis no impact variable on managerial level that stands out \nas extraordinary in terms of driving the use of LCC in a \nrenovation context. There are individual variations within \nthe results but in terms of mean value the influence from \nexternal impact variables are moderate. That the organiza-\ntion and/or management advocate the use of LCC stands \nout as significantly more influential for group A than for \ngroup B. This is also the case for rationales driven by re-\nquirements and managerial demands. There also seems to \nbe a driving effect that other colleagues and others in the \nindustry use LCC. The latter is especially seen as a ration-\nale for group B.\nOperational level\nThe respondents were asked to indicate how they felt \nabout different statements related to the usefulness of \nconducting an LCC in their daily work. From the results \npresented in Table 3 we can see that there seem to be quite \ngood conditions for the use of LCC. Lack of resources in \nterms of finance and time, often highlighted in research as \nobstacles for a wider use of LCC, seem not be perceived \nas a major problem in our survey. It should be noted that \ngroup A sees statistically less hindrance due to time and \nmoney than group B. The actual terminology and appara-\ntus of LCC is at least partly considered as consistent and \nfamiliar for many of the respondents, especially for group \nA although the difference is not statistically significant. \nGroup A believes that the idea of LCC lies rather well in \nline with how they normally work while group B believe \nless so. LCC is for both groups considered to be sufficiently \nflexible. In addition, LCC is also perceived to make it easi-\ner to identify key information needed when making deci-\nsions on renovation of buildings and properties. This is \nespecially forwarded as a rationale for group B. However, \nTable 2.

Gluch et al. From tool-making to tool-using – and back: rationales for adoption and use of LCC\nthis is somewhat contradictory since they state that they \nare less familiar with the LCC terminology than Group A. \nThe two groups also differ in respect to perceived lack of \ncooperation between involved parties were Group B tend \nto see this as more of an obstacle than group A.\nInstrumental level\nTable  4 shows that respondents believe LCC serves a \nrelatively large number of functions in the organization’s \ndecision-making processes. Several of these can be linked \nto a key idea and the textbook picture of how LCC can \nbe used, that is, identifying the most cost effective choice \nin a long-term perspective and give a comparative eco-\nnomic view of the various investment options. LCC are \nalso believed to consider energy costs and enable long-\nterm planning.\nMoreover, side effects such as greater credibility for \nthe decision, facilitator of communication and learning \neffects, are also seen as resulting from using LCC. The \nlowest rated function is using LCC in negotiations, as \nchecklist and for monitoring on-going projects. The two \ngroups have a rather coherent view on LCCs instrumen-\ntal function and only differ statistically in regard to LCCs \nrole for internal discussions about renovation and LCC as \nmean to steer investments into a desired direction. Group \nB sees these effects from LCC as less prominent.\nTable 3.

The respondents especially agree to the statement \nthat they like the actual idea of LCC and that LCC repre-\nsents something valuable for them. They also perceive that \nLCC is a suitable tool in their work and that LCC provides \nthem with relevant information. Thus, the results indicate \nthat there seem to be fairly good conditions for a more \nwidely use of LCC in renovation projects, both regarding \nusers’ qualifications and the LCC tool itself.\nThe individual rationales for using LCC cohere across \nthe two respondent groups A and B and the results shows \nno statistically significant differences due to life cycle in-\ntegration in project management routine.\n3.4. LCC practice in building renovation projects\nAnswering questions related to LCC practice in building \nrenovation projects the respondents were asked to consid-\ner a recently completed renovation project they had been \ninvolved in and use this to base their answers on.\nSender and receiver of LCC results\nAmong the respondents (N=42) that answered that they \nperformed an LCC in a renovation project, sixty-one per-\ncent of the respondents stated that they used an LCC tool \ndeveloped in-house of their organization. Of these, 7% \nreported they used a tool developed by their own project \nteam and 53% reported using a tool developed elsewhere \nin their organization. 26% reported they used a publicly \navailable computational tool. 7% stated they did not use \nany specific calculation tool and equally many that they do \nnot know what tool that was used.\nThe results show that construction project manag-\ners are identified as key participants in the processes of \ndeveloping decision support for renovation projects (see \nTable  6). The organization’s internal energy coordinator \nand the facilities manager are also involved in these pro-\ncesses. Building design managers and consulting installa-\ntion engineers are also involved to a relatively high degree. \nEnvironmental managers and environmental consultants \nand also financial officers come into play to a lesser extent. \nPoliticians and authorities are not seen as important par -\nticipants in the process. Neither is the building contractor \ninvolved while participation is somewhat more likely for \narchitects and consulting building engineers.\nOf those respondents who stated that an LCC calcu-\nlation was made, 41% answered that the unit or group \nthey belonged to did the calculation. 26% stated it was \nsomeone else in their organization that performed the cal-\nculation and 21% hired a consultant for the calculation. \nTwelve percent stated that they did it by themselves.\nThe respondents were also asked to state whom they \nviewed as receivers of the results (Table 7). It is interest-\ning to note that one of LCC’s most important functions \nis reported to be establishing greater credibility for the \ndecision (see Table 4), while respondents also report they \nthemselves or their own project team are the primary re-\ncipients of LCC calculation results.

Gluch et al. From tool-making to tool-using – and back: rationales for adoption and use of LCC\nand accountants/auditors are ranked much lower. LCC \nand LCC calculations are thus primarily viewed as in-\nhouse project tools.\nKey input parameters used in LCC calculation\nRegarding the source for input data, 35% of the respond-\nents stated they primarily used estimates based on the \nproject team’s previous experience. 30% stated they per -\nformed a one-off thorough inventory specifically for the \nrenovation project in hand. A smaller number said they \ndownloaded historical data from in-house databases (19%) \nand even fewer used general industry template data (7%).\nThe length of lifetime selected strongly impacts the \nLCC calculation. The longer this is, the greater the uncer -\ntainty built into the calculation. But, shorter lifetimes risk \nmissing a majority of costs with long-term significance. \nThe survey finds that a majority of respondents state they \nuse a lifetime longer than 21 years in their LCC calcula-\ntion (53%). 30% indicate they use 11–20 years, and 9% \n4–10 years. No answers were for 1–3 years, and 7% said \nthey do not know the lifetime used.\nThe discount rate used in an LCC calculation has sig-\nnificant impact on the results, especially when using a \npresent value method to compare cash flows over time. \nThe higher the discount rate, the lower the value of future \ncosts in the calculation. In literature, some researchers use \na zero percent discount for environmental investments, ar-\nguing that future costs will have a value equal to the cost \nthat would be due if the payment were made today. Others \nadvocate that different discount rates should be used for \ndifferent cost items depending on the future environmen-\ntal impact of that particular item. None of the respondents \nindicated they used a zero percent discount rate. An over-\nwhelming majority (68%) used a rate set centrally in their \norganization for investments in general, that is, the same \nrate used for a standard investment calculation with short \ntime perspectives. A few respondents used an industry-\nwide standard rate (5%) and a similar number used a cal-\nculation method that does not consider cost of capital, as \nwith the payback method. 12% of respondents indicated \nthey considered cost of capital as a variable for application \nin sensitivity analyses. 12% of respondents answered that \nthey did not know the interest rate used. An observation \nhere is that the option to vary the interest rate depending \non project type, which nearly 25% agreed was preferable, \nwould involve some kind of negotiation as to the interest \nrate used. However, no respondents stated the discount \nrate was set through a negotiation process.\nDiscussion and conclusion\nThis study shows that real estate- and property owners in \ngeneral have a positive attitude towards life cycle think-\ning. LCC is perceived as a valuable and suitable tool and \nprovider of increased control in renovation investment \nsituations. As instrumental rationale for using LCC, the \nrespondents mention LCC’s ability to offer a comparative \nbasis for different investment solutions, that the calcula-\ntion results show the most cost effective solutions in a \nlong-term perspective and indicate rising energy costs. \nAll above is consistent with LCC’s built-in theoretical eco-\nnomics logic and demonstrates that LCC is indeed viewed \nas the financial instrument suggested in literature (Farr, \n2011; Dhillon, 2013). On an operational level, LCC is per-\nceived as having many different functions and thus pro-\nviding enough flexibility for practical use in a renovation \ncontext. A consistent and familiar terminology was also a \nstrong rationale for using LCC. Increased time and costs \nfor applying and using LCC are often described as barri-\ners for sustainability practices (Häkkinen & Belloni, 2011; \nOpoku & Ahmed, 2014), but were not seen as major bar -\nriers here, especially not among the group that included \nlife-cycle thinking into their project management routines.\nDividing the respondents into two groups depending \non if they have included life cycle management into their \nproject management routines (group A) or not (group B), \nenabled us to investigate if this integration has had effect \non attitudes towards LCC. Figure 1 present perceived ra-\ntionales for LCC use where there are statistically signifi-\ncant differences between the two groups. In general group \nB tends to see more hindrances than group A that feels \nthat using LCC aligns well with how they work. This is for \nexample mirrored in the instrumental function on LCC, \nwhere group A considers it more useful to direct invest-\nment decisions than group B.\nThe results show that managerial rationales in terms of \nthe extent to which LCC is advocated and used by others \naffects the extent to which LCC is used. Comparing group \nA and B, the first is foremost driven by management di -\nrectives and internal demands while the latter seem to be \nindustry driven. Group A also sees knowledge in project \nteam and involved project managers together with that \nlong-term perspectives and solutions is favored within \nthe organization as key reasons to the adoption of LCC in \nTable 7.

The above tells us that to increase \nthe use of LCC, as well as a having a realistic idea what \nLCC can do or not, companies should strive to establish \na culture that advocates a continuous use of LCC, both \nwithin the organization but also through joint industry \ninitiatives.\nAlthough the respondents have a general positive \nattitude towards LCC, and perhaps also expectations \nof what it can do, our results display a fragmented and \nundeveloped view on how LCC is used in practice. This \nreveals that the attractiveness of LCC rather relates to a \nsense of familiarity with the economic format than getting \nwell-grounded calculation results (cf. Gluch & Baumann, \n2004). The awareness regarding effects from assumptions \nmade in the financial analysis seems inadequate and the \nuse of LCC simplistic in comparison to the tools devel-\noped and proposed in research literature. The calculations, \nfor example, were built on rough cost estimates based on \n‘common sense’ within foremost a closed project team, \na general discount rate for all kinds of investments was \nused, and sensitivity analysis to account for future un-\ncertainty was seldom applied. In addition, in many cases \nthe project teams performed their own LCC calculation \nwhile at the same time being the primary recipients of \nthe results from it. Although less familiar with the LCC \nterminology and in general more hesitant to LCC use, \nGroup B seem to like the actual idea of LCC more than \ngroup A. The reason behind this cannot be determined \nbased on the study. However, a possible explanation might \nbe that this reflects an even more immature and idealis-\ntic view on LCC among group B than with Group A. A \nview that maybe has started to be challenged for Group \nA respondents when incorporating LCC in their project \nmanagement routines.\nProject managers and energy managers were viewed \nas the most influential parties in the decision-making \nprocesses, whereas environmental and financial managers \nhad limited involvement, which further adds to a naivety \nin its use as a financial accounting instrument. Similar \nto Olsson et al. (2015) and Ludvig, Stenberg, and Gluch  \n(2013) we conclude that the ways sustainability issues are \naddressed in renovation decisions may largely depend on \nthe skills and wills of individual project managers.\nOur findings also confirm what has previously been \nshown, that individuals across the industry have devel-\noped their own way of conducting an LCC (Olubodun, \nKangwa, Oladapo, & Thompson, 2010). Taken together, \nwe discern a self-supportive pattern, where LCC is per -\nformed by the project group to legitimize decisions and \nstrengthen support for a preferred design solution. Even \nif LCC attempt to capture costs across an entire life cycle, \ndecisions still risk failing to consider perspectives of vari-\nous stakeholders involved in a renovation project (Swarr \net al., 2011). As consequence, the opportunity to widen \nthe views and make more holistic and strategic decisions, \nsomething proclaimed as being the very essence of LCC in \ncontrast to regular investment calculus, might get lost. Af-\nter all, the main idea of LCC, with its life cycle approach, \nis to support strategic decision making. The dominant \ninvolvement by project and energy managers coupled \nwith the relative absence of environmental managers in \nshaping the calculations, suggest that in practice LCCs \nrepresent a relatively narrow focus and not the long-term \nFigure 1.

Gluch et al. From tool-making to tool-using – and back: rationales for adoption and use of LCC\nand comprehensive take on environmental and sustain-\nability issues as promoted in research. Instead of being \nperceived as a fine-tuned calculation instrument, LCC is \nviewed as a credibility provider and as informative mean \nto explain and/or facilitate discussions regarding long-\nterm issues within the organisation, i.e. LCC serves as a \ncommunicative instrument giving legitimacy to the reno-\nvation project. In sum, LCC calculations give practition-\ners a sense of a systematic and rational decision-making \nprocess rather than supporting the decisions with detailed \nfigures. Thereby, the choice of, for example, the discount \nrate also becomes less important.\nThe above points towards the importance for tool-\nmakers to move beyond a functionalist view on LCC \nand adopt an interpretive view that considers actions and \nsense-making of individuals in their shaping of tools in \npractice, similarly to what Rex and Baumann (2008) con-\ncluded about LCA. LCC practice in building renovation \ntakes place in a context of multiple and partly competing \ninstitutional logics – those of economics, project practice, \nenergy efficiency and sustainability (Hill, Lorenz, Dent, \n& Lützkendorf, 2013). Renovation decisions are thus ex-\nposed to long-term demands on energy efficiency, govern-\nmental and corporate sustainability directives, while being \ngoverned by short-term corporate financial goals and poli-\ncies related to profit and return on investment (Higham \net al., 2015). These two perspectives follow different log-\nics, in that they are associated with different organizing \nprinciples where each requires a different set of behaviours \nfrom those involved (Reay & Hinings, 2009). In addition, \nthere is also the logic of project management, which is \nassociated with temporality, unique one-off nature, con-\ntext dependency, and short-term cost frames. Research on \nLCC has so far neglected the multiplicity of logics that \nare inherent in LCC practice. As noted when comparing \npractitioners group A and B, the ones who included LCC \nin their project management routines were also the most \npositive to integration of strategic functions with project \nmanagement functions. This emphasise the importance of \nnot isolating LCC to individual renovation project, and \ninstead lift it to a strategic property management level.\nWe, as do Robichaud and Anantatmula (2010), point \nto a relationship between various communicative and \ncollaborative actions and integrated life-cycle thinking in \nproject practices worthy of further exploration. Among \nthese actions and as key for more conscious adoption \nof LCC in renovation projects (cf. Häkkinen & Belloni, \n2011), our study especially points out the importance of \ngiving project managers’ more opportunities to contribute \nto long-term strategic decisions and to raise their knowl-\nedge and ability to grasp the bigger picture.\nIn the literature, the limited adoption of LCC in prac-\ntice is often seen as resulting from a lack of standards, \nformal guidelines and useable software (Arditi & Messiha, \n1999; Olubodun, Kangwa, Oladapo, & Thompson, 2010; \nGoh & Sun, 2016). However, this lack of consistent rules \ndid not stop our respondents from performing LCC calcu-\nlations, as we identified an established use of LCC among \nthem. The question remains whether or not industry \nstandards for LCC is an answer, considering that renova-\ntion projects make a contextual, fragmented, and complex \napplication context for LCC, and even more so given the \ndiversity of other contexts exhibited over time (Korpi & \nAla-Risku, 2008). An alternative to industry standardiza-\ntion is for organizations to strive for more consistency \nover time as suggested by Lindholm and Soumala (2007). \nOur study confirms the importance of consistency as it \nshows a relationship between how long LCC has been \nused in a firm/organization and the proportion of pro-\njects in which LCC is used. By continuously practicing \nlong-term cost accounting and collecting cost history data, \nan organization can develop life cycle costing throughout \nthe organization into a long-term project. By persistently \nworking with LCC, learning and knowledge on sustain-\nable building might also be developed and shared across \norganizational boundaries and thus become less depend-\nent on specific individual decision-makers.\nThis study is limited to Swedish real estate organiza-\ntions. A comparative study of rationales behind LCC use \nin different countries would be of interest setting these \nresults into a global perspective. While much of previous \nresearch have aimed at developing more sophisticated \nLCC models and tools, our results show that managers’ \ninterest in these refinements seem limited. Our recom-\nmendation is that future research should look beyond tool \ndevelopment and applications. This is not to say that such \ndevelopment should be abandoned, however, it is of little \nuse unless practitioners adopt and use these applications \nas intended. Since a quantitative survey is limited in its \nability to provide in-depth understanding regarding actual \nuse of LCC we suggest complementary qualitative studies \nof real life property management practices. Further and \nin-depth studies of how decision-making and property \nmanagement strategies are aligned in relationship to tools, \nroles and responsibilities would contribute to an increased \nunderstanding of this. Thus, paying greater attention to \nthe behavioural aspects of decision making processes, to \nthe communicative dimensions within LCC practices and \nthe possible effects from this is suggested to be a fruitful \nway forward. After all, it is people that make decisions \nnot tools.\nReferences\nArditi, D., & Messiha,  H.  M. (1999). Life cycle cost analysis \n(LCCA) in municipal organizations.
