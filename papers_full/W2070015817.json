    "abstract": "Methane (CH 4 ), ethane (C 2 H 6 ), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), and acetylene (C 2 C 2 ) are important fault characteristic hydrocarbon gases dissolved in power transformer oil. Online monitoring these gaseous components and their generation rates can present the operational state of power transformer timely and effectively. Gas sensing technology is the most sticky and tricky point in online monitoring system. In this paper, pure and Pd‐doped SnO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method and characterized by X‐ray powder diffraction, field‐emission scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy, respectively. The gas sensors were fabricated by side‐heated preparation, and their gas sensing properties against CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 4 , and C 2 H 2 were measured. Pd doping increases the electric conductance of the prepared SnO 2 sensors and improves their gas sensing performances to hydrocarbon gases. In addition based on the frontier molecular orbital theory, the highest occupied molecular orbital energy and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy were calculated. Calculation results demonstrate that C 2 H 4 has the highest occupied molecular orbital energy among CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 4 , and C 2 H 2 , which promotes charge transfer in gas sensing process, and SnO 2 surfaces capture a relatively larger amount of electric charge from adsorbed C 2 H 4 .",
