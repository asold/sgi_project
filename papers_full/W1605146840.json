Global VL and CL incidences are approximately\n0.2– 0.4 million and 0.7 – 1.2 million cases occurring each\nyear, respectively [3]. Despite the increasing number of\ninfected individuals being registered in several countries\nof the Americas (New world) Europe, Asia and Africa\n(Old world), a huge number of cases are believed to be\nunder-reported [4].\nLeishmaniases are still ignored in discussions of trop-\nical disease priorities, even being estimated to cause the\nninth largest disease burden among individual infectious\ndiseases [5, 6]. Despite scientific advances, leishmaniases\nconstitute an important public health problem. Up to\nthe moment, the leishmaniases diagnosis is performed\nby an association of clinical, epidemiological and labora-\ntorial data. Particularly in relation to laboratorial methods,\nthe lack of a gold-standard for human patients or animals\nis a limitation for the disease control, because the achieve-\nment of accurate epidemiological data is associated with\nthe guidance of control measures, thus helping to increase\ntheir efficiency. Furthermore, false-negative results could\ndelay early implementation of treatment, thereby con-\ntributing for maintenance of reservoirs, and as a conse-\nquence, the preservation of parasitological cycles in\ntheir environment.\n* Correspondence: mp@cpqam.fiocruz.br\n1Department of Immunology, Aggeu Magalhães Research Center, Oswaldo\nCruz Foundation, Av.

Cell & Bioscience  (2015) 5:31 \nDOI 10.1186/s13578-015-0021-2\nRapid methods for diagnosis and species identification\nare urgently needed, along with therapies, prophylactics,\nand control measures that are effective, safe, affordable,\nand easily administered [2]. In this context, this article\nprovides an overview on classical diagnosis and current\ninformation about technological advances for the im-\nmunological and molecular leishmaniases diagnosis, their\nfeatures, applications, limitations and perspectives.\nImmunological tools for visceral and cutaneous\nleishmaniasis diagnosis\nThe immunological procedures have been employed for\nscreening and for the definitive diagnosis of diverse\nparasitological illnesses because of their easiness and\naccuracy. For leishmaniases, these methods are largely\napplied, being, in some routine protocols, the single\ndiagnostic principle, before anti- Leishmania drug pre-\nscription [7]. Nonetheless, important limitations may carry\nto incorrect diagnostic interpretation, like cross-reactions,\nespecially with phylogenetically closely related species,\nand loss of accuracy in immunosuppressed patients. The\ncombination of different techniques, like immunochroma-\ntographic test (ICT) and rapid immunoenzyme assay, or\nthe employment of different antigenic targets and the\ncombination of distinct recombinant proteins in the same\nassay are strategies that may improve the global specificity\nand sensitivity, thus bringing a higher accuracy to the\nroutine protocols [8 – 10]. The association with the mo-\nlecular biology, mainly in reference centers, has become a\ncommon approach to the differential diagnosis of leish-\nmaniases, especially when parasitology is also inconclusive\n[11, 12]. Even so, researchers around the world have been\ndeveloping new protocols and technologies to the con-\ntinuous enhancement of the immunological diagnosis,\nthus ensuring smaller risks to patients in the detection of\nleishmaniases.\nClassical immunological tools\nMontenegro skin test (MST) has been successfully used\nin the diagnosis of cutaneous forms, but is negative for\nrecent lesions, in the diffuse form, and also in immuno-\nsuppressed patients [13]. The test is commonly positive\nin endemic areas due to the occurrence of subclinical in-\nfections. Furthermore, other characteristics may hamper\nthe applicability of the method: cross-reactions; long\ntime to retest, if necessary (at least two years); false-\npositive results caused by lack of patient cooperation,\nwhich itches the application site; subjectivity of the read-\ning (especially when the diameter of the induration has\nbetween 4 and 5 mm) and so on [14]. In the diagnosis of\nCL the use of indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA)\nassociated with MST or a parasitological technique is\nrecommended to provide a differential diagnosis. The\nlimitation of IFA lies in the fact that it does not correlate\nthe levels of circulating antibodies with disease staging.\nIn addition, there is the possibility of cross reactivity\nwith other trypanosomatids and fungi [15 – 17]. IFA is\nbased on the detection of anti- leishmania antibodies by\nemploying specific antigens (promastigote form, nor-\nmally) and secondary antibodies (anti-immunoglobulin\nantibody) conjugated with a fluorescent dye [16, 17].\nThe technique is becoming less explored in routine not\nonly for CL diagnosis, but also for canine VL (CVL)\ndiagnosis mainly because of its low specificity, in contrast\nwith the high sensitivity. Incompatibility or poor reaction\nbetween the secondary and primary antibodies or the anti-\ngen are also constraints associated with this indirect im-\nmunological assay.\nThe majority of the immunological techniques for de-\ntection of anti- Leishmania antibodies has been based on\nreactions like Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\n(ELISA) [11, 18]. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA\ndepends on the antigen used [11]. In this context, several\nantigens with different molecular weights have been\nidentified for potential use in the diagnosis. Recombin-\nant Leishmania protein K39 (rK39), a very important\nand broadly employed antigen, showed 100 % specificity\nand 96 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of VL [19]. An in-\nteresting feature of this antigen is that it can be used in\npatients co-infected with HIV, in which anti-K39 anti-\nbody levels decline rapidly with the treatment success\n[11, 20, 21]. Other candidates for the diagnosis of several\nforms of leishmaniases are recombinant or purified\nmembrane glycoproteins (gp): gp63, gp70, and gp72, and\nA2 protein, all of which are specific for the genus Leish-\nmania. A2 protein is present in amastigotes, and studies\nsuggest that is particularly useful for diagnosis of canine\nVL [20, 21]. The use of recombinant or purified gp63,\ngp72 or gp70 improved the sensitivity and specificity of\nELISA. However, cross-reactions with other diseases\ncaused by trypanosomes may occur [22, 23].\nThe numerous commercial kits of rapid diagnostic\ntests (RDTs) available are largely explored nowadays in\nroutine. The easiness concerning its use and interpret-\nation, as well as the quick results have contributed to its\nbroad application, especially for screening. The high sta-\nbility in a broad range of temperature (generally 4 – 30 °C)\nfacilitates its employment in field for screening of CVL.\nRDTs are based on the detection of specific antibodies in\nserum or peripheral blood of the patient with VL. An im-\nportant RDT, known as TRALd (Rapid Antibody Test\nLeishmania donovani ) was developed using two recom-\nbinant proteins, the rK39 and K26, fixed on nitrocellulose\npaper. An initial clinical evaluation of TRALd observed\n100 % of sensitivity and 98 % of specificity [11, 21, 23, 24].\nEven when antigenic combinations are used, there is the\npossibility of cross-reactions with other trypanosomatids,\nbeing then indicated the application of a confirmatory\nde Paiva-Cavalcanti et al. Cell & Bioscience  (2015) 5:31 Page 2 of 10\nexam, normally of a distinct principle (e.g. IFA, ELISA\netc.) or distinct antigenic composition.\nNew immunological tools\nIn relation to the new immunological tools, the use of\nflow cytometry (FC) in the diagnosis of canine VL through\nthe detection of anti-fixed L. infantum antibodies has been\nincreasingly explored [25] . Researchers demonstrated an\nexcellent performance of an FC prototype in canine VL\ndiagnostic, with high specificity, sensitivity, predictive\nvalues and accuracy, even when animals were infected\nwith other pathogens (such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Ba-\nbesia canis ), and also absence of false-positive results in\nvaccinated dogs [26]. Recently it was demonstrated the\npotential of a magnetic microsphere coated with Leish-\nmania recombinant antigens associated with FC as a\nviable tool for a highly sensitive laboratorial serodiagnosis\nof both clinical and subclinical forms of canine disease\n[27]. For human form, it was shown the detection of spe-\ncific IgG antibodies against L. chagasi using FC for cure\nassessment [28].\nFC to detect anti-live L. braziliensis antibodies has\nbeen first described by Rocha et al. [29], in which they\ndemonstrated 93.6 % sensitivity in patients with active\ndisease. Researchers working with live and fixed L. brazi-\nliensis showed that FC can be a useful serological\ntechnique to detect anti- L. braziliensis IgG antibodies,\nwith the antigens displaying an 86 and 90 % sensitivity,\nrespectively [30]. A good performance using fixed L.\namazonensis promastigotes was also demonstrated [31].\nOliveira et al. [32] showed that FC had a better perform-\nance compared to IFA in the monitoring of specific post\ntherapeutic cure of CL. Therefore, FC is becoming an in-\ncreasingly useful tool in health care and research labora-\ntories, due to its accuracy and reproducibility. Although\nthere is still a substantial cost regarding the operational\nsupport in experiments involving FC, Shared Resource\nLaboratory models are enhancing the scope and quality\nof scientific research that applies the FC based method-\nologies [26, 33, 34].\nThe Table 1 summarizes the main aspects addressed\nin the immunological methods used in leishmaniases\ndiagnosis.\nMolecular tools for leishmaniases diagnosis\nThe limitations demonstrated by the conventional tech-\nniques, both parasitological and serological, have led the\nscientists to an increasing exploration of the molecular\nbiology as a complement, as well as an alternative for\nthe accurate diagnosis of leishmaniases. The practicality,\nsafety and reliability of the molecular tools, in addition\nto the wide number of applications and the promising\nresults have contributed to the continuous acceptance of\nthese methods in routine and reference laboratories\naround the world.\nThe Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique and\nits variations, like Nested-PCR (nPCR), Seminested-PCR\n(snPCR) and Quantitative Real Time PCR (qPCR) have\nbeen largely employed for the optimization of new diag-\nnostic assays, using different target regions and samples\n[35– 37]. The follow-up of the treatment aiming the\nevaluation of a drug efficacy is a common approach [38]\nproportionated by the qPCR, with its capacity to estimate\nthe parasitological burden in several specimen types [39,\nTable 1 Advantages and limitations of immunological methods used in leishmaniases diagnosis\nMethod Antigen Advantage Limitation\nMontenegro skin test Killed whole parasites Low cost and detection of T cell\nimmunity\nMay not detect cases of visceral\nleishmaniasis in some stages of\nthe disease.

Cell & Bioscience  (2015) 5:31 Page 3 of 10\n40]. Species characterization of Leishmania is also an\nimportant application of the PCR, and it has been strongly\nexplored nowadays [41, 42]. Coupled with different meth-\nodologies, including gene sequencing and Restriction\nFragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, the\nstudies have brought this kind of analysis with distinct\ngoals: species confirmation in epidemiological researches\n[43, 44], specificity assessment of new optimized assays\n[11, 45] and comparative studies [46], for example.\nOzensoy-Toz et al. [47] have used fluorescent dyes and\nthe resulting melting temperature (Tm) interpretation as\ncriterion for Leishmania species differentiation, to both\nCL and VL etiological agents, with success. The author, as\nothers [43, 48], also performed phylogenetic analysis of\nspecies from isolates by gene amplification and sequen-\ncing. According to Grimaldi and Tesh [49], the correct\nidentification of the causative Leishmania species is dir-\nectly related to decision upon the appropriate treatment\nregimens and to design effective control programs.\nVisceral leishmaniasis diagnosis\nBetween 2011 and 2013, conventional PCR protocols for\nVL presented a sensitivity variation from 53.7 to 97.78 %\nfor humans and from 72.2 to 98.7 % for dogs, and the\nspecificity varied from 61.82 to 100 % for humans and\nfrom 83.3 to 96.4 % for dogs [41, 43, 50, 51]. The high\nvariability also occurs to qPCR for humans, with a speci-\nficity variation from 29.6 to 100 %. The range of sensitiv-\nity (91.3 – 100 %) [41, 51] presented short and with high\nvalues, thus demonstrating the applicability of the qPCR\nat situations in which a sensitive tool is pivotal, like dis-\nease monitoring to predict relapse. Results obtained by\nSolcà et al. [52] show the PCR as being more sensitive\nthan qPCR in dog samples. This reinforces that some\ncharacteristics like the DNA target region, as well as the\npair of primers used may be determinant.\nAs occurs in different clinical statuses, the parasitic\nburden in the various samples differs. Getting advantage\non the specimen type, Pandey et al. [53] and Silva et al.\n[54] standardized PCR reactions (snPCR and qPCR,\nrespectively) to detect the parasite DNA from Giemsa-\nstained smears, prepared from bone marrow aspirates.\nThe first author ’s assay detected L. donovani DNA in\n68.7 % of the human samples. The second author de-\ntected L. chagasi DNA in 100 % of the canine samples.\nBoth assays presented superiority in relation to micros-\ncopy and culture. Other alternative samples, like urine\nand conjunctival swabs are being largely explored for\nhumans [55, 56] and dogs [39, 57 – 60] with good accur-\nacy. Although the small parasite DNA amount, they do\nnot request invasive procedures for obtaining, thus\nbringing security and comfort to the patient [36, 57].\nDespite these advantages, several Taq Polymerase in-\nhibitors are found in these clinical specimens or they are\ncommonly used for sample collection and DNA extrac-\ntion, like EDTA, Proteinase K, Phenol and high salts\nconcentrations [61, 62]. Recently, some authors have\nbrought the strategy of the multiplex PCR to include en-\ndogenous controls altogether with the detection system\nof Leishmania sp., in the same reaction, for PCR [61]\nand qPCR [63] assays. Mohammadiha et al. [41] per-\nformed this multiplex format for humans and dogs,\nusing TaqMan-based qPCR, having reached a very good\nsensitivity in both cases (93.9 – 100 %, respectively). Gon-\nçalves-de-Albuquerque et al. [64] standardized a triplex\nPCR to CL capable to monitor not only the sample qual-\nity, but also small losses of DNA during the extraction\nprocess by using a plasmid as reporter.\nInnovative molecular approaches, as the Nucleic Acid\nSequence-Based Assay (NASBA), the Loop-Mediated Iso-\nthermal Amplification (LAMP), and the low-tech Oligo-\nTesT have been increasingly applied for Leishmania DNA\nor RNA detection. The NASBA have its variations, the\nquantitative (QT-NASBA) and coupled to oligochromato-\ngraphy (NASBA-OC) [65 – 69]. Vries et al. [65] have used\nQT-NASBA for the evaluation of the efficacy of a drug for\nVL treatment, by estimating the quantification of L. infan-\ntum parasites in blood. Basiye et al. [66] and Mugasa et al.\n[67] have applied NASBA-OC to diagnostic assays devel-\nopment, based on L. donovani RNA detection, reaching\nsensitivity of 79.80 – 93.30 % (respectively) and specificity\nof 100 % (both). The NASBA-OC uses a sensitized mem-\nbrane of an oligochromatographic dipstick to detect the\namplified RNA, in 5 – 10 min just with a pipette and a\nwater bath, but without quantification capacity [68]. QT-\nNASBA has the inconvenience of the electrochemilumi-\nnescence as tool of detection, which involves more\nhandling steps and procedure time than qPCR and Re-\nverse transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR) [69].\nThe LAMP , a promising diagnostic tool, has been\nadopted as an alternative technique to PCR, since it is a\nfaster, sensitive and less expensive technology, which\nuses the turbidity of the sample as criteria of positivity.\nThere is no need of a thermal cycler, just a water bath or\na heat block, since the reaction is isothermal. Therefore,\nthis is a tool suitable for field application [70, 71]. Verma\net al. [72] developed a LAMP-based assay for L. dono-\nvani detection in humans with VL and Post-Kala-azar\nDermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) in which the sensitivity\nand specificity rates were good to both cases, achieving\n96.4– 98.5 % (in VL blood samples); 96.8 – 98.5 % (in tis-\nsue biopsy samples). Nevertheless, Chaouch et al. [73]\ndeveloped a LAMP amplification for L. infantum detec-\ntion in dogs, and the sensitivity reached was low (54.2 %),\nthough having performed better than IF and PCR, statisti-\ncally. The chosen target (cysteine Protease B gene - cpb)\nand the non-use of an internal quality control can in part\nexplain this result.\nde Paiva-Cavalcanti et al. Cell & Bioscience  (2015) 5:31 Page 4 of 10\nCutaneous leishmaniasis diagnosis\nAs presented for VL, molecular techniques are advan-\ncing in studies for increasing their sensibility and specifi-\ncity. They have been increasingly recommended for CL\ndiagnosis due to their accuracy and speed [74], when\ncompared to conventional diagnostic methods [47, 74].\nMohaghegh et al. [75] used PCR for confirming negative\ndirect stained smear, confirming the higher sensitivity of\nthe molecular method in comparison with classical diag-\nnosis (direct stained smear). As for VL, different biological\nsamples can be used with the molecular technology: blood\n[76], smear [75], scarification of the edge lesion [77] and\nbiopsy skin [78, 79].\nSeveral authors have used the qPCR technology to de-\ntect the DNA from the etiological agents in varied sam-\nples from animals and human patients, allowing studies\nrelated to parasite load, host-parasite interaction, monitor-\ning of therapy and post-treatment response in infected hu-\nman patients [80, 81]. Another common approach to CL\nis the application for differentiation of Leishmania species\n[47, 81 – 83]. Authors using dyes or fluorescent probes\nhave had great results. Paiva-Cavalcanti et al. [82] used\nskin samples from humans and blood samples from\ndomestic animals; Ozensoy Toz et al. [47] used skin aspir-\nation fluid, smear, and biopsy from human patients;\nPita-Pereira et al. [83] used skin biopsy samples from\npatients living in areas with well-known occurrences of\nCL. They have differentiated Viannia and Leishmania\nsubgenera through Tm. Nonetheless, the qPCR requires\na laboratory with the technical capacity to perform it;\nthus, this technology is becoming available at Central\nDiagnostic Laboratories, in countries where leishmania-\nses are endemic [81].\nThe nPCR is commonly used for some researchers\n[78]. Shirian et al. [84] performed the technique by using\nscraped off of slides with impression smears from 20\nsuspect cases of ML, getting 18 positive samples (90 %).\nOnly eight were positive through direct microscopy\n(44.4 %). The PCR based method was not only a useful\nand more precise diagnostic approach in the identifica-\ntion of ML cases with negative cytology, but also showed\nto be efficient in determining the species of the parasites.\nAzzi et al. [74] concluded that nPCR is a useful technique\nfor studying the molecular epidemiology in the field.\nThe QT-NASBA assay is a useful instrument to moni-\ntor parasite load in skin biopsies of patients with CL\nafter treatment and can help to predict clinical outcome\n[69]. qPCR, RT-qPCR and QT-NASBA were compared\nby Van der Meide et al. [69], and they concluded that\nRT-qPCR and QT-NASBA are the most sensitive assays,\ngenerating reproducible results. However, as described\nbefore, QT-NASBA is less convenient since the electro-\nchemiluminescence detection involves more handling\nsteps and procedure time.\nDespite the variety of molecular tools (Pulsed Field\nGel Electrophoresis – PFGE, the Multilocus Enzyme\nElectrophoresis – MEE, and more), PCR still represents\none of the major advances on diagnosis and research of\nthe leishmaniases [85], even presenting its deficiencies,\nwhich have been minimized due to the continuous effort\nof researchers, attempting to bring more viability to its\napplication in health service.\nTable 2 summarizes the main aspects addressed in the\nmolecular methods used in leishmaniases diagnosis.\nTable 3 gathers the clinical sensitivities and specific-\nities of the immunological and molecular methods com-\nmented throughout the text.\nMolecular targets\nSeveral different genomic targets are used for Leish-\nmania sp. detection as rDNA (ITS-1 and SSU rDNA),\nkinetoplastid minicircle DNA (kDNA), splice leader mini-\nexon (SMLE), tryparedoxin peroxidase gene and, heat-\nshock protein 70 gene (HSP70) [47, 77, 79, 82, 86 – 89].\nThis is one of the challenges to be surpassed for a future\nimplementation of a gold-standard molecular method-\nology for CL and VL. Nevertheless, the choice of each\ntarget is related to the different applicability, i.e., with\nthe objectives of each study, such as the case of HSP70\nused by authors for species typing [45, 89, 90], while the\nkDNA is the main target used for diagnostic screening\n[79, 91 – 93].\nThe kDNA is largely elected for DNA amplification of\nL. donovani complex, because of the high number of\ncopies (10,000) per parasite [94]. This target has been\nchosen for several applications, like for epidemiological\nstudies in canine populations, took place in countries like\nBrazil and China [43, 95, 96], for species characterization\n[43, 97], for treatment follow-up and for assays develop-\nment, with great results [72, 98].\nRocha et al. [99] compared different PCR protocols for\nLeishmania subgenus species detection, based on kDNA\nminicircle or mini-exon amplification. Concerning the\nkDNA minicircle, as long as the PCR protocol for L. ama-\nzonensis pointed out no specificity, since L. infantum was\nalso detected, the PCR assay for L. infantum did not amp-\nlify DNA of any Viannia spp. or L. amazonensis , showing\nthus the importance also in selecting a specific and repre-\nsentative region of the target DNA, for primers design or\nselection from other authors. The mini-exon protocol pre-\nsented inability to recognize any Leishmania subgenus\nspecies. Intraspecific variations of the utilized strains were\nconsidered to explain it. Roelfsema et al. [42] have com-\npared the mini-exon and the Internal Transcribed Spacer-\n1 (ITS-1) rDNA in molecular typing of clinical samples.\nThe mini-exon has performed better for typing species\nbelonging to L. Viannia subgenus by sequencing, whereas\nde Paiva-Cavalcanti et al. Cell & Bioscience  (2015) 5:31 Page 5 of 10\nITS-1 PCR has differentiated L. infantum and L. donovani\nafter a Hae III RFLP analysis.\nAs kDNA, the ribosomal RNA small subunit gene\n(SSU rRNA), as well as the ITS-1 region have been ex-\nplored for many objectives, including epidemiological re-\nsearches in human and canine populations [40, 97, 100],\nassays optimization [35, 47, 70] and for studies involving\nHIV/VL co-infected patients, a situation in which the\nserological diagnosis of VL is limited, and the molecular\ndiagnosis is highlighted [101, 102]. A qPCR system for\nCL created by Paiva-Cavalcanti et al. [82] using kDNA\nas target has applicability in population studies, etiological\ndiagnosis and the monitoring of treatment efficacy of indi-\nvidual patients. The same work demonstrated the high\nconcordance between kDNA and SSU rDNA, concluding\nthat both may be used for American CL diagnosis;\nTable 2 Advantages and limitations of molecular methods used in leishmaniases diagnosis\nMethod Advantage Limitation\nConventional PCR (cPCR) High sensitivity, specificity and accurate results.\nMany applications in molecular analysis.

Cell & Bioscience  (2015) 5:31 Page 6 of 10\naltogether, the results indicate the best performance of the\nkDNA protocol. Summarizing, the kDNA target may be\nused for diagnosis due to its sensitivity [78, 79, 87, 103 –\n105], whereas ITS-1 is more specific and may be used for\nspecies identification [78].\nRegarding the advances in molecular biology, the choice\nof the target region to be imaged is the key point for the\nsuccessful use of diagnostic PCR-based technologies.\nProposal of gold-standard diagnostic strategies\nfor leishmnaniases detection in humans\nTechnological advances have contributed to raise new\ndiagnostic guidelines not only in the parasitological field,\nbut also in all areas regarding pathology. The technology\nhas brought new analytical possibilities, with increasingly\nspeed, accuracy and reliability. In microbiology, robotic-\nbased equipments are helping to provide molecular as-\nsessments with safety and precision in both diagnostic\nroutine and research. Regarding the leishmaniases, the ad-\nvent of real-time PCR thermocyclers and flow-cytometric\nanalysis (mainly) has contributed to the development of\nsensitive and specific approaches which have especially\ncontributed to solve inconclusive cases, thus enabling im-\nplementation of early and adequate treatment. The estab-\nlishment of a gold-standard immunological or molecular\ndiagnosis is still a challenge, mainly because of a lack of\nstandardization among laboratories and also structural/\neconomic concerns. In fact, the complexity of leishmania-\nses also acts as an important barrier to be surpassed.\nTherefore, we propose a combination of different tech-\nniques for maximizing sensitivity and specificity, for a safe\nand reliable diagnosis: for CL, when MST is positive and\nparasitological analysis is negative (or is not performed),\nqPCR and/or FC could be employed as complementary\ninvestigation. For VL, when clinical evaluation is indicative\n(after differential diagnoses) and screening serological\ntests show negative results, qPCR could be employed as\nan alternative exam performed in reference centers, thus\navoiding the painful and invasive bone marrow biopsy, es-\npecially for children. For immunosuppressed individuals\nsuch as HIV/VL co-infected patients, the monitoring of\nparasite load through qPCR is fundamental to predict re-\nlapses as well as treatment failures.\nConclusions\nImmunological tools are options in leishmaniases diag-\nnosis, highlighting the growth of FC as a more specific\nand sensitive alternative to overcome the limitations of\nthese techniques and even as a method to assess clinical\ncure. Likewise, molecular diagnosis has become a poten-\ntial strategy to provide the early detection and conse-\nquently the fast treatment implementation, as well as for\nspecies characterization, assessment of treatment effi-\ncacy and monitoring of relapses. The easiness, safety and\nhigh accuracy have made the molecular biology increas-\ningly interesting as complement or as alternative for\ndefining the definitive VL and CL diagnosis. The techno-\nlogical advance in this case has becoming an adjuvant to\nprevent the continuous spread of the disease and its so-\ncial consequences, mainly at poor populations.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors certify that there are no competing interests with any financial\norganization regarding the material discussed in the manuscript.\nAuthors’ contributions\nMPC and VRAP contributed equally to the intellectual construction, writing\nand editing of the article.
