Introduction \n \nRecently, over-dependency on the fossil fuels has \ncreated pollution, environmenta l damage, and, eventually, \nresource depletion problems. In addition, global warming \nis becoming a larger concern, and the electricity energy \nshortage problem can cause blackouts [1-3]. To address \nthese problems, the demand fo r green energy continues to \nincrease. Since green energy does not negatively influence \nthe environment and uses renewable power sources, its \napplication has become a significant research topic. Further, \nthe smart-grid, micro/nano-grids and DC distribution \nsystems are also critical issues in today’s world market. \nIn particular, the solid state transformer (SST) has been \nactively studied, which is one of the key technologies for \nthe smart-grid, micro / nano-grid, and DC distribution \nsystems. As shown in Fig. 1, the SST is a bi-directional \npower conversion component that is used to interface a \nconventional AC grid with an AC/DC microgrid. Besides, \nthe SST can be an alternative to substitute the old-\nfashioned line-frequency (50 Hz/60 Hz) transformer [1, 4-5]. \nThe weight and volume of the conventional transformers \nare heavy and bulky. Moreover, it is also a totally passive, \ncausing reactive power. For thes e reasons, the applications \nof traditional transformers are very restrictive [6-8]. The \nSST can solve the problems of the line-frequency \ntransformer by using a high frequency transformer with \nreactive power control. Furthermore, the SST has other \nadvantages such as instan taneous voltage regulation, \npower factor correction, higher power density and systems \nprotection capability. Fig. 2 shows that the SST consists \nof three parts: a bi-directional AC-DC rectifier, an \nisolated bi-directional DC-DC converter (IBDC), and a bi-\ndirectional DC-AC inverter. \n†  Corresponding Author: School of Electrical and Computer \nEngineering, Ulsan National Ins titute of Science and Technology \n(UNIST), Korea.

As one of based on isolated bi-directional \nbridge type topologies , the dual active bridge (DAB) \nconverter has advantages, such as wide output voltage \nranges and high efficiency. Particularly, based on a phase-\nshift modulation (PSM), the DAB converter can smoothly \ncontrol the bi-directional power flows under a seamless \nvoltage regulation manner. In addition, the DAB topology \ncan reduce the switching losses by the inherent zero \nvoltage switching (ZVS) capability. However, the DAB \nconverter has disadvantage, such as high switching losses \ndue to ZVS inadequacy at light load conditions and high \nconduction losses caused by hi gh circulating current under \nheavy load conditions.  \nIn this paper, to improve the performance of the DAB \nconverter, a well-organized design methodology will be \nproposed. In Section II, operation principles of the DAB \nconverter will be introduced briefly. In addition, practical \ndesign considerations of proper coupling inductance will \nbe proposed to improve overall efficiency using RMS \ncurrent analysis. To guarantee the maximum ZVS capability, \neffective dead time criterion will be determined based on a \nmathematical model. In Section III, a soft start algorithm \nwill be proposed to suppress overcurrent stress of the power \nswitches during the start-up sequence. Finally, in Section \nIV , the proposed DAB converter design methodology will \nbe verified by experimental data using a 3.3 kW prototype \nconverter. \n \n \n2. Design Methodology \n \nFig. 3 shows the schematic of the DAB converter. The \nDAB converter need to eliminate this parts, which is \nunnecessary consists of two single-phase symmetrical H-\nbridges with a coupling inductor. For the SST applications, a \nhigh frequency transformer with 1:1 turn-ratio is applied \nin the converter. For a simplic ity in the converter analysis, \nthe magnetizing current is ignored by assuming a perfect \ntransformer. \n \n2.1 Operation principles of the DAB converter \n \nThe operational principle of the DAB converter is \nsimple and similar to the case of the phase-shift full bridge \nconverter. As shown in Fig. 4, the DAB converter can \nachieve the ZVS when switches are turning on with \nsufficient negative primary current [9-11]. The steady state \noperation of the DAB converter is divided into two modes: \nforward and backward according  to the current directions. \nPower is transferred from the leading bridge to the lagging \nbridge, and the two square waves are properly phase \nshifted to control the power flows. Output voltage can be \nregulated from the difference between the two H-bridge \nvoltages, which is applied over the coupling inductance \n(L\nS) in the Fig. 3. The coupling inductance which is sum of \nthe leakage inductance in the transformer and the external \ninductance acts as an energy transfer device [10-14]. \n \n2.2 Coupling inductance current analysis \n \nSince the coupling inductance is a dominant parameter \nas the energy transfer component in the DAB converter, \nthe analysis of the coupling inductor current becomes \nimportant in the operational principle of the DAB \nconverter [10-12, 15]. Fig. 5 indicates the detail waveforms \nof the coupling inductor current, i\nLs, in Fig. 4. From Fig. 5, \neach corner current i1 and i2 are derived as follows in (1) \nand (2): \n \nFig. 4.

By using the corn er values of the coupling \ninductor current, as shown in  Fig. 5, the average input \ncurrent, Iin,a, and the average output current referred to the \ntransformer primary side, Io,a, can be derived as (3) and (4), \nrespectively [12]. \n \n,1 2 1 2\n2\n21 1 1 2() () ( ) ( 1 ) 222\nS\nin a in a b\nT SS\nIt i t d t i t i t i i d TT\n⎡⎤== − + + + −⎢⎥\n⎣⎦∫  \n              \n(1 )\n2\nOS\nS\nVd dT\nnL\n−= (3) \no, 1 2 1 2\n2\n21 1 1 2() () ( ) ( 1 ) 222\nS\nao a b\nT SS\nIt n i t d t i t i t i i d TT\n⎡⎤== − + + − ⎢⎥\n⎣⎦∫  \n \n(1 )\n2\nin S\nS\nVd dT\nnL\n−=   (4) \n \nTheoretically, from (3) and (4), the maximum output \npower of the DAB converter can be obtained at 50% phase-\nshift between the two H-bridges; however, proper dead \ntime should be considered for the ZVS conditions of the \npower switches and preventing the shoot-through faults. \nFrom (1) to (4), the optimal value of the coupling \ninductance, L\nS, and the proper value of the dead time \nduration, td, can be derived. \n \n2.3 Proper design of coupling inductance  \n \nThe output power should be considered to design the \nproper coupling inductance.

It shows that sm aller coupling inductance can \ntransfer the higher power in the DAB converter. However, \nthe smaller coupling inductance also can induce the higher \nconduction losses due to the higher RMS current expressed \nas shown in (9). \n \n2\n4( 2 )\n8\nSo i n o\nRMS in\no\nSi n\nTv v v d dIv v nnLv n\n⎡ ⎤−⎛⎞=− + ⎢ ⎥⎜⎟⎛⎞ ⎝⎠⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦−⎜⎟⎝⎠\n  (9) \nPractical Design of Dual Active Bridge Converter as Isolated Bi-directional Power Interface for Solid State Transformer Applications \n 1268 │ J Electr Eng Technol.2016; 11(5): 1265-1273 \nFig. 7 shows RMS current variation according to the \ncoupling inductance and the amount of the phase-shift. The \nRMS current is inversely proportional to the coupling \ninductance. Therefore, consid ering (8) and (9), a proper \ncoupling inductance value should be determined. \n \n2.4 Dead time duration for soft switching \n \nOne of design difficulties of the DAB converter is low \nefficiency under light load conditions caused by limited \nZVS capability. This induces ha rd switching of the power \nswitches, which reduces the overall power conversion \nefficiency. To ensure the maximum ZVS region, sufficient \ntime for charge and discharge process of the power \nMOSFETs’ output capacitance should be guaranteed, which \nrequires an optimal dead time duration. In previous research, \ntraditional dead time duration has already been derived \nas a necessary condition; however, they did not consider \ncharging and discharging speed of the output capacitance \n[13-15]. \nSince the dead time should be longer than the charging \nand discharging duration of the MOSFETs’ output \ncapacitance, the dead time condition can be derived as \nfollows [16]: \n \n \n()12n,4m ip max c d dCv i t i i t≤≅  (10) \n \nwhere vmax is the maximum voltage applied to the switches, \nCp is the output capacitance, ic is the current passing \nthrough the output capacitors, and i1 and i2 are the corner \nvalues of the coupling inductor current in Fig. 5. It is \nassumed that ic is constant during the dead time duration \nwhich is short enough. Consequently, the ZVS of the \npower MOSFETs can be guarant eed by the accurate dead \ntime duration described as follows: \n \n ()\n16 11\nS\ndp S\nmax\nftC L Md≥ − +  (11) \n \nwhere fs is the switching frequency. \n \n \n3. Soft Start Algorithm \n \nA conventional control method of the DAB converter \nuses the fixed duty ratio with the consideration of dead \ntime which is applied to each power switch. The phase of \nthe pulse width modulated (PWM) signal is shifted \nbetween the primary and secondary sides to regulate the \noutput voltage. This control manner is so-called the PSM \n[10-11, 14]. However, this output voltage control strategy \nis limited to only the steady-state operation of the converter. \nDuring a cold start sequence , the PSM directly transfers \nelectric power from the primary side to the output \ncapacitors. It causes inrush cu rrent due to rapidly charging \nthe output capacitor regardless of the phase-shift condition \nin the DAB converter. It can be one of the reasons why the \ninrush current induces stress  and heat, causing the power \nswitches to breakdown in the DAB converter. Fig. 8 shows \nthe simulation results using the PSIM software. It shows \noutput voltage and input current waveforms at the cold-\nstart state with only normal feedback control. When the \noutput voltage rises quickly, the high inrush current \nfugitively flows through the switches. To reduce the stress \nfrom the inrush current, a soft start algorithm is required. \n \n3.1 Concepts of soft start algorithm \n \nTo address the problems of the high inrush current \nduring cold-start state, a soft  start algorithm is proposed. \nAs shown in Fig. 9, the algorithm is divided into the three \nsequence in terms of output voltage levels: an open loop \nduty control (OPDC), an open loop phase-shift control \n(OLPSC), and a closed loop phase-shift control (CLPSC). \nAccording to the output voltage level, proper control \nalgorithms are selected to suppress the inrush current under \nthe cold start sequence. \n \n3.2 Open loop phase control \n \nAt the initial state, the OLDC is applied to the DAB \n \nFig. 8. Simulated inrush current of the DAB converter a t \nthe cold start duration \n \nFig. 9. The control diagram of the proposed three sequences\nsoft start algorithm \nHyun-Jun Choi and Jee-Hoon Jung \n http://www.jeet.or.kr │1269\nconverter. Fig. 10 shows the process of the OLDC. At the \nbeginning state, the duty ratio is not fixed as 0.5 but \nlinearly increased from zero to 0.5. This control is the same \nas the full-bridge converter PWM control manner, used to \nregulate the output voltage. The OLDC makes input \ncurrent increase softly and re duces the peak value of the \ninrush current. Using the OL DC in the ideal case, the \noutput voltage can effectively reach the reference voltage. \nHowever, due to parasitics, the target output voltage may \nnot be reached. Therefore, to obtain the expected output \nvoltage, the control mechanism should be improved. \nThe most suitable method is feedback control to regulate \nthe output voltage to the reference. However, if the \nfeedback control is achieved immediately after the OLDC, \nit can also cause high primary currents. This is because the \nphase of the gate signal, as a result of the OLDC, will be \nshifted in an instant. To prevent fast variations of the phase \ngap between the primary and secondary legs, the OLPSC is \nproposed. As shown in Fig. 11, the OLPSC algorithm \nmakes the linear increase of the phase gap degree \nproportional to time duration. The OLPSC leads to reach \nthe output voltage to the reference smoothly, and decreases \npeak inrush current simultaneously. \n \n3.3 Closed loop phase control  \n \nAfter the overall open loop  soft start controls are \nfinished, the feedback controller starts to regulate the exact \noutput voltage. The CLPSC is the normal feedback control \nalgorithm of the DAB converter, which uses the difference \nbetween output and reference voltage. The key of the \nCLPSC in the proposed soft start algorithm is when the \nfeedback controller starts in steady state operation. Fig. 12 \nshows the comparison of two CLPSC starting point cases.  \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFig. 12. Comparison of feedback control starting points: \n(a) After open loop control; (b) Before open loop \ncontrol \n \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFig. 13. Comparison of cold start waveforms: (a) Without \nthe soft start algorithm; (b) With the soft start \nalgorithm \n \nFig. 12 (a) indicates the waveform when the feedback \ncontrol begins immediately after the overall open loop \ncontrols are ended. Fig. 12 (b) presents that the feedback \ncontrol starts when the output voltage comes to 80% of the \nexpected reference voltage. In case of Fig. 12 (b), the \nfeedback controller accumulates and updates the errors \nbefore finishing the OLPSC. Although the latter has higher \ncomplexity and computational burden than the case of the \n \nFig. 10. Operational principle of the proposed open loop \nduty (OLD) algorithm \n \n \nFig. 11.

Even though the settling time \nis extended, the RMS inrush current decreases from 14.45 \nA to 8.39 A when the soft start algorithm is implemented. \nIn other words, the proposed soft start algorithm makes \nalmost 41 % reduction of RMS current. Also, the peak \nvalue of the inrush current de creases almost 8 A during the \ncold start. \n \nTable 1.

Particularly, the coupling \ninductance is selected as 102 μH based on the power rating \nand RMS current, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Fig. 14 \nshows the bi-directional power flows test condition. The \nresistor in front of the DAB converter is required to \nsuppress the input current ripple. Another resistor which is \nconnected to the output stag e of the DAB converter is \nrequired to make a current source from a uni-directional \npower supply.

The same PCB boards are applied on each \ntransformer side due to the symmetric configuration. To get \nrobustness against noise and disturbance, the high voltage \nceramic capacitors are connected both high and low side \nlegs\n. To suppress noise and stray inductance, the gate \ndrives are located very close to the power switches.  \nFig. 16 and 17 indicate the bi-directional power flows \nexperimental results in forward and backward conditions, \nrespectively. Each result is measured according to load \nvariations from 500 W to 3.3 kW. The input voltage is \nfixed to 380 V , and the target output voltage is regulated \nto 380 V . As shown in Fig. 16 and 17, phase gap between \nthe primary and secondary legs signify the amount of \ntransferred power. At the 3.3 kW condition in the forward \npower flow, th,e output voltage ripple is only about 2.5% \nof reference. Fig. 18 shows the bi-directional step load \nresponse from the forward direction of 3.3 kW to the \nbackward direction of -3.3 kW. Although the dynamic \nstep load variation is 6.6 kW with changing power flow \ndirections, the output voltage is regulated well. \nFig. 19 indicates the efficien cy curves of the prototype \nDAB converter according to the load variation from 500 W \nto 3.3 kW. At the 1.5 kW condition, the highest efficiency \nis measured as 96.62% and 96.54% with forward and \nbackward power flow, respectivel y. In addition, at the full \nload conditions with forward and backward power flows, \nthe power conversion efficien cy is measured as 94.35% \nand 95.10%, respectively. At light load conditions, the \nefficiency is lower than the heavy load cases since the \nconduction loss due to the circulating current passing \nthrough the MOSFET, transfor mer and inductor is more \nsignificant. At the full load conditions, the power \nconversion efficiency also decreases since the conduction \nloss is increased by higher load current. \n \n \n5.
