This paper aims at improving the performance and accuracy of electronic\ninstrument transformers that are replacing the conventional current and potential transformers in the future\ndigital substations. One of the main issues associated with the electronic instrument transformer is its poor\nthermal stability that affects the accuracy of the measurements. In this paper, to overcome this issue, a new\nwireless temperature measurement and compensation technique is proposed.

INTRODUCTION\nElectronic instrument transformer has been given much atten-\ntion during the last few years as a cost-effective asset to\nreplace the classic magnetic core-based instrument trans-\nformers due to its several advantages that include wide band\nwidth and large dynamic range [1]–[4]. However, due to the\ndiverse sensing principles within the electronic instrument\ntransformer, it is reported to be of poor thermal stability\nthat affects its measurement accuracy [5]–[9]. Unlike the\ntraditional electromagnetic transformer that exhibits better\ntemperature performance and generally does not require tem-\nperature compensation, the electronic instrument transformer\nmust employ an effective temperature compensation tech-\nnique. The research on temperature compensation is mainly\nfocusing on the optical-based electronic transformer which\nhas a single measurement function [10]–[12].

Therefore, it is\nnecessary to develop a cost-effective technique to monitor\nthe temperature of an operating electronic combined instru-\nment transformer and compensate the temperature effect in\nreal-time to improve its overall thermal stability and enhance\nthe measurement accuracy. A few studies can be found in\nthe literatures on the temperature compensation of electronic\ntransformers [16]–[19] in which the proposed temperature\nmeasurement techniques include infrared [20], [21], ﬁber\nBragg grating [22]–[25] and wireless measurement [26], [27].\nThe infrared thermometry is susceptible to the complex inter-\nnal structure of the electronic instrument transformer and\nhas a low accuracy measurement. On the other hand, while\nthe insulation of the ﬁber Bragg grating can be realized,\nthe ﬁber can be easily broken and its surface is prone to\n97614 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The wireless temperature measurement method is\neasy to realize in electronic instrument transformer; however,\nthe power supply at the high voltage side is a challenge and\nthe interference with the surrounding electromagnetic ﬁeld\nalong with the adverse effect of operating temperature reduce\nthe accuracy of measurements. References [28]–[30] present\nthe application of wireless temperature measurement alarm\nsystem in medical and greenhouse temperature management.\nOnce the temperature of the equipment is abnormal, the sys-\ntem can be automatically alarmed remotely to eliminate\naccidents in real time. For the temperature compensation of\nelectronic transformers, there are relatively few related stud-\nies. References [31]–[33] present temperature compensation\ntechniques for a closed-loop all ﬁber current transformer and\nﬁber Bragg grating AC current transformer, which improve\nthe test accuracy of the system in the full temperature range.\nHowever, these temperature compensation techniques mainly\nfocus on sensor temperature performance analysis without\ngiving much attention to the temperature measurement tech-\nnology itself. This paper focuses on the key technologies and\ncompensation techniques in wireless temperature measure-\nment system.\nIn view of the deﬁciency of the main temperature measure-\nment methods presented above, a new wireless temperature\nmeasurement system is proposed in this paper for a designed\nelectronic combined instrument transformer. The temperature\nmeasuring system comprises a transmission module mounted\nat the high voltage side of the instrument transformer, a\nreceiving module that is placed at the low voltage side and\na monitoring software dashboard in the upper computer.\nIn order to eliminate the interference with the surrounding\nelectromagnetic ﬁeld, an anti-interference method is devel-\noped for both hardware and software, which guarantees the\naccuracy of the temperature data that are compensated to\nimprove the measurement accuracy of the electronic instru-\nment transformer. The proposed temperature measurement\nsystem can be employed in a wide range of applications\nincluding power system protection, control and condition\nmonitoring of the critical assets within the transmission and\ndistribution networks.\nII. BASIC STRUCTURE OF ELECTRONIC TRANSFORMER\nThe basic structure of the electronic combined instrument\ntransformer shown in Fig.1 comprises a Rogowski coil sensor\nto realize current measurement and a coaxial capacitor sensor\nfor voltage measurement. The current and voltage sensors\nare used for measurement and protection at the same time.\nThese sensors exhibit high thermal stress due to the large\ncurrent passing through the main conductor. Furthermore, the\ndynamic change in the environmental temperature will have\nadverse effects on the measurement accuracy of these sensors.\nTherefore, to maintain high measurement accuracy for the\ncurrent and voltage sensors, it is necessary to monitor the\ninternal operating temperature of the electronic instrument\nFIGURE 1. Basic structure of electronic combined instrument transformer.\ntransformer to compensate its adverse impact on the mea-\nsurement accuracy of the sensor. The operating temperature\nof electronic transformers is usually within the range −40◦C\nto +50◦C. Within this temperature range, the measurement\nerror of the electronic transformer should not exceed ±0.2%.\nIII. DESIGN OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM\nThe proposed temperature measuring system is shown\nin Fig. 2. The system consists of a transmission module,\na receiving module and a monitoring software in the upper\ncomputer. The transmission module is installed at the high\nvoltage side of the transformer as shown in Fig. 1 and is\nused to measure the surrounding temperature of the sensors\nand transmit the measured data to the receiving module via\na wireless transmission. The current and voltage measure-\nments of the Rogowski coil and the coaxial capacitor are\nalso collected by the transmission module and transmitted\nto the receiving module. Optical ﬁber is used to connect\nthe receiving module and the merging unit of the electronic\ninstrument transformer while output data from the merging\nunit are transmitted to the upper computer through a network\ncable using IEC 61850-9-2 communication protocol. The\ntransmission module side comprises a special power supply\ncoil circuit, a temperature sensor, a single chip microcom-\nputer (SCM) control circuit and a wireless transmitter.\nOn the other hand, the receiving module that is mounted\nat the pedestal consists of a SCM control circuit and a wire-\nless receiver. The detailed designs of these components are\nelaborated below.\nA. DESIGN OF THE TRANSMISSION MODULE\nThe transmission module consists of temperature sensor,\npower processing and energy storage (lithium battery), SCM\nand wireless transceiver circuit, as shown in the schematic\ndiagram of Fig.3.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 97615\nZ. Liet al.: New Online Temperature Compensation Technique for Electronic Instrument Transformers\nFIGURE 2. Main structure of the proposed wireless temperature measurement system.\nFIGURE 3. Main components of the transmission module at the high voltage side.\nFIGURE 4. Schematic diagram of the power supply coil circuit.\nA digital temperature sensor DS18B20 with a range of\n−55◦C to +125◦C is used for temperature measurement.\nThe electronic components in the transmission module are\nenergized using a special power supply coil of 3.3V output\nvoltage and an energy storage circuit. According to the design\nrequirements, the current variation range of the transformer is\n50A to 1.25kA. As the power supply should be functioning\noutside this range, the energy storage circuit supplies the\nrequired power when the current is less than 50A while the\npower supply coil is functioning when the current is larger\nthan 50A to provide the required power and charge the lithium\nbattery at the same time. Using saturation characteristic of\nthe power supply coil, the power supply circuit can convert\nthe current signal within the designated range into a voltage\nsignal of about 3.3V . The operating principle diagram of the\npower supply coil circuit is shown in Fig.4.\nIn Fig. 4, the output of the power supply coil is transmitted\nto a full wave rectiﬁcation circuit that converts the input\nsignal into DC voltage. The level of the output DC voltage\nis regulated to 3.3V using LC ﬁltering along with DC-DC\nconversion circuits. As the rectiﬁed voltage increases with\nthe increase in the primary current, a protection circuit as\nshown in Fig.5 is also used to protect the subsequent DC-DC\nconversion circuit. In Fig.5, if the voltage across the diode\n97616 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Liet al.: New Online Temperature Compensation Technique for Electronic Instrument Transformers\nFIGURE 5.

Peripheral circuit of MSP430F123 as a single chip\nmicrocomputer.\nD1 is greater than its operating voltage, the metal-oxide-\nsemiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor (MOSFET) will operate\nin the triode region and the secondary output of the power\nsupply coil will be shorted, then the coil will not charge the\ncapacitor C.\nA LP2950CDT-3.3G is used as the DC-DC conversion\nchip, which can realize a DC output of 3.3V . MSP430F123\nmicroprocessor is employed to control the temperature sen-\nsor, receive data from the sensors, and control the wireless\ntransceiver circuit, according to the application environment\nand requirements of the temperature measurement system.\nThe peripheral circuit includes SCM, reset circuit, clock cir-\ncuit and program download circuit as shown in Fig.6. The\ntransmitter circuit at the high voltage side is facilitated to\ntransmit the measured data wirelessly to the receiver that is\nmounted at the low voltage side of the electronic instrument\ntransformer.\nAt present, the main technologies of short-range wire-\nless communication technologies include ZigBee, Nordic\n2.4G, Wi-Fi, 3G/HSDPA, WiMAX, UWB, and Bluetooth.\nThese main wireless communication methods usually adopt\n2.4GHz frequency band for short-range communication [34].\nConsidering cost, power consumption and transmission rate,\nnRF24L01 chip is utilized for the wireless transmission\ncircuit. The circuit contains wireless transceiver module,\nRF power ampliﬁer and microwave switch as shown in Fig.7.\nB. DESIGN OF RECEIVING MODULE\nThe temperature data of the transmission module is trans-\nmitted using wireless transmission to the receiving module.\nAn optical ﬁber is used to connect the receiving module\nFIGURE 7. Principle diagram of wireless transceiver circuit.\nFIGURE 8. Detailed diagram of the receiving module.\nand the merging unit. Data from merging unit are trans-\nmitted to the upper computer through a network cable\nusing IEC 61850-9-2 communication protocol. The receiving\nmodule consists of power supply, microprocessor, wireless\ntransceiver circuit and electro-optical conversion circuit as\nshown in Fig.8.\nThe MSP430F147 microprocessor in Fig. 8 has 32k\nFALSH and 1k RAM capacity. The concept of the wireless\ntransceiver circuit of the receiving module is the same as that\nof the transmission module, while it is set to receiving mode\nin the software design. An external antenna is used to enhance\nthe sensitivity of the receiving module.\nIt is to be noted that all hardware components used in\ndeveloping the hardware model are of average operational life\nof 20 years based on manufacturer data. So, it is expected that\nthe life of the proposed hardware model to be the same unless\nexternal accelerating aging factors contribute in decreasing\nthis expected life. Aging assessment of this model requires\nfurther in-depth analysis. The daily power consumption of the\ndeveloped model is approximately in the range 15 - 20 mW.\nC. SOFTWARE DESIGN\nThe developed software includes software of the SCM\nand the monitoring software on the upper computer. The\nsoftware function in the SCM is mainly to perform the\nVOLUME 7, 2019 97617\nZ. Liet al.: New Online Temperature Compensation Technique for Electronic Instrument Transformers\nFIGURE 9. Flow chart of the SCM and receiving circuit software.\ncommunications between microprocessor, temperature sen-\nsor, wireless transceiver module, and the upper computer. The\nsoftware in the upper computer is used to process the temper-\nature data and realize real-time monitoring of the temperature\nwithin the electronic transformer.\n1) SOFTWARE OF SCM AND RECEIVING CIRCUIT\nThe developed software ﬂow chart shown in Fig.9 interacts\nwith the temperature sensor and the wireless transceiver mod-\nule. Due to the expected harsh electromagnetic operating\nenvironment, the MSP430 chip may experience malfunction\nand its program may not work properly. To resolve the issue\nand to prevent loss of control, a watchdog timer is included\nin the software program. The system will be automatically\nreset when the program is running abnormally due to interfer-\nence. In addition, cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is adopted\nto verify the data of temperature sensor and determine the\ncorrectness of the temperature measurement data.\nThe function of the software at the receiving circuit is to\nobtain the temperature data from the transmitter and commu-\nnicate it to the merging unit through the optical ﬁber with\nthe MODBUS protocol. The setup of the watchdog timer,\ninitialization of MSP430 and the wireless transceiver module\nin this program are basically the same as those in the SCM\nsoftware.\n2) SOFTWARE OF THE UPPER COMPUTER\nThe monitoring software of the upper computer is devel-\noped using Labview. The software comprises three main\nparts: software interface between the upper computer and the\nreceiving module, query-response message frame processing\nin IEC 61850-9-2 protocol, display and preservation of tem-\nperature data. The software dashboard is shown in Fig.10\nwhich can simultaneously display up to six channels of tem-\nperature data.\nIV. PROPOSED SYSTEM TESTING AND APPLICATION\nA. ACCURACY TEST\nIn this test, a temperature control box is used to carry out the\naccuracy assessment of the proposed system in measuring a\nwide range of temperatures. Six temperature sensors along\nwith the developed transmission modules are placed into\nthe temperature control box. At the same time, a standard\nFLUKE multi-meter with k-type thermocouple is utilized\n97618 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Liet al.: New Online Temperature Compensation Technique for Electronic Instrument Transformers\nTABLE 1. Results of the proposed system accuracy test.\nFIGURE 10. Monitoring software dashboard of the upper computer.\nto compare the results of the proposed temperature mea-\nsurement system with. The temperature measuring range of\nthe thermocouple is −55◦C to +400◦C with accuracy and\nmaximum resolution of ±1.0% and 0 .1◦C, respectively. The\nenvironment temperature in the control box is changed in a\nwide range while the temperature measurements using the\nstandard thermocouple and the proposed developed system\nare recorded in Table I. The results reveal the high accu-\nracy of the proposed temperature measurement system. The\nerror between the measured temperature using the 6 channels\n(channel 0 to 5 in Table I) and that of the standard thermo-\ncouple is very small as shown in Fig.11.\nB. WIRELESS TRANSMISSION DISTANCE TEST\nThe distance of wireless transmission is one of the key\ndesign features of the proposed wireless temperature mea-\nsurement system. To assess this criterion in the developed\nsystem, unshielded and shielded tests were performed. The\nunshielded test is carried out in an open ﬁeld while the\nshielded test is carried out by placing the transmission module\nin an aluminum sealed box. Test results are summarized\nbelow:\nFIGURE 11. Percentage error of each channel of the proposed system\nwith respect to the standard thermocouple measurement.\n1) UNSHIELDED TEST\nAccurate temperature data can be received within a distance\nof 80 meters between the transmission and receiving modules\nwithout any barrier. Beyond this distance, data interruption is\ntaking place. This distance is reduced to 50 meters with any\nkind of barriers such as a wall between the two modules.\n2) SHIELDED TEST\nAccurate temperature data can be received within 50 meters\nwithout any barrier, which is reduced to 30 meters with a\nbarrier between the two modules.\nIt is worth mentioning that the receiving module is placed\nat the transformer base while the transmission module is\ninstalled at the top high voltage side. Hence, the separa-\ntion distance is much less than 30 meters which meets the\napplication requirement. Other wireless transmission com-\nmunication technology such as LTE module that has longer\ntransmission distance and wider range of applications, can be\nalso employed in the developed system.\nC. PRACTICAL APPLICATION\nThe developed wireless temperature measurement system\nshown in Fig.12(a) is used within the electronic instrument\nVOLUME 7, 2019 97619\nZ. Liet al.: New Online Temperature Compensation Technique for Electronic Instrument Transformers\nFIGURE 12. Practical application of the developed system (a) Wireless temperature measurement system, (b) Electronic instrument transformer.\nTABLE 2. Temperature Compensation Effect Test for Current.\ntransformer shown in Fig.12(b). The transformer rated volt-\nage and current are 110kV and 2kA, respectively. The tem-\nperature performance of the electronic transformer is tested\nand the measured current and voltage data without the com-\npensation of the temperature effect are recorded in Tables II\nand III, respectively. In this test, the transformer is placed\nin a large temperature-controlled cabinet at which the sur-\nrounding temperature can be controlled in a wide range from\n−40◦C to 70 ◦C. The developed system can measure the\ntemperature at every 5 seconds. On the other hand, the voltage\nand current sampling frequency of the electronic instrument\ntransformer is usually 4 kHz or higher. In Tables II and III,\nthe percentage magnitude error and the phase error in the\nmeasured current and voltage signals are calculated using the\nfollowing formula:\nPercentage magnitude error =XT −XS\nXS\n×100% (1)\nPhase error =ϕT −ϕS (2)\nwhere, XT and XS are the root mean square voltage or current\nmeasured using the electronic instrument transformer and a\nstandard current (CT)/ potential (PT) transformers, respec-\ntively while ϕT and ϕS are the corresponding phase angles\nthat are calculated using Fast Fourier Transform. The test was\nconducted in accordance to the IEC standards [35], [36]. It\ncan be seen from Table II that by reducing the temperature\nwithin the temperature-controlled cabinet from 50 .4◦C to\n−39.2◦C, the current measured using the standard CT is\nincreasing by 3.8% which is attributed to the reduction in\nthe conductor resistance with the decrease in the surrounding\ntemperature. On the other hand, a voltage variation of 1.3%\nis noticed in the standard PT reading when the temperature\nis reduced within the same range. Due to its sensitivity to\ntemperature variation, the reading of the electronic instru-\nment transformer exhibits an error in both magnitude and\nangle of the measured current and voltage signals when\ncompared with the reading of the standard CT and PT as\nshown in columns 3 and 4 in Tables II and III; respectively.\n97620 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Liet al.: New Online Temperature Compensation Technique for Electronic Instrument Transformers\nTABLE 3. Temperature Compensation Effect Test for Voltage.\nIt can be observed that without compensation, some current\nand voltage measurements will exhibit error more than the\nstandard permissible limit of ±0.2% as highlighted in bold\nfont in Tables II and III. With the proposed temperature com-\npensation, the ratio error in all current and voltage reading\nhas been reduced to a level less than 0.05%.\nEven though the error in the electronic instrument trans-\nformer reading with the variation of environment temper-\nature seems to be insigniﬁcant, this small error may lead\nto malfunction in the protection and control systems. For\nexample, at −38.9◦C, the error in the RMS current mea-\nsured by the electronic instrument transformer was found to\nbe −0.2259%. This current is less than the actual current\nmeasured by the standard CT. If the protection relay setting\nwas above the reading revealed by the electronic current\ntransformer, the protection system will not be activated due\nto such error. Hence it is essential to compensate the temper-\nature effect on the measurement accuracy of the electronic\ninstrument transformers as will be elaborated below.\nAssuming at a given temperature T , the compensation\ncoefﬁcients for the current magnitude and phase are respec-\ntively denoted by rC and pC and by rV and pV for the voltage\nmagnitude and phase. The least square method is used to\ncalculate the ﬁtting curves of the percentage magnitude error\nand phase error in Tables II and III with the temperature as\nper Eqs.3-6 below :\nrC =2.191∗10−6T 3 −4.343∗10−5T 2\n−7.519∗10−4T −0.0365 (3)\npC =−8.110∗10−5T 3 +0.0023T 2\n+0.0202T −0.6414 (4)\nrV =5.708∗10−6T 3 −2.227∗10−4T 2\n−7.010∗10−4T −0.0321 (5)\npV =−1.872∗10−5T 3 +7.999∗10−4T 2\n−0.0441T +0.4981 (6)\nThese equations are used to compensate the effect of tem-\nperature variations on the output current and voltage readings\nof the electronic current transformer. For example, the follow-\ning formula is used to compensate the effect of temperature\nvariations on the magnitude of the root mean square current\nmeasured by the electronic current transformer :\nITH =(1 − rC\n100) ×ITB (7)\nwhere ITH is the compensated current reading and ITB is the\nreading before compensation.\nAs can be seen in the compensated data in Tables II and III,\nthe wireless temperature measurement system can measure\nthe temperature and perform accurate compensation to cor-\nrect the electronic instrument transformer reading. For exam-\nple, at a temperature of −38.9◦C, the error in the RMS\ncurrent measured by the electronic instrument transformer is\nreduced from −0.2259% to only −0.0458%. This reveals the\nrobustness of the proposed compensation technique.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThis paper designs and implements a new wireless tempera-\nture measurement and compensation system that resolves the\npoor thermal stability issues associated with electronic instru-\nment transformers and improves their measurement accuracy.\nThe proposed technology consists of a transmitter mounted at\nthe high voltage side, receiving unit mounted at the low volt-\nage side and an upper computer software monitoring system.\nConsidering the harsh electromagnetic operating environ-\nment of the transformer high voltage side, an anti-interference\ndesign is considered in the developed hardware and software\nsystems to effectively ensures the accuracy of the temperature\nVOLUME 7, 2019 97621\nZ.

Accuracy test and ﬁeld application of the\ndeveloped system reveal that it can accurately measure the\ntemperature within the electronic instrument transformer and\ncompensate the effect of temperature variations on its thermal\nstability and measured current and voltage data. The pro-\nposed temperature measurement and compensation system is\nmodular and is easy to implement within existing electronic\ninstrument transformers.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H. Wu, C. Jiao, X. Cui, X.
