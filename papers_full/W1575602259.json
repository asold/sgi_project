It aims not only at replacing the traditional\ntransformer, but at providing also ancillary services to the grid,\nthanks to the greater ﬂexibility offered by power electronics.\nHowever, in the case of grid overload caused by high load demand\nor high production from renewable energy sources, the power\nelectronics have no extra capability. The power semiconductors\ncan be overloaded only for few microseconds, in contrast with the\ngrid components requirement of bearing currents higher than\nthe rated values for several seconds. Thus the ST needs new\nprocedures for dealing with the transients/conditions of the high\ncurrent requests by the load. This paper presents the Frequency-\nBased Overload Control (FBOC), an innovative procedure for the\noverload management that acts in coordination with the droop\ncontroller of Distributed Generation (DG) systems, enabling the\nlimitation of the transformer current.\nIndex Terms—Current Limitation - Droop Control - Smart\nTransformer - Solid State Transformer\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThe massive implementation of the DG and the presence of\nnew components (Electric Vehicles, Battery Energy Storage\nSystems, etc.) are changing the operative conditions of the\nLow V oltage (LV) and Medium V oltage (MV) grids. These\ngrids, initially designed for being passive, are now working\nwith power transients, mostly caused by the Distributed Gen-\neration (DG) intermittent nature. Difﬁcult voltage control, no\nproper breaker operations, and islanding detection are just\nsome of the issues created by these resources [1].\nThe Smart Transformer (ST) represents an interesting option\nfor interfacing MV with LV grids in presence of DG of\ndifferent nature. Being a power electronics-based transformer,\nit guarantees greater ﬂexibility in the LV and MV grids\nmanagement than the traditional transformer [2].\nExisting intelligent transformer technologies are already on\nthe market. These are mostly related to the adjustment of the\nvoltage set point, such as Load Tap Changer (LTC) technology.\nHybrid solutions implementing power electronics switches\nhave been proposed in the literature [3], [4] or implemented\nin real applications [5], [6] for LTC. The power electronics\nswitches limits the current ﬂowing in the mechanical switch\nduring the tap changing transient in order to increase the\nlifespan of the LTC mechanical switches. However these\nintelligent transformers can only modify the voltage ratio, but\nwith slow dynamics. They cannot perform any fast transient\noptimization and neither can they provide further services\nto the grid. In case of harmonic compensation, current and\nvoltage balancing, disturbance rejection, other devices with\nfaster dynamics, e.g. FACTS, are needed. As can be noted\nin Fig. 1, the ST not only comply with the task to transform\nthe voltage but it is able to provide additional services that\nthe previous examples of transformer with some degree of\nintelligences cannot provide.\n+2\n+1\nN\n-1\n-2\nV1\nV2\nNsteps\nLF\n+2\n+1\nN\n-1\n-2\nV1\nV2\nNsteps\nLF HF\nGRID\nV2V1\nLTC Solution Hybrid Solution Smart Transformer \nSolution\nGRID GRID\nINFORMATION FLOW\nENERGY FLOW\nFig. 1. Comparison between ST and the existing transformer technologies.\nIn contrast with other transformer technologies, the ST can\ndecouple the LV and MV grids: the behavior of the two\ngrids is separated and from the electrical point of view they\noperate independently. This feature is enabled by the presence\nof the two DC links, in the LV and MV sides. The inverter,\ninterfacing the LV grid side, controls the voltage waveform\nin agreement with the voltage requirements of the LV grids.\nThus the ST has several degrees of freedom regarding the\nwaveforms: it manages the magnitude, the phase and the\nfrequency of the voltage, having the possibility to modify these\nparameters if needed, independently of the MV grid.\nSince the LV side of the transformer is electrically isolated,\nit operates essentially like a microgrid [7]. A microgrid in\nisolated operation is normally controlled by a master controller\n(setting the frequency), while other active power sources are\ncontrolled by droop controllers [8]. An interesting option is\nproposed in [9], where the microgrid control is achieved with\nhierarchical controllers: a primary control regulates the inner\ncontrol of the DG; a secondary control takes care of the\nfrequency and voltage deviations from the rated value; and a\ntertiary control regulates the power exchange among the DG\nand the grid at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC).\nThe ST enables all of the previous options, simplifying the\ncontrol aspect: the voltage and frequency control is coordi-\nnated by the ST imposing the voltage waveform. In the ST\ngrid scenario the DG must only perform the inner control and\neventually a tertiary control based on grid optimization.\nThe ST creates new control possibilities for both LV and\nMV side. In [10] the balancing of the current in MV grid and\nthe voltage in LV grid sides in presence of unbalanced load\nis demonstrated. Thus power quality is improved in both grid\nsides without applying any further devices in the grid.\nEven though power electronics devices provide new services\nto the grid, they tend to be more expensive than traditional\ncomponents. Their design and sizing need to be studied and\nplanned carefully in order to reduce the overall cost. Cost\nreduction imposes strict limits to the power electronics capa-\nbility, and, in exceptional cases, the adoption of emergency\nprocedures to avoid any damages to the components. Thus the\nST must be properly designed for the application environment,\nbut cannot be oversized to take into account extreme situations.\nWhen the current is approaching the ST current hard limits, a\nproper control action is needed to avoid system shutdown: the\nsemiconductors have hard current limits, and their violations\nresult in a reduction of components lifespan or failures, so the\nST is forced to switch off in order to preserve its safety and\navoid any possible damage.\nThe wide implementation in LV grids of DG systems, some\nof which have the capacity for active power modulation,\ncan be used to perform a decentralized control action, in\norder to solve the overload at ST level. In this paper the\nFrequency-Based Overload Control of Smart Transformers\n(FBOC) method is presented, exploiting the presence of droop\ncontrollers in the DG. The remaining of the paper is structured\nas follows: Section II analyzes the ST concept and control;\nSection III depicts the FBOC method; Section IV describes the\nbenchmark grid and Section V shows the simulation results.\nSection VI is dedicated to the conclusions.\nII. ST C ONCEPT AND CONTROL\nThe main feature of the ST is the power electronics inter-\nfaces with the grid [2]. The ST is a 3-stage converter composed\nof grid connected converters at the LV and MV grid interfaces\nand a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter [11]. The DAB has\nthe task to transform the voltage from MV to LV by means\nof an high frequency transformer (within the range of several\nkHz). The use of a DAB in transforming the voltage enables\nthe creation of two DC links at the MV and LV side, separating\nelectrically the two grids. Fig. 2 depicts the ST concept by\nmeans of a single-line diagram:\nloadv\nMV\ngridv\nloadZ\nMV\nabcv\nLV\nabcv\nMV\ngridi\nHF\nDC\nAC DC\nAC\nLV\nDCv\nMV\nDCvDC\nAC DC\nAC\nFig. 2. ST 3-stage topology: single-line diagram.\nIn this paper the average model of the ST has been imple-\nmented and the control block diagrams are shown in Fig. 3.\nAs can be deducted from Fig. 3, the ST control has been\nimplemented as three independent controllers in parallel.\nThe LV side AC control is a double loop controller. The\nouter loop is ﬁxing the voltage to the rated value, indepen-\ndently of load current values. The output of the outer loop\ngives the reference signal to the inner loop: being a continue\nvalue, the output of the outer controller must be transferred in a\nsinusoidal three-phase system, in order to be comparable with\nthe grid voltage waveforms, before to be sent to the voltage\ncontroller. Here the inner loop compensates the difference\nbetween the grid voltage and the voltage reference by means\nof a Proportional+Resonant controller. Finally, the voltage\nreference is added to the controller output as feedforward\nsignal in order to enhance the control action. The LV controller\noutput represents the voltage applied at the converter side, in\norder to have perfectly balanced voltage proﬁles.\nFig. 3(b) shows the LV DC link control, where the DC-DC\nconverter has the task to keep constant the voltage on the DC\nlink, regulating the output power (in case of power transfer\nfrom MV to LV grid). The capacitor voltage input to the LV\nDC link is compared with the rated voltage value and sent to\na Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. The controller output is\nthe active power demanded from the MV side in order to keep\nconstant the voltage in the LV DC link.\nThe controller in Fig. 3(c) represents the MV side converter.\nThe Proportional controller compensates the error between\nthe voltage reference and the voltage meter reading in the\nMV DC link. Here the signal is low-pass ﬁltered and sent to\nthe AC side controller, converting it in a three-phase system,\nas described in the LV controller. The new current reference\nvalue is compared with the current reading from the meters\nand sent to a Proportional+Resonant controller in order to\nminimize the error between the two signals. Finally the voltage\nfeedforward signal is added after the resonant controller. The\nvoltage generated is the one needed for demanding the correct\namount of current from the MV grid in order to keep the DC\nlink voltage at the rated value.\nIII. F REQUENCY -BASED OVERLOAD CONTROL\nWith the purpose of providing ancillary services to the grid,\nsome forms of the DG are usually equipped with a frequency\ndroop active power controller. This controller compensates any\nfrequency variation in the grid by modifying the generator\nactive power. The FBOC method aims to exploit the droop\nVoltage\nController\nRMS Voltage \nController\nLV\nabcv\nRMS\n  tsin\nLV\ngridv\n*\nRMSgridv \n*\ngridv\nCurrent\nController\nMV\nabcv\nMV\ngridv\nMV\ngridi\nMV\nDCV\n*MV\nDCVLPF\nDC \nVoltage \nController\n*MV\ngridi\n)a\n)b\nDC Voltage\nController\nLV\nDCV\nN\nV MV\nDC\nDCP\n)c\n  tsin\nFig. 3.

The ST solves the overloading problem modifying the\ngrid frequency and activating the distributed generation droop\ncontroller. When the current is approaching the hard limit\nand exceeds the set security threshold, the ST lowers the\nfrequency and lets the DG increase the injected active power\nto compensate the frequency drop. When the current returns\nbelow the security limit, the ST restores the nominal frequency\nand the DG comes back to the original power setpoint. It is\nworth mentioning that this method has a minimal impact on\nthe normal operation of the grid, avoiding long term changes\nin the frequency value.\nFig. 4 describes the FBOC method: the controller decides to\nact on the frequency value, depending on the current reading\nfrom the LV grid. If the current rms value exceeds the current\nsecurity limit, the FBOC controller changes the reference\nsetpoint and generates a three-phase voltage waveform with\nthe new frequency value. Here the voltage waveforms are\ncompared with the voltage references and the error signal sent\nto a controller. The controller output, added to the feedforward\nsignal of the voltage references, is sent to the LV side inverter\nof the ST and applied as new voltage waveform.\nIV. B ENCHMARK GRID\nIn modern and future LV grids a considerable part of the\npower can be provided locally by DG. This possibility enables\nthe internal management of the LV grid load power.The grid\nshown in Fig. 5 represents a possible future grid paradigm\nincluding passive loads, renewable and controllable energy\nresources.

The\nasynchronous machine is directly coupled with the electrical\ngrid, without the interposition of any converter. This represents\nthe most common case for small Diesel generators and also\nthe most conservative one, due to the lack of control for the\nreactive power absorption. In order to compensate partially the\nreactive power at the generator level, a capacitors bank has\nbeen added of 150 kV Ar. The overall controller is composed\nof two fuel signals, the ﬁrst one coming from the governor and\nthe second one coming from the droop controller, as described\nin Fig. 6. The ﬁrst fuel signal is given by the active power\nreference signal. This reference is directly proportional to the\nfuel valve opening, in order to control directly the active power\ninjection in the grid. The second fuel signal is given by the\nfrequency droop controller that detects the difference of the\ngrid frequency with respect to the rated value. If the frequency\ndrops, the controller gives a positive fuel signal, increasing the\nopening of the fuel valve. The engine injects more power in\nthe grid providing locally energy to the loads and reducing the\ncurrent burden at the ST level.\nrefP\nDIESEL\nENGINE\nF\nGovernor\n0f\nf\n+ - LV\ngrid\n+\n+\nIG\n3\ndk\nFig. 6.

S IMULATION RESULTS\nThe study case describes an emergency situation when the\nload demand exceeds the ST capacity and the LV grid is\nsustained with the help of the Diesel engine and the wind\nturbine. Due to the variability of the wind speed, the power\noutput of the wind turbine changes. With low wind speed the\nwind turbine power output decreases and the feeder current\nincreases overloading the ST. In this work two current limits\nare set: the Current Security Limit, set to 950A rms, that\nactivates the overload control, and the Current Hard Limit,\nimposed at 1000A rms, corresponding to the real current\ncapacity of the ST. The difference between the two limits\ngives the necessary security margin in the control action. The\nsimulations have been performed in PSCAD/EMTDC R⃝, with\na timestep of 100µs.\nIn Fig. 7 the variability of the wind speed proﬁle is de-\nscribed. When the wind speed decreases, the production of the\nwind power plant decreases with the cube of the wind speed\nand the power provided by the ST increases to compensate the\ndifference. Imposing a ﬁxed voltage, the amount of current\nFig. 7. Wind speed proﬁle.\nFig. 8. Current proﬁle with (blu line) and without (red line) current-frequency\ncontrol, current security limit (light green line), and current hard limit (dark\ngreen line).\nﬂowing in the ST increases proportionally to the power,\nleading towards limit violations of the ST current capability.\nThis is shown in Fig. 8, where, without a proper control the\ncurrent goes above the ST hard limit in several points, where\nthe wind speed is lower. If this situation persists the ST will\nbe forced to shut down, in order to prevent any damage to the\nsemiconductor components.\nTo avoid a possible ST shutdown, as soon as the current\nexceeds the security limit, the control explained in Section III\noperates and lowers the frequency obtaining the DG power\nincrease. The current ﬂowing in the ST is kept under control\nand never violates its hard limit. Due to controller time con-\nstants, small security limit violations occure, always however\nwithin the security band.\nFig. 9 depicts the frequency trend when the control action\nis applied. The frequency variation has been kept to the min-\nimum, tuning properly the controller gain in the ST control.\nThe control must always comply with the grid requirements,\nmostly regarding the frequency deviation from the rated value.\nHere a minimum value of 49.8Hz has been set in order to avoid\nlarge deviations from the rated value.\nFig. 10 shows the active power injected and reactive power\nabsorbed (with inverted sign) by the asynchronous generator\nassociated to the Diesel engine. During the transient, the\ndroop control drives the generator to inject more active power,\nreacting to the frequency decrease. As can be stated from\nFig. 10, when the control action is not applied the generator\nreturns to its original setpoint. This minimizes the effect of\nthe the overload control on the generator.\nFig. 9. Grid frequency proﬁle applying the control action.\nFig. 10. Diesel generator active (blue line) and reactive (green line) power.\nFig. 11. Diesel generator active power with (blue line) and without (red line)\ncontrol.\nFig. 12. Diesel generator reactive power with (blue line) and without (red\nline) control.\nFig. 11 and Fig. 12 show the active and reactive power\nproﬁle of the ST. As it can be noticed, the active power\ndecreases during the transients, due to the contribution of the\nDiesel engine, and the reactive power increase only marginally\nduring the application of the control action.\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nThis paper has described a possible solution to the ST\noverloading problem in presence of controllable DG. In emer-\ngency situation, the FBOC allows the DG power re-dispatch\nin order to reduce the ST current burden, impacting minimally\non the LV grid. The control action provides a solution to\nthe overloading problem during the transients, letting the\nsystem work at the frequency rated value in the absence of\nan emergency.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe research leading to these results has received funding\nfrom the European Research Council under the European\nUnion’s Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013) /\nERC Grant Agreement n.
