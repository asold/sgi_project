Challenges of Gemini, ChatGPT and other large language models in teaching and \nlearning \nDiminished Creativity and Personalization  \nWhile AI -generated assignments offer personalization to a certain extent, they may lack the \ncreativity and personal touch that a human teacher can provide [1,10]. The human element in \nteaching entails empathy, understanding, and the capacity to tailor assignments in accordance with \na student's unique strengths and weaknesses. AI systems may not adeptly capture these nuances.  \nRisk of Plagiarism  \nAs AI-generated assignments become increasingly sophisticated, students might employ AI to craft \nassignments and present them as their original work [11,12]. This raises concerns of plagiarism, \nrendering it challenging for educators to differentiate betwee n genuine student work and AI -\ngenerated content. The utilization of AI -driven tools such as ChatGPT in the realm of education has \nyielded both advantages and apprehensions, with one of the most prominent concerns revolving \naround the specter of plagiarism [13,14]. Plagiarism arises when students present the work or ideas \nof others as their own, and AI tools have the unintended capacity to exacerbate this issue in multiple \nways. In the first instance, ChatGPT produces text that can often pass as human -authored content. \nConsequently, when students employ this AI for their academic assignments or essays, they may \ninadvertently integrate entire or partial responses generated by ChatGPT without adhering to the \nnecessary citations, thereby infringing upon establis hed academic integrity norms. Secondly, AI -\npowered content generation simplifies the process of \"copy and paste\" from the internet, bypassing \nthe need for comprehensive research and genuine comprehension. This shortcut undermines the \neducational process by  circumventing the requirement for in -depth investigation, thereby fostering \na shallow grasp of the subject matter and knowledge deficiencies.  \nFurthermore, ChatGPT might, without intention, supply incorrect or misleading information [15,16]. \nIf students incorporate such data into their academic work, it can detrimentally impact the quality \nand precision of their submissions. To counteract the per il of plagiarism within educational settings, \ninstitutions and educators must institute proactive strategies. These measures may encompass \ncomprehensive instruction on plagiarism and citation conventions, the promotion of critical thinking \nand original tho ught, and the implementation of plagiarism detection software. Additionally, they \nshould adapt assignments and assessments to necessitate personal analysis, interpretation, and the \nsynthesis of information, making it more challenging for students to rely s olely on AI -generated \ncontent. Although AI tools like ChatGPT have the potential to augment the educational experience, \nthey concurrently pose a substantial risk of plagiarism owing to their ability to generate text that \nclosely resembles human authorship.  It is imperative for educational institutions to remain watchful \nand proactive in addressing this challenge, thus upholding academic integrity and cultivating a \ngenuine learning environment.  \nEthical Considerations  \nThe use of AI-generated assignments raises ethical dilemmas [17]. Educators must weigh the impact \non students, including the potential deprivation of authentic learning experiences through excessive \nreliance on AI. It is essential to ensure that AI -generated assignments conform to ethical and \nTESOL and Technology Studies   5 \neducational standards. The incorporation of AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, into the field of education \nraises numerous ethical considerations [18]. Foremost among these is the imperative to prioritize \ndata privacy and security, ensuring the protection of student data and its exclusive use for educational \npurposes. Obtaining informed consent is a fundamental requirement, ensuring that both students and \ntheir guardians are fully informed about the utilization of AI, data management, and the option to \nopt out if any concerns arise. Addressing issues of bias and fairness is paramount, as AI models can \ninadvertently inherit biases from their training data. Proactive measures are necessary to minimize \nany potential discriminatory effects. Transparency is of utmost importance, with educational \ninstitutions obligated to be forthcoming about both the utilization of AI and its limitations. \nPreserving the role of educators, maintaining human supervision and accountability, is vital to ensure \nthat AI enhances the learning  experience without replacing it [19]. Striking a balance between \ncustomization and accessibility is crucial. Furthermore, the long -term implications, such as job \ndisplacement and cultural sensitivity, should be carefully considered. Additionally, it is es sential to \ndefine intellectual property rights and establish mechanisms for accountability and redress. \nAchieving this equilibrium is imperative in the responsible utilization of AI's potential within the \nrealm of education.  \nData Privacy and Security  \nAI-generated assignments may necessitate the collection and storage of student data, invoking \nconcerns about data privacy and security. Educational institutions must ensure that the data used for \ngenerating assignments is safeguarded and used responsibly.  \nLearning Quality \nA potential concern is that ChatGPT and similar AI -generated assignments may not consistently \nyield high -quality educational experiences [20,21]. While AI can generate content, it may not \npossess an in -depth understanding of the pedagogical principles that  underpin effective teaching. \nConsequently, educators must ascertain that the quality of AI -generated assignments aligns with \ntheir educational objectives.  \n4. The Role of Teachers \nAmid the advantages and challenges inherent to AI -generated assignments, the role of educators in \nthis evolving educational landscape holds a pivotal significance [22,23]. Teachers should \ncontemplate the following aspects when determining whether to embrac e and implement AI -\ngenerated assignments:  \nAugmentation, Not Replacement  \nAI-generated assignments should be viewed as tools that enhance the teaching and learning process, \nnot as substitutes for teachers. Teachers can leverage AI -generated assignments to free up time for \nmore personalized instruction, mentorship, and support.  \nQuality Assurance  \nEducators should actively participate in curating and overseeing assignments generated by AI \nsystems. They can review, modify, or endorse assignments to ensure they align with the educational \nobjectives and standards of their curriculum.  \nEthical Considerations  \n6    Rane: Enhancing the quality of teaching and learning through Gemini, ChatGPT, and similar generative Artificial \nIntelligence: Challenges, future prospects, and ethical considerations in education \nTeachers must remain vigilant regarding the ethical implications of deploying AI -generated \nassignments. They should weigh the impact on students' intellectual development and assess whether \nAI usage aligns with their educational philosophy and ethical prin ciples. \nBalance Between Automation and Human Element  \nStriking the right balance between automation and the human element in education is imperative. \nWhile AI can streamline administrative tasks and offer feedback, educators should continue \nproviding emotional support, guidance, and mentorship, elements that AI systems cannot replace.  \nTraining and Professional Development  \nAs AI continues to evolve, teachers should receive training and professional development to \neffectively integrate AI -generated assignments into their teaching and learning practices. This \nensures that educators are well-prepared to harness the benefits of AI while addressing its challenges. \n5. Conclusions:  \nAI-enhanced submissions in education signify a promising development with the potential to amplify \nthe efficiency, personalization, and overall quality of the learning experience. Nevertheless, they \nalso introduce challenges related to creativity, ethics, and the human dimension of teaching. The \ndecision of whether teachers should accept assignments generated by Gemini, ChatGPT or any AI -\ngenerated content should be approached with deliberate consideration of their educational goals, the \nneeds of their stude nts, and their ethical principles. Ultimately, AI -generated assignments should be \nseen as potent tools that augment the role of educators rather than replacing them. The optimal \napproach involves the judicious integration of AI technologies, with teachers guiding and \nsupervising AI -generated assignments to ensure alignment with their educational objectives, \npreserving the indispensable human touch in the learning process. The future of AI in education \nundoubtedly holds immense promise, and it falls upon edu cators, institutions, and policymakers to \nshape its trajectory and guarantee that AI contributes positively to the educational realm.
