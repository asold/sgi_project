The forecasting of critical events,\nsuch as pandemic outbreak, civil unrest, and international con-\nflicts, can help shape policies in advance and minimize potential\nimpacts [50]. Due to its great potential application value, temporal\nevent forecasting [14, 23, 28, 30] has garnered increasing attention\nfrom both the academic and industrial community. Despite promis-\ning progress, current methods have ignored the rich multimodal\ninformation, e.g., images, leaving this an unexplored research gap.\nWith the enormous success of LLMs, an increasing number\nof studies [4, 16, 24, 27, 44, 46, 49] have been exploring LLMs to\ntackle the temporal event forecasting problem. These pioneering\nworks explore the application of LLMs in the task of temporal\nevent forecasting, leveraging techniques such as in-context learning\n(ICL) [16, 49], instruction tuning [27, 44], and retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) [4, 37]. Compared to LLM-based methods, tradi-\ntional methods have several shortcomings in terms of effectiveness,\nflexibility, and scalability. Specifically, traditional non-LLM meth-\nods [15, 22, 29, 30, 33], whether based on structured or unstruc-\ntured data, typically require large-scale well-annotated datasets.\nMoreover, model selection is often a challenge for these traditional\nmethods due to high computational costs. Additionally, traditional\nmethods generally require separate training for different datasets,\nas a result, they often struggle to make fast adaptationw.r.t.frequent\nchanging in dataset and temporal shifts. Therefore, applying LLMs\nto the task of temporal event forecasting is a worthwhile direction\nto explore [16]. However, all of the existing LLM-based methods\narXiv:2408.04388v1  [cs.MM]  8 Aug 2024\nMM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Haoxuan Li et al.\nHamas-led groups committed ‘numerous war crimes’\nPalestinian militants move towards the border fence with Israel \nfrom Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on October 7.\n“Atrocities do not justify atrocities,” Sawyer said. “……, That’s in \nthe interests of both Palestinians and Israelis.”\nHamas-led armed groups committed \n“numerous war crimes and crimes against \nhumanity” against civilians during the ……\nHighlight\nUkraine faces retreat without US aid, Zelensky says\nThe president said Ukraine’s options depend on what Congress \ndecides.  “We can’t waste time anymore.

We identify two es-\nsential functions of images, i.e., highlighting and complemen-\ntary. By offering auxiliary highlighting or complementary\ninformation, images enhance the understanding of temporal\nevents, thus boosting the forecasting performance.\nonly consider a single modality, such as text [ 16] or graph [ 27],\nwhile ignoring the prevalent visual modality, i.e., images. Some\nprevious works [19, 20] have justified that images are helpful in\nmultimodal event detection [20] and extraction [21, 41], while none\nof them investigate images’ utility in temporal event forecasting.\nTo bridge this gap, we aim to integrate images into temporal\nevent forecasting and construct multimodal temporal event fore-\ncasting models. However, it is a non-trivial objective due to the\nfollowing challenges. First, it is necessary to clarify the function\nbetween visual information and other modal information, i.e., the\ninterplay between visual and non-visual modalities. Next, we need\nto figure out how the function between two modalities can con-\ntribute to the task of temporal event forecasting. Second, previous\nworks [41] that explores the image function typically require large\namounts of labeled training data. Additionally, images serve differ-\nent functions for different specific tasks, so these methods often\nstruggle to generalize effectively to other task definitions. Therefore,\nthere is a pressing need to design an effective method to identify\nthe function between modalities and seamlessly integrating them\ninto LLM-based forecasting models.\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel\nframework for multimodal temporal event forecasting, named as\nMM-Forecast. Specifically, we identify two essential functions of\nimages, i.e., highlighting and complementary. As illustrated in Fig-\nure 1, when the function of associated image is highlighting, the\nimage plays the role of emphasizing the key events. In contrast,\nwhen the function of associated image is complementary, the image\nprovides supplementary information that complements the textual\ncontent. In order to recognize these two types of functions, we\npropose an Image Function Identification module that is based on\nMultimodal LLMs (MLLMs) due to their superior multimodal under-\nstanding and reasoning capabilities in zero-shot settings [18]. This\nproposed module is designed to recognize the function of images in\nhistorical events, and then transform this information into verbal\ndescriptions that can be seamlessly integrated into the LLM-based\nevent forecasting model. Equipping this Image Function Identifica-\ntion module into the overall framework, we integrate it into two dis-\ntinct LLM-based forecasting models,i.e., one based on the in-context\nlearning (ICL) method [16], and the other based on the retrieval-\naugmented generation (RAG) technique [17]. In order to evaluate\nour approach, we construct an exploratory dataset by incorporating\nimages into an existing dataset MidEast-TE-mini [4]. We name this\nnew dataset MidEast-TE-multimodal (short as MidEast-TE-mm).\nIn the final evaluation, with the enhancement of visual information,\nthe temporal event forecasting task achieves superior forecasting\naccuracy compared to the unimodal approach. The experimental\nresults illustrate that our method accurately recognizes the function\nof images in various aspects. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate\nthat multimodal temporal forecasting represents a potential and\npromising research direction worthy of further exploration. The\nmain contributions are as follows:\n•To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study\nof exploring visual information for temporal event forecasting in\nthe era of LLMs.\n•We identify two main functions that images play in temporal\nevent forecasting, and design a framework to recognise and inte-\ngrate visual information into LLM-based forecasting models.\n•Extensive experiments justify that our framework is able to iden-\ntify the functions of images and visual information can enhance\nthe performance of temporal event forecasting. Furthermore,\nthese findings have led to several noteworthy and promising\ndirections for future research.\n2 Related Works\nWe survey the related works of temporal event forecasting and\nLLMs for event analysis.\n2.1 Temporal Event Forecasting\nTemporal event forecasting centers on predicting future event oc-\ncurrences based on historical events, and the typical approaches\ncan be categorized by event format: time series, structured, and\nunstructured events. Regarding the time series paradigm, existing\nworks [2, 23, 31] typically represent events as an ordered sequence\nof data points that describe the progression of actions or occur-\nrences. However, this paradigm inherently fails to represent multi-\nple relationships among entities. Alternatively, another branch of\nworks [8, 15, 22, 29, 33, 36, 38, 45] focus on the prediction of struc-\ntured events, i.e., using graph to represent events, which is known\nas temporal knowledge graph (TKG). Recent works[29, 30] intro-\nduce context into temporal event forecasting models, enhancing\nthe prediction performance by elaborating the event’s occurrence\nsituation. In addition, several studies have explored the use of un-\nstructured textual representations of temporal events, where each\natomic event is generated from multi-document summaries [ 11]\nor event chains [13]. Nonetheless, all of them design forecasting\nMM-Forecast: A Multimodal Approach to Temporal Event Forecasting with Large Language Models MM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\nmodels relying on single modality data. Some works [ 21, 41] ex-\nplore the image utility in event extraction task, while none of them\ninvestigate images’ utility in temporal event forecasting.\n2.2 LLMs for Event Analysis\nThe tremendous success of LLMs in recent years, exemplified by\nChatGPT and its numerous successors [5, 6, 42, 48], has inspired\nresearchers to explore the application of these powerful models\nto various event-related tasks [4, 7, 16, 24, 46, 49]. One area of re-\nsearch focuses on temporal understanding, where LLMs are tested\nfor the task of temporal event ordering or storyline understand-\ning [32, 47, 51]. More works focus on leveraging LLMs to tackle\nthe typical task of temporal reasoning [ 39, 43], while the task of\nforecasting receives much less attention. Deng et al.[7] surveyed\nthe recent advances in event modeling, ranging from graph neural\nnetworks to LLMs. Specifically, GENTKG [24] improves the selec-\ntion of historical event inputs by a temporal logical rule-based re-\ntrieval strategy. Beyond specific methods, more works are focusing\non benchmarking LLMs’ capability in temporal event forecasting.\nZhang et al.[49] propose a method to evaluate the proficiency of\nLLMs in handling temporal dynamics and understanding extensive\ntext through three distinct tasks. And Ye et al. [46] introduce a\nnovel benchmarking environment designed to rigorously assess\nand advance the capabilities of LLM agents for international event\nforecasting over time. Furthermore, Chang et al.[4] propose a uni-\nfied dataset of structured and unstructured data, and systematically\nevaluates LLM-based methods on the task of text-involved temporal\nevent forecasting. However, these existing LLM-based methods still\nsolely rely on single-modality data, potentially missing valuable\ninformation from other modalities, such as images. With the suc-\ncess of LLMs, MLLMs, such as LLaVA [25], and Gemini [40], have\nemerged as promising means for unifying visual and textual modal-\nities. These MLLMs have demonstrated impressive performance\ngain across various visual-language tasks [ 1, 3, 10, 25], suggest-\ning their potential in the task of temporal event forecasting by\nleveraging visual information.\n3 Our Approach: MM-Forecast\nThe overall framework of our proposed approach is depicted in\nFigure 2. We first formally define the multimodal temporal event\nforecasting task in Section 3.1. Second, we specifically introduce the\nkey module of Image Function Identification in Section 3.2. Finally,\nwe elaborate on how to integrate the recognized image functions\ninto LLM-based forecasting models in Section 3.3.\n3.1 Problem Formulation\nTo give formal definition of the problem, we separate it into two sub-\ntasks given the different representations of historical information.\nStructured Event Forecasting (Graph 1). This formulation de-\nfines each event as a quadruple (𝑠,𝑟,𝑜,𝑡 ), which is also called an\natomic event, where 𝑠,𝑟,𝑜,𝑡 corresponds to the subject, relation2,\nobject, and timestamp. At each timestamp 𝑡, all the quadruples\nform an event graph, denoted as𝐺𝑡 = {(𝑠,𝑟,𝑜,𝑡 )}𝑁, where 𝑁 is the\nnumber of events at timestamp 𝑡. Recent work[30] introduces the\n1\"Graph\" is interchangeably used to represent this setting.\n2Relation and event type are interchangeably used in this work\nconcept of complex event (CE) into the structured event represen-\ntation by document clustering, elaborating the event’s occurrence\nsituation or context. Specifically, each atomic event is extended\nfrom a quadruple to a quintuple, i.e., (𝑠,𝑟,𝑜,𝑡,𝑐 ), where 𝑠 ∈ E,\n𝑟 ∈R , 𝑜 ∈E , and 𝑐 ∈C represent the subject, relation, object,\nand CE, respectively; E, Rand Care the entity set, relation set\nand complex context set. Correspondingly, the event graph at each\ntimestamp will be extended as 𝐺𝑡 = {(𝑠,𝑟,𝑜,𝑡,𝑐 )}𝑁. Furthermore,\nin addition event graph, there are images associated with struc-\ntured events, denoted as 𝑉𝑡 = {𝑣1,𝑣2,...,𝑣 𝑚}𝑀\n𝑚=1, where 𝑀 is the\nnumber of images at timestamp 𝑡. Finally, the structured event\nforecasting task can then be formulated as follows: given the histor-\nical event graphs 𝐺<𝑡 = {𝐺0,𝐺1,...,𝐺 𝑡−1}and associated images\n𝑉<𝑡 = {𝑉0,𝑉1,...,𝑉𝑡−1}before timestamp 𝑡, and a query (𝑠,𝑟,𝑡 )or\n(𝑠,𝑜,𝑡 ), the goal is to predict the missing object 𝑜 or relation 𝑟.\nUnstructured Event Forecasting (Text3). In addition to the struc-\ntured event representation, we also consider the unstructured event\nrepresentation, where the historical information is represented in\nthe form of textual sub-events, i.e., 𝐴𝑡 = {𝑎1,𝑎2,...,𝑎 𝑘}𝐾\n𝑘=1 and\n𝐴𝑡 ∈ A, where 𝑎𝑘 denotes the k-th textual sub-events and A\ndenotes the corpus of textual sub-events. The textual sub-events\nare obtained by summarizing the content of news articles. Similar\nto structured event forecasting, textual sub-events have associ-\nated images, denoted as 𝑉<𝑡 = {𝑉0,𝑉1,...,𝑉𝑡−1}. The unstructured\nevent forecasting task can be formulated as: given the historical\ntextual sub-events 𝐴<𝑡 = {𝐴0,𝐴1,...,𝐴 𝑡−1}and associated images\n𝑉<𝑡 = {𝑉0,𝑉1,...,𝑉𝑡−1}before timestamp 𝑡, and a query (𝑠,𝑟,𝑡 )or\n(𝑠,𝑜,𝑡 ), the goal is to predict the missing object 𝑜 or relation 𝑠.\n3.2 Image Function Identification\nIdentifying the function of images in the temporal event forecast-\ning is the key to utilize multimodal visual information. In news\narticles, images play a vital role not only in attracting readers but\nalso in completing and enriching the textual content, especially\nkey event content. We will identify the image functions into three\ncategories, i.e., highlighting, complementary, and irrelevant, during\nthe dataset construction stage. Excluding the irrelevant images, the\nothers serve distinct roles in the temporal event forecasting task. We\npropose an Image Function Identification module to recognize these\nfunctions as verbal descriptions using MLLMs, and subsequently\nincorporate these function descriptions into LLM-based forecasting\nmodels. Specifically, when the function of associated image is high-\nlighting, the visual elements directly support and highlight the key\nsub-events described in the text. These \"highlighting\" sub-events,\nsubstantiated by corroborating information across modalities, can\nbe identified as key events. To determine which sub-event is a key\nevent, we leverage the MLLMs to analyze the images and sub-events\nfrom multiple aspects, including main objects, celebrities, activities,\nenvironment, and labeled items. In cases where the function of\nassociated image is complementary, the visual content contains\ninformation that supplements and extends what is covered in the\nnews text. To more effectively extract the relevant supplementary\ninformation, we consider the following aspects: 1) identify the main\nsubject of the image as the central point, 2) directly relate the ex-\ntracted information to the news event in the article, 3) prioritize the\n3\"Text\" is interchangeably used to represent this setting.\nMM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Haoxuan Li et al.\nMLLM\nHighlighting and  Complementary\n𝑻 𝑽\nHistorical Events (Input)\ntext-sub-events associated images\n: highlighting : complementary\nImage Function Identification Temporal Event Forecasting\nUnstructured\n… … …… …\n𝒕𝟎 𝒕𝟏 𝒕𝒌−𝟏\n User:\nResponse:\n[Query]: (s, r, ?, t)\n[Key events]:\n[Related events]:\n[Compl events]:\n[Options]:    A. xxx  B. xxx  …  E. xxx  F.xxx\nB. xxx\nor\nICL RAG\ngraph-sub-events associated images\nStructured\n… … …… …\n𝒕𝟎 𝒕𝟏 𝒕𝒌−𝟏\n User:\nResponse:\n[Query]: (s, r, ?, t)\n[Key events]:\n[Related events]:\n[Compl events]:\n[Options]:    A. xxx  B. xxx  …  E. xxx  F.xxx\nA. xxx\nor\nICL RAG\n: verbal description of the functions\n: highlighting : complementary\n: verbal description of the functions\nFigure 2: The schematic overview of MM-Forecast.

Our framework is versatile to handle both structured and unstructured\nevents, meanwhile, it is compatible to popular LLM components for event forecasting, i.e., ICL and RAG.\nmost newsworthy visual elements, 4) ensure all information comes\ndirectly from the provided news article without fabrication, and 5)\naim for a concise summary using clear language. By analyzing the\ninterplay between visual images and textual content within news\narticles, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the\nunderlying events and better contextualize the temporal evolution\nof historical events. Ultimately, the prompts utilized in making\npredictions are shown below:\nSYSTEM:\nYou are an assistant to perform event forecasting\nwith the following rules:\n1. The atomic event is the basic unit describing a spec-\nific event, typically presented in the form of a quadru-\nple (S, R, O, T), where S represents the subject, R repre-\nsent the relation, O represents the object, and T repres-\nents the relative time.\n2. When formulating the ultimate prediction, the preemi-\nnent factor to be meticulously weighed and scrutinized\nis the [Key Events]. Complementing this paramount consi-\nderation is the [Related events], which, though ancilla-\nry in nature, serves as a valuable adjunct, furnishing\npertinent contextual details and auxiliary insights to\nfortify the predictive analysis.\n3. Given a query of (S, R, T) in the future and the list\nof historical events until t, event forecasting aims to\npredict the missing object.\nUSER:\n[Query]: (S, O/R, T)\n[Key Events]: xxx.\n[Related Events]: xxx.\n[Options]: A.xxx B.xxx C.xxx D.xxx E.xxx\nThe key events are explicitly highlighted within the prompts, while\ncomplementary information is provided as additional relevant events.\n3.3 Forecasting Framework\nGiven there are few established studies of using LLMs for event\nforecasting, we consider two representative approaches, i.e., In-\ncontext Learning (ICL) [16] and Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG) [17]. Each of these two methods can accept both structured\nand unstructured historical input, and answer the structured fore-\ncasting questions.\n3.3.1 In-context Learning (ICL). In-context learning leverages both\nintrinsic and extrinsic factors to construct historical events. Specif-\nically, the intrinsic factors of an event are related to its inherent\nelements, particularly the subject. In contrast, the extrinsic factors\nare driven by the contextual environment surrounding the event.\nTherefore, whether the data is structured or unstructured, we con-\nstruct the historical events based on the subject and the complex\nevent, separately. The details are as follows:\nMM-Forecast: A Multimodal Approach to Temporal Event Forecasting with Large Language Models MM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\n•Structured Data. For structured data, the method takes the dis-\ncrete event graph as the input. To capture the intrinsic factors,\nwe use the subject of the current event as a guiding clue to con-\nstruct the historical event graph G𝑠\n<𝑡 = {𝐺𝑠\n0,𝐺𝑠\n1,...,𝐺 𝑠\n𝑡−1}, where\n𝐺𝑠\n𝑡 represents historical events graph at timestamp 𝑡 with the\nsame subject as the current event. To account for the extrinsic\nfactors, we construct the historical event graph from the complex\nevent, i.e. G𝑐\n<𝑡 = {𝐺𝑐\n0,𝐺𝑐\n1,...,𝐺 𝑐\n𝑡−1}, where 𝐺𝑐\n𝑡 represents histor-\nical events graph at timestamp 𝑡 with the same complex event\nas the current event. Finally, with the highlighting and comple-\nmentary functions of the images, the input historical event graph\nis G𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 = [G𝑘,G𝑟,G𝑐], where G𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 ∈G𝑠\n<𝑡\nÐG𝑐\n<𝑡 and G𝑘\ndenotes the key events, G𝑟 represents the remaining events, and\nG𝑐 corresponds to the complementary events, respectively.\n•Unstructured Data. For unstructured data, the method takes\nthe textual sub-events as input. Firstly, we identify the events\nby the historical events graph from the subject and complex\nevent and find the corresponding textual sub-events set A𝑠\n<𝑡 =\n{𝐴𝑠\n0,𝐴𝑠\n1,...,𝐴 𝑠\n𝑡−1}and A𝑐\n<𝑡 = {𝐴𝑐\n0,𝐴𝑐\n1,...,𝐴 𝑐\n𝑡−1}through the re-\nlationships between textual sub-events and graph sub-events.\nThen, with the highlighting and complementary functions of\nthe images, the input historical textual sub-events are similarly\nA𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 = [A𝑘,A𝑟,A𝑐], where A𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡 ∈A𝑠\n<𝑡\nÐA𝑐\n<𝑡 and A𝑘 de-\nnotes the key events, A𝑟 represents the remaining events, and\nA𝑐 corresponds to the complementary events, respectively.\n3.3.2 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Despite the rich in-\nformation provided by in-context learning methods, the inherent\nnature of the temporal event means that the existing historical event\nstill contains substantial noise. Inspired by the recent research of\nRAG [17], we also adopt the retrieve-then-generate paradigm to find\nthe most relevant historical events to mitigate the problem of noise.\nSimilar to ICL methods, we utilize two forms of data representation,\nstructured data and unstructured data:\n•Structured Data. Due to the structured nature of the data repre-\nsentation, the event graphs adhered to a unified quintuple format.\nTherefore, we first retrieve the entities that have interacted with\nthe subject of the query event. Once we have obtained the related\nentity set, we can construct the history with the historical events\nwhere the subject or object is within this set. Similarly, through\nthe function of images, the retrieval process also contains key\nevents and complementary events.\n•Unstructured Data. Unlike structured data, we can use the em-\nbedding techniques to directly retrieve relevant news events from\na set of historical news articles for the unstructured data. Follow-\ning this, we filter historical news events based on timestamps,\neliminating outdated and irrelevant events. We also select the key\nevents and complement information based on the images, which\nwill be input according to the prompts described in Section 3.2,\nand finally obtain the prediction results.\n4 Experiments\nWe conduct experiments to evaluate the proposed approach, and\nanswer the following research questions:\n•RQ1: What is the overall performance of temporal event fore-\ncasting methods by including visual information?\n•RQ2: How do the highlighting and complementary functions of\nimages affect the forecasting performance?\n•RQ3: How do different LLM backbones as well as fine-tuning\naffect the performance?\n4.1 Experimental Settings\nWe introduce the experimental settings, including the dataset, the\nmethods compared, and the implementation details.\n4.1.1 Dataset. We build our dataset based on MidEast-TE-mini [4],\nwhich includes structured atomic events and news articles. We\naim to add images that correspond to the events in the dataset,\nhence we will have the data in visual modality. An intuitive way is\nto download the web page according to the URL provided by the\noriginal dataset. However, the original web page always contains\na lot of irrelevant images, such as advertisement images, that are\ncumbersome and difficult to be accurately filtered out. Instead of\ndirectly solving this problem, we propose an alternative solution\nthat we use Google Image Search4 to search the images using the\nnews article title as the query. Among the returned images, we select\nthe top-ranked ones as the associated images of the news article. In\norder to further filter out irrelevant images, we instruct the Gemini-\n1.0-Pro-Vision model to determine the relevance of images to news\narticles. We give three options: highlighting, complementary and\nirrelevant. Highlighting means that the images and the content\nof the news are highly matched, and complementary means that\nthe image has supplementary meaning to the content of the news.\nImages beyond these two are regarded as irrelevant. We further\nremove images that are classified as irrelevant. Finally, we name\nour dataset as MidEast-TE-multimodal, short as MidEast-TE-mm.\n4.1.2 Compared Methods. The compared methods are categorised\ninto non-LLM-based methods and LLM-based methods. For non-\nLLM-based methods, only text or graph modalities are involved,\nsince these methods architecture are fixed. We train the models on\nthe training set, selecting the best-performing model based on the\nvalidation set results, and obtain the final results of the testing set.\nFor LLM-based methods, we use the proprietary LLMs due to their\nsuperior performance compared to open-source LLMs. Therefore,\ntesting is generally done in a zero-shot manner, i.e., directly test\nthem on the testing set. The specific methods are shown below:\n•ConvTransE [36]: This method employs a convolutional neu-\nral network (CNN) and a translational operation to capture the\nrelational patterns within triplet data.\n•RGCN [35]: RGCN leverages a graph convolutional neural net-\nwork (GCN) to capture the diverse relations between entities.\n•RE-GCN [22]: RE-GCN utilizes a combination of GCN and recur-\nrent neural network (RNN) to capture both the relational patterns\nand temporal dynamics.\n•LoGo [ 30]: This method models relationships within and be-\ntween complex events from both local and global perspectives.\n•GPT-3.5-Turbo7: The GPT-3.5-turbo model is the prevalent iter-\nation of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language\nmodel developed by OpenAI5.\n4https://images.google.com/\n5https://openai.com/\nMM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Haoxuan Li et al.\nTable 1: Performance (accuracy) comparison between zero-shot LLM-based methods and the non-LLM methods in both\nsettings of object entity prediction and relation prediction. For LLM-based methods, we include multiple backbones with two\nrepresentative forecasting method, i.e., ICL and RAG. Results of our methods are highlighted with grey backgrounds, where the\nkey novelty lies in we leverage images by the Image Function Identification module.\nModel Type/Backbone Forecasting Model Multimodal Model Object Entity Prediction Relation Prediction\nText Graph Text Graph\nNon-LLM\nConvTransE [36] Uni-modal N/A 0.3737 N/A 0.7327\nRGCN [35] Uni-modal N/A 0.3777 N/A 0.7203\nRE-GCN [22] Uni-modal N/A 0.3879 N/A 0.7333\nLoGo [30] Uni-modal N/A 0.3969 N/A 0.7406\nGemini-1.0-Pro-Vision6 ICL [16] MLLM 6 0.3023 0.3319 0.5541 0.6085\nRAG [17] MLLM 6 0.3305 0.3465 0.5769 0.5848\nGemini-1.0-Pro6\nICL [16] Uni-modal 0.3312 0.3657 0.5900 0.6257\nMM-Forecast (ours) 0.3527 0.3837 0.6087 0.6324\nRAG [17] Uni-modal 0.3340 0.3669 0.6081 0.5866\nMM-Forecast (ours) 0.3425 0.3692 0.6121 0.5991\nGPT-3.5-Turbo7\nICL [16] Uni-modal 0.3063 0.3431 0.4847 0.5345\nMM-Forecast (ours) 0.3414 0.3522 0.5317 0.5521\nRAG [17] Uni-modal 0.3272 0.3397 0.4943 0.4666\nMM-Forecast (ours) 0.3652 0.3647 0.5152 0.5113\n•Gemini-1.06: Gemini-1.0 is a cutting-edge family of multimodal\nmodels developed by the Gemini Team at Google.\n4.1.3 Implementation Details. To ensure the reproducibility, we\nfixed the temperature parameter of the proprietary LLMs used to\n0 and set the seed parameter to a constant value. When making\nforecasting, we limit the maximum output token length to 256 to pre-\nvent invalid responses. To ensure fairness across the experiments,\nthe history that can be retrieved is set to 30 days. Notably, the re-\ntrieval models that we employ include: BM25 [34], Contriever [12],\nand LlamaIndex [26]. Additionally, considering the limitation of\nthe context window, we further restrict the maximum number of\nsub-events in the historical context to 50. Following previous meth-\nods [4], we employ the Accuracy (Acc) as the evaluation metric.\n4.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)\nWe analyze our model’s performance, by comparing various base-\nline methods on different experimental settings, different input\nforms, and different retrieval models.\n4.2.1 Performance w.r.t.Various Settings. The overall performance\ncomparison is presented in the Table 1. To comprehensively ex-\nplore and evaluate methods, we conduct experiments across multi-\nple dimensions, including the format of data representation (Text\nor Graph), the construction of historical information (RAG-based\nor ICL-based), and the prediction objective (Object or Relation).\nClearly, we have the following observations.\n6https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini\n7https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5-turbo\nTable 2: The results of using different retrieval models.\nRetriever Gemini-1.0-Pro GPT-3.5-Turbo\nBM25 [34] 0.3272 0.3318\nContriver [12] 0.3335 0.3431\nLlamaIndex [26] 0.3425 0.3652\nFirst, enhancing LLM-based methods with visual information\nconsistently improves their accuracy across all experimental set-\ntings. This demonstrates that our proposed MM-Forecast makes\neffective use of visual information, leading to a better contextual un-\nderstanding of historical information. Hence, our method strength-\nens the inference ability of LLM and makes more accurate event\nforecasting performance.\nSecond, even though the performances of all LLM-based methods\nhave been improved, they still under-perform the traditional Non-\nLLM based methods. The reason is that LLM-based methods are\ntested in zero-shot manner, while the Non-LLM methods, which\nfollow supervised learning, are still competitive. Notably, by using\nour MM-Forecast method, LLM-based methods can achieve close\nor even better performance than Non-LLM methods for the object\nentity prediction task.\nThird, the relation prediction task exhibits higher accuracy com-\npared to the object entity prediction task. This suggests that the\nforecasting of entities is more challenging than relations. There\nare a few potential reasons for this. First, the set of entities (5909)\nis much larger than the set of relation types (267), so predicting\nspecific entities is inherently more difficult given the larger candi-\ndate pool. Second, we deem that the information implied in entities\nis more explicit. Thus when two entities are given for a relation\nMM-Forecast: A Multimodal Approach to Temporal Event Forecasting with Large Language Models MM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia\n0.23\n0.26\n0.29\n0.32\n0.35\n0.38\nGPT-3.5-Turbo-Object\n0.44\n0.46\n0.48\n0.5\n0.52\n0.54\n0.56\nGPT-3.5-Turbo-Relation\nbaseline (none) complementary highlighting both (ours)\nFigure 3: Ablation study of each type of image functions.\nprediction, it is easier than when the subject and relation are given\nfor an object prediction.\n4.2.2 Performance w.r.t. Directly Using Images. To illustrate the\nlimitations of existing MLLMs in the task of temporal event forecast-\ning, we also conduct experiments using the Gemini-1.0-Pro-Vsion\nmodel [40] and directly consuming the images in the sub-events.\nSpecifically, this approach leverages the inherent image understand-\ning capabilities of the Gemini-1.0-Pro-Vision model, which embeds\nimage patches as features and seamlessly concatenates thes image\nfeatures with textual features. From Table 1, we can observe that the\naccuracy of using images directly is not only lower than our MM-\nForecast, but also even worse than the method using only textual\ndata (Uni-modal methods). This illustrates that existing proprietary\nMLLMs still struggle to make effective event forecasting with mul-\ntiple images, and reflects the superiority of our MM-Forecast.\n4.2.3 Performance w.r.t. Various Retrieval Models. The choice of\nretrieval model may have a significant impact on forecasting. The\nexperiments here involve only unstructured event forecasting, since\nthe structured approach employs retrieval based on keyword search\ntechniques. To explore the effect of retrieval model, we adopt three\ndifferent retrieval models, i.e., BM25 [34], Contriver [12], and LLa-\nmaIndex [26], then equip them into our forecasting framework,\nand obtain the forecasting results. From the results in Table 2, we\ncan observe that the performance progressively improves by us-\ning stronger retrieval models, with LLamaIndex performing the\nbest, followed by Contriver, and then BM25. These results verify\nthat stronger retrieval capabilities lead to better forecasting per-\nformance, suggesting that retrieval-oriented method design is a\npromising direction for future research. This phenomenon is con-\nsistent with the observation concluded from recent works [4].\n4.3 Study of the Image Functions (RQ2)\n4.3.1 Effects of Image Functions. We conduct ablation experiments\nfor the highlighting and complementary function of images. The\nresults are shown in Figure 3. First, the model that leverages both\nthe highlighting of key events and the complementary information\nperforms the best across the experimental settings. In addition,\nthe performance of the model with only key events highlighted is\nsub-optimal. This illustrates the effectiveness of the highlighting\nTable 3: The accuracy of image function identification.\nData-Type GPT-4-Vision Human\nText Graph Text Graph\nHighlighting 0.68 0.68 0.73 0.83\nComplementary 0.88 0.93 0.87 0.86\nTable 4: Result comparison between using our identified and\nrandomly-assigned image functions.\nModel Settings Object Relation\nText Graph Text Graph\nGPT-3.5-Turbo Random 0.3284 0.3394 0.5156 0.5249\nOurs 0.3414 0.3522 0.5317 0.5521\nfunction of images, and it elicit the fact that highlighting and com-\nplementary reinforce each other to achieve even better prediction\nresults. Second, we can observe that in some settings (Text-ICL, Text-\nRAG), the performances of the model with only complementary\ninformation are even worse than the baseline model. The possible\nreason for this is that the offering of complementary information\nalso introduces more noise and therefore leads the degradation\nof performance. Third, the performance of RAG-based method is\nobviously worse than the ICL-based method in the relation predic-\ntion task, meanwhile, such performance gap does not exist in the\nentity prediction task. This is may because that relation prediction\nis easier than object entity prediction, as mentioned in section 4.2.1.\nAs a result, ICL-based historical events may already contain enough\ninformation to make accurate relation prediction, whereas the re-\ntrieval model may not retrieve relevant information instead.\n4.3.2 Analysis of the Image Function Identification. In addition\nto overall forecasting performance analysis, we conduct in-depth\nstudy to directly assess the efficacy of highlighting and comple-\nmentary function. Specifically, we design additional experiments\nat the data level and prompt level to further verify the function\nof images. At the data level, we randomly sample 100 images of\ntwo categories respectively, and then judge the correctness of the\nclassification by the powerful MLLM GPT-4-Vision 8. As shown in\nTable 3, both classification of highlighting and complementary func-\ntions show high accuracy. Furthermore, we can observe that the\naccuracy of highlighting is lower than that of complementary on all\nsettings, which should be due to its more strict definition. The high\naccuracy of image functions in both LLM and human identification\nindicate that the images we used can indeed play the highlighting\nand complementary functions. In addition to direct assessment of\nthe quality of image function identification, we conduct another\nablation study by replacing our identified functions with randomly\nselected sub-events. Looking into the forecasting results in Table 4,\nrandom selection of sub-events leads to a decrease in forecasting\naccuracy, indicating that correct image function identification is\ncrucial to the forecasting.\n8https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4\nMM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Haoxuan Li et al.\nUser:\nResponse:\n[Query]:\n \n[Related events]: …….\n[Options]:    A. xxx  B. xxx  …\nB. xxx\n(Abdel Fattah Al-\nSisi , Makhdoom \nShah Mahmood \nQureshi, 2191)\nBefore Highlighting\nUser:\nResponse:\n[Query]:\n \n[Options]:    A. xxx  B. xxx  …  E. xxx  F.xxx\nA.

The first image\nemphasizes the event of Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s visit\nto Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, highlighting their efforts to strengthen and\ndiversify bilateral relations. This highlighting function leads to a\ncorrect prediction of the event type. The second image provides\nsupplementary information about the meeting between the two\npoliticians, enabling an accurate prediction of the question.\n4.4 Performance on Open-source and\nFine-tuned LLMs (RQ3)\nAll of the above LLM-based forecasting backbones are implemented\nusing proprietary LLMs in the zero-shot manner without any fine-\ntuning. We are interested in how our method performs on open-\nsource LLMs, especially finetuned open-source LLMs. Addressing\nthis intriguing question, we select one of the most popular open-\nsource LLMs, i.e., Vicuna-7b, to replace the forecasting backbone\nLLM in our framework, with both zero-shot manner and fine-tune\nfollowing typical instruction tuning with QLoRA [9]. The results\nof object entity prediction are presented in Table 5, which also in-\ncludes the best results for proprietary LLMs and non-LLM methods.\nWe observe that the zero-shot performance of Vicuna-7B is worse\nthan its corresponding performance on proprietary LLMs, owing to\nthe inherent capacity gap. However, after fine-tuning, Vicuna-7B\nachieves substantial performance gains, not only surpassing the\nproprietary LLMs but also outperforming all the non-LLM methods.\nIn addition to fine-tuning the LLMs on object entity prediction,\nwe also fine-tuning on the relation prediction task, as shown in\nTable 6. In both the text and the graph settings, the relation predic-\ntion results are consistent with the entity prediction,i.e., fine-tuned\nLLMs achieve the best performance. These results demonstrate the\nsignificant potential of fine-tuning LLMs for the temporal event\nforecasting task.\n5 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this paper, we studied an emerging and interesting problem of\nmultimodal temporal event forecasting. We identified two essen-\ntial image functions in the scenario of temporal event forecasting,\ni.e., highlighting and complementary. Then, we introduced MM-\nForecast, a novel framework that leverages visual information to\nTable 5: Performance of fine-tuned LLMs and its comparison\nwith proprietary LLMs and non-LLM methods.\nModel Vicuna-7b LLM Non-LLM\nzero-shot MM-Forecast-text-h 0.2723 0.3527 N/A\nMM-Forecast-graph-h 0.2502 0.3837 N/A\nfine-tune MM-Forecast-text-h 0.4490 N/A N/A\nMM-Forecast-graph-h 0.5480 N/A 0.3969\nTable 6: Performance of FT LLMs on the relation prediction.\nModel Vicuna-7b LLM Non-LLM\nMM-Forecast-text-h 0.7809 0.6087 N/A\nMM-Forecast-graph-h 0.7901 0.6324 0.7406\nenhance temporal event forecasting. By recognizing the highlight-\ning and complementary functions of images and translating them\ninto verbal descriptions, we were able to seamlessly integrate this\nvisual information into LLM-based forecasting models. Ultimately,\nthis enabled the integration of visual information to enhance tem-\nporal event forecasting task.\nLooking ahead, there are numerous avenues for future work to\naddress the key challenges. In particular, we would like to high-\nlight three distinct aspects that warrant further exploration. First,\nmulti-images relationship need to be considered. There are inher-\nent relationships between images in related historical events, and\nthese relationships are also important for event forecasting. Second,\nseeing is believing. Images have significant effects on the event\nforecasting task rather than accuracy improvement, that is credibil-\nity or trustability. Third, our current solution is still a multi-step\npipeline, while devising an end-to-end approach using MLLMs is\nintriguing to explore in the future.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is partially supported by the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China under grant 62220106008, U20B2063 and 62102070.\nThis work is also partially supported by Sichuan Science and Tech-\nnology Program under grant 2023NSFSC1392.

As show in Table 7, the first\nrow is the prompt for image function recognition, which is mainly\nfrom the perspective of the subject background and the specific\nevent to judge the function of the image. The last two rows are the\nprompts of the different functions of the images to achieve their\nrespective functions and transform their information into verbal\ndescriptions. Eventually, the verbal information will be integrated\ninto the LLM-based event forecasting model.\nA.2 Case study: Image Function\nTo further illustrate that our approach does indeed identify truly\nkey events and the required complementary information, we pro-\nvide additional examples. In the first example of the highlighting\nfunction, the image directly depicts Ocasio-Cortez, with the back-\nground appearing to be the Congressional sites, thereby empha-\nsizing the relevant key event. Correspondingly, the key event also\nmentions the relationship between Congress and Ocasio-Cortez.\nConsequently, an accurate prediction is achieved. In the second\nexample of the highlighting function, the key event highlighted\nby the image directly mentions the disqualification of Ali Larijani\nfrom the election, which perfectly aligns with the results that need\nto be predicted and the information provided to present those re-\nsults. For the first example of complementary functions, the image\nprovides information about the signing of a free trade agreement\nbetween Turkey and the United Kingdom. While enhanced trade\nhas the potential to lead to employment and economic growth,\nthe image offers complementary information on the role of labor.\nTherefore, an accurate forecast is achieved. In the second example\nabout the complementary function, the image shows Bernie Sanders\nwho is a democratic progressive socialist like Ocasio-Cortez. They\nshare many commonalities and connections to Congress, which\ncan provide supplementary information to more accurately predict\nthe outcome. Through these examples, the distinct functions of\nhighlighting key events and providing complementary information\nare elucidated, substantiating the effectiveness of our approach in\nleveraging multimodal information for accurate temporal event\nforecasting.\nMM ’24, October 28-November 1, 2024, Melbourne, VIC, Australia Haoxuan Li et al.\nUser:\nResponse:\n[Query]: (Ocasio-Cortez, Demand material aid, 2281)\n[Related events]:\n[Date]1272:\n* New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has made several claims about the economy and other issues that have been disputed by fact-checkers.\n* The Washington Post has disputed her claim that unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs, noting that the number of people working two jobs has remained steady at around 5 percent in recent years.\n* The Post and Politifact have also disputed her claim that ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night, calling it an \"urban legend.\"\n* The Post has also disputed her claim that a recent study found Medicare-for-all would cut health expenditures, noting that the study found the plan would raise government expenditures by $32.6 trillion over 10 \nyears.\n* Ocasio-Cortez has also made questionable statements on how she would pay for her big spending agenda, including claiming that the military received a $700 billion dollar budget increase last year, which Politfact \nhas rated as \"false.\"\n* Ocasio-Cortez has pushed back against the critics, claiming that they shrugged off GOP Sen.
