AI is revolu-\ntionizing spine surgery, enhancing diagnostics, surgical planning, and robotic assistance. \nHowever, as AI continues to evolve, it is essential to distinguish between AI agents and agen-\ntic AI, as they have fundamentally different implications for clinical practice. The term “agen-\ntic AI” derives from the broader concept of artificial general intelligence, representing sys-\ntems capable of autonomy, adaptability, and decision-making beyond predefined rules, dis-\ntinguishing it from today’s task-specific, or “narrow AI, ” applications commonly used in \nmedicine. AI agents are designed for specific tasks such as radiological image analysis, nav-\nigation assistance, and robotic augmentation, operating within predefined rules and requir-\ning human oversight. In contrast, agentic AI represents a new paradigm—systems capable \nof autonomy, real-time decision-making, and self-learning from surgical data. While AI \nagents are actively transforming surgical workflows, agentic AI remains largely experimen-\ntal but holds the potential to redefine the role of the surgeon in spine surgery.\nAI Agents in Spine Surgery: Current Applications\nAI agents have already demonstrated clinically validated benefits across multiple domains \nof spine surgery. Machine learning models have outperformed traditional radiologists in \ndetecting spinal fractures, degenerative changes, and disc herniations.1-3 AI-driven segmen-\ntation tools assist in spinal alignment analysis and surgical planning, reducing the risk of \nintraoperative errors.2 In the realm of surgical navigation, AI-assisted robotic platforms have \nsignificantly improved pedicle screw placement accuracy and reduced radiation exposure \nby minimizing fluoroscopic imaging.2,4,5 Additionally, AI-powered predictive analytics help \nestimate fusion success rates, postoperative recovery, and complication risks, allowing for a \nmore personalized approach to spine surgery.2,6 These AI agents function as assistive tech-\nnologies, enhancing precision and efficiency while ensuring that the surgeon remains in \nfull control.\nNeurospine\neISSN 2586-6591 pISSN 2586-6583 \nThis is an Open Access article distributed under \nthe terms of the Creative Commons Attribution \nNon-Commercial License (https://creativecom-\nmons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits \nunrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, \nand reproduction in any medium, provided the \noriginal work is properly cited.\nCopyright © 2025 by the Korean Spinal \nNeurosurgery Society  \nNeurospine 2025;22(2):473-477.\nhttps://doi.org/10.14245/ns.2550308.154\nEditorial\nCorresponding Author\nWongthawat Liawrungrueang\n https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4491-6569\nDepartment of Orthopaedics, School of \nMedicine, University of Phayao, Phayao, \nThailand\nEmail: mint11871@gmail.com\nReceived: March 9, 2025\nRevised: April 15, 2025\nAccepted: April 17, 2025\n\nAI Agents vs. Agentic AI in Spine SurgeryLiawrungrueang W\nhttps://doi.org/10.14245/ns.2550308.154474 www.e-neurospine.org\nAgentic AI: The Next Frontier in Spine Surgery?\nAgentic AI, on the other hand, represents a future where AI \nsystems possess greater autonomy in decision-making. Unlike \nAI agents, agentic AI could potentially adapt in real-time dur-\ning surgery, modifying the surgical plan based on intraopera-\ntive data. For instance, a deep learning system could continu-\nously analyze biomechanical forces and adjust screw placement \naccordingly, or an AI-powered robotic system could autono-\nmously perform decompression procedures under minimal su-\npervision.2,7,8 For example, envision a future operating room \nwhere an agentic AI-powered robotic system autonomously \nmonitors intraoperative spinal alignment, identifies deviations \nin real time, and adjusts pedicle screw trajectories during defor-\nmity correction—without requiring constant human input. \nSuch capabilities, though currently theoretical, illustrate the po-\ntential paradigm shift toward intelligent surgical autonomy. \nTable 1.

Current U.S. Food and Drug Admin-\nistration and Conformité Européenne regulations mandate hu-\nman oversight in AI-assisted surgical systems, preventing AI \nfrom making autonomous intraoperative decisions.10 Deep learn-\ning models’ “Black-Box” nature further complicates integration, \nas it remains challenging to understand how agentic AI reaches \ncertain decisions fully.5,10 Additionally, medical-legal responsi-\nbility becomes an issue: if an autonomous AI system makes an \nintraoperative decision that leads to complications, who is held \naccountable, the AI developer, the hospital, or the surgeon? Given \nthese concerns, agentic AI is not yet ready for routine clinical \ndeployment, but ongoing research continues to explore its po-\ntential role in spine surgery. We summarize the comparison \nbetween AI agents and agentic AI with their clinical impact in \nTable 1 and provide illustrative figures to depict current and \nemerging technologies (Figs. 1 and 2).\nThe Future: A Hybrid Approach to AI in Spine Surgery\nWhile AI agents and agentic AI represent different stages of \ntechnological advancement, their future in spine surgery is likely \nto be synergistic rather than mutually exclusive.5,11,12 In the short \nterm, AI agents will continue to refine imaging, navigation, and \nrobotic-assisted surgery, serving as decision-support tools that \nimprove surgical accuracy and efficiency.2,5 Meanwhile, elements \nof agentic AI such as real-time adaptability and predictive deci-\nsion-making may gradually be introduced under human super-\nvision. This hybrid approach will enable intelligent augmenta-\ntion without compromising patient safety, professional account-\nability, or clinical ethics. This hybrid approach ensures that AI \nenhances surgical outcomes without compromising safety, eth-\nFig. 1. Current artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted technologies in spine surgery.

The integration of both AI \nagents and agentic AI represents a continuum of innovation, \nwhere evolving technologies can support the surgeon as intelli-\ngent collaborators rather than replacements. The most promis-\ning path forward is one where AI acts as an intelligent collabo-\nrator, augmenting rather than replacing the surgeon. By balanc-\ning innovation with patient safety, integrating AI agents, and \neventually, agentic AI can lead to safer, more precise, and more \npersonalized spine surgery. As technology advances, spine sur-\ngeons must remain at the forefront of AI adoption, ensuring that \nit aligns with clinical needs while upholding the highest stan-\ndards of care.\n• Conflict of Interest: The author has nothing to disclose.\n \nREFERENCES\n1.
