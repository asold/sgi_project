  "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to assessing oxidation behavior of TiAlN coatings with defined stoichiometry on the rake and flank surfaces. This is based on the multi-parametric comparison of the oxidation effects detected on the coatings’ surfaces resulting from static diffusion couple tests. In this experimental study the diffusion couples consisting of Ti-based and Ni-based alloys and coated TiAlN cutting inserts are tested, respectively. The optimum oxidation temperature was determined by annealing the selected TiAlN coating in a high temperature chamber at temperatures: 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C and 1000 °C in air. Concurrently, the mass change and corresponding thickness of the Al2O3 oxidized layer were measured and computed. The comparison of oxides produced covers the surface morphologies, chemical elements and phases which were analyzed by means of SEM (scanning electron microscope), EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy) and XRD (X-ray diffraction techniques). Additionally, scratch tests were performed to assess the penetration depth down to the substrate and coating failure mechanism after oxidation in diffusion couples. An acceptable similarity of Al2O3 films formed on the TiAlN coating surfaces in diffusion couples and machining processes was established.",
