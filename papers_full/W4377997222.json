    "abstract": "A long tradition in eye movement research has focused on three linguistic variables explaining fixation durations during sentence reading: word length, frequency, and predictability. Lengths and frequencies are easily obtainable but predictabilities are tedious to collect, requiring the incremental cloze procedure. Modern large language models are trained using the objective of predicting the next word given previous context, hence they readily provide predictability information. This capability has largely been overlooked in eye movement research. Here we investigate the suitability of a synthetic predictability measure, extracted from pretrained GPT-2 models, as a surrogate for cloze predictability. Using several published eye movement corpora, we find that synthetic and cloze predictabilities are highly correlated, and that their influence on eye movements is qualitatively similar. Similar patterns are obtained when including synthetic predictabilities in data sets lacking cloze predictabilities. In conclusion, synthetic predictabilities can serve as a substitute for empirical cloze predictabilities.",
