  "abstract": "The PointPillars algorithm can detect vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists on the road, and is widely used in the field of environmental awareness in autonomous driving. However, its feature encoding network only uses a minimalist PointNet network for feature extraction of point cloud information, which does not consider the global context information of the point cloud, and the local structure features are not sufficiently extracted, and these feature losses can seriously affect the performance of the object detection network. To address this problem, this paper proposes an improved PointPillars algorithm named TGPP: Transformer-based Global PointPillars. After the point cloud is divided into several pillars, global context features and local structure features are extracted through a multi-head attention mechanism, so that the point cloud after feature coding has global context features and local structure features; the two-dimensional pseudo-image generated by this feature is used for feature learning using a two-dimensional convolutional neural network. Finally, the SSD detection head is used to achieve 3D object detection. It is demonstrated that the TGPP achieves an average accuracy improvement of 2.64% in the KITTI test set.",
