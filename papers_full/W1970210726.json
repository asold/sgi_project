  "abstract": "The model of a piezoelectric transformer (PT), which is more convenient for modeling in comparison with those, which are widely used in practice, is presented in this paper. Moreover, the proposed model can be directly applied in developing radio-electronic equipment and integrated into computer-aided design systems (CAD). The given model of piezoelectric transformer considers not only one but several harmonics and is simple for interactive change of parameters in the modeling process, as well as takes into account and changes the parameters of piezoelectric devices without leaving the basic CAD of radio-electronic equipment. The implementation of this model in the MicroCAP computer-aided design system is shown in the example. The results obtained during modeling are compared with experimental data.",
