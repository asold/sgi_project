Intuduction \nExcimer lamps are equipment designed as light sources \ncapable of radiating high intensity and narrow band uv \nlight or vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lightD ~ . To obtain \nexcimer formation in the lamps in a simple mauner and \nwith great efficiency, dielectric barrier discharges (DBDS) \nin noble gases or a noble gas/halogen mixture are widely \nutitize d, and availability of the light wavelength dep ends \non the kind and composition of working molecules. It is \ncomprehended that particularly xenon ex(imer lanrps, \nwhich provide more powerful VUV radiation at 172 nrn, is \nliable to destroy molecular bonds for ahnost all agents. For \nthis reason, the lamps have been widely used for the \npurpose of industrial application, such as dry cleaning and \nphotochemical vapor deposition in semiconductor \nprocessing, surface modification, and fabrication of oxide \nfilm3). In re~nt years, experimental studies and \ncomputational simulations have been actively perfouned \non the characteristics of the xenon DBD tog:ether with \ngeometry opttmization for electrodes and excitation \nregime for xenon excimer lamps with a view to obtaining \nhigher intcnsity and achieving efflcient operation~)~lD. \nVaiious types of plasma reactors incorporating \npiezoelectric transformers (PT) 12)¥19) have been developed \nin our laboratory. In these reactors, discharges are \ngenerated directly on the PT surface, inducing high \nvoltage caused by the piezoelectric effect. Such plasma \ngeneration methods allow the design of compact plasma \n*Present a~liation: Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, \nlchinoseki National College ofTechnology \nreactors to be accomplished because the PT plays roles of \nboth a high voltage source and a discharge electrode. \nPreviously, a PTbased ozone generator was proposed and \nthe ozone generation characteristics were investigated by \nfeeding the generator with oxygen and airl5). In the case of \noxygen-fed ozone generation, ozone was obtained at a \ncon~ntration of 3.1-20.3 g/Nm3 and maximurn ozone yield \nefiiciency to the extent of 223g/kWh was achievedl9). \nThese values are competitive enough to be compared to \nthe recently reported DBD-type ozone generators \noperated in room temperautcl9). \nAn excimer lamp designed based on the PT has also \nbeen exaJnined to be entrusted to further investigation for \napplication of the plasma reactor. This paper describes the \nexperixnental investigations with a view to detecting VUV \nradiation emitted from the excimer lamp, using a \nphototube combined with an optional glass filter. \nCharacteristics of the VUV radiation are also observed \nwith respect to different types of gas pressure and gap \nlengths to determine the optirnal driving conditions for the \nex(imer lamp . \n2.

The quartz glass \nhas an 80\"/, transmittance at 170 nm. As shown in the \nfigure, the PT and dielectric layer together with the back \nelectrode are fixed by a spacer to be supported at the node \nof the mechanical vibration of the PT. Provided that the \nPT is driven at (1/2)A-mode vibration, a high voltage is \ninduced on the secondary part of the PT. This results in \nthe DBD plasma generation in the gap space as shown in \nthe figure . The ( 1/2)A-mode vibration is de alt with as \ncondition, where a half wavelength of the mechanical \nvibration is equal to the length of the PT. However the \nvibration is subj ect to the primary voltage and discharge \ncurrent to a ~rtain amount of extent. Therefore frequency \nof the prirnary voltage is adjusted arbitral:ily between 26.3 \nand 26.6 kHz. The gap length is adjusted according to \nthickness of the spacer. A secondary voltage appearing at \nthe tip of the PT is measured by an oscilloscope and \npotential divider. Thus discharge power is estinated by a \nLissajous figure formed by the secondary voltage and \nvoltage across the 2-nF capacitor counected between the \nback electrode and the ground. The experimental \narrangement is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). The excimer larnp \nunit depicted in Fig. l(a) is placed in the chamber center. \nAll electrical feedthroughs mounted on the chamber \nflanges. In advance of experixnents, the chamber is \nevacuated to the full extent reaching 10-5 Pa to be filled \nwith a He-Xe (10.8\"/o) mixture in a range from 400 Torr \n(53.3 kP~ to 1000 Torr (133.3 kPa). The radiated VUV is \ndetected using a phototube, whereas the output phototube \nvoltage is recorded using an oscilloscope connected \nthrough a detector drcuit. \n2.2 VUV detection method \nFull expectation is made in this study that the VUV at \n172 nm will be radiated from the Xe2* excimers in the He-\nioo ~ \n~1 _i o \n~K 80 Q~ Ro(~) \nh~: oc e) 60 > o s; Rf (~ )=Ro (~) Tf\\(~) l( = L~ a' I oo = \nE 40 // Tf(X) \n\" \" ~s \n= ~! ~' ' H 20 ~ Xe2' (17~ nm) \n\" ' \no ~l~lo-' \no 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280 300 320 \nwavelength ~ (nm) \nFigure 2 Cathode tadiant sensitivities Ro(~) and R<~) and \ntransmittanoe of optical filter UV-250 T<~) \nXe DBD.

Provided tbat \nradiation of the 172-nm VUV emitted fiom the lamp is \nThe llluminating Engineering Institute of Japan 6 \nJ. Light & Vis. Env. Vol.31, No.1, 2007 \navailable, the light intensity measured by means of the \nfilter in place will become remarkably smalLer than the \nlight intensity measured without utilizing the filter. \nAlthough it may also be possible to detect VUV emission \nat 147 nm brought about by the Xe' resonance Ines by \nmeans of the phototube, the sensitivity at this wavelength \nalmost corresponds to the 20th part of the one at 172 nm. \nBy considerlng, in addition to the above, that the present \nexperiment is perforned under the gas pressure at more \nthan 400 Torr (53.3kPa), most of the resonance emissions \nare absorbed by the ground state atoms2G) 2D. Accordingly \nit can safely be said that the VUV light at 147 nm is \nbelieved to be negligible in this experirnent. \n3. Experirnental results and discussions \n3.1 Vlsible emission from exciner lamp \nFigure 3(a)-(d) shows the images of emissions of visible \nlight obtained at the gas pressure of 760 Torr (101.3 kPa). \nThese images were obtainable by using a single-reflex \ncamera with exposure time of O.5 and F-number of 3.5. \nThe upper side of the images corresponds to the top of the \nsecondary part of the PT. The active emitting region, \nwhich is 30X15 mm, complies with the dischange space \nthat is slightly larger than the area of the secondary part \nof the PT. The expeximents were conducted by allowing \nthe primary voltage Vp to be increased in a range from 20 \nto 45 V. Micro-discharges together with homogeneous \nemissions are observed in a style offilaments between the \ngaps. The DBD was first initiated at the primary voltage \nof 20 V. Secondly by increasing the primary voltage, the \ndischarge regions were extended in a direction of the PT \ncenter (toward the bottom of the images). \ni5 mm \n~~~>1 \n(a)vp=20 V (b) Vp=30 V (c)vp=35 V (d) V,=45 V \n(0.15 W) (o.35 W) (O.4i W) (0.55 W) \nFigure 3 Visible light emission tom tr]e exdmer lamp (Gas pressure: \n760 Torr (i O1 .3 kPa), Gap length: 2 mm) \nAt the primary voltage of 45 V, the DBD appears on the \nentire surface of the secondary part of the PT. From these \nresults, it is understood that application of low voltages of \n15-45 V to the PT makes it possible to operate the excixner \nlamp in the discharge power region ranging from O.15 to \n0.55 W. Thus it becomes possible for the lanrp to work as a \ncompact surfa~ light source. \n3.2 VUV detection using phototube and optical filter \nFigure 4 shows the light intensity detected by the \n7 \n7 \nphototube used as a iuction of discharge power. The open \nand solid circles indicate types of intensity ~6 and Sf \nmeasured by means of and without using the uv-250 \nfilter in pla~, respectively. \nBoth types of light intensity were multiplied as the \ndischarge power was increased, but the light intensity Sf \nmeasured by means of the ~ltcr in pla~ is 250 tixnes \nsmaller than the light intensity S; measured without \nusing the filter. By so doing, it is revealed that 99.6*/, of \nthe radiation emitted by the excimer lamp is absorbed by \nthe filter. It is explained from the above that the VLrv in \nthe wavelength region ranging from 160 to 200 nm is \nradiated from the excimer lamp. Thus it is concluded that \nthe detected \\rUV can be regarded as 172 nm resulted \nfrom radiation from Xe2'. Considering that most of the \nradiation emitted from the lamp is absorbed by the filter, \nthere remains no radiation between 200 and 320 nm. It is \npossible to infer from the results that light intensity \ndetected by means of the filter correspond to those of the \n172-nm VUV \n100 p = 760 Torr (101 .3 kPa) \n~ :) \n~~i O~i Without filter : So \n> ~ co c:(D i O~2 \n~ c: \n~ \n~:o) i 0~3 \n~i With filter : Sf \n10 o o.1 O.2 O 3 04 O 5 O 6 Discharg~ power (W) ' \nFigure 4 Light intensities with respect to discharge power measured \nwith and without opticaf filter in pla~ \n3.3 VUV characteristics of excilner lamp \nThe VUV intensity as a function of the discharge power \nmeasured in the gas pressure region ranging from 400 to \n1000 Torr (53.3-133.3 kPa) is shown in Fig. 5(a). The gap \nlength is maintained at 2 mm. Although the VUV \nintensity generally increases in proportion to heightening \nof the discharge power, the values come to be slightly \nsaturated at higher discharge powers for each region of \nthe gas pressure. Figure 5(b) shows types of VUV \nintensity plotted with respect to gas pressure for discharge \npowers ranging from O.2 to 0.6 W. The VUV intensity in \nthis region is proportional to the gas pressure. These \nresults suggest that in the region ranging from 400 to \n1000 Torr (53.3~133.3 kl)a), the concentration of the \ngenerated Xe2' excimers in the He-Xe DBD bringing about \nthe number of photons at 172 nm is directly proportional \nto the gas density. High-gas pressure conditions enhance \ne~icient excimer formations because the 3-body reaction \nfor the formation, Xe'+Xe+Xe ~> Xe2'+Xe rapidly arises \nprior to the decay process for the Xe' atoms.

Figure 6(a)-(d) show \ntypes of VUV intensity complying with the discharge \npower obtained for gap lengths between 1.0 and 3.0 mm. \nMeasurement was made several times with different \ntypes of pressure. As can be dedu~d from Fig. 5(b), the \nVUV intensity is proportional to the gas pressure. Thus it \nis preferred that the reduced VUV intensity I~,/p a.u.flbrr \nshould be indicated, as the intensity is redu~d to I Torr \n(133.3 Pa) when obtained by dividing I~. by the gas \npressure p. The redu~d VUV intensity I~./p, which is \nindependent of the gas pressure for all gap lengths, \nincreases linearly accompanied with increase of discharge \npower in the case of the gap length less than 2 mm. On a \npoint of 3 mm in gap length, the redu~d intensity seems \nto be saturated at discharge powers of more than 0.4 W. \nDetails of these results, which have not yet been made \nclear, might be explained quantitati'vely in the description \nshown below. \nThe present experiment was conducted not only in the \ngas pressure region ranging from 400 to 1000 Torr (53.3 to \n133.3 kPa) but also at a gap length ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 \ncm. Accordingly the pd product, which is in the right side \nof the Paschen minimum, can be estimated in a region \nranging from 40 to 300 Torr ' cm. In this region, \nheightening of the pd product would lower ionization \ncoefficient a:i/p, and excitation coefiicient a~ /p because of \ndecrease in the reduced electric intensity L7p \ncorresponding to the starting voltage of discharge. In \nthis experixnent, increasing discharge power makes it \npossible to enhance the excitation and ionization, followed \nby the increase in light intensity as a result as depicted in \nFig. 6. However taking into account the fact that the \nsustain voltage in the discharge gap is always constant \nduring the DBD generation even if the applied voltage \n(primary voltage) of the PT increases, the reduced electric \nfield intensity Llp (= V 7(pd )) Iikewise remains constant. \nFor this reason, the increase in the discharge power is \nmainly due to the increase in the discharge curl'ent caused \nby development in the repetition of micro-discharge in the \nDBD. Thus it is hereby conclude d that the saturation \ncharacteristics of the light intensity in Fig. 6(d) is derived \nfrom the temperature increase based on the high current \ndensity. Furthermore a decrease in the excimer forrnation \nis resulted from the above. \n1 \n0.8 \nl~ L L O ~ ~., \n:!
