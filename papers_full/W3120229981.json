Probing Acoustic\nRepresentations for language delivery and its structure\nJui Shah∗\njui.shah@midas.center\nIIIT-Delhi\nYaman Kumar Singla∗\nyamank@iiitd.ac.in\nIIIT-Delhi, Adobe, State University of New York at Buffalo\nChangyou Chen3\nchangyou@buffalo.edu\nState University of New York at Buffalo\nRajiv Ratn Shah\nrajivratn@iiitd.ac.in\nIIIT-Delhi\nABSTRACT\nTransformer models across multiple domains such as natural lan-\nguage processing and speech form an unavoidable part of the tech\nstack of practitioners and researchers alike. Audio transformers that\nexploit representational learning to train on unlabeled speech have\nrecently been used for tasks from speaker verification to discourse-\ncoherence with much success. However, little is known about what\nthese models learn and represent in the high-dimensional vectors.\nIn this paper, we interpret two such recent state-of-the-art models,\nwav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay, on linguistic and acoustic features. We\nprobe each of their layers to understand what it is learning and at\nthe same time, we draw a distinction between the two models. By\ncomparing their performance across a wide variety of settings in-\ncluding native, non-native, read and spontaneous speeches, we also\nshow how much these modeles are able to learn transferable fea-\ntures. Our results show that the models are capable of significantly\ncapturing a wide range of characteristics such as audio, fluency,\nsuprasegmental pronunciation, and even syntactic and semantic\ntext-based characteristics. For each category of characteristics, we\nidentify a learning pattern for each framework and conclude which\nmodel and which layer of that model is better for a specific category\nof feature to choose for feature extraction for downstream tasks.\nKEYWORDS\ninterpretability, probing, pre-trained acoustic representations\n1 INTRODUCTION\nSince the advent of transformers in the computational linguistics\nfield in 2017 [59], they have received great attention for a wide va-\nriety of tasks, ranging from constituency parsing [34] to coherence\nmodelling [49] and sentiment analysis [57]. However, until recently\nthe transformers have been limited to the discrete signal domain.\nSpeech, being in the continuous domain, lags behind.\nAs one of the first models for transformer based speech represen-\ntation, vq-wav2vec [3] proposed a two-stage pipeline. It discretizes\nan input speech to a 𝐾-way quantized embedding space (similar\nto word tokens for NLP tasks). The embeddings are then extracted\nfrom a BERT-based transfomer model. Mockingjay [ 39] and Au-\ndioALBERT [10] are other such transformer models taking mel\nand fbank features as input, respectively. Mel-scale spectrogram as\ninput are a more compendious acoustic feature compared to linear-\nscale spectrogram and fbank features are Mel filter bank coefficients\nwhich give better resolution at low frequencies and less at high\nfrequencies, much like the human ear. Wav2vec2.0 [4] is a recent\ntransformer based speech representation model that converts an\ninput audio to latent space embeddings via a contrastive task.\nThese audio transformers have been applied over many diverse\ndownstream speech language processing tasks with state-of-the-art\nresults, such as speech translation [61], speaker recognition [58],\nautomatic scoring [26], and sentiment classification [57]. This also\nbegs the question as to what these transformer models are able to\nlearn during the pretraining phase that helps them for various eval-\nuation tasks1. Besides, as more and more applications start relying\non such models, it is important to explain what these embeddings\ncapture to check for potential flaws and biases, which can affect a\nlarge number of applications.\nTo this end, different research studies started probing language\nmodel embeddings for particular linguistic properties of interest. In\n[6], Belinkov et al. probed for part-of-speech language understand-\ning, [29] probed for syntax, [50] on morphology, [64] for scales and\nnumbers, etc. However, progress in the audio domain has been very\nlimited with only a few works [1, 7, 51, 52]. Most of these works\ntreat the audio encoders as automatic speech recognition (ASR) sys-\ntems. Because of this restrictive treatment, they probe on a limited\nset of features important for ASR, such as phones, accent and style\n(spontaneous and non-spontaneous). However, the analysis does\nnot explain the state-of-the-art performance that audio encoders\nachieve on a wide variety of tasks.\nOur contributions are summarized as: (1) We introduce here\n(47) probing tasks to capture simple linguistic features of speech\naudios, and we use them to study embeddings generated by two\ndifferent audio transformers on three types of speeches, uncovering\nintriguing properties of encoders.\n(2) We propose a detailed analysis of what is learned by the\nrecent transformer-based semisupervised audio encoder models,\nwav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay. We implement post hoc probing on\nthe embeddings extracted from each intermediate unit of the two\nmodels. We probe these embeddings using an extensive diversity\n(4 high-level categories) and number of features (46 in total), each\ncategorized by the linguistic property they probe. We extract the\nresults on all the features relevant to speech covering both what\nwas spoken and how it was spoken. These results help us lay out\na map of what particular features are learned in each layer while\nalso providing a metric of comparison between the two models.\n1The sentiment of the above inquiry is also conveyed by Prof. Ray Mooney’s quip that\nthe meaning of a whole sentence cannot be captured by a $&!#* vector [12, 42].\narXiv:2101.00387v2  [cs.CL]  12 Jul 2021\nRaw audio\nBlock 1\nBlock 2\nBlock 12\nConv Layer 1\nConv Layer 7\nFeature\n Extractor\nTransformer \nEncoder\nqQuantizer Context\nrepresentations\nContrastive Loss Final\nprojection \nOnly used during training\nEmbeddings\nPost\nprojection\nLayer\nMasking\n(Only\nduring\ntraining)\nFigure 1: wav2vec2.0 Architecture\nThese features are crucial for downstream applications such as auto-\nmatic scoring, readability evaluation, automatic speech generation\nquality, text to speech quality, accent detection, ASR models, etc.\n[5, 33, 37, 54, 63, 66]. As a proof of concept, we also show the ef-\nfect of our analysis on two such downstream applications (speaker\nidentification and phone classification) (§6).\n(2) We test the models for their representative effectiveness on\ndifferent types of speech settings: native-read, native-spontaneous,\nand non-native-read. We find that, for the most part, native-spontaneous\nand non-native speech settings follow the result patterns for native-\nread dataset albeit with a worse performance. In general, type of\nspeakers matter less than the type of speech.\n(3) We identify the role of the feature extractor module in wav2vec2.0,\nwhich enables it to process raw input audio of 16𝐾𝐻𝑧 without any\npreprocessing. We find that the subsequent layers of the feature\nencoder can encode all features into increasingly dense and infor-\nmative representation vectors without any “intelligent processing”\non them.\n(4) We compare the performance of the representations from\naudio models and BERT on text features. This is the first work\nto check the representative capacity of audio representations for\nthe text captured by audio. We find that despite of having no text-\nspecific error metrics, the audio models are able to encode text well\nand are comparable to BERT on several parameters. We find that\nthe dataset used to pre-train audio models has a significant effect\non downstream performance.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards\ninterpreting audio transformer models2. The conclusion points out\nthat the transformers are able to learn a holistic range of features,\nwhich enable them to perform with great accuracy on various\ndownstream tasks even training solely on unlabeled speech.\n2 BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROBED\nMODELS\nWe probe three recent transformer based models: wav2vec2.0, Mock-\ningjay and BERT. Below, we give a brief overview of the three\nmodels and their high-level architectures.\n2We will release our code, datasets and tools used to perform the experiments and\ninferences upon acceptance.\n2.1 wav2vec2.0\nwav2vec2.0 is a recent transformer based speech encoding model. It\nis composed of 3 major components - the feature encoder, the trans-\nformer, and the quantization module. The feature encoder consists\nof a multi-layer convolutional network which converts the raw in-\nput audio input𝑋 to latent representation𝑍1,𝑍2,..,𝑍 𝑡 . These latent\nvectors are fed into the transformer to build the representations\n𝐶1,𝐶2,...𝐶𝑛. The training is done by masking certain time-steps in\nthe latent feature representation and learning a contrastive task\nover it. The contrastive task requires finding the correct quantized\nrepresentation corresponding to the masked latent audio represen-\ntation amongst a set of distractors. The contrastive task targets (𝑞𝑡 )\nare built by passing the output of feature encoder to the quantizater\nat various time steps.\nThe model is pretrained on unlabeled Librispeech data [48] and\nthen finetuned on TIMIT [ 22] dataset for phoneme recognition.\nIt achieves a 1.8/3.3 WER on the clean/noisy test sets on experi-\nments using all labeled data of Librispeech and 5.2/8.6 WER on the\nnoisy/clean test sets of Librispeech using just ten minutes of labeled\ndata. The authors claim that even while lowering the amount of\nlabeled data to one hour, wav2vec2.0 outperforms the previous state\nof the art on the 100 hour subset while using 100 times less labeled\ndata.\nAll our experiments are based on the wav2vec2.0-base model\nin which the feature encoder contains 7 blocks having a tempo-\nral convolution of 512 channels with strides (5,2,2,2,2,2,2)and\nkernel widths (10,3,3,3,3,2,2)respectively and the there are 12\ntransformer blocks with a model dimension of768, inner dimension\n(FFN) 3,072 and 8 attention heads.\nA point to note is that the output of each of the transformer\nblock depends on the duration of the audio file. For a moderate size\naudio (∼5 seconds), the embedding obtained is huge in size. It is\nof the form 768 ∗𝑇 where T is dependent on the duration of the\naudio. Hence, to probe the different features, we time-average the\nembeddings.\n2.2 Mockingjay\nMockingjay is a bidirectional transformer model which allows rep-\nresentation learning by joint conditioning on past and future frames.\n2\nRaw audio\nLog Mel\nfeatures\nMasked\nInput \nPrediction head\nEmbeddings\nPredicted\nFramesL1 loss on\n(Only\nduring\ntraining)\nOnly during training\nBlock 1\nBlock 2\nBlock 12\nTransformer\n Encoder\nFigure 2: Mockingjay Architecture\nIt accepts input as 160 dimension log-Mel spectral features3 and has\noutperformed it for phoneme classification, speaker recognition\nand sentiment discrimination accuracy on a spoken content dataset\nby 35.2%, 28.0% and 6.4% respectively. The authors claim the model\nis capable of improving supervised training in real world scenarios\nwith low resource transcribed speech by presenting that the model\noutperformes other exisiting methods while training on 0.1% of\ntranscribed speech as opposed to their 100%.\nFor our experiments, we use the MelBase-libri model. The archi-\ntecture comprises of 12 encoder layers and each unit has 0he same\noutput dimension of768 and comprises of sub-layers which include\na feed-forward layer of size 3072 and 12 self-attention heads. We\nprobe each of the 12 transformer blocks of both models and the\nfeature encoder of wav2vec2.0 to check if they learn the features of\naudio, fluency, suprasegmental pronunciation and text.\nSimilar to wav2vec2.0, Mockingjay also has huge embeddings of\nsize 768 ∗𝑇 with T dependent on the size of audio.\n2.3 BERT\nBERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations and proved\nto be a major breakthrough for NLP. The architecture basically com-\nprises encoder layers stacked upon eachother. BERT-Base has12\nsuch layers while BERT-Large has 24. We have probed the uncased\nBase model. The input format to the transformer has 3 parts - a\nclassification token(CLS), sequence of words and a separate sen-\ntence(SEP) token. The feed-froward network has 768 hidden units\nand 12 attention heads. BERT achieves effective performance on\nvarious NLP tasks. Similar to audio models, we probe BERT extract-\ning embeddings from each of the 12 encoder blocks. Since, text has\nno time component, the embeddings are of size 768 ∗1.\n3 PROBING - PROBLEM DEFINITION AND\nSETUP\nHere we specify the probing model and explain how we compare\nthe audio and text transformer models. We also give an overview\n3For a primer on log-Mel and other audio feature extraction, refer to [11]\nof all the features and models we probe in the paper along with the\ndatasets used.\n3.1 Probing Model\nWe define the problem of probing a model 𝑀 for a feature 𝑓 as a\nregression task using a probing model𝑃. 𝑃is a 3-layer feed forward\nneural network trained on 𝑀’s emebddings to predict the feature\n𝑓. For instance, in text-transformers, a probing model ( 𝑃) might\nmap BERT embeddings (𝑀) to syntactic features such as parts of\nspeech (𝑓) [32]. Post model training, the representational capacity\nof embeddings is judged based on the ease with which the 3-layer\nfeed-forward probe network is able to learn the said feature. Metrics\nlike accuracy and MSE loss are used for measuring and comparing\nthe representational capacities [1, 6, 7, 32, 51].\nOur probe model consists of a3-layer fully connected neural net-\nwork with the hidden layer having a ReLU activation and dropout\nto avoid over-fitting4. We compare the representative capacity of\ndifferent audio and text transformers on the basis of the loss values\nreported by the prober. Furthermore, we take a randomly initialized\nvector as a baseline to compare against all the ‘intelligent’ models.\nThis approach is in line with some of the previous works in the\nmodel interpretability domain [1, 6, 7, 32, 51]. A diagram explaining\nthe overall process is given in the Figure 3.\n3.2 Feature Overview\nWe test the audio transformer models on the following speech\nfeatures: audio features (§4.1), fluency features (§4.2), and pronun-\nciation features (§4.3). Since spoken language can be considered as\na combination of words (what was spoken), and language delivery\n(how it was spoken), we probe audio transformer models for both\nspeech and text knowledge. For comparing on textual representa-\ntional capacity, we extract text features from the original transcripts\nof all the audio datasets considered (§5). A detailed description of\nall features extracted and their methodology of extraction is given\nin Section 4 (audio features) and Section 5 (text features).\n4Model dimensions are (768, 128, 1)for all the intermediate layers of Transformers\nand (512, 128, 1)for the feature extractor. Adam with a learning rate of0.0001 is\nused.\n3\nTime-averaging\nEmbedding from the transformer (768*T)  \nInput Layer (768)\nHidden Layer (128)\nOutput\n Layer (1)\nEmbedding size -\n768 *1\nMSE Loss\n(Embedding\nas\n input)\nProbing model\nRaw Audio\nof length kT \nwhere \nk = constant\nFeature Extraction\nTransformerBlock 1\nBlock 2\nBlock 12 Predicted\nFeature \nExtracted\nFeature\nFigure 3: Procedure for probing audio transformers\n3.3 Types of Speech Explored\nUnlike text, speech varies drastically across speech types. For in-\nstance, a model developed for American (native) English speakers\nproduces unintelligible results for Chinese (non-native) English\nspeakers [43]. Since transformer models tend to be used across\nmultiple speech types [17, 26], it is important to assess and com-\npare their performance and bias across each of the speech types.\nTherefore, we test them on native read, native spontaneous, and\nnon-native read speech corpora.\nFor probing on native read speech, we use the LibriSpeech dataset\n[48]. We take the default ‘train-clean-100’ set from LibriSpeech for\ntraining the probing model and the ‘test-clean’ set for testing it. For\nnative spontaneous English speech, we use the Mozilla Common\nVoice dataset [2]. We use a subset of 2000 random audios for train-\ning and 200 audios for testing. For interpreting audio transformers\non non-native speech, we use L2-Arctic dataset [67]. We take 500\naudios of 4 speakers each for training the prober and 50 audios\neach for testing. The 4 speakers are selected in such a way that\nthere is 1 male and 1 female speaker each with Hindi and Spanish\nas their first languages.\n3.4 Models Probed\nWe probe two recent audio transformers, wav2vec2.0 and Mocking-\njay for their speech and language representational capacities. For\ntext-based linguistic features particularly, we also compare them\nwith BERT embeddings [16]. See Section 2 for an overview of the\nthree transformer models.\nSelf-attention is the powerhouse which drives these transformers\n[59]. It is the main reason behind their state-of-the-art performance\non diverse tasks. While Mockingjay is exclusively built of self-\nattention and feed-forward layers, wav2vec2.0 also has several\nCNN layers. They are presented as “feature extractor” layers in the\noriginal paper (Figure 1). Therefore, we also investigate the role of\nthe feature extractor in wav2vec2.0. In particular, we investigate\nthat whether similar to computer vision [21, 24, 35], do the CNN\nlayers in speech transformers also learn low-level to high-level\nfeatures in the subsequent layers. Very few studies in the speech\ndomain have tried to answer this question [65].\nWe probe the representational capacity of embeddings from all\nlayers of the three transformer models. This helps us understand the\ntransformer models at four levels, i.e., across models, speech types,\ninput representations (log Mel and raw audio), and layers. This\nanalysis gives us results on a much finer level than just comparing\nthe word error rates of the two models. It helps us to know the\nlinguistic strengths and weaknesses of the models and how they\nare structuring and extracting information from audio. We also use\nour interpretability results to improve the performance on some\ndownstream tasks (§6).\n4 WHAT DO AUDIO TRANSFORMERS HEAR?\nIn this section, we probe audio (§4.1), fluency (§4.2), and pronun-\nciation (§4.3) features. These features are extracted directly from\nthe audio waveform. Amongst them, the audio features measure\nthe knowledge of the core features of audio including energy, jitter,\nshimmer and duration. Fluency features measure the smoothness,\nrate, and effort required in speech production [14, 63]. Pronunci-\nation features measure the intelligibility, accentedness and stress\nfeatures of the audio. Tasks such as automatic scoring, readability\nevaluation, automatic speech generation quality, text to speech\nquality, accent detection, ASR models, etc. are impacted by the\nfluency and pronunciation features [5, 33, 37, 38, 54, 63, 66].\nA typical embedding of the transformers at any layer is of the\nsize 768∗𝑇 where T depends on the duration of the speech segment.\nWe average it to get 768 ∗1 dimension embedding which serves\nas the representation of the speech segment for which we have\nextracted the features. This is then fed as the input to our probing\nmodel. Figure 3 depicts the process.\n4.1 Audio knowledge\nWe measure the following audio features: Total duration, zero-\ncrossing rate, energy entropy, spectral centroid, mean pitch, local\njitter, local shimmer, and voiced to unvoiced ratio . Total duration is\na characteristic feature of the audio length that tells us about the\n4\nFigure 4: Performance of wav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay on fluency features (a1,b1), pronunciation features (a2,b2), surface level text features\n(a3,b3), audio features (a4,b4) (‘W’ denotes wav2vec2.0 and ‘M’ denotes Mockingjay). The graphs represent stacked area charts with the x-axis\nbeing the layers of the model and y-axis shows the relative performance of each layer with respect to the maximum loss for each feature ((loss\n- min_loss)*100%/min_loss). Hence, higher the value, higher the loss, lower the performance.\nThe feature numbers according to category are given below:\nAudio features: 1. total duration, 2. stdev energy, 3. mean pitch, 4. voiced to unvoiced ratio, 5. zero crossing rate, 6. energy entropy, 7. spectral\ncentroid, 8. localJitter, 9. localShimmer ,\nFluency features: 1. filled pause rate, 2. general silence, 3. mean silence, 4. silence abs deviation, 5. SilenceRate1, 6. SilenceRate2, 7. speaking rate,\n8. articulation rate, 9. longpfreq, 10. average syllables in words, 11. wordsyll2, 12. repetition freq ,\nPronunciation features: 1. StressedSyllPercent, 2. StressDistanceSyllMean, 3. StressDistanceMean, 4. vowelPercentage, 5. consonantPercentage, 6.\nvowelDurationSD, 7. consonantDurationSD, 8. syllableDurationSD, 9. vowelSDNorm, 10. consonantSDNorm, 11. syllableSDNorm, 12. vowelPVI-\nNorm, 13. consonantPVINorm, 14. syllablePVINorm , and\nSemantic level text features: 1. Total adjectives, 2. Total adverbs, 3. Total nouns, 4. Total verbs, 5. Total pronoun, 6. Total conjunction, 7. Total\ndeterminers, 8. Number of subjects, 9. Number of objects\ntemporal shape of the audio. The temporal feature zero crossing\nrate measures the rate at which a signal moves from positive to a\nnegative value or vice-versa. It is widely used as a key feature in\nspeech recognition and music information retrieval [47, 56]. Energy\nfeatures of audio are an important component that characterizes\naudio signals. We use energy entropy and the standard deviation\nof energy (std_dev energy ) to evaluate the energy profile of audio.\nSpectral centroid is used to characterise the spectrum by its centre\nof mass. To estimate the quality of speech as perceived by the ear,\nwe measure the mean pitch . We also probe for frequency instability\n(localJitter), amplitude instability (localShimmer), and voiced to un-\nvoiced ratio . Table 1 mentions the libraries and algorithms used for\nextracting the above features. Next we present the results of our\nprobing experiments on the two transformers for three different\nspeech types.\nNative Read Speech: Figures 4(a4,b4)5 shows the results ob-\ntained for audio features probed on wav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay\non the Librispeech dataset. It can be seen that the lowest loss is\nobtained in the initial two layers for wav2vec2.0, whereas it is the\nfinal layer for Mockingjay. These results also indicate that unlike\ncomputer vision there is no uniform conception of “high-level” or\n“low-level” in audio transformers [21, 24, 35]. We can see a clear\nascent in the losses as we traverse the graph for wav2vec2.0 from\nleft to right, i.e., from lower layers to the higher layers. This sug-\ngests that as we go deeper into the 12 block transformer model the\naudio features are diluted by wav2vec2.0. Mockingjay, on the other\nhand, follows a negative slope for its losses from the first to the\nlast layers. Hence, the audio features are best captured in the final\nlayers of the Mockingjay model.\n5Refer Tables 7 and 11 of Appendix for loss values\n5\nAudio feature Description Extracted Using\nTotal duration Duration of audio Librosa [40]\nzero-crossing rate Rate of sign changes PyAudioAnalysis [23]\nenergy entropy Entropy of sub-frame normalized energies PyAudioAnalysis [23]\nspectral centroid Center of gravity of spectrum PyAudioAnalysis [23]\nmean pitch Mean of the pitch of the audio Parselmouth [8, 31]\nlocal jitter Avg. absolute difference between consecutive\nperiods divided by the avg period Parselmouth [8, 31]\nlocal shimmer Avg absolute derence been\nthe amplitudes of consecutive periods, Parselmouth [8, 31]\ndivided by the average amplitude\nvoiced to unvoiced ratio Number of voiced frames upon\nnumber of unvoiced frames Parselmouth [8, 31]\nTable 1: Audio feature extraction algorithms and libraries used\nWhen comparing the minimum losses across both models, the\naverage learning of these features for wav2vec2.0 is better than that\nof Mockingjay by 28.59%. Even with the final layer embedding,\nwav2vec2.0 performs better than Mockingjay by 24.53%. This is\ninteresting given that the final layer of wav2vec2.0 contains the\nmost diluted version of the learned features and Mockingjay has its\nbest version (in the final layers). Therefore, wav2vec2.0 has richer\naudio representations compared to Mockingjay.\nNative Spontaneous Speech: For native spontaneous speech,\nas shown in Figure 56, wav2vec2.0 is observed to perform better\nthan Mockingjay. Wav2vec2.0, on an average performs better by\n41.69% when compared across the best performing layers and\n51.12% when end layer losses are compared. The pattern of the\nbest performing layer also remains the same as the case of native\nread speech for Mockingjay. For wav2vec2.0, native read speech\nwas best captured in the initial2 layers, but for spontaneous speech,\nthe layers are a bit more spread out across the initial half of the\ntransformer model. We also observe that the loss values on native\nspontaneous speech are higher than the ones for native read and\nnon-native read corpora.\nNon-native Speech: When tested on L2 speakers (Figure 5 7),\nwav2vec2.0 outperforms Mockingjay by 9.53% and 12.51% on\nminimum and end layer losses, respectively. Additionally, similar to\nthe case of native read speech, Mockingjay learns the audio features\nbest in the final layers. As for wav2vec2.0, the layers learning the\naudio features are spread out with the initial half of the model\nlearning them more accurately than the later half.\n4.2 Fluency knowledge\nTo the best of our knowledge, we use the features that measure\nfluency for the first time in this paper. The key features of fluency\nare: rate of speech, pauses, and length of runs between pauses [63].\nTo measure the rate of speech, we measure the speech rate (number\nof words per second in the total response duration) (speaking_rate)\n6Refer Tables 23 and 25 of Appendix for loss values\n7Refer Tables 15, 19 of Appendix for loss values\nand articulation rate (number of words per second in the total artic-\nulation time, i.e., the resulting duration after subtracting the time of\nsilences and filled pauses from the total response duration) (articu-\nlation_rate) [60]. Apart from these rates, pauses in speech are the\nsecond most observable feature to indicate disfluency [30]. There-\nfore, we measure the duration, location and frequency of pauses\nas prototypical features. For this, we measure the number of filled\npauses per second - (filled_pause_rate), silence deviation (absolute\ndifference from the mean of silence durations), which along with\nthe total duration of the audio helps to indicate the length of runs\nbetween the pauses [41]. This also serves an important indicator\nfor fluency. Other features include total number of silences (general\nsilence), mean duration of silences (mean_silence), average silence\nper word (SilenceRate1), average silence per second (SilenceRate2)\nand number of long silence per word (longpfreq).\nFurthermore, conversational fillers are a major source of disflu-\nency. Sounds like uh, um, okay, you know, etc are used to bring\nnaturalness and fluency to their speech. The extent of fillers is an\nimportant feature to check for speech fluency. We use the aver-\nage number of syllables in a word (average_syllables_in_word), the\nnumber of words with syllables greater than 2 (wordsyll2) and the\nrepetition frequency (repetition_freq), to measure this.\nNative Read Speech: For fluency based features on native read\nspeech, similar to audio features, wav2vec2.0 performs better than\nMockingjay (Figures 4 (a1) and (b1)8). While the fluency features\nare not layer specific but are spread across the model for Mocking-\njay, they tend to show the best performance in the middle layers\nfor wav2vec2.0. With the final layer embeddings of both models,\nwav2vec2.0 performs better than Mockingjay by 12.23%. The per-\nformance gap increases by four folds to 42.37% when compared\non the minimum losses (among all observed for the intermediate\nlayers) learnt by both models.\nNon-native Speech: For the L2 Arctic dataset (9), the learning of\nfluency features is concentrated in the middle layers for wav2vec2.0.\n8Refer Tables 8 and 12 of Appendix for loss values\n9Refer Tables 16 and 20 of Appendix for loss values\n6\nFigure 5: Performance of each audio feature (on the y-axis) relative to the performance of random embeddings on the three\nspeech types (native read, native spontaneous, and non native speech). X-axis represent the MSE loss values relative to random\nembeddings loss (loss*100/l2_random_loss).\nFluency feature Description\nFilled pause rate Number of filled pauses (uh, um) per second [8, 31]\nGeneral silence Number of silences where silent duration between two words\nis greater than 0.145 seconds\nMean silence Mean duration of silence in seconds\nSilence abs deviation Mean absolute difference of silence durations\nSilence rate 1 Number of silences divided by total number of words\nSilence rate 2 Number of silences divided by total response duration in seconds\nSpeaking rate Number of words per second in total response duration\nArticulation rate Number of words per second in total articulation time (i.e. the resulting\nlength of subtracting the time of silences and filled pauses from the\ntotal response duration).\nLong pfreq Number of long silences per word\nAvg syllables in words Get average count of syllables in words after removing all stop words\nand pause words.\nWord syll2 Number of words with syllables greater than two\nRepetition freq Frequency of repetition by calculating number of repetition\ndivided by total number of words.\nTable 2: Fluency feature extraction algorithms and libraries used for extracting them are numpy, textgrids.\nMoreover, here we see a definite pattern that Mockingjay is learning\nbetter in the final layers compared to the no pattern observed in the\ncase of Librispeech. Overall, wav2vec2.0 outperforms Mockingjay\nby 5.06% on the minimum loss layers but by 105.62% for the\nfinal layers. Thus, wav2vec2.0 heavily outperforms Mockingjay on\nnon-native speech settings.\n4.3 Pronunciation Features\nSimilar to fluency features, we are the first to probe pronunciation\nfeatures in speech. The intelligibility, perceived comprehensibility,\nand accentedness of speech are impacted by phonemic errors [15].\nSegmental pronunciation is judged based on the amount of listener\neffort with lower being the better. Hence, we probe the models for\n7\nFigure 6: Performance of each fluency feature (on the y-axis) relative to the the performance of random embeddings on L2\nArctic data features (loss*100/l2_random_loss) on the x-axis where loss values are that of MSE\nPronunciation feature Description\nStressedSyllPercent Relative frequency of stressed syllables in percent\nStressDistanceSyllMean Mean distance between stressed syllables in syllables\nStressDistanceMean Mean distance between stressed syllables in seconds\nvowelPercentage Percentage of speech that consists of vowels\nconsonantPercentage Percentage of speech that consists of consonants\nvowelDurationSD Standard Deviation of vocalic segments\nconsonantDurationSD Standard Deviation of consonantal segments\nsyllableDurationSD Standard Deviation of syllable segments\nvowelSDNorm Standard Deviation of vowel segments divided by mean\nlength of vowel segments\nconsonantSDNorm Standard Deviation of consonantal segments divided by\nmean length of consonant segments\nsyllableSDNorm Standard Deviation of syllable segments divided by mean\nlength of syllable segments\nvowelPVINorm Raw Pairwise Variability Index for vocalic segments\nconsonantPVINorm Raw Pairwise Variability Index for consonantic segments\nsyllablePVINorm Raw Pairwise Variability Index for syllable segments\nTable 3: Pronunciation feature extraction algorithms and these can extracted easily using the libraries- numpy, textgrids,\noperator, re, itertools and counter.\nthe following pronunciation characteristic features - the percent-\nage, standard deviation, duration and Normalized Pairwise Vari-\nability Index (PVI) for vowels (vowelPercentage, vowelDurationSD,\nvowelSDNorm, vowelIPVINorm), consonants (consontantPercentage,\nconsontantDurationSD, consonantSDNorm, consonantIPVINorm ), and\nsyllables (syllableDurationSD, syllableSDNorm, syllablePVINorm ).\nWe also study the presence of stress with the characteristic features\nof stress syllables distance mean (stressDistanceMean), and stress\ndistance mean (stressDistanceSyllMean).\nNative Read Speech: Figures 4(a2) and (b2)10 show the results\nfor probing pronunciation features on wav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay\n10Refer Tables 9 and 13 of Appendix for the loss values\n8\nFigure 7: Performance of each pronunciation feature (on the y-axis) relative to the the performance of random embeddings\non L2 Arctic data features (loss*100/l2_random_loss) on the x-axis where loss values are that of MSE.\nwith the Librispeech data. These features are learnt best by the last\nlayers in Mockingjay. Wav2vec2.0 learns these features the most in\nthe 6th to 8th layers amongst its 12 layers. Mockingjay performs\nbetter for pronunciation-based features than wav2vec2.0 by 30.4%\nin the final layer embeddings. Comparing the minimum loss layers\nfor both models, the difference is 16.19% in favor of Mockingjay.\nNon-native Speech: Mockingjay follows the same pattern for\nL2 Arctic dataset as for the Librispeech dataset. It learns these\nfeatures better in the last layers. However, for wav2vec2.0, the layers\nlearning each of these pronunciation features are more spread out\nacross the initial layers of the second half of the model. Wav2vec2.0\noutperforms Mockingjay but the differences here are reduced to\n8.9% in the end layer and 2.20% in the best performing layer. This\npattern follows the non-native speech performance of wav2vec2.0\nand Mockingjay seen with audio and fluency features. Here too,\nthe performance difference between wav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay\nwidens when compared to the native speech scenario.\n4.4 Feature Extractor Module of wav2vec2.0\nAs shown in Figure 1, wav2vec2.0 has 7 convolutional layers before\nthe transformer encoder block. The authors call it the “feature ex-\ntractor” of wav2vec2.0. While in the computer vision community, it\nhas been shown that subsequent layers of a CNN architecture look\nfor higher level features, in the speech community this question\nhas largely been left unaddressed [21, 25]. We find that there is a\nuniform increase in performance of the subsequent CNN layers for\nall feature types (audio, fluency, and pronunciation) and there is\nno difference between any features with respect to “high-level” or\n“low-level”. Figure 8 shows this behavior for audio features(which\nare supposed to be best learnt by feature extractor of audio trans-\nformer). The CNN layers faithfully extract all the features and show\nminimum loss at the seventh layer or the post-projection layers.\n5 CAN AUDIO MODELS READ TOO?\nSpeech combines the text and the audio parts of the language. Con-\nventionally, the audio community (which also deals with speech)\nhas been more involved with signal sciences while the NLP com-\nmunity has dealt with the text part of speech while ignoring audio.\nThis approach is suboptimal. However, due to the impressive per-\nformance of self-supervised transformers in every domain, there is\na newfound interest in learning task-independent representations.\nConcurrently, there is also an interest in learning how these rep-\nresentations are working. Therefore, we probe to check whether\nthe self-supervised audio transformers on account of their self-\nsupervision tasks have accumulated some knowledge present in\nthe text as well. With this motivation, we probe the audio trans-\nformer representations for surface (§5.1), syntax (§5.3) and semantic\n(§5.2) knowledge. For reference, we compare them with BERT based\ntext-only embeddings. We use random embeddings as baseline. We\ndo the experiments for four speech types (native read, native spon-\ntaneous, non-native, and artificial speech).\nWhile the surface features measure the non-linguistic surface\nknowledge of the encoders, syntax features measure the syntax\nbased linguistic properties. Conneau et al. [12] include features\nsuch as sentence length and word content in surface features and\nsyntax tree depth in syntax feature. The other category of features\nwe measure are semantics features in which we include number of\nobjects and subjects [12].\n5.1 Surface Level Features\nSurface level features measure the surface properties of sentences.\nNo linguistic knowledge is required for these features. They can be\nmeasured by just looking at the tokens [12]. We include the follow-\ning features - unique word count and the average word complexity\n(Word Complexity) since the lexical diversity of spoken speech is\nan important metric to evaluate its quality [55].\nNative Read Speech : When compared on LibriSpeech, surface-\nbased features are learnt better by Mockingjay than wav2vec2.0\n9\nFigure 8: Performance of audio features on the various layers of Feature Extractor\nText feature Description\nSurface Features\nUnique word count Total count of unique words(Ignore words of length 3 or smaller)\nWord Complexity Sum of word complexities for all words in text given by annotators\nSemantic Features\nTotal adjectives Total count of adjectives\nTotal adverbs Total count of adverbs\nTotal nouns Total count of nouns\nTotal verbs Total count of verbs\nTotal pronouns Total count of pronouns\nTotal conjunction Total count of conjunction\nTotal conjunction Total count of conjunction\nNumber of subject Total count of subject\nNumber of Object Total count of direct objects\nTense Classification of main clause verb into present or past tense\nSyntax Feature\nDepth of syntax tree Depth of syntax tree of the text\nTable 4: Text feature extraction algorithms extracted using nltk and numpy libraries\nby 9.99% and (b3)11. These features are learnt best in the interme-\ndiate layers in wav2vec2.0 and initial layers in Mockingjay. From\nthe results, we observe that the text understanding of both models\nbecomes increasingly diffused as we go towards the later layers.\nHowever, wav2vec2.0 outperforms Mockingjay by 3.01% in the\n11Refer Tables ?? and 14 of Appendix for the loss values\nfinal layer. A contributing factor to these observations is the learn-\ning of surface features by Mockingjay in the initial layers while,\nwav2vec2.0 learns it best in the middle layers.\nNon-native Speech: For L2 arctic data, again wav2vec2.0 best\nlearns the surface features in the middle layers but for mockingjay,\nno particular pattern is observed. The difference widens to 38.41%\non the end layers and 18.96% on the minimum loss layer in favour\nof wav2vec2.0.\n10\nNative Spontaneous Speech :Mockingjay learns best in the\ninitial layers like in the case with native read speech meanwhile,\nwav2vec2.0 performs best in the lower middle(7-11) layers. The\ndifference increases to 141.42% for native spontaneous speech on\nthe final layer and 132.44% on the best performing layer.\n5.2 Semantic Level Features\nThe relationship between the words spoken and our comprehension\nof that spoken content falls into the domain of semantics. To pro-\nduce meaning in a sentence, it is almost necessary for it to have a\nsubject and a direct object that the subject addresses. Thenumber of\nsubjects, number of direct objects and total nouns, pronouns, adverbs,\nadjectives, verbs, conjunction, and determiners are hence in our set\nof features to evaluate the spoken content. [12, 32]. We also probe\nfor the tense(past or present) and it is framed as a classification task\nunlike the rest which are regression tasks so the result for tense\nare separately mentioned.\nNative Read Speech : wav2vec2.0 performs better in this set-\nting by 4.173% and 5.29% on the minimum loss layer. Like the\nsurface features, the pattern followed by the layers in learning is\nsame for semantic features. Mockingjay learns them best in initial\nlayers while wav2vec2.0 in the intermediate layers. For tense too,\nwav2vec2.0 best performs with 75.04% accuracy in the seventh\nlayer where Mockingjay performs with 56.99% in the last layer.\nNon-native Speech:The same pattern as surface features in the\nnon-native setting is followed by both the transformers. Mockingjay\ndoes not follow a clear pattern but wav2vec2.0 performs best in the\nmiddle layers. While wav2vec2.0 outperforms Mockingjay be7.36%\non minimum layer loss for L2 speech, the margin decreases to3.26%\non the end layer. Accuracy for tense is 57.95% for wav2vec2.0 and\n52.27% for Mockingjay on 5th and 9th layer respectively.\nNative Spontaneous Speech:Mockingjay does not concentrate\nits learning in any particular layer but wav2vec2.0 performs best in\nthe second half of the transformer layers. wav2vec2.0 performs bet-\nter by 9.83% for native spontaneous speech on the best performing\nlayer and 8.06% on the final layer. Again for tense, the accuracy is\n65.79% on wav2vec2.0 and 57.89% on Mockingjay.\n5.3 Syntax Level Features\nSyntax is the key component of the grammatical structure of a\nsentence, which in turn is a key component of the communicative\ncompetence [9]. We use thedepth of the syntax tree constructed from\nthe sentences spoken in each sound clip as a feature to evaluate the\nsyntax content [12, 32, 36].\nNative Read Speech :In this setting as well, Mockingjay per-\nforms better than wav2vec2.0 by 38.64% on the best performing\nlayer and by 21.5% on the final layer. The final layer captures this\nfeature best for wav2vec2.0 and the initial for Mockingjay, which\nexplains the decrease in percentage difference for the final layer.\nNon-native Speech: wav2vec2.0 performs better on minimum\nlayer loss by 15.89% and 30.92% on the final layer. wav2vec2.0\nlearns best on eight layer and Mockingjay learns best on fourth\nlayer.\nNative Spontaneous Speech :\n5.4 Feature Extractor Module of wav2vec2.0\nThe pattern observed in the feature extractor module for these\nsurface level features is the same as that of audio features with\nminimum losses seen in the post projection layer. However, the\nvalue of the minimum loss in this layer is less than that of the\ntransformer module in wav2vec2.0. This gives some intuition for\nthe better performance of Mockingjay since the Transformer is\nunable to capture the features or unlearns the presented vocabulary\nfeatures.\n5.5 Comparison with BERT\nWhen we compare the performance of audio-transformer models\nwith BERT (Table 5) on the native read speech, we observe that\non an average, both wav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay perform better\nthan BERT by 43.62% and 41.78% on semantic features, 56.90% and\n73.57% on syntactic features and 59.53% and 52.20% on semantic\nfeatures respectively. These results are surprising since none of\nthe speech transformer models was trained with text objective\nfunctions. We hypothesize that this could be due to differences in\nthe train set of the three models. LibriSpeech is the train-set for\nboth the speech-transformer models where as Wikipedia is the\ntrain-set for BERT. To confirm this, we test the performance of\nthe three models on text features extracted from Wikipedia and\nnative spontaneous speech datasets. These datasets provide us with\na comprehensive comparison. While on one hand, Wikipedia is the\ntrain-set for BERT, and the text features from Wikipedia articles\nare very different from LibriSpeech, on the other, non-native read\nspeech dataset can be considered out-of-domain for both the speech\ntransformer models and BERT.\nFor the first part, we convert 2000 random sentences from Wikipedia\narticles to speech by using Google’s text-to-speech API [ 19]. We\nmade sure that the audios constructed had similar lengths as those\nof LibriSpeech. The audios obtained were then passed through both\nthe speech Transformer models and the layers were then probed. On\nthis synthetic dataset, for the semantic features, BERT outperforms\nboth the models by more than 10% when compared on minimum\nloss across all the layers. However, by the end layers, both the mod-\nels learn the features well and the performance difference between\nBERT and audio-transformer models reduces greatly (2.29% and\n0.49% difference for semantic features, 3.83% and 7.68% for syn-\ntax and 7.58% and 21.90% for surface features). These results are\nmotivating since this means that embeddings of audio Transformer\ncaptures not only audio, fluency and pronunciation features, but\nalso textual features to a large extent.\nNext, we use the CMU L2 Arctic dataset. Table 5 presents the\nresults for all the experiments. Here the results are the most differ-\nent from the previous ones. For the semantic, syntax and surface\nfeatures, BERT outperforms both the models by more than 15%.\nThis result when compared with Wikipedia TTS and native read\nspeech implies that the audio models capture text features for native\nspeakers in ‘cleaner settings’ but they are not able to work in not-so\ncontrolled environments. Therefore, in a general setting, BERT text\nembeddings combined with audio embeddings can capture all the\nspeech features adequately.\n11\nFigure 9: Performance of each semantic level feature (on the y-axis) relative to the the performance of random embeddings\non L2 Arctic data features (loss*100/l2_random_loss) on the x-axis where loss values are that of MSE.\nDataset Model Semantic Syntax Surface\nNative Read Speech wav2vec2.0 -43.62%, -40.23% -56.90%, -67.15% -59.53%, -51.31%\nMockingjay -41.78%, -39.55% -73.57%, -74.21% -52.20%, -47.99%\nNon-native Read Speech wav2vec2.0 15.88%, 7.35% 59.05%, 30.33% 78.27%, -3.94%\nMockingjay 24.30%, 11.14% 79.72%, 33.97% 121.71%, 21.30%\nWikipedia TTS wav2vec2.0 10.22%, -2.29% -34.55%, 3.83% 17.70%, -7.58%\nMockingjay 13.87%, -0.49% -47.70%, 7.68% 4.04%, 21.90%\nTable 5: Table for comparison of the performance of BERT with wav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay on text features.

The values shown are an average across all features of a particular category with the relative performance calculated as\n(𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 _𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 −𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑡 _𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 )∗ 100%/𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑡 _𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 .\n6 EFFECT ON DOWNSTREAM TASKS\nWe wanted to evaluate our findings which show that different\nlayers of the models capture different features and see its impact on\ndownstream tasks. To this end, we perform two representative tasks:\nspeaker recognition on Voxceleb [46] (which uses audio features\nprimarily), and phone classification on LibriSpeech (which uses\npronunciation features).\nFor speaker recognition, we randomly pick 10 speakers with\n50 audios each in the train-set and 10 in the test-set. For phone\nclassification, we use the libri-clean-100 and libri-cleanTest splits.\nWe build a 4-layer linear classifier with dimensions756,512,256,10\nwith Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.01. Hidden layers\nhave ReLU activation function and the third layer also has dropout.\nWe perform the tasks using the best performing, final, and weighted\naverage of all layer embeddings of the transformer models as input.\nResults for both the tasks are given in Table 6. The results are\nconsistent with those found for audio (§4.1) and pronunciation\nfeatures (§4.3).\n7 OTHER RELATED WORK\nWe already covered closely related work on attribution in Sections 1\nand 2. We mention other related work.\nBest Last Wtd Avg\nwav2vec2.0 91%/81% 31%/70% 87%/77%\nMockingjay 10%/83% 32%/83% 26%/79%\nTable 6: Comparison of the performance of wav2vec2.0 and Mock-\ningjay on (speaker recognition/phone classification) tasks. Here\nbest denotes best performing layer, i.e., first for audio features and\nsixth for pronunciation for wav2vec2.0.\nAudio Probing: In the domain of speech processing, probes\nhave been carried out on feature vectors, neural networks like\nRNN or DNN, end-to-end ASR systems or Audio-visual models.\nIn [52], probing on x-vectors which are trained solely to predict\nthe speaker label revealed they also contain incidental information\nabout the transcription, channel, or meta-information about the\nutterance. Probing the Music Information Retrieval(MIR) prediction\nthrough Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME)\nby using AudioLIME [28] helped interpret MIR for the first time.\n[44] analyses a DNN for phoneme recognition, both at single node\nand poplation level. Further research on interpretation of the role\nof non-linear activation of the nodes of a sigmoid DNN built for\nphoneme recognition task is done in [45]. Research has also been\ndone to address why LSTMs work well as a sequence model for\n12\nstatistical parametric speech synthesis [62]. Several other studies\nhave been conducted to interpret the correlation between audio and\nimage structures for audio-visual tasks [1, 18, 27]. Even for Deep\nASR models, efforts have been made to comprehend the hidden and\nlearned representations [7, 20]. However, probing of representation\nlearning audio transformers is yet unexplored.\nText Probing: The field of natural language processing has seen\nnumerous efforts in understanding the inner working of large-scale\ntransformers, especially BERT [13, 32, 53]. Jawahar et al. [32] probe\neach of the different layers of BERT to find which layers best learn\nthe phrase-level information, linguistic information and the long-\ndistance dependencies. The results showed what role each layer\nplayed and the study concluded that the middle layers learnt the\nsyntactic features and the higher levels learnt the semantic features\nand that the deeper layers are needed for long-distance dependen-\ncies while the initial layers capture the phrase-level information.\n8 CONCLUSION\nSpeech transformer models, while still being new, have shown\nstate-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. We\nprobe two such models, wav2vec2.0 and Mockingjay, to understand\nwhat they learn. We probe the models on a wide range of features\nincluding audio, fluency, suprasegmental pronunciation, and text-\nbased characteristics. For each category of features, we identify\na learning pattern over each model and its layers. We find that\nwav2vec2.0 outperforms Mockingjay on audio and fluency features\nbut underperforms on pronunciation features. Furthermore, we\ncompare BERT with the audio models with text features and find\nthat the audio models surprisingly outperform BERT in cleaner,\ncontrolled settings of native speech, but are not able to perform in\nan uncontrolled environment such as of spontaneous speech and\nnon-native speech.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nTo Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Afra Alishahi, Marie Barking, and Grzegorz Chrupała. 2017.
