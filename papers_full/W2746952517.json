  "full_text": "INTRODUCTION\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) \ndescribes physical activity (PA) as any bodily \nmovement produced by skeletal muscles \nthat requires energy expenditure.\n1 Exercise \nis a subgroup of PA where the activity is \nplanned, structured, repetitive, and aims \nto improve or maintain one or more \ncomponents of physical fitness.\n1\nIn 2011, the UK Chief Medical Officers \n(CMOs), as the statutory medical advisors to \ngovernment, issued age-specific guidelines \non PA for the general population.\n2 Around \none in two females and a third of males in \nEngland are not achieving the targets of \nthese guidelines, and are damaging their \nhealth as a result. More than one in four \nfemales and one in five males are classified \nas ‘inactive’ by doing less than 30 minutes of \nPA per week.\n3,4 Physical inactivity is among \nthe top 10 risk factors for disease and \ndisability in England.5 It is an unsustainable \nsituation, and is costing the UK an estimated \n£7.4 billion a year, including £0.9 billion of \npreventable costs to the NHS.\n6,7 \nThe UK guidelines are based on WHO \nstandards, which have been adopted by \nmost Western countries. International \ncomparison suggests that UK citizens aged \n≥15 years are more likely to be inactive \nthan their counterparts in most comparable \ncountries in the world;\n8 63.3% of people \nin the UK fail to achieve a benchmark of \nactivity, compared with 40.5% in the US, \n37.9% in Australia, 32.5% in France, 28% in \nGermany, and 18.2% in Holland.\n8 \nThe UK guidelines are incorporated \nwithin clinical guidelines, including the \n2013 National Institute for Health and \nCare Excellence (NICE) guidelines for \nbrief PA advice, which recommends using \nthe General Practice Physical Activity \nQuestionnaire (GPPAQ) to identify those who \nare not meeting the guidelines and who \nshould therefore receive the intervention.\n9 \nGPPAQ is a brief measure of PA in patients \naged 16–74 years that is designed to take less \nthan a minute to complete, and can either be \ncompleted by the patient themselves, or with \nthe assistance of a healthcare professional.\n10 \nPatients are classed as inactive, moderately \ninactive, moderately active, and active. Those \nwho rate less than active are deemed not to \nmeet the national guidelines and so should \nreceive an intervention from a healthcare \nprofessional. GPPAQ was integrated across \nGP clinical information technology (IT) \nsystems in England to support primary \ncare staff using a validated tool to assess \nPA and promote behaviour change. It also \nforms part of the routine tools used in the \nNHS Health Check interview in England, \nwhich is primarily undertaken by other \nhealthcare professionals, rather than by GPs \nthemselves.\n11\nOne in four people say they would be \nmore active if advised by a GP or nurse.12 \nHealth professional-led PA interventions are \nvery effective, with brief advice for PA having \na number needed to treat of 12, up to 10 \nResearch\nAbstract\nBackground\nPhysical activity (PA) brief advice in health care \nis effective at getting individuals active.

These papers \nare low powered, with small sample sizes \n(n = 14 231 and n = 177, respectively) and \nare only regionally based.22–24\nThe aim of this study was to assess \nknowledge, use, and confidence in PA \nguidelines and PA assessment tools by GPs. \nThe specific objectives of this study were:\n• to measure overall awareness of the \nnational guidelines by GPs;\n• to identify awareness by GPs of the tools \navailable to support the guidelines;\n• to measure understanding of GPs on how \nto use the tools;\n• to assess how many GPs have undertaken \ntraining on the use of tools and \ninterventions; \n• to measure GPs’ confidence in raising the \nissue of PA in consultations; and\n• to identify whether, and with whom, GPs \nraise the issue of PA.\nMETHOD\nStudy design\nThe questionnaire-based study was \ncommissioned by Public Health England \n(PHE).\n25 Questions were compiled by an \nadvisory panel including academics, \npolicymakers, GPs with a special interest, \nand internal experts in PA and general \npractice. Questionnaire design, scripting, \nand quality assurance were conducted by \nPHE. Collection and processing of data were \ncarried out by MedeConnect Healthcare \nInsight (MHI), the market research division \nof the Doctors.net.uk (DNUK) group.\n26 \nThe study was conducted between \n16 March and 26  March 2016. The \nquestionnaire was available at any time \nduring this time period from any computer. \nThe questionnaire had a multiple-choice \nquestion (MCQ) format, where one or more \nanswers could be provided to each of six \nquestions (Box 1).\nIndividuals were given the option to leave \nmore detailed comments for each question. \nAnswers were automatically saved, which \nmeant the questionnaire was not required to \nbe completed in one sitting. Demographics \nalso had to be provided.\nThe survey was live on the DNUK website, \nwith an invitation placed on the homepage \nof all GPs who visited the website during the \nstudy period. Participation was by choice of \nthe individual.\nHow this fits in\nAdvice from a healthcare practitioner has \nbeen effective at getting individuals active, \nbut many GPs do not discuss physical activity \n(PA) with their patients. This study found \nthe majority of GPs (80%) are unfamiliar \nwith the national PA guidelines. Use of tools \nto assess patient PA, such as the General \nPractice Physical Activity Questionnaire\n \n(GPPAQ), are within clinical guidelines and, \nthough the majority of GPs are aware of \nthem (70%), most do not understand or use \nthem in practice, and are unconfident in \nraising the subject with patients. Knowledge \nof the guidelines increased the likelihood \nthat a GP would know about the tools, use \nthem, and raise the issue of PA with patients \nwhose conditions could benefit. Provision of \ntraining on PA for GPs could increase patient \nbehaviour change, resulting in improved \nclinical outcomes, as well as disease \nprevention. Box 1. Six questions from the \nstudy questionnaire\n1.  How familiar or unfamiliar are you with the \nChief Medical Officers’ physical activity (PA) \nguidelines?\n2.  Which, if any, of the following tools are you \naware of to help assess patient PA? And \nwhich do you use?\n3.  How well do you feel you understand how to \nuse these tools in day-to-day practice?\n4.  Which, if any, of the following training \nsessions have you undertaken with respect \nto encouraging PA?\n5.  How confident or unconfident would you \ndescribe yourself in terms of raising PA with \nyour patients?\n6.  For patients with which of the following \nconditions would you discuss and \nrecommend PA to?\nBritish Journal of General Practice, October 2017  e669\nQuotas were used to ensure good regional \nrepresentation and to mitigate regional \nvariation in local initiatives. Quotas were \nbased on the last workforce data showing \ngeographical distribution of GPs through \nstrategic health authorities. Once a quota \nwas completed it was closed, so that no \nmore GPs from that area could begin the \nsurvey. All GPs who were already in the \nprocess of completing the survey were \nallowed to finish it, and were included in the \nfinal sample.\nThe survey aimed to reach a minimum \nsample size of around 1000 GPs to allow \nenough power in the study for analysis. A \nfinancial incentive was offered to encourage \nindividuals to take part in the survey. \nResponders were only able to complete the \nquestionnaire once, as the DNUK system \nonly allowed a particular user to interact \nwith the survey once.\nInclusion criteria\nResponders were drawn from the DNUK \ncommunity of General Medical Council \n(GMC)-registered doctors. Membership of \nDNUK required a GMC registration number, \nwhere members were matched to the \nmonthly GMC register. Only GP partners, \nsalaried GPs, GP registrars, and locum GPs \nwho were based in England were invited to \nparticipate. \nExclusion criteria\nDoctors in Scotland, Wales, and Northern \nIreland were ineligible. Those who did not \nfully complete the questionnaire or answered \na question that contradicted the inclusion \ncriteria were excluded. When a regional \nquota was reached, no further responders \nfrom that region could participate. Non-\ndoctors, and doctors who were neither GPs \nnor GP registrars, were ineligible.\nData analysis\nData from each of the six MCQs were cross-\nmatched against each other and also with \nthe demographics to allow identification \nof any correlations. The \nt-test and 95% \nconfidence intervals (CIs) were used \nto assess whether differences in results \nbetween the different demographic groups \nwere significant.\nRESULTS\nSample demographics\nDuring the period when the study took place, \nthe total GP membership giving a working \naddress in England was 47 761. Of these, \n11 654 GPs visited the DNUK website on \nat least a weekly basis. A total of 1415 GPs \naccepted the invitation to take part in the \nsurvey. Of these, 289 were excluded for not \nfully completing the questionnaire. A further \n46 were then excluded for either providing \ncontradictory answers in the survey (for \nexample, reporting that they were both \nfamiliar and unfamiliar with guidelines), or if \ntheir answers indicated that they no longer \nmet the criteria for inclusion, and 67 were \nunable to take part as their regional quota \nhad already been met. The final analysis \nincluded 1013 responses. \nMost responders were male (57%, \nn = 581), GP partners (61%, n = 620), aged \nbetween 30 and 39 years (36%, n = 369), \nworking in a practice with six GPs (range \n1–30), had a patient population of 8994 \n(range 500 to 40 000), based in London \n(12%, \nn = 120), in an urban area (42%, \nn = 429), did not take an active part in their \nclinical commissioning groups (CCGs) (61%, \n30%\n29%\n22%\n19%\n1%\nNot heard of it\nHeard of it but very unfamiliar\nHeard of it but mainly unfamiliar\nBroadly familiar\nVery familiar\nFigure 1.

The mean year of \nqualification from medical school was 1995 \n(range 1968 to 2010).\nOverall awareness of the national \nguidelines\nOf the GPs who responded, 20% (\nn = 198) \nwere broadly or very familiar with the \nnational PA guidelines (Figure 1), whereas \n30% (\nn = 301) had not heard of the guidelines, \nand 51% (n = 514) said that they had heard of \nthem but were broadly unfamiliar or very \nunfamiliar with their content. The survey \nasked specifically about the guidelines, \nrather than guidance that referenced them \n(for example, NICE guidelines), in order \nto understand the knowledge confidence \naround the age-specific recommendations \nfor PA.\nAwareness of the tools available to \nsupport the guidelines\nIn all, 70% (\nn = 705) of GPs were aware of the \nGPPAQ, but 26% (n = 266) were not familiar \nwith any tools at all (Figure 2). There was a \nstatistically significant difference (P = 0.03) \nin knowledge of tools between those who \nwere aware of the national guidelines and \nthose who were not. Although 40% (\nn = 401) \nreported that they actually used GPPAQ in \ntheir clinical practice, 55% (n = 560) said \nthat they did not use any tools at all. The \npercentage of GPs who were aware of \nand using GPPAQ was statistically higher \n(\nP = 0.04) among GPs who also said that they \nwere familiar with the national guidelines. \nConversely, those who were not aware of the \nCMO guidelines were also less likely to know \nabout or use any tools (\nP = 0.04).\nUnderstanding how to use PA tools\nIn general, 41% (\nn = 406) of GPs had a \nmoderate or high level of understanding of \nPA measuring tools, but only 8% (\nn = 84) \nhad a high level of understanding on how \nto implement GPPAQ specifically (Figure \n3). Those who were more familiar with the \nnational guidelines were more likely to \nhave greater understanding and be more \nconfident in discussing PA with patients.\nConfidence in raising the issue of PA in \nconsultations\nIn all, 43% (\nn = 439) of GPs were somewhat \nconfident in raising the issue of PA with \na patient, whereas 16% (\nn = 165) were \neither somewhat or very unconfident. \nUnsurprisingly, almost double the \nproportion of doctors in the group who were \nnot familiar with the guidelines reported \nbeing unconfident when raising the issue \nwith patients, compared with those in the \ngroup who were familiar.\nTraining on the use of tools and \ninterventions to support increased PA\nA total of 55% (\nn = 555) of GPs reported that \nthey had not undertaken any training with \nrespect to encouraging PA. Of those who \nhad received some training, 20% (n = 202) \nwere trained in use of the GPPAQ, and \n18% (\nn = 180) had received training on how \nto deliver brief interventions to encourage \npatient PA.\nGroups of GPs who advise different \ncohorts of patients on PA\nIn terms of specific comorbidities, 15% \n705\n142\n102 119\n74\n20\n266\n401\n32 21\n55\n9 7\n560\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\nGeneral \nPractice\nPhysical\nActivity\nQuestionnaire\n(GP PAQ)\nInternational\nPhysical\nActivity\nQuestionnaire\n(IPAQ)\nSingle-item\nmeasure for\nphysical\nactivity\nScottish\nPhysical\nActivity\nScreening\nQuestion\n(Scot PASQ)\nEnglish\nPhysical\nActivity\nScreening\nQuestion\n(Eng PASQ)\nOther (please\nactivity)\nNone of\nthese\nAware Use\nNumber of responses\nFigure 2.

This is interesting, as \nthere has been a sustained campaign by \nMacmillan Cancer Support (the UK’s leading \nsource of cancer support) to promote PA.\n27 \nClinicians not familiar with the national \nguidelines were significantly ( P = 0.05) \nless likely to advise PA to patients with a \nmultitude of disorders (Table 1).\nAwareness in different types of GPs\nAwareness of both the guidelines and \nGPPAQ increased as practice size increased \n(\nP = 0.04), but levels of use of GPPAQ \nremained broadly similar. This may reflect \nthe greater diversity of practitioners in larger \npractices. Locum GPs were less likely to be \naware of GPPAQ than either GP partners or \nsalaried GPs, but level of use was similar \n(\nP = 0.02) (Figure 4). A larger proportion \nof the salaried GPs and GP registrars \nreported specific training on PA than \npartners or locum GPs (Table 2). In addition, \npractitioners in age groups 30–39 years and \n40–49 years were more likely to be aware \nof PA assessment tools than those in age \ngroups 50–59 years or ≥60 years.\nDISCUSSION\nSummary\nThis study suggests that the majority of \nGPs are unfamiliar with the national PA \nguidelines. Predictably, those more familiar \nwith the guidelines reported increased \nconfidence in raising the issue with patients, \nas well as increased understanding and \nuse of PA tools in a clinical setting. Many of \nthose not familiar, however, did have some \nTable 1.

Although the GPPAQ \nis an internationally validated tool, this study \nreflected a complex relationship where \nawareness was much higher than use. The \ncause of this is multifactorial, with limited \nconsultation time, time constraints due to \ncomplex presenting problems, inadequate \ntraining, and perceptions of poor patient \ncompliance being some of the reasons.\n22\nUp until 2014–2015 there was a financial \nincentive to primary care in England to \nuse GPPAQ to record patient PA under \nthe hypertension Quality and Outcomes \nFramework (QOF).\n10 Potentially, removal of \nthis incentive may have impacted on use of \nthe GPPAQ, as studies have demonstrated \nthat inclusion of a health parameter within \na QOF leads to an improvement in care.\n28 \nConversely, the GPPAQ was only included \nin the QOF for 1 year, and so the effect of \nincentivisation is not fully known.\nThe results imply that the lack of skills, \nknowledge, and confidence in the guidelines \nmay have been due to most responders not \nhaving had any form of training.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe anonymity of responders encouraged \nparticipants to answer the questions \nhonestly. However, some GPs may have \nstruggled to admit lack of confidence in \nraising issues of PA, even to themselves, \nand therefore answers may not be truly \nreflective.

Therefore, this study may have \nunderestimated the level of unfamiliarity of \nthe CMO PA guidelines among all GPs.\nStudy limitations included a lack of GPs \nin training among responders. Younger \nparticipants appeared to be more familiar \nwith guidelines, and more knowledgeable \nand confident when using PA tools and so, \nif more of the responders were doctors in \ntraining, this may have been reflected in \nthe overall trends. Nurses and healthcare \nassistants, rather than GPs, conduct much \nof the preventive screening of patients in \ngeneral practice. Thus, a major limitation \nof this study is that this group of individuals \nwas not included.\nComparison with existing literature\nThere are several patient-centred studies \nthat have investigated awareness of \nPA guidelines, beliefs about activity, \nand reasons for non-participation in \nexercise.\n19–21 However, there is only limited \nliterature available on knowledge of PA \nmeasurement tools and guidelines by \nhealthcare professionals. These papers are \nlow powered, with relatively small sample \nsizes and are only regionally based.\n22–24 To \nthe authors’ knowledge, this study is the \nfirst nationwide survey to comprehensively \nassess knowledge, use, and confidence in \nPA guidelines and tools of GPs.\nImplications for research and practice\nThe knowledge and skills deficit identified \nby this study needs to be addressed in both \nundergraduate and postgraduate education, \nwith more emphasis being put on PA in the \nclinical curriculum. Some provisions already \nexist that aim to improve GP knowledge \non PA modification. One such scheme is \nthe peer-to-peer PA clinical champions \nteaching programme. This service, created \nand provided by PHE, provides free \nstructured training to health professionals \nby health professionals, to improve the \nunderstanding of PA in clinical practice so \nthey can integrate very brief advice into \ntheir day-to-day clinical practice.\n29 To date, \nthere have been six pilot regions focusing on \ndoctors. The scheme is now being rolled out \nacross the country, and expanded to allied \nhealth professionals. This is significant as, in \nthe context of current pressures on general \npractice, the time required to even briefly \ndiscuss PA interventions is more likely to \nbe available to the practice nurse or other \nmembers of the practice team than the GP. \nAnother teaching tool available is the \nonline \nBMJ learning tool on ‘physical activity \nin the treatment of long-term conditions’.30 \nThis is comprised of nine e-learning modules \non PA and health, plus a motivational \ninterviewing module. Only 2% and 3% of total \nresponders in this survey had undertaken \neither of these sessions, respectively. More \nneeds to be done to increase GP awareness \nof these and other training opportunities. \nGiven the potential gain in both patient and \npopulation outcomes, PA is an area that \nis ripe for exploration in both primary and \nsecondary care. Further research is needed \nto understand how to maximise GPPAQ use \nfor routine consultation to assess health risk \nand improvement in PA among patients.\nFunding\nNot applicable.\nEthical approval\nNo ethics approval required.\nProvenance\nFreely submitted; externally peer reviewed.\nCompeting interests \nThe authors have declared no competing \ninterests.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Nick Cavill, Melvyn \nHillsdon, and Beelin Baxter for their input \non the advisory group for the survey design. \nThey also thank MedeConnect Healthcare \nInsight (MHI), who were responsible for the \ncollection and processing of data.\nDiscuss this article\nContribute and read comments about this \narticle: bjgp.org/letters\ne674  British Journal of General Practice, October 2017\nREFERENCES\n1.
