Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven LLMs can revolutionize\nhealthcare practices by streamlining the data input process, expediting information extraction from\nunstructured narratives, and facilitating personalized patient communication.

These experts assert the belief that leveraging AI in this\nmanner can profoundly enhance the functionality of EHRs, resulting in optimized patient care, improved\nclinical decision-making, and more efficient overall healthcare management.\nThis interest has been bolstered by recent breakthroughs in the fields of natural language processing (NLP)\nand machine learning (ML), which have created new opportunities for innovation in healthcare. For\ninstance, LLMs have demonstrated exceptional capability in comprehending and processing complex\nlanguage structures \n[1]\n. When integrated into EHRs, these AI models can simplify and automate many\ncomplex tasks, leading to enhanced productivity and improved healthcare outcomes.\nIn line with this, several high-profile collaborations between tech giants and healthcare companies are\nunderway. Notably, Microsoft Corp. and Epic have announced an expanded partnership to integrate\ngenerative AI, a subtype of AI that can generate new, novel outputs, into healthcare. As part of this\ninitiative, they will be leveraging the Azure OpenAI Service in conjunction with Epic's EHR software \n[2]\n. The\nultimate goal of this collaboration is to provide AI-powered solutions that can increase productivity,\nenhance patient care, and bolster the financial integrity of health systems worldwide.\nSome of the initial solutions being developed include auto-drafting message responses for prominent health\ninstitutions like UC San Diego Health, UW Health, and Stanford Health Care. Another feature under\ndevelopment involves natural language queries in Epic's self-service reporting tool, SlicerDicer. This\npartnership builds on the history of collaboration between Microsoft, Nuance, and Epic, which has been\naimed at enabling healthcare organizations to benefit from Microsoft Cloud and Epic technologies \n[2]\n.\nIncorporating AI-powered language models can significantly enhance the data input process within EHRs.\nThese AI models enable precise and efficient transcription of spoken language, thus streamlining the often\ntime-consuming process of documenting patient interactions \n[3]\n. For instance, clinicians could dictate their\nnotes, which would then be transcribed in real-time by the AI models, thereby reducing the need for manual\ndocumentation. These models can also help extract important information from unstructured clinical\nnarratives, using NLP techniques to identify and summarize crucial clinical information from patient\nrecords. As a result, healthcare providers can access pertinent information more efficiently and effectively,\nenhancing clinical decision-making.\nThe use of LLMs can also facilitate personalized patient communication and education. Given their deep\nunderstanding of human language, these models can generate tailored, comprehensible, and empathetic\npatient communication \n[4]\n. When integrated within EHRs, healthcare providers can leverage these\n1\n1\n \n Open Access\nEditorial\n \nDOI:\n 10.7759/cureus.42634\nHow to cite this article\nNashwan A J, AbuJaber A A (July 29, 2023) Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Electronic Health Records (EHRs)\nOptimization.

It is essential to ensure that\nthese models comply with stringent privacy regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the\nEuropean Union \n[5]\n. ML models should also be trained and validated on diverse, representative datasets to\nensure the accuracy and fairness of their predictions. To address the interpretability problem, the AI system\nshould provide explanations for its predictions or recommendations, which will help healthcare providers\nmake informed decisions. Moreover, patient autonomy (through patient-centered care approach) and\ninformed consenting are vital aspects of healthcare, ensuring decisions reflect patients' preferences and\nvalues. The use of LLMs in healthcare should respect these principles and fully inform patients about AI\ninvolvement. To democratize LLMs, it is essential to create accessible and user-friendly interfaces and to\neducate the public about AI, facilitating broader understanding and engagement. Additionally, ongoing\nresearch and development efforts are needed to minimize biases in these AI models and promote fairness so\nthat the resulting healthcare solutions are equitable for all.\nIn conclusion, the integration of LLMs into EHRs represents an exciting development with the potential to\nrevolutionize healthcare delivery. By leveraging these AI-driven models, clinical efficiency, decision-\nmaking, and patient communication can be significantly enhanced. As such, researchers and professionals\nin the field of health informatics should focus on exploring and developing innovative solutions that\nharness the power of these models while simultaneously addressing critical issues related to privacy and\nfairness.\nAdditional Information\nDisclosures\nConflicts of interest:\n In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the\nfollowing: \nPayment/services info:\n All authors have declared that no financial support was received from\nany organization for the submitted work. \nFinancial relationships:\n All authors have declared that they have\nno financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might\nhave an interest in the submitted work. \nOther relationships:\n All authors have declared that there are no\nother relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\nReferences\n1\n. \nElbattah M, Arnaud É, Gignon M, et al.: \nThe role of text analytics in healthcare: a review of recent\ndevelopments and applications\n.
