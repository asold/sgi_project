  "abstract": "In this paper, the application of compact non-uniform transmission line transformers (NTLTs) in suppressing and controlling the odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency is presented. A design example showing the complete suppression of the odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency is given. In addition, several compact NTLTs are designed showing the possibility of controlling the existence of a fundamental frequency's odd harmonics. Moreover, multi-band operation using NTLTs is investigated. Speciflcally, a design example of a miniaturized triple-frequency NTLT is introduced. Based on these compact NTLTs, a 3-way triple-frequency modifled Bagley power divider (BPD) with a size reduction of 50%, and a 5-way modifled BPD with harmonics suppression and size reduction of 34%, are designed. For veriflcation purposes, both dividers are simulated using the two full-wave simulators IE3D and HFSS. Moreover, the modifled 5-way BPD with harmonics suppression is fabricated and measured. Both the simulation and measurement results validate the design approach.",
