    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a transformer into the field of credit scoring based on user online behavioral data and develop an end-to-end feature embedded transformer (FE-Transformer) credit scoring approach. The FE-Transformer neural network is composed of two parts: a wide part and a deep part. The deep part uses the transformer deep neural network. The output of the deep neural network and the feature data of the wide part are concentrated in a fusion layer. The experimental results show that the FE-Transformer deep learning model proposed in this paper outperforms the LR, XGBoost, LSTM, and AM-LSTM comparison methods in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS). This shows that the FE-Transformer deep learning model proposed in this paper can accurately predict user default risk.",
