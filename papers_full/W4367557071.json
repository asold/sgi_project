Introduction \nSince the introduction of an updated version of ChatGPT by OpenAI in November 2022 , the \nscientific uses and misuses of Artificial Intelligence (AI), more precisely large language models \n(LLMs) in research and teaching is no longer a fringe phenomenon, but discussed in the broad \nscientific and non-scientific public (Shen et al., 2023; Singhal et al., 2023; Teubne r et al., 2023). \nLLMs are artificial neural networks that generate human-like sounding texts based on a powerful \nnatural language processing model, for example called Chat GP T meaning Generative Pretrained \nTransformer\". LLMs process information extracted from books, online forums, social media, and \nnews articles. Furthermore, LLMs rely on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Joshi \net al., 2019). \nFocusing on the specific case of academia, we witness that LLMs are increasingly integrated into \nscientific writing processes (Samek et al., 2021). For example, LLM tools write texts that are \nhardly distinguishable from texts written by scientists or detectable by plagiarism software \n(Sharples, 2022). Moreover, LLMs already draft scientific publications (Thunström et al ., 2022). \nSo far, the use cases of LLMs illustrate its ability to write plausible-sounding statements. However, \nto date, LLMs cannot replace academics, but may serve academics as a research writing aid. \nBesides its function as writing aid, LLMs could be utilized either for summarization or citation \npurposes. In 2023, context-sensitive summarization and citation still problematic despite recent \nprogress, as newer programs still have problems to cite correctly or even invents citations (Tang \net al., 2023; Thunström et al., 2022). Yet, it seems only a matter of time befor e LLM -based \nprograms correctly cite literature context -sensitively at the correct locations within texts, \nespecially if the LLM is coupled w ith citation databases and acquire full -text access to major \npublishers (“Tools Such as ChatGPT Threaten Transparent Science” 2023).  \nAssuming that LLMs will be able to correctly cite and contextualize academic outputs (e.g. , \narticles), LLMs could offer personalized research support to individual researchers based on their \nresearch trajectories, interests and needs. LLMs could identify patterns, trends and gaps in large \namounts of research data faster than human researchers  could. In addition, the translation \ncapabilities of LLMs have increased rapidly, making it possible to access research and publications \nin many languages, bridging previous language gaps. These opportunities face the challenge that \ncurrent unequal academic structures are inscribed in LLMs. Therefore we call a strong reliance on \nLLMs and the unquestioned belief in the power of black-boxed deep-learning algorithms – in our \ncase LLMs – bot delusion after Dawkins’ (2006) The God Delusion. – The bot delusion may result \nin overtly strong faith in the summarization, citation, and productivity increasing potentia l of \nLLMs. Delusional academics refrain from critical reflection about the output and the \ncircumstances, in which these models were trained.  For example, LLMs encounter pre -existing \nacademic social structures and inequalities that affect the citation and publication landscapes, \nincluding inequalities in prestige, financial endowment, or embeddedness in research networks \n(Wu et al., 2019). In addition, national and organizational reward schemes, especially when using \nscientometric indicators and large bibliometric databases (de Rijcke et al. 2016; Shin et al. 2023), \nand disciplinary evaluation of research communication affect academic social structures for reward \nand reputation-gain. The article's central question is how the use of LLMs will a ffect academics' \npublication and citation behavior, i.e., could LLMs construct a bot delusion or motivate change in \nthe scientific system? To address these inquiries, we conduct a theory -led thought experiment \n \n3 \n(Brendel 2005) 1 since LLMs are not yet obtainable, and no data is available. The thought \nexperiment enables us to predict possible futures of the widespread use of LLMs, and to construct \nscenarios for either the reproduction (stasis) or alteration (catharsis) of social inequalities within \nacademia.  \nBy focusing on human behavioral issues and not addressing technological and other issues \nconcerning LLMs, we define LLMs as a prime example of human-computer-interaction, in which \na machine's program ming has intended and unintended, anticipated and unanticipated \nconsequences for human action (Merton, 1936, 1968). Aware only of the intentional programming \nof LLMs training data selection, including Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback , we \nfocus on anticipated consequences for academics’ social action, in our case academics’ publication \nand citations behavior. In Section 2, we discuss structural social conditions linked to the “Matthew \nEffect” (Merton, 1968)  of status accumulation in academia . Building upon the discussion of \nstructural social conditions in academia and for the anticipated consequences of the training of \nLLMs in Section 3 , we unfold three scenarios coined “ reproducing content and status quo” , \n“content coherence evaluation” , and “content evaluation”  (Section 4) . In the scenarios we  \nexamine how the triad of structural features of academia, LLMs, and the bot delusion affect \nacademia and discuss their potential to produce a sta sis or induce changes in the publication and \ncitation landscape. To discuss the possible social behavior of scientists in our thought experiment, \nwe use Merton's (1973) CUDOS norms of communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, and \norganized skepticism and Mitroff’s (1974) SPIOD counter-norms of secrecy, particularism, self -\ninterestedness and organized dogmatism  (Section 5). The idealized CUDOS norms reflect the \ncatharsis opportunity offered by LLM s, and stasis is reflected in  the SPIOD counter -norms. As \nSPIOD only captures the individual counter -norms, we introduce communal counter -norms to \ncapture academics’ stars, theory, method, findings, etc., loyal citation behavior. By summarizing \nthe consequences, scenarios, and norms shown in three possible futures, we conclude our thought \nexperiment (Section 6).  \n2. Structural conditions for the unequal visibility and citability of publications \nPrevious higher education and science research suggests that publication opportunity, visibility \nand citeability is characterized by extreme levels of inequality in academia (Kiesslich et al., 2021; \nMünch, 2014; Nielsen & Andersen, 2021; Wieczorek & Münch, 2023).  The main mechanism to \nexplain such inequalities and their accumulation over time is captured by the “Matthew Effect” \n(Merton, 1968). The Matthew Effect is understood as path dependency that stems from actors \nhaving enjoyed a comparative advantage at a time t0 that has magnified into disproportionately \nhigher advantages at t 1. In our case , four dimensions of the Matthew Effect are relevant for \nexplaining academics’ publication and citation behavior  at an individual as well as a structural \nlevel: prestige hierarchy of researchers and disciplines , the access to the publication system,  \nrepresentation of disciplinary communities in bibliographic databases, and norms of collaboration \nand publication in disciplinary communities. \nDimension 1, prestige hierarchy of researchers and institutions: At the individual level, reasons \nfor the occurrence of the Matthew Effect regarding the publication - and citation inequalities \ninclude the seniority of a researcher, and his or her designation as principal in vestigator. As senior \nresearchers and principal investigators are perceived as more prestigious than their co -authors, \npublications (co -)authored by these academics are being cited disproportionately more often \n \n1 A well-known example for a thought experiment is Schrödinger’s Cat in the status quo analysis of quantum \nmechanics (Schrödinger 1935). \n \n4 \ncompared to publications issues by colleagues with similar content and of similar quality (van Dijk \net al., 2014). At the organizational level, the Matthew Effect stems from differences in the prestige \nof universities and research institutes. Publications by authors affiliated with an Elite University \nare more likely to be published, and cited because of the attributed reputation of the institution \n(Teixeira da Silva, 2021). \nDimension 2, prestige hierarchy of disciplines: Similar to individual and institutional hierarchies, \nacademia is  characterized by a prestige hierarchy , in which disciplines with high degree s of \nformalization and predictive power are particularly esteemed (Cole 1983). This prestige hierarchy \nmanifests in citation figures and the dissemination of concepts across disciplinary boundaries. In \nparticular, the natural sciences export concepts to other academic communities and refrain from \ndoing so the other way around (Benjafield, 2020; Fanelli & Glänzel, 2013). At the same time, \nscholars in the humanities and s ocial sciences increasingly align their publication structure with \nthe STEM disciplines, despite being skeptical about their publication practices and metrics \nattached (Deutz et al., 2021; Hammarfelt & Haddow, 2018; Schneijderberg et al. 2022). These \narguments combined indicate a dominance of STEM based on the chances of being cited in (more \nvisible or higher ranked) journals across multiple disciplines and the subordination of social \nsciences and humanities under the STEM citation behavior. \nDimension 3, access to the publication system : Disciplinary communities, whose main form of \ncommunication are English-language articles, are overrepresented in the bibliometric databases \nSCOPUS and Web of Science (Vera-Baceta et al., 2019). Even if they publish in English, similar \napplies to research communities situated in regions, which are not traditionally viewed as academic \ncenters (e.g. Africa or South America). Only few journals situated in these parts of the world are \ncovered by big bibliographic databases such as SCOPUS or Web of Science (Guzman-Valenzuela \net al., 2023). Consequently, these ignore relevant and highly cited, but also regionally specialized \nresearch output which is not geared towards the Anglophone world  (Zavale & Schneijderberg, \n2020). The interplay of these communities with publication databases entails higher chances to \npublish in high -ranking journals and to dominate the status market of ideas. Additionally, the \nJournal Impact Factor serves as quality  bucket for all articles published in a journal – although \ncitation counts are significantly skewed (Wang, 2014) due to interactions with the Matthew Effect \non individual and institutional level. \nDimension 4 , collaboration and publication in disciplinary communities : Collaboration norms \nlinked to citation- and publication patterns differ between disciplines. These differences include, \nthe size of research teams and co -authors per publication (Larivière, et al., 2015a, 2015b), the \nability of scholars to acquire international collaborations (Kwiek, 2020), the chances to conduct \ninterdisciplinary research (Fontan a et al., 2020), and the recognition of articles, conference \nproceedings, or monographs as high quality research outputs (Yair et al., 2022). \nTaken together, these four drivers of social inequality regarding visibility and citeability of \nscholarly publications are the stage, which LLMs enter. Yet how LLMs interact with these drivers, \nis open to debate, but how they possibly interact is subject of the next section. \n3. Anticipated consequences of the training of LLMs for the academic \npublication and citation system \nTo train LLMs, books, online forums, social media, and news articles are used, in addition to \nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. As LLMs rely on either openly available training \ndata on the web (e.g., Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus; Raffel et al., 202 0), we have to consider \n \n5 \nhow the social structures in academia outlined above correlate with digital open knowledge sources \n(e.g., open access publishing and preprint servers) and closed knowledge sources (e.g., \nbibliometric databases). \nStarting with closed knowledge sources, we note that the Matthew Effect is amplified by the \noligopoly of the SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. These databases act as business \ngatekeepers for ranked journals, which, for example, in the Elsevier business model means a \ncunning co-enforcement of SCOPUS indexed journals and publishing of some of those indexed \njournals. As the indexing is considered as quality indicator within (considerable parts of) academia \n(Ioannidis & Thombs, 2019), the anticipated consequences are that an article published in a journal \nwith high impact factor is more likely to be cited compared to a similar content and quality article \npublished in a low or no impact journal. However, any publisher could bypass the database \noligopolies by seeking a cooperation with LLM -providers, which would boost any (non -indexed \njournal) publication, and, as intended consequence, citations. \nConsidering hierarchies in academia, we note that the dissemination of concepts as well as the \naccumulation of citations are reinforced by coverage disparities in Web of Science and SCOPUS \n(Aksnes & Sivertsen, 2019). Therefore, both concepts and sources st emming from the natural \nsciences are expected to be cited with a higher likelihood across scientific disciplines. Moreover, \nbibliometric databases exhibit biases in favor of disciplinary communities that began publishing \nin journals earlier and more system atically.Furthermore, predominantly English -language \npublications are included in bibliometric databases. In fact, the coverage in bibliometric databases \nof publications published in the (semi)periphery is vanishingly small (Tennant, 2020). This yields \na negative i mpact on the visibility of publications and ideas not located in the Anglo -American \ncenter of academic publishing (Confraria et al., 2017). The consequences of the SCOPUS and Web \nof Science selectivity are an under -coverage of particular disciplin es and geographic regions in \nsaid databases (Stahlschmidt & Stephen, 2020), for example Africa (Asubiaro & Onaolapo, 2023; \nTijssen, 2007). The establishment of the Brazil-based, also publications in Portuguese and Spanish \nindexing ScieELO emphasizes the so cio-structural significance of bibliometric databases in \nacademia. Such unequal access opportunities to databases combined with simultaneous pressure \nto publish in a journal or conference proceeding allowed the emergence of a publication economy \nof predatory journals and conferences, which particularly affects scientists in the (semi)periphery \n(Mills & Inouye, 2021).  \nIn addition, predatory and acknowledged open access (OA) journals and publishers that enable \nOA by charging article -processing charges (APC) are putting poorly funded scientists and \ncountries at a severe disadvantage (Cantwell et al., 2018). In addition to  the APC-paywall, the \nexistence of OA publishing opportunities are unevenly distributed between disciplinary \ncommunities (Bahlai et al., 2019). OA published articles are read and cited more frequently, which \ncan impact reputation -gain, and career promotion s (Wang et al., 2015). However, many \ndisciplinary communities have successfully established OA online journals by themselves, which \nare indexed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (https://doaj.org/). Finally, training \nopportunities also arise from the existence, disciplinary acceptance, and usage of preprint servers \n(e.g., SOCarXiv).   \n4. Three scenarios for future development of academic publishing and \ncitations \nAcknowledging the extremely dynamic state of LLMs development, LLMs bot delusion potential, \nand the difficulties to forecast its impact on academia, we focus on unintended but – in the course \n \n6 \nof our thought experiment – anticipated consequences for social action according to their potential \nfor either stasis, catharsis, or (elements of) both. In our case, stasis equates with the intensification \nof existing inequalities and the structures that bore them over time, thereby limiting the discursive \nspace in academia and keeping up the faith in scientific authorities (e.g.  members of prestigious \nuniversities). Catharsis, in turn, means their overcoming. The following three scenarios assume \nthat LLM-based programs will gain access to databases and repositories that include scholarly \npublications such as journal articles, preprints, and books. If LLMs learn when it is opportune to \ncite a source, then they could either adopt the currently existing patterns of citation in science, or \nbe deliberately trained differently. The main takeaways are listed in Table 1 and the scenarios are \ndiscussed in detail below. \nThe first scenario, which we name ‘reproducing content and status quo,’ assumes that LLMs learn \nthat a context sensitive citation is to be chosen according to the (highest) number of citations, for \nexample related to specific combinations of keywords. Accordingly, the most visible publications \nby the most prestigious researchers would occur disproportionately often  in LLMs citation \nsuggestions. This would induce Matthew Effects, increase structural inequalities in the science \nsystem, and lead to the following anticipated consequences: publications issued by established \nscientists from a) Anglo-American countries, b) highly reputed universities, c) STEM-disciplines \nwith high appeal to other subjects, and d) a journal-centric publication culture, are cited more often \nthan other scientists are by LLMs.  \nIn addition, the size of subject communities, and their propensity to publish OA and preprints could \nincrease their visibility disproportionally.  In turn, non-STEM disciplines, scholars , and non -\nEnglish outlets from the (semi-)periphery could be marginalized and occluded even further. This \nis especially true, if the services provided by LLMs are hidden behind a paywall.  \nIf scholars are socialized within this context and experience the application of LLMs as daily \nroutine, they might either 1a) do not critically read or check the cited sources, 1b) focus on reading \nother sources or conducting research without link to previ ous research instead, or 1c) critically \nreflect on LLMs. The latter might lead either to the refusal of LLMs or the drive to improve or \ngame the system. In the first two cases, the bot delusion is at play because scholars use LLMs \nunquestionably, whereas in the 1c) the scholars are either discouraged to use a tool which bears \ncompetitive advantages, or are deluded because they overestimate their chance to change the \nsystem. Either way, the group following the first two strategies might prevail, where as the group \nfollowing the last one (1c strategy) might be seen as being against the rules of the academic game \nand might be driven out of academia along with their ideas. \nOur second scenario, which we call ‘content coherence evaluation ,’ assumes that the similarity \nbetween text-segments, for example from the methods or discussion sections , will be the main \ncriterion for LLM programming to produce citation suggestions for scientists. For this to work, \n(full-)text access  to articles , for example,  in journal databases , on preprint servers, OA-\npublications, and books is required. In this scenario, authors’ could choose not to cite the most \ncited publication(s) and/or cite additional or other publications, which would partially mitigate \nstructural effects in academia.  \n  \n \n7 \nTable 1: LLM-induced unintended but anticipated consequences for academics’ citation behavior: Catharsis and stasis in citation and publishing behavior of \nacademics \nScenario Citation characteristics Anticipated consequences catharsis Anticipated consequences stasis \n1 \nReproducing \ncontent and \nstatus quo \nLLM recognizes that “good” \nliterature equals high \ncitation count and \npublication in high impact \njournal \n- • Exacerbation of existing status hierarchies \n• Citation of articles by established (mostly male) \nscholars from Anglo-American countries.  \n• Further marginalization of disciplines with weak \nties to journaling and low access to high impact \njournals \n2 Content \ncoherence \nevaluation \nLLM cites literature that is \nappropriate in content \nconditioned on the \navailability of full texts \n• Selecting appropriate sources for citation \n• Reduction of cognitive burden regarding \nacademic work \n• Diversification and improved substantiation of \nthe knowledge base in articles \n• Reduction of the overrepresentation of English-\nlanguage publications \n• Expansion of open access scholarly knowledge \n• Open-access Matthew Effect \n• Extinction of monographs \n• Old, out-of-license monographs Matthew Effect \n• Strengthening of predatory journals \n• Emergence of a digital extraction industry \n3 Content \nevaluation \nLLM as part of quality \ncontrol in human-\ncomputer-interaction \n• Selecting appropriate sources and rejecting \nerroneous sources \n• Inclusion of previously unnoticed and relevant, \nbut poorly cited literature \n• Extinction of predatory journals \n• Sieving out reputable sources due to internal \nprofessional or personal disputes \n• Reinforcement of citation cartels \n• Division and epistemological narrowing of \ndisciplines \n \n  \n \n8 \nHere, scholars could use LLMs twofold to improve their career prospect and to disproportionally \nincrease their publication output and visibility. They could use LLMs for 2a) hyperspecialization, \nmeaning that they focus on a single strand of research and dig into strands of research not \nsummarized and cited by LLMs in their small domain. Furthermore, LLMs might identify research \ngaps in specialized domains. The time saved could then be reinvested into conducting research in \nthis domain. 2b) LLMs could also alleviate some risks associated with i nterdisciplinary research, \nwhich is considered as high-risk, high-reward strategy because of lower publication rates (Leahey \net al., 2017). Here, LLMs could identify research gaps, connect otherwise disconn ected thought \nproducts, or translate concepts from one domain to the other. This might speed up the research \nprocess enormously, especially if a number of highly specialized scholars collaborate, which then \ncould complement their skills. However, the same constraints apply as discussed in 1a) to 1c) \nwhich may easily undo possible positive effects. \nDespite the chances outlined, t his scenario entails the following challenges. First, disciplinary \ncommunities with little propensity to publish in journals, OA publications, and preprint servers \nwill be marginalized in the long run. Second, for monographs to remain eligible for citation, their \nfull text must be accessible for LLMs. In this case, o lder, no longer licensed  monographs could \nfurther increase in citations or experience a citation renaissance if scanned and made available by \ngoogle-books and other services. Otherwise, we may witness the eventual demise of monographs, \nand thus of certain disciplinary achievements. Third, OA publications in predatory journals might \nalso be included in LLM-produced citation suggestions. On the one hand, what is a predatory \njournal is not always clear , for example  as the discussion about MDPI publisher illustrates  \n(Oviedo-García, 2021). On the other hand, early career researchers and scientists external to a \ndiscipline might be ignorant to the predatory status of a journal . This may result in the growth of \nthe predatory journal industry with little quality control and expensive price tags if scholars seek \nto get published.  \nExtending scenario two, we call  the third scenario  ‘content evaluation ’. Using Reinforcement \nLearning from Human Feedback, further quality control for LLMs could be applied. Based on 2a) \nand 2b), scholars could rate how specific, interdisciplinary, intersectional, or international (e.g. \nregionally diverse), and relevant LLMs outputs might be. They could also curate the texts and lists \nof references. This curation might then be employed to retrain LLMs to provide more specific and \ndetailed outputs. \nBoundary conditions are, first, that the similarity between text s and/or keyword combinations is \nthe basis for citation suggestions by LLM-programs. A second boundary condition is the inclusion \nof in scenarios 1 and 2 omitted and marginalized texts within the scientific discourse. These might \notherwise remain unconsidered as training data and – consequently – being left out of the model \noutput. For this scenario to work out, scholars critically engaged in the literature and the output of \nLLMs as described i n 1c) are needed. If, however, LLMs were trained on input provided by \nscholars with “bot delusion”, then this scenario would quickly align to the first scenario. \nIn this scenario, a LLM would offer citation suggestions including both the specific text passages \nto which the citation s refers and open access to the suggested publications . This enables \nresearchers to evaluate whether a citation is appropriate, and in case of several algorithm-produced \ncitation suggestions select one or more appropriate citations. Given the critical stance of scholars \nin regards to the sugges tions provided by LLMs, both combined  could firstly contribute to erase \nthe memory of retracted publications (e.g., plagiarism)  and secondly to the demise of predatory \njournals. Overall, this could lead to a catharsis and thus profound changes towards more (citation-\n \n9 \n)equality in academia and the inclusion of previously unknown knowledge and potential for \nproblem solving. \n5. Normative discussion of academics’ citation and publication behavior in \ntimes of LLMs \nIn the three scenarios, we discuss how the evolution of LLMs could lead to  a reproduction of \npreexisting structurally conditioned inequalities in science (stasis), or to a catharsis that counteracts \nthe structural inequalities or both. The three scenarios are constructed as ideal types that may serve \nas hypotheses for future testing . In fact, how the science system evolves depends on  the active \nusage of and the degree to which scholars suffer from the bot delusion, how human-data selection, \nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, inclusion or exclusion of relevant  information \nand social groups (e.g. , papers published by authors situated in the so-called Global South), is \nperformed, and if (mis-)application is minimized. To discuss the potential impacts of LLMs' usage \nbehavior in academia , we use  Merton’s (1973) scientific CUDOS norms of Communalism, \nUniversalism, Disinterestedness, and Organized Skepticism to capture the catharsis opportunity \noffered by LLM. To reflect the stasis possibilities we use Mitroff’s (1974) SPIOD counter-norms \nof Secrecy, Particularism, self-Interestedness and Organized Dogmatism. As SPIOD only captures \nthe individual counter -norms, we introduce communal counter -norms to capture scholars’ loyal \ncitation behavior.  \nOf course, normative considerations such as Merton’s (1973) “Normative Structure of Science ,” \ni.e., the CUDOS, bear the risk of being considered as “social stereotypes” (Mulkay 1976: 647) . \nHowever, CUDOS as principles for robust scientific research  expressed by Merton (1973) in his \nremarks on the impact of the scientific system in the 1940s, seem still valid in the beginning of the \n21st century (Anderson et al. 2010). \nBeginning with the CUDOS -norms, LLMs could enable scientists to pursue the universalism, \ndisinterestedness and organized skepticism norms. Focusing on LLMs supported citation behavior \nof scientists, Merton’s (1973) communalism norm ( “scientists openly sha re new findings with \ncolleagues;” operationalized by Anderson 2000: 447) is  fulfilled, per se, and Mitroff’s (1974) \nsecrecy counter norm ( “scientists protect their newest findings to ensure priority in publishing, \npatenting, or applications;” Anderson 2000: 448) does not apply. This is, however, only possible \nif 1) scholars are granted equal access to LLMs, 2) publications behind a paywall are made \naccessible, and 3) if LLMs are open to use for all. Other Mertonian norms relevant for the \ndiscussion are: \n• Universalism: “Scientists evaluate research only on its merit, i.e., according to accepted \nstandards of the field.” \n• Disinterestedness: “Scientists are motivated by the desire for knowledge and discovery, \nand not by the possibility of personal gain.” \n• Organized Skepticism : “Scientists consider all new evidence, hypotheses, theories, and \ninnovations, even those that challenge or contradict their own work.” \nAs long as scholars do not blindly follow the suggestions of LLMs and suffer from the bot delusion, \nassuming the correctness and applicability of LLM s output, the CUDOS norms apply to the \ncatharsis category in scenario 2 (LLMs cite literature that is appropriate in content conditioned on \nthe availability of full texts ) and even stronger in scenario 3 ( LLMs as part of quality control in \nhuman-computer-interaction) in Table 1. From a normative perspective, CUDOS norms seem most \n \n10 \napplicable to catharsis due to ‘content evaluation’ (scenario 3), and are represented to a lesser \ndegree in ‘content coherence evaluation’ (scenario 2). Normatively, scenario 1 stasis enabled by \nLLMs seems to be driven by Mitroff’s particularism counter-norm which we formulate as follows: \nScientists pro mote their (newest) findings to ensure priority in citations, publishing  or other \nresearch-related applications. Coherently, Mitroff’s (1974) s elf-interestedness norm (“scientists \ncompete with others in the same field for funding and rec ognition of their achievements;” \nAnderson 2000: 448) and organized dogmatism (“scientists invest their careers in promoting their \nown most important findings, theories or innovations ;” Anderson 2000: 448) prevail. In scenario \n1 (‘content and status quo’) , organized dogmatism and self -interestedness seem to be promoted  \nprimarily by particularism: “Scientists assess new knowledge and its applications based on the \nreputation and past productivity of the individual or research group” (Anderson 2000: 448). \nThis is related to hyperspecialisation (2a), but combined with in-group favoritism. Both could lead \nto crowding out of innovative research or competing ideas and the scholars following the \nassociated lines of research. There is, in fact, a risk that this could be sold as universalism if schools \nof thought assume that their paradigm is the only valid one and employ strategies to optimize their \npublication- and citation curation behavior to optimize the suggestions presented to others using \nLLMs.  \nAgainst the backdrop of the potential misuse of LLMs outlined above by members of different \nschools of thought , we argue that the SPIOD focus on the individual academics’ social status \nseeking, which  ranks higher than  the cognitive dimension of science, requires amendment for \ncollectives. Modifying the operationalizations for particularism, self-interestedness and organized \ndogmatism by Anderson (2000)  of Mitroff (1974) , we suggest the individual complementing  \ncollective particularism, -interestedness and organized dogmatism counter-norms (C-PIOD): \n• Collective particularism: Scientists assess new knowledge and its applications based on \ntheir association with a theory, method or methodology, etc. to loyally promote the \nreputation and market the productivity of their group. \n• Collective-interestedness norm : to be more competitive  in publishing, acquisition of  \nfunding and receiving recognition of achievements, scientists strive for publications with \nor, at least, closely associated to the star scientist, school founder, etc., push citation counts \n(and journal metrics) primarily according to their loyal association with a theory, method \nor methodology, etc. \n• Collectively organized dogmatism: scientists invest their careers in loyally promoting the \nmost important findings, theories , methods or innovations of godmothers and godfathers \n(school founders, star scientists, respected fellows, strategic partners, etc .). In addition to \nexcessive citing, for example, in relevance and substance suggesting literature reviews, \ncommon means are the editing of collected works (with or without translation), writing of \ncheer-reviews of new books, etc.. In a more abstract way, these inconspicuous actions aim \nfor the  establishment and /or maintenance of a n organized dogmatic  “protective belt”  \n(Lakatos 1997: 133) to avoid attention shift away from a theory, method or methodology, \netc.  \n‘Collective particularism, ’ ‘collective-interestedness,’ and ‘collectively organized dog matism’ \npromote a particular “thought style” (Fleck 1981: 2; in German: Denkstil) as the very narrow \ncognitive condition or system within a particular “thought community” (Denkgemeinschaft; Fleck \n1981: 45): \n \n11 \n“What we are faced with here is not so much  simple passivity or mistrust of new ideas as \nan active approach  which can be divided into several stages. (1) A contradiction to the  \nsystem appears unthinkable. (2) What does not fit into the system  remains unseen; (3) \nalternatively, if it is noticed, either it is kept  secret, or (4) laborious efforts are made to \nexplain an exception in terms that do not contradict the system. (5) Despite the legitimate  \nclaims of contradictory views, one tends to see, describe, or even  illustrate those \ncircumstances, which corroborate current views and thereby give them substance. \nWhen Fleck (1981) wrote the above-cited lines in 1935, few (e.g., Bradford 1934) were thinking \nabout the meaning of counting citations  and journal metrics,  and nobody imagined anticipat ing \nconsequences of LLM on academics’ citation behavior. However, ignoring contradicting content \nand seeking for new content related to a particular theory, method, topic findings, etc.  and the \ndecision to cite or not to cite a publication seem of a similar courses of conduct as described by \nFleck (1981) – especially, in times of unprecedented growth -rates of publications ( Bornmann & \nMutz 2015). In addition, since many decades, awarding citations and collecting large numbers of \ncitations suffice to substantiate a particular  thought style (e.g., topic, method and theory), of \ncourse, supported by the Matthew Effect. \n6. Conclusion \nIn the article at hand, we conducted a thought experiment to grasp the anticipated consequences \ninstalled in the fast development of LLM s and, consequently, their disruptive potential for the \nscientific system. Additionally, we investigated how they might induce a bot delusion, and a stasis \nor catharsis on academia and scientific disciplines therein . For this purpose,  we first introduced \nfour dimensions of the Matthew effect linked to structural inequalities of academia. Second, we \noutlined anticipated consequences, which may occur if LLMs enter the academic stage and interact \nwith pre -existing structures accountable for durable and increasing inequalities . Third, we \npresented three scenarios combining the dimensions of the Matthew effect and the anticipated \nconsequences: Scenario 1 ‘reproducing content and status quo ’ assumes that LLMs learn that a \ncontext sensitive citation is to be chosen according to the (highest) number of citations. Scenario \n2 ‘content coherence evaluation ’ assumes that the similarity between text -segments will be the \nmain criterion for LLM s programming to produce citation suggestions for scientists. Extending \nscenario 2, we named scenario 3 ‘content evaluation,’ which uses reinforced learning from human \nfeedback further quality enhancement of LLMs. \nIn the next step of the thought experiment, we discussed the three scenarios, drawing on Merton's \nCUDOS norms and Mitroff's SPIOD counter -norms (please note that for published research, \nMerton’s (1973) communalism norm is fulfilled, and Mitroff’s (1974) secrecy counter-norm does \nnot apply. Accordingly, in the respective acronym s, the C (communalism) and S (secrecy) are \ncrossed-out). Extending the individual counter -norms, we suggested three collective counter-\nnorms related to academics’ citation behavior  (C-PIOD). These are  ‘collective particularism’ \n(loyal promotion of the method or methodology, theory, findings, etc. of their thought community), \n‘collective-interestedness’ (loyal follower associated to the founding father(s) or mother(s) of the \nmethod or methodology , theory, findings , etc.  of their thought community ), and ‘collectively \norganized dogmatism’ (pushing citation counts (and journal metrics) as party loyalists to a theory, \nmethod or methodology, etc.). \n  \n \n12 \nTable 2: Status quo, mixed-access and open science publication and citation futures according to the C*UDOS, \nS*PIOD and C-PIOD norms \n CUDOS SPIOD C-PIOD \nStatus quo science future (based on scenario 1): \na) Unlimited reproduction of social structures in \nacademia. \nb) Primacy of social, i.e., cultural, economic, etc. \ncharacteristics of academia enabled by closed \nscience dominates research content. \n+ +++ +++ \nMixed-access science future (based on scenario 2): \na) Partial reproduction of social structures in \nacademia, and partial openness. \nb) More socio-cognitive balance enabled by research \ncontent coherence evaluation of publications. \n++ ++ ++ \nOpen science future (based on scenario 3): \na) Limited reproduction of social structures in \nacademia. \nb) Primacy of cognitive characteristics of academia \nenabled by full access to publications dominates \nresearch content. \n+++ + + \n* Please note that for published research, Merton’s (1973) communalism norm is fulfilled, and Mitroff’s (1974) \nsecrecy counter-norm does not apply. Accordingly, in the respective acronym, the C (communalism) and S (secrecy) \nare crossed-out. \n+ = low normative weight; ++ = medium normative weight; +++ = high normative weight  \n \nTo conclude, we anticipate the following LLM-induced future stasis and/or catharsis developments \ncitation patterns (Table 2): \n1. Status quo science future (based on scenario 1) : In this scenario, LLM suggests citations \nranked according to citation and publication volumes, i.e., prioritizes metrics over content. \nIn this way, LLM replicates prevalent  academics’ citation behavior, thereby leading to \nstasis. This perpetuates the well-known social inequality structures in academia generated \nby status-keeping and -seeking of academics (reputation-gain via citation), financial means \n(pay for open access publications) and English language dominance. Maintaining the social \nstructure also seems to be in the economic interest of journal publishers and owners of the \nWoS and SCOPUS databases. Stasis does not rule-out cognitive advancement of science, \nyet, most likely by established, eminent academics. They have the advantage through stasis \nthat their privileges are perpetuated, which is supported by C-PIOD loyalty. \n2. Mixed-access science future (based on scenario 2) : LLMs use closed and open access \npublications from recognized outlets, and internet sources (e.g., reports, working papers, \nblogs and webpages) for suggesting citations. LLM citation suggestions are neither quality \ncontrolled with respect to the sources nor transparent from which text passages citation \nrecommendations originate. Accordingly, scientists have to check sources of LLM citation \nsuggestions, since predatory journals and unspecified internet sources are also accessed by \n \n13 \nLLM. For closed science publications, for example indexed in WoS and Scopus databases, \nonly the abstracts of publications are available, which does not enable academics to read \nall content for a comprehensive content comparison. Scenario 2 initially promises catharsis, \nas LLM suggestions are based on content rather than citation rank metrics. In comparison \nto this partial openness, the effort of quality control and the uncertainty of possibly citing \ndubious sources, ultimately, the catharsis is balanced by stasis, as academics continue with \nstatus quo science (as captured in future 1) and engage in ‘collective particularism’ and \n‘collective organized dogmatism’ as means of quality control. \n3. Open science future (based on scenario 3): In this future, LLM citation suggestion are based \non content coherence , which  is coupled with Reinforcement Learning from Human \nFeedback. Continuing learning by LLM based on  human feedback enables further \ndevelopment of LLM citation suggestions, especially  concerning quality control. In the \nopen science future, LLMs serve to identify research topic relevant diverse knowledge in \npublications for citation. Open access to all scientific publications enable academics’ in -\ndepth content evaluation, which could prevent academics’ regression into C-PIOD counter-\nnorms and metrics-induced reproduction of content and status quo. A catharsis could occur. \nIn addition, a coupling with languages translation algorithms would be necessary to break \nthe dominance of English as scientific language. \n \nIf LLMs help s to identify relevant  literature, and if scientists take advantage of the resulting \nopportunity to consider new evidence, hypotheses, theories, and innovations, even those that \nchallenge or contradict their own work, then the guiding norm of organized skepticism could be \nfulfilled (catharsis in scenario 3). However, this would also require that the universalism norm be \nfulfilled, that is, that scientists judge research only by its content merits, according to the accepted \nstandards of the field. If the application of LLMs contribute to softening stasis in scenario 1, i.e., \nlessening of  particularism, self-interestedness and organized dogmatism, this  would promote  \nscholarship (e.g., methods and theory development, and empirical research) and a science system \nbetter equipped to meet the many global challenges (e.g., expressed in the 17 Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals). \nNonetheless, our thought experiment yields a number of limitations. First, we extrapolate from the \ngiven developments and cannot truly anticipate if there will be emerging technologies in the \ndomain of LLMs or normative settings in which our thoughts get obsolete. Second, we focus on \nthe possibility to affect the current information-seeking and citation behavior of scholars who are \nalready take part in the publication game. The socialization of scientists during their ( doctoral-\n)training and how it is dealt  with LLM during studies may also be an important factor to be \nconsidered, but are out of focus in the current article. Finally, the discussion on LLMs might also \nbe a chance to reflect on the academic publication - and citation system at large, leading to the \nimplementation of new norms, which might mitigate the effects of LLMs on academia. \nUltimately, the academic community at large must find a new consensus, or will transfer the \nresponsibility to the scholars and scientists, which then might be free to follow the oligarchic trend. \nAt best, our commentary might be of help for the community to find a common ground, or, at least, \nmight help scholars to navigate through the fallacies of using LLMs (more or less) ethically.  Our \nthree scenarios and science futures might provide working hypotheses or inspire other scholars to \nreflect on the interplay between LLMs, the possible bot delusion on individual and collective level, \nand persisting structures of inequality in academia. \n \n14 \n \nReferences \nAksnes, D.
