  "abstract": "Abstract Accessing accurate medication insights is vital for enhancing patient safety, minimizing errors, and supporting clinical decision-making. However, healthcare professionals in Africa often rely on manual and time-consuming processes to retrieve drug information, exacerbated by limited access to pharmacists due to brain drain and healthcare disparities. This paper presents “Drug Insights,” an open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to streamline medication lookup for healthcare workers in Africa. By leveraging a corpus of Nigerian pharmaceutical data and advanced AI technologies, including Pinecone databases and GPT models, the system delivers accurate, context-specific responses with minimal hallucination. The chatbot integrates prompt engineering and S-BERT evaluation to optimize retrieval and response generation. Preliminary tests, including pharmacist feedback, affirm the tool’s potential to improve drug information access while highlighting areas for enhancement, such as UI/UX refinement and extended corpus integration.",
