In order to increase precision in searching for web pages or web doc-\numents, taking the temporal dimension into account is gaining increased interest.\nA particular problem for web documents found on the Internet is that in gen-\neral, no trustworthy timestamp is available. This is due to its decentralized nature\nand the lack of standards for time and date. In previous work we have presented\ntechniques for solving this problem. In this paper, we present a tool for deter-\nmining the timestamp of a non-timestamped document (using ﬁle, URL or text\nas input) using temporal language models . We also outline how this tool will be\ndemonstrated.\n1 Introduction\nIn order to increase precision in searching for web pages or web documents, taking the\ntemporal dimension into account is gaining increased interest. In this way, the search\nengine will retrieve documents according to both text and temporal criteria, i.e., tempo-\nral text-containment search [5].\nDue to its decentralized nature and the l ack of standards for time and date, it is\ndifﬁcult to determine an accurate and tru stworthy timestamp of a web document. In a\nweb warehouse or a web archive, there is no guarantee that the creation time and the\ntime of retrieval by the crawler are related.\nIn this paper, we present a tool for determining timestamp of a non-timestamped doc-\nument using temporal language models. The tool can take as input a ﬁle, contents from an\nURL, or text entered directly. As output it will present an estimation of possible creation\ntime/periods, with conﬁdence of each of the estimated time periods. Obviously, the one\nwith highest conﬁdence is the most probable based on the language model. An example\nof the interface is shown in Fig. 1(a) and example of results are shown in Fig. 1(b-e).\nTo build a system for dating a document, we compare document contents with word\nstatistics and usages over time. The dating approach is based on the temporal language\nmodel presented in [1]. The intuition behind this approach is that, for a given docu-\nment with unknown timestamp, it is possible to ﬁnd the time partition that mostly over-\nlaps in term usage with the document. For example, if the document contains the word\n“tsunami” and corpus statistics shows this word was very frequently used in 2004/2005,\nit can be assumed that this time period is a good candidate for the document timestamp.\nThe model assigns a probability to a document according to word statistics over time.\nBy partitioning a document corpus into time partitions, it is possible to determine the\ntimestamp of a non-timestamped document di by computing a similarity score (NLLR)\nW.

The timestamp of the docu-\nment is the partition which maximizes the similarity score.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we outline the temporal\nlanguage models used in our approach. In Sect. 3 we describe our document dating\nprototype. Finally, in Sect. 4 we outline our proposed demo.\n2 Temporal Language Models\nTimestamp estimation is based on the statistic language model presented by de Jong,\nRode and Hiemstra [1]. This temporal language model is a variant of the time-based\nmodel in [4], based on a probabilistic model from [6]. The temporal language model\nassigns a probability to a time partition according to word usage or word statistics over\ntime.\nA document is modeled as di = {{w1,...,w n} , (ti,t i+1)} where ti <t i+1 and\n(ti,t i+1) is a temporal view of document which can be represented by a time partition\nassociated to its timestamp. A normalized log-likelihood ratio [3] is used to compute\nthe similarity between two language models. Given a partitioned corpus, it is possible to\ndetermine the timestamp of a non-timestamped documentdi by comparing the language\nmodel of di with each corpus partition pj using the following equation:\nScore(di ,p j )=\n∑\nw∈di\nP(w|di ) × log P(w|pj )\nP(w|C) (1)\nwhere C is the background model estimated on the entire collection and pj is a time\npartition. The timestamp of the document is the partition maximizing a score according\nto the equation above, and the conﬁdence Conf of the estimation is calculated as the\nlogarithm of the score of the highest ranked relative to the second ranked partition.\nIn [2] we presented improvements to the approach of [1], the most important being\ntemporal entropy, use of search statistics and adapted semantic-based preprocessing.\nWe use temporal entropy (TE) to weight terms differently depending on how well\na term is suitable for separating time partitions among overall time partitions and also\nindicates how important a term is in a speciﬁc time partition. Temporal entropy of a\nterm wi is given as follows:\nTE (wi)=1+ 1\nlog NP\n∑\np∈P\nP(p|wi) × log P(p|wi) (2)\nwhere P(pj |wi)= tf (wi ,pj )\n∑ NP\nk=1 tf (wi ,pk ) , NP is the total number of partitions in a corpus P,\nand tf(wi,p j ) is the frequency of wi in partition pj . Modifying the score in Equa-\ntion (1), each term w can be weighted with temporal entropy TE (w) as follows:\nScorete(di,p j )=\n∑\nw∈di\nTE (w) × P(w|di ) × log P(w|pj )\nP(w|C) (3)\nSearch statistics provided by Google Zeitgeist (GZ) can be integrated as an additional\nscore in order to increase the probability of a tentative time partition. GZ essentially\n740 N. Kanhabua and K. Nørv˚ ag\ngives statistics of trends of search terms, i.e., increasing and decreasing popularity. By\nanalyzing search statistics, we are able to increase the probability for a particular par-\ntition which contains top-ranked queries. The higher probability the partition acquires,\nthe more potential time candidate it becomes. GZ is integrated as an additional score\ninto Equation (1) in order to increase the probability of partition pj :\nScoregz (di ,p j )=\n∑\nw∈di\n(\nP(w|pj ) × log P(w|pj )\nP(w|C) + βGZ(pj ,w )\n)\n(4)\nwhere β is the weight for the GZ function (see [2] for more details on calculating GZ).\nIn order to further increase accuracy ofthe dating, we have also integratedsemantic-\nbased techniques into document preprocessing, i.e., part-of-speech tagging (POS), col-\nlocation extraction (COLL), word sense disambiguation (WSD), and concept extraction\n(CON).\n3 Document Dating System\nOur prototype implements the ideas from [2], and uses a web-based interface. It allows\nto estimate the date of different input formats (i.e., a ﬁle, an URL, or plain text) as shown\nby Fig. 1(a). Example inputs can be URL: “http://tsunami-thailand.blogspot.com” or\ntext: “the president Obama”. The user can se lect parameters: preprocessing (POS,\nCOLL, WSD, or CON), similarity score (NLLR, GZ or TE), and time granularity (1-\nmonth, 3-months, 6-months, or 12-months). Given an input to be dated, the system com-\nputes similarity scores between a given document/text and temporal language models.\nThe document is then associated with tentative time partitions or its likely originated\ntimestamps. The results can be displayed in two ways. First, a rank list of partitions\nis shown in an descending order according to their scores. Second, each tentative time\npartition is drawn in a timeline with its score as a height.\n4 Demo Outline\nIn the demo, we will present the features of our dating tool, including the impact of the\nvariants of our temporal language approach:\nBasic vs. advanced preprocessing:There is a trade-off among semantic-based prepro-\ncessing. We compare a basic preprocessing (POS only) to an advanced preprocessing\n(a combination of POS, COLL, WSD, and CON). As will be shown, basic used less\ntime, but gains a poorer quality than the advanced.\nHow GZ enhances scores: To improve the accuracy, we compute scores by using GZ\nin addition to NLLR. The correct time period (2004/12 to 2005/11) is raised from the\n7th rank in Fig. 1(b) to the 1st rank with higher conﬁdence in Fig. 1(c).\nTE as a trend: A term occurring in few partitions is weighted high by TE and it pro-\nvides high scores for partitions in which the term appears. Fig. 1(d-e) display trends of\nthe web page about “US presidential election” with and withoutTE respectively and TE\ngives higher scores for relevant periods (2000, 2004 and 2008).\nUsing Temporal Language Models for Document Dating 741\nFig. 1.
