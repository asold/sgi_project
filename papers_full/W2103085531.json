They depend on a single scalar function satisfying a non-linear Toda\nequation. When there is an extra rotational U(1) isometry, there exists an implicit change\nof variables mapping the latter to a Laplace equation, and consequently, to an electrostatic\nproblem. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the geometry of smooth and singular\nconﬁgurations with these symmetries at ﬁnite radius of curvature.\nUnlike the case of 1 /2 BPS conﬁgurations in Type IIB with SO(4) ×SO(4) symmetry\nwhere the precise boundary conditions imposed by regularity were explicitly spelled out in\n[1], a similar treatment of their eleven dimensional counterparts was still missing. There was\nno understanding of neither the electrostatic conﬁguration responsible for the asymptotics\nnor the boundary conditions describing the physical solutions to the Laplace equation. In\nthis paper we provide a precise answer to both questions, allowing us to state the precise\nboundary problem describing the most general smooth and singular conﬁgurations with\nthese symmetries and to compute their masses. Just as smooth translationally invariant\nconﬁgurations have a ﬁnite discrete set of conducting disks as their building blocks [2], the\nsame will be true for the rotationally invariant ones.\n1\nFirst, we study the vacuum conﬁgurations. AdS 4×S7 is described by a semi-inﬁnite line\ncharge density and a single conducting disk attached to it. The electrostatic problem is that\nof solving Laplace’s equation in the presence of a background potential, due to the line charge\ndensity, inducing some charge on the conducting disk, with the boundary condition that the\npotential at the disk is some given constant value. The latter is an integral equation with a\nunique solution found by Copson [3]. The potential at the disk is ﬁxed by regularity, whereas\nits size determines the AdS radius of curvature. AdS7×S4 has a similar structure but instead\nof a ﬁnite conducting disk, it involves an inﬁnite conducting plane. The electrostatic problem\ncan be solved by the method of images. The distance between the line charge density and\nthis plane determines the AdS 7 radius of curvature.\nA given conﬁguration allows an inﬁnite number of equivalent electrostatic descriptions\ndue to the existence of conformal invariance in the original LLM coordinates [1]. We describe\nthe eﬀect that these conformal transformations have on the electrostatic data describing a\nsingle geometry.\nExcited conﬁgurations are obtained either by moving the original conducting disk in the\nAdS4×S7 or by adding extra ﬁnite conducting disks. We identify the set of coupled integral\nequations dealing with the appropriate boundary conditions to this problem, but we only\ndiscuss the simplest example for such excited conﬁgurations.\nEven though we can not solve for the most general smooth conﬁgurations, we compute\ntheir masses. We do this by examining the electrostatic potential in a multipole expansion\nat large distances. Matching the asymptotic metric expansion with the one for the singular\nsuperstar conﬁgurations [4], whose mass is well-known, we obtain\nM4 = 1\n2L4\n∑\ni\ni∑\nj=1\nNj\n2 Ni\n5 , M 7 = 2\nL7\n∑\ni\ni∑\nj=1\nNj\n2 Ni\n5 . (1.1)\nwhere Md stands for the mass in an asymptotic AdS d with radius of curvature Ld. These\nexpressions are the ﬁnite curvature gravity analogues of similar results obtained in ﬁeld\ntheory, either by analysing the spectrum of half-BPS conﬁgurations [5, 6] in ABJM [7] or\nby considering the N →∞ limit in some matrix model dual formulations [8] associated to\ntaking the Penrose limit in the gravity description.\nThe singular type IIB superstar geometry was described in terms of a continuous distri-\nbution of rings and the origin of the singularity was interpreted in terms of coarse-graining\nof the quantum mechanical information characterising the quantum state in the fermionic\nphase space formulation of the system [9, 10]. We prove that the AdS 4×S7 and AdS7×S4\nsuperstars [4] are described in terms of continuous distributions of conducting disks. Any\nsuch distribution will describe a singular geometry, because the radial electric ﬁeld com-\nponent must vanish inside the continuous conductor. Geometrically, this forces both the\n5-sphere and 2-sphere shrink to zero size at the same time in a non-smooth way, while the\ntime coordinate becomes null. We develop a general boundary condition describing general\nsuperstar-like singular conﬁgurations in terms of the shape of the continuous boundary dis-\ntribution of disks. The connection between singular geometries and continuous conductors\nwas already pointed out in [11]. They used the statistical methods developed in [9], to iden-\ntify singular geometries dual to thermal/typical states in diﬀerent ensembles of half-BPS\n2\nstates. It would be interesting to identify a generic singular conﬁguration in terms of typical\nstates in ABJM. To achieve that one needs to understand the precise dictionary between the\nshape of the conductor and the properties of the quantum states in the ﬁeld theory.\n2 Regular conﬁgurations\nEleven dimensional half-BPS supergravity conﬁgurations invariant under an R ×SO(3) ×\nSO(6) isometry group are of the form [1]\nds2\n11 =e2λ[\nds2\n4 + 4dΩ2\n5 + y2e−6λdΩ2\n2\n]\n(2.1)\nds2\n4 = −4\n(\ny2e−6λ + 1\n)\n(dt+ v)2 + e−6λ\ny2e−6λ + 1\n[\ndy2 + eD(\ndx2\n1 + dx2\n2\n)]\n(2.2)\nG4 =F ∧dΩ2 (2.3)\nF =d\n[\n−4y3e−6λ(dt+ v)\n]\n+ 2 ∗3\n[\ne−Dy2\n(\n∂y\n1\ny∂yeD\n)\ndy+ y∂i∂yDdxi\n]\n(2.4)\ne−6λ = − ∂yD\ny(y∂yD−1), v i = 1\n2εij∂jD (2.5)\nwith the scalar function D= D(xi, y) i= 1,2 satisfying the non-linear Toda equation\n□2D+ ∂2\nyeD = 0 . (2.6)\nWe will study the subset of U (1) invariant conﬁgurations under rotational symmetry in\nthe x1 −x2 plane. In polar coordinates x1 + ıx2 = xeıβ, this corresponds to translations\nalong β. Toda’s equation (2.6) gets mapped to the Laplace’s equation [12]\n1\nρ2\n¨V + V′′= 0 , (2.7)\nunder the implicit change of variables\nρ2 =x2eD (2.8)\ny=ρ∂ρV = ˙V (2.9)\nlog x=∂ηV = V′ (2.10)\n(From now on any dot will stand for ρ∂p whereas any prime for ∂η). After the coordinate\ntransformation, the metric (2.1) is\nds2\n11 =\n(\n−\n˙V∆\n2V′′\n)1\n3\n[\n4 dΩ2\n5 −2V′′˙V\n∆ dΩ2\n2 + ds2\n4\n]\n, (2.11)\nds2\n4 = −2V′′\n˙V\n(\ndρ2 + dη2 + ρ2\n( ˙V′)2 −¨VV ′′dβ2\n)\n−4( ˙V′)2 −¨VV ′′\n∆ (dt+ v)2 , (2.12)\n3\nwhere\n∆ = (2 ˙V −¨V)V′′+ ( ˙V′)2 , v =\n(\n1 +\n˙V′\n¨VV ′′−( ˙V′)2\n)\ndβ.\nIt was already argued in [1] that the most general regular solution to (2.7) corresponds\nto a discrete distribution of conducting disks located at positions η = ηi with radia Ri and\ncharge density σi. Each disk can carry a certain number of M2-branes coming from the ﬂux\nquantisation condition [1, 2]\nN2 = 1\n16πG11TM2\n∫\nC7\n∗11G4 , (2.13)\nif there exists a smooth 7-cycle allowing us to compute the contribution from the i-th disk\nNi\n2 = 1\nπ3ℓ6\np\n∫\nDi\neDdx1dx2\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\ny=0\n= 2 ·2k\nπ2ℓ6\np\n∫ Ri\n0\nρ2∂ρ\n(\n∂ηVη→η+\ni\n−∂ηVη→η−\ni\n)\ndρ\n= −2 ·2k\nπ3ℓ6\np\nQi, (2.14)\nwith Qi = 2π\n∫Ri\n0 σiρdρ being its charge.

One can construct one such 4-cycle for each\nsegment between two consecutive disks located at ηi−1 = −di−1 and ηi = −di. The number\nof M5-branes Ni\n5 carried by such cycle is\nNi\n5 = 1\n2π2l3\np\n∫\nDi\ny−1eDdx1dx2\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\ny=0\n= 2k\nπℓ3\np\n∫ di\ndi+1\nρ\n∂ρV∂2\nηV\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\nρ=0\n= 2 ·2k\nπℓ3\np\n(di −di−1) . (2.16)\nTo compute both ﬂux integrals we parameterised the range of the compact variable β as\nβ ∼β+ 4kπ. We will review the construction of the 4-cycles and 7-cycles appearing in these\nintegrals in subsection 2.5 and postpone a discussion on the actual values that k can take\nuntil we have solved the electrostatics problem associated with the two vacuum conﬁgurations\nAdS4 ×S7 and AdS7 ×S4.\nOne important feature of the metric (2.1) is its invariance under general conformal trans-\nformations [1]\nω1 ≡x1 + ıx2 →f(ω1) , D →D−log\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\ndf\ndω1\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\n2\n. (2.17)\nWe will later comment on the action that the subset of these transformations preserving the\nU(1) invariance along ∂β have in the electrostatic description of these conﬁgurations.\n4\n2.1 The AdS4 ×S7 ground state\nThe metric of global AdS4 ×S7 is\nL−2\n4 ds2\n11 = −\n(\n1 + r2)\ndτ2 + r2 dΩ2\n2 + 1\n1 + r2 dr2 + 4\n(\ncos2 θdφ2 + dθ2 + sin2 θdΩ2\n5\n)\n. (2.18)\nwhere the AdS4 radius of curvature L4 = ℓp (π2 N2/2)1/6 is given in terms of an integer N2.\nDue to the existence of the conformal transformations (2.17), we know there must exist\nan inﬁnite number of ways of describing (2.18) in the original LLM coordinates {x, β, t}.\nOn the other hand, the product of the 2-sphere and 5-sphere radia ﬁxes the y coordinate\nuniquely\ny= L3\n4 r sin2 θ. (2.19)\nThe technical origin of this multiplicity can be seen, for example, from the matching of the\nr−θ and y−xplanes in (2.18) and in LLM coordinates. The latter does not determine the\nscalar function eD, which remains entirely undetermined. Once a particular eD is chosen, it\ndetermines x, and from that, the choice of U(1)’s is ﬁxed, modulo discrete transformations\nin {τ, φ}. For example, one can check that the choices\nx= L3\n4\n√\n1 + r2 cos2 θ, e D = tan2 θ, (2.20)\ndβ = 2dφ+ dτ, dt = −dφ (2.21)\nare a consistent possibility. The same is true for\nx=\n(\n1 + r2\n4\n)1/4\ncos θ, e D = 4L6\n4\n√\n1 + r2\n4 sin2 θ. (2.22)\nThe two mappings are related through the conformal transformation z1 = L3\n4 (ω1)2 where\n|z1|=\n√\n1 + r2 cos2 θ and |ω1|= (1 + r2/4)1/4 cos θ. (2.23)\nThis conformal transformation ﬁxes the relation between both angular variables, and con-\nsequently also explains the relation among both U(1)’s. In particular, if z1 = ˆxeiˆβ and\nω1 = xeiβ, then it is clear ˆβ ∼ˆβ+ 4π, whereas β ∼β+ 2π, since ˆβ = 2β. Thus, diﬀerent\nconformal frames correspond to diﬀerent U(1) embeddings and consequently to diﬀerent val-\nues of the constant k, even though the full ﬂux integrals are conformally invariant. Clearly,\nby considering conformal transformations of the form z1 ∝(ω1)n, which preserve the U(1)\ninvariant nature of the initial angular variable β, we could generate an inﬁnite number of\ndiﬀerent mappings indexed by the integer n. Diﬀerent mappings would correspond to dif-\nferent values of the constant k parameterising the range of the LLM compact coordinate β,\nthough all of them would describe the same number of M2-branes N2.\nNext, we would like to understand the electrostatic conﬁguration giving rise toAdS4 ×S7.\nUsing (2.8) and (2.20) ﬁxes ρ to be\nρ= L3\n4\n2\n√\n1 + r2 sin 2θ. (2.24)\n5\nRequiring the absence of cross-terms in the ρ−η plane ﬁxes\nη= −L3\n4\n2 rcos 2θ. (2.25)\nInverting these relations\nr2 = 1\n2L6\n4\n(\n−L6\n4 + 4(η2 + ρ2) + C\n)\n, cos 2θ= − η√\n2L3\n4 |η|\n(\nL6\n4 −4(η2 + ρ2) + C\n)1\n2 ,\nC =\n√\n16L6\n4η2 + (4η2 + 4ρ2 −L6\n4)2 , (2.26)\nallows us to relate both types of LLM coordinates as follows\ny= ρ∂ρV = 1\n2\n√\n2\n(\n−L6\n4 + 4η2 + 4ρ2 + C\n)1\n2 + η (2.27)\nlog x= ∂ηV = log\n[ 1\n2\n√\n2\n(\nL6\n4 + 4η2 + 4ρ2 + C\n)1\n2\n(\n1 − η√\n2L3\n4 |η|\n(\nL6\n4 −4η2 −4ρ2 + C\n)1\n2\n)]\n(2.28)\nThe AdS4×S7 electrostatics : One can check that the consistency relation∂ηy= ρ∂ρlog x\nholds everywhere, i.e. ρ∂ρηV = ρ∂ηρV. Furthermore, Laplace’s equation (2.7)\n1\nρ∂ρy+ ∂η log x= 0 (2.29)\nalso holds, but only away from certain regions where charge sources exist. This is what we\nstudy next.\nFirst, notice the electric ﬁeld ∂ρV in (2.27) diverges at η >0 and close to the axis ρ= 0.\nThis indicates the presence of a semi-inﬁnite line charge distribution λ(η) given by\nλ(η) = ρ∂ρV →\n{\n0 ,η <0\n2η ,η > 0 (2.30)\nSecond, the same electric ﬁeld ∂ρV vanishes along the disk located at η = 0 and with\nradius R = L3\n4\n2 , i.e. described by ρ < L3\n4\n2 . This deﬁnes a conducting disk whose surface\ncharge distribution σ(ρ) can be computed using the discontinuity of the derivative (2.28)\nacross η= 0 for ρ<L 3\n4/2 due to the factor η\n|η|\n∂ηVη→0+ = log\n[L3\n4\n2\n(\n1 −\n√\n1 −4L−6\n4 ρ2\n)]\n, ∂ ηVη→0− = log\n[L3\n4\n2\n(\n1 +\n√\n1 −4L−6\n4 ρ2\n)]\n,\nσ(ρ) = ∂ηVη→0+ −∂ηVη→0− = log\n[\n1 −\n√\n1 −4L−6\n4 ρ2\n1 +\n√\n1 −4L−6\n4 ρ2\n]\n. (2.31)\n6\nTo sum up, the geometry of the AdS4 ×S7 vacuum is encoded in terms of a semi-inﬁnite\nline charge distribution λ(η) (2.30) at ρ= 0 and a conducting disk located at η = 0 of size\nR= L3\n4\n2 with surface charge distribution σ(ρ) (2.31).\nWe can map this information to the LLM description through the coordinate transfor-\nmations (2.9) and (2.10). The line charge distribution at ρ= 0, η >0 is mapped to\nx= 0 , y = 2η. (2.32)\nThus, as we move along the line distribution towards smaller values of η, we move along the\naxis x= 0 towards the plane located at y = 0. The regions η →0± close to the conducting\ndisk are mapped to\ny= 0 , x = L3\n4\n2\n(\n1 ∓\n√\n1 −4L−6\n4 ρ2\n)\n. (2.33)\nThus, as we move along the disk for η →0+, x increases from 0 to L3\n4/2. If we move along\nthe disk for η→0−, x increases from L3\n4/2 to L3\n4 as we move from the rim towards the disk\naxis at ρ= 0. Finally, the segment at η <0, ρ= 0 where λ(η) vanishes is mapped to\ny= 0 , x = L3\n4\n√\n1 + 4L−6\n4 η2 . (2.34)\nIt is an interesting observation that the x = 0 axis corresponds to the set of points where\nthe U(1) circle shrinks smoothly. As soon as we reach the y= 0 plane, the region x∈[0, L3\n4]\ncorresponds to the set of points where the 2-sphere shrinks smoothly, whereas the region x>\nL3\n4 describes the points where the 5-sphere collapses smoothly. This structure is reminiscent\nof the one reported for 1/2 BPS conﬁgurations in type IIB [1].\nFirst principles derivation: Given the nonlinearity of the Toda equation, it is convenient\nto rederive the previous results by solving the Laplace equation in the presence of a line charge\ndistribution and a conducting disk before attempting to solve more complicated electrostatic\nconﬁgurations.\nIn general, a potential V reproducing (2.27) and (2.28) will satisfy Laplace’s equation in\nthe presence of some charge distribution q(η, ρ)\n1\nρ∂ρ(ρ∂ρV) + ∂2\nηV = σ(ρ,η) . (2.35)\nThus, its general solution is\nV = −1\n4π\n∫\nd3x′ σ(x′)\n|x −x′| (2.36)\nWe can rephrase the current electrostatic problem as follows : we have the line charge\ndistribution λ(η) (2.30) and a conducting disk at η = 0 of radius R = L3\n4\n2 . λ(η) produces a\npotential Vb, which we will think of as a background potential in which the conducting disk\nis placed. As a result, there will be some induced surface charge distribution σ(ρ) on the\ndisk, producing a potential Vd so that the total electrostatic potential equals\nV = Vd + Vb. (2.37)\n7\nThe background potential generated by the semi-inﬁnite line charge distribution λ(η) is\nformally given by\nVb = −1\n2\n∫ ∞\n0\n2η′\n√\nρ2 + (η−η′)2\ndη′. (2.38)\nThis integral diverges and requires regularization. We will use the freedom to shift the\npotential1 by linear terms in η to achieve a ﬁnite background potential\nVb = − lim\nL→+∞\n\n1\n2\n∫ L\n0\n2η′\n√\nρ2 + (η−η′)2\ndη′+ L+ η ln (2L)\n\n\n=\n√\nη2 + ρ2 + η log\n[\n−η+\n√\nη2 + ρ2\n]\n. (2.39)\nNotice this expression still satisﬁes (2.35).\nThe disk potential Vd is determined by the induced surface charge distribution σ(ρ)\nVd = −1\n4π\n∫ R\n0\nρ′dρ′\n∫ 2π\n0\ndφ′ σ(ρ′)√\nρ2 + ρ′2 −2ρρ′cos φ′+ η2\n, (2.40)\nwhere we already used the fact that we are dealing with U(1) invariant conﬁgurations.\nOur electrostatic problem deﬁnes a boundary problem since the total potential must be\na constant V0 on the surface of the conducting disk\nV0 = Vb(ρ,0) + Vd(ρ,0) , ρ<R = L3\n4\n2 . (2.41)\nNotice this condition deﬁnes an integral equation for the disk charge density σ(ρ).\nThis electrostatic problem was solved by Copson [3]. Speciﬁcally, he solved the elec-\ntrostatic problem of a conducting disk immersed in some external potential satisfying the\nboundary condition of keeping the potential at the disk equal to some continuous and dif-\nferentiable function f(ρ). In our situation,\nVd(ρ, 0) = V0 −ρ= f(ρ) , (2.42)\nCopson’s unique solution is given by\nS(ρ) = 1\n2π\n∂\n∂ρ\n∫ ρ\n0\ntf(t)√\nρ2 −t2\ndt, (2.43)\nσ(ρ) = 8\nρ\n∂\n∂ρ\n∫ R\nρ\ntS(t)√\nt2 −ρ2\ndt. (2.44)\n1The origin of this symmetry is the existence of the conformal symmetry in the initial LLM coordinates.\nSee subsection 2.3 for further comments.\n8\nComputing the integrals, we obtain\nS(ρ) = V0\n2π −1\n4ρ (2.45)\nσ(ρ) = −2 log\n(\nR+\n√\nR2 −ρ2\nρ\n)\n−\n(4V0\nπ −2R\n) 1√\nR2 −ρ2\n(2.46)\nRegularity will not allow an arbitrary disk potential value V0 but ﬁxes it to be\nV0 = πR\n2 . (2.47)\nIt is reassuring that this fact guarantees the vanishing of the surface charge density σ(ρ) at\nthe rim of the disk ρ= Rand as a result, the continuity of the ﬁrst derivative ∂ηV there. As\nwe will discuss later, the observation that regularity determines the value of the potential at\nthe disk seems to be generic.\nOur ﬁrst principle derivation assumed the disk was located at η= 0, but worked for any\ndisk radius R. Obviously, this last parameter will determine its charge Q\nQ= 2π\n∫ R\n0\nσ(ρ) ρdρ = −2πR2 . (2.48)\nSubstituting this charge in the ﬂux quantisation condition (2.14) ﬁxes R = L3\n4\n2 . With this\nchoice, we both reproduce the surface charge density (2.31) computed by the direct matching\nof metrics and match the quantisation condition (2.14) telling us the solution carriesN2 units\nof M2-brane ﬂux.\n2.2 The AdS7 ×S4 ground state\nThe ansatz (2.1) can also describe the AdS7 ×S4 vacuum\nds2\n11 = L2\n7\n[\n−\n(\n1 + r2)\ndτ2 + r2 dΩ2\n5 + 1\n1 + r2 dr2 + 1\n4\n(\ncos2 θdφ2 + dθ2 + sin2 θdΩ2\n2\n)]\n(2.49)\nwhere L7 = 2ℓp(πN5)1/3 is the AdS7 radius of curvature.\nThe matching of this geometry to the original LLM coordinates shares most of the com-\nments mentioned in the previous section. As an example of the inﬁnite set of such mappings,\nwe can give\ny= L3\n7\n8 r2 sin θ, x = L3\n7\n8\n(\n1 + r2)\ncos θ, e D = r2\n1 + r2 , (2.50)\ndτ = dt, dβ = −2 dt+ dφ. (2.51)\nIn this particular mapping, β ∼β+ 2π. Consequently, the parameter k entering in our ﬂux\nquantisation conditions will equal k= 1/2.\n9\nLet us describe this vacuum geometry in the electrostatics coordinates. Using (2.8) and\nanalysing the mapping from the r−θ plane to the ρ−η plane we can ﬁx the transformation\nto be\nρ= L3\n7\n8 r\n(\n1 + r2)1\n2 cos θ, η = L3\n7\n8\n(1\n2 + r2\n)\nsin θ. (2.52)\nInverting these,\nsin θ= 8√\n2L3\n7\n(L6\n7\n26 + 4\n(\nη2 + ρ2)\n−C\n1\n2\n)1\n2\n, (2.53)\ncos θ= 8√\n2L3\n7\n(L6\n7\n26 −4\n(\nη2 + ρ2)\n+ C\n1\n2\n)1\n2\n, (2.54)\nr2 = −1\n2 + 4√\n2L3\n7\n(L6\n7\n26 + 4\n(\nη2 + ρ2)\n+ C\n1\n2\n)1\n2\n, (2.55)\nC = L6\n7\n4 ρ2 +\n(L6\n7\n26 −4\n(\nη2 + ρ2))2\n. (2.56)\nWe now use these expressions along with (2.9) and (2.10) to learn about the electrostatic\npotential\nρ∂ρV =y= η− 1\n2\n√\n2\n(L6\n7\n26 + 4\n(\nη2 + ρ2)\n−C\n1\n2\n)1\n2\n. (2.57)\n∂ηV = lnx= ln\n[\n1\n2\n√\n2\n(\n1 + 23\n√\n2L3\n7\n(L6\n7\n26 + 4\n(\nη2 + ρ2)\n+ C\n1\n2\n)1\n2\n)(L6\n7\n26 −4\n(\nη2 + ρ2)\n+ C\n1\n2\n)1\n2\n]\n.\n(2.58)\nAs long as η >0 or {ρ >0 ,η > L3\n7\n16 }, the above potential satisﬁes both Laplace’s equation\nand the consistency condition\n1\nρ∂ρy+ ∂η log x= 0 ,\n∂ηy= ρ∂ρlog x. (2.59)\nAs for the AdS4 ×S7 conﬁguration, we now examine the location of sources. First,\nconsider the electric ﬁeld ∂ρV. From (2.57), we see that at η→0+ it vanishes\n∂ρVη→0+ = 0 , ∀ρ. (2.60)\nThis points out the existence of an inﬁnite conducting surface at η = 0. Its charge sur-\nface density σ(ρ) can be computed from the discontinuity in the electric ﬁeld ∂ηV at the\nconducting plane\nσ= ∂ηVη→0+ −∂ηVη→0− = log\n[\nL3\n7\n16 +\n√\nL6\n7\n28 + ρ2\n]\n. (2.61)\n10\nFurthermore, at ρ→0 and η >L3\n7\n16\nρ∂ρVρ→0 = η−L3\n7\n16 . (2.62)\nThus, the electric ﬁeld diverges in this region, and as for the AdS4 ×S7, we will interpret\nthis as due to the presence of a semi-inﬁnite line charge distribution\nλ(η) =\n{\n0 ,0 <η < L3\n7\n16\nη−L3\n7\n16 ,η >L3\n7\n16\n(2.63)\nlocated at ρ= 0.\nTo sum up, the geometry of the AdS7 ×S4 vacuum is encoded in terms of a semi-inﬁnite\nline charge distribution λ(η) (2.63) at ρ = 0 and an inﬁnite conducting plane located at\nη= 0 with surface charge density σ(ρ) (2.61).\nFirst principle derivation: Ignoring the inﬁnite plane, the background potential due to\n(2.63) and after appropriate regularization would equal :\nVb(ρ,η) = 1\n2\n\n\n√\nρ2 +\n(\nη−L3\n7\n16\n)2\n+\n(\nη−L3\n7\n16\n)\nlog\n\n−\n(\nη−L3\n7\n16\n)\n+\n√\nρ2 +\n(\nη−L3\n7\n16\n)2\n\n\n\n. (2.64)\nDue to the presence of the inﬁnite conducting plane at η = 0, we must modify the total\npotential to keep the value of the potential at the plane ﬁxed. This can be accomplished by\nusing the method of images. Thus, the total potential equals\nV =\n{\nVb(ρ,η) −Vb(ρ,−η) + V0, η >0\nV0, η < 0 , (2.65)\nwhere V0 is the potential at such inﬁnite plane. The potential V is constant below the\nconducting plane η <0 since that region is screened. Notice the perpendicular component\nof the electric ﬁeld ∂ηV is discontinuous along the η = 0 plane yielding an induced charge\ndensity\nσ= ∂ηVη→0+ −∂ηVη→0− = log\n[\nL3\n7\n16 +\n√\nL6\n7\n28 + ρ2\n]\n, (2.66)\nmatching (2.61).\nOne might think this non-zero charge distribution implies the existence of non-trivial\nM2-brane charge. But the only available cycle in our geometry is the four-cycle appearing\nin ﬁgure 1. Thus, AdS4 ×S7 carries no M2-brane ﬂux, whereas its M5-brane ﬂux will only\n11\nFigure 1: Surface which when ﬁbered over the round S2 gives the unique four-cycle of the\nAdS7 ×S4 background.\ndepend on the distance between the line and plane charge densities\nN5 = 2 ·2k\nπℓ3\np\nL3\n7\n24 . (2.67)\nThis reproduces the appropriate quantisation condition when k = 1/2, which is the right\nvalue for the embedding used in (2.51), since L7 = 2ℓp(πN5)1/3.\n2.3 Conformal symmetry action in the electrostatic variables\nBoth vacuum conﬁgurations are described in terms of semi-inﬁnite line charge distributions\nand ﬁnite (inﬁnite) conducting charged disks. Given the existence of the conformal symmetry\n(2.17), it is natural to wonder what the action of the subset of such transformations preserving\nthe U(1) invariance in our conﬁgurations is in their electrostatic description. Consider one\nsuch transformation\nz = λωn (2.68)\nwith λ= |λ|eiγ ∈C, n∈Z, z = ˆxeiˆβ and ω= xeiβ. By deﬁnition\nˆx= |λ|xn, ˆβ = nβ+ γ. (2.69)\nUsing the implicit change of coordinates (2.8)-(2.10) in both conformally related frames, we\nderive the relation\n∂ˆηˆV = n∂ηV + log|λ|, (2.70)\nwhere ˆV stand for the electrostatic potential in the z-frame. Conformal invariance of the\nmetric (2.17) implies\ne\nˆD = eD\nn2 |λ|2 x2(n−1) , (2.71)\n12\nallowing us to conclude ˆρ= ρ/n. Thus, disk sizes Ri are not invariant, but transform under\nthese transformations\nˆRi = Ri\nn . (2.72)\nRequiring Laplace’s equation (2.7) to transform homogeneously, we learn\n∂η\n∂ˆη = n, (2.73)\nwhere we used ∂2\nˆη ˆV = n∂η\n∂ˆη ∂2\nηV.\nA ﬁrst consequence of (2.73) is the non-invariance of the semi-inﬁnite line charge distri-\nbution since the latter was linear in η. Secondly, the potentials in both frames are related\nas\nˆV = V + η\nnlog |λ|= V + ˆη log |λ|. (2.74)\nNotice that forn= 1, this is precisely the symmetry transformation that we used to regularise\nthe background potentials in both vacuum conﬁgurations. Thirdly, since ρ∂ρ is invariant, y\nis invariant, as expected.\nSince the Laplace equation transforms, in the presence of charge density sources σi, these\nwill transform. If the latter are localised at η= ηi and since delta functions transform under\nthe conformal transformation, we conclude\nˆσi = nσi. (2.75)\nThis transformation law is consistent with the invariance of the ﬂux integrals. Consider the\nM5-brane ﬂux (2.16). If β ∼β + 4πk, then ˆk = nk. Thus, the product kηi is invariant.\nFurthermore, the relation between η and ˆη allows a constant shift, but the latter leaves\nthe M5-brane ﬂux invariant since this quantity only depends on the diﬀerences ηi −ηi−1.\nConsider the M2-brane ﬂux (2.14). Its invariance requires Qi = nˆQi. This is consistent with\nour transformation laws since\nnˆQi = n\n∫\nˆσˆρdˆρ=\n∫\nσρdρ = Qi. (2.76)\nThus, the electrostatic data characterising a given smooth U(1) invariant conﬁguration\nis not invariant under U(1) preserving conformal transformations. In particular, the slope of\nthe semi-inﬁnite line charge distribution, the location, size and charge density of the diﬀerent\ndiscrete disks are not invariant, but the individual quantised ﬂuxes are, and so their masses\nwill be.\nAdS7×S4 as a limit of AdS4×S7 : The electrostatic descriptions for both vacua are rather\nsimilar. They both involve a semi-inﬁnite line charge density and a conducting surface : a\ndisk of ﬁnite size for AdS 4×S7 and an inﬁnite plane for AdS 7×S4. It is natural to wonder\nwhether one can reproduce the second geometry from an appropriate inﬁnite charge limit of\nthe ﬁrst.\n13\nSince the embeddings we used for both geometries have diﬀerent U(1) periodicities, i.e.\ndiﬀerent values of k, we ﬁrst apply a conformal transformation to match these. This will\nmodify both the slope of the electrostatic and the charge densities according to\nλ(η) →kλ(η) , σ (ρ) →kσ(ρ) . (2.77)\nFurthermore, the location of the semi-inﬁnite line distribution in AdS 7×S4 is shifted from\nthe one in the AdS 7×S4. Thus, we also need to consider the shift η →η−L3\n7/16, which\nis compatible with (2.73). After these transformations, taking the R→∞ in the AdS4×S7\nconﬁguration, the disk charge density behaves like\nσ= −log (2R) + log\n(\nL3\n7\n16 +\n√\nL6\n7\n28 + ρ2\n)\n. (2.78)\nNotice the ﬁnite piece reproduces the AdS7 ×S4 charge density (2.61). As for the divergent\npiece, it modiﬁes the total potential by\nV = −1\n2 ln (2R) η+ Vreg , (2.79)\nwhere Vreg stands for the AdS7×S4 potential. The linear divergent term can be absorbed by\nan appropriate |λ|rescaling in (2.68).\nThus, there exists a formal connection between both vacuum conﬁgurations and the\nexistence of conformal transformations makes it more precise. Notice the above construction\ncan be done for any conducting disk located at an arbitrary η0. After the charge is sent to\ninﬁnity, we would only keep the region η >η0 as part of our spacetime.\n2.4 Regularity\nIn previous sections, we developed the geometry of the electrostatic problem describing two\ndiﬀerent vacuum conﬁgurations. The latter involve semi-inﬁnite line charge densities and\nconducting disks. In this section we examine the regularity of the metric (2.11) in regions\nclose to these disks where various derivatives of the potential V take their zeros or become\ninﬁnite close to their rims. We also examine the behaviour of the metric close to the ρ= 0\naxis where the linear charge distribution is non-zero. The generic electrostatic conﬁguration\nwe imagine having is a line charge distribution at ρ= 0\nλ(η) =\n{\n2kη ,η > 0\n0 ,η <0 (2.80)\nand N circular conductors of radii Ri at ηi <0 centered at ρ= 0.\nIn the following paragraphs we focus on four diﬀerent regions of the ( η,ρ) space. First,\nwe show the region ρ = 0, η >0 where the line charge distribution is reached is smooth.\nSecond, we study the semi-inﬁnite axis ρ= 0, η <0, η̸= ηi and show the 5-sphere smoothly\ndegenerates combining with the ρ coordinate to form the origin of R6. Third, we study the\nsurface close to the conducting disks, i.e. η ∼ηi and 0 < ρ < Ri and show the 2-sphere\ncombines with η to smoothly describe the origin of R3. Finally, we study the region close to\nthe rim of the disk, i.e. η∼ηi and ρ∼Ri, and show its smoothness.\n14\nRegularity close to the linear charge distribution ( U(1) shrinking): Consider the\nregion ρ→0 close to the charge density (2.80). In this case we have\n˙V →2kη, ˙V′→2k, ¨V →0 , (2.81)\nwhile V′′ and ˙V′ remain ﬁnite. The metric (2.11) is\nds2\n11 =\n(\n−\n˙V∆\n2V′′\n)1\n3\n[\n4 dΩ2\n5 −2V′′˙V\n∆ dΩ2\n2 + ds2\n4\n]\n(2.82)\nds2\n4 = −2V′′\n˙V\n(\ndρ2 + dη2 + ρ2 1\n4k2 dβ2\n)\n−16k2\n∆ (dt+ v)2 (2.83)\nv=\n(\n1 − 1\n2k\n)\ndβ (2.84)\n∆ =2 ˙VV ′′+\n(\n˙V′\n)2\n(2.85)\nwhich leads to a smooth combination 2 of ρand β to form R2. Of course, one needs to check\nthat V′′<0 and ∆ >0 for the above metric to be meaningful.\nRegularity at ρ= 0, away from the linear charge distribution (S5 shrinking): At\nη <0 and in the absence of sources, the potential V admits the series expansion\nV = f0 (η) + f1 (η) ρ2 + f2 (η) ρ4 + O(ρ6) (2.86)\nThe Laplace equation gives the relation\nf′′\n0 = −4f1 , (2.87)\nallowing us to write the scalar function ∆ as\n∆ = 4ρ4\n[\n−2f2f′′\n0 + (f′\n1)2\n]\n≡4ρ4 g(η) . (2.88)\nHence the metric approaches\nds2\n11 = g\n1\n3\n[\n4ρ2 dΩ2\n5 + 4dρ2 + (f′′\n0 )2\ng dΩ2\n2 + 4\n(\ndη2 + 1\n(f′′\n0 )2 dβ2\n)\n−(f′′\n0 )2\ng\n(\ndt+\n(\n1 − 2f′\n1\n(f′′\n0 )2\n)\ndβ\n)2]\n. (2.89)\nNotice for the latter to make sense one must check that\n(f′′′\n0 )2 >2f2 f′′\n0 (g >0) and f1 ̸= 0 . (2.90)\nIt is explicit that the 5-sphere shrinks to zero size smoothly by combining with ρto describe\nthe origin of R6.\n2By deﬁnition, the periodicity of is β ∼β+ 4kπ for ﬁnite integer k. Thus, β/(2k) has period 2 π and\nconsequently the ρ→0 limit describes the origin of R2 for any k.\n15\nRegularity on the disk surfaces ( S2 shrinking): In this subsection we consider the\narea ρ> 0 close to one of the conducting disks, i.e. η∼ηi. Without loss of generality we will\ntake η >ηi. Since there is some induced surface charge density on the disk, the potential V\nadmits the expansion\nV = V0 + V1 (ρ) (η−ηi) + 1\n6V2 (ρ) (η−ηi)3 + ··· (2.91)\nleading to the metric (2.11)\nds2\n11 =\n(\n−\n˙V3\n1\n2V2\n)1\n3 [\n4dΩ2\n5 −2V2\n˙V1\n(\n˜η2 dΩ2\n2 + d˜η2 + dρ2 + ρ2\n˙V2\n1\ndβ2\n)\n−4 (dt+ v)2\n]\n(2.92)\nv=\n(\n1 − 1\n˙V1\n)\ndβ, (2.93)\nwhere ˜η= η−ηi. The above shows how the 2-sphere combines with ˜η to smoothly form the\norigin of R3.\nRegularity close to the rim of a conducting disk: If we examine the region very\nclose to the rim of a disk of radius Ri locate at ηi, we can forget about its curvature.\nThe electrostatic problem is equivalent to that of a semi-inﬁnite conducting plane with\nsome boundary conditions. First, the induced charge distribution close to its edge vanishes.\nSecond, there exists a discontinuity in the ﬁrst derivative ∂ηV at η= ηi and ρ<R i. Third,\nthe electric ﬁeld ∂ρV vanishes on the semi-inﬁnite plane. The electrostatic potential V\nsatisfying all these conditions is\n∂ηV = qi\n2\nη−ηi\n|η−ηi|\n(\nRi −ρ+\n√\n(η−ηi)2 + (ρ−Ri)2\n)1/2\n+ ki + ··· (2.94)\n∂ρV = −qi\n2\n(\nρ−Ri +\n√\n(η−ηi)2 + (ρ−Ri)2\n)1/2\n+ ··· (2.95)\nfor some constants {qi,ki}. Using these along with the change of coordinates\nρ= Ri + 1\n2Ri\n(\nx2 −y2)\nη= ηi + Rixy, x> 0 , (2.96)\nthe metric (2.11) now reads\nq−2/3\ni ds2\n11 = 2RidΩ2\n5 + Ri\n[\ndx2 + x2 dΩ2\n2\n]\n+ Ridy2 + 4q−2\ni dβ2 −2Ri (dt+ dβ)2 (2.97)\nwhich is manifestly regular.\n16\n(a) A four-cycle\n (b) A seven-cycle\nFigure 2: Surfaces describing 4-cycles and 7-cycles giving rise to non-trivial ﬂuxes.\n2.5 Flux quantisation\nquantisation of ﬂuxes requires the identiﬁcation of smooth four- and seven-cycles in the\ngeometries. In general, we can think of an n+ 2 dimensional cycle as a disk ﬁbration over\nan n dimensional cycle. For example, consider the metric for an n+ 2 sphere\nds2\nn+2 = sin2 θdφ2 + dθ2 + cos2 θdΩ2\nn, 0 <θ <π/2 (2.98)\nθ = 0 describes the center of the ﬁbered disk with an S1 smoothly collapsing while at the\nrim of the disk θ= π/2 it is an n sphere that collapses smoothly.\nThus, the loci where lower dimensional cycles collapse smoothly in our geometries are\nnatural candidates to construct our four- and seven-cycles. Our regularity analysis showed\nthat 2-spheres smoothly collapse on the surface of the conducting disks, whereas 5-spheres do\nat the segments between the disks. Furthermore at the semi-inﬁnite charge line distribution,\nan S1 is smoothly collapsing too. These are the ingredients we will use to construct our\nsmooth cycles.\nMore speciﬁcally, to construct a four cycle, we consider a two dimensional surface inside\nthe three dimensional space spanned by ρ, η and β/2k as shown in ﬁgure 2. The two\ndimensional surface we consider is such that it intersects with the linear charge distribution\nonce where an S1 collapses and it ends on an S1 on one of our conducting disks where an S2\ncollapses.\nTo construct a seven-cycle we consider a closed two dimensional surface which doesn’t\nintersect with any conducting disk as shown in ﬁgure 2 but it surrounds a number of them.\nThe surface, as shown, intersects the ρ= 0 line at one point on the line charge distribution\nwhere again an S1 smoothly shrinks and at a point on a line segment between two disks\nwhere an S5 smoothly degenerates.\n17\nFigure 3: Deformed surface used to construct four- and seven-cycles. The seven-form integral\nreceives non-zero contribution only from the blue segments while the four-form integral\nreceives non-zero contribution from the red line segments.\nIn order to quantize the ﬂuxes of our solutions we need to integrate the four form over\nthe four cycles and its hodge dual seven-form over the seven-cycles using the quantisation\nconditions\nN2 = 1\n16πG11TM2\n∫\nC7\n∗11G4 (2.99)\nN5 = 1\n16πG11TM5\n∫\nC4\nG4 (2.100)\nSince the integrated four and seven forms are regular, we can continuously deform the surfaces\nclose to the ρ = 0 axis and the disks without changing the value of the integral. Observe\nthat (2.99) only receives non-zero contribution from the surfaces of the disks while (2.100)\nonly does from the ρ= 0 line segments as shown in ﬁgure 3.\nWe conclude that each disk contributes a number of M2-branes\nNi\n2 = 2 ·2k\nπ2ℓ6\np\n∫ Ri\n0\nρ2∂ρ\n(\n∂ηVη→η+\ni\n−∂ηVη→η−\ni\n)\ndρ= −2 ·2k\nπ3ℓ6\np\nQi (2.101)\nwhile each segment between two consecutive disks contributes a number of M5-branes\nNi\n5 = 2k\nπℓ3\np\n∫ di\ndi+1\nρ\n∂ρV∂2\nηV\n⏐⏐⏐⏐\nρ=0\n= 4k\nπℓ3\np\n(di −di−1) . (2.102)\nThese arguments also apply for the vacuum conﬁgurations. In particular, notice the AdS7×S4\ndoes not carry M2-brane ﬂux despite having a non-vanishing charge density because there\nis no smooth ﬁnite size 4-cycle available.\n18\n2.6 Excited states: the conducting disk problem\nWe want to construct more general solutions to (2.7) with suitable boundary conditions to\nbe interpreted as excitations over AdS 4×S7 and AdS7×S4. We ﬁrst discuss the extension of\nthe single disk conﬁguration to an excited state. We then move to describe the mathematical\nproblem determining a multiple disk conﬁguration.\nSingle conducting disk: The single conducting disk is parameterised by its location η0,\nits radius R and the value of the potential on it V0. AdS 4×S7 is a particular case where\nη0 = 0, V0 = πR/2 and R determines the radius of AdS 4. From our cycle discussion, it\nis clear the reason why this single disk has no energy is because there is no 4-cycle giving\nrise to M5-brane ﬂux. If we want to construct a conﬁguration with non-vanishing energy all\nwe have to do is to move down the location of the disk to an arbitrary η0 <0, keeping the\nbackground potential Vb. This is the conﬁguration we study next.\nThe boundary problem is the same as for AdS 4×S7, since there is a single conducting\ndisk, but the continuous and diﬀerentiable function appearing in Copson’s solution now\nequals f(ρ) = V0 −Vb(ρ,η0) where\nVb(ρ, η0) =\n√\nη2\n0 + ρ2 + η0 log\n[\n−η0 +\n√\nη2\n0 + ρ2\n]\n. (2.103)\nEquation (2.43) yields\nSη0 (ρ) = V0 + kη0\n2π − k\n8π\n[\nπρ+ 2ρ tan−1\n(η0\n2ρ − ρ\n2η0\n)\n+ 2η0 ln\n[\n4\n(\nη2\n0 + ρ2)]]\n(2.104)\nwhich reproduces S0 = V0\n2π −k\n4 ρ in the limit η0 →0−.\nUsing the above expression in (2.44) we ﬁnd an integral over ρ which cannot be easily\nevaluated but we will write\nση0 =\n∫ η0\n0\n∂η0 ση0 + σ0 (2.105)\nyielding\nση0 = 4\nπ\n(\nR tan−1\n(η0\nR\n)\n+ η0\n2 ln\n[\n4\n(\nη2\n0 + R2)]\n−V0\nk −η0 + π\n2 R\n) 1√\nR2 −ρ2\n−2 ln\n(\nR+\n√\nR2 −ρ2\nρ\n)\n−4\nπ\n∫ η0\n0\n1√\nη2 + ρ2\ntan−1\n(√\nR2 −ρ2\nη2 + ρ2\n)\ndη (2.106)\nRequiring continuity in ∂ηV at the rim of the disk ρ= R ﬁxes the disk potential V0 to be\nV0 = R tan−1\n(η0\nR\n)\n+ η0\n2 ln\n[\n4\n(\nη2\n0 + R2)]\n−η0 + π\n2 R, (2.107)\n19\nsince the last integral is continuous. Thus, after integration by parts, we can write the charge\ndensity as\nση0 = −2 log\n(\nR+\n√\nR2 −ρ2\n)\n+ 2 logρ\n(\n1 −2\nπtan−1\n(√\nR2 −ρ2\nρ\n))\n+ 4\nπlog\n(\n−η0 +\n√\nη2\n0 + ρ2\n)\ntan−1\n(√\nR2 −ρ2\nη2\n0 + ρ2\n)\n+ 4\n√\nR2 −ρ2\nπ\n∫ η0\n0\nlog\n(\n−η+\n√\nη2 + ρ2\n) η\n(R2 + η2)\n√\n(η2 + ρ2)\ndη. (2.108)\nWe can also evaluate the two non-trivial ﬂuxes. The M5-brane ﬂux equals\nN5 = 2\n√\n2N2\n−η0\nL3\n4\n⇔ −2η0\nL3\n4\n= N5√2N2\n. (2.109)\nThus, the location of the disk η0 is ﬁxed, in units of the AdS4 radius, in terms of the ﬂux ratio\nN5/√N2. The total induced charge Q(η0, R) for any solution to the Copson electrostatic\nproblem, using equations (2.43) and (2.44), is given by\nQ= 2π\n∫ R\n0\nρdρσ (ρ) = −16π\n∫ R\n0\nS(ρ) dρ= −8\n∫ R\n0\nt√\nR2 −t2 f(t) dt. (2.110)\nFor the current case, this equals\nQ=2η2\n0π−4η0R−3πR2 + 2R2 tan−1\n(η0\n2R − R\n2η0\n)\n+ 4η2\n0 tan−1\n(η0\nR\n)\n+ 8η2\n0 tan−1\n(R\nη0\n)\n−8R2 tan−1\n(η0\nR\n)\n. (2.111)\nSince the solution is asymptotic to AdS 4×S7 with radius of curvature given by L4, the total\ninduced charge Q must satisfy\n−Q(η0, R)\nL6\n4\n= π\n2 , (2.112)\nwhich determines the size of the disk R.\nThe multi-conducting disk problem: The most general excited conﬁguration in AdS4×S7\nwill be characterized by a background potential Vb associated with the semi-inﬁnite line\ncharge density λ(η) and by a ﬁnite set of conducting disks located at η = ηi with radia Ri.\nThe background potential Vb will induce some charge density σi(ρ) on each of them, that\nwill determine the disk potential Vdi. The electrostatic potential solving our problem is\nV = Vb(ρ, η) +\n∑\ni\nVdi(ρ, η) , (2.113)\n20\nsubject to the set of boundary conditions\nV0i = Vb(ρ, ηi) +\n∑\nj\nVdj (ρ, ηi) . (2.114)\nThere are as many boundary conditions as conducting disks. They provide a set of coupled\nintegral equations for the charge densities σi(ρ). We expect the constant values V0i will be\nﬁxed by requiring the continuity of the electric ﬁeld ∂ηV at the rim of each of the disks. The\nsolution to such problem would provide the entire set of classical smooth conﬁgurations with\nAdS4×S7 asymptotics.\nThere is an extension of this problem for excited states over the AdS7×S4 vacuum. In this\ncase, there is also a background potential Vb due to a semi-inﬁnite line charge distribution\nand a collection of conducting disks. Using the method of images will take care of the\nboundary condition due to the inﬁnite plane. Thus, the relevant electrostatic potential will\nbe\nV =\n{\nVb(ρ,η) −Vb(ρ,−η) + ∑\ni(Vdi(ρ, η) −Vdi(ρ, −η)) + V0, η >0\nV0, η < 0 . (2.115)\nAs before, there exist as many boundary conditions\nV0i = Vb(ρ,ηi) −Vb(ρ,−ηi) +\n∑\nj\n(\nVdj (ρ, ηi) −Vdj (ρ, −ηi)\n)\n+ V0 , (2.116)\nas ﬁnite conducting disks, giving rise to a coupled set of integral equations to determine the\ncharge densities σj on each disk.\n2.7 Mass for asymptotically AdS4 ×S7 conﬁgurations\nThe general multi-ring conﬁguration asymptotic to AdS4 ×S7 is described by an electrostatic\npotential\nV =Vb +\n∑\ni\nVdi =\n√\nη2 + ρ2 + η log\n(\n−η+\n√\nη2 + ρ2\n)\n− 1\n4π\n∑\ni\n∫ Ri\n0\nρ′dρ′\n∫ 2π\n0\ndφ′ σi(ρ′)√\nρ2 + ρ′2 −2ρρ′cos φ′+ (η−η′\ni)2\n(2.117)\nsatisfying the boundary conditions (2.114).\nEven though we do not know the explicit mathematical solution to the boundary problem,\none suspects the mass of the conﬁguration should be determined by the ﬁrst subdominant\ncontribution in a multipole expansion of the full potential. Let us keep the lowest order\nterms in this expansion\nV =\n[√\nη2 + ρ2 + η log\n(\n−η+\n√\nη2 + ρ2\n)]\n− F\n(η2 + ρ2)\n1\n2\n−P η\n(η2 + ρ2)\n3\n2\n+ ··· (2.118)\n21\nwhere we deﬁned\nF = 1\n4π\n∑\ni\nQi = Q\n4π, (2.119)\nP = 1\n4π\n∑\ni\nηiQi = −1\n4π\n∑\ni\ndiQi = π3l9\np\n64\n∑\ni\ni∑\nj=1\nNj\n2 Ni\n5 . (2.120)\nF is related to the total charge of the conﬁguration and P is the η component of the dipole\nmoment.\nInstead of attempting a ﬁrst principle calculation of the mass, we will match the asymp-\ntotic expansion of the general multi-ring conﬁguration with the asymptotic expansion of the\nAdS4 ×S7 half-BPS superstar. The latter has an eleven dimensional metric\nds2\n11 = ∆2/3\n[\n−f4\nH4\ndt2 + dr2\nf4\n+ r2 dΩ2\n2 + (2L4)2 dθ2\n]\n+ ∆−1/3 4L2\n4\n[\nsin2 θdΩ2\n5 + H4 cos2 θ\n(\ndφ1 + a1\ndt\n2L4\n)2]\n, (2.121)\nwhere ∆ = 1 + q4 sin2 θ/r, a1 = −q4/(r+ q4), H4 = 1 + q4/r and f4 = 1 + r2 H4/L2\n4. Its\nasymptotic expansion at inﬁnity equals\nds2\n11 =ds2\n2 +\n(\n1 + 2\n3\nq4\nr sin2 ϑ\n)\nr2dΩ2\n2 + 4L2\n4 sin2 ϑ\n(\n1 −1\n3\nq4\nr sin2 ϑ\n)\ndΩ2\n5\nL2\n4\n(\n1 + q4\nr\n(2\n3 sin2 ϑ−1\n))dr2\nr2 + 4L2\n4\n(\n1 + q4\nr\n2\n3 sin2 ϑ\n)\ndϑ2 , (2.122)\nwhile its mass M4 is given by [13]\nM4 = q4\n4G4\n= (2L4)7\n3 ·26 ·π3ℓ9\np\nq4 , (2.123)\nwhere we usedG4 = G11\nVS7\n= 3\nπ4(2L4)7 G11 and G11 = 16π7ℓ9\np. Since the mass is determined by the\nAdS4 radius of curvatureL4 and the chargeq4, all we have to do is to match the asymptotics of\nthe LLM metric with (2.122), and determine a dictionary between the multipole parameters\n{F, P}and {L4, q4}.\nSince the asymptotic LLM metric is AdS4 ×S7, the natural coordinates to use in the\nasymptotic expansion of the full metric derived out of the potential expansion (2.118) are\nη= −L3\n4\n2 Rcos 2θ, ρ = L3\n4\n2\n√\n1 + R2 sin 2θ, R →∞ (2.124)\nComparing the lowest order contributions from both metrics determines F as a function of\nL4\nF = −L6\n4\n8 . (2.125)\n22\nUsing this in the expansion gives\nds2\n11 =\n(\n1 −32P\nL9\n4R(1 + 2 cos 2θ)\n)\nR2dΩ2\n2 + 4L2\n4 sin2 θ\n(\n1 + 16P\nL9\n4R(1 + 2 cos 2θ)\n)\ndΩ2\n5\nL2\n4\n(\n1 + 16P\nL9\n4R(1 + 2 cos 2θ)\n)dR2\nR2 + 4L2\n4\n(\n1 + 16P\nL9\n4R(1 + 2 cos 2θ)\n)\ndθ2\n+\n(\n−4R2 + 128PR\nL9\n4\n(1 + 2 cos 2θ)\n)(\ndt+ 1\n2dβ\n)2\n(2.126)\n+ cos2 θ\n(\nL2\n4 + 16 P\nL7\n4R (1 + 2 cos 2θ)\n)\nDβ2\nDβ =dβ−2\n(\n1 −48P\nL9\n4R\n)(\ndt+ 1\n2dβ\n)\n(2.127)\nTo compare with (2.122), we need to consider both the further change of coordinates\nR= r\nL4\n+ 48 P\nL8\n4\ncos2 ϑ, θ = ϑ−12 P\nL8\n4 r sin 2ϑ. (2.128)\nand the same identiﬁcation of U(1)’s as in (2.21), to read oﬀ the four dimensional gauge ﬁeld\na1 correctly. After these, we reproduce (2.122) when the relation\nq4 = 48 P\nL8\n4\n(2.129)\nis satisﬁed. Thus, we conclude the mass of the multi-ring conﬁguration asymptotic to\nAdS4×S7 is given by\nM4 = 1\n2L4\n∑\ni\ni∑\nj=1\nNj\n2 Ni\n5 . (2.130)\nEven though we used a speciﬁc conformal frame to do our metric expansion matching, the re-\nsult is conformally invariant since we proved all ﬂuxes are invariant under the transformations\n(2.17). This result reproduces the saturation of the BPS bound derived from superalgebra\nconsiderations\n∆4 ≡M4 L4 = 1\n2 J, (2.131)\nwhere J stands for the U(1) R-charge. The factor of 1 /2 is consistent with the conformal\ndimension of an scalar ﬁeld in three dimensions. This result is consistent with the microscopic\nconsiderations following the analysis of the moduli space of half-BPS conﬁgurations [5, 6] in\nABJM [7]. It is also consistent with the matrix model dual descriptions [8] available in the\nlimit N →∞, though our derivation is valid for ﬁnite N.\n2.8 Mass for asymptotically AdS7 ×S4 conﬁgurations\nWe follow the same strategy here as in the previous section. First, we expand the total\nelectrostatic potential\nV (ρ,η) =\n{\nVb(ρ,η) −Vb(ρ,−η) + Vd(ρ,η) −Vd(ρ,−η) + V0 , η >0\nV0 , η < 0 (2.132)\n23\nwhere the background potential Vb(η,ρ) is given by (2.64) and\nVd(η,ρ) = −1\n4π\n∑\ni\n∫ Ri\n0\n∫ 2π\n0\nρ′dρ′dφ′ σi(ρ′)\n(\nρ′2 + ρ2 −2ρ′ρcos φ′+ (η−ηi)2)1\n2\n(2.133)\ncorresponds to the sum of the potentials due to each disk located at η= ηi >0, with surface\ncharge density σi solving the integral equation\nV (ρ,ηi) = Vi, ρ<R i (2.134)\nand vanishing on the disk rim.\nWhen performing the multipole expansion, there will be no point charge contribution\ndue to the cancellation caused by the mirror charge. Thus the dominant contribution to the\npotential will be the dipole term\nV (ρ,η) = Vb(ρ,η) −Vb(ρ,−η) −2P η\n(η2 + ρ2)\n3\n2\n+ ··· (2.135)\nP = 1\n4π\n∑\ni\nηiQi = −π3l9\np\n24\n∑\ni\ni∑\nj=1\nNj\n2 Ni\n5 (2.136)\nQi = 2π\n∫ Ri\n0\nρdρσi (2.137)\nwhere we used the quantisation conditions (2.14) and (2.16). Notice the ﬂip of sign in the\nvalue of such dipole. This is due to the location of the disks being at positive ηi.\nInstead of attempting a ﬁrst principle calculation of the mass, we will match the asymp-\ntotic expansion of the general multi-ring conﬁguration with the asymptotic expansion of the\nAdS7 ×S4 half-BPS superstar. The latter has an eleven dimensional metric\nds2\n11 = ˜∆1/3\n[\n−f7\nH7\ndt2 + dr2\nf7\n+ r2 dΩ2\n5 + L2\n7\n4 dϑ2\n]\n+ L2\n7\n4\n˜∆−2/3\n[\nsin2 ϑdΩ2\n2 + H7 cos2 ϑ\n(\ndφ1 + a1\ndt\nL7\n)2]\n, (2.138)\nwith ˜∆ = 1 +q7 sin2 ϑ/r4, H7 = 1 +q7/r4, a1 = 2H−1\n7 and f7 = 1 +r2H7/L2\n7. Its asymptotic\nexpansion at inﬁnity equals\nds2\n11 =ds2\n2 + r2\n(\n1 + q7\n3r4 sin2 ϑ\n)\ndΩ2\n5 + L2\n7\n4\n(\n1 + q7\n3r4 sin2 ϑ\n)\ndϑ2\n+ L2\n7\n4 sin2 ϑ\n(\n1 −2q7\n3r4 sin2 ϑ\n)\ndΩ2\n2 +\n(L2\n7\nr2 −L4\n7\nr4 + L6\n7\nr6 + 4q7\n3r6\n(\nsin2 ϑ−3\n))\ndR2 ,\n(2.139)\nwhere ds2\n2 stands for the two dimensional metric in the t−φplane. Its mass M7 is given by\n[13]\nM = π2\n4G7\nq7 = L4\n7\n3 ·27π3ℓ9\np\nq7 (2.140)\n24\nwhere we used G7 = G11\nVS4\n= 6\nπ2L4\n7\nG11 and G11 = 16π7ℓ9\np. Since the mass is determined by the\nAdS7 radius of curvatureL7 and the chargeq7, all we have to do is to match the asymptotics of\nthe LLM metric with (2.139), and determine a dictionary between the multipole parameters\nP and {L7, q7}.\nSince the asymptotic LLM metric is AdS7 ×S4, the natural coordinates to use in the\nasymptotic expansion of the full metric are\nρ= L3\n7\n8 R\n√\n1 + R2 cos θ, η = L3\n7\n8\n(1\n2 + R2\n)\nsin θ, R →∞ (2.141)\nPerforming the expansion, the metric is\nds2\n11 =L2\n7\n[\nR2\n(\n1 + 210 P\nL9\n7R4 (1 + 5 cos (2θ))\n)\ndΩ2\n5 + sin2 θ\n4\n(\n1 −211 P\nL9\n7R4 (1 + 5 cos (2θ))\n)\ndΩ2\n2\n]\n+ L2\n7\n4\n(\n1 −211 P\nL9\n7R4 (1 + 5 cos (2θ))\n)[\ndθ2 + 1\nR2\n(\n1 − 1\nR2 + 1\nR4\n)\ndR2\n]\n+\n(\n−L2\n7R2 −L2\n7 −210 P\nL7\n7R2 (1 + 5 cos 2θ)\n)\ndt2 (2.142)\n+ cos2 θ\n(L2\n7\n4 −211 P\nL7\n7R4 (1 + 5 cos 2θ)\n)\nDβ2\nDβ =dβ+ 2\n(\n1 + 3 ·212 P\nL9\n7R4\n)\ndt. (2.143)\nTo match the asymptotic metric (2.139) we perform the further change of coordinates\nRL7 = r+ q7\n4r3 cos2 ϑ θ = ϑ− q7\n4r4 sin 2ϑ, (2.144)\nand identify the U(1)’s as in (2.51) but in appropriate units, i.e. dβ = dφ− 2\nL7\ndτ, dt= dτ\nL7\n.\nThis allows us to identify the relation\nq7 = −3 ·212P\nL5\n7\n, (2.145)\nfrom which we conclude the mass M7 is\nM7 = 2\nL7\n∑\ni\ni∑\nj=1\nNj\n2 Ni\n5 . (2.146)\nThis reproduces the saturation of the BPS bound derived from superalgebra considerations\n∆7 ≡M7 L7 = 2J, (2.147)\nwhere J stands for the U(1) R-charge. The factor of 2 is consistent with the conformal\ndimension of an scalar ﬁeld in six dimensions. Our derivation at ﬁnite N is consistent with\nthe matrix model dual descriptions [8] available in the limit N →∞.\n25\n3 Engineering superstar-like singular conﬁgurations\nRegular conﬁgurations are characterised by a ﬁnite set of discrete conducting disks satisfying:\nﬁrst, the electrostatic potential is some ﬁxed constant on each disk; second, the charge density\nvanishes on the rim of each disk, so that ∂ηV is continuous there; and third, ˙V vanishes on\neach disk. When the distance between conducting disks is sent to zero, one is dealing with a\ncontinuous distribution whose boundary shape is described by a curveR= R(η) determining\nthe radius of the given disk in the limit, i.e. 0 ≤ρ ≤R(η), for the disk located at η. We\ncan infer what the boundary conditions should be using electrostatics. ˙V must vanish inside\nthe conductor, whereas ∂ηV must remain continuous across its boundary. Notice the charge\ndistribution is no longer localised at discrete values of η = ηi, but becomes an η varying\nfunction. Indeed, denoting such charge distribution by d(η,ρ), using Laplace’s equation and\nthe conditions described above, we conclude ∂ρd= 0 and consequently\nd(η) = ∂2\nηVd, (3.1)\nwhere Vd is the potential on the disk.\nThe vanishing of ˙V at the boundary of the continuous conductor is responsible for the\nappearance of a singularity. Indeed, the metric (2.11) will be singular because both the round\n5-sphere and 2-sphere will shrink to zero size in a non-smooth way, the time coordinate will\nbecome null while the η, ρ metric components will blow up. The connection between this\nkind of singularities and continuous distributions of conducting disks was already emphasised\nin [11]. It is interesting that the emergence of this kind of singularity has its origin in losing\nthe information about the precise distribution of discrete disks. This is reminiscent of the\nphysics reported in [9] and motivated most of the comments in [11].\nIn this section, we will ﬁrst embed the half-BPS AdS4×S7 and AdS7×S4 superstars [4] in\nthe LLM ansatz. We will describe the electrostatic set-up responsible for these conﬁgurations\nand identify the shape of the boundary of the continuous disk distribution responsible for\ntheir singularities. We will check our interpretations by computing the charges of both con-\nﬁgurations using our derived charge densitiesd(η). Having understood these particular cases,\nwe will describe the boundary problem describing the most general singular conﬁguration of\nthis kind in terms of an arbitrary boundary curve R(η).\n3.1 AdS 4×S7 superstar\nThe asymptotically AdS4 ×S7 half-BPS superstar is an eleven dimensional supergravity\nconﬁguration with metric given in (2.121). The solution depends on two parameters : L4\nthe radius of AdS4 and q4 which determines its mass and R-charge through (2.123). Its\nmicroscopic interpretation is in terms of a distribution of giant gravitons over the 7-sphere\n[14]. The latter is consistent with the ﬂux quantisation condition\nq4\nL4\n= N5√2N2\n, (3.2)\nproviding the number of M5-branes supporting this conﬁguration.\n26\nMatching LLM: First, we embed (2.121) in the class (2.11). Focusing on the subspace\nspanned by the transverse 5-sphere, the 2-sphere in AdS4 and the r−ϑplane, we can rewrite\n(2.121) as\nds2\n11 = ds2\n2 + (2L4)2 sin2 ϑ\n4∆\n1\n3\n[ 4∆r2\n(2L4)2 sin2 ϑdΩ2\n2 + 4dΩ2\n5 + 4∆\nsin2 ϑ\n( dr2\n(2L4)2 f4\n+ dϑ2\n)]\n, (3.3)\nwhere ds2\n2 corresponds to the 2-dimensional metric in the t−φ1 plane. To match both\nmetrics, we consider the coordinate transformation\nρ= 1\n2 w(r) sin (2ϑ) , η = −1\n2 h(r) cos (2ϑ) + s (3.4)\nfor some constant s. Requiring the cross-term metric component drdϑ to vanish ﬁxes\nw(r) =\n√\nh(r)2 + c (3.5)\nwhere cis a constant of integration. On the other hand, the ρ−η conformal metric in (2.11)\nsatisﬁes\ndρ2 + dη2 =\n(\nh2 + ccos2 (2ϑ)\n)\n(\ndϑ2 + 1\n4\nh′2\nh2 + c dr2\n)\n. (3.6)\nSince the ratio of the two metric components equals (2 L4)2 f4, we derive\nh(r) = L2\n4\n(\nr+ q4\n2\n)\n, w (r) = L2\n4\n(\nr2 + rq4 + L2\n4\n)1\n2 . (3.7)\nThus, the coordinate transformation (3.4) is\nρ=L2\n4\n2\n(\nr2 + rq4 + L2\n4\n)1\n2 sin (2ϑ) , (3.8)\nη= −L2\n4\n2\n(\nr+ q4\n2\n)\ncos (2ϑ) + s. (3.9)\nOn the other hand, the 5-sphere and 2-sphere warp factors determine the equation for the\npotential V\n˙V = ρ∂ρV = L2\n4 r sin2 ϑ. (3.10)\nThe way to ﬁx the constant sis to use the asymptotics of the metric. The latter is AdS 4×S7\nand we know it supports a semi-inﬁnite line charge distribution λ(η) = 2ηat ρ= 0 for η >0,\nbut vanishes for η <0. This location requires ϑ= π/2. To make sure the line distribution\nends at η= 0, s must equal s= −q4L2\n4/4. Thus, the ﬁnal coordinate transformation is\nρ=L2\n4\n2\n(\nr2 + rq4 + L2\n4\n)1\n2 sin (2ϑ) , (3.11)\nη= −L2\n4\n2\n(\nr+ q4\n2\n)\ncos (2ϑ) −q4\nL2\n4\n4 . (3.12)\nTo interpret the conducting disk distribution supporting this conﬁguration, we will ex-\namine the locations where ˙V vanishes. Since ϑ∈[0, π\n2 ], this occurs either for ϑ= 0 or r= 0.\n27\nThe ϑ = 0 region corresponds to ρ = 0 and η <−q4 L2\n4\n2 . There is no charge density in this\nregion because the potential is continuous. The r= 0 region describes the ellipsis\nρ2\n(2L4)2 +\n(\nη+ q4L2\n4\n4\n)2\nq2\n4\n=\n(L2\n4\n4\n)2\n. (3.13)\nThis can be interpreted as a continuous distribution of conducting disks at locations ηin the\ninterval η∈\n[\n−q4L2\n4\n2 , 0\n]\nwith radii R(η) determined by\nR(η)2\n(2L4)2 +\n(\nη+ q4L2\n4\n4\n)2\nq2\n4\n=\n(L2\n4\n4\n)2\n. (3.14)\nWe will test this interpretation below, when we compute the charge density for this contin-\nuous distribution and the charges carried by the conﬁguration.\nTo ﬁnish the matching, we must determine ∂ηV. This can be achieved by determining\nx(r,ϑ). Consider the x−y plane. The y coordinate is already determined by (3.10) since\ny= ˙V. Consider the ansatz\nx= L2\n4 µ(r) cos ϑ. (3.15)\nPlugging in the metric (2.1) and demanding no cross-term between r and ϑ we obtain\neD = sin2 ϑ 2r\nµµ′ (3.16)\nleading to\ndy2 + eDdx2 = 4L4\n(1\n4 sin2 (2ϑ) + r µ\n2µ′sin4 ϑ\n)(\ndϑ2 + 1\n2r\nµ′\nµdr2\n)\n(3.17)\nand after comparing with (3.3) we have the equation\n(log µ)′= 1\n2\nr\nr2 + rq4 + L2\n4\n(3.18)\ndetermines µ. We see that we will have an integration constant which represents the sym-\nmetry of (2.1) scaling the x, β and at the same time shifting D. On the other hand the\nmeaning of the constant k is demonstrated in the the coordinates transformation of x and\ny, it represents the general conformal symmetry of the metric (2.1) of the xi plane.\nCharge density: the previous discussion determines the size of the disks in terms of their\nlocations, but not their charges. Instead of solving the boundary value problem, we notice\nthat the potential inside the ellipsis Vin only depends on η. This is because its interior\ncontains a distribution of conducting disks requiring\n∂ρVin = 0 (3.19)\n28\non the surface of each disk. Furthermore, the electric ﬁeld must be continuous across the\nsurface of the ellipsoid. Thus,\n∂ηVin(η) = ∂ηV (ρ,η)|ρ=ρ(η) (3.20)\nwhere ρ(η) satisﬁes (3.13). Using (2.10) and reminding that the ellipsis is located at r = 0\nin the r−ϑ plane, we have\n∂ηVin = log x(0,ϑ) = 1\n2 log cos2 ϑ+ logµ(0) (3.21)\n= 1\n2 log (−η) −1\n2 log\n(L2\n4q4\n2\n)\n+ logµ(0) (3.22)\nwhere η ∈(−L2\n4q4,0). We now use the Laplace equation to calculate the three dimensional\ncharge density d(η) inside the ellipsis\nd(η) = ∂2\nηVin + 1\nρ∂ρ(ρ∂ρVin) = ∂2\nηVin = 1\n2η (3.23)\nThe total charge density q(η) carried by the disk located at η is\nq(η) = 2π\n∫ R(η)\n0\nd(η) ρdρ = πd(η) R2 (η) = −π(2L4)2\n2q2\n4\n(\nL2\n4q4 + η\n)\n(3.24)\nThe total charge density q(η) allows us to compute the total charge Q and total dipole\nmoment P carried by the conﬁguration. When integrated over η\nQ=\n∫ 0\n−\nL2\n4q4\n2k\nq(η) dη= −π\n2 L6\n4 , (3.25)\nit reproduces the total number of M2-branes using the identity (2.125)\nQ\n4π = −L6\n4\n8 , (3.26)\nderived from our asymptotic analysis. When calculating the total dipole moment, using the\ncontinuous version of (2.120)\nP = 1\n4π\n∫ 0\n−\nL2\n4q4\n2k\nηq(η) dη= L8\n4q4\n12 , (3.27)\nwe again reproduce the asymptotic match (2.129).\nThe total number of M5-brane is obtained from the quantisation condition (2.16). This\nonly depends on the range of the η coordinate where there exists a non-trivial conducting\ndisk distribution. Thus,\nN5 = 4\nπℓ3\np\n∑\ni\n(ηi+1 −ηi) = 2L3\n4\nπℓ3\np\nq4\nL4\n. (3.28)\nThis is again consistent with the microscopic relation (3.2).\n29\n3.2 AdS 7×S4 superstar\nThe asymptotically AdS4×S7 half-BPS superstar is an eleven dimensional supergravity con-\nﬁguration with metric given in (2.138). The solution depends on two parameters : L7 the\nradius of AdS 7 and q7 which determines its mass and R-charge through (2.140). Its micro-\nscopic interpretation is in terms of a distribution of giant gravitons over the 4-sphere [14].\nThe latter is consistent with the ﬂux quantisation condition\nq7\nL4\n7\n= N2\nN2\n5\n. (3.29)\nwhere N2 stands for the number of giant gravitons (M2-branes).\nMatching LLM: To embed (2.138) into (2.11), we consider the coordinate transformation\nη= h(r) sin ϑ, ρ = w(r) cos ϑ. (3.30)\nDemanding no cross-term in drdϑ, we obtain\nw=\n√\nh2 + c, (3.31)\nfor some integration constant c. We now follow a similar procedure to the one described in\nthe previous subsection. We consider the ρ−η plane\ndρ2 + dη2 =\n(\nh2 cos2 ϑ+\n(\nh2 + c\n)\nsin2 ϑ\n)[\ndϑ2 + h′2\nh2 + cdr2\n]\n, (3.32)\ncompare with the superstar metric (2.138), we obtain the transformation\nη=L7\n8\n(L2\n7\n2 + r2\n)\nsin ϑ, (3.33)\nρ=L7\n8\n(\nr4 + r2L2\n7 + q7\n)1\n2 cos ϑ. (3.34)\nComparing the 5-sphere and 2-sphere sizes also ﬁxes\n˙V = L7\n23 r2 sin ϑ. (3.35)\nTo identify the conducting disk distribution supporting this conﬁguration, we examine\nthe locations where ˙V vanishes. Since ϑ∈[0, π\n2 ], this occurs either for ϑ= 0 or r= 0. The\nϑ= 0 region corresponds to η = 0 and ρ >L7 q\n1\n2\n7\n8 . There is no charge distribution since the\npotential is continuous here. The r= 0 region describes a hemiellipsoid\nη2\n(\nL3\n7\n16\n)2 + ρ2\n(\nL7q\n1\n2\n7\n8\n)2 = 1 , η > 0 (3.36)\n30\nwhile on the semi-inﬁnite line ρ= 0 η >L3\n7\n16 we have the line charge distribution\nλ= η−L3\n7\n16 (3.37)\nexactly as in the case of the vacuum.\nIn total it looks like we densely placed an inﬁnite sequence of circular conducting disks\ncentered at ρ= 0 and at 0 <ηi < L3\n7\n16 with radii Ri satisfying\nη2\ni(\nL3\n7\n16\n)2 + R2\ni\n(\nL7q\n1\n2\n7\n8\n)2 = 1, η > 0 (3.38)\nUsing a similar procedure to the one in the previous subsection we can identify the\ntransformation to the LLM coordinates\nx= L7\n8 µ(r) cos ϑ (3.39)\nfor some function µ(r). For the current case, we ﬁnd we should identify\neD = 2r3\nµµ′ (3.40)\nwith the function µ satisfying the diﬀerential equation\n2\nr\nµ′\nµ = 4r2\nL2\n7r2 + r4 + q7\n(3.41)\nFor similar reasons to the previous subsection the above identiﬁcation ﬁxes the electric\nﬁeld inside the hemiellipsoid to be\n∂ηVin = log x(0,ϑ) = log\n(L7µ(0)\n8\n)\n+ 1\n2 log\n(\n1 −162\nL6\n7\nη2\n)\n(3.42)\nfrom where we can compute the charge density\nd(η) = ∂2\nηVin + 1\nρ∂ρ(ρ∂ρVin) = ∂2\nηVin = −162\nL6\n7\nη\n1 −162\nL6\n7\nη2 (3.43)\nFinally, we compute\nP = 1\n4π\n∫ L3\n7\n16\n0\nπR2 (η) d(η) dη= − L5\n7\n3 ·212 q7 , (3.44)\nwhich matches our asymptotic analysis (2.145).\n31\n3.3 General superstar-like singular conﬁgurations\nGiven a continuous distribution of conducting disks determined by the value of the potential\nat the disks Vd(η) and its boundary shape R(η), it is natural to ask what singular conﬁgu-\nration it corresponds to. Using the Laplace equation ﬁxes the conductor charge density\nd(η) = ∂2\nηVd(η) . (3.45)\nContinuity of the electric ﬁeld at the boundary of the distribution requires\nnm∂mV(R(η), η)|boundary −nm∂mVd(η)|boundary = 0 , (3.46)\nwhere nm stands for a vector normal to such boundary. In general, this is a non-trivial\nintegral equation relating the shape of the conductor R(η) to its charge density d(η).\nThis boundary condition determines the potential uniquely. To see this, deﬁne\nΦ = V(ρ, η) −Vd(η) (3.47)\ninside the boundary ( R(η),η), where V(ρ, η) stands for the total potential. Because of the\nLaplace equation and (3.46), this function satisﬁes\n□Φ = 0 , n m∂mΦ|boundary = 0 . (3.48)\nThe solution to this boundary problem is unique\nΦ = 0 ⇒ V = Vd, (3.49)\nThus, the potential inside the conductor equals the potential of the disk distribution, as\nit should. This establishes the existence of a precise correspondence between the space of\nsingular conﬁgurations of the type we have discussed in this section and the shape of the\ncontinuous conductor boundary R(η).\nOn the other hand, we know the potential outside of the conductor. If the solution is\nasymptotically AdS4×S7, then it is given by\nV (ρ,η) = Vb(ρ,η) − 1\n4π\n∫ η2\nη1\ndη′\n∫ R(η′)\n0\ndρ′ρ′\n∫ 2π\n0\ndφ d(η′)√\nρ2 + ρ′2 −2ρρ′cos φ+ (η−η′)2\n,\nwhere 0 >η2 >η >η1 and Vb stands for (2.39). If it is asymptotic to AdS 7×S4, then\nV (ρ,η) =Vb(ρ,η) −Vb(ρ,−η) + Vdp(ρ,η) −Vdp(ρ,−η)\nVdp(ρ,η) = − 1\n4π\n∫ η2\nη1\ndη′\n∫ R(η′)\n0\ndρ′ρ′\n∫ 2π\n0\ndφ ∂2\nηVd(η′)√\nρ2 + ρ′2 −2ρρ′cos φ+ (η−η′)2\nwhere L3\n4/16 >η2 >η >η1 >0 and Vb stands for (2.64).\n32\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Nadav Drukker, Iosif Bena and Nick Warner for discussions.
