This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nAbstract In this paper, an ultrathin transparent metamate-\nrial polarization transformer using a circular twist-split-ring\nresonator (TSRR) was proposed and investigated experi-\nmentally and numerically. The experimental and simulated\nresults exhibit an asymmetric transmission only for forward\nand backward propagating linearly polarized waves. An in-\ncident linearly polarized wave can convert its polarization\nnearly completely to the cross direction after transmission\nunder certain conditions. The simulated spatial evolution of\nthe electric ﬁeld further indicates that the twist structure\nfunctions as a perfect polarization transformer at certain fre-\nquencies.\n1 Introduction\nElectromagnetic (EM) metamaterials (MMs) have attracted\nenormous interest in recent decades due to their unique re-\nsponses to EM radiation, which are generally not encoun-\ntered in their natural forms [ 1, 2]. MMs are usually peri-\nodically arranged with artiﬁcial materials that can be com-\nposed of dielectric elements or structured metallic compo-\nnents [ 2, 3]. Polarization is an important characteristic of\nEM waves and could be applicable in many areas, such as\nantennas, astronavigation, and communication [4–8]. Thus,\nit is highly desirable to efﬁciently control the polarization of\nEM waves [9]. Conventionally, optical gratings and dichroic\ncrystals can be used to convert polarization by employ-\ning, e.g., the Brewster and birefringence effects [ 10]. How-\nY. C h e n g· Y. N i e· X. Wang · R. Gong (/letter)\nSchool of Optical and Electronic Information,\nHuazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074,\nChina\ne-mail: rzhgong@mail.hust.edu.cn\never, the conversion efﬁciency is very low. Recently, chi-\nral metamaterials (CMMs) have attracted much attention,\ndue to their optical activity, circular or elliptical dichroism,\nand negative index [ 11–20]. CMMs are artiﬁcial materials\nthat lack any planes of mirror symmetry; they exhibit cross-\ncoupling between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at reso-\nnance [10, 15]. Thus, the similar design of chiral MMs could\nbe used to convert polarization of incident EM waves, re-\nsulting in, e.g., giant optical activity [ 15] and polarization\nrotation [17]. The asymmetric transmission (AT) of polar-\nized light is an important research aspect of planar CMMs\nand has become a hot topic in recent years [ 18–25]. The\nAT effect of circular or linear polarization has been studied\nfor different MM structures, where the partial conversion\nof the incident EM wave is asymmetric for opposite prop-\nagation directions, which mainly originates from the inter-\naction of EM radiation with the structural two-dimensional\n(2D) chirality in the MMs [23–27]. Thus, we can manipulate\nthe polarization of EM waves by employing the AT effect,\nsuch as converting its polarization completely to the cross\ndirection, and realizing circular or elliptical polarization af-\nter transmission under certain conditions [15, 23–27]. Men-\nzel et al. and Kang et al. introduced the design criterion of\nAT for polarized EM radiation theoretically with a 4×4m a -\ntrix analysis based on the classical model of optical activity\n[21, 23, 24].\nIn this paper, we demonstrate experimentally and numer-\nically an AT phenomenon for linearly polarized EM waves\nonly and a linear polarization transformation. Based on the\ndesign criterion of the AT effect of MMs, the designed MM\npolarization transformer is composed of 90◦ twist-split-ring\nresonators (TSRRs) on both sides of a dielectric slab. A po-\nlarization conversion ratio (PCR) of 95 % in the experiment\nand 97 % in simulation can be achieved. Calculations on the\nspatial evolution of ﬁeld distributions provide an intuitive\n210 Y. C h e n g e t a l .\npicture of the interlayer coupling for polarization transfor-\nmation inside the slab. Furthermore, when using a loss-free\ndielectric substrate as the middle spacer, the AT parameter\ncan achieve a value of nearly unity.\n2 Design, simulation, and experiment\nFirst, for the Cartesian coordinates x–y–z, considering an\nincident EM ﬁeld Ei propagating in the +z direction, we\ncan deﬁne expressions for the electric ﬁeld vector of the\nincident and transmitted wave along the x-polarized and\ny-polarized directions as follows:\nE\ni(r,t) =\n(\nEi\nx\nEi\ny\n)\nei(kz−ωt) (1a)\nEt(r,t) =\n(\nEt\nx\nEt\ny\n)\nei(kz−ωt) (1b)\nwhere ω, k, Ex, and Ey represent the angular frequency,\nwave vector, and complex amplitudes of the EM wave,\nrespectively. To better understand the cross-polarization\nconversion of the designed MM structure, the transmis-\nsion/reﬂection coefﬁcient tf( b)\nij = Et\ni /Ei\nj /rf( b)\nij = Er\ni /Ei\nj is\ndeﬁned in terms of the complex amplitude of the electric\nﬁeld, with the ﬁrst and the second subscripts i and j denot-\ning the polarized states of the transmitted/reﬂected wave and\nincident wave components, respectively. The superscriptsf\nand b denote forward propagation (along the +z direction)\nand backward propagation (along the −z direction) of the\nEM wave, and a special linear base with base vectors par-\nallel to the coordinate axes, i.e., decomposing the ﬁeld into\nx- and y-polarized waves, respectively. Thus, we can use\nthe Jones matrix (transmission matrix, also called T ma-\ntrix) formulations and the reciprocity theorem to obtain the\ntransmission propagation for a linear polarized wave in the\n+z and −z directions [14]:\n(\nt\nf\nx\ntf\ny\n)\n= T f\nli\n(\nEi\nx\nEi\ny\n)\n=\n(\ntxx txy\ntyx tyy\n)(\nEi\nx\nEi\ny\n)\n(2a)\n(\ntb\nx\ntb\ny\n)\n= tb\nli\n(\nEi\nx\nEi\ny\n)\n=\n(\ntxx −tyx\n−txy tyy\n)(\nEi\nx\nEi\ny\n)\n(2b)\nThe subscript li indicates the linear polarized wave. Thus,\nthe T matrices for propagation in the +z and −z directions\nfor a linear polarization basis, tf\nli and tb\nli , can be expressed\nas:\ntf\nli =\n(\ntxx txy\ntyx tyy\n)\n(3a)\ntb\nli =\n(\ntxx −tyx\n−txy tyy\n)\n(3b)\nwhere txx and tyy indicate the co-polarization transmission\ncoefﬁcient, and txy and tyx indicate the cross-polarization\ntransmission coefﬁcient. We use the parameter γ to repre-\nsent the PCR of the transmitted wave in different polariza-\ntion directions (x-polarization and y-polarization) for the in-\ncident waves; this parameter can be deﬁned as follows:\nγx =| tyx |2/\n(\n|tyx |2 +| txx |2 +| ryx |2 +| rxx |2)\n(4a)\nγy =| txy|2/\n(\n|txy|2 +| tyy|2 +| rxy|2 +| ryy|2)\n(4b)\nIf, without absorption and diffractions, the denominator\nof the above two equations is 1, then we can get the PCR\nparameters γx =| tyx |2 and γy =| txy|2, respectively. The\nconversion relation of the transmission coefﬁcients of lin-\nearly and circularly polarized waves for propagation in the\n+z direction can be given as:\nt =\n(\nt\n++ t+−\nt−+ t−−\n)\n= 1\n2\n(\n(txx + tyy) + i(txy − tyx )( t xx − tyy) − i(txy + tyx )\n(txx − tyy) + i(txy + tyx )( t xx + tyy) − i(txy − tyx )\n)\n(5)\nGenerally, the AT effect for both the linearly and circu-\nlarly polarized waves is characterized by the parameter /Delta1,\nwhich is deﬁned as the difference between the transmit-\ntances in the two opposite propagation directions ( +z and\n−z) and is used to represent the degree of the AT [ 23–25].\nThus, the AT parameter/Delta1for the linearly and circularly po-\nlarized waves can be expressed as:\n/Delta1x\nli =| tyx |2 −| txy|2 =− /Delta1y\nli (6a)\n/Delta1−\nli =| t+−|2 −| t−+|2 =− /Delta1+\nli (6b)\nAccording to the above classical formulations of optical\nactivity, we can ﬁnd the AT of transmitted waves for linear\npolarization only can be achieved [21]:\n/Delta1x\nli =− /Delta1y\nli ̸=0 (7a)\n/Delta1−\nli =− /Delta1+\nli = 0 (7b)\nObviously, the AT effect depends on the speciﬁc polariza-\ntion base. For both bases given here it is exclusively deter-\nmined by the difference between the off-diagonal elements\nof the respective T matrices. Additionally, note that for an\narbitrary base the diagonal elements of the T matrix for dif-\nferent propagation directions are not identical and will also\nAn ultrathin transparent metamaterial polarization transformer based on a twist-split-ring resonator 211\nFig. 1 (a) Unit cell of bilayer TSRR structure.

Thus, the transmission elements of\nco-polarization and cross-polarization should satisfy the fol-\nlowing conditions:\n|t\nyx |̸ =|txy| (8a)\n|txx |=| tyy| (8b)\nBased on the above analysis, to achieve polarization\ntransformation, we can design a similar CMM structure. The\nmetallic resonant structure in each layer has the same arbi-\ntrary pattern; however, when the ﬁrst layer structure is ﬁxed,\nthe structure in the second layer should be rotated clockwise\n90\n◦ along the propagation direction of the EM wave. Thus,\nany planes of mirror symmetry can be broken.\nHere, we employ a simple circular split-ring resonator\n(SRR) as the resonant structure. The unit cell of the designed\nMM consists of two metallic SRRs on both sides of a di-\nelectric substrate twisted 90\n◦ to each other, which is differ-\nent than the design of a negative refractive index MM [ 28].\nFigure 1(a) shows the schematic diagram of the unit cell;\nthe metallic pattern in the front and back layers is symmet-\nric along the x axis and y axis, respectively. This design\nwill satisfy the requirements of ( 8a), while also facilitating\nthe achievement of an efﬁcient coupling between the two\nchiral planar MMs and an enhanced EM response [ 29]. Fi-\nnally, the mirror symmetry of the whole structure is broken\nin the propagation z direction and in the x–y plane, due to\nthe two copper patterns separated by the middle dielectric\nspacer. The geometry dimension parameters are, in millime-\nters: p = 10, r = 3.3, g = 0.2, w = 1.2, t\ns = 1.2. The metal-\nlic layers on both sides were modeled as a 0.036 mm copper\nﬁlm with an electric conductivity σ = 5.8 × 10\n7 S/m. An\nFR-4 (lossy) substrate with a permittivity of 3.6 and a loss\ntangent of 0.025 was selected as the dielectric spacer. The\nsimulation has been performed based on the standard ﬁnite\ndifference time domain (FDTD) method by using CST Mi-\ncrowave Studio’s Frequency Domain Solver. The periodic\nboundary conditions are applied to the x and y directions\nand the absorbing boundary conditions to the z direction as\nwell.\nFor the experiments, the designed structures were fabri-\ncated into a 20 × 20 unit cell sample (200 mm × 200 mm\n× 1.272 mm) using the conventional printed circuit board\n(PCB) process with 36 µm thick copper patterns on both\nsides of a FR-4 (lossy) substrate.

The complex transmission/reﬂection\ncoefﬁcients of the experimental measurements were carried\nout in an EM anechoic chamber [ 27]. An Agilent PNA-X\nN5244A vector network analyzer connected to two standard\ngain broadband linearly polarized horn antennas that pro-\nduced microwaves in the range of 7–12 GHz was used to\nmeasure the MM sample. All components of the EM wave\ntransmission/reﬂection (the complex Jones matrix) for dif-\nferent polarizations were measured by changing the orienta-\ntion of the two horn antennas.\n3 Results and discussion\nBased on the preceding simulations and experiments, we\ncan get the transmission/reﬂection coefﬁcients (the com-\nplex Jones matrix) as shown in Fig. 2. This ﬁgure shows\nthe simulated and measured spectra for the four transmis-\nsion/reﬂection matrix elements of the designed slab for\npropagation in the backward (−z) direction. The experimen-\ntal results are in excellent agreement with the simulations\nacross the whole frequency range. From Figs. 2(a) and (b),\nwhen the propagation is along the −z direction of the inci-\ndent linear polarization wave, the co-polarization transmis-\nsion t\nxx and tyy always remain the same (e.g., txx = tyy),\nwhile the cross-polarization components txy and tyx differ\nsigniﬁcantly across the whole frequency range both in the\nexperiment and the simulation. These results are in agree-\nment with our analysis in ( 8a) and ( 8b), clearly leading to\na strong AT effect for linear polarization. The amplitudes\nfor the co-polarization transmission reduce to a minimum of\nabout 0.1 at 9.9 GHz. One can clearly observe that the am-\nplitude of the cross-polarization transmission t\nxy achieves a\nmaximum of 0.74 in the experiment and 0.77 in the simu-\nlation around the resonance frequency of 9.65 GHz, while\nt\nyx is very small and stays below 0.1 in the entire frequency\nrange.\nThe remarkable difference between the two cross-polar-\nization transmissions may contribute to the polarization con-\nversion of the designed structure. Thus, when they-polarized\n(x-polarized) wave is normally incident to the structure\nalong the −z (+z) direction, the wave is well coupled to\nthe structure and is converted mostly to the x-polarized\n(y-polarized) wave due to the cross-coupling between the\ntwo metallic layers when passing through the designed MM.\n212 Y. C h e n g e t a l .\nFig. 2 (a), (c) Measured and\n(b), (d) calculated transmission\nand reﬂection spectra of the four\nmatrix components for\nbackward propagation\nHowever, along the opposite direction, the y-polarized (x-\npolarized) wave can hardly be coupled to the structure, re-\nsulting in a weak transmission [ 18, 25]. In other words, the\nincident y-polarized (x-polarized) wave is well converted to\na transmitted x-polarized (y-polarized) wave when passing\nthrough the designed MM, while the incident x-polarized\n(y-polarized) wave will be mostly forbidden to transmit for\npropagation along the −z (+z) direction. Thus, the designed\nMM can be used as a transparent polarization transformer\nfor linearly polarized EM radiation. Figures 2(c) and (d)\nshow the experimental and simulated reﬂection (the com-\nplex Jones matrix) for propagation along the −z direction;\nthe cross-polarization reﬂections r\nxy and ryx are very small\nand below 0.15 in the entire frequency range. While the co-\npolarization reﬂection r\nyy reduces to a minimum of about\n0.1 at a frequency of 9.5 GHz, rxx is near unity both in the\nexperiment and the simulation across the whole frequency\nrange. These results of the reﬂection further verify that the\nincident x-polarized (y-polarized) wave will be forbidden to\ntransmit for propagation along the −z (+z) direction. That\nis, the coupling of the split rings among each other is very\nlow for this polarization, and nearly without magnetic cou-\npling, resulting in a high reﬂectivity, and no polarization\ntransformation can be observed.\nAccording to (6a) and (6b), we calculated the AT param-\neter /Delta1for both linear and circular polarization bases; the\nresults are illustrated in Fig. 3. One can observe that the am-\nplitude of the parameter /Delta1for linear polarization achieves a\nmaximum of 0.55 in the experiments and 0.59 in the simu-\nlations around 9.65 GHz. The parameter /Delta1for circular po-\nlarizations is near zero across the whole frequency range,\nwhich indicates that there is no AT for either the left or the\nright circularly polarized waves due to the speciﬁc asymme-\ntry in the designed structure. These results are in agreement\nwith our theoretical prediction in (7a) and (7b), and also fur-\nther verify the AT effect of our proposed structure.\nGenerally, the parameter γ can be used to measure the\npolarization conversion ratio of the designed MM for lin-\nearly polarized EM radiation. The PCR parameter γ of the\nproposed structure, calculated using ( 4a) and ( 4b)f o rt h e\nlinear polarization base for backward propagation, is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 4. From this ﬁgure, one can see clearly that the\nparameter γ for the incident y-polarized wave was achieved\nto a maximum of 95 % in the experiment and 97 % in the\nsimulation around the resonant frequency of 9.65 GHz for\nbackward propagation. However, the parameter γ for the\nincident x-polarized wave is near zero for both the exper-\niment and the simulation across the whole frequency range\nAn ultrathin transparent metamaterial polarization transformer based on a twist-split-ring resonator 213\nFig. 3 (a) Measured and\n(b) calculated AT parameter /Delta1\nfor linear and circular\npolarization bases\nFig. 4 (a) Measured and\n(b) calculated PCR parameter γ\nfor different linear polarization\nbases for backward propagation\nfor backward propagation. These results indicate that an in-\ncident linearly polarized wave passing through the designed\nMM can nearly perfectly convert its polarization to the cross\ndirection after transmission under certain conditions.\nTo better understand the physical insight of the polar-\nization transformation that is associated with the designed\nMM, we have calculated snapshots of the EM wave evolu-\ntion when propagating through the structure around the reso-\nnant frequency. Figure5 illustrates six snapshots of the elec-\ntric ﬁeld distribution for a y-polarized and x-polarized wave\npassing through the designed slab backward. These snap-\nshots correspond to the electric ﬁeld distributions for the\nEM wave in the incoming and outgoing regime as well as\ninside the designed MM. It can be seen clearly that the out-\ngoing waves are always x-polarized (see Figs. 5(c) and (f)),\neven when the incident wave is y-polarized (see Fig. 5(a))\nfor backward transmission at 9.6 GHz. We can obtain a\nreasonable explanation from the theoretical study of SRR\nstructure in Ref. [ 30], which demonstrated the interesting\nbianisotropic responses to EM waves. When they-polarized\nwave is incident along the backward direction, the fun-\ndamental electric resonance mode (similar to the electric\ndipole resonance mode) of the ﬁrst circular SRR can be ex-\ncited efﬁciently at the resonance with a strong EM wave\nbeing coupled into the designed MM. Then the near-ﬁeld\ncoupling between the ﬁrst and the second SRRs (similar\nto the magnetic dipole mode) results in an obvious trans-\nmitted wave, but the polarization has been converted to an\nx-polarized form. However, when the incident x-polarized\nwave passes through the designed MM for backward prop-\nagation, the ﬁeld strength inside the structure remains high\n(see Fig. 5(e)), and the incident wave is blocked at the en-\ntrance. Thus, the EM wave coupled into the MM is very\nweak, and results in a very small transmission without po-\nlarization transformation (see Figs. 5(d) and (f)). These fea-\ntures of near-ﬁeld coupling between the metallic layers of\nour proposed MM structure could further validate its func-\ntion as a perfect ultrathin (the thickness of the MM is smaller\nthan λ/26, where λ is the operating wavelength) transparent\npolarization transformer.\nGoing a step further, from the above analysis of experi-\nmental and simulated results of the MM polarization trans-\nformer for linearly polarized EM radiation, we ﬁnd that\nthe maximal value of the cross-polarization transmission\nt\nxy is relatively small (the experimental and simulated val-\nues are 0.74 and 0.77, respectively) at resonance for back-\nward propagation, which is mainly due to the dielectric loss\nof the FR-4 substrate.

One can observe\nthat the maximal value of cross-polarization transmission\nt\nxy and the AT parameter achieve values of 0.99 and 0.98\nat a resonant frequency of 9.1 GHz, respectively, which ver-\niﬁes our previous predictions. Therefore, we can obtain a\nhigh performance transparent MM polarization transformer\nby using a loss-free dielectric substrate.\n4 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we ﬁrst analyzed the design criterion for the\nAT effect of MMs, and then demonstrated experimentally\nand numerically an AT phenomenon for linearly polarized\nEM waves only and an ultrathin linear polarization trans-\nformer based on a TSRR-structured MM with a thickness\nsmaller than λ/26. An incident linearly polarized wave can\nconvert its polarization nearly completely to the cross direc-\ntion after transmission under certain conditions. The PCR\nwas achieved to a maximum of 95 % in the experiment and\n97 % in the simulation around a resonance frequency of\n9.65 GHz. The calculated snapshots of the EM wave evolu-\ntion of wave ﬁelds propagating inside the structure illustrate\nthe physical mechanism of the AT effect and polarization\ntransformation of our design. Further simulated results indi-\ncate that we can obtain a high performance MM polarization\ntransformer by using a loss-free or low-loss dielectric sub-\nstrate. Such a design may ﬁnd potential application in op-\ntical isolators, microwave wave plates, or other EM control\ndevices.\nAn ultrathin transparent metamaterial polarization transformer based on a twist-split-ring resonator 215\nAcknowledgements This work is supported by the National Natural\nScience Foundation of China (51207060).\nOpen Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Cre-\native Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribu-\ntion, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s)\nand the source are credited.\nReferences\n1.
