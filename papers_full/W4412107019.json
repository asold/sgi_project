    "abstract": "Software logs generated by sophisticated network emulators in the telecommunications industry, such as VIAVI TM500, are extremely complex, often comprising tens of thousands of text lines with minimal resemblance to natural language. Only specialised expert engineers can decipher such logs and troubleshoot defects in test runs. While AI offers a promising solution for automating defect triage, potentially leading to massive revenue savings for companies, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) suffer from significant drawbacks in this specialised domain. These include a constrained context window, limited applicability to text beyond natural language, and high inference costs. To address these limitations, we propose a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that offers a context window spanning up to 200,000 characters and achieves over 96% accuracy (F<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$1\\gt 0.9$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) in classifying multifaceted software logs into various layers in the telecommunications protocol stack. Specifically, the proposed model is capable of identifying defects in test runs and triaging them to the relevant department, formerly a manual engineering process that required expert knowledge. We evaluate several LLMs; LLaMA2-7B, Mixtral_<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$8\\times 7$ </tex-math></inline-formula>B, Flan-T5, BERT and BigBird, and experimentally demonstrate their shortcomings in our specialized application. Despite being lightweight, our CNN achieves strong performance compared to LLM-based approaches in telecommunications log classification while minimizing the cost of production. Our defect triaging AI model is deployable on edge devices without dedicated hardware and is applicable across software logs in various industries.",
