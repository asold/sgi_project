With the advent \nand increasing pervasiveness of generative AI (Banh and Strobel 2023; \nCox et al. 2019), the scope of an academic library has expanded to include \nthe deployment of AI-based, data-driven information services such as re-\nsearch data management (Andrikopoulou et al. 2022), ontology-driven \ncontent management (Bagchi 2021a, 2021b), and chatbots (Bagchi 2020), \nall of which depend on a well-founded metadata model semantically an-\nnotating and exposing underlying data. For instance, let us consider the \nscenario of semantically annotating scientific information in cancer re-\nsearch (e.g., cancer big data [Jiang et al. 2022]) within the framework of \nan academic library. Such an exercise is clearly dependent on a multitude \nof factors, such as the purpose of the information, the target user base, \ntechnical features, and so on, each of which helps define the informa-\ntion service that will harness the information. Thus, a metadata model \ndesigned for a specialized cancer research library would be significantly, if \nnot completely, different from one designed for an oncology policy library \n(Han and Hswe 2011). These models might, again, be considerably differ-\nent from a metadata model employed by a medical college library.\nThis paper argues that, as evidenced from the motivating scenario and \nseveral other similar use cases (e.g., Gartner 2016; Ulrich et al. 2022; van \nDijck 2014), there is no unique metadata model that is necessary and suf-\nficient for semantic data annotation within a single domain and certainly \nnot for the heterogeneity inherent in cross-domain use case scenarios (see \nalso EU-NSF Working Group on Metadata, n.d.). Through the lens of the \nmotivating scenario, the paper elucidates the interlinked representation levels \nthat cumulatively constitute a metadata model as indicated in the above \nthesis. First, the perception of the (expert) users of a cancer research library \ntoward cancer research data would be highly specialized (e.g., uncover -\ning multi-omics workflows [Ulrich et al. 2022]) and hence considerably \ndifferent to how the same data is perceived by the (expert) users of an \noncology policy library or a medical college library. Second, as a partial \nconsequence of the first reason, the terminology employed by the users of \nthe three types of libraries would also be different. Third, the decision to \nontologically characterize a perceived data concept as, for example, a func-\ntion or a process (Arp and Smith 2008), or an object property or a data \n metadata modeling / bagchi 299\nproperty (Bagchi 2022a), would be different for each user group. Fourth, \nas a direct consequence of the ontological characterization, the taxonomy \nassumed by the users of the three types of libraries would be markedly \ndifferent (Bagchi and Madalli 2019). Fifth, the characterization of the tax-\nonomy in terms of interrelating and describing its constituent concepts via \nobject properties and data properties would differ. Finally, it is also key to \nnote that in the ordered representation levels, each level independently as \nwell as cumulatively compounds the design of a metadata model created \nby one library and complicates its crosswalk with metadata models created \nby other libraries.\nThe contextualization of this motivating scenario into a general the-\nsis about modeling metadata is not by chance. It is a direct instantiation \nof the problem of Conceptual Entanglement (Bagchi and Das 2022, 2023), \nubiquitous in knowledge organization and representation research, which \nposits that any conceptual knowledge model (e.g., a metadata model) is \nrepresentationally manifold by design and cannot be necessary and sufficient \nfor all use cases irrespective of its intradomain or interdomain setting.\nFirst, there is always a many-to-many correspondence (hereafter re-\nferred to as representational manifoldness) between entities and how they \nare perceived as concepts (e.g., by sets of users of the three different librar-\nies). Second, given perception, there is always a representational mani-\nfoldness between the perceived concepts and how they are linguistically \nlabeled (e.g., by the same sets of users) using some terminology. Third, \ngiven labeling, there is always a representational manifoldness between \nthe labeled concepts and their ontological status (e.g., by the same sets \nof users). Fourth, as a consequence of the manifoldness in ontological \ncharacterization, there is always a representational manifoldness between \nthe ontologically characterized concepts and how they ought to be taxo-\nnomically classified (e.g., as per the warrant of the same set of users). Fifth, \nthere is always a representational manifoldness between the taxonomi-\ncally classified concepts and how they are interrelated and described via \nproperties.\nThis leads to two observations. First, it is interesting to note how the \nindividual and cumulative impact of the representation layers magnifies \nthe entanglement in the final metadata model. Second, and perhaps most \nimportantly, there is a need to explicate the decision of the modeler (e.g., a \nmetadata librarian) at each level, which, in an overwhelming majority of \ncases, remains implicit (Bagchi and Das 2022, 2023).\nThe solution proposed in this paper is a generative AI–driven, large \nlanguage model (LLM)–based enhancement of an early version of the \napproach termed Conceptual Disentanglement (Bagchi and Das 2022, 2023). \nThe key focus of this approach is to explicitly disentangle the decisions made \nby the modeler (e.g., a metadata librarian), at each knowledge represen-\ntation level, which would otherwise implicitly entangle the final conceptual \n300 library trends/february 2025\nknowledge artifact (e.g., the metadata model). To that end, the general \nstrategy of the approach is to explicitly enforce one-to-one correspondence \n(hereafter referred to as representational bijection) out of the potentially \nmany representational manifold possibilities at each level. To explain us-\ning the motivating scenario, first, the metadata librarian (who is the mod-\neler) should explicate a representational bijection between entities and \ntheir consensual perception as concepts (e.g., by a particular set of users of \na library). Second, given the fixation of perception, the metadata librarian \nshould explicate a representational bijection between the perceived con-\ncepts and their linguistic labeling via a consensual body of terminology. \nThird, given the fixation of terminology, the metadata librarian should ex-\nplicate a representational bijection between the labeled concepts and their \nontological commitments (Guarino et al. 1994)—in other words, whether \nthey are events, processes, or properties. In fact, an ontology-driven meta-\ndata model is key to encode precise semantics represented within (meta)\ndata concepts and properties (see, e.g., the arguments advanced in Dutta \n2014; Leipzig et al. 2021). Fourth, the metadata librarian should expli-\ncate a representational bijection between the ontologically characterized \nconcepts and their exact taxonomy. Fifth, given the taxonomy, the meta-\ndata librarian should explicate a representational bijection between each \nconcept in the taxonomy and their exact definition via properties. Finally, \nit is interesting to note how the individual as well as the cumulative disen-\ntanglement of the representation layers minimizes the entanglement in \nthe final metadata model. The decision of the modeler should be explicit \nat each representation level, thereby crucially impacting the minimization \nof the conceptual entanglement.\nWhile the contextualization, problem, and solution approaches are \nclear to some extent, it is not yet clear as to how the solution approach \ncan be potentially implemented by a metadata librarian. In fact, two criti-\ncal complementary highlights should characterize any implementation \nstrategy of the conceptual disentanglement approach for modeling library \nmetadata. First, while the approach attempts to disentangle, level by level, \nthe entanglement inherent by design in a metadata model, it runs the \nrisk of considerable intellectual work on the part of the metadata librar -\nian in terms of manually factoring and refactoring the constituent knowl-\nedge management nitty-gritty (Bagchi 2019, 2022b). On the other hand, \ngiven the justified complexity of the conceptual disentanglement ap-\nproach (e.g., in layers such as perception or ontology), an overtly (semi)\nautomatic implementation is not poised to produce an ontology-driven \nmetadata model of requisite quality. To harness the best of both worlds \n(i.e., human and machine), the paper proposes a novel implementation \nof the conceptual disentanglement approach via generative AI–driven, \nhuman-LLM collaboration, where the metadata librarian, using prompt \n metadata modeling / bagchi 301\nengineering (Ekin 2023), exploits an LLM (Chang et al. 2024; Liang et al. \n2022) to generate a conceptually (dis)entangled metadata model that, for \neach representational level, is validated/repaired/enriched by the librar -\nian. The validation, repair, or enrichment of the human-LLM collabora-\ntively generated metadata model can involve several standard dimensions. \nFor metadata librarians, these dimensions could include metadata qual-\nity (Park 2009), semantic quality (Poels et al. 2005), and purpose-specific \ndimensions such as metadata model fitness for cancer data/information. \nOverall, a widespread acceptance and implementation of the conceptual \ndisentanglement approach via generative AI–driven human-LLM col-\nlaboration is poised to bring to the fore several advantages in terms of \nmetadata development methodologies, metadata crosswalk and interop-\nerability (Khoo and Hall 2010), semantic heterogeneity (Hull 1997), and \nFAIR data (Wilkinson et al. 2016).\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The second section \ndescribes the different knowledge representation levels involved in designing a \nmetadata model and how such levels are ordered and interlinked to cumu-\nlatively impact its design. The third section details the problem of concep-\ntual entanglement individually and cumulatively across the representation \nlevels and their confounding impact on the design of the metadata model. \nThe fourth section elucidates the generative AI–driven human-LLM \ncollaboration-based conceptual disentanglement approach and the way \nit minimizes the entanglement and confusion in the design of the meta-\ndata model. Finally, the fifth section discusses research implications from \nthe related work in terms of some of the generative AI, metadata, and \nsemantics-based research issues academic libraries face. Throughout the \npaper, an adapted instantiation of the motivating scenario of a simplified \nontology-driven metadata model for cancer information will be employed \nto exemplify and highlight the issues and approaches. Given the method-\nological scope of the paper, several technical intricacies, for example, of \nknowledge representation, are not addressed.\nAs part of the research for this paper, three variations of an ontology- \ndriven library metadata model for the cancer domain (e.g., encoding con-\ncepts such as clinical trial, patient, biomarker, imaging test, histopathology \nreport) were generated by ChatGPT 3.5 through a series of prompts (avail-\nable for readers to review at Bagchi 2024). While these metadata models \nare informal in nature, this is not relevant to the scope of this paper, as \nsimilar models could be formalized in any language of choice (e.g., the \nweb ontology language) for concrete implementation purposes.\nRepresentation Levels in Modeling Metadata\nThis section of the paper expands the discussion on the characteristi-\ncally independent but functionally interlinked knowledge organization and \n[91.100.61.210]   Project MUSE (2025-11-05 17:26 GMT)\n302 library trends/february 2025\nrepresentation levels that cumulatively compose any metadata model \nwithin the framework of an academic library. To that end, we have the \nfollowing levels:\n1. Perceptual level, wherein the correspondence between entities and their \nperception as concepts is modeled;\n2. Terminological level, wherein the correspondence between perceived \nconcepts and the terms that linguistically represent them is modeled;\n3. Ontological level, wherein the correspondence between labeled concepts \nand their ontological commitment is modeled;\n4. Taxonomical level, wherein the correspondence between ontologically \nenriched concepts and their classification into a taxonomic hierarchy \nis modeled;\n5. Definitional level, wherein the correspondence between the taxonomic \nconcepts and how they are interrelated and described via properties is \nmodeled.\nThe perceptual level, while not explicitly pronounced in state-of-the-art \nlibrary metadata research and implementation (see, e.g., Haynes 2018; \nStrecker et al. 2021), is the very first level to achieve the crucial repre-\nsentational choice as to how a set of entities should be perceived as con-\ncepts (later) composing a library metadata model. Two key dimensions \nshould inform the decision-making of a metadata librarian at this level. \nFirst, perception is highly egocentric to an individual academic library user \nand therefore is usually incomplete (Das et al. 2023) and cannot be fully \ncaptured in a (semi)formal manner. Second, it is also the case that various \ncommunities of practice (Cox 2005; Wenger 1999), such as users of different \ntypes of libraries, commit to a shared perception for how certain entities \nshould be perceived as concepts.\nConsider the case of the motivating example and the metadata models \ngenerated using ChatGPT. First, the author was able to use ChatGPT 3.5 \nto generate a general (ontology-driven) library metadata model for the \ncancer domain with constituent concepts (classes and properties) at three \nlevels of abstraction (Bagchi 2024, 1–7). Next, the general model, via suc-\ncessive prompts, was tuned to the potential perceptions of a representa-\ntive library user belonging to the specialized cancer research community \n(Bagchi 2024, 8–10), oncology policy community (Bagchi 2024, 10–12), \nand medical college student community (Bagchi 2024, 12–14). It is inter-\nesting to observe that even for the same macro domain (i.e., cancer), each \nof the three metadata models encodes concepts and properties uniquely \nrelevant to the perception of a specific user community.\nSecond, given the understanding as to why perception is crucial for \nmodeling metadata, let us now turn to the terminological level, where the \nkey representational choice is to decide how a set of perceived concepts \nshould be labeled using a body of terminology. This choice is not trivial \n metadata modeling / bagchi 303\nfor the metadata librarian due to the very nature of the interaction of \nlanguage with the perceptual level. Languages are “itemized [terminologi-\ncal] inventories” (Brown and Lenneberg 1954) of the entities we perceive, \nand each of such inventories generates either similar (but not the same) \nor different lexicalizations of the perception due to linguistic relativity \n(Boroditsky 2011). Such a lexicalization might manifest among different \nsets of academic library users in terms of different linguistic phenomena. \nFor example, two well-known linguistic phenomena include polysemy, \nthe coexistence of several potential meanings of a term, and synonymy, \nterms having similar meanings (Glynn and Robinson 2014). Lexical gaps \n(Bentivogli and Pianta 2000) occur when a specific language/vocabulary \ndoes not have a referent term for a concept. The scenario might get even \nmore confounded when library user communities communicate with each \nother or with the computer system by linguistically referring to the per -\nceived entities with terms from specialized terminological standards (Su-\nonuuti 1997) or glossaries (Sarginson et al. 2012), possibly from different \nlanguages. There might be issues with both mapping and interoperability \nof terms among the standards due to issues of linguistic phenomena or \nnonexistent terminological crosswalks. In the motivating example, the au-\nthor prompted ChatGPT 3.5 to clarify the terminology employed in the \nthree examples (Bagchi 2024, 20–23). Notice that parts of the cancer re-\nsearch library metadata model use terms from the Dublin Core (Weibel et \nal. 1998) to express its perceived concepts. Similarly, the oncology policy \nlibrary and the medical college library metadata models use terms from \nstandards such as Health Level 7, the National Comprehensive Cancer \nNetwork, and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine–Clinical Terms \n(Schulz et al. 2019).\nThird, given the central importance of terminology in the design of any \nlibrary metadata model, the next dimension to understand is the ontologi-\ncal level, where the key representational choice regarding the ontologi-\ncal commitment (Guarino et al. 1994) of the (newly) labeled concepts is \nmade. This choice, again, is significant for the metadata librarian due to \nthe theoretical root of the interaction of ontology with the terminological \nlevel, in the sense that committing to a terminology results in committing \nto an ontology (Moltmann 2019) that might not be necessarily completely \ncompatible with another ontology/terminology pairing. The chief im-\nportance of this representation level is to explicate the otherwise implicit \ncommitment of the body of terms to a top-level ontology (Guarino 1997), \nwherein such an ontology, based on an explicitly specified philosophical \ndoctrine, reveals the underlying nature of domain-level concepts. There \ncan be several such philosophical doctrines, such as three-dimensionalism, \nfour-dimensionalism, and so on (McCall and Lowe 2006), and according \nto the chosen doctrine, the domain-level labeled “concepts” can be classi-\nfied as a kind, a part-of, an event, a process, a role, a function, or a property \n304 library trends/february 2025\n(Gangemi et al. 2001). This representation layer is the most demanding \nin terms of the involvement of the human modeler, such as a metadata \nlibrarian, for the simple reason that while different library user communi-\nties might conceptualize the same set of entities into different top-level \nontological categories, it is chiefly the responsibility of the metadata li-\nbrarian to explicate such assumptions. Second, as evidenced in decades \nof research in semantic heterogeneity (Hull 1997), the ontological level \nis key to achieving a range of semantics-intensive tasks such as semantic \nmapping (Beneventano et al. 2008) and semantic interoperability (Bittner \net al. 2006) with respect to (meta)data models. In the motivating example, \nthe author used ChatGPT 3.5 to elicit the LLM response to the prompt re-\nquesting the ontological categories employed in the three examples (Bag-\nchi 2024, 23–29). For example, the LLM response aligns concepts and \nproperties such as “document” and has “author” to top-level ontological \ncategories such as “information object” and “quality” (Bagchi 2024, 26).\nFourth, given the importance of the ontological commitment of con-\nstituent concepts and properties in a library metadata model, let us con-\ncentrate on the taxonomical level, where the key representational choice \nregarding the ontologically characterized concepts and their classification \ninto a taxonomical hierarchy is made (see figure 1 for a quick glimpse). \nThis choice by the metadata librarian is guided by two key factors. First, \nthe ontological level already induces a very abstract, high-level taxonomy \nfor the concepts due to the mandatory ontological constraints (Guarino \net al. 1994) they pose, while the metadata librarian commits to a specific \ntop-level ontology and its constituent top-level ontological categories. For \nexample, if the concepts “person” and “patient” belong to the top-level \nontological categories “kind” and “role,” it is an ontological constraint \nthat “role” can never be the taxonomical parent of a “kind,” and, there-\nfore, “patient” can never be the taxonomical parent of “person.” Within \nthe ontological constraints, however, the taxonomy can be designed by \nthe metadata librarian in accordance with how its hierarchy and meta-\ndata properties will be exploited by the target information service (e.g., a \ndata catalog [Guptill 1999] or a chatbot [Bagchi 2020]). In the motivat-\ning example, the author used ChatGPT 3.5 to elicit the LLM response \nto the prompt requesting the taxonomical choices made for concepts as \nwell as properties (Bagchi 2024, 23–29). For example, on page 30, “li-\nbrary resource” is specialized into “research paper” and “dataset.” Notice \nthat, alongside the ontological level, the taxonomical level is also equally \ndemanding, if not more, in terms of the involvement of the metadata librar-\nian in modeling the classification hierarchy.\nLast but not the least, given the key importance of the taxonomic clas-\nsification in the composition of a library metadata model, let us focus \non the definitional level, where the key representational choice is how to \ninterrelate and describe each individual concept in the taxonomy (see \n metadata modeling / bagchi 305\nfigures 2 and 3 for a quick glimpse). This is done by first finalizing the \nspecialization of the already classified properties at the ontological level \ninto object properties and data properties (Bagchi and Madalli 2019). \nNote that even if the properties are informally classified as object or data \nproperty by the metadata librarian before this level, the final decision is \ntaken at this level. Second, each concept in the taxonomy is assigned with \na set of object properties that encode how the concept is interlinked with \nother concepts in the overall metadata model. Equally, and perhaps most \nimportantly, every taxonomic concept is assigned a set of data properties \nthat describe its attributes. This level is perhaps the most visible and pro-\nnounced level in a library metadata model when it comes to implementa-\ntion, as it decides on the data properties that ultimately encode real-world \nlibrary metadata. Also, this level is central to a library metadata model in \nthe sense that it decides the inheritance of data properties by classes (also \nknown as concepts) in the taxonomy, thereby considerably influencing \nthe decision concerning the description of each taxonomic concept by a \nset of data properties and data types. In the motivating example, the au-\nthor used ChatGPT 3.5 to elicit the LLM response to the prompt request-\ning the object and data property choices made (Bagchi 2024, 34–39). For \nexample, the concept “policy document” is described with data properties \nsuch as {policyDocumentID, policyDocumentTitle, policyDocumentText} \n(Bagchi 2024, 35).\nFigure 1. Taxonomical hierarchies for (a) a cancer research library, (b) an oncology \npolicy library, and (c) a medical college library.\n[91.100.61.210]   Project MUSE (2025-11-05 17:26 GMT)\n306 library trends/february 2025\nFigure 2.

Data property hierarchies for (a) a cancer research library, (b) an oncology policy library, and (c) a medical college library.\n metadata modeling / bagchi 307\nFinally, it is interesting to note two crucial points about the aforemen-\ntioned levels of knowledge organization and representation that consti-\ntute any library or even a generic metadata model. First, the ordering \nfrom perception to definition via properties is not just a linear, ordered \nsequence but is essentially an ordered and continual interlinked scientific \nspiral (Ranganathan 1957). To that end, successive cycles can be utilized \nby the metadata librarian to continuously validate, repair, update, and en-\nrich the library metadata model with changes in any of the representation \nlevels. This also reinforces the notion of the nonvalidity of a single or a \nfew metadata models as necessary and sufficient for any and every domain \nand application scenario. Second, notice that the above levels of repre-\nsentation are a general framework to understand the composition of a \nlibrary metadata model. It might well be the case that for a specific applica-\ntion scenario, the perceptual level or the terminological level or both are \nquite homogeneous and, therefore, of much less relative importance to \nthe model than the ontological level or the definitional level. In any case, \nsuch permutations and combinations of the relative importance of each \nrepresentation level to the final library metadata model should be decided \non a case-by-case basis.\nEntanglement in Modeling Metadata\nGiven the central and irreplaceable impact of the five functionally inter -\nlinked representation levels on the modeling of metadata, let us now focus \non how the conceptual entanglement problem is implicitly instantiated at \neach successive level within the metadata design strategy of an academic \nlibrary. To that end, the entanglement levels mirror the representation \nlevels:\n1. Perceptual entanglement, referring to the representational manifoldness \nbetween entities and their perception as concepts;\n2. Terminological entanglement, referring to the representational mani-\nfoldness between perceived concepts and the terms that are employed \nto label them;\n3. Ontological entanglement, referring to the representational manifold-\nness between labeled concepts and their ontological commitment;\n4. Taxonomical entanglement, referring to the representational manifold-\nness between ontologically enriched concepts and their taxonomic clas-\nsification;\n5. Definitional entanglement, referring to the representational manifold-\nness between the taxonomic concepts and their definition via properties.\nIn order to exemplify the stratification above, the same motivating ex-\nample of the ontology-driven library metadata model for the cancer do-\nmain is employed (Bagchi 2024, 8–43). Notice that the stratification of \nconceptual entanglement proposed above is in sync with the stratification \n308 library trends/february 2025\nof representation in metadata proposed in the second section. The above \nlevels are elucidated as follows.\nPerceptual entanglement refers to the many-to-many mapping between \nentities and their perception as concepts that would eventually compose \na library metadata model. Two key factors underlie the entanglement in \nthe decision-making of a metadata librarian at this level. First, as already \nbriefed before, perception is egocentric and can be unique to communi-\nties of practice. This premise leads to the notion of perception as a cog-\nnitive filter (Guarino et al. 2020), in other words, in our terms, the fact \nthat the same entity and its properties can be perceived differently by dif-\nferent groups of library users depending on their overall purpose and \ngoals. There can be an overlap in the concepts perceived between, say, \ntwo groups of library users, and, equally, there can be ranges of mutual \nexclusion in their perception (e.g., due to different purposes or goals). \nSecond, the highly implicit nature and consideration of perception within \nacademic library metadata design (see, e.g., Fleming et al. 2008; Lopatin \n2010) almost leads to the necessary and sufficient assumption (explained \nbefore) on the surface while the underlying multiplicities of perception \nremain unaddressed. Consider the case of the motivating example gener-\nated by ChatGPT 3.5 via human-LLM collaboration. Three different user \nperceptions, namely, of a representative cancer research library (Bagchi \n2024, 8–10), an oncology policy library (Bagchi 2024, 10–12), and a medi-\ncal college library (Bagchi 2024, 12–14) of the same macro domain, can-\ncer, are illustrated in the example. Notice that the commonality in the \nperception of the three different communities is indicated by their shared \nperceived concept of cancer specialized by its various types (breast cancer, \nlung cancer, etc.) and described by common properties (e.g., biomarkers \nassociated with a cancer). However, major differences emerge in the three \nperceptions due to their very purpose in studying the same entity. The \ncancer research library user community is interested in concepts such as \nresearch study types, treatments, and other properties, for example, the \nclinical trial ID and pathology report text. The oncology policy library \nuser community, on the other hand, is interested in policy documents \nsuch as clinical guidelines, best practices, regulatory policy, and so on. \nThe medical college library user community is interested in medical study, \nstudy material, treatment approach, and so forth. The full transcript pro-\nvides more details on differences in perception (Bagchi 2024, 15–18). It is \ninteresting to notice the representational manifoldness between the same \n(domain) entities and how they are variously perceived as concepts.\nSecond, let us focus on the terminological entanglement that implies \nthe necessary existence of a many-to-many mapping between perceived \nconcepts and their lexicalization using a terminological label. As briefly \nmentioned earlier, linguistic phenomena are a key inducer of representa-\ntional manifoldness at this level. For example, polysemous terms labeling \n metadata modeling / bagchi 309\na perceived concept provide at best an ambiguous notion of its meaning \nand magnify the many-to-many possibilities for the metadata librarian. On \nthe other hand, the central problem with synonyms is the establishment \nof mapping. Given implicitly synonymous terms, it might not always be \nstraightforward for the metadata librarian to infer whether they are the \nsame or synonymous or a broader/narrower/distinct term. The above \nproblems are further compounded in settings that involve multiple lan-\nguages and/or multiple communities of different genres of academic li-\nbrary users. To exemplify, in the motivating example, let us consider the \nsingular case of the concept “breast cancer” (Bagchi 2024, 8). It can be \ntermed variously by different communities of library users as carcinoma \nof the breast, mammary carcinoma, breast tissue malignant neoplasm, or \nlobular adenocarcinoma. In multilingual metadata modeling settings, the \nsame concept can be referred to as, for instance, cancer du sein in French, \ncáncer de mama in Catalan, or rakovina prsu in Czech. While technologies \nfrom natural language processing can be harnessed to implement some \nof these semantic (non)equivalences, it is crucial for the metadata librar -\nian to first diagnose and understand the entanglement and manifoldness \nexistent in the equivalency mapping.\nThird, given the elucidation of terminological entanglement, let us \nnow elaborate the notion of ontological entanglement, which refers to \nthe necessary existence of a many-to-many mapping between labeled con-\ncepts and their ontological commitment. Two interlinked dimensions un-\nderlie the above entanglement. First, due to perceptual and subsequent \nterminological entanglement, different communities of library users can \nperceive and label the same entity differently, thereby bootstrapping the \nmany-to-many mapping between different entities/concepts and the \ndifferent top-level ontological categories they might potentially be cat-\negorized into. Second, as a consequence of the first reason, different \ncommunities of library users, unknowingly and implicitly, commit to the \nphilosophical doctrine of one of the state-of-the-art top-level ontologies, \nthereby adding a second layer of many-to-many entanglement between \nentities and top-level ontological theories (see, e.g., Gangemi et al. 2002; \nGuizzardi et al. 2022; Smith et al. 2005). The ontological entanglement \nresulting in a multiplicity of representational manifoldness between labeled \nconcepts and their top-level ontological characterization, in effect, trans-\nlates into application-level implementational entanglements such as the \nmanagement of interoperability and harvesting of metadata in networked \nacademic library settings (Taha 2012). To exemplify, in the motivating \nexample, let us consider the ontological entanglement in the oncology \npolicy library metadata model (Bagchi 2024, 27). Notice that the same \nconcept of a “policy document” has been categorized into different onto-\nlogical categories (Information Object, Artifact, Continuant) by different \ntop-level ontologies (DOLCE, UFO, BFO), respectively. Further, each of \n[91.100.61.210]   Project MUSE (2025-11-05 17:26 GMT)\n310 library trends/february 2025\nthese categories can be instantiated for various other labeled concepts, \nfor example, textbook (Bagchi 2024, 28) (having a different semantics).\nFourth, with the assumption of ontological entanglement and onto-\nlogical constraints, let us now elucidate the taxonomical entanglement \nsubproblem, which refers to the necessary existence of a many-to-many \nmapping between ontologically enriched concepts and their taxonomic \nclassification that would eventually constitute the backbone of a library \nmetadata model. Four key parameters, from Ranganathan’s (1967, 1989) \nfaceted classification theory, induce representational manifoldness at this \nstage. First, with respect to a concept at a specific level of abstraction in the \ntaxonomy, there are always multiple characteristics that can be employed \nto taxonomically specialize that concept into (potentially many) subordi-\nnate concepts. Second, the successive application of characteristics across \nthe entire depth of taxonomy (with the possibility of multiple classifica-\ntory characteristics at each level of abstraction) leads to potentially infi-\nnite entangled classifications. Third and fourth, there can also be multiple \nways in which concepts can be organized horizontally across a specific \nlevel of taxonomic abstraction (termed arrays in Ranganathan 1967) and \nvertically across a taxonomic path (termed chains in Ranganathan 1967), \nrespectively. In the motivating example, the author used ChatGPT 3.5 to \nelicit the LLM response to the prompt requesting the taxonomical choices \nmade (Bagchi 2024, 30–34). Note that the human-LLM prompt collabora-\ntion, although simplistic, returns two equally probable but different entan-\ngled taxonomies for the oncology policy library user community (Bagchi \n2024, 31). It is interesting to observe that in example 1 the taxonomy is \nimplicitly suited for a library metadata model on a social health care policy \nperspective, whereas in example 2 the taxonomy is implicitly suited for a \nlibrary metadata model on a governmental health care policy perspective.\nLast but not least, with the assumption of taxonomical entanglement, \nlet us now elucidate the problem of definitional entanglement, which re-\nfers to the necessary existence of a many-to-many mapping between the \ntaxonomic concepts and their interrelation and description via proper -\nties. Two key factors magnify representational manifoldness in this final \nstage. First, during the final decision to characterize a property (uncov-\nered at the ontological level) as an object or a data property, there exists \na many-to-many mapping as the same property can be represented and \nrefactored as an object or a data property depending on the purposes and \ngoals to be served by the library metadata model. Second, a concept in the \ntaxonomy can be interrelated and described via multiple possible com-\nbinations of sets of object and data properties, again, depending on the \nprecise purpose of the final metadata model. In the motivating example, \nthe author used ChatGPT 3.5 to elicit the LLM response to the prompt \nrequesting the object and data property choices made (Bagchi 2024, 34–\n39). For example, the human-LLM collaboration example generated two \n metadata modeling / bagchi 311\nequally probable but different sets of object and data properties implicitly \nsuited for the medical students and medical study participants user com-\nmunity of a medical college library, respectively (Bagchi 2024, 36).\nFinally, the aforementioned individual level-by-level representational \nmanifoldness is accumulative in nature, and, therefore, there is also an \noverall manifoldness between entities and their taxonomy and defini-\ntional characterization. In the motivating example, the author used Chat-\nGPT 3.5 to elicit the LLM response to the prompt requesting the overall \nmany-to-many mapping between entities, taxonomical hierarchies, and \nproperty-based characterization (Bagchi 2024, 39–43). For example, even \nwithin the same macro domain of discourse, cancer, different perceptions \nby the three different communities of library users (cancer specialists, \noncology policy experts, and medical college professionals) generated \nmultiple terminologies, ontological categories, taxonomies, and property \npredications, most of which are not in correspondence with each other. \nFurther, as also previously noted in the second section, it might well be the \ncase that for an application scenario, there might be no manifoldness in \nperception or in terminology or both (with, e.g., the other entanglements \nstill holding). In any case, the conceptual entanglement problem is a ge-\nneric characterization inherent and implicit by design in any library meta-\ndata model and should be adapted as necessary on a case-by-case basis.\nToward Generative AI–Driven Disentangled  \nMetadata Modeling\nAfter the elucidation of how the conceptual entanglement problem is in-\nherent, by design, at each representation level, let us now describe in de-\ntail how a metadata librarian can exploit the conceptual disentanglement \napproach, via generative AI–driven, human-LLM collaboration, to disentangle \nentangled metadata within the framework of an academic library. To that \nend, we have the following:\n1. Perceptual disentanglement, referring to the explicit representational \nbijection between entities and their perception as concepts;\n2. Terminological disentanglement, referring to the explicit representa-\ntional bijection between perceived concepts and the terminology used \nto linguistically label them;\n3. Ontological disentanglement, referring to the explicit representational \nbijection between labeled concepts and their ontological commitment;\n4. Taxonomical disentanglement, referring to the explicit representational \nbijection between ontologically characterized concepts and their precise \ntaxonomy;\n5. Definitional disentanglement, referring to the explicit representational \nbijection between the taxonomic concepts and their definition via prop-\nerties.\n312 library trends/february 2025\nIn order to exemplify this stratification, the same motivating example of \nthe ontology-driven library metadata model for the cancer domain is em-\nployed (Bagchi 2024, 8–43). Notice also the fact that this stratification of \nconceptual disentanglement is in sync with both the stratification of con-\nceptual entanglement and the stratification of representation in metadata \nproposed in the second and the third sections, respectively. The above \nlevels are elucidated as follows.\nFirst, let us concentrate on the perceptual disentanglement subap-\nproach that advocates, on the part of the metadata librarian (i.e., the mod-\neler), deciding on an explicit one-to-one mapping between entities and their \nperception as concepts. As described and exemplified in the third section, \neven for the same (domain) entities, there is an inherent representational \nmanifoldness that entangles the resultant library metadata model. Two \nkey factors underlie the disentanglement approach of a metadata librar -\nian at this level. First, the metadata librarian has to generate, via prompt \nengineering (similar to that in the motivating example), an initial charac-\nterization of the perception they want to follow in designing the metadata \nmodel. Notice that the goals and purposes such a model would potentially \nserve are a key influence on the design of prompts at this stage to elicit a \nreasonable response from the LLM. Given an initial record of perception \ngenerated via the above human-LLM collaboration, the next crucial step \nfor the metadata librarian is to employ a combination of several standard \ntechniques to validate and consolidate the generated perception depend-\ning on the criticality of the use of the metadata model. To that end, they can \nconduct a lightweight digital ethnographic exercise (Varis 2015) about the \nuser community and its perception about a domain. The librarian can also \nemploy focus groups (Morgan 1996) and/or one-to-one consultation with \ndomain experts (Drabenstott 2003) to better understand a community’s \nviewpoint about entities of a specific domain. Further, independently or in \naddition to the above, the metadata librarian can perform an information \nand data validation exercise wherein they explore real-life information \nand data resources produced by a user community to gauge its percep-\ntions about a domain or even, if available, reuse existing conceptual dis-\nentanglement documentation (thereby reinforcing the spiral nature of \nthe levels). Finally, the above inputs can be consolidated to validate/re-\npair/enrich the initial perception and, hence, facilitate disentangling the \nperceptual entanglement. To exemplify, in the motivating example, the \nmetadata librarian, after the perception validation exercise, might choose \nto add a new concept multi-omics workflow and related properties to the \nperception already generated by the human-LLM collaboration for a can-\ncer research library user community. Notice also the fact that the initial \nperception generated via the LLM prompting also reduces to a significant \nextent the otherwise laborious exercise of domain analysis on the part of \nthe metadata librarian (Hjørland and Albrechtsen 1995).\n metadata modeling / bagchi 313\nSecond, assuming the representational bijection at the perceptual level, \nlet us now focus on terminological disentanglement, which advocates, on \nthe part of the metadata librarian, deciding on an explicit one-to-one map-\nping between perceived concepts and the terminology that would com-\npose the disentangled library metadata model. The guiding cardinal rule \nthat a metadata librarian can employ for disentanglement at the termi-\nnology level can be referred to as the principle of user warrant. It is based \non the generalized notion of warrant in information science (Lancaster \n1972; Nylund 2020) and can be understood as the principle to assign to \na perceived concept a linguistically disambiguated and semantically ex-\nplicit term that is based on the documented warrant of the (expert) li-\nbrary users. To that end, each (meta)data concept/property term label \nshould embody standard terminological quality, such as having a natural \nlanguage gloss, examples, identifiers, and so on (Miller 1995). There are \nseveral (combinations of) options that a metadata librarian can exploit \nto achieve representational bijection of terminology. If the user warrant \nis to use relatively commonsense terms to refer to concepts of cancer, for \nexample, in an oncology policy library, lexical-semantic resources such \nas WordNet (Miller 1995) might be exploited to achieve the representa-\ntional bijection. On the other hand, if the user warrant in a specialized \ncancer research library is to refer to concepts of cancer using scientific \nterms, resources such as specialized glossaries and health care/clinical \nterminological standards (Schulz et al. 2019) can be exploited to achieve \nan explicit one-to-one mapping. Further, in multilingual settings, natural \nlanguage processing resources such as multilingual variations of WordNet \nand WordNet-like resources (Dash et al. 2017; Navigli and Ponzetto 2012; \nPianta et al. 2002) and/or open multilingual knowledge bases such as \nWikidata (Vrandečić and Krötzsch 2014) can be exploited to disentangle \nand disambiguate terms.\nThird, assuming the representational bijection at the terminological \nlevel, let us move to the next activity of ontological disentanglement, \naccording to which the metadata librarian has to decide on an explicit \none-to-one mapping between labeled concepts and their ontological com-\nmitment. Similar to the disentanglement strategy at the terminological \nlevel, the general guidance of user warrant is key to uncovering the onto-\nlogical commitment of library users at this level. To that end, the metadata \nlibrarian can apply a four-stage approach. First, the librarian can prompt \nan LLM such as ChatGPT 3.5 appropriately (see, for instance, the exam-\nples in the motivating example at Bagchi 2024, 23–29) to bootstrap an \ninitial “entangled” version of the alignment of the library metadata model \nwith different state-of-the-art top-level ontologies. Second, the librarian \ncan reuse the outputs and documentation of focus group interviews, do-\nmain expert consultation, and/or relevant conceptual disentanglement \ndocumentation to understand the ontological warrant of the community \n[91.100.61.210]   Project MUSE (2025-11-05 17:26 GMT)\n314 library trends/february 2025\nof library users they are attending to. Third, the librarian can use the re-\nsults of the second step to explicitly choose and enrich the best possible \nontological fit among the different ontology alignments produced in the \nfirst step. Finally, the metadata librarian should explicate the ontological \ncategories of each individual labeled concept and property that is under \nconsideration with respect to the chosen top-level ontology.\nFourth, assuming the representational bijection at the ontological level, \nlet us now concentrate on taxonomical disentanglement, which advocates, \non the part of the metadata librarian, deciding on an explicit one-to-one \nmapping between ontologically characterized concepts and their precise \ntaxonomy. Given the general direction from the needs of the library and \ninformation service(s) that would exploit the final library metadata model, \nthe metadata librarian can follow a four-step disentanglement strategy in \nresponse to the four stages of taxonomical entanglement (see the third \nsection of the paper). The solution is grounded in the canons of knowledge \nclassification proposed by Ranganathan (1967, 1989) in his faceted classifi-\ncation theory. First, the canons of characteristics (Ranganathan 1967), such \nas canons of relevance and ascertainability, should be applied to elimi-\nnate manifoldness at the level of selecting a classificatory characteristic \nfor specializing concepts at a specific level of abstraction in the taxonomy. \nSecond, the canons of succession of characteristics (Ranganathan 1967), such \nas the canon of relevant succession, should be applied to disentangle the \nmultiplicity existent in how classificatory characteristics are successively ap-\nplied to design the conceptual depth of the taxonomy. Third and fourth, \nthe canons of arrays and chains (Ranganathan 1967) should be applied to \ndisentangle the manifoldness existent while modeling concepts across a \nspecific horizontal level and across a path of the taxonomy, respectively. \nTo aid the above exercise, the metadata librarian can also consult and \nreuse relevant state-of-the-art taxonomies if available as open-source code. \nFinally, the above procedure is expected to generate an enriched and dis-\nentangled version of one of the many possibilities initially generated via \nhuman-LLM collaboration, for example, as exemplified in the motivating \nexample (Bagchi 2024, 30–34).\nLast but not the least, assuming the representational bijection at the \ntaxonomical level, let us move to the final activity of definitional disen-\ntanglement, according to which the metadata librarian has to decide on \nan explicit one-to-one mapping between the taxonomic concepts and \ntheir interrelation and description via properties. To that end, the librar -\nian can proceed on a two-step strategy. First, they should make explicit a \nfinal decision on the exact split of properties into two distinct sets: a set \nof object properties and a set of data properties. This decision is critically \ninfluenced by the information service applications driven by the warrant \nof a specific community of library users. Given the first step, the next step \nis to make explicit the decisions on exactly how the object properties would \n metadata modeling / bagchi 315\nbe exploited to interlink the concepts in the disentangled taxonomy, in \nother words, determining the precise conceptual domain and ranges of \nthe object properties. Further, perhaps most importantly, the librarian \nshould determine the exact set of data properties that should describe each \nconcept in the taxonomy (also factoring in the taxonomic inheritance). \nTogether, the above steps can facilitate a representational bijection and, \nthereby, generate the final disentangled ontology-driven library metadata \nmodel out of the many entangled possibilities initially generated via gen-\nerative AI–driven human-LLM collaboration, for example, as exemplified \nin the motivating example (Bagchi 2024, 34–39).\nThere are three key observations with respect to the aforementioned \nelucidation of the levels of conceptual disentanglement. First, as in the \nsecond and the third section, it might well be the case that for a spe-\ncific application scenario, implementing the conceptual disentanglement \nexercise is relevant only for specific representation levels and not for all \nfive levels together. Second, notice that the disentanglement at each of \nthe above levels is effectuated by human-LLM collaboration via appropri-\nate prompt engineering. It is definitely the case that in some levels, for \nexample, ontological and taxonomical disentanglement, human model-\ners should be more involved than LLMs due to the very conceptual and \nsemantics-intensive nature of disentanglement. On the other hand, the \ninitial responses generated by LLMs can speed up the bootstrapping of \nmodeling metadata by several counts. Notice also the fact that human over-\nsight, even if not demanding, is crucial at each level to minimize the effect \nof so-called LLM hallucinations (Chomsky et al. 2023; Rawte et al. 2023). \nFinally, the conceptual disentanglement exercise should be formally docu-\nmented as a datasheet (Gebru et al. 2021) for possible future reuse, with all \nthe decisions concerning the disentanglement of the manifoldness into \none-to-one correspondences clearly explicated.\nResearch Implications for Libraries and Beyond\nThe deconstruction of a library metadata model as composed of five \ndisentangled representation levels is a novel way of thinking about li-\nbrary metadata and is directly linked to some of the AI, metadata, and \nsemantics-based research issues that academic libraries are increasingly \ngrappling with. To that end, let us focus on general perspectives relevant \nto related work in library metadata and library knowledge discovery; FAIR \ndata and metadata; and AI, generative AI, and academic libraries vis-à-vis \nthe conceptual entanglement and disentanglement metadata modeling \nproposal advanced in the current work. Each of the perspectives is indi-\nvidually discussed as follows.\nKnowledge discovery, according to the highly cited Fayyad et al., can \nbe defined as “the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, poten-\ntially useful and ultimately understandable patterns or knowledge in data” \n316 library trends/february 2025\n(1996, 37). Notice that in the quoted definition what is assumed a priori \nis the notion of user warrant-based data modeling and data annotation, \nwithout which eliciting patterns from such data would be an uphill task. \nIn fact, some of the assumptions (alongside many others) were alluded to \nin later works (e.g., Pazzani 2000). Notice that metadata-based data mod-\neling and annotation is key to digital infrastructures such as the digital \nlibraries (Borgman 1999) and discovery services (Vaughan 2011) of aca-\ndemic libraries, which host and expose key assets for the academic library \nuser community, especially the community of data science researchers, to \nengage in algorithmic knowledge discovery. To that end, the mainstream \nresearch in library metadata (see, e.g., Coyle 2015; Dunsire and Willer \n2010, 2011; Peponakis 2013) has overwhelmingly concentrated on devel-\noping metadata schemata (which is key) but has, at best, underconsid-\nered the key spectrum of human factors in modeling metadata. This has \nled to long-standing issues with knowledge discovery in academic librar -\nies (Richardson et al. 2008), metadata crosswalks (Khoo and Hall 2010), \nmetadata and data interoperability (Pagano et al. 2013), and so on. More \nrecently, the CILIP research report has suggested enhanced emphasis on \nthe human and social aspect and termed knowledge discovery a sociotechnical \nprocess (Cox 2021). The proposal of generative AI–driven conceptual dis-\nentanglement in this work across the five representation levels, right from \n(human) perception to the formalization of a library metadata model, can \ncontribute as a research catalyst to this underresearched theme. Moreover, \nthe level-by-level disentanglement of a library metadata model can form \nthe base for developing incremental frameworks and methodologies for \nattenuating the impact of, for example, metadata non-interoperability and \nskewed crosswalks.\nThe current work is also directly related to the upsurge of research on \nFAIR data (Wilkinson et al. 2016), or data that is Findable, Accessible, In-\nteroperable, and Reusable. As stated in its original vision (Wilkinson et al. \n2016), the effort to make data (or, in general, an information resource) \nFAIR involves a dedicated metadata strategy on the part of the implement-\ning entity. Academic libraries and the library metadata community have \nbeen quick to incorporate the FAIR vision (especially the Findability and \nAccessibility dimensions) and have been successful in the technological \ninfrastructure (e.g., data catalogs) backing a stand-alone FAIR implemen-\ntation (e.g., see Hettne et al. 2020; Koster and Woutersen-Windhouwer \n2018). However, as the current proposal of conceptual disentanglement \nshows, FAIRification is a multilevel strategy encompassing all five repre-\nsentation levels: perception, terminology, ontology, taxonomy, and defini-\ntional characterization. This is key, especially for the Interoperability and \nReusability dimensions, as there can be non-interoperability in each of the \nfive representation levels due to representational manifoldness leading to \nnon-reusability of digital data and information (thereby also defeating the \n metadata modeling / bagchi 317\noverall purpose of FAIR). Additionally, the above aspect reinforces the \nimportance of ontology-driven metadata modeling, as, without an ontol-\nogy structuring and consolidating the (meta)data properties, it is next to \nimpossible, as per the current technology toolbox, to achieve interoper -\nability and reusability for both data and ontology (e.g., see Carriero et al. \n2020 and Fernández-López et al. 2019 for related issues and problems). \nFinally, while the conceptual disentanglement framework is innovative in \nits vision of level-by-level FAIRification, it runs the risk of overwhelming \nintellectual work on the part of a metadata librarian.\nFinally, on a more abstract note, the current work is reviewed in terms \nof how AI in general and generative AI in particular have impacted aca-\ndemic librarians, information professionals, and users. The CILIP report \nprovides a well-rounded bird’s-eye view as to how AI is going to shape the \nacademic library space in the years to come (Cox 2021). The possibilities \nof generative AI applications in academic libraries encompass a rich spec-\ntrum of information-intensive activities, including, among others, intelli-\ngent web and mobile search, sociotechnical infrastructures for knowledge \ndiscovery, chatbots, marketing and user behavior elicitation, robotics, data \nscience community-building, and data stewardship. Notice three dimen-\nsions that are key to the sociotechnical toolbox required to conceptualize and \nimplement all of the above activities. First, all of the above activities depend \non the involvement of humans, particularly the warrant of library users but \nalso the technical expertise and knowledge of academic librarians and \nother information professionals. Second, all of the above activities also \ndepend on the involvement of machines, in other words, computers and \ncomputing infrastructures, to semiautonomously implement digital infor-\nmation services and increase their usage penetration among users. Third, \nall of the above activities crucially depend on metadata, which forms the \nglue between humans (helping them discover and retrieve data, infor -\nmation, and knowledge from machines) and machines (to exploit and \nfine-tune user warrant, services, and information discoverability). In this \ncontext, the current proposal of a conceptual disentanglement strategy for \nmodeling library metadata via generative AI–driven human-LLM collabo-\nration contributes to all three dimensions. The strategy involves humans \n(metadata librarians as semantic modelers and users), machines (genera-\ntive AI technology [Fui-Hoon Nah et al. 2023; Sætra 2023; Stokel-Walker \nand Van Noorden 2023] in the form of LLMs), and a strategy to model \ndisentangled metadata via greater human-AI collaboration.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, this paper presented a novel generative AI–driven \nhuman-LLM collaboration approach to model disentangled library meta-\ndata free from several levels of representational entanglements that can \notherwise have unintended technological consequences. To that end, the \n[91.100.61.210]   Project MUSE (2025-11-05 17:26 GMT)\n318 library trends/february 2025\npaper advanced three key contributions. First, it introduced a novel way \nof thinking about library metadata in terms of a composition of five func-\ntionally interlinked representation levels from perception to definition \nvia properties. Second, it introduced the implicit representational mani-\nfoldness existent in each of the five levels that cumulatively contributes \nto a conceptually entangled library metadata model. Third, it proposed a \ngenerative AI–driven human-LLM collaboration-based conceptual disen-\ntanglement approach to disentangle the entanglement inherent, level by \nlevel, in the metadata model, leading to a disentangled metadata model \nthat is validated, explanatory, and continually enriched via a spiral pro-\ncess. Some of the future research lines in this direction can include a \nnew conceptually disentangled interpretation of FAIR (meta)data in li-\nbraries, elevating the approach to a full-fledged general metadata model-\ning methodology beyond libraries, and a detailed cost-benefit analysis of \nthe human-LLM collaboration dimension in conceptual disentanglement. \nThe testing of the proposed approach employing open-source state-of-the-\nart LLMs other than ChatGPT, a stated limitation in this paper, could also \nbe a potential future research study.\nReferences\nAndrikopoulou, Angeliki, Jennifer Rowley, and Geoff Walton. 2022. “Research Data Manage-\nment (RDM) and the Evolving Identity of Academic Libraries and Librarians: A Literature \nReview.” New Review of Academic Librarianship 28 (4): 349–65. https://doi.org/10.1080  \n/13614533.2021.1964549.\nArp, Robert, and Barry Smith. 2008. “Function, Role, and Disposition in Basic Formal Ontol-\nogy.” Nature Precedings. https://doi.org/10.1038/npre.2008.1941.1.\nBagchi, Mayukh. 2019. “A Knowledge Architecture Using Knowledge Graphs.” Master’s thesis, \nIndian Statistical Institute.\nBagchi, Mayukh. 2020. “Conceptualising a Library Chatbot Using Open Source Conversa-\ntional Artificial Intelligence.” DESIDOC Journal of Library & Information Technology 40 (6).\nBagchi, Mayukh. 2021a. “A Large Scale, Knowledge Intensive Domain Development Meth-\nodology.” Knowledge Organization 48 (1): 8–23.\nBagchi, Mayukh. 2021b. “Towards Knowledge Organization Ecosystem (KOE).” Cataloging & \nClassification Quarterly 59 (8): 740–56. https://doi.org/10.1080/01639374.2021.1998282.\nBagchi, Mayukh. 2022a. “A Diversity-Aware Domain Development Methodology.” In Proceedings \nof the ER Forum and PhD Symposium 2022, edited by Sebastian Link, Iris Reinhartz-Berger, \nJelena Zdravkovic, Dominik Bork, and Srinath Srinivasa.
