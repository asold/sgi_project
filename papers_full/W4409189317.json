In the pre-digital era, students relied on \nface-to-face interactions with educators and printed materials, fostering a classroom-centered model of learning that \nemphasized rote memorization and repetitive practice [1, 2]. While effective for foundational knowledge, this approach \noften struggled to address individual student needs and adapt to diverse learning styles [3]. The introduction of comput-\ners in education in the late twentieth century marked a pivotal shift. Educational software, interactive tutorials, and early \nlearning management systems (LMS) allowed educators to expand their pedagogical toolkit. Computers became tools \n * Vivek Bhardwaj, vivek.bhardwaj@jaipur.manipal.edu | 1School of Computer Science & Engineering, Manipal University Jaipur, Jaipur, \nIndia 303007. 2Advanced Centre of Research & Innovation (ACRI), Department of Computer Application, Chandigarh School of Business, \nChandigarh Group of Colleges Jhanjeri, Mohali, Punjab, India 140307. 3ASET, Amity University Punjab, Mohali, India.\nVol:.(1234567890)\nReview  \nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z\nfor both teachers and students, enabling access to vast digital repositories of information and laying the groundwork for \nself-directed learning [4, 5]. Technologies such as video-based tutorials and online discussion forums further enhanced \ncollaborative and experiential learning. However, these systems lacked the adaptability and personalization that AI would \nlater bring to education [6]. The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) introduced unpredictable possibilities for new ways of \nlearning. Systems driven by AI could analyze student behavior, adapt content delivery, and provide personalized feedback \n[7, 8]. Among the most transformative innovations in this domain were large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, which \nemerged as versatile tools capable of simulating human-like conversation and generating high-quality content [7 , 9]. \nBy integrating AI into education, students and educators gained access to real-time problem-solving, creative content \ngeneration, and enhanced language learning [5, 6]. Nevertheless, concerns about dependency, ethical issues, and equity \nin access remained prominent [4, 10].\nIn recent years, the field has witnessed another significant milestone: the development of local, open sourced, online, \nhybridized architecture pretrained model’s, one such architecture is on-device LLMs such as Meta’s, Microsoft’s, Mistral \nAI large language models (like Llama 3 and other Companies models: Phi-3, Mistral 7B, Falcon 180B, etc.) [5 , 6]. Unlike \ncloud-based solutions, these models can be operated directly on personal devices, ensuring improved data privacy \nmodels for faster response times, and the ability to function offline.\nFigure 1 illustrates this progression—from traditional learning methods to cutting-edge AI applications highlighting \nhow these technological advancements are bridging global innovations with localized applications. Local LLMs are par-\nticularly significant in addressing educational disparities by enabling resource-limited regions to benefit from AI-driven \nlearning tools [4 , 5]. Furthermore, these models empower educators to customize curriculum based on cultural and \ncontextual needs, fostering inclusivity and innovation [5 , 10]. The integration of local LLMs into new smart classrooms \nand personal devices signals a new era of enhanced knowledge acquisition and collaboration. These tools not only sup-\nport critical thinking and problem-solving but also enable students to actively participate in interdisciplinary projects, \nnurturing a generation of learners equipped for a rapidly evolving world [4 ].\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, the convergence of technological advancements highlights the transformative potential of inno-\nvation in shaping equitable, dynamic, and impactful educational ecosystems. This evolution necessitates collaboration \nbetween educators and policymakers to leverage AI responsibly while addressing challenges, ensuring that education \nremains a powerful tool for universal empowerment and progress [1 , 4]. Human ingenuity, with its ability to think out -\nside the box and develop novel approaches, is pivotal. Instead of merely enhancing existing methods, such as making \nhorses run faster, why not invent something entirely new—like a car or another faster mode of transportation? Such \ngroundbreaking ideas have driven rapid technological advancements across various sectors.\nFast forward to today, where a student interacts with a smart, AI-enabled learning environment powered by large \nlanguage models (LLMs), receiving personalized feedback and adaptive content tailored to their unique learning style. \nThis remarkable shift underscores the revolutionary journey of education, propelled by technological progress and \nour deepening understanding of how humans learn. Consider the following compelling statistics: A meta-analysis of \n50 studies revealed that students using intelligent tutoring systems outperformed 75% of their peers in traditional \nclassrooms [11]. The global AI in education market is projected to reach $20.2 billion by 2027, with a compound \nFig. 1  Evolution of technol-\nogy in educational history\n\nVol.:(0123456789)\nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z \n \n Review\nannual growth rate (CAGR) of 45.12% from 2020 to 2027 [12]. Within the next three years, 47% of learning manage -\nment tools are expected to integrate AI capabilities [13].\nThese data points depict a future where AI becomes a fundamental component of education, rather than just \nan auxiliary tool. Advanced Personalized AI Learning Systems (APALS), including intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), \nindividualized learning platforms (ILPs), automated grading systems (AGS), and dynamic content generation (DCG) \ntools, are at the forefront of this revolution. Envision a world where every student has access to a personalized AI \ntutor—available 24/7, adapting in real time to individual needs and learning speeds. This vision is not science fic -\ntion but an imminent reality. To explore this paradigm shift, it is imperative to examine how AI-powered, customized \nlearning systems—particularly those driven by LLMs—enhance student knowledge acquisition compared to tradi-\ntional teaching methodologies. Understanding their impact on information retention and cognitive development \nis essential for the future of education, especially as AI-based platforms offer adaptive learning paths, real-time \nfeedback, and tailored instructional strategies.\n2  Literatur review\nThe integration of AI and large language models (LLMs) into the educational field can reshape traditional learning \nmethods, enhancing user-specific personalization and engagement. Many studies reveal that AI-driven systems \ncan adapt to individual student needs, improving academic outcomes through customized content and real-time \nfeedback. Unlike traditional methods, where static curricula may not address diverse learning styles, AI tools provide \ndynamic and multimodal experiences, helping bridge gaps in student understanding. Moreover, generative AI and \nLLMs foster interactive learning environments, aiding students in acquiring problem-solving skills compared to \ntraditional education environments. Figure  2 illustrates the overlapping aspects between new-age and traditional \nlearning methods.\n2.1  Traditional education patterns\nTraditional education is often characterized by teacher-led instruction, standardized content delivery, and limited \npersonalization. According to a review by Hattie [14], traditional education approaches have shown varying degrees \nof effectiveness depending on factors like teaching quality, student engagement, and classroom environment. How -\never, critiques of this system often highlight its rigidity, limited student autonomy, and failure to handle the indi-\nvidual learning styles. Piaget’s [15] theory of cognitive development and Vygotsky’s [16] social constructivist theory \nlaid much of the groundwork for these traditional models, emphasizing structured learning environments and the \nimportance of social interaction in education. Despite its widespread use, several studies have shown that tradi-\ntional methods often result in disengaged students and limited long-term retention of knowledge. Research done \nby Govaerts et al. [17] indicated that passive learning methods and rote memorization can contribute to decreased \nstudent motivation, as they often fail to provide the flexibility or real-world application that many students require.\nFig. 2  Overlapping aspects \nof new-age and traditional \nlearning\n\nVol:.(1234567890)\nReview  \nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z\n2.2  AI‑based learning\nRecent studies highlight the integration of AI in mathematics education, focusing on adoption, literacy, and teacher \nknowledge. One study reveals that performance expectancy significantly influences preservice teachers’ intention \nto use AI chatbots, emphasizing the need for targeted workshops to enhance adoption [18]. Latent Profile Analysis \nof AI Literacy and Trust in Mathematics Teachers identifies five distinct profiles of AI literacy and trust, showing that \nhigher literacy and trust levels correlate with increased AI dependency, which may negatively impact essential \nskills like critical thinking and problem-solving. The study calls for a balanced approach to AI integration to prevent \nskill erosion [19]. Teachers’ AI-TPACK: Exploring the Relationship between Knowledge Elements introduces the AI-TPACK \nframework, examining the complex interplay between technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge elements. \nThe study finds that technical knowledge elements strongly predict AI-TPACK effectiveness, emphasizing the need \nfor comprehensive teacher training to enhance AI integration sustainably. Collectively, these studies highlight the \nimportance of fostering positive AI attitudes, balancing AI use, and providing targeted professional development to \noptimize AI’s role in mathematics education [20].\nOn the other hand, AI-based learning systems, particularly those driven by LLMs (like GPT-4 or BERT), offer an alter -\nnative that addresses many of the shortcomings of traditional education. Personalized AI-driven learning platforms \nuse algorithms to adapt to individual student needs, adjusting the difficulty of material, pacing, and instructional \nstyle in real-time. According to Zawacki-Richter et al. [21], AI in education has been shown to significantly improve \nlearning outcomes by providing tailored feedback and immediate support. A meta-analysis by Wang et al. [22] dem-\nonstrated that students using AI-based platforms showed improved knowledge retention and engagement compared \nto those in traditional learning environments. One key advantage of AI-based learning lies in its adaptive nature. As \ndescribed by Luckin et al. [ 23], AI can dynamically adjust the learning path based on a student’s performance, ensur -\ning a continuous challenge while minimizing frustration. This personalized approach caters to a broader range of \nlearning styles and paces, making it more inclusive. Additionally, AI models like LLMs have revolutionized learning \ncontent generation by understanding natural language queries and providing detailed, contextualized responses \nthat enhance the learning experience. These findings underscore the need for balanced AI use and targeted profes-\nsional development to enhance teaching outcomes.\n2.3  Effectiveness of AI‑based learning vs. Traditional methods\nSeveral studies suggest that personalized AI-based learning has the potential to outperform traditional methods. Hol-\nstein et al. [24] found that AI-based tutoring systems improved student performance by providing immediate feedback \nand personalized learning strategies. Another study by Roll and Wylie [25] emphasized that AI-driven adaptive learning \nsystems can improve conceptual understanding, particularly in subjects like math and science, where individualized \npacing is critical. However, the transition to AI-powered learning is not without challenges. Critics argue that the reli-\nance on algorithms may result in students losing the social and emotional benefits of classroom learning, a factor well-\ndocumented in Bandura’s social learning theory [26]. Additionally, concerns about accessibility and equity in AI-driven \neducation are often raised, as not all students have equal access to the technology required to benefit from these systems.\nTable 1 highlights the differences between traditional education methods and AI-based learning systems, focusing \non key aspects such as personalized learning, adaptability, scalability, and resource efficiency. It demonstrates how \nAI-based systems offer enhanced customization and interactivity compared to conventional approaches.\n2.4  Case studies on the integration of ChatGPT in education\nIn recent years, the integration of ChatGPT and other AI tools into educational environments has sparked significant \ninterest and debate. Various case studies have explored its impact across different educational contexts, from enhanc -\ning student participation in online discussions to reshaping traditional performance evaluation methods. These \nstudies highlight both the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating AI into teaching and learning, offering \nvaluable insights for future educational practices and policy development. The Table  2 summarizes key findings from \nseveral such case studies, illustrating the diverse applications of ChatGPT in education.\nVol.:(0123456789)\nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z \n \n Review\nTable 1  Comparison of traditional education patterns and AI-based learning systems\nAspect Traditional education AI-based learning\nCharacteristics • Teacher-led instruction\n• Standardized curricula\n• Limited personalization\n• Personalized learning paths\n• Dynamic content generation\n• Real-time feedback and adaptation\nTheoretical foundations • Piaget’s Cognitive Development Theory (1970) [15]\n• Vygotsky’s Social Constructivist Theory (1978) [16]\n• Luckin et al.

This study uses a detrimental technique, using various forms of available data and \nresources of past investigation and current trends in education. Snyder proposed that a systematic or semi-systematic \nliterature review, or a review of secondary data, gives a more in-depth knowledge of the research phenomena [33]. \nBecause only studies, including meta-analyses, that have been done on the topic support the identification, analysis, \nunderstanding, and synthesis of the ways in which AI has affected and impacted education, this approach guarantees \nthat the study is empirically based, or evidence backed. To evaluate the various approaches, a qualitative study design \nthat incorporates topic analysis and qualitative content is often used.

Large Language Model (LLM)-based \neducational integrations have emerged as transformative tools in modern education. Unlike traditional methods, \nwhere access to mentor and informative resources is limited by location and schedule, Agentic LLMs environment \ndemocratizes education by providing interactive, personalized, and instantaneous feedback to students. According \nto Yarychev and Mentsiev [ 35], digital education broadens accessibility, enabling a “knowledge society” where learn -\ning is no longer constrained to physical spaces or other limitations.\nThus, students can use LLMs ethically to expand their knowledge in any field by engaging in prompt or natural \nlanguage conversations like those used by humans. Without constantly asking teachers, they got entangled on some \nquestions. The flowchart below depicts the new Agentic LLMs-based top-view progression of a student’s request \nthrough an agent-based system designed to generate appropriate responses or actions. Figure  5 presents a flowchart \ndemonstrating the operation of an Agent-based LLM.\nFig. 4  Study selection process \nflow\n\nVol:.(1234567890)\nReview  \nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z\n• Student Requested Prompt: The Student Requested Prompt represents the student’s input, such as a question, query, \nor task. In an educational setting, this could be a request for information, an explanation of a subject, or an evaluation \nquestion. This could range from requesting a summary of a course to seeking assistance with a specific problem or \ntopic.\n• Agent’s System: Once the student’s prompt is received, it is passed to the agent, which handles the decision-making \nprocess. This system is central to LLMs in education because it determines how the system will respond to the students’ \nrequest. The agent’s role is to manage the tools, memory, and planning involved in generating a suitable answer or \naction.\n• Tools: The tools block refers to the available resources or external systems that the agent can use to provide an answer \nor perform a task. In educational settings, these could include access to a database of educational content, computa-\ntional tools for solving problems (small example like a calculator for math problems), or other systems integrated with \nthe LLM to facilitate interactive learning (e.g., a code compiler or virtual classroom tools). Tools are used to support \nthe agent’s ability to generate an informative response.\n• Memory: This represents the storage or access to previous interactions, context, and personalized information. In an \neducational scenario, memory allows the agent to remember past conversations, adapt responses based on previous \nlearning, and personalize the experience for the student. For example, an LLM-based tutor could recall a student’s \nprogress in a course, adjust its explanations based on previous misunderstandings, and track progress over time.\n• Planning: The planning component focuses on how the agent organizes its responses. Based on the students’ request, \nthe system must plan how to generate an answer. In the context of LLMs, this could involve deciding whether to \nsearch for information, explain a concept in detail, give an example, or ask the student follow-up questions to clarify \ntheir request. This is particularly crucial in more complex queries where the agent needs to break down the task into \nsmaller steps or provide structured explanations.\n4.1  Do LLM‑based educational integration improve student engagement and retention compared \nto traditional methods?\nAI-powered Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming education by providing dynamic, personalized learning \nexperiences that overcome the limitations of traditional one-size-fits-all approaches. Unlike traditional strategies, which \nfrequently fail to effectively engage diverse learners, LLMs use advanced natural language processing and adaptive \nalgorithms to tailor content to each student’s needs. For example, personalized feedback, curriculum pacing, and real-\ntime assessments improve both engagement and comprehension, with studies indicating a 32% increase in student \nretention rates in AI-integrated learning environments [8].\nFig. 5  Flowchart showing \nhow agent based LLM works\n\nVol.:(0123456789)\nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z \n \n Review\nLLMs also promote inclusivity by supporting multiple languages and learning styles, which addresses the global chal-\nlenge of equitable education. According to a World Economic Forum [9] survey conducted in 2022, 64% of students who \nused AI tools outperformed their peers in traditional settings in terms of learning outcomes. These capabilities position \nLLMs as transformative educational tools that promote deeper learning, critical thinking, and long-term academic suc -\ncess. Agentic LLM’s Improved Impact’s on Student Learnings:\n4.1.1  Personalized learning\nLLM based AI-enabled educational systems or environments powered by Multiple Agent’s are sufficient at analyzing \nstudent progress in real-time through continues student interactions, allowing both teachers and AI agents to adapt \neducational content to meet specific needs. For instance, a student struggling with foundational mathematical concepts \ncan receive simpler explanations and additional exercises to solidify their understanding, while an advanced student can \naccess more challenging material to stay engaged. This level of customization goes far beyond the capacity of traditional \nclassroom settings, where teachers often face the challenge of addressing diverse learning paces and styles within a lim-\nited timeframe. Which allows teachers and smart LLMs agent’s capabilities to tailor educational content according to the \nlearner’s specific needs, strengths, and weaknesses. This personalization fosters a deeper engagement with the learner’s \nmind and keep students motivated and reduces disengagement due to irrelevant or overly complex material [36, 37]. \nResearch shows that personalized learning increases student retention rates and improves academic outcomes, making \nit a vital component of modern education. These systems are not limited to academic content; they can also integrate \nlearning resources for socio-emotional skills, encouraging holistic growth. Overall, by combining real-time analytics and \npersonalized strategies, LLM-driven learning systems pave the way for a more inclusive and impactful education system.\n4.1.2  Real‑time feedback and adaptation\nOne of the most transformative aspects of LLM-driven educational systems is their ability to provide real-time feedback \nand adaptation. Unlike traditional classroom settings where feedback is often delayed due to time constraints or the \noverwhelming student-to-teacher ratio, these LLMs based systems can instantly analyze responses and provide action-\nable suggestions. For instance, when a student submits an essay or answers a complex problem, the system not only \nidentifies errors but also explains the reasoning behind corrections, offering immediate guidance. This type of instant \nfeedback has been proven to significantly enhance learning outcomes by addressing misconceptions at the moment \nthey arise. Due to data access of student’s to LLMs can instantly analyze student’s responses and provide immediate, \nactionable feedbacks, enhancing student overall involvement in the learning process. This feedback mechanism is very \ndifficult in the traditionally driven education environment where in a classroom of 1 or 2 teachers are there to correct \nyou but due to LLM based Agentic flow each users can now get instant feedback and direction to resolve their issues \nand concerns about any topic’s in any subject, which lead to a good retention of engagement in study [36, 37]. Moreo-\nver, real-time feedback isn’t limited to academic tasks. These systems also offer emotional and motivational support, \nencouraging students when they feel stuck or overwhelmed. This combination of cognitive and emotional guidance \ntransforms the learning experience into a more engaging and supportive process. The integration of these systems into \neducation bridges the gap between traditional and modern learning, creating a more dynamic and responsive environ-\nment where students can thrive.\n4.1.3  Increased motivation through gamification\nNot everyone is a fan of old-school textbook based learning, where in some research it says people learn and under -\nstand more through visuals so, many AI-powered educational tools include visual gamified elements by introducing \nchallenges, levels, and rewards, these tools transform mundane learning tasks into exciting and engaging activities. For \nexample, a history lesson might become an interactive game where students “unlock” historical events by answering \nquestions correctly, while a math exercise could involve earning points while solving a mystery based math problem \nwhere agents provide clues to students time to time so that student can solve it [36]. Visual and interactive elements \nare especially effective for students who struggle with text-heavy content. Research shows that 65% of individuals are \nvisual learners, meaning they absorb information more effectively when it’s presented through images, videos, or other \nvisual formats. LLM-based systems capitalize on this by integrating vibrant graphics, animations, and even immersive \nsimulations to teach complex concepts. These engaging methods make learning feel less like a chore and more like an \nVol:.(1234567890)\nReview  \nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z\nadventure, fostering curiosity and enthusiasm among students. Additionally, gamification provides immediate gratifi-\ncation through rewards, which keeps students motivated to progress. This motivational boost isn’t limited to academic \ncontent; it also promotes soft skills like teamwork, problem-solving, and time management. By merging gamification \nwith personalized learning pathways, LLM-based systems create a holistic educational experience that caters to both \nacademic and emotional growth.\n4.1.4  Continuous learning pathways\nEducation should not end when a student leaves the classroom. One of the most remarkable contributions of AI-powered \nsystems, particularly those leveraging LLMs, is their ability to facilitate continuous learning pathways. These systems offer \na seamless transition between different stages of education, ensuring that students are always equipped with relevant \nand updated knowledge. For instance, an AI system can track a student’s progress throughout their academic career, \nrecommending advanced courses, supplementary resources, or even career-oriented skill development programs as they \nadvance. This flexibility greatly enhances retention, as students are not confined to static curricula [36, 37]. Moreover, \nthese systems can identify gaps in a student’s understanding and address them proactively, preventing the accumula-\ntion of knowledge deficits. For example, a student preparing for a standardized test can use the AI system to review \npast topics, identify weak areas, and receive customized study plans to improve. Beyond academic growth, continuous \nlearning pathways foster a mindset of lifelong learning. In today’s rapidly changing world, where industries evolve at \nan unprecedented pace, this adaptability is crucial. LLM-powered systems prepare students not just for exams but for \nreal-world challenges, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in a dynamic global landscape. \nBy creating an environment where learning never stops, these tools ensure that students remain engaged, curious, and \nprepared for the future.\n4.2  Can LLMs contribute to the emotional and social development of students in addition to academic \nsuccess?\nThe integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education presents a transformative opportunity to enhance not \nonly academic success but also emotional, social, and cultural development. While traditional educational systems tend \nto prioritize academic performance, often overlooking students’ emotional and social needs, LLMs have the potential to \naddress these gaps by offering personalized support, promoting communication skills, and fostering mental well-being. \nThrough natural language processing (NLP) and adaptive interactions, LLMs can facilitate meaningful dialogue with \nstudents, providing them with a platform to express their thoughts and emotions. For example, AI-driven emotional \nintelligence tools can assess sentiment and generate tailored responses. A 2023 study by Chen et al. [38] found a 40% \nincrease in students’ self-reported emotional well-being when using AI-powered conversational systems in educational \ncontexts. However, while these findings are promising, it is important to note that further research is necessary to fully \nunderstand the underlying mechanisms that contribute to these improvements and to validate such claims.\nIn addition to emotional support, LLMs can foster the development of social skills by encouraging collaborative learn-\ning through virtual group discussions and role-playing scenarios. Studies have suggested that platforms incorporating \nLLMs have improved peer communication skills by up to 28% [39]. However, these claims, though notable, require more \nrigorous and longitudinal studies to confirm their robustness and long-term impact. By simulating real-world scenarios \nand promoting empathy, LLMs have the potential to encourage emotional resilience, cultural awareness, and interper -\nsonal growth. These contributions suggest that LLMs may play a key role in shaping not only academic success but also \nthe emotional and social dimensions of education. Nevertheless, the impact of LLMs on these aspects of development \nmust be further substantiated through empirical research, as their exact effects and the mechanisms involved remain \nunclear.\n4.2.1  Emotional support and well‑being\nLLMs offer significant promise in supporting students’ emotional well-being by understanding and responding to emo-\ntional cues. With increasing pressures from academic demands, social expectations, and personal challenges, students \noften face emotional difficulties such as stress, anxiety, and isolation. The integration of LLMs into educational systems \ncould offer a solution by providing consistent, empathetic, and accessible emotional support. These AI systems, using \nNLP , can simulate empathetic conversations and provide a space for students to express their emotions. While there is \nVol.:(0123456789)\nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z \n \n Review\npotential for LLMs to serve as a first line of defense for students hesitant to seek help due to stigma, further research is \nneeded to understand the specific ways in which LLMs can best support students and whether they can provide the \nsame depth of support as human counselors.\n• Personalized Emotional Support: LLMs can engage in non-judgmental conversations, allowing students to express \ntheir emotions freely without the fear of stigmatization. This is particularly beneficial for students in need of mental \nhealth support but who are hesitant to approach human counselors [40, 41]. AI-powered systems, such as LLM-based \nweb platforms, can identify distress signals in students’ language and provide tailored, calming responses. These \ninteractions are powered by vast datasets that allow LLMs to recognize and address various emotional cues, such as \nstress or frustration. However, while these interactions may be beneficial, the degree to which LLMs can effectively \naddress complex emotional issues and provide sufficient support remains a topic for further investigation.\n• Real-Time Feedback: Studies have indicated that AI-driven systems can provide real-time feedback during emotionally \ncharged situations, such as before exams or during group projects, helping students navigate conflicts or uncertain-\nties [40]. This could contribute to promoting emotional resilience, helping students stay focused on their goals while \nmanaging stress. Nevertheless, while initial findings suggest that LLMs can provide real-time interventions, more \nevidence is needed to determine the effectiveness and reliability of these interventions, especially in the long term \n[42].\nLLMs may play a complementary role to traditional counseling services by offering accessible emotional support. \nHowever, further research is necessary to fully evaluate the effectiveness and sustainability of such interventions and \ntheir role in preventing emotional burnout and promoting students’ overall well-being.\n4.2.2  Social development through AI‑facilitated interactions\nThe evolving landscape of education emphasizes collaboration and the development of social skills. Traditional educa-\ntion systems often emphasize individual achievement and competition, while LLMs offer opportunities for collaborative \nlearning through virtual discussions, group activities, and problem-solving tasks. Research has suggested that platforms \nincorporating LLMs can enhance peer communication by up to 28% [39]. However, more in-depth studies are needed \nto verify these claims and explore the specific ways LLMs contribute to social development.\nLLMs are also used in gamified learning environments that encourage teamwork, critical thinking, and shared responsi-\nbility. These platforms, including educational games like Duolingo or collaborative coding tools, foster team-based learn-\ning, promoting the development of skills like negotiation, compromise, and leadership. However, while these gamified \ntasks have been shown to enhance collaboration, the extent to which they contribute to long-term social skill develop-\nment requires further empirical analysis. Additionally, further evidence is needed to evaluate whether these skills transfer \neffectively to real-world contexts, such as workplace environments.\n4.2.3  Cross‑cultural sensitivity and communication\nIn a globalized world, the ability to communicate effectively across cultures is a vital skill. LLMs, trained on diverse data-\nsets, can help foster cross-cultural communication by providing multilingual support and culturally sensitive recommen-\ndations. In language learning platforms, LLMs not only assist with grammar and vocabulary but also expose students \nto cultural nuances, idiomatic expressions, and region-specific communication practices [ 42, 43]. This helps broaden \nstudents’ perspectives and improve their understanding of diverse worldviews.\nLLMs also help break down language barriers by offering AI-powered translation tools that enable students to com-\nmunicate and collaborate with peers from different linguistic backgrounds. By fostering empathy and understanding of \ncultural subtleties, LLMs support students in developing inclusive communication strategies [44]. However, while these \ntools can enhance cross-cultural communication, the depth of cultural understanding and the potential limitations of \nAI in addressing complex intercultural nuances need to be carefully evaluated.\nMoreover, LLMs can simulate real-world scenarios that require students to interact with individuals from different \ncultural backgrounds, providing a safe space for practicing cross-cultural communication skills. While this is a prom-\nising avenue for global learning, future advancements in LLM technology will need to ensure that they are able to \nprovide context-sensitive, culturally relevant recommendations to better prepare students for success in multicultural \nVol:.(1234567890)\nReview  \nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z\nenvironments. The evolving capabilities of LLMs in this area warrant further exploration to fully understand their impact \non students’ global communication skills.\n4.2.4  Personalized learning and emotional support\nLLMs also offer personalized learning and emotional support in ways that can adapt to both academic and emotional \nneeds. By analyzing student performance, preferences, and emotional cues, LLMs can create customized learning paths \ntailored to individual needs. For example, if a student struggles with a particular concept, an LLM-powered system \nmight offer supplementary materials, different explanations, or even shift the learning modality (from text-based to \nvideo-based) based on the student’s preferences [41]. Additionally, emotional check-ins using multimodal data (such \nas audio or video analysis) allow LLMs to detect shifts in a student’s emotions. If a student shows signs of frustration or \ndisengagement during an online session, the AI can intervene with supportive messages, suggest a break, or propose \na simpler activity to improve emotional well-being [41]. Personalized feedback, which emphasizes effort and persever -\nance, encourages a growth mindset, further supporting emotional and academic development. However, while these \nfeatures offer promising support, the overall impact of LLMs on both emotional development and academic success \nrequires further empirical validation.\n4.3  Can LLMs be trusted to develop a fair and rigorous examination environment across different academic \nlevels?\nAs societies are evolving with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), the promise of Large Language Models (LLMs) \nlike ChatGPT, Bard etc. to revolutionize examination environments has sparked a mix of optimism and caution. The \npotential for LLMs to automate grading, generate exam content, and personalize assessments offers a significant leap \nforward, but it also raises critical questions about fairness and rigor in academic evaluation. Can these systems be trusted \nto create an equitable examination environment across diverse academic levels, free from biases and inconsistencies?\nThe pursuit of fairness in AI-driven examinations is far from straightforward. While research by Mitra [45] highlights \nthe promise of multi-agent systems in generating balanced and rigorous exam content, findings from Mariyono [40] and \nRane [42] emphasize the persistent risks of algorithmic bias and hidden inequalities. Furthermore, studies such as Benitta \net al. [43] suggest that hybrid systems integrating human oversight and AI may offer a pathway to equitable grading, \nwhile Liladhar et al. [46] confirm AI’s ability to apply standardized test protocols consistently. These insights reveal a dual \nnarrative: one of transformative potential and another of unresolved challenges in ensuring transparency and fairness. \nBelow papers delves into a comparative analysis of recent studies to explore whether LLMs can be trusted to develop a \nfair and rigorous examination environment. Table 6 provides an analysis of studies examining the ability of LLMs to estab-\nlish fair and rigorous examination environments across various academic levels, highlighting key findings and unique.\nFor the future, researchers agree on the importance of proactive measures to build trust in AI-driven examination envi-\nronments. These include implementing rigorous bias audits, increasing transparency in algorithmic decision-making, and \nadopting adaptive systems that can accommodate diverse student populations. The development of ethical guidelines \nand collaboration between AI developers, educators, and policymakers will be crucial to ensuring that LLMs contribute \npositively to fair and rigorous academic evaluations.\n4.4  How can LLMs be utilized for real‑time monitoring of student progress while ensuring privacy and data \nsecurity?\nApplying Large Language Models (LLMs) in the classroom offers a revolutionary way to track the growth of learners in \nreal time. When it comes to performance analysis, providing tailored feedback, and protecting data privacy, these models \nare unmatched. But implementing them requires striking a careful balance between utilizing technology’s promise and \ntaking important privacy and ethical issues into account. In contrast to traditional methods, which typically take a generic \nstrategy, AI-powered Large Language Models (LLMs) offer dynamic, personalized learning experiences by customizing \ncontent to each student’s needs, making their integration into educational systems transformative, especially in terms \nof improving student engagement and retention.\nVol.:(0123456789)\nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z \n \n Review\nTable 6  Analysis of LLMs’ capabilities in creating fair and rigorous examination environments across academic levels\nS.

For instance, LLMs can provide tailored feedback to students, enabling real-time identification of learning \ngaps. This adaptability enhances student engagement and promotes individualized instruction [50].\nMoreover, integrating conversational agents powered by LLMs can facilitate continuous student interaction. These \nagents can track behavioral patterns, provide instant support, and even offer emotional encouragement, which is criti-\ncal for holistic progress tracking [51].\n4.4.2  Data privacy\nEnsuring privacy in educational contexts is paramount. Federated learning, an approach where LLMs train on local devices \nwithout transmitting raw data, can be instrumental. This method allows institutions to maintain data integrity while ben-\nefiting from the LLM’s learning capabilities [52]. Additionally, implementing differential privacy mechanisms can protect \nsensitive student information by adding noise to datasets, ensuring that individual data points cannot be extracted [53].\n4.4.3  Security measures\nTo secure data during LLM operation, encryption techniques such as homomorphic encryption can be employed. This \nallows data to be processed in an encrypted state, eliminating vulnerabilities during computation. Moreover, adhering to \nglobal standards like GDPR ensures compliance with robust security frameworks, safeguarding data against breaches [54].\n4.4.4  Ethical considerations\nUsing LLMs responsibly involves aligning with ethical AI practices, such as transparency and bias mitigation. It is critical \nto ensure that data usage is well-communicated to stakeholders, including students and parents, fostering trust and \nminimizing misuse [55].\n4.5  What challenges and ethical considerations have arisen from LLM’s Models usually taken to implement \nin the field of AI in Education‑today\nThe integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT into the field of education has ushered in transformative \nopportunities. These AI systems possess remarkable capabilities to tailor personalized learning experiences, automate \nhuman-like grading processes, and provide round-the-clock tutoring effectively, making education more accessible \nand scalable than ever before. With their ability to process and generate human-like text, LLMs empower educators and \nlearners alike, fostering adaptive learning paths and addressing individual needs at unprecedented scales.\nHowever, the rapid adoption of LLMs has been leftover with significant challenges and ethical dilemmas. Questions \naround bias in AI-generated content, data privacy, accountability for erroneous outputs, and the widening of the digi-\ntal critical hurdles. These issues can be seen in educational contexts, where vulnerable groups, such as children and \nstudents from underrepresented communities, are most affected. Addressing these considerations is not only vital for \nthe sustainable implementation of LLMs but also crucial for ensuring equitable and responsible use of technology in \nlearning environments. Table 7 presents the challenges in implementing Large Language Models (LLMs) in education, \nhighlighting key issues such as data privacy concerns, the need for effective integration into existing curricula, and the \npotential for bias in model outputs. These challenges underscore the importance of thoughtful, ethical implementation \nof LLMs to enhance educational outcomes while mitigating risks.\n4.5.1  Ethical considerations\n1.  Equity in education\n  One of the most critical ethical concerns surrounding the use of LLMs in education is ensuring equity in learning \nopportunities. AI-powered tools should not disproportionately benefit students who already have greater access \nto technology, while disadvantaging those from underserved or marginalized communities. Addressing the digital \ndivide is crucial for ensuring that all learners, regardless of their socioeconomic background, have equal access to \nVol.:(0123456789)\nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z \n \n Review\nTable 7  Challenges in implementing LLMs in education\nChallenge Description Recommendations\nalgorithmic bias LLMs trained on biased or unrepresentative datasets may reinforce harmful \nstereotypes and inequities in educational content. For example, models \nmay perpetuate gender or racial biases, affecting grading systems or \npersonalized learning. Studies have shown that biased training data can \nlead to outputs that disadvantage certain demographics [40, 42]\n• Implement robust bias detection and correction mechanisms\n• Ensure transparency in dataset development and AI model architecture\n• Incorporate diverse perspectives in the development process, including \nmarginalized groups, to create more equitable systems [42]\nData privacy concerns The use of student data in AI models raises significant privacy issues, par-\nticularly in light of regulations like GDPR. Concerns regarding unauthor-\nized access or misuse of sensitive data are prevalent, given the impor-\ntance of safeguarding student privacy [40, 42]\n• Utilize anonymization techniques and ensure data encryption to protect \nstudent privacy\n• Conduct regular audits and ensure AI systems comply with data protection \nregulations\n• Implement clear consent protocols to allow parents and students to under-\nstand how their data is used [42]\ninclusivity issues Limited access to technology in underserved communities exacerbates \neducational disparities, particularly for students in rural or low-income \nareas. This lack of access to modern tools, internet connectivity, or \ndevices means these students cannot fully benefit from AI-driven learn-\ning solutions [40]\n• Develop affordable, accessible AI tools for diverse socioeconomic back-\ngrounds\n• Collaborate with policymakers and NGOs to subsidize technology for \nunderserved students\n• Design AI-powered platforms with low-bandwidth capabilities and offline \nfunctionalities to accommodate limited infrastructure [40]\nDependence on technology Over-reliance on AI tools can weaken teacher-student relationships, which \nare essential for holistic emotional and social development. Excessive \ndependence on technology risks diminishing opportunities for empathy \nand interpersonal skills, which are crucial for students’ overall develop-\nment [40, 42]\n• Position AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for human \ninteraction\n• Train educators to integrate AI tools in ways that support, rather than \nreplace, meaningful teacher-student interactions\n• Focus on creating educational environments that balance digital tools with \nhuman-centered pedagogy [42]\nQuality and diversity in content LLMs might generate repetitive or low-quality responses, which can stifle \ncreativity and critical thinking. Furthermore, these models may not reflect \nthe diversity of perspectives necessary for fostering a well-rounded edu-\ncation. Some models may fail to produce nuanced content or overlook \nkey cultural, social, and historical contexts [45]\n• Implement content moderation and review systems to ensure the quality \nof AI-generated material\n• Use human oversight to ensure that AI content aligns with educational \ngoals and promotes critical thinking\n• Provide educators with clear guidelines on how to effectively use AI-gener-\nated content in their teaching [39]\nVol:.(1234567890)\nReview  \nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z\nAI-enhanced educational resources [42]. For instance, adaptive language-learning platforms that require high-speed \ninternet and modern devices may leave rural and low-income students at a disadvantage, leading to academic \ninequalities over time [40].\n• Real-World Implications:  If these challenges are not addressed, there is a risk that educational inequalities will \nworsen, further entrenching disparities in learning outcomes across different demographic groups [53].\n2.  Accountability and transparency\n  The implementation of LLMs in education requires robust transparency and accountability mechanisms. Decisions \nmade by AI models, whether for grading, content generation, or recommendations, should be clear and traceable. \nLack of transparency can erode trust among students, parents, and educators, particularly when models produce \nbiased or incorrect outputs [40, 47]. For example, an automated grading system flagged essays written by bilingual \nstudents as plagiarized due to linguistic differences, highlighting the need for careful design and review. Dwivedi \net al. [47] emphasizes the need for transparent model architecture and thorough documentation to build trust. Simi-\nlarly, Khosrawi-Rad et al. [51] underscore the value of systematic reviews and audit trails for conversational agents in \neducation.\n• Real-World Implications : A lack of accountability can result in a loss of trust in AI systems, potentially hindering \nthe widespread adoption of AI tools in educational settings [51].\n3.  Effect on originality and creativity\n  While generative AI tools can enhance learning, there is a risk that over-reliance on such technologies might stifle \nstudents’ ability to think independently and solve problems creatively [56]. Classroom experiments have shown that \nstudents who frequently rely on AI-generated content struggle with tasks requiring original thinking, compared to \nthose who develop ideas independently [6, 45, 47].\n• Real-World Implications: Without proper checks, generative AI could lead to a generation of learners with reduced \ncreative skill sets, undermining the broader purpose of education in fostering innovation [47].\n4.  Adherence to regulations\n  The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational settings must align with existing ethical guide-\nlines, privacy regulations, and pedagogical principles to ensure their responsible use. Compliance with regulations \nsuch as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is critical, as seen in the case of European schools that had \nto halt AI-based tutoring projects due to inadequate data protection protocols. Adhering to legal and ethical frame-\nworks minimizes the risk of misuse or unintended consequences, ensuring that AI innovations support educational \ngoals. According to Hooda et al. [50], AI tools used for assessment and feedback must prioritize privacy controls, \nwhile Zhang and Aslan [52] emphasize the importance of tailoring AI systems to meet regional and institutional legal \nrequirements. To mitigate risks, schools should conduct regular Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews, implement \nrobust technical controls like data encryption, and establish clear accountability measures.\n• Real-World Implications: Non-compliance can lead to legal challenges and loss of public trust, potentially stalling \nAI adoption in education [54].\n4.6  To what extent can LLMs accurately simulate real‑world teaching experiences, such as Socratic \nquestioning?\nAI-powered education systems, particularly those employing Large Language Models (LLMs), have sparked discussions \naround their computational abilities to simulate complex teaching strategies like Socratic questioning and inquiry-based \nlearning. These approaches, known for fostering critical thinking and student engagement, challenge AI systems to \nreplicate nuanced and adaptive human teaching methods effectively.\n1.  Enhanced SOCRATIC QUESTIONING with AI\n  AI systems are well-suited to mimic the structured, iterative nature of Socratic questioning. For instance, LLMs can \ncreate follow-up questions that deepen students’ understanding and encourage critical analysis. Tools like ChatGPT \nhave demonstrated the capacity to engage learners in multi-turn dialogues by generating adaptive questions based \non student inputs [55]. However, LLMs lack the ability to interpret non-verbal cues such as hesitation, frustration, or \nexcitement—key signals in live Socratic interactions, which guide a teacher’s adaptive questioning [2 ].\n2.  Facilitation of inquiry-based learning\n  AI excels at scaffolding exploratory learning, providing students with real-time guidance and resources during \nproblem-solving activities. Studies show that AI tools, when integrated into learning environments, enhance engage-\nVol.:(0123456789)\nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z \n \n Review\nment by offering data-driven, adaptive support [57]. However, these tools often fail to dynamically adjust to unpre-\ndictable student inquiries, limiting their flexibility compared to human educators [2 ].\n3.  Hybrid models: augmenting human educators\n  Research emphasizes that AI works best in hybrid models, where it supports educators by automating repetitive \ntasks and analyzing data, allowing teachers to focus on higher-level cognitive and emotional engagement [3 ]. This \ncollaboration enhances both teaching quality and student learning outcomes, particularly when applied to personal-\nized and adaptive learning frameworks [55].\n4.  Challenges and ethical considerations\n  Despite their capabilities, AI-driven workflows face challenges in replicating the cultural sensitivity, empathy, and \nethical reasoning inherent in human teaching. LLMs’ reliance on pre-trained datasets can perpetuate biases and pro-\nvide contextually inappropriate outputs [50]. Additionally, their inability to intuitively navigate complex emotional \nand cultural dynamics limits their applicability in diverse educational settings [2 ].\n5.  Efficacy in feedback and assessment\n  AI-powered tools provide immediate, precise assessments and actionable feedback, making them effective in \ninquiry-based learning contexts. For example, machine learning algorithms have been used successfully to analyze \nand improve students’ performance and self-regulation [58]. However, these systems often lack the depth of human \ninsight required for nuanced pedagogical adjustments [57].\n5  Challenges and limitations\nIntegrating large language models (LLMs) as educational agents has significant potential, but also presents distinct \nchallenges and limitations let’s discuss them:\n• Social-Emotional Development Gaps: Relying heavily on LLM-based education may diminish opportunities for stu-\ndents to develop essential social-emotional skills due to a lack of authentic human interaction, which is integral for \nempathy and emotional growth [59]. LLMs cannot fully replicate these nuanced human interactions that foster social \nbonds and emotional intelligence [10].\n• Accessibility Issues: Because not all students have equal access to the equipment, internet connections, or resources \nrequired to take advantage of these technologies, socioeconomic hurdles limit the widespread use of LLMs [60]. \nFurthermore, depending too much on AI-powered resources might result in educational inequalities, particularly in \nplaces with limited resources where digital learning infrastructure is still insufficient [61].\n• Equity Concerns: Learning tests and instructional materials may contain biases introduced by LLM agents, which \nmight exacerbate already-existing educational disparities. Because LLMs trained on biased datasets may reinforce or \nmagnify these biases, hence disadvantageous student groups, equity concerns arise [62]. Furthermore, if LLM-based \ntools are not carefully integrated, they may advantage students who are more accustomed to and comfortable with \ntechnology, which might lead to a worsening of success disparities [63].\nFigure 6 illustrates the current challenges faced in education, including issues like unequal access, outdated curricula, \nlack of personalization, and the integration of advanced technologies such as AI and LLMs. It highlights barriers impact-\ning both traditional and modern learning systems.\n6  Conclusion\nThe integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into educational systems presents a transformative opportunity to \nrevolutionize the learning experience. This systematic review of 55 studies published between 2020 and 2024 high-\nlights the significant potential of LLMs in enhancing student engagement, promoting emotional and social develop -\nment, and improving real-time monitoring of academic progress. Compared to traditional educational approaches, \nLLMs offer personalized learning pathways that cater to individual needs, allowing for greater student engagement \nand retention. While LLMs show promise in supporting academic success, their ability to contribute to emotional \nand social growth presents a compelling case for their inclusion in holistic educational practices. The use of AI-driven \nemotional intelligence tools can provide students with personalized emotional support, fostering resilience, and \nVol:.(1234567890)\nReview  \nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z\nwell-being. Furthermore, LLMs facilitate collaborative learning and cross-cultural sensitivity, which are essential skills \nin an increasingly globalized world. However, despite their advantages, the implementation of LLMs in education \nraises several critical challenges. Ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and the need for rigorous evaluation to \nensure fair and rigorous examination environments remain significant hurdles. While LLMs can help create a fairer, \nmore accessible educational system, further research is needed to ensure their responsible deployment and integra-\ntion into existing educational frameworks. Moreover, the simulation of real-world teaching experiences by LLMs, such \nas Socratic questioning, holds significant promise in enhancing interactive and dynamic learning environments. Yet, \nthe extent to which LLMs can replicate nuanced human interactions and pedagogical approaches remains an area \nfor further investigation.\nIn conclusion, while LLMs have the potential to reshape the educational landscape by offering personalized, inclu-\nsive, and accessible learning experiences, their integration must be approached thoughtfully and ethically. Future \nresearch should continue to explore the effectiveness of LLMs across diverse academic levels, ensuring that these \ntechnologies are deployed in a way that is equitable, effective, and respects the privacy and well-being of students. \nBy addressing the challenges outlined in this review, LLMs can play a pivotal role in advancing education and foster -\ning a more personalized and dynamic learning environment for all students.\nAuthor contributions All authors Sahil Sharma, Puneet Mittal, Mukesh Kumar, Vivek Bhardwaj contributed equally to the manuscript.\nFunding Open access funding provided by Manipal University Jaipur.\nData availability No datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.\nDeclarations \nEthics approval and consent to participate Not applicable.\nConsent for publication Not applicable.\nCompeting interests The authors declare no competing interests.\nFig. 6  Current challenges in \neducation\n\nVol.:(0123456789)\nDiscover Sustainability           (2025) 6:243  | https://doi.org/10.1007/s43621-025-01094-z \n \n Review\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License, which \npermits any non-commercial use, sharing, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit \nto the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if you modified the licensed material. \nYou do not have permission under this licence to share adapted material derived from this article or parts of it.
