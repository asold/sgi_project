    "abstract": "Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of transformer oil is considered to be the utmost reliable condition monitoring technique currently used to detect incipient faults within power transformers. While the measurement accuracy has become relatively high since the development of various off-line and on-line measuring sensors, interpretation techniques of DGA results still depend on the level of personnel expertise more than analytical formulation. Therefore, various interpretation techniques may lead to different conclusions for the same oil sample. Moreover, ratio-based interpretation techniques may fail in interpreting DGA data in case of multiple fault conditions and when the oil sample comprises insignificant amount of the gases used in the specified ratios. This paper introduces an improved approach to overcome the limitations of conventional DGA interpretation techniques, automate and standardize the DGA interpretation process. The approach is built based on incorporating all conventional DGA interpretation techniques in one expert system to identify the fault type in a more consistent and reliable way. Gene Expression Programming is employed to establish this expert system. Results show that the proposed approach provides more reliable results than using individual conventional methods that are currently adopted by industry practice worldwide.",
