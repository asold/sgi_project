    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-4, introduces transformative opportunities for higher education across various disciplines. While the integration of LLMs into higher education has sparked significant debate regarding whether to fully incorporate these systems into curricula or restrict their use, this paper contends that there has been an inadequate focus on the process of establishing suitable guidelines for their usage. Given the importance of stakeholder buy in, especially in terms of perceiving the final decision as legitimate, this paper advocates for transparent and inclusive procedures that involve faculty, administration, and students during the integration process. Once a decision is made, clear justifications for LLM guidelines should be provided, paired with an effective implementation strategy, to ensure widespread acceptance and adherence.",
