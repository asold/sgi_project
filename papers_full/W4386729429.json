Offering personalized recommendations to users is crucial for helping them discover content that aligns with\ntheir preferences. Content metadata, including genre, director, cast, plot synopsis, and box office summary, provides\nvaluable complementary information about different aspects of a title, greatly contributing to the personalization\nprocess. In this talk, our focus lies on genre labels, which represent broad categories such as \"horror, \" \"comedy, \" or\n\"romance, \" and have demonstrated significant effectiveness in tailoring the user experience [1, 4].\nChallenges: Extracting valuable signals directly from genre labels presents several challenges. Firstly, the absence\nof a universally accepted definition of genre and the lack of consensus on genre categorizations from various different\nsources pose significant obstacles. While genres like romance, comedy, thriller, action, drama, and horror are widely\nrecognized and prevalent, there are lesser-known genres such as sports, documentary, western, music, etc., some of\nwhich may not be universally acknowledged as genres. Consequently, genre labels can be noisy, inconsistent, and\nsubjected to the personal judgments of annotators. Secondly, the coverage of less-common genres in movies tends to be\nlimited, reducing the availability of data for these genres. This scarcity poses challenges for accurately capturing and\nrepresenting the characteristics of these genres. Thirdly, certain genres, like \"rom-com, \" are more of a combination of\nother genres. These blended genres further complicate the categorization process and introduce ambiguity. Fourthly,\nmovies often belong to multiple genres, and in many cases, the assignment of genres can be subjective.

Furthermore, genre labels\ndo not capture the degree or intensity of a genre within a video. For instance, a movie like Jurassic Park can be classified\nas a science fiction and adventure film, but it also contains elements of horror and thriller. The genre labels alone\nfail to convey the nuanced blend of genres present in the movie. Moreover, movies within the same genre can still\nexhibit substantial differences. For example, consider two movies namely ‘Gladiator‘ and ‘Die Hard‘, both categorized\nas action films. However, the flavor of action in these movies diverges significantly due to distinct contextual factors.\nGladiator is an epic historical action film set in ancient Rome, showcasing thrilling battles and action sequences within\nthe Colosseum. On the other hand, Die Hard centers around intense action scenes taking place in a modern skyscraper\nduring a terrorist siege.\n2 GENRE SPECTRUM\nWe propose an alternative approach to examining the genres which we refer to as the Genre Spectrum . Our hypothesis\nis that every title consists of a spectrum of genres and we transform the discrete genre labels data into a latent space\nwhere each dimension could be considered as an abstract concept/characteristic of a movie. Every genre will then\nmanifest itself in this latent space as a subspace defined by a range of combinations of all the latent dimensions. We\nhypothesize that the continuum nature of genre spectrum embeddings enhances its expressive power in comparison to\nthe discrete genre labels.\nFig. 1. Neural net architecture for learning Genre Spectrum Embeddings\n2.1 Methodology\nWe use neural network based supervised machine learning to learn genre-spectrum embeddings. The underlying\nintuition is that the textual metadata of movies (e.g. genre, language, year of release, plot synopsis and summary, ratings,\nRotten Tomatoes scores, user reviews, box office information etc.) have rich information to classify a movie into one or\nmore genre labels. We collect textual metadata of about 1.1M movies from various sources and apply language modeling\ntechniques to learn textual embedding of every movie in a text-embedding space. We then formulate a multi-label\nclassification problem that aims to predict the genre labels using learned textual embeddings as input features. In\nparticular, we train a multi-layer feedforward dense neural network that ingests textual embeddings as inputs and\nemits the probabilities of every genre class as the output. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss averaged over\nall the genre classes. Both the components of the neural net, the textual-to-genre-spectrum transformer and the genre\nclassifier are trained jointly on the multi-label cross-entropy loss function. Thus, once the model is trained, we simply\nobtain genre-spectrum embeddings, by doing a forward pass on the transformer component of the neural net, i.e. collect\nthe output from the penultimate layer of the neural net (as shown in Figure 1).\n2\nBeyond Labels: Leveraging Deep Learning and LLMs for Content Metadata RecSys ’23, September 18–22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\nFig. 2. A 2-D plot of genre spectrum embeddings generated using Universal Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique\nData Augmentation:To further improve the quality of embeddings particularly on less-popular movies that have\npoor quality of metadata, we applied data augmentation technique proposed in [6] on the training data. This technique\nrandomly samples two training samples and take their random convex combination (on both features and labels) to\ngenerate a new synthetic data sample. We applied this technique (with small modifications to increase representation\nof rarer classes) and increased the training data by a factor of 10.\n3 EXPERIMENTS & RESULTS\n3.1 Data and Setup\nWe collected textual metadata and genre labels of about 1.1M movies and tv series from three sources of movie metadata,\nnamely: IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Gracenote. We used 60-20-20 split to generate training, validation, and test set.\nTable 1.

As can be seen, the genres appear to be cohesive colored clusters in\n3\nRecSys ’23, September 18–22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore Agrawal, et al.\nthe latent space. Next, we evaluate different variants of Genre Spectrum (GS) embeddings based on the genre similarity\nin the neighborhood of every movie. Specifically, for each movie, we compute genre similarity in top-𝑘 neighborhood\nas a fraction of top 𝑘 nearest neighbors in genre-spectrum space that share one or more primary genres with the given\nmovie. A primary genre is defined as the one that is assigned to a movie by majority of the labeling sources. To gain\ndeeper insights into the relationship between the metric and popularity, the genre similarity score is calculated as an\naverage across different subsets of movies, which are grouped based on their IMDB votes as shown in Table 1. The\nfirst six rows in the table correspond to six variants of embeddings, three of them are textual embeddings generated\nusing a variety of NLP models including Doc2Vec (96 dimensions)[2], pretrained BERT model trained on web corpus\n[5] (768 dimensions), and OpenAI GPT-4 (1536 dimensions) [ 3] the latest version of LLM released by OpenAI. The\nnext three rows correspond to Genre Spectrum embeddings learnt using genre label supervision on each one of the\naforementioned textual embeddings. The last row corresponds to another variant of GS on Doc2Vec where we applied\ndata augmentation step described in Section 2.1. We make several insightful observations from the table: i) All the\nvariants of Genre Spectrum embeddings perform better than their corresponding textual embedding variants in all\nthe popularity buckets, validating the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethodology also applies in the context of LLMs. ii) Further, it can be seen that the improvement in genre-similarity is\nhigher on the lower popularity buckets. This could potentially be attributed to the fact that the quality of metadata\n(e.g. terse synopses, less tags) degrades on non-popular movies. Consequently, the textual embeddings tend to be\nmore unreliable in classifying genres for such movies. However, the noise is considerably reduced in Genre Spectrum\nembeddings as they are trained using genre labels. iii) GS-Augmented on Doc2Vec beats GS on Doc2Vec consistently\nin genre similarity scores for all the popularity segments, justifying the utility of data augmentation step. Further in\nFigure 3, we present an anecdotal example of a popular movie called Life of Pi ‘ to compare top-10 neighbors in textual\nand genre spectrum embedding spaces. In comparison to textual embedding space, neighbors in genre-spectrum latent\nspace are much better aligned with the query movie on genre similarity.\n3.3 Online evaluation\nTo evaluate genre-spectrum embeddings in our online Tubi recommender system, we introduced a retrieval model in\nour production system. This model retrieves nearest neighbors of movies the user previously watched. Through an\nA/B test, we compared it to the control variant, which utilized binary genre labels. The test resulted in a statistically\nsignificant 0.6 % improvement in our primary user-engagement metric, ’tvt-capped’ (total view time capped at 4 hours\nper day). This improvement validates the effectiveness of genre spectrum embeddings in enhancing personalization\nand user engagement.\n4 CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK\nWe presented a case study on various challenges in incorporating genre label information in movie recommendation\nsystems and how to address those challenges by learning meaningful embeddings to capture genre label information in\na video-recommendation problem setting. An evident expansion of our work involves broadening the scope of content\nmetadata to encompass other manually annotated movie datasets that offer a more extensive range of tags. Nevertheless,\na common hurdle with such datasets lies in their limited coverage. Given the powerful capabilities of LLMs, one of the\npotential future directions could be to apply LLMs on textual metadata and generate more specific annotations for every\nmovie in the form of micro-genres. Such micro-genres could then be used along with genre labels to learn more precise\nrepresentation vectors of movies. Additionally, micro-genres could also be very useful in optimal organization of movie\n4\nBeyond Labels: Leveraging Deep Learning and LLMs for Content Metadata RecSys ’23, September 18–22, 2023, Singapore, Singapore\nFig. 3.

In particular, movie recommendations on prominent Video on Demand (VOD)\nplatforms such as Tubi, Netflix, and Amazon Prime are typically presented in a 2-D grid layout using a set of ’carousels. ’\nEach carousel groups together movies with a common theme, such as genre, language, or year, as reflected in its title.\nConventional methods often use limited themes (e.g., standard genres or 90’s classics) for carousel generation, which\nmight result in sub-optimal personalization of the home-grid. By incorporating LLM-generated micro-genres, we can\nenrich the pool of carousel themes, leading to more effective personalization. During the presentation, we will also\nshare preliminary results from our explorations in this direction.\n5 BIOGRAPHIES\nSaurabh Agrawalis a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Tubi since August 2022 where he leads deep learning\nprojects for Search and Recommendation Systems at Tubi.
