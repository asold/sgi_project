Current UK guidelines recom-\nmend that adults complete at least 150 minutes of mod-\nerate intensity activity, such as brisk walking, every week\n[2]. Nevertheless, the English National Travel Survey\n2010 reports that walking trips have declined by 28%\nsince 1995 [3].\nEcological models of health behaviour suggest that\nenvironments such as residential neighbourhoods can\ndirectly influence physical activity behaviours including\nwalking [4]. However, the objective measurement of\nenvironmental variables provides a substantial research\nchallenge. Mapping technologies, such as Geographical\nInformation Systems (GIS), have increased access to ob-\njectively characterised data on neighbourhood design\nand land-use. These data are now regularly utilised in\nphysical activity research and significant associations\nhave been found between walking behaviours and land-\nuse mix, population density and destination proximity\n[5]. Detailed street-level characteristics such as pavement\nquality, lighting and aesthetics may additionally be influ-\nential. Indeed, walking for both travel and leisure have\nbeen significantly associated with individuals ’ percep-\ntions of the availability of pavements [6,7] and aesthetics\n[8]. Objectively measured street-level data, however, are\nrarely available through mapping databases [9].* Correspondence:m.hillsdon@exeter.ac.uk\n1Sport and Health Sciences, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2013 Griew et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity2013, 10:103\nhttp://www.ijbnpa.org/content/10/1/103\nA number of street audit tools such as the Systematic\nPedestrian And Cycling Environment Scan tool\nSPACES [10], the Pedestrian Environment Review Sys-\ntem (www.trl.co.uk) and the Residential Environment\nAssessment Tool REAT [11] are available to measure\nthe street characteristics hypothesised to influence\nwalking behaviours. Such audit tools are completed in-\nperson by trained researchers and are typically found\nto provide a valid and reliable measure [10,11]. How-\never, in-person audits are highly time-consuming, have\nsafety issues for personnel and are costly due to the re-\nlated travel expenditure, thus prohibiting large-scale\ndata collection for the majo rity of research projects.\nRecent technological advancements, such as the Goo-\ngle Street View programme ( www.google.com/maps),\nmight provide an alternative mechanism to traditional\nin-person street auditing. Google Street View is a freely\navailable web service using video stills of streets and\nneighbourhoods captured worldwide. The images are\ndisplayed to provide continuous panoramic street\nviews that can be navigated along and rotated by 360°\nallowing the user to virtually walk down any available\nstreet from their computer. The use of this desk-based\ntool, therefore, has the potential to dramatically reduce\nthe resources necessary to complete large-scale assess-\nment of street characteristics.\nThe reliability of desk-based auditing has previously\nbeen investigated by a small number of studies all of\nwhich consistently report high levels of agreement be-\ntween Google Street View and in-person measures\n[12-14]. Nevertheless, to date, the majority of this re-\nsearch has focused on somewhat homogenous urban\nareas within the US. Further research is therefore neces-\nsary to assess the appropriateness of Google Street View\nin differing countries and area types where factors such\nas varying road and pavement width or traffic and build-\ning density could potentially impact upon the reliability\nof the measurement tool.\nThis study aims to first, test the inter-rater and intra-\nrater reliability of a newly developed street audit tool\ndesigned specifically for u se with Google Street View\nand, second, to test the reliability of this desk-based\nmeasure when compared wit h on-foot street audits\nacross a range of land-use types within the UK. This\nresearch forms part of the FAST study (Forty Area\nSTudy). FAST is examining the degree to which built\nenvironment characteristics influence adult ’s physical\nactivity behaviours across a broad range of social and\nenvironmental settings in northwest England. In FAST,\nwe are particularly interested in capturing aspects of\nthe street environment around our participants’ homes\nthat may influence their walking and cycling behav-\niours, and the street audit tool that we present in this\np a p e r ,w a sd e v e l o p e df o rt h i sp u r p o s e .\nMethods\nStreet audit tool development\nThe FASTVIEW audit tool was created in collaboration\nwith the UK Transport Research Laboratory (TRL). The\naudit tool was based on the Pedestrian Environment Re-\nview System (PERS) initially designed by TRL to identify\ntarget areas for improving pedestrian access within\nLondon and the rest of the UK (www.trl.co.uk). PERS\nand FASTVIEW have different aims and therefore modi-\nfications to the original PERS were made to reduce the\nsubjective elements of the tool and to take into account\ncurrent academic evidence and the expert opinion of the\nFAST steering committee. For example, an assessment\nof the housing design and‘feel’ of a street was replaced\nwith an assessment of housing and street maintenance\nwhere auditors were asked to assess factors such as\nlevels of graffiti and litter. The final FASTVIEW tool in-\ncorporated nine categories of neighbourhood character-\nistics (e.g. pavement quality, lighting and safety) with\neach category including up to three separate factors (e.g.\npavement width and spacing of street lights) as displayed\nin Table 1. Each factor had a number of levels that it\nwas rated on. In Table 1 the levels are listed in the third\ncolumn and are ordered from more positive through to\nmore negative (researchers wanting access to the tool\nshould contact the corresponding author).\nA data input form was created using Microsoft Access\nwith drop down menu options for all responses. The\nform was designed to be viewed alongside Google Street\nView using a computer split screen (Figure 1). Prior to\ndata collection all auditors completed a one-day training\ncourse with an experienced auditor from TRL and were\nprovided with a detailed user manual for reference dur-\ning auditing. For each link both sides of the road were\naudited. When a road had a pavement on one side only\nthe side with the pavement was audited. For pavement\nwidth and street lighting spacing the distance measure-\nment tool in Google Street View was used. A guideline\nof 10– 15 minutes completion time was suggested for\neach street audit. Both Google Street View and on-street\naudits took approximately 10 minutes to complete.\nSampling\nWigan, a large UK town in the North West of England\nwas chosen to test the reliability of the FASTVIEW audit\ntool due to the large diversity of land-use types (includ-\ning housing, shopping, parkland and industrial areas)\nclose to the town centre. The population weighted cen-\ntroid for the town was located using a Geographical In-\nformation System (GIS) and the audit area was defined\nby an 800 m radius (approximately a 10 minute walk)\naround this centre point (Figure 2). The road network\nwithin the study area was mapped in the GIS and di-\nvided into road sections termed ‘links’. Where possible\nGriew et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity2013, 10:103 Page 2 of 7\nhttp://www.ijbnpa.org/content/10/1/103\nthese links stretched between road junctions, however in\nthe case of long roads that had few junctions we aimed\nto maintain homogeneity within links by setting the\nmaximum link length at 300 metres thus minimising the\npotential for links to straddle different land uses. Conse-\nquently long stretches of road were split into a series of\nlinks no longer than 300 metres in length. Similarly the\nminimum link length was set at 50 metres. A total of\n216 eligible audit links were identified within the study\narea, of these 25% (n = 54) were randomly selected for\nauditing based on recommendations [15]. The 54 links\nequated to 5.36 kilometres of road network.\nData reduction and analysis\nEach street link was rated as‘good’ (2), ‘fair’ (1) or ‘poor’\n(0) in each of the nine walkability categories based on\ncombined results from the associated factors. For ex-\nample a street with wide pavements (>3 m), street furni-\nture (e.g. benches and lighting) aligned to the side of the\npavement, and with no cars parking on the pavement\nwould get the highest score (2) in the pavement width\nand obstructions category (see Table 1). In general, if the\nlevels of each category were consistently positive then\nthe category would be rated as good and if they were\nconsistently negative the category would be rated as\npoor. If the levels were neither consistently good nor\npoor then the category was rated as fair.\nThe kappa statistic was chosen for the reliability ana-\nlysis as it provides a chance-corrected measure of agree-\nment suitable for use with categorical data. However,\na recognised limitation of the kappa statistic is that a\nlow kappa co-efficient can be recorded despite high\nTable 1 Walkability categories within the audit tool\nCategory Factors Levels\nPavement width and\nobstructions\nPavement width (metres) >3; 2 –3; 1–2; <1; no pavement\nStreet furniture placement Aligned to side; poorly placed; N/A*\nPresence of cars parked on the pavement No cars on pavement; cars on pavement; N/A\nPavement surface quality Pavement trip hazards No obvious trip hazards; some trip hazards; N/A\nPavement surface consistency Consistent; inconsistent; N/A\nReinstatements in pavement surface Not obvious; obvious; N/A\nKerb paving quality Presence of tactile paving at kerbs All crossings; >50% of crossings; 50% of crossings; <50% of crossings; no\ntactile paving; N/A\nPresence of dropped kerbs All crossings; >50% of crossings; 50% of crossings; <50% of crossings; no\ndropped kerbs; N/A\nRoad permeability Road width (metres) Pedestrianised street; shared surface street; <6; 6 –10; >10\nObstructions to crossing No guardrails or parked cars; <50%; 50%; >50%\nAvailability of designated crossing points Quiet residential street; 2+ crossings; 1 crossing; no crossings; N/A\nWay finding and legibility Presence of street name signage All street names present; >50%; 50%; <50%; none\nPresence of other pedestrian signage Additional signage; no additional signage\nPresence of landmarks Landmarks; no landmarks\nLighting Presence of street lighting Focussed on pavement; focussed on carriageway; no lighting\nSpacing of street lighting (metres) 20-30; 30 –50; >50; N/A\nLikelihood of overnight lighting from\nnearby buildings\nShop fronts likely to provide light; not likely\nPersonal security Evidence of vandalism or graffiti No evidence; some evidence\nPresence of closed circuit television\nsurveillance\nYes; No\nInformal surveillance from nearby housing Yes; No\nUser conflict Obstruction from bus queues Yes; No\nSeparation between cyclists and\npedestrians\nYes; No\nPresence of traffic calming measures Yes; No\nEnvironment quality Quality of housing High quality frontages; low quality frontages\nPresence of trees Yes; No\nStreet maintenance Clean and well maintained; some litter; some litter and graffiti\n* N/A, Not Applicable because there was no pavement.\nGriew et al.

Thus results here report and\ndiscuss the percentage of observed agreement in\nconjunction with the calculated kappa co-efficient.\nKappa values were interpreted as follows: 0.01-0.20\n(slight agreement); 0.21-0.40 (fair agreement); 0.41-\n0.60 (moderate agreement); 0.61-0.80 (substantial\nagreement); 0.81-0.99 (almost perfect agreement) [16].\nThree reliability tests were conducted: inter-rater,\nintra-rater and criterion reliability.\nIntra-rater reliability\nTo assess the level of agreement over repeated measures\neach auditor (n = 3) completed desk-based street audits\nusing Google Street View for 20 randomly selected links\non two separate occasions. Intra-rater reliability was\nassessed using Cohens’ kappa statistic.\nInter-rater reliability\nTo assess the level of agreement between researchers all\nthree auditors completed desk based street audits using\nGoogle Street View for all of the area links (n = 54). Inter-\nrater reliability was assessed using Fleiss’ kappa statistic.\nCriterion reliability\nTo assess agreement between desk-based audits using\nGoogle Street View and in-person street audits, re-\nsearchers carried out in-person audits for selectively\nsampled links (n = 30) encompassing a mix of land-use\ntypes. The auditing for the reliability study was part of\na wider auditing study, with auditors auditing street\nlinks using both street view and on-foot visits. The on-\nfoot audits could take place either before or after street\nview but were always within 6 months of each other.\nAuditors could not review their scores for one version\nof the audit prior to undertaking the other. Given the\nFigure 1FASTVIEW audit tool.\nGriew et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity2013, 10:103 Page 4 of 7\nhttp://www.ijbnpa.org/content/10/1/103\nlarge number of links, it is extremely unlikely that\nthese scores would be recalled. Criterion reliability was\nassessed using Cohens’ kappa statistic.\nAll reliability tests were run using STATA version 12.\nResults\nReliability test results are displayed in Table 2. The\nFASTVIEW tool was found to provide fair to moderate\ninter and intra-rater reliability over the majority of street\ncharacteristic categories and substantial agreement was\nreported between desk-based audits using Google Street\nView and those conducted in-person.\nIntra-rater reliability results were high for all street\ncharacteristics, with an average of 81% (k = 0.4) agree-\nment between the first and second audit. The‘fair’ kappa\nco-efficient can largely be explained by results from the\nuser conflict category where a result of k =−0.05 was\nreturned despite 90% agreement between measures.\nInter-rater reliability results were high (average 71.7%)\nfor the majority of street characteristics, however, in\nthree categories (pavement quality, lighting, and road\npermeability) reliability results were low for both per-\ncentage agreement (<60%) and the kappa co-efficient\n(<0.4). Additional detailed analysis revealed that inter-\nrater reliability varied substantially between land-use\ntypes with the lowest average agreement between audi-\ntors (60%) recorded in industrial estates and the highest\naverage agreement (74%) attained in residential areas.\nPercent agreement between in-person and desk-based\naudits (criterion reliability) was high across all street\ncharacteristic categories with results ranging from 75 to\n97% agreement (average 84%) and the kappa co-efficient\nranging from k = 0.5 to 0.9 (moderate to almost perfect).\nDiscussion\nThe FASTVIEW tool was found to provide a reliable\nmeasure of street characteristics considered likely to be\nassociated with individual walking behaviours. It was\nfound to provide a reliable measure of street characteris-\ntics reporting high percentage agreement and moderate\nkappa coefficients for levels of inter and intra-rater reli-\nability over the majority of street characteristic categor-\nies. Furthermore the use of Google Street View to\ncomplete street audits provided high levels of agreement\nbetween the desk-based and on-site audits.\nThis new measure is therefore considered to provide a\npractical and reliable street audit tool. Nevertheless, for\nthree of the nine street characteristic categories, agree-\nment levels were found to be low between auditors. Pre-\nvious environment audit tools have often noted low\nlevels of inter-rater reliability where variables require a\njudgement on quality or aesthetics [10,17]. Similarly the\nlowest inter-rater agreement here was reported for the\npavement quality category. Furthermore, when assessed\nin greater detail, inter-rater reliability was found to vary\nsubstantially between land-use types, with the lowest\nagreement found within industrial estates. Raters had\nFigure 2Street network 800 m buffer zone.\nTable 2 Reliability scores\nCategory\nInter-rater reliability Intra-rater reliability Criterion reliability\n% Agreement K % Agreement K % Agreement K\nPavement width and obstructions 88.5 0.597 83.3 0.44 85.0 0.69\nPavement surface quality 51.3 −0.009 70.0 0.48 83.3 0.73\nKerb paving quality 82.7 0.373 86.7 0.45 75.0 0.55\nRoad permeability 58.3 0.143 73.3 0.48 86.7 0.73\nWay finding and legibility 71.8 0.313 86.7 0.66 76.7 0.50\nLighting 57.7 −0.075 86.7 0.60 78.3 0.61\nPersonal security 79.5 0.445 86.7 0.42 88.3 0.64\nUser conflict 89.1 0.451 90.0 −0.05 96.7 0.90\nEnvironment quality 66.7 0.232 66.7 0.30 86.7 0.62\nGriew et al.

Further refinement of the\ntraining procedure and guidance manual, in particular\nfocusing on a range of different land-use areas, may be\nbeneficial to ensure high agreement between auditors\nacross all categories.\nFindings from this study indicate that desk-based au-\ndits using Google Street View provide an effective and\nreliable alternative to in-person street audits within the\nUK, with similarly high levels of reliability as those\nrecorded in urban areas of the US [13,14]. This conclu-\nsion is important as desk-based auditing can provide\nmany substantial benefits. Most notably the time and\ncosts of objective street auditing are substantially dimin-\nished. Indeed trained auditors can now complete large-\nscale street characteristic research from a single location.\nObjective analysis is therefore achievable for the major-\nity of research projects, vastly improving the potential\nfor analysis across diverse areas within countries and\ninternationally. Additional benefits of this method in-\nclude supportive technology such as the distance meas-\nurement tool available in Google Street View enabling\naccurate assessment of variables such as pavement width\nand street light spacing, which can be difficult to capture\nin-person, and the removal of any potential lone auditor\nsafety concerns.\nStrengths and limitations\nDuring the auditing process a number of limitations in\nthe use of Google Street View were identified. First, the\nview from the Google Street View cameras differs to that\nof a pedestrian auditor, pictures are provided from the\ncentre of the road rather than the pavement, thus, block-\nages such as parked cars or road works can obstruct\nviews of specific variables on some streets, in particular,\npavement quality and signage. Furthermore, image\nclarity varied dependent upon the weather conditions\nand lighting when images were taken, and the vehicles\nused to collect images may not be able to access\npedestrianized streets, a particular problem for many\ncity centre audits across the UK. Second, the temporality\nof Street View can be problematic. For example, results\nin some categories (e.g. the number of parked cars) may\nvary throughout the day, but the time when images were\ntaken is not provided by the system. Similarly, although\nstreet auditing may be undertaken in conjunction with\nphysical activity assessment, a substantial time lapse may\nhave occurred since pictures were obtained for Street\nView images, thus the possibility that changes in street\nconditions may have occurred between measures cannot\nbe ruled-out. Nevertheless the ease, speed, low associ-\nated costs and high criterion reliability of desk-based\nauditing are argued to considerably out-weigh these\nlimitations.\nThis study provides comprehensive reliability testing\nof a new audit tool designed specifically for desk-based\nauditing and the suitability of the measure was tested.\nOne large UK town was chosen for auditing purposes\nand, following previous recommendations [15], 25% of\nall possible street links were included in the measure for\nboth inter-rater and intra-rater reliability tests. Previous\nresearch assessing the reliability of Google Street View\nto measure street characteristics has largely focused on\nurban environments in the US [13,14], this study there-\nfore adds to current research providing results specific\nto the UK and across a range of land-use types. How-\never, a limitation of the study is that, due to resource re-\nstrictions, just 30 street links were audited in-person\nproviding a relatively small sample for criterion reliabil-\nity analysis. In addition this study did not assess the\nreliability of the FASTVIEW tool within rural areas of\nthe country.\nThis research was conducted as part of the wider\nFAST study measuring environmental associations with\nadult’s physical activity. Further analysis is necessary to\nassess associations between street characteristics, mea-\nsured using the FASTVIEW audit tool, and self-reported\nwalking behaviours and objectively measured physical\nactivity. Further, the value of street audit measures for\ndiscriminating walking behaviours over macro level\nneighbourhood measures, derived from GIS, requires\nadditional analysis.\nConclusion\nThe FASTVIEW audit tool provides a reliable, easy to\nuse, and appropriate tool for the objective measurement\nof street characteristics over a range of differing land-use\ntypes and is, therefore, recommended for future large-\nscale street auditing.\nAbbreviations\nFAST: Forty Area STudy; GIS: Geographical Information System;\nPERS: Pedestrian Environment Review System.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nPG drafted the initial manuscript, PG, MH & CF completed data collection\nand statistical analysis, EC and AJ completed the GIS mapping.
