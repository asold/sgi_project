  "abstract": "To accurately detect and monitor the internal temperature of an operating power transformer, the distributed optical fiber sensor (DOFS) was creatively applied inside an oil-immersed 35 kV transformer through high integration with the winding wire. On the former basis, the power transformer prototype with a completely global internal temperature sensing capability was successfully developed and it was also qualified for power grid operation through the ex-factory type tests. The internal spatially continuous temperature distribution of the operating transformer was then revealed through a heat-run test and the numerical simulation was also applied for further analysis. Hotspots of windings were continuously located and monitored (emerging at about 89%/90% height of low/high voltage winding), which were furtherly compared with the IEC calculation results. This new nondestructive internal sensing method shows a broad application prospect in the electrical equipment field. Also, the revelation of transformer internal distributed temperature can offer a solid reference for both researchers and field operation staff.",
