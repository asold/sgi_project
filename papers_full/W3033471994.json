  "abstract": "There is a mounting need for low-cost monitoring with online sensing technologies to maintain grid reliability and uptime. Here we introduce an innovative low-cost, embedded optical sensing technology initially focused on transformers that was developed and demonstrated at a major electric utility, Con Edison. A version of it that can be retrofitted onto existing transformers in the field was also developed. Two new 500 kVA distribution network transformers were built with embedded fiber-optic (FO) sensors and qualified per industry standards. Vibration, temperature, and corrosion were key parameters monitored. The first transformer with embedded FO sensors was installed at a Con Edison facility and monitored at our team’s office. The second one was installed in an urban street-side underground location with online data processing/feature extraction algorithms and monitored through a wireless router. Additionally, an older transformer was also retrofitted. Data analysis was done on these transformers showing promising correlations with their corresponding loading cycles. Furthermore, key events such as the transformer primary-side energizing, and other events were detected. In general, the technology was demonstrated over 6 months across the 3 transformers instrumented with promising results. Thus, it has the potential to enable predictive maintenance for transformers and other grid assets.",
