    "abstract": "The detection of On-Load Tap-Changer (OLTC) faults at an early stage plays a significant role in the maintenance of power transformers, which is the most strategic component of the power network substations. Among the OLTC fault detection methods, vibro-acoustic signal analysis is known as a performant approach with the ability to detect many faults of different types. Extracting the characteristic features from the measured vibro-acoustic signal envelopes is a promising approach to precisely diagnose OLTC faults. The present research work is focused on developing a methodology to detect, locate, and track changes in on-line monitored vibro-acoustic signal envelopes based on the main peaks extraction and Euclidean distance analysis. OLTC monitoring systems have been installed on power transformers in services which allowed the recording of a rich dataset of vibro-acoustic signal envelopes in real time. The proposed approach was applied on six different datasets and a detailed analysis is reported. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in recognizing, following, and localizing the faults that cause changes in the vibro-acoustic signal envelopes over time.",
