  "full_text": "SOFTWARE Open Access\nPan-genome sequence analysis using Panseq:\nan online tool for the rapid analysis of core and\naccessory genomic regions\nChad Laing1, Cody Buchanan1, Eduardo N Taboada1, Yongxiang Zhang1, Andrew Kropinski2, Andre Villegas2,\nJames E Thomas3, Victor PJ Gannon1*\nAbstract\nBackground: The pan-genome of a bacterial species consists of a core and an accessory gene pool. The accessory\ngenome is thought to be an important source of genetic variability in bacterial populations and is gained through\nlateral gene transfer, allowing subpopulations of bacteria to better adapt to specific niches. Low-cost and high-\nthroughput sequencing platforms have created an exponential increase in genome sequence data and an\nopportunity to study the pan-genomes of many bacterial species. In this study, we describe a new online pan-\ngenome sequence analysis program, Panseq.\nResults: Panseq was used to identifyEscherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli K-12 genomic islands. Within a population\nof 60 E. coli O157:H7 strains, the existence of 65 accessory genomic regions identified by Panseq analysis was\nconfirmed by PCR. The accessory genome and binary presence/absence data, and core genome and single\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of sixL. monocytogenes strains were extracted with Panseq and hierarchically\nclustered and visualized. The nucleotide core and binary accessory data were also used to construct maximum\nparsimony (MP) trees, which were compared to the MP tree generated by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). The\ntopology of the accessory and core trees was identical but differed from the tree produced using seven MLST loci.\nThe Loci Selector module found the most variable and discriminatory combinations of four loci within a 100 loci\nset among 10 strains in 1 s, compared to the 449 s required to exhaustively search for all possible combinations; it\nalso found the most discriminatory 20 loci from a 96 lociE. coli O157:H7 SNP dataset.\nConclusion: Panseq determines the core and accessory regions among a collection of genomic sequences based\non user-defined parameters. It readily extracts regions unique to a genome or group of genomes, identifies SNPs\nwithin shared core genomic regions, constructs files for use in phylogeny programs based on both the presence/\nabsence of accessory regions and SNPs within core regions and produces a graphical overview of the output.\nPanseq also includes a loci selector that calculates the most variable and discriminatory loci among sets of\naccessory loci or core gene SNPs.\nAvailability: Panseq is freely available online at http://76.70.11.198/panseq. Panseq is written in Perl.\nBackground\nThe field of genomics has blossomed as a result of the\nfast rate of whole-genome sequence data acquisition.\nT h ep a c eo fg e n o m ed a t ag r o w t hc o n t i n u e st oi n c r e a s e\na st h ec o s tt oa c q u i r et h ed a t ac o n t i n u e st od e c r e a s e .\nThis has been led in large part by massively parallel\nsequencing platforms such as the 454 Genome Sequen-\ncer FLX (Roche Applied Science), the Illumina (Solexa)\nGenome Analyzer and the ABI SOLiD System (Applied\nBiosystems), which generate tens of millions of base\npairs of information in short reads 30 to several hun-\ndred base pairs in length [1,2]. These reads must be\ncombined into large contiguous DNA sequences by\ndedicated software such as Newbler (Roche) and MAQ\n* Correspondence: vic.gannon@phac-aspc.gc.ca\n1Laboratory for Foodborne Zoonoses, Public Health Agency of Canada,\nLethbridge, AB, Canada\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nLaing et al.

Although these“ contigs” can stretch into the mega-\nbase-pair (Mb) range, the sequencing of an entire organ-\ni s mb ya n yo n eo ft h e s et e c hniques invariably leaves\ngaps in the reassembled sequence [3]. The finishing of a\nsequence requires gap-closure by sequencing of PCR\nproducts and the resolution of sequencing errors.\nSequencing efforts are primarily driven by the discovery\nof novel genes and, as gap closure is time-consuming\nand expensive, many researchers now use un-finished\ndraft sequences of genomes in their analyses [4].\nTettelin et al. [5] used the term“ pan-genome” to refer to\nthe full complement of genes within a bacterial species.\nComprising the pan-genome are the core complement of\ngenes common to all members of a species and a dispen-\nsable or accessory genome that is present in at least one\nbut not all members of a species. As more whole-genome\nsequences of a species or group within a species become\navailable, the size of the pan-genome of that species or\ngroup will usually increase, due to an increase in the num-\nber of accessory genes. Based on mathematical models, it\nis predicted that new genes will be discovered within the\npan-genome of many free-living bacterial species even\nafter hundreds or possibly thousands of complete genome\nsequences have been characterized [6]. While originally\napplied to an entire species, any group of related strains\ncan be said to contain a“ core ” and “ accessory ” set of\ngenes. As such, tools that extract the new pieces of infor-\nmation from an extremely large pool of data and that can\nbe used to determine the pan-genome and its distribution\namong strains will be invaluable in the study of genotypic\nand phenotypic traits in bacterial populations.\nRegardless of whether an investigator uses a draft or\nfinished sequence, software tools able to efficiently\nextract relevant information are critical. A number of\nprograms have been designed to assist with the analysis\nof DNA sequence data. These include programs\ndesigned for multiple sequence alignments such as\nCLUSTAL W [7], T-COFFEE [8] and MUSCLE [9]; pro-\ngrams for local sequence comparison including FASTA\n[10] and BLAST [11]; and programs designed for whole-\ngenome comparisons such as MUMmer [12], MAUVE\n[13] and MISHIMA [14]. Pre-computed alignments of\ncompleted genomes are available online from Web-ACT\n[15] (which also allows up to five user-submitted com-\nparisons), the map-viewer and gMap database features\nfrom the National Center for Biotechnology Information\n[16], the MOSAIC web-server [17] and the prokaryotic\ngene-order database PSAT [18].\nPrograms designed specifically to find mobile genomic\nislands as opposed to regions of differing sequence\nbetween or among genomes using comparative genomic\napproaches include MobilomeFINDER [19] and Island-\nPick [20]. Three programs offering in silico subtractive\nhybridization among genomes using BLAST are available:\nFindTarget [21], mGenomeSubtractor [22] and nWay-\nComp [23]. See Additional File 1 for a comparison of\nfeatures among many of these programs.\nDespite the myriad program options available, there is\nno comprehensive package for pan-genome analysis.\nPrior to the advent of the current generation of sequen-\ncing platforms, the number of genome sequences avail-\nable for intra-species comparative genomic analysis and\nfor the determination of“ accessory” genes was limiting;\nconsequently, tools specifically designed for the analysis\nof the pan-genome have not been available.\nMost studies have used one or two reference genomes,\nwhich include the core elements but are missing much\nof the accessory genome of the species in study. In the\nlaboratory, selective subtract ive hybridization [24,25]\nand population surveys using microarray comparative\ngenomics [26,27] have been used to examine/define\naccessory genome content. With the current explosion\nin availability of whole-genome draft sequences, it\nwould be highly desirable to exploit this information\nthrough in silico analysis to separate the novel accessory\ncomponent of the genome from previously identified\ncore sequence without the requirement for a finished\nassembly. Identifying novel accessory sequences in this\nway has application in characterizing novel metabolic\npathways, virulence attributes [28], and molecular\nfingerprinting targets useful in epidemiological and\npopulation genetic studies [29]. Finally, both the core\nand accessory genomes can be helpful in elucidating the\nevolutionary history of organisms [30].\nIn this study we describe a pan-genome sequence ana-\nlysis program, Panseq, that extracts novel regions with\nrespect to a sequence or group of sequences, determines\nthe core and accessory regions of sequences based on\nsequence identity and segmentation length parameters,\ncreates files based on the core and accessory genome for\nuse in phylogeny programs and determines the most\ndiscriminatory and variabl e set of loci from a dataset.\nWe also report the validation of Panseq outputs using\nPCR experiments and comparisons to previously\npublished genome sequence analyses.\nImplementation\nT h ep a n - g e n o m es e q u e n c ea n a l y s i sp r o g r a m( P a n s e q )\nwas written in Perl with BioPerl [31] modules and is\navailable at http://76.70.11.198/panseq.

BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:461\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/461\nPage 2 of 14\npresent in the database but present in a user-defined\ncombination of input sequences are extracted. This is\naccomplished using the MUMmer alignment program\n[12] with the “ novel ” sequences extracted into a file\nwith sequence location information added to the\nFASTA header. This process is iterative, adding the\ninitial sequence examined to the database before exam-\nining the second sequence, and so on until all sequences\nhave been examined. Because the algorithm examines all\nmatches given user-specifi ed criteria, regions of high\nsequence identity will also be matched independent of\ntheir order (non-syntenic). A summary file indicating\nthe size distribution of fragments and total number of\nnovel nucleotides is created, as well as a graphical repre-\nsentation of the novel regions distributed among all\ninput sequences in scalable vector graphic (SVG) form.\nDefault Nucmer parameters used by the NRF module\nare: b:200, c:50, d:0.12, g:100 and l:20; where according\nto the MUMmer manual http://mummer.sourceforge.\nnet/manual/#nucmer, b: the distance an alignment will\nextend poor scoring regio ns; c: the minimum cluster\nlength; d: the maximum diagonal difference (diagonal\ndifference/match separation); g: the maximum gap\nbetween two adjacent matches in a cluster; l: the mini-\nmum length of an exact match.\nCore and Accessory Genome Finder (CAGF)\nThe CAGF module considers for the purposes of ana-\nlyses the “ pan-genome ” to be comprised of sequences\nselected as input to the program. Panseq initiates using\nas i n g l es e q u e n c ef i l ea sas e e dt ow h i c ha l lo t h e r\nsequences are compared using MUMmer. If a segment\ngreater than the‘Minimum Sequence Size’ is found in a\nsequence other than the seed, that segment is added to\nthe “ pan-genome ” . This newly-added-to “ pan-genome ”\nis used as the reference for subsequent comparisons and\nthe process continues iteratively until all sequences have\nbeen examined. Panseq next fragments the entire pan-\ngenome into segments of user-defined length and\ndetermines the presence or absence of each of these\nfragments in each of the original sequences based on\nthe percent sequence identity cutoff using the BLASTn\nalgorithm [11], with the following default parameters:\nblastall -p blastn -W 11, -b (2*<number of input\nsequences>) -v (2*<number of input sequences>)\n-e 0.001, -F F. Fragments above the cutoff found in every\noriginal sequence are considered part of the“ core” gen-\nome, while fragments below the cutoff in at least one\nstrain are considered part of the“ accessory” genome.\nThe core genome for each input sequence is concate-\nnated into a single sequence and a multiple sequence\nalignment is produced. The accessory genome is\nreported in a tab-delimited table, where binary (0 for\nabsence, 1 for presence) data indicate the state of each\nfragment in the original sequences. A NEXUS formatted\nfile [32] for both the accessory and core genomes are\noutput for use in downstream phylogenetic applications.\nPanseq also produces a SNP file containing core\nsegments with sequence variability; a tabular file listing\neach SNP, its position, and value among each original\nsequence; “ core ” and “ accessory ” genomes output to\nseparate FASTA files; and a scalable vector graphic\ndepicting the pan-genome and its presence/absence\namong all of the original input sequences.\nLoci Selector (LS)\nThe LS module constructs loci sets that are maximized\nwith respect to the unique number of fingerprints\nproduced among the input sequences as well as the\ndiscriminatory power of the loci among the input\nsequences. The LS module iteratively builds the final loci\nset, in the following steps, given a tab-delimited table\nwith loci names in the first column, sequence names in\nthe first row, and single character data filling the matrix:\n(1) Each potential available locus is evaluated for the\nnumber of unique fingerprints that would result from\nits addition to the final loci set. All loci that would gen-\nerate the maximum number of unique fingerprints in\nthis respect are evaluated in step (2).\n(2) All loci from step (1) are evaluated for their discri-\nminatory power among the sequences, which is given as\npoints of discrimination (POD). The POD for a locus is\ncalculated as follows.\nA listing of all possible pair-wise comparisons is con-\nstructed; for example, if the input table consisted of\nt h r e es e q u e n c e s ,A ,Ba n dC ,t h el i s tw o u l dc o n s i s to f\nA-B, A-C and B-C. Next, it is determined whether or\nnot the sequences in each pair-wise comparison contain\nthe same single character denoting the locus state. If\nthey do, a value of 0 is assigned; if they differ a value of\n1i sa s s i g n e d .T h eP O Di st h e nt h es u m m a t i o no fa l l\npair-wise comparisons that differ for that locus. With\nour previous example, if A-B = 1, A-C = 1 and B-C = 0,\nthe POD for that locus would be 2.\n(3) The locus with the highest value from step (2) is\nselected for addition to the final loci set and removed\nfrom the pool of candidate loci. If two or more loci tie\nin value, one is randomly selected. If all possible unique\nfingerprints have been found, the algorithm continues\nwith (4); if additional unique fingerprints are possible,\nthe algorithm continues with (5).\n(4) Sequence pairs for which the allele of the locus\nchosen in (3) differ are excluded from the analysis. This\nensures loci that differ between other pairs of strains are\npreferentially considered. Consider our A, B and C\nexample with pair-wise comparisons of A-B = 1, A-C =\n1a n dB - C=0 .I nt h ec a s eo ft h i sl o c u sb e i n gc h o s e n ,\nthe sequence pairs A-B and A-C would be temporarily\nLaing et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:461\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/461\nPage 3 of 14\nremoved from the analysis (“ masked” ), leaving only loci\nthat differed between B-C as viable options.\n(5) Once a locus has been chosen:\na) the specified number of loci has been reached (all\nunique fingerprints in the case of ‘best ’)a n dt h e\nalgorithm terminates; or\nb) the specified number of loci has not been reached\nand there are remaining fingerprints possible, or\nsequence pairs for which differences exist. The algo-\nrithm returns to (1); or\nc) there are no remaining fingerprints possible and\nno sequence pairs for which differences exist. At\nsuch time, all sequence pairs are again considered\npart of the analysis (\"unmasked” ). If no differences\namong any sequence pairs e xist at this point, the\nalgorithm terminates; if differences remain, the\nalgorithm returns to (1).\nResults and Discussion\nWe have used a number of examples to highlight the\nfunctionality of Panseq, many of which could be carried\nforward as complete studies of their own; however, our\nintention is to demonstrate that Panseq is capable of\nfinding and extracting useful data from sequences,\nwhich can be used as the basis for hypothesis generation\nand future investigations.\n(1) Novel Region Finder (NRF) Module\nAlignment programs are capable of finding regions of\nsimilarity between sequences, and regions of uniqueness\ncan be inferred from the gaps between areas with high\nsequence similarity. However, a number of steps are\nrequired using alignment programs to identify genomic\nregions that are unique with respect to other sequence\n(s). These steps include the location of the sequence\ncoordinates for each sequence of interest and the subse-\nquent location of the corresponding sequence in a\nsequence editor. Panseq automates this process, creating\nFASTA files of all unique regions of a given sequence or\nsequences as well as presenting a graphical overview of\nthe locations of the novel regions, based on the results\nof sequence comparisons made using the MUMmer\nalgorithm. MUMmer was chosen as the sequence align-\nment engine because of its use of suffix-trees, which\nallow it to perform operations up to 100 times faster\nthan similar alignment programs in whole-genome com-\nparisons [12].\nDetermining putative functions for the regions identi-\nfied by the NRF module can be accomplished by com-\nparing the translated nucleotide sequences to known\nprotein sequences using the Panseq links to NCBI\nBLASTx [11] or the UniProt database [33]. This linking\nallows the genomic information to be easily queried and\nis a logical first step in connecting genotype to pheno-\ntype in comparative genomics analyses.\nThe NRF Module in Genomic Island Identification\nNovel regions have the potential to affect virulence and\nniche specificity of pathogenic microorganisms. In 2000,\nPerna et al. [34] published the complete genomic\nsequence of the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 strain\nEDL933 and compared it to the previously sequenced,\nnon-pathogenic laboratory E. coli K12 strain MG1655.\nGenomic regions found inE. coli O157:H7 EDL933 but\nnot in K12 were called“ O-Islands” and genomic regions\npresent in K12 but not EDL933 were termed\n“ K-Islands ” . Perna et al. found 177 O-Islands greater\nthan 50 bp in E. coli O157:H7 EDL933, constituting\n1.34 Mb and 234 K-Islands greater than 50 bp in the\nK12 strain MG1655, representing 0.53 Mb. They deter-\nmined the presence of these islands using a custom\nmodification of the MUMmer program [12] and found\nthat many of the genomic regions in strain EDL933\nwere bacteriophage-related and suggested that they may\nplay a role in the virulence of the organism.\nUsing Panseq, we re-analy zed the genome sequence\ndata used in these experiments with the NRF module,\nchecking “ Unique among the sequences selected ” to\ngenerate both sets of genomic islands in a single step.\nPerna et al. [34] defined islands as regions with less\nthan 90% sequence identity over 90% of the sequence\nlength. We found that genomic islands identified in this\nprevious analyses can extend into conserved regions,\ncombining multiple islands into a single contiguous\nsequence that is interspersed with regions of high\nsequence identity. Similarly, genomic islands may be\nmisclassified as core regions simply because of heteroge-\nneous composition with interspersed core and accessory\nsequences in regions of high heterogeneity. Panseq uses\nparameters optimized for high-resolution comparison of\ngenomic sequences and we found that it more strin-\ngently defined islands unique to a genome sequence.\nWith default program settings (Nucmer values of\nb:200, c:50, d:0.12, g:100, l:20) and a minimum novel\nregion size of 50 bp, Panseq identified 214 K- and 304\nO-Islands, compared with the 234 K- and 177 O-Islands\nof Perna et al. [34]; a detailed comparison of the find-\nings can be found in Additional File 2. As a result of\ndifferences in the stringency between the two methods,\npresent but heterogeneous islands such as K-Island #4\nwere not identified as islands by Panseq; K-island #4\nmatches at 90% sequence identity for 84 bp at positions\n111429 - 11511 in K-12 and 116035 - 116118 in\nE D L 9 3 3 .T h i sr e p r e s e n t sa ne x a m p l eo fm o d e s td i f f e r -\nences in core sequence rather than of “ novel ” regions\nthat comprise the accessory genome (see also below the\ndiscussion of identity thresholds). Additionally, islands\nLaing et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:461\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/461\nPage 4 of 14\nidentified by Perna et al. with interspersed regions of\nhigh sequence identity were split and refined into sepa-\nrate islands by Panseq; for example O-island #7 was\nsplit into four unique islands, eliminating the regions of\nhigh sequence identity. These results demonstrate that\nPanseq can correctly identify and rapidly extract novel\ngenomic sequences.\nTwo-way comparisons similar to those used forE. coli\nstrains K-12 and EDL933 have been used to identify\ngenetic attributes which confer distinct phenotypes on\nmany other taxonomically related strain pairs. This type\nof analysis has allowed researchers to identify elements\nunique to each strain and suggest putative functions for\nthese elements in the life cycles of the respective organ-\nisms, their virulence and their ability to survive in differ-\nent niches. Examples of such studies include the\nidentification of genetic differences between the human-\nrestricted Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar\nTyphi, and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica sero-\nvar Typhimurium, which is a murine pathogen but is not\nhost-restricted [35]; and the differences between the\nhost-restricted causative agent of plague,Yersinia pestis\nand the enteric pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis\n[36]. While these types of two strain comparison studies\nhave been extremely insightful, studies using programs\nsuch as Panseq will greatly facilitate these comparisons\nand also allow comparisons between multi-strain groups.\nThe NRF Module in Multiple Sequence Comparisons\nTo demonstrate a comparison of recently sequenced\ngenomes to previously completed “ reference ” genomic\nsequences, we used the two draft genome sequences of\nListeria monocytogenes F6900 and 10403S and compared\nthem to the four completeL. monocytogenes genomes in\nGenbank: Clip81459, EGD-e, HCC23 and 4bF2365\n(Table 1). The NRF module found 45 novel regions\n≥500 bp, constituting 126858 bp of genomic DNA not\npresent in the four referenceL. monocytogenes genomes.\nThe size distribution of the novel regions from the out-\nput file is presented in Figure 1. In addition to the sum-\nmary file, the novel regions are output in FASTA format\nwith sequence location and size information found in\nthe header. These files are suitable for additional\nbioinformatic or phylogenetic analysis. In addition to\nthe FASTA file, an SVG graphics file showing the loca-\ntion of the novel regions in each strain is optionally\nprovided. As can be seen in Figure 1, the greatest num-\nber of novel regions was found in the 1000 -2000 bp\nrange, with 38 of the 45 regions less than 4000 bp in\nsize.\nExperimental Confirmation of Outputs from the NRF\nModule\nWe wished to experimentally confirm the uniqueness of\nthe novel regions extracted by Panseq. To do this, we\ndetermined genomic regions present in at least one of\n14 E. coli O157:H7 whole genome sequences (Table 2)\nbut absent from the two O157:H7 reference genomes\nEDL933 and Sakai. We designed primers targeting 65 of\nthese novel regions and examined the distribution of the\nregions among a population of 60 E. coli O157:H7\nstrains. All of the primer pairs generated amplicons in\nat least one but not all of theE. coli O157:H7 strains\nother than EDL933 and Sakai, and all failed to amplify\nDNA from E. coli O157 EDL933 and Sakai, as predicted\nby Panseq (data not shown). This experimentally\ndemonstrated that the sequences identified by Panseq\nrepresent novel accessory regions not found in the two\nreference E. coli O157:H7 genomes.\n(2) Core/Accessory Genome Finder (CAGF) Module\nThe Panseq CAGF module uses a combination of frag-\nmentation and sequence identity thresholding to define\naccessory and core genomic regions. To determine the\neffect of the sequence identity cutoff on core/accessory\ngenome size, we examined groups ofL. monocytogenes,\nE. coli O157:H7, Clostridium difficile and C. jejuni\ngenomes with a fragmentation size of 500 bp (~ half the\nsize of an average gene) over a range of sequence iden-\ntity cutoffs (Figure 2). The size of the estimated acces-\nsory genome increased as the sequence identity\nthreshold was raised, and the size of the estimated core\ngenome decreased proportionally; however, this increase\nwas observed to have two distinct phases: an initial lin-\near growth in accessory genome size that was followed\nby an exponential increase in accessory genome size.\nThe transition between the two stages occurred in the\n80 - 90% sequence identity cutoff range for each species,\nsuggesting that with values below 80% Panseq primarily\nidentified accessory genome segments that were variably\nabsent or present whereas above this threshold Panseq\nidentified core genome segments with sequence\nheterogeneity.\nThe CAGF Module in SNP Analysis of the Core Genome\nAccessing the core genome is important for phylogenetic\nstudies, which have used“ core” gene concatenates ran-\nging in size from a few genes in multi-locus sequence\ntyping (MLST) schemes for Campylobacter jejuni [37]\nTable 1 The 6Listeria monocytogenes genomic sequences\nanalyzed, with RefSeq accession numbers and genomic\nsequence status\nRefSeq Accession No. Strain Genome Status\nNC_002973 4b F2365 Complete\nNC_003210 EGD-e Complete\nNC_011660 HCC23 Complete\nNC_012488 Clip81459 Complete\nNZ_AARU02 F6900 Draft\nNZ_AARZ02 10403S Draft\nLaing et al.

In addition to offering the best\navailable data for assessing the phylogenetic reconstruc-\ntion of the evolutionary history of an organism, a small\nnumber of single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) can\nbe useful in defining clusters of epidemiologically related\nstrains [40-42].\nWe analyzed the sixL. monocytogenesstrains in Table 1\nwith the CAGF module of Panseq, using a fragmentation\nsize of 500 bp and a sequence identity cutoff of 85%. The\nresulting concatenated core data, which include all con-\nserved nucleotides and SNPs, were used to construct a\nmaximum parsimony (MP) tree using Phylip v3.69 [43].\nA MP tree was also generatedin silico for the same six\nstrains using the L. monocytogenes MLST protocol out-\nlined by Nightingale et al. [38], for comparative purposes\n(Figure 3). The symmetric distance between the two trees\nshows that the overall topology of the trees differ\nbetween that created from MLST data and that based on\nthe entire concatenated core. This is likely due to the fact\nthat the MLST protocol only considers seven genes,\nwhere disproportionate variation among these few loci\nand the relative paucity of loci compared to that of the\nentire core genome can reduce the ability of this method\nto capture the overall relationships among strains. With\nthe continued increase in sequencing throughput, settling\nfor rough approximations of true tree topologies may no\nlonger be necessary.\nThe CAGF Module in the Analysis of the Accessory Genome\nWhile SNP analysis has proven to be an extremely use-\nful tool, the ideal reconstruction of an evolutionary his-\ntory would take into account not only the heterogeneity\nFigure 1Size distribution ofListeria monocytogenes strains F6900 and 10403S novel regions.

Although varia-\ntion in the core genome among a small number of loci\nmay be sufficient for identifying clusters of related\nstrains, discrimination among strains is often more diffi-\ncult because there is less variation and fewer phylogen-\netically informative loci, leading to fewer genotypes.\nAccessory genome content, which can be highly variably\namong strains, appears in many cases to be consistent\nwith phylogenetic analyses of core genes and as a result\nTable 2 The 14E. coli O157:H7 strains compared by\nPanseq to theE. coli O157:H7 reference strains EDL933\nand Sakai for novel accessory genomic regions\nRefSeq Accession No. Strain\nNZ_ABJT00000000 Escherichia coli O157:H7 str.

Analysis of accessory gene con-\ntent thus presents an opportunity to integrate valuable\nlinks to phenotype into a genetic classification scheme.\nTo examine the performance of accessory genome\ninformation for phylogenetic reconstruction, we used\nthe binary presence/absence data of the accessory gen-\nome computed for the set of six L. monocytogenes\nstrains above, and constructed a MP tree (Figure 3).\nWhen comparing the tree topology of this accessory-\nbased tree to that of the SNP-based core tree and the\nMLST tree, we found that the core- and accessory-\nbased MP trees had an identical topology, but differed\nfrom the MLST-based tree in the placement of the two\nstrains 10403S and F6900. Further studies will be\nrequired to determine the extent of the phylogenetic\nconcordance between the core genome and the acces-\nsory genome among other bacterial groups.\nThe CAGF Module in the Examination of Pan-Genomic\nDifferences\nAs well as producing a concatenated core, the CAGF\nmodule also produces a table listing each SNP and its\nlocation and allele within each original sequence. This\ncan be useful in examining individual differences or for\nhierarchical clustering of data. To demonstrate how the\nresults of Panseq can be visualized, both tabular output\nfiles from theListeria core/accessory analysis were used\nto create hierarchical clustering dendrograms: one based\non the SNP character data from the core regions (Figure\n4) and the other based on the binary presence/absence\ndata of the accessory regions (Figure 5). Both dendro-\ngrams have the same tree topology, and the underlying\ndata for both core and accessory regions shows only the\ndifferences among the genomic sequences, making com-\nparisons between strains clearer than they might be\nfrom whole-genome comparisons where conserved as\nwell as variable loci are considered in the analysis.\n(3) The Loci Selector (LS) Module\nMolecular fingerprinting methods such as SNP analysis,\nmulti-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis\n(MLVA) and comparative genomic fingerprinting (CGF)\n[ 2 9 ]o f t e nr e l yo nas m a l ln u m b e ro fl o c it od i f f e r e n t i a t e\namong a large number of bacterial strains. Determining\nwhich loci to use in a scheme requires selecting from, in\nsome cases, thousands of loci. While manual inspection\nof a dataset is required to determine biologically relevant\nloci, Panseq provides an automated way to empirically\ndetermine the most variable and discriminatory loci from\nan investigator-defined set of variable character data\nFigure 3 Maximum parsimony trees generated from MLST, accessory and core genome data fromListeria monocytogenes strains.

Panseq was able to sort through\nthe data to generate a single group of loci that con-\ntained not only the most unique profiles, but that pro-\nvided the most discrimination among the input\nsequences, completing the task in one s.\nThe LS Module in the Analysis of SNP Genotyping Data\nAny variable character data can be used as inputs in the\nLS module. To illustrate the functionality of the LS mod-\nule, we used a set of 96 SNPs identified from E. coli\nO157:H7 by Manning et al. [47], for which the nucleotide\nvalue of each SNP was determined among a set of 17\nE. coli O157:H7 genomic sequences [48]. This dataset\nwas first modified to represent any unknown character\nwith the‘?’ symbol, and to replace any locus described by\ntwo characters with a single character (Additional File 5).\nThis dataset was analyzed by the LS module to give\nthe 20 best loci from the 96 available. The results are\npresented in Table 3, and show that the first locus\nselected by Panseq was ECs2696, a locus with three\nalleles and therefore more initial fingerprints than any\nother locus except ECs2006, which also had three alleles\namong the strains. However, ECs2696 provided more\nPOD among the strains than ECs2006 and was thus\nselected by Panseq as the initial locus. The eighth locus\nadded (ECs5359) was the last to provide unique strain\nsequence profiles. This locus differentiated the K-12\nstrain and E. coli O157:H7 strains EC508 and EC71074.\nEvery subsequent locus (9-20) was chosen by the pro-\ngram for its ability to offer discrimination among the\nremaining strain pairs, while ensuring that highly vari-\nable loci that contain very similar allele patterns among\nstrains (i.e are not informative) did not replace loci in\nthe set that offered discrimination among fewer, but\nnevertheless diverse strains.\nAdvantages of Panseq over Other Related Programs\nWhile many sequence analys is programs exists, some\nwith overlapping capabilities, no two are identical with\nrespect to the tasks they perform. With enough time\nand knowledge one can parse the output of a sequence\nalignment program such as BLAST or MAUVE manu-\nally, but there is a considerable time savings and ease of\nuse with a program such as Panseq that automates the\nprocess. Panseq is unique in its single-step novel region\nfinding options among groups and specific to individual\nsequences, which other in silico subtractive programs\nsuch as mGenomeSubtractor [22] and nWayComp [23]\nlack. Panseq also provides a comprehensive analysis of\nthe pan-genome, automatically generating analyses that\ncan only be partially accomplished by any other single\nprogram; eg. With MAUVE [49] a list of SNPs can be\ngenerated and a display of the similarities/differences\nbetween the genomes is produced, but the underlying\nnucleotide sequence is not automatically extracted. With\nPanseq, the underlying sequence data is automatically\nextracted, the segments compared among all sequences\nand presented in tabular form and input files for phylo-\ngenetic programs are automatically created. Further, the\nSNP table or binary presence/absence table of the acces-\nsory genome can be used directly in the LS module, for\nthe selection of the most discriminatory loci.\nConclusion\nWe have developed Panseq, a freely available online pro-\ngram to quickly find and extract strain- or group-specific\nnovel accessory genomic information as well as the com-\nplete pan-genome for a group of genomic sequences.\nPanseq produces alignments of the core genome of each\nsequence and determines the distribution of accessory\nregions among all sequences analyzed. Panseq makes use\nof the MUMmer alignment algorithm for whole genome\ncomparisons and the BLASTn algorithm for local\nsequence comparisons and can efficiently compute values\nfor large numbers of sequences. Additionally, Panseq is\nable to rapidly identify the most variable and discrimina-\ntory loci set in an iterative manner from single character\ntabular data.\nAvailability and Requirements\nProject name: Panseq\nProject home page: http://76.70.11.198/panseq\nOperating system(s): Platform independent\nProgramming language: Perl\nOther requirements : Firefox 2.0+, Internet Explorer\n6.0+, Google Chrome or compatible web-browser\nLicense: Freely available\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Comparison of Sequence Analysis Programs.\nA feature comparison of currently available web-servers and standalone\nsequence analysis programs.\nAdditional file 2: Genomic Island Comparison.
