  "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Outpatient clinical notes are a rich source of information regarding drug safety. However, data in these notes are currently underutilized for pharmacovigilance due to methodological limitations in text mining. Large language models (LLM) like BERT have shown progress in a range of natural language processing tasks but have not yet been evaluated on adverse event detection. Methods We adapted a new clinical LLM, UCSF BERT, to identify serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring after treatment with a non-steroid immunosuppressant for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We compared this model to other language models that have previously been applied to AE detection. Results We annotated 928 outpatient IBD notes corresponding to 928 individual IBD patients for all SAE-associated hospitalizations occurring after treatment with a non-steroid immunosuppressant. These notes contained 703 SAEs in total, the most common of which was failure of intended efficacy. Out of 8 candidate models, UCSF BERT achieved the highest numerical performance on identifying drug-SAE pairs from this corpus (accuracy 88-92%, macro F1 61-68%), with 5-10% greater accuracy than previously published models. UCSF BERT was significantly superior at identifying hospitalization events emergent to medication use (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions LLMs like UCSF BERT achieve numerically superior accuracy on the challenging task of SAE detection from clinical notes compared to prior methods. Future work is needed to adapt this methodology to improve model performance and evaluation using multi-center data and newer architectures like GPT. Our findings support the potential value of using large language models to enhance pharmacovigilance.",

This 184 \nis particularly t rue of non-st eroid immun osuppressan ts which are commonly nee ded long-term for t he 185 \ntrea tmen t of inflammatory bowel dise ases (IBD).  186 \nExisting appro aches for AE surveillanc e may involve prospective regist ry studies, spontan eous 187 \npostmarke ting repo rting (e.g. , the F ood and Drug Administra tion’s AE R epor ting System [FAERS]) 1 , 188 \nlitera tur e search es, and/or a nalyses of th e structu red da ta from claims and el ectr onic health r ecords 189 \ndatabas es 2,3 . These appro aches have pr o vided importan t dat a on th e postma rket safety of medications 190 \nbut are limi ted by exp ense , small numbe rs, under/over-r epor ting 4,5 , missing data,  limitations in infer ring 191 \ncausality, and subop timal sensi tivity and specificity. Clinical notes ar e a rich sourc e of AE data beca use 192 \ntrea ting clinicians often d ocument ac tion s in response to p ote ntial AEs, including t reatment 193 \ndiscontinua tion and hospi taliz ation . How ever, th ese no tes have be en unde rutili ze d for surveillance due 194 \nto meth odological limita tions in effective  tex t mining.  195 \nRecent ye ars have see n impressive adva nces in natura l language proc essing following the rele ase of 196 \nthe larg e language model known as BERT  (Bidirectional Encod er Rep rese nta tions from Transformers) 6 . 197 \nHowever, its ad apta tion t o domain-speci fic arenas like medical language h as been  limited, in par t due t o 198 \nthe unavaila bility of safe platforms for pr ocessing this prot ecte d heal th informati on until rec ently. I n 199 \nprior work, our gr oup of academic res ear chers has develop ed a new BERT model s pecifically designed to 200 \ninterp re t clinical te xt as typically docume nted in el ectro nic heal th recor ds (EHR) s ystems 7 . This model, 201 \nUCSF BERT, was trained on 75 million cli nical notes docume nte d across a range o f specialties over t he 202 \nlast 10 years at the Unive rsity of California, San Francisco (UCSF).
