Fjords\n1 Introduction\nThe coast of Norway is about 2000 km long from south to\nnorth. The average depth of the shelf along the coast is 300 m,\nand further offshore is the much deeper Norwegian sea.\nStretching in from the coast are numerous fjords, some with\ndeep basins that ranges down to 600–1300 m. Altogether, both\nthe bathymetry and topography of the Norwegian coastal\nareas are complicated.\nAlong the Norwegian coast flows the Norwegian Coastal\nCurrent (NCC). The NCC is primarily fed and mostly driven\nby freshwater from the Baltic and a large number of\nNorwegian rivers (Sætre 2007). Hence, the water masses are\nstratified from this variable but continuous supply of freshwa-\nter. The transport of the NCC is around 1 –2 Sv, and the current\nis wedge shaped with the deepest part towards the coast. Due\nto the layering, the dynamics are baroclinic. The NCC will\ntypically contain water with salinity less than 34.5, and out-\nside the NCC is the North Atlantic Current (NAC) with saltier\nwater above 35 (Sætre 2007). Both the NCC and the NAC\nflow side by side northward along the Norwegian coast.\nInside the fjords, the water has typically a three-layer struc-\nture (Inall and Gillibrand 2010; Stigebrandt 2012). At the top\nis a thin brackish layer of 1 –10 m depth. This layer is due to\nriver runoff inside the fjord, and its extent and depth are de-\npendent of the strength of the river discharge. In periods with\nlittle river discharge, this upper brackish layer will not be\npresent. Also, in the outer parts of long fjords, the brackish\nlayer might vanish due to various mixing processes. From the\nsurface (or under the brackish layer) and down to the sill depth\nThis article is part of the Topical Collection on the 11th International\nWorkshop on Modeling the Ocean (IWMO), Wuxi, China, 17-20\nJune 2019\nResponsible Editor: Shanlin Wang\n* Lars Asplin\nlars.asplin@imr.no\n1 Institute of Marine Research, PO Box 1870 Nordnes,\n5817 Bergen, Norway\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s10236-020-01378-0\n/ Published online: 6 May 2020\nOcean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\nof the fjord is the so-called intermediate layer. This water is in\ngood contact with the coastal water (Asplin et al. 1999;A s p l i n\net al. 2013). Below the sill depth, for many fjords, are more\nstagnant water being replaced relatively seldom compared to\nthe water above the sill depth (Gade and Edwards 1980;I n a l l\nand Gillibrand 2010).\nThe forcing of the water masses at the coast and in the\nfjords is very dynamic. Several forcing mechanisms are pres-\nent and the most important are wind, tide, freshwater runoff,\nand internal pressure due to spatial differences in stratification\n(horizontal pressure gradients). Norway is in the path of the\natmospheric polar front, and frequent strong wind episodes\ndue to low pressure passages occur. The duration of these is\ntypically modest, lasting for 1 –2 days in an episodic manner\n(Parding et al. 2019). The tide consists of a Kelvin wave prop-\nagating along the Norwegian coast from south to north\n(Gjevik and Straume 1989). The M2 constituent is the leading\nmode. Amplitudes of sea level oscillations vary from 0.25 m\nin the south to 2 m in the north. Into the fjords, the tide will\npropagate as a barotropic wave, and topography and stratifi-\ncation can extract energy to mixing or to generate internal\nwaves (Farmer and Freeland 1983; Stigebrandt 2012). In the\ndeep and wide fjords, the current speed due to the tide will be\nmodest. Differences in the stratification between the coast and\nthe fjords can generate long internal waves in the intermediate\nwater layer with an associated current which can be both rel-\natively strong, have a large vertical extent and last for many\ndays (Asplin et al. 1999; Asplin et al. 2013). Thus, such inter-\nnal waves are the most important forcing for water exchange\nabove sill level inside the fjords and between the coastal ocean\nand the fjords. Altogether, the various forcing mechanisms in\ncombination with complex topography and the influence of\nthe rotation of the Earth make the current vary on many scales\nboth temporarily and spatially.\nThe environmental conditions along the Norwegian coast\nare suitable for cultivating Atlantic salmon. The temperature\nrange is well suited for salmon growth; it is possible to find\nlocations sheltered from the strongest winds and waves and the\ncurrent is sufficiently strong for a constant supply of oxygen\nrich water to the many fish in the open net pens (Oppedal et al.\n2011). During the last 40 –50 years, the salmon aquaculture\nalong the Norwegian coast has grown orders of magnitude\nw o r t hm o r et h a n6 0b i l l i o nN O Ki n2 0 1 8( S t a t i s t i c sN o r w a y ,\nwww.ssb.no). About 1.3 million tons are produced annually in\ntotal at more than 1000 fish farms spread along the coast, of\nwhich 5 –600 are in production at any time ( https://www.\nfiskeridir.no/Akvakultur/Tall-og-analyse/Akvakulturstatistikk-\ntidsserier/Laks-regnbueoerret-og-oerret/Matfiskproduksjon).\nSuch a large aquaculture industry comes with a cost for the\nenvironment with threats being escaping of farmed fish to the\nwild, discharge of effluents like feces, feed spill or other\norganic and inorganic matter, and transmission of diseases\nfrom farmed fish to the wild (Taranger et al. 2015).\nThe Norwegian Government has decided that the salmon\naquaculture industry in Norway shall grow but only within\nsustainable limits, and the limiting factor now is the carrying\ncapacity of the parasite salmon louse on the wild salmon stock\n(Ministry of Trade Industry and Fisheries 2015; Taranger et al.\n2015). The Institute of Marine Research (IMR) is one of the\ninstitutions responsible for giving advice on environmental\neffects of aquaculture to the authorities, and how to quantify\nthe carrying capacity of salmon lice on the salmonid wild fish\npopulations has received a lot of attention in the latter ~\n15 years (Asplin et al. 2013; Johnsen et al. 2014, 2016;\nSandvik et al. 2016a , 2020 ; Skarðhamar et al., 2018\n;\nMyksvoll et al. 2018).\nThe salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis is a natural\nparasite in Norwegian waters that feeds on the skin, fat, and\nmucus of salmonid fish (Pike & Wadsworth 1999). With the\nindustrialization of aquaculture, the numbers of potential hosts\nhave increased, leading to unnaturally high lice infestations on\nboth farmed and wild fish (Finstad et al. 2000; Bjorn et al.\n2001; Heuch & Mo 2001; Heuch et al. 2009, 2011; Serra-\nLlinares et al. 2018). Salmon lice carry eggs in two eggstrings\nat the rear of the body. When these eggs hatch, the nauplii (lice\nlarvae) are released in the water, where they go through two\nnoninfectious nauplii stages before reaching the copepodite\nstage (Hamre et al. 2013). At this stage, they are able to —\nand are crucially dependent on — infecting salmonid fish.\nDuring these stages, lice are planktonic and drift with the\ncurrents. Due to their relatively long planktonic phase of 1 –\n3 weeks (Johnson and Albright 1991; Stien et al. 2005), infor-\nmation about the movement of the currents is crucial in order\nto determine the transport routes and residence areas.\nIn addition to a huge surveillance program for field obser-\nvations (Serra-Llinares et al. 2014), the IMR has established a\nnumerical modeling system estimating the abundance of salm-\non lice in time and space all along the Norwegian coast where\nthe aquaculture industry takes place (Myksvoll et al. 2018).\nOne challenge with the dispersion of salmon lice is the poten-\ntial large advection distance during the planktonic phase, up to\n~ 100 km (Asplin et al. 2013). Thus, any current model must\ncover a fairly large area. The solution to collect sufficient\ninformation in time and space was to establish an implemen-\ntation of the ROMS current model ( http://myroms.org) for the\nwhole Norwegian coast named the NorKyst800 (Albretsen\net al. 2011). This is a compromise between spatial grid reso-\nlution to resolve dynamics and topography and geographical\nextension necessary to capture the full advective distance of\nthe lice. The use of the ROMS as the current model is mainly\nfor historical reasons. When it first was implemented at IMR,\naround 2000, it was assumed to be the best alternative. Ocean\nmodels using unstructured grid (finite element, finite volume),\nwhich could have been attractive alternatives due to their more\nflexible handling of the coast, were not sufficiently established\nat that time. The ROMS is also used by the Norwegian\n1152 Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\nMeteorological institute which is a main collaborating partner\nfor the IMR.\nWe will show that the NorKyst800 model is a good appli-\ncation of this spatial compromise with results in good agree-\nment with observations. Results from the NorKyst800 are\nimportant information for many management purposes in\nNorway. Especially the use of NorKyst800 to drive a model\nfor dispersion of the salmon lice is important for Norwegian\nauthorities. Furthermore, the Norwegian Meteorological insti-\ntute is running NorKyst800 daily producing a 66-h forecast\n(https://thredds.met.no), which represents a valuable asset for\nmanagement agencies.\n2 Materials and methods\n2.1 The salmon lice dispersion model\n2.1.1 The current model\nWe have used the Regional Ocean Current Model System\n(ROMS) as the hydrodynamical model embedded in the\nNorKyst800 system (e.g., Shchepetkin and McWilliams\n2005; Haidvogel et al. 2008; or see http://myroms.org). In\nNorKyst800, we apply the sea ice module (Budgell 2005),\nb u tn ok i n do fd a t aa s s i m i l a t i o ni si m p l e m e n t e d .R O M Si sa\nstate-of- the-art, three-dimensional, free-surface, primitive\nequation numerical model using a generalized terrain-\nfollowing s-coordinate in the vertical. The s-coordinate levels\nare adjusted according to the total water depth between the\nfree surface and the bottom, keeping the same number of\nvertical coordinates for each horizontal grid cell. Our simula-\ntion applied s-levels with an enhanced resolution in the upper\n~ 50 m (the internal ROMS grid parameters were set equal to:\nVtransform = 2, Vstrething = 2, theta_s = 8.0, theta_b = 0.1,\nand Tcline = 20). Our simula tion was initiated in January\n1995 and presented here are results until 2018.\nThe bathymetry data were collected from the online data\nsource, http://www.norgedigitalt.no ,e s t a b l i s h e db yt h e\nNorwegian Mapping Authority, the Hydrographic service.\nThe original resolution is about 50 m on an irregular grid.\nThe coverage of Norge Digitalt data is for coastal zones\nonly, and GEBCO_08 data (General Bathymetric Chart of\nthe Oceans, http://www.gebco.net) were applied for the open\nocean. The resolution of the GEBCO_08 global bathymetric\ngrid is 30 arc-seconds, i.e., approximately 900 m. The merged\nproduct of Norge Digitalt high-resolution bathymetry and\nGEBCO bathymetry was interpolated to the NorKyst800 grid\n(see map of the model domain in Fig. 1). To avoid model\ninstability and/or spurious deep currents, the final masked\nbathymetry was smoothed (Beckmann and Haidvogel 1993).\nThe high-resolution atmospheric fields used to force the\nNorKyst800 model was provided by using the Weather\nResearch and Forecasting model (WRF), developed by the\nNational Center of Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The\nWRF model is a state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction\nmodel (Skamarock et al. 2008), and the implementation of the\nWRF model included a domain with horizontal grid resolution\nof 3 km, covering slightly more than the NorKyst800 domain.\nThe model was initialized with an analysis (on a 0.25° × 0.25°\nFig. 1 The model domain of\nNorKyst800 shown by the black\nrectangle in the map. Also\nincluded are the locations of\ncoastal monitoring stations (red\ncircles and corresponding names)\nand hydrography sections\n(magenta lines) regularly\nmeasured by the IMR. The four\nhydrographic transects are from\nSouth to North located in the\nSkagerrak (Torungen/Norway-\nHirtshals/Denmark), between\nUtsira/Norway and the Orkneys,\nNorthwest of Svinøy/Norway and\nbetween Fugløya/Norway and the\nBear Island\n1153Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\ngrid) of upper air and surface data from the European Centre\nfor Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and\nlateral boundary values were updated every 6th hour\nduring integration.\nAn important feature of the Norwegian coastal waters is the\nlarge supply of freshwater. From the Baltic sea, the net out-\nflow is approximately 15,000 m\n3/s (Sætre 2007). The input of\nBaltic outflow is provided through the nesting conditions from\nthe coarser model. From numerous rivers along the entire\nNorwegian coast, as much as 12,000 m\n3/s is discharged into\nthe Norwegian Coastal Current. The river runoff in\nNorKyst800 is based on modeled discharge from the 247 main\nNorwegian catchment areas that drain to the sea. The\nNorwegian river discharges are modeled by the NVE\n(Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate) using\na distributed version of the HBV-model with 1 km horizontal\nresolution (Beldring et al. 2003). Note that river discharges are\nestimated from natural variations in weather climate, and there\nare no modifications due to regulations by damming. Runoff\nvalues can then deviate from real discharge at some locations\nin cases where water is provided or restrained by dams. The\noutlets are positioned in the model grid at the location corre-\nsponding to the main river within the catchment area. In ad-\ndition, the discharge is distributed linearly from the surface\ndown to a prescribed depth for each river. This lower level\nof freshwater discharge varies with the total runoff, and the\nvertical shape of the runoff is kept constant throughout the\nmodel simulation.\nAs boundary conditions along the open boundaries, the\nmodel is forced by daily averaged currents, hydrography,\nand water level from a 4 km × 4 km resolution ROMS\nhindcast simulation (details in Lien et al. 2014). The tidal\nforcing is applied along the open boundaries and interpolated\nfrom the global TPXO7.2 (Egbert and Erofeeva 2002).\nFig. 2 The horizontal distribution\nof current at 10 m depth for\nAugust 1, 2018, simulated by the\nNorKyst800 current model. The\nlocations of current\nmeasurements at the coast and\ninside the Hardangerfjord are\nmarked. The Current meter fjord\nlocation within the\nHardangerfjord is named HfjE\n1154 Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\nROMS comes with a variety of lateral boundary condi-\ntions, including open, closed, and periodic (Marchesiello\net al. 2001). The Flather boundary condition (Flather\n1976) is used for the normal component of the barotropic\nvelocity to incorporate deviations from the exterior values\nat the speed of the external gravity waves. The corre-\nsponding condition for surface elevation (Chapman 1985)\nassumes that all incoming signals are integrated consistent-\nly with the shallow-water wave speed. As described by\nMarchesiello et al. ( 2001) and as applied in our model\nset-up, ROMS has an option for providing radiation con-\nditions on outflow and nudging to a known exterior value\non inflow for 3D momentum and tracers. This is imple-\nmented as a variation on the radiation condition, requiring\ntwo timescales, namely the inflow nudging timescale and\nthe outflow nudging timescale. Here, the nudging on in-\nflow is 120 times larger than on the outflow. For vertical\nturbulence, the local closure scheme is based on the ge-\nneric length scale (GLS) parameterization (Umlauf and\nBurchard 2003).\nFig. 3 Vertical gradient in temperature (upper row), salinity (mid row),\nand density (lower row) at 4 coastal stations from Utsira in the South to\nIngøy in the North during a period of 20 years (1995 –2015).

There are more than one thousand registered salm-\non farming sites in Norway. In 5 –600 of these, there is\nongoing production where reporting is mandatory\n(https://www.fiskeridir.no/Ak vakultur/Tall-og-analyse/\nAkvakulturstatistikk-tidsseri er/Laks-regnbueoerret-og-\noerret/Matfiskproduksjon ). The weekly reports from\nfarmers include water temperature and the average\nnumber of female lice on the fish.\nThe number of fish in the farms is reported monthly, and it\nis necessary to make an interpolation to weekly values. Based\non these reports, we estimate the number of hatched nauplii\nusing formulas in Stien et al. ( 2005). More details on these\ncalculations can be found in Myksvoll et al. ( 2018).\n2.1.3 The particle tracking model\nBased upon the modeled hydrography and currents, the open\naccess Lagrangian Advection and Diffusion Model (LADIM;\nhttps://github.com/bjornaa/ladim ) is used to calculate the\nparticle trajectories. The model solves the Lagrangian\nequation of motion, normally using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta\nscheme. In the vertical, the particles are given swimming be-\nhavior to mimic the observed behavior of salmon lice. The\nnumerical lice in the model are given vertical velocity directed\nupwards when exposed to light levels over a critical value. A\ngradually avoidance of water masses with low salinity (23 –\n31) is also included (Sandvik et al. 2020). A vertical random\nwalk is implemented to ensure variability between the parti-\ncles and to represent small-scale turbulence.

The\nSAIV SD204 has a sampling frequency of 1 Hz.\nThe hydrographic properties in NorKyst800 are evalu-\nated against the measurements from IMR ’s fixed coastal\nstations (see, e.g., Albretsen et al. ( 2012) and available\ndata from http://www.imr.no/fors kning/forskningsdata/\nstasjoner ). Vertical temperature and salinity profiles are\nmeasured 2 –4 times per month by local observers and time\nseries are available from the 1940s. Recently, the SAIV\nSD204 has been used. In addition, profiles from IMR ’s\nstandard hydrographical sections across the Skagerrak\n(10–12 times per year), Utsira-Orkneys (4 –5t i m e sp e r\nyear), off Svinøy (4 times per year), and Fugløya-Bear\nIsland (4 times per year) are applied to validate\nNorKyst800 for the surface waters (1 –10 m depth) and\nthe Atlantic waters (150 m depth is applied).

Observations from ~ 0.5 m depth are marked by red stars\n1158 Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\n3 Current model validation\nOur validation analysis is presented where the current model\nresults are compared with available observations of both cur-\nrent, salinity, and temperature. We have done this for both\ncoastal areas and fjord areas inside the Hardangerfjord, which\nis a representative fjord of medium to large size.\n3.1 Hydrography at the coast\nThe coastal stations with hydrographic measurements approx-\nimately 2–4 times per month act as a solid basis for evaluating\nthe seasonal and interannual deviations in the hydrodynamic\nmodel. It is vital to have a coastal model which is capable to\nreproduce the fluctuating density field along the coast as this\nhas major importance in deciding the direction and magnitude\nof along-fjord transports. In addition, a well-defined density\nfield will also act as valuable information for describing the\nphysical conditions.\nThe salinities observed at the coastal stations show water\nmasses with relatively low values along the coast. The 20-year\naverage temperature along the coast from the south to the\nnorth decreased from close to 9 °C at 10 m at Utsira, to 6 °C\nat Ingøy (Fig. 3). The temperatures have significant seasonal\nfluctuations, increasing in magnitude close to the surface. The\nwater column is strongly stratified, especially during spring\nand summer with positive heat flux from the atmosphere to the\nocean and peak run-off from land. The stratification of the\nwater column is stronger in the south compared to the north,\nboth according to salinity and temperature. The modeled hy-\ndrography from the 20-year archive of NorKyst800 results is\nsuccessfully able to reproduce the vertical temperature gradi-\nent within 1 °C precision, including seasonal variability. The\nvertical salinity gradient is underestimated by the model,\nshowing too high salinity of the water above ~ 125 –150 m\ndepth and slightly underestimating the salinity below.\nIn the upper 20 m of the water column, the salinity is\napproximately one standard deviation higher than the\nobserved mean. This offset is decreasing down to a\nminimum at about 125 –150 m depth.\nA closer look at the model bias in temperature and salinity\nis shown in Fig. 4. For temperature the model is about 0.2 –\nFig. 8 Time series of 24-h low-pass filtered modeled and observed North-South current at 20 m depth (top), a scatter plot (bottom left), a quantile-\nquantile plot (bottom middle), and a histogram (bottom right) from the coastal location\n1159Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\n0.5 °C too cold in the upper 100 m and exaggerates the cold\nbias slightly further down. The upper 50 m salinities are main-\nly too high in the model, but the magnitude varies between the\nlocations. The model overestimates the surface salinity at the\nsouthernmost stations, Lista and Utsira, while the model has\nslightly too low surface salinity at Sognesjøen.\nThe hydrographic variability along the Norwegian\ncoast is highest in the Skagerrak and decreases northward.\nThe standard deviation from the observations and the\nmodel results are very similar (not shown), and the model\nbiases in Fig. 4 have also been scaled with the standard\ndeviations to give estimates of a standardized model error.\nThe long-term standardized model error in temperature for\nthe upper 100 m is then very small, and with a negative\nincrease down to 200 m. The standardized model error in\nsalinity is mainly within the range from − 0 . 5t o0 . 5w i t h\nsome variations between depths and locations.\nWe have also evaluated the model against the standard\nhydrographical sections maintained by the IMR to detect if\nthere are any spatial offsets in the density field. The long-\nterm model error at 10 m depth, representing the surface wa-\nters, is shown in Fig. 5. We clearly see that the overestimated\nsurface salinities are mainly confined within the Norwegian\nCoastal Current off the southern Norway, and that model error\nis reduced considerably in offshore regions. Regarding surface\ntemperatures, the model is slightly too cold all over the model\ndomain. The long-term model error at 150-m depth,\nrepresenting the Atlantic waters, is shown in Fig. 6.W es e e\nthat the deep-water salinities are near unbiased in all regions\nand that the model is too cold, particularly close to the deepest\nparts of the Norwegian Sea.\n3.2 Hydrography in fjords\nInside the fjords, we have compared surface salinity (~\n0.5 m depth) at the location in the middle of the\nHardangerfjord (see location in Fig. 2). The time series\nof hourly values of salinity from NorKyst800 shows\nvalues above 30 until the spring, a gradual decrease of\nvalue down to about 20 in the summer and with increase\nagain up to above 30 in the late fall (Fig. 7). In the\nmeantime, there are episodes with values below 15 and\nabove 25. The observations from seven cruises have a\ngood fit with the model results, and all measurements\neither represent a long-te rm normal value or a short-\ntime fluctuating value.\nThe seasonality of the surface temperature within the\nHardangerfjord typically starts with cold water of about 5 °C\n(in 2018) until late spring, then an increase up to between 15\nand 20 °C in the summer and a decrease through the fall down\nto cold water again (Fig. 7). The daily-weekly variability of\nthe temperature is less pronounced than for the salinity, mostly\nwithin 1–2 °C. As for salinity, the observations have a good fit\nwith the model results.\nFig. 9 Time series of 24 h low-pass filtered time series of modeled and observed north-south current between 17 and 60 m depth at the coastal location\n1160 Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\n3.3 Currents at the coast\nFor comparison of current, we have data from one location at\nthe coast outside Bergen and one location inside the\nHardangerfjord (see map in Fig. 2). For the coastal location,\ncurrents were measured between April and November 2018.\nWe use values from approximately 20 m depth and the com-\nponent along the North-South direction for comparison. This\nrepresents the uppermost level measured by the current meter.\nThe directions north-south is close to the main flow direction.\nWe omit the high-frequency tidal flow in the presentation and\nfilter the time series with a 24-h 4th-order Butterworth low-pass\nfilter. The comparison (between the full time series including\nthe tides) is presented by displaying time series of north-south\ncurrent speed, scatter plot, quantile-quantile plot, and a frequen-\ncy histogram (Fig. 8). We illustrate the time series with 24 h\nlow-passed values (de-tided) while all other figures and values\nare based on a time resolution of 1 h. The comparison shows\ngood agreement. There are episodes not captured by the nu-\nmerical model, but the mean flow only differs by 0.02 m s\n−1\n(0.25 m s −1 vs. 0.23 m s −1) and the standard deviation by\n0.03 m s −1 (0.24 m s −1 vs. 0.27 m s −1). The root mean square\nerror is 0.25 m s −1. Although the mean speed for the entire\nmeasuring period is slightly underestimated in the model, we\nfind that the model slightly overestimates the highest speeds\ntowards the North. The latter can be attributed to a few episodes\nat the end of the period.\nThe vertical structure between 20 and 60 m depths also\nindicate a good fit between the observed and modeled north-\nsouth current component (Fig. 9).\n3.4 Currents inside the fjord\nInside the fjords, we compare the 24-h low-passed flow com-\nponent in the along-fjord direction at approximately 7 m depth\n(Fig. 10). Positive values represent flow into the fjord. In a\nfjord, the mean flow for a longer period will be small since\nalmost equal amounts of water will flow into and out of the\nfjord in a series of episodes lasting typically some days. In this\ncase, the mean flow at 7 m depth is 0.03 m s\n−1 from the\nobservation and 0.01 m s −1 from the model results, implying\nthat there is a small net inflow at this level and location. The\nstandard deviation of the current speed is comparable to the\nmean speed of the flow and equal for both the observation and\nFig. 10 Time series of 24 h low-pass filtered modeled and observed along fjord current at 7 m depth (top), a scatter plot (bottom left) a quantile-quantile\nplot (bottom middle) and a histogram (bottom right) from the fjord location\n1161Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\nthe model result (0.20 m s −1). The numerical model underes-\ntimates the strongest inflow, due to some episodes in\nSeptember and October.\n4 Salmon lice dispersion\nEvery week, an updated view of the abundance of salmon lice\ncopepodites is presented on the web page http://lakselus.no\n(Fig. 11). This is a result of 40-day dispersion simulation of\nplanktonic salmon lice from all salmon farms in production\nalong the entire Norwegian coast. The mean value for the last\n10 days of salmon lice copepodites in the whole water column\nis presented.\nTo illustrate the importance of detailed information of the\ncurrent, we will present results from the salmon lice model\nfrom the Sognefjord in spring 2017. The Sognefjord is the\nlargest fjord in Norway, and the abundance of salmon lice in\nthe spring 2017 was monitored by sentinel cages as part of the\nnational surveillance program. The number of lice on the fish\nin the sentinel cages for the first measuring period (May 10 –\n24) was low in the two innermost positions of the fjord, and\nslightly higher further out (Fig. 12, upper panel). For the sec-\nond period (May 24 to June 8), we found a large increase of\nlice on the fish in the innermost cages (Fig. 12, lower panel),\nand we will demonstrate how episodic, near-surface, inward\ncurrents explain this advection of salmon lice.\nBased on fish farmers reports, the highest production of\nsalmon lice nauplii were mostly concentrated in the mouth\nregion of the Sognefjord. Additionally, also the two innermost\nfarms had some nauplii production (Fig. 13). There are no\nfarms in the inner part of the fjord.\nTime series of model results from a location in the outer\nmouth region and a location in the inner part adjacent to the\ninnermost sentinel cages (positions marked by stars in Fig. 12)\nshow that until the middle of May there were only copepodites\nat the outer location (Fig. 14). Then, a substantial increase of\ncopepodites occurs in the outer part followed by an increase\nalso in the inner part a week later around May 23. This in-\ncrease in the inner part is due to an advection of copepodites\nfrom the outer part, as illustrated from the horizontal distribu-\ntion of copepodites at May 21 and May 23 (Fig. 15).\nFig. 11 Screendump of the web page http://lakselus.nowhere the weekly nowcasts of salmon lice copepodite abundance along the Norwegian coast are\npresented. Illustrated here is the distribution for week 48 of 2019\n1162 Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\n5 Discussion\nNumerical current model results validation is not an objec-\ntive exercise, and a never-ending effort should be made to\ncontinuously check the results (Dee 1995). Usually model\nvalidation consists of comparing model results with avail-\nable observations. A numerical current model can produce\ngood results while standard statistical error metrics as root-\nmean-square or cross-correlation compared to observed cur-\nrents still can be large (Ziegler et al. 2012). The reason is the\nlarge number of temporal and spatial oscillations that make\nup ocean currents, and that these oscillations can be slightly\nout of phase in the model results compared to observations.\nSuch a situation, with a narrow branch of current close to a\ncurrent meter location, can be seen in the model results of\ncurrents outside the Western Norway (Fig. 2). We find a\nrelatively high RMSE value of 0.25 m s\n−1 for this location.\nOceanographic observations are normally accurate but\nsparse in space and/or time, while hydrodynamic models\nare relatively continuous but with unknown error terms.\nFig. 12 Abundance of salmon lice on the fish in sentinel cages for two\nperiods in May–June 2017. Top figure shows the first period (May 10 to\n24), and the bottom figure shows the last period (May 24 to June 8).\nGreen colored circles indicate average number of lice on the fish less than\n1, yellow less than 10 and red more than 10 lice. Larger circle size\nindicates more lice. The blue stars show the locations where model time\nseries are extracted from\n1163Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\nThis issue has been further discussed and exemplified for the\nIngøy station (Sandvik et al. 2016b).\nOur results indicate that NorKyst800 compare reasonably\nwell both with observed hydrography as well as currents. The\ndeviation is typically within a unit of salinity and 1 °C of\ntemperature. Also, the variability of the observations is cap-\ntured well by the model results. The simulated currents are\nrealistic with a consistent match with the observations, and\nwith only a few episodic deviations.\nSince the variability of the model results compare well with\nthe observed variability, we can conclude that the model re-\nsults are realistic and describe something that can happen in\nnature. Thus, the model results are useful in investigations of\ngeneral properties as, e.g., connectivity between locations\n(Samsing et al., 2018). The model results are often good at\npredicting conditions at a given time, but due to occasional\nepisodic misfit between observed and modeled currents, we\ncannot trust the model results completely. Hence, this demon-\nstrates that additional current observations should be per-\nformed continuously along with model simulations as an in-\ndependent quality check.\nThe reason for the deviations between modeled and ob-\nserved current is most likely due to limitations in the forcing\napplied. Typically, the failing of the model to reproduce the\nobserved short but strong inflow events to the Hardangerfjord\nin September (Fig. 10) is probably due to discrepancies in the\nwind forcing and/or deviations in the offshore density and\nmomentum field.\nWe find that the horizontal grid resolution of 800 m ×\n800 m is sufficient to capture the physical conditions\nFig. 13 Nauplii production at fish farms in the Sognefjord between May 1 and 20. Black dots represent farm locations without production\nFig. 14 Time series of modeled copepodite density (cop m −2) from two positions in the Sognefjord marked by red stars in Fig. 12\n1164 Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\nreasonably well. Only in areas with narrow topography we\nwill need a higher resolution. A modification of the\nNorKyst800 named NorFjords160 contains 13 subareas cov-\nering the whole coast of Norway with 160 m × 160 m hori-\nzontal resolution and otherwise identical settings as\nNorKyst800. Occasionally, we need to do an extra simulation\nwith the NorFjords160 to reproduce transport patterns in more\nnarrow parts of the coast. However, the higher resolution\nmodel covering the entire Norwegian coast is ~ 50 times more\ndemanding in terms of computational cost.\nThe presented results from salmon lice dispersion in the\nSognefjord clearly illustrates that detailed information of cur-\nrent is needed to be able to describe the abundance of the lice.\nFrom the observations of the currents (Figs. 9 and 10), we see\nFig. 15 Simulated distribution of copepodites at May 21 and May 23, 2017, in the Sognefjord. The arrows represents the daily mean surface current as\ncalculated by the NorKyst800 model\n1165Ocean Dynamics (2020) 70:1151–1167\nthat numerous episodes of several days duration occur. Given\nthat the length of the water borne stages of the salmon lice are\ntwo to 3 weeks, the individual louse might experience several\ncurrent states during its drift and the resulting dispersion pat-\ntern will accordingly be variable.\nAs a final remark, we are satisfied with the good compar-\nison between the results of the NorKyst800 and available ob-\nservations. This model implementation has got an important\nrole as source of physical oceanographic information in\nNorway, and it is crucial that the results can be trusted.\nAcknowledgments This research combines work from various projects,\nincluding the Institute of Marine Research internal Fjord and coastal\nclimate project (internal project no. 14894), the Salmon lice surveillance\nprogram funded by the Norwegian Department of Trade, Industry and\nFisheries (internal project no. 14650), MORMOR (intenal poject no.\n15197), and Coast-risk project funded by the Norwegian Research\nCouncil (project no. 299554).
