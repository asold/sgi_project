I NTRODUCTION  \nI\nNCREASING the life span of costly assets is an essential \naspect in the operation and maintenance of power sys ‐\ntems .  In this regard ,  the heating of power transformers due \nto power losses is of paramount importance ,  which explains \nthe carefully designed cooling systems they have built in ,  \nusually based on heat - carrier fluids such as oil .\nIn order to anticipate the thermal behavior of an oil - im ‐\nmersed power transformer for given load conditions ,  dynam ‐\nic thermal models must be somehow considered .  This is the \ncase of [ 1 ],  where a hybrid numerical - analytical technique is \nproposed ,  or the bushing thermal model presented in [ 2 ]  to \ncalculate the hot - spot temperature .\nFinite - element methods ( FEMs )  can also be used for trans ‐\nformer thermal modeling .  Reference [ 3 ]  includes a 3 D mag ‐\nneto - thermal model for the metallic cover ( tank )  of the trans ‐\nformer ,  while [ 4 ]  studies the effect of harmonic conditions in \nthe hot - spot temperature .\nThose dynamic thermal models are represented by a sys ‐\ntem of differential - algebraic equations ,  involving a set of pa ‐\nrameters related to the particular characteristics of the trans ‐\nformer under consideration .  An accurate knowledge of these \nparameters is required to properly calculate the temperature \nat different points of the transformer .  In this context ,  parame ‐\nter estimation techniques can be applied to the dynamic ther ‐\nmal model of the power transformer ,  such as those used in \n[ 5 ],  where the sensitivity of the estimated parameters in lin ‐\near and nonlinear regression models is analyzed .  Genetic al ‐\ngorithms are also considered for this purpose in [ 6 ].\nIn this paper ,  a dynamic state estimator ( DSE )  based on \nKalman filter ( KF )  is used for the joint estimation of state \nvariables and parameters arising in the hot - spot thermal mod ‐\nel of power transformers ,  as defined in the IEC 60076 - 7 -\n2018  [ 7 ].  The KF - based DSE has been used in a remarkable \nnumber of studies for state estimation in power systems [ 8 ],  \n[ 9 ].  Regarding parameter estimation ,  two types of implemen ‐\ntations can be distinguished ,  namely :  a joint state and param ‐\neter estimation [ 10 ] - [ 12 ],  and a dual estimation where two \ndifferent estimators are sequentially applied at each time in ‐\nstant [ 13 ].  A particular formulation of the KF for nonlinear \nsystems ,  the so - called unscented KF ( UKF ),  is considered in \nthis paper for a joint estimation of the state and parameters .  \nThis estimation technique has been widely used in the stud ‐\nies related to electric power systems [ 14 ] - [ 16 ],  and its results \nhave been proven accurate when applied to strongly nonlin ‐\near systems such as the fully - regulated synchronous genera ‐\ntor [ 17 ].\nA preliminary academic work [ 18 ]  has concluded that it is \nimpossible to estimate the whole set of parameters arising in \nthe hot - spot thermal model solely from oil temperature mea ‐\nsurements .  To overcome this issue ,  this paper proposes a \ntwo - stage estimation technique ,  which considers measure ‐\nments of the hot - spot temperature taken under different load ‐\ning conditions ,  increasing in this way the number of observ ‐\nable parameters .\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows .

Finally ,  the conclu ‐\nsions are presented in Section VI .\nII .  UKF A LGORITHM  \nKF implementations require a set of state equations ,  in ‐\ncluding the dynamic and the measurement equations .  In the \ncase of continuous - time ,  discrete - measurement non - linear \nsystems ,  these equations can be expressed as :\nx ̇ ( t ) = f ( x ( t )  u ( t ) ) + w ( t ) ( 1 )\nz ( t\nk\n) = g ( x ( t\nk\n)  u ( t\nk\n) ) + v ( t\nk\n) ( 2 )\nwhere x ( t )  is the state vector ;  f ( × )  is the state function ;  g ( × )  is \nthe measurement function ;  u ( t )  is the system input ;  z ( t\nk\n)  is \nthe measurement vector at instant t\nk\n;  and w ( t )  and v ( t\nk\n)  are \nthe model and measurement noises ,  which are assumed \nGaussian processes with covariance matrices Q  and R ,  re ‐\nspectively .\nConsidering a time step D t ,  the above equations have the \nfollowing discrete counterparts :\nx\nk\n= x\nk - 1\n+ f ( x\nk - 1\n u\nk - 1\n) D t + w\nk ( 3 )\nz\nk\n= g ( x\nk\n u\nk\n) + v\nk ( 4 )\nEquations ( 3 )  and ( 4 )  are more appropriate for non - linear \nKalman filtering techniques such as extended KF ( EKF ),  \nwhich simply linearizes the state function f ( x ( t )  u ( t ) )  in ( 3 ),  \nand the UKF .\nPrevious experiences on the application of the EKF to the \nequations that describe the dynamic behavior of synchronous \nmachines ,  and their regulators ,  have not provided satisfacto ‐\nry results [ 17 ].  Therefore ,  this paper makes use of the UKF ,  \nwhose implementation is based on an iterative process with \ntwo different stages [ 19 ].\nA .

Parameter Estimation\nState estimation requires the previous knowledge of the \nparameters involved in the dynamic model .  However ,  when \nthese parameters are not known ,  estimation techniques such \nas UKF can be used for a joint estimation of state variables \nand parameters [ 20 ].  In this way ,  an augmented state vector \nx\nT\na\n= [ x\nT\n ψ\nT\n]  is adopted ,  where x  contains the state variables \nand ψ  includes the model parameters to be identified .  Then ,  \nthe dynamic model ( 3 )  and ( 4 )  is replaced by the following \naugmented equations .\né\në\nê\nêê\nê ù\nû\nú\núú\nú\nx\nk\nψ\nk\n=\né\në\nê\nêê\nê ù\nû\nú\núú\nú\nx\nk - 1\n+ f ( x\nk - 1\n ψ\nk - 1\n u\nk - 1\n) D t\nψ\nk - 1\n+ w\nk\n( 18 )\nz\nk\n= g ( x\na k\n u\nk\n) + v\nk ( 19 )\nwhere w\nk\n is now the augmented - model noise vector includ ‐\ning the state variable components ,  and the parameter compo ‐\nnents .\nIII .  M ODELING  OF  H OT - SPOT  D YNAMIC  T HERMAL  M ODEL  \nOF  P OWER  T RANSFORMERS  \nAs stated above ,  the evolution of the thermal state of a \npower transformer can be characterized in many ways ,  de ‐\npending on the required accuracy ,  transformer size ,  available \nsensors ,  and cooling system .  For oil - immersed power trans ‐\nformers ,  the IEC 60076 - 7 - 2018  standard [ 7 ]  considers a sim ‐\nple thermal model ,  based on a single worst - case temperature \n( so - called hot - spot temperature ),  aimed at capturing the im ‐\npact on transformer life of operation under different ambient \ntemperatures and load conditions .  This hot - spot model is \ndeemed sufficiently accurate to characterize the operating \ntemperatures that impact the transformer thermal aging .  \nTherefore ,  it can be useful to improve the operation and con ‐\ntrol of this important asset ,  as well as in the planning stages \nto define its thermal rating .\nIn this section ,  the standard hot - spot model ,  used as the \nreference model for simulation purposes ,  is first described .  \nThen ,  a more compact simplified model that involves a sub ‐\nset of observable parameters is also presented and discussed .  \nThis will be the model actually considered by the KF - based \nparameter estimator .\nA .  Full Hot-spot Model\nThe dynamic equations adopted in the reference model ,  \ni . e .,  the model used in the case study below to simulate \nnoisy measurements ,  are directly taken from [ 7 ].\nFirst ,  the evolution of the top - oil temperature θ\no\n is charac ‐\nterized through the following expression :\nθ ̇\no\n=\n1\nk\n1 1\nτ\no\né\në\nê\nêê\nê\nê\nê\n(\n1 + K\n2\nR\n1 + R )\nx\nD θ\no r\n- ( θ\no\n- θ\na\n)\nù\nû\nú\núú\nú\nú\nú\n( 20 )\nwhere θ\na\n is the ambient temperature ;  K  is the transformer \nload factor ,  which is defined as the quotient between the cur ‐\nrent through the transformer and the rated one ;  D θ\no r\n is the \noil temperature rise under rated - load conditions ;  k\n1 1\n is a con ‐\nstant of the thermal model ;  τ\no\n is the oil time constant ;  x  is \nthe total loss exponent ;  and R  is the ratio between rated - load \nand no - load losses .  The hot - spot temperature is related to the \ntop - oil temperature through two intermediate state variables \nD θ\nh 1\n and D θ\nh 2\n with different dynamics ,  which are described \nas :\nD θ ̇\nh 1\n=\n1\nk\n2 2\nτ\nw\n( k\n2 1\nK\ny\nD θ\nh r\n- D θ\nh 1\n) ( 21 )\nD θ ̇\nh 2\n=\nk\n2 2\nτ\no\n[ ( k\n2 1\n- 1 ) K\ny\nD θ\nh r\n- D θ\nh 2\n] ( 22 )\nwhere k\n2 1\n and k\n2 2\n are the constants of the thermal model ;  τ\nw\n \nis the winding time constant ;  y  is the current exponent ;  and \nD θ\nh r\n is the hot - spot temperature rise under rated load condi ‐\ntions .\nFinally ,  the hot - spot temperature θ\nh\n can be calculated as :\nθ\nh\n= θ\no\n+ D θ\nh 1\n- D θ\nh 2\n( 23 )\nThis hot - spot temperature is located towards the top of the \ntransformer winding ,  given that the degradation of the solid \ninsulation with high temperatures is typically taken as the \nmain aging factor .\nB .  Simplified Estimation Model\nThe whole set of parameters involved in ( 20 ) - ( 22 )  is not \nobservable when the temperature measurements discussed in \nSection IV ( oil and hot - spot temperatures )  are regularly cap ‐\ntured during the transformer operation .  Therefore ,  in order to \nobtain the values of those parameters ,  more sophisticated \nmethods should be considered ,  involving specific tests for \nthe thermal properties of the cooling system [ 21 ].\nIn this case ,  the lack of observability of some model pa ‐\nrameters is caused by the unique way in which those parame ‐\nters appear in the hot - spot model equations ,  which prevents \ntheir values to be estimated separately .  In particular ,  the four \nparameters k\n1 1\n,  k\n2 2\n,  τ\no\n,  and τ\nw\n,  involved in ( 20 ) - ( 22 ),  appear \ncombined in only three different ways ( k\n1 1\nτ\n0\n,  k\n2 2\nτ\nw\n,  and \nk\n2 2\n/ τ\no\n),  so they cannot be estimated independently .\nTo overcome the observability problem ,  the alternative ex ‐\nplored in this paper consists of algebraically rearranging the \noriginal full model ,  by introducing a smaller number of \nequivalent parameters ,  which leads to a more compact and \nmore linear ,  yet accurate dynamic model to be handled by \nthe KF - based parameter estimator .  The goal is to transform \nthe original nonlinear model ( 20 ) - ( 22 )  into the following dy ‐\nnamic model :\nθ ̇\no\n=\n1\nT\no\n[ A D θ\no r\n- ( θ\no\n- θ\na\n) ] ( 24 )\nD θ ̇\nh 1\n=\n1\nT\n1\n( C\n1\nB - D θ\nh 1\n) ( 25 )\nD θ ̇\nh 2\n=\n1\nT\n2\n( C\n2\nB - D θ\nh 2\n) ( 26 )\nwhere  in addition to the original parameter D θ\no r\n,  five modified \nparameters T\no\n,  T\n1\n,  T\n2\n,  C\n1\n,  C\n2\n and two auxiliary parameters A  \nand B  are introduced ,  which are related to those in the full hot -\nspot model as follows :  T\no\n= k\n1 1\nτ\no\n;  T\n1\n= k\n2 2\nτ\nw\n;  T\n2\n= τ\no\n/ k\n2 2\n;  C\n1\n=\nk\n2 1\nD θ\nh r\n;  C\n2\n= ( k\n2 1\n- 1 ) D θ\nh r\n;  A = [ ( 1 + K\n2\nR ) ( 1 + R ) ]\nx\n;  and B = K\ny\n.\nThe following remarks are made :\n1 )  The three time constants T\no\n,  T\n1\n,  and T\n2\n embed four pa ‐\nrameters k\n1 1\n,  k\n2 2\n,  τ\no\n,  and τ\nw\n.  So ,  the compact model ,  besides \n636\nGONZÁLEZ-CAGIGAL et al .:  PARAMETER ESTIMATION FOR HOT-SPOT THERMAL MODEL OF POWER TRANSFORMERS USING   \nbeing more linear ,  gets rid of a parameter without losing any \naccuracy ,  as there is no need in practice to determine individ ‐\nually the four parameters embedded in those time constants .\n2 )  The constants C\n1\n and C\n2\n,  once estimated ,  allow comput ‐\ning the two parameters k\n2 1\n and D θ\nh r\n.  So ,  the advantage of us ‐\ning C\n1\n and C\n2\n has to do with the enhanced linearity of the \nresulting model ( products are avoided ).\n3 )  As can be noticed ,  the values of the auxiliary parame ‐\nters A  and B  depend on the operating point of the power \ntransformer .  The technique proposed in this paper estimates \nthe transformed parameters considering different load factors \n( K )  and then letting the transformer reach the steady - state \nthermal conditions for each value of K .  This provides differ ‐\nent estimations of A  and B ,  which are in turn used to com ‐\npute estimates of the original parameters R ,  x ,  and y .  From \nthe defining expressions of the auxiliary parameters ,  it can \nbe concluded that at least two estimations of A  are required \nto obtain the original parameters R  and x ,  while a single val ‐\nue of B  would suffice to calculate y .\nIn a nutshell ,  if the reduced set of parameters involved in \nthe model ( 24 ) - ( 26 )  can be estimated ( including at least two \nestimations of A ),  the dynamics of the hot - spot temperature \ncan be fully characterized according to the standard defini ‐\ntion ,  but rather using the alternative set of parameters D θ\no r\n,  \nT\no\n,  T\n1\n,  T\n2\n,  C\n1\n,  C\n2\n,  R ,  x ,  and y ,  proposed in this paper .  Re ‐\ngarding the original parameters involved in the hot - spot mod ‐\nel ,  D θ\no r\n is directly obtained in the estimation process ,  while \nk\n2 1\n and D θ\nh r\n can be computed using the estimated values of \nthe modified parameters C\n1\n and C\n2\n.  Finally ,  as mentioned be ‐\nfore ,  R ,  x ,  and y  are obtained using estimates of A  and B .\nIV .  I MPLEMENTATION  OF  UKF \nEarly attempts to implement the KF - based estimation ,  in ‐\ncluding the whole set of modified parameters in the model ,  \nled to convergence problems .  To overcome this issue ,  a two -\nstage estimation technique is proposed in this paper .\nA .  The First Stage :  Full-load Conditions\nAt this stage ,  the transformer is assumed to serve the rat ‐\ned load ( K = 1 ),  starting from no - load conditions ( K = 0 )  or \nany other intermediate value .  In this situation ,  both parame ‐\nters A  and B  are equal to 1 ,  regardless the values of x ,  y ,  \nand R .  Therefore ,  ( 24 ) - ( 26 )  can be rewritten as :\nθ ̇\no\n=\n1\nT\no\n[ D θ\no r\n- ( θ\no\n- θ\na\n) ] ( 27 )\nḊ θ\nh 1\n=\n1\nT\n1\n( C\n1\n- D θ\nh 1\n) ( 28 )\nḊ θ\nh 2\n=\n1\nT\n2\n( C\n2\n- D θ\nh 2\n) ( 29 )\nIn this case ,  the state vector is defined as :\nx\nT\n= [ θ\no\nD θ\nh 1\nD θ\nh 2\n] ( 30 )\nWhile the parameter vector ψ  reduces to ( 31 ),  leading to a \ntotal vector size L = 9  ( rather than 11 ).\nψ\nT\n= [ T\n1\nT\n2\nC\n1\nC\n2\nD θ\no r\nT\no\n] ( 31 )\nFour magnitudes are assumed to be measured or known ,  \nnamely :  K ,  θ\na\n,  θ\no\n,  and θ\nh\n.  In the proposed formulation ,  these \nmagnitudes are divided into inputs u = [ K  θ\na\n]  and measure ‐\nments z = [ θ\no\n θ\nh\n]  [ 22 ].  The input K  ( load factor )  is derived \nfrom the current through the transformer ,  which causes the \nheating in the oil and windings .\nThe vector z  needs to be formulated in terms of the aug ‐\nmented state and input vectors ,  as in ( 19 ).  The first compo ‐\nnent of z ,  i . e .,  the oil temperature θ\no\n,  is a trivial case ,  since \nit is directly a state variable .  For the hot - spot temperature θ\nh\n,  \n( 23 )  is used .\nB .  The Second Stage :  Intermediate Loads\nThe goal of the second stage is to estimate the parameters \nA  and B .  For this purpose ,  two intermediate loading points ,  \nK\n1\n and K\n2\n,  with K\n1\n> 0  and K\n2\n< 1  are enforced ,  both under \nsteady - state conditions .  This provides two different estima ‐\ntions of the synthetic parameters A  and B ,  from which the \noriginal parameters R ,  x ,  and y  can be calculated .  Both state \ntransitions can start from K = 0  or any other intermediate val ‐\nue ,  as shown in the case study .\nIn this case ,  the parameter vector ψ  contains only A  and \nB ,  as the remaining modified parameters can be set to be \ntheir values estimated at the first stage .  The state vector x  is \nthe same as at the first stage ,  yielding a size L = 5  for the \naugmented state vector x\na\n at the second stage .  Similar con ‐\nsiderations as at the first stage can be made regarding the \nmeasurements used in the UKF implementation .\nV .  C ASE  S TUDY  \nIn this section ,  the proposed parameter estimation tech ‐\nnique is tested using synthetic measurements obtained from \nthe full hot - spot model presented in Section III ,  where the \nmodel parameters are assumed to be perfectly known .  In ‐\ndeed ,  it is only in simulation environments that estimation er ‐\nrors can be thoroughly evaluated .  Note that the rated power \nand voltage of the transformer are irrelevant for our purpos ‐\nes ,  as the transformer load factor K  is in per unit and the \nphysical characteristics of the apparatus are reflected in the \nparameters defining the hot - spot thermal model .  In any case ,  \nthis paper is mainly focused on three - phase distribution trans ‐\nformers .\nA .  In-house Estimation of Hot-spot Dynamic Model\nIt is assumed that the manufacturer performs the required \nfactory tests ( the two stages described before )  on a represen ‐\ntative transformer ,  in order to duly characterize the whole se ‐\nries of transformers of the same rated power and voltage ,  \nmanufactured with the same materials .  Those tests involve \noil and hot - spot temperature measurements .  For the simula ‐\ntions ,  the ambient temperature is assumed to evolve as in \nFig .  1  [ 23 ].  The time step considered in this work is D t = 1  \nmin .\nThe parameter values considered for the simulation are \ntaken from the IEC 60076 - 7 - 2018  standard ( for distribution \ntransformers up to 2500  kV A of rated power ),  which are \nsummarized in Table I .  However ,  the proposed technique is \nsuitable for other rated power ranges .\n637\nJOURNAL OF MODERN POWER SYSTEMS AND CLEAN ENERGY ,  VOL .  11 ,  NO .  2 ,  March 2023\nStarting from no - load conditions ( K = 0 ),  the transformer \nis sequentially subjected to three identical load steps ,  each \nequal to 1 / 3  of the rated load .  The load factor profile ,  along \nwith the evolution of the oil and hot - spot temperatures ,  is \nshown in Fig .  2 ,  where 2 %  error has been artificially added \nto the measurements .  Since the largest time constant in the \nsimulated system is in the order of 3  hours ,  the simulation \ntime is set to be 9  hours for each load step ( K = 1 / 3 ,  K = 2 / 3 ,  \nand K = 1 ),  i . e .,  three times the time constant ,  so as to make \nsure that steady - state conditions are reached for each loading \npoint .\nAs noted in the figure ,  the information corresponding to \nthe transition from K = 2 / 3  to K = 1  will be used for the first \nstage of the proposed technique ,  while the measurements \nfrom the first two load steps will be used for the second \nstage .\nThe UKF algorithm has been implemented with α = 1 0\n- 4\n,  \nκ = 0 ,  and β = 2  according to [ 24 ],  where the influence of \nthese scaling parameters is analyzed ,  while typical values are \nconsidered for the covariance matrices P\n0\n,  Q ,  and R .  The val ‐\nues of the modified parameters are initialized randomly ,  in a \nrange between ± 2 0 %  and ± 4 0 %  of their simulated values .\nThe proposed two - stage estimation technique presents a \nconsistent performance in its ability to properly estimate the \nmodified model parameters .  Figure 3  shows the estimation \nresults obtained from the first stage of the proposed tech ‐\nnique .  The evolution of the estimation error covariance is al ‐\nso included in this figure .  For each parameter i ,  its estimated \nvalue is represented along with a three - σ  band ± 3 P\ni i\n ( gray \nareas ).  The resulting relative errors are summarized in Table \nII ,  from which it is concluded that the maximum relative er ‐\nror remains under 3 % .\nTABLE I\nP ARAMETER  V ALUES  FOR  S IMULATION\nParameter\nD θ\no r\nk\n1 1\nτ\no\nR\nx\nSimulation value\n55  ℃\n1  p . u .\n180  min\n5  p . u .\n0 . 8  p . u .\nParameter\nD θ\nh r\nk\n2 2\nk\n2 1\nτ\nw\ny\nSimulation value\n23  ℃\n2  p . u .\n1 . 5  p . u .\n4  min\n1 . 6  p . u .\n0 12 15 18 21 24 27\nTime (hour)\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n3 6 9\nθa (℃)\nFig .  1 . 　 Considered profile for ambient temperature .\n0 12 15 18 21 24 27\nTime (hour)\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n0\n1\nOil temperature\nHot-spot temperature\nLoad factor\nData for the\n first stage\nData for the second stage\nTemperature (℃)\n3 6 9\nLoad factor (p.u.)3\n1\n3\n2\nFig .  2 . 　 Evolution of load factor and noisy measurements .\n0\n5\n10\n15T1 (min)\n100\n200\n300\n400T2 (min)\n30\n20\n40 C1 (℃)\n0\n10\n20C2 (℃)\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70Δθor (℃)\n100\n200\n300To (min)\n0 60 120 180 240 300 360 420 480 540\nTime (min)\nxi;^ xi±3σ;^ Simulated\nFig .  3 . 　 Estimation results obtained from the first stage of proposed tech ‐\nnique .\nTABLE II\nR ELATIVE  E RROR  IN  P ARAMETER  E STIMATION  AT  THE  F IRST  S TAGE\nValue\nSimulated\nEstimated\nRelative \nerror ( % )\nT\n1\n ( min )\n8 . 000\n8 . 004\n0 . 046\nT\n2\n ( min )\n180 . 000\n174 . 463\n2 . 985\nC\n1\n ( ℃ )\n34 . 500\n34 . 873\n1 . 082\nC\n2\n ( ℃ )\n11 . 500\n11 . 612\n0 . 977\nD θ\no r\n ( ℃ )\n55 . 000\n54 . 528\n0 . 858\nT\no\n ( min )\n180 . 000\n180 . 432\n0 . 240\n638\nGONZÁLEZ-CAGIGAL et al .:  PARAMETER ESTIMATION FOR HOT-SPOT THERMAL MODEL OF POWER TRANSFORMERS USING   \nAt the second stage ,  the value of the load is suddenly \nchanged ,  first from K = 0  to K = 1 / 3  and then ,  at t = 5 4 0  min ,  \nfrom K = 1 / 3  to K = 2 / 3 .  The total simulation time is 1080  \nmin in this case .  Only the parameters A  and B  are included \nin the vector ψ ,  while the remaining modified parameters are \ngiven their values estimated at the first stage .  Regarding the \nKF tuning ( initial values for x ̂\na 0\n and the matrices P\n0\n,  Q ,  and \nR ),  the similar assumptions to those at the first stage are \nmade .\nThe estimation results obtained from the auxiliary parame ‐\nters A  and B  at the second stage are shown in Fig .  4 ,  where \nthe deviations x ̂\ni\n± 3 P\ni i\n are also highlighted by the gray ar ‐\neas .\nWith the estimated values for K = 1 / 3  and K = 2 / 3 ,  the orig ‐\ninal parameters R ,  x ,  and y  can be calculated using a solver ,  \nyielding the estimated values and the relative errors included \nin Table III .  In this paper ,  a MATLAB function is used for \nthe implementation of the solver .\nAs previously mentioned ,  two intermediate loads are theo ‐\nretically sufficient to estimate the modified parameters A  and \nB  at the second stage of the proposed technique .  In order to \ncheck the sensitivity of the results to the use of redundant \n( i . e .,  more than two )  load factors ,  an additional scenario is \nsimulated with four intermediate loads ( K = 0 . 2   0 . 4   0 . 6 ,  and \n0 . 8 ).  Then ,  the resulting estimates of A  and B  are introduced \nin a least - squares function from MATLAB ,  in order to ob ‐\ntain new estimations for the original parameters R ,  x ,  and y .  \nAs can be observed in Table IV ,  the resulting relative errors \nare similar to those presented in Table III for two intermedi ‐\nate loads .\nFinally ,  Table V summarizes the relative errors of the ob ‐\nservable original parameters in the hot - spot model which can \nbe obtained from the estimated values of the modified pa ‐\nrameters .\nIn order to assess the performance of the UKF with in ‐\ncreasing measurement noise ,  Table VI includes the maxi ‐\nmum relative error in the parameter estimation for different \nnoise levels .  As expected ,  the estimates deteriorate with high ‐\ner noise levels ,  but the maximum relative error still remains \nunder 8 %  even for an unrealistic 1 0 %  measurement error .\nB .  Comparison with EKF Formulation\nThe results obtained with the UKF formulation are com ‐\npared in this subsection with those provided by the EKF ,  \nwhich is a popular alternative for non - linear dynamic estima ‐\ntion based on the linearization of the model .  Although both \nKFs adopt the same simplified model presented in Section \nIII ,  the EKF requires the computation of Jacobian matrices \n( partial derivatives with respect to the variables in the aug ‐\nmented state vector ),  as provided in Appendix A .\nSimilar assumptions are made regarding the test condi ‐\ntions for the case study ,  with two stages in the estimation \nprocess and the same step changes in the load factor K .  \nFirst ,  Fig .  5  represents the comparison of the estimated val ‐\nue of C\n2\n.  In this figure ,  it is observed that the EKF presents \na remarkably higher estimation error compared with that of \nthe proposed technique using UKF .  The reason for this low ‐\ner accuracy of the EKF formulation relates to the strong non -\nlinearities arising in the estimation model .

Impact of Parameter Estimation Errors on Hot-spot Tem ‐\nperature Estimation\nOnce the parameters of the thermal model have been esti ‐\nmated with the proposed UKF - based technique ,  it is impor ‐\ntant to assess if the estimation errors of the hot - spot tempera ‐\nture are acceptable .  For this purpose ,  two separate simula ‐\ntions have been carried out .\n1 )  Simulation using the exact value of the model parame ‐\nters ,  the so - called exact model .\n2 )  Simulation considering the estimated values of the orig ‐\ninal and modified parameters presented in the previous sec ‐\ntion ( Tables II and III ),  namely the estimated model .\nIn both cases ,  the total simulation time is one week and \nthe system inputs ( ambient temperature and load factor )  are \nthe same ,  with a typical evolution for the ambient tempera ‐\nture ,  as shown in Fig .  1 ,  and a cyclic variation of the trans ‐\nformer load ,  as shown in Fig .  6  ( the daily load profile is \nbased on [ 7 ]).  Note that ,  unlike in the factory tests ,  no oil \nmeasurements are captured ( only the ambient temperature is \nused as input ).\nThe evolution results of the hot - spot temperatures for both \nmodels and the corresponding error are represented in Fig .  \n7 .  In light of this figure ,  the following remarks can be made .\n1 )  The maximum hot - spot temperature error is lower than \n4 ℃ ,  providing evidence of the accuracy of the estimated \nmodel .\n2 )  In most cases ,  the hot - spot temperature obtained with \nthe estimated model is higher than that with the exact model \n( safe side ).\n3 )  Interestingly ,  lower errors ( even negligible )  are ob ‐\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\nUKF\nEKF\nSimulated value\nC2 (℃)\n0 60 120 180 240 300 360 420 480 540\nTime (min)\nFig .  5 . 　 Comparison of estimated value of C\n2\n.\nTABLE VII\nC OMPARISON  OF  R ELATIVE  E RRORS  P ROVIDED  BY  UKF AND  EKF \nA LGORITHMS\nParameter\nT\n1\nT\n2\nC\n1\nC\n2\nD θ\no r\nT\no\nR\nx\ny\nRelative error ( % )\nEKF\n4 . 144\n20 . 585\n1 . 013\n7 . 690\n0 . 817\n1 . 468\n1 . 014\n1 . 120\n0 . 534\nUKF\n0 . 046\n2 . 985\n1 . 082\n0 . 977\n0 . 858\n0 . 240\n0 . 602\n0 . 247\n0 . 155\n0 24 48 72 96 120 144 168\nTime (hour)\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0Load factor (p\u000fu.)\nFig .  6 . 　 Load profile for one-week simulation .\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100 Exact model; Estimated model\n0 24 48 72 96 120 144 168\nTime (hour)\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4Error (℃) Hot-spot temperature (℃)\nFig .  7 . 　 Evolution results of hot-spot temperatures and corresponding error .\n640\nGONZÁLEZ-CAGIGAL et al .:  PARAMETER ESTIMATION FOR HOT-SPOT THERMAL MODEL OF POWER TRANSFORMERS USING   \ntained when the transformer load is high and the hot - spot \ntemperatures reach the highest values .  Reciprocally ,  the peri ‐\nods of higher estimation errors correspond to the reduced \nvalues of the hot - spot temperature ,  when the integrity of the \ntransformer is not jeopardized .\nVI .  C ONCLUSION  \nIn this paper ,  an UKF is developed ,  implemented ,  and test ‐\ned to estimate the state variables and parameters of the hot -\nspot dynamic thermal model of a power transformer .  The \nnon - observability of the parameters involved in the original \nthermal model is circumvented by introducing a reduced but \nequivalent set of modified parameters .\nAdditionally ,  to overcome the convergence problems aris ‐\ning when the whole set of parameters is simultaneously han ‐\ndled ,  a two - stage estimation technique is proposed ,  where \nrated load conditions are considered at the first stage in or ‐\nder to reduce the number of parameters to be identified .  The \nUKF technique requires three measurements from the power \ntransformer ( load factor ,  oil temperature ,  and hot - spot tem ‐\nperature ),  along with the ambient temperature ,  all of which \nare easily available during factory tests .\nA case study has been simulated ,  where the maximum rel ‐\native estimation error remains under 3 % .  It has also shown \nthat the estimation errors are not significantly affected by \nthe number of intermediate load factors adopted at the sec ‐\nond stage of the estimation process .  As expected ,  increasing \nlevels of measurement errors tend to deteriorate the perfor ‐\nmance of the UKF estimator ,  but even for unrealistically \nhigh error values ( 10 % ),  the maximum estimation error is ac ‐\nceptable in relative terms ( 7 . 5 % ).\nIn terms of convergence and accuracy ,  the proposed tech ‐\nnique performs significantly better than the EKF ,  which suf ‐\nfers from the non - linearity of the model when all parameters \nbecome unknown .\nFinally ,  the impact of the parameter estimation errors on \nthe accuracy of the hot - spot temperature evolution ,  during \nthe transformer field operation ,  has been assessed through a \nsimulation spanning a week ,  using as inputs only the load \nfactor and the ambient temperature .  The results obtained \nshow that the hot - spot temperature obtained with the estimat ‐\ned model is sufficiently close to that of the exact model ,  \nwith a maximum absolute error lower than 4  ℃ for reduced \nvalues of the load factor ,  and approximately 2  ℃ as the rat ‐\ned transformer load is approached .\nThe proposed technique can fill the existing gap in real - time \nthermal modeling of power transformers ,  by allowing manu ‐\nfacturers to perform straightforward in - house tes ts ,  where the \nload conditions can be controlled ,  which in turn will let their \ncustomers easily monitor the hot - spot temperature during the \nfield operation ,  based only on the actual load and ambient \ntemperature .\nA PPENDIX  A\nThe implementation of the EKF formulation also involves \ntwo stages of estimation ,  as those presented for the UKF .  \nFor the first stage ,  the discrete form of the model dynamic \nequations is as follows :\nθ\no  k\n= θ\no  k - 1\n+\nD t\nT\no  k - 1\n( D θ\no r  k - 1\n- θ\no  k - 1\n+ θ\na  k - 1\n) ( A 1 )\nD θ\nh 1  k\n= D θ\nh 1  k - 1\n+\nD t\nT\n1  k - 1\n( C\n1  k - 1\n- D θ\nh 1  k - 1\n) ( A 2 )\nD θ\nh 2  k\n= D θ\nh 2  k - 1\n+\nD t\nT\n2  k - 1\n( C\n2  k - 1\n- D θ\nh 2  k - 1\n) ( A 3 )\nT\n1  k\n= T\n1  k - 1\n( A 4 )\nT\n2  k\n= T\n2  k - 1\n( A 5 )\nC\n1  k\n= C\n1  k - 1\n( A 6 )\nC\n2  k\n= C\n2  k - 1\n( A 7 )\nT\no  k\n= T\no  k - 1\n( A 8 )\nD θ\no r  k\n= D θ\no r  k - 1\n( A 9 )\nThe EKF uses the Jacobian matrix of the state function at \ntime k ,  namely F\nk\n,  where each element of this matrix is de ‐\nfined as :\nF\ni  j\nk\n=\n¶ x\ni  k\n¶ x\nj  k - 1\n( A 10 )\nUsing the above definition ,  the partial derivatives of ( A 1 ) -\n( A 9 )  must be calculated ,  yielding the following expressions \nfor the non - null terms ,  where the correspondences with the \nelements of F\nk\n are indicated :\nF\n1  1\nk\n= 1 -\nD t\nT\no  k - 1\n( A 11 )\nF\n1  8\nk\n= -\nD t ( D θ\no r  k - 1\n- θ\no  k - 1\n+ θ\na  k - 1\n)\nT\n2\no  k - 1\n( A 12 )\nF\n1  9\nk\n=\nD t\nT\no  k - 1\n( A 13 )\nF\n2  2\nk\n= 1 -\nD t\nT\n1  k - 1\n( A 14 )\nF\n2  4\nk\n= -\nD t ( C\n1  k - 1\n- D θ\nh 1  k - 1\n)\nT\n2\n1  k - 1\n( A 15 )\nF\n2  6\nk\n=\nD t\nT\n1  k - 1\n( A 16 )\nF\n3  3\nk\n= 1 -\nD t\nT\n2  k - 1\n( A 17 )\nF\n3  5\nk\n= -\nD t ( C\n2  k - 1\n- D θ\nh 2  k - 1\n)\nT\n2\n2  k - 1\n( A 18 )\nF\n3  7\nk\n=\nD t\nT\n2  k - 1\n( A 19 )\nF\ni  i\nk\n= 1     i = 4  5  . . .  9 ( A 20 )\nNote that the measurement equation ( 23 )  is linear ,  so that \nits Jacobian matrix is trivial .
