Fine-tuning\nthe trained contextual models on task-speciﬁc\ndatasets has been the key to achieving supe-\nrior performance downstream.

Pre-trained models don’t have\nthe necessary components to accept two ex-\ntra modalities of vision and acoustic. In\nthis paper, we proposed an attachment to\nBERT and XLNet called Multimodal Adapta-\ntion Gate (MAG). MAG allows BERT and XL-\nNet to accept multimodal nonverbal data dur-\ning ﬁne-tuning. It does so by generating a\nshift to internal representation of BERT and\nXLNet; a shift that is conditioned on the vi-\nsual and acoustic modalities. In our experi-\nments, we study the commonly used CMU-\nMOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets for multi-\nmodal sentiment analysis. Fine-tuning MAG-\nBERT and MAG-XLNet signiﬁcantly boosts\nthe sentiment analysis performance over pre-\nvious baselines as well as language-only ﬁne-\ntuning of BERT and XLNet. On the CMU-\nMOSI dataset, MAG-XLNet achieves human-\nlevel multimodal sentiment analysis perfor-\nmance for the ﬁrst time in the NLP commu-\nnity. 1\n1 Introduction\nHuman face-to-face communication ﬂows as a\nseamless integration of language, acoustic, and vi-\nsion modalities. In ordinary everyday interactions,\n1This paper has been accepted in Association for Compu-\ntational Linguistics (ACL) 2020 conference\n* - Equal contribution\nwe utilize all these modalities jointly to convey our\nintentions and emotions. Understanding this face-\nto-face communication falls within an increasingly\ngrowing NLP research area called multimodal lan-\nguage analysis (Zadeh et al., 2018b). The biggest\nchallenge in this area is to efﬁciently model the\nthree pillars of communication together. This gives\nartiﬁcial intelligence systems the capability to com-\nprehend the multi-sensory information without dis-\nregarding nonverbal factors. In many applications\nsuch as dialogue systems and virtual reality, this\ncapability is crucial to maintain the high quality of\nuser interaction.\nThe recent success of contextual word rep-\nresentations in NLP is largely credited to new\nTransformer-based (Vaswani et al., 2017) models\nsuch as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and XLNet\n(Yang et al., 2019). These Transformer-based mod-\nels have shown performance improvement across\ndownstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2018). However,\ntheir true downstream potential comes from ﬁne-\ntuning their pre-trained models for particular tasks\n(Devlin et al., 2018). This is often done easily for\nlexical datasets which exhibit language modality\nonly. However, this ﬁne-tuning for multimodal\nlanguage is neither trivial nor yet studied; simply\nbecause both BERT and XLNet only expect lin-\nguistic input. Therefore, in applying BERT and\nXLNet to multimodal language, one must either\n(a) forfeit the nonverbal information and ﬁne-tune\nfor language, or (b) simply extract word represen-\ntations and proceed to use a state-of-the-art model\nfor multimodal studies.\nIn this paper, we present a successful framework\nfor ﬁne-tuning BERT and XLNet for multimodal\ninput. Our framework allows the BERT and XL-\nNet core structures to remain intact, and only at-\ntaches a carefully designed Multimodal Adaptation\nGate (MAG) to the models. Using an attention\nconditioned on the nonverbal behaviors, MAG es-\narXiv:1908.05787v3  [cs.LG]  21 Nov 2020\nsentially maps the informative visual and acoustic\nfactors to a vector with a trajectory and magnitude.\nDuring ﬁne-tuning, this adaptation vector modiﬁes\nthe internal state of the BERT and XLNet, allowing\nthe models to seamlessly adapt to the multimodal\ninput. In our experiments we use the CMU-MOSI\n(Zadeh et al., 2016) and CMU-MOSEI (Zadeh\net al., 2018d) datasets of multimodal language, with\na speciﬁc focus on the core NLP task of multimodal\nsentiment analysis. We compare the performance\nof MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet to the above (a)\nand (b) scenarios in both classiﬁcation and regres-\nsion sentiment analysis. Our ﬁndings demonstrate\nthat ﬁne-tuning these advanced pre-trained Trans-\nformers using MAG yields consistent improvement,\neven though BERT and XLNet were never trained\non multimodal data.\nThe contributions of this paper are therefore sum-\nmarized as:\n• We propose an efﬁcient framework for ﬁne-\ntuning BERT and XLNet for multimodal lan-\nguage data. This framework uses a component\ncalled Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG)\nthat introduces minimal overhead to both the\nmodels.\n• MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet set new state\nof the art in both CMU-MOSI and CMU-\nMOSEI datasets, when compared to scenarios\n(a) and (b). For CMU-MOSI, MAG-XLNet\nachieves performance on par with reported\nhuman performance.\n2 Related Works\nThe studies in this paper are related to the following\nresearch areas:\n2.1 Multimodal Language Analyses\nMultimodal language analyses is a recent research\ntrend in natural language processing (Zadeh et al.,\n2018b) that helps us understand language from\nthe modalities of text, vision and acoustic. These\nanalyses have particularly focused on the tasks of\nsentiment analysis (Poria et al., 2018), emotion\nrecognition (Zadeh et al., 2018d), and personality\ntraits recognition (Park et al., 2014). Works in\nthis area often focus on novel multimodal neural\narchitectures (Pham et al., 2019; Hazarika et al.,\n2018) and multimodal fusion approaches (Liang\net al., 2018; Tsai et al., 2018).\nRelated to content in this paper, we discuss\nsome of the models in this domain including TFN,\nMARN, MFN, RMFN and MulT. Tensor Fusion\nNetwork (TFN) (Zadeh et al., 2017) creates a\nmulti-dimensional tensor to explicitly capture all\npossible interactions between the three modali-\nties: unimodal, bimodal and trimodal. Multi-\nattention Recurrent Network (MARN) (Zadeh et al.,\n2018c) uses three separate hybrid LSTM memories\nthat have the ability to propagate the cross-modal\ninteractions. Memory Fusion Network (Zadeh\net al., 2018a) synchronizes the information from\nthree separate LSTMs through a multi-view gated\nmemory. Recurrent Memory Fusion Network\n(RMFN) (Liang et al., 2018) captures the nuanced\ninteractions among the modalities in a multi-stage\nmanner, giving each stage the ability to focus\non a subset of signals. Multimodal Transformer\nfor Unaligned Multimodal Language Sequences\n(MulT) (Tsai et al., 2019) deploys three Transform-\ners – each for one modality – to capture the in-\nteractions with the other two modalities in a self-\nattentive manner. The information from the three\nTransformers are aggregated through late-fusion.\n2.2 Pre-trained Language Representations\nLearning word representations from large cor-\npora has been an active research area in NLP\ncommunity (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington\net al., 2014). Glove (Pennington et al., 2014) and\nWord2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) contributed to\nadvancing the state-of-the-art of many NLP tasks.\nA major setback of these word representations is\ntheir non-contextual nature. Recently, contextual\nlanguage representation models trained on large\ntext corpora have achieved state of the art results\non several NLP tasks including question answer-\ning, sentiment classiﬁcation, part-of-speech (POS)\ntagging and similarity modeling(Peters et al., 2018;\nDevlin et al., 2018). The ﬁrst two notable con-\ntextual representation based models were ELMO\n(Peters et al., 2018) and GPT (Radford et al., 2018).\nHowever, they only captured unidirectional context\nand therefore, missed more nuanced interactions\namong words of a sentence. BERT (Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations from Transformers) (De-\nvlin et al., 2018) outperforms both ELMO and GPT\nsince it can provide better representation through\ncapturing bi-directional context using Transform-\ners. XLNet(Dai et al., 2019) gives new contextual\nrepresentations through building an auto-regressive\nmodel capable of capturing all possible factoriza-\ntions of the input. Fine-tuning pretrained mod-\nels for BERT and XLNet has been a key factor in\nachieving state of the art performance for down-\nstream tasks. Even though previous works have\nexplored using BERT to model multimodal data\n(Sun et al., 2019), to the best of our knowledge, di-\nrectly ﬁne-tuning BERT or XLNet for multimodal\ndata has not been explored in previous works.\n3 BERT and XLNet\nTo better understand the proposed multimodal\nframework in this paper, we ﬁrst present an\noverview of both the BERT and XLNet models.\nWe start by quickly formalizing the operations\nwithin Transformer and Transformer-XL models,\nfollowed by an overview of BERT and XLNet.\n3.1 Transformer\nTransformer is a non-recurrent neural architecture\ndesigned for modeling sequential data (Vaswani\net al., 2017). The superior performance of Trans-\nformer model is largely credited to a Multi-head\nSelf-Attention module. Using this module, each el-\nement of a sequence is attended by conditioning on\nall the other sequence elements. Figure 2 summa-\nrizes internal operations of a Transformer layer (for\nM such layers). Commonly, a Transformer uses\nan encoder-decoder paradigm. A stack of encoders\nis followed by a stack of decoders to map an input\nsequence to an output sequence. An additional em-\nbedding step with Positional Input Embedding is\napplied before the input goes through the stack of\nencoders and decoders.\n3.2 Transformer-XL\nTransformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) is an extension\nof the Transformer which offers two improvements:\na) it enhances the capability of the Transformer\nto capture long-range dependencies (speciﬁcally\nfor the case of context fragmentation), and b) it\nimproves the capability to better predict ﬁrst few\nsymbols (which are often crucial for the rest of the\nsequence). It does so with a recurrence mechanism\ndesigned to pass context information from one seg-\nment to the next and a relative positional encoding\nmechanism to enable state reuse without causing\ntemporal confusion.\n3.3 BERT\nBERT is a successful language model that pro-\nvides rich contextual word representation (Devlin\net al., 2018). It follows an auto-encoding approach\n– masking out a portion of input tokens and pre-\ndicting those tokens based on all other non-masked\ntokens – and thus learning a vector representation\nfor the masked out tokens in that process. We\nuse the variant of BERT used for Single Sentence\nClassiﬁcation Tasks. First, input embeddings are\ngenerated from a sequence of word-piece tokens\nby adding token embeddings, segment embeddings\nand position embeddings . Then multiple Encoder\nlayers are applied on top of these input embeddings.\nEach Encoder has a Multi-Head Attention layer and\na Feed Forward layer, each followed by a residual\nconnection with layer normalization. A special\n[CLS] token is appended in front of the input token\nsequence. So, for a N length input sequence, we\nget N+1 vectors from the last Encoder layer – the\nﬁrst of those vectors is used to predict the label\nof the input after that vector undergoes an afﬁne\ntransformation.\n3.4 XLNet\nXLNet (Yang et al., 2019) sets out to improve two\ncritical aspects of the BERT model: a) indepen-\ndence among the masked out tokens and b) pretrain-\nﬁnetune discrepancy in training vs inference, since\ninference inputs do not have masked out tokens.\nXLNet is an auto-regressive model and therefore,\nis free from the need of masking out certain tokens.\nHowever, auto-regressive models usually capture\nthe unidirectional context (either forward or back-\nward). XLNet can learn bidirectional context by\nmaximizing likelihood over all possible permuta-\ntions of factorization order. In essence, it randomly\nsamples multiple factorization orders and trains the\nmodel on each of those orders. Therefore, it can\nmodel input by taking all possible permutations\ninto consideration (in expectation).\nXLNet utilizes two key ideas from Transformer-\nXL (Dai et al., 2019): relative positioning and seg-\nment recurrence mechanism. Like BERT, it also\nhas a Input Embedder followed by multiple En-\ncoders. The Embedder converts the input tokens\ninto vectors after adding token embedding, segment\nembedding and relative positional embedding in-\nformation. Each encoder consists of a Multi-Head\nattention layer and a feed forward layer – each\nfollowed by a residual addition and normalization\nlayer. The embedder output is fed into the encoders\nto get a contextual representation of input.\nAttentionGating\nShifting\nLexicalInputAcoustic InputVisual Input𝑍\" 𝐴\" 𝑉\"\n𝐻\"\n&𝑍\"\nFigure 1: Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG) takes\nas input a lexical input vector, as well as its visual and\nacoustic accompaniments. Subsequently, an attention\nover lexical and nonverbal dimensions is used to fuse\nthe multimodal data into another vector, which is sub-\nsequently added to the input lexical vector (shifting).\n4 Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG)\nIn multimodal language, a lexical input is accom-\npanied by visual and acoustic information - simply\ngestures and prosody co-occurring with language.\nConsider a semantic space that captures latent con-\ncepts (positions in the latent space) for individual\nwords. In absence of multimodal accompaniments,\nthe semantic space is directly conditioned on the\nlanguage manifold. Simply put, each word falls\nwithin some part of this semantic space, depending\nonly on the meaning of the word in a linguistic\nstructure (i.e. sentence). Nonverbal behaviors can\nhave an impact on the meaning of words, and there-\nfore on the position of words in this semantic space.\nTogether, language and nonverbal accompaniments\ndecide on the new position of the word in the se-\nmantic space. In this paper, we regard to this new\nposition as addition of the language-only position\nwith a displacement vector; a vector with trajec-\ntory and magnitude that shifts the language-only\nposition of the word to the new position in light of\nnonverbal behaviors. This is the core philosophy\nbehind the Multimodal Adaptation Gate (MAG).\nA particularly appealing implementation of such\ndisplacement is studied in RA VEN (Wang et al.,\n2018), where displacements are calculated using\ncross-modal self-attention to highlight relevant non-\nverbal information. Figure 1 shows the studied\nMAG in this paper. Essentially, a MAG unit re-\nceives three inputs, one is purely lexical, one is\nvisual, and the last one is acoustic. Let the triplet\n(Zi,Ai,Vi) denote these inputs for ith word in a\nsequence. We break this displacement into bimodal\nfactors [Zi; Ai]and [Zi; Vi]by concatenating lex-\nical vector with acoustic and visual information\nrespectively and use them to produce two gating\nvectors gv\ni and ga\ni :\ngv\ni =R(Wgv[Zi; Vi]+bv) (1)\nga\ni =R(Wga[Zi; Ai]+ba) (2)\nwhere Wgv, Wga are weight matrices for visual and\nacoustic modality and bv and ba are scalar biases.\nR(x) is a non-linear activation function. These\ngates highlight the relevant information in visual\nand acoustic modality conditioned on the lexical\nvector.\nWe then create a non-verbal displacement vector\nHi by fusing together Ai and Vi multiplied by their\nrespective gating vectors:\nHi =ga\ni ⋅(WaAi) +gv\ni ⋅(WvVi) +bH (3)\nwhere Wa and Wv are weight matrices for acoustic\nand visual information respectively and bH is the\nbias vector.\nSubsequently, we use a weighted summation be-\ntween Zi and its nonverbal displacement Hi to cre-\nate a multimodal vector ¯Zi:\n¯Zi =Zi +αHi (4)\nα=min( /parallel.alt1Zi/parallel.alt12\n/parallel.alt1Hi/parallel.alt12\nβ,1) (5)\nwhere βis a hyper-parameter selected through the\ncross-validation process. /parallel.alt1Zi/parallel.alt12 and /parallel.alt1Hi/parallel.alt12 denote\nthe L2 norm of the Zi and Hi vectors respectively.\nWe use the scaling factorαso that the effect of non-\nverbal shift Hi remains within a desirable range.\nFinally, we apply a layer normalization and dropout\nlayer to ¯Zi.\nInput Embedder\n….𝐶𝐿𝑆\nMultimodalAdaptation Gate\nMulti-Head Attention\nFeed Forward\nAdd & Norm\nAdd & Norm\n𝐿1 𝐿2 𝐿𝑁\n….𝐸𝐶𝐿𝑆𝐸1 𝐸2 𝐸𝑁\n𝑍)*𝐴)𝑉)\nMultimodalAdaptation Gate\n𝑍-*𝐴-𝑉-\nMultimodalAdaptation Gate\n𝑍.*𝐴.𝑉.\nMulti-Head Attention\nFeed Forward\nAdd & Norm\nAdd & Norm\n(𝑀−𝑗)×\n𝑗×\n̅𝑍678* ̅𝑍)* ̅𝑍-* ̅𝑍.*\n̅𝑍6789 ̅𝑍)9 ̅𝑍-9 ̅𝑍.9\n….\nFigure 2: Best viewed zoomed in and in color. The\nTransformer architecture of BERT/XLNet with MAG\napplied at jth layer. We consider a total of M layers\nwithin the pretrained Transformer. MAG can be ap-\nplied at different layers of the pretrained Transformers.\n4.1 MAG-BERT\nMAG-BERT is a combination of MAG applied to\na certain layer of BERT network (Figure 2 demon-\nstrates the structure of MAG-BERT as well as\nMAG-XLNet). Essentially, at each layer, BERT\ncontains lexical vectors for ith word in the se-\nquence. For the same word, nonverbal accompa-\nniments are also available in multimodal language\nsetup. MAG essentially forms an attachment to the\ndesired layer in BERT; an attachment that allows\nfor multimodal information to leak into the BERT\nmodel and displace the lexical vectors. The oper-\nations within MAG allows for the lexical vectors\nwithin BERT to adapt to multimodal information\nby changing their positions within the semantic\nspace. Aside from the attachment of MAG, no\nchange is made to the BERT structure.\nGiven an N length language sequence L =\n[L1,L2,...L N ] carrying word-piece tokens, a\n[CLS] token is appended to L so that we can\nuse it later for class label prediction. Then,\nwe input L to the Input Embedder which out-\nputs E = [ECLS ,E1,E2,...E N ]after adding to-\nken, segment and position embeddings. Then,\nwe input E to the ﬁrst Encoding layer and\nthen apply j Encoders on it successively. After\nthat encoding process, we get the output Zj =\n[Zj\nCLS ,Zj\n1,Zj\n2,...Z j\nN ]which denotes the Lexical\nEmbeddings after jlayers of Encoding.\nFor injecting audio-visual information into these\nembeddings, we prepare a sequence of triplets\n[(Zj\ni ,Ai,Vi) ∶ ∀i ∈ {CLS,[1,N]}]by pairing\nZj\ni with the corresponding (Ai,Vi). Each of these\ntriplets are passed through the Multimodal Adap-\ntation Gatewhich transforms the ith triplet into\n¯Zj\ni – a uniﬁed multimodal representation of the\ncorresponding Lexical Embedding.\nAs there exists M = 12 Encoder layers in our\nBERT model, we input ¯Zj = [¯Zj\n1, ¯Zj\n2,... ¯Zj\nN ]to\nthe next Encoder and apply M−jEncoder layers\non it successively. At the end, we get ¯ZM from\nthe Mth Encoder layer. As the ﬁrst element ¯ZM\nCLS\nrepresents the [CLS] token, it has the information\nnecessary to make a class label prediction. There-\nfore, ¯ZM\nCLS goes through an afﬁne transformation\nto produce a single real-value which can be used to\npredict a class label.\n4.2 MAG-XLNet\nLike MAG-BERT, MAG-XLNet also has the capa-\nbility of injecting audio-visual information at any\nof its layers using MAG. At each position jof any\nof its layer, it holds the lexical vector corresponding\nto that position. Utilizing the audio-visual infor-\nmation available for that position, it can invoke\nMAG to get an appropriately shifted lexical vector\nin multimodal space. Although it mostly follows\nthe general paradigm presented in Figure 2 ver-\nbatim, it uses the XLNet speciﬁc Embedder and\nEncoders. One other key difference is the position\nof the [CLS] token. Unlike BERT, the [CLS] to-\nken is appended at the right end of the input token\nsequence, and therefore in all the intermediate rep-\nresentations, the vector corresponding to the [CLS]\nwill be the rightmost one. Following the same logic,\nthe output from the ﬁnal Encoding layer will be\n¯ZM = [¯ZM\n1 , ¯ZM\n2 ,... ¯ZM\nN , ¯ZM\nCLS ]. The last item,\n¯ZM\nCLS can be used for class label prediction after it\ngoes through an afﬁne transformation.\n5 Experiments\nIn this section we outline the experiments in this\npaper. We ﬁrst start by describing the datasets,\nfollowed by description of extracted features, base-\nlines, and experimental setup.\n5.1 CMU-MOSI Dataset\nCMU-MOSI (CMU Multimodal Opinion Senti-\nment Intensity) is a dataset of multimodal language\nspeciﬁcally focused on multimodal sentiment anal-\nysis (Zadeh et al., 2016). CMU-MOSI contains\n2199 video segments taken from 93 Youtube movie\nreview videos. The dataset has real-valued high-\nagreement sentiment intensity annotations in the\nrange [−3,+3].\n5.2 Computational Descriptors\nFor each modality, the following computational\ndescriptors are available:\nLanguage: We transcribe the videos using\nYoutube API followed by manual correction.\nAcoustic: COV AREP (Degottex et al., 2014) is\nused to extract the following relevant features:\nfundamental frequency, quasi open quotient, nor-\nmalized amplitude quotient, glottal source param-\neters (H1H2, Rd, Rd conf), VUV , MDQ, the\nﬁrst 3 formants, PSP, HMPDM 0-24 and HM-\nPDD 0-12, spectral tilt/slope of wavelet responses\n(peak/slope), MCEP 0-24.\nVisual: For the visual modality, the Facet library\n(iMotions, 2017) is used to extract a set of visual\nfeatures including facial action units, facial land-\nmarks, head pose, gaze tracking and HOG features.\nFor each word, we align all three modalities fol-\nlowing the convention established in (Chen et al.,\n2017). Firstly, the word alignment between lan-\nguage and audio is obtained using forced align-\nment (Yuan and Liberman, 2008). Afterwards, the\nboundary of each word denotes the co-occurring vi-\nsual and acoustic features (FACET and COV AREP).\nSubsequently, for each word, the co-occurring\nacoustic and visual features are averaged across\neach feature – thus achieving Ai and Vi vectors\ncorresponding to word i.\n5.3 Baseline Models\nWe compare the performance of MAG-BERT and\nMAG-XLNet to a variety of state-of-the-art models\nfor multimodal language analysis. These models\nare trained using extracted BERT and XLNet word\nembeddings as their language input:\nTFN (Tensor Fusion Network)explicitly mod-\nels both intra-modality and inter-modality dy-\nnamics (Zadeh et al., 2017) by creating a multi-\ndimensional tensor that captures unimodal, bi-\nmodal and trimodal interactions across three modal-\nities.\nMARN (Multi-attention Recurrent Network)\nmodels view-speciﬁc interactions using hybrid\nLSTM memories and cross-modal interactions us-\ning a Multi-Attention Block (MAB) (Zadeh et al.,\n2018c).\nMFN (Memory Fusion Network)has three sepa-\nrate LSTMs to model each modality separately and\na multi-view gated memory to synchronize among\nthem (Zadeh et al., 2018a).\nRMFN (Recurrent Memory Fusion Network)\ncaptures intra-modal and inter-modal information\nthrough recurrent multi-stage fashion (Liang et al.,\n2018).\nMulT (Multimodal Transformer for Unaligned\nMultimodal Language Sequence)uses three sets\nof Transformers and combines their output in a\nlate fusion manner to model a multimodal se-\nquence (Tsai et al., 2019). We use the aligned\nvariant of the originally proposed model, which\nachieves superior performance over the unaligned\nvariant.\nWe also compare our model to ﬁne-tuned BERT\nand XLNet using language modality only to mea-\nsure the success of the MAG framework.\n5.4 Experimental Design\nAll the models in this paper are trained using\nAdam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) optimizer with learn-\ning rates between {0.001,0.0001,0.00001}. We\nuse dropouts of {0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5}for train-\ning each model. LSTMs in TFN, MARN, MFN,\nRMFN, LFN use latent size of {16,32,64,128}.\nFor MulT, we use {3,5,7}layers in the network\nand {1,3,5}attention heads. All models use the\ndesignated validation set of CMU-MOSI for ﬁnd-\ning best hyper-parameters.\nWe perform two different evaluation tasks on\nCMU-MOSI datset: i) Binary Classiﬁcation, and\nii) Regression. We formulate it as a regression\nproblem and report Mean-absolute Error (MAE)\nand the correlation of model predictions with true\nlabels. Besides, we convert the regression outputs\ninto categorical values to obtain binary classiﬁca-\ntion accuracy (BA) and F1 score. Higher value\nmeans better performance for all the metrics except\nMAE. We use two evaluation metrics for BA and\nF1, one used in (Zadeh et al., 2018d) and one used\nin (Tsai et al., 2019).\n6 Results and Discussion\nTable 1 shows the results of the experiments in this\npaper. We summarize the observations from the\nresults in this table as following:\n6.1 Performance of MAG-BERT\nIn all the metrics across the CMU-MOSI dataset,\nwe observe that performance of MAG-BERT is su-\nperior to state-of-the-art multimodal models that\nuse BERT word embeddings. Furthermore, MAG-\nBERT also performs superior to ﬁne-tuned BERT.\nThis essentially shows that the MAG component is\nallowing the BERT model to adapt to multimodal\ninformation during ﬁne-tuning, thus achieving su-\nperior performance.\n6.2 Performance of MAG-XLNet\nA similar performance trend to MAG-BERT is\nalso observed for MAG-XLNet. Besides supe-\nrior performance than baselines and ﬁne-tuned\nXLNet, MAG-XLNet achieves near-human level\nperformance for CMU-MOSI dataset. Further-\nmore, we train MulT using the ﬁne-tuned XLNet\nembeddings and get the following performance:\n83.6/slash.left85.3,82.6/slash.left84.2,0.810,0.759 which is lower\nthan both MAG-XLNet and XLNet. It is notable\nthat the p-value for student t-test between MAG-\nXLNet and XLNet in Table 1 is lower than 10e−5\nfor all the metrics.\nThe motivation behind the experiments reported\nin Table 1 is as follows: we extracted word embed-\ndings from pre-trained BERT and XLNet models\nand trained the baseline models using those embed-\ndings. Since BERT and XLNet are often perceived\nto provide better word embeddings than Glove, it\nis not fair to compare MAG-BERT/MAG-XLNet\nwith previous models trained with Glove embed-\ndings. Therefore, we retrain previous works us-\nTask Metric BA ↑ F1↑ MAE↓ Corr↑\nOriginal (glove)\nTFN 73.9/– 73.4/– 0.970/– 0.633/–\nMARN 77.1/– 77.0/– 0.968/– 0.625/–\nMFN 77.4/– 77.3/– 0.965/– 0.632/–\nRMFN 78.4/– 78.0/– 0.922/– 0.681/–\nLFN 76.4/– 75.7/– 0.912/– 0.668/–\nMulT –/83.0 –/82.8 –/0.871 –/0.698\nBERT\nTFN 74.8/76.0 74.1/75.2 0.955 0.649\nMARN 77.7/78.9 77.9/78.2 0.938 0.691\nMFN 78.2/79.3 78.1/78.4 0.911 0.699\nRMFN 79.6/80.7 78.9/79.1 0.878 0.712\nLFN 79.1/80.2 77.3/78.1 0.899 0.701\nMulT 81.5/84.1 80.6/83.9 0.861 0.711\nBERT 83.5/85.2 83.4/85.2 0.739 0.782\nMAG-BERT 84.2/86.1 84.1 /86.0 0.712 0.796\nXLNet\nTFN 78.2/80.1 78.2/78.8 0.914 0.713\nMARN 78.3/79.5 78.8/79.6 0.921 0.707\nMFN 78.3/79.9 78.4/79.1 0.898 0.713\nRMFN 79.1/81.0 78.6/80.0 0.901 0.703\nLFN 80.2/82.9 79.1/81.6 0.862 0.701\nMulT 81.7/84.4 80.4/83.1 0.849 0.738\nXLNet 84.7/86.7 84.6/86.7 0.676 0.812\nMAG-XLNet 85.7/87.9 85.6 /87.9 0.675 0.821\nHuman 85.7/- 87.5/- 0.710 0.820\nTable 1: Sentiment prediction results on CMU-MOSI\ndataset.

Based on the in-\nformation from Table 1, we observe that MAG-\nBERT/MAG-XLNet models outperforms various\nbaseline models using BERT/XLNet/Glove models\nsubstantially.\n6.3 Adaptation at Different Layers\nWe also study the effect of applying MAG at dif-\nferent encoder layers of the XLNet. Speciﬁcally,\nwe ﬁrst apply the MAG to the output of the embed-\nding layer. Subsequently, we apply the MAG to the\nlayer j ∈{1,4,6,8,12}of the XLNet. Then, we\napply MAG at all the XLNet layers. From Table 2,\nwe observe that earlier layers are more suitable for\napplication of MAG.\nWe believe that earlier layers allow for better\nintegration of the multimodal information, as they\nallow the word shifting to happen from the begin-\nning of the network. If the semantics of words\nshould change based on the nonverbal accompani-\nments, then initial layers should reﬂect the semantic\nshift, otherwise, those layers are only working uni-\nmodally. Besides, the higher layers of BERT learn\nmore abstract and higher-level information about\nthe syntactic and semantic structure of linguistic\nfeatures (Coenen et al., 2019). Since, the acoustic\nand visual information present in our model corre-\nsponds to each word in the utterance, it will be more\ndifﬁcult for the MAG to shift the vector extracted\nfrom a later layer since that vector’s information\nwill be very abstract in nature.\n6.4 Input-level Concatenation and Addition\nFrom Table 2, we see that both input-level concate-\nnation and addition of modalities perform poorly.\nFor Concatenation, we simply concatenate all the\nmodalities. For Addition, we add the audio and\nvisual information to the language embedding after\nmapping both of them to the language dimension.\nThese results demonstrate the rationale behind us-\ning an advanced fusion mechanism like MAG.\n6.5 Results on Comparable Datasets\nWe also perform experiments on the CMU-MOSEI\ndataset (Zadeh et al., 2018d) to study the generaliza-\ntion of our approach to other multimodal language\ndatasets. Unlike CMU-MOSI which has sentiment\nannotations at utterance level, CMU-MOSEI has\nsentiment annotations at sentence level. The exper-\nimental methodology for CMU-MOSEI is similar\nto the original paper. For the sake of comparison,\nwe sufﬁce2 to comparing the binary accuracy and\nf1 score for the top 3 models in Table 1. In BERT\ncategory, we compare the performance of MulT\n(with BERT embeddings), BERT and MAG-BERT\nwhich are respectively as follows: [83.5,82.9]for\nMulT, [83.9,83.9]for BERT, and[84.7,84.5]for\nMAG-BERT. Similarly for XLNET category, the\nresults for MulT (with XLNet embeddings), XLNet\nand MAG-XLNet are as follows: [84.1,83.7]for\nMulT, [85.4,85.2]for XLNet and [85.6,85.7]for\nMAG-XLNet. Therefore, superior performance of\n2Since Transformer based models take a long time to train\nfor CMU-MOSEI\nMAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet also generalizes to\nCMU-MOSEI dataset.\n6.6 Fine-tuning Effect\nWe study whether or not the superior performance\nof the MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet is related to\nsuccessful ﬁnetuning of the models, or related to\nother factors e.g. any transformer with architec-\nture like BERT or XLNet would achieve superior\nperformance regardless of being pretrained. By ran-\ndomly initializing the weights of BERT and XLNet\nwithin MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet, we get the\nfollowing performance on BA for the CMU-MOSI:\n70.1 and 70.7 respectively. This indicates that the\nsuccess of the MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet is\ndue to successful ﬁne-tuning. Even on the larger\nCMU-MOSEI dataset we get BA of 76.8 and 78.4\nfor MAG-BERT and MAG-XLNet, which further\nsubstantiates the fact that ﬁne-tuning is successful\nusing MAG framework.\n6.7 Qualitative Analysis\nIn Table 3, we present some examples where MAG-\nXLNet adjusted sentiment intensity properly by\ntaking into account nonverbal information. The\nexamples demonstrate that MAG-XLNET can suc-\ncessfully integrate the non-verbal modalities with\ntextual information.\nIn both Example-1 and Example-2, XLNet cor-\nrectly predicted the polarity of the displayed emo-\ntion. However, additional information was present\nin the acoustic and visual domain which XLNet\ncould not utlize. Given those information, MAG-\nXLNet could better predict the magnitude of emo-\ntion displayed in both cases.\nAlthough the emotion in the text of Example-3\ncan be portrayed as a bit positive, the tense voice\nand frown expression helps MAG-XLnet reverse\nthe polarity of predicted emotion. Similarly, the\ntext in Example-4 is mostly neutral, but MAG-\nXLNet can predict the negative emotion through\nthe sarcastic vocal and frustrated facial expression.\n7 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced a method for efﬁciently\nﬁnetuning large pre-trained Transformer models\nfor multimodal language. Using a proposed Multi-\nmodal Adaptation Gate (MAG), BERT and XLNet\nwere successfully ﬁne-tuned in presence of vision\nand acoustic modalities. MAG essentially poses\nthe nonverbal behavior as a vector with a trajectory\nand magnitude, which is subsequently used to shift\nlexical representations within the pre-trained Trans-\nformer model. A unique characteristic of MAG is\nthat it makes no change to the original structure of\nBERT or XLNet, but rather comes as an attachment\nto both models. Our experiments demonstrated the\nsuperior performance of MAG-BERT and MAG-\nXLNet. The code for both MAG-BERT and MAG-\nXLNet are publicly available here 3\nAcknowledgement\nThis research was supported in part by grant\nW911NF-15-1-0542 and W911NF-19-1-0029 with\nthe US Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA) and the Army Research Ofﬁce\n(ARO).
