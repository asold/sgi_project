INTRODUCTION\nAs one of the most critical equipment in the power system,\nthe power transformer plays a signiﬁcant role in the process\nof power transmission and transformation. The oil-immersed\ntransformer takes oil as medium which has the functions of\nheat dissipation, insulation and arc suppression; thereby it\nhas found a wide application in different voltage levels and\ncapacities [1].\nDue to the high cost of the transformer, its lifespan is one of\nthe most concerned indices and it is affected by many factors,\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this article and approving\nit for publication was Mengmeng Li.\namong which the main one is the insulation aging. The local\noverheating causes the depolymerization of cellulose insula-\ntor and reduces the tensile strength and elasticity of cellulose\npaper, which makes the paper brittle and lose the ability to\nwithstand electric power and mechanical vibration [2], [3].\nOnce the insulation paper begins to age and to a certain\nextent, its maintenance is so demanding that it should be\nreplaced as soon as possible. But in fact, the aging paper\nmerely could not be replaced without replacing the winding.\nTherefore, the lifespan of insulation paper often determines\nthe service life of the transformer. Excessive winding temper-\nature will accelerate the aging of insulation paper, which will\ngreatly shorten the expected life of the transformer [4], [5].\n119110 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Liuet al.: Numerical and Experimental Investigation of Temperature Distribution for Oil-Immersed Transformer Winding\nMoreover, the local overheating seriously threatens the trans-\nformer service life and work efﬁciency as well, thus it is\nimportant to study the problems of winding temperature ris-\ning and hot-spot temperature for the safe and stable operation\nof power systems [6]–[8]. According to the design, the heat\ndissipation and cooling of transformer are mainly realized\nby the oil convection, and the oil ﬂow is the greatest factor\naffecting temperature distribution [9]. Therefore, the essential\nof the research on temperature rising and hot-spot tempera-\nture is to study the ﬂuid-thermal coupling problems of the\ntransformer windings [10]–[14].\nExperimental measurement and numerical simulation\nare the basic means to study these problems. It is\nimperative to ﬁnd an accurate and efﬁcient numeri-\ncal method to analyze the thermal characteristics of the\nwindings.\nFor the ﬂow and temperature distribution simulation of oil-\nimmersed transformer winding, the generally used numerical\nmethods include ﬁnite element method (FEM), ﬁnite volume\nmethod (FVM) and ﬁnite difference method (FDM), etc. The\nFVM is one of the most popular methods in CFD for its\nadvantages such as good conservation, good numerical stabil-\nity and strong applicability. However, the numerical conver-\ngence of FVM is relatively poor, and the ﬂuid-solid interfaces\nas well as the wall need to be processed separately. For a\nboundary-complex, multi-medium model, the computational\ncomplexity will be greatly increased [15]. As an efﬁcient\nand high-precision numerical method, FEM can also solve\nvarious CFD problems [16], [17] and ensure the continuity\nof heat ﬂux density without dealing with the ﬂuid-solid inter-\nface separately. It also has good adaptability when dealing\nwith complex boundary, and the calculation accuracy can be\nimproved by changing the interpolation method. However,\nthe numerical stability of the Galerkin FEM is poor and it is\nprone to non-physical numerical oscillation. In view of this,\nthe most direct approach is to reﬁne the mesh, which results in\nextra computation amount. Therefore, UFEM was proposed.\nBased on the weighted residual method of the Galerkin FEM,\nthe weight function of UFEM is not equal to the ordinary\ninterpolation function, but the upwind interpolation function.\nThe upwind interpolation function takes account of the ﬂow\ncharacteristics of the ﬂuid and must reﬂect obvious direc-\ntionality, so the code of UFEM is much more complex than\nthat of the Galerkin FEM. However, UFEM can effectively\neliminate numerical oscillations without extra computation\namount [18].\nLSFEM is an FEM based on the minimization of the\n2-norm of the residuals, which has many advantages of\nFEM, and makes up for some shortcomings furtherly. The\nnumerical stability of LSFEM is excellent, and the numer-\nical oscillation can be avoided without additional upwind\nor reﬁning mesh. In addition, the stiffness matrix generated\nby traditional FEM is not symmetrically positive deﬁnite,\nwhile the stiffness matrix of LSFEM is a symmetrically\npositive deﬁnite sparse matrix and can be solved by iteration\nmethods. The traditional FEM and the FVM both adopt an\nindirect coupling method to calculate the velocity-pressure\ncoupling problem, while LSFEM adopts the direct coupling\nmethod. Therefore, LSFEM has higher computation efﬁ-\nciency than other methods [19], [20]. However, the governing\nequations of incompressible ﬂuid are second-order partial\ndifferential equations. For LSFEM, the derivative of its base\nfunction being the continuous function is required, which\nmakes the issue more complicated. For easy realization in\npractical engineering, the second-order partial differential\nequation can be transformed into a ﬁrst-order partial differen-\ntial equation by introducing additional variables. It is worth\nmentioning that the condition number of stiffness matrix is\ntoo large due to the great difference of material physical\nparameters. In view of this, the ﬂuid governing equations\nwere transformed into dimensionless forms [21], [22], and\nthe stiffness matrix was preconditioned when solving the\nequation [23]. After these processes, the convergence and cal-\nculation efﬁciency of the numerical method can be improved\nsigniﬁcantly.\nLSFEM was applied to the simulation of the ﬂow dis-\ntribution of four simple examples: the Kovasznay ﬂow,\nthe 2D steady backward-facing step ﬂow, the 3D steady\nbackward-facing step ﬂow and the 2D unsteady circular\ncylinder ﬂow. The effectiveness of LSFEM was preliminar-\nily veriﬁed in solving ﬂow problems, but the heat transfer\nand ﬂuid-thermal coupling problems still remained unsolved\nin engineering applications [24]. Furthermore, LSFEM and\nUFEM were used to simulate the ﬂow and temperature dis-\ntribution of transformer partial windings. Although the accu-\nracies of the simulation results are considerably satisfactory,\nthe numerical model of winding is too simple to facilitate\nthe realization of the proposed method in which only one\npass was set and the effect of insulation paper and gravity\non the temperature had not been taken into account. Besides,\nthe tool for method effectiveness veriﬁcation is Fluent soft-\nware rather than experimental measurements, which lacks\nsufﬁcient persuasion [20]. In terms of the efﬁciency of the\nmethod, the conventional LSFEM (dimensional variables in\ngoverning equations) was used, and its convergence is poor\nwhen solving the ﬂuid-thermal coupling problem [25]. There-\nafter, the convergence of conventional LSFEM and DLSFEM\nwas analyzed. The convergence of DLSFEM is much better\nthan that of conventional LSFEM. However, the winding\nmodel is too simple and the number of meshes and nodes\nis so small that it is not sufﬁcient to prove the convergence\nsuperiority of DLSFEM in solving complex problems with\nlarge stiffness matrices [23].\nIn this paper, a product-level experimental platform of\ntransformer windings was set up, which included a com-\nplete winding temperature rising and cooling loop. Then the\nDLSFEM and UFEM were used to simulate the oil ﬂow and\ntemperature distribution, in which the turn-to-turn insulation\nand gravity were considered. The accuracy of the simulation\nresults was veriﬁed by the measured ones. Finally, a compari-\nson of the convergence between the DLSFEM and Fluent was\nmade.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 119111\nG. Liuet al.: Numerical and Experimental Investigation of Temperature Distribution for Oil-Immersed Transformer Winding\nII. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nA. GOVERNING EQUATION\nTransformer oil can be regarded as incompressible ﬂuid due\nto the little variation of its density. Thus, the ﬂow state can be\ndescribed by the following mass conservation equation and\nmomentum conservation equation :\n∇·U =0 (1)\n(ρU ·∇)U +∇p −µ∇2U =f (2)\nwhere U is the velocity vector of transformer oil, ρ is the\ntransformer oil density, p is the ﬂuid pressure, µ is the\ndynamic viscosity, and f stands for the external force density\nvector.\nThe ﬂuid and solid heat transfer of the transformer wind-\nings can be described by the energy conservation equation :\n∇·(ρCPUT )−∇· λ∇T =ST (3)\nwhere Cp is the oil speciﬁc heat capacity, T represents the\nKelvin temperature, λis the oil thermal conductivity, and ST\nstands for the heat loss density.\nB. DLSFEM DISCRETE FORM\nThe Navier-Stokes equation of incompressible ﬂow is a\nsecond-order partial differential equation. To facilitate the\nrealization of LSFEM, the vorticity ω is introduced to trans-\nform the second-order partial differential equation into a\nﬁrst-order one. The velocity-pressure-vorticity form of the\nNavier-Stokes equation and the mass conservation equation\nare obtained, as shown in (4):\n\n\n\n∇·U =0\n(ρU ·∇)U +∇p +µ∇×ω =f\nω −∇× U =0\n(4)\nThe transformer winding can be regarded as an axisymmet-\nric structure without taking the winding sticks and the duct\nspacers into account. Therefore, the numerical model in the\n2D cylindrical coordinates is adopted to study the ﬂow and\ntemperature distribution of the windings. The derivation of\nthe LSFEM discrete form combined with the dimensionless\nform in 2D cylindrical coordinates is given below.\nFirstly, the variables in the equations are converted into\ndimensionless forms, that is, the dimensionless variables can\nbe obtained by the ratio of basic variables to characteristic\nvariables. The detailed process is given in [21] and [22], and\nwill not be addressed in this paper for the sake of space\nlimitation. The dimensionless forms of (4) in cylindrical coor-\ndinates are as follows :\n\n\n\n1\nr\n∂(rur )\n∂r +∂uz\n∂z =0\nur\n∂ur\n∂r +uz\n∂ur\n∂z +∂p\n∂r − 1\nr ·Re(∂ωθ\n∂z ) =fr\nur\n∂uz\n∂r +uz\n∂uz\n∂z +∂p\n∂z + 1\nr ·Re\n∂(rωθ)\n∂r =fz\nωθ −1\nr\n∂ur\n∂z +1\nr\n∂uz\n∂r =0\n(5)\nwhere r is the radial coordinate, ur and uz represent the radial\nand axial velocity component separately, fr and fz are the\nradial and axial external force density component separately,\nRe =ρUL/µis the Reynolds number, U is the characteristic\nlength, L is characteristic velocity, and ωθ represents the\nvorticity component.\nWith the gravity term taken into account, the gravitational\nacceleration g is 9.81m/s2, and the axial component of exter-\nnal force density vector fz is ﬂuid buoyancy which is equal to\ng(ρ−ρref ), ρref is the reference oil density; without gravity,\ng =0 and the external force vector is equal to 0. Equation (5)\ncan be written as a matrix equation :\nA (g)=A1\n∂g\n∂r +A2\n∂g\n∂z +A3g =f (6)\nin which\nA1 =\n\n\n1 0 0 0\nu0\nr 0 1 0\n0 u0\nr 0 1\nRe\n0 1\nr 0 0\n\n\n(7)\nA2 =\n\n\n0 1 0 0\nu0\nz 0 0 − 1\nr ·Re\n0 u0\nz 1 0\n−1\nr 0 0 0\n\n\n(8)\nA0 =\n\n\n1\nr 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1\nr ·Re\n0 0 0 1\n\n\n(9)\nf =\n\n\n0\nfr\nfz\n0\n\n (10)\ng =\n\n\nur\nuz\np\nω\n\n (11)\nwhere u0\nr represents the radial velocity component after previ-\nous iteration, and u0\nz represents the axial velocity component\nafter previous iteration.\nThe residual function of (6) is constructed, as shown\nin (12):\nR =A (g)−f (12)\nAccording to the principle of the LSFEM, to minimize the\n2-norm of residual function, the following equation should be\ndeﬁned:\nI (g)=∥A (g)−f ∥2\n0 (13)\n119112 VOLUME 7, 2019\nG. Liuet al.: Numerical and Experimental Investigation of Temperature Distribution for Oil-Immersed Transformer Winding\nAccording to the variational method, (13) can be trans-\nformed into the following one :\n2\n∫\n\n(A ·g)T (A ·h −f )d=0 (14)\nwhere  is the solution domain, and h is the ﬁrst-order\nvariation of g. The quadrilateral mesh is used to divide the\nsolution domain, and the unknown variables in the element\ncan be obtained by interpolation :\ng =\nnd∑\nn=1\nNn (un,vn,pn,ωn)T (15)\nwhere g is the pending vector, nd is the node number in an\nelement, Nn stands for the interpolating function, and un, vn,\npn, and ωn are the radial velocity component, axial velocity\ncomponent, pressure and vorticity of the nth node in the\nelement, respectively.\nLet h =N, and substituting (15) into (14) yields :\n∫\n\n(AN1,AN2,··· ,ANn)T ·(AN1,AN2,··· ,ANn)\nGd=\n∫\n\n(AN1,AN2,··· ,ANn)T fd (16)\nwhere G is the degree of freedom (DOF) vector of the node.\nEquation (16) is the discrete equation form of DLSFEM,\nwhich can be written as :\nKG =F (17)\nwhere K is the global stiffness matrix and F is right-hand side\nfunction.\nIt can be seen from (16) that the stiffness matrix K formed\nby the DLSFEM is symmetrical, positive deﬁnite and sparse.\nIn addition, unlike the conventional FEMs, the velocity-\npressure coupling problem can be solved by the direct cou-\npling when solving the incompressible ﬂuid problem by\nDLSFEM. The penalty function method is adopted to impose\nboundary conditions. When solving the equation, the stiff-\nness matrix is preconditioned by the two-side equilibration\nmethod [26], and then the Jacobi preconditioned conjugate\ngradient method is employed to solve the equations [27].\nThis method can signiﬁcantly improve the convergence speed\nof the iterative solution, thereby reducing the computation\namount.\nC. UFEM DISCRETE FORM\nAfter solving the ﬂow velocity ﬁeld by DLSFEM, the wind-\ning temperature ﬁeld is calculated by UFEM which has\na good numerical stability and can effectively eliminate\nthe non-physical numerical oscillation phenomenon. Equa-\ntion (3) is discretized by the weighted residual method, and\nits speciﬁc form is as follows :\n∫\n\nWi (∇·(ρCPUT )−∇· λ∇T )d=\n∫\n\nWiST d (18)\nwhere Wi is the weight function, i =1,2,..., n, and n is the\nnode number.\nAccording to the principle of the Galerkin FEM, the weight\nfunction is equal to the interpolation function. To prevent\nnumerical oscillation, the upwind form is introduced :\nWi =Ni +αh\n2\nU\n|U|·∇Ni (19)\nwhere h is the characteristic length of element, and αrepre-\nsents the upwind correction factor.\nThe calculation formula of upwind correction factor in (19)\nis as follows :\nα=coth (Pe)− 1\nPe\n(20)\nwhere Pe is the Pellet number.\nPe =ρCp |U|h\n2λ (21)\nThe weight function of UFEM can be obtained by (19)-\n(21). The other derivation process is similar to that of the\nGalerkin FEM [28]. Finally, the UFEM discrete equation can\nbe obtained:\nn∑\nj=1\n{\nne∑\ne=1\n∫\n\n[ρCpWi\n(\nU ·∇Nj\n)\n+λ∇Wi ·∇Nj]d}Tj\n+\nn∑\nj=1\n\n\nne1∑\ne=1\n∫\n0\nhf WiNjd0\n\nTj\n=\nne∑\ne=1\n∫\n\nWiST d+\nne1∑\ne=1\n∫\n0\nhf WiTad0 (22)\nwhere ne is the total element number, ne1 is the element\nnumber of the second and third boundary conditions, 0is the\nexternal boundary of the ﬁeld, Ta is the ambient temperature,\nand hf stands for the heat transfer coefﬁcient.\nD. NUMERICAL METHOD OF FLUID-THERMAL COUPLING\nIn this paper, the DLSFEM and UFEM are combined to\nanalyze the ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds respectively. The cal-\nculation of temperature ﬁeld requires the parameters obtained\nfrom ﬂow ﬁeld calculation; meanwhile, the temperature also\naffects the physical parameters of the ﬂow ﬁeld. Therefore,\nthe sequential iteration method is applied to calculate the\nﬂuid-thermal coupling problem. The calculation process is\nillustrated in Fig. 1, where ε and σ are the convergence\ncriteria; that is, when the residuals of adjacent two steps are\nless than convergence criteria, the numerical solution can\nbe judged as convergent solution; otherwise, the sequential\niteration will continue.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nIn this paper, a product-level experimental platform of tem-\nperature rising and cooling for disc-type transformer winding\nis used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 119113\nG. Liuet al.: Numerical and Experimental Investigation of Temperature Distribution for Oil-Immersed Transformer Winding\nFIGURE 1. Process of fluid-thermal coupling calculation.\nThe model is mainly composed of the hollow disc-type non-\ninductive coils, oil tank, radiators, an oil pump, a fan, oil guide\ntubes, thermocouples and other components. The appearance\nand sketch graphs of the winding heating and cooling system\nare shown in Fig. 2.\nThe inner part of the oil tank of the experimental model\nconsists of the paper-wrapped copper conductor, inner panel,\nouter panel, guide washer, stick and duct spacer. Fig. 3 is the\nappearance graph of the winding.\nThe winding has eight passes. Among them, passes 1-3\ncontain seven discs, while passes 4-8 contain nine discs.\nThere are 66 discs in all in the winding. The winding is\ncomposed of continuous coils, and two coils are connected\nin parallel, and the wires go out at the terminals. Each disc\nconsists of 15 turns, and each turn of wire consists of two ﬂat\ncopper conductors wound together. In the last disc, the two\nﬂat copper conductors are welded together, so that the wind-\ning way of the two conductors is the same while the current\ndirection ﬂowing through them is opposite, which results\nin the offsetting of magnetic ﬁeld produced by them and\nthe elimination of the eddy current loss of the conductors.\nTherefore, the loss of the winding after electriﬁcation can\nbe considered as resistance loss only. In this way, the loss\ndensity under different currents can be obtained accurately.\nFor easy illustration, the passes of winding are numbered\nfrom 1 to 8 from top to bottom, and the discs are numbered\nfrom 1 to 66 from top to bottom. The ﬂat copper conductors\nare numbered from 1 to 30 from inner to outer axes.\nFIGURE 2. Appearance graph (a) and sketch graph (b) of the windings\nheating and cooling system.\nThe measurement system of the experimental model con-\nsists of a voltage regulator, a precision power analyzer,\n45 thermocouples, a liquid turbine ﬂow meter and a tem-\nperature logger. The thermocouples are arranged on discs\n12, 20, 30 and 38, and 11 temperature measuring points are\narranged on each disc, which are located on conductor 1, 4,\n7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28 and 30 respectively. In addition,\nthe thermocouple is arranged at the inlet of the tank to obtain\nthe oil temperature of the corresponding position.\nIV. NUMERICAL MODEL\nThe speciﬁc sizes of the model are listed in Table 1. Fig. 4\nshows the geometric sketch of the 2D numerical model of\nwindings. The thermocouples on the four discs are placed at\nthe same position. And the thermocouples arranged on Disc\n12 are demonstrated in the Fig. 4.\nThe inlet of the model is taken as the boundary of tem-\nperature and velocity. The inlet ﬂux is 25.18m 3/h, the inlet\ntemperature is 57 ◦C, and the calculated inlet velocity is\n0.2051m/s. The outlet is the pressure boundary which is\n0 Pa·m2. The insulating cylinder and washer are taken as the\n119114 VOLUME 7, 2019\nG.

Size of the numerical model.\nnon-slip wall boundaries. The oil tank wall being sealed with\ndouble-layer insulation material, it can effectively prevent the\nincrease of insulation material thermal conductivity due to\nthe water absorption, while the thermal conductivity of the\ninsulating cylinders is very small and can be regarded as an\nadiabatic boundary. The winding loss is considered as the\nheat source. The power factor of the winding measured by the\nprecision power analyzer is 0.99982, thus it can be assumed\nthat there is only ohmic loss in the winding loss. The power\nmeasured by the power analyzer is 56.023 kW. Considering\nthe effect of temperature on the resistance, the equation for\ncalculating ohmic loss with the temperature impact taking\ninto account is as follows [29]:\nP =P0 [1 +β(T −T0)] (23)\nwhere β=0.00393 is the temperature coefﬁcient of winding\nfor the coil is wounded by the copper conductors, P is the\nwinding loss density, and P0 is the winding loss density of\ntemperature T0.\nFIGURE 4. 2D numerical model of windings.\nTABLE 2. Material parameters of transformer.\nThe components involved in the numerical model are trans-\nformer oil, disc, insulation paper and washer. It should be\npointed out that the physical parameters of transformer oil are\ngreatly affected by temperature and should be expressed by\nfunctions of temperature, as shown in (24)-(27). The physical\nproperties of the other material are listed in Table 2.\nρ =1098.7 −0.712T (24)\nλ=0.1509 −7.1 ×10−5T (25)\nCp =807.2 +3.58T (26)\nµ=0.0846 −4 ×10−4T +5 ×10−7T 2 (27)\nV. RESULTS\nA. EFFECTS OF TURN-TO-TURN INSULATION\nON TEMPERATURE\nAs shown in Fig. 4, the insulation paper was so thin that ﬁner\nmeshing of the ﬂuid-solid interface and coil-paper interface\nwas needed to ensure the accuracy of calculation, which\nleads to a dramatic increase in the number of elements and\nnodes. Therefore, some researchers simpliﬁed the problem\nby ignoring the turn-to-turn insulation when analyzing the\nwinding temperature rising and hot-spot temperature. How-\never, whether the inﬂuence of turn-to-turn insulation on\nthe temperature can be neglected remains to be conﬁrmed.\nVOLUME 7, 2019 119115\nG. Liuet al.: Numerical and Experimental Investigation of Temperature Distribution for Oil-Immersed Transformer Winding\nTherefore, we compare and analyze the ﬂow and temperature\ndistributions through two cases:\nI. Models considering turn-to-turn insulation and gravity.\nII. Model considering gravity without considering turn-to-\nturn insulation\nIt can be seen from Fig. 5 that the difference of ﬂow distri-\nbution between case I and case II was not obvious. However,\nthe difference of temperature distribution was signiﬁcant.\nThe temperature distribution of case II on the same disc was\nbasically average. Moreover, the temperature rising of case I\non each disc was signiﬁcantly higher, and the distinct radial\nvariations of temperature between different conductors of the\nsame disc were found.\nTaking disc 12 as an example, the radial temperature vari-\nation curves in the two cases are shown in Fig. 6. It can be\neasily observed that the curve is very smooth for case II. The\ndifferences between maximum temperature and minimum\ntemperature were not more than 3 ◦C. In case I, there were\ndistinct radial variations of temperature, and the difference\nbetween maximum temperature and minimum temperature\nwas more than 20 ◦C. It can be concluded that the turn-to-\nturn insulation has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the temperature\ndistribution. The turn-to-turn insulation should be considered\nwhen analyzing the winding temperature rising and hot-spot\ntemperature.\nB. EFFECTS OF GRAVITY ON TEMPERATURE\nIt is necessary to compare the axial variations of temperature\ndistribution between model with gravity and without gravity\nfor gravity is an axial vector. There is an additional case:\nIII. Model considering turn-to-turn insulation without con-\nsidering gravity.\nThe axial temperature variation curves of case I and III\nalong the vertical center line of the numerical model are\nshown in Fig. 7. As can be seen, the difference mainly lied\nin the hottest disc of each pass. The maximum difference\nwas 2.7◦C.\nThe calculated average temperature, hot-spot temperature\nand hot-spot location on disc 12 in three cases are listed\nin Table 3. It can be seen that the simulation results of\ncase I were the close to the experimental ones. The simulation\nresults of case II were quite different from the experimental\nones, which means the inﬂuence of the turn-to-turn insulation\non temperature distribution is signiﬁcant. The simulation\nresults of case III were also in good agreement with the\nexperimental ones. However, as shown in Fig. 7, the effect\nof gravity on the temperature of the hottest disc in each pass\nis signiﬁcant. In summary, neither turn-to-turn insulation nor\ngravity could be ignored in the simulation of the temperature\ndistribution of windings.\nC. VALIDATION OF PROPOSED METHOD\nFrom the analysis above, it can be seen that the inﬂu-\nences of turn-to-turn insulation and gravity on temperature\nFIGURE 5. Flow and temperature distribution (a, c) with turn-to-turn\ninsulation and (b, d) without turn-to-turn insulation.\n119116 VOLUME 7, 2019\nG.

Axial temperature curves of disc in case I and case III.\nTABLE 3. Average temperatures, hot-spot temperatures and hot-spot\nlocations on disc 12 in three cases.\nrising and hot-spot temperature are particularly signiﬁcant.\nIf neglected, the simulation error would be large. Therefore,\nthe ﬂuid-thermal ﬁeld simulation using proposed method was\nbased on the model considering turn-to-turn insulation and\ngravity. At the same time, the simulation results of Fluent\nsoftware based on the FVM are given. Fig. 8 and 9 are the ﬂow\nand temperature distribution contours from pass 2 to pass 5.\nFrom the temperature distribution contour, it can be seen\nthat the hottest disc in each pass is the one close to the\nwasher. Some hot streaks can be observed at these positions.\nFIGURE 8. Contour of flow distribution obtained by Fluent software (left)\nand proposed method (right).\nFIGURE 9. Contour of temperature distribution obtained by Fluent\nsoftware (left) and proposed method (right).\nThe ﬂow and temperature distribution calculated by the pro-\nposed method were basically the same with those calculated\nby Fluent software, and the difference was not signiﬁcant.\nFig. 10 shows the temperature curves of experimental results\nand simulation results calculated by the proposed method and\nFluent software.\nAs can be seen from Fig. 10, both the proposed method and\nFluent software can approximately simulate the temperature\nvariation on the disc.\nTable 4 gives the average temperature and hot-spot tem-\nperature of each disc based on the proposed method, Fluent\nsoftware and experiment. As can be seen from Table 4, due to\nthe turn-to-turn insulation, the radial variation of temperature\non the same disc was very large, which makes a distinct\ndifference between the average temperature and the hot-\nspot temperature. That is the reason why the experimental\nVOLUME 7, 2019 119117\nG. Liuet al.: Numerical and Experimental Investigation of Temperature Distribution for Oil-Immersed Transformer Winding\nFIGURE 10. Temperature curves of experimental results and simulation\nresults calculated by the proposed method and Fluent software.\nTABLE 4. Average temperature and hot-spot temperature of discs.\nmeasurement in this paper arranged multiple temperature\nmeasuring points on one disc. The effectiveness of the pro-\nposed method is also veriﬁed by the comparison results.\nD. ERROR ANALYSIS\nThere are some differences between the simulation results of\nthe proposed method and those of the Fluent software. The\nfactors causing the differences are as follows:\n(1) The proposed method adopts the second-order ele-\nments. There are eight nodes in the element for velocity\nﬁeld calculation and nine nodes in the element for tem-\nperature ﬁeld calculation, while Fluent software adopts\nfour-node linear element. Different interpolation meth-\nods may lead to different results.\n(2) Different from Fluent software based on FVM, the pro-\nposed method is based on the DLSFEM and UFEM,\nso the discretization of equation is different.\n(3) Different numerical methods deal with boundary con-\nditions differently. The FVM deals with the ﬂuid-solid\ninterface separately, while the FEM does not.\nThere are many factors that may lead to the differences\nbetween simulation results and experimental ones, and some\nfactors are unavoidable, as stated as follows:\n(1) The 2D numerical model does not take into account the\ninﬂuence of sticks and duct spacers on the oil ﬂow and\nthe temperature distribution.\n(2) The transition of coil conductor from one disc to\nanother also affects the ﬂow and temperature distribu-\ntion, which is ignored by the numerical model.\n(3) Due to the extrusion effect of external force on the\nactual model, there exists uncertain compression com-\npared with actual size, that is, the height is not the same\nwith the one given in the blueprints, so there are some\ndifferences between the sizes of the numerical model\nand actual one.\n(4) When calculating the parameters, many simpliﬁcations\nhad been made for convenience. Therefore, the param-\neters such as the inlet velocity and loss density used\nin simulation may be different from those in the actual\nconditions.\nVI. CONTRAST OF CONVERGENCE\nIn this section, the convergence of the proposed method is\ncompared with that of Fluent. The numerical model of Fluent\n119118 VOLUME 7, 2019\nG.

Iterative step number of different convergence criteria.\nsoftware was meshed by ICEM CFD software. Quadrilateral\nelements were selected and the total number of nodes in the\nwhole solution domain was 2,182,489. The numerical model\nof the proposed method was meshed by ANSYS software.\nSimilarly, quadrilateral elements were selected. The total\nnumber of nodes in the whole solution domain was 2,303,993.\nThe convergence curves are drawn in Fig. 11.\nTable 5 gives the iteration steps required by the two meth-\nods under different convergence criteria. Obviously, the con-\nvergence of DLSFEM is better than that of Fluent software,\nand its iteration steps are much smaller in the meanwhile. The\nsmaller the convergence criterion is, the larger the difference\nof iteration steps between the two methods is.\nVII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, the inﬂuence of turn-to-turn insulation and grav-\nity on temperature distribution of transformer windings was\nanalyzed. The temperature rising of transformer winding with\nconsidering turn-to-turn insulation was much higher than that\nof transformer winding without considering inter-turn insu-\nlation. Moreover, the hot-spot temperature with considering\ngravity was signiﬁcantly lower than that without considering\ngravity. Therefore, it can be inferred that the inﬂuence of both\nturn-to-turn insulation and gravity on winding temperature\nshould be considered for accuracy of simulation.\nBased on the DLSFEM and UFEM, a hybrid method was\nproposed to analyze the temperature rising and hot-spot tem-\nperature of transformer windings. The results calculated by\nthe proposed method were approximately the same as the\nexperimental ones, and the iteration efﬁciency of the pro-\nposed method was much better than that of the Fluent soft-\nware adopting the FVM, which indicates the superiority of\nhigh accuracy and good convergence of the proposed method\nover other ones.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Z.
