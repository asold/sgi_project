Stereotypes about cuisines are a form of representa-\ntional harm that contribute to racialized public discourse and\nmay in turn perpetuate prejudice toward ethnic groups and\nnegatively impact restaurants’ economic outcomes (Luca\n2016; Muchnik, Aral, and Taylor 2013). For example, in the\nUnited States, Chinese food is commonly associated with\ndirty kitchens and cheap takeout, while French food is asso-\nciated with upscale dining (Hirose and Pih 2011; Ray 2007).\nUnderstanding the presence of representational harms in on-\nline corpora is especially important, given that these corpora\nCopyright © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nare used to train large language models (LLMs) that are in-\ncreasingly used to generate texts of all kinds.\nPrior work on immigrant food attitudes has used coarser-\ngrained signals such as numerical restaurant ratings (Ray\n2007) or studied review language within smaller scale\ndatasets (Johnston and Baumann 2007; Gottlieb 2015;\nGualtieri 2022; Hammelman, Carr Salas, and Tornabene\n2023). Meanwhile, larger-scale studies have ignored restau-\nrant and neighborhood-related factors (e.g., price point,\nneighborhood racial diversity) that may be confounded with\nreview sentiment (Boch, Jim´enez, and Roesler 2021; Yu and\nMargolin 2022). Prior studies have moreover relied on naive\nword-count-based methods that do not distinguish between\ncontextually different uses, e.g., a stinky restaurant vs. the\nstinky tofu (the latter being the name of a Chinese dish).\nWe build upon previous work through a study of fram-\ning in 2.1M English language Yelp reviews, leveraging NLP\nparsing techniques to conduct careful linguistic analysis of\nhow customers evaluate restaurants while controlling for\nrestaurant quality and neighborhood demographics (Figure\n1). Further, since LLMs are increasingly used to generate\nreviews and texts of all kinds, we investigate the persistence\nof human stereotypes in LLMs through a controlled review-\ngeneration task. Our research questions are the following:\nQ1 Framing of immigrant vs. non-immigrant food:How are\nimmigrant restaurants (i.e. those identified with a cui-\nsine based outside the US) 1 framed compared to non-\nimmigrant restaurants?\nQ2 Framing within immigrant foods:Are cuisines of more\nassimilated immigrant groups framed differently from\nthose of less assimilated groups?\nQ3 Framing in synthetic reviews: Do LLMs transmit the\nsame framing disparities as Yelp reviewers?\n1We recognize that questions of immigrant identity are deeply\nnuanced and individual; we thus rely solely on restaurants’ self-\nreported cuisine categories and their associated geographic regions\nto designate restaurants as immigrant or not. We similarly acknowl-\nedge that “US” cuisine is itself the result of multiple immigrant in-\nfluences, though these immigrant origins may not be as salient for\ncontemporary restaurants with US-related labels (e.g., New Ameri-\ncan, Southern) compared to cuisines of regions with high levels of\nongoing immigration. Nevertheless, we encourage future work to\nadopt a more nuanced treatment of individual cuisines.\nProceedings of the Eighteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM2024)\n985\n(Chinese) Their menu includes the usual American Chi-\nnese flairs like sweet and sour (fill in the blank), and (fill in\na meat) with black/white or sweet and sour sauce. But they\nalso have a lot of actual\nauthentic Chinese dishes [...] dim\nsum is the usual stuff, I’m not sure if they push it around in\na cart at lunch since I only go there for dinner. The service\nis pretty good, but because I been going there for a while\nthe owner is even nicer to my party if she happens to be\nour server. The place is very nice and\nclean [...]\n(Italian) [...] currently my favorite local Italian-American\nrestaurant by far. Their food is made with care and focus\non presentation. The prices are more than reasonable for\nthe breathtaking feasts sent to your table with each entree.\nWonderful classic dishes and surely the most impressive\nchicken-parm you will find in the state.\nFigure 1: Example reviews showing frames detected in our\nanalysis (blue: luxury; green: prototypicality; pink: hygiene;\ngray: authenticity). Both customers gave 4 stars and both\nrestaurants are designated as $ (on the 4-point scale $ to\n$$$$) with the same mean rating.\nThese questions are informed by work from the sociol-\nogy of taste. Regarding Q1, the theory of cultural omniv-\norousness posits that immigrant food is climbing in social\nstatus, as part of a broader contemporary shift occurring in\nother forms of cultural consumption (e.g., music) from a\nsmall number of highbrow genres to a more democratic va-\nriety (Peterson 1997). Crucially, this shift is enabled by the\nperception and framing of immigrant food as exotic and au-\nthentic: by valorizing immigrant food as novel, as well as\nauthentically so, consumers can legitimize their choice of\na more omnivorous palate beyond traditional haute cuisine,\nwhile still maintaining a pretense of discerning taste over\nan indiscriminate appetite (Johnston and Baumann 2007).\nAt the same time, the frames of exoticism and authenticity\nrepresent harmful forms of “othering” (Said 1978) that rein-\nforce a mode of outsider cultural consumption that objecti-\nfies food in reductive and essentializing ways.\nRegarding Q2, the theory of the ethnic succession of taste\nargues there are status differences in cuisines due to migra-\ntion patterns and resulting socioeconomic gaps. E.g., as Ital-\nian immigration to the US slowed in the 20th century and\nItalian Americans moved up the socioeconomic ladder, so\ntoo did the status of Italian food; conversely, Asian and His-\npanic food remain lower status, since ongoing Asian and\nHispanic immigration continues to populate low-wage jobs,\nespecially in the restaurant industry (Ray 2007, 2017). These\nstatus differences are reflected similarly to class distinctions\nin other domains of cultural consumption: whereas high-\nbrow genres tend to receive aesthetic and emotional judg-\nments, lowbrow genres are evaluated on functional and ma-\nterial criteria (Bourdieu 1987; Beagan, Power, and Chapman\n2015; Doma´nski et al. 2017). In a culinary context, the latter\ntranslates to a concern for hygiene and cost (Zukin, Linde-\nman, and Hurson 2017; Yu and Margolin 2022; Williamson\net al. 2009; Beagan, Power, and Chapman 2015; Hammel-\nman, Carr Salas, and Tornabene 2023). Together, these the-\nories paint a portrait of US food review discourse that others\nimmigrant cuisines and devalues those of less assimilated\nethnicities. Finally, we expect LLMs trained on online dis-\ncourse data to show similar tendencies, in line with work on\nrepresentational harms, e.g., Crawford (2017); Cheng, Dur-\nmus, and Jurafsky (2023). Thus, our hypotheses are:\nH1 Immigrant restaurants are othered (i.e. framed as more\nexotic H1a, prototypical H1b, and authentic H1c) com-\npared to non-immigrant restaurants.\nH2 Restaurants associated with more assimilated immigrant\ngroups are framed in high status terms of luxury H2a;\nconversely, restaurants of less assimilated groups are\nframed in low status terms of costH2b and hygiene H2c.\nH3 LLMs reproduce the same framing differences as Yelp\nreviewers.\nWe test our hypotheses using 2.1M reviews of restaurants\nin 14 US states, controlling for factors such as restaurant\nprice and star rating. We focus on the three largest sources\nof immigrant food in the US: European cuisine (EUR), Asian\ncuisine (AS), and Latin American cuisine (LAT).\nWe find evidence for all 3 sets of hypotheses: immigrant\nrestaurants are overwhelmingly more likely to be described\nas authentic, though only A S and LAT are more likely to be\ndescribed as exotic. We also find A S and L AT are framed\nas more authentic in zipcodes with fewer Asian and His-\npanic residents, respectively, suggesting that othering may\nbe driven by cultural outsiders, rather than the members of\nan ethnic group themselves.\nFurther, reviewers are more likely to describe AS and LAT\nas cheap and dirty compared to E UR. These disparities per-\nsist even for the most expensive $$$-$$$$ restaurants (Yelp\ncategorizes restaurants into 4 tiers based on menu prices: $,\n$$, $$$, $$$$), supporting the idea of a culinary glass ceil-\ning preventing the cuisines of less assimilated non-European\nimmigrants from attaining the same status as their European\ncounterparts (Ray 2017).\nFinally, we find that GPT-3.5 shows similar framing dis-\nparities to human consumers, with immigrant cuisines sub-\nject to more othering and non-European immigrant cuisines\nreceiving more low status framing.\nTogether, our results corroborate social theories about\nracialized evaluative processes and the systematic deval-\nuation of non-white associated cuisines, and demonstrate\ndownstream harms present in LLMs. Our dictionaries and\nmethods2 can further be applied to other domains of cultural\nconsumption to study perceptions of immigrant cultures in\nour increasingly globalized society.\nData and Methods\nReal Consumer Reviews.We use the Yelp open dataset, 3\ncontaining 5.2M reviews from 2005-2022 of 64K US-based\nbusinesses (after subsetting to restaurants only). We addi-\ntionally exclude chain restaurants, cafes, and fast food. We\n2https://github.com/yiweiluo/immigrant-food-framing/\n3www.yelp.com/dataset, retrieved January 2023, ©Yelp Inc.\n986\nuse businesses’ self-declared category tags to obtain cuisine\nlabels for each business (e.g., Italian, Mexican) and perform\nanalyses on the top 25 cuisines, excluding Asian fusion, eth-\nnic food, Caribbean, Middle Eastern,and Tex-Mex as these\nare difficult to associate with a single region. We then map\ncuisine labels to broader regions (e.g., Italian → Europe,\nMexican → Latin America). Since some restaurants belong\nto multiple regions (e.g., Mexican & Spanish), we subset to\nrestaurants whose cuisines all map to a single region. The\nabove filtering steps yield 2.1M reviews of 16K restaurants\nbased primarily in 14 states, mapping onto the 3 primary\nsources of immigrant food in the US: European food (EUR),\nAsian food (A S), and Latin American food (L AT), in ad-\ndition to non-immigrant food (i.e. associated with a US-\nbased cuisine). Since cuisine distribution within regions is\nnon-uniform, we replicate analyses with the most frequent\ncuisine per region removed and at the level of individual\ncuisines (see Appendix). Table 1 summarizes dataset totals\nand Figure 2 shows distribution over cuisines per state. We\nnote that Yelp’s dataset is highly skewed towards restau-\nrants in Pennsylvania and Florida, and not representative of\nrestaurant concentration in the US overall.\nLLM Reviews. For synthetically generated reviews, we\nprompt the gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-3.5-\nturbo-1106 models via Chat Completion API. For all\nprompts, we varied price point ($ – $$$$), cuisine (Table\n1), and sentiment. To collect a variety of review content\ncomparable to Yelp reviews, we also varied the focus of\nthe review for two of our prompts (e.g., entr ´ees, staff, am-\nbiance). We also matched the actual distribution of senti-\nment ratings in Yelp reviews, which skews highly positive\n(45% 5-stars). Occasionally, generated reviews contain dis-\nclaimer text (e.g., “As an AI language model, I can say\nthat this customer seems happy with their experience at a\nFrench restaurant. They specifically mention that the prices\nare affordable [...]”). We removed such disclosure text from\nsynthetic reviews so as to analyze only instances of fram-\ning from the first person perspective rather than the LLM’s\nmeta-commentary (i.e. in the above example, we did not\ncount “prices are affordable” toward cost framing). After\nsubsampling to stratify evenly across cuisine regions, our\ndataset contained 58K total synthetic reviews. See Appendix\nfor further details on our prompting parameters.\nExtracting Linguistic Features.We focus on the framing\nof three basic restaurant attributes: food (e.g., chicken, noo-\ndles), staff (e.g., waiter, server), and the venue (e.g., place,\natmosphere). We measure framing via the adjectives modi-\nfying tokens from each of the 3 anchor sets. By targeting the\nframing of specific attributes, we obtain higher precision and\nmore interpretable results compared to aggregate measures\nof sentiment over the entire text of reviews. For instance,\nwe distinguish true evaluative uses (e.g., a regular Mexican\nplace; the restaurant wasstinky) from false positives (e.g., I\nam aregular, I had thestinky tofu). We curate anchor sets\n4Yelp collapses Cajun and Creole into a single category. Since\nboth cuisines have immigrant origins (West African, French), we\nre-do analyses without this category and the main results still hold.\nRegion CuisineNon-imm.\nUS american traditional (3.6K,\n546K),\namerican new (3.1K, 561K), cajun/creole4\n(0.5K, 161K), southern (0.5K, 141K),\nsoul food (0.3K, 43.7K)\nImmigrant\nLAT mexican (1.7K,\n184K), latin american\n(0.4K, 42.9K), cuban (0.1K, 14.4K)\nEUR italian (2.2K, 228K), mediterranean (0.5K,\n63.4K), greek (0.3K, 32.9K), french (0.2K,\n26.2K), irish (0.1K, 10.1K), spanish (60, 11.6K)\nAS chinese (1.6K, 122K), japanese (1.1K, 146K)\nthai (663, 81.6K), vietnamese (527, 57.3K)\nindian (442, 46.1K), korean (306, 36.4K)\nTable 1: Summary of Yelp cuisine categories, associated ge-\nographic regions, and (#restaurants, #reviews) in our dataset.\nPA\nFL\nTN\nMO\nLA\nIN\nNJ\nAZ\nAB\nNV\nCA\nID\nDE\nIL\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000#Restaurants\nus\nlatin america\neurope\nasia\nFigure 2: Distribution of restaurants over cuisine, state.\nwith WordNet and augment the food anchors with a dataset\nof menu items (Jurafsky et al. 2016). We parse all reviews\nusing spaCy with the Coreferee add-on and leverage depen-\ndency parse relations to retrieve adjectival features, exclud-\ning those under the scope of negation (e.g., not clean). We\nthen aggregate adjectival features over all anchor sets.5\nQuantifying Framing.We quantify framing along broader\ndimensions of interest with hand-crafted dictionaries. We\nmeasure raw counts of linguistic features belonging to each\ndictionary within review texts to obtain numerical framing\nscores along each dimension. We next aggregate framing\ndimensions into broader theoretical constructs as follows:\nwe measure othering as exoticism, which asserts difference\nand unfamiliarity; authenticity, which asserts faithfulness\nto something’s ethnic origins and thus implicitly situates it\noutside the mainstream (Boch, Jim´enez, and Roesler 2021),\nand prototypicality, a related form of the “outsider gaze”\nthat asserts all X are alike (Rhodes, Leslie, and Tworek\n2012; Golash-Boza 2016). We measure perceived high and\nlow status as luxury and fine dining, hygiene (a marker of\nlow perceived status (Zukin, Lindeman, and Hurson 2017;\nYu and Margolin 2022)), and cost/value (another marker of\nlow perceived status (Williamson et al. 2009)). We acknowl-\nedge that these dimensions do not exhaustively measure\n5In early analyses, we examined framing along each attribute\nindividually but found no notable differences.\n987\nstatus/class distinction as a broader construct, though they\nrepresent particularly salient dimensions given longstanding\ntheoretical work showing that lowbrow genres are evaluated\non functional and material criteria (Bourdieu 1987; Beagan,\nPower, and Chapman 2015; Doma´nski et al. 2017).\nOur lexicons for exoticism and authenticity are based on\nsocial science work (Johnston and Baumann 2007; Yu and\nMargolin 2022; Kov ´acs, Carroll, and Lehman 2014) and\naugmented with a thesaurus. For the other framing dimen-\nsions, we use the Empath lexicon induction tool (Fast, Chen,\nand Bernstein 2016). We manually filter false positives from\nall lexicons. Example lemmas per framing dimension/con-\nstruct are shown in Table 2. See Appendix for full lexicons.\nConstruct Frame Example features\nOthering\nExoticism different, distinctive,\nexotic, foreign, odd\nPrototypicality archetypal, classic,\nstereotypical, usual\nAuthenticity authentic, handmade,\nlegit, traditional\nStatus (high) Luxury alluring, classy,\nelegant, posh, refined\nStatus (low)\nCost affordable, budget,\ncheap, overpriced\nHygiene clean, dirty, grimy,\nnasty, sanitary, stinky\nTable 2: Example lemmas for each framing dimension.\nControlling for Confounds in Real World Reviews.In\nreal world reviews, consumer sentiment is confounded with\na number of factors beyond cuisine region, such as review\nlength, a restaurant’s price point and average star rating, and\nattributes of the restaurant’s neighborhood, such as median\nincome and racial diversity. We control for these confounds\nby including them as covariates in regression analyses to\npredict framing from cuisine region. We check for multi-\ncollinearity among features and find none (variance infla-\ntion factors all below 2.0). Figure 3 shows the distribution\nof restaurants used in our analyses along restaurant- and\nneighborhood-attributes. Restaurant price point and mean\nstar rating data is supplied by the Yelp Academic dataset;\nneighborhood income and racial diversity figures were ex-\ntracted from 2020 census data after linking each restau-\nrant’s geographic coordinates to individual census tracts.\nYelp does not release user-specific information, so we were\nnot able to control for user attributes (e.g., age, gender).\nInstead, we replicate analyses on the reviews of 89 high-\nvolume reviewers and find similar framing disparities across\ncuisines, within a single user (see Appendix).\nQualitatively Measuring Framing.Separate from our re-\ngressions, which as we will see later in the Results section,\nreveal disparities in aggregate framing scores, we are also\ninterested in qualitative differences in how cuisines are re-\nviewed. We use the Fightin’ Words method (Monroe, Co-\nlaresi, and Quinn 2008), which measures the strength of as-\nFigure 3: Distribution of restaurants along price point (corre-\nsponding to Yelp-designated $), mean star rating, neighbor-\nhood income (2020 USD), and neighborhood racial diversity\nfrom 2020 (computed as the Simpson Diversity Index).\nsociation between individual features with a given sample\nas the weighted log-odds ratio between a feature occurring\nin a given sample over a reference sample. In our case, we\ncompare a feature’s odds of occurring in a review of cuisine\nC to its odds of occurring in a review of a non-C cuisine.\nWe also include an informative prior in the form of all re-\nview texts, and compute the z-score to measure the statistical\nsignificance of the association after controlling for variance\nin feature frequency.

This model predicts each form of\nothering from cuisine region, while controlling for review\nlength, restaurant mean star rating, restaurant price point,\nneighborhood median income, and neighborhood racial di-\nversity. Additionally, we qualitatively explore how each cui-\nsine is othered using the Fightin’ Words method (see Eq. 1;\nalso Monroe, Colaresi, and Quinn (2008)).\nWe find from our regression analyses that overall, H1a-c\nare all borne out: othering along all 3 dimensions is quantita-\ntively more prevalent in reviews of immigrant cuisine (Fig-\nure 4). However, we also observe intra-cuisine variance: oth-\nering of immigrant cuisine is driven primarily by A S and\nLAT, with both cuisines consistently framed as more ex-\notic, and A S framed as more prototypical. In contrast, E UR\nis not framed as significantly more exotic or prototypical\nthan non-immigrant cuisine (which is consistently associ-\nated with a decrease in othering). The negative coefficients\nfor non-immigrant and E UR exoticism in particular support\nJaner’s (2005) suggestion that US dining culture remains\nstrongly rooted in a Western culinary perspective,6 with non-\nEuropean immigrant cuisines perceived as different with re-\nspect to this implicit reference point.\nQualitatively, we find from applying the Fightin’ Words\nmethod (Eq. 1) that there are also notable differences in how\nEUR vs. A S and L AT are othered (Table 3). Although all\ncuisines are described with neutral prototypicality features\n(e.g., regular, standard, typical), only EUR is described with\npositive features like classic and exemplary. Both the neu-\ntral and positive features represent essentializing language\nin that they reduce a cuisine to a prototype, but the posi-\ntive features do so by placing favorable emphasis on certain\nrepresentative elements of a cuisine. Our results also corrob-\norate Gualtieri (2022), who found that non-white restaurants\nin the Michelin Guidetend to be described in terms of au-\nthenticity, and European restaurants according to what they\ncall the “logic of technique,” or terms like exemplary that\nassert the existence of a prized culinary canon.\nFurther, we notice that authenticity is afforded to E UR\nthrough adjectives of simplicity, such as homemade, rustic,\nand quaint, whereas L AT and A S are afforded authenticity\nby being authentic or legit. In particular, E UR authenticity\nfeatures evoke the current prestige fare of simple, artisanal,\nfarm-to-table cooking championed by restaurateurs such as\nAlice Waters of Chez Panisse. As Ray (2007, p.100) writes:\n“The craftsmanship of bourgeois home-cooking was the new\nposture, contrasted with the mannered style of French haute\ncuisine [...] Rusticity replaced elegance.” In other words, the\nframing of EUR authenticity via simplicity may reflect high\ncultural capital rather than authenticity per se.\nStudy 1B: Othering by Cultural Outsiders.Since we posit\nthat the above framing dimensions of exoticism, prototypi-\ncality, and authenticity are forms of gastronomic othering,\nin which a cuisine is objectified by outsiders, we expect oth-\nering to interact with the racial background of reviewers.\nFor instance, Boch, Jim´enez, and Roesler (2021) found that\nreviews of Mexican restaurants mentioned authenticity less\nin areas with larger Mexican populations. Demographic in-\nformation for Yelp users is not available in the dataset, so\n6Or perhaps, a Global North perspective. The Global North\nvs. South division could also explain why Japan patterns more like\nEurope than Asia for certain kinds of framing, though we do not\nsee this for South Korea (see per-cuisine results in the Appendix).\n989\nwe similarly examine the influence of the % population of\nself-identifying Asian and Hispanic residents in the neigh-\nborhood as a proxy, using 2020 census data linked to each\nrestaurant’s postal code.7 In cases where users self-divulge\nthat they are not locals (e.g., “I’m from out of state”), we\ndetect and exclude those users’ reviews with a regex filter.\nWe fit two separate linear regression models 8 to exam-\nine the effect of local self-identifying Asian and Hispanic %\npopulation on othering of AS and LAT, respectively (i.e. the\neffect of cultural outsiders). We find that a higher % popula-\ntion of cultural outsiders significantly increases authenticity\nframing for A S and L AT (Figure 5). Interestingly, a higher\n% population of outsiders did not have significant effects\non exoticism framing and had inconsistent effects on pro-\ntotypicality framing: while areas with fewer Hispanic res-\nidents had more prototypicality framing, those with more\nAsians had less. However, these results may be skewed by\nthe narrow range of geographic regions represented in our\ndataset, especially in the case of Asian neighborhoods: 83%\nof the neighborhoods with a high Asian % population are lo-\ncated in Pennsylvania, and 36% of high Hispanic % popula-\ntion neighborhoods are located in Florida (despite PA having\nonly 4% of the overall US Asian population and FL having\nonly 26% of the overall US Hispanic population).\nexot. proto. auth.\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08Othering coefficient\nns\n**\n***\nAsian restaurants\nPct.

Since regressions are fit within the sample of A S\nor LAT restaurants, we omit the cuisine type variable.\nStudy 2: Low Status Framing of Non-European\nCuisines\nTo test our second set of hypotheses concerning status fram-\ning, i.e. restaurants of less assimilated immigrant groups are\nreviewed less in high status terms of luxury H2a and more\nin low status terms of cost H2b and hygiene H2c, we fit\nlinear regression models (Equation 2) to predict status fram-\ning from cuisine region, while controlling for the same con-\nfounds as in Study 1A (restaurant price point, stars, neigh-\nborhood income and diversity). Since Study 2 does not make\nexplicit predictions about othering, we did not examine the\neffect of reviewer racial background as in Study 1B. To qual-\nitatively explore how different cuisines are framed as high\nvs. low status, we used the Fightin’ Words method (Eq. 1) to\nretrieve the features most associated with each cuisine.\nWe find from our regression analyses support forH2: LAT\nand A S (associated with less assimilated Latin Americans\nand Asians) receive less luxury framing, and more cost and\nhygiene framing, compared to EUR (Figure 6).\nEur Lat.Am Asia\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\nRegression coefficient\n****\n**** ****\nLuxury framing\nEur Lat.Am Asia\n****\n**** ****\nCost framing\nEur Lat.Am Asia\n****\n****\n****\nHygiene framing\nFigure 6: Europe afforded higher status: Linear regression\ncoefficients predicting high↑ (luxury) and low status↓ (cost;\nhygiene) framing from cuisine region, controlling for re-\nview length, restaurant mean star rating, restaurant price\npoint (reference level: $$), neighborhood median income\nand racial diversity.

Interestingly, EUR\nis the only cuisine to receive more dirty than clean framing,\nsuggesting that its cleanliness may be taken for granted, and\nhygiene conditions are only noteworthy when dirty. Evalu-\nating a restaurant in terms of hygiene, regardless of whether\nthe framing is positive (clean) or negative (dirty), presup-\nposes that cleanliness is a relevant and important dimension\nof discussion, reflecting and potentially reinforcing negative\nassumptions about sanitary conditions of AS and LAT.\nGlass Ceiling Effect.

Although we control for price point in all\nanalyses, we wished to more carefully examine the extent\nof framing disparities: even within the most upscale tier, do\nnon-EUR cuisines continue to receive more low status and\nless high status framing compared to EUR?\nWe find that framing disparities persist within reviews of\nhigh price point restaurants, pointing to a glass ceiling ef-\nfect by which A S and L AT are viewed as lower status than\ntheir EUR counterparts (Figure 8).9 This effect is most pro-\nnounced for AS, which continues to be evaluated as less lux-\nurious, and more in terms of cost and hygiene, and slightly\nless pronounced for LAT, which continues to be evaluated as\nless luxurious and more in terms of cost.\nStudy 3: Reporting Bias in LLMs\nLLMs are being used increasingly for content creation in all\nsorts of domains—marketing, academic research, legal con-\ntexts, creative writing—and by users who may be unaware\nof the social biases and stereotypes they contain.

Despite debiasing efforts, simple prompts suggest\nthat stereotypes in human reviews may propagate to LLMs.\nFor instance, when asked to compare French and Korean\nculture, one of the “key distinctions” that ChatGPT identi-\nfies is “Cuisine: French cuisine is renowned for its sophisti-\ncation, emphasis on quality ingredients, and intricate prepa-\nration methods. Korean cuisine is characterized by bold fla-\nvors, a variety of side dishes (banchan), and a reliance on\nstaples like rice and kimchi” (Figure 9).\nFrench and Korean cultures exhibit significant dif-\nferences shaped by their unique histories, societal\nnorms, and traditions. Here are some key distinc-\ntions: 1. Cultural Orientation: French culture tends\nto be more individualistic [...] 5. Cuisine: French cui-\nsine is renowned for its sophistication, emphasis on\nquality ingredients, and intricate preparation meth-\nods. Korean cuisine is characterized by bold flavors,\na variety of side dishes (banchan), and a reliance on\nstaples like rice and kimchi [...]\nFigure 9: ChatGPT’s response to the prompt: “What are\nsome differences between French and Korean culture?” Re-\ntrieved December 26, 2023.\nHere we test our final hypothesis H3, whether framing\ndisparities in online text corpora indeed propagate to the\nLLMs trained on them. To do this, we conduct a controlled\nreview-generation task in which we prompt GPT-3.5 to write\nreviews evaluating hypothetical restaurants that differ in\nprice point and cuisine using a variety of prompts and mod-\n991\nels (Appendix Table 8). We then quantitatively test H3 us-\ning regression models10 to predict othering and status fram-\ning from cuisine region. We also qualitatively study LLM\nstereotypes using the Fightin’ Words method (Eq. 1).\nRegardless of the specific prompt and model used, 11 we\nfind from our regression analyses (N=58K) that GPT-3.5 ex-\nhibits many of the same tendencies as Yelp consumers, such\nas othering A S and LAT through frames of authenticity and\nexoticism (Table 5). However, we also see that immigrant\nrestaurants are framed as less prototypical compared to non-\nimmigrant restaurants. Nevertheless, closer inspection re-\nveals that the main overlap between synthetic reviews and\nour prototypicality lexicon is due to the word classic (rather\nthan words like stereotypical or standard, as we found in\nhuman reviews), suggesting that our measurement of pro-\ntotypicality captures a construct more akin to “iconicity” in\nthe context of synthetic reviews. Moreover, similar to human\nreviews, we found that LLMs frame EUR with higher status\ncompared to AS and LAT (Table 6).\nFinally, qualitative results of the features most strongly\nassociated with each region (Table 7) exemplify additional\nstereotypes, such as the stereotype of tropicalism for L AT\n(e.g., vibrant, lively, festive) (Martynuska 2016), suggesting\nthat gastronomic and cultural stereotypes in LLMs are not\nlimited to the ones we study in the present work.\nEUR LAT AS Immigrant\nExot. -0.01 0.09** 0.07* 0.05\nProto. -0.09** -0.14*** -0.23*** -0.15***\nAuth. 0.32*** 0.33*** 0.30*** 0.32***\nTable 5: Linear regression coefficients predicting othering in\nGPT-3.5 reviews from cuisine region, controlling for review\nsentiment (reference level: neutral), showing that, as with\nYelp reviews, immigrant restaurants are othered with frames\nof authenticity, and A S and L AT with frames of exoticism.\nUnlike Yelp reviews, immigrant restaurants are framed as\nless prototypical.

Despite the reputation of the\nUS as a culinary melting pot, we find that immigrant restau-\nrants are systematically described as more authentic, and\nAsian and Latin American restaurants in particular are de-\nscribed as more exotic. Further, we find that restaurants as-\nsociated with less assimilated Asian and Latin American im-\nmigrants are more likely to be reviewed as cheap and dirty\ncompared to European restaurants. Our results are robust\nto differences in restaurant price, average star rating, and\nneighborhood income and racial diversity. We further show\nthat LLMs replicate similar framing tendencies.\nBeyond creating representational harms, such as reinforc-\ning negative perceptions of immigrant cultures, framing dif-\nferences in online reviews may contribute to economic in-\nequality, since reviews can influence the decisions of mil-\nlions of consumers (Luca 2016). Future work could seek to\nbetter understand and quantify the link between differences\nin review language and restaurant revenue.\nThere are a number of limitations in our current studies\nthat future work could address. We found an inconsistent\neffect of reviewer race on othering, potentially due to the\ncoarse estimate of race (based on restaurant zipcode) we\nused. Future research can explore datasets in which racial\nbackground at the level of individual users is available. We\nalso made a number of simplifying assumptions in locat-\ning individual cuisines within broader regions, and neglected\nentire regions due to sparsity. Future work could explore\nwithin-region and within-cuisine variance more carefully, as\nwell as study a wider range of cuisines. In addition, future\nwork could study a more representative sample of US cities,\nas well as review language outside the US.\nFinally, our work points to a need for strategies to com-\nbat representational harms in online food discourse. Con-\ntrolled psychological experiments could reveal the deeper\nmechanisms underlying observed framing differences, and\nAI-mediated tools could intervene during the review-writing\nprocess. For instance, web plug-ins could alert reviewers to\n992\nRegion Dominant features\nUS southern (18.5) fried (9.8) soulful (5.1) rustic (4.9) crispy (4.4) cheesy (4.4) slow (2.9) classic (2.5)\ngooey (2.5) dry (2.5) mediocre (2.4) terrible (2.2) local (2.2) creamy (2.1) overpriced (2.1)\nEUR romantic (5.8) charming (4.9) traditional (4.8) hearty (4.1) mashed (3.5) creamy (3.2) perfect (3.1) cozy (2.9)\nwarm (2.6) red (2.4) stuffy (2.1) soft (2.1) exquisite (2.0) stuffed (2.0) rich (2.0) thin (2.0)\nLAT vibrant (11.2) lively (11.2) colorful (6.7) authentic (4.7) black (3.6) energetic (3.4) fun (3.4) shredded (3.2) festive (3.1)\nmoist (2.6) upbeat (2.4) homemade (2.3) seasoned (2.2) mixed (2.1) tender (2.1) generous (2.0) friendly (2.0)\nAS wide (6.0) fresh (5.0) aromatic (4.9) clean (4.1) modern (4.1) sticky (3.9) iced (3.7) fragrant (3.5) spicy (3.5)\nbeautiful (3.2) authentic (3.2) elegant (3.2) steamed (3.2) serene (3.1) hot (2.9) soothing (2.6) helpful (2.6) peaceful (2.5)\nbalanced (2.4) comfortable (2.3) marinated (2.3) pickled (2.2) light (2.1) quick (2.1) traditional (2.1) stunning (2.1)\nTable 7: Features most associated with each cuisine within GPT-3.5-generated reviews.

We perform all our anal-\nyses on aggregate and avoid targeting any specific users\nor restaurants. We rely on restaurants’ self-declared cuisine\ntags rather than inferring cuisine labels from other attributes,\nwhich may encourage biased profiling practices. We also\nuse purely geographic criteria to locate individual cuisines\nwithin broader regions, so as to limit similar profiling biases.\nDue to data sparsity, we regrettably omitted cuisines from\nAfrica, the Middle East, and Oceania, in addition to many in-\ndividual countries and culinary traditions. We also excluded\nintersectional cuisines with connections to multiple regions,\nsuch as Caribbean cuisine and Tex-Mex. In next steps, we\naim to re-include omitted cuisines to resist tendencies of\nmarginalizing minorities. We also recognize that the Yelp\nuser base skews toward college-educated people with high\nincomes.12 Our findings should therefore not be taken as rep-\nresentative of US consumers as a whole.\nAdditionally, our experiments with LLMs may engen-\nder risks associated with adversarial use (e.g., abuse of our\nprompting procedure to “review bomb” businesses with neg-\native reviews). Finally, by studying stereotypes and frames\nof cultural prejudice, we risk further reifying these con-\nstructs. At the same time, we hope this work stimulates re-\nflection, conversation, and additional research to interrogate\nand dismantle the preconceived attitudes that each of us as a\nconsumer and restaurant-goer may hold.\nFurther Related Work\nOur work extends theoretical and empirical work on the\nsociology of taste (Bourdieu 1987; Peterson 1997; John-\nston and Baumann 2007; Williamson et al. 2009), espe-\ncially as it relates to racialized criticism and the devalu-\nation of marginalized producers (Grazian 2005; Childress\nand Nault 2019; Chong 2011; Janer 2005; Liu 2009; Ray\n2007, 2017; Gualtieri 2022; Hammelman, Carr Salas, and\nTornabene 2023). We also draw from the broader litera-\ntures on othering, authenticity, and stereotyping (Said 1978;\n12https://www.yelp-press.com/company/fast-facts/default.aspx\nMartynuska 2016) and work examining these attitudes in\nYelp reviews (Hirose and Pih 2011; Kov ´acs, Carroll, and\nLehman 2014; Gottlieb 2015; Boch, Jim ´enez, and Roesler\n2021) and food contexts more broadly (Freedman and Ju-\nrafsky 2011; Lee et al. 2012; Oleschuk 2017). We are also\ninspired by work on representational harms in discourses of\nrace and ethnicity (Card et al. 2022) and in machines (Craw-\nford 2017; Barocas, Hardt, and Narayanan 2017; Blodgett\net al. 2020; Cheng, Durmus, and Jurafsky 2023).\nAnalyzing broader social aspects of food through online\ntext has been an active area of research. Previous work lever-\naged various data sources, e.g., menus (Jurafsky et al. 2016;\nTurnwald et al. 2020), search engine logs (West, White, and\nHorvitz 2013; Gligori´c et al. 2022), recipes (Wagner, Singer,\nand Strohmaier 2014; Trattner, Moesslang, and Elsweiler\n2018), and review platforms (Jurafsky et al. 2014; Chor-\nley et al. 2016). ICWSM research, in particular, has focused\non studying diets through social media, such as Instagram\n(Garimella, Alfayad, and Weber 2016; Ofli et al. 2017) and\nTwitter (Mejova, Abbar, and Haddadi 2016; Gligori´c, Djord-\njevi´c, and West 2022). Our work is also related to studies\nof the impact of reviews on restaurant performance (Luca\n2016; Kim, Li, and Brymer 2016; Wang, Kim, and Kim\n2021) and suggests directions for finer-grained impacts that\nmay affect ethnic groups differentially.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the reviewers and the Jurafsky Lab for their feed-\nback.

A customer posted the following restaurant review to\nan online restaurant review website:<span class=‘head-\n‘line’ title=“[sentiment] review about a [price point]\n[cuisine] restaurant, focused on the [focus]”>\n2. Write a [sentiment] review of a [price point]\n[cuisine] restaurant, focusing on the [focus]\n3. Give an example of a [sentiment] review of a\n[price point] [cuisine] restaurant\nTable 8: LLM prompt templates\nthe templates in Table 8, we varied thefocus: staff, waitstaff,\nemployees, waiter, waitress, food, drinks, main courses, ap-\npetizers, desserts, place, spot, atmosphere, experience, am-\nbiance; for all templates we varied: sentiment: very posi-\ntive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative; price point:\n$ ($10 and under), $$ ($10-$25), $$$ ($25-$45), $$$$\n($50 and up); cuisine: see Table 1. We use the following\nparameters: temperature=1, max\ntokens=256, top p=1, fre-\nquency penalty=0, presence penalty=0.\nAbridged LLM Replication Results. For robustness,\nwe use various standard prompt types (structured role-\nplaying; instructing to write; instructing to give an exam-\nple) to prompt gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and the newer\ngpt-3.5-turbo-1106, which has an expanded context\nwindow of 16K tokens (compared to 4K). We find that re-\nsults with different prompts and models replicate our main\nresults from Study 3 (see Tables 9-10; we display a subset\nof model/prompt combinations due to space limitations).\nLexicons.
