  "abstract": "Green plums have produced significant economic benefits because of their nutritional and medicinal value. However, green plums are affected by factors such as plant diseases and insect pests during their growth, picking, transportation, and storage, which seriously affect the quality of green plums and their products, reducing their economic and nutritional value. At present, in the detection of green plum defects, some researchers have applied deep learning to identify their surface defects. However, the recognition rate is not high, the types of defects identified are singular, and the classification of green plum defects is not detailed enough. In the actual production process, green plums often have more than one defect, and the existing detection methods ignore minor defects. Therefore, this study used the vision transformer network model to identify all defects on the surfaces of green plums. The dataset was classified into multiple defects based on the four types of defects in green plums (scars, flaws, rain spots, and rot) and one type of feature (stem). After the permutation and combination of these defects, a total of 18 categories were obtained after the screening, combined with the actual situation. Based on the VIT model, a fine-grained defect detection link was added to the network for the analysis layer of the major defect hazard level and the detection of secondary defects. The improved network model has an average recognition accuracy rate of 96.21% for multiple defect detection of green plums, which is better than that of the VGG16 network, the Desnet121 network, the Resnet18 network, and the WideResNet50 network.",
