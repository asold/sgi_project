However, what is \nhappening in schools is not promising. Students’ \nperformance and interest in science are declining \n(Markow & Lonning, 1998) . Secondary school and \ncollege students’ knowledge of science is often \ncharacterized by lack of coherence and the majority of \nstudents engage in essentially rote learning (BouJaoude \n& Barakat, 2000, Brandt et al., 2001; Nakhleh, 1992). \nThe problem is twofold: The abstract and highly \nconceptual nature of science seems to be particularly \ndifficult for students and teaching methods and \ntechniques do not seem to make the learning process \nsufficiently easy for students (Gabel, 1999; Schmid & \nTelaro, 1990). \nThese problems are quite serious in chemistry, which \nis widely perceived as a difficult subject because of its \nspecialized language, mathematical and abstract \nconceptual nature, and the amount of content to be \nlearned (Gabel, 1999; Moore, 1989). The prevailing \nteaching practices do not actively involve students in the \nlearning process and seem to deprive them from taking \ncharge of their learning (Francisco, Nicoll, & \nTrautmann, 1998). Novak (1998) accentuated the need \nfor educators to take advantage of the available \nknowledge base of learning, learners, knowledge \nconstruction, and instructional tools to improve \nCorrespondence to: Saouma BouJaoude, Prof. Dr. Science \nEducation, Department of Education, American \nUniversity of Beirut, P.O. Box 11-0236, Beirut, \nLEBANON \nE-mail: boujaoud@aub.edu.lb \nS. BouJaoude & M. Attieh \n234 © 2008 EURASIA, Eurasia J. Math. Sci. & Tech. Ed., 4(3), 233-246 \n \n \neducational quality, a knowledge base that has not been \ntapped sufficiently.  \nImproving educational quality requires, at the least, \nplacing learners in active rather than passive roles \n(Moore, 1989). People learn by  being engaged actively, \nand a person is not an empty vessel to be filled with \ninformation. Knowledge that empowers and increases \nthe learner’s self-confidence is that which results from \nthe coming together of individual actions, feelings, and \nconscious thoughts (Nov ak, 1998). Rote memorization \ndisempowers learners and promotes fear of learning \nbecause it is irrelevant to their own experiences. In \naddition, information learned by rote in the absence of \nconnections with previously acquired frameworks is \nlargely forgotten (Novak, 1998). Thus, the goal of \neducation should be to develop educational experiences \nthat facilitate meaningful le arning and reduce the need \nfor rote learning. Ausubel (1968) describe s meaningful \nlearning as the establishment of non-arbitrary relations \namong concepts and sees that meaningful learning is \nachieved if learners choose to relate new information to \nideas they already know. Meaningful learning occurs if \nlearners have relevant prio r knowledge and meaningful \nlearning material and are willing to understand and apply \nthe effort needed to attain meaningful understanding \n(Novak, 1998). \nConcept Mapping \nAs the problem of improving the teaching/learning \nprocess preoccupies educators, concept mapping \npromises to be useful in enhancing meaningful learning. \nConcept maps help learners to make evident the key \nconcepts or propositions to be learned and suggest \nconnections between new and previous knowledge. \nConcept maps have been used in a variety of \neducational contexts. Each context reflects an \nalternative theory of knowledge acquisition. On the one \nhand, the rationalist theory of learning suggests that \ndisciplines have inherent structures that should be \nconveyed to learners. Theref ore, concept maps should \nbe evaluated by relating them to ideal maps, teacher-\nconstructed maps, or expert concept maps. On the \nother hand, constructivists highlight the uniqueness of \neach individual’s representation of concepts \n(Beyerebach & Smit h, 1990) leading them to devise \nvarious mechanisms to evaluate students’ concept maps. \nNevertheless, both theories concur that meaningful \nlearning occurs when concepts are organized in an \nindividual’s cognitive structure. \nConcept maps are flexible tools that can be used in a \nvariety of educational settings (Stewart, Van-Kirk, & \nRowell, 1979). For example, they can play a significant \nrole in curriculum development, learning, and teaching \n(Novak, 1984). Concept maps are useful in science \ncurriculum planning for separating significant from \ntrivial content (Starr & Kraj cik, 1990) and in focusing \nthe attention of curriculum designers on teaching \nconcepts and distinguishing the intended curriculum \nfrom instructional techniques that serve as vehicles for \nlearning (Stewart et al., 1979). Furthermore, concept \nmaps have been used as assessment tools to measure \nlearning outcomes different from those revealed in \ncommonly used psychometric instruments (Markham, \nMintzes, & Jones, 1994). However, Johnstone and Otis, \n(2006) suggested that “maps sh ould be treated as very \npersonal learning tools” and consequently, are not \nappropriate for assessment purposes. Finally, more \nrecent studies have used concept mapping to engender \nrelational conceptual change in college level chemistry \n(Liu, 2004).  \nIn an attempt to identify more conceptually based \nteaching and learning methods, research has investigated \nthe use of concept maps in many content areas such as \nbiology, physics, and chemistry. Stensvold and Wilson \n(1992) investigated the effect of students’ construction \nof concept mapping in high school chemistry \nlaboratories on their comprehension of chemical \nconcepts. No differences were found between the \nexperimental and control groups. In their turn, Nicoll, \nFrancisco, and Nakhleh (2001) investigated the effect of \nconstruction of concept maps on freshman chemistry \nstudents’ achievement and ability to link concepts. \nPositive results were achi eved for both variables. \nHorton et al. (1993) conducte d a meta-analysis study in \nwhich they found that ther e were many more studies \nusing concept mapping in biology than in physical \nsciences and that, although  results showed positive \neffects on attitude and achievement, these effects were \nmore obvious in the biological than the physical \nsciences. In addition, Horton et al. found that concept \nmaps were constructed mostly by students in class and \nthat there were no differences between males and \nfemales, even though previous research (e.g. Novak & \nMusonda, 1991) suggested otherwise.  \nAs seen above, research addressing the use of \nconcept maps in chemistry has been limited and has \nproduced inconclusive results. Moreover, there are \ndisagreements between researchers on the effectiveness \nof concept mapping in ch emistry teaching. Zoller \n(1990), for example, questio ns the effectiveness of \nconcept mapping in chemistry because many chemistry \nconcepts are abstract, nonintuitive, and not directly \ninterrelated. In contrast, No vak (1994) argues that the \nproblems are not due to the nature of chemistry; \nproblems rather arise from the fact that students learn \nchemistry by rote and do not recognize key concepts \nand their relationships. Moreover, Novak contends that \ninstruction fails to stress  chemical concepts and \nrelationships. Differing results could arise also from the \nfact that studies have focused on the use of concept \nmaps an instructional, cu rriculum development, and \nConcept Maps As Homework \n© 2008 EURASIA, Eurasia J. Math. Sci. & Tech. Ed., 4(3), 233-246 235 \n \n \nassessment tools but not as st udy tools, especially in \nhomework assignments.   \nMany students struggle to learn chemistry, but are \noften unsuccessful. It seems that many of them do not \nconstruct appropriate understandings of fundamental \nchemical concepts throughout their educational \nexperiences (Nakhleh, 1992). Instead of having well \nstructured and integrated domain-specific knowledge \nstructures, students consid er the different chemical \nconcepts as isolated elements of knowledge. This lack of \nintegration may be the main reason for difficulties in \nconcept formation and application of acquired \nknowledge (Brandt et al., 2 001). Thus, concept mapping \nas a method to build explicit links and relations between \nconcepts, as a study tool that I used as personal learning \ntool (Johnstone & Otis, 2 006), and as an opportunity \nfor students to construct maps using their own terms \n(Horton, et al., 1993), is ex pected to stimulate the \nconstruction of integrated knowledge structures leading \nstudents to achieve higher in tests that measure high \ncognitive levels. \nResearch has demonstrated that concept mapping is \na skill that requires time for mastery. However, a metal-\nanalysis conducted by Horton et al. (1993) has shown \nthat positive effects were achieved in studies than \nranged in length from 2 to 22 weeks, with an average \nduration of six weeks. As a study tool, concept mapping \nis most effective if it is used on an on-going basis over \nthe course of instruction. Thus, when students build \nconcept maps in homework assignments recurrently, \nthey will get the chance to re vise their understanding by \nmodifying their maps leading to better understanding. \nFurthermore, because of personal involvement and the \nability to revise offered by  homework assignments, \nconcept mapping is expected to help students overcome \ndifficulties with abstract and complex science concepts \nby integrating them into well-structured cognitive \nframeworks. \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this study was to answer the \nfollowing questions: \n1. Will Grade 10 students who construct concept \nmaps as homework have significantly higher grades on \nchemistry achievement school tests than Grade 10 \nstudents who do not construct such maps as \nhomework? \n2. Will the use of concept maps as homework with \nGrade 10 students have significantly different effects on \nstudents with different achievement levels? \n3. Will the use of concept maps as homework with \nGrade 10 students have significantly different effects on \nmales and females? \n4. Will there be a significant correlation between \nstudents’ mastery of concept mapping skill and their \nachievement in chemistry? \nMETHOD \nParticipants \nParticipants in this study were sixty Grade 10 \nchemistry students from a co-educational private high \nschool in Lebanon. They were randomly divided into \ntwo sections based on achievement, which is the school \npolicy. For the purposes of th e study, the sections were \nrandomly assigned to the experimental and control \ngroups.  \nInstruments \nChemistry Achievement Tests.  The dependent \nvariable in this study is the students’ chemistry \nachievement. Two tests were used to measure \nachievement. One of the tests measured students’ pre-\nrequisite knowledge in topics related to the ones \ncovered during the study (Appendix A presents \nexamples of the questions used in the pretest). The \nsecond test measured student achievement at the \nconclusion of the study (A ppendix B presents examples \nof the questions used in the posttest). \nAccording to Lehman, Cart er, and Kahle (1985) and \nWillerman and MacHarg (1991), a test must be at the \ncomprehension level and above in order to measure \nmeaningful learning. Consequently, many items on the \nachievement tests used in this study were at the \ncomprehension level or above. The pre-test assessed \nstudents’ achievement in solubility equilibrium. The \npost-test assessed students’ achievement in acid/base \ntitration and weak acids equilibrium. A table of \nspecifications was used guarantee that the items on the \ntwo tests represented the content. Moreover, a detailed \ndescription of the six levels of Blooms’ taxonomy \n(Bloom, 1969) was used to ma ke sure that the items \nwere at the different levels of Blooms taxonomy. Two \nscience education faculty members, a science teacher, \nand a chemistry education doctoral student were \nprovided with the objectives based on which the lesson \nplans and tests were designed along with a detailed \ndescription and examples of Bloom’s taxonomy and \nwere asked to classify the test items and match them \nwith the objectives. Differences in classification were \ndiscussed among the faculty members, teacher, and \ndoctoral student and the researcher in order to reach \nconsensus. The reliability (α\n) of the pretest was .83 while \nthat of the posttest was .84. The two researchers and the \nchemistry teacher of the control group corrected the \nachievement tests based on a detailed, agreed upon, \ncommon key. \nS. BouJaoude & M. Attieh \n236 © 2008 EURASIA, Eurasia J. Math. Sci. & Tech. Ed., 4(3), 233-246 \n \n \nConcept Map Scoring Rubric.  The researchers \ndeveloped an expert concep t map (Appendix C) and a \nscoring rubric (Appendix D) to monitor students when \nconstructing concept maps. The scoring rubric used in \nthis study combined the qualitative analysis of gross \nstructure and the quantitative analysis of links, in order \nto provide a valuable tool to highlight the key \ncharacteristics of concept maps. The qualitative “spoke-\nchain-net“ classification put forward by Kinchin, Hay, \nand Adams (2000) is able to describe the gross changes \nin a concept map which is indicative of radical \nrestructuring. In addition, the degree of valid cross-\nlinkage, the amount of branching, and the hierarchical \nstructure are included in the analysis because they reflect \nassociative and superordinate-subordinate categorical \nrelationships among concepts.  \nThe quantitative analysis of the concept maps \nconsisted of three dimens ions: The links’ validity, \nconvergence, and salience. McClure, Sonak and Suen \n(1999) showed that the most reliable scoring procedures \nare those that focus on the links in the map, the element \nwhich is most problematic to students but which reveals \na good deal about their depth of understanding. In the \nscoring rubric, each proposition is scored from zero to \nthree in accordance with the following scoring protocol: \nZero is assigned to invali d links, the links that were \nconstructed based on incorrect  scientific information. \nOne is assigned to the link that connects interrelated \nconcepts but that misses the label. Two is given to the \nlink that is scientifically correct and has a possible label \nindicated, but does not specify the direction. Three is \ngiven to the correctly labeled links with the directions \nspecified by an arrow.  \nConvergence measures the extent to which the \npossible links are actualized in the students’ maps. The \nconvergence score is computed as the number of the \nvalid links in a map divided by the number of all \npossible links as derived from the expert map. Finally, \nsalience measures the abundance of valid links. Salience \nis computed as the number of valid links divided by the \nnumber of all links in a student’s map. \nProcedure \nThe treatment took place during the third term of \nthe school year. The students were pre-tested using a \nteacher-constructed chemistry achievement pretest \n(Appendix A). The study exte nded over six weeks. The \nclass met five times per week for fifty minutes daily. The \nmaterial covered was acid base titration and weak acid \nequilibrium. At the end of the treatment period, the \nstudents were post-tested (Appendix B). Study \nparticipants were randomly assigned to two sections \nbased on overall achievement. A different teacher taught \neach section. One teacher taught the experimental group \nin which students were trained to construct concept \nmaps as homework while a different teacher taught the \ncontrol group in which students covered the same \nchemistry content with regular exercises assigned as \nhomework. It is important to note that the school is \nwhich the study was conducted belongs to a worldwide \nnetwork of schools that has adopted standardized \ncurricula, teaching and asse ssment methods, and pacing \ncharts on which all teachers are trained extensively \nbefore joining any of the schools in the network. \nConsequently, both teachers followed a teaching pacing \nchart which contained a detailed description of the \ncontent and teaching methods to use in each period. \nThese charts are establishe d at the beginning of the \nsemester to insure that teachers cover the same material \nand use the same teaching and assessment \nmethodologies. Moreover, the average achievement of \nthe two sections was equivalent during the first semester \nof the academic year during which the study was \nconducted. Finally, the tests used before the start of the \nstudy consisted of high-order thinking skill questions as \nper school policy. \nThe treatment period was divided into two parts. \nThe first part consisted of one week during which the \nexperimental group students were trained to construct \nconcept maps. One preliminar y session was assigned at \nthe beginning of the week to introduce concept \nmapping, then an example of a concept map was \nprovided followed by guided practice. For the rest of \nthe week students in the experimental group were \naccorded, towards the end of each session, some time to \npractice the construction of concept maps using a \nconcept list provided by the teacher. The concept lists \nwere related to the material taught in class, they included \nchemistry concepts known to students in order to help \nthem focus on learning the process of concept mapping. \nStudents received feedback on their concept maps. \nDuring the second week, students in the \nexperimental group were required to construct concept \nmaps using concept lists identified in class. These \nconcept maps were scored using the researcher scoring \nrubric developed by the researchers and turned back the \nnext day to the students. The scored maps included \ndetailed feedback to help students improve their \nconcept mapping skills. At the end of the second week, \nthe second part of the treatment started and the \nexperimental and control groups started the acid-base \ntitration chapter, which took four more weeks to \ncomplete. During this 4-week period students in the \nexperimental group were required to submit twice per \nweek a concept map constructed by using the concepts \ntaught in class. The teacher did not provide the list of \nconcepts to the students. St udents in the control group \ncompleted traditional homework assignments during the \nsix weeks of the study. These assignments were scored \nand students were provided with detailed feedback. At \nthe end of the treatment period, both the experimental \nConcept Maps As Homework \n© 2008 EURASIA, Eurasia J. Math. Sci. & Tech. Ed., 4(3), 233-246 237 \n \n \nand control group students took the post-test at the \nsame time. \nRESULTS \nPre-Test \nThe mean score of the pretest for the experimental \ngroup was found to be 30.66, while that of the control \ngroup was found to be 29.28 out of a maximum \npossible score of 45. A t-test for independent samples \nshowed that there were no significant differences \nbetween the two groups (t = 0.68, p > 0.05).  \nPost-Test \nBecause there were no significant differences on the \npretest, it was assumed that the two groups started out \nwith equivalent means. Table 1 presents the means and \nstandard deviations of the posttest results for the \ncontrol and experimental groups. These results include \nthe scores on the knowledge (K-post), comprehension \n(C-post), and application-and-above (App-post) level \nquestions along with the total scores on the chemistry \nachievement post-test (Tot-post). The maximum \npossible scores are as follows: Knowledge level \nquestions = 11, comprehension level questions = 7, \napplication Level-and-ab ove questions = 22, and \nchemistry achievement post-test = 40. \nA t-test for independent samples was carried out to \ntest whether the experimental and control groups \ndiffered significantly on the post-test achievement in \nchemistry (Tot-post). No significant differences were \nfound (t = 1.55, p > 0.05). In addition, a t-test for \nindependent samples was carried out to test whether the \nscores of the experimental and control groups differed \nsignificantly on the questions at different cognitive \nlevels. A significant diff erence was found for the \nquestions at the knowledge level (k-post) (t = 1.97, p < \n0.05) on which the experimental group scored 8% \nhigher than the control group. No significant \ndifferences were found at the comprehension level (t = \n1.75, p > 0.05) and applicati on-and-above level (t = \n1.07, p > 0.05). Results are shown in Table 1. \nNevertheless, Table 1 shows that the scores of the \nexperimental group were consistently higher than those \nof the control group while the standard deviations were \nconsistently lower. \n \nTable 1.

Table 4 shows that there was a \nsignificant interaction between group and sex at the \nknowledge level. To find the sources of the interaction, \nthe means of males and fema les on the knowledge level \npost-test questions were calculated for the control and \nexperimental groups (Table 5). Table 5 shows that while \nthe females’ scores in the control group were lower than \nthose of the males’, their scores increased more \nsignificantly then those of the males.

To \nfind the sources of the interaction, the means of males \nand females on the comprehension level post-test scores \nwere calculated for the cont rol and experimental groups \n(Table 7). Table 7 shows that while the scores of the \nfemales in the control group were lower than those of \nthe males; their scores increa sed more significantly then \nthose of the males. The mean of the females in the \nexperimental group was 28.4% higher than that of the \nfemales in the control grou p, while the mean of the \nmales increased by 1.5%. Finally, there was no \nsignificant interaction between group and sex at the \napplication level scores (Table 8).  \nGroup - Achievement Level Interactions. \nStudents in the experimental and control groups were \nreassigned to one of two achievement levels based on \nthe Tot-pre scores. Students who scored below the \nmean on the chemistry pre-test were assigned to one \nachievement level (Achlevel I-pre) and students who \nscored above the mean were assigned to another \nachievement level (Achlevel II-pre). Consequently, a \ncomparison was carried out to see whether there were \ndifferences between the means for different \nachievement levels and groups on the total scores of the \nchemistry achievement pre-test. Table 9 shows that the \nmean of the Achlevel I-pre in the experimental group is \nvery close to that in the control group. While the mean \nof the Achlevel II-pre in the control group is only 2% \nhigher than that in the experimental group. Note that \n59% (17 out of 29) of the st udents in the experimental \ngroup scored above the mean (Achlevel II-pre), while in \nthe control group only 45% (13 out of 29) scored above \nthe mean. \nOther analyses were performed to check the effect \nof using concept maps as homework tools on the \nachievement level of the stud ents in the posttest. Based \non the Tot-post scores, students in the experimental and \ncontrol groups were reassigned to one of two \nachievement levels. Students who scored below the \nmean on the chemistry post-test were assigned to one \nachievement level (Achlevel I-post) and students who \nscored above the mean were assigned to another \nachievement level (Achlevel II-post). Consequently, \nmeans were compared to see whether there were \ndifferences between the means for different \nachievement levels and groups on the total scores of the \nchemistry achievement post-test. Results are shown in \nTable 10, which shows that the mean of the Achlevel I \nin the experimental group is 8% higher than that in the \ncontrol group. While the mean of the Achlevel II-post \nin the control group is 5% higher than that in the \nexperimental group. Note that 68% (19 out of 28) of the \nstudents in the experimen tal group scored above the \nmean (Achlevel II-post) while in the control group only \n47% (14 out of 30) scored above the mean. \nAnother comparison of the means was performed to \ncheck whether there were difference in achievement for \nthe experimental and control groups in the two \nachievement level groups, at the knowledge, \ncomprehension, and application-and- above level \nquestions in the post-test respectively (Tables 11,12, and \n13). Table 11 presents the results of the analysis at the \nknowledge level. Table 11 shows that students in \nAchlevel II in the experimental group scored 5.4% \nhigher than those in the control group on the \nknowledge level questions. In addition, Achlevel I in the \nexperimental group scored 4.0% higher than those in \nthe control group on the knowledge level questions. \nTable 12 presents the results of the mean scores \ncomparison at the comprehension level. The means of \nAchlevel I and Achlevel II at the comprehension level \nwere calculated for both control and experimental \ngroups (Table 12). Table 12 shows that the mean of the \nAchlevel I in the experimental group is 21.5% higher \nthan that in the control group while the mean of the \nAchlevel II in the control group is 7% higher than that \nin the experimental group. Note that the number of \nstudents who scored above the mean (Achlevel II) in \nthe experimental group (19 out of 29) is larger than that \nof the students who scored above the mean (Achlevel \nII) in the control group (14 out of 30). \nTable 13 represents the results of the comparison of \nscores at the application-and above level questions. The \nmeans of Achlevel I and Achlevel II group scores at the \napplication -and-above level were calculated for both \ncontrol and experimental groups. Analysis of these \nresults shows that the Achlevel I group mean in the \nexperimental group is 8% larger than that of the control \ngroup while the mean of the Achlevel II in the control \ngroup is 8% higher than that in the experimental group. \n \nS.

The experimental group students’ \nchemistry test scores were correlated with the \ncorresponding concept map subscores on salience, \nconvergence, and Total on the last concept map \nconstructed by the students (Concept Map No. 4 ). \nResults are shown in Table 14, which shows that the \nsalience score did not show significant correlation with \nany of the scores. \nThe convergence scores, however, showed a \nsignificant correlation with the scores on the \napplication-and-above level questions and the total \nscores and showed non-significant correlations with the \nknowledge and comprehension levels. Finally, the total \nscores on the concept map, showed a significant \ncorrelation with the scores on the application-and-above \nlevel questions and the total scores and non-significant \ncorrelations with the knowledge and comprehension \nlevels. It is worth noting that a high CMSal score means \nthat the student concept map includes a high number of \ncorrect propositions. A high CMConv score means that \nthe student concept map is close to the expert concept \nmap. A high CMTot score means that the student \nincluded in his or her concept map a larger number of \ndirectional correct propositions.  \nDISCUSSION \nUsing concept maps as homework tools was \nexpected to result in higher  achievement in chemistry. \nThis expectation was based on the assumption that \nusing concept maps helps organize information, fosters \nmetacognition, and engages students in building their \nknowledge structures.  \nResults showed that the mean score of the chemistry \nachievement post-test for the experimental group \nexceeded that of the control group; however the \ndifferent was not statistica lly significant. Further \nanalyses investigated the interaction between sex and \nthe effect of using concept mapping as a homework \ntool. There were no significant interactions between sex \nand the intervention at the application-and-above level. \nHowever, concept mapping favored girls over boys in \nthe total scores in the chemistry achievement test and \nwhen knowledge and comprehension level questions \nwere considered.  \nThe significant interacti ons between using concept \nmaps and gender can be interpreted in light of the \ncognitive style theory that categorizes males and females \ninto different learning styles. According to Wapner \n(1986), males are field-inde pendent learners while \nfemales are field-dependent learners. Field independent \nindividuals, such as males, use active reasoning patterns \nthat include cognitive structuring skills, while field \ndependent individuals, such as females, accept reality \nand may become passive learners. The concept mapping \ntechnique, used as a homework tool, presented students \nwith a novel experience in which structure was absent \nand involved them in an active process of identifying \nlinks between concepts, leading to the inference that the \nconcept mapping should favo r males over females, but \nthis is not the case in this study.  \nAt a first glance, the results of this study might seem \nto contradict the conclusions derived from cognitive \nstyle theory. However, a closer look at the results may \nprovide some clarification. On the one hand, studies \nhave shown that concept map construction is difficult \n(Lehman et al., 1985) and that  students need excessive \ntraining to master the concept mapping technique \n(Beyerebach & Smith, 1990; Brandt et al., 2001). Thus, it \nis possible the learning style of females would enable \nthem, more so than males, to master the new technique \nof building the concept map. The field-dependent \nlearners (females) must have been more conforming to \nteachers’ demands and more consistent in their work \nthan the field-independent learners (males) in following \nthe instructions to master the technique of building the \nconcept map. Consequently, because mastery is crucial \nfor deriving benefit from concept mapping (Beyerebach \n& Smith, 1990; Brandt et al., 2001), students who \nconformed to teachers’ demands benefited more from \nusing concept maps as homework tools.  \nOther analyses dealt with the differential effect of \nusing concept maps on high- and low-achieving \nstudents. Achievement leve l interactions were not \ndetected at the knowledge le vel. However, significant \ninteractions were achieved at the comprehension and \napplication-and-above levels. In addition, a significant \ninteraction was found when the total scores were \nconsidered. The means of achievement level group I \n(Achlevel I-post -- studen ts who scored below the \nmean) in the experimental group were higher than those \nin the control group for the comprehension level \nquestions, the application-and-above level questions, \nand for the total scores. These results showed that \nconcept mapping helped students who scored below the \ntest scores mean (achievement level group I) to achieve \nbetter on high cognitive level questions.  \nWhat deserves attention is that the means of \nachievement level group II in the experimental group on \nthe post-test (Achlevel II-post) at the comprehension \nand application-and-above level questions and at the \ntotal scores, were slightly lower than those in the control \ngroup. The differences between the experimental and \ncontrol group means, for the achievement level group \nII, were not significant for the comprehension level and \ntotal scores. However, the achievement level group II \nS. BouJaoude & M. Attieh \n242 © 2008 EURASIA, Eurasia J. Math. Sci. & Tech. Ed., 4(3), 233-246 \n \n \nstudents in the control group scored higher, at the \napplication-and-above level que stions, than those in the \nexperimental grou p with. Stensvold and Wilson (1992) \ngot similar results in their two studies with grade 9 and \nhigh school students. Among students with high \nabilities, those who construc ted concept maps scored \nlower on the comprehension test than those who did \nnot construct maps. However, among students with \nlower abilities, those who constructed concept maps \nscored higher than those who did not. Stensvold and \nWilson suggested that concept maps might have \ndisadvantaged high ability students because they might \nhave had there own successful strategies which were not \napplied when they used concept maps.  \nThe correlation between the chemistry total post-test \nscores and the concept map subscores, (Salience, \nConvergence, and Total) indicated that students who \nmastered concept-mapping sk ills performed better on \nhigh cognitive level questions. These results are in \nagreement with Novak’s ( 1994, 1998) description of \nmeaningful learning as the establishment of non-\narbitrary relations among concepts in the learners’ \nminds. Moreover, it highlights the importance of \nchemistry instruction that emphasizes identifying key \nconcepts and stresses on teaching concepts and their \nrelationships (Novak, 1994). Th us, it can be concluded \nthat concept mapping involved students who mastered \nconcept mapping in actively relating new information to \nprior knowledge resulting in meaningful learning and \nconsequently higher achievement. This situation, \nhowever, does not suggest that concept mapping is a \nsolution for all problems in learning chemistry because, \nas Zoller (1990) suggests, there are chemistry concepts \nthat are abstract, nonintuitive, and not directly \ninterrelated and cannot be taught by using concept \nmapping. \nCONCLUSION \nThe results of the study support using concept \nmapping as homework to engage students in \nconstructing and altering their own knowledge \nstructures, with the understanding that there is a need to \nhelp males become more engaged in using the technique \nbecause of its possible benefits. In addition, concept \nmaps were successful tools in helping low achievers \nimprove their grades. Nevertheless, concept mapping \nmay become effective for high achievers too if they are \nencouraged to periodically check their maps during the \nlearning process. Moreover, there is a need for longer \ntraining sessions and direct feedback to give learners the \nopportunity to master concept mapping the technique.  \nWhile promising, the resu lts of this and others \nstudies on using concept maps are not conclusive. \nConsequently, more research should be conducted to \ntest further the effect of concept mapping as homework \nwith a larger number of students, in different types of \nschools, and for different age groups. Other areas for \nfurther investigation include the amount of time needed \nto reap the benefits of using concept maps in a \nclassroom setting and the possible benefits derived from \nusing computers in the process. \nREFERENCES \nAAAS (1989 ).
