Introduction\nAccording to the International Energy Agency’s (IEA,2024) analysis of global energy trends, heat pumps\nare identified by major economies as one of the six key technologies for establishing their position in the\ngrowing clean energy economy, with market size and trade volume projected to surge over the next\ndecade. Furthermore, it is highlighted that space heating, space cooling, and water heating constitute a\nsubstantial share of energy demand in buildings.\nIn this study, we focus on the broader category of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)\nsystems, which includes heat pumps. Our research objective is to reduce energy consumption through\neffective building of HV AC control and operation, while simultaneously ensuring comfortable indoor\nenvironments for occupants.\nResearch by Li and Wen (2014) on energy modeling for buildings with large-scale HVAC systems\nindicates that HVAC accounts for approximately 30% of total building energy consumption. Their survey,\nfocusing on control and operation strategies, underscores the significance of HV AC as a primary target for\nenergy savings. Moreover, research by Park and Nagy (2018) reveals that buildings are responsible for\nabout 30–40% of global energy demand. They observed that many studies on building control systems\nprimarily focus on energy conservation, often placing less emphasis on thermal comfort control,\nparticularly concerning occupant satisfaction. Concerning comfort, Kong et al. (2022) quantitatively\nevaluated the performance of occupancy-based control strategies in commercial buildings. Their findings\nshowed that such strategies can maintain good thermal comfort and perceived indoor air quality, achieving\noccupant satisfaction rates exceeding 80%. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis conducted by Rahif et al.\n(2022) revealed that the choice of HVAC strategy, along with heating and cooling setpoints, are the most\ninfluential factors determining the primary energy consumption of HVAC systems. Kim et al. (2018)\nproposed a Personal Comfort Model leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and machine learning.\nThis model learns individual comfort requirements directly from data gathered in everyday environments\nto predict personal thermal comfort responses.\nThe most recent year has witnessed a surge in the development of generative AI, particularly in the field\nof large language models (LLMs). As LLMs boast an ever-increasing number of parameters, their\ngeneralization capabilities have significantly improved not only texts but also images, audios, videos,\nand so on, which is the so-called Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) (Xu et al.,2023). The\napplication of generative AI has expanded beyond language processing to encompass multimodal\ninformation, leading to its adoption in various fields, including robotics, health care, education, and\nbusiness (Singh et al.,2022; Wang et al.,2022; Driess et al.,2023; Moor et al.,2023; Wu et al.,2023).\nFurthermore, Agentic AI is emerging. Given a goal set by humans, these AI systems break it down into\nsmaller subtasks, plan the execution steps, and execute them sequentially to achieve the goal, thereby\nbehaving as if they are thinking and acting autonomously (Acharya et al.,2025).\nNotably, the research by Driess et al. (2023) has made a significant impact by enabling the direct\nincorporation of raw data from robotic actuators as language into generative AI models. This advance-\nment has resulted in models capable of achieving high inference accuracy in specific use cases, even\nwithout being explicitly trained on task-specific data. For instance, research has demonstrated the use of\nLLMs for educational purposes in data science, encompassing tasks from data preprocessing to explora-\ntory data analysis and report generation, even without task-specific training data in certain use cases\n(Tu et al.,2024). Furthermore, a study comparing the performance of GPT-4 by OpenAI (2023) to humans\nin data analysis tasks has shown that GPT-4 alone can achieve a level of proficiency comparable to a mid-\nlevel data scientist (Cheng et al.,2023). This inherent generalization ability of unsupervised models\ntotally reduces extensive labeled datasets and annotation costs that are traditionally required for super-\nvised deep learning, thereby expanding the benefits of generative AI across various industries.\nThe field of HV AC systems exemplifies this potential. Previous research in HVAC optimization has\nfocused on improving comfort based on human feedback (Rajith et al.,2018) or using surveillance\ncameras to analyze clothing and predict thermal comfort for control learning techniques (Choi et al.,\n2022). However, relying solely on feedback poses challenges in managing large spaces due to the\ne31-2 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nsubjective nature of individual comfort preferences. In addition, employing surveillance cameras raises\nprivacy concerns, and inferring individual comfort solely from clothing insulation proves inadequate. To\naddress these challenges, recent studies have investigated the feasibility of employing the generalization\ncapabilities of LLMs for controlling industrial equipment (Ahn et al.,2023; Song et al.,2023b). A notable\nexample involves using GPT-4 for simulation-based HVAC control, where the model predicts the desired\ncooling or heating level, achieving performance comparable to reinforcement learning approaches on\nsimulations, which limits its real-world applicability (Song et al.,2023b). Similarly, another study\ndemonstrated that ChatGPT, when integrated into a virtual office building simulation model for HVAC\ncontrol, could achieve a 16.8% reduction in energy consumption through zero-shot inference (Ahn et al.,\n2023). However, these studies relied on simulations and did not incorporate real-world complexities.\nOur goal is to optimize the office environment using generative AI. We tackled a classic trade-off:\nincreasing occupant comfort typically leads to higher HVAC energy consumption, while reducing energy\nconsumption often compromises comfort. The key question we investigated was whether we could\nresolve this trade-off using multimodal generative AI and Agentic AI without Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) or fine-tuning.\nWe sensed various environmental parameters (e.g., indoor/outdoor temperature, illuminance, over-\nhead layout, occupant location) from an office and collected feedback from office workers regarding their\nthermal comfort by conducting a real-world experiment in the actual office setting. This real-time data,\nalong with historical environmental data, were compiled as prompts for the generative AI model. The\nmodel was tasked with predicting optimal HVAC setpoint temperatures for different times of the day,\nconsidering the current and historical environmental conditions and human comfort feedback. We\nevaluated the performance of our system by comparing the electricity consumption of the HV AC system\nunder the control of the generative AI model to that of the baseline system over an extended period. We\naim to explore the applicability of our system to larger-scale building energy management scenarios, such\nas data centers and industrial facilities, where energy consumption is a critical concern. This study bridges\nthe gap between simulation-based LLM applications and real-world HVAC control by implementing and\nevaluating a contribution significant to overall energy usage, as following our contributions:\n we conducted a field experiment in the actual office setting, gathering diverse environmental data\n(e.g., indoor/outdoor temperature, illuminance, overhead layout, occupant location) through sensors\nand incorporating historical data as prompts for the generative AI model.\n we collected subjective feedback from office workers regarding their comfort levels. This valuable\ninformation on human perception was fed into the generative AI model, allowing it to consider\nhuman factors in its predictions.\n our findings demonstrate a remarkable reduction of up to 47.92% in actual power consumption\ncompared to the baseline. The comfort of office workers improved by up to 26.36%.\n we propose Data-Driven Reasoning for Agentic AI, which enables stable prediction of optimal\nHVAC temperatures and operating statuses even with a limited number of inference steps.\nThis article is organized as follows:Section 2provides a detailed survey of related technical elements and\nclarifies their relationship to this research.Section 3describes a case study applying the baseline research,\nupon which our study is built, to a real-world office setting, and provides an overview of our proposed\nmethod. Section 4details the prompt engineering techniques employed in our experiments and describes\nthe experimental design.Section 5presents a multi-faceted analysis based on the experimental data to\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.Section 6presents an ablation study investigating the\npredictive and explanatory capabilities of the generative AI, based on the experimental data.Section 7\ndelves into the critical factors, real-world applicability, and prospects for scaling the proposed technique\nwithin existing building infrastructures. Finally,Section 8 concludes the article by summarizing the\nresearch and discussing future directions for generative AI in equipment control.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-3\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2. Related works\n2.1. HVAC control for building system\nControlling building systems is a complex challenge due to the influence of fluctuating factors like\nweather and occupant behavior, making accurate predictions difficult. This is particularly true for HVAC\nsystems, where Model Predictive Control (MPC) has long been explored for its optimization potential.\nRecent years have seen a surge in interest toward intelligent buildings that leverage weather and\ntemperature forecasts to further optimize HVAC control, as demonstrated in several studies (Afram\nand Janabi-Sharifi,2014; Carli et al.,2020; Yao and Shekhar,2021; Blum et al.,2022; Hou et al.,2022;\nTaheri et al., 2022). For instance, Taheri et al. (2022) provide a comprehensive review of recent\nadvancements in MPC techniques, outlining guidelines for optimal design. Carli et al. (2020) bridge\nthe gap between theory and practice by proposing an IoT-based architecture for implementing MPC in\nreal-world HVAC systems. Furthermore, Blum et al. (2022) demonstrated the practical implementation of\nMPC in a real office building using an open-source Modelica-based toolchain, achieving a 40% reduction\nin HVAC energy consumption over a 2-month trial while analyzing practical challenges and implemen-\ntation effort. Addressing the inherent uncertainties in weather forecasting, Hou et al. (2022) introduce an\nerror model based on easily measurable data to enhance MPC performance. They proposed an error model\nincorporating readily available data to improve MPC performance under weather forecast uncertainty,\nachieving a 3.4% energy cost reduction and a 73% decrease in room temperature deviations compared to\nrule-based control. Previous studies have highlighted the potential of MPC for energy-saving in building\nsystems, particularly in HVAC. Yao and Shekhar (2021) reviewed MPC applications in buildings,\nemphasizing their ability to handle uncertain parameters like weather forecasting, ambient temperature,\nand solar radiation. Afram and Janabi-Sharifi (2014) compared MPC with other control methods,\nhighlighting its advantages in improving energy efficiency and maintaining indoor comfort. They\ndemonstrated the potential for pre-heating or pre-cooling buildings during off-peak periods to reduce\nelectricity costs.\nWhile MPC has shown promise, predicting building system behavior remains challenging due to\ninherent uncertainties. Researchers have explored occupant comfort prediction as a proxy for building\nperformance (Rajith et al.,2018; Choi et al.,2022; Skaloumpakas et al.,2023). Choi et al. (2022)\ndeveloped a deep learning model for real-time clothing insulation (R-CLO) estimation, demonstrating its\npotential for comfort-aware HVAC control by predicting energy consumption based on clothing and\nimpacting thermal comfort assessed using the Predicted Mean V ote (PMV) index. Rajith et al. (2018)\nachieved a 20–40% energy consumption reduction during summer by automating HVAC control based on\nuser feedback, sensor data, and a neural network/multi-layered perceptron (MLP) for time series\nprediction, prioritizing user comfort by minimizing unnecessary feedback requests. Skaloumpakas\net al. (2023) proposed a neural network model to overcome PMV limitations in accurately reflecting\nperceived comfort by integrating user feedback and temperature sensor data, predicting next-hour internal\nand external temperatures to improve comfort prediction.\nHowever, implementing room-specific MPC models across entire buildings presents significant\nchallenges, including high cost and data acquisition complexities. The rise of generative AI, particularly\nunsupervised learning models, offers a potential solution by eliminating the need for extensive training\ndata. This breakthrough could significantly reduce data collection and annotation costs, paving the way\nfor wider adoption in industry.\n2.2. Generative AI potentials as a simulator\nBuilding system prediction necessitates expertise in computer science and mathematics, including data\nscience and statistics. For effective HVAC control, generative AI’s ability to predict and regress based on\nvarious sensor inputs becomes crucial. Recent studies have explored the potential of LLMs for automating\ndata science and statistical analysis. Tu et al. (2024) demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in data\nanalysis tasks, including data cleaning, analysis, and report generation, while also highlighting their\npotential as expert tutors for enhancing data science and programming learning outcomes. Specifically,\ne31-4 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\ntheir evaluation showed LLMs could perform these tasks with high quality. Cheng et al. (2023)\ninvestigated GPT-4’s capabilities as a data analyst, employing various databases to perform end-to-end\nautomated data analysis and comparing its performance with human data scientists. Their findings\nrevealed that GPT-4 possesses moderate to advanced data science skills but lags behind humans in tasks\ninvolving graphical analysis. Imani et al. (2023) explored the limitations of LLMs in solving arithmetic\nreasoning tasks, where a single correct answer exists. They demonstrated that using zero-shot Chain-of-\nThought (CoT) prompting enhances LLM performance in finding mathematical predictions and solu-\ntions. Zhu et al. (2024) investigated LLMs’ understanding of the fundamental mathematical concept of\nnumbers. They concluded that LLMs maintain a compressed internal representation of numbers, making\naccurate reconstruction difficult but suggesting partial understanding. Raj et al. (2022) highlighted the\nsensitivity of pre-trained LLMs to prompt variations, even when the prompts are semantically similar,\nleading to significant differences in output. Their research proposed a metric for assessing the consistency\nof LLM outputs, showing a strong correlation with human evaluation.\nLLMs are actively being researched as simulators for decision-making across various fields, including\nautonomous driving, robotics, agent-based control, and social simulation. In autonomous driving, LLMs\nsimulate vehicle trajectories and predict actions like lane changes based on sensor data (Mao et al.,2023;\nSha et al.,2023; Fu et al.,2024). Robotics research utilizes LLMs for environment-aware decision-\nmaking, translating ambiguous natural language instructions into precise reward functions, and voice\ncontrol (Cui et al.,2023; Gramopadhye and Szafir,2023; Salzmann et al.,2023). Other studies are also\ninvestigating the automatic optimization of simulator parameters using LLMs to automatically derive\nreward functions (Yu et al.,2023; Ma et al.,2024). For predicting real-world behavior, LLMs are being\nemployed to simulate social interactions observed in media and to model human actions and decision-\nmaking processes (Park et al.,2022; Song et al.,2023a; Gui and Toubia,2024).\n2.3. LLM-driven agents and world-modeling\nAgentic AI, a current focus of research, is characterized by its ability to autonomously manage all\nprocesses required to achieve a human-specified goal. This encompasses breaking down complex tasks,\nplanning execution sequences, executing individual tasks, evaluating outcomes against the goal, and,\ncrucially, interacting with the external environment. This interaction may involve generating and\nexecuting code, collecting and analyzing information fromSupplementary Materials, and utilizing\nexternal APIs. The significant versatility of Agentic AI is driving discussion about its associated benefits\nand risks. Acharya et al. (2025) provide a comprehensive overview of Agentic AI, covering its\ncharacteristics, methodologies, applications (e.g., health care, finance, and manufacturing), and chal-\nlenges (e.g., scalability, ethics, and regulation). It highlights the transformative potential of Agentic AI’s\nautonomous decision-making while emphasizing the need for ongoing research in areas like goal\nalignment, multi-agent coordination, and ethical considerations. Li et al. (2023) developed ModelScope-\nAgent, a customizable, general-purpose agent system leveraging open-source LLMs. This system\ndemonstrates improved API call accuracy through a novel training strategy and provides a flexible\nframework for building real-world applications using over 1000 public AI models. Shavit et al. (2023)\ndiscuss the potential benefits and risks of Agentic AI, including increased efficiency and tailored\nrecommendations, alongside potential harms. It proposes actionable practices for users, developers,\nand implementers, such as task appropriateness evaluation, action space constraints, and activity\nmonitoring, to mitigate risks and address societal impacts. Sivakumar (2024) explores the application\nof Agentic AI to enhance Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) platforms, focusing on\npredictive analytics, machine learning, and autonomous decision-making to improve operational effi-\nciency and resource allocation. It highlights the potential for real-time resource optimization and\ndiscusses challenges related to ethics, data security, and the transition to self-governing systems.\nResearch has increasingly shown that agents can be successfully trained to learn world models,\nresulting in significant generalization capabilities across diverse tasks. The potential for transfer to real-\nworld applications makes this approach particularly attractive for industry. A world model is a learned\nData-Centric Engineering e31-5\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nrepresentation that approximates the structure of the world based on limited observational data from a\nspecific environment. This learned representation supports the inference of causal factors from observa-\ntions and allows for the prediction of future or unseen events based on those factors. West et al. (2024)\ninvestigate the“Generative AI Paradox,” where generative models exhibit strong output generation but\nweaker understanding. Through analysis of language and vision modalities, they demonstrate that\ngenerative capability does not necessarily depend on understanding, suggesting a structural difference\nbetween generative AI and human intelligence. Dinu et al. (2024) introduce SymbolicAI, a logic-based\nframework for concept learning and flow management in LLMs, addressing the issue of hallucination. By\ntreating LLMs as semantic parsers, SymbolicAI integrates generative models with symbolic reasoning,\nproviding a foundation for research in areas like program synthesis and autonomous agent design. Wang\net al. (2024) propose Generative Simulation, a new paradigm for robot skill learning, and introduces\nRoboGen, a generative robot agent. RoboGen uses a self-guided cycle of proposing skills, generating\nsimulation environments, and autonomously acquiring those skills, demonstrating a broader range of task\nand skill generation compared to traditional human-created datasets. Ha and Schmidhuber (2018)\nconstruct a generative neural network, termed a World Model, for reinforcement learning, enabling\nagents to learn and plan actions within a learned representation of the environment. This model comprises\na Vision Model (V), a Memory RNN (M), and a Controller (C), allowing for efficient learning and transfer\nof policies to real-world environments, surpassing traditional deep Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nmethods. Hafner et al. (2020) propose Dreamer, a reinforcement learning agent that learns long-term\nbehaviors by backpropagating value gradients through imagined trajectories in the latent space of a\nlearned Recurrent State Space Model (RSSM). Dreamer achieves superior data efficiency and perform-\nance compared to both model-free and model-based approaches on visual control tasks. Hafner et al.\n(2021) introduce DreamerV2, the first world-model-based reinforcement learning agent to achieve\nhuman-level performance on the Atari benchmark. Key improvements over the original Dreamer include\nthe use of categorical latent states and Kullback–Leibler (KL) balancing in the world model, enabling\nmore effective representation learning. Hafner et al. (2023) present DreamerV3, a scaled-up and\ngeneralized reinforcement learning agent that achieves significant advancements in autonomous learning,\nincluding solving the Minecraft diamond collection task without human demonstrations. DreamerV3’s\nimprovements in decision-making, stability, and scalability open new possibilities for real-world\nreinforcement learning applications, including learning from diverse data sources.\nDrawing inspiration from recent examples of Agentic AI, we propose that the inherent simulation\ncapabilities of these agents, specifically their internal representations of the environment, can function as a\nworld model. This article details an experimental investigation to test this hypothesis. We collected\nobservations of an office environment using IoT sensors and feedback from occupants. An Agentic AI\nwas then employed toinfer the optimal HVAC setpoints that would maintain a comfortable environment\nwhile minimizing energy usage. We rigorously evaluated the accuracy of the Agentic AI’s predictions in\napproximating the real office environment, employing both mathematical expressions and supporting\nrationales.\n2.4. Multimodal foundation models\nBeyond language, research is rapidly advancing in multimodal generative AI, which processes inputs and\noutputs across multiple modalities, including images, audio, video, 3D models, and robotic sensor data\n(Fei et al.,2022; Yang et al.,2023b; GeminiTeam,2024b; Liang et al.,2024; Yang et al.,2024b; Qin et al.,\n2025). Fei et al. (2022) developed a foundational model pre-trained on large-scale multimodal data,\nd e m o n s t r a t i n gp r o m i s i n gr e s u l t si na d a p t i n gt ov a rious tasks with a single model. MFMs are believed to\nimprove model explainability and enhance imagination capabilities. Liang et al. (2024)p r e s e n t e da\ncomprehensive survey of MFMs, classifying various approaches for handling multimodal inputs and\noutputs across diverse tasks and providing an overview of current trends in the field. Such MFMs have\nbecome commercially available and are being adopted at a remarkable pace (GeminiTeam,2024b).\ne31-6 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nYang et al. (2023b) proposed enhancing LLMs’ capabilities through visual marker input, demonstrating\nthat GPT-4V can understand visual markers on images, enabling visual reference-based prompting and\ninspiring this study’s approach to incorporating image information for captioning tasks. Furthermore,\nYang et al. (2023a) introduced Set-of-Marks (SoM), a novel visual prompting method for large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) like GPT-4V, which divides input images into regions with varying\ngranularity and uses alphabet, numbers, masks, or boxes as marks to enhance GPT-4V’s recognition\nabilities. OpenAI’s Sora is a general-purpose visual model trained on video data, capable of generating\nhigh-resolution videos of varyingdurations, aspect ratios, and resolutions, up to 1 min in length (Qin\net al.,2025) .W h i l eS o r ad e m o n s t r a t e sc a p abilities in video generation from text and image prompts,\nvideo extension, and style transfer, it exhibits limitations in accurately simulating complex physical\ninteractions. Yang et al. (2024b) introduce Holodeck, a system that automatically generates 3D\nsimulation environments from user prompts, addressing the challenge of manual 3D environment\ncreation in Embodied AI. Holodeck uses GPT-4 to acquire commonsense knowledge, reconstruct\nscenes with 3D assets, and optimize layouts, demo nstrating superior performance compared to\nprocedural baselines and supporting zero-shot object navigation for trained agents.\nThis study investigates the effectiveness of generative AI’s environmental understanding when\nprovided with an overhead view of an office environment, including spatial continuous distributions of\nroom temperatures as heatmaps and occupant locations, as input to MFMs.\n2.5. Agentic AI for logic control\nGenerative AI is expanding its input and output modalities, leading to increased multimodal utilization,\nincluding the ability to output program code for controlling devices. Recent research has demonstrated\nsuccess in using Agentic AI for the automatic generation of control code and utilizes the code for\nProgrammable Logic Controllers (PLCs), commonly used in industry, holding promise for accelerating\nindustrial automation. In the case of building HV AC systems, particularly large-scale HVAC systems in\nbuildings, centralized control systems are commonly used. This allows for the direct integration of control\ncode generated by generative AI, enabling dynamic adjustments to the control system. Yang et al. (2024a)\npropose AutoPLC, an LLM-based approach for automatically generating vendor-specific Structured Text\n(ST) code for PLCs. AutoPLC utilizes a knowledge base, a retrieval module, and a flexible code checker\nwith self-correction capabilities, outperforming baseline models on several ST code generation bench-\nmarks. Koziolek et al. (2023) investigate the potential of LLMs to generate PLC and Distributed Control\nSystem (DCS) control logic from natural language prompts. Using ChatGPT and a set of 100 prompts,\nthey demonstrate the generation of syntactically correct IEC 61131-3 Structured Text code, highlighting\nthe potential for LLMs to enhance control engineer productivity. Hu et al. (2025) introduce Automated\nDesign of Agentic Systems (ADAS) as a new research domain and propose Meta Agent Search, an\nalgorithm where a meta-agent programs and evaluates new agents iteratively. Agents discovered by this\nmethod significantly outperform manually designed agents on various benchmarks, demonstrating strong\ncross-domain transferability. Dou et al. (2024) present StepCoder, a code generation framework with\nCurriculum of Code Completion Subtasks (CCCS) and Fine-Grained Optimization (FGO), along with a\nnew dataset, APPS+. StepCoder demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models on\nmultiple code generation benchmarks, emphasizing improvements in exploration for reinforcement\nlearning. Xue et al. (2024) introduce ComfyBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based agents’\nability to design Collaborative AI Systems using the ComfyUI platform and propose ComfyAgent, a\nframework for autonomous design. While ComfyAgent outperforms baseline agents, the results highlight\nthe ongoing challenges in achieving fully autonomous design of complex AI systems. Si et al. (2024)\npresent Design2Code, a real-world benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) on code generation from visual designs. Experiments using this benchmark demonstrate that\nGPT-4V outperforms other baselines and can even generate web designs considered superior to the\noriginals, highlighting the model’s understanding of modern web design principles.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-7\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n2.6. HVAC control with generative AI\nStudies by Song et al. (2023b) and Ahn et al. (2023) have explored the use of LLMs for HVAC control on\nsimulation. Song et al. (2023b) employed a virtual building simulation model (BEAR) to evaluate the\nperformance of GPT-4 by OpenAI (2023) in controlling HV AC. Their research provided inputs like\nindoor/outdoor temperature, solar irradiance, setpoint temperature, and power status to GPT-4, and it\noutputted a value between/C0 1 and 1, indicating how much warmer/cooler the virtual environment should\nbe. The study found that GPT-4’s zero-shot inference achieved performance comparable to reinforcement\nlearning methods, although it lagged behind Model Predictive Control (MPC). Ahn et al. (2023) applied\nChatGPT to autonomous building system operation, validating its effectiveness on a virtual office\nbuilding simulation model. Their research demonstrated success in minimizing energy consumption\nacross various building systems, including HVAC, chillers, cooling towers, and pumps. Compared to\ndeep reinforcement learning, ChatGPT achieved a 16.8% reduction in energy consumption, while deep\nreinforcement learning resulted in a 24.1% reduction. The study highlighted the promise of ChatGPT-\nbased control due to its lower learning cost compared to reinforcement learning, making it potentially\nviable for real-world deployment.\nWhile these studies demonstrate the potential of using GPT-like general-purpose LLMs for zero-shot\nHVAC control with minimal training costs, they were all based on simulations. This research takes a step\nforward by conducting a real-world case study in an actual office environment. We aim to leverage\nmultimodal generative AI to control HVAC and minimize energy consumption while considering office\nworkers’ comfort. Our approach integrates real-time data from various IoT sensors and occupants’\nfeedback, providing a novel framework for exploring the practical application of generative AI in building\nsystem control.\n3. Methodology\n3.1. Case study modeling\nA 322 m2 office space in the Yokohama Dia Building in Yokohama, Japan, was rented for a field\nexperiment. The office layout is shown inFigures 1and 2. An average of 18.6 people worked in the office\nduring the experimental period. The room was equipped with seven HVAC units, each with a thermometer\nto measure the spatial temperature within the office. The objective of this experiment was to minimize\nenergy consumption while considering the comfort of occupants.\nSong et al. (2023b) conducted research utilizing generative AI for HVAC control. They provided the\nfollowing reward function as a prompt to the AI:\n1:0 /C0\nP\n0 ≤ i < n∣ai∣\nn\n/C18/C19\n+ α /C1 1 /C0\nP\n0 ≤ i < n ti /C0 TðÞ 2\nT /C1 n\n !\n(1)\nwhere ai represents the action value (/C0 100 to 0) for how much to open the air conditioner valve in theith\nroom in the simulation,n represents the number of rooms,T represents the target room temperature\nsetting, andti represents the indoor temperature of a specific room. This equation aims to minimize the\ndifference between the target temperature and the current temperature while minimizing valve operation\nto ensure energy efficiency.\nAs a preliminary experiment, we used this reward function as a prompt and provided hypothetical\nroom temperatures to GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) to evaluate its feasibility as a simulator for HV AC\ntemperature setting. Specifically, we assumed one HVAC unit per room and set the target room\ntemperature to 22°C for cooling. We then instructed GPT-4 to calculate the action values for hypothetical\ncurrent room temperatures of [19°C, 23°C, 25°C, 20°C]. The output results were [/C0 30, /C0 20, /C0 60, /C0 20].\nThis indicated significant fluctuations in the action values, with only about 30% of the trials in the\npreliminary experiment producing outputs with consistent magnitude relationships.\ne31-8 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n3.2. Human feedback\nWe hypothesized that increasing the constraints within the reward function might stabilize GPT-4’s\noutput. Therefore, in addition to the objective of“controlling air conditioners to create an optimally\ntempered environment,” we explicitly added“providing instructions to office workers based on their\nfeedback to enhance their comfort” to the prompt as a role for the LLMs. Specifically, we provided\nfeedback information such as“Currently, I am in Room 1, and my comfort level is 5 on a scale of 1 to 10,”\nalong with the aforementioned office environment simulation information. The output resulted in action\nvalues of [/C0 10, /C0 30, /C0 50, /C0 15] and a human-directed instruction stating,“Since you are currently in\nRoom 1 with a comfort level of 5, we recommend moving to a room closer to the target temperature. Since\nRoom 3 is warmer than the target temperature and you currently feel cold in Room 1, we recommend\nmoving to Room 3.” This result demonstrates that while generative AI may produce fluctuating results\nwhen seeking precise solutions, adding linguistic explanations alongside action values enables logical and\nconcrete explanations. Furthermore, incorporating human feedback into the generative AI model\nincreases the simulation’s specificity and leads to more relevant responses. Based on this preliminary\nFigure 1.CG rendering of the office used in this experiment, and the opposing view.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-9\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nexperiment, we decided to incorporate office worker feedback into the prompts for our main study,\nenabling the generative AI to perform simulations that consider subjective sensory information.\n3.3. Energy consumption estimation\nThe reward function used in Song et al. (2023b)’s input to the generative AI was an equation related to\nvalve control for air conditioners installed individually in each room. However, since the target office for\nthis field experiment has seven HVAC units in one room, it became necessary to modify the reward\nfunction equation. Therefore, based on the research by Semitsu et al. (2023), we decided to use the\nfollowing equation as the reward function, representing the estimated energy consumptionPE of each\nHVAC unit:\nΔTtðÞ = Tset tðÞ /C0 Tcurrent tðÞ (2a)\nDtðÞ = 1, if ΔTtðÞ ≥ 1:5\n0, otherwise\n/C26\n(2b)\nPE = 3kW /C1 1\nH\nXH/C0 1\nt = 0 DtðÞ (2c)\nFigure 2.The overhead map that shows the location of office workers and the spatial distribution of office\ntemperature via MELRemo-IPS IoT sensor device. Triangles (Δ) indicate the installation locations of the\nMELRemo-IPS sensors inFigure 3a, while inverted triangles (∇) represent the positions of the Soracom\nIoT sensors inFigure 3b. Human figures represent the location of office workers. The color distribution\nvisualizes the estimated temperature in degrees Celsius.\ne31-10 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nThe variablet represents time (in hours),Tset tðÞ represents the set temperature at timet (°C), andTcurrent tðÞ\nrepresents the current temperature at time t (°C). ΔTtðÞ represents the difference between the set\ntemperature and the current temperature at timet (°C). Additionally, DtðÞ is a variable that indicates\nwhether the difference between the set temperature and the current temperature at timet is greater than or\nequal to 1.5°C (1: greater than or equal to 1.5°C, 0: less than 1.5°C), andH represents the measurement\nduration in hours. In this experiment,H is set to 2. Semitsu et al. (2023) developed a machine learning\nmodel to predict air conditioning energy consumption in an office, utilizing the difference between set\ntemperature and current room temperature as an explanatory variable and finding that a difference\nexceeding 1.5°C resulted in an approximate +3 kW impact on power consumption. In this experiment,\nwe predicted the hourly power consumption for each HVAC unit and included it in the prompt.\n3.4. Office overhead map analysis\nTo enhance the specificity of generative AI simulations, overhead imagery incorporating room layout,\ntemperature distribution, and occupant locations were introduced (Figure 2). This leveraged [MELRemo-\nIPS], a commercial system that maps office worker locations and indoor temperature onto floor plans.\nWorker locations are determined via Bluetooth signal strength between registered devices and central\nunits (seeFigure 3a). Spatial temperature prediction utilizes data from HVAC-integrated thermal sensors.\nFurthermore, a separate commercial product from [SORACOM] provides localized illuminance and\ntemperature measurements.\nLeveraging GPT-4V’s image-to-text capabilities and employing the prompt engineering technique of\nYang et al. (2023b), we provided the model with overhead imagery and prompted it to describe occupant\npositions, room temperature, and spatial information (seeFigure 6). While minor inaccuracies in localized\ntemperature and precise positioning were observed, the model effectively identified general“hot” and\n“cold” zones. Consequently, these descriptions were integrated, anticipating a positive impact on HVAC\ncontrol strategy. This dynamic approach incorporates real-time office information into the prompt,\nenabling the multimodal foundation model to reflect the dynamically changing office environment.\n3.5. Proposed system concept and framework\nThis article proposes a system that utilizes generative AI to optimize the environment within an office. As\nillustrated inFigure 4, the system operates as follows: environmental data from the office, including IoT\nsensor information and feedback from office workers, are sensed in the physical domain and transmitted\nto the cloud. In the cyber domain, within the cloud, prompts are generated based on the acquired office\nenvironment data, and these prompts are used as input to a generative AI model. The generative AI model\nFigure 3.In this experiment, (a) was used to track occupant locations and estimate spatial temperature\ndistribution, while (b) was employed for measuring illuminance and obtaining pinpoint temperature.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-11\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nis tasked with predicting optimal HVAC setpoint temperatures for different zones or units within the\noffice. These predicted setpoints are then communicated to office occupants, who can implement the\nchanges using thermostats to control the HVAC system. The resulting changes in the HVAC system, in\nturn, affect the office environment. This iterative cycle allows the system to adapt to the dynamically\nchanging office environment. The optimization of temperature setpoints using generative AI in the cloud\nrepresents the cyber-domain component of the system, while the HVAC control and data acquisition from\nthe office constitute the physical-domain component. Therefore, this loop exemplifies a Cyber-Physical\nSystem (CPS).\nTo realize AI systems driven by machine learning and deep learning, incorporating human intervention\nin specific decision-making and control processes is referred to as“Human-in-the-Loop” (HITL).\nHowever, this study proposes an“Office-in-the-Loop” system that goes beyond relying solely on human\nfeedback. Instead, it integrates a comprehensive range of office information, including IoTsensor data and\nreal-time power consumption predictions, as constraints and inputs for the generative AI model. This\napproach utilizes diverse data sources to guide the generative AI’s decision-making and control processes,\ngoing beyond human feedback alone.\nWe hypothesized that generative AI could be used as a simulator for real-world optimization and\nimplemented the following flow (seeFigure 5): (1) We deployed IoT sensors in a real-world office to\nacquire environmental data and obtained subjective feedback on comfort from office workers, which were\nsent to a Prompt Generator. (2) The IoT sensor data was analyzed to create a map of the office layout\ndrawing, showing the estimated spatial distribution of office worker locations and indoor temperatures.\n(3) This map was input to a multimodal generative AI to generate a textual description, which was also\nsent to the Prompt Generator. (4) The Prompt Generator automatically summarized the received\ninformation and created tasks with clearly stated Objectives and Specific Instructions, allowing LLMs\nto reason in a more realistic scenario. Every 2 h, the IoT sensor data was input to LLMs as Few-shot\nExamples via Demonstrations as Historical Data. (5) The text automatically generated by the Prompt\nGenerator was input to LLMs to predict HV AC temperature settings that could achieve the objectives.\n(6) The actual HVAC temperature in the real-world office was changed. Since the office environment\nchanges dynamically, this was further sensed by IoT sensors, returning to the process in step 1).\nFigure 4.Conceptual diagram of the proposed system, illustrating the cyber-physical loop: real-world\noffice environment data is collected, used by generative AI in the cloud to predict optimal HVAC\ntemperatures, and then applied to control the physical HVAC system.\ne31-12 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n4. Implementation of our framework\n4.1. Prompt design\nPreliminary experiments (Section 3) demonstrated that integrating human feedback alongside energy\nefficiency and comfort constraints within a generative AI simulation framework yields more realistic and\npractical suggestions. This study explores effective prompting strategies for applying generative AI to a\npractical scenario. Beginning with a review of existing research (Section 3.1), we modify our approach to\nthe specific case study by incorporating feedback mechanisms (Section 3.2), estimated power consump-\ntion data (Section 3.3), and office map information (Section 3.4). The final prompt was validated in a\ndedicated preliminary experiment conducted in a real office environment to confirm the effectiveness.\nMoreover, incorporating office layout imagery enables the model to dynamically assess room state,\nincluding spatial temperature distribution and occupant locations. Based on these findings, we carefully\ndesigned our prompts.\nFirst, as illustrated inFigure 6, we provide the Objectives and Specific Instructions within the prompt.\nHere, we assign the role of an HV AC manager tasked with maintaining the room temperature at the target\nlevel while optimizing energy consumption. We sequentially feed external environmental information,\nsuch as outside temperature and sunlight intensity, along with details regarding HVAC placement and\ncontrol parameters within the room, prompting the model to predict the optimal set temperature for\neach unit.\nNext, we provide the following information to the prompt as the current situation: (1) room tempera-\nture of each area with an HVAC unit, (2) set temperature of each HV AC unit, (3) estimated power\nconsumption of each HVAC unit (calculated using Equation (2)), (4) feedback from office workers sent to\neach HVAC unit, and (5) external environmental information including outside temperature and sunlight\nintensity.\nFigure 5.Overview of our system for HVAC control using a multimodal foundation model. Leveraging\ngenerative AI as a simulator to achieve optimal HVAC forecasting that adapts to dynamically changing\nreal-world office environments.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-13\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nSubsequently, as depicted inFigure 2, we input the office layout image into the prompt and utilize a\nmultimodal foundation model to generate descriptions of the spatial temperature distribution and office\nworker locations within the office.\nFigure 6.Our prompt engineering for controlling HVAC.\ne31-14 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFinally, we provide Demonstrations containing Historical Data, including past LLM-generated set\ntemperatures, office environment information, and external environment information, to the prompt.\nTo ensure the LLM’s outputs are comprehensible and reliable, we have incorporated the concept of\nSelf-Consistency (Wang et al.,2023). Specifically, we provide a range for the control values (e.g., 18°C to\n26°C) within the prompts as a guardrail and perform multiple inferences to make a comprehensive\njudgment. The final HVAC setting value occurring most frequently over 10 trials was selected for\nrealizing a more stable prediction. During the experiment, human operators double-checked and ensured\nthe safety of the temperature settings. The experiment spans from 8 AM to 6 PM, with the generative AI\npredicting optimal set temperatures for each HVAC unit every 2 h. Therefore, the Demonstrations\naccumulate as examples every 2 h. Office workers provide subjective feedback on their thermal sensation\nto each HV AC unit using a seven-point scale ranging from/C0 3t o+ 3(/C0 3 being cold, 0 being comfortable,\nand + 3 being hot), similar to the PMV index. Notably, we pair the LLM-generated set temperatures for\neach HV AC unit with the actual room temperature of the corresponding area 2 h after setting, feedback\nfrom office workers, and the estimated power consumption of each HV AC unit. As the Demonstrations\nincrease, the LLM’s simulated estimates are updated with real-world data, promoting adaptation and more\naccurate predictions aligned with the real-world environment as the trials progress.\nIn this article, we extend the previously discussed prompt engineering by investigating the impact of\nallowing the generative AI to validate its own predictions using the acquired environmental data. This is\ncompared against the performance of Self-Consistency (Wang et al.,2023). We introduce Data-Driven\nReasoning, a technique that prompts the model to provide rational explanations for its predictions,\ngrounded in the environmental data. Our findings indicate that, combined with zero-shot CoT, Data-\nDriven Reasoning not only facilitates the generation of human-interpretable explanations based on the\ndata but also improves prediction accuracy, achieving effective results with a reduced number of trials. A\ndetailed analysis of this is presented in the Ablation Study,Section 6.\n4.2. Experimental design\nThis study was conducted as a real-world experiment in an actual office environment for a total of one and\na half months, divided into two separate experimental periods. The first period ran from 15 January to\n9 February, while the second period lasted from 26 February to 8 March. Three different approaches for\ncontrolling the HVAC system were compared:\n Baseline: The baseline HVAC system operated in its default automatic mode, maintaining a constant\nset temperature of 23°C, which is the standard winter setting for this particular office. While the\nbaseline system (e.g., [PEFY-P140M-E1]) lacks modern AI-powered features, its automatic mode\nheuristically adjusts heating/cooling based on temperature fluctuations. Specifically, if the tempera-\nture deviates from the setpoint by 1.5°C for 3 min, the system activates the appropriate mode. This\nrepresents a common, though simplistic, commercial HVAC setup.\n LLMs + MFMs: This approach integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multimodal\nFoundation Models (MFMs). The MFM analyzes overhead office imagery, extracting environmen-\ntal information such as occupant count and temperature distribution. This information, combined\nwith estimated energy consumption data and two-hourly occupant comfort feedback, is input to the\nLLMs, which subsequently generate optimal HVAC set temperatures.\n LLMs: This approach was similar to LLMs + MFMs, but without the use of the MFM to analyze\noverhead images.\nWhile the experiment plan was finalized 3 weeks prior to execution, the specific execution dates for the\nproposed method and baseline were not pre-determined with respect to weather conditions. To ensure the\nrobustness and reliability of the baseline measurements, we performed each step of the process twice over\nmultiple weeks. Due to the large room (322 m\n2), room temperature has not changed rapidly in response to\nHVAC setpoint adjustments, indicating a significant thermal inertia. This is due to the large heat capacity\nData-Centric Engineering e31-15\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nsuch as air, furniture, and walls. Short control intervals would be insufficient to induce a perceivable\ntemperature change for occupants. Therefore, to account for this thermal inertia and ensure a significant\nimpact on room temperature, a control frequency of 2 h was selected for this experiment.\n5. Experiments and results\nThe experiment was conducted over a period from 15 January to 8 March, during which the average\noutdoor temperature was a low 8.38°C and the average indoor temperature was maintained at 22.2°C. The\naverage daily energy consumption for the entire experimental period was 54.1 kWh. A total of 30 office\nworkers, men and women in their 20s to 50s, participated in the experiment, with an average daily\noccupancy of 18.6 people. The LLM used was GPT-4 (gpt-4-1106-preview, OpenAI,2023) and the MFM\nwas GPT-4V (gpt-4-1106-vision-preview, Yang et al.,2023b). The total cost of running the system, even\nwith the more expensive GPT-4V, was only $3.62 per day. Comfort feedback was aggregated using the\nroot mean square (RMS) to account for individual variations in thermal comfort perception:\nR\nij =\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\n1\nni\nXM\nj = 1x2\nij\nr\n(3a)\nCtotal = 1\nN\nXN\ni = 1Rij (3b)\nwhere xij corresponds to the comfort feedback received from areaj at turni. N is the number of total turn\nand M is the number of total area (we setN=5 andM=7, respectively).ni represents the number of areas\nproviding valid feedback at turni. Rij is the RMS comfort index for all areas at turni. Ctotal signifies the\naverage RMS comfort index for areaj.\nTable 1summarizes the average daily measured electricity consumption and the RMS of occupant\nfeedback for each experimental condition. The electricity consumption data (kWh) used in this study is\nderived from the actual monthly electricity bills provided by the building owner to the office tenants. A\nlower RMS value is desirable. It shows that both LLM-based approaches significantly improved energy\nefficiency and comfort compared to the baseline. LLMs alone achieved a higher energy efficiency\nimprovement (47.92%) than LLMs + MFMs (34.97%). Both approaches showed similar levels of comfort\nimprovement (26.36% and 25.93%). The results inTable 1suggest that the proposed method achieves\nmore stable comfort, as indicated by the smaller RMS value and lower variability in feedback, with\nresponses concentrated around 0, representing a comfortable state. On the other hand, the baseline\nexhibits a larger RMS value and greater variability in feedback, with responses deviating significantly\nfrom the mean, indicating a wider range of comfort perceptions among occupants.\nFigure 7shows box plots of electricity consumption and occupant feedback. LLMs alone demonstrated\na smaller variance in energy consumption compared to LLMs + MFMs, indicating more consistent energy\nsavings. However, both LLM-based approaches exhibited similar effectiveness in improving comfort\nlevels, although LLMs alone showed greater variability in feedback scores.\nTable 1. Comparison of energy efficiency and comfort\nMethod\nEnergy consumption Occupants’ feedback\nMeasured (kWh) Reduction (%) RMS Reduction (%)\nBaseline 82.40 – 1.180 –\nLLMs 42.92 47.92 0.869 26.36\nLLMs + MFMs 53.58 34.97 0.874 25.93\ne31-16 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFigure 8depicts indoor temperature fluctuations and corresponding HVAC set temperatures at 2-h\nintervals (10 AM–6 PM) for three experimental days. In the first column, this subplot represents a day of\n4 March with the baseline HVAC control. As the set temperature remained fixed at 23°C with auto-mode,\nthere was a significant difference between the lowest and highest recorded indoor temperatures, indicating\npotential discomfort due to temperature fluctuations. In the second column, this subplot demonstrates the\nresults from a day of 7 March when the HV AC system was controlled by the LLMs approach. It can be\nobserved that after the second time step, the indoor temperature exceeded the set temperature, prompting\nthe system to turn off the HV AC unit to prevent overheating. This suggests the LLM’s ability to\nproactively adjust to changing conditions. In the third column, this subplot showcases the performance\nof the combined LLMs and MFMs approach on 8 March. Notably, after initially raising the set\ntemperature in the second time step, the system subsequently lowered it in the third time step as the\nindoor temperature continued to rise. This adaptive behavior demonstrates the potential benefit of\nintegrating visual information through MFMs for finer control. Both the LLMs and LLMs + MFMs\napproaches exhibited a smoother and more gradual control strategy compared to the baseline. This\nresulted in smaller temperature fluctuations, which likely contributed to improved thermal comfort for the\noffice workers. Furthermore, the ability to turn off unnecessary HVAC units as deemed by the generative\nAI models likely contributed to significant energy savings.\nFurther details on the behavior of the generative AI were analyzed by visualizing the time series data of\nfeedback, indoor/outdoor temperatures, and the HV AC setpoint. The temperature predictions for HVAC\ncontrol (see Figures 9 and 10) are informed by all feedback received up to the time of prediction.\nTherefore, control actions reflected the system’s state at each prediction time.Figure 9shows the results\nfrom the experiment day where control was managed exclusively by LLMs. Initially, in response to\nfeedback indicating slight coldness (/C0 1), the LLM set the temperature to 20°C. Subsequent feedback of\n“comfortable” (0) led to the deactivation. This deactivation continued following further“comfortable\nrange” feedback (0.6). The LLM’s ability to maintain comfort while deactivating the system demonstrates\nits potential for energy savings.\nFigure 10 illustrates environmental variations in Area 6 and 7 during MFM deployment. In Area\n7 (10b), the system maintained a constant 20°C set temperature without feedback, likely to mitigate heat\nloss through windows, given the low external temperature (1°C). While occupant feedback was not\nconsistently available, office workers were confirmed via office map data, preventing deactivation.\nFigure 7.Box plots of electricity consumption and occupant feedback across experimental conditions.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-17\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nFigure 8.Office temperature and HVAC setpoint are shown for seven areas, comparing different\nexperimental methodologies (columns) and areas (rows). The x-axis represents time of day, and the y-axis\nrepresents temperature. Blue lines indicate room temperature, green lines HVAC setpoint, and red dots\nHVAC shutdowns, respectively.\ne31-18 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nConversely, in Area 6 (10c), the system initially remained off at 17°C. Negative comfort feedback (/C0 1)\nprompted a temperature increase to 19°C and system activation. Subsequent comfortable feedback (/C0 0.5,\n0) triggered deactivation. The absence of adjacent windows in Area 6 suggests minimal thermal\nconduction, potentially prioritizing continued operation in Area 7 due to thermal inertia. In contrast to\nFigure 10, relying solely on LLMs can lead to HVAC deactivation even with occupants present, as the\nabsence of feedback prevents the LLMs from considering occupancy in their predictions. Conversely,\nincorporating MFMs allows for the inclusion of office workers’ locations, ensuring that the presence of\npeople is considered even in the absence of explicit feedback.\nFigure 11a,b detailed breakdown of actual electricity consumption and user feedback.Figure 11a\nshows the hourly energy consumption for each approach, along with the average outdoor temperature.\nPrevious analyses have demonstrated an inverse correlation between outdoor temperature and power\nconsumption. It can be observed that the baseline approach maintained a relatively constant energy\nconsumption regardless of outdoor temperature fluctuations, except during periods of extremely low\ntemperatures. In contrast, LLMs alone demonstrated robust energy savings by dynamically adjusting\nenergy consumption in response to changes in outdoor temperature. LLMs + MFMs showed a similar\ntrend but exhibited higher energy consumption during periods of extremely low temperatures.Figure 11b\nillustrates the user feedback scores alongside the number of office workers present in the office. Notably,\nfeedback varied even with a similar number of occupants, indicating individual preferences and potential\nlimitations of the baseline system in adapting to feedback. Both LLM-based approaches, by leveraging\nfeedback to predict optimal set temperatures, exhibited a tendency toward lower feedback scores,\nsuggesting improved responsiveness to user comfort.\nTable 2presents the detailed correlations between outdoor temperature, measured energy consump-\ntion, and estimated energy consumption. The correlation map utilizes Spearman’s rank correlation\ncoefficient that indicates both positive and negative associations, with larger absolute values signifying\nstronger correlations. FromTable 2, it is evident that the predicted energy consumption has a negative\ncorrelation with outdoor temperature. Conversely, the predicted energy consumption shows a positive\ncorrelation with the actual measured energy consumption. This finding supports the validity of incorp-\norating predicted energy consumption as input to the generative AI model for controlling energy usage.\nInterestingly, the measured energy consumption exhibits a negative correlation with outdoor temperature.\nFigure 9.Experiments conducted on 29 February in area 5.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-19\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nThis suggests that the generative AI system may have significantly reduced electricity consumption,\nparticularly on hotter days (shown inFigure 11a).\nNext, a correlation analysis was conducted between the average feedback input to the generative AI\nand the average HV AC setpoint temperature output by the generative AI.Figure 12apresents the analysis\nresults from 15 January to 9 February, whileFigure 12bpresents the analysis results from 26 February to\n8 March. As feedback is received from occupants in each area where HVAC units are located, there are\nseven HVAC outputs corresponding to seven feedback inputs. The feedback was averaged daily for each\narea using the absolute value.Figure 12b, unlikeFigure 12a, shows a positive correlation between the\nfeedback input AI and the output temperature. Referring toFigure 11b, it can be observed that the period\nfrom 26 February to 8 March exhibited less variability in feedback and lacked extreme temperature\ndifferences across areas, which may explain the observed positive correlation.\nA correlation analysis using the least squares method was conducted to examine the relationship\nbetween the actual power consumption as the dependent variable and five independent variables: the three\nFigure 10.Experiments with LLMs and MFMs conducted on 5 February.\ne31-20 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nexperimental conditions, outside temperature, and the number of occupants. The results inTable 3,\nindicate a moderate positive correlation only for the baseline condition. In contrast, the use of LLMs alone\nshowed a moderate negative correlation, while combining LLMs and MFMs resulted in a weak negative\ncorrelation. Concerning external factors, outside air temperature exhibited a moderate negative correl-\nation, and the number of occupants showed a weak negative correlation. These findings suggest that\nenergy consumption tends to increase under the baseline condition and decrease when using LLMs alone.\nThe addition of MFMs, however, did not show a clear impact on energy consumption. Interestingly,\nhigher outside air temperatures were associated with a decrease in energy consumption. However, since\nFigure 11.Differences in (a) measured electricity consumption and (b) occupant feedback across\nexperimental conditions.\nTable 2.

To avoid multicollinearity, the\nbaseline condition was used as the reference level. The model demonstrated a high goodness-of-fit,\nachieving an R-squared value of 0.898, indicating that the model explains 89.8% of the variance observed\nin the data. The intercept represents the predicted power consumption when all other variables are held\nFigure 12.Correlation map between (a) occupant feedback (F) and (b) predicted optimal HVAC settings\n(P) for each office area (number).

Notably, utilizing LLMs alone resulted in an average reduction of 49.512 kWh in actual\npower consumption, while combining LLMs and MFMs led to an average decrease of 38.196 kWh.\nFurthermore, a 1°C rise in outside temperature was associated with an average reduction of 6.351 kWh in\npower consumption. These variables exhibitedp-values less than 0.05, indicating their statistically\nsignificant impact on reducing power consumption. Conversely, while an increase of one occupant\nwas associated with a 0.72 kWh increase in power consumption, this effect was not statistically\nsignificant. These results confirm that both LLM-based approaches, whether used individually or in\ncombination with MFMs, significantly reduced energy consumption compared to the baseline. Further-\nmore, the analysis revealed that higher outside air temperatures were linked to lower energy consumption,\nlikely attributable to reduced cooling demands. However, the number of occupants did not significantly\nimpact energy consumption in this experimental setting.\n6. Ablation study\n6.1. Rational explanation in data-driven reasoning\nAs an ablation study, the same prompts used in the 7 March experiment were input to modern MFMs\n(Gemini-1.5-pro-exp-0827, GeminiTeam, 2024a) and GPT-4o-20240513 (OpenAI, 2024). Optimal\nsettings for the seven HV AC units were predicted based on the mode of 10 trials. The modern MFMs\ntended to produce a more stable setpoint prediction when the mode of 10 trials was taken same as Self-\nConsistency (Wang et al.,2023). Table 5indicates a tendency toward convergence to similar results. The\nTurn number represents the prediction results at 2-h intervals, starting at 10:00 AM. Although the\ngenerative AI models produce similar predictions for the afternoon, their predictions diverge in the\nmorning. This divergence can likely be attributed to the more substantial fluctuations in both outdoor and\nindoor temperatures during the morning hours, coupled with the area-specific variations in feedback.\nConsequently, the models may infer multiple plausible optimal temperatures from similar input infor-\nmation.\nTable 6presents the output and reasoning generated by Gemini1.5 (GeminiTeam,2024a), a multi-\nmodal generative AI, when tasked with predicting HV AC settings. It seems that target temperatures for\neach area are determined based on the current room temperature and feedback. Furthermore, the HVAC\nTable 5.

Given the improved reasoning capabilities of these state-of-the-art\nmodels, it is reasonable to expect that incorporating human-understandable explanations into their outputs\nwill enhance the acceptability and adoption of generative AI for industrial equipment control in industrial\npractical scenarios.\nFurthermore, acknowledging the remarkable recent advancements in Agentic AI, we investigated\nwhether the simulation capabilities of these models, particularly large-scale generative AI models\ndesigned for multi-stage deep reasoning, could yield more rational and mathematically sound explan-\nations. This investigation is based on the hypothesis that the internal representations of these modern\ngenerative AI models, trained with vast numbers of parameters, sufficiently learn real-world phenomena\nand can therefore function as world models.\nFor example, OpenAI’s o1 (OpenAI,2025) is trained with large-scale reinforcement learning to reason\nusing CoT prompting, enabling it to respond with deliberate contextual consistency. Similarly, Google’s\nGemini 2.0 (Pichai et al.,2024) is reportedly developed for Agentic AI, capable of understanding the\nworld more deeply and reasoning autonomously over multiple steps.\nInitially, we examined how predictions varied when Agentic AI models were provided with prompts\nsummarizing historical information obtained from our experiments, including past IoT sensor data, office\nworker feedback, and HVAC settings. Previous experiments revealed that predicting precise optimal\ntemperatures with generative AI models was challenging, with variations of around 2°C observed across\ntrials. Therefore, we employed Self-Consistency, a prompt engineering technique that involves multiple\ninference runs and selecting the mode of the outputs, to stabilize predictions. However, Self-Consistency\nincurs a cost proportional to the number of inference runs required to determine the mode.\nIn this study, we discovered that incorporating Data-Driven Reasoning, where the generative AI\nexplains its rationale based on provided data, had the effect of stabilizing the predicted optimal HV AC\ntemperatures, causing them to converge to a consistent value. The following prompt, adapted from the\nmain experiment, was used for the Data-Driven Reasoning runs:\n[Provide a rationale for each of your predicted optimal temperatures, based on observed sensor data\nand feedback.]\nTable 6. Results of querying Gemini1.5 (GeminiTeam,2024a) on March 7 (Turn 4 prompt) for the\nrationale behind HVAC settings\nRoom temperatures are currently between 23°C and 26°C, with feedback indicating a comfortable\nenvironment.\nTo prioritize energy conservation, the following AC settings are maintained:\n ACs 1, 2, and 7 (near windows, medium-high sunlight): Deactivated with resulting temperatures\nof 23–24°C and“comfortable” feedback. Despite a 1°C rise in external temperature, these units\nremain off due to sunlight’s influence and will be monitored.\n ACs 3 and 5 (near windows, high sunlight): Set at 20°C, maintaining room temperatures at 23–24°C\nwith “comfortable” feedback. This setting is optimal given the strong sunlight, which is expected to\nkeep temperatures comfortable even at a lower set point.\n ACs 4 and 6 (interior, influenced by ACs 3 and 5): Set at 20°C, maintaining room temperatures at\n24–26°C with“comfortable” feedback. The settings for ACs 3 and 5 should sufficiently regulate\ntemperatures in these areas.\nOverall, the current configuration prioritizes energy conservation by minimizing changes and keeping\nunnecessary units off. Ongoing temperature and comfort feedback will be monitored, and adjustments\nmade as needed. Specifically, window-side AC settings will be reevaluated if sunlight intensity\nchanges.\ne31-24 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTherefore, for the days during the experimental period where only LLMs were used, we conducted\n10 inference runs using Self-Consistency with modern models such as o1 and Gemini 2.0 to determine the\nmode. We then evaluated how closely a single inference run using Data-Driven Reasoning with the same\nmodel matched the Self-Consistency result, using the following methods:\n HVAC ON/OFF prediction:The HVAC ON/OFF predictions in our experiments were treated as a\nbinary classification task. We assessed whether the Data-Driven Reasoning prediction matched the\nmode of the 10 Self-Consistency trials, calculating Precision and Recall.\n HVAC temperature prediction:For HVAC temperature predictions, we calculated the success rate\nof the single Data-Driven Reasoning prediction falling within ± 1°C and ± 0.5°C of the mean of the\n10 Self-Consistency trials. We also calculated the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between the Data-\nDriven Reasoning prediction and the mean of the Self-Consistency trials.\n Temperature parameter:The temperature parameter for the generative AI models was set to 0, as\nused in the main experiments. However, for o1, the default value was used, as this model does not\nsupport temperature modification.\nFor the experiments, we utilized the following Generative AI models: GPT-4 (gpt-4-1106-preview,\nOpenAI, 2023), GPT-4o (2024-05-01-preview, OpenAI, 2024), OpenAI o1 (2024-12-01-preview,\nOpenAI, 2025), Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2 (claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022, Anthropic,2024), Gemini\n1.5 Pro (gemini-1.5-pro-002, GeminiTeam,2024a), and Gemini 2.0 Flash (gemini-2.0-flash-exp, Pichai\net al.,2024).\nFigure 13illustrates the prediction spread for the optimal HV AC temperature when historical data from\nthe experimental period was provided as input to each generative AI model without employing Data-\nDriven Reasoning, instead using Self-Consistency with 10 inference trials to determine the mode.\nUtilizing the prompt structure shown inFigure 6 without Data-Driven Reasoning and performing\n10 inferences via Self-Consistency tends to narrow the prediction spread of the optimal temperature.\nHowever, the results indicate that, depending on the model, the distribution containing 50% of the data\n(i.e., interquartile range) still varies by approximately 2 °C across the dataset.\nFigure 13.Box plot of HVAC temperature predictions from 10 inferences using Self-Consistency without\nData-Driven Reasoning.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-25\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 7presents the results comparing Data-Driven Reasoning against Self-Consistency for two tasks:\nbinary classification (i.e., predicting HV AC ON/OFF state) and temperature prediction (i.e., predicting the\noptimal setpoint). Each numerical value in the table represents the average performance over the 13-day\nexperimental period, where the historical information was fed into each generative AI model to predict the\nHVAC operational strategy.\nFirst, regarding the Binary Classification task (seeTable 7), the accuracy exhibited significant\nvariation depending on the generative AI model used. NotablyMFMs such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5\nPro, as well as the agentic AI model Gemini 2.0, consistently predicted the HV AC ON/OFF state with\nstability. For these models, the accuracy achieved with a single prediction using Data-Driven Reasoning\nwas remarkably close to the accuracy obtained using the mode of 10 trials with Self-Consistency alone,\ndemonstrating high performance. Conversely, models like OpenAI o1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed a\ntendency for their ON/OFF instructions to fluctuate across trials, resulting in somewhat lower accuracy.\nThese findings suggest that while model-specific accuracy differences exist, employing Data-Driven\nReasoning enables high-accuracy prediction of HVAC operational states for the binary classification task.\nNext, focusing on the Temperature Prediction task (seeTable 7), we examined the accuracy of\npredictions falling within ± 1°C of the mean temperature predicted by Self-Consistency. In this task\ntoo, multimodal foundation models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and the agentic AI Gemini 2.0 demonstrated\nstable performance, predicting the optimal HV AC setpoint temperature with high accuracy, exceeding\n90%. Furthermore, Gemini 2.0 achieved an accuracy of over 90% even within the stricter range of ± 0.5°C\nfrom the Self-Consistency mean prediction. Multimodal models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 also\nachieved accuracies exceeding 80% within the ± 1°C range. Referring back to the distribution of\npredicted temperatures using Self-Consistency shown inFigure 13, it is evident that while the prompt\nengineering strategy from the proposed method (seeFigure 6) helps reduce prediction variance, consist-\nently achieving temperature predictions with over 90% accuracy within a ± 0.5°C range remains a\nchallenging task. However, the effectiveness of our proposed approach, particularly the Data-Driven\nReasoning component, becomes evident when considering the initial prediction spread. As shown by the\nbox plot inFigure 13, the interquartile range (IQR) of the Self-Consistency predictions spans approxi-\nmately 2°C, representing the central 50% of the data and indicating significant initial variability. Despite\nthis wide initial distribution, our method enables all tested generative AI models to achieve over 50%\naccuracy within the narrow ± 0.5°C range, with Gemini 2.0 remarkably surpassing 90%. This demon-\nstrates that Data-Driven Reasoning effectively mitigates the inherent prediction variance, yielding highly\nprecise and reliable temperature setpoints. Furthermore, examining the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in\nTable 7, the average prediction errors for Gemini 2.0, Gemini 1.5, and GPT-4 were below 0.5°C,\nindicating that their responses were stable relative to the given information. In contrast, OpenAI o1 sets\na fixed default temperature parameter, causing its predictions to deviate significantly depending on the\ntarget, thus resulting in the lowest accuracy for this task in our experiments. These results collectively\nindicate that although performance fluctuations exist depending on the specific generative AI model used,\nTable 7.

This reduction in overhead is a significant consideration for\npractical deployment in industrial scenarios.\n6.2. Impact of advanced agentic AI on energy consumption\nWe simulated the potential energy savings achievable by operating the HVAC system with optimal\ntemperature settings predicted by state-of-the-art Agentic AI, using the experimental history data as input.\nThe regression coefficientbLLMs = /C0 49:512 obtained from the regression analysis (seeTable 4) repre-\nsents the change in total daily energy consumption when switching from the baseline control strategy\nwithout LLM to the LLM-based control strategy. This coefficient cannot be directly applied to tempera-\nture differences. Therefore, we used the regression coefficientb\nLLMs to estimate the impact on the energy\nby the change in the HV AC ON/OFF by comparing control strategies, between the one based on GPT-4\nused in the original experiment and that of the new Agentic AI models.\nFirst, using the 13-day experimental history data employing only the LLM, we prepared prompts\ncontaining one day’s worth of demonstration information. These prompts were used as input for each\nAgentic AI. We employed the Self-Consistency method, performing 10 trials and selecting the mode as\nthe predicted optimal HVAC settings (temperature and ON/OFF state) for each Agentic AI. For each\nHVAC unit, the estimated energy change was calculated based on the agreement between the Agentic AI’s\nprediction and the GPT-4 prediction used in the experiment. If the predictions matched, the estimated\nenergy change was set to 0. If the Agentic AI predicted OFF while GPT-4 predicted ON, the estimated\nenergy change was the negative of the average energy impact per HVAC unit. Conversely, if the Agentic\nAI predicted ON while GPT-4 predicted OFF, the estimated energy change was the positive of the average\nenergy impact per HVAC unit.\nThe average energy impact per unit is calculated by dividing the regression coefficientb\ni by the number\nof HV AC units (N), assuming equal contribution from each unit. The total estimated daily energy change\nwas calculated by summing theΔEi values for all seven HV AC units. This change was then added to the\naverage daily energy consumption of GPT-4 during the experiment (42.92 kWh) to obtain the estimated\ntotal daily consumption of the new model. Furthermore, we calculated the percentage change in energy\nconsumption of each Agentic AI relative to the GPT-4-based operation and baseline. The results are\nshown inTable 8.\nBased on the results inTable 8, projections suggest a high likelihood that utilizing newer generative AI\nmodels— specifically GPT-4o, OpenAI o1, and Gemini 1.5— for HV AC operation could achieve further\nreductions in energy consumption compared to the GPT-4 model used in the actual experiments. For\nGemini 2.0, the projected energy consumption was equivalent to that of the actual GPT-4 operation,\nTable 8.

Conversely,\npredictions from Claude 3.5 frequently indicated activating the HVAC (i.e., ON state) during periods\nwhen the actual control (i.e., implemented by GPT-4) maintained an OFF state; consequently, its use is\nprojected to increase energy consumption relative to GPT-4. However, it is anticipated that all evaluated\ngenerative AI models can deliver substantial energy savings compared to the baseline HV AC automatic\noperation mode (i.e., operation without generative AI).\n6.3. Mathematical modeling of office environments using agentic AI\nAs an additional experiment, we investigated whether the detailed historical information obtained in\nour experiments, including IoT sensor data and worker feedback, could be leveraged by a state-of-the-\nart Agentic AI to generate a mathematical formulation for optimizing the trade-off between office\nenvironment comfort and cost reduction on a daily basis. Typically, optimizing the control of office\nequipment involves accumulating a large amount of data and then using reinforcement learning to train\nthe weights of a human-defined model. In this experiment, we provided the following additional\nprompt to the Agentic AI, instructingi tt op e r f o r mt h eo f f i c ee n v i r o nment modeling itself and to derive\noptimal coefficients and weights using the historical information, and examined whether the AI could\nexplain it.\n[In the previous task, you predicted the optimal temperature for each HVAC unit based on the\nprovided IoT sensor information and worker feedback. This task involves addressing the inherent\ntrade-off between: (1) the increased cost of operating HV AC units continuously or with large\ndeviations from the current set temperature, and (2) the decreased worker comfort if the environ-\nment is not maintained at a comfortable level, even at a higher cost. Based on the information\ncurrently available, please formulate a mathematical expression to represent this trade-off and\nprovide a detailed explanation.\nIn formulating the equation, please be sure to consider all available sensor data and worker feedback\nfrom today, and to incorporate coefficients (weights) that optimize for both comfort and power\nconsumption. Explain the specific values assigned to these weights and provide a justification for\nyour choices. Specifically, the weights and coefficients must demonstrably achieve the optimal\nbalance based on today’s data, and your reasoning needs to be clearly attributable to the provided\ninformation.]\nTables 9–11 show the predicted optimal HVAC temperatures when all prompts up to Turn 5 on 7 March\nare given, along with the explanations of the office environment modeled from the daily office\nenvironment data described by each Agentic AI. While all methods yielded the same optimal HVAC\ntemperature setting prediction, the resulting mathematical formulations of the office environment differed\nacross the models.\nLooking at the results of GPT-4o inTable 9, the model calculated weights that prioritize reducing\npower consumption over improving comfort, and provided a justification for this. However, it failed to\nadequately explain the equations for energy consumption and comfort.\nThe results of OpanAI o1 inTable 10show that the model consists of three component equations: one\nrelating to the temperature perceived as comfortable by office workers and the current room temperature,\nanother relating to the outside temperature and the current set temperature, and a third relating to sudden\nchanges in the set temperature. This model emphasizes comfort in its equation explanation. Notably, it\nprovides a comprehensive explanation of the phenomena, including how a large difference between the\noutside temperature and the set temperature leads to significant power consumption, and how abruptly\nchanging the set temperature oneself places a large load on the HV AC system, increasing power\nconsumption. All of these equations are constructed based on the acquired data, resulting in higher\nexplanatory power compared to the results of GPT-4o.\ne31-28 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 9.

Leti be\nthe index of the air conditioner (and its corresponding area),Ti be the actual room temperature\nmaintained by air conditioneri, Tset,i be the set temperature of air conditioneri, Tpref ,i be the preferred\ntemperature of the occupant (estimated from actual feedback),Tout be the outdoor temperature, and\nΔTprev,i be the change in set temperature from the previous time step.

The second term indicates that the energy consumption\nincreases as the difference between the set temperature of the air conditioner and the outdoor\ntemperature increases. The third term represents the fact that a larger change in the set temperature\nrequires a more rapid change in operation, resulting in extra energy costs. The weightsw\n1, w2, andw3\nare determined based on the operational policy, such as prioritizing comfort or energy saving. As an\nexample, consider the settingsw1 =1 :0, w2 =0 :6, andw3 =0 :3. w1 is set to the largest value to prioritize\nthe comfort of the occupants.w2 is given a moderate value to consider energy saving in parallel.w3 is\nincluded to suppress the load caused by abrupt operations; it is set to a smaller, but non-negligible value\nfor control purposes. This configuration aims to satisfy comfort levels while avoiding excessive setting\nchanges and limiting increases in power consumption.\nNote: The results of the optimal temperature prediction for HV ACs 1 through 7 in the“Optimal settings” are shown in order from the beginning of the\narray. 0 indicates shutdown, and each numerical value represents the temperature in degrees Celsius.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-29\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nThe results of Gemini 2.0 inTable 11show that the weight settings prioritize the comfort of office\nworkers. Regarding the comfort equation, the sum of the difference between the ideal room temperature\nand the current room temperature, plus the feedback on the current room temperature, is inverted. This\nindicates that a smaller difference between the ideal temperature and the current temperature, and\nfeedback closer to 0 (indicating comfort), is better. On the other hand, the equation for energy consump-\ntion is designed such that the smaller the discrepancy between the set temperature and the room\ntemperature, the higher the overall evaluation.\nAs shown inTables 9–11, the variations in the explanations provided by each Agentic AI demonstrate\nthat even when using the same prompts, including sensing data of the office environment and worker\nfeedback information, to predict the same optimal temperature setting, the mathematical explanations of\nhow the office environment was modeled and how the optimal setting temperature was derived differ.\nAn interesting point of this experiment is that when Agentic AI is used to provide mathematical\nexplanations for complex real-world events, it can provide rational explanations based on various\nexplanatory variables of the office environment obtained on that day. Specifically, the problem of\ndesigning the weights of the cost function included in the equation typically requires collecting a large\namount of data and performing reinforcement learning or physical modeling to construct a highly accurate\nsimulator. However, the results of this experiment suggest that Agentic AI has the potential to be used as a\nsimplified simulation even though in real-world complex scenarios.\n7. Discussion\nIn Section 5, we demonstrated that by using generative AI to predict the optimal temperature for HV AC in\nan actual office, over approximately one and a half months of empirical experiments, energy efficiency\nimproved by 47.92% and office worker comfort increased by 26.36% compared to HV AC’s automatic\noperation mode without generative AI. InSection 6, under the hypothesis that the simulation capability of\nAgentic AI (i.e., its internal representation of the environment) is learned to approximate the world like a\nWorld-model through vast amounts of training data, enabling it to infer causes from observational\ninformation such as IoT sensors and predict future or unknown events from these inferred causes, we\nproposed Data-Driven Reasoning. We showed that this can stabilize the inference accuracy of Agentic AI\nand validated the explainability of Agentic AI through rational textual explanations and mathematical\nformulas.\nRegarding the implementation of the proposed approach in existing real-world buildings, as described\nin this study, the optimal temperature settings for office building HVAC can be readily determined by\ndeploying IoTsensors in existing buildings and leveraging cloud services. In this experiment, since only a\npart of the office building was targeted, the HVACtemperature settings were performed manually;\nhowever, for an entire building, automation is desirable. In such cases, automatic control is considered\nfeasible by formatting the generative AI’s output into a format such as JavaScript Object Notation\n( J S O N )t h a tc a nb er e a db yat y p i c a le x i s t i n gb u i l d i n g’s central control system. The focal point of this\nsolution is how to connect the cloud and the building system. For example, implementation is easier\nwith newer systems that can be operated via APIs. However, for on-premise systems, manual operation,\nas in this experiment, or the use of IoT devices that physically operate switches directly, is more\nrealistic. Furthermore, when considering operating generative AI itself within an on-premise system,\nthe trade-off between the number of parameters inLLM or VLM models and their inference capabilities\nbecomes crucial for feasibility. Recently, models have been developed that are lightweight enough to\nrun on smartphones while possessing the versatility to solve general problems. In the future, whether\nlightweight models can maintain performance during inference and whether they can operate on GPUs\nthat do not require electrical work will also be important for widespread adoption.\nMoreover, in implementing the Data-Driven Reasoning using Agentic AI as proposed inSection 6,\nreal-world observation data from IoT sensors are crucial for rational explanations and reasoning. Regarding\nIoT devices deployment, we propose the following recommendations:\ne31-30 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 11. Results of querying Gemini2.0 (Pichai et al.,2024) on 7 March (Turn 5 prompt) for the\nrationale behind HVAC settings with mathematical reasoning\nOptimal settings: [0, 0, 20, 20, 20, 0, 0]\nTo formulate the trade-off problem, we define the following elements:\n C: Comfort\n E: Energy Consumption\n wc: Weighting factor for comfort\n we: Weighting factor for energy consumption\n Ti: Set temperature of air conditioneri\n Ri: Room temperature in the area of air conditioneri\n Fi: Feedback for air conditioneri (quantified)\n Pi: Power consumption of air conditioneri\nComfort is evaluated based on the room temperature and feedback in each area. To quantify the feedback,\nwe use the following mapping: Very Cold:/C0 3, Cold:/C0 2, Slightly Cold:/C0 1, Just Right: 0, Slightly\nWarm: 1, Warm: 2, Very Warm: 3\nThe comfort index is defined as the reciprocal of the sum of the deviation from the ideal room temperature\nand the deviation of the feedback. We assume an ideal room temperature of 23∘C.\nC =\nX7\ni =1\n1\njRi /C0 23j + jFijðÞ (4)\nEnergy consumption is defined as the sum of the power consumption of each air conditioner. We assume\nthat power consumption is proportional to the absolute difference between the set temperature and the\nroom temperature.\nE =\nX7\ni =1\n∣Ti /C0 Ri∣ (5)\nThe objective function is defined as the weighted sum of comfort and energy consumption. The objective\nis to maximize this function.\nMaximize : wc /C1 C /C0 we /C1 E (6)\nwc (Comfort weight): 0.7\nA high weight is assigned to comfort because it directly impacts employee productivity. In particular, it is\nimportant to avoid making employees feel cold, especially when the outside temperature is low.\nwe (Energy consumption weight): 0.3\nEnergy consumption is also important, but it has less direct impact than comfort, so a slightly lower weight\nis assigned.\nThese weights were determined based on past data and the current situation. Past data indicates that\nemployees are more likely to feel dissatisfied and experience reduced productivity when the room\ntemperature is low. In addition, since the current outside temperature is low, it is important to manage\nheating appropriately and maintain a comfortable room temperature. The equations provide a\nframework for balancing comfort and energy consumption. By setting a high weight for comfort, we\ncan prioritize employee comfort while minimizing energy consumption. By comprehensively\nconsidering this information and using the above equations, the optimal set temperature for each air\nconditioner was determined.\nNote: The results of the optimal temperature prediction for HV ACs 1 through 7 in the“Optimal settings” are shown in order from the beginning of the\narray. 0 indicates shutdown, and each numerical value represents the temperature in degrees Celsius.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-31\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n In areas with many windows, intensive deployment is desirable to accurately grasp and consider the\ndifference between external and internal temperatures.\n In areas with high human traffic, prioritized deployment is recommended as temperatures fluctuate\nsignificantly.\n In areas with private rooms, installing one IoT sensor in each room can be a strategy for improving\ncomfort, for example, by enabling Agentic AI to provide room recommendations to individuals.\n In large areas, as in this experiment, deploying sensors at intervals of 7.2–9 m, which is the typical\ninstallation interval for office HVAC systems (recommended by MELRemo-IPS), allows the\ngenerative AI to consider the heating/cooling effects of each air conditioner.\n When aiming to improve comfort using generative AI, as in the proposed method, human feedback\nand actual environmental data are paired for the generative AI to determine the optimal temperature.\nIf IoT sensors are deployed too sparsely, data-driven rationality may be compromised. Therefore,\ndeploying them at a ratio of one unit per 7.2–9 m, consistent with office HVAC installation intervals,\nallows for effective monitoring of the indoor environment.\nThe relationship between inter-device distance/density and HV AC control performance could be a future\nresearch topic. Furthermore, IoT sensors have recently become inexpensive and highly functional, and\ntheir cost is considered sufficiently low compared to the benefits obtained from energy reduction, as\nshown in our experimental results.\nIn systems that aim for optimization by continuously fitting to a dynamically changing real environ-\nment, such as the cyber-physical loop (Figure 4) proposed in this article, the need for real-time\nperformance increases as the goal is to improve human comfort (or user experience) in more volatile\nenvironments. For example, scenarios requiring real-time performance include:\n Spaces with large numbers of people entering and exiting irregularly: large commercial facilities,\nairports, stations, automobiles, trains.\n Properties where comfort affects service quality: gyms, hotels, elderly care facilities.\n Spaces with drastic changes in the external environment: top floors of buildings, glass-walled\nbuildings, spaces connected to the outdoors like cafe terraces or station buildings.\nBy grasping such highly variable environments in real-time, it becomes possible to recommend optimal\nspaces for each user. For example, as in this experiment, by distinguishing which area sent individual\nfeedback and storing it as a history for a certain period, information regarding preferences such as whether\na person feels hot or cold, likes sunny places, or prefers private rooms can be obtained. In this method,\nAgentic AI searched user feedback and reflected it in HVAC control; however, since it is also easy to\nrecommend which area/space is most suitable for a user, a building system that aims for optimization by\nguiding users can be realized by considering real-time capabilities. Regarding the cost of generative AI\nassociated with real-time performance, due to the efforts of various cloud vendors, the inference cost per\nprompt has been decreasing year by year. For instance, compared to the inference cost of GPT-4 (text-\nbased) in early 2024, Gemini 1.5 Pro (multimodal), which was one of the lowest-cost generative AIs\naround autumn 2024, could perform inference at about 1/30th of the cost, and about 1/5th of the cost\ncompared to GPT-4o (multimodal). This indicates that significant cost reductions can be expected even\nwith increased real-time performance. Furthermore, as a trend, generative AIs with smaller parameter\nsizes but comparable generalization capabilities to GPT-3 or GPT-4, such as Gemma3 and Qwen3, are\nemerging. Thus, it is also possible to reduce total costs by fine-tuning these smaller models to create\nspecialized models.\n8. Conclusion and future work\nThis research introduces an “Office-in-the-Loop” system for real-world HV AC control, leveraging\ngenerative AI to optimize energy efficiency and occupant comfort in an office environment. The system\ne31-32 Tomoya Sawada et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nutilizes predicted power consumption values as a constraint for the AI model to minimize energy usage,\nsuccessfully achieving significant reductions in actual electricity consumption during field experiments.\nFew-shot learning, incorporating paired examples of user feedback and corresponding HVAC actions, is\nemployed to balance energy-saving measures with occupant comfort. The observed positive correlation\nbetween actual and predicted power consumption validates the model’s effectiveness in achieving both\nenergy efficiency and comfort goals.\nFurthermore, this research investigated the control of HV AC systems using Agentic AI capable of\nmore sophisticated reasoning. In our proposed method, we employed Data-Driven Reasoning, which\ncompels the Agentic AI to rationally explain the basis for its control decisions using acquired data. We\nconfirmed that this enables the Agentic AI to consistently arrive at the most rational solution among\nmultiple possibilities. Simulation results also indicate that employing this state-of-the-art generative AI is\nprojected to achieve significant reductions in power consumption compared to conventional operations\nwithout generative AI. Additionally, based on acquired IoT sensor data and human feedback, we tasked\nthe Agentic AI with hypothesizing a mathematical model to predict HVAC control. We verified its\ngeneralization capability, demonstrated by its ability to formulate inherent trade-offs within the office\nenvironment and provide reasoned explanations extending even to the coefficients of the derived cost\nfunction.\nWhile the system successfully reduced energy consumption and improved comfort, challenges remain\nregarding reliance on user feedback collected at 2-h intervals. Limited early morning feedback due to\nvaried work schedules (seeFigure 14a) hinders timely comfort adjustments. Furthermore, inconsistent\nfeedback collection across areas stems from dynamic workspace utilization (seeFigure 14b). Future\niterations could address these limitations by incentivizing feedback from under-represented areas or\ninferring comfort levels through occupant behavior analysis.\nOne approach to mitigate variability in feedback responses is to predict the thermal insulation\nperformance of clothing using generative AI-based camera image analysis. For instance, our verification\nusing GPT-4V demonstrated that, as illustrated inFigure 15, when a person is visible in the camera’s view,\na reasonable estimation of their clothing’s thermal insulation performance can be achieved. As a\npreprocessing step, bounding boxes were drawn on the input images beforehand using the Exceeding\nYou Only Look Once (YOLOX) object detection method (Ge et al.,2021). However, issues such as\nmissed detections of individuals and the effects of occlusion were observed, suggesting that counter-\nmeasures, such as increasing the number of cameras, may be necessary.\nDespite these limitations, the study demonstrates the potential of generative AI for achieving\nsubstantial energy savings while maintaining occupant comfort in real-world office settings. Future\nresearch will explore automating comfort feedback through behavior analysis and extending the system to\nFigure 14.Limitations in (a) the time and (b) space of the feedback.\nData-Centric Engineering e31-33\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2025.10010 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nlarger, energy-intensive facilities like data centers and industrial plants, evaluating its effectiveness in\nthese more complex contexts.\nSupplementary material.
