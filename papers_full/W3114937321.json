    "abstract": "The article describes a case study when the voltage collapse during lightning impulse tests of new power transformers was noticed and when the repeated tests finished with a positive result. The step-by-step process of reaching the conclusion on the basis of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) as a key method of the investigations was presented. The considerations on the possible source of the analysis showed that the Duval triangle method, used in the analysis of the concentration of gases dissolved in oil samples taken from bushings, more reliably and unambiguously than the ratio method recommended in the IEC 60599 Standard, indicated a phenomenon which was identified in the insulation structure of bushings analyzed. Additionally, the results from DGA were found to be consistent with an internal inspection of bushings, which showed a visible trace of discharge on the inside part of the epoxy housing, as a result of the lightning induced breakdown.",
