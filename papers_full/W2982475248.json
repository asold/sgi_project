INTRODUCTION  \nMonitoring of PD is one of the tools to identify the health condition of transformer insulation \nsystem. When PD activities are initiated, the resulting energy is transformed into different forms as \nmechanical, electrical, and chemical energy. Among all PD detection techniques, there is a growing interest \nin the PD acoustic detection method because it overcomes several disadvantages of using electrical methods \nlike low susceptibility to electromagnetic noise and cost effectiveness . \nA significant effort has been exerted to understand the behavior of the PD acoustic w ave while \ntravelling from its source to the sensor. A mathematical model was introduced in [1] by solving the acoustic \nwave governing equations through finite elements technique. The presented model describes the propagation \nof PD acoustic wave in the whol e medium (oil and steel) with contour plots to show the attenuation at \ndifferent locations. Moreover, it examined the propagation properties under the effect of changing oil density \nas the temperature increased. The effect of frequency on acoustic PD atten uation was studied in [2]  \nby applying pulses with different widths. As the frequency of PD pulse increases, this resulted in higher \nattenuation. This understanding of the PD behavior can be very helpful to predict the actual frequency ranges \nof the generated PD based on the received one. An approach in [3] presented the PD as a multiple of different \nsine waves with different frequencies and attempted to understand the interaction between them as it happens \nin PD pulse. This approach considers that all these sine waves will travel with the same velocity which is not \naccurate because each frequency will travel with different velocity as discussed by reference [4]. It has been \nmentioned that each frequency component of the PD wave will travel with different vel ocity and hence will \narrive to the tank wall at different time which will lead to a higher degree of distortion of the received  \nPD wave.  \n                ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 9, No. 6, December 2019 :  4573 - 4579 \n4574 \nThe author consider two factors that will influence the acoustic wave attenuation and dispersion. \nThe attenuation will be much greater for the high frequency component than the low frequency components. \nAlso, the velocity of high frequency will be higher t han the lower one which will result in more dispersion. \nThese two effects will be combined together to fully understand the behavior of the acoustic PD wave [4].  \nFrom the previous discussion it is apparent that there are seve ral factors that will influenc e \nthe acoustic wave starting from the instant of occurrence till it rea ches the transformer wall tank.  \nThese factors are: changing of velocity of the PD acoustic signal due to the frequency as well as the change \nin the attenuation of the different frequenc y components in the PD wave. In this paper, the propagation of \nacoustic wave in the transformer oil insulation system will be investigated considering those factors that \ninfluence its propagation by presenting a mathematical method that will be solved by f inite elements \ntechnique to detect the frequencies of the wave accopmpined with their velocities. \n \n \n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n2.1.  Partial discharge modeling \nThe PD signal can be considered as a point source of acoustic wav e with a very short duration in  \nthe ultrasonic range from 20 kHz to 1MHz [2, 5]. The exact shape of t he pressure wave resulting from  \nthe PD is not known, but it is usually assumed to be a pulse as depicted in Figure 1 [2, 6]. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. A typical waveform for the PD source \n \n \nThe acoustic wave propagation is evaluated by solving partial differential equations (PDE) using \nfinite element technique. The standard partial differential equation that governs the propagation of  \nan acoustic wave within 2-D homogeneous media is given by [5, 7]: \n \n𝜕2𝑃\n𝜕𝑡2 −𝐶2 [\n𝜕2𝑃\n𝜕𝑥2 −\n𝜕2𝑃\n𝜕𝑦2] = 𝛿(𝑥 −𝑥𝑜)𝛿(𝑦−𝑦𝑜)𝑓(𝑡) (1) \n \nWhere P is the pressure wave field in Pa, t is the time in sec, C is the acoustic wave velocity in ms -1, and 𝛿 is \nthe Dirac Delta function associated with the position of the PD source. In this paper, it is assumed that the \nsteel tank dimension is 100cm×100cm, the transformer oil density is 899 kg/m3and the PD source is assumed \nto be 25 cm away from the wall as shown in Figure 2. \nThe arrived acoustic wave at sensor (S1) location assuming the P D source, as shown in Figure 1,  \nis depicted in Figure 3. The maximum peak value of the wave can be considered as a result of the direct oil \npath for the received wave and hence the arrival time of the peak value can be considered as an actual arrival \ntime from the specified position of PD source.  It can be understood from Figure 1 and Figure 3 that several \nchanges happened to the wave during its propagation in the oil like refl ection, attenuation and change of \nfrequency. \n\nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  ISSN: 2088-8708  \n \nDetection of partial discharge acoustic emission in power transformer (Yomna O.

Frequency spectrum of partial discharge \nThe measured PD is composed of different frequencies. A typical AE PD signal measured using  \nthe setup depicted in Figure 4 is shown in Figure 5 ( a). Details about the setup can be found in [8].  The input \nwave consists of a group of frequency components which decays a t different rates [4]. Figure 5 ( b) shows \nthe frequency spectrum of the received acoustic wave that ranges from 50 -250 kHz. Instead of investigating \nthe whole pulse, pure sine waves with 50 kHz, 150 kHz and 250 kHz will be applied as a single source of \nacoustic wave to show how the system will respond to each individual frequency component. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

Wave attenuation with individual frequency components \nAs previously addressed, the input pressure was considered as a pulse that contains a lot of \nfrequency components. Hence, to understand the behavior of the whole AE PD pulse, the behavior of \nindividual frequencies (50, 150 and 250 kHz) will be studied. The individual frequency components will be \ntracked at different distances from the PD source to get the value of their attenuation. It is very important to \nnotice that the value of the sound velocity will be changed according to the frequency [4]. The velocity varies \nbetween 1000 m/s for 50 kHz and reaches 2700 m/s for 250 kHz. This variation in velocity occurred  \nas a result of the change in the acoustic impedance according to the fr equency of the pressur e source.  \nFigure 6 shows the trace of a 50 kHz frequency component in oil at the origin location, 5cm, and 15cm from  \nthe source.  \n \n \n \n(a) \n \n \n(b) \n \n(c) \n \nFigure 6. The trace of the 50 kHz frequency component as a function of distance, \n(a) The PD source (pure sine 50 kHz wave), (b) 5 cm from source, (c) 15 cm from the source \n\nInt J Elec & Comp Eng  ISSN: 2088-8708  \n \nDetection of partial discharge acoustic emission in power transformer (Yomna O. Shaker) \n4577 \nThe wave is assumed to propagate with a speed of 1000m/s and the  amplitude of the first peak of  \nthe wave decreased to about 6% at 15 cm from its original magnitude at the source.  Figure 7 shows \nthe relation between the peak value of the wave and the travelled distance from the source at different \nfrequencies (50, 150, 250 kHz). It is evident that the change in the wave attenuation  due to frequency change \nis not significant at short di stances from the source (up to 5cm). However, at longer distances, more \nattenuation is evident in the higher frequency components. Such change in the attenuation rate between  \nthe different frequency components will influence the final shape of the received wave.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7. The value of attenuation at different frequencies (50, 150, 250 kHz) with distance \n \n \n3.2.  Effect of the different AE frequency components velocities on the PD localization \nIn addition and as a result of the change in the velocity due to the variation of  \nthe frequency, the time arrival of each frequency component wil l be different. This means that  \nthe higher frequency components will reach the transformer tank wall before the  low frequency \ncomponents and this will result in further distortion in the shape of the received acoustic signal. \nTo demonstrate the effect of frequency component speed on time arrival, a new input function will \nbe investigated through the proposed model with a new locatio n for the sensor (at 80 cm from  \nthe source). The input function as depicted in Figure 8 can be considered as a multiple of sine \nwaves with different amplitudes and different frequencies as follows: \n \n30 sin 50 kHz + 50 sin 150 kHz + 20 sin 250 kHz (2) \n \n \n \n \nFigure 8. Input wave with multiple frequencies \n \n \nIt is important to study the effect of velocity changing on the arrival time as a result of frequency \nchanging. First, it will be assumed that all frequencies will travel with a  constant ve locity of 1400 m/s.  \nAs a result and as shown in Figure 9, the arrival time for the peak val ue of the received AE PD signal  \nis 584 µs. \n\n                ISSN: 2088-8708 \nInt J Elec & Comp Eng, Vol. 9, No. 6, December 2019 :  4573 - 4579 \n4578 \nOn the other hand, by using the sine waves separately with different velocities, the 20 sin 250 kHz \ncomponent in (2) will travel with the highest velocity (2700m/s). This means that the highest frequency will \narrive first compared to the other frequencies and the real arrival time of the input wave can be considered as \nthe arrival time of the highest frequency component in this input. Figure 10 shows the received acoustic wave \ndue to 250 kHz component and its arrival time which is 297µs can be con sidered as the arrival time for  \nthe whole wave described by (2). Such change in the arrival time will result in a change in the calc ulated PD \nlocation and further deformation of the received AE PD signal.  \n \n \n  \n \nFigure 9. The received acoustic wave at 80cm from \nthe source with constant velocity \n \nFigure 10. The received acoustic wave due to  \n250 kHz component only \n \n \n4.  CONCULSION \nThe output acoustic wave received by the sensor can be analyzed using its frequency components. \nEach frequency component will travel with different velocity and hence reach the sensor with different \narrival time. Moreover, the attenuation of each component  increases with the value of frequency and \ntravelled distance. By recollecting all frequency components, the distortion of the received acoustic wave \ncould be completely understood and the location can be precisely detected. \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThis work was made possible by NPRP grant 5 -044-2-016 from Qatar National Research Fund  \n(a member of Qatar Foundation).
