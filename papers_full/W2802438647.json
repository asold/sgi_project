  "abstract": "Dynamic states in the power grid – deep voltage sags and swells, voltage fluctuation – can cause faults and defects in sensitive loads and in consequence financial losses. This study presents a voltage conditioner based on a direct PWM AC/AC converter with matrix chopper cooperating with a distribution transformer, called a hybrid distribution transformer (HDT). In comparison with other solutions of hybrid and smart distribution transformers, the proposed HDT is characterised by having a simple construction and small number of power electronic switches, a wide range and continuously variable voltage control character, and good dynamic properties, in combination with a high reliability. The study contains a detailed operational description and the experimental test results of a 1 kVA rated power laboratory model. The experimental tests were conducted in a closed control‐loop with a peak detector unit in a feedback path, as well as with various types of voltage perturbation with linear and non‐linear loads. In addition, some of the properties of the proposed HDT have been compared with other similar hybrid and smart distribution transformers described in the literature.",
