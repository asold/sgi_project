    "abstract": "A novel prototype plasma coil based dry-type transformer has been built and used to create 75kV&#13;\\npeak impulse voltages from a 40kVd.c. capacitor bank. This device uses an air-cored coil of&#13;\\nexploding wire to produce a high voltage output from a copper magnet wire winding. Effective&#13;\\ninsulation coordination has been developed for the unique requirements of this device. Preliminary&#13;\\ntheories behind the mechanisms which drive this device are presented. Future improvements are&#13;\\nnoted, which are planned to allow voltages of several hundred kilovolts to be generated.",
