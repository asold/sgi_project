Higginson 1\nand on behalf of EUROIMPACT\nAbstract\nBackground: Clinicians request guidance to aid the routine use and interpretation of Patient Reported Outcome\nMeasures (PROMs), but tools are lacking. We aimed to develop a Clinical Decision Support Tool (CDST) focused on\ninformation needs, family anxiety, depression, and breathlessness (measured using the Palliative care Outcome Scale\n(POS)) and related PROM implementation guidance.\nMethods: We drafted recommendations based on findings from systematic literature searches. In a modified online\nDelphi study, 38 experts from 12 countries with different professional backgrounds, including four patient/carer\nrepresentatives, were invited to rat e the appropriateness of these reco mmendations for problems of varying\nseverity in the CDST. The quality of evidence was added for each recommendation, and the final draft CDST\nreappraised by the experts. The acco mpanying implementation guidance was built on data from literature\nscoping with expert revision (n = 11 invited experts).\nResults: The systematic literature searches identified over 560 potential references, of which 43 met the\ninclusion criteria. Two Delphi rou nds (response rate 66 % and 62 %; n = 25 and 23) found that good patient\ncare, psychosocial support and empathy, and open comm unication were central to supporting patients and\nfamilies affected by all POS concerns as a core requi rement. Assessment was recommended for increasing\nproblems (i.e. scores), followed by non-pharmacological interventions and for breathlessness and depression,\npharmacological interventions. A ccompanying PROM implementation gui dance was built based on the 8-step\nInternational Society for Quality of Life Research framework, as revised b y nine (response rate 82 %) experts.\nConclusions: This CDST provides a straightforward guide to help support clinical care and improve evidence-based\noutcomes for patients with progressive illness and their families, addressing four areas of clinical uncertainty.\nRecommendations should be used flexibly, alongside skilled individual clinical assessment and knowledge, taking\ninto account patients’ and families’ individual preferences, circumstances, and resources. The CDST is provided with\naccompanying implementation guidance to facilitate PROM use and is ready for further development and evaluation.\nKeywords: Clinical decision support tools, Delphi studies, Implem entation, Palliative care, Palliative care outcome scale\n(POS), Patient reported outcome measures\n* Correspondence: liesbeth.van_vliet@kcl.ac.uk\n1Department of Palliative Care, Policy and Rehabilitation, Cicely Saunders\nInstitute, King ’s College London, Bessemer Road, London SE5 9PJ, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n© 2015 van Vliet et al.

BMC Medicine  (2015) 13:263 \nDOI 10.1186/s12916-015-0449-6\nBackground\nProviding optimal care to patients facing life-threatening\nand progressing illnesses requires a focus on patients ’\nand their family caregivers ’ physical, psychological, emo-\ntional, and spiritual needs [1]. It is not solely a task of\nexperts in palliative care. The number of people affected\nby chronic and progressive illness is escalating, fueled by\npopulation ageing and improved life expectancy [2].\nWhile specialist palliative care services, such as hospices\nand home care teams, provide an extra layer of support\nfor those with the most complex needs, patients and\ntheir families with progressive and life threatening illness\ncome into contact with health and social care workers in\nall settings – primary, secondary, and tertiary. Providing\nholistic care for seriously ill patients and their families is\nnow a central component of health care [3]. This can,\nhowever, be daunting for many doctors, nurses and\nother staff, especially with limited formal (undergraduate\nand postgraduate) training [4, 5].\nAn important starting point in effective clinical man-\nagement is the assessment and identification of problems\n[6]. Unfortunately, practitioners often miss many of\npatients’ needs and symptoms, especially when these are\nnon-physical [7 – 11]. This problem is compounded be-\ncause patients have multiple symptoms and concerns\n[12– 14]. Asking patients to report their concerns using\nPatient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) has been\nproposed as a way to overcome this [15]. When repeated\nover time, such assessments can become measurable\noutcomes, revealing how patients ’ health status changed\nfollowing the care provided [16].\nAlthough practitioners express positive attitudes to-\nwards measuring PROMs [17, 18], routine measurement\nof concerns is hampered by a lack of training and\nguidance on how to use and respond to PROMs in clin-\nical care [17 – 19]. Published guidance on using PROMs\n[20– 22] is fragmented; it lacks specified steps and rec-\nommendations to follow when implementing PROMs\n[20, 21] or does not focus on advance disease [22]. Even\nmore pressing, there is a lack of guidance on how to re-\nspond to specific PROM scores. There is often an un-\nfamiliarity with the score interpretation [23], while\nPROM scores are potentially not fed back to the right\nperson, or reported as often as needed [24]. Clinical sig-\nnificance of health-related quality of life scores are not\nalways reported in studies [25, 26]. Unsurprisingly,\ntherefore, clinical decision-making is not often based on\noutcome scores [27] and measuring PROMS seems to\nhave a stronger impact on process-aspects of care, i.e.\ndetection of symptoms, than on outcome-aspects of\ncare, i.e. patients ’ health status (e.g. [15, 23, 28, 29]).\nIdeally, PROMs should routinely be used and assist in\ndetecting problems, planning treatment, and monitoring\nhow well concerns are alleviated.\nTo fill this gap we need specific clinical decision sup-\nport aids for specific PROM scores. This should be\nlinked with better focused guidance on how to imple-\nment PROMs in routine clinical practice. It is important\nthat both sets of guidance are developed together. This\nwill ensure specific PROMs are successfully imple-\nmented in clinical care, while at the same time clinicians\nare supported in using the PROMs when responding to\nconcerns.\nOne of the most widely used outcome measures in\nclinical practice in advanced illness is the Palliative (or\nPatient) care Outcome Scale (POS) family of measures\n(consisting of the POS, Integrated POS (IPOS), African\nPalliative Care Association African POS (APCA African\nPOS), and POS-Symptoms (POS-S)) [30]. It assesses phys-\nical symptoms, emotional, psychological, and spiritual con-\ncerns, and needs for information and support [31]. It is\nbrief (<10 minutes to complete), widely validated, able to\ntransfer across settings, has good responsiveness to\nchange, and has been translated and/or culturally\nadapted and revalidated in many different languages and\ncultures (e.g. [32 – 34]). A full suite of free user support\nresources is available at www.pos-pal.org [35]. During a\ntraining day on POS in 2013, we identified clinicians ’ need\nfor guidance in the interpretation of and responding to\nPOS scores. Most difficulties were encountered with inter-\npreting the questions regarding psychological functioning\n(i.e. depression/feeling worthwhile, n = 18/36 comments),\ninformation provision (n = 7/36 comments), and family\nanxiety (n = 4/36 comments). Breathlessness is a very dis-\nturbing symptom for patients [36, 37] and their families\n[38]. Creation of evidence-based clinical guidance on\nhow to respond to these concerns is needed.\nThe aim of this study was therefore to develop a\nClinical Decision Support Tool (CDST) for the specific\nPOS items of most concern to clinicians: information\nneeds, family anxiety, depression, and breathlessness.\nThe guidance is aimed for all practitioners and settings,\nand is applicable to all patients/family caregivers with\ncomplex needs and progressive, life-threatening and\nserious disease. Because successful implementation of\nPROMs in clinical practice is a precondition to using a\nCDST, but current guidance is fragmented, in parallel\nwe also developed accompanying guidance on PROM\nimplementation. This article reports the development\nand final formats of the CDST and implementation guid-\nance. It also offers a novel methodological approach for\nCDSTs in other areas.\nMethods\nDesign\nA systematic literature search and modified Delphi study\nwere conducted to develop the CDST. A literature\nsearch and expert consultations were used to create the\nvan Vliet et al. BMC Medicine  (2015) 13:263 Page 2 of 20\nPROMs implementation guidance. Ethical approval was\ngranted by the Research Ethical Committee of King ’s\nCollege London (BDM/13/14-3). Participants were ex-\nplained that participation implied informed consent.\nClinical Decision Support Tool (CDST)\nThe CDST on how to respond to different levels of re-\nported POS scores on information needs, family anxiety,\ndepression, and breathlessness was created using a system-\natic literature search to develop preliminary recommenda-\ntions for clinical care, followed by a modified Delphi\napproach to determine how the recommendations should\nbe applied for different levels of POS score severity.\nSystematic literature search\nSearch strategy\nTo develop draft recommendations we searched for\nguidelines and systematic reviews on the aforementioned\ntopics in PubMed, Google Scholar (first 4 pages),\nCochrane Database, and the York DARE database (2000\nto end June 2013). The websites of NICE (UK), National\nGuideline Clearinghouse (US), the Canadian Medical\nAssociation, and google.com (first 4 pages) were hand\nsearched for relevant guidelines. Three guides on using\nPROMS were screened for relevant information [20 – 22]\n(see Additional file 1 for search strategies).\nInclusion criteria were:\ni). Guidelines/systematic reviews focusing on general\npalliative care, or focusing on information needs,\nfamily anxiety, depression, or breathlessness in\npalliative care (sources focusing on palliative care in\na specific setting were included)\nii). Guidelines/systematic reviews published in English/\nDutch/German/Italian (languages available in the\nstudy team)\niii). Guidelines from national (disease) organizations\niv). Guidelines providing an evidence-base for created\nrecommendation\nv). Systematic reviews published in peer-reviewed journals\nExclusion criteria were guidelines/systematic reviews:\ni). Not focusing solely on palliative care (but on the\nentire trajectory of disease(s))\nii). Focusing on a specific disease\niii). Focusing solely on pediatric care\niv). Of which an updated version was available\nv). Of which no full-text was available\nData extraction\nData from included sources on how to clinically respond\nto information needs, family anxiety, depression, and\nbreathlessness was extracted (by LV).\nAnalysis\nLV drafted recommendations based on the extracted evi-\ndence. These were then critically revised by the co-\nauthors (RH, CB, SP). Two authors (LV/IH) finalized the\ndraft recommendations which were then taken forward\ninto the subsequent modified Delphi study.\nModified Delphi study\nWe conducted a two-round online Delphi-study [39, 40]\n(hosted via internet platform Keypoint), to appraise and\nrevise the draft recommendations and agree an expert\nconsensus on the appropriateness of all recommenda-\ntions for all scores on the POS items.\nParticipants\nOverall, 38 experts were purposefully sampled (we\napproached 48, of which 10 declined beforehand); com-\nprising 26 clinicians, 24 researchers (some had a dual\nrole), and 4 patient/family re presentatives (as experts\nby experience, recruited via the UK National Council\nof Palliative Care and the European Cancer Patient\nCoalition). Experts came from the UK, US, Netherlands,\nItaly, Germany, Australia, South Africa, Belgium, Greece,\nSweden, Poland, and Switzerland. Experts were chosen\nbased on their expertise in the field of the topics under\nstudy.\nRatings\nIn the Delphi round 1, experts rated the appropriateness\nof recommendations for all the different answer categor-\nies (0 – 4) for each POS-item and provided comments\nand/or suggested revisions. Appropriateness was rated\non a 1 – 9 scale ( ‘not at all appropriate ’ to ‘extremely ap-\npropriate’) with a ‘do not know ’ option and space for\ncomments. In round 2, a summary of the results of\nround 1 was provided (median, range, interquartile\nranges, summary qualitative remarks) which participants\nwere asked to take into account when rating the recom-\nmendations again. The results of round 1 were circu-\nlated. If recommendations in round 2 achieved a median\nranging 7 – 9 and did not have >30 % of scores in the\n1– 3a n d7 – 9 range, they were deemed as appropriate\n[41– 43] and included in the CDST. Lastly, the draft\nCDST was commented upon by (the same, plus one\nadditional) experts via ema il and in a face-to-face re-\nsearch meeting (with different researchers).\nQuality of evidence\nFor each recommendation, the quality of evidence was\ndetermined, using an adapted GRADE approach [44]\nwith the classifications: A (e.g. meta-analysis, systematic\nreview of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), RCT), B\n(e.g. cohort studies, case – control studies), C (e.g. retro-\nspective, poor quality cohort studies), and D (qualitative\nvan Vliet et al. BMC Medicine  (2015) 13:263 Page 3 of 20\nstudies, expert opinion) quality evidence. We rated each\nrecommendation using the most recent and highest level\nof known evidence (based on design). If sources already\nprovided a quality rating, their rating was used. Additional\nfile 2 depicts how quality ratings from each source were\nmapped to the ABCD framework.\nAccompanying guidance on implementing PROMs\nWe scoped the literature for relevant guidance on imple-\nmenting PROMs. Data was extracted from these sources\nto develop (with assistance of several experts in the field)\na draft implementation guidance linked to our specific\nPROM, the POS. Next, we invited comments and critical\nrevisions via email from the 10 members of the European\nAssociation for Palliative Care (EAPC) Taskforce Outcome\nMeasures (we approached 13, of which three declined\nbeforehand), plus one additional expert who agreed to\nparticipate, representing the countries of the UK, US,\nGermany, Australia, Italy, Belgium, and South Africa. A fi-\nnalized version was created with comments from one add-\nitional expert.\nResults\nClinical Decision Support Tool (CDST)\nSystematic literature search\nOur search of the online databases revealed 703 sources\n(564 after duplication removal) of which 31 were\nincluded (see Fig. 1 for the flowchart of inclusion) [45 – 75].\nTwo additional guidelines [76, 77] were added as they were\nreferred to by two included references [49, 73]. In addition,\nnine extra guidelines were included from the screened\nwebsites [78– 86]. As panic/anxiety is often associated with\nbreathlessness, we screened the NICE and Clearinghouse\nwebsites and all included guidelines for additional sources,\nrevealing one additional source [87]. Therefore, ultimately\n43 sources were included.\nAll included sources were scrutinized for evidence-\nbased conclusions, data and recommendations on how\nto clinically respond to information needs, family\nanxiety, depression, and breathlessness in palliative care.\nOverall, 47 recommendations were drafted to be rated in\nthe Delphi Round 1. Not all included sources provided\ninformation that could be used to draft recommenda-\ntions, e.g. one review focusing on the effect of home-\nbased palliative care found inconsistent results. As no\nother source focused on this topic, no recommendations\nabout home-based care were made [72].\nModified Delphi study\nIn total, 25/38 (66 %) of our experts participated in\nround 1. Open comments were used to adjust wordings\nof several recommendations (services should be ‘offered’\ninstead of ‘provided’; pharmacological interventions should\nbe ‘offered, alongside non-pharmacological interventions’).\nFor round 2, experts were asked to take into account a\nsummary of the qualitative and quantitative results of\nround 1. In this second round, 62 % (23/37, one person\nwithdrew from the project) of the experts participated.\nDemographic characteristics of participating experts in\nrounds 1 and 2 are displayed in Additional file 3. Open\ncomments (services should be provided, ‘depending on re-\nsources’; psycho-education,‘i.e. teaching, explanation’)w e r e\nused to finalize the recommendations, while the predefined\ncut-offs were used to draft the CDST. Quality of evidence\nwas added for each recommendation, ranging from high to\nvery low (later adapted to A – D). One recommendation\n(regarding chest-wall vibration to treat breathlessness) was\ndowngraded from A to B as evidence was based on labora-\ntory (as opposed to clinical) studies.\nFinal clinical decision support tool\nTwo formats of a decision-diagram for each POS item\nand a manual of the CDST were created and again sent\nout to all experts, of which 41 % (15/37) provided com-\nments, in addition to one other expert in the field. Main\ncomments focused on making it clear that for higher\nPOS scores, lower recommendations still apply and\ncreating both a short and long manual, while both\nformats of the decision diagrams were equally pre-\nferred (also in the face-to-face researchers meeting).\nThe final decision-diagrams are depicted in Figs. 2, 3, 4,\n5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. Additional file 4 depicts the short manual\nwhile the long manual can be found at the Palliative care\nOutcome Scale website [35]. Independent of POS score,\ncore recommendations center on: i) good patient care,\nii) the provision of psychosocial support and empathy,\nand iii) the use of open communication. Proper as-\nsessment is needed for increasing scores, followed by\nnon-pharmacological interventions, and pharmaco-\nlogical interventions for high levels of depression and\nbreathlessness.\nImplementation guidance\nOur scoping identified four major guides which had\ncomplementary approaches: i) the PROMs guidelines of\nthe International Society for Quality of Life Research\n(ISOQOL) including an 8-step framework [22], ii) the\nOutcome Measures in Palliative Care booklet [20],\niii) the White paper on Outcome Measures of the\nEAPC [21], and iv) for the POS family of measures,\nthe Guidelines for using the POS [88]. To provide\nguidance on implementing PROMs in clinical practice, the\nISOQOL’ [22] 8-step framework was followed. The 8 steps\ninclude i) identify goals for collecting PROMs; ii) select\npatients, setting, and timing of assessment; iii) determine\nwhich questionnaire to use; iv) choose a mode for\nadministering/scoring the questionnaire; v) design pro-\ncesses for reporting results, vi) identify aids to facilitate\nvan Vliet et al.

In\npalliative care, this can be difficult, in which case proxy rating is used\n(family or professional). Measuring both patient and proxy ratings is ideal.\nFamily carers ’ own needs should be measured\nSetting: Measurement can be done both within/outside the clinical setting\nand within/between visits\nTiming: For screening PROMs are used once, for monitoring more often.\nMeasurement frequency and questionnaire length should be related. Some\nargue that, ideally, no change in ‘window of measurement ’ should be made.\nHowever, flexibility might be needed, e.g. following a change in situation\nor depending on patient preference\nPOS measures\nPOS measures have patient (all), family (POS), and staff (POS, IPOS) versions\nBoth screening and monitoring is possible\nThe measurement window of POS measures are either 3 ((APCA African)\nPOS, IPOS) or 7 days (POS-S, IPOS). In practice, POS measures can be\nmeasured more flexibly, in response to clinical circumstances\n3 Determine which questionnaire to use Take several factors into consideration in choosing outcome measure\ne.g., aim of use, questionnaire available\nChoose outcome measure based on evidence, with sound psychometric\nproperties and suited for the clinical task\nUse multidimensional (specific or generic) measures which allow for\ncomparisons across settings and countries\nPOS measures:\nPOS (individual items and total score) has good psychometric properties.\nPOS-S/APCA African POS are validated, IPOS is being validated\nPOS measures are holistic, translated, can be used in various settings and\ndiseases and in clinical practice (e.g. to enhance patient management and\nas a quality improvement tool)\n4 Choose a mode for administering/scoring the questionnaire PROMS can be collected using self- and interview-administration,\nwhile computer-completion is efficient\nExplain to patients why PROMS are helpful\nPilot the measure with a few patients\nPOS measures\nThere are several ways to administer POS measures: i) leave the measure\nwith the patient (provide written or verbal information), ii) stay with the\npatient (patient self-completes or practitioner helps), or iii) integrate\nmeasurement into holistic assessment (staff version – for specialists only)\n5 Design processes for reporting results PROM results should be shared with other health care practitioners\n(who can provide assistance in how to respond to certain issues) and\nthe patient (it can integrate them as active member of the team)\nDecide how to present results, e.g. numerical info (easy to generate) and/or\ngraphic representations (easy to interpret over time, but might be more\nvan Vliet et al.

We found it was necessary to\nhave both core recommendations, applicable for all symp-\ntom levels, as well as responses that could be titrated up\nwith increasingly severe sy mptom scores. Accompanying\nguidance on PROM implementation was also developed,\nusing an 8-step approach.

Our provided guidance might\nassist in this development while overcoming some of the\nperceived barriers of implementing PROMs, most notably a\nlack of knowledge and education [6, 91].\nThe CDST can assist clinicians in responding to the psy-\nchosocial aspects of clinical care which they may feel less\nconfident in delivering. Across the several symptoms in-\ncluded in our Delphi, for higher scores, more intensive clin-\nical responses seem warranted. Ensuring the core\nrecommendations (good patient care; providing psychosocial\nsupport and empathy; the use of open communication) are\nin place remains vital in these situations. These core recom-\nmendations reflect previous study findings, showing that pa-\ntients expect their clinicians to show both technical\ncompetence [92] as well as seeing them as an individual per-\nson [93]. Empathy becomes increasingly important in pro-\ngressing disease [94], while most medical complaints are\nrelated to communication deficits [95, 96], adding not only\nto patient but also caregiver di stress [97]. Our CDST postu-\nlates that proper assessment should be followed by non-\npharmacological interventions which can be progressed to\npharmacological interventions in the more medical oriented\nsymptoms of breathlessness and depression. However, also\nin these domains, there seems a preference for psychosocial\ninterventions. Indeed, a recent RCT showed that a short-\nterm service provided by palliative care, respiratory,\nphysiotherapy, and occupational therapy improved breath-\nless patients’ outcomes [98]. This service combined pharma-\ncological review with a focus on non-pharmacological\ninterventions such as pacing and relaxation.\nAlthough originally developed for the POS family of mea-\nsures, the core recommendations point towards the potential\nusefulness of our CDST for other PROMs covering similar\ndomains (e.g. the Edmonton S ymptom Assessment System\n[99], the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire [100], or qual-\nity of life measures such as the EORTC-QLQC30 [101]). It\nis a wider problem that in advanced illness patients ’ and\ncaregivers’ psychosocial needs often remain unmet\n[102, 103]. A recent systematic review, including but not\nlimited to POS, concluded that feeding back PROM data\nin palliative care influenced patients ’ psychosocial out-\ncomes the most [104]. Our CDST might strengthen this\nfinding by generalizing its applicability beyond POS.\nAlthough the CDST proposals are based on scientific evi-\ndence combined with expert opinion, this tool is not\nintended to be prescriptive. Instead, it aims to help practi-\ntioners think through the best decision towards difficult\nand complex encountered problems. Being too prescrip-\ntive can be counterproductive, especially because in ad-\nvanced illness patients and families have complex and\noften quite individual needs, circumstances, and\ntrajectories, which interact [1, 105]. Instead the CDST\nshould be used as the name implies, as a support, to aid a\nwider range of aspects to be considered when making\ntreatment choices, alongside skilled individual clinical as-\nsessment and knowledge, taking into account patients ’\nand families ’ individual preferences, circumstances and\navailable resources. In areas of uncertainty or conflict, spe-\ncialist support or a second opinion should be obtained.\nThe CDST should not be used as an endpoint ( ‘tick-box’\nexercise) in itself but as a starting point to achieve high\nquality person-centered care and good clinical practice.\nAs the implementation guide makes clear, training and\nongoing support will be an essential component.\nThis study has limitations. Our sample size was relatively\nsmall, although it should be noted that the responses rates\nin the online Delphi (66 % vs 62 %) are in line with a previ-\nous similar study in this field [106]. Next, we asked partici-\npants in the Delphi study to review a wide area of topics,\nwhich might have been challenging, especially surrounding\nthe specific topic of breathlessness. However, as palliative\ncare focuses on physical, psychological, emotional, and spir-\nitual issues, we anticipated most participants to have (some)\nknowledge in all domains and added a ‘do not know ’ op-\ntion in the Delphi. The quality rating should also be inter-\npreted with caution as we used an adapted GRADE\napproach. Many sources used different rating systems and\nwe followed sources ’ own evidence-levels if already pro-\nvided. No strength of recommendation (representing\nwhether desirable effects of recommendations clearly\noutweigh (or not) undesirable effects [44]) was provided\ndue to the heterogeneity of used quality ratings and the\nenvisaged applicability of our recommendations in dif-\nferent settings and countries. Lower ratings do not ne-\ncessarily imply that these recommendations are not\nimportant, as they were among the highest rated rec-\nommendations by our expert panel (e.g. the provision\nof emotional support and respect for cultural/religious\ntraditions when handling family anxiety). These ratings\nalso highlight the pressing need for more high-quality\nresearch studies to build the evidence-base of these and\nother key components of palliative care. For example,\nthe use of a fan was labelled as ‘no evidence ’ based on\na Cochrane review [59]. However, this is still in the\nearly stages of evaluation, with recent studies showing\nconflicting effects (e.g. [107, 108]). As fans are inexpen-\nsive, unlike to cause any harm and have low side ef-\nfects, they can be worth trying. Another limitation\nentailed that we only included sources that focused on\npalliative care in general and not on specific diseases as\nwe sought recommendations that were applicable\nacross diseases. For some diseases, the evidence might\npropose alternative strategies; however, we would ex-\npect experts in those fields to be aware of this evidence\nto take it into consideration. Although we used a broad\nvan Vliet et al. BMC Medicine  (2015) 13:263 Page 16 of 20\nsearch strategy, relevant sources might have been\nmissed. Furthermore, we refer in footnotes to the Ci-\ncely Saunders Institute ’s Breathlessness Intervention\nService and the Vitaltalk organization for more re-\nsources on breathlessness and information needs. These\nwere not found via our search strategies (as they are\nvery recent), but we believed them to be of importance\nto clinical care. Finally, due to time and resource con-\nstraints, only one author identified resources and ex-\ntracted data of included sources. That being said, a\nmajor strength of this work includes the involvement of\npatients and families in the development of the CDST\nand the combination of evidence-based recommenda-\ntions with clinician expertise. Future studies can use\nthis study as a starting point in developing evidence-\nbased CDST for advanced disease, and should now re-\nfine our proposed CDST, test its effect on patient and\nfamily outcomes, and develop CDST for other POS\nitems.\nConclusions\nOur findings underline the importance of providing good\npatient care, psychosocial support and empathy, and com-\nmunication in advanced disease for all patients and\nfamilies, irrespective of POS scores, in the domains\nof information needs, family anxiety, depression, and\nbreathlessness. For increasing scores, patients ’ symptoms\nshould be assessed and responded to with non-\npharmacological interventions, followed by pharmaco-\nlogical interventions (for breathlessness and depression).\nWe were able to develop these recommendations into a\nCDST. Our novel evidenced-based approach to develop a\nCDST offers a replicable method for other areas. By using\nthe presented recommendations alongside skilled clinical\nknowledge and patient preferences and ongoing training,\nit aims to help support clinicians provide the best pos-\nsible patient-centered care and patients and their families\nachieve the best possible outcomes in highly threatening\ntimes. Systematically following the 8-step framework can\nsupport successful implementation of PROMS, and POS,\nin advanced disease.\nAdditional files\nAdditional file 1: Search strategy.
