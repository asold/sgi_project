  "abstract": "With the rapid development of information technology, Financial Shared Service Centers (FSSC) have gradually become a core model in corporate financial management. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs), as an important technology in the field of natural language processing, have been widely applied across various industries. This paper aims to explore the application of LLMs in FSSCs, analyzing their impact on financial data processing, intelligent analysis, report generation, and customer service. Through case studies, this paper demonstrates how LLMs improve financial processing efficiency and optimize customer service experience, while also addressing challenges in data privacy, model accuracy, and technical implementation. Finally, the paper offers strategic recommendations for the intelligent transformation of FSSCs and looks ahead to the future development potential of LLMs in this field.",
