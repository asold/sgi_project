INTRODUCTION \nThe power supply system (PSS) of a major city is, as a rule, the component \nof a regional or a state power system. Such a system has networks of several \nvoltage levels, a nd is continuously developing. It is very important to develop the \nsystem rationally and to take timely correct decisions as to the formation of the \nwhole system and of its separate parts. Every urban PSS is formed historically, \nwith a certain hierarchy of voltages in its networks. As a rule, in the urban PSSs the \nvoltage levels of 400 (330)/110 (220)/10 (20) kV are used.  \n2. HIERARCHY OF VOLTAGES AND LOAD DENSITIES  \nIN THE URBAN POWER SUPPLY SYSTEMS \nThe total electric load  of a city is formed by the electr ic power of various \ngroups of consumers. This load should be provided by the necessary total power of \nthe urban transformer substations (ТSs). The optimum capacity of the urban TSs in \nthe networks of different voltage depends on the load density in the city and in its \nseparate areas. The load densities in separate areas of a city differ from the average \nload density in this city and, in tu rn, depend on the specifics of territorial building, \nits typical number of storeys, the level of electrification, and the voltage level at the \nconsumers’ connections to the PSS.  The load density on each voltage level is \ndetermined by the total load of cons umers on the previous level and the additional \nload on the level under consideration. As a result, the load densities in the networks \nof a PSS form the hierarchy corresponding to that of network voltages. The average \n10.2478/v10047-009-0025-y \n 17 \ndensities of loads on each  voltage level in a 330 (400) /110/10 –20/0.4 kV power \nsupply system, beginning from the lowest, are: \ncity\nS\n 4,0\n0\nΣ\n;                                                          (1) \ncity\nS\n 2010\n1\nΣ\n;                                                       (2) \ncity\nS\n 110\n2\nΣ\n;                                                          (3) \ncity\nS\n )400(330\n3\nΣ\n,                                                   (4) \nwhere \n0,4,0 ΣS  is the total load of consumers and the load density on the \n0.4 kV busbars of transformer substations;  \n1,2010 ΣS\n  is the same for the 10–20 kV busbars of TSs;  \n2,110 ΣS\n  – the same for the 110 kV busbars of TSs;  \n3,)400(330 ΣS\n  − the same for the 330 (400) кV busbars of TSs;  \ncity\n  is the city territory suitable for building. \nThe following relations between the load densities exist for different voltage \nlevels: \nError! Objects cannot be created from editing field codes.                                                                              \n(5) \nwhere \n1,ok  is a factor of simultaneity for the maximum load of 10 –20/0.4 kV \ntransformers depending on the TS number in a 10–20 kV network;  \n2,ok\n is a factor of simultaneity for the maximum load of 110 –10/20 kV \ntransformers depending on the TS number in a 110 kV network;  \n3,ok\n is a factor of a simultaneity for the maximum load of 330  (400)/ \n110 kV transformers depending on the TS number in a 330  kV \nnetwork. \nThe hierarchy of voltages and load densities in urban networks is presented \nschematically in Fig. 1. \nFrom (1–5) it follows that the actual load densities on each voltage level  are \ndiffering because of different TS numbers and factors of  simultaneity for the \nmaximum load of transformers in the networks of a PSS. \n 18 \n \nFig.1. The hierarchy of voltages and load densities in the urban electric networks.  \nIf the consumers’ loads and the territory of a city (or its part) allocated for \nbuilding are known, the average load density in this city (or its part) on a g iven \nvoltage level in the general form is: \ncity\ncity\niav\nS\n,\n,                                                        (6) \nwhere  \ni,av is the average load density in a network on the  i-th voltage level, \nMVA/km2;  \ncityS\n is the total electrical load of the city (or its part) on a given voltage \nlevel in the PSS, MVA;  \ncity\n is the territory of the city (or its part ) allocated for building, km2. \nThe total electrical load of the city (or its part) on a given voltage level of the \nPSS in the general form will be: \ninomii\nTS\ni\niTS\nTS\ni\ncity SnkSkS\nn\nTS\nn\nTS ioio ,\n1\n,\n1 ,, \n\n ,                      (7) \nwhere  \niTSS ,  is the load of the i-th transformer substation, MVA;  \n 19 \nTSiok ,\n  is the factor of simultaneity for the  maximum load of transformers \ndepending on the TS  number in the network on a given voltage \nlevel;  \nni  is the number of transformers in the substation;  \ni\n  is the load factor of the i-th transformer in the substation;  \ninomS ,\n  is the rated power of transformers in the  i-th substation, MVA;  \nTSn\n  is the number  of transformer substations in the city (or its part). \n3. MODELLING OF THE SERVICE AREA OF A TRANSFORMER SUBSTATION \nTo provide qualitative el ectricity supply for all the consumers of a city they \nare to be rationally distributed among separate transformer substations according to \ntheir service area.  \nThe service area of each separate substation is defined by the load density in \nthis area and the  TS load, which, in turn, depends on the rated power of a \ncorresponding transformer, the number of transformers  at the substation, and the \nload factor: \niTS\ninomii\niTS\niTS\niTS\nSnS\n,\n,\n,\n,\n, \n\n\n\n ,                                           (8) \nwhere \niTS,  is the load density in the service area of the i-th substation. \nIn the absence of a uniform approach to the modelling, these areas can have \ncomplicated geometrical forms sometimes differing for each substation. This \nmakes difficult the choice of the location for n ew substations and the purposeful \ndevelopment of the electricity supply scheme.  \nThe service area of a transformer substation can be modelled by diversified \ngeometrical figures: a circle, a square, a regular hexagon, etc.. The most convenient \nmodel is a h exagon, which enables  filling practically any shape territory of \nbuilding in regular order (Figs. 2, 3). This model of TS service area is chosen in the \nwork as a uniform model -template that will be useful at the decision -making \nconcerning the development o f city networks. It is conditionally accepted that the \ntransformer substation should be at the hexagon centre (in real circumstances it \nshould not fall outside the borders of the hexagon). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig. 2.

DEPENDENCES OF THE TS SERVICE AREA AND ITS RADIUS  \nON THE LOAD DENSITY \nThe adopted model of the TS service area allows designing templates (of \nhexagonal shape) of such an area for substations of any voltage. According to the \nadopted model, we can determine the maximum ad missible and the actual service \nareas and their radiuses.  \nTo solve this task it is necessary to have information on: \n  the load density in different districts of the city;  \n the installed or designed rated power of the transformer (optimal at the    \nexisting load density or accepted based on the operating experience); \n  the number of transformers at the TSs;  \n actual or accepted admissible load factor of transformers.  \nThe accepted admissible load factor of transformers should be economically \njustified (without unreasonable excess of the installed power in a network) and \nallowing the overload level admissible for transformers in compliance with \n 22 \nspecifications IEC 354 -91. Usually, a new transformer substation is able to reach \nthe planned estimated load n ot earlier than five years after the beginning of \noperation. It is desirable after reaching the estimated load to schedule some reserve \nof the TS installed load for a definite time without TS and network reconstruction.  \nThe accepted admissible load factor  of transformers enables us to check \nwhether the actual service area of the existing substation corresponds to the \nmaximum admissible service area and to draw conclusions about the necessity of \nre-structuring the old TSs or constructing a new one. For new prospective sub -\nstations it is possible to calculate both the maximum permissible and the real (at the \nreal load factor) service areas as well as the TS radiuses. The difference between \nthe maximum permissible and the real service areas allows estimation o f the \nreserve for the load increase at a future ТS.   \nThe results of calculation are exemplified by Table 1, where the data on the \nservice areas and radiuses of 110 kV two -transformer TSs depending on the load \ndensity are presented. The admissible load fac tor of transformers in the normal \nmode is accepted to be βb = 0.5 for two-transformer substations (typical of the Riga \ncity networks). Such factor allows holding a permanent load for the second \ntransformer no higher than the rated load in the case of switc hing-off the first \ntransformer. This suggestion, however, has not yet been well-founded. \nAt the accepted admissible load factor the maximum admissible ТS service \narea and its radius are obtained. The TS service area and its radius at different \nvalues of load factor can be calculated by expressions (13), (14). \n \nTable 1 \nService area ПТS and its radius R for 110 кV two-transformer substations  \ndepending on load density σ2 \n βb = 0.5 \nσ2, \nMVA/km2 \nΠTS, km2 R, km \nn x Snom n x Snom \n2x16 2x25 2x32 2x40 2x63 2x16 2x25 2x32 2x40 2x63 \n3 5.33 8.33 10.67 13.33 21.35 1.43 1.79 2.03 2.27 2.87 \n5 3.20 5.00 6.40 8.00 12.81 1.11 1.39 1.57 1.76 2.22 \n8 2.00 3.13 4.00 5.00 8.01 0.88 1.10 1.24 1.39 1.76 \n10 1.60 2.50 3.20 4.00 6.41 0.79 0.98 1.11 1.24 1.57 \n13 1.23 1.92 2.46 3.08 4.93 0.69 0.86 0.97 1.09 1.38 \n15 1.07 1.67 2.13 2.67 4.27 0.64 0.80 0.91 1.01 1.28 \n17 0.94 1.47 1.88 2.35 3.77 0.60 0.75 0.85 0.95 1.20 \n20 0.80 1.25 1.60 2.00 3.20 0.56 0.69 0.79 0.88 1.11 \n23 0.70 1.09 1.39 1.74 2.79 0.52 0.65 0.73 0.82 1.04 \n25 0.64 1.00 1.28 1.60 2.56 0.50 0.62 0.70 0.79 0.99 \n27 0.59 0.93 1.19 1.48 2.37 0.48 0.60 0.68 0.76 0.96 \n30 0.53 0.83 1.07 1.33 2.14 0.45 0.57 0.64 0.72 0.91 \n33 0.49 0.76 0.97 1.21 1.94 0.43 0.54 0.61 0.68 0.86 \n36 0.44 0.69 0.89 1.11 1.78 0.41 0.52 0.59 0.65 0.83 \n 23 \nIn Figs. 4 –7, the dependences of service area ПTS  for 110/10–20 kV and \n10–20/0.4 kV transformer substations and service radius R on the load densities at  \ncorresponding voltage levels are shown. \nThe obtained analytical expressions (13, 14), the tabulated results of \ncalculations and the graphic dependences (Figs. 4–7) made it possible to determine \nspecific features of the TS service areas and its radiuses. \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n3 8 13 18 23 28 33\ns  , MVA/km\n2\n?

The \nmethod facilitates and systematizes the arrangement of TSs to be built in the city \nterritory at development of networks.  \nFor arrangement of templates on the city map (or its part) the geometrical \nsizes of templates can be determined by expressions (13 –15).

Using the calculation program EXCEL and \nthe graphic program AUTOCAD it is possible to automate the process of arranging \nthe service areas on the city’s map. The developed method allows m aking the \nsubstantiated decisions on the development of networks at the initial design levels \nin the conditions of incompleteness of the primary information.  \n5.

Borscevskis, \nK o p s a v i l k u m s \nDarbā piedāvāta vienotā un teorētiski pamatota pieeja jauno apakšstaciju \nizvietojuma izvēlei un apkalpes zonas noteikšanai. Uzdevuma risināšanai veikta \napakšstaciju apkalpes zonu modelēšana. Transformatoru apakšstacijas apkalpes zo-\nna modelēta ar pareizo sešstūri. Šis modelis dod iespēju aizpildīt praktiski jebkura s \nformas apbūves rajona laukumu. Noteikti transformatoru apakšstacijas apkalpes \nzonu izmēri, kuri ir atkarīgi no transformatoru apakšstacijas slodzes un slodzes \nblīvuma apkalpes zonā. Slodzes blīvumi atsevišķos pilsētas rajonos, mikrorajonos \nvai apakšstaci ju apkalpes zonās atšķiras no vidējā lieluma pilsētā ievērojamās \nrobežās atkarībā no apbūves veida, apbūves stāvu skaita, sadzīves elektrificēšanas \nlīmeņa, patērētāju pieslēgšanas vietas (sprieguma pakāpes) elektroapgādes sistēmā. \nFaktiski slodzes blīvumi katrai sprieguma pakāpei ir dažādi, veicot slodzes blīvuma \nhierarhiju saskaņā ar tīklu spriegumu hierarhiju. Spriegumu un slodzes blīvuma \nhierarhija attēlota grafiskā veidā un teorētiski analizētas slodzes blīvumu sakarības \nstarp dažādām pakāpēm. Iegūtas apkalpes zonu un to rādiusu atkarības no slodzes \nblīvuma 110/10–20 kV un 10–20/0.4 kV transformatoru apakšstacijām. \nPieņemtais transformatoru apakšstaciju apkalpes zonas modelis un iegūtās \nmatemātiskās sakarības starp modeļa pamatizmēriem do d iespēju izstrādāt apakš -\nstaciju apkalpes zonas šablonus sešstūra veidā. Ar ģeometriskiem šabloniem, zinot \noptimālo vai pieņemto transformatoru jaudu, var racionāli sadalīt pilsētas apbūves \nteritoriju starp transformatoru apakšstacijām.  \nĢeometriskos šablonus var izmantot kā perspektīvo apakšstaciju racionālam \nizvietojumam pilsētas teritorijā, tā esošo apakšstaciju izvietojuma koriģēšanai \nrekonstrukcijas gadījumā. Rezultātā pilsētas elektroapgādes shēmas attīstība notiek \nnevis haotiski, bet mērķtiecīgi. \nAr aprēķinu programmu EXCEL un grafisko programmu AUTOCAD var \nautomatizēt transformatoru apakšstaciju izvietojuma procedūru pilsētas kartē. \n17.08.2009.
