Roy1,2,5\nTool-use changes both peripersonal space and body representations, with several effects being \nnowadays termed tool embodiment. Since somatosensation was typically accompanied by vision \nin most previous tool use studies, whether somatosensation alone is sufficient for tool embodiment \nremains unknown. Here we address this question via a task assessing arm length representation at an \nimplicit level. Namely, we compared movement’s kinematics in blindfolded healthy participants when \ngrasping an object before and after tool-use. Results showed longer latencies and smaller peaks in the \narm transport component after tool-use, consistent with an increased length of arm representation. No \nchanges were found in the hand grip component and correlations revealed similar kinematic signatures \nin naturally long-armed participants. Kinematics changes did not interact with target object position, \nfurther corroborating the finding that somatosensory-guided tool use may increase the represented \nsize of the participants’ arm. Control experiments ruled out alternative interpretations based upon \naltered hand position sense. In addition, our findings indicate that tool-use effects are specific for \nthe implicit level of arm representation, as no effect was observed on the explicit estimate of the \nforearm length. These findings demonstrate for the first time that somatosensation is sufficient for \nincorporating a tool that has never been seen, nor used before.\nOver the last decades, several studies have contributed characterizing the phenomenon of tool embodiment fol-\nlowing use. To date, many aspects have been described, making the theoretical framework of tool embodiment \nquite rich and articulated. Indeed, after the seminal work in monkeys by Iriki and collaborators\n1, it is nowa-\ndays widely accepted that tool-use leads to modifications in the multisensory peripersonal space in humans 2–4. \nMore recent work highlighted that tool use can also change body representations 5–8. Numerous approaches, \nfrom perceptual to more action-related ones, have been pursued to assess tool incorporation into different body \nrepresentations (see, for review\n9) among which the implicit body representation for action, often termed body \nschema in contraposition to body image, a more explicit and conscious body representation10,11.\nDifferent senses contribute to tool embodiment: typically, multisensory integration is necessary for tool use \neffects to emerge when perception in the peripersonal space is assessed 7,12–16. Instead, mere vision of tool-use \nis sufficient to modify either tactile distance perception on the body 17, or tasks impinging on reachability esti-\nmates18. Here, we assessed the role of somatosensation for incorporation of tool into the implicit body representa-\ntion for action, assessing the changes in movement kinematics as a proxy for body representation update.\nBody representation for action is indeed conceived as a highly plastic representation reflecting the different \nchanges our body undergoes: from the slow growth in size from birth to adulthood, to the sudden size changes \nproduced by transient functional lengthening during tool manipulation. When we use tools to achieve a particu-\nlar goal, our body size and structure change abruptly, which is thought to be reflected in the update of the implicit \nbody representation\n19. For example, grasping with a mechanical grabber modifies, in few minutes, participants’ \n1Laboratoire Dynamique du Langage, CNRS UMR 5596, University Lyon 2, Lyon, France. 2University of Lyon, Lyon, \nFrance. 3The Brain and Mind Institute, Western University, London, ON, Canada. 4ImpAct Team, CRNL INSERM \nU1028, CNRS UMR5292, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, University UCBL Lyon 1, Lyon, France. 5Center for \nMind/Brain Sciences (CIMeC), University of Trento, Rovereto, Italy. 6IRIT, CNRS, Toulouse, France. 7iPAL, cnRS, \nSingapore, Singapore. 8Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialisation, University of Padova, Padova, \nItaly. 9Hospices Civils de Lyon, Mouvement et Handicap & Neuro-immersion, Lyon, France.

In previous work, we asked participants to grasp and point to an object with their \nright hand before and after using a 40 cm-long mechanical grabber with the same right hand. The kinematics \nof both free-hand grasping and pointing movements performed after tool use was modified in a specific and \nselective way: only the arm-related component of the movement (called transport component) was modified, dis-\nplaying longer latencies and smaller peaks in several movement parameters (e.g., velocity, deceleration), whereas \nno change was observed on the hand-related one (called grip component). Post tool use kinematics thus reveals \nthat participants’ arm (but not hand) representation was modified and suggests this change reflects a longer \narm representation. Arm represented length’s increase was indeed supported by comparing differences naturally \npresent among long(er)- and short(er)-armed participants: people with longer arm similarly displayed longer \nlatencies and smaller peaks in transport movement parameters. Convergent evidence from a touch localization \ntask showed that wrist-elbow delivered touches (but not wrist-fingertips) were localized farther apart after use \nof the same arm-elongating grabber\n5 (see also17). Altogether, these findings support the old tenet that humans \nincorporate tools in the action related body representation9,20. Y et, since all the previous studies were performed \nby assessing visually guided tool use actions, the role played by somatosensation per se in tool incorporation \nremains elusive.\nIn principle, both vision and somatosensation could contribute to tool incorporation, and recent work \nhas highlighted their integration\n21. While vision seems to be predominant for space and objects coding since \ninfancy22–24, proprioceptive and tactile signals appear to be critical information for the update of this implicit \naction-related body representation. Since its seminal conceptualization, the body schema has been thought as \nmainly fed by proprioceptive signals\n25. By varying the participants’ hand felt or seen orientation during a classical \nvisual hand laterality task 26, Shenton and colleagues determined that proprioception indeed plays a dominant \nrole for this implicit body representation27. In a recent single case study of a deafferented patient, we reported that \npreserved somatosensation is necessary for tool incorporation in the body representation for action to occur 28. \nImportantly, healthy participants are able to accurately estimate the length and barycenter of unseen rods if \nallowed to wield them\n29–31, suggesting that the brain can form a correct representation of a held object based on \nsomatosensory inputs alone.\nHowever, whether somatosensation alone is sufficient for tool-use-dependent body representation plasticity \nremains unknown. Here we addressed this question by comparing movement’s kinematics in blindfolded healthy \nparticipants when grasping an object before and after tool use. Crucially, vision was prevented throughout the \nexperiment, as participants had no visual information about the set-up, the tool they had to use, the object to be \ngrasped or even the room they were performing in.\nBased on the hypothesis that somatosensation is crucial for body schema plasticity\n9,32, we predicted to observe \nkinematic differences between pre and post blindfolded tool-use. We expected the transport component to be \nselectively affected, displaying a pattern similar to what found in previous studies where both vision and soma-\ntosensation were available in the same tool-use paradigm\n5,33,34, namely lower peak amplitude and longer peak \nlatencies in transport but not in grasping parameters. Repeatedly bringing the hand to a given position in space \nis known to increase precision of position sense\n35. To control for possible spatially selective effects of tool-use on \nsomatosensation, participants performed the free-hand grasping actions either in the same space (group 1) or in \nan orthogonally oriented space (group 2) with respect to the space and the direction in which they performed \nthe tool use movements. Further, to test whether tool-use changes are produced also at an explicit level of body \nrepresentation, we additionally used an explicit task of arm-length estimation\n10.\nExperiment 1\nMaterial and methods. Participants. We recruited forty-six participants without any known neurologic \nimpairment (21 males; mean age ± SD: 23.1 ± 4.1; range from 18.8 to 32.3) and randomly assigned them to two \ngroups of 23 participants (group 1: 11 males; mean age ± SD: 22.7 ± 1.2 years; range from 20.4 to 25.2, and group \n2: 10 males; mean age ± SD: 23.4 ± 3.3; range from 18.8 to 32.3; t(44) = −0.90; p > 0.250). All participants were \nright-handed and received a monetary compensation for their participation. They all gave written informed con-\nsent to participate to the study, which was approved by the ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes \nSud Est IV) and conformed to the principles of the revised Declaration of Helsinki36,37.\nApparatus and procedures. Participants were first blindfolded and then, with the help of the experimenter, \nentered the experimental room. They were comfortably seated in front of a table, the right hand in a pinch-shaped \ngrip (thumb and index fingertips touching) on a switch. Their left hand, flattened and palm down on the table, \nwas kept in contact with the target object, a wooden block (10 * 2.5 * 5 cm, 96 g) placed on the table. The object \nwas placed by the experimenter between the thumb and index fingertips, the corner of the wooden block con-\ntacting the skin of both the index and thumb (specifically, the lateral surface of the thumb and index fingertips). \nParticipants were instructed to keep their hand flat, palm down on the table and keep gentle contact with the \nobjet. Depending on which group the participant belonged to, the object was either lined up with participant’s \nright shoulder at 35 cm along the sagittal axis, or 35 cm along the frontal axis on the edge of the table (see Fig. 1a).\nThree sessions composed the experiment: a pre and post tool use session separated by a tool use session. The \npre and post tool use sessions were identical and consisted of two tasks proposed in a counterbalanced order \nacross participants (see Fig.  2): a free-hand grasping task (Implicit task; 18 trials), in which participants were \nrequired to reach, grasp and lift a target object with their right hand, and an arm length estimation task (Explicit \ntask; 12 trials), where participants had to slide their right index finger on the surface of the table from the start-\ning position to a final point for a distance they estimated to be equal to the distance between their wrist and \nelbow, which were named and touched by the experimenter while giving the tasks instructions to the participant. \nParticipants were touched only once, at the beginning of each length estimation task session (pre and post), on \nthe elbow and wrist of their right dominant arm, recalling them what was the anatomical distance to be estimated. \n3Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:5517  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41928-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nNotably, this task involves no pointing or implicit knowledge of the body posture such as in the forearm bisection \ntask6,38, typically used to investigate the body representation for action. It is a non-visual alternative metrics to \nmeasure the explicit knowledge of the arm length such as the line length task, where participants judge whether \na line is equally long as different parts of their hand\n39,40. In both tasks, performance measures were derived from \nIred markers displacement via an optoelectronic high-resolution motion tracking device (see below). In both \ntasks, once a trial performed, participants returned to the starting position (pinch grip position on the switch) \nand waited for an auditory ‘go’ signal to perform the next trial. The entire experiment was video-recorded. Actual \nforearm length was measured as the linear distance between the ulnar styloid process (at the wrist) and the \nhumeral medial epicondyle (at the elbow) at the end of the experiment.\nThe tool use session consisted of four blocks of 12 trials each (48 trials in total). We instructed participants to \nplace, at the beginning of each trial, the tip of the tool on the same starting switch used in the pre and post tool use \nphases and wait for the auditory go signal, upon which they had to use the tool to reach and grasp the same target \nobject used in the free-hand grasping task. The tool was a commercial grabber (Unger Enterprise Inc, CT, USA; \nsee Fig. 1b) with an ergonomic handle (9 cm) fitted with a lever, a 33-cm-long rigid shaft, and a “hand” with two \narticulated fingers (10 cm). Squeezing the lever (vertically) made the “fingers” of the tool closing (horizontally). \nFigure 1. Experimental set-up. (a) A wooden object was placed on the table either in front or to the left of the \nhand starting position. In both cases, the distance between the starting switch and the object was 35 cm.

(c) Tool use was always performed along a sagittal axis. \n(d) Left column: Before and after tool use, upon hearing a go signal, subjects had to reach and grasp the wooden \ntarget object with their hand: along the sagittal axis for Group 1, and along the frontal axis for Group 2. Right \ncolumn: The Estimation task consisted in sliding their index finger for a distance matching the one between \ntheir elbow and wrist, along a frontal axis for Group 1, along the sagittal axis for Group 2.\nFigure 2. Experiment 1 timeline. Tool use session included 4*12 trials. Pre and post tool use sessions consisted \nof 18 free hand grasping movements and 12 arm length estimation trials. The two tasks were run by blocks and \nthe order of the blocks was counterbalanced across participants.\n4Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:5517  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41928-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nParticipants were not allowed any previous practice with the tool and had never used it or seen it before the day of \ntesting, though they could haptically explore it with both hands before starting the experiment.\nThe pattern of changes in kinematics (lower peaks amplitudes and longer peaks latencies) expected here, has \npreviously been proven to be specific of tool use, as it is absent in control situations whereby the tool-use task \nwas replaced by an equal number of grasping movements performed both with the free hand (Baccarini et al.\n33; \nExperiment 2 of the present study) and with a weight -corresponding to that of the tool- attached to the hand 5, \nor even when the same tool was wielded but not used34. While this previous evidence did not urge us to include a \nnon-tool use condition in Experiment 1, it is important to consider that repetition of even relatively simple man-\nual reaching movements towards a given position has been reported to enhance proprioception selectively at that \nlocation. Wong and colleagues\n35 found that proprioceptive acuity improved in the trained region of workspace, \nwhereas no proprioceptive improvement was found when tested elsewhere. We deemed therefore relevant for \nthe present study to control for the possible confound that kinematics changes may occur because of changes in \nproprioception, instead of the hypothesized changes in the representation of the arm length. To run such a con-\ntrol, both groups performed the tool use session towards the same frontally located object (see Fig. 1c), but while \ngroup 1 performed the free hand grasping (before and after tool use) towards the same position, group 2 acted \nlaterally, toward an orthogonally oriented position (see Fig. 1a–d). As tool-use effects duration is not known, we \nopted for a between subject design to avoid carrying over effects on free hand movements. This design, by disso-\nciating movement direction between pre/post tool use tasks and the tool use session, allows to make alternative \npredictions. If tool use modifies proprioception in a spatially selective manner, then kinematics should be altered \nonly in the position where the tool was directed to (leading to an interaction group * Session: pre-post). Instead, \nif tool use modifies the represented arm length used to guide manual actions, then kinematics should be altered \nirrespective of position (leading to a main effect of Session).\nWe designed the control for the implicit nature of the effects similarly, distributing the explicit task orthogo-\nnally between the two groups. While all participants used the tool along the sagittal axis, participants in group 1 \nperformed the implicit task along the same axis and the explicit task on the frontal axis (toward the right side). \nParticipants in group 2 performed the implicit task along the frontal axis (toward their left) and the explicit task \nalong the sagittal axis (see Fig. 1d).\nKinematic recording system. We placed three infrared light emitting diodes (IREDs) on the participants’ right \nhand: on the medial lower corner of the thumb nail, on the lateral lower corner of the index finger nail and on the \nskin proximal to the styloid process of the radius at the wrist. Three more IREDs were located on the tool: on its \n“fingers” and on the distal part of the shaft (“wrist”). The reaching component of the movement was derived from \nthe wrist marker, and the grip component was derived from the thumb and index finger markers. Spatial local-\nization of the markers was recorded with an Optotrak 3020 (Northern Digital Inc, Ontario, Canada; sampling \nrate: 200 Hz; 3D resolution: 0.01 mm at 2.25 m distance). For each free-hand grasping movement, we extracted \nand analyzed off-line the following parameters: latencies and amplitudes of the wrist acceleration, velocity and \ndeceleration peaks (reaching component, Fig. 3), and latency and amplitude of the maximum thumb-index dis-\ntance (hereafter MGA for Maximum Grip Aperture) (grasping component). For each movement we measured \nthe overall movement time as the time between the beginning of the movement (velocity ≥ 10 mm/s after switch \nrelease) and stabilized grasp on the object (before object lifting). When participants accidently missed the object \nin free-hand reaches, we repeated the trial at the end of the session. For the arm length estimation task, we com-\nputed the distance between the starting switch and the end point of the index finger displacement using the IRED \nmarker on the index finger. Participants’ right forearm actual length (from the wrist to the elbow) was measured \nand compared to the estimated length. Participants’ right arm (from the wrist to the shoulder) and forearm \nactual length (from the wrist to the elbow respectively) were measured. Arm length was measured on a different \nday (due to some participants’ unavailability, arm length was measured for 30 participants out of 41; 15 for each \ngroup). Data on forearm length was missing for 3 participants out of 41.\nFigure 3. Kinematic profile of a representative subject (experiment 1; group 1) before (blue) and after tool use \n(green). After tool-use, the peaks were shorter and delayed. Black arrows indicate the positions of the extracted \nparameters, in amplitudes and latencies.\n5Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:5517  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41928-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nStatistical Analysis. Two participants who changed posture between the pre and post tool use sessions and three \nwho exceeded (> 2.5 standard deviation) population mean values in at least two kinematic parameters, were \nexcluded from analyses. Additionally, two participants of group 1 did not correctly understand the length estima-\ntion task instructions (they estimated the elbow-middle fingertip distance instead of the elbow-wrist distance); \ntheir data for this task have been discarded from analysis. Hence, analyses were conducted on data from 22 par-\nticipants from group 1 (11 males; mean age ± SD: 22.8 ± 1.2 years; range from 21.0 to 25.2) and 19 from group 2 \n(8 males; mean age ± SD: 23.6 ± 3.4 years; range from 18.8 to 32.3).\nWe performed a full factorial design permutation analysis\n41,42 on free-hand movement kinematic parameters \n(implicit task), using the flip package on R 43,44. As the arm length estimation (explicit) task involved only one \nparameter, a repeated measures ANOV A was performed on data from such task. Both the full factorial design \nand the ANOV A were with Group as a between-subject factor and Session (pre/post) as a within-subject factor \nto evaluate (1) the effect of tool use session on body representations and (2) the presence of these effects across \ndifferent movement directions. Although similar to an ANOV A, the interaction test in this permutation anal -\nysis differs in the calculation as it is the comparison of the differences between pre and post among the two \n(independent) groups. Importantly, the permutation analysis we applied in a previous study\n45 is designed for a \nmultivariate framework; it allows to combine the significance of the kinematic parameters for the reaching phase \n(amplitudes and latencies of peaks the wrist acceleration, velocity and deceleration) and those for the grasping \nphase (amplitudes and latencies of Maximum Grip Aperture), to obtain one global p-value for each component. \nThe global p-value is obtained via Nonparametric Combination (NPC\n46) of partial p-values testing the single \nparameters. The methodology accounts for dependence among tests through a nonparametric approach based on \nthe joint (i.e. multivariate) permutation distribution. For interpretation purposes, the global test is analogous to a \nMANOV A approach, but with less assumptions on the data and better inferential properties\n41,42.\nMoreover, for sake of comparison, kinematics without vision from group 1 was statistically compared to kine-\nmatics obtained under condition of full vision and somatosensation from Cardinali and collaborators5, as the two \nexperiments used the same paradigm, movement direction and tool. Sensory modality (somatosensation only in \nthis study: n = 22 vs. somatosensation and vision in Cardinali’s data: n = 14) was used as between-subject factor \nand Session (pre/post) as within subject factor.\nFollowing our prediction that tool use increases the represented arm length, and previous kinematic differ -\nences observed between short(er) and long(er)-armed participants\n34, we additionally ran correlation analyses \nbetween participants reaching parameters of the pre session (i.e. before tool use) and their actual arm length \n(both arm and forearm). The motivation for this approach is that if tool use effects consist in lengthening the \nrepresented length of the arm, naturally longer armed participants should show -naturally- different transport \nkinematics with respect to shorter armed participants. Using the flip package, we performed one-tail Pearson cor-\nrelations grouping the parameters from the reaching phase to obtain a global p value with Fisher combination. As \ndata on arm length was not available for all, we performed these correlations on the data from 30/41 participants \n(for the arm) and 38/41 (for the forearm).\nResults. Implicit task. The permutation analysis revealed significant Group effects on the wrist velocity peak \nafter Fisher combinations (group 1: 742 mm/s; group 2: 585 mm/s; K = 15.88, p < 0.001, η²p = 0.30). Group 2 par-\nticipants opened their fingers less than those of group 1 (group 1: 105 mm; group 2: 96 mm; K = 6.50, p = 0.028, \nη²p = 0.12). Noteworthy, this permutation analysis revealed no interaction between Group and Session in any of \nthe movement parameters (all p > 0.219), suggesting any effect of tool use was not limited to a given direction or \nportion of the workspace.\nIndeed, the analysis also revealed a main effect of Session on most of the transport parameters. Movements \nperformed after tool use were characterized by a reaching phase with longer peak latency for both velocity and \ndeceleration (velocity peak latency: 501 vs. 554 ms; t = 3.956, p < 0.001, η²p = 0.28; deceleration peak latency: \n695 vs. 755 ms; t = 3.216, p < 0.001, η²p = 0.21). In addition, all the peaks amplitudes were reduced after tool use \n(acceleration peak amplitude: 2852 vs 2603 mm/s²; t = −3.17, p = 0.002, η²p = 0.20; velocity peak amplitude: 684 \nvs 654 mm/s; t = −3.06, p = 0.004, η²p = 0.20; deceleration peak amplitude: − 2318 vs −2199 mm/s², t  = 2.04; \np = 0.047, η²p = 0.10). Figures 3 and 4 illustrate these tool-induced changes. No significant effects were found on \nthe movement time (t = 1.58; p = 0.121, η²p = 0.06), or on the grip component of the movement (MGA latency: \nt = 1.44; p = 0.159, η²p = 0.05; MGA peak: t = −1.74; p = 0.090, η²p = 0.07).\nA highly significant global p-value highlights that the kinematic changes were present for the transport com-\nponent (Fisher combination; K = 32.94, p < 0.001), as the grasping component was not significantly affected by \ntool use (K = 4.23, p = 0.080). There was no interaction between the two groups, neither for the reaching phase \nnor for the grasping phase (all ps > 0.389), reinforcing the similar behavior after tool-use whatever the movement \ndirection tested.\nFor the sake of precision, we also run the analysis on each group separately to verify if the significant dif -\nference was still present. On group 1, there was a significant effect of session on the amplitude of acceleration \n(t = −4.14; p < 0.001), latency of velocity (t = 4.26; p < 0.001), deceleration (t = 3.30; p = 0.003), and movement \ntime (t = 2.01; p = 0.049). The global p-value indicated that kinematic changes were present only on the trans-\nport component (Fisher combination; K = 27.63, p = 0.001), but not on the grasping one (Fisher combination; \nK = 2.52, p = 0.278). On group 2, there was a significant effect on the velocity amplitude (t = −2.74; p = 0.03), and \ntrends on the velocity latency (t  = 1.75; p = 0.091), velocity deceleration (t  = 1.79; p = 0.067) and deceleration \namplitude (t = 1.74; p = 0.098). The overall p value was close to significance for the transport component (Fisher \ncombination; K = 13.21, p = 0.058) but not for the grasping one (Fisher combination; K = 2.44, p = 0.281). Such \nresults confirmed the global analysis performed earlier, with specificity of the kinematics effect on the transport \ncomponent.\n6Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:5517  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41928-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nWhen comparing results from Group 1 of this study with those from Cardinali and collaborators5, we found \na main effect of Session for each parameter from the transport component (all ps < 0.021). Participants reached \nthe object with longer latencies and smaller amplitude after tool-use. We additionally observed a main effect of \nSensory modality, as blindfolded participants (i.e., somatosensation alone) were slower on all kinematic parame-\nter (all ps < 0.001) with respect to non-blindfolded participants (i.e., vision and somatosensation), except for the \nacceleration latency (Fisher combination; K = 4.54, p = 0.091). Permutation analyses also revealed a significant \ninteraction between the factor Sensory modality and Session for the whole transport component (Fisher com -\nbination; K = 25.58, p < 0.001). Performing tool-use with both vision and somatosensation further decreased \nthe amplitudes of the transport component parameters (acceleration: t = −3.253, p = 0.002; velocity: t = −4.057, \np < 0.001; and deceleration: t  = 4.633, p < 0.001). We found no interactions between Sensory modality and \nSession for any of the latencies (all ps > 0.428). When considering the grasping component, there was no main \neffect of Session, as tool-use did not affect either the latency, or the amplitude of MGA (all ps > 0.109), thus \nreinforcing the selectivity of kinematic changes for the transport component of movements. A main effect of \nSensory modality indicated a larger and delayed MGA while grasping without vision (all ps < 0.001). We found \nno interaction between Sensory modality and Session for the grasping component (Fisher combination; K = 3.25, \np = 0.168).\nExplicit task. When comparing the arm length estimation before and after tool use, we found neither main \neffects, nor interaction, indicating that tool use did not affect the explicit representation of arm length. The \nestimated length was similar before and after tool use (pre: 255 mm; post: 251 mm; F(1, 37) = 0.86, p = 0.360). \nParticipants forearm estimation corresponded to 94% and 92% of their actual forearm length before and after \ntool use, respectively.\nActual arm length correlations. Finally, we examined the correlation between participants’ arm length (rang-\ning from 495 to 650 mm) or forearm length (ranging from 245 to 305 mm) and the 6 kinematic parameters of \nthe transport component as measured before tool use. Significant correlation (see Fig. 5) indicated that partici-\npants having longer arms exhibited longer latencies than participants with shorter arms (velocity: r (28) = 0.42, \np = 0.010; deceleration: r(28) = 0.42, p = 0.010; a similar but non-significant trend was observed for the accelera-\ntion peak latency r(28) = 0.29, p = 0.059). Regarding peaks amplitude, longer armed participants showed reduced \nacceleration (r(28) = −0.32, p = 0.041) and, marginally, deceleration (r(28) = 0.30, p = 0.054). A non-significant \ntrend was visible for velocity (r(28) = −0.28, p = 0.069). The Fisher combination from the permutation approach \nindicated that the overall transport component was significantly correlated to participants’ arm length (K = 20.8, \nFigure 4. Tool use modifies movement kinematics of the reaching component. After tool use (green), \nparticipants (group average) showed longer latencies (upper graphs) and smaller peak amplitudes (lower \ngraphs) compared to before tool use (blue).

As for the forearm, the same pat-\ntern was observed with reduced acceleration (r(36) = −0.33, p = 0.014) and deceleration (r(36) = 0.37, p = 0.012) \namplitudes for participants with longer forearms. A similar non-significant trend was observed for the amplitude \nof the velocity (r(36) = −0.25, p = 0.063). Once again, the Fisher combination indicated that the overall transport \ncomponent was significantly correlated to participants’ forearm length (K = 16.8, p = 0.041)\nInterim discussion. The results of Experiment 1 clearly favor the hypothesis that somatosensation is suffi-\ncient for the plastic changes of arm length representation to emerge. Control condition (between groups) and task \n(within groups) further show the effects are not limited to a given (trained) sector of space and emerge selectively \nat an implicit level (reaching kinematics), without affecting the explicit, subjective estimate of one’s own arm \nlength.\nBesides observing the predicted pattern of results on kinematics, discussed in detail below (Discussion sec-\ntion), the post tool use session also revealed a previously unreported phenomenon: 13 participants (out of 22) \nfrom group 1, and 4 participants (out of 19) from group 2 failed to grasp the object in the very first few trials (trial \n1 to max 4, out of 18) because they would not reach far enough to come in contact with the object. In addition, \nsome participants (group 1: 5/22 participants; group 2: 3/19 participants) sometimes missed the starting point \non their way back to it at the end of the trial. Backward reaching movements were too long, bringing the hand \nbetween the starting point and the chest.\nThis misreaching behavior might be due to the arm-retracted posture during the tool-use session, which may \nhave affected their felt starting position. To maintain the same distance between the effector (hand or tool) and \nthe object throughout the experiment, participants were instructed to place the tip of the tool prongs on the same \nstarting switch where they positioned their index and thumb fingertips during free-hand grasping. To do so, they \nhad to move the scapula posteriorly and medially along the back (scapula retraction) resulting in a different arm \nposture. Changing the starting position is known to affect movements modifying the arm end posture\n47, inducing \ndirectional biases48, or altering kinematics49. These studies, however, focused on visually guided movements and \ndid not investigate the effects potentially emerging when postural changes are only driven by proprioception. \nNoteworthy, Vindras and colleagues\n50 observed that initial hand position influences pointing errors when only \nproprioception is available, these effects disappearing when hand vision is also allowed. We thus reasoned that \npostural changes between free-hand and tool-mediated reaching (scapula retraction) may be responsible for dys-\nmetric reaching, independently of the tool-induced kinematic changes reported above.\nTo test this hypothesis, we performed a second experiment using the same pre/post paradigm as in \nExperiment 1. Importantly, in Experiment 2 participants did not use a tool, but performed an equivalent number \nof free-hand movements adopting an initial arm position that mimicked the one adopted during tool use session \nof Experiment 1 (Scapular retraction; see Fig.  6). Before and after these retracted posture sessions, participants \nhad to perform free-hand grasping movements as in Experiment 1, thus Experiment 2 also provided a further \ncontrol for the specificity of the tool-use effects obtained in Experiment 1. We hypothesized that (1) modifying \nthe initial position of the hand would be sufficient to induce dysmetric reaching in the post session, and (2) in the \nabsence of tool use, we should no longer observe the kinematics changes that followed tool-use in Experiment 1.\nFigure 5. Correlation between kinematic parameters (peak latencies and amplitudes) and participants’ arm \nlength. The graphs show the time at which each subject reached a particular peak (upper panels) and the \namplitude of the peak (bottom panels) from the pre tool use session, plotted against the participants’ arm length. \nEach dot represents a subject (N = 30). Significant correlations are indicated in bold. The longer the participants’ \narms, the longer their latencies and the lower the peaks amplitude.\n8Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:5517  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41928-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nExperiment 2\nMaterial and methods.  Participants. We recruited twenty participants without any known neurologic \nimpairment (10 males; mean age ± SD: 22.3 ± 2.4; range from 18 to 26.6). None of them took part in the first \nexperiment. All participants were right-handed and received a monetary compensation for their participation. \nThey all gave written informed consent to participate to the study, which was approved by ethics committee \n(Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud Est IV) and conformed to the Helsinki declaration.\nApparatus and procedures. Apparatus and procedure were the same as for Experiment 1 except that Experiment \n2 was a within-subject design, composed of 5 sessions (see Fig.  7): one before and two after two retracted \nposture sessions in which we modified the arm starting posture. The pre and post retracted posture sessions \nconsisted of the same free-hand grasping task (18 trials) as those performed by Group 1 in Experiment 1, the \nobject being located at 35 cm along the sagittal axis. The two retracted posture sessions (“Long-Distance” and \n“Short-Distance”), interleaved across the 18 participants, were composed of four blocks of 12 trials each (48 \ntrials in total), during which participants, upon hearing an auditory go signal, were required to perform a reach \nand grasp movement without any tool (free-hand). During these retracted posture sessions, their initial hand \nposition mimicked the one adopted in Experiment 1 for the tool use session (compare Figs 1c and 6b). The new \nstarting position was set for each subject so that it would be equivalent to the one adopted if he/she had to use \nthe tool. The micro-switch was repositioned underneath the participants’ hand (approximately 50 cm behind the \nstarting point used in the pre and post sessions). In the “Long-distance” session, the object was in the same place \nas in Experiment 1, therefore at about 85 cm from the newly defined starting position. On the “Short-distance” \nsession, the object was moved closer to the new starting position to maintain the same object distance as in \nthe Experiment 1 and pre and post retracted posture sessions of Experiment 2 (see Fig.  6). The order of the \n“Short-Distance” and “Long-Distance” sessions was counterbalanced across participants. Each retracted posture \nsession was followed by a post session in which participants went back to the same starting position adopted in \nthe pre-retracted posture session. The entire experiment was video-recorded.\nKinematic recording and analysis. Kinematic recordings and analyses were as in Experiment 1. We excluded two \nparticipants from analyses: one because he systematically touched his left hand before grasping the object with his \nright hand, and one because he presented mean values exceeding 2.5 standard deviation of the mean population \nFigure 6. Experimental set-up for Experiment 2. (a) A wooden object was placed on the table in front of the \nstarting position, at 35 cm. Before and after the two sessions with retracted starting posture, inducing either a \nlong- (b) or short-distance (c) grasping movement, participants reached out and grasped the wooden target \nobject with their right hand upon hearing a go signal. (b) In the Long-Distance session the initial posture was \nthe same as the one assumed while using a 40cm-long grabber in Experiment 1, with the object to grasp at the \nsame position than in the pre and post tool use sessions (e.g. about 85 cm from this new starting point). (c) In \nthe “Short-Distance” session participants maintained the same initial posture as in the Long-Distance session \nwhile the target object was positioned 35 cm from the acting hand.\nFigure 7. Experiment 2 timeline. Each participant performed two retracted arm posture sessions (Short-\nDistance and Long-Distance Grasping) preceded and followed by a block of free-hand grasping movements. \nThe order of the two sessions was counterbalanced across participants.\n9Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:5517  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41928-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nfor at least two parameters. The data from the remaining 18 participants who took part in this within design (10 \nmales; mean age ± SD: 22.2 ± 2.5; range from 18 to 26.6) were submitted to a full factorial design permutation \nanalysis on pre and post session kinematic parameters with Order (“Short-distance reach” or “Long-distance \nreach” first) as a between-subject factor and Session (pre/post short-distance reach/post long-distance reach) as a \nwithin-subject factor to investigate (1) if the order of the retracted posture sessions had an influence on the kine-\nmatics, and (2) if the starting posture had an influence on the kinematics of free-hand movements. In addition to \nkinematics analysis, we reported the number of misreaches.\nAll data analyzed during this study are included in this published article (and its Supplementary Information \nfiles).\nResults. Dysmetric reaching. Following the repeated execution of reach to grasp movements performed with \neither scapular retraction posture, 5 out of 18 participants undershot the object in one or two trials at the begin-\nning of the post session (4 participants after the long reach condition and 1 after the short reach one). Misreaching \nmovements when going back to the starting-point were also observed, affecting 10 out of 18 participants (10 after \nthe short-distance reach condition, and 4 after the long-distance reach one). By replicating the newly reported \nfinding that people misreach objects when a retracted arm position is imposed during proprioceptively guided \nactions, we provide support to the hypothesis that misreaching can occur independently of tool use.\nMovement kinematics. Changing the hand starting posture affected some of the kinematic parameters of sub-\nsequent movements: noticeably, retracted arm posture increased the peak amplitudes (differently from tool-use, \nwhich decreased the same parameters). Permutations analyses revealed no main effect of Order (all ps > 0.153) \nneither interaction between Order and Session (all p  > 0.13). Session had a significant effect on the wrist \nvelocity peak (Fisher combination K  = 9.71, p = 0.011, η²\np = 0.27), the deceleration peak (K  = 8.17, p = 0.029, \nη²p = 0.23), and the movement time (K = 7.69, p = 0.039, η²p = 0.19) (see Fig. 8). Wrist velocity increased after the \nretracted arm posture in the “Short-distance reach” condition (pre: 760 vs post: 819 mm/s, t = 2.99, p = 0.007), \na non-significant trend being visible for the “Long-distance reach” condition (pre: 760 vs post: 801 mm/s, \nt = 2.01, p = 0.054). A significant increase between pre and post sessions was observed for the deceleration peak \n(“Short-distance reach”: pre: − 2485 vs post: − 2833 mm/s², t = −2.52, p = 0.020; “Long-distance reach”: pre: \n−2485 vs post: −2756 mm/s², t = −2.08, p = 0.041), the two post sessions not differing from each other (t = 0.844, \np = 0.416). As for the movement time, a significant decrease was observed only after the “Short-distance reach” \n(pre: 1318 vs post: 1219 ms, t = −2.34, p = 0.031; “long-distance reach”: pre: 1318 vs post: 1261 ms, t = −1.37, \np = 0.184). When considering the latencies, retracted posture conditions had no significant effect on any of the \nparameters (acceleration: K  = 2.14, p = 0.589; velocity: K = 0.931, p = 0.873; deceleration: K = 2.40, p = 0.523). \nFinally, the grip component of the movement was not affected by the retracted posture conditions (latency: \nK = 3.26, p = 0.351, aperture: K = 2.66, p = 0.467).\nWhen grouping the parameters according to the movement component they describe, posture-dependent \nmodifications did not reach significance for either the reaching (Fisher combination; K = 23.85, p = 0.080), or the \ngrasping component (Fisher combination; K = 4.07, p = 0.395). Overall, and taking a very conservative stance, the \nresults of Experiment 2 indicate that while misreaching behavior can be observed independent of tool-use, chang-\ning starting posture effects on kinematic are absent or, if anything, opposite to those observed following tool-use.\nDiscussion\nCan we incorporate a tool based on somatosensation alone? To answer this question, here we assessed whether \nhealthy participants - relying solely on somatosensory inputs - could display the pattern of kinematic changes \nproposed to be the hallmark of tool incorporation in the unconscious body representation for action (see, for \nreview\n9). Blindfolded healthy adults used a tool to grasp an object on a table. They were not provided with any \nvisual information about either task specific features (e.g. object location, shape and size), or contextual features \nFigure 8. Movement kinematics following changes in arm posture. After both short- (light green) and long-\ndistance sessions (dark green), participants showed higher peaks compared to before (blue). These changes \nare in the opposite direction to the ones induced by tool use in Experiment 1. Latencies (not shown) were not \nsignificantly modified. Asterisks denote significant differences between pre and post sessions. *<0.05; **<0.01; \nBars illustrate mean values for each parameter and the 95% confidence interval.\n10Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:5517  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41928-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n(e.g. working space or even the testing room). We only allowed participants to haptically explore both the object \nand the tool prior to the testing. Participants showed altered kinematics of reach-to-grasp movements after a brief \nperiod of proprioceptively-guided tool use. Movements performed after tool use exhibited significant changes in \nmost of the transport component parameters, while grip parameters were not significantly affected. Such speci-\nficity of the kinematic modifications has been reported previously\n32,45 and have been interpreted as resulting from \nthe absence of functional change in the grasping component. Indeed, actuating the tool in different planes (verti-\ncal vs horizontal squeezing), or even opposite direction (squeezing to open vs to close tool prongs) has not been \nconsidered critical for the achievement of the ultimate ‘function’ of the hand effector. For example, the kinematics \nof grasping is controlled independently of some of the biomechanical features of the grasping effector: by using a \nsimilar grabber to the one employed here (i.e., not enlarging the hand), Gentilucci and colleagues found striking \nkinematics similarities when comparing grasping an object with the tool and with the hand. Namely, the scaling \nof both peak velocity of aperture of the mechanical fingers and their maximal aperture varied as a function of \nobject size just as did those of the biological fingers\n51. In tool-use trained monkeys, cortical motor neurons coding \nfor hand grasping also fire while grasping with pliers (not enlarging the monkey hand), and this was true irre-\nspective of whether normal pliers or reverse pliers (squeeze to open) were used to grasp an object\n52. However, one \nshould observe kinematics changes at the level of the hand (grasping component) if some functional features of \nthis effector are modified by a tool. Accordingly, we previously reported that the use of pliers or sticks - mimicking \na functional elongation of the fingers – did induce modifications on the subsequent kinematic profile of the grasp-\ning component. Interestingly, in those conditions (i.e., using a tool that elongates the fingers but not the arm) \nthe reaching component was not affected\n45. Similarly, in a tactile distance judgment task, Miller and colleagues \nreported that plastic modulation was observed on the hand after the use of a hand-shaped tool (making the hand \nfunctionally bigger), but not with an arm-shaped grabber (making the arm functionally longer). Conversely, \nmodification of the arm representation was only observed after the use of the arm-shaped grabber, but not the \nhand-shaped one\n19. These studies have thus shown that body representation changes after tool-use are specific to \nthe morpho-functional characteristics and the sensori-motor constrains imposed by the tool9,19,45. Importantly, \nthese changes in kinematics were not spatially selective for the region where they used the tool (see35), thus ruling \nout the possibility that they represent a mere consequence of proprioceptive enhancement.\nWhen considering the whole dataset of the current study (somatosensation only available, group 1&2), our \nconservative permutation-based approach made clear that somatosensation is sufficient for tool-use to modify \nboth latencies and amplitude peaks of the transport phase. This pattern of kinematic changes is similar to that \nreported when participants used the same tool under visual guidance\n5,34. When statistically comparing part of \nthe current data (somatosensation only available in group 1) with those from Cardinali and coworkers5 (soma-\ntosensation and vision available), it appeared that the multisensory condition may further enhance tool-induced \neffects on the peaks amplitude of the transport parameters. Moreover, Cardinali and colleagues 34 reported that \nlonger-armed participants tended to move with longer latencies and smaller peaks as compared to short-armed \ngroup. Here, correlation analyses confirmed the intimate relationship between arm length and transport kine-\nmatics: the longer the arm, the longer the latencies and the smaller the peaks amplitudes. This finding provides \nfurther support to the conclusion the pattern of kinematics changes observed here reflects the information that \nthe arm to be moved is (represented as) longer after tool use.\nIn sharp contrast with the implicit arm representation for action, explicit arm representation seems immune \nto tool-use when only somatosensation is available. When participants were asked to explicitly estimate their arm \nlength, we observed no effect of tool use, irrespective of whether the task was performed in the same or different \ndirection/region of space with respect to where they used the tool. While tool use under visual guidance might \nlead to incorporation\n53, the present findings suggest that, although sufficient for implicit tool incorporation in \nthe body representation for action, proprioception might not be sufficient to trigger tool incorporation at a more \nexplicit level (see also\n11,54). While this finding could provide preliminary evidence that more explicit and con-\nscious body representations, such as the Body Image, may be more resistant to some forms of tool use effects, fur-\nther investigations using a wider range of Body Image tasks (see55,56) are needed to better delineate the conditions \nof permeability of the explicit body representation to tool incorporation.\nThis study critically extends our knowledge on the sensory information triggering tool embodiment and \nfurther confirms the specific kinematics fingerprints following tool-use. Here somatosensory tool-use revealed \ntwo major consequences: one is essentially kinesthetic and derives from tool-use per se (Exp. 1); a second one, \nstatesthetic, derives from the modification in arm posture when wielding the tool at the starting position (i.e., \nscapular retraction, Exp. 2, see Fig. 6). While the former is reflected in the kinematics changes recalled above, the \nlatter, newly observed here, took the form of dysmetric reaching movements (see supplementary for an example \nvideo). In a few trials right after tool-use, some participants misreached either the target object, or the home-pad \non their way back to the starting point. Since changes in hand starting position are known to affect movements \ntrajectories when no vision of the hand is allowed\n47,50, we took care of controlling also for this potential confound \nin experiment 2, by studying grasping movements performed -without tool- before and after a session in which \nhand posture was made to mimic the retracted one that participants experienced during tool use. As expected \nfrom changing arm posture, experiment 2 revealed the same kind of misreaching errors, that is misses of the \nobject and/or the starting position. While this type of misreaching errors were observed after tool use in experi-\nment 1, the control experiment 2 also makes clear that they cannot be attributed to the incorporation of the tool, \nas they were also present when the mere arm posture was modified without the tool. Experiment 2 also served the \npurpose of controlling for spurious test-retest effects of movement repetition and fatigue. At odds with the results \nobtained after tool use, this control experiment showed no significant change in kinematics of either the trans-\nport or the grasping component. If anything, participants tended to exhibit higher peaks in the transport kine-\nmatic parameters, instead of the lower peaks reported, here and elsewhere, following tool use\n5. Altogether, these \n11Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:5517  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41928-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nfindings clarify that separable effects can be observed and specifically attributed to either tool-incorporation, or \nchanges in perceived hand posture.\nSomatosensory signals evoked by tool use per se are thus sufficient for incorporating a tool that has never been \nseen, nor used, before. These findings complement a longitudinal study on a deafferented patient where no tool \nincorporation was observed due to the lack of proprioception\n28. By showing that a temporary absence of vision \ndoes not prevent tool incorporation in healthy participants, here we provide the lacking piece of evidence sup-\nporting the hypothesis that somatosensation is not only necessary\n28, but is also sufficient for tool incorporation. \nAn interesting issue concerns the duration of the tool induced changes on body representation. By experimental \ndesign, we observed that it lasted during the whole duration of the post-session block, which is about 20  min \ndepending on the order of the tasks. As we and others have proposed, this may be a transient effect and it would \nmake adaptive sense if, similar to an elastic band, the arm representation would subsequently go back to its orig-\ninal size\n57,58 (for review9). As indeed pointed out by Longo and colleagues, plasticity might occur over multiple \ntimescales dependent on usage frequency59. Indeed, long-lasting plasticity induced by tools, has been observed in \nthe peripersonal space of blind people using their cane daily to navigate60, suggesting that some massive exercise \nmight lead to longer lasting changes. This issue definitely deserves further investigation.\nThese findings also nicely parallel the previous observation that tool modifies peripersonal space even in \nthe absence of vision60 as shown by blindfolded adults whose peripersonal space was limited to their hand, but \nwas extended to include the tool after a few minutes of practice. Here we extend this knowledge, indicating that \ntool-use in blindfolded participants not only affects the space representation, but also the body representation \nfor action. While somatosensation is sufficient, when available, vision certainly plays an important role in tool \nembodiment. Indeed, in a recent study, Miller and collaborators\n17 leveraged a visual illusion to investigate tool use \neffects. Participants saw the mirror reflection of their right arm grasping with a tool, thus illusorily experiencing \ntool-use in their left arm. After this tool-use illusion, tactile perception was modified in the stationary, unseen left \narm. A control experiment additionally showed a quantitatively similar tactile effects could be obtained following \nactual tool use with the left arm. Vision thus can play an important role in determining tool-use effects. In the \nsame vein, here we additionally provide a comparison with previous work that used the same paradigm under \ncondition where both somatosensation and vision were available and found that vision may also enhance tool \nincorporation: while the full pattern of kinematic changes was present in either combination of sensory modali-\nties, tool-use under vision and somatosensation reduced kinematics peaks amplitude even more than blindfolded \ntool-use (i.e., somatosensation alone). In this respect, we recently observed that tool-use imagery was sufficient \nto induce tool incorporation\n33. In this case, possibly according to the individual imagery style (visual and/or \nkinaesthesic), both proprioceptive and visual imagery of tool-use might have contributed to tool incorporation. \nThis is also in line with studies on paralyzed patients, where mere tool-use observation was sufficient to induce \nplasticity on body representation\n38. While our findings demonstrate that a temporary loss of vision in not suffi-\ncient to prevent tool incorporation in the body representation for action, a thorough assessment of the role played \nby vision awaits for future investigations of people suffering from permanent visual loss. Serino and collaborators’ \nstudy\n60 cited above indeed illustrated that blind people displayed more permanent changes than blindfolded \nsighted participants in their peripersonal space representation. Quite interestingly, it seems that congenitally \nblind participants can remap objects in their peripersonal space, or in others’ peripersonal space as well as sighted \nparticipants\n61, reinforcing the need for further investigations.\nThe present study additionally examined, for the first time, the kinematics of movements performed in a \ndirection different from that acted upon during tool use, and found that tool-induced kinematic changes did \nnot interact with the specific direction/region of space in which the tool has been used. While some generaliza-\ntion effects of tool use have been previously reported (from reaching to pointing movements, see\n5), the present \nfindings suggest that kinematics modifications may be arm-anchored, strongly supporting the idea that tool use \naffects the represented body morphology.\nWhen discussing tool incorporation in the framework of motor control, it is important to assess the possible \nrelationships between the effects we observed after tool-use and some of the most typical ‘aftereffects’ following \nsensorimotor learning (see for review\n62). For example, aftereffects following learning to walk with a weight (and \nthus higher torque) applied to a foot, would manifest as opposite to the effect induced by the weight itself, which \nlowers the maximum toe trajectory height. Comparing post-weight with pre-weight brings the toes being moved \nalong a higher trajectory after release from weight\n63. In sharp contrast, the results reported here (and elsewhere) \nafter grabber-use do not display shorter latencies and larger peaks than before tool-use, as one should expect \nfrom an ‘aftereffect’ perspective. Indeed, grasping objects with the same tool employed here has been shown to \nlengthen the latencies and reducing the peaks of the tool-transport component\n5,34. Contrasting with the direction \nof the effect which would be typically expected from most sensorimotor learning tasks (that is, shorter laten-\ncies and larger peaks), the direction of the effects reported here and in previous similar tool-use studies display \nthe opposite pattern (that is, longer latencies and smaller peaks). Relatedly, transporting with the hand a heavy \nweight, participants likely applying a more important force to displace heavy (as compared to lighter) objects, was \nfound to lengthen the latencies and reducing the amplitudes of transport parameters\n64. These kinematics changes \nare similar to those we observed during tool-use5,34. Importantly however, removing or reducing the weight typ-\nically induces higher amplitudes and shorter latencies with respect to the control (pre) condition, as there is no \nlonger weight inertia to be exceeded by the applied force 65,66. These results corroborate the ones by Lam and \ncolleagues63 and contrast with the direction of the kinematics effects we have observed after tool-use both here, \nand in previous work. Thus, the known effects produced by release from weight and torque are not compatible \nwith the lengthening of the latencies and the decrease of the amplitudes we consistently reported after tool-use. \nWe therefore consider tool-use effects of the kind reported here differ from motor learning induced aftereffects \nand may help disambiguating between changes occurring at the level of the environment (aftereffects following \nmotor learning of modified external conditions) from those occurring at the level of the state estimation of the \n12Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:5517  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41928-1\nwww.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nbody (modification of arm length representation following tool use). In this respect, it is important to consider \ntool use effects in the framework of internal models of action control (see45,67). To execute a movement, one has \nto anticipate and plan her action, as optimally as possible, through the inverse model of action, which is updated \nbased on sensory signals. To avoid costly delays, sensory consequences of actions are predicted in the forward \nmodel, allowing for a better action tuning. As suggested elsewhere\n45,67, the body schema can be operationalized \ninto a specific state estimate of the body, akin to hand position, or posture 68. In agreement with recent work by \nTang and collaborators69, the body schema would not contain the same motor program to be applied to either \nthe arm or the tool, but would allow for the inverse model to be informed about a change in the state of the body. \nIn other words, reaching with a tool would imply updating the state of the arm, i.e. the length parameter in the \nappropriate internal model. State estimation is a bridge between measured consequences of actions and update \nof inverse models, as well as between merely predicted consequences from forward model and update of inverse \nmodel\n70. Body representation plasticity leading to tool incorporation could thus originate from both measured \nand predicted feedbacks, according to the current availability of sensory information and the task’s specific con-\nstraints. Measured and predicted actions consequences may thus lead to tool-dependent kinematic changes that \nhave been reported to follow, respectively, actual movements\n5,17,19,45 and imagined movements33. Richer sensory \ninformation leading to better-tuned models, the combination of vision and proprioception would logically lead \nto better tool incorporation as compared to proprioception or imagery alone.\nIn conclusion, here we report that somatosensory inputs (proprioceptive and haptic information) alone are \nsufficient for tool incorporation in healthy participants, suggesting an important role of somatosensation in the \nmaintenance of the body representation for action.\nReferences\n 1.
