    "abstract": "The purpose of the study is to provide an overview of the methods and cases of using AI agents in the project management sphere. In the context of the rapid growth in the number of teams and individual specialists using digital technologies, as well as in the context of an increase in the number of stakeholders and business processes acceleration, traditional approaches to project management are losing their effectiveness and require rethinking. The architecture, operation principles, and AI agents’ autonomy levels have been considered, and a comprehensive analysis of existing practices for their implementation in project activities has been carried out using the example of popular digital platforms. Special attention has been paid to the authors’ personal experience in developing and applying an AI agent in a planning system, including the difficulties identified in interpreting user requests, integrating with external services, and maintaining user trust. The influence of raw and unstructured data on automated solutions effectiveness has been emphasized, and ways to minimize such risks have been proposed. The final part contains recommendations on architecture and strategy for integrating AI into project processes, considering the specifics of tasks, the needs of teams, and the degree of criticality of decisions made.",
