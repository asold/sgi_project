These are deep learning models, trained on massive\nvolumes of text data using an unsupervised learning artiﬁcial\nintelligence (AI) algorithm to predict and generate text based\non user input\n1 (►Fig. 1).\nChatGPT4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) (OpenAI,\nSan Francisco, California, United States) is a transformer-based\nLLM model pretrained on public data as well as data obtained\nfrom third-party sources using deep learning techniques of\nﬁne tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback\nto predict the next text.\n2,3 Strengths of the model lie on\nanalyzing, predicting, and generating text (known as natural\nlanguage processing) in a conversational manner based on user\ninput.\n4,5 This makes it suitable for wide variety of time-\nconsuming text-based outputs like (but not limited to) gener-\nating lesson plans, designing curricula, creating assessment\nmaterials, summarizing textbooks or articles, and providing\npersonalized learning content. This process of“automated\ncontent synthesis” (ACS) allows users to focus on core compe-\ntencies and drive innovations. Studies havebeen done on use of\nLLM in health care delivery and medical education.\n6 The study\nobjective was to evaluate the role of LLMs like ChatGPT as a\nteaching assistant (TA) to plastic surgery residents. A TA is\nsomeone who assists teachers by providing teaching and\nlearning support in whatever way possible. A traditional TA\nhas two main roles to play, support the students in their\nlearning process and support the instructors in the effective\ndelivery of the course content.\n7\nMaterial and Methods\nThe roles of a TA wereﬁrst identiﬁed in available literature,\nand based on the roles, a list of suitable tasks was created\nwhere LLM could be used to perform the task. Prompts\ndesigned to be fed in to the LLM (speciﬁcally ChatGPT) to\ngenerate appropriate output, were then created. Each\nprompt was created to request a speciﬁcT At a s kf r o mt h e\nLLM. The prompts were fed to ChatGPT and outputs generat-\ned were analyzed for content accuracy and usefulness. The\noutputs were evaluated by a two set of evaluators. Theﬁrst\nset composed of the evaluators who were aware of the use of\nLLM to generate the outputs and the second set of evaluators\nblinded from the source of content. The scores of all observ-\ners were compared for interobserver variability and agree-\nment using kappa statistics.\n8\nResults\nAs aﬁrst step of this project a set of TA roles were identiﬁed\nand from among these, roles suitable for LLM were short-\nlisted7 (►Table 1). The authors could identify only three tasks\nsuitable for LLM, that is, assisting faculty with classroom\ninstruction, records, and assignments, grading assignments\nor papers, and providing feedback on assignments. As can be\nseen, all the identiﬁed roles were oriented toward support-\ning the course instructor and none were directed toward\nassisting the residents.\nTo identify if there were any roles a LLM model could play\nin supporting residents as well as any other teaching-related\ntasks in plastic surgery, a prompt was fed into the ChatGPT\ndialog box“suggest use case scenarios for LLM in teaching of\nPlastic Surgery.” The roles listed in the response were then\nanalyzed by the authors to see whether it was relevant to the\nobjective in question, appropriate for using a LLM model, and\nfeasible by the LLM model (\n►Table 2). Relevance and appro-\npriateness of a particular AI-generated task was resolved by\ndiscussion among authors and by checking LLM responses in\ncertain cases. Items which were either irrelevant or inappro-\npriate were excluded from the ﬁnal list of tasks to be\nevaluated for feasibility. Of the 10 roles identiﬁed by LLM,\nrole related to research, like research assistance, was exclud-\ned as our aim was to identify use case scenarios for academic\ncould identify a few such scenarios where the LLM could in general be utilized to play\nthe role of a TA and aid plastic surgery residents in particular. In addition, these models\nc o u l da l s ob eu s e db ys t u d e n t st oo b t a i nf e e d b a c ka n dg a i nr eﬂection which itself\nstimulates critical thinking.\nConclusion Incorporating LLMs into the educational arsenal of plastic surgery\nresidency programs can provide a dynamic, interactive, and individualized learning\nexperience for residents and prove to be worthy TAs of future.\nFig. 1 Schematic representation of a large language model.\nIndian Journal of Plastic Surgery Vol. 56 No. 5/2023 © 2023.

Similarly, a role“collaborative learning plat-\nform” which referred to the integration of LLM into the\nlearning management systems was also excluded as it did\nnot appear feasible at the moment. A suitably designed\nprompt relevant to the role to the LLM model was submitted\nto the model, so as to generate an output. The output was\nscored for accuracy, usefulness, and clarity by two sets of\nevaluators on a Likert scale. Theﬁrst set consisted ofﬁve\nevaluators who were aware of LLM as the source of the\ncontent. The second set consisted of three evaluators who\nwere blinded to the source of the content.\nRoles Identiﬁed for LLM\nA ﬁnal set of eight TA roles were identiﬁed, where a LLM\ncould be utilized to generate content.

These were\nscored independently by the eight evaluators in a scoring\nsheet created for the study. The study authors were the\nevaluators divided into two sets. Initially,ﬁve authors in-\ncluding the corresponding author designed the prompts and\nanalyzed the responses of the LLM model. Subsequently, the\nremaining three authors were independently enlisted to\nreview these same responses. At this stage, they were not\nmade aware of the responses’ origin to ensure unbiased\nevaluation. Once their evaluations were complete, these\nauthors were incorporated as contributors to the study,\nproviding valuable insights for the discussion section. All\nauthors are teaching faculty in medical colleges with a\nminimum of 4 years’experience in teaching plastic surgery.\nIn addition, all authors are active participants in the medical\neducation unit of their respective institutions.\nVirtual tutor: This refers to the use of LLM to generate\nexplanation of critical concepts in plastic surgery to aid the\nresident in improving their understanding of the subject. For\nthe study, the LLM generated an explanation of mechanism\nof claw hand deformity in ulnar nerve palsy.\nPrompt used:“I am not able to understand why claw hand\nhappens in an ulnar nerve injury. Can you explain me in an\neasy way the mechanism of claw hand deformity?”\nPercent overall agreement¼68.57%.\nWhile most of the evaluators agreed with the perceived\nusefulness of the role, there was disagreement among\nauthors regarding the accuracy of the content generated.\nThere was agreement among authors on the clarity, compre-\nhensiveness, and length of the passage generated.\nInteractive case studies (generation): The LLM was utilized\nto generate hypothetical patient cases with varying levels of\ncomplexity for students to analyze, diagnose, and plan\ntreatment, targeted toward residents in the 1st, 2nd, and\n3rd year of their training.\nPrompts used: “generate hypothetical patient cases with\nvarying levels of complexity for students to analyze, diagnose,\nand plan treatment in Plastic surgery.”\nHere, different short clinical scenarios were generated\nalong with a treatment plan.\nPercent overall agreement¼43.33%.\nPrompts used:“generate a case scenario for a beginner on\nmandible fracture in a 20 year old male. Give one subjective\nquestion based on this scenario and two multiple-choice\nquestions (MCQs) based on the same scenario.”\n“generate a case scenario for an advanced trainee on\nmandible fracture in a 20 year old male. Do Not display the\ntreatment plan. Give one subjective question based on this\nscenario and two MCQs based on the same scenario.”\nHere, different short clinical scenarios were generated\nalong with a few questions to test recall and understanding.\nPercent overall agreement¼100.00%.\nThe case studies generated consisted of hypothetical\npatient details, examination ﬁndings, a possible diagnosis,\nand treatment plan. All evaluators agreed with the useful-\nness of the role and accuracy of the contents. With suitable\nprompts, the LLM was able to generate multiple-choice\nobjective questions based on the scenarios generated and\nsubjective questions, for stimulating critical thinking and\nrecall among residents.\nSimulation of preoperative consultations :T h eL L Mw a s\nused to create preoperative consultation scenarios in plastic\nsurgery to generate realistic patient concerns and expect-\nations and present it to students. This would help students\npractice their communication skills and learn how to address\npatient concerns effectively.\nPrompts used: “simulate a preoperative consultation to\nhelp Plastic surgery residents students develop their commu-\nnication skills and learn how to address patient concerns\neffectively by generating realistic patient concerns and expect-\nations for a patient requiring free Latissimus dorsiﬂap cover\nfor a leg defect.”\n“simulate a preoperative consultation to help Plastic sur-\ngery residents students their communication skills and learn\nhow to address patient concerns effectively by generating\nrealistic patient concerns and expectations for a patient\nrequiring breast implant and augmentation for hypoplastic\nbreast due to Poland’s syndrome. Create two suitable questions\nfor residents based on the above scenario.\n”\nThe LLM generated two scenarios one on use of free\nlatissimus dorsi ﬂap for leg defect and second on use of\nbreast implants for breast augmentation in Poland\nsyndrome.\nPercent overall agreement¼100 and 66.67%, respectively,\nfor the two scenarios.\nThere was absolute agreement among all evaluators on\nthe usefulness of the role as well as clarity of the content\ngenerated. However, evaluators felt that content should be\nreviewed by instructors prior to administration to residents.\nProcedure step-by-step guidance: The aim was to use the\nLLM to provide detailed, step-by-step guidance on various\nplastic surgery procedures, enabling students to learn at\ntheir own pace and reinforcing their understanding of surgi-\ncal techniques.\nPrompts used:“list the operative steps of pollicization for\nthumb hypoplasia”\n“list the steps for microsurgical arterial anastomosis for a\nPlastic Surgery resident”\nThe evaluators were asked to score on accuracy, useful-\nness, and completeness of the content. While there were\nagreements on the usefulness of the content and role, there\nwere disagreements among authors on the accuracy, clarity,\nand completeness of the generated content.\nPercent overall agreement¼37.50 and 30%, respectively,\nfor the two procedures.\nHere, it is important to note that while the model gave\nfairly accurate procedural steps it did have inaccurate state-\nments for the pollicization prompt like“Neurovascular anas-\ntomosis: Reapproximate the radial digital neurovascular\nbundles to provide sensation and blood supply to the new\nthumb.” Neurovascular approximation is not done in polli-\ncization rather the index ﬁnger is rotated in to thumb\nposition over an intact neurovascular pedicle.\nEvaluators felt that some critical steps were missed out on\nin the content and were likely to cause confusion among\nresidents.\nIndian Journal of Plastic Surgery Vol. 56 No. 5/2023 © 2023. Association of Plastic Surgeons of India. All rights reserved.\nLLM in Plastic Surgery Training Mohapatra et al.416\n\nDecision-making support: The aim is to utilize LLM to\ncreate content to help plastic surgery residents weigh the\npros and cons of different surgical approaches or techniques,\npromoting informed decision-making. This decision-making\nprocess would allow the resident to develop a comprehen-\nsive understanding of various surgical techniques and their\napplications in different clinical scenarios.\nPrompt used: “give an example for a plastic surgery resi-\ndent on use of LLM for Decision-making Support: LLMs can be\nused as a tool to help students weigh the pros and cons of\ndifferent surgical approaches or techniques, promoting in-\nformed decision-making.”\nThe model created a content with a patient scenario\nhaving a leg defect in the lower third and gave a comparison\nbetween the two options, microvascular free latissimus dorsi\nﬂap and free anterolateral thighﬂap.\nPercent overall agreement¼36.67%.\nWhile the evaluators were in good agreement on the\naccuracy and usefulness of the content, there was disagree-\nment on clarity of the content. Moreover, the evaluators felt\nthat responses were too generic and additional factors (for\nexample, defect factors, patient factors, etc.) were not taken\ninto consideration by the LLM when generating responses.\nEthical considerations (generation): The LLM was used to\ngenerate content with the aim to stimulate discussions on\nethical dilemmas that may arise in plastic surgery practice,\nhelping students develop a strong ethical foundation.\nPrompt used:“generate discussions on ethical dilemmas on\na scenario that may arise in plastic surgery practice, to help\nresidents develop a strong ethical foundation.”\nThe LLM generated a case scenario of a female requesting\nrhinoplasty with unrealistic expectations, thus creating a\ndilemma for the operating surgeon to whether to operate or\nnot in such a situation. The model also identiﬁed discussion\npoints which may be taken into consideration to arrive at a\ndecision, namely, patients’ expectations, psychological fac-\ntors, informed consent, patient autonomy versus surgeon\nexpertise, andﬁnancial incentives.\nPercent overall agreement¼100.00%.\nAll the evaluators were in absolute agreement on the\nusefulness, accuracy, and clarity of the content generated.\nEnhancing surgical skills: The LLM was prompted to gen-\nerate content with the aim to provide tips and tricks to\nresidents for reﬁning surgical skills, including suturing tech-\nniques, tissue handling, and instrument use.\nPrompt used:“Give an example of use of LLM in Enhancing\nSurgical Skills: LLMs can provide tips and tricks for reﬁning\nsurgical skills, including suturing techniques, tissue handling,\nand instrument use.”\nThe LLM generated content directed toward a resident\nwanting to reﬁne their suturing techniques and tissue han-\ndling skills during a cleft lip repair procedure.\nPercent overall agreement¼36.67%.\nWhile there was absolute agreement between the eval-\nuators on the content clarity, there were disagreements\nregarding the accuracy and usefulness of the content. The\nevaluators felt that importance was not given to individual\nsteps in the generated content. They also felt that this being\nmore of a psychomotor role, LLM would not be able to assist\nresidents as a standalone module.\nPostoperative care and complication management :T h e\nLLM model was used to create content with the aim to\neducate students on postoperative care protocols and how\nto manage potential complications that may arise after\nplastic surgery procedures.\nPrompt used:“Suggest a postoperative care protocol for a\n10-month-old child undergone Bardach palatoplasty for com-\nplete cleft palate. Suggest potential complications and way to\nmanage them.”\nPercent overall agreement¼53.33%.\nThere was good agreement among the evaluators on the\ncontent clarity and usefulness, though some errors were\nidentiﬁed in the content generated. For example, for the\ngiven prompt one statement said“4. Wound care: Clean the\nsurgical site gently with a cotton swab dipped in sterile saline\nor water, ensuring that no food particles or debris accumulate\nat the site. Apply antibiotic ointment as recommended by the\nsurgeon,” which was not accurate for palatoplasty. Evalua-\ntors, though, felt that resident learning could be reinforced\non speciﬁed postoperative protocols through the generated\ncontent.\nDiscussion\nLLMs in general and ChatGPT (on which this study is based)\nin speciﬁc, are capable of generating answers to questions\nand prompts based on huge amount of text fed into the\nmodel for training the underlying language model.\n9 The\nanswers generated have been found to be accurate, readable,\nand even indistinguishable from human-generated text.10\nThis capability of ACS canbe exploited to generate summa-\nries to text, answer short and long answers, and generate\ncase scenarios. Inherent to the underlying model is the\ninability to reason or create original knowledge. Hence,\nthis makes it unsuitable as a primary source of factual\ninformation, a disclaimer also given by the creators of\nChatGPT on its chat interface. While there have been con-\ncerns on the use of ChatGPT in education and few universities\nand countries even going to the extent of blocking them,\nthere seems to be available opportunities to integrate these\nin learning activities to aid students and teachers.\n11\nPlastic surgery as a ﬁeld often encompasses a broad\nvariety of procedures that require a unique blend of art,\ncreativity, and precision. Well-trained LLMs can offer theo-\nretical knowledge and detailed technical insights, contribut-\ning to a cognitive foundation. However, the actual execution\nin the operative room, and the dexterity it demands, cannot\nbe taught by an LLM.\nWe could identify a few scenarios where the LLM could in\ngeneral be utilized to play the role of a TA and aid plastic\nsurgery residents in particular. In addition, these models\ncould also be used by students to obtain feedback and gain\nreﬂection which itself stimulates critical thinking. Each\ndomain of Bloom’s Taxonomy, namely, the cognitive, affec-\ntive, and psychomotor, can be addressed to some extent by\nthe LLM (\n►Table 3). For the cognitive domain, LLMs like\nIndian Journal of Plastic Surgery Vol. 56 No. 5/2023 © 2023. Asso ciation of Plastic Surgeons of India. All rights reserved.\nLLM in Plastic Surgery Training Mohapatra et al. 417\n\nChatGPT4 (as in our study) can provide conceptual knowl-\nedge and facilitate analytical thinking by engaging in dis-\ncussions or scenario simulations. However, as we found in\nour study, the factual accuracy of the present models cannot\nbe relied upon. LLM development being a rapidly changing\nﬁeld, this limitation may soon be overcome if the models are\ntrained upon subject-speciﬁc technical content and have\naccess to latest information and guidelines. The affective\ndomain can be approached through discussing case scenarios\nthat focus on empathy and professional values. For the\npsychomotor domain, while the LLM cannot perform physi-\ncal demonstrations, it can provide step-by-step guidance,\nexplanations of techniques, and respond to queries on prac-\ntical aspects.\nWhile the LLM was able to carry out the different roles of a\nTA in this study, it is important to identify roles which it could\ncarry out adequately without a secondary check, that is,\ninteractive case studies (generation), simulation of preopera-\ntive consultations, and generation of ethical considerations\nscenarios. The model was found to need secondary check of\ncontent generated in other roles. This was because the output\nin the former was more of a language output in a clinical\nscenario with low emphasis on content accuracy and the\nmodel has been adequately designed to carry out such activi-\nties. Activities needing presentation of factual information\nwhere there is a high emphasis on content accuracy will not be\na suitable independent role for an LLM. Such generated content\nhas to be validated by a subject expert.\nIt has to be remembered that the quality of output in LLM\ndepends on the preciseness of the input prompt. As the\nmodel has been designed to identify words and present\noutput in response to these words, a precise, well-described\ninput prompt would generate an appropriate output. None-\ntheless, it is preferable to check the accuracy of output\nresponses.\nTAs, albeit human, have been supporting teachers and\nstudents in an educational system. The idea of a virtual TA\nseems innovative and useful, where such assistants can be\navailable at the ﬁngertips of residents undergoing plastic\nsurgical training.\n12,13\nThe Indian National Medical Commission’s current Com-\npetency-Based Medical Education model can be incorporat-\ned into the LLM’s virtual tutor task. Using the“Must Know,\nNeed to Know, Good to Know” model, the LLM can be\ndesigned to prioritize information in response to queries,\nbased on the categorization of these domains. For instance,\nfor a“Must Know” topic, the LLM could provide comprehen-\nsive details while for a“Good to Know” topic, it might offer a\nbrief overview unless more details are requested. In addition,\nthe LLMs’ capacity in objective structured clinical examina-\ntion-based teaching and evaluation can be an interesting\navenue for future research.\nIn the present era of evidence-based medicine, LLMs like\nChatGPT4 can be trained to generate text based on the level\nof evidence available. However, it is important to note that at\npresent ChatGPT4 cannot independently evaluate the quality\nof the evidence since its knowledge is based on preexisting\ndata up to its last training cutoff, which for ChatGPT4 is\nSeptember 2021. In future, these capabilities can be aug-\nmented by model training and allowing access to latest\ninformation.\nWith rapid strides in the development of AI in general and\nLLMs in particular, the possibility of having virtual TAs seems\nreal. These language models have been trained on humon-\ngous amounts of textual data and their strength lies in\nrapidly generating text-based outputs to user inputs. Al-\nthough all these models are in experimental phase and have\nnot been converted into commercial applications, there lies\nan opportunity where the foundational models of ChatGPT\nand other LLMs can beﬁne-tuned to subject-speciﬁc activi-\nties and be made available as a personal chatbot.\n14 Studies\nhave demonstrated the use of these models as virtual surgi-\ncal assistants.15\nThe advantages of LLMs also lie in the fact that most of the\npresent generational learners are comfortable with the use of\ntechnology in their daily academic lives and so also the\nubiquitousness of mobile devices in education and health\ncare.16 LLMs can thus behave as personal TAs to them aiding\nin cognitive and to some extent affective domains of learn-\ning. The conversational nature of output in ChatGPT is likely\nto retain learner attention and this makes it more attractive\nas a guide compared to routine search engines. They can\nassist in the cognitive domain of learning by aiding in\nknowledge acquisition, comprehension, and application.\nTable 3 List of identiﬁed roles for LLM as a teaching assistant and the domains of the roles according to Bloom’s Taxonomy\nSl. no.

Hence, it is strictly recommended\nnot to enter personal information into the system. Other\nknown concerns include environmental concerns due to the\nuse of massive amounts of computational resources which\nconsume signiﬁcant energy and contribute toward carbon\nemissions.\n17,18\nThis study has tried to evaluate the role of LLM in plastic\nsurgery residency programs and is theﬁrst such study to use\nChatGPT4 model. The generated responses have been objec-\ntively and independently scored by the evaluators and inter-\nobserver agreements have been calculated for the responses.\nThe study has a few limitations, including a smaller number\nof evaluators and use of only one LLM although multiple such\nmodels are available. In addition, scores of a few responses\nand clinical scenarios of plastic surgery could only be evalu-\nated. It is likely the study outcomes will change with a higher\nnumber of evaluators and case scenarios. Further larger\nstudies with randomization, response evaluation by larger\nnumber of evaluators, or response evaluation even by resi-\ndents could throw in more insights.\nThe future of education is an evolving landscape, where\nmodels like ChatGPT and others will play signiﬁcant roles.\nWith gradual acceptance of LLM in higher education, it is a\nmatter of time when these models will prove to be useful as\nTA in the domain of plastic surgery education.\n19,20\nConclusion\nThis study has attempted to identify the use of LLM for\nresident training in plastic surgery. Incorporating LLMs into\nthe educational arsenal of plastic surgery residency pro-\ngrams can provide a dynamic, interactive, and individualized\nlearning experience for residents and prove to be worthy TAs\nof future.\nConﬂict of Interest\nNone declared.\nReferences\n1 Rouse M.
