    "abstract": "This paper describes a thermal design using epoxy potting for high frequency transformer (HFT) for medium voltage high power electronic applications, namely emerging solid-state transformers. To address HFT’s thermal stress problem, thermal performance of the HFT with air and epoxy potting cooling method are both simulated by magnetothermal-fluid coupling method (MTFCM). The effectiveness of the simulation analysis is verified in a 100 kW DC-DC resonant converter. Influencing factors including distance between the high frequency transformer and the metal enclosure, epoxy thermal conductivity and heat sink placements are simulated and analyzed. Finally, an optimal cooling structure is proposed for future high power HFTs.",
