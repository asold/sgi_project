  "abstract": "The metaverse, a 3-dimensional digital platform that enables users to interact and engage in realistic virtual activities beyond time and space limitations, has garnered significant investment across industries, particularly in healthcare. In the medical field, the metaverse shows promise as a digital therapeutic platform to enhance interaction between medical professionals and patients. Concurrently, generative artificial intelligence, especially large language models, is being integrated into healthcare for applications in data analysis, image recognition, and natural language processing. In urology, large language models (LLMs) support are increasingly used in urology for tasks such as image diagnosis, data processing, patient education, and treatment assistance in order to provide significant support in clinical settings. By combining LLMs with the immersive capabilities of the metaverse, new possibilities emerge to improve urologic treatment in areas that require consistent treatments, habit formation, and long-term management. This paper reviews current research and applications of LLMs in urology, discusses the challenges associated with their use including data quality, bias, security, and ethical issues, and explores the need for regulatory standards. Furthermore, it highlights the potential of a metaverse-based digital platform to improve urologic care and streamline information exchange to maximize the benefits of this integrated approach in future healthcare applications.",
