It plays a central role in intelligent\nsystems for problem-solving, decision-making, and\ncritical thinking. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022a;\nOpenAI, 2023) have exhibited emergent ability to\n“reason” like human (Wei et al., 2022a). When\nprompted with step-wise explanations of reasoning\n(“chain of thoughts”), or a simple prompt “Let’s\nthink step by step.”, these models are able to an-\nswer questions with explicit reasoning steps (Wei\net al., 2022b; Kojima et al., 2022).\n1Code and data are publicly available at https://github.\ncom/teacherpeterpan/Logic-LLM.\nProblem Formulator \nSymbolic Reasoner \nResult Interpreter \nSymbolic Formulation\nSymbolic Result\nProblemGoal\nAnswer\nSelf-Refine\nFigure 1: Overview of our LOGIC -LM framework.\nDespite the advances of LLMs, they still strug-\ngle with complex logical reasoning problems (Liu\net al., 2023b). Recent studies (Golovneva et al.,\n2023; Ribeiro et al., 2023b; Lyu et al., 2023) found\nthat LLMs occasionally make unfaithful reason-\ning, i.e., the derived conclusion does not follow\nthe previously generated reasoning chain. While\nchain-of-thought may imitate human reasoning pro-\ncesses, the fundamental nature of LLMs remains\nthat of black-box probabilistic models, lacking a\nmechanism to guarantee the faithfulness of reason-\ning (Shanahan, 2022). In contrast, symbolic infer-\nence engines, such as expert systems (Metaxiotis\net al., 2002), are faithful and transparent because\nthe reasoning is based on symbolic-represented\nknowledge and follows well-defined inference rules\nthat adhere to logical principles. The main obsta-\ncle is how to accurately translate a problem into\nsymbolic representations, considering the inherent\nambiguity and flexibility of natural language. This\nis precisely where LLMs excel, making LLMs a\npromising complement to symbolic solvers.\nThis drives our exploration of neuro-symbolic\nmethods that integrate LLMs with symbolic reason-\ning. As illustrated in Figure 1, we present LOGIC -\n3806\nLM, a novel framework that decomposes a logical\nreasoning problem into three stages: Problem For-\nmulation, Symbolic Reasoning, and Result Inter-\npretation. During problem formulation, an LLM\nconverts the natural language description of the\nproblem into an appropriate symbolic formulation,\nidentifying key entities, facts, and rules present\nin the problem statement. Subsequently, at the\nsymbolic reasoning stage, a deterministic symbolic\nsolver performs inference on the symbolic formula-\ntion. Lastly, a result interpreter explains the output\nand maps it to the correct answer. By incorporating\nLLMs with symbolic solvers, we can exploit the\nrobust natural language understanding capabilities\nof LLMs to precisely represent the problem using\nsymbolic representations, while also taking advan-\ntage of the logical faithfulness and transparency\noffered by symbolic solvers. To improve the accu-\nracy of the symbolic parsing, we also incorporate\nthe idea of self-refinement to iteratively revise the\ngenerated logical form using the error messages\nfrom the symbolic solver as feedback.\nWe showcase the adaptability and effective-\nness of LOGIC -LM on five logical reasoning\ndatasets: ProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2021), PrOn-\ntoQA (Saparov and He, 2023), FOLIO (Han et al.,\n2022), AR-LSAT (Zhong et al., 2022), and the Log-\nicalDeduction dataset from BigBench (Srivastava\net al., 2022). These datasets cover a wide range of\nlogical reasoning problems, including:\n•Deductive Reasoning problems\n•First-Order Logic (FOL) reasoning problems\n•Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)\n•Analytical Reasoning (AR) problems\nWe integrate four types of symbolic inference tools\ntailored to these problems: 1) logic programming\nengine that supports deductive reasoning through\nforward/backward chaining; 2) FOL inference en-\ngine that derives new conclusions based on FOL\nrules and facts, 3) constraint optimization engine\nthat provides solvers for CSP over finite domains,\nand 4) boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) solver\nthat solves analytical reasoning problems.\nOur evaluations show that the strategy of inte-\ngrating LLMs with symbolic solvers performs sig-\nnificantly better than purely relying on LLMs for\nlogical reasoning, with an average improvement\nof 39.2% over the standard prompting and 18.4%\nover the chain-of-thought prompting (§ 4.1). We\nalso find that LOGIC -LM becomes increasingly ef-\nfective as the required reasoning depth increases\n(§ 4.3). Finally, by analyzing the impact of self-\nrefinement, we highlight the effectiveness of incre-\nmentally revising symbolic formalizations when\ninteracting with the symbolic solver (§ 4.4).\n2 Related Work\nLanguage Models for Logical Reasoning. Re-\ncent works in adapting LLMs for logical reasoning\ntasks can be broadly categorized into two groups:\n1) fine-tuning approaches that optimize LLMs’ rea-\nsoning ability through fine-tuning or training spe-\ncialized modules (Clark et al., 2020; Tafjord et al.,\n2022; Yang et al., 2022), and 2)in-context learning\napproaches that design special prompts to elicit\nLLMs’ step-by-step reasoning capabilities. Typical\nmethods include chain-of-thought prompting (Wei\net al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2023) that generates ex-\nplanations before the final answer and the least-to-\nmost prompting (Zhou et al., 2023) that breaks the\nproblem down into simpler components that can\nbe solved individually. Both the above approaches\nperform reasoning directly over natural language\n(NL), providing greater flexibility than symbolic-\nbased reasoning. However, the intrinsic complexity\nand ambiguity of NL also bring undesired issues\nsuch as unfaithful reasoning and hallucinations.\nDifferent from prior works, we use symbolic\nlanguage as the basic unit of reasoning. This effec-\ntively transfers the burden of executing complex,\nprecise reasoning from LLMs to more reliable, in-\nterpretable external symbolic solvers. Simultane-\nously, we leverage the strong in-context learning\nability of LLMs to formulate the NL-based prob-\nlem into suitable symbolic representations, thus\nmaintaining the benefit of flexibility.\nAlthough prior works (Mao et al., 2019; Gupta\net al., 2020; Manhaeve et al., 2021; Cai et al., 2021;\nTian et al., 2022; Pryor et al., 2023) also propose\nneuro-symbolic methods to combine neural net-\nworks with symbolic reasoning, these methods suf-\nfer from limitations such as hand-crafted or spe-\ncialized module designs that are not easily gen-\neralizable, or brittleness due to the difficulty of\noptimization. In contrast, we propose a more gen-\neralizable framework that integrates modern LLMs\nwith symbolic logic without the need for training\nor designing complex problem-specific modules.\nTool-augmented Language Models. Language\nmodels have inherent limitations such as the inabil-\nity to access up-to-date information, take actions,\nor perform precise mathematical reasoning.

Recent works (Gao et al., 2023; Chen et al.,\n2022) have achieved improved performance on\narithmetic reasoning tasks by generating Python\nprograms that specify the reasoning procedure as\nchained commands in the order of execution. How-\never, this idea has not been extended to logical\nreasoning problems, primarily due to the challenge\nof representing their highly “non-linear” reasoning\nprocedure (e.g., hypothesizing, case-by-case analy-\nsis, and the process of elimination) with functional\nprogramming. Our work provides a novel way\nto solve this within the framework of augmented\nLLMs. Instead of parsing the problem-solving pro-\ncedure as programs, we only describe the problem\nwith symbolic language using LLMs and then of-\nfload the reasoning to external symbolic solvers.\nAuto-Formalization. The concept of convert-\ning natural language into symbolic representations\nhas been widely adopted in auto-formalization for\nmathematical reasoning (Wu et al., 2022; Drori\net al., 2022; He-Yueya et al., 2023; Jiang et al.,\n2023). These works demonstrate the proficiency\nof LLMs in translating a considerable fraction of\nmathematical problems into formal specifications\ndefined in tools like SymPy (Meurer et al., 2017),\nIsabelle/HOL (Paulson, 1994), and Lean (de Moura\net al., 2015). Mathematical reasoning can be con-\nsidered a specialized subset of logical reasoning,\nprimarily focused on numeric deductions. Due to\nthis numeric specificity, mathematical problems are\noften more readily translatable to symbolic forms.\nIn contrast, logical reasoning covers a wider array\nof problem types, often requiring a deeper under-\nstanding of world knowledge and commonsense\nfor effective parsing into symbolic forms. Despite\nplenty of works studying mathematical reasoning,\nour work pioneers in extending the concept of auto-\nformalization to a broader range of logical reason-\ning tasks with modern LLMs.\n3 L OGIC -LM\nAs shown in Figure 2, the inputs of our model are\na logical reasoning problem P described in natural\nlanguage, along with a goal G in the form of a\nmultiple-choice or free-form question. LOGIC -LM\nthen follows a problem formulation-and-reasoning\nparadigm to solve the problem.\n3808\nIn the Problem Formulationstage, we prompt an\nLLM to translate the problem and the goal into a\ntask-specific symbolic language. In the Symbolic\nReasoning stage, we call a deterministic symbolic\nsolver, e.g., a logic programming engine, to ob-\ntain a symbolic-represented answer. Finally, an\nLLM- or rule-based Result Interpreter is respon-\nsible for translating the answer back to natural\nlanguage. Using this approach, the reasoning is\nguaranteed to be faithful as long as the problem\nformulation is correct since the answer A is the\nresult of executing deterministic algorithms (e.g.,\nforward/backward-chaining) embedded within the\nsymbolic reasoner. Compared to previous methods\nbased on chain-of-thought, our framework reduces\nthe burden of LLMs by shifting their focus from\n“solving the problem by reasoning step-by-step” to\n“representing the problem in symbolic language”.\n3.1 Problem Formulator\nIntuitively, LLMs may struggle with directly solv-\ning complex reasoning problems. However, they\nhave demonstrated a notable ability to comprehend\ntextual inputs and translate them into formal pro-\ngrams, such as mathematical equations (He-Yueya\net al., 2023) or Python codes (Gao et al., 2023). We\nposit that this capability to formulate problems into\ndifferent languages can be extended to symbolic\nlanguages as well. We leverage the few-shot gener-\nalization ability of LLMs to achieve this. By pro-\nviding the LLM with detailed instructions about the\ngrammar of the symbolic language, alongside a few\ndemonstrations as in-context examples, we observe\nthat LLMs, like InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022b)\nand GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), can effectively follow\nthe instructions to identify key entities, facts, and\nrules present in the problem statement, and then\ntranslate these elements into symbolic language\nfollowing our defined grammar.\nSpecifically, we use four different symbolic for-\nmulations to cover four common types of logical\nreasoning problems: deductive reasoning , first-\norder logic reasoning, constraint satisfaction prob-\nlem, and analytical reasoning . These formula-\ntions provide a foundation for translating natu-\nral language-based problem statements. By defin-\ning additional problem-specific formulations, our\nframework retains the flexibility to accommodate a\nwider range of reasoning tasks. Next, we will delve\ninto the grammar of each symbolic formulation.\nExamples of each problem type are in Figure 2.\nLogic Programming (LP) Language. Deduc-\ntive reasoning typically starts from known facts and\nrules, and iteratively makes new inferences until the\ngoal statement can be proved or disproved (Poole\nand Mackworth, 2010). The Prolog logic pro-\ngramming language (Clocksin and Mellish, 2003;\nKörner et al., 2022) is arguably the most prominent\nsymbolic language to describe deductive reasoning\nproblems. We adopt its grammar to represent a\nproblem as facts, rules, and queries.\n•Facts: a fact F is a simple statement with a\npredicate and a set of arguments, formulated as\nP(a1, ··· , an), where P is the predicate name and\neach argument ai can be a variable, entity, num-\nber, or bool. For example, Age(Peter, 31) means\n“Peter’s age is 31”, and MadeOfIron(Nails, True)\nrepresents the fact “Nails are made of iron”.\n•Rules: rules are written in the form of clauses:\nF1 ∧···∧ Fm →Fm+1 ∧···∧ Fn, where each Fi is\na fact and the rule means “if the facts F1, ··· , Fm\nare true, then the facts Fm+1 ···Fn are also true.”\n•Queries: a query Q is simply another fact re-\nquired to be proved based on known facts and rules.\nFirst-Order Logic (FOL). While the logic pro-\ngramming language efficiently represents common\ndeductive reasoning problems, it may fail to rep-\nresent more complex first-order logic (FOL) prob-\nlems. To address this, we also include the FOL\ngrammar (Enderton, 2001) in Appendix A. A prob-\nlem is then parsed into a list of FOL formulas,\nwhich are divided into Premises (the known in-\nformation from the problem) and Conclusion (the\nunknown formula to be proved). An example sen-\ntence and its FOL formula are given in Table 1.\nConstraint Satisfaction (CSP). Constraint sat-\nisfaction problems (CSPs) (Kumar, 1992) aims\nto find the value assignment of a set of objects\nthat satisfy a number of constraints. A CSP\nis often defined as a triple (X, D, C), where\nX = {x1, ··· , xn}is a set of variables, D =\n{D1, ··· , Dn}is a set of their respective domains\nof values, and C = {C1, ··· , Cm}is a set of con-\nstraints. Each variable xi can take on the values\nin the nonempty domain Di. Every constraint Cj\nis a pair ⟨tj, Rj⟩, where tj ⊂X is a subset of k\nvariables and Rj is a k-ary relation on the corre-\nsponding subset of domains Dj. We use the above\nsyntax to define a CSP problem as variables, do-\nmains, and constraints. An example is given in\nboth Figure 2 and Table 1.\n3809\nProblem Formulation Example Solver DatasetNL Sentence Symbolic Formulation\nDeductive\nReasoning LP\nIf the circuit is complete and\nthe circuit has the light bulb\nthen the light bulb is glowing.\nComplete(Circuit, True)∧\nHas(Circuit, LightBulb)\n→Glowing(LightBulb, True)\nPyke ProntoQA,\nProofWriter\nFirst-Order\nLogic FOL A Czech person wrote a book\nin 1946.\n∃x2∃x1(Czech(x1)∧Author(x2, x1)\n∧Book(x2)∧Publish(x2,1946)) Prover9 FOLIO\nConstraint\nSatisfaction CSP\nOn a shelf, there are five books.\nThe blue book is to the right\nof the yellow book.\nblue_book∈{1,2,3,4,5}\nyellow_book∈{1,2,3,4,5}\nblue_book>yellow_book\npython-\nconstraintLogicalDeduction\nAnalytical\nReasoning SAT Xena and exactly three other\ntechnicians repair radios\nrepairs(Xena, radios)∧\nCount([t:technicians], t̸=Xena\n∧repairs(t, radios))) == 3)\nZ3 AR-LSAT\nTable 1: A summary of the symbolic formulations (with examples) and symbolic solvers we use for the five datasets\nin our study, representing four different types of logical reasoning problems.\nBoolean Satisfiability (SAT) Formulation. SAT\nis the problem of deciding if there is an assignment\nto the variables of a Boolean formula such that\nthe formula is satisfied. Many analytical reasoning\nproblems can be formulated as SAT problems. We\nadopt the grammar defined in Ye et al. (2023) to\nformulate an SAT problem Pas (Φ, T, Q), where\nΦ is a set of constraints defined under the theory T,\nand Qis the query of interest.\nTable 1 summarizes the four types of logical\nreasoning problems, their typical datasets, and the\nsymbolic formulation used to represent each type of\nproblem. We also give an example of a natural lan-\nguage statement with its corresponding symbolic\nformulation for each type. Appendix C shows the\nfull prompts we use for the problem formulator.\nTo teach LLMs to better align each statement with\nits corresponding symbolic form, we use the for-\nmat SYMBOLIC _FORMULA ::: NL_ STATEMENT\nin in-context examples to enable better grounding.\n3.2 Symbolic Reasoner\nAfter the problem formulator parses the problem\nP and the goal G into symbolic representations\nˆP and ˆG, we call a deterministic external solver\ndepending on the task, to obtain the answer A. Ta-\nble 1 summarizes the symbolic solvers we use for\neach type of logical reasoning problem.\nLP System. For deductive reasoning, we incor-\nporate the Pyke expert system (Frederiksen, 2008),\nwhich makes inferences based on the logic pro-\ngramming language. In response to a query, Pyke\nfirst creates a knowledge base, populating it with\nknown facts and rules. Subsequently, it applies\nforward- and backward-chaining algorithms to in-\nfer new facts and substantiate the goal.\nFOL Prover. We use Prover92 as the FOL in-\nference engine. Prover9 is an automated theorem\nprover that supports first-order logic and equational\nlogic. It initially converts FOL statements to con-\njunctive normal form (CNF) and then performs\nresolution (Robinson, 1965) on the CNF to deduce\nwhether a conclusion is true, false, or unknown.\nCSP Solver. Solving a CSP is to find value as-\nsignments for all variables that satisfy all given\nconstraints. Commonly used algorithms for this\ntask include backtracking, constraint propagation,\nand local search variants. To this end, we incor-\nporate the python-constraint3 package which\noffers solvers for CSPs over finite domains.\nSAT Solver. For solving SAT problems, we use\nthe Z3 theorem prover (de Moura and Bjørner,\n2008), a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)\nsolver developed by Microsoft4. The SMT solver\nprovides algorithms to determine whether a set of\nmathematical formulas is satisfiable. It generalizes\nthe SAT problems to more complex formulas in-\nvolving real numbers, integers, and various data\nstructures such as lists, arrays, bit vectors, and\nstrings. A lot of real-world analytical reasoning\nproblems can be represented as problems of solv-\ning a system of equations.\n3.3 Self-Refiner\nFor complex problems, generating the correct log-\nical form may become challenging for LLMs. To\naddress this, we introduce a self-refinement mod-\nule that learns to modify inaccurate logical for-\n2https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/\n3https://github.com/python-constraint/\npython-constraint\n4https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3\n3810\nmulations using the error messages from the sym-\nbolic reasoner as feedback. Recent works (Chen\net al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023) have adopted sim-\nilar ideas to improve code generation, by teaching\nLLMs to debug their predicted programs via few-\nshot demonstrations. Here we extend this idea to\nrefine generated logic representations. If the sym-\nbolic solver returns an execution error, we instruct\nthe LLM to refine the incorrect logical form, by\nprompting it with the erroneous logic form, the\nsolver’s error message, and a set of demonstrations\nshowing common error cases (e.g., a free variable\nis not bounded to any quantifier in FOL) and their\nremedies. We run this process iteratively until ei-\nther no error messages are returned, or the maxi-\nmum number of allowable revisions is reached.\n3.4 Result Interpreter\nFinally, the result interpreter translates the results\nreturned from the symbolic solver back to a natural\nlanguage answer. For certain problems, this can\nbe achieved through predefined rules; for example,\nmapping Entailment to true. However, this pro-\ncess can be more complex for CSPs, e.g., translat-\ning {convertible: 1, tractor: 2, minivan: 3} to “the\nconvertible is the oldest.”. To handle these varying\nlevels of complexity, we designed both rule-based\nand LLM-based result interpreters. Details of the\nresult interpreter are given in Appendix D.\n4 Experiments\nDatasets. We evaluate LOGIC -LM on five com-\nmon logical reasoning datasets, as follows.\nPrOntoQA (Saparov and He, 2023) is a recent\nsynthetic dataset created to analyze the capacity of\nLLMs for deductive reasoning. We use the hardest\nfictional characters version of the dataset, based on\nthe results in Saparov and He (2023). Each version\nis divided into different subsets depending on the\nnumber of reasoning hops required. We use the\nhardest 5-hop subset for evaluation. Each question\nin PrOntoQA aims to validate a new fact’s veracity,\nsuch as “True or false: Alex is not shy.”.\nProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2021) is another\ncommonly used dataset for deductive logical rea-\nsoning. Compared with PrOntoQA, the problems\nare expressed in a more naturalistic language form.\nWe use the open-world assumption (OW A) subset\nin which each example is a (problem, goal) pair\nand the label is one of { PROVED, DISPROVED,\nUNKNOWN}. The dataset is divided into five parts,\neach part requiring 0, ≤1, ≤2, ≤3, and ≤5 hops\nof reasoning, respectively. We evaluate the hardest\ndepth-5 subset. To reduce overall experimentation\ncosts, we randomly sample 600 examples in the\ntest set and ensure a balanced label distribution.\nFOLIO (Han et al., 2022) is a challenging\nexpert-written dataset for logical reasoning. The\nproblems are mostly aligned with real-world knowl-\nedge and use highly natural wordings, and the ques-\ntions require complex first-order logic reasoning to\nsolve. We use the entire FOLIO test set for evalua-\ntion, consisting of 204 examples.\nLogicalDeduction is a challenging logical rea-\nsoning task from the BigBench (Srivastava et al.,\n2022) collaborative benchmark. The problems are\nmostly about deducing the order of a sequence of\nobjects from a minimal set of conditions. We use\nthe full test set consisting of 300 examples.\nAR-LSAT (Zhong et al., 2022) is a dataset that\ncollects all analytical logic reasoning questions\nfrom the Law School Admission Test from 1991 to\n2016. We use the test set which has 231 multiple-\nchoice questions. AR-LSAT is particularly chal-\nlenging, with state-of-the-art models only achiev-\ning performance slightly better than random guess-\ning (Liang et al., 2022; Ribeiro et al., 2023a).\nWe convert all examples into a standard multiple-\nchoice format, comprising a problem statement, a\nquestion, and potential answers, as shown in Fig-\nure 2. We also select 1-5 examples from the train-\ning set of each dataset as in-context examples. De-\ntailed data statistics are in Appendix B.\nBaselines. We compare our model against two\nbaselines that depend solely on LLMs for logical\nreasoning: 1) Standard LLMs, which leverage in-\ncontext learning to directly answer the question;\nand 2) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022b),\nwhich adopts a step-by-step problem-solving ap-\nproach, generating explanations before providing\nthe final answer. We separately evaluate the set-\ntings that ChatGPT ( gpt-3.5-turbo), GPT-3.5\n(text-davinci-003) (Ouyang et al., 2022a) and\nGPT-4 (gpt-4) (OpenAI, 2023) serve as the under-\nlying LLMs for all models. To ensure fair com-\nparisons, we use the same in-context examples for\nall models. For reproducible results, we set the\ntemperature to 0 and select the response with the\nhighest probability from LLMs. Since all examples\nare formed as multiple-choice questions, we eval-\nuate model performance based on the accuracy of\nselecting the correct answer.\n3811\nDataset ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) GPT-4 (gpt-4)\nStandard CoT Logic-LM Standard CoT Logic-LM Standard CoT Logic-LM\nPrOntoQA 47.40 67.80 61.00 51.80 83.00 85.00 77.40 98.79 83.20\nProofWriter 35.50 49.17 58.33 36.16 48.33 71.45 52.67 68.11 79.66\nFOLIO 45.09 57.35 62.74 54.60 57.84 61.27 69.11 70.58 78.92\nLogicalDeduction 40.00 42.33 65.67 41.33 48.33 62.00 71.33 75.25 87.63\nAR-LSAT 20.34 17.31 26.41 22.51 22.51 25.54 33.33 35.06 43.04\nTable 2: Accuracy of standard promoting (Standard), chain-of-thought promoting (CoT), and our method (LOGIC -\nLM, without self-refinement) on five reasoning datasets. The best results within each base LLM are highlighted.\n4.1 Main Results\nWe report the results of LOGIC -LM (without self-\nrefinement) and baselines in Table 2. For LOGIC -\nLM, a symbolic solver does not return an answer\nwhen there are grammar errors in the symbolic\nformulation. For these un-executable cases, we\nfall back on using chain-of-thought to predict the\nanswer. We have three major observations.\n1. Logic-LM significantly outperforms stan-\ndard LLMs and CoT across all datasets. With GPT-\n3.5, our method outperforms standard LLM on all\ndatasets, with an average improvement of 39.2%.\nThis highlights the benefit of combining LLMs\nwith external symbolic solvers for logical reason-\ning. LOGIC -LM also improves CoT by a large mar-\ngin of 18.4% on average, showing that offloading\nthe reasoning to symbolic solvers greatly improves\nfaithfulness compared with pure language-based\nreasoning with CoT.\n2. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 by a large margin\nof 48.46% on average for the standard prompting.\nThis aligns with the assertion that the main en-\nhancement of GPT-4 lies in its ability to carry out\ncomplex reasoning (OpenAI, 2023). Although this\nmay indicate that the logical reasoning capability\ncan be boosted by scaling up the LLM, we observe\nthat GPT-4 still makes numerous unfaithful reason-\ning errors. By delegating the reasoning to symbolic\nsolvers, our method can further improve GPT-4\nby an average of 24.98% and 10.44% for standard\nprompting and CoT prompting, respectively.\n3. While integrating CoT generally enhances\nLLM performance, we find its benefits compara-\ntively less substantial or even negative on FOLIO,\nLogicalDeduction, and AR-LSAT, with a modest\nimprovement of 11.75%, 9.41%, and -3.2%, re-\nspectively. On the contrary, the benefits of CoT\non ProntoQA and ProofWriter are 51.59% and\n33.82%, respectively.

We present the percentage of executable\nlogical formulations (Exe_Rate) together with the accu-\nracy of the execution (Exe_Acc). SR represents before\n(−) and after (+) self-refinement.\nthat CoT emulates human forward-chain reasoning:\nbeginning with known facts and sequentially de-\nriving new conclusions until the goal is met. This\nreasoning style aligns well with problems in the\nPrOntoQA and ProofWriter datasets. However,\nFOL and CSP problems often necessitate more\nsophisticated reasoning strategies that are “non-\nlinear” compared to standard forward-chain rea-\nsoning. These include hypothesizing, conditioning,\nrecursive inference, and the process of elimina-\ntion. Compared to CoT, the integration of symbolic\nsolvers is better suited to these reasoning styles,\nhence yielding a more marked improvement on FO-\nLIO (+21.85%), LogicalDeduction (+45.67%), and\nAR-LSAT (+24.14%).\n4.2 Effectiveness of Problem Formulator\nWe then evaluate how well LLM can translate a\ngiven problem into the symbolic formulation used\nby each symbolic solver. In Table 3, we report the\npercentage of symbolic formulations that are exe-\ncutable by the corresponding symbolic solver for\n3812\n1\n57.752.647.338.333.5\n76.373.665.359.451\n81.777.373.671.371.1\n30405060708090\n0 1 2 3 5Reasoning Depth\nStandardCoTLogic-LMAccuracy\nFigure 3: Accuracy of different models for increasing\nsize of reasoning depth on the ProofWriter dataset.\neach dataset (Exe_Rate). Generally, LLM demon-\nstrates high proficiency in transcribing problems\ninto symbolic formats, evidenced by its near 100%\nExe_Rate on ProntoQA, ProofWriter, and Logi-\ncalDeduction. However, the high performance on\nthese datasets is somewhat anticipated, given that\ntheir problems are mostly synthetically generated,\nlimiting language variability. When it comes to\ndatasets comprising real-world, expertly crafted\nproblems, such as FOLIO and AR-LSAT, GPT-\n4’s performance is notably less promising, with\nExe_Rate scores of 79.9% and 32.6% respectively.\nThis discrepancy underscores the inherent chal-\nlenges associated with converting real-world prob-\nlems into their logical equivalents.\nExe_Rate only reflects the grammar correctness\nof the logical form. We also report the accuracy\nof the executable samples ( Exe_Acc) to measure\nthe semantic correctness. We find that logical\nforms generated by GPT-4 generally achieve high\nExe_Acc, even for the most challenging AR-LSAT\ndataset. Such performance accentuates the poten-\ntial of symbolic solvers in bolstering the model’s\nlogical reasoning prowess, contingent on the pre-\ncise translation of problems into symbolic forms.\n4.3 Robustness of Reasoning\nIncorporating symbolic solvers also leads to more\nrobust reasoning. To illustrate this, we report\nthe performance of LOGIC -LM and baselines for\nquestions of varying complexity levels. We ran-\ndomly selected 300 examples from each subset\nof ProofWriter, ensuring a balanced label distri-\nbution. The problems in these subsets require 0,\n<=1, <=2, <=3, and <=5 hops of reasoning, respec-\ntively. The results, shown in Figure 3, indicate\nthat LOGIC -LM becomes increasingly effective as\nthe required reasoning depth increases. For exam-\n57.8761.2762.2564.5663.8470.58\n78.9278.4379.979.41\n55606570758085\n0 1 2 3\nCoT (GPT-3.5)Logic-LM (GPT-3.5)CoT (GPT-4)Logic-LM (GPT-4)\nRoundsGPT-3.566.7%79.4%82.4%84.3%GPT-4 79.9%85.3%85.3%85.8%\nAccuracy\nFigure 4: The accuracy for different rounds of self-\nrefinement, with the corresponding executable rates.\nple, LOGIC -LM outperforms CoT by 7.1%, 5.0%,\n12.7%, 20.0%, and 39.4% on depth-0, depth-1,\ndepth-2, depth-4, and depth-5 problems, respec-\ntively. In LOGIC -LM, multi-step logical reasoning\nis delegated to external symbolic solvers, thereby\ntransitioning the challenge of LLM from problem-\nsolving to problem representation. Ideally, the com-\nplexity of formally representing a problem state-\nment in logical form should remain relatively con-\nstant, regardless of whether the questions require\nsimple or complex reasoning. The trends in Fig-\nure 3 validate this assumption. The performance of\nStandard and CoT declines precipitously with the\nescalation of problem complexity. However, this\ntrend is less prominent for LOGIC -LM, indicating\nthat the robust reasoning capabilities provided by\nexternal solvers substantially mitigate performance\ndegradation for complex reasoning problems.\n4.4 Impact of Self-Refinement\nIn Table 3, we find that self-refinement is effective\nin fixing the in-executable symbolic formulations,\nincreasing the Exe_Rate by 5.01 on average. For\nan in-depth analysis, we then evaluate the accu-\nracy and Exe_Rate across different rounds of self-\nrefinement on FOLIO, namely, 0 (no refinement),\n1, 2, and 3 rounds. The results are in Figure 4.\nWe find that as the rounds of self-refinement in-\ncrease, the percentage of executable formulations\nconsistently increases, leading to an enhancement\nin the final performance. This suggests that self-\nrefinement serves as an effective tool in aiding the\nLLM to accurately frame the problem. However,\nthe accuracy tends to stagnate in subsequent rounds,\neven though the Exe_Rate continues to increase.\nThis can be attributed to the type of feedback re-\nceived by the self-refiner, which is the error mes-\n3813\nProblem:\"Stranger Things\" is a popular Netflix show.

This feedback aids\nin converting “invalid” symbolic representations\ninto valid ones. However, a valid symbolic repre-\nsentation does not necessarily equate to a “correct”\nproblem formulation that accurately represents the\nproblem. This issue could be tackled by enhanc-\ning the self-refiner to incorporate feedback beyond\nthe error message, e.g., a reward signal from an\nadditional module evaluating the accuracy of a gen-\nerated symbolic form. We leave this as a promising\ndirection for future exploration.\n4.5 Case Study\nIn Figure 5, we show an example of the symbolic\nrepresentations generated by GPT-4, together with\nthe predicted answer. In general, LOGIC -LM has\ndemonstrated a potent capacity to interpret com-\nplex problems into symbolic forms. Nonetheless,\nthere remain certain difficulties in accurately un-\nderstanding the semantics of the problem.\nWe further analyze some error cases in Fig-\nure 6 of Appendix E. Example 1 shows a case\nwhere GPT-4 generates an incorrect FOL represen-\ntation, stemming from its inability to define ap-\npropriate predicates. Here, instead of creating the\npredicate EasternWildTurkey, the model gener-\nates a constant, WildTurkey(eastern), in which\nWildTurkey is the predicate and eastern is the\nconstant. While this representation is valid in iso-\nlation, it does not interact well with subsequent\nconstants. This inconsistency is a recurring issue\nin GPT-4’s symbolic form generation, illustrating\nthat the model sometimes struggles to maintain an\noverarching understanding of the problem when\nforming logical symbols. Example 3 highlights a\ncase where GPT-4 struggles to interpret specific\nexpressions accurately. In this case, the model fails\nto distinguish between the meanings of “below”\nand “above”, resulting in an incorrect constraint\nDan > Eve. Example 4 exemplifies GPT-4’s chal-\nlenge with fully grasping the rules of FOL gram-\nmar, evidenced by the invalid generated formula:\nRating(subway, y) ∧y > 9. These error cases\nunderscore that transforming problems into logi-\ncal forms remains a challenging task for modern\nLLMs, due to the intricacies of FOL formulation,\nthe innate flexibility of natural language, and the\ncomplexity of global problem comprehension.\n5 Conclusion and Future Work\nIn this work, we propose a novel approach to ad-\ndress logical reasoning problems by combining\nlarge language models with symbolic solvers. We\nintroduce Logic-LM, one instantiation of such a\nframework, and demonstrate how it significantly\nimproves performance over pure LLMs and chain-\nof-thought prompting techniques.\nWhile Logic-LM has proven to be a capable sys-\ntem, it can be further improved with extension to\nmore flexible and powerful logic systems. For ex-\nample, statistical relational learning (SRL) systems\nsuch as Markov logic networks (Richardson and\nDomingos, 2006) and probabilistic soft logic (Bach\net al., 2017) have demonstrated great promise in\nreasoning under uncertainty and integration with\nour framework would enable even more adaptive\nproblem-solving capabilities. Additionally, our\nmethod can be extended to reasoning problems\nrequiring commonsense, which remains a signifi-\ncant challenge as they often require reasoning over\ncomplex and ambiguous rules.\n3814\nLimitations\nWe identify two main limitations of LOGIC -LM .\nFirst, LOGIC -LM relies on translating reasoning\nproblems into logical formats that can be tackled by\nsymbolic solvers. As a consequence, the model’s\napplicability is inherently bounded by the expres-\nsiveness of the symbolic solver, for example, not all\nproblems can be easily encoded in first-order logic.\nNevertheless, this limitation can be mitigated by\nintegrating a more diverse set of symbolic solvers.\nThe flexible design of LOGIC -LM facilitates this\nintegration. The wide range of reasoning tasks that\nwe can instantiate our LOGIC -LM framework on\nshows its general applicability.\nSecond, LOGIC -LM depends on in-context\nlearning coupled with self-refinement to convert\na natural language (NL) problem into the symbolic\nrepresentation. While this method has proven to\nbe effective, it may face difficulties when dealing\nwith logical representations with intricate grammar\nstructures, such as probabilistic soft logic. This\narises from the difficulty in conveying complex\ngrammatical rules to the language model through\na limited number of demonstrations within a con-\nstrained context size. As a potential solution, future\nworks could explore the development of specialized\nmodules to enhance the mapping between NL and\nsymbolic language, e.g., fine-tuning LLMs with\nsynthetic data generated via symbolic solvers.\nEthics Statement\nThe use of large language models requires a signifi-\ncant amount of energy for computation for training,\nwhich contributes to global warming (Strubell et al.,\n2019). Our work performs few-shot in-context\nlearning instead of training models from scratch, so\nthe energy footprint of our work is less. The large\nlanguage models whose API we use for inference,\nespecially GPT-4, consume significant energy.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Science\nFoundation Award #2048122.
