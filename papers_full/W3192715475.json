INTRODUCTION\nAbout 75% of technical and scientific data can be location in patent documents alone as the research done by the \nPatent Office of Europe. Patents provide a unique source of data since they can be published, screened and collected \nbased on globally acknowledged standards. Apart from being a major source of technological intelligence, these \ndocuments provide competitive intelligence to businesses by defining the strategies, strengths and weaknesses of \nbusinesses. Information attained from patents can also aid in identifying the partners for collaboration and licensing. \nSince the patent system has been created, approximately 55 million patent application can been documented. It can \nbe challenging to identify and evaluate critical documents in a manual format [1]. The necessity to evaluate and \nanalyze patent tools has been accepted by wide-range remedies from producers. Novel remedies are still being \nrecommended into the market, and include the tools for assessing individual tools, reading patent data and \nevaluating a collection of patent documents. Remedies for evaluating a collection of patent documents can be \nclassified into two: Tools meant to retrieve and prepare basic statistical data for patent documents; and the Tools \nmeant to visualize and progressively evaluate patents. The former handles data in a structured manner, whereby the \nlatter evaluates unstructured information.  \nThis paper evaluate, four tools for evaluating patent documents have been analyzed and tested. These include \nAnaVist, OmniViz, Thomson and Eureka. The tools evaluate both unstructured and structured data. They also \nvisualize the findings attained from  all the clustered data fields from the patent document and project basis \nstatistical graphs and incorporate the filters meant to perform particular remedies. These tools have been tested with \nrespect to two fundamental cases, assessing their capacities to provide business technology and intelligence from the \npatent documents for businesses on a daily basis. The knowledge of enhanced techniques and forestall of products \noverlap the Research and Development (R&D) projects and hence prevents unessential investments. Of equally \nsignificance is the identification of essential actors that operate in the same technological field. Assessing and \nbenchmarking the competitors in business is a market and R&D approach, which helps in the management of \nprocesses and identification of parties for cross licensing and collaboration.  \nThis contribution focusses on the perspective of a patent expert with the competent understanding of patent \ninformation but no particular competency of data mining methods or tool testing. All these tools assessed and tested \nare critical for the tasks and efficient for the adoption of daily business works. All these tools have some weaknesses \nand strengths when compared to each other. In conclusion, it can be argued that Thomson and OmniViz tools for \nanalyzing data are for diversified and sophisticated mathematical evaluation of data. On the other hand, AnaVist and \nAureka are effective for modest visualization of statistical data and for creating patent maps that are stylish. Novel \nfeatures of OmniViz, if distinguished with other tools, are possible in the visualization of clustered information from \nwide-range perspectives and possibilities to assess some attributes based on patent animated maps [2]. Thomson \nISSN: 2789–181X                                                                  Journal of Computing and Natural Science 1(2)(2021) \n \n58 \n \nprovides effective tools for distinguishing various sets of data, such as identifying novel values of attributes. Aureka \nis a tool that permits citation evaluation and incorporate illustrative patent maps. AnaVist is considered the best in \nretrieving basis statistical data quickly and efficiently.  \nThe results retrieved with all these tools are similar, despite the fact that various databases for data retrieval were \nutilized. Top investors and assignees lists were similar, since this was a yearly trend and both geographical and \ntechnological business segments reported the same results. Patent documents in reciprocal order were varied. \nNonetheless, the conclusion gotten from the findings, and decision-making process by businesses would be the \nsame irrespective of the tools utilized. This Section I has introduced the four tools: Thomson, Aureka, and AnaVist, \nOmniViz. The remaining section further evaluates the tools, patent documents, and their significance to business \nintelligence and technology. In that case, the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows:  Section II \nprovides a brief analysis of the research. Section III provides a study analysis. Section IV results for the research. \nSection V concludes the paper.  \nII. BRIEF OVERVIEW  \nBusiness Intelligence and Technology for the Patent Documents  \nThe patent scheme is based on the protocol that to attain the aspect of monopoly, innovation need to be \ncomprehensive with upmost accuracy for individuals that are skilled in a specific art to enhance implementation. \nTypically, patent application incorporate 18 months following the filing scheme and are presentable for anyone \ntypically in an electronic manner. The significance of patent information as a technological source and business \nintelligence has been accepted for many decades now. Researchers have differentiated four major types of technical \ndata carriers: processes/products, people, technical publications and patents. In the research, it is argued that, in the \ncontext of patent data, irrespective of comprehensive inadequacies, it can be considered as a novel source of \ntechnical data. It is gathered, analyzed and published based on standardized protocols. It progressively generates an \nevaluation of sophisticated measure of metrical technological transformation. It also allows transparent \naccumulation of competencies on an international scale.  \nBased on the comments evaluated above, patent data is fundamental for R&D and business intelligence, oven \nfor industries without the projections to utilize patent for various tasks. Evaluations of patent documents show the \ncurrent sophistication, including helping in identifying white spaces and technological fields that lack innovation. \nBecause of the need to disclose an invention, the creation of patented methods and products can be evaluated in \ntheir entirety and this might be challenging. Annual trends in R&D may be identified by evaluating annual data in \npatent documents. Emphases on R&D also vary based on geographical regions that might be evaluated through \npatent information.  \nAnnual trends in patenting represent the current hot segment, which are the areas with multiple inventions and \ntechnological segments that are declining. Evaluations for technological intelligence have to be completed by \nprofessionals in the technological segment to attain maximum profits and benefits. The patent documents also \nprovide business intelligence meant to support the firm’s business decisions [3]. The knowledge of other firm’s \npatent portfolios provide critical data on the rivals and aids in the allocation of potential competitors for licensing \ntechnologies and collaborations, which includes the identification of novel entrants in the present market. \nIdentifying another firm’s or rival’s patent activities identifies its strategies and business trends.  \nAnnual tends indicate critical technological segments that have been abandoned by the firm and the segment it is \nfocusing on at the present. Application activities for various patent firms, in every country’s patent office, reveal a \nfirm’s geographical business approach. It is however considered that some data is always confidential to firms. To \nreceive patent, innovation should be novel and essential requirements have to be considered as well. This shows that \npatent application should be the first place when inventions are disclosed. This provides a significant possibility of \nidentifying novel techniques and product before they are seen in the market. The evaluation of patent investors and \nassignees identifies collaboration between different actors and provide essential data that facilitates recruiting.  \nPatent Data  \nData from patent documents includes both unstructured and structure formats. In most patent documents, the first \npage normally includes bibliographic information that is structured and the abstract and title that are unstructured. \nThe document also includes a definition of claims, which is an illustration of legal protection for patents, inventions \nand essential drawings. Publication and numbering practices vary significantly between various patent firms [4]. \nThe major attribute utilize for the evaluation; nonetheless, identified in all patent documents, are standardized in \nsome form by various database distributors. \nThe various fields in patent documents are illustrated using global numbering system. The implication of these \nfields utilize in the analysis have been evaluated in upcoming sections of this paper. Patent documents integrate the \nidentification of numbers. Priority information integrates the priority numbers that have been assigned for the first \napplication applicable for patents, which also integrates the corresponding dates. The number of publication is \nprovided to a document during the period of publication i.e. eighteen months following its filing. The date of \npublication denotes to the corresponding dates. The date of issue represents the dates granted to the patent and this \nis typically three to five years after filing.  \nHowever, this depends on the patent departmental office. The patent applicants or assignees are the individuals \nand organizations that hold the rights for application and invention for patents. Inventions structured in \ncollaborations are allocated to the various parties involved. The investors include the research developing the \ninventions. Inventions have been categorized based on technologies attached to them. One of the most commonly \nISSN: 2789–181X                                                                  Journal of Computing and Natural Science 1(2)(2021) \n \n59 \n \nutilized is the International Patent Classification, 51 (IPC International Patent Classification) – 51) [5]. Most of the \npatent firms have formed custom categorization systems such as the USA patent classification. A number of \ndatabase producers have also formed individual categorization system to create analyses and searches of essential \ndocument easily.  \nIn this research, two of these categorizations have been utilized and provided by Thomson; these are Derwentis \nmanual code and Derwent categorization. The abstract (57) and title (54) signify the illustrations of inventions of the \nnatural languages. These represent the unstructured data and its informative format of it varies significantly based \non the author.  \nIII. STUDY ANALYSIS  \nThe general number of patent documents that have been published is 60,000,000 and this incorporates the \napplications that never produced patent. It might be challenging to identify and evaluate all the essential patents \nwithout automatic application [6]. The necessity for evaluation and analysis of the patent tools has been accepted by \nmost of remedy providers. Novel remedies are being considered into the market; the tools used for reading and \nassessing each patent e.g. PatBase, STN-Viewer, ScioSphere, and the tools for evaluating multiple patents. \nRemedies of the former type can be grouped into two segments: tools meant to retrieve and create basic statistics for \npatents e.g. Patbase, Qpat and Lexis Nexis, and the tools meant to visualize and progressively evaluate patents. The \nlatter type handles unstructured data type while the former also evaluates unstructured data [7]. The former one has \nbeen focused in this contribution.  \nThis research was done based on the perspective of patent analysts. The analysts, as focused in this paper, \nprovide business data and technology for businesses and R&D departments. This research focused on clarifying the \ntype of assistance the established remedies provide for normal works of analysts. Four remedies significant utilized \nby patent evaluations have been tested. These tools included AnaVist. Thomson, Aureka and OmniViz. This paper \npresents an observation made during the process of testing and presents the findings of two testing instances. In this \nsection, the study framework and set of data utilized have been defined.  \nData Mining  \nThe application of terminologies in literature relating to the evaluation and processing of patent-based information \ncan be confusing. Data mining, visualization, text mining, and patent mining all relate and are the terms used when \nexplain documents processing. In this section, we will focus on providing the definition of terms and provide an \nexplanation as to why data mining was selected as the theme topic of this research.  \nJ. Bacardit and X. Llorà in [8] have defined the terminology data mining as the evaluation of massive observable \ndata meant to identify unspeculated connections and make a summary of information in a comprehensive and \nfundamental manner to the analysts. The researchers have defined text mining as the skill-intensive procedure for \nuser interaction with documents and the collection process based on the application of analysis tools. In a way \nanalogous to the process of data mining, text mining focusses on the extraction of critical data from the various \nsources of information through the exploration and identification of the best patterns. For text mining, the sources of \ndata are information collection, where patterns are identified in the standardized databases but in an unstructured \nform.  \nR. Pérez-Castillo, D. Caivano and M. Piattini in [9] defined the clustering process that categorizes different \nobjects into different classes. This is executed through the categorization of different objects. The variation between \ncategorization and clustering is that in categorization, issues are presented based on the collection of pre-categorized \ntraining samples and system tasks is obliged to master the definition of different categories for it to be capable of \nclassifying novel objects that have not been labelled. As for clustering, the issue is to classify particular unlabeled \ncollections into comprehensive clusters without any data submitted in prior. Any individual labels that are linked to \nparticular objects are retrieved from the information.  \nResearchers  in [10] defined the terminology patent data as the processing of information to process patent \ndocuments. The ideology is to visualize information and how it is explored. Visualization is based on the \npresentation of information is a visual manner, which allows individuals to get significant insight into information, \ncreate conclusions, and interact with information. The enhancement of visualization methods over the past few \ndecades has been fulfilled to enhance visualization of data that is of low dimension, and this incorporates making \nhistograms a significant attribute of data and to formulate novel visualization of high-degree textual data. The patent \ndocuments include both unstructured and structured data, which are semi-structured. Bibliographic data of patents is \nstructured and is based on a significantly strict format. For instance, it incorporate the assignees of the patents and \nthe names of the inventors, various identifiers e.g. number of publication and priority, categorization and years.  \nH. XIE and X. CHEN in [11] focused on unstructured data as text illustrating the inventions and the dimension \nof protecting patents such as claims, abstracts and titles. According to the researchers, result visualization of patent \nevaluation is identified as patent graphing whenever it has been structured from structured information, and patent \nmap for unstructured data.  \nNonetheless, H. Han and C. Zhang in [12] admit that, the terminology map has been utilized in typically all the \ncases. The four tools evaluated and tested analyzed both the unstructured and structured data, and the results of \nvisualization of all the classifications. Visualization is possible for both the high-degree and low-degree data e.g. the \npie and bar graphing for patent landscape and structured sets of data i.e. mappings for the unstructured sets of data. \nAn evaluation of textual information is done based on the first categorization and it is based on frequent texts.  \nISSN: 2789–181X                                                                  Journal of Computing and Natural Science 1(2)(2021) \n \n60 \n \nIn this paper, the terminology data mining is utilize as an upper level terminology for all the activities that \nhandle massive amounts of data. Text mining on the other hand denotes to the evaluation of unstructured data.  \nTesting Case Analysis  \nIn this paper, tools have been tested based on two critical cases, assessing their capacities to provide business \nintelligence and technology from different patent documents for firms on a daily basis. Being versed with the latest \ntechnological segments is fundamental for firms and this is a critical process of innovation. The skillset of \ndeveloped technologies and product forestall that overlap R&D efforts prevents unessential investments. Similarly, \nother essential actors operate in the same field. Evaluating and benchmarking competitors is a market and R&D \napproach that helps in the management of processes and identifying potential parties that are used in cross-licensing \nand collaboration.  \nThis analysis based on the perspective of patent analysts with the better comprehension of patent information \nbut do not have particular skills on methods of data mining or testing of tools. Moreover, to assess the findings on \nthe study and the value for business intelligence and technology, their application rate was compared based on \nparticular questions: \n Are the tools easy to use? \n Do the tools require the users to read manuals before focusing on the evaluation? \n What forms of information formats are supported by the tools? \n Are there any reasons for manipulating information and can they be evaluated by the tools?  \n Can research be enhanced using the tools; focusing on the findings by eliminating the texts, which have \nbeen included due to extensive search profiles?  \n1st Case Analysis: Technological-centered information: The first case analysis assessed the tools with the \ntechnology-centered information. The patent texts are the most accurate and comprehensive source of \ntechnological-based data. In reference to D. Gagliardi in [13], approximately 75% of technological data can be \nidentified from these patent texts. in the advent of temporary monopolies of inventions, investors are required to \ndisclose this in enough and satisfactory details. The 1st case evaluated the patent texts that handle technological \napplication for evaluating friction between road surfaces and motors. Any potential restrictions by the time of the \npatent tests were not incorporated. The profile of search was structured based on the restricted searches of the \nessential texts into a single IPC category i.e. to measure and test. Therefore, the patent texts includes works such as \nroad, vehicle, friction and conditions, including the various synonyms related to them.  \nIn the study, particular answers to the following queries were provided:  \n What are the patent trends in the technological areas at the present?  \n How potential is it to evaluate particular groups of technology?  \n How can invention be done with a particular firm where X is related to the Y firm’s invention?  \n Can it be easier to locate particular documents from multiple patent texts?  \n2nd Case Analysis: Firm-Based Information: The 2nd case assessed the portfolio of the patent of a particular firm. \nIdentifying another competitor or firm patenting an activity can reveal its business strategies and business strengths. \nAnnual trends indicate the technological segments the firm has eliminated and identifies the segments being focused \non at the present. Applying the various activities to various patent firms, ie, various nations and offices reveals a \nfirm’s geographic organizational strategies. Patent evaluation provide a significant possibility that reveal novel \ntechniques and products before their arrival in the market. The evaluation of patent inventors and assignees reveal \nthe available collaborations between different actors and provide data for head-hunting. In the 2nd case analysis, \nFraunhofer Gesselschaft was selected. The firm is based in Europe as the largest company applicable for this \nresearch. The company filed its applications and patents from 1995.  \nThis 2nd case focusses on analyzing how various queries can be answered using different tools. These queries \ninclude:  \n What are the specific technologies a firm can focus on?  \n How has its level of concentration transformed the company for the last decade?  \n What is the regional segment that the company operates in?  \n What forms of cooperation has been established by the company?  \n \nDatasets and Databases in Testing  \nThe different sets of data were retrieved from four various databases commercially used: PCT Full, USPat Full, \nDWPI, and Micro Patent, and three various sets of data were created. The dataset content is formed with the same \nprofile. An integration of PCT Full, USPat Full and DWPI information was applied in the tests of AnaVist. The \nDWPI information was utilized to test OmniViz and Aureka. The application of these tools in actual life is limited \nbased on the application of various datasets and databases. Aureka utilizes Micro Patent and AnaVist makes use of \nfour various databases. Thomson evaluates information from various sources; however, it is based on particular \nfilters meant to handle DWPI information.  \nOmniViz makes utse of information in a different format and provides wizards that import information in Excel \nformat in Microsoft, which explains why Micro Patent information was utilized to assess it. The evaluation was \ndone out based on the application of bibliographic, abstract and title data of the texts. Micro Patent represent the \nPatent Web, which is an internet repository that is created by Thomson. It incorporates more than 50,000,000 texts \nISSN: 2789–181X                                                                  Journal of Computing and Natural Science 1(2)(2021) \n \n61 \n \nand records of the front page. The Patent Web incorporate the documents retrieved from 6 different patent firms and \nPCT: complete documents from patent and trademarks offices in the U.S.; and the patent office in Europe.  \nDWPI represents the databases created by Thomson. It is known for its value addition that implies to the patent \ntexts that wrote abstracts and documents in English for the purposes of being standardized and informative. The \ndatabase has patent texts from more than 38 authorities globally. Information from different members of the patents \nhas been integrated into a single document. These documents are integrated in the DWPI categorization. The codes \nand manuals are meant to enhance the search for the documents. US Patfull represents the databases from the patent \nand trademark offices in United States. It incorporates the complete documents from the offices from 1971. US \nPatfull integrates the complete tests of the patent cooperation treaty, which publishes applications the globes \nintellectual properties since the late 1970s.  \nDue to the fact that information incorporates two various cases and three different databases, this amounted to a \ntotal of 6 sets of data. All these sets incorporate patent applications and patent tests. Micro Patent information was \nsaved on a excel file in Microsoft.  \nSearches have been restricted to the texts categorized into IPC category: ‘to measure and test’. Texts had to \nincorporate a single word: Car or vehicle, and automotive, include the following combinations:  \n Friction or skid (5N)  \n Highways or roads  \n Roadways or freeways (condition)  \n Roads, freeways or highways (condition) \nThese searches created more than 649 tests from the Micro Patent and 1080 from the DWPI databases. In STN, \ntests from DWPI were combined with the texts that have been taken from US Patfull and PCT full. These texts were \nevaluated through the limitations of fields for claims, abstracts and titles to create a more accurate search. This \namounted to 1340 tests. For the firm-based data, the searches have been restricted to the applications and patent \ndocuments filed after the early 1990s. These searches produced more than 4500 texts from the DWPI databases and \n4625 texts from Micro Patent. The variation in figures is because of the few days that elapsed.  \nAnalysis with Tools  \nThe wide-range tools and remedies for evaluating patents and the novel ones are gradually being presented into the \nmarket. These are tools for evaluating and reading individual tools and patents for evaluating different patent texts. \nRemedies can be grouped into two segments: tools for preparing and retrieving statistical data for patent texts; and \nthe tools used to visualize and evaluate patents. The former category handles information in an unstructured \nmanner, whereby the latter evaluates both the unstructured data and other sets of data.  \nThe tools used in the analysis were tested and presented by past researchers. In this research, tools have been \ntested with two actual-life cases to study how they effectively fit to their actual cases available in a firm in its \nnormal business operations. The main purpose of this research was to assess the manner in which tools are to utilize \nand how applicable and informative these analyses are. The research considered the two instances, one with \ntechnological-based information while the other is a firm’s portfolio for patents.  \nSection IV below focusses on the results and remarks of the evaluation done by the technological-based data, \nwhile Section V focuses on the firm-based data. The section will present data on the tools and the relative \nobservations concerning their applicability. The tools included the processes meant for clustering unstructured data, \nin this instance, abstracts and titles for patent tests and to visualize different clusters. They also created tools meant \nto retrieve basis data on various attributes identified in different sets of data. Tools that have been test might be \nclassified into two classes. The first class incorporates Anavist and Aureka that are efficient and easier to utilize and \nprovide basic analyses with minimal efforts and evaluations requires by an individual.  \nThe available data is limited to minimal patent databases: Aureka utilizes data that has been retrieved from the \nMicro Patent databases, while AnaVist from the four various databases for patents. Alongside the highly applicable \ninterfaces, the efficiency of application is based on the restrictions of individuals from affecting the strategies and \nalgorithms utilize in dealing with data. The tools in the other class, TDA-Vantage-Point and OmniViz represent \nthose tools that empower statistical evaluations done on different forms of data. The application of the tools \nnecessitates some degree of study.  \nBecause of the possibilities of assessing data from unrestricted sources, a number of preparations before \nfocusing on analyses is required. Tools generate wizards and filters to aid in the importation of information. Various \nanalyses provided by the tools are efficient to render through the application of more default values. Due to the \ninfluence of the users, there are various potentials for selections e.g. clustered algorithms. A preparation of enough \nsearch profiles, mostly in creating technological-based patent texts, is normally challenging. Searchers has to \nidentify the potential balance between eliminating some essential tests and incorporating essential ones. The \napplicability of the evaluation, nonetheless, is based on the data validity. All these tools tested allow the redefinition \nof information by creating subsets of them and handling they as new analyses. Data visualization is made easier \nthrough the location of documents, which were no related to subjects and eliminate them.  \n \nAureka  \nAureka is a Thomson tools used to evaluate and visualize patent information and sharing it within the firm. The \nmost effective element of Micro Patent includes the representation visualization, interface and basic statistics. The \ntool is incorporated for the Micro Patent database. The tool is more flexible and permits modification and \nbroadening of sets of data even in the midst of evaluations, irrespective of the fact that it limits some evaluation to \nISSN: 2789–181X                                                                  Journal of Computing and Natural Science 1(2)(2021) \n \n62 \n \njust the complete patent document from some global patent offices. Operating with the tool require minimal \npreparations of information of tool learning. The tool focusses on the sharing of data within the firm and \nsignification of findings of analyses. Statistics might be visualized with custom reports or data transfer to the excel \nfile. The tool do not provide more interactivity at that level as other tools have been tested; however, patent texts \nmay be identified from visualizations and comprehensive application.  \n \nOmniViz  \nThis tool is Bio-wisdom and utilized as a significantly powerful tools for data mining. It has been creased \nsignificantly for evaluating biological information and data. However, it is created for handling patent texts from \nother fields of technology also. The most effective element of the tool is its efficiency, interactivity, flexibility and \nsupply of various visualization methods. The tool is a significant for users familiar with the algorithms and methods \nof data mining. Whereas preparing information, users can select, for instance, the algorithms and stop texts utilized \nfor clustering e.g. Hierarchical and K-means. The tools has been created to be easy to utilize using default figures \nand has been suited for creating typical statistics and visualization for patent texts.  \nOmniViz focusses on visual representation and evaluations of patent information. There are eight various forms \nof visualization for handling various data perspectives, searching for clusters created from them, terms associated, \nand the connections between special visualization and numerical elements for network connection in biological \ntexts. Different data formats can be formed using the tool. It provides the filters for data importation and for has no \nlimits for capable individuals. Information utilized in evaluation might be interlinked with various sets of data, such \nas publications and patents. Due to the data format being non-predetermined, it require a number of prior \npreparations before the process of clustering.  \nCleansing of information may be created before the process of clustering through the edit of auxiliary file or \nutilizing the tool. The tool concentrates on the visual evaluation and more complex for creating basis statistics. The \ntool provides high-dimensionality of interactivity in the wide-range tools that are utilized in data analysis. The \nprocess of selection in a single tool significantly influences different aspects in the workplaces. It is potential to \nvisualize animations of categorical and numerical information such as annual patent filling and any related records \nin a visualization.  \n \nAnaVist  \nAnaVist is a tool created by the Chemical Society of America to enhance and facilitate flexible analyses during the \nprocess of retrieving data from the STN information bank. The most effective element of the tool is its \nrepresentative visualization, seamless connection within various analyses, preparation of different statistics \neffectively and an interface that is friendly to users. The tool evaluates information that has been accessed from 4 \nSTN databases. Two of these databases are complete data patent databases i.e. PCT Full and US PatFull, and two \nare based on value addition databases i.e. CA Plus and DWPI that integrate the scientific and patent references for \nbiochemistry and chemistry. In 2008, the amount of databases were boosted by one, during which the EP Full \ndatabase incorporating the complete data and patent texts in Europe were filed in the late 1970s.  \nData can be imported with ease from STN and transferred to enhance advance processing. On the contrary, it is \nrestricted to the patents in various fields compared to biochemistry and chemistry. Formulating visualization of data \nusing the tool is prompt that the preparation of statistics from various perspectives. AnaVist has an incredible \ndimension of interactivity between various forms of analyses.  \n \nThomson  \nThe tool is created by the Thomson Reuters that utilizes search technologies of the VantagePoint software for data \nmining and analysis. The most effective element of the tool is its efficiency and flexibility, including its macros for \nformulating various tools and reports that compare various segments created by data. Thomson evaluates \ninformation in almost every format. It further generates filters that aid in the importation process, and critical tools \nutilized in processing and handling information from DWPI. The tool focusses on data processing and integrates the \nmost basic forms of visualization despite including sophisticated calculations for backup. It provides various forms \nof tools for data analysis, matrices, and lists for modest statistics and the maps meant to assess the connection \nbetween clustered data and terminologies.  \nThe Thomson analyzer tool also permits individuals to effectively reveal different data records, which are the \nsame or the assignees with similar texts i.e. patent application that have been documented based on collaborations. \nThese approaches are significant for the identification of statistical divergences from information i.e. identifying the \ntechnological segment, which are mostly patented, critical segments and firms, which are active in most \ntechnological areas. The tool provides three various forms of reports that are predefined. These reports incorporate \nmodest and processed data concerning the subject matter. They are filed in an Excel file format and incorporate \ngraphs and tables. Reports might not be updated or upgraded. The three forms of reports include firm reports, for \naccessing data on a specific firm, Firm comparison reports used to compare 2 to 5 firms and Technological reports \nthat include different metrics concerning the areas of technology.  \n \nISSN: 2789–181X                                                                  Journal of Computing and Natural Science 1(2)(2021) \n \n63 \n \nIV. RESULTS  \nThe tools of analysis were evaluated and tested based two critical cases. This section focusses on the findings of \nthe evaluations with technological-based information. Some of the data have been eliminated due to their similarity \nin findings to the ones in other Sections. Various specialized inventions patented and individual frequencies in \ninformation may be assessed through the cluster of terms that appear in the patent texts. In this paper, abstracts and \ntitles have been utilized for the process of cluster. Tools have been used to visualize the findings by mapping \nclusters and documents in equal proportion to each other, i.e. formulating maps for patents. The texts with the same \nsubjects were in the same place in those maps. As a result, it is easier to identify the most sophisticate segment of \ninvention. It also indicates the data outliers, texts, which do not relate that much with the subjects.  \nThe tools evaluated and tested allow closer analysis of custom clusters and documents. Some modest statistical \nevaluations were done on information to gain effective comprehension. Answers to the queries: When did? What \ndid? and Who did? provide an overall idea about the subject. These queries were responded to by investigating the \npatent inventors and assignees, priority year and the various categorization provided for the document.  \nAureka representation was identified to be the most illustrative and clearest. The document frequencies have \ncolors and lines of contours. Each document is signified by dots. Three of the most essential terms in the cluster \ndifferentiate the documents from other tests. The top most frequency of the text was of the methods that relate to the \nmotor breaks, which has been illustrated using words systems, braking force, and brake in the process of \nvisualization. Fig 1 represents the statistics from Aureka data. Aureka provides two fundamental tools used in the \nretrieval of data; predefined filters and reports for exportation of data to excel. The reports that are predefined are \nprovided for all the wide-range elements in data. Reports are difficult to edit and this is normally require for \nattracting data into displayable manner.  \n \nFig 1: Aureka - Evaluation of patents that relate to the evaluation of road surfaces and friction \n05101520253035\nKey Assignees\nAssignees\n  \nFig 2: Number of years against Annual trends in filling up to 2006 \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nYear\n  \nTable 1: IPC for the patents \n \nIP CATEGORY  Text Count % \nB60-T000-8172 16 7.2 \nB60-R000-1602 12 6.4 \nG01-N00-1902 11 4.9 \nB60-T000-858 11 4.5 \nISSN: 2789–181X                                                                  Journal of Computing and Natural Science 1(2)(2021) \n \n64 \n \nG01-B00-1130 8 4.5 \nB60-G000-170165 7 3.4\nB60-G000-2300 5 3.0 \nB62-D000-0600 5 2.3 \nG01-M00-1700 5 2.2 \nB62-D000-0601 18 2.2 \n  \nOccurrence of the 10 best patent \ncategories  \n98 41 \nThe remaining IPC 155 60 \nOverall primary IPC 265  \nApplication No. 189  \nPatent No. 75  \n \nBecause of this, the tool provides tools used to import information to excel and the macros used to creating \neffective statistical presentation. The top most assignees for the patents and the document amounts filed relate to the \ntechnological application in question and this is represented in the Fig 1 above. Mazda, Nissan and Toyota are three \nof the most active firms that patent in this field and handle with the invention that relate to roads. Annual trends in \nfiling are indicated in Fig 2. Patent activities varied significantly until 2006, and this seemed to have diminished \nsignificantly. Table 1 indicate the global patent categorization provided by patent firms. The data indicates a \ndivision of various technology for various documents compared to what clustering does. IPC in the reports that have \nbeen predefined are non-informative since they are based on the statistics by excel and Aureka’s macros. \nFig 3 represents the visualization of datasets from various points-of-view created by OmniViz. The same way, in \nthe texts visualized from the graphics on the left side, galaxy visualizations have been engaged. The tool \nincorporates the documents in a cluster form that are close to one another. Every document incorporates the squares \nand dots that represent cluster centroid. All these clusters represent three frequent terminologies; however, they \nhave been centered on a few images that are clear. Graphics included in the right side have been created using \nThemeMap visualizations. This indicate similar patent landscapes; however, they are visualized from a different \nangle. It is thus more effective to evaluate the document amounts in every cluster.  \nGraphics can also be zoomed or rotated in OmniViz to visualize them from the various directions. The clusters \nwith the terminologies friction, surface and wheel has high frequencies close to one another at the top most segment \nof the representation. In this case, three clusters are included at the bottom, are separated, and have minimal texts. \nThere are possibility that they do not relate to the subject. A close evaluation of the clusters was done. This \nevaluation revealed that they assess the methods of navigation, not assessing the relative conditions of road surfaces, \nbut outliers. The evaluation was done using data by eliminating them out to retrieve the most accurate set of data for \nthe purpose of the assessment.  \n \n  \nFig 3: OmniViz visualizations of patents that related to evaluation of road surface friction by dual visualizations \n(ThemeMap – right and Galaxy – right). \n \nISSN: 2789–181X                                                                  Journal of Computing and Natural Science 1(2)(2021) \n \n65 \n \nFig 4 indicates the modest data from OmniViz.

The \napplications of patent have been categorized to illustrate the technological concentration. IPC represents the global \ncategorization given by authorities of patents. A number of databases also maintain individual categorization to aid \nin the process of discovering essential patent texts. The most utilized category includes the technologies that relate \nto the measurement of friction and braking control. Derwent manual codes indicate significant comprehensive \ninventions, in the lead and these are inventions that relate to the measurement of friction on road surfaces.  \nIt can be summed up that the results obtained in this Section made by the various tools were the same. They \nprovided also similar top assignees to patents. Their order however, varied. Nissan and Toyota are considered as the \nmajor actors in the sector. The deviation was that Thomson analyzer missed out in the analyses. The annual trend \ngraphs indicated an enhanced patent since the early 1990s and 2000s and minor transformation to date.  \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, the data analyzer tools Thomson, OmniViz, AnaVist and Aureka have been applied and seen to be \napplicable for tasks in the business world. All these tools had their weaknesses and strengths compared on one \nanother. AnaVist and Aureka were seen to be easier to utilize and their evaluation can be considered in preliminary \ndata analysis activities. Aureka’s strength is seen in its visual representation of findings and clear interface for users. \nThe including of citation evaluation provide an added advantage to the evaluation. AnaVist is also credited for its \neasier user interface. The most efficient AnaVist feature include the potentials to visualize results of a particular \nanalysis with ease from various viewpoints at a higher dimension and time of tool interactivity.  \nDespite the fact that OmniViz, Thomson and VintagePoint require significant time of preparation and mastering \nbefore an evaluation can be executed, they normally tend to compensate for all the significant effort for providing \nISSN: 2789–181X                                                                  Journal of Computing and Natural Science 1(2)(2021) \n \n68 \n \nmore sophisticated evaluation and highly dimensional power of making decisions for the users. They are considered \nan effective tool for power users. However, they are useful and efficient for modest evaluations. The strength of the \ntools include the possibilities to utilize information from multiple sources and based on multiple formats and they \nalso provide filters to help in the process of importing data and enhancing the process of data collaboration in \nvarious formats.  \nVantagePoint has a significantly special tool that is skilled in dealing with value-added patent information from \nDWPI that is a significantly unique database for patent data. The OmniViz data analyzer tool has focused on \nenhancing various remedies for data visualization. The high-dimensionality of interaction provided, such as, \nanimation of annual trends is the best feature considered in this case. Both of these tools have various positive \nevaluating tools that have not been introduced in this research e.g. Thomson is considered as an auto correction \nmatrices and map used to assess any items that are related within a specific field while the OmniViz represents the \nanalysis of biological and numerical data. Limited presence of data sources includes AnaVist and Aureka \nweaknesses. Nonetheless, Aureka has limited this by permitting the data evaluated using Thomson and transferred \nfor the purposes of visualization. Resultantly, this boosts the value of Aureka, even though the application of Micro \nPatent data might minimize the overall scope of evaluation.  \nAnaVist provides 5 different databases for evaluating and formalizing two of them, which are value-added \ndatabases i.e. DWPI and Chemical Abstract Services. The Chemical abstract plus service incorporates the \nbibliographic information from scientific and patent publications in the field of biochemistry. The preparation \nrequire to provide chemical and chemistry engineering services is also included in this case. The major weaknesses \nof OmniViz include the modest statistical data and the requirement to comprehend the state-of-the-art statistical \ntechniques, such as, correlational matrices. The Thomson tool for data analysis had weaknesses such as \nvisualization stiffness. The major statistics are more effective to access; however, the formation of presentations \nwas challenging; for instance, record number restrictions. The model visualization formats minimized its clarity. In \ngeneral all the tools reported their possibilities to create segments for closer assessment of information. In addition, \nthey presented tools used to label cluster identifies and visualization attributes.  \n \nReferences \n[1]. S.
