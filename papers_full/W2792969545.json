    "abstract": "This work demonstrates an interface, Creative Help, that assists people with creative writing by automatically suggesting new sentences in a story. Authors can freely edit the generated suggestions, and the application tracks their modifications. We make use of a Recurrent Neural Network language model to generate suggestions in a simple probabilistic way. Motivated by the theorized role of unpredictability in creativity, we vary the degree of randomness in the probability distribution used to generate the sentences, and find that authors' interactions with the suggestions are influenced by this randomness.",
