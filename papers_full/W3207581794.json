    "abstract": "A mask-based lensless camera adopts a thin mask to optically encode the scene and records the encoded pattern on an image sensor. The lensless camera can be thinner, lighter and cheaper than the lensed camera. But additional computation is required to reconstruct an image from the encoded pattern. Considering that the significant application of the lensless camera could be inference, we propose to perform object recognition directly on the encoded pattern. Avoiding image reconstruction not only saves computational resources but also averts errors and artifacts in reconstruction. We theoretically analyze multiplexing property in mask-based lensless optics which maps local information in the scene to overlapping global information in the encoded pattern. To better extract global features, we propose a simplified Transformer-based architecture. This is the first time to study Transformer-based architecture for encoded pattern recognition in mask-based lensless optics. In the optical experiment, the proposed system achieves 91.47% accuracy on the Fashion MNIST and 96.64% ROC AUC on the cats-vs-dogs dataset. The feasibility of physical object recognition is also evaluated.",
