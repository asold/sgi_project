Age\nstandardised norms were estimated using 1130 normal\nchildren aged 0–6 years from a rural setting in Malawi.\nThe performance of each item in the tool was examined\nthrough goodness of fit on logistic regression, reliability\nand interpretability at a consensus meeting. The\ninstrument was revised with removal of items performing\npoorly.\nResults: An assessment tool with 138 items was\ncreated. Face, content and respondent validity was\ndemonstrated. At the consensus meeting, 97% (33/34) of\ngross motor items were retained in comparison to 51%\n(18/35) of social items, and 86% (69/80) of items from\nthe Denver II or Denver Developmental Screening Test\n(DDST) were retained in comparison to 69% (32/46) of\nthe newly created items, many of these having poor\nreliability and goodness of fit. Gender had an effect on\n23% (8/35) of the social items, which were removed.\nItems not attained by 6 years came entirely from the\nDenver II fine motor section (4/34). Overall, 110 of the\n138 items (80%) were retained in the revised instrument\nwith some items needing further modification.\nConclusions: When creating developmental tools for a\nrural African setting, many items from Western tools can\nbe adapted. The gross motor domain is more culturally\nadaptable, whereas social development is difficult to\nadapt and is culturally specific.\nEighty percent of the world’s disabled population\nlive in low income countries, many of these in\nAfrica.\n1 The World Health Organization has made\nearly identification of children with disabilities a\nhigh priority, especially as early rehabilitation may\nreduce the impact of impairments.\n23 To identify\nthese children and provide basic services, develop-\nmental milestones need to be clearly identified.\nFurthermore, clinical studies investigating inter-\nventions in children require normal parameters.\nWhen child development is assessed in clinical\nstudies in developing countries, Western develop-\nmental tools are often utilised.45 These include the\nBayley scales,6 the Griffith’s,7 the McCarthy scales8\nand the Denver II, 9 all designed and validated in\nWestern countries. These tools may be tailored for\nuse in non-Western settings. Often translation\n(changing of the language used) is all that is carried\nout.\n10 11 If this is not accompanied by a process of\nadaptation, translation alone may not allow\ncompletely for local expressions and customs,\ntherefore leading to misinterpretation of results. 12\nIn other settings, tools are adapted and items are\nmodified and in some cases new items are created\nfor use within a Western tool.\n13 Sometimes these\ntools are piloted (tried out before use) 14 and\nvalidated (assessed that they are measuring what\nthey are supposed to be measuring) in the local\npopulation.\n15 Even these adapted tools, however,\nare of limited value without normal ranges for\ntheir defined population. Standardisation studies\n(finding norms for a population) have taken place\nin many non-Western countries mainly using the\nDenver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) in a\ntranslated and occasionally adapted form,\n16–18 but\nnone of these studies was in Africa. Only two\nstudies have attempted standardisation in Africa,\none using a translated form of the Bayley scales\nwith an urban black South African population 19\nand the other on a limited age range in a rural\nNigerian population.\n20\nIt is clear that Western developmental assess-\nment tools may include tasks and materials which\nare completely alien to other cultures. These tools\nmay therefore fail to identify and assess children\nadequately in cultural settings other than those\nfor which they were created.\n21 This may be less of\na problem when comparing groups of children,\nbut when Western tools are used alone as an\noutcome measure, culture may have an effect. In\ntheoretical studies, culture has been demonstrated\nto have an influence on child development,\nparticularly in the area of social development.\n22–24\nCognitive abilities such as memory, categorisation\ntechniques and pattern recognition have also been\nreported to be influenced by culture.\n25–28 Even\ngross motor development may possibly be affected\nby culture.29–31\nIn this study, we aimed to create a simple,\nculturally appropriate developmental assessment\ntool adapted and modified from Western tools and\nstandardised for use in rural Malawi. The first\nstage in the development of this tool was to\nidentify which items from Western tools (eg, the\nDDST or Denver II) were not relevant to the age-\nappropriate experiences of rural Malawian chil-\ndren. These items were then replaced with ones\nmore appropriate to this cultural context. We did\nthis firstly by holding focus groups to agree which\nitems should be replaced and to create alternative\nitems. All items (both retained and new) were then\nvalidated and standardised in a large population\nstudy. The performance of all items was examined\nin a consensus meeting and a revised instrument\nproposed.\nOriginal article\nArch Dis Child 2008;93:23–29. doi:10.1136/adc.2006.095471 23\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on November 5, 2025 http://adc.bmj.com/Downloaded from 22 March 2007. 10.1136/adc.2006.095471 on Arch Dis Child: first published as \nMETHODS\nSetting and study population\nThis study was a substudy of the Lungwena Child Survival\nStudy (LCSS), a prospective family cohort study looking at\ngestational health and the growth, development, morbidity and\nmortality of rural Malawian infants and children. Lungwena is\nan area in southern Malawi where a government health centre\nserves an approximately 100 km\n2 rural area with some 17 000\npeople in 23 villages. Most of the inhabitants are Muslims of the\nYao tribe. The literacy rate is low and subsistence farming and\nfishing are the main occupations. The original cohort for the\nLCSS was enrolled between June 1995 and August 1996. All\npregnant women presenting for antenatal care were eligible for\nthe LCSS and 97% of the population of pregnant women in the\narea, at that time, were enrolled in the study. Details of\nrecruitment, collection of background data and follow-up have\nbeen described previously.\n32 33\nThe population of children used for this study is the original\nLCSS cohort of children aged 3.5–6.5 years and younger siblings\naged 0–3.5 years. Out of the 1237 LCSS children and siblings\navailable, 1197 were seen, with 40 families either refusing to\ntake part or not being available. The ages of the children were\nknown from LCSS birth data or from the ‘‘health passport’’\ngiven to mothers at the birth of their baby where the date of\nbirth is recorded and which almost all mothers carry with them\nfor all health appointments. A quota sampling strategy was\nused as in the DDST and Denver II\n34 with target numbers of\nchildren being sought in each of 33 age groups (see supplemen-\ntary table A). A total of 67 children were excluded due to\npremature birth (34 weeks or less measured by fundal height at\nthe antenatal clinic), 32 twin birth or significant disability\nincluding severe malnutrition (weight for height z score of less\nthan 22), leaving 1130 children in the final analysis.\nThe LCSS received approval from the National Health Science\nResearch Committee in Malawi (HSRC 93/94). Informed verbal\nconsent was sought from each mother at the beginning of the\nLCSS and again before a development assessment was carried out.\nCreation of the developmental assessment tool\nThe Denver II, DDST and Griffith’s instruments were examined\nby the Malawian research team. Items considered to be culturally\nappropriate were included and translated, whereas those con-\nsidered inappropriate (such as ‘‘prepares cereal’’ or ‘‘plays board/\ncard games’’) were removed. New items and modifications to\nFigure 1 The process of creating a more culturally appropriate developmental assessment tool.\nOriginal article\n24 Arch Dis Child 2008;93:23–29. doi:10.1136/adc.2006.095471\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on November 5, 2025 http://adc.bmj.com/Downloaded from 22 March 2007. 10.1136/adc.2006.095471 on Arch Dis Child: first published as \nWestern test items were then created through discussions with a\nseries of focus groups. Key informants were the eight local\nresearch workers. They were all women of child-bearing age with\nat least 8 year’s education and research experience of at least\n5 years. Themes relating to developmental milestones were\ndiscussed and ideas from these sessions were used to create new\nitems. Illustrations were made for most items in the instrument\nand used as prompts for the research workers. Some came with\npermission from Disabled village children.\n35\nFace validity 36 and content validity were assessed by all\nresearch assistants, five Malawian paediatricians, a language\nexpert from the University of Malawi and six medical students\nat the College of Medicine, Malawi. Once the new instrument\nwas created, the team was trained in its use and it was piloted\nin two stages. At each stage, feedback and training were given\nand problematic items were re-adapted or re-translated. The\nprocess of creating and refining the more culturally appropriate\ntool is shown in fig 1.\nStandardisation using a normal population sample\nOverall, 1197 children were assessed on one occasion between\nFebruary 2000 and April 2001 on a home visit by research\nassistants. The assessment took approximately 35 min to\ncomplete and where possible, items were directly observed. In\na few cases a report was given, for example ‘‘does he go to the\ntoilet by himself ?’’. Items were scored as either pass or fail, or\n‘‘don’t know’’ if the child was uncooperative or unwell. Items\nwere asked until the child failed seven items in a row.\nData entry and analysis were carried out using Microsoft\nExcel 6.0, SPSS 11.1, Stats-direct and STATA computer\nprograms. Each child in the study was identified by a code.\nData were checked prior to analysis and any outlying results\nwere reviewed.\nStandardisation is the process of determining normal age\nranges for which children pass the items for a developmental\nassessment tool. A logistic regression analysis was carried out\nwith decimal age and sex as explanatory variables. The observed\nand predicted probability of passing was determined and graphs\nwere drawn for each item. The goodness of fit of the graph was\nvisually assessed and discrepancies reviewed. To determine\nstatistically whether or not the fitted curve was a sufficiently\ngood representation of the data, a goodness of fit statistic was\ncalculated.\n37 If this was significant at the 5% level, indicating a\npoor fit, then the data were re-examined and refitting was done\nTable 1 Examples of specific items added or removed during the process of creating new more culturally appropriate tool\nDomain of\ndevelopment\nDDST or Denver II items\nremoved at stage 1\nNew items replaced\nat stage 1\nDenver II/Griffith’s items\nremoved or needing\nmodification after\nconsensus meeting\nNew items removed or needing\nmodification after consensus meeting\nGross motor 1.

The ages corresponding to the\n35th and 65th percentiles were calculated from the original fit to\ndetermine the cut-points. For some items that performed less\nwell, the cut-points were chosen by viewing the graphs to\nfacilitate a good fit. Three logistic curves were then fitted, one\nfor each region, based on the split.\n38 39 Any items with\nsignificant gender effects were removed or considered for\nfurther modification to ensure the tool was applicable to all\nchildren irrespective of gender. Using the predicted probabilities\nfound from the logistic regression analyses, the ages correspond-\ning to 25%, 50%, 75% and 90% of the children passing were\ndetermined for each item. These were then used to plot the age\nnorms of achievement of each milestone in a box-type\nrepresentation.\nReliability of the items\nReliability for each item was tested by using two subsamples of\n60 (inter-observer) and 28 (intra-observer) randomly selected\nchildren who were seen at 7 and 14 days after initial\nassessment. Of the 60 children, 46 completed the follow-up\nusing two different examiners (inter-observer), while 25 of the\n28 children used the same examiner (intra-observer). All items\nin the tool were assessed for both types of reliability. Kappa\nstatistics (k) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to\ncalculate the degree of observer agreement for each question.\nPositive values of 0 to ,0.2 indicate poor agreement, .0.2 to 0.4\nfair agreement, .0.4 to 0.6 moderate agreement, .0.6 to 0.8\ngood agreement and .0.8 to 1 very good agreement.\n40\nRespondent validation was carried out after the preliminary\nanalysis. This method of validation involves the reporting of\nfindings back to the participants. Findings were fed back at the\nend of the study to the Lungwena Health Centre Management\nCommittee. This consisted of four chiefs, one overall represen-\ntative and three women representatives, all from the local area.\nConsensus meeting\nOnce all the items were analysed, an expert panel (MG, AJ, EM\nand GL), which included a Malawian paediatrician, met to\nreview the results and decide which items should remain, which\nshould be modified and which should be removed. Items were\njudged on their graphical representation, and goodness of fit on\nlogistic regression, reliability and subjective ratings of ‘‘inter-\npretability’’ by participants and researchers.\nRESULTS\nA tool with 138 items (34 gross motor (GM), 34 fine motor\n(FM), 35 language and 35 social items) was created. An example\nof the tool is shown in supplemental fig B (see supplementary\ndata). Most (58%) items were from the DDST and Denver II,\nwith a small percentage (9%) from the Griffith’s instrument.\nMany items in the GM (82%), language (77%) and FM (70%)\nsections were directly translated from Western tests with\nmodifications mainly in the FM section. Only 37% of the social\nitems were taken from Western tests. The first two columns of\ntable 1 provide examples of many of the items that were\nremoved from the DDST or Denver II, and shows the newly\ncreated items which replaced them.\nThe face validity and content validity of the tool were tested.\nThe modified instrument appeared to those questioned to cover\ndevelopment in children in ways that were important, and it\nwas judged to examine in a fully comprehensive and logical\nfashion the domains of child development for children in\nMalawi. It was therefore considered to have good face validity\nand content validity. Most items were found to be acceptable\nfor studying children’s development in this setting through\nrespondent validity. The pictures as prompts were found to be\nparticularly helpful to the researchers in the field.\nExamples of graphs created through logistic regression during\nthe standardisation procedure and where triple split joined\nFigure 2 Examples of (A) a good logistic fit for fine motor question 8\n‘‘Transfers objects from hand to hand’’, (B) spline fit for gross motor\nquestion 17 ‘‘Walks backwards’’, and (C) a poorly worded question\n(social question (SOC) 16 ‘‘Can put clothes on with help’’).\nOriginal article\n26 Arch Dis Child 2008;93:23–29. doi:10.1136/adc.2006.095471\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on November 5, 2025 http://adc.bmj.com/Downloaded from 22 March 2007. 10.1136/adc.2006.095471 on Arch Dis Child: first published as \nregression was used, are shown in fig 2. In terms of goodness of\nfit on logistic regression and on spline regression, social items\nhad the highest number of poor fits (51%, 18/35), sex being an\nindependent predictor in some of these (23%, 8/35) (see table 2).\nA larger proportion of the newly created items had a poor fit on\nlogistic regression (15%, 7/46) and an effect of sex (17%, 8/46)\nthan those from the Western tools. The few items not attained\nby 6 years came from the fine motor area of development and\nincluded ‘‘draws a man with 6 parts’’ and ‘‘draws a square’’. The\nresults of the Lungwena milestones for the language section of\ndevelopment are shown in fig 3. The other areas of development\nare described in supplemental fig C (see supplementary data).\nReliability results are also shown in table 2.\nFor inter-observer reliability, 82% (113/138) of the questions\nhad moderate to very good reliability (k .0.4). There are no\nfigures in the Denver technical manual for inter-observer\nreliability for comparison. Intra-observer reliability demon-\nstrated moderate to very good reliability (k .0.4) for 75%\n(106/138) of the questions. This compares well with Denver II\nfigures,\n34 where 81% of their items had a k.0.4.

In relation to the source of the item, more of the locally-\nderived items had poor inter-observer (33/46) and intra-observer\n(15/46) reliability (k,0.4) in comparison to those items derived\nfrom the Denver II (12/80 and 8/80).\nAfter a consensus meeting, 110 of the 138 items (80%) were\nretained in the revised instrument, with some needing further\nmodification. Only 69% (32/46) of the newly created items\nwere retained in comparison to 86% (69/80) of the DDST or\nDenver items used (see table 2). The results of this meeting\ngiving examples of items removed are detailed in the last two\ncolumns of table 1.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have demonstrated that many items from Western tools can\nwork well when adapted and translated for other settings. They\nhave already had their own rigorous reliability and validity\nstudies carried out in the West and therefore are more likely to\nbe robust in use. However, through our focus group, validation\nand piloting work, we have also demonstrated that in all\ndomains of Western tests (such as the DDST), there are some\nitems which are culturally inappropriate for a rural African\npopulation. For example, questions such as ‘‘prepares cereal’’ or\n‘‘plays board games/card games’’ are uncommon activities for\nchildren in rural Africa. Also, the pink doll in the DDST kit was\nterrifying to most children when used in piloting; many children\nhad never seen anything like it and many screamed. It would\nhave been unlikely that we would have been able to get them to\nsit down and ‘‘feed the doll’’. Some of the naming questions in\nthe Language section of the DDST or Denver II have pictures of\nobjects that children, at least in the part of rural Africa studied,\nhave never seen before, such as a horse and a car. This makes it\ndifficult for them to name them, especially as many children\nhave also never seen a book at their age, or pictorial\nrepresentations of many objects.\nIn the creation of new items, however, many newly created\nitems were less reliable, more sex-specific and had poorer\ngoodness of fit in logistic regression. This was most evident in\nthe social domain and least evident for gross motor skills. Social\nskills seem to have the least ‘‘universality’’ and in measuring\nthem, we need to question the appropriateness of the concepts\nbeing measured in such different settings. When measuring\n‘‘social skills’’ we may be determining the ability of the child to\nhave learned important skills instilled by parents and carers in\nparticular cultural settings, but this can only be measured if\npertinent skills are tested for. The difficulty when creating new\nsocial items for a tool such as this, is that the items must be\nspecific enough to distinguish between the developmental age\nranges of children, but also be clear and easy to explain in a\ndevelopmental tool. This will continue to be a challenge.\nIt was not a primary aim of our study to compare our results\nwith the Denver II or DDST. A formal statistical comparison\nhas not been possible; however, when comparing our charts\nwith those from the Denver II or DDST on gross comparison, it\ndoes seem that there are obvious differences in milestones with\nchildren from the West. For example, the item ‘‘combines two\nwords’’ in the Denver II is attained at between 17 and\n21 months, whereas in our sample this was obtained at between\n21 months and 2 years 4 months. This demonstrates the\nimportance and necessity of creating norms for a given\nAfrican population, as they are likely to be different from those\nin the West.\nA second phase of work is currently underway using the\nmethodology that we have formulated in this first study to\nrefine a further tool with a larger standardisation sample. This\nwork will include creating a scoring system, and carrying out\nmore detailed reliability measurements and further validity tests\nof between-group and construct validity. Once this new version\nhas been created and has undergone the strict procedures that\nwe have instituted in our methodology, we hope to have created\na tool that may benefit community health workers in other\nrural settings in Africa after local validation. The complete tool\nmay also be used by research workers who are investigating\ndevelopmental outcomes as part of their intervention strategies.\nAcknowledgements: Our thanks to all the staff and research assistants at the\nLungwena Child Survival Study site in Lungwena, Malawi, to Professor R Broadhead,\nhead of the Department of Paediatrics at the College of Medicine in Blantyre, Malawi,\nto Professor MB Duggan, professor in paediatrics and community health who worked\nat the College of Medicine in Malawi when the study was carried out for her help and\nsuggestions, and Dr L Rosenbloom, recently retired consultant paediatric neurologist at\nthe Royal Liverpool Children’s Hospital, for his help and suggestions.

Gross motor items are\nmost reliable, whereas items within the social area of\ndevelopment need to account for cultural differences.\nOriginal article\n28 Arch Dis Child 2008;93:23–29. doi:10.1136/adc.2006.095471\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies. \n. by guest on November 5, 2025 http://adc.bmj.com/Downloaded from 22 March 2007. 10.1136/adc.2006.095471 on Arch Dis Child: first published as \n8.
