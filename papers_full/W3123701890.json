    "abstract": "Abstract Mechanical shift of windings is serious problem of power transformers which belong to the very significant components of power engineering system. Mechanical displacements and following insulation failure due to short circuit and inrush currents can lead to an emergency situation. That’s why the effective control technology of windings is an relevant task of a current power engineering. A new approach to winding state control technology is described in the paper. The described technology is based on nanosecond probing impulse duration with short (no more than 20 ns) rapidness of front impulse. The experimental results of sensitivity growth at decreasing front pulse duration are shown. The experimental equipment and research are described. It is established that duration of probing impulse has optimum value around 100ns. It is shown that it is possible to do a condition control under operating voltage. It is shown that both shorter probing impulse and front of probe pulse duration allows upgrading common effectiveness of the diagnostic technology.",
