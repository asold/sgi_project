CAF combines\nstress relaxation and age hardening into a single forming pro-\ncess, and the synchronous occurrence of the two phenomena\nreduces ongoing manufacturing cost significantly [2]. Benefit-\nting from its unique process mechanisms, CA-manufactured\nparts require a low forming stress and contain low residual\nstresses which enhance fatigue resistance and improve\nstrength-to-weight ratio of the final product [ 1].\nAt present, it is economically feasible to employ CAF to\nproduce only dimensionally large parts in small batch quanti-\nties due to the long processing hours required. The latest re-\nsearch into CAF therefore is mainly focussed on the manufac-\nture of aircraft wing panels. From the production of the\nGulfstream IV ’s wing skins by Textron to the upper wing\npanels of the latest £270m Airbus (Toulouse, France) A380\nsuperjumbo [3–6], CAF has already proven its practicality in\nthe manufacturing of aircraft wing components. However, a\nnumber of challenges remain — one of which is the develop-\nment of flexible CAF tools.\nThe need for flexible tools, particularly for manufacturing\nwing skin panels, is largely due to (i) the high cost of tools for\nforming large wing panels. For many years, aircraft manufac-\nturers have been seeking for universal tooling that can form\nwing panels of different shape. Each aircraft wing has a\nunique aerofoil with complex requirements exclusive to a par-\nticular airplane model (Fig. 1), and specific tooling must be\ndeveloped for each new wing design. Boeing (Chicago, USA)\nhas revealed that the development of new tooling and facilities\nfor each new airplane wing design commonly exceeds many\nmillions of dollars [ 7]. Maintenance costs of the developed\ntool will also add-on over the production lifespan of an air-\nplane. (ii) The need to compensate for springback of CA-\nformed parts, which requires expensive and time-consuming\nshape rectification of conventional tools. Springback is a com-\nmon problem amongst the production process of sheet metal\nparts. According to the figures provided by General Motors\n(Michigan, USA), the economic impact of delayed production\nand tooling revision costs due to springback alone was esti-\nmated to be over US$50m a year in the automotive industry\n[8]. This is an even bigger problem when translated to CAF as\nspringback of CA-formed parts can reach up to 80 %, and the\nabruptly changing thicknesses of wing panels also further\ncomplicates the mechanism of springback in practical opera-\ntions [4, 9–11].\nTo enable springback to be predicted, a material and pro-\ncess model is necessary, and this must be based on compre-\nhensive experimental data. These data must cover a wide\nrange of test conditions including varying tool shape, part\n362 Int J Adv Manuf Technol (2015) 80:361 –372\nthickness and heat treatment cycle. Changing tool shape poses\nthe biggest challenge of all and is responsible for the current\nlack of experimental data available for the validation of\nexisting models. Modifying the tool shape of conventional\nsolid-matched dies not only requires expensive precision ap-\nparatus and long hours of machining but also generates large\namount of waste material as a result. Solid dies are also heavy\nin weight, which makes maintenance and handling of the tool\ndifficult. Iteratively reworking the dies ’surfaces to modify\ntool shape is therefore uneconomical and has led to the con-\ncept of flexible CAF tools.\nConventional flexible tools require the use of tightly\npacked forming pins to create a continuous forming surface;\nthis is the theoretical base of a group of flexible dies that are\ncharacterised by arrays of discretised punch elements. One of\nthe earliest organised activities with published results and val-\nidated conclusions on discrete dies were by Walczyk et al. in\n1998 [12]. Based on their estimation for forming body panels\nof an F-14 fighter aircraft using a 1×2 m forming tool, the cost\nof using a discrete die was approximated to be US$1.4m with\nconsumables inclusive, which was only 28 % of the cost of\nusing hard tooling [ 12]. The growing trend of discrete tooling\nwith the lack of scientific development has led the authors to\ncarry out further research on the design and analysis of dis-\ncrete dies, where numerous examples had been given to illus-\ntrate the mechanics of discrete tooling [ 13]. This method of\nforming was coined the term ‘multi-point forming (MPF)’by\nLi et al. in 1997, who later has led the MPF technique to find a\nwide range of applications, from shipbuilding to the\nmanufacturing of titanium cranial prostheses [ 14–18].\nSuch conventional tools are heavy and unfavourable to\nCAF processes which require frequent transportation of the\ntooling. The number of pins in a flexible tool, or part count,\nis a key to the advancement of the current flexible tooling\ntechnology. Part count plays an important role as reducing it\nreduces both the weight and the costs of manufacturing\nand maintaining the tool at the same time. In this research, a\nflexible lightweight tool concept is introduced to control the\ntool shape using a series of spline shapes with fewer\nsupporting points for each spline.\nIn this paper, an existing state-of-the-art flexible CAF tool\nis first described and analysed. The reader is then introduced\nto the concept of modularity in design and its application to\nthe existing tooling. Applying the modular design concept to\nthe existing tool partitions it into functional elements, and a\nproof-of-concept prototype is constructed using the function-\ning elements only, thus achieving part count reduction. Sup-\nported by a series of theoretical studies, subsequent evaluation\nof the prototype demonstrates the promising potential of this\nnew method of design.\n2 A current state-of-the-art flexible CAF tool\nLiterature on CAF-specific tool designs is scarce. An impor-\ntant contribution is the Airbus rib boards forming tool for\nforming aircraft wing panel components [ 4, 19]. For the pur-\npose of illustration, a schematic of the rib boards forming tool\nis shown in Fig. 2.\nFigure 2a shows an isometric view of the tool, which\nmakes use of two horizontal guide rails that are rigidly bolted\non to a base (not illustrated). N\nm pairs of vertical guide rails are\nfirmly supported by the horizontal guide rails and can slide\nonly in the x2 direction. Once slid to the required x2,e a c hp a i r\nof vertical guide rails is bolted to the horizontal guide rails,\nthus are structurally supported by both the horizontal guide\nrails and the base. The vertical guide rails from this instance\nonwards are firmly fixed in position. The i\nth and (i+1)th pairs\nof vertical guide rails are now spaced dj apart in the x2 direc-\ntion, where i=1,2,3, … ,Nm and j=1,2,3, … ,(Nm−1) for a tool\nwith Nm modules.\nWith reference to Fig. 2b,t h e ith module, which is a metal\nsheet with a profile described by Si, is chosen for each pair of\nvertical guide rails. Once positioned, each module is firmly\nbolted to the vertical guide rails. Each of Si contains a 2D\npoint cloud in the x1x3 plane and is chosen so that when all\nmodules are positioned at the correct x2,d e f l e c t i o ns u r f a c eo f\nthe uniformly loaded intermediate sheet, placed on top of all\nmodules, it will form the shape of the required forming surface\nwithin predefined tolerances.\nThe positioned modules of thickness as, topped by the in-\ntermediate sheet and blank, are shown in Fig. 2c.T h i si sa\ngeneric tool design such that modules with various profiles\ncan be mounted to the vertical guide rails. The modules, ver-\ntical and horizontal guide rails and the base, which all together\nform a rigid supporting structure, are made of tooling steel that\nare substantially stiff and undergo negligible deformation dur-\ning a CAF process.\nIn a typical CAF process, an intermediate sheet of h\nint thick\nis first placed on the rigid supporting structure. The interme-\ndiate sheet is made of spring-tempered steel with a yield\nstrength, σ\ny,int, sufficiently high to prevent it deforming plas-\ntically during CAF. A blank, which for the current aerofoil\nbeing produced, has a shape close to that of a trapezium, is\nthen placed on the upper surface of the intermediate sheet.\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nNormalised \nNormalised \nFig. 1 Aerofoil profiles of three different aircraft\nInt J Adv Manuf Technol (2015) 80:361 –372 363\nWith the use of vacuum bagging technique [ 1, 4, 20, 21],\nthe uppermost surface of the blank is subjected to a uniformly\ndistributed pressure load q that acts towards negative x3.B o t h\nthe blank and the intermediate sheet deform towards negative\nx\n3 as air is drawn away slowly over a duration of t1.F i n a l\nshapes of the blank and the intermediate sheet will conform\nto the shape defined by the modules, Si.\nThe deformed blank and intermediate sheet are then held at\nthis configuration by q whilst the whole apparatus is placed in\nan oven. The oven provides a heat treatment cycle to the\nwhole apparatus at an elevated temperature, T,f o ra\npredetermined period of time, t2. The blank undergoes plastic\ndeformation during this period, as the material constituents of\nthe blank precipitate, altering the microstructure of the alloy,\nthereby strengthening it [1, 5, 22, 23]. Tand t\n2 that characterise\na heat treatment cycle are unique to each alloy and are set so\nthat the CA-formed part will have final mechanical properties\nthat meet the strength specification.\nAfter time t\n2, the oven is ventilated to allow the apparatus\nto return to room temperature. The cooled apparatus is then\nremoved from the oven, and q is slowly released over a period\nof t\n3 as air returns back into the vacuumed environment. As a\nresult of residual elastic stresses, the blank springs back to a\nshape somewhere between its original shape and the shape\ndefined by S\ni. The intermediate sheet fully springs back to\nits original shape and is ready to be reused again. The pressure\nloading profile of a typical CAF process is illustrated in Fig. 3.\nAccording to the inventor, A. Levers, the tool has led to a\n50 % reduction in tooling costs and more efficient processes\nfor the production of wing panel components. These are the\nkey factors that have made CAF practical for Airbus [ 4].\n3 Concept of modularity in design for flexible tooling\nLever’s tool has been designed by modularising the base\nstructure of a conventional solid die in the x2 direction [ 4],\nwhich results in the design that is only flexible in one dimen-\nsion. From a design point of view, this is known as a 1D-\nmodularised tool design, and a number of published articles\nhave already proven it practical for the CAF of large aircraft\npanel components [ 4, 24–27]. In this section, the flexible di-\nmension of Lever ’st o o l(x\n2) is retained, and flexibility of the\ntool is introduced to the other dimensions ( x1 and x3). The\nresult is a 3D-modularised tool design concept with enhanced\nflexibility.\nFirst consider a single module from the tool presented in\nFig. 2. The subscripts i and j are dropped and the steps\ntaken towards profile modularisation (Fig. 4) is described\nbelow.\nModel idealisation Deletion/ modification of the geometric\nfeatures are first carried out so that only the key geometric\nfeatures of the original design are kept.\nA\nA\nModule\nModule\nIntermediate \nsheet\nBlank\nProfile of the \nmodule, \nVertical \nguide rails\nHorizontal \nguide rail (b)(a)\n(c) Section A-A\nFig. 2 Schematics of a 1D-\nmodularised CAF tool showing a\nan isometric view of the tool, b a\nsingle module and c view on\ncross-section A-A\nPressure \nload, MPa\nLoading Creep-ageing Release\nSpringback\nFig. 3 Loading profile of a typical CAF process\n364 Int J Adv Manuf Technol (2015) 80:361 –372\nProfile modularisation Concept of modularity in design is\napplied to a single module profile. Profile Cs is described by\na mathematical spline and is a function of only the position of\neach control point, Xcp(x1,cp,x3,cp), in the x1x3 plane. cp indi-\ncates the current control point that is being considered, such\nthat cp=1,2,3, … ,N\np for a spline that has Np control points.\nDistances between control points can be adjustable and the\ndistance between the cp\nth and ( cp+1)th controlling points is\ndp,jp, where jp=1,2,3,… ,(Np−1).\nDuring profile modularisation, a new parameter, Cs,i si n -\ntroduced which represents a shape that is a result of the posi-\ntions of the controlling points in the x\n1x3 plane. From a theo-\nretical standpoint, Cs=S (the target shape) can be achieved as\nNp→∞ with dp,jp→ 0, which in fact is the working principle\nbehind conventional flexible tools. In reality however, an in-\ncrease in Np must translate to an increase in part count, and this\nhinders conventional flexible tools from being used in CAF.\nThrough a proof-of-concept prototype followed by a series of\nanalyses, a method for designing flexible CAF tools using\nsparsely spaced controlling points (reducingNp whilst increas-\ning dp,jp) is evaluated in the remaining text.\n4 A proof-of-concept prototype and its characterisation\nIn this section, a proof-of-concept prototype, manufactured for\nevaluating the proposed design, is presented. A corresponding\nanalytical model is developed and experimentally validated.\nFinally, evaluation of the design method is conducted by com-\nparing the validation results with that of the subsequent finite\nelement (FE) simulations.\n4.1 Proof-of-concept prototype\nFigure 5 shows a generalised schematic of the testing proto-\ntype. The prototype has been manufactured with N\np= 5 and dp,\njp= 120 mm for all jp. A 600-mm-long spring-tempered steel\nstrip (the mechanical spline) with dimensions of as=3 5m m\nand hs= 1 mm in the x2 and x3 directions, respectively, is\nattached to and interpolates between all cp.W h i l s tCs of a\nmathematical spline (Fig. 4) depends only on Np and Xcp, Cs\nof a mechanical spline depends also on its flexural rigidity ( Fs)\nwhich is the product of multiplication between the spline ’s\nYoung’sm o d u l u s(Es) and second moment of area ( Is=ashs\n3/\n12). A novel spline-pins attachment method is conceived and\nemployed, and once the spline is attached to the pins, the\nspline can slide only in the x1 direction whilst x3 is fixed by\nthe sparse controlling points. As a result, Cs changes as x3,cp\nare adjusted.\n4.2 Analytical modelling: inversed Macaulay ’s method\nBased on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory [ 28, 29], an analyt-\nical model (Fig. 6) is developed for the characterisation of the\ntesting prototype. Xcp contains the position of each control pin\nModule\nBlank\nIntermediate \nsheet\nProfile of an \narbitrary module, \nModel \nidealisation\nControl points’ locations, \nProfile \nmodularisation\nFig. 4 Profile modularisation\nwith mathematical splines and\nsparse controlling points\nElastically deformed spline \nwith \nSparse \ncontrolling pin,\nBase\n1 2 …\n1 2 …\nFig. 5 A generalised schematic\nof the proof-of-concept prototype\nInt J Adv Manuf Technol (2015) 80:361 –372 365\nin the x1x3 plane. x1 of the leftmost control pin is set to, x1,1=0\nin all cases. Therefore ; x1;Np always represent the deformed\nspline’sl e n g t h .Cs can be displaced by altering Fs and Xcp.\nMacaulay’s method is adopted due to its generic form and\nis therefore easy to be implemented into computer programs\n[30].

Classical beam equation, however, seeks forces as\ninput and return x3, M and σ11 along the length of the spline\nas outputs. A method must therefore be introduced to es-\ntablish a set of displacement-based equations, so that the\ndisplacements at specific points on the beam (in this case,\nx\n3,cp) become input parameters. K1, K2 and Pcp together\nrepresent seven unknowns; seven equations are therefore\nneeded for the equations to be solved. Together with the\nfive displacement boundary conditions, the spline must\nalso satisfy force and moment balance — t h e s eg i v et h es e v -\nen equations.\nSolving for the unknowns individually can be a tedious\ntask.

Cs can\nnow be obtained by calculating x3 everywhere along the\nspline. Using MATLAB (vR2012b, MathWorks, Natick,\nMA, USA) for matrix handling, Cs due to x3,cp for the three\ntest cases listed in Table 1 is computed. The chosen test cases\naim to simulate different scenario, and stress analyses were\nconducted to ensure each bending curvature is valid — the so-\nlution is valid as long as the maximum bending stress in the\nspline remains smaller than its yield strength, σ\n11\nmax <σy,s.\nValues of Np, dp and Is identical to that of the prototype were\nused and Es= 207 GPa in all cases.\n4.3 Experimental validation\nResults due to the analytical solution have been experimental-\nly validated using the prototype. Initially, x3,cp was set to zero\nfor all cp; the spline was then attached to the pins. x3 was\nslowly adjusted for each cp and continuously monitored by\na digital height gauge with an accuracy of ± 0.01 mm through-\nout the adjustment process.\nWith x3,cp correctly adjusted for all cp, the resulting Cs\nbetween x1,1 and x1,5 was measured using a coordinate\nmeasuring machine (CMM LK G90C, Nikon Metrology, Der-\nby, England, UK) as shown in Fig. 7. Three sets of measure-\nments per test case have been recorded, and the mean shape\nwas used.\n4.4 FE simulation\nCorresponding FE analyses were carried out using PAM-\nSTAMP (v2G 2012.0, ESI Group, Paris, France). Geometric\nmodels of the forming pins were generated using SolidWorks\n(v2012 Education Edition, Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks,\nWaltham, MA, USA) as IGES files v5.3 and imported into\nPAM-STAMP as rigid bodies through the “Tools” module.\nThe spline was represented by a 600 × 35 mm geometric\nmodel created in the “Blank” module and meshed using\nBelytschko-Tsay shell elements in second strain order. Gauss\nrule was used with 10 integration points through the 1-mm-\nthick shell elements. Mechanical properties of the spline iden-\ntical to those used for analytical modelling were assigned with\na Poisson’sr a t i oo f v=0 . 3 .C a r t e s i a nk i n e m a t i c so ft h ep i n s\nwas locked in all directions except in x\n3, which were user-\ndefined displacements to match those in Table 1. Frictionless\ncontacts between the spline and pins were defined. FE simu-\nlated results were then evaluated with the analytical and ex-\nperimental results.\n4.5 Evaluation\nIn a conventional wing skin panel shape inspection process, a\nformed panel is lowered by an overhead crane and placed on a\nmechanical fixture— a tool that is used to ensure the formed\npanel is within the required assembly tolerance. Although dif-\nferent requirements may be given, a vertical distance\nrepresenting the size of the gap between the formed compo-\nnent and the contour of the check fixture is usually considered\nan acceptable requirement for large aircraft components [ 31].\nFor example, an assembly tolerance of −0, +1 mm is required\nfor the Airbus A380 wing skin [ 4], and the panel must be bent\nto within this tolerance to ensure the panel will not be\noverstressed during the subsequent assembling procedure.\nBased on the conventional use of this original definition by\naircraft manufacturers and its easy-to-interpret nature, vertical\ndifference between experimental and modelling results is used\nfor profile evaluation.\nComparisons of the simulated profiles (FE) with the ana-\nlytical (IMM) and experimental (Exp.) profiles are shown in\nFig. 8. Good correlation between the deflection profile ( u\n3)o f\nthe three can be seen. Vertical differences between u3 of the\nexperimental and the IMM or FE results are all found to be\nbounded by ± 1 mm. This shows that the method is suitable\nfor designing flexible CAF tools with less than ± 1 mm error\nin the forming surface.\nTable 1 Individual height of the pins in the three test cases\nShape description x3,cp,m m\ncp= 1 23 45\nTest case 1 Symmetric U-shape 32.50 10.00 0.00 10.00 32.50\nTest case 2 Symmetric W-shape 8.00 0.00 3.00 0.00 8.00\nTest case 3 Anti-symmetric 15.00 10.00 3.00 6.00 0.00\nFig. 7 Spline shape measurement using a coordinate measuring machine\nInt J Adv Manuf Technol (2015) 80:361 –372 367\n5 Solution to a pseudo-rigid spline with shape Cs≈S\nunder pressure q\nSuccessful implementation of this design method must\nrequire Cs≈S within an acceptable shape tolerance ( δstol)\nunder any q that is experienced by the spline in a typical\nCAF process (Fig. 3).

Equations of similar form to that of Eqs. 5 to 8\n(and thus Cs) can be obtained by following the same treatment\nas above together with the consideration of q in the moment\nand force balances. The result is an analytical model for a\nspline with Cs controlled by Fs and Xcp, that is uniformly\nloaded by q.\nIt is a requirement to simulate a rigid spline whose\nshape can remain Cs≈S under the action of q.T h ei d e a\nof rigidity is such that under any applied q, stiffness of the\nspline is so high that either its shape does not change, or\nthe change is negligible. Thus, it can be hypothesised that\nby carrying out optimisation on certain process parame-\nters, a solution to a pseudo-rigid spline with shape Cs≈S\ncan be reached within the required δs\ntol. Based on this\nhypothesis, three parameters that can cause Cs to deviate\nfrom given S are identified and optimised — these are Np,\nx1,cp and hs.\nTrust-region optimisation (TRO) algorithm is employed\nto optimise Cs ks ,w h e r e ks =1,2,3,… , Nsiter for an\noptimisation process with Nsiter iterations.

Key outputs from the optimisa-\ntion code are tabulated in Table 3.\n8 Discussion\nS1 simulates a general curvature that is similar to those seen in\nthe aerofoils of a typical aircraft (Fig. 1). δs has been optimised\nfrom 22.71 to 0.37 mm and hs has changed from 1 to 2.58 mm\nafter nine iterations. Three control points are sufficient to\nachieve S1,a n dX cp has only moved slightly from their orig-\ninal positions. σ11\nmax= 209.5 MPa, which means that the defor-\nmation is elastic and the solution is therefore valid.\nYes.\nNo. .\nOptimise\nOutput and \nTrust-region optimisation (TRO)\nInversed Macaulay’s method (IMM)\nInitiation\nGiven shape to be achieved within \nExit flags\nFig. 9 Flow diagram of the integrated optimisation process for tool\noffsetting\nTable 2 Assigned parameters in steps 1 and 2 of the integrated\noptimisation process\nas,\nmm\nx1;Np ;\nmm\nEs,\nMPa\nq,\nNm m −1\nσy,s,\nMPa\nLsiter δstol,\nmm\nNp\n0 hs\n0\n,\nmm\n35 500 207000 1 1014 500 1 3 1\n(a) (b)\nBefore \noffsetting\nAfter \noffsetting\nBefore \noffsetting\nAfter \noffsetting\nmm\nmm mm\nFig. 10 Case S1:c o m p a r i n ga u3\nand b Rs/δstol of S1 with Cs0 and\nCs9\nInt J Adv Manuf Technol (2015) 80:361 –372 369\nS2 aims to achieve a more complex shape with continuous-\nly changing curvatures. From Fig. 11a,o n ec a ni m m e d i a t e l y\nsee that three control points are insufficient for S2.D e s p i t eXcp\nhave been displaced significantly and hs has increased from 1\nto 5 mm, δs has changed only from 89.32 to 52.93 mm upon\nreaching Nsiter — Cs≈S could not be achieved as a result.\nIntroduction of two additional controlling points are found\nto be necessary in order for the required S2 to be achieved.\nFigure 11c shows S2 is achieved by optimising hs and Xcp with\nNp= 5. Final δs is 0.97 mm, and hs has changed from 1 to\n1.14 mm. However, this solution was found invalid because\nσ\n11\nmax= 1903.4 MPa, which is greater than σy,s.\nCase S1 shows a classic example of how the current design\nmethod can be used for forming structures that have a general\ncurvature, such as that seen in the aerofoils of typical aircraft\nwing skins. From this study, it can be seen that the deviation of\nCs from S c a nb ec o n t r o l l e db yc h a n g i n go n l yhs.\nBecause the functioning of the current design and the cor-\nresponding theoretical studies rely heavily on the Euler-\nBernoulli beam theory, the assumptions that the theory is\nbased on also pose several limitations on the current design\nmethod. This can be overcome by extending or replacing the\nEuler-Bernoulli beam theory to account for what is needed.\nFor example, one may use the Timoshenko beam theory to\naccount for shear effects. Stephen ’s work in 2007 already\ndemonstrated how it can be coupled with the Macaulay ’s\nmethod [33], but discussion of this is beyond the scope of this\npaper.\nAs mentioned earlier, Cs=S can be achieved as N\np→∞,\nand this is the theoretical base of conventional discrete\ntooling. The key advantage of this latest method of tool design\nover conventional discrete tooling is its lightweight design.\nTaking the prototype manufactured for this study as an exam-\nple, the 600×60×60 mm steel base weighs 17 kg. It was\nmounted with five controlling pins, each weighs 1 kg. Togeth-\ner with the 600×35×1 mm spline, the testing prototype has a\ntotal weight of just over 22 kg.

Not only is the present design cheaper but it is also\neasier to maintain due to less material used and its lightweight\ndesign. Fewer pins also means shorter set-up time is required;\nthis will result in a significant reduction in the manufacturer ’s\nongoing costs [7, 34], justifying the tool’s return on investment.\nConsidering the typical application of CAF is for manufacturing\naircraft wing panels and a typical wing skin panel is about 33 m\nlong with a maximum width of 2.7 m [19], the amount of weight\nreduced at such a large scale will be far more substantial. This\ncan largely influence the decision made by aircraft manufacturers\nas to whether or not to adopt CAF as a new forming process [7].\nAlthough a flexible tool, the major shortcoming of the rib\nboards design illustrated in Fig. 2 is also its flexibility. Whilst\nthe tool is flexible in x\n2, aerofoil of the wing panel that is to be\nformed remains determined by the shape, S, that is machined\ninto each module. This means for every new wing design, or\nany adjustments that are required for springback compensa-\ntion, a new set of modules must be made. The economic im-\npact of such practice is already highlighted earlier in this arti-\ncle— with two extra degrees of freedom in the x\n1 and x3 direc-\ntions, the present tool design will not have such problem.\n9 Conclusions\nA method for designing flexible CAF tools was conceived and\nevaluated using a prototype that has been manufactured for this\nstudy. Theoretical studies were carried out in order to character-\nise the prototype. An integrate d optimisation process for tool\noffsetting was then introduced, and its use was also demonstrat-\ned. It was confirmed that CAF tools with less than ±1 mm error\nin the forming surface can be achieved with the proposed design\nmethod. Furthermore, this error can in theory be compensated,\nand thus eliminated from the final CA-formed parts, using the\nproposed tool offsetting method. This novel design concept can\nnow be used to construct lightweight and flexible CAF tools.\nAcknowledgements The strong support from Aviation Industry Cor-\nporation of China (A VIC) Beijing Aeronautical Manufacturing Technol-\nogy Research Institute (BAMTRI) for this funded research is much ap-\npreciated.
