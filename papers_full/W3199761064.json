Furthermore, empirical results on\ndomain transfer and task transfer show that\nCHILD -TUNING can obtain better generaliza-\ntion performance by large margins.\n1 Introduction\nPretrained Language Models (PLMs) have had a\nremarkable effect on the natural language process-\ning (NLP) landscape recently (Devlin et al., 2019;\nLiu et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2020). Pretraining and\nﬁne-tuning have become a new paradigm of NLP,\ndominating a large variety of tasks.\nDespite its great success, how to adapt such\nlarge-scale pretrained language models with mil-\nlions to billions of parameters to various scenarios,\nespecially when the training data is limited, is still\nchallenging. Due to the extremely large capac-\nity and limited labeled data, conventional trans-\nfer learning tends to aggressive ﬁne-tuning (Jiang\net al., 2020), resulting in: 1) degenerated results\non the test data due to overﬁtting (Devlin et al.,\n2019; Phang et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020), and 2)\n∗Equal Contribution.

In addition,\nMixout (Lee et al., 2020) randomly replaces part of\nthe model parameters with their pretrained weights\nduring ﬁne-tuning. The core idea behind them is\nto utilize the pretrained weights to regularize the\nﬁne-tuned model.\nIn this paper, we propose to mitigate the aggres-\nsive ﬁne-tuning problem from a new perspective.\nBased on the observation that it is unnecessary to\nupdate all the parameters within the large-scale\nmodel during ﬁne-tuning, we propose an effec-\ntive ﬁne-tuning technique, CHILD -TUNING , which\nstraightforwardly updates a subset of parameters\n(called child network) via strategically masking\nout the gradients of non-child network in the back-\nward process, as illustrated in Figure 1. Note that\n9515\nit is different from model pruning, since it still for-\nwards on the whole network, thus making the full\nuse of knowledge hidden in the pretrained weights.\nIn detail, we propose two variants, CHILD -\nTUNING F and CHILD -TUNING D, which respec-\ntively detect the child network in a task-free and\na task-driven way. CHILD -TUNING F chooses out\nthe child network in the absence of task data via a\nBernoulli distribution. It introduces noise to the full\ngradients, playing a role of regularization, hence\npreventing overﬁtting to small datasets and lead-\ning to better generalization. Furthermore, CHILD -\nTUNING D utilizes the downstream task data to de-\ntect the most task-related parameters as the child\nnetwork and freezes the parameters in non-child\nnetwork to their pretrained weights. It decreases the\nhypothesis space of the model via a task-speciﬁc\nmask applied to the full gradients, helping to ef-\nfectively adapt the large-scale pretrained model to\nvarious tasks and meanwhile greatly maintain its\noriginal generalization ability.\nOur extensive experiments on the GLUE\nbenchmark show that CHILD -TUNING can be\nmore excellent at ﬁne-tuning different PLMs,\nwith up to 8.60 average score improvement\non CoLA/RTE/MRPC/STS-B tasks compared to\nvanilla ﬁne-tuning (Section. 3.3). Moreover, it\nachieves better generalization ability in transferring\nto out-of-domain data and other related tasks (Sec-\ntion. 3.4). Experimental results also demonstrate\nthat CHILD -TUNING yields consistently greater im-\nprovements than state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuning meth-\nods. More importantly, since CHILD -TUNING\nis orthogonal to these prior methods, integrating\nCHILD -TUNING with them can even lead to further\nimprovements (Section. 4.1).\nIn summary, our contributions are three-fold:\n• We propose CHILD -TUNING , a straightfor-\nward yet effective ﬁne-tuning technique that\nonly updates the parameters in the child net-\nwork. We explore to detect the child network\nin both task-free and task-driven ways.\n• CHILD -TUNING can effectively adapt the\nlarge-scale pretrained model to various down-\nstream scenarios, from in-domain to out-of-\ndomain, and cross-task transfer learning.\n• Since CHILD -TUNING is orthogonal to prior\nﬁne-tuning methods, integrating CHILD -\nTUNING with them can further boost the ﬁne-\ntuning performance.\n2 Methodology\nTo better adapt large-scale pretrained language\nmodel to various downstream tasks, we propose a\nsimple yet effective ﬁne-tuning technique, CHILD -\nTUNING . We ﬁrstly introduce a gradient mask in\nthe backward process to achieve the aim of updat-\ning a subset of parameters (i.e., child network),\nwhile still utilizing the knowledge of the whole\nlarge model in the forward process (Section 2.1).\nThen, we explore two ways to detect the child\nnetwork (i.e., generate different gradient masks):\nCHILD -TUNING F that are in a task-free way (Sec-\ntion 2.2), and CHILD -TUNING D that are in a task-\ndriven way ( Section 2.3).\n2.1 Overview of C HILD -TUNING\nWe start the introduction of CHILD -TUNING by\ngiving a general formulation of the back propaga-\ntion during the vanilla ﬁne-tuning. We denote the\nparameters of the model at the t-th iteration as wt\n(w0 refers to the pretrained weights). The vanilla\nﬁne-tuning computes the gradient of the lossL(wt)\nand then applies gradient descent to all parameters,\nwhich can be formulated as:\nwt+1 = wt −η∂L(wt)\n∂wt\n(1)\nwhere ∂L(wt)\n∂wt are the gradients corresponding to\nthe model parameters wt, ηis the learning rate.\nCHILD -TUNING also backwardly computes the\ngradients of all trainable parameters like standard\nﬁne-tuning. However, the key difference is that\nCHILD -TUNING determines a child network Ct at\nthe t-th iteration, and only updates this part of pa-\nrameters. To achieve this, we ﬁrstly deﬁne a 0-1\nmask that is the same-sized as w as follows:\nM(i)\nt =\n{\n1, w(i)\nt ∈Ct\n0, w(i)\nt /∈Ct\n(2)\nwhere M(i)\nt and w(i)\nt denote the i-th element of\nthe mask Mt and parameters wt at the t-th training\niteration, respectively.\nThen, we formally deﬁne CHILD -TUNING tech-\nnique by simply replacing Eq. 1 with the following\nequation:\nwt+1 = wt −η∂L(wt)\n∂wt\n⊙Mt (3)\nAlgorithm 1 provides the pseudo-code of\nCHILD -TUNING when applied to widely used\nAdam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) optimizer. The main\ndifference is the insertion of line 5-7.\n9516\nAlgorithm 1 CHILD -TUNING for Adam Optimizer\nRequire: w0: initial pretrained weights; L(w):\nstochastic objective function with parameters\nw; η: learning rate; β1,β2 ∈[0,1): exponen-\ntial decay rates for the moment estimates;\n1: initialize timestep t←0, ﬁrst moment vector\nm0 ←0, second moment vector v0 ←0\n2: while not converged do\n3: t←t+ 1\n// Get gradients\n4: gt ←∂L(wt)\n∂wt\n// Get task-free/task-driven child network\n5: Ct ←GetChildNetwork()\n// Generate a corresponding gradient mask\n6: Mt ←GenerateMask(Ct)\n// Employ mask for gradients\n7: gt ←gt ⊙Mt\n8: mt ←β1 ·mt−1 + (1 −β1) ·gt\n9: vt ←β2 ·vt−1 + (1 −β2) ·g2\nt\n// Bias correction\n10: ˆmt ←mt/(1 −βt\n1)\n11: ˆvt ←vt/(1 −βt\n2)\n// Update weights\n12: wt ←wt−1 −η·ˆmt/(√ˆvt + ϵ)\n13: end while\n14: return wt\n2.2 Task-Free Variant: C HILD -TUNING F\nIn this section, we ﬁrstly explore the choice of\nthe child network that does not require any down-\nstream task data, i.e., a task-free technique called\nCHILD -TUNING F. Speciﬁcally, CHILD -TUNING F\ngenerates a 0-1 mask Mt at the t-th iteration drawn\nfrom a Bernoulli distribution with a probability pF:\nMt ∼Bernoulli(pF) (4)\nThe higher the pF is, the larger the child network\nis, and hence more parameters are updated. When\npF = 1 , CHILD -TUNING F degenerates into the\nvanilla ﬁne-tuning method. Note that we also en-\nlarge the reserved gradients by 1\npF\nto maintain the\nexpectation of the gradients.\nWe theoretically justify the effectiveness of\nCHILD -TUNING F. We denote ∆w as the update\nat each iteration:\n∆w = η∂L(w)\n∂w ⊙M (5)\nIntuitively, Theorem 1 shows the variance of gradi-\nents is a strictly decreasing function of pF. Thus,\nCHILD -TUNING F improves the variance of the\ngradients, and the trade-off between exploration\nand exploitation can be controlled by adjusting pF.\nAs illustrated in Theorem 2, with higher variance,\nthe model can converge to more ﬂat local minima\n(smaller ρin Theorem 2). Inspired by studies that\nshow ﬂat minima tends to generalize better (Keskar\net al., 2017; Sun et al., 2020; Foret et al., 2021), we\ncan further prove CHILD -TUNING F decreases the\ngeneralization error bound.\nTheorem 1. Suppose Ldenotes the loss function\non the parameter w, the gradients obey a Gaussian\ndistribution N( ∂L\n∂w,σ2\ngIk), and SGD with learning\nrate ηis used. For a randomly sampled batch B, if\nGradMask reserves gradients with probability pF,\nthe mean and covariance of the update ∆w are,\nE[∆w] = −η∂L\n∂w (6)\nΣ[∆w] = η2σ2\ngIk\npF|B| + (1 −pF)η2diag{∂L\n∂w}2\npF\n(7)\nSpecially, when w is a local minima, E[∆w] =\n0k,Σ[∆w] = σ2Ik and σ2 =\nη2σ2\ng\npF|B| is a strictly\ndecreasing function of pF.\nTheorem 2. Suppose w0 denotes the pretrained\nparameter; kis the number of parameters; w de-\nnotes the local minima the algorithm converges\nto; ρ is the greatest eigenvalue of the Hessian\nmatrix on w, which indicates the sharpness. If\n∆w ∼N(0k,σ2Ik), when the following bound\nholds, the algorithm can converge to the local min-\nima w with high probability,\nρ≤O\n(1\nσ2\n)\n(8)\nSuppose the prior over parameters after training\nis P = N(w0,σ2\n0Ik), the following generalization\nerror bound holds with high probability,\nbound (w) ≤O\n(kσ2\n0 −∥w−w0 ∥2\nσ2\n)\n+ R (9)\nwhere Ris a term not determined by σ.\nThus, CHILD -TUNING F can be viewed as a\nstrong regularization for the optimization process.\nIt enables the model to skip the saddle point in the\nloss landscape and encourages the model to con-\nverge to a more ﬂat local minima. Please refer to\nAppendix E for more details about stated theorems\nand proofs.\n9517\n2.3 Task-Driven Variant: C HILD -TUNING D\nTaking the downstream labeled data into considera-\ntion, we propose CHILD -TUNING D, which detects\nthe most important child network for the target\ntask. Speciﬁcally, we adopt the Fisher informa-\ntion estimation to ﬁnd the highly relevant subset\nof the parameters for a speciﬁc downstream task.\nFisher information serves as a good way to provide\nan estimation of how much information a random\nvariable carries about a parameter of the distribu-\ntion (Tu et al., 2016a,b). For a pretrained model,\nFisher information can be used to measure the rel-\native importance of the parameters in the network\ntowards the downstream tasks.\nFormally, the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)\nfor the model parameters w is deﬁned as follows:\nF (w) = E\n[\n( ∂log p(y|x;w)\n∂w )( ∂log p(y|x;w)\n∂w )⊤\n]\nwhere x and y denote the input and the output\nrespectively. It can be also viewed as the covariance\nof the gradient of the log likelihood with respect\nto the parameters w. Following Kirkpatrick et al.\n(2016), given the task-speciﬁc training data data\nD, we use the diagonal elements of the empirical\nFIM to point-estimate the task-related importance\nof the parameters. Formally, we derive the Fisher\ninformation for the i-th parameter as follows:\nF(i) (w) = 1\n|D|\n|D|∑\nj=1\n(∂log p(yj|xj; w)\n∂w(i)\n)2\n(10)\nWe assume that the more important the parame-\nter towards the target task, the higher Fisher infor-\nmation it conveys. Hence the child network Cis\ncomprised of the parameters with the highest infor-\nmation. The child network ratio is pD = |C|\n|C|+|C|∈\n(0,1], where Cdenotes the non-child network. As\npD rises, the scale of the child network also in-\ncreases, and when pD = 1 it degenerates into the\nvanilla ﬁne-tuning strategy.\nSince the overhead of obtaining the task-driven\nchild network is heavier than that of the task-\nfree one, we simply derive the child network for\nCHILD -TUNING D at the beginning of ﬁne-tuning,\nand keep it unchanged during the ﬁne-tuning, i.e.,\nC0 = C1 = ··· = CT. In this way, CHILD -\nTUNING D dramatically decreases the hypothesis\nspace of the large-scale models, thus alleviating\noverﬁtting. Meanwhile, keeping the non-child net-\nwork freezed to their pretrained weights can sub-\nstantially maintain the generalization ability.\n3 Experiments\n3.1 Datasets\nGLUE benchmark Following previous stud-\nies (Lee et al., 2020; Dodge et al., 2020), we con-\nduct experiments on various datasets from GLUE\nleaderboard (Wang et al., 2019), including linguis-\ntic acceptability (CoLA), natural language infer-\nence (RTE, QNLI, MNLI), paraphrase and similar-\nity (MRPC, STS-B, QQP), and sentiment classiﬁca-\ntion (SST-2). CoLA and SST-2 are single-sentence\nclassiﬁcation tasks and the others are involved with\na pair of sentences. The detailed statistics and met-\nrics are provided in Appendix A. Following most\nprevious works (Phang et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020;\nDodge et al., 2020), we ﬁne-tune the pretrained\nmodel on the training set and directly report results\non the dev set using the last checkpoint, since the\ntest results are only accessible by the leaderboard\nwith a limitation of the number of submissions.\nNLI datasets In this paper, we also conduct\nexperiments to explore the generalization ability\nof the ﬁne-tuned model based on several Natu-\nral Language Inference (NLI) tasks. Speciﬁcally,\nwe additionally introduce three NLI datasets, i.e.,\nSICK (Marelli et al., 2014), SNLI (Bowman et al.,\n2015) and SciTail (Khot et al., 2018). We also\nreport results on the dev set consistent with GLUE.\n3.2 Experiments Setup\nWe use the pretrained models and codes pro-\nvided by HuggingFace 1 (Wolf et al., 2020), and\nfollow their default hyperparameter settings un-\nless noted otherwise. Appendix B provides\ndetailed experimental setups (e.g., batch size,\ntraining steps, and etc.) for BERT LARGE (De-\nvlin et al., 2019), XLNet LARGE (Yang et al.,\n2019), RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019), and\nELECTRALARGE (Clark et al., 2020).

C HILD -TUNING can better maintain the out-of-domain generalization ability of the model.\n3.3 Results on GLUE Benchmark\nIn this section, we show the results of four widely\nused large PLMs on four GLUE tasks: CoLA, RTE,\nMRPC, and STS-B, following Lee et al. (2020).\nBesides vanilla ﬁne-tuning, we also report the re-\nsults of two variants of CHILD -TUNING , including\nboth CHILD -TUNING F (pF = 0.2,0.3,0.4) and\nCHILD -TUNING D (pD = 0.1,0.2,0.3).\nAs Table 1 illustrates, CHILD -TUNING outper-\nforms vanilla ﬁne-tuning by a large gain across\nall the tasks on different PLMs . For instance,\nCHILD -TUNING yields an improvement of up to\n2.08 average score on XLNet, and 8.60 average\nscore on ELECTRA. Besides, the straightforward\ntask-free variant, CHILD -TUNING F, can still pro-\nvide an improvement of 0.87 average score on\nBERT and 6.27 on ELECTRA. CHILD -TUNING D,\nwhich detects child network in a task-driven way,\nis more aware of the unique characteristics of the\ndownstream task, and therefore achieves the best\nperformance, with up to 1.50 and 8.60 average\nscore improvement on BERT and ELECTRA. In\nsummary, we can come to a conclusion thatCHILD -\nTUNING is model-agnostic and can consistently\noutperform vanilla ﬁne-tuning on different PLMs.\n3.4 Probing Generalization Ability of the\nFine-tuned Model\nTo measure the generalization properties of various\nﬁne-tuning methods, in this section, we conduct\nprobing experiments from two aspects, that is, do-\nmain generalization and task generalization.\n3.4.1 Domain Generalization\nBesides boosting performance on the target down-\nstream task, we also expect CHILD -TUNING can\nhelp the ﬁne-tuned model achieve better general-\nization ability towards out-of-domain data.\nWe evaluate how well the ﬁne-tuned model gen-\neralizes to out-of-domain data based on several\nNatural Language Inference (NLI) tasks.

The model is ﬁne-tuned on MRPC task and transferred to four different\ntasks. C HILD -TUNING can maintain more generalizable representations compared with vanilla ﬁne-tuning.\nwe ﬁne-tune BERTLARGE with different strategies\non 5k subsampled MNLI and SNLI datasets re-\nspectively, and directly test the accuracy of the ﬁne-\ntuned models on other NLI datasets in different do-\nmains, including MNLI, MNLI-mismatch3, SNLI,\nSICK, SciTail, and QQP4. As Table 2 illustrates,\nCHILD -TUNING outperforms vanilla ﬁne-tuning\nacross different out-of-domain datasets. Specif-\nically, CHILD -TUNING F improves 1.11/0.35 av-\nerage score for models trained on MNLI/SNLI,\nwhile CHILD -TUNING D improves up to 1.53/0.81\naverage score. In particular, CHILD -TUNING D\nachieves 1.90 score improvement on SICK task and\n1.56 on SNLI task for models trained on MNLI.\nThe results suggest that CHILD -TUNING encour-\nages the model to learn more general semantic fea-\ntures during ﬁne-tuning, rather than some super-\nﬁcial features unique to the training data. Hence,\nthe ﬁne-tuned model can well generalize to differ-\nent datasets, even though their domains are quite\ndifferent from the dataset the model is trained on.\n3.4.2 Task Generalization\nTo justify the generalization ability of the model\nfrom another perspective, we follow the probing\nexperiments from Aghajanyan et al. (2021), which\nﬁrst freezes the representations from the model\ntrained on one task and then only trains a linear\nclassiﬁer on top of the model for another task.\nIn particular, we ﬁne-tune BERT LARGE on\nMRPC task, and transfer to four other GLUE\ntasks, i.e., CoLA, STS-B, QNLI, and QQP. As Fig-\nure 2 shows, CHILD -TUNING consistently outper-\nforms vanilla ﬁne-tuning on different transferred\ntasks. Compared with vanilla ﬁne-tuning, CHILD -\n3MNLI-m has different domain from MNLI training data.\n4The target tasks may have different label spaces and we\nintroduce the label mapping in Appendix D.\nTUNING F improves 4.58 average score (58.95 →\n63.53), while CHILD -TUNING D even gains up to\n7.06 average score improvement (58.95 →66.01).\nIn summary, ﬁne-tuning with CHILD -TUNING\ngains better performance when the ﬁne-tuned\nmodel is transferred to another task, demonstrating\nthat CHILD -TUNING can maintain more general-\nizable representations produced by the model than\nvanilla ﬁne-tuning.\n4 Analysis and Discussion\n4.1 Comparison with Prior Methods\nIn this section, we review and compare prior stud-\nies towards effective ﬁne-tuning: 1) Weight De-\ncay (Daumé III, 2007), which adds theλ∥w−w0∥2\npenalty to the loss function, where w0 denotes\nthe pretrained weights; 2) Top-K Tuning, which\nonly ﬁne-tune the top-Klayers of the model with\nother layers freezed. Houlsby et al. (2019) uses\nit as a strong baseline; 3) Mixout (Lee et al.,\n2020), which randomly replaces the parameters\nwith their pretrained weights; 4) RecAdam (Chen\net al., 2020), which is similar to Weight Decay\nwhile its loss weights λkeeps changing during ﬁne-\ntuning; 5) Robust Representations through Regular-\nized Finetuning (R3F) (Aghajanyan et al., 2021),\nwhich is rooted in trust region theory. Appendix C\nshows detailed hyperparameter settings.\nWe compare CHILD -TUNING with these meth-\nods based on BERT LARGE, and report the mean\n(max) score results in Table 3, following Lee et al.\n(2020). While all the ﬁne-tuning methods can bring\nimprovements across four different tasks compared\nwith vanilla ﬁne-tuning, CHILD -TUNING achieves\nthe best performance. In detail, among prior ﬁne-\ntuning methods, Mixout and R3F yield the highest\nimprovement with 0.84 and 0.88 average score re-\n9520\nMethods CoLA RTE MRPC STS-B Avg ∆\nVanilla Fine-tuning† 60.60 ( – ) 70.40 ( – ) 88.00 ( – ) 90.00 ( – ) 77.25 –\nVanilla Fine-tuning 63.13 (64.31) 70.18 (72.56) 90.77 (91.42) 89.61 (90.12) 78.42 0.00\nWeight Decay (Daumé III, 2007) 63.63 (64.56) 71.99 (74.37) 90.93 (91.70) 89.82 (90.29) 79.09 +0.67\nTop-KTuning (Houlsby et al., 2019) 62.63 (64.06) 70.90 (74.73) 91.09 (92.20) 89.97 (90.15) 78.65 +0.23\nMixout (Lee et al., 2020) 63.60 (64.82) 72.15 (75.45) 91.29 (91.85) 89.99 (90.13) 79.26 +0.84\nRecAdam (Chen et al., 2020) 64.33 (65.33) 71.63 (73.29) 90.85 (92.01) 89.86 (90.42) 79.17 +0.75\nR3F (Aghajanyan et al., 2021) 64.13 (66.32) 72.28 (74.73) 91.18 (91.57) 89.61 (90.12) 79.30 +0.88\nCHILD-TUNINGF 63.71 (66.06) 72.06 (74.73) 91.22 (91.85)90.18 (90.92) 79.29 +0.87\nCHILD-TUNINGD 64.92 (66.03) 73.14 (76.17) 91.42 (92.17) 90.18 (90.64) 79.92 +1.50\nCHILD-TUNINGD+ R3F 65.18 (66.03) 73.43 (76.17) 92.23 (92.65) 90.18 (90.64)∗ 80.26 +1.84\nTable 3: Comparison between CHILD -TUNING with other ﬁne-tuning methods. We report the mean (max) re-\nsults of 10 random seeds. Results with †are taken from Yang et al. (2019), and others are from our implementation.\nThe task-driven variant, CHILD -TUNING D, achieves the best performance compared with other methods. Integrat-\ning C HILD -TUNING D with other ﬁne-tuning methods like R3F can yield further improvements. Note that since\nR3F is not applicable to regression task, the result on STS-B (marked with ∗) is the same as CHILD -TUNING D.\nDataset Vanilla C.T UNINGF C.TUNINGD\nCoLA 47.48 48.44 50.37\nRTE 65.09 65.52 68.09\nMRPC 84.91 85.44 86.49\nSTS-B 81.86 82.25 82.76\nSST2 90.25 90.34 90.39\nQNLI 81.68 83.09 83.42\nQQP 71.30 72.15 71.79\nMNLI 55.72 62.47 62.93\nAvg 72.29 73.71 74.53\nTable 4: Results in low-resource scenarios .

CHILD -TUNING F has performance on\npar with Mixout and R3F, while CHILD -TUNING D\nachieves 1.50 average score improvement in total.\nMore importantly, CHILD -TUNING is ﬂexible and\northogonal to most ﬁne-tuning methods. Thus, in-\ntegrating CHILD -TUNING with other methods can\nfurther boost the performance. For instance, com-\nbining CHILD -TUNING D with R3F leads to a 1.84\naverage score improvement in total.\nIn short, compared with prior ﬁne-tuning meth-\nods, we ﬁnd that 1) CHILD -TUNING is more effec-\ntive in adapting PLMs to various tasks, especially\nfor the task-driven variant CHILD -TUNING D, and\n2) CHILD -TUNING has the advantage that it is ﬂex-\nible enough to integrate with other methods to po-\ntentially achieve further improvements.\n4.2 Results in Low-resource Scenarios\nFine-tuning a large pretrained model on extremely\nsmall datasets can be very challenging since the\nrisk of overﬁtting rises (Dodge et al., 2020). Thus,\nin this section, we explore the effect of CHILD -\nTUNING with only a few training examples. To this\nend, we downsample all datasets in GLUE to 1k\ntraining examples and ﬁne-tune BERT LARGE on\nthem.\nAs Table 4 demonstrates, compared with vanilla\nﬁne-tuning, CHILD -TUNING F improves the aver-\nage score by 1.42, and the improvement is even\nlarger for CHILD -TUNING D, which is up to 2.24.\nIt suggests that although overﬁtting is quite se-\nvere when the training data is in extreme low-\nresource scenarios, CHILD -TUNING can still ef-\nfectively improve the model performance, espe-\ncially for CHILD -TUNING D since it decreases the\nhypothesis space of the model.\n4.3 What is the Difference Between\nCHILD -TUNING and Model Pruning?\nCHILD -TUNING D detects the most important child\nnetwork in a task-driven way, and only updates\nthis parameters within the child network during\nthe ﬁne-tuning with other parameters freezed. It is\nvery likely to be confused with model pruning (Li\net al., 2017; Zhu and Gupta, 2018; Lin et al., 2020),\nwhich also detects a subnetwork within the model\n(but then removes the other parameters).\nActually, CHILD -TUNING and model pruning\nare different in both the objectives and methods .\nRegarding objectives, model pruning aims at im-\nproving the inference efﬁciency and maintaining\n9521\nMethods CoLA RTE MRPC STS-B\nVanilla 63.13 70.18 90.77 89.61\nPrune 0.00 51.12 81.40 45.63\nRandom 63.23 70.69 90.83 89.67\nLowest Info. 60.33 59.86 83.82 88.52\nC.TUNINGD 64.92 72.78 91.26 90.18\nTable 5: Ablation study of CHILD -TUNING D.

Regrad-\ning methods, model pruning abandons the unimpor-\ntant parameters during inference, while the param-\neters that do not belong to the child network are\nstill reserved for CHILD -TUNING during training\nand inference. In this way, the knowledge of the\nnon-child network hidden in the pretrained weights\nwill be fully utilized.\nTo better illustrate the effectiveness of CHILD -\nTUNING D compared to model pruning, we set all\nthe parameters not belonging to the child network\nto zero, which is referred to as Prune in Table 5.\nIt shows that, once we abandon parameters out\nof the child network, the score dramatically de-\ncreases by 33.89 points averaged on four tasks\n(CoLA/RTE/MRPC/STS-B), and the model even\ncollapses on CoLA task. It also suggests that be-\nsides parameters in child network, those in the non-\nchild network are also necessary since they can\nprovide general knowledge learned in pretraining.\n4.4 Is the Task-Driven Child Network Really\nthat Important to the Target Task?\nCHILD -TUNING D detects the task-speciﬁc child\nnetwork by means of choosing parameters with the\nhighest Fisher information towards the downstream\ntask data. In this section, we exlore whether the\ndetected task-driven child network is really that\nimportant to the task.\nTo this end, we introduce two ablation studies\nfor CHILD -TUNING D: 1) Random: We randomly\nchoose a child network and keep it unchanged dur-\ning ﬁne-tuning; 2) Lowest Info.: We choose those\nparameters with lowest Fisher information as the\nchild network, contrasted to the highest Fisher in-\nCoLA RTE MRPCSTS-BMNLI QNLI QQP\nRTE\nMRPC\nSTS-B\nMNLI\nQNLI\nQQP\nSST2\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n0.55\n0.60\nFigure 3: The overlapping ratio among task-driven\nchild networks among GLUE tasks.\nformation adopted in CHILD -TUNING D.\nAs shown in Table 5, choosing the child network\nrandomly can even outperform vanilla ﬁne-tuning,\nwith 0.18 average score improvement. It supports\nour claim that there is no need to update all pa-\nrameters of the large PLMs, and decreasing the\nhypothesis space can reduce the risk of overﬁtting.\nHowever, it is still worth ﬁnding a proper child\nnetwork to further boost the performance. If we\nchoose parameters with the lowest Fisher infor-\nmation (Lowest Fisher), the average score is dra-\nmatically decreased by 6.65 compared with choos-\ning with the highest Fisher information adopted in\nCHILD -TUNING D. Hence, we can conclude that\nthe child network detected by CHILD -TUNING D is\nindeed important to the downstream task.\n4.5 What is the Relationship among Child\nNetworks for Different Tasks?\nAs the task-driven child networks are correlated\nwith the tasks, we further explore the relationship\namong child networks for different tasks. To this\nend, we visualize the overlapping rate among dif-\nferent task-driven child networks, where we use the\nJaccard similarity coefﬁcient, |Ci∩Cj|\n|Ci∪Cj|, to calculate\nthe overlapping rate between task iand j.\nFigure 3 shows the overlap among GLUE tasks.\nAs we expected, similar tasks tend to have higher\noverlapping ratios of child network. For example,\nthe overlapping ratio among NLI tasks is remark-\nably higher than others, such as RTE and QNLI,\nQNLI and MNLI. For different kinds of tasks, their\noverlapping ratio is relatively lower, such as CoLA\nand MRPC. It is also interesting to ﬁnd that the\ntask-driven child network for SST2 overlaps less\nwith other tasks except CoLA, even though SST2\n9522\nand CoLA is not so similar. The reason may be that\nboth SST2 and CoLA belongs to a single sentence\nclassiﬁcation task, while others are in a different\nformat of sentence-pair classiﬁcation tasks.\n5 Related Work\nExplosion of PLMs. There has been an explo-\nsion of studies on Pretrained Language Models\n(PLMs). Devlin et al. (2019) propose BERT that is\npretrained on large quantities of unannotated cor-\npus with self-supervised tasks. Many PLMs also\nemerged such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2018), GPT-\n3 (Brown et al., 2020), ELECTRA (Clark et al.,\n2020), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu\net al., 2019), and BART (Lewis et al., 2020). The\nnumber of parameters of PLMs also explodes.\nBERTLARGE has 340 millions of parameters, and\nthe number for GPT-3 is even up to 175 billions.\nEffective and generalizable ﬁne-tuning. With\na mass of parameters, ﬁne-tuning large PLMs tend\nto achieve degenerated performance due to overﬁt-\nting and have poor generalization ability, especially\non small datasets (Devlin et al., 2019; Phang et al.,\n2018; Lee et al., 2020). Therefore, different ﬁne-\ntuning techniques have been proposed. Some of\nthem utilize the pretrained weights to regularize the\ndeviation of the ﬁne-tuned model (Lee et al., 2020;\nDaumé III, 2007; Chen et al., 2020), while others\ncompress the output information (Mahabadi et al.,\n2021) or injects noise into the input (Jiang et al.,\n2020; Aghajanyan et al., 2021). Moreover, Zhang\net al. (2021) and Mosbach et al. (2021) point out\nthat the omission of bias correction in the Adam\noptimizer used in Devlin et al. (2019) is also re-\nsponsible for the degenerated results.\nOrthogonal to these methods, CHILD -TUNING\naddress the problems by detecting the child net-\nwork within the model in a task-free or task-driven\nway. It only updates parameters within the child\nnetwork via a gradient mask, which is proved to be\neffective in adapting large PLMs to various tasks,\nalong with better generalization ability.\nParameter-efﬁcient Fine-tuning. There are\nalso studies focusing on parameter-efﬁcient\nﬁne-tuning, for example, the adapter-based\nmethods (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al.,\n2020; Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021), and the\nDiff-Pruning method (Guo et al., 2021). However,\nour CHILD -TUNING is different from this line\nof works. Firstly, they aim at ﬁne-tuning as few\nas possible parameters to maintain performance,\nwhile we target effective and generalizable\nﬁne-tuning. Secondly, Diff-Pruning sparsiﬁes\ndiff-vector with gradient estimators, and adapter-\nbased methods ﬁne-tune new added module\nduring training, while we detect the child network\ninside the model without extra parameters and\nonly need to calculate the FIM before training\nfor CHILD -TUNING D. Finally, we consistently\noutperform vanilla ﬁne-tuning by a large margin,\nwhile they achieve competitive performance with\nfull model training.\n6 Conclusion\nTo mitigate the overﬁtting problem and improve\ngeneralization for ﬁne-tuning large-scale PLMs, we\npropose a straightforward yet effective ﬁne-tuning\ntechnique, CHILD -TUNING , which only updates\nthe child network during ﬁne-tuning via strategi-\ncally masking out the gradients of the non-child\nnetwork. Two variants are introduced, CHILD -\nTUNING F and CHILD -TUNING D, which detect the\nchild network in a task-free and task-driven way, re-\nspectively. Extensive experiments on various down-\nstream tasks show that both of them can outperform\nvanilla ﬁne-tuning and prior works by large gains\namong four different pretrained language models,\nand meanwhile largely enhance the generalization\nability of the ﬁne-tuned models. Since CHILD -\nTUNING is orthogonal to most prior ﬁne-tuning\ntechniques, integrating CHILD -TUNING with them\ncan further boost the performance.\nAcknowledgments\nThis paper is supported by the National Key\nResearch and Development Program of China\nunder Grant No. 2020AAA0106700, the Na-\ntional Science Foundation of China under Grant\nNo.61936012 and 61876004.\nReferences\nArmen Aghajanyan, Akshat Shrivastava, Anchit Gupta,\nNaman Goyal, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Sonal Gupta.\n2021.

However, there are some\nissues with the construction of the WNLI dataset5.\nTherefore most studies exclude this dataset (De-\nvlin et al., 2019; Dodge et al., 2020) and we follow\nthem. The metrics we report for each dataset are\nalso illustrated in Table 6.\nB Settings for Different Pretrained\nLanguage Models\nIn this paper, we ﬁne-tune different large pretrained\nlanguage models with CHILD -TUNING , including\nBERTLARGE6, XLNetLARGE7, RoBERTaLARGE8,\n5https://gluebenchmark.com/faq\n6https://huggingface.co/\nbert-large-cased/tree/main\n7https://huggingface.co/\nxlnet-large-cased/tree/main\n8https://huggingface.co/roberta-large/\ntree/main\n9525\nDataset #Train #Dev Metrics\nSingle-sentence Tasks\nCoLA 8.5k 1.0k Matthews Corr\nSST-2 67k 872 Accuracy\nInference\nRTE 2.5k 277 Accuracy\nQNLI 105k 5.5k Accuracy\nMNLI 393k 9.8k Accuracy\nSimilarity and Paraphrase\nMRPC 3.7k 408 F1\nSTS-B 5.7k 1.5k Spearman Corr\nQQP 364k 40k F1\nTable 6: Statistics and metrics of eight datasets used in\nthis paper form GLUE benchmark.\nand ELECTRALARGE9. The training epochs/steps,\nbatch size, and warmup steps are listed in Ta-\nble 7. We use AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter,\n2019) optimizer, and set β1 = 0 .9, β2 = 0 .999,\nϵ = 1 e-6. We clip the gradients with a maxi-\nmum norm of 1, and the maximum sequence length\nis set as 128. For CHILD -TUNING F, we uses\npF = {0.2,0.3,0.4}and re-scale the gradients to\nensure the gradients after CHILD -TUNING F are\nunbiased. For CHILD -TUNING D, we use pD =\n{0.1,0.2,0.3}. We use grid search for learning\nrate from {1e-5,2e-5,..., 1e-4}. We conduct all\nthe experiments on a single GTX-3090 GPU.\nThese pretrained models are all Transformer-\nbased. XLNet (Yang et al., 2019) is an autore-\ngressive pretrained language model with token per-\nmutations. It generates tokens in an autoregressive\nway while can still capture bidirectional context\ninformation. RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) is a ro-\nbustly optimized version of BERT. It uses a dy-\nnamic masking mechanism, larger batch size, and\nlonger training times, and it also abandons the next\nsentence prediction task. ELECTRA (Clark et al.,\n2020) pretrains the model with a generator and\na discriminator. The discriminator is trained to\ndistinguish whether the token is generated by the\ngenerator or the original token.\n9https://huggingface.co/google/\nelectra-large-discriminator/tree/main\nC Settings for Other Fine-tuning\nMethods\nWe compare Child-tuning with several other regu-\nlarization approaches in our paper. In this section,\nwe simply introduce these approaches and their\nhyperparameters settings.\nWeight Decay Daumé III (2007) proposes to\nadds a penalty item to the loss function to regu-\nlate the L2 distance between ﬁne-tuned models and\nthe pretrained models. Therefore, the loss function\nis as follows:\nL(w) = LCE(w) + λWD∥w −w0∥2]\nWe grid search the optimal λWD from{\n10,1,10−1,10−2,10−3,10−4}\n.\nTop-K Fine-tuning Top-K Fine-tuning is a\ncommon method and Houlsby et al. (2019) uses it\nas a strong baseline. Top-KFine-tuning only updat-\ness the top K layers along with the classiﬁcation\nlayer, while freezing all the other bottom layers.\nWe grid search the optimal Kfrom {0,3,6,12}in\nour paper.\nMixout Lee et al. (2020) randomly replace\nthe parameters with its pretrained weights with a\ncertainly probability pduring ﬁne-tuning, which\naims to minimize the deviation of the ﬁne-\ntuned model towards the pretrained weights. In\nour paper, we grid search the optimal p from\n{0.1,0.2,..., 0.8}. We use the implementa-\ntion in https://github.com/bloodwass/\nmixout.\nRecAdam Chen et al. (2020) proposes a new\noptimizer RecAdam for ﬁne-tuning, which can be\nconsidered as an advanced version of Weight De-\ncay, because the coefﬁcient of two different loss\nitems are changed as the training progresses. The\nfollowing equations demonstrate the new loss func-\ntion, where kand t0 are controlling hyperparame-\nters and tis the current training step.\nL(w) = λRec(t)LCE(w)\n+ (1 −λRec(t))∥w −w0∥2\nλRec(t) = 1\n1 + exp(−k·(t−t0))\nWe grid search thekfrom {0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5,1.0},\nand t0 from {50,100,250,500}.

These settings are reported in\nthe their ofﬁcial repository for best practice.\nRobust Representations through Regularized\nFine-tuning (R3F) Aghajanyan et al. (2021)\npropose R3F for ﬁne-tuning based on trust region\ntheory, which adds noise into the sequence input\nembedding and tries to minimize the symmetrical\nKL divergence between probability distributions\ngiven original input and noisy input. The loss func-\ntion of R3F is as follows:\nL(w) = LCE(w) + λR3FKLS(f(x)||f(x+ z))\ns.t. z ∼N(0,σ2I) or z ∼U(−σ,σ)\nwhere f(·) denotes the model and z denotes\nthe noise sampled from either normal distribu-\ntion or uniform distribution controlled by hyper-\nparameter σ, and KLS(x||y) = KL(x||y) +\nKL(y||x). We use both normal and unform\ndistribution, λR3F = 1 , and grid search the σ\nfrom {0.1,0.5,1.0,5.0}. We use the implemen-\ntation in https://github.com/pytorch/\nfairseq/tree/master/examples/rxf.\nD Label Mapping in Task Generalization\nMNLI and SNLI datasets contain three labels, i.e.,\nentailment, neutral, and contradiction. For SciTail,\nit only has two labels, entailment and neutral, and\ntherefore we map both neutral and contradiction in\nsource label space to neutral in target label space\nfollowing Mahabadi et al. (2021). For QQP, it\nhas two labels, duplicate and not duplicate, and\nGong et al. (2018) interpret them as entailment and\nneutral respectively. We follow Gong et al. (2018)\nand use the same mapping strategy as SciTail.\nE Theoretical Details\nWe theoretically justify the effectiveness ofCHILD -\nTUNING F. Assume CHILD -TUNING F reserves\ngradients with probability pF ∈(0,1], and we sim-\nply use p to denote pF in the following content.\nTheorem 1 shows the variance of gradients is a\nstrictly decreasing function ofp. When p= 1, it de-\ngenerates into normal ﬁne-tuning methods. There-\nfore, CHILD -TUNING F can improve the variance\nof the gradients of the model. Next, Theorem 2\nshows that with higher variance, the model can\nconverge to more ﬂat local minima (smaller ρin\nTheorem 2). Inspired by studies that show ﬂat min-\nima tends to generalize better (Keskar et al., 2017;\nSun et al., 2020; Foret et al., 2021), we can further\nprove CHILD -TUNING F decreases the generaliza-\ntion error bound.\nTheorem 1. Suppose Ldenotes the loss function\non the parameter w, for multiple data instances in\nthe training set x ∼S, the gradients obey a Gaus-\nsian distribution N( ∂L\n∂w,σ2\ngIk). For a randomly\nsampled batch B ∼S, when the learning algo-\nrithm is SGD with learning rate η, the reserving\nprobability of the CHILD -TUNING F is p, then the\n9527\nmean and covariance of the update ∆w are,\nE[∆w] = −η∂L\n∂w (11)\nΣ[∆w] = η2σ2\ngIk\np|B| + (1 −p)η2diag{∂L\n∂w}2\np\n(12)\nwhere Σ is the covariance matrix and diag (x) is\nthe diagonal matrix of the vector x.\nSpecially, when w is a local minima, E[∆w] =\n0k,Σ[∆w] = σ2Ik and σ2 =\nη2σ2\ng\np|B| is a strictly\ndecreasing function of p.\nTheorem 2. Suppose Ldenotes the expected error\nrate loss function; w0 denotes the pretrained pa-\nrameter; kis the number of parameters; w denotes\nthe local minima the algorithm converges to; H is\nthe Hessian matrix on w and ρis its greatest eigen-\nvalue; Fk is the cumulative distribution function of\nthe χ2(k) distribution.\nIf the next update of the algorithm ∆w ∼\nN(0k,σ2Ik) and the training loss increases more\nthan ϵwith probability δ, we assume the algorithm\nwill escape the local minima w. When the follow-\ning bound holds, the algorithm can converge to the\nlocal minima w, with higher order inﬁnity omitted,\nρ≤ 2ϵ\nF−1\nk (1 −δ)σ2 (13)\nSuppose the prior over parameters after training\nis P = N(w0,σ2\n0Ik), the following generalization\nerror bound holds with probability 1- δ over the\nchoice of training set S∼D ,\nbound(w) ≤(kσ2\n0 −∥w −w0∥2)ϵ\nkF−1\nk (1 −δ)σ2 + R (14)\nwhere bound(w) = LS(w) −LD(w), R =√\nklog\n(\n1+\nk∥w−w0∥2\n2\nkσ2\n0−∥w−w0∥2\n(\n1+\n√\nlog |S|\nk\n)2)\n+4 log|S|\nδ\n2(|S|−1) ,\nwith higher order inﬁnity omitted.\nE.1 Proof of Theorem 1\nProof. Suppose g(i) is the gradient of data instance\nx(i),(1 ≤ i ≤ |B|), then g(i) ∼ N( ∂L\n∂w,σ2\ngIk).\nThen, deﬁne g =\n|B|∑\ni=1\ng(i)\n|B|, we have\n∆w = −η\n|B|∑\ni=1\ng(i)\n|B|⊙M = −ηg ⊙M (15)\nConsider g, we have\nE[g] = ∂L\n∂w,Σ[g] = σ2\ngIk\n|B| (16)\nSuppose ˆ g= g\np ⊙M, therefore,\nE[ˆ g] = p\np ×∂L\n∂w = ∂L\n∂w (17)\nSuppose ˆgi,gi are the i-th dimension of ˆ g,g, we\nhave\nD[ˆgi] = E[ˆg2\ni] −(E[ˆgi])2 (18)\n= pE[(gi\np)2] −(E[ˆgi])2 (19)\n= E[g2\ni]\np −(E[ˆgi])2 (20)\n= (E[gi])2 + D[gi]\np −(E[ˆgi])2 (21)\n= D[gi]\np + (1 −p)(E[ˆgi])2\np (22)\nTherefore,\nΣ[ˆ g] = σ2\ngIk\np|B|+ (1 −p)diag{E[g]}2\np (23)\nTherefore,\nE[∆w] = −η∂L\n∂w (24)\nΣ[∆w] = η2σ2\ngIk\np|B| + (1 −p)η2diag{∂L\n∂w}2\np\n(25)\nSpecially, when w is a local minima, ∂L\n∂w =\n0k. Therefore, E[∆w] = 0k,Σ[∆w] = σ2Ik\nand σ2 =\nη2σ2\ng\np|B| is a strictly decreasing function of\np.\nE.2 Proof of Theorem 2\nProof. We ﬁrst prove Eq. 13. Apply a Taylor ex-\npansion on training loss L, notice that ∇wL(w) =\n0k since w is a local minima. When the algorithm\ncan escape the local minima w, with higher order\ninﬁnity omitted, we have,\nϵ≤L(w + v) −L(w) (26)\n=vT∇wL(w) + 1\n2vTHv + o(∥v∥2\n2) (27)\n≤ρ∥v∥2\n2\n2 + o(∥v∥2\n2) = ρ∥v∥2\n2\n2 (28)\n9528\nIf the probability of escaping, Pesc, we have\nPesc = P(L(w + ∆w) −L(w) ≥ϵ) (29)\n≤P(ρ∥∆w∥2\n2\n2 ≥ϵ) (30)\n= P(∥∆w\nσ ∥2\n2 ≥ 2ϵ\nρσ2 ) (31)\nnamely, P(∥∆w\nσ ∥2\n2 ≤ 2ϵ\nρσ2 ) ≤1 −Pesc.\nSince ∆w\nσ ∼N(0k,Ik), ∥∆w\nσ ∥2\n2 ∼χ2(k), we\nhave,\nP(∥∆w\nσ ∥2\n2 ≤ 2ϵ\nρσ2 ) = Fk( 2ϵ\nρσ2 ) (32)\nwhen Eq. 13 holds,\nP(∥∆w\nσ ∥2\n2 ≤ 2ϵ\nρσ2 ) = Fk( 2ϵ\nρσ2 ) (33)\n≥Fk(F−1\nk (1 −δ)) = 1 −δ (34)\nTherefore, Pesc ≤1 −P(∥∆w\nσ ∥2\n2 ≤ 2ϵ\nρσ2 ) ≤δ.\nThe algorithm will not escape the local minima w\nand can converge to the local minima w.\nTo prove Eq. 14, we introduce Lemma 1 in pa-\nper Foret et al. (2021), which is Theorem 2 in the\npaper.\nLemma 1. Suppose d > 0, the prior over pa-\nrameters is P = N(wP,σ2\nPIk) and σ2\nP = d2 +\n∥w−wP∥2\nk , the following bound holds with proba-\nbility 1-δover the choice of training set S∼D ,\nLD(w) ≤ max\n∥∆w∥2≤d\nLS(w + ∆w) + R (35)\nwhere k denotes the number of parameters and\nR =\n√\nklog\n(\n1+\n∥w−wP∥2\n2\nd2\n(\n1+\n√\nlog |S|\nk\n)2)\n+4 log|S|\nδ\n2(|S|−1) ,\nwith higher order inﬁnity omitted.\nIn Lemma 1, when we set wP = w0 and\nσP = σ0, we have d2 = σ2\n0 −∥w−w0∥2\nk and R=√\nklog\n(\n1+\nk∥w−w0∥2\n2\nkσ2\n0−∥w−w0∥2\n(\n1+\n√\nlog |S|\nk\n)2)\n+4 log|S|\nδ\n2(|S|−1) .\nWith higher order inﬁnity omitted, we have\nmax\n∥∆w∥2≤d\nLS(w + ∆w) = LS(w) + ρd2\n2 (36)\n≤(kσ2\n0 −∥w −w0∥2)ϵ\nkF−1\nk (1 −δ)σ2 (37)\nTherefore, the following generalization error\nbound holds,\nbound(w) ≤(kσ2\n0 −∥w −w0∥2)ϵ\nkF−1\nk (1 −δ)σ2 + R (38)\nwhere higher order inﬁnity is omitted and R=√\nklog\n(\n1+\nk∥w−w0∥2\n2\nkσ2\n0−∥w−w0∥2\n(\n1+\n√\nlog |S|\nk\n)2)\n+4 log|S|\nδ\n2(|S|−1) .",
