  "abstract": "Abstract The 2 × 2 couplers, as a demodulation core of the fibre optic sensing system, have been extensively employed in fibre optic sensors for partial discharge (PD) detection of power equipment. However, the unstable demodulation sensitivity and low signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR) of such a system are still unsatisfactory in engineering. This work uses a distributed feedback fibre laser as the sensor and employs a common asymmetric 2 × 3 coupler instead of a 2 × 2 coupler as the demodulation core to design a PD detection system. Then, we propose a new demodulation method for PD acoustic emission signals based on the Naval Postgraduate School method. On the PD detection platform, the performance of the conventional detection system and the proposed system is compared. The experimental results show that the proposed system has better reliability and can identify the PD signals in all instances. Furthermore, the average SNR of the new demodulation method is 6.11 dB higher than the traditional 2 × 2 coupler system and can be extended to most PD detection systems using fibre optic sensors.",
