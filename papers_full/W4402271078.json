  "abstract": "Background: Advancements in genomic technologies are rapidly evolving, with the potential to transform laboratory diagnostics by enabling high-throughput analysis of complex biological data, such as microbiome data. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in extracting actionable insights from vast datasets, but their application in generating microbiome findings reports with clinical interpretations and lifestyle recommendations has not been explored yet. Methods: This article introduces an innovative framework that utilizes LLMs to automate the generation of findings reports in the context of microbiome diagnostics. The proposed model integrates LLMs within an event-driven, workflow-based architecture, designed to enhance scalability and adaptability in clinical laboratory environments. Special focus is given to aligning the model with clinical standards and regulatory guidelines such as the In-Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (IVDR) and the guidelines published by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG AI). The implementation of this model was demonstrated through a prototype called “MicroFlow”. Results: The implementation of MicroFlow indicates the viability of automating findings report generation using LLMs. Initial evaluation by laboratory expert users indicated that the integration of LLMs is promising, with the generated reports being plausible and useful, although further testing on real-world data is necessary to assess the model’s accuracy and reliability. Conclusions: This work presents a potential approach for using LLMs to support the generation of findings reports in microbiome diagnostics. While the initial results seem promising, further evaluation and refinement are needed to ensure the model’s effectiveness and adherence to clinical standards. Future efforts will focus on improvements based on feedback from laboratory experts and comprehensive testing on real patient data.",
