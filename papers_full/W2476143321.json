INTRODUCTION \nAccording to ANSI/IEEE C57.117-1986 [1], a transformer \nis a static electric device consisting of a winding or two, or more \ncoupled windings, with a magnetic core for introducing mutual \ncoupling between electric circuits  through electromagnetic \ninduction.  \nThe transformer includes all transformer -related \ncomponents, such as bu shings, load tap changers, fans, \ntemperature gauges, etc., and excludes all system- related \ncomponents (e.g. surge arresters, grounding resistors, high -\nvoltage switches, low -voltage switches and house service \nequipment).  \nTransformers can be classified into many types such as \npower transformers, autotransformers, regulating transformers, \netc. Based on their application, transformers are classified into \nsubstation transformers, transmission tie transformers, unit \ntransformers, etc. The study reported in this paper considers 220 \nkV power transformers for utility applications.  \nTransformers have a key  role in power systems and their \nreliability directly affects the reliability of the whole network. \nOutage of transformers is considered a failure, since it is an event \nthat determines a fault state (the transformer cannot perform its \nspecified function) [1].  \nGenerally, t ransformer outages a re either forced or \nscheduled, and both are done by means of switching operations. \nForced outages  of transformers are mainly due to automatic \nswitching operations performed by protection \nsystems [2], [3], [4]. They are caused by either external (such as \ntransmission line faults) or internal causes (such as core failure \nand winding failure). In [3] and [4] more details about failure \nstatistics of transformer subassemblies  are given . For the \npurpose of abbreviation in this paper, the term ‘outage’ will refer \nto ‘forced outage’. \nTransformers outages are classified according to their \noperating voltage level in the network. In this paper the 220 kV \nvoltage level was selected, because it is considered one of the  \noldest transmission networks in many European \ncountries[5], [6]. For instance, the generation plants in Germany \nare linked to the unified Grid through 220 kV level [7]. In both \nRomania and Switzerland, the 220 kV system is considered the \nbackbone of transmission network [8],[9].  \nSince large groups of transformers operating in the world \nhave already exceeded 30-year exploitation period [25], in the \nliterature several surveys highligh ting the outage causes of \ntransformers can be found . A ten  years survey by a CIGRÉ \nworking group, on internal failures in large substation utility \ntransformers [2] pointed out that about 41 % of failures were due \nto on-load tap changers (OLTC) and about 19 % were due to the \nwindings. The number of transformers, under investigation, with \non load tap changer was 15786 unit ∙years and voltage level \nranges from 100 kV to 300 kV. The total numbers of failures \nwere 370 during the study period 1968 -1978. Fig. 1 shows the \npercentage failure distribution for power transformers with on -\nload tap changers [2]. \n \nFig. 1. Percentage failure of power transformers (CIGRE survey). \nTransformer internal failure data analysis in South Africa in \nthe period 1985 -1995 is presented in [3]. The failure analysis \nwas based on 188 outages of transformers with a rated voltage \nranging from 88 kV to 765 kV and rated power from 20 to 800 \nMVA. Considering 100 -400MVA transformers, the total \nnumber of failures for general ageing, core  problems, \nlighting/switching, others, short circuit, and tap changers were \n15, 8, 2, 15, 1, and 5 respectively. In 2006 this investigation was \nextended for units failing in the period 1996 to 2006, and was \nbased on failure study of step -up generator, transmission and \n21ISBN 978-972-8954-42-0 | http://dx.doi.org/10.14195/978-972-8954-42-0_4\ndistribution transformer failures. Bushings, tap changers and \nwindings represent about 79% of outage causes during this study \nperiod. The contribution of core related failures was 2% only [4]. \nAnother study  was done on 50 outages of 500 transformers \nwith rated power ranging from 14MVA to 175 MVA [19]. Tap \nchanger and bushing failure were the dominant causes of outage \nfor transformers having a rated voltage ranging from 110 to 150 \nkV. In [20] the failure statistics of transformers in Thailand was \nstudied by considering the scattering  of history data. The data \nwere collected from 44 transformers with rated voltage of \n230/115/22 kV with total 68 minor failures. The failure \nstatistical analysis shows that  other failure  was the highest , \n41.3%, followed by bushing , 31.7%, t ap changer , 17.5%, \nleakage 7.9 %  and winding 1.6%. Outage data analysis for \npower transformers in Egypt over the period 2002 -2009 is \npresented in [21], [22], [23], [9].  \nTABLE I.

Major failures, those  that are \nsevere and require the removal of transformer to be reprocessed \nunder factory conditions or its replacement. Minor failures can \nbe repair on site. An overall view on general outage causes of \ntransformers, according to previous surveys, is shown in Table \n1. The others outage causes ar e related to over flux tripping, \ncircuit breaker failure, low oil level, etc. \nThis paper is organized as follows, in section II the \nqualitative and quantitative failure modes and effect analysis \n(FMEA and FMECA) is discussed, while in section III FMEA \non power transformers is reported. \nII. FMECA  \nIEC-60182 [10] defines FMEA as a systematic procedure for \nthe analysis of a system which target is the identification of the \npotential failure modes, their causes and effects on system \nperformance. It is a bottom up failure analysis method that \nhighlights common failure causes of the system and provide a \nrank for each failure mode related to element importance. \nAdditionally, it focuses on system parts and/or functions that are \nmost likely to fail. MIL -Std-1629A [11] consideres the \nusefulness of the FMEA as a reliability tool during design phase \nfor decision making process upon the effectiveness of system \nfunctional failures and problems information. On other hand, \nTM 5-698-4 standard [12] and ANSI/IEEE std. 352 [13] depict \nthe importance of FMEA for safety analysis, maintainability \nplan analysis and failure detection.  \nFMEA should include a list of equipment failure modes, like \nthat shown in table 1, reasons of these failures, local effects that \nrefer to the consequences of each possible failure on the system \nelement, final effects that describe the impact of that possible \nfailures on the whole system, an alternative provision or \nrecommended correc tive actions to avoid these \nfailures [10], [11], [12], [13]. Finally, a critically analysis (CA) \nallowing to assign a Risk Priority Number (RPN) to each failure \nmode must be done: \nRPN=S×O×D                (1) \nwhere S (Severity) represents the severity on the base of  the \nassessment of the worst potential consequences resulting from \nan item failure, O (Occurrence) denotes the probability of failure \nmode occurrence and D (Detection) represents the chance t o \nidentify and eliminate the failure before the system or customer \nis affected. Fig. 2 shows a schematic diagram of the necessary \nsteps to carry out both FMEA and CA. \nIn this way the definition of RPN allows to introduce the \ncriticality of outages (FMECA).  The criteria for selecting \nseverity, occurrence, and detection values depends on \nstandards [10], [11], [12]. In this paper, an analysis based on \nIEC-60182 evaluation criteria, as shown in TABLE II. is applied \nto power transformers. \n \n \nFig. 2 Schematic Diagram of FMECA \n \nCOIMBRA 2014\nMPMM\n Maintenance Performance \n Measurement and Management\n22\nMohamed Khalil; Loredana Cristaldi; Marco Faifer\n \nTABLE II.

FMECA FOR 220 KV TRANSFORMERS \nThe FMECA of functional/components minor and major failures of in-service transformers are estimated in Table III and Table \nIV respectively. In these table s attention is given to all possible major and minor failures that might result in interruption of \ntransformer service. The impact of minor failures are not significant on transformer life. Therefore, the final effects of minor failures \nare interpreted in terms of transformer repair time duration. However, the frequent over current outages  in the long run , resulting \nfrom overloading, lead to insulation degradation over time  [14]. Also operation of Buchholz and pressure relief gives a strong \nindication to high percentage of combustion gases that are considered the catalyst agent for transformer ageing [15]. \nAs reported in Table III overcurrent outages scores the highest RPN. Nowadays, the goal for the majority of transmission dispatch \ncenters is the operation of transformers within IEC-60354 loading limit [16]. However, their ultimate challenge is the rapid growth \nof loads. Consequently, transformers are tripped frequently by overcurrent protection. \nOn other hand , earth fault and differential protection have the same high RPN. Their occurrence represent a hazard for th e \ntransformer operation. Generally, the low voltage side of 220 kV transformers feed medium level transformers, 132kV, 66 kV, or 33 \nkV, and they are quite far from the unbalance in the distribution system. Therefore, the activation of earth fault protection in 220 kV \nrequires more attention and investigation for recognizing the fault nature. The differential protection operates if there is a disturbance \nin the protection zone, its operation gives a strong indication to utilities for a serious hazard within this zone. This will require site \ntests for the transformer including gas analysis. Buchholz and pressure relief are utterly similar to differential protection, its protective \nzone is limited to the transformer body.  \nOutage of incomers is a source of dist urbance for utilities network operation, these outages occur frequently in transmission \nnetworks that have limited generation capabilities. It is associated with the disappearance of voltage from the 220 kV busbar. This \nwill force the transmission utility to disconnect the transformer from both sides and reconnect it again. \nTable IV assigned the highest RPN in transformer major failures to insulation deterioration and on-load tap changer respectively. \nInsulation deterioration is an irreversible phenomena associated with transformers in service that results from oxygen, moisture and \ntemperature. Moreover, it is considered the major reason of transformer failures before reaching their designed expected life  [17]. \nTap changer is the only moveable element in the transformer, and had been prone to a range of failures associated with the switching \ncontacts and drive mechanism. Therefore, the condition of the tap  changer oil and its contacts resistance are the most encountered \nproblems to power utilities [18]. Nowadays, large number of utilities mount filter units externally on the tap changer compartment. \nHowever, these units reduce the filtration periods of the oil but don’t give a clear view on the state of the switching contacts. Thus, \nthe contacts degradation and mechanical defects can remain undetected. \nCore and windings failures are the most catastrophic scenarios of transformers outages, they require an immediate replacement  \nof the transformer and, in case a spare transformer is not directly available, additional costs for not delivered power and penalty costs \nshould also be considered. The frequency of their occurrence is very low but their impact on the network operation is extremely high. \n \n \n \n23\nFMECA Analysis for the Assessing of Maintenance Activity for Power Transformers\nISBN 978-972-8954-42-0 | http://dx.doi.org/10.14195/978-972-8954-42-0_4\nTABLE III.
