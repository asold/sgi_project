INTRODUCTION  \nPower transformers are designed to provide safe, reliable deliv ery of electricity to the public and \nconsumers. However, operating the transformer at very high load ing condition to meet the demands can \naccelerate the deterioration of the unit. This is due to the in crease of mechanical, electric, and thermal \nstresses during the operation. If the transformer insulation co nditions degraded, the clamping pressure could \nbecome loose thus other failures accrued. This would reduce the  ability of a transformer to withstand high \ncurrent from short circuit fault. In addition, there are other failures that could occur such as mishandling the \nunit during transportation, earthquakes and even combustible gas explosion [1]. For his reason, it is important \nto conduct studies to investigate the transformer failures. \nToday, the FRA has become a complementary technique in order to  investigate the transformer \nfailures. The FRA measurement typically performs at a frequency range (50Hz to 5MHz) [1]. Based on IEEE \n[2] standard and CIGRE [3] it is approximately in the range of 20Hz to 2MHz. The FRA test is used to detect \nmechanical deformation in a transformer. It is applied after so me incidents that have the possibility of \ncausing this mechanical or electrical damage to the power trans former. Physical changes in the resistance, \ninductance and capacitance network of the transformer windings can alter the mathematical transfer function. \nThe transfer function behavior can detect a wide range of mecha nical or electrical changes in the electrical \n                ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 14, No. 1, April 2019 :  219 – 229 \n220\ncircuit representation of the transformer. Besides mechanical d amage. FRA is also sensitive to dielectric \nchanges such as due to aging which is not categorized as a mechanical fault [4]. \nIn order to investigate the effect of winding failures on FRA m easurement, faults need to be applied \nin the actual winding. However, this is difficult and costly be cause of the transforme r winding strength and \nthe price of transformer. For this reason, it is more practical  to perform winding failures in a transformer \nmodel represented using suitable software. It is known that tra nsformer winding can be represented by \nelectrical circuit with parameters of resistance, inductance, a nd capacitance (RLC). Therefore, it is important \nto be accurate in calculating winding parameters. There are var ious techniques used to simulate the \ntransformer RLC model such as finite element method (FEM) and s tate space model. A study conducted  \nin [5] used finite element analysis to calculate the inductance  a n d  c a p a c i t a n c e  o f  t h e  w i n d i n g  i n  o r d e r  t o  \ninvestigate the winding deformation. It was founded that FEM gi ves an accuracy in acceptable limits.  \nAlso, a study conducted in [6] to study a radial deformation in  the winding using FEM. It was shown that \nFEM can provides a significant information about the changes of  capacitance and inductance of the winding.  \nThe weakness in FEM is that it obtains only approximate solutio n. In addition, it was stated in [7] that FEM \nhas an inherent error. On the other hand, a state space modelin g was presented in [8] to simulate the actual \nmeasurement distribution transformer. It was founded that it is  easy to realize the impact of various \nmechanical deformations on the transformer FRA signature.  \nIn this paper, a lumped ladder network model is presented. The advantages of the model are that the \nphysical meaning of the model parameters is easy to identify. T his model can be used later to simulate \nvarious winding damages. For example, it is easy to identify th e disc required to apply the fault in.  \nIn addition, it is more physical to make the changes. The novel ty in this study is that the winding structure \ni t s e l f  i s  e n t i r e l y  n e w  t h u s  p o s e s  n e w  c h a l l e n g e s  t h a t  r e q u i r e s  different approach to simulate the  \nfrequency response. \nThis study presents a lumped parameter equivalent circuit model  w h i c h  r e p r e s e n t  a c t u a l  H V  \nwinding. The winding geometry was taken from an actual transfor mer HV winding. Then, the RLC \nparameters were calculated using a new method for the new winding structure. The simulated response shows \nan approximately similar when compared with the measured respon se. Then, changes in the RLC parameters \nare applied to investigate the effect on the response. This mod el can also be used to investigate the effect of \nnumber of discs on the response. Nevertheless, the main purpose  of this study is to investigate the \nrelationship between the level of fault-based on the change of winding resistance, capacitance  \nand inductance. \n \n \n2. HIGH-FREQUENCY MODELING OF TRANSFORMERS \nModeling the high frequency response of transformer winding has  a certain degree of complexity. \nThis is due to the arrangement of transformer winding electrica l  c i r c u i t .  I t  i s  i m p o s s i b l e  t o  u s e  a  s i m p l e  \nequivalent circuit to present the transformer winding. This is because at higher frequencies wavelength of the \nsignals are compared with the transformer winding geometry [9].  \nThe steps shown in Figure 1 are followed for calculating the high frequency response of transformer \nwinding. The first step is to measure the winding geometry. The  s e c o n d  s t e p  i s  t o  c a l c u l a t e  t h e  w i n d i n g  \nresistance, capacitance, self and mutual inductance using certa in formulas.

Each disc of the winding is represented by  resistance, capacitance, and inductance. In \nevery disc, for example D1 shown in Figure 2(a) consists of series inductance Ls, series capacitance Cs, \nseries resistance Rs and ground capacitance Cg.  \nFirst step the winding geometry was measured manually such as conductor geometry and winding inner \nand outer radius. The transformer was approximately looked like Figure2(b). According to [10], there are \nseveral types of transformer winding and have different ways of calculation. The main types of the winding \nare helical winding, layer winding, and disc winding. The transformer selected in this study is disc winding. \nThe equivalent circuit of the disc winding transformer for n-stage ladder network is shown in Figure 2 \nFigure 2(a). In order to simulate the transformer winding frequ ency response, it is required to \ncalculate the total series capacitance Cs. This required to calculate the capacitance in between turns Ct for \nevery disc. In the meantime, it is essential to calculate the c apacitance in between discs Cd. After that, \ncalculate the series resistance Rs, capacitance to the ground Cg, conductance Gs, self and mutual inductance \nML. Those electrical parameters must be obtained as a second step  to simulate the frequency response of the \ntransformer winding. \n \n \n \n(a) (b) \n \nFigure 2.

To calculate electrical \nparameters of the tested transformer, the specifications of the geometrical such as dimension of the conductor \nand thickness of the insulation are calculated. The full windin g consists of 96 discs. In every disc, there are \nfive turns. In every turns there are six conductors connected t ogether at the terminal.

The tw o responses show the same path of negative \nand positive slope. Nonetheless, there are some differences in the resonance at the h igh-frequency region. \nThese resonances are not shown in the calculated response. it i s believed that this is because 5mm air gap \nonly included in series capacitance and self inductance calcula tion. However, it is required to included in \nmutual inductance calculation. The same transformer is recommen ded to be studied in the future and \ncalculate the mutual inductance with the air gap effect.  \nHowever, Figure 11 shows the measured and simulated responses o f the same winding after \nimprovement. The simulated response shows more similar to the measured response. This is because of some \nchanges in the winding resistance Rs, conductance, Gs, and self-inductance. This improvement is \nimplemented using trial and error method. The changes are appli ed by decreasing winding resistance, \nconductance, and self-inductance. The total results of the tran sformer winding electrical parameters are \nprovided in Table 2. It also includes parameters of the improve d simulated response. To further understand \nthe results shown in Table 2, more investigation is needed on t he chosen transformer winding structure and \nthe calculation of its electrical parameters.

Al-Ameri) \n227\n3.4.  RLC Analysis \nBased on the obtained results, it can be realized that the freq uency response is affected by the \nchange of winding R, L and C values. The changes in electrical parameters cause the frequen cy response to \nshift towards lower or higher frequency. To investigate the sen sitivity of the model and simulate winding \nfaults, the following changes are applied: \na) Increase of series capacitance Cs as shown in Figure 12. \nb) Increase of series resistance Rs as shown in Figure 13. \nc) Increase of self-inductance Ls as shown in Figure 14. \nBy increasing the winding capacitance, the response is shifted towards low frequency.  \nThe simulated response in Figure 12 represent the winding when it has high capacitance which is ten times \nhigher than the normal winding response. By referring to Table 3 which is taken from other literature,  \nthe increase of series capacitance is mainly due to the aging o f transformer insulation. Table 3 shows the \ninvestigated parameters that influence the frequency response. \nOn the other hand, the increase of series resistance is affecti ng the response at low frequency as \nshown in Figure 13. In the figure, the simulated response at fr equencies below 10kHz showed a drop in \nmagnitude. The increase of resistance is usually due to damages  such as in the tap changer according to  \nTable 3. Based on a study on tap changer damage in [15], findings in the reference also shows a similar effect \non the measured response which refers to a coking in the tap changer.  \nThe increase of self-inductance by ten times of the original va lue has a significant change in the \nsimulated response. The anti-resonance which was originally at 200kHz has been shifted towards low \nfrequency at 30kHz and showed a drop in magnitude on the negati ve slope. Such changes on the response is \nbelieved to be due to short circuit and core deformation as mentioned in Table 3. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12.

CONCLUSION \nIt has been noted that FRA is a reliable method to investigate the mechanical condition of \ntransformer winding. This paper presents a study on a unique tr ansformer winding structure to simulate the \nfrequency response. This winding has 5mm air gap in between winding turns 2 and 3 thus present a challenge \nto simulate the response as the winding turns are not uniformly  distributed. In this study, we present a new \ntechnique which is to calculate the capacitance in between turn s Ct separately. Similarly goes with the \ncalculation of capacitance between discs, Cd. In addition, the self-inductance per disc considered in this study \nis that there are actually two different self-inductances which  are connected in series. This is due to the \ninsulation gap in between turns 2 and 3. It has been observed t hat increasing the series capacitance causes \nshifting in the response towards low frequencies. Whilst increa sing the winding resistance shows a drop in \nmagnitude at the low-frequency region. In fact, the change in s elf-inductance shows a major effect on the \nresponse. The response shows a dr op in the anti-resonance of th e response. In the meantime, the drop in \nresponse is clearly shown at low frequencies. In this paper, RL C analysis only investigate the increasing of \nseries capacitance, series resistance, and self-inductance. Thi s  i s  b e c a u s e  w e  b e l i e v e d  t h a t  t h e s e  t h r e e  \nparameters have major effect on the frequency response. Further  s t u d y  i s  r e c o m m e n d e d  t o  d e v e l o p  s t a t e  \nspace model for this particular transformer which could be comp are with the proposed model. This is to \nconclude which approaches can give similar to the measured resp onse. But, it is believed that the minor \nchanges between simulation and measured responses is because of  the assumptions of the winding spaces. \nThe spaces includes a wooden press board and oil partials which has an effect on the frequency response.  \n \nSYMBOLS \n \nNd Number of discs \nmt Number of turns per disc \nd The distance between two discs \nh Height of the turns without insulation.  \nw Width of the turns without the insulation. \nCir The total circumference of the conductor. \n𝜀௢ The permittivity of free space  \n𝜀௥ Relative permittivity of the insulation paper \nCt  The capacitance in between turns \nCd  Capacitance in between the discs \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThis work is supported financially by the University Tun Hussei n Onn Malaysia under Special \nContract Grant vot U425 and GPPS PhD student grant project vot U708.
