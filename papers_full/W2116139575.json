  "full_text": "SHORT REPORT Open Access\nThe use of a low cost 3D scanning and printing\ntool in the manufacture of custom-made foot\northoses: a preliminary study\nColin E Dombroski1,2*, Megan ER Balsdon2 and Adam Froats1,2\nAbstract\nBackground: Custom foot orthoses are currently recognized as the gold standard for treatment of foot and lower\nlimb pathology. While foam and plaster casting methods are most widely used in clinical practice, technology has\nemerged, permitting the use of 3D scanning, computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing\n(CAM) for fabrication of foot molds and custom foot orthotic components. Adoption of 3D printing, as a form of\nCAM, requires further investigation for use as a clinical tool.\nThis study provides a preliminary description of a new method to manufacture foot orthoses using a novel 3D\nscanner and printer and compare gait kinematic outputs from shod and traditional plaster casted orthotics.\nFindings: One participant (male, 25 years) was included with no lower extremity injuries. Foot molds were created\nfrom both plaster casting and 3D scanning/printing methods. Custom foot orthoses were then fabricated from\neach mold. Lower body plug-in-gait with the Oxford Foot Model on the right foot was collected for both orthotic\nand control (shod) conditions. The medial longitudinal arch was measured using arch height index (AHI) where a\ndecrease in AHI represented a drop in arch height. The lowest AHI was 21.2 mm in the running shoes, followed by\n21.4 mm wearing the orthoses made using 3D scanning and printing, with the highest AHI of 22.0 mm while the\nparticipant wore the plaster casted orthoses.\nConclusion: This preliminary study demonstrated a small increase in AHI with the 3D printing orthotic compared\nto the shod condition. A larger sample size may demonstrate significant patterns for the tested conditions.\nKeywords: Custom-made foot orthoses, 3D printing, Microsoft Kinect, plaster casting\nFindings\nCustom foot orthoses have been linked to reduced risk\nand recurrence of injury through individualization of\ncushioning and support features [1]. Applications in-\nclude, but are not limited to: pain relief, increased heel\ncushion, correction of flexible deformity, increased foot\nstability and/or prevention of skin breakdowns, such as\nulceration [2]. Custom foot orthoses are currently recog-\nnized as the gold standard of treatment for foot and\nlower limb pathology, offering the benefits of individual-\nized prescription in comparison to over-the-counter\n“best fit” devices [3].\nCurrent best practice methods used to obtain a three-\ndimensional (3D) impression of a patients’ foot for use\nin orthoses manufacturing are plaster and foam box\ncasting. Each of these casting methods is subject to prac-\ntitioner error and may result in excess waste [4]. Add-\nitionally, when compared to the relative ease of foam\nbox casting, the plaster bandage method can be time\nconsuming and cumbersome [5].\nIn recent years, technology has emerged permitting\nthe use of 3D foot scanning, computer aided design\n(CAD), and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) in\nthe fabrication of foot molds and custom foot orthosis\ncomponents [6]. Three-dimensional (3D) printing, one\nof the most recent forms of CAM, has proven efficacy in\nthe fabrication of ankle foot orthoses (AFO) with reports\nof excellent dimensional accuracy, good manufacturing\nprecision, and performance that is at least equivalent to\n* Correspondence:colin@solescience.ca\n1Faculty of Health Science, Department of Physical Therapy, Western\nUniversity, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada\n2SoleScience Inc., Fowler Kennedy Sports Medicine Clinic, 3M Building,\nWestern University, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada\n© 2014 Dombroski et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Research Notes2014, 7:443\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/7/443\nhand-crafted AFO’s [7-9]. Recent studies report positive\nsubjective comfort ratings and similar biomechanical\ngait parameters with the use of orthoses manufactured\nusing 3D printing in comparison to orthoses fabricated\nusing traditional means [1,6,10].\nMass adoption of 3D printing for foot orthoses fabri-\ncation will require proven performance, value for money,\nand a good service model [10]. Currently, many 3D\nscanning tools, CAD programs and laser sintering ma-\nchines are inaccessible to many professionals due to the\nhigh cost of acquisition. A model using an easily access-\nible and affordable system, therefore, would have tre-\nmendous clinical applicability if proven valid.\nResearch purpose\nThe goal of this preliminary study was to investigate the\nfeasibility of a low cost 3D scanning and printing ar-\nrangement that would be fairly accessible to all foot care\npractitioners. The kinematics of the foot while walking\nwith custom foot orthoses made from the casting\nmethod was compared a shod condition as well as to or-\nthotics made with a novel CAM method consisting of\nthe Microsoft Kinect (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond,\nWA), open source software (MeshLab, a 3D-CoForm\nproject; SourceForge.net) and a desktop 3D printer\n(Makerbot®, Makerbot Industries, Brooklyn, NY).\nMethods\nOne male participant, age 25, was included, with no\nlower extremity injuries or abnormalities. The partici-\npant provided informed consent as required by the\nWestern University Research Ethics Board. The partici-\npant's right foot and ankle were held in the subtalar neu-\ntral position, defined by Root et al. [11] while the\nMicrosoft Kinect scanned the participant’s foot to a ste-\nreo lithography file (.STL) on its internal hard drive. The\n3D scan was then filled, smoothed and edited using open\nsource software before being sent to the 3D printer,\nwhere a positive foot mold was printed in acrylonitrile\nbutadiene styrene (ABS) filament, layered at 2 microns.\nA second foot impression was acquired using the trad-\nitional plaster casting method described by Root (1971)\nwhere the participant, prone, was held in a non-\nweightbearing position as dampened plaster strips dried\nand formed a negative positive foot impression. A posi-\ntive foot mold was then created by filling the plaster im-\npression with gauging plaster.\nCustom-made orthoses were fabricated from both foot\nmolds. A Vicon motion capture system (Vicon Motion\nSystems Ltd, Oxford, UK) with 6 Bonita cameras was\nused along with twenty-eight (28) passive reflective\nmarkers, placed on the participant to define the lower\nbody for standard Nexus plug-in gait and the Oxford\nFoot Model (OFM) [12] for the right foot. A static\nstanding trial was first collected to determine joint cen-\nters (Figure 1A). The single participant completed a 30-\nsecond warm up walk at 1.3 m/s, followed by three trials\nof approximately ten gait cycles at 1.3 m/s collected for\neach condition: control (running shoe), orthotic made\nfrom 3D printed casts and orthotic made from the plas-\nter casting method (Figure 1B). The running shoe used\nthroughout data collection was the Saucony Grid Omni\nWalker, model #5260. To allow for marker placement,\nwindows were cut into the shoe following the previously\nreported methods of Shultz and Jenkyn so as to not dis-\nrupt shoe integrity during gait testing [13].\nAn Arch Height Index (AHI) measure using the OFM\nwas compared between the averages of each condition in\nVicon Polygon. The AHI is a measure of the rigidity of\nthe forefoot segment, used as a quality measure to check\nthe accuracy of the model's assumption of forefoot rigid-\nity. AHI is also an estimate of arch height, that is, the\nnormal distance of the plane of the forefoot from the\nfirst metatarsal base.\nResults\nThree trials of ten gait cycles were averaged for each\ncondition, totaling approximately 30 gait cycles. During\nmidstance, the plaster casted orthotic provided the most\ncontrol over movement of the medial longitudinal arch\n(Figure 2). This movement was measured by arch height\nindex (AHI) where a decrease in AHI, measured in milli-\nmeters, represented a drop in medial longitudinal arch\nheight. The lowest AHI was 21.2 mm (SD 0.83 mm) in\nthe running shoes with standard sock liners, followed by\n21.4 mm (SD 0.96 mm) with the 3D printing orthotic,\nand finally the highest AHI of 22.0 mm (SD 0.84 mm)\nwhile the participant wore the plaster casted orthotics.\nOne standard deviation within the mean of each trial is\nshown in the shaded areas (Figure 2).\nFigure 1The Oxford Foot Model marker configuration for static\nstance and dynamic walking.Image (A) is a photograph of the\nstatic stance position with 13 foot and ankle markers, where image\n(B) shows a still image of a walking trial in Vicon Nexus with lower\nbody plug-in-gait and the Oxford Foot Model showing 10 markers\non the right foot and ankle complex.\nDombroski et al. BMC Research Notes2014, 7:443 Page 2 of 4\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/7/443\nDiscussion\nThe orthotic made from the 3D printing method re-\nsulted in a higher AHI than the shod condition, indicat-\ning that the orthotic restricted motion of the medial\nlongitudinal arch during midstance. The differences be-\ntween the three conditions were minimal (within 0.8 mm)\nand variability was similar with standard deviations within\n0.13 mm; however, statistical analysis was not performed\nsince the findings are based on only one participant. The\nmain limitation of this study is the sample size of only\none, providing only a preliminary description of this devel-\noping model. Testing additional participants may reveal a\nmore significant trend in the outcome measures using this\nhighly affordable and accessible 3D scanning and printing\nmethod.\nUsing the Microsoft Kinect system has not been docu-\nmented for this exact application; however, this scanning\nmethod has been validated in reproducing depth data\nfor indoor mapping applications [14], kinematic strat-\negies of postural control [15] and spatiotemporal gait\nvariables [16]. Other optical scanners have been vali-\ndated and are currently used in a clinical setting; there-\nfore, a separate study should be completed to validate\nthis particular scanning device for future use in fabrica-\ntion of foot molds with 3D printing methods.\nConclusion\nThese findings provide evidence that this method of\nfabricating foot orthoses produces an in-shoe device\nthat results in a similar AHI measure in comparison to a\ntraditionally made orthotic. With an increase in sample\nsize of healthy individuals, a more in depth investigation\ncould compare orthotics made from this method to both\nfoam and plaster casted orthotics, and analyze multiple\nkinematic differences between the devices. If proven suc-\ncessful in the future, this model could be a low cost\nmethod of custom foot orthotic manufacturing, thus\ncontrolling the ultimate cost to the clinician and end\nuser.\nConsent\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the par-\nticipant for publication of this report and any accom-\npanying images.\nAbbreviations\n3D: Three-dimensional; ABS: Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; AFO: Ankle foot\northosis; AHI: Arch height index; CAD: Computer aided design;\nCAM: Computer aided manufacturing; OFM: Oxford Foot Model; STL: Stereo\nLithography.\nCompeting interests\nCD is the owner of SoleScience Inc. and the pedorthic clinic where this\nself-funded research took place.
