    "abstract": "Recently, the superiority of multi-phase systems in comparison to three-phase energy systems has been demonstrated with regards to power generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization in particular. Generally, two techniques, specifically semiconductor converter and special transformers (static and passive transformation) have been commonly employed for power generation by utilizing multi-phase systems from the available three-phase power system. The generation of multi-phase power at a fixed frequency by utilizing the static transformation method presents certain advantages compared to semiconductor converters such as reliability, cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and lower total harmonics distortion (THD). Multi-phase transformers are essential to evaluate the parameters of a multi-phase motor, as they require a multi-phase signal that is pure sine wave in nature. However, multi-phase transformers are not suitable for variable frequency applications. Moreover, they have shortcomings with regard to impedance mismatching, the unequal number of turns which lead to inaccurate results in per phase equivalent circuits, which results in an imbalance output in phase voltages and currents. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate multi-phase power transformation from a three-phase system and examine the different static multi-phase transformation techniques. In line with this matter, this study outlines various theories and configurations of transformers, including three-phase to five-, seven-, eleven-, and thirteen-phase transformers. Moreover, the review discusses impedance mismatching, voltage unbalance, and per phase equivalent circuit modeling and fault analysis in multi-phase systems. Moreover, various artificial intelligence-based optimization techniques such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the genetic algorithm (GA) are explored to address various existing issues. Finally, the review delivers effective future suggestions that would serve as valuable opportunities, guidelines, and directions for power engineers, industries, and decision-makers to further research on multi-phase transformer improvements towards sustainable operation and management.",
