This strategy has two important\nlimitations. First, the capabilities of existing RSs to accurately cap-\nture a user’s true preferences are limited when relying solely on\nhistorical interaction data. Second, conventional RSs are often “nar-\nrow experts, ” lacking commonsense knowledge about users and\nitems, which leads to a restricted scope of recommendations [14].\nInspired by the commonsense reasoning and knowledge utiliza-\ntion capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there have been\nseveral attempts to integrate LLMs with RSs and mitigate their\ninherent limitations [26, 49, 62]:\n•LLMs as RSs : Here, LLMs, whether initially trained or further\nfine-tuned using user-item interaction data, are adapted to serve\nas RSs [27, 41, 50] and directly generate candidate items in text.\nThis approach easily suffers from the hallucination problem [2],\nespecially given large item catalogue sizes and extensive item\nnames [21].\n•LLMs enhance RSs: Here, RSs are enhanced with world knowl-\nedge and reasoning abilities of LLMs [25, 27, 32, 41, 50, 59]. This\ncategory limits LLMs to offering semantic information within a\nconventional recommendation paradigm, sometimes leading to\ninconsistencies between the semantic and behavior spaces.\narXiv:2405.15114v1  [cs.IR]  24 May 2024\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Yuyue Zhao et al.\n:The actorsin the retrieved movies are not as famous as the actorsin the user’s previous films.

The LLM-based\nsurrogate userlearns the real user’s preferences and decides\nto employ attribute-oriented tools to explore areas of items.\nThis process leads to a broad view of items, which, in turn,\nleads to the successful retrieval of the target item. It is impor-\ntant to note that the areas representing different attribute-\noriented items that are retrieved according to a specific at-\ntribute may contain overlapping elements.\n•LLMs control RSs: Here, LLMs are used to monitor and con-\ntrol the recommendation pipeline. Existing controllers either\nhave simple control strategies [10, 16] or necessitate active user\ninvolvement [8]. Their decisions are rarely human-like, which\nhinders their effectiveness in applications.\nTool learning for recommendations. Motivated by recent ad-\nvancements in tool learning with foundation models [e.g.,35, 36, 55],\nwe propose to use LLMs as a surrogate user to emulate her/his\ndecision-making process along with the utilization of tools. At the\ncore of our proposal is the task of learning to adaptively select\nappropriate recommender tools and curate a user-centric item list\nthat is aligned with the user’s preferences. Figure 1 illustrates a\nfour-round example of how ToolRec works. The LLM starts the\nsimulation by focusing on the movie genre and selects an initial set\nof 5 movies; satisfied with the genre of the returned movies, it then\naims to complement the set based on the release_year, and retrieves\n3 additional movies; subsequently, the LLM refines its focus towards\nthe actors, leading to an adjustment of four movies in the list. Such\niterative refinements continue until the simulator deems the movie\nlist satisfactory enough to include the item of interest, thus finish-\ning the recommendation process. Notice how the LLM directs the\nrecommendation through multiple decision-making rounds with\nattribute signals, contrasting with conventional RSs. By adopting\nthis approach, we aim to move beyond relying solely on users’ his-\ntorical interactions, resulting in a more tailored set of recommended\nitems (cf. the red area on the right of Figure 1).\nUsing LLM tool learning to simulate users’ decision-making pro-\ncesses presents distinct challenges. The first challenge concerns the\nrecommendation ability of LLMs. Although LLMs are pretrained on\nextensive datasets [1, 28], improving their ability to produce qual-\nity recommendations remains a challenge, particularly in domain-\nspecific scenarios. The second challenge is developing appropriate\nattribute-oriented tools. Attribute-oriented tools should not only\nbe capable of exploring facets of the item pool (e.g., genre, release\nyear of movies) but also need to be effective in handling differ-\nent attribute choices during decision simulation. Lastly, leveraging\nLLMs to refine the set of candidate items in each round presents a\nsignificant challenge. This step could ensure that the final results\nbenefit from an LLM’s open-world knowledge and are not limited\nby a single “narrow expert. ”\nA new proposal for tool learning for recommendations. To\naddress the challenges listed above, we introduce ToolRec, for LLM-\nempowered recommendations via tool learning, which is aimed\nat aligning the emergent abilities of LLMs with the demands of\nrecommender systems. ToolRec comprises three key components:\n(i) A user decision simulation module : We use LLMs initialized\nwith user behavior history, acting as a surrogate user to evaluate\nuser preferences against the current scenario. (ii) Attribute-ori-\nented tools: We develop two distinct sets of attribute-based tools:\nrank tools and retrieval tools. The ranking tools are operationalized\nby LLMs with attribute-oriented ranking instructions, while the\nretrieval tools are operationalized by merging a frozen backbone\nwith additional fine-tuned attribute encoders. These tools are acti-\nvated when the surrogate user identifies unsatisfactory attributes,\nand then fetches corresponding candidate items. (iii) A memory\nstrategy: This component checks the presence of intermediate re-\nsults and stores them with associated tool marks, aiding the LLM in\nleveraging open-world knowledge to refine the final recommenda-\ntion list. The latter two components are governed by the surrogate\nuser’s decisions, and conclude the recommendation process once\na satisfactory candidate item list has been found. ToolRec’s itera-\ntive framework integrates LLMs into recommender systems while\nenhancing the quality of recommendations.\nContributions. Our main contributions are as follows:\n•We propose ToolRec, a framework that deploys LLMs to enhance\nrecommendations via tool learning. It employs LLMs to closely\nemulate user preferences, thereby improving the accuracy of\nrecommendations generated during user decision simulation.\n•To better meet the surrogate user’s needs, we incorporate at-\ntribute-oriented tools and a memory strategy. Those components\naddress the challenge of effective item retrieval based on identi-\nfied attributes, ensuring the recommendations are well-aligned\nwith user preferences.\n•Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of ToolRec, especially in domains enriched by\nworld knowledge.\n2 RELATED WORK\nWe review tool learning with LLMs and the use of LLMs for recom-\nmendation.\n2.1 LLMs with Tool Learning\nThere is a growing trend to employ LLMs to construct autonomous\nagents to achieve decision-making capabilities [ 4, 31, 35, 36, 61].\nLet Me Do It For You: Towards LLM Empowered Recommendation via Tool Learning SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nThese LLM-based agents often fall short in domains that demand ex-\ntensive expert knowledge and suffer from hallucination issues [42].\nTo alleviate these problems, these agents are enhanced with the abil-\nity to invoke external tools for action execution. Previous external\ntools can be grouped into three types: APIs [ 24, 30, 31, 35, 36],\nDatabases & Knowledge Bases [ 11, 17, 23], and External Mod-\nels [38, 52, 60].\nThe use of APIs as tools has become a popular approach. E.g.,\nHuggingGPT [36] employs models on HuggingFace to accomplish\ncomplex user tasks. API-Bank [ 24] serves as an LLM-based API\nrecommendation agent, and autonomously searches and generates\nsuitable API calls across various programming languages and do-\nmains. ToolBench [30] is an LLM-based tool generation system\nthat creates various tools based on natural language requirements.\nConnecting LLMs to external databases or knowledge bases en-\nables access to domain-specific information, thus generating more\nrealistic actions. E.g., ChatDB [17] uses SQL statements to query\ndatabases, enabling logical action execution by agents. Similarly, in\nthe recommendation scenario, RecMind [44] and InteRecAgent [21]\nengage various expert systems such as MySQL and planners to re-\ntrieve detailed item information. Employing external models can ex-\npand the range of feasible actions. E.g., MemoryBank [60] employs\ntwo language models to enhance text retrieval capabilities: one for\nencoding input text and the other for matching query statements.\nMM-REACT [52] integrates various vision models to improve its\nperformance in visual understanding tasks.\nOur attribute-oriented rank tools can be summarized into APIs,\nwhile retrieval tools can be summarized into external models. This\napproach helps our surrogate user to explore different interest areas\nand return a better user preference-aligned item set.\n2.2 LLMs for Recommendation\nMethods using LLMs in RSs come in three groups, based on the\nrole of the LLMs: LLMs as RSs [ 3, 12, 13, 19, 51, 53, 58], LLMs as\nassistants [27, 41, 50], and LLMs as pipeline controllers [8, 10, 21,\n44].\nLLMs as RSs involve using LLMs to generate candidate items. For\ninstance, P5 [12] is fine-tuned on T5 [33] with a collection of per-\nsonalized prompts to achieve zero-shot generalization. Following\nthis, UP5 [19] and VIP5 [13] extend the paradigm to fairness and\nmultimodal tasks, respectively. InstructRec [58] views recommen-\ndation as an instruction following task for LLMs, tuning T5 with\nuser-specific instructions. TALLRec [ 3] trains LLaMA [ 39] with\nLoRA [18] to follow instructions and respond to a binary query\nprovided within the contextual information. LLaRA [ 25] utilizes\nhybrid prompting to bridge the modality gap between traditional\nrecommendation systems and LLMs.\nWhen LLMs serve as Assistants, LLMs are leveraged for their\nfactual knowledge or reasoning capabilities to generate or encode\nauxiliary textual features, assisting conventional RSs with semantic\ninformation. For example, Various studies use auxiliary textual\nfeatures from BERT [7] for document ranking [63], while others\naim to leverage these features for news recommendation [32, 46, 59].\nKAR [50] extracts reasoning and factual knowledge from LLMs to\nserve as augmented features, enhancing recommendation models\nin a model-agnostic manner.\nUserdecisionsimulation\nAttribute-orientedtools\nuserprofileitems attribute,quantity\nitems\nrecordsMemorystrategy\nFigure 2: An overview of the proposed LLM-based recommen-\ndation method via tool learning.\nIn the setting where LLMs act as Pipeline Controllers, models\nsuch as Chat-REC [10] use ChatGPT to understand user preferences,\ndecide whether to use the backend recommender system, and refine\nthe suggested items before showing them to the user. RecLLM [8]\nand InteRecAgent [21] propose frameworks for integrated conver-\nsational recommender systems with LLMs managing dialogues,\nunderstanding user preferences. InteRecAgent further determines\nthe usage of various tools (i.e., information query tools, retrieval\ntools, and rank tools) to support the candidate items. RecMind [44],\ninspired by P5’s various-task experiment setup, manages tool usage\nthrough a Self-Inspiring mechanism. Agent4Rec [56] simulates and\ninfers user-personalized preferences and behavior patterns using a\nLLM-based movie recommendation simulator.\nWhile these pipeline controller efforts address challenges similar\nto ours, there are several aspects that make our approach differ-\nent from theirs. First, we focus on the sequential recommendation\ntask and top-N recommendation setting. Second, we introduce\nattribute-oriented tools designed specifically for the recommenda-\ntion exploration journey. Lastly, we propose a proactive analysis of\npreference mismatches by using an LLM as a surrogate user.\n3 METHODOLOGY\nWe propose ToolRec, as illustrated in Figure 2. We first formalize\nthe recommendation process as a process exploring users’ interests.\nThen, we introduce a general framework that adapts LLMs as sur-\nrogate users to enhance the recommendation mechanism through\nattribute-oriented tools.\n3.1 Problem Formulation\nIn the context of sequential recommendation, as illustrated in Fig-\nure 1, given user 𝑢 with a historical interaction sequence H =\n{𝑖1,𝑖2,...,𝑖 𝑛−1}, the goal is to predict the next item of interest\n𝑖𝑛 ∈I, where Iis the complete item pool. Conventional RSs re-\ntrieve a subset I𝑐 ⊆I based on the predicted preferences of user\n𝑢. However, this easily results in the desired item𝑖𝑛 being absent\nfrom I𝑐.\nIn this work, we position LLMs as the central controller for rec-\nommendation, simulating the user exploration w.r.t. item attributes\nin a multi-round manner. The interaction history Hof user 𝑢 is\nfed into the LLM, so as to initialize the profile of surrogate user ˆ𝑢.\nIn the first round, ˆ𝑢identifies a key attribute 𝑎1 and uses external\ntools to fetch the related item set I𝑎1\nˆ𝑢 . For clarity and brevity, we\nomit the subscript ˆ𝑢 when the user is clear from the context. In\nthe second round, ˆ𝑢 contrasts the preferences between I𝑎1 and\nH, selects another attribute 𝑎2, and retrieves I𝑎2 . Such iterative\nrefinements continue until ˆ𝑢is satisfied with the retrieved items,\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Yuyue Zhao et al.\nand outputs the final set Iˆ𝑢 ranked by preference. Each derived\nitem set reflects the interest emerging from the respective round.\n3.2 User Decision Simulation\nTo validate LLMs’ capability in simulating user preferences and uti-\nlizing external tools, we draw inspiration from prior tool-learning\nstudies [30, 31, 35, 55] and propose a user decision simulation pro-\ncess. Here is an example of the simulation prompt in the movie\nrecommendation scenario:\n“Assuming you are an online movie recommender, your task is to help users find movies they wouldliketo watch next based on their interests. To effectively recommend movies, you should follow three steps: Thought, Action, Observation. During the Thought step, your objective is to consider how to make the final movie list match the user’s preferences,and decide the best course of action<𝒟>. If the movie list is good enough or no better actiontotake, you will finish early with the candidate movie list. For the Action step, you have three options: Retrieval,Rank,andFinish.<𝒯>”\nUserDecisionSimulationPromptExample\nwhere <D> represents the collection of demonstrations that show\nLLMs what a good movie list looks like, and <T> denotes the\ndetailed description of the tools. The foundational elements of the\nuser decision simulation methodology are twofold:\nChain-of-thought prompting (CoT). We use CoT [45] to syner-\ngize reasoning and action. Here, “reasoning” refers to the “thinking\nprocedure” for how to recommend suitable items to users, and\ndecide the details of the subsequent action. Meanwhile, “action”\nentails executing the directives derived from reasoning, making\n“observations, ” and yielding the corresponding outcome. At each\nstep 𝑡, the LLM-driven surrogate user ˆ𝑢 receives an observation\n𝑜𝑡−1 from the last step and derives a thought 𝑔𝑡 to take an ac-\ntion A𝑡 following some policy 𝜋(𝑔𝑡,A𝑡|𝑐𝑡), where 𝜋 could be im-\nplemented by any LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, in our ToolRec,\nand 𝑐𝑡 = (𝑜0,𝑔1,A1,𝑜1,...,𝑔 𝑡−1,A𝑡−1,𝑜𝑡−1)is the context to the\nˆ𝑢. The primary objective is to deduce the policy and mapping\n𝑐𝑡 →(𝑔𝑡,A𝑡). As shown in the left of Figure 1, within the context\n𝑐𝑡, ˆ𝑢 observes a discrepancy in the movie actors between the re-\ntrieved movies and the user’s previous movies. Consequently, it\ndecides to rank the movie list based on their actors (i.e., A𝑡) and\nobtain 𝑜𝑡. If ˆ𝑢is satisfied within the context (i.e.,𝑐𝑁), by comparing\nthe candidate items to the user’s history, then ˆ𝑢will conclude the\nprocess and present the final set of candidate items, denoted as Iˆ𝑢.\nTool learning. Tool learning technology refers to combine the\nstrength of LLMs and specialized tools, as discussed in previous\nstudies [30]. Here, our tools are activated by the generated ac-\ntion A𝑡 [31, 35, 55]. For each context 𝑐𝑡, the initial observation\n𝑜0 = (H,T,D)is composed of the user 𝑢’s historical interactions\nH, tool description T, and demonstration D. The tools can be\ncategorized into two types based on T𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒, which can be either\n“retrieve tools” or “rank tools. ” The description Telucidates the\nimpact of using the tools, and Doffers practical demonstrations\nof their application. Together, these components promote the ef-\nfective utilization of external tools. Tool actions are formulated as\nT𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 [𝑎𝑡,$𝐾], where T𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 ∈{𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙,𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑘 }, 𝑎𝑡 indicates the\nchosen attribute based on ˆ𝑢’s decision at time𝑡, and $𝐾specifies the\nnumber of items to be returned. For instance, as shown in Figure\n1, at the first step, ˆ𝑢opts to use the retrieval tools conditioned on\nthe attribute “genre” and retrieves 5 items. Meanwhile, at step 3, ˆ𝑢\ndecides to employ rank tools conditioned on the attribute “actor”,\nreturning the top 4 items. This phase is constructed to emulate a\nhuman-like approach of leveraging tools to broaden their choices\nthrough linguistic reasoning.\nThe CoT prompting phase controls the iterative decision process,\ndetermining when to employ external tools or finalize the recom-\nmendations. Concurrently, feedback from these tools enhances item\nexploration and further refines the recommendation process.\n3.3 Attribute-oriented Tools\nBy empowering an LLM to use tools, we can explore different parts\nof the item pool, uncovering target items that remain latent. To\nachieve this, we have designed two types of tools.\n3.3.1 Rank tools. For attribute-oriented rank tools, we incorpo-\nrate a ranking instruction template and employ LLMs to order the\ncandidate items. Given that LLMs have demonstrated proficiency\nin both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios [ 16], their capabilities\nare essential for returning item sets that align more closely with\nthe user’s latent intent. Our instruction for ranking is framed as:\n“{User Historical Record } {Prior Retrieved Item Set }. Please rank the\nabove recommended movies by measuring the possibilities that the\nuser would like to watch next most according to the movie [Attribute\nPattern 𝑎𝑡] attribute and the given movie history records, and output\ntop [Output Size Pattern $𝐾] movies except user’s historical movies . ”\n3.3.2 Retrieval tools. For each user, our attribute-oriented retrieval\ntools accept an attribute pattern 𝑎𝑡 and a specified item set size\n$𝐾, subsequently returning the matching candidate item set. An\nintuitive way is creating dedicated models tailored to each attribute\npattern. However, it is markedly inefficient to fully train and store\nseparate models for every possible attribute permutation. To address\nthis, we introduce a two-stage method for managing attribute-\nspecific variations:\nPre-training. The pre-training stage is for the original model with\nno attribute-specific consideration. Without loss of generality, we\nincorporate the attribute-specific switches into the popular sequen-\ntial recommendation model, SASRec [22]. For a historical behav-\nior sequence H, the 𝑙-th layer behavior representation matrix is\ndenoted as H𝑙 = {h𝑙\n1,h𝑙\n2,..., h𝑙\n|H|}, where h𝑙\n𝑖 is the 𝑙-th layer’s\nrepresentation of the 𝑖-th behavior within the sequence H. Then\nin the final layer 𝐿, the pre-training behavior representation H is\nderived:\nH = 𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑞(H|𝛽)= h𝐿\n|H|, H𝑙+1 = Transformer𝑙\nℎ(H𝑙), (1)\nwhere 𝑓𝑠𝑒𝑞 represents the sequential model, 𝛽 is the pre-training\nparameter, Transformer denotes the Transformer architecture en-\ncoder, and H is considered as the user representation at the pre-\ntraining phase for sequential recommendation.\nAttribute-specific encoder in tuning. As illustrated in Figure 3,\nafter learning the pretrained model, we freeze the pre-training\nparameter 𝛽. Our goal is to fine-tune the attribute-specific encoder.\nTo achieve this, we construct an additional attribute encoder 𝑓𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑟.\nThis encoder takes the user’s historical item attribute sequence, 𝑎𝑢,\nLet Me Do It For You: Towards LLM Empowered Recommendation via Tool Learning SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nSequential Model(pre-trained)\nAttribute-SpecificEncoder\nBehavior Seq \nAttribute Seq\n×\nDense layer\n𝒊 𝒖ℒ!\"#\n+\nFigure 3: Fine-tuning stage of attribute-oriented retrieval\ntools. The parameters in the blue ‘ice’ section remain fixed,\nwhile those in the red ‘flame’ section are exclusively fine-\ntuned.\nas input. Importantly, Hand 𝑎𝑢 are aligned based on items in the\nhistorical sequence. Subsequently, we define the𝑙-th layer attribute\nrepresentation matrix as 𝒂𝑙𝑢 = {𝒂𝑙\n1,𝒂𝑙\n2,··· ,𝒂𝑙\n|𝑎𝑢 |}. Similar to the\npre-training approach, the attribute sequence representation 𝒂𝑢 is\nlearned as:\n𝒂𝑢 = 𝑓𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑟 (𝑎𝑢|𝛾)= 𝒂𝐿\n|𝑎𝑢 |, 𝒂𝑙+1\n𝑢 = Transformer𝑙\n𝑎(𝒂𝑙\n𝑢). (2)\nWe then incorporate a dense layer to encode the combination of\nattribute representation 𝒂𝑢 and the frozen behavior representation\nH, resulting in a new user representation:\nu = Dense(𝒂𝑢 ⊕H,𝜃), (3)\nwhere 𝛾 and 𝜃 are the trainable parameters in the tuning phase.\nThe sequential recommender is trained by minimizing the BPR loss\nfunction:\nL𝐵𝑃𝑅 = −\n∑︁\n(H,𝑣)∈O+,(H,𝑤)∈O−,\nlog 𝜎(𝜙(u,𝑣)−𝜙(u,𝑤)), (4)\nwhere O+and O−denote the positive samples and negative sam-\nples, 𝜙(·)represents the inner-product layer, and 𝜎(·)refers to the\nSigmoid activation function. During the pre-training phase, u is\nrepresented by H. The finetuned user embedding u is designed to\nbe sensitive to the specific attribute, while maintaining the per-\nsonalized sequential recommendation learned in the pre-training\nphase.\n3.4 Memory Strategy\nThe vast number of items and the complex item names&IDs pose\na challenge for LLMs when generating control commands or tool\nusages. Additionally, items retrieved from various tools should be\nsystematically ordered to aid the LLM-based surrogate user ˆ𝑢 in\nmaking decisions. Therefore, we introduce a memory strategy, en-\nsuring the correctness of generated items and cataloging candidate\nitems with their respective tool annotations.\nThe memory strategy is initialized with the item pool directory.\nWhenever external tools return candidate items, particularly from\nattribute-oriented rank tools, the strategy verifies the presence of\nthese items in the initial directory. If there are any discrepancies,\nthe tools are prompted to re-run with additional incorrect details\nattached behind. Once validated, the candidate items are recorded\nalongside their associated tool marks, in order to serve the sub-\nsequent tool calls. As an illustration, a typical prompt might be\nTable 1: The statistics of the datasets used.\nDatasets #Users #Items #Interactions Sparsity (%)\nML-1M 6,041 3,884 1,000,209 95.74\nAmazon-Book 158,349 97,566 3,876,663 99.97\nYelp2018 77,278 45,582 2,102,836 99.94\n“Here’s the top [Output Size Pattern $𝐾] movie ID, movie name, and\nthe recommendation confidence score from the recommender system\nwith [Attribute Pattern 𝑎ˆ𝑢] type. {Candidate Item Set }. ”\n4 EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we report on extensive experiments aimed at evalu-\nating the performance of our proposed ToolRec. Our experiments\nfocus on answering the following research questions: (RQ1) How\ndoes ToolRec compare to conventional RSs and LLM-based RSs in\nthe sequential recommendation setting? (RQ2) How do different\ncomponents (i.e., user decision simulation, termination round, at-\ntribute-oriented retrieval tools ) influence our ToolRec? And(RQ3) Are\nLLMs capable of using their inherent knowledge to cater to the\nrecommendation task’s needs?\n4.1 Experimental Settings\n4.1.1 Datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we\nconduct experiments on three real-world datasets: Ml-1M, Amazon-\nBook, and Yelp2018.\n•ML-1M. This dataset is derived from the MovieLens-1M1 bench-\nmark, which contains user ratings for movies with timestamps.\nWe take the movies’ genre and release year as the attribute infor-\nmation.\n•Amazon-Book. This dataset 2 is extracted from Amazon.com\nplatform. We adopt the Book category to evaluate our method. We\ntake the books’ Price and Sales rank as the attribute information.\nA 10-core setting is applied to maintain dataset quality.\n•Yelp2018. This dataset is collected from the 2018 edition of the\nYelp Challenge.3 We utilize local businesses’ Categories, City and\nStars as attributes. We employ the 10-core setting to ensure a\nminimum of ten interactions for each user and item.\nFor each dataset, we organize users’ interactions chronologically\nbased on timestamps, allowing us to create the corresponding histor-\nical interaction sequences. Items are described using their product\nIDs&Names. We summarize the statistics of our datasets in Table 1.\n4.1.2 Evaluation protocols. We apply the leave-one-out strategy [22,\n37] and employ timestamps to set the sequence order, dividing the\ninteraction data into training, validation, and test sets. The attribute-\noriented retrieval tools are trained on the training and validation\nsets. To measure the recommendation performance, we adopt two\nwidely used metricsNDCG@N and Recall@N to evaluate the results\nwithin the top-N positions, with 𝑁 = 10 in our experiments. Due to\nbudget constraints, following prior work [10, 16], we randomly sam-\nple 200 users and their historical behaviors from the test set for each\ndataset. A similar, and similarly-sized, setting has been adopted in\nother recent LLM-related recommendation researches [56, 57]. To\nenhance the robustness and credibility of our results, we repeated\n1 https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ 2 https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/\n3 https://www.yelp.com/dataset\nSIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Yuyue Zhao et al.\nthe experiments three times, each with a different sample of 200\nusers. The average results and standard deviations from these trials\nare presented in Table 2.\n4.1.3 Baselines. We compare ToolRec4 against two traditional ap-\nproaches (the first two below), one that uses LLMs as RSs (the\nfollowing one), two that enhance RSs with LLMs (the next two),\nand two that use LLMs to control RSs (the remaining two).\n•SASRec [22]. A self-attention-based sequential recommender,\nwhich employs the encoder of the Transformer architecture to\ngenerate representations of users’ behavior sequences.\n•BERT4Rec [37]. A bidirectional self-attention-based sequential\nrecommender. It uses the Transformer encoder to predict ran-\ndomly masked items in a sequence by conditioning on both their\nleft and right context, thereby capturing user historical behaviors.\n•P5 [12]. An encoder–decoder Transformer-based approach that\nunifies different recommendation related tasks into a single gen-\nerative LLM. For our sequential recommendation downstream\ntask, we adopt the personalized prompts from OpenP5 [51] and\napply the same random indexing method to items as used in our\nToolRec. This model is fully fine-tuned using these personalized\nprompts on the pre-trained T5-small [33].\n•SASRec𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 [7]. An attention-based method that modifies the\nsingle interaction sequence encoder by adding a feature encoder\n(structured as shown in Figure 3). This model is fully fine-tuned\nusing semantic representations pre-trained with BERT.\n•BERT4Rec𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇. A variation of the BERT4Rec sequential rec-\nommender enhanced with BERT’s pre-trained representations.\n•Chat-REC [10]. The first work was on using an LLM as a con-\ntroller. For our sequential recommendation task, we adopt the\nrecommendation prompt based on the original paper, choose\nSASRec to supply the candidate items, and modify the output\nformat for parsing.\n•LLMRank [16]. A LLM-based ranking model. In our full-ranking\nexperimental setup, we retrieve thirty candidate items (according\nto the original paper) from SASRec and adjust the output format\nfor parsing.\n•ToolRec. The method that we propose. We primarily evaluate\ntwo versions of ToolRec: ToolRec that is implemented using\nexternal attribute-oriented retrieval tools with frozen 𝑆𝐴𝑆𝑅𝑒𝑐\nparameters; and ToolRec𝐵 that is developed using BERT4Rec as\nthe backbone for external attribute-oriented retrieval tools.\n4.1.4 Implementation details. We use the gpt-3.5-turbo-16k (Chat-\nGPT for short) model as our primary LLM within ToolRec. This\nmodel is responsible for parsing user preferences and assisting in\ntool learning. We retain the default hyperparameters of ChatGPT\nwithout modifications. To enable ToolRec to emulate user decisions,\nwe incorporate decision demonstrations into the prompt for in-\ncontext-learning. For attribute-oriented tools, retrieval tools are\nenhanced with corresponding additional item attributes specific to\neach dataset. Attributes are represented using word embeddings\nfrom GloVe [29]. These tools are developed on two widely recog-\nnized backbones: SASRec and BERT4Rec. Additionally, our rank\ntools are constructed with instructions on ChatGPT. We limit our\ndecision processes to a maximum of eight rounds.\n4 Our codes are available at https://github.com/Go0day/ToolRec-Code.\n4.2 Performance Comparison (RQ1)\nWe compare our proposal with conventional sequential recom-\nmenders and LLM-enhanced sequential recommenders, as detailed\nin Section 4.1.3. The results are reported in Table 2, from which we\nobserve:\n•In general, ToolRec outperforms all baselines on the ML-1M and\nAmazon-Book datasets. The performance improvement can be\nattributed to the efficacy of our designed ToolRec framework. By\ndelving into various facets of the item pool and utilizing LLMs to\nguide the exploration process, it can more effectively align with\nthe user’s intent.\n•ToolRec and ToolRec𝐵 consistently demonstrate improved perfor-\nmance compared to their respective underlying models (i.e., SAS-\nRec and BERT4Rec). This confirms the superiority of the ToolRec\nframework and underscores its adaptability. The results suggest\nthat our approach, which harnesses LLMs for recommendation\nthrough tool learning, has the potential to be integrated as a\nsupplementary module in various recommendation systems.\n•ToolRec exhibits subpar performance on the Yelp2018 dataset.\nWe attribute this to the LLM’s limited knowledge of local busi-\nnesses. Since LLMs are primarily trained on widely available web\ndata, they might possess a more robust understanding of topics\nlike movies and books than local (niche) businesses. In more spe-\ncialized domains, ToolRec, which involves multiple interactions\nbetween the LLM and external tools, has the potential to make\nmore incorrect decisions and may exhibit heightened deficien-\ncies when compared to other LLM-based approaches such as\nLLMRank and SASRecBERT.\n•In the approach where LLMs serve as RSs, P5 demonstrates strong\nperformance on the ML-1M. This is exciting, considering we use\ndatasets on the scale of millions (Table 1), and accurately gener-\nating items for users is challenging. However, P5 shows weaker\nperformance on the Amazon-Book and Yelp2018 datasets, poten-\ntially due to the fact that the sparsity of those datasets is higher\nthan ML-1M, thus leading to more severe hallucination issues.\nThe development of more carefully designed item indexing meth-\nods [20] may help alleviate this problem, but this falls beyond\nthe scope of our current research.\n•For LLM-enhanced RS approaches, such as SASRec 𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 and\nBERT4Rec𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇, it is not surprising to see improvements over\ntheir backbone models in most cases. However, on the ML-1M\ndataset, SASRec𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 performs much worse than SASRec. Mean-\nwhile, on the Amazon-Book dataset, BERT4Rec 𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇’s perfor-\nmance is comparable to its baseline version. While language\nmodels can generally augment recommendation tasks, addressing\nthe disparity between semantic and behavioral spaces remains\nchallenging.\n•For LLM-controlled RS approaches, such as Chat-REC and LLM-\nRank, they couldn’t achieve consistent improvements over SAS-\nRec in the same way as ToolRec. This suggests that merely using\nbasic control strategies or employing LLM as a ranker might not\nbe the most effective way forward for recommendation tasks.\nA more comprehensive strategy, as demonstrated by ToolRec,\nappears better suited to harnessing LLMs to enhance recommen-\ndations.\nLet Me Do It For You: Towards LLM Empowered Recommendation via Tool Learning SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nTable 2: The test performance comparison on three real-world datasets.

We examine the user deci-\nsion simulation, revealing how multi-round interactions enhance\nrecommendation quality. We evaluate the efficiency of our attribute-\noriented retrieval tools, highlighting the balance between rich in-\nformation and computational practicality.\n4.3.1 Effectiveness of user decision simulation. To verify the contri-\nbution of the user decision simulation component (cf. Section 3.2),\nwe conducted an ablation study considering three variants of Tool-\nRec: (i) Disabling the CoT and tool learning components of ToolRec,\nwe forced the LLM to rank the candidate items from SASRec and\noutput the result. This variant is denoted as “w/ single”; (ii) Unlike\n“w/ single”, we had the LLM rank candidate items using both SAS-\nRec and the attribute-oriented retrieval tools, termed “w/ multi”;\n(iii) We disable the CoT component, and instead, the LLM was in-\nstructed to generate all the steps of tool-calling at once and then\nstrictly follow the execution plan. This setup is termed “w/ Plan”.\nTo ensure fairness in our comparisons, both the “w/ single” and\n“w/ multi” variants use the same number of candidate items: thirty\nitems in total.\nWe demonstrate the experimental results in Figure 4 and have\nthe following findings:\n•Removing the CoT and tool learning component degrades the\nmodel’s performance. The “w/ single” variant consistently un-\nderperforms both “w/ multi” and “w/ Plan”, and its performance\nis even subpar compared to SASRec. This decline in performance\ncan be attributed to “w/ single” relying exclusively on the LLM’s\nzero-shot ranking without leveraging additional information to\nrefine the results.\n•It is important to note that the performance of attribute-oriented\nretrieval tools, namely “frozen + 𝑎1” and “frozen + 𝑎2”, is inferior\nto SASRec in dataset ML-1M. However, results refined by ’w/\nmulti’ not only surpass ’w/ single’ but also outperform SASRec.\nThis improvement suggests that the strength of our approach is\nnot solely due to the broader item size, but also derives from the\nassistance of the additional attribute information.\n•When comparing “w/ Plan” with “w/ multi”, the latter consis-\ntently achieves superior results. One potential reason might be\nthat the “generate-then-execute” approach in “w/ Plan” lacks\nSASRecforzen+a1forzen+a2w/ singlew/ multiw/ Plan T oolRec\n0.16\n0.18\n0.20\n0.22\n0.24Recall@10\nRecall@10\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\nNDCG@10\nNDCG@10\n(a) ML-1M.\nSASRecforzen+a1forzen+a2w/ singlew/ multiw/ PlanT oolRec\n0.025\n0.030\n0.035\n0.040Recall@10\nRecall@10\n0.0100\n0.0125\n0.0150\n0.0175\n0.0200\nNDCG@10\nNDCG@10\n(b) Amazon-Book.\nFigure 4: Performance of ToolRec and its variants.

Figure 5 illustrates\nthe distribution of the number of termination rounds,𝑁, in ToolRec.\nBased on the data, we make the following observations: (i) The\nmajority of processes conclude within three or four rounds. This\nsuggests that after a few iterations, our LLM-based surrogate user,\ndenoted as ˆ𝑢, develops a good understanding of whether the user’s\npreferences have been adequately addressed. (ii) While the major-\nity of successful hits also occur within three or four rounds, an\ninteresting trend emerges in the ML-1M dataset: both shorter and\nlonger processes tend to be more successful in reaching the target\nitem. One interpretation is that shorter rounds signify tasks that are\nmore straightforward for the surrogate user ˆ𝑢.

Figure 6\ncompares the number of trainable parameters and FLOPs on the ML-\n1M and Amazon-Book datasets. Here, ‘forzen+𝑎1’ represents our\nattribute-oriented retrieval tool with frozen backbone parameters,\nwhile ‘full+𝑎1’ denotes its full fine-tuning variant.\nWe have the following observations: (i) The SASRec𝐵𝐸𝑅𝑇 model\nis considerably larger than the original SASRec. This increase in\nsize can be attributed to the enriched semantic information present\nin the BERT embedding. (ii) The trainable parameter count for\n‘full+𝑎1’ aligns closely with that of SASRec. Essentially, this is akin\nto training an entirely new model. Such an approach becomes\nimpractical as the number of attributes escalates. (iii) While both\n‘forzen+𝑎1’ and ‘full+𝑎1’ exhibit identical FLOPs, the former boasts\na significantly reduced count of trainable parameters compared\nto the latter. Moreover, since our ‘forzen+𝑎1’ employs the shared\nbackbone of SASRec, storage is primarily reserved for the additive\nparameters from the attribute-specific encoder and the dense layer.\n4.4 Surprises and Limitations (RQ3)\nToolRec benefits from LLMs to reason about users’ preferences\nacross attributes, enabling multi-round interaction processes and\nimproved recommendations.\nSASRec SASRecBERT full+a1 forzen+a1\n0\n2\n4\n6Trainable Parameters\n1e6\nTrainable Parameters\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nFLOPs\n1e8\nFLOPs\n(a) ML-1M.\nSASRec SASRecBERT full+a1 forzen+a1\n0.00\n0.25\n0.50\n0.75\n1.00\n1.25Trainable Parameters\n1e7\nTrainable Parameters\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\nFLOPs\n1e8\nFLOPs\n(b) Amazon-Book.\nFigure 6: Comparison of trainable parameters and FLOPs for\nvarious retrieval model configurations.\nHowever, language models are not inherently designed for rec-\nommendation tasks. Below, we discuss the failures and limitations\nthis gives rise to.\n4.4.1 Unanticipated outcomes: Beyond conventional failures. For\na rigorous comparison with existing baselines, we employed the\nMemory strategy (cf. Section 3.4). This strategy ensures that re-\nturned items align with the dataset directory, prompting a re-run if\ndiscrepancies arise.\nHowever, beyond the traditional recommendation paradigm,\nsome samples that are typically classified as “failures” deserve a\nsecond look.\nFigure 7 shows an example. At Thought 5 , when our LLM-based\nsurrogate user, ˆ𝑢, is unsatisfied with the retrieved movies, it typi-\ncally evaluates the unsatisfactory attributes and uses external tools\nto uncover additional options, thereby refining the recommenda-\ntion.\nYet, in this scenario, rather than using external tools or settling\nfor the current list of candidates,ˆ𝑢decides to suggest “some popular\nmovies”, providing a top-𝑁 recommendation on its own. Since we\nnever trained the LLM on any of our recommendation datasets, it is\nevident that not all of the movies it suggests are found in the ML-1M\ndataset. As a result, this action is labeled as a “failure”, prompting a\nre-run. However, from another perspective, this could be viewed as\na successful recommendation; the only limitation is our inability to\nevaluate it within the current dataset constraints.\n4.4.2 Influence of LLM selection on recommendation performance.\nFollowing the experimental setup described in Section 4.1, we re-\nplace the base LLM with two alternative LLMs: Vicuna1.5-13B-\n16k [5] (Vicuna in short), an open-source chatbot fine-tuned on\nLet Me Do It For You: Towards LLM Empowered Recommendation via Tool Learning SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\nThought 𝟏: To recommend movies to the user, I need to use a conventional recommender system and retrieve 15items based on genre condition.

However, both variants yielded subpar outcomes, either fail-\ning to adhere to task instructions, misconstruing tool usage, or\nmisinterpreting user preferences (some representative failures are\ncataloged in the Appendix). Notably, even though Vicuna and PaLM\nuse the same prompt template as ChatGPT, they are unable to con-\nsistently generate recommendations across all test users, despite\nseveral attempts. This suggests that ChatGPT has better reasoning\ncapabilities than both Vicuna and PaLM.\nBeyond reasoning, a ranking experiment was conducted (cf. Sec-\ntion 4.3.1, w/ multi) to examine the open-world knowledge of var-\nious LLMs. As revealed in Figure 8, on datasets like ML-1M (and\nsimilar outcomes on Amazon-Book), both Vicuna and PaLM under-\nperformed SASRec, whereas ChatGPT exhibited superior results.\nThese findings align with insights presented in LLMRank [16]. How-\never, all three models lagged behind SASRec on the Yelp2018 dataset,\nsuggesting a possible limitation of LLMs in contexts like local busi-\nnesses, where open-world knowledge is limited and of more limited\nuse than on the other datasets.\n5 CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we zoomed in on the tool-learning capacities of LLMs,\nusing them as controllers to guide the exploration of item spaces\nin a recommendation scenario. Specifically, by treating LLMs as\nsurrogate users, they can adeptly capture the nuances of a cur-\nrent context alongside user preferences. Subsequently, we employ\nattribute-oriented tools for precise item retrieval. We developed\ntwo types of attribute-oriented tools: rank tools and retrieval tools,\neach fetching the corresponding candidate items. To enhance accu-\nrate item retrieval, items that appear in the process are verified and\nstored using the memory strategy. Extensive experiments on real-\nworld datasets rich in knowledge demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrationality of ToolRec.\nThe idea of using LLMs for simulation, either under the hood as\nin our approach or for counterfactual explorations while interacting\nwith users, holds great potential for combining the strengths of\nLLMs and recommendation models. In the short term, companies\noperating their own recommender systems may find it impractical\nto switch to LLM-based RSs. However, ToolRec could enhance rec-\nommendation performance by integrating LLMs with their current\nsystems. In the long-term, users are increasingly relying on LLMs\nfor various daily tasks, including recommendations. ToolRec does\nnot require extensive fine-tuning of the LLM, which can lead to\nadditional costs and potential delays due to outdated information.\nFurthermore, the results from ToolRec are more reliable than those\nfrom zero-shot or few-shot LLM recommendations, as they are\naugmented by traditional recommendation system outputs.\nAchieving strong recommendation performance hinges on a\ndataset with rich semantic knowledge and the robust capabilities of\nthe LLM. In future work, we plan to incorporate recommendation\nknowledge into LLMs to enhance domain-specific tool learning,\nsuch as retrieval-augmented generation or fine-tuning LLMs, po-\ntentially reducing the reliance on rich semantic knowledge. Ad-\nditionally, we intend to explore different types of tools, including\nsearch engines and databases, along with a self-reflection strategy,\nto achieve even more personalized recommendations.\nAcknowledgments.
