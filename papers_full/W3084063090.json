To\nillustrate this, in Figure 1 we show the most frequent words used in Twitter during April 2020 (the 2nd month of global\npandemic of COVID-19). As we can see words like \"death\", \"help\", \"COVID-19\" are among the popular words.\nAnalyzing people’s opinion and concerns on social media can help us to better understand public’s concern and\nexpectations, enabling the government and health ofﬁcial to have a better planning for managing the situation. There\nhas already been a few works analyzing COVID-19 related Tweets. As an example, in [2], Kleinberg et al. presented a\nground truth dataset of emotional responses to COVID-19, and presented a framework to detect the main concerns of\npeople in different countries on COVID-19 subject. In [3], Ordun and colleagues analyzed ﬁve different techniques to\nassess the distinctiveness of topics, key terms and features, speed of information dissemination, and network behaviors\nfor Covid-19 related tweets. In [4], Singh et al. looked at the information and misinformation shared on Twitter. They\ntried to see if the discussion is emerging from, myths shared about the virus, and how much of it is connected to\nother high and low quality information on the Internet. So far, there has not been a solid framework which leverages\nthe state-of-the-arts in natural language processing, to detect the trending COVID-19 related topics in social medial.\nBesides works trying to analyze textual data about COVID-19, there are many works trying to analyze other types\nof data (images, time-series, clinical information) to get insight and predictive models about different aspects of\nCOVID-19 [5, 6, 7, 8].\narXiv:2009.03947v3  [cs.CL]  19 Sep 2020\nFigure 1: The most frequent words used by people on Twitter during the ﬁrst 3 months of pandemic.\nIn this work, we propose a deep learning based framework to detect trending topics people are talking about on\nTwitter, using a combination of transfer learning and clustering algorithms. Deep learning based models have been\nvery successful in achieving state-of-the-art results in many of the NLP problems in the recent years, including\nword embedding, sentiment analysis, question answering, and machine translation [9, 10, 11]. We ﬁrst extract the\nrepresentation (embedding) of sentences in Tweets using \"Sentence Transformer\", which can capture the semantic\ninformation of the sentences. We then use clustering algorithms to group similar sentences (based on their embeddings)\ninto the same groups. Ideally different clusters contain different semantic topics. After that, text summarization is used\nto get the summary of sentences in each cluster, which can uncover the trending topics of them.\nCompared to the classical models for topic modeling (such latent Dirichlet allocation, LDA), this work better employs\nthe semantic information and meaning of the tweets, by ﬁrst representing a sentence-level embedding of tweets, and\nthen using those embeddings to group the tweets. In this way, we can ﬁnd similar topics by directly analyzing sentences,\nrather than considering words similarity (as used in LDA). Figure 2 shows the word-cloud of sentences belonging to\none of the topic clusters of our model.\nFigure 2: The wordcloud of popular words on Twitter during the ﬁrst few months of pandemic. Courtesy of UPenn.\nHere are the main contributions of this work:\n• We provide a novel framework, which can detect the trending COVID-19 related topics on social media,\nsuch as Twitter, in an unsupervised fashion. We do so, by ﬁrst extracting a sentence-level embedding using\nsentence-Transformer, and then grouping similar sentences into the same cluster using k-means clustering,\n2\nand ﬁnally extracting each cluster summary with a deep learning based text summarization. This summary\ncontains the major topics of each cluster.\n• We provide a detailed experimental study showing the promise of this work, and its advantages over simple\nbaselines such as using TF-IDF and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).\nThe structure of the rest of this paper is as follows: In section 2, we provide the details of the proposed algorithm.\nSection 3 provides an overview of the dataset used in our experiments. In Section 4, we provide the experimental\nanalysis of the proposed algorithm in terms of detected topics, trending words in each topic cluster, and sentence\nrepresentation similarity. And ﬁnally the paper is concluded in Section 5.\n2 Proposed method\nThis work proposes a new framework for detecting the trending COVID-19 related topics on Twitter, using Universal\nSentence Encoder and text summarization. The overall structure of our proposed approach is presented in Figure 3. As\nit can be seen from this ﬁgure, we ﬁrst obtain the adequate data from Twitter and get tweets through twitter API. After\nthat, data cleaning part needs to performed on the collected tweets. Then, the Universal Sentence Encoder is used to\nextract the feature representation (embedding) of tweet’s sentences. The sentence embeddings from different tweets are\nthen fed into the k-means clustering algorithm to group them semantically similar ones into the same cluster. In the end,\nTextRank summarization technique is applied on the sentences of cluster to generate a summary of each cluster, which\ncontains the most representative topic. More detailed description of each stem, is provided in the following subsections.\nTwitter API\nTweet Encoder\n(Universal Sentence Encoder)\nTweets Clustering\n(KMeans)\nData Extraction\nCleaning\nUser/ScheduledTask\nDate\nTextRank SummarizationT opics \n1.

These methods include a wide range of techniques from word movers distance to the recent\nstate-of-the-art methods such as SentBert and Universal Sentence Encoder [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. All of these methods\naim to provide a vector representation of sentence which can capture its semantic meaning, and provides similar\nrepresentations for similar sentences.\nFor example, Sentence BERT (also known as SentBERT), uses a Siamese coupled neural network composed of two\nidentical instances of BERT. Like any Siamese neural network, this model aims to ﬁnd the similarity between the\ntwo inputs sentences. Universal sentence encoder is another text embedding technique that has different versions for\ndifferent use cases. One variation of this model was trained with Deep Averaging Network (DAN), calledUSE_DAN.\nThis encoding model produces sentence embeddings in the way that it ﬁrst gets the average embeddings of words and\nbi-grams, and then applies a feed-forward neural network on the average representation. On the other hand, newer\n3\nversion of universal sentence encoder is based on the Transformers, called USE_T, that has higher accuracy and is\ncomputationally more intensive than USE_DAN. In this research, we employ the transformer encoder version of universal\nsentence encoder. USE_T can handle words, sentence and documents, as the input. Figure 4 shows the architecture of\nthis model and how it encodes text into high dimensional vectors. As it can be seen from the ﬁgure, USE_T has been\ntrained on various downstream tasks. The encoder blocks in this ﬁgure are based on the Transformer model proposed\nby the Vaswani et. al [17].\nFigure 4: Architecture of USE_T and its multi-task/multi-lingual learning paradigm with shared parameters [14].\nThe multi-task and multi-lingual training paradigm of the USE_T makes it more suitable for tasks such as semantic\nsentence pair retrieval. On the other hand, deploying USE_T in our study is more crucial with respect to relation of\nsemantically close tweets. The most powerful side of this architecture is its ability to ﬁnd similar texts without need for\nany pair computations. It provides a dense vector representation of each text unit, and this dense vectors can be used for\ncomputing distance or similarity between different tweets or sentences [18, 19].\nBased on the above reasons, we employ universal sentence encoder to capture the sentence representation of tweets.\nThe tweet embeddings obtained from USE_T enables us to calculate the similarity of sentences in a semantic way, which\nis used by the clustering phase. It should be noted that before injecting tweets as the input of USE_T, text cleaning is a\nmust-do process and we performed this by selecting the most sensible and usable sentences from the pile of tweets. The\nsentences which contain hashtags and mentions, are removed from our corpus.\n2.2 Tweets Clustering\nAs it can be seen from Fig 3, once the embedding are extracted, a clustering algorithm is used to cluster tweet’s\nsentences based on their embeddings obtained from previous step. The distance between two sentences’s embeddings\nin this case, provides the dissimilarity of tweets.\nDifferent clustering algorithms can be used for this purpose, such as K-means, spectral clustering, mean-shift, Density-\nBased Spatial Clustering (DBSC). We use K-means clustering algorithm here, for its simplicity, speed, and the ability\nto pre-deﬁne the number of clusters.\n2.3 Cluster summarization\nThe clustering step, provides several groups of semantically similar sentences. On high level, the tweets in the same\ngroups should contain more similar topics, than those in different groups. Although the centroid of each cluster should\ncontain the average embedding (therefore the average topic/concept of that cluster), it will not necessarily capture all\ntopics of that cluster. But it could serve as a simple baseline. A better solution for ﬁnding the topic of each cluster is to\nuse a text summarization technique to provide a meaningful and sensible summary of that cluster, capturing the key\ntopics. Here we used the TextRank summarization framework. More details on TextRank summarization is provided\nin [20, 21].\n4\n3 Dataset\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we used a dataset of tweets between 2020-03-29 and 2020-04-\n30, that are collected via twitter API. This dataset includes more than 8 million tweets in total for English language. We\nonly used a random sampled of 20 percent of this dataset, which contains 1.6M tweets in total.\nFigure 5 denotes the wordcloud of the most frequent words after removing the stopwords for each day. One interesting\nfact from this plot is that, some words are always present among the popular ones for different days. We removed any\nrepeatative words of previous days to have visualization in this ﬁgure.\nFigure 5: Wordcloud of twitter corona dataset based on each day; Each row presents a week.\nFigure 6 shows the frequency of 8 popular words over different days. So we can see how the temporal trend of those\nwords changes over time. A box-plot visulization is also presented in Figure 7, which provides information about the\nmost frequent words for the entire dataset. Th distribution shown in this plot is acquire over 33 days. For some words\nsuch as singing, only the ﬁrst days has dramatic frequency raise, while for other days, this frequency drops seemingly.\nSpeciﬁc words such as help are present for entire dataset and distribution is close to normal.\n2020-03-29\n2020-03-30\n2020-03-31\n2020-04-01\n2020-04-02\n2020-04-03\n2020-04-04\n2020-04-05\n2020-04-06\n2020-04-07\n2020-04-08\n2020-04-09\n2020-04-10\n2020-04-11\n2020-04-12\n2020-04-13\n2020-04-14\n2020-04-15\n2020-04-16\n2020-04-17\n2020-04-18\n2020-04-19\n2020-04-20\n2020-04-21\n2020-04-22\n2020-04-23\n2020-04-24\n2020-04-25\n2020-04-26\n2020-04-27\n2020-04-28\n2020-04-29\n2020-04-30\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\n20000\n25000\n30000\n35000\n40000\npeople health death crisis world home pandemic help\nFigure 6: Daily frequency of top frequent words in Tweets.\nWe also labeled the dataset using opinions of six experts.

Before going into the model analysis,\nwe will provide the details of the hyper-parameter values, and experimental setup.\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nWe used the universal sentence encoder transformer based version 5, which is available at Google Tensorﬂow-hub1.\nThis version has been trained on a monolingual dataset with embeddding dimension of 512. We used dot product for\nsimilarity of embeddings.\nFor K-means clustering algorithm, the number of clusters is set to 30, and the max iteration to 300. This algorithms has\nbeen initialized with K-Means++ algorithm. After clustering, we merged smaller clusters with the larger ones using the\nsimilarity of their centroids. The clusters with smaller sizes are thought to be noisy ones. The clustering algorithm has\nbeen applied for each day (out of the 33 days) and the summarization is performed on the largest clusters in each day.\nThe maximum summarization word count is set to 20 words and the TextRank based method is used for this task. The\nresulted summary for each day contains two or three sentences.\n4.2 Experimental Results and discussion\nThis section presents the experimental results. Before revealing the outputs, we should note some points . First point\nis that the evaluation is performed on the subset of 20% of the samples. The second point is that we use TF-IDF\nfor baseline comparison. Finally, the same clustering method (K-means) and summarization technique (using same\nTextRank as described in sec. 2.3) are applied to TF-IDF approach. For LDA its default setup is used for comparison.\n4.3 Model Results\nFigure 8 denotes the UMAP visualization of the tweets embedding of the most representative cluster for four days in\nour dataset. This ﬁgure shows ﬁve major clusters for each day. The presented UMAP dimensionality reduction shows\nthe separability of clusters. Considering overlaps of all clusters on a major topic (covid19), this topic separation is\nan advantage. Figures 9 (a) and (b) illustrate the visualization results of TF-IDF and our approach for the ﬁrst day\nof dataset. As we can see our approach provides more distinctive groups in this cluster. For the sake of comparison\nand producing a baseline for this dataset, we keep the original pipeline and use TF-IDF instead of universal sentence\nencoder. As it can be derived from the Figure 9 (a), the clusters created by TF-IDF are more separable and it is because\nof TF-IDF nature. But in case of output results, it did not have better result compared to our approach because of\nits inability to capture semantic relevance of inter-topic a irrelevance of out of topic texts. In another word, TF-IDF\n1https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/5\n6\ncompletely separates topics that we know is not correct due to the fact that there are signiﬁcant overlaps among topics\nFigure 9 (b) proves that our approach separates topics by considering their overlapping. That means our approach\nobtains overlapping communities in which the tweets have the same topics.\nFigure 8: UMAP visualization of topics for each day; we dropped the outliers of each cluster for better visualization.\nSummarized text obtained by our method for each topic for all days is presented in Table 4. Table 1 demonstrates the\nresulting topics and extracted keywords using TF-IDF, which can be compared to Table 2 for the ﬁrst date of dataset\nincident. These tables prove that using universal sentence encoder not only enables a better clustering result, but also\nmakes a better summary of each cluster than TF-IDF approach. The obtained keywords also are another evidence to\nconﬁrm USE_T works better than TF-IDF. USE_T suggests meaningful keywords which discover main topics in tweets.\nWhile, TF-IDF can’t capture semantics and detect the most relevant keywords that represent the topic of the cluster.\na.\n b.\nFigure 9: Cluster results using UMAP dimensionality reduction for the ﬁrst day of dataset: a. TFIDF; b. Our Approach\nTable 3 shows the quantitative results of our approach compared to LDA and TF-IDF. We used the labeled version of\nthe dataset for this comparison. Top 10 precision, recall and f1 measure are used as metrics. From this table, it is clearly\nseen that our approach made over 11 and 27 percent improvements compared to LDA and TF-IDF respectively.\n4.4 Discussion\nAs it is clear from the visualization outputs of TF-IDF, the clusters tend to be at the very same center or they are\nsome noisy looking points around a centroid. In case of our approach, the clusters are divided into more separated\nsub-groups. The reason is that our approach considers and obtains semantic features by utilizing the USE_T for\ngenerating embeddings while TF-IDF produces raw vectorization. On the other hand, the result of TF-IDF in table\n1 shows that it is merging topics that are not combinable. In contrast, in our approach, the clusters can be combined,\nbecause of semantic relativity and the dot product similarity metric, which in the case of TF-IDF no such approach\nwould be applicable. Brieﬂy, the partitions originated by our proposed method is more meaningful than TF-IDF due to\nextracting more semantic features from text and considering overlaps between topics.\n7\nDate/Topic No. Topic Summary Topic Keywords\n2020-03-29/1 US desperately needs to start doing this to help prioritize\nwhere to send new vents Farm across the road, all day\nFriday, yesterday, & today, sound tractors.\nday; US; help;\n2020-03-29/2 *Highly contagious, deadly virus in the UK* Some idiot:\n\"Let’s send every house in the country a letter.\" *Touches\nmillions of letters* Last night, together with local sup-\nporters, we distributed cooked food to 200 families in\nAhmedabad, Gujarat.\ncontagious; virus; house;\n2020-03-29/3 I know lots of people are saying and feeling this but you\ncan never say thank you enough- thank you to all the\nessential workers, especially health care, pharmacies &\ngrocers.\npeople; pharmacy; health;\nTable 1: TFIDF results of proposed pipeline.\nDate/Topic No. Topic Summary Topic Keywords\n2020-03-29/1 Here are yesterday’s state by state numbers: This might be\nrelevant information for a certain world leader in a country\ncalled the “United” states of America.\nnumbers; US; leader;\n2020-03-29/2 People may get infected, possibly even die because of\nselﬁsh, stupid idiots like this.\ninfected; die; selﬁsh;\nTable 2: Results of our proposed approach.\nMoreover, the semantically close points from output of USE_T shows groups of near text representations that are\ncentered around speciﬁc centroids with some kind of noise around them. While in case of TF-IDF, the noise is all\nover the reduced dimension output and no visually detectable center points are available (discarding the same points\ntransformed to same location in some points that means they were the very same sentences with very close or same\nwords).\nAnother deduction from the results is that due to the emphasis of USE_T on semantic representation of tweets, it\nproduces better quality and meaningful summaries of each topic cluster rather than TF-IDF method, which considers\nstatistics of words of the tweets. Also, our approach ﬁnds keywords that better present the most relevant topics contained\nin the cluster.\nClustering or topic detection based on bag-of-words methods and sparse term frequency vectorization such as TFIDF\ncannot capture semantic relations. LDA on the other hand, lacks the same capability. Results from table 3 obviously\nshows this gap between our approach and these two methods.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this work, we proposed a trending topic detection framework using a method that combines the Transformers with\ntext summarization in a smart way, and applied that to COVID-19 related Tweets on Twitter. First, the sentence\nembeddings are extracted using Transformer. Then these embeddings are fed into a clustering algorithm to group\nsimilar Tweets, and ﬁnally text summarization is applied to all sentences of a each cluster to provde a short summary of\nthat. This framework can provide us the resulting topics in the form of concise sentences that are easier to read and\ncomprehend for human. This approach is applied to COVID-19 pandemic dataset collected from twitter, and several\nexperimental studies are performed to assess its performance. Through experimental comparison, we showed that this\nmodel outperforms other popular topic detection approaches, based on TF-IDF, and LDA.\nMethod P@10 Re@10 F1@10\nOur Approach 0.67 0.58 0.62\nTFIDF 0.31 0.41 0.35\nLDA 0.54 0.49 0.51\nTable 3: The quantitative comparison of the performance of the proposed model and two popular baseline for topic\nextraction.\n8\nReferences\n[1] https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/.\n[2] Bennett Kleinberg, Isabelle van der Vegt, and Maximilian Mozes.
