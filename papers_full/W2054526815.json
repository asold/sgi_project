    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the causes of magnetic reluctance in silicon steel wound cores with multi step-lapped joint structures through the appropriate exploitation of simulated and experimental local flux distributions in an air-gapped core, to propose techniques that can enable the reduction of the resulting core loss and vibration. The magnetic magnetostriction forces in the lap-joint regions, constituting another significant source of permeability, can be controlled by rearranging the step-lapped joint structure. Then, the computed local flux distributions were compared with experimental data. Single-phase pad-mounted distribution transformers with a capacity of 167 kVA were used in this study. It is indicated that the multi-step lap joint can significantly reduce the core loss and exciting power by regulating the configuration of adjacent air-gapped distances. Finally, composite-core structures were also used to validate the reduction of magnetostriction, core loss, and vibrations, corresponding to single-phase distribution transformer.",
