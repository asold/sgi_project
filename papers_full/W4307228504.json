In addition to drug delivery \nmediated by dynamic behavior, functional “delivery” based on the natural cell themselves is also involved. \nAiming to make the best use of the functions of cells, providing clues for the development of advanced \ndrug delivery platforms. \nKey words: Natural cell, Biomimetic cellular transformers, Digestive system cancer, Cancer targeting, Transformation \nIntroduction \nDigestive system tumors mainly include \nesophageal cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer \n(CRC), pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma \n(HCC) and biliary tract cancer, and are the most \ncommon cause of cancer death worldwide. Its \nmorbidity and mortality are in the fore front of \nmalignant tumors [1]. There were n early 6 million \nnew cases of digestive system malignancies \nworldwide in 2020 [2]. At present, the main treatment \nmethods for early and mid- stage digestive system  \ncancer are still surgery and postoperative adjuvant \nchemoradiotherapy. The most common cancer \ntreatment strategy is chemotherapy. However, \nchemotherapeutic drugs often have disadvantages \nsuch as poor water solubility, low tumor targeting \nability, and seve re adverse reactions, which greatly \nlimit their clinical applications [3]. At the same time, \nbecause most cases are found in the late stage of the \ndisease, the effective treatment methods are very \nlimited, resulting in a high fatality rate [4 -7]. \nTherefore, exploring new therapeutic methods for \ndigestive system cancer has become a hotspot of \ncurrent research. \nThrough decades of research, nanotechnology \nhas shown great potential in diagnosing and treating \nvarious diseases [8,9]. However, the immune system \ndistinguishes most synthetic nanocarriers as foreign \nsubstances and eliminates them [10,11]. Surface \nmodification of nanoparticles can prolong their \ncirculation time in blood and achieve specific \n \nIvyspring  \nInternational Publisher \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7081 \ntargeting, but this complicates their preparation [12]. \nAs a r esult of their dynamic interactions or \ninformation exchanges with body systems, natural \ncells are emerging as the optimal drug delivery \nplatform [13]. \nAdditionally, the cell surfac e has specific \nsignaling molecules, which can drive to the disease \nsite, and can also dynamically alter its own \nmorphology, secretion capacity or polarization state \naccording to endogenous or exogenous factors [14]. \nThe process of dynamic transformation ca n occur \nnaturally, such as self -extrusion of red blood cells \nwhen passing through narrow capillaries, morpholo -\ngical changes of neutrophils passing through \nintercellular spaces and the release of extracellular \ntraps, extracellular membrane vesicles with pa rent \ncell genetic material and function secreted by cells of \ndifferent origins, as well as the interconversion and \nhomeostasis of various phenotypes of macrophages in \nvivo [15]. On the other hand, from the perspective of \n“cargo”, in addition to specific substances, various \nfunctional components of the cell itself can likewise be \ndelivered as “cargo”, and the resulting functional \ntransmission is also particularly important in  \nintercellular information communication. The \ntransmission of these functions is usually carried out \nby the transport of extracellular vesicles, such as \ninformation transmission driven by molecular \nmessengers such as eicosanoids, cytokines and \nvarious chem okines. In lipid bilayers, fluidity and \ncytoskeletal dynamics dictate the dynamics of \nprocesses and their role in the vast majority of \nphysiopathological processes in the cell is essential \n[16-19]. Furthermore, the unique dynamic \ntransformation properties of natural cells combined \nwith advanced bioconjugation chemistry, nano-\ntechnology and biotechnology can provide clues for \nthe development of efficient drug delivery platforms \n[20,21]. \nHere, we review dynamic drug delivery systems \nwhich use cells with trans formable behavior instead \nof conventional nano-  or cellular carriers. In this \nreview, four categories of dynamic carriers of cells are \ncovered according to their transformation behavior \n(Figure 1): morphological deformation of erythrocytes \nand neutrophils,  vesicle secretion, macrophage \npolarization, and semi -biological hybrid cells, to \npromote further progress in this field. \n1. Morphology deformation-based \ncellular carriers \nPhysiological and pathological changes  of the \nbody often cause changes in the number or quality \n(function) of blood cells, and then lead to anemia, \nfever, infection, bleeding and vascular embolism and \nother clinical symptoms, and seriously affect the \ncommunication of information and material t ransfer \nbetween cells [22,23]. In the microvascular system, \nwhen red blood cells flow through narrow capillaries, \ndue to shear stress, red blood cells will undergo \ncompression and deformation in capillaries, thus \npromoting material exchange between red blood cells \nand surrounding tissues [24,25]. In tumor micro - \nenvironment (TME), neutrophils release cytokines \n \n \nFigure 1. Schematic representation of biomimetic cellular transformers. \n\nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7082 \nand other special messengers to enhance the ability of \ntumor cells to metastasize [26]. Subsequently, \nneutrophils are activated by inflammation and T ME \nto metastasize and accumulate in tumor tissue [27]. In \naddition, neutrophils have multiple receptors on their \nsurfaces, thus facilitating drug enrichment at the \ntumor site when neutrop hils’ membranes interact \nwith chemokines and adhesion factors in the tumor \nmicroenvironment [28]. \n1.1. Red blood cell membrane \nThe red blood cells (RBCs) in our bodies circulate \nfor a long time, lasting about 100 to 120 days [29]. The \nlong-term circulation effect of erythrocytes is \nmediated by a series of membrane proteins on the \nsurface of the cell membrane, among which \nintegrin-related protein CD47 plays a key role [30]. \nCD47 is expressed on erythrocyte membrane and, as a \nself-protective protein, can recognize signal \nregulatory protein -α (SIRP- α) on macrophage \nmembrane and  send inhibitory signals to prevent \nphagocytosis of macrophages [31,32]. In addition, the \ndouble concave disc -shaped structure of mature red \nblood cells is anuclear and less rigid structure, so it is \neasier to deform than other cells [33]. When the \nosmotic pressure of the surrounding medium \ndecreases, RBCs can become cup -shaped and finally \nform a sphere. This swelling characteristic is the key \nto combine RBCs with drugs or other chemicals [34]. \nThe modification of traditional nanoparticles (NPs) on \nthe surf ace of red blood cell carrier is a new bionic \nstrategy to improve the half-life of drugs in vivo. \nThe surface area of a single RBC membrane \nreaches 160 μm\n2, which can be used as a good drug \nloading platform, and the conjugation of drugs onto \nthe RBCs membr ane can reduce the damage to the \nstructure and function of RBCs to some extent [35] . It \ncan not only load various small molecular \ncompounds, but also macromolecular compounds \nsuch as proteins and nucleic acids, and its membrane \nfluidity provides better fle xibility when passing \nthrough narrow capillaries [36,37]. However, the high \nspecificity of conjugating RBCs to drugs by means of \nmembrane surface attachment leads to a lower range \nof potential indications. At present, the major forms of \nconjugation current ly include the erythropoietin \nreceptor (EPO R) mediated linkage [38], the RBCs \ncomplement receptor type I (E -CR1) mediated l \nlinkage, the avidin -biotin mediated linkage [39], and \nlinkage via chemical bonds. Magnani et al. found that \nthe cell activity of bio tin acylation by biotin \nN-hydro⁃succinimide ester (NHS biotin) is the best, \nthe recovery rate of RBCs can reach more than 90%, \nabout 1000 biotins are connected to each RBCs \nmembrane, and the activity is not affected for 24 hours \nin vivo [40]. Glutaraldehyde, as a commonly used cell \ncross-linking and fixative agent, can cross- link with \nproteins on the cell membrane and increase its \nstability, thereby avoiding RBCs hemolysis, and also \nslow down the drug loss from the cell, while having \nsome targeting propert ies [41]. Animal experiments \nconfirmed that RBCs  carrier treated with high \nconcentrations of glutaraldehyde could target to the \nliver, whereas those treated with low concentrations \nof glutaraldehyde target to the spleen. However, the \nosmotic fragility of the RBCs carrier treated by this \nmethod is increased, the cell deformability is reduced, \nand it is difficult to pass through the narrow \ncapillaries. Band 3 protein (Band\n3) cross -links into \nclusters on the membrane of senescent or degenerated \nRBCs, promotes the connection of IgG, and is more \neasily phagoc ytosed by macrophages. Therefore, \nRBCs carriers treated with Band\n3 cross-linking reagent \nhave macrophage targeting properties. Lotero et al . \ntreated RBCs carriers carrying etoposide with \nbis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS 3) and in vitro  \nresults showed that  macrophage phagocytosis \nincreased from 3% to 11%. The in vivo  results showed \nthat the treated RBCs carriers were liver-targeted due \nto the strong attachment of the Band3 to macrophages \n[42]. \nIn addition to using cross-linking agent to couple \ndrugs to RBCs  membrane, adsorbing drugs to RBCs  \nmembrane is also an effective drug loading strategy. \nBrenner et al. developed a “red blood cell hitchhiking \n(RH)” technology, which adsorbs drug loaded NPs \nonto RBCs and then infuses them to patients through \nintravenous i njection or arterial intubation ( Figure \n2a). After entering the blood circulation, the NPs are \ndesorbed from the RBCs  membrane under the \ninfluence of blood flow shear stress or in direct \ncontact with endothelial cells ( Figure 2b). The results \nshow that RH can deliver NPs to various types of cells \non the surface of capillary lumen, and the type of cells \nto which NPs are delivered depends on the \npathophysiological environment. This new drug \ndelivery technology can accurately deliver nano drug \ncarriers to selected organs by placing intravascular \ncatheters in animal or human lungs, while avoiding \nRBCs hemolysis or toxicity to target organs, and has \ngood biocompatibility [43]. \nIn addition to oxygen transport, RBCs have a \nvariety of additional immunological related functions. \nResearchers have found that RBCs can bring immune \ncomplexes and bacteria from the circulatory system to \nliver macrophages and professional anti gen \npresenting cells (APCs) in the spleen by capturing \nthem on their surface. Through exploiting RBC 's \nunique ability to present antigens in the spleen, \nAnvay Ukidve et al. developed strategies to generate \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7083 \ncellular and humoral immune responses against \nantigens. Researchers designed a RBCs hitchhiking \nsystem to mainly deliver the attached NPs to the \nspleen but not the lungs, thereby activating cellular \nimmunity and humoral immunity, and they termed \nthis process as erythrocyte -driven immune targeting \n(EDIT). Specifically, the researchers coat surfaces of \npolystyrene carboxylate (PS -COOH) with ovalbumin \n(OVA) as a model antigen using 1 -ethyl-3-(3- \ndimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) chemistry \nto generate protein -capped NP s attached to RBCs. \nDendritic cells found all particles to be monodisperse \nand easily internalized and activated by them. As \nmentioned earlier, particulate matter can be removed \nfrom the lungs with RH technology because shear \nstress is experienced by R BCs undergoing \ndeformation in the lung capillaries. Increasing the \nNPs to RBCs  dosing ratio helps to improve the shear \nresistance in the lun gs, thus allowing more NP s to be \ntargeted to the spleen or other sites [44]. \nDespite improving the targeting and safety of \ndrug delivery, RH strategy still has some problems: 1) \nNPs are not firmly connected to RBCs and easy to \nundergo desorption . 2) At present, the use of RH \nstrategy to achieve the targeting of organs such as \nheart and brain requires the aid of arterial vascular \ncannulation, which is not suitable for chronic, \noutpatient treatment of diseases [45]. 3) Construction \nof hitchhiking RBCs drug loading systems requires \nmultiple steps such as RBCs isolation, ex vivo loading \nand reinfusion of RBCs, or infusion of donor RBCs, \neach of which can have an impact on the final yield. \nThe adhesion of NPs to RBCs is the basis of the RH \nstrategy, but due to the small surface area to volume \nratio of RBCs, there is also the problem that the drug \nloading is difficult to increase [46]. 4) Currently, there \nis a lack of studies on the di stribution of NPs \ntransferred from RBCs carrier to the vascular cells in \nthe vasculature of addressee organs [47]. 5) In the RH \nstrategy, NPs nonspecifically attach to random \ncomponents of the RBCs membrane, which may affect \nthe normal function of RBCs. However, a spectrum of \naffinities to the RBCs may also arise. Understanding \nthis aspect and designing selective coupling of NPs to \ncarrier RBCs may enable specific transfer to intended \nvascular areas and cells [47,48]. Although the \napplication of RH strategy  in clinic is still immature, \nits advantages still cannot be ignored. By adjusting \nthe ratio of NPs to RBCs, a drug delivery system \ntargeting different organs may be successfully \nconstructed. Besides, using the innate immune \nfunction of RBCs to design NPs for transfer to the \nspleen provides an alternative format for delivering \nNPs to the spleen, avoiding excessive modification of \nNPs. The immune memory induced by EDIT can \ncontinuously drive therapeutic responses. As a \ngeneral strategy, combining RH strategy  with tumor \nimmunotherapy may provide new hope for treating \nsolid tumors such as digestive system cancers. \n1.2 Neutrophils cell membrane \nNeutrophils account for about 50% ~ 70% of the \ntotal number of leukocytes and are the most abundant \nleukocytes in human body [49]. As the first responder \nof inflammatory signals, neutrophils will be \n“captured” by selectin (SEL) synthesized by vascular \nendothelial cel ls when flowing rapidly in the blood, \nmaking it roll slowly along the inner surface of blood \nvessels, detecting inflammatory signals such as \ncomplement fragment C5a and lipopolysaccharide \n(LPS), and then rapidly expressing integrin (INT). INT \ninteracts wit h intercellular cell adhesion molecule -1 \n(ICAM-1) expressed on the surface of endothelial \ncells. Then a chemokine signal causes neutrophils to \nstop rolling and migrate toward the site of \ninflammation by passing through the vascular \nendothelium [50]. Although the spacing between \nendothelial cells is not enough for a cell to pass \nthrough, neutrophils can be deformed by squeezing \nitself through the cell gap. This is also known as \n \n \nFigure 2. Clinically translatable nanocarriers adsorb onto red blood cells. (a) Procedural steps of RBC hitchhiking. NCs are first adsorbed onto the RBCs ex vivo.

However, excessive neutro -\nphils infiltration is also the  main reason for the \ncontinuous deterioration of some diseases. \nResearchers have found neutrophils infiltration in a \nvariety of tumor models [51 -55]. Chemokines and \ncytokines produced by tumor cells and the \nsurrounding microenvironment will actively recrui t \nneutrophils. Neutrophils express chemokine receptors \nCXCR1 and CXCR2 [56], and tumor cells express the \nligands of these receptors, thereby promoting the \nrecruitment of tumor associated neutrophils. \nNeutrophils can also interact with circulating tumor \ncells (CTCs) through adhesion molecules on cells and \nneutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to promote \ntumor metastasis [57,58]. Therefore, neutrophils can \nbe used as a good provider of tumor targeted cell \nmembrane biomimetic materials [59]. \nThe use of neutrop hils to deliver drugs or NPs \ngenerally takes two forms. The first is to assemble NPs \ninto neutrophils in vitro . However, in practical \napplications, due to the short lifespan (~ 7 h) of \nneutrophils, intracellular degradation of drugs, \ninsufficient number of  obtained cells, and the \npotential for in vitro contamination, these methods are \nnot effective [60]. The second is to use NPs to \n“hitchhiking” neutrophils in situ  (i.e., during blood \ncirculation). Although this approach is more \nbeneficial to clinical practice, it is crucial that NPs are \ndesigned to have high affinity for neutrophils. Li et al. \nconstructed a strategy based on pathogen mimicking \nnano-pathogenoids (NPNs) to “hitchhiking” \ncirculating neutrophils, and combined photothermal \ntherapy to enhance the  recruitment of neutrophils by \nNPNs from the blood circulation and the ability to \neliminate residual tumor cells [61]. The researchers \nfirst constructed NPNs by coating bacteria -secreted \nouter membrane vesicles (OMVs) collected from E. \ncoli on NPs by extrusion method. During \nphotothermal therapy (PTT), the chemokines \nproduced stimulate the neutrophi ls and inform them \nof the tumor’s location. Pathogen- associated \nmolecular patterns (PAMPs) on NPNs are sensed and \nrecognized by pattern recogniti on receptors (PRR) on \nneutrophils to “hitchhiking” circulating neutrophils, \non the basis of which biological barriers are overcome \nand actively accumulate at the tumor site. After NPNs \nenter tumor tissue, in the process of forming \nneutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), NPNs are \nreleased from neutrophils when plasma membranes \nare destroyed and internalized by tumor cells to exert \nanti-tumor effect ( Figure 3 ). Real -time intravital \nmicroscopy was used to examine the migration \npatterns of neutrophils in PTT -treated tumors, thus \nconfirming that chemotaxis of neutrophils to tumors \ncan overcome certain biological drug delivery \nbarriers. Within 2 hours after PTT, a large number of \nneutrophils aggregated into tumors. In enlarged \nregion I, the shape of neutrophils cha nged from oval \nto irregular as it moved slowly along blood vessels, \nsometimes adhering to vessel walls. In enlarged \nregion II, when neutrophils are elongated, they can \nmove more freely in small capillaries, allowing them \nto be evenly distributed throughout  the tissue. In \naddition, neutrophils on blood vessels also enter the \ninterstitium by elongating and squeezed through \nendothelial cells. The above results all indicated that \nthe recruited neutrophils could cross the vascular \nbarrier in a dynamic deformatio n manner and \nincrease the distribution in the tumor tissue \ninterstitium. The researchers further induced an \ninflammatory environment with PMA medium and \nverified that the encapsulated drugs could be released \nfrom neutrophils. The mechanism of its release l ies in \nthe dynamic deformation of activated neutrophils and \neventually form NETs, which indicates the plasma \nmembrane of neutrophils has disintegrated, thereby \nleading to the final release of the drug. Further results \nfrom in vivo experiments confirmed that PTT-induced \ninflammation led to the release of encapsulated NPs \nby NETs, followed by its eventual endocytosis by \ntumor cells. Usually, as a result of the limited \npenetration of light through tumor tissue, the uneven \ndistribution of heat simply retards tu mor growth but \ndoes not eliminate it completely, the result was a \nrecurrence and metastasis of the tumor. By combining \nPTT and chemotherapeutic drugs, NPNs dislodge \ncirculating tumor inducing neutrophils in situ, thereby \neradicating tumors in all treated m ice. This method \nalso provides new ideas for improving nanomedicine \ndelivery and tumor therapy [61]. \n1.3 Stem cell membrane \nStem cells are a type of pluripotent cells with \nself-replication ability. Studies have shown that \ncytokines and chemokines secreted by tumor cells can \ninduce the enrichment of stem cells into tumor tissue \n[62]. Therefore, many types of stem cells, such as bone \nmarrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), \ncan be used to construct tumor targeted nano-\nmedicines. MSCs have a strong abili ty to orientate \nmalignant lesions, that is, the homing characteristics \nof stem cells. When ischemic, hypoxic, or injured, \nbody endogenous or exogenous stem cells have the \ntrait of directional migration toward the site of injury \nand distribution [63]. The homing mechanism of stem \ncells is a multi- step and coordinated process, which \nmainly involves chemokine receptor interactions, \nadhesion of endothelial cells, and so on [64]. \nChemokines released by tumor and tumor associated \nstromal cells attract BMSCs with corresponding \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7085 \nreceptors against a concentration gradient to reach the \ntumor site [65]. After stem cells are mobilized and \nmigrated, their vascular cell adhesion molecule \n(VCAM) and intercellular adhesion molecule \n(ICAM-1) interact with endothelial cells to allow stem \ncells to adhere to the capillary wall for targeting \nacross the endothelial cell layer to the tumor site by \nextrusion deformation [66]. MSCs are easy to isolate \nand culture in vitro , and encapsulating nanoparticles \nwith stem cell membrane can endow the nanocarrier \nwith active targeting property, which can specifically \naccumulate in the tumor site , reduce the damage to \nthe body’ s normal tissues and improve the \ntherapeutic efficacy. \n \n \nFigure 3. Schematic illustration showing the chemotaxis-driven delivery of NPNs for complete eradication of tumors post-phototherapy. #1a The released G-CSF and GM-CSF \nincreased neutrophil production from bone marrow. #1b The released CXCL1 and MIP-2 broadcasted the location of the inflamed tumor. #2 Neutrophils entered the blood \ncirculation and encountered the injected NPNs. #3  Neutrophils sensed NPNs with the recognition of LPS and lipoprotein by  TLRs and subsequently engulfed them. #4 \nNeutrophils laden with NPNs were recruited into the tumor site in response to the chemokine gradient through the following cascade: adhesion, crawling and transmigration. \n#5 NPNs were released from neutrophils to kill tumor cells along with the formation of NETs in the inflamed tumor.

Copyright Year 2020, \nSpringer Nature. \n\nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7086 \nTo reduce the systemic toxicity of doxorubicin \n(DOX), Liu et al . constructed a MSCs membrane \nencapsulated DOX superparamagnetic iron oxide \n(SPIO) NPs for colorectal cancer treatment. \nDOX-SPIO@MSCs with the biological function of \nMSCs membrane, thus achieving highly efficient \ndelivery of intracellular drugs, prolonging  serum \nhalf-life, and actively targeting to the tumor site. \nCompared with free DOX and DOX- SPIO, \nDOX-SPIO@MSCs can not only avoid the premature \nclearance of drugs by the mononuclear phagocyte \nsystem, but also have stronger targeting to the MC38 \nxenograft tumor. The anti -tumor treatment efficiency \nwas significantly improved without obvious systemic \ntoxicity [67]. Compared with BMSCs, human \numbilical cord derived MSCs are popular sources \nbecause of their stemness, ease of acquisition, high \nrate of proliferati on, and provision of abundant \nplasma membranes. Yang et al. noted that PLGA NPs \nencapsulated by umbilical cord derived MSCs could \nenhance the uptake of DOX, and the results showed \nthat the uptake efficiency of membrane coated NPs by \ntumor cells was 3 times higher than that of membrane \nuncoated NPs. Moreover, encapsulation of umbilical \ncord derived MSCs improved the release efficiency of \nDOX at acidic microenvironment and inhibited \nMHCC97H subcutaneously tumor growth in nude \nmice with liver cancer [68]. Notably, stem cells exhibit \ndifferent growth impacts for different tumor models, \nsuggesting that the targeting ability of stem cell \nmembrane biomimetic NPs may be tumor -specific \nand not applicable to all tumor types [69]. At the same \ntime, it is still necessar y to further confirm whether \nthe stem cell carrier has the risk of promoting tumor \ngrowth or even metastasis, so its clinical application \nstill needs further exploration. \n2 Cellular dynamic release-based delivery \nUnder physiological and pathological \nconditions, almost all kinds of microorganisms or \nmammalian cells will dynamically release \nextracellular vesicles (EV s). EV s are diverse \nmembranous vesicles derived from endosomes and \ncell membranes released by cells into the extracellular \nenvironment [70]. As e arly as 1976, Allan et al . found \nthat RBCs release EVs from their surface [71]. EVs can \nnot only participate in the transport of biomolecules \nsuch as lipids, proteins and RNA between cells, but \nalso mediate the transmission of information between \ncells in biological system [72 -74]. EVs can be divided \ninto exosomes, microvesicles (MVs), apoptotic bodies, \nsynaptoneurosomes and other types [75,76]. The \ndiversity of EVs stems from its different production \nmechanisms [77]. Because EVs mediate the \ncommunication b etween cells, have the ability of \nmaterial loading and certain targeted homing ability, \nand have high biocompatibility and can exist stably in \nvivo, research on EVs and drug delivery has increased \ngradually in the recent years [78]. Therapeutic drugs \ncan be loaded into EVs in various ways. A comparison \nof the advantages and disadvantages of each drug \nloading method is shown in Table 1. In addition, EVs \nhave lipid bilayers, so lipid -soluble molecules can be \nanchored and inserted into the membrane. Combined \nwith cell membrane surface modification technology, \nfunctionalized EVs can be obtained, which further \nexpands the application of EVs as drug carrier [79]. \nThis part will focus on the bionic drug delivery \nsystem based on the dynamic release of these cells. \n \nTable 1.

The \nrelease of EVs is considered to be an important \nregulator of cell-cell interaction and has a wide range \nof physiological functions [92] . It can be used as \nantigen to bind to receptor cells, and can also be used \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7087 \nas carrier to deliver functional substances to receptor \ncells, such as protein, nucleic acid, DNA, mRNA and \nnon-coding RNA. Receptor cells can interact with EVs \nthrough several active uptake modes, including \nmembrane fusion, receptor- mediated endocytosis, \nendocytosis and phagocytosis [93]. The characteristics \nof EVs are different depending on the source cells \n[94]. The EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells \n(MSCs) can transfer many components such as genetic \nmaterial and drugs. Their homing ability to \ninflammatory sites can also have a variety of effects on \ntumor growth [95]. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can \nremain undifferentiated for a long time in the process \nof in vitro culture, so as to generate EVs with stable \ncharacteristics, which can be used as drug carriers for \nthe development of new cancer therapeutic drugs. \nMacrophage derived EVs can penetrate the \nblood-brain barrier, interact with and accumulate in \ncancer cells [96]. Tumor derived EVs have also \nattracted the attention of many researchers. Its tumor \ntargeting homing property e nables drugs to reach \ncancer cells effectively, which not only protects \ntherapeutic drugs from degradation, but also has low \nimmunogenicity [97]. Dendritic cell- derived EVs \ncontain a variety of antigen-presenting molecules and \ncostimulatory molecules, which can activate T cells, \nenhance the function of natural killer cells, and \npromote the eradication of tumors [98]. In addition to \nthe above characteristics, the main advantage of EVs \nas drug carriers is that they can effectively load \ntherapeutic drugs witho ut significantly changing \nmembrane structure and surface proteins, and have \nstability, biocompatibility, targeting and the ability to \novercome natural barriers in blood circulation. They \nalso have immune tolerance and can overcome the \nlimitations of synthe sizing NPs. Based on the above \nadvantages, extracellular vesicles have become a \npromising tool for drug delivery [92,99-101]. \nInspired by EVs mediated intercellular \ncommunication, Silva et al . constructed a hybrid \ncarrier consisting of macrophage derived EVs \nencapsulating different therapeutic agents and iron \noxide NPs to achieve spatial control of drug delivery. \nStudies have found that under a magnetic field, the \nuptake of EVs by tumor c ells can be dynamically \nregulated and spatially controlled, and that magnetic \ntargeting enhances tumor cell death with attenuated \ntoxic side effects [102]. \nWith endogenous exosomes, immune reactions \ncan be avoided. Nevertheless, the efficiency of \nexosome delivery depends on both the parent and the \nrecipient cells, and native exosomes have difficulties \nlocating their target cells [103]. T o meet the \nexperimental needs, the technology of constructing \nengineered exosomes by  surface modification has \nemerged [104]. To precisely target therapeutic drugs \nto lesions, chemical attachment of targeting peptides, \ngenetic engineering of exosome membranes, magnetic \nnanoparticle technology, electrostatic interactions and \npost-insertion have become a common method in \nrecent years [105,106]. In order to produce the precise \nand improved therapeutic effect, Tamura R et al . \nmodified exosomes with cationic amylopectin to \ntarget asialoglycoprotein receptors on hepatocytes \n[107]. As an alternative method, Lee J et al . treated \nparental cells with azide membrane -fused liposomes \n(MFL) to create azide exosomes that were then \nconjugated with a tumor targeting peptide conjugate \nDBCO-CGKPK via bioorthogonal reaction [108]. MFL \nexogenously incorporated into exosomes for surface \nmodification does not damage membrane proteins \ncritical to the exosomes’ biological function (Figure 4). \n2.2 Extracellular vesicles of plant or microbial \norigin as dynamic carriers \nThe majority of studies at present focus on EVs \nderived from animal cells . However, the production \nefficiency of EVs derived from animal cells is low, and \nonly a few micrograms can be obtained in billions of \ncells [109]. Therefore, it is usually necessary to culture \n \n \nFigure 4. Liposome-based cellular engineering for efficient intracellular packaging of cargo in extracellular vesicles.

Compared with EVs of \nanimal origin, a major benefit of EVs derived from \nplants or microorganisms is that they can be produced \nin larger quantities as well as having a higher \neconomic benefit. Not only that, p lant-derived \nexosome-like nanoparticles (PDENs), which are often \nenriched in various bioactive lipid, protein, RNA, and \nother components, are natural nano-formulations that \nare proven to have significant regulatory roles in \ncancer, immunomodulation, and a ntiviral versus \nantioxidant effects [110]. For example, Zhu et al. found \nthat after oral administration of ginger derived EVs in \nmice, they mainly accumulated in the liver and \nmesenteric lymph nodes, and could inhibit ROS \nproduction when acting on hepatocy tes [111]. Citrus \nderived EVs can participate in regulating the gene \nexpression of tight junction proteins, thereby \nrestoring intestinal barrier function [112]. Grape \nderived EVs accelerate the repair of intestinal mucosa \nepithelium by regulating the expre ssion of genes that \npromote the growth and proliferation of intestinal \nstem cells through Wnt signaling pathway [113]. \nBroccoli derived EVs can target dendritic cells (DCs) \nto activate AMP -activated protein kinase (AMPK) in \nDCs, thereby reducing the releas e of IFN -γ and \nTNF-α. It can prevent the activation of intestinal DCs \nand improve the symptoms of DSS induced colitis in \nmice [114]. Lemon derived EVs can inhibit the \nproliferation of cancer cells by promoting tumor \nnecrosis factor related apoptosis induci ng ligand \n(TRAIL) - mediated apoptosis and inhibiting the \nsecretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A \n(VEGF-A), IL -6 and IL -8 [115]. Lentinus edodes \nderived EVs can alleviate D -galactosamine/ \nlipopolysaccharide induced liver injury in mice by \ninhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome \n[116]. At the same time, in addition to their inherent \ntherapeutic potential, source plants possess low \ntoxicity and safety characteristics, making them ideal \nvehicles for delivering drugs and genes, with broad \napplication prospects [117]. \nPDENs have been successfully reported for oral \ncolon-targeted drug delivery [118]. In addition, \nstudies have also shown that PDENs have good \ntolerance to digestive enzymes like pepsin, intestinal \npancreatin and bile. It allows the entrapped drugs to \nbe delivered intact to the colonic site and exert their \neffect, thus avoiding decomposition of drugs by the \ngastric or intestinal environment [110]. However, \nresearchers have not yet elucidated how PDENs can \nstill maintain drug loaded in tegrity while defending \nagainst the harsh gastrointestinal environment. A \nstudy constructed methotrexate loaded PDENs \n(GDNs) for targeting intestinal macrophages. After \noral administration of the drug loaded PDENs, the \nresults showed that in the intestinal  lamina propria, \nthese PDENs are highly efficient in targeting F4/80+ \nmacrophages via micropinocytosis and clathrin - \ndependent cellular uptake pathways. After being \ninternalized by macrophages, encapsulated \nmethotrexate was dynamically released. The result s \nshowed that pretreatment with GDNs could \neffectively prevent weight loss and intestinal segment \nshortening caused by DSS induced colitis ( Figure 5a, \nb). After treatment with GDNs, the severity and \npathological score of colitis in mice decreased ( Figure \n5c, d). The expression of E-cadherin, IL-6 and IL-1β in \ncolon epithelial cells were significantly reduced \n(Figure 5e, f ). The mRNA levels of chemokines \nMCP-1, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were also reduced \n(Figure 5g), and the inflammatory neutrophil \ninfiltration of CD11b\n+Ly6Chigh was significantly \nreduced ( Figure 5h, i ), suggesting that GDNs could \nenhance the anti -inflammatory capacity of intestinal \nimmune cells by playing the role of immune \nregulators [119]. It has been reported that curcumin \ncan be delivered to colon tissue using PDENs, and the \nPDENs enhanced both the stability and blood level of \nthe drug, resulting in its specific drug delivery to \ninflammatory cells [120], offering new treatment \noptions for colon cancer. In response to relevant \nstudies, the James G raham Brown C ancer Center \ninitiated two phase I clinical trials to test the \ntherapeutic efficacy of PDENs in head and neck \ncancer and colon cancer (NCT01668849 ,  \nNCT01294072). In addition, clinical studies on \nPDENs, multiple clinical trials on cell -free \nimmunotherapy for cancer are also underway, with a \nview to developing effective cancer vaccines in the \nfuture [121]. \nOuter membrane vesicles (OMVs) are a type of \nmembrane-shaped structure originated from the \nbacteria’s outer membrane and mainly produced by \nGram negative bacteria [122,123]. OMVs contain a \nvariety of components of bacterial origin, including \nenzymes, virulence factors, bacterial specific antigens, \nand various PAMPs, such as lipopolysaccharide \n(LPS), making them especially useful for the \ndevelopment of bacterial vaccines and adjuvants \n[124,125]. In addition, OMVs may also have antitumor \nproperties that have gradually gained attention [126]. \nOMVs can not only induce powerful tumor immune \neffects through bacterial -derived proteins, but also \nencapsulate therapeutic drugs using their own \nstructures to achieve PAMPs -mediated cell specific \ntargeting and improve drug accumulation at target \nsites [127]. \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7089 \n \nFigure 5. Grapefruit-derived nanoparticles (GDN) pretreatment ameliorates DSS -induced colitis in mice. C57/B6 mice were treated with either  PBS/DSS or GDN/DSS. \nAdapted with permission from [119]. Copyright Year 2014, Elsevier. \n \nIn order to relieve the state of tumor immuno -\nsuppression, combining the anti -tumor immune \nresponse mediated by OMVs with chemotherapeutic \ndrugs is a more effective approach. By combining \nimmunotherapy and OMVs, additional potential for \ntumor immunotherapy can be enhanced to prevent \ntumor recurrence and metastasis and compl ete \neradication of tumors. The detoxified OMVs were \nmodified by Ping et al. by adding polyethylene glycol \n(PEG) and the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide to increase \nblood circulation and improve tumor targeting. On \ntop of the tegafur -loaded NPs, modified OMVs were \ncoated, and the resulting NPs had three antitumor \nfunctions (Figure 6). As a first step following systemic \ninjection, innate immune cells are activated, followed \nby an enhanced tumor accumulation in response to \nthe EPR effect and peptide targeting by RGD . After \nbeing taken up by tumor cells, OMVs dynamically \nreleased tegafur, which enhanced the sensitivity of \ncancer cells to cytotoxic CD8\n+ T cells and eliminated \nmyeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), thereby \nsynergistically enhancing the immunothera py ability \nof OMVs [128]. Notably, OMVs -coated NPs were not \nharmful to major organs. Serum cytokine levels \nincreased rapidly within a few hours of injection and \nrapidly decreased within 24 hours, demonstrating the \nsafety of this drug delivery vehicles. \n\nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7090 \n \nFigure 6. Schematic Illustration of the Bioengineering Process of Functionalized OMV -Coated Polymeric Micelles and Their  Proposed Mechanism of Immunotherapy for \nProtective Immunity, Cancer Treatment, and Metastasis Preventiona. Adapted with permission from [128]. Copyright Year 2020, American Chemical Society. \n \nThe safety of using OMVs for cancer treatment is \na major concern. Although many studies have \ndemonstrated that the use of attenua ted or detoxified \nOMVs as drug delivery carriers are safe in mice [129] , \nhumans are several orders of magnitude more \nsensitive to endotoxin than other mammals, such as \nmice [130]. There is still no relevant report on whether \nthe human body can tolerate OMV s. The LPS of the \ncell wall of gram -negative bacteria is not only highly \ncarcinogenic but can also cause fatal septic shock \n[129]. In order to further improve the  safety of OMVs \nas drug carriers, current studies usually use the OMVs \nof attenuated or avirulent bacteria, and suppresses the \nexpression of bacterial LPS through gene mutation or \nmakes the cytoplasmic A in LPS insufficiently \nacylated, followed by genetic and surface \nmodification to target the cells of interest. There have \nbeen studies to engineer avirulent  Staphylococcus \naureus (S. aureus) mutants by genetic engineering that \nproduce avirulent cytolysins, and OMVs containing \navirulent cytolysins that are immunogenic and \nnontoxic are able to protect mice against S. aureus \n[131]. Gujrati et al. used genetic engineering to modify \nthe parental Escherichia coli  (E.coli) to reduce the \ncytotoxicity of OMVs, expressed the tumor targeting \nligand HER2 on their surface, and loaded siRNA to \ninhibit the activity of overexpressed spindle kinesin \nwithin tumor cells. Consequently, cell proliferation is \n\nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7091 \ninhibited and apoptosis is induced. The experiments \nshowed that Affi HER2OMVsiRNA was not significantly \ncytotoxic and could aggregate at the tumor site with \nhigh specificity, effectively inhibiting tumor growth \n[132]. \n2.3 Platelets as dynamic carriers \nMegakaryocytes produce small, anucleate cells \ncalled platelets, whose lifespan is about 8 ~ 10 d, and \ntheir main function is hemostasis, regulating \ninflammation, and promoting thrombosis [133]. Aside \nfrom their traditional functions, platelets can also play \nother roles such as regulating immunity and \ncommunicating with other cells and tissues in the \nblood vessels. Key to the role played by platelets is \ntheir activation, which upon activation enables the \ndynamic release of granules (platelets contain 3 types \nof granules: α particles, δ particles and lysosomal \nparticles) and EVs (microparticles 100 nm ~ 1 mm and \nexosomes 40 ~ 100 nm in diameter). It is possible that \nplatelet communication with other cells in the blood \nvessels i s achieved through microparticles. Genetic \nmaterial (miRNA, mRNA, and so on), enzymes, \nproteins, and small molecules within these \nmicroparticles can affect cells in the vasculature and \nalter their functions [134,135]. Because platelet \nmicroparticles and exosomes differ in their source and \nspecific protein composition, they may have different \nfunctions, with exosomes play the function of \nextracellular communication, platelet microparticles \nplay the role of procoagulant activity and intracellular \ncommunication that can transfer their cargo \n(cytoplasm or membrane proteins, mRNA, and \nnon-coding RNA) to target cells. This explains part of \nthe role of platelet EVs in inflammation, thrombosis, \nimmune regulation and biological information \ntransmission [136,137]. \nStudies have shown that platelets are involved in \ntumor development, including tumor growth, tumor \ncell extravasation, and metastasis, by protecting \ntumor cells from the host immune system, whereas \nplatelet effects on local and distant tumor host \ninteractions may be mediated through the secretion of \nlarge amounts of platelet microparticles and \nexosomes [138,139]. In vivo  studies have shown that \nplatelet microparticles can promote the growth of \nprimary tumors, stimulate vascularization, and \npromote the formation of distant metastases [140]. \nLevels of platelet microparticles are markedly \nelevated in a large subset of malign ancies. Colon \ncancer patients are often accompanied by altered \ncoagulation activity, and stage III/IV colon cancer \npatients have significantly increased levels of platelet \nmicroparticles in the systemic circulation, greatly \nshortened clotting time, and increased fibrin \nproduction, resulting in a hypercoagulable state in the \nblood of colon cancer patients, so platelet \nmicroparticles are potential targets for preventing \ncoagulation in colon cancer [141]. \nA great deal of attention has been paid in recent \nyears to the interactions between platelets and CTCs \nin the blood [142], and the aggregation of platelets \nsurrounding CTCs helps them survive in the \nbloodstream and invade new tissues [143]. The high \naffinity between P -selectin on platelets and CD44 \nreceptors o n tumor cells explains this specific \naggregation. Therefore, platelets are more likely to \ntarget CTCs when P -selectin binds specifically to \nCD44 [144,145]. To deliver functional small molecules \nwith precise targeting, Hu et al . created \nplatelet-mimicking n anovehicles (PM -NV) [146]. \nPM-NV consists of a small molecule drug loaded \nnanogel inner core and a platelet membrane based \nouter shell. Meanwhile, TRAIL was modified on the \nsurface of platelet membrane, and DOX was loaded \ninto PM-NV to prepare TRAIL -DOX-PM-NV. During \nin vivo experiments, PM-NV was found to contain a \nlarge amount of platelet -derived “self -recognition” \nproteins, which minimizes in vivo  immunogenicity \nand prolongs circulation time. CD44 molecules are \npresent on tumor cell membranes and can be bound \nby P -selectin carried on platelet membranes. This \nallows TRAIL-DOX-PM-NV to target tumor cells and \naccumulate at the tumor site. Meanwhile, TRAIL - \nDOX-PM-NV aggregation on tumor cell surfaces \nencourages TRAIL interaction with the membrane \nand signals exogenous apoptosis. More importantly, \nwhen TRAIL-DOX-PM-NV was internalized by cells, \nthe acidic environment of lysosomes would mediate \nTRAIL-DOX-PM-NV to dynamically release DOX, \nallowing DOX to accumulate in tumor cell nuclei and \nsynergistically induce tumor cell apoptosis (Figure 7). \nIn addition, the binding of P -selectin to CD44 can \neliminate CTCs, preventing tumor metastasis. Based \non platelet and tumor cell specific affinity, this study \nsuccessfully developed platelet membrane modified \nnanomedicines that delivered TRAIL and DOX to \ntumor cells. \nPrimary amine or thiol residues on the surface of \nplatelets enable chemical attachment to NPs or \nbiomolecules, followed by dynamic release of drug \nloaded microparticles via activation [147,148]. \nKailashiya et al. [12] constructed platelet- transformed \ndrug loaded platelet -derived microparticles (PMPs). \nThis biomimetic particle has good biocompatibility \nand natural targeting, can carry a variety of drugs, has \ngood stability, and can be obtained in large quantities  \nin a short period of time. Compared with free drugs, \nPMPs are more toxic to cancer cells and less prone to \nextravascular escape [149]. \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7092 \n \nFigure 7.

However, tumor \ncells evade immune surveillance and immune killing \nby reducing immunogenicity and enhancing immune \ntolerance, leading to a loss of balance in the \ninteraction of the tumor with the immune system \n[151]. Tumor cells establish an immunosu ppressive \nTME by secreting immunosuppressive factors and \nrecruiting immunosuppressive cells, which further \nsuppress antitumor immune responses, thus leading \nto uncontrolled tumor growth and ultimately \nlife-threatening health. Tumor associated macro-\nphages (TAMs) are important components of the \nimmunosuppressive TME [152]. The classical \nphenotype of macrophages is divided into M1, which \nis pro -inflammatory and anti -cancer, and M2, which \nis pro-cancer. TAMs are generally M2 type, therefore, \npolarizing M2 type  TAMs to M1 type is a feasible \nscheme to restore antitumor immune responses [153]. \n3.1 Macrophage polarization \nPeptides targeting M2 macrophages can be used \nto modify carriers capable of delivering drugs that \npromote macrophage transformation to achieve \nTAMs-specific regulation. Signal transducer and \nactivator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and nuclear factor \nkappa-B (NF -κB) promote M2 polarization of \nmacrophages through different mechanisms . \nTherefore, inhibition of these two signaling pathways \nmay lead to a p henotypic transformation in macro-\nphages. Xiao et al . [154] constructed a nanomedicine \nwith dual characteristics of TME response and active \ntargeting. The M2 targeting peptide was first masked \nwith pH -sensitive PEG, and then the targeting \npeptide was used to modify the STAT6 inhibitor \nAS1517499 (AS) and the inhibitor of nuclear factor \nkappa-B kinase β (IKKβ) siRNA nanomedicines to \nobtain nanocomplexes. After the nanocomplex \nreaches the tumor, the PEG protective shell falls off \nunder the weak acid condition of TME, exposing the \nM2 targeting peptide, and the loaded drug is \nspecifically delivered to M2 macrophages, which \ninduces the phenotypic polarization of M2 \nmacrophages at the same time, reduce the occurrence \nof adverse reactions, and provide safe and effec tive \nimmunotherapy. In addition, based on specific \nproteins on the surface of macrophages, Kulkarni et al. \n\nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7093 \ndesigned a protein that can specifically bind to SIRP-α \nand inhibit the colony stimulating factor -1 receptor \n(CSF-1R) through computational biology. The \nsupramolecules can self -assemble with specific \ncompounds into nanoparticles. After targeting \nmacrophages, the supramolecules can block the \nmutual binding of macrophage SIRP -α receptors and \nCD47, and block the CSF -1R signaling pathway, so \nthat TAMs are polarized to the M1 type and induce an \ninnate immune response against tumors [155]. \nSeveral classes of microbial agents and microbe \nderived molecules (e.g., bacterial muramyl dipeptide, \nIFN- γ, CD40 antibody antagonist, CP -870, 893) were \nshown to drive the  antitumor cytotoxic effects of \nmacrophages, related clinical research has also been \ncarried out, but their clinical efficacy has been modest \n[156,157]. While the continuous extension of \nnanotechnology in the field of tumor immunotherapy \nhas allowed many novel nanomedicines to be mined \nfor their potential in tumor immunotherapy, iron \noxide nanoparticles are one of them ( Figure 8). For a \nlong time, iron oxide nanoparticles have been used for \nimaging liver tumors due to the trait of specific \naggregation in li ver tissue, a property that highlights \ntheir advantages for liver tumor therapy [158,159]. Li \net al . used hyaluronic acid (HA) encapsulated \nsuperparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) to \nconstruct reprogrammed macrophages (HION@  \nMacs). In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that \nHION@Macs were able to educate in situ  M2 \nmacrophages toward M1 transition and restore their \nimmune effects via a paracrine manner. HION@Macs \nalso exhibits strong resistance to the immunosup -\npressive tumor environment, enab ling sustained \nproduction of inflammatory factors (i.e., NO, H\n2O2, \nand TNF-α) to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and \npromote their apoptosis, exerting a synergistic tumor \nsuppressive effect [160]. \nAlthough there have been many studies that \nsuccessfully induced phenotypic transformation of \nmacrophages in vivo, this strategy is still very far from \nclinical translation. Because in most cases, M1 type \nmacrophages induced to undergo polarization by in \nvitro stimulation readily revert to the M2 phenotype \nafter reaching the tumor immune microenvironment \n[161], thereby failing to generate sustained immune \nkilling. Therefore, to truly exert powerful therapeutic \neffects in the clinic, macrophage -based tumor \nimmunotherapy must develop effective strategies to \ncontrol the phenotype of adoptively transferred \nmacrophages in vivo. Based on this purpose, a cellular \n“backpack” strategy that can maintain the duration of \nM1type polarization of macrophages has emerged. \nSeveral drug delivery demonstrations using the \n“backpack” strategy have been carried out over the \npast few years [162-166]. \n \n \nFigure 8. Reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages by iron oxide nanoparticles as an anti-tumor therapeutic strategy [159]. Copyright Year 2021, the Authors. \n\nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7094 \nWyatt Shields IV et al . integrated interferon \ngamma (IFN -γ) into a “backpack”, and IFN -γ as a \npro-inflammatory macrophage stimulator can sustain \nmacrophages in a tumor-killing M1 type state. In mice \nwith cancer, the ma intenance effect slowed tumor \ngrowth and reduced metastasis for up to five days. \nSpecifically, the team fabricated two layers of the \nbiocompatible polymer poly (lactic- co-glycolic acid, \nPLGA) sandwiched with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and \nthe cytokine IFN -γ. To complete the “backpack”, a \nlayer of cellular adhesive was also added to help the \n“backpack” fit snugly on the macrophages. In \naddition, they attach easily and do not become \nphagocytosed or digested by macrophages due to \ntheir disc-shape, allowing them to survive for longer \nperiods of time. The researchers injected “backpack”  \n-carrying M1 macrophages into the tumors of mice \nand assessed them seven days later. Based on the \nfindings of the in vivo study, macrophages carrying an \nIFN-γ “backpack” exhibited M1 indicators for more \nthan 48 hours. As compared to cells injected with free \nIFN-γ  o r  c e l l s  w i t h  a  b l a n k  “ b a c k p a c k ” ,  t h e r e  w a s  a  \nsignificant difference in expression level of M1 \nindicators. Additionally, treatment with IFN -γ \n“backpack” therapy resulted in f ewer metastatic \nnodules, smaller tumors, and longer lifespans than \ncontrol group. Interestingly, not only do “backpack” \n-wearing macrophages stay in the M1 state, but it can \nalso repolarize other macrophages including TAMs \ntowards the M1 phenotype in vivo. In contrast to other \nstudies, this effect was achieved at 100 times less than \nthe maximum total dose of IFN -γ, and the mice did \nnot show any signs of treatment toxicity [167]. \nAs a result of the “backpack” strategy, macro -\nphages adoptively transferred int o solid tumors will \nretain their phenotype in an immunosuppressive \nenvironment. To improve its efficacy against solid \ntumors, future research can continue to delve into the \noptimal way of packing the stimulator into the \n“backpack” and its release kinetics.  In addition, \n“backpack” can be combined with adjunctive thera -\npies to increase the therapeutic effect. These strategies \nshould also not be restricted to macrophages and can \nalso engage other circulating cells with increased \nchemotactic sensitivity to mount a more robust tumor \nimmune response [168,169]. \n4 Semi-biological hybrid cellular \ntransformers \nAbundant chemical groups on cell membranes \nare able to create interactions with the interfaces of \nnanomaterials or carriers. Based on this, coupling \nsynthetic materials to the cell surface or encapsulating \nnano-drugs inside the cells can promote the exposure \nof tumor -associated antigens and induce tumor \nimmune responses on the one hand, on the other hand \ncan realize multimodal therapy of tumors by \ncombining PDT or PTT, and most importantly, the \nconstructed biomimetic nanocarriers have the \nproperty of actively targeting tumor sites. Such \nbiomimetic nano -drug delivery systems constructed \nor modified artificially we call them semi- biological \nhybrid cellular transform ers. By active targeting \neffect, it can reduce the non -specific distribution of \ndrugs in the body, and the safety and efficacy of \ntreatment can be improved [170]. Through \nendocytosis mediated by the interaction of surface \nconjugating ligands with membrane receptors of \ntarget cells, semi -bio hybrid cellular transformer can \nincrease the concentration of drugs inside the target \ncells [171]. A series of nanocarriers modified with \nligands, antibodies, antibody fragments or short \npeptides with high specificity and affinity have been \ndeveloped so far according to the receptors or protein \nantigens that are highly expressed specifically on the \ntumor cell membrane [172]. For example, transferrin \ncan bind to transferrin receptors on the membranes of \nmetastatic tumors a nd drug -resistant tumor cells to \nmediate endocytosis of drugs [173]. It has been shown \nthat Arginine glycine aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptides \ntarget tumor vessel and cell integrins αvβ3 that are \nupregulated on the surface of tumor cells and increase \nthe del ivery efficiency of drugs [174]. In addition to \nprotein ligands, carbohydrate ligands (e.g., \nhyaluronic acid, HA), folate receptors that are highly \nexpressed in a variety of tumor cells, and nucleic acid \naptamers can also bind receptors specific to tumor cell \nsurfaces, conjugating them onto the  nano-biomimetic \ndrug delivery system not only mediates efficient \nuptake of drugs, but also enables enhanced delivery \nefficiency and safety of nanomedicines [175,176]. \nIn addition to artificially modified ligands, \ncertain specific types of cells have been regarded as \npotential drug delivery vehicles due to their abilities \nto homing to tumors and long circulation in the blood. \nFor example, tumor cell membranes can be exploited \nfor surface functionalization of nanoparticles, thereby \nendowing them with the ability for homologous \ntargeting to achieve tumor specific drug delivery \n[177]. Engineered CCMs prepared by fusing CCMs \nwith other types of CCMs or making CCMs express \nspecific proteins provide a new direction for \novercoming the defects of CCMs and improving the \nbiomedical properties of CCMs [178]. The latest \nresearch points out that the nano- drug coated with \nglioblastoma (GBM) cell membrane has good \nblood-brain barrier ( BBB) permeability and no \nobvious side effects [179]. Besides, since a variety of \nimmune cells are recruited to the tumor site during \ncancer development, this inspired researchers to use \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7095 \nthe cell membrane coated nanomedicine of immune \ncells to obtain the dual roles of tumor targeting and \nimmunotherapy. It h as been confirmed that \nnano-biomimetic drug delivery systems based on \nmonocyte/macrophage membrane, neutrophil mem -\nbrane and immune cell membrane can improve the \ndelivery efficiency of antitumor drugs [180-183]. \nAlthough semi -biological hybrid cellular \ntransformers can also be surface modified or loaded \nwith drugs, there are some differences with EVs drug \ndelivery systems. The difference between the two is \nthat EVs, as part of the cell, only inherit some of the \ncell’s properties. In order to develop dynamic  drug \ndelivery systems using EVs, it is usually necessary to \nintroduce functional components into cells and \nrelease them in the form of EVs when the parent cells \nare exposed to specific stimuli [184]. The preparation \nprocess is complex and the yield is difficult to control. \nHowever, the direct loading of drugs into the isolated \nEVs may lead to vesicle aggregation and membrane \nprotein damage [185]. In addition, the large -scale \nextraction and purification of EVs has been a major \nproblem restricting their clin ical application [186]. In \ncontrast, semi-biological hybrid cellular transformers \nmostly use cell membranes as carriers, so the types of \nsurface proteins and markers are more abundant, and \nthere are more possibilities in preparing targeted \ncarriers. In addition, semi -biological hybrid cellular \ntransformers can be prepared by using single- cell \nbiofilms to encapsulate drugs, or by preparing hybrid \nmembranes to impart more properties to the carriers. \nThe more accessible membrane materials and higher \ncarrier yield also make it more universal than EVs in \nthe future. It is worth noting that compared with \nsynthetic NPs, drug carriers constructed by natural \ncell membranes or EVs still have incomparable \nadvantages. They can effectively load therapeutic \ndrugs without significantly changing the membrane \nstructure and surface protein, and have stability, \nbiocompatibility, extremely low immunogenicity, \ntargeting and the ability to overcome natural barriers \nin the blood circulation, which can overcome the \nlimitations of synthetic NPs [187-189]. \n4.1 Cargo loaded cellular transformers \nLoss of tumor antigen expression is one of the \nimportant mechanisms of immune escape . Tumor \ncells evade killing by the immune system by \ndownregulating the expression of strong rejection \nantigens, downregulating major histocompatibility \nantigen I (MHC -I) levels, and impairing antigen - \npresenting function [190]. Utilizing semi biological \nhybrid cellular transforms to deliver drugs \nspecifically to tumor cells, and induce specific types of \ncell death , would lead to the release of tumor \nassociated antigens (TAAs), which in turn be \nrecognized by immune cells and activate antitumor \nimmune responses [191]. \nRecently, a new form of cell death known as \nferroptosis has been discovered that could improve \nimmunogenicity of tumors. The existing agents that \ninduce tumor cells to undergo ferroptosis usually face \ntwo major problems of b eing easily cleared by the \nbody’s immune system and being difficult to target. \nJiang et al . coated sulfasalazine (SAS) -  loaded \nmagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe\n3O4 NP) with \nplatelet membrane by extrusion method to obtain \nbiomimetic nanoparticles Fe3O4- SAS@PLT with better \nstability. P-selectin on the surface of platelets works in \nconjunction with CD44 on the surface of 4T1 tumor \ncells to increase the uptake of nanoparticles and \npromote the accumulation of nanoparticles in \nmetastatic tumors. The ingested magnetic iron oxide \nand sulfas alazine synergistically induce ferroptosis, \nexpose TAAs, and activate antitumor immune \nresponses ( Figure 9 ). The rate of DC maturation \ninduced by biomimetic nanocarriers was increased to \n69.9%, which was significantly higher than that of \nnanoparticles without platelet membrane coating \n(28.4%). Programmed death (PD-1) inhibitors and this \nbiomimetic nanocarrier were combined to treat tumor \nbearing mice, achieving 76% of mice survival up to 80 \ndays, while the mice in other control groups all died \nwithin 50 day s [192]. This approach of utilizing \nnatural ligands of cell membranes to deliver drugs \nspecifically to tumor sites provides a feasible strategy \nto enhance antitumor immunity, meanwhile, the \noutstanding biocompatibility from cell membranes \nimproves the possibility of clinical translation. \nThere are many tumors stromal cells in the TME, \nincluding cancer-associated fibroblasts (AF), and this \noccupies a major position as a barrier to the \ndevelopment of cancer treatments. On the one hand, \nAF secretes many growth  factors and cytokines to \nactivate tumor related signaling pathways to promote \nangiogenesis, tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, \nand resistance generation [193]. On the other hand, \nAF prevents drug entry into tumor cells by \nsurrounding tumor cells and producing extracellular \nmatrix (ECM) [194]. It is illustrated that AF constitutes \na physical barrier to protect tumor cells and impedes \nthe access of anticancer drugs to the tumor to exert \ntheir effects. Many studies have therefore turned to \nthe treatment of tumors based on AF. Li et al. reported \nan activated AF coated semiconductor polymer \nnanoparticle (SPN) for enhanced tumor phototherapy \n[195]. This nanocomplex, called AF -SPN, is \nconstructed from a semiconductor polymer (SP) \ncontaining NIR absorption and the AF cell membrane. \nAs a theranostic agent, SP can be used for both \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7096 \nimaging and photothermal therapy by producing NIR \nfluorescence and singlet oxygen. By coating the AF \ncell membrane with NPs, homologous targeting was \nenabled, and promoting NPs accumula tion in the \nvicinity of cancer cells and thus enhancing the efficacy \nof photodiagnostic therapy. Furthermore, this \nbiomimetic nanocomposite can also be loaded with \nother drugs and imaging agents to provide a \nmultimodal theranostic platform, providing new \nideas for tumor theranostics. \n4.2 Engineered modified cellular transformers \nRecently, as a representative of adoptive cell \ntherapy, CAR-T has achieved a large breakthrough in \nthe treatment of hematological tumors. But due to the \nlimitation of many factors, such as the lack of tumor \nspecific antigen and the suppressive tumor immune \nmicroenvironment, CAR-T therapy still faces a great \nchallenge in the treatment of solid tumors [196]. In \nview of this, to improve CAR -T cell targeting and \nantitumor efficacy, we must start with optimization of \nCAR-T target selection, reduction of antigen escape \nand breaking immunosuppression in the TME [197]. \nOwing to the high mutability of tumor cells and the \nchanging immune microenvironment, the pheno-\nmenon of tumor immune escape is difficult to \neliminate, and the dual targeting strategy can provide \na more reliable and effective way for nanocarriers to \ntarget tumors. Researchers have used bioorthogonal \ntechnology to construct artificial targets BCN groups \n(bicyclic [6.1.0] nonyne) at the tumor site. Meanwhile, \nazide groups (N\n3) were embedded into T cell \n \n \nFigure 9.

A special \nprotein (T -cell antigen receptor, TCR) on the T -cell \nmembrane endowed N3⁃TINPs with immune \nrecognition ability to tumor cells, while functionalized \nN\n3 groups enabled efficient and specific \nbioorthogonal reaction with BCN groups of artificial \ntargets for glycometabolic labeling on tumor cells \n(Figure 10). N3⁃TINPs greatly enhance the enrichment \nof ICG at the tumor site to effectively overcome the \ntumor “ off target effect”, thus improving the \nantitumor efficacy of nanocarriers based on their \ntumor targeting with immunomodulatory drugs \nusing artificial targeting and natural target based dual \nguide therapy [198]. \nIn recent years, aptamers as novel targeting \nligands can also modulate the body ’s antitumor \nimmune response by binding immune related \nreceptors, which could be applied to tumor \nimmunotherapy. In 2019, an osteosclerotic protein \naptamer drug developed by the research team of \nHong Kong Baptist University has been grante d \norphan drug certification by FDA for the treatment of \nosteogenesis imperfecta [199]. Previous studies have \nshown that aptamers can be directly used in tumor \nimmunotherapy as novel targeting ligands for tumor \nassociated antigens, immune checkpoint molecul es, \ncostimulatory receptors, cytokines, and can also be \ncoupled with drugs, siRNA, nanomaterials [200 -202]. \nOr modify the aptamer on the cell membrane surface \nto exert anti -tumor effect [203]. The interaction \nbetween immune and tumor cells is an important link \nto achieve highly effective immunotherapy. By \nrecognizing tumor cells on the surface of immune cell \nmembranes, anchoring nucleic acid aptamers can \ndirectly induce the immune cells to attack the tumor \ncells and maximize the therapeutic effect. For \nexample, the aptamer S4F targeting SGC -7901 gastric \ncancer cells were modified on the surface of CD3\n+T \ncells by metabolic labeling and click chemistry, giving \nthem stronger tumor targeting and killing [204]. NK \ncells modified with TLS11a aptamer and programmed \ncell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) aptamer can both target \nattacking liver cancer cells and resist the inhibition of \nPD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint, enhancing the \n \n \nFigure 10. Schematic illustration of N3-labeled T cell membrane-biomimetic nanoparticles with dual-targeting mechanism for highly efficient photothermal therapy. Adapted \nwith permission from [198].

Recently, researchers used DNA \naptamers as a substitute for antibodies to construct a \npolyvalent antibody mimic (PAM), which utilizes \nhydrophobic insertion to insert the PAM into the cell \nmembrane of NK cells to make NK cells identify and \ncapture the corresponding tumor cells effectively. \nThis method has a broad spectrum, and any aptamer \nof interest can be modified on various immune cells \n[206]. Compared with CAR- T/NK immunotherapy, \nwhich has a large therapeutic risk and complicated \noperation, the aptamer modified immune cells are \nmore easily av ailable and have less toxic and side \neffects, making them highly potential for clinical \napplications. \nSince tumor surface markers are different, the \nselection of suitable cell membrane surface modifiers \nis crucial for the targeting of biomimetic nanocarriers. \nLow density lipoprotein receptor related protein \n(LRP) receptors are overexpressed in endothelial cells \nof the BBB and in U87MG GBM cells. Based on this \nproperty, Shi et al.  constructed an angiopep -2 \nmodified biomimetic nanocarrier of RBCs membrane \nloaded with polymer coloaded DOX and lexiscan \n(Lex). Lex can transiently open the BBB and increase \nthe permeability of the nanomedicine to the brain, \nwhile angiopep-2 can target the highly expressed LRP \nin the GBM, promoting the passage of the \nnanomedicine through BBB and achieving GBM \ntargeting while prolonging the circulation time of the \nNPs [207]. After further research, Shi et al. constructed \nApoE peptide modified RBCs  membrane \nencapsulated temozolomide (TMZ) and the epigenetic \nbromodomain inhibitor (OTX015) biomimetic \nnanocarriers to achieve synergistic chemotherapy and \nimmune therapy for GL261 GBM. In contrast to \nprevious studies, ApoE peptides can target multiple \noverexpressed low -density lipoprotein family \nreceptors (LDLRs) (e.g., LDLR, LRP 1, and LRP2) in \nBBB endothelial cells and GBM cells, thus providing \nsuperior BBB penetration and tumor targeting \ncapabilities [208]. This biomimetic nanocarrier \nenhances the sensitivity of TMZ to tumor cells while \ntargeting GBM. The anti-tumor immune response was \nalso enhanced by enhanced expression of CD4\n + and \nCD8 + T cells through induction of immunogenic cell \ndeath and suppression of PD-1/PD-L1 coupling [209]. \nCompared with brain tumors, digestive system \ntumors exist in a large variety and complex \ncharacteristics of biomarkers . Therefore, finding \nsuitable targets is particularly important for the \ntargeting, efficacy and safety of biomimetic \nnanocarriers. \n4.3 Engineered cellular bioreactors \nCurrently, although surgery, chemotherapy, and \nradiotherapy are all effective methods of suppressing \nprimary tumors, nearly 90% of cancer -related deaths \nare still caused by cancer cell metastasis [210]. To \nimprove cancer treatment outcomes, it may be \nbeneficial to modulate the TME rather than directly \ndestroy cancer cells [211]. Studies have confirmed that \nthe immunosuppressive TME of solid tumors is \ncharacterized by severe hypoxia, elevated H\n2O2 \ncontent, and overexpression of glutathione, while a \ncascade bioreactor constructed by combining natural \ncell membranes with na nomedicines is able to \nmodulate the tumor microenvironment, improve \nradiotherapy, and support immunotherapy. \nLiu et al . used Ti ₃C₂ nanosheets as carriers to \nchemically conjugated with glucose oxidase (GOX) \nand chloroperoxidase (CPO) and load deoxygenation- \nactivated prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) to prepare a \ncascaded-enzyme nanoreactor Ti ₃C₂- GOX - CPO / \nTPZ (TGCT), which was finally encapsulated into \ntumor cell membrane carriers with high expression of \nCD47 (mₑTGCT). Because the encapsulation of highly \nexpressed CD47 biomimetic membrane, m ₑTGCT \nexhibits superior immune escape ability as well as \nhomologous targeting ability, which can be \npreferentially targeted to tumor sites and effectively \nenhanced tumor cell uptake. After entering tumor \ncells, GOX and CPO ca n produce a large amount of \nHClO through a cascade reaction, achieving highly \nefficient enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT). In addition, \nA further laser irradiation can increase singlet oxygen \n(¹O₂) production by accelerating enzyme catalyzed \nreactions. Meanwhil e, the oxygen consumption of \nphototherapy and EDT could aggravate the hypoxic \nstate inside the tumor, and then activate the \ndeoxygenation-activated prodrug TPZ to realize \nchemotherapy. Experimental results showed that \nmₑTGCT can effectively inhibit tumor growth because \nof the amplified synergistic therapeutic effect of \ntumor phototherapy, enzyme  dynamic therapy, and \nchemotherapy ( Figure 11 ). A cascaded enzyme \nnanoreactor proves to be a promising way of \nachieving synchronized and remarkable antitumor \ntherapy [212]. At present, bacteria based synthetic \nbiology has also been widely used in tumor therapy \nand achieved good results. Zhang et al . created a \nbacterium, Escherichia coli  (MG1655), that \noverexpresses the NDH -2 enzyme (respiratory chain  \nenzyme II) and colonizes tumors and increase the \ngeneration of H\n2O2. Subsequently, the experiments \ncovalently linked magnetic Fe 3O4 nanoparticles with \nbacteria and acted as a catalyst for Fenton -like \nreaction to transform H2O2 into toxic hydroxyl radical \n(•OH) for tumor therapy. The structures proved that \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7099 \nthe constructed bioreactor sustainably produced H2O2 \nwith engineered bacteria for performing Fenton -like \nreaction, while the generated toxic •OH could \neffectively induce tumor  cell apoptosis. With this \nbioreactor, it is possible to achieve aggressive tumor \ncolonization as well as self -sufficient Fenton- like \nreactions without the need for additional H2O2 [213]. \nConclusions and future perspectives \nWorldwide, digestive system cancer is still the \nleading cause of cancer death. Digestive sy stem \ncancer is still the most common cause of cancer death \nworldwide. The clinical treatments for digestive \nsystem tumors are still conventional surgery, \nchemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgical treatment, \nwhich is more effective for early -stage tumors that \nhave not spread, but with the development and \nmetastasis of malignant tumors, the curative effect \nand prognosis of advanced tumors are poor, and often \ncannot completely clear all cancer cells in the human \nbody. Although chemotherapy can play a certain role, \ndue to its lack of specificity, there is a large damage to \nthe normal cells and immune system of the body, and \nit is easy to increase the body’ s drug resistance and \ncause adverse reactions. Radiotherapy has the \nproblem of long cycle length and significant toxic side \neffects to human body. Some novel therapies such as \nimmune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted agents, and \nCAR-T have played an important role in the treatment \nof digestive system cancer, but they also suffer from \ndefects such as drug resistance and severe adverse \neffects. Under this background, the new idea of \nbiomimetic nano- drug delivery system based on \nnatural cells may change the situation of d igestive \nsystem malignant tumor treatment ( Table 2). The \npromotion effects of biomimetic nano -drug delivery \nsystems for digestive system tumor therapy are \nmainly reflected in the following aspects. 1) The \noptimal multi -drug co -delivery system can be \ndesigned according to the inherent characteristics of \nvarious cell membranes, and the mixing ratio of cell \nmembrane and nanoparticles can be adjusted to \noptimize the fusion process and achieve higher \nencapsulation efficiency and good controlled release \ncapability. 2) Precise modification of nanocarriers can \nbe achieved by recognition, removal or addition \nmanipulation of specific antigenic proteins on the cell \nmembrane surface to improve the tumor targeting \nability. 3) By modifying nanocarriers with hybrid \nmembranes, or incorporating ligands consisting of \nantibodies, nucleic acids or enzymes into the cell \nmembrane for surface functionalization, a variety of \n \n \nFigure 11.

However, it should be noted that drug \ncarriers targeting digestive system tumors still need to \nsolve the problems such as short internal circulation \ntime, off -target effect caused by being captured and \ncleared by immune system. In view of the low \nimmunogenicity and high heterogeneity of digestive \nsystem tumors, the inherent targeting ability of \nimmune cell membrane and the homologous \ntargeting of tumor cell membrane can be used to \nachieve targeted drug release when designing natural \ncells based biomimetic cellular transformers. \nCompared with hematological tumors, the TME of the \ndigestive system is relatively stable, and the \ninfiltrating tumor associated macrophages are highly \nheterogeneous and plastic. Therefore, targeting the \nTME can relieve the immunosuppression of the tumor \nsite, and transforming “cold tumors” into “hot \ntumors”. This is an effective strategy for designing \nbiomimetic cellular transformers as well. Our review  \nfocuses on the dynamic properti es of native cells and \nreviews their transformation characteristics. Targeting \ndigestive system tumors by transferring specific \nfunctional and biological properties of native cells \n(such as dynamic deformation, phenotypic \npolarization, enhanced immunogenic ity, immune \nescape, tumor -specific targeting) into nanocarriers \ntreatment offers a wider range of possibilities. \nNonetheless, research on natural cell -based \nbiomimetic nanoparticle drug delivery platforms in \nthe diagnosis and treatment of digestive system \ntumors is still in its infancy, and many challenges \nneed to be overcome for the transition from \nexperimental research to clinical applications. One of \nthe most important points is how to guarantee the \nsafety of biomimetic NPs. Current production \ntechnologies of biomimetic NPs are not mature \nenough, and the resulting complex and varied \nproduction processes, inconsistent standards and \npoor reproducibility will affect the efficacy and safety \nof the final products; Second, existing characterization \nmethods are limited, and the success of membrane \ncoating is verified only by particle size detection and \nmorphological observation. Western blot analysis can \nonly demonstrate whether the surface composition of \nbiomimetic nanocarriers is similar to that of the source \ncell membrane, but cannot verify whether the \nmembrane is partially disrupted after membrane \ncoating and whether biochemical reactions occur \nduring the coating process or introduce unknown \ncomponents that pose a hidden danger to drug safety. \nMoreover, biomimetic NPs with improper storage are \nprone to denaturation of membrane proteins, \nresulting in potential immune responses to \nendogenous antigens, which in turn cause tissue \ndamage to the body. Additionally, its safety issue \nshould be well considered when usin g certain special \ncell membranes such as tumor cell membrane or \nbacterial membrane. Inappropriate immunogenic \nexposure may induce detrimental immune responses, \neven against normal cell types, and long -term safety \nshould be considered. Overall, to further i mprove the \nsafety and efficacy of biomimetic NPs, the problem of \npoor reproducibility and inconsistent standards in the \npreparation process should first be addressed. \nBesides, innovative methods and infrastructure for \nnatural cell acquisition require optim ization, along \nwith high-quality storage of natural cells and efficient \ncharacterization methods. During the production \npreparation process, it is imperative for the surface \nmarkers and specific functions of natural cells to not \nbe destroyed. Yet, this rem ains an urgent problem in \nthe current natural cell biomimetic nanoparticle drug \ndelivery system towards clinical application. In \naddition, the tumor permeability, systemic \ncumulative toxicity, self -degradability and body \nexcretion pathway after targeting b iomimetic \nnanoparticle drug delivery to the tumor site still need \nto be explored. \nThe ultimate goal of discovering and developing \nbiomimetic nano-drug delivery system is to reach the \nclinical stage and achieve large -scale industrial \nproduction. Most of the  studies on the drug -loaded \nbiomimetic NPs are still in the preclinical stage. Some  \nformulations have undergone clinical research and \nmay be used to serve patients soon ( Table 3). In \nconclusion, despite the great success of natural cell \nbiomimetic nanoparticle drug delivery for treating \ntumors, this innovative strategy still stays at the \nlaboratory stage and cannot meet the requirements for \nclinical applications because there are currently no \nsuitable methods to ensure the controllability of the \npreparation process and the safety and efficacy of the \nuse process. However, challenges always coexist with \nopportunities. From the laboratory to the clinic, there \nare still many issues that must be addressed urgently. \nTheranostics 2022, Vol. 12, Issue 16 \n \n \nhttps://www.thno.org \n7101 \nBut the unique advantages and application potent ial \nof the natural cell biomimetic nanoparticle drug \ndelivery system are still undeniable, which provides \nthe design and application of nano- drugs. The new \nthinking mode will have a place in the field of \nprecision medicine. \n \nTable 2.
