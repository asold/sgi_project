    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. However, their performance in domain-specific contexts, such as E-learning, is hindered by the lack of specific domain knowledge. This paper adopts a novel approach of retrieval augment generation to empower LLMs with domain-specific knowledge in the field of E-learning. The approach leverages external knowledge sources, such as E-learning lectures or research papers, to enhance the LLM’s understanding and generation capabilities. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to existing methods in capturing and generating E-learning-specific information.",
