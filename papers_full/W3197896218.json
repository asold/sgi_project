However, handling\ncross-camera identification in complex occlusion scenes still faces\ngreat challenges. In the conventional person Re-Id task, the aligned\nperson image usually contains the information of the holistic body\n[37, 47]. Previous works [4, 32, 33, 41] tend to build strong back-\nbone features or add part correlations, thereby the robust global\nfeature expressions of the person can be learned. By contrast, in the\nocclusion scene, there usually exists a large number of occluding\nobjects in aligned person images [52], which makes it difficult to\nproduce reliable and discernible features.\nBy taking a deep investigation into the occluded person Re-Id\ntask, the redundant occlusion does not only lead to the loss of target\ninformation but also introduces additional disturbing information.\nThese occlusions of different characters such as color, size, shape,\nand structural position have affected the overall re-identification\n∗Jia Li is the corresponding author (E-mail: jiali@buaa.edu.cn).\nWebsite: https://cvteam.net/.\nFigure 1: The motivation of our proposed method. We esti-\nmate the keypoints of the pedestrian in image and extract\nlocal information with limited region. Then we aggregate in-\nformation in more abstract part region according to the po-\nsition of each keypoint. We capture the most representative\ninformation and match it with its corresponding semantic\ninformation to get the final retrieval results.\nof the person. Most of the existing methods adopt the pose esti-\nmation [9, 21, 35], the mask guidance [15], or the class activations\n[13, 16, 18, 29, 31, 44] as auxiliary guidance to amplify the discrimi-\nnative regions with higher confidence. Mask-guided information\n[16] helps discover the foreground region but loses the internal\nrelation of keypoints which is provided by the pose estimation like\n[35].\nTo solve this problem, pose-guided person Re-Id models [9, 21,\n35] adopt an auxiliary keypoint detector to detect visible body parts,\nsuch as heads, hands, and legs, which build the strong semantic\nrepresentation of the object. In the occluded scenarios, the overlap\nof other agnostic objects usually leads to the disturbance of the\nright location of body parts. Hence directly matching these regions\nwould produce severe errors in the retrieval phase. To this end, most\nof the existing methods [ 9, 21, 35] adopt local feature matching,\nsuch as feature alignment and graph matching.\nWang et al. [35] propose a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)\nbased method to generate part features using pose guided key-\npoints and they apply graph matching to align these part features.\nHowever, some keypoints extracted from the image cover the back-\nground and occlusion or they have limited area. Miao et al. [21]\npropose a partial and pose-guided part feature alignment to select\nthe useful information from the heavily occluded person. But the\nsemantic information of different partial features is not always the\nsame, and it neglects the relationship between these partial features.\nDespite their performance differences, current occluded person\nRe-Id methods still show limitations in three aspects: 1) the pose\narXiv:2109.03483v1  [cs.CV]  8 Sep 2021\nestimation network generates unreliable localization, further fea-\nture matching with these parts is easily lead to misalignment; 2)\nthe generation of local part regions usually neglects essential con-\ntextual information, leads to overfitting issues on visual patterns; 3)\nthe structural relationship of keypoints structures is not deeply in-\nvestigated, which makes it difficult to recognize some unreasonable\nmatching results.\nTo solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a pose-guided\ninter- and intra-part relational transformer for the occluded person\nRe-Id task. For constructing reliable part features, we firstly expand\nthe keypoint regions into larger masks and then merge the keypoint\nparts into several groups (3 groups for illustration in Fig. 1). Thus\nfurther feature representation learning is conducted within each\ngroup to form a stable feature. Moreover, we aggregate the key-\npoint heatmaps to form a holistic object to enhance the foreground\nsemantic regions for identification.\nAfter exerting pose-based information from an external pre-\ntrained model, we propose a joint part compositional model of three\ntypes of parts, encoding the contextual regions while strengthening\nthe local features. We adopt the striped slice, patched grid, and\npose-keypoint region as part representations of the image as shown\nin Fig. 2. After introducing contextual information and building\nstrong part representations, we propose our relational transformer\nto construct structural understanding. We adopt the successfully\npracticed transformer architecture in the field of natural language\nprocessing. With part parsing, each part feature is regarded as one\ngraph node to adaptively learn the robust representation, which\nhandles the missing semantics with the occlusion. In Fig. 1, within\neach part group, every regularized keypoint region is aggregated\ninto the holistic representation for this group. During the retrieval\nprocess, we search the nearest neighbor of the query image using\nglobal features and part-based local features. With the collaborative\nconstraints of local features and global features, our proposed Pirt\nmodel achieves a new state of the art on the public occluded per-\nson Re-Id dataset, Occluded-Duke dataset [21] with the supervised\nsetting. We also conduct detailed ablations to verify the effective-\nness of the proposed pose guidance strategies and the inter- and\nintra-part relational architecture. Further extensions on standard\nnon-occluded person Re-Id datasets also reveal the comparable\ngeneralization capability of our model.\nOur contribution can be summarized as three-fold:\n(1) We propose a pose-guided inter- and intra-part relational\ntransformer for occluded person re-identification, which\nbuilds long-term correlations by introducing transformer\narchitectures. Experimental results also verify our proposed\nmethod reaches a new state of the art on public benchmarks.\n(2) We make insightful improvements for pose-guided feature\nextractions, in which detected keypoints are expanded to\nconstruct the holistic object while forming part groups.\n(3) We propose to learn the intra-part relationship with self-\ncorrelations and construct a multi-source inter-part rela-\ntionship learning with relational transformers, providing a\nstructural understanding of different part components.\n2 RELATED WORK\nPerson re-identification. Great improvements have been made in\nsupervised Person Re-Id [39]. One solution to handle the challenge\nis the part-based model, which was proposed according to the fixed\nposition of one person in the image [32, 43]. Sun et al. [32] proposed\na uniform partitioning strategy to output the visual descriptor con-\nsisting of several horizontal part-level features, similar ideas can\nbe founded in other fine-grained tasks [11, 46]. On the other hand,\nto enhance the person feature representation capability of Con-\nvolutional Neural Network (CNN), several methods [4, 17, 24, 50]\ntried to extend modules to get better performance. Hou et al. [17]\nproposed a spatial interaction-and-aggregation module to capture\nrelationships between spatial features. Attention mechanism was\nused for designing CNNs to capture person information in images\n[2, 33, 38, 41, 45]. Zhang et al. [41] utilized the clustering-like infor-\nmation among spatial positions in the feature map and proposed\ntwo relation-aware global attention modules. In some mask-guided\nmodels [3, 27], external knowledge helps to capture the informa-\ntion of the foreground. In some pose-guided models [10, 28], the\npositional and semantic information of the keypoints were used to\nproduce local features and explore the connection between them.\nOccluded person re-identification. Recognizing an occluded\nperson is much difficult because of the confusing information and\nspatial feature misalignment [35]. Most of the papers adopt the local\nfeature matching method [ 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 29, 31, 35, 44, 51].\nHe et al. [13] proposed a method of spatial feature reconstruction\nthat got robust local feature maps, then the author used the least\nsquare algorithm to solve the coefficient matrix to align correspond-\ning spatial features. Heet al. [16] proposed a method that was based\non the inspiration of [13]. The paper [16] proposed a method aim-\ning to extract probability scores from the foreground probability\nnetwork. The scores are used for the spatial reconstruction by as-\nsigning the body parts with confidence scores. Wang et al. [35]\nproposed a keypoint semantic feature extraction method with pose\nguidance, then feature maps were passing messages using GNN.\nIn addition, the method in the paper[21] used the basic idea of the\npaper [32] with pose estimation methods to generate robust fea-\ntures, while [15] used pose estimation and salience object detection\nsimultaneously, which generated the semantic mask constrained\nby two keypoint detectors of the human body.\nImage retrieval. The local feature matching used in the oc-\ncluded person Re-Id is similar to the local feature matching used\nin image retrieval [ 1, 6, 19, 26, 36, 40]. Keypoints across images\nmust comply some certain physical constraints. For example, one\nkeypoint is associated with a certain keypoint in another image and\nsome keypoints are mismatched due to occlusion. Sarlin et al. [26]\nproposed an attention-based graph neural network to jointly find\ncorresponding keypoints and reject irrelevant keypoints. The paper\n[26] combined with traditional local feature detector and descrip-\ntor which extract sparse keypoints. Cao et al. [1] introduced an\nauto-encoder-based dimensionality reduction technique for local\nfeatures and combined the global feature with local features to\nget better performances. The local features were generated from\nCNN in the paper [1], which were a sort of high-level information\nextracted from the original image. Our method also draws some\ninspiration from the paper [1].\nFigure 2: The overall architecture of our proposed model, which consists of three essential parts: feature extraction from\nthe image, keypoints generation from the image, inter- and intra-part relational transformer to aggregate the information\nbetween different visible or invisible regions.\nTransformer. The transformer was firstly proposed by [34] for\nmachine translation. Similar and improved methods reached the\nstate of the art in many natural language processing tasks. One\nof the representative works [7] is a solid example to explain the\nstrength of self-attention. With the development of the transformer,\na lot of works [23, 42] were looking at how to design the transformer\nfor image recognition. [42] explored several self-attention modules\nwhich were invariant to permutation, then they proposed a patch-\nwise self-attention module with the capacity to uniquely identify\nspecific locations.\n3 METHOD\n3.1 Overview\nThe difficulties of occluded person Re-Id lie in the incomplete in-\nformation and the unstable location of the person in the image. In\nmost cases, a pedestrian in the surveillance scenario has a stand-\ning or walking posture with his head, body, and legs well aligned\nfrom the top to bottom. An intricate occlusion environment would\ncause more negative effects, especially on locality. We use a pose\nestimation network Pto extract keypoints of the person in the\nimage I∈[ 0,255]𝐻×𝑊×3. The keypoints cover the correspond-\ning positions of human body joints in the image and keypoints\nare represented by heatmaps M ∈(0,1)𝐻𝑚×𝑊𝑚×𝑃, where 𝑃 is the\nnumber of keypoints. Besides, we use a Global Max Pooling (GMP)\nlayer to expand the original limited coverage of keypoints to seize\nmore essential contextual information. We extract the visible part\ninformation of the pedestrian through these heatmaps M.\nAfter the essential local part information is obtained, we merge\nall the heatmaps M into one human mask C ∈( 0,1)𝐻𝑓×𝑊𝑓 . We\ncombine human mask C together with the corresponding spatial\nfeature map F ∈R𝐻𝑓×𝑊𝑓×𝐶 generated by the backbone. F is passed\ninto the Intra-part Relational Module (IRM) which is one of the\ncomponents of our model. The feature mapsF𝑖𝑟𝑚 generated by IRM\nare partitioned by different strategies into three-part feature sets\nas shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. For each feature in each set, we use a\nGlobal Average Pooling (GAP) layer to mix the information of the\npartitioned area. We denote F𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 ∈R𝑁×𝐶 as our local features\nand 𝑁 is the number of parts. In addition, all the keypoint parts are\ndivided into three groups. We totally have three groups of keypoints\nthat are represented by heatmaps: one group of head keypoints,\none group of upper body keypoints, and the last one of lower body\nkeypoints.\nFinally, each type of local featuresF𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 is sent into the Inter-part\nRelational Transform (IRT) to generate well representative features\nas the final embedding features. Embedding features partitioned\nby the M are received by Confidence Score Module (CSM). The\noutputs are incorporated with max score S from M to produce final\nembedding features.\n3.2 Pose-guided Feature Extraction\nPerson Re-Id is a branch of fine-grained task, therefore severe oc-\nclusion and multiple pedestrians in the image seriously impair the\ninformation of the target person. It is difficult for general models to\nlearn the knowledge from the datasets and to reliably positioning\nthe person in the image. To overcome the problems described above,\npose information is critical to find keypoints that represent visible\nparts of the pedestrian.\nWe firstly usePto generate keypoints and their original heatmaps.\nFor each heatmap, the value in each grid ranged from 0 to 1 repre-\nsents the corresponding confidence score. Each initial pose heatmap\nonly covers a limited region. Because the domain gap between the\ndataset trained for Pand the dataset trained for Re-ID task is large.\nWe use a GMP layer to expand the area and integrate more contex-\ntual information:\nM = 𝐺𝑀𝑃(ˆM), (1)\nwhere ˆM is initial heatmaps generated by P. After gathering all\nheatmaps M containing extra peripheral information, we choose\nthe maximum confidence score S for all heatmaps on the identical\ngrid to construct the human mask C:\nC𝑔 = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(M𝑔), (2)\nwhere 𝑔represents the 𝑔th grid in original heatmaps. We use local\nfeatures as complementary information to get better performances.\nFor each local feature generated by each keypoint, we set a threshold\n𝜏to convert the original heatmapsM into 0-1 masks. Then we apply\na GAP layer to generate features:\nF𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒 = 𝐺𝐴𝑃((M > 𝜏)· F𝑖𝑟𝑚), (3)\nwhere F𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒 is one type of F𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 in Sect. 3.4. We select the max\nconfidence score in each grouped heatmaps M for subsequent fu-\nsion.\n3.3 Intra-part Relational Module\nWith the guidance of pose information, learning methods for local\npart features from an image still have a large development space.\nBased on the mentioned traits of the image, we assume that each\nhorizontal area probably contains part information of the pedestrian.\nAfter we obtain the spatial features F generated by the backbone,\nwe design a bottleneck-like style module called intra-part relational\nmodule. For each horizontal part of F, our goal is to find the re-\nlationship between features in it. Our overall architecture of IRM\nis shown in Fig. 3. We split our architecture into three stages. At\nthe first stage, we use a convolutional layer with 1 ×1 filters to\nencode the channel information. InstanceNorm layer, BatchNorm\n(BN) layer and the activation function ReLU to construct a block\n𝜙(·), and for features F:\nF𝜙 = 𝜙(F), (4)\nwhere F𝜙 ∈R𝐻𝑓×𝑊𝑓×𝑑 indicates the intermediate features gener-\nated by 𝜙(·), and 𝑑is their dimension. To capture visible pedestrian\ninformation of each part, an attention mechanism called Multi-Head\nSelf-Attention (MHSA) [34] is used to find the relation between\nfeatures in the horizontal part. This module is used in a standard\ntransformer block as well. We then horizontally divide F𝜙 into\nstriped features eF𝜙 ∈R1×𝑊𝑓×𝑑 as shown in Fig. 3. The striped fea-\nture eF𝜙 contains multiple individual features with dimension𝑑. We\nuse MHSA to build relationships between these features, then the\nrelational guidance is built to construct different attention scores\nfor each feature eF𝜙. We place all features into original position. To\navoid the over-fitting problem that might be raised by MHSA, we\nFigure 3: Brief illustration of our intra-part relational mod-\nule and transform unit. a) is our proposed intra-part rela-\ntional module and b) is the general component of our inter-\npart relational transformer.\nadopt a Dropout layer to be a stochastic identical mapping:\nF∗\n𝜙 = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝑀𝐻𝑆𝐴(𝑐ℎ𝑢𝑛𝑘(F𝜙)))+ 𝐷𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡 (F𝜙). (5)\nWe apply BN and ReLU to generate final features F∗\n𝜙 of stage 2.\nMHSA aggregates and captures important messages between fea-\ntures. The input consists of query features and key features of di-\nmension 𝑑𝑘, and value features of dimension 𝑑𝑣. For self-attention,\nquery features, key features, and value features are identical. We\ncompute the relation matrix as same as [34].\n𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑖(X)= 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 (XW𝑖𝑄(XW𝑖𝐾)𝑇\n√︁\n𝑑𝑘\n)XW𝑖𝑉, (6)\nX = 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑖(X))W𝐻 𝑖 ∈1,...,ℎ, (7)\nwhere X indicates abstract input features, and X indicates output\nfeatures, and W𝑄,𝐾,𝑉 represent learnable weights of query, key,\nvalue features, and their projections. At last, we use W𝐻 to en-\nhance the features of one head. Applying multiple heads can get\nmore relationships because of the diverse projections, and richer\nexpressiveness of features through MHSA is then obtained. The\nnext procedure of the final generated features F𝑖𝑟𝑚 is similar to\nfunction 𝜙(·). 𝜃(·)contains a convolutional layer and BN layer to\nrestore original dimension as input features F. Instead of applying\nthe input features F as residual connection, we combine these fea-\ntures with human mask C as an auxiliary attention complement.\nFinally, F𝑖𝑟𝑚 is produced by the following equation:\nF𝑖𝑟𝑚 = 𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(𝜃(F∗\n𝜙)+C ·F). (8)\n3.4 Inter-part Relational Transformer\nIn complex and extreme occlusion scenes, e.g., few regions of the\npedestrian are visible because of the huge size of occlusion or an-\nother person in the image, the pose estimation network Pwould\ngenerate heatmaps M that contain error locations with strong con-\nfidence scores. The different orientations of the body also influence\nthe matching results. When optimizing local features generated by\nour model through the dataset, the above problems often lead to\nsome fatal errors and an unstable training procedure.\nTherefore, we intend to aggregate local part features extracted\nby pose estimation network Pwith the global feature of the whole\nimage to train the model. The main challenge of generating global\nfeatures is obliging the model to focus on visible parts of the pedes-\ntrian as much as possible, while the information of the occlusions\noccupies a small proportion in features. In the IRM model, for any\nhorizontal region, we have paid attention to visible parts of the\npedestrian, but a solitary part hardly represents the whole pedes-\ntrian. The relation between visible parts becomes one essential\nfactor for representing the pedestrian. By constructing the relation-\nship between the different parts, we can pass messages to each part\nwhich is abstracted as a graph node. The relationship provides a\nstructural understanding between these nodes, and useless features\nlike occlusion features are discarded.\nFor tackling these problems, we introduce the inter-part rela-\ntional transformer [34]. In the field of natural language processing,\nthe transformer takes sentences or words in some scenes as the\ninput. We could build the internal relationship of various words\nfrom the global perspective. But in computer vision, the formation\nof image data is not constructed in a sequence style. In our pro-\nposed inter-part relational transformer, we incorporate transformer\nencoder architecture into our model. In each partitioning strategy,\nspatial features F𝑖𝑟𝑚 are used to generated different part features.\nDifferent partitioned abstract features X in each group are sent into\na weight-sharing transformer unit as shown in Fig. 3 to capture the\nrelationship between them. For the representation of a query part\n𝑞, some value of the feature X is related to the key part 𝑘:\n𝛼𝑞,𝑘 = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 (XW𝑖𝑄(XW𝑖𝐾)𝑇\n√𝑐 ), (9)\nwhere the attention score 𝛼𝑞,𝑘 is based on similarities over the\nquery and key part features.𝑐denotes the dimension of the abstract\nfeature X. We can obtain the attention-based features by using a\nlearnable weight W𝑅 and use multiple projections to generate final\nfeatures:\nX = 𝐹𝐹𝑁 (𝛼𝑞,𝑘XW𝑅), (10)\nwhere FFN denotes the linear projection on the X called Feed For-\nward Network. This module consists of two linear projections with\nthe ReLU activation function and the Dropout function:\n𝐹𝐹𝑁 (X)= 𝐷𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑡 (𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(XW1 +b1))W2 +b2. (11)\nIn this module, partitioned featuresX are firstly calculating relation\nthrough MHSA module, and output features are then combined\nwith residual features and the layer normalization. The subsequent\nFFN module would process these features as the same.\nPartitioning strategy. Based on the intra-part relation mod-\nule, there are three strategies for partitioning as shown in Fig. 4.\nWe firstly apply the stripe pooling which is closely related to the\nregional pooling to split features F𝑖𝑟𝑚 horizontally. We assume fea-\ntures F𝑖𝑟𝑚 of each part have already focused on the visible location\nof the pedestrian, and information of each part still well remains.\nWe mark the striped features as F𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑒 ∈R𝐻𝑓×1×𝐶.\nFigure 4: Different partitioning strategies and the procedure\nof relation building. Part features learn the self-correlation\nthrough intra-part relational module and understand the\nstructural information in each group through inter-part re-\nlational transformer.\nThe second partitioning strategy divides the spatial featuresF𝑖𝑟𝑚\ninto patched girds. We assume that the solitary utilization of intra-\npart relation module and horizontal partitioning strategy loses some\ninformation that is incorrectly ignored, resulting in the inability to\nunderlie the thorough relation between their potential information.\nIn the divided part, we aim to find the hidden spatial features and\ntheir relation, as a supplement for the global feature. We adopt a\nGMP layer to select features from F𝑖𝑟𝑚 without influencing their\npotential capability on representation. We mark patched features\nas F𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ ∈R\n𝐻𝑓\n4 ×\n𝑊𝑓\n2 ×𝐶.\nFor the last partitioning strategy, we incorporate pose heatmaps\nM with features F𝑖𝑟𝑚 to select the corresponding part feature as\nshown in Fig. 4. In addition, we divide all features generated by\nthis strategy into three disjoint groups. We denote the pose-guided\nfeatures in one of the groups as F𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒 ∈R𝑀×𝐶, where 𝑀 indicates\nthe number of manually divided features.\nWe apply our inter-part relation transformer to build long-term\nrelationships between partitioned areas. To build relations crossing\nthe part features, we individually send features into our transformer.\nFor each set of local features F𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 ∈{F𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑒 ,F𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ,F𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒}as\nmentioned in Sect. 3.2, we average the first two local features and\nregard these features as final embedding features f𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙:\nf𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 = 𝐺𝐴𝑃(𝐼𝑅𝑇(F𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙)). (12)\nBecause the pose estimation network Pis unstable for confidence\nscore generation due to the domain gap, we propose a confidence\nscore module to generate self-scores S𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓 and combine with the\nscores S mentioned in Sect. 3.2. The CSM is consistent with a Multi-\nLayer Perceptron layer, and the S𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓 is generated as the following:\nS𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓 = 𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈(ˆF𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒W1 +b1)W2 +b2, (13)\nwhere ˆF𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒 denotes three combined pose-guided features f𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒.\nWe use the ReLU activation function to build a non-linear mapping\nfunction. S𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓 is multiplied by S and a normalization function is\napplied to smooth the value. The eF𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒 is combined with the score\nat last:\neF𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒 = ˆF𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒 ·𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚(S𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓 ·S). (14)\nMatching strategy. Image retrieval task usually adopts global\nfeatures and local features to do matching like [ 19]. Due to the\nhuge differences between categories, robust local features could\nwell complete traditional retrieval tasks. Different from the image\nretrieval task, many person re-identification methods use one single\nglobal feature with dimension𝑑to represent the person in the image.\nThe main reason is that the discrepancy between local features is\nnot huge, and contributing to insufficient fine-grained details of\ntraditional local features. Therefore the results of matching only\nbased on local features are relatively poor.\nOn the other hand, occluded person Re-Id often requires local fea-\ntures for precise feature alignment to get better results. Therefore,\nseveral methods are proposed to handle this problem. [16] and [13]\nused spatial feature reconstruction and [35] directly used keypoints\nfeatures. We choose pose-guided local features which contain the\nfine-grained information of the person. We combine global features\nand local features to produce results. An initial coarse rank list is\nestablished using the global feature, and local features are used to\nperform more precisely matching on the rank list. With the first\nranking list obtained by measuring the global feature, we only con-\nduct local ranking on the top-N images (e.g., N=100) that appear in\nthe list. In nearly all the cases, top-N-selected images cover all the\ncorrect results of a query image.\n3.5 Loss\nIn the training process, we use cross entropy loss and triplet loss\nas the supervised classification signals. In every training step, we\nrandomly sample K samples of P pedestrians from the training\ndataset. For triplet loss, we use hard triplet loss [ 16]. The final\nlearning objective of pose-guided local featureseF𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒 is formulated\nas the following:\nL𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 = 1\n𝑝\n𝑝∑︁\n𝑖=1\n[L𝑐𝑙𝑠(f𝑖\n𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒)+L𝑡𝑟𝑖(f𝑖\n𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑒)], (15)\nwhere 𝑝is the number of pose-guided groups. Learning objective of\nfeatures f𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑒 and f𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ which contain information in the inter-\nand intra-part manner can be formulated as:\nL𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 = L𝑐𝑙𝑠(f𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑒 )+L𝑐𝑙𝑠(f𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ), (16)\nThe joint loss function is described below:\nL= L𝑙𝑜𝑐𝑎𝑙 +L𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙. (17)\nWith the loss function above, our model can better understand the\nstructural relationship of different part components.\n4 EXPERIMENTS\n4.1 Datasets\nOccluded-DukeMTMC dataset [21]. There are 15,618 images for\ntraining, 17,661 gallery images and 2,210 occluded query images\nfor testing. Training images contain about 9% occluded images and\nthe portion of occluded images in the gallery is around 10%. There\nalways exists one occluded image when computing the distance.\nMarket-1501 dataset [47]. The dataset includes 32,668 images\nof 1,501 identities. These pedestrians are captured by six cameras\nfrom different scenes and viewpoints. There are 12,936 training\nimages of 751 identities. The testing set contains the remaining\nimages. There is one label to represent the background.\nDukeMTMC-reID dataset [25, 48]. The dataset includes 36,411\nimages of 1,404 identities. There are eight different cameras to cap-\nture the person. This dataset selects 702 identities for training. The\nremaining images are for testing. In the testing phase, there is only\none query image of each person in each camera, and remaining\nimages are reserved for gallery.\n4.2 Implementation details\nModel architectures. For our feature extraction backbone, we use\nResNet50-ibn [12, 22] pretrained on ImageNet [5]. We drop its final\nGAP layer and fully connected layer to extend our module. For\npose estimation network, we use HR-Net [30] pretrained on COCO\ndataset [20] which follows the identical setting as [35]. Pose estima-\ntion network predicts a total of 17 keypoints, including head, joints\nof arms, and joints of legs. The parameters of the pose estimation\nnetwork are set to unchanged during training. We use three stacked\ntransformer units with 512 hidden dimensions in FFN, 0.1 dropout\nratio, and the ReLU activation layer. We set a threshold𝜏 as 0.001\nto filter the low confidence score. We use a BN layer to normalize\nour final embedding features. We use the modified early version of\nthe platform [14] to implement our method.\nTraning details. The input images are resized into 384 ×128.\nIn the training stage, batch size is set to 64 by selecting 16 different\nidentities and 4 samples for each identity. We choose some common\ndata augmentation strategies including padding 10 pixels, random\ncropping, horizontal flipping, and random erasing [49] with a prob-\nability of 0.5. During training, Adam optimizer is adopted. We set\nweight decay 5 ×10−4 and we train our model for 60 epochs with\ninitialized learning rate 3.5 ×10−4. The learning rate is warmed up\nfor 10 epochs first and decayed by cosine method from the 30th\nepoch to 1 ×10−6. The model is implemented with the pytorch\nframework and trained with two NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti.\nEvaluation metrics. For evaluation, cumulative matching char-\nacteristic curve and mean average precision (mAP) are adopted.\n4.3 Experimental Results\nResults on the occluded dataset. Our experiments are conducted\non the occluded Re-Id benchmark dataset with supervised setting,\nOccluded-DukeMTMC dataset [21]. Tab. 1 shows the comparisons\nover the dataset Occluded-DukeMTMC. Part-Aligned [ 44], PCB\n[32] and Adver Occluded [18] are designed for holistic ReID task.\nFD-GAN [9], Part Bilinear [ 29], PGFA [21], and HONet [ 35] use\nFigure 5: Comparison of retrieval results. The leftmost denotes query image which is followed by the ten closest matching\nresults (including the same camera).

DSR [13] does not use extra keypoints\ndetector.\nResults on holistic datasets. If one solution performs well\nin the occluded dataset, it should also perform well on holistic\ndatasets. To verify whether our method works on holistic datasets,\nwe compare our method with other methods for occluded Re-Id on\nholistic datasets Market-1501 [47] and DukeMTMC-reID [25, 48].\nTab. 2 shows that some methods perform well on the Occluded-\nDukeMTMC dataset, but have different performances on holistic\ndatasets. The method in [16] can outperform two other methods\nproposed by [21, 35], which indicates that simply using external\ninformation like keypoints might not achieve the best performance\non holistic datasets. We think it is mainly because holistic datasets\ncontain few occlusions, and the ability of these methods on ex-\ntracting and representing global information from the image to\ngenerate pedestrian features is relatively low. Occluded images in\nthe dataset contain massive noise caused by occlusions, and directly\nTable 2: The comparisons over the Market-1501 dataset and\nthe DukeMTMC-reID dataset.\nMethods Market-1501 DukeMTMC-reID\nmAP Rank-1 mAP Rank-1\nPCB [32] 77.4 92.3 66.1 81.8\nDSR [13] 64.3 83.6 - -\nFPR [16] 86.6 95.4 78.4 88.6\nVPM [31] 80.8 93.0 72.6 83.6\nPGFA [21] 76.8 91.2 65.5 82.6\nHONet [35] 84.9 94.2 75.6 86.9\nPirt (ours) 86.3 94.1 77.6 88.9\nusing the global feature leads to serious confusion. Semantic in-\nformation inside the global feature cannot make a good alignment\nto distinguish corresponding regions in images. In this case, we\nput forward different partition strategies and attention modules.\nOn the basis of ensuring the robustness of feature representation\nability, our method combines local features and global features for\nmore detailed alignment to achieve better results.\nIn Fig. 5 we make a rank list to compare our baseline with our\nproposed method. In the first row, our method finds the holistic\npedestrian according to visible parts in the query image. In the\nsecond and the third row, visible parts are fewer than occlusions\nthus baseline only capture obvious regions without considering\nthe relation between the person and the occlusion in the image.\nThe last row shows that our method more robustly removes the\nnoise generated by the information of another person. Our method\nshows the effectiveness to find occluded people.\nTable 3: Analysis of three different components: P represent\npose generation, Intra represents intra-part relational mod-\nule and Inter represents inter-part relational transformer.\nP Intra Inter mAP Rank-1\n× × × 43.40 51.81\n✓ × × 42.23 52.17\n✓ ✓ × 47.20 55.88\n✓ ✓ ✓ 50.90 60.00\nTable 4: The performances on different number of our trans-\nformer unit N.\nN mAP Rank-1\n1 48.93 57.51\n2 49.93 59.05\n3 50.90 60.00\n4 50.59 59.41\n4.4 Performance Analysis\nAblations studies. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod by reconstructing our model to verify the influences of\neach module. As shown in Tab. 3, our proposed module improves\nthe performance on the Occluded-DukeMTMC dataset. Baseline\nmethod uses only an individual feature vector extracted from the\nsingle backbone without using triplet loss function. Then we use\nHR-Net [30] to extract keypoints from the image and apply averaged\nlocal features to present each keypoint. We adopt a GMP and a GAP\nlayer to select representative features as local features in Tab. 3.\nFor each local feature, we use all the loss functions as described\nabove to constraint the local part feature. But extracting features\naccording to the keypoints from the backbone features hardly leads\nto a better result. DSR [ 13] shows another type of local features\nwhich consists of multiple max poolings with different scales. The\nfinal amount of the local features [13] is large and the used least\nsquare algorithm between two different local features set leads to\ninefficiency. Our method uses only three robust local features, and\nthe computational complexity is similar to the baseline.\nEffects of inter- and intra-part relational transformer. As\nshown in Tab. 3, we found that different dividing strategies applied\non the spatial features into parts and building the relationship\nbetween grids inside each part can give a positive effect to recognize\nthe person in the image as shown in Tab. 3. Different from [32], we\ndo not restrict each striped part using independent cross entropy\nloss and regard the divided parts as separate local features. With\nthe support of the attention mechanism, merging local features into\nglobal features well represents the pedestrian while eliminating\nlots of parameters. We visualize our model using its weight and\nactivation function as shown in Fig. 6.\nEffects of the number of our transformer units. Tab. 4 shows\nthe influence of the different numbers of transformer units on the\naccuracy. One layer of the transformer unit is insufficient for ex-\ntracting features. However, the person re-identification task heavily\nrelies on pretrained backbone weights, more encoder layers lead to\na tough training procedure while keeping a similar performance.\nFigure 6: Visualization on features generated by our pro-\nposed intra-part relational module.\nTable 5: The effects of different combinations of confidence\nscores on the matching results. Q and G represent confi-\ndence scores of query images and gallery images respec-\ntively.\nCombination Methods mAP Rank-1\nQ & G 50.90 60.00\nQ only 49.91 59.86\nG only 49.89 59.86\nNo confidence score 48.19 57.78\nAs a result, we set the number of transformer units to 3 to balance\nthe accuracy and the efficiency.\nEffects of confidence score combination method. Corre-\nsponding local features are measured by cosine distance and multi-\nplied with confidence scores generated by confidence score module.\nThere are four situations as shown in Tab. 5. The best performance\nis conducted in the first situation by simultaneously uniting two\nconfidence scores. The next two situations indicate that using only\none of the scores impairs the performances. The reason behind\nthis phenomenon mainly occurred in an occluded scene, e.g., differ-\nent degrees of occlusion on the corresponding part can get wrong\nmatching results. Ignoring potential confidence score influenced\nby occlusions may lead to a weak performances.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nWe propose a novel framework namely Pose-guided inter- and intra-\npart relational transformers for occluded person Re-Id. In the pose\ngeneration stage, our detected keypoints are naturally fused into\nour module to well represent the holistic object with part groups.\nWe combine these local part features with an attention mechanism\nto construct long-term correlations and provide a structural under-\nstanding of different part components by introducing transformer.\nWith these two complementary relationships constructed from dif-\nferent perspectives, our method reaches the new state of the art\non occluded person re-identification task and our experiments also\nshow the effectiveness of our model.\n6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThis work was supported by grants from National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (No. 61922006) and CAAI-Huawei MindSpore\nOpen Fund.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Bingyi Cao, André Araujo, and Jack Sim. 2020.
