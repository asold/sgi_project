  "abstract": "This study investigates prompt engineering (PE) strategies to mitigate hallucination, a key limitation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we explore five prominent multimodal PE techniques: in-context learning (ICL), chain of thought (CoT), step-by-step reasoning (SSR), tree of thought (ToT), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). These techniques are systematically applied across multiple datasets with distinct domains and characteristics. Based on the empirical findings, we propose the greedy prompt engineering strategy (Greedy PES), a methodology for optimizing PE application across different datasets and MLLM models. To evaluate user satisfaction with MLLM-generated responses, we adopt a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, S-BERT, MoverScore, and CIDEr. A weighted aggregate evaluation score is introduced to provide a holistic assessment of model performance under varying conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimal prompt engineering strategy varies significantly depending on both dataset properties and the MLLM model used. Specifically, datasets categorized as general benefit the most from ICL, ToT, and RAG, whereas mathematical datasets perform optimally with ICL, SSR, and ToT. In scientific reasoning tasks, RAG and SSR emerge as the most effective strategies. Applying Greedy PES leads to a substantial improvement in performance across different multimodal tasks, achieving an average evaluation score enhancement of 184.3% for general image captioning, 90.3% for mathematical visual question answering (VQA), and 49.1% for science visual question answering (VQA) compared to conventional approaches. These findings highlight the effectiveness of structured PE strategies in optimizing MLLM performance and provide a robust framework for PE-driven model enhancement across diverse multimodal applications.",
