INTRODUCTION\nWith technology advancements in semiconductor devices\nsuch as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), modern\nhigh-power medium voltage (MV) drives are increasingly\nused in petrochemical, mining, steel and metals, transporta-\ntion and other industries to conserve electric energy, increase\nproductivity and to improve product quality. Although re-\nsearch and development of the medium voltage drive, are con-\ntinuously growing, the literature dedicated to this technology\nseems to be very limited [1], [2]. Hence, the aim of this paper,\nis to propose a conﬁguration of medium voltage induction\nmotor drive (MVIMD) and their performances are proved by\nsimulations and test results.\nIn [3]–[5], several MVIMDs are reported. These show\nthe needs of multi-winding transformer (MWT) in case of\nMVIMD. Since, the IM voltage is in few kV and available\ngrid rating is in 33/11 kV . Hence this MWT matches the\nnominal stator voltage and connects several diode bridge\nrectiﬁer (DBR) in selected style, which cancel the harmonics\nproduced among BDRs. By doing this, it has made the supply\ncurrent similar to sinusoidal and decreased its THD to an\nadequate value [6], [7].\nThree types of conventional multilevel inverters namely\nneutral point clamped (NPC), ﬂying capacitor (FC) and cas-\ncaded topologies, are utilized in MVIMDs. A NPC-MLI has\ncapacitor voltage equalization issue. Several strategies have\nbeen reported in the literature to maintain the required volt-\nage across capacitor of NPC MLI [8], [9]. These modula-\ntion strategies are quite difﬁcult, and the difﬁculty increases\nas the number of level increases. In FC-MLI, apart from\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

These DC-link\nand ﬂying capacitor voltages must be supervised very pre-\ncisely for proper operation of ﬂying capacitor inverter [10],\n[11]. A cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel inverter (MLI) is\none of the popular inverter topologies for MVIMDs. Unlike\nother multilevel inverters, where high-voltage insulated gate\nbipolar transistors (IGBTs) are utilized, the CHB inverter nor-\nmally utilizes low-voltage IGBTs as a switching device in\na H-bridge power module (PM). The PMs are connected in\ncascaded manner to achieve medium voltage operation. This\nCHB-inverter has easy structure and simple control. More-\nover, the power rating in CHB-inverter, can be easily scaled to\nrequired value. Therefore, in this study, CHB-inverter is uti-\nlized. The CHB-inverter has been successfully implemented\nfor MVIMD in [12]–[14].\nIn the literature [12]–[14], an eighteen pulse AC-DC con-\nverter fed 7-level CHB-inverter based IMD is reported. In\n[12]–[14], a symmetrical CHB-inverter is used, which need 36\npower semiconductor switches and 9-isolated DC-supply. To\nget, these DC-supply using MWT a quite big MWT is needed.\nTherefore, in this work, a binary principle is used to choose\nthe DC voltages. By this principle, a 7-level CHB-inverter\nneeds 24 power semiconductor switches and 6-isolated DC-\nsupplies only. Moreover, to get 6-isolated DC-supply from\nMWT, a small size MWT is needed compared to the MWT\ngiven in [12]–[14]. Apart from it, in [12]–[14], the MWTs\nhave symmetrical voltage windings on both primary and sec-\nondary side. However, in the work, the MWT has asymmet-\nrical voltage secondary windings. The complete design equa-\ntion of this modiﬁed MWT is given in section III. From above\ndiscussion, it is realized that the conﬁguration of MVIMD\ngiven in this work, needs less electrical components. There-\nfore, the size and cost of the proposed MVIMD are quite less\nthan the existing MVIMD [12]–[14].\nIn [12]–[15], a 7-level CHB-inverter is controlled by si-\nnusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM). Therefore, the\nswitching frequency of 7-level CHB-inverter is high and these\nMVIMD has considerable switching losses. Due to it, these\nexisting MVIMDs have moderate efﬁciency. This problem\ncan be solved by utilizing fundamental frequency switching\n(FFS) to control this 7-level CHB-inverter. A selective har-\nmonic elimination (SHE) technique is most widely utilized\nin CHB-inverter to achieve FFS [16]–[18]. In SHE strategy,\nthe switching angles are calculated from transcendental equa-\ntions, which is a function of cosine terms and modulation\nindex. Therefore, in most of the literature, switching angles\nare calculated off-line at different values of modulation index\nand performance of CHB-inverter corresponding to each set of\nswitching angles, is analyzed. The calculation of the switch-\ning angles corresponding to each modulation index varying\nfrom 0 to 1, is not possible. It is because, quite complex and\ntime taking methods are utilized to solve the transcenden-\ntal equations. Therefore, for constant load voltage frequency\napplication or known modulation index application, SHE is\nquite good. However, SHE strategy becomes very complex for\napplications, where load voltage frequency and modulation\nFIGURE 1. Schematic of proposed system.\nindex are varying in nature. It is because, the algorithms to\nsolve transcendental equations are very stochastic and one\ncannot predict what going to happen, because it takes random\nsteps and one cannot be sure for the correct solution within the\nlimited time. Therefore, SHE is not utilized in this work. In the\nliterature [19], a nearest level modulation technique (NLMT)\nis reported. By utilizing NLMT, one can easily get the FFS\nof CHB-inverter. Moreover, in the case of NLMT, switch-\ning angles calculation is not required as like SHE technique.\nHowever, this modulation strategy is more suitable for higher\nnumbers of levels (more than 13-levels). It is because in this\nstrategy, predeﬁned levels are obtained from the quotient of\nratio (m ref/Sp), where, m ref is the instantaneous value of refer-\nences signal produced from indirect vector control (IVC). Due\nto this, if NLMT is utilized for 7-level CHB-inverter then the\noutput phase voltage symmetry is not maintained over a wide\nspeed range of IMD and the power quality of voltage and cur-\nrent at the motor terminals, is very poor. Therefore, a new area\nequalization modulation strategy (AEMS) is used here for\nbinary based 7-level CHB-inverter, to operate this at FFS over\na wide speed range operation of IMD. The complete theory\nand implementation of AEMS for IMD, are given in this study.\nII. SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\nThe schematic diagram of MVIMD is depicted in Fig. 1. Here,\nit is seen that the MWT conﬁgured eighteen-pulse converter is\nused. This MWT has /Delta1-connected primary and its secondary\nhas 6-windings and separated in two parts. First part has\n2-isolated delta polygon windings for +20° and −20° phase-\nshift and one /Delta1-connected windings. These are the manda-\ntory requirement for eighteen pulse converters. Second part\nhas similar conﬁguration as ﬁrst part. Whereas the winding\nvoltages of second part are two times the ﬁrst part. These six\n2 VOLUME 1, 2020\nisolated windings give six-isolated AC-supply, which are con-\nverted into six-isolated DC-supply by mean of DBR. These\nsix-isolated DC-supplies are the input for binary based 7-level\nCHB-inverter as depicted in Fig. 1. This inverter has 7-levels\n(0, ±vdc, ±2vdc, ±3vdc) in phase voltage and 13-levels in\nline voltage. The switching sequence for a-phase to get this\n7-level is given as ‘S 1S3S5S7’ for “0”, ‘S 1S2S5S7’ for “1”,\n‘S1S3S5S6’ for “2”, ‘S 1S2S5S6’ for “3”, ‘S 3S4S5S7’f o r“ −1”,\n‘S1S3S7S8’f o r“ −2”, ‘S 3S4S7S8’f o r“ −3”, in similar way\nsequences are found for ‘b’ and ‘c’ phases.\nIII. SYSTEM MODELLING\nThis system is depicted in Fig. 1. An eighteen-pulse converter\nis used as a front end and a 7-level CHB-inverter at drive end.\nHere, a 3-phase, 415 V , 50 Hz AC mains, is taken to operate\na 3-phase, 415 V , 50 Hz, 7.5 kW IM. The complete design\nand selection of required parameters of proposed VCIMD, are\ngiven here in detail.\nA. CALCULATION OF DC-LINK VOL TAGE\nA 7-level CHB-inverter is depicted in Fig. 1. Here, it is seen\nthat a 7-level CHB-inverter has two PMs in each leg. Typi-\ncally, V dc, and 2V dc voltages are utilized to produce 7-levels\nin phase voltage. Here, the switching sequence is taken in\nsuch a manner that the transition from one to other switching\nsequence, has minimal changes in it. The DC-link capacitor\nvoltage is obtained from,\nma =\nˆVan1\nB4Vdc /π . (1)\nWhere ma, ˆVan1, B and Vdc represent the modulation index,\npeak of fundamental phase voltage, number of PMs and DC\nvoltage, correspondingly. This equation is derived for sym-\nmetrical cascaded inverter-based conﬁguration. However, it\nholds good for both symmetrical and asymmetrical conﬁgu-\nration. Moreover, in case of symmetrical conﬁguration, ‘ B’\nis the number of H-bridge cells and in case of asymmetrical\nconﬁguration, ‘ B’ is a number of positive steps.\nFrom (1), ˆVan1 is calculated as,\nˆVan1 = maB4Vdc\nπ = 0.8 × 3 × 4Vdc\nπ = 3.056Vdc .\nThe rms of Van1 is obtained as,\nVan1 =\nˆVan1√\n2\n= 3.056Vdc√\n2\n= 2.164Vdc .\nTo meet the active power requirement of IMD, the Van1\nshould be equivalent to stator phase voltage ( Vst ph ).\nVan1 = 2.164Vdc = Vst ph = 239.6V .\nUtilizing binary methodology, a 7-level CHB-inverter\nshould have Vdc = 110 V and 2 Vdc = 220 V , to drive a 7.5 kW\nmotor.\nFIGURE 2. Conﬁguration of delta-polygon transformer and its vector\ndiagram.\nB. EIGHTEEN-PULSE CONVERTER\nThe conﬁguration of MWT is depicted in Fig. 1. The winding\nvoltages are obtained from the vector diagram depicted in\nFig. 2. The relation between output voltage ( Vdc ) and line in-\nput voltage ( VLL ) of a 6-pulse AC-DC conversion, is expressed\nas,\nVLL = πVdc\n3\n√\n2\n= π × 110\n3\n√\n2\n= 81.453 V .\nThe dependency among line voltages, small and large wind-\nings voltage of delta-polygon transformer, is obtained by uti-\nlizing /Delta1ABC as depicted in Fig. 2, and given as,\nVLL\nSin120 = VNS\nSinα = VNL\nSin(60 − α) . (2)\nAs mentioned earlier to get 18-pulse AC-DC conversion,\nα must be equivalent to 20°. The ‘ VNS ’ and ‘ VNL ’ winding\nvoltages for delta-polygon conﬁguration, are obtained here,\nVNS = Sin20\nSin120VLL = 32.168 V\nand\nVNL = Sin(60 − 20)\nSin120 VLL = 60.457 V.\nHere, a 7.5 kW IMD is utilized. Each leg of 7-level CHB-\ninverter has two PMs and they are coupled in cascaded fash-\nion as depicted in Fig. 1. The same amount of current ﬂows\nthrough the both PMs of each leg and their value is equivalent\nto the phase current of an IM. From aforementioned section,\nthe values of DC-link capacitor voltages, are obtained ( Vdc =\n110 V and 2 Vdc = 220 V). Here, it is assumed that the power\nof ﬁrst PM of each leg, is P1.\nVOLUME 1, 2020 3\nSINGH AND KANT: MUL TI-WINDING TRANSFORMER FOR 18-PULSE AC-DC CONVERTER FED 7-LEVEL CHB-INVERTER\nThe mathematical equation of power is expressed as,\nP1 + P2 = P1 + 2P1 = RatingofInductionMotor\n3 = 7.5kW\n3 .\n(3)\nIt is considered here that the losses are negligible. There-\nfore, input power = output power, and it is written as,\nVdc Idc = P1\nTherefore, the DC-link current is as,\nIdc = P1\nVdc\n= 833.33\n110 = 7.576 A\nwhere Vdc and Idc represent the DC-link voltage and current\nof a PM, respectively.\nThe value of ‘ Ia1’ for 6-pulse AC-DC conversion, is ex-\npressed here,\nIa1 = Ib1 = Ic1 =\n√\n2\n3 Idc = 0.8165Idc = 6.186 A .\nIn Fig. 2, the transformer has 2-windings in each phase.\nThe direction of each winding current of this transformer,\nis also depicted in Fig. 2. The currents in these windings, are\ncalculated from Fig. 2 and they are given as,\nIp1 = Ia1 − Ia2\n3 ,Ip2 = Ia2 − Ia3\n3 and Ip3 = Ia3 − Ia1\n3\nIp1 = 6.186∠0◦ − 6.186∠− 120◦\n3 = 3.571∠30◦ A. (4)\nIn this work, a transformer is utilized on the grid side,\nwhich has /Delta1-conﬁgured input windings and its output has\n6-windings. Its output has four delta-polygon conﬁgured and\ntwo simple /Delta1-conﬁgured windings as depicted in Fig. 1. The\nsummation of ampere-turns at transformer core must be zero.\nTherefore, the ampere-turns of this transformer, are ex-\npressed here,\nId1Np − Ip1N1L + Ip3N1s − Id4N1d − Ip4N1L + Ip6N1s\n− Ip7N2L + Ip9N2s − Id7N2d − Ip10N2L + Ip12N2s = 0.\n(5)\nIt results in,\nId1 = Ip1\n( N1L\nNp\n)\n− Ip3\n( N1s\nNp\n)\n+ Id4\n( N1d\nNp\n)\n+ Ip4\n( N1L\nNp\n)\n− Ip6\n( N1s\nNp\n)\n+ Ip7\n( N2L\nNp\n)\n− Ip9\n( N2s\nNp\n)\n+ Id7\n( N2d\nNp\n)\n+ Ip10\n( N2L\nNp\n)\n− Ip12\n( N2s\nNp\n)\nId1 = 6.2443A.\nThe kV A rating of this transformer, is obtained from [8] as,\nTransformer,kV A=0.5 ∑ Vrms Irms\n1000 (6)\n=\n0.5 ×\n⎡\n⎢⎣\n3VphId1 + 3V1NL 1Ip1 + 3V1NS 1Ip3 + 3V1NL 2Ip4\n+3V1NS 2Ip6 + 3V1dp h Id4 + 3V2NL 1Ip7 + 3V2NS 1Ip9\n+3V2NL 2Ip10 + 3V2NS 2Ip11 + 3V2dp h Id7\n⎤\n⎥⎦\n1000\n= 8.1604 kV A.\nThe kV A rating of proposed MWT must be greater than\n8.1604 kV A to operate a 7.5 kW motor.\nIV . CONTROL ALGORITHMS\nAn IVC is used to run IM and an AEMS is utilized to run a\n7-level MLI. Here, an IVC is utilized to achieve independent\ncontrol of ﬂux and torque of IMD. This IVC produces three\nvoltage signals ( va, vb and vc). These are input of AEMS.\nAforementioned controls are elaborated herein in detail.\nA. IVC\nThe structure of IVC control is depicted in Fig. 3(a). In it,\nthe speed error is obtained from reference and sensed speed,\nwhich is input to PI controller and then reference q-axis cur-\nrent is estimated from this PI output. The ﬁeld weakening\ntechnique is employed to obtain the d-axis current. These d\nand q axes currents are compared with sensed d and q axes\ncurrents. The error signals from these comparators are given\nto PI controllers, which gives the d and q axes voltages and it\nconverted into abc co-ordinates. These v a,v b and v c are the\ninput for AEMS [6], [7].\nB. AREA EQUALIZATIONS MODULATION STRATEGY\nTo achieve fundamental frequency switching, an AEMS is\nused in this work. In this modulation strategy, the steps in the\nVSI output voltage, are independent of the time and hence\nits frequency is not predeﬁned. The frequency of VSI output\nvoltage, depends on modulating signals. The plots of refer-\nence signals and VSI output voltage, are depicted in Fig. 3(b).\nTo obtained α1, α2 and α3, one may consider x1, x2, x3, x4,\nx5 and x6, which have same value and their summation must\nbe equal to the peak of ˆVan, which indicates that area A 1 is\nidentical to area A 2. Now considering, ˆVan is equal to 1 p.u.\nand from Fig. 3(b). These are calculated as,\nsin α1 = X1\nα1 = sin−1 (X1 ) = sin−1 (1/6) = 9.594◦ (7)\nsin α2 = X1 + X2 + X3\nα2 = sin−1 (X1 + X2 + X3 ) = sin−1 (3/6) = 30◦ (8)\nsin α3 = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5\nα3 = sin−1 (X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5 )\n= sin−1 (5/6) = 56.443◦. (9)\n4 VOLUME 1, 2020\nFIGURE 3. Control strategy of proposed system (a) block diagram of IVC,\n(b) reference and phase voltage waveforms for an AEMS and (c) ﬂowchart\nfor an implementation of AEMS.\nFrom these expressions, one can generalize the angle cal-\nculation for N-level inverter as,\nαi = sin−1 (\n(i − 0.5)/Np\n)\n(10)\nwhere Np = (N − 1)/2 and i = 1,2 ....... Np. In case of a\n7-level CHB Np = 3 and i = 1, 2 and 3.\nFrom (10), the switching angles are calculated for a 7-level\nCHB-inverter. In order to maintain the symmetry of inverter\nphase voltage, the height reference signal for every switching\nangle should be of same ratio. The heights ( H1, H2 and H3)\nare calculated for unity peak,\nH1 = sin (α1 ) = sin (9.594) = 0.1667\nH2 = sin (α2 ) = sin (30) = 0.5000\nH3 = sin (α3 ) = sin (56.443) = 0.8333.\nCorresponding to peak magnitude ( are f ) of the reference\nsignal, the angles are re-calculated as,\nα1= sin−1(aref ×H1 )\nα2= sin−1(aref ×H2 )\nα3= sin−1(aref ×H3 )\n⎫\n⎪⎪⎬\n⎪⎪⎭\n. (11)\nTo get seven levels in phase voltage, the value of α1, α2 and\nα3, is calculated using AEMS from (10). It is assumed that\nthe modulating signal has sinusoidal waveform with peaks of\n+1 and −1. From these three angles, nine more angles ( α4\n= 180° −α3, α5 = 180° −α2, α6 = 180° −α1, α7 = 180° +\nα1, α8 = 180° + α2, α9 = 180° + α3, α10 = 360° −α3, α11\n= 360° −α2 and α12 = 360° −α1) are calculated to get the\ndesired 7-levels in phase voltage. The magnitude of the sine\nwaveform is calculated at different values of α (α1 to α12)\nand denoted by Y1 to Y12 (Y1 = sin(α1), similarly for Y2\nto Y12), respectively. The modulating signals have also si-\nnusoidal waveforms and their magnitude varies from +1t o\n−1. The instantaneous magnitude of the modulating signal is\nmeasured and denoted by ‘ mre f ’. There are two magnitude\nquantities, one ( Y1 to Y12) is ﬁxed to get predeﬁned level\nand other one ( mre f ) is varying between +1 and −1. From\nFig. 3(b), it is observed that, if 0 < mre f ≤ Y1 then “0” level\nis required, to get it, switching sequence is carefully selected.\nIn same fashion, the value of ‘ mre f ’ is compared throughout\nthe cycle with predeﬁned values ( Y1 to Y12) and according to\nthe value of ‘ mre f ’, one can know that which level is required\nat that instant. Then according to required level, switching pat-\ntern is carefully chosen and accordingly 7-level CHB-inverter\nis switched to get that level in phase voltage. From this, it is\nseen that the angle calculation in this AEMS is quite easy.\nThe step by step procedure to implement AEMS, is given in\nFig. 3(c).\nV . SIMULA TED RESUL TS\nThis system is designed and developed in Simulink/ MA T-\nLAB platform and simulated results are depicted here. The\nparameters of IMD is listed in Appendix.

EXPERIMENT AL PERFORMANCES\nA prototype of the system is developed with a DSP (dSPACE-\nDS1006). The parameters of IMD, which are used in the\nimplementation, are given in Appendix. An indirect vector\ncontrol is implemented by means of two Hall-Effect current\nsensors (LA-55p) and one speed sensor. Three reference volt-\nages signals ( va, vb and vc) produced from an IVC, are given\nto AEMS, which generates pulses to control a 7-level inverter\nas per the drive requirement. The characteristics of the drive\nare depicted here at varying operating conditions of IMD,\nto demonstrate input voltage ( vs ), input current ( is ), stator\nline voltage ( vst ), current ( ist ), speed ( ωm ), d-axis current\n(id ), q-axis current ( iq ) and torque ( Te ). The photograph of\nprototype is depicted in Fig. 5.\nA. STEADY STATE PERFORMANCES\nThe transformer secondary winding currents ( is1, is2, is3 and\nis4) waveforms are depicted in Fig. 6(a). First three plots of\nthis ﬁgure, show the currents drawn by the ﬁrst group. They\nshow identical waveforms. However, there is a time phase\nshift in them. Since of phase shifts of +20°, 0° and −20°\namong three sets of voltages, the last current waveform ( is4 )\nof this ﬁgure, represents the current of second group, which\nfeeds the power to the second PM of each leg, with 2V dc\nvoltage. This current is plotted once more in Fig. 6(b) to study\nperformance of all secondary winding currents of MWT. The\nbehavior of second groups currents is plotted in Fig. 6(b).\nThe currents ( is4, is5 and is6) waveforms in Fig. 6(b), have\nsimilar patterns, though, there is a time shift in them. These\ncurrents (is1, is2, is3, is4, is5 and is6) of the multi-winding trans-\nformer, are transferred to input side and the resulting current\n(is ) waveform, is depicted in Fig. 6(b). This current represents\nan 18-pulse input current waveform. The transformer wind-\nings currents given in Fig. 4(b) and also given in Figs. 6(a)–\n6(b).

TRANSIENT RESPONSE\nThe starting behavior of the system is depicted in Figs. 7(a)–\n7(b). Here, the primarily speed is set to 1100 rpm. The motor\nspeed (sensed speed) of the IMD, is depicted in Fig. 7(b),\nwhich is started from zero and moving to pre-set speed\n(1100 rpm). The behavior of MVIMD at change of the load,\nis depicted in Figs. 7(c)–7(d). In these waveforms, IMD is\noperating at 10% of nominal load. Then the load is raised to\nnominal value.

CONCLUSION\nA delta-polygon eighteen-pulse AC-DC conversion fed 7-\nlevel CHB-inverter driven MVIMD has been used to enhance\n8 VOLUME 1, 2020\nthe power quality at front end and motor end. An eighteen\npulse AC-DC conversion has made ‘i s’ almost sinusoidal with\nless THD within adequate limit according to the IEEE-519\nstandard. A 7-level MLI has been used in this work to reduce\nthe numbers of power semiconductor switches and required\nless numbers of DC-supplies. Due to which, the MVIMD has\nless size and low cost than existing IMD. An IVC has been uti-\nlized to control an IM and to achieve better dynamic response\nof the IMD than scalar control. An AEMS has been proposed\nto operate 7-level CHB-inverter as per drive requirement. The\ninverter output voltage frequency is dependent on reference\nvoltage signal generated from an IVC. A 7-level CHB-inverter\nfed IM has improved the performance of MVIMD. The AEMS\noperates a 7-level MLI at FFS, which decreases switching\nlosses and enhances the efﬁciency of MVIMD. The perfor-\nmances of MVIMD have been experimentally achieved to\nconﬁrm the decent operation of delta-polygon eighteen-pulse\nAC-DC converter-fed 7-level CHB-inverter based MVIMD\nwith allowable THD of voltage and current on grid side.\nAPPENDIX\nParameters of a 7.5 kW (10 hp), 4 pole, 415 V , 50 Hz, R s =\n0.044 pu, R r = 0.0305 pu, L ls = 0.0665 pu, L lr = 0.0665 pu,\nLm = 1.642 pu and J = 0.10 kg-m 2.\nREFERENCES\n[1] K.
