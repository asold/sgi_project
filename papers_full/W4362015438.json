  "abstract": "The imbalance of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) data will lead to over-fitting, weak generalization and poor recognition performance for fault diagnosis models based on deep learning. To handle this problem, a novel transformer fault diagnosis method based on improved auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (ACGAN) under imbalanced data is proposed in this paper, which meets both the requirements of balancing DGA data and supplying accurate diagnosis results. The generator combines one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and long short-term memories (LSTM), which can deeply extract the features from DGA samples and be greatly beneficial to ACGAN's data balancing and fault diagnosis. The discriminator adopts multilayer perceptron networks (MLP), which prevents the discriminator from losing important features of DGA data when the network is too complex and the number of layers is too large. The experimental results suggest that the presented approach can effectively improve the adverse effects of DGA data imbalance on the deep learning models, enhance fault diagnosis performance and supply desirable diagnosis accuracy up to 99.46%. Furthermore, the comparison results indicate the fault diagnosis performance of the proposed approach is superior to that of other conventional methods. Therefore, the method presented in this study has excellent and reliable fault diagnosis performance for various unbalanced datasets. In addition, the proposed approach can also solve the problems of insufficient and imbalanced fault data in other practical application fields.",
