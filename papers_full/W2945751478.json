INTRODUCTION\nLayered transition metal disulﬁdes (LTMDs) have received\nconsiderable attentions as one of the most two-dimensi-\nonal (2D) materials recently, and LTMDs have overcome the\nshortcomings of the zero band gap exists in another two-\ndimensional carbon-based nanomaterial graphene [1], [2],\ngreatly expanding the sensing applications of these new mate-\nrials, which exhibit strong anisotropy in mechanics, electric-\nity, thermodynamics, etc. For example, both WSe 2 and MoS2\nshow obvious features, such as indirect-direct Band gap\ncrossing, topological superconductivity, interlayer tunable\nband gap and selective photoexcitation [3]–[5]. The unique\nproperties of LTMDs make it a promising application in ﬁelds\nof ﬁeld effect transistors, ﬂexible electronics, optoelectron-\nics, electronics, electrocatalysts and photocatalysts [6]–[9].\nThis work focuses on the large surface/volume ratios, high\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Sanket Goel.\nelectron activity and sensitivity of layered two-dimensional\nmaterials [10]–[16], which may therefore be potential for\nsensor applications. In addition, recent reports have con-\nﬁrmed that transition metal (TM) doping LTMDs can greatly\nenhance their sensitive response to gas molecules, which\ncan be attributed to strong orbits interaction between gas\nmolecules and the doped TM atoms [17].\nOil-immersed power transformers account for more\nthan 90% of all types of transformers, considered to be\nthe most important and valuable equipment in power sys-\ntems [18]. However, there exists very phenomenon in the\nlong-running transformers, such as the overheating of insu-\nlation oil or isolating paper, partial discharge, arc dis-\ncharge, spark discharge, water ingress and dampness, natural\naging, etc. When those situations happen in the oil-immersed\npower transformer, the transformer oil suffers electricity and\nheat, which would produce low molecular hydrocarbons,\ni.e. Methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2H6), ethylene (C 2H4), acety-\nlene (C 2H2), and H 2, CO, CO 2 and other gases [19]–[21].\n72012\n2169-3536 \n 2019 IEEE.

Chenet al.: DGA in Transformer Oil Using Pt-Doped WSe2 Monolayer Based on First Principles Method\nThe composition and content of such mixed gas are closely\nrelated to the type of fault and severity of transformer failure,\nbesides, to some extent the failure happened in the trans-\nformer means a serious electrical accident, such as a large-\nscale blackout. So monitoring the composition and content\nof gases dissolved in the oil is essential to ensure the stable\noperation of the power system and prevent damage to the\nnational economy. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) in trans-\nformer oil has become an important method for monitoring\ntransformer equipment [22] and is widely considered as a\nfeasible and important method for estimating the operating\nstate of oil-ﬁlled power transformers by detecting typical dis-\nsolved gases. Currently, there are two major methods for gas\ndetection, namely, electrical and optical methods [23]–[25],\namong which gas sensor belongs to the category of elec-\ntrical detection methods. At present, there are continuous\nresearches to propose the use of different materials and their\nmodiﬁed or doped materials for making gas sensors for on-\nline monitoring of gas concentration and types [26]–[29],\namong which there are studying which concern about such\napplication in online monitoring of dissolved gases in insu-\nlating oil [30]–[32], which is a forward-looking approach\nbecause of the advantages of simple structure, fast response,\nlow cost, low power consumption and so on.\nIn this work, Pt-doped single-layer WSe 2 (Pt-WSe2)\nwas proposed as a promising sensing material for detect-\ning dissolved gases in transformer oil. At ﬁrst, the possi-\nble stable structure of single-layer Pt-WSe 2 was studied.\nThe stable structure with the lowest energy was selected\nto the adsorption study with three typical gases, includ-\ning CO, CH 4 and C2H2. The geometric and electronic struc-\ntures of the three adsorption systems were analyzed, which\nobtained the adsorption situation of molecules on the single\nlayer of Pt-WSe 2. In addition, the sensing principle of the\nmaterial surface is described to provide evidence for its appli-\ncation as a potentially superior gas sensing material in DGA.\nII. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD\nFirst-principles calculations have been performed in the\nframework of DFT using Dmol 3 package of materials stu-\ndio [33], [34]. The unrestricted density functional theory\nplus dispersion (DFT-D) calculation were performed in this\nwork [35], [36]. The exchange-correlation energy was cal-\nculated by the generalized approximation (GGA) method\nwith the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) function [37]–[40].\nThis method is widely utilized used in the calculation of\nmaterials and their surfaces with DFT calculation. This work\napplied The Tkatchenko and Schefﬂer’s (TS) method to cor-\nrect the Van der Waals’ force for obtaining more accurate\nresults [41], [42]. The DFT Semi-core Pseudopods (DSSP)\nand the double numerical atomic orbital augmented by\nd-polarization (DNP) were used. The energy convergence tol-\nerance, the maximum force and the maximum displacement\nof geometry optimizations were 1 .0×10−5 Ha, 0.002 Ha/Å\nand 0.005Å [43]. The global orbital cutoff radius was set\nat 5.0Å. The Brillouin zone is sampled using a 8 ×8 ×1\nFIGURE 1. Structures of gases (a) CO; (b) C2H2; (c) CH4.\nMonkhorst-Pack k-point grid for the calculation of densities\nof states (DOS), in the meantime, a 3 ×3×1 Monkhorst-Pack\nk-point grid for others.\nWe obtain an optimized lattice parameter of 3.282 Å\nwhich is consistence with other researches and experiment\nresults in literature [3] and [5], which proves the accuracy\nof simulation parameter setting. A (4 ×4) supercell includ-\ning 16 W and 32 Se is built with a vacuum region of c =15 Å\nin order to avoid the interaction with adjacent layers.\nThe adsorption energy (Ead) of gas adsorption process were\ncalculated by the following equation:\nEad =Emolecular/Pt−WSe2 −Emolecular −EPt-WSe2 (1)\nwhere the E molecular/Pt-WSe2, E molecular and E Pt-WSe2 donated\nenergy of the adsorption system, isolated Pt-WSe 2 and gas\nmolecule, respectively.\nIn addition, the Mullikan population analysis were con-\nsidered to analyze the charge transfer (Q t) between the gas\nmolecule and the surface, characterized by deformation elec-\ntron value by gas molecule after adsorption. In this work,\nIf Q t >0, it means that electrons transfer from Pt-WSe 2 to\ngas molecule and when Q t <0, the electrons transfer from\ngas molecule to Pt-WSe 2.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. GAS MOLECULAR AND Pt-WSe2 STRUCTURE\nBefore the adsorption behavior study, the molecular struc-\ntures of the gases (CO, CH 4, C 2H2) was geometrically opti-\nmized to obtain the most stable structure. The optimal gas\nstructure is shown in Fig. 1. The geometric structure is con-\nsistent with the previous literatures [18], [22]. The C-O bond\nlength of CO molecule is 1.146 Å, and the molecular structure\nof C 2H2 is linear, in which the C-C bond and C-H bond are\n1.214 Å and 1.072 Å, respectively, while CH 4 is a regular\noctahedral structure with a C-H bond length of 1.098 Å.\nThe carbon atom with sp hybridized orbital has stronger\nelectronegativity than that of CH 4 with sp 3 hybridization,\nso the C-H bond of the C 2H2 molecule is shorter than CH 4.\nThe Pt-WSe 2 monolayer was modeled as single Pt atom\nadsorption onto the intrinsic WSe 2 monolayer, where four\nVOLUME 7, 2019 72013\nZ.

(a) WSe2; (b) Pt-WSe2; (c) DOS; (d) DOS of Pt which doped\ninto WSe2.\npossible sites were considered, marked as T H (above the\ncenter of the hexagonal ring of WSe 2), T W (at the top of\nthe W atom), T Se (at the top of Se atom) and T B (the\nbridge site between two Se atoms), respectively. The struc-\ntural energy at different doping sites is obtained by geomet-\nric optimization. The lower the energy, the more stable the\nstructure. By comparison, the T W doping method with the\nlowest energy was chosen to perform the following gases\nadsorption studies. The geometry and DOS diagram before\nand after doping are shown in Fig. 2. The distance between\nthe Pt atom and the Se atom is 2.423 Å. After doping,\nFIGURE 3. Movement of Pt atom on WSe2.\nDOS appears to move left, resulting from the electrons of\nWSe2 are attracted by Pt atoms, making the Fermi level\nshifting to the right. As shown, it can also be seen that the\nwidth of band gap is reduced after doping.\nSince the band structure near the Fermi level determines\nthe physical properties of the conductivity, only the DOS\nbetween −4eV and 3eV near the Fermi level is given in\nFIG. 2(d). The energy at the Fermi level is usually set\nto 0eV, and the other energies are taken as the relative values\nof the Fermi level. In combination with partial density of\nstates (PDOS), it can be seen from the Fig 3(d) that the p and d\norbital electron of Pt atoms make contribution to the conduc-\ntion band and valence band of WSe 2 and Pt s orbital electronic\ncontribute to the conduction band only, it is worth noting that\nin the position of about 1.3 eV, due to the contribution of\nPt atom each orbital electron(s, p, d), it’s resulting in that\nthe gap between the conduction band and valence band gap\ndecreases, seen in the position (about 1.3 eV) of Pt-WSe 2\nDOS in ﬁgure 2(c).\nIn order to study the stability of the Pt atom on the surface\nof the two-dimensional WSe2, as shown in Fig. 3, the reaction\nenergy barrier of the Pt metal atom moving from T W to\nanother nearest T W is calculated, and the calculated energy\nbarrier value is 0.42 eV. Because it is smaller than the critic\nbarrier of Pt atom, 0.81eV [44], this study suggests that\nmethods should be taken to prevent the agglomeration of\nPt atoms on the surface of WSe 2 in the Pt-doped WSe 2\nexperiment [45], such as the method of freeze-drying and\nso on.\nB. ADSORPTION BEHAVIOUR ANALYSIS OF DISSOVED\nGASES ON Pt-WSe2 MONOLAYER\nThe lowest energy optimal adsorption is obtained by putting\nclosely gas molecules to the surface of Pt-WSe 2 at different\nplacement sites. Fig. 4 shows the most stable adsorption struc-\nture and corresponding deformation charge density (DCD) of\nthe different gases (C 2H2, CH 4, CO) on Pt-WSe 2, the infor-\nmation shown in TABLE 1 include the distance of different\natoms, adsorption energy and charge transfer.\n72014 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ.

Parameters for gases adsorption system: Adsorption energy,\ntotal charge transfer, distance.\nThe most stable adsorption structure of C 2H2 system and\nits DCD are shown in Fig. 4(a). The C atom of C 2H2 molecule\nis strongly attracted by Pt atoms. The distance between Pt-C is\nonly 1.084 Å, which is smaller than the distance 1.280 Å\nof C-C bond in gas molecules. The reaction between gas\nmolecule with Pt-WSe 2 is strong. The molecular structure\nof C 2H2 is severely deformed due to the adsorption effect\nfrom the Pt-WSe2. The molecular structure no longer appears\nlinear and bends, and the C-C bond is stretched from 1.214 Å\nto 1.280 Å, an increase of 0.076 Å. There is also a ten-\nsile phenomenon in the C-H bond, which indicates that the\nC2H2 molecule is activated. It can be known from the calcu-\nlation of the adsorption energy that the adsorption energy is as\nhigh as −2.040eV (the negative sign indicates that the adsorp-\ntion process is an exothermic process), and it is proved that the\nadsorption is very strong and belongs to chemical adsorption.\nThrough Mulliken charge analysis and DCD analysis, it was\nfound that C 2H2 transferred 0.153e electrons to the surface\nof the 2D material. The gas molecule acts as electron donor,\nand the transferred electrons mostly surround the Pt atoms,\nreﬂecting the common characteristics of transition metals:\nstrong electron acceptor property. All the above phenomena\nindicate that C 2H2 gas molecule have a strong adsorption on\nthe surface.\nIn terms of CH 4 adsorption system, the optimal adsorption\nstructure and the corresponding DCD are shown in Fig. 4(b),\nthe CH 4 gas molecule tends to approach Pt-WSe 2 through\nthe H atom, and the shortest adsorption distance between\nthem is 1.923 Å, and the corresponding adsorption energy\nis −0.474eV. The C-H bond in the gas molecule is slightly\nstretched, extending from 1.098 Å to 1.144 Å. The adsorption\nof CH 4 system is not strong than C 2H2’s, which belongs to\nthe range of physical adsorption. According to the Mulliken\nanalysis, CH 4 loses 0.181e electrons, and the gas acts as an\nelectron donor, which is the same as the C 2H2 analyzed in the\nupper part.\nSimilarly, Fig. 4(c) shows the optimal adsorption struc-\nture and corresponding DCD for the CO adsorption system.\nCO is trapped by the metal atom Pt through the C atom, and\nthe distance of C-Pt is 1.967 Å. In the adsorption system,\nthe C-O molecule is stretched, the C-O bond is extended from\n1.146 Å to 1.177 Å, and the adsorption energy is as high\nas −2.649 eV. A strong chemical reaction occurs between\nCO and Pt-WSe 2, in the meantime, CO transfers 0.100e\nelectrons to Pt-WSe 2.\nC. DOS ANALYSIS OF DISSOLED GASES\nON Pt-WSe2 MONOLAYER\nTo further explore the interaction mechanism between gas\nmolecules and surface, Fig. 5 shows the density of states\nincluding the electron orbitals of each atom.\nThe DOS of the Pt-WSe 2/C2H2 system is shown\nin Fig. 5(a), the electron behavior in the adsorption reaction\ncan be obtained by comparison with Pt-WSe 2 before and\nafter adsorption. As shown in Fig. 5 (a1), the electron density\nTDOS after adsorption increased at −15 eV, −4 eV, and a\nnew peak appeared near −9 eV,−8 eV, compared to Pt-WSe2\nbefore adsorption. This is due to the adsorption of C 2H2.\nFrom Figure 5 (a3), it can be clearly seen that the DOS\nof the C 2H2 molecule before and after adsorption, the gas\nmolecule DOS moves to the left after adsorption, and the\npeaks appearing at 15eV,−9eV,−8eV, and−4eV of adsorbed\nC2H2 molecule in Fig. 5 (a3) correspond exactly to that\nin Fig. 5(a1), which means C 2H2 has a strong adsorption\neffect on the surface of the material. The DOS of C 2H2\ndecreased after adsorption, which was caused by the loss\nof electrons in gas molecules, consistent with the before\nmentioned Mulliken analysis results. In Fig. 5 (a1), DOS is\nslightly shifted to the right after adsorption, combined with\nthe electron transfer direction, it is determined that this is due\nto fact that the adsorbed gas molecule transfers electrons to\nthe material, and thus the Fermi level shifts to the left. From\nFig. 5 (a2), it can be observed that the peaks of Pt 4d and C 2p\nin the system show signiﬁcant overlap around −15 eV,−9 eV,\n−8 eV, −1 eV, 0 eV and 2 eV, where exists serious orbital\nhybridization, indicating electron orbit interaction between\nVOLUME 7, 2019 72015\nZ.

DOS distribution of different gas adsorption systems.\nPt and C 2H2 is very strong, and it is exactly the orbital\nhybridization of C atom and Pt atom that causes the move-\nment of the peak position of the electronic density of state\nin Fig. (a2), showing the left shift of C 2H2 after adsorption.\nFig. 5(b) shows the DOS of the Pt-WSe 2/CH4 system,\nand Fig. 5(b1) shows the total density of states (TDOS) of\nthe Pt-WSe 2 with adsorption or not. There are no obvious\nchanges, only certain degrees of overlap at −13eV, −6eV.\nThe 1s orbital electrons of the H atom captured by Pt-WSe 2\nFIGURE 6.

(d) CO system.\nonly appear somewhat obvious hybridization with the\n4d orbital electrons of the Pt atom at the level of about −16eV.\nThese phenomena indicate that the adsorption strength is a\nlittle weak.\nSimilarly, Fig. 5(c) shows the DOS of the Pt-WSe 2/CO\nsystem, as shown in Fig. 5 (c1). Although the overall TDOS\ndoes not change a lot, it doesn’t draw the conclusion that the\nadsorption is not strong. It can be seen from Fig. 5 (c3) that\nthe DOS distribution of CO gas molecules after adsorption is\nbetween −10eV and −6eV, and in the same interval of 5(c1),\ntwo new peaks appear in TDOS, what’s more, signiﬁcant\norbital hybridization occurred between C 2p electrons and\nPt 4d electrons at −9eV,−7eV and −6eV energy level, indi-\ncating the strong adsorption between the CO and Pt-WSe 2.\nD. SENSING BEHAVIOR PREDICTION OF\nPt-WSe2 MONOLAYER FOR DGA\nIn the electronic mechanism, Pt as a dopant changes the\nelectrostatic potential of the surface of the WSe 2 due to\ndifferent electron afﬁnities, resulting in a change of the sur-\nface barrier height, that is, the change occurs in the corre-\nsponding semiconductor resistance value. The gas molecules\nare captured by the surface through the Pt atom. Besides,\nthe Pd atom acts as a catalyst to enhance the adsorption\nof the gas molecules and accelerate the electron exchange\nbetween the sensor and the test gas [46]. Resistive gas sen-\nsors detect gas by detecting changes in the resistance of gas\nsensitive materials before and after adsorption with different\ngas molecules. Based on the frontier orbital theory, it could\ndirectly react to the cause of change in conductivity. As shown\nin Fig. 6, the ﬁgure shows the HOMO and LUMO before and\nafter adsorption. Before the gas molecules are adsorbed on\nPt-WSe2 surface, the HOMO and LUMO mainly distribute on\nthe side of the Pt doping site, and the band gap width between\nHOMO and LUMO is 1.299 eV. As shown in Fig. 6(b)-(d),\nwhen the adsorbed gas molecules interact with the surface\nof Pt-WSe2, the orbital distribution of HOMO and LUMO is\nsigniﬁcantly extended to the gas molecules, and the molecu-\nlar adsorption makes the band gap of the system varying in\n72016 VOLUME 7, 2019\nZ. Chenet al.: DGA in Transformer Oil Using Pt-Doped WSe2 Monolayer Based on First Principles Method\ndifferent degrees. All the three change is the increasing in the\nwidth of the band gap. The inﬂuence of the three gases on the\nchange of Pt-WSe 2 band gap after adsorption is as follows:\nCO>CH4 >C2H2.\nIt is known that the relationship between resistivity\nand band gap can be determined by the following for-\nmula [47], [48]:\nσ αe(−Eg/2kBT) (2)\nwhere σ(Siemens (S)), T (Kelvin (K)) indicate the conductiv-\nity of the sensing material and the test temperature, and k B is\nthe Boltzmann constant.\nAccording to the molecular orbital theory, the increase of\nthe band gap value means that the charge transfer in the\nsystem is more difﬁcult, that is, when the temperature is\nconstant, the conductivity is inversely proportional to the\nwidth of band gap, and the wider the band gap, the more\ndifﬁcult it is for the electron to be excited from the valence\nband to the conduction band, which’s external performance\nis the increase in resistance. Therefore, we believe that all\nthree gases adsorption will lead to the increase in the system\nresistivity. The gas molecule reacts with the surface of the\n2D material, and there is electron transfer between them\nchanging the band gap width of the material. The Pt doped\nWSe2 electron holes concentration is much higher than the\nfree electron concentration, which belongs to the p-type semi-\nconductor. As the reducing gas (CO, CH 4 and C2H2) adsorb-\ning on the p-type semiconductor, the gas transfers electrons\nto the semiconductor, which makes the number of holes in\nthe semiconductor decreases, that is, the decrease of carriers\nleads to the increase of resistance. It needed to be noted that\ntheoretical calculation of the frontier orbit can only be carried\nout when the k value is set to 1 ×1 ×1. The accuracy of this\nsetting is insufﬁcient, but even so, combine with the forbidden\nband width marked in FIG. 6, which is obtained when the\nk value is set to 8 ×8×1, the result can still provide guidance\nqualitatively the change trend of resistivity before and after\nadsorption.\nIn order to better understand the sensing performance of\nPt-WSe2, we need to discuss the diffusion behavior of gases\non the material. The study placed different gases on different\nsites (T w, T Se and T hollow) on the material surface for DFT\ncalculation. However, the results showed that when the gas\nmolecules are placed on the site (T w, TSe and Thollow) which is\nnear Pt atoms, the molecules would move to the top of Pt and\nbe captured by Pt within the simulation. This is because the\nactivity of Pt is strong than others. Basing on that, we thought\ngas diffusion behavior on surface can be ignored. To verify\nthe above conclusion further, the adsorption energy of the\nthree gas molecules on the different sites of pure WSe 2 was\ngiven, seen in table 2.\nThe adsorption of gas adsorption on intrinsic selenide\ntungsten surface shown in table 2 is much lower than that\non Pt-WSe 2, concluding that gas molecules will not spread\nin the Pt-WSe 2 surface, but will ﬁrmly adsorbed onto the\nPt atoms. Moreover, the adsorption energy is the energy\nTABLE 2. Adsorption energy for gases adsorbing on intrinsic Selenide\ntungsten under different site.\nrequired for desorption, and the big adsorption energy of the\ngas on Pt-WSe 2 also ensures that the gas will be difﬁcult\nto diffuse.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, based on the ﬁrst principle, the adsorption per-\nformance of transformer oil decomposition gas (CO, CH 4 and\nC2H2) on Pt-WSe 2 was theoretically studied in the Dmol 3\nframework by material studio. The typical dimensionally\nlayered transition metal sulﬁde, WSe 2 with Pt atom doping,\nwas predicted to have the potential to act as a gas-sensitive\nmaterial inside the insulating device in the electric power\nﬁeld. The electronic behavior of Pt-WSe 2 before and after\nadsorption was determined by DOS analysis and Mulliken\nanalysis. The conductivity of the Pt-WSe 2 before and after\nadsorption was obtained by frontier orbital analysis. The\nadsorption behaviors and response mechanisms of the three\ngases were analyzed. The main conclusions were as follows:\nIn term of the doping site of Pt metal atom on WSe 2, Pt atom\nis more likely to be doping at the top of W atom, which\nmarked as T W in the paper. In practice experiment, meth-\nods are needed to adopt for preventing Pt Clusters formed\non the surface of WSe 2. The adsorption degrees between\nCO, CH4, C2H2 gas and Pt-WSe2 are different. CO and C 2H2\nstrongly adsorbed on the Pt doped WSe 2, while the adsorption\nof CH 4 is weak. The former two are chemical adsorption,\nwhile the latter is physical adsorption. During the adsorption\nprocess, all three gases transfer electrons to Pt-WSe 2, and the\nthree adsorptions will lead to an increase in the width of band\ngap of the doping material, that is, the increase in resistivity.\nThe corresponding resistivity of the three adsorption systems\nis: CO>CH4 >C2H2.\nREFERENCES\n[1] M.
