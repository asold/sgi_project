  "abstract": "Background: In recent years, there has been remarkable growth in AI-based applications in healthcare, with a significant breakthrough marked by the launch of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. Patients and health professional students commonly utilize these models due to their accessibility. The increasing use of LLMs in healthcare necessitates an evaluation of their ability to generate accurate and reliable responses. Objective: This study assessed the performance of LLMs in answering orthodontic-related queries through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted up to 31 October 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST), and R Studio software (Version 4.4.0) was employed for meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessment. Results: Out of 278 retrieved articles, 10 studies were included. The most commonly used LLM was ChatGPT (10/10, 100% of papers), followed by Google’s Bard/Gemini (3/10, 30% of papers), and Microsoft’s Bing/Copilot AI (2/10, 20% of papers). Accuracy was primarily evaluated using Likert scales, while the DISCERN tool was frequently applied for reliability assessment. The meta-analysis indicated that the LLMs, such as ChatGPT-4 and other models, do not significantly differ in generating responses to queries related to the specialty of orthodontics. The forest plot revealed a Standard Mean Deviation of 0.01 [CI: 0.42–0.44]. No heterogeneity was observed between the experimental group (ChatGPT-3.5, Gemini, and Copilot) and the control group (ChatGPT-4). However, most studies exhibited a high PROBAST risk of bias due to the lack of standardized evaluation tools. Conclusions: ChatGPT-4 has been extensively used for a variety of tasks and has demonstrated advanced and encouraging outcomes compared to other LLMs, and thus can be regarded as a valuable tool for enhancing educational and learning experiences. While LLMs can generate comprehensive responses, their reliability is compromised by the absence of peer-reviewed references, necessitating expert oversight in healthcare applications.",
