Building three-dimensional models from protein sequences is frequently an impor-\ntant step in the antibody design process, enabling researchers to study antibody properties\nsuch as stability, antigenicity, aggregation propensity, solubility, viscosity, and more. In addi-\ntion, when used in combination with protein-protein docking methods, these models can be\nused to understand and predict antibody-antigen interactions.\nHomology modeling is a well-established method, which has been shown to produce quite\naccurate models for a protein sequence if an X-ray structure of a protein with a sufficient\ndegree of sequence similarity is available[3, 4]. The area of antibody design and engineering is\na case for which homology modeling is particularly well suited, because in general the overall\nsequence and structural similarity between antibodies is very high. In particular, the frame-\nwork regions of antibodies are very well conserved, with most of the variability occurring in\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01779 23 May 18, 2017 1 / 26\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\na1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Kemmish H, Fasnacht M, Yan L (2017)\nFully automated antibody structure prediction\nusing BIOVIA tools: Validation study.

This property of antibodies has led to the\ndevelopment of specialized structure prediction methods [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] which have been\nshown to outperform generalist methods [12].\nAntibody structure prediction methods generally follow a two-stage approach. In the first\nstage, an accurate model of the framework regions (i.e. excluding the CDR regions) is con-\nstructed based on appropriate templates [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The framework templates are typ-\nically selected based on sequence similarity from a curated database of antibody structures.\nModels are then built either based on a single template for the whole structure [5, 7] or sepa-\nrate templates can be used for the VH and VL chains [5, 6, 10, 11]. In the latter case an addi-\ntional step is required to determine the relative orientation of the chains [5, 6, 11].\nIn the second stage, the hypervariable loop regions of the structure are rebuilt. Five of the\nsix CDR regions typically adopt a limited number of conformations [13] and can in most cases\nbe accurately modeled by grafting the regions from an appropriate template [14]. However, a\nnumber of different approaches are possible for CDR template selection and loop grafting [5,\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nThe H3 loop is more difficult to model because this region exhibits a much larger degree of\nvariation in loop length and conformations adopted. For H3, ab initio loop modeling methods\nhave been shown to increase accuracy compared to template based models in some cases [7, 8,\n9].\nA blind prediction experiment assessing various antibody structure prediction methods\nwas performed in 2009[15]. The results of BIOVIA’s participation in this experiment generally\nvalidated our template-based modeling approach. However, it also identified some deficiencies\nin our modeling process. The lessons learned allowed us to improve our performance in the\nsecond instalment of the Antibody Modeling Assessment (AMA-II), which was executed in\nearly 2013 (http://www.3dabmo d.com) [5, 12].\nBased on the further experience gained from this, we developed a fully automated antibody\nmodeling protocol which can be run through the Discovery Studio [16] graphical user inter-\nface or in batch mode from the command line. This method is very fast, and can be run on\nmultiple processors with coarse grain parallelization. In addition, the protocol can process\ncombined heavy and light chain inputs, matching separate heavy and light chains by name, or\nperforming permutations combining a set of heavy and light chains. These features make it an\nideal solution for structure prediction of multiple sequences. On a standard desktop PC, a sin-\ngle Fv or Fab structure can be predicted in less than 6 minutes; using a server with 30 proces-\nsors predictions for a set of over 150 Fv sequences can be completed within an hour.\nThe fully automated method was initially validated using the sequences from the AMA-II\nexperiments; that study included a diverse set of sequences, but consisted of only eleven tar-\ngets. We designed the current work to extend the validation of our methods to 157 antibody\nsequences for which structures are available, and to analyze the influence of several parameters\nto obtain better understanding of the effect on model quality. This analysis improves the rec-\nommendations we can offer when using our protocol to build antibody structures.\nMaterials and methods\nComputational methodology\nThe automated structure prediction method consists of three stages: Framework template\nselection, framework model construction, and CDR refinement. These are run in succession\nwithout manual intervention after the specification of the initial run parameters.\nFramework template selection. Templates for each target sequence are selected by align-\ning against sequences in the Discovery Studio antibody database using a Hidden Markov\nValidation of antibod y structure prediction tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01779 23 May 18, 2017 2 / 26\nCompeting interests : HK and LY are employed by\nDassault Systèmes Biovia Corp and the study\npertains to a marketed product, Discovery Studio.\nThis does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE\npolicies on sharing data and materials.\nModel [17], and then identifying those with the highest sequence similarity and identity. By\ndefault CDR regions are excluded from consideration but the user may choose to include\nthem. The five best templates are found for the whole Fv or Fab region, and also for each of the\nlight and heavy chains.\nFramework model construction. We evaluated the following framework model construc-\ntion methods implemented in the software:\n1. Single Template: This is the most straightforward approach, in which a model is built based\non a single Fv/Fab framework template. This template, which contains both the light and\nthe heavy chain regions, is selected by sequence similarity from a curated antibody\ndatabase.\n2. Chimeric: This method builds a model based on a chimeric template. This template is\nassembled from separate light and heavy chain templates. A third interface template, con-\ntaining the whole Fv/Fab region, is used to determine the relative spatial orientation of the\nindividual light and heavy templates. The templates are selected from the database by\nsequence similarity for the relevant regions. Note that the light or heavy templates can be\nidentical to the corresponding domain of the interface template.\n3. Top5: This approach builds a model by using up to five Fv/Fab framework templates simul-\ntaneously. The five templates which have the best sequence similarity to the target are iden-\ntified in the database. However, any template with a similarity not within 10% of the best\none are rejected so occasionally fewer than five templates may be used. The models are built\nbased on a multiple sequence alignment of these templates to the target sequence. This is\ndone using the capability of MODELER [18] to construct models based on multiple tem-\nplates by simultaneously optimizing restraints from all of the templates. MODELER uses an\nadditive distance restraint function that peaks at the equivalent distance between atoms in\neach template. The contribution for each template is weighted by local sequence similarity,\nas described in detail in the MODELER paper [18].\nIn each case, one or more models are built using MODELER, and the top model as ranked\nby the MODELER PDF Physical Energy is used for further refinement.\nCDR refinement. The top-ranking framework structure can then have any or all of its\nCDR loops refined. The CDR loops are located using the IMGT [19], Chothia [13, 20, 21],\nHonegger[22] or Kabat [23] numbering schemes.\nLoop templates are identified based on alignment of the target to sequences in the antibody\ndatabase which have identical CDR loop lengths. The templates may be filtered to use those\nwhich have the correct Chothia canonical type if available; the canonical type definitions\n[21] are shown in S1 File. The templates are ranked with a BLOSUM62 similarity score of the\nCDR region plus the stem residues. There is an additional ranking which favors templates that\nhave high scores for the other two CDR loops in the domain. This can be beneficial as the con-\nformation of the three loops may be interdependent. The final ranking is by crystallographic\nresolution. MODELER is used to build one or more new CDR models while keeping the\nframework region intact.\nValidation dataset\nValidation of the method requires predicting the structures of antibodies for which the struc-\ntures have been experimentally determined, but which are not yet present in the template\ndatabase. Therefore, the computations were performed using the templates present in the Dis-\ncovery Studio 4.1 database, while the validation set was created by searching the Protein Data\nValidation of antibod y structure prediction tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01779 23 May 18, 2017 3 / 26\nBank (PDB) [24] for newer antibody structures. Sequences were retained regardless of their\nsimilarity to those in the database because real usage often involves predicting the structures of\na highly similar series of sequences, which may have identical frameworks or loop regions.\nThis yielded an initial set of 249 Fv target sequences. Any structure with missing residues\nwithin the light or heavy chain was excluded. The set was further pruned to 95% sequence\nidentity, choosing representatives with more complete termini and/or having structures with\nbetter crystallographic resolution. This resulted in a validation set of 157 unique Fv sequences.\nThese are listed in S1 Text.\nWhile most of the structures were of good or reasonable crystallographic resolution below\n3.0 Å, 16 were in the range from 3–5 Å and three had been determined by electron microscopy\nwith ‘resolution’ above 13 Å. The deviations between the experimental and predicted models\nfor the electron microscopy structures are as likely to be due to inaccuracies in the deposited\nstructure as in the prediction, so they were excluded from the analysis, leaving 154 structures.\nThe organism classifications of this final set are 75 human, 68 mouse, 5 rabbit, 4 rhesus\nmacaque and 2 chicken antibodies; note however that this includes engineered structures. 125\nhave kappa light chains and 29 have lambda light chains.\nLoop length distributions, using the Chothia definitions, are shown in Fig 1.\nThe vast majority of the target sequences have at least one template in the Discovery Studio\ndatabase with a sequence similarity above 90% for the Fv domain and above 80% for all CDR\nregions except for H3, as is shown by the histograms in Fig 2.\nValidation calculations\nStructures were predicted for the validation set using a variety of the available options:\n• Each of the framework template modeling methods\nFig 1. Length distribu tions for each of the CDR loops.\nhttps://doi.org/10 .1371/journal.p one.0177923. g001\nValidation of antibod y structure prediction tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01779 23 May 18, 2017 4 / 26\n• Building different numbers of models\n• IMGT, Kabat, Honegger and Chothia loop definitions, the latter with or without canonical\nfiltering\nComparison of predicted and experimental models. The predicted models were com-\npared with the experimental X-ray structures using the same methods as were applied in the\nAMA-II assessment [12]. This entailed superimposing each predicted-experimental pair using\nthe β-sheet core, and then calculating RMSDs of the peptide carbonyl atoms for the light and\nheavy chain framework regions and for each of the CDR loops as defined by the Chothia\nscheme. Carbonyl RMSDs are used as they are sensitive to variations such as peptide flips\nwhich are not revealed by the commonly-used C-α RMSDs. In addition, the deviation in tilt\nangle between the light and heavy chain regions was calculated, again using the same method\nFig 2. Distribut ion of sequence similar ity of query sequence to database templates. CDR loops were defined using the Chothia numbering\nscheme .\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371 /journal.pone. 0177923.g002\nValidation of antibod y structure prediction tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01779 23 May 18, 2017 5 / 26\nas for the AMA-II work [5]. The RMSD and tilt angle information, together with details of the\ntemplates used in each prediction, are tabulated in S1 Table.\nFurther analysis. Custom protocols were created in BIOVIA’s Pipeline Pilot to analyze\nand compare the predictions. Many of the results are presented using box plots which are a\ncompact means of displaying the distributions for several sets of data on the same chart. The\nbottom and top of the box are at the first and third quartile respectively, while the line within it\nmarks the median value and a dot marks the mean value. The ‘whiskers’ are calculated by the\nTukey method as 1.5 of the lower and upper quartile ranges. In some plots, any outliers beyond\nthese values are plotted as small squares, and this is the definition of ‘outlier’ used in parts of\nthe discussion. The results obtained by different methods were also assessed using a pairwise t-\ntest, with p values below 0.05 being considered to be statistically significant.\nDetailed analysis was performed within Discovery Studio 4.5, utilizing its sequence align-\nment, structural superimposition and visualisation capabilities.\nResults and discussion\nTemplate based refinement of the CDR loops by homology modeling requires a template with\nidentical loop length. The validation dataset contains 6 sequences in which no template was\navailable for one of the loops using any of the loop definitions, and a further 4 and 5 cases\nrespectively for the Kabat and Honegger definitions. Details can be found in S1 Text. The set\nof 11 predictions using the Honegger definition were examined; the similarities for the best\nframework model were all above 77%. The overall and framework RMSDs for this group ver-\nsus the remainder of the set with framework similarity above 77% were compared. Fig 3 shows\nthat in addition to the unsurprising decrease in accuracy of the overall RMSD, the quality of\nthe framework models is also generally poorer. There are particularly large distortions if long\nFig 3. Effect of missing loop templat es. Framework (FR) and overall (FV) RMSDs for predictions with all\nloops modeled or not.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0177923.g0 03\nValidation of antibod y structure prediction tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01779 23 May 18, 2017 6 / 26\nCDRH3 loops are misplaced. These cases have been excluded from the remaining analyses,\nleaving 148 sequences for the Chothia and IMGT methods.\nFramework models\nThe predictions were run for the sequence set using each of the three framework modeling\nmethods (Single, Chimeric and Top5) with all other conditions the same. Fig 4 is a boxplot for\nthe RMSD of the predicted models versus the experimental structures for the framework (FR)\nand whole Fv region including CDRs (FV), and Table 1 lists the p values which show whether\nthe results are significantly different. These show that the Top5 method yields more accurate\nframework models which result in better models overall, and there is little difference between\nthe Single and Chimeric approaches.\nAs expected, the accuracy of the predicted model depends on the availability of sufficiently\nsimilar templates. Fig 5 shows the framework RMSD and tilt deviation for predictions using\nthe Top5, Chimeric and Single methods. In each case, quite accurate results are generally\nobtained for all similarities above 85% but markedly worse below that, as shown in Table 2.\nAll but four of the validation set do have at least one template in the database with >85%\nsimilarity.\nThe similarity value used for the Top5 plot is that of the highest similarity template avail-\nable, so it is interesting to note that while the similarity of the other four templates used may\nbe lower, the models produced by this method tend to be more accurate than those using just\nthe single best template even for very high similarities.\nThe CDR loops are by default excluded from the similarity and identity calculations used to\nselect the templates for framework modeling. Including them makes no significant difference\nto the overall accuracy of the models, as shown in Fig 6. However, as discussed below, there\nare some sequences for which including the CDRs is beneficial.\nFig 4. Comparis on of framework modeling methods . Framework (FR) and overall (FV) RMSDs (Å) for the\nthree methods.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0177923.g0 04\nValidation of antibod y structure prediction tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01779 23 May 18, 2017 7 / 26\nCDR loop refinement\nThe accuracy of the CDR loop modeling will depend on the quality of the initial framework\nmodel, as shown in Table 3, but also on the similarity of the loop templates. This trend is\nshown in Fig 7.\nIt has been shown in previous studies that the accuracy of the loop models is related to its\nlength [25]. This is particularly relevant in the case of H3.\nHowever, even for quite long loops, reasonable models may be obtained if there is a highly\nsimilar template available. This is illustrated by Fig 8, which is a heat map of the average CDR\nRMSD for each H3 loop length/similarity combination present in the dataset. The Discovery\nStudio 4.1 database provided templates with a similarity above 85% for over a quarter of H3\nloops with lengths greater than 13 (8 out of 29 cases); as the number of structures deposited in\nthe PDB grows this should increase.\nThe predictions were run for the sequence set using the IMGT, Honegger, Kabat, Chothia\nand Chothia with canonical filtering loop definitions, all other parameters being the same. In\nFig 9, while there is some variation, there is no clear overall best choice. Comparing each of the\nother definitions against Chothia, the only statistically significant differences are that the\nframework RMSD and tilt angle deviations are slightly worse using the Kabat definition (p val-\nues 0.05 and 0.03).\nTo examine the effect of different template choices in more detail, we identified the cases\nwhere different sets of templates had been selected by the Chothia definition with and without\nTable 1.

Those which had reasonable framework templates (similarity >85% and\nRMSD < 1.0 Å) and with loop RMSDs differing by more than 0.5 Å were analysed. The pre-\ndicted structures are available in S1 Dataset and S2 Dataset.\nCDR L1. Using the above criteria, in the comparison of canonical filtering against\nthe unfiltered Chothia definition, there were two cases where canonical filtering was better\nthan unfiltered (4LIQ_LH_FV and 4QWW_CD_FV) and one in which it was worse (4K7P_\nLH_FV).\nIn 4LIQ, the choice of the correct kappa kL1:2A canonical for all three templates produces\nthe correct conformation around the Asn30 residue with phi ~ 60˚ and psi ~ -120˚, which is in\na ‘marginal’ region of the Ramachandran plot. Without filtering, two of the selected templates\nare of canonical type kL1:2B which have phi/psi in ‘allowed’ regions but are not correct in this\ncontext. The choice was made on the basis of the scores including the stem regions, which\nTable 2.

The effect, as shown in Fig 10, a plot of backbone\nand C-Beta atoms for the X-ray structure and the two predictions, is quite localised.\n4QWW is rather more complicated. All the templates selected had the correct kL1:1 canoni-\ncal type with or without the canonical filtering. In the case of filtering the templates selected\nwere 4EBQ, 1AY1 and 1YQV. 1AY1 does not adopt the canonical conformation, with the\nSer30 being flipped, however the predicted conformation was closer to the other two. The\nunfiltered prediction chose 4EBQ, 1AY1 and 3C09; the latter has better similarity than 1YQV\nbut lower resolution. While its conformation is broadly similar to that of 4EBQ and 1YQV,\nfavourable interactions with the L3 loop cause it to be displaced. The net result is that the pre-\ndicted model tends towards the incorrect conformation of 1AY1.\nThe L1 loop of 4K7P is canonical kL1:2A. The templates of this type selected using filtering\nare 1MQK, 1F6L and 3V7A. However, the latter is flipped at Tyr30 relative to the other two;\nTable 3.

The templates chosen without canonical filtering are 1F6L,\n2FR4, 1P7K. This set has a high ranking because they are also high scoring templates for the L2\nand L3 loops. 2FR4 and 1P7K do not belong to any canonical type, but differ from type kL1:2A\nonly in having a leucine rather than isoleucine at residue position 2 and adopt similar confor-\nmations to 1F6L.\nFig 8.

For the L2 loop, 4JO4_LH, which is one of the rabbit sequences, has canonical\ntype kL2:1. With canonical filtering, the selected templates are 2CMR, 1LK3 and 1OP3. With-\nout filtering, the latter is replaced by 1DFB. All templates are of the correct canonical type and\nhave 100% identity. The conformations are all correct except for some deviation at residue 52\nfor 1DFB, which does not explain well why the predicted loop is flipped at the 50–51 peptide\nFig 9.

Examination of a run in which 50 models were generated for each loop shows that this\nis an anomalous result, with only three of the models adopting the flipped conformation rela-\ntive to the templates. This is shown in Fig 11A.\nConversely, in the case of 4C83_BA, accurate results are produced by the unfiltered method\nbut there is a flip of the 50–51 peptide bond for the model obtained with filtering. The L2 loop\nof 4C83 is of type kL2:1 and the canonically-filtered templates are 2W9D, 4F33 and 4I9W.\nWithout filtering, the latter is replaced by 3NCY which is also of the correct canonical type. As\nbefore, all the templates are in the correct canonical conformation and are 100% identical.\nExamination of a run with canonical filtering generating 50 models again shows that most do\nadopt the same conformation as the template but three are flipped. This is shown in Fig 11B.\nSo, it seems that the differences in these cases are not really due to the method of choosing the\ntemplates but are an artefact of model building.\n4JG1_LH is a case in which canonical filtering yielded a poor set of templates. The canoni-\ncal type is kL2:1, which requires isoleucine or valine at residue 48 and glycine at 64 The tem-\nplates matching this type which were selected were 4D9Q, with a similarity and identity of\n67%, while the other two, 2ADF and 1FJ1, had no similarity at all for the three loop residues.\nThis pair adopted the conformation typical for the canonical whereas 4D9Q did not. Without\nfiltering, the three templates selected (3BQU, 1I8K and 3I9G) had similarities of 100% with\ntwo being 100% identical. This set of templates had similar conformation to 4D9Q and cor-\nrectly modelled the loop. However, they differed from the canonical definition by having a ser-\nine instead of glycine at residue 64. These are shown in Fig 12 together with some examples of\ntypical kL2:1 canonical loops for comparison.\nCDR L3. There were no cases found where the RMSD for the L3 loop differed by more\nthan 0.5Å between the filtered and unfiltered templates.\nCDR H1. 4M5Y_LH benefits from canonical filtering, by selecting templates 3CX5, 4HC1\nand 2XA8 which are all of the correct canonical type, H1:2. The templates have reasonable sim-\nilarity and identity to the target, and adopt the same conformation. Without filtering, the first\ntwo of these are selected but the highest ranked template is 2XZC, which has a very high score\nbecause of high identity of the loop and stem regions. But it does not conform to any canonical\ntype and adopts a different conformation which dominates the prediction.\nIn the case of 4O02_LH, all the selected templates were of canonical type H1:1 and had\n100% similarity, 71.4% identity and a score of 89. They were 1WT4 in both cases, plus 3CMO\nFig 11. Predicted CDR L2 loop and templat es for 4JO4 and 4C83.

The unfiltered selection, which includes in its ranking criteria the\nscores of the other two loop regions, chose 1A6V_I and 1A6V_J. All the templates had the\ncorrect canonical conformation except for 1A6V_J, which differed at residues 29–30; the pre-\ndicted model was similar to this. 1AV6 is a structure which contains three non-crystallographi-\ncally related copies demonstrating the variability in conformation which can arise due to\npacking. Comparing the loops, the main-chain RMSDs are between 1–1.7Å for H1, 1.3–1.8Å\nfor H2 and 1.1–1.5Å for H3.\n4LEO_BA has a >0.5Å worse RMSD for the H1 loop for the prediction using canonical fil-\ntering versus unfiltered Chothia, but neither is very accurate (1.7Å and 1.2Å). The templates\n(3EO0_B and 1MJ8_H for both, plus 1MH5_B with filtering and 2UYL_B without) all had\nsimilarity/identity of 71%; this is relatively low compared to most of the other cases.\nCDR H2. 4NKI_LH is a case where using canonical filtering yielded a much better result\nfor H2 versus the unfiltered Chothia definition (RMSD for the loop residues 0.4Å vs 2.4Å).\nThe target sequence has canonical type H2:3. With filtering, the selected templates were\n3HI6_H, 3HI5_H and 3KYM_B (Fig 13A), whereas without filtering the templates chosen\nwere 3HI6_H and 3K2U_H, 2WUC_H, the last two of which are canonical H2:2 (Fig 13B).\nThe reason for this choice was that they have slightly better scores for the loop region including\nthe stems; however they adopt a significantly different conformation especially at Pro52A.\nIn 4G80_BA, the canonical type is H2:2, and the templates chosen using filtering are\n1NJ9_B, 3EFD_H and 3IVK_A. The latter adopts an anomalous conformation at Pro52A but\nthe prediction is closer to the other two; this produces a good fit, with a loop RMSD of 0.66Å.\nWithout filtering, the templates are again 1NJ9_B, 3IVK_A and the H2:3 canonical 1SEQ_H.\nIn addition to being the wrong canonical type, 1SEQ_H also has similarity/identity of only\n25% but has a better score including stem regions than 3EFD. It has a drastically different con-\nformation and the resulting prediction, having only one template with a typical canonical con-\nformation, is inaccurate with a loop RMSD of 1.56Å.\nFig 12. 4JG1 L2 loop.

Running a prediction on just the sequences clas-\nsified as human, with canonical filtering and specifying the organism as ‘human’, 47 sequences\nhad at least one loop with no templates found, of which 23 had no loops matched and so no\nmodel created. Predictions on the sequences classified as mouse with filtering by organism\n‘mouse’ resulted in 37 cases where at least one loop could not be modelled. Combining the\nresults for which all loops were predicted using organism filtering and comparing against the\nprediction with no organism filtering showed little overall difference, with some loop types\nbeing rather worse with the filtering. So in general it does not appear to be beneficial to use\nthis option. It should be noted that the taxonomic classification will not be correct in the case\nof engineered antibodies, as one or more loops may not derive from the organism of the rest of\nthe structure.\nEffect of number of cycles of refinement\nThe predictions were run to generate N framework models using the Top5 method, and then\nfor the best of these, N loop models using the Chothia definition, for N = 1, 10, 25 and 50. Fig\n14 shows that very little difference can be seen between the overall results for the framework or\nloop regions. There is a slight improvement for the framework and loop regions except for H3\non increasing from 1 model to 10, but little change thereafter. The differences are only statisti-\ncally significant for the framework region and loops L2 and H2, and probably not large enough\nto be meaningful in practice.\nExamination of outliers\nIn order to understand factors affecting the accuracy of the predicted structures, outliers were\nexamined to see what might be giving rise to unusually large discrepancies from the X-ray\nstructures in a small subset of cases. As is clear from Fig 5, a major consideration is whether\nhigh similarity templates are available in the database. To account for this, the analysis was per-\nformed considering only those for which there was an overall Fv template with similarity\nabove 85%. In addition, cases without loop templates of the correct length are also likely to be\nFig 13. 4NKI_LH H2 loop.

The predictions generated\nusing the Top5 framework template method and Chothia loop numbering were used for the\nanalysis; these structures are available in S1 Dataset.\nFramework region. Fig 15A shows that the framework RMSD for 75% of the predicted\nstructures is within 0.9Å of the experimental structure, with a median value of 0.7Å and all\nbelow 1.5Å. The four outliers with RMSDs above 1.3Å are listed in Table 4: 3ZL4_LH (1.5Å),\n4QHM (1.5Å), 4LVH_CB (1.4Å), 4QHM (1.5Å) and 4MWF_LH (1.4Å). Fig 15B shows that\nthe tilt angle deviations are generally quite low, with 75% falling below 6˚. There are five outli-\ners with angles above 9˚ shown in Table 5: 3ZL4_LH (15.6˚), 4CNI_BA (13˚), 4NIK_BB\n(11.4˚), 4MWF_LH (10.0˚) and 4FZE_LH (9.9˚). Unsurprisingly, some structures are outliers\nfor both RMSD and tilt deviation.\nFig 14. Effect of number of cycles of refinemen t. Box plots showing variatio n in framework and loop RMSDs for different number s of framew ork\nmodels and CDR refinemen t cycles.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0177923.g0 14\nValidation of antibod y structure prediction tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01779 23 May 18, 2017 16 / 26\nThe best ranked template for 3ZL4_LH is 2XZC_LH. The sequences of the Fv regions have\na very high identity, differing only in the last four residues of the L chain and one near the end\nof the H chain. Superimposing the X-ray structure onto this template and calculating the\nframework RMSD gives a value of 1.7Å, similar to the discrepancy in the predicted model.\nHowever, examination of the full sequence shows that the light chain of 3ZL4 has lambda vari-\nable and constant domains, whereas in 2XZC there is a kappa constant domain[26]. The struc-\nture was engineered in order to investigate the effect of switching between kappa and lambda\nconstant domains on the structure and functionality of the antibody; this was found to cause a\n12˚ change in the elbow angle. If the structure of the full Fab domain is predicted, all of the\ntemplates used for the framework model have a lambda constant domain and the RMSD for\nthe framework of the Fv region of this structure falls to within 1.1Å of the X-ray structure.\nExamining 4LVH_CB, the discrepancies in the framework lie mainly at the N-termini of\nthe L and H chains, which appear to be misaligned by one residue. The misalignment in the L\nchain occurs around Pro8, which is in the trans form in the X-ray structure but adopts the cis\nconformation in the predicted model. The most similar template has a trans Pro8 but the other\nfour are cis. In the case of the H chain, the discrepancy arises in the region before Gly8, Gly9\nand Gly10. This highly flexible region allows for variation in the templates which is reflected in\nthe model structure. An examination of the experimental structure for violations shows that\nthere are 45 non-planar peptide bonds whereas there are none in the predicted structure; com-\nparison of Ramachandran plots similarly shows fewer violations in the predicted structure. It\nis unsurprising that a modeled structure does not replicate these violations.\nIn 4QHM_BA, the most obvious structural difference is in the turn between Gln39 and\nLeu45 of the heavy chain. Examining the relationship to the templates, it is evident that while\nthe overall similarity to the target is within 10% of that of the best template, the discrepancy is\ngreater if the CDR regions are also considered. This is shown in Table 6. In this case the inclu-\nsion of the lower-similarity templates appears to be leading to sub-optimal modeling of some\nregions; the single template method yields a lower framework RMSD (1.0Å). However, the\noverall RMSDs for the models produced by the two methods are very similar (1.49Å and\n1.42Å). Better results (framework RMSD 1.0Å, overall RMSD 1.1Å) are obtained in this case\nFig 15. RMSD and tilt angle deviation for predic tions with good templates available.\nhttps://d oi.org/10.1371/j ournal.pon e.0177923.g0 15\nValidation of antibod y structure prediction tools\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.or g/10.137 1/journal.po ne.01779 23 May 18, 2017 17 / 26\nby not excluding the CDR regions from the similarity and identity calculation; the top 5 overall\ntemplates are still the same but only the first two are used as the similarities of the others are\nover 10% poorer.\n4MWF_LH is an outlier both for RMSD and tilt angle deviation. The H3 loop is 16 residues\nlong and includes a disulfide bridge. It adopts a significantly different conformation from the\nH3 loops used to build the framework model, and even more different from any of the tem-\nplates used for CDR modeling, which only have similarities of 25–31%. It is likely that this\nlarge discrepancy in the final loop conformation causes the inaccurate orientation of the\ndomains.\n4CNI_BA and 4FZE_LH may be outliers for tilt angle because they adopt VL-VH orienta-\ntions towards the extremes of the distributions found using the ABangle webserver [27] for at\nleast one of its measures. In the case of 4FZE, this is particularly marked for the HL angle,\nwhereas for the template 4JZO (which is used twice as it exists in two slightly different forms\nin the crystal structure) this angle lies towards the other extreme. Using the single template\nmethod for framework prediction with the template 3MA9 yields a much more accurate struc-\nture with tilt deviation 3.7˚, framework RMSD 0.6Å and overall RMSD 1.5Å.\nLoop regions. The loop regions were examined in a similar way to identify factors other\nthan template similarity which could adversely affect accuracy. This part of the analysis was\ntherefore further restricted to the cases for which the loop being investigated had at least one\ntemplate with similarity above 85%. The RMSD ranges for these are shown in Table 7 and Fig\n16.\nCDR L1. In the L1 outliers shown in Table 8, the deviation in 4HIE_AB arises from the\ntemplates having a significantly different conformation for residues 30 and 31. These residues\nare SS in all the templates but TN in the target sequence. The Ser30 residues of the templates\nhave backbone angles which are not in the allowed region of a Ramachandran map. This con-\nformation may be stabilised by non-bonded interactions e.g. a hydrogen bond between Ser31\nand Asp50 and Tyr32 whereas the Asn31 makes completely different interactions with Arg91,\nAsp92, and Phe100A.\n4NIK_BB is another example of a fairly long loop (11 residues) containing 3 glycines;\nalthough the sequences are identical, there is a high degree of variability in the loop conforma-\ntion of the template and target crystal structures.\nTable 4.

The outlying L2 loops are listed in Table 9; note that while there seem to be a\nlarge number of them, the median and 75 percentiles are lower than for other loops. The L2\nloops are typically very short using the Chothia and IMGT definitions, so the cases with outly-\ning RMSDs are likely to arise from misalignments in the stem region. This is the case for\n4O02_LH in which the loop is defined as residues 50–52 and the RMSD (which is calculated\nfor 50–53) is 2.5Å for Chothia and similar for IMGT. The framework templates deviate from\neach other at residue 53, which results in the prediction similarly deviating from the experi-\nmental structure. It is worth noting that the values for Kabat which extends the loop to 7 resi-\ndues and Honegger which has 12, the RMSDs are 0.8Å and 1.0Å respectively; the framework\ntemplates align better and so the loop can also be placed more correctly.\nIn the case of 4K7P_XY, the discrepancy occurs because the target sequence has a proline at\nresidue 51 of the loop region which adopts the cis conformation in the crystal structure. How-\never, none of the framework templates has a proline in this position and so are all in the trans\nconfiguration; of the CDR templates, only one has proline and it too is trans. Even if the CDR\nregions are included in the framework template similarity, only one has a Pro51 and it is not in\nthe cis conformation.\n4U1G_CB is a case where the predicted and experimental loops appear reasonably similar\nbut both have main chain torsion angles which are not in the allowed regions of a Ramachan-\ndran plot–but for different residues. This leads to different placement of the carbonyl group\nand sidechains in the loop. The distortions in the PDB structure of 4U1G_CB are quite\nextreme. None of the CDR templates adopt its unusual main-chain conformation at Tyr50\n(although the tyrosine ring is in a similar position) so it seemed possible that this loop was\nincorrectly placed in the crystal structure. Therefore, the re-refined structure from pdb_redo\n(http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/pdb_redo/ ) was examined; this was closer to the predicted structure,\nwith an RMSD for the loop of 1.0Å.\nCDR L3. The outliers for CDR L3 are shown in Table 10. The L3 loop of 4QHK_NM has\nan RMSD of 3.6Å. The difference between the prediction and the crystal structure arises from\nthe presence in the latter of two non-proline cis-peptides in the loop, Asp92-Ser93 and Phe94--\nSer95. In addition, most of the main-chain angles are in unfavourable regions of a Ramachan-\ndran map, shown in Fig 17A. There are no cis-peptides in any of the framework or CDR\ntemplates used to model this structure and fewer main-chain violations in the prediction, as\nshown in Fig 17B. It seems to be a case in which the prediction is plausible but the experimen-\ntal structure is in an unexpected conformation.\nTable 6.

Table 11 lists the outliers for the CDR H1 loop. The predicted H1 loop of\n4NNP_LH deviates significantly from the observed structure. Examining against the frame-\nwork templates, the difference in the region around Ser31 may be due to interactions between\nthe H1 and H3 loops–the latter is 17 residues long in the target structure whereas that of the\ntemplates are only 7 or 10 and adopt a quite different conformation. In all cases there are\nhydrogen bonds between the two loops. There is no obvious reason for the marked difference\nat Gly26; the flexibility of this residue presumably allows the remainder of the loop to adopt a\ndifferent conformation as the result of crystal packing.\nCDR H2. Table 12 lists the outliers for the CDR H2 loop. 4OGY_LH is an outlier for both\nthe H1 and H2 regions. The framework templates show good agreement to the X-ray structure\nfor both the H1 and H2 stem regions. For the H1 loop, the templates all adopt a similar confor-\nmation to each other but differ from the target X-ray structure; again, there is a Gly26 residue.\nThe H2 loops all have Gly54 and Gly55. In fact, of the outlying H1 and H2 loops, all but one\ncontains one or more glycine residues.\n4NKI_LH is the case where using canonical filtering will yield a much better result for H2\nas discussed in detail in the Comparison of Loop Definitions section.\nCDR H3. The H3 loops show much more variability than the others, as is expected. Exam-\nining the one outlying case 4LLV_LH, which is shown in Table 13, it is noted that the crystal\nstructure contains other non-crystallographically related heavy chains. Comparing their H3\nFig 16.

The loop templates have very high identity with the target sequence (2FX7 is\nidentical, the other two only differ by one residue) and all adopt a very similar conformation\nto the predicted model. It seems likely that the conformation is driven by the local packing\nenvironment in the crystal, which is markedly different between 4LLV and 2FX7, and could\nwell be quite different in a non-crystalline environment.\nConclusions\nIn general, the automated antibody structure prediction can produce models with quite accu-\nrate framework regions (RMSD typically below 0.9Å and tilt angle deviation below 6˚) and\nreasonable CDR loops for all but H3, as shown in Table 7. The Top5 framework method\nproduces small but significant improvements in model accuracy, but the predictions are not\nparticularly sensitive to the other parameters. Of the various combinations of parameters\nexamined, the best overall results were obtained using the Chothia scheme with canonical fil-\ntering, with 5 CDR templates and 10 CDR models generated, and using the default values for\nother settings. While the differences between the various sets of results obtained using the\nTop5 framework method and varying other parameters are statistically insignificant, the use of\nmore templates and the generation of more models can be helpful in some cases. The predic-\ntions using these parameters are available in S3 Dataset.\nTable 8.

The number of such templates continues to grow steadily;\nwhereas the database used for this validation contained a total of 4950 non-redundant domain\nsequences, the latest Discovery Studio 2016 release has 6981. Tools are also provided which\nallow a user to update the database to include new entries as they are added to the PDB and/or\ntheir own proprietary structures.\nIn cases where there is no template available for a loop, the prediction should be viewed\nwith scepticism. It may be possible to improve the prediction method to reduce the impact of\nmissing templates in future.\nThe method is quick, as it is generally not necessary to build multiple structures or perform\nlong refinement cycles to generate good models. However, the analysis of template choices\nsuggests that loop modeling may sometimes benefit from the use of more than three templates\nto reduce the impact of a template with an anomalous conformation, and that it could be use-\nful to generate multiple loop models and discard those belonging to minor clusters.\nWhile the use of canonical filtering will in many cases choose appropriate templates, this\nneeds to be balanced against other factors in particular the sequence similarity of the loop\nitself, as shown in the case of 4JG1. Some of the canonical definitions including kL1:2A and\nkL2:1 may be overly restrictive in the specificity of residues required at certain positions; these\nshould be reviewed\nTable 10.

A possible\nimprovement to the method would be to check that all the framework templates derived from\nstructures with the appropriate constant domain type.\nThe positioning of the N-terminal section of the chains may be particularly sensitive to the\nconformational differences which may be present in the templates due to the commonly-\nfound proline in the L-chain or adjacent glycine residues in the H chain.\nLong loops can show considerable variation for different chains within the same crystal\nstructure. It seems likely that, especially for long loops which contain glycine residues, the con-\nformation observed in a particular crystal environment may not necessarily be more ‘correct’\nthan another. The analysis of other loops indicates that quite subtle changes in the chemistry\ncan lead to different non-bonded interactions and hence loop conformations.\nThe presence of cis-peptides either in templates when not found in the X-ray structure or\nvice-versa can lead to discrepancies. While a non-proline cis-peptide arising in a prediction as\nTable 11.
