INTRODUCTION\nThe safe and stable operation of power system is important for\npeople’s daily life. As one of the transfer station, transformers\nhas been widely used in power systems. The reliability and\nperformance of transformers play a crucial role in the normal\noperation of power system [1], [2]. Therefore, in the process\nof power system operation and maintenance, how to identify\nand locate the internal fault of transformer efﬁciently, timely\nand accurately is great signiﬁcance to the stable operation of\nthe power system.\nAt present, methods for transformer fault detection are pro-\nposed mainly based on the characteristic signal of transformer\nstatus. They can be divided into many classes, including the\nchromatographic technique [3], [4], the infrared spectrum\ntechnology [5], the sensor array online detection technology\nand transformer oil temperature detection technology [6], and\nso on. With the development of artiﬁcial intelligence technol-\nogy, many artiﬁcial intelligent comprehensive fault diagnosis\nmethods have been presented based on neural network [7],\nexpert system [8], support vector machine [9], frequency\nThe associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and\napproving it for publication was Okyay Kaynak\n.\nresponse analysis [10], etc. However, the above methods are\nindirect fault diagnosis, which cannot provide an accurate\nfault location. To solve this problem, all transformer oil\nshould be completely drained and the maintenance personnel\nshould enter the transformer during each inspection. How-\never, manual inspection method has many problems, such as\nhigh risk, low efﬁciency, and secondary pollution.\nIn 2018, ABB ﬁrstly introduced the oil-immersed trans-\nformer internal inspection robot, which is named TXplore\nrobot [11], [12]. The TXplore robot is equipped with multiple\ncameras. The shape of the robot is rectangular with size of\n18∗20∗24cm. TXplore robot is derived by four propellers,\nwhich are the common driving method of Autonomous\nUnderwater Vehicle (AUV). Therefore, it can complete\nthe internal inspection of the transformer structure without\nreleasing the oil. However, when the propeller rotates at high\nspeed, it is easy to generate bubbles that reduce dielectric\nstrength of transformer oil [13]. In addition, the turn radius\nof TXplore Robot is big, which is difﬁcult for the robot to\nmove ﬂexibly inside the transformer.\nThere has been less research on robot working in\ntransformer oil. In the design of the robot, we refer to\nthe underwater vehicles that play crucial roles in different\nVOLUME 8, 2020 This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

Fenget al.: Hovering Control of Submersible Transformer Inspection Robot Based on ASMBC Method\napplication areas [14]. Speciﬁc applications include marine\nresource exploration, national security, and search and res-\ncue in hazardous environments. Different applications or\ntasks require different shapes, sizes and conﬁgurations of\nAUVs. However, these conventional AUVs are not able to\ncarry out detailed inspection tasks at zero or slow forward\nspeeds in a narrow space [15]. Therefore, numerous schol-\nars have carried out research on underwater robots with\nspherical structures. An autonomous underwater spherical\nrobot ODIN with six degree of freedom has been designed\nat the University of Hawaii [16]. For testing various kinds\nof algorithms, Choi H.T. et al proposed a spherical AUV\nnamed ODINIII with eight thrusters, which could provide\ninstantaneous and omnidirectional prowess [17]. A new-\ntype spherical underwater vehicle BYSQ-2 was provided in\npaper [18]. BYSQ-2 could complete 6 degrees of freedom\n(6-DOF) movement by a thruster and a steering gear with\na dual drive. Based on the motion analysis, the dynamics\nmodel of BYQ-3 spherical robot was established by Kane\nequation modeling method [19]. A ﬁnite-time stabilization\ncontroller was put forward for BYQ-3, which could ensure\nrobot stated converge to zero in ﬁnite time [20]. In order to\nstudy the motion performance of a spherical robot based on\nvectored water-jet propulsion system, Yue C. et al designed\na spherical underwater robot (SURII) with complex water-jet\npropulsion system [21]. The propulsion system included three\nwater-jet thrusters and six servomotors. A novel propulsion\nsystem for SURIII was devised [22]. The experiment results\ndemonstrate the propulsive force of the propulsion system\nis better than SURII. The Eyeball ROV has been designed\nin paper [23], which can move in any direction by a pair of\nthrusters. Considering the complex of underwater spherical\nrobot, a neural network-based auto-turning control system\nwas designed. The neural network can automatically estimate\nthe suitable set of control gains [24].\nIt is difﬁcult problem for AUV to hover at zero speeds.\nVarious methods have been advanced for hovering of AUV.\nSteenson L. V. designed a hover-capable AUV with four\nthrough-body tunnel thrusters and a rear propeller. A PI-D\nbased control system was developed to enable a smooth tran-\nsition from hover-style to ﬂight-style operation of AUV [15].\nVarying the vehicle buoyancy and attitude was used to control\nthe depth of AUV [16]. In order to improve the depth tracking\ncontrol performance of under actuated AUV, an adaptive\nbackstepping controller based on a nonlinear disturbance\nobserver was proposed [27].\nWe refer to structure of underwater robot in paper [17], [21],\nand design a new spherical submersible transformer inspec-\ntion robot (SSTIR) with six oil-jet thrusters in this paper. The\nSSTIR has a small size, zero turn radius and can achieve\n4 degrees of freedom movement in the transformer oil.\nAlthough the SSTIR is ﬁtted with two oil-jet thrusters in\nthe vertical plane, the oil-jet thrusters provide only force\non the robot in the downward direction. The SSTIR should\nhave slightly positively buoyant, allowing the vehicle to move\nin the upward direction. Moreover, the SSTIR can ﬂoat to\nthe oil surface in the event system failure. If the SSTIR\nhovers in the transformer oil, two oil-jet thrusters in vertical\nplane work all the time to overcome the positive buoyancy.\nDue to the robot with spherical hull, the oil resistance is\nvery small in the yaw direction. The environmental distur-\nbance from two oil-jet thrusters working will cause the robot\nyawing motion. Therefore, it is a difﬁcult problem for the\nunder-actuated spherical robot to realize hovering control for\nidentifying transformer fault points. In order to solve this\nproblem, the dynamic model for the robot is obtained by the\nhydrodynamic theory. Afterwards, the cascade control system\nis put forward for hover-style operation of the robot. The\ncascade control system includes the depth control and the yaw\ncontrol. An adaptive sliding mode backstepping controller\nbased on self-learning is developed for the depth control.\nThe self-learning controller is used to counteract the positive\nbuoyancy of the SSTIR, which can reduce the setting time\nof the adaptive sliding mode backstepping controller. And\nan adaptive sliding mode backstepping controller is designed\nfor the heading control. Since the environmental disturbance\nfrom the depth control is time-varying, an adaptive sliding\nmode backsteeping controller can adjust control parameters\nto adapt to environmental disturbance.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II,\nthe mechanical structure of transformer is described.\nIn Section III, the mechanical structure and control system\nof robot are designed. Section IV gives the dynamic model\nand kinematics equations of the SSTIR. Section V demon-\nstrates the hovering control method of the SSTIR. A series of\nexperiments are used to illustrate the feasibility of the SSTIR\nin section VI and VII. Finally, some conclusions are made in\nSection VIII.\nII. STRUCTURE OF OIL-IMMERSED TRANSFORMER\nIn order to design the robot, we need to understand the\nstructure of oil-immersed transformer. The structure of three-\nphase transformer (510cm×230cm×350cm) mainly consists\nof oil tank, core, winding, bushing, cooler, manhole, and con-\nservator, as shown in Fig. 1 [28]. There are a large number of\nlock nuts, screws and cables in the oil-immersed transformer,\nwhich may interfere with the robot motion. The oil tank is\nﬁlled with the 25# transformer oil that is mainly used for\ninsulation, heat dissipation and arc extinction.\nThe top view of the oil-immersed transformer is shown\nin Fig. 2. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the core and winding\nare located in the center of the oil tank, and the shortest\ndistance between the winding and the inner wall of oil tank is\nonly 25cm. Therefore, the maximum size of the robot should\nbe less than 25cm. Manhole with 40cm diameter is located\non the top of the transformer. The robot enters the trans-\nformer through the manhole. The dashed red line indicates\nthe observation track of the robot inside the transformer. The\nrobot detects winding faults along the red track at different\ndepths. LA, LB, and LC represent LV bushing, HA, HB, and\nHC represent HV bushing.\n76288 VOLUME 8, 2020\nY. Fenget al.: Hovering Control of Submersible Transformer Inspection Robot Based on ASMBC Method\nFIGURE 1. Photograph of three-phase oil-immersed transformer.\nFIGURE 2. Top view of the oil-immersed transformer.\nBased on the above analysis, the following factors need to\nbe considered for designing the robot:\n(i) The oil tank is ﬁlled with the 25# transformer oil, so the\nrobot should be protected from transformer oil corrosion.\n(ii) The narrow and complex transformer internal structure\nrequires the robot to have ﬂexible motion.\n(iii) The dynamic model of robot in transformer oil needs\nto be analyzed.\nIII. THE SSTIR SYSTEM DESIGN\nA. MECHANICAL DESIGN OF THE SSTIR\nBecause the working environment of the SSTIR is different\nfrom the previous AUV, mechanical structure of the SSTIR\ndiffers from previous spherical AUV. There are various ways\nto design robot structure, which are typically speciﬁc to the\ntask and environment. According to robot task and envi-\nronment, we give some mechanical design considerations,\nrequired pressure or depth, operating temperature range, size\nrequirements, transformer oil corrosion.\n1) STRUCTURE OF THE SSTIR\nThe height of 220kV oil-immersed transformer is generally\nless than 5 m. The SSTIR hull should bear the pressure at\na transformer oil depth of at least 5 m. The temperature\nof transformer oil can reach 70-80 degree Celsius during\ntransformer operation. Therefore, when the robot performs\nfault detection task the transformer must stop working. The\nFIGURE 3. Outline structure of robot.\nworking temperature of the SSTIR is about 0-40 degree Cel-\nsius. The subsection II gives that the narrowest space inside\nthe transformer is only 25cm. The SSTIR is 19cm in diameter,\nand can pass through the narrowest space.\nThe spherical structure has the two advantages: zero turn-\ning radius, ﬂexible movement. To guarantee the robot can\nmove in the narrow space ﬁlled with transformer oil, the robot\nis designed with a completely closed spherical structure.\nThe SSTIR hull consists of Lidar hull, Upper hull, Bottom\nhull and central ring, as show in Fig. 3. The four parts are\nconnected with waterproof hermetic O-rings. The Lidar hull,\nUpper hull and Bottom hull are made of polycarbonate, which\nhas good resistance to transformer oil corrosion [29]. The\ncentral ring is made of 6061 aluminum alloy, which is resis-\ntant to transformer oil corrosion and helpful for the internal\nheat exchanging.\n2) PROPULSION SYSTEM OF THE SSTIR\nThe blade thruster with excellent performance is widely used\nin propulsion system of AUV [30]. However, it is well known\nthat the blade thruster will generate bubbles at high speed\nrotating. A lot of bubbles will reduce dielectric strength of\ntransformer oil [13]. Consequently, we adopt oil-jet thruster\nfor the propulsion system of the SSTIR. In order to ensure that\nthe robot has the ability to move ﬂexibly in multiple degrees\nof freedom (MDOF), four oil-jet thrusters are designed in\nthe central ring of the robot. Eight holes were cut into the\ncentral ring for the thruster inlet and outlet nozzles. The\noil-jet thruster is directly connected inlet and outlet nozzles,\nand the O-ring sealing is pressed between the end faces of\nthe ﬂange and central ring, as shown in Fig. 4. The oil-jet\nthruster arrangement enables the robot to move with 3 DOF\nincluding yaw motion, surge motion and sway motion. Two\noil-jet thrusters are designed in the vertical plane to enable\nthe robot in heave motion. Since the oil-jet thruster cannot\nchange injection direction, the vertical oil-jet thruster need\nto be closed while the robot moves in upward direction by\npositive buoyancy. The propulsion system layout is shown\nin Fig. 5.\nVOLUME 8, 2020 76289\nY. Fenget al.: Hovering Control of Submersible Transformer Inspection Robot Based on ASMBC Method\nFIGURE 4. Oil-jet thruster seal structure.\nFIGURE 5. Propulsion system layout.\nFIGURE 6. Control circuit of the SSTIR.\nB. THE SSTIR CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN\n1) STRUCTURE OF CONTROL SYSTEM\nThe hardware architecture of the SSTIR control system is\nshown in Fig. 6, including observation and communication\nsystem, motion control system, and data acquisition system.\nRS232 is used for data transmission between different sys-\ntems. The observation and communication system consists\nof HD camera, Lidar and Wireless communication mod-\nule. Wireless communication protects robot movement from\ncommunication cable. The SSTIR can move more ﬂexibly.\nMoreover, the Lidar provides the horizontal position of the\nrobot inside the transformer and detects the obstacle around\nthe robot. HD camera is used to observe faults. The com-\nmunication module can simultaneously transmit HD camera,\nLidar data and control command to robot remote control\nFIGURE 7. Software system of the SSTIR.\nsystem. The motion control system consists of micropro-\ncessor unit (MSP430F147), driver board and oil-jet thruster.\nThe motion control system realizes instruction transmission,\ncontrol algorithm, thrust allocation. Analog voltage signals is\nused for propeller speed to adjust the propulsive forces of the\nthrusters. MSP430F147 provides six analog voltage channels,\nwhich are used to control six oil-jet thrusters separately.\nThe data acquisition system consists of microprocessor unit\n(MSP430F449), Single-axis ﬁber optic gyroscope (Single-\naxis FOG), attitude and heading reference system (AHRS),\ndepth gauge, thermometer, and voltage sensor. The interfaces\nbetween the MSP430F449 and those sensors are shown in\nthe Fig. 5. The MSP430F449 receives depth from the depth\ngauge, yaw angle from Single-aix FOG, attitude information\nfrom AHRS, temperature in the hull from thermometer, bat-\ntery level from voltage sensor.\n2) SOFTWARE SYSTEM DESIGN\nSince IAR 5.4.2 soft development environment gives com-\nprehensive group of software tools and functional libraries for\ndata acquisition, presentation and analysis [31], which is used\nfor programming for the robot control system. According to\nthe robot control circuit, the robot software is divided into two\nparts, control program of MSP430F147 and control program\nof MSP430F449.\nAs shown in Fig. 7, the software architecture of MSP-\n430F147 contains of the communication program, control\nalgorithm, thrust allocation, and force Commands. The com-\nmunication program receives target commands from wireless\ncommunication module, the robot state from MSP430F449,\nand sends various parameters that are needed by control\nalgorithm. Target commands cover expected velocity, depth,\nand yaw angle of robot. Robot states include depth and yaw\nangles of the robot in real time, the battery level, temperature\n76290 VOLUME 8, 2020\nY.

In accordance with preset expected\nvalues and real-time data from sensors of robot, the control\nalgorithm calculates the required force to control robot. The\ncontrol algorithm is the most substantial section of the control\nsystem. The thrust allocation produces analog voltage signals\nand enable signal of oil-jet thruster by the required force from\ncontrol algorithm. The analog voltage signal is used to control\nthe speed of oil-jet thruster and robot motion. Sensors mea-\nsure various parameters of the robot motion, which includes\nrobot attitude, depth, and so on. The software architecture of\nMSP430F449 contains of the communication program, robot\nself-diagnosis, data collection and attitude estimation. The\ncommunication program sends robot state to MSP430F147.\nThe data collection module receives different type of data\nfrom sensors. To enhance the robot safety, we designed the\nrobot self-diagnosis module, which judges whether the robot\nhas fault according to the sensors data.\nIV. THE SSTIR MODELING\nA. DYNAMIC MODEL OF THE SSTIR\nIt is well know that hydrodynamic theory can be used to\nanalyze the dynamic model of the SSTIR in the transformer\noil. In order to study the dynamic model and kinematics\nmodel of the SSTIR, two reference frames are considered,\nthe earth-ﬁxed frame Eξζη and the body-ﬁxed frame Oxyz,\nas shown in Fig. 8. The body-ﬁxed frame Oxyz is ﬁxed to this\nrobot hull. The center of robot buoyancy is the origin O of\nthe body-ﬁxed frame, the body axes Ox , Oy, and Oz coincide\nwith the principal axes of inertia.\nThe dynamic model of AUV could be derived from the\nNewton-Euler equations. Referring to dynamic model of\nAUV [32], [33], 6-DOF nonlinear equation of the SSTIR is\nexpressed as,\n(MRB +MA) ˙V +(CRB (V )+CA (V ))V\n=i +G −D (V )V +We (1)\nwhere, V = [u,v,w,p,q,r]T , in which u, v, w, p, q and\nr represent surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch, and yaw veloc-\nities. MRB is the rigid body system inertia matrix, MA is\nthe added mass matrix, CRB (V ) is the rigid body Coriolis\nand centripetal matrix, CA (V )is the hydrodynamic Coriolis\nand centripetal matrix, i is a generalized force and moment\ndue to oil-jet thruster, G is vector of gravitational/buoyancy\nforces and moments, D (V ) is the damping matrix, We =[\nWu,Wv,Ww,Wp,Wq,Wr\n]T is vector of environmental dis-\nturbances. The environmental disturbances are mainly caused\nby robot motion.\nBefore the dynamic model of the SSTIR is analyzed,\nwe give the following assumption,\n(i) The center of gravity and the center of buoyancy are\nlocated vertically on the Oz-axis. So, the center of gravity in\nthe body-ﬁxed frame is\n(\n0,0,zg\n)\n.\n(ii) The robot has homogeneous mass distribution, and the\nrobot structure is symmetrical about the Oxz-plane and Oyz-\nplane and approximate symmetrical about the Oxy-plane.\nSo that, the products of inertia can be expressed as Ixy =\nIyz=Ixz =0.\n(iii) The maximum speed of this robot is only 0.15m/s, the\nrobot moves at a slow speed.\nIn this case, the matrices MRB can be expressed as,\nMRB =\n\n\n\nm 0 0 0 mzg 0\n0 m 0 −mzg 0 0\n0 0 m 0 0 0\n0 −mzg 0 Ix 0 0\nmzg 0 0 0 Iy 0\n0 0 0 0 0 Iz\n\n\n\n(2)\nwhere, m is the mass of this robot, Ix , Iy, Iz are the moments\nof inertia about the Ox , Oy and Oz axes.\nBased the assumption (ii) (iii), we can neglect the contribu-\ntion from the off-diagonal elements in the added mass matrix\nMA [32].

According to the installation mode of oil-jet\nthruster, there is no moment acting on the robot in pitch and\nroll directions. Therefore, the momentsT p =Tq =0. We can\nneglect robot movements in pitch and roll direction. Due to\nthe symmetry of the robot, the representation equation Fu is\nsimilar withFv. So, we give only the equation of Fu. When this\nrobot moves forward in the surge direction, Fu is represented\nas,\nFu =(F3 +F4)cos 45\n◦\n=\n√\n2\n2 (F3 +F4) (8)\nwhere, F3 and F4 represent the reactive force of oil-jet\nthrusters T3,T4 respectively.\nReferring to Equ. 8, the forces and moments on the robot\nin the other direction of the horizontal plane can be easily\nexpressed. When this robot moves downward in the heave\ndirection, Tw is represented as,\nTw =F5 +F6 (9)\nwhere, F5 and F6 represent the reactive force of oil-jet\nthrusters T5,T6 respectively. If Fw=0, the robot moves\nupward in heave direction by the buoyancy force.\nSince the oil-jet thruster cannot provide upward thrust,\nthe robot can only rely on robot buoyancy to move upward.\nTherefore, the buoyancy force (B) of robot is greater than\nits gravity (W ). Since the center of robot Buoyancy (CB) is\nthe origin O of the body-ﬁxed frame, the coordinates of CB\nis (0,0,0).

MODELING OF SINGLE OIL-JET THRUSTER\nThe thrust of oil-jet thruster is related to the angular velocity\nof motor, the diameter of nozzle, velocity of incoming ﬂow,\nand so on. In order to establish dynamic modeling of oil-jet\nthruster, we give the internal structure of the oil-jet pump,\nas shown in Fig. 9. Where, Vi is velocity of incoming ﬂow,\nω is angular velocity of the motor, Vc is the central ﬂow\nvelocity in the nozzle, D is diameter of nozzle, and Vo is\nvelocity of outlet ﬂow. There are four blades, the motor shaft\nis perpendicular to the nozzle.

The experiment scheme.\npaper [37]. With reference to the method in [37], we gives\nthe thrust equation of oil-jet thruster.\nF =π\n4 ρD2\n(\nk2\n1 V 2\no +2k1k2VoDω+k2\n2 D2ω\n2)\n(14)\nVo =k1Vi +k2Vc (15)\nVc =1\n2Dω (16)\nwhere, ρ is the density of transformer oil. The velocity of\noutlet ﬂow Vo is a linear combine of incoming ﬂow velocity\nand the central ﬂow velocity. k1and k2 are the proportion-\nality factor. Since unknown parameters k1,k2,Vo cannot be\nobtained by theoretical analysis, we designed an experiment\nto identify these parameters.\nThe Equ. (14) shows that the thrust of oil-jet thruster\nmainly depends on the motor speed. Motor speed is deter-\nmined by the control voltage and input voltage of the motor.\nTherefore, the purpose of these experiments is to calculate\nthe relationship between control voltage, input voltage and\nthe thrust of oil-jet thruster. Since general dynamometer is\nnot used in transformer oil, we design the thrust experimental\nsystem of oil-jet thruster based on lever principle, as shown\nin Fig. 10. The experimental system consists of dynamometer,\noil-jet thruster, control unit, power supply, transformer oil,\nand lever with ball bearings. The oil-jet thruster is ﬁxed on\nthe lever, and placed in the transformer oil. The control unit\ncan accept an input voltage range of 10-12V. The control unit\ncan control the ﬂow of oil-jet thruster by a control voltage\nsignal range of 0.7-3.5V.\nAccording to the lever principle, the Equ. (17) is valid.\nF1 ×L1 =F2 ×L2 (17)\nIf L1 =L2, then F1 =F2.\nFIGURE 11. The experiment results.\nTo research oil-jet thruster modeling, we conducted mul-\ntiple tests. To verify input voltage effects, we operated the\noil-jet thruster under various input voltages: 10V, 10.5V, 11V,\n11.5V, 12V. To verify control voltage effects, we operated\nthe thruster under various control voltages, which change by\n0.1V increments in the range of 0.7-3.5V. The measurement\nerror was reduced by calculating the average value.\nFig.11 shows the result of the thruster force versus control\nvoltage under various input voltages. The results indicate\nthat the thruster force will increase as the control voltage\nincreases. When the control voltage is above 3.2V, the thrust\nof thruster will increase as the input voltage increases. The\nmaximum thruster force is 0.63N under the control voltage\nof 3.2V and the input voltage of 12V.\nThe battery voltage range of robot is approximately\n11-12V. We use the data ﬁtting method to get the relationship\nbetween the thruster force and control voltage under the input\nvoltage 11.5V, as shown in Equation (18).\nF =0.0586U2 +0.0029U −0.0215 (18)\nwhere, F is the thruster force of oil-jet thruster, U is the\ncontrol voltage.\nV. CONTROLLER DESIGN\nA. DECOUPLED DYNAMICS MODEL OF THE SSTIR\nWhen AUV moves at low speed, the equation of motion can\nbe divided into three non-interacting subsystems, including\nthe speed system, the steering subsystem, and the diving sub-\nsystem [32]. Since this paper researches the control method\nfor the robot hovering, we only focus on the diving subsystem\nand the steering subsystem of the robot. In the diving system,\nthe decoupled depth dynamics model of the robot can be\nsimpliﬁed as,\n\n\n\n˙Z =w\n(m −Z˙w)˙w +\n(\nZw +Zw|w||w|)\nw\n=Fw +B −M +Ww\n(19)\nVOLUME 8, 2020 76293\nY.

Once the robot stays at the target depth, the yaw\ncontrol will be activated. Fig.12 shows the block diagram of\nthe cascade control system.\nB. DEPTH CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN\nBased on the decoupled depth dynamics model of the robot,\nwe put forward block diagram of depth control system,\nas shown in Fig.13. The depth gauge feeds back depth infor-\nmation during the depth control. Depth control system con-\nsists of self-learning controller and adaptive sliding mode\nbackstepping controller.\n1) SELF-LEARNING CONTROLLER\nThe positive buoyancy mainly depends on the density of\ntransformer oil. Transformer oil is aging for long-time high\ntemperature and voltage transformer environment [38]. The\nOil aging will change its density. Therefore, the positive\nbuoyancy cannot be obtained by theoretical calculations.\nWe design self-learning controller to get the control voltage\nof oil-jet thruster Fd , whose thrust will counteract the positive\nbuoyancy of the SSTIR. The ﬂow diagrams of self-learning\ncontroller are shown in Fig. 14, where F is the increase\nvoltage, k is the proportional constant, Zd is the desired depth\nof the robot is Zd , Z is the present depth of the robot, 1Z is\nthe depth threshold, and n is the thrust threshold.\n2) ADAPTIVE SLIDING MODE BACKSTEPPING CONTROL\nThe control voltage of oil-jet thruster Fd can counteract\nthe positive buoyancy of the SSTIR. The positive buoyancy\nshould be neglected in designing a depth controller. Equa-\ntion (19) can be further simpliﬁed as,\n{\n˙Z =w\n˙w =Aww +BwFw +Ww\n(21)\nwhere Aw =−(Zw+Zw|w||w|)\nm−Z ˙w , Bw = 1\nm−Z ˙w .Ww is a disturbance\nforce vector, |Ww|<δ, ˙Ww=0.\nSuppose the desired depth of the robot is Zd , the present\ndepth of the robot is Z.

There\nare two scenarios used for testing hover-style control of robot:\ndepth control in vertical plane, and yaw control in horizontal\nplane.\nTABLE 1.

DEPTH CONTROL IN VERTICAL PLANE\nThe Self-learning controller parameters are given directly\nin the simulation experiments. The adaptive sliding mode\nbackstepping controller is given by Equation (30). The depth\nof the robot starts from the surface, and is programmed with\nfour consecutive depth demands of 1.5, 2, 1.5 and 1m. The\ncontrasts between single neuron PID controller and adaptive\nsliding mode backstepping controller in the depth control are\nshown in Fig. 15 and 16.

The velocity of\nASMBC is smaller than SN-PID in the steady state. As shown\nin Fig. 15 and 16, with consideration of the overshoot, the\nsetting time, and the steady state, the ASMBC controller is\nobviously superior to the SN-PID.\nB. YAW CONTROL IN HORIZONTAL PLANE\nThe adaptive sliding mode backstepping controller for yaw\nis given by Equation (37). The initial yaw angle of the\nrobot is 210 ◦, with the desired yaw angle of 170 ◦ and\n190◦. The performance of the ASMBC controller is com-\npared to the SN-PID controller.

As shown in Fig. 17,\nthe convergence speed of ASMBC was faster than SN-PID\ncontroller. The maximum deviation of ASMBC is 8 ◦, which\nis smaller than SN-PID. There hardy existed overshoot in the\nsteady state. The maximum deviation of ASMBC is within\nFIGURE 17. Yaw control results in the simulation experiments.\nFIGURE 18.

The contrasts of velocity control results are shown\nin Fig. 18, where the blue solid line is the control result with\nASMBC controller, the red solid line is the control result with\nSN-PID controller. The robot moves smoothly with ASMBC\ncontroller. As shown in Fig. 17 and 18, with consideration\nof the overshoot, convergence speed, and the steady state,\nthe ASMBC controller is a more reliable controller with a\nbetter performance.\nVII.

The initial yaw angle of the robot is 2 ◦, with\nthe desired yaw angle of 150 ◦. The depth control results are\nshown in Fig. 20 and 21. As shown in Fig. 20, self-learning\ncontroller is carried out to obtain Fd at ﬁrst. Then, the depth\ncontroller with the Equation (30) starts to control movement\nin vertical plane. The maximum deviation is within 1cm in\nthe steady state. The performance of the depth control is sat-\nisfactory, as the overshoot, the setting time state steady state\nare small.

CONCLUSION\nA new spherical submersible transformer inspection robot is\ndesigned for the problem of locating and identifying the faults\nof oil-immersed transformers in this paper. The shape struc-\nture of the robot is spherical which has a zero turning radius\nwith multi-degree of freedom movements. The movement of\nthe spherical robot is susceptible to external distracters. The\ncascade control system based on the ASMBC is put forward\nfor hovering control of the spherical robot. Both simulation\nexperiments and real trials were carried out to verify the per-\nformance of the design controller. The results of transformer\napplication tests show that the robot can take the place of\nthe manual inspection to complete the fault detection tasks.\nHovering control is the basis for autonomous observation of\nrobot in the oil-immersed transformer.
