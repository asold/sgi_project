Lesieutre \nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology \nCambridge, MA 02139, USA \nAbstract \nMoisture in solid insulation has detrimental effects on \ntransformer life. When the system is not in \nequilibrium, laboratory measurements with multiple \nwavelength interdigital sensors using the imposed \nfrequency-wavenumber (a-k) dielectromety technique \nhave proved to be an effective way to measure complex \npermittivity distribution in solid insulation which is \ndirectly related to the moisture distribution. \nMeasurements of oil-free and oil-impregnated \npressboard using interdigital sensors with changes in \nambient moisture concentration are presented. A \ncomparison between existing moisture equilibrium \ncurves for the oil-paper system and experimental \nresults is given. Measurements are also performed for \nanti-static additive in oil and the dielectrometry effects \nare discussed. \ncontent is then related to the measurable dielectric \nproperties by a calibrated mapping [ 11. \nThe improved design of the three-wavelength sensor is \nshown in Figure 1. Three sets of copper electrodes are \ndeposited on the common Teflon substrate and \nconnected to the interface circuitry. \nWith cD the complex voltage amplitude of the driven \nelectrode and cs the complex voltage amplitude of the \nfloating electrode loaded by known capacitance CL, the \ncomplex voltage gain of the sensor is determined by: \n(1) \nwhere conductance GI and capacitance C, reflect \nmaterial properties. \nG=-= ,. i', GI, + jot,, \nV, GI2 +joC,, +joC, ' \nIntroduction \nThe presence of moisture in transformer insulation \ndirectly affects the system performance, so it is \ndesirable to monitor its moisture content. For the oil, \nthere are commercial available sensors to measure the \nmoisture directly, and in equilibrium, the moisture \ncontent in the pressboard can be obtained using the \npartitioning curves between paper and oil. However, \nfor solids there is no continuous monitor for moisture \nunder non-equilibrium conditions. The interdigital \nsensor is able to measure the dielectric properties of \nliquid and solid insulation by applying the sensor to the \nsurface of the material to be tested. This paper \npresents results of moisture dynamics of pressboard in \nair and in oil using dielectrometry measurements. \nAccording to the concepts of o-k dielectrometry, \napplication of the spatially periodic potential with \nwavelength A=21Jk and angular frequency ~2nf to a \nsurface of a test dielectric generates an electric field \nwhich penetrates into the volume of the tested material. \nConsequently, the conduction and displacement \ncurrents which flow into the sensing electrodes depend \non the dielectric properties of the sample. The moisture \nFigure 1. The latest design of the three-wavelength \nsensor with wavelengths of 2.5, 5.0, and 1.0 mm [2]. \nThe test facility is shown in Figure 2.

The test sample is brought to 2 \ntorr pressure to observe the drying process of \npressboard. As the moisture leaves pressboard under \nvacuum, the pressboard becomes more insulating. The \ndynamic process is demonstrated by the frequency shift \nof the measured gain and phase to lower frequency in \nFigure 3. Eventually the pressboard behaves as an \ninsulator within the measurement frequency range \n(GI2=0), thus the sensing circuitry is a voltage divider \nbetween two capacitors CI2 and (CL: constant voltage \ngain with zero phase shift as given in (1). The \nresponses of the other two wavelengths are similar, but \ndue to different penetration depth, as the moisture \ndiffuses from the outer region of the pressboard, the 5 \nmm curves shift to the left in frequency first followed \nby the 2.5 mm and then the 1 mm wavelengths. \nIn another experiment the reverse: process is observed \nsimultaneously using a three-wavelength sensor and a \nlarge single-wavelength sensor by introducing wet oil \nto vacuum dried oil-impregnated pressboard of 1 mm \nthickness. The moisture in the oil diffuses into the \npressboard and the gain and phase of the sensor \nmeasurements change primarily due to the increase in \nthe conductivity. \nWith different penetration depths, Figure 4 shows that \nthe 5 mm wavelength changes immediately while the \n1 mm wavelength does not detect the change until \nalmost 30 hours later when the moisture diffuses into \n-35 \nthe inner region of the pressboard.

This might correspond to the observations of \nRushall in [4] that the loss tangent of the pressboard \nincreases exponentially above 4% moisture. \nf= 1 Hz, T=70 C \nFigure 5. Moisture measurement using 1 mm single- \nwavelength sensor. \nThe final moisture content in the pressboard and oil \ncan be calculated using mass balance either from \nmeasurement or predicted by the oil-paper equilibrium \nmoisture curves. An example is given for the moisture \ndata of oil for a similar test. \nMethod 1: The relative humidity of the oil is \nmeasured by the Harley moisture sensor shown in \nFigure 2 to be about 58% at the beginning and 32% in \nthe end equilibrium state. Using the moisture \nsolubility of oil at 7OoC to be 358 PPM [5], this \ncorresponds to 208 PPM and 115 PPM moisture \nconcentration, respectively. With the total oil mass \n5300g, we calculate that 0.49g of moisture diffuses \nfrom the oil to the pressboard. This corresponds to a \n4.0% increase of moisture in the pressboard weighing \nMethod 2: Partitioning of water between cellulose and \noil has been studied by a number of investigators. A \ncomparison for different curves is shown in Table 1. \nThe difference between the curves is probably due to \ndifferent materials used to generate the curves or \ndifferences in measurement technique. \nWe could not directly determine how much moisture \nwill be in the pressboard in the equilibrium state for \nour test from any of the above published curves, since \nnone of them gives moisture concentration in oil \ngreater than 100 PPM while our equilibrium is at 115 \nPPM. However, by inspection, we find the Fabre- \nPichon and Griffin curves won’t fit the data, because \neven at 80 PPM those curves already indicate almost \n4% moisture in paper; the value that corresponds to \n115 PPM will be about 6% by extrapolation and much \n12g. \nmore than the 4% estimated in Method 1. We \nregenerated the Oommen cumes for a wider moisture \nrange as shown in Figure 6 based on the method \nOommen proposed in [5] and using the solubility of \nwater data for oil [SI and adsorption curves for wood \npulp made from Jeffries’ Data [RI by Oommen in \nFigure 4 of [SI. Since the adsorption curves in [5] all \nmerge near the origin, the region belaw 1% Water in \nPaper in Figure 6 is not very accurate. \nTable 1 Comparison of moisture content in paper. \nFigure 6. Moisture equilibrium curves for oil and \npaper system using Oommen’s method [SI . \nThe straight line is the mass conservation curve based \non the equation: \nlV1 paper \nwhere WtOtn~ (g) is the total moisture mass in the \nsystem, which is also the moisture in the oil at the \nbeginning since we start with very dry pressboard; WO, \n(g) is the moisture mass in oil during the experiment, \nwhich equals the water in oil (PPM) times the total oil \nmass; Adpoper (g) is the mass of the pressboard. Ppaper \n(%) is the percentage of water in pressboard. \nSubstituting these numbers to (2) gives: \n(3) Ppaper(%)=9. 1-0.044. Water in Oil (PPM) , \nThe line is completely defined by the initial condition \nand the system configuration, i.e. independent of the \nfinal moisture measurement. The intersection of the \nmass conservation line with the moisture partitioning \n228 \ncurves at 70°C indicates the equili.brium value for the \nsystem. From this curve, the final moisture in oil is \nabout 122 PPM and the moisture in paper is about \n3.7%.
